    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3216 Poster Board III-153 Background Plerixafor, an inhibitor of CXCR-4/SDF-1 binding, is approved for mobilization of peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells (PBHSC) prior to autologous hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (AHSCT) for non-Hodgkin lymphomas and multiple myeloma (MM). In this context, plerixafor decreases the necessary number of days of apheresis and increases the proportion of patients reaching a target CD34+ cell count in the final product. Plerixafor, however, is expensive and not necessary in all patients undergoing PBHSC mobilization. We developed a cost-saving decision making algorithm that utilizes the CD34+ count in the peripheral blood on the 4 th day of G-CSF administration (PB-CD34+) and the target CD34+ count for the specific patient (T-CD34+) to decide between starting collection on day 4 and continuing G-CSF administration only (G approach) or adding Plerixafor the night before each apheresis session and starting apheresis on day 5 (G+P approach) ( Figure 1 ). Methods We reviewed mobilization and collection data in 50 consecutive mobilizations without the use of plerixafor in lymphoma and MM patients from our program to establish a mathematical correlation between PB-CD34+ and the average CD34+ count in the daily apheresis product (AP-CD34+). Based on available literature, we estimated a 3 fold increase in AP-CD34+ on each day of apheresis (starting on day 5) for a given PB-CD34+ with the addition of daily plerixafor. Reoccurring charges associated with mobilization and collection were based on charge for daily G-CSF administration (G) of $ 768.90, daily Plerixafor administration (P) of $ 7812.00, and average daily charges for apheresis (A) of $ 6922.00. The projected number of days of apheresis for each approach (N G and N G+P ) was estimated by rounding up to the next natural number the ratio between T-CD34+and AP-CD34+. Total charges with G approach was estimated to be = (3+ N G ) x G + N G x A and with G+P approach = (4+ N G+P ) x G + N G+P x A + N G+P x P. Results The projected AP-CD34+ with the G approach was found to be = (PB-CD34+ x 131,857 \u2013 389,334) (R 2 = 0.899). Consequently, the projected AP-CD34+ with the G+P approach was = 3 x (PB-CD34+ x 131,857 \u2013 389,334). As expected, the G approach was more cost effective with high PB-CD34+. However, the G+P approach was more cost effective with low PB-CD34+ and it was possible to determine, for each T-CD34+, a maximum PB-CD34+ for which the G+P approach is cost effective ( Table 1 ). This algorithm is being validated in our practice. After inclusion of 19 patients in the validation cohort (mostly patients at high risk for mobilization failure, median PB-CD34+ = 12), 6 (31.6%) patients completed collections with the G approach and 13 (68.4%) with the G+P approach. None of the patients have required more apheresis sessions than projected by this algorithm to meet the pre specified T-CD34+. Validation will continue at an approximate rate of 5 mobilizations/month and final results will be presented at the meeting. Conclusion A simple cost-saving algorithm was developed to support the decision on the fourth day of G-CSF mobilization to proceed with daily G-CSF and apheresis or to add daily plerixafor, based solely on collection target and peripheral blood CD34+ count. Preliminary validation data endorses the accuracy of this algorithm.
