    "abstract_text": "Background: Lumbar puncture and intrathecal chemotherapy are stressful interventions and induce significant anxiety to patients. Education for patients and caregivers has a fundamental role in addressing patient's concerns and alleviating their anxiety. The aim of the study is to determine the effect of video assisted education to cancer patients who are scheduled to receive intrathecal chemotherapy by measuring anxiety level and knowledge transfer. Method: Thirty-seven patients who were scheduled for intrathecal chemotherapy were randomly assigned into two groups: group I which received conventional education using verbal and written handouts, and group II which received video assisted education before going for intrathecal chemotherapy. Anxiety levels were measured using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scale. Knowledge transfer regarding intrathecal chemotherapy technique, potential risks, and importance were assessed by using approved standardized questionnaires for both groups. Result: A significant difference in anxiety scorewas noted among the two groups.Anxiety level of group I (12.31\u00b18.84) and group II (6.16 \u00b1 5.91), (P-value 0.018). Some categories in Beck Anxiety Inventory scale were more affected than others. Palpitation, frightening, lightheadedness, and hot/cold sweats were significantly reduced in the video group compared to the conventional education group. Moreover, knowledge transfer was significantly higher in group II (7.61\u00b11.88) compared to group 1(6.00 \u00b1 1.00), (P-value 0.003). Conclusion: The video assisted method of education before intrathecal chemotherapy is effective in reducing patients' anxiety and improving knowledge transfer to patients. This is probably because both visual and auditory senses are involved through multimedia and/or infographics in patient education. This educational method has the potential to be applied for other therapeutic procedures/interventions in order to decrease the stress caused by such interventions.
