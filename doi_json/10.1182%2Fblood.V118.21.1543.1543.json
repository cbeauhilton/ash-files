    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1543 BMS-936564/MDX-1338 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes human CXCR4 and is currently in phase 1 studies in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and multiple myeloma (MM). CXCR4 has been identified as a prognostic indicator for AML and other malignancies, in which greater expression of CXCR4 correlates with disease severity. CXCR4 is a seven-transmembrane, G-protein-coupled receptor in the CXC chemokine receptor family. In response to stimulation by its ligand, the chemokine CXCL12, CXCR4 activates calcium flux, chemotaxis and mediates directional migration of hematopoietic cells. In healthy adults, the receptor is predominantly expressed on B and T cells, monocytes, macrophages, NK and dendritic cells, as well as lymphoid and myeloid precursor cells. Expression of CXCR4 is elevated in a variety of cancers and the interaction of CXCR4 on tumor cells with CXCL12 in the bone marrow promotes tumor cell survival and growth. An antagonist of this pathway is predicted to be efficacious in a variety of hematologic malignancies. In vitro studies demonstrate that BMS-936564/MDX-1338 binds to CXCR4expressing cells with low nanomolar affinity. The antibody blocks CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 expressing cells and inhibits CXCL12 induced migration and calcium flux with low nanomolar EC50 values. When given as monotherapy on established tumors, the antibody exhibits anti-tumor activity in multiple AML, NHL and MM xenograft models. BMS-936564/MDX-1338 is an IgG 4 and thus does not elicit complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) or antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that BMS-936564/MDX-1338 induces apoptosis as one mechanism of tumor growth inhibition. Here we describe the in vitro and in vivo characterization and activities of BMS-936564/MDX-1338. Disclosures: Kuhne: Bristol-Myers Squibb: Employment. Mulvey: Bristol-Myers Squibb: Employment.
