    "abstract_text": "Background Despite active frontline regimens including venetoclax (V) plus obinutuzumab (O) and continuous BTK inhibitors (BTKi), the outcomes for some CLL patients (pts) remain suboptimal. The ibrutinib (I) plus V doublet and IVO triplet are active (Jain et al., NEJM, 2019, Huber et al., EHA, 2020), but are associated with cardiac and infectious toxicities. We hypothesized that a time-limited triplet with a more specific BTKi acalabrutinib (A) with V and O (AVO) would be well-tolerated and active. We report updated data from a phase 2 trial of AVO in previously untreated CLL pts enriched for high risk disease. Methods This ongoing phase 2 investigator-initiated study (NCT03580928) initially enrolled unselected pts with previously untreated CLL. A recent protocol amendment restricted additional enrollment to pts with TP53 aberrant CLL. Additional eligibility: treatment required per iwCLL criteria, ECOG PS \u2264 2, CrCl \u226550ml/min, ANC \u2265500/mm 3 , and platelets \u226530,000/mm 3 . A, V, and O are started sequentially, with a 28-day lead-in with A at 100 mg bid, then 2 cycles of AO (with O at standard dosing), then AO plus a 4-week V ramp-up beginning C4D1 with 20 mg, then 50 mg on C4D2, then weekly ramp-up to 400 mg qd. After 3 more AVO cycles (6 total cycles of O), AV continues from C8-C15; pts with bone marrow undetectable MRD (BM-uMRD) CR after C15 may discontinue therapy, while all others continue AV until completing C24, with the option to discontinue if BM-uMRD then. Response by 2018 iwCLL criteria, with central MRD testing by 8-color flow cytometry in peripheral blood (PB) and BM at 10 -4 . Primary endpoint: rate of BM-uMRD CR at C16D1. Non-heme AEs by CTCAE v5.0, and heme toxicity by iwCLL criteria. Results As of July 24, 2020, 44 pts were accrued. Median age: 63 yrs (range: 41-78), 68% male. Baseline prognostics: TP53 aberrant (either del(17p) and/or TP53 mutation) in 17 (39%) pts, del(11q) in 12 (27%) pts, complex karyotype (3 or more changes) in 9 (20%) pts, unmutated IGHV in 29 (66%) pts. With a median follow-up of 19 mo. (range 6-26), 43 pts remain on study (1 withdrew consent after 6 mo. due to GI symptoms). Of 36 pts with at least 16 mo. of follow-up, the overall response rate is 100% (43% CR/CRi, 57% PR [in most cases due to small residual lymph nodes]), with 31% BM-uMRD CR at C16 (primary endpoint). By ITT at C16, 84% PB-uMRD and 78% BM-uMRD. In the 10 pts with TP53 -aberrant disease who have reached C16 to date, 4 had CR and 6 had PR, with 9/10 pts PB-uMRD and 7/10 pts BM-uMRD. Response and uMRD did not differ based on IGHV status. Eleven pts in BM-uMRD CR discontinued therapy as allowed per protocol after 15 cycles. Median time off therapy for these pts is 4 mos (range: 1-10). No pts have progressed to date. The most frequent non-heme AEs have been headache (80%, 61% gr1, 16% gr2, 2% gr3), fatigue (77%, 75% gr 1+2, 2% gr3), bruising (57%, 55% gr1, 2% gr2), nausea (45%, all gr 1/2), hypocalcemia (34%, 32% gr 1+2, 2% gr3), rash 32% (30% gr1, 2% gr2), and diarrhea (27%, 18% gr1, 9% gr2). Gr 3/4 heme toxicities: neutropenia (34%), thrombocytopenia (23%), and anemia (4.5%). G-CSF was used in 5 pts (11%). Infusion-related reactions occurred in 11 pts (25%, 23% gr1+2, 2% gr3). One case of gr3 afib (2%) and no cases of major bleeding or febrile neutropenia were observed. 6 pts required dose reductions, including 4 who reduced both A and V, and 1 pt each who reduced A or V alone. SAEs: gr4 neutropenia (n=4), and 1 pt each with gr3 lung infection, cardiac troponin increase, thrombocytopenia, and hyperkalemia. Gr\u22653 infection occurred in 1 pt (2.3%). Transient lab TLS occurred in 2 pts (4.5%), both gr3 just after starting O (prior to any V). 41/44 pts (93%) were medium or high risk for TLS at baseline, but only 3 pts (7%) were medium risk at V initiation on C4D1. Five low or medium risk pts were admitted at investigator discretion for V initiation. Conclusion The AVO triplet is highly active, with 78% achieving BM-uMRD after 15 months of time-limited therapy in a frontline CLL population that included nearly 40% pts with TP53 aberrant disease. No pts have progressed, with a median of 19 months follow-up. The safety profile is favorable, with a 2% rate of \u2265Gr3 infection and afib, and no TLS due to V, which was given with a more convenient 4-week ramp-up. AVO is now being studied in a registrational phase 3 trial CL-311 (NCT03836261) with the potential to define a new standard frontline therapy option for CLL pts.
