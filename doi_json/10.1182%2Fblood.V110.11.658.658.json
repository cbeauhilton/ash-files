    "abstract_text": "Background: Primary Systemic Amyloidosis (AL) is a fatal disorder characterized by uncontrolled deposition of light chain derived amyloid with variable survival dependent on extent of organ involvement and degree of individual organ dysfunction. We previously demonstrated that troponin T (cTnT) and N-terminal fragment of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP) together can allow prognostic stratification in AL. Uric acid (UA) is a marker of increased mortality in congestive heart failure and we examined its prognostic value in AL. Methods: A cohort 1977 patients with AL seen at our institution and 293 patients with AL undergoing stem cell transplant (PBSCT) were studied retrospectively to examine the value of serum UA. Results: The median OS for those with UA>8mg/dL was 9 months from diagnosis (95% CI; 7.4, 10.6) compared to 20.3 months for those with UA0.035g/L was 6.7 months (95% CI; 5.0, 8.4) compared to 35.2months (95% CI; 29.4, 41.0) for those with cTnT 332ng/L was 11.8 months (95% CI; 9.4, 14.2) compared to 36.2 months (95% CI; 26.7, 45.8) for those with NT-ProBNP 8mg/dl, cTnT>0.035\u03bcg/L and NT-ProBNP>332ng/L) had a median OS of 36.6, 29.2, 11.1, and 3.6 months respectively (P15mm, ejection fractionupper limit of normal, serum creatinine>2.0mg/dL, serum albumin5gm, UA>8 mg/dL, cTnT>0.035\u03bcg/L and NT-ProBNP>332ng/L. We then performed a multivariate analysis with all these variables and those predicting for shorter OS were cTnT>0.035\u03bcg/L, serum uric acid>8mg/dL, and ejection fraction<50%. The stage determined at the time of PBSCT also predicted outcome with a median OS from PBSCT not reached in stages 1 and 2, 55 months for stage 3 and 16 months for stage 4 patients. Interpretation: The data confirms the prognostic value of serum UA in AL and allows development of a novel and simple but powerful, reproducible staging system with applicability at all stages of AL.
