    "abstract_text": "p53 is the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor gene in human cancer. However, in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) p53 is mutated only in a small subset of cases suggesting that modulation of wild-type-p53 (wt-p53) levels in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells may have therapeutic implications in these patients. MDM2 (HDM2 in humans) is a physiologic negative regulator of p53 levels through a well-established auto-regulatory feedback loop. Nutlin-3A is a recently developed small molecule, which antagonizes mdm2 through disruption of p53-MDM2 interaction resulting in p53 stabilization. We hypothesized that nutlin 3A may stabilize p53 in HRS cells carrying wt- p53 gene, thus leading to p53-dependent apoptosis and G1-S cell cycle arrest. We used two novel classical HL cell lines recently established in our Institution, MDA-V and MDA-E, which have been shown to carry wt- p53 gene. As a control, we used a HL cell line L-428 harboring a mutant p53 (mt- p53 ) gene product (deletion at exon 4). We investigated effects on apoptosis and cell cycle arrest after treatment of cultured HRS cells with nutlin-3A or a 150-fold less active enantiomere, nutlin-3B. Treatment with nutlin-3A resulted in substantial cell death (up to 65%) in a concentration-dependent manner associated with increased apoptosis as shown by apoptotic morphology (DAPI immunofluorescence), annexin V binding (flow cytometry) and caspase activation (Western blot analysis) in MDA-V and MDA-E cells, but not in L-428 cells. Nutlin-3A-induced apoptotic cell death was accompanied by stabilization of p53 protein as detected by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic Bax, a known target of p53. Inhibition of nuclear export by leptomycin B stabilized p53 at a similar level as compared to nutlin-3A treatment in these cells, suggesting that nutlin-3A stabilized p53 through inhibition of MDM2-mediated degradation of the protein. By contrast, no changes in cell viability, growth or apoptosis were seen after treatment with the inactive nutlin-3B small molecule. Treatment with nutlin-3A also resulted in a significant decrease (up to 85%) of cells in S-phase and a dose-dependent increase of cells in G1 phase of cell cycle as detected by flow cytometry, in MDA-V and MDA-E cells, but not in L-428 cells. Cell cycle arrest was associated with up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, a transcriptional target of p53. In contrast, treatment of HRS cells with nutlin-3B had no effects on the cell cycle irrespective of p53 mutation status. Furthermore, combined treatment with nutlin-3A and doxorubicin revealed synergistic effects and enhanced cytotoxicity in HRS cells with wt- p53 gene. Targeting MDM2 with the specific antagonist nutlin-3A that leads to non-genotoxic p53 activation, apoptosis induction and cell cycle inhibition may provide a new therapeutic approach for patients with HL."
