    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5305 Objective: There was a paper in favor of beta-globin gene carrier and insulin resistance. Considering the high prevalence of these individuals in north of Iran, the present study was designed to assess the relationship between a beta-globin gene carrier and developing insulin resistance. Methods: This historical cohort study was conducted on 164 people, including 82 healthy controls and 82 individuals with thalassemia minor. The two study groups were matched for age, body mass index(BMI) and family history of diabetes mellitus. Blood samples were taken for; CBC, fasting blood sugar(FBS), liver enzymes (AST, ALT), high sensitive C- reactive protein(CRP), serum insulin and a standard OGTT were performed in all. Insulin resistance was diagnosed based on homeostasis model assessment method(HOMA). TM was diagnosed if microcytic(MCV<80 fl) hypochromia(MCH<25 pg) was detected on CBC and HbA2 \u22653.5% using HPLC method. Controls had negative past medical history and normal CBC. Student T- Test and and Chi-Square test were used to compare demographic data. Relative Risk was measured to test the hypothesis. P<0.05 was considered as significant. Results: Age, gender, BMI, were similar. CRP, and AST were significantly higher in case group. (p value <0.05). The Relative Risk for diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance in the cases with minor thalassemia was 2 (CI % 95:1.8\u20132.5) and 2.02 (CI % 95:1.7\u20132.4), respectively. Conclusion: The risk of developing diabetes and insulin resistance in patients with thalassemia minor is two times greater than the general population. Considering the high serum levels of CRP in these cases, the inflammation noted in liver cells could be considered as the underlying cause of insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes in these patients.
