    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1819 Objectives: Osteoblasts (OB) and osteoclasts (OC), are an integral part of the bone microenvironment, and play a crucial role in myeloma growth and survival. Their imbalance results in osteolytic disease and elucidating the mechanisms underlying osteolytic lesions is important not only for the improvement of osteolytic bone disease but also for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). The osteocyte-secreted protein sclerostin, encoded by the SOST gene, is a potent inhibitor of osteoblastogenesis. It is regarded as a good target for osteoporosis treatment, but its role in MM remains to be determined. Our objective was to study the role of sclerostin in MM bone disease and determine if sclerostin directed strategies were a reasonable approach in MM. Methods and Results: Sclerostin concentration in patients' blood plasma and MM cell line supernatant stimulated by IL-6, FGF-2, TNFalpha, BMP7 and TGFbeta was detected by ELISA (ALPCO immunoassays). Increased level of sclerostin was detected in MM patient plasma (n=20, median: 4.73 ng/mL, range: 1.5\u201319.5 ng/mL). Plasma concentrations were significantly higher (p<0.01) when compared to sclerostin concentration in the plasma of leukemia patients (n=3), gastric cancer patients (n=40) and healthy volunteers (n=4). High sclerostin levels were not associated with extent of bone disease but rather correlated with tumor burden (High B2M, creatinine and LDH, and low Hb) suggesting an autocrine loop for sclerostin production. Because sclerostin is derived from mature OB or orteocytes, we measured levels during OB differentiation but we were unable to detect increased levels. We then measured sclerostin levels in RPMI-8226 MM cell line supernatant either alone or stimulated by cytokines D Systems). Conclusions: These data demonstrate that increased sclerostin levels in MM patients inhibit osteoblastogenesis and stimulate osteoclastogenesis. Taken together, sclerostin may be good target to inhibit myeloma bone disease and help restore normal bone homeostasis.
