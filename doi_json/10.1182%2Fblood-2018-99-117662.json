    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Epstein Barr virus-positive (EBV+) diffuse large B- cell lymphoma (DLBCL), not otherwise specified (NOS) is a new entity recognized by the WHO 2016. This entity was widely studied in older age patients, but in recent years there are few reports that show that EBV positive DLBCL, NOS can affect younger adults and there is a lack of evidence in this age group. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact on survival in EBV+ DLBCL, NOS in young adults. Methods: The study was retrospective, reviewing clinical records of patients treated at Rebagliati Martins Hospital between years 2002 - 2013. Patients of both sexes \u2265 18 years old, but \u2264 50 years old, with the diagnosis of EBV+DLBCL, NOS were included. IRB approval was obtained prior to research. Pathological samples were reviewed by hematopathologists at our institution to confirm the diagnosis. Pertinent clinicopathological data were collected through chart review and are presented using descriptive statistics. Overall survival (OS) was determinate according to the Kaplan -Meier method, the comparison of the survival curves were made with the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazard regression models were fitted to evaluate hazard ratios (HR) for OS. Results: A total of 57 patients with a diagnosis of EBV+DLBCL, NOS were included in this analysis. The median age at diagnosis was 43 years (range 25-50 years), 61 % of patients were older than 40 years old and there was a slight female predominance (51%). Clinically, 55% presented ECOG >1, 57% had B symptoms, 68% had an extranodal disease as a primary tumor, 50% had stage III/IV and 26% had \u2265 1 extranodal site involved. EBV positivity was present in 16% of patients (9 patients). PDL-1 expression was present in 12% of patients. 92% received first-line treatment, but 7% of patients did not for progressive disease and death at diagnosis. During the treatment, 92% of patients received R-CHOP and 8% received other regimens. The overall response rate was 71%; 63% had a complete response and 7% had a partial response. The 5-year OS rate was 59%. In the univariate analysis, EBV positivity (<0.001) and \u2265 1 extranodal site involved (p=0.011) were associated with a poor prognosis. In the multivariate analysis, patients with EBV positive had a worse outcome (HR 7.8, 95% 2.2-25.9.2; p=0.001). Conclusions: The prevalence of EBV in young adults with DLBCL is high compared with other series and there is an adverse impact on overall survival in this group of patients. Figure.
