    "abstract_text": "Background: With improved prognosis of patients with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (HL), interest increasingly focuses on high-risk groups such as elderly patients. We thus performed a retrospective analysis of the German Hodgkin Lymphoma Study Group (GHSG) database to determine clinical presentation, toxicity of treatment and outcome of elderly HL patients. Methods: A total of 4251 patients included in the GHSG studies HD5-9 were analysed of whom 372 (8.8%) were 60 years or older and 3879 (91.2%) were younger than 60 years. Patient characteristics, treatment results, toxicity, failure free survival (FFTF) and overall survival (OS) were compared. Results: The median age of the two cohorts was 65 and 31 years, respectively. Statistically significant differences in patient characteristics were as follows: elderly patients had more frequently mixed cellularity subtype (35% vs. 19%), B-symptoms (50% vs. 43%) and elevated ESR (59% vs. 51%). Less frequently observed in elderly patients were nodular sclerosis subtype (41% vs. 66%), large mediastinal mass (9% vs. 20%), bulky disease (49% vs. 60%) and Karnofski index <8, (11% vs. 3%). Acute toxicity during chemotherapy was higher in elderly patients (87% vs 79%). The most obvious differences were observed for infections (17% vs 6%). The significantly higher rate of infections was due to more severe leukopenia in elderly patients (grade IV: 41% vs 25%). As a result, significantly fewer elderly patients received at least 85% of intended chemotherapy dose (74% vs. 90%). At a median follow-up of 65 months, 38% and 11% of patients respectively died. The survival analysis showed a statistically significant poorer prognosis for elderly patients in terms of 5-year OS (65% vs. 90%), FFTF (60% vs. 79%) and Hodgkin-specific FFTF (73% vs. 82%). Conclusion: Elderly patients have a poorer risk profile compared to younger HL patients and experience more severe treatment-associated toxicity. Higher mortality during treatment as well as lower dose-intensity are the major factors explaining the poorer overall outcome of elderly Hodgkin lymphoma patients.",
