    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5112 Objective: To investigate the Mechanism of the apoptotic effect of brucine on human multiple myeloma. Method: U266 cells (5\u00d710 4 ) were plated in the presence or absence of the brucine (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg/ml) in 96 well culture plates for 24\u201372 h. The anti-proliferative response of brucine was assessed by MTT assay. The analysis of cell cycle of U266 cell with or without brucine was mesured by flow cytometry. The expression change of c-Jun after joining brucine, brucine and JNK specific inhibitor SP600125 was detected using RT-PCR. Results The apoptotic effect of brucine show a dose and time dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry revealed accumulation of cells at sub-G 0 /G 1 phase. The apoptosis rate separately were (4.137\u00b10.01)%, (10.55\u00b10.03)%, (12.31\u00b10.04)%, (27.67\u00b10.08)%, (29.67\u00b10.09)% (p<0.01). Detecting c-Jun gene expression respectively after joining brucine, brucine and JNK specific inhibitor SP600125 by RT-PCR. The gray scale values were (0.7961\u00b10.007),(0.4683\u00b10.003). Conclusions Within the 0.4mg/ml concentration of brucine can induce apoptosis in U266 cells. Brucine by JNK signaling pathway through phosphorylation of c-Jun induced apoptosis in U266 cells.
