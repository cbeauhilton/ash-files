    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2944 Background: ON 01910.Na a novel benzyl styryl sulfone derivative is under clinical development in hematologic malignancies. It is a multi-kinase/PI3 kinase inhibitor that promotes G2/M arrest and selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells. Leukemic cells exhibit significantly higher levels of sensitivity to ON 01910.Na compared to normal marrow progenitors and increasing cytotoxicity upon prolonged and repetitive exposure (Skidan Proc AACR 2006; Chen Proc AACR 2008). Azacitidine (AzaC), is first line therapy for patients (pts) with higher-risk MDS and produces a response rate of 50%. Pts relapsed or refractory to hypomethylating based therapies have a poor prognosis and there are no accepted effective second line treatments, thus a need for new agents. Methods: A phase I/II study of ON 01910.Na is being conducted in pts with hematological malignancies. In the phase I component pts are entered in cohorts of escalating doses in a classic 3+3 design in doses ranging from 650 up to 1700 mg/m 2 /d continuous IV infusion (CIV) for durations from 72 hours up to 144 hours every 2 weeks (1 cycle) for 4 cycles of treatment during the induction phase. Subsequent treatments are administered every 3 to 4 weeks. A CBC is performed weekly and a bone marrow (BM) is performed at baseline and week 4, 8, and then q3 months thereafter. Pts with higher-risk disease had to have failed a hypomethylating agent. Results: Ten pts with MDS or AML relapsed/refractory to a hypomethylating agent have been treated with ON 01910.Na thus far ( table 1 ). The study cohort comprised pts with a diagnosis (Dx) RAEB-2 (4 pts), RAEB-T (1 pt), and AML (5 pts) (median age of 75 years). Their cytogenetic profile included 1 pt with normal, 2 with intermediate (+8), and 7 pts with poor risk cytogenetics (monosomy 7 and/or complex). Patients were treated between 5 and 70 weeks. Responses according to IWG 2006 criteria were observed in the BM and peripheral blood: Marrow CR (3), hematologic improvement (HI-P) (2); erythroid (1) platelet (1). An additional 2 pts had a >50% BM blast decrease from baseline but not to <5%. Thus, 5/10 (50%) demonstrate a bone marrow response. Survival of these pts was 7.3, 15.7, and 16.4 months; one patient remains on study 5+ months. Four of the five responders had MDS at the initiation of treatment: RAEB-2 (3), CMMoL (1), AML (1). Responders had monosomy 7 (2), trisomy 8 (1) and complex cytogenetics (2). One pt had an elimination of the MDS clone and the others had persistence of the abnormal karyotype throughout their treatment course. Five pts had SD without HI at 4 weeks, 2 pts progressed to AML. All 5 non-responders had AML; 4 with a proliferative course. These latter received only 2 (2) or 3 (3) cycles before succumbing to disease related infectious complications. Survival for these patients ranged from 1.3 \u2013 2 months with a median duration on study of 42 days. The most frequent side effects grade 2 2 for all pts included fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and dysuria in patients receiving extended duration infusions. One pt had a grade 3 urinary frequency. No hematologic toxicities occurred and no bone marrow toxicity or hypoplasia was noted. Pharmacokinetic studies are ongoing, data to date demonstrate no evidence of drug accumulation in patients who are treated repeatedly. Conclusion: ON 01910.Na appears to be safe and well tolerated in patients with refractory or relapsed MDS and AML. ON 01910.Na has biologic activity with reduction in BM blasts, eradication of the MDS clone and improvement in the peripheral blood counts in some pts. These effects are associated with increased survival albeit in limited numbers of pts treated thus far. Further study of ON 01910.Na is warranted to better define biologic activity, appropriate target populations and to define mechanism of action. Table 1.  Pt ID . Initial Dx/OnStudy Dx .
