    "abstract_text": "Background: Rare diseases requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) present a challenge for BMT centers. The patients present at a low frequency, and there are often no established conditioning regimens for these disorders, especially for children without HLA matched sibling donors. We report the conditioning regimen using haploidentical related donors, and outcomes for the following rare disorders transplanted at our center from January 2013 through December 2015. During the past three years we had patients presented with the following: Fanconi anemia (FA), dyskeratosis congenital (DC), adrenal leukodystrophy (ALD) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). Methods: We treated these children with rare disorders that required SCT at our center, and are reporting the transplant outcomes for these rare diseases. Results: All children were transplanted with haploidentical related donors using G-CSF mobilized bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell. Conditioning regimens and treatment plans were mainly following Beijing protocol and varied with type of disease. Patient characteristics and outcomes are presented in Table 1. No graft failure occurred and three of 5 patients (60%) are alive and well with no evidence of disease. Conclusions: Our program has treated a variety of rare disorders with an event-free-survival rate of 60%. Our data suggests haploidentical SCT for rare pediatric diseases seems to be challenging and promising. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
