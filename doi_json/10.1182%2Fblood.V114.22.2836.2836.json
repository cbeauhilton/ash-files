Since the disease was first described in England around 1850, MM has been very resistant to treatment with common relapses. It has a poor prognosis with a median survival of 3\u20135 years, despite all treatment approaches. In recent years, evidence has been provided that thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) may play a permissive role in various cancer cells including breast, brain, prostate and lung, enhancing tumor cell proliferation. Deprivation of these hormones decreases cancer cell proliferation and enhances cell death and response rates to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. It was recently discovered that T3 and T4 exert their proliferating actions through binding to aVb3 integrin, a common cell surface receptor, leading to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and downstream intra cellular and nuclear events. Interestingly, aVb3 expression is increased during tumor progression and a spectrum of cancer cells, including MM, interact with this central integrin for their invasion, spreading and proliferation. In the current study, we hypothesized that that MM cells, similar to other cancer cells, are thyroid hormones sensitive and aimed to further investigate and characterize their effects on cell survival, proliferation and MAPK signaling. In addition, the additive/ supra additive effects of hypothyroid induction in MM cells on bortezomib's activity were evaluated. Methods: Cell lines: MM cell lines, RPMI 8226, U266, ARP1, ARK and CAG are cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS/antibiotics. Reagents and chemicals: Bortezomib (Velcade) is obtained from the hospital pharmacy. T3, T4, tetrac RGD and RGE peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). PE conjugatedb3 monoclonal antibodies (LM609) and mouse IgG are from Chemicon International. phosphorylated MAPK ERK1/2, p38, JunK antibodies are from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Alpha tubulin and PCNA antibodies are from Santa Cruz Biothecnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) WST-1 cell proliferation assay: WST-1 (10% final concentration) is incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h and read using microELISA reader at 440nm. Flow cytometry : Cell cycle: Cells are harvested, fixed and stained with DNA propidium iodide (PI) (50 \u03bcg/ml) /RNAse A (10mg/ml) and analyzed for DNA content by FACS. Analysis of apoptosis/necrosis: Cells (10 5 ) are incubated with 10 \u03bcl Annexin V (FITC conjugated)/5 \u03bcl PI and analyzed by FACS (Annexin+/PI-, early apoptosis; Annexin+/PI+, late apoptosis/necrosis). aVb3 in MM cells: Cells are harvested in RPMI 1640 and directly labeled with PE-aVb3 mAbs (10 mg/ml) and analyzed by FACS. Isotype-matched antibody, serves as negative control.Western blotting: Whole cell lysates were separated on 5-8% polyacrylamid gels and analyzed by western blot using antibodies for phosphorylated MAPK ERK1/2, p38, JunK and PCNA.Statistical analyses: Results were analyzed using unpaired students t test. Results: The sensitivity of myeloma cells to thyroid hormones was explored by addition of increasing concentrations of T3 and T4 to several myeloma cell lines. Results demonstrate that T3 and T4 significantly induced proliferation and cell number in these cells in accordance with PCNA protein elevation. This proliferating action was MAPK related, with phosphor ERK1/2, p38 and JunK elevated in a dose dependent manner. Mimicking hypothyroidism in the cells by using condition medium or T4 analog that block thyroid hormones binding to the integrin, tetrac, inhibited proliferation, increased apoptosis/necrosis and produced G2M arrest. Moreover, supra additive/additive \u201cdrug sparing\u201d effects of tetrac-botezomib were observed with significant reduction in survival and increase in apoptosis. Discussion: We present here, for the first time in myeloma, indication that myeloma cells, similar tp reports from other cancer types, are thyroid hormones sensitive and that hypothyroidism induction inhibits cell proliferation and sensitizes response to bortezomib. Conclusions: As most MM patients still relapse, new drugs combinations are needed to overcome resistance. Our novel chemosensitizing approach may potentially demonstrate the importance of thyroid hormones status in this disease and may suggest a protective effect of sub clinical hypothyroidism in MM as a useful and unique adjunct for MM therapy.
