    "abstract_text": "Background Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of non-hodgkin lymphoma with great heterogeneity in clinical behavior and response to treatment. Although the addition of rituximab to CHOP regimen has significantly improved the survival of DLBCL, 1/3 will be eventually relapse and progression. HIF1a has been reported to be related with the drug resistance in DLBCL, but the mechanism remains unknown. Methods Two DLBCL cell lines (Riva and SuDHL2) were treated with doxorubicin and HIF-1a inhibitors digoxin, YC-1. The proliferation of these cell lines (Riva and SuDHL2) were measured by MTT and apoptosis were detected by FCM after staining with Annexin V/SYTOX Green. Expression of IF-1\u03b1, PHD, xCT, GCLM and apoptosis-related proteins was detected by Western Blot. Results With the increase concentration of doxorubicin treatment, the proliferation of Riva and SuDHL2 cell lines could be gradually inhibited. xCT and GCLM expression were upregulated after treated with doxorubicin and can be reversed by N-acetylcysteine. HIF-1a inhibitors digoxin and YC-1 could inhibited the expression of xCT and GCLM, proliferation and apoptosis induced by doxorubicin. Furthermore, we treated shHIF-1a RNA to significantly reduce the expression of HIF-1a, and the decrease of HIF-1a expression enhanced the proliferation inhibition and apoptosis of lymphoma cells by Dox. Downregulation the expression of HIF-1a by shRNA enhanced the doxorubicin induced apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation in DLBCL cell lines. Conclusions Taken together, our results showed that HIF-1a could regulate the expression of xCT and GCLM and further mediate drug resistance in the diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
