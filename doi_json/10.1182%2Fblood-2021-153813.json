    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Anticoagulation plays a crucial role in the treatment of splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), including thrombosis of the portal (PVT), mesenteric (MVT) and splenic (SpVT) veins. Rivaroxaban is a potential alternative to heparins and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in these patients, but data to support its use are scant. Several recent guidelines highlighted the limited evidence available for the use of the direct oral anticoagulants in these patients. In addition, despite anticoagulation, SVT patients carry high risk of recurrent venous thromboembolic events. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban for the acute-phase treatment of SVT (first 3 months of treatment). Methods: RIVASVT-100 (NCT02627053) was a prospective cohort study of adult patients with a first episode of symptomatic, objectively diagnosed PVT, MVT or SpVT. Exclusion criteria were known liver cirrhosis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, previous or ongoing variceal bleeding, portal cavernoma, thrombocytopenia, severe renal failure, life expectancy 7 days, ongoing VKA treatment. Patients received rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks, followed by 20 mg once daily for a total of 3 months. Afterwards, the decision to continue any available anticoagulant drug was left to the discretion of the attending physicians. Follow-up was performed at 3 weeks, 2 months, 3 months and 6 months. Primary outcome was the occurrence of ISTH-defined major bleeding events during the 3 months of active treatment and up to 2 days after the end of study treatment. Secondary outcomes included death, clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB), recurrent SVT or symptomatic venous thromboembolism in other sites. We here report the results of the 3-month follow-up. Results: Between June 2015 and March 2021, 103 patients were enrolled from 18 participating centres. After excluding 3 patients who did not meet the criteria for eligibility, 100 patients were included in the analysis. Mean (SD) age was 54.4 (\u00b1 15.5) years; 64% were males. Overall, 74% of patients had PVT, 61% MVT and 48% SpVT; 53% of SVT occurred in multiple sites. The most common risk factors were abdominal inflammation/infection (26%), followed by solid cancer (9%), overt myeloproliferative neoplasms (9%) and oestrogen hormonal therapy (9%), while 43% of cases were unprovoked. The JAK2 V617F mutation was detected in 13 out of 50 tested patients (26%). Rivaroxaban was the sole anticoagulant agent used in 21% of patients, whereas the remaining received a combination of anticoagulants, which included low molecular weight heparin, unfractionated heparin or fondaparinux for a median of 5.0 days before transitioning to rivaroxaban. Three patients were lost to follow-up but known to be alive at the end of the study. At 3-month follow-up, 1 (1.0%) patient died due to a non-SVT related cause. Two patients (2.06%; 95% CI, 0.57-7.21) had major bleeding events (both gastrointestinal), while 3 patients (3.09%) had CRNMB. There were 2 recurrent SVT (2.06%) during rivaroxaban treatment, one of these occurred in a patient with metastatic solid cancer. The 6-month follow-up for the last enrolled patient is ongoing. Conclusions: Rivaroxaban appears to be safe and effective for the acute-phase treatment of SVT in non-cirrhotic patients.
