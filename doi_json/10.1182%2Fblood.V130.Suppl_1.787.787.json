    "abstract_text": "Mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are acquired hierarchically. Pre-leukemic mutations, such as AML1-ETO , are acquired within the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment as an early event, whereas signaling mutations, such as KRAS , are late events acquired within transformed leukemic progenitors and rarely detectable within the HSC compartment (PMID 24550281). This raises the possibility that signaling pathway mutations are detrimental to clonally expanded pre-leukemic HSC. To explore this hypothesis, we generated mice carrying A ml1 ETO/+ or Kras G12D/+ conditional knock-in alleles, either individually or combined (AEK), crossed to an Mx1- Cremouse line. Due to previously described spontaneous recombination in primary Kras G12D/+ mice with Mx1- Cre, competitive transplantation was performed using 250,000 fetal liver (FL) cells and 1x10 6 wild-type (WT) bone marrow (BM) competitor cells into lethally irradiated recipients. Mutations were induced with polyI:C 4 weeks post-transplantation, and mice were culled 8 weeks post-polyI:C to assess the hematopoietic phenotype. Transplantation of Aml1 ETO/+ FL was insufficient to induce a hematological malignancy in primary recipient mice. In contrast, recipients of Kras G12D/+ FL developed a fatal myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) including leukocytosis (white blood cell count 50\u00b122 x10 9 /L), anemia (11.5\u00b10.7 g/dL), splenomegaly (564\u00b171mg) and an increase in the Mac1 + Gr1 lo myeloid cells in the peripheral blood (fc = 10.04, p < 0.0001) and spleen (fc = 48.56, p < 0.0001) compared to WT. Strikingly, transplantation of AEK FL cells did not result in a more aggressive disease but led to the amelioration of key features of the MPN phenotype associated with Kras G12D/+ , including restoration of normal white blood cell count and hemoglobin levels, reduction in spleen size (fc = 0.69, p < 0.05) and a decrease in the number of Mac1 + Gr1 lo myeloid cells in the peripheral blood (fc = 0.54, p < 0.05) and spleen (fc = 0.51, p < 0.05) compared to Kras G12D/+ . We reasoned that the amelioration of the MPN phenotype in AEK FL recipients might be due to disease propagating HSCs being functionally compromised by both mutations in combination. Numbers of phenotypic donor HSCs (CD45.2 Lin - Sca1 + cKit + Flt3 - CD150 + ) were increased in Aml1 ETO/+ FL recipients compared to WT (fc = 5.17, p < 0.0001) and were normal in recipients of Kras G12D/+ FL. In comparison with Aml1 ETO/+ FL recipients, numbers of HSCs were markedly reduced in AEK FL recipients (fc = 0.30, p < 0.0001) supporting the idea that Kras G12D/+ has a specific detrimental effect on Aml1 ETO/+ HSCs. Secondary transplantation revealed an increase in myeloid reconstitution (fc = 3.37, p < 0.01) and HSC number (fc = 9.64, p < 0.05) in Aml1 ETO/+ mice compared to WT. In contrast, BM from primary recipients of Kras G12D/+ or AEK FL showeda lack of engraftment in secondary recipients and markedly reduced HSC number. These results indicate that in the absence of a signaling pathway mutation, Aml1 ETO/+ confers a clonal advantage to HSCs. However, Kras G12D/+ has a marked detrimental effect on Aml1 ETO/+ expressing pre-leukemic HSCs leading to a clonal disadvantage due to loss of phenotypic and functional HSCs. RNA-sequencing of WT, Aml1 ETO/+ , Kras G12D/+ and AEK HSCs revealed an enrichment for E2f (p < 0.01) and Myc (p < 0.01) targets in AEK HSCs compared to Aml1 ETO/+ HSCs, indicating an increase in cell cycle activation. This was confirmed by flow cytometry as we found a marked decrease in AEK HSCs in G0 compared to Aml1 ETO/+ (fc = 0.16, p < 0.001). Several candidate genes have been identified, including Gzmb (log 2 FC = -2.21, p < 0.0001) and Gja1 (log 2 FC = -3.65, p < 0.0001) which were both down-regulated in Aml1 ETO/+ , but up-regulated in AEK HSCs ( Gzmb log 2 FC = 0.96, p < 0.0001; Gja1 log 2 FC = 2.76, p < 0.0001). Knock-outs of Gzmb and Gja1 have been shown to increase HSC reconstitution (PMID 24752302) and cause an expansion of the Lin - Sca1 + cKit + compartment (PMID 16531325) respectively, indicating a potential role of the down-regulation of these genes for pre-leukemic HSC expansion. Our data provides evidence that Kras G12D/+ has a marked detrimental impact on Aml1 ETO/+ pre-leukemic HSCs, associated with distinct transcriptional signatures, helping to explain why signaling mutations such as KRAS mutations are not observed within pre-leukemic HSCs in AML patients.
