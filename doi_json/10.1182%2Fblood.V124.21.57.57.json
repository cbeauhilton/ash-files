    "abstract_text": "Prior work has shown that NOTCH1 is a prominent oncogene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) with activating NOTCH1 mutations occurring in over 50% of cases (Weng et al, Science 2004) and loss-of-function mutations in its negative regulator FBXW7 occurring in 8-15% of cases (O\u2019Neil et al, J Exp Med 2007; Thompson et al, J Exp Med 2007). Subsequent work has shown that continued Notch signaling is required for maintenance of T-ALL leukemia stem cells (Armstrong et al, Blood 2009; Tatarek et al, Blood 2011; Giambra et al, Nat Med 2012). Several lines of evidence have substantiated genetic interactions between the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways in various contexts, and Wnt signaling has been shown to play important roles in hematopoietic stem cell biology and also in hematopoietic cancers such as acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (reviewed in Luis et al, Leukemia 2012). To address what role if any Wnt signaling may play in T-ALL, we generated primary murine leukemias by viral transduction of bone marrow progenitors with activated NOTCH1, then delivered a fluorescent Wnt reporter construct (7TGP; Fuerer & Nusse, PLoS ONE 2010) by lentiviral transduction, and retransplanted the leukemias to interrogate Wnt signaling activity in vivo . We report here that active Wnt signaling is restricted to minor subpopulations within bulk T-ALL tumors, and that these Wnt-active subsets are highly enriched for leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) activity. Moreover, using Ctnnb1 loxP/loxP animals we show that inducible Cre-mediated deletion of \u03b2-catenin or enforced expression of a dominant-negative TCF construct severely compromises LIC activity. We also show that \u03b2-catenin levels are upregulated by hypoxia through Hif1a stabilization, and that deletion of Hif1a also severely compromises LIC activity. Interestingly, Wnt-active subsets are distributed diffusely throughout the marrow interstitial space suggesting that tumor infiltration induces formation of local hypoxic niches as opposed to taking up residence in pre-existing anatomic compartments with low oxygen tensions. Taken together, these results suggest a model in which hypoxic niches in vivo facilitate Hif1a-dependent accumulation of \u03b2-catenin which drives Wnt signaling and self-renewal of leukemia stem cells. Finally, we show using patient-derived xenografts that antagonism of Hif1a or Wnt signaling also compromises human LIC activity, suggesting that pharmacologic targeting of these pathways could have therapeutic application in patients with T-ALL.
