    "abstract_text": "CD34 \u2212 lineage \u2212 cells encompass an average 0.16% of human umbilical cord blood (UCB) mononuclear cells. We have previously shown that IL-15 promotes the stromal cell-dependent differentiation of UCB CD34 \u2212 lineage \u2212 cells into bipotent T/NK progenitor cells. IL-21, a CD4 + T-cell-derived IL-2 receptor \u03b3-chain signalling cytokine, is a crucial regulator of NK cell development and function. IL-21 increases the generation of mature NK cells from CD34 + haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in combination with IL-15, IL-7, SCF and Flt3 ligand. To date, it has not been established whether IL-21 might replace the stromal cell requirements and synergise with IL-15 in the induction of NK cell differentiation of CD34 \u2212 lineage \u2212 cells. In the present study, highly purified CD34 \u2212 lineage \u2212 cells from human UCB were cultured in medium containing IL-15, SCF and Flt3 ligand, either in the absence or presence of IL-21. Cells were analysed at different time intervals for surface expression of NK cell-associated antigens (CD56, CD16, NKG2A/CD94 inhibitory receptor, CD244 and NKG2D activating receptors, killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors, NKp46 triggering receptor), mRNA signals for NK-specific transcription factors (inhibitor of DNA binding protein 2 or ID2) and bcl-2 family members, T-cell-receptor (TCR)\u03b3 rearrangement status, IFN-\u03b3 release, and lytic activity against NK-sensitive tumour targets. On day +30 of culture in the presence of IL-15 and IL-21, CD34 \u2212 lineage \u2212 cells were expanded by 35-fold on average, compared with 21-fold in cultures nurtured with IL-15 alone. IL-21 per se was incapable of activating the proliferation of CD34 \u2212 lineage \u2212 cells or promote the emergence of NK cell-associated surface markers (see below). After 30 days of culture in the presence of IL-21, 80\u201390% of the developing NK cells exhibited a CD56 bright CD16 neg phenotype. Consistent with the antigen expression profile previously assigned to pseudomature NK cells, IL-21-differentiated NK cells ( IL-21 NKs) stained negatively for killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (CD158a and CD158b). Whereas NKG2A/CD94 expression on IL-21 NKs mirrored that on IL-15-differentiated NK cells, NKG2D could be detected on an average 65% of IL-21 NKs compared with 10% of cells maintained with IL-15. In sharp contrast to IL-15 alone, the combination of IL-21 and IL-15 markedly up-regulated mRNA signals for bcl-2, bcl-x L , TGF-\u03b2, GATA-3 and, perhaps more importantly, ID2, a master switch required for NK-cell development. At variance with IL-15-differentiated NK cells, IL-21 NKs harboured unrearranged TCR\u03b3 genes, secreted copious amounts of IFN-\u03b3 in culture supernatants and were capable of lysing NK-sensitive tumour cell targets after pre-activation with exogenous IL-2.

IL-21 might represent a valuable strategy to expand lytic NK cells from UCB CD34 \u2212 lineage \u2212 cells for immunotherapy purposes.",
