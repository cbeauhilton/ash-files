    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3559 Introduction. Myeloablative high dose chemotherapy (HDT) followed by single autologous stem cell transplantation is currently the standard treatment for patients younger than 65 years in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM). Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HDT with standard dose therapy (SDT) have shown some benefit in overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS), whereas other RCTs did not confirm this finding. Koreth et al. (2007) performed a metaanalysis summarizing the existing data of the RCTs including 2,411 patients. These authors found a significant superiority for HDT in PFS but not in OS. Since a number of new studies have been published recently, we attempted to re-analyze the current data in terms of the endpoints OS and PFS. Methods. We searched PubMed, Embase, abstracts of former ASH meetings and ClinicalTrials.gov as well as bibliographies of included trials and recent reviews from september 2009 until may, 20 th 2010. Amongst the 3,484 results in this search we identified 10 RCTs comparing HDT with SDT on an intent-to-treat-basis. Treatment characeristics and outcomes of OS and PFS were calculated using R. Furthermore, we tested for statistical heterogenity, publication bias and performed subgroup analyses. Results. 9 RCTs including 2,600 patients were fully analyzed. Patients undergoing HDT with stem cell transplantation did have significant PFS benefit (Hazard Ratio 0.73; 95% conficence intervall 0.56\u20130.95; P=0.02) but not OS benefit (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.74\u20131.10; P=0.32) compared to patients undergoing SDT. Additional data from ongoing clinical trials are expected, thus updated results at the meeting including 10 RCTs with about 3,400 patients will be presented. Conclusion. Although there is only a trend to OS benefit with HDT, it is currently still the first line treatment. Additional data from ongoing clinical trials and new studies using novel agents like thalidomide, lenalidomide and bortezomib are egerly warrented to finally evaluate the role of HDT in the treatment management of patients with newly diagnosed MM.
