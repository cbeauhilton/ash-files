We describe clinical outcomes and treatment patterns from a prospective registry of pediatric and adult pts with SCD. Methods Pts \u22652 years old with HbSS, HbSC, or HbS/\u03b2-thalassemia were enrolled from 57 US centers and assessed every 6 months (mos) for up to 3 years. Differences between pediatric and adult pts at 24 mos follow-up are reported. (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01220115). Results A total of 498 pts completed the baseline visit (74.1% HbSS disease, 15.3% HbSC, and 10.4% HbS/\u03b2-thalassemia) (Table 1  Table 1.

ACS, acute chest syndrome ; SCD, sickle cell disease. View Large ). Prior to study, adults had higher frequencies of pain crises, strokes, and priapism, while pediatric pts had more frequent infections and acute chest syndrome (ACS)/pneumonia. On study, a similar proportion of pediatric and adult pts (56.4% overall) were hospitalized, most frequently due to pain, fever, and ACS/pneumonia; a greater proportion of pediatric pts were hospitalized due to fever ( P <0.05). The percentage of pts who received a transfusion and/or chelation while on study was similar between adult and pediatric pts. Almost half of the pediatric and adult groups received hydroxyurea prior to and during the study. High rates of absenteeism were observed, with 51% of pediatric pts and 44.4% of adults missing 1 to 10 days of school or work in the year before study. Conclusions Despite advances in care, SCD is associated with significant morbidity that contributes to high rates of hospitalization and absenteeism in both pediatric and adult pts. Continued follow-up in this registry will provide additional information about disease patterns and pt management.
