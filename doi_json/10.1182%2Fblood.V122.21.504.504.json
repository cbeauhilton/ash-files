    "abstract_text": "Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive and incurable variant of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that is confined to the central nervous system. Most PCNSL (90%) are part of the immune-privileged site-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Unlike nodal DLBCL, only a limited number of genetic studies have been performed in PCNSL, partly due to lack of available tissue specimens. Because of the fragmented knowledge of the genomic basis, it is still a matter of debate whether they differ from systemic DLBCL with respect to their molecular features and pathogenesis and also if there is a CNS specific signature. We performed a comprehensive genomic study in a cohort of 22 immunocompetent (HIV- and EBV-) PCNSL. DNA was extracted from FFPE tissues (N=15) and frozen tissue (N=7). Samples were analyzed using a combination of aCGH (N=18), exome sequencing (N=10), mate-pair genome sequencing (N=2) and targeted sequencing (N=8). We found a complex karyotype with a median of 21 copy-number abnormalities (range 10\u201347), 6 structural abnormalities, 6 frameshift indels and 67 nonsynonymous mutations. By integrating mutation and copy number data we found a group of genes recurrently mutated and/or deleted in PNCSL. Remarkable findings were the high prevalence of MYD88 activating mutations (L265P/M232T/V217F), found in 69% of cases and the biallelic loss of CDKN2A (60%). A subset of recurrent abnormalities was exclusively found in PCNSL, and not being previously identified in systemic DLBCL. Thus, 11% of PCNSL have biallelic inactivation of TOX (a regulator of T-cell development) and PRKCD (protein kinase C delta), while another 17% of cases show focal monoallelic deletions/mutations in these genes. Finally, recurrent mutations have been identified in ATM , which have not been found in nodal DLBCL. Several other genes affected have been previously identified in nodal DLBCL, such as biallelic loss of TNFAIP3 (16%), PRDM1 (16%), GNA13 , TMEM30A , B2M and CD58 (11% each), activating mutations of CD79B (28%) and CARD11 (19%) and translocations of BCL6 (22%). Components of the NF-kB pathways were altered in >90% of PNCSL. Pathway analysis also showed an enrichment of networks associated with immune response, proliferation, regulation of apoptosis and lymphocyte differentiation and activation. Finally, we searched for associations between genetic alterations and clinical outcome. We showed that deletions of 6q21 ( PRDM1 ) and 6q23 ( TNFAIP3 ) were both associated with shorter overall survival (p=0.007 and p=0.03, respectively). In summary, we report a genomic background in PCNSL similar to post-GC DLBCL but reinforcing the existence of a subset of abnormalities specific to PCNSL, suggesting their potential relevance in the disease pathogenesis. Additionally, the results obtained from FFPE samples are encouraging and larger archival tissue collections can now be analyzed in order to complement the still fragmented knowledge we have of the genetic basis of the disease.
