    "abstract_text": "Aim The objective of this study was to determine the in vivo distribution of dendritic cells (DC) when given to patients (pts) with Multiple Myeloma (MM) via varying routes of injection (intravenous- IV, intranodal- IN, intradermal-ID and subcutaneous-SC) by using ex vivo Indium 111 Oxine (In 111 , T 1/2 = 68h) labelled DC. Six (6) eligible pts had stable or slowly progressive MM not requiring systemic therapy with evidence of increased MUC-1 expression. Autologous monocytes were collected from each patient via apheresis and dendritic cells were produced by in vitro culture within the VacCell\u00aeprocessor. Method Cells were cultured for 7 days with GM-CSF and IL-13 on days 0 and 4 and after purification by counter-flow elutriation DC were pulsed with MUC1-Mannan fusion protein (24h) prior to use. DC were non-matured (imDC, n=3), or matured (mDC, n=3) with 1\u03bcg/ml FMKp and 500 UI/ml gamma IFN (6h) for subsequent In 111 labelling. Cells were labelled with In 111 (20 Mbq IV or 0.7 Mbq minimum each of IN, ID and SC) for 45\u201360 minutes in 0.9% NaCl with 5% autologous serum at room temperature, and washed twice before resuspension for administration. Pts received DC initially IV and then two weeks later by each of IN, SC, ID simultaneously. Pts at each DC administration were serially imaged using a planar gamma camera for up to 4 days. Results Mean DC labelling efficiency (based upon retained label in cells vs total label used) was 86% (54\u201395, n =12). Mean IV injection was 1.5 x 10 8 cells (0.33\u20132.5 x 10 8 , n = 6), and IN, SC, ID was 2.0 x 10 7 cells (1.3\u20133.6 x 10 7 , n = 6). IV: At 1 and 4h cells were predominantly visible in the lungs. After 24h -72h lungs were clearing with DC migrating to liver, spleen and later to bone marrow. ID and SC: imDC migrated to axillary LN in 1/3 ID and 1/3 SC injections whilst mDC tracked to LN in 2/3 ID injections and 3/3 SC injections. Quantitation of tracking was possible in 5/7 of the serial images. Table 1.

The arrow indicates injection site over the right deltoid in the raised arm (shown as outline) with subsequent progressive accumulation of cells into afferent axillary LN. Conclusion ID and SC images suggest mDC track more consistently to LN, whilst IV mDC cleared more slowly from lungs at 24h compared to imDC. Figure 1.
