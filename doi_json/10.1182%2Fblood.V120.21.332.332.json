    "abstract_text": "Abstract 332 Background: The high response rates seen with the bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRD/RVD) regimen (Kumar S, et al. Blood 2012; Richardson PG, et al. Blood 2010) highlight the feasibility of combining a proteasome inhibitor with an immunomodulatory agent and a steroid in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma (MM). MLN9708 is an investigational, oral, reversible proteasome inhibitor with promising anti-MM effects and favorable toxicity profile with low rates of peripheral neuropathy (PN). Here we report phase (Ph) 1 and preliminary Ph 2 results of the first study of MLN9708 in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with previously untreated MM ( NCT01217957 ). Methods: Patients aged \u226518 yrs with measurable disease, ECOG performance status 0\u20132, and no grade \u22652 PN, received oral MLN9708 (days 1, 8, and 15) plus lenalidomide 25 mg (days 1\u201321) and dexamethasone 40 mg (days 1, 8, 15, 22) for up to twelve 28-day cycles, then maintenance therapy with MLN9708 (same schedule) every 28 days until progression. Patients could undergo stem cell collection after 3 cycles and discontinue for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) after 6 cycles. In Ph 1, dose escalation (1.68\u20133.95 mg/m 2 ) proceeded using a standard 3+3 design, based on cycle 1 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Ph 1 primary objectives were determination of safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended Ph 2 dose (RP2D); the Ph 2 primary objective was CR+VGPR rate. Secondary and exploratory objectives included characterization of MLN9708 pharmacokinetics (PK) and measurement of minimal residual disease using multiparameter flow cytometry. Responses were assessed by IMWG criteria. Adverse events (AEs) were graded by NCI-CTCAE v4.02. Results: From 22 November 2010 (Ph 1) and 14 October 2011 (Ph 2) to data cut-off (June 27, 2012), 65 patients (36 male) have been enrolled, 15 in Ph 1 and 50 in Ph 2. Median age was 66 yrs (range 34\u201386); 43% and 13% had ISS stage II and III. Patients have received a median of 5 cycles (range 1\u201315) \u2013 6 cycles (range 1\u201315) in Ph 1 and 5 cycles (range 1\u20138) in Ph 2. 42 (65%) patients remain on treatment, 4 (27%) in Ph 1 and 38 (76%) in Ph 2. At 10 August 2012, 22 patients have discontinued: 16 to receive ASCT, 4 due to AEs (3 drug-related, 1 not drug-related GI bleed), 2 for other reasons (1 disease progression, 1 due to investigator decision). Of those who have undergone stem cell mobilization, a median yield of 9.1 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/L was reported. MLN9708 MTD was established as 2.97 mg/m 2 and RP2D was selected as 2.23 mg/m 2 ; RP2D converts to a 4.0 mg fixed dose based on population PK results. At 27 June, all-grade AEs related to any regimen drug and seen in \u226525% of patients were fatigue (32%), nausea (31%), and vomiting (25%). Grade 3 any-drug-related AEs were reported in 26 (40%) patients, including erythematous rash, nausea and vomiting (5% each). Grade 4 any-drug-related AEs were end-stage renal disease (related to progressing MM) and deep vein thrombosis in 1 patient each. One patient experienced grade 3 PN at the RP2D. At 10 August, 3 patients discontinued due to drug-related AEs \u2013 1 in Ph 2 who stopped due to grade 1 resting tremor, grade 2 occasional memory loss (neurologic work-up was negative), and grade 2 peripheral sensory neuropathy, 1 patient in Ph 2 due to drug-related RSV pneumonia who subsequently died on study due to this AE, and 1 patient in Ph 1 with syncope (a DLT). Among all 65 patients (at 10 August), median patient follow-up was 3.88 months (Ph 1: 9.03 months, Ph 2: 3.68 months). The overall response rate (ORR; \u2265PR, confirmed/unconfirmed) was 88% (100% in Ph 1 and 84% in Ph 2); this includes 40% \u2265VGPR (53% in Ph 1 and 36% in Ph 2) and 18% CR (33% in Ph 1 and 14% in Ph 2). Median cycle number is limited, but 50 patients have received \u22654 cycles: ORR was 96%, with 44% \u2265VGPR and 26% CR. Analyses by cytogenetic status will be presented at the meeting. At data cut-off, 50 of 52 responders remained in response, with responses durable for up to 13.2+ months. Median time to first response was 0.92 months (range 0.89\u20136.44). Conclusions: The combination of weekly oral MLN9708 plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone appears generally well tolerated, with one grade 3 PN at the RP2D. Preliminary data show antitumor activity at the RP2D in patients with previously untreated MM, and at data cut-off, 96% of patients had achieved \u2265PR, including a \u2265VGPR rate of 44% and a CR rate of 26%, with responses consistent with those reported with VRD/RVD.
