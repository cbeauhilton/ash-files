    "abstract_text": "Background: Newly drugs access for MM treatment still a challenge in some countries. One of the most available inductions for TE NDMM patients (pts) worldwide is cyclophosphamide (C), thalidomide (T) and dexamethasone (d)-(CTd). Dara the first anti- CD38, had been combined with VCd, VTd and VRd and markedly increased the depth and duration of the response. We hypothesized that Dara and CTd combination could be safe and allow deeper activity as an alternative protocol. Aims: The aims of this analysis were to evaluate Progression Free Survival (PFS) of Dara-CTd treatment and minimal residual disease (MRD) after one year of Dara maintenance. Primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the VGPR after two consolidation cycles post-autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Methods: This is a phase II, open-label single-center clinical trial. The main inclusion criteria were: TE NDMM, creatinine clearance > 30 ml/min, normal cardiac, renal and liver function and the Easter Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status = 0 - 2. The protocol was Dara-CTd for up to four 28-day induction cycles: C-500mg oral (PO) on days 1,8 and 15, T at 100-200mg PO on days 1 to 28, (d) at 40mg PO on days 1,8,15 and 22 and Dara at 16mg/Kg/dose intravenous (IV) on days 1,8,15 and 22 during cycles 1 - 2 and every other week in cycles 3 - 4, followed by ASCT. All pts received up to four 28-day consolidation cycles that was started at D+30 after ASCT: Dara at 16mg/Kg and (d) at 40mg every other week, associated with T at 100mg PO on days 1 - 28. Dara at 16mg/Kg was used monthly as maintenance until progression or limiting toxicity. G-CSF was used for stem cell (SC) mobilization and plerixafor had been allowed whenever the pts need. The MRD was evaluated by next-generation flow (NGF) based and PET-CT was performed when the patient obtained NGF negativity or finished consolidation. PFS outcome was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. All pts received antiviral, anti-pneumocystis and anti-thrombotic prophylaxis. Data cut-off was June 15, 2021. Results: The first pts was enrolled in November 2018. A total of 24 pts were included, the median age being 60 (range 37- 67 years), 23 (92%) were non-white, 5 (21%) had an R-ISS = 1, 12 (54%) had an R-ISS = 2 and 4 (16%), an R-ISS = 3. Six (25%) pts had high-risk chromosomal abnormalities [del17p, t(4;14) or t(14;16)]. To date, all pts have completed induction, 20 have received transplant and 17 have completed D+90 post-transplant assessment. No SC mobilization failure was observed, and six (30%) pts needed plerixafor use. By ITT analysis after a median follow up of 20 months the PFS at 12 and 18 months was 86%. No PFS difference was observed between different subgroups. Regarding response rates, after the end of induction (cycle 4), 19 (90%) of the pts obtained > PR and 8 (38%) obtained >VGPR, including three MRD negativity by NGF. 17 pts have completed two consolidation cycles after transplant and 94% obtained > VGPR as best response, 13 (76%) obtained MRD negativity by NGF and 10 (58%) had negative PET-CT. Seven (41%) pts had both flow and PET-CT negativity. Six pts completed one year of maintenance and five of them (83%) still MRD negativity by NGF. Four pts died from infection, two of them related with covid infection (one before transplant and one during maintenance). Another case post-transplant, considered not related to the investigational agent and one after consolidation, related to the investigational agent. Two pts have discontinued treatment due to progression - 1 before ASCT e 1 during maintenance. The most common adverse events (AEs) grades 3 and 4 were neutropenia (n = 12), infusion reaction (n = 7), neuropathy (n = 6), lymphopenia (n = 4), infection (n = 3), hypertension (n = 1) and rash (n = 1). Summary/Conclusion: The Daratumumab - CTd protocol is an active regimen capable of producing deep and sustainable responses and improve the PFS of NDMM TE pts with a favorable safety profile.
