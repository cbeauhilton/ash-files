    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4440 Bosutinib (BOS) is an orally active, dual Src/Abl competitive inhibitor that has demonstrated clinical activity and a manageable tolerability profile across treatment settings in patients (pts) with Philadelphia chromosome\u2013positive (Ph+) leukemia. The current analysis compared the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of BOS 500 mg/day between Asian and non-Asian pts with Ph+ leukemia. In an open-label phase I/II trial of pts with previously treated Ph+ leukemia, 570 pts with chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase, and blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia following development of resistance/intolerance to imatinib and possibly dasatinib and/or nilotinib received BOS, including 114 Asian and 456 non-Asian pts. In a phase III trial comparing BOS versus imatinib in pts with newly diagnosed (\u22646 months) CP CML, 250 pts received BOS, including 65 Asian and 185 non-Asian pts. Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics were generally similar between Asian and non-Asian pts, although Asian pts were more likely to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0 (phase I/II, 88% [Asian] vs 61% [non-Asian]; phase III, 95% vs 67%). The most common reasons for treatment discontinuation in both studies were an AE (phase I/II, 15% [Asian] vs 24% [non-Asian]; phase III, 28% vs 24%) and disease progression (phase I/II, 22% each; phase III, 5% each). Median BOS apparent clearance (CL/F) in the phase I/II trial was 101.2 L/h (range, 28.1\u2013450.9 L/h) in Asian pts and 122.3 L/h (range, 26.6\u20131,561.9 L/h) in non-Asian pts, and in the phase III trial was 105.2 L/h (range, 20.1\u2013274.3 L/h) in Asian pts and 126.7 L/h (range, 29.3\u2013638.2 L/h) in non-Asian pts. Overall, gastrointestinal events were the most common non-hematologic treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported with BOS. Diarrhea, rash, and pyrexia were reported more frequently among Asian versus non-Asian pts in both studies ( Table ). Regardless of race, diarrhea events were typically low-grade, occurred early (median time to diarrhea, 2\u20134 days), and were transient (median event duration, 1\u20133 days). Rash was also typically low-grade and transient (median event duration, 9\u201327 days). In contrast, nausea was reported more frequently among non-Asian pts. Other TEAEs were similar between Asian and non-Asian pts or showed no consistent pattern between studies ( Table ). Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities were similar between Asian and non-Asian pts for elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT; phase I/II, 11% vs 8%; phase III, 26% vs 22%) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST; phase I/II, 3% vs 4%; phase III, 12% vs 11%). Among grade 3/4 hematologic laboratory abnormalities, thrombocytopenia was more frequent among Asian versus non-Asian pts in both studies (phase I/II, 41% vs 33%; phase III, 22% vs 11%); anemia was also more common among Asian pts in the phase I/II study (30% vs 16%), but not the phase III study (8% each). Grade 3/4 neutropenia was similar within both studies (phase I/II, 25% vs 24%; phase III, 11% vs 10%). BOS dose modifications due to adverse events (AEs) were similar between Asian and non-Asian pts in the phase I/II trial but more common among Asian pts in the phase III trial ( Table ). No clear pattern of treatment discontinuations due to AEs was observed. Few deaths due to AEs were reported for either Asian or non-Asian pts during BOS treatment or within 1 month after the last BOS dose. Across studies, BOS CL/F in Asians pts was within the range of CL/F in non-Asian pts, and minor differences in the tolerability profile of BOS were noted. However, BOS 500 mg/day was associated with an overall manageable toxicity profile regardless of race.  Event, % . Phase I/II study . Phase III study . Asian (n = 114) . Non-Asian (n = 456) .
