    "abstract_text": "Emergence of resistance to Imatinib complicates the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Second-generation Bcr-Abl inhibitors are capable to overcome resistance mediated by most mutations except T315I. As this mutation is causative for \u223c20% of clinically observed resistances, the need for novel treatment strategies becomes obvious. Here, we report on a novel kinase inhibitor PHA-680626 exhibiting strong inhibitory activity on both Bcr-Abl and Aurora kinases. Significant anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects were observed in human BCR-ABL positive cell lines and murine BaF3 cells ectopically expressing wt BCR-ABL or the Imatinib resistant BCR-ABL mutants M351T, E255K and T315I. Treatment with PHA-680626 decreased phosphorylation of CrkL and histone H3. As CrkL represents a typical down-stream target of Bcr-Abl while histone H3 phosphorylation is an indicator for Aurora kinase B activity, these findings indicate that effects of PHA-680626 are mediated via inhibition of both pathways. Moreover, high antiproliferative activity of PHA-680626 was observed in primary CD34+ cells derived from CML patients at diagnosis or in blast crisis as well as from an individual harbouring the T315I mutation. Thus, both Bcr-Abl and Aurora kinase inhibition contribute to the efficacy of PHA-680626 against Imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL positive leukemias, particularly those harbouring the T315I mutation.",
