    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Relapsed/refractory B-cell NHL remains an area of significant medical need. CD19 is broadly expressed on B-cell malignancies making it an ideal target for antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) based therapy. Coltuximab ravtansine is a CD19-targeting ADC consisting of a CD19-targeting antibody conjugated to the maytansinoid anti-mitotic DM4. In preclinical studies, coltuximab ravtansine has shown potent, targeted activity against NHL cell lines and xenograft models. In early clinical trials, it has been well tolerated and has shown promising signs of efficacy as both a single agent and in combination with rituximab. In the STARLYTE Phase 2 trial coltuximab ravtansine monotherapy resulted in an ORR of 44% in R/R-DLBCL that included an ORR of 21% in hard-to-treat primary refractory patients (NCT01472887). Here we describe studies aimed at the identification of combination partners for coltuximab ravtansine to further optimize clinical benefit to R/R-NHL patients. We are employing a dual approach where we investigate combination of coltuximab ravtansine with multiple, novel targeted therapy partners whilst in parallel also investigating the combination of coltuximab ravtansine with chemotherapies commonly used in the late stage R/R-NHL setting. Methods: Coltuximab ravtansine and the DM4 payload were evaluated in a high throughput screen both as single agents and in combination with a selection of novel, emerging targeted agents across a panel of twenty NHL cell lines. The combinations were evaluated in a dose-response matrix and a statistical method was used to identify combination synergies significantly superseding baseline additivity values. The in vivo efficacy of coltuximab ravtansine was additionally assessed in combination with various clinically relevant chemotherapy agents in subcutaneous xenograft models of NHL. Results: Coltuximab ravtansine and DM4 both showed potent single agent activity against the entire panel of NHL cell lines with median GI50's of 770pM and 100pM, respectively. We observed a significant correlation in the cell line sensitivity of the two compounds suggesting that sensitivity to coltuximab ravtansine is driven, at least in part, by inherent sensitivity of cells to the cytotoxic effects of the DM4 payload. In vitro combination studies for coltuximab ravtansine were performed to identify targets or pathways that result in the most prominent combination effects across the cell line panel. Analysis of the in vitro combination dose-matrix revealed particularly strong synergy between coltuximab ravtansine and various inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis. Studies to examine the synergism between coltuximab ravtansine and PI3K inhibitors in in vivo models of NHL are ongoing. In order to further determine the utility of coltuximab ravtansine as part of a potential combination regimen for the treatment of R/R-NHL, we assessed the combination of coltuximab ravtansine with the chemotherapy agents bendamustine and gemcitabine in vivo . As gemcitabine is typically used in combination we assessed the efficacy of a coltuximab ravtansine with rituximab and gemcitabine in vivo . In both cases the combination with coltuximab ravtansine was significantly more efficacious than the standard-of-care alone arms. Conclusions: Coltuximab ravtansine demonstrates synergistic activity in combination with multiple PI3K pathway inhibitors across a large panel of NHL cell lines. Additionally, we have shown that combination of coltuximab ravtansine with clinically relevant late stage treatments such as bendamustine and rituximab + gemcitabine is more efficacious than the chemotherapy regimens alone. These results support the continued development of coltuximab ravtansine in R/R-NHL in combination with chemotherapy regimens and suggest that a combination of coltuximab ravtansine with PI3K inhibitors may also be of interest in the clinical setting.
