    "abstract_text": "Splicing factors (SFs) are among the most frequent mutational targets in myeloid neoplasms, particularly in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and a subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), designated as 'chromatin/spliceosome-mutated AML, where major SFs mutated include SF3B1 , SRSF2 , U2AF1 , and ZRSR2 . These SF mutations are largely mutually exclusive and except for ZRSR2 mutations, are invariably heterozygous, showing prominent hotspots, suggesting that mutations have neomorphic functions and might cause a synthetic lethality when they are homozygous or two SFs are mutated. Thus, SF functions might be a plausible target of therapy for MDS/AML. Of potential interest in this regard is serine/arginine-rich (SR) domains ubiquitously shared by many SFs, including U2AF1, SRSF2, and ZRSR2, which need to be phosphorylated for their nuclear translocation by evolutionally conserved kinases, known as CLK family of proteins. CLK family kinases regulate mRNA splicing by phosphorylating various SR proteins, and inhibition of CLK family kinases resulted in reduction of phosphorylation levels of SR proteins, induction of splicing alterations and protein depletion for multiple genes, including those involved in growth and survival pathways such as S6K, EGFR, EIF3D, and PARP. In addition, a recent report showed that CLK inhibition can induce skipped exons, cell death, and cell growth suppression, which are dependent of CLK2 expression levels. Thus, CLK family kinases are possible targets of inhibition by small molecules to induce synthetic lethality in SF-mutated MDS/AML and for this purpose, we have recently developed an orally available and highly potent CLK inhibitor, CTX-712 and evaluated its anti-leukemic activities both in vitro and in vivo . When tested in human myeloid cell lines (K562 and THP1), CTX-712, strongly inhibited phosphorylation of multiple SR proteins including SRSF3, SRSF4, SRSF5, and SRSF6 that bind to SRSF2. To further investigate the efficacy of CTX-712 in vivo , we established 5 AML-derived xenograft (PDX) models, which treated with varying doses of CTX-712. Among these 5 PDX models, SRSF2 mutation was found in only one case, which had a SRSF2 p.P95H, mutation, while others (a subcutaneous and 3 leukemia model) were negative for SRSF2 mutations. The SRSF2 -mutated model showed a significant response to CTX-712 in a dose-dependent manner. Of note, 4 out of 5 mice treated using a high dose protocol (12.5 mg/kg) achieved complete remission (the tumor shrank completely to unmeasurable size). Two-week after treatment, tumor volumes (mm 3 ) were 762 \u00b1 147 (vehicle), 331 \u00b1 64 (low dose of CTX-712: 6.25mg/kg, P =0.028), and 39 \u00b1 39 (high dose, P =0.0014) (N=5 each, mean \u00b1 SEM). CTX-712 also significantly improved the survival of PDX #1. Median survivals (days after engraftment) were 34.5 (vehicle) vs . 93.5 (12.5mg/kg, P =0.015) (N=2 each). Interestingly, another leukemic model carrying KRAS , NF1 , and TP53 but not SRSF2 mutations also showed a significant reduction of leukemic burden 2 weeks after CTX-712 treatment; leukemic burden after therapy, as measured by frequency of hCD45+cells in PB (%), were 82 \u00b1 2.2 (vehicle), 17 \u00b1 3.6 (low dose, P <0.0001), and 0.89 \u00b1 0.43 (complete remission, high dose, P <0.0001), (N=4 each, mean \u00b1 SEM). In the third PDX model with mutations of FLT3 , RAD21 , RUNX1 , and WT1 , CTX-712 administration reduced subcutaneous AML tumors in a dose-dependent manner and achieved partial remission (high dose, P =0.0008) (N=6 each). CTX-712 also significantly improved the survival of the PDX #3 model (high dose, P =0.0069) (N=6 each). In PDX #4, leukemic model with mutations of ASXL1 , BCOR , and TET2 , high dose CTX-712 therapy strongly reduced the leukemic cell burden than vehicle control ( P =0.0027), (N=4 each). CTX-712 also significantly improved the survival of this model ( P =0.016) (N=5 each). The last AML PDX #5 model with U2AF1 , BCOR , DNMT3A , IDH1 , KDM6A , RUNX1 , and TET2 mutations was refractory for CTX-712 therapy. Overall, 4 out of 5 PDX AML models showed anti-tumor effect of CTX-712. Complete disappearances of tumors were obtained in 2 cases, including an SRSF2 -mutated model. These results provide mechanistic insights of CLK inhibition and a rationale for further investigation of the novel CLK inhibitor in MDS/AML. CTX-712 is currently in clinical phase 1 trials for relapsed and refractory malignancies. Disclosures Yoda: Chordia Therapeutics Inc.: Research Funding.
