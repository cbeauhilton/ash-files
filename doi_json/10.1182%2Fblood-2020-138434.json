    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The standard approach for relapsed or refractory (RR) classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) following front-line treatment failure is second line therapy (SLT) aimed to achieve complete response (CR), followed by consolidation with high dose therapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HDT/AHCT). No one standard SLT exists and options include regimens containing platinum, gemcitabine, and more recently brentuximab vedotin (BV). Complete response rates associated with these regimens range from 50-70%. Due to the increasing use of BV in the front-line setting, development of SLT regimens that are both highly effective and BV-sparing are needed. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors are highly active in RR cHL and have the potential to enhance the efficacy of standard chemotherapy. Here we report the results of our phase II study evaluating a novel anti-PD-1-based regimen, pembrolizumab plus gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and liposomal doxorubicin (pembrolizumab-GVD), as SLT for RR cHL. Methods: Transplant eligible patients (pts) with RR cHL following failure of 1-line of therapy were eligible. Treatment consisted of 2 to 4 cycles of pembrolizumab (200mg IV, day 1), gemcitabine (1000mg/m2 IV, days 1 and 8), vinorelbine (20mg/m2 IV, days 1 and 8) and liposomal doxorubicin (15mg/m2, days 1 and 8), given on 21-day cycles. Pts who achieved CR by PET (Deauville \u22643) after 2 or 4 cycles proceeded to HDT/AHCT. HDT/AHCT was carried out according to institutional standards and BV maintenance was allowed following HDT/AHCT. The primary endpoint was CR rate after 2 or 4 cycles of pembrolizumab-GVD. Enrollment occurred according to a Simon 2-stage design with sample size based upon a projected CR rate of 70%. In stage 1, 23 pts enrolled and 12 or more CRs were required to proceed to stage II; in stage II, an additional 16 pts enrolled. Out of a total of 39 pts, 24 CRs were required to declare this regimen promising. Results: Among 39 patients enrolled, 37 are evaluable for toxicity (2 pts have not yet started treatment) and 34 are evaluable for response (4 pts too early, 1 pt found to have composite lymphoma after enrollment). Of 37 treated pts, median age is 36 (range 21-71), 43% are male, 23 (62%) had advanced stage disease, and 15 (41%) had primary refractory disease. With regard to RR cHL risk factors (B-symptoms, extranodal disease, and relapse/refractory disease within 1 year of initial treatment), 4(11%) had no risk factors (RFs), 21 (57%) had 1 RF, 9 (24%) had 2 RFs, and 3 (8%) had all 3 RFs. Treatment was well tolerated with most adverse events being grade 1 or 2 (see figure 1). Grade 3 AEs included rash (n=1), elevated AST/ALT (n=3), oral mucositis (n=2), and neutropenia (n=3). Figure 2 shows the outcome for all 37 treated pts. Among 34 evaluable pts, 31 (91%) achieved CR after 2 cycles and 3 achieved partial response. An additional 1 pt achieved CR after 4 cycles of pembrolizumab-GVD, therefore in total, 32 of 34 (94%) achieved CR following pembrolizumab-GVD. 4 pts with CR after 2 cycles received an additional 2 cycles of pembrolizumab-GVD in order to delay HDT/AHCT during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic (n=3) or due to refusing HDT/ASCT (n=1). To date, 32 have undergone HDT/AHCT following 2 (n=27) or 4 (n=5) cycles of treatment. 1 pt is awaiting HDT/AHCT; 1 pt refused HDT/ASCT and received pembrolizumab maintenance instead. 2 pts received involved site radiation therapy to initial area of relapsed disease prior to planned HDT/AHCT and 10 pts received post-HDT/ASCT maintenance with BV. Median follow-up post-HDT/AHCT is 9 mos (range 0.03-20.9 mos) and all pts remain in remission to date. Conclusion: Second-line therapy with pembrolizumab-GVD is a highly effective and well-tolerated regimen that can efficiently bridge pts with RR cHL to HDT/AHCT. Updated results including all 39 enrolled pts will be presented at the meeting. Given the high CR rate observed with pembrolizumab-GVD, an expansion cohort evaluating 8 cycles of pembrolizumab maintenance (instead of HDT/AHCT) for patients who achieve CR after 4 cycles of pembrolizumab-GVD is planned.
