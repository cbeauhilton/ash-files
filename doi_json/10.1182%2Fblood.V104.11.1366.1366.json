    "abstract_text": "A recently described dimorphism at position 559 of FCGR3A gene results in two allotypes of Fc\u03b3 receptor IIIa (Fc\u03b3 RIIIa) with phenylalanine (F) or valine (V) at amino acid position 158. It has been shown that Fc\u03b3 RIIIa-VV homozygous patients with follicular lymphoma respond better to Rituximab as a single agent than F carriers. However, there is evidence that this disadvantage in F carriers can be overcome by higher Rituximab concentrations or by the use of defucosylated therapeutic antibodies. Therefore rapid, widely applicable, and cost-effective methods for the determination of this Fc\u03b3 RIIIa dimorphism are necessary. Currently available methods to determine this dimorphism are based on PCR techniques. To simplify the determination of Fc\u03b3 RIIIa-V/F dimorphism we developed a novel flow cytometric approach using known differences in epitope recognition of monoclonal antibodies (moabs) to Fc\u03b3 RIIIa. The moab MEM-154 recognizes Fc\u03b3 RIIIa-V only, whereas moab 3G8 recognizes Fc\u03b3 RIIIa irrespective of the dimorphism. We determined the expression level of epitopes recognized by 3G8 and MEM-154 in NK cells of 35 healthy donors (FF 14; V/F 17; VV 4) by three color flow cytometry and secondary immunofluorescence. Results were compared to genotypes determined by a TaqMan assay using allele specific fluorochrome labelled probes. Donors genotyped as Fc\u03b3 RIIIa FF, V/F, and VV demonstrated overlapping immunofluorescence levels detected by both 3G8 and MEM-154. However, the ratio of fluorescence measured using MEM-154 divided by the immunofluorescence measured using 3G8 was 100% accurate for predicting genotypes. Ratios below 0.05 were measured in Fc\u03b3 RIIIa FF individuals, ratios between 0.1 and 0.5 were measured in heterozygotes, whereas ratios higher than 0.6 were found in Fc\u03b3 RIIIa VV individuals only. Quantitative flow cytometry demonstrated a great variation in Fc\u03b3 RIIIa expression on NK cells between individuals with identical Fc\u03b3 R IIIa genotype explaining the failure to predict the genotype by a single Fc\u03b3 R IIIa moab only. This novel flow cytometric assay is cost-efficient, easy to implement, reliable and uses standard flow cytometric techniques. Compared to known methods to determine the dimorphism it is faster and applicable in laboratories without sophisticated PCR technology."
