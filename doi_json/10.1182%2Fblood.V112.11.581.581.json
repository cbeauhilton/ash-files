    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in younger patients (pts) is still a challenge, with questions about best induction regimen before autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and impact of Rituximab. We report here the final results with extended follow-up of a prospective phase II trial. Methods : Patients under 66 years with histologically proven, stage III-IV, MCL were included. Treatment consisted of three courses of CHOP with Rituximab at the third one and three courses of RDHAP. Peripheral blood stem cells harvest was performed and responding pts were eligible for an ASCT after high dose radio-chemotherapy with TAM6 (TBI 10 Gy, Aracytine 6 g/m\u00b2, Melphalan 140 mg/m\u00b2) or BEAM if TBI could not be performed. Results : From May 2000 to September 2003, 60 pts were included. Median age was 57 years. Characteristics of patients were as follow : bone marrow involvement 85%, leukemic disease 48%, gastrointestinal involvment 52%, PS>1 6%, LDH > 1N 38%. Overall response rate was high with 93% after (R)CHOP and 95% after RDHAP. Interestingly, CR was uncommon after (R)CHOP (12%), whereas high proportion of patients (61%) were in CR after RDHAP, suggesting higher efficacy of high dose AraC. Forty-nine pts were autografted (41 with TAM6) : all patients but two (96%) were in CR. With a median follow-up of 67 months, median EFS was 83 months and median OS was not reached. Five years OS was 75%. Neither toxic death nor unexpected toxicities were observed. The comparison with our previous French oligocentric study using the same regimen but without Rituximab (Lefrere, Hematologica 2007) suggests a better outcome when Rituximab is added (median EFS : 51 months). Conclusion : This study confirms that regimens containing Aracytine and Rituximab are safe and prolong survival and may even induce cure in MCL patients. Thus, they should be used in induction treatment before ASCT. This regimen is currently compared with the classical RCHOP induction in a multicentric European protocol within the EMCL network."
