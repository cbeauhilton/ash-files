    "abstract_text": "In order to reduce toxicity in elderly patients with newly diagnosed APL, since 3/1997 the Italian cooperative group GIMEMA evaluated an amended AIDA protocol for patients aged > 60 years, consisting of the same induction with ATRA and Idarubicin but only 1st consolidation course (Idarubicin + Cytarabine), followed by 2 years maintenance with ATRA alone. Up to now, 56 patients (25 males and 31 females, median age 66.2 years, 46 with PS 0-1 and 10 with PS 2) are fully evaluable. At onset, according to GIMEMA-PETHEMA risk score, 18 were low-risk(32.5%), 31 intermediate risk (55%) and 7 high risk (12.5%). After induction treatment, 54 patients (96.4%) achieved CR and 2 (3.6%) died from haemorrhage (1) and infection (1). ATRA syndrome was documented in 5 patients (9.3%): 13/56 patients (23.2%) showed during induction other toxicities (WHO 3 \u2013 4) not related to ATRA. After CR achievement, 2 patients died in CR from haemorrhage (1) and infection (1) and 52 received the consolidation course: on the whole, during consolidation 4 patients (7.6%) had a toxicity WHO 3 \u2013 4 and 2 of them (3.8%) died from haemorrhage (1) and infection (1). The remaining 50 patients started maintenance treatment: up to now, 12 patients (22.2%) relapsed, after a median time from morphological CR of 19 months (range 7 \u2013 86). Overall survival (OS) was 76.1% and 73.3% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Disease free survival (DFS) was 64.5% and 61.3% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. At the univariate analysis, PS =2 (p=0.0019), WBC count > 3 x 10 9 /l (p=0.018) and male gender (p=0.03) had a bad prognostic impact on DFS, while only PS=2 (p=0.05) did it on OS. Age, PLTS count, WBC count > 10 x 10 9 /l, and risk score did not affect both OS and DFS. At the multivariate analysis on DFS, only PS =2 retained prognostic significance (HR = 3.8). In conclusion, the amended GIMEMA protocol has shown to be effective and safe in elderly APL patients, as the rate of death in CR was reduced when compared with previous results in not amended GIMEMA LAP AIDA 0493: however, to face with a relapse rate > 20%, future strategies might be designed which exploit the use of more targeted approaches including combinations of ATRA, arsenic trioxide, and anti-CD33 monoclonal antibodies."
