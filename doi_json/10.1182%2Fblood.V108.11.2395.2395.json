    "abstract_text": "In neoplasms, the presence of chromosomal abnormalities and point mutations is suggestive of genomic instability, but could also be a consequence of selection. While genomic instability may increase the chances that a malignant population acquires adaptive mutations, extremely high mutation rates may not be compatible with cell survival. To investigate the role of genomic instability in lymphoid neoplasms, we have applied a new method for the quantification of the human mutation rate, using the PIG-A gene as a sentinel. PIG-A is essential for the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) and is mutated in blood cells of patients with Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria. A broad range of mutations can produce the GPI (\u2212) phenotype, and because PIG-A is on the X-chromosome, the effect of a single mutation is detectable. Since a host of proteins require GPI for attachment to the cell surface, rare mutants are readily detected by flow cytometry. We have previously shown that PIG-A mutations arise spontaneously in normal donors, and we determined that the mutation rate in normal B cell lines ranges from 2 to 29 per 10 7 cell divisions. Here we analyzed cell lines derived from: a transformed low grade lymphoma harboring a t(14;18) translocation; a mantle cell lymphoma harboring a t(11;14) translocation; a marginal zone lymphoma; and T cell ALL. Cells were first stained with an antibody specific for CD59 (a representative GPI-linked protein) and pre-existing GPI (\u2212) cells were eliminated from the population by flow cytometric sorting, by gating on the upper 50th percentile of the distribution curve. The collected GPI (+) cells were then returned to culture and the number of cell divisions ( d ) determined by cell counts. After 3\u20134 weeks, the frequency ( f ) of new mutants arising in culture was determined by flow cytometric analysis of a large number of cells (median 2.3 x 10 6 ). Cells were stained simultaneously with antibodies specific for at least 3 GPI-linked proteins (e.g. CD48, CD52, CD55, and CD59) as well as a transmembrane protein (e.g. HLA-DR or CD45) to identify live cells. FLAER and proaerolysin-- which bind to GPI-- were used to confirm the phenotype. The frequency of mutants was determined by the number of GPI(\u2212) cells divided by the number of GPI(+) cells analyzed, and the mutation rate (\u03bc) was calculated with the formula \u03bc = f \u00f7 d . We demonstrated a high mutation rate in 3 out of the 4 cells lines: 1750 x 10 \u22127 (transformed lymphoma), 335 x 10 \u22127 (mantle cell lymphoma), 112 x 10 \u22127 (T cell ALL). Of note, the mutation rate was normal (4 x 10 \u22127 ) in the marginal zone lymphoma\u2014consistent with this being an indolent neoplasm. These data support the hypothesis that an elevated mutation rate is part and parcel of aggressive neoplasms and demonstrate that a 2-log elevation in this parameter is compatible with cell survival. With this model, it may be possible to predict the development of mutations that confer chemotherapy drug resistance.",
