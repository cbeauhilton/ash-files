    "abstract_text": "Activating FLT3 mutations have been identified as prognostic factors in multiple myeloid malignancies. Recent studies have demonstrated that ligand-independent activation of FLT3 can also result from overexpression of wild-type FLT3. In addition, ligand-dependent activation has been observed in leukemic cells co-expressing FLT3 ligand ( FLT3L ), resulting in autocrine FLT3 signaling which is independent of FLT3 mutations. In Juvenile Myelo-Monocytic Leukemia (JMML), FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3/ITDs) mutations affecting the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) are rare. However, no data are yet available on the frequency of expression levels of FLT3 and FLT3L in JMML. If activated FLT3 occurs in JMML, one could imagine that these patients might benefit from treatment with small molecule FLT3 inhibitors, especially as to date the curative treatment of JMML is limited to allogeneous bone marrow transplantation. In 36 JMML patients FLT3 and FLT3L mRNA levels were assessed using real-time quantitative PCR (Taqman). Furthermore these samples were screened for the presence of activating FLT3/ITDs and FLT3/TKD mutations. MTT assays were performed to assess the response of JMML cells to the known FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 (Novartis). FLT3 appeared to be expressed only at basal levels and FLT3L expression was very low. In none of the 36 JMML samples FLT3/ITDs or TDK mutations were found, consistent with the observation that PKC412 was not cytotoxic in JMML samples (n=12), in contrast to leukemic cells of children with ALL which carried an activated FLT3. These data suggest that constitutively activated FLT3 does not occur in JMML. Therefore targeting FLT3 by tyrosine kinase inhibitors like PKC412 is unlikely to be effective in JMML.",
