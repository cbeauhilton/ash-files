    "abstract_text": "Abstract 825 Plerixafor (Mozobil\u00ae, Genzyme), an antagonist of the alpha chemokine receptor CXCR4, is highly effective as a novel PBSC mobilisation agent for patients failing to mobilise PBSC by conventional means, and is now licensed for this indication in Europe and the USA. However, significantly larger cryopreservation volumes have been reported as a disadvantage when plerixafor is used as part of PBSC mobilisation regimes (Tanhehco et al., Journal of Clinical Apheresis 2010, advance online publication). Although not an insurmountable problem in our own experience, this does increase liquid nitrogen freezer space requirements and also increases DMSO exposure for the patient at the time of re-infusion. In the course of a pre-marketing audit of the Version 5 PBSC collection software for the new Spectra Optia\u00ae apheresis platform (CaridianBCT), we observed significantly lower cryopreservation volumes for plerixafor collections when using Spectra Optia\u00ae than when using the widely-used mononuclear cell (MNC) setting (\u201cVersion 4.1\u201d) on the conventional COBE\u00ae Spectra (Caridian BCT) apheresis platform. Formal audit was carried out of a series of 21 consecutive aphereses for PBSC procurement from 16 patients where plerixafor had been used as part of the conditioning regime, with Spectra Optia\u00ae being used for 10 procedures and COBE\u00ae Spectra for 11. Cryopreservation volume was strikingly and significantly lower for the Spectra Optia\u00ae procedures (median 351 mls; range 170 \u2013 716 mls) than for COBE\u00ae Spectra procedures (median 756 mls; range 524 \u2013 2400 mls; p<0.001). Extension of this audit to a comparator group of 26 procedures on a temporally matched series of 18 consecutive patients where plerixafor was not used as part of the conditioning regime, of which Spectra Optia\u00ae was used for 7 procedures and COBE\u00ae Spectra for the remainder, did show lower cryopreservation volume for non-plerixafor collections compared with the 22 plerixafor collections though this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.11). The total white cell count was noted to be significantly higher on the day of PBSC collection for the plerixafor group (median WCC 29.8 \u00d7 10 \u22c0 9/l) compared to the non-plerixafor group (median WCC 15.1 \u00d7 10 \u22c0 9/l; p0.05). However, comparison of Spectra Optia\u00ae collections with COBE\u00ae Spectra collections for all 47 procedures (plerixafor plus non-plerixafor collections) showed significantly lower cryopreservation volumes for Spectra Optia\u00ae (p<0.01). Initial results with Spectra Optia\u00ae have shown that it yields a purer product than COBE\u00ae Spectra MNC, with lower granulocyte contamination, while maintaining the high PBSC collection efficiency of COBE\u00ae Spectra MNC (CaridianBCT, personal communication). In our experience, this translates into a greater than 50% reduction in median cryopreservation volume in the context of collection procedures where plerixafor is used as part of the conditioning regime, probably because of the higher total peripheral WCC seen in plerixafor-mobilised patients which leads to significant granulocyte contamination of the product with older cell separator platforms. Spectra Optia\u00ae therefore shows great promise as a solution to the problem of higher cryopreservation volumes when using plerixafor.
