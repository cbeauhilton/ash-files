    "abstract_text": "Background : Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by accumulation of clonal malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). CD45 was initially characterized as a leucocyte common antigen and can be found on all hematopoietic cells and is a key regulator of antigen mediated signaling and activation in B and T-lymphocytes. The expression of CD45 appears to be heterogeneous among the plasma cells in MM and this characteristic has been suggested to have biological and prognostic significance. Goals : To study CD45 expression by flow cytometry (FC) on BM plasma cells from patients with different stages of MM, and compared CD45 expression to key clinical and biological characteristics including clinical outcome, labeling index (%S-phase), bone marrow angiogenesis, and bone disease. In addition, the expression profile of various adhesion molecules on CD45+ vs CD45\u2212 plasma cells was studied. Results : BM from seventy-five patients seen at the Mayo Clinic during 1995 and diagnosed with newly diagnosed MM (29), relapsed MM (17), smoldering MM (12), and MGUS (17) were studied for CD45 expression.. CD45+ was defined as >20% of gated plasma cells expressing CD45. A mean of 30% of the plasma cells expressed CD45 by flow cytometry (median, 14%; range, 0.1 to 100%). Among the entire cohort of patients, 33 (44%) of the patients were CD45+. Patients with early disease (MGUS and SMM) had a higher percentage of plasma cells expressing CD45 compared with patients with advanced disease (new or relapsed MM) (43% vs. 22%; P = 0.005). Among those with early disease 69% were CD45 positive compared to 28% among those with advanced disease (P = 0.0008). Among the 46 patients with advanced disease, the mean percentage of CD45+ plasma cells was 14% (range, 0.1 \u2013 85) for those with bone lesions compared to 34% (2 \u2013 99) for those with none; P = 0.02. Also, those with high labeling index (>=1%) had a higher percentage of CD45 expressing plasma cells than those with a low labeling index (30% for high LI vs. 15% for low LI; (P = 0.08). Among those with advanced disease, patients with low-grade angiogenesis had a higher percentage of CD45+ plasma cells; 31% vs. 13% (P = 0.03). The median overall survival for the CD45 positive group was 39 mos vs. 18 mos for the CD45 negative group, but the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.1). The expression of CD138 (syndecan-1), CD56 (NCAM) and CD54 (ICAM-1) were higher among the CD45 neg plasma cells. Other adhesion molecules, especially LFA-1, Mac-1, VLA-5, and CD44 were more often expressed on the CD45 + plasma cells. Conclusions : This study demonstrates that CD45 expression is more common in early disease and is lost with disease progression. There are important immunophenotypic and biologic differences in the CD45+ vs CD45\u2212 plasma cells that may have implications for the design of immunotherapy for MM.",
