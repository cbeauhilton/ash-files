    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1859 Genome wide RNA interference studies identified Aurora Kinase (AURK) A and B as lethal targets in Multiple Myeloma (MM) while suppression of these genes also sensitized MM to bortezomib (BTZ). MLN8237 is an oral inhibitor of AURKA. We therefore conducted a Phase I clinical trial of MLN8237 in combination with BTZ. The study enrolled a total of 19 patients at 5 institutions. 9 patients are still receiving active treatment as of the date of this report. Study Design: The phase I portion of this study uses a standard 3+3 design to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MLN8237 and BTZ in patients with relapsed/refractory MM. Eligibility required a minimum of 1 and maximum of 4 lines of prior therapy. Patients who have received prior BTZ therapy were allowed on trial as long as they did not progress during prior BTZ or \u2264 60 days of therapy discontinuation. The following laboratory values were required \u00a37 days prior to registration. ANC 3 1000/mL, Hgb \u22659 g/dl, PLT 3 100,000/mL, Total bilirubin \u00a31.5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN), Creatinine \u00a3 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, a baseline LVEF \u226545%. Patients were required to be able to take oral medication and to maintain a fast as required for 2 hours before and 1 hour after MLN8237 administration. Treatment Overview: The first 3 patients received MLN8237 at 25 mg po days 1\u201314 and BTZ at 1.3 mg/m 2 /dose iv. days 1, 4, 8, 11 on a 28 day schedule. Based on data from other concurrent trials an amendment changed dosing of MLN8237 to 20, 30, 40 or 50 mg po twice daily on days 1\u20137 and BTZ was given at 1.5mg/m 2 iv weekly on a 28 day schedule. Results: Median age of patients was 64, 63% were male, 31% had high risk genetics, 84% had prior stem cell transplant, 53% of patients were relapsed and 47% were relapsed and refractory to therapy. No DLTs were observed even at the highest dose level tested. However, one patient at the highest dose level required a platelet transfusion in order to initiate treatment on time in Cycle 2. Thus, a further 3 patients accrued at the highest dose level before declaring the MTD and proceeding to phase II. The highest dose level (Dose Level 3: MLN8237 50 mg po twice daily on days 1\u20137; BTZ 1.5 mg/m 2 iv. given on days 1, 8, 15, 22) was the final dose level tested (the MTD of single agent MLN8237 is 50mg as defined in other Phase I trials). The ORR was 26% (1 CR, 4 PR); when minor responses are included the ORR was 52%. Median follow up was 4.3 months (range 0.9\u201323.4) and PFS was 5.5 months. At last follow up 12 patients showed no progression and 7 had progressed. Toxicity: 63% of patients experienced a grade 3AE and 5% a grade 4 AE. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity seen in more than one patient was all hematologic with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia being common. Other toxicity of any grade regardless of attribution occurring in more than 20% of patients included neuropathy 63%, fatigue 63%, diarrhea 53%, nausea 47%,vomiting 26%, infection 32%, alopecia 21%, Conclusions: The MTD of the combination is MLN8237 50 mg po twice daily on days 1\u20137 and BTZ at 1.5mg/m2 iv weekly. Phase II testing is underway and updated results will be presented. Disclosures: Stewart: Millenium: Consultancy, Honoraria, Research Funding; Onyx: Consultancy; Celgene: Consultancy.
