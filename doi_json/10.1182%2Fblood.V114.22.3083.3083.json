    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3083 Poster Board III-20 Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors (HDACi) such as LBH589, which inhibit the zinc containing catalytic domain of HDAC of classes I, II, and IV, demonstrate activity against various malignancies, particularly lymphoid malignancies. SIRT1 is an NAD+ dependent class III histone deacetylase, which deacetylates histones as well as non-histone proteins and is not affected directly by HDACi such as LBH589. It remains controversial whether inhibition of SIRT1 or its activation is more efficacious in anticancer therapy. We have studied the activity of two novel SIRT1 activators, SRT501 and SRT2183, in Philadelphia chromosome negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines. Both pre B (NALM-6, Reh) and T cell (MOLT-4) ALL lines were treated with either SRT501 or SRT2183, as well as in combination with LBH589 and evaluated for biological and gene expression responses. SRT501 induced growth arrest and apoptosis at doses ranging from 10-100 uM, with even the lowest doses inhibiting growth at 72 hours. SRT2183 is much more potent, with growth arrest and apoptosis induced at doses ranging from 1-20 uM. PCR array analysis revealed that SRT2183 treatment leads to increased mRNA levels of pro-apoptosis, growth arrest, and DNA damage response genes. We have previously demonstrated that the activity of LBH589 is mediated in part through upregulation or acetylation of proteins involved in the DNA damage response pathways. Quantitative real-time PCR confirms that the combination of LBH589 with SRT2183 leads to significantly higher expression of GADD45A and GADD45G than either agent alone. The combination of LBH589 plus SRT2183 showed enhanced inhibition of c-Myc protein levels, phosphorylation of H2A.X, and interestingly, increased acetylation of p53 (acetylation of p53 was not seen with SRT2183 alone). In summary, the novel SIRT1 activators SRT501 and SRT2183 show growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic activity in Ph- ALL alone and enhanced activity in combination with LBH589. Clinical studies of these agents, particularly in combination with HDACi are warranted. Disclosures Kirschbaum: Novartis: Consultancy. Cermak: Sirtris: Employment. Atadja: Novartis: Employment.",
