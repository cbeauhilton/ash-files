    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3207 Introduction: Miglustat (Zavesca \u00ae ) was approved for the treatment of adults with mild-to-moderate type 1 Gaucher disease (GD1) for whom enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is either unsuitable or not a therapeutic option in the EU in 2002 and in the USA in 2003. However, data from real-world clinical experience with miglustat remain limited. Methods: Medical chart data were collected from consecutive adult GD1 patients who initiated commercial miglustat therapy at centers in 9 EU countries or the US after 20 th November 2002. Both ERT-nai\u0308ve and ERT-pretreated patients were included. Follow-up data were collected from miglustat initiation to the end of the observation period (i.e. last information/visit before the end of the study on 31 st December 2008, death or loss to follow up). Data on patient demographics, medical history and disease characteristics were collected. Outcome assessments included hematological and biochemical parameters, liver/spleen volumes, gastrointestinal signs/symptoms and neurological manifestations. Results: 115 patients (55% female; mean\u00b1SD age at miglustat initiation 45\u00b114 years) were enrolled, among whom 34 (30%) were ERT-nai\u0308ve and 81 (70%) were ERT-pretreated. The median (range) miglustat exposure was 15 (1 \u2013 53) months in ERT-nai\u0308ve and 15 (0 \u2013 62) months in ERT-pretreated patients. At the time of miglustat initiation the median (range) hemoglobin concentration in ERT-nai\u0308ve patients (n=24) was 12.8 (10.2 \u2013 16.4) g/dl, and in ERT-pretreated patients (n=65) it was 13.6 (7.3 \u2013 17.4) g/dl; 5 patients in each group had anemia. The median (range) change in hemoglobin from miglustat initiation to last assessment in ERT-nai\u0308ve patients was 0.3 (\u22122.5 \u2013 3.6) g/dl, and in ERT-pretreated patients it was \u22120.3 (\u22124 \u2013 4.6) g/dl. In the subgroup of patients with anemia the median (range) change was 1.3 (0.1 \u2013 3.6) g/dl in the 5 ERT-nai\u0308ve patients and 2.6 (\u22122.7 \u2013 4.6) in the 5 ERT-pretreated patients. At the time of miglustat initiation the median (range) platelet count in ERT-nai\u0308ve patients (n=25) was 101 (37 \u2013 730) \u00d710 9 /l, and in ERT-pretreated patients (n=65) it was 173 (43 \u2013 382) \u00d710 9 /l; 12 patients in the ERT-nai\u0308ve and 9 in the ERT-pretreated group had thrombocytopenia. The median (range) change in platelet count was 8 (\u221277 \u2013 145) \u00d710 9 /l in ERT-nai\u0308ve patients and \u221210 (\u2212144 \u2013 434) \u00d710 9 /l in ERT-pretreated patients. In the subgroup of patients with thrombocytopenia, the median (range) change was 31 (\u221229 \u2013 145) \u00d710 9 /l in the 12 ERT-nai\u0308ve patients and 14 (\u221232 \u2013 434) \u00d710 9 /l in the 9 ERT-pretreated patients. Plasma chitotriosidase was highly variable. Substantial median (range) reductions were seen in 20 evaluable ERT-nai\u0308ve patients [\u22121365 (\u221213216 \u2013 3477) nmol/ml/h] but not in the 43 evaluable ERT-pretreated patients [20 (\u22122700 \u2013 12431) nmol/ml/h]. Few patients had spleen and liver organ volume data recorded. Forty-nine patients (43%) discontinued miglustat during the observation period. Tolerability issues, primarily gastrointestinal, were the most frequent reason for discontinuation, accounting for 32 (28%) of all 115 patients. Other reasons included: non-medical (n=7), insufficient efficacy (n=5), switch to ERT (n=4), and patient death (n=1). Tremor was observed in 3/115 (3%) patients before, and in 18/115 (16%) after miglustat initiation. Conclusions: Based on hematological parameters, we observed that miglustat can maintain disease stability in GD1 patients, irrespective of previous ERT therapy. Although based on a limited number of patients, benefits appeared more pronounced in analyses of anemic and thrombocytopenic patients. Gastrointestinal manifestations remain a concern, leading to discontinuation in around one-third of patients. The safety profile of miglustat was similar to that in previous clinical trials.
