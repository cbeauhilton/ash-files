    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3773 Poster Board III-709 Introduction The tumor suppressor protein p53 induces cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in response to various forms of cellular stress, through transcriptional regulation of a large number of down stream target genes. p53 is frequently mutated in cancer, and cancer cells carrying defects in the p53 protein are often more resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Thus, restoration of the wild type function to mutant p53 appears to be a new attractive strategy for cancer therapy. APR-246 is a novel small molecule quinuclidinone compound that has been shown to reactivate non-functional p53 and induce apoptosis. Although the exact molecular mechanism remains to be determined, recent results suggest that an active metabolite of APR-246 alkylates thiol groups in the core domain of p53, which promotes correct folding of p53 and induces apoptosis (Lambert et al ., Cancer Cell 15, 2009). Currently, APR-246 is in Phase I/IIa clinical trials for hematological malignancies and prostate cancer. In the present abstract results from in vitro , ex vivo and in vivo preclinical studies with APR-246 are presented. Results The lead compound of APR-246, PRIMA-1 ( p 53 r eactivation and i nduction of m assive a poptosis), was originally identified by a cellular screening of the NCI library for low molecular weight compounds (Bykov et al., Nat. Med., 8, 2002). Further development and optimization of PRIMA-1 led to the discovery of the structural analog APR-246 (PRIMA-1 MET ), with improved drug like and preclinical characteristics. In in vitro experiments APR-246 reduced cell viability (WST-1 assay) in a large number of human cancer cell lines with various p53 status, including several leukemia (CCRF-CEM, CEM/VM-1, KBM3), lymphoma (U-937 GTP, U-937-vcr), and myeloma (RPMI 8226/S, 8226/dox40, 8226/LR5) cell lines, as well as many solid cancer cell lines, including osteosarcoma (SaOS-2, SaOS-2-His273,U-2OS), prostate (PC3, PC3-His175, 22Rv1), breast (BT474, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231), lung (H1299, H1299-His175) and colon cancer (HT-29). In human osteosarcoma cell lines APR-246 reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis (FLICA caspase assay) in a concentration dependent manner being more potent in the p53 mutant (SaOS-2-His273) than in the parental p53 null (SaOS-2) cells. The IC50 values (WST-1 assay) were 14 \u00b1 3 and 27 \u00b1 5 \u03bcM, respectively (n=35). In in vivo subcutaneous xenograft studies in SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice APR-246 reduced growth of p53 mutant SaOS-2-His273 cells in a dose-dependent manner, when injected i.v. twice daily with 20 -100 mg/kg (64 \u2013 76% inhibition). An in vivo anticancer effect of APR-246 was also observed in hollow-fiber test with NMRI mice using the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line MV-4-11. An ex vivo cytotoxic effect of APR-246 and/or its lead compound PRIMA-1 has also been shown in primary cells from AML and CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) patients, harbouring both hemizygously deleted p53 as well as normal karyotype (Nahi et al ., Br. J. Haematol., 127, 2004; Nahi et al ., Br. J. Haematol., 132, 2005; Jonsson-Videsater et al ., abstract at this meeting). APR-246 was also tested in a FMCA (fluorometric microculture assay) test using normal healthy lymphocytes (PBMC) and cancer lymphocytes (CLL). It was 4-8 fold more potent in killing cancer cells than normal cells, indicating a favorable therapeutic index. This is in contrast to conventional cytostatics that often show negative ratio in this test. Furthermore, when tested in a well-defined panel of 10 human cancer cell lines consisting of both hematological and solid cancer cell lines, the cytotoxicity profile/activity pattern of APR-246 differed from common chemotherapeutic drugs (correlation coefficient less than 0.4), suggesting a different mechanism of action. Conclusion In relevant in vitro , in vivo and ex vivo cancer models, APR-246 showed unique pharmacological properties in comparison with conventional cytostatics, by being effective also in cancer cells with p53 mutations and by demonstrating tumor specificity. Moreover, in experimental safety/toxicology models required to start clinical trials, APR-246 was non toxic at the predicted therapeutic plasma concentrations. Thus, APR-246 appears to be a promising novel anticancer compound that may specifically target cancer cells in patients with genetic abnormality associated with poor prognosis.
