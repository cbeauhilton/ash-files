    "abstract_text": "Introduction: MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1) is a key mediator of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, the main driver of a subset of B-cell lymphomas and functions by forming a complex with CARMA1 and BCL10 to mediate antigen receptor-induced lymphocyte activation. MALT1 is considered a potential therapeutic target for several subtypes of non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Previously, we described the discovery of novel and potent MALT1 inhibitors with anti-proliferative effects in non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma cells. Here, we highlight the strong anti-tumor activity of our MALT1 inhibitors across multiple tumor models and the combination potential with agents including standard-of-care. Results: Novel small molecule MALT1 inhibitors were identified using Schrodinger's proprietary physics-based free energy perturbation (FEP+) modeling technology. These molecules demonstrate strong MALT1 protein binding affinity, potent inhibition of MALT1 enzymatic activity and anti-proliferative activity in the activated B-cell (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines such as OCI-LY3 and OCI-LY10. In combination with approved agents, these inhibitors demonstrate strong combination potential with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors such as ibrutinib in ABC-DLBCL cell lines. In ABC-DLBCL CDX models, our representative MALT1 inhibitor induces tumor regression as a single agent and complete tumor regression in combination with ibrutinib. Our representative MALT1 inhibitor, when tested in LY2298 PDX models, demonstrates similar results. In addition, our representative MALT1 inhibitor was explored in a CDX model derived from a Mantle cell lymphoma REC-1 cell line, and demonstrates strong anti-tumor activity of ~78% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) as a single agent. Conclusions : Schrodinger's novel, potent MALT1 protease small molecule inhibitors are efficacious in in vitro B-cell lymphoma cell proliferation assays and in in vivo B-cell lymphoma xenograft models. These data suggest that targeting MALT1 may expand therapeutic options for patients with selected B-cell lymphomas, such as ABC-DLBCL, with the possibility of expanding into other B-cell lymphomas such as MCL. Furthermore, these small molecule MALT1 inhibitors demonstrate potential in combination with BTKi to overcome drug-induced resistance in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas. Taken together, the data presented here strongly underscore the therapeutic potential of our MALT1 inhibitor and support further evaluation in clinical trials.
