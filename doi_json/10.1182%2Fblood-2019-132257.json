    "abstract_text": "Introduction Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a common cause of acquired thrombocytopenia in an otherwise asymptomatic adult. It is generally believed to be caused by auto- antibodies against platelet antigens that destroy platelets peripherally and autoreactive cytotoxic T cells, as well as humoral and cellular autoimmunity directed at megakaryocytes, causing impaired platelet production. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a known cause of cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with immunosuppressed states, whereas in immunocompetent patients, it commonly manifest as asymptomatic or mononucleosis like syndrome. We are presenting a case of CMV induced thrombocytopenia with severe epistaxis and platelet count of 0 x10 9 in an otherwise healthy immunocompetent male who failed to improve after standard treatments with high dose steroids and intra venous immune globulin (IVIG). Case Description A 36-year-old Caucasian male without any past medical history presented to emergency room (ER) with flu like symptoms for five days associated with subjective fevers, anorexia, nausea, cough and weight loss of 15 lb. in two weeks. He also reported possible tick bite while working in the yard two days prior to admission. No dizziness, vomiting, diarrhea or any bleeding were reported. Denied any smoking, alcohol use or any illicit drug use. No significant family history was reported. On evaluation he was afebrile, normotensive with normal heart rate and respiratory rate. Physical examination was unremarkable. Initial laboratory data revealed hemoglobin of 11.2, platelet count 4 x10 9 , white cell count of 13,100 with 4.5% atypical lymphocytes, aspartate aminotransferase of 41, alanine aminotransferase of 49, and creatinine of 1.4. He tested positive for Influenza A, CMV Immune globulin (Ig)M and IgG antibody. Serological tests for tick panel including anaplasma, babesia, Lyme disease and ehrlichia were negative. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody, parvo virus antibody, hepatitis screen, HIV screen, auto antibodies including anti-nuclear antibody and anti-double stranded DNA were negative. Coombs test was negative. Further work up includes ADAMTS13 activity was normal. No laboratory evidence of ADAMTS13 deficiency. After excluding all other causes, diagnosis of ITP was made. He was started on Tamiflu for Influenza A and high dose intra venous (IV) methyl prednisone for ITP. After platelet transfusion and two days of IV steroids platelet count improved 43 x 10 9 and he was discharged home with prolonged prednisone taper. Five days later, he presented to ER with severe epistaxis. Laboratory data revealed platelet count of 0 x10 9 . Serum CMV-DNA was determined by PCR showed viral load of 8,790 copies/ml. Ultrasound abdomen showed mild splenomegaly. He received three doses of IVIG (1g/kg). Platelet count failed to improve after administration of IVIG. Bone marrow biopsy revealed hyper cellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis with no increase in CD 34 blasts. Per infectious disease and hematology recommendations, he was started on valganciclovir (900 mg PO BID). One month later, platelet count improved to 150 x 10 9 and CMV viral load dropped to 413 with subsequent resolution of patient's symptoms. Discussion Secondary ITP is an acquired thrombocytopenia caused by autoantibodies against platelets. Many patients with ITP are asymptomatic. For those who do have symptoms, initial presentations of ITP are petechiae, purpura and epistaxis, with a more severe progression to intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding leading to a fatal outcome, if treatment is not started on a promptly manner. CMV induced thrombocytopenia in immunocompetent adults seems to be rare. we are presenting a case of CMV induced ITP which failed to improve after standard treatment with high dose steroids and IVIG but responded to anti-viral therapy with valganciclovir. In conclusion, it may be worthwhile to test for CMV infection in patients presenting with ITP. Further research is needed in order to establish treatment guidelines for CMV induced ITP in immunocompetent adults. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
