    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1839 The PIM kinases are a family of 3 growth factor- & cytokine-induced proteins hypothesized to have redundant survival and growth functions. Although PIM-1, -2 have been noted as highly expressed in multiple myeloma (MM) ( Claudio JO et al., 2002 ), there are few data to support potential therapeutic utility of PIM inhibition in this indication. Here we show that the myeloma cell lines express all PIM protein isoforms to varying extents, and we describe the properties of a novel pan-PIM inhibitor GNE-652 with picomolar biochemical potency, an excellent selectivity profile, and favorable ADME properties. Myeloma cell lines and patient samples exhibit a striking prevalence of response to GNE-652 (23 of 25 lines with IC50 < 1 micromolar, median < 0.1 micromolar) and synergy in combination with the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 (mean combination index values \u223c0.2 (n=25)). MM cells respond to this combination with cell cycle arrest and marked apoptosis in vitro . Conversely, a PIM-1, -3 selective inhibitor, GNE-568, failed to suppress MM cell growth and also failed to provide synergy in combination with PI3K inhibition, suggesting PIM-2 is a critical driver of MM cell growth & survival. Additional results suggest that PIM signaling converges on both TORC1 and AKT to generate differential synergies with PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors. PIM has been shown to potentially inactivate PRAS40, a negative regulator of TORC1 ( Zhang et al., 2009 ). We demonstrate that PIM or PI3K inhibition caused a loss of phosphorylation on PRAS40 and resulted in a physical association of PRAS40 and TORC1 and a decrease in phosphorylated p70S6K and S6RP. These reductions were apparent in 7 of 7 cell lines assayed and enhanced by the combination of PI3K and PIM inhibition. Consistent with prior reports ( Hammerman et al., 2005 ), we show that a second node of convergence between PIM and TORC1 is 4E-BP1. Both GDC-0941 and GNE-652 treatments reduced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in all the myeloma cell lines tested. Since dephosphorylated 4E-BP1 competes with eIF4G for the mRNA cap binding factor eIF4E, we assayed immunoprecipitates of eIF4E for the presence of eIF4G and 4E-BP1 and observed increased BP1 and decreased 4G. The combination treatment significantly enhanced the loss of 4G relative to either single agent, and importantly, even at 5 \u00d7 IC50 concentrations for single agents, combination drug treatment achieved greater extent of effect than single agent treatment. It has been hypothesized that a subset of mRNAs are particularly sensitive to inhibition of cap-dependent translation, including a number of oncogenes such as cyclin D1. We noted across 7 different myeloma cell lines, strong decreases in levels of cyclin D1, and D3 that were further decreased by combination treatment of PIM and PI3K inhibition. In summary, we have identified several points at which PIM and PI3K/AKT/mTOR converge to provide synergy in multiple myeloma cell lines. As PIM isoforms are highly expressed in MM cells, we hypothesized that this could be due to proteosomal-mediated stability, and interestingly, MG132 and velcade each stabilized all PIM isoforms. It is commonly known that the JAK/STAT pathway regulates PIM transcription, but we show JAK inhibitors failed to abolish the expression of PIM in myeloma cells, suggesting a role for additional regulators. Recent genome sequencing studies from human myeloma samples ( Chapman MA et al., 2011 ) confirmed the prevalence of NF-kB pathway activation, consistent with prior observations made in MM cell lines ( Demchenko YN et al., 2010 ). The relationship of PIM and NF-kB is controversial in the literature ( Hammerman PS et al., 2004 & Zhu N et al., 2002 ), with some groups placing PIM upstream of NF-kB and others the converse. Using an I\u03baB\u03b1 inhibitor, BMS-345541, we have examined the role for NF-kB in the regulation of PIM kinases. Here, we show that the BMS-345541 could preferentially suppress PIM2 expression in a dose dependent manner while PIM 1, 3 levels are modestly affected, suggesting that the high levels of PIM2 expression observed are partly driven by deregulation of the NF-kB pathway in MM. In conclusion, we provide pharmacological and biochemical evidence to suggest that PIM2 differentially regulate growth and survival of myeloma cells. Our results provide the rationale for further preclinical development of PIM inhibitors and the basis for a possible clinical development plan in multiple myeloma.
