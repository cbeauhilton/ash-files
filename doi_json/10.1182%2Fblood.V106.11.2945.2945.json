    "abstract_text": "Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and unmutated IgV H genes or high ZAP-70 expression have poorer prognosis than those with mutated IgV H genes or low ZAP-70 levels. This is in part related to the resistance of unmutated and ZAP-70 positive cases to treatment agents that induce apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. It has been suggested that corticosteroids are active in CLL through p53-independent pathways. The aim of this study was to analyze the \u201cex vivo\u201d response to dexamethasone in CLL cells according to the IgV H mutational status and ZAP-70 expression. Frozen lymphocytes from 60 patients with CLL were analyzed for ZAP-70 expression and IgV H mutational status (n=44). Cells were cultured and treated using fludarabine (5\u03bcgr/ml), mitoxantrone (0.5\u03bcgr/ml), FCM (fludarabine 1\u03bcgr/ml, maphosphamide 1\u03bcgr/ml and mitoxantrone 0.5 \u03bcgr/ml), and dexamethasone (5.2 \u03bcg/mL). Cell viability and apoptosis were determined by annexinV/PI staining and FACscan analysis at three different time points and conditions (0h and 24h without treatment, and 24h with treatment). The expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) isoforms alpha, beta and gamma was analyzed by Quantitative RT-PCR in 20 cases. Dexamethasone-induced apoptosis was significantly higher in patients with unmutated IgV H and/or high ZAP-70 expression (\u226520%) than in those with mutated IgV H and/or low ZAP-70 expression (median cell viability 65% vs. 81%, respectively; p<0.001). In contrast, mitoxantrone induced higher cell toxicity in patients with IgV H mutations or low ZAP-70 expression (p=0.009). No differences in cell viability were found according to ZAP-70 expression or IgV H mutational status after \u201cex vivo\u201d treatment with fludarabine or FCM (p=0.649 and p=0.055, respectively). Expression of different GR isoforms was similar in corticosteroid-responders and non-responders. In conclusion, in this study CLL cells with unmutated IgV H genes or high ZAP-70 expression showed a higher cell mortality after \u201cex vivo\u201d exposure to dexamethasone than those with mutated IgV H genes or low ZAP-70 expression, with no relationship with the expression of the different GR isoforms. These data give conceptual support to trials aimed at determining the role of dexamethasone in the treatment of patients with CLL and poor prognostic features or resistant to fludarabine.
