    "abstract_text": "Prolonged pharmacologic immunosuppression is a major obstacle to early immunologic recovery after allogeneic BMT. Based on our results in animal models, we studied whether properly timed high-dose Cy post-HLA matched related and unrelated BMT is an effective strategy for limiting GVHD; we hypothesized that avoiding prolonged immunosuppression would speed immune recovery and reconstitution of regulatory T cells (T regs) thereby decreasing post-transplant complications. We are reporting results on 46 consecutive patients (median age 41, range 1\u201364) with high-risk hematologic malignancies (20 AML, 12 ALL, 6 NHL, 3 HD, 2 MM, 2 CML, 1 CMMoL); 28 received related and 18 unrelated unmanipulated HLA-matched BM (median of 2.2 x 10 8 MNC per kg) after conditioning with busulfan on days -7 to -3 and Cy (50 mg/kg/day) on days -2 and -1, and followed by Cy (50 mg/kg/day) on days +3 and +4 as the sole GVHD prophylaxis. All the patients had advanced disease (20 in advanced remission with the rest having refractory disease), and the median follow-up is 13 (range 6\u201324) months. All but two patients had sustained engraftment. The cumulative incidence of acute grades II\u2013IV and grades III\u2013IV GVHD were 41% and 9%, respectively. All patients with GVHD responded fully to standard therapy (steroids \u00b1 tacrolimus) or therapy per BMT CTN0302, and all except 2 patients were rapidly weaned from all immunosuppressive agents. Of the thirty-six patients alive after day 100, only 1 of the 23 patients that received HLA-matched related, and 3 of 13 patients that received unrelated allografts, developed chronic GVHD. Twenty-six (56%) patients are alive, of whom 21 (45%) are in complete remission. There were no deaths secondary to infection or GVHD. CMV reactivation was detected in 11 of 36 (31%) patients, of whom 9 had GVHD. There was no CMV infection. Median (\u00b1 SEM) CD4 + T cell counts were 99 \u00b1 16/mL and 209 \u00b1 49/mL on days 60 (n = 23) and 180 (n= 8), respectively. Corresponding values for CD8 + T cells were 248 \u00b1 132/mL and 228 \u00b1 161/mL on days 60 and 180, respectively. Patients with grade II\u2013IV GVHD had significantly fewer peripheral blood (PB) CD4 + Foxp3 + T cells compared to patients with grade 0\u2013I GVHD (p<0.05). Development of grade II\u2013IV GVHD negatively correlated with the expression of the Foxp3 (p<0.05) and was associated with relatively higher expression of interferon-\u03b3 mRNA (p=0.08) in PB, suggesting higher effector function in the absence of Tregs in patients with grade II\u2013IV GVHD. No differences in IL-10 mRNA expression between patients with or without GVHD were found, while significantly higher expression of interleukin-2 mRNA was detected in patients with grade II\u2013IV GVHD (p<0.025). These results indicate that high-dose post-transplantation Cy is effective as a single agent strategy for limiting acute and chronic GVHD after myeloablative HLA-matched related and unrelated allografting; this approach also limits the need for prolonged immunosuppression, resulting in favorable immunoreconstitution with few opportunistic infections in this unfavorable group of patients. Longer follow-up and larger numbers of patients are needed to assess the impact of this strategy on survival."
