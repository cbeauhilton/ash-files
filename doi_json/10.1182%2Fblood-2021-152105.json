    "abstract_text": "Background: Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) has long been pursued to improve outcomes in acute leukemia. Of current interest are alpha-particle emitting radionuclides as they deliver a very large amount of radiation over just a few cell diameters, enabling efficient and selective target cell kill. So far, alpha-emitters including astatine-211 ( 211 At) have been primarily explored with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting CD45 or CD33 but their broad display on non-malignant target-expressing cells can lead to marked \"on-target, off tumor cell\" toxicities. To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel form of 211 At-based RIT targeting CD123. CD123 is displayed widely on acute leukemia cells, including underlying leukemic stem cells, but is expressed only on a discrete subset of normal hematopoietic cells and is virtually absent on non-blood cells. Methods: We immunized BALB/c mice with peptides consisting of the extracellular domain of human CD123 to generate anti-CD123 mAbs. Flow cytometry-based assays with human acute leukemia cell lines were used to characterize binding of hybridoma supernatants and mAbs to CD123. mAbs were conjugated with isothiocyantophenethyl-ureido- closo -decaborate(2-) (B10), a boron cage molecule for subsequent astatination, and were then labeled with 211 At. In vivo leukemia cell targeting (\"biodistribution\") and efficacy studies were conducted in immunodeficient NOD-Rag1 null IL2r\u0263 null /J (NRG) mice xenografted with MOLM-13 cells, a CD123+ human acute myeloid leukemia cell line. Results: Based on initial hybridoma screening studies, we selected 4 mAbs (10C4, 5G4, 11F11, and 1H8) for further characterization. Phenotyping studies with CD123+ and CD123- human acute leukemia cell lines (including CD123+ cell lines in which CD123 was deleted via CRISPR/Cas9) confirmed specific binding of all mAbs to human CD123 (binding intensity: 10C4>5G4=11F11=1H8), with 10C4 yielding a higher median fluorescence intensity than the widely used commercial anti-CD123 mAb clones, 7G3 and 6H6 ( Figure 1 ). In vitro internalization with a panel of human acute leukemia cell lines studies demonstrated uptake of all mAbs by CD123+ target cells with a kinetic slower than that for anti-CD33 antibodies (typically, 30-50% of the anti-CD123 mAb internalized over 2-4 hours). All 4 anti-CD123 mAbs could be conjugated to B10 and subsequently labeled with 211 At. Unlike a non-binding 211 At-labeled control mAb, 211 At-labeled anti-CD123 mAbs showed uptake at MOLM-13 flank tumors in NRG mice carrying MOLM-13 xenografts. After additional leukemia cell targeting studies to optimize the dosing of 10C4, we conducted proof-of-concept efficacy studies in NRG mice injected intravenously with luciferase-transduced MOLM-13 cells (disseminated leukemia model). Animals were either untreated or treated with 10 \u00b5Ci, 20 \u00b5Ci, or 40 \u00b5Ci of 211 At-labeled 10C4-B10 mAb (9-11 animals/group). This was followed by the infusion of bone marrow cells from donor mice as stem cell support 3 days later. As shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 , 211 At-10C4-B10 led to a dose dependent decrease in tumor burden. Further, the treatment significantly prolonged survival compared to untreated animals (median survival: 49 days [40 \u00b5Ci of 211 At] vs . 31 days [10 \u00b5Ci of 211 At] vs . 21 days [Ctrl]; P <0.0001 for Ctrl vs . 10 \u00b5Ci, P<0.004 for 10 \u00b5Ci vs . 40 \u00b5Ci), demonstrating potent in vivo anti-leukemia efficacy of a single dose of 211 At-CD123 RIT. Conclusion: Our data support the further development of 211 At-CD123 RIT for the treatment of patients with acute leukemia and other CD123+ hematologic malignancies.
