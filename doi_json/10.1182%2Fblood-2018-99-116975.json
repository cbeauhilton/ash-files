    "abstract_text": "It has been shown that loss of c-Myc leads to accumulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and severe cytopenia as a consequence of a blockage of HSC differentiation. Here we report a role of c-Myc haploinsufficiency in regulating HSC quiescence and self-renewal. We showed that c-Myc haploinsufficient mice displayed decreased white blood count and number of lymphocytes with normal myeloid cell differentiation. The number of HSCs and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) were all decreased significantly in c-Myc haploinsufficient mice as compared with control mice. We found that c-Myc haploinsufficiency inhibited HSC self-renewal capacity, increased proliferation and decreased quiescence of HSCs in vivo. By transplantation assays, we showed that c-Myc haploinsufficiency has extrinsic and intrinsic effects on the maintenance of HSCs in vivo. Our study suggests that loss of c-Myc activity and reduced dosage of c-Myc have distinct effects on HSC functions. c-Myc is a critical downstream mediator of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway. We showed that c-Myc haploinsufficiency is sufficient to prevent severe anemia in Apc heterozygous mice, and to significantly prolong the survival of Apc heterozygous mice. In addition, treatment of Apc haploinsufficient mice by a c-Myc inhibitor significantly reversed anemia in Apc-deficient mice. By transplantation assay, we further demonstrated that reduced expression of c-Myc in the bone marrow niche is responsible for prevention of severe anemia in Apc-deficient mice. However, we found that reduction of c-Myc by loss of a single allele of c-Myc did not rescue defective self-renewal capacity of Apc haploinsufficient HSCs. Taken together, our studies indicate that c-Myc mediates the function of the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway in bone marrow niche but not in HSCs.
