    "abstract_text": "Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the demographic information, clinical and hematologic findings and treatment response of patients diagnosed with hereditary hemolytic anemias other than thalassemia at a single center. Materials and Methods: A total of 157 children with a diagnosis of hereditary hemolytic anemia except thalassemia were included. Patients' files were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics, family history, complications, history of splenectomy and cholecystectomy, splenectomy response, use of chelating agents and other treatments, first transfusion age and transfusion frequency of patients were evaluated. Mean, standard deviation, median and 25-75 percentile values were used when descriptive analysis were presented. Mann Whitney U and Kruskal Wallis Tests were used for nonparametric groups. Pearson Chi Square and Fisher Tests were used when categorical comparisons were made. A value of P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Of the 157 patients , 101 patients (64,3%) had hereditary spherocytosis, 39 patients had (24,8%) glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), 15 patients had (9,6%) sickle cell anemia and 2 patients had (1.3%) pyruvate kinase deficiency. Sixty-one patients (38,9%) were girls and 96 were boys (61,1%). Median age of diagnosis was 10 months (range 1-188 months). Of 97 patients whom family history was questioned, 63 (64.9%) had family history. Most common complaint at diagnosis was paleness. Eighty-two patients had splenomegaly. Twenty-two patients (14%) had cholecystectomy and 56 patients (35.7%) had splenectomy on follow-up. The most frequent indication for splenectomy was hereditary spherocytosis. Fifty-eight (36.9%) patients required regular transfusion. Mean ferritin level of all was 506.3\u00b11175.0. Patients with pyruvate kinase had the highest ferritin levels. Erythropoietin was used for 1 patient with hereditary spherocytosis in infancy without a response. Ten of 15 patients with sickle cell anemia were using hydroxyurea. Thirteen percent of all were using chelating agents. Conclusion: Hereditary spherocytosis and G6PD deficiency were the most common hereditary hemolytic anemias except thalassemia in our center. Family history was more frequent in hereditary spherocytosis compared to other hereditary hemolytic anemias. Patients with G6PD deficiency were diagnosed earlier than other hereditary hemolytic anemias. Hereditary spherocytosis was the most common indication for splenectomy and eliminated/decreased transfusion requirement in 96%. Patients with other hemolytic anemias had lower iron load compared to thalassemia except pyruvate kinase deficiency patients. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
