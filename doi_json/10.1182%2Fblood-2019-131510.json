    "abstract_text": "Innate immune anti-viral adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) base editing enzymes (editases) promote hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and protect the human genome from retroviral integration in response to inflammatory cytokine signaling. However, hyper-editing has been linked to therapeutic resistance and cancer progression. Because myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) progression is typified by increased JAK2/STAT-mediated cytokine signaling, we investigated the cell type and context specific role of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1 (ADAR1) editaseactivity in MPN pre-leukemia stem cell (pre-LSC) evolution into acute myeloid leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Here we show by whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) of 113 FACS-purified hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors from 78 individuals, including 54 MPN and AML patients and 24healthy young and aged individuals, that anti-viral signaling pathway activation and splice isoform switching from ADAR1p110 to JAK2/STAT-inducible ADAR1p150 RNA editase activation contributes to MPN progression. Pre-LSC evolution to LSC was characterized by ADAR1p150 upregulation, distinctive RNA editome patterns, STAT3 hyper-editing, increased replating as a measure of self-renewal. Moreover, LSC generation was typified by beta-catenin self-renewal pathway upregulation, which was recapitulated by lentiviral ADAR1p150 overexpression and reversed by lentiviral ADAR1p150 shRNA knockdown. Our studyunderscores the importance of inflammatory-cytokine fueled enzymatic mutagenesis in human MPN pre-LSC evolution to LSC. Thus, this study sets the stage for developing predictive RNA editome biomarkers of LSC generation to guidetherapeutic strategies aimed at preventing progression of hematopoietic malignancies.
