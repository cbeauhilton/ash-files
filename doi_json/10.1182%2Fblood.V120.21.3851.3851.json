    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3851 Clofarabine (CLO) is a nucleoside analog with activity in myeloid malignancies. We have previously reported an overall response rate (ORR) of 43% (CR rate 25%) in patients (pts) with higher-risk MDS treated with oral CLO at doses between 20 mg/m 2 and 40 mg/m 2 daily \u00d7 5 ( S Faderl et al. J Clin Oncol 2010, 28: 2755 ). However, myelosuppression and infectious complications were frequent. We therefore developed a trial based on a Bayesian randomization design of CLO 10 mg vs 20 mg (flat dose) orally daily \u00d7 5 days with the objective to maintain reasonable efficacy and minimize toxicities. Cycles were repeated every 4 to 8 weeks for up to a total of 12. Pts were eligible if they had MDS with \u2265 5% blasts (including RAEB-t by FAB) or IPSS intermediate-2 and high-risk, and CMML. Hematopoietic growth factor support prior to and during the study was permitted. Thirty-two pts (19 RAEB [59%], 7 RAEB-t [22%], 2 MDS/MPN [6%], 4 CMML [13%]) were randomized. Patient characteristics were similar between the groups and are summarized in Table 1 . Table 1: Patient Characteristics  Characteristic . 10 mg . 20 mg .

Four pts (25%) in the 10 mg group and 3 pts (19%) in the 20 mg group responded (differences not significant). Median remission duration was 6.5 months for all pts (6.5 months [10 mg]; 4.4 months [20 mg], p=.942). The median number of cycles was 2 in each treatment group with a range of 1\u20134 (10 mg) and 1\u201312 treatment cycles (20 mg), respectively. One pt in each group died. Median survival for the whole group was 8.5 months (8.2 months [10 mg]; 8.5 months [20 mg], p=.9). Clofarabine at both 10 mg and 20 mg orally daily \u00d7 5 has a comparable CR/CRp rate as do higher doses. Myelosuppression does still occur but prolonged myelosuppression has been rare. Even lower doses including at different schedules may still warrant further study. Disclosures: Faderl: Genzyme: Membership on an entity's Board of Directors or advisory committees, Research Funding.
