    "abstract_text": "Background Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is expressed on extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKL) tumor cells. The programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and PD-L1 pathway inhibits host antitumor responses; however, little is known about how this pathway functions in ENKL. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 and to determine the clinicopathological impact of PD-1 and PD-L1 positivity in ENKL. Methods We performed PD-1 and PD-L1 immunostaining in 79 ENKL biopsy samples and retrospectively analyzed medical records of all 79 patients from 4 tertiary referral hospitals. The demographic features, performance status, stage, LDH, primary sites, nodal sites, hemoglobin, white blood cell, platelet, creatinine, international prognostic index (IPI), and prognostic index for T-cell lymphoma (PIT) were recorded. Results The expression rates of PD-1-positive and PD-L1-positive ENKL were 7.6% and 88.6%, respectively (Figure 1A & 1B). PD-L1-negative ENKL (n=9) was significantly associated with high intermediate or high risk IPI (n=7, P=0.002) and group 3 or 4 PIT (n=6, P=0.043). Patients with PD-1-positive ENKL (n=6) had a trend toward better overall survival (OS) compared with that in patients with PD-1-negative ENKL (P = 0.090, Figure 2A). In contrast, there was no significant difference in OS between PD-L1-positive and -negative ENLK (P = 0.428, Figure 2B). Conclusions This is the first report describing the clinicopathological features and survival outcome according to expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in ENKL. PD-1 expression rate is very low, and PD-L1 negativity is associated with poor risk groups of IPI and PIT in ENKL View large Download slide View large Download slide Close modal View large Download slide View large Download slide Close modal Disclosures Kim: Alexion Pharmaceuticals: Research Funding; Il-Yang: Research Funding; Celgene: Research Funding; Novartis: Research Funding.",
