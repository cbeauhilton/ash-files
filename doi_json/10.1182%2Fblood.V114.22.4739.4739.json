    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4739 The CD3 molecular of the T cell receptor complex contains at least four different CD3 polypeptide chains, termed CD3\u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b5 and \u03b6 chain, which are required for cell surface expression of the TCR heterodimers on mature T lymphocytes and have a key role in signal transduction. Umbilical cord blood (UCB), as a source of allogeneic transplantation, which showed a different expression pattern of TCR\u03b1\u03b2/\u03b3\u03b4 and CD3\u03b6 from peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells in our previous studies. To further realize the feature of other CD3 subunits expression pattern of T-lymphocyte subsets in UCB, CD3\u03b3, 104, \u03b5 and \u03b6 chain genes expression level in purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells sorted by MACs were detected by real-time PCR with SYBR Green I technique, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from both 12 cases UCB and 10 healthy adults PB were selected to analyze in this study, \u03b22-microglobulin gene was used as an endogenous reference. Evaluation of relative mRNA expression level of each CD3 chain were used by the 2 -\u0394Ct +100% method. In CD4+T cells, the relative mRNA expression level of CD3\u03b3, \u03b4 and \u03b6 chain genes (16.54% \u00b1 6.49%, 3.53% \u00b1 1.15%, 5.48% + 1.10%) from UCB were significantly higher than that from PB( P =0.001, P =0.017, P =0.000, respectively). Compared with the CD8+T cells form PB, the expression level of CD3\u03b4 and \u03b6 chain genes (3.43% \u00b1 1.19%, 5.24% \u00b1 1.42%) in UCB CD8+T cells were also apparently up-regulated ( P =0.000, P =0.004). Moreover, the expression level of CD3\u03b5 chain gene in CD4+T cells of UCB(13.29%\u00b15.72%)was obviously higher than that in CD8+ T cells(7.81%\u00b14.72%, P =0.018)and was 1.67\u00b10.72 times as much as PB. The expression pattern of four CD3 chains were \u03b3>\u03b5>\u03b6>\u03b4 in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from UCB, similar expression pattern was found in CD8+ T cells from PB, in contrast, in CD4+ T cells from PB, the CD3 gene expression pattern presented as \u03b5\u03b3>\u03b6>\u03b4.As the CD3\u03b3 and CD3\u03b4 chains are highly homologous, especially in the cytoplasmic domain, our results indicated that, the ratios of CD3\u03b3/CD3\u03b4 in CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells from UCB were 3.55 and 4.69, respectively. In conclusion, this is to our knowledge, the first description of CD3\u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b5 and \u03b6 chain genes expression pattern in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from UCB, which might provide new data for further understanding the feature of T cell immune state in umbilical cord blood.
