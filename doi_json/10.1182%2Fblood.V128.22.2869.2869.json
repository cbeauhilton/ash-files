    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Cytogenetic testing is routinely performed in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) for risk stratification. Elaborate risk classifications based on karyotyping are provided by both the European Leukemia Net (ELN) and the Medical Research Council (MRC). Complex aberrant, monosomal and abnl(17p) karyotypes confer a poor prognosis. In cytogenetic studies, chromosome aberrations that cannot be identified due to gross rearrangement, thereby preventing the allocation to a specific chromosome, are designated as \"Marker Chromosomes\" (MC). The significance of MC as prognostic factor for AML has remained elusive so far. In this study we have assessed frequency, cytogenetic characteristics and prognostic impact of MC as well as their underlying biological origin. Given the gross structural chromosomal damage inherent to MC we speculated that they may arise from chromothripsis, a recently described phenomenon of chromosome fragmentation in a single catastrophic event. Patients and Methods: Patients recruited intwo large consecutive, prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trials for newly diagnosed non-M3 AML patients from the German Study Alliance Leukemia (SAL) were analyzed (AML96, NCT00180115; AML2003, NCT00180102). All karyotypes were retrospectively screened for MC. For the detection of chromothripsis array-CGH was used. For each sample 50 ng of DNA were hybridized to an Affymetrix\u00ae CytoScan HD Oligo/SNP-array and scanned with the Affymetrix GeneChip\u00ae Scanner 3000 7G. Chromothripsis was defined according to the criteria of Rausch et al., which require at least 10 switches in segmental copy number involving two or three distinct copy number states on a single chromosome. Results: MC were detectable in 165/1026 (16.1%) of aberrant non-CBF karyotype cases. Adverse-risk karyotypes displayed a higher frequency of MC (40.3% in complex aberrant, 26.5% in adverse-risk as defined by MRC criteria and 41.2% in abnl(17p) karyotypes, p<.001 each). MC were associated with a poorer prognosis compared to other non-CBF aberrant karyotypes as well as with lower remission rates (CR+CRi; 36.0% vs. 55.8% in AML96 \u226460 years, p=0.01; 14.3% vs. 44.1% in AML2003, p<0.001), inferior event-free survival (2.24 vs. 6.54 months, p<0.001; 3.45 vs. 8.03 months, p<0.001) and overall survival (5.72 vs. 11.87 months, p<0.001; 8.68 vs. 20.78, p=0.01). In multivariate analysis with co-variables age, prior MDS, therapy-related AML and adverse-risk cytogenetics according to MRC criteria, MC independently predicted poor prognosis in AML96 \u226460 years but not in AML2003 with its higher allogeneic transplantation rate. As detected by array-CGH, in about one third of MC karyotypes (18/49, 36.7%, including 3 cases with 8 or 9 copy number switches) MC had arisen from chromothripsis, whereas this phenomenon was virtually undetectable in a control group of complex aberrant karyotypes without MC (1/34) (p<0.001). Chromothripsis in MC karyotypes typically involved one single chromosome (n=11), with two or three chromosomes affected in 5 and 2 patients, respectively. There was no predilection for a particular chromosome. MC karyotypes positive for chromothripsis were characterized by a particularly high degree of karyotype complexity as compared to those that were negative for chromothripsis (complex aberrant 100% vs. 64.5% p<0.01; abnl(17p) 50.0% vs. 16.1%, p=0.01). In 12/18 (66.7%) cases, at least one of the chromothriptic chromosomes was reported as loss in the karyotype formula, suggesting that the grouping of a chromothriptic chromosome as a marker is paralleled by a putative loss of the affected chromosome. The chromothripsis positive MC karyotype subgroup had a particularly dismal prognosis with a combined CR+CRi rate of 2/16 vs. 10/31 (p=0.14). It also displayed inferior event-free and overall survival, though statistical significance was not reached for either endpoint, likely due to the already poor prognosis of the entire MC positive group. Conclusion: This is the first study showing that MC are a frequent finding predominantly in adverse-risk AML and associated with particularly poor prognosis. Our data provide evidence that a substantial portion of MC arise from chromothripsis. Disclosures Thiede: AgenDix: Employment, Other: Ownership.",
