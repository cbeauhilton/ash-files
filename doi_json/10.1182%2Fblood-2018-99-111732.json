    "abstract_text": "Background and Aim: Treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is the standard of care for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Based on the results of the ENESTnd and DASISION studies, the European LeukemiaNet 2013 guidelines now recommend the use of TKIs, imatinib (400 mg once daily), nilotinib (300 mg twice daily), and dasatinib (100 mg once daily) as first-line treatment for patients with CML in the chronic phase (CML-CP). Compared to imatinib, the new generation TKIs, nilotinib and dasatinib, were found to have deeper and faster treatment response rates with acceptable toxicities. However, a direct comparison between nilotinib and dasatinib has never been reported previously. Our study aims to compare the outcomes and molecular responses achieved following the first-line use of these two agents in patients with CML-CP. Patients and Methods: The database of the CML Cooperative Study Group, which includes patients who were initially diagnosed with CML after the introduction of imatinib (April 2001), was reviewed, and patients who were given nilotinib or dasatinib as first-line therapy were identified. The event-free survival (EFS, defined as the loss of treatment efficacy, disease progression, or any cause of death), and rates of cumulative major molecular response (MMR), and deep molecular response (DMR, defined as the depth of MR 4.5) were compared between the nilotinib and dasatinib groups. Further, the predictive ability of the Sokal, Hasford, and European Treatment and Outcome Study (EUTOS) scoring systems for the achievement of molecular responses was also evaluated. For the analysis of molecular responses, patients who switched from their initial treatment agent to another TKI before achievement of MMR or DMR were considered to have no MMR or DMR. Results and Discussion: Out of 361 patients with CML-CP enrolled in our database, 58 and 63 were treated with conventional doses of nilotinib (300 mg twice daily) and dasatinib (100 mg once daily), respectively, as first-line therapy. Patients who had been started on a low dose TKI therapy were excluded from this analysis. The patient demographics, including age, sex, observation periods, and the Sokal, Hasford, and EUTOS scores did not show significant differences between the groups. In total, there were five events during the observation period (1 in the nilotinib group and 4 in the dasatinib group), and all events were deaths unrelated to CML, except for one in a patient in the dasatinib group who showed loss of complete cytogenetic response. The disease did not progress to the accelerated or blastic phase in any of the cases. The EFS did not differ between these two groups ( p = 0.214). The MMR rates by 6, 12, 18, and 24 months were 59%, 72%, 74%, and 81%, respectively, in the nilotinib group and 52%, 73%, 81%, and 86%, respectively, in the dasatinib group. The DMR rates by 6, 12, 18, and 24 months was 7%, 17%, 24%, and 28%, respectively, in the nilotinib group and 3%, 16%, 25%, and 29%, respectively, in the dasatinib group. During the first 24 months of treatment, 4 (7%) patients in the nilotinib group and 11 (17%) in the dasatinib group had been switched to other TKIs (p = 0.0983). Among the three scoring systems, only the Hasford score could predict the achievement of DMR, and all of them failed to predict the achievement of MMR in the entire cohort. Our data suggest that both nilotinib and dasatinib have comparable efficacies, with high molecular response rates and promising outcomes. The validity of our findings should be tested in a randomized study, which is currently underway in Japan.
