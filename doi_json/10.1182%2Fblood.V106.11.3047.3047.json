    "abstract_text": "Correction of a disease gene mutation by homologous recombination (HR) with a transfected DNA repair template represents an ideal form of gene therapy for many inherited hematological disorders. Therapeutic gene correction via HR in hematopoietic stem cells is unlikely to succeed, however, without major improvements in its efficiency. One promising approach is to use an engineered zinc finger endonuclease to specifically cleave the target gene and so promote HR between a dsDNA template and its chromosomal target (Urnov et al (2005) Nature 435:646-51). We are exploring an alternative approach based on the expression of Red\u03b2, a single stranded (ss) DNA annealing protein from bacteriophage \u03bb. In bacteria, Red\u03b2 promotes HR-mediated gene modification using templates with short regions of homology (e.g. 30\u2013100nt). Such HR is independent of RecA-mediated host cell HR. For double stranded (ds) DNA templates, co-expression of \u03bb exonuclease (the red \u03b1 gene product) is required, but ssDNA templated modifications are particularly efficient and require only Red\u03b2 expression. Such properties could be useful for therapeutic gene correction if reproduced in human cells. Preliminary experiments in mouse embryonic stem cells suggested that Red\u03b2 can function in mammalian cells (Zhang Y. et al, (2003) BMC Mol. Biol. 4). To explore this further, we have generated a human cell line in which large amounts of Red\u03b2 can be expressed inducibly in the nucleus. In contrast to the over-expression of endogenous HR proteins Rad51 (RecA homologue) or Rad52 (ssDNA annealing protein), sustained Red\u03b2 over-expression is well tolerated, with no impairment of cell proliferation or viability. We find that Red\u03b2 does indeed promote HR in human cells. Surprisingly, dsDNA and ssDNA templated gene modification are stimulated to similar extents by Red\u03b2. Stimulations are modest, but similar to those achieved by human Rad51 over-expression. The effects of co-expressing Red \u03b1 are under investigation. We have also shown that ssDNA-templated gene correction is stimulated by transient, RNAi-mediated, depletion of the mismatch repair protein MSH2, and that such stimulation is additive with Red\u03b2-stimulated gene correction.",
