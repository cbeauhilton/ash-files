    "abstract_text": "Leukemia is the most common childhood cancer, and while outcomes for most children have improved significantly, the prognosis in infant leukemia remains dire. The majority of infant leukemia, either acute myeloid (AML) or acute lymphoid (ALL), is caused by reciprocal translocations of the MLL-gene. Prior studies show that one of the most consistently overexpressed genes in these leukemias (compared to all other leukemias) is the RNA binding protein muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1). We found that MBNL1 knockdown significantly impairs propagation of MLL-rearranged (MLLr) leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo using human cell lines and transformed murine cells. To further characterize the role of MBNL1 in acute leukemia, we performed shRNA knockdown experiments in MLLr and non-MLLr leukemia cell lines and in primary patient samples. While MBNL1 knockdown does also impair growth of non-MLLr leukemic cells, the effect is less pronounced. In a 5-day growth experiment MBNL1-knockdown MLLr cells (THP-1) displayed a median 71% reduced growth compared to controls, whereas non-MLLr cells (HL-60) displayed only a median 32% growth reduction (p=0.0001). Cells from two patients with MLLr AML (one with MLL-AF9 and one with MLL-AF10 fusion) underwent shNT (non-targeting) or shMBNL1 transduction.. Unsorted cells were transplanted into NSGS mice. Mice were observed until showing signs of distress and then analyzed for engraftment of human cells and abundance of transduced cells (venus-positive). In the shNT group there was robust persistence of transduced cells (7%-98% of human cells), whereas shMBNL1-transduced cells were not detected or comprised <1% of human cells in most of the recipient mice. Given that MBNL1 is known to regulate alternative splicing, we used unbiased RNAseq along with a novel analytic splice-junction and intron-quantification toolkit (AltAnalyze) to determine splicing changes induced by knockdown of MBNL1 in the MLLr leukemia cell line MOLM-13. In a parallel analysis, we determined splicing differences between MLLr and cytogenetically-normal (CN) AML patient samples. We then compared these two results to determine the splicing events regulated by MBNL1 and assess the contribution of MBNL1 to splicing events observed in primary MLLr leukemias. Strikingly, this comparative analysis found that 88% of overlapping differentially expressed splicing events (75 out of 85) were concordant between patient MLLr and CN-AML as compared to control versus MBNL1 knockdown. The most common class of splicing event that occurred with MBNL1 knockdown was intron retention. Specifically, our findings suggest that MBNL1 knockdown restores intron retention, and that MBNL1 overexpression promotes expression of protein-coding genes that would otherwise be suppressed through intron retention-introduced premature termination codons. Several genes whose transcripts are alternatively spliced by MBNL1 have prior associations with cancer, most notably DOT1L and SETD1A which are specifically implicated in MLLr leukemia. Splicing validation through RT-PCR confirmed increased intron retention in DOT1L and SETD1A transcripts after MBNL1 knockdown. Interestingly, one target of MBNL1 is the MBNL1 mRNA itself, with resultant exclusion of exon 5. MBNL1 lacking exon 5 has a stronger affinity to RNA. In summary, our data suggests that MBNL1 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of MLL-fusion leukemia, wherein it stabilizes the transcripts of multiple leukemogenic genes including DOT1L and SETD1A. Proteins such as DOT1L are critical for transcriptional activation of downstream targets of the MLL-fusion protein (including activation of MBNL1, creating a positive feedback loop). Additionally, high levels of MBNL1 protein may alter splicing in ways that enhance MBNL1 functionality. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
