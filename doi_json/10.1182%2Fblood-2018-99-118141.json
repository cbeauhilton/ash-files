    "abstract_text": "Background: Immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) has been an important prognostic factor for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) for decades. 98% being a cut-off value for IGHV is a mathematical choice and researches on the best cut-off value have never been stopped. Chinese CLL patients are known to differ from Caucasian CLL patients on both clinical and genetical features. However, the optimal cutoff for IGHV mutational status has not yet been studied in this particular ethnic group. Method: We carried out a study on 595 Chinese CLL patients in order to find out whether 98% is the best cut-off value for IGHV in Chinese CLL patients. Genomic DNA from peripheral blood or bone marrow was subjected to PCR amplification following the IGH Somatic Hypermutation Assay v2.0 protocol (InVivoScribe). Sequences were aligned to ImMunoGeneTics/V-QUEry and Standardization (IMGT/-VQUEST) database. Result: 600 sequences were received after IGHV rearrangement sequencing. IGHV3-23, IGHV4-34, IGHV3-7, IGHV4-39 and IGHV1-69 were the most frequently used IGHV genes. 352 (58.7%) cases were IGHV-mutated while 248 (41.3%) cases were IGHV-unmutated if the classical 98% classification by ERIC was used. In order to determine the optimal cut-off value, we used 1% as the interval to divide the entire cohort into 7 groups according to the mutational rate, which were <95%, 95%-95.99%, 96%-96.99%, 97%-97.99%, 98%-98.99%, 99%-99.99% and 100% respectively. Binet A patients had a relatively indolent course of disease and cases with different IGHV mutational rates had no significant differences in time to first treatment (TTFT) apart from truly unmutated (100%) cases. For the whole study cohort, significant difference appeared at 98% interval (P<0.001 and P=0.005 for TTFT and OS respectively) while intervals less than 98% had no significant difference compared with the <95% group. Similarly, there was no clear dissimilarities among 98%, 99% and 100% intervals (Table 1a and b). All the other prognostic factors including del(17p), del(11q), TP53 mutation, MYD88 mutation, NOTCH1 mutation, SF3B1 mutation, CD38, ZAP-70, Binet staging, gender, \u03b22-microglobulin and EBV-DNA were differently distributed between group <98% and group \u00b398%, but not among subgroups in \u00b398%. In multivariate analysis, the 98% IGHV was also an independent prognostic factor for TTFT and OS. Conclusion: 98% is the optimal cutoff value for IGHV mutational status to predict the prognosis of CLL patients in China. Table 1. View large Download slide Table 1.
