    "abstract_text": "Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (PTLD), an EBV-driven lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD), represents a life-threatening challenge for patients (pts) following solid organ transplant (SOT) or hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Though some pts will respond to reduction of immunosuppression or rituximab therapy, failure of rituximab-based 1st line therapy predicts a dismal prognosis in post-HCT PTLD pts with a median overall survival (OS) of 16-56 days. In SOT-associated PTLD, pts failing rituximab experience increased chemotherapy-induced treatment-related mortality compared to other lymphoma pts. EBV-CTLs have previously been shown to induce durable responses in pts with SOT- or HCT-associated PTLD despite rituximab failure. Here we report interim study results for using ATA129, an allogeneic off-the-shelf EBV-CTL cell product derived from volunteer donors, for pts with HCT- or SOT-associated PTLD treated on EBV CTL 201, a multicenter expanded access protocol (EAP) for pts with EBV-driven diseases. Methods: Eligible pts were those with EBV+ PTLD, other EBV-driven malignancies, EBV+ hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), or EBV viremia; adequate organ function; adequate performance status; and measurable disease who provided informed consent. Enrollment is ongoing. Pts are treated with partially HLA-matched ATA129 sharing \u22652 HLA alleles with the pt, at least one of which is an HLA allele through which ATA129 exerts cytotoxicity (referred to as HLA restriction). The dose of ATA129 is 1.6-2 x 10^6 cells/kg on days 1, 8, and 15 of every 35d cycle. Pts undergo radiographic, biochemical (HLH), or virologic assessment at ~day 28 of each cycle Pts with progressive disease after 1 cycle may undergo Switch Therapy to an ATA129 product with a different HLA restriction. Objective response rate (ORR) is determined radiographically and represents the best response observed across all ATA129 lots received for any given pt. Results: Ten PTLD pts received ATA129 and have sufficient follow-up to assess response (efficacy population): 5 PTLD pts post-HCT; 5 PTLD pts post-SOT. For SOT-PTLD, the objective response rate (ORR) is 100%; for HCT-PTLD, the ORR is 80%. An additional 2 PTLD pts have received ATA129 but are too early to assess. For these 12 PTLD pts, median age was 27 (range 7-58); median number of ATA129 cycles was 2 (range 1-8); median follow-up was 3.3 months (range 1-12 months) and median number of ATA129 cell product lots per pt was 1 (range 1 - 5). An additional 10 pts with various non-PTLD EBV+ diagnoses are included in the safety population only. Treatment-related treatment-emergent serious AEs have been reported in 5 of the 22 treated pts (2 PTLD and 3 non-PTLD pts). However, in this generally ill population, the only safety signal observed was tumor flare in 1 patient. Conclusions: ATA129 provided a high response rate in the PTLD population (80-100%) in the multicenter EAP EBV-CTL-201, consistent with prior reports for single institution studies. A low number of related SAEs was observed across different diagnoses on EBV-CTL-201. Updated safety and efficacy data will be presented at the meeting.
