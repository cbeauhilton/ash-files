    "abstract_text": "Aim: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), particularly the multidrug-resistant (MDR) GVHD, is one of the most important complications for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) recipients. The purpose of our study is to identify the efficacy of ruxolitinib in allo-HSCT recipients with MDR-GVHD. Methods: A total of 44 patients who received ruxolitinib treatment for MDR-GVHD after allo-HSCT between 2017 and 2019 were enrolled in this study (HLA-identical sibling donors: n=10; HLA-haploidentical related donors: n=34). MDR-GVHD was defined as GVHD showing no improvement after at least 3 types of treatments. Patients were treated with ruxolitinib as an add-on immunosuppression therapy at a dose of 5 mg orally twice daily, and it could be increased to 10mg twice daily if hematologic parameters were stable and no treatment-related toxicities were observed after the first 7 days of treatment. This work was supported by the Capital's Funds for Health Improvement and Research (grant number 2018-4-4089). Results: The median number of previous GVHD-therapies was 4 for both MDR-aGVHD and MDR-cGVHD. For MDR-aGVHD (n=16), the median time to response was 10 days (range, 2 to 65), and the overall response rate (ORR) was 62.5% (10/16) in, including 37.5% (6/16) complete response (CR) and 25.0% (4/16) partial response (PR). Patients with 3 organs involvement had a lower ORR compared to that of those with 1-2 organs involvements (88.9% vs 28.6%, P =0.035). The 1-year probability of overall survival after ruxolitinib was 62.1%. The rates of hematologic and infectious toxicities were 75.0% and 50.0% after ruxolitinib treatment. For MDR-cGVHD (n=28), the median time to response was 30 days (range, 6 to 270), and the ORR was 78.6% (22/28), including 28.6% (8/28) CR and 50% (14/28) PR. The 1-year probability of overall survival after ruxolitinib was 90.0%. The rates of hematologic and infectious toxicities were 46.4% and 42.9% after ruxolitinib treatment. Conclusions: Ruxolitinib is an effective and safe salvage treatment for both MDR-aGVHD and MDR-cGVHD in allo-HSCT recipients. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
