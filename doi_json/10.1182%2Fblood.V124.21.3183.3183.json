    "abstract_text": "Background : Myelofibrosis (MF), polycythemia vera (PV), and essential thrombocythemia (ET), are chronic MPNs associated with a broad array of symptoms that may negatively impact patients\u2019 quality of life (QoL). To enhance patient care, it is important to have a current and clear understanding of how MPNs affect the overall health and daily lives of patients. The MPN LANDMARK SURVEY was developed to examine patients\u2019 perceptions of these MPNs related to disease burden, QoL, productivity, and activities of daily living (ADLs). Methods : Eligible patients diagnosed with an MPN were recruited to participate in an online survey conducted from May\u2013July 2014in the US. Patients were asked about the overall burden of disease and impact of symptoms on their QoL, productivity, and ADLs. Descriptive analyses were conducted to assess these outcomes and examined by calculated (not reported) prognostic risk score (MF - DIPSS: Passamonti, Blood 2010; PV: Tefferi, Leuk 2013; ET - IPSET: Passamonti, Blood 2012) and symptom severity quartiles, which were determined using the MPN Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF) total symptom scores. Results : 813 patients (MF=207; PV=380; ET=226) responded to the survey. A majority of patients were female (MF, 54%; PV, 62%; ET, 72%), approximately half were aged 60\u201374 years (MF, 55%; PV, 51%; ET, 46%), and most were covered by health insurance (>98%). Nearly half (48%) were diagnosed within the last 5 years and average time to diagnosis from first symptoms was >2 years. A high proportion of patients had intermediate to high prognostic risk scores (MF, 94%; PV, 87%; ET, 44%). The majority of patients reported feeling anxious or worried about their MPN (MF, 91%; PV, 78%; ET, 74%). Among all groups, fatigue was the most severe symptom reported (mean MPN-SAF score=6.0\u20136.4 on a scale of 0\u201310). A subset of patients in each group described their symptoms as very severe (severity score \u22657 on a scale of 0\u201310; MF: fatigue [59%], problems with sexual desire [49%], inactivity [46%]; PV: inactivity [48%], fatigue [49%], problems with sexual desire [49%]; and ET: problems with sexual desire [49%], fatigue [50%], headaches [40%]). The majority of patients reported that MPN-related symptoms reduced their QoL (MF, 81%; PV, 66%; ET, 57%); this was reported in all risk groups but more frequently by patients with a high risk score vs a low risk score in MF and ET (MF, 89% vs 69%; PV, 63% vs 65%; ET, 71% vs 59%). A more substantial QoL impact was reported by patients in high vs low symptom quartiles (MF, 95% vs 51%; PV, 94% vs 33%; ET, 93% vs 15%). Similarly, MPNs also had a marked negative impact on reduced work hours, sick days, voluntary job termination, receipt of medical disability, early retirement, and ADLs (Table 1) . For example, among patients employed, approximately one fourth reported missing \u22651 day of work (MF, 29%; PV, 19%; ET, 23%) in the last 30 days before the survey. Even patients with low prognostic risk scores often reported missing \u22651 day of work (MF, 33%; PV, 23%; ET, 22%) or cancelling \u22651 day of planned activities (MF, 46%; PV, 35%; ET, 34%). Patients in the high vs low symptom quartiles were more likely to call in sick to work (MF, 48% vs 0%; PV, 52% vs 4%; ET, 38% vs 0%) or cancel \u22651 day of planned activities (MF, 77% vs 5%; PV, 56% vs 7%; ET, 67% vs 3%). Conclusion : The findings from this large, first-of-its-kind survey demonstrate a marked burden of disease across all 3 MPNs that is not limited to symptoms but extends to QoL, productivity, and ADLs. Although high prognostic risk scores have long been associated with a significant burden of disease, in this study, patients with a low risk score also reported significant burden. The symptom burden reported is consistent with previous studies, thus validating the present dataset. MPN treatment considerations should include reducing the symptom burden and improving QoL and productivity to enhance the overall health and lives of MPN patients.
