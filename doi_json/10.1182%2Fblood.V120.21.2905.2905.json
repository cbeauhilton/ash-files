    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2905 Background Bendamustine, a unique alkylating agent with a multifaceted mechanism of action is effective front-line therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In vitro studies showing that cytotoxic activity of bendamustine against CLL-derived cell lines is synergized by rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, have led to investigation of combination bendamustine plus rituximab (BR) as first-line therapy and treatment of relapsed disease. This retrospective analysis assessed real-world efficacy and safety of bendamustine alone and combined with rituximab in treatment-nai\u0308ve CLL patients from Projektgruppe Internistische Onkologie, the largest registry of treatment data from private medical oncology practices in Germany. Methods Records were obtained for all CLL patients in a registry from 57 German oncology practices from May 2008 to July 2011. Patients who received \u22653 cycles of first-line bendamustine monotherapy or BR were divided into the following age/treatment groups: \u226460 years treated with BR \u00b1 prednisone (P) [\u2264 60 BR ]; >60 to <70 years treated with bendamustine monotherapy [ 60\u201370 B ]; >60 to <70 years treated with BR \u00b1 P [ 60\u201370 BR ]; \u226570 years treated with bendamustine monotherapy [\u2265 70 B ]; and \u226570 years treated with BR \u00b1 P [\u2265 70 BR ]. The primary efficacy measure was ORR (complete response [CR] plus partial response [PR]); secondary efficacy measures included CR, PR, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Adverse events (AEs) were assessed. Results A total 217 patients (\u226561.1% male in each group) were included in the analysis (Table). At diagnosis, all patients had an ECOG score of 0\u20132; most had RAI stage 0-II (16 had stage III/IV) and Binet stage A or B (29 had stage C). Mean number of treatment cycles (28 days/cycle) per group ranged from 5.1 to 5.9. Mean dose per cycle ranged from 133.6 to 165.9 mg/m 2 for bendamustine and 391.1 to 412.1 mg/m 2 for rituximab in those groups (Table). Median follow-up was 3 years (range 1\u20135). Observed ORRs were >83% in all groups (Table); 1 patient each in the 60\u201370 B and 60\u201370 BR groups had progressive disease, and 1 in the \u2265 70 BR group was not assessable. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, median PFS and OS have been reached in the 60\u201370 B (PFS: 14.8 months, OS: 41.0 months) and \u2265 70 B (PFS: 32.5 months, OS: 40.1 months) groups only. PFS results are shown in the Figure. There were 26 deaths at the time of analysis. The most common grade 3/4 hematologic AEs were febrile neutropenia (n=28) in the \u2265 70 BR group, leukopenia (n=15) in the \u2264 60 BR group, and leukopenia (n=25) in the \u2265 70 BR group. Depression was the most common grade 3/4 nonhematologic AE, affecting all patients in the \u2264 60 BR and 60\u201370 B groups, 48/50 patients in the 60\u201370 BR group, 35/36 in the \u2265 70 B, and 94/95 in the \u2265 70 BR . Other common grade 3/4 nonhematologic AEs included fatigue (2 patients in \u2265 70 BR and 1 patient each in 60\u201370 B and \u2265 70 B ) and infections/infestations (2 patients in \u2264 60 BR and 3 in \u2265 70 BR) . Thirty patients were hospitalized (Table). Dose reductions were most frequent in the \u2265 70 B group (67%) and least in the 60\u201370 B and 60\u201370 BR groups (17% and 12.0%, respectively) (Table). Dose delays occurred for 1 patient each in the \u2264 60 BR, 60\u201370 B, and \u2265 70 BR groups and 4 patients in the \u2265 70 B group. Conclusions Data from this real-world chart review indicate that bendamustine alone or with rituximab provides high response rates and an acceptable safety profile with low rates of dose delay in all patient age groups (\u226460, 60\u201370, and \u226570) with previously untreated CLL. These findings are similar to those reported in large clinical trials. Table  . < 60 BR n=24 . 60\u201370 B n=12 . 60\u201370 BR n=50 . > 70 B n=36 . > 70 BR n=95 .
