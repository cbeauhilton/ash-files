    "abstract_text": "Background: In ZUMA-1, the pivotal study of axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) in patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), Grade \u22653 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events (NEs) occurred in 13% and 28% of patients, respectively, and required intensive in-patient management (Neelapu, et al. NEJM. 2017;377:2531). With increased safety experience, the management of CRS and NEs has been under evaluation in several exploratory safety management cohorts of ZUMA-1. Cohort 4 evaluated levetiracetam prophylaxis and earlier corticosteroid and/or tocilizumab use on the incidence and severity of CRS and NEs (Topp, et al. Br J Haematol. 2021. In press). The impact of adding prophylactic corticosteroids to the Cohort 4 toxicity management regimen was assessed in Cohort 6 (Oluwole, et al. Br J Haematol. 2021). Notably, some treated patients have early versus late onset of CRS or NEs, warranting distinct management. To facilitate toxicity management, we developed predictive algorithms for early onset acute toxicities (within 3-4 days after axi-cel) based on machine learning from ZUMA-1 data. Methods: This post hoc analysis included patients from ZUMA-1 Phase 1 and Phase 2 Cohorts 1, 2, 4, and 6. Covariates (>1500; 227 measured before axi-cel infusion) included baseline product, patient and tumor characteristics, and proinflammatory soluble blood biomarker levels. Data from patients in Cohorts 1, 2, and 4 were randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. Univariate and multivariate analyses and clinical feasibility considerations were applied to select a covariate subset for further analysis. Machine learning (eg, logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and AdaBoost classifier) was applied to 3 categories of covariates (1, clinical; 2, mechanistic [eg, product attributes, inflammatory blood biomarkers]; 3, hybrid of 1 and 2) to build best-performing models (predictive performance evaluated by area under the curve [AUC] on test data). Optimal cutoffs for predictive scores were selected by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) or classification tree analysis. Data from patients in Cohort 6 were included to validate the best-performing model generated using training data. Results: Multivariate analysis and machine learning from data obtained from 149 evaluable patients in ZUMA-1 Cohorts 1, 2, and 4 led to several comparable predictive models for early onset CRS or NEs (best-performing models with ROC AUC >0.8 in training and >0.7 in testing). The covariates in best-performing models included product cell viability, centrally measured Day 0 (before axi-cel treatment) IL-15 and CCL2 serum levels and locally measured blood cell counts, blood chemistry analytes, tumor burden, and serum lactate dehydrogenase level. Best-performing models with 0.7 in testing) to larger best-performing models. Classification trees with splitting based on Day 0 IL-15 and product cell viability showed a potential to categorize patients by early versus late onset of toxicities (specificity >0.85). Conclusions: Machine learning applied to covariates measured before axi-cel infusion yielded predictive models for early onset CRS or NEs that can be used for toxicity prediction, monitoring, and management. High performing hybrid or mechanistic models corroborated the importance of T-cell viability (product cell fitness) and conditioning-related elevation of factors (IL-15 and CCL2) that influence toxicities. This algorithm may be further optimized in the context of improved toxicity management and by introducing monitoring of vitals early posttreatment.
