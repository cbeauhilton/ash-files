    "abstract_text": "While hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) represents the only curative therapy for sickle cell disease, sickle patients undergoing HSCT face many complications, including an increased risk of graft rejection compared to non-sickle patients. We have used the Berkeley sickle mouse model to study the potential mechanisms underlying this increased risk of rejection. Using a CD28/CD40 costimulation-blockade-based non-myeloablative HSCT regimen, we transplanted Berkeley sickle mice with fully allogeneic SJL bone marrow. While the vast majority (>85%, n=25) of control C57BL/6 animals became stably chimeric and immunologically donor-tolerant with this transplant regimen, sickle mice were much more prone to reject the transplant (~20% graft acceptance, n=25). Both CD8+ cells and NK1.1+ cells were found to contribute to this rejection, as depletion of either of these cell populations led to a marked increase in the percent of engrafted mice (>85% graft acceptance, n=15\u201325), while depletion of CD4+ cells led to the opposite effect, with 0% (n=25) animals engrafted in this depletion cohort. The increased propensity of HSCT rejection in the Berkeley sickle mice may, in part, be explained by the presence of increased numbers of donor-reactive T cells (5\u201310-fold compared to C57BL/6 controls) in nai\u0308ve sickle mice, despite their lack of exposure to donor antigens, and their housing in a Specific-Pathogen-Free environment. We speculate that these increased numbers of anti-donor T cells may occur as a result of heightened inflammation in the context of active sickle cell disease, which could lead to increased expansion and persistence of a T cell repertoire containing anti-donor heterologous T cell immunity. This heterologous immunity may have a profound effect on the success of HSCT for sickle cell disease, especially when non-myeloablative regimens are employed."
