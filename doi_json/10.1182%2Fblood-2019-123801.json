    "abstract_text": "Background: Patients with r/r tumor stage CTCL and/or PTCL have a poor prognosis. BV is currently FDA approved for CD30 positive CTCL and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) with single agent activity in additional PTCL subtypes. Len also has single agent activity in patients with r/r CTCL/PTCL. The safety of the combination was established in a phase I trial in patients with r/r diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Methods: We conducted a single-institution phase II trial to determine the safety and efficacy of BV+Len combination in patients with r/r CTCL/PTCL. Simon's 2-stage optimal design was followed to test the null hypothesis of overall response rate (ORR) \u22640.3 versus the alternative hypothesis of ORR\u22650.5. Patients with \u2265 1 line of systemic therapy or 2 lines of skin directed therapy, at least stage IB (for CTCL), and no prior progression on BV were eligible regardless of CD30 staining. All patients were treated with BV 1.2 mg/kg IV and Len 20 mg PO daily q3 weeks for a maximum 16 cycles. After 7 patients were treated, we reduced Len to 10 mg given safety/tolerability concerns. Responses are assessed by the International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas and the cutaneous lymphoma task force of the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (ISCL/EORTC) Global response criteria (for CTCL) and Cheson year criteria (for PTCL). The effect of treatment on quality of life is assessed by Skindex-16. Results: As of July 1, 2019, 17 subjects were treated; 10 (59%) with mycosis fungoides (MF), 2 (12%) with Sezary syndrome (SS), 2 (12%) with CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorder, and 3 (18%) with PTCL. Median age was 60 (49-90) years and 76% were males. CD30 was completely negative (50% reduction in their Skindex-16 scores after a median of 2 cycles (range 1-3). Conclusions: BV + Len is combination is safe and efficacious in a heavily pre-treated patients with T-cell lymphomas. Len doses higher than 10 mg daily are poorly tolerated and associated with excess tumor flare. Recruitment of both CTCL and PTCL patients for this trial is ongoing.
