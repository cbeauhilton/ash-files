    "abstract_text": "Introduction There are 827 variants of \u03b2 thalassemia reported to the registry of human hemoglobin variants and thalassemias registry 1 . Genetic mutations of \u03b2 thalassemia are very diverse but can be broadly divided in to non deletion forms and deletion forms. The new mutation is a frame shift insertion in exon 2 of the \u03b2 globin gene. To the best of our knowledge this mutation has never been described before and presents as a mild form \u03b2 thalassemia intermedia. Objective To describe the phenotypic presentation of the new \u03b2 globin variant, due to insertion of 9 nucleotides (AAAGTGCTC) between nucleotides c.207 and c.208. Case report A 22 months-old Hispanic boy who was referred for evaluation of persistent anemia. The new born screening for the child was positive for sickle cell trait. Initial hemoglobin (Hb) was 8.8, hematocrit was 27 and MCV was 65.5, which were decreased. RDW was 25.2, which was increased. Hemoglobin evaluation by acid and alkaline electrophoresis and HPLC revealed a HbS 0%, HbF 6.5% HbA 78.4%, HbA 2 4.9% and a Hb variant 10.2%. The interpretation of the results was an \u03b1 globin variant suggestive of Hb Montefiore and \u03b2 thalassemia trait. Alpha thalassemia PCR for the 7 most common deletions in the \u03b1 globin chain was negative. Subsequent \u03b1 globin gene sequencing revealed no \u03b1 globin gene mutations. On physical exam there were no bony changes or hepatosplenomegaly. Family History The mother is 29-year-old with HbAA. The father is 39-years-old with the same mutation on beta globin gene analysis. Hb electrophoresis also suggested an \u03b1 and \u03b2 globin mutation. Alpha thalassemia PCR was negative and he had a normal \u03b1 globin gene copy number. At age 19 he had a splenectomy secondary to splenomegaly and hypersplenism. He is consistently anemic with Hb< 9 and MCV < 70. The child has a paternal half brother, who is 21 years old and has similar problems as father. He had a splenectomy at the age of 17 after admission for abdominal pain. The patient has a 5-year-old sibling, who is normal with HbAA and another paternal half sibling reported as no anemia. Discussion Though \u03b2 thalassemia intermedia is most commonly homozygous or compound heterozygous, less frequently it can be due to single locus mutation. DNA sequencing of the \u03b1 globin gene of the index case was completely normal and there was normal copy number of the \u03b1 globin gene in the father. No Hb S was found on Hb electrophoresis. The new mutation adds 9 base pairs to exon 2 and 3 amino acids (Lys-Val-Leu) between amino acid 68 and 69 of the protein. This elongates the beta chain which can lead to instability and precipitation of Hb as well as hemolysis and anemia 2 . Further studies like short time incubation and pulse chase globin chain synthesis experiments are needed to know the stability of the \u03b2 globin protein 3 . In addition, an increase of \u03b1 globin gene copy number can also be a reason for increasing the severity of \u03b2 thalassemia trait 2 . However the \u03b1 gene copy was normal in the father. Conclusion We present a case of a child with a false positive abnormal newborn screen suggestive of sickle cell trait, as well as a Hb electrophoresis suggestive of an alpha globin mutation. As the father and paternal brother have had a splenectomy in their teen years with noted hepatosplenomegaly, suggestive of increased hemolysis, and the anemia is more severe than usual for \u03b2 thalassemia trait, this suggests that phenotypically the c.199_207dup variant presents as a mild \u03b2 thalassemia intermedia. In addition, there does not seem to be any bony abnormalities associated with marrow hyperplasia. As both our patients are heterozygous for this novel mutation with normal \u03b1 globin gene copy number and alpha globin sequencing, we suspect that elongation of the \u03b2 globin produces an unstable hemoglobin with a mild \u03b2 thalassemia intermedia phenotype 2 .
