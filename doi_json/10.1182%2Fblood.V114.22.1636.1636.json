    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1636 Poster Board I-662 Human plasma cells (PCs) and their precursors play an essential role in humoral immune response, but are rare and difficult to harvest. We report here i) the generation of human syndecan-1 + and immunoglobulin secreting PCs starting from memory B cells (MBCs) in a 3-step- and 10-day (D) culture, including a 6-fold cell amplification. ii) We report the detailed phenotypic and Affymetrix gene expression profiles of these in vitro PCs as well as of intermediate cells - activated B cells (actBCs) and plasmablasts (PBs) - compared to MBCs and bone marrow PCs, which is accessible through an open web ATLAS ( http://amazonia.transcriptome.eu/ ). iii) We show this B cell to PC differentiation to involve IRF4 and AICDA expression in D4 actBCs, decrease of PAX5 and BCL6 expressions and increase in PRDM1 and XBP1 expressions in D7 PBs and D10 PCs. It involves downregulation of genes controlled by Pax5, induction of genes controlled by Blimp-1 and XBP1 (unfold protein response). iv) The phenotype of D10 PCs resembles that of peripheral blood PCs detected after immunization of healthy donors. This in vitro model will facilitate further studies in PC biology. It will likewise be helpful to study plasma-cell dyscrasias, including Multiple Myeloma.
