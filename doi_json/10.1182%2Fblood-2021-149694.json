However, little evidence exists whether having a history of cancer plays a significant role in these observations. Patients with hematologic malignancy (HM) might have worse prognosis among all cancer patients but the reason remains unclear. Our objective is to evaluate outcomes and severity of COVID-19 in patients with Hematological Malignancy (HM) versus Solid-tumors (ST) in different clinical settings and also compare these outcomes within the group of patients with hematological malignancies. Methods: This retrospective study examines risk factors and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with a history of cancer and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis between March 1 st , 2020, and December 31 st , 2020, at Rush University Medical Center, one of the largest COVID-19 tertiary care hospitals in Chicago. Baseline characteristics, malignancy type and types of cancer treatment within the last 30 days were recorded. Measures of COVID-19 severity included hospital admission versus outpatient care, use of oxygen, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mechanical ventilation. The primary outcome was death. Statistical analysis was conducted using optimal discriminant analysis, a non-parametric exact machine-learning algorithm which identifies the relationship between independent and dependent variables that maximizes model predictive accuracy adjusted to remove the effect of chance. Analysis was performed separately for each attribute using the entire sample (\"training\" analysis), then one-sample jackknife analysis was conducted to estimate cross-generalizability of findings using the model to classify an independent random sample. Results: 378 total patients with a history of cancer tested positive for COVID-19 within the time frame of the study. Of these, 294 (78%) patients had ST malignancy and 84 (22%) patients had HM. Characteristics and outcomes are summarized in Table 1. ST patients were marginally older than HM patients (p<0.025). A significantly greater proportion of HM patients were male (p<0.0023). HM and ST patients did not differ with respect to percentage receiving active cancer treatment (p<0.81). Compared to ST patients, more HM patients had received corticosteroids in the 30 days prior to COVID-19 diagnosis (p<0.017), had higher rates of hospitalization (p<0.0013) and ICU requirement (p<0.0001) with a significantly longer length of ICU stay (p<0.0036). Compared to ST patients, HM patients also required oxygen (p<0.002) and mechanical ventilation (p<0.0005) more often and had a 3.88-fold statistically higher death rate (OR 3.88 [95% CI 1.62-9.29] p<0.003). Patients with HM are categorized by disease subtype and summarized in Table 2. The case fatality rate from COVID-19 was 33.3% for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms/myelodysplastic syndromes (MPN/MDS), 21.4% for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 13.6% for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 10.5% for patients with plasma cell neoplasms, and 4.5% for patients with acute leukemia. When looking at outcomes, CLL had the highest percentage of patients requiring hospital admission, oxygen, and ICU admission, and MPN/MDS had the highest percentage of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: Patients with hematologic malignancies had more severe COVID-19 illness and hospitalization rates and a 3.88-fold higher rate of death than patients with solid tumors. The comparable proportion of patients on anti-cancer therapy despite differences in survival suggests that being on anti-cancer therapy is less important than the underlying diagnosis of HM versus ST as a determinant of poor outcomes. Clinicians should closely monitor and initiate early COVID-19 treatments for all patients with HM and COVID-19. Because HM are highly heterogenous group of cancers, it is important to look at subtypes in greater detail. Numerous patient-level, disease-specific, and therapy-related factors may impact outcomes of COVID-19 among patients with HM, and we are currently analyzing additional data to better understand the factors which make this disease group more susceptible to severe infection.
