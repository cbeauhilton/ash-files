(Department of Statistics Jordan, 2008). About 12.7 % of the population is under 5 years old, and 37.3 % under 15 years old. 11%if the population are 15\u201319 year old, with a M:F ratio 1.06:1 as well) Only 3.3 % of the total population is above the age of 65 years old (sex ratio of 1.01 male per 1 female in this age group). According to the Jordan Cancer Registry Report for 2008, Lymphoma is the fourth most common Cancer in the country. A total of (4606 ) new cases of cancer were recorded among Jordanians in the year 2008, 333 (7.2%) of whom had a diagnosis of lymphoma.111 (2.4%) were diagnosed as Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), and 222 (4.8%) as Non Hodgkin Lymphoma(NHL). OBJECTIVE In this study, we aim to characterize some of the clinico-pathological features of Hodgkin lymphoma in Jordan by analyzing the data available for patients referred to King Hussein Cancer Center over a seven year period. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted of adults (>18 years) lymphoma patients referred to KHCC, between 1/1/2003 and 31/12/2010. Clinical features and histological subtypes were prospectively established for all patients registered in the Lymphoma Service Database. Pathology review and original paraffin block were mandated for all patients. RESULTS Over the 8 year period of 2003\u20132010,1329 lymphoma patients were referred to KHCC and registered in the Lymphoma Service Database, of whom 477 (35.9%) were diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Among this group all 477 patients were adults 18 years or older (100%), as children are treated in a different department. The median age was 35 years, (with an age range of 18\u201377), and 5% of patients were above the age of 60. 290 (61 %) of the patients were males, 187 (39%) were females, with a male to female (M:F) ratio of 1.55:1. 276 (57.8%) of the HL cases had a diagnosis of nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma (HDNS), making it the most common histological subtype. 120(25.2%) had mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma (HDMC), 9 (1.9%) had lymphocyte-rich Hodgkin lymphoma (HDLR), and 6 (1.2%) had lymphocyte-depleted Hodgkin (HDLD). Nodular lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHD) cases were 33, and constituted 6.9% of the HL cohort. CONCLUSION Hodgkin lymphoma appears to constitute a bigger share of the lymphoma burden in Jordan, as opposed to Europe and the US. Clinico-pathological features, however, appear to be closer to those described in Western countries, with similar incidence of HDNS, and HDMC subtypes, but possibly with less incidence of HDLR and HDLD subtypes.
