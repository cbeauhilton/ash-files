    "abstract_text": "We have previously demonstrated that stimulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2ARs) by epinephrine ex vivo induced human sickle (SS) but not normal (AA) erythrocytes (RBCs) adhesion to vascular endothelium and vaso-occlusion in nude mice. However, the molecular level at which RBC \u03b2AR signaling differentially regulates SS vs AA RBC adhesion has remained unexplored, and the adhesion molecule(s) activated by such pathways to mediate vaso-occlusion in vivo has not been defined. Since we have shown LW to mediate SS RBC adhesion to \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin in vitro , we first examined whether LW on SS RBCs mediated adhesion to endothelium in vivo and whether this interaction had pathophysiological significance. Window chambers were implanted into the dorsal skin folds of nude mice. To avoid endothelial activation, boluses of fluorescently labeled human SS RBCs were exposed to 20 nM epinephrine ex vivo , extensively washed, and then infused into mice after IV injection 30 min earlier of 500 \u03bcg of soluble RBC adhesion molecules LW (sLW) or CD44 (sCD44). In contrast to sCD44, IV sLW administration abrogated adhesion of subsequently injected epinephrine-treated SS RBCs to postcapillary vessels and significantly reduced vaso-occlusion in small diameter venules. Circulation of epinephrine-treated SS RBCs was noticeably improved by sLW, with fluxes of 4833\u00b11954 and 18618\u00b16092 circulating RBCs/min in animals receiving either sCD44 or sLW, respectively (p<0.001). These data strongly argue that activated SS RBC adhesion to endothelium is mediated in large part through LW, supporting the pathophysiological significance of \u03b2AR-induced LW activation in SCD. We then investigated at what molecular level this pathway responded differently in SS vs AA RBCs. Epinephrine at 20 nM and forskolin at 80 \u03bcM induced variable degrees of cAMP production in SS RBCs among patients, while cAMP production was minimal in epinephrine- or forskolin-stimulated AA RBCs. \u03b2AR density on SS and AA RBCs varied similarly between 15 and 70 fmol/mg protein and did not significantly correlate with increased cAMP production. The expression of adenylate cyclase also varied among donors in both SS and AA RBCs but was unrelated to cAMP response. Immunoblots of total RBC membrane proteins showed that the amount of membrane-associated PKA catalytic (PKA c ) and its subtype PKA\u03b2 c varied similarly among healthy donors and patients. However, the amount of membrane-bound PKA regulatory II\u03b2 (PKA RII\u03b2 ) was higher in AA RBCs when compared to the amount bound to the membranes of SS RBCs, suggesting that PKA\u03b2 c is already activated in SS RBCs. Forskolin induced a significant further reduction in membrane-bound PKA RII\u03b2 in SS RBCs with either high or low cAMP production, but not in AA RBCs, demonstrating that PKA RII\u03b2 dissociated from PKA\u03b2 c in SS RBCs even when adenylate cyclase was only modestly activated. These data suggest that there is a threshold above which cAMP production is capable of activating downstream kinases such as PKA in SS but not in AA RBCs. We then examined the A-kinase anchoring protein 79 (AKAP79), which can tether to the PKA type II regulatory subunit and is known to be involved in \u03b2 2 AR signaling. After forskolin stimulation, AKAP79 dissociated completely from membranes of SS but not AA RBCs. These data suggest that AKAP79 associates with PKARII\u03b2 in RBCs and that differential regulation of AKAP79 binding to PKA RII\u03b2 may lead to increased activation of PKA\u03b2 c and thus increased LW-mediated adhesion of SS but not AA RBCs in response to stimulation.",
