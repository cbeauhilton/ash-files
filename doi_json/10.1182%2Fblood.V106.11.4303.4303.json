    "abstract_text": "The issues of differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells still remain great increasing interests for the last recent years. For non-hemotological malignancies could these pluripotential stem cells be served as surrogates for the reconstruction of cell and organ function when solid carcinoma occurred or metastasized. New Zealand rabbits liver cancer model with squamous cells of VX2 implanted were used to explore the possibilities of mesenchymal stem cell into the hepatocytes. The results showed that there were abundant dispersed small roundness cells with mononuclear or binuclear were found in portal areas of normal liver lobes after mesenchymal stem cells had been implanted at 4 weeks, and those were originated from mesenchymal stem cells without expression of albumin, CK18 and CK19 by confocol laser microspopy; but the arrangement of partial hepatic cords was disordered near the portal areas of normal liver lobes, the cells was small like as renewal cells expressing albumin, Ck18 and CK19. It is hopefully firstly provided the evidence that mesenchymal stem cell could have the abilities and modulate the differentiation of hepatocytes which secreting albumin as well as CK18, CK19, but did not differentiate into cancer cells.",
