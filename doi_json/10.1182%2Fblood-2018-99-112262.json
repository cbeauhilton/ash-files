    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Blockade of complement factor C5 has demonstrated benefit in Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH), atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome and Generalized Myasthenia Gravis. We developed a human IgG4P antibody, REGN3918, that binds with high affinity to wild-type and variant (R885H/C) human C5. REGN3918 was well-tolerated in monkey toxicology studies with up to 26 weeks of dosing at up to 100 mg/kg/week. This finding was supportive of conducting this first-in-human study of REGN3918 in healthy volunteers. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this ongoing study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) doses and a multiple dose regimen consisting of an IV loading dose plus multiple weekly SC doses of REGN3918 administered in healthy volunteers. The secondary objectives of the study are to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of REGN3918. METHODS: 56 subjects were randomized to 4 sequential ascending IV dose cohorts plus 2 sequential ascending SC cohorts followed by 1 multiple dose cohort (consisting of an IV loading dose and weekly SC doses). Each cohort consisted of 8 subjects randomized to receive REGN3918 or placebo (6 active: 2 placebo). An adaptive design was implemented to allow for dose level and dosing interval adjustment utilizing in-study PK and PD measures. The PD profile of REGN3918 was assessed utilizing a sheep red blood cell complement activity assay (CH50 assay) as well as serum concentrations of total C5. REGN3918 was administered as follows: Cohort 1: 1 mg/kg IV, single dose Cohort 2a: 3 mg/kg IV, single dose Cohort 2b: 300 mg SC, single dose Cohort 3a: 10 mg/kg IV, single dose Cohort 3b: 600 mg SC, single dose Cohort 4: 30 mg/kg IV, single dose Cohort 5: Loading dose of 15 mg/kg IV followed by 4 repeat SC doses of 400 mg administered once weekly for four weeks. RESULTS: REGN3918 was found to be well tolerated in single doses of up to 30 mg/kg IV and 600 mg SC. The multiple dose Cohort 5 has completed dosing in all subjects and is currently in safety follow-up. Thus far, there has been one SAE, salpingitis in a subject with an intra-uterine contraceptive device. The SAE occurred in a Cohort 5 subject after completion of dosing and has since resolved. REGN3918 exhibited dose-dependent increases in exposure in serum, with a trend toward prolonged serum concentrations at IV doses \u226510 mg/kg. Following SC administration, concentrations of REGN3918 in serum peaked at 4 to 8 days post dose and bioavailability was estimated as approximately 70%. REGN3918 exposure led to dose-dependent inhibition of CH50. In all 4 IV dosing cohorts, suppression of hemolysis was observed at 15 min post-injection. Complete suppression of hemolysis was achieved with \u2265 3mg/kg dosing. At 30 mg/kg, complete suppression of hemolysis was maintained for >6 weeks, consistent with observed prolonged REGN3918 concentrations following this dose. In the 2 SC cohorts, peak suppression of hemolysis was observed 3-7 days post dosing, again consistent with observed peak concentrations of REGN3918 in serum. In the multiple dose cohort 5, complete suppression of CH50 was observed over the four-week dosing period. CONCLUSIONS: REGN3918 was well tolerated and resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of hemolytic activity in normal healthy volunteers. A single IV infusion of R3918, at 30 mg/kg, blocked hemolytic activity completely for >6 weeks. Complete inhibition of hemolytic activity was maintained over a 4-week dosing period by a weekly SC regimen following an IV loading dose.
