    "abstract_text": "Background: Bortezomib-dexamethasone-thalidomide has been reported to be effective in newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) with an overall response rate of 92% and a CR rate of 18% ( Alexanian et al, Hematology  12 (3): 235 \u2013239, 2007 ), but this regimen has not been reported in Chinese patients. We now report our experience with this combination. Objectives: To investigate the efficacy and safety of bortezomib in combination of dexamethasone plus subsequent thalidomide as primary treatment for MM. Patients and Method: Between June 2006 and August 2007, 11 consecutive newly-diagnosed patients with symptomatic MM were treated with bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, dexamethasone at 20 mg/m2 IV daily on the day of bortezomib and the day after. All patients received daily oral thalidomide that was escalated from 100 mg to 200 mg. Seven of 11 patients were male and 4 were female. Median age was 57 years (range 47\u201386). Seven of 11 patients were stage 2 according to the International Staging System, 4 out of 11 patients were stage 3. Eleven patients received a median of 2 cycles of therapy (range 1\u20136). The Blade criteria were used for response evaluation. Toxicities were evaluated according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 3. Results: Nine out of 11 patients (82%) achieved PR and 2 (18%) achieved CR; therefore the overall response rate was 100%. With a median follow-up duration of 5 months (1\u2013 14 months), no patients died. Grade 3\u20134 toxicities included fatigue (3/11), thrombocytopenia (3/11) , diarrhea (3/11) and orthostatic hypotension (2/11). Grade 2 neuropathy occurred in 3 out of 11 patients, herpes zoster occurred in 3 out of 11 patients. Routine anticoagulation or anti-thrombosis was not used. There was no DVT/PE in 11 patients. Conclusion: Our preliminary experience indicated that bortezomib-dexamethasone-thalidomide is highly effective in newly-diagnosed MM. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were rare after median 2 cycles of therapy. The relative lower rates of neuropathy and DVT/PE in this report with Chinese MM patients are being cautiously observed.",
