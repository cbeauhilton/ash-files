    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1896 Following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) influenza infections can be potentially life threatening. Prior studies demonstrate that following HSCT, the influenza vaccine is relatively ineffective at inducing influenza specific immunity\u2014especially early after transplant. Additionally, the effectiveness of the annual vaccine depends on recipient age, immune competence and antigenic potential of the three strains included. We hypothesized that a second vaccine dose, as is standard of care in vaccine nai\u0308ve pediatric patients, might improve vaccine specific immune responses in patients following allogeneic HSCT. During the 2010 influenza season, we conducted a clinical trial where patients who were >60 days post HSCT were stratified by age and steroid use, and randomized to receive either 1 (n=33) or 2 (n=32) influenza vaccinations separated by one month. Blood samples were obtained pre-vaccination, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after the first vaccine. Vaccine specific B and T cell responses were assessed using hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and IFN-g ELISPOT, respectively. Of the 65 patients, 73% (n=48) were >18 yrs old, 40% (n=26) received non-myeloablative conditioning and 35% (n=23) were umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplant recipients. HAI responses to the 2010/2011 vaccine components (H3N2, H1N1 and B/Victoria) were significantly greater for patients vaccinated >1 year post transplant (p5x increase in the number of spots over baseline). Recipients of 2 vaccines did not show a significant improvement in either HAI or in IFN-g ELISPOT responses. The HAI results were similar to the T cell specific responses in that patients >1 year after HSCT were more likely to develop positive responses compared to those vaccinated  UCB, p=0.005) and CD19+ unswitched memory cells (p=0.008). Our study illustrates that time from transplantation was the strongest predictor of vaccine associated responses, and that vaccine specific T cell responses can be elicited prior to antibody responses. Furthermore, UCB recipients had significantly fewer IFN-g vaccine specific responses. Surprisingly steroid use did not negatively impact vaccine responses. In summary an additional influenza vaccine dose, separated by 1 month, did not increase vaccine responses.
