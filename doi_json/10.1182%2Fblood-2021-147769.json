    "abstract_text": "Background: Guadecitabine (G) is a next generation subcutaneous (SC) hypomethylating agent (HMA) resistant to degradation by cytidine deaminase which results in prolonged in vivo exposure to the active metabolite decitabine. We conducted a large global randomized phase 3 study (ASTRAL-2) of G vs TC in AML patients who were either refractory to or relapsed (r/r) after prior anthracycline-based intensive chemotherapy with or without hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Methods: r/r AML patients were randomized to G (60 mg/m 2 SC/d for 10 days in first 1-2 cycles followed by 5-day cycles Q 28 days) vs Treatment Choice (TC). TC were preselected prior to randomization to either low intensity (LI) treatment; high intensity (HI) chemotherapy; or Best Supportive Care (BSC). LI choices were other HMAs of azacitidine or decitabine, or low-dose Ara-C (LDAC) at their standard doses. HI choices were high-dose Ara-C (HiDAC), MEC, or FLAG\u00b1 Ida combination chemotherapy at standard doses. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) based on ITT analysis with secondary endpoints including 12 and 24-month survival rates, complete response (CR), event-free survival (EFS), and safety. P values for secondary endpoints and subgroups are nominal as there was no adjustment of p values for multiple analyses. Results: 302 patients were randomized to G (148) or TC (154). Preselected TCs were mainly LI (77%) predominantly HMAs (86% of the patients randomized to LI), or HI (21%), with only 6 patients (2%) in the BSC subset. Baseline variables were well balanced across the 2 treatment arms. For G vs TC respectively, age \u226565 y in 51.4% vs 40.3% with median age 65y vs 63y, ECOG PS 2 in 15.5% vs 20.8%, poor risk cytogenetics in 44.6% vs 42.2%, refractory AML in 44.6% vs 33.1%, prior HCT in 18.2% vs 26%, a majority of patients were in second or subsequent relapse after \u2265 2 prior therapies (54.7% vs 56.5%). Median number of treatment cycles was short (3 cycles for G vs 2 cycles for TC). Median follow up was 21.6 months. Most common causes of treatment discontinuation were disease progression (35.2% for G vs 38.1% for TC), or death (15.2% for G vs 18.4% for TC). Median OS on G was 6.4 months vs 5.4 months for TC and not statistically significant (OS HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.67, 1.14, log rank p value  0.3 ). There was no significant difference in OS between G and each of the LI and HI preselected subsets. However, several other planned prospective subgroups favored G with OS HR 95% CI upper limit \u2264 1.0 including patients <65y (HR 95% CI 0.47, 0.97, p 0.032 ) ; ECOG PS 0-1 (HR 95% CI 0.57, 1.0, p 0.049 ); refractory AML (HR 95% CI 0.38, 0.89, p 0.013 ); lower peripheral blood (PB) disease burden of \u2264 30% PB blasts (HR 95% CI 0.46, 0.92, p 0.015 ); and those who received at least 4 cycles in either treatment arm (HR 95% CI 0.36, 0.95 , p 0.031 ). The 12- and 24-month survival rates for G vs TC respectively were 32% vs 26%; and 19% vs 10%. Median EFS was short with 3 months for G vs 2.4 months for TC; log rank p 0.005 . CR rate was 12.8% for G vs 7.1% for TC (p 0.051). CR + CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) rate was double for G with 16.9% compared to 7.8% for TC (p 0.007 ). Composite CR (CRc) or CR+ CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) rate was 27% for G vs 14.3% for TC (p 0.003 ). Adverse events (AEs) of grade \u22653, regardless of relationship to treatment, were 89% on G vs 84% on TC. Most common Grade \u22653 AEs for G vs TC respectively were febrile neutropenia (38.6% vs 38.1%); neutropenia (32.4% vs 17%); thrombocytopenia (28.3% vs 29.9%); anemia (21.4% vs 24.5%); pneumonia (18.6% vs 20.4%); and sepsis (11.7 vs 10.9%). None of the differences were significant except for neutropenia ( p 0.003 ). Summary/Conclusions: In this randomized study in r/r AML after intensive chemotherapy, G did not significantly improve OS compared to standard of care TC composed mainly of LI treatment with other HMAs. The data suggest that G may be better than TC in in some of the secondary endpoints (24-month survival rate, EFS, CR, CR+CRh, and CRc). Prospective subgroup analyses of OS suggest that younger (<65 y), more fit patients (PS 0-1); with lower PB disease burden (PB blasts \u2264 30%), and those who could receive at least 4 cycles may benefit from G. The results of secondary endpoints and subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution. Grade \u22653 AEs were the expected hematological and infection AEs with no significant differences between G and TC except for significantly higher incidence of neutropenia with G.
