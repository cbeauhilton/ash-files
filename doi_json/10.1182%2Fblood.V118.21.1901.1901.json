    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1901 Regulatory \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (\u03b3\u03b4 Tregs) is a novel subset of cells with immunosuppressive function while methods for \u03b3\u03b4 Treg induction is rarely introduced and its role in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prevention remains unkown. Decitabine, a kind of hypomethylating agents, can act synergistically with TGF-\u03b21 to convert a variety of \u03b1\u03b2 T cells to regulatory \u03b1\u03b2 T cells with suppressive function but its role in induction and function of \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs has not been reported. We show here the role of decitabine for the induction of \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs. Moreover, we provide functional analysis and underlying mechanisms of decitabine-induced \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs relative to \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs without decitabine induction as well as in vivo evidences of their preventions on GVHD. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cultured with IL-2, IL-15, TGF-\u03b21 and zoledronic acid (ZOL). On day 2, 0.5\u03bcmol/ml decitabine was added to aliquots of PBMCs. On days 4, 7, and 10, half of the supernatant volume was replaced with media containing cytokines. On day 11, frequencies of \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs were detected by flow cytometry (FACS). We found the frequency of \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs was 36.2% in TGF-\u03b21/IL-15/ZOL stimulated group (referred to as common \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs below) and 59.9% in IL-2/TGF-\u03b21/IL-15/ZOL/decitabine stimulated group (referred to as decitabine-induced \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs) (p<0.05). In order to compare immunosuppressive function of the two populations, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells containing \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs were isolated by magnetic cell sorting system (MACS) and tested for their ability to suppress proliferation of alloreactive PBMCs using CFSE-based assay. After 5 days of in vitro culture, CFSE-labeled PBMCs proliferation was significantly reduced in the presence of enriched \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs even at 8:1(PBMCs: \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs) ratio. The inhibition rate was significantly different (decitabine-induced \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs VS common \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs at ratio 1:1 is 81.3% VS 68.2%, p<0.05). To clarify the underlying mechanisms we performed ELISA to measure levels of inhibitory cytokines IL-10, IL-4 and TGF-\u03b21 in supernatant of CFSE-based assay. We noted an elevated IL-10 secretion in the decitabine-induced \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs group compared with common \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs group (92.7\u00b111pg/ml VS 10.3\u00b12pg/ml at ratio 1:1, p<0.01). We confirmed the result by intracellular IL-10 detection using FACS. Previous reports showed high levels of inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS) were correlated with IL-10 synthesis. So \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs were monitored for ICOS expression by FACS. The result revealed that ICOS expression was up-regulated in decitabine-induced \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs in contrast to common \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs (MFI: 268 VS 54). Stability of Foxp3 is a critical factor in the immunosuppressive ability of Tregs. Thus we evaluated the frequency of \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs after 5 days in CFSE-based assay. We observed loss of Foxp3 expression in decitabine-induced \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs was negligible (<3%) while 15.5% common \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs lost foxp3 expression. To confirm the results in vitro we tested the functional ability to prevent GVHD in vivo. GVHD was induced in NOD/SCID mice following busulfan and anti-CD122 condition and 1\u00d710 7 PBMCs transfusion. Animals were co-injected with either decitabine-induced \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs or common \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs at a ratio of 1:1. Survival time and GVHD manifestations of the transplanted mice were evaluated. As a result, transplantation of human PBMCs alone induced lethal GVHD with average survival time 25\u00b1 8 days while the survival time was 43\u00b1 5 days and 58\u00b17 days in mice co-injected with common \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs and decitabine-induced \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs, respectively (p<0.05). Clinical manifestations such as hunched back, diarrhea, and body weight loss were statistically different among 3 groups. To investigate the infiltration of human lymphocytes into nonlymphoid tissues in GVHD mice, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of the liver and intestines using anti-human CD45. Remarkably abundant invasion of human CD45+ cells was observed around the veins in the liver and intestines transplanted with PBMCs alone while less invasion in mice co-injected with common \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs and the lest invasion in mice co-injected with decitabine-induced \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs. Altogether, our findings reveal that decitabine and the cytokines can efficiently syngenerize to induce \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs with enhanced immunosuppression on GVHD which are via higher levels of IL-10 production due to ICOS up-regulation as well as stability of Foxp3 expression. Thus \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs may be potentially exploited therapeutically in a variety of transplantation settings. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
