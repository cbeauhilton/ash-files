    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3594 Poster Board III-531 Activation of Toll-like Receptors (TLR) 7 and 8 by engineered agonists has been shown to aid in combating viruses and tumors, and such compounds are in clinical use. We examined the effect of one agonist, R848, on monocyte Fc\u03b3 receptor (Fc\u03b3R) expression. Results showed that overnight treatment with R848 increased expression of Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIa and the common \u03b3-subunit. Surprisingly, expression of the inhibitory Fc\u03b3RIIb was almost completely abolished. We then treated bone marrow-derived macrophages from Wild-type, TLR7 \u2212/\u2212 , MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 , TRIF \u2212/\u2212 and Cryopyrin \u2212/\u2212 mice with R848 to test which pathway influenced Fc\u03b3R expression. Fc\u03b3R expression remained unchanged in TLR7 \u2212/\u2212 and MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 mice, suggesting that the TLR7 / MyD88 pathway was required. In order to test the functional effect of R848 treatment on monocyte Fc\u03b3R, we treated monocytes with R848 and then co-incubated them with Rituximab-coated Raji B-cell lymphoma cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the treated monocytes led to a significantly greater decrease in intact antibody-coated Raji cells. Further, R848 treatment synergistically increased monocyte Fc\u03b3R-mediated cytokine production. In conclusion, there are both regulatory and functional links between the TLR7/8 and Fc\u03b3R pathways. This has implications for both antitumor immunotherapy and autoimmune diseases.
