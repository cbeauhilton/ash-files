    "abstract_text": "In animal models hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and the hematopoietic cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) contribute to tissue regeneration after acute or chronic liver damage. In this study, we assessed whether: 1) G-CSF can be safely administered to patients with liver cirrhosis to expand and mobilize HSCs into peripheral blood; 2) G-CSF treatment affects residual liver function. Eighteen patients with a Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score < 10 and a Mayo Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score < 20 were considered eligible for the study. Increasing doses of G-CSF were administered subcutaneously for 7 consecutive days to 5 cohorts of 3 patients each, starting from 2.2 \u03bcg/kg/daily, until the achievement of the maximum-tolerated dose and/or the successful mobilization of \u226510 CD34 + cells/\u03bcl in at least 2/3 patients. G-CSF mobilizing dose was found at 15 \u03bcg/kg/day. Four additional patients were treated with the mobilizing G-CSF dose. All of them showed a successful mobilization of HSCs with a median peak value of CD34 + and CD133 + cells of 27.1(\u00b115.5) and 15.2 (\u00b15.1)/\u03bcl, respectively. Circulating HSCs were then collected by single volume leukapheresis and a median of 1.4(\u00b10.73)x10 6 CD34 + HSCs/kg body weight were cryopreserved. G-CSF treatment induced a significant increase of hepatocyte growth factor serum level. When we analyzed stem cell subsets, we found significant mobilization of early hematopoietic (CD34 + /CD38 \u2212 ) and endothelial (CD34 + /KDR + , CD133 + /KDR + ) progenitors as well as CD34 + /CXCR4 + cells. No severe adverse events were observed at any dosage or during leukapheresis. According to CTP and MELD score, no significant modification of liver function was observed during the treatment period and follow up (median=198 days) in both mobilizing and non-mobilizing patients. Nevertheless, in all treated patients a significant reduction of alpha-fetoprotein values was observed (p<0.001). In conclusion, the administration of G-CSF to patients with liver cirrhosis is safe, feasible and capable of mobilizing HSCs at the dosage of 15 \u03bcg/kg/day. Our study represents the first step for evaluating the role of G-CSF and mobilized HSCs to improve liver function in patients with liver cirrhosis."
