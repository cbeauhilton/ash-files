    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2078 Background: Health-related quality of life profile (HRQOL) of patients diagnosed with high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) can be compromised already at the time of diagnosis before receiving any kind of treatment. Clinical decision-making is challenging due to the poor prognosis and no data exist on the possible relationships between patient's HRQOL and the request of prognostic information on survival during consultation. Aim: The main objectives were to assess preferences for prognostic information of patients with high-risk MDS and the relationship between such preferences and patient characteristics including HRQOL. To date no such evidence exists in this population. Patients and Methods: Data were gathered through an ongoing international prospective observational study that recruits newly diagnosed patients with MDS. These patients typically have a limited life expectancy. At the time of diagnosis, and during one of the first clinical consultations in which treatment options were discussed, patients completed the European Organization for Research and treatment of Cancer, Quality of life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a psychometrically robust generic HRQOL cancer measure assessing both symptoms and functional aspects. Physicians also completed an extensive survey about their patient's preference for involvement in treatment decisions and whether the patient explicitly requested prognostic information for survival. Associations between request for prognostic information, HRQOL socio-demographic characteristics (i.e., living arrangements, age, gender, education) and clinical data including: performance status, comorbidity and disease severity (i.e. IPSS risk category intermediate 2 vs. high risk) were investigated using Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test as appropriate. Results: Overall, 184 patients (36% female and 64% male) were analyzed. Mean age of patients was 70 years (range: 31\u201388). 65% explicitly requested information about expected survival at the time of diagnosis. The symptom profile of patients requesting prognostic information was better than those who did not in 7 out of the 8 symptoms evaluated. The largest clinically meaningful difference was found for fatigue with a mean score of 39 (SD:26) and 52 (SD:28) respectively for those requesting prognostic information versus those who did not. Request for prognostic information was significantly associated with younger age (P=.01) and fewer comorbidities (P=.04). In addition, better physical functioning (P=.009), better role functioning (P=.002) and a lower level of fatigue (P=.002) were also associated with a request for prognostic information during consultation. Additional supportive analysis revealed that patients with a higher overall mean symptom score did not request information about survival (P=.02). Conclusion: These data suggest that the majority of patients with high-risk MDS request prognostic information on survival from their physicians at the time of diagnosis. There is also an indication that patients who are more likely to request such information are those who are in better health condition reporting higher functional abilities and lower symptoms.
