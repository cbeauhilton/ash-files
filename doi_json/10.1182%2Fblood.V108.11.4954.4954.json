    "abstract_text": "B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is a heterogenous disease with a highly variable clinical course and analysis of ZAP-70 and CD38 expression on B-CLL cells allowed for identification of patients with good (ZAP-70 \u2212 CD38 \u2212 ) and poor (ZAP-70 + CD38 + ) prognosis. DNA microarray technology was employed to compare eight ZAP-70 + CD38 + with eight ZAP-70 \u2212 CD38 \u2212 B-CLL cases. The expression of 358 genes differed significantly between the two subgroups including genes involved in B cell receptor signaling, angiogenesis and lymphomagenesis. Three of these genes, i.e. IRTA4/FcRH2, angiopoietin 2 and Pim2 were selected for further validating studies in a cohort of 94 B-CLL patients. IRTA4/FcRH2 expression as detected by flow cytometry was significantly lower in the poor prognosis subgroup as compared to ZAP-70 \u2212 CD38 \u2212 B-CLL cells. In healthy individuals IRTA4/FcRH2 protein expression was associated with a CD19 + CD27 + memory cell phenotype. Angiopoietin 2 plasma concentrations were two-fold higher in the poor prognosis subgroup (p<0.05). Pim2 was significantly overexpressed in poor prognosis cases and Binet stage C. Disease progression may be related to proangiogenic processes and strong Pim2 expression."
