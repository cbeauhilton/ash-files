    "abstract_text": "Between September 2000 and July 2004, 33 multiple myeloma (MM) patients (pts) \u2265 70 years of age were treated with thalidomide (THAL) alone (4 pts) or THAL plus corticosteroids (CS) (29 pts). Two were treated at diagnosis while 31 received THAL +/\u2212 CS after a median of 2 (range 1\u20135) prior regimens. Prophylactic anticoagulation was not routinely given. In most pts, the THAL dose was slowly increased as tolerated to a maximum of 200 mg/day. Initial CS therapy was pulse dexamethasone (DEX) in 14 and prednisone 50\u2013100 mg every 2 days in 15 pts; in 4, the DEX dose was reduced or changed to prednisone when responses were noted and/or CS toxicity was encountered. Median age was 73 (range 70\u201388) yrs; median beta2-microglobulin level was 403 (range 153\u20132120) nmol/L and CRP level 4 (range 1\u201391) mg/L at referral. MM subtype was IgG kappa:lambda (8:12 pts), IgA kappa:lambda (6:4 pts), light chain kappa:lambda (1:1 pts) and IgD kappa (1pt). Initial stage was IIIA:B in 20:5, IIA:B in 3:1 and IA in 4 pts. Cytogenetic studies were available in 11, of whom 1 had t(4;14), 2 complex changes, 1 monosomy 7 and 1 other abnormalities. Eighteen pts had significant cardiac disease, 3 vascular disease and 4 diabetes at the time therapy was initiated. Four had other hematological malignancies noted before/shortly after THAL +/\u2212 CS was started, including MDS in 2, essential thrombocytosis in 1 and AML in 1. The median maximum dose of THAL was 150 (range 50\u2013400) mg and the median duration of therapy was 7 (1.5\u201319+) mos. To date, 14 (42%) pts have achieved PR and 5 (15%) MR; four (12%) experienced stable disease. The median duration of response was 7 (range 1.5\u201323+) mos. Fatigue/sleepiness (5), syncope (2), peripheral neuropathy (4) and other reasons (4) necessitated THAL dose reductions in 15 pts; 7 pts stopped THAL due to toxicity. Two TIAs and 1 DVT were observed; 2 of these pts received appropriate medical therapy and continued THAL without further vascular complications. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Eleven of 33 (33%) remain on THAL +/\u2212CS. The actuarial overall survival rate was 80% at 1 year and 55% at 2 yrs after starting THAL +/\u2212 CS therapy, while the progression-free survival rate was 42% and 20% at 1 and 2 yrs, respectively. We conclude: 1) THAL +/\u2212CS can be given safely in elderly MM pts, although dose reductions are usually needed; 2) MM response/stabilization was achieved in 69%; 3) THAL +/\u2212 CS therapy offers a median benefit of 7 mos in poor prognosis elderly MM pts.",
