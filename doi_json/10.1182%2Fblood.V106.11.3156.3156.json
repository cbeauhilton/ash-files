    "abstract_text": "Notch signaling plays a critical role in T lineage commitment during lymphoid differentiation. However, Notch signaling alone is not sufficient to support T cell development through the CD4/CD8 double positive (DP) stage in vitro. We here report distinct effects of several cytokines on T cell differentiation in the OP9-DL1 cell culture model. Our studies show that Flt3 ligand enhances the proliferation of progenitors but has no obvious effect on differentiation. In contrast, stem cell factor (SCF) favors the proliferation of CD4/CD8 double negative (DN) lymphoid progenitors and inhibits differentiation to the DP stage in a dose-dependent manner. Differentiation of the NK lineage is promoted under these conditions. Conversely, blocking the function of SCF that is expressed endogenously by OP9-DL1 cells inhibits proliferation of lymphoid progenitors and accelerates T lineage differentiation. IL-7 is necessary for differentiation from the DP to the CD8 single positive (SP) stage, and is also required for \u03b3\u03b4 T lineage development. We also find a dosage effect of IL-7 during T cell development. OP9 and OP9-DL1 stromal cells produce endogenous levels of IL-7 that are sufficient to support B and DP T cell differentiation. However, the amount of endogenous IL-7 is not sufficient to support T cell differentiation from the DP to the SP stage. Addition of exogenous IL-7 (1\u201310 ng/ml) to the cultures promotes SP differentiation, while blocking endogenous IL-7 with anti-IL-7 antibody inhibits both B and T cell development. We conclude that activation through the Notch pathway is sufficient to suppress B lineage differentiation and thereby promote T lineage commitment, but is not sufficient to promote the subsequent stages of T cell development. SCF promotes expansion and directs NK lineage differentiation at the expense of T cell development, while IL-7 provides both proliferation as well as T lineage differentiation signals. T cell development from the DN to the DP stage requires a low amount of IL-7, while differentiation from the DP to the SP stage requires a higher level of IL-7. The balance between the effects mediated by these cytokines, along with Notch signaling, plays a critical role in regulating development of the T and NK lineages.",
