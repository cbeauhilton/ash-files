    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4832 T-cell immunodeficiency is a common feature in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and deficiency in CD3 levels was detected in T cells from these patients, which may represent a characteristic that is related to lower T cell activation. Based on our previous finding that the expression level of the TCR\u03b6 chain gene was decreased significantly in CML, we further investigated the expression pattern of the TCR\u03b6 regulating factors. TCR\u03b6 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR) and the alternative splicing factor/splicing factor 2 (ASF/SF-2), to evaluate the regulating effect of ASF/SF-2 on the formation of TCR\u03b6 3\u2032-UTR. Moreover, the expression levels and the correlations of the Fc\u03b5RI\u03b3 gene, which has a complementary to TCR\u03b6, and the TCR\u03b6 downstream ZAP-70 gene, were analyzed. The TCR\u03b6 3\u2032-UTR were amplified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 14 healthy individuals, 40 cases with CML and 22 cases with CML-CR by RT-PCR, and the splice variants of TCR\u03b6 3\u2032-UTR were identified. The expression levels of TCR\u03b6, Fc\u03b5RI\u03b3, ASF/SF-2 gene and ZAP-70 gene were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. The results showed that two types of spliceosome: wild typed TCR\u03b6 3\u2032-UTR (906 bp) and alternative spliced TCR\u03b6 3\u2032-UTR (344 bp) could be detected in all healthy individuals. However, 35% of CML cases contained only the wild typed TCR\u03b6 3\u2032-UTR, which was significantly different from healthy individuals and CML-CR groups ( p <0.001, p <0.001). The expression of TCR\u03b6 gene in CML group was significantly lower than healthy individuals and CML-CR groups ( p =0.001, p <0.001), while significantly higher expression of Fc\u03b5RI\u03b3 gene( p <0.001, p <0.001)and ASF/SF-2 ( p =0.016, p <0.001) were found in CML group. According to the TCR\u03b6 3\u2032-UTR spliceosome feature, the CML patients were divided in two subgroups, patients who contained only the wild typed TCR\u03b6 3\u2032-UTR named as WT + AS \u2212 CML group, and patients who contained two types of TCR\u03b6 3\u2032-UTR named as WT + AS + CML group. Significantly higher expression levels of ASF/SF-2 and Fc\u03b5RI\u03b3 genes were found in WT + AS \u2212 CML group in comparison with WT + AS + CML group ( p =0.003, p =0.001), while the expression levels of TCR\u03b6 and ZAP-70 were decreased in WT + AS \u2212 CML group ( Fig 1 ). In conclusions, the defective expression of TCR\u03b6 in CML might relate to the overexpression of ASF/SF2, which alternatively spliced the expression of TCR\u03b63\u2032-UTR. The upregulation of Fc\u03b5RI\u03b3 gene may overcome the defective status of TCR\u03b6 in a certain degree. Figure 1.
