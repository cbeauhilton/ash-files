    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3471 Fanconi anemia (FA) is associated with a high risk of secondary malignancies, more specifically solid tumors. In allogeneic stem cell transplantation of the \u201cnon-Fanconi anemia host\u201d, two factors have been consistently associated with increased risk of secondary malignancies post transplant and include graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and radiation. The goal of reducing the risk of GvHD post transplant, has been achieved successfully with T-cell depleted transplants, as previously reported. Our second aim was to reduce the risk of radiation toxicity post transplant. We therefore initiated a multi-center trial using the fludarabine (Flu)/cyclophosphamide (Cy)/ATG cytoreduction backbone, and substituting busulfan (Bu) instead of radiation. This was followed by a CD34+ T-cell depleted peripheral blood stem cell graft. From June 2009 to July 2012, 27 patients, including 13 males and 14 females aged 4.3 \u2013 31.4 (median 8.1), enrolled on this phase II multicenter protocol in 4 institutions. Indications for transplant included severe single lineage cytopenia (N=3), aplastic anemia (N=18) and myelodysplastic syndrome (N=6) - including refractory anemia RA (N=3), RA with excess blasts 1 RAEB1 (N=2), RAEB-2 (N=1). Prior treatment included transfusions (N=27) and androgens (N=12). Ten patients had a history of prior infections. Donors were Related mismatched (N=6) or Unrelated matched (N=16) or mismatched (N=5). Preparative regimen was: Bu 0.8\u20131.0 mg/Kg/dose Q 12H \u00d7 4 doses (days -7, -6), Cy 10 mg/Kg/day \u00d7 4, Flu 35 mg/m2/day \u00d7 4 days and Rabbit ATG 2.5 mg/Kg/day \u00d7 4 days (days -4 to -2). Patients also received filgrastim and GvHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine. Busulfan doses were adjusted to keep the steady state concentration below 350 in most cases. All grafts were T-cell depleted using the CliniMacs CD34 columns (Miltenyi). Cell doses of the grafts were: 3.1\u201342.7 \u00d7 106\u0302 CD34 cells/Kg and 2.2\u201349.9 \u00d7 103\u0302 CD3 cells/Kg. All 27 evaluable patients engrafted; one patient suffered a secondary graft failure. Two patients developed grade 1 and only one patient developed grade 2 GvHD. Grade 2\u20134 toxicity included mucositis (N=10), pulmonary toxicity (N=6), hepatotoxicity (N=6) with one patient developing hepatic veno-occlusive disease, renal toxicity (N=5), and hypertension (N=7). Infections included: CMV viremia (N=4), EBV viremias (N=1), clostridium difficile (N=1), bacteremia (N=5) and clostridium botulinum (N=1). Cause of death for four patients was acute respiratory failure (N=1), multi-organ failure (N=1), severe pulmonary hypertension (N=1) and infection (N=1). With a median follow-up of 7.9 months (range 0.5\u201337.8 months) 19 of 23 evaluable patients are alive and well (4 pts too early for outcome analysis). Although the study is ongoing an includes a relatively small number of patients with modest follow-up, the results appear promising. Engraftment, GVHD, early toxicity, infection and outcome data appear similar to historical TBI-based protocols. Further enrollment and longer follow up will define the comparative toxicity profile and relative risk of second tumor. Disclosures: Williams: bluebird bio: Consultancy; Wyeth: ; Takara bio: ."
