    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-13 Notch signaling is a central regulator of differentiation in a variety of organisms and tissue types. Its activity is controlled by the multi-subunit \u03b3-secretase complex (\u03b3SE) complex. Although Notch signaling can play both oncogenic and tumor suppressor roles in solid tumors, in the hematopoietic system, it is exclusively oncogenic, notably in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a disease characterized by Notch1 activating mutations. We identified somatic inactivating Notch pathway mutations in a fraction of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patients. Inactivation of Notch signaling in mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) results in an aberrant accumulation of granulocyte/monocyte progenitors (GMP), extramedullary hematopoieisis and the induction of CMML-like disease. Transcriptome analysis reveals that Notch signaling regulates an extensive myelomonocytic-specific gene signature, through the direct suppression of gene transcription by the Notch target Hes1 . These studies identify a novel role for Notch signaling during early hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and suggest that the Notch pathway can play both tumor-promoting and suppressive roles within the same tissue. These observations also suggest that Notch activity is not simply a promoter of the T cell lineage in the thymus but that Notch signaling thresholds could regulate commitment and/or survival of distinct hematopoietic lineages in the bone marrow. To address these issues in vivo , we have generated Notch receptor lineage tracing and activity reporter genetic tools. Analysis of these animal models identified unique novel functions for the Notch pathway during early bone marrow hematopoiesis. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
