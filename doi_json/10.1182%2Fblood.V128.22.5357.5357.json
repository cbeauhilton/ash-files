Context: Brentuximab Vedotin (BV) is a chimeric anti CD30 IgG1 antibody, conjugated to synthetic antitubulin momomethyl auristatin. BV is approved for the treatment of classical HL in relapse either after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or after two lines of combination chemotherapy in transplant ineligible patients. The AETHERA trial revealed increased PFS when BV is used as maintenance therapy after ASCT. Objective: Compare the effectiveness of BV as maintenance or salvage therapy after ASCT for relapsed/refractory (R/R) HL. Design: A retrospective analysis conducted on patients with R/R HL treated with BV after ASCT either as maintenance or salvage therapy. Analysis after a median follow up of 12 months is reported. Setting: The study was conducted in a single institution; American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC) after IRB approval. Patients: The study included 15 adult patients with R/R HL treated with BV with the following indications: \u00e1 Maintenance therapy after ASCT in high risk patients \u00e1 Salvage therapy for relapse after ASCT or allo-SCT Intervention: BV at 1.8mg/kg IV every 4 weeks for the above indications. Main outcome measures: response rate (RR), overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). Results: Nine high-risk patients (60%) received 4 cycles of BV as maintenance therapy post ASCT. Six additional patients (40%) in relapse after ASCT (n=5) or after allo-SCT (n=1) received BV as salvage therapy for an average of 4 cycles (range 3-21). Patients characteristics are listed on Table 1. RR was 33% in 6 patients who received BV as salvage post SCT. Two patients proceeded with allo-SCT in the salvage group. After a median follow up of 9 months, only 2 patients (22%) in the maintenance group progressed and all patients are still alive. Conversely, in the salvage group, 4 patients (67%) progressed and 1 patient developed secondary AML and died. Conclusion: BV therapy showed an efficacy only as maintenance treatment after auto-SCT but was less successful when used as post-transplant salvage in R/R HL. Four cycles of maintenance may suffice. Prospective trials with larger samples are warranted to support these findings. View large Download slide View large Download slide  Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
