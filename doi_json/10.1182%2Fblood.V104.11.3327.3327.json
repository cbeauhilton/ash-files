    "abstract_text": "With the advent of reduced intensity conditioning regimens, new treatment options are available to patients who suffer relapse of Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (HL) following autoSCT, but the efficacy of this procedure is not proven. We retrospectively compared the cohort of adult patients who received alloSCT for relapse of HL following autoSCT to those who did not at a single institution. 64 patients underwent autoSCT for HL between 7/87 and 5/02: 41 for relapsed disease, 16 for primary refractory disease and 7 unclassified. Thirty-five patients (55%) relapsed at a median 12.5 months (range 0.9 to 140) after autoSCT. Eleven patients underwent alloSCT a median of 182 (35 \u2013 645) days after relapse; 7/11 received reduced intensity conditioning, 5/11 received SCT from an unrelated donor. Of 24 patients who had relapsed after autoSCT (and did not receive an alloSCT), 16 survived at least 6 months and were considered in this analysis. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) > grade 2 occurred in only one patient, 5 /9 evaluable patients developed chronic GVHD (2 extensive). Five recipients of alloSCT have died: 2 with relapsed disease, 2 with disseminated fungal infections and 1 with interstitial pneumonitis. 6 patients remain alive, 5 remain free of disease. Median event free survival is12.5 months for recipients of alloSCT with median follow up of 3.1 years. Median overall survival is 4.1 years (64 days \u2013 12.5+ years) and estimated overall survival is 71% at 3 years. This compares favorably with a median overall survival of 1.4 years in patients who survived at least 6 months, but did not receive alloSCT after relapse. Improved survival in the alloSCT cohort demonstrates that potent graft-versus-lymphoma activity can be achieved against HL without significant GVHD.",
