    "abstract_text": "Although multiple myeloma is clinically defined as the accumulation of clonal, malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow, the disease shows significant heterogeneity with regard to morphology, progression and therapeutic response. Our hypothesis is that this heterogeneity likely is due, in part, to germline genetic polymorphisms that contribute significantly to an individual\u2019s disease course and response. In particular, individuals deficient in the repair of DNA damage are not only at high risk for developing cancer, but also could show DNA repair dependent responses associated with DNA damaging therapeutic agents. In this study we examined the association of functional genetic polymorphisms in the DNA repair genes, XRCC1 (SNP positions 280, 399) and ERCC2 (SNP positions 312, 751), with toxicities and clinical outcomes in the ECOG, 3 arm chemotherapeutic trial, E9486 [A-VBMCP, B-VBMCP+Cylophosphamide, C- VBMCP+interferon]. DNA from 359 patients was genotyped and examined for association with response, toxicities, blood counts, bone pathology, and survival parameters. Notably, in the interferon arm of the trial significant associations were observed in progression free survival and polymorphisms of XRCC399 (AA median survival 51 months versus AG/GG median survival of 33 months; p=,008), ERCC751 (AA/AC median survival 33 months versus CC median survival of 48 months; p=.05), and ERCC312 (AA median survival 49 months versus AG/GG median survival of 34 months; p=.02). Hazard ratios ranged form 1.7 to 2.05 for survival differences associated with DNA repair genes in this arm. Interestingly, T cell counts are known to be impacted by interferon; and DNA repair polymorphisms in this arm were also associated with CD8+ T cell counts. While this represents a single arm of one clinical trial, it is intriguing to consider the impact of genetic polymorphisms on DNA repair in light of chemotherapeutic agents that may affect cells of the immune system. Previous studies from the ECOG Myeloma Committee of the E9486 trial show highly significant associations of survival and immune status in myeloma patients. Our results suggest genetic polymorphisms in DNA repair genes may influence clinical outcome in certain therapeutic regimens. Genetic polymorphisms in these DNA repair genes are currently being completed in 800 patients of the SW9321 SWOG/ECOG intergroup trial and additional association studies will be included in the presentation.",
