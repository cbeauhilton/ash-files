    "abstract_text": "Infiltration of activated monocytes into the brain of HIV-infected patients is a prerequisite for the development of HIV-associated dementia (HAD). The chemokine stromal derived factor-1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1) is expressed at increased levels in the central nervous system (CNS) of HAD patients and elicits chemotaxis and other cellular effects through its receptor CXCR4. In this project, we investigated the intracellular signaling pathway by which SDF-1\u03b1 mediates the movement and attachment of monocytes to brain microvascular endothelia, and which may contribute to their infiltration into the CNS in HAD. We demonstrated that SDF-1\u03b1 stimulates migration of primary human monocytes through its receptor CXCR4, and decreases monocyte adherence to surfaces coated with ICAM-1. SDF-1\u03b1 also decreases monocyte adherence to brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVEC) activated with the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2, or with recombinant HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (gp120), which increase endothelial cells expression of ICAM-1. The decreased monocyte adherence was linked to down regulation of the activation-dependent epitope of the \u03b22 integrin LFA-1 which is a ligand for ICAM-1. We then demonstrated that the Src family kinase Lyn is a central modulator of migration and LFA-1-mediated adhesion of SDF-1\u03b1-stimulated primary monocytes. Using siRNA knockdown we achieved 80% down regulation of Lyn kinase in human monocytes. Lyn down regulation decreased SDF-1\u03b1-mediated migration and prevented its inhibition of monocyte attachment to ICAM-1 coated surfaces and activated BMVEC. These data indicate that in SDF-1\u03b1-stimulated primary human monocytes Lyn is a positive regulator of cell migration, and a negative regulator of cell adhesion to BMVEC by inhibiting the ICAM-1 binding activity of the LFA-1 integrin. Thus, CXCR4-triggered inside-out integrin signaling, through Lyn, inhibits adherence and stimulates movement of monocytes towards SDF-1\u03b1 gradient on BMVEC monolayers. These results provide new insight into the intracellular signaling cascade that controls primary human monocytes movement and attachment at the blood brain barrier.",
