    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2763 Approximately 50% of CP CML patients achieve complete molecular response (CMR) at 6\u20137 years of first-line imatinib therapy. Although imatinib therapy is effective in CML patients and a substantial portion of patients achieve CMR with prolonged imatinib therapy, up to 10^7 leukemic cells can still be present in the absence of detectable BCR-ABL in RQ-PCR assay due to the sensitivity limit of current RQ-PCR technology. The recent data from STIM (Stop Imatinib) trial showed that the probability of persistent CMR at 12 month follow-up after imatinib discontinuation was 41%, and the conclusion was that imatinib can be safely discontinued, at least in some patients with persistent CMR. However, it is still not clearly defined whether discontinuation of imatinib therapy can be safely employed in patients with sustained CMR. In our prospective study, we examined if imatinib therapy can be safely discontinued in CML patients with sustained CMR 4.5 according to strict PCR sensitivity criteria, and CMR 4.5 was defined as undetectable BCR-ABL using RQ-PCR assay with at least 4.5-log sensitivity. CML patients who were treated with imatinib for more than 3 years and whose BCR-ABL was undetectable in RQ-PCR for at least 2 years were enrolled in this study. Our primary objectives were to evaluate the probability of persistent CMR 4.5 at 12 month follow-up after discontinuation, and to measure the duration of persistent CMR 4.5 after discontinuation. The secondary objective was to evaluate the probability of major molecular response (MMR) loss and the time taken to lose MMR at 12 month follow-up after discontinuation. In patients with loss of MMR, the probability of re-achieving MMR/CMR 4.5 and the time taken to re-achieve MMR/CMR 4.5 after imatinib resumption were also evaluated. After discontinuation, molecular response was monitored using RQ-PCR assay every month up to 6 month follow-up, every 2 months up to 12 month follow-up, and every 3 months thereafter. Digital PCR methodology with higher sensitivity compared to RQ-PCR assay was also applied before discontinuation and every year after discontinuation for more accurate estimation of BCR-ABL transcript levels. In case of relapse, defined as loss of MMR on 2 consecutive assessments, imatinib therapy was re-introduced and molecular response after resumption was observed using both RQ-PCR and digital PCR assays. As of data cut-off date of 15 Jul 2011, 20 patients (13 females, 7 males) who were diagnosed in Seoul St. Mary's Hospital between 20 Mar 1996 and 25 Apr 2005 were enrolled in this study with a median follow-up of 7 months (range, 2\u20139), and informed consents were obtained from all patients prior to participation. With a median age of 44 years (range, 25\u201367), the percentages of patients with low, intermediate and high Sokal risk scores were 30%, 30% and 15%, respectively with unknown Sokal risk scores in 25%. Ten patients (50%) received SCT and/or interferon therapy prior to imatinib therapy, while 10 patients (50%) received first-line imatinib therapy. The median time on imatinib therapy and the median duration of sustained CMR 4.5 were 91 months (range, 40\u2013112) and 60 months (range, 23\u2013104), respectively, prior to discontinuation. Since discontinuation of imatinib therapy, all of 20 patients remained off therapy at the last follow-up with persistent CMR 4.5 in 18 patients (90%) and loss of CMR in 2 patients (10%). Although loss of CMR was observed in 2 patients, both patients have not resumed imatinib therapy as MMR was maintained at the last follow-up. Our preliminary data show lower relapse rate after discontinuation compared to previous discontinuation studies. Strict PCR sensitivity criteria should be employed to assess the accurate measurement of BCR-ABL transcript levels prior to discontinuation, and then it might be possible to safely stop imatinib therapy in CML patients with stable CMR 4.5 . Through further clinical investigation on a large patient population and longer period of observation, more concrete conclusion can be made regarding the outcome of imatinib discontinuation. Updated data with longer follow-up duration will be presented in the meeting. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
