    "abstract_text": "Introduction: A randomized phase III trial demonstrated improved overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) for older patients diagnosed with therapy-related AML (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) treated with a liposomal formulation of daunorubicin-cytarabine (CPX-351) when compared with 7+3 induction and consolidation therapy, a previous standard of care. Based on those results, CPX-351 was approved in 2017 in the United States (US) for adults with newly diagnosed t-AML and AML-MRC irrespective of age. However, the health economic implications of CPX-351 from a US payer perspective are not well-characterized. Methods: We constructed a partitioned survival analysis based on the data from the original phase III trial (Lancet et al. JCO 2018) and subsequent updates (Lancet et al. Lancet Haematology 2021) and post-hoc analyses from the landmark trial (Villa et al. JME 2019). Newly diagnosed AML patients at a median age of 68 years entered the model with active AML and received either CPX-351 or 7+3 induction and consolidation therapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) for some patients. Parametric survival distributions were fitted using patient-level data recreated from the Kaplan-Meier curves and at-risk tables for EFS and OS for both study arms. Log-logistic distributions demonstrated the best fit and were chosen for this model. Frequency and setting (inpatient vs outpatient) of re-induction and consolidation therapy were used as outlined in the original study. Costs and practice patterns of salvage therapy, receipt of allo-HCT, supportive care, and incidence of complications were derived from the original trial or published literature ( Table ). If available, costs for the Medicare population rather than commercially insured patients were used. For the CPX-351 arm, the maximum new technology add-on payment granted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for fiscal year 2020 was added to the costs of inpatient induction and consolidation therapy in the 7+3 arm. Costs were adjusted for inflation to 2020 US dollars using the personal consumption expenditure health index. Previously published utilities were used and measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs and utilities were discounted by 3% annually (range 3-5% in one-way sensitivity analysis) and modelled over a 10-year time horizon. Model outputs were used to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for CPX-351 over 7+3. A willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000/QALY gained was used to determine cost-effectiveness. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed with utility values varied with a 10% range and all other variables across a 50% range. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, beta distributions were used to describe probabilities and utilities, while gamma distributions were used for costs. Results: CPX-351 and 7+3 were associated with lifetime costs of $371,482 and $256,415, respectively, for an incremental cost of $115,066 with CPX-351. CPX-351 resulted in an incremental gain of 0.49 QALYs compared to 7+3 (CPX-351: 1.11 QALYs vs 7+3: 0.62 QALYs) resulting in an ICER of $231,563/QALY gained in the base case analysis. In one-way sensitivity analyses our model was most sensitive to the probability of receiving allo-HCT in either arm ( Figure ). In threshold analyses, a reduction of the CPX-351 add-on charge in the inpatient setting by 70.4% (from $47,353 to $14,004) would lower the ICER below the WTP threshold of $150,000/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis yielded a median ICER of $222,894 (95% credible interval: $142,863 - $313,289) with 7+3 favored in 96.4% of 10,000 iterations at a WTP threshold of $150,000. Conclusion: Use of CPX-351 under the current pricing model is unlikely to be cost-effective for most older patients with t-AML/AML-MRC who resemble those enrolled in the clinical trial. A reduction by 70.4% for the CPX-351 add-on charge in the inpatient setting would be necessary to lower the ICER below the conventional WTP threshold of $150,000/QALY. Higher rates of allo-HCT and outpatient consolidation with CPX-351 did not lead to gains in clinical utility or cost reductions substantial enough to make CPX-351 cost-effective. The implications of a potential outpatient administration of CPX-351 induction on its cost-effectiveness require additional studies.
