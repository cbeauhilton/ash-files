    "abstract_text": "Therapy for patients with high-risk Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) involves the use of cytoreductive agents such as recombinant human interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1), hydroxyurea (HU), and anagrelide (AG). Despite the significant activity of IFN-\u03b1 in MPDs, therapy with this agent is frequently hindered by poor tolerance and inconvenient dosing schedules. PEG-IFN-\u03b1 is formulated by covalently attaching polymers of ethylene glycol to the native IFN-\u03b1 molecule, which results in decreased renal excretion and increased serum half-life that allows for weekly administration with acceptable toxicity. Based on the superior pharmacokinetic profile of PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2a relative to conventional IFN-\u03b1, we designed a phase II study of subcutaneous PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2a (Pegasys) for patients with ET or PV. A total of 50 patients have been enrolled and treated thus far (22 ET, 28 PV). Median age is 53 years (range, 23\u201377) and time from diagnosis to PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2a 64 months (range, 1\u2013348). Prior therapies (median 2; range 0\u20136) included HU (n=33), AN (n=22), phlebotomy (n=27), IFN-\u03b1 (n=8: 5 oral and 3 sc), other (n=10). PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2a was the initial therapy in 4 patients. The JAK2 V617F mutation was detected in 11 (50%) of 22 ET and in 26 (93%) of 28 PV patients. Six (12%) patients had abnormal cytogenetics. Initial starting dose of PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2a was 450 mcg/week, but that was modified to the current starting dose of 90 mcg/week. Dose modifications are allowed according to response or toxicity. Patients are currently receiving 450 mcg (n=1), 360 mcg (n=1), 270 mcg (n=5), 180 mcg (n=11), 135 mcg (n=8), 90 mcg (n=9), and 45 mcg (n=5). After a median follow-up of 11 months (range, 2\u201328), 47 (94%) patients have responded. Complete response (CR) was achieved by 46 (92%) patients (for ET: platelets <440x10 9 /L, off HU and AG, in the absence of thromboembolic events; for PV: Hb 10% reduction in JAK2 V617F expression, including 2 (7%) in whom the mutant allele became undetectable. In addition, 4 (13%) patients had a 5%\u201310% reduction. JAK2 V617F quantitation has not been repeated yet in 9 patients. PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2a was well tolerated in most patients. Twenty-two episodes of grade 3\u20134 toxicity were reported, including neutropenia (n=11), elevated transaminases (n=4), and anemia, thrombocytopenia, depression, fatigue, infection, cardiac, and pain in 1 case each. Ten patients were taken off study, including 6 (12%) due to therapy-related toxicities: grade 3 neutropenia (n=1), fatigue (n=1), depression (n=1), ischemic retinopathy (n=1), dyspnea (n=1),and diarrhea (n=1). In summary, therapy with PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2a results in remarkable clinical activity and acceptable toxicity profile in patients with ET or PV. Significant reduction of JAK2 V617F allele burden occurred in a proportion of responders, suggesting selective targeting of the malignant clone.",
