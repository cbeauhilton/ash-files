    "abstract_text": "The mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) containing mTOR and rictor is thought to be rapamycin-insensitive, and was recently shown to regulate the pro-survival kinase AKT by phosphorylation on Ser473 ( Sarbassov Science 2005;307 and Mol Cell 2006;22 ). We investigated the molecular effects of mTOR inhibition by rapamycin analog CCI-779 in AML cells. Unexpectedly, CCI-779 not only inhibited the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) containing mTOR and raptor with decreased phosphorylation of p70S6K, 4EPB1 and reduction in Glut-1 mRNA, but also blocked AKT activation via inhibition of mTORC2 formation. This resulted in suppression of phosphorylation of the direct AKT substrate FKHR and decreased transcription of D-Cyclins in AML cell line and 5 of 8 primary AML samples in vitro. Similar observations were made in samples from patients with hematological malignancies who were treated with the rapamycin analogs temsirolimus or everolimus: the levels of Ser473 phosphorylated AKT decreased in 3/5 patient samples at 1 or 24 hour(s) of temsirolimus treatment, and in 6/8 patient samples treated with everolimus. In the 9 samples in which AKT was inhibited, \u22652-fold decrease in Cyclin D1 mRNA was observed in 5, Cyclin D2 in 3, both, Cyclin D1 and D2 in 1 sample, and Glut-1 in 4 patient samples. In 7 of the 9 patients in whom AKT was inhibited, a >50% decrease in peripheral blood absolute blast count (3 AML, 1 ALL) or absolute lymphocyte count (1 CLL) for >1 week duration was documented, and two patients with RAEB-1 had improvements in platelet counts, one fulfilling the criteria for clinical response (hematological improvement). No change in peripheral blood counts or progression of leukemia was seen in 6 patients. Of these, decrease in pAKT was observed in 2, no change in 3 and increase in 1 (Fisher exact two-tailed p= 0.021). Altogether, our study provides first evidence that rapamycin analogs inhibit AKT signaling in primary AML cells both in vitro and in vivo , and support the therapeutic potential of mTOR inhibition strategies in leukemias."
