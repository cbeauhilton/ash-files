    "abstract_text": "Ineffective erythropoiesis (IE) in \u03b2-thalassemia has been attributed to erythroid cell death mediated by apoptosis or hemolysis during the maturation process. Historically, ferrokinetic studies in this disease suggested that 60%\u201380% of erythroid precursors die in the marrow or extramedullary sites. However, several observations have challenged this view. First, the number of apoptotic erythroid cells in patients is low compared to net expansion of the erythroid cell pool. Second, hemolytic markers in \u03b2-thalassemic patients are normal or only slightly increased, unless additional pathological conditions appear. Third, our most recent study (Blood, Gardenghi et al, 2007 Jun 1) demonstrated that GI iron absorption in \u03b2-thalassemia is increased by the dysregulation of genes such as hepcidin and ferroportin that control iron absorption, resulting in iron levels that exceed the amount required for erythropoiesis. We have undertaken a detailed investigation using cohorts of mice (n>30 per genotype) with \u03b2-thalassemia intermedia ( th3 /+) and major ( th3/th3 ). Using these models, we have previously shown that the severity of anemia (as low as 1 g/dL) inversely correlates with the total number of nucleated erythroid cells (\u00bb100 fold compared to wild-type (wt) mice). Cytological analysis has clearly shown that thalassemic spleen specimens were comprised of a homogeneous pre-erythroblastic population. In contrast, the percentage of apoptotic cells and the level of hemolytic markers, such as bilirubin and lactic acid dehydrogenase, slightly increased or were not different compared to wt mice. While not excluding a role for apoptosis, our observations suggest that control of the cell cycle and maturation of erythroid precursors play an important role in IE. We then explored whether the erythroid cell cycle was dysregulated in our model system. We found that erythropoietin (Epo) levels were raised in thalassemic animals by as much as three orders of magnitude. Binding of Epo to its receptor (EpoR), activates antiapoptotic and cell cycle promoting genes, through activation of Jak2 and Stat5. By Western blot we demonstrated up-regulation of EpoR, Stat5 and the antiapoptotic protein BclXL, as well as that of proliferation promoting genes, such as CycA and Cdk2, in purified thalassemic erythroid cells compared to those of wt animals. This data was confirmed by staining both wt and thalassemic liver and spleen sections using the proliferation markers Ki67 and Mcm3, by clonogenic assay and by analysis of the percentage of erythroid cells in S-phase after BrdU injection. In the latter case, we observed 22%, 30% and 44% BrdU + cells from wt, th3 /+ and th3/th3 mice, respectively. In addition, freshly purified thalassemic erythroid cells proliferate faster in vitro than normal cells, a phenomenon blocked by AG490, a Jak2 inhibitor. Significantly, we have been able to reproduce results from our animal studies in humans, comparing normal and thalassemic blood and spleen specimens. In conclusion, we propose that IE in \u03b2-thalassemia is likely to be the result of altered cell proliferation and impaired cell differentiation, which in turn limit apoptosis, thereby mimicking tumor-like behavior.",
