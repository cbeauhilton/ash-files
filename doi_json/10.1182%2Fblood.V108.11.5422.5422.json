    "abstract_text": "Background: Several trials have shown that autologous stem cell transplantation is superior to conventional therapy in terms of complete response (CR) rate, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). This treatment, however, is generally limited to patients younger than 65 due to concerns about excessive toxicity and treatment-related mortality (TRM) in older patients. Previous reports have shown that age alone should not exclude patients from high-dose therapy, as long as they fulfill other eligibility criteria. In this report we analyzed the safety and efficacy of high-dose chemotherapy (HDT) and autologous transplant in patients with MM who were \u2265 70 years at the time of autotransplant. Methods: Twenty-six patients (16 males, 10 females) with a median age of 72 (range 70\u201379) underwent HDT and an autograft between July 1999 and October 2005. The preparative regimen was melphalan 200 mg/m2 in 19 patients (73%), melphalan 180 mg/m2 in 6 and melphalan140 mg/m2 in 1 patient. Of the 26 patients, 12 were receiving first remission consolidation, 7 had primary refractory disease and 7 had relapsed disease. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities were present in 5 patients (19%). Results: Twenty-two of the 26 patients were alive after a median follow up of 15 months (range 2\u201363). Responses (complete + partial response) were seen in 20 patients (77%), five (19%) of which were complete responses. Median EFS and OS were 19 and 31.6 months, respectively. 100-day TRM was 0%. Median times to absolute neutrophil count of \u22650.5 \u00d7 10 9 /l and platelets \u226520 \u00d7 10 9 /l were 10 and 10 days, respectively. Three-year EFS and OS were 37% and 49%, respectively. A low serum albumin (<3.5 g/dl) was associated with a shorter EFS (p=0.02), and patients with relapsed disease at transplant had a shorter OS (p=0.002). ISS stage, b2 microglobulin level, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level, abnormal cytogenetics, CCI or HCT-CI at the time of transplant did not emerge as significant predictors of PFS or OS in this group of patients. Conclusions: HDT and autologous transplant is safe and feasible in selected patients \u226570 years of age. The outcome is comparable to younger patients undergoing an autograft, and older patients receiving conventional therapy."
