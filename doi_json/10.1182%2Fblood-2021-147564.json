    "abstract_text": "Dosing with duvelisib 25 mg BID has been shown to be efficacious in iNHL, most notably the pivotal phase 2 DYNAMO study (NCT01882803) in follicular lymphoma (FL). The TEMPO study (NCT04038359) was designed to examine the effects of prespecified 2-week dose holidays on tumor responses and safety/tolerability in patients with iNHL (FL, MZL), based on data from a phase 3 trial (DUO) in CLL/SLL which demonstrated no negative impacts of (unscheduled) dose interruptions on response. In TEMPO, patients were randomized to receive duvelisib 25 mg BID for one 10-week cycle followed by 25 mg BID on Weeks 3 and 4 of each subsequent 4-week cycles (Arm 1) or duvelisib 25 mg BID on Weeks 1, 2, 5, 6, 9 and 10 of one 10-week cycle, then on Weeks 3 and 4 of each subsequent 4-week cycles ( Arm 2) . Patients continued treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. As of May 5, 2021 data cutoff, a total of 65 treated pts had at least 4 months of follow up on or after study drug treatment. Across both arms, the median age was 63 years (range 34-85), and 47 (72.3%) of the patients remained on study treatment at the time of this analysis (table 1). 18 of 65 pts (27.7%) discontinued therapy; 13 of 65 pts (19.7%) discontinued due to PD: 7 out of 33 (21.2%) in arm 1 and 6 out of 32 (18.8%) in arm 2. Of the remaining 5 pts (out of 65 patients) that discontinued, all were in arm 1: 4 out of 33 pts (12.1%) due to adverse events and 1 out of 33 (3%) due to study drug interruption > 42 days. Across both arms, the ORR was 60% (39 of 65 pts), and the CR rate was 12.3% (8 of 65 pts). See table 2 for responses by arm. Grade > 3 AEs were higher in Arm 1 vs Arm 2, with the exception of neutropenia: elevated ALT/AST was 30.3%/27.3% vs 3.1%/3.1%; neutropenia 9.1% vs 18.8%; GI disorders 9.1% vs 0; infections 9.1% vs 3.1%; rash 6.1% vs 3.1%; and drug reaction with eosinophilia 3% vs 0 -- respectively. Discontinuation of study drug due to AEs only occurred in arm 1, in 5 out of 33 patients (15.2%), and were due to ALT/AST elevations (2 of 33 pts, 6.1%); skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (2 of 33 pts, 6.1%); and pneumonia (1 of 33 pts, 3.0%). In summary, based on this interim analysis, continuous dosing followed by intermittent dosing (arm 1) and intermittent dosing (arm 2) are both efficacious in patients with iNHL. The ORR and CR are similar to those seen in DYNAMO. The study confirms the overall safety profile of duvelisib, demonstrating that intermittent dosing may well decrease the incidence of side effects without compromising efficacy.
