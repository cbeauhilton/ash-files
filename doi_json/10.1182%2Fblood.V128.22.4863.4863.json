    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Previous studies have shown that general prevalence rate of Hepatitis B is 0.3%, Hepatitis C is 1.3% and HIV is 0.39% in United States and that these infections are more common in low income groups and African Americans. We did retrospective analysis of 458 adult patients with SCD to estimate the prevalence of these infections in our large population. Methods: We retrospectively collected data of 458 adult patients with SCD to calculate prevalence of Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B and HIV. We also collected data of type of SCD and ethnicity. Results: Out of total 458 adult patient with SCD, 25/458(5.4%) had Hepatitis C, 10/458(2.1%) had Hepatitis B and 4/458(0.87%) had HIV. In SC type of SCD, prevalence of Hepatitis B was 1/114(0.87%), Hepatitis C was 4/114(3.5%) and HIV was 1/114(0.87%). In SS type of SCD, prevalence of Hepatitis B was 7/263(2.66%), Hepatitis C was 19/263(7.22%) and HIV 3/263(1.14%). In Sickle beta thal group, prevalence of Hepatitis B was 1/75(1.33%), Hepatitis C was 2/75(2.66%). No cases of HIV were fund in this group. Conclusion: The prevalence of HIV, hepatitis C and hepatitis B is higher in adult patient with SCD compared to general US population. At our institute we screen all patients with SCD for these infections, especially Hepatitis C and refer infected patients for the appropriate treatment.
