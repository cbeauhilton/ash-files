    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Stability of a FVIII preparation in mini-pumps is an important consideration for its use in a continuous infusion manner. Our goal was to evaluate the stability of a specific recombinant FVIII (Kogenate \u00ae FS; KOGENATE\u00aeBayer) in two commonly used infusion mini-pumps, with and without anticoagulant additives that may be used in clinical practice to prevent local thrombophlebitis. Methods: Kogenate \u00ae FS (250 IU/vial and 1000 IU/vial) was reconstituted using aseptic technique according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions with normal water for injection (100 IU/ml and 400 IU/ml, respectively); an additional dilution of 100 IU/ml was made from the 1000 IU/vial size. Reconstituted material was spiked with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH; Enoxaparin/Clexane) to a final concentration ~5 U/ml, or left untreated and then transferred to reservoirs of 2 mini-pumps (Walkmed, Medfusion Inc., Duluth, GA and CADD, Deltec, Inc., St. Paul, MN). All bags were stored in a light-protected environment at room temperature (22\u00b0C) for 7 days. Samples were drawn at baseline (immediately post reconstitution), 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h, and days 2\u20137, frozen at \u221230\u00b0C, and assayed for FVIII activity by one-stage assay. On Day 7, the residual volume of the mini-pump containers was cultured for bacteria. Results: All samples except one* had FVIII activity >90% of baseline. Conclusions: Kogenate \u00ae FS appears to retain excellent stability at room temperature during 7 days in both CADD and Walkmed infusion pumps with and without addition of UFH or LMWFH. No bacterial growth was observed. These results indicate that Kogenate \u00ae FS may be useful in continuous infusion therapy.
