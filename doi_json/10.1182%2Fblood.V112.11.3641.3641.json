    "article_date": "November 16, 2008",
    "session_type": "Myelodysplastic Syndromes",
    "abstract_text": "The del(5q) is the most commonly reported deletion in de novo MDS and is found in 10\u201315% of all patients. Our group demonstrated haploinsufficiency for the ribosomal gene RPS14, which is required for the maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits and maps to the commonly deleted region in patients with the 5q- syndrome ( Boultwood et al, Br J Haematol  2007 , 139 : 578 \u201389 ). Haploinsufficiency of RPS14 has been shown to be the mechanism underlying the erythroid defect in this disorder ( Ebert et al, Nature  2008 , 451 : 335 \u20139 ). We have recently shown that haploinsufficiency of RPS14 in patients with the 5q- syndrome is associated with deregulated expression of ribosomal- and translation-related genes, suggesting that the 5q- syndrome represents a disorder of aberrant ribosome biogenesis ( Pellagatti et al, Br J Haematol  2008 , 142 : 57 \u201364 ). The del(5q) in the 5q-syndrome is cytogenetically indistinguishable from the del(5q) found in other MDS and in the vast majority of these patients the CDR of the 5q- syndrome will be deleted (and therefore one allele of RPS14 will be lost). We are investigating the hypothesis that haploinsufficiency of RPS14 and consequent deregulated ribosome biogenesis may also play a role in the pathogenesis of non-5q- syndrome MDS patients with del(5q). Using Affymetrix U133 Plus2.0 arrays, we have studied the expression profiles of a group of 579 ribosomal- and translation-related genes in the CD34+ cells of 21 non-5q- syndrome MDS patients with del(5q) and 95 MDS patients without del(5q). 168 of 579 ribosomal-and translation-related probe sets were found to be significantly differentially expressed between these two groups, with approximately 90% of these showing lower expression levels in patients with del(5q). Hierarchical clustering using this set of 168 genes gave a good separation between patients with and without the del(5q). RPS14 was one of the most significant differentially expressed genes, with lower expression levels in patients with del(5q) confirming its haploinsufficient status in these patients. Other significant differentially expressed genes include the ribosomal protein RPL22L1 , and the translation initiation factors EIF4EBP3 and EIF4B . Interestingly, when samples from 16 patients with 5q- syndrome were included in the analysis, hierarchical clustering using significantly differentially expressed ribosomal- and translation-related genes showed that most patients with 5q- syndrome and most patients with del(5q) clustered together. We are currently using polysome profile analysis on bone marrow cells to examine the levels of the 40S ribosomal subunit in patients with del(5q) and without del(5q). Our results support the hypothesis that haploinsufficiency of RPS14 and deregulation of ribosomal- and translation-related genes contribute to disease pathogenesis in MDS patients with del(5q). An exciting possibility is that other MDS with the del(5q) and the 5q- syndrome share a related molecular basis in that they are all disorders of defective ribosomal biogenesis.",
