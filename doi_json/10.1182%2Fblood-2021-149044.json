    "abstract_text": "Background Early hematopoietic reconstitution is essential for improving survival and reducing complications after hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSC/HPC) transplantation (HSCT/HPCT). Increasing HSC/HPC homing to the bone marrow is a potential approach for promoting hematopoietic reconstitution. Methods We proposed the transplantation of HSCs/HPCs with a magnetism-induced cell-targeting transplantation (MagIC-TT) strategy. HSCs/HPCs were magnetized with CD45 microbeads. The biological characteristics (morphology, proliferation, viability, and ferroptosis) and target migration ability of these cells were studied in vitro. The hematopoietic reconstitution experiments were constructed in vivo in autologous and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation models with grouping showed as Table 1. The therapeutic effects were assessed by survival, donor chimerism, routine blood examination and histological analysis. We also performed transcriptomic sequencing for further mechanistic studies. Results The biological characteristics was found no significant difference between the MagIC-TT and non-MagIC-TT groups, while migration ability was greatly improved with MagIC-TT (Data not showed). The survival rate was higher in the MagIC-TT group and significantly different in the allogeneic model ( P <0.05). Hematopoietic reconstitution of donor chimerism, WBCs, HGB, and PLTs was faster in the MagIC-TT groups (within 22 days) (Figure 1). Confocal observation showed that more donor cells (eGFP + ) were retained in the injected femur of the MagIC-TT group than in the femur of the non-MagIC-TT group 7 days after transplantation ( P <0.05) (Figure 2). The severity of aGVHD (Assessed by survival, body weight, back arching, fur losting, diarrhea etc. ) was reduced in the MagIC-TT groups in the allogeneic model ( P <0.05) (Data not showed). Transcriptome sequencing revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in localization/locomotion and pathways, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions and chemokine signaling pathways between the two groups (Figure 3). Conclusion The MagIC-TT strategy improves HSC/HPC homing, resulting in faster hematopoietic reconstitution in a murine bone marrow transplantation model.
