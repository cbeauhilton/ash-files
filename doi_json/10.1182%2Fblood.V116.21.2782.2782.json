    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2782 Tipping the balance between effector and regulatory cell populations is of critical importance in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune disorders. Both, mast cells (MC) and regulatory T cells (Treg) have gained attention as immunosuppressive cell populations. To investigate a possible interaction, we used the Th1- and Th17-dependent model of nephrotoxic serum nephritis (NTS), in which both MC and Treg have been shown to play a protective role. We recently provided evidence that adoptive transfer of wild-type (wt) Treg into wt recipients almost completely prevents development of NTS. We here show that Treg transfer induces a profound increase of MC in the kidney draining lymph nodes (LN). In contrast, transfer of wt Treg into animals deficient in MC, which are characterized by an exaggerated susceptibility to NTS, do not prevent acute renal inflammation. Blocking the pleiotropic cytokine IL-9, which is known to be critically involved in MC recruitment and proliferation, by means of an antagonizing monoclonal antibody in animals receiving wt Treg abrogated protection from NTS. Moreover, we provide clear evidence that Treg-derived IL-9 is critical for MC recruitment as mediators of their full immune-suppressive potential, as adoptive transfer of IL-9 deficient Treg failed to protect from NTS. In line with our hypothesis, absence of Treg-derived IL-9 does not induce MC accumulation into kidney-draining LN, despite the fact that IL-9 deficiency does not alter the general suppressive activity of Treg, as shown by in vitro testing of their functional capacities. Finally, we observed a significantly decreased expression of the MC chemoattractant Cxcl-1 in the LN of mice receiving IL-9 deficient Treg as compared to mice receiving wt Treg or control CD4 + CD25 \u2212 T cells, which might at least in part explain the deficient MC recruitment under these conditions. In summary, our data provide the first evidence that the immunosuppressive effects of adoptively transferred Treg depend on IL-9-mediated recruitment of MC to the kidney draining LN in NTS. This data is in perfect agreement with our previous report showing that CCR7-mediated LN occupancy of Treg is a prerequisite for their immune-suppressive potential and furthers adds a piece of information to the functional understanding of the in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of Treg.
