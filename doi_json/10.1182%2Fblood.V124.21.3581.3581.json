    "abstract_text": "Borjeson\u2212Forssman\u2212Lehmann syndrome (BFLS), a hereditary X-linked disorder characterized by mental retardation, truncal obesity, gynecomastia, hypogonadism and other dysmorphic features, is known to be caused by germline (GL) mutations of plant homeo domain finger protein 6 ( PHF6 ). PHF6 is a highly conserved 41kDa protein showing ubiquitous expression in a variety of tissues, including bone marrow, CD34 + cells and blood leukocytes. Human PHF6 is located on chrXq26.2. Recently, rare somatic nonsense mutations and deletions have been detected in patients with T-ALL and AML and found in some T-ALL cell lines. Patients with BFLS with PHF6 mutations have been reported to develop leukemia, suggesting PHF6 mutations may predispose cancer. Although the actual function and molecular pathogenesis is unknown, PHF6 has been suggested to be a tumor suppressor gene involved in the control of myeloid development. In an index case of a young adult female patient with proliferative CMML with dysmorphic features, we have identified remarkable GL mosaicism for PHF6 mutation (p.K44fs), confirmed by deep sequencing of marrow, CD3 + cells and skin tissue. Subsequently, we screened patients with myeloid neoplasms by targeted multi-amplicon sequencing to determine the prevalence and distribution of PHF6 gene alterations. Sequencing results from 1072 cases were analyzed (728 by targeted deep sequencing and 344 by whole exome sequencing). In total, we identified 21 cases with PHF6 mutations, 13 of which were frameshift or nonsense mutations. Previously, PHF6 have been included in screening panels by Haferlach et al., (Leukemia 2014) and Papaemmanuil et al., (Blood 2013) and somatic mutations were found in 24/944 and 21/738 cases of MDS, respectively. These results along with ours suggest that PHF6 mutations are common driver events. The somatic nature of these defects was confirmed by analysis of non-clonal CD3 + lymphocytes, thus, PHF6 mutations occur at a frequency of 2.0% and are most frequently observed among patients with secondary AML (33%, P =.0021). Gender distribution showed a strong male predominance (76%), likely due to the location of PHF6 on chrX and indicating that retention of a single copy of PHF6 may be protective. SNP-array karyotyping showed that deletions of Xq, involving the PHF6 locus (Xq26), were present in about 1.2% of myeloid neoplasms and affect only female patients. As a family, plant homeo domain (PHD) finger genes are affected by mutations associated with various cancers. JARID1A, PHF23, NSD1 and NSD3 were described to serve as fusion partners with the NUP98 in a subset of AML cases. The most frequent chromosomal aberration observed in conjunction with PHF6 mutations was trisomy-8 ( P =.08). The most commonly associated somatic mutations were in RUNX1 ( N =7; P =.001), U2AF1 ( N =5), ASXL1 ( N =5), IDH1 ( N =4), and DNMT3A ( N =4). Interestingly, 6/7 cases with concomitant PHF6 and RUNX1 mutations showed a poor prognosis AML. Subsequent analysis of clonal architecture using variant allelic frequency calculations and serial samples for these cases suggested that PHF6 may function as a founder driver gene while RUNX1 mutations are acquired as secondary events. Recent studies proposed that PHF6 deficiency leads to impaired cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest at G 2 /M phase and an increase of DNA damage. To examine DNA damage and quantify double stranded breaks (DSBs) in primary cells from PHF6 -mutants, those with wild-type (WT) PHF6 and normal bone marrow we used a flow cytometric anti-\u03b3H2AX assay, following induction of DNA damage with Camptothecin. As judged by greater percentages of anti-\u03b3H2AX labeled cells, DSBs were more common in mutant cases consistent with more DNA damage present in PHF6 mutant compared to WT MDS and normal bone marrow cells. In conclusion, our results indicate that PHF6 mutations are generally present in more aggressive types of myeloid neoplasms, frequently associated with RUNX1 mutations. Our functional in vitro studies along with recently published reports suggest an association of PHF6 deficiency with genomic instability and thereby provide a basis for a mutator phenotype conveyed by ancestral lesions, consistent with its role as a tumor suppressor gene.
