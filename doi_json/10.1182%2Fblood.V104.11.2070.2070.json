    "abstract_text": "Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ), a gram-negative bacterium, is suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Recent studies from Italy and Japan showed that more than a half of H. pylori -positive patients with ITP achieved a partial or complete platelet recovery after eradication of H. pylori . To examine therapeutic action of H. pylori eradication therapy, we performed a prospective study in which ITP patients were treated with a standard eradication regimen (a combination of lansoprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin for one week) irrespective of the presence or absence of H. pylori infection. Thirty-seven adult patients (mean 56.4 years of age) with chronic ITP and a platelet count below 50 x 10 9 /L were enrolled. Platelet counts and circulating anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody-producing B cell frequencies were monitored at 0, 1, 12, and 24 weeks after initiation of the eradication therapy. H. pylori infection was found in 26 (70%) patients by means of a urea breath test, while the remaining 11 patients were negative for all of a urea breath test, a stool antigen test, and a serum antibody test. Although H. pylori -positive patients tended to be older than H. pylori -negative patients (P = 0.06), other characteristics, such as disease duration, previous treatment regimens, platelet count and anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody-producing B cells, were not different between these 2 groups. Twenty-five (96%) H. pylori -positive patients were successfully eradicated. At 24 weeks, a significant response (platelet count > 100 x 10 9 /L) was observed in 16 (64%) of 25 eradicated patients, but not in a H. pylori -positive patient who failed in the eradication. In addition, a platelet count did not change at all in 11 H. pylori -negative patients, indicating that platelet recovery results from eradication of H. pylori itself, but not from immunomodulatory effects of the drugs used or eradication of microorganisms other than H. pylori . Anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody-producing B cells were significantly reduced at 12 and 24 weeks in H. pylori -positive responders (P < 0.0001) as well as, to a lesser extent, in H. pylori -positive non-responders (P = 0.02), but not in H. pylori -negative patients (P = 1.0). In the majority of responders, a platelet count was already increased at one week when anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody-producing B cells were not decreased. To further evaluate therapeutic action of H. pylori eradication, changes of anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody-producing B cell frequency at one week after initiation of varuous therapies were additionally examined in ITP patients who responded to intravenous immunoglobulin (n = 6), corticosteroids (n = 7), or splenectomy (n = 7). The B cell frequency was significantly decreased after treatment with corticosteroids and splenectomy (both for P < 0.0001), whereas a stable B cell frequency observed at one week after H. pylori eradication was compatible with intravenous immunoglobulin that primarily inhibits Fc receptor-mediated platelet phagocytosis. In summary, this prospective study confirms effectiveness of H. pylori eradication for chronic ITP and a direct role of H. pylori infection in the pathogenesis of ITP. The platelet recovery after H. pylori eradication is likely to be mediated through complex processes; inhibition of Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis followed by suppression of anti-platelet autoantibody production.",
