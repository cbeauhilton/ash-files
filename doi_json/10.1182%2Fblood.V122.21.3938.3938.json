    "abstract_text": "Background Activating mutations [primarily internal tandem duplication (ITD) events] in FLT3 are detected in 30% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The clinically active FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) AC220 (quizartinib) has achieved complete remissions in relapsed/refractory FLT3-ITD+ AML patients in a phase II study (Cortes, et al and Levis et al, ASH 2012, abstracts 48 and 673) but is vulnerable to resistance-conferring mutations in the FLT3 kinase domain (KD). The F691L \u201cgatekeeper\u201d substitution was the most commonly detected mutation in an in vitro mutagenesis screen for AC220 resistance (Smith et al, Nature 2012). This mutation, and substitutions at the activation loop residue D835, have been associated with acquired clinical resistance to AC220 (Smith et al, Nature 2012; Alber et al, Leukemia 2013). Mutations at gatekeeper residues such as F691 have repeatedly surfaced as mediators of clinical resistance to TKIs. Identifying TKIs that retain activity against these substitutions has consistently proven challenging. PLX3397 is a potent and selective inhibitor of FMS, KIT and FLT3-ITD with a half-life of 20 hours in humans, resulting in \u00b5M steady-state plasma concentrations at the recommended phase II dose for AML patients. PLX3397 retains activity against the AC220-resistant FLT3-ITD/F691L mutant, but not against several D835 mutants (Smith et al., ASH 2011, abstract 764). In this study, we conducted a mutagenesis screen of FLT3-ITD and FLT3-ITD/F691L to identify single and compound mutations that confer resistance to PLX3397 and may cause acquired resistance in patients. Results PLX3397 inhibited the proliferation of BaF3/ FLT3-ITD cells at a concentration well below that achieved in patients (IC50 0.14 \u00b5M) and retained activity against cells expressing the FLT3-ITD/F691L mutant (IC50 0.350 \u00b5M). Other AC220-resistant mutants (D835V/Y/F and Y842C/H) conferred substantial cross-resistance to PLX3397 (\u223c50 to 400-fold shift in IC50 of FLT3-ITD; ranging from 7.2 to >10 \u00b5M). An in vitro mutagenesis screen of FLT3-ITD identified several mutations conferring resistance to PLX3397, including novel substitutions in 3 residues which conferred \u226510X resistance relative to FLT3-ITD: D835E/G/N, D839A/G and R845G (IC50s 1.4 to 4.1 \u00b5M). Given the in vitro activity of PLX3397 against the AC220-resistant F691L mutant, it is anticipated that PLX3397 will be administered to patients who acquire resistance to AC220 or sorafenib due to this mutation; a mutagenesis screen of FLT3-ITD/F691L was therefore conducted. We identified multiple KD mutations in FLT3-ITD/F691L conferring \u226510X resistance to PLX3397 (compared to FLT3-ITD) including several mutations in the FLT3 activation loop: D835H/G/E/N, D839A/G/N, N841K, Y842S, R845G (IC50s 1.6 to >10 \u00b5M), and 2 mutations in residues located in the tyrosine kinase domain 1 (TK1) domain: N676S, a residue previously implicated in clinical resistance to the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 (IC50 2.8 \u00b5M), and M664I, a residue not previously linked to FLT3 inhibitor resistance (IC50 2.0 \u00b5M). While all identified mutants conferred some degree of resistance to PLX3397 in the absence of an F691L mutation, most conferred a higher degree of resistance in the setting of F691L, suggesting a cooperation between the gatekeeper residue and residues in the activation loop and TK1 domain that impacts PLX3397 binding. Finally, we conducted a preliminary analysis of samples from AML patients who relapsed after an initial response to PLX3397. Using Pacific Biosciences Single Molecule Real-Time Sequencing, we identified evolution of polyclonal FLT3 KD mutations at the D835 residue at the time of relapse in 2 patients, including, in one patient, novel PLX3397-resistant D835E/H mutations identified in our mutagenesis screen. Analysis of additional patient samples for single and compound resistant mutations is ongoing and will be presented. Conclusions PLX3397 harbors promise for the treatment of FLT3-ITD+ AML, particularly for patients who have developed resistance to FLT3 TKIs due to the gatekeeper F691L mutation. However, a mutagenesis screen reveals PLX3397 is vulnerable to mutations in the FLT3 activation loop and TK1 domain. Patients acquire secondary FLT3 KD mutations at the time of resistance to PLX3397, confirming the mechanism of action of this clinically active FLT3 inhibitor. A multi-site phase I/II study of PLX3397 in FLT3-ITD+ AML is ongoing. Disclosures: Smith: Plexxikon Inc: Research Funding. Off Label Use: Unapproved drugs for AML: AC220 and PLX3397.
