    "abstract_text": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the most common morbid complication related to cancer and its treatments. Although malignancies are characterized by a hypercoagulable state leading to VTE, the pathophysiology of this state has not been well studied. Growth arrest specific 6 (Gas6) is a protein that has pro-coagulant properties. Gas6 deficient mice develop smaller venous thrombi as compared to wild type mice, and express less tissue factor in the endothelium when challenged with thrombotic stimuli. We hypothesize that Gas6 may be involved in cancer-induced venous thrombosis. In order to test this hypothesis, venous thrombi were induced in wild type (WT) and Gas6 null (-/-) mice injected with M27 murine lung cancer cell lines. Thrombus size was measured using ultrasonography, thrombus weight and histology. We observed that WT mice with cancer developed larger thrombi than their healthy counterparts (p<0.05). However, these larger thrombi induced by cancer were not seen in Gas6 -/- mice, suggesting that Gas6 has a pathophysiologic role in promoting malignancy associated VTE. Whole genome microarray analysis was then used to identify differential gene expression in WT and Gas6 -/- endothelial cells co-cultured with M27 murine lung carcinoma cells. Microarray analysis revealed that prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES) was increased in WT endothelial cells but not in Gas6 -/- cells co-cultured with M27. These results were confirmed using real-time PCR and immunofluorescence staining (p<0.05). In WT endothelial cells, PTGES expression was regulated through ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We also show that co-culture of WT endothelial cells with M27 augments the secretion of PGE2, the enzymatic product of PTGES. PGE2 activates platelets in vitro after binding to its receptor, EP3. In vivo, EP3 receptor antagonism reversed the effect of cancer-induced thrombosis in WT mice. These results show that Gas6, through upregulation of PGE2, contributes to cancer-induced VTE.
