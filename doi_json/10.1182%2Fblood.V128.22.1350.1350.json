    "abstract_text": "Binding of soluble fibrinogen to the activated open conformation of the integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is required for platelet aggregation and is mediated exclusively by the C-terminal AGDV-containing dodecapeptide (\u03b3C-12) sequence of the fibrinogen \u03b3 chain. Paradoxically, however, peptides containing the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequences located in two places in the fibrinogen A\u03b1 chain inhibit soluble fibrinogen binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Moreover, the A\u03b1 chain RGD motifs make substantial contributions to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 binding when fibrinogen is immobilized and when it is converted to fibrin. The interaction of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 with a variety of RGD- and \u03b3C-12 peptides has been studied extensively, but the characteristics of their binding to the active open and inactive closed conformations of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 are largely unknown. Here, we have used both experimental and computational approaches to compare the two-dimensional kinetics, thermodynamics and structural details of cyclic RGDFK (cRGDFK) and \u03b3C-12 binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23. First, we employed optical trap-based single-molecule nanomechanical measurements to determine the probability of peptide binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 as a function of the time the peptides interact with \u03b1IIb\u03b23. In the optical trap-based experimental system, a microscopic bead coated with either cRGDFK or \u03b3C-12 is trapped in a fluid chamber by a focused laser beam and moved in an oscillatory manner to touch a stationary pedestal coated with \u03b1IIb\u03b23. When the peptide on the bead interacts with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 on the pedestal, tension is generated when the bead is displaced from the laser focus until the \u03b1IIb\u03b23-peptide bond ruptures. The percentage of binding/unbinding events at a particular time of contact duration enabled us to plot the force-free binding probability as a function of contact duration. From these curves, we extracted first-order binding rates: 0.61\u00d710 -14 cm 2 /s for \u03b3C-12 and 0.71\u00d710 -14 cm 2 /s for cRGDFK and unbinding rates: 2.05/s and 1.53/s for the \u03b3C-12 and cRGDFK, respectively. Corresponding binding affinity constants were 0.3\u00d710 -14 cm 2 and 0.46\u00d710 -14 cm 2 for the \u03b3C-12 and cRGDFK, respectively, indicating that cRGDFK binds to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 somewhat tighter than \u03b3C-12. These measurements were then followed by computational modeling using NMR-determined 3D solution structures of cRGDFK and \u03b3C-12, as well as the crystallographically resolved \u03b1IIb\u03b23 conformers of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 headpiece (PDB entries: 3ZDX and 3ZE2). Docking analysis confirmed that both cRGDFK and \u03b3C-12 bound to the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 conformers at a site located in the interface between the \u03b1 subunit \u03b2-propeller domain and the \u03b2 subunit \u03b2I domain. Estimated docking energies revealed that the closed \u03b1IIb\u03b23 conformation is almost as reactive towards the peptides as the open conformation. Next, we probed the strength of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23-peptide interactions and determined their comparative binding energies and the dynamics of interatomic contacts by performing dynamic force-ramp unbinding in silico using all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations in implicit solvent on Graphics Processing Units. Force was increased linearly at a pulling rate of 2\u00d710 4 \u03bcm/s and applied to specified C \u03b1 -atom of the peptides. Analysis of the molecular force profiles and the number of ligand-receptor binding contacts revealed that both peptides interact strongly with \u03b1IIb\u03b23, forming stable bimolecular complexes that dissociate in the 60-120 pN range through several competing unbinding pathways that display multi-step kinetics and distinct bond lifetimes. We profiled the Gibbs free energy (\u0394G) of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23-peptide complexes as a function of the separation distance between the open form of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 headpiece and the peptide using the Umbrella Sampling technique. The results showed that the energies of ligand binding to the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 headpiece are \u0394G~16 kcal/mol for cRGDFK and \u0394G~13 kcal/mol for \u03b3C-12, meaning that the overall thermodynamic stability of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23-peptide complex is higher for cRGDFK than for \u03b3C-12. Thus, these results provide a kinetic and thermodynamic explanation for previous observations that the affinity of RGD for \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is greater than AGDV and support our hypothesis that the RGD motifs preferentially support the interaction of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 with immobilized fibrinogen and fibrin.
