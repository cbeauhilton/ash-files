    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Congenital bone marrow failure syndromes (CBMFSs) are a heterogeneous class of diseases with overlapping phenotypes. Therefore, a precise and comprehensive genetic diagnostic system is strongly warranted to arrive at appropriate clinical decisions to avoid ineffective therapies and/or lethal complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, a large panel of newly identified causative genes of CBMFSs have been identified in recent years; therefore, it is virtually impossible to establish a routine genetic diagnostic test using conventional Sanger sequencing. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) is a promising solution for the diagnosis of inherited diseases because it tests virtually all genes simultaneously. For the introduction of WES into clinical practice, it is necessary to clarify whether this technique has superior diagnostic efficacy to conventional clinical genetic tests. Methods: We performed WES in 250 patients with CBMFSs lacking genetic diagnoses. Exome capture was performed using the SureSelect\u00ae Human All Exon V3\u20135 kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), which covers all known coding exons, followed by massively parallel sequencing using the HiSeq 2000 Sequencing System (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Our established pipeline for WES (genomon: http://genomon.hgc.jp/exome/) detected >20,000 candidate variants per patient. Diagnoses were based on variants of 130 genes with pathogenicities confirmed by published studies. Results: Genetic diagnoses were possible in 68 patients (27%). The best efficacy was achieved in patients with Fanconi anemia [35/73, 48%; FANCG (n = 17), FANCA (n = 14), FANCB (n = 1), FANCF (n = 1), SLX4 (n = 1), and BRCA2 (n = 1)], although Sanger sequencing was not applied because of the large sizes of its causative genes. Encouraging results were obtained in patients with Diamond\u2013Blackfan anemia [11/ 61, 18%; RPS26 (n = 3), RPS7 (n = 2), RPS19 (n = 2), RPL5 (n = 2), RPL35A (n = 1), and RPL11 (n = 1)] and dyskeratosis congenita [7/29, 24%; TERT (n = 3), TINF2 (n = 2), and DKC1 (n = 2)]. Five genetic diagnoses (7%) were inconsistent with clinical diagnoses, possibly because of overlapping disease phenotypes. Conclusion: Relative to conventional genetic testing, WES was found to be effective for the diagnoses of CBMFSs. Furthermore, the efficacy of WES will increase as our knowledge of gene mutations expands. In conclusion, the use of WES in clinical practice is warranted.
