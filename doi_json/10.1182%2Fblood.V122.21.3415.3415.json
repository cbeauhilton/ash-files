    "abstract_text": "Erythropoiesis is a process by which multipotent hematopoietic stem cells proliferate, differentiate and eventually form mature erythrocytes. This process contains eight distinct differentiation stages including burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E), colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E), proerythroblast, basophilic erythroblast, polychromatic erythroblast, orthochromatic erythroblast, reticulocyte and mature erythrocyte. Unlike most cell types, an important feature of erythropoiesis is that following each of the three or four mitoses that occur during terminal erythroid differentiation, the daughter cells are distinctly different from the parent cell from which they are derived. Thus, erythropoiesis is a complex process that requires tight regulation. The most extensively studied regulators of erythroid differentiation include the EPO/EPOR system and two major transcription factors, GATA1 and KLF1. In contrast to the well-established roles of growth factors, cytokines and transcription factors in regulating erythropoiesis, the regulation of erythropoiesis by other mechanisms is much less understood. In the present study, we explore the changes in DNA methylation during human terminal erythroid differentiation and DNA methylation/demethylation in human erythropoiesis. The methylation status of DNA influences many biologic processes. It has been recently reported that global demethylation occurs during both murine and human erythropoiesis. However, the dynamics of DNA methylation changes, the underlying molecular mechanism(s), and the function of DNA demethylation in erythropoiesis are not clear. To address these issues, we performed next-generation bisulfite sequencing on highly purified human erythroblasts at distinct differentiation stages. We show that while there is a global hypomethylation as terminal erythropoiesis proceeds, stage-specific analysis revealed that a significant proportion of differential methylation includes gains of methylation. Moreover, genes that presented with DNA methylation changes could be categorized into 3 groups based on the dynamics of their methylation changes. As Ten-eleven-translocation proteins (TETs) have been implicated in DNA demethylation by converting 5-methylcytosine (5mc) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmc), we attempted to explore the role of TETs in DNA demethylation and terminal erythroid differentiation. We show that 5hmc is progressively increased during human terminal erythroid differentiation. Importantly, knockdown of TET2 by shRNA in human CD34 + cells impaired the production of 5hmc as well as terminal erythroid differentiation. Our findings demonstrate the complexity of DNA methylation dynamics and identify a functional role for TET2 in human erythroid differentiation. These findings provide new and novel insights into the mechanistic understanding of normal and disordered erythropoiesis. As aberrant DNA methylation underlies many hematological diseases including the dyserythropoiesis of myelodysplastic syndromes, we suggest that these finding also provide novel insights into these diseases.
