    "abstract_text": "Introduction and objectives Hemophogocytic syndrome (HPS) is an infrequent disease in children with a high mortality rate. Currently, the diagnosis of HPS largely depends on non-specific clinical manifestations, but the clinical features allowing to meet the criteria of diagnosis of HPS usually do not appear simultaneously which make the early diagnosis very difficult. According to the literature, hypercytokinemia has been noticed for this disease. However, the pattern of hypercytokinemia in HPS has not been proposed. In this study, the quick determination of Th1/Th2 cytokines in the sera from patients with HPS was performed and the patterns of the cytokines were analyzed to seek for the possibility of using the cytokine pattern for the early diagnosis of HPS and its prognostic significance. Patients and Methods A total of 16 children with HPS based on the 2004 HPS criteria from June 2005 \u223c December 2006 were enrolled into this study. Peripheral blood samples were collected at the time of diagnosis, during the induction therapy and at the time of relapse. Sera from 21 healthy children, 17 ALL at remission and 17 with sepsis were used as controls. A cytometric bead assay (CBA) was used to quantitatively determine the Th1/Th2 cytokines including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3. Results Levels of IL-6 (22.20 (10.60\u2013139.25) pg/ml), IL-10 (195.60(63.85\u2013918.70)pg/ml) and IFN\u03b3 (4740.20(1054.72\u2013 >5000.00)pg/ml) from patients with HPS were significantly higher than those of normal control (3.35 (2.50\u20135.40) pg/ml, P < 0.05; 2.90(2.20\u20134.80)pg/ml, P5000.00)pg/ml) of IFN\u03b3 in HPS patients were much higher than those (52.80(37.50\u223c66.60)pg/ml, P5000.00)pg/ml, P=0.002) of prior to treatment. While those in patients insensitive to chemotherapy were not significantly reduced (P > 0.05). No significant differences in the IL-2, IL-4 and TNF\u03b1 levels among patients at acute phase, remission stage and the healthy controls were observed. Univariate analysis showed that the initial IL-10 level >100pg/ml and IFN\u03b3 concentration > 4000pg/ml were both unfavorable prognostic factors for HPS (IFN\u03b3, P =0.034; IL-10, P=0.034). Positive correlations between the levels of IFN\u03b3 and IL-10(r=0.893, P<0.001), IFN\u03b3 and IL-6(r=0.791, P<0.001), IL-10 and IL-6(r=0.676, P<0.001) were found. All of the three parameters stayed at a high level in acute phase and returned to normal when achieving remission. Conclusion s The quick determination of Th1/Th2 cytokines is a useful approach for the early and quick diagnosis in HPS patients based on the pattern of significant elevations of IFN\u03b3 and IL-10 with slight elevation of IL-6 and it can be used for the monitoring of the progress and the prognosis of the disease.",
