    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3426 Introduction: Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare disorder due to a somatic mutation in the hematopoietic stem cell. The introduction of highly sensitive flow cytometric and aerolysin testing have shown the presence of PNH clones in patients with a variety of other hematological disorders such as aplastic anemia (AA) and myelodysplasic syndrome (MDS). It is hypothesized that patients with these disorders and PNH clones may share an immunologic basis for marrow failure with relative protection of the PNH clone, due to their lack of cell surface expression of immune accessory proteins. This is supported by the literature showing responsiveness in AA and MDS to immunosuppressive treatments. Preliminary results from a recent multicenter trial, EXPLORE, notes that PNH clones can be seen in 70% of AA and 55% of MDS patients, and therefore there may be utility in the general screening of all patients with bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the presence of PNH cells in MDS is a predictive biomarker that is clinically important for response to immunosuppressive therapy. Methods: Our retrospective cohort study in a tertiary care center used a high sensitivity RBC and FLAER assay to detect PNH clones as small as 0.01%. Of all patients screened with this method, those with bone marrow biopsy and aspirate proven MDS, AA, or other BMF syndromes (defined as unexplained cytopenias) were analysed. Results from PNH assays were compared to other clinical and laboratory parameters such as LDH. Results: Overall, 102 patients were initially screened over a 12 month period at our center. 30 patients were excluded as they did not have biopsy or aspirate proven MDS, AA, or other BMF syndromes. Of the remaining 72 patients, four patients were found to have PNH clones, where 2/51 had MDS (both RCMD, IPSS 0) [3.92%] and 2/4 had AA [50%]. The PNH clone sizes of these four patients were 0.01%, 0.01%, 0.02%, and 1.7%. None of the MDS patients with known recurrent karyotypic abnormalities had PNH clones present. Only one of the four patients had a markedly increased serum LDH level. Conclusions: Our retrospective study indicates much lower incidence of PNH clones in MDS patients or any patients with BMF syndromes when compared to the preliminary data from the EXPLORE trial. There is also significant disagreement in other smaller cohorts in regards to the incidence of PNH in AA and MDS. Screening for PNH clones in patients with bone marrow failure needs further study before adoption of widespread use.
