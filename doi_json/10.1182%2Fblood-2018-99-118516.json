    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a disease of the elderly. It shows rapidly increasing incidence with increased age. Although MM is rare in young people, patients diagnosed before the age of 50 years account for 10% of the overall incidence and approximately 2% are diagnosed before 40 years of age. The aim of the study was to assess the clinical results of the young MM patients diagnosed at the age of \u226445 years. All the MM patients who were \u226445 years old at the time of diagnosis and who were admitted to our clinic between January 2004 and December 2017 were retrospectively assessed. There was a total of 31 patients and 14 (45.2%) of them were females and 17 (54.8%) of them were males. The mean age was 40.4\u00b13.8 years. The most frequent myeloma types were Ig G Kappa (n:12, 38.7%) and Kappa light chain (n: 10, 32.3%). The remaining types were Ig A lambda (n:4, 12.9%), Ig G lambda (n:2, 6.5%), Lambda light chain (n: 2, 6.5%) and non-secretory myeloma (n:1, 3.2%). Before transplantation 12 patients (38.7%) were in complete remission, 11 patients (35.5%) were in very good partial remission, 4 patients (12.9%) were in partial remission state and 4 patients (12.9%) had refractory disease. VAD + VCD protocol was given to 12 (38.7%) patients. 6 (19.8%) patients had VCD, 3 (9.7%) got VCD + VRD, 2 (6.5%) got VAD and 8 (25.8%) got other chemotherapy protocols. Transplantation was done in 26 patients (83.9%). Overall 9 patients (29%) died during the study period. Second or tandem transplantation was performed to 10 patients and 30% (n:3) of these re-transplanted patients died. The overall survival for these patients was estimated to be 70% (95% CI: 64.2-75.8). In conclusion MM in patients younger than 45 years is rare. In these patients Ig G Kappa and Kappa Light chain types are the most frequent types. Heterogeneous of individual patients may exist within these young myeloma patients. For those who are expected to show a poor response to current treatments despite their young age, the efficacy of an alternative therapeutic strategy such as front line allo-HSTC should be further investigated.
