    "abstract_text": "MLL ( KMT2A ) rearrangements are among the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities that occur in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Mutational landscapes in KMT2A -rearranged AML have been reported; however, most studies are missing data at relapse. Therefore, matched diagnostic and relapse samples were analyzed in this study, and the clonal evolution pattern in KMT2A -rearranged AML was examined. Further, the prognostic significance of the clonal architecture was investigated. Sixty-two diagnostic and 16 relapse samples obtained from pediatric patients with KMT2A -rearranged AML enrolled in the Japan Children's Cancer Group (JCCG) AML-05/AML-99 study were analyzed for 338 genes using targeted sequencing. The data were analyzed with the published data of 105 diagnostic and 9 relapse samples with KMT 2A-rearranged AML. Additionally, as a control, the mutation data of matched diagnostic and relapse samples of 107 patients with non- KMT2A -rearranged AML were collected. Among 25 patients with KMT2A -rearranged AML with matched data at diagnosis and relapse, mutations of signaling pathway genes ( FLT3, KRAS, NRAS, PTPN11, CBL, and BRAF ) were frequently detected in diagnostic samples (25 mutations/25 patients). However, 21 of 25 (84.0%) mutations were lost at relapse. In contrast, 7 of 19 (36.8%) mutations of other pathway genes were lost at relapse, and the percentage was significantly lower than that of mutations in the signaling pathway genes ( P = 0.002). Six mutations in the signaling pathway genes and 11 mutations in other pathway genes were acquired at relapse. Particularly, mutations of transcription factor genes ( WT1, SPI1, GATA2 , and RUNX1 ) were acquired at relapse: 7 of 8 (87.5%) mutations were detected only at relapse. These results suggest that mutations of signaling pathway genes are unstable in the clonal evolution of KMT2A -rearranged AML. Mutations of other pathway genes, especially those of transcription factor genes, may contribute to relapse in patients with KMT2A -rearranged AML. Next, attention was turned to the KRAS mutations ( KRAS -MT) because we have previously shown that KRAS -MT are independent adverse prognostic factors in KMT2A -rearranged AML ( Blood Adv. 2020). Among 25 patients with KMT2A -rearranged AML with matched data at diagnosis and relapse, 10 (40.0%) patients harbored KRAS -MT at diagnosis. Interestingly, KRAS -MT were lost at relapse in 9 of 10 (90.0%) patients. Among 107 patients with non- KMT2A -rearranged AML with matched data at diagnosis and relapse, 10 (9.3%) patients harbored KRAS -MT at diagnosis. The frequency of KRAS -MT was significantly higher in KMT2A -rearranged AML (40.0% vs. 9.3%, P = 0.0006). This may be explained on the basis of the fact that KRAS -MT is associated with a high relapse rate in KMT2A -rearranged AML, but not in non- KMT2A -rearranged AML. KRAS -MT was lost at relapse in 5 of 10 (50.0%) patients with non- KMT2A -rearranged AML. The percentage of KRAS -MT loss at relapse was higher in KMT2A -rearranged AML. However, it was not statistically significant (90.0% vs. 50.0%, P = 0.14). Therefore, KRAS -MT may be unstable in clonal evolution regardless of disease subtypes in AML. The underlying mechanisms of the paradox between the high relapse rate in patients with KRAS -MT and frequent loss of KRAS -MT at relapse in patients with KMT2A -rearranged AML should be examined in future studies. The loss of KRAS -MT at relapse suggests that the mutations were in subclones at diagnosis. Therefore, we finally examined the prognosis of 167 patients according to the clonality of KRAS -MT at diagnosis. In patients with KMT2A-MLLT3 (n = 67), those with subclonal KRAS -MT (n = 6) had adverse 5-y event-free survival compared with both patients with wild-type KRAS ( KRAS -WT) (n = 56) ( KRAS -WT vs. subclonal KRAS -MT: 58.7% vs. 16.7%, P = 0.04) and patients with clonal KRAS -MT (n = 5) (clonal KRAS -MT vs. subclonal KRAS -MT: 80.0% vs. 16.7%, P = 0.07). However, 5-y overall survival (OS) was similar among the three groups. In contrast, among patients with KMT2A-MLLT10 (n = 37), those with clonal KRAS -MT (n = 5) had adverse 5-y OS compared with both patients with KRAS -WT (n = 20) ( KRAS -WT vs. clonal KRAS -MT: 59.7% vs. 0.0%, P = 0.006) and patients with subclonal KRAS -MT (n = 12) (subclonal KRAS -MT vs. clonal KRAS -MT: 58.3% vs. 0.0%, P = 0.04). According to these results, the effects of the clonality of KRAS -MT on prognosis may depend on which KMT2A fusion is present.
