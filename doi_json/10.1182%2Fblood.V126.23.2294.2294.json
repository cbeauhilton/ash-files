    "abstract_text": "Background: The phase 3 B-LONG study demonstrated the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of recombinant factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) for the prevention and treatment of bleeding episodes in subjects with severe hemophilia B. For people with hemophilia, frequent bleeding events occur in target joints, which are a known precursor to hemophilic arthropathy (chronic joint disease). There is currently limited information available on the outcomes of prophylaxis in subjects with target joints who have severe hemophilia B. Aims: To assess the frequency of bleeding events and the dosing of rFIXFc in subjects who had \u22651 target joint at baseline in the B-LONG study. Methods: B-LONG was a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label study that enrolled males aged \u226512 years with severe hemophilia B (\u22642 IU/dL endogenous FIX activity) who had received prior treatment with FIX. Subjects in B-LONG were enrolled into 1 of 4 arms: Arm 1, weekly prophylaxis; Arm 2, individualized interval prophylaxis; Arm 3, episodic treatment; or Arm 4, perioperative management. For the current post-hoc analysis, subjects with \u22651 target joint at baseline (per protocol, a target joint was defined as a major joint with \u22653 bleeding episodes in a 3-month period) and who received on-study rFIXFc prophylaxis (Arms 1 and 2 only) were included. On-study per subject target joint ABR (annualized number of bleeding episodes per year in all target joints combined), including overall, spontaneous, and traumatic target joint ABR, were assessed. In subjects with available prestudy and on-study ABR data, prestudy 12-month bleeding rates were compared with on-study overall ABR. Results: Forty-three subjects from the prophylaxis arms had target joints at entry into B-LONG and data collected during the efficacy period of the study (weekly prophylaxis, n = 35; individualized interval prophylaxis, n = 8). Of these, 40 subjects had both prestudy and on-study bleeding information available. Regardless of prestudy treatment regimen (prophylactic or episodic rFIX), on-study median ABRs were low among subjects with target joints at baseline compared with prestudy ABRs (Fig. 1). The on-study overall target joint, spontaneous target joint, and traumatic target joint median (interquartile range, [IQR]) ABRs were low for subjects in the weekly prophylaxis arm (1.03 [0.00, 3.07], 0.00 [0.00, 1.10], and 0.00 [0.00, 1.11], respectively) and for subjects in the individualized interval prophylaxis arm (2.20 [0.00, 3.75], 2.20 [0.00, 3.75], and 0.00 [0.00, 0.00], respectively; Fig. 2). A total of 17 (48.6%) subjects receiving weekly prophylaxis and 3 (37.5%) subjects receiving individualized interval prophylaxis had no target joint bleeding episodes on-study. The average weekly prophylactic rFIXFc dose for subjects with target joints at baseline was (median [IQR]) 46.26 (37.98, 54.55) IU/kg and 69.48 (57.28, 77.45) IU/kg for those receiving weekly prophylaxis and individualized interval prophylaxis, respectively. The median (IQR) average on-study dosing intervals for these groups were 6.98 (6.88, 7.00) days and 10.25 (9.45, 12.72) days, respectively. Among subjects with target joints at baseline who received prestudy rFIX and on-study rFIXFc prophylaxis (n = 6, weekly prophylaxis arm only; no subjects from the individualized interval prophylaxis arm who met these criteria had available data), the on-study median (IQR) average weekly prophylactic dose of 50.61 (39.61, 60.61) IU/kg with rFIXFc was lower than the prestudy median (IQR) average weekly prophylactic dose of 111.28 (95.56, 116.76) IU/kg with rFIX. Additionally, the on-study median (IQR) dosing interval (6.92 [6.79, 6.97]) with rFIXFc prophylaxis was longer than the pre-study median (IQR) dosing interval among these 6 subjects (3.50 [2.33, 3.50] days). Summary/Conclusion: For subjects in the current analysis with severe hemophilia B who entered B-LONG with target joints, rFIXFc prophylaxis was effective for reducing the frequency of bleeding episodes overall and in target joints. Furthermore, in subjects who received prestudy and on-study prophylaxis, rFIXFc was associated with reduced consumption and prolonged dosing intervals compared with conventional prestudy rFIX products. These results suggest that target joints can be effectively managed and controlled with rFIXFc dosed prophylactically every 1 to 2 weeks.
