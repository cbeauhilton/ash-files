    "abstract_text": "Imatinib is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor effective against Abl kinases, c-Kit and platelet-derived growth-factor receptor (PDGF-R) and is currently used for the treatment of patients with CML and GIST. However, little is known about the effects of imatinib on function and differentiation of non-transformed normal cells. Using this compound, we show that human monocyte derived DC generated in the presence of therapeutic concentrations of imatinib show a concentration dependent reduced expression of CD1a, HLA and co-stimulatory molecules as well as decreased activation-induced secretion of chemokines and cytokines involved in T cell activation. Moreover, exposure to imatinib reduces the capacity of DC to prime T cell responses that cannot be restored by the addition of IL-12 and which is not due to induction of apoptosis or IL-10 secretion. Using Western blot analyses we found that these effects are mediated by a pronounced downregulation of nuclear localized protein levels of NF-kB family members RelB, RelA and NF-kB p50. Furthermore, imatinib treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, indicating the involvement of the PI3 kinase pathways while not affecting the phosphorylation state of p38 and ERK1 MAP kinase. In line with these results, incubation of monocytes with PI3 kinase inhibitors resulted in a similar phenotype of DC as described above. Gene expression profiling utilizing DNA microarrays revealed upregulation of lysosomal genes and molecules preferentially expressed in monocytes/macrophages. However, in contrast to these observations, imatinib treatment had no effect on the incorporation of latex beads by DC and resulted in a reduced FITC-labeled dextran uptake. Importantly, utilizing blocking antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors we demonstrate that the inhibitory effects of imatinib on DC differentiation are not mediated by PDGF-R and c-Kit but most likely via c-Abl tyrosine kinase. These results demonstrate that imatinib affects the antigen presenting function of DC on several levels: their phenotype, antigen uptake and processing as well as production of cytokines and chemokines.",
