    "abstract_text": "Background and aim of the work: Bone marrow failure syndromes (BMFS) includes inherited and acquired conditions. Inherited bone marrow failure includes a number of syndromes; with Fanconi anemia (FA) being the most common one of them. Telomeres are eroded with cell division, but in hematopoietic stem cell, maintenance of their length is mediated by telomerase. Short telomeres can result in instability of cell function where diseases occur. Bone Marrow Failure might be developed due to low telomerase activity or short telomeres. Our study is aiming to evaluate the utility of Real Time Quantitative-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) in measuring the relative telomere length and its significance in diagnosis and prognosis of patients with BMFS. Materials and methods: The study includes 3 groups: A group of congenital BMF (29 patients), a group of acquired BMF (10 patients) and a third control group (15 cases). The relative telomere length is evaluated for them using RT-qPCR. Results: We have found that there is a significant difference in relative telomere length between congenital group and controls (p=0.001), also a significant difference between acquired group and controls (p= 0.029). However, there is no significant difference between congenital and acquired groups (p= 0.479). There is no significant correlation between the telomere length and the overall survival or prognosis of the patients of BMFS. Conclusion: We conclude that the telomere length is significantly altered in patients with BMFS whether being congenital or acquired compared to the control group.
