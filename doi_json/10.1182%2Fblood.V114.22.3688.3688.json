    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3688 Poster Board III-624 Quiescence of circulating nai\u0308ve T cells is maintained by the transcription factors ELF4 and KLF4 downstream of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Hence, loss of ELF4 leads to increased proliferation of CD8+ T cells in response to homeostatic and antigen driven stimuli (Yamada et al, Nature Immunology, 2009). The identification of signals that suppress this restraint of proliferation will aid to enhance immunological memory during vaccination and to better understand development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias. Consistent with lower threshold of activation by ELF4 deletion in unstimulated nai\u0308ve T cells, we identified a significant downregulation of the dual-specificity phosphatases DUSP1 and DUSP5 in a global gene expression study, which was confirmed at a protein level. Consequently, Elf4\u2212/\u2212 CD8 T cells showed sustained phosphorylation of Erk1/2 upon TCR activation. In addition, we found that the PD98059 and LY294002 inhibitors, but not Cyclosporin A, blocked inhibition of ELF4 transcription upon TCR activation independently of CD28 co-stimulation and signals emanating from IL-2R. Furthermore, rapamycin also prevented downregulation of ELF4 transcripts following T cell activation, suggesting that mTORC1 inhibits ELF4 transcription downstream of MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. We conclude that the transcription factor ELF4 sets a proliferation threshold in nai\u0308ve T cells by activating DUSPs and that ELF4 suppression upon TCR activation is mediated by mTORC1 downstream of MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. Our findings provide important targets of this novel control of T cell proliferation to enhance immune response to vaccination and to prevent expansion of pre-leukemic clones in pediatric patients that fail to respond to current therapies.
