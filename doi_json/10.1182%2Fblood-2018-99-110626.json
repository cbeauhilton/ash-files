    "abstract_text": "The C/EBP\u03b1 transcription factor plays a pivotal role in myeloid differentiation and E2F-mediated cell cycle regulation. Although CEBPA mutations are common in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), little is known regarding pre-leukemic alterations caused by mutated CEBPA . Here, we investigated early events involved in pre-leukemic transformation driven by CEBPA N321D in the LMPP-like cell line Hoxb8-FL (Redecke et al. , Nat Methods 2013), which can be maintained in vitro as a self-renewing LMPP population using Flt3L and estradiol, as well as differentiated both in vitro and in vivo into myeloid and lymphoid cell types. Hoxb8-FL cells were retrovirally transduced with Empty Vector (EV), wild-type CEBPA ( CEBPA WT) or its N321D mutant form ( CEBPA N321D). CEBPA WT-transduced cells showed increased expression of cd11b and SIRP\u03b1 and downregulation of c-kit, suggesting that wild-type CEBPA was sufficient to promote differentiation even under LMPP growth conditions. Interestingly, we did not observe the same phenotype in CEBPA N321D-transduced cells. Upon withdrawal of estradiol, both EV and CEBPA WT-transduced cells differentiated rapidly into a conventional dendritic cell (cDC) phenotype by day 7 and died within 12 days. By contrast, CEBPA N321D-transduced cells continued to grow for in excess of 56 days, with an initial cDC phenotype but by day 30 demonstrating a plasmacytoid dendritic cell precursor phenotype. CEBPA N321D-transduced cells were morphologically distinct from EV-transduced cells. To test leukemogenic potential in vivo , we performed transplantation experiments in lethally irradiated mice. Serial monitoring of peripheral blood demonstrated that Hoxb8-FL derived cells had disappeared by 4 weeks, and did not reappear. However, at 6 months CEBPA N321D-transduced cells could still be detected in bone marrow in contrast to EV-transduced cells but without any leukemic phenotype. To identify early events involved in pre-leukemic transformation, the differentiation profiles of EV, CEBPA WT and CEBPA N321D-transduced cells were examined with single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). 576 single cells were taken from 3 biological replicates at days 0 and 5 post-differentiation, and analysed using the Automated Single-Cell Analysis Pipeline (Gardeux et al. , Bioinformatics 2017). Visualisation by t-SNE (Fig 1) demonstrated: (i) CEBPA WT-transduced cells formed a distinct cluster at day 0 before withdrawal of estradiol; (ii) CEBPA N321D-transduced cells separated from EV and CEBPA WT-transduced cells after 5 days of differentiation, (iii) two subpopulations could be identified within the CEBPA N321D-transduced cells at day 5, with a cluster of five CEBPA N321D-transduced single cells distributed amongst or very close to the day 0 non-differentiated cells. Differential expression analysis identified 224 genes upregulated and 633 genes downregulated specifically in the CEBPA N321D-transduced cells when compared to EV cells after 5 days of differentiation. This gene expression signature revealed that CEBPA N321D-transduced cells switched on a HSC/MEP/CMP transcriptional program and switched off a myeloid dendritic cell program. Finally, in order to further dissect the effect of the N321D mutation, the binding profile of endogenous and CEBPA N321D was compared by ChIP-seq before and after 5 days of differentiation. Integration with scRNA-seq data identified 160 genes specifically downregulated in CEBPA N321D-transduced cells which were associated with the binding of the mutant protein. This list of genes included genes previously implicated in dendritic cell differentiation (such as NOTCH2 , JAK2 ), as well as a number of genes not previously implicated in the evolution of AML, representing potentially novel therapeutic targets.
