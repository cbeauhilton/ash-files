    "abstract_text": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer of childhood resulting from the clonal proliferation of lymphoid precursors with arrested maturation. Chemotherapy can induce complete remission in more than 95% of cases of childhood ALL and achieve long-term survival in 70\u201380% of cases. However, ALL with the t(9:22) BCR-ABL translocation or Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) are still highly resistant to chemotherapy from the onset. Thus, new therapeutic approaches are required to improve their prognosis. Characterization of the growth requirement of ALL cells suggest that these cancers are dependent on various cytokines via paracrine and/or autocrine mechanism in which the JAK family of proteins are closely implicated. Accordingly, tyrosine kinase inhibitors against JAKs are expected to become a new class of anti-tumor agents against these cancers. Curcumin has been shown to inhibit JAK-STAT pathway in a variety of hematological malignancies including multiple myeloma and primary effusion lymphomas. We therefore sought to determine whether curcumin suppresses the growth of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We tested a panel of preB-ALL cell lines with various translocations after treatment with different doses of curcumin. The cell lines included REH (t12:21), RS4:11 (t4:11), 697 (t1:19) and SupB15(t9:22). Cell viability decreased in a concentration-dependent manner in 697, REH and RS4:11 with curcumin (0\u201340mM) whereas only minimal changes in viability was detected in SupB15. Curcumin induced apoptosis in all preB-ALL cell lines except SupB15 that was found to be refractory to curcumin treatment. Curcumin induced apoptosis via truncation of BID, loss of mitochondrial potential as determined by JC1 staining with subsequent release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, and activation of caspase 3 and PARP. Curcumin treatment also caused the down-regulation of the IAPs, cIAP1 and XIAP. All these events occured in the sensitive cell lines 697, REH and RS4:11, however, in SupB15, curcumin failed to inhibit the expression of cIAP1 and XIAP and remained refractory to treatment. These results suggest that the IAPs may play an important role in curcumin induced apoptosis in preB-ALL cells. Altogether, our findings suggests a novel function for curcumin, acting as a growth suppressor of most preB-ALL cells and inducing apoptosis via down-regulation of IAPs. Therefore, curcumin may have a future therapeutic role in preB-ALL and possibly other malignancies.",
