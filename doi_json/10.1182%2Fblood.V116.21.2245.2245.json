    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2245 Background: High dose chemo/radiotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation (HSCT) is indicated in several pediatric malignant disorders such as neuroblastoma and relapsed Hodgkin's disease. Ideally, 2\u20135 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg should be infused during autologous peripheral blood (PB) HSCT to support timely and durable engraftment and improve transplant outcomes. In patients who have received repetitive cycles of intensive chemotherapy, this target is not always achieved with standard mobilization regimens. Plerixafor, a novel CXCR4 antagonist, when combined with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), can safely and predictably mobilize adequate numbers of CD34+ HSC to support transplantation in adult patients with myeloma and lymphoma. We report on the safety and efficacy of PB HSC mobilization with plerixafor + G-CSF in pediatric patients with cancer. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of all children with various malignant disorders who were enrolled in the US plerixafor compassionate use program (CUP; NCT00291811 ). Patients who had previously failed HSC mobilization (defined as the inability to collect \u22652 x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg or achieve an adequate PB CD34+ cell count, typically \u226510 CD34+ cells/\u03bcl) with growth factor +/\u2212 chemotherapy were treated with plerixafor + G-CSF. The goal was to collect \u22652 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg for autologous HSCT. G-CSF (10\u03bcg/kg SC) was administered daily for 5 days. Plerixafor (0.24 mg/kg SC) was given in the evening on Day 4, ~11 hours prior to apheresis. Plerixafor, G-CSF and apheresis were repeated daily until \u22652 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg had been collected. Results: A total of 16 patients with non Hodgkin's lymphoma (3), Hodgkin's disease (1), CNS tumors (4), Ewing's sarcoma (4), neuroblastoma (2), osteogenic sarcoma (1) and desmoplastic small cell tumor (1) underwent the procedure. The median age was 14 years and 7 (44%) patients were male. In previous mobilization attempts, 5 patients failed to collect the minimum transplantable cell dose with a median yield of 0.44 x10 6 (range: 0.17\u20132.2 \u00d7 10 6 ) CD34+ cells/kg. Apheresis was never attempted in11 patients due to low PB CD34+ cell levels; median cells/\u03bcl was 1.0 (range, 0.01\u201312) in 9 patients with available data. Initial mobilization regimens included growth factor alone in 6 patients and growth factor + chemotherapy in 9 patients (data unavailable for 1 patient). When re-challenged for mobilization with plerixafor + G-CSF, 14 (88%) patients successfully collected \u22652 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg; this included all 4 (100%) patients with lymphoma and 10 (83%) patients with solid tumors. The median time to collect the target cell dose was 1.5 days (range 1\u20135 days). The median CD34+ cell yield from all patients was 3.5 \u00d7 10 6 cells/kg (range 0.96 \u2013 9.80 \u00d7 10 6 ); patients with lymphoma and solid tumors collected a median of 7.2 (range 3.2 \u2013 7.9) \u00d7 10 6 and 3.3 (range 0.96 \u20139.8) \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg, respectively. Eleven (69%) patients proceeded to transplant including all 4 (100%) patients with lymphoma and 7 (58%) patients with solid tumors. One patient with neuroblastoma received a tandem transplant. The median infused cell dose was 4.18 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg (range 1.7 \u2013 7.6 \u00d7 10 6 ). The median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 14 and 33 days, respectively. Plerixafor-related adverse events were mostly mild, and observed in 5 (31%) patients. They included administration site reactions (4), vomiting (2), nausea (1) and oral paraesthesia (1). No patient experienced a serious adverse event. Conclusions: Treatment with plerixafor + G-CSF safely and effectively mobilized HSC in the majority of pediatric patients with malignant disorders after failure of standard mobilization with growth factor \u00b1 chemotherapy. Successful stem cell mobilization allowed consideration of autologous HSCT when indicated. Mobilization with plerixafor was safe and resulted in prompt engraftment. Many of these patients could not have proceeded to transplant without this intervention.
