    "abstract_text": "PURPOSE: Recent advances in understanding of the molecular alterations that occur at the genetic and epigenetic levels in Multiple Myeloma (MM) have led to major leaps in identifying molecular pathways that regulate progression and resistance to therapeutic agents. However, despite great scientific advances at the genomic level, studies to identify signaling pathways deregulated at the functional proteomic level in MM are limited. In this study, we used a rapid and reproducible antibody-based protein microarray technique to screen the functional differences between malignant plasma cells in samples obtained from patients with MM compared to normal plasma cells (NPC) from the bone marrow of healthy volunteers. METHODS: We determined the protein expression level of 512 polypeptides in 12 samples of newly diagnosed patients with MM using high-throughput proteomic analysis with antibody-based protein microarray. Primary CD138+ sorted MM cells were obtained from the bone marrow of patients after informed consent. MM1.S was used in this study. Using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were confirmed. Lentivirus was used to knockdown CRIK. Gene expression datasets from the Mayo Clinic (accession number GSE 6477) and the UAMS (accession number GSE 2658) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus for analysis. The Mayo dataset was generated using Affymetrix U133A platform whereas the UAMS dataset was generated using Affymetrix U133plus 2.0 platform. RESULTS: We identified four subgroups of MM using unsupervised clustering analysis. We confirmed overexpression of some of these proteins including CRIK and CDK4 using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Many of these proteins are known to be deregulated in MM, indicating that this technique can accurately identify proteins that are over or under-expressed in MM in a high-throughput fashion. In addition, we identified novel proteins that are not previously known to be differentially expressed in MM, including the small GTPase member of the Rho family, CRIK protein. We then showed using knockdown of CRIK that this novel protein specifically regulates migration and adhesion in MM. There was no effect on survival of MM cells using the CRIK knockdown. Analyzing the GEP data of the 15 NPC, 46 monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or smoldering myeloma (SMM) and 101 MM samples from the Mayo Clinic, there was a significant increase in expression of CIT from NPC to MM. Among the 351 patients entered into TTII trials from UAMS, CIT expression was similar across the different TC class. Using a cut-off normalized expression level of 1.25 (a level above expression in NPC), MM with a high CIT expression (n=81) had a significantly shorter survival than the other patients. CONCLUSION: In this study, we show that MM cells express a high level of CRIK, and that inhibition of this protein leads to significant inhibition of adhesion and migration of MM cells. In addition, CRIK protein expression correlated with CIT gene expression, with high expression in MM samples compared to NPC. In addition, high CIT expression correlated with poor survival in patients with MM.",
