    "abstract_text": "About 500 persons in Japan are estimated to have thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), which is a life-threatening disorder. In contrast with the USA and EU, off-label use of rituximab for TTP is not allowed by the Japanese public health insurance system. We therefore have limited experience of the effects of rituximab in Japanese patients with adult TTP and have not investigated possible ethnicity-related differences in its effects. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of rituximab in Japanese adult patients with TTP, we conducted an investigator-initiated phase 2 clinical trial in Japan between January and December of 2014. This study was sponsored by the Japanese government and the study design was based instructions from the regulatory agency, PMDA (Phamaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency). Adult Japanese patients with acquired TTP that had proven refractory to at least five plasma exchanges (PEX) or had serum concentrations of more than 2 BU/mL of ADAMTS13 inhibitor or both were eligible for this study. Rituximab was infused at 375 mg/m 2 weekly for 4 weeks. The study protocol allowed use of both plasma exchange and corticosteroids with the investigational drug. Thirteen patients were registered and seven found to be eligible and treated with rituximab. All seven patients were evaluable for safety and six for efficacy. Three of these six (50%) were women; the median age was 41.5 years. Median platelet counts at baseline were 22 \u00d7 10 9 /L. All of these six patients were refractory to previous PEX and ADMTS13 inhibitor concentrations were higher than 2 BU/mL in two (33%) of them. All six patients no longer required PEX after receiving rituximab treatment. Five (83%) and two (33%) patients achieved platelet counts of 100 \u00d7 10 9 /L and 150 \u00d7 10 9 /L 4 weeks after initiating rituximab, respectively. Median platelet counts at week 4 after commencing rituximab were 136 \u00d7 10 9 /L (range: 64-201 \u00d7 10 9 /L). The median time from initiating PEX to achieving platelet counts over 150 \u00d7 10 9 /L was 22 days. By the study endpoint (4 weeks after initiating rituximab treatment), ADAMTS13 activity had normalized to 77.3% from 3.4%, accompanied by disappearance of ADAMTS13 inhibitor. Both anemia and neurological impairment also improved in all patients. The median percentages of peripheral blood CD20-positive B cells were 22.9% and 0.2% before and at the completion of treatment with rituximab, respectively. Serum IgG decreased slightly from 1,116 mg/dL at baseline to 921 mg/dL 4 weeks after rituximab treatment. Five of seven patients experienced adverse events, two of which were severe; namely septic shock and cytomegalovirus infection; no patients died. No unpublished severe adverse events were noted. No recurrence of TTP occurred during a median follow-up of 7 months. These data suggest that rituximab is safe and effective for acute refractory/high risk acquired TTP in Japanese patients and that there are no ethnic differences in effectiveness or safety of rituximab for adult TTP. However, there were too few patients to draw any firm conclusions. Further investigation is necessary to optimize the treatment schedule of rituximab. We are preparing to apply to the Japanese regulatory agency for approval of new indications for rituximab for TTP.
