    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2226 Objective: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare syndrome, with our group having identified the thienopyridines ticlopidine and clopidogrel as the most common drugs associated with TTP in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) databases. We review clinical, epidemiologic, laboratory, and drug safety findings for thienopyridine-associated TTP, including the first reported cases with prasugrel, a thienopyridine approved in 2009. Methods: Data sources included FDA's Adverse Event Reports database, pharmaceutical manufacturers, package inserts, physician surveys, phase III reports, insurance databases, and an epidemiologic study (1989\u20132011). Causality was assessed with the World Health Organization scale. Results: Since 2002, FDA received reports of 10 ticlopidine-, 140 clopidogrel-, and nine prasugrel-associated TTP cases, including four, 11, and 9 cases respectively, in the first year of marketing of each agent. Surveys of hematologists by our group identified 32 ticlopidine- and ten clopidogrel-associated TTP cases. Thienopyridines were administered for > two weeks for 90% of 93 ticlopidine-associated cases, 26% of 35 cases clopidogrel-associated cases, and none of nine prasugrel-associated cases. In the Phase III setting, one of 2,932 ticlopidine-, none of 27,961 clopidogrel-, and none of 1,769 prasugrel-treated patients developed TTP. Insurance databases identified three clopidogrel-associated TTP case among 15.3 million individuals. Ticlopidine- (n=30) versus clopidogrel-associated TTP patients (n=8) presented with severe ADAMTS13-deficiency (80% versus 0%) and neutralizing auto-antibodies to ADAMTS13 (100% versus 0%) and had higher survival rates following therapeutic plasma exchange (87% versus 50%) (p<0.05). Greater than 95% of ticlopidine-associated TTP cases were assessed as having a probable causal relationship versus none of the clopidogrel- or prasugrel-associated TTP cases. TTP is described in a Black Box warning for ticlopidine (1998, incidence of 1 in 2,000) and as a warning for clopidogrel (2000; 12 per million) and prasugrel (2010; no incidence reported) Conclusion: TTP is associated with all thienopyridines, although causal relationships remain under active investigations.
