Although the risk for infections increases with longer duration of neutropenia, no attempts have been undertaken to predict time of neutrophil recovery in AML/MDS patients following intensive chemotherapy. In unpublished work, we have successfully used mathematical modeling of peripheral blood blast kinetics following induction chemotherapy to accurately predict the likelihood of subsequent complete remission (CR). In this retrospective study, we investigated whether data derived from mathematical modeling of early peripheral blood neutrophil or blast dynamics could predict the duration of CIN in AML/MDS patients undergoing intensive induction chemotherapy. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 59 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed AML or MDS who achieved CR after induction chemotherapy after 1 course of chemotherapy with a 7 + 3-like regimen. Daily peripheral blood neutrophil and blast counts were recorded from the initiation of chemotherapy until the day of neutrophil recovery (defined as an absolute neutrophil count [ANC] \u2265 500 cells/\u03bcL). In patients with \u2265 3 measurable neutrophil or blast counts within the first five days of data collection, the rate of peripheral blood neutrophil and blast clearance was calculated by fitting an exponential decay curve to the data points starting on day 1 of chemotherapy. Results: The average age of the study cohort was 54 years (range 25 to 78). Seventy-six percent had primary AML. Cytogenetic risk was favorable in 32%, intermediate in 37%, and adverse in 27% of patients. The 23 patients with initial ANC < 500 cells/\u03bcL had a significantly longer duration of neutropenia than the 36 patients with initial ANC \u2265 500 cells/\u03bcL (mean: 29 versus 26 days, range: 21 \u2013 39 versus 21 \u2013 34, p=0.045). Neither age nor percentage of blasts in the bone marrow at diagnosis predicted neutropenia duration. In patients for whom decay rates could be modeled, there was no association between duration of neutropenia and decay rate for neutrophils (n = 36) or blasts (n = 20). There was also no association with the day that neutrophils first started to decline (defined as the first drop < 70% of the initial neutrophil count) or the first day of blast clearance from peripheral blood. Seven patients received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; 1 prior to chemotherapy for antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome and 6 between days 15 and 43 for prolonged neutropenia and/or febrile neutropenia); the duration of neutropenia in this group did not differ significantly from that of the cohort as a whole. Conclusion: While kinetics of normal blood counts following initiation of intensive chemotherapy do not appear helpful to predict the duration of subsequent neutropenia, pre-treatment ANC levels provide limited information, with patients who are severely neutropenic prior to induction chemotherapy for AML having a longer average duration of CIN. This observation may provide some clinical guidance on the risk-adapted use of G-CSF in patients with AML/MDS undergoing induction chemotherapy.
