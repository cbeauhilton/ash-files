    "abstract_text": "We have previously shown that bone marrow (BM) cells from adult mice with conditional ablation of \u03b14 integrin transplanted into lethally-irradiated recipients have a partial impairment in their homing and especially their short-term engraftment (MCB, 23:9349, 2003). However, the ability of \u03b14\u2212/\u2212 stem cells (HSC) to maintain post-transplant long-term hematopoiesis and to self renew was not tested. Therefore, we performed competitive repopulation experiments: \u03b14+/+ cells mixed in equal proportions with \u03b14\u2212/\u2212 cells (verified by FACS) were given to each of 10 lethally irradiated recipients (0.5x10 6 /mouse). At 30, 100, 200, and 298 days post-transplant, engraftment was evaluated in blood (PB) and BM. By d. 200, 7 of the 9 surviving mice had 81.6\u00b13% \u03b14+/+ cells in their PB and 97.5\u00b10.1% in their BM. In the remaining 2 mice the proportion of \u03b14+/+ PB cells was 35.6\u00b112%, however by d. 298 increased (93.4\u00b12.5% in BM). To overcome a putative partial homing defect for long-term repopulating cells, similar to the one documented using a surrogate CFU-C assay, we repeated the competitive repopulation experiment using not only 1:1, but an increased ratio of \u03b14\u2212/\u2212 cells to 3:1 (or 6:1 by CFU-C ratio) given in splenectomized recipients. By 12 wks \u03b14+/+ cells among Gr1+ were 77\u00b13.7% in PB in 10 mice with 1:1 initial transplant and 79\u00b13.8% in 10 given 3:1 cells. These results showed that 4+/+ cells greatly outcompete the \u03b14\u2212/\u2212cells and contributions by \u03b14\u2212/\u2212 cells are lost early and late post-transplant. Further insight was provided by transplantation of \u03b14\u2212/\u2212 HSC without competitor cells. 12 mice transplanted with \u03b14\u2212/\u2212 BM cells were sacrificed at 2 wks (6 mice), at 10 wks (3 mice) and 1 year (3 mice) later. Despite normal PB counts, evaluation of bone marrow and spleen at all times post-transplant showed subnormal values for progenitor cells vs. concurrently transplanted controls. 10 wks post-transplant 1 of the 3 mice sacrificed showed ~50% \u03b14+/+ cells in circulation, while the other 2 had mostly \u03b14\u2212/\u2212 cells. From the latter (pooled BM), 2\u00b0 transplants were carried out and sacrificed 14 wks later. At that time the 5 recipients had 27.5%\u00b14.7 \u03b14+/+ cells in their circulation. At 1 year the 3 primary transplant surviving mice had mostly \u03b14\u2212/\u2212 hematapoiesis and served as donors (pooled BM) for 2\u00b0 transplants (n=9), evaluated 26 wks later. 5 of 9 2\u00b0 recipients showed mostly \u03b14+/+ cells, whereas 4 recipients had a mean of 6.8\u00b11.9% \u03b14+/+ cells in their blood. Each of these 4 recipients served as a 3\u00b0 donor for 20 transplants (5/donor) which again were evaluated 25 wks later. There was a 30% survival at that time, and all 6 surviving mice were reconstituted with \u03b14+/+ cells (multi-lineage; contributed by host and not by non-ablated donor stem cells). These data suggested that although long-term repopulation can be established with \u03b14\u2212/\u2212 cells in 1\u00b0recipients, hematopoiesis is quantitatively abnormal and cannot be sustained beyond a 2\u00b0 transplant. Taken together, all our transplantation experiments provide compelling evidence that \u03b14\u2212/\u2212 HSC have a competitive disadvantage compared to +/+ cells in transplantation, and a deficit in maintaining normal hematopoiesis and stem cell self-renewal. We speculate that \u03b14\u2212/\u2212 HSC either are not settled to extramedullary niches supporting sustained hematopoiesis, or do not respond to signals emanating from the stem cell niche. Either way, the data underscore the requirement of \u03b14 integrin in the interaction of HSC with the stem cell niche in order to realize their full self-renewal potential.",
