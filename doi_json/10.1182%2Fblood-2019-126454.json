    "abstract_text": "Abstract Introduction: Inherited bleeding disorders are an important cause of menorrhagia. Aim: To determine the prevalence of inherited bleeding disorders in women with menorrhagia in the absence of systemic and pelvic pathologies. Methods: The study period was from March 2013 to September 2018. It was carried out at the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Unit II, Dow Medical College and Ruth Pfau KM Civil Hospital in Karachi. The laboratory investigations were carried out partly at Dow Diagnostic Research Laboratory and mainly at the National Institute of B lood Disease & Bone Marrow Transplant. Included in the study were young girls and women who presented with menorrhagia at menarche or in the later years of reproduction, with normal bimanual pelvic examination and pelvic ultrasound results. Results : Approximately 200 women with a mean menstrual cycle duration of 9.3+ 3.5 days were included. The mean age of the included patients was 32 years. Married women's partners were cousins in 50% of the women, while unmarried girls' parents were cousins in all cases. Platelet aggregation defect was presented in 33 (16.6%) women, von Willebrand disease in 26 (13.1%) women, factor IX deficiency in 20 (10%) women, combined defects in 29 (14.6%) women, and factor VII and VIII deficiencies in 4 and 11 (2%, 5.5%) women, respectively. Isolated defect with ADP, epinephrine, and collagen were decreased in 35 (17.6%), 41 (20%), and 33 (16%) women, respectively. Conclusion: Inherited bleeding disorders were a common cause of menorrhagia in our population. Consanguinity was frequently seen in these subjects. Except for some forms of VWD, all other disorders have an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. After excluding gynecological and medical causes, a work up for inherited bleeding disorders should be advised.
