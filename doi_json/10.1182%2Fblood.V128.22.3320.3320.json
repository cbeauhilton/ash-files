    "abstract_text": "Inhibition of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins is a promising therapeutic strategy for various hematologic malignancies. Previous studies suggest that BET inhibitors constrain tumor cell proliferation and survival mainly through suppression of MYC transcription and activity. However, suppression of the transcription of additional genes also contributes to the anti-tumor activity of BET inhibitors but is less well understood. Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of CPI-0610, a novel BET inhibitor that is currently in a phase I clinical trial in relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02157636). CPI-0610 displays potent in vitro cytotoxicity against MM cell lines and patient-derived MM cells by inducing G 1 cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, CPI-0610-mediated BET inhibition overcomes the protective effects conferred by cytokines and bone marrow stromal cells. We also confirmed the in vivo efficacy of CPI-0610 in a MM xenograft mouse model. CPI-0610 significantly delayed tumor growth and increased the survival of MM-bearing SCID mice. Our study found IKZF1 and IRF4 to be among the primary targets of CPI-0610, along with MYC . These findings indicate that BET inhibition not only results in a robust reduction of MYC transcription and activity but also suppresses the expression of IKZF1 and IRF4 in MM. Given that immunomodulatory drugs stabilize cereblon and facilitate Ikaros degradation in MM cells, we combined it with CPI-0610. Combination studies of CPI-0610 with lenalidomide or pomalidomide show in vitro synergism, in part due to concomitant suppression of IKZF1 , IRF4 , and MYC , providing a rationale for clinical testing of this drug combination in MM patients.
