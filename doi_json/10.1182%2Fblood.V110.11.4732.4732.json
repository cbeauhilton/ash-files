    "abstract_text": "Objective To analysis the occurrence and prognosis related factors in renal dysfunction with multiple myeloma(MM). Methods Seventy-four cases with MM were enrolled in this study. The risk factors of occurrence and prognosis were analyzed. Results The incidence of renal dysfunction (RD) with MM was 56.8%, Age, hypertention, hemoglobin, serum ALB and GLO levels, serum \u03b2 2 MG, serum calcium and phosphonium level, the percentage of myeloma cells in bone marrow, types of MM, Durie-Salmon stage were the single factors associated with the incidence of RD with MM. Hypertention, serum \u03b2 2 MG and ALB levels were the multiple factors associated with the incidence of RD with MM. ALB was the protection factor and the other two were risk factors. The renal function recovered rapidly in the patients who received CR or received blood transfusion. The patients with renal dysfunction survived shorter (28\u00b15months) than those with normal renal function (42\u00b16months). Renal dysfunction caused more MM patients death(84.6%) in 3 months. Conclusion Hypertention and high tumor burden were the risk factors of renal dysfunction in MM, effective chemothemapy and support treatment help renal function recovery.",
