    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4670 Background: Acute Hemolytic Reactions (AHR) and Intravascular Hemolysis (IVH) have been reported rarely with Rh (D) Immune Globulin (WinRho \u00ae SDF) administration for normalization of platelet count in ITP. The sporadic and unpredictable occurrence of these events has led to an analysis of our WinRho \u00ae SDF safety database to identify populations that may be at higher risk for occurrence of AHR's. A disproportionality analysis revealed that malignancies were disproportionally over represented in cases with AHR compared to Non Hemolytic Reactions and was reported in another abstract. Aims: To determine which malignancies were disproportionally overrepresented in patients who developed AHR's. Methods: Medical Histories cases with AHR with malignancies were reviewed and classified by type of malignancy. AHR's included both the expected post infusion hemolysis and infrequently reported cases involving clinically compromising hemolysis including IVH.  Malignancy . Age (years) . <17 . 18-65 . >65 .

Adults above the age of 65 years accounted for 45% of these cases. CLL was present in 66% of patients with leukemia and Non Hodgkins Lymphoma was present in 92% of patients with Lymphomas. Proliferative disorders were diagnosed in 27% of patients with AHR. Solid tumors were present in 14% of patients with AHR's. Conclusions: Hematological malignancies including CLL and NHL are disproportionally over represented in cases presenting with AHR post WinRho \u00ae SDF. Alternate therapies to Rh (D) Immune Globulin should be considered in patients with thrombocytopenia and these hematological malignancies due to increased risk of AHR, such as IVH.
