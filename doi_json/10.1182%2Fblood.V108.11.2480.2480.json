    "abstract_text": "Purpose: Bendamustine is a new anti-lymphoma agent with promising activity. Based on a preceeding phase I study the current trial explored Bendamustine in combination with Mitoxantrone and Rituximab (BMR) in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent lymphomas. Patients and Methods: Patients with relapsed or refractory symptomatic stage III/IV indolent lymphomas with or without prior treatment with Rituximab were eligible. Therapy consisted of Bendamustine 90 mg/m 2 days 1+2, Mitoxantrone 10 mg/m 2 day 1, Rituximab 375 mg/m 2 day 8. Treatment was repeated on day 29 for a total of 4 cycles. Results: Between 04/03 and 07/04 62 patients were recruited from 24 participating institutions, 40% of whom had received prior Rituximab therapy. Median age was 67 years (40\u201383). Lymphoma subtypes were 30 follicular (FL), 18 mantle cell (MCL), 4 B-CLL with plasmacytic differentiation, 3 lymphoplasmacytic (LPL), 3 marginal zone (MZL), 2 diffuse large B-cell (DLBCL), 1 high grade lymphoma not otherwise specified and 1 hairy cell leukemia. The overall response rate (ORR) was 88% with 36% CR and 53% PR. ORR in Rituximab pretreated patients was 75% (38% CR, 38% PR). After a median observation time of 17 months (1 \u2013 33), the estimated median progression free survival is 19 months. Treatment related toxicities of grade 3/4 comprized a reversible myelosuppression (10 % anemia, 78 % leukocytopenia, 46 % granulocytopenia, 16 % thrombocytopenia). However, unexpected hospitalisations were necessary after 10 of 231 cycles (4%) only. Conclusion: BMR is a very effective new outpatient immuno-chemotherapy with low toxicity for patients with relapsed/refractory indolent lymphoma. Response rates  . All patients . FL .
