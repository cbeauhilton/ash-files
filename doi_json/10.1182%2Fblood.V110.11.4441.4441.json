    "abstract_text": "Patients with relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are usually treated with platinum-based salvage chemotherapy. We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy of adding rituximab with ICE as a salvage treatment for relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. From November 2003 to December 2006, patients with relapsed or refractory de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma represented CD20 positivty who received R-ICE (rituximab375mg/m 2 , Ifosfamide 1200mg/m 2 , calboplatin 400mg/m 2 and etopside100mg/m 2 ), were analyzed retrospectively. 23 patients (19 relapse and 4 reflactory) (M:F=14:9) (median age 69, 28\u201377) were included. At starting treatment, twelve patients received rituximab and 11 patients were rituximab naive. In all 23 patients, responses were 11 Complete remission (CR), and 6 partial response (PR), resulting in overall response (ORR) was 74.9%. With median follow up of 10.5 months, estimated 1yr-progression free survival (PFS) was 49% and 1yr-overall survival (OS) was 70%.In patients received rituximab, ORR was 66.7% and 5 patiets achieved CR (41.7%).In the without rituximab, ORR was 90.9% and 7 patiets achieved CR (63.6%). No statistical differences were observed in response even with retuximab pretreatment. Estimated 1yr-PFS was 23% and 70% (p=0.0752) and 1yr-OS was 59% and83% (P=0.0049),respectively. NCI-CTC grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were reported 100% and 91%, For non-hematological adverse event, there were grade 3 liver dysfunction (2/23) and grade 3 arrythmia (1/23). No toxic death was reported in this study. R-ICE showed promising efficacy with tolelable toxicity. Available date suggested adding rituximab to ICE is more effective for patients not received rituximab in the pretreament."
