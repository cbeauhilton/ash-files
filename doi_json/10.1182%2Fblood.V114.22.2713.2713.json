Although the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 subunit is constitutive, HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels are regulated in response to oxygen tension. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1\u03b1 is degraded by the proteasome, and HIF-1 remains inactive. In hypoxia, HIF-1\u03b1 is stabilized and forms a complex with HIF-1\u03b2 that allows HIF-1 to function as a transcription factor. Thus, HIF-1\u03b1 is activated only during hypoxia under normal physiologic conditions. By contrast, HIF-1\u03b1 is frequently activated in cancer cells, including under normoxic conditions by oncogene products or impaired activity of tumor suppressor genes. We previously reported that there is constitutive stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 in many non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cell lines as well as among a significant fraction of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma patients (Evens et al, BJH, 2008), implicating a potential role of dysregulated HIF activation in NHL. Constitutive expression of HIF-1\u03b1 enhances vascularization, increases glucose metabolism, and induces the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins in cancer tissues. HIF-1\u03b1 is thought to be one of the most important molecular targets in the treatment of cancer. PX-478 is a novel small molecule inhibitor of HIF-1\u03b1 being developed for the treatment of cancer. Methods: We treated several DLBCL cell lines (SUDHL4, SUDHL6, and SUDHL10) with increasing concentrations (2\u201325\u03bcM) of PX-478 for 4 hours followed by 20-hour incubation under normoxic (5% oxygen) or hypoxic (1.5% oxygen) conditions. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. Expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 were measured by Western blotting after pre-incubation of cells with 5\u201325\u03bcM PX-478 followed by 20-hour incubation under normoxia or hypoxia. Results: Under hypoxic conditions, dose-dependent downregulation of HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels were noted with complete absence of HIF-1\u03b1 by 20\u03bcM. Interestingly, lower concentrations of PX-478 were needed for effective HIF-1\u03b1 downregulation in normoxia. Of note, there was no change in HIF-2\u03b1 protein levels observed in either normoxic or hypoxic conditions. In cell viability studies, time- and dose-dependent cell death of PX-478 was documented in all cell lines with an associated IC 50 of 15\u201320\u03bcM ( figure below).

Further studies to elucidate the mechanisms of HIF-1\u03b1 dependent cell death in lymphoma and the associated novel therapeutics to target this pathway are warranted.
