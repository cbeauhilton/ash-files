    "abstract_text": "Compared with the traditional chemotherapeutic agents, Bortezomib-based chemotherapy regimens can increase the complete remission and improve the prognosis significantly in the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. Molecular markers which can predict the chemotherapeutic efficacy and safety could help the physicians to make the right decisions and benefit the patients, and it has been one of most interesting research fields in MM. It has been reported that Survivin and Bcl-2 was involved in the adverse clinical events and therapeutic resistance, respectively. In order to investigate the relationship between the Survivin and Bcl-2 expression and the different regimens therapeutic efficacy, we retrospectively studied the proteins expression in the bone marrow biopsy specimens by inmmunohistochemistry and the efficacy of different chemotherapy regimens in the newly diagnosed MM in a single center of Tongji Hospital. Total 59 newly diagnosed MM were admitted into this study. The positive expression rate for Survivin and Bcl-2 was 35.3%\uff08n=21\uff09and 73.5%\uff08n=43\uff09, respectively. The protein expression had no relationship with the Durie-Salmon and International Staging System stratification, which suggested that Survivin and Bcl-2 were not responsible for the clinical manifestations. Bortezomib-based regimens (n=22) could effectively decrease the tumor burden and achieve response (CR+PR: 67.5% ). The non-bortezomib regimens (n=37), containing VAD(T), MP(T), TAD, were effective in the absent of Survivn and Bcl-2 expression(n=7; CR+PR 62.5% ). When Survivin and Bcl-2 were single or double positive (n=30), the newly diagnosed MM patients had no response for non-bortezomib regimens with none reaching complete remission or partial remission (p=0.0088). According to this study, we recommend the newly diagnosed MM which were Survivin and Bcl-2 single or double positive by inmmunohistochemistry received the regimens containing bortezomib for anti-myeloma therapy.
