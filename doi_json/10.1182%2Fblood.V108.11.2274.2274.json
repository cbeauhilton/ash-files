    "abstract_text": "Folate is critical for DNA synthesis and methylation; dysfunction in methylating enzymes may result in genomic instability and DNA damage via the nucleotide synthesis pathways. We hypothesize that perturbation in the folate metabolism pathway may alter the risk of developing childhood leukaemia. We recently reported that methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR 677C>T) was associated with reduced risk in childhood ALL. We aim to explore the value of a pathway approach, in this case exploring the impact of polymorphisms in multiple enzymes involved in the folate pathway, to determine its role in development of childhood ALL. As childhood ALL is highly heterogeneous and that some like TEL-AML1 and hyperdiploid subgroups have in utero origin, we postulated that the impact of folate metabolism may be greatest for in utero onset ALL. We analyzed the methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD1), reduced folate carrier (RFC1) and thymidylate synthase (TSER 5\u2032-UTR 28bp repeat, TSER 3\u2032-UTR 6bp deletion) in 360 children with ALL and 433 controls of Chinese and Malay origin (Ch=221, Mal=212). Genotyping was performed by RFLP-PCR, TEL-AML1 by RT-PCR, and hyperdiploidy either DNA index (\u22651.16) or karyotyping. The latter was only available in some patients, especially in the Chinese. Using logistic regression model analysis, MTHFR 677C>T and MTHFD1 1958G>A showed significant influence on leukemia susceptibility in the Chinese (n=235, p=0.005) and Malays (n=125, p=0.032) respectively. In the Chinese cohort, MTHFR 677 CT and TT genotypes significantly decreased risk of childhood ALL as compared to CC wild type (p=0.004, OR=0.57, 95%CI=0.39\u20130.83), as well as in the hyperdiploidy subgroup (n=35, p=0.002, OR=0.28, 95%CI=0.12\u20130.65). The combined effect of RFC 80GA and AA genotypes with MTHFR 677CC wild type also decreased risk of childhood ALL in Chinese (p=0.05, OR=0.47, 95%CI=0.22\u20131.0). In the Malay cohort, the MTHFR 677 CT and TT genotypes played a protective role only in the TEL-AML1 subgroup (n=27) as compared to CC wild type (p=0.05, OR=0.24, 95%CI=0.06\u20131.0). However, interestingly MTHFD1 1958GG wild type decreased risk of childhood ALL as compared to MTHFD1 1958GA or AA genotypes (p=0.02, OR=0.54, 95%CI=1.11\u20133.05) when combined with MTHFR 677CC genotype. Haplotype analysis of TSER variants showed no significant effect in the 2 races. Using a candidate pathway approach, we showed that polymorphisms in the folate pathway significantly modified the risk of developing childhood ALL especially the MTHFR, MTHFD1 and RFC1. This effect may arise from different genes of the same pathway and this may be different for different races. This supports a pathway way rather than a single-gene approach towards elucidation of cancer risk in childhood ALL.",
