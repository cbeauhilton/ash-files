    "abstract_text": "Clofarabine is a second-generation deoxyadenosine analog with activity in adult AML. To improve single agent activity, various combinations of clofarabine are being studied. In two dose-finding phase I studies, we have previously established the MTD and DLT of the CI and CIA combinations in AML salvage ( Blood  2006 ; 108 : 51a ). Here we report the outcome of a subsequent adaptively (Bayesian) randomized phase 2 study comparing the two anthracycline-containing combinations CI and CIA with CA. Eligible were patients (pts) for first salvage therapy with first relapse or primary refractory AML. Drug doses and schedules were as follows: CI - clofarabine 22.5 mg/m 2 iv d 1\u20135 and idarubicin 10 mg/m 2 iv d 1\u20133; CIA \u2013 clofarabine 22.5 mg/m 2 iv d 1\u20135, idarubicin 6 mg/m 2 iv d 1\u20133, cytarabine 0.75 g/m 2 d 1\u20135; CA - clofarabine 40 mg/m 2 iv d 1\u20135 and cytarabine 1g/m 2 iv d 1\u20135. Up to 2 induction and 4 consolidation cycles were allowed. Eighty-five patients were enrolled of whom 80 are evaluable. Pretreatment characteristics were similar with respect to median age (CI 57 yrs [range 25\u201373], CIA 56 [21\u201381], CA 55 [39\u201373]), proportion of pts with secondary AML (CI 33%, CIA 28%, CA 29%), proportion of pts with primary refractory disease (CI 31%, CIA 50%, CA 41%), prior median CR duration (CI 6 mos [1\u2013108], CIA 6 [1\u201318], CA 10 [2\u201327]), prior exposure to at least intermediate doses of cytarabine (CI 78%, CIA 63%, CA 65%), and proportion of pts with FLT3/ITD abnormalities (CI 25%, CIA 17%, CA 18%). Thirty-three pts received CI, 31 CIA, and 16 CA. Overall, 31 (39%) pts responded (28% CR, 9% CRp). No difference in response was observed according to treatment arm (CI - CR 27%, CRp 12%; CIA - CR 29%, CRp 13%; CA - CR 25%, CRp 6%). Median CR duration was 6.4 mos (0.2\u201318) with CI, and not reached (1\u201312+) with CIA and CA (0.3\u201324) (p=0.07). Overall survival was 5.5 mos (0.3\u201325.5+) for CI, 5.1 mos (0.4\u2013 13.4+) for CIA, and 5.1 mos (0.4\u201327+) for CA (p=0.94). Adverse events were comparable to the preceding phase 1 studies and as have been described with clofarabine in the past. Induction deaths occurred in 6% (CI), 16% (CIA), and 25% (CA), respectively (p>.05), and were due to myelosuppression-associated infectious complications. In summary, the response rate of the clofarabine combinations in AML salvage is 39% (CR+CRp). Response duration and overall survival are not significantly different between the treatment arms.",
