    "abstract_text": "We previously demonstrated that apoptosis-inhibiting proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and XIAP) are important in predicting response to chemotherapy and antibody therapy for CLL. Additionally, genetic abnormalities and epigenetic control of gene expression have become increasingly important in understanding the prognosis and potential therapeutic opportunities in this disease. Greater than 80% of patients with CLL have genetic abnormalities detectable by FISH. Important subsets include those with a less favorable prognosis (deletions of 17p, 11q), an intermediate prognosis (trisomy 12), or a favorable outcome (deletion of 13q). PTPRO , encoding a receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase, is a specific tumor suppressor gene located in chromosomal region 12p12.3. PTPRO has been highly characterized as inhibiting anchorage-independent tumor growth in human lung carcinomas. This gene has been found to be silenced by promoter methylation, and can be re-expressed by hypomethylating agents in human lung tumor models. Thus, we examined the methylation profile of the promoter region of PTPRO in primary leukemic cells from patients with CLL, and in B cells obtained from normal volunteers. Analysis of the PTPRO CpG island by methylation-specific PCR and combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) demonstrated that this region was methylated in 91% of samples from 46 patients, whereas it was unmethylated in control B cells from normal volunteers. Specific quantitative determinations of important proteins related to apoptosis in the leukemic cells from 20 of these patients showed that, in the group with methylation of the PTPRO promoter, there was a significant elevation of Bcl-2 (p=0.079), Mcl-1 (p=0.004), XIAP (p=0.048), Bcl-2/BAX ratio (p=0.0024), and Mcl-1/BAX ratio (p=0.0017). There was no apparent relationship with FISH category or immunoglobulin V H mutational status. Thus, PTPRO promoter methylation analysis may identify a subset of CLL patients less likely to respond to therapy, and provide a potential reversible target for new therapeutic approaches to this disease. Finally, analysis of methylation of CLL samples by restriction landmark genome scanning also revealed methylation of genes for three additional protein tyrosine phosphatases: PTPRN2 , PTPRZ2 , and PTPN11 . Increases in methylation of two of these ( PTPRN 2 and PTPRZ 2) in CLL samples relative to control B cells was confirmed by COBRA. These results provide additional potential molecular targets for CLL therapy."
