    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1414 Poster Board I-437 Introduction: Previous studies demonstrated that the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) was very low among Thais (Lancet. 1975; 1: 1357-8, Arch Intern Med. 1988; 148: 1349-53). However, recent investigations in Asian countries strongly indicated that VTE is currently much more common, approaching rates in the western countries. Meanwhile, the latest National Health Surveys showed the inadequate vegetable and fruit intakes, as well as an obvious rise in prevalence of obesity in Thai population. Therefore, changing diet and behaviors are suspected to contribute to this marked increase in the VTE incidence. Patients and Methods The case-control study was conducted. Cases were objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism. Patients with underlying cancer, antiphospholipid syndrome and arterial thrombosis were excluded. Controls are age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Body mass indices, history of alcohol intake, smoking and exercise were obtained. Food consumptions were interviewed using a food frequency questionnaire modified from the Thailand National Health Examination Survey III previously validated in Thai population. Results: There were 97 cases and 195 controls. The mean age was 54.6 yr, ranging from 17-93 yr, and 70% were female. VTE was significantly associated with low vegetable intakes (below 3.5 standard servings per day) compared with controls (Odd ratio [OR] 2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37-4.67), while there was no difference in fruit consumption (p values =0.53). Notably, low fish intakes (below 0.1 serving per day, OR 3.9, 95%CI 1.58-9.71) and having spicy food less than once a week (OR 1.9, 95%CI 1.15-3.18) also increased the risk. The meat, fat, carbohydrate, fast food or alcohol consumptions were similar. In addition, VTE was associated with overweight (OR 2.1, 95%CI 1.21-3.62) and obesity (OR 3.1, 95%CI 1.46-6.74, p values = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, estrogen uses also increased the risk of VTE (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.05-13.20, p=0.02), while smoking and lack of exercise did not. Conclusions: Low vegetable, fish and spicy food intakes, as well as obesity and hormonal uses, are the risk factors for VTE in Thai population.
