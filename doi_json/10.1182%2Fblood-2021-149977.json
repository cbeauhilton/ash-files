    "abstract_text": "Introduction One important aspect of quality assurance in transplantation relates to the maintenance of central venous access (CVA), especially in outpatient conditions in which patients have a higher degree of activity and manipulation of CVA tends to be more frequent. A comprehensive program oriented to prevent and control complications related to CVA insertion, maintenance and removal is thought to be a highly effective strategy to improve safety outcomes. Methods A retrospective study evaluating complications related to central venous access (CVA) in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was conducted using electronic medical records (EMR) at our center. Laboratory and radiology reports were collected in order to identify complications related to CVA. Patients from May 2015 to July 2021 were included in the study. As per local protocol, insertion of Mahurkar catheter for cell collection is conducted by an experienced surgeon under general anesthesia on day -3 and after a short-stay (6 hours) in hospital patients are discharged. On day -2, cell collection is accomplished following all cautionary measures and removal of catheter is done on day -1. Maintenance and care of CVA is guided by standardized protocols related to cleaning, manipulation, blood sample collection and removal. All patients signed a consent to participate in the study and the study protocol was approved by Cl\u00ednica Ruiz IRB. To be considered as statistically significant, results had to display a two-sided p value <0.05. Results A total of 1088 patients recruited since May 2015 were included in the study. Main indication for auto-HSCT was multiple sclerosis with 1066 (98%), followed by chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy with 16 (1.5%) and 5 (0.5%) patients with other autoimmune disorders. Median age of donors was 46 (40 - 54) years. Median dose of CD34 + cells x10 6 /kg infused per patient was 7.0 (3.7 - 11.3) and the median of collection events per patient was 1 (1 - 2). Cell collection was accomplished via apheresis in (99.5%) of patients, of those CVA was used as collection site in 998 (92%) patients, while a change for peripheral venous access occurred in 85 (8%) patients, due to different reasons, most frequent being any type of CVA obstruction in 62 (83%) of donors. Pneumothorax occurred in 11 (1.1%) patients in whom CVA was used for collection. All cases were successful managed with pleural drainage and hospital admission longer than 24 hours was required for 3 (27%). Furthermore, catheter-related bloodstream infections were identified in 3 (0.3%) patients whom were admitted and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and discharged with no further events. There were no misplacement, thrombotic- nor hemorrhagic-related events in patients with CVA. A multifactorial analysis revealed that relevant factors such as, age, sex and type of disease were not correlated with any type of CVA-related complications. Conclusions We have shown that prevention and control of complications related to CVA at our campuses are highly effective. The proportion of patients experiencing a CVA-related complication was minimal in comparison with other experiences.
