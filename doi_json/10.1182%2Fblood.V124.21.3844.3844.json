    "abstract_text": "Background and Objectives The use of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is increasing in older patients because of reduced ablative regimens and improved supportive care. An old patient usually has a old sibling healthy donors (HDs). The safety of G-CSF for mobilization in elderly HDs has not been provided. In our institution a long-term active follow-up study of G-CSF-mobilized healthy volunteer donors has been implemented. Patients and Methods After a median follow up of 94 months (7.8 years) we reviewed and analyzed safety data of our HDs database according to HDs age: HDs-1 (162), patients younger than 50 years old, HDs-2 (62), patients 50-59 years old and HDs-3 (23), patients 60 or more years old. Long-term follow-up included monitoring of neoplastic, cardiac or autoimmune diseases. Results Two hundred and forty-seven successive donors were evaluated and their characteristics are well balanced among age-groups and no statistical differences have been detected: most of them were male (55.9% ), sibling (97.2%) and HLA matching (93.1%). Mobilization failure rate has been 4.3% (7/162), 1.6% (1/62) and 13% (3/23) in HDs-1, HDs-2 and HDs-3, respectively (p=0.075). Short- and long-term safety was not different among age-groups. Bone pain was reported as the most frequent short-term adverse event (76.5%). Other commonly observed short-term symptoms included headache (31.6%), fatigue (28.7%), insomnia (21.5%), nausea (13.0%) and fever (6.1%). For long-term safety surveillance no haematological malignancies were observed. The observed rate of solid tumors, cardiovascular and autoimmune events, was the expected incidence for these diseases in the western countries. Conclusion In our study, mobilization with lenograstim in elderly HDs seems to be as safe as for young HDs safe. This data contribute to the growing body of evidence of the long-term safety of G-CSF for allogenic donor stem cell mobilization also for elderly HDs.
