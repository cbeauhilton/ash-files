    "abstract_text": "Background. Identification of novel niche factors is critical for understanding of regulatory mechanisms which control HSPC cell fate decisions and design of novel pro-regenerative therapies. We have developed a proximity-based differential single cell analysis approach to the study of the bone marrow niche, which showed that individual osteolineage cells located in close proximity to transplanted HSPC are enriched for expression of niche factors, and have previously reported identification of IL18 and Embigin as regulators of HSPC quiescence. Here we describe the results of in vivo validation of Angiogenin (ANG) - the third molecule highlighted using the above strategy - as a potent regulator of HSPC quiescence and regeneration. Results. ANG is a secreted RNase which is known to promote angiogenesis, proliferation of cancer cells and also enhance cell survival in response to stress. Analysis of primitive cells subsets in the ANG knock-out mice (AngKO mice) revealed a 1.4-fold increase in the frequency and absolute number of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs). Subsequent BrdU incorporation and cell cycle studies demonstrated increased proliferative activity in the primitive HSPC compartment indicating that ANG regulates HSPC quiescence. To confirm these findings functionally and to assess the effect of ANG on self-renewal, we exposed AngKO animals to weekly 5-FU injections and performed serial transplantation experiments of WT LT-HSCs into AngKO hosts. We noted significantly increased mortality of AngKO mice in both experimental settings; in a competitive transplant assay, we observed almost complete absence of engraftment by WT cells in the secondary hosts, in keeping with the exhaustion phenotype. Consistently, exposure of AngKO animals to a different type of hematopoietic stress, such as ageing, resulted in development of peripheral blood cytopenias and marked reduction in the number and frequency of HSPC. ANG is expressed in multiple non-hematopoietic cell types in the bone marrow, including osteoprogenitors, mature osteoblasts and nestin-positive mesenchymal stem cells and NG2-positive arteriolar sheath cells. To establish the predominant cellular source of ANG in the niche, we crossed Ang \"floxed\" mice with the animals in which tamoxifen-inducible Cre -recombinase was driven by the promoters targeting these cell subsets and examined the effect on hematopoiesis. We found that deletion of ANGfrom Osx + , Nes + and NG2 + cells resulted in an increase of the number of LT-HSC and more active cycling of LT-HSC, short-term HSC (ST-HSC) and multi-potent progenitors (MPP) while ANGdeletion in mature osteoblasts had no effect on these cell populations, but was associated with an increase in number and more active cycling of common lymphoid progenitors (CLP), as was also seen upon ANGdeletion from Nes + and NG2 + cells. These results indicate that the target cell population which is regulated by ANG depends on the cellular source. Interestingly, transplantation of WT bone marrow into the animals with Osx-specific ANG deletion resulted in development of macrocytic anemia and neutropenia at 6 months, thus indicating that Angiogenin deficiency in the niche is sufficient for the development of the hematopoietic failure. Impaired long-term reconstitution was also observed when ANG was deleted from Nestin+ mesenchymal stem cells but not col1+ mature osteoblasts in the recipient mice. Our findings that the absence of ANG negatively impacts HSPC self-renewal prompted us to investigate whether exposure of HSPC to recombinant ANG protein will have the opposite effect and enhance hematopoietic regeneration. We therefore treated mouse LT-HSCs with recombinant ANG or vehicle control ex-vivo for 2 hours and competitively transplanted them into lethally irradiated WT recipients. We found that ANG-treated LT-HSCs displayed a significantly higher long-term reconstituting ability, which persisted into the secondary transplants. Similar data were obtained following treatment of CD34+ cord blood cells with human ANG. Conclusion. Our work defines ANG as a previously unrecognized regulator of HSPC quiescence and self-renewal and suggests that it can be explored as a potential therapeutic agent to promote hematopoietic regeneration.
