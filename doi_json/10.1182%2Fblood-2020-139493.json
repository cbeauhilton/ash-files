    "abstract_text": "Even when achieving morphological complete remission (CR) after induction therapy, roughly half of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients display measurable residual disease (MRD) and eventually relapse. The surface receptor FLT3/CD135 is expressed on AML cells in almost all patients and constitutes a highly selective target antigen for immunotherapy, as expression on healthy tissues is limited to low levels on dendritic cells, monocytes and hematopoietic progenitor cells. FLYSYN is a chimeric Fc-optimized IgG1 antibody that binds specifically and with high avidity to human FLT3 (CD135). Here we report updated results of an open-label, single-arm, first in man multicenter trial (recruitment March 2017 to March 2020) evaluating safety/tolerability and preliminary efficacy of FLYSYN in patients with AML (NCT02789254). Morphological CR with stable or increasing MRD in two sequential measurements using central RT-qPCR and/or next generation sequencing (NGS) constituted the main inclusion criterion. FLYSYN was administered i.v. over 3 h as single application in cohorts 1-5 (0.5 mg/m\u00b2, 1.5 mg/m\u00b2, 5 mg/m\u00b2, 15 mg/m\u00b2, 45 mg/m\u00b2); in cohort 6, 15 mg/m\u00b2 were applied on day 1, 15 and 29. Three patients were treated per cohort except for cohorts 4 and 6, which were expanded to comprise 9 and 10 patients, respectively. Molecular response was defined as >1 log MRD reduction or negativity in bone marrow (BM). In total, 31 patients (median age 58 years; range, 21-80 years; male:female ratio: 1:1.8) were enrolled, of which 27, 3 and 1 were MRD-positive for mutated NPM1 , mutated IDH2 and RUNX1-RUNX1T1 , respectively. Based on pharmacokinetic analysis, the half-life of FLYSYN was estimated to be 6.5 days. In 8 patients (26%), a transient decrease of neutrophil count (2 adverse events (AEs) grade 3, others \u2264 grade 2) was observed. No relevant effect on stem cell reserve as assessed by colony forming unit assays was detected in the so far analyzed 26 patients. No other AE > grade 2 or dose-limiting toxicity were observed. The most frequent AEs were unspecific and comprised fatigue and flu like symptoms (12%), musculoskeletal symptoms (8%) and laboratory abnormalities (42%). With regard to efficacy, molecular response to treatment was achieved in 11/31 patients (35%), with so far two patients achieving MRD negativity documented one year after treatment. Among the patients receiving 45 mg/m 2 FLYSYN (in total, upon single or repetitive dosing), objective responses were achieved in 46% (6/13) cases, whereas 28% (5/18) responded to treatment with lower doses. Together, the results of our phase I trial demonstrate that FLYSYN is safe and very well tolerated as monotherapy in AML patients with molecular MRD. Early efficacy data are promising and warrant further evaluation in an up-coming phase II clinical trial.
