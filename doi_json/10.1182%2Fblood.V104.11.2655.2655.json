    "abstract_text": "Asthma is a complex syndrome with well described pathology. However, animal studies and clinical studies in humans continue to provide conflicting data on the contribution of local cells comprising the \u201crespiratory membrane\u201d( airway epithelial, endothelial and smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts etc) vs cells recruited from circulation. Although anti \u03b1 4 monoclonal antibody treatment ameliorates the clinical syndrome, i.v. vs local administration provided disparate results. To get further insight, we induced asthma phenotype in genetic mouse models deficient in \u03b1 4 or \u03b2 2 integrin and compared the results to WT mice. On day 22, 24 hrs post 4 th ovalbumin(OVA) challenge, accumulation of cells in BAL(bronchoalveolar lavage), lung parenchyma(LP) and peripheral blood(PB),airway hyperreactivity (AHR) to methacholine(Mch) and Th2 cytokines were measured.Compared to significant cell accumulation in OVA treated WT, BAL of both \u03b1 4 \u2212/\u2212 and \u03b2 2 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed very few cells (Table). In contrast to BAL, increased number of cells were observed in LP in \u03b2 2 \u2212/\u2212 mice and less so in \u03b1 4 \u2212/\u2212 compared to control.However the increase in \u03b2 2 \u2212/\u2212 LP was 18-fold (post OVA vs untreated) compared to 67-fold in WT and 12-fold in \u03b1 4 \u2212/\u2212.Cells in \u03b2 2 \u2212/\u2212LP represented only 3.8% of total circulating leukocytes vs 19.7% in WT and 1.6% in \u03b1 4 \u2212/\u2212.BAL had increased levels of Th2 cytokines IL-4 (11.3\u00b14.6 pg/ml) and IL-5 (97.8\u00b136 pg/ml,n=5/group) in OVA treated WT, whereas BAL from \u03b1 4 \u2212/\u2212 and \u03b2 2 \u2212/\u2212 mice had undetectable levels of these cytokines. AHR to Mch was measured by whole body plethysmography and expressed as P enh (% of air). In WT at 40 mg/ml Mch AHR increased from 250\u00b127 to 650\u00b170 after OVA treatment while in \u03b1 4 \u2212/\u2212 levels remained similar to untreated (240\u00b125 to 270\u00b120 post OVA challenge) (n=8/group). Additional evaluation by histochemistry showed nearly total abrogation of cell accumulation around blood vessels (H & E stain) and drastic reduction in mucus secretion and airway goblet cell hyperplasia (Alcian blue stain) in k/o vs WT OVA treated mice. Our data suggest that:(1) a direct correlation exists between presence of inflammatory cells and Th2 cytokines in BAL with AHR, (2) moderate accumulation of \u03b1 4 \u2212/\u2212 cells in lung and considerably more of \u03b2 2 \u2212/\u2212 cells in lung post OVA challenge is not accompanied by a concurrent migration to BAL and does not contribute to AHR,(3) intra-tissue migration of cells (lymphocytes,eosinophils and macrophages) from LP to BAL and/or their activation requires presence of either \u03b1 4 or \u03b2 2 integrins and as such provides a novel insight into the mechanism of activation of cells in the respiratory membrane.
