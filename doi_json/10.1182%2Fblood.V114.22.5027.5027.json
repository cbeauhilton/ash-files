    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5027 Background Various factors such as malignant lymphoma cause abdominal lymph node enlargement. A histological diagnosis of malignant lymphoma is important in planning therapy, and although superficial lymph node biopsies are often obtained, target lesions occasionally arise only around the abdominal aorta. These require surgical, or more recently, endoscopic biopsies. To intraoperatively determine whether target lymph nodes are correctly resected during a surgical biopsy can be difficult, and therapy could be delayed due to postoperative complications. Objective To assess the safety and effectiveness of percutaneous biopsy of paraaortic lymph nodes under computed tomography (CT) fluoroscopic guidance. Subjects and Methods We retrospectively investigated puncture success rates based on findings of diagnostic imaging, size of target lymph nodes, rate of confirmed diagnosis, frequency of changes in therapeutic plans and incidence of complications among 36 patients after percutaneous needle biopsy using an 18G cutting needle between September 2002 and March 2009. Results The pre-biopsy diagnoses for the 36 subjects who underwent percutaneous needle biopsy included: malignant lymphoma (n = 26), lymph node metastasis of esophageal cancer (n = 3), lymph node metastasis of lung cancer (n = 3), lymph node metastasis of pancreatic cancer (n = 3) and unknown (n = 3). The median size of the target lymph nodes was 25 mm (range: 9\u2013102 mm). The results of diagnostic imaging indicated that all punctures were successful. The diagnoses were confirmed in 33 of the 36 patients (91.7%). Histopathological findings confirmed malignant lymphoma (n = 21; Follicular Lymphoma in 11 patients, Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma in 8, T-Cell Lymphoma in 1, Hodgkin Disease in 1), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 2), poorly differentiated adenoma (n = 2), other malignancies (n = 5), benign lesions (n = 3) and unknown in 3. Therapeutic strategies were altered based on the results of CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsies in 12 of the 36 patients (33.3%). Three patients developed 4 adverse events comprising grade 1 radiation dermatitis (n = 1), grade 1 hematoma (n = 2) and grade 1 pneumothorax (n = 1). Conclusions Target paraaortic lymph nodes can be accurately punctured using CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy, and the specimens were too small to examine the flowcytometry or chromosome analysis, however it was enough to confirmed the diagnosis according to WHO classification of malignant lymphoma. Percutaneous biopsy of paraaortic lymph nodes under CT fluoroscopic guidance is useful for confirming diagnoses with a low risk of serious deep organ damage.
