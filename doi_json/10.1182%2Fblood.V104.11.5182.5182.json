    "abstract_text": "The Mexican approach was used to conduct nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation (SCT) in patients with various malignant and non-malignant hematologic diseases. Patients received a modified, low-intensity conditioning regimen, which included oral busulphan 4 mg/kg on Days \u22126 and \u22125, IV cyclophosphamide 350 mg/m 2 on Days \u22124, \u22123, and \u22122, IV fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 on Days \u22124, \u22123, and \u22122, oral cyclosporine A 5 mg/kg twice daily staring on Day \u22121 (continuing until Day 180), and IV methotrexate 5 mg/m 2 on Days +1, +3, +5, and +11. Allografts were prospectively performed in 58 patients using sibling donors that were either human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical (6/6) or compatible with 1 mismatch (5/6). In allografts where the donor was an HLA identical sibling (n = 40), the median overall survival was 33 months compared to 8 months when the donor was an HLA compatible sibling (n = 18; P <.01). The 52-month survival was 47% versus 38% in patients receiving allografts from HLA-identical donors and HLA-compatible donors, respectively. The prevalence of acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) was 57% versus 38%, the prevalence of chronic GVHD was 25% versus 11%, and the relapse rate was 45% versus 55% in patients receiving allografts from HLA-identical donors and HLA-compatible donors, respectively. Two patients failed to engraft; both were 5/6 matches. Despite a trend toward less favorable results in patients allografted from HLA compatible (5/6) siblings, most differences in outcome were not significant, likely due to the small number of patients in the study. These data suggest that nonmyeloablative SCT using the Mexican approach may be a valid option for individuals with either an HLA identical or HLA compatible sibling donor.",
