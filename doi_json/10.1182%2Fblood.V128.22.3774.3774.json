    "abstract_text": "The development of anti-FVIII antibodies (i.e., inhibitors) is the major side effect of severe hemophilia A treatment. Inhibitors mainly develop in children during the first 50 exposure days and are classified in low-and high-titer (i.e., peak titer < or > 5 UB/ml). High-titer inhibitors have the major clinical impact. At diagnosis however, the real nature of the antibody is not clear in all patients, since some low-titer inhibitors may progress to high-titer. The determinants of the evolution from low- to high-titer inhibitors are still unclear and the aim of the present study was to investigate potential risk factors associated with the progression from low- to high-titer inhibitors. This study is a follow-up study of the PedNet Registry and includes 260 children with severe hemophilia A and clinically relevant inhibitors, born between 1990 and 2009 and consecutively recruited from 31 hemophilia centers in 16 countries. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from the date of first positive inhibitor test and covered a minimum of 3-years follow-up. Factors potentially associated with progression from low- to high-titer inhibitor development were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. F8 mutation type was known in 247 patients (95%), including 202 (82%) null mutations (i.e., large deletions, nonsense mutations and inversions). Positive family history of inhibitors was present in 37 of 99 (37%) with positive family history of hemophilia. At diagnosis 49% (n=127) had low-titer inhibitors, however, upon FVIII re-exposure, 50% of low-titer inhibitors progressed to high-titer and only 25% of patients (n=69) had persistent low-titer inhibitors. Within the first 3 years of follow-up, immune tolerance induction (ITI) was equally implemented in around 80% of low-and high-titer patients but it was started later in children with high-titers (median time to ITI start 4.5 vs 0.3 months; p<0.001) in whom daily regimens and high-dose FVIII were more frequently adopted (89, 67% vs 41, 50% and 98, 74% vs 35, 43%; p=0.01 and <0.001, respectively). Overall high-titer inhibitor development was associated with null F8 mutations (OR 2.8, 95%CI 1.4-5.5) and family history of inhibitors (OR 3.9, 95%CI 1.2-12.6). The progression from low- to high-titer inhibitors during follow up, was associated with the use of high-dose ITI regimens (i.e., >100 IU/kg/day) with an OR of 3.9 (95%CI 1.5-10.0), independent from the effects of F8 mutation type (adjusted OR 3.6, 95%CI 1.4-9.8) and family history of inhibitors (adjusted OR 6.7, 95%CI 1.1-42.6). No difference was found by comparing the use of daily versus non-daily ITI. In conclusion, in a cohort of 260 children with severe hemophilia A and inhibitors, 49% presented with low-titers at diagnosis and 46% of them progressed to high-titers during follow-up. Progression to high-titer inhibitors was associated with the use of high-dose ITI. These results suggest that intensive ITI should be avoided as initial strategy in low-titer inhibitor patients.
