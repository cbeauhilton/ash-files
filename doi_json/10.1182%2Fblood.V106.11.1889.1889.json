Material and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed blood bank records of all SCD patients transfused pRBCs. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi square test and Fischer\u2019s exact test. Results: During 1990\u20132004, 500 SCD patients received 16,617 pRBCs in our hospital. 387 received pRBCs crossmatched for ABO and Rh only; 121 (31.3%) developed alloantibodies (alloABs).

Once allosensitized, there was an \u2191 chance of subsequent development of multiple alloABs with fewer transfusions.

Technologists required 30 more minutes and $153 extra in reagent costs for extended CEK match. 90% of our donors are Caucasian. Conclusions: Utilizing CEK negative pRBCs \u2193\u2193 alloAB(p<0.01), autoAB (p<0.001) formation and eliminated transfusion reactions in our multiply transfused SCD patients. Universal availability of leukopoor pRBCs (from 1997) may have eliminated febrile reactions. There was \u2193 alloAB formation for C, E, K and other blood group antigens. Though unlikely, Rh neg and CEKneg pRBCs may also be negative for other minor antigens. AutoAB formation (and allergic reactions)especially \u2191 in patients with multiple and simultaneous alloAB formation. CEK matching made it easier to find pRBCs due to less formation of alloABs. However, it resulted in marked overuse of Rh neg pRBCs and extra cost and effort to find CEKneg pRBCs for every transfusion. For cost efficacy, one might consider CEKneg pRBCs after first alloAB."
