    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4793 Introduction: Erythropoietin (EPO) is the major hormone which enhances proliferation and maturation of the red cell lineage, and its recombinant form (rHuEPO) is used extensively to treat various types of anemia. rHuEPO has also been found to exert effects in other organ systems, and our previous work has demonstrated an immunomodulatory role for EPO. Recently, we have also found that mice exposed to high levels of EPO (either rHuEPO injections or transgenic mice overexpressing human EPO), have significantly lower levels of blood glucose than those of their respective controls (Katz et al., J Endocrinol 2010;205:87-95). The current retrospective study was designed to determine whether rHuEPO treatment in hematologic patients, is associated with decreased blood glucose levels. Methods: Patients receiving rHuEPO were examined, comparing glucose levels (morning blood tests, assumed to be fasting) while on rHuEPO treatment to those off treatment. All patients served as their own controls. To test the association between rHuEPO treatment and blood glucose levels, we employed a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: The charts of 19 patients were reviewed to determine the starting date of rHuEPO and the levels of blood glucose in relation to rHuEPO treatment. Mean age: 77 (range: 54\u201393). Thirteen patients had myelodysplastic syndrome, and six had multiple myeloma. Two patients had diabetes mellitus. Average glucose levels (mean\u00b195%CI) without rHuEPO treatment were 116.07\u00b14.98. Glucose measurements were available for a median of 9.23 (interquartile range: 7.90\u201316.80) months after the initiation of rHuEPO treatment. The average glucose level over that period of time was 101.77\u00b14.86 (p<0.0001). The two diabetic patients also demonstrated a trend towards reduced serum blood glucose and lower HbA1C while being treated with rHuEPO. Conclusions: Treatment of hematologic patients with rHuEPO is associated with significantly lower blood glucose levels, and might serve in the future to improve glucose control in anemic patients with hyperglycemia. Further studies with both diabetic and non-diabetic patients are currently underway to clarify this association. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
