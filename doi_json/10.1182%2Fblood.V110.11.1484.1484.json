    "abstract_text": "Renal impairment is a common complication of multiple myeloma (MM). Standard assessment of kidney function in MM includes serum creatinine and creatinine clearance (Ccr) that possibly underestimate the prevalence of renal impairment in this disease. Cystatin-C (Cys-C) is a cysteine-proteinase inhibitor, which participates in the intracellular protein catabolism. It is freely filtered in the glomeruli and totally reabsorbed in the proximal tubular cells; therefore, it is a perfect endogenous marker of glomerular filtration rate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the serum levels of Cys-C in MM and explore possible correlations with clinical data, including survival. We studied 157 newly-diagnosed MM patients (87M/70F, median age 68 years), 28 patients with relapsed disease (17M/11F, median age 68 years) pre- and post-bortezomib therapy, and 15 healthy controls (9M/6F, median age 67 years). Serum Cys-C was determined by particle enhanced immunonephelometry (Dade Behring, Liederbach, Germany). In newly-diagnosed MM patients, serum Cys-C was increased compared with controls [median (range) 1.01 mg/L (0.24\u20135.61 mg/L) vs. 0.7 mg/L (0.59\u20130.95 mg/L); p0.95 mg/L) the median survival was 27 months (95% CI 16.9\u201337.0; pupper normal limit) (n=46) had a median survival of 24 months (95% CI 18.2\u201329.7), while the median survival of all other patients has not been reached yet (p<0.0001). Cys-C could also separate patients with ISS 2 in terms of survival: patients with elevated Cys-C (n=25) had a median survival of 37 months, while the median survival of patients with normal Cys-C levels (n=26) has not been reached yet (p=0.021). Patients with relapsed myeloma had increased median Cys-C (1.36 mg/L) compared with controls (p<0.0001) and newly-diagnosed patients (p<0.01). Bortezomib therapy produced a strong reduction of Cys-C levels (median: 1.07 mg/L, p<0.01). Responders had a greater reduction than non-responders (p<0.01). The results of this study suggest that Cys-C is a sensitive marker of renal impairment and predicts independently for survival in MM. Furthermore, Cys-C seems to be able to separate ISS 2 patients in terms of survival. Bortezomib monotherapy reduces Cys-C levels, mainly in responders.",
