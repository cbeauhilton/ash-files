    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND Novel agents have changed the treatment landscape in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), however little has been reported about real-world treatment sequence patterns and associated outcomes post-introduction of novel agents. Studies have demonstrated that venetoclax is effective for patients (pts) who have discontinued ibrutinib, however treatments and outcomes post-venetoclax discontinuation remain unclear. The objective of this study was to examine real-world treatment sequence patterns post-introduction of novel agents and specifically understand treatment sequencing following venetoclax. METHODS The CLL Collaborative Study of Real-World Evidence (CORE) is a retrospective, multicenter, collaborative observational study of pts with CLL/small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL). For this analysis, adult pts were eligible for inclusion if they started therapy for CLL/SLL in the relapsed/refractory setting after February 12, 2014 (FDA approval date of first novel agent for CLL/SLL). Interim data are presented; data collection for this analysis is ongoing and is expected to be completed by October 31, 2019. Treatment sequences were characterized specifically focusing on treatment sequencing following venetoclax and other novel agents (i.e., BCRi: e.g., ibrutinib, idelalisib or acalabrutinib). Clinical response, as assessed by physician, was also reported from medical charts (iwCLL criteria were provided as a reference only). RESULTS Of the 267 pts available at the time of interim data analysis, 231 pts (87%) received a novel agent in at least one line of therapy (first-line: 35 pts [15%]; second-line: 133 pts [58%]; third-line or later: 63 pts [27%]). Among novel agents, ibrutinib was the most commonly used first novel agent for 198 pts (86%) followed by venetoclax for 18 pts (8%) and idelalisib for 12 pts (5%). Of those 267 pts, 143 pts (54%) received chemotherapy/chemoimmunotherapy (CT/CIT) followed by a novel agent; 63 pts (24%) received a novel agent followed by a novel agent; 17 (7%) received a novel agent followed by CT/CIT; and 47 (18%) received a CT/CIT followed by CT/CIT. At the time of this interim data cut there were 220 pts (82%) who received BCRi-based regimens (first-line: 33 pts [15%]; second-line: 123 pts [56%]; third-line or later: 64 pts [29%]) and 62 pts (23%) who received venetoclax-based regimens (first-line: 2 pts [3%]; second-line: 22 pts [36%]; third-line or later: 38 pts [61%]). Of the 220 pts who received BCRi-based regimens, 50 (23%) achieved complete remission (CR) and 83 (38%) achieved partial remission (PR) (responses based on physician assessment). Of the 220 pts, 88 (40%) went on to receive a subsequent line of therapy. The most common subsequent treatments administered were venetoclax containing regimens (n= 34, 39%). Of the 88 pts who received a subsequent line of therapy after BCRi-based regimens, 22 pts (25%) achieved CR and 24 pts (27%) achieved PR. Of the 62 pts who received venetoclax-based regimens, 20 pts (32%) achieved CR and 14 pts (23%) achieved PR. Of the 62 pts, 15 pts (24%) went on to receive a subsequent line of therapy. The most common subsequent treatment administered were BCRi containing regimens (n= 10, 67%) primarily ibrutinib-based. Of the 15 pts receiving a subsequent line of therapy after venetoclax-based regimens, 3 pts (20%) achieved CR and 4 pts (27%) achieved PR. While preliminary results are encouraging, further data collection efforts are ongoing and will be included for presentation to confirm the results and outcomes associated with different sequencing options. CONCLUSIONS The treatment paradigm is evolving with the introduction of novel agents. Results from this study will provide a baseline description of treatment sequence patterns enabling clinicians to benchmark the impact of the introduction of novel agents and associated outcomes. Early evidence from these results also suggests that novel agents are most commonly introduced during second line treatment and that other novel agents, including ibrutinib, following venetoclax treatment are being utilized in the real-world settings.
