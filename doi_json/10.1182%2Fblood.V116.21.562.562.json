    "abstract_text": "Abstract 562 Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have radically advanced the field of regenerative medicine by making possible the production of patient-specific pluripotent stem cells from adult individuals. By developing iPSCs to treat HIV, there is the potential for generating a continuous supply of therapeutic cells for transplantation into HIV infected patients. In this study, we have utilized human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to generate anti-HIV gene expressing iPSCs for HIV gene therapy. HSCs were de-differentiated into continuously growing iPSC lines with four reprogramming factors and a combination anti-HIV lentiviral vector containing a CCR5 shRNA and a human/rhesus chimeric TRIM5\u03b1 gene. Upon directed differentiation of the anti-HIV iPSCs towards the hematopoietic lineage, a robust quantity (>35%) of colony forming CD133+ HSCs were obtained. These cells were further differentiated into functional end-stage macrophages which displayed a normal phenotypic profile. Upon viral challenge, the anti-HIV iPSC derived macrophages exhibited strong protection (>3 logs) from HIV-1 infection. Here we demonstrate the ability of iPSCs to develop into HIV-1 resistant immune cells and highlight the potential use of iPSCs for HIV gene and cellular therapies.
