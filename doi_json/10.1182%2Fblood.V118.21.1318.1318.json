    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1318 Previous studies have demonstrated that heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the rate limiting enzyme in the catabolism of heme, is a regulator of the balance between hematopoiesis and stem cell preservation under stress. HO-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice display oxidative stress, anemia, and leukocytosis with chronic inflammation. We hypothesize that therapy with inhaled carbon monoxide (CO), a by-product of HO-1 activity with antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties; will reduce stress hematopoiesis in HO-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, reducing inflammation and redistributing hematopoietic potential. In order to test this hypothesis we treated 25 week old HO-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice and HO-1 +/+ mice (n=7/strain) with 250 ppm inhaled CO for 1 h/day, 3 days/week for eight weeks and compared them to an equal number of untreated HO-1 \u2212/\u2212 and HO-1 +/+ mice. After 8-weeks of treatment the mice were sacrificed and flow cytometry was performed on bone marrow to assess hematopoietic potential. Cell cycle analysis of the bone marrow demonstrates that untreated HO-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice have a significantly decreased percent of cells in S-phase compared to untreated HO-1 +/+ mice. Treatment with CO significantly (p<0.05) increases the percent of cells in S-phase in HO-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice but not HO-1 +/+ mice. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in lineage \u2212 , c-kit + , Sca-1 + (KLS) cell population was assessed using 5-(and 6-)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dye. HO-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice have a significantly (p<0.001) increased proportion of ROS positive KLS cells compared with HO-1 +/+ mice. Analysis of long-term (LT), short-term, and multipotent (MPP) progenitor cell populations was conducted. Treatment with CO significantly (p<0.05) increases the percent of LT-HSC and MPP progenitor cells in HO-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice but not HO-1 +/+ mice. Concordantly, the total white blood cell count of the CO-treated mice increased significantly. The differential of the mature blood cells demonstrates significant shift in cell maturation, with significant increase in red blood cells, platelets, and lymphocytes and a significant decrease in monocytes. Combined this data indicates that CO therapy is able to modify the hematopoietic potential of HO-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice leading to a change in mature cell populations. We propose a model in which CO-mediated signaling initiates a homeostatic conditioning program in stem cells to balance hematopoiesis and stem cell preservation, ultimately leading to a change in the inflammatory milieu of the mice.
