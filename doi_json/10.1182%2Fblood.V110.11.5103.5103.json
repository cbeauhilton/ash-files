    "abstract_text": "From May 1998 to November 2006, 77 HD patients who used the regimen of high dose cyclophosphamide HD (CY) 7 or 4g/m 2 , methotretaxe 8g/m 2 and etoposide 2g/m 2 followed by AHSCT were analyzed. Their median age was 25.8 (8.8\u201371.5) years, 46 males and 31 females. At diagnosis 50 (65%) were stage III or IV disease, 10 (13%) had bone marrow involvement, 29 (37.7%) bulky disease and 55 (71.4%) B symptoms. Besides that, all patients were submitted to a mean of 2 (1\u20134) chemotherapy lives and their status were 3 (3.9%) complete remission (CR), 17 (22.1%) partial remission (PR), 57 (74%) progression disease (PD) or in non-specified sensitivity relapse. Concerning CY dose 30 (39%) received 4 g/m 2 and 47 (61%) received 7 g/m 2 . After the HDCY 16 (20.8%) were in CR, 22 (28.6%) PR, 28 (36.3%) remained in DP and 11 (14.3%) died most in PD. After a median follow-up of 3.97 (1.13\u201355.9) months, 53 (68.8%) patients were submitted to AHSCT and their present status is 30 alive [18 CR, 2PR and 10 DP]; 23 dead [2 CR, 14PD and 7 related to the procedure]. Overall survival for transplanted patients was 55% in 8 years. Currently we have 33/77 (43%) alive patients, 19 CR, 3 PR, 11 PD. Overall Survival (OS) for whole group was 32%, Disease Free Survival (DFS) 64% and Progression Free Survival (PFS) 40%. Patients who were in DP or relapse prior to the HDCY (57) compared to their status after that had a significant improvement ( P =0,001), their OS was 40% to CR-PR group (24) versus 16% PD group (33). In general, mortality was 44 (57%), their cause was 19 PD (43.2%), 8 (18.2%) related to HDCY, 2 (4.5%) related to HDMTX, 7 (16%) related to AHSCT, 6 (13.6%) infections, 1 (2.3%) chronic GVHD after a reduced intensity conditioning regimen transplant and 1 (2.2%) AML. Besides that, 3 patients developed MDS and 1 developed AML. In conclusion, although it had happened a significant number of toxicity related deaths, the sequence is feasible, mainly for sensitive patients and presents an acceptable response. The authors emphasize the high frequency of poor prognosis patients and occurrence of MDS/AML in 4 (5.2%) patients."
