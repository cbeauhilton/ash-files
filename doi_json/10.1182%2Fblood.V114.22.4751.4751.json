    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4751 Background Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is one of an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illness and is the second common cerebral mass lesion after toxoplasmosis in HIV infected population. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) significantly improved the survival of AIDS related PCNSL. But, the standard procedure to manage these patients still remains to be established. We performed the nationwide retrospective survey to elucidate the actual status and the significant prognostic variables of AIDS-related PCNSL in the HAART era. Methods All AIDS related PCNSL newly diagnosed at 12 regional center hospitals for HIV/AIDS in Japan during the period 2002-2008 were registered. The data about diagnostic modalities, CD4 counts, performance status (PS), HAART regimens, treatment modalities, and clinical outcomes were collected. A multivariate and univariate Cox regression analysis was performed to assess the effects of treatment and the clinical variables on OS. Results Twenty four AIDS related PCNSLs were registered. Median age was 41 (21-60) year old, and male gender was 96%. Ten patients were diagnosed as PCNSL based on imaging features and positive EBV DNA PCR of cerebrospinal fluid without brain biopsy. HAART was administrated in 88%. Twenty two patients were treated by radiotherapy alone, and only one cases were received the combined modality treatment. Multivariate analysis revealed that the significant predictor of improved survival was completion of whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with a total dosage more than 30 Gy (P=0.017). Furthermore, 9 of 10 patients with good PS (0-2) group were alive with CR (all were received WBRT), nevertheless 64% of poor PS (3 or 4) group (9/14) died sometimes with short clinical course. The estimated 3yrs overall survival rate of each group was 100% and 38% respectively (p=0.0198). The incidence and grade of radiation related leukoencephalopathy was limited in good PS group. Conclusion Radiotherapy alone with HAART is shown to be the most common treatment for the AIDS-related PCNSLs, but the role of systemic chemotherapy should be elucidated. Some AIDS-related PCNSLs, especially with good PS, achieved the durable remission by WBRT with the curative intent dose, in the HAART era. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
