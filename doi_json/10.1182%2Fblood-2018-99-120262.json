    "abstract_text": "Genome editing of Hematopoietic stem Cells has revolutionized the treatment strategies for genetic disorders. Despite this, it still remains a great challenge as hematopoietic stem cells tend to lose its stem-ness during the ex vivo culture and gene editing process. The need for large dose of CD34 + HSPCs for manipulation makes it a seemingly difficult strategy. Recent works suggest that the potential effects of small molecules in expanding cord blood HSPCs ex vivo promoting self-renewal and delaying differentiation. We screened several reported small molecules to identify a condition that promotes the expansion of adult HSPCs for gene manipulation process. The mobilized Peripheral blood HSPCs are purified and cultured with a cytokine cocktail. Along with the cytokine cocktail, we tested several small molecules and in different combinations. Expression of cell surface receptors were analysed by FACS after 12 days of ex vivo culture. Our screening identified a unique culture condition that expanded the primitive stem cell population (CD34 + /CD133 + /CD90 + cells) along with the early progenitors (CD34 + /CD133 + ) and the progenitors (CD34 + ). Our culture conditions expanded the primitive cells by 20 folds compared to the mock treated cells. Our treatment release experiments suggested that the expansion is due to our culture conditions and are reversible.The colony forming cell (CFC) assay showed about 30 fold increase in the numbers of multilineage colony forming cell (CFU-GEMM) thereby ensuring the proliferation and differentiation capacity of expanded HSPCs. Their differentiation ability was also confirmed by ex vivo differentiation into Megakaryocytes. Our treatment conditions reduced the apoptosis rate during the ex vivo culture and improved their cell migration response towards SDF. The reduced reactive oxygen species levels and increased CXCR4 expression were observed in our expanded HSPCs and these might be the possible reasons for the low apoptosis and better cell migration respectively.
