    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Transcutaneous immunization (TCI) is a novel vaccination strategy to induce strong therapeutic cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses by directly targeting skin-resident professional antigen-presenting cells (APC). This vaccination approach is very promising to overcome current limitations of standard vaccination approaches that are mostly effective in prophylaxis, but not in the treatment of diseases. In this context, we have developed a TCI method based on a synthetic TLR7 agonist imiquimod that partial tumor protection in experimental rodent models. In our present work, we describe a novel optimized formulation of imiquimod in a solid suspension of crystalline imiquimod (IMI-Sol) that induces superior CTL responses and enhanced tumor protection. Methods: We determined imiquimod-penetration into the skin as well as systemic distribution by HPLC in C57BL/6 mice (at 6-12 weeks). For TCI, C57BL/6, Tlr7 (TLR7 -/- ) or Myd88 (MyD88 -/- ) gene deficient mice IMI-sol or imiquimod (in the commercially available formulation Aldara\u00ae) together with the CTL epitope SIINFEKL (derived from chicken ovalbumin) was applied on two consecutive days on the dorsum of the animals after hair removal by electric clippers. Induction of CTL responses was characterized after 7 days by the analysis of peptide-specific CTLs (ELISpot, tetrameric MHC I complexes) and in vivo cytolytic activity by flow cytometry. Tumor protection was assessed using the B16OVA tumor model. Results: Despite equal imiquimod penetration into the skin, we found superior vaccination capacity of IMI-Sol compared to Aldara \u00ae leading to enhanced tumor-protection. Using TLR7 -/- or MyD88 -/- mice, we confirmed that the induction of CTL responses with IMI-Sol was completely dependent on the TLR/MyD88 pathway. The enhanced immune response are due to more efficiently activated skin-derived DCs upon IMI-Sol treatment found in skin-draining lymph nodes. Conclusions: We developed of a superior imiquimod formulation for transcutaneous vaccination that boosts vaccination efficacy by the enhanced activation of skin-resident APCs leading to the induction of therapeutic CTL responses underscoring the importance of pharmaceutical aspects affecting vaccination potency beyond understanding of the underlying basic mechanisms. Combined efforts are necessary to establish TCI as a promising novel next generation vaccination platform that can be used for the treatment of persistent infections and cancer.
