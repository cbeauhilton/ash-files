    "abstract_text": "Binding of macromolecular ligands like fibrinogen to the active conformation of the integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 mediates platelet aggregation. Because platelets circulate in a fibrinogen-rich milieu, the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 on circulating platelets is constrained in an inactive conformation by intramolecular interactions involving the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and stalk domains of \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 to prevent the spontaneous formation of platelet aggregates. Following platelet stimulation, \u03b1IIb\u03b23 undergoes a global rearrangement during which the \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and stalk domains separate and the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 headpiece opens to expose its ligand binding site. Protein-protein interfaces, such as those of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 stalks, are usually large complementary surfaces in which specific side chains, representing energetic \"hot spots\", contribute disproportionately to the binding free energy. Previously, we reported the use of a computational method, comprehensive interface design, as a way to control the direction of protein interactions by introducing changes in protein structure that destabilize undesired interactions. This enabled us to identify energetic hot spots in the \u03b23 stalk, mutation of which caused constitutive \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation. Here, we have extended our design strategy to the \u03b1IIb stalk. We used the Rosetta alanine scanning algorithm and the available crystal structure of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 heterodimer to identify alanine substitutions in the \u03b1IIb region extending from residues 602-959 that would be predicted to destabilize the resting \u03b1IIb\u03b23 stalk interface. The functional consequences of the predicted mutations were confirmed by introducing them into wild type \u03b1IIb, expressing the mutant \u03b1IIb together with wild type \u03b23 in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and measuring fibrinogen binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in the absence and presence of dithiothreitol by flow cytometry. We identified 5 alanine substitutions predicted to destabilize the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 stalk interface by >1.0 kcal/mol, 5 alanine substitutions predicted to destabilize the interface by 0.3-1.0 kcal/mol, and 2 neutral alanine substitutions having no effect on the interface as negative controls. Four of the 5 substitutions predicted to be the most destabilizing were located in the \u03b1IIb calf-2, rather than the calf-1, domain, and involved residues R751, N753, F755, and E785. It is noteworthy in this regard that the 5 destabilizing \u03b23 substitutions we previously reported were located in the distal \u03b23 stalk. To confirm the predictions of the computational alanine scanning, we introduced the four most destabilizing calf-2 substitutions and the two neutral controls into \u03b1IIb and co-expressed them with wild type \u03b23 in CHO cells. There was little to no expression of \u03b1IIb R751A \u03b23, implying that the presence of R751 is important for correct \u03b1IIb folding and/or \u03b1IIb\u03b23 assembly. By contrast, each of the other predicted destabilizing substitutions expressed and caused constitutive \u03b1IIb\u03b23 ligand binding activity. Moreover, as predicted, \u03b1IIb\u03b23 containing each of the neutral \u03b1IIb substitutions was inactive until the CHO cells were incubated with dithiothreitol. Thus, these results confirm the utility of our computational approach for identifying functionally significant regions in \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Further, they demonstrate that the interface between the distal \u03b1IIb stalk and the distal \u03b23 stalk, much like the interface between the \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 transmembrane domains, plays an important role in regulating the equilibrium between the inactive and active states of \u03b1IIb\u03b23.
