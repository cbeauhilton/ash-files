    "abstract_text": "Background: Previous studies in a mouse model with \u201cchilled\u201d mouse platelets stored at 4\u00b0C for two hours with and without galactosylation showed protection against the adverse effects of chilling with galactosylation ( Science  2003 ; 301 : 1531 ). However, prior studies with human platelets demonstrated that the adverse effects of 4\u00b0C storage became irreversible only after 18 to 24 hours of 4\u00b0C storage ( J Lab Med  1978 ; 6 : 971 ). Therefore, we performed viability studies using human platelets stored for two days to exceed the period of potential reversibility of any cold-induced platelet injury. Methods: Apheresis platelets were collected using Haemonetics MCS+ equipment from four normal volunteers. After collection, the platelets were pooled into one bag, and then the platelets were divided equally between two storage bags. Half of the platelets from each of the four collections were stored at 4\u00b0C with galactosylation, and the other half of the platelets were stored at 4\u00b0C without galactosylation (two collections) or at 22\u00b0C using standard storage conditions (two collections). After storage, samples from each of the two types of platelets stored from a volunteer were radiolabeled with either 51 Cr or 111 In, re-injected, and serial blood samples were drawn to determine post-transfusion recoveries and survivals of the radiolabeled autologous platelets. Results: Results of the radiolabeled platelet studies are shown in the table.

Conclusions: The data show that, following two days of 4\u00b0C storage, the recoveries and survivals of the galactosylated platelets are no different than the non-galactosylated 4\u00b0C stored platelets from the same volunteer. Although the recoveries of the 4\u00b0C stored platelets with and without galactosylation are well-maintained compared to the 22\u00b0C stored platelets, the survivals are markedly reduced as has been previously shown for 4\u00b0C stored platelets ( Br J Haematol  1976 ; 34 : 403 ).",
