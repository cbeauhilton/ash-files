    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3313 Poster Board III-201 RIC allo-SCT has been increasingly used as treatment for AML patients (pts) ineligible for myeloablative allo-SCT. Previous studies have observed a lower risk of relapse in pts who experienced chronic GVHD after RIC allo-SCT versus in those who did not. The objective of the current study was to further investigate the association between chronic GVHD and relapse in a large cohort of pts given RIC allo-SCT as treatment for AML. Data from 1188 AML pts in first or second CR transplanted between 2000 and 2008 following a RIC regimen at EBMT affiliated centers were analyzed. Patients were given PBSC from HLA-identical sibling (MRD, n=879), or from HLA-matched unrelated donors (MUD, n=309). RIC was defined as Busulfan conditioning regimens containing \u2264 8mg/kg total dose, or TBI  55 yrs (P=.008), alemtuzumab use in the RIC (P=.048), TBI-based RIC (P=.006), high-risk cytogenetics (P=.001), and absence of chronic GVHD (P=.015) were each associated with higher risk of relapse. Factors associated with high NRM were MUD versus MRD (P=.003), grade II-IV acute GVHD (P 55 yrs (P=.007), alemtuzumab use in the RIC (P=.012), and high-risk cytogenetics (P=.003). In conclusion, in this cohort of AML patients transplanted in remission, chronic GVHD was associated with a lower risk of relapse while profound in-vivo T cell depletion with alemtuzumab was associated with higher relapse rate suggesting that GVL effects play a role in preventing AML relapse in patients given RIC allo-SCT. Therefore, closed surveillance of patients in this setting not presenting chronic GVHD such as decreasing of immunosuppression should be further investigated.
