    "abstract_text": "X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the interleukin-2 receptor \u03b3 chain ( IL2RG ), and is characterized by lack of response to common \u03b3-chain-dependent cytokines and profound defects in T-, B- and NK-cell functions. Previous gene therapy clinical trials based on autologous transplantation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) genetically corrected with MLV-derived retroviral vectors expressing IL2RG in non-conditioned patients showed long-lasting restoration of T-cell immunity in most cases but resulted in vector-induced leukemia through enhancer-mediated insertional mutagenesis in 25% of patients. The use of an enhancer-less MLV vector to deliver the IL2RG gene caused no adverse events while retaining a significant clinical benefit. To increase the efficacy of gene therapy and reduce at the same time the probability of genotoxic insertional events, we developed a third-generation lentiviral vector carrying a codon-optimized human IL2RG cDNA under the control of the human EF1\u03b1-S promoter. The vector was VSV-G-pseudotyped and produced by transient transfection of 293T cells, followed by ion-exchange chromatography, tangential-flow filtration and formulation in HSC growth medium. Replacement of the native IL2RG open reading frame by a codon-optimized sequence resulted in a 3-fold increase in mRNA expression and a 1.5-fold increase in IL2RG protein expression per integrated vector copy. The performance of the vector was demonstrated in vitro by the restoration of a normal level of IL2RG mRNA or protein in a human IL2RG-deficient T-cell line at a VCN of 1 to 3, and by high efficiency (>80%) transduction of human mobilized CD34 + HSPCs and transgene expression with no impact on viability or clonogenic capacity. An in vitro immortalization assay (IVIM) showed a safe genotoxic profile, while the in vivo safety and efficacy of the vector was tested it in a preclinical model of SCID-X1 gene therapy based on transplantation of genetically corrected Lin - cells from IL2rg -/- donor mice into lethally-irradiated IL2rg -/- - Rag2 -/- recipients. The study showed biodistribution of the transgene in hematopoietic organs only, restoration of T, B and NK cell counts in bone marrow and peripheral blood, normalization of lymphoid organs (thymus and spleen) and a low frequency of hematopoietic malignancies, comparable to that of untreated animals, six months after transplantation. An extensive insertion site analysis was carried out in bone marrow, thymus and peripheral blood of individual or groups of animals to detect the presence of any clonal abnormality or skewing, and any deviation from a normal lentiviral integration pattern. The study showed the expected genomic integration profile and no signs of clonal dominance of transduced cells. Interestingly, analysis of >100,000 integration sites in pre- and post-transplant murine cells showed that lentiviral vectors target at high frequency a substantially different set of genes compared to human CD34 + cells, uncovering the need for appropriate controls and at the same time the limits in the predictive power of mouse-based genotoxicity studies, particularly those addressing proto-oncogene activation and clonal dominance. These studies will enable a multicenter phase-I/II clinical trial aimed at establishing the safety and clinical efficacy of lentiviral vector-mediated gene therapy for SCID-X1. The clinical protocol is based on transplantation of autologous CD34 + HSPCs transduced with the EF1a-IL2RGco lentiviral vector in infants after non-myeloablative conditioning, and aims at stable and sustained restoration of both T- and B-cell immunity.
