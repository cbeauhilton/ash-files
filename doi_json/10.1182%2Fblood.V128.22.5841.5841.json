    "abstract_text": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of miR-155 in Chinese acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The miR-155 levels of 142 de novo AML patients and 28 healthy donors were detected by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR). The miR-155 expression was significantly up-regulated in AML compared with control (p0.05). Collectively, Increased miR-155 expression is associated with FLT3-ITD mutation and poor therapy response in Chinese AML and allo-HSCT could improve survival of these patients.
