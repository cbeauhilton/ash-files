    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Chemoimmunotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been the standard of care for initial treatment. A randomized demonstrated both a progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) advantage when rituximab was added to fludarabine (F) and cyclophosphamide (C). Alemtuzumab (Campath) (CAM), an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, is an effective therapy for patients with both previously untreated and relapsed CLL. Its role in combination with chemotherapy is less certain. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter phase II clinical trial of FC followed by subcutaneous CAM in previously untreated CLL. Patients were eligible if they met standard criteria for initiating therapy, or if they were asymptomatic with the prognostically adverse immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) gene unmutated status. Patients received fludarabine (25 mg/m2/day, days 1-3) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m2/day, days 1-3) every 28 days for six treatment cycles, followed by a 3-8 week rest period. Disease response was assessed, including minimal residual disease (MRD) status by sensitive flow cytometry in those in complete remission (CR). Patients who achieved less than a CR were eligible to receive standard dose CAM (30 mg thrice weekly for 12 weeks); those who were in CR but MRD positive could receive reduced dose CAM (30 mg weekly for 12 weeks). The primary outcome was duration of response (DOR). Secondary outcomes included the response rates after FC and after the addition of CAM, as well as the safety profile of the regimen. RESULTS: We enrolled 25 patients from November 2004 to June 2007 at 3 centers. The median age of the participants was 62 years (range 42-75). Detailed information was available for 17 patients pre-treatment: high risk Rai stage in 9, IGHV unmutated in 9 including 4 patients who were IGHV unmutated as their indication for treatment. Five patients had trisomy 12, 4 had 13q deletion, 1 each had 17p deletion and 11q deletion, and 6 had no abnormality. One patient was excluded from the analysis due to a diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma after eligibility review. Four patients had no response evaluation and were considered treatment failures. Seventeen (71%) patients had a CR after 6 cycles of FC, including 11 who were MRD negative, one had a partial response (PR), and two had progressive disease (PD). Four of the 6 patients who were MRD positive received CAM after FC. Two required only a single dose to become MRD negative, and 2 received 12 weekly doses. One of these patients became MRD negative. The median DOR for those achieving CR was 38 months (range 12-105 months). There were no treatment related deaths. Five patients experienced a SAE including one with febrile neutropenia, two with pneumonia, and two with autoimmune hemolytic anemia. There were ten additional treatment emergent adverse events including two that were grade 3 (mucositis and fever) and one CMV reactivation while receiving CAM. Two patients developed treatment related myelodysplasia, one died and the other underwent allogeneic stem cell transplant. There were two deaths due to Richter\u2019s transformation. During long term follow up, there have been five additional deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The CR rate after FC was higher than that reported in prior trials of previously untreated patients and the incidence of MRD negative CR was surprisingly high. The DOR was consistent with prior experience with FC. Too few patients received CAM to draw any conclusions about its role as a consolidative therapy given subcutaneously on a weekly schedule. Both the FC and CAM therapies were well tolerated, with few adverse events associated with their use. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
