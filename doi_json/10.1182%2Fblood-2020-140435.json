    "abstract_text": "Von Willebrand disease (vWD) is the most common inherited congenital bleeding disorder. Type 1 is a deficiency, but not absence, of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and is the most common type. Bleeding episodes in patients with type 1 vWD vary and are related to the relative amount of von Willebrand factor produced. We report a case of a 15-year-old male with mild von Willebrand disease type 1 (vWF: 35%) who presented with a right eye grade lll hyphema and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) following a traumatic injury. Despite medical management with Diamox, ophthalmic steroids, vWF replacement with Humate-P, the patient had a repeat bleeding event and worsening of his elevated intraocular pressure. Due to concern for corneal blood staining, the patient required surgical intervention with an anterior chamber washout. Von Willebrand factor replacement was given on presentation and prior to the procedure with goal von Willebrand factor (vWF) activity and Factor Vlll (FVlll) levels of 80-100 IU/dL. Factor replacement for a traumatic hyphema is necessary to reduce bleeding, but could lead to increased risk of thrombosis formation and increase risk of corneal staining. Balance between bleeding and thrombosis can lead to treatment challenges in patients with bleeding disorders including vWD.
