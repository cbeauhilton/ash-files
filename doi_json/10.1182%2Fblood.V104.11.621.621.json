    "abstract_text": "We conducted an IPDMA using data from 9 randomized trials comparing allogeneic PBSC transplants to bone marrow (BM), focusing specifically on the issue of the administration of 3 vs. 4 doses (day 11) of MTX as part of a regimen for GVHD prophylaxis which included cyclosporine. The administration of day 11 MTX was trial specific and data were analysed by intention to treat, irrespective of whether the 4 th dose of MTX was actually given. Six trials containing 573 patients prescribed 4 doses of MTX while 3 trials containing 508 patients prescribed 3 doses of MTX. Four doses of MTX conferred a statistically significant survival advantage, death odds ratio (OR) 0.67 (CI 0.52\u20130.88) (p=0.0036) for recipients of PBSC compared to BM, while with 3 doses, there was no statistically significant difference. The difference between the two subgroups was significant (test of interaction chi 2 =7.9;p=0.005). Disease-free survival was also significantly better among recipients of PBSC in the 4 dose studies OR 0.62 (CI 0.48\u20130.80) while no difference was seen in the 3 dose studies. Test of interaction between the two subgroups was significant, chi 2 =9.7;p=0.002. The effect on survival and DFS appeared to be due primarily to the rates of relapse. In the 4-dose studies relapse rates were 36.6% at 6 years among recipients of BM compared to 19.2% among recipients of PBSC (p=0.0015). The rates of relapse in the 3 dose studies were 26% for both recipients of PBSC and BM. Test of interaction between the two subgroups was again significant (chi 2 =4.3; p=0.04). Thus the administration of 4 doses of MTX had a negative impact among recipients of BM which resulted in higher relapse rates. The effect on relapse-related mortality was also significant, 23.6% BM v. 14.2 % PBSC (p=0.018) in the 4 dose studies but not significant in 3 dose subgroup (14 vs. 23%, p=0.42). Test of interaction between the two subgroups was not significant (chi 2 =0.7;p=0.4). The effect was not due to non-relapse mortality which was not statistically different among patients in the 4-dose MTX studies and the 3 dose MTX studies. The rates of acute GVHD grades 2\u20134 were the same among recipients of PBSC or BM in both the 4 dose and 3 dose studies. Chronic extensive GVHD was higher among recipients of PBSC irrespective of whether patients received 3 or 4 doses of MTX; at 5 years 57.3% PBSC v. 47.3% BM, (p=0.0037) for 4 dose, 49.2% PBSC v. 26.1% BM, (p=0.00004). Both platelet and neutrophil engraftment was faster in PBSC arm (p<0.0001), but interestingly the test of interaction between two subgroups was significant only for platelet engraftment (chi 2 =11.4;p=0.0007) and not for neutrophil engraftment (chi 2 =0.6;p=0.4). We conclude that 4 doses of MTX given as part of a GVHD prophylaxis regimen was beneficial for the most important patient outcomes (survival, DFS and relapse) for patients receiving allogeneic PBSC but detrimental to recipients of BM. We hypothesize that the 4 th dose of MTX provided extra immunosuppression among BM recipients resulting in a reduced anti-leukemic effect. This theory should be tested in a prospective randomized study. View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure "
