    "abstract_text": "Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated the role of the G-CRE (G\u03b3-globin cAMP response element) in drug-mediated fetal hemoglobin induction. The G-CRE located at \u22121222 to \u22121229 in the promoter of G\u03b3-globin gene, contains binding site for trans-factors CREB1, ATF-2 and cJun. We previously demonstrated binding of phosphorylated CREB1 and ATF-2 to this element via p38 MAPK signaling triggered by sodium butyrate (NaB) and trichostatin A (TSA). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with a probe containing the AC \u2192 TG mutation in the G-CRE (TGTGGTCA, m2) abolished trans-factor binding to the G-CRE. Furthermore, G\u03b3 promoter activity was abolished in the PGL3 luciferase reporter vector driven by the G\u03b3 promoter (\u22121500 to +36) carrying the m2 mutation. ( Sangerman et al. Blood  108 : 3590 \u20139, 2006 ). Subsequent studies in our laboratory were aimed at understanding the role of trans-factor cJun, an AP-1 family member, as a regulator of G\u03b3-globin expression via the G-CRE site. In K562 cells treated with 2mM NaB or 0.3\u03bcM TSA for 48 hrs, cJun phosphorylation increased 2.8-fold and 6.4-fold respectively by western blot analysis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed 16-fold chromatin enrichment in the \u22121225 G\u03b3-globin region compared to IgG control studies indicative of significant cJun binding in vivo at steady state. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using cJun monoclonal antibody demonstrated a supershifted DNA-protein complex confirming binding of cJun to the G-CRE probe. To gain evidence for a functional role of cJun, we performed enforced expression studies using the pLen-cJun vector. In a concentration dependent manner, over-expression of cJun increased luciferase activity up to 350-fold in the luciferase reporter plasmid controlled by the G\u03b3-promoter (\u22121500 to +36). As predicted from binding studies, the m2 mutation in this promoter abolished the cJunmediated trans-activation confirming that the G-CRE is required to mediate effects of cJun. We are currently investigating the ability of cJun to trans-activate the endogenous G\u03b3-globin gene in K562 cells. To achieve this goal, K562 stable lines were established with the expression vectors pLen-cJun and empty vector. A complete analysis of the stable lines is in progress. Future investigations to identify other components of the functional CREB1/ATF2/cJun enhanceosome complex bound to the G-CRE will be performed using affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry. This information will be used to develop strategies for fetal hemoglobin induction.",
