    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION : High-dose salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is the standard of care for refractory/relapsed (R/R) Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Achieving complete remission (CR) prior to ASCT represents the strongest prognostic factor for R/R HL patients receiving salvage chemotherapy. Therefore, increasing the CR rate prior to ASCT represents a primary goal in these patients. Since Bendamustine monotherapy induces CR in a substantial proportion (25% to 35%) of R/R HL patients, the present phase II study aimed at investigating efficacy and toxicity of a novel salvage regimen combining Bendamustine, Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine (BeGEV) as second-line salvage chemotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory HL. PATIENTS AND METHODS : HL patients who were refractory to, or have relapsed after one previous chemotherapy line were eligible. The primary endpoint was CR rate after four cycles of therapy. Secondary endpoints were: overall response rate (ORR), stem cell mobilization activity, and toxicity. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were also evaluated. BeGEV regimen consisted of: Bendamustine (90 mg/sqm, days 2-3), Gemcitabine (800 mg/sqm, day 1 and 4) and Vinorelbine (25 mg/sqm, day 1) every 3 weeks for a total of 4 courses. RESULTS : Between August 2011 and March 2014, 59 consecutive patients with relapsed (46%) or refractory (54%) HL were enrolled. The median age was 33 years (range 18-68). Out of 59 enrolled patients, 43 (73%) achieved a CR and 6 (10%) a partial response (PR) for an ORR of 83%. One case (2%) showed stable disease (SD), while 8 patients (14%) progressed, and 1 (2%) was not evaluable for response. With a median follow-up of 16 months, the 2-year PFS and OS were 51% and 69%, respectively, without significant difference between relapsed and refractory patients. OS was higher for BeGEV-responding (CR+PR) patients compared with those who failed the induction regimen (2-year OS: 86% vs 0%, p<0.001). Fifty-seven out of 59 patients were evaluable for CD34+ cell mobilization. Mobilization failure was detected in 2 of 57 patients (3.5 %) while CD34+ cells were successfully harvested in 55 out of 57 evaluable patients (96.5 %). Forty-two patients (76%) required 1 leukapheresis to harvest the planned target CD34+ cell yield (3\u00d710 6 CD34+ cells/Kg body weight) while 13 patients (24%) required 2 leukaphereses. The median total yield of CD34+ cells/Kg body weight was 8.8\u00d710 6 CD34+ cells (range, 3-56). After ASCT, engraftment of neutrophils and platelets was recorded on day 11 (range 9-21) and day 12 (range 9 - 26), respectively. Among the 49 responding patients, 43 (88%) proceeded to ASCT (38/43 in CR, 5/6 in PR); the remaining 6 patients did not proceed to ASCT due to mobilization failure (n=2), physician's decision (n=2), early relapse (n=1), and patient's refusal (n=1). Hematological and non-hematological side effects were acceptable. Out of 204 administered cycles, 23 (11%) had to be delayed and 4 (2%) reduced, respectively; only 1 patient stopped therapy for toxicity. The most common grade 3-4 nonhematologic toxicities included febrile neutropenia (n=7), and infections (n=4). Among hematologic toxicities, grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were experienced by 8 (13.5%) patients. CONCLUSIONS : This phase II study demonstrates that BeGEV is a highly effective salvage regimen able to induce a remarkable proportion of complete remission prior to ASCT in relapsed/refractory HL patients. These data provide a strong rationale for further development of the BeGEV regimen.
