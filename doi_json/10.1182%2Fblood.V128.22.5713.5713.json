    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Bendamustine is a bifunctional alkylating agent, with low toxicity, proved to be effective in relapsed, refractory and in new diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (MM). It has been evaluated efficacy and tolerance of Bendamustine, in combination with bortezomib-dexamethasone (BVD) in patients with relapsed and refractory MM (rrMM), whose prognosis is particularly severe. A regional retrospective real-life analysis of patients with rrMM who had been treated with BVD as salvage therapy has been performed. Methods : 56 patients (31 M/25 F), with rrMM, median age at diagnosis 57.3 years (r. 36-82), median age at start of treatment 61.8 years (r.37-83) treated with several lines of treatments (median 6, r. 2-11), every refractory to all the drugs previously received (also Bortezomib), received BVD (Bendamustine 90 mg/sqm days 1,2; Bortezomib 1.3 mg/sqm days 1,4,8,11, Dexamethasone 20 mg days 1,2,4,5,8,9,11,12, Pegfilgrastim day +4) every 28 days, until progression. ISS was equally distributed, and cytogenetic was evaluable in 12 patients, and in particular one del13q and one t(11;14). All the patients had previously been treated with schedule containing bortezomib and IMIDs, and 30% had also received radiotherapy. 67% of them had undergone at least to a single auSCT. All patients were relapsed and refractory to last therapies received before BVD. Results : Bendamustine was well tolerated, with grade 3 transfusion-dependent anemia in 41% of patients, and 37% grade 3 neutropenia (no ospedalization was required, no septic shocks were observed). No severe extrahematologic toxicity was observed, only grade 1 gastrointestinal side effect (nausea), treated by common antiemetic drugs. According to IMWG, after a median follow-up of 14 months (r.2-36), ORR was 64% (36/56: 4 CR, 7 VGPR, 16 PR, 9 MR) with 8 PD and 12 patients in SD, which can be considered as an impressive result in this subset of rrMM patients. In particular, for 11 patients, BVD was, after having achieved at least a PR, a bridge to second auSCT, and for two patients a bridge to alloSCT. Median time to response was 1.2 months (range, 1-3), median OS from diagnosis was 62.7 months (range, 6-151), median OS from start of Bendamustine was 9.8 months (range 2-36). Conclusion : BVD has shown significant efficacy in a particularly severe setting of patients, relapsed and refractory to all available therapeutic resources, and, in particular cases, it could be considered as a bridge to a second autologous or allogenic SCT.
