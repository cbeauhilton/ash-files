    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Defibrotide (DF) is a polydisperse oligonucleotide with anti-thrombotic, thrombolytic, anti-ischemic, and anti-adhesive properties, which selectively targets the microvasculature and has minimal hemorrhagic risk. DF is an effective treatment for veno-occlusive disease (VOD), an important regimen-related toxicity in stem cell transplantation characterized by endothelial cell injury. DF also augments stem cell mobilization by modulating adhesion in vivo . Because of its cytoprotective effect on the endothelium, we specifically investigated whether DF protects tumor cells from cytotoxic anti-tumor agents. Further, because of its broad anti-adhesive properties, we evaluated whether DF modulates the interaction of MM cells with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), which confers growth, survival and drug resistance in the BM milieu. Methods: In vitro studies in isogenic dexamethasone (Dex)-sensitive and resistant MM cell lines (MM-1S and MM1R, respectively) showed that DF does not attenuate the sensitivity of MM cells to Dex, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (PS-341), melphalan (MEL), vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine), taxanes (paclitaxel) or platinum (cisplatin), but does decrease their sensitivity to doxorubicin. These selective effects in vitro of DF in protecting tumor cells against doxorubicin and modestly sensitizing MM cells to platinum was also confirmed in solid tumor breast (MCF-7) and colon (HT-29) carcinoma cell lines. Although DF had minimal in vitro inhibitory effect on MM or solid tumor cell growth in vitro , it showed in vivo activity as a single agent and enhanced the responsiveness of MM tumors to cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, such as MEL or cyclophosphamide, in human MM xenografts in SCID/NOD mice. The in vivo single-agent activity and chemosensitizing properties of DF, coupled with its lack of major in vitro activity, suggested that DF may not directly target tumor cells, but rather modulate tumor cell interaction with BMSCs. In an ex vivo model of co-culture of primary MM tumor cells with BMSCs (which protects MM cells against conventional chemotherapy), DF alone had a only modest effect on tumor cell viability, but it significantly enhanced MM cell sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy (e.g. MEL), suggesting that a major component of the biological effects of DF may be attributable not to direct targeting of tumor cells, but to modulation of the interactions that tumor cells develop with the local stromal milieu. Conclusion: Our studies show that DF mediates in vivo anti-MM activity by abrogating interactions of MM cells with their BM milieu, thereby enhancing sensitivity and overcoming resistance to conventional chemotherapy. These data support future clinical trials of DF, in combination with both conventional and novel therapies, to improve patient outcome in MM.",
