    "abstract_text": "Background: NPM1 mutation, in the absence of FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), confers a survival advantage and lower risk of disease relapse in AML with normal diploid karyotype. The prognostic significance of mutated NPM1 in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT) for AML has not been described. Patients and methods: we evaluated the post-transplant outcomes of 156 patients (females=83, 53.2%), median age of 54 (19.5-71) years, with normal diploid karyotype and NPM1 Mutated FLT3-ITD Negative, who underwent an allogeneic HCT between 2006 and 2012. Donor source was limited to matched-related (MRD) or matched-unrelated (MUD) donors, and cell source consisted of bone marrow (BM) or G\u2013CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). Patient-, donor-, and disease-characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Results: the median time from diagnosis to allogeneic HCT was 310 (89-3713) days and the median follow-up from time of allografting was 32 (2-86) months. Overall, the 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR)and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 27% (20-35) and 13% (8-19) respectively, and the 2-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 37% (29-46). Finally, the 2-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) and the 2-year overall survival (OS) were 60% (51-68) and 70% (62-77), respectively. In univariate analysis, transplantation in CR1 was associated with lower2-year CIR [CR1=14% (7-23), CR2=37% (23-51), advanced/active=48%(26-67), p =0.0009], superior2-year LFS [CR1=75%(64-86), CR2=51% (36-65),advanced/active=30%(11-49), p< 0.0001] and superior2-year OS [CR1=81%(72-91), CR2=67% (54-80), advanced/active=39% (19-59), p< 0.0001]. Patients allografted from unrelated donors have higher 100-day cumulative incidence of > grade 2 acute GVHD [MUD=28% (19-39)vs. MRD=12%(5-22), p=0.02]. Patients older than 54.3 years had higher 2-year cumulative incidence of NRM [20% (11-31)vs. 7%[2-14], p=0.03] and inferior 2-year OS [61%(49-72) vs. 78% (68-88), p =0.02]. In multivariable analysis using a Cox proportional-hazard model, transplantation in CR1 resulted in lower2-year CIR and superior2-year LFS and OS. Conclusions : AML disease status at allografting remains the most important predictor of post-allogeneic HCT outcomes despite expression of mutated NPM1. Survival outcomes are better when patients are transplanted in CR1>CR2>advanced/active. The impact of other molecular abnormalities in conjunction with NPM1 is yet to be established. Also, a future matched-controlled analysis comparing AML patients with mutated vs. wild-type NPM1 expression in the setting of allogeneic HCT is warranted. Table 1  variables . Results N, (%) .
