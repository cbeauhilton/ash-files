    "abstract_text": "Reduced intensity stem cell transplantation (SCT) is an effective treatment modality for patients with hematologic malignancies who are not candidates for conventional myeloablative SCT. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients with hematologic malignancies receiving a reduced intensity allogeneic SCT from July 2002 to July 2007. Data pertaining to patient demographics, engraftment, disease status pre and post transplant, graft versus host disease (GVHD), and HLA matching was analyzed to identify factors significantly affecting the clinical outcome. Seventy three patients, with a median age of 55 (range of 19\u201370) and with the diagnoses of ALL (n=8), AML (n=30), CLL (n=3), CML (n=1), Hodgkin\u2019s (n=7), non-Hodgkin\u2019s (n=7), MDS (n=11), and MM (n=6) underwent a reduced intensity SCT using a fludarabine based conditioning regimen. Thirty nine (53%) received unrelated donor grafts and 34 (47%) received sibling donor grafts. Fifty six patients (77%) received fully matched grafts whereas 17 patients (23%) had an antigen or allele mismatch. Acute GVHD grade II-IV was observed in 27 of the 73 patients and chronic GVHD was seen in 18 of the 48 patients who could be evaluated. Seventeen patients developed transplant related fatal complications and 30 patients died from disease progression or relapse. Median time to neutrophil recovery was 15 days (range of 9\u201341 days) and median time to platelet recovery was 18 days (range of 9\u201342 days). Graft failure was observed in 6 of the 73 patients. Median overall survival and disease free survival for all patients was 7.7 and 6.6 months respectively. Median overall survival for patients with persistent disease or in remission at the time of the SCT was 5.6 and 21.8 months ( p= 0.01 ) while that for disease free survival was 5.7 and 8.4 months ( p=0.06 ). Median overall survival with and without chronic GVHD was 25.6 and 9.4 months ( p <0.0001 ) while median disease free survival was 18.2 and 6.0 months ( p< 0.0001 ). Patients with limited chronic GVHD have not yet reached median overall survival while the median disease free survival was 18.4 months. Those with no or extensive chronic GVHD had medians of 9.4 and 9.2 months for overall survival and 6.0 and 9.2 months for disease free survival ( p= 0.004 and p=0.02 ). The source of the stem cells as well as the administration of allele or single antigen mismatch grafts did not affect the outcome. Reduced intensity SCT is an effective treatment modality in patients with hematologic malignancies, though it is most effective in patients who are in remission at the time of transplant and should be offered in this setting. Patients with limited chronic GVHD had a better outcome suggesting the presence of potent anti-tumor activity of the donor immune competent cells without the detrimental effects in clinical outcome caused by extensive chronic GVHD."
