    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2549 The CATS protein (also known as FAM64A and RCS1) was first identified as a novel CALM (PICALM) interactor that interacts with and influences the subcellular localization of CALM/AF10, a leukemic fusion protein found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and in malignant lymphoma. CATS is highly expressed in leukemia, lymphoma and tumor cell lines but not in non-proliferating T-cells or in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). The protein levels of CATS are cell cycle-dependent, induced by mitogens (e.g. PHA) and correlate with the proliferative state of the cell. Thus, CATS is as a marker for proliferation. Using CATS as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen we identified the Kinase Interacting Stathmin (KIS or UHMK1) as a CATS interacting partner. KIS is a serine/threonine kinase that positively regulates cell cycle progression through phosphorylation of p27 KIP in leukemia cell lines. The interaction between CATS and KIS was confirmed by GST pull-down, and co-immunopreciptation. KIS interaction region was mapped to CATS N-terminal portion. Searching through the phosphorylation site databases PhosphoSitePlus\u2122 ( http://www.phosphosite.org ) and Phosida ( http://www.phosida.com/ ) we identified 9 residues within CATS shown to be subject of post-translational modification. Phosphorylation assay with recombinant KIS demonstrated that this kinase efficiently phosphorylated full length CATS and its N-terminal part, but not the C-terminal of the protein. To map the KIS phosphorylation site of CATS, peptides comprising all known phospho-sites of CATS N-terminal (S16, S129, S131, T133 and S135) and mutations of the putative KIS target motif (S129 and S131) were tested for KIS phosphorylation. Thereby, we identified CATS S131 as the unique target site for KIS phosphorylation. Western blot analysis of U2OS cells, which had undergone cell cycle synchronization by a double thymidine block, revealed that KIS fluctuated throughout the cell cycle and counteracted CATS levels. Furthermore, we analyzed KIS protein expression on bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs) of MDS and AML patients. We studied 5 healthy donors, 13 MDS patients (7 low-risk [RA/RARS] and 6 high-risk [RAEB/RAEBt] according to FAB classification) and 10 AML patients (7 de novo and 3 secondary). Western blot analysis revealed elevated levels of KIS in MDS and AML compared to the control samples. We used a reporter gene assay in order to determine the influence of KIS on the CATS-mediated transcriptional repression and to elucidate the role of KIS-dependent phosphorylation of CATS at serine 131 in this context. Coexpression of GAL4-DBD-CATS and KIS enhanced the inhibitory function of CATS on transactivation of the GAL4-tk-luciferase reporter. This effect of KIS was observed for both CATS wild type and CATS phospho-defective mutant (CATS S131A) but not when the kinase dead mutant KISK54R was used. Moreover, CATS phosphomimetic clone (CATSS131D) exerted the same transcriptional activity as the CATS wild type. These results demonstrate that KIS enhances the transcriptional repressor activity of CATS, and this effect is independent of CATS phosphorylation at S131 but dependent on the kinase activity of KIS. Finally, we investigated whether CATS would affect the CALM/AF10 function as an aberrant transcription factor. Coexpression of constant amounts of GAL4-DBD-CALM/AF10 and increasing amounts of CATS lead to reduced transactivation capacity of CALM/AF10 in a dose dependent manner. Our results show that CATS not only interacts with but is also a substrate for KIS, suggesting that CATS function might be modulated through phosphorylation events. The identification of the CATS-KIS interaction further supports the hypothesis that CATS plays an important role in the control of cell proliferation. Moreover the elevated levels of KIS in hematological malignances suggest that KIS could regulate CATS activity and/or function in highly proliferating leukemic cells. Thus our results indicate that CATS function might be important to understand the malignant transformation mediated by CALM/AF10. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
