    "abstract_text": "MALT lymphoma is a genetically unique disorder and five mutually exclusive chromosomal translocations have been identified thus far in this disease: t(11;18), t(14;18), t(1;14), t(1;2) and t(3;14). Despite this genetic heterogeneity, all but one of the translocations affect the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, which is critical if not essential for antigen receptor mediated B- and T-cell activation and likely enhances MALT lymphoma growth. However, the known translocations are present in only 25% of cases suggesting that additional uncharacterized translocations exist. We used long-distance inverse polymerase chain reaction (LDI-PCR) technique to clone a novel IGH translocation partner in a 60-year-old female with a history of Sjogren\u2019s syndrome and primary MALT lymphoma involving the parotid gland. The breakpoint on chromosome 14 occurred within the IGHSA2 switch region while the breakpoint on chromosome X fell within Xp11.4. The breakpoint on chromosome Xp11.2 fell between two genes, GPR82 and GPR34 , both of which code for orphan G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The breakpoint also fell within and disrupted a larger gene called CASK (a membrane-associated guanylate kinase-MAGUK). To determine the prevalence of this translocation in MALT lymphoma we performed interphase FISH studies on 64 MALT lymphomas using a breakapart probe for GPR82 . Only the index case had an abnormal split signal pattern. We next designed primers to perform real-time quantitative RT-PCR for the genes located on Xp11 and found that GPR34 RNA was highly expressed, a 49-fold increase, in the patient carrying the t(X;14)(p11.4;q32) translocation compared to a normal splenic B cell control. Expression of GPR82 and CASK RNA was similar between normal B cells and the patient carrying the t(X;14)(p11.4;q32) translocation. These data suggest that the GPR34 gene is dysregulated upon its translocation to the IGHSA2 switch region. We then measured GPR34 RNA expression in a panel of MALT lymphomas (n=12) and found that GPR34 was expressed at levels higher than that seen in normal B cells with an average increase of 11 fold, 9/11 of which had an expression lever greater than 3-fold over normal splenic B cells. In a gastric MALT lymphoma specimen arising in a 67-year-old male, we saw a 64 fold increase in GPR34 expression. Interphase FISH studies performed on this specimen showed an extra intact GPR34 signal but no translocation involving IGH or GPR34 , suggesting that other mechanisms, including gene dosage effect, can upregulate GPR34 . GPR34 RNA was also detected in other normal B cell populations and histologic subtypes of NHL but not to the extent seen in MALT lymphoma; values represent the expression of GPR34 normalized to \u03b2-actin and a normal B cell control (value of 1.0): t(X;14)(p11.4;q32) specimen, 49.0; MALT lymphoma, 11.0 (n=12); peripheral blood B cells, 0.48 (n=2); normal bone marrow B cells, 0.97 (n=3); follicular lymphoma, 2.47 (n=3); marginal zone B cell lymphoma, 2.47 (n=3); diffuse large cell lymphoma, 0.36, (n=3); mantle cell lymphoma, 2.67 (n=3); and multiple myeloma 0.52 (n=6). The receptor encoded by GPR34 is most similar to the PY2 receptor subfamily of GPCR and GPR34 mRNA transcripts are particularly abundant in mast cells while lower levels were detected in other immune cells including B cells. However, little is known about its natural ligand, biologic function, or the signaling cascades activated by its engagement. Because the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway has been shown to be a common downstream target of MALT lymphoma translocations we first examined the impact of GPR34 expression on phosphorylation of I\u03ba-B\u03b1. Transient expression of a YFP-GPR34 expression plasmid in HeLa cells results in increased phosphorylation of I\u03ba-B\u03b1 compared to the YFP control. Additionally, we observed increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in GPR34-expressing cells, however no change in phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 was detected. In summary, these data identify a novel IGHS translocation partner in MALT lymphoma and suggest that dysregulation of GPR34 is commonly found in MALT lymphoma. Overexpression of GPR34 results in activation of the NF-\u03baB and MAP kinase pathways and may be a novel mechanism by which MALT lymphoma occurs.",
