    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4058 Stratification models for prediction of the likelihood of success of peripheral blood stem cell collection via apheresis in patients are lacking. Peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ cells concentration ([CD34+]) pre-apheresis, and blood volume processed (BVP) have been shown to predict the CD34+ cell dose collected on the first day of apheresis (Pierelli et al Vox Sanguinis 2006, 91; 126 ). We sought to determine the predictive value of these factors, in addition to other mobilization and patient characteristics, in a total 851 consecutive autologous apheresis procedures performed at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 01/05\u201312/09. Patients and Methods: Baseline patient characteristics considered include age, gender, weight, diagnosis, complete blood counts on day of collection, and the absolute PB CD34+ counts within 24 hours of the first apheresis procedure. The study population was randomly divided into equal study (n=425) and validation (n=426) samples. Results: We report results of analyses performed on the study sample which included 241 Multiple Myeloma patients (pts), 135 Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma pts, and 49 Hodgkin's pts. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between CD34+ collected dose > 2 \u00d7 10 6 /Kg (available for 401/425 pts) and BVP (L); BVP/Kg; pre-apheresis blood counts including [CD34+], Hemoglobin level (\u226410 vs. >10 g/dL), WBC (4 x10 9 /L), absolute neutrophil count [ANC] (< vs.\u2265 median), and platelet count (\u2264150 vs. <150 x10 9 /L); days to first apheresis procedure from start of mobilization regimen (< vs. \u2265 median); patient's age (quartiles) and gender; and diagnosis. On univariate analysis, pre-apheresis [CD34+] count was the most significant predictor of CD34+ dose collected on the first day of apheresis (graph). Ninety-six percent of patients with [CD34+] >40/\u03bcL (n=158) collected >2 x10 6 CD34+ cells/Kg, while only 8% of those with [CD34+] \u2264 10/\u03bcL (n=25) reached that target. The proportion of patients who collected >2 x10 6 CD34+ cells/Kg increased from 15% to 67% with increasing [CD34+] counts ranging between11\u201340/\u03bcL (n=218). Additional significant predictors of higher CD34+ dose collected in this group of pts (n=218) included larger BVP/Kg (>0.2 L/Kg, n=50, p60 yrs (n=90, p0.06), and NHL histology (n=56, p 0.02) were associated with collection of lower CD34+yield/Kg. There was no impact of patient's weight or ANC. Multivariate analyses are ongoing to evaluate the independent prognostic value of these predictors. The resulting model will be validated in an independent sample. Conclusion: Patients whose pre-apheresis absolute CD34+ counts are between 11\u201340/\u03bcL may be able to collect a higher CD34+ cell dose/Kg on the first day of stem cell collection if higher blood volume is processed, especially patients who took longer to mobilize.
