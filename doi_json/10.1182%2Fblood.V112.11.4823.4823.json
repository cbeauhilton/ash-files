    "abstract_text": "For patients with severe SCD not eligible for hydroxyurea, two major therapeutic options are currently available: blood transfusion, and bone marrow transplantation. Either urgent or chronic red blood cell transfusion therapy, is widely used in the management of SCD but determines a progressive increase of ferritin level and is also limited by the development of antibodies to red cell antigens. The introduction of chronic red blood cell exchange and prestorage filtration to remove leucocytes and the use of techniques for multicomponent donation could be a good solutions. Thus, the aims of our studies were to evaluate the clinical effects of the different blood components in terms of annual transfusion needs and the intervals between transfusion, moreover we evaluated the efficacy of chronic red blood cell exchange (manual or automatic with cell separator) in preventing SCD complications and limiting iron overload. In our center we follow 78 patients affected by Sickle Cell Disease. We selected 36 patients occasionally treated with urgent red blood cell exchange because they had less than 2 complications/Year, and 42 patients regularly treated with chronic red blood cell exchange because they had more than 2 complications/Year with Hospital Admission. Moreover among these we selected 10 patients for fulfilling the criteria of continuous treatment at the Centre for at least 48 months with no interruptions, even sporadic and absolute transfusion dependency. All 10 patients were evaluated for a period of 4 years, during which two different systems of producing RCC were used. In the second two the patients were transfused with RCC obtained from filtering whole blood prestorage or with RCC from apheresis filtered prestorage. These products differed from those used in the preceding two years, during which the leucodepletion was obtained by bed-side filtration For all the patients we performed 782 automatic red blood cell exchanges and 4421 units of RCC were transfused. The exchange procedures were extremely well-tolerated by the patients and adverse effects were limited to symptoms of hypocalcaemia during automatic red blood cell exchange with cell separator. After every red blood cell exchange we obtained HbS level < 30%. The10 patients selected received respectively a mean of 6.9 and 6.1 units of RBCs exchanged per automatic procedure, in the first two years and in the second two years. Alloantibody developed in 14 patients but only 2 clinically significant and about the observed frequency of transfusion reactions it was very low. All patients treated with chronic red blood cell exchange had an improvement of the quality of life with a reduced number of complications/year (<2/year) and good compliance and moreover patients had limited iron overload making chelating therapy easier. In conclusion this study was focused on the most suitable characteristics of blood components for use in sickle cell disease patients and the choice of systematically adopting prestorage filtration of whole blood , enabled us to have RCC with a higher Hb concentration than standard. Moreover chronic manual or automatic red blood cell exchange as an alternative approach to simple long-term RBC transfusions give many advantages by being more rapid and tolerable as well as clinically safe and effective and minimize the development of iron overload especially when procedure was carried out with an automatic apparatus. To note that the clinical advantages for patients derived from good selection of the donor and good practices in the production of the blood components"
