Methods Investigate all hospitalized patients who transfused various blood components from November 2006 to July 2009. Results During study period, there were 27,672 times transfusion with 80,112 units various blood components, mainly red blood cells(RBCs), frozen plasma(FP) and leukocyte-depleted platelets(PLTs). Acute transfusion reactions occured in 143 patients of 159 times transfusion, including febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions(FNHTR), allergic transfusion reactions(ATR), transfusion-related acute lung injury(TRALI), transfusion-associated circulatory overload(TACO) and hemorrhagic tendency. The 143 enrolled patients, 87male and 56female, were between the age of 16 and 94. The incidence rate of acute transfusion reaction was 0.57%, FNHTR and ATR accounted for 96.23%. Of all blood components, the incidence rates of acute reaction were 0.35%, 0.50% and 1.82% respectively in RBCs, FP and PLTs transfusions. In 159 times of acute transfusion reactions, the constituent ratios of 0\u223c3 times and more than 3 times transfusion were 23.27%, 18.87%, 7.55%, 4.40% and 45.91%, respectively. Conclusion Most of acute transfusion reactions were FNHTR and ATR. The highest incidence rate was in platelets transfusion, and the most constituent ratio was in patients who have received more than 3 times transfusion.
