    "abstract_text": "Primary light chain amyloidosis (AL) is associated with a subtle monoclonal plasma cell population. Due to the small percentage and low mitotic index of these abnormal plasma cells, cytogenetic studies in AL have been restricted to analysis by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH), with published reports of 5% plasma cells); 12 (40%) patients had IgH translocations: t(11;14)(q13;q32) n=10 (33%) (7 in patients with >5% plasma cells); unknown translocation partner n=2 (6%). Treatment data was available for seven patients: six (20%) had combination chemotherapy of which 3 (50%) were responders and three (10%) had successful autologous PBSCT. There was no association of any specific chromosomal abnormality with the pattern of organ involvement or response to treatment. Median follow-up was 22 months. Median overall survival (OS) of patients with systemic AL was 11 months (range 2\u201361). There was a difference, although not to statistically significant levels, between patients with chromosomal abnormalities compared to those without [median OS 7 months (range 2\u201361) vs. 14 months (range 2\u201342); p= 0.34], in particular, for patients with del(13) [7 months (range 2\u201361) vs. 15 months (range 2\u201342); p=0.28]. t(11;14) did not appear to impact survival[median OS 12 months (range 2\u201361) vs.11 months (range 2\u201342); p=0.43]. In conclusion, chromosomal abnormalities appear to be more frequent in AL patients with \u2265 5% plasma cells in their bone marrow. Presence of any chromosomal abnormality and specifically del(13) are associated with a trend towards a poorer outcome. A larger study is in progress to further investigate these observations.",
