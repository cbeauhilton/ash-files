    "abstract_text": "Abstract 428 Lenalidomide (R) has significant activity in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). R has also shown activity in patients with AL amyloidosis, especially in combination with dexamethasone (D). However, AL patients are usually frail and R at the standard dose of 25 mg/day has been associated with significant toxicity. In MM patients, R with low dose D (Rd) has a better toxicity profile than the combination of R with high dose D. Alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide (C), are active in patients with AL and combinations of R with alkylating agents have given promising results in patients with MM. Thus, we designed a phase I/II trial of R, with low dose D and low dose C (RdC) in patients with AL. Primary objective of the study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for RdC and to assess hematologic response. Patients receive D 20 mg on days 1-4 (total 80 mg per cycle) , C on days 1-10, R on days 1-21 every 28 days, according to dose level (level 0: R 10 mg, C 50 mg, level 1: R 10 mg, C 100 mg, level 2: R 15 mg, C 100 mg). In the phase I part of the study, patients were observed for 2 cycles for determination of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) according to a standard 3+3 design. Patients with a creatinine \u22642.5 mg/dL and adequate hepatic function were enrolled. All patients receive low-dose aspirin or LMWH if indicated. So far 23 patients have been enrolled in the study (16 in phase I, 7 in phase II). In the phase I study, 3 patients were enrolled in dose level 0, 7 in dose level 1 and 6 in dose level 2. Dose level 2, (R 15 mg, C 100 mg) is being further explored; 7 patients have been enrolled in phase II and accrual is ongoing. So far, 132 cycles of therapy have been administered; 8 patients have receive \u22656 cycles of RdC and 3 have completed 12 cycles of treatment. According to consensus criteria, heart was involved in 65%, kidneys in 61%, liver in 9% and 17% had AL-related peripheral neuropathy; 95% of the patients were Mayo stage II or III. Most patients (70%) were previously untreated. Among 7 pretreated patients, 2 had refractory disease, 2 had prior thalidomide and 5 had prior bortezomib. Hematologic response rates for patients who received at least 2 cycles of treatment, among all cohorts, was 64% and for the patients treated at dose level 2 was 75%. Median time to hematologic response was 2.5 months (range 0.9-4.8 months) for all patients and 1 month (range 0.9-2.9) for those treated at dose level 2. Organ responses have been recorded in 5 patients so far (3 cardiac and 3 renal responses, 1 patient had both cardiac and renal response). After a median follow-up of 7 months, 7 patients have died; 5 due to progressive heart amyloid, one patient had an acute MI followed by acute stent thrombosis and one died due to sepsis. The most common hematologic toxicities were anemia (grade 3/4 in 17%) and neutropenia (grade 3/4 in 17%). Most common non-hematologic toxicities were infection (grade \u22653 in 22%), fatigue (grade \u22653 in 9%), and rash (in 22%, grade 3 in 4%); also one patient suffered a stroke and one had DVT while on treatment with RdC. In parallel, and on a compassionate basis, AL patients with creatinine >2.5 mg/dL or on dialysis, were offered RdC with R dose adjusted according to CrCl. Initially R was given 15 mg every other day for CrCl <30 ml/min, or 15 mg thrice per week on the day after dialysis but due to toxicity R dose was reduced to 10 mg. So far, 13 patients have been treated with attenuated-dose RdC: 3 patients achieved a CR, one achieved a cardiac and one patient a liver response. However, the non-hematologic toxicity of the combination in patients with renal impairment was significant including fatigue (53%), infections (38%), rash (31%), diarrhea (15%), hyponatriemia (15%). Three patients discontinued treatment due to toxicity after the 1 st cycle (including one early death due to non-neutropenic infection). In conclusion, RdC is an effective oral regimen for patients with AL amyloidosis, inducing significant rates of hematologic and organ responses. The recommended dose for RdC was R at dose of 15 mg, C at a dose of 100 mg and 20 mg of D and is further evaluated in the phase II of the study. Toxicity is manageable for patients with serum creatinine <2.5 mg/dL but can be significant for AL patients with more severe renal impairment. Lower doses of R, at 10 mg or less every other day or thrice per week should be used in these patients. Accrual in the phase II study is ongoing and updated results will be presented at the meeting.
