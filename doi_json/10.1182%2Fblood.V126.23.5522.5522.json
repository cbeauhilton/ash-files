    "abstract_text": "Objective To evaluate the treatment outcomes of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in patients with T-cell lymphom / leukemia (TCL),observe hematopoietic reconstitution and transplant-related complications. Methods Seventeen TCL patients received HSCT from 2005 to 2013 in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed.Of the 17 patients,6 were T lymphoblastic lymphoma / leukemia (T-LBL),3 were Peripheral T-cell lymphoma / leukemia (PTL),2 were Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL),2 were Extranodal NK / T-cell lymphoma (NK / TCL),1 were Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (ATCL) and 3 were Acute T lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) with a median age of 35(19~67) years old.Ratio of male to female is 13F4. The distribution of stages was 2(14.2%),0(0%)and 12(85.7%) patients with stages II,III,and IV,respectively. The distribution according to international prognostic index (IPI) was 8(57.1%) patients in 2 score,1(7.1%) in 3 scores and 5 (35.7%) in 4 scores. Results \u2021@17 patients were successfully engrafted, the median time of absolute neutrophil count(ANC) > 0.5\u00d710 9 /L was 11(8~15) days, the median time of platelet > 20\u00d710 9 /L was 13(8~18) days. 3 cases developed I degree acute GVHD, all patients were improved after treatment. \u2021AAt a median follow-up of 36 (range,12-96) months,12 patients were alive and 5 relapsed and died from TCL after ASCT. The estimated 5-year probability of DFS and OS was (72.1\u00b115.2)% and (59.7\u00b115.2)% for all the patients. Conclusion The results showed that HSCT may significantly improve long-term outcome for patients with T-cell lymphoma / leukemia (TCL). Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
