    "abstract_text": "Thrombin activates protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) on endothelial cells (ECs) and regulates many aspects of EC biology. A body of evidence has demonstrated that the thrombin-PAR1 pathway is critical for angiogenesis and vascular development. However, the mechanism underlying the proangiogenic effect of thrombin has not been elucidated yet. Here, we report the discovery of a novel functional link between thrombin-PAR1 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathways. Using mass spectrometry, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, cell surface ELISA and a phospho-specific antibody against the serine-phosphorylated endogin, we demonstrated for the first time that thrombin via PAR1 induced the internalization of endoglin and type-II TGF-\u03b2 receptor (T\u03b2RII) but not the type-I receptors in primary human ECs. This effect was mediated by protein kinase C-\u03b6 (PKC-\u03b6) that was rapidly activated by thrombin in ECs since specific inhibition of PKC-\u03b6 caused aggregation of endoglin and T\u03b2RII on cell surface and blocked their internalization in response to thrombin. Furthermore, acute (30 min) and long-term (24 h) pretreatment of ECs with thrombin or PAR1 peptide agonist suppressed the TGF-\u03b2-induced serine phosphorylation of Smad2/3, the critical mediators of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Moreover, activation of PAR1 led to a profound clustering formation of Smad2/3 and a more spread cytosolic localization, which sequestered Smad2/3 from nucleus and prevented their nuclear translocation evoked by TGF-\u03b2. Since TGF-\u03b2 and its receptors play a crucial role in the resolution phase of angiogenesis, the downregulation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by thrombin-PAR1 pathway may provide a new insight into the mechanism of the proangiogenic effect of thrombin."
