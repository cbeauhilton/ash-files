    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1096 The macrophage-mediated inflammatory response plays a critical role in the development of obesity-related tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. Free-fatty acids (FFAs) are well-characterized factors causing production of inflammatory factors and insulin resistance. Glia maturation factor-gamma (GMFG), a member of the ADF/cofilin family of proteins that regulate actin cytoskeleton reorganization, is preferentially expressed in inflammatory cells, but its function in the macrophages immune response remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether GMFG may affect FFAs-induced inflammatory reaction in macrophages. We show here that silencing of GMFG (80% inhibition of the endogenous expression levels) by transfected with GMFG siRNA significantly enhanced FFAs-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8 compared to transfected non-targeting silencing siRNA in human peripheral blood monocytes-derived macrophage (1.2 \u00d7 10 4 \u00b1 224.2 vs. 4.6 \u00d7 10 3 \u00b1 98.4 molecules/ng, P < 0.001; 1.2 \u00d7 10 3 \u00b1 56.1 vs. 2.3 \u00d7 10 2 \u00b1 8.4 molecules/ng, P =0.001; 1.3 \u00d7 10 7 \u00b1 5.8 \u00d7 10 5 vs. 4.9 \u00d7 10 6 \u00b1 2.8 \u00d7 10 5 molecules/ng, P < 0.001) as determined by quantitative real time-PCR and confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (TNF-\u03b1: 9.4 \u00d7 10 2 \u00b1 38.6 vs. 5.6 \u00d7 10 2 \u00b1 31.1 ng/mL, P < 0.01; IL-6: 4.5 \u00d7 10 2 \u00b1 31.3 vs. 2.2 \u00d7 10 2 \u00b1 22.7 ng/mL, P < 0.01; IL-8: 2.2 \u00d7 10 3 \u00b1 205.5 vs. 1.3 \u00d7 10 3 \u00b1 113.9 ng/mL, P < 0.01). These increased inflammatory cytokines resulted from an increased activation of NF-\u03baB and the ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway (based on increased NF-\u03baB p65 phosphorylation, I\u03baB\u03b1 loss and enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in Western blot analysis) and a reduced phosphorylation of the PI3K/Akt/GSK3-\u03b2 pathway following FFAs stimulation. Overexpression of GFP-GMFG in GMFG-silenced cells abrogated enhanced phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB p65, ERK1/2 MAPK and reduced phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3-\u03b2. Furthermore, in cells in which GMFG was knockdown, FFAs induced an increase in the expression of SHIP1, a phosphatase that negatively regulates the PI3K signaling pathway, suggesting increased SHIP1 expression may be responsible for the augmentation of inflammatory cytokines following FFAs stimulation. We also show that silencing of GMFG enhances the oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) induced expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 (2.9 \u00d7 10 4 \u00b1 204.8 vs. 1.3 \u00d7 10 4 \u00b1 153.9 molecules/ng, P < 0.01; 2.5 \u00d7 10 3 \u00b1 31.3 vs. 9.2 \u00d7 10 2 \u00b1 22.7 ng/mL, P < 0.01) in MDM. Taking together with the data that GMFG is constitutively expressed in macrophages and its expression is down-regulated by FFAs stimulation, GMFG might function as a novel negative regulator through participating in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, suggesting that macrophage-specific modulation of GMFG may be beneficial in the treatment of FFAs induced inflammation.
