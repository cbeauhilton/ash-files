    "abstract_text": "Objective To explore the effects and interactions of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists and chloride channel blockers on the platelet cytoplasmic free calcium ([Ca 2+ ]i ). Methods We washed and suspended fresh platelets with Hepes buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), then loaded platelets with 5\u03bcmol/L Fura-3/AM. Then RGDS, the GPIIb/IIIa antagonists, and the chloride channel blockers 4,4\u2032-diisothiocyano-2,2\u2032-disulfonic acid stilbene(DIDS) or niflumic acid(NFA) were added to the platelet suspension. After 2 minutes incubating, we observed the effects and interactions of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists and chloride channel blockers on platelet [Ca 2+ ]i by measuring the Fura-3 fluorescence intensity. Results 1. Effects of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists and chloride channel blockers on platelet [Ca 2+ ]i. The fluorescence intensity of resting platelet [Ca 2+ ]i were 369.6\u00b162.2, 381.9\u00b172.4, 392.8 \u00b169.9 after adding RGDS(250 \u03bcmol/L), DIDS(100 \u03bcmol/L) or NFA( 100 \u03bcmol/L) respectively. every agent had no significant effect on resting [Ca 2+ ]i ( p >0.05). After thrombin(0.03 U/ml) stimulating and adding RGDS(250 \u03bcmol/L), DIDS(100 \u03bcmol/L) or NFA( 100 \u03bcmol/L), the platelet [Ca 2+ ]i were 883.9\u00b1107.0, 789.8\u00b199.8, 564.1\u00b179.4. Compare with the control(977.9\u00b1108.8), the three agents could inhibit the elevation of [Ca 2+ ]i stimulated by thrombin ( p <0.05). The inhibiting rates were (9.37\u00b17.5)%, (18.7\u00b110.4)% and (41.8\u00b110.1)% respectively. 2. Combined effects of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists and chloride channel blockers The fluorescence intensity of resting platelet [Ca 2+ ]i was 383.9\u00b167.9 after incubated with RGDS and DIDS. That had no significant effects. When platelets were stimulated by thrombin (0.03 U/ml), the combined inhibition rate was (24.4\u00b110.8)%, RGDS and DIDS couldn\u2019t weaken or enhance each other on thrombin-induced elevation of [Ca 2+ ]i ( p >0.05). Neither RGDS nor NFA had significant combined effects on resting [Ca2+]i( p >0.05). The combined inhibition rate was (46.0\u00b17.3)%, they had no interactions too( p >0.05). Conclusion The GPIIb/IIIa antagonists RGDS and the chloride channel blockers DIDS or NFA have no effect on resting platelet [Ca 2+ ]i. All of them can inhibit the elevation of platelet [Ca 2+ ]i induced by thrombin. There are no interactions between GPIIb/IIIa antagonists RGDS and chloride channel blockers (DIDS or NFA) in resting platelet [Ca 2+ ]i and elevation of platelet [Ca 2+ ]i induced by thrombin, and their effects were independent.",
