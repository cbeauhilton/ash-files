    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1089 Introduction: T2* Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique allows noninvasive quantification of organ-specific iron burden, playing a key role in the management of thalassemia major (TM) patients. There are few data on the incidence of heart failure and arrhythmias in TM patients according to baseline T2* values. The aim of this study was to establish prospectively the risk of cardiac complications in a large cohort of well-treated TM patients. Methods: We considered 527 TM patients (252 males, mean age 30\u00b19) for who clinical data relative to a period of 5 years after the first MRI were collected in a central data base. At time of the first scan mean ferritin levels were1653\u00b11559 ng/l, global heart was 27\u00b113 ms, and excellent/good level of compliance were present in the 96% of the study population. Results: At 5 years of follow-up, we recorded 24 cardiac events: 4 episodes of cardiac failure, 15 of arrhythmia, 1 of pulmonary hypertension and 4 of other cardiac complications. The majority of these events (21/24) happened within the first 24 months subsequent to the MRI, so we considered this follow-up period. At the first MRI scan, in patients with cardiac complications the global heart T2* was 22.5 \u00b112.4 ms. In comparison with global heart T2* values \u226520 ms, there was not a significantly increased risk of cardiac complications associated with global heart T2* values <20 ms (HR= 2.028 P=0.09) (see figure ). In the heart failure patients the global heart T2* was 19\u00b112 ms. In comparison with global heart T2* values \u226520 ms, there was not a significantly increased risk of heart failure associated with global heart T2* values <20 ms (HR=1.9 P=0.524) or <10 ms (HR=2.6 P=0.443).

In comparison with global heart T2* values \u226520 ms, there was not a significantly increased risk of arrhythmia associated with global heart T2* values  25% of the study population. Conclusion: We detected very few cardiac events, almost all concentrated in the first 24 months. In a large cohort of well-treated TM patients heart T2* lost its power in predicting cardiac events probably due to a patient-specific adjustment of the chelation therapy MRI-guided.
