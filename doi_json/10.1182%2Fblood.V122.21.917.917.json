    "abstract_text": "Avascular necrosis (AVN) of the bone is a painful and debilitating complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) that is associated with significant morbidity and often requires surgery. Risk factors for its development in pediatric allogeneic HCT recipients are not well described. To assess risk factors for AVN in children and adolescents following allogeneic HCT, we conducted a nested case-control study with a matched cohort of 638 patients reported to the Center of International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research who were \u2264 21 years of age, received their first allogeneic transplant between 1990 to 2008 in the United States and had survived \u2265 6 months from HCT. Overall, 160 cases with AVN were identified. Each case was matched with up to 3 controls by same year of HCT, similar length of follow-up and by transplant center (478 controls). Cases and controls were confirmed via central review of radiology, pathology and/or surgical procedure reports. The median age for cases was 15 (range 2-21) years, 49% were male, 65% had acute leukemia, 65% had received high-dose total body irradiation (TBI) based conditioning regimen, and 65% had received unrelated donor HCT. Among cases, 18% had a history of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) while 56% had a history of chronic GVHD prior to development of AVN. Median time from HCT to diagnosis of AVN was 14 (range <1-172) months. We evaluated age, gender, diagnosis, conditioning regimen, TBI, donor source and GVHD as risk factors for AVN. On conditional logistic regression, increasing age at HCT, female gender and chronic GVHD were significantly associated with increased risks of AVN. Compared to patients receiving myeloablative regimens for malignant diseases, lower risks of AVN were seen in patients with non-malignant diseases and those who had received reduced intensity conditioning regimen for malignant diseases. ( Table ). Patients receiving unrelated donor transplant had lower risks of AVN compared to HLA-identical sibling donor HCT recipients; there was no significant interaction between donor source and GVHD status. Lack of data on pre- and post-HCT steroid exposure was a limitation of our study. Our findings suggest that children at high risk for AVN include those within the age group where rapid bone growth occurs as well as those who experience exposure to high-dose myeloablative conditioning regimens and immunosuppression post-HCT for the treatment of GVHD. Our study identifies important risk factors for AVN in a large cohort of pediatric HCT recipients. Future studies should evaluate the role of surveillance and preventive strategies for AVN in pediatric HCT recipients who are at high risk for development of AVN.
