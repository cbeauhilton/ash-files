    "abstract_text": "Dysplastic features can be detected in different cell lineages in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC). The aim of the present study has been the assessment of the flow cytometric detection of dysplastic features previously published to occur in MDS in relation to findings in cytomorphology (CM) and cytogenetics (CG). We analyzed 307 bone marrow samples from patients with suspected (n=130) or proven (n=177) MDS by MFC, CM, and CG in parallel. Blast counts as determined by CM and MFC, respectively, ranged from 0% to 21% (median, 3.5%) and from 0% to 23% (median, 3%; r=0.271, p5% occurred in 68.4%, 63.3%, and 35.3% of cases with MDS, possible MDS, and non-MDS according to CM (p=0.0005). Interestingly, in some cases aberrant antigen expression has been observed in cell lineages not rated dysplastic by CM. This evaluation suggests that MFC may be used to identify dysplastic features in patients with suspected MDS. Sensitivity and specificity varies between MDS subtypes and should be clearly defined in future studies.",
