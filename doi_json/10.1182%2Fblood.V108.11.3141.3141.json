    "abstract_text": "Between 1996 and 2003, 994 patients aged under 60 years with de novo AML received a double induction chemotherapy consisting of MAV (mitoxantrone 10 mg/m 2 day 4\u20138, Ara-C 100 mg/m 2 continuous infusion day 1\u20138, etoposide 100 mg/m 2 day 4\u20138) and MAMAC after an interval of at least 14 days (Ara-C 1 g/m 2 q. 12 hrs day 1\u20135, amsacrine 100 mg/m 2 day 1\u20135). A cytogenetic high risk profile (complex aberrations, \u22125/del(5q), \u22127/del(7q), hypodiploid karyotypes other than \u22125, \u22127, \u2212X, \u2212Y, abnl3q, abnl1q, abnl12p, t(6;9), t(9;22), t(9;11), +11, +13, +21, +22) was present in 252 patients (de novo AML [N=160], prior MDS [N=41], and secondary AML [N=51]). 119 out of 252 (47%) were in complete remission after 2 induction cycles. 35 (14%) additional patients showed complete remission after a further cycle. Patients with a HLA matched sibling donor (N=37) or an unrelated donor (N=34) received an allogeneic transplantation as consolidation therapy. The conditioning protocol consisted of 12 Gy TBI and cyclophosphamide. Cyclosporine and methotrexate were used as GvH prophylaxis. The actuarial survival at 5 years is 42% (CI: 26%\u201358%) in the related donor group and 53% (CI: 36%\u201370%) in the unrelated donor group. The disease free survival at 5 years is 40% (CI: 24%\u201356%) in the related group and 43% (CI: 26%\u201360%) in the unrelated group (for both, p=ns). In conclusion, the results after unrelated donor transplants are comparable with those after related donor transplants in patients with high risk AML. These data of the AML\u201996 study will be compared with the experience of our current upfront concept using allogeneic transplantation in aplasia after the 1 st or 2 nd induction cycle in high risk AML."
