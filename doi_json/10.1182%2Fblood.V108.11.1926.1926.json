    "abstract_text": "Typical acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is associated with expression of the PML/RAR\u03b1 fusion protein resulting from chromosomal translocation t(15;17) and responsiveness to treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). A few population of APL is associated with variant chromosomal translocations, t(11;17), t(5;17) and t(17;17). PLZF/RAR\u03b1 is the chimeric fusion protein resulting from the chromosomal translocation, t(11;17)(q23;q21). APL cells with PLZF/RAR\u03b1 have been reported to be unresponsive to ATRA-induced terminal differentiation clinically and experimentally. The molecular basis of unresponsiveness in PLZF/RAR\u03b1-derived APL cells against ATRA explained by a rigid interaction between BTB/POZ domain of PLZF and a transcriptional co-repressor, N-CoR. PLZF/RAR\u03b1 contains BTB/POZ domain in its N-terminus. BTB/POZ domain is developmentally conserved among various species, and recently several BTB/POZ-containing molecules have been reported to function as substrate-specific adaptors for Cul3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase. Here we examined the possibility that PLZF/RAR\u03b1 functions as an E3 ligase. We performed the series of transient transfection analysis. By immunoprecipitation assay, PLZF/RAR\u03b1 associated with Cul3, and PLZF/RAR\u03b1 also associated with RXR\u03b1. PLZF/RAR\u03b1 accelerated an ubiquitin-dependent degradation of RXR\u03b1, and resulted in the decreased expression of RXR\u03b1. This degradation of RXR\u03b1 was dependent on the expression level of PLZF/RAR\u03b1. On the contrary, co-expression of dominant negative form of Cul3 with PLZF/RAR\u03b1 resulted in the restored expression of RXR\u03b1. When we expressed PML/RAR\u03b1, PLZF or PLZF/RAR\u03b1\u0394BTB, the accelerated degradation of RXR\u03b1 was not observed. In RAR\u03b1-responsive luciferase assay, PLZF/RAR\u03b1 repressed ATRA response. Consistent with the result that PLZF/RAR\u03b1\u0394BTB did not down-regulate the expression of RXR\u03b1, PLZF/RAR\u03b1\u0394BTB did not repress ATRA response. In addition, the transduction of recombinant RXR\u03b1 molecule into PLZF/RAR\u03b1 expressing cells partially restored ATRA-responsiveness. Collectively, we suggest that ATRA resistance in PLZF/RAR\u03b1-positive cells is explained by the novel function of PLZF/RAR\u03b1 molecule."
