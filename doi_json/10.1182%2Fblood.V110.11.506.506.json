    "abstract_text": "Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a conserved cellular surveillance system that degrades mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs). PTC-containing transcripts can arise from faulty events such as erroneous mRNA processing events as well as mutations, and their translation may lead to the synthesis of deleterious proteins. In addition to serving as a genomic protection system, experiments in tissue culture cells have demonstrated that NMD regulates 5% of the normal mRNA pool suggesting that the NMD pathway may have a broader role in gene regulation. Finally, NMD has also been proposed to be important during lymphocyte development as a tool of riding the cells of transcripts resulting from unproductive re-arrangements events of T cell receptor and immunoglobulin genes. Although NMD has been studied extensively at the biochemical level, the actual role and importance of NMD in the mammalian organism has not been investigated. We therefore generated a conditional Upf2 knock-out mouse line (UPF2 being an essential NMD factor) which we crossed to different hematopoietic relevant Cre expressing lines. Full ablation of UPF2 (using the inducible Mx1-Cre deleter) led to complete loss of all nucleated cells in the bone marrow and death of the animals within 10 days. A similar phenotype was observed when Upf2fl/fl; Mx1Cre BM cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated WT recipients and induced with poly-IC, demonstrating the cell autonomous nature of the phenotype. Deletion of UPF2 in the myeloid lineage using the LysM-Cre deleter resulted in efficient ablation of UPF2 and the absence of NMD in reporter transfected bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs). However, the steady state levels of myeloid cells appeared unaltered. Finally, deletion of UPF2 in T cells using a Lck-Cre deleter led to a marked reduction of both CD4/CD8 double-positive and single-positive T cells and accumulation of PTC containing transcripts. Gene expression profiling experiments of BMDM and thymocytes from WT and UPF2-ablated animals identified a common core set of 27 up-regulated genes consistent with the role of NMD as a mRNA degrading system. The gene expression profiling data suggest that ablation of NMD leads to accumulation of unfolded proteins. In summary, these studies demonstrate the vital and cell-autonomous role of NMD in the hematopoietic system.",
