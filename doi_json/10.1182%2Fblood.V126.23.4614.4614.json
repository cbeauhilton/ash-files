    "abstract_text": "Introduction It's generally considered that all alloimmune process such as acute graft-versus host disease (aGVHD) after allo-HSCT are mostly controlled by lymphocytes. The role of neutrophils in systemic alloimmunity after allo-HSCT is still illusive. In 1987 a distinct subset of proinflammatory, low-density granulocytes (LDGs) isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cell fractions of patients with system lupus erythematosus has been described. There is no LDG's in healthy donors. While the origin and role of LDGs still needs to be fully characterized, we try to describe this population in patients with hematological malignancies after allo-HSCT Patients and methods. Peripheral blood samples were collected in EDTA-tubes before allo-HSCT, on day +30,+60,+90 after allo-HSCT and at day of aGVHD from 47 patients with hematological malignancies (AML=22, ALL n=17, LPD=3, MDS =2; CML=2; 17 with active disease, 30 - in CR) after allo-HSCT (from matched unrelated donor n=34, from matched related donor n=13; MAC = 13, RIC=34). Isolation of mononuclear cells from human peripheral blood was made by standard protocol using Lympholyte\u00ae-M Cell Separation Media (Cedarlane Labs). The anti-CD66b-PE (Biolegend, USA) antibodies and FSC/SSC were used to determine LDGs cells as FSC high \\SSC high \\CD66b + . 100000 of cells were analyzed on a BD FACSCanto II (Becton Dickinson, USA). Results. Results of blood evaluation of 47 patients with hematological malignancies, whose blood was examined after allo-HSCT presented in table 1. Conclusion Despite the fact that we don't get significant differences. LDG's detection in allo-HSCT patients need further investigation. Table 1.
