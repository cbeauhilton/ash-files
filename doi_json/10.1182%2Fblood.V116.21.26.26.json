    "abstract_text": "Abstract 26 Background: Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) typically arises from a pre-leukemic pre-B cell clone, which was established in utero (Greaves and Wiemels, 2003). This led to a scenario, in which the initial prenatal lesion is followed by a series of additional transforming events, which ultimately cause malignant transformation of a pre-B cell clone. For instance, the TEL-AML1 gene rearrangement defines the most frequent type of childhood ALL and is detected in \u223c1% cord blood samples compared to the cumulative risk for TEL-AML1 ALL at 1:14,000. These findings support the notion that covert pre-leukemic clones are frequent but only a small minority of them develop into frank pre-B leukemia after critical secondary genetic lesions were acquired. The postnatal mechanism(s) that drive the evolution of the fetal pre-leukemic clone towards childhood ALL are not known. Hypothesis: We have recently demonstrated that aberrant somatic hypermutation activity of AID propagates progression of CML into lymphoid blast crisis (Klemm et al., 2009) and clonal evolution of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Gruber et al., 2010). Here we test the hypothesis that premature expression of AID in human pre-B cells promotes the acquisition of secondary genetic lesions and propagates the clonal evolution of a pre-leukemic pre-B cell towards childhood ALL. Results: We performed a comprehensive analysis of human B cell development in bone marrow samples from two children carrying deleterious mutations of the IL7RA gene encoding one chain of the human IL7 receptor. As opposed to normal human pre-B cells, pre-B cells from IL7RA -mutant patients carried somatically mutated immunoglobulin genes. Premature hypermutation in IL7R\u03b1-deficient pre-B cells was consistent with aberrant expression of AID in these cells. This led to the hypothesis that signaling via IL7R\u03b1 suppresses premature activation of AID-dependent hypermutation. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated mouse pre-B cells with LPS in the presence or absence of IL7, which is normally abundantly present in the bone marrow. While pre-B cells did not respond to LPS in the presence of IL7, IL7 withdrawal dramatically sensitized pre-B cells to LPS exposure: in the absence of IL7, LPS-stimulation of pre-B cells resulted in similar AID protein levels as in splenic germinal center B cells, where AID is normally active. We confirmed these observations studying pre-B cells from an AID-GFP reporter transgenic mouse strain. While LPS resulted in \u223c2% AID-GFP + cells in the presence of IL7, the fraction of AID-GFP + cells increased to \u223c45% when IL7 was removed. Since IL7R\u03b1 signaling involves Stat5 phosphorylation, we studied inducible deletion of both Stat5a and Stat5b in Stat5-fl/fl pre-B cells. Inducible deletion of Stat5a and Stat5b in pre-B cells had the same effect as IL7 withdrawal and led to transcriptional de-repression of AID. IL7R\u03b1/Stat5 signaling likely involves negative regulation of FoxO3A via AKT since expression of a constitutively active FoxO3A mutant potentiated AID expression in pre-B cells. We next searched for a normal pre-B cell subset, in which loss of IL7R\u03b1/Stat5 signaling occurs naturally. Since inducible activation of pre-B cell receptor signaling results in downregulation of IL7R\u03b1 surface expression, we tested pre-B cell receptor-positive stages of B cell development. Interestingly, AID mRNA levels were increased by >10-fold at the transition from IL7R\u03b1-positive Fraction C\u2019 pre-B cells to IL7R\u03b1-negative Fraction D pre-B cells. Conclusion: AID is a tightly controlled mutator enzyme, which diversifies immunoglobulin genes upon antigen-encounter of germinal center B cells. The factors that prevent premature expression of AID in pre-germinal center stage B cells were not known. Here, we here we report a novel, IL7R\u03b1/Stat5-dependent mechanism by which pre-B cells are rendered non-responsive to antigen-dependent upregulation of AID. Attenuation of the IL7R\u03b1/Stat5 signal occurs naturally in Fraction D pre-B cells. As a consequence, Fraction D pre-B cells express significant levels of AID for a short time. We propose that Fraction D pre-B cells represent a subset of increased genetic vulnerability in the natural history of childhood ALL. Enlargement of the Fraction D pool or extension of the time window during which pre-B cells are at the Fraction D stage, may increase the risk to acquire secondary genetic lesions towards the development of childhood ALL.
