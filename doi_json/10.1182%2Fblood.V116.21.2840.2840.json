    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2840 Background: The inorganic arsenic, arsenic trioxide (ATO), has a narrow therapeutic index, which has limited its clinical use in most malignancies. Darinaparsin (ZIO-101, S-dimethylarsino-glutathione), synthesized by conjugating dimethylarsenic to glutathione, is a novel organic arsenical that is under investigation as a novel agent for the treatment of cancer. Furthermore, early-phase clinical trials with darinaparsin have demonstrated low toxicity and encouraging clinical efficacy in relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. Methods: We treated several TCL cell lines (Jurkat, C10MJ, Hut-78, and MT2) and the resistant HL cell line, L428, with increasing concentrations of darinaparsin (0.5-5\u03bcM) +/\u2212 the MEK inhibitor, U0126, or ERK siRNA (Qiagen HiPerFect transfection). Cell survival and apoptosis were measured by MTT and Annexin-V/propidium iodide staining, respectively. Further, tumor intracellular darinaparsin and ATO concentrations were assessed with mass spectrometry, while transcription pathway intermediates were analyzed by Western blotting. Results: Darinaparsin inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in all cell lines at 1\u20133\u03bcM. At 2\u03bcm (48 hours), darinaparsin induced approximately 80% apoptosis in each of the four TCL lines, while 3\u03bcM resulted in 65% apoptosis in L428 cells. By comparison, >10\u03bcM of ATO (48 hours) was required to induce 40% apoptosis in TCL and 25% apoptosis in L428. At 1\u20133\u03bcM, darinaparsin induced significant increases in caspase 3 and PARP activation in TCL, while interestingly, minimal caspase or PARP was observed in L428. Notably, in L428 cells at 1 hour, mass spectrometry showed that intracellular accumulation of darinaparsin was >10-fold higher as compared with equivalent ATO concentrations (p<0.01). We also treated L428 cells with U0126 (5\u03bcM) or ERK2 siRNA, both combined with darinaparsin. Pre-incubation with U0126 or siRNA knock down of ERK2, followed by treatment with darinaparsin, significantly enhanced darinaparsin-induced apoptosis (p<0.05). To further investigate darinaparsin-induced signaling pathways, we analyzed phospho-AKT (p-AKT), and phospho-ERK (p-ERK) in Jurkat and L428. We found down-regulation of p-AKT in Jurkat as well as L428 cells, while total AKT remained unchanged. Additionally, an increase in p-ERK was observed in L428 cells with 2\u20133\u03bcM darinaparsin, while p-ERK was down-regulated in Jurkat cells. Conclusions: Darninaparsin induces significant cell death in HL and TCL cell lines that is mediated through AKT and MEK/ERK-based pathways. Additionally, markedly higher intracellular darinaparsin levels are achieved in lymphoma cells compared with equivalent concentrations of ATO. Continued pre-clinical and clinical trial investigation of darinaparsin in HL and TCL is warranted. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
