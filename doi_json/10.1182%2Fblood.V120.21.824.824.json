    "abstract_text": "Abstract 824 DNA methylation is a key element responsible for \u03b3-globin gene repression in adult erythroid cells. Our laboratory previously observed that the \u03b3-globin gene promoter region was demethylated in a progressive manner as \u03b3-globin expression was activated during erythroid differentiation of primary baboon pre-switch fetal liver cells and, to a lesser extent, of adult baboon bone marrow (BM) cells (Singh et al Exp Hematol 35:48-55, 2007). The mechanism responsible for DNA demethylation of the \u03b3-globin promoter during erythroid differentiation remains unknown. Recent studies have shown that DNA demethylation in the early embryo is mediated by the \u201csixth base\u201d 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) whose formation from 5-methylcytosine is catalyzed by the enzymatic activity of the three TET proteins. To investigate the hypothesis that 5-hmC mediates DNA demethylation of the \u03b3-globin promoter during erythroid differentiation, levels of 5-hmC at Msp I (CCGG) sites within the \u03b3- and \u03f5-globin promoters and \u03b3-globin IVS II region in DNA isolated from peripheral WBC, purified terminal erythroid precursors, and FACS-purified adult bone marrow subpopulations enriched for different stages of differentiation (CD117+ CD36-, CD117+ CD36+, and CD117-CD36+), were analyzed using a T4 glucosylase-MspI quantitative real time PCR assay. Levels of 5-hmC associated with the \u03b3-globin promoter MspI site were 11.6 fold higher (p7 fold higher (p<.05) in terminal erythroid precursors compared to the CD117+CD36- subpopulation. These results strongly suggest that differences in 5-hmC associated with the \u03f5- and \u03b3-globin promoters are the result of wider dynamic alterations of genomic 5-hmC levels during erythroid differentiation that may be mediated by differences in TET gene expression and support the hypothesis that 5-hmC is involved in the mechanism responsible for DNA demethylation of the \u03b3-globin promoter during erythroid differentiation.
