Methods: From 2005 to 2009, data regarding pediatric (<18 years) sibling donors undergoing HSC collection from 38 participating EBMT Centers were registered on specific forms sent to the PDWP Office. Data were centrally analyzed as of July 2009. A multiple logistic regression was performed to express an estimate of the relative risk of BM versus PB donation for the following variables: pain, blood transfusion, prolonged hospital stay, and need for iron supplementation. Results: A total number of 410 pediatric sibling donors with median age of 9 (range; 0.3-18) years were enrolled into the study; including 12% aged 4 yrs, OR=9.9, p<0.001), blood allotransfusion (BM collection, OR=22.7, p<0.001; body weight <40 kg, OR=4, p=0.004), prolonged hospital stay (BM collection, OR=3.5, p<0.001), and need for iron supplementation (BM collection, OR=6.9, p<0.001). Conclusions: BM or PB HSC collection in pediatric sibling donors is safe, however there is a risk of mild, short-term and easy to prevent or control early side effects. The risk of SAE in healthy pediatric donors exists, although it is small. Donors and parents must be informed about the risk of possible complication. There is a need of donor outcome and follow-up registry. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
