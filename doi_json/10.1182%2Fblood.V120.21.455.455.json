    "abstract_text": "Abstract 455 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the only curative treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia, and marrow failure states such as myelodysplasia and aplastic anemia. However, allo-HSCT is complicated by allogeneic donor T cell-mediated graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) which can be life-threatening especially in recipients of unrelated or HLA-mismatched hematopoietic stem cell products. These same alloreactive donor T cells also mediate a beneficial graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect. Thus, the clinical goal in allo-HSCT is to minimize GvHD while maintaining GvL. Recent studies have suggested that this might be achieved by infusing regulatory T cells (Tregs) which in some preclinical models suppress GvHD-causing alloreactive donor T cells but have only limited effects on GvL-promoting alloreactive donor T cells. Unfortunately, Tregs exist in low frequency in the peripheral blood, are costly to purify and expand, and after expansion are difficult to isolate due to the lack of cell surface markers, all of which prevent their routine use in the clinic. Thus, alternative therapeutic approaches that do not require Tregs are needed. We have found that interferon gamma receptor deficient (IFN\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212) allogeneic donor T cells induce significantly less GvHD in both a MHC fully-mismatched (B6 (H-2 b ) \u2192 Balb/c (H-2 d )) and a minor-mismatched (B6 (H-2 b ) \u2192 B6\u00d7129(H-2 b )) allo-HSCT models compared to WT T cells. In addition, IFN\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 donor T cells maintain a beneficial GvL effect, which has been examined in both systemic leukemia and solid tumor models using luciferase-expressing A20 cells derived from Balb/c. We find that IFN\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 T cells migrate primarily to the spleen while WT T cells to GI tract and peripheral lymph nodes (LNs) using bioluminescence imaging (BLI), suggesting that altered T cell trafficking of IFN\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 T cells to GvHD target organs might be the major reason for the reduced GvHD. We further demonstrate that the IFN\u03b3R-mediated signaling in alloreactive donor T cells is required for expression of CXCR3 which has been implicated in trafficking of T cells to areas of inflammation and target organs, commonly known to be the sites of GvHD. Indeed, CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 T cells recapitulate the reduced GvHD potential of IFN\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 T cells. In addition, forced overexpression of CXCR3 in IFN\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 T cells via retroviral transduction partially rescues the GvHD defect observed in IFN\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 T cells. We next examine if inhibition of IFN\u03b3R signaling using a small molecule inhibitor can recapitulate the anti-GVHD effects seen in IFN\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 T cells. We find that INCB018424, an inhibitor of JAK1/JAK2 which are the mediators of IFN\u03b3R signaling, blocks CXCR3 expression in vitro. Most importantly, in vivo administration of INCB018424 after allo-HSCT alters T cell trafficking and significantly reduces GvHD. Thus, the IFN\u03b3R signaling pathway represents a promising therapeutic target for future efforts to mitigate GvHD while maintaining GvL after allo-HSCT. Moreover, this pathway can be exploited in other diseases besides GvHD such as those from organ transplantation, chronic inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases.
