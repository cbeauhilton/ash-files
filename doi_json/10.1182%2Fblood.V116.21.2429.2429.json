    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2429 Up to 80% of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) harbour clonal chromosome aberrations having important clinical implications (i.e. 13q deletion, +12, 11q/ ATM and 17p/ TP53 deletions). 14q32/ IGH rearrangements were recently found in 6\u201319% of CLL patients and were associated with therapy-demanding disease and inferior outcome. Whereas evidence was provided that some of the classical aberrations, such as 11q-, 17p-, may appear late in CLL clinical history, no information is presently available concerning 14q32/ IGH translocations. The aim of this study was i) to analyze the incidence of 14q32/ IGH translocations occurring at clonal evolution in CLL, ii) to analyze the clinicobiologic significance of late-appearing 14q32/ IGH translocations. One hundred-five CLL cases seen at our institution in a 10-year period were submitted to FISH analysis at diagnosis or before 1st line treatment as part of routine diagnostic workup. In 47 patients with indolent disease (untreated or treated with 1 line without relapse, group 1) FISH analysis was repeated after 48\u201396 months (median 72). In 58 relapsed patients who started 2nd line treatment (group 2), FISH was performed sequentially before administration of the 2nd line and before each subsequent line of therapy. These 105 patients fulfilled the following criteria: a) diagnosis of bona fide CLL based on morphology and immunophenotyping (CD5/CD19+, CD23+ as minimal requirement), b) clinical records available for review, c) successful FISH analysis at diagnosis and during follow-up. Those cases with t (11;14)(q13;q32)/ CCND1-IGH or other 14q32/ IGH translocations present at diagnosis were excluded from this study. Sequential FISH studies were performed in all patients on peripheral blood (PB) samples using commercially available probes for the identification of deletions at 13q14, 11q22/ ATM , 17p13/ TP53 , of trisomy 12 and of 14q32/ IGH translocations. In 10 patients bone marrow (BM) aspiration and/or lymph node (LN) biopsy were studied by FISH as well. The patients were treated at disease progression as defined by NCI criteria. Refractory disease was defined by stable disease or progressive disease during treatment or disease progression within 6 months of from antileukemic treatment using fludarabine alone or in combination with other agents. Time to chemorefractoriness was measured from date of first line treatment to date of refractoriness to fludarabine containing regimen or date of last follow-up. Overall survival was measured from diagnosis to date of last follow-up or death and from initiation of first line treatment to the date of death or last follow-up. At diagnosis 39% of the cases had 13q-, 14% had +12, 7% had 11q- and 3% had 17p-. A late-appearing 14q32/ IGH rearrangement was not detected among 47 patients in group 1, whereas 7/58 cases (12,1%) in group 2 showed a 14q32/ IGH break in 16\u201325% of the cells. These 7 patients had the following aberrations at diagnosis: 13q- and 11q- in 1 case, 13q- in 2 cases; 11q- in 1 case, +12 in 2 cases, no aberrations 1 case. The 14q32 translocation appeared after a median time of 64 months (range 51\u201391). It was associated with the appearance of 17p- in 3/7 cases with one of these presenting also biallelic del13q. In two cases paired BM or LN sample and PB samples were available for FISH studies and the appearance of IgH translocation in the BM or in the LN sample preceded its appearance in PB by 13\u201358 months. All 7 cases with late appearing 14q32/ IGH translocation developed chemorefractoriness to fludarabine regimen with a median TTC of 27 months (range 12\u201340 months), as compared with a TTC of 67 months (range 1\u2013143 months) in 51 treated patients who did not develop the 14q32 translocation (p=0.0002). Overall survival did not differ significantly either when measured from diagnosis or from 1 st line treatment in 7 patients with 14q32 translocation as compared with the appropriate control. We arrived at the following conclusions: i) a late-appearing 14q32/ IGH translocation occurred at a relatively high incidence (12,1%) in patients with relapsing disease and not in patients with stable disease, ii) this aberration involved a minority of cells and, in approximately half of the cases, it was associated with other aberrations, reflecting complex clonal evolution, iii) in 2 assessable cases it first appeared first in the BM or LN; iv) the appearance of 14q32/IGH translocation was associated with shorter TTC.
