Studies in our laboratory demonstrated elevated levels of IL-17, a pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted by a subset of CD4 + effector T cells (Th17 cells), in the sera of CLL patients as compared to those of healthy age-matched subjects. We hypothesized that the Th17/IL-17 axis is active in CLL, creating a proinflammatory microenvironment that promotes growth and angiogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the expression of both IL-17 and IL-17 receptors in blood, spleen, and lymph nodes of CLL patients and normal control subjects. Methods: All studies involved patients with CLL and healthy subjects matched for age. Constitutive and inducible intracellular IL-17 expression was assessed in cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from untreated CLL patients (n = 27) and healthy individuals (n = 8). Flow cytometric analyses were performed at baseline (Day 0) and after 7-day culture with or without the Th17-polarizing cytokines, IL-1b and IL-23. Surface expression of IL-17 receptors A (IL-17RA) and B (IL-17RB) was analyzed on PBMCs of CLL patients (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 8) using flow cytometry. Lastly, IL-17 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in spleen and lymph nodes from CLL patients and healthy subjects. Results: Intracellular analysis of IL-17 expression in PBMCs revealed a higher median percentage of CD4 + Th17 cells in CLL patients (Median=0.73; range: 0.0-3.6%) compared to healthy subjects (Median=0.13; range: 0.0-0.8%) at baseline; this was a statistically significant difference (P<0.05). While there was no significant difference between the two major patient subgroups, i.e., (Mutated IGHV >2% and CD38 low <30% and unmutated IGHV <2% and CD38 high , >30%). CLL patients in the good prognosis group had significantly higher median percentage of CD4 + IL-17 + cells compared to healthy controls at baseline (Median=0.73 vs 0.13, P<0.05). Complementary studies also revealed that expression of IL-17 in the CD4 + T cell compartment after culturing total PBMC's for 7 days in the absence of Th17-polarizing cytokines was significantly higher in CLL patients than healthy subjects (Median =1.34, P<0.05). When PBMCs were cultured for 7 days in the presence of Th17-polarizing cytokines, the percentage of IL-17-producing CD4 + T cells increased in cells from both patients and healthy subjects, however again the percentage of IL-17 expressing CD4 + cells was higher in cultures of PBMC's from CLL patients as compared to those from healthy subjects (Median= 1.99 vs 0.84). Surface expression of IL-17RA and IL-17RB was observed on monocytes from both patients and healthy subjects. The density of expression of IL-17RA on monocytes was more intense relative to IL-17RB in both patients and healthy subjects; however IL-17RA and IL-17RB expression was not significantly different between patients and healthy subjects with respect to percent of positive cells, mean fluorescence intensity or median fluorescence intensity. Of note, IL-17RA and IL-17RB were expressed on a small fraction of B lymphocytes from patients (Mean for RA and RB= 6.59 and 3.99, respectively) and normal individuals (Mean for RA and RB= 4.31 and 3.43, respectively). For CLL patients, these receptors were detected on CD19 + CD5 + cells, whereas for healthy subjects they were found on CD19 + CD5 \u2212 cells. Preliminary immunohistochemical analyses of lymphoid tissues from CLL patients and healthy subjects revealed strong IL-17 expression in tissues from CLL patients but not in healthy age-matched subjects. Conclusions: Patients with CLL have higher baseline levels of circulating IL-17, as well as increased expression of Th17 cells in the blood and lymphoid tissues, as compared to healthy age-matched subjects. Furthermore, IL-17RA and IL-17RB are expressed on monocytes and on a small population of B cells in CLL patients enabling them to respond to the elevated levels of IL-17 in the microenvironment. Such interactions may stimulate release of pro-survival factors and promote growth and angiogenesis, contributing to the development and evolution of CLL. Further studies are in progress to demonstrate the functional role of IL-17 in CLL. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
