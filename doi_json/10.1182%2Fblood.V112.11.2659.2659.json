    "abstract_text": "Clinical patient observations led to the hypothesis of increased ALL blast resistance in hyperglycemia (HG) states in pediatric ALL patients, either with preexisting diabetes mellitus (DM) or with steroid induced diabetes (SID). To evaluate the above, the chromometric MTT (methyl thiazole tetrazolium) assay was used Kaspers GJ et al, Leuk Res  1995 ; 19 : 175 \u201381 .Ficoll separated nucleated bone marrow cells from newly diagnosed pediatric ALL patients were cultured in usual conditions (NL) and in higher glucose levels (233\u2013295 mg/dl), with the addition of titrated prednisolone (PDN) concentrations. The PDN concentration that lyses 50 % of the cultured blast cells (LD 50 ) is the measure of PDN drug sensitivity. PDN concentrations of 0.02\u20132.0, 2.1\u2013150, above 150 \u03bcg/uL indicate high, intermediate and low blast sensitivity to PDN, respectively. Hence, patient blasts with LD 50 at >150 \u03bcg/uL are resistant to PDN. The MTT assay results have been related to patient outcome (remission induction and event free survival, Pieters R et al Pediatr Oncol  1994 ; 22 : 299 \u2013308 ). Twelve newly diagnosed pediatric patients, with median age 6.4 years (range, 1.7 to 16.5 years) with common/CD10+ (N=8), pre-B (N=2), early pro-B (N=1) and maturing B (N=1) ALL were studied. All patients exhibited >80% ALL blast BM infiltration. Sensitivity (LD 50 < 150 \u03bcg/uL) in both NL and HG conditions was evident for 2 patients, while resistance to both conditions was seen in 3 patients. Patients resistant at NL conditions were resistant in HG, too. In contrast, 7 of 12 patients sensitive to PDN in NL conditions proved resistant in HG conditions (glucose 233\u2013295 mg/dL). All 9 sensitive in NL conditions patients (in HG conditions 2 sensitive and 7 resistant) exhibited a median \u00d7800 fold increase of the MTT LD 50 measured (range 6\u201329.000 fold). For all patients (N=12) median MTT LD 50 under NL conditions was 0.15 \u03bcg/uL and in HG conditions 167.5 \u03bcg/uL (\u00d7 116.6 fold increase). This change was statistically significant (Mc Nemar\u2019s test, p=0,016) and this change was not simply related to the change in glucose concentration. These findings of greatly increased ALL blast resistance in hyperglycemia environment, can support the notions given earlier ( Weiser MA et al, Cancer  2004 ; 100 : 1179 \u201385, Pieter\u2019s R EHA 2008 ) that hyperglycemia by itself can promote PDN resistance. Given that steroids is a mainstay in ALL treatment and that steroid induced hyperglycemia is a common occurrence, blood glucose monitoring and hyperglycemia correction appears to be of paramount significance in delivering an effective ALL treatment.",
