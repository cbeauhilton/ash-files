    "abstract_text": "Cytokine signaling through the tyrosine kinase receptor flt3 and the hematopoietin Interleukin-7-receptor a chain (IL7Ra) is critically involved in regulation of B lymphopoiesis. Specifically, we have recently demonstrated that mice double deficient in flt3 and IL7Ra signaling fail to support B cell commitment and development during embryogenesis as well as in adult hematopietic tissues ( Sitnicka et al, J. Exp. Med ; 198 : 1495 , 2003 ). Previous studies have through generation of IL7Ra knockout mouse on a Bcl-2 transgenic background suggested that IL-7 induced triggering of anti-apoptotic pathways is critically involved in T cell but not B cell development ( Akashi et al, Cell ; 89 : 1033 , 1997 , Kondo et al, Immunity ; 7 : 155 , 1997 ). Thus, we here investigated whether anti-apoptotic signaling might rather be involved in flt3-dependent B cell development, through generation of a H2k driven human Bcl-2 transgenic/Flt3 ligand (FL) \u2212/\u2212 (Bcl-2/FL \u2212/\u2212 ) mice. Strikingly, numbers of Common Lymphoid Progenitors (CLP; lin \u2212 c-kit lo Sca-1 lo IL7Ra + ), pro-B (B220 + CD19 + AA4.1 + CD43 + ), pre-B (B220 + CD43 \u2212 IgM \u2212 ) and mature B cells (B220 + CD43 \u2212 IgM + ) in the BM of 7\u20138 weeks old Bcl-2/FL \u2212/\u2212 mice were all comparable to those observed in wild type mice. More importantly, the pronounced reductions in CLP, pro-B and pre-B progenitors seen in FL \u2212/\u2212 mice on a wild type background were compensated by approximately 50% when FL-deficiency was rather induced on a bcl-2 transgenic background (Bcl-2/FL \u2212/\u2212 ). Thus, in contrast to IL7Ra, the critical role of flt3 in B cell commitment and development might involve triggering of anti-apoptotic pathways.",
