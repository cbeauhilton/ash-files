    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1280 Poster Board I-302 Philadelphia-chromosome negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) including polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are defined as clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders. These disorders show an inherent tendency for transformation into leukemia (MPN-blast phase) which is hypothesized to be accompanied by acquisition of additional genomic lesions. We, therefore, obtained a comprehensive profile of genomic alterations associated with leukemic transformation by using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array in 88 MPN patients, as well as 71 cases with MPN-blast phase, and correlated these findings with their clinical parameters. A relatively high number of genomic alterations was found in MPN after leukemic transformation with 4.6 \u00b1 0.6 abnormalities per sample compared to only 1.4 \u00b1 0.2 changes per patient in chronic phase (p<0.001). Compared to the cytogenetic data, SNP-chip analysis detected about 47% additional chromosomal changes in the MPN samples, and 31% more in the MPN-blast phase cases, whereas SNP-array allelokaryotyping practically captured all cytogenetic abnormalities in our study population. Several additionally altered regions were detected in patients with MPN-blast phase compared to chronic phase, including both deletion and copy-number neutral-loss of heterozygosity (CNN-LOH) on chromosome 12p (9%) and 21q (9%), involving ETV6 and RUNX1 . Notably, deletion and CNN-LOH on 17p involving TP53 were diagnosed in 18% of MPN-blast phase samples, which was highly associated with preceding treatment with alkylating agents (p=0.016). Moreover, trisomy 8, as well as amplification of 8q24.21 involving the MYC gene, were detected in 13% of patients with MPN-blast phase who were almost exclusively negative for the JAK2V617F mutation. Genome-wide inspection of further critical regions with promising new candidate genes involved in the evolution to the MPN-leukemic phase included deletion and CNN-LOH on 7q22.1 ( SH2B2 ) in 18%, duplication/amplification on 19p13.2 ( PIN1 , ICAM1 , CDC37) in 13% and 21q22.2 ( ERG ) in 9% of MPN patients with blast crisis. In contrast, we detected a decreased frequency of JAK2V617F in MPN-blast phase samples (52%) compared to chronic phase (71%). Also, the percentage of patients with homozygous mutant JAK2 as a result of CNN-LOH was lower in the MPN-blast phase (43%) compared to the chronic phase (53%). Taken together, the data suggest that gain-of-function mutation of JAK2 is not a perquisite for leukemic transformation. Remarkably, CNN-LOH on either 7q or 9p was related to decreased survival after leukemic transformation (p=0.02 and p=0.012, respectively). Given the variety of allelic imbalances, our data suggest that MPN-blast phase appears to be a heterogeneous disease prone to have evolved multiple mechanisms to provide a proliferative advantage to the abnormal leukemic clone. Our analysis of MPN genomes in the chronic compared to the leukemic stage provided new prognostic insights, as well as novel causative genes which might be involved in the transformation to MPN-blast phase.
