    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION Steroid-resistant (SR) acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) lacks standard second-line treatment. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have potential efficacy in SR aGVHD. To assess efficacy and safety of MSCs combined with anti-CD25 antibody and calcineurin inhibitors as second-line therapy for SR aGVHD. METHORDS A randomized phase 3 trial involved 203 SR aGVHD patients at 10 centers in China (September 2014-March 2019). Final follow-up was on June 30, 2020. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive second-line therapy (anti-CD25 antibody combined with calcineurin inhibitors) with MSCs (n=101) or without MSCs (n=102). The primary endpoint was overall response (OR) at day 28 with a predefined threshold of -20%. Secondary and safety endpoints included durable OR at day 56, failure-free survival, overall survival (OS), chronic GVHD (cGVHD), infection, haematological toxicity and relapse. RESULTS Of 203 patients, 198 (97.5%; mean age, 30.1years; 40.4% women) completed the study. OR at day 28 was higher in the MSCs group than in the control group (82.8% [82 patients] vs 70.7% [70]; odds ratio, 2.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-3.94; P=.043). Durable OR at day 56 was also higher in the MSCs group (78.8% [78 patients] vs. 64.6% [64]; odds ratio, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.08-3.83; P=.027). The median failure-free survival was longer in the MSCs group compared with control group (11.3 months vs. 6.0 month; hazard ratio (HR) 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48-0.95, P=.024). The 2-year cumulative incidence of cGVHD was 39.5% (95% CI, 29.3%-49.4%) and 62.7% (51.4%-72.1%) in the MSCs and control groups (HR 0\u00b755, 95% CI, 0\u00b736-0\u00b784; P=0\u00b7005). Within 180 days after study treatments, the most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were infections (65 [65.7%] in the MSCs group vs 78 [78.8%] in the control group), haematological toxicity (37 [37.4%] vs 53 [53.5%]). CONCLLUSIONS MSCs plus second-line treatments may increase the efficacy of SR aGVHD, decrease drug toxicity of second-line therapy and cGVHD development, and are well tolerated.
