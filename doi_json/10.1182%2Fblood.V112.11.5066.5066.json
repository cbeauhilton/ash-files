    "abstract_text": "Object: To study the variation of p21, P-gp expression in reversion of multidrug resistance of K562/A02 leukemic line with different concentration of tetrandrine(TET), to provide new theoretic evidence for the clinical application of TET. Methods: The IC50 (the concentration causing 50% inhibition of cell growth) of DNR was analyzed by MTT method; The Expressions of p21 were assayed by westernblot; The Expressions of P-gp were assayed by FCM; The expressions of mdr1 were assayed by RT-PCR; The variation of p21 was accentuation with the accrescence concentration of TET( P <0.05). Results: The variation of p21 protein in K562/A02 cells was accentuation with the accrescence concentration of TET(p<0.05), Mdr1 mRNA was lowly displayed in K562 cells and highly displayed in K562/A02 cells(p<0.01), the variation of mdr1 was attenuation with the accrescence concentration of TET(p<0.05); P-gp was lowly displayed in K562 cells and highly displayed in K562/A02 cells(p<0.01), the variation of P-gp was attenuation with the accrescence concentration of TET(p<0.05). Conclusion: TET may reverse multidrug resistance of K562/A02 cells by the regulation of p21,P-gp and mdr1."
