    "abstract_text": "Introduction: MSC, through a complex crosstalk with neighboring cells/factors, can inhibit many effector functions of immune cells, thereby promoting an immunosuppressive state in the tumor microenvironment. Recently, we demonstrated that MSC derived from Multiple Myeloma patients (MM-MSC) are able to convert normal immature myeloid cells in Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSC), contributing to immune-escape mechanisms. Since it has been demonstrated a connection between the stimulation of specific Toll-like receptors (TLR) and MSC activation status, including two distinct phenotypes defined MSC1 (TLR4-dependent) or MSC2 (TLR3-dependent), we hypothesized that MM-MSC could be activated to better 'serve' the cancer cells. Methods: Peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMC) isolated from healthy subjects (HC) were cultured with healthy controls (HC-), MGUS-, SMM- or MM-MSC . After 6 days, educated neutrophils (ed-N) were isolated using magnetic microbeads. Results: Only ed-N isolated from SMM- and MM-MSC co-cultures showed an activation (N2) phenotype with suppressive effects on T cell proliferation in vitro (p<0.001) and up-regulation of Arg1, NOS2 and TNF\u03b1. Moreover only SMM- and MM-MSC ed-N increased both tube length and number of branch points when co-cultured with Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HBMEC) (p<0.05). Adding Bortezomib, Lenalidomide or Pomalidomide during co-culture, ed-N lost the pro-angiogenic activity but did not lose immunosuppressive ability. Western blotting analysis showed the activation of TLR4/MyD88 pathway in MM-MSC with respect to HC-MSC. To investigate whether TLR signaling could transform healthy MSC in immunosuppressive stromal cells like MM-MSC, we pre-treated HC-MSC with LPS or poly(I:C) as agonists, respectively, for TLR4 and TLR3. After 24 h, HC-MSC were then cultured with HC-PBMC. Only ed-N isolated from co-cultures with HC-MSC pre-treated with LPS showed in vitro N2 phenotype with suppressive effects on T cell proliferation (p<0.001) and pro-angiogenic ability (p<0.05). No effects were observed after TLR3 stimulation. To examine if plasma cells (PC) play a role in MSC polarization, before performing co-cultures with PBMC, we pre-treated HC-MSC with MM cell lines. Plasmacell pre-treatment drives healthy MSC to activate neutrophils in immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic cells. Moreover, MM cell lines were able to activate TLR4 pathway on HC-MSC as observed by western blot analysis. We next investigated in vivo the pro-tumor role of MM-MSC with respect to HC-MSC. After 6 days from implanting of mixtures of fluorescently labeled MM cells and HC- or MM-MSC into immunocompetent zebrafish, animals co-injected with PC and MM-MSC showed enhanced tumor colonization and growth calculated as tumor volume and fluorescence intensity compared with those injected with PC and HC-MSC (p<0.05). Cytofluorimetric analysis confirmed higher localization of human CD138+/CD38+ and human CD90+ cells in the whole kidney marrow of zebrafish (p<0.001). Conclusion : Tumor microenvironment transformation from MGUS to MM is associated with progressive activation of MSC in pro-inflammatory polarized cells which facilitate MM growth in vivo promoting immune-escape mechanisms and angiogenesis. This transformation is at least partially induced by tumor cells themselves, probably through activation of TLR4 pathway on MSC. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
