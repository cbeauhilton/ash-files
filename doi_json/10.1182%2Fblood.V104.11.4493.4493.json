    "abstract_text": "Troglitazone and pioglitazone are one of thiazolidinediones that are high affinity ligand for the nuclear receptor called peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3). Troglitazone is a potent inhibitor of clonogenic growth of acute myeloid leukemia cells when combined with a retinoid. However, the effect of pioglitazone to neoplastic cells and normal hematopoietic cells has not been studied yet. Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), prevalent in western Japan, is a highly aggressive malignancy of mature T lymphocyte. Therefore, we studied antitumor effect of pioglitazone against leukemic cells including ATL as well as normal hematopoietic cells. With 300 \u03bcM of pioglitazone, colony formation of ATL cell lines (MT1, MT2, F6T, OKM3T, and Su9T01) was completely inhibited. Colony formation of HUT102, another ATL cell line, was 12 % compared to untreated control. Clonogenic cells of other leukemic cell lines (K562, HL60, U937, HEL, CEM, and NALM1) was also inhibited to 0\u201330% of control. Colony formation of primary leukemic cells from 5 AML patients was decreased to 15 %. However, normal hematopoietic cells were weakly inhibited with 300 \u03bcM pioglitazone; 77 % of CFU-GM, 70 % of CFU-E, and 33 % of BFU-E survived. Cell cycle analysis showed that pioglitazone decreased the ratio of G2/M phase in HL60 cells, suggesting the inhibition of cell division. By Western blotting, PPAR-\u03b3 protein level was similar in all leukemic cells and normal bone marrow mononuclear cells. Taken together, pioglitazone effectively eliminate leukemic cells and could be used as an antitumor agent in vivo.",
