    "abstract_text": "Background : We recently reported final results of a randomized, open-label, multicenter study assessing the efficacy of DA (Aranesp\u00ae) 300 mcg Q3W (Rearden et al, ASCO 2004). In this study of 201 pts, pts with grade 1 anemia were treated early with DA (n=102; early group) compared with pts treated late after developing grade 2/3 anemia (ie, hemoglobin [Hb] < 10 g/dL; n=99; observation/late intervention group [obs]). When pts were untreated in the obs group, Hb declined. DA treatment maintained Hb within the NCCN Hb target range for pts in the early group and increased Hb once administered in the obs group. The objective of this analysis was to explore the impact of declining Hb levels on pt-reported outcomes using the FACT-Fatigue (FACT-F) subscale. Methods : Pts with baseline (BL) Hb \u226510.5 and \u226412 g/dL were randomized 1:1 to either the early or obs group for up to 22 weeks. To analyze pt-reported fatigue, the FACT-F subscale was administered Q3W and at the end of treatment. The FACT-F analysis set included pts who were randomized, received study drug, and had a BL and at least 1 post-BL FACT-F score. Analyses of changes in FACT-F scores during treatment from BL were conducted; missing values were not imputed. Results : In 201 randomized and treated pts, mean BL (SD) Hb was similar for each group, 11.1 (0.7) g/dL for the early and 11.2 (0.6) g/dL for the obs groups. In the early group, mean Hb increased to near 12 g/dL in approximately 7 weeks, and due to dose-withholding rules, remained near 12 g/dL for the remainder of the study. In the obs group, Hb declined to < 10 g/dL in 65% of pts. The FACT-F analysis set included 94 pts in the early group and 86 in the obs group. Mean (SD) FACT-F scores at BL were 31.6 (11.7) for the early group and 27.7 (12.8) for the obs group. With categories of Hb change at the end of treatment, a significant trend towards greater improvements in fatigue with increasing Hb levels was observed in both groups (table). In pts in whom Hb was stabilized or improved, no decrease in fatigue scores was noted. However, when Hb declined (Hb change < 0 g/dL), a statistically significant and clinically meaningful (>3 point change in FACT-F score) increase in fatigue was observed (negative change in FACT-F score). Consistent with previous studies, pts with Hb change > 2 g/dL had clinically and statistically significant improvements in fatigue. Conclusion: In the absence of treatment, most mildly anemic cancer pts receiving ctx are at risk of developing grade 2/3 anemia within approximately 7 weeks. This decline in Hb is associated with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful increase in pt-reported fatigue. Our results indicate that DA 300 mcg Q3W may effectively ameliorate the impact of ctx on Hb levels and consequently prevent a decline in fatigue. Further, Q3W DA may provide benefits associated with less-frequent dosing. Mean (95%CL) Change in FACT-F Scores At End of Treatment By Change in Hb Category  . Early . Obs .
