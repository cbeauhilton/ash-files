    "abstract_text": "The zinc finger-encoding transacting factor EKLF binds key regulatory elements of many erythroid-specific genes, and is essential for definitive erythropoiesis. Mice lacking this factor (EKLF \u2212/\u2212 ) die of anemia by E15.5 of gestation, failing to activate \u03b2-globin gene transcription, and demonstrating a block in the erythroid differentiation program at the primitive erythroblast stage. In contrast, megakaryocytic progenitors are amplified in EKLFnull embryos, with increased Fli-1 gene expression (a marker of early megakaryocytic differentiation), consistent with the idea that EKLF modulates the megakaryocyticerythroid (M-E) differentiation switch. We have demonstrated that an amino terminal mutant of EKLF (\u0394221EKLF), is required to induce chromatin remodeling at the \u03b2-globin promoter in an EKLF-null erythroid cell line, but additional amino terminal sequences are required for initiation of \u03b2-globin gene transcription (Brown et al., 2002). To evaluate the role of this chromatin remodeling (CR) domain in erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation in vivo , we have generated a knock-in allele of EKLF CR allele. Similar to EKLF-null embryos, mice homozygous for this mutant allele die of anemia by E15.5 of gestation. In contrast to erythroid cells lacking EKLF, EKLF CR/CR progenitors demonstrate appropriate binding of the CR encoding domain to all EKLF-regulatory sequences; a block in erythropoiesis at a more a mature stage in differentiation a chromatin architecture and histone modification pattern at erythroid-specific genes that recapitulates the events observed in EKLF +/+ erythroblasts at a similar stage of erythroid ontogeny; a failure of terminal erythroid gene transcription. Examining the role of EKLF CR in megakaryopoiesis, we observed inhibition of megakaryocytic progenitor amplification in EKLF CR/CR fetal hematopoietic cell populations when compared to EKLF-null embryos; loss of Fli-1 gene expression in EKLF CR expressing cells; binding of the EKLF CR mutant protein to the Fli-1 promoter with inhibition of gene transcription; a repressed chromatin architecture at megakaryocytic gene loci. In contrast to these results, mice homozygous for a knockin allele encoding the zinc finger DNA binding domain alone (\u0394253EKLF), a region shown previously to be sufficient for chromatin remodeling in vitro , demonstrate erythroid and megakaryocytic phenotypes that resemble those observed in EKLF-null hematopoietic progenitors. Taken together, our results suggest strongly that the unique EKLF CR domain is necessary and sufficient to modulate the chromatin-specific roles of EKLF at erythroid- and megakaryocytic-specific loci in definitive hematopoietic cells in vivo .",
