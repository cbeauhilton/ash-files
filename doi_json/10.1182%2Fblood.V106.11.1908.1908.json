    "abstract_text": "The serine/threonine protein kinase AKT [protein kinase B (PKB)] plays a pivotal role in the tumorigenesis of many human malignancies, including hematopoietic neoplasms. AKT mediates cancer cell survival and cell growth through the phosphorylation of key regulatory proteins such as FRKHL-1, MDM2 and p27. We wished to determine whether the AKT signaling pathway might be involved in the pathogenesis of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).The activated form of AKT (pAKT) and phosphorylation of several AKT targets, including FRKHL-1, MDM2 and p27 as well as the upstream modulators PTEN and TCL-1 were analyzed by immunoblotting in 31 MCL cases (16 classic MCL and 15 MCL of the blastoid variant) and in four MCL cell lines (Granta 519, NCEB, REC-1 and Z138). PI3KCA mutation analysis at two hotspot regions (Exons 9 and 20) were completed for all cases and cell lines. Subsequently, inhibition of the PIK3/AKT-pathway with LY294002, Wortmannin and AKT-inhibitor was performed in the four cell lines. pAKT was expressed in all 15 blastoid variants of MCL and in the 4 cell lines, with high expression in 13/15 cases and low expression in 2/15 cases. In contrast, only 2/16 typical MCL expressed pAKT, at low levels. Furthermore, pAKT expression in the blastoid variants and cell lines was accompanied by the phosphorylation of multiple downstream targets of activated AKT, including the cell cycle regulatory proteins p27, FRKHL-1, MDM-2 and the apoptosis associated protein bad. 42% of the blastoid MCL cases showed loss of PTEN, while only 2 (12%) of the typical cases showed diminished PTEN expression.TCL-1 expression levels were not correlated with AKT activation and no mutations of PI3KCA were detected. Functional studies of all four MCL lines demonstrated that the phosphorylation of the downstream effectors were regulated by activated AKT:Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway by both 20 \u03bcM LY294002 and 8 \u03bcM Wortmannin or 40 \u03bcM AKT-inhibitor abrogated the phosphorylation of AKT, p27, FRKHL-1, bad and MDM2 after 24 to 48 hours of treatment, and resulted in G 1 arrest after 24 hours of treatment and measurable apoptosis by 48 hours. We conclude that constitutive activation of AKT contributes to the pathogenesis of the blastoid variants of MCL. One possible mechanism of AKT activation is the loss of PTEN expression. The inhibition of the PIK3/AKT pathway in MCL cell lines leads to induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, raising the possibility that PI3K/AKT inhibitors may be effective in the treatment of aggressive (blastoid) variants of MCLs."
