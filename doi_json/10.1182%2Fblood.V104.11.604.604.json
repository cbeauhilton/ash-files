    "abstract_text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infects approximately 40% of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HCV/HIV co-infected patients often have progressive liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis and death. We observed that hepatocytes exposed to HCV and HIV envelope proteins undergo apoptosis via an \u2018innocent bystander\u2019 mechanism due to cell surface binding of viral proteins independent of direct viral infection. HCV envelope protein E2 (1.5 nM) and HIV envelope protein gp120 (0.8 nM) derived from M-tropic and T-tropic viruses induce significant apoptosis in both hepatocytic cell lines and primary hepatocytes, while either of these viral proteins alone does not. Now, we have elucidated the signaling mechanisms that mediate this effect. HCV-E2 and HIV-gp120 were found to significantly upregulate Fas ligand (FasL). We then examined the Stat family of proteins known to participate in FasL and apoptotic pathways. We observed an increased DNA binding activity of Stat1 upon HCV-E2 and HIV-gp120 stimulation. Furthermore, overexpression of wild type Stat1\u03b1increased apoptosis and FasL expression in HepG2 cells, whereas a C-terminal domain deleted mutant, Stat1\u03b2, decreased HCV-E2 and HIV-gp120 mediated apoptosis and FasL upregulation. Overexpression of Stat1\u03b1and Stat1\u03b2 in primary hepatocytes confirmed that Stat1\u03b1enhanced apoptosis upon HCV-E2 and HIV-gp120 treatment. We observed a tyrosine dependent activation of Stat1 and a subsequent serine phosphorylation of Stat1. TYK2, lyn kinase, RAFTK and MAP kinases were activated upstream of Stat1. In addition, Stat1 associated with the death domain-containing adapter protein TRADD. TRADD is known to induce inflammatory signaling through the NF\u03baB pathway. Here, the association of Stat1 with TRADD would reduce the availability of TRADD to induce NF\u03baB. Thus, Stat1 sequestration of downstream apoptotic signaling molecules would block the host inflammatory response. Further characterization of Fas-mediated apoptosis revealed that caspase 3 and caspase 7 were activated following HCV-E2 and HIV-gp120 stimulation. However, we were not able to detect significant activity of either caspase 8 or caspase 9. We also found a loss in mitochondrial membrane potential upon HCV-E2 and HIV-gp120 stimulation, which leads to the release of cytochrome C and AIF into the cytosol. Taken together, these studies indicate that the viral proteins of HCV and HIV co-operate in causing the apoptosis of hepatocytes, independent of direct infection, by induction of novel Stat1 downstream signaling pathways at the expense of a normal host inflammatory response.",
