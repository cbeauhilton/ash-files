    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4730 Background The DNA-based immunomodulator MGN1703 stimulates the innate and cellular immune system mainly via the TLR9-receptor. The results of the recent in vivo experiments showed potent anti-tumor efficacy of MGN1703 in several mouse tumor models in prophylactic and therapeutic settings as well as a good safety profile in various animals. Two investigator-initiated pilot trials of MGN1703 as adjuvant in patients with metastatic solid tumors also showed good safety and tolerability of the drug as well as a positive effect on the response rate in patients treated with MGN1703. Patients/Methods In this Phase 1 clinical trial MGN1703 is administered subcutaneously in escalating doses (0.25 mg, 2 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg; 3-6 patients per group) either in a single or in a multiple (2x / week over 6 weeks) dose regimen. Patients with metastatic tumors of the following entities are recruited for the study, if no other standard treatment options are available: Colorectal cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Primary endpoints are evaluation of the safety and tolerability of escalating single doses and of escalating multiple doses of s.c. administered MGN1703, determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT), and recommendation of a dose for a Phase 2 trial in patients. Results Currently, 12 patients have been treated and evaluated in the single dose groups of 0.25 mg, 2 mg, 10 mg and 30 mg (3 patients each). In the multiple dose group, 4 patients have been treated with 0.25 mg, 3 patients with 2 mg, 3 patients with 10 mg and 3 patients with 30 mg MGN1703, so far. Therapy was well tolerated except for sporadic transient symptoms as mild redness and induration of injection sites in two patients, increase of temperature to 38 \u00b0C in one patient, and fatigue in two patients. In the 0.25 mg group, one patient showed a stable disease (SD, according to RECIST) after 6 weeks of treatment, and in the 2 mg group, 3 of 3 patients showed a SD after 6 weeks. Treatment results of the last 2 dosing groups are pending. The four patients, who responded to the treatment with MGN1703, were treated with MGN1703 for further 6 weeks within an extension phase of this clinical trial. Two of them still had a SD after 12 weeks of treatment. Conclusions MGN1703 showed safety and tolerability at dosages up to 30 mg so far. The detailed evaluation of clinical and immunological responses is still ongoing. There has been no DLT at this point of the Phase 1 trial.
