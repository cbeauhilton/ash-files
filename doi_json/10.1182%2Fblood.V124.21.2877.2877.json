    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Direct oral anticoagulants, previously new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) had a favorable risk\u2013benefit profile, both for stroke prevention or systemic embolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), or for venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment. Although the rate of intracranial hemorrhage is lower, the risk for major bleeding is similar as for warfarin. Only few data are available for the management of major bleeding in clinical practice. The aim of this study is to present preliminary results regarding characterization and care of major bleeding through a French prospective registry. Methods: The GIHP (French Working group on Perioperative hemostasis) \u2013 NACO registry is a prospective observatory started in June 2013 in 32 emergency centers in France and Belgium. Only patients treated by NOACs and hospitalized for major bleeding or urgent surgery were registered. Results: In a midterm analysis in June 2014, 339 patients were included, among which 219 for major bleeding. 75 patients were treated by dabigatran (150 mg bid: 81%), and 142 by rivaroxaban (20 mg od: 54%) (2 patients were treated by Apixaban). The mean age was 76.4 +/- 11y, and mean BMI 26.3. Creatinine clearance was lower than 60 ml/min in 65%. Patients were treated for atrial fibrillation (80%) or VTE (20%). Among patients with AF, 67.2% had CHADS2 at 2 or less. 61.6% of patients received concomitantly at least one drug interfering with CYP or Pgp, and 26.9% received another antithrombotic drug at the time of bleeding. Major hemorrhagic sites were gastrointestinal (25%) and intracranial, either spontaneous (20%) or post-trauma (15%). AOD concentrations were determined in 46% of patients. 20% of the patients with major bleeding had a plasma concentration less than 50 ng/ml. As expected, there is no relationship between drug concentrations and standard hemostatic tests such as PT and aPTT. 38.4% of patients received PCC or aPCC, and 25.7% benefited for any additional procedures (surgery, endoscopy, embolization\u2026). 42.2% of bleeding completely stopped after the administration of clotting factors. At 30d of follow up, 9.1% of patients presented a cardiovascular event, and all-cause mortality was 14.2%. Conclusion: This midterm analysis of the GIHP NACO registry shows consistent results with phase III studies, with some particularities compared to clinical trials, especially in the use of PCC. The registry allows the analysis of specific population such as trauma patients and highlights the care of such major hemorrhages.
