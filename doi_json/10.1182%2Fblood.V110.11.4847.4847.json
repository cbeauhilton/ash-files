    "abstract_text": "Background: Renal impairment occurs in up to 30% of patients who present with multiple myeloma and in up tp 50% of patients at some stage of the illness. It is known that renal impairment can be reversed in a significant number of such patients by correction of precipitating factors and rehydration but that 3\u201312% patients will require dialysis or other major intervention. These patient have a worse prognosis largely due to an excess of early deaths, renal failure being the major cause of death in 14% of myeloma patients and contributing factor in a further 14%. (Drayson et al UK MRC MM trials 1980\u20132002) We have conducted a study to look into the clinical course and outcome of all patients with renal impairment sufficiently severe to be referred to the regional renal unit in South East England between 2000 and 2007 with either newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) or relapsed disease to try to identify features which predict for better outcomes. Methods: 62 patients with MM and renal failure received treatment in our hospital over the last 8 years. Patients have been assessed for recovery of renal function and dialysis independence in two groups - newly diagnosed (n=47) and relapsed patients (n=15). They were analysed separately as the disease tends to be biologically different at presentation and relapse, and therapeutic options may be different. In addition relatively little data on relapsed myeloma with renal failure is available. Results: 14 patients in the newly diagnosed group and 4 in the relapsed group were deemed unsuitable for an active treatment approach and have been excluded from statistical analysis in this paper but will be analysed separately to try to identify factors which could improve the outcome for this group. The patients with newly diagnosed MM and actively treated had a mean age of 65.3\u00b11.7 years (range 41.9\u201383.3), male to female ratio of 1.7:1 and a mean peak creatinine at presentation of 684.5\u00b160.9 mmol/l (range 107\u20131820). Light chain myeloma was overrepresented and was seen in 57.5% of patients (n=19). 12 (36.3%) of 33 the new patients avoided dialysis. 21 required dialysis, of whom 8 patients (38.1%) recovered function to dialysis independence at 6 months. There were only 3 deaths at 6 months follow-up. The mean age of the relapsed patients was 61.8\u00b13.5 years (range 34.9\u201380.7), male to female ratio of 2.6:1 and a mean peak creatinine at presentation of 824\u00b1118.4 mmol/l (range 231\u20131591). Majority of myeloma was IgA in 36.3% (n = 4). Among the 11 relapsed, 82% (n=9) required dialysis but a significant proportion, 88% (n=8), were dialysis independent at 6 months There was only one death within 6 months of a relapse. Treatments in the 2 groups varied but involved the use of regimes containing high dose steroids in most patients. Conclusions: Our data suggest that renal failure and dialysis dependence can be avoided or is reversible in a large number of newly diagnosed and relapsed myeloma patients. This study of an unselected group of patients receiving current therapy provides an important baseline against which to compare the effect of approaches involving the newer biological agents."
