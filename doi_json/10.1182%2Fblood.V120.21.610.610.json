    "abstract_text": "Abstract 610 Introduction: Iron has crucial roles in many cellular biological processes. Cellular iron uptake and export must be tightly regulated. Insufficient iron concentrations impair the function of numerous iron proteins, whereas excess free iron can oxidize and damage the contents of cells. Anamorsin (AM, also called CIAPIN-1) is an anti-apoptotic factor, which we originally isolated as a molecule that confers factor-independent survival of hematopoietic cells. AM-deficient mice are embryonic lethal at late gestation due to the defect of definitive hematopoiesis. It is thought that AM plays a crucial role in hematopoiesis, however its precise biological mechanisms remain unclear. Recently, it was reported that the yeast AM homolog, Dre2, was implicated in cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cluster assembly (Zhang Y., et al. Mol.Cell.Biol. 28:5569\u20135582, 2008). The AM carries conserved cysteine motifs (CX2CXC and twin CX2C) at its C termini, which may form iron binding sites. In this study, we have focused on the possibility that AM may be involved in the maturation of Fe/S cluster and the cellular iron homeostasis, especially, the regulation of labile iron pool (LIP) and that AM may affect the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to impaired erythropoiesis. Methods and Results: To analyze the function of Fe/S protein, we established wild-type cell lines (AMWT) and AM-deficient cell lines (AMKO) from wild-type and AM-deficient fetal liver (14.5dpc) respectively by using SV40 large T antigen. Iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) is a well-known Fe/S protein with dual functions. In the presence of Fe/S cluster, IRP1 functions as a cytosolic aconitase. While, in the absence of Fe/S cluster, IRP1 stabilizes the transferrin receptor (TfR) mRNA by binding to the iron responsive element (IRE). We compared the aconitase activity and the IRE binding activity of IRP1 between AMWT and AMKO. The results showed that the cytosolic aconitase activity in AMKO decreased approximately 30% compared to AMWT and the IRE binding activity of IRP1 in AMKO increased 3-fold compared to AMWT. Furthermore, we compared the iron homeostasis. In the presence of iron chelator, desferrioxamine, the expression of TfR in AMWT was markedly elevated, while it was hardly elevated in AMKO. The LIP is a pool of chelatable and redox-active iron, which serves as a crossroad of cell iron metabolism. The measurement of LIP with the metal-sensitive sensor calcein acetoxymethyl ester showed that AMKO had 5-fold higher cellular LIP than AMWT. Moreover we evaluated the accumulation of ROS and the induction of apoptosis by extracellular iron uptake between AMWT and AMKO. The results showed the accumulation of ROS and the induction of apoptosis in AMKO were enhanced about twice as much as in AMWT. These enhancements could be restored by transduction of AM expressing retrovirus vector to AMKO. We also evaluated the effects of AM-deficiency on erythroid differentiation. Fetal liver cells from wild-type or AM-deficient embryos (14.5dpc) were divided into primitive and more matured erythroid populations based on their expression of CD71 and Ter119 by FACS analysis. AM-deficient fetal liver cells had a significant increase in the CD71 low TER119 low population, containing primitive erythroid progenitors, compared to wild-type (9.4\u00b12.1% vs. 5.2\u00b11.1%, P<0.05). Conversely, the CD71 low TER119 high population, comprised of late orthochromatophilic erythroblasts and reticulocytes, decreased in AM-deficient fetal liver cells compared to wild-type cells (2.3\u00b10.8% vs. 7.4\u00b11.3%, P < 0.05). Moreover we studied LIP in wild-type or AM-deficient embryo fetal liver cells. In accordance with the cell lines, the LIP in AM-deficient fetal liver cells increased 3 to 5-fold more than in wild-type fetal liver cells. The accumulation of ROS and the number of apoptotic cells also increased 2 to 5-fold in AM- deficient fetal liver cells compared to wild-type fetal liver cells. Thus, it was showed that AM deficiency impaired the iron homeostasis and conferred low sensitivity for iron concentration, resulting in the increase of LIP, the accumulation of ROS and the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, dysregulation of cellular iron homeostasis was thought to be the cause of the embryonic lethal due to AM deficiency. Conclusion: Our current findings indicate that AM functions in cytosolic Fe/S cluster biogenesis and iron homeostasis and is essential for erythropoiesis. Disclosures: Kanakura: Shire: Consultancy.",
