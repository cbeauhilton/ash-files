    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3669 Background: Relapsed/refractory PTCL and NKL after conventional chemotherapy carry a poor prognosis and there is currently no proven salvage treatment available. Numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated synergistic interactions between proteasome and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Inhibition of HDAC6 by PAN abrogates BTZ-induced protective aggreosome formation and accentuates BTZ induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, leading to further apoptosis. Primary end point of this ongoing phase II multi-center open-label clinical study ( NCT00901147 ) is the objective response rate (ORR) according to the Revised Response Criteria (2007) among eligible patients (pts) treated with this novel combination of BTZ and PAN. Secondary end points include the evaluation of the progression-free survival (PFS) and the assessment of the safety and tolerability of the combination. Methods: Pts with histologically confirmed PTCL or NKL who failed or were refractory to 1 prior systemic therapy, and had measurable disease and ECOG performance status 0\u20132 were eligible. Pts were accrued according to a 2-stage Gehan design. Pts receive thrice weekly oral PAN (20 mg) and twice weekly BTZ (IV 1.3 mg/m 2 ), both for 2 of 3 weeks for up to 8 cycles. Preliminary response data were available for all 11 pts recruited for stage 1 of the study. A response rate of >25% will allow the study to proceed to stage 2. Results: Among pts enrolled, histologies included: angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) n=4, PTCL (unspecified) n=4, ALK+ Anaplastic large cell lymphoma n=1 and NKL, nasal type n=2. The median age was 52 (35\u201372) years, and 70% were male. The ORR was 54.5% with 18% attaining a complete response. Four pts (36%) had a partial response, and stable disease was noted in 2 (18%). Pts received a median of 2 prior therapies (range 1\u20133); 27% received an autogous stem cell transplantation (SCT). Common treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events included thrombocytopenia (36%), neutropenia (27%), diarrhoea (18%) and fatigue (9%). Peripheral neuropathy of any grade was observed in 35%. Among pts who responded or had stable disease, the median PFS was 6 months and disease progression occurred at a median of 2.5 months after stopping trial drugs. Two deaths have occurred: 1 due to progressive disease and 1 associated with an unrelated cardiac event. 3 pts successfully underwent subsequent allogeneic SCT. Conclusions: The study regimen shows activity across T/NK-cell lymphomas and ORR greatly exceeds the predefined threshold of 25% allowing, together with early tolerability data, continuation of study enrolment in stage 2. The early progression of the disease after stopping trial drugs albeit the high initial ORR suggests that the novel combination provides a tonic suppression of tumor proliferation and ongoing treatment will be beneficial for pts without option for subsequent alternative treatment like SCT. An extended phase of maintenance treatment will be incorporated into stage 2 of the study to allow pts to optimally benefit from the combination. Our interim findings may have implications on the design of future studies seeking proteasome and HDAC inhibition in PTCL or NKL. Ongoing correlative studies are designed to determine if the study regimen is more active in diseases with up-regulation of NF-kappa B activity or transcription factors/co-regulators known to be modified by acetylation.
