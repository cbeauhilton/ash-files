    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2845 Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent that has both direct tumoricidal and immunomodulatory activities which are critical for its clinical activity in the treatment of various hematologic malignancies. This activity is at least in part mediated by enhanced T-cell and NK-cell effector function to eliminate tumor B cells, attributed to restoration of impaired T-cell activity and formation of immunologic synapses. Rituximab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that is active in the treatment of B-cell lymphomas through a variety of mechanisms, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Preclinical studies and early clinical trials have shown an enhancement, and potentially synergy, in antitumor activity when lenalidomide is combined with rituximab. In order to further explore the mechanistic basis of this enhancement we investigated the impact of lenalidomide and rituximab on immune synapse formation and ADCC. We have previously shown that the combined use of lenalidomide and rituximab enhances NK cell-mediated immune synapse formation and the resultant cytotoxicity, versus each agent alone. Here we evaluate the molecular events that take place on the cell surface upon exposure of JeKo-1 cells (mantle cell lymphoma) and primary B-CLL cells to lenalidomide alone or lenalidomide plus rituximab. Change in CD20 expression resulting from exposure to vehicle control (0.1% DMSO) or 1 \u03bcM lenalidomide for 30 min or 24, 48, 72 hrs was assessed using immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry and isolation of cell membrane-associated proteins followed by Western blotting. At all time points evaluated, levels of cell surface and cell membrane-associated CD20 expression were unchanged in JeKo-1 cells. However, the distribution of CD20 was dramatically altered within 30 minutes after addition of lenalidomide. CD20 redistribution was accompanied by F-actin polymerization and lipid raft aggregation associated with the polarized localization (capping) of a number of proteins including CD20, CD19 and cytoskeleton signaling molecules Rac1 and Vav1, critical regulators of immune synapse formation in effector cells. Of note, other surface proteins involved in signaling such as CD45 were not part of this capping mechanism. By 48 hours of lenalidomide treatment, the majority of JeKo-1 cells (>80%) showed continued capping of CD20. These responses were also seen in primary B-CLL cells, although the effects were variable. In addition, CD20, F-actin and lipid rafts co-localized at the immune synapses formed between JeKo-1 and NK cells treated with either 1 \u03bcM lenalidomide for 24 hrs, 0.1% DMSO for 24 hrs followed by 10 \u03bcg/ml rituximab for 30 min, or treated sequentially with 1\u03bcM lenalidomide for 24 hrs followed by 10 ug/ml rituximab for 30 min. Lenalidomide and rituximab induced similar effects on B-CLL cells and the immune synapses formed between B-CLL and NK cells. We also determined whether formation of lipid rafts and actin cytoskeleton modifications were a prerequisite for CD20 capping. Cholesterol extraction from JeKo-1cells by 5 mM methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (MCD) treatment for 30 min led to complete abrogation of lenalidomide-induced capping. The polymerization of the F-actin cytoskeleton and capping of CD20 was also affected, with no impact on cell viability. In addition, MCD treatment inhibited the formation of immunologic synapses between JeKo-1 cells and NK cells treated with 1 \u03bcM lenalidomide alone and in cells co-treated with 1 \u03bcM lenalidomide and 10 \u03bcg/ml rituximab. These data are consistent with a requirement for the integrity of lipid rafts to maintain the capping of CD20 and to potentially mediate lenalidomide enhancement of ADCC by rituximab. Our results further demonstrate that lenalidomide does not down-regulate CD20, but rather induces its polarized localization at the cell surface. The capping of CD20 is accompanied by redistribution of proteins such as Vav1 and Rac1 that become part of the immune synapse complex. Therefore the capping process induced by lenalidomide appears integral to immune synapse formation and may coordinately enhance the clustering of both the CD20 antigen and the attached rituximab, potentially further enhancing its activity, which would support the clinical combination of these agents. Ongoing studies are currently examining the role of the capping process and intracellular signaling cascades in the direct tumoricidal activity of lenalidomide.
