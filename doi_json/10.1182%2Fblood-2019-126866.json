    "abstract_text": "Monosomy (-7) and deletions of the long arm of chromosome 7 (del7q) are frequently found in patients with myeloid neoplasms, suggesting a crucial role of this region in disease pathogenicity. -7/del7q conveys a poor prognosis and no targeted therapies exist for patients harboring this defect. We previously characterized the most common deleted regions (CDR) of del7q, including 7q22, 7q34, and 7q35-36, as well as micro deletions on del7q indicative of pathogenic genes. Unlike del5q, -7/del7q is affected both by deletions and somatic UPD, suggesting that loss of heterozygosity (LOH), rather than or in addition to haploinsufficient (HI) gene expression, may play a pathogenic role. Previous studies identified possible driver genes contributing to the pathogenesis of -7/del7q including CUX1 , EZH2 , LUC7L2 , MLL3 , and SAMD9 / 9L . Some of these genes may be affected by somatic mutations in hemizygous ( LUC7L2 ), or homozygous ( EZH2 ) configurations while others are affected by germ line (GL) mutations wherein a disease-prone allele is eliminated upon somatic acquisition of -7/del7q. The pathogenic mechanisms driving evolution of -7/del7q neoplasms, though, have not been clarified and specific therapies similar to lenalidomide in del5q have not been developed yet. The outstanding open questions include: i) the rank of -7/del7q in the clonal hierarchy; ii) genetic predispositions to -7/del7q; iii) new important genes affected by LOH or HI; iv) genetic differences between -7 and del7q; and v) co-associated somatic hits. We performed a complex molecular analysis of -7/del7q patients (N=316) using NGS: 67% with -7 (211/316) and 33% with del7q (105/316). First we performed analyses of clonal architecture using an allelic imbalance pipeline which facilitated reconstruction of clonal hierarchy. In 58% of patients -7/del7q was an ancestral lesion, while in 42% it was preceded by somatic hits such as TP53 (60%), IDH1/2 (30%), and DNMT3A (20%). The frequency of a chr7 abnormality as ancestral vs . secondary was no different in -7 vs . del7q. We then studied somatic hits associated with -7/del7q. The most commonly mutated genes were TP53 (43%), TET2 (17%), DNMT3A (15%), and ASXL1 (11%) and the most frequent additional lesion was del5q (30%). About 40% of -7 and 58% of del7q occurred in the context of complex karyotype (CK). We then compared various clinical and mutational features of patients with -7 vs. del7q: -7 was significantly associated with +8 (p=.002), while del7q was associated with CK (p=.004). Isolated -7/del7q was associated with mutations in TET2 (35% vs. 10%, p<.001), DNMT3A (23% vs . 11%, p=.03), ASXL1 (18% vs . 4%, p<.001), and SETBP1 (18% vs . 3%, p<.001). -7/del7q in a CK was strongly associated with a worse prognosis (p=.003) and TP53 mutations (66% vs. 6% isolated -7/del7q, p<.001). Focusing on genes located on chr7, hemizygous mutations were found in CUX1 (2% vs . 4% heterozygous, het), EZH2 (5% vs . 5% het), and LUC7L2 (2% vs . 0.4% het). Mutated genes on -7/del7 not previously described as being associated with MDS included SDK1 (n=13), and CD36 (n=13), among others. Among our patients, 2% harbored SAMD9 / 9L and <1% heterozygous Fanconi Anemia Tier 1 GL mutations. RNA-seq was used to identify HI genes in the CDR. We defined HI expression of a gene in a given patient as having expression < 25 th percentile of diploid MDS patients. Based on this criterion, 60% of genes were HI in at least half of the patients. Of known -7/del7q genes, we confirmed HI in CUX1 (79%), EZH2 (83%), LUC7L2 (63%), MLL3 (76%), SAMD9 / 9L (34% / 53%) among -7/del7q. Expression of AQP1 , KEL , and KCNH2 fulfilled the working definition of HI in diploid cases. Out of all 358 (100%) HI genes, 75% were HI in 63%, 50% in 73%, and 25% in 89% of -7/del7q patients, a diversity that could contribute to clinical heterogeneity. We also identified genes not previously reported to be HI, including PSM2 (97%), MDH2 (92%), SSBP1 (92%), and CUL1 (91%) on 7q and SNX10 (100%) and IKZF1 (96%) on 7p. In sum, we showed the clonal hierarchy of -7/del7q and identified a number of genes that were previously not reported to be HI in -7/del7q patients. We are evaluating expression patterns to establish a minimal expression signature of -7/del7q. Further investigation of these genes could reveal their pathogenesis in myeloid disease. Other contributions from our group ( V Adema et al, ASH2019 ) include implication of IKZF1 and CUL1 as potential drug targets in -7/del7q.
