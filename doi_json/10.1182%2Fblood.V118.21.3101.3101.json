    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3101 The POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, skin changes) syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic disorder secondary to a clonal plasma cell process. The most experience with successful outcomes in POEMS with disseminated disease has been with high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). However, the risk of relapse of POEMS following an ASCT or the outcome of the patients who relapse is not known. We therefore performed a retrospective review of POEMS patients who underwent ASCT at our center and subsequently relapsed or progressed. Over the past 12 years, 58 patients with POEMS underwent autologous stem cell transplantation at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester between Mar 18, 1999 and Jun 22, 2011. With a median follow up of 40 months (1\u2013147 months), 12 patients have relapsed. The median time to relapse was 41 months. The 1, 2, and 5 year PFS rates were 98%, 94%, and 75%, respectively ( Figure 1 ), and the 1, 2, and 5 year OS rates were 98%, 98%, and 94%.

By 1 year, the FDG avidity had not resolved in 4 of these patients who then went on to either develop additional lesions or increasing SUV of existing lesions. Of the 12 patients with documented relapse, 8 had baseline VEGF measurements, and all but 1 had normalization by 1 year. The first sign of relapse was a clinical deterioration in 2, a rising M-protein in 3, and a rising plasma VEGF level in 5 patients. All of these patients had new or worsening of existing lesions on PET/CT scan (n= 9) or x-ray imaging (n= 3). The symptoms of clinical relapse included pain at the site of the lytic lesion and generalized pain with swelling. Of the patients who relapsed, 5 were treated with radiation therapy, 4 received lenalidomide or thalidomide, 2 had alkylator based therapy and 1 had bortezomib based therapy. One patient was treated with surgical resection of his hepatic plasmacytoma and 2 patients have been observed without needing definitive treatment as of yet. One patient also received anti-VEGF treatment with bevacizumab unsuccessfully after failing cyclophosphamide therapy. In this large cohort of POEMS patients treated with high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation in a single center, a relapse rate of 21% was noted. Not every patient who relapsed has been deemed to need further treatment, and most patients could be salvaged with chemotherapy or radiation. Only one patient died from relapsed POEMS following stem cell transplantation. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
