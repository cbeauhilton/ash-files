    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4183 The oncogenic NRAS mutations are frequently identified in myeloid diseases but rare in lymphoid diseases. They occur in 4% of acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) patients and 22% of human T-ALL cell lines. Its differential roles in myeloid versus lymphoid disease development remain unclear. Here we examine the tumorigenic potential of oncogenic Nras in T-cells using two conditional Nras G12D murine knock-in models that either hypomorphically (Nras G12D Hypo ) or normally (Nras G12D Norm ) expresses oncogenic Nras G12D from its endogenous locus. Mice expressing monoallelic or biallelic Nras G12D Hypo develop normally and are tumor free. However, Nras G12D Norm leads to acute T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (TAL/L) in a bone marrow transplantation model, with a low incidence (\u223c8%) when expressing one allele (TAL/L-het) and a complete penetrance when expressing two alleles (TAL/L-homo). TAL/L-het tumors are associated with spontaneous up-regulation of oncogenic Nras in \u223c67% of animals, and tumor cells are TdT positive, suggesting that they are transformed at an immature stage. In contrast, TAL/L-homo tumors express comparable levels of Nras to control thymocytes, and tumor cells are TdT negative, suggesting that they are transformed at a more mature stage. Both TAL/L-het and TAL/L-homo tumors are oligoclonal or polyclonal. Above 70% of these tumors contain clonal Notch1 mutations and are sensitive to gamma-secretase inhibitor. These data indicate that Notch1 mutations are acquired at an early stage and play an important role in the development of TAL/L-het and TAL/L-homo tumors. Together, our results show that engdogenous oncogenic Nras mutation leads to TAL/L in a dose-dependent manner, and thus explain the low incidence of oncogenic NRAS mutations in human T-cell diseases.
