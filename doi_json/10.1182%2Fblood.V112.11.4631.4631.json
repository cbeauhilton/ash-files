    "abstract_text": "The adoptive immunotherapy of antigen specific T cell receptor (TCR)-modified T cells is considered as a new and promising treatment. Recently, successful transfer TCR genes specific for a variety of virus-specific and tumor-associated antigens, such as MART-1/WT1 TCR-modified T cells were showed the specific cytotoxicity on melanoma or leukemia cells. Little is known the TCR gene-modified T cells specific for lymphomaassociated antigen. Our previous study have found some TCR gene sequences associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphomas ( DLBL ) and had submitted them to GenBank (Accession numbers: EU369627 ,EU368854). In the present study, we used different approaches to construct different recombinant plasmids containing the TCRV\u03b16- and TCRV\u03b213-chain genes specific for DLBL-associated antigen and to transfect both K293 and Molt-4 cell line. TCRV\u03b16- and V\u03b213-chain genes were either introduced into two individual eukaryotic expression vectors (TCRV\u03b16+TCRV\u03b213), or introduced into one eukaryotic expression vector in which the TCRV\u03b16- and V\u03b213-chain genes linked by an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). As it is known that the gene inserted downstream to the IRES is expressed at significantly lower levels than the gene introduced into the upstream position, and the two chains maybe play nonequivalent roles in antigen selection by extensive kinetic and structural analyses, we integrated TCR\u03b1 either into the IRES 5\u2032 position (TCRV\u03b16-IRES-V\u03b213) or the 3\u2032 position (TCRV\u03b213-IRES-V\u03b16), and generated two kinds of recombinant plasmids. Subsequently their sequences were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion analysis and sequencing. Then K293 cells (a TCR-deficient cell line) and Molt-4 cells (a TCR V\u03b22 -bearing cell line) were transfected with the respective TCR-encoding expression plasmids using Lipofectamine \u2122 2000. The mRNA expression of TCR V\u03b16- and V\u03b213- chain genes were detected by RT-PCR and real-time PCR. In K293 cells, all recombinant plasmids expressed equally well TCRV\u03b16- and V\u03b213- chain genes by Laser Confocal Microscopy (LCM) and the transfection efficiency was about 80% at 72 h after transfection, while transfection efficiency (20%) in a TCR-bearing cell line was lowered than that in the TCR-deficient cell; And the mRNA expression of TCRV\u03b16- and V\u03b213-chain genes in K293 cells was superior to that in Molt-4 cells as shown by real-time PCR. The results suggested that the transferred TCR maybe have to compete with endogenous TCR chains in a TCR-bearing cell line. However, there are no difference of transduction efficiency among three kinds of transfer modes and no significant differences in the mRNA expression of both TCR V\u03b16 and V\u03b213 genes by realtime PCR detection. In conclusions, three kinds of eukaryotic expression plasmids of TCR V\u03b16-IRES-V\u03b213, TCR V\u03b213-IRES-V\u03b16 and TCR V\u03b16+V\u03b213 specific for DLBL were constructed successfully in this study and could express well in vitro after transfecting both K293 cells and Molt-4 cells. Further study need to transfect human primary T cells and to compare the ability of TCR-redirected T cells to mediate a specific cytotoxicity. It is expected to establish the specific anti-DLBL T cell clone by TCR gene transfection.",
