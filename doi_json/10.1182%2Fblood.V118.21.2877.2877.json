    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2877 FLC assay measures circulating unbound k and l light chains and is of diagnostic and prognostic value in plasma cell disorders. Normalization of FLC ratio is considered a higher level of complete response (CR) in MM but this has not been well validated prospectively. HLC is a novel antibody based assay that targets the unique junctional epitopes between the heavy chain and light chain constant regions of intact immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules. It separately measures in pairs the light chain types of each immunoglobulin class generating ratios of monoclonal Ig/background polyclonal Ig concentrations (i.e IgG\u03ba/IgG\u03bb, IgA\u03ba/IgA\u03bb and IgM\u03ba/IgM\u03bb); potentially simplifying assessment of monoclonal protein response. To assess the prognostic impact of these assays and to correlate them with electrophoretic/immunofixation (SPE/IFE) assessment, we analyzed 497 stored serum samples from patients enrolled in the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) 0102 clinical trial, sponsored by the NHLBI and NCI, of tandem autologous (autoHCT) vs. tandem autoHCT- allogeneic (alloHCT). Samples were collected prior to the first autoHCT and analyzed for FLC (Freelite\u2122) and HLC (Hevylite\u2122) at The Binding Site, UK. Corresponding disease status determination was centrally performed by an expert data review committee using uniform response criteria and correlated with FLC and HLC results. HLC remission was defined as normalization of composite heavy and light chain ratios across all 3 measured heavy/light chain pairs or the normalization of clonal isotype with normal ratios of uninvolved pairs. The demographics of 497 patients with HLC/FLC samples at baseline were concordant with the main study and showed similar patient proportions from the 2 study arms. Of the 211 pts with baseline SPE response better than or equal to a very good partial response (>VGPR), 188 also had an HLC remission (Sensitivity=89%). Comparison of the HLC remission with the >VGPR disease state also identified a specificity of 52%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 58% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 87%. Similarly, all 56 patients in complete remission (CR) by SPE/IFE were in HLC remission. Compared with conventional CR assessment, sensitivity of HLC remission was 100%, specificity 39%, PPV and NPV values of 17% and 100% respectively. FLC remission correlated with >VGPR disease state had a sensitivity of 47%, specificity of 81% and a PPV and NPV of 64% and 67% respectively. Multivariate models for post transplant progression free survival (PFS) indicated that baseline disease response (>VGPR vs. partial remission (PR) orVGPR disease state did not impact PFS (HR 0.96, p=0.83). Abnormal HLC after induction therapy has a high negative predictive value (100%) for identifying patients not achieving CR by uniform response criteria and is also associated with shorter PFS after transplant. FLC ratio normalization had no impact suggesting that stringent CR criteria may need further validation. Disclosures: Krishnan: Celgene: Speakers Bureau; Millenium: Speakers Bureau.
