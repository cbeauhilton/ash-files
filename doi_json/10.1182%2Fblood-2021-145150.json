    "abstract_text": "Background: Salvage chemotherapy followed by high-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) is the standard treatment of young patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A complete remission before ASCT is the most important prognosis factor for a better outcome. Selinexor is a first-in-class, oral selective inhibitor of nuclear export compound, an exportin 1 [XPO1] inhibitor, which, through XPO1 blockade, causes nuclear accumulation and activation of tumor suppressor proteins, reduction in oncoproteins and cancer cell apoptosis. Selinexor has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of R/R DLBCL, de novo or transformed from follicular lymphoma (FL) pts after \u22652 therapies. The phase Ib SELINDA (EUDRACT 2015-005612-15) study assessed safety and efficacy of selinexor, in combination with R-GDP for pts with R/R B-cell lymphoma. Patients & methods: Eligible pts < 70 years with R/R B-cell lymphoma after first or second treatment failure received every 21 days (d) 3 cycles of rituximab 375 mg/m\u00b2 on d1, dexamethasone 40 mg on d1 to 4, cisplatin 75 mg/m\u00b2 d1 and gemcitabine 1 gr/m\u00b2 on d1 and 8 (R-GDP) in combination with escalating doses of selinexor. The starting dose (dose level 1, DL1) 40 mg was given on days 1, 3, 8, 10 (Cohort A), and from December 2017 on days 1, 8 and 15 (Cohort B). The dose-variation scheme followed a traditional \"3+3\" design (DL1: 40 mg; DL2: 60 mg). The primary endpoint of SELINDA was the determination of the recommended phase 2 dose of selinexor in combination with R-GDP. Secondary and exploratory endpoints were safety, efficacy, and feasibility of ASCT after selinexor-R-GDP. Results: The R2PD for selinexor in combination with R-GDP was established as 40 mg on days 1, 8, and 15 (Maerevoet, IMCL 2021#176). Between January 2017 and January 2021, 32 pts received selinexor-R-GDP. We focused on the 18 pts who received the R2PD: 15 had DLBCL, 2 FL, 1 marginal zone lymphoma. In this cohort, median age was 61 years (range 44-69); 14 pts (78%) has stage III/IV. Thirteen pts received 1 previous line before inclusion, 5 pts received 2 previous lines. At inclusion, 6 pts had refractory disease and 12 relapsed. Four pts prematurely discontinued treatment: 2 for thrombocytopenia, 1 for COVID, 1 for progression. Major adverse events (AEs) in >10% of pts were reversible neutropenia (50%), thrombocytopenia (39%), and nausea (22%). No AEs leading to death were observed. Seven pts (39%) achieved a complete metabolic response (CMR), 5 pts (28%) partial metabolic response (PMR). Overall response rate (CMR+PMR) assessed at the end of treatment according to Lugano classification was 67% (12 of 18). Nine of the 15 pts (60 %) with DLBCL had metabolic response (CMR:4, PMR:5). Per protocol, peripheral stem cell collection and ASCT were optional, 4 pts of this RP2D cohort proceeded to high dose therapy (BEAM) and ASCT. Conclusion : This study established the safety profile of weekly 40mg of Selinexor in combination with R-GDP for R/R B cell lymphoma with an ORR of 67%. Reversible AEs are expected for platinum-based regimen. An ongoing randomized phase 2 study comparing R-GDP and R-GDP plus selinexor in pts with R/R DLBCL will now establish the safety and efficacy of the combination.
