    "abstract_text": "BCL6 encodes a BTB/POZ zinc finger (ZF) transcriptional repressor which is essential for normal germinal center (GC) reactions. Its dysregulated expression contributes to the pathogenesis of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The BCL6 gene consists of ten exons, BCL6 translation start site is located in exon 3, and the six-ZF DNA binding domain is encoded by exons 7 to 10. BCL6S , was cloned from the cDNA of a BCL-6 positive cell line, DHL-16. DNA sequencing showed that BCL6S was a normal splicing isoform that excludes the entire exon 7 of the BCL6 gene and encodes a 650 amino acid (aa) protein. BCL6S was detected by RT-PCR in all human cell lines and tissues expressing BCL6, but was not detected in the mouse B cell lymphoma cell line A20. BCL6S accounts for 1/8 to 1/10 of total BCL6 transcripts. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that BCL6S could repress typical BCL6 target genes ( BCL6 , CD23b , Blimp1, MIP1 \u03b1 ) as effectively as the full length BCL6 . BCL6S retains the last four ZFs of BCL6 and localizes in the cell nucleus. Protein-protein interaction assays confirmed that BCL6 and BCL6S could form homodimers and heterodimers. DNA binding assays showed no affinity differences between BCL6 and BCL6S; however, a single mutation at the N-terminus of the POZ domain (L19 to H) not only disrupted BCL6S dimerization but also significantly decreased the DNA binding affinity, indicating that BCL6 dimerization may stabilize the ZF-DNA binding. In conclusion, we have identified a novel BCL6 splicing isoform. BCL6S, a compact repressor as potent as BCL6. POZ dimerization plays an important role in stabilization of BCL6 DNA binding whereas the first two ZFs are not absolutely required. The biological role of BCL6S in GC B cells needs to be further investigated."
