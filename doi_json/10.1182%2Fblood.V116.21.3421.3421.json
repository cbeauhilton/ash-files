    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3421 Background: BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors DAS, nilotinib and IM have become the primary treatment modality for patients (pts) with CML-CP. Pre-treatment comorbid conditions have been proposed to help select a second-line BCR-ABL inhibitor for IM-resistant CML-CP. The DASISION trial is a large Phase 3 trial comparing DAS with IM as initial treatment in pts with newly diagnosed CML-CP and has demonstrated superior efficacy of DAS 100 mg once daily after a minimum follow-up of 12 months (Kantarjian, H, et al. N Engl J Med 2010;362:2260). This analysis assessed the impact of baseline comorbidities on safety and efficacy of these agents when used as initial therapy for CML-CP. Methods: 519 pts with newly diagnosed CML-CP were randomized to either DAS 100 mg once daily (n = 259) or IM 400 mg once daily (n = 260). Key exclusion criteria included serious uncontrolled medical disorders or active infections; uncontrolled or serious cardiovascular disease; prior or concurrent malignancy; inadequate hepatic or renal function; and ECOG performance status of \u2265 3. Pts were analyzed according to the number (0, \u2265 1 and \u2265 2) and type of baseline comorbidity (allergic, dermatologic, diabetes, endocrine-metabolic, gastrointestinal, hematologic-lymphatic, hepatobiliary, hyperlipidemia, musculoskeletal, renal and respiratory), and age (< 46, 46\u201365 and > 65 y). Complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), major molecular response (MMR) and drug-related adverse events (AEs) were analyzed across these groups. Cardiovascular comorbidities were analyzed separately and are not included here. Results: Across the 2 treatment arms, 74% of the pts had 3 1 baseline comorbidity and 47% had 3 2. The distribution of comorbidities including allergic (n = 61), dermatologic (n = 62), diabetes (n = 31), endocrine/metabolic (n = 98), gastrointestinal (n = 176), hematologic/lymphatic (n = 57), hepatobiliary (n = 56), hyperlipidemia (n = 41), musculoskeletal (n = 150), neoplasia (n = 17), renal (n = 33) and respiratory (n = 72) was balanced across the 2 arms. Proportions of pts across 3 Hasford risk groups were similar between pts with baseline comorbidity and those without. Safety profiles of DAS and IM in pts with and without baseline comorbidities were comparable ( Table ). Proportions of pts with at least 1 dose interruption or dose reduction were also similar with or without any comorbidity ( Table ). Pts with 3 2 comorbidities and pt grouped by comorbidity type including diabetes mellitus, hepatobiliary conditions and hyperlipidemia also had generally similar safety profiles. In both arms, the 12-mo rates of CCyR and MMR were similar ( Table ). In DAS-treated pts with diabetes (n = 18), hepatobiliary conditions (n = 32) and hyperlipidemia (n = 22), CCyR rates were 67, 78 and 96%, respectively; the respective MMR rates were 44, 56 and 59%. IM pts with diabetes (n = 13), hepatobiliary conditions (n = 24) and hyperlipidemia (n = 19) had CCyR rates of 69, 75 and 79%, respectively; and MMR rates of 15, 29 and 32%, respectively. In DAS-treated pts, CCyR rates were 88% for pts aged < 46 y (n = 128), 78% for those aged 46\u201365 y (n = 111) and 85% for those aged > 65 y (n = 20); the corresponding MMR rates were 45, 47 and 50%, respectively. The corresponding IM age groups (n = 111, 125 and 24, respectively) had CCyR rates of 70, 70 and 83%, respectively; and MMR rates of 26, 30, 29%, respectively. Safety profiles were generally similar across age groups in both treatment arms, except that fluid retention rates in pts aged < 46, 46\u201365 and > 65 y were 13, 25 and 35%, respectively, for DAS; and 34, 45 and 67%, respectively, for IM.
