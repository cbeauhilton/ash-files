    "abstract_text": "Homeobox genes (HOX) encode transcription factors that are frequently deregulated in leukemias. Our previous results showed that HOX gene expression differs among genetically characterized subtypes of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Specifically, PML-RARa positive AML patients have overall lowest HOX gene expression which positively correlates with expression of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylases - JMJD3 and UTX and negatively with the expression of DNA methyltransferases - DNMT3a and DNMT3b. Interestingly, JMJD3 was already shown to be a direct target of PML-RARa protein (Martens, JH et al, 2010, Cancer Cell). From these findings we postulated a hypothesis that reduced levels of HOX genes in PML-RARa positive AML are a consequence of suppressed expression of histone demethylases resulting in increased H3K27 methylation and/or of elevated levels of DNMTs leading to de novo DNA methylation. We studied the role of histone demethylases and DNMTs in the regulation of HOX gene expression and the effect of treatment in PML-RARa positive cell lines (NB4 and ATRA-resistant clones NB4-LR2 and NB4-MR2). We treated NB4 cell line by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; 1uM), which was described to release the differentiation block caused by the presence of PML-RARa and to degrade the fusion protein. We observed that expression of particular HOX genes (HOXA1, HOXA3, HOXA4, HOXA5, HOXA7, HOXB4, HOXB6) measured by qPCR was significantly increased after ATRA treatment. While the level of JMJD3 was significantly increased upon ATRA treatment as well, the expression of UTX did not change. Furthermore, we detected significantly reduced expression of DNMT3b gene. To exclude a non-specific effect of ATRA, independent of PML-RARa, we used resistant clones LR2 and MR2 bearing mutations in retinoic acid-binding domain. HOX gene expression together with JMJD3, UTX and DNMT3b expression did not change upon ATRA treatment. These results confirm the PML-RARa-dependent regulation of HOX genes. To test the role of JMJD3 in the HOX gene expression regulation, we cultured NB4 cells with a specific inhibitor of histone demethylases, GSK-J4 (1 uM, 10 uM), in the presence of ATRA. The co-treatment caused significant decrease in the expression of studied HOX genes (HOXA1, HOXA3, HOXA5, HOXA7, HOXA10, HOXB4, HOXB6) in comparison to ATRA alone which supports the role of JMJD3 in the transcription regulation. Further, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to investigate if the changes of HOX gene expression upon ATRA and GSK-J4 treatment would correspond with changes of histone code on HOX gene promoter regions. ATRA treatment caused reduction of repressive histone mark (H3K27me3) on particular HOX gene promoters (HOXA1, HOXA3, HOXA5, HOXA7), by contrast, combinational treatment of ATRA and GSK-J4 reversed this effect. Accordingly, we detected that ATRA/GSK-J4 co-treatment reduced active histone mark H3K4me2. Next we were interested if JMJD3 inhibition would interfere with the differentiation effect of ATRA. As shown previously, ATRA treatment alone caused differentiation of NB4 cell line whereas the combination with GSK-J4 did not reduce the effect. Interestingly, in addition to differentiation it led cells to apoptosis. Combination of drugs (ATRA - 1uM, GSK-J4 - 1, 2, 5uM) increased significantly the percentage of dead cells in comparison to ATRA or GSK treatment alone (GSK-J4 alone vs in combination with ATRA, 1uM - 1.8 fold, 2uM - 2.2 fold, 5 uM - 2.3 fold increase). Next we measured apoptosis in resistant clones LR2 and MR2. In both cases the highest concentration used of GSK-J4 (5uM) in combination with ATRA caused significant increase of dead cells as well (LR2 - 2.1 fold, MR2 - 2.0 fold increase). Our results indicate that JMJD3 is responsible for the regulation of HOX gene expression in PML-RARa positive leukemia since changes of HOX gene expression correspond with histone modifications on the regions of HOX gene promoters. We assume that DNA methylation driven by DNMT3b can also participate in this process. Moreover, our findings demonstrate potential therapeutic implications of GSK-J4 inhibitor in combination with ATRA in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who are not responsive to ATRA monotherapy.
