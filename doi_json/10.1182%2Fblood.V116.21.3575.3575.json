    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3575 Unconjugated monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) have proven value in the therapy of CLL, and alemtuzumab (ALEM) has efficacy in patients with purine analog refractory/p53 defective disease. Although the mechanisms of action of ALEM in vivo are not fully defined, complement dependant cytotoxicity (CDC) appears to play an important role. ALEM CDC resistance in a subpopulation of CLL cells in vivo could thus contribute to treatment failure. We hypothesized that the CD20 targeted complement activating human MoAb ofatumumab (OFA) would increase complement activation (as manifested by C3b deposition) as well as CDC in CLL cells treated with ALEM in vitro. Methods: We have completed experiments on 4 of 15 specimens collected from patients with progressive untreated CLL. CLL cells were isolated from blood by density gradient centrifugation and negative selection with magnetic beads. CD52 and CD20 expression were measured with fluorescent beads (Quantum MESF, Bangs Laboratories, IN). CLL cells were treated at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 10 6 /ml with 10 mcg/ml of ALEM (Genzyme) and/or OFA (G.S.K.) in AIM V medium (Invitrogen CA) and 10% standard normal human serum (NHS) (Sigma, MO) as a source of complement for 1 hour at 37C. Absolute viable cell counts were assayed with counting beads (TruCOUNT, BD, CA) and propidium iodide (PI) staining (Sigma) using a FACSCalibur (BD) and CellQuest Pro software (BD). CDC was determined by comparing counts to CLL cells treated with NHS alone. Membrane levels of CD59, bound MoAb, and deposited C3b on the CLL cells membranes were measured by flow cytometry using using the anti-CD59 antibody FITC-CD59 (BD), mouse anti-human Fc antibody FITC-HB43, and the anti-C3b antibody FITC-7C12. To study ALEM CDC resistant cells, CLL cells were first treated with ALEM and NHS as detailed above. Surviving viable cells were isolated using density gradient centrifugation and then retreated. C5 deficient serum (Sigma) was used in experiments to determine MoAb binding and C3b deposition in the entire CLL cell population. Results: Binding of either ALEM or OFA to the CLL cells in NHS resulted in activation of complement and deposition of large amounts of membrane C3b on the cells. However, ALEM induced higher levels of C3b deposition (delta MFI 220) and caused more CDC (73% vs. 18%) compared to OFA. This correlated well with the higher levels of expression of CD52 vs. CD20 expression in CLL cells (143 \u00d710 3 , range 131 \u00d710 3 \u2013 159 \u00d710 3 vs. mean 20 \u00d710 3 molecules/cell, range 10 \u00d710 3 \u2013 28 \u00d710 3 ). Studies with the anti-Fc antibody showed that only a small subpopulation of CLL cells had weak MoAb binding. Addition of OFA to ALEM increased complement-mediated C3b deposition. In three patients with high initial ALEM CDC, addition of OFA did not appreciably increase CDC (81% to 87%). However, in one patient with cells that were less sensitive to ALEM CDC, addition of OFA did appreciably increase CDC (51% to 86%). There was no relationship between levels of CD59 expression and CDC. All four CLL specimens studied contained a subpopulation of cells that were resistant to CDC (mean 13%, range 9\u201318%) despite robust C3b deposition. Conclusions: These data suggests that there are multiple mechanisms of resistance to MoAb-mediated CDC including: 1. Low MoAb binding because of low target antigen expression; 2. Insufficient C3b deposition after MoAb ligation and; 3. Intrinsic resistance in some cells in cells in which high levels of C3b deposition were clearly demonstrable. OFA can increase MoAb binding, C3b deposition, and CDC in CLL cells treated with ALEM. However, addition of OFA does not overcome the intrinsic resistance of a small subpopulation of CLL cells to CDC. Future studies will be needed to examine these resistance mechanisms and to develop interventions to disrupt them. In addition, membrane C3b could be a target for complement dependent cellular cytotoxity in these CDC resistant cells. Disclosures: Taylor: G.S.K.: Research Funding; Genmab: Research Funding.
