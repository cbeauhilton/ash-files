    "abstract_text": "Plasmacytosis is commonly seen in the bone marrow biopsies of patients with acquired immunodefficiency disease AIDS and human HIV virus infection. Polyclonal increase of immunoglobulin is very common. However few cases of plasma cell dyscrasia are reported. The purpose of this abstract is to show our institution experience with plasma cell dyscrasia and HIV infection. For the last ten years ten patients were identified based on bone marrow biopsy, immunoelectophoresis and immunofixation, twenty four hours urine collection and urine electrophoresis and immunofixation. Immuno staining for kappa and lambda light chain to check for clonality were done on four cases. Mean age of patients is 49 years (range 33 to 59 years). Seven were black, two hispanic and one white. Nine were males and one female. All patients had plasmacytosis on bone marrow more than 30% and protiurea of more than one gram. five patients had nephrotic range protien urea. one patient had IgA lambda, one patient had Ig G kappa All patients had low CD4 counts except two patients with CD4 above 200 and have long standing HIV infection. One patient presented with hepatosplenomegally and increased IgM level and waldnestrome looking plasmacytoid lymphocytes. One patient had plasmablast and plasma cells syncitia who had rapidly fatal disease. one patient expired of respiratory failure before treatment. One patient, a female presented with plasma cell leukemia and did respond to Doxil, vincristine and dexamethasone therapy. She is alife. Two other patients with long standing HIV infection and CD4 count above 200 are still alife both patients were treated initially with Thalidomide and dexamethasone with excellent response. one of them failed Thalidomide after more than one year response and currently on his fourth cycle of velcaid (proteosome inhibitor). All patients were not on HIV therapy at time of diagnosis. In conclusion plasma cell dyscrasia with HIV infection do respond to treatment with durable response. Repetetive antigenic stimulation with HIV-1 p24 antigen are the proposed mechnism of oncogenesis."
