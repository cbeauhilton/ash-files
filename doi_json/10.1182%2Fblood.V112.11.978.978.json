    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative treatment option for most high-risk patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, many high-risk patients regenerate with blasts or relapse early after induction therapy. Thus, consolidation with allogeneic HSCT in first CR is often not possible. Performing upfront allogeneic HSCT for remission induction as part of induction therapy has the potential to circumvent these problems and might furthermore reduce cumulative toxicity in high-risk patients. Therefore, in 2003 we started a prospective multicenter randomized trial that investigates both the feasibility and efficacy of upfront allogeneic stem cell transplantation for remission induction in high-risk AML patients. Methods: The AML2003 study compares in a randomized fashion an intensified treatment approach using upfront allogeneic transplantation in high risk patients as part of the induction therapy (IT) during marrow aplasia achieved by DA (daunorubicin 60 mg/ m2 \u2013 day 3\u20135; cytarabine 100 mg/m2 \u2013 day1\u20137) to a \u201cconventional\u201d treatment strategy, which allows for allogeneic transplantation only in patients achieving remission after two induction courses (DA). To do this, rapid analysis of cytogenetics, FLT3 status and HLA-DNA-typing of the patient and possible family donors is of utmost importance. This \u201cfast search diagnostics\u201d together with routine analyses of morphology and immunophenotyping is accomplished centrally in all enclosed patients. The dose-reduced preparative regimen for upfront allogeneic stem cell transplantation within induction therapy consisted of melphalan 150mg/m 2 and fludarabine 150mg/m 2 . Results : Until the last update we recruited 679 patients <= 60 years with de novo (n=570) or secondary (n=109) AML. Out of 340 patients randomized for an intensified treatment approach we identified 139 patients (41%) with high-risk defined by cytogenetic criteria (n=87), FLT3 status (n=15) or day 15 blast count (n=37). Fast search strategy revealed HLA identical donors (related or unrelated) for 106 patients. Consequently, 78 high-risk AML patients assigned to the intensified treatment strategy received allogeneic transplantation. Upfront allogeneic stem cell transplantation for remission induction was feasible in 28 high-risk AML patients during marrow aplasia after IT1 (n=10) or IT2 (n=18), respectively. Fifteen of these patients received unrelated grafts. Conclusions: These preliminary results show that rapid risk profiling and fast donor-search is feasible in a large multi-center study. This leads to a significant proportion of upfront allogeneic stem cell transplants as part of the induction therapy within the group of high-risk AML patients, which may improve the disastrous prognosis of this group of patients in the future.",
