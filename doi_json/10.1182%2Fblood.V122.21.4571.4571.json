    "abstract_text": "Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an ester prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA) has been used successfully for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Most MMF dosing regimens and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters have been established in solid organ transplant recipients. Empiric fixed-dose-escalation strategies have failed to achieve target MPA exposure, especially in the early period following conditioning therapy. We hypothesized that a PK-based dosing approach using a novel continuous infusion (CI) method of MMF will be able to achieve and maintain target MPA exposure. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of this MMF dosing approach in pediatric BMT recipients. Fifteen patients were enrolled in the study. The median age at transplant was 8.4 years (0.9 \u2013 21.5); eight were female and seven were male. Thirteen patients were transplanted for hematologic malignancies and two patients for nonmalignant diseases. Stem cell sources included matched-sibling bone marrow in seven, 10/10 allele matched donor bone marrow in four, and unrelated cord blood in four cases. All patients received a myeloablative conditioning regimen with either cyclophosphamide-TBI (n=8) or busulfan-cyclophosphamide (n=7). In addition, of eight unrelated donor transplants, six patients received equine ATG and two received fludarabine. All patients received cyclosporine A and MMF for GVHD prophylaxis. Intravenous (IV) cyclosporine was initiated on day -2 as a continuous infusion (target blood level: 160 to 250 ng/mL). IV MMF was started on day \u201c0\u201d in a dose of 15 mg/kg every 8 hours. After a minimum of five doses, serial blood samples were collected within one dosing interval for the 1 st PK analysis. Using these results, MMF was converted from intermittent IV to CI administration to target total MPA AUC 0-24 of 40-80 mcg/mL/hr. MMF dose was adjusted to maintain a total MPA steady-state concentration (C ss ) of 1.7-3.3 mcg/mL. CI MMF was converted to every-8-hour oral dosing when patients were tolerating oral medications. A 2 nd PK study was performed after a minimum of five oral doses, and dose adjustments were made to maintain a total MPA trough concentration (C trough ) of 1-3.5 mcg/mL. MMF was continued until day 42, and in the absence of acute GVHD, tapered off over 8 weeks. On the initial 15 mg/kg q8 IV MMF dose schedule, MPA half-life was 1.3\u00b11.3 hrs and AUC 0-24 was 44.3\u00b160.3 mg* hr/L. During the CI schedule, MMF dose was 44\u00b116 mg/kg/day and MPA AUC 0-24 38.4\u00b120.7 mg* hr/L, and thirteen of fifteen (87%) patients achieved MPA C ss within target of 1.7\u20133.3 mcg/mL. On conversion to oral route, median MMF dose was 45\u00b119mg/kg/day, MPA half-life 1.95\u00b12.3 hrs and AUC 0-24 38.3\u00b116.0 mg* hr/L. MPA clearance was 17\u00b114 ml/min/kg. Higher steady state MPA concentrations were achieved with CI method (C ss 1.6 \u00b10.9 mcg/mL) compared with intermittent IV or oral dosing (C trough 0.7\u00b10.9 mcg/mL). All patients achieved neutrophil engraftment at 13 \u00b1 11 days post-transplant, and platelet engraftment at 45 \u00b1 72 days post-transplant. Seven out of 15 patients (47%) developed stage I-IV acute GVHD. Three patients had stage III-IV aGVHD (20%); they were steroid-refractory but went into remission with additional therapy. For 11 patients with a minimum of one year follow-up post-transplant, one (9%) developed \u201coverlap\u201d chronic GVHD. MMF was discontinued without weaning in four patients: in three of them due to concern of delay in blood count recovery and all of them achieved hematopoietic engraftment, and in one patient with severe aGVHD due to potential concern for MMF gut toxicity. One patient with severe congenital neutropenia developed autologous hematopoietic recovery by day 52. One patient with ALL died of relapse 150 days after transplant. With a median follow-up of 23 months (range 100 days to 3.6 y), 14 out of 15 patients are alive, and one-year event-free survival and overall survival are 83% and 92% respectively. In conclusion, we show that continuous infusion of MMF is feasible and well-tolerated. In this pilot PK study, we observed no toxic deaths, excellent engraftment, and low rates of grade III-IV aGVHD and cGVHD. The PK studies showed significantly lower half-life and higher drug clearance in pediatric BMT recipients compared to stable pediatric renal transplant patients. This regimen deserves further validation in a larger cohort of pediatric patients undergoing myeloablative transplantation.
