    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3896 Poster Board III-832 We previously reported the finding of significantly raised levels of mature microRNA 16 (miR-16) in CD34 + cells from PV patients (pts) (Guglielmelli P et al, ASH 2008, 179A). Mature miR-16 can derive from both miR-16-1 at chr13q14.3 and miR-16-2 at chr3q26.1, which differ in their precursor miRNA (pre-miR) sequence. To distinguish between either genes as a source of increased miR-16 levels we quantified each pre-miR in PV CD34 + ; we observed that the premiR-16-1/16-2 ratio decreased from 1.47\u00b1 2.38 in controls (ctr) to 0.52\u00b1 0.34 in PV (P<.001). To confirm the preferential expression of miR-16-2 we knocked-down miR-16-1 or miR-16-2 using specific siRNAs; in PV CD34 + treated with miR16-2 siRNA the miR-16 levels were 90\u00b19% lower than in scramble-treated cells while miR16-1 siRNA caused only a 10\u00b13% reduction (P <.01). Levels of miR-16 in PV CD34 + were not correlated to the JAK2 V671F burden; also, there was no modification of miR-16 in JAK2V617F mutant HEL or UKE-1 cells after treatment with the JAK2 inhibitor AZD1480. These data suggested that the abnormally increased mature miR-16 in PV are largely derived from miR-16-2 . To address underlying mechanisms we performed direct sequencing at the miR-16-1 and miR-16-2 regions without detecting sequence abnormalities; also we excluded gene copy number changes (SNP 6.0 array). The promoter of miR16-2 is not characterized yet, but recent data suggest that it might be the same of the structural maintenance of chromosomes-4 ( SMC4 ) gene, to which miR16-2 is intronic. We have found a significant correlation between miR-16 and SMC4 mRNA levels in PV CD34 + (R=0.77, P<.001); furthermore, after induced erythroid differentiation of normal CD34 + a concurrent increase of miR-16 and SMC4 mRNA was observed, indirectly supporting a shared regulatory control. Methylation-specific PCR and sequencing at upstream CpG-rich regions discovered that PV patients had unmethylated CpGs compared to control cells, suggesting that methylation may concur to miR-16-2 regulated expression. To evaluate involvement of miR16 in abnormal erythropoiesis of PV, we first analyzed the kinetics of miR-16 during erythroid differentiation of CD34 + . Levels of miR-16 steadily increased from day 6, when progenitors were switched from proliferative to differentiative phase, up to day 12-14 and, at any time point considered, those measured in PV cells were significantly greater than in ctrs (P= .01). Also, a time-dependent increase of miR16 paralleling the transcription of beta-globin mRNA was observed in hydroxyurea or Na-butyrate treated K562 cells. Then we over-expressed (Amaxa) mature miR16 in normal CD34 + at day 6 of culture, and found that the percentage of CD36 + /GPA + cells increased from 13.6\u00b14.8% in scramble to 28.8\u00b111.3% (P<.05); notably, even in the absence of EPO, some GPA + cells were generated from miR-16-transduced CD34 + . Furthermore, normal CD34 + cells transfected with miR-16 produced significantly increased number of CFU-e and BFU-E (174\u00b1100 and 1283\u00b1250/10 3 CD34+) compared to scramble cells (105\u00b190 and 733\u00b190; P<.01) while myeloid colonies were unchanged. A genome-wide expression profiling in normal CD34 + transfected with miR-16-2 siRNA discovered 618 genes significantly de-regulated, among which genes involved in erythroid differentiation such as NFE2, MYB, FGFR2, HLF, GATA-1 and globin family genes ( HBA1, HBA2, HBB ). Overall, these data support a role of miR-16 in normal erythropoiesis. In case of PV we employed a knock-down strategy using either pre-miR-16-1 or pre-miR-16-2 siRNAs. The use of miR-16-2 siRNA resulted in significant reduction of Epo-independent erythroid colonies (EEC) from GFP-sorted CD34 + cells (60\u00b118% lower than scramble) while no change was observed in cell treated with anti-miR-16-1. These data were confirmed in independent experiments using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC): the number of EEC decreased from 207\u00b120 to 170\u00b123 to 95\u00b125/10 5 MNC in cells transduced with scramble, anti miR-16-1 or miR-16-2, respectively (P<.01 for miR-16-2 vs others). Also the number of BFU-E generated in cytokine-supplemented cultures of PV MNC was significantly reduced by miR-16-2 siRNA (360\u00b180) compared to cells transduced with scramble (540\u00b1120) or miR-16-1 (500\u00b187) (P<.001). In summary, these data support a role for deregulated miR-16-2 in abnormal erythropoiesis of PV, and anticipate its possible relevance as a therapeutic target.
