    "abstract_text": "Background: In this study we cloned a vector based on a self-inactivating lentiviral backbone containing MDR1 (multidrug resistance 1 gene) connected by an ECMV-IRES-element with MGMT P140K (O6-BG-resistant mutant of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase). The chemoprotective potential of this HR\u2032SIN-MDR-IRES-MGMT combination vector was compared to single vectors (HR\u2032SIN-MDR, HR\u2032SIN-MGMT). Methods: HL60 and CD34+ cells were transduced with the various vectors. After chemotherapeutical treatment MTT assays were used to detect chemoresistance levels in HL60 cells, CD34+ cells were held in liquid culture under differentiation conditions and analysed by FACS for MDR1 expression. Results: HL60 cells transduced with the combination vector showed significant chemoresistance to O6-BG/ACNU (IC50 13x higher compared to untransduced control), the IC50 of cells transduced with HR\u2032SIN-MGMT was 35x higher. The IC50 of paclitaxel (MDR1 substrate) was 24x higher in cells transduced with HR\u2019SIN-MDR and 25x higher with HR\u2019SIN-MDR-IRES-MGMT compared to untransduced control. Combined exposure of cells to O6-BG/ACNU and paclitaxel showed a survival advantage of cells transduced with the combination vector (IC50 6.25x higher), for the single vectors the IC50 was 1.63x higher (MDR1) and 2.08x higher (MGMT) compared to untransduced control. Treatment of CD34+ cells with increasing concentrations of doxorubicin (up to 0.8 \u03bcM) resulted in a higher fraction of MDR1-positive cells either with HR\u2032SIN-MDR (26.6x) or with HR\u2032SIN-MDR-IRES-MGMT (30.6x) compared to untreated cells. After combination treatment (20\u03bcM O6-BG/16\u03bcM BCNU and 0.4\u03bcM doxorubicin) the fraction of MDR1-positive cells was higher for HR\u2032SIN-MDR-IRES-MGMT (14x) than HR\u2032SIN-MDR (8x) transduced cells. Conclusion: The protective effect of the combination vector is comparable with the single vectors for monotherapy and superior for combined therapy. The combination vector presents simultaneous protective effects of two drug resistance genes, thus reducing the risk of insertional mutagenesis by one transduction process. Consequently our results might help to reduce myelotoxic side effects and increase the chemotherapeutic efficiency."
