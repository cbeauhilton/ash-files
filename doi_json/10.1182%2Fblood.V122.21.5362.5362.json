    "abstract_text": "Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) has been implicated in regulating the NF-kB and JNK signal transduction pathways; and, thus, is likely to promote tumor cell proliferation and osteoclast formation. F-box proteins such as the E3 ligase component Fbxo3 and another F-box family member Fbxl 2, regulate TRAF protein signaling. First, we investigated TRAF6 expression in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) from multiple myeloma (MM) patients with progressive disease or in remission and healthy subjects. \u00a0The results showed higher TRAF6 protein expression among MM patients with progressive disease than among those in remission or healthy subjects. Notably, changes in TRAF6 protein expression in MM BMMCs were found to correlate with response of individual patients to treatment with the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib or carfilzomib. We have previously reported inhibition of MM cell proliferation and increase of apoptosis through regulation of the NF-kB and JNK pathways using a silencing TRAF6 C-domain mRNA construct. In this study, we cloned a 167 amino acid (in residues 333 to 508) portion of the TRAF6 dominant negative (TRAF6dn) and synthesized decoy peptides of the TRAF6 interaction domain with CD40 and the TRAF6-RANK binding domain. Decreases in cell proliferation and increase in cell apoptosis in MM BMMCs treated with TRAF6dn occurred in a concentrationdependent fashion. We also found TRAF6dn markedly inhibited osteoclast cell formation of monocytes induced by RANKL and mCSF in a dose-dependent manner. Next, we examined the effect of TRAF6dn on NF-kB and JNK by determining phosphorylation of JUN kinase kinase (JNKK), which activates the MAP kinase homologues SAPK and JNK in response to IL-1 receptor stimulation. MM BMMCs exposed to the TRAF6dn fragment or TRAF6 decoy peptide showed reduced phosphoNF-kB protein and phosphorylation of JNKK. These studies suggest that the TRAF6dn or combined TRAF6 decoy and CD40 decoy peptide may be excellent agents to block both MM cell growth and osteoclast formation in MM. We further investigated the protein expression of Fbxo 3, Fbxl 2 and TRAF6 in fresh BMMCs from MM patients with progressive disease or in remission. Results of Western blot analysis showed protein expression of Fbxo 3 and TRAF6 was increased and Fbxl 2 was decreased among patients with progressive disease compared to patients in remission. Thus, these results may offer a new mechanism through which MM tumor cells are regulated and provide a new therapeutic approach to treat MM and reduce the clinical consequences resulting from enhanced bone loss that commonly occur in these patients.
