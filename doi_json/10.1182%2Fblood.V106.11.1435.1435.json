    "abstract_text": "Post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) occurs with an incidence of 1.7\u20133.3% and 5.6\u201313% in adults and children respectively. Mortality remains high with rates of 40\u201370%; approximately double that of other high grade lymphoproliferative disorders. To date, no preventative or therapeutic regimen has been shown to have an overall survival advantage. We examined the clinical and histological features of 31 adults and children diagnosed with PTLD following liver transplantation in a single centre to determine which factors might influence clinical outcome. Patient records were reviewed from the database of cases at King\u2019s College Hospital from 1988\u20132005 including both children and adults. 60 cases were identified and in 31 cases, relevant data could be obtained. This gave an incidence of PTLD of 1.7% and 2.7% in adults and children respectively. 10 of the 31 cases were children. Most children had an original diagnosis of extra hepatic biliary atresia; the adults had a broad range of primary liver disease. At the time of diagnosis of PTLD, the mean age was 34 years (1.5\u201364). The mean onset of PTLD from the time of liver transplantation was 50 months (3\u2013156). Approximately equal numbers of patients were on either 1, 2 or 3 forms of immunosuppression when diagnosed. 12 patients presented with extranodal disease and 13 with Stage 4 disease. In 18 patients the IPI could be assessed, with 14 having an IPI of 2 or more. The histological diagnosis in 20 patients was high grade B cell lymphoma, 1 high grade T cell, 1 TNK cell, 1 Hodgkins, 1 low grade B cell, 1 mixed cell, 1 B cell, 1 high grade, 1 plasmacytoid variant and in 3 cases the histological diagnosis was unknown. The tissue affected by lymphoproliferative disease was positive for EBV in 22 cases and 6 patients (all aged 1 year post transplant was 52.6% compared to 25% in those developing PTLD<1 year post transplant (p=0.28). 1 patient treated with immunoreduction alone survived. Longer term remissions appear to be achieved in younger patients, those who present later following liver transplantation and in whom chemotherapy is used. The amount of immunosuppression, EBV positivity of tissue and stage of disease at presentation do not appear to influence outcome. IPI scores are high in many patients although it remains unclear whether these are applicable to PTLD.",
