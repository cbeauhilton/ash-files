    "abstract_text": "There is clinical evidence that a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect occurs following allogeneic stem cell transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, the potency of this GVL effect is often associated with unwanted graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and disease relapse remains a major contributor to treatment failure. Wilms\u2019 tumor gene 1 (WT1) is overexpressed in 70\u201390% of cases of ALL and has been identified as a convenient minimal residual disease (MRD) marker. WT1 is an attractive immunotherapeutic target in ALL because peptides derived from WT1 can induce CD8+ T-cell responses, and being non-allelic, WT1 would be unlikely to provoke GVHD. We investigated whether CD8+ T-cells directed against an HLA-A*0201 restricted epitope of WT1 (WT126) occur in ALL patients during the early phase of immune reconstitution post-SCT (days 30\u2013180). We analyzed CD8+ T-cell responses against WT1 in 10 HLA-A*0201+ ALL SCT recipients and their respective donors using WT1/HLA-A*0201 tetrameric complexes and flow cytometry for intracellular IFN-gamma. We studied the kinetics WT1-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in consecutive samples obtained post-SCT. CD8+ T-cells recognizing WT1 were detected ex vivo in samples from 5 of 10 ALL patients post-SCT but not in patients pre-SCT. WT1-tetramer+ CD8+ T cells had a predominantly effector memory phenotype (CD45RO+CD27\u2212CD57+). WT1 gene expression in pre-SCT and donor samples was assayed by quantitative real-time PCR (RQ-PCR). WT1 expression in PBMC from healthy donors was significantly lower than in patients (median 0, range 0\u201366 \u00d710 \u22124 WT1/ABL compared to patients, median 12, range 0\u20132275 \u00d710 \u22124 WT1/ABL) ( P < 0.01). There was a strong correlation between the emergence of WT1-specific CD8+ T cells and a reduction in WT1 gene expression ( P < 0.001) (as depicted below) suggesting direct anti-ALL activity post-SCT. Disappearance of WT1-specific CD8+ T-cells from the blood coincided with reappearance of WT1 gene transcripts, consistent with a molecular relapse, further supporting the direct involvement of WT1-specific CD8+ T-cells in the GVL response. These results provide evidence for the first time of spontaneous T-cell reactivity against a leukemia antigen in ALL patients. Our results support the immunogenicity of WT1 in ALL patients post-SCT and a potential application for WT1 peptides in post-transplant immunotherapy of ALL.
