    "abstract_text": "Approximately 15% of multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by a t(4;14) translocation that causes the simultaneous dysregulation of MMSET on der(4) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3) on der(14). We reported several lines of evidence indicating a role for FGFR3 in myeloma tumorigenesis. First, activated FGFR3 is an oncogene capable of transforming fibroblasts. Second, FGFR3 activating mutations are acquired by MM cells during tumor progression. Third, targeted inhibition of FGFR3 leads to terminal differentiation and apoptosis in two t(4;14) MM cell lines. However, expression of FGFR3, but never of MMSET, is lost in about 25% of t(4;14) MM. Therefore, the overexpression of MMSET in all MM tumors with a t(4;14) translocation, and its homology to MLL, the oncogene on 11q23 translocated in acute leukemia suggest a critical role for MMSET in MM. To determine whether MMSET is an oncogene in vivo, we have generated transgenic mice in which MMSET expression in driven in lymphocytes by the lck proximal promoter juxtaposed to the Emu enhancer. Using the same expression vector we and others have obtained specific, high levels of transgene expression in B and T cells from spleen, bone marrow and thymus. Four transgenic lines were generated and although we detected MMSET expression in T cells in each of them, unexpectedly no expression in B cells was seen. This is consistent with our inability to ectopically express MMSET in B cell lines. Nevertheless B lymphoid tumors expressing MMSET developed at 23 month of age in each line (18/51 mice). Only 1/19 wild type matching control mice developed a splenomegaly. By Southern blot, monoclonal rearrangements of IgH, IgL and TCR \u03b2 were detected within the same tumor population. In conclusion, this is the first report that MMSET is an oncogene capable of transforming lymphoid cells in an animal model. We are currently crossing these mice with FGFR3 transgenic mice to assess cooperation between these two oncogenes in tumorigenesis. Obviously a more restricted expression of MMSET in germinal center cells is required to investigate the role of MMSET in MM. Therefore, as we have done for c-myc, we are generating new transgenic mice in which MMSET expression will be activated sporadically in germinal center B cells by somatic hypermutation."
