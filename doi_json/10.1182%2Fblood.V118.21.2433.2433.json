    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2433 We have previously shown that silencing of the tumor suppressor gene, DAPK1, by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms is associated with the pathogenesis of CLL. To elucidate genes and pathways involved in DAPK1 transcriptional regulation, genome-wide siRNA screens were performed using a novel transgene reporter system involving a stably-integrated BAC construct expressing luciferase under the control of the DAPK1 locus. c-FOS and other members of the FOS gene family were identified as positive regulators, implicating the AP-1 pathway in DAPK1 transcription. A subsequent comprehensive examination of the FOS, JUN and ATF gene families in CLL and healthy B cells was performed. As the expression of the AP-1 gene family is highly subject to fluctuations in stress and mitogenic stimuli, freshly isolated cells were cultured using autologous serum conditions, allowing for a uniform establishment of baseline gene expression. This work reveals an alteration of the relative composition of AP-1 transcription factors in CLL, demarked by a substantial reduction in c-FOS gene expression. We find that the inducibility of c-FOS in CLL following MAPK activation by TPA (ERK-MAPK) is impaired 7.0-fold relative to healthy B cells and is completely abrogated following anisomycin (p38-MAPK) stimulation. The level of c-FOS induction following TPA activation can be used to clearly segregate CLL patients into two non-overlapping groups, those with low (mean=4.0-fold reduced expression; range=3.0\u20137.2; n=9) and very low (mean=21.7-fold reduced expression; range=17.6\u201336.7; n=8) following one hour induction versus healthy B cells. The very low c-FOS induction cases are characterized by poor prognostic indicators (IGHV unmutated (0/9 in low vs. 5/8 in very low); 17p, 6q deletion (0/9 in low vs. 3/8 in very low); and a substantially shorter time to progression (102.7\u00b140.4 months in low vs. 10.8\u00b18.6 in very low). Patients with very low c-FOS induction also demonstrate elevated c-MYC induction following activation. TPA-dependent ERK phosphorylation and activation of other immediate early genes, such as EGR1 and c-JUN, is intact in both CLL groups, absolving MAPK pathway dysfunction as a relevant c-FOS silencing mechanism. Reduced c-FOS expression can be partially explained, in the majority of very low c-FOS inducible cases, by elevated levels of miR-155 and miR-221 targeting the c-FOS transcript. Reduced expression of c-FOS and the resulting reconfiguration of AP-1 transcription factor composition may be involved in the pathogenesis of CLL and the subsequent silencing of DAPK1.
