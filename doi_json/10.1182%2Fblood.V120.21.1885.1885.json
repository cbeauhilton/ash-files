    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1885 CD8 + /TCR \u2212 graft facilitating cells (FC) significantly enhance engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in both allogeneic and syngeneic recipients. We have shown that DOCK2 \u2212/\u2212 FC are compromised in cell migration in vitro and facilitating HSC engraftment in vivo . DOCK2 activates the small GTPase Rac and is indispensable for migration of neutrophils, lymphocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC). A recent study demonstrated that DOCK2 \u2212/\u2212 DC were defective in antigen uptake and presentation. FC are a heterogeneous cell population, with a predominant subpopulation resembling plasmacytoid precursor DC. We previously found that FC induced antigen-specific regulatory T cells (T reg ) in vitro and in vivo . In the present study, we evaluated whether DOCK2 \u2212/\u2212 FC could induce T reg . 5\u00d710 5 wild-type (WT) sorted CD4 + CD25 \u2212 splenocyte T cells were incubated with 1\u00d710 5 WT FC or DOCK2 \u2212/\u2212 FC at a 5:1 ratio in U bottom 96-well plates with long-term culture medium (IMEM with 20% horse serum, 10 \u22126 M hydrocortisone and 50\u03bcM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) for up to 6 days. The co-cultures were harvested and CD4 + CD25 + T cells were analyzed for FoxP3 by flow cytometry intracellular staining. WT CD4 + CD25 \u2212 splenocytes were cultured as negative control. Phagocytosis of APC-labeled polystyrene beads by WT and DOCK2 \u2212/\u2212 FC was assessed after incubating FC with the beads for 3 hours. We found that FC induced the generation of CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + T reg in vitro as expected, while DOCK2 deficiency completely abrogated the ability of FC to induce T reg generation. Moreover, the uptake of beads by DOCK2 \u2212/\u2212 FC was significantly impaired compared to their uptake by WT FC. In summary, DOCK2 \u2212/\u2212 FC were unable to induce the generation of CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + T reg in vitro and were compromised in phagocytosis.
