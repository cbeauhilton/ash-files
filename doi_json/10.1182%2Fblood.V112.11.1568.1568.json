    "abstract_text": "Background: Responses to the novel HDAC inhibitor romidepsin were observed in patients (pts) with T-cell lymphoma in a phase 1 NCI trial. Aims: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of romidepsin in the treatment of advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). As an exploratory endpoint, to examine the molecular effects of romidepsin in both CTCL and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). Methods: This Phase 2, open-label, multi-arm, multicenter study enrolled 71 CTCL pts from the NCI and 9 extramural sites. PTCL pts were also enrolled. Clinical results for pts with CTCL and biomarker analyses for both PTCL and CTCL are presented here; clinical results for the PTCL pts are presented elsewhere. This study is now closed to accrual. Pts with recurrent CTCL (Stages IA-IVB) received romidepsin at 14 mg/m 2 as a 4-hr infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 q 28 days. Responses were assessed using a composite endpoint that evaluated overall changes in skin (modified Physicians Global Assessment), lymph nodes, extranodal visceral lesions and abnormal circulating T-cells. Molecular endpoints evaluated in NCI pts were: histone acetylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs); MDR-1 gene expression in PBMCs and in biopsy samples; and blood fetal hemoglobin levels. Results: 71 pts (48 men and 23 women) with a mean age of 56 yrs (range 28\u201384) were enrolled and received romidepsin; 63 pts received \u22652 cycles of therapy. Mean number of prior therapies was 3.4 (range 1\u201310). Objective disease response rates (ORR) are presented in the table. Overall disease control (CR+PR+SD 90 ) was 62% in all pts and 70% in pts who received \u22652 cycles. Target skin lesions were followed and changes were generally similar to overall skin changes. Median duration of response (DOR) was 11 months (mo) and the maximum DOR as of data cut-off was 5.5+ yrs. The most frequent drug-related AEs (all grades, all cycles) were generally mild, including nausea (82%; 4% \u2265grade 3), fatigue (73%; 14% \u2265 grade 3), electrocardiogram T-wave amplitude decreased (69%, 0% \u2265grade 3); hemoglobin decreased (59%, 9% \u2265grade 3), and platelet count decreased (59%; 13% \u2265grade 3). Six pts died within 30 days of study drug administration: 2 after salvage chemotherapy, 1 with ARDS due to PD, 2 with infection, and 1 of unknown cause; 2 of these deaths were considered possibly related to treatment. An increase in all biomarkers measured was observed, although not in all pts. Correlation between global histone H3 acetylation (AcH3) at the 24-hr time point and C max , AUC, and clearance was observed (r = 0.37, 0.36, and \u22120.44, respectively, p = 0.03). Pts with major responses were more likely to have higher levels of AcH3 at 24 hr. Conclusions: This study demonstrates tolerability and durable clinical benefit (ORR of 35% and median DOR of 11 mo in all pts) of romidepsin in pts with recurrent CTCL. Significant responses were observed at all stages of disease, including an ORR of 32% in all pts with stage \u2265IIB and 20% in all pts with stage IV. Time to response was rapid, within 2 mo in most pts, and responses were durable, >6 mo in most pts. Molecular analyses confirmed that romidepsin inhibits its target deacetylases in pts. Increases were not observed in all pts, perhaps reflecting, in part, variable drug exposure or variable response to HDAC inhibition. Correlation of global acetylation with PK parameters suggests that increased drug exposure results in increased global acetylation.  . All Pts N=71 . Pts \u2265 2 cycles N=63 .
