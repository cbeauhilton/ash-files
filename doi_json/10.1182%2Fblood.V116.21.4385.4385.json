    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4385 Several biosimilar versions of branded enoxaparin (Lovenox, Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France) have recently become available throughout the world. These biosimilar enoxaparin preparations are distributed by multiple suppliers in Asia and in North and South America. Enoxaparin represents a complex mixture of oligosaccharides obtained by alkaline depolymerization of porcine mucosal heparin. It is the most widely used low molecular weight heparin which has been validated for clinical use in multiple indications. While the molecular profile and anti-Xa potencies of some of the biosimilar versions of enoxaparin are comparable, product based differences have been reported amongst some of the biosimilar versions of enoxaparin. The purpose of this study was to compare the biochemical and pharmacologic profile of one biosimilar version of enoxaparin, namely Fibrinox (Sandoz SA, Buenos Aires, Argentina) with the branded product Lovenox. The products were compared in equigravimetric amounts, assuming equivalent potency (100 AXa U/mg). Both products exhibited comparable molecular weight profiles in terms of average molecular weight and oligosachharide distribution. Analysis of the antithrombin binding hexasaccharide fractions of Fibrinox and Lovenox indicated the presence of eight distinct hexasaccharides. The relative proportions these hexasaccharides differed between Fibrinox and Lovenox. The anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities were comparable. In the whole blood clot-based assays such as TEG and ACT, both agents produced similar anticoagulant effects. In the plasma based assays such as the APTT, Heptest and thrombin time, both products showed comparable anticoagulant effects in the normal human pooled plasma samples. However, in plasma samples collected from patients with liver disease who were apparently anticoagulant free, the two products showed differences in their anticoagulant effects in the APTT assay (p<0.05). In the TF mediated thrombin generation assay, Fibrinox produced a stronger inhibition of thrombin generation compared to Lovenox (IC50; Fibrinox, 1.6 \u03bc g/ml, Lovenox 2.2 \u03bc g/ml). No differences were observed between the two products in the agonist induced platelet aggregation assays. However in the 14 C serotonin release study, Fibrinox produced a stronger HIT serum mediated 14 C release (p<0.05). Differences in the fibrinokinetic profile and the inhibition of thrombin activatable fibrinolytic inhibitor activation were observed with these LMWHs. These studies suggest while both the molecular profile and the pharmacopoeial potency of Fibrinox is similar to the branded product, these drugs can be differentiated in some of the other assays and should be evaluated in terms of additional pharmacologic mechanisims to demonstrate bioequivalence.
