    "abstract_text": "Introduction : In the past decade, the combination of high-dose melphalan (MEL) and auto-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HCT) with novel agents substantially improved the outcomes in younger patients with multiple myeloma. However, the safety and efficacy of auto-HCT in patients aged \u226565 years remain uncertain. Large clinical trials evaluating the role of auto-HCT in multiple myeloma mostly included patients aged <65 years even in the era of novel agents. Here, we examined the safety and efficacy of auto-HCT in patients with multiple myeloma who were aged \u226565 years. Methods: We examined 2,056 patients aged \u226516 years who underwent auto-HCT for multiple myeloma from 2007 to 2014; they were selected based on the following criteria: (1) first auto-HCT with peripheral blood stem cells; (2) use of MEL alone (100, 140, and 200 mg/m 2 ) as a conditioning regimen; and (3) without planned tandem transplantation. A total of 2,056 patients met these criteria, and 287 of them were aged \u226565 years. The era of novel agents was defined as the date of transplantation after December 2006 because bortezomib was approved for public administration in Japan in December 2006. The primary end-point was 100-day treatment-related mortality (TRM), i.e., not myeloma-related or accidental deaths within 100 days after the first auto-HCT, and the secondary end-point was overall survival (OS). To adjust for a selection bias, the 100-day TRM was compared between two age groups (<65 vs. \u226565 years) by a propensity score analysis with the following factors: sex, immunoglobulin subtype, Durie-Salmon staging system and international staging system (ISS) stages at diagnosis, renal impairment at diagnosis, cytogenetic abnormalities, disease status at transplantation, conditioning regimen, and performance status (PS) at transplantation. Finally, 1:1 matched pairs were extracted. The probability of 100-day TRM was calculated using the Gray test and assessed by cumulative incidence analysis. The probability of OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between groups using the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis for OS was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Results: The median age at transplantation was 66 (range, 65-76) and 57 (range, 18-64) years in the elderly and younger groups, respectively. The number of patients who used 100, 140, and 200 mg/m 2 MEL were 17 (1.0%), 71 (4.0%), and 1,681 (95.0%), respectively, in the younger group and 19 (6.6%), 51 (17.8%), and 217 (75.6%), respectively, in the elderly group, with a significant difference (p<0.001). The number of 100-day TRM and deaths due to disease relapse or progression were 13 (0.7%) and 5 (0.3%), respectively, in the younger group and 3 (1.0%) and 1 (0.3%), respectively, in the elderly group. A matched-pair analysis was performed based on the propensity score, and 263 patients were extracted from each group. The 100-day TRM probability was 0.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.0-2.0%) and 1.2% (95% CI: 0.3-3.1%) in the younger and elderly groups, respectively, without significant difference (p=0.315, Figure 1) in the propensity score-matched pair analysis. The probabilities of 5-year OS after transplantation were 62.5% (95% CI: 58.6-66.1%) and 63.5% (95% CI: 52.2-72.7%) in the younger and elderly groups, respectively, without significant difference (p=0.561, Figure 2). In the multivariate analysis, except age at transplantation (<65 or \u226565 years), gender, immunoglobulin subtype, ISS stage, unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities, disease status at transplantation, and PS were significantly associated with OS. Conclusion: The 100-day TRM and OS were not significantly different between the younger and elderly patients who underwent auto-HCT for multiple myeloma in 2007-2014. We showed that auto-HCT is safe and effective for treating multiple myeloma in elderly patients, particularly in the era of novel agents. A comparable benefit was observed in elderly patients who underwent auto-HCT for multiple myeloma, highlighting the fact that chronologic age alone should not be used to determine transplantation eligibility.
