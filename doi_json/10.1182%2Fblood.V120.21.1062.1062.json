    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1062 Protein palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational modification that regulates both lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions. During the palmitoylation cycle, palmitoylation occurs through a thioester linkage to a cysteine residue. Depalmitoylation occurs primarily through cleavage of this bond by acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1). We have previously demonstrated the presence of APT1 in platelets and showed that APT1 translocates to membranes in an activation-dependent manner. However, the function of APT1 in platelet activation is not known. To determine whether APT1 functions in platelet signal transduction we evaluated the effect of palmostatins, novel small molecule inhibitors of APT1, on platelet function. Palmostatins B and M both inhibited platelet aggregation and \u03b1 -granule secretion induced through protease-activated receptor (PAR) 1 with an IC 50 of 15 \u03bcM. To assess which signaling pathways were affected by APT1 inhibition, we screened palmostatins for their ability to inhibit activation induced by several agonists. Palmostatins blocked platelet aggregation induced by a PAR1 agonist, a PAR4 agonist, TxA 2 , or epinephrine. In contrast, palmostatins failed to inhibit aggregation induced by collagen, PMA, or ionophore. Palmostatins also inhibited \u03b1 -granule exocytosis induced by a PAR1 agonist or TxA 2 , but not exocytosis induced by PMA or ionophore. These results suggested that palmostatins blocked proximal signaling events mediated through G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). To evaluate this supposition, we tested the effect of palmostatin B on PAR1-mediated [Ca 2+ ] i flux. Palmostatin B inhibited PAR1-induced Ca 2+ signaling with and IC 50 of 15 \u03bcM, the same concentration required for inhibition of platelet aggregation and \u03b1 -granule secretion. We have recently described the platelet palmitoylome (Dowal et al., Blood , 118:e62-73) and found several components of the proximal G protein signaling pathway that are palmitoylated, including many G\u03b1 subunits. To directly assess the effect of APT1 inhibition on palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycles on a target G\u03b1 subunit, we evaluated G\u03b1 q palmitoylation using acyl biotin exchange chemistry. Total G\u03b1 q palmitoylation decreased substantially with activation of platelets through PAR1. In the presence of palmostatin B, however, G\u03b1 q palmitoylation increased following PAR1 activation. These results demonstrate that G\u03b1 q is a substrate for APT1. Our studies demonstrate a role for palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycles in proximal signaling pathways downstream of GPCRs and implicate APT1 as an essential regulator of G protein signaling in platelets.
