    "abstract_text": "Background: Iron deficiency, even without a diagnosis of anemia, can be neurodevelopmentally dangerous in pediatric populations. Oral iron supplementation has been the treatment of choice but is associated with poor adherence for several reasons including metallic taste of the tablets, gastric irritation, severe constipation, and daily dosing for several weeks. Intravenous iron has been safely used in adult populations for iron supplementation, but has less commonly been used in pediatric populations. It is hypothesized that pediatric patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) who receive intravenous iron infusions will show normalization of hematologic parameters. Methods: EMR of patients aged 1-21 who received at least one intravenous iron infusion at Cooper University Hospital between 2016 and January 2019 were reviewed for retrospective data collection. Pre-infusion lab values including Hgb, MCV, RBCs and RDW were compared to post-infusion values to determine if values normalized after intravenous iron infusion. Patient demographics including ethnicity, cause of IDA, prior oral iron treatments, and adverse effects of oral and IV iron were analyzed. Results: There were 33 subjects in this study. The average age of the subjects was 12.8 (+/- 5.1) years of age and 79% were female. The most prevalent indication for IV iron was menorrhagia (55%), while GI issues were 18% and insufficient diet accounted for 27%. The mean baseline HGB was 8.3 (+/- 1.7) while the mean final HGB increased to 11.5 (+/- 1.4) (p<0.001). The mean baseline MCV was 69.2 (+/- 9.3) and the mean last MCV was 76.1 (+/- 6.8) (p<0.001). The mean baseline RBC was 4.2 (+/- 0.82) and the mean last RBC was 4.9 (+/- 0.6) (p<0.001). Conclusion: IV iron sucrose infusions administered to pediatric outpatients were safe and effective in children and adolescents with IDA. Adherence to intravenous iron did not significantly improve. Hematologic parameters improved with infusions. Further analysis of patient demographics and characteristics of diagnosis needs to be performed to elucidate benefits of this therapy. As a single institution study, the results are limited to a regional patient population and their specific demographics. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
