    "abstract_text": "The Research on Adverse Drug Events and Reports project (RADAR) is one of only a few independent pharmacovigilance programs funded entirely by peer-reviewed grants. It is the only such program that focuses on serious adverse drug reactions (sADRs) related to hematology and oncology. RADAR leverages the resources of a comprehensive cancer center, an academic hematology/oncology program, and a global network of physicians. Since its inception in 1998, RADAR has identified 33 unique sADRs. Information about these sADRs are traditionally disseminated in peer-reviewed manuscripts (21 sADRs), warnings or black box warnings in FDA-approved package inserts or manufacturer warnings (12 sADRs), or Dear Doctor letters (8 sADRs). In the absence of formal collaborations between the FDA, drug manufacturers, and independent pharmacovigilance programs, RADAR has expanded its dissemination efforts to non-traditional strategies, such as face-to-face meetings with drug manufacturers (22 sADRs), which lead to further actions by regulatory agencies and stakeholders (Table). These actions have included revised clinical guidelines from NCCN, ASCO, ASH, and the American College of Radiology, FDA advisory hearings focusing on safety, the first ever drug safety focused citizen\u2019s petition filed by a state attorney general, and safety statements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Moving forward, RADAR is developing novel strategies for dissemination by partnering with Consumer Reports, the internet-based Medpedia Project, and monthly safety columns published in Community Oncology and Oncology News International.
