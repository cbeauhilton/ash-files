    "abstract_text": "Objective FThe DNA double strand breaks (DSB) in mammalian cells are predominantly repaired by a process called non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ). Ku70 played a pivotal role in NHEJ pathway. As a common hematological malignant disease with unique chromosomal translocation t (9;22), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) can be considered as a paradigm for neoplasias that evolve through a multi-step process. As we reported before, protein Ku70 expressed significantly higher in CML than in normal BM cells. Meanwhile, its expression level in blast phase was markedly higher than that in chronic phase. The present study furthermore aims to investigate the expression of the gene Ku70 in CML cells at different clinical stage and reveal the correlation among the expression of the gene Ku70, the protein Ku70 and BCR-ABL in cells of CML. The NHEJ efficiency to repair DSB in CML was also investigated. Methods: Bone marrow cells were collected from 24 cases of normal adults and 27 cases of de novo diagnosed CML patients. 15 CML patients were in chronic phase and 12 in blast phase. The expression of gene Ku70 was detected by RT-PCR and RQ-RT-PCR. The fusion gene BCR-ABL was detected by TaqMan probe Real Time PCR, using ABL as the internal control. Nucleic extracted proteins were used to determine NHEJ efficiency by an in vitro end-ligation system. Results: The mean level of NHEJ activity of normal BM cells and CML cells were 18.6\u00b113.1% vs 24.8\u00b114.9%, .024. The gene Ku 70 expression in normal BM cells and CML cells were 31.08\u00b18.41 vs 544.63\u00b11185.71 copies/10,000 \u03b2-Actin copies, P=0.039. gene Ku 70 expressed significantly higher in blast phase (1103.31\u00b11645.62 copies/10,000 \u03b2-Actin copies, P<0.01). There were positive correlations of BCR-ABL when compared with the expression of the gene Ku70 (r=0.573 P=0.002) and with the protein Ku70 (r=0.705 P<0.001) in CML cells. There was also significantly correlations between the expression of the gene Ku70 and the protein Ku70 (r=0. 808, P<0.001). Conclusions : The gene and protein of Ku70 were expressed significantly higher in CML than in normal BM cells with NHEJ activity was also enhanced in CML cells. Meanwhile, Ku70 expression level in acute phase was markedly higher than that in chronic phase. There were significantly correlations among the expression of fusion gene BCR-ABL, the gene Ku70 and the protein Ku70 in cells of CML This Study illustrates DNA instability in CML cells which was mainly damaged by DSB, and this kind of DNA damage was repaired by NHEJ pathway predominantly. NHEJ pathway plays an important role in disease progression of CML.",
