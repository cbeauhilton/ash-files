    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3276 Introduction: Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients have recurrent life-threating bacterial and fungal infections due to the mutation of one of four subunits of the respiratory burst oxidase (NADPH-oxidase). Currently, the overall fatality rate in CGD patients remains high, making it necessary to better understand the basic biological processes governing host defense against bacteria and fungi in CGD. Olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) is a neutrophil granule protein, which has been recently identified as a negative regulator of host innate immunity against bacteria infection in mice through modulation of neutrophil protease activity. The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of OLFM4 deletion on host innate immunity against Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus fumigatus , two major pathogens encountered in CGD patients, in a murine X-linked CGD model. Results: We created gp91 phox -and OLFM4-double deficient mice and investigated the mice defense against S. aureus and A. fumigatus infection. We found that neutrophil intracellular killing and in vivo clearance of S. aureus have been significantly increased in gp91 phox - and OLFM4-double deficiency mice compared with CGD mice. The mice survival to S. aureus sepsis in gp91 phox - and OLFM4-double deficiency mice has also been significantly prolonged compared with CGD mice. Our study has shown that the CGD mice immune deficiency against S. aureus has been totally corrected by additional loss of OLFM4 gene. To explore the mechanism that OLFM4 deletion rescued the bactericidal activities of CGD neutrophils, we analyzed cathepsin C and its downstream protease (neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G) activities in the mice neutrophils. Cathepsin C activities in OLFM4 deficient as well as double deficient mice neutrophils were significantly higher than those in WT mouse neutrophils. Cathepsin C activities in the neutrophils of CGD were similar to those in WT mice. Accordingly, the elastase and cathepsin G activities in the neutrophils of OLFM4 deficient and double deficient mice were also substantially higher than those in WT mice as well as CGD mice. However, we have not observed enhanced innate immunity against A. fumigatus in OLFM4 deficiency mice compared with wild-type mice using a lung infection model. The lung histopathology showed similar inflammation and fungal burden in the OLFM4 deficiency mice compared with wild-type mice. Correspondingly, mice survival to severe A. fumigatus infection did not show significant difference in gp91 phox - and OLFM4-double deficiency mice compared with CGD mice, suggesting that OLFM4 may not play a role in mice host defense against A. fumigatus . Conclusion: 1. The damaged neutrophil bacterial killing and host innate immunity against S. aureus in CGD mice due to oxidative mechanism deficiency could be successfully rescued by deletion of OLFM4. 2. These results showed that the granule protease activities in CGD neutrophils could be substantially enhanced above the level in normal neutrophils by deletion of OLFM4, suggesting that the increased of serine proteinase activities due to OLFM4 deletion is NADPH-independent. 3. OLFM4 may not play a role in mice host defense against pulmonary A. fumigatus infection. 4. OLFM4 might prove to be an important target in CGD patients to augment host defense against bacterial infection. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
