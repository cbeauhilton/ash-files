    "abstract_text": "Multiple Myeloma (MM) is still considered an incurable disease despite a substantial global outcome improvement observed during the past decade. Despite better understanding of biological pathways, availability of sophisticated diagnostic tools and increasing number of therapeutic options almost all patients experience disease relapse. The aim of our retrospective study was to analyze global outcome in newly diagnosed MM patients eligible for high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) treated in our Institution in the last 15 years. We evaluated 177 MM patients transplanted in our Institution from November 1999 to February 2015. Median age at start therapy was 58 years (range 36-71) and median follow up time (from start therapy to last follow up) was 52 months (range 7-185). Patients received different induction therapies before transplant reflecting the availability of new drugs and consequently more therapeutic choices. 65 patients received conventional chemotherapy-based induction (VAD 27, 15%, Total Therapy 2-like 37, 22%, EDAP 1 patient); 15 patients thalidomide-based (TD, 8%); 88 patients bortezomib-based (VTD 74, 43%; VCD 8, 5%; PAD 3, 1%; VD 3, 1%) and 9 patients lenalidomide-based (RD, 5%). After induction regimen 23 patients (13%) received additional therapy before transplant: 14 for Progressive Disease (PD), 9 were considered in suboptimal/unsatisfactory response (5 in Partial Response, PR and 4 in Stable Disease, SD). 71 patients received a single ASCT, 106 patients double ASCT; 11 tandem autologous and allogeneic SCT. All patients had a PR/VGPR/CR after ASCT. Treatment related mortality was 1% (3 patients: 2 of them after Allogenic ASCT, 1 for acute Graft versus Host Disease, 1 for Veno Occlusive Disease). After first line therapy 7 patients died: 3 for progressive disease, 4 for other causes (2 myocardial infarction, 1 intestinal ischemia and 1 breast cancer). 90 patients (51%) experienced MM relapse (median time from ASCT 24 months) and were treated according to different chemotherapy schedules. At last follow-up 115 patients were alive (65%), 61 of them in Complete Response, 31 in Very Good Partial Response, 8 in Partial Response, 4 in SD, 11 in PD. Median global overall survival (OS) was 109 months, median global Progression Free Survival1 (PFS1) 51 months and median global PFS2 (time from start therapy to second disease progression or death from any cause) 80 months. According to different induction therapy (chemotherapy vs bortezomib vs thalidomide vs lenalidomide-based) median OS was 117 months vs not reached (more than 96) vs 68 vs not reached (more than 60); median PFS1 was 47 months vs 60 vs 35 vs not reached (more than 60); median PFS2 was 76 months vs 92 vs 57 vs not reached (more than 60), respectively. As reported in literature the improvement of biological, diagnostic and clinical knowledge and the availability of new therapeutic tools translates in improved outcome in MM patients treated in our Center. The introduction of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in the induction therapy gave the best results in terms of OS, control of the disease (PFS) and response to second line therapy after relapse (PFS2). Considering the remarkable progress done in the past decade the dream of a cure is a challenge for the future. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
