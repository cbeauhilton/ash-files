    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody Daratumumab is highly effective against multiple myeloma, is well tolerated, and has high single agent activity as well as combination effects with lenalidomide-dexamethasone as well as bortezomib-dexamethasone. Patient response to daratumumab monotherapy is highly correlated with pretreatment levels of CD38 expression on MM plasma cells (Nijhof et al, Leukemia (2015) 29:2039) and CD38 loss is correlated with daratumumab resistance (Nijhof et al, Blood (2016) 128:959). As a result, there is significant interest in elucidating the regulation and role of CD38 in MM. Recently, All Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA), a known small molecule inducer of CD38 in myeloid cells, as well as the FDA-approved histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat, were both demonstrated to induce CD38 in MM plasma cells leading to increased lysis by daratumumab. Examining ENCODE data, we found the presence of a CpG island at the first exon of CD38 . We hypothesized that removing methylation sites from this CpG island may de-repress CD38 transcription and lead to increased CD38 protein at the cell surface in MM plasma cells. Therefore, here we studied the role of DNA methyl-transferase inhibitors (DNMTis), currently FDA-approved for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, as agents to potentiate daratumumab therapy. Methods: We treated MM cell lines (RPMI-8226, MM.1S, XG-1, KMS12-PE) with two different DNMTis, 5-Azacytidine and decitabine, and assessed CD38 cell surface expression by flow cytometry. Similarly, we treated MM patient bone marrow aspirates ex vivo and assessed induction of CD38 expression in the CD138 positive population by flow cytometry. We analyzed CD38 mRNA levels and total CD38 protein levels by qRT-PCR and western blotting respectively. ATRA was used as a positive control in all experiments. We further tested the functional effect of DNMTi treatment on MM cell lines using an Antibody Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay. Briefly, live treated cells were incubated overnight with daratumumab and NK92-CD16 transgenic cells at and E:T ratio of 20:1, and lysis was measured using CytoTox-Glo (Promega). Results: Flow analysis revealed that DNMTi treatment induces a 1.2-2 fold increase in CD38 surface protein expression in a dose-dependent manner across MM cell lines. DNMTi treatment consistently yielded similar or higher increases in CD38 expression than that seen in ATRA- or panobinostat-treated cells. Despite significantly lower single-agent cytotoxicity, we found that decitabine led to similar surface CD38 induction as 5-Azacytidine. By RT-qPCR, 5-Azacytidine increased CD38 mRNA expression ~3 fold versus DMSO control, compared to ~2 fold mRNA increase with ATRA. In functional ADCC assays, DNMTi treatment also led to greater lysis than ATRA. Furthermore, the combination of both DNMTi and ATRA was additive, leading to the greatest lysis by NK cells. In contrast, in ex vivo -treated patient samples, ATRA induced greater CD38 expression than 5-Azacytidine on malignant plasma cells. However, this result is expected since MM plasma cells from patients typically do not proliferate in standard ex vivo culture, and active DNA replication is a requirement for successful DNMT inhibition based on known mechanism of action. In patients, however, we anticipate that continual plasma cell proliferation will lead to effective increases in CD38 after DNMTi treatment, as found in MM cell lines here. Summary and Conclusions: Our results here demonstrate that CD38 expression in MM cells is regulated by DNA methylation and targeting DNMTs with small molecule inhibitors leads to increased vulnerability to Daratumumab treatment. We propose that combination treatment with DNMTi and Daratumumab can lead to higher efficacy of daratumumab in daratumumab-na\u00efve MM, as well as reversal of daratumumab-resistance. These combinations should be tested in clinical trials. Disclosures Wiita: Sutro Biopharma: Research Funding; TeneoBio: Research Funding.",
