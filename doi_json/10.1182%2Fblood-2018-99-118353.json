    "abstract_text": "Background: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the main contributor to myocardial infarction, is a thrombotic complication of atherosclerosis. Growing evidence supports a role for the intrinsic coagulation cascade in various thrombotic diseases. To gain more inside in the contribution of the intrinsic coagulation cascade in an ACS, we developed novel, ELISA-based assays for the quantification of Kallikrein, activated factor XII (FXIIa), FXIa, FXa, FIXa, and thrombin in complex with a physiological inhibitor. Methods: During this prospective cohort study, blood from patients with a first ACS (n=61) was collected upon admission (before heparin injection(t=0), and after 1(t=1) and 6 (t=2) months. Plasma levels of Kallikrein-C1inhibitor (K-C1inh), FXIIa-C1inh, FXIa-C1inh, FXIa-\u03b11 anti trypsin, FXIa-antithrombin (AT), FIXa-AT, FXa-AT, and thrombin-AT(TAT) were measured using newly developed ELISA's and compared to apparently healthy controls (n=60). Methods were validated according to the EP5-protocol for within- and -between run variability. Results: The inter coefficients of variability for K-C1inh is 11.9%, FXIa-\u03b11-AT 14.4%, FXIa-AT 13.7%, FIXa-AT 4.9%, FXa-AT 2.6% and TAT 8.6 %. Levels of FXIa-\u03b11-AT, FXI- \u0391\u03a4, FIXa-AT and TAT were all significantly elevated in plasma from ACS patients at time of the acute event compared to healthy control: FXIa-\u03b11 anti trypsin respectively 202.8 (IQR 156.6 - 283.4) vs 29.0 pM (IQR 0.00 - 101.0); FXIa-AT levels were respectively 35.9 pM (IQR 23.9 - 43.4) vs 28.0 pM (IQR 23.3 - 34.0); FIXa-AT respectively 102.0pM (IQR 87.4 - 123.0) vs 90.5 pM (IQR 83.2 - 104.3); TAT respectively 5.59 (IQR 3.91 - 9.85) vs 2.26 pM (IQR 1.78 - 2.71)(Fig1). Plasma levels of FXIa-\u03b11-AT, FXIa-AT FIXa-AT, and TAT decreased during follow up. Additionally, FXIa-\u03b11-AT, FXIa-AT FIXa-AT, and TAT were higher in patients with ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) compared to subjects with non-STEMI or angina pectoris. Conclusion: Elisa based profiling of the coagulation proteases provide a highly sensitive and reproducible method used to distinguish the different activation states of single proteases in the coagulation cascade. With these novel assays we show that FXIa-\u03b11-AT, FXIa-AT FIXa-AT, and TAT are significantly elevated in patients with ACS. Additionally, patients with STEMI have a more pronounced hypercoagulable state than non-STEMI and angina pectoris patients. Figure 1. View large Download slide Figure 1.
