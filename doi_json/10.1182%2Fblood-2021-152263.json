    "abstract_text": "Relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has poor long-term survival even after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Several studies supported that CAR-T therapy followed by allo-HSCT is benefit for improving long-term leukemia free survival (LFS). Since probably a stronger graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect of unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT), it is uncertain whether consolidative UCBT is suitable for R/R B-ALL after CAR-T therapy. Here, we conducted a retrospective comparative study for R/R B-ALL patients receiving UCBT in our transplantation center. Totally 43 cases with R/R B-ALL who underwent UCBT were assigned to CAR-T group (patients achieved CR or CRi by CAR-T cell therapy before bridging to UCBT, n = 21) or non-remission (NR) group (n = 22). The median time from CAR-T infusion to UCBT was 62 (range, 42-185) days. All patients achieved neutrophil engraftment by day 42 in CAR-T group. The 180-day cumulative incidence of platelet engraftment was higher in CAR-T group than in NR group (90.5% vs 65.7%, P = 0.16). Incidence of grade II-IV and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were 28.6% and 23.8% in CAR-T group, which were both tendency lower than in NR group (45.5% and 31.8%, P = 0.32 and P = 0.63, respectively). No patient suffered from extensive chronic GVHD in CAR-T group, which was lower than in NR group (9.1%, P = 0.23). Lower 2-year cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM), and higher probabilities of 2-year overall survival, leukemia free survival (LFS), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free relapse-free survival (GRFS) were found in CAR-T group (4.8% vs 28.2%; 75.0% vs 37.7%; 49.8% vs 23.0%; 42.4% vs 14.8%; P = 0.037, 0.005, 0.028 and 0.017; respectively). However, 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse was comparably high between CAR-T and NR group (26.7% vs 38.3%; P = 0.41). CAR-T therapy followed by UCBT has a superior survival for R/R B-ALL, but remains relatively high post-transplant relapse rate. Prevention of relapse after UCBT is warranted in this patient cohort.
