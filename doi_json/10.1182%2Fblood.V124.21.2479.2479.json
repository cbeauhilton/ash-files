    "abstract_text": "Double umbilical cord blood (dUCB) allogeneic transplantation following low dose TBI, cyclophosphamide and Fludarabine (TCF regimen)-based reduced-intensity conditioning regimen (RIC) is increasingly used in adults lacking a suitable related or unrelated donor. Currently, there is little data regarding the impact on long-term outcome of CD3+ T cell chimerism (TCC) in this particular setting. Thirty-six adults with various hematological diseases and who receieved dUCB conditioned with TCF were included in this retrospective study. Peripheral blood CD3+ TCC was considered until day +100 post-tranplant in order to determine the impact of full versus mixed chimerism on long-term outcomes. Twenty-nine and 7 patients were documented with full and mixed CD3+ TCC, respectively, within the first 100 days post-transplant. With a median follow-up of 36 months, 3 year-OS, DFS, and relapse incidence were 61%, (95% CI 43-75); 50% (95% CI 32.5-66) and 28% (95% CI 16-44), respectively. In univariate analysis, a full CD3+ TCC was associated with a better 3-year DFS : 59% (95% CI 39-75.5) versus 14% (95% CI 7-46), (HR=0.24 [0.09-0.65], p=0.005) and a lower cumulative incidence of relapse : 24% (95% CI 21.5-57) versus 78% (95% CI 52-99), (HR=0.18 [0.05-0.5], p=0.004). In multivariate analysis, a full CD3+ TCC remained associated with a lower incidence or relapse (HR=0.17, 95% CI 0.028-0.99, p=0.049). CD3+ TCC has no impact on GVHD and NRM in this study. In conclusion, in our study, full CD3+ TCC was independently associated with a lower risk of relapse after dUCB TCF RIC allogeneic transplant in adults, highlighting the need to develop immunotherapy approaches allowing for early conversion to full chimerism after dUCB.
