    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4559 Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a cytokine produced primarily by the liver and kidney that regulates platelet production by stimulating proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells, megakaryocytic progenitor cells and megakaryocytes via activation of its receptor, c-Mpl. Recently, TPO receptor agonists such as eltrombopag and romiplostim have been approved for chronic ITP. huVB22B was created as a novel humanized form of murine sc(Fv) 2VB22B minibody (BLOOD, 2005) which activates human c-Mpl by CDR grafting. The advent of these various TPO receptor agonists prompted us to consider the differences in their mechanisms of action, efficacy or potency. However, to date, there has been no in vivo or in vitro study directly comparing the effects of different TPO receptor agonists. In this study, we compared the efficacy of huVB22B on CFU-GM, CFU-E, CFU-Megakaryocyte (CFU-MK), megakaryocyte maturation (DNA ploidy and proplatelet formation) with those of recombinant human TPO (rhTPO) and eltrombopag. Primary human CD34+ bone marrow cells were cultured with various concentrations of rhTPO, huVB22B and eltrombopag using methylcellulose based media. In serum-free condition, 0.286 nM rhTPO, 0.182 nM huVB22B and 17.7 mcM eltrombopag demonstrated almost equivalent efficacy of megakaryocyte colony formation. At these concentrations, all agents demonstrated similar in vitro efficacy for colony formation of CFU-GM and CFU-E, proplatelet formation and nuclear maturation of megakaryocytes. In preliminary results, huVB22B induced maturation of CFU-MK earlier than rhTPO and eltrombopag, suggesting that huVB22B might have some potential to increase human platelets faster than other agents in vivo. This is compatible with the observation that huVB22B induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, STAT5 and JAK2 faster and stronger than rhTPO and eltrombopag in human primary platelets. Both rhTPO and huVB22B enhanced low-dose ADP and collagen-induced human platelet aggregation in vitro. In contrast, eltrombopag did not enhance ADP or collagen-induced platelet aggregation, although it induced activation of JAK-STAT pathway in human platelets. Contrary to the fact that huVB22B induces phosphorylation of intracellular signaling molecules faster and stronger than rhTPO in human platelets, the priming effect by huVB22B on platelet aggregation was much weaker than rhTPO. In conclusion, we confirmed that newly created huVB22B minibody induced colony formation of CFU-MK, CFU-E, CFU-GM and maturation of megakaryocytes from human bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells in vitro. The differences among TPO receptor agonists observed in our study would lead to further understanding of the basic biology of megakaryopoiesis and the action of TPO receptor agonists.
