    "abstract_text": "The aim of our study was to determine whether ex vivo expansion of umbilical cord blood (UCB) progenitor cells induces changes in their capacity to generate immune cells. CD34 + CB cells were cultured for 14 days with SCF, FLT3-l, TPO and G-CSF, inducing a total cells, CD34 + and LTC-ICs increase of 1500, 120 and 8 fold respectively. Non expanded (d0) and 14-day expanded (d14) CD34 + cells were compared for their capacity to produce T lymphocytes (TLs) using the fetal thymus organ culture system and DCs generated from d0 and d14 CD34 + cells were compared for their differentiation, phenotype and function. Total percentages of CD4 + , CD4 + CD8 \u2212 and CD4 + CD8 + TLs obtained from d0 and d14 CD34 + cells were comparable. In both fractions, most of the CD4 + T cells co-expressed iCD3 but a lower proportion of d14 derived TLs expressed sCD3. However, there was no significant difference between d0 and d14 derived TLs in term of Vb chain representation, all TCR-Vb chains examined being represented in each case. These data indicate that d0 and d14 CD34 + cells have a similar capacity to generate TLs and that expansion does not induced any skewing of the TCR-Vb repertoire. D0 and d14 CD34 + cells were next cultured with SCF, FL, GM-CSF and TNF-a to compare their capacity to differentiate into DCs. Similar percentages of CD1a + DCs expressing the same levels of HLA-DR and co stimulatory molecules were obtained. DCs derived from d14 CD34 + cells were less potent to stimulate allogeneic TLs, but the pattern of cytokines produced by stimulated TLs was similar and no shift towards a predominant Th1 or Th2 response was observed. Moreover, in spite of a quantitative increase (15 fold) related to the CD34 pool amplification, we observed a decreased capacity (13-fold) of d14 cells to generate DCs compared to d0 CD34 + cells. Overall, these results indicate that ex vivo expansion of CD34 + cells doesn\u2019t induce any major modification in T Lymphopoiesis capacity while alters somehow the capacity of the graft to generate DCs. We discuss in the context of UCB transplantation, the putative interest of co-infusion of expanded and non expanded fractions in view of improving myelopoiesis in the graft without subverting the immune reconstitution.",
