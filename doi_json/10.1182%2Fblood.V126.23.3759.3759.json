    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are stratified at diagnosis based on molecular/cytogenetic characteristics and their response to initial treatment to receive risk-adapted multi-agent chemotherapy. The majority of ALL patients are stratified as Intermediate Risk (IR) and present with moderate levels of minimal residual disease (MRD<5x104) after receiving induction therapy, although an unacceptably high proportion of these patients relapse. The lack of specific prognostic features makes it difficult to predict the response of IR patients to treatment. The early identification of patients who are destined to relapse would facilitate improvements in tailored treatments for IR ALL patients. Recent progress in the development of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) in immune-deficient mice represents an opportunity to improve relapse prediction in ALL patients. The aims of this study were to: (1) optimize the engraftment conditions of IR pediatric ALL samples to predict patient response to treatment; and, (2) to assess the development and mechanisms of therapy-induced drug resistance. Methods: Two pairs of IR pediatric ALL patients were matched based on clinical and genetic features, except that one patient from each pair relapsed early while the other remains relapse-free (ALL-Rel and ALL-CR1, respectively). Three parameters were varied in establishing PDXs by inoculating one million bone marrow (BM) derived biopsy cells collected at diagnosis into groups of 4 mice: (1) mouse strain (NOD/SCID vs. NSG); (2) site of inoculation (intravenous vs. intra-femoral); and (3) early treatment of mice with a 2-week induction chemotherapy regimen of vincristine, dexamethasone, and L-asparaginase (VXL). Leukemia engraftment was monitored weekly based on the proportion of human versus mouse CD45+ cells in the murine PB, and the median times to engraftment were compared according to patient outcome. The median time to engraft was also compared between the VXL-treated and non-treated groups. PDXs harvested from mice were compared for ex vivo sensitivity to single agent vincristine, dexamethasone and L-asparaginase. PDX gene expression profiles were also compared to identify pathways associated with evasion of VXL treatment in vivo. Results: The efficiency of engraftment was greater for NSG mice (29/32 mice engrafted) versus NOD/SCID mice (20/32 mice), and primary ALL cells also engrafted significantly faster in NSG mice (median time to engraft 71.1 days) compared with NOD/SCID mice (83.5 days) (P < 0.01), with no apparent difference associated with clinical outcome. Intrafemoral inoculation did not improve the efficiency or speed of engraftment compared with intravenous inoculation, nor predicted clinical outcome. However, PDX responses to VXL induction chemotherapy reflected the clinical outcome of the patients from whom they were derived; those derived from the 2 ALL-Rel patients exhibited in vivo drug resistance (leukemia growth delay of 1 and 6.2 days) compared with those derived from the 2 ALL-CR1 patients (34.7 and >119.8 days). Further, ex vivo analysis showed that the PDXs derived from the ALL-Rel patients exhibited resistance to vincristine or L-asparaginase compared with those derived from the ALL-CR1 cases. Moreover, the in vivo VXL treatment of an ALL-CR1 PDX resulted in selection of cells that exhibited vincristine resistance. Gene expression profiling revealed significant up-regulation of microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) and tubulin isotypes (alpha and beta) in vincristine-resistant PDXs. Genes that were significantly upregulted in vincristine resistant PDXs with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and P value < 0.02 include TUBB6, TUBA1A, TUBA1B, MAP1S, TUBA3D and TBCA. The increased expression of genes that affect microtubule functions suggest that changes in microtubule dynamics and/or stability led to decreased sensitivity to antimicrotubule agents. Conclusions: In vivo selection of PDXs with an induction-type regimen of chemotherapeutic drugs may lead to improved relapse prediction and identify novel mechanisms of drug resistance in IR pediatric ALL.
