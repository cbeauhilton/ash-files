    "abstract_text": "Background Cancer associated inflammation is one of the key determinants of outcome in patients with cancer. An elevated neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been identified as a predictor of worse survival in patients with various solid tumors compared to hematologic malignancies but no reports yet examined its impact on multiple myeloma. The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic value of an elevated NLR in multiple myeloma. Methods We had approval by our institutional review board to collect the data on patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma at Staten Island University Hospital between year 2000 and 2012 identified from our local cancer database. Data on demographics, conventional prognostic markers, laboratory analyzes including blood count results, and histopathology were collected and analyzed. A cox proportional survival analysis was carried out to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality. NLR was assessed as a continuous variable as well as categorical variable (quartile 0.5-1.5, 1.6-2.2, 2.3-3.8, and 3.9-22.3). Results A total of 96 patients were identified with a median age at diagnosis of 70 (IQR of 61 to 79) years. The median neutrophil count was 3.5 (2.5\u20145.1) x 10 -9 /liters, median lymphocyte count 1.5 (1.05-2.4) \u00d7 10 -9 /liters, while the NLR was 2.28 (1.53-3.88). The median overall survival was 147.5 weeks, IQR (88.5-320). NLR did not prove to be a significant predictor of death as a continuous variable (0.95 (0.85-1.06), p =0.35). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in survival with any of the quartiles of NLR. Compare to lowest quartile of NLR, Hazards ratio for the consecutive quartiles were 1.25 (0.56-2.79, p 0.55), 1.36 (0.61-3.04, p=0.45) and 0.89 (0.36-2.22, p=0.80). Conclusion NLR does not appear to offer useful predictive ability for outcome and survival in multiple myeloma patients. Our study is limited with small sample size, further studies are needed to validate our results. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
