    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4829 The role of TIF1\u03b3 in hematopoiesis is still incompletely understood. We previously identified TIF1\u03b3 as a novel binding factor for Smad2/3 in the Transforming Growth Factor-\u03b2 (TFG\u03b2)-inducible signaling pathway implicated in the enhancement of erythropoiesis. To investigate the function of TIF1\u03b3 in regulation of hematopoietic stem cells we abrogated TIF1\u03b3 signaling by shRNA gamma-retroviral gene transfer in human umbilical cord blood-derived CD34+ hematopoietic stem/ progenitor cells (HCS/ HPCs). Upon blocking TIF1\u03b3 the self-renewal capacity of HSCs was enhanced two-fold in vitro as measured by week 5 CAFC assay and three-fold in vivo as measured by competitive engraftment in NOD/ SCID mice over controls. This was associated with a delay in erythroid differentiation and enhanced myelopoiesis. These changes were predominantly observed after TIF1\u03b3 knockdown and only mildly after Smad2 depletion but not after Smad3 or 4 reduction. Our data reveal a role for TIF1\u03b3-mediated signaling in the regulation of HSC self-renewal and differentiation. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
