    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2512 Background: FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ( FLT3 ) internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations ( FLT3 ITD+) result in constitutive activation of this receptor and have been shown to increase the risk of relapse in patients (pts) with AML; however, substantial heterogeneity in clinical outcomes still exists within both the FLT3 ITD+ and FLT3 ITD- AML subgroups, suggesting alternative mechanisms of disease relapse not accounted for by FLT3 mutational status. Single Cell Network Profiling (SCNP) is a multiparametric flow cytometry-based assay that simultaneously measures, in a quantitative fashion and at the single cell level, both extracellular surface marker levels and changes in intracellular signaling proteins in response to extracellular modulators (Kornblau et al. Clin Cancer Res 2010). Previously, we reported the use of this assay to functionally characterize FLT3 receptor signaling in healthy bone marrow and AML samples (Rosen et al. PLoS One 2010). By applying it to a separate cohort of samples collected from elderly non-M3 AML pts at diagnosis, a subclassification of AML samples beyond their \u201cstatic\u201d molecular FLT3 ITD status was generated (Rosen et al. ASH 2010 Abstr 2739). Specifically, FLT3 ITD- AML samples displayed a wide range of induced signaling, with a fraction having signaling profiles comparable to FLT3 ITD+ AML samples. Conversely, FLT3 ITD+ AML samples displayed more homogeneous induced signaling, with the exception of those with low mutational load, which had profiles more analogous to FLT3 ITD- AML samples. Due to the small numbers of pts in that exploratory study (n=44 [38 FLT3 ITD- and 6 FLT3 ITD+ pts]), an independent study was undertaken to confirm the observations, as well as to evaluate their clinical relevance (i.e., association with disease free survival (DFS) following anthracycline/cytarabine-based induction therapy). Methods: SCNP was performed as previously described on cryopreserved bone marrow or peripheral blood samples collected prior to anthracycline/cytarabine-based induction therapy from 104 elderly (>60y) non-M3 AML pts enrolled on ECOG trial 3999 or 3993 for whom ITD mutational status (including % mutational load), response and DFS data were available. Samples included 85 FLT3 ITD- and 19 FLT3 ITD+ AML, 30 and 8 of which, respectively, were collected from patients who achieved complete remission (CR). Objectives: The primary study objective was to confirm that levels of FLT3 ligand (FLT3L)-induced signaling (as measured by changes in intracellular phospho-S6 level) are more homogeneous in FLT3 ITD+ than in FLT3 ITD- myeloblasts. Four FLT3 ITD+ groups were pre-defined based on % mutation load (>0, 30%, 40%, or 50%). In addition, FLT3 ITD mutational status and signaling data from the SCNP assay (FLT3L and stem cell factor-induced phospho-S6 signaling and cytarabine/daunorubicin-induced apoptosis [cleaved PARP]) were combined to mathematically model their association with DFS among pts who achieved CR. DFS was defined as time from date of confirmed CR to date of relapse or death. Results: As shown in Figure 1a , our previous observations that variance in FLT3L-induced signaling is higher in FLT3 ITD- AML samples than in FLT3 ITD+ ones and that variance is decreased with increasing mutational load were verified in this study (Levene Test for FLT3 ITD- vs FLT3 ITD+ 50 p value=0.023). Further, when the association of DFS with FLT3 ITD mutational status and signaling data from the SCNP assay was measured using a Cox Proportional-Hazards model, the SCNP data were shown to provide independent information from FLT3 ITD mutational status (p =0.0115 for FLT3L-induced phospho-S6 signaling, Figure 1b ).

Functional characterization of FLT3 receptor signaling deregulation using SCNP provides prognostic information independent from FLT3 ITD mutational status and allows for more accurate pt stratification by functionally defining DFS risk sub-groups. Characterization of FLT3 signaling deregulation by SCNP could ultimately aid in the improved clinical management of AML pts and help identify candidates for FLT3 receptor inhibitor studies.
