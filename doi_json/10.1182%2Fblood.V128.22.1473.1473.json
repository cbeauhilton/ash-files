    "abstract_text": "In vivo reconstitution studies have established the phenotype of murine CLP, a progenitor population with restricted developmental potential for T, NK, B lymphoid and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) lineages. Co-transplantation of murine CLP with purified HSC more rapidly restores lymphopoiesis, immune function and resistance to viral challenge in experimental models of HSC transplantation. Thus, the identification of human CLP would have translational impact in clinical HSCT. Based on the expression of IL-7R\u03b1 (CD127) as a key distinguishing marker of murine CLP, we studied the CD127+ subset of immature CD34+ Lin- CD38+ cells for lymphoid committed progenitors, comprising approximately 0.1-0.2% of total marrow. Like murine CLP, the CD34+ Lin- CD38+ CD127+ cells also expressed Kit and Flt3. OP9 stromal cells were transduced with a vector expressing a doxycycline inducible delta-like ligand 1 (dll1) gene to test the differentiation potential in a single-well switch culture. Progenitors co-cultured with uninduced OP9\u0394dll1 cells can differentiate into B and myeloid cells; after induction of dll1, the culture is permissive for T and NK differentiation in the same well. In the presence of Kit and Flt3 ligands, erythromyeloid growth factors (IL-6, IL-3, GM-CSF, EPO, TPO) and lymphoid factors (IL-7, IL-15), CD34+ Lin- CD38- CD127- HSC generated erythroid (E), myelomonocytic (MM), myeloid DC (mDC), T, NK, and B lymphocytes and pDC. In contrast, CD34+ Lin- CD38+ CD127+ cells generated T/NK/B/pDC progeny, distributed in varying proportions, but did not generate E/MM/mDC. Singly plated CD34+ Lin- CD38+ CD127+ cells generate T/NK/B cells in the same well, consistent with these cells being human CLP. CD34+ Lin- CD38+ CD127- \"non-CLP\" generated E/MM/mDC, but not T/NK/B/pDC progeny. Limiting dilution analyses under lymphoid conditions demonstrated that the CD34+ Lin- CD38+ CD127+ CLP had approximately 2-3-fold greater efficiency of lymphocyte generation than HSC under the same conditions. Transcriptional profiling of the human CLP showed patterns of gene expression distinct from that of HSC, CD34+ Lin- CD38+ CD127- progenitors and immature CD3-CD4-CD8- thymocytes. Approximately 50% of the CD34+ Lin- CD38+ CD127+ CLP also express CD10, a subpopulation which CyTOF analyses revealed to have other markers of B-cell commitment and/or differentiation, e.g., CD179a. Human CD34+ Lin- CD38+ CD127+ marrow cells are a unique multipotent, lymphoid-restricted progenitor population for T/NK/B/pDC cell development, and within which subsets of cells biased for individual lymphoid lineages may exist. Identification of human CLP will permit further analyses of lymphoid specification, commitment to lymphoid lineages, and potential adoptive transfer as a short-term source of polyclonal lymphocytes.
