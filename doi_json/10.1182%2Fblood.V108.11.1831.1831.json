    "abstract_text": "Bcr-Abl kinase domain (KD) point mutations are detected in the dominant clone(s) in approximately 45% of CML at the time of disease resistance, developing after an average of 20\u201335 months of imatinib therapy. However, low numbers of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)+ tumor cells with KD mutations could be present at earlier timepoints providing a pool of potential resistant subclones. Since current therapy of Ph+ ALL relies on imatinib maintenance therapy, the pattern of Bcr-Abl KD mutations in this tumor is an important and understudied phenomenon. We assessed the frequency and levels of Bcr-Abl KD mutations at different points in ALL, including at diagnosis, upon relapse and following salvage therapy with kinase inhibitors. We performed Bcr-Abl KD mutational analysis by direct sequencing in 25 cases of Ph+ ALL at the time of diagnosis and 25 cases upon disease persistence/relapse. For comparison, we analyzed 22 cases of lymphoid blast crisis of CML (LyBC), most of which transformed following long-term imatinib monotherapy. To track the emergence of mutated clones, we also performed more sensitive analysis for the T315I mutation by pyrosequencing (5% sensitivity) and allele-specific oligonucleotide probe (ASO) PCR (1:500 sensitivity). KD mutations were not seen by direct sequencing in ALL cases at diagnosis. The T315I mutation was also not detected by pyrosequencing (n =25) or ASO-PCR (n = 10) in newly diagnosed ALL. In contrast, Bcr-Abl KD mutations (Y253H in 3, Q252H, T315I, F317L, E355Q, H396R in 1 each) were seen in 8 of 25 (32%) relapsed/persistent ALL, occurring in patients who had been receiving imatinib for a median of 14 months (range 2\u201326). An additional 3 patients treated with dasatinib or nilotinib for relapse subsequently developed KD mutations (T315I and Y253H, and F317L) after 1, 4 and 9 months of second therapy. KD mutations were seen in 16 of 22 (73%) patients with lymphoid blast crisis, including T315I in 7, E255K and M244V in 2 each, and Y253H, V299L, F311I, E355G, F359V in 1 each. All KD mutations in LyBC developed following imatinib or nilotinib therapy. As with CML, kinase inhibitor therapy particularly in the relapse/salvage setting is the primary risk factor for emergence of Bcr-Abl KD mutations in Ph+ ALL. There is a high frequency of Bcr-Abl KD mutations associated the lymphoid transformation of CML. However, Bcr-Abl KD mutations develop more rapidly in persistent or relapsed Ph+ ALL than in CML and there is a higher frequency of Y253H mutations noted. These findings will likely have consequences for the timing and dosages of imatinib and other kinase inhibitors in maintenance and relapsed ALL regimens.",
