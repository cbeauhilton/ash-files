    "abstract_text": "Background: We have previously described a resistance to the normal process of apoptosis in neutrophils of patients with myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM) ( Blood  2003 ; 102 : 11 ). Most recently, an activating mutation of JAK2 (V617F) has been described in approximately half of the patients with MMM as well as in variable proportion of patients with other myeloproliferative disorders (MPD). In the current study, we investigated the correlation between JAK2 V617F mutation status and neutrophil apoptosis in MMM. Methods: Neutrophils were isolated by density centrifugation from patients with MMM, other MPDs, and normal controls and assessed for apoptosis at baseline and after 24 hours in culture (IMDM with 20% sterilized fetal calf serum to simulate spontaneous apoptosis). Apoptosis was quantified using three-color flow cytometry using CD45 (to confirm leukocyte presence), annexin V (AN) (marker of apoptosis; detects aberrant externalization of phosphatidylserine during apoptosis), and propidium iodide (PI) (marker of dead cells). Mutation analysis for JAK2 V617F was performed in DNA derived from the isolated neutrophils using genomic DNA amplified by PCR, or extracted from cytogenetic pellets in archived specimens. Apoptotic rates after 24 hours in culture were correlated between patients and controls for both JAK2 mutation status and clinical parameters. Immunoblotting was performed on a subset of patients for correlation of JAK2 mutation status and downstream phosphorylation of the JAK2 target, STAT3, which transcriptionally activates several antiapoptotic genes. Results: Spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis was significantly decreased in MMM patients (n=50; median % apoptotic cells at 41%) compared to both healthy volunteers (n=9; 66%) and patients with other MPD (n=11; 53%) (p=0.002). Resistance to apoptosis in MMM correlated with both anemia (p=0.01) and the presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation (p=0.01). Furthermore, the specific abnormality was more pronounced in patients with homozygous JAK2 V617F; median % apoptotic cells of 47% for patients with wild-type allele (n=22) vs. 39% for heterozygotes (n=23) vs. 22% for homozygotes (n=5; p=0.008). The JAK2 mutation status did not appear dependent on other peripheral blood or clinical features. Neutrophils from 14 MMM patients were assessed simultaneously for both JAK2 mutation and STAT3 phosphorylation status by immunoblotting. Strong expression of phosphorylation of STAT3 was seen in all 3 homozygotes and 4 of 5 heterozygotes, but only 1 of 6 with wild-type allele (p=0.026). Conclusions: Impaired neutrophil apoptosis in patients with MMM correlates with the functional presence of JAK2 V617F in an allele-dose dependent manner and STAT3 phosphorylation. The current observation supports a pathogenetic role for the specific mutation in sustaining clonal myeloproliferation.",
