    "abstract_text": "Deregulated microRNA (miRNA) expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We previously showed that miR-193b is a STAT5-regulated miRNA that controls hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) expansion by modulating cytokine receptor signaling. Here we demonstrate that the miR-193 family members miR-193a and 193b are potent tumor suppressors in AML. Both miRNAs were downregulated in several cytogenetically-defined subgroups of pediatric and adult AML (n=202), whereas low miR-193b expression was an independent indicator for poor prognosis and survival. Accordingly, ectopic retroviral Hoxa9-Meis1 expression in HSPCs from miR-193b -/- mice resulted in a more aggressive disease with significantly shortened latency and survival as compared to miR-193b WT/WT HSPCs. Inversely, ectopic miR-193 expression in leukemic cells belonging to various AML subgroups decreased leukemic growth in vitro and prolonged survival of mice suffering from Hoxa9-Meis1-induced leukemia through a G1/S phase block . These effects were mediated by targeting c-KIT , KRAS and SOS2 - key factors of the KIT-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade - as well as the downstream cell cycle regulator CCND1 . Knockdown of each of these genes partially recapitulated the anti-proliferative effect of ectopic lentiviral miR-193 expression. As the tumor suppressive function is independent of patient age or AML cytogenetic background, these observations suggest an opportunistic role for miR-193 in future AML therapies. With the notion that a single miRNA can control aberrant MAPK signaling at multiple levels, restoring miR-193 expression in AML cells with constitutive activation of this cascade would assure high antileukemic efficacy, while avoiding the fast development of resistance mechanisms.
