    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2761 Poster Board II-737 IL-21 is a cytokine produced by CD4 cells that has diverse effects on the immune system. In CLL, IL-21 has been shown to promote apoptosis when tumor cells express the IL-21 receptor-\u03b1 (IL21R-\u03b1). A phase I trial with IL-21 + Rituximab had promising clinical activity in a small number of relapsed CLL patients, including one patient who attained a sustained molecular complete remission, sustained for 4+ years. Expression of IL21R-\u03b1 is variable between CLL patients, and this expression has been shown to correlate with IL-21-mediated apoptosis. Both CpG oligonucleotides working via TLR9 and CD40 ligand have been shown to up-regulate the IL21R-\u03b1 in CLL cells. We have systematically interrogated IL21R-\u03b1 promoter regulation to facilitate novel pharmacologic combination strategies with IL-21. Initial studies were initiated with CpG685, a novel CpG oligonucleotide currently in clinical trials for CLL at our institution. CpG685 promotes immune activation of CLL cells with enhanced NF-\u03baB DNA binding concurrent with up-regulation of CD40, CD80, CD86, and HLA-DR antigen expression. A similar activation phenotype on CLL cells has been noted with CD40 ligand treatment. Interestingly, CpG685 induced a time-dependent induction of IL21R-\u03b1 in CLL cells at as early as six hours. Quantitative real time PCR revealed that this up-regulation was due to enhanced transcriptional activity, showing an increase in IL21R-\u03b1 mRNA with peak levels occurring 3 hours post treatment with CpG 685. IL21R-\u03b1 transcript levels showed a mean 16-fold change over media control at 3 hours of CpG685 treatment, with variability between patients. Up-regulated IL21R-\u03b1 was functionally competent as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of downstream targets of IL-21 such as STAT1, STAT3, and JAK1, following treatment with IL-21, as compared to media controls. The functional competence of CpG685-induced IL21R-\u03b1 to mediate IL-21-induced apoptosis was evaluated. For a subset of patients that showed upregulation of IL21R-\u03b1 but no cytotoxicity in response to CpG685 or IL-21 alone, the combination of CpG685 and IL-21 enhanced IL-21 mediated cytotoxicity. We next explored how CpG685 influences the promoter of IL21R-\u03b1. Luciferase promoter constructs containing the proximal SP1 binding site, previously reported to be important in transcriptional activation of IL21R-\u03b1 in T-cells, did not show increased activity in CpG685 treated CLL cells as compared to control. We therefore hypothesized that alternative cis elements and trans-factors distal to this site may be involved in regulation. Given that both CpG685 and CD40 ligand enhance NF-\u03baB DNA binding and promote IL21R-\u03b1 expression on CLL cells, we next determined if early inhibition of NF-\u03baB DNA binding by the IKK-\u03b2 inhibitor Bay11 prevented IL21R-\u03b1 induction. Indeed, Bay11 treatment of CLL cells prevents CpG685 induction of IL21R-\u03b1; preliminary data from a single experiment confirmed concurrent diminished NF-\u03baB DNA binding. Ongoing studies are focused on identifying the specific NF-\u03baB DNA binding site responsible for enhanced IL21R-\u03b1 expression. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that therapeutic agents such as CpG685 that activate CLL cells through enhanced transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB have unique potential for combination strategies with other non-immunosuppressive agents such as IL-21.
