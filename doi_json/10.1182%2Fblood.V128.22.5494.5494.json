    "abstract_text": "CALR mutations are present in 70-84% of JAK2 wild-type myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and 67% and 88% of essential thrombocytopenia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) respectively. Most cases of MPN are apparently sporadic, but 7-11% have evidence of familial predisposition. While germline mutations in ET-associated genes, MPL and JAK2 , have been described in hereditary thrombocytosis, germline mutations in CALR have not been described in any setting. Two types of CALR mutations are common in MPN: a 52-base pair deletion (bp) and a 5 bp insertion, both in exon 9. With rare exceptions, CALR mutations are generally mutually exclusive with JAK2 or MPL mutations and have very rarely been reported in conjunction with the BCR-ABL1 translocation. Here, we report a patient with a germline CALR mutation, thrombocytosis, and subsequent development of BCR-ABL + CML. A 67-year-old female with no significant medical history presented with severe abdominal pain and nausea. Peripheral blood analysis revealed a marked leukocytosis composed of 66% neutrophils, 16% myelocytes, 6.5% monocytes, 3.5% basophils, 2.5% promyelocytes, 2.5% metamyelocytes, 1.5% lymphocytes, 1.5% blasts, and no eosinophils. The patient was non-anemic and had a normal platelet count (340,000/mm 3 ). Bone marrow biopsy revealed a hypercellular marrow with myeloid predominant trilineage hematopoiesis and 1-2% blasts with morphology consistent with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Fluorescence in-situ hybridization analysis of peripheral blood identified a BCR-ABL1 fusion in 98.5% of interphase cells. After 3 months of standard imatinib therapy, quantitative RT-PCR showed a reduction of BCR-ABL1/ABL1 in the peripheral blood, however platelet count was elevated at 539,000/mm 3 . Thrombocytosis persisted over 2 years with a maximal platelet count of 584,000/mm 3 . Given the patient's thrombocytosis, her peripheral blood was subjected to a next generation sequencing of JAK2 , MPL , and CALR genes. A 52-bp out-of-frame deletion in exon 9 of the CALR gene was detected (52% allele frequency) in peripheral blood. In addition, the same 52-bp CALR deletion (63% allele frequency) was present at the time of diagnosis and within a buccal specimen (47% allele frequency) when the BCR-ABL1 transcript was 1% in the peripheral blood. Immunostain of the buccal sample was strongly positive for cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3 but CD45 was not detected indicating no leukocyte contamination. This case reports the first instance of a germline CALR mutation associated with thrombocytosis and is the fourth report of the co-occurrence of BCR-ABL1 and CALR mutation in a single patient. Evolution to BCR-ABL1 + CML suppressed the CALR- mutant thrombocytosis phenotype, emphasizing the effect of these genes on lineage determination in abnormal myeloid proliferation.
