    "abstract_text": "Serotonin (5-HT) has been recently identified as a novel growth factor. We previously demonstrated that 5-HT enhances murine megakaryopoiesis via 5-HT 2 receptors and has promotor effect on hematopoiesis(Yang M et al, Stem Cells, 2007). However, the molecular mechanism remains under explored. In the terminal stage of mammalian megakaryocyte development, platelets are released from proplatelet protruding from megakaryocytes via cytoskeleton reorganization. 5-HT is shown to modulate cell migration and remolding by activating cytoskeleton reorganization, but the effects of 5-HT on proplatelet formation have not been investigated. Our results showed that 5-HT significantly promoted human CFU-MK formation and reduced apoptosis on human megakaryocytes through phosphorylation of Akt. These effects were attenuated by addition of ketanserin, a 5HT 2 receptor inhibitor. 5-HT also stimulated proplatelet formation through activating the p-Erk1/2 expression and F-actin reorganization. Melatonin, the metabolism of 5-HT, promoted the recovery of platelets and the formation of bone marrow colony forming units in irradiated mice. Our findings suggested that 5-HT and melatonin plays an important role in human megakaryopoiesis. Interaction of 5-HT and 5-HTR 2B induced downstream activation of PI3-k/Akt signal pathway leading to human MK cell proliferation. In addition, activation of 5-HTR 2B also induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation, which then promoted cytoskeleton reorganization and subsequent proplatelet formation. We also proved that melatonin exerts a protective effect on MK and platelets in the irradiation mice model. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
