    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2416 NK cells play an important role in tumor immunosurveillance. Their reactivity is governed by various immunoregulatory molecules, which influence both direct anti-tumor immunity and NK responses induced by therapeutic antibodies like Rituximab. Various members of the TNF/TNFR family modulate differentiation, proliferation, activation, and death of both tumor and immune effector cells including NK cells. Recently we reported that the TNFR family member 4-1BB/CD137 is expressed on human NK cells following activation. In contrast to the stimulatory role of its murine counterpart, we found that human 4-1BB impairs NK anti-tumor reactivity upon interaction with its ligand 4-1BBL expressed on blasts of a substantial proportion of acute myeloid leukemia patients ( Blood 115: 3058-69; 2010). In addition, we found that expression of 4-1BBL is general feature of leukemic cells of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients causing impaired direct and Rituximab-induced NK cell reactivity ( Blood 114: 279; 2009 ). Here we report that reverse signaling via 4-1BBL into CLL cells following interaction with 4-1BB, which is absent on NK cells of healthy donors, but expressed at substantial levels on NK cells of CLL patients, induced pronounced production of immunoregulatory cytokines like TNF, IL-6 and IL-8 by the CLL cells. Moreover, we found that sera of CLL patients contained elevated levels of these immunoregulatory cytokines as compared to healthy controls. When PBMC of healthy donors were exposed to supernatants of in vitro cultured CLL cells or sera from CLL patients, this resulted in pronounced 4-1BB expression on the NK cells. This effect could be prevented by addition of the TNF blocker Infliximab to patient sera. The 4-1BB expression induced by CLL sera resulted in impaired NK reactivity specifically against 4-1BBL-expressing targets as revealed by functional analyses with 4-1BBL transfectants and the respective mock-controls. Moreover, the induced 4-1BB expression also impaired NK cell reactivity against primary CLL cells constitutively expressing 4-1BBL, thus closing a cycle of immune evasion. Taken together, our data demonstrate that 4-1BBL enables CLL cells to evade NK anti-tumor reactivity, and disruption of the \u201cvicious 4-1BB-4-1BBL cycle\u201d in CLL - NK interaction e.g. by TNF- or 4-1BB-blockade may serve well to enhance NK reactivity in therapeutic strategies like antibody treatment or allogenic stem cell transplantation in CLL, which rely on sufficient NK cell function.
