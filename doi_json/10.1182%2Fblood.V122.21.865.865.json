    "abstract_text": "Background In CLL, the TP53 gene may be inactivated by deletion and/or mutations. Most cases with 17p deletion also carry TP53 mutations on the second allele. However, in a subset of cases only one allele seems to be disrupted by either mutation or deletion. It is still a matter of debate whether monoallelic TP53 abnormalities have the same poor prognostic effect as biallelic alterations. Further, a small subset of patients with TP53 deletions harboring mutated IGHV genes were described to exhibit a slowly progressive disease without treatment indication for years. Aims In this study, we addressed the following questions: 1. Frequency of TP53 alterations: mutation and deletion. 2. Characterization of the TP53 altered subsets with respect to IGHV mutation status, other molecular mutations and cytogenetics. 3. Impact on survival. Patients and Methods 3,988 CLL patients were analyzed by DNA sequencing for TP53 mutations and by FISH for TP53 deletion status as well as for del(13q), del(11q) and +12. IGHV mutation status was determined in 3,505 patients. Further, SF3B1 (n=1,245), MYD88 (n=1,026), XPO1 (n=1,025), NOTCH1 (n=973), and FBXW7 (n=962) were analyzed by DNA sequencing. Results 488/3,988 (12.2%) harbored a TP53 mutation ( TP53 mut) and 308/3,988 (7.7%) patients showed a TP53 deletion ( TP53 del) by FISH. 268 cases (6.7%) showed both a TP53 del and a TP53 mut, while 220 cases (5.5%) harbored a TP53 mut only and 40 (1.0%) a TP53 del only. 20.5% of TP53 mut cases harbored more than one TP53 mut. The frequency of TP53 mut and TP53 del increased significantly with age (\u226440 yrs: 2.4%/2.4%; 41-50 yrs: 7.5%/4.0%; 51-60 yrs: 12.4%/6.8%; 61-70 yrs: 12.1%/8.1%; 71-80 yrs: 13.4%/9.1%; >80 yrs: 16.0%/9.9%; p=0.006 and p=0.013, respectively). In the entire cohort, 1,428/3,505 (40.7%) cases showed an unmutated and 2,077/3,505 (59.3%) a mutated IGHV status. The lowest frequency of IGHV unmutated was observed in cases without TP53 alteration (1,148/3,094; 37.1%) and the highest in patients with both TP53 mut and TP53 del (156/201; 77.6%). The frequency was in between in patients with TP53 mut sole (106/176; 60.2%) and TP53 del sole (18/34; 52.9%). Patients with both TP53 mut and TP53 del as well as patients with TP53 del sole had a significantly shorter overall survival (OS) compared to patients with TP53 mut sole or patients without TP53 alteration (OS at 5 yrs: 40.2% vs. 36.4% vs. 68.8% vs 85.4%; p<0.001; TP53 mut sole vs TP53 wt: p=0.003). Next, we evaluated the impact of the TP53 mutation load on survival. Therefore, we divided patients into 10 subgroups according to their mutation load (increments of 10%). The OS of patients with a mutation load <20% (n=150) did not differ from patients with TP53 wt, while a mutation load \u226520% was significantly associated with shorter OS (HR: 4.9, p<0.001). An unmutated IGHV status was associated with shorter OS in the total cohort (HR: 2.3, p<0.001). In the subset of patients with TP53 wt an unmutated IGHV status was also an adverse prognostic factor (OS at 5 yrs: IGHV unmutated vs mutated: 80.3% vs 88.6%, p=0.007). This was true also in cases with TP53 del sole (median OS: 12 months vs not reached, p=0.001). In contrast, in patients with either TP53 mut sole or both TP53 mut and TP53 del the IGHV status had no impact on OS. In the entire cohort univariate Cox regression analysis revealed the following parameters to be significantly associated with OS: TP53 mut (HR: 4.0), TP53 mut \u226520% (HR: 4.9), TP53 del (HR: 7.1), IGHV unmutated (HR: 2.3), age >60 yrs (HR: 3.3), del(11q) (HR: 2.1), del(13q) sole (HR: 0.6), SF3B1 mut (HR: 2.5) (for all p<0.001), and NOTCH1 mut (HR: 1.6, p=0.025). Multivariate Cox regression analysis including parameters significantly associated with OS in univariate analyses revealed the following factors to be independently associated with shorter OS: TP53 del (HR: 4.2, p<0.001), TP53 mut \u226520% (HR: 2.4, p=0.008), age >60 yrs (HR: 2.6, p<0.001), SF3B1 mut (HR: 2.4, p<0.001), and del(11q) (HR: 2.2, p=0.002). Conclusions 1. TP53 alterations were observed in 13.2% of CLL patients, 6.7% showed both a deletion and a mutation, while 1% showed a deletion only and 5.5% a mutation only. 2. Both TP53 mutations and TP53 deletions are associated with an unmutated IGHV status. 3. TP53 deletions had the most adverse impact on survival, TP53 mutations had a significant impact on OS only if the mutation load was \u226520%. A small subset of patients with TP53 deletion sole and a mutated IGHV status seems to have a favorable outcome. Disclosures: Haferlach: MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory: Employment, Equity Ownership.
