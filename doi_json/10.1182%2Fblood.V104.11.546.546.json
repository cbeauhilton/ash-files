    "abstract_text": "In almost all cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), t(15;17)(q22;q12) fuses the promyelocytic leukemia ( PML ) gene with the retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RARA ) gene. In rare cases of APL, other genes are fused to RARA including PLZF , NPM , NuMA , and STAT5b . These chimeras are collectively referred to as X-RARA fusions. Common features of the X-RAR\u03b1 fusions include their ability to form dimers through the X domain proteins while retaining the ability to interact with rexinoid receptors (RXRs, the proteins with which RAR\u03b1 normally heterodimerizes). We previously created an artificial X-RAR\u03b1: p50-RAR\u03b1 (a fusion of the dimerization interface of p50 NF\u03baB with the portion of RAR\u03b1 found in naturally occurring X-RAR\u03b1 proteins). p50-RAR\u03b1 has effects similar to PML-RAR\u03b1 including (i) enhancing repression at retinoic acid response elements, due to impaired release of co-repressors at low levels of all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and (ii) inhibiting differentiation of myeloid cell lines. We generated transgenic mice expressing p50-RAR\u03b1 under the control of the MRP8 promoter. p50-RAR\u03b1 had a minimal effect on myelopoiesis and initiated myeloid leukemias at a rate of <5% in the first year of observation. Nevertheless, transduction of p50-RARA transgenic bone marrow with a retrovirus expressing an activated cytokine receptor (\u03b2 c V449E ) generated leukemias with features of APL including therapeutic responsiveness to ATRA. Complementing our work with the p50-RARA transgenic mice, retroviral co-transduction of normal bone marrow with \u03b2 c V449E plus either p50-RARA or PML-RARA generated APL-like myeloid leukemias. Although retrovirally generated \u03b2 c /p50-RAR\u03b1 and \u03b2 c /PML-RAR\u03b1 leukemias were nearly identical, the PML fusion appeared associated with a subtle decrease in differentiation relative to the p50 fusion. In contrast to these X-RAR\u03b1 fusions, preliminary experiments suggest that RCR\u03b1 (a homodimeric form of RAR\u03b1 in which the dimerization interface of RAR\u03b1 has been replaced by the dimerization domain of the homodimeric COUP-TF transcription factor) does not readily cooperate with \u03b2 c V449E to cause leukemia. This finding lends support to the hypothesis that the decreased binding site selectivity of X-RAR\u03b1 fusions contributes to APL pathogenesis. Furthermore, we have generated a novel X-RAR\u03b1 fusion, F3-RAR\u03b1, in which three copies of the F36M mutant of the Rapamycin-binding protein have been fused to RAR\u03b1. This protein mimics the in vitro effects of PML-RAR\u03b1 on transcription & differentiation, and de-dimerization of F3-RAR\u03b1 by rapamycin reverses these effects. Additional experiments in vivo with F3-RAR\u03b1 are expected to further confirm the importance of abnormal transcription factor dimerization in leukemia pathogenesis."
