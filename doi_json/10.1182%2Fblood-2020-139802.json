    "abstract_text": "CT053 comprises autologous T cells genetically modified with a second-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) incorporating a fully human B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-specific single-chain fragment variant (25C2) with high binding affinity. Twenty-four subjects have been treated in phase 1 studies with an 87.5% overall response rate (ORR), 79.2% complete response (CR), and a median duration of response of 21.8 months without inducing immunogenicity [ Blood (2019) 134 (Supplement_1): 4435]. Here we present the ongoing phase 1b/2 study (LUMMICAR-2) conducted in North America (NCT03915184) to evaluate safety and clinical efficacy. Eligible subjects with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) had received \u22653 prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI), an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), and an anti-CD38 antibody, and had measurable disease per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. All subjects received a lymphodepletion regimen of cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m 2 /day \u00d72 days) and fludarabine (25 mg/m 2 / day \u00d7 3 days). A single infusion of CT053 at the targeted 1.5-3.0\u00d710 8 CAR+ T-cell dose was administered after lymphodepletion. Primary objectives for phase 1b were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CT053 and to identify the recommended phase 2 dose. Adverse events (AEs) were graded using CTCAE, v5.0; cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity were graded according to ASTCT CRS consensus grading system (Lee DW et al, 2019). The response was assessed per 2016 IMWG criteria, and minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed by next generation flow cytometry or sequencing. As of July 28, 2020, 20 subjects have enrolled, and 14 subjects have received CT053 infusion in the phase 1b portion of the study, including 8 subjects who received 1.5-1.8\u00d710 8 CAR+ T cells while 6 subjects received 2.5-3.0\u00d710 8 CAR+ T cells. The treated subjects had a median age of 59 years (range 42-73), had received a median of 6 (range 3-11) prior lines of treatment, 93% were triple refractory to a PI, IMiD, and anti-CD38 antibody, and 64% were penta-refractory. In addition, 36% of the subjects had extramedullary disease at baseline, and 64% had high-risk cytogenetics. All subjects received bridging therapy. The most common \u2265 grade 3 AE was hematological toxicity. All subjects experienced \u2265 grade 3 neutropenia (100%) and leukopenia (100%), and 36% of subjects had \u2265 grade 3 thrombocytopenia within 30 days of treatment. No grade 3 or higher CRS or neurotoxicity was observed. Twelve of 14 subjects (86%) experienced grade 1 or 2 CRS, including 2 subjects who experienced grade 2 CRS and 1 subject who had grade 2 neurotoxicity. CRS events had a generally predictable time to onset, occurring at a median of 2 days post infusion with a median duration of 4 days (range 1-6). Two subjects received tocilizumab, and one subject with grade 2 CRS received both tocilizumab and steroids. One subject experienced grade 2 neurotoxicity with complete resolution within 24 hours upon administration of dexamethasone. At the data cutoff, 10 subjects were evaluable for at least two months of efficacy assessment with a median follow-up of 4.5 months (range 2-8). A 100% ORR was observed, with 2 stringent complete responses, 2 CRs, 1 very good partial response, and 5 partial responses. Of the 12 subjects with evaluable bone marrow samples, 11 were MRD-negative at the 10 -5 sensitivity level. Responses were independent of baseline bone marrow BCMA expression. CT053 transgene levels showed expansion and persistence in peripheral blood, with peak expansion at 7-14 days after infusion. All subjects showed similar kinetics of rapid declines in serum free light chains and soluble BCMA (sBCMA) levels within 1 month, and continued depletion in sBCMA suggests CT053-mediated pharmacodynamic activity. Serum C-reactive protein and cytokine levels (i.e., IL-6, IFN\u03b3, IL-8, IL-10) increased post-infusion within 7 days and correlated with the onset of CRS symptoms. Collectively, these results demonstrate that CT053 at a target dose of 1.5-3.0\u00d710 8 CAR+ T cells delivers early and deep responses, including MRD negativity, with an acceptable safety profile in subjects with heavily pretreated relapsed or refractory MM. The promising results from the ongoing LUMMICAR-2 study are consistent with the previous phase 1 studies and support the launch of a pivotal Phase 2 LUMMICAR-2 study. Updated results will be presented at the conference.
