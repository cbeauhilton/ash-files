    "abstract_text": "Purpose: Circulating cell-free DNA in blood may originate from cell necrosis, apoptosis, or NETosis. NETosis is a recently described inflammatory process in which neutrophils release a meshwork of DNA fibers called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to attack microorganisms. Higher levels of cell-free DNA have been observed in patients with sepsis and malignancy, and it may be linked to arterial thrombosis as well. We examined changes in cell-free DNA in infants who experienced acute, iatrogenic thrombosis of the femoral artery after arterial catheterization to better understand the role of cell-free DNA in clot formation. Methods: Plasma samples were collected from infants < 1 year of age with congenital heart disease during cardiac catheterization. Post-procedurally, femoral artery thrombus formation at the site of sheath insertion was detected by ultrasound. Cell-free DNA was quantified at two time points (before and after arterial catheterization) in three infants who developed femoral artery thrombus after catheterization and three age-matched controls. Cell-free DNA was also quantified from plasma of normal adults as a comparison. Results: At baseline,cell-free DNA level for the infant cohort was similar to that in normal adults (13.9 ng/mL vs. 10.3 ng/mL, p = 0.20, Figure). After arterial catheterization, cell-free DNA was increased from baseline in all infants (51.0 ng/mL vs. 13.9 ng/ml, p = 0.004). However, infants who developed femoral artery thrombus after catheterization did not demonstrate higher cell-free DNA after arterial injury, compared to the control group (47.1 ng/mL vs. 54.9 ng/ml, p = 0.83). Conclusions: Cell-free DNA is significantly and consistently elevated in infants after arterial catheterization. As part of NETosis, cell-free DNA may serve as an inflammatory mediator in infants who experience arterial injury. We plan to confirm the findings of this pilot study in a larger human infant cohort as well as in a piglet model of vascular injury.
