    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2342 Background: NOX-H94, the first-in-class hepcidin inhibitor in development for treatment of anemia of chronic disease (ACD), is a PEGylated anti-hepcidin L-RNA oligonucleotide. ACD is caused by iron sequestration in the reticulo-endothelial macrophages with subsequent iron restricted erythropoiesis due to high hepcidin production and subsequent ferroportin degradation. The treatment of ACD is challenging: a significant number of ACD patients do not respond to erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs), while repeated intravenous iron administrations bear a risk of iron overload. Targeting hepcidin may provide more efficacious and well tolerated treatment alternatives. Methods: This First-in-Human study investigated the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of escalating single and repeated doses of intravenous (i.v.) NOX-H94 in healthy men and women. The study protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01372137 ) was approved by an independent ethics committee and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Five successive cohorts of 8 healthy subjects, at least 3 men and women, were randomly assigned to i.v. doses of 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, and 4.8 mg/kg of NOX-H94 (n=6) or placebo (n=2). Similarly, 2 cohorts of 8 male subjects randomly received 5 doses of either 0.6 or 1.2 mg/kg NOX-H94 or placebo every other day (q2d). Safety parameters, iron parameters, total hepcidin-25 (sum of free circulating hepcidin-25 and hepcidin-25 bound to NOX-H94), and PK were assessed during treatment and follow-up periods of \u22653 weeks. Data are given as means\u00b1SD. Results: One man, assigned to 5 i.v. doses of 0.6 mg/kg, withdrew consent after 4 administrations; all other 55 subjects completed the study as scheduled. Safety: Treatment with NOX-H94 was generally safe and well tolerated. No serious adverse event occurred; headache and fatigue were the only treatment related events that occurred more than once. Mild and transient increases in transaminases (<2\u00d7ULN) were noted in subjects treated with NOX-H94 at single doses \u22652.4 mg/kg or with repeated doses of 1.2 mg/kg (4.2 mg/kg weekly). PK: After escalating single i.v. administrations of 0.3 to 4.8 mg/kg of NOX-H94, peak plasma concentrations of NOX-H94 (C max ) and systemic exposure (AUC) increased dose-proportionally. The elimination was bi-phasic with a terminal plasma half-life (t \u00bd ) in the range of 17 to 26 h. The systemic clearance (CL) was low ( Table 1 ). After repeated q2d i.v. administrations, no appreciable plasma accumulation was found based on C max and AUC. No obvious gender-difference was observed. PD: The plasma concentration of total hepcidin-25 increased dose-dependently upon NOX-H94 treatment, without ever exceeding the plasma concentration of NOX-H94. The PD effects were assessed by analysis of the area under the data time curve above baseline (AUD) of various iron parameters. Single and repeated doses of NOX-H94 up to 0.6 mg/kg had no effect on serum iron, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT) in the healthy subjects studied. At doses \u22651.2 mg/kg NOX-H94, serum iron, serum ferritin, and TSAT increased dose dependently. Table 1: Single dose PK of NOX-H94  Dose Group [mg/kg] . n . C max [\u03bcM] .

PK analyses showed a dose-linear systemic exposure. In these healthy subjects, only mild dose-dependent increases in iron parameters were observed which likely underestimate the effects that may be obtained in patients with iron-restricted anemia.
