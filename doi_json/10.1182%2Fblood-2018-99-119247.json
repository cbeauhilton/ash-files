    "abstract_text": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies continue to show excellent outcomes in hematological cancers. Achieving success in additional tumor indications, however, will likely require modulating inhibitory pathways that limit CAR T cell potency. We developed a megaTAL nuclease targeting the gene encoding Casitas B-lineage lymphoma proto-oncogene-b ( CBLB ), a ubiquitin ligase that serves as an intracellular checkpoint that negatively regulates T cell activation. The megaTAL nuclease platform has been previously shown to drive highly efficient genome editing in primary T cells. Electroporation of primary T cells with mRNA encoding the CBLB megaTAL resulted in >90% indels at the target locus and a concomitant reduction of Cbl-b protein levels. Specificity characterization studies revealed three detectable non-exonic off-target sites with near negligible indel frequencies. We next assessed the functional impact of CBLB disruption in CAR T cells engineered to target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). When co-cultured with EGFR+ target cells, CAR T cells with megaTAL-mediated CBLB gene knockout had a 2-fold increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production compared with mock-treated CAR T cells. We developed an A549 tumor xenograft model to test the activity of CBLB megaTAL-treated CAR T cells in vivo. While mock-treated CAR T cells had a transient impact on tumor growth, we observed complete and durable tumor elimination in mice infused with the CBLB megaTAL-treated CAR T cells. Improved responses in the megaTAL treated animals were particularly pronounced at lower CAR T cell doses, suggesting that CBLB knockout enhances the potency of CAR T cells. In summary, the CBLB megaTAL is a highly efficient and specific gene editing nuclease that enhances CAR T cell anti-tumor responses in vitro and in vivo, and thus could potentially improve the efficacy of CAR T therapy.
