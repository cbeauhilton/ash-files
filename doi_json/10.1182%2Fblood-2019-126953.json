    "abstract_text": "Objective: Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is a serious complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, limited data is available on its clinical features after cord blood transplantation (CBT) for patients with hematological malignancies. Method: We retrospectively reviewed 63 patients who underwent myeloablative CBT at our institution between July 2013 and June 2019 with a median follow-up of 14 months. Micafungin, Voriconzole or Posaconazole was used for IFD prophylaxis. Results: Eight patients were identified as having an IFD, including 2 with proven IFD, 1 with probable IFD, and 5 with possible IFD. The most common prophylaxis regimen is micafungin (68.2%, 43/63). The incidence rate of IFD in the primary antifungal prophylaxis (PAP) and secondary antifungal prophylaxis (SAP) groups were 11.3% and 25% (P=0.488). The OS of day at +100, six months and +200 in the IFD and No IFD groups were 62.5% vs. 86.9% (P=0.1), 50 % vs.78.2% (P=0.07), and 50% vs.75.9% (P=0.094), respectively. The 3-year probabilities of overall survival (OS) in the IFD and No IFD groups were 50% and 60.5%, respectively (p=0.316). The incidence rate of Non-relapse Mortality in the IFD and No IFD groups were 42.9% and 30%, respectively (p=0.319). Conclusion: Antifungal prophylaxis could help to reduce the incidence of IFD after CBT for patients with hematological malignancies.
