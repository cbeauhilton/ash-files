Nuclear factor erythroid-2\u2013related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a redox-sensitive transcription factor that regulates cellular responses to ROS and detoxification pathways implicated in chemoresistance, however, its role in normal stem cells is unknown. We analyzed Nrf2 null mice and found increased total bone marrow cellularity, cKit + Sca1 + Lin \u2212 (KSL) stem-progenitor cells, and long-term quiescent HSC (CD34 \u2212 KSL) compared to wild type mice (p<0.05). Transplantation of equal numbers of KSL cells from Nrf2 wt and Nrf2 null resulted in a five-fold decrease in peripheral blood chimerism from Nrf2 null derived cells at 16 weeks (15% wild type vs. 3% null, p<0.05). Unlike other models of deficiencies in genes associated with ROS handling, such as ATM or the FoxO family of transcription factors, basal ROS levels were not elevated in Nrf2 null HSC. However, Nrf2 null bone marrow cells demonstrated increased sensitivity to induced oxidative stress and in vitro treatment with H 2 O 2 resulted in a 2 fold decrease in colony formation in methylcellulose. We also examined the in vivo sensitivity of Nrf2 null cells to oxidative stress by irradiating (400 rads) stably chimeric mice 20 weeks following transplantation with either Nrf2 wt or Nrf2 null HSC. Mice receiving Nrf2 null HSC demonstrated a 50% decrease in peripheral blood chimerism at 4 months following radiation compared to no change in Nrf2 wt recipients (p<0.05) confirming that loss of Nrf2 leads to increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. Microarray gene expression analysis from Nrf2 wt and Nrf2 null mice revealed down regulation of the G-CSF cytokine receptor in Nrf2 null HSC and suggested that defective cytokine signaling may contribute to the HSC dysfunction seen in Nrf2 null bone marrow cells. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to rescue the function of Nrf2 null HSC by treating mice with exogenous G-CSF. Nrf2 wt and Nrf2 null mice were treated with one week of daily G-CSF and then HSC were harvested and transplanted. In contrast to the defects in engraftment of untreated Nrf2 null HSC, there was no significant difference in peripheral blood chimerism following transplantation of G-CSF treated Nrf2 wt or Nrf2 null HSC, thus demonstrating that G-CSF treatment could rescue the HSC defect in mutant mice. In conclusion, the Nrf2 transcription factor appears to be a novel and essential regulator of normal HSC function through the modulation of oxidative stress response and cytokine signaling.
