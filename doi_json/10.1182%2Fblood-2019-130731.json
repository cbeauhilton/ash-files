    "abstract_text": "Background : Current guidelines recommend the use of antifungal prophylaxis during, at least, the first three months post allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). However, these drugs are not exempt of adverse effects due to their own toxicity or drug-drug interactions. In addition, breakthrough mold infections seem to be emerging as a new problem in this setting. Objectives : The aim of this study was to analyze the benefit of a strategy in which allo-SCT patients were not routinely prescribed antifungal drugs except for the case of the development of neutropenic fever and/or exposure to high dose of corticosteroids. Main objectives were 1) requirement and time of exposure to antifungal treatment and 2) cumulative incidence (CI) of proven or probable IFI at 1, 3 and 6 months after transplant. Other objectives were IFI description and overall survival (OS). Patients and methods : 319 patients who underwent a first allo-SCT at our center between 2010 and 2017 and were not under antifungal prophylaxis at the moment of transplant were included. 181 patients (57%) were males and median age was 51 years, range (4-74). Acute myeloid leukemia (35%) was the most frequent diagnosis and myeloablative conditioning regimen was mostly used (69%). 99 patients (31%) received the stem cells from a mismatched donor and BM was the preferred stem cell source (72%). Fourteen patients (4%) did not engraft. The median length of neutropenia <0.5x10 9 /L and <0.1x10 9 /L were 12 days and 6 days, respectively. Forty-two patients (14%) developed acute GVHD grade III-IV. Post-mortem study was performed in 28 of the deceased patients (43%). Results: Thirty-one 31 patients (9.7%) did not receive antifungal drugs along the course of the transplantation, 58 patients (18%) required it for less than 1 week and only 24% were on therapy more than 3 weeks. The median total days on antifungal drugs was 13 days (0-175) for the entire population and 11 days (0-109) in patients who did not develop fungal infection and/or acute GVHD II-IV. Fluconazole (61%) was the main antifungal drug used during the neutropenic phase, followed by caspofungin (27%). Time on fluconazole was significantly shorter than caspofungin, 8 vs. 11 days, p=0.001. A change on antifungal therapy was needed in 130 (45%) patients and was more frequent in those who were receiving fluconazole (57%) compared to those who were receiving caspofungin (20%), p<0.0001. The CI of proven or probable IFI at day 30, 90 and 180 after transplant was 2.5%, 5.1% and 5.5%, respectively. Very importantly, none of the 106 patients who did not receive antifungal drugs or received less than one-week developed IFI. Twelve mold infection, 4 in the postmortem study, and 5 yeast infection were diagnosed. Microbiological identification was obtained in 9 patients; C. parapsilosis (3) , Rhizopus (2) , C. orthopsilosis (1), Criptococo laurentii (1), A. fumigatus (1), Alternaria spp. (1) . The restricted administration of antifungal drugs did not affect the overall survival, Figure 1. Conclusion : In our experience, a restrictive strategy for the use of antifungal drugs in the setting of allo-SCT is feasible and effective. It results in similar cumulative incidences of fungal infection than the recommended policy. Moreover, it allows almost 10% of patients to remain free of antifungal treatment throughout the procedure and one fourth of them being exposed for less than a week. This data supports the change in the antifungal prophylactic paradigm for allo-SCT patients.
