    "abstract_text": "Introduction. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) show immunosuppressive capacity in an allogeneic host. Severe progressive systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease in which prognosis is worsened in individuals presenting with diffuse cutaneous, lung and renal involvement. Immunosuppression can improve the course of the disease. Methods. We transplanted a 41 year old female patient suffering from diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis with MSC from her father after in vitro expansion of the MSC. Results. The patient presented with a remarkable clinical response. Her ulcer surface decreased, the 17 Site Modified Rodnan Skin Score, vascular ultrasound, mouth aperture, the Visual Analogue Scale for pain (VAS), the Valentini Activity Score and the Hannover Functional Questionnaire showed encouraging improvements. The patient did not experience any adverse events during the first 300 days after transplantation. Conclusions. The transplantation of MSC from a haploidentical donor into a patient with systemic sclerosis is feasible, safe and effective. Furthermore is the transplantation of MSC from a haploidentical donor into an adult without severe pharmacological immunosuppression at the time of transplantation feasible and safe.",
