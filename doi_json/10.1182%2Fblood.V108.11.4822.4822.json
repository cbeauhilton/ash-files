    "abstract_text": "Background: Imatinib mesylate (Glivec,Novartis), an inhibitor of Bcr-abl tyrosine kinase, is currently being used in the treatment of CML with hematological, cytogenetic and molecular response. In Brazil, this drug is approved by Health Department for chronic phase (CP) as a second line drug and as first line for accelerated (AP) and blastic phase (BP). Rio Grande do Sul (RS) Cooperative Group for Treatment of CML coordinates the treatment of this disease in Rio Grande do Sul, the southern most state of Brazil that differs from the north part of the country regarding climate, population profile (mostly European descendents) and a high number of farm workers. Methods: 211 CML Ph+ patients are presently being treated in RS. Sex distribution: 96 male and 115 females, aged 11\u201380 years (median 48 y);166/211 in CP, 42/211 in AP and 11/211 in BP. Imatinib daily dose is 400 mg (CP) and 600 mg (AP and BP). 166/211 patients are in treatment with imatinib and 32/211, interferon or hydroxyureia. In imatinib group, 144/166 patients are in complete hematologic response and 57/166 in complete cytogenetic remission. Conclusions: in Brazil, imatinib treatment is limited by economic problems and the drug is used latter in course of disease. This may compromise the results, as seen in the low cytogenetic complete response described above. We are now investigating this results in order tofind other related factors."
