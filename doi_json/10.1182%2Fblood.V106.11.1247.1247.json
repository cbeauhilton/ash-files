In most cases the cause is unknown, but chronic infections such as hepatitis C, studied here, are often associated with ITP (ITP-C). In ITP-C, it is not clear whether platelets are destroyed by viral immune complex or by Gp Ab, as in classic active ITP (ITP-A). Antiviral therapy may not induce remission in ITP-C, so its management remains problematic. We investigated Gp Ab in ITP-C vs . ITP-A, and evaluated efficacy of IL-11 in a group of patients (pts) with ITP-C. A previous study found that IL-11 is ineffective in treatment of ITP-A [ Am J Hematol , 2001 ; 66 : 172 \u20137 ]. METHODS. We studied 35 pts with ITP-A (19F, 16M, mean age 53yr, mean platelet count 61,000/\u03bcL) and 15 with ITP-C (9F, 6M, mean age 61yr, mean platelet count 66,0000/\u03bcL). Lab tests included CBC, platelet counts, liver function tests, HCV-RNA, and clotting factor activity (FVIII & vWF). Ab against Gp were assayed by PAICA. Six pts with ITP-C were treated with IL-11 (50 mg/kg) for 7 days to 9 mo\u2019s. In four, clinical courses were followed after discontinuing IL-11. RESULTS. As shown in Table 1, the prevalence of all 3 Gp Ab (IIb/IIIa, Ib/IX, and IV) was significantly more frequent in ITP-C than ITP-A, for both IgG (p\u2264 0.007) and IgM (p=0.005). Mean titers of Ab were also higher in ITP-C than ITP-A, but only IgM Ab were significant (p<0.001). vWF and FVIII were above normal in both groups, but the only significant difference between the groups was in vWF, higher in ITP-C than ITP-A in terms of frequency of elevation (71% vs. 34%, p=0.002) and titer (2.63 U/mL vs. 1.69 U/mL, p=0.005). Results of IL-11 treatment. In the six ITP-C pts treated with IL-11, platelet counts rose in all cases in 1\u20132 wk (mean pre = 61,000; mean post = 112,000/uL), and liver enzymes normalized in 1\u20132 wk. We also found an antiviral effect of IL-11: mean HCV-RNA fell from 3.167 x10 6 to 0.741 x10 6 after 1\u20133 wk. In only 1 pt did the HCV-RNA go up during the treatment, and began to decline when IL-11 was discontinued. In all 4 pts followed after discontinuing IL-11, platelet count dropped after 1\u20133 wk (from 112,000 to 90,000/\u03bcL). In 2 pts, liver enzymes rose after 1\u20133 wk but remained normal in the other two. HCV-RNA assay was repeated after 3\u20138 mo\u2019s in 3 pts; mean value was 1.925 x10 6 . In 2 pts, Gp Ab disappeared following treatment. CONCLUSIONS. (a) In excess of 90% of pts with ITP-C had specific Gp Ab. This indicates that ITP in hepatitis C is autoimmune-mediated similar to classic ITP, not immune-complex mediated. (b) The high incidences of elevated FVIII and vWF could be secondary to inflammation, and may play a role in limiting bleeding. (c) Our preliminary data on use of IL-11 in ITP-C is encouraging, as most responded favorably. Treatment was associated with decreased levels of HCV-RNA and Gp Ab. Tab 1  . ITP-A, n=35 .
