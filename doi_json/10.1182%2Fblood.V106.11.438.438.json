    "abstract_text": "Growing evidence indicates that the therapeutic potential of imatinib mesylate (IM) for the treatment of CML may be limited initially by a relative innate resistance of the leukemic stem cells and eventually by an accumulation of cells with BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase domain mutations. We now show that the amount and tyrosine kinase activity of p210-BCR-ABL in the most primitive and relatively IM-unresponsive lin \u2212 CD34 + CD38 \u2212 CML cells is 3 to 10-fold higher than in the majority of the lin \u2212 CD34 + CD38 + CML progenitors (n=3). These results confirm previous BCR-ABL transcript data and identify elevated p210-BCR-ABL expression to be a likely important factor in the characteristic IM-insensitivity of very primitive CML cells. To determine whether in vivo, CML stem cells also accumulate gene mutations affecting the BCR-ABL kinase domain, cDNAs were prepared from RNA extracts of purified lin \u2212 CD34 + CD38 \u2212 cells isolated from 3 chronic phase patients that had not received IM therapy. Bidirectional sequencing of individually cloned cDNAs from these samples revealed BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations in 2 of the 3 patients at frequencies of 10% (1/10), 20% (2*/10,*identical mutations). Incubation of these lin \u2212 CD34 + CD38 \u2212 cells in vitro for 2\u20133 wk \u00b1 a high concentration of IM (up to 10 \u03bcM, which was sufficient to reduce the tyrosine kinase activity in the input cells by 70\u00b112% and in their 2 wk progeny by 10\u00b15%) selected a subpopulation of more differentiated and completely IM-resistant cells. This was shown in Western blots by the inability of 10 \u03bcM IM to reduce either their p210-BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity or CrkL phosphorylation and in methylcellulose assays \u00b15 \u03bcM IM. As predicted, IM-selected cells showed a higher frequency of kinase domain mutations (13\u201320% vs 0\u201320% of cDNA clones analyzed from 3 wk cells cultured \u00b1IM). Analysis of individual colonies produced from CFCs in the cultured cells showed all (21/21) colonies from IM-selected cells had mutations vs 50% (5/10) in those cultured without IM. The total frequency of mutant cDNAs detected was also increased in the IM-resistant cells (35\u201355% vs 10\u201325% mutant cDNAs in selected vs control cells). Interestingly, in most cases, both wild-type and mutant cDNAs were identified in the same colony, indicating de novo generation of mutations in vitro. Overall, >50 different mutations were identified. These included 10 point mutations previously associated with clinical IM resistance (including G250 and T315), another 13 point mutations previously identified in a comprehensive mutational screen, and >20 previously undescribed mutations. Several of the latter affect the critical region of the P loop, the c-helix and the activation loop and would be predicted to confer significant IM resistance. To investigate the possibility that the observed genomic instability of very primitive CML cells might be related to their elevated innate p210-BCR-ABL activity, BCR-ABL transcript levels in individual IM-selected, fully resistant and control (similarly treated but no IM exposure) colonies were compared. This showed that BCR-ABL transcripts were ~20-fold higher (P<0.05) in the resistant colonies (30 assessed from 3 patients). These findings suggest that the increased BCR-ABL expression and activity that uniquely characterizes the most primitive CML cells may contribute not only to their innate insensitivity to IM but also to a deregulation of genomic stability leading to the emergence of IM-resistant mutants and other subclones associated with disease progression.",
