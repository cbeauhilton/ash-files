    "abstract_text": "ZBP1 is an inducible nucleic acid (NA) sensor that is activated when pathogen NA bind to its Z\u03b1 and Z\u03b2 domains. ZBP1 is required for TBK1-dependent phosphorylation of the transcription factor IRF3 (pIRF3) followed by its direct activation of type I interferon genes. However, the role, if any, of ZBP1 in tumour biology is not known. By searching for genes selectively expressed in multiple myeloma (MM) we identified ZBP1 mRNA expressed in 29 MM cell lines (MMCL) but not in >1000 other cancer cell lines (CCLE dataset); ZBP1 was expressed in all 766 patient myeloma PC (CoMMpass dataset) but not in normal blood cells (Blueprint) or 53 healthy tissues (GTex). We confirmed expression of ZBP1 mRNA and/or protein in MMCL, primary human and murine germinal centre B (GCB) and plasma cells (PC) as well as in myeloma PC. By inducing T cell-dependent humoral immune responses after ip alum-NP-KLH immunisation, we explored the role of selective and constitutive expression of Zbp1 in GCB to PC transition. We found no differences in the frequency of splenic GCB cells and PC between control WT and Zbp1-/- mice and in GCB cell frequency between immunised WT and Zbp1-/- mice. However, compared to WT, the increase in PC frequency in immunised Zbp1-/- mice was 50% lower (n=10/group, p<0.0001) commensurate with a 40% (n=6/group, p<0.01), lower increase in NP-KLH-specific IgG but not IgM levels in Zbp1-/- mice. These findings suggest that although Zbp1 is not required for GCB cell and PC development it is required for optimal, T cell-dependent humoral immune responses. To explore the function of ZBP1 in MM we depleted by 2 lentiviral shRNAs either isoform 1 (contains both Z\u03b1 and Z\u03b2 domains; shRNA1) or both isoform 1 and isoform 2 (latter lacks Z\u03b1 domain; shRNA2). Both shRNAs were toxic to all 5 MMCL tested suggesting that isoform 1 but not isoform 2 is essential for myeloma cell survival. This effect was specific because survival of K562 cells, which lack expression of ZBP1, was not affected by either shRNA and exogenous ZBP1 cDNA rescued cell death of ZBP1-depleted myeloma cells. Dox-induced ZBP1 depletion was toxic to MMCL in vitro and significantly inhibited myeloma cell growth in a subcutaneous NSG model of the MMCL H929 and MM.1S. Together, these findings reveal a novel myeloma cell-specific ZBP1 dependency. Transcriptome analysis of ZBP1-depleted H929 and MM.1S cells showed amongst the significantly downregulated genes enrichment for the cell cycle control and DNA repair pathways consistent with a critical role of ZBP1 in promoting myeloma cell proliferation. Flow-cytometric analysis of ZBP1-depleted MMCL as well as of patient-derived myeloma PC revealed cell cycle arrest at the G0/1 phase and increasing apoptosis. Exploring potential links with IRF3, we first observed that unlike in non-malignant cells, IRF3 was constitutively phosphorylated in MMCL. Using protein-co-immunoprecipitation we found that endogenous ZBP1 interacts with IRF3 and TBK1 while upon co-transfection with different ZBP1 deletion mutants, ZBP1-IRF3 interaction required primarily the ZBP1, RHIM domain-containing, C-terminus. Further, while in ZBP1-depleted myeloma cells total IRF3 and TBK1 levels were not altered, pIRF3 and pTBK1 levels decreased thus showing a post-translational dependency of constitutive pIRF3 and pTBK1 on ZBP1. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of TBK1 resulted in decrease of pIRF3 without affecting total IRF3. Importantly, shRNA-mediated IRF3 depletion resulted in cell cycle arrest and death of MMCL. By integrating histone mark and in-house IRF3 ChiP-seq with transcriptome of IRF3-depleted MM.1S cells we identified 770 down- and 330 up-regulated genes predicted to be directly regulated by IRF3. Pathway enrichment analysis confirmed cell cycle as the most highly regulated by IRF3. Notably, we observed no direct or indirect regulation of the interferon genes (e.g., IFNA1 , IFNB1 ) by IRF3. As well as the IRF3 motif, IRF3 cistrome analysis revealed significant enrichment for the distinct IRF4 motif. Integration of the IRF3/IRF4 cistromes identified >80% IRF3 binding regions are co-occupied by IRF4 and co-regulation of cell cycle genes. Further we validated IRF3-IRF4 interaction at the IRF4 super-enhancer by ChIP-re-ChIP. These data show a novel dependency in MM comprising constitutive activation of the ZBP1-IRF3 pathway and regulation of cell cycle and proliferation by IRF3 thus providing opportunities for therapeutic targeting.
