    "abstract_text": "Background : DEC10-VEN is an effective regimen and offers better outcomes compared to intensive chemotherapy in older pts with newly diagnosed (ND) or relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML (Maiti. Am J Hematol 2021; Maiti. Cancer 2021). We report long term outcomes in major genomic subgroups. Methods : Pts received decitabine 20 mg/m 2 on D1-10 until CR/CRi, followed by 5-day cycles. VEN dose was 400 mg daily but held on C1D21 if D21 bone marrow (BM) had \u22645% blasts. VEN could be reduced to <14 days in cases of myelosuppression (DiNardo. Lancet Haematol 2020). Treatment-na\u00efve group included pts with ND and secondary AML (sAML) without therapy for antecedent hematological disorder (AHD). Previously treated AML included sAML with prior therapy for AHD and R/R AML. Concomitant TKIs included gilteritinib (18), sorafenib (13), midostaurin (5), enasidenib (3) and ponatinib (1). Eligible pts could proceed to stem cell transplantation (SCT) after response. Endpoints were defined per ELN2017. NGS targeting entire coding regions of 81 myeloid genes was performed on screening BM sample with an analytical sensitivity of 5%. Measurable residual disease (MRD) was tested by multiparametric flow cytometry (sensitivity 0.1%). Results : Between January 2018 and April 2021 we enrolled 199 pts with ND AML (n=83), untreated sAML (n=20), treated sAML (n=25), and R/R AML (n=71). Median age of treatment-na\u00efve pts was 72 yrs (range 61-72) and of previously treated pts was 67 yrs (range 18-85, Table 1 ). No pts had favorable risk cytogenetics. Median no. of prior therapies in previously treated pts was 2 (range 1-8) and 24% pts (23/96) had prior SCT. 21 treatment-na\u00efve and 20 previously treated pts underwent SCT after response. Median follow-up for all pts was 25.4 mo. Among treatment-na\u00efve pts, CR/CRi rates were high in all mutations subgroups ranging from 70-88% in pts with NPM1 mut , FLT3 mut , IDH1/2 mut , TP53 mut , RUNX1 mut , K/NRAS mut . Pts with ASXL1 mut had modest CR/CRi rate of 56% ( Table 2 ). FLT3 TKI was used in 71% FLT3 mut pts (n=15/21). MRD negative rate among responding pts were high across all mutational subgroups ranging from 62-91%, except 55% in pts with ASXL1 mut and 50% in pts with TP53 mut . Median overall survival (OS) for treatment-na\u00efve pts with NPM1 mut was not reached (NR), IDH1/2 mut was 29.6 mo, FLT3 mut was 24.5 mo, RUNX1 mut was 16.2 mo, ASXL1 mut was 15.2 mo, K/NRAS mut was 12.1 mo and TP53 mut was 5.4 mo ( Fig 1a-b ). The median relapse-free survival (RFS) among treatment-na\u00efve pts with NPM1 mut was NR, IDH1/2 mut was NR, FLT3 mut was 20.0 mo, RUNX1 mut was 9.7 mo, ASXL1 mut was 8.5 mo, K/NRAS mut was 6.5 mo and TP53 mut was 3.1 mo ( Fig 1c-d ). Among NPM1 + FLT3 co-mutated pts, outcomes in treatment-na\u00efve pts (n=26) included ORR of 96%, CR/CRi in 88%, MRD negative in 92% (22/24), median OS NR and median RFS NR. Among previously treated NPM1 + FLT3 pts (n=9), ORR was 78%, CR/CRi in 56%, MRD negative in 86% (6/7), median OS 12.4 mo and median RFS 6.6 mo. Among NPM1 + DNMT3A co-mutated pts, outcomes in treatment-na\u00efve pts (n=28) included ORR of 93%, CR/CRi in 89%, MRD negative in 79% (19/24), median OS 15.2 mo and median RFS 9.0 mo. Among previously treated NPM1 + DNMT3A pts (n=6), ORR was 75%, CR/CRi in 50%, MRD negative in 75% (3/4), median OS was 4.7 mo and median RFS was 5.2 mo. Among previously treated pts CR/CRi rates in pts with NPM1 mut was 68%, IDH1/2 mut 50%, FLT3 mut 42%, RUNX1 mut 45%, ASXL1 mut 38%, TP53 mut 30%, and K/NRAS mut was 26% ( Table 2 ). FLT3 TKI used in 95% of FLT3 mut pts (n=18/19). MRD negative rate among responding pts were high for pts with NPM1 mut , FLT3 mut , IDH1/2 mut , RUNX1 mut and ASXL1 mut ranging from 60-87%, but were low for pts with K/NRAS mut at 56% and TP53 mut at 37%. The median OS among previously treated pts with IDH1/2 mut was 16.9 mo, RUNX1 mut was 13.7 mo, NPM1 mut was 12.4 mo, ASXL1 mut was 9.0 mo, FLT3 mut was 6.4 mo, K/NRAS mut was 6.0 mo, and for TP53 mut was 4.5 mo ( Fig 1e-f ). The median RFS among treatment-na\u00efve pts with K/NRAS mut was 18.9 mo, NPM1 mut was 15.6 mo, IDH1/2 mut was 15.3, RUNX1 mut was 12.9 mo, ASXL1 mut was 10.7 mo, TP53 mut was 9.4 mo, and for FLT3 mut was 6.6 mo ( Fig 1g-h ). Conclusions: DEC10-VEN offered high rates of CR/CRi, negative MRD, favorable OS and RFS across several genomic subgroups of treatment-na\u00efve AML including NPM1 , FLT3 , IDH1/2 and modest outcomes in pts with these mutations in salvage setting. Outcomes in pts with TP53 , RUNX1 , ASXL1 and K/NRAS were suboptimal. Outcomes with FLT3 VEN HMA triplet was encouraging, particularly for frontline FLT3 mut pts.
