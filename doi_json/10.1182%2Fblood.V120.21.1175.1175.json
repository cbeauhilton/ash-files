    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1175 Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune-mediated disorder that can cause fatal arterial or venous thrombosis/thromboembolism. Immune complexes consisting of platelet factor 4 (PF4), heparin and PF4/heparin-reactive antibodies are central to the pathogenesis of HIT. However, the B-cell origin of HIT antibody production is not known. Here we show that upon challenge with PF4/heparin complexes, anti-PF4/heparin antibody production is severely impaired in B cell-specific Notch2-deficient mice (CD19CreNotch2 fl/fl ) that specifically lack marginal zone (MZ) B cells, and that antibody production is readily generated in wild-type mice (CD19CreNotch2 +/+ ). As expected, Notch2-deficient mice responded normally to challenge with T cell-dependent antigen NP-CGG but not T cell-independent antigen TNP-Ficoll, in agreement with the lack of MZ B cells in the mutant mice. PF4/heparin-specific antibodies produced by wild-type mice on a C57BL/6 background were IgG2b and IgG3 isotypes. An in vitro class-switching assay showed that MZ B cells from wild-type C57BL/6 mice were capable of producing antibodies of IgG2b and IgG3 isotypes. Lastly, MZ, but not follicular (FO), B cells adoptively transferred into B cell-deficient muMT mice responded to PF4/heparin complex challenge by producing PF4/heparin-specific antibodies of IgG2b and IgG3 isotypes. Taken together, these data demonstrate that MZ B cells play a critical role in production of PF4/heparin-specific antibodies. Disclosures: Arepally: Teva Pharmaceuticals: Research Funding."
