    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3404 Background: Appropriate periprocedural management of the chronically-anticoagulated patient with an inherited or acquired thrombophilia is uncertain. Objective: To estimate the 3-month cumulative incidence of thromboembolism (TE) and major bleeding and test thrombophilia as a potential predictor of these outcomes among chronically-anticoagulated patients undergoing a procedure. Methods: 2182 consecutive patients referred to the Mayo Thrombophilia Center for standardized peri-procedural anticoagulation management were followed for TE, major bleeding and survival. The three-month cumulative incidence rates for TE, major bleeding and death were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analyses. For each chronic anticoagulation indication, we tested \u201cstrong\u201d thrombophilia (antithrombin, protein C or protein S deficiency, homozygous or combined heterozygous Factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A), \u201dweak\u201d thrombophilia (heterozygous Factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A), lupus anticoagulant/antiphospholipid antibodies and bridging heparin as potential predictors of TE and major bleeding using Cox proportional hazards modeling. Results: Patients with thrombophilia tended to be younger with a slight female predominance. Compared to no thrombophilia, thrombophilia patients (n=202; 143 bridged with heparin) had similar rates of venous (0% vs. 0.5%; p=0.34) and arterial (0.5% vs. 0.5%; p=0.94) thromboembolism, major bleeding (2.0% vs. 2.0%; p=0.97) and mortality (1.5% vs. 2.2%; p=0.52). Among thrombophilia patients, the TE and major bleeding rates were similar for strong (n=29) or weak thrombophilia (n=99), or lupus anticoagulant/antiphospholipid antibodies (n=74). Similarly, among thrombophilia patients, bridging heparin did not affect the rates of major bleeding (2.1% vs. 1.7%; p=0.85) or TE (0.7% vs. 0%, p=0.52). Conclusions: Inherited or acquired thrombophilia does not appear to impact the rates of TE, major bleeding or mortality after temporary interruption of chronic anticoagulation for an invasive procedure.
