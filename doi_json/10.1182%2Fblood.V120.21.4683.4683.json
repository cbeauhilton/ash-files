    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4683 Natural killer (NK) cells can kill malignant or virus-infected cells through the interaction of activating and inhibitory receptors without needing specific antigen recognition of target cells, and therefor have broad therapeutic applications for treatment of human malignancies. However, due to their limited life-span in vivo and poor expansion in vitro, production of sufficient numbers of NK cells for effective adoptive immunotherapy poses an obstacle. Genetically engineered artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs) consisting of K562 modified 4-1BBL and membrane bound IL-15 or IL-21 have been reported for their ability to support ex vivo NK cell proliferation. aAPCs with mbIL-21 were shown to promote increased proliferation of NK cells with shorter telomeres, but differences in in vivo survival or tumor or tissue migration have not been assessed. Tumor and/or tissue migration is primarily mediated by the expression of chemokine receptors. Using aAPCs bearing mbIL15 or mbIL21, we expanded NK cells for 3 weeks and assessed their expression of chemokine receptors, organ migration, and in vivo survival in a xenograft model. Propagated NK cells showed relatively similar levels of low to modest expression of CCR2, CCR7, CXCR4 and CXCR5, and high expression levels of CXCR3. Mean CCR5 expression levels were similar on cells that were positive, but CCR5 was expressed on a higher percentage of NK cells expanded with mbIL-15 than those expanded with mbIL-21. In contrast, about 20% of mbIL-21 expanded NK cells expressed CX3CR1 expression whereas mbIL-15 NK cells showed almost no expression of this receptor. Results from ongoing migration and survival experiments will also be presented. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
