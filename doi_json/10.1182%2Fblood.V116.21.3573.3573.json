    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3573 Background: In this randomized study we question the role of HDT, when new drugs are incorporated in the conventional treatment or in the autologous transplant setting in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Aims: To comp a re melph a l a n, prednisone a nd len a lidomide (MPR) with t a ndem melph a l a n (200 mg/m 2 ) (MEL200) in MM p a tients younger th a n 65 ye a rs. Methods: The induction treatment consisted of four 28-day cycles of lenalidomide (25 mg d 1\u201321) and low-dose dexamethasone (40 mg d 1,8,15,22) (Rd). Cyclophosphamide plus G-CSF was used to mobilize stem cells. As consolidation, patients were randomized to MPR (N=202) [six 28-day cycles of melphalan (0.18 mg/k g d 1\u20134), prednisone (2 mg/kg d 1\u20134) and lenalidomide (10 mg d 1\u201321))] or MEL200 (N=200)[tandem melphalan 200 mg/m 2 with stem-cell support]. A ll p a tients were a lso r a ndomized to receive either a spirin or low-molecul a r weight hep a rin (enoxaparin) a s thromboprophyl a xis during Rd and MPR. Primary study endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). D a t a were a n a lyzed in intention-to-tre a t. Results: From november 2007 to july 2009, 402 patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic MM younger than 65 years of age were recruited and randomized. All patients enrolled were stratified according to International Staging System (ISS) (stages 1 and 2 vs stage 3) and age (<60 vs \u226560 years). Results: On an intention to treat basis, best responses after Rd induction, were: partial response (PR) rate was 87%, very good partial response (VGPR) rate was 52%, including 13% complete responses (CR). The median yields of stem cells harvested was 8.7 \u00d710 6 CD34+ cells/Kg; 91% of patients collected the minimum dose of 4\u00d710 6 /kg CD34+ cells. As of August 10 th , 257 patients are evaluable for response after at least 3 cycles of MPR (124) and after the first MEL200 (133); best responses to consolidation: in the MPR group, the VGPR r a te w a s 60% including 20% CR; in the MEL200 group the VGPR r a te w a s 58% including 25% CRs. No differences in responses were reported a ccording to chromosomal a bnorm a lities, such a s del13, t(4;14), t(14;16) or del17p. After a median follow-up of 14 months, the projected 2-year PFS and OS were similar in the two groups ( table ). The achievement of at least VGPR after consolidation was a predictive factor of longer PFS in both groups: in the MEL200 group, the 2-year PFS was 92% for patients with at least VGPR vs 70% for those with PR (p<.0001); in the MPR group 86% vs 61% respectively (p<.0001). MPR and MEL200 were equally effective in patients with chromosomal abnormalities (2-year PFS was 71% vs 77%; p=.39) or ISS 3 (2-year PFS was 58% vs 66%; p=.48). Induction with Rd was well tolerated: the most frequent gr a de 3\u20134 a dverse events were neutropeni a (8%), a nemi a (7%), infections (4%) and skin r a sh (5%). The incidence of thromboembolic events w a s simil a r in p a tients r a ndomized to aspirin (2%) or low molecular weight heparin (1%) a s thromboprophyl a xis (p=.45). During consolid a tion, the incidence of gr a de 3\u20134 neutropeni a (97% vs 32%;p <.001), thrombocytopeni a (59% vs 5%; p<.001), infections (10% vs 1%, p<.001) a nd g a strointestin a l (15% vs 1%, p<.001) complic a tions w a s higher in MEL200 p a tients.

Both MPR and MEL200 improved the quality of response, achieved by Rd induction. At present, PFS a nd OS a re not signific a ntly different in the two groups, but longer follow-up is needed. These d a t a will be upd a ted a t the meeting.
