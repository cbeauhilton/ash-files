    "abstract_text": "We have shown that high IL-7 transgene (Tg) over-expression (39-fold at day 1 in thymic tissue) under the T cell specific, proximal lck promoter had a dose effect on TCR\u03b1\u03b2 that was accompanied by active B cell development in the thymus. To further characterize these affects in the thymus of IL-7 transgenic mice, we analyzed thymi from day 18 embryos and newborn Tg mice, as well as fetal thymic organ culture (FTOC) derived from using day 16 embryos. We show that arrested T-cell and increased B-cell thymic development is initiated during fetal development. Using mixed bone marrow chimeras and anti-IL-7 monoclonal antibody injection, we further demonstrate that abnormalities in thymic T and B cell development are non-cell autonomous and are due to IL-7 over-expression. Recently, it was shown that only the early thymocyte progenitor (ETP, c-kit + IL-7R \u2212/lo ) fraction within the DN1 subpopulation had a T-cell proliferative potential in contrast to the c-kit \u2212 IL-7R + DN1 subset. Here we show that in Tg mice the ETPs were decreased, while the c-kit \u2212 IL-7R + cells are increased in both percentage and absolute count when compared to normal controls. In order to explore the T vs. B ETP potential, we seeded re-aggregate thymic organ cultures with sorted lin \u2212 CD44 + CD25 \u2212 c-kit + IL-7R + cells. While ETPs derived from normal controls were able to proliferate and produce 83% of DP thymocytes, ETPs sorted from Tg mice developed poorly (10-fold less) into DP cells (30%) and produced 14% of B220 + cells vs. 6% in controls. Moreover, sorted Pro/Pre B derived thymic B cells from Tg mice, but not BM-derived Pro/Pre B cells had the TCR\u03b2D-J rearrangement, suggesting a T-specific origin. Since the B-cell differentiation pathway in normal mice is selectively inhibited by thymic presentation of Notch ligands, we hypothesized that IL-7 down-regulates Notch signaling. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed thymocyte progenitors (DN1-DN4) in normal and Tg mice for the intra-cytoplasmic part of Notch, that is cleaved upon Notch/Notch-ligand activation. Notch staining was decreased in the lin \u2212 CD44 + CD25 inter representing the only DN2 population present in these Tg mice. These data favour a decrease of Notch signalling in mice with high IL-7 Tg over-expression, inducing a block in TCR\u03b1\u03b2 development, and skewing of thymic B cell development by T vs. B lineage subversion. These conclusions may have implications for IL-7 in the clinical setting.",
