    "abstract_text": "Hypoxia-induced signalling is a major regulator in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. The transcription factor HIF-1alpha plays a crucial role in the quiescence and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells as well as leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) of acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia. Better understanding of the requirement of the molecular response to hypoxia in LICs could lead to new therapies targeting this pathway. We have therefore investigated the effect of HIF-1alpha loss on the phenotype and biology of FLT3-ITD induced myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Using a combined transgenic mouse model ( Mx1 -Cre; Hif-1alpha fl/fl ; Flt3 ITD/+ ) we showed that deletion of HIF-1alpha leads to a more severe MPN phenotype reflected by higher numbers of white blood cells and myeloid cells in peripheral blood, as well as a more severe splenomegaly. Loss of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs: Lin- Sca1+ cKit+ CD48- CD150+) and increased number of lineage-restricted progenitors (Lin- Sca1+ cKit+ CD48+ CD150-) were the most pronounced effects on a cellular level upon the loss of HIF-1alpha. The proliferative effect of the HIF-1alpha loss was cell intrinsic and not at the expense of the ability of the LICs to self-renew because the disease was transplantable into secondary recipients recapitulating the same phenotype. Mice transplanted with FLT3-ITD induced MPN lacking HIF-1alpha succumbed to their disease (average survival of 35 weeks after transplant), while animals transplanted with MPN with wild-type HIF-1alpha suffered from MPN but did not die in the observation period of 60 weeks. These findings are in contrary to what has been previously described for the role of HIF-1alpha in leukemia initiating cells and lead us to propose that HIF-1alpha could act as a tumor suppressor gene, inhibiting proliferation in myeloid malignancies. Our results provide evidence that targeting HIF-1alpha can lead to disease progression of MPN while not affecting self-renewal of LICs. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
