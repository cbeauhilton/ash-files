    "abstract_text": "Although sialic acid is considered a key determinant for the survival of circulating blood cells and glycoproteins, its role in platelet half-life is not fully clarified. We and others have previously provided evidence that thrombocytopenia in mice deficient in the ST3Gal-IV sialyltransferase gene (ST3Gal-IV \u2212/\u2212 mice) is caused by rapid clearance of the platelets due to recognition of surface galactose by asialoglycoprotein receptor-expressing scavenger cells. Here we report new insight into clearance mechanisms, activation and production of sialic acid deficient platelets. Immunofluorescence staining of organ specimens harvested shortly after platelet transfusion demonstrated the predominant clearance of ST3Gal-IV \u2212/\u2212 platelets by liver macrophages and, as previously reported, hepatocytes. The differential cellular clearance pathways were further explored following macrophage depletion in mice using clodronate encapsulated liposomes, a procedure that restored ST3Gal-IV \u2212/\u2212 platelet circulation to approximately 40% of normal values, confirming that macrophages play a major role in the clearance of sialic acid deficient platelets and that other clearance pathways are equally important. Ingestion of ST3Gal-IV \u2212/\u2212 platelets by hepatocytes was confirmed by in vitro HepG2 phagocytosis assays. We next investigated the function of desialylated platelets. Platelet binding of von Willebrand factor (vWf) upon botrocetin stimulation was 3 fold higher for ST3Gal-IV \u2212/\u2212 platelet rich plasma compared to ST3Gal- IV +/+ platelet rich plasma. The circulation time of wild-type platelets transfused into ST3Gal-IV \u2212/\u2212 mice was 20% reduced compared to control platelets, indicating that platelet removal could be accelerated due to binding of desialylated vWf to platelets. Loss of sialic acid did not affect platelet production in vitro and in vivo as cultivated megakaryocytes was found to produce proplatelets normally and measurements of reticulated platelets by flow cytometry showed a 3-fold increased thrombocytopoietic activity in the ST3Gal- IV \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to wild-type mice. Interestingly, thiazole orange staining revealed a significant negative correlation between platelet size and platelet age for both genotypes, In conclusion, depletion of the ST3Gal-IV gene promotes binding of vWf to platelets, exposes platelet surface galactose residues to the lectin domain of asialoglycoprotein receptors on both hepatocytes and liver macrophages, resulting in rapid platelet clearance from the circulation and supporting previous findings that platelets decrease in size while aging in circulation.",
