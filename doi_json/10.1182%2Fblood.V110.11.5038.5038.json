    "abstract_text": "Bone Marrow transplant activity started in 1999 in Pakistan when Bismillah Taqee Institute of Health Sciences & Blood Diseases Centre started functioning in the southern port city of Karachi, Pakistan. Two years later in year 2001 Armed Forces Bone Marrow Transplant Centre started functioning in the northern part of country, Rawalpindi, Pakistan. In 2004 another transplant centre, started in Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. Since the establishment of these transplant centers a total of 349 allogeneic transplants have been carried out for various hematological disorders. The major indications included aplastic anaemia (n=166), \u03b2-Thalassaemia major (n=76), chronic myeloid leukaemia (n=57), acute leukaemias (n=37) and misc disorders including MDS, Fanconi anaemia and others (n=13). A total of 22 autologous transplants in lymphomas and multiple myeloma have also been carried out. Since this number is very small, only data of allogeneic transplants is being presented here. Major post transplant complications encountered were neutropenic fever in 92.6% patients with 27% culture positivity (412/1571). Infective complications included bacterial infections (both gram+ive and gram-ive) in 194 patients (56%), fungal infection in 32 patients (10%), CMV infection in 15 patients (5%), herpes infection in 16 patients (5%), tuberculosis in 9 patients (3%) and PCP in 1 patient (0.28%) and malaria in 1 patient (0.28%). So post transplant infections were confirmed in 76.6% (268/349) patients on the basis of clinical assessment, microbiological, virological and histopathological analysis. Non infective post transplant complication included aGvHD (grade II-IV) in 80 patients (23%), cGvHD 46 patients (13.1%), VOD liver in 25 patients (7.2%), haemorrhagic cystitis in 27 patients (7.7%), ARF in 13 patients (3.7%), primary graft failure in 5 patients(1.4%), graft rejection in 17 patients (4.9%) and relapse in 14 patients (4%). Transplant related mortality was observed in 93 patients (26.6%). Infective & non infective causes of mortality included septicemia in 15 patients (4.3%), CMV in 8 patients (2.3%), fungal infections in 8 patients (2.3%), tuberculosis in 2 patient (0.6%). herpes encephalitis in 1 patient (0.3%) VOD in 8 patients (2.3%), aGvHD in 12 patients (3.4%), cGvHD in 7 patients (2.0%), ARF in 8 patients (2.3%) and intracranial haemorrhage in 3 patients (0.9%). Graft related mortality due to graft failure and relapse was observed in 6 patients (1.7%) and 14 patients (4%) respectively. Unrelated accidental death in 1 patient (0.3%). Overall survival was observed in 256 patients (73.3%) and DFS in 250 patients (71.6%). The OS and DFS was 72.7% and 70.9% in BTIHS & BDC patients, whereas OS & DFS was 72.8% and 70.7% respectively in AFBMTC patients. The OS & DFS was 82.6% at AKUH. Disease wise overall survival in aplastic anemia, \u03b2-Thalassaemia, CML and acute leukemia was 78.3%, 76.3%, 63.1% and 59.5% respectively."
