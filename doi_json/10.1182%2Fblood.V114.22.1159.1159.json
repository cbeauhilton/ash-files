However, the influence of such donor and recipient gene polymorphisms on other outcomes, such as early infection after SCT, has seldom been described. TNF\u03b1a, TNF receptorII (TNFRII), IL-10 and TGF gene contain multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter and codon region. We thus studied the association of this panel of candidate gene polymorphisms with the incidence of the first episodes of early bacterial infections within 100 days after allo-HSCT. Methods A total of 138 unrelated donor/recipient pairs, who had undergone HLA-matched allo-HSCT from January 2001 to March 2009 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, were tested for TNF\u03b1a(TNF\u03b1a-857 C>T, TNF\u03b1a-863 C>A, TNF\u03b1a-1031 T>C), TNFRII (codon196 T>G), IL-10 (IL10-1082 A>G, IL10-819 T>C, IL10-592 A>C), TGF (TGF-509 T>C, TGF+869 C>T) polymorphism allele frequencies and genotype. SNPs were analysed by Multiplex SnaPshot. We considered the first episodes of early bacterial infections within 100 days after allo-HSCT have developed when sepsis, pneumonia, or septic shock was diagnosed according to previously published criteria. Results (1) 133 patients achieved complete donor chimerism in the peripheral blood and 5 patients had graft failure. All patients achieved an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than 0.5\u00d7109/L at day 13 (7\u223c22) and platelet recovery at day 15 (7\u223c64). The cumulative incidence of at least one bacterial infection was 47.8% (pneumonia and intestinal infection are the most popular) within 100 days after allo-HSCT. There is no significant difference in the time to neutrophil recovery in patients who experienced early bacterial infections with those who did not (13.6 vs 12.8,P=0.115). (2) The TNF\u03b1a-857 C/C genotype and TNFRII 196 T/T genotype of the donor were significantly associated with a higher risk of early bacterial infection ( for TNF\u03b1a-857 C/C genotype: 53.3% vs 29.0%, P=0.024 ; TNFRII 196 T/T genotype: 53.5% vs 33.3%, P=0.038); (3) The TGF-509 T/T genotype of the donor was significantly associated with a higher risk of early bacterial infection (62.5% vs 41.8, P=0.038); (4) Transplantation from donors with IL10-819 C/C genotype or IL10-592 C/C genotype were significantly associated with a higher risk of early bacterial infection (for IL10-819 C/C genotype: 71.4.1% vs 45.3%, P=0.034; IL10-592 C/C genotype: 70.0.1% vs 45.8%, P=0.055); (5) The genotypes of TNF\u03b1a-863, TNF\u03b1a-1031, IL10-1082 and TGF+869 were not found to be associated with the risk of early bacterial infection. Conclusions Recent studies have shown that the generation potential of IL-10 is influenced by the polymorphism of the IL-10 gene. The IL10-819*C allele and IL10-592 *C allele are associated with higher secretion of IL-10 than IL10-819*T allele and IL10-592*A allele. In our data, a higher risk of early bacterial infection with IL10-819 C/C and IL10-592 C/C genotype was postulated to be associated with a higher IL-10 production, which suppressed reactive T-cell response. These results, which is the first report of TNF\u03b1a, TNFRII, IL-10and TGF polymorphic features of Chinese population with the risk of early bacterial infection after HLA-matched unrelated allo-HSCT, suggest an interaction of the donor TNF\u03b1a-857C/C, TNFRII 196 T/T, IL10-819 C/C, IL10-592 C/C and TGF-509 T/T genotypes on risk of early infection. These results are helpful for predict allo-HSCT outcome, identify more suitable donors and clarify therapy on an individual patient basis. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
