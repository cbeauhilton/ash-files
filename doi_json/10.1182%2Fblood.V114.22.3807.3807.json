    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3807 Poster Board III-743 Background Lenalidomide has high erythroid remitting activity in patients with del(5q) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The actual recommendation is to continue drug administration until relapse of red blood cell transfusion dependence. We address the question whether it is safe and advisable to discontinue lenalidomide after achieving a hematologic and/or cytogenetic response Patients 13 patients (8 female, 5 male) were treated with lenalidomide between December 2003 and January 2007. Median age was 69 years. All had low- or intermediate-1 risk MDS with del(5q) chromosomal abnormality. All patients were red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependent. All patients started treatment with 5 or 10 mg lenalidomide for 28 out of 28 days or for 21 out of 28 days. Discontinuation of lenalidomide was usually due to patient's choice, and occurred after achievement of RBC transfusion independence. Lenalidomide administration duration ranged from 6 weeks to 24 months Results Four patients had a total lenalidomide exposure of > 12 months (12, 15, 18 and 24 months), seven patients between 4 and 12 months and two patients had lenalidomide exposures of 12 months of CCR achievement. They are transfusion independent for 27+ months, 41+ months, and 66+ months. The latter patient had reoccurrence of one metaphase out of 20 with del(5q) after 60 months. Finally, one patient took lenalidomide only six months beyond CCR and remains in transfusion independence for 70+ months. However, this patient was trated with a fludarabine-containing regimen for follicular lymphoma 48 months ago Discussion Discontinuation of lenalidomide seems to be feasible in patients with del(5q) MDS, preferably in those who achieve CCR. Best results regarding long-term transfusion independence and long-term complete cytogenetic remissions are seen in patients who continue lenalidomide for 12 months after CCR achievement.
