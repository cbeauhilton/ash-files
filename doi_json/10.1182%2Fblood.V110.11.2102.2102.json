    "abstract_text": "Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is the physiologic mechanism that serves for controlled deletion of unwanted cells. Apoptosis was initially attributed exclusively to nucleated cells but over the past decade it has been recognized that apoptosis also occurs in anucleated cytoplasts and platelets. In this study, using flow cytometry we analyzed in human platelets three critical manifestations of mitochondrial, cytoplasmic and plasma membrane apoptosis, mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential (\u0394\u03c8m) depolarization, caspase-3 activation and phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, respectively. We found that these hallmarks of apoptosis can be induced in human platelet suspension by diverse stimuli, including human \u03b1-thrombin (1, 10, 100 nM), calcium ionophore A23187 (3, 5, 10 \u03bcM), high shear stresses generated by cone-and-plate viscometer (120, 200, 390 dyn/cm 2 ) and prolonged storage of platelet concentrates in blood banking conditions at 22\u00b0C for 6 and 13 days. We also demonstrated that these apoptotic markers can be induced in mouse platelets in vivo in a murine model of immune thrombocytopenia caused by injection of anti-glycoprotein (GP) IIb (rat anti-mouse GPIIb, MWReg30) antibody. Other manifestations of apoptosis were detected in human platelets, including expression of proapoptotic members of Bcl-2 family proteins (Bax and Bak) induced by thrombin, and platelet shrinkage and shedding of microparticles induced by high shear stresses. In addition to apoptosis in fluid-phase platelets, apoptosis was also revealed by confocal fluorescent microscopy in adherent human platelets and thrombi-like platelet aggregates deposited on thrombogenic immobilized human vascular collagen types I and III, as detected by PS exposure and shedding of PS-exposed microparticles. Taken together, these data suggest that platelet apoptosis is a phenomenon that can be triggered by a wide diversity of chemical and physical stimuli using different mechanisms mediated by thrombin-, collagen- and integrin GPIIbIIIa-receptors, mechanoreceptors and Ca 2+ -overloading. These stimuli trigger platelet apoptosis by impacting on several intracellular apoptotic targets, including shifting the balance between Bcl-2 regulatory proteins in a proapoptotic direction, depolarizing the inner mitochondrial membrane, activating the executioner caspase-3, stimulating aberrant PS exposure on the platelet surface and, eventually, resulting in \u2018terminal\u2019 stages of platelet apoptosis, such as platelet shrinkage and shedding of PS-exposed microparticles resembling apoptotic bodies. Platelet apoptosis can be induced both in fluid-phase and adherent platelets and thrombi-like platelet aggregates. These data also indicate that natural PL agonists thrombin and subendothelial vascular collagens and hemodynamic shear forces, can be involved not only in the processes of hemostasis, thrombosis and blood coagulation but also can trigger platelet death via apoptosis. Platelet apoptosis may contribute to the pathophysiology of thrombocytopenia in diseases associated with enhanced thrombin generation, such as sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation, as well as in autoimmune and alloimmune thrombocytopenias.",
