    "abstract_text": "Background Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the accumulation of clonal B cells in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen. This is due to a combined effect of deferred apoptosis with slow, but persistent proliferation of malignant cells. In CLL, tumor-sustaining homeostasis is critically maintained by the ubiquitin proteasome system. The proteasome mediates degradation of various transcription factors such as TP53 as well as upholding a balance between the anti and pro apoptotic proteins of the BCL2 family. Previous studies have demonstrated that the clinical course of the disease is negatively associated with malfunctioning apoptotic pathways that result in increased levels of BCL2. Thus, identification and correction of defects that affect programmed cell death offer therapeutic vantage to reset and engage cell death pathways in CLL. Aim Examination of the anti-CLL properties of the investigational agent MLN2238 (Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA) and its ability to inhibit the proteasomal machinery; induce CLL cell death and downregulate BCL2. MLN2238 activity was also investigated in conjunction with anti-CLL therapies such as fludarabine and dexamethasone along with the BH3 mimetic BCL2 inhibitor, AT-101 (Ascenta Pharmaceuticals, Malvern, PA). Methods CLL cells with >90% CD19+ tumor population were obtained from 28 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CLL. Proteasomal activity was measured using synthetic fluorogenic peptide substrates. Apoptosis was measured by annexin-v/PI staining, and mitochondrial membrane permeability (MOMP) was assessed using TMRM followed by flow cytometry. Protein profiles were ascertained by western blot. Results MLN2238 inhibited the chymotrypsin-like proteasomal activity by more than 90% (p<0.005) in all patient samples without altering PSMB5 protein levels. Moderate to minimal inhibitory effect on caspase-like and trypsin-like proteasomal activities, respectively, was also noted. CLL cells showed a concentration dependent decrease in viability in response to treatment with MLN2238 at an IC 50 of 50 nM. MLN2238 treated cells underwent apoptosis in a dose dependent manner with a median dose effect (cell death) observed in 42% of cells at 25 nM (range 10% - 54%) and 60% of cells at a 50 nM concentration (range, 25% - 73%). PARP-1 and caspase-3 cleavage along with an increase in MOMP was also noted after CLL cells were treated with MLN2238; however, apoptosis was only partially blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD.fmk. BCL2 downregulation was dose-dependent and was observed as early as 12 hours. We sought to determine whether directly disrupting BCL2 function with AT-101 could enhance the anti-CLL effects of MLN2238. When used at sub-IC 50 concentrations, AT1-10 synergized with MLN2238 to induce CLL cell death. Synergy was also observed when MLN2238 was paired with the cytotoxic agent fludarabine, whereas the combination of MLN2238 and dexamethasone resulted in additive anti-CLL activity. Conclusion While PI have made an important impact in various B cell cancers, their role in CLL has not been well established. We investigated preclinically, a novel PI and noted that targeting the proteasome with MLN2238 resulted in lethal events in CLL cells, which were further enhanced by disruption of the BCL2 prosurvival pathway. Moreover, proteasome disruption sensitized CLL cells to the cytotoxic effect of fludarabine, an important therapeutic in CLL. These data provides the mechanistic basis for evaluation of MLN2238 in CLL through rationale design of drug combination strategies based on CLL biology.
