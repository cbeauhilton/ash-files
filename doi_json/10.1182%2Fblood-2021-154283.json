    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Patients (pts) with blood disorders are at particular risk for severe infection and death from COVID-19. Factors that contribute to this risk, including cancer treatment, have not been clearly delineated. The ASH RC COVID-19 Registry for Hematology is a public-facing, volunteer registry reporting outcomes of COVID-19 infection in pts with underlying blood disorders. We report a multivariable analysis of the impact of cancer treatment and other key variables on COVID-19 mortality and hospitalization among pts with blood cancer. METHODS: Data were collected between April 1, 2020, and July 2, 2021. All analyses were performed using R version 4.0.2. Multivariable logistic regression explored associations between mortality and seven patient/disease factors previously reported as important to COVID-19 outcome. Independent variables included: age (>60); sex; presence of a major comorbidity (defined as any of heart disease, hypertension, pulmonary disease and/or diabetes); type of hematologic malignancy; estimated prognosis of < 6 months prior to COVID-19; deferral of ICU care; and administration of cancer treatment in the previous year (excluding single agent hydroxyurea). A secondary multivariable logistic regression explored associations between the same variables and hospitalization with COVID-19. RESULTS: We included all pts in the registry with a malignant diagnosis except for 3 patients excluded based on a data sharing agreement (N=1029). Median age category was 50-59y (range  90y). The sample was 42% female and 28% had major comorbidities. Types of hematologic malignancies were 354 (34%) acute leukemia/MDS, 255 (25%) lymphoma, 206 (20%) plasma cell dyscrasia (myeloma/amyloid/POEMS), 116 (11%) CLL, 98 (10%) myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Most pts (73%) received cancer treatment during the previous year, 9% had a pre-COVID-19 prognosis of  60 (OR 2.03, 1.31-3.18), male sex (OR 1.69, 1.11 - 2.61), estimated pre-COVID-19 prognosis of less than 6 months (OR 6.16, 3.26 - 11.70) and ICU deferral (OR 10.87, 6.36 - 18.96) were all independently associated with an increased risk of death. Receiving cancer treatment in the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and type of hematologic malignancy were not significantly associated with death. In multivariable analyses, age > 60 (OR 2.46, 1.83 - 3.31), male sex (OR 1.34, 1.02 - 1.76), estimated pre-COVID-19 prognosis of < 6 months (OR 4.81, 2.45 - 10.50), presence of a major comorbidity (OR 1.57, 1.15 - 2.16), and cancer treatment in the previous year (OR 1.50, 1.10 - 2.06) were all independently associated with an increased risk of a severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Pts with a MPN or plasma cell dyscrasia and COVID-19 were less likely to require hospitalization for COVID-19 compared to patients with CLL, leukemia/MDS, or lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses confirm the negative impact of age > 60, male sex, pre-COVID-19 prognosis of < 6 months, and deferral of ICU care on mortality among patients with hematologic malignancy and COVID-19. We did not observe an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality among pts with COVID-19 who received blood cancer treatment in the previous year, although rate of hospitalization was higher. Pts with some hematologic malignancies (MPN, plasma cell dyscrasias), may experience less severe COVID-19 infections than others.
