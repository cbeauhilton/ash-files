    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Increases in plasma von Willebrand Factor (vWF) levels, accompanied by decreases in its respective metalloprotease, ADAMTS13, have been demonstrated in diseases of microvascular injury. We hypothesized that following severe trauma, a burst of ultra-large vWF (UL-vWF) is released into the bloodstream by damaged endothelium, resulting in increased thrombogenicity due to circulating vWF multimers. We further hypothesized that traumatic injury would lead to a deficit of ADAMTS13, promoting the accumulation of UL-vWF forms and, ultimately, the increased risk of microvascular disease, such as acute kidney injury (AKI). Methods: A cohort of 37 severely injured trauma patients was analyzed for antigen levels of plasma vWF and ADAMTS13 at 0- and 24-hours after admission. Circulating vWF multimeric composition from both time points was determined by vertical agarose gel electrophoresis. Multivariate analyses were performed with data abstracted from the electronic medical records to identify further dependences. A similar analysis was also performed on plasma from a cohort of 8 patients with trauma induced AKI at 0-, 24-, and 72-hours after admission; these patients were well matched against trauma patients without AKI. Finally, we utilized a murine model of polytrauma and hemorrhage, in conjunction with qRT-PCR of ADAMTS13 in total liver RNA, to specifically address how the expression of ADAMTS13 is altered by the systemic effects of traumatic injury. Results: Circulating vWF levels were increased in severe trauma patients when compared to healthy controls at presentation (189% (110-263) vs. 95% (74-120)) and persisted through 24-hours (213% (146-257) vs. 132% (57-160)). Ultra-large vWF forms were elevated at both 0- and 24-hours when compared to pooled normal plasma ((10.0% (8.9-14.3) and 11.3% (9.1-21.2), respectively, vs 0.6%). The largest vWF forms within trauma patient plasma circulated at 33\u00b14 dimers vs 18\u00b11 dimer in length within pooled normal plasma. Severe trauma patient ADAMTS13 activity was decreased at 0-hours (66% (47-86) vs. 100% (98-100)) and at 24-hours (72.5% (56-87.3) vs 103% (103-103)) when compared to healthy patients. Furthermore, the proportion of circulating low molecular weight multimeric (LMWM) vWF to total circulating vWF forms was directly dependent upon ADAMTS13 activity at 24-hours (Decreased ADAMTS13 Activity: 20.4% (15.0-22.7) LMWM vWF vs Normal Activity: 25.8% (22.7-35.2) LMWM vWF). Strikingly, ADAMTS13 activity independently predicted the development of coagulopathy, correlating with presentation INR (\u03c1 =-0.63), activated clotting time of thromboelastography (TEG) (\u03c1=-0.36), and TEG maximum amplitude (\u03c1=0.36). ADAMTS13 activity also closely correlated with injury severity (ISS) (\u03c1=-0.34) and blood product transfusion (\u03c1 =-.45). The cohort of 8 trauma patients who went on to develop AKI showed a 1.54-fold (1.02-2.05) increase in plasma vWF antigen levels between 0 and 72 hours, while those who did not develop AKI showed no change in vWF levels over this time period. Furthermore, those who developed AKI demonstrated a smaller proportion of LMWM vWF in plasma than those who did not (25.4% (23.4-28.0) vs 31.2% (27.2-35.6)), suggesting the increased thrombogenicity of their circulating vWF forms. Finally, qRT-PCR of total liver RNA in 6 mice demonstrated a 2-fold decrease in ADAMTS13 RNA expression levels between the times immediately before and 24-hours after trauma. Altogether, these data indicate that both circulating ADAMTS13 and its production are deficient in the days following severe injury. Conclusions: Severe traumatic injury alters the circulating composition of ADAMTS13 and its target, vWF, shifting their equilibrium to one that promotes thrombosis. Not only is the concentration of circulating ADAMTS13 decreased following traumatic injury, but hepatic expression of the enzyme is lacking as well. In the immediate moments following injury, these mechanisms contribute to life-saving hemostasis; however, as these changes extend into the following days, the early hemostatic benefit quickly shifts to burden that may exacerbate microvascular disease.
