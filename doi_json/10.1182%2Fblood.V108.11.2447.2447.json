    "abstract_text": "The treatment of Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) and the predictive variables of response to chemotherapy and survival are largely discussed. The French Goelams group conducted between 1996 and 2000, a first line phase II prospective trial for MCL patients to test the efficacy of the VAD+C regimen, explore the effect of ASCT on patients under 60 and identify prognostic factors. Treatment: it consisted for the first step of 4 cycles of VAD+C regimen (classical VAD with vincristine, adriblastine, dexamethasone associated with chlorambucil 12 mg/D from D20 to D29. interval between two cycles 35 days). The responders (cheson criteria) went to the second step wich consisted of 4 other VAD+C regimen for patients over 60 years or for patients under 61 years, 2 other VAD+C regimen followed by a ASCT with preparative regimen including Alkeran 140 and a 8 grays TBI. Results: 90 patients were included and finally 74 retained after the pathologic review. Fifty (78%) were common forms and 24 blastoid variants. For the 74 eligible patients (40 under 61years and 34 over 60), the ORR after 4 cycles of VAD+C was 73% and 46% of the patients were in CR/CRu. ASCT influenced significantly the PFS, with a median survival of 20 months for non transplanted patients versus 37 months for ASCT recipients (p=0,001) and showed a tendency for a better OS (p=0.07). Six independent prognostic factors (PF) were identified as influencing OS: blastic variants, LDH level, lymphocytosis>5G/L, MIB1proliferation index, performance status and B symptoms. This allows to propose a new prognostic index which stratifies patients at diagnosis into 3 prognostic groups, with 0 or 1 PF (n=34, 46%), 2 or 3 PF (n=29, 39%) and 4 or more PF (n=11, 15%). For these three groups, median OS was respectively of 68, 41 and 7 months (p=0.0001). Conclusion: The VAD+C regimen thus appears as a good regimen for MCL with few prognosis factors, which can effectively be completed by an ASCT for young responders\u2019 patients."
