    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1047 Poster Board I-69 Background: A major issue in the treatment of AML is the low response rate achieved with standard remission induction therapy in patients with \u201cpoor-risk\u201d prognostic factors. One such poor-risk factor is secondary AML (sAML), AML following myelodysplasia or cytotoxic therapy for other malignancies. sAML is strongly associated with multi-drug resistance (MDR) mechanisms: up to 70% of sAML patients show overexpression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) or other MDR mechanisms. Amonafide L-malate (amonafide, AS1413) is a unique DNA intercalator that is not a substrate for MDR, unlike anthracyclines commonly used in the treatment of AML. This phase II study evaluated amonafide in combination with cytarabine in patients with sAML. Methods: Patients received amonafide 600 mg/m 2 /day IV on days 1-5 and cytarabine 200 mg/m 2 /day IV by continuous infusion on days 1-7. Induction was repeated if leukemia persisted on day 14 marrow examination. Consolidation consisted of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT; n=10) or intermediate-dose (n=13)/high-dose (n=7) cytarabine, depending on age and HSCT donor availability. Bone marrows were centrally reviewed. The primary endpoint was complete remission with (CR) or without (CRi) hematopoietic recovery; secondary endpoints were duration of remission (DOR), survival and safety. Results: 88 patients with a median age of 62.5 years (range 23-87) were treated; Of these, 45 (51%) had received prior leukemogenic therapy (tAML) and 43 (49%) had prior MDS; 1 (1%) had favorable, 36 (41%) had intermediate and 42 (48%) had unfavorable cytogenetics. Overall CR + CRi rate was 42% (CRi 3%); median duration of remission (DOR) was 312 days. CR rates and DOR among age  500/cmm and platelets of 20,000/cmm was 29 and 28 days, respectively. Conclusions: Amonafide produced a high complete remission rate and durable responses in both older and younger patients with sAML. Efficacy was maintained across several poor-prognosis subgroups frequently characterized by MDR, for which amonafide is not a substrate. A phase III study (ACCEDE) is evaluating amonafide + cytarabine vs. daunorubicin + cytarabine in patients with sAML.
