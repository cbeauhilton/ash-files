    "abstract_text": "Introduction and objectives: Development of neutralising inhibitors against factor VIII (FVIII) is one of the most serious and costly complications in the treatment of HA. An ongoing international, open-label, uncontrolled, multicentre observational study, ObsITI (ClinicalTrials.gov. NCT 02207894) started in 2005 to assess immune tolerance induction (ITI), the standard of care in patients with inhibitors. The study evaluates patient- and therapy-related variables on ITI course, outcome and morbidity in HA patients with inhibitors. ObsITI satellite studies additionally look at other factors related to tolerisation. Methods and Materials: As of February 2018, 193 patients from 20 countries undergoing ITI have been recruited in ObsITI. 152 patients completed the study and 41 are ongoing. A subgroup of more than 80 prospective patients were treated exclusively during the complete ITI course with a single plasma-derived (pd) FVIII concentrate that contains von Willebrand factor (VWF) in a VWF/FVIII ratio of 0.4 (Octapharma AG). According to the recommended Bonn protocol, low responders at ITI start received 50-100 IU FVIII kg-1 daily, or every other day; high responders received 100 IU FVIII kg-1 every 12 hours. Results: In this ongoing study, the majority of patients treated with the pdFVIII/VWF product achieved a negative inhibitor titre. ITI outcome was significantly correlated with the bleeding rate during ITI, the peak titre during ITI, the inhibitor titre at start of ITI >10 BU, and the number of poor prognosis factors. Conclusion: Treatment with this particular pdFVIII/VWF concentrate, mainly according to the Bonn protocol, resulted in a high ITI success rate in HA patients with inhibitors and corroborates previously published success rates (77.1% complete/partial success in 48 inhibitor patients undergoing ITI with the same product).
