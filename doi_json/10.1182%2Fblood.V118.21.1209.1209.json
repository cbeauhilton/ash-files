    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1209 Background: The presence of autoimmune antibodies directed to beta2-glycoprotein-I (B2GPI) often leads to thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and fondaparinux are commonly used for prophylaxis and treatment of thromboses in APS. These drugs bind and activate antithrombin III to inactivate blood clotting proteases. Fondaparinux is a synthetic pentasaccharide matching a specific sequence within heparin interacting with antithrombin. Aim: We investigated if fondaparinux can bind B2GPI and ameliorate prothrombotic properties of B2GPI/anti-B2GPI antibody complexes. Results: We found that fondaparinux interacts with B2GPI and that the binding is dominated by electrostatic interactions. We measured the binding affinity by monitoring changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of domain V of B2GPI (B2GPI-DV) upon titration with fondaparinux. In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, the binding affinity was about 1.5 uM and stoichiometry of the binding is 1:1. Using solution NMR spectroscopy, we determined that the binding interface of the complex is centered on Lys251 of B2GPI-DV. This observation was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. The Lys251/Asp mutant fails to bind B2GPI-DV. Interestingly, the binding site for fondaparinux on B2GPI does not overlap with the major binding site for heparin. Cellular activation by the binding of B2GPI/anti-B2GPI antibody complexes with cell-surface receptors (among them ApoER2, a lipoprotein receptor from the LDLR family) and interference with the protective function of annexin V on anionic phospholipids expressed on the surfaces of activated cells are two potential prothrombotic mechanisms of B2GPI/antibody complexes. We found that fondaparinux does not prevent the association of the ligand-binding modules from ApoER2 with B2GPI-DV. Therefore, fondaparinux does not interfere with the binding of B2GPI/anti-B2GPI antibody complexes with lipoprotein receptors. Neither fondaparinux, nor heparin and LMWH were effective in inhibiting the binding of B2GPI/anti-B2GPI antibody complexes to cardiolipin-coated plates suggesting that these drugs do not prevent the destructive effect of B2GPI/antibody complexes on antithrombotic function of annexin V. Conclusions: At therapeutic concentrations, fondaparinux forms only small number of complexes with B2GPI, given that the binding affinity of the complex is in a micromolar range. When bound to B2GPI, fondaparinux does not interfere with the binding of B2GPI/anti-B2GPI antibody complexes to lipoprotein receptors and anionic phospholipids.
