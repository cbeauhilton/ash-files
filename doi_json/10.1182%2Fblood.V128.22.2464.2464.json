    "abstract_text": "Recent studies demonstrated that IGF2BP1 over-expression (IGF2BP1-OE) in adult erythroblasts has robust effects on fetal hemoglobin (HbF; >65% of the total globin levels), accompanied by reversal of the beta-like globin expression patterns to a fetal-like phenotype. Here we investigated if another member of the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein family, IGF2BP3, also has potential for HbF regulation that may be useful for therapeutic application among patients with beta-hemoglobin disorders. The developmental pattern and expression levels for IGF2BP3 were initially determined in cord blood versus adult blood CD34(+) samples cultivated ex vivo in erythropoietin-supplemented serum-free media for 21 days. RNA samples were collected at culture day 14 and expression levels were measured by qRT-PCR. IGF2BP3 showed a developmentally regulated expression pattern similar to IGF2BP1 ( IGF2BP1 : cord blood: 1.3.E+03 \u00b1 4.3.E+02 and adult blood: below detection limits; IGF2BP3 : cord blood: 5.8.E+02 \u00b1 2.4.E+02 and adult blood: below detection limits). These results were confirmed in vivo by comparing human fetal liver to adult bone marrow samples ( IGF2BP1 : fetal liver: 3.5.E+02 \u00b1 5.7.E+01, adult bone marrow: below detection limits and IGF2BP3 : fetal liver: 2.0.E+01 \u00b1 2.7.E+00, adult bone marrow: below detection limits). To investigate the effects of IGF2BP3 upon erythropoiesis and globin expression, a lentiviral construct was designed for expression of IGF2BP3 driven by the erythroid-specific gene promoter region of the human SPTA1 gene (IGF2BP3-OE), with a matched empty vector control. Transductions were performed in CD34(+) cells from four adult healthy volunteers cultivated ex vivo in erythropoietin-supplemented serum-free media for 21 days. Over-expression of IGF2BP3 was confirmedby qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses at culture day 14. IGF2BP3-OE cells maintained their ability to differentiate and enucleate ex vivo compared to donor-matched controls. The expression levels of globin genes were evaluated at culture day 14 by qRT-PCR and showed that IGF2BP3-OE caused significantly increased gamma-globin expression levels compared to control transductions (control: 7.7.E+05 \u00b1 1.7.E+05; IGF2BP3-OE: 8.4.E+06 \u00b1 3.2.E+06; p=0.018). Consistent with increased gamma-globin , HbF rose to moderately high levels upon IGF2BP3-OE (control: 4.0 \u00b1 2.1%; IGF2BP3-OE: 18.6 \u00b1 1.0%; p=0.0021). In addition, the expression pattern of the erythroid transcription factor BCL11A was investigated by qRT-PCR at culture day 14 and no significant changes were observed (control: 5.6.E+02 \u00b1 2.7.E+02; IGF2BP3-OE: 6.7.E+02 \u00b1 3.5.E+02; p=0.694). However, minor decreases in BCL11A protein levels were detected by Western analysis. These results demonstrate that IGF2BP3 is developmentally regulated in human erythroid tissues with silencing during the fetal-to-adult transition. However, the effects of IGF2BP3-OE on HbF levels were less robust when compared to IGF2BP1-OE in cultured adult erythroblasts. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
