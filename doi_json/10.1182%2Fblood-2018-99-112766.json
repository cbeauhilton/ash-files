    "abstract_text": "The current view is that treatment failures of AML patients are due to persistence of leukemia stem cells (LSCs). The presence of FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) Internal tandem duplication (ITD) is associated with poor prognosis. But, FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) demonstrate transient clinical activity in FLT3-ITD + AML patients. Persistent FLT3-ITD + AML LSC represent a source of relapse. There is a pressing need to target LSC and improve outcomes for FLT3-ITD + AML patients. PRMT1, the predominant arginine methyltransferase, has been implicated in pathogenesis of AML rare subtype (i.e., acute megakaryoblastic leukemia). Herein, we show that PRMT1 protein expression is significantly increased in LSC-enriched AML CD34 + CD38 - cells relative to the counterparts of normal peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) (AML n=9, normal n=8, p =0.0004,). Following PRMT1-knockdown (KD), AML CD34 + cells (n=15) demonstrated varying degrees of apoptosis while the survival of normal cells were not affected. Interestingly, we observed significant apoptosis-induction in a subset of samples bearing FLT3-ITD mutation (6 out of total 15) upon PRMT1-KD (ShCtrl 13.9\u00b13.6%, ShPRMT1 32.5\u00b14.6%, p<0.001). PRMT1-KD induced apoptosis was also more evident in cord blood (CB) CD34 + cells expressing FLT3-ITD (ShCtrl 19.4\u00b11.3%, ShPRMT1 45.2\u00b12.5%, p<0.001) relative to that of FLT3-WT (ShCtrl 27.47\u00b11.8%, ShPRMT1 36.9\u00b11.6%, p=0.0167). In 293T cells ectopically overexpressing FLT3-WT or FLT3-ITD, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) indicated greater interaction between PRMT1 and FLT3-ITD. Through RNA-Seq profiling two AML lines (MV4-11, OCI-AML3) plus one FLT3-ITD transduced CB CD34 + cells with PRMT1-KD, we obtained a differentially-regulated gene set as a \"PRMT1 signature\". This signature was enriched in FLT3-ITD + AML relative to FLT3-WT AML according to ssGSEA analysis using two AML datasets (GSE14468, GSE10358), indicating PRMT1 may cooperate with FLT3-ITD regulating AML maintenance. Given that PRMT1 directly interacts with FLT3-ITD, we next asked whether PRMT1 catalyzes FLT3-ITD protein methylation. Through mass-spectrometry analysis of a FLT3-ITD + AML specimen and in vitro methylation assay, we identified that PRMT1 catalyzes FLT3-ITD arginine (R) methylation (Me) at two conserved residues, 972 and 973. Using in-house R972/973 Me antibody, we validated the expression of FLT3 R-Me in FLT3-ITD AML speciemens (7 out of 7). To test R-Me function, we transduced MLL-AF9 (MA9) overexpressing murine c-Kit + cells with methylation-deficient FLT3-ITD (R972/973K, arginine [R] to lysine [K]) construct, and found that MA9 cells expressing R972/973K underwent more apoptosis than that of WT FLT3-ITD (WT FLT3-ITD 9.7\u00b11.1%, R972/973K 23.7\u00b12.1%, p=0.003). The double transformed cells were further transplanted into recipients for leukemia development. Mice receiving MA9 cells expressing R972/973K exhibited longer survival (median survival: WT FLT3-ITD 36 days, R972/973K 50 days, p =0.002, n=6). Mechanistically, expression of R972/973K did not affect the total tyrosine phosphorylation level of FLT3-ITD. Additionally, FLT3-ITD R-Me expression persisted after a TKI (AC220) treatment. These facts indicated that FLT3-ITD R-Me function is independent of FLT3-ITD kinase activity. We then used a FLT3-ITD + patient derived xenograft (PDX) model to assess the effects of TKI and PRMT1 inhibition. Following engraftment >1% in peripheral blood, we divided mice (n=24) into 4 groups and treated each with vehicle, MS023 (a type I PRMT inhibitor, ACS Chem Biol. 2016;11:772-781 ) (160 mg/kg/i.p), AC220 (10 mg/kg/i.g) or combination for 4 weeks. MS023 treatment downregulating FLT3 R-Me levels enhanced elimination of FLT3-ITD AML cells by AC220 treatment (AC220 24.6\u00b113.4% vs combination 7.6\u00b16.5%, p =0.02, n=6). At 16 weeks post-secondary BMT, significant AML burden in single drug treated transplants was observed, but less AML cells were detected in combination-treated transplants (AC220 52.3%, vs combination 25.4%, p<0.001, n=6). MS023 had little effect on long-term in vivo engraftment of CD34 + from a human CB specimen (vehicle 76.3\u00b15.9%, MS023 72.2\u00b13.4%, p =0.21, n=5). In summary, our study demonstrated PRMT1 overexpression contributes to AML stem/progenitor cell survival possibly through FLT3-ITD methylation, supporting further exploration into how PRMT1-mediated FLT3 methylation governs LSC survival.
