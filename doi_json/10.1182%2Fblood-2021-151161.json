    "abstract_text": "Background: Despite significant advances in therapeutic options for multiple myeloma (MM) patients, there is an ongoing need to identify effective treatment strategies in the relapsed space. The efficacy of daratumumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone (DPD) in relapsed and/or refractory patients has been demonstrated in clinical trials, but there is limited data at first relapse in a real world setting. Here, we present a retrospective analysis utilizing our institutional data of multiple myeloma patients treated with DPD at first relapse at the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University. Methods: Ninety relapsed and/or refractory myeloma (RRMM) patients were identified who had received only one prior line of therapy and subsequently treated with DPD at first relapse. Dose-adjustments were made based on the treating physician's discretion and patient tolerability. Demographic and outcomes data for the patients were obtained from our IRB approved myeloma database and responses were evaluated per IMWG Uniform Response Criteria. Results: The median age of this cohort was 61.9 years (range, 38-85). Other notable patient characteristics include: M/F 44.4%/55.6%; W/AA/Asian 50%/46.7%/3.3%; ISS I/II/III 28.9%/31.1%/20%; Isotype IgG/IgA/FLC 62.2%/17.8%/16.7%; standard risk/high risk 21.1%/52.2%. High risk disease was defined as the presence of t(4;14), t(14;16), del(17p), and/or complex karyotype. A total of 69 patients (76.7%) underwent autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) upfront after attaining at least a partial response with induction therapy. The most common induction regimen was RVD (78.9%). 81.1% of patients received maintenance therapy, with 50.5% receiving single-agent lenalidomide maintenance and 72.2% receiving a lenalidomide-based maintenance regimen (RVD: 8 pts; Rd: 4 pts; IRD: 7 pts, KRD: 1 pt). With a median follow up of 72 months, the median OS from diagnosis was 158.6 months (95% CI 126.7-190.5) for the entire cohort. The median PFS from time of initiation of DPD was 15.6 months (95% CI 9.9-21.2), and the median OS from time of initiation of DPD was 41.3 months. For high risk vs standard risk patients, the mPFS from time of initiation of DPD was 7.2 months (95% CI 3.6-10.7) vs 17.6 months (95% CI 10.9-24.3), respectively. Median PFS2 in patients 2 years from transplant was 8.6 months vs NR, respectively. Conclusions: These results illustrate the activity of DPD at first relapse in a predominantly len-refractory RRMM cohort of patients with impressive long-term outcomes. This benefit was particularly demonstrated in patients with time to relapse of >2 years post-transplant.
