    "abstract_text": "This study's objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin (GEMOX) as a salvage regimen in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma. Twenty-five patients were enrolled. All patients had received \u2265 2 prior chemotherapy regimens, had an ECOG performance status \u2264 2 and had adequate organ function. Patients received intravenous gemcitabine (1000 mg/m 2 ) and oxaliplatin (100 mg/m 2 ) on days 1 and 15, every 4 weeks. The median age was 29 years (range, 18-64) and 16 (68%) were male. Twenty-one (84%) had primary refractory disease (n=13) or relapsed within 12 months after initial therapy (n=8). All had previous platinum-based salvage chemotherapy (ICE, 23; DHAP, 2). Ten patients (40%) had relapsed/refractory disease following autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). None had previous brentuximab vedotin treatment. Twenty-one (84%) patients were refractory or progressive on the last treatment. Median number of previous lines of chemotherapy was 2 (range, 2-4). Median number of GEMOX cycles administered to the patients was 3 (range, 2-6). Treatment response was evaluated with PET-CT before and 2-3 cycles after treatment, and those patients who demonstrated a response continued to receive a maximum of 6 courses of GEMOX or bridged to SCT. Of 25 patients, 2 (8%) had complete response, 9 (36%) had partial response and the remaining patients had refractory/progressive disease with an overall response rate of 44%. Seven of the 10 patients who had relapsed/refractory disease after autologous SCT achieved a response (CR, 2; PR, 5). The median time to progression for responding patients was 3 months (range, 1-40 months). One patient is disease free for 40 months. Three patients were successfully bridged to SCT (autologous, 2; allogeneic, 1). Main toxicity was hematological. Grade \u2265 3 hematologic toxicity occurred in 10 patients: thrombocytopenia (36%), neutropenia (16%) and anemia (8%). Among these, 7 had previous autologous SCT. One patient had grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Treatment cycle postponed in 6 patients without dose reduction because of hematological toxicity. Seven patients (28%) needed G-CSF support. One patient developed febrile neutropenia. No treatment-related deaths occurred. GEMOX was shown to be an effective salvage regimen in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma, producing an overall response rate of 44%. It is an active regimen in patients who had relapsed/refractory disease after autologous SCT. Although, the median PFS time was short, some patients can be bridged to SCT and some can get long-term PFS. Hematological toxicity was common, especially in patients with previous autologous SCT.
