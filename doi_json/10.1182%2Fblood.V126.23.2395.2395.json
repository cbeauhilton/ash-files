    "abstract_text": "Bone marrow niche cells, specifically the Leptin-receptor-expressing perivascular stromal cells (LepR + ), CXCL12-abundant reticular cells (CAR), and endothelial cells play an important role in the maintenance and self-renewal functions of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). This maintenance function provided by the niche cells is mediated by a number of secretory-related molecules such as stem cell factor (SCF), CXCL12 and Angiopoietin. In addition, functional autophagy within HSCs is known to play a critical role for maintaining HSC homeostasis, as the loss of ATG7 in HSCs leads to loss of normal HSC functions and severe myeloproliferation. However, it remains unclear as to how hematopoiesis will be affected if autophagy is selectively blocked in bone marrow niche cells. To investigate the effect of autophagy deficiency within bone marrow niche cells on hematopoiesis, we generated a knockout mouse model allowing for a selective ablation of an autophagy-essential protein, ATG5, in LepR + perivascular stromal cells. We have confirmed that the deletion of Atg5 is indeed restricted to LepR + cells, and that the loss of ATG5 is sufficient to block autophagic function, as evident through the accumulation of p62 protein. We found that the white blood cell count (WBC) is significantly reduced in 16-week old male ATG5 KO mice compare to wild type (wt) littermate control mice (p<0.05). Further, the myeloid population (CD11b + Ly6G + ) in both bone marrow and peripheral blood is significantly decreased in ATG5 KO mice (p value < 0.05, ATG KO vs. wt control). WBC count continues to decline in 24-week old ATG5 KO male mice (p=0.02) but not in female mice (p=0.58). Both LSK (Lin - Sca-1 + c-Kit + ) and long term HSC (LT-HSCs, CD150 + CD48 - LSK) populations are decreased in both 16-week and 24-week old male mice; however, this trend did not reach statistical significance (p>0.05). Although the absolute cell count of lymphocytes, including B and T cells (CD19 + and CD3 + , respectively) in peripheral blood, is significantly dropped in ATG5 KO mice compared to wt controls, there is no significant change of mature B and T cells in bone marrow. These preliminary results suggest that deletion of a key autophagy regulator in LepR + bone marrow niche cells will cause leukopenia. The underlying mechanism is currently under investigation and it will help us to better understand the role of autophagy in hematopoiesis within the bone marrow microenvironment.
