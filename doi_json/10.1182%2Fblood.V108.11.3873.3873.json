    "abstract_text": "Thymic recent output function is characterized its importance of thymus to T-cell diversity in the periphery of both children and adults. The generation of TCR diversity occurs in the thymus through recombination of gene segments encoding the variable parts of the TCR \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains. During these processes, by-products of the rearrangements are generated in the form of signal joint T-cell receptor excision circles (sjTRECs), which is considered as a very valuable tool to estimate thymic function. Quantitative of \u03b4Rec-\u03c8J\u03b1 sjTRECs can direct evaluate the recent thymic output function, but it is unable to analyze the particular thymic output function of different TCR V\u03b2 subfamily naive T cells. The complexity of TCR V\u03b2 repertoire is an important factor for immune reconstitution, quantitative analysis of series TCR V\u03b2-D\u03b2 sjTRECs could be used to evaluate the levels of different V\u03b2 subfamily naive T cells. In the present study, quantitative analysis of \u03b4Rec-\u03c8J\u03b1 sjTRECs was performed in mononuclear cells, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+T cells from peripheral blood of normal individuals and cord blood by real-time PCR(TaqMan). And the analysis of 23 TCR V\u03b2-D\u03b21 sjTRECs was performed by semi-nested PCR. Different amounts of DNA (corresponding to 2*10 5 , 5*10 4 , 1*10 4 and 1*10 3 cells respectively) from all samples were amplified to estimate the frequency of TCR V\u03b2-D\u03b2 sjTRECs. The mean value of \u03b4Rec-\u03c8J\u03b1 sjTRECs was detected in 4.10\u00b13.65/1000 PBMCs, 6.37\u00b15.28/1000 CD3+cells, 3.28\u00b11.24/1000 CD4+cells, 4.67\u00b13.63/1000 CD8+cells from normal individuals (n=14) and 35.59\u00b147.56/1000 CBMC, 71.48\u00b186.42/1000 CD3+cells, 41.02\u00b132.9/1000 CD4+ cells, 52.05\u00b152.32/1000 CD8+cells from cord blood (n=9) (p=0.0208, p=0.0096, p=0.0003, p=0.0026, respectively). A part of V\u03b2 subfamily sjTRECs could be detected in all samples from cord blood (V\u03b22, 3, 4, 5, 10, 13, 14, 15, 19 and 22) and peripheral blood (V\u03b210, 13 and 14) at 5*10 4 cells level, some of V\u03b2 subfamily sjTRECs could be detected in 1*10 3 cells level. The frequencies of 23 V\u03b2-D\u03b21 sjTRECs were different at the same cellular concentration. The number of detectable V\u03b2 subfamily sjTRECs was 22.00\u00b10.94/2\u00d710 5 , 18.8\u00b11.87/5\u00d710 4 , 10.40\u00b12.99/1\u00d710 4 and 0.78\u00b11.39/1\u00d710 3 CBMCs, as compared with 18.70\u00b12.45/2\u00d710 5 (p=0.002), 13.7\u00b12.67/5\u00d710 4 (p<0.001), 5.5\u00b12.07/1\u00d710 4 (p=0.001) and 0.50\u00b10.71/1\u00d710 3 (p=0.739) in PBMCs from normal individuals. Similar results were found in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells which were sorted from both CBMCs and PBMCs, the number of detectable V\u03b2 subfamily sjTRECs was 13.90\u00b12.38/1\u00d710 4 CD4+cells, 11.5\u00b11.96/1\u00d710 4 CD8+cells from cord blood and 5.6\u00b12.68/1\u00d710 4 CD4+cells (p<0.001) and 8.2\u00b12.57/1\u00d710 4 CD8+cells (p>0.005) from normal individuals. The results indicate that the number of detectable sjTRECs of V\u03b2 subfamilies and the frequencies of most V\u03b2-D\u03b21 sjTRECs in normal PBMCs, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were obviously lower than those in cord blood. In conclusions, the results provide the base data of nai\u0308ve T cells levels and thymic recent output function in cord blood and peripheral blood of normail individuals in chinese."
