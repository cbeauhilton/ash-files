    "abstract_text": "BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations constitute the major mechanism of resistance in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with the ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib. Mutations causing resistance to therapeutic kinase inhibition were also identified in other target kinases in various malignant diseases, such as FLT3-ITD in acute myelogenous leukemia, cKit in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, EGFR in patients with lung cancer, and FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha in hypereosinophilic syndrome. Thus, mutations in kinase domains seem to be a general mechanism of resistance to therapeutically applicated tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We recently developed a cell-based screening strategy that allows one to predict the pattern and relative abundance of BCR-ABL resistance mutations emerging in the presence of imatinib, and the novel ABL kinase inhibitor AMN107 (nilotinib). We therefore intended to determine, if this method would also allow the generation of resistant cell clones with other oncogeneic tyrosine kinases as targets in the presence of specifically acting kinase inhibitors. When FLT3-ITD and su5614 were used as drug/target combination in our cell-based method, the frequency of resistant clones in the presence of su5614 at 10 times the IC50 was 0.17 per million cells. In 40 per cent of resistant clones, point mutations were detected leading to amino acid exchanges within the FLT3-ITD split kinase domain. The yield of resistant clones was increased by the factor of 14 to 2.37 per million cells by adding ethyl-nitrosourea (ENU), a potent inducer of point mutations. Also, the proportion of mutant clones increased from 40 to 74 per cent. In 83 mutant clones that were examined so far, we detected eight exchanges affecting kinase domain two (TK2) of the split kinase domain within or shortly behind the FLT3-ITD activation loop (A-loop). We did not detect exchanges affecting TK1. We next examined whether resistant clones would also come up with FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-transformed cells in the presence of imatinib. Again, the yield of resistant clones increased when cells were pretreated with ENU, and a proportion of resistant clones contained mutations in the FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha kinase domain, affecting the nucleotide-binding loop (P-loop) and A-loop. We conclude that cell-based resistance screening is a simple and powerful tool that allows prediction of resistance mutations towards kinase inhibitors in various relevant oncogeneic kinases.",
