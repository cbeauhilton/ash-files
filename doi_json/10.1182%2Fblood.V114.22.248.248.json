    "abstract_text": "Abstract 248 Radiation and chemotherapy cause myelosuppression in patients via damage to bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitor cells. It has been shown that BM HSCs reside in close association with osteoblasts and that BM osteoblasts regulate the maintenance of quiescent HSCs in vivo. HSCs also reside in proximity to BM sinusoidal vessels but the function of BM endothelial cells (BM ECs) in regulating HSC fate in vivo remains less well understood. We hypothesized that BM ECs play a critical role in regulating BM hematopoietic reconstitution following stress. In order to test this hypothesis, we utilized Cre-LoxP recombination to generate mice bearing targeted deletion of the pro-apoptotic genes, Bak and Bax, in Tie2+ BM ECs (Tie2Cre;Bak\u2212/\u2212 ;BaxFl/\u2212 mice) and measured their hematopoietic response to total body irradiation (TBI). Tie2Cre;Bak\u2212/\u2212;BaxFl/\u2212 mice (EC-Bak;Bax knockouts) were compared with Tie2Cre;Bak\u2212/\u2212;BaxFl/+ mice (EC-Bak;Bax (+) mice) which have constitutive Bak deletion but retain Bax in Tie2+ BM ECs. EC-Bak;Bax knockout mice had no detectable Bak or Bax by Western Blot in vascular tissues. After exposure to 100 cGy total body irradiation (TBI), EC-Bak;Bax knockout mice displayed a 2-fold increase in total viable BM cells (p=0.04), a 3-fold increase in BM ckit+sca+lineage- (KSL) progenitor cells, a 3-fold increase in colony-forming unit-spleen day 12 (CFU-S12) content (p=0.0003) and a 2-fold increase in 4 week competitive repopulating units (CRUs) compared to EC-Bak;Bax (+) mice. After 300 cGy TBI, comparable radioprotection was observed in the EC-Bak;Bax knockout mice, with a 1.9-fold increase in total BM cells, a 2.4-fold increase in CFU-S (p=0.01) and a 3.6-fold increase in 4 week CRU compared to EC-Bak;Bax (+) mice. Taken together, these results suggested that targeted protection of Tie2+ BM ECs from the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis mediated protection of BM hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells following TBI. Since Tie2 is expressed by BM ECs and a small subset of quiescent BM HSCs, we carried out experiments to determine whether the radioprotection we observed in EC-Bak;Bax knockout mice was caused autonomously by protection of Tie2+ BM ECs or Tie2+ HSCs. We transplanted 4 \u00d7 106 BM cells from EC-Bak;Bax knockout mice into lethally irradiated (950 cGy) wild type (WT) B6.SJL mice such that, after 12 weeks post-transplant, the recipient mice were chimeric for Bak and Bax deletions only in hematopoietic cells while retaining a wild type BM microenvironment (HSC-Bak;Bax knockout;EC-wild type), verified by qRTPCR. At 16 weeks post-transplant, the chimeric recipient mice were then exposed to 100 and 300 cGy TBI and we compared the hematopoietic response of these mice to that of EC-Bak;Bax knockout mice. Interestingly, after 100 cGy TBI, the hematopoietic response of the chimeric mice was comparable to that of wild type C57Bl6 mice and revealed a significant reduction in total viable BM cells (1.3-fold), BM KSL cells (7.4 fold) and BM CRU-4 weeks (9-fold) compared to 100 cGy-irradiated EC-Bak;Bax knockout mice. Significant reductions in total BM cells and BM CRU content were also observed in chimeric mice compared to EC-Bak;Bax knockout mice following 300 cGy TBI. These results suggest that deletion of Bak and Bax-mediated apoptosis in Tie2+ BM ECs protects BM hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from ionizing radiation damage and this protection is largely autonomous to Tie2+ BM ECs. More generally, these data demonstrate that protection of BM ECs from the deleterious effects of ionizing radiation results in augmented hematopoietic reconstitution following TBI. This study demonstrates that Tie2+ BM ECs have an essential role in regulating hematopoietic regeneration following injury and reveals that BM ECs are a novel and attractive therapeutic target to augment hematopoietic reconstitution in vivo.
