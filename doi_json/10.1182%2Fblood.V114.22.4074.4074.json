    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4074 Poster Board III-1009 Strategies to induce fetal hemoglobin (HbF) synthesis for the treatment of \u03b2-hemoglobinopathies will likely involve chromatin modification in the presence of histone deacetylase (HDAC)/protein complexes to promote \u03b3-globin gene activation. The role of various HDACs in globin transcription is not very well understood therefore, the objective of our study was to identify HDACs involved in \u03b3-gene regulation. Screening studies were performed in K562 erythroleukemia cells to determine transcription levels for HDAC genes in the absence or presence of HbF induction. Treatment with butyrate (2mM), trichostatin A (0.5\u03bcM) and the non-HDAC inhibitor control hemin (50\u03bcM) significantly reduced mRNA levels of HDAC9 and its splice variant HDRP (histone deacetylase related protein) lending indirect evidence for their involvement in drug-mediated \u03b3-globin regulation. Subsequent studies were performed to delineate whether HDAC9 can directly modulate \u03b3-globin gene transcription since a role for HDAC9 in hematopoiesis has been previously demonstrated. Furthermore, consensus binding sites for GATA-1 are present in the HDAC9 gene proximal promoter. Initially, we performed siRNA knockdown using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) in K562 cells and measured \u03b3-globin levels by real time quantitative PCR analysis. Treatment with siHDAC9 (Dharmacon) produced dose-dependent \u03b3-globin gene silencing over an 80-320nM range; control siRNA molecules had no effect. When HDAC9 was over-expressed in K562 cells using pTarT-HDAC9 at 10-50\u03bcg concentrations, a dose dependent 2.5-fold increase in \u03b3-globin mRNA (p50%. Collectively these data support a positive role for HDAC9 in \u03b3-globin regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays will be completed to elucidate the contribution of HDAC9 in maintaining an active chromatin domain in the \u03b3-globin promoter. We will also define interactions of GATA-1 in the HDAC9 gene to coordinate expression during erythroid maturation. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
