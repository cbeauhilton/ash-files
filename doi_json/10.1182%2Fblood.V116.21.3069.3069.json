    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3069 Background: Monosomal karyotype (MK) is defined as the presence of two or more distinct autosomal chromosome monosomies or a single autosomal monosomy associated with at least one structural abnormality (Breems DA et al. J Clin Oncol 2008; 26: 4791). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), MK has been shown to be prognostically worse than complex or other unfavorable karyotype (Breems DA et al. J Clin Oncol 2008; 26: 4791). In primary myelofibrosis (PMF), complex karyotype or isolated trisomy 8 predicts inferior survival ( Hussein K et al. Blood 2010; 115: 496) . Objective: To determine if MK in PMF is prognostically distinct from previously defined poor cytogenetic risk categories including complex karyotype and isolated trisomy 8. Methods: The Mayo Clinic database for PMF was used to identify consecutive patients with unfavorable karyotype including complex karyotype and sole trisomy 8. WHO criteria were used for PMF diagnosis and leukemic transformation (Vardiman JW et al. Blood 2009; 114: 937). Results: Among 793 PMF patients with cytogenetic information at the time of their first time referral to the Mayo Clinic, 452 displayed a normal karyotype and 341 (43%) an abnormal karyotype. Of the latter, 41 (12%) displayed complex karyotype and 21 (6%) sole trisomy 8. Among the 41 patients with complex karyotype, 17 (42%) met the criteria for MK and 24 (58%) displayed complex karyotype without monosomies. Overall survival was significantly inferior in patients with MK compared to those with either complex karyotype without monosomies (p=0.02; HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1\u20134.8) or trisomy 8 (p=0.02; HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2\u20135.1) ( Fig. 1 ). Prognosis among all three groups was significantly worse than patients with normal karyotype ( Fig. 1 ). Leukemia-free survival was also significantly inferior in patients with MK compared to those with either complex karyotype without monosomies (p=0.02; HR 6.9, 95% CI 1.3\u201337.3) or trisomy 8 (p=0.02; HR 14.8, 95% CI 1.7\u2013130.8) ( Fig. 2 ). LFS in patients with normal karyotype was similar to those with either complex karyotype without monosomies (p=0.31) or trisomy 8 (p=0.86) ( Figure 2 ). Conclusions: Monosomal karyotype in PMF is distinctly associated with extremely poor overall and leukemia-free survivals that are significantly worse than those seen in PMF patients with other unfavorable karyotype including complex karyotype without monosomies and sole trisomy 8 abnormalities.
