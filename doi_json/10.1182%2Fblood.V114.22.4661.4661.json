    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4661 Introduction Invasive or possible fungal infection is often fatal and its incidence is increasing in febrile neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies. Thus, empirical antifungal agent should be carefully selected for those patients. Patients and Methods The study was conducted as a prospective multicenter trial to document the efficacy and safety of micafungin (Mycamine\u00ae), a class of echinocandin, as an empirical antifungal agent in febrile neutropenic patients. Micafungin was administrated for sustained fever (>38.4\u00b0C) on day 3 - 5 after initiation of empirical antibiotic therapy. The overall success rate according to the composite score (no breakthrough fungal infection, survival for seven days beyond the end of therapy, did not discontinue therapy prematurely, had resolution of fever during the period of neutropenia, and successfully treated a documented base-line fungal infection) and side effects were evaluated. Results A total of 47 patients with AML, ALL, MDS or lymphomas were enrolled. The overall success rate was 61.7% (29/47). Three patients (6.4 %) experienced grade 3/4 elevated aspartate aminotransferase and ten patients (21 %) showed grade 3/4 hyperbilirubinemia and nine of which resolved, and four patients died of septic shock. Patients with young age (< 50 yr) and ALL rather than AML showed a better response to micafungin. Less profoundly neutropenic (\u226550 /mm3) patients revealed a better response, as did the patients who recovered from fever or neutropenia. Conclusions Micafungin has been reported to have an excellent efficacy (61.7 %) and safety profile when used as an empirical antifungal agent to treat febrile neutropenic patients with hematological disorders.
