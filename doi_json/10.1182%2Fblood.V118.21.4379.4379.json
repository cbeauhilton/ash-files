    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4379 Objective To investigate the somatic mutations of PIG-A gene and the expressions of EGR-1 and WT1 genes in the bone marrow cells of the patients with Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, then explore the characteristics of PIG-A gene mutation in Chinese patients with PNH and the possible mechanism of PNH clonal expansion related to EGR-1 and WT1 genes. Methods The quantities of CD55 \u2212 cells and CD59 \u2212 cells in both peripheral blood and bone marrow were examined with flow cytometric assay(FCM), and then sorting CD59 \u2212 cells from bone marrow mononuclears (BMMNCs). The mutant segments of PIG-A gene were identified by DNA sequencing; The expressions of EGR-1 and WT1 mRNA in CD59 \u2212 and CD59 + BMMNC were measured with semiquantitive RT-PCR. Results Nine in sixteen patients with PNH and one in four patients with AA-PNH were measured for their PIG-A gene mutation. Five single base substitution were found, including A\u2192G, G\u2192T, A\u2192T, T\u2192G and G\u2192C, resulting in one consense and seven missense mutations. Each of 3 PNH patients had more than two point mutations of PIG-A gene. Insert or deletion mutation of PIG-A gene were not found. The relative mRNA expressions of EGR-1and WT1 genes in CD59 \u2212 BMMNC, CD59 + BMMNC of PNH or AA-PNH patient and BMMNC of normal controls were (1.00\u00b10.11), (0.86\u00b10.14), (0.85\u00b10.06) and (1.06\u00b10.16), (0.90\u00b10.14), (0.88\u00b10.06), the expression in CD59 \u2212 BMMNC was significantly higher than that in CD59 + BMMNC or normal controls (p<0.05). There was no significant difference between the expression in CD59 + BMMNC and normal controls(p>0.05). The relative mRNA expressions of EGR-1 and WT1 in BMMNC of PNH and AA-PNH cases were positively correlated with the proportion of CD59 \u2212 cells(coefficient correlation was 0.509 and 0.481 respectively, p<0.05), but not related to the proportion of CD59 + cells. Conclusions The PIG-A gene mutation in some Chinese patients mainly manifested as single base substitution, occurred at random sites and without hot spot, the overexpression of EGR-1 and WT1 genes in PNH clone could promote the abnormal clone expansion.
