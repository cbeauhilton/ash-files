    "abstract_text": "Resveratrol is present naturally in a variety of fruits and medicinal plants. It imparts protective benefits to plants against pathogenic attack and environmental stress. In human, it was noted to be able to protect against cardiovascular disease and inhibit platelet aggregation. Its anti-oxidant activities were also suggestive in human cancer chemoprevention and chemotherapy. In this in-vitro study we investigated the anti-proliferative effect of resveratrol on human normal hematopoietic progenitor cells and leukemic cells. Resveratrol of 1 mM to 0.1 \u03bcM at 10-fold dilutions were applied to hematopoietic progenitor cultures. Duplicates of 5 x 10 4 mononuclear cells (n=7) and 5 x 10 3 CD34 + cells (n=3) derived from 10 umbilical cord blood (UCB) samples were cultured for two weeks in methylcellulose enriched with 100 ng/mL granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, 20 ng/mL stem cell factor, 2 IU/mL erythropoietin and various concentration of resveratrol. There was no growth of colony-forming unit (CFU) in cultures supplemented with high-dose resveratrol (10 UCB: 100% in 1 mM, 90% in 100 \u03bcM and 10% in 10 \u03bcM), exhibiting an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in a dose-dependent manner. The numbers of CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM and BFU derived from cultures with 10 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM and 0.1 \u03bcM resveratrol demonstrated no significant difference as compared to that of control cultures without resveratrol. Ten \u03bcM resveratrol were added to 12 human leukemic cell lines (AML: KG-1a, Kasumi-1, HL60, NB4, Meg-01, CHRF 288-11; CML: K562; B-lineage ALL: 697, RS-411, REH; T-lineage ALL: Molt-3, CCRF-CEM) at 5 x 10 5 /mL and cultured for four days in triplicate. Cell counts, trypan blue dye exclusion tests and flow cytometry were conducted daily on cultures to evaluate growth, viability and cell cycle phase distribution, respectively. There was a significant and progressive decrease in the numbers of viable cells in resveratrol-supplemented cultures (median [range]: 26.1% [14.3% \u2013 50.3%] at 24 hours, 43.1% [18.2% \u2013 54.6%] at 48 hours, 45.6% [9.3% \u2013 67.6%] at 72 hours and 32.5% [15.7% \u2013 55.3%] at 96 hours). Cell cycle analysis revealed a remarkably elevated proportion of apoptotic cells at pre-G 1 phase in resveratrol-supplemented cultures on day one (with vs. without: 15.9% [2.0% \u2013 41.2%] vs. 7.8% [2.4% \u2013 17.6%]; p =0.011). Besides, a growth arrest of CHRF 288-11 (51.6% vs. 39.8%; p =0.032) and Molt-3 (70.2% vs. 54.2%; p =0.002) was noted in G 1 phase, whereas an accumulation of KG-1a (25.8% vs. 19.6%; p =0.019) and CCRF-CEM (26.2% vs. 23.2%; p =0.026) in S phase was observed. Data of this study suggest that 10 \u03bcM resveratrol may exert an anti-proliferative effect against human leukemic cells but pose no apparent suppression to normal hematopoiesis.",
