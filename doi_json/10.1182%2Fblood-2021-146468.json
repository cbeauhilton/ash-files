    "abstract_text": "Background TP53 mutations are associated with adverse outcome of AML treated with cytarabine-based regimens. Interestingly, DNA-hypomethylating agents (HMAs) induce a higher response rate in TP53 -mutated (MUT) compared to TP53 wildtype (WT) AML (Welch et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 2016, D\u00f6hner et al., Leukemia 2018). We conducted a randomized phase II trial (NCT00867672, 2x2 factorial design) asking whether the in vitro cooperativity of DAC with VPA or ATRA translates into clinical benefit. While VPA added to DAC affected neither objective response rate (ORR) nor overall survival (OS), ATRA significantly improved ORR and OS, without added toxicity (L\u00fcbbert et al., J. Clin. Oncol. 2020). Preclinical data suggest that HMAs and ATRA have cooperative effects also in TP53 MUT AML. We therefore performed a post-hoc analysis to determine the predictive impact of TP53 status. Patients and Methods Key inclusion criteria: newly diagnosed AML pts >60 yr (non-M3) unfit for induction, ECOG performance status (PS) 0-2. Treatment: DAC 20 mg/m 2 day 1-5 (arms A/B/C/D), VPA p.o. from day 6 (arms B/D), ATRA p.o. day 6-28 (arms C/D) of each 28-day course. For TP53 mutation analyses, the Illumina TruSight Myeloid Sequencing Panel was used for library preparation and an Illumina MiSeq device for sequencing. Key endpoints: ORR (CR/CRi/PR, ELN 2010 criteria) and OS. Original sample size calculation of a total of 200 patients (pts) was based on the primary endpoint ORR (L\u00fcbbert et al., Haematologica 2012). ORR was analyzed with logistic regression, OS with Cox regression. Odds ratios (OR) for the effect on ORR and hazard ratios (HR) for the effect on death with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are presented in the genetic subgroups TP53 MUT and TP53 WT including tests for interactions (TFI) between treatment and TP53 . These are post-hoc exploratory analyses, hence p-values have to be interpreted in a descriptive sense. Results Between 12/2011 and 2/2015, 200 pts were randomized and treated. Information on TP53 status was available for 168 of 200 pts (84%); 155 of them (92%) had died at last follow-up (June 2021). 61% of pts were aged >75 years (range 61-92), ECOG PS 0/1/2: 19/62/19% (a single pt had a PS of 3); 53% had an HCT-CI >3, 19% WBC >30.000/\u00b5l, 30% adverse genetics (ELN 2010), 51% an antecedent hematologic disorder. TP53 aberrations were detected in 42 pts (25%), with 1 (n=27) or 2 mutations (n=12, median variant allele frequency 44%, range, 1.3-99%) in 39 pts, and TP53 deletions in 3 additional pts. The 42 pts with TP53 MUT showed a higher ORR (23.8%) than the 126 pts with TP53 WT (ORR 15.1%), with an OR of 2.04 (95% CI 0.83-4.98), p=0.12. OS (irrespective of treatment) in the TP53 MUT v WT pts was not different (HR, adjusted for treatment: 1.14 [95% CI 0.78-1.66], p=0.51; Fig. A). In both genetic groups, the addition of ATRA had a favorable effect on ORR (ATRA v no ATRA in TP53 MUT: 31.3% v 19.2%, OR 1.91 [95% CI 0.45-8.03]; ATRA v no ATRA in TP53 WT: 18.8% v 10.5%, OR 1.98 [95% CI 0.70-5.61]), TFI p=0.97 (Fig. B). A positive effect of ATRA on OS in both genetic groups was reflected by a median OS of 6.0 v 4.5 months (ATRA v no ATRA in TP53 MUT: HR 0.75 [95% CI 0.38-1.48]), and a median OS of 8.9 v 4.7 months (ATRA v no ATRA in TP53 WT: HR 0.58 [95% CI 0.39-0.86], all results adjusted for VPA, ECOG, HCT-CI, sLDH, Hb), TFI p=0.49 (Fig. C). VPA did not affect ORR in either of the 2 genetic groups (VPA v no VPA in TP53 MUT: 21.7% v 26.3%, OR 0.76 [95% CI 0.18-3.21]; VPA v no VPA in TP53 WT: 16.7% v 13.3%, OR 1.34 [95% CI 0.5-3.61]), TFI p=0.53. The impact of VPA on OS differed between TP53 MUT pts (VPA v no VPA: median OS of 4.2 v 5.3 months, HR 1.31 [95% CI 0.69-2.48], and TP53 WT pts (VPA v no VPA: median OS of 8.4 v 4.8 months, HR 0.67 [95% CI 0.46-0.99], all results adjusted for ATRA, ECOG, HCT-CI, sLDH, Hb; TFI p=0.08, Fig. C). Conclusions Our results confirm the reported higher response rate to DAC in pts with TP53 MUT compared to TP53 WT; the addition of ATRA led to a higher ORR. Improved OS with ATRA was observed particularly in TP53 WT pts. In contrast, VPA did not affect the ORR in either genetic group; TP53 WT pts may benefit from VPA regarding OS. Our exploratory post-hoc results need confirmation in other trials, e.g. in the DECIDER-2 study (adding ATRA or placebo to the recently approved dual treatment of a HMA combined with venetoclax). Cooperative effects of HMAs and retinoids deserve a deeper mechanistic understanding, which may have implications not only for AML but also for other malignancies with impaired TP53 .
