    "abstract_text": "Hematological malignancies comprise a genetically heterogeneous spectrum of diseases caused by abnormal proliferation or maturation of a variety of hematological cell lineages. Genomic abnormalities including chromosomal translocations, copy number variations and sequence level gene mutations underlie the pathogenesis of these disorders and frequently serve as important diagnostic, prognostic and/or therapeutic markers. However, the substantial discrepancy in interpretation and reporting of these genomic abnormalities among testing labs creates challenges for patient management. Therefore, standardizing the curation, clinical interpretation and reporting of somatic alterations within the context of their diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic significance in hematological cancers is critical. In January 2020, the ClinGen Somatic Cancer Clinical Domain working group formed the Hematological Cancer Taskforce (HCT) with a goal to undertake systematic curation and evidence-based clinical interpretation of genes/somatic variants associated with hematological malignancies. The HCT has recruited 32 multi-disciplinary experts including oncologists, molecular pathologists, clinical lab directors, genomic scientists and biocurators with expertise in hematological malignancies. In collaboration with the Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIViC) (civicdb.org) knowledgebase, variants from peer-reviewed publications are curated with editor review for clinical utility as evidence items. Monthly discussions based on these evidence items lead to the creation of summary variant assertions using the AMP/ASCO/CAP guidelines (Li M, et al., Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, 2017). The HCT is currently focused on expert curation and clinical interpretation of somatic variants in FLT3 (internal tandem duplication, tyrosine kinase domain and non tyrosine kinase domain variants) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Expert curation of gene fusions in Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) in collaboration with the ClinGen somatic pediatric cancer taskforce is currently underway. To date, the HCT has curated 45 evidence items from clinical and pre-clinical studies on the aforementioned genes/variants. In addition, three AMP Tier I, level A variant assertions of FLT3 -ITD, D835 and I836, which predict response to Gilteritinib, an FDA-approved drug for relapsed or refractory AML, have been curated. In the future, the HCT plans to extend its focus on curation of BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Based on the initial pilot curation phase, the HCT will develop gene-specific recommendations to standardize the reporting and interpretation of somatic variants to better assist clinical decisions and apply to become official ClinGen Somatic Expert Panels in each of these gene-disease domains.
