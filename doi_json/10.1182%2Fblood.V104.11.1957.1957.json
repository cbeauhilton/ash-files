    "abstract_text": "The overall unfavorable prognosis of CD10 negative (CD10 \u2212 ) precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) is well known. We analyzed 4473 pediatric patients (pts) <18 years (y) with BCP-ALL and immunophenotyping of CD10 enrolled from 1986 to 2000 in three consecutive ALL-BFM trials to explore prognostic factors in the CD10 \u2212 subset. CD10 negativity was defined by CD10 expression in <20% of blasts. 233 pts (5.2%) were CD10 \u2212 . In comparison to CD10 positive (CD10 + ) BCP-ALL pts, CD10 \u2212 pts comprised more infants (age <1y 34% vs. 1%, p(X 2 )<0.001), more cases with hyperleukocytosis (WBC \u2265100/nl 43% vs. 6%, p<0.001), more CNS involvement (CNS positive 10% vs. 2%; p<0.001) and an impaired treatment response (prednisone poor response (PPR) 22% vs. 5%, p<0.001; induction failure 6% vs. 1%, p<0.001). Estimated probability of 5 years event free survival (5y-pEFS) was significantly lower in pts with CD10 \u2212 as compared to CD10 + BCP-ALL (49\u00b13% vs 81\u00b10.6%, p(log-rank)<0.001). Cox regression analysis including age, WBC, prednisone response (PR) and MLL/AF4 status as covariables revealed CD10 negativity as independent prognostic factor (RR 1.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1\u20132.1, p=0.01). Further analyses were performed within the CD10 \u2212 group: 83% of infants and 60% of pts \u22651y were successfully analyzed for MLL/AF4. MLL/AF4 was detected in 55% of pts <1y and 27% of pts \u22651y. The well known risk factors for BCP-ALL (sex, age, WBC, CNS involvement, MLL/AF4 and PPR) also had prognostic impact within the CD10 \u2212 group:  . . n* . 5y-pEFS* (%) .

Significant correlation with PR could only be demonstrated for expression of CD24, which is presumed to act as negative regulator in B-cell development through mediation of apoptosis.  . age<1y* .

The identification of additional prognosis associated immunophenotypic markers may contribute to further refinement of treatment strategies for CD10 \u2212 BCP-ALL pts.",
