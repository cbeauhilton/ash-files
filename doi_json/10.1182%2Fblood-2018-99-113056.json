    "abstract_text": "Around 20% of pediatric and the majority of adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) suffer relapse, and prognosis after relapse is very poor. Therefore, identifying those at risk for treatment failure and improving their outcome is imperative. In B-ALL, deletions and mutations of the gene IKAROS family zinc finger 1 ( IKZF1 ) are associated with an increased risk of relapse. IKZF1 encodes the IKAROS protein, which is a master lymphoid regulatory transcription factor and chromatin remodeler. Somatic IKZF1 lesions are thought to be secondarily acquired, arising in lymphoblasts with existing driver genetic lesions, most commonly co-occurring with BCR-ABL1 fusion, activating kinase fusions of Ph-like disease and deregulated DUX4 and ERG . In B-ALL, mono- or bi-allelic deletions of the entire gene, as well as intragenic deletions occur. One of the most common perturbations of IKZF1 in B-ALL is an intragenic deletion of a 50-kilobase (kb) region containing exons 4-7, resulting in the expression of a dominant-negative isoform, IK6. Recently published clinical data show potentially conflicting results over the benefits of therapy intensification in IKZF1 -mutant cases (Clappier et al., 2015; Hinze et al., 2017; & Yeoh, et al., 2018). Human cell models of these deletions are needed, as there may be unknown functional differences among mutation types, and the available body of data relies on clinical statistical associations, in vitro RNA interference, viral overexpression of IK6, and mouse models. We used the CRISPR/Cas9 system in the human B-ALL cell lines Nalm-6 and REH by electroporation with sgRNA-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) to generate IKZF1- mutant clones. We identified single cell-derived clonal lines with IKZF1 frameshift mutations in one or both alleles by Sanger sequencing and TIDE decomposition. We confirmed ablation of protein expression by immunoblotting. We treated the IKZF1-mutant clonal cell lines with chemotherapeutic agents commonly used to treat B-ALL and calculated the IC 50 by Annexin V/7-AAD double-negative population after 48-72 hour treatment. Compared to IKZF1 -wild type Nalm-6 cells, Nalm-6 IKZF1 -/- clones exhibited profound resistance to dexamethasone and modest but significant resistance to most other chemotherapeutics tested including vincristine, asparaginase, and daunorubicin. In contrast, these cell lines were more sensitive to the nucleoside analog, cytarabine (Panel A). We next analyzed gene expression profiles by RNA-seq and observed that IKZF1 -/- clones are characterized by a stem cell-like gene expression signature and activation of the JAK/STAT pathway (Panel B). Transplantation into immunodeficient NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice demonstrated that IKZF1 deletion leads to enhanced engraftment, significantly increased bone marrow homing, and reduced survival time (Panel D). We also employed a novel CRISPR/Cas9 homology-directed repair (HDR) strategy to generate clonal cell lines expressing IK6 under control of the endogenous promoter, which represents a significant advantage to many previous studies utilizing viral overexpression. We electroporated the cells with sgRNA-Cas9 RNPs along with a 3kb commercially synthesized double-stranded DNA HDR template that knocks-in exon 8 with a GFP tag directly following exon 3. Using this strategy, we were able to isolate heterozygous clones ( IKZF1 IK6/+ ) from both Nalm-6 (Panel C) and REH cell lines using flow cytometry sorting for GFP-positive cells. We confirmed precise HDR by Sanger sequencing and immunoblotting. When transplanted into immunodeficient mice, IKZF1 IK6/+ cells showed delayed engraftment and disease onset, but profound splenic infiltration, consistent with a more indolent, infiltrative disease phenotype (Panels D & E). Ongoing drug treatment assays suggest the chemosensitivity profiles of IKZF1 IK6/+ and IKZF1 IK6/- clonal cell lines are distinct from their isogenic IKZF1 -/- counterparts. Our data support clinical studies reporting that IKZF1- mutated B-ALL is an aggressive, infiltrative, and treatment-resistant disease. Notable differences in drug response and in vivo dynamics in xenografts exist between IKZF1 -/- cells and IKZF1 IK6/+ cells. Detailed delineation of the exact IKZF1 status in ALL patients at diagnosis may be informative in more accurately determining risk stratification and the most effective therapeutic regimen.
