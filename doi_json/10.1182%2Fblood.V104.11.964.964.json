    "abstract_text": "Serum BLyS levels have been found to be elevated in a number of immune disease models and there is increasing evidence that this may correlate with pathogenesis of various B cell related disorders including B cell malignancies. While it is clear that BLyS expression is required for normal B cell development and homeostasis, the exact source of BLyS in these scenarios and definition of the mechanisms that control BLyS expression remain to be fully elucidated. Serum BLyS levels are elevated in a number of B cell malignancies known to have a familial incidence. Therefore, we sought to determine if there was any correlation between serum BLyS levels and family history of B cell cancers. In our initial studies we examined the serum BLyS levels in patients with sporadic vs. familial B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL; near relative with B-CLL, multiple myeloma, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma), and normal age-matched controls. In the normal controls (n=50), the mean serum BLyS level was 12.7 ng/ml, and we found that 4/50 (8%) had BLyS levels exceeding 20 ng/ml. In the sporadic CLL cohort (n=52), the mean serum BLyS level was 18.3 ng/ml, and we found that 5/52 (10%) had BLyS levels exceeding 20 ng/ml. In striking contrast, in the familial CLL cohort (n=24), the mean serum BLyS levels was 33.4 ng/ml, and we found that 11/24 (46%) had BLyS levels exceeding 20 ng/ml. The percentage of patients with elevated BLyS levels, as well as the mean BLyS levels in the familial CLL cohort compared to the normal controls, was significantly higher (mean, p=0.002) and suggests that elevated BLyS levels may correlate with familial CLL. Because of the correlation between BLyS levels and family history B cell malignancies, we next wanted to determine if there was a common underlying genetic event influencing BLyS expression in this group of patients. We began by sequencing the BLyS promoter in 19 patients with B-CLL and 11 normal controls. We identified 2 sites that were polymorphic, \u2212661 A/G and \u2212871 C/T. The \u2212871 T/T genotype has been previously reported to be expressed at increased frequency in SLE patients and is associated with elevated BLyS mRNA levels. Using RFLP analysis we examined the presence of the two polymorphisms in our control, sporadic, and familial CLL cohorts. In the control group (n=50) we found that at \u2212871, C/C (wildtype) was expressed in 24%, C/T in 54%, and T/T in 22% of patients. Similarily, in the sporadic CLL group (n=35) we found that at \u2212871, C/C was expressed in 29%, C/T in 57%, and T/T in 14%. In the familial group (n=24) we found that at \u2212871, C/C was expressed in only 8%, C/T in 67%, and T/T in 25%. These data suggest a decreased representation of \u2212871 C/C in the familial group. No significant changes were observed between the three groups at the \u2212661 A/G locus. Additionally, we found that none of the patients with BLyS levels exceeding 20 ng/ml expresses C/C at \u2212871. In summary, our data suggest that BLyS levels are elevated in patients with familial CLL relative to both normal controls and individuals with sporadic CLL and that elevated BLyS levels may correlate with the presence of a T at \u2212871 in the BLyS promoter."
