    "abstract_text": "2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA, Cladribine) was used in patients with advanced, low-grade lymphomas (Lymphoplasmacytoid, Centroblastic/centrocytic, Centrocytic, Lymphocytic) resistant to conventional therapy. There was conducted a trial of 2-CdA group versus control group (patients treated different chemotherapy: Chlorambucil, COP, CHOP) in 85 patients. There were 47 men and 38 women with median age of 55 years were treated. Forty five patients with low-grade lymphomas were given 2-CdA at 0.1 mg/kg/d as a 7\u20135 day continuous infusion every 4\u20136 weeks. A total number of courses was different (2\u20137), median of three courses per patient, of 2-CdA were administered. All patients were evaluable for toxicity and for response. The results of overall response for 2-CdA group and control group are in table 1. Table 1- The results of overall response for 2-CdA group and control group  . 2-CdA Group . Control Group . P .

The median response duration was 12 months (range, 3 to 44+). I observed less death numbers in 2-CdA first line patients than II\u2013III line 2-CdA group (P=.00132). Conclusions : There was no statistical significant difference in frequency overall response (CR+PR) between 2-CdA group and chemotherapy treated group. 2-CdA therapy as a consecutive line caused an increase in mortality risk in contrast to the first line therapy. 2-CdA therapy as II\u2013III line therapy allowed to receive complete remission in 9.4% previously treated low grade non Hodkin\u2019s lymphoma patients."
