    "abstract_text": "Objective: To study the effect of nonmyeloablative peripheral blood stem cell transplantation(PBSCT) for chronic myelogenous leukemia(CML) in chronic phase(CML-CP) and advanced phase(CML-AP). Methods: Twenty-four CML patients, 16 in CML-CP and 4 in CML-AP underwent nonmyeloablative peripheral blood stem cell transplantation(NST). The conditioning regimen included fludarabine 30mg.m \u22122 .d \u22121 , intravenously(i.v.)\u00d76d, busulphan 4mg.m \u22122 .d \u22121 \u00d72d and CTX 350mg.m \u22122 .d \u22121 \u00d72d combined with or without Ara-C. The donors were HLA-identical (n=20) and 5/6 antigen-matched (n=4). Results: All the patients were successfully engrafted. The mean time needed for increase of the number of neutrophils to more than 0.5\u00d710 9 /L and platelet more than 20\u00d710 9 /L were 13 days and 11.5 days respectively. Among 12 patients, 9 showed complete donor chimerism(CDC) and 3 showed mixed chimerism(MC) at +day 30. At +day 180, 18 patients still alive showed CDC and remained alive after a median follow-up of 24 months (4\u223c48months). 3 cases died of severe acute GVHD(aGVHD), 1 case of chronic GVHD(cGVHD), 2 cases of interstitial pneumonia(IP) and 1 case of relapse. Conclusion: Nonmyeloablative PBSCT is an effective method for CML patients in chronic phase and advanced phase. Characteristics of 24 CML patients and their donors  Patient . Age . Gender .
