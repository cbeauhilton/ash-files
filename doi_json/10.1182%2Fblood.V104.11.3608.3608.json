Clinical observations suggest that organ dysfunction (heart, liver, endocrine dysfunction, bone disease) resulting from iron overload is seen more often in patients with THL than SCD. This study examines the possible correlation between increased organ injury in these patients and oxidative stress, iron metabolism, inflammation and plasma vitamin E. Methods: Markers of oxidant stress were compared in 18 subjects with THL (7M, 24 \u00b1 9 yrs) and 11 with SCD (7M, 13 \u00b1 4 yrs) with 10 disease-free controls (5M, 27 \u00b1 12 yrs). All THL and SCD patients admitted to the study were healthy and had not had a recent medical event including vascular crises for SCD within the last 4 months. Blood was drawn from fasted subjects, prior to blood transfusion, and plasma, serum and cells were separated by centrifugation. Plasma levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of lipid peroxidation, were determined by GC-MS. Non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI), protein carbonyls and tocopherol content were measured by HPLC. C Reactive Protein (CRP) was determined by ELISA. Liver iron content was analyzed by ICP-mass spectrometry from disease patients. Results: Table 1 Values are means \u00b1 SD (subject n). Within a row, underlined values are significantly different from control and starred values are significantly different between THL and SCD (P<0.05).  Parameter . Control . THL . SCD .

In contrast, evidence for inflammation such as ferritin and CRP were significantly higher in SCD. g-tocopherol was significantly higher in SCD relative to THL. Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that THL patients have higher levels of toxic free iron and more evidence for tissue injury than SCD. SCD patients may be protected, in part, by greater inflammation and unique antioxidant reserves. The prospective Multicenter Study of Iron Overload in SCD and THL will determine whether these biomarkers are predictors of differences in end organ failure in these two diseases.",
