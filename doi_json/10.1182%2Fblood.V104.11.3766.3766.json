    "abstract_text": "Background: Iron overload is the main cause of morbidity and mortality especially from heart failure in patients with beta thalassemia major [TM]. Successful iron chelation is thus essential for the optimal management of TM. Although desferrioxamine [DFX] has been the major iron-chelating treatment of transfusional iron overload, compliance is a major hindrance. The availability of oral iron chelation with deferiprone [L 1 ] since 1987 was welcome but showed poor efficacy when used alone as compared to DFX. Aim: To compare DFX and prospective combined therapy with DFX and L 1 in beta thalassemia major patients with iron overload. Methods: We studied 69 patients with beta thalassemia major (Mean age \u00b1 SD, 15.02\u00b1 5.8; Range 4\u201328 years) attending the Day Care unit for regular transfusional support. They received packed red cells every 3\u20134 weeks to maintain pre-transfusion hemoglobin concentration above 9 g/dl. They were receiving DFX at a daily dose of 40mg/kg/day by subcutaneous infusion for 8\u201310 hrs on 4\u20135 nights each week for past several years. However, owing to various reasons, they developed considerable transfusional iron overload. These patients were enrolled prospectively to receive additional therapy with oral iron chelator L 1 at 75 mg/kg body weight in three divided doses with food after informed consent and also continued to receive treatment with DFX as per the above dosage. Results: Of the 69 patients, 6 developed severe GI upset, 2 developed persistently raised liver enzymes, 2 died [sepsis], two underwent bone marrow transplantation and 2 developed agranulocytosis and so did not continue in the study. In the remaining 55 evaluable patients, [3\u201348 months on combination therapy; mean(\u00b1SD) 22\u00b112 months] the mean serum ferritin(\u00b1SD) fell dramatically from 3088(\u00b11299) [DFX alone] to 2051(\u00b1935)ng/ml [DFX+L1; p<0.001], with the mean of lowest serum ferritin being 1731(\u00b1828) ng/ml in this group. Interestingly, there was also a significant improvement in the Ejection fraction [p<0.004]and Fractional shortening[p<0.0436] in these patients.

The results also demonstrate significant statistical improvement as early as 6 months of combination therapy. Furthermore, this improvement was sustained leading to a progressive fall in the mean serum ferritin. Lastly, the study also demonstrates significant improvement in echocardiographic parameters of myocardial performance in these patients receiving combination therapy."
