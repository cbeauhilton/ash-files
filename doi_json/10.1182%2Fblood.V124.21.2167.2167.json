    "abstract_text": "Background : As patient-centered care advances, measurement of health-related quality of life (HRQL) has become increasingly important when assessing the impact of a disease or therapy on a child. Red blood cell transfusions are an effective preventative therapy for some acute and chronic complications in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). This study aimed to determine the impact of transfusion therapy on health-related quality of life (HRQL) outcomes of children with SCD. Procedure : Children (n = 196) who participated in the Multicenter Silent Infarct Transfusion (SIT) Trial were grouped per protocol into either those who received 18 months or more of transfusion or less than 18 months of transfusion (observation). Parents/guardians of children ages 5 to 18 years completed assessments of HRQL using the Child Health Questionnaire at baseline and at the time of study exit or neurological event, if that occurred. Results : Children (43% female) had a mean age of 9.55 years ( SD = 2.59) at study enrollment, and 92% were Black. There were no differences between study groups (effectively transfused vs. observation) in regards to gender, disease severity, rates of pain and acute chest syndrome, or baseline levels of HRQL. At study exit, independent samples t-tests revealed children in the effectively transfused group had significantly higher scores than the observation group for the following HRQL domains: Physical Function ( M = 12.68, SE = 3.52), t (174) = 3.61, p \u2264 0.001; Bodily Pain ( M = 13.16, SE = 3.74), t (174) = 3.51, p \u2264 0.001; and Change in Health ( M = 0.39, SE = 0.14), t(166) = 2.71, p=0.01. Additionally, children in the effectively transfused group scored 4.98 ( SE = 1.98) points higher on Physical Summary Scores than children in the observation group, t (170) = 2.52, p = 0.01. Thus, parents report that children who received at least 18 months of transfusions had better overall physical functioning, less bodily pain, and more improved overall health than children who had fewer than 18 months of transfusions. Both groups reported changes in HRQL over time. Compared to study entry, paired samples t-tests revealed children in the observation group indicated an increase of 0.42 ( SE = 0.14) points for Change in Health scores [ t (77) = 3.06, p \u2264 0.001], but had a decrease of 5.95 ( SE = 2.07) points for Self-Esteem at study exit, t (85) = -2.87, p = 0.01. Children in the transfusion group improved by 7.22 ( SE = 3.11) points in regards to pain over the course of the study, t (78) = 2.32, p = 0.02. Additionally, these children had better overall health as exhibited by their Change in Health scores ( M D = 0.93, SE = 0.14), t (72) = 6.80, p = \u2264 0.001, and General Health scores ( M D = 4.13, SE = 1.83), t (77) = 2.26, p = 0.03. Further improvements over time were noted for the effectively transfused group for Physical Functioning ( M D = 6.58, SE = 3.09), t (78) = 2.13, p = 0.04, and Physical Summary Scores( M D = 4.89, SE = 1.82), t (73) = 2.69, p = 0.01. Although both study groups reported improvements in Change in Health scores over the course of the study (Effectively Transfused: M D = 0.93, SE = 0.14; Observation: M D = 0.42, SE = 0.14), an estimated Least Square Means analysis revealed children in the observation group did not improve as much as children in the effectively transfused group, Difference Estimate = -0.46, p = 0.02. Conclusions : This study provides the first evidence that blood transfusion improves HRQL in children with SCD. Children in the SIT trial who received at least 18 months of chronic blood transfusion therapy felt better and had better overall HRQL than those who had less than 18 months of transfusion therapy.
