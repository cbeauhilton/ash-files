    "abstract_text": "Background: The early mortality rates in older patients (generally defined as those > 60 years) following standard therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), has spurred numerous trials of \u201ctargeted\u201d treatments, typically limited to this age group. Here we examine whether younger patients with Zubrod performance status (PS) 2 might also be candidates for these therapies. Patients and Methods: We reviewed the records of 1841 patients 40 years or older with newly diagnosed AML (no acute promyelocytic leukemia) who received cytarabine-containing therapy at M. D. Anderson from 1980 to 2007. We chose patients with the following pretreatment characteristics because they are conventional criteria for entry onto trials of new therapies: PS 0\u20132, bilirubin < 2 mg/dL, and creatinine < 2 mg/dL. We calculated death rates by age and PS at 28 and 42 days after initiation of induction therapy. Results: Induction death rates in patients with AML by age and performance status The 28-day death rates in patients age 50\u201359 years with PS 2 were similar to those in patients \u2265 60 years with PS 0\u20131, and the 42-day death rates in the patients age 50\u201359 years with PS 2 were similar to those in patients age 60\u201379 with PS 0\u20131. Conclusion: Because of the high death rates following AML therapy in patients age 50\u201359 with PS 2, these patients should be eligible for targeted treatments now limited to older patients.
