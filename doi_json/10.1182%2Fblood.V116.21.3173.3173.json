    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3173 Background: We evaluated the utility of screening for VTE using a previously developed clinical risk score (Khorana et al, Blood 2008) in a prospective cohort of cancer patients initiating outpatient chemotherapy but not receiving thromboprophylaxis. Methods: Cancer patients initiating a new chemotherapy regimen and deemed high-risk based on a predictive risk model (score \u22653) were enrolled on an ongoing prospective cohort study with informed consent. Patients were evaluated with baseline and Q4 (\u00b1 1) week serial ultrasonography for upto 16 weeks; additionally, computed tomography scans for restaging were also evaluated for VTE. Results: Of 30 patients enrolled on study, 8 (27%) developed a VTE. This included 5 patients with DVT alone (17%), 1 patient with PE alone (3%) and 2 (7%) with both. Twenty-seven patients underwent a baseline ultrasound. Of these, 3 asymptomatic DVTs were identified (11%). Subsequent ultrasounds were performed in 18 patients at week 4 (0 DVT), 17 patients at week 8 (0 DVT) and 15 patients at week 12 (1 DVT, 7%). An additional two patients developed symptomatic DVT between weeks 1 and 4. Restaging CT scans identified an asymptomatic PE in 1 patient at week 6 and asymptomatic PE in 1 patient at week 9 with subsequent symptomatic DVT at week 10. Conclusions: In a prospective observational study, 27% of cancer outpatients deemed high-risk using a clinical risk score developed VTE, a rate much higher than observed even in hospitalized acutely ill patients. Thus, this study confirms the validity of a previously described risk score. The role of thromboprophylaxis in this population is currently being tested. The value of screening ultrasonography should be considered in high-risk patients based on this risk score. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
