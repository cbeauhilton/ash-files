    "abstract_text": "We examined a large cohort (N=2,457) of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients evaluated by the CLL Research Consortium (CRC) and found 63 (2.6%) used IGHV3-21. Comparing the Ig heavy chain third complementarity determining region (HCDR3) of the IGHV3-21 cases: 25/63 cases (39.7%) had a conserved amino acid motif (motif 1: DANGMDV) in the otherwise highly variable Ig HCDR3, as described by Tobin et al. Blood 2003. All but one of these Ig heavy chains (IgH) were paired with a lambda light chain encoded by IGLV3-21. In addition, we found that 3/63 cases (4.8%) had a previously unrecognized conserved HCDR3 amino acid motif (motif 2: DPSFYSSSWTLFDY). In contrast, these IgH invariably were paired with kappa immunoglobulin light chains (IgL) encoded by IGKV3-20. Similarly to that noted for CLL cases that use IgH encoded by unmutated IGHV1-69 (Widhopf et al. Blood Epub First Edition 2007), the pairing of IgH encoded by IGHV3-21 with IgL appears governed by the HCDR3. The non-stochastic pairing of IgH with IgL argues strongly that antigen plays a role in selecting the Ig expressed in CLL. To examine for the antigen(s) recognized by the most common Ig encoded by IGHV3-21, we isolated IgH and IgL genes expressed by IGHV3-21/IGLV3-21 CLL cases and generated recombinant antibodies, which we examined for binding to antigen(s) present on microarray of self or environmental antigens. We found that Ig encoded by IGHV3-21/IGLV3-21 had apparent specific binding for protein L, a multi-domain cell-wall protein isolated from Peptostreptococcus magnus, a Gram-positive commensal bacteria that comprise a large portion of the human bacterial gut flora. Prior studies identified that protein L is a superantigen capable of binding human Ig kappa light chains encoded by IGKV genes of the I, III, and IV subgroups, but not human Ig lambda light chains. The specific binding of IGHV3-21/IGLV3-21 to protein L suggested that protein L might play a role in the development of CLL cells that express such Ig. To test this hypothesis, we examined the capacity of various recombinant antibodies to bind protein L by ELISA. We found that lambda IgL encoded by IGLV3-21 could bind to protein L with similar activity, independent of whether this lambda IgL paired with the native IgH, IgH encoded by IGHV3-21 lacking the DANGMDV HCDR3 motif, or even irrelevant IgH encoded by IGHV4-39 that are not found paired with IGLV3-21 in the Ig expressed in CLL. Moreover, Ig formed by pairing IgH encoded by IGHV3-21 that has the DANGMDV HCDR3 motif with an IgL encoded by an IGLV that was irrelevant to IGLV3-21 did not bind protein L. These results reveal a previously unrecognized capacity of human IgL encoded by IGLV3-21 to bind the protein L superantigen of Peptostreptococcus magnus, a bacteria commonly found in the human gastrointestinal tract. However, because the binding of IGLV3-21 does not depend upon the non-stochaistic pairing of IgH and IgL observed in CLL, we reason that the capacity of IGLV3-21 to bind protein L cannot account for the selected Ig repertoire expressed in CLL, suggesting that it actually does not play a role in CLL leukemogenesis. This finding suggests that caution should be exercised when defining an antigen that is found capable of binding the restricted Ig expressed in CLL as the driving factor responsible for leukemogenesis.",
