    "abstract_text": "Somatic variants in TET2 and DNMT3A are founding mutations in hematological malignancies that both affect the epigenetic regulation of DNA methylation. Although the proteins antagonistically regulate the epigenetic mark of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC), where DNMT3A catalyzes addition of 5-mC while TET2 oxidizes 5-mC as a first step in DNA demethylation, mutations in both genes appear in a similar spectrum of human hematopoietic malignancies. Mutations in both genes often co-occur with activating mutations in oncogenic tyrosine kinases (OTKs) such as FLT3 ITD , BCR-ABL1 , JAK2 V617F , MPL W515L or mutations affecting related signaling pathways such as NRAS G12D and CALR del52 . Moreover, while the mutations exert divergent effect on primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells, they lead to similar disease phenotypes, suggesting the roles of these mutations in hematopoietic malignancies may relate to mechanisms outside of DNA methylation. OTK-positive malignant cells accumulate high numbers of spontaneous and drug-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in comparison to normal cells, but they manage to survive because of their enhanced/altered ability to repair these breaks. DSBs, the most lethal DNA lesions, are repaired by two major mechanisms, BRCA1/2-dependent homologous recombination (HR) and DNA-PK -mediated non-homologous end-joining (D-NHEJ). Both HR and D-NHEJ repair DSBs in proliferating cells, while D-NHEJ plays a major role in quiescent cells. PARP1 -dependent alternative NHEJ (Alt-NHEJ) serves as back-up in both proliferating and quiescent cells. The existence of these redundant pathways creates the opportunity to employ a phenomenon called \"synthetic lethality\", which was originally applied to eliminate cancer cells with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 by PARP inhibitor (PARPi). Our previous report [ M. Nieborowska-Skorska et al., Gene expression and mutation-guided synthetic lethality eradicates proliferating and quiescent leukemia cells. J Clin Invest 127 , 2392-2406 (2017) ] suggested that certain leukemias are sensitive to PARPi-triggered synthetic lethality. Here we show that TET2 and DNMT3A mutations exert divergent roles in regulating DNA repair activities in leukemia cells expressing OTKs. Malignant TET2 -deficient cells display downregulation of BRCA1 and LIG4 resulting in reduced activity of HR and D-NHEJ, respectively, and rely on Alt-NHEJ to protect them from the toxic effects of replication stress and drug-induced DSBs. Conversely, DNMT3A -deficient cells favor HR/D-NHEJ owing to downregulation of PARP1 and reduction of Alt-NHEJ. Consequently, malignant TET2 -deficient cells are sensitive to PARPi treatment in vitro and in vivo, whereas DNMT3A -deficient cells were resistant. Disruption of TET2 dioxygenase activity and/or TET2 - Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) binding ability were responsible for DNA repair defects and sensitivity to PARPi associated with TET2 deficiency. Moreover, mutation or deletion of WT1 mimicked the effect of TET2 mutation on DSB repair activity and sensitivity to PARPi. Our findings reveal that TET2 and WT1 mutations may serve as biomarkers of synthetic lethality triggered by PARPi, which should be explored therapeutically.
