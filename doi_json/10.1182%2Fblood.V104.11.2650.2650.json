    "abstract_text": "Chemokines acting through G-protein coupled receptors play an essential role in both the immune and inflammatory responses. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase C (PLC) are two distinct signaling molecules that have been proposed as potential candidates in the regulation of this process. Studies with knockout mice have demonstrated a critical role for PI3K\u03b3, but not PLC\u03b2, in G\u03b1i-coupled receptor-mediated neutrophil chemotaxis. We compared the chemotactic response of peripheral T-cells derived from wild type mice with mice containing loss-of-function mutations of either PI3K\u03b3, or both of the two predominant lymphocyte PLC\u03b2 isoforms (PLC\u03b22 and PLC\u03b23). In contrast to neutrophils, loss of PI3K\u03b3 did not significantly impair T-cell migration in vitro , although PI3K pharmacologic inhibitor experiments suggest that another isoform of this enzyme might contribute to T-cell migration. However, loss of PLC\u03b22\u03b23 decreased chemokine-stimulated T-cell migration in vitro. Chelation of intracellular calcium by BAPTA-AM and Quin-2 AM decreased the chemotactic response of wild type lymphocytes, but pharmacologic inhibition of PKC isoforms by GF109203x did not impair T-cell migration. This suggests that the T-cell migration defect seen in the PLC\u03b22\u03b23-null T-cells may be due to an impaired ability to increase the cytoplasmic calcium concentration, while there appears to be little requirement for PKC activity. Indeed , SDF-1\u03b1-induced calcium efflux was not detected in the PLC\u03b22\u03b23-null lymphocytes. Compared to fluorescently labeled wild type T-cells, labeled PLC\u03b22\u03b23 knockout T-cells migrated less efficiently into secondary lymphoid organs of recipient mice. This demonstrates that PLC\u03b2 is also required for migration in vivo . PLC\u03b22\u03b23-null mice develop spontaneous skin ulcers starting around 3 months of age. Histological examination of the lesions revealed a dense inflammatory infiltrate composed of neutrophils, macrophages, and plasma cells, consistent with acute and chronic inflammation. Remarkably, lymphocytes, typical of chronic inflammation, were rare to absent by histology and by paraffin immunohistochemistry for CD3, also consistent with an in vivo migratory defect of T-cells. These results show that phospholipid second messengers generated by PLC\u03b2 and isoforms of PI3K, other than PI3K\u03b3, play a critical role in lymphocyte chemotaxis. Collectively, our data demonstrate that although PLC\u03b2-mediated signaling plays no role in neutrophil chemotaxis, it makes a substantial contribution to this process within T-lymphocytes."
