    "abstract_text": "Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is one of the deadliest hematological malignancies and there is at present no efficient strategy to defeat it. New detailed insight into AML leukemia stem cells (LSCs) survival will facilitate the identification of targets for the development of new therapeutic approaches. Recent work has provided evidence that LSCs are defective in their ability to employ glycolysis, but are highly reliant on oxidative phosphorylation, and the maintenance of mitochondrial function is essential for LSCs survival. It is increasingly clear that Ca 2+ released constitutively from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is taken up by mitochondria to sustain optimal bioenergetics and cell survival. Here we report three striking findings: 1) oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related protein 4 (ORP4L) is expressed in LSCs but not in normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). 2) ORP4L is essential for LSC bioenergetics; It forms a complex with PLC\u03b23 and IP 3 receptor 1 (ITPR1) to control Ca 2+ release from the ER and subsequent cytosolic and mitochondrial parallel Ca 2+ spike oscillations that sustain pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activation and oxidative phosphorylation. 3) ORP4L inhibition eradicates LSCs in vitro and in vivo through impairment of Ca 2+ -dependent bioenergetics. These results suggest a novel role of ORP4L in governing Ca 2+ release to sustain mitochondrial function and survival of LSCs and identify ORP4L as a putative new oncoprotein and therapeutic target for LSCs elimination.
