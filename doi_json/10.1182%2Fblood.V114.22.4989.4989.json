    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4989 Introduction Recent studies have shown that JAK2 V617F, MPL W515L/K and JAK2 exon 12 mutations underlie the major molecular pathogenesis of myeloproliferative disorders (MPN). Methods To ascertain the real prevalence of these mutations and the influence of genetic susceptibility in Chinese MPN patients, we applied Allele-Specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (AS-PCR), directly sequencing and MassARRAY assay into our study. Results The positive rate of JAK2 V617F in polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) was 82.0%, 36.6% and 51.1% individually. We also found one ET patient, two PMF patients harboring MPL W515L mutation, and three PV patients harboring JAK2 exon 12 mutations. All of these patients were confirmed as JAK2 V617F negative. Moreover, clinical data demonstrated that PV patients with JAK2 exon 12 mutations had higher hemoglobin and lower age as well as WBC than PV patients with JAK2 V617F. In addition, through analysis of 4 polymorphic loci of JAK2 gene, no significant difference of distribution frequency was found among PV, ET and PMF patients. Distribution frequency of haplotype was not found to have significant difference among PV, ET and PMF patients either. Conclusion We conclude that JAK2 V617F is major molecular pathogenesis in Chinese MPN patients. MPL W515L mutation and JAK2 exon 12 mutations can also be found in JAK2 V617F negative MPN patients.
