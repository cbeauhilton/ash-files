Design: Prospective study. Setting, Patients: This study investigated 18 young adults with transfusion \u2013 dependent SCD, aged 20.7 +/\u2212 2.88 years, with full pubertal development (Tanner's stage 5) (euogonadal), and capacity to ejaculate. They were regularly transfused since early childhood and underwent chelation therapy using desferrioxamine which was replaced by deferasirox for the last 4\u20135 years. Ten were on top-up transfusion (TTx) and 8 were on exchange transfusion (ETx) regimen. At the time of the study their serum ferritin levels were 1488 +/\u2212 557ng/ml. Basal serum concentrations of FSH, LH, T and IGF-I were evaluated before and 7 days after packed red cell transfusion (PCTx). Interventions: We studied the effect of PCTx on semen parameters and the endocrine functions in these 18 patients with SCD. Main Outcome Measures and Results: After Packed RBCs Transfusion(PCTx) significant increase of Hb from 8.5 +/\u2212 1.17 g/dl to 10.5 +/\u2212 0.4 g/dl was associated with increased testosterone (12.3 +/\u2212 1.24 nmol/L to 14.23 +/\u2212 1.22nmol/L and gonadotropins' concentrations. Total sperm count increased significantly from 87.4 +/\u2212 24.6 million/ml to 146.2 +/\u2212 51.25 million/ml and total progressive sperm motility (TPM) from 40.8 +/\u2212 11.1 million/ml to 93.4 +/\u2212 38.3 million/ml, and rapid progressive sperm motility progressive motility (RPM) increased from 29.26 +/\u2212 8.75 million/ml to 67.4 +/\u2212 29 million/ml. After PCTx the total sperm count, TPM and RPM were significantly higher in the ETx group versus the TTx group. Before and after PCTx, Testosterone (T) concentrations were correlated significantly with sperm total count, volume, TPM and RPM (r = 0.53, 0.55, 0.42 and 0.38 respectively, p: 0.01). Before and after PCTx, hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations were correlated significantly with Sperm count, TPM, RPM and % of sperms with normal morphology (r= 0.60, 0.69, 0.66 and 0.86 respectively, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our study suggests that in males with SCD blood transfusion is associated with significant acute enhancement of sperm parameters and with an increased concentration of serum testosterone, LH and FSH. Improvements of sperm parameters were significantly higher in the Exchange Transfusion group vs. the Top up Transfusion group. These \u201cacute\u201d effects on spermatogenesis are reached with an unknown mechanism/s and suggest a number of pathways that need further human and/or experimental studies. Table.
