    "abstract_text": "HIFs are a family of heterodimeric transcription factors that activate multiple oncogenic signaling pathways. Thioredoxins, including thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) and thioredoxin reductases-1 and -2 (TrxR1 and TrxR2), regulate protein redox state and promote HIF stabilization. Elevated HIF and thioredoxin levels are associated with poor prognosis in solid tumors. We studied HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 in TMAs from diffuse large B-cell (DLBCL) and follicular (FL) lymphoma patient specimens, and thioredoxins and HIF in NHL cell lines by immunoblotting. Different levels of HIF expression were seen as 54% of DLBCL TMA cases had moderate-to-high HIF-1\u03b1 expression compared with 20% of FL (p=0.001). 44% of DLBCL versus 11% of FL cases had moderate-to-high expression of both HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 (p=0.0017); while 56% of the DLBCL and 32% of FL showed at least low expression of both HIF-1\u03b1 and 2\u03b1 (p=0.042). On the other hand, 27% of FL and 25% of DLBCL samples had no detectable expression of either HIF-1\u03b1 or HIF-2\u03b1. TMA Analysis for HIF  . Follicular lymphoma (n=45) .

High HIF-1\u03b1 alone was associated with inferior 2-year EFS compared with <high expression (31% vs 79%, p=0.005) with 2-year OS of 63% vs 89% (p=0.03). Analysis of FL and DLBCL subgroups showed similar inferior survival trends with high HIF-1\u03b1/HIF-2\u03b1 expression. In addition, the NHL cell lines SUDHL4 and Raji demonstrated evidence of normoxic HIF-2\u03b1 stabilization that was not seen in normal lymphocytes, while a small amount of normoxic HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization was also seen. We found increased TrxR1 expression in Namalwa, HF1, SUDHL4, Raji, and Ramos cell lines, while only Namalwa, HF1 and SUDHL4 showed Trx1 and TrxR2 activation. These data demonstrate for the first time that HIF and the thioredoxins are activated in NHL and that HIF expression may influence prognosis.",
