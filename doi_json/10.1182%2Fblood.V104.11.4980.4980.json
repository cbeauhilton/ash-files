    "abstract_text": "It has been postulated that B cells functioning as antigen-presenting cells may have an important role in the pathogenesis of GVHD. Depletion of donor cells from B-cells resulted in a low incidence of GVHD in mouse model ( Schultz et al. BMT  1995 : 16 : 289 \u2013289 ). More recently, we observed a lower incidence of chronic (and to a lesser extent acute GVHD) in patients with CLL who received an allogeneic stem cell transplantation after a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen containing rituximab ( Exp Hematol  32 : 28 \u201335, 2004 ). The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of rituximab on GVHD in the setting of a more intense chemotherapy with BEAM, in patients who received an allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell from HLA-identical siblings. To test this hypothesis, we retrospectively studied 11 consecutive patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma who received BEAM/Rituximab at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. We attempted to match these patients by age, donor-recipient gender, and donor-recipient CMV reactivity to a historical control of 44 patients with lymphoma, who received BEAM alone as a conditioning regimen, without the Rituximab. Tacrolimus and methotrexate were used for GVHD prophylaxis in both groups. A total of 10 patients in the study group, could be matched with 19 patients in the control group and were included in the final analysis. The outcome of the 2 groups is shown below:  . Rituximab-Study Group . Control Group . -value P .

This more intense conditioning regimen may induce more GVHD by enhancing T-cell cytokines release and by causing more gastrointestinal toxicity, thus allowing for a greater antigen presentation."
