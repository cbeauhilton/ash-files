    "abstract_text": "Background : Cerebral malaria is a highly prevalent infectious disease in Sub-Saharan Africa caused by the Plasmodium parasite. The pathogenesis of cerebral malaria results from damaged vascular endothelium induced by parasite sequestration, inflammatory cytokine production and vascular leakage, which results in increased brain permeability and death. While maladaptive responses from immune cells are thought to contribute, growing evidence suggests a crucial role of platelets in malaria pathophysiology. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is critical in regulating outcomes in malaria. Previous studies have demonstrated an mTOR specific inhibitor, rapamycin, is protective in a mouse model of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). However, if the mTOR pathway in platelets specifically contributes to the pathogenesis of malaria is unknown. Methods : Platelet-specific mTOR-deficient (mTOR plt-/- ) mice and littermate controls were subjected to a well-established model of ECM, using Plasmodium berghei ANKA. In addition, platelets isolated from human malaria patients were examined for differential regulation of the mTOR pathway using RNA-seq. Results : Platelet RNA-seq and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis from patients infected with P. vivax demonstrated enrichment of mTOR-associated pathways in platelets, such as mTOR signaling and p70S6K signaling, indicating mTOR associated genes are upregulated in human platelets during malaria infection. In mice infected with P. berghei ANKA, the mTOR pathway was activated in bone marrow-megakaryocytes and platelets based on phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream effector, 4E-BP1. As the mTOR pathway regulates protein translation in platelets, we examined de novo protein synthesis and observed increased protein translation in platelets isolated from mice infected with P. berghei ANKA compared to uninfected controls. To study the specific role of platelet mTOR during ECM pathogenesis, mTOR plt-/- mice and wild-type controls (mTOR plt+/+ ), were infected with P. berghei ANKA. Platelet deficient-mTOR mice had significantly (p=0.0336) prolonged survival compared to wild-type mice. Increased survival was independent of parasitemia, suggesting platelets did not alter parasite reproduction. While thrombocytopenia and anemia were similar in both genotypes, mTOR plt-/- mice had significantly reduced brain (p=0.0067) and lung (p<0.0001) vascular permeability during late-stage ECM. Interestingly, flow cytometric assessment of leukocyte recruitment to the brain demonstrated a 1.7-fold (p=0.0442) reduction in inflammatory monocytes in platelet-deficient mTOR mice. However, mTOR plt-/- mice had significantly (1.4-fold, p=0.007) more inflammatory monocytes in the blood. Interestingly, circulating platelet-monocytes aggregates were significantly less in mTOR plt-/- compared to mTOR plt+/+ (p=0.0433). Taken together, these results suggest that platelets assist in the recruitment of leukocytes to the brain vasculature during ECM, which is impaired when mTOR is ablated. Conclusions : Our data demonstrates that the mTOR pathway in platelets plays a significant role in malaria pathogenesis. Deletion of platelet mTOR reduces vascular permeability and prolongs survival during ECM. We hypothesize that altered platelet-inflammatory monocyte interactions drive this phenotype.
