    "abstract_text": "BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), although highly effective in inducing remission and improving survival in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients, fail to eliminate leukemia stem cells (LSC), which remain a potential source of relapse. Most CML patients need continued TKI treatment to prevent disease relapse, and new strategies to eliminate residual leukemia stem cells are required to enhance possibility of achieving treatment-free remission. In previous studies we have shown that increased several cytokines expressed by leukemia cells may provide a selective growth advantage to CML compared with normal long term hematopoietic stem cells (LTHSC) within the CML BM microenvironment. Studies evaluating the effects of individual factors indicated that exposure to Interleukin-1\u03b1/\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b1/\u03b2) at concentrations similar to those observed in CML BM resulted in significantly increased growth of CML compared with normal LTHSC (Cancer Cell 2012, 21:577). Consistent with previous reports (PNAS 2010, 107:16280), we observed that expression of the IL-1 receptor-associated protein (IL-1RAP), an important IL-1 signaling component, was increased in primitive CML cells, potentially explaining enhanced IL-1 sensitivity. To further evaluate the role of microenvironmental IL-1 in maintenance of CML LTHSC, we used recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) to block IL-1 receptor signaling. IL-1RA is clinically approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Purified LTHSC (Lin-Sca-1+Kit+Flt3-CD150+CD48- cells) from the SCL-tTA/BCR-ABL inducible mouse model of CML (CD45.1) and from congenic FVBN mice (CD45.2) were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and cultured with CML BM plasma, with and without IL-1RA. Culture with CML BM plasma for 7 days results in significantly increased growth of CML compared to normal LTHSC. The ratio of CML to normal cells was significantly reduced in the presence of IL-1RA (2.5\u03bcg/ml) (3.6:1 without IL-1RA, 1.7:1 with IL-1RA, p=0.0002), indicating that inhibition of IL-1 signaling reduced the growth advantage of CML LTHSC cultured in CML BM plasma. We next investigated the effect of IL-1RA on CML hematopoiesis in vivo . BM cells from CML mice (CD45.1) were transplanted into congenic FVBN mice (CD45.2) to generate CML-like disease in recipient mice. Four weeks after transplantation mice were treated with Nilotinib (NIL, 50mg/kg/d, gavage), IL-1RA (150mg/kg/d s.c.), the combination of NIL and IL-1RA, or vehicle (control) for 3 weeks. Treatment with NIL plus IL-1RA resulted in significantly greater reduction in CD45.1+ CML cells in blood, and in CML LTHSC, MPP, CMP and GMP in BM, compared with NIL alone (CML LTHSC/2 femurs: control 738\u00b1122, NIL 486\u00b194, IL-1RA 525\u00b149, combination 360\u00b133, P=0.01 combination vs. Nilotinib ). Mice treated with NIL plus IL-1RA also showed significantly prolonged survival after completion of treatment compared to mice treated with NIL alone (median survival 6 days for NIL alone versus 45 days for combination, p=0.02). Following transplantation of BM cells from treated mice into 2 nd recipients (CD45.2), significantly lower CML cell engraftment in BM and reduced development of leukemia was seen after transplantation of cells from mice treated with the combination compared with NIL or untreated controls (8 out of 8 mice developed leukemia for control, 6 out of 8 for NIL, 5 out of 8 for IL-1RA, 3 out of 8 for the combination). We also studied the effect of treatment with NIL (5\u03bcm), IL-1RA (5\u03bcg/ml), NIL+IL-1RA, or vehicle for 72 hours on human CML and normal CD34+CD38+ and CD34+CD38- cells cultured with CML BM conditioned medium (CM). The combination of NIL and IL-1RA significantly reduced CML CD34+CD38+ and CD34+CD38- cell growth compared to Nilotinib alone (CD38- cells: NIL 23.7\u00b110.1%, combination 13.1\u00b18.9% of control, p<0.05), cell division (measured by CFSE labeling) (CD38- proliferation index: NIL 3.3\u00b11.0, combination 2.4\u00b10.6, p=0.06) and CFC frequency in methylcellulose progenitor assays (CD38- cells: NIL 67\u00b122 per 1000 cells, combination 39\u00b126, p<0.05); and moderately increased apoptosis of CML CD34+CD38- cells. We conclude that inhibition of microenvironmental IL-1 signaling using IL-1RA significantly increases inhibition of self-renewing murine and human CML stem cells in combination with NIL. Our results support further evaluation of IL-1 inhibition as a strategy to enhance elimination of CML LSC in TKI-treated patients.
