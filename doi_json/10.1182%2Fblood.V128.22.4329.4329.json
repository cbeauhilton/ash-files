    "abstract_text": "A high proportion of lower-risk del(5q) MDS patients will respond to treatment with lenalidomide. The estimated duration of transfusion-independence is 2 years including some long-lasting responses, but almost 40% of patients progress to acute leukemia by 5 years after start of treatment. As the molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression in del(5q) MDS remain to be elucidated, we do not know how to predict disease progression or how to monitor patients during lenalidomide treatment. We previously reported that small TP53 mutated subclones predict for an unfavorable outcome in del(5q) patients, and that these subclones expand with disease progression. However, whether or not other somatic mutations or factors related to the bone marrow microenvironment also contribute to disease progression has not been comprehensively assessed. We studied a longitudinal cohort of 35 low- and intermediate-1-risk del(5q) patients treated with lenalidomide (n=22), or other treatments including stem cell transplantation (n=13) by flow cytometric surveillance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) subsets, targeted sequencing of mutational patterns, and changes in the bone marrow microenvironment. In our cohort, 13 of 35 patients progressed to either higher-risk MDS (n=4) or leukemia (n=9), 12 of whom were treated with lenalidomide. Progression was associated with the detection of a restricted subset of new recurrent mutations, either alone or in combination: TP53 (n=9, p=0.0004), TET2 (n=6, p=0.006), RUNX1 (n=3, p=0.044), and PTPN11 (n=1). Regardless of whether the three mutations (TP53, TET2 and RUNX1) were present in the initial sample or whether they subsequently developed, testing positive for any of them carried a high probability (13/16, 81%) for predicting progression. For 11 out of 13 patients the new mutations were detected prior to the time point of clinical progression and the median time from detection of the mutation to clinical evidence of progression was 42 months (range 0-83.9). Thus, we were able to detect the mutation in the majority of cases well before clinical signs of disease progression. Seven of the nine patients who developed leukemia carried a TP53 mutation. Based on a median sequencing depth of 370 reads, the mutation was considered present pre-treatment in one of these patients and to have developed under treatment in the other six. Using flow cytometry for surveillance of HSPC subsets in lenalidomide-treated patients, we found that neither lenalidomide treatment nor the acquisition of additional mutations led to any uniform profound changes in the hematopoietic hierarchy unless the patient showed clinical signs of progression. Microarray analysis of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) exhibited an expression footprint consistent with MSC with high expression of typical MSC markers and absence of hematopoietic gene signatures. However, we observed only minor differences in gene expression between pre- treatment del(5q) and healthy MSC. In conclusion, while flow cytometric analysis of HSPC populations or analysis of the microenvironment had limited predictive value in this cohort of lower-risk del(5q) MDS, all patients who progressed to either higher-risk MDS or leukemia were identified by harboring recurrent mutations in a limited number of genes, i.e., TP53, RUNX1, TET2, and PTPN11. Based on our data, we advocate for conducting a prospective study aimed at investigating in a larger number of del(5q) MDS cases pre- and post-lenalidomide treatment, whether the detection of such mutations can guide clinical decision making, such as suggesting which patients should undergo hematopoietic cell transplantation.
