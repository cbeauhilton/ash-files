    "abstract_text": "The retinoid X receptor (RXR) acts as an obligate heterodimeric partner for multiple nuclear hormone receptors (NRs), including the retinoic acid receptor (RAR), thyroid receptor (TR), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR). Targeted disruption of RXR\u03b1 in the mouse yields an embryonic lethal phenotype due to impairment of cardiac development. We have utilized a conditional knockout approach to investigate the roles of NR signaling in haematopoiesis. Bone marrow cells were isolated from a mouse homozygous for a targeted mutation in which exon IV of RXR\u03b1 is flanked by loxP sites (RXR\u03b1fl/fl). This mutation permits normal expression of RXR\u03b1, but expression of cre recombinase results in excision of exon IV, abrogating expression of functional RXR\u03b1 (RXR\u03b1ko/ko). We employed a retrovirus to deliver cre to conditionally targeted haematopoietic cells. Lineage-depleted RXR\u03b1fl/fl bone marrow (BM) cells were transduced with a retrovirus that expresses a GFP-cre fusion, or with a control retrovirus expressing only EGFP. Transduced cells were isolated to >97% purity by FACS. The effect of RXR\u03b1 disruption on haematopoiesis was assessed by in vitro assays and by transplantation into strain-matched lethally irradiated recipient mice. Progenitor assays performed in methylcellulose medium supplemented with haematopoietic growth factors revealed that GFP-cre - transduced (RXR\u03b1ko/ko) grafts contain slightly fewer BFU-E and CFU-GM per 10,000 cells (60% and 80% of EGFP - transduced RXR\u03b1fl/fl cells, respectively). Long-term culture initiating cells (LTCIC) were enumerated for RXR\u03b1ko/ko and RXR\u03b1fl/fl grafts. RXR\u03b1 excision resulted in a moderate (25%) reduction in LTCIC. RXR\u03b1ko/ko HSCs grown in suspension culture (IMDM supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum, IL3, IL6, and kit ligand) for two weeks show reduced proportions of Mac1 positive (5% vs 27%) and Gr-1 positive (5% vs 12%) cells and strikingly increased CD117 positive cells (84% vs 49%). In vivo function of RXR\u03b1ko/ko HSCs was evaluated by transplantation into lethally irradiated mice. Recipients were analyzed at 2, 4, and 6 weeks post-transplantation. Two weeks after transplantation, RXR\u03b1ko/ko and RXR\u03b1fl/fl HSCs showed similar patterns of engraftment, with GFP-positive erythroid and myeloid cells found mainly in the spleen. At 4 weeks, recipients of RXR\u03b1fl/fl grafts showed significant BM engraftment of myeloid and erythroid lineages, while RXR\u03b1ko/ko recipients exhibited minimal BM engraftment. At 6 weeks post-transplant, engraftment of RXR\u03b1fl/fl cells was well-established in both BM and spleen. RXR\u03b1ko/ko HSCs showed minimal myeloid engraftment, but both spleen and BM were populated predominantly by Ter119 positive erythroid cells, which exhibit markedly dyserythropoietic morphology. This difference was reflected in peripheral blood counts; recipients of RXR\u03b1ko/ko grafts were profoundly anaemic, thrombocytopenic, and neutropenic, and pronounced RBC polychromasia and poikilocytosis. These data indicate that disruption of RXR\u03b1 in adult HSCs results in a modest reduction in early and committed progenitors in vitro, but profoundly disrupts ability to reconstitute haematopoiesis in a lethally irradiated recipient. Myeloid and megakaryocyte lineages do not engraft in recipients of RXR\u03b1ko/ko HSCs. RXR\u03b1ko/ko erythropoiesis is dysplastic and yields markedly abnormal erythrocytes. Further investigation is required to elucidate the multiple roles of RXR\u03b1 in haematopoiesis.",
