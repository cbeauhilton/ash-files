    "abstract_text": "Previous studies have suggested that expanded T-cell clones are found in the blood of 59% of patients with multiple myeloma. These expanded T-cell clones are associated with prolonged overall survival and thus it has been suggested that they may have anti-tumor activity. We have previously reported similar T-cell clones exist in the peripheral blood of patients with Waldenstrom\u2019s Macroglobulinemia (WM) by using flow cytometry to determine the T cell receptor (TCR) V\u03b2 repertoire. Expanded T-cell clones were detected in 9 of 15 (60%) patient samples. Of the nine patients with TCR V\u03b2 clones, four patients had multiple clones. The TCR V\u03b2 clones were not identical, representing a variety of families across the TCR V\u03b2 repertoire. We have previously found that while the TCRV\u03b2 + CD8 + CD57 negative subset represents polyclonal populations, the CD57 positive subset represents either monoclonal or biclonal populations. By comparing the genetic profiling of these two subsets from a statistically significant gene list, two genes have been found to be highly upregulated in the CD57 negative polyclonal subset. These two genes are i.) SESN3, a member in the Sorting Nexin (SNX) protein family which is implicated in regulating membrane traffic capable of interaction with phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (10.4 fold, p=0.0241); ii.) Epstein-Barr virus induced gene 2 (lymphocyte-specific G protein-coupled receptor) EBI2 (7.4 fold, p=0.0207): This finding is in contrast to previous report that EBI2 is expressed in B-lymphocyte cell lines and in lymphoid tissues but not in T-lymphocyte cell lines or peripheral blood T lymphocytes. For the CD57 positive clonal T cell expansions, consistent with our previous reports, CD28 expression was found to be down regulated by 2.6 fold. There are two genes found to be highly upregulated. They are i.) Granzyme B (4.3 fold, p=0.0337) also called Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte proteinase 2. This enzyme is necessary for target cell lysis in cell-mediated immune responses through caspase-dependent apoptosis; ii.) Granzyme H, also called Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte proteinase and probably necessary for target cell lysis in cell-mediated immune responses. In summary, we have shown that CD57 positive clonal T cell populations exist in some patients with WM. Importantly, microarray results have indicated some genes and proteins that may related to better patients survival as previously demonstrated in patients with Multiple Myeloma.",
