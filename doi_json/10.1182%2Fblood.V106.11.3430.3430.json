    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Transcription factor GATA-1 is essential for erythroid and megakaryocytic maturation. A role of GATA-1 in cell cycle control is suggested by the fact that GATA-1 mutations are associated with hematopoietic precursor proliferation and leukemogenesis and that defective GATA-1 expression is observed in in vitro cultures of erythroid myelodysplastic precursors. In order to study more in detail a potential role of GATA-1 dysregulation in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), we constructed lentiviral vectors with the aim to overexpress GATA-1 protein or to inhibit its production in erythroid progenitors. Methods and Results: Using RNA interference technology we tested how GATA-1 inhibition interfered with erythroid differentiation. We selected one GATA-1 specific siRNA, which abolished expression of GATA-1 protein in K562 and HEL erythroleukemic cell lines, as verified by Western blot. Interestingly, we observed in parallel to the disappearance of GATA-1 protein, decreased proliferation rates (170x for K562 and 30x for HEL after 17 days of culture) and increased apoptosis. Normal CD34+ cells cultured in our culture system and transduced with the siRNA vector were practically blocked in their erythroid differentiation: 14 % glyco+/CD36- mature erythroid cells versus 81 % in untransduced and 80 % in cultures transduced with control lentivector (obtained after 14 days of culture). Differentiation into myeloid cells was not affected. To overexpress GATA-1 we cloned the wild-type as well as a mutated, caspase-resistant, form of GATA-1 in a pWPIR-ires-GFP bicistronic lentivector. Functionality of both lentivectors was validated in HeLa cells. For the study of GATA-1 in primary human hematopoietic cells we used an in vitro culture system in which CD34+ progenitors differentiate into mature red blood cells in the presence of erythropoietin, IL-3, and SCF. Transduction of CD34+ cells with lentivectors led to increase of GATA-1 mRNA (400-fold) measured by Realtime RT-PCR and to detection of protein. No difference was observed in cell numbers, expression of erythroid differentiation markers and survival between cells transduced with control vector and with pWPIR-GATA-1-ires-GFP. CD34+ cells from 3 patients with low-risk MDS in this culture system proliferated less (15x \u00b1 13 amplification after 14 days of culture versus 72x \u00b1 35 for normal precursors) differentiated less, and became apoptotic earlier than normal cells. However, overexpression of GATA-1 did not restore proliferation rate, nor did it lead to increased erythroid differentiation, or increase in survival. Conclusion: GATA-1 overexpression was not able to overcome defective erythroid differentiation of myelodysplastic progenitors, nor did it increase differentiation of normal erythroid progenitors. On the other hand, GATA-1 inhibition in normal erythroid precursors led to blockage of erythroid differentiation. We therefore assume that either factors upstream of GATA-1 or additional, GATA-1 independent factors, are responsible for the myelodysplastic phenotype.",
