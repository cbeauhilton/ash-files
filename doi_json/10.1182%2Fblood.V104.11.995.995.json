    "abstract_text": "Children with T-lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) have a higher relapse-risk and are in-vitro more resistant to therapeutic drugs compared to ALL patients with a precursor-B phenotype. Cellular resistance to anti-cancer agents has previously shown to be associated with failure of P53 family member signaling by abrogation of P53 function due to loss-of-function mutations or dominant-negative inhibition by isoforms of P73 lacking (part of) the N-terminal transactivation domain (P73\u0394EX2, P73\u0394EX2/3, \u0394N-P73 and \u0394N\u2019-P73). Since p53 mutations are not commonly found in T-ALL, we investigated the expression levels of p73 splice variants in relation to drug resistance in children with T-ALL. Splice variants were quantitatively measured at the mRNA level in leukemic cells of 55 T-ALL patients and mononuclear cells of 12 non-leukemic controls. TA-p73 (transactivation competent), p73 \u0394 ex2 , p73 \u0394 ex2/3 , \u0394 N-p73 and \u0394 N\u2019-p73 were all found to be present at a relatively higher mRNA level in T-ALL patients than controls ( P < 0.05 for all), suggesting that expression of the TP73 gene is deregulated in T-ALL. Resistance of T-ALL cells to the DNA damaging drug daunorubicin correlated with mRNA levels of the dominant-negative variants of p73 , i.e. \u0394 N-p73 and \u0394 N\u2019-p73 (Rs = 0.38, P = 0.03). In contrast, expression of none of the variants, including \u0394 N-p73 and \u0394 N\u2019-p73 , was related to resistance of T-ALL cells to non-DNA damaging drugs (prednisolone, vincristine and L-asparaginase). In conclusion, high expression of \u0394 N-p73 and \u0394 N\u2019-p73 variants possibly contributes to resistance to DNA damaging drugs in childhood T-ALL.",
