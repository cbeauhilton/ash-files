    "abstract_text": "Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is associated with the development of a broad range of malignancies, including Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma. Differential expression of immunogenic antigens (e.g. EBV Nuclear Antigen (EBNA2-6) and Latent membrane proteins (LMPs)) is seen at the different latent phases of the viral infection. Although many EBV-associated lymphomas only express weakly immunogenic EBV antigens (e.g. EBNA1 and BARF1), lymphomas with type II or III latency express LMP1 and LMP2. Growth of such lymphomas can be curbed using adoptively transferred EBV-LMP1/2-specific T cells. Surprisingly, T cells recognizing EBV-derived peptides in the common HLA allele A*01:01 have not been found. In addition, an HLA-A*01:01-associated increased risk for EBV+ Hodgkin lymphomas and infectious mononucleosis has been reported, suggesting that HLA-A*01:01-restricted EBV-specific T cells may be absent or present at very low frequencies in these patients. A need thus exists for HLA-A*01:01-restricted EBV-specific T-cell products, especially directed against EBV-LMP1/2. Based on MHC class I peptide predictions, HLA-A*01:01-binding peptides derived from different immunogenic EBV antigens were identified and tetramer complexes were synthesized (EBNA3A-YTDHQTTPT, EBNA3A-FLQRTDLSY, BZLF1-FTPDPYQVPF, LMP2-ESEERPPTPY, LMP2-LTEWGSGNRTY). HLA-A*01:01-restricted EBV-specific T cells were present at very low frequencies in total PBMCs from all 6 donors. After sorting using flow cytometry, only EBV-LMP2-ESE specific T cells could be expanded (for 5/6 donors), yielding pure tetramer+ CD8 T-cell populations. Four out of 5 isolated T-cell populations exhibited intermediate to high avidity recognition of HLA-A*01:01-transduced TAP2-deficient T2 cells, loaded with EBV-LMP2-ESE peptide. This specific LMP2-derived peptide showed to be functionally processed, presented and recognized by EBV-LMP2-ESE-specific T cells when using HLA-A*01:01/LMP2-transduced K562 cells. To assess the suitability for TCR gene-therapy, the TCRs from the 4 functional T-cell populations were sequenced and cloned into a retroviral vector. Surprisingly, all 4 EBV-LMP2-ESE-specific T-cell populations used the TRBV6-2 gene for TCR beta-chain expression. Additionally, for TCRalpha-chain expression these populations used either TRAV12 or TRAV30. These TCRs contained small differences in the CDR3 region. Despite differences in tetramer binding, all TCRs were functional when transduced into primary CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, and CD8 negative TCR knock-out Jurkat cells, implying CD8 independent recognition. Finally, recognition of HLA-A*01:01+ EBV-LCLs demonstrated the potential of these EBV-LMP2-ESE-specific TCRs to recognize naturally occurring endogenous LMP2. In conclusion, we isolated and validated the first functional HLA-A*01:01-restricted EBV-LMP2-specific T-cell populations and TCRs, which can be used for adoptive transfer or retro/lentiviral TCR gene therapy to treat EBV-associated type II/III lymphomas, EBV + malignancies of epithelial origin and PTLDs.
