    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2771 Background: NIL is a potent, highly selective Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor approved for newly diagnosed adult pts with Philadelphia-chromosome positive (Ph+) CML-CP and in Ph+ CML-CP and accelerated-phase pts who are resistant or intolerant to IM. Achieving complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR, 3-log reduction of Bcr-Abl transcript level from the baseline mean) are favorable prognostic factors for CML. This multicenter, open-label study (ENABL) was designed to e xplore n ilotinib Bcr- Abl effects in pts with CCyR but who have suboptimal molecular response to IM. Methods: This study evaluates change in Bcr-Abl trends in 2 groups of CML-CP pts (total n = 18) who achieved CCyR but have suboptimal molecular response to IM defined as: (Group 1) treated \u2265 1 year with IM, but Bcr-Abl transcript levels did not reach \u2264 0.1% on the international scale (IS) (MMR); or (Group 2) > 1-log increase in Bcr-Abl transcript levels from best response regardless of IM treatment duration. Pts are treated with NIL 300 mg twice daily for \u2265 1 year. RQ-PCR analysis is performed by a central lab at screening, then every 3 months (mos) for Group 1. Group 2 pts are monitored by RQ-PCR monthly for the first 3 mos, then every 3 mos. The 1\u00b0 end point is change in Bcr-Abl transcript levels from a standardized baseline value by RQ-PCR at 12 mos. The data cutoff date for this analysis was June 30, 2011. Results: Eighteen pts (Group 1, n = 17; Group 2, n = 1) have been treated with NIL for a median of 17 mos on study (range 3\u201334 mos). Thirteen pts have been treated for \u2265 6 mos and 10 for \u2265 12 mos. One pt was deemed ineligible due to lack of evidence of CCyR at baseline but is included in the analysis because there was at least 1 post-baseline evaluation performed. The remaining 17 pts had CCyR at baseline. Before enrollment, pts were treated with at least 400 mg once-daily IM; the mean dose of prior IM treatment was 487 mg/day (range 342\u2013786 mg/day). Median duration of prior IM treatment was 3.4 yrs (range 1.3\u201310.2 yrs). Three pts had prior interferon treatment. All 18 pts were treated for \u2265 3 mos and had \u2265 1 post-baseline RQ-PCR result. Overall, 15 of 18 evaluable pts (83%) achieved MMR during treatment; 10 pts by 3 mos, 1 pt by 4.5 mos (measured at end of study), 1 pt by 6 mos, 2 pts by 9 mos, and 1 pt by 30 mos ( Figure 1 ). The 3 pts who did not reach MMR at any point were only followed for up to 3 mos before discontinuing from the trial but showed a decreasing Bcr-Abl trend. Overall, pts achieved a median log reduction of PCR transcript levels of 3.1 (0.08% IS) at 3 mos; median 3.3-log reduction (0.05% IS) at 6 mos, and median 3.5-log reduction (0.035% IS) at 9 mos. Four pts had > 4-log (\u2264 0.01% IS) reduction in Bcr-Abl; of these, 2 pts reached > 4.5-log (\u2264 0.0032% IS) reduction in Bcr-Abl at least once during the study. View large Download slide View large Download slide  Median Bcr-Abl transcript log reduction at 12 mos was 3.6 (0.025% IS, 1\u00b0 end point) for 10 evaluable pts. All these pts reached MMR during NIL treatment; 9 pts by 12 mos, 1 pt after 30 mos. NIL was well tolerated and brief dose interruptions were sufficient to manage most adverse events (AEs). Seven of 18 pts were dose reduced for NIL-related AEs and re-escalated if the patient recovered from the AEs. Patients were permitted to dose escalate to 400 mg b.i.d. per physician's discretion if MMR was not achieved after 6 mos (n = 1). The Grade 3 AEs reported include 2 cases of rash and 1 case each of pneumonia, squamous cell carcinoma, bladder prolapse, uterine prolapse, bradycardia, hypertension, hyperbilirubinemia and hypophosphatemia. The rashes and bradycardia were suspected to be related to NIL. No Grade 4 AEs were reported. The median dose intensity was 600 mg/day (range 300\u2013683 mg/day). Five pts were discontinued from the study (3 due to abnormal laboratory values, 1 due to an AE, and 1 due to protocol violation). No pts who experienced QTcF changes had differences > 33 msec from baseline. No QTcF prolongation > 500 msec was observed. Conclusions: NIL treatment results in high molecular response rates in CML-CP pts with suboptimal molecular responses to IM. Overall 83% of pts who switched to NIL achieved MMR, and the median Bcr-Abl log reduction for pts who reached 12 mos on study was 3.6 (0.025% IS). The IRIS study has shown that MMR rates increase with time in pts treated with IM (Hughes Blood 2010); however, this study appears to demonstrate that MMR is achieved relatively quickly in suboptimal molecular IM-treated pts when switched to NIL.
