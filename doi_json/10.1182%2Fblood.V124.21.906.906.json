    "abstract_text": "Pim kinases have been shown to play a key role as downstream effectors of growth factor signaling in hematological malignancies. We have previously described AZD1208, a novel, orally bioavailable, highly selective pan Pim kinase inhibitor, undergoing clinical testing in AML. Specifically, we had demonstrated the anti-proliferative activity of AZD1208 in models of AML and had shown that AZD1208 treatment of AML cell lines results in the dose dependent reduction of pBAD at serine 112 and p4EBP1 at serine 65 as well as pp70S6K at threonine 389 and pS6 at serine 235/236, associated with global effects on protein translation (Keeton et al. Blood 2014). Since AZD1208 is about 10-15 fold more potent against Pim-1 than Pim-2 in both enzymatic and cellular assays, we sought to assess the dependency of each of these markers on Pim-1 and/or Pim-2 for phosphorylation using a Pim-1/3 selective inhibitor (Pim-1/3) that lacks Pim-2 inhibitory activity. In vitro studies demonstrate that while the modulation of pBAD does not require inhibition of Pim-2, the regulation of 4EBP1 as well as p70S6K and S6 are dependent, at least in part, on Pim-2 activity. As these proteins are canonically regulated by mTORC1, these data are consistent with Pim-2 acting upstream of this complex; perhaps through phosphorylation of TSC2 as reported for multiple myeloma cell lines (Lu et al. Blood 2013). These observations are also supported by in vivo data. Analysis of pBAD and p4EBP1 levels in Molm16 xenografts show that maximal inhibition of pBAD (70-80% inhibition) is achieved at AZD1208 plasma concentration of about 1000 ng/ml, consistent with the estimated cellular IC 90 of pBAD inhibition in vitro . However, maximal inhibition of p4EBP1 is achieved at concentrations 3-5 fold higher. This observation is consistent with the differential potency of AZD1208 against Pim-1 and Pim-2, and with a requirement for Pim-2 inhibition for maximal p4EBP1 inhibition in this AML model. pBAD and p4EBP1 were selected as the pharmacodynamic endpoints for evaluating clinical target inhibition in patient samples. Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples were collected pre- and post-dose from relapsed, refractory AML patients enrolled in the AZD1208 Phase I dose escalation. Analysis of pBAD inhibition on day 1 of dosing shows at least 60-70% inhibition across all of the dosing cohorts. With clinical exposures on day 1 approaching 1000 ng/ml at the first dose level and exceeding 1000 ng/ml as the dose increases, the extent of pBAD inhibition seen in patients appears to be consistent with Pim-1 inhibition, as seen in preclinical models. Furthermore, and also similar to our preclinical observations, maximal inhibition of p4EBP1 in patients is achieved only at higher exposures. These data strengthen the hypothesis that BAD phosphorylation is primarily dependent on Pim-1, whereas suppression of Pim-2 activity is required for maximal inhibition of p4EBP1 in AML cells. In summary, Pim inhibition in AML cell line models and in patients treated with AZD1208 results in the inhibition of the downstream targets of Pim signaling, pBAD and p4EBP1. In vitro and in vivo , the inhibition of pBAD is consistent with inhibition of Pim-1 while inhibition of p4EBP1 indicates a requirement for Pim-2 inhibition as well. These observations are validated in patients and provide further evidence for the relevance of these biomarkers as a measure of Pim signaling in AML.
