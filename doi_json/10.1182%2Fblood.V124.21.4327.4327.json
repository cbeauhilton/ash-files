    "abstract_text": "A tight control of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence, self-renewal and differentiation is crucial for lifelong blood production. The mechanisms behind this control are still poorly understood. Here we show that mitochondrial activity determines HSC fate decisions. A low mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8m) predicts long-term multi-lineage blood reconstitution capability, as we show for freshly isolated and in vitro-cultured HSCs. However, as in vivo both quiescent and cycling HSCs have comparable \u0394\u03c8m distributions, a low \u0394\u03c8m is not per se related to quiescence but is also found in dividing cells. Indeed, using divisional tracking, we demonstrate that daughter HSCs with a low \u0394\u03c8m maintain stemness, whereas daughter cells with high \u0394\u03c8m have undergone differentiation. Strikingly, lowering the \u0394\u03c8m by chemical uncoupling of the electron transport chain leads to HSC self-renewal under culture conditions that normally induce rapid differentiation. Taken together, these data show that mitochondrial activity and fate choice are causally related in HSCs, and provides a novel method for identifying HSC potential after in vitro culture.
