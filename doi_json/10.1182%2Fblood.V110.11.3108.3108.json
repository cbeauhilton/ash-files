    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Fludarabine treatment has been shown to be beneficial for patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), and fludarabine-based combinations may even further improve outcomes in patients with CLL. However, most CLL patients eventually become fludarabine refractory, a state which is associated with a relatively short survival. Treatment of fludarabine-refractory patients is challenging, with a median survival of about 10 months. Recently, 2 phase II clinical trials (Chanan-Khan et al. JCO 2006 and Ferrajoli et al. ASH 2006) demonstrated the clinical efficacy of lenalidomide, an immunomodulatory agent, in relapsed/refractory CLL patients. We conducted a subset analysis to examine the efficacy of lenalidomide in patients who are fludarabine refractory. Methods: All patients enrolled on the 2 phase II single agent lenalidomide clinical trials were evaluated and patients with fludarabine-refractory disease (progressed while on or within 6 months of fludarabine-based therapy) were assessed for clinical efficacy of lenalidomide. Lenalidomide was given orally either at 10 mg daily for 28 days followed by 5 mg increments every 28 days to a maximum dose of 25 mg or given at 25 mg on days 1\u201321 of each 28-day cycle. Response was assessed using the NCI-WG 1996 criteria. Results: A total of 80 patients were collectively enrolled in these clinical studies. Among these, 29 were identified to have fludarabine-refractory disease. Important clinical characteristics of these patients are reported in Table 1. The overall response rate in fludarabine-refractory patients was 34.5% (10/29). Complete remission was observed in 2 (6.8%) patients. Conclusion: Lenalidomide is a novel agent with immunomodulating properties demonstrating clinical efficacy in relapsed or refractory CLL patients. Interestingly, clinical responses to single agent lenalidomide were noted despite refractoriness to fludarabine (a subset of CLL patients with poor survival and limited therapeutic options). This observation of the clinical benefit of lenalidomide independent of responsiveness to prior fludarabine is encouraging and warrants further evaluation. Table 1  . Ferrajoli et al. .
