    "abstract_text": "Stem cells are intimately associated in-vivo with discrete niches within the 3-dimensional (3-D) bone marrow micro-environment collectively provide molecular signals that mediate their differentiation and self-renewal. A recently developed Plug-Flow Bioreactor System (PluriX TM ), which closely mimics the physiological bone marrow environment by combining 3-D stromal cultures with a continuous flow system, is capable of supporting long term maintenance/expansion of transplantable human HSC. The stroma cells, growing inside the PluriX TM bioreactor on porrosive carriers enable the propagation of high density (>100-fold input) 3-D stroma cell cultures for prolonged periods of time. Within 40 days, the number of primary human stroma cells seeded in the bioreactor at a density of 5*10 4 cells/ml reached 1.5*10 6 cells/ml and the stroma cell lines reached a density of 5*10 7 \u20131*10 8 cells/ml. Three-dimensional static stroma HSC co-cultures were found to be superior to 2-D co-cultures in supporting the maintenance of CB HSC and early hematopoietic progenitors. When cord blood CD34+ cells were seeded on 2-D & 3-D stroma cell static cultures, the 3-D stroma cultures proved superior in supporting the growth of CD34+, CD34+38\u2212 and CD34+38\u2212CXCR4+ cells. The 3-D primary human stroma static cultures supported these cells 4.7, 22, 7.4 fold better than the 2-D cultures, respectively. The CD34+ cells seeded on the high-density 3-D stroma cell cultures within the PluriX TM bioreactor demonstrated significant superiority to 2-D and 3-D stroma cell static cultures and 2-D stroma cultures in supporting the growth and expansion of HSC and earlier hematopoietic progenitors. These findings verify that a system based on 3-D stroma co-cultures is preferable for ex-vivo expansion of human HSC\u2019s. The PluriX TM system offers wide-range potential for expansion of stem cells from cord blood and production of specific blood products.",
