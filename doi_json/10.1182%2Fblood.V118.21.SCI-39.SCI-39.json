    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-39 Hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) govern a mammalian cellular hypoxic response, regulating the transcription of hundreds of genes in response to low oxygen levels. Though this pathway performs critical functions under physiological conditions, increased levels of HIFs are also highly correlated with several disease states. As such, the development of artificial compounds that directly and selectively regulate HIF function is of interest. We have used a combination of biophysical, biochemical, and chemical approaches to study the structure and function of the Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domains of human HIFs, which serve as critical protein/protein interaction modules in assembling the functional HIF heterodimer. These studies have revealed the presence of a putative ligand-binding site within one of the HIF-2\u03b1 PAS domains. A series of biased and unbiased approaches were undertaken to identify compounds that bind at this site and trigger conformational changes within the domain, leading to dissociation of the HIF-2 heterodimer in vitro and in living cells. Consequently, the expression of many hypoxia-inducible genes can be coordinately downregulated by a single agent. Despite its high amino acid identity, HIF-1\u03b1 lacks a comparable ligand-binding site, indicating that these agents will be useful in deciphering differences in the biological roles of the HIF-1 and HIF-2 isoforms. The presence of a preformed cavity within HIF-2\u03b1 is particularly as exciting as it suggests the potential for direct physiological regulation of HIF-2 by endogenous metabolite(s). Together, these studies offer further insight into HIF function and regulation while providing chemical tools that advance therapeutic applications.
