    "abstract_text": "Introduction : A commitment of CB banks is to test CB units and maternal blood for multiple genetic and infectious disease markers. As a consequence, several aliquots of blood, mononuclear cells and plasma are taken during processing for immediate and delayed testing. Whereas control of identity between aliquots containing cells can be performed by DNA assays, identity controls for plasma aliquots rely only on bar-coded label systems. We hypothesize that there is soluble extra-cellular DNA (EC-DNA) and that it can be used for identity control of plasma aliquots. The aims of our study were; to determine the concentration of EC-DNA in CB-plasma, to evaluate whether genetic identity testing by STR analysis is feasible and to investigate whether EC-DNA allows infectious disease screening by nucleic acid testing (NAT). Methods : CB (n=20) was collected, processed (Rubinstein et al, PNAS 1995) and EC-DNA from 200 \u03bc l of 0.45 \u03bc m-filtered plasma was extracted both with the Qiagen and the High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid method (Roche). Presence of EC-DNA was evaluated by detection of HLA-DR and ALU gene sequences and by STR analysis (AmpFlSTR-Profiler Plus-Applied Biosystems). Purified HBV was added to CB and peripheral blood (PB) plasma, EC-DNA recovered as above and HBV-DNA assessed by real time PCR. Results : All 20 samples were positive for HLA-DR by PCR and for ALU sequence by real time PCR, confirming the presence of EC-DNA in CB-plasma in concentrations of 0.022 +/\u2212 0.012 ng/ \u03bc l at the time of CB collection, rising to 0.124 +/\u2212 0.025 ng/ \u03bc l 33 hrs later; p<0.016. Concentrations observed in CB-plasma were higher than those of adult donor plasma (PB-plasma 0.005+/\u22120.0065 ng/ \u03bc l). STR analysis was validated on cellular DNA and, when applied for EC-DNA, showed good signal strengths and low backgrounds, allowing accurate automatic allele identification with no manual corrections (genemapper software, Applied Biosystems). An increase in STR-PCR product concentration was observed when we analyzed EC-DNA samples from CB after 33hs (7017.6 +/\u2212 2014 RFU/ \u03bc l at time of CB collection and 30290.9 +/\u2212 3164 RFU/ \u03bc l after 33 hs; RFU = relative fluorescence units). HBV was recovered from all spiked units, in correspondence with the viral concentrations added. Recovery of HBV was 96 +/\u2212 21% with high and low viral concentrations. Three mothers with HBAg/HBcore positive had also HBV-DNA in PB-plasma. Six with anti-HBcore only and 70 with anti-HBs were negative. HBV-DNA was also negative in CB-plasma for all seventy nine respective newborns. Conclusions : there is infant EC-DNA in CB-plasma and viral nucleic acids can be obtained using the same extraction method. There is an increase of EC-DNA in CB over time that may reflect cell death. STR assay of EC-DNA can be a useful molecular tool for the identification of plasma aliquots used for infectious disease testing in CB banks."
