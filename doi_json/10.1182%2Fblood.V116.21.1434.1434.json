    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1434 We previously reported that patients with early-onset HIV-1 ITP develop a unique anti-platelet integrin GPIIIa antibody against the GPIIIa49-66 epitope. Anti-GPIIIa49-66 antibody-induced platelet fragmentation requires sequential activation of the platelet 12-lipoxygenase (12-LO) and NADPH oxidase to release reactive oxygen species (ROS). 12-LO is upstream of the NADPH oxidase pathway and 12(S)-HETE, the product of 12-LO, induces the same oxidative platelet fragmentation as anti-GPIIIa49-66. Since the megakaryocyte (MK) is the progenitor cells for platelets and may contain similar signal pathways, we have investigated the effect of anti-GPIIIa49-66 on MK differentiation and, in particular, the potential role of anti-GPIIIa49-66 induced ROS in this process. We first show that polyclonal anti-GPIIIa49-66 antibody isolated from HIV-1 ITP patients inhibits MK proliferation 2.5 fold in in vitro culture of mouse bone marrow Lin-/- cells driven by thrombopoietin (TPO). We also observed a 3 fold decrease in the number of MK colony-forming units in the presence of a human monoclonal anti-GPIIIa49-66 antibody we generated. However, we could not detect ROS release in DCFH-loaded MEG-01 cells treated with anti-GPIIIa49-66 antibody. In addition, 12(S)-HETE does not inhibit the in vitro differentiation of MK cell line L8057 induced by TPO. In fact, we found a dose dependent increasing of the percentage of \u03b1IIb integrin positive cells (from 17.1% to 48.7%) in in vitro culture of L8057 treated by various concentration of H 2 O 2 (from 5 to 20\u03bcM). Thus, our data suggests that ROS is not involved in the inhibition of MK differentiation induced by anti-GPIIIa49-66, in contrast to the effect that this antibody has on mature platelets. We therefore conclude that the anti-GPIIIa49-66 antibody dysregulates ROS independent \u03b23 integrin signaling to inhibit MK differentiation.
