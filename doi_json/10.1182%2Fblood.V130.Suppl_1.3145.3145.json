    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Daratumumab (D) is a human monoclonal antibody targeting CD38 that is approved as a monotherapy and in combination with standard of care regimens for patients (pts) with RRMM. Here, we provide an update of CASTOR (NCT02136134), a randomized, multicenter, phase 3 study of DVd vs Vd in pts with RRMM. Methods : Eligible pts received \u22651 prior line of therapy and were randomly assigned to receive 8 cycles (every 3 weeks) of Vd (V 1.3 mg/m 2 subcutaneously on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11; d 20 mg orally or intravenously [IV] on Days 1-2, 4-5, 8-9, and 11-12) with or without D (16 mg/kg IV once weekly in Cycles 1-3, every 3 weeks for Cycles 4-8, and every 4 weeks thereafter until progressive disease [PD]). Pts who progressed on the Vd arm were allowed to cross over and receive D monotherapy. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. Minimal residual disease (MRD) via next generation sequencing was assessed upon suspected complete response (CR) and at 6 and 12 months after the first dose at 3 sensitivity thresholds (10 -4 , 10 -5 , and 10 -6 ) using the clonoSEQ TM assay (V.1.3; Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA). Cytogenetic risk was determined by next generation sequencing: high-risk pts had t(4;14), t(14;16), and/or del17p abnormalities, and standard-risk pts were confirmed negative for these abnormalities. PFS on subsequent line of therapy (PFS2; defined as time from randomization to PD after next line of subsequent therapy or death) was also examined. Results : 251 pts received DVd and 247 pts received Vd. The median (range) age was 64.0 (30-88) years. Pts received a median of 2 (1-10) prior therapies; 61% received prior autologous stem cell transplant, 66% received prior bortezomib, 42% received prior lenalidomide, 48% received prior proteasome inhibitor plus immunomodulatory drug, and 28% were refractory to lenalidomide. Median duration of single-agent D in DVd arm after 8 cycles of Vd was 11.9 months. After median follow-up of 19.4 months, PFS was significantly prolonged and the 18-month PFS rate was higher with DVd vs Vd ( Table ). Significant PFS benefit was observed with DVd regardless of the number of prior lines of therapy received, but the benefit was most pronounced in patients receiving 1 prior line of therapy ( Table ). The overall response rate and rates of \u2265very good partial response (VGPR) and \u2265CR were significantly higher with DVd vs Vd ( Table ). MRD-negative rates were >3 times higher with DVd vs Vd in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (19% vs 4% at 10 -4 , P <0.0001; 12% vs 2% at 10 -5 , P <0.0001; 5% vs 1% at 10 -6 , P <0.005) and in pts that received 1 prior line of therapy (24% vs 4% at 10 -4 , P <0.0001; 14% vs 3% at 10 -5 , P <0.005; 7% vs 2% at 10 -6 , P =0.060). At the 10 -5 sensitivity threshold, MRD-negativity was associated with prolonged PFS. PFS2 was significantly improved with DVd vs Vd in the ITT population (hazard ratio [HR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.78; P =0.0005; Figure 1 ). No PFS2 events occurred in MRD-negative pts (at 10 -5 ) treated with DVd ( Figure 2 ). PFS2 was also prolonged in pts who received 1 prior line of therapy (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.21-0.69; P =0.0009; Figure 1 ) and in pts with \u2265VGPR (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.17-0.70; P =0.002). Among high cytogenetic risk pts (DVd, n=44; Vd, n=51), median PFS2 was not reached (NR) in DVd vs 15.9 months in Vd (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.24-1.05; P =0.0647). Time to next therapy (TTNT) was significantly longer with DVd vs Vd (median NR vs 9.7 months; HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.23-0.39; P <0.0001), and in pts who received 1 prior line of therapy (median NR vs 11.1 months; HR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.15-0.36; P <0.0001). TTNT was also significantly prolonged in high cytogenetic risk pts (median 21.2 vs 9.8 months; HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.21-0.71; P =0.0015). The most common (>10%) grade 3/4 TEAEs were thrombocytopenia (46% vs 33%), anemia (15% vs 16%), and neutropenia (14% vs 5%). A total of 10% of DVd and 9% of Vd pts discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. No new safety signals were reported. Updated efficacy and safety data will be presented. Conclusions : DVd continues to significantly prolong PFS and induce deep and durable responses. DVd improved efficacy regardless of prior lines of therapy, with pts who received only 1 prior line of therapy benefitting the most. Durable responses with 11.9 months of single-agent D in the DVd arm translated into longer PFS2 and TTNT. The safety profile of DVd remains consistent with earlier reports after longer follow-up.
