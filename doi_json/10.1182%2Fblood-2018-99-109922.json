    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Our group (Porrata et al, BBMT 2016; 22: 1017-1023) previously published that the infusion of autograft natural killer (NK) cells correlates with survival post-autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients. A limitation of our previous study was the lack of killer-immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) analysis. Thus, we set up to investigate if the infusion of autograft activating and inhibitory KIR affects survival in NHL. Methods: From December 2007 to October 2010, 122 NHL patients participated in our Phase III clinical trial. A total of 111 patients finished the trail and samples were available for analysis. We analyzed the content of the autograft for inhibitory and activating KIR using flow cytometry analysis of each apheresis collection. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed from the date of transplant. Results: With a median follow-up of 82.8 months (range: 2.1-122.3 months), patients infused with an activating NKp30 (CD158b-CD337+) KIR \u2265 0.09 x 10 9 cells/kg experienced superior OS and PFS vs < 0.09 x 10 9 cells/kg: [OS: median was not reached vs 39.8 months, 5 years OS rates of 95% (95%CI, 56%-98%) vs 43% (95%CI, 22%-48%), p < 0.0001, respectively; and PFS: median was not reached vs 12.7 months, 5-years PFS rates of 77% (95%CI, 65%-86%) vs 13% (95%CI, 6%-24%), p < 0.0001, respectively]. Patients infused with the inhibitory KIR2DL2 (CD158b+CD337-) KIR < 0.066 x 10 9 cells/kg experienced superior OS and PFS vs \u2265 0.066 x 10 9 cells/kg : [OS: median was not reached vs 48.2 months, 5 years OS rates of 86% (95%CI, 75%-93%) vs 44% (95%CI, 31%-88%), p < 0.0001, respectively; and PFS: median was not reached vs 25.6 months, 5-years PFS rates of 62% (95%CI, 49%-74%) vs 31% (95%CI, 20%-44%), p < 0.0002, respectively]. We combined NKp30 and KIR2DL2 into NKp30/KIR2DL2 ratio. Patients infused with an NKp30/KIR2DL2 ratio \u2265 1.8 experienced superior OS (Figure 1) and PFS (Figure 2) vs < 1.8 : [OS: median was not reached vs 33.4 months, 5 years OS rates of 95% (95%CI, 86%-98%) vs 33% (95%CI, 21%-47%), p < 0.0001, respectively; and PFS: median was not reached vs 14.9 months, 5-years PFS rates of 76% (95%CI, 63%-85%) vs 14% (95%CI, 7%-27%), p < 0.0001, respectively]. Multivariate analysis revealed that the NKp30/KIR2DL2 ratio was an independent predictor for OS [HR = 0.03, 95%CI 0f 0.01-0.07, p < 0.0001] and PFS [HR = 0.17, 95%CI 0f 0.09-0.31, p < 0.0001]. Conclusion: The NKp30/KIR2DL2 ratio provides a platform to develop an immunocompetent autograft to improve clinical outcomes in NHL patients undergoing ASCT. Figure 1.
