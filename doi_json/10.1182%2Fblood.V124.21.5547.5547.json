    "abstract_text": "Objective Whetherinterferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) has special therapeutic effect formyeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients with JAK2V617F mutations was not widely confirmed. Our purpose was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) in MPN patients with JAK2V617F mutations. Methods A total of 99 advanced MPN patients (including 68 polycythemia vera (PV) patients with 34 JAK2V617F mutations and 68 essential thrombocytosis (ET) with JAK2V617F mutations) patients) were enrolled to the study during 2007 to 2013 with informed consent, then they were divided into two groups: the IFN-\u03b1 group (patients received a standard dose of IFN-\u03b1 with (30-50)ug/d ) and the Hydroxyurea (HU) group (patients received a a dose of (0.25-0.5)g/d for HU). The progression-free survival rate were analyzed for a median of 32.0 (6.0 to 60.0) months follow-up period. Results The overall response rate between IFN-\u03b1 and Hydroxyurea therapy groups of essential thrombocytosis (ET) patients with JAK2V617F mutations had no significant difference (88.2% vs 85.0%, P >0.05), but the 5-year progression-free survival rate of two groups showed significant difference (88.2% vs 55.0%, P <0.05). The overall response rate (78.6% vs 82.4% ) and 5-year progression-free survival rate (57.1% vs 58.8%) between IFN-\u03b1 and Hydroxyurea therapy groups of ET patients without JAK2V617F mutations had no significant difference ( P >0.05). The overall response rate between IFN-\u03b1 and Hydroxyurea therapy groups of polycythemia vera (PV) patients with JAK2V617F mutations had no significant difference (80.0% vs 75%, P >0.05), but the 5-year progression-free survival rate of IFN-\u03b1 and Hydroxyurea therapy groups showed significant difference (86.7% vs 50.0%, P <0.05). After the treatment of IFN-\u03b1 and HU for six months, the ratio of Interferon-treated patients need to continue phlebotomy was significantly lower than hydroxyurea therapy group (8.3% vs 58.3%, P <0.05). The thromboembolic events,splenomegaly, bone marrow fibrosis of interferon treatment group were lower than hydroxyurea treatment group showed significant difference ( P <0.05). The adverse reactions of IFN-\u03b1 was moderate, most of the patients in this study could tolerate the therapy. The major side effect of hydroxyurea was hematologic adverse reactions (Grade 1-2) with mainly reduce of white blood cells and thrombocytopenia, which showed difference between IFN-\u03b1 and hydroxyurea ( P <0.05). Conclusions IFN-\u03b1 may improve the prognosis of ET and PV patients with JAK2V617F mutations. Moreover, patients with PV and JAK2V617F mutations may be benefit for the treatment of IFN-\u03b1 and could be recommended for an effective choice.
