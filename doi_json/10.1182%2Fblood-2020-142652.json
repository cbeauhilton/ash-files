    "abstract_text": "Background: Deregulation of self-renewal and differentiation programs are central to the pathogenesis of hematologic malignancies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a large class of post-transcriptional regulators that mediate repression of multiple target mRNAs and are frequently deregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). From our previous in vivo miRNA enforced expression screen in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), we identified miR-130a as a regulator of self-renewal and lineage specification. Enforced expression of miR-130a in human cord blood (CB) derived HSPC caused an expansion of HSC, block in erythroid differentiation and abnormal myelopoiesis in xenografts. Thus, we examined miR-130a expression in AML and found miR-130a to be specifically upregulated in t(8,21) AML. The translocation t(8,21) is one of the most common karyotypic abnormalities in AML, accounting up to 10% of all AML cases. The consequence of this translocation is a fusion of AML1 and ETO genes, resulting in a formation of the AML1-ETO (AE) oncofusion protein, which acts as a dominant repressor of the wild type AML1/RUNX1. The ETO moiety mediates the recruitment of the nuclear corepressor (NCoR) and histone deacetylases (HDAC1-3) to block RUNX1 target gene expression. This prevents myeloid maturation, apoptosis and promotes leukemogenesis. Here we investigated the molecular mechanism of miR-130a in t(8,21) AML and how it contributes to the leukemogenesis of this AML subtype. Results: Using the TCGA dataset and our PMCC patient cohort, we identified miR-130a to be upregulated in t(8,21) AML and high miR-130a expression was associated with worse patient overall survival. To interrogate the functional significance of elevated miR-130a in t(8,21) AML, we performed knock-down (KD) experiments in the Kasumi-1 cell line, which represents a well characterized model system for t(8,21) AML. Notably, KD of miR-130a induced a significant reduction in the CD34 + cell population and an increase in differentiated CD11b + CD15 + and pro-apoptotic annexin V + cells. We next examined the impact of miR-130a KD in CD34+ blasts from primary t(8,21) AML patient samples. In line with our findings in the Kasumi-1 cells, miR-130a KD decreased the proportion of CD34 + cells and increased the proportion of differentiated CD11b + CD15 + blasts. To investigate the effect of miR-130a KD on leukemic engraftment in vivo, we transduced CD34 + blasts from 2 patient samples and transplanted them into NSG-GF mice. miR-130a KD decreased leukemic engraftment and the proportion of transduced cells, corroborating the functional significance of high miR-130a expression in t(8,21) AML. To investigate the mechanistic action of miR-130a, we performed label-free semi-quantitative proteomics in human CB derived HSPC to uncover miR-130a targets. Surprisingly, we found the beta subunit of RUNX1, CBFb, and Transducin Beta Like 1 X-Linked Receptor 1, TBL1XR1, to be among the most repressed targets. TBL1XR1 is a component of the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) complex and is involved in NCoR degradation. Thus, we performed western and immunoprecipitations (IP) assays in Flag-AE Kasumi-1 cells following miR-130a KD to examine changes in the expression of proteins associated with the AE complex. We observed increased expression of CBF\u03b2, TBL1XR1 and CEBPA with miR-130a KD. Notably, miR-130a KD resulted in a dramatic decrease of NCoR protein levels. IP of Flag-AE showed decreased association of CBF\u03b2 and NCoR with AE, despite unaltered protein levels of AE. To investigate changes in binding occupancy of Flag-AE after miR-130a KD, we performed Cleavage Under the Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN) assay. Surprisingly, we observed 2-fold gain of AE sites in miR-130a KD sample compared to control. De novo motif enrichment analysis showed loss of motives for ETS and HOX transcription factors known to associate with AE following miR-130a KD. Genomic distribution of the peaks revealed a dramatic shift of AE peaks away from the promoter region to introns in miR-130a KD. Pathway enrichment analysis of the unique peaks gained in miR-130a KD showed stress responses and organelle disassembly, in line with the differentiation phenotype observed with miR-130a KD. Collectively, we uncovered a novel mechanism by which miR-130a reinforces the aberrant AE molecular program by controlling the composition and binding of the AE complex.
