Adoption of a non-invasive hemoglobin estimation may increase blood donor recruitment. Masimo Pronto-7 Pulse CO-oximetry device is a spectrophotometry based device used to estimate the hemoglobin (Hb) level non-invasively, waiving the need of blood sampling. It has not been validated in normal blood donors. The primary objective of our study was to validate the pulse CO-oximetry based hemoglobin estimation in normal blood donors. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study on 106 whole blood donors attending the blood bank of a tertiary care center over 4 weeks. We estimated a Spot Hemoglobin (Sp Hb) concentration using Masimo Pronto-7 Pulse CO-oximetry device (two measurements per donor) and compared it to a venous sample Hb (Reference Hemoglobin; Ref Hb) measured using Abbott CELL-DYN Sapphire hematology analyzer. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination (R 2 ). The multivariable linear regression model of predicting the estimation differences included age, gender, weight, height, blood pressure and reference hemoglobin. Results: We enrolled 106 donors (98 males, 8 females) with a mean age of 27 years (SD 6.2; 18\u201349) and a mean Ref Hb of 14.2 g/dL (SD 1.2; 11.5\u201317). The mean Sp Hb was 14.4 g/dL (SD 1.2; 11.3\u201316.7). The correlation coefficient between the Sp Hb and Ref Hb was 0.46 (R 2 = 21%) with a mean difference of 0.2 g/dL (SD 1.2; \u22124.5 to 3). In the multivariable model, height (p =0.015) and Ref Hb level (p <0.001) were statistically significant predictors of the difference in measurement. There was a strong correlation between the two CO-oximetry Hb measurements (correlation coefficient 0.78, R 2 = 60%). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated the validity of the CO-oximetry Hb measurement in normal blood donors and with good reproducibility. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings.
