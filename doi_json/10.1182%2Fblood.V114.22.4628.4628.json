    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4628 Aim In this study we evaluated to pulmonary functions and determined relations of these findings with clinical parameters in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) who were at follow up in our pediatric heamatology clinic. Materials and Methods 24 children with sickle cell anemia and 9 healthy children as control group include to the study. Complete blood count, hemoglobin electrophoresis and biochemical values were eveluated for both groups. At pulmonology department, the carbonmonoxide diffusion test performing for both groups. At the same day spirometric respiratory function evaluation and exercise test performed both groups at department of sports physiology. The data recieved are compared statistics. Results HbS, HbF, SGPT, ferritin, total bilirubine, direkt bilirubine and Fe ++ values were high at patient group (p<0.05). Hemoglobin and hematocrit values were low at patient group according to control group as expected (p<0.05). The number of SCA patient who had one-three venoocclusive crises (VOC) were 14 (58.3%), patient who had three or more VOC were 7 (29.2%) and patient who had no VOC were 3 (12.5%). The number of patient who had acute chest syndrome (ACS) were 5 (20.9%) and 19 patients had no ACS (79.1%). Y\u0301mpaired isole carbonmonoxide diffusion test was established at the 62.5% of the patient's. At patient group, spirometric FEV 1 and MEF25 measurement were found lower than the control group (p<0.05). At exercise test VO 2 /HR rate were lower for patient group (p<0.05). V E /VO 2 rate (p=0.023) and R (p=0.016) measurement were found higher. Conclusion Pulmonary gas transfer was found difficult in patients with SCA. Respiratory airways established obstructed in spirometric evaluation. Obstructive defficiensies have to be follow up. Oxygen pulse and respiratory exchange rates were determined low and more oxygen usage was observed for aerobic metabolic activity. With these results, y\u0301t can be say that chronic inflamation process at lung due to oxygen radicals and hipoksemia in sickle cell patients, the aerobic respiratory load was increased.
