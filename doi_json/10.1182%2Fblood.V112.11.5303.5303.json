    "abstract_text": "About 40% of the non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma (NHL) arises from extranodal tissues. Gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is the most common site and is represented more frequently by MALT lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In Brazil, despite its importance and frequency there are very few epidemiological data concerning this lymphoma. In order to study the primary gastric lymphoma features in a Brazilian population, 60 patients were retrospectively evaluated. Thirty-one patients (51.7%) were female; median age was 61 years (range 20\u201386) and median follow-up was seven years. Thirty eight (63.3%) cases were classified as DLBCL and 22 (36.6%) as MALT lymphoma and were submitted to different treatment. There were no significant differences between these two groups about gender, age, GIT symptoms, constitutional symptoms, bulky disease, bone marrow infiltration, Lugano stage, Helicobacter pylori infection and endoscopic findings. The complete remission rate was 73.1% for DLBCL and 95% for MALT lymphoma. The disease free survival in seven years was 84.8% for DLBCL and 94.1% for MALT lymphoma and overall survival rate for DLBCL was 65.7% and 92.9% for MALT lymphoma. We conclude that both DLBCL and MALT lymphoma have similar clinical presentation and seems to have a good prognosis.",
