    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Approximately 7% of unrelated hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donors are asked to donate a subsequent time to the same or different recipient. In a recent large CIBMTR study of second time donors, Stroncek et al. incidentally found that second peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collections had lower total CD34+ cells, CD34+ cells per liter of whole blood processed, and CD34+ cells per kg donor weight. Based on smaller studies, the time between the two independent PBSC donations (inter-donation interval) as well as donor sex, race and baseline lymphocyte counts appear to influence CD34+ cell yields at subsequent donations. Our objective was to retrospectively evaluate factors contributory to CD34+ cell yields at subsequent PBSC donation amongst NMDP donors. Methods. The study population consisted of filgrastim (G-CSF) mobilized PBSC donors through the NMDP/CIBMTR between 2006 and 2017, with a subsequent donation of the same product. evaluated the impact of inter-donation interval, donor demographics (age, BMI, race, sex, G-CSF dose, year of procedure, need for central line) and changes in complete blood counts (CBC), on the CD34+ cell yields/liter (x10 6 /L) of blood processed at second donation and pre-apheresis (Day 5) peripheral blood CD34+ cell counts/liter (x10 6 /L) at second donation. Linear regression was used to model log cell yields as a function of donor and collection related variables, time between donations, and changes in baseline values from first to second donation. Stepwise model building, along with interactions among significant variables were assessed. The Pearson chi-square test or the Kruskal-Wallis test compared discrete variables or continuous variables, respectively. For multivariate analysis, a significance level of 0.01 was used due to the large number of variables considered. Results : Among 513 PBSC donors who subsequently donated a second PBSC product, clinically relevant decreases in values at the second donation were observed in pre-apheresis CD34+ cells (73.9 vs. 68.6; p=0.03), CD34+cells/L blood processed (32.2 vs. 30.1; p=0.06), and total final CD34+ cell count (x10 6 ) (608 vs. 556; p=0.02). Median time interval between first and second PBSC donations was 11.7 months (range: 0.3-128.1). Using the median pre-apheresis peripheral blood CD34+ cell counts from donation 1 as the cut-off for high versus low mobilizers, we found that individuals who were likely to be high or low mobilizers at first donation were also likely to be high or low mobilizers at second donation, respectively (Table 1). This was independent of the inter-donation interval. In multivariate analyses, those with an inter-donation interval of >12 months, demonstrated higher CD34+cells/L blood processed compared to donors donating within a year (mean ratio 1.15, p<0.0001). Change in donor BMI was also a predictor for PBSC yields. If donor BMI decreased at second donation, so did the CD34+cells/L blood processed (0.74, p <0.0001). An average G-CSF dose above 960mcg was also associated with an increase in CD34+cells/L blood processed compared to donors who received less than 960mcg (1.04, p=0.005). (Table 2A). Pre-apheresis peripheral blood CD34+ cells on Day 5 of second donation were also affected by the inter-donation interval, with higher cell counts associated with a longer time interval (>12 months) between donations (1.23, p6.9) (1.3, p<0.0001) (Table 2B). Conclusions : In this large retrospective study of second time unrelated PBSC donors, a longer inter-donation interval was confirmed to be associated with better PBSC mobilization and collection. Given hematopoietic stem cell cycling times of 9-12 months in humans, where possible, repeat donors may be chosen based on these intervals to optimize PBSC yields. Changes in BMI are also to be considered while recruiting repeat donors. Some of these parameters may be improved marginally by increasing G-CSF dose within permissible limits. In most instances, however, sub-optimal mobilizers at first donation appear to donate suboptimal numbers of HSC at their subsequent donation.
