    "abstract_text": "Objective To investigate the effect of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of T cell lymphoma. Methods The clinical data of 98 patients with T cell lymphoma (T-NHL) treated by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from June 2001 to December 2015 in our center were retrospectively analyzed. Results (1) 98 T-NHL patients, 62 males and 36 females, aged 7-64 years (median age 27 years). Disease subtypes: 30 cases of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, 24 cases of NK / T cell lymphoma, 22 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL, NOS), 19 cases of variable large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and 3 cases of subcutaneous panniculitic T cell lymphoma. Transplantation type: 55 cases of autologous transplantation, 43 cases of allogeneic transplantation. The follow-up was ended in April 2016, the duration of following-up ranged from 2 to 178 months (median follow-up time was 20 months). (2) 55/98 patients with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT), 31 males and 24 females, aged 7-64 years (median age 27 years). Disease subtypes: 19 cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) , 15 cases of NK / T cell lymphoma, 13 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL, NOS), 5 cases of T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, and 3 cases of subcutaneous panniculitic T cell lymphoma. The 3 year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (EFS) were 79.6% and 58.4%, respectively. (3) 43/98 patients with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), 31 males and 12 females, aged 8-52 years (median age 27 years). Disease subtypes: 25 cases of T lymphoblastic lymphoma, 9 cases of NK / T cell lymphoma, and 9 cases of peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL, NOS). Transplant subtypes: 23 cases of haploidentical transplantation, 12 cases of HLA-identical sibling donor transplantation, 6 cases of HLA-identical unrelated donor transplantation, and 2 cases of umbilical cord blood transplantation. The 3 year EFS and OS of allo-HSCT were 58.3% and 56.7%, respectively. (4) 38/55 patients with CR1 status before auto-SCT, 3 year OS and EFS were 82.8% and 60.7% respectively. 17/55 patients with non-CR1 status before auto-HSCT, 3 year OS and EFS were 57.2% and 47.8%. Compared with non-CR1 group, the OS and PFS of CR1 group were better, but failed to show significant statistical difference (p>0.05), which may be related to the less number of cases and sub types of the two groups do not match the correlation. (5) 31/98 cases were young and high-risk patients (age < 60 years, IPI score \u22653).16/31 cases treated with allo-HSCT, the 3 year OS and EFS were 73.1% and 70.5%. 15/31 cases treated with auto-HSCT, the 3 year OS and EFS were 48.4% and 27.8%. The OS and EFS of the two groups were significantly different (P=0.001). Conclusion Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can improve the efficacy of T cell lymphoma. Auto-HSCT in first complete remission (CR1) enables T-NHL patients with greater benefit. Allo-HSCT can cure some T-NHL patients, which can be considered for the treatment of young and high-risk T-NHL patients. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
