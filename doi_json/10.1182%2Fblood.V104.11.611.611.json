    "abstract_text": "In advanced stage follicular lymphoma conventional chemotherapy is non-curative and no major improvement in overall survival has been achieved by different regimens. Similarly, MCL, a lymphoma subtype with an especially poor clinical outcome, cannot be cured by conventional chemotherapy. In 1996, the German Low Grade Lymphoma Study Group (GLSG) started a randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of two different anthracycline/anthrachinon containing regimens comparing CHOP (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 day 1, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 day 2, adriamycine 50 mg/m2 day 1, prednisone 100 mg/m2 days 1\u20135) and MCP (mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2 days 1\u20132, chlorambucil 3x3 mg/m2 days 1\u20135; prednisone 25 mg/m2 days 1\u20135). 415 previously untreated patients with advanced stage indolent lymphoma were prospectively randomized to receive either 6\u20138 cycles of CHOP or MCP and are evaluable for induction therapy. 277 patients (67%) had a follicular lymphoma, 86 (21%) had a mantle cell lymphoma and 52 (13%) patients had another indolent histology. Responders up to 60 years were subsequently assigned to either myeloablative radiochemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation or to interferon-a maintenance (IFNa ), all other patients received IFNa. As stem cell mobilization was hampered in the MCP arm (only 44% sucessful mobilisations after MCP, 93% after CHOP; p=0.0003), from July 1998 all younger patients were asssigned to the CHOP arm. 86% complete and partial remissions (18% CR) were observed in the CHOP arm, whereas after MCP an overall response rate of 77% was obtained (14% CR, p=0.0094). In subgroup analysis similar improvement of remission rates were detected in follicular lymphoma (91% vs 82%, p=0.026) and mantle cell lymphomas (87% vs 73%, p=0.080). No differences, were observed, however, between both regimens for progression-free survival in both lymphoma subtypes. Overall survival was comparable for FL in both study arms (74% vs 69% at five years, p=0.29). In MCL, overall survival was slightly higher in the CHOP arm (5y OS: 57% vs. 31%; p=0.0578), but this difference was mostly due to unbalanced patient characteristics (IPI). In conclusion, CHOP appears superior to MCP in achieving a higher initial response rate but has no long term impact on response duration or overall survival.",
