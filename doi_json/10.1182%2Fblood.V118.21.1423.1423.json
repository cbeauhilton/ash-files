    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1423 Patients with B cell malignaces initially respond to current treatment modalities, however, such malignances remain incurable. Many new therapeutic options have become available during the past several years but nearly all patients develop resistance to currently available therapeutic options. Ideally, a new treatment should inhibit tumor growth, improve the efficacy of other anti-tumor agents, and improve both the overal survial and the quality of life for patients. Pterostilbene is predominantly found in Rhubarb. We synthesized bipterostilbene (5-(4-(4-(3,5-dihydroxylstyryl)phenoxy)styryl)-benzene-1,3-diol) (C 28 H 22 O 5 ) of a molecular weight of 438.48 Kda. In this study, we first examined whether bipterostilbene affects tumor cells proliferation using breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lymphoma and multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines. The results of the MTS assay demonstrated that bipterostilbene significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation of the lymphoma cell line (Raji) and the MM cell lines (RPMI1640 and MM1s) at 48 hours (IC50: 5\u03bcM for Raji, 4\u03bcM for RPMI8226, and 2 \u03bcM for MM1s). The induction of tumor cell apoptosis was most prominent at 72 hours. The extent of the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis was concentration-dependent. Bipterostilbene had minimal effects on breast and ovarian cancer cell lines. Noteworthy, bipterostilbene had no detectable cytotoxic effects on normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The molecular mechanism by which bipterostilbene mediates its effects was examined. Both the AKT and the NF-\u03baB signaling transduction pathways have been reported to play key roles in B cell metabolism, proliferation and survival. Using RT-PCR, bipterostilbene specifically inhibited AKT1 and mTOR gene expression when Raji or RPMI8226 tumor cells were treated with the IC50 concentration of bipterostilbene for 24 hours. Analysis of downstream gene products of the AKT pathway revealed that Cyclin D1 expression was slightly reduced and P21Cip and P27 kip expressions were not changed. Bipterostilbene did not alter AKT2 or AKT3 gene expression, demonstrating that this compound is specifically targeting AKT1. We further determined whether bipterostilbene interfered with IGF1-induced AKT/mTOR activation or IL-1\u03b2 \u2013mediated NF-\u03baB phosphorylation by Western blot. The results showed that bipterostilbene markedly inhibited IGF1-induced phosphorylation of AKT but did not interfere with IL-1\u03b2-induced NF-\u03baB activity and I\u03baB phosphorylation. Overall, the results of our in vitro studies demonstrate that bipterostilbene inhibits tumor cell proliferation and enhances apoptosis of B-cell malignancies via inhibition of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway with no detectable effect on the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Importantly, bipterostilbene is not cytotoxic on normal hematopoietic cells at concentrations that were highly toxic to B-cell malignancies. We propose that bipterostilbene may be better tolerated than other anti- cancer drugs that are currently being used for the treatment of B-cell malignancies.
