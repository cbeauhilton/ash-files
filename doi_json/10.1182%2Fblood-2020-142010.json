    "abstract_text": "Background: Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) encompass a highly heterogeneous group of T-cell malignancies and are generally associated with a poor prognosis. Combination chemotherapy results in consistently poorer outcomes for T-cell lymphomas compared with B-cell lymphomas. 1 There is an urgent clinical need to develop novel approaches to treatment of PTCL. While CD19- and CD20-directed immunotherapies have been successful in the treatment of B-cell malignancies, T-cell malignancies lack suitable immunotherapeutic targets. Brentuximab Vedotin, a CD30 antibody-drug conjugate, is not applicable to PTCL subtypes which do not express CD30. 2 Broadly targeting pan-T cell markers is predicted to result in extensive T-cell depletion and clinically significant immune deficiency; therefore, a more tumor-specific antigen that primarily targets the malignant T-cell clone is needed. We reasoned that since malignant T cells are clonal and express the same T-cell receptor (TCR) in a given patient, and since the TCR \u03b2 chain in human \u03b1/\u03b2 TCRs can be grouped into 24 functional V\u03b2 families targetable by monoclonal antibodies, immunotherapeutic targeting of TCR V\u03b2 families would be an attractive strategy for the treatment of T-cell malignancies. Methods: We developed a flexible approach for targeting TCR V\u03b2 families by engineering T cells to express a CD64 chimeric immune receptor (CD64-CIR), comprising a CD3\u03b6 T cell signaling endodomain, CD28 costimulatory domain, and the high-affinity Fc gamma receptor I, CD64. T cells expressing CD64-CIR are predicted to be directed to tumor cells by V\u03b2-specific monoclonal antibodies that target tumor cell TCR, leading to T cell activation and induction of tumor cell death by T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Results: This concept was first evaluated in vitro using cell lines. SupT1 T-cell lymphoblasts, which do not express a native functioning TCR, were stably transduced to express a V\u03b212+ MART-1 specific TCR, resulting in a V\u03b212 TCR expressing target T cell line. 3 V\u03b2 family specific cytolysis was confirmed by chromium release assays using co-culture of CD64 CIR transduced T cells with the engineered SupT1-V\u03b212 cell line in the presence of V\u03b212 monoclonal antibody. Percent specific lysis was calculated as (experimental - spontaneous lysis / maximal - spontaneous lysis) x 100. Controls using no antibody, V\u03b28 antibody, and untransduced T cells did not show significant cytolysis (figure A). Next, the Jurkat T cell leukemic cell line, which expresses a native V\u03b28 TCR, was used as targets in co-culture. Again, V\u03b2 family target specific cytolysis was achieved in the presence of CD64 CIR T cells and V\u03b28, but not V\u03b212 control antibody. Having demonstrated V\u03b2 family specific cytolysis in vitro using target T cell lines, we next evaluated TCR V\u03b2 family targeting in vivo . Immunodeficient mice were injected with SupT1-V\u03b212 or Jurkat T cells with the appropriate targeting V\u03b2 antibody, and either CD64 CIR T cells or control untransduced T cells. The cell lines were transfected with firefly luciferase and tumor growth was measured by bioluminescence. The CD64 CIR T cells, but not untransduced T cells, in conjunction with the appropriate V\u03b2 antibody, successfully controlled tumor growth (figure B). Our results provide proof-of-concept that TCR V\u03b2 family specific T cell-mediated cytolysis is feasible, and informs the development of novel immunotherapies that target TCR V\u03b2 families in T-cell malignancies. Unlike approaches that target pan-T cell antigens, this approach is not expected to cause substantial immune deficiency and could lead to a significant advance in the treatment of T-cell malignancies including PTCL.
