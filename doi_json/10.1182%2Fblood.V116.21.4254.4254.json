    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4254 Heme is indispensable for the function of all aerobic cells as a prosthetic group of innumerable proteins. However, \u201cfree heme\u201d (uncommitted) can initiate the formation of free radicals and cause lipid peroxidation, which can lead to cellular damage and tissue injury. Therefore, the rate of heme biosynthesis and catabolism must be well balanced by tight control mechanisms. The highest amounts of organismal heme (75-80%) are present in circulating red blood cells (RBC), whose precursors synthesize heme with rates that are at least one order of magnitude higher (on the per cell basis) than those in the liver \u2013 the second most active heme producer in the body. The degradation of heme is exclusively carried out by heme oxygenases 1 and 2 (HO1 and HO2), which catalyze the rate-limiting step in the oxidative degradation of heme. Although the heme-inducible HO isoform, HO1, has been extensively studied in hepatocytes and many other non-erythroid cells, virtually nothing is known about the expression of HO1 in developing RBC. Similarly, it is unknown whether HO1 plays any role in erythroid cell development under physiological or pathophysiological conditions. Using both a murine erythroleukemia cell line (MEL) and primary erythroid cells isolated from mouse fetal livers, we have demonstrated that during erythroid differentiation HO1 is up-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels. This increase in HO1 can be prevented by succinylacetone (SA), an inhibitor of heme synthesis that blocks 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase. These data suggest that in developing RBC, in addition to the continuous assembly of heme with globin chains, there is an increase in levels of uncommitted heme, which upregulates HO1 expression. Additionally, we have shown that down-regulation of HO1 via siRNA increased hemoglobinization in differentiating MEL cells. In contrast, induction of HO1 expression by NaAsO 2 reduced the hemoglobinization of MEL cells. This effect could be reversed to control levels by the addition of HO1 inhibitor tin-protophorphyrin (SnPP). These results show that in differentiating erythroid cells the balance between levels of heme and HO1 have to be tightly regulated to maintain hemoglobinization at appropriate levels. Our results lead us to propose that disturbances in HO1 expression could play a role in some pathophysiological conditions such as thalassemias.
