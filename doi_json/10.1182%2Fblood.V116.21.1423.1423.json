    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1423 Acquired factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitor is an uncommon condition, with an incidence of \u2242f1.5 cases/million/year, as reported by Collins et al. (Blood 2007 . 109: p. 1870\u20131877) in a two year observational study in the UK. However, this is a serious condition, characterized by auto-antibodies against circulating factor VIII and has high mortality from bleeding. Controlling the acute bleeding event with FVIII inhibitor bypassing agents like recombinant activated factor VII or activated prothrombin complex concentrates is of utmost importance. Equally important is the eradication of inhibitor, in order to restore normal hemostasis. There are several approaches for inhibitor eradication, including, but not limited to, the use of Corticosteroids, Cyclophosphamide, Azathioprine, Vincristine, IVIG, Cyclosporine, Mycophenolate and, recently, Rituximab, either singly, or, in different combinations. However, there is no single standard approach. We report 4 cases of acquired FVIII inhibitor from our center that were initially treated with factor VIII bypassing agents. Inhibitor eradication was achieved by using a combination of Rituximab, Prednisone and Cyclophosphamide. Table 1: Patient Demographics and Co-morbid conditions Patient . Age (in years) . Sex/Race .

None of the patients had significant adverse effects like neutropenia, hemorrhagic cystitis or other complications, either immediately or during follow up. Thus, the combined use of Cyclophosphamide, Rituximab and Prednisone seems to be an effective and safe regimen for inhibitor eradication in patients with acquired FVIII inhibitor.
