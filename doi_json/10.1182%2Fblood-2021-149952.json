    "abstract_text": "Background: Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is a rare subtype of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Despite its higher prevalence in Asia than other regions, the clinicopathological data of SPTCL in Asian population is scarce. Materials and Methods: Patients who were diagnosed with SPTCL in Siriraj Hospital, Thailand, from 2010 to 2021 were identified. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were retrospectively collected from the hospital database. All statistics were performed in IBM SPSS Statistics Version 23. All continuous variables were reported as medians and their associated ranges. Results: A total of 48 patients, comprising of 13 males and 35 females, were included in this study. The median age of the cohort was 30 years old. Seven (14.6%) patients had previous or concurrent autoimmune diseases. Seven (14.6%) patients presented with concomitant hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) at diagnosis. Out of 14 patients who were tested for T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement, 9 were positive for at least one of monoclonal TCR-\u03b2, -\u03b3, or -\u03b4 gene rearrangement. The summary of characteristics, presentations, and laboratory results of patients were shown in Table 1 . 34 and 14 patients received immunosuppressant therapy (IMT) and chemotherapy (CMT) as their first line of treatment, respectively. The response rates were comparable in both groups. Conclusions: Clinical presentations of SPTCL in patient's cohort in Asian population are similar to those reported in Western population except a higher rate of autoimmune features. IMT and CMT resulted in similar short-term outcome. Further studies on long-term outcome and the predictive markers for treatment response will be beneficial for this rare subtype of T-cell lymphoma.
