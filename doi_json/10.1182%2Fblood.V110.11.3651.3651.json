    "abstract_text": "Lnk is an SH2 domain-containing adapter protein that inhibits cytokine signaling. Lnk\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit a marked increase in numbers of hematopoietic stem cells, megakaryocytes and platelets, presumably due to the lack of negative regulation in thrombopoietin-mediated signals by Lnk. We previously reported that Lnk might play an unanticipated role in platelet integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 outside-in signaling. Lnk\u2212/\u2212 platelets exhibited defects in full spreading on fibrinogen, clot retraction and formation of thrombi on collagen under flow conditions while they showed normal inside-out signaling ( Blood , 106 (11): 115a , 2005 ). However the mechanism(s) in which Lnk participates in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 outside-in signaling had not been elucidated. Here we report that in normal platelets Lnk forms a complex with c-Src, Syk, Fyn and adhesion and degranulation promoting adaptor protein (ADAP) but not SLP-76 in a manner dependent on \u03b1IIb\u03b23 ligation and Src kinase activation. c-Src-, but not Syk-, mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of C-terminus in Lnk appeared to be indispensable for the complex formation and Lnk-mediated function. Furthermore we have shown that Lnk is required for the association of Fyn to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and for \u03b23 subunit tyrosine phosphorylation while activation of non-receptor tyrosine kinases (c-Src and Syk) in proximity to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is independent of Lnk. Thus, these results provide new insights into Lnk function and the mechanism by which Lnk contributes to integrin signaling in the adhesion responses of platelets.",
