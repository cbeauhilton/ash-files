    "abstract_text": "Ankyrin repeat and KH domain-containing protein 1, ANKHD1, is highly expressed in myeloma cells and plays an important role in multiple myeloma (MM) progression and growth. ANKHD1 is found to be overexpressed in S phase of cell cycle in MM cells and silencing of ANKHD1 expression leads to accumulation of cells in S phase, suggesting a role in S phase progression (1). Earlier studies by our group reported that ANKHD1 silencing downregulates all replication dependent histones and that this downregulation may be associated with replication stress and DNA damage (2). We observed increased expression of \u03b3H2AX protein (phosphorylated histone H2A variant, H2AX, at Serine 139), a marker for DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and an early sign of DNA damage induced by replication stress, in ANKHD1 silenced MM cells. In the present study we further sought to investigate the mechanisms underlying the induction of DNA damage on ANKHD1 silencing. We first confirmed the increased expression of \u03b3H2AX by flow cytometry analysis and observed that both the mean fluorescence intensity as well as percentage of \u03b3H2AX positive cells were higher in ANKHD1 silenced MM cells as compared to control cells. Phosphorylation of histone 2AX requires activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH-kinase-like family of protein kinases, DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase), ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated)andATR (ATM-Rad3-related) that serves as central components of the signaling cascade initiated by DSBs. Hence, we checked for the expression of these kinases and observed increased phosphorylation of both ATM and ATR kinases in ANKHD1 silenced MM cells. There was no difference in the expressions of DNA-PKcs in control and ANKHD1 silenced cells by western blot. We next checked for the expression of CHK1 (checkpoint kinase 1) and CHK2 (checkpoint kinase 2), essential serine threonine kinases downstream of ATM and ATR. We observed a decrease in pCHK2 (phosphorylated CHK2 at Thr 68), with no change in expression of pCHK1 (phosphorylated CHK1 at Ser 345) total CHK1 or total CHK2. We also checked for expression of CDC25a (a member of the CDC25 family of dual-specificity phosphatases), that is specifically degraded in response to DNA damage (DSBs) and delays S phase progression via activation of ATM /ATR-CHK2 signaling pathway. Expression of CDC25a was significantly decreased in ANKHD1 silencing cells, confirming the induction of DSBs, and probably accounting for S phase delay on ANKHD1 silencing. Since there was decrease in active CHK2 (pCHK2) and no change in CHK1 required for degradation of CDC25a, we assume that decrease in CDC25a in ANKHD1 silenced MM cells may be via activation of ATM/ ATR pathway independent of CHK2/CHK1. Expression of several other downstream factors of DSBs induced DNA damage response and repair such as BRCA1, PTEN, DNMT1, SP1, HDAC2 were also found to be modulated in ANKHD1 silenced MM cells. In conclusion, ANKHD1 silencing in MM cells leads to DNA damage and modulates expression of several genes implicated in DNA damage and repair. DNA damage induced after ANKHD1 silencing in MM cells activates ATM/ ATR-CDC25a pathway which may lead to the activation of S phase checkpoint in MM cells. Results however are preliminary and further studies are required to understand the role of ANKHD1 in intra S phase check point.
