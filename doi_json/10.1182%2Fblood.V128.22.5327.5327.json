    "abstract_text": "Introduction : There are few reports of standard of care and outcomes in Latin America. The HOLA study is a retrospective chart review of patients with B-cell malignancies in Latin America (LATAM). Methods : The objective of this registry is to describe patient characteristics, diagnostic and treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes in patients with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) from a mix of public and private sites in Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Guatemala, and Panama. We report 1975 patients with NHL diagnosed in the period from January 2006 to March 2016. Results: Median age according to NHL subtype was: Follicular Lymphoma (FL) 58, Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) 61, Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma (DBLCL) 58 and T cell lymphoma (TCL) 49 years. The cases were reviewed starting first with patients diagnosed in 2006 onwards, lost files might bias the following distribution. (Graphic1). Immunohistochemistry tests performed for each subtype are presented. For FL valuable markers to make differential diagnosis like CD5, CD23 and CD10 are not always tested. In MCL, CD5, Cyclin D1 and Ki67 were not performed for all patients. For DLBCL markers such as CD10, Bcl6 and MUM1 were performed in 36%, 25% and 17% respectively. Cytogenetic exams are not part of the regular screening of NHL in (LATAM), performed on 6% of all lymphomas. Advances stages are frequently seen for all types of lymphoma, Ann Arbor IV 27%, 54%, 27% and 29% for FL, MCL, DLBCL and TCL respectively. Most frequent extranodal involvement site for FL and MCL was bone marrow (25.4% and 41.3% respectively) and skin for DBLCL and TCL (14% and 13%). R-CHOP is the most frequently used regimen for all types of lymphoma, except for T cell lymphoma (FL 42%, MCL 45%, DLBCL 66%, TCL 7%) Hyper CVAD is more used on MCL (11%) and TCL (14%). There was a 15% use of CHOP reported for each B cell Lymphoma. Radiotherapy consolidation is most used for DLBCL and TCL (30 and 27% respectively). Transplant was more frequent for MCL, 15% vs less than 10% for the others. Higher relapse rate was seen for MCL (49%) and TCL (44%) versus 31% and 32 % for FL and DLBCL. For relapsed NHL treatment no standard of care can be highlighted (Table 2). Conclusions: The HOLA registry is a LATAM collaborative effort to show incidences of NHL subtypes, diagnosis methodologies and treatment options in the region. HOLA registry found a higher incidence of DLBCL among other LNH subtypes than reported in other regions of the world. NHL diagnosis is a regional gap, underutilization of IH markers might be related to lack of hematopathologists or low availability of specific markers. IH markers to differentiate subtypes of DLBCL are not routinely used in LATAM. Low Cytogenetic testing of NHL in LATAM. Most common first line regimen for B cell NHL was R-CHOP. There was still 15% use of CHOP without R. This might be related to low access. Second and third line treatments were heterogeneous reflecting different available options in LATAM, but no standard of care.
