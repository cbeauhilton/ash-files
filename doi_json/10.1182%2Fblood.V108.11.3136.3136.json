    "abstract_text": "Haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HHCT) after high dose conditioning with CD34-selected stem cells has been complicated by high regimen related toxicities, slow engraftment and delayed immune reconstitution leading to increased treatment related mortality (TRM). A new regimen using graft CD3/CD19 depletion with anti-CD3 and anti-CD19 coated microbeads on a CliniMACS device and reduced intensity conditioning may allow HHCT with lower toxicity and faster engraftment. CD3/CD19 depleted grafts not only contain CD34+ stem cells but also CD34 negative progenitors, natural killer-, graft-facilitating- and dendritic-cells. Reduced intensity conditioning was performed with fludarabine (150\u2013200 mg/m\u00b2), thiotepa (10 mg/kg), melphalan (120 mg/m\u00b2) and OKT-3 (5 mg/day, day \u22125 to +14) and no posttransplant immunosuppression. Twenty two consecutive patients (median age=43 (range, 21\u201359) years) have been transplanted with this regimen. Diagnosis were AML (n=12), ALL (n=5), NHL (n=2), MM (n=2) and CML (n=1). Patients were \u201chigh risk\u201d with refractory disease or relapse after preceding HCT. The CD3/CD19 depleted haploidentical grafts contained a median of 7.6 x 10 6 (range, 3.4\u201317x10 6 ) CD34+cells/kg, 6.7x10 7 (range, 0.02\u201318.2 x10 7 ) CD56+cells/kg and 5.5x10 4 (range, 0.006\u201344x10 4 ) CD3+T-cells/kg. Donor-recipient KIR-ligand-mismatch was found in 14 of 22 patients. The regimen was well tolerated with maximum acute toxicity being grade 2\u20133 mucositis. Because of severe neurotoxicity in 4 patients treated with 200 mg/m\u00b2 fludarabine, the dose was reduced to 150 mg/m\u00b2 with no further cases of neuropathy thereafter. Engraftment was rapid with median time to >500 granulocytes/\u03bcL of 12 (range, 10\u201321) days, >20000 platelets/\u03bcL of 11 (range, 7\u201328) days and full donor chimerism after 2\u20134 weeks in all patients. Incidence of grade II\u2013IV GVHD was 59% with grade II=9, III=2 and IV=2. One patient, who received the highest T cell dose, developed lethal grade IV GVHD. TRM in the first 100 days was 6/22 (27%) with deaths due to idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (n=1), mucormycosis (n=1), pneumonia (n=3) or GVHD (n=1). Six patients died after day 100, five due to relapse and one with systemic adenoviral infection. Overall survival is 10/22 patients (45%) with a median follow-up of 185 days (range, 17\u2013988). In conclusion, this regimen is promising in high risk patients lacking a suitable donor, and a prospective phase I/II study is ongoing."
