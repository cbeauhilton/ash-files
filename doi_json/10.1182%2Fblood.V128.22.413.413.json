    "abstract_text": "The human body produces and removes 10 11 platelets daily to maintain a normal steady-state platelet count. However, the regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. We have shown that platelets lacking sialic acid (desialylated platelets) are removed by the hepatic Ashwell-Morell receptor (AMR or asialoglycoprotein receptor type 2), thereby regulating platelet survival and hepatic TPO levels. Platelet counts and lifetime were increased in Asgr2 -/- mice (AMR-null mice), compared to wild type (WT) mice. Platelet volume and immature platelet fraction (IPF) are decreased in AMR-null mice, consistent with the notion that platelets in AMR-null mice (AMR-null platelets) circulate longer and are older. By contrast, deficiency of the sialyltransferase St3gal4 gene induces a marked thrombocytopenia (St3gal4-null platelets), due to rapid platelet clearance by the hepatic AMR. Consistent with the rapid platelet clearance, platelet volume and IPF were increased in St3gal4 -/- mice, reflecting high platelet turnover and younger platelets. While both AMR-null and St3gal4-null platelets are desialylated, they differ substantially in their time, i.e. age, in circulation. Here we investigated the effects of in vivo and in vitro aging on platelet function. Freshly isolated St3gal4-null platelets showed significantly increased integrin activation when stimulated with convulxin and thrombin, while AMR-null platelets showed a significantly lower response compared to WT platelets. Secretion of \u03b1-granule was significantly increased in St3gal4-null platelets. By contrast no significant difference was measured between WT and AMR-null platelets. Despite increased platelet counts, the tail-bleeding time was significantly prolonged in AMR-null mice, compared to WT mice, suggesting that increased circulatory time (age) negatively affects platelet function in vivo . We next performed in vitro storage for up to 72 hours at room temperature to stress platelet aging. Stored St3gal4-deficient platelets had increased integrin activation, \u03b1-granule secretion in response to convulxin and thrombin and showed increased phosphatidyl serine exposure as detected by Annexin V binding in response to calcium ionophore, compared to stored control platelets. By contrast, stored AMR-null platelets had significantly impaired integrin activation, \u03b1-granule secretion and Annexin V binding compared to controls. To further evaluate the propensity to undergo apoptosis, we tested caspase-3 activation and mitochondrial membrane potential. Surprisingly, we found that both St3gal4-null (young) and AMR-null (old) platelets showed a significantly lower caspase-3 activation in response to calcium ionophore and ABT-737 compared to WT platelets. Furthermore, the mitochondrial membrane potential was lower in both St3gal4-deficient and AMR-null platelets compared to WT platelets, indicating functionally impaired mitochondria. Taken together, our data indicate that younger St3gal4-null platelets have an increased baseline function while by contrast older AMR-null platelets have decreased function in vitro and in vivo . Interestingly, younger and older (longer circulating platelets) had reduced propensity to undergo apoptosis and impaired mitochondrial function. Overall, younger platelets represent a highly favorable profile during storage. Identification of donors with a larger fraction of younger platelets could result in safer and more efficacious platelet transfusions. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
