    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5149 Background: Polycythemia vera (PV) is a heterogeneous myeloproliferative disease characterized by expansion of morphologically normal red blood cells, granulocytes, and platelets with varying degrees of bone marrow fibrosis (BMF) during the disease course. BMF as a result of abnormal deposition of reticulin and collagen fibers in bone marrow stroma plays a role in the pathophysiology and clinical manifestation of myeloproliferative disorders in general. However, in PV, older age and previous history of thrombosis remain the only two major risk factors for consideration in decisions regarding therapy. Objectives: To investigate the characteristics associated with BMF and its prognostic impact on clinical manifestation, overall survival (OS), and transformation to primary myelofibrosis and acute leukemia in patients with PV. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review analysis of 115 patients who were diagnosed with PV according to World Health Organization criteria and were referred to MD Anderson Cancer Center between May 2000 and December 2009. Results of the first bone marrow biopsy done at MD Anderson were reviewed. BMF was documented according to the European consensus grading system (MF0-3), in which MF-3 is the most severe grade of fibrosis. Results: Of the 115 patients, 23 (20%) had MF-0, 46 (40%) MF-1, 36 (31%) MF-2, and 10 (9%) MF-3. Table 1 summarizes patient characteristics and outcomes by grade.

There was no association between BMF severity and the demographic or symptoms of the disease. There was no association between BMF severity and the presence of JAK2 mutation or cytogenetic abnormalities. There was no impact of BMF on OS, EFS, or transformation to myelofibrosis or acute leukemia. However, longer follow-up is needed to investigate further the impact of BMF on OS and transformation-free survival. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
