    "abstract_text": "CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP\u03b1) is a myeloid specific transcription factor that coordinates cellular differentiation and cell cycle arrest. Loss of C/EBP\u03b1 expression or function in leukemic blasts contributes to a block in myeloid cell differentiation. C/EBP\u03b1 is mutated in around 9% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The mutations reported in C/EBP\u03b1 are frame shift mutations and point mutations at basic region Leucine zipper. The mutant form of C/EBP\u03b1 ie C/EBP\u03b1-p30 exhibits dominant negative function over the wild type protein. The role of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, Pin1 in tumorogenesis and its overexpression in many cancers led us to investigate its role in acute myeloid leukemia with C/EBP\u03b1 mutation. Here we show that Pin1 is upregulated in patients with acute myeloid leukemia by affymetrix analysis. By quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR analysis, we show C/EBP\u03b1-p30 could induce Pin1 transcription, while the wild type C/EBP\u03b1 downregulates Pin1 expression. Luciferase promoter assay for the Pin1 promoter shows that wild type C/EBP\u03b1 is able to block Pin1 promoter activity. Mean while, C/EBP\u03b1-p30 couldn\u2019t block Pin1 promotor activity. By silencing Pin1 by RNA Interference as well as with inhibitor against Pin1 (PiB) we could show myeloid differentiation in human CD34 + cord blood cells as well as in Kasumi-6 cells as assessed by FACS analysis with granulocytic markers. We investigated the mechanism underlying the dominant negative action of C/EBP\u03b1-p30 over the wild type protein. We report that Pin1 increases the transcriptional activity of the oncogene c-jun. We also show that c-jun blocks the DNA binding and transactivation of C/EBP\u03b1 protein as assessed by gel shift assay and promoter assay respectively. We have previously shown that c-jun expression is high in AML patients with C/EBP\u03b1 mutation and c-jun could block C/EBP\u03b1 function by protein-protein interaction. Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR analysis shows that inhibition of Pin1 by the inhibitor PiB downregulates c-jun mRNA expression. In conclusion, inhibition of Pin1 leads to granulocytic differentiation. Our results show Pin1 as a novel target in treating AML patients with C/EBP\u03b1 mutation."
