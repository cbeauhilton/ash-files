    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4560 Introduction The G-CSF, primary regulator of granulopoiesis, has shown its efficacy in reducing duration of neutropenia after chemotherapy or myelosuppressive therapy. In these situations G-CSF, accelerating the granulocytous reconstitution, may enable a significant reduction of the incidence, duration and severity of infection. Commercially formulations of rHu-G-CSF include lenograstim, a glycosylated form, and filgrastim, a non-glycosylated form. Glycosylation of the molecule contribute to pharmacokynetis advantages and to higher affinity to specific receptor. Additionally, lenograstim exposed neutrophils maintain unchanged all their functions in vitro, while filgrastim exposed neutrophils present functional defects due to higher adhesivity, cytoscheletric alterations and a more immature phenotype. Aim On these bases, we hypotized that lenograstim may prevent febrile episodes (FE) and reduce their lasting in patients with chemotherapy derived neutropenia more efficiently than filgrastim. Primary endpoint is the incidence of FE (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT00932217 ). Patients and methods starting from April 2005, 180 multiple myeloma patients achieving high dose cyclophosphamide for stem cells mobilization were enrolled in 11 Italian Centers. Treatment plan consisted in: high dose cyclophosphamide (3 or 4 g/sqm) on day 1, G-CSF (random 1:1 on the base of a generated random list: filgrastim or lenograstim) 30 MU/day from day +4 to +9, 60 MU/day from day +10 to the achievement of an optimal CD34+ cell count for staminoapheresis. FE, significant if equal or higher than 38 \u00b0C for at least 2 different determinations, were recorded till day +30. Results 176 of 180 patients received scheduled treatment and are eligible for final analyses. All 176 patients underwent post-chemo grade 4 neutropenia and G-CSF was administered starting from day +4. FE were recorded in 26 pts, 16 in the filgrastim arm (89 total patients) and 10 in the lenograstim arm (87 total patients). The global fever incidence was 14.77%, 17.98% with filgrastim and 11.49% with lenograstim. However, to demonstrate functional block of filgrastim exposed neutrophils, FE have been related to neutrophil absolute count. Related to the neutropenia grade, 8 FE are recorded with filgrastim (8.99%) and 1 FE with lenograstim (1.15%) with absolute neutrophil count >500/\u03bcL (grade 3) (chi square test with Yates' correction: p=0.0436); this difference is still evident when neutrophils are >1000/\u03bcL (grade 2), with 7 episodes with filgrastim (7.87%) versus 1 (1.15%) with lenograstim. Conclusions Lenograstim is associated with a reduced global incidence of FE in multiple myeloma patients undergoing to high dose cyclophosphamide and stem cells mobilization when compared to filgrastim. Additionally, excluding the time frame when neutrophils are not yet recovered (neutrophils 500/\u03bcL) in treated patients. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
