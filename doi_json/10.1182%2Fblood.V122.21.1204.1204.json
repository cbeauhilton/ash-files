    "abstract_text": "Loss-of-function mutations in Ten-Eleven-Translocation 2 ( TET2 ) gene have been identified in various human myeloid and lymphoid malignancies. Recently, the TET gene family ( TET1 , TET2 , and TET3 ) was found to function as DNA methylcytosine dioxygenase that is able to oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC). In Tet2 -deficient mouse models, Tet2 has been shown to play an important role in regulating self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. These Tet2 -deficient mice would gradually develop a chronic myeloid neoplasm resembling human chronic myelomonocytic leukemia suggesting that TET2 may function as a tumor suppressor. In the present study, we investigated the role of tet2 in zebrafish early hematopoiesis. During zebrafish early development, the expression of tet1 , tet2 , and tet3 by qRT-PCR can be detected mainly after the segmentation stage (26-somite), with fluctuated expression levels thereafter. Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that tet2 expression was strong over aorta-gonad-mesonephros region at 48 hours post-fertilization (hpf). Morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) knock-down of tet2 increased the expression of tet1 , tet3 , dnmt3aa , gata-1 , alpha-Hb and fli1a (48 hpf) as well as rag2 and lck (4 days post-fertilization), and the expression of spi1b and mpo decreased (48 hpf). The expression of primitive hematopoietic stem cell markers scl and lmo2 , as well as dnmt3ab , beta-Hb , l-plastin , and rag1 were unaffected. The levels of 5-mC and 5-hmC measured by ELISA were also decreased after MO knock-down of tet2 . The number of gata-1 expressing red blood cells increased after tet2 MO knock-down as evaluated by flow-cytometry indicating that tet2 deficiency increased erythropoiesis. These preliminary results suggest that tet2 might play a role in the epigenetic regulation of zebrafish early hematopoiesis including erythropoiesis. Recently, transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) has been shown to generate targeted genomic editing in zebrafish. To validate our observation, we therefore utilized customized TALENs pair to generate tet2 knock-out zebrafish animal model. We designed a pair of TALENs targeting first exon of tet2 and our tet2 TALENs were able to generate insertion and/or deletion in targeted region of tet2 exon 1 in 25% to 44% zebrafish embryos. We obtained a total of fifteen different tet2 mutation genotypes F1 fish, and seven of them were predicted to cause early termination of transcription. The in-cross of these F1 genotypes matched the Mendelian inheritance. The tet2 -/- knock-out F2 zebrafish is not embryonic lethal and can grow to sexually mature adult fish. The detailed analysis of tet2 -/- knock-out zebrafish early hematopoiesis will be presented at the meeting. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
