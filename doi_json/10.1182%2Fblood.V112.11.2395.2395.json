    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Thalidomide (Thalomid\u00ae/Thalidomide Pharmion\u00ae) combined with melphalan and prednisone (MPT) yields improved progression-free and overall survival compared to MP alone ( Facon et. al., Lancet  2007 ; 370 : 1191 ). This study was designed to estimate the life-time health and cost consequences of MPT versus MP in Scottish patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to determine cost and health outcomes for a cohort of patients receiving a course of MPT or MP. The disease course was conceptualized by 4 mutually exclusive health states: pre-progression without adverse events, pre-progression with adverse event, progressive disease, and death. Probabilities of moving between these states (i.e. natural progression plus efficacy and safety of the treatments) were derived from a long-term randomized clinical trial, IFM 99-06 ( Facon et. al., Lancet  2007 ; 370 : 1191 ). Both patient cohorts remained on the assigned treatment for a maximum of twelve 6-week cycles, until progression or treatment-limiting toxicity. Treatment duration and the average daily dose were modelled to match IFM 99-06. During treatment, each cohort was exposed to adverse event risks associated with therapy estimated from IFM 99-06. Health state utilities associated with adverse events and disease states were obtained from the literature. Thalidomide cost was set at UK list price; routine disease-management costs by disease-state (progressive disease and remission state) reflect clinical practice in Scotland. As recommended by the UK treasury, costs and health outcomes were discounted at 3.5% per annum to adjust to present values. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed around key model parameters. RESULTS: The model estimated improvements in health outcomes with MPT with a median time to progression of 25 months vs. 12 months with MP. Estimated median overall survivals were 4.03 years vs. 2.88 years with MP. These results translate to a gain of 0.91 (3.24 vs. 2.32) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). MPT is associated with higher overall costs (\u00a325,199 per patient) compared with MP (\u00a38,935), over the modeled life-time, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \u00a317,847 per QALY and \u00a314,803 per life-year gained. Sensitivity analyses showed that results remained consistent through broad changes in model parameters including the addition of thromboembolic prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: MPT delivers improvements in progression-free and overall survival in a life-limiting orphan disease compared to MP and economic results fall within a range considered cost-effective in Scotland.",
