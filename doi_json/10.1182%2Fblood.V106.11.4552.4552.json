    "abstract_text": "Methylation of CpG islands in the 5\u2032 gene region is associated with transcriptional silencing of gene expression. The hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes has been described in various tumor tissues, as in gastric and pancreatic cancer, as well as in acute myeloid leukemia, suggesting its potential role in tumorigenesis. Among the three members of the Kip/Cip family of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (CKI) p21, p27 and p57, little is known of their methylation status in hematological malignancies and contrasting studies have been reported on the role of p21 hypermethylation in the pathogenesis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The aim of our study was to analyze in primary blasts from adult ALL enrolled in the GIMEMA protocols 0496 and LAL2000 the methylation status of p21, defining in addition its protein expression by Western blot using the monoclonal antibody p21-WAF1 (Santa Cruz, CA). Primary samples from 81 untreated ALL patients were processed using a widely accepted method based on bisulfite modification of DNA, followed by the use of methylation-specific PCR assay (MSP). The human lymphoblastic cell lines (Jurkat, RPMI8866 and CEM), the myeloid cell line OCI-AML3 and normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 10 healthy donors were characterized by a consistent p21 promoter unmethylation (negative controls). In contrast, it was weakly methylated in the Raji cell line and strongly methylated in the Rael (Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma) cell line (positive controls). This assay was further validate in vitro by SsI methylase. In the present study we analyzed 54 B-lineage ALLs, 25 T-ALLs and 2 biphenothypic leukemias; the mean WBC value at diagnosis was 125.6x10 9 /L and 20 samples were Philadelphia chromosome positive. 71/81 of patients studied for p21 methylation were evaluated for response: 53 (74.6%) achieved complete remission (CR) after induction therapy, 8 (11.3%) patients were resistance and 10 (14.1%) died during induction therapy. DNA methylation was not observed in any of the adult ALL patients. p21 protein expression was found in OCI-AML3, Raji and RPMI8866 cell lines, while resulted negative in the Jurkat cell line and in normal PBL. Preliminary results obtained in the ALL samples showed that this protein was expressed in 8/29 (27.6%) cases. In summary, we demonstrated in a large number of primary ALL cases studied at presentation that the p21 gene is not methylated in this population and therefore that the status of p21 methylation does not play a role in the pathogenesis of adult ALL.",
