    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2452 Deletion of chromosome 5q in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients results in loss of miR-146a, which is a negative regulator of the innate immune pathway by targeting TNF receptor associated factor-6 (TRAF6). Therefore, MDS and AML patients with reduced miR-146a expression concomitantly exhibit elevated TRAF6 protein. TRAF6 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on substrates that lead to pathway activation, one of which includes NF-kB. Mice lacking miR-146a, or with overexpression of TRAF6, develop AML- and MDS-like features. Bortezomib (Velcade \u00a9 ), which shows promise alone or in combination with chemotherapy in certain groups of MDS and AML patients, is a selective and reversible inhibitor of the 26S proteasome. Studies on the mechanism of action of Bortezomib have shown that pro-apoptotic proteins are stabilized following proteasome inhibition and contribute to the anti-cancer effect. In this report, paradoxically, we find that Bortezomib induces rapid and complete degradation of TRAF6 protein, but not mRNA, in MDS/AML cell lines and human CD34 + cells. A similar finding was observed when AML cells were treated with MG132, another proteasome inhibitor, indicating that degradation of TRAF6 is secondary to proteasomal inhibition. Interestingly, the reduction in TRAF6 protein coincides with Bortezomib-induced autophagy, as indicated by conversion of LC3B-I to LC3B-II and degradation of SQSTM1/p62, and subsequently with apoptosis in MDS/AML cells. Addition of an autophagy inhibitor (3-methyladenine [3-MA]) to Bortezomib-treated AML cells maintained TRAF6 protein expression and enhanced cell viability. Similarly, TRAF6 degradation was blocked by 3-MA when cells were treated with Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor and inducer of autophagy. These findings suggest that a mechanism of Bortezomib-induced cell death in myeloid malignancies involves elimination of TRAF6 protein by autophagosomes. Forced expression of TRAF6 in two AML cell lines partially blocked the cytotoxic effect of Bortezomib, suggesting that TRAF6 is an important target of Bortezomib. To determine whether loss of TRAF6 is sufficient to impede growth of MDS and AML, we used a genetic approach to inhibit TRAF6 in MDS/AML cell lines and bone marrow cells from MDS patients with deletion of chromosome 5q. RNAi-mediated depletion of TRAF6 in MDS and AML samples resulted in impaired malignant hematopoietic stem/progenitor function and rapid apoptosis. To uncover the molecular consequences following loss of TRAF6, we applied gene expression profiling and identified genes relevant to the survival of MDS and AML cells. In summary, these findings implicate TRAF6 in Bortezomib-induced cell death and in the maintenance of myeloid malignancies, and reveal a novel mechanism of TRAF6 regulation through autophagic degradation.
