Updated epidemiological data and effectivenes in the daily clinical practice are needed in Multiple Myeloma (MM). Materials and Methods: Epidemiological retrospective, longitudinal, multicenter nation wide Spanish study of an historical cohort of patients with MM. Data from patients aged \u2265 18 years, with a MM Stage II or III, who received a treatment on a daily clinical practice (not in clinical trials) for MM in the September'03-August'05 time frame were collected. The study protocol was approved by an Ethics Committee in 2009. Data were collected in 37 Spanish Centres during a 6 months period. Stratified effectiveness and survival analysis were performed (age 3.5, calcium 10%, myelomatous cells 10%, induction treatment, dose delayed, full dose). Results: Data from 338 patients' files who fulfill all the study selection criteria were reviewed. Median age at diagnosed was 66 years. A 45% were aged less than 65 years, 34% 65\u201374 years and 21% \u2265 75. Male/female ratio: 50/50. ECOG performance status were available in 314 patients (93%) in whom the score was 0/1/2/3/4 in a proportion (%) of 25/25/25/20/5 respectively. Secretor MM was present in 95% of the patients. Bone lesions were present in 244 patients (73%). Plasmacytoma was evidenced in 51 (15%). Half of the patients were transplant candidates and it was performed in 128 (38%). Overall response rate were statistically different when using VBAD/VBMCP vs VAD and MP as induction regimens (86% vs 62% vs 50%, p=0,002). It must be noted that most novel treatments were not widely used by the time of the study. Median survival was 56.1 months. Survival rate at 3 years was 60.8%. Variables statistical significant at the discriminant analysis are showed at table 1. A stepwise Cox Model determine Hb level <10 g/dL, LDH <500 and transplant are prognostic factors for survival (table 2). Toxicity was manageable and no differences with those data already published were reported. Conclusion: These epidemiological data suggest the effectivemens of the treatment depends on its individualization based on patients' characteristics and in treatment adherence. LDH is a survival prognostic parameter in MM. No new safety issues appears, despite those already published. Table 1  . N . Median . 3 years survival (%) . p .
