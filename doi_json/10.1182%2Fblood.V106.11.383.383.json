    "abstract_text": "von Willebrand factor (VWF) binding to platelet glycoprotein (Gp) Ib-IX-V triggers platelet activation. Under conditions of pathologically elevated arterial wall shear stress, VWF-dependent platelet adhesion is coupled to aggregation and thrombus formation principally through GpIb\u03b1-induced signaling to \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3. To elucidate the mechanism of GpIb\u03b1 signaling to \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3, we have examined molecular interactions involving structural proteins that bind to the cytoplasmic domains of GpIb\u03b1 and \u03b2 3. In CHO cells co-expressing human GpIb-IX and \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3, the activation of \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3 as reported by monoclonal antibody PAC-1 binding is stimulated by ristocetin (1 mg/ml) + purified human VWF(5 \u03bcg/ml). When filamin binding to the cytoplasmic domain of GpIb\u03b1 is eliminated by deleting GpIb\u03b1 residues 560-570, PAC-1 binding is eliminated. When human platelets in reconstituted whole blood are treated with a peptide that interferes with filamin binding to GpIb\u03b1 (as reported in Blood  2003 ; 102 : 2122 \u20132129 ), shear-dependent (1500 sec \u22121 shear rate or 60 dynes/cm 2 shear stress) platelet deposition onto bovine type I collagen is inhibited. In washed resting platelets and platelets activated by 120 dynes/cm 2 shear stress, filamin co-immunoprecipitates with both GpIb\u03b1 and \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3; only its association with \u03b2 3 is eliminated by DNaseI (1 mg/ml), demonstrating that filamin binds indirectly to \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3 through other cytoskeletal elements. One such element is observed to be talin, which co-immunoprecipitates with filamin, \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3 and small amounts of GpIb\u03b1 in resting platelets. When platelets are sheared for two minutes at 120 dynes/cm 2 , talin\u2019s DNaseI-resistant association with filamin is decreased and its DNaseI-sensitive association with \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3 is increased. These changes are prevented when shear-dependent VWF binding to GpIb-IX-V is blocked by monoclonal antibody AK2. Shear-dependent VWF binding to GpIb-IX-V also results in the proteolysis of talin, which is considered to be one mechanism by which the N-terminal head domain of talin regulates \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3 activation. Shear-dependent talin proteolysis is not affected by blocking VWF binding to \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3 with a RGD peptide. These results demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of GpIb\u03b1 transduces signals to activate \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3 through its interactions with filamin. These signals depend only on VWF binding to GpIb-IX-V. Under pathologically elevated wall shear stress in vitro , the mechanism of signaling may be the release of talin by filamin, thus permitting the proteolysis of talin and enhancing talin\u2019s interaction with \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3.",
