    "abstract_text": "Background: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are associated with marked improvements in molecular response and survival compared with previous therapies for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP). We previously reported efficacy and safety of TKI at 12-month follow-up (Firwana et. al. JCO . 2014; 32(15_suppl): 7054). Here, we summarize the evidence of TKI efficacy and safety of TKI, comparing them directly and in-directly, in the mature follow-up for patients with newly diagnosed CP-CML. Methods: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating TKI in adults with newly diagnosed CP-CML. TKI (imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib) were included if used as an initial treatment. Studies on bosutinib were excluded as it is only approved in the US for the treatment of CP-CML after failure of initial therapy. Studies that included patients with accelerated- or blast-phase CML, intolerant or resistant patients to first-line treatment, those on IFN-\u03b1, older agents or stem cell transplantation were excluded. Main outcomes are efficacy, represented by major molecular response (MMR, \u2264 0.1% BCR-ABL IS ) and deeper molecular responses (MR 4.5 , \u2264 0.0032% IS ), survival, represented by overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS), and safety represented by medication discontinuation rate due to adverse events. Latest period of reporting outcome data were considered. As available trials provides direct comparison with imatinib, with no head-to-head trials to compare other TKI, we conducted a mixed treatment comparison (MTC) analysis which pools evidence from direct and indirect comparisons to facilitate simultaneous inference regarding all treatments. Bayesian mixed-treatment comparison method was used to rank TKI in terms of effectiveness. Results: Four landmark trials reported in 15 published articles and conference abstracts were identified involving 1647 patients with CP-CML. Follow-up times ranged from 3 months to 6 years. Table-1 depicts the results of MTC for imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib. MTC analysis demonstrated superiority of both nilotinib and dasatinib over imatinib in terms of efficacy and safety. Nilotinib ranked first in efficacy with better improvement in MMR and MR 4.5 at 48-month follow-up despite its different regimens, followed by dasatinib. Dasatinib has the highest medication discontinuation rate due to adverse events or drug-related toxicity. Among TKI, nilotinib was found to have the best survival profile; however, it was statistically nonsignificant. Conclusion: Both nilotinib and dasatinib are associated with significantly better efficacy and safety profiles compared to imatinib. At 48-month follow-up period, nilotinib ranked first to achieve MMR and MR 4.5 , with lower discontinuation rate due to adverse events. This analysis shows that new generation TKI are not only showing faster response, but also maintaining a more potent one through longer follow up period. It is important to note out that MTC is not a substitute for well conducted RCTs investigating direct comparisons.
