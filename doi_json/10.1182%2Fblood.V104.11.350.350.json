    "abstract_text": "Introduction: DF, a polydisperse oligonucleotide, has anti-thrombotic, anti-ischemic and thrombolytic properties, especially on microvasculature. Studies have suggested that DF modulates endothelial injury in VOD. Methods: A phase II randomized study of two doses, 25 mg/kg/d [arm A] or 40 mg/kg/d [arm B], was carried out in pts with severe VOD. Correlation with markers of vascular injury was undertaken. Endpoints included CR rate, toxicity and mortality at d+100 post SCT. VOD diagnosis was by Baltimore criteria and severity by \u226530% risk on the Bearman model or MOF. Abdominal ultrasound (US) was required prior to enrollment, repeated during therapy and at completion of treatment.Pts with \u2265 grade II GVHD were excluded. Treatment arms were stratified for age (<18y) and cyclophosphamide-based conditioning. Treatment was planned for \u226514d. Pts receiving \u22643d of therapy were inevaluable for response. CR was defined as a bilirubin <2 mg/dl and resolution of VOD-related MOF. Results: 102 pts have been treated; 51 pts on arm A and 51 pts on arm B: 87 pts underwent allo- and 15 auto-SCT. Median age was 33y (6 mos - 63y). At DF initiation, median bilirubin was 7.1 mg/dl; median wt gain 12%; ascites in 78%; RUQ pain in 65%; hepatomegaly in 71%; abnormal portal flow in 42%, and MOF in 97%. Median duration of therapy was 20d. There were no unexpected side effects and no treatment related deaths. In a subset of pts (n=14), central review of US was performed. Portal flow improved by wk 3 in pts with CR (n=8). Improvement was not seen in nonresponders (NR) (n=6), suggesting changes in portal flow may help predict outcome. Median values of markers of endothelial stress with DF treatment are summarized below. In pts with CR, median PAI-1 levels decreased and Protein C increased. Median NO declined regardless of response. Median thrombomodulin, tissue factor and TFPI increased in NR. CR was achieved in 50/93 pts (54%; 95% CI (43%,64%)), with survival to d+100 in 43/91 pts (47%; 95% CI (37%,58%)). No difference in outcome between the 2 dose arms was seen. An analysis using 38 controls matched for VOD severity confirmed a survival advantage (p=0.0004). Conclusion: US findings and trends in endothelial stress markers may help predict successful DF treatment. The CR rate (54%) and d+100 survival (47%) in this first prospective, randomized trial of DF in pts with severe VOD and MOF confirm the encouraging results of prior studies, and a case control analysis shows a highly significant survival benefit with DF treatment.  *p<0.05 .
