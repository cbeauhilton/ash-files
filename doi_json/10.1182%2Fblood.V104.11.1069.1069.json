    "abstract_text": "Recently we have shown that aberrations, ie microsatellite instability (MSI) and allelic imbalance (AI) in positively selected CD34+ cells from leukapheresis products collected during first complete remission of de novo AML following double induction or consolidation according to AMLCG protocol may be predictive for relapse-free survival (RFS). Here we present data of an extended patient population treated on the same protocol. We compared MSI/AI pattern in CD34+ cells (n=60) with the corresponding pattern in AML blasts at diagnosis (n=60) or at relapse (n=12), and compared the AI/MSI pattern in CD34+ cells with those observed in the corresponding unselected bone marrow aspirates in first CR (n=50). The following loci were tested: D7S486, D7S525, D8S559, TP53, D11S1356, D2S123, APC, MfD5. Minimal residual disease (MRD) in the tested remission specimen (FACS analysis) was 2 AI at any locus, AI at APC locus), GIN in CD34+ cells was predictive for unfavorable RFS (p=0.001). In conclusion, detection of AI/MSI in CD34+ cells of remission hematopoiesis represents a new important diagnostic tool to study biology of AML besides the detection of MRD. For the first time we could demonstrate, that the same AIs or MSIs detectable in CD34+ cells, but not in AML blasts at diagnosis may occur in AML blasts at relapse.",
