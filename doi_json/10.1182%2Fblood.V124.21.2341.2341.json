    "abstract_text": "Background: Leukemia cutis (LC) occurs in 10-30% of AML cases and may be a marker of poor prognosis. However, outside of monocytic AML (FAB M4/M5), no clinical or genetic predictors of LC are known. Recently, a number of somatic molecular mutations have been described in AML. Using amplicon-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a panel of recurrent, hematologic malignancy-associated mutations, we sought to determine potential molecular markers associated with the development of LC. Methods: A cohort of non-M3 AML patients treated at the University of Pennsylvania was identified in which NGS had been performed on either leukemic blasts obtained during clinical care or from the institutional tissue bank.Average read depth for 33 hematologic malignancy-associated genes was approximately 3000X, minimal depth was 250x, and reporting frequency cutoff for variants was 5%. Mutations were reported as pathogenic or variants of uncertain significance (VUS, further sub-classified internally as likely disease associated, VUS, or likely benign) based on the University\u2019s Center for Personalized Diagnostics (CPD) review of publically available data; only pathogenic or likely disease-associated mutations were included in this analysis. A database maintained by dermatopathology was reviewed to identify cases of leukemia cutis at any time during the disease course. Independent dermatopathology review was obtained for indeterminate cases. Association between presence of each of the 3 most common molecular mutations ( FLT3- ITD , DNMT3A, and NPM1 ) and development of LC was assessed by logistic regression, with adjustment for FAB M4/M5, as appropriate. The association between presence of a molecular mutation in different functional classes (tumor suppressors, activated signaling, chromatin modifiers, transcription factors, splicing machinery) and the development of LC was also assessed. Results: 279 adult patients with AML with known molecular genotype were identified. Molecular profile was determined from AML diagnosis in (243, 88%) with the remainder undergoing assessment after prior therapy (relapsed or refractory). 56% were male with median age of 60 years (range 18-87) and median WBC count at diagnosis of 22 K/uL (range 0.4 -388 K/uL; 17% \u2265100K/uL). The majority of patients had intermediate cytogenetic risk (12% favorable, 59% intermediate, 23% unfavorable, 6% unknown) and 41% of patients had FAB M4/M5 AML (9% unknown). The three most common mutations were NPM1 (29%), DNMT3A (25%), and FLT3 -ITD (23%). NPM1 mutations were enriched in patients with FAB M4/M5 AML (41% vs 23%, p=0.003). Leukemia cutis was present in 26 (9%) of patients. NPM1 mutant status was present in 14 of 26 cases of leukemia cutis (OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.40-7.20, p=0.006). No association was detected for LC and the presence of mutant FLT3 -ITD (OR 1.27, p=0.613), mutant DNMT3A (OR 1.7, p=0.224), or a mutation in any functional class of AML mutations (all p-values NS). The impact of NPM1 mutant status remained significant after adjustment for association with M4/M5 AML (OR 3.91, p=0.005). As the histologic subtype of AML might modify the association between NPM1 mutations and leukemia cutis, we next examined the impact of NPM1 mutant status on patients with FAB M4/M5 AML and non-M4/M5 AML. Among patients with M4/M5 AML, 10/12 (80%) patients with LC were NPM1 mutant compared to 32/91 (35%) without LC suggesting that the presence of mutated NPM1 was significantly associated with the development of LC (OR 9.22, p=0.006). Among patients with non-M4/M5 AML, 3/9 (33%) of patients with leukemia cutis were NPM1 mutant compared to 32/142 (22.5%) without LC indicating no association in the non-M4/M5 subgroup (OR 1.72, p=0.461). Interestingly, M4/M5 AML was not associated with LC in the NPM1 WT cohort (OR 0.65, p=0.6). Conclusion: Using NGS, we identify a novel association between NPM1 mutation status and the presence of leukemia cutis, particularly within monocytic AML. Confirmation of these observations in a larger dataset is planned. Our data suggest potential cellular effects of NPM1 mutation affecting homing of leukemic blasts to skin and support the World Health Organization\u2019s provisional classification of NPM1 -mutated AML as a distinct biologic entity.
