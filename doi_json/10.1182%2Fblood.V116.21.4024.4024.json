    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4024 Background: The hypomethylating agents 5-azacytidine (Vidaza) and 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (Decitabine, DAC) are active in different MDS subtypes. Compared to other response predictors to DAC, prior MDS duration has received only limited attention (1, 2), with conflicting results. Based on our finding that long duration of MDS prior to DAC treatment may be a novel factor linked to a better outcome (1), we now assess its value in the phase III trial 06011 (DAC versus BSC [3]). Immediate enrolment after diagnosis was allowed in that trial, median MDS duration prior to randomization thus only 3 months (mths). Methods: Comparison of progression-free (PFS), AML-free (AMLFS) and overall survival (OS) according to MDS duration >= vs. <3 mths in 233 patients (pts) with higher-risk MDS (median age 70 years) randomized to DAC (n=119) or BSC (n=114). Comparisons by long-rank test and multivariate analyses by Cox regression (Performance Status [PS], cytogenetics and IPSS high risk N/Y) were performed retrospectively: MDS duration had not yet been known as possible stratification factor at time of study initiation, and the trial thus not been powered to detect significant differences with regard to this discriminator. Results: A better prognosis of patients with MDS duration >=3 vs =3 mths (B vs D). In both arms (n=233), Mult. indicated that MDS duration (>=3 vs <3 mths) adjusted for treatment, PS, cytogenetics and IPSS group was an independent prognostic factor regarding PFS (HR=0.75, 95%CI 0.58\u20130.99), AMLFS (HR=0.68, 95%CI 0.51\u20130.90), and OS (HR=0.75, 95%CI 0.56\u20130.99). The tests for interaction treatment \u00d7 duration of MDS were not significant for 3 endpoints: PFS (p=0.38), AMLFS (p=0.90), OS (p=0.67). Conclusion: In intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS pts, long duration from MDS diagnosis to start of DAC or BSC appeared to be associated with a better outcome. This finding is in sharp contrast to the adverse prognostic impact of antecedent disease duration in patients who received intensive chemotherapy (4). It is supported by a similar analysis of pts with AML from MDS treated on the 00331 DAC phase II multicenter trial: those with longer MDS duration prior to DAC also had better outcome (5). Application of this discriminator in the evaluation also of other DAC schedules and MDS treatments therefore appears warranted. References: 1. Wijermans et al., Ann.
