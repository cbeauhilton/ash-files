    "abstract_text": "Background: In addition to NBEAL2, a single dominant-negative mutation in the GFIB1 gene has been associated with grey platelet syndrome but no association has been mentioned with dense granule deficiency. Here we describe a child with thrombocytopenia, alpha-delta granule deficiency, and a homozygous missense mutation in GFIB1 . Case Report: The patient is an 8y/o Hispanic male born to non-consanguineous parents. Prenatal and birth history were unremarkable. No family history of blood disorders or pediatric malignancies. The boy has 2 healthy older siblings, no dysmorphic features, and normal skin pigmentation and eye findings. Renal function and hearing are normal. At 3mo he was noted to have multiple spontaneous petechiae along with an isolated thrombocytopenia of 46K/uL. At 10 months, a bone marrow evaluation showed increased megakaryocytes suggestive of ITP. By 3years of age, he received three treatments of IVIG without an adequate response. His platelet counts have generally ranged between 30-50K/uL. With acute illnesses, they drop to 15-20K/uL. His bleeding symptoms have primarily been spontaneous bruising and petechiae as well as prolonged epistaxis. His symptoms have been generally controlled with anti-fibrinolytic agents alone. Platelet transfusions have been reserved for surgical procedures or significant bleeding symptoms. Further evaluations over the past 5 years have included peripheral smears, showing atypical large hypo-granular platelets, and two additional bone marrow aspirates, showing megakaryocytic hyperplasia with numerous osteoclast-like forms and occasional small mono-lobated megakaryocytes and evident emperipolesis. Anti-nuclear antibody testing and platelet direct and indirect antibody testing were negative. Platelet electron microscopy showed that platelets virtually contained no dense granules (0.05 dense granules/platelet, 200 platelets) and about 30-40% of the platelets had markedly decreased alpha granules. Some platelets had complex canalicular networks and membrane vacuoles. These features are consistent with an alpha-delta platelet storage-pool deficiency. A myeloid malignancy mutation panel, performed using next generation sequencing, detected no variants of known significance. Gene sequencing for MHY9 -related disorders as well as DNA breakage analysis for Fanconi's anemia were negative. However, DNA sequencing of the patient's sample revealed a homozygous missense mutation (c923 T>C; p.Leu308Pro) in the GFIB1 gene; each parent carried one copy of this change. Conclusion: GFIB1 , mapped to chromosome 9q34.13, encodes a transcriptional repressor that is important for megakaryopoiesis. It has been reported in patients with gray platelet syndrome; an inherited platelet disorder associated with thrombocytopenia and decreased alpha granules. This case points to an association of biallelic GFIB1 mutations with alpha-delta granule deficiency. This case underscores the importance of platelet esoteric testing and molecular analysis in the diagnosis of hereditary platelet disorders. As a targetable mutation in the future, this could revolutionize the early diagnosis and treatment of this rare platelet disorder. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
