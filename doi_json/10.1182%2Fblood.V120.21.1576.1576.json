    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1576 Background: While racial disparity has been documented in a number of cancers, the impact of race, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES) on FL outcomes is not well defined. Furthermore, the impact of modern therapeutics on these disparities has not been fully explored. Methods: We examined population-based FL overall survival (OS) data from SEER 13 (1993\u20132008) for race, sex, age, and socioeconomic status (SES) over two consecutive 8-year periods: Era 1 (1993\u20132000, n=7,409) and Era 2 (2001\u20132008, n=9,083). Results: We identified a total 16,492 FL patients (pts) (white (W): n=13,441 (81.5%); Hispanic (H): n=1,417 (8.5%); Asian/Pacific Islander (A/PI): n=887 (5.3%); and Black (B): n=747 (4.5%)). Median age at diagnosis differed significantly according to race: (in years, yrs) W: 62.1, H: 57.3, A/PI: 60.5, B: 56.6; P<0.01 for each race vs. W. For all pts, OS was superior in Era 2 vs. Era 1 (5-yr OS: 77% vs. 68%, respectively, P<0.0001). Further, OS was significantly improved for all age groups (<50, 50\u201359, 60\u201369, and 70\u201379 yrs) as well as for males (P=0.0019) and females (P<0.0001) across eras. Interestingly, females had superior OS compared with males in Era 1 (P=0.004), but not in Era 2 (P=0.83). We subsequently compared OS within and across races (see Table). All races, except A/PI, had improved 5-yr OS rates (age adjusted) from Era 1 to Era 2 (W: <0.001, H: 0.049, A/PI: 0.15, B: 0.003). Notably, A/PIs had the highest OS in Era 1, while H had the poorest OS in Era 2. These differences were more evident in males compared with females within each race. Finally, pts with higher SES had improved OS compared with low SES in both eras (P=0.02 in era 1 and <0.0001 in era 2), although OS was improved across eras within low and high SES populations (P<0.0001). Conclusions: Collectively, we identified improved OS in FL across eras, which was apparent for all ages, both sexes, and all races. However, racial disparities persist, including inferior OS for H and superior OS for A/PIs in the contemporary era. The disproportionate improvement in OS over eras and persistent inequality in outcomes based on race warrants continued examination. Table. OS across eras based on race  5-yr OS . P values .
