    "abstract_text": "Purpose: Arsenic Trioxide approved for treatment of relapsed or refractory APL to ATRA. We studied the effects of Arsenic Trioxide as first line treatment of new cases of APL and their follow up. Material and methods: we studied 73 new cases of APL diagnosed by morphologic criteria and confirmed by cytogenetic, RT-PCR for PML/RARA and/or FISH and followed patients for MRD by sensitive nested RT-PCR. Our patients were 30 males and 43 females with median age 30+/\u2212 12. Patients treated by infusion of 0.15mg/kg/d of Arsenic Trioxide to complete remission by morphologic criteria or till day +60. In patients who complete remission achieved, after 28 days rest, again we began Arsenic Trioxide 0.15mg/kg/d for 28 days as consolidation. Results: complete remission were achieved in 66 patients( 90.4%) and 7 early mortality. Median time to complete remission was 30+/\u22126.4 days. Most common cause of mortality was APL maturation syndrome ( 4 cases) Most common toxicities during induction phase were, APL maturation syndrome (10 cases), serositis(6 cases) and hepatotoxicity (19 cases). 63 cases(86.3%) are alive with a median follow up of 17+/\u221212.65 months. 14 relapses observed in our patients and complete remission achieved with re-treatment by Arsenic trioxide in 11 of them. Also we could control 3 fatal bleeding by infusion of activated factor 7(Novoseven O\u0300 ) which stopped hemorrhage . One year and two/three years survival of patients were 86% and 84%. Most common cause of death was APL maturation syndrome in 4 patients and relapse in 3 cases.Conclusion: Arsenic Trioxide is acceptable as first line treatment of APL and its result is comparable to ATRA with chemotherapy."
