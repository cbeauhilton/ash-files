    "abstract_text": "Nitric oxide (NO) is generated by serial reduction pathway of nitrate and nitrite or by activity of endogenous nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and modulates platelet function and hemostasis. We have shown by aggregometry and flow cytometric analysis of P-selectin that nitrite in the presence of erythrocytes inhibits platelet aggregation and activation after its reduction to NO at low oxygen tension [ PLoS One . 2012; 7 : e30380. 10.1371/journal.pone.0030380]. We then investigated how nitrite may affect overall clotting processes by regulating platelet function using thrombelastography (TEG), a method used to assess platelet function, fibrin clot formation, and fibrinolysis in blood and/or plasma. We measured the effect of NO donors and nitrite on three TEG parameters, reaction time (R, time to initial fibrin formation), \u03b1 angle (velocity of clot growth) and maximum amplitude (MA, clot strength), in healthy volunteers. The NO donor (DEANONOate) inhibited all three TEG parameters in response to two independent platelet activators (ADP and AA), in platelet rich plasma (PRP) or whole blood diluted with plasma to yield 20% hematocrit (Hct) to model blood in the microcirculation in vivo . At DEANONOate concentrations ranging from 0-1 \u03bcM, R values were progressively prolonged from 1.9 to 3.6 (p=0.008), \u03b1 angle was decreased from 17.8 to 9.5 (p=0.01) and maximum clot amplitude was reduced from 9.0 to 4.4 (p=0.001) in 20% Hct with ADP stimulation. In contrast, nitrite did not affect clotting parameters in PRP, but exhibited moderate inhibitory effects in 20% Hct at concentrations from 0-10 \u03bcM; R values were slightly prolonged from 1.6 to 2.7 (p=0.12), \u03b1 angle was decreased from 21.8 to 12.8 (p=0.07) and maximum clot amplitude was reduced from 11.0 to 5.0 (p=0.02). This inhibitory effect of nitrite on clotting was greatly enhanced under hypoxic conditions (blood pO 2 46.5\u00b111.6 mmHg); R values from 1.4 to 4.0 (p=0.003), \u03b1 angle from 21.7 to 7.8 (p=0.002), and maximum clot amplitude from 10.0 to 3.4 (p=0.0003). These results suggest that the nitrite effect may be greatest in the microcirculation and be important in differences between arterial and venous clotting. In conclusion, our results show TEG parameters indicate NO inhibition of platelet-mediated blood clotting and that the physiological effect of factors which determine NO bioavailability, such as reduction of blood and tissue nitrite, could be used to predict hemostasis.
