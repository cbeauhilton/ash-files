    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3468 Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) participate in the generation of the microenvironmental bone marrow niche which protects normal and leukemic stem cells from injuries, including chemotherapy. MSC produce numerous factors that aid in this function; however, little is known about how leukemic cells affect MSC. In this study, paired murine AML cells, MLL/ENL/FIT3-ITD/p53 \u2212/\u2212 and MLL/ENL/FIT3-ITD/p53 wt , originally derived from C57BL/6 mice (Zuber et al. Genes & Dev. 2009 ), were co-cultured with MSC from the same strain. After 48 hrs, MSC were isolated by FACS sorting using CD45 \u2212 /PDGFr + as markers. Total RNA was profiled on Illumina WG6 mouse whole-genome bead arrays by standard procedures. The significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) method identified 429 differentially-expressed genes (DEG) whose expression in MSC differed significantly (false discovery rate, 10%) in co-cultures with p53 \u2212/\u2212 (C78) vs. p53 wt (C147) leukemic cells. Differences in these DEG were highly consistent in replicates ( Figure 1 ). The results demonstrate that: 1) p53 status (p53 \u2212/\u2212 vs. p53 wt ) of AML cells affects GEP patterns in co-cultured MSC. Comparison of the GEP in MSC co-cultured with p53 \u2212/\u2212 (78) or p53 wt (147) ( Fig 1 ) identified the following 5 genes that showed the most significant differences (up- or down-regulated): up-regulated: WNT16, WNT5, IGFBp5, GCNT1, ATP1B1; down-regulated: NOS2, DCN, CCL7, CCL2, CAR9, CCL4. These were selected for qPCR validation, and the results confirmed the array data. In addition, immunohistochemical staining showed that WNT16 was up-regulated in MSC co-cultured with p53 wt leukemic cells. In addition, CXCL5 was found up-regulated in MSC co-cultured with p53 \u2212/\u2212 leukemic cells. These results were consistent with the GEP data. 2) Leukemic cells alter MSC Signaling proteins in vitro: Western blotting showed that Stat3, Akt, PTEN, CXCL5 and HIF-1\u03b1 were up- regulated in MSC co-cultured with p53 \u2212/\u2212 leukemic cells as compared to p53 wt leukemic cells (48 hrs). Additional analyses showed that the downstream targets of HIF-1\u03b1, VEGFa and VEGFc, but not VEGFb, were up-regulated. Taken together, these results suggest that 1) leukemic cells with different p53 genetic background co-cultured with normal MSC have profoundly differential effects on GEP of normal MSC; 2) MSC co-cultured with p53 \u2212/\u2212 leukemic cells resulted in increased levels of onco-proteins such as Akt and HIF-1\u03b1 when compared to MSC co-cultured with p53 wt leukemic cells. Results suggest, for the first time, that the genetics of leukemic cells determines gene expression in co-cultured MSC. In vivo experiments are in progress to provide in vivo evidence for the existence of a novel model of leukemia-stroma interactions where the genetics of the tumor cell impacts stromal cell biology.
