    "abstract_text": "Background: A CLSG pilot rx\u2019d 140 pts.with Response Adapted Rx(RA) with Idarubicin 12 mg/m 2 d1-3 & Ara-C 200 mg/m2 d1-7(IDAC);followed by IDAC II, then Mitoxantrone10 mg/m 2 &VP-16 100 mg/m 2 d1-5(NOVE), if in CR after IDAC, & NOVE x2 if they had persistent blasts @ d14 or @ recovery. CR rate was 74% in pts age15\u201380.DFS and OS were favourable @ 20 mos & 47 mos in pts \u2264 60. A CALGB study demonstrated the advantage of consolidation with high dose Ara-C(HDAC).We chose to compare HDAC with RA. Methods: All pts with AML, age15\u201380, with a performance of 0\u20132,were included except those with a hx of MDS>3 mos,bili>85 mmol/l, creatinine>220 mmol/l, hx of chemoRx or radiation Rx for another malignancy,CML, ejection fraction60. Dosage adjustments were made to VP-16 according to \u2191 AST, to Idarubicin according to\u2191 bilirubin, and to HDAC according to \u2191 ALP and/or \u2191 creatinine. Pts with M3 were to be treated at least 45 days with ATRA. Pts were stratified according to age and # of inductions required to achieve CR and were followed until death, relapse, or BMT. Pts were followed for quality of life using both the SF-36 and the FLIC surveys which pts completed at baseline,1,4 and 12 mos post discharge from consolidation. Data went through annual analyses by an independent data monitoring committee comprised of a non-blinded statistician, a hematologist, and a an oncologist not participating in the study who were blinded to treatment allocation. Their analysis was done using group sequential design with early stopping boundaries. Results: The comparison was made between the RA approach (Arms A+D) vs. consolidation with HDAC (Arms B+C). Analysis was done on an intent-to-treat basis. 503 patients were recruited into the study from 5/96 until 12/01, of whom 461 were assessable. 201 age \u2264 60 and 95 age > 60 were randomized with a median time since randomization of 65.7 mos.Median DFS in RA pts > 60 was 20 mos vs. 13.3 mos in the HDAC arm (p=.15). The overall DFS hazard ratio was 0.72 (0.47, 1.13), p=0.153. For those RA pts > 60 and disease free at 6 mos, the median DFS was 27.3 mos vs. 10.2 mos in the HDAC arm with the hazard ratio of 0.57 (0.33, 1.02), p=0.056. Median DFS in pts \u2264 60 was 32 mos in pts randomized to RA and was 22.8 mos in the HDAC arm. Median OS in pts \u2264 60 has not yet been reached in pts randomized to RA and was 60.2 mos in the HDAC arm. In the RA pts > 60 the median OS was 21.1 mos vs. 19 mos in the HDAC arm. Notably, there is a trend in 117 pts \u2264 60 undergoing BMT to have lower mortality if treated with RA 21 (41.2%), rather than with HDAC 37 (56.1%), p=0.11. Conclusion: Although this study was not sufficiently powered to detect a statistically significant difference at the 0.05 level it suggests that RA therapy is advantageous over HDAC consolidation therapy, particularly for pts > 60 and for those who may get a BMT.",
