    "abstract_text": "Integrin mechanotransduction is a ubiquitous biological process. Mechanical forces are transduced by an integrin\u2019s ligand-bound extracellular domain through its \u03b2 subunit\u2019s cytoplasmic domain connected to the cytoskeleton. This often culminates in the activation of tyrosine kinases directing cell responses. The delicate balance between hemostasis and thrombosis requires exquisitely fine-tuned integrin function, and balance is maintained in vivo despite that the major platelet integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is continuously subjected to frictional or shearing forces generated by laminar blood flow. To test the hypothesis that platelet function is regulated by the direct effects of mechanical forces on \u03b1IIb\u03b23, we examined \u03b1IIb\u03b23/cytoskeletal interactions in human platelets exposed to shear stress in a cone-plate viscometer. We observed that \u03b1-actinin, myosin heavy chain and Syk co-immunoprecipitate with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in resting platelets, and that 120 dynes/cm 2 shear stress leads to their disassociation from \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Shear-induced disassociation of \u03b1-actinin and myosin heavy chain from the \u03b23 tail is unaffected by blocking VWF binding to GpIb-IX-V but abolished by blocking VWF binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Syk\u2019s disassociation from \u03b23 is inhibited when VWF binding to either GpIb-IX-V or \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is blocked. Shear stress-induced phosphorylation of SLP-76 and its association with tyrosine phosphorylated SLAP-130 are inhibited by blocking ligand binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 but not by blocking ligand binding to GpIb-IX-V. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing human \u03b1IIb\u03b23 demonstrate calcium and shear-dependent (1 and 10 dynes/cm 2 ) attachment to glass cover slips coated with 20 \u03bcg/ml VWF. CHO cells expressing \u03b1IIb\u03b23 with \u03b23 truncated of its cytoskeletal binding domains at C-terminal residue 716 demonstrate decreased VWF-dependent adhesion and cohesion in response to 1 dyne/cm 2 shear stress. These results support the hypothesis that shear stress directly modulates \u03b1IIb\u03b23 function, and suggest that shear-induced \u03b1IIb\u03b23-mediated signaling regulates platelet aggregation by directing the release of \u03b1-actinin and myosin heavy chain from the \u03b23 tail.",
