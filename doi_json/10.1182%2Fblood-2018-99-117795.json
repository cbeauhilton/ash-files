    "abstract_text": "Objective: The long-term efficacy (June 2001 - May 2018) of newly diagnosed APL patients (pts) treated with either As 4 S 4 or As 2 O 3 in combination of all-trans retinoid acid (ATRA), and anthracycline-based chemotherapy in Lu Dao-Pei Hospital is analyzed. Methods: Firstly, 8 years from June 2001 to December 2009, a total of 88 newly diagnosed with APL patients were divided into two groups, who were treated with a protocol of either oral(po) As 4 S 4 (n=42) or intravenous (IV) arsenic trioxide (ATO) (n=46) combined with ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Secondly, 17 years from June 2001 till June 2018, 63 cases of newly diagnosed with APL patients were all treated with the protocol of oral As 4 S 4 based triple-agents treatment. The oral As 4 S 4 and IV ATO treatment protocols were as follows. In the first month of induction, either As4S4 60mg/kg/day po or ATO 0.15mg / kg IV \u00d7 30 days in combination with ATRA 45mg / m2/day po \u00d7 30 days and NVT1.5-3mg / kg IV \u00d7 5-7 days were given. This was followed by consolidation chemotherapy 3 to 5 cycles after CR, consistence with : \u2460 IDA12mg/m2 IV\u00d73d; \u2461 Aar-C 75mg/m2 IV\u00d77d + ACLA 14mg/m2\u00d77d; \u2462 NVT 6mg/kg\u00d73d; \u2463 Ara-C 75mg/m2\u00d77d + HHT 1.4mg/m2\u00d77d; \u2464MD-Ara-C (the fifth was only given to pts with WBC>10\u00d710 9 /L before treatment). After which, maintenance treatment was given either with As 4 S 4 60mg/kg po or ATO 0.15mg / kg IV \u00d715d every 30 days. Both groups were also given ATRA 45mg/m2 po\u00d715d every 30 days. The interval was increased by more than 15 days every half year. The total treatment duration lasted 3-4 years. Results: (1) All of the two groups who were treated with a protocol of either oral As 4 S 4 (n=42) or IV arsenic trioxide (ATO) (n=46) from 2001 to 2009 reached 100% of molecular complete remission (MCR). The 8-year estimated disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 100% in oral As 4 S 4 group with a median follow-up of 66 (15-109) months(mos). In ATO group, the DFS rate was 87.1% with a median follow-up of 42 (14-102) mos. The difference of the DFS rate between both groups was statistically significant (p=0.028, Log-Rank test). (2) In view of the outstanding DFS result in oral As 4 S 4 group, after 2009, another 21 APL patients were treated with the protocol of oral As 4 S 4 . So in total 63 patients treated with the protocol of oral As 4 S 4 , there were 9 children and 54 adults, 24 cases with high WBC>10\u00d710 9 /L before treatment, 11 cases of additional chromosomal abnormalities other than t(15;17), 9 cases of central nervous system leukemia(CNSL), and 2 cases of FLT3-ITD positive in the 22 cases with FLT3 results. All the patients attained hematological complete remission (HCR) after induction therapy without treatment-related death and achieved MCR. The median duration of MCR time was 2 (1-7) mos. The long-term overall survival (OS) rate was 98.4%(Fig1) (one died from endometrial carcinoma), and DFS rate was 100%(Fig2) (With 2 cases relapsed, respectively because of hematological and CNS, of which the current DFS time were 40mos and 30mos after CR again). The median follow-up time was 124 (21-198) mos. Conclusions: APL patients treated with either oral As 4 S 4 or IV As 2 O 3 combined with ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy can obtain 100% MCR and high long-term DFS. Compared with IV ATO, patients in oral As 4 S 4 group achieved significantly better efficacy, with a 17-year DFS of 100%. Moreover, oral As 4 S 4 is easy to give.
