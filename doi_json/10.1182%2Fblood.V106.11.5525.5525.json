    "abstract_text": "Background: Viral vectors based on the Edmonston strain of measles virus (MV-Edm) selectively destroy all tumor cell lines tested in vitro. The oncolytic activity of the virus is enhanced by expression of the thyroidal sodium iodide symporter (MV-NIS) that allows selective 131 I uptake by infected tumor cells and eliminates myeloma tumor xenografts that are resistant to the parent virus. MV-NIS is being considered for therapy of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Advanced myeloma is associated with significant immunosuppression with the potential risk of uncontrolled virus proliferation. The number of agents with activity against MV is limited. Low energy (Auger) electrons have a short path length and selectively damage cells in which the isotope decays. Thus, we hypothesized that the Auger electron emitting isotope 125 I, selectively taken up by cells expressing NIS, can be used to control viral proliferation. Methods: A replication competent MV that expressed both a soluble form of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and NIS (MV-NICE) was rescued and characterized. Cells were infected with MV-NICE or control vectors and exposed to 125 I with appropriate controls. CEA expression and viral titers were determined at different time points. The role of free radical generation on virus replication was explored. In vivo control of MV-NICE replication with 125 I was attempted. Results: MV-NICE replication in vitro is inhibited by the selective uptake of 125 I by cells expressing NIS. Extracellular decay of the isotope has no effect on virus proliferation. Auger electron damage is in part mediated by free radicals and abrogated by glutathione. In myeloma xenografts, control of MV-NICE with 125 I was not possible under the conditions of the experiment. Conclusion: MV-NICE does not replicate faster in the presence of radiation under our experimental conditions. Auger electron emitting isotopes effectively stop propagation of MV vectors expressing NIS in vitro . Additional work is necessary to translate these observations in vivo .",
