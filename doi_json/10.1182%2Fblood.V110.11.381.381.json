    "abstract_text": "Introduction Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) differs not only in the form of histology and reactive background but also in the phenotypes of the tumor cells. Although tumor cells from both HL subtypes are originated from the germinal center (GC) B cell, gene expression studies show that lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells from NLPHL resembles normal B cells while Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cells (H/RS) from cHL demonstrate a loss of B cell phenotype and have significant overlap with primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBL). Recently, a new class of small RNAs, namely the micro-RNAs (miRNAs), has been identified. It is now known that at the post-transcriptional level, miRNAs negatively regulate gene expression in a sequence specific manner. Unique miRNAs expression patterns have been reported in various tissue types and also during a wide range of physiological states, such as cell proliferation, development, differentiation, apoptosis and hypoxia. As miRNAs play important roles in many cellular processes, it is proposed that there is a link between aberrant miRNA expression and loss of B cell phenotype in cHL. Methods In this study, miRNA profiles from cell lines of various B cell lymphoma subtypes were examined by qRT-PCR. Also, several B cell subsets were sorted from tonsil by FACS and the miRNA profiles studied by qRT-PCR. Some of the miRNAs are analyzed by in situ hybridization (ISH) in both HL tissue and tonsil samples. Results The miRNA profiling data indicated that cHL cell lines cluster together with PMBL while DEV, an NLPHL cell line, clusters together with CB. Upon validation of differentially expressed miRNAs on a cell line panel of 33 cell lines by monoplex qRT-PCR, 5/8 miRNAs identified as differentially expressed between cHL and GC B cells, were confirmed. Four out of six miRNAs differentially expressed between cHL and PMBL, were also confirmed as being differentially expressed in a larger cell panel. A high degree of overlap was observed between the most abundantly expressed miRNAs in the four HL cell lines. Expression of these miRNAs in HRS cells was verified by ISH in HL tissue samples. miRNA profiles of naive, GC and memory B cells display unique patterns. The overall miRNA expression levels were much lower than observed in the cell lines. Results of miRNA ISH in tonsil tissue demonstrated a specific staining pattern for each miRNA. These data indicate that miRNAs are particularly important for subsets of lymphocytes. Conclusion Several miRNAs that are expressed specifically in Hodgkin lymphoma have been identified. However, the effect of the aberrant expressions of these miRNAs in HL is yet to be elucidated, as the targets of these miRNAs remain unknown.",
