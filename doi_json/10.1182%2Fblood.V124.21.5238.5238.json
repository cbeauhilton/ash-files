    "abstract_text": "Wogonin, a plant-derived flavone, has been shown to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is associated with multiple myeloma (MM) progression. However, the mechanisms that Wogonin inhibits angiogenesis in MM microenvironment are not well known. In this study, we investigated Wogonin inhibited tumor angiogenesis that correlated with the inhibition the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in MM cells. The c-Myc/Hif-1\u03b1\u2013dependent pathway was essential to regulate MM cell-mediated angiogenesis and contributed to tumor growth. Wogonin inhibited c-Myc activation and down-regulated the expression of c-Myc and Hif-1\u03b1. Functionally, based on transient knockdowns and overexpression, our data delineate Wogonin inhibited VEGF production and secretion mediating tumor angiogenesis via c-Myc/Hif-1\u03b1\u2013dependent pathway. Our data, therefore, identify Wogonin as a novel anti-angiogenesis compound to inhibit tumor promotion in MM. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
