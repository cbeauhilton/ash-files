    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3608 Poster Board III-544 Erythropoietin (EPO) is essential during both ontogeny and the course of erythropoiesis. In primitive (yolk sac) erythropoiesis, however, the role of EPO is not fully understood. Elucidation of such role in primitive erythropoiesis would be very helpful for the development of ex vivo red blood cell expansion system from embryonic stem (ES) cells. Recently, we reported the establishment of the ex vivo induction of hematopoietic stem cells from common marmoset ES cells using lentiviral-Tal1/Scl gene transfer in the absence of any stromal cells (Stem Cells 24: 2014-2022, 2006). This method should also be applicable to both of human ES cells and induced pluripotential stem (iPS) cells, but the efficiency will be very critical for its clinical application. In the present study, we proceed further to find out unknown factors which accelerate ex vivo proliferation and differentiation of erythroid cells, constructed the human fetal liver cDNA expression lentiviral library (Mol Cell Biochem 319: 181-187, 2008) and screened for cDNAs which confer EPO independency to an EPO-dependent cell line, UT-7/Epo ( Blood 82: 456-464, 1993). Among twenty-two candidate genes cloned after screening of 6\u00d710 \u2227 5 cDNA, we particularly focused on two full-length genes, ribosomal protein L11 (RPL11) and retinol dehydrogenase 11 (RDH11). Two candidate gene-transduced-UT-7/Epo cells, respectively named LV-RPL11 and LV-RDH11, showed complete EPO-independent survival and proliferation, increased expression of fetal \u03b3-globin, and decreased expression of adult \u03b2-globin compared with parental UT-7/Epo cells in the presence of EPO. Cell cycle and apoptosis analyses showed decreased apoptotic cell death and increased S/G2/M cells in LV-RPL11 and LV-RDH11 cells compared with UT-7/Epo cells in the absence of Epo. Moreover, STAT5 phosphorylation and upregulation of its target genes, c-Myc, cyclin D and Pim, were observed in LV-RPL11, LV-RDH11 cells in the absence of EPO. In conclusion, the findings suggest that RPL11 and RDH11 play a role in EPO-independent erythropoiesis and might be applicable to ex vivo expansion of red blood cells from ES/iPS cells.
