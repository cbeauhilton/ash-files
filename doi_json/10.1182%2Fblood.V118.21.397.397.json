    "abstract_text": "Abstract 397 Upon antigenic stimulation of B cells, germinal centers (GCs) are formed where somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) genes serve to diversify the immune response. SHM and CSR are initiated by the enzyme activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) through the conversion of C/G base pairs to U-G mismatches. These mismatches are processed by UNG-dependent base excision repair (BER) and MSH2-dependent mismatch repair (MMR) pathways to yield mutations (for SHM) and DNA strand lesions (for CSR). Despite this essential role in immune diversification, the intrinsic activity of AID as a DNA mutator poses a threat to genomic integrity. Indeed, aberrant targeting of AID activity is associated with translocations and point mutations of proto-oncogenes associated with B cell malignancies. A specific dependence on AID in the pathogenesis of lymphomas of GC B cell origin is exemplified in I\u03bc-Bcl6 knock-in mice. These mice develop a diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBL) that resembles the human disease but are protected from development of this lymphoma when crossed onto an Aid-deficient background. To investigate the role of Aid-associated DNA repair in the pathogenesis of this disease, we crossed I\u03bc-Bcl6 mice onto a background deficient in BER ( Ung \u2212/\u2212 ) and MMR ( Msh2 \u2212/\u2212 ). Young healthy I\u03bc-Bcl6 and I\u03bc-Bcl6 Ung \u2212/\u2212 Msh2 \u2212/\u2212 mice displayed a normal number and distribution of B cells and normal architecture of lymphoid organs. Five of 28 I\u03bc-Bcl6 mice (17.9%) became sick starting at \u223c12 months of age. Historically, median survival in these mice has not been reached and \u223c80% survive to 15 months. In contrast, 21 of 28 I\u03bc-Bcl6 Ung \u2212/\u2212 Msh2 \u2212/\u2212 mice (75%) developed disease with an onset of \u223c3 months and had a median survival of 6.2 months (p<0.0001). All 5 of the I\u03bc-Bcl6 mice and the majority of I\u03bc-Bcl6 Ung \u2212/\u2212 Msh2 \u2212/\u2212 mice developed B cell lymphoma with splenic involvement and variable nodal involvement. Five of the I\u03bc-Bcl6 Ung \u2212/\u2212 Msh2 \u2212/\u2212 mice developed other cancers (3 T cell lymphomas, 1 pre-B cell lymphoma and 1 colon adenocarcinoma). Tumors from both genotypes expressed a mature B cell phenotype (B220+ IgM+ Ig\u03ba+ CD138-) and morphology revealed loss of normal lymphoid architecture with infiltration by lymphoid blasts. Additional staining demonstrated expression of at least one GC marker (Fas, GL7 and/or PNA). Similar to I\u03bc-Bcl6 mice, while many of the I\u03bc-Bcl6 Ung \u2212/\u2212 Msh2 \u2212/\u2212 tumors had clonal mutated Ig heavy chain gene variable regions, two of the tumors were identified as oligoclonal, suggesting a preceding lymphoproliferative stage. In the absence of Ung and Msh2, Aid-generated U-G mismatches are not recognized and are simply replicated, causing only C/G to T/A transition mutations and no strand lesions. Thus, as expected, all Ig mutations in I\u03bc-Bcl6 Ung \u2212/\u2212 Msh2 \u2212/\u2212 mice were C/G to T/A transitions. Lymphomas from I\u03bc-Bcl6 mice have been found to harbor numerous chromosome translocations and aneuploidies. Although additional analyses are underway, spectral karyotyping of 3 I\u03bc-Bcl6 Ung \u2212/\u2212 Msh2 \u2212/\u2212 tumors revealed 2 with normal cytogenetics and 1 with a 40\u201341,XX,t(2;17),+15,+19. Surprisingly, sequence analysis of several known Aid target genes ( cMyc , Pim1 , RhoH , Pax5 , Cd79a , Fas , H2ax and OcaB ) in tumors from 3 I\u03bc-Bcl6 Ung \u2212/\u2212 Msh2 \u2212/\u2212 mice did not identify any clonal mutations. However, non-clonal C/T to T/A transition mutations in cMyc were present at a frequency of 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , suggestive of ongoing Aid activity. The presence of Aid activity but absence of off-target Aid-mediated clonal SHM suggests that either other genes are targeted by Aid or that Aid has a secondary role in lymphomagenesis such as epigenetic reprogramming, as has been shown in iPS cells. Nonetheless, the incidence of Aid-dependent lymphomagenesis in the absence of Aid-associated DNA repair is significantly increased and the latency is greatly shortened. Altogether, this data suggests that Aid-associated BER and MMR pathways afford a protective effect against the development of Aid-dependent GC B cell lymphomas such as DLBL. To investigate the role of the individual Aid-associated DNA repair pathways, we have also generated I\u03bc-Bcl6 Ung \u2212/\u2212 and I\u03bc-Bcl6 Msh2 \u2212/\u2212 single knockout mice. These studies are ongoing but preliminary results suggest that while the effect of Ung and Msh2 deficiency on lymphomagenesis may be synergistic, Msh2 might play a more critical role in preventing Aid-mediated genomic instability.
