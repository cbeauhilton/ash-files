    "abstract_text": "Background Sickle cell trait (SCT) affects approximately 8% of African Americans and these individuals are at risk of having children with SCT and sickle cell disease (SCD). Universal newborn screening in the United States detects SCT, but only 16% of individuals of childbearing age with SCT know their status. This is because SCT is not reliably recorded in medical records and SCT may not be consistently or effectively communicated to caregivers. Interventions that increase caregivers' SCT knowledge are important so that individuals with SCT can make informed decisions about their reproductive health. Objectives The objectives of this study were to determine if in-person SCT education with a trained educator improved caregivers' SCT knowledge and to assess caregivers' satisfaction with their SCT education. Methods Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH) is a SCT referral center in Columbus, OH. At NCH, it is standard that caregivers of infants with SCT who are referred by their primary care providers receive in-person SCT education using visual aids from an educator who has completed a hemoglobinopathy counselor training course . From August 2015-July 2016, we performed a prospective, cross-sectional study of English-speaking caregivers of infants with hemoglobin S-trait who presented for education. Caregivers were excluded if they had SCD or previously received SCT education at NCH. Prior to receiving education, subjects electronically reported their demographic information and completed a health literacy assessment using the Newest Vital Sign (NVS, range 0-6) and an 8-question (true/false, multiple choice) pilot-tested, SCT knowledge assessment (SCTKA) that included items from a published SCT knowledge study and items routinely discussed during NCH SCT education. Lower NVS scores suggest a higher likelihood of limited health literacy. Caregivers with SCTKA scores <75% were considered to have low knowledge. Immediately after receiving education, caregivers repeated the SCTKA and provided feedback about the session. Assessments were not available to the educator during the session. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was used to compare SCTKA scores pre- and post-education. Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare NVS and pre-SCTKA scores between those with high and low SCT knowledge after education. Results We recruited 114/374 eligible caregivers who presented during the study period and 113 completed the study. Subjects were mostly female (77%), 18-39 years of age (95.6%), parents or step parents (95.6%) of the child, and some (34.8%) reported that they had SCT. Many caregivers (52.2%) had NVS scores <4, but most (94.7%) reported the education was easy to understand, their questions were answered (99.1%), and they do intend to inform their child of their SCT status (99.1%). Caregivers' median pre-education SCTKA score significantly improved from 62.5% (IQR=25%) to 87.5% (IQR=12.5%) with education (p <0.0001). Only 38.1% of caregivers had high SCT knowledge pre-education but most (90.3%) achieved high knowledge with education. Caregivers with low SCT knowledge after education had significantly lower NVS scores (median=1, p=0.0286) and baseline SCTKA scores (median=50%, p=0.0032) compared to those with high SCT knowledge after education (NVS=3.5, baseline SCTKA median=62.5%). Discussion Our study suggests that caregivers' baseline SCT knowledge is low and improves with in-person education. Despite overall caregiver satisfaction and intensive in-person education from a trained educator, approximately 10% did not achieve high SCT knowledge and our results show that these caregivers may have lower baseline SCT knowledge and health literacy. Assessing caregivers' health literacy and SCT knowledge prior to education may be useful to allow educators to modify their education to meet the needs of those with limited health literacy and SCT knowledge. Future studies need to determine if tailored education results in high SCT knowledge among all caregivers, if caregivers' SCT knowledge is sustained, and if high caregiver knowledge results in more individuals with SCT knowing their status and using this knowledge to inform their reproductive decision-making.
