    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2134 Introduction: L-asparaginase is a vital component of multi-agent chemotherapy for children and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In the United States, there are 2 asparaginase preparations approved by the Food and Drug Administration, native E. coli (Elspar\u00ae) and PEG-asparaginase (Oncaspar\u00ae). PEG-asparaginase is the most commonly utilized asparaginase product due to its longer half-life and decreased immunogenicity. However, the incidence of clinical allergy to PEG-asparaginase approaches 20%, with repeated administration. Due to cross reactivity with native E. coli asparaginase, there is no FDA-approved preparation available for patients who develop clinical allergy to PEG-asparaginase. A third preparation, Erwinia asparaginase (Erwinase\u00ae), derived from Erwinia chrysanthemi , is not commercially available in the United States. The optimal dosing of Erwinase\u00ae necessary to obtain nadir asparaginase activity > 0.1 IU/mL similar to that obtained after conventional dosing of PEG-asparaginase is unknown. Patients and Methods: We hypothesized that substitution of Erwinase\u00ae 25,000 IU/m 2 \u00d7 6 doses intramuscularly (IM) on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule in children and young adults with ALL would provide a 48 hour nadir serum asparaginase activity \u2265 0.1 IU/mL, and effectively deplete plasma asparagine, a surrogate marker of asparaginase activity. Eligible patients on COG study AALL07P2 were >1 to <30 years of age, concurrently enrolled on a frontline COG ALL treatment study, and had documented \u2265 grade 2 allergy (NCI Common Terminology Criteria 3.0) to PEG-asparaginase. Results: A total of 55 eligible/evaluable patients were enrolled from February 2008 to April 2010. Blood samples were obtained at scheduled time points during Erwinase\u00ae therapy and assayed for serum asparaginase activity and asparagine concentration in plasma. Nadir serum asparaginase activity \u2265 0.1 IU/mL was achieved in 49/53 patients (92.5%) at 48 hours after dosing and in 46/52 patients (88.5%) at 72 hours after dosing. Plasma asparagine was significantly depleted (<1.0 \u03bcM) in all 49 patients for whom samples were satisfactorily obtained. Grade 2\u20133 allergic reaction and grade 1\u20132 hyperglycemia related to Erwinase\u00ae were reported in 5 and 3 patients, respectively. There were no reports of hemorrhage, thrombosis, pancreatitis, or death. Conclusion: Erwinase\u00ae as administered using the AALL07P2 regimen was well tolerated and achieved nadir serum asparaginase activity at both 48 and 72 hours after dosing that was similar to that achieved with PEG-asparaginase. We conclude that following allergy to PEG-asparaginase, Erwinase\u00ae 25,000 IU/m 2 \u00d7 6 doses IM on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule can be substituted for a single dose of PEG-asparaginase.
