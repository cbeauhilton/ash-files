    "abstract_text": "The regulation of hematopoiesis in non-mammalian vertebrates is poorly understood. This is partly because the structures and effects of most hematopoietic regulators have not been identified. As a first step towards studies on the key ingredient of hematopoietic regulation among phyla as well as the diversity of organisms, we have focused on amphibian hematopoiesis. In this study, a cDNA sharing the highest degree of homology with mammalian erythropoietin (EPO) receptors, named xeEPOR tentatively, was cloned from cDNA library of Xenopus immature erythrocytes. The identities of the deduced entire amino acid sequence to human and murine EPO receptors were 24% and 25%, respectively; whereas transmembrane region and motifs of WSXWS and Box1/2 domains were found in the molecule. The northern analysis revealed that two types of xeEPOR RNAs were expressed in normal peripheral blood cells. In addition, by in situ hybridization and immunostaining with monoclonal antibodies raised against the extracellular domain of xeEPOR (soluble xeEPOR), immature basophilic erythrocytes expressing xeEPOR appeared in peripheral blood of phenylhydrazine-treated adult Xenopus . The fulllength xeEPOR cDNA was introduced into murine FDC/P2 cells and the signaling for the cellular proliferation and differentiation was examined in the presence of serum derived from anemic Xenopus as a stimulator. To further understanding the contribution of the xeEPOR gene expression to primitive and definitive hematopoiesis on Xenopus development, whole mount in situ hybridization was performed. As the binding motif of GATA-1, the hematopoietic specific transcription factor, was located at \u221224 to \u221215 base upstream of the translation initiation sequence, the correlated expressions of xeEPOR and Xenopus GATA-1 on developing embryo were evaluated with RT-PCR. The xeEPOR RNA was abundantly expressed at Nieuwkoop stage 30 (blood island formation) and thereafter, and temporally followed the expression of GATA-1, suggesting that the functional expression of xeEPOR was upregulated by GATA-1 in Xenopus as reported in studies on mammalian erythropoiesis. To confirm biological functions of the molecule, soluble xeEPOR was administered into adult Xenopus by intracardiac consecutive injections. The peripheral erythrocyte counts were gradually decreased; meanwhile immature erythrocytes were emerged in the circulation, demonstrating that this molecule plays a significant physiological role in erythropoiesis in Xenopus .",
