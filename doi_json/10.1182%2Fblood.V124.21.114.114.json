    "abstract_text": "Generation of \u03b1-thrombin (FIIa) in response to vascular injury is a key mechanism influencing thrombus formation. Platelet activation by FIIa is mediated by different protease activated receptors (PARs), although the most abundant FIIa binding site on platelets, but not a substrate for proteolysis, is glycoprotein (GP) Ib\u03b1 in the GPIb-IX-V complex. The functional role of GPIb\u03b1 in mediating/regulation thrombin functions relative to that of different PARs remains unclear. The goal of these studies was to define how binding to GPIb\u03b1 can modulate FIIa functions. In mouse platelets we replaced endogenous GPIb\u03b1 with either its human wild type counterpart (huGPIb\u03b1-WT) or with huGPIb\u03b1 mutated at key residues involved in thrombin binding (D277N, Y276-8-9/F). Because these two mutations resulted in an undistinguishable phenotype, they are designated collectively as huGPIb\u03b1-Mut hereon. Mice expressing huGPIb\u03b1, WT or Mut, were evaluated in intravital models of arterial thrombosis induced by a ferric chloride-induced carotid artery lesion and venous thromboembolism induced by intravenous \u03b1-thrombin injection. Moreover, the blood of huGPIb\u03b1 WT or Mut mice was also tested in an ex vivo model of thrombus formation upon perfusion over a thrombogenic surface under controlled flow conditions and platelets were evaluated for their responses to FIIa-induced activation. Mice expressing huGPIb\u03b1 - WT or Mut - have comparable platelet counts and GPIb\u03b1 surface density. Moreover, huGPIb\u03b1-WT platelets bind FIIa similarly than their normal human control counterpart, while huGPIb\u03b1-Mut platelets have essentially no detectable FIIa binding. Upon FIIa stimulation, which on mouse platelets is mediated by PAR4, aggregation and Ca 2+ transients were significantly enhanced in huGPIb\u03b1-Mut as compared to huGPIb\u03b1-WT. In contrast, blocking FIIa binding to GPIb\u03b1 on human platelets essentially abolished FIIa mediated activation, which in human occurs predominantly through PAR1. These results are compatible with the conclusion that, in mice, GPIb\u03b1 is a competitive inhibitor of FIIa for PAR4-mediated functions. In the presence of metabolically inactive (PGE 1 treated) huGPIb\u03b1-Mut washed platelets, the clotting time of a purified fibrinogen solution was significantly shorter when triggered by relative high concentration of FIIa (4 nM), but pronouncedly prolonged at a lower FIIa concentration (0.5 nM). Clot visualization showed a much more structured fibrin mesh in the presence of huGPIb\u03b1-WT platelets, which was lost with in the presence of huGPIb\u03b1-Mut platelets. Mutant mice tested in a model of carotid artery injury exhibited a pronounced prothrombotic phenotype, with a shorter time to occlusion. However they were protected from death induced by I.V. injection of \u03b1-thrombin. In ex vivo perfusion studies, the total volume of platelet aggregates formed in huGPIb\u03b1-Mut mouse blood exposed to acid-insoluble fibrillar collagen type I was slightly bigger than in huGPIb\u03b1-WT mice, but the number of thrombi was increased and their individual size smaller. These huGPIb\u03b1-Mut platelets exhibited clear signs of increased activation, as visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Strikingly, fibrin was almost totally absent in the huGPIb\u03b1-Mut thrombi. This was in striking contrast with what observed in huGPIb\u03b1-WT mice, in which the surface of platelet thrombi with directly and tightly connected with thick fibrin fibers as visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Possibly because of the reduced platelet membrane-fibrin fibril connection in huGPIb\u03b1-Mut platelets, these mice were significantly less susceptible to death when injected with an \u03b1-thrombin dose that caused 80% mortality plus in huGPIb\u03b1-WT mice. Thus, mice whose platelets have defective \u03b1-thrombin binding to GPIb\u03b1 have a prothrombotic phenotype in high shear stress flow arteries and are protected from thromboembolic death in the low shear stress venous circulation. Our findings identify GPIb\u03b1 as a relevant FIIa activity modulator in hemostasis and thrombosis through distinct and opposite mechanisms affecting platelet activation (The Yin) and fibrin formation (The Yang).
