    "abstract_text": "Drug resistance to imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has been linked to BCR/ABL gene amplification or mutations in its tyrosine kinase domain of BCR/ABL gene (Phi). However the role of the ABC-transporters in the multidrug resistant phenotype still remains to be clarified. Objective: to study the functional expression of multidrug resistance gene-1 (MDR-1) and breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP), in imatinib pharmacoresistant K562 Phi+ cells. Materials and methods: K562 Phi+ cultured cells (ATCC catN \u00b0 :CCL-2439) were immunophenotyped by flow cytometry, mRNA transcripts of BCR/ABL and MDR-1 were amplified by RT-PCR and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the product of MDR-1 gene and BCRP, were investigated by inmunocytochemistry, using specific monoclonal antibodies (P-gp: clones C494 and C219; BCRP: clone BXP-21). Total efflux activity of Rhodamine-123 (Rho-123) and its inhibition by Cyclosporin A (CyA) or 4 \u00b0 C, were evaluated using flow cytometry. The apoptotic effect in K-562 cells after 24hs and 72hs of treatment with imatinib (2\u03bcmol.L \u22121 ) with or without CyA (3ugm.L \u22121 ), was evaluated by staining the cells with 1 mL of a mixture of acridine orange (100 mg.mL \u22121 ) and ethidium bromide (100 mg.mL \u22121 ) in PBS. Results: The immunophenotype was: HLA-DR-,CD45++,CD11c\u2212/+,CD13+,CD14\u2212,CD15\u2212/+,CD16\u2212,CD33+,CD34\u2212CD117\u2212/+; CD56\u2212, CD61\u2212/+; CD2\u2212, CD3\u2212, CD4\u2212, CD7\u2212, CD8\u2212, CD10+, CD19\u2212, glyA+ . MDR-1 and BCR/ABL transcripts were highly expressed, and P-gp and BCRP immunostaining were also positive. Rho-123 efflux was inhibited by CyA (3ugm.L \u22121 ) or 4 \u00b0 C. Increased apoptotic effect (from 7, 21% to 20, 79%) at 24hs and (11% to 53%) at 72hs was observed with combined imatinib+CyA treatment compared with imatinib alone.(p<0.01*) Conclusions. Our results suggest that P-gp and BCRP might play an active role in the pharmacoresistance to imatinib treatment in K562Phi+ cells. Combined treatment with Imatinib+CyA (or other more specific inhibitors of P-gp and BCRP) could increase the apoptotic effect in BCR/ABL over-expressing refractory cells.
