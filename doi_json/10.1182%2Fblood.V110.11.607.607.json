    "abstract_text": "Bone marrow (BM) stromal cells seem to be crucial in the establishment of the hematopoietic niches in bone marrow. BM stromal cells can communicate through gap junctions, which consist of narrow channels between contacting cells and are composed by connexins. Connexin 43 (Cx43) is expressed by BM stromal cells and upon adhesion to stroma, by hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors (HSC/P). Cx43 has been shown to be essential in controlling osteoblast and fibroblast function. We have previously reported that Cx43 is critical for the interaction between stroma and HSC/P in CAFC assays (Cancelas J.A. et al., Blood 2000) and in adult hematopoiesis after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) administration in Mx1-Cre-Tg;Cx43KO mice (Presley C, et al., Cell Comm. Adh., 2005). We have also previously shown that after 5-FU administration, Cx43 is predominantly expressed in the endosteum and the deficiency of Cx43 in stroma of Collagen I (ColI)-Cre;Cx43KO and chimeric mice impairs their hematopoiesis by impairing the homing of wild-type (WT) hematopoietic progenitors and after 5-FU administration, the hematopoietic progenitor cycling inducing a \u223c30% expansion of the long-term stem cell compartment in BM (Li L et al., ASH 2006). Interestingly, stromal Cx43-deficient mice contain around twice as many CFU-F as wild-type (WT) mice. Now, we have further investigated the role of stromal Cx43 expression in the regulation of hematopoietic progenitor adhesion to stroma, trans-stromal migration and mobilization. Cx43-deficient stromal cells display complete absence of intercellular communication as assayed by calcein dye transfer which can be reverted by retroviral transduction of Cx43. Trans-stromal migration of hematopoietic progenitors through Cx43-deficient irradiated stroma is impaired (7.8% vs 13.8% in WT stroma, p=0.015) but primary adhesion to Cx43-deficient irradiated stroma and in vivo mobilization response to G-CSF in ColI-Cre;Cx43KO mice were similar to WT controls, suggesting that stromal Cx43 plays a role in the regulation of the post-adhesion migration of HSC/P. On the other hand, Cx43-deficient HSC/P from Vav1-Cre;Cx43KO primary and chimeric mice show severe impairment of blood cell formation during the recovery phase after 5-FU administration (day +14) compared to wild-type controls (ANC: 0.23\u00b10.12 vs 1.40\u00b11.25 x 10 9 neutrophils/L; Platelet count: 135\u00b191 vs 572\u00b1205 x 10 9 platelets/L; p < 0.05). Cx43 deficiency in hematopoietic progenitors did not significantly impair their homing ability in wild-type mice. Taken together, these studies indicate that Cx43 expression plays distinct roles in the regulation of hematopoietic intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. While Cx43 expression in stroma seems to be crucial in the regulation of the stromal progenitor and HSC pool content as well as HSC/P trans-stromal migration and homing, deficiency of Cx43 in either hematopoietic cells or stromal cells independently induce a significant impairment in the post-chemotherapy blood formation in vivo, suggesting that, under stress, hematopoietic regeneration depends on complete Cx43 channels communicating HSC/P and stromal cells."
