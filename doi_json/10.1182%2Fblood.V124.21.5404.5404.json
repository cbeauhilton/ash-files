    "abstract_text": "MYC protein expression has been identified to be associated with inferior overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) when coexpressed with BCL-2 protein in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). But the concurrent expression of MYC and BCL-2 proteins in primary gastrointestinal (PGI)-DLBCL has not been clearly understood. Here, we investigated whether this coexpression has prognostic significance in PGI-DLBCL patients and explored its associations with patients\u2019 clinical parameters. We enrolled 60 PGI-DLBCL patients and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Expression levels of MYC and BCL-2 were detected from both protein and mRNA levels by immunohistochemistry and real-time RT-PCR. Positive expression levels of MYC and BCL-2 proteins were detected in 35% and 45% of patients, respectively. MYC+/BCL-2+ protein was present in 30% of patients. MYC and BCL-2 protein were correlated with high MYC and BCL-2 mRNA expression, respectively (both p<0.05). We found that patients with advanced-stage disease (at IIE-IV) having higher MYC and BCL-2 coexpression levels (p<0.05). In addition, MYC+/BCL-2+ patients had more difficulty achieving complete remission than others (p<0.05). Presence of MYC protein expression only affected OS and PFS when BCL-2 protein was coexpressed. The adverse prognostic impact of MYC+/BCL-2+ protein on PFS remained significant (p<0.05) even after adjusting for age, Lugano stage, IPI, and BCL-2 protein expression in a multivariable model. MYC+/BCL-2+ patients have poorer chemotherapy response and poorer prognosis than patients who only express one of the two proteins, suggesting that assessment of MYC and BCL-2 expression by immunohistochemistry has clinical significance in predicting prognosis of PGI-DLBCL patients.
