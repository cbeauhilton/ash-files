    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2026 Platelets are key players in hemostasis and their senescence is intrinsically associated with the activation of apoptotic pathways that shows similarities to the apoptosis of nucleated cells. Anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xl restrains the pro-apoptotic Bak activity and maintains platelet survival in circulation. In nucleated cells, serine phosphorylation of a pro-apoptotic protein Bad can also promote cell survival. Serine phosphorylation of Bad is regulated by the action of serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinases and Ser/Thr protein phosphatases. Although alterations in the activities of either enzyme can change the rate of apoptosis, whether Ser/Thr phosphatases participate in regulating platelet apoptosis is unknown. In this study, we report that the mice lacking the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 gamma (PP1c\u03b3) exhibit a moderate but significant increase in the number of circulating platelets [596 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcL \u00b1 17.9 in WT compared with 694 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcL \u00b1 19.8 in PP1c\u03b3 \u2013/\u2013 mice; P = .0003]. Examination of the bone marrow from the PP1c\u03b3 \u2013/\u2013 mice revealed a non-significant increase in the number of morphologically matured megakaryocytes. A trend towards decreased plasma thrombopoietin levels were also noticed in PP1c\u03b3 \u2013/\u2013 mice. These observations suggest that an increased megakaryopoiesis/thrombopoiesis may not fully account for the increased platelet numbers in PP1c\u03b3 \u2013/\u2013 mice. In vivo platelet survival studies revealed that the loss of PP1c\u03b3 modestly increased platelet half life in circulation (t1/2 \u223c69 hours in WT compared to \u223c78 hours in PP1c\u03b3 \u2013/\u2013 mice). PP1c\u03b3 \u2013/\u2013 platelets had decreased mean platelet volume, suggesting the PP1c\u03b3 \u2013/\u2013 mice may harbor a greater proportion of older circulating platelets. These studies are consistent with the delayed clearance of platelets from PP1c\u03b3 \u2013/\u2013 mice. Pro-apoptotic Bad possess PP1c binding motif and mechanistically, PP1c\u03b3 interacts with Bad protein in platelets. Phosphorylation of Bad Ser112, which promotes cell survival, was enhanced \u223c50% in PP1c\u03b3 \u2013/\u2013 platelets. Consistent with the increased BAD phosphorylation, co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed increased BAD-14-3-3 protein complexes from the PP1c\u03b3 \u2013/\u2013 platelets. It is reported that in the phosphorylated state, BAD can interact with 14-3-3 and is sequestered in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing the binding of Bad with the mitochondrial anti-apoptotic Bcl-xl. Interaction of Bad with Bcl-xl has the potential to displace the pro-apoptotic Bak from the Bcl-xl-Bak protein complex to trigger apoptosis. Finally, immunoblotting with anti-caspase 9 antibody revealed decreased caspase 9 cleavage product (\u223c37 kDa) in the PP1c\u03b3 \u2013/\u2013 platelets, suggesting decreased activation of caspase 9 dependent apoptotic pathway. These data indicate that the increased platelet counts in PP1c\u03b3 \u2013/\u2013 mice could be in part due to delayed platelet apoptosis. Loss of PP1c\u03b3 leads to the hyperphosphorylation of BAD, which via an interaction with 14-3-3, delays caspase mediated apoptosis to prolong the life span of platelets.
