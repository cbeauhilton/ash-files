    "abstract_text": "Gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells has been envisaged as an alternative to stem cell transplantation for the treatment of many genetic diseases of the blood system. In 2004 we initiated a gene therapy trial aimed at the correction of Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD), a rare inherited immunodeficiency caused by a functional defect in the microbial killing activity of phagocytes. Gene marking and functional correction of phagocytes were high shortly after transplantation of gene modified cells, leading to the eradication of therapy resistant infections from which patients had suffered for many years. However, one of our patients died 27 months after treatment due to a severe sepsis with multiorgan dysfunction. Although gene marking was still high at this time point, expression of the therapeutic gene, gp91phox, was minimal. This down regulation of transgene expression was due to CpG methylation within the viral LTR. Similar effects were observed in a second patient treated more than 3 years ago. In both patients CpG methylation was restricted to the promoter region of the viral LTR, while CpG dinucleotides within the enhancer region of the viral LTRs were not methylated. As a consequence, gp91phox gene expression was suppressed but the capacity of the viral LTRs to transactivate nearby sequences is still intact. Indeed we were able to detect cellular transcripts at predominant retroviral integration sites leading to an unbalanced clonal distribution of gene marked cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow. A third patient, a 5 years old child was treated in a similar way in Zurich. In this case only low levels of engraftment and gene correction were achieved. Although the treatment has been beneficial for all treated patients, the side effects observed in the two adults demand modifications in vector design for sustained gene expression and long term correction of the disease without side effects.",
