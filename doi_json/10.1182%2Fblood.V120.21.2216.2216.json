    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2216 Baxter is currently developing a recombinant ADAMTS13 (rADAMTS13, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) product for potential prophylaxis and treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). We established a disease model in ADAMTS13 ko mice (B6.129-ADAMTS13 tm1Dgi ), in which the animals simultaneously and consistently develop TTP-like symptoms by challenge with a high dose of human recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF) containing ultra-large VWF multimers. To test the prophylactic efficacy of Baxter's rADAMTS13, groups of 10 ADAMTS13 ko mice received single doses of rADAMTS13 (1, 5, 40, 80 or 200U/kg) before challenge with rVWF. Doses of 1 and 5mL/kg fresh frozen plasma corresponding to 1 and 5U/kg ADAMTS13 served as positive controls. In a second study, the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of Baxter's rADAMTS13 was tested over time. Groups of 10 ADAMTS13 ko mice received a single dose of 200 FRETS-U/kg rADAMTS13 5min-120h before, or 15\u2013180min after challenge with rVWF. In both studies, buffer was used as a negative control. Efficacy was defined as the degree of prevention of platelet drop and LDH increase. Schistocytosis and organ damage were also assessed. Morbidity in negative controls was 100%: all animals receiving rVWF containing ultra-large VWF multimers were severely thrombocytopenic, showed increased LDH levels, schistocytosis and organ damage. Prophylactic treatment with rADAMTS13 prevented LDH increase (p<0.0001), and dose-dependently prevented thrombocytopenia (p\u22640.0003), schistocytosis and alleviated organ damage compared to treatment with buffer. Efficacy of rADAMTS13 was treatment interval-dependent in both studies. Platelet count at termination of all rADAMTS13-treated animals was statistically higher than that of buffer-treated controls (p\u22640.0001). However, animals receiving prophylactic treatment 120h before administration of rVWF showed severe thrombocytopenia; clinically relevant protection was only seen with treatment intervals \u226472h. Therapeutic treatment with rADAMTS13 stabilized platelet count and prevented further thrombocytopenia. LDH, schistocytosis and organ damage confirmed the treatment interval-dependent improvement in platelet count. In summary, Baxter's rADAMTS13 was effective in an rVWF-induced animal model closely mimicking the situation in patients with hereditary TTP. Comparison with FFP, the current standard of treatment of TTP, showed Baxter's rADAMTS13 to have similar or slightly improved efficacy. Disclosures: Schiviz: Baxter Innovations GmbH: Employment.
