    "abstract_text": "The class of the so-called long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is defined by their lacking coding potential and their length of more than 200 nucleotides. LncRNAs are readily detected in transcriptome analysis but have so far not been characterized or catalogued exhaustively. Although lncRNAs make up a major portion of the mammalian non-coding transcriptome, it is challenging to predict their functions due to their diversity in terms of size, sequence and biogenesis. However, several lncRNAs have already been shown to be involved in crucial cellular processes such as imprinting, regulation of cell proliferation and cellular differentiation. Their mode of action generally involves epigenetic modifications as well as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Within the ICGC (International Cancer Genome Consortium)-MMML-Seq (Molecular Mechanisms in Malignant Lymphoma by Sequencing) Consortium, which aims at fully characterizing a total of 250 germinal center derived B-cell lymphomas, including Burkitt lymphoma (BL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL), we conducted a search for yet unidentified genes. We here report the identification of a novel transcript, which we have named BLUT (Burkitt Lymphoma Unknown Transcript). BLUT is highly expressed in BL, with only very low expression levels in FL and no detectable expression in DLBCL. It is around 1050 nucleotides long with splice evidence for three exons, whereby exons 1 and 3 are shared between all isoforms. BLUT represents a putative lncRNA since it lacks conserved protein domains and has a splice site conservation pattern typical of non-coding transcripts. Furthermore, it is predicted as non-coding by the software Coding Potential Calculator and there was not a single peptide match between a published peptide database (Human Proteome Map) and any potential BLUT peptide (all isoforms). Moreover, BLUT shares a high sequence identity with two (so far) uncharacterized non-coding RNAs (Pan Troglodyte, Chlorocebus sabeus). We tested a cell line panel (consisting of 16 different cell lines including non-lymphoma cell lines) for BLUT expression but could only detect it in the two BL cell lines Namalwa and Raji. Cellular fractionation experiments showed that BLUT is predominantly localized in the nucleus in both Namalwa and Raji. Overexpression of BLUT in SU-DHL-4 resulted in the identification of 222 differentially regulated genes (FDR < 0.05) with a logFC of \u00b1 0.25, among which 49 genes had a logFC of \u00b1 0.50. Several lymphoma relevant genes were part of this list including BIN1, CCL22, CCR7, EBI3, ID2, JAG1, NQO1, and RGS1. Given its nuclear localization, we currently perform chromatin isolation by RNA purification experiments to identify the genomic regions which BLUT binds to. In combination with our overexpression data this will allow further insights into the functions of BLUT. In summary, we have identified a novel long-noncoding RNA termed BLUT, which is differentially expressed between lymphoma subtypes with a high expression in Burkitt lymphoma. Overexpression of BLUT resulted in the deregulation of several genes with known roles in lymphomagenesis. Given its predominantly nuclear localization, we are currently investigating its functions on chromatin regulation.
