    "abstract_text": "AHSP binds alpha hemoglobin (Hb) to maintain its structure and limit its prooxidant activities. In addition, AHSP binds and stabilizes apo-alpha globin, which lacks heme. Previously, we demonstrated that Ahsp \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit hemolytic anemia with Hb precipitation in erythroid cells. Through interbreeding of mutant strains, we also showed that loss of AHSP exacerbates beta thalassemia. Together, these studies indicate that AHSP participates in Hb homeostasis and may act to neutralize potentially toxic excess alpha globin that is known to accumulate in normal erythroid precursors, and to a greater extent, in beta thalassemic ones. However, additional functions for AHSP may exist. In particular, AHSP-alpha globin complexes may also promote HbA synthesis. To test this, we depleted the pool of excess alpha globin in Ahsp \u2212/\u2212 mice by interbreeding with alpha thalassemic ones. Compared to mice with either mutation alone, compound mutants missing both AHSP and one alpha globin allele (genotype Ahsp \u2212/\u2212 // alpha globin *\u03b1/\u03b1\u03b1 ) exhibited more severe erythroid defects, including worsened anemia, hypochromia, Hb instability and ineffective erythropoiesis. Pulse-labeling of double-mutant reticulocytes showed that alpha to beta globin synthetic ratios were unaffected by loss of AHSP, but precipitation of both alpha and beta nascent chains into cell membranes was strongly enhanced. These data indicate that AHSP is important for erythropoiesis and Hb production even when alpha globin is not produced in excess. In vitro translation studies using wheat germ extracts showed that recombinant AHSP present during the synthesis of alpha globin improved its ability to become incorporated into HbA. Moreover, AHSP conferred protease resistance to nascent alpha globin, suggesting enhanced folding into the native state. Further supporting this interpretation, circular dichroism studies showed that AHSP accelerated refolding of purified denatured alpha Hb. Finally, through pulse labeling of reticulocytes followed by isoelectric focusing of soluble cytosolic fractions, we identified transient pools of free alpha Hb and AHSP-alpha Hb in vivo and showed that Ahsp gene ablation fully depleted both pools. Together, our studies indicate that AHSP acts as a molecular chaperone to promote alpha globin folding and stability prior to its incorporation into HbA. In addition, it is possible that alterations in AHSP gene function or expression could modulate alpha thalassemia severity in patients."
