    "abstract_text": "Background Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients have higher rates of second primary malignancies. There is limited data on second primary malignancies (SPM) among adult patients with ALL. This study was conducted to evaluate SPM in adult ALL patients using US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registry database. Methods We analyzed the SEER 13 Registries using multiple primary standardized incidence ratio (MP-SIR) session. We analyzed secondary cancer rates among adult ALL patients during the period 1992 - 2010. We used SEER*Stat software provided by national cancer institute for statistical analysis. Results There were 3,259 adult (age \u226520 years) ALL patients reported in SEER database during 1992-2010. Among them, 65 ALL patients developed 75 second primary malignancies. Fifty-nine ALL patients developed 1 SPM each, 3 ALL patients developed 2 SPM each, 2 ALL patients developed 3 SPM each and 1 ALL patient developed 4 SPM. All site cancers were significantly higher among adult ALL patients compared to general population with observed/expected ratio (O/E): 1.47, p value< 0.05, an absolute excess risk of 24.43 per 10,000 populations. Similarly, oral cavity cancer, respiratory system cancer and hematological SPM were significantly higher in ALL patients than expected in general population.
