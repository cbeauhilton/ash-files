    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1887 NK cells play an important role in anti-tumor immunity. They significantly contribute to the clinical success of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Their reactivity as a consequence of an integrative response mediated by various activating and inhibitory surface receptors results in the induction of yet only partially defined signal transduction pathways. One of the major transcriptional regulators in lymphoid cells is NFAT (Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells). While its role in T cell development and function is meanwhile well defined, surprisingly little is known on its function in NK cells. NFAT seems to be dispensable for NK cell development, but several lines of evidence clearly point to its involvement in NK reactivity and function. Cyclosporin A (CsA) and tacrolimus are immunosuppressive drugs that are widely used in transplant medicine. They mediate their immunosuppressive effects through inhibition of the serine/threonine phosphatase calci-neurin, which dephosphorylates and thereby activates NFAT. Here we studied the role of NFAT in NK cells and found that all five NFAT family members are expressed in NK cells with their levels being dependent on NK cell activation state. CsA and tacrolimus, but not mycophenolic acid which mediates its immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, reduced activation and degranulation of NK cells, resulting in impaired cytotoxicity and IFN-\u03b3 production in response to leukemia targets. NK reactivity was also suppressed by the specific NFAT inhibitors VIVIT and INCA-6, indicating that the calcineurin inhibitors CsA and tacrolimus in fact modulate NK reactivity by inhibition of NFAT proteins and not by potential \u201coff target\u201d-effects. These results provide evidence for the critical involvement of the transcription factor NFAT in NK cell reactivity and also indicate that potential effects on NK cell immunosurveillance should be considered upon choice and dosing of immunosuppressive treatment regimens after SCT.
