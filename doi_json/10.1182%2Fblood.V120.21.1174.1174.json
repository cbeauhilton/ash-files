Current optimal intervention for inhibitor eradication is immune tolerance induction (ITI), the goal of which is for the patient to resume therapy with FVIII. Basic and clinical research have strongly supported that VWF containing FVIII concentrates may be less immunogenic and are effective in primary ITI as well as for rescue ITI for those who fail to develop tolerance with recombinant proteins. Objective To assess the outcome of rescue and primary ITI in children (<18 years old) and adults with a single FVIII/VWF product (Fanhdi\u00ae, Grifols, Barcelona, Spain). Methods Retrospective data from HA patients (FVIII< 2%) with inhibitors from 22 centers in Spain, Italy and Germany, who underwent primary or rescue ITI with FVIII/VWF concentrate were evaluated. Success, partial success and failure were defined based on the criteria of the consensus recommendations of the 2006 International ITI Workshop. Results The largest international multicenter study on ITI using a single product has evaluated 41 cases of primary ITI (32 children and 9 adults) and 19 cases of rescue ITI (17 children and 2 adults). Table 1. illustrates the overall response rates for children and adults.  Table 1 . Primary ITI . Rescue ITI .

Risk factors for poor response include: failure of a previous ITI, inhibitor peak >200 BU, age at ITI start >7 years old, titer \u2265 10 BU at ITI start and >24 months between diagnosis and start of ITI.

View Large Conclusion The response rate of 87% (CS+PS) in primary ITI exceeds that previously reported with any product class. The response rate (CS+PS) of 74% in the higher risk profile of rescue ITI is what one might expect for primary ITI. These excellent results, using a single VWF containing FVIII product, should encourage the use of this class of product for immune tolerance.
