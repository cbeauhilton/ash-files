    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2790 Background: The development of more effective front-line regimens for lymphoma (e.g. R-CHOP, BEACOPP) has resulted in lower response rates to salvage regimens such as Ifosphamide, Carboplatin, Etoposide +/\u2212 Rituximab (RICE/ICE) and improved strategies are needed. Vorinostat (V) is a well-tolerated, oral pan-HDAC inhibitor approved for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. In vitro data indicate that combinations of V at >2-5\u03bcM plus etoposide or platinum analogs yield synergistic anti-tumor activity, but these concentrations are not typically attained with standard dose regimens. We hypothesized that pulse high-dose V could safely augment the anti-tumor activity of ICE/RICE for patients with relapsed lymphoma. Here we present the final results of a multi-center Phase I trial defining the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetics of V that can be given with RICE or ICE. Methods: Eligibility included: relapsed/refractory lymphoma (untreated T-NHL or mantle cell lymphoma [MCL] allowed), age \u226518 years, performance status of 0\u20132, measurable disease, no active CNS involvement, ANC \u2265 1,500/\u03bcL, plts \u2265 100,000/\u03bcL, adequate hepatic/renal function, no known HIV. The primary objective was to define a maximally tolerated dose associated with a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) rate of \u2264 25%. DLT = gastrointestinal grade 3 NCI-CTCAE adverse event (AE) >7 days, any related non-hematologic grade \u22654 AE, inability to complete one full cycle of therapy due to toxicity, or any significant medical event at the discretion of the PI. Interpatient dose escalation was implemented using a \u201ctwo stage\u201d design (Storer et al) with single patient cohorts until a DLT was observed, followed by cohorts of 4 patients. Therapy consisted of V ranging from 400 mg daily to 700 mg BID days 1 to 5 in combination with standard ICE or RICE (CD20+ only) delivered on days 3 to 5 every 21 days for up to 2 cycles using G-CSF support. Results: Twenty-nine patients were treated, 9 in stage 1, 20 in stage 2. Baseline features: median age = 56 (range 23 to 69), median prior therapies 2 (range 0 \u2013 7), refractory to last regimen = 14 (of 27 evaluable, 52%), and prior transplant 2 (7%). Histologies: Hodgkin Lymphoma (8), Diffuse large B-cell (7), MCL (5), T-NHL (4), Follicular (3), Marginal Zone (1), and Small Lymphocytic lymphoma (1). Fifteen patients received 2 cycles and 14 received 1 cycle due to a DLT (8), patient/MD choice (4), insurance denial (1), or progressive disease (1). Non-hematologic AEs \u2265 grade 3 were observed in 25 patients with 14 experiencing grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or anorexia. The most common DLTs were infection (n=2), hypokalemia (n=2), transaminitis (n=2) ( Table ). The MTD was estimated to be 500mg BID \u00d7 5 days with full dose ICE/RICE. Responses were observed in 19 of 27 evaluable patients (70%) including 8 CR/CRU and 11 PR. Mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells was successful in 4 of 9 patients immediately following VICE/VRICE (median 5.52\u00d710 6 CD34/kg), in all 4 attempting after prior unsuccessful VICE/VRICE mobilization (median 4.4 \u00d7 10 6 CD34/kg), and in all 12 others attempting after a subsequent regimen (median 7.5 \u00d7 10 6 CD34/kg). 25 (86%) patients are alive and 15 (52%) are progression-free with a median follow up of 5 months (range 1 \u2013 23 months). Pharmacokinetic data indicated that the median peak V concentration day 3 was 4.5\u03bcM (range 4.2\u20136.0\u03bcM). Studies are underway evaluating the impact of high-dose V on histone acetylation patterns, BCL-2 family proteins, and gene expression profiles of patient-derived normal and tumor cells and will be reported. Conclusions: High-dose V can safely be delivered with ICE/RICE, achieves potentially synergistic drug levels, and responses are encouraging, though adequate prophylaxis and treatment of GI toxicity is required. The Phase II dose of V with ICE/RICE is defined as 500mg BID \u00d7 5 days and warrants further study.  Dose level . Vorinostat Dose . n . DLT .
