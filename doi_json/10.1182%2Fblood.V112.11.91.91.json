    "abstract_text": "Background: The combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone (RD) has been shown to be highly effective as initial therapy for multiple myeloma. More recently, a phase III trial demonstrated improved survival with use of lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone (Rd). Further improvements by incorporating other active agents may increase the depth of response and may improve long-term outcome. We report the results from a phase II trial combining lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone with cyclophosphamide (RCd) as initial therapy for newly diagnosed MM. Methods: The trial was initiated in July 2006 and completed the initial target accrual of 33 patients by July 2007 (Cohort 1). Due to high rate of dose reductions in cohort 1, between July 2007 and May 2008 an additional 20 patients were enrolled with lower doses of cyclophosphamide (Cohort 2). The treatment protocol consisted of lenalidomide given orally at a dose of 25 mg daily on days 1\u201321 of a 28-day cycle. Dex was given orally at a dose of 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle. Cyclophosphamide at a dose of 300 mg/m 2 was given on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle in cohort 1 and 300 mg on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle in cohort 2. Patients also received an aspirin once daily as thromboprophylaxis. Response was defined as a decrease in serum monoclonal (M) protein by 50% or higher and a decrease in urine M protein by at least 90% or to a level less than 200 mg/24 hours. Responses were assessed on intent to treat basis. Results: 53 patients were enrolled. The median age was 64 years (range, 37\u201382). 14 patients (29%) had ISS stage III disease. The median number of cycles was 4 (range: 1 \u2013 20). The best response based on all enrolled patients on an intent to treat basis was 83%, including CR:1 (2%), VGPR: 20 (38%), PR: 23 (43%), and less than PR: 9 (17%). The CR plus VGPR rate was 40%. Among the 20 patients in cohort 2 who were enrolled after optimization of the cyclophosphamide dosing, 16 (80%) have already achieved a partial response or better with 17 patients in this cohort still receiving study treatment. Overall, 25 of the 53 enrolled patients have discontinued study treatment. Reasons for ending treatment are: completed study per protocol (14), disease progression (5), adverse event (3) and alternate treatment (3). This includes 3 patients from cohort 2, one completed treatment per protocol, one went to alternate therapy and one patient went off for progression. Hematological toxicity was the most common with grade 4 toxicity seen in 8 patients (only 1 from cohort 2). Non-hematological toxicities included neuropathy, diarrhea, cystitis, and thrombosis. There were 6 patients with grade 4 non-hematological toxicities (none from cohort 2) attributed to the drug (thrombosis, confusion, depression and sepsis). Thirteen patients had dose adjustments, most commonly due to hematological toxicity attributed to lenalidomide or cyclophosphamide. One patient has died off study, of intracranial hemorrhage. The median follow-up for the remaining patients is 7.8 months. Conclusions: The combination of lenalidomide, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (RCd) has excellent activity in the setting of newly diagnosed myeloma. Seventeen patients continue on study and the response rates are likely to be higher with additional followup. Myelosuppression was a significant toxicity leading to dose reductions and cycle delays, and is lower with decreased dose of CTX in cohort 2 without any apparent loss of responses.",
