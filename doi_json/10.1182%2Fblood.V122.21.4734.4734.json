    "abstract_text": "Objective To investigate clinical characteristics, fungal species, predisposing and prognostic factors of hematological patients with fungemia. Method: The clinical data of clinical features, distribution of fungus, risk factors of 47 hematological patients with fungemia in our department were retrospectively analyzed. Results: All patients suffered from fever and received broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. Agranulocytosis occurred in 42(89.4%) patients. Thirty-two (68.1%) patients were nosocomial infections. Forty-three (91.5%) patients were complicated by infections of other sites, the most common site of infections was from respiratory(78.6%). 29 (61.7%) patients with more than 15 hospitalized days before fungemia. Candida tropicalis (57.1%)was the most frequently fungal isolate. Among Of the 47 patients, 12 (25.5%) patients were dead. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, the duration of agranulocytosis, presence of shock, and the initiation of antifungal therapy are the independent prognostic factors for mortality. Conclusion: To pay attention to antifungal prophylaxis for hematological patients with the predisposing factors of fungemia. To treat fungemia promptly and appropriately, shorten duration of agranulocytosis and prevent shock to improve the prognosis. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
