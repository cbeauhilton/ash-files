    "abstract_text": "Purpose: Drug resistance is the greatest obstacle to the successful treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). We investigated whether the clinical XPO1 inhibitor selinexor (KPT-330), when combined with bortezomib or carfilzomib, could overcome proteasome inhibitor (PI) resistance in myeloma. Experimental Design: PI-resistant human MM cell lines 8226-B25 and U266-PSR were treated with the XPO1 inhibitors selinexor or KOS-2464 in combination with bortezomib or carfilzomib and assayed for apoptosis and viability. Mice challenged with PI-resistant human MM cells (U266-PSR) were treated with selinexor +/- bortezomib. CD138 + /light-chain + MM cells from PI-refractory MM patients were treated with selinexor +/- bortezomib or selinexor +/- carfilzomib and assayed for apoptosis. All experiments were compared to the standard of care, bortezomib therapy. IkB\u03b1-protein was assayed by Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy and IkB\u03b1-NFkB-complex formation by proximity ligation assay. IkB\u03b1 protein knockdown in human MM cells by siRNA was performed to determine the mechanism of selinexor inhibitor action. Further analysis of selinexor/bortezomib treatment on intra-cellular protein levels and intra-cellular localization was performed by lysine and N-terminal labeling with six-plex tandem mass tags (heavy isotope) and assayed by LC-MS/MS discovery proteomics. Results: Selinexor in combination with bortezomib or carfilzomib decreased viability and induced apoptosis in PI-resistant MM cells. Resistant MM cell lines were up to 10-fold resistant to single agent bortezomib or carfilzomib when compared to parental cells. The combination of the XPO1 inhibitors selinexor or KOS-2464 sensitized drug resistant cells to bortezomib ( P < 0.02) and carfilzomib ( P < 0.005) when compared to single agents. Selinexor and bortezomib inhibited PI-resistant MM tumor growth and increased survival with minimal toxicity in NOD/SCID-g mice. Bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated and treated with selinexor or KOS-2464 and bortezomib or carfilzomib from newly diagnosed (n=8), relapsed (n=5), and bortezomib (n=8) and carfilzomib (n=6) refractory MM patient samples were all sensitized by selinexor and KOS-2464 to bortezomib ( P < 0.043) and carfilzomib ( P < 0.044) as shown by increased apoptosis. Normal, non-myeloma CD138/light-chain double-negative patient cells were not sensitized to apoptosis by XPO1 inhibitors. Immunofluorescence microscopy of IkB\u03b1 in 8226-B25 PI-resistant cells showed an increase in IkB\u03b1 after treatment with selinexor/bortezomib as compared with vehicle control or single agent bortezomib or selinexor. Nuclear I\u03baB\u03b1 was also increased by selinexor treatment. IkB\u03b1 protein expression was increased by bortezomib (70%) and selinexor (50%) versus control. The selinexor/bortezomib combination increased IkB\u03b1 protein (212%) as compared to vehicle control or single agent bortezomib or selinexor. Similar results were found in drug-na\u00efve 8226 and U226 cells, as well as PI-resistant 8226-B25 and U225-PSR cells. The increase in nuclear IkB\u03b1 after selinexor treatment was confirmed by ImageStream flow cytometry. Selinexor/bortezomib therapy significantly increased IkB\u03b1-NFkB-complexes in PI-resistant MM cells. Selinexor in combination with bortezomib increased proximity co-localization of NFkB and IkB\u03b1 without affecting XPO1 protein expression after 4 hours of drug treatment. Analysis of the number of NFkB-IkB\u03b1 foci/binding showed that selinexor/bortezomib increased the number of foci in the nucleus versus untreated control or single agent selinexor or bortezomib ( P \u2264 0.00077). IkB\u03b1 knockdown reduced selinexor-induced cytotoxicity in both IM-9 (9.5-fold) and 8226 (12.3 to 25.4-fold) human MM cells. Intracellular protein analysis by heavy isotope labeling and LC-MS/MS showed changes in several signaling pathways including p53, MAPK, VEGF and angiopoietin, IL-1, HMGB1/TLR and APRIL and BAFF as well as those related to NFkB signaling. Conclusion: Selinexor, when used in combination with bortezomib or carfilzomib has the potential to overcome PI drug resistance in MM. Disclosures Kashyap: Pharma: Employment.
