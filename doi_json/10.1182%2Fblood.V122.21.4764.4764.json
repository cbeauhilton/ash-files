    "abstract_text": "Introduction Purified poloxamer188 (P188) (Mast Therapeutics) is a non-ionic, linear block copolymer composed of a central chain of hydrophobic polyoxypropylene and two flanking chains of hydrophylic polyoxyethylene (MW 8.5 kDa). This agent has hemorheologic properties which result in improved microvascular blood flow. P188 has been investigated in a number of indications and is currently under study in an international phase 3 clinical trial in sickle cell patients with vaso-occlusive crisis. Dextrans represent branched polysaccharides of 10-70 kDa that have been used as antithrombotic agents and plasma expanders. Sickle cell disease (SCD) represents a complex hemorheologic condition due to RBC aggregation and cell-fibrin/fibrinogen interactions. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is reflective of RBC and plasma interactions. This study was designed to compare the effect of P188 and dextrans on ESR\u2019s in blood obtained from healthy subjects and patients with sickle cell disease who were seen at Loyola University Medical Center clinics. Material and Methods Whole EDTA blood collected from normal individuals (n=8) and sickle cell patients confirmed by electrophoresis (n=11) were supplemented with P188 or dextran 10K, 18K , 40K and 70K at various concentrations (or saline control). ESR was measured using standard laboratory technique. Results The ESR\u2019s for sickle cell patients (26.4 \u00b1 7.1 mm/hr) were significantly higher in comparison to the ESR\u2019s for healthy subjects (14.6 \u00b1 2.1 mm/hr). Supplementation of P188 decreased ESR\u2019s in both populations. Normal blood ESR\u2019s decreased to 9.1 \u00b1 1.3 mm/hr (38%), whereas the sickle cell patient values decreased to 14.1 \u00b1 4.6 mm/hr (47%). \u00a0At comparable concentrations, none of the dextrans changed ESR\u2019s in healthy subjects or patients with sickle cell disease. Discussion These results demonstrate that ESR in SCD patients are elevated compared to healthy subjects. P188 supplementation decreased (up to 50%) ESR\u2019s in both the healthy subjects and sickle cell patients. This may be due to the inhibition of rouleaux formation resulting from P188 effects on RBC membranes or cell-protein interactions. None of the dextrans produced a similar decrease, suggesting that the observed lowering of ESR by P188 is unlikely to be due to a non-specific effect related to polymer molecular weight. Clinical Implications P188 is a potential therapeutic agent which may facilitate blood flow and reduce cell-fibrin/fibrinogen interactions in a variety of hemorrheologic disorders. The observed decrease in ESR both in normal and sickle cell blood samples by P188 may primarily be due to increased membrane hydration, fibrinogen dispersion and anti-adhesive effects of this agent.
