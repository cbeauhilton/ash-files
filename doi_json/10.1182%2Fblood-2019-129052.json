    "abstract_text": "Background: Although >90% of Burkitt Lymphoma (BL) patients will be cured by intensive multi-agent immunochemotherapy, relapsed and refractory BL patients have poor prognoses demonstrating the need to identify novel therapies. Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) is a pro-survival protein within the BCL-2 family that has been investigated as a therapeutic target in several leukemia and lymphoma pre-clinical models and clinical studies. Analysis of pediatric BL tumors has implicated MCL-1 in BL pathogenesis (Giulino-Roth et al., Blood 2012) and targeting MCL-1 may be effective in MYC-driven lymphomas (Kelly et al., Genes Dev 2014). High MCL-1 expression has also been associated with therapy resistance and can confer resistance to BH3 mimetic agents (Carrington et al., Cell Death Differ 2017). AMG176, a selective MCL-1 inhibitor, is an effective promoter of apoptosis and is currently under investigation in clinical trials for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that MCL-1 inhibition with AMG176 will promote apoptosis and increase sensitivity of BL therapy-sensitive (TSCL) and therapy-resistant (TRCL) cell lines to other chemotherapy drugs. Methods: A panel of TSCLs (Raji, Ramos and Daudi) and one TRCL (Raji 4RH) BL cell lines were exposed to increasing concentrations of AMG176 as a single agent and in combination with Doxorubicin or Venetoclax at different time points. Cell viability was analyzed using PrestoBlue. Synergy in drug combination exposures was determined by Calcusyn software and reported as a combination index (CI) value with values increasingly <1 indicating increasing synergistic activity . Apoptosis induction was analyzed by flow cytometry for Annexin V (AV) and Sytox-7AAD and by western blotting for PARP. Effects of MCL-1 inhibition on the expression of other pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family member proteins was assessed by western blotting. AMG176 mechanism(s) of action was evaluated by co-immunoprecipitation followed by western blotting for pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family members known to be bound by MCL-1. Results: Single agent AMG176 exposure of BL cell lines exhibited a dose and time-dependent decrease in viable cells. 48hr IC 50 values of Ramos (0.3097uM) and Raji (1.652uM) showed an increased sensitivity to AMG176 as compared to Daudi (9.616uM) and Raji 4RH (12.45uM). Exposure of cells to AMG176 also resulted in altered expression levels of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic proteins of the BCL-2 family proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation performed after 48hrs of AMG176 exposure exhibited a decrease in MCL-1:BIM and MCL-1:BAK complexes in Raji and Ramos cells promoting a pro-apoptotic environment. After 48hr exposure to AMG176, induction of apoptosis was observed in a dose-dependent manner in all cell lines as evidenced by increased PARP cleavage on western blot and AV-Sytox positivity on flow cytometry. To investigate the ability of MCL-1 inhibition to enhance the activity of cytotoxic chemotherapy, BL cells were exposed to AMG176 in combination with Doxorubicin. Daudi and Raji exhibited strong synergy with peak synergistic activity observed at 72hrs (Daudi CI values <0.1 at all AGM176 concentrations with 0.1-0.2uM Doxorubicin; Raji CI ranged from 0.233-0.295 at multiple AMG176 concentrations with <0.4uM Doxorubicin) while a minimal effect was observed in Ramos and Raji 4RH. As high MCL-1 is associated with resistance to Venetoclax by sequestering free BIM following Venetoclax exposure, the combination of AMG176 and Venetoclax was investigated and also showed significant synergy in BL cells. A minimal effect was observed in Daudi and Raji 4RH in Venetoclax combination but Ramos and Raji, the more AMG176 sensitive cell lines, showed peak synergy at 24hrs at high doses of Venetoclax (Ramos CI values ranged from 0.3-0.478; Raji CI ranged from 0.511 to 0.67). Conclusion: MCL-1 inhibition with AMG176 demonstrates dose- and time-dependent anti-lymphoma activity impairing in vitro proliferation and inducing apoptosis in BL cells. AMG176 exhibits synergistic activity in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in both therapy-sensitive and therapy-resistant BL cell lines and synergistically enhances response to the BH3 mimetic agent Venetoclax. These findings highlight the potential of MCL-1 inhibition as a therapeutic option in BL. This work was supported by T35 NIH training grant (T35AI089693).
