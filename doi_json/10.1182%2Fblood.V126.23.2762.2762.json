    "abstract_text": "Background: Interferon-alpha (IFN\u03b1) is a pleiotrophic cytokine with direct anti-tumor and immunostimulatory effects. Currently IFN\u03b1 is approved for the treatment of multiple hematologic malignancies, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). However, its clinical utility has been hindered by dose-limiting toxicitiy due to systemic activation of the interferon receptor. To overcome this limitation, we engineered anti-tumor antibody-IFN\u03b1 fusion proteins to selectively increase delivery of IFN to the tumor site and reduce systemic toxicity. We previously reported that IGN002, an anti-CD20-IFN\u03b1 fusion protein, exhibits enhanced complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) compared to rituximab, and inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of human B-cell NHL (Yamada et al , ASCO 2013). We now extend these previous findings and show that IGN002 possesses enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) effector function and superior in vivo anti-tumor activity against B-cell NHL, compared to rituximab. Methods: IGN002 was evaluated against a panel of human Burkitt and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines. Proliferation was measured by [ 3 H]-thymidine incorporation, STAT1 activation by flow cytometry, ADCC by lactate dehydrogenase release using human PBMC effectors, and IFN bioactivity by encephalomyocarditis (EMC) viral protection assay. NHL xenografts were grown in SCID mice. Results: IGN002 more potently inhibited the growth of NHL cell lines expressing CD20 than rituximab or unfused IFN\u03b1. Intrinsic IFN\u03b1 activity of IGN002 was reduced in viral protection and anti-proliferation assays using cells lacking CD20 expression. STAT1 activation by IGN002 was enhanced on cells expressing the target antigen, whereas a control antibody-IFN\u03b1 fusion protein showed reduced STAT activation activity compared to unfused IFN\u03b1. Together, these results indicate that fusion of IFN\u03b1 to the antibody results in reduced IFN effects on cells not bearing the tumor antigen target. IGN002 exhibited enhanced ADCC activity compared to rituximab against Daudi, Ramos, and Raji NHL cells in long-term (overnight incubation) assays, demonstrating both higher potency and higher maximal cytotoxicity. This result is possibly due to activation of the effector cell populations by the fused IFN\u03b1 moiety, as IFN is known to activate both NK cells and monocytes. The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of IGN002 was compared to rituximab and a control antibody-IFN\u03b1 fusion protein against 10-day established Raji NHL xenografts. IGN002 was superior to both rituximab and the control fusion protein, achieving a longer median survival and higher long-term survival rate (p = 0.0015 and < 0.0001 vs. rituximab and control fusion protein, respectively). The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of IGN002 was also compared to rituximab at three equimolar dose levels (5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, and 0.2 mg/kg antibody) against 10-day established Daudi NHL xenografts. IGN002 showed superior efficacy compared to rituximab at all doses (p < 0.001), achieving tumor eradication (100% long-term survival) in all mice treated at all three dose levels, whereas rituximab only delayed tumor progression. Conclusions: IGN002 demonstrated more robust direct anti-proliferative and antibody effector functions than rituximab against human NHL cells in vitro , and also showed the ability to eradicate established NHL xenografts in vivo. Against cells expressing the CD20 target antigen, IGN002 exhibited greater anti-proliferative potency than unfused IFN\u03b1. In contrast, the anti-proliferative and anti-viral potency of IGN002 was reduced against cells lacking CD20, compared to unfused IFN\u03b1. These findings support the hypothesis that tumor antigen-targeted IFN therapeutics may possess a broader therapeutic index than unfused IFN\u03b1, inhibiting tumor growth by multiple mechanisms while reducing systemic toxicity. These results support the further development of IGN002 for the treatment of B-cell NHL, and a first-in-human phase I clinical study will begin later this year in the United States.
