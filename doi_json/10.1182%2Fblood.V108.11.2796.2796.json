    "abstract_text": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a family of small RNA, each member of which can potentially regulate post-transcription gene expression in a temporal and tissue-specific manner. Each miRNA encodes a transcript of about 22 nucleotides that can modulate expression of specific target mRNA. We identified that the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells of a large proportion of patients have aberrant, low-level expression of two clustered miRNAs located at 13q14, designated miR-15a and miR-16\u20131, providing the first example of dysregulated miRNA expression in a human cancer ( PNAS USA  99 : 15524 , 2002 ). These miRNAs each have sequences that potentially could target mRNA encoding the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2, which is expressed at high levels in CLL. Transfection of a lymphoma B cell line lacking expression of miR-15a and miR-16\u20131 with an expression vector encoding miR-15a and miR-16\u20131, designated pmiR-15/16, attenuated the expression-level of bcl-2 protein and enhanced the susceptibility of such lymphoma B cells to apoptosis in vitro. However, it was not certain whether miR-15a and miR-16\u20131 could modulate expression of bcl-2 in primary leukemia cells that were not adapted for propagation in vitro. We selected primary CLL cell samples (n = 3) that harbored deletions at 13q14 and that lacked expression of miR-15a and miR-16\u20131, as assessed via microRNA array and quantitative RT-PCR analyses. We transfected these cells with pmiR-15/16 or a control vector via electroporation and, in parallel studies, also transfected these CLL cells with sense and antisense control oligo-RNAs via transmessenger transfection. Before and after such manipulations we monitored for expression of miR-15a and miR-16\u20131 by RT-PCR, for relative expression of BCL-2-family member transcripts using a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay, and for expression of bcl-2 protein using immunoblot analysis and flow cytometry. We found that CLL cells transfected with either pmiR15/16 or with miR-15a and miR-16\u20131 sense oligo-RNAs had increased expression-levels of miR-15a and miR-16\u20131 within 24 hours after transfection, whereas CLL transfected with the control vector or antisense oligo-RNA did not. Depite high-level expression of miR-15a and miR-16\u20131, the relative levels of BCL-2 transcript did not change over the 48 hours after transfection that we examined. However, in this time period we observed that CLL cells made to express miR-15a and miR-16\u20131, experienced significant reductions in the levels of bcl-2 protein, which were not observed in control transfected CLL cells. This is the first demonstration that miRNAs can effect post-transcriptional regulation of protein expression in a primary human tumor and suggest that miRNAs may have potential therapeutic utility in the modulation of pathogenic gene-expression in CLL and other cancers.",
