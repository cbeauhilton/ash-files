    "abstract_text": "RIPK1 has important kinase-dependent and kinase-independent scaffolding functions that prevent or activate necroptosis or apoptosis. Complete RIPK1 deficiency results in cell death and widespread inflammation yet tissue specific RIPK1 deletion can result in apoptosis, necroptosis and/or systemic inflammation, depending on the cell type. We have previously demonstrated that a hematopoietic RIPK1 deficiency results in constitutive activation of RIPK3 and MLKL and induction of necroptosis (Roderick et al, PNAS, 2014). These mice exhibit elevated serum TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 levels, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) loss, and ultimately succumb to bone marrow failure (BMF). When mice with a hematopoietic RIPK1 deficiency were placed on a RIPK3 deficient background, plasma pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels were reduced, HSPC numbers increased and BMF was significantly delayed. These mouse genetic data demonstrate that necroptotic death contributes to BMF in the mouse. To identify the receptor/ligands that trigger necroptosis, we generated mice with a hematopoietic RIPK1-deficiency on the Tnfr1 -/- and Tnfr1 -/- Tnfr2 -/- genetic backgrounds. An absence of TNF signaling failed to prevent necroptosis and consequently, vav-iCre Ripk1 f/f Tnfr1 -/- Tnfr2 -/- mice succumbed to BMF. Because type II interferons can also induce necroptosis, we generated vav-iCre Ripk1 f/f Ifngr1 -/- mice. These mice appear phenotypically normal demonstrating that an absence of IFN\u03b3 signaling prevents HSPC necroptosis and BMF.Collectively, these data may implicate IFN\u03b3-mediated, RIPK3-dependent necroptosis in human BMF syndromes and raise the intriguing possibility that the progressive HSPC elimination observed in these patients reflects in part, IFN\u03b3-induced necroptotic death.
