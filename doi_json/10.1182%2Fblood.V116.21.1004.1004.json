    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1004 Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type I (CDA1) is an inherited recessive macrocytic anemia associated with ineffective erythropoiesis. The disorder is characterized by the accumulation of erythroid precursors containing spongy heterochromatin and internuclear chromatin bridges. The mutated gene ( CDAN1 ) encodes an ubiquitously expressed protein (codanin-1) of unknown function. We have previously shown that codanin-1 is a direct transcriptional target of the E2F1 transcription factor and that the levels of codanin-1 increase during S-phase and decrease during mitosis. In an attempt to further define the role of codanin-1, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen using a human bone marrow library and found that codanin-1 binds to Asf1a. Asf1 (anti silencing function) is a H3/H4 histone chaperone involved in the chromatin structure dynamics by its role in nucleosome assembly and disassembly. Using coimmunoprecipitation experiments we confirmed that histone chaperone Asf1a is a direct binding partner of codanin-1. Minimal 100 amino acids domain of codanin-1, involved in binding Asf1, was identified and defined as the Asf1-binding domain. We found that codanin-1 binds to the conserved N-terminal core of Asf1a, where histones and other histone chaperones also bind. FLAG-tagged codanin-1 or its Asf1-binding domain immunoprecipitated from transfected Hela cells and subsequently coimmunoprecipitated histone H3 and Asf1a simultaneously. A pull-down assay of purified Asf1-binding domain in the presence of core histones showed, however, no direct binding of this domain of codanin-1 to H3/H4 histones. By using the replication-independent nucleosome formation assay we noticed that the nucleosome assembly activity of GST-Asf1a was severely decreased by the addition of the purified Asf1-binding domain of codanin-1, a phenotype similar to the one observed in Asf1 depletion. One possible explanation is that binding of codanin-1 inhibits dissociation of histones from Asf1a, which therefore cannot be deposited onto DNA. It will be of interest to determine if codanin-1 is involved in modulating Asf1a activity in vivo and also in response to DNA replication or damage and to determine its role in erythroid heterochromatin formation.
