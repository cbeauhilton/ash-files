    "abstract_text": "We present our extended experience with an only therapeutic platelet transfusion strategy in patients after autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation(ASCT). Clinically stable patients(fever < 38,5\u00b0Celsius, no local infections, no sepsis syndrome) received single donor apheresis platelet transfusions only in the case of bleeding WHO \u2265 II\u00b0, while prophylactic platelet transfusions were given to clinically instable patients if the morning platelet count was < 10/nl. In a first analysis after 50 patients we have shown that this strategy was safe, with no bleeding greater than WHO II\u00b0. In a retrospective matched-pair analysis the total number of platelet units transfused was reduced to 50% compared to our former strategy with routine platelet transfusions given when the morning platelet count was below 10/nl. (ASH 2002). We now analysed 106 patients with a total number of 140 ASCTs. Median age was 54 years(19\u201370): The diagnoses were acute leukemia(17), lymphoma(34), solid tumors(9) and multiple myeloma(46). The conditioning regimens corresponded to standard protocols. Median days of thrombocytopenia < 20/nl and 10/nl were 6(0\u201392) and 3(0\u201362) respectively, with a total number of days with thrombocytopenia <20/nl and <10/nl of 989 and 508. Hemorrhages WHO I\u00b0 and II\u00b0 was observed in only 49 out of 140(35%) ASCTs. We observed no bleeding greater than WHO II\u00b0. The median number of platelet units was 1(0\u201318). 48 out of 140(34%) transplantations could be performed without platelet transfusions. In multiple myeloma this percentage was even higher: 32/68(47%). The indications for prophylactic transfusions were mainly FUO(21/61 \u2013 34%) and mucositis with or without fever(19/61\u201331%). Considering age below or above the median age of 54 years or different diagnoses, there was no difference in days with platelets <10/nl, <20/nl, bleeding complications or median number of platelet units transfused. The total number of 234 transfusions in these 140 transplantations could have been even further reduced, because 15%(36/234) of the transfusions were given without a clear indication regarding the study regimen, because of a learning effect with this new strategy. This new strategy has shown to be very safe and prophylactic platetelet tansfusions are probably not necessary in clinically stable patients with fever as the only sign of an infection. We are just starting a multicenter randomised study comparing this new strategy with the former strategy of routine prophylactic platelet transfusion.",
