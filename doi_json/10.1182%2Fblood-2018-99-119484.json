    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Unprecedented clinical outcomes were reported after CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CART19) therapy and led to their FDA approval in diffuse large B cell lymphoma and in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the complete response rate in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) after CART19 therapy is much lower, at approximately 20-30%, and the mechanism(s) for this relative lack of success is unclear. The dominant known mechanism(s) that prevent successful CART cell therapy in CLL have been limited to CART expansion and poor persistence. However, potential mechanisms are not limited to the CLL T-cell. Several immune defects have been identified in CLL that result from the complex bi-directional interaction between B-CLL cells and their microenvironment. In CLL the leukemic microenvironment is rich with extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by B-CLL cells. There is growing evidence that these vesicles play an important role in intracellular communication by the delivery of growth factors, genetic material and microenvironmentally relevant molecules. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role and interactions of EVs in the diminished or absent CART response seen in some CLL patients. Methods: EVs were isolated from peripheral blood of 16 patients with untreated CLL at different Rai stages (8 patients had early and 8 had advanced stage disease) and risk profile by FISH (8 patients had low risk and 8 patients had high risk disease, based on the presence of 17p deletion). Cytometry was used to determine size, number of particles per \u00b5l, Annexin V and CD19 expression. These variables were correlated to the Rai stage and risk category of the disease. To investigate the impact of EVs on CART cell functions, CART19 cells were stimulated with either CLL EVs alone or in combination with the CD19 positive cell line JeKo1. After coincubation different effector functions were analysed. Results: Two patterns of EVs in CLL patients were identified; a single versus two distinct EV size populations (small [EVs small ]; 50-240nm, median=110nm) and large [EVs large ]; 180-560nm, median = 360nm Fig 1.A). In 25% of patients, EVs were CD19 positive (EV CD19+ ). CD19 positivity was detected only in patients with the EVs large (Fig 1.B). The EVs concentration, CD19 expression (EVs CD19+ vs EVs CD19- ), or the size (EVs small vs EVs large ) did not correlate with disease stage (early vs advanced Rai stage) or risk profile of CLL (low vs high risk) although some variation could be seen (Fig 1.C). To investigate our hypothesis that EVs could modulate CART19 function, CART19 cell effector functions were examined in the presence of EVs CD19+ , EVs CD19- , EVs small , or EVs large . EVs, 1.5x10e5 particles, alone were insufficient to stimulate CART19 cells. However when CART19 cells were stimulated with the CD19 positive cell line JeKo1, their effector functions were reduced only in the presence of EVs CD19+ , 50,000 particles, 2.5 x 10e3/ \u00b5l, but not EVs CD19- at the same concentration. This included a significant reduction in CART specific killing (Fig 1.D) and a reduction in cytokine production. The impairment of CART cell functions was independent of the size of EVs, i.e. there was no impairment of CART functions with large or small size EV CD19- in co-culture. Summary: We identify CD19 positive large size EVs from patients with CLL and demonstrate that these EVs play a role in the leukemic microenvironment by reducing CART cell activity. Studies are ongoing to define the mechanism(s).
