    "abstract_text": "# Contributed equally \u03b1V\u03b23 has been implicated in the pathophysiology of important disorders, including osteoporosis, sickle cell disease, tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, virus invasion, glomerulonephritis, dermal and hepatic fibrosis, acute myelogenous leukemia, supravalvular aortic stenosis, bowel strictures, and T-cell lymphoma, but no \u03b1V\u03b23 antagonists have been approved for human therapy. The RGD-based \u03b1V\u03b23 antagonist MK-0429 (MK429) had favorable results in osteoporosis patients in Phase 2, but was not advanced, and the RGD-based antagonist cilengitide was studied in patients with malignancies, but did not demonstrate efficacy. Since RGD-based antagonists can under certain circumstances activate \u03b1V\u03b23, prime it to bind ligand, induce apoptosis, increase tumor angiogenesis and growth, and increase hepatic fibrosis, we sought to develop a pure \u03b1V\u03b23 antagonist that does not induce high affinity ligand binding or exposure of the epitope for mAb AP5, both of which depend on the swing-out of the \u03b23 PSI domain. We built on Arnaout's group's studies of a variant fibronectin fragment with high affinity for \u03b1V\u03b23 (hFN10) that did not induce the \u03b23 swing-out motion because a Trp substitution on the ligand formed a \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction with \u03b23 Y122 on the \u03b21-\u03b11 loop, thus preventing the latter's movement toward the MIDAS, which is the trigger for \u03b23 swing-out. To develop a small-molecule that mimics the effect of hFN10, we used inferences from a predicted docking pose of MK429 into the hFN10 binding site of the \u03b1V\u03b23 crystal structure to rationally design a compound with an aromatic ring that directly engages \u03b23 Y122. Based on the results of molecular dynamics simulations, the aromatic group of this compound, TDI-4161, is only 4.4 \u00c5 from Y122 (and forms a \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction), which compares with 4.7 \u00c5 for hFN10 and 7.0 \u00c5 for MK429 (which does not form a \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction). We analyzed compounds in 2 assays: 1. Adhesion of HEK293 cells expressing human \u03b1V\u03b23 (HEK-\u03b1V\u03b23) to fibrinogen (reported as the concentration producing 50% inhibition; IC 50 ). 2. Exposure of the epitope for mAb AP5 (the concentration producing 50% exposure; EC 50 ). The racemate of MK429 (rMK429) has an IC 50 =0.0036 \u00b5M and an EC 50 =0.019 \u00b5M, and cilengitide has an IC 50 =0.050 \u00b5M and an EC 50 =0.034 \u00b5M, indicating that both are potent \u03b1V\u03b23 antagonists and potent inducers of the \u03b1V\u03b23 active conformation. In sharp contrast, TDI-4161 has an IC 50 =0.022 \u00b5M and an EC 50 >10 \u00b5M, indicating that it does not induce the \u03b23 conformational change even at 400X the IC 50 . TDI-4161 inhibited the binding of: purified \u03b1V\u03b23 to adenovirus 2 penton base (IC 50 = 0.028 \u00b5M) and purified \u03b1V\u03b25 to vitronectin (IC 50 =2.09 \u00b5M), but not purified \u03b1V\u03b26 to TGF-\u03b21 Latency Associated Peptide even at 10 \u00b5M. TDI-4161inhibited adhesion of mouse endothelial cells containing murine \u03b1V\u03b23 to fibrinogen (IC 50 = 0.437 \u00b5M). We tested TDI-4161's ability to 'prime\" \u03b1V\u03b23 by: incubating it with HEK-\u03b1V\u03b23 at 10 \u00b5M, fixing the cells with paraformaldehyde, washing, incubating with fluorescent fibrinogen, and measuring bound fibrinogen by flow cytometry. The peptide RGDS (100 \u00b5M) increased fibrinogen binding from 8.7 \u00b1 1.5 to 24.3 \u00b1 1.4 GMFI (p <0.001; n=3), but TDI-4161 did not (7.0 \u00b1 2.6 GMFI; p<0.001 vs RGDS). After oral administration of TDI-4161 to mice at 100 mg/kg, the Cmax was 7.5 \u00b5M at the Tmax of 0.94 hours; the T 1/2 was 3.6 hours. Once-daily oral dosing of TDI-4161 for 28 days at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg was well tolerated in male CD-1 mice (n=3). Day 1 and day 28 plasma levels 1 hour after dosing were similar. We tested the effect of TDI-4161 on osteoclast function by adding it at 10 \u00b5M (0.1% DMSO) to bone marrow-derived murine macrophages and cultured them either on plastic or bovine bone slices with RANKL and a source of M-CSF. After 5 days, cells incubated with TDI-4161 demonstrated an osteoclast phenotype similar to that of \u03b23 null mice; osteoclast numbers were better preserved than with rMK429, but less well than with the DMSO control. Supernatants from bone slices were assayed for cross-linked collagen degradation products (CrossLaps). When compared to the DMSO control (32.7 nM), rMK429 (10 \u00b5M) produced 82% inhibition (5.9 nM) and TDI-4161 produced 74% inhibition (8.3 nM). In summary, using inferences from structural data derived from hFN10, we have synthesized an orally bioavailable pure \u03b1V\u03b23 antagonist that reacts with both human and murine \u03b1V\u03b23, does not prime \u03b1V\u03b23 to bind fibrinogen, and inhibits osteoclast bone resorption.
