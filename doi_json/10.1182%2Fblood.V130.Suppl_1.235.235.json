    "abstract_text": "As currently understood, activated factor VII is the initiating protease of the coagulation process. The identity of the protease(s) that cleaves factor VII to yield its circulating activated form (~1% of the total factor VII protein in normal individuals) remains uncertain. Although, measurement of plasma concentrations of factor VIIa in normal human subjects and those with specific factor deficiencies suggests that factor IX has a factor VIII-independent role in generating circulating factor VIIa ( Blood 80 :25-28, 1992). Previous work using purified plasma proteins yielded evidence that factor IX cleaved only at residue R226 (factor IXa\u03b1) was a competent protease, yet did not efficiently bind factor VIIIa ( JBC 23 :14484-14490, 1995). We investigated whether this form of factor IX might activate factor VII, as it seems to have the appropriate characteristics (proteolytic activity that is VIIIa independent). We created and purified recombinant mutant forms of factor IX and factor VII that enabled exploration of the functions of these separate cleavages without the complication of unanticipated proteolysis that is inherent when using plasma derived proteins. Wild-type factor IX and R191H factor IX (the Hemophilia B Chapel Hill variant) were activated to yield factor IXa\u03b2 and IXa\u03b1, respectively, as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions, and incorporation of fluoresceinated EGR-chloromethyl ketone into the active sites, confirming that activity correlated with the appropriate molecular mass subunit. As predicted, factor IXa\u03b2 and R191H IXa\u03b1 demonstrated identical catalytic efficiency in the amidolytic cleavage of a small molecular weight substrate, Pefachrome IXa. In contrast, in the presence of factor VIIIa-phospholipid, compared to factor IXa\u03b2, R191H IXa\u03b1 exhibited greatly reduced ability to cleave the physiologic macromolecular substrate, factor X. Consistent with previous findings, R191H factor IXa\u03b1 had appreciably lower affinity for factor VIIIa than did factor IXa\u03b2, and this likely explains the difference in factor X activating activity. This difference in activity was also seen in a plasma-based system, where R191H factor IXa\u03b1 demonstrated only 1.6% of the coagulant activity of factor IXa\u03b2 in an aPTT assay in factor IX immunodepleted plasma. There was a distinct difference with a second physiologic macromolecular substrate. Factor R191H factor IXa\u03b1 and factor IXa\u03b2 activated factor VII to VIIa with identical kinetic parameters in a purified system. Intriguingly, the addition of factor VIIIa did not change the kinetic parameters of factor VII activation by either form of factor IXa. This observation is unlikely to be due to factor VIIa contaminating the factor VII preparation, as catalytically incompetent factor VII (S344A) was cleaved at indistinguishable rates by factors R191H IXa\u03b1 and IXa\u03b2. Experiments with control proteins that also contained mutations at the active site, showed that factor IX R191Q;S411A demonstrated the appropriate sized bands on SDS-PAGE for factor IXa\u03b1, but did not incorporate fluoresceinated EGR-chloromethyl ketone, and had no detectable amidolytic, proteolytic, or coagulant activity, consistent with the active site serine mutation. Factor IX R191Q;R226Q was not cleaved by factor VIIa-tissue factor, and factor IX R226Q was cleaved to subunits consistent with factor IX\u03b1. Neither of these proteins incorporated fluoresceinated EGR-chloromethyl ketone, and neither demonstrated detectable amidolytic activity. These experiments with recombinant forms of factor IX support the hypothesis that factor IXa\u03b1 exhibits active site enzymatic competency equal to factor IXa\u03b2, and that cleavage at R191 is required to generate fully competent factor VIIIa binding determinants. Moreover, factor IXa\u03b1 and factor IXa\u03b2 are fully competent to activate factor VII, without influence by factor VIIIa. Given this mechanistic demonstration and the previously noted clinical observations (Blood 80 :25-28, 1992), we propose that activated forms of factor IX are responsible for generating circulating plasma factor VIIa, which is available for the initiation phase of coagulation. These data suggest that activated factor IX is as plausible a candidate for the initiating protease of the coagulation cascade as is activated factor VII .
