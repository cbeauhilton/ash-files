    "abstract_text": "Introduction von Willebrand disease (VWD) causes mild to severe bleeding, typically following trauma or surgical intervention. These episodes require treatment with a von Willebrand factor (VWF) containing concentrate; at present the only available concentrates are plasma derived. UK guidelines recommend using concentrates manufactured to the highest standards to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission. Methods Wilate\u00ae (Octapharma AG, Switzerland) is a dual virally inactivated FVIII/VWF concentrate available in the UK since 2007. Use of Wilate\u00ae between 2007 and 2012, including a period of product switching was evaluated in two large haemophilia centres (adult and paediatric). The primary study end-point was efficacy of concentrate usage for the treatment of bleeding and surgery. Efficacy was graded using 4 point ordinal scales that rated efficacy as; excellent, good, moderate or nil. Secondary end points were the occurrence of adverse events (immune, infective or thrombotic) and evidence of response on laboratory parameters. Results Between 01/03/07 and 01/05/12 a total of 4,565,450IU of Wilate\u00ae were used with data evaluable for 4,125,800IU (90.4%). Eighty two patients (44 male, 38 female) including 33 children (< 18yrs) and 49 adults (\u226518yrs) with type 1 (n=29), type 2 (n=34), type 3 diseases (n=16) and acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS) (n=3) were treated. The median age at first treatment was 22.7 yrs (range 0.01- 82.3). The mean recoveries \u00b1 SD, following first dose in adults (n=35) were FVIII:C 2.25 \u00b1 0.65; VWF:Ag 2.4 \u00b1 0.70 and VWF:RCo 1.91 \u00b1 0.53. Fifty three patients (20 < 18yr, 33 \u2265 18yr) received concentrate for 93 surgical interventions (36 major, 36 minor, 21 dental procedures). This included 22 patients with type 1, 22 type 2, 7 type 3 disease and 2 with AVWS. The median loading dose prior to surgery was 2700IU (range 450-7200) corresponding to 43.1IU/kg (range 11.84-125). Surgical procedures were covered with a median of 1 treatment (range 1-13) over a median of 1 day (range 1 \u2013 12). Thirty surgical episodes required \u22652 doses (27 major, 3 minor) with a median second dose of 1800IU (range 450-4500) corresponding to 36.4IU/kg (range 17.9-78.6). Overall efficacy was rated as excellent in 89.2% (n=83), good in 5.4% (n=5), moderate in 4.3% (n=4) and nil in 1.1% (n=1). Thirty five patients (13 < 18yr, 22 \u2265 18yr) were treated for 80 non-surgical episodes of bleeding or trauma (37 major, 43 minor). This included 10 patients with type 1, 14 type 2, 10 type 3 disease and 1 with AVWS. The median first dose given was 2475 IU (range 250-7200) corresponding to 45.7 IU/kg (range 11.8- 97.8). Bleeding episodes were treated with a median of 2 treatments (range 1-80) over a median of 2 treatment days (range 1-78). Forty-three episodes required \u22652 doses (36 major, 7 minor) with a median follow-up dose of 2700IU (range 250-8100) corresponding to 39.3IU/kg (range 11.8-95.7). Overall efficacy was rated as being excellent in 87.5% (n=70), good in 10.0% (n=8), moderate in 2.5% (n=2) and nil in 0.0% (n=0). Nine patients (1 < 18yr, 8 \u2265 18yr) were on home treatment regimens using 2,644,200 IU of Wilate\u00ae (64.1% total usage). These patients were treated using either on-demand (n=3), regular prophylaxis (n=5) or targeted prophylaxis (n=1). Two patients on prophylaxis switched to Wilate\u00ae within the study period with similar efficacy to the previous six months of treatment. Twelve patients were treated for other indications not covered by these categories. Wilate\u00ae was used to cover 3 un-complicated deliveries (1 operative and 2 vaginal deliveries). There were 8 reported adverse events (8 patients), with 4 requiring medical review although not requiring in-patient treatment. One patient had treatment failure (impaired VWF:Ag recovery) on one treatment episode, and has been successfully re-treated. Five patients were re-challenged with only one having a repeat mild reaction. Five patients switched to an alternative product at the discretion of the patient/physician. No accumulation of FVIII was seen in patients treated for \u22653 days (mean change in FVIII:C trough level (first to last) +31.89iu/dl (-124.4 - +116.6)). No thrombosis, TTI or inhibitory antibodies were reported. Conclusion Wilate\u00ae was efficacious (excellent or good efficacy in > 94%), safe and well tolerated in this heterogeneous group of 82 patients with VWD. Bleed resolution or prevention was 100% with no accumulation of FVIII seen. Disclosures: Batty: Octapharma: Research Funding, Travel and conference registration fees Other.
