    "abstract_text": "As immunotherapies become increasingly important in the treatment of various cancers, monitoring the immune response to reflect the efficacy of the therapy also becomes increasingly important. Previously, tumor antigen-specific humoral responses in patients receiving vaccines for low-grade follicular lymphoma (FL) correlated with clinical outcomes, including tumor regression, molecular remission, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). By contrast, T cell immune responses have been difficult to validate. T cell proliferation assays, mostly, measure CD4 T cell responses; whereas, CD8 T cells may be the important effectors generated by immunotherapies. However, assays designed to measure CD8 T cells, i.e. chromium release CTL assays, and IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT and intracellular flow cytometry assays, are difficult to make reproducible. To address this issue, PBL were obtained from FL patients, cryopreserved, and thawed, then used to design a standardized method for detection of intracellular IFN-\u03b3 by flow cytometry. The combined stimulus of soluble anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies provides a robust stimulation, typically about 5% of normal PBL CD8+ T cells respond. By using a panel of irradiated B cell lymphoma cell lines as stimulators, we demonstrated that, on average, 1 \u2013 2% of these T cells were capable of mounting a response in this assay. Surprisingly, CD8+ PBL T cells from several patients with FL were more responsive to combined anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation as well as to allo-stimulation, 15 \u2013 22% and 2 \u2013 6%, respectively. This response was accompanied by surface expression of CD107, a surrogate marker for CTL degranulation, in the same population of cells as demonstrated by multi-color flow cytometry. Both the IFN-\u03b3 and the CD107 responses were inhibited by an anti-class I antibody, W6/32, suggesting a class I restricted T cell receptor-mediated response. Furthermore, at later time points, these T cells also up-regulated CD137 on their surface. This activation molecule is upregulated on CD8 T cells in response to specific antigen recognition and provides an anti-apoptotic signal to the cells. In conclusion, immune competency of CD8 T cells isolated from FL patients can be assessed through allo-stimulation by a panel of B cell lymphoma cell lines. More importantly, correlation by flow cytometry of 3 independent indicators of response (IFN-\u03b3, CD107 and CD137) within single populations of cells to both allo-stimulation and to the specific target, may lead to better understanding of the role of T cells in the immune response. Ultimately, these responses will need to be validated with patient outcomes in clinical trials of vaccines in lymphoma.",
