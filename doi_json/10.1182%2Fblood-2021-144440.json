    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION Patients with high-risk aggressive B-cell lymphoma exhibit poor survival after R-CHOP-like immunochemotherapy. More intensive regimens yield higher rates of remission but also of complication, which have hindered their use, particularly in older patients. At Karolinska, the standard intensive regimen has been R-Hyper-CVAD/R-MA for patients with high-risk characteristics, such as high age-adjusted international prognostic index (aaIPI) and extranodal disease. METHODS In this analysis, high-risk disease was defined as aaIPI \u2265 2 or any extranodal involvement. We examined Karolinska's 136 patients who received at least one cycle of R-Hyper-CVAD/R-MA in first-line therapy for high-risk disease, excluding Burkitt, transformed, and primary CNS lymphoma. Patients were diagnosed between 2006 and 2020; 89 were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 23 high-grade B-cell lymphoma, 17 primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, 4 T cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma, 2 aggressive B-cell lymphoma unspecified, 1 lymphomatoid granulomatosis grade 3. For outcome, we investigated progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS In this cohort of 136 patients with high-risk disease treated with at least one cycle of R-Hyper-CVAD/R-MA, the median age was 52 years (range, 19-69); 36 patients (26%) were 61-69 years old. Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated in 92%, stage III-IV disease was seen in 93%, WHO performance status \u22652 in 49%, aaIPI = 3 in 38%, extranodal disease in 30%, CNS involvement in 17%, and Charlson comorbidity index \u22652 in 11%. At 5 years, the PFS in all patients was 72% and in the 50 patients with aaIPI = 3, 66% (Figure 1). In patients \u226460 years old, 5-year PFS was 76% (aaIPI = 3, 69%). In patients 61-69 years, the 5-year PFS was 58% (aaIPI = 3, 59%). Six out of 136 patients (4%) died from toxicity during induction therapy (3/6 were 61-69 years old). CONCLUSIONS This is to our knowledge the largest published single-center series of patients treated with R-Hyper-CVAD/R-MA for high-risk aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Outcome in these patients aged 19-69 years was excellent, with 5-year PFS 72%. Particularly patients with aaIPI = 3 showed rather good outcome with 5-year PFS 66%. For comparison, in Sweden the 5-year overall survival of R-CHOP-treated patients \u226460 years with aaIPI = 3 is 40% (Mel\u00e9n CM et al. Brit J Haematol. 614-622. 2016). We will continue to explore R-Hyper-CVAD/R-MA as primary therapy for high-risk aggressive B-cell lymphoma.
