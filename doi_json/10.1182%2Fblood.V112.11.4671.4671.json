    "abstract_text": "Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal stem cell disease, characterised by intravascular hemolysis, bone marrow failure and lifethreatening thromboses. The median survival is 10\u201315 years, with the average age of presentation being in the 30\u2019s. Symptoms include hemoglobinuria, fatigue, anemia, venous and arterial thromboses, recurrent pain, renal impairment, erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. The care of a patient with PNH is complex and challenging, as many experience chronic symptoms with periods of acute exacerbations. Historically the management of PNH included bone marrow transplant, blood transfusion and administration of additional supportive therapies, all necessitating regular visits to the hospital. Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the C5 complement component inhibiting the activity of terminal complement and thus preventing the destruction of red blood cells has dramatically altered the management of hemolytic PNH. Clinical trials of eculizumab demonstrated the resolution of the majority of symptoms and complications of PNH and resulted in its approval in the UK in June 2007. Eculizumab is administered as a 30 minute intravenous infusion every 14 days, and under the terms of its current EU licence, must be administered by a healthcare professional. In view of the rarity of PNH there are relatively few specialist Centres for the disease resulting in, patients travelling long distances for review and treatment. In view of the dramatic improvement in symptoms on eculizumab many patients are able to return to a near normal lifestyle. In the UK, Leeds Teaching Hospitals with Healthcare at Home have developed a home infusion programme that ensures safe administration of eculizumab in the patient\u2019s home at a time convenient to them, leading to enhanced treatment-associated convenience for patients and their families. Patients then only attend the PNH Centre every 3 months to ensure appropriate monitoring and patient education. A recent survey of patients reports a reduction in treatment-associated burden for PNH patients and their families when receiving infusions at home. 46 patients responded to the survey with just over half receiving eculizumab. Of the 21 patients at the time receiving home infusions 19 found this more convenient than the hospital. Home treatment allows flexibility and for some, the return to full-time employment, with the associated financial benefits and improvement in psychological well-being. Of the 21 patients on home care 7 stated there ability to work was transformed with a further 10 having great improvement. Whilst the purpose of the survey was not to address financial burden, the home infusion programme has anecdotally reduced the financial burden on the patient and their family by eliminating the need for time off work, allowing return to full-time employment, and eliminating the cost of travel to and from the hospital for treatments. No patients reporting negative impact, including effect on social life and family relationships, whilst 15 experienced improvement or complete transformation in both areas. The patients reported confidence in the homecare programme, knowing that a very close working relationship existed between the expert hospital and homecare teams. This innovative programme of medication delivery by a dedicated home nursing team allows patients who have previously struggled to cope with their illness to lead a near normal life with an associated enhancement in quality of life. Patients are able to carry on with activities of daily life, including work, recreational activities and holidays, whilst at the same time ensuring compliance with treatment and therefore allowing maximum therapeutic benefit.",
