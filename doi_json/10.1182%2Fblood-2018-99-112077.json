    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Despite therapeutic advances, most patients (pts) with multiple myeloma (MM) eventually develop relapsed/refractory (RR) disease, and observational studies of pts refractory to immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors have demonstrated a median overall survival (OS) of 13 mo (Kumar et al, Leukemia 2017;31:2443-8). Elotuzumab, an immunostimulatory monoclonal antibody targeted to SLAMF7, directly activates natural killer cells and mediates the killing of MM cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. Elotuzumab, combined with lenalidomide (len) and dexamethasone (dex), is indicated in the USA and EU for RRMM in pts who have received \u22651 prior therapy. Pomalidomide (pom), a 2nd-generation immunomodulatory drug, appears to synergize with elotuzumab. The phase 2, randomized, international, exploratory ELOQUENT-3 study (NCT02654132) assessed elotuzumab combined with pom and dex (EPd) vs pom and dex (Pd); after a minimum follow-up of 9 mo, median progression-free survival (PFS) with EPd was 10.3 vs 4.7 mo with Pd (hazard ratio=0.54) and the overall response rate (ORR) was 53% vs 26% (Dimopoulos et al, EHA 2018 [LB2606]). In this supportive study, with a minimum follow-up of 16 mo, we present initial efficacy and safety data for EPd in pts with relapsed and/or refractory MM. Methods : This phase 2, multicenter, non-comparative study (NCT02612779) enrolled pts \u226518 y of age with MM who were relapsed, refractory, or intolerant to len (received for \u22652 consecutive cycles), 1-2 prior therapies, disease progression during or after their last therapy, and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of \u22642. Prior pom was not permitted. Pts received elotuzumab 10 mg/kg IV weekly for the first two 28-d cycles and 20 mg/kg IV every 4 wk thereafter. Pom 4 mg orally was given on Days 1-21 of each cycle and dex 40 or 20 mg oral equivalent was given weekly for pts \u226475 or >75 y of age, respectively. Primary endpoint was PFS; additional endpoints included OS, ORR, and safety. Results : At database lock (Apr 4, 2018), 68 pts had received EPd. At baseline, median age was 67 y, 35 pts (51%) were male, and 21 (31%) had International Staging System stage II-III disease. Median (range) prior number of therapies was 2 (1-5) and 34 pts (50%) were relapsed and refractory to their most recent therapy; 6 pts had received \u22653 prior therapies. Prior therapies included len (n=68, 100%), bortezomib (n=59, 87%), cyclophosphamide (n=20, 29%), carfilzomib (n=14, 21%), and autologous stem cell transplantation (n=38, 56%). At analysis, pts had received a median of 9 cycles of EPd and 13 (19%) were still on treatment. The most common reasons for discontinuation were disease progression (n=26, 38%) and maximum clinical benefit (n=10, 15%). Median PFS was 11.1 mo ( Figure ) and ORR was 51%. Overall, 9 pts (13%) achieved very good partial response or better, 26 (38%) achieved partial response, and 12 (18%) achieved minimal response. Median (95% CI) duration of response was 16.7 (11.3, not estimable [NE]) mo. Median time to first response was 1 mo, and to best response was 2.8 mo. Median (95% CI) OS was 22.4 (21.8, NE) mo. Pts with \u22652 prior therapies had a median (95% CI) PFS of 11.1 (5.6, 15.0) mo and an ORR of 46%. The most frequent all-cause non-hematologic adverse events (AEs) were fatigue (n=37, 54%), diarrhea (n=23, 34%), and upper respiratory tract infection (n=23, 34%); all-cause infections were reported in 47 pts (69%). No second primary malignancies were reported. The most common all-cause hematologic AE was neutropenia, reported in 24 pts (35%) and grade 3-4 in 11 (16%). Anemia was reported in 15 pts (22%) and was grade 3-4 in 4 (6%). Infusion reactions were reported in 5 pts (7%), all grade 1-2. In total, 7 pts (10%) experienced grade 5 AEs, 1 of which (pulmonary sepsis) was considered related to treatment. Overall, 11 pts (16%) experienced AEs leading to discontinuation. Conclusions : EPd was associated with a median PFS of 11.1 mo and ORR of 51% in pts with RRMM. Safety was consistent with prior reports of elotuzumab and pom, with no new safety signals. These data, coupled with findings from the randomized ELOQUENT-3 study, support EPd as a new, effective treatment option for pts with RRMM. Study support: BMS.
