    "abstract_text": "Platelets are critical in normal haemostasis and arterial thrombosis. As a potent activator, thrombin activates human platelets by cleavage of the protease-activated receptors PARs, exposing new amino terminus which serve as tethered peptide ligands, binding to the receptors induce transmembrane signaling. Thrombin also binds to platelet glycoprotein Ib, whose redistribution within platelet was showed to be reversible upon to thrombin or to PAR1 and PAR4 peptides. In an attempt to understand the reversible expression of platelet GPIb and cytoskeleton reorganization during platelet activation, then determine functions of thrombin receptors in GPIb redistribution. we used peptide SFLLRNPNDKYEPF (PAR1-AP, trap) and AYPGKF (PAR4-AP) for stimulating platelet at different time points (0~60minute), detected the platelet surface GPIb\u03b1 and P-selectin with flowcytometry, and compared the alteration of GPIb\u03b1, actin and myosin in cytoskeleton by western-blot, then analyzed the membrane cytoskeleton followed by GPIb\u03b1 immunoprecipitation. As expected, a reversible interalisation of GPIb\u03b1 was obtained by PAR1 or PAR4 activation, and a transient change of actin, myosin and GPIb\u03b1 /myosin GPIb\u03b1 /actin association were also found in this course. These transient internalisations were apparently blocked by Cytochalasin D (inhibitor of actin polymerisation) or BAPTA/AM (calcium chelator). At the same time, ApyraseVII had weak effect on GPIb\u03b1 interalisation, although the return of GPIb\u03b1 to platelet surface was accelerated by this low ATP/ADPase, which quickened GPIb\u03b1 dissappearance in cytoskeleton and the dissociation of GPIb/myosin or GPIb/actin during PAR1-AP activation.100nM and 10\u03bcM wortmannin were used to inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and/or myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in our experiments. In response to both PARs activation, GPIb\u03b1 interalisation was partly inhibited by 100nM wortmannin but little change for 10\u03bcM wortmannin, and a delayed restoration of surface GPIb\u03b1 was observed in the presence of 10\u03bcM wortmannin upon PAR1-AP activation.. Apart from the above reagents, Ro-31-2220 (inhibitor of protein kinase C) induced a decreased GPIb\u03b1 centralisation in response to PAR1 activation, and blocked the pool of GPIb\u03b1 inside platelet in the latter course of PAR4 activation (p<0.05 at 10,30 min). Globally, Our study confirmed that thrombin receptors are important for platelet signal transmission, Stimulation of either receptor is sufficient to trigger platelet activation and induce GP Ib redistribution, which is correlated with cytoskeleton reorganisation, depending on the actin polymerisation and calcium mobilisation and implicate both myosin and actin. Our results also suggested critical roles of ADP, PI3-K or protein kinase C (PKC) in the GPIb redistribution.",
