    "abstract_text": "Abstract 42 Background: Hemophilia A is treated by intravenous replacement therapy with factor VIII (FVIII), either on demand to resolve bleeding or as a prophylactic to prevent bleeding. Recently, routine prophylactic treatment is recommended to effectively prevent bleeding and to reduce bleeding-related chronic joint damage. However, the need for frequent intravenous injections of FVIII negatively affects patients' quality of life and their adherence to the routine prophylactic regimen. More importantly, approximately 30% of severe hemophilia A patients develop inhibitory antibodies toward the injected FVIII, rendering the replacement therapy ineffective. To overcome these drawbacks, we generated a bispecific antibody (termed ACE910) against activated factor IX (FIXa) and factor X (FX), which mimics the cofactor function of FVIII. Objectives: The aims of the present study were to examine the FVIII-mimetic cofactor activity of ACE910 in vitro and its hemostatic activity in vivo . Methods: The FVIII-mimetic cofactor activity of ACE910 was evaluated by a thrombin generation assay in human FVIII-deficient plasma as well as by an enzymatic assay using purified coagulation factors. For in vivo studies, an acquired hemophilia A model was established in cynomolgus monkeys by a single intravenous injection of mouse monoclonal anti-FVIII neutralizing antibody, which was cross-reactive to cynomolgus monkey FVIII but not to porcine FVIII. After artificial bleeding had been induced, ACE910 or porcine FVIII was intravenously administered in a single dose or in twice-daily repeated doses, respectively. Bleeding symptoms, including anemia and skin bruising, were monitored for three days. A pharmacokinetic study of ACE910 was also performed with a single intravenous or subcutaneous administration to cynomolgus monkeys. Results: ACE910 concentration-dependently showed FVIII-mimetic cofactor activity in the enzymatic assay and improved thrombin generation parameters in human FVIII-deficient plasma. Intravenous administration of ACE910 (a single dose of 3 mg/kg) significantly reduced the bleeding symptoms in the acquired hemophilia A model of a non-human primate. This hemostatic effect was comparable to twice-daily intravenous administration of porcine FVIII (repeated doses of 10 U/kg). The half-life of ACE910 was approximately three weeks for both single intravenous and subcutaneous administrations. The subcutaneous bioavailability of ACE910 was nearly 100%. Conclusion: The bispecific antibody against FIXa and FX, ACE910, exerted FVIII-mimetic cofactor activity in vitro . Furthermore, a single dose of ACE910 demonstrated hemostatic activity comparable to twice-daily repeated doses of 10 U/kg porcine FVIII in vivo . Moreover, ACE910 exhibited high subcutaneous bioavailability and approximately three-week half-life in a non-human primate. Our bispecific antibody against FIXa and FX is a subcutaneously injectable, long-acting agent that removes the need to consider the induction or presence of FVIII inhibitors and may establish a novel principle for the prophylactic treatment of hemophilia A patients.
