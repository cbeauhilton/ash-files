    "abstract_text": "Background In multiple myeloma (MM) mouse models, diseased animals demonstrate a marked expansion of areas of hypoxia in the bone marrow, suggesting that hypoxia may be a therapeutically meaningful target in this disease. TH-302 is an investigational 2-nitroimidazole prodrug of the DNA alkylator bromo-isophosphoramide (Br-IPM) designed to be selectively activated in hypoxia. TH-302 exhibited anti-tumor activity in preclinical MM models in vitro and in vivo (Hu et al, Blood 2010; Chesi et al, Blood 2012) , and synergism was seen when combined with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Hu et al, Mol Cancer Ther 2013). Based on these findings, a Phase 1/2 study of TH-302 plus dexamethasone was initiated for patients with relapsed/refractory MM. Methods Eligible patients in the study (NCT01522872) had ECOG PS \u2264 2, receipt of at least 2 prior therapies, and acceptable hepatorenal function and hematologic status. A standard 3+3 dose escalation design was used with a fixed oral 40 mg dose of dexamethasone (dex) and 40% dose increments of TH-302. TH-302 was administered IV with dex on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle. The objectives were to determine dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD); assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary clinical activity of TH-302 plus dex; and study the relationship between hypoxia within the bone marrow and response to TH-302. Results As of August 2013, 13 patients have been treated: 8 males/5 females with a median age of 59 years (range: 53 \u2013 86) and 6 prior therapies (range: 3 \u2013 10). All had previously received both bortezomib and lenalidomide/thalidomide containing regimens as well as an alkylating agent. TH-302 was dosed at 240 (n=5), 340 (n=6), and 480 (n=2) mg/m\u00b2 for a median of 5 cycles (range: 1 \u2013 18). No DLTs were reported at 240 or 340 mg/m\u00b2. Two patients treated at 480 mg/m\u00b2 had DLTs of grade 3 mucositis, exceeding the definition of MTD. Four patients had serious adverse events (SAEs) related to TH-302 (pneumonia (n=2), proctalgia (n=1), anemia (n=1)). Three patients continue on study after a median of 17 cycles (range: 7 \u2013 18). Twelve patients have had efficacy evaluations: 2 patients with partial responses (PRs), 3 patients with minimal responses (MRs), and 7 patients with stable disease (SD), for a clinical benefit rate (MR or better) of 42%. Conclusions TH-302 can be administered at 340 mg/m 2 biweekly together with dex, with dose limiting mucositis seen at higher doses. Initial clinical activity has been noted with a clinical benefit rate of 42% in heavily pretreated MM patients who are relapsed/refractory to both bortezomib and lenalidomide.
