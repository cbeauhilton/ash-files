    "abstract_text": "Hemophilia B is considered an appropriate disease target for gene therapy because it is a well characterized monogenic disease with a large therapeutic index. Despite promising preclinical and clinical trials in the last decade, safety and efficacy concerns associated with the in vivo administration of viral vectors still need to be addressed before gene therapy becomes part of the standard arsenal for clinicians. Our laboratory has developed a cell therapy approach using gene-enhanced autologous Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) to deliver a therapeutic plasmatic protein which addresses these safety concerns. In this study, we tested whether MSCs engineered to express human Factor IX (hFIX) can be used to reverse the bleeding phenotype of R333Q hemophilia B mice developed by Stafford et al. We retrovirally engineered MSCs harvested from normal C57Bl/6 to express hFIX. A gene enhanced polyclonal population of MSCs was capable of producing carboxylated and fully active hFIX by in vitro clotting assays. By ELISA, the cells were shown to produce approximately 250ng of hFIX per million cells per 24h. Ten million of these cells were embedded in a collagen I gel matrix and implanted subcutaneously in R333Q hemophilia B mice (n=10). hFIX activity in mouse plasma (test and control groups) were followed weekly by aPTT assays. hFIX activity reached levels as high as 20% normal activity in some animals with an average +/\u2212 SEM of 11.2 +/\u2212 2.1 (FIX activity in controls is <1%). The hFIX activity returned to baseline within 4 weeks. In conclusion, we demonstrate that gene-enhanced autologous MSCs can serve as an effective delivery of functional FIX for temporary correction of the hemophilia B phenotype. We hypothesize the presence of GFP co-expression by the implanted MSCs caused their immune rejection and we are currently testing this hypothesis."
