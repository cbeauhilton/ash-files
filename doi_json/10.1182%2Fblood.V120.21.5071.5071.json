    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5071 The essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a myeloid neoplasm characterized by a inflammatory component responsible for myeloproliferation and hypercoagulability. It has been showed that interleukin-15 (IL-15) affects myelopoiesis and coagulation. Therefore, we evaluated platelets, hematocrit (HCT), as myeloproliferative indicator, tissue factor (TF), as marker of coagulative activation and IL-15. We recruited 25 patients with ET (10 males and 15 females, mean age 58 years) who fulfilled WHO criteria. Their mean duration of disease was 8 years (range, 5\u201321 years). All patients were on aspirin. None of the patients had thrombotic risk factors. Platelets and HCT were measured by automated analyser. IL-15 and TF were measured by ELISA. All patients had thrombocytosis (961\u00b1235\u00d7109/L), high HCT (42\u00b14 vs 37\u00b11 %) (p<. 0001), increased TF (214\u00b1266 pg/ml vs 5\u00b13 pg/ml) (p<. 0001) and elevated IL-15 (21\u00b18 pg/ml vs 2\u00b11 pg/ml) (p<. 0001). A correlation there was between IL-15 and HCT (p=0. 076) and a strong correlation was found between IL-15 and TF (p=0. 046). These results suggest a novel relationship between IL-15 and myeloproliferation and thrombosis that might mean worse prognosis. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
