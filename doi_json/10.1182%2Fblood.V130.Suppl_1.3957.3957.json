    "abstract_text": "Background CXCL12 is a chemokine that is essential for homing of myeloid cells in the bone marrow (BM). It has been postulated that a CXCL12 receptor present in myeloid cells, CXCR4, signals in part through HRAS, a protein that is uniquely dependent on farnesylation for activity. Tipifarnib is a potent and selective inhibitor of the enzyme farnesyltransferase (FT) that had been shown to provide clinical benefit in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS); however, no molecular target that could explain the activity of tipifarnib in AML and MDS has been identified. Based on initial observations in T cell lymphoma (Witzig EHA 2017), we investigated a role for CXCL12 and myeloid cell homing in BM as biomarkers of the activity of tipifarnib in AML and MDS studies. Methods CTEP20 was a phase 2, multicenter, open-label study that investigated the efficacy and safety of tipifarnib in 158 older adults with previously untreated, poor-risk AML. AML301 was a phase 3 (N=457), multicenter, open-label study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of tipifarnib compared with best supportive care (BSC), including hydroxyurea, as first-line therapy in elderly patients with newly diagnosed, de novo, or secondary AML. INT28 was a multicenter phase 2 study that evaluated tipifarnib in 82 pts with poor-risk MDS. Global gene expression data generated using the Affymetrix U133A gene chip from 34 pretreatment BM samples collected from CTEP20 pts (GSE8970) was analyzed with respect to pretreatment hematological parameters and study outcomes. The Kaplan-Meier method was employed to estimate survival and progression free survival (PFS) and the analysis of prognostic variables. Clinical trial information: NCT00027872, NCT00093990, NCT00050154. Results Nine complete responses (CR) and 13 best responses of progression of disease (PD) were observed in 34 pts with available BM gene expression data in study CTEP20. Pts in the 3 rd (upper) tertile of CXCL12 expression experienced 6 CRs and 2 PDs whereas 1 CR and 8 PDs were observed in the 1 st (lower) tertile (p=0.015). BM homing of AML blasts correlated with CXCL12 expression: Median percentage of BM blasts (BMB) and peripheral blasts (PB) were, respectively, 45% and 0% in the upper CXCL12 tertile, and 30% and 26.5% in the lower tertile (p40%) and low circulating blasts (PB40%) and low PB (LLN (no myelosuppression), increasing neutropenia correlated with increasing clinical benefit from tipifarnib that was due in part to a poorer prognosis of BSC in neutropenic pts (113 vs 80 days median OS, HR=0.81, p=0.036, N=109, for pts with baseline neutrophils1 giga/L neutrophils at study entry experienced 5% TI and no responses (N=37) while 30% TI, 2 CRs, 2 CRp and 1 PR were observed in the subset of neutropenic pts. Conclusion CXCL12 expression and BM homing constitute potential biomarkers of the activity of tipifarnib in AML and MDS supporting the hypothesis that the CXCL12 pathway is a potential target of FT inhibitors.
