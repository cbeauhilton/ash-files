    "abstract_text": "The immunotherapy treatments offered for Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) activate various cellular and biochemical mechanisms, including the complement system. Recently it was shown that the classical complement pathway (CP) in CLL patients is persistently activated at a low level through (Michelis et al. PlosOne, 2019), and that the mechanism of chronic CP activation involves the formation of IgG-hexamers (Michelis et al. PlosOne, 2020). According to recent studies, formation of ordered IgG-hexamers occurs on cell surfaces via specific interactions between Fc regions of the IgG monomers, which occur only after antigen binding. The study investigated the formation of IgG-hexamers in CLL patients and normal controls (NC), their ability to activate complement, their incidence as cell-free and cell-bound forms and the identity of the antigen causing their formation. Sera from 30 patients and NC were used for separation of IgG-hexamers. The obtained IgG-hexamers were measure and used for assessment of CP activity. For evaluation of the presence of IgG-hexamers on blood cells, whole blood samples were stained and assessed by flow cytometry. Serum levels of IgG-hexamers were higher in patients compared to NC. Also, they activated the complement system to a higher extent in patients than in NC. Alpha 2 macroglobulin (A2M) was recognized as the antigen causing the hexamerization of IgG, and was found to be part of the hexamer structure by mass spectrometry, Western blot and flow cytometry analysis. The presence of A2M-IgG-hexamers on B-cells suggests that it may be formed on B cells surface and then be detached to become cell-free. Alternatively, it may form in the plasma and then attach to the surface of the cells. The exact course of A2M-IgG-hexamers formation in CLL should be further studied. The results in this study may be useful for improvement of current immunotherapy regimens.
