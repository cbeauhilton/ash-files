    "abstract_text": "Persistence of fetal hemoglobin can ameliorate adult beta (\u03b2)-globin gene disorders. Since SCFAs can affect embryonic and fetal globin gene expression, we examined their role during development. Murine globin gene expression, \u03b2-type (embryonic \u03b2H1, and epsilon-y, \u03b5Y, and adult \u03b2major), and alpha (\u03b1)-type (embryonic zeta, \u03b6, >\u03b1, adult \u03b1), were compared between wildtype (wt) and transgenic mice, in which a key enzyme for SCFA metabolism, PCCA, had been knocked out (PCCA\u2212/\u2212, (Miyazaki et al, 2001). E10.5 PCCA\u2212/\u2212 yolk sac (n= 9), showed increased \u03b1, \u03b2H1 and \u03b6 gene expression, at respectively 2-, 2.6- and 1.6-fold relative to wt (n=13, p<.05), and \u03b5Y gene expression, at 1.7-fold (p=0.07). The embryonic-to-adult globin gene switch was modestly delayed in yolk sacs from E12.5 PCCA\u2212/\u2212 (n=9) vs. wt (n=4) and E 14.5 PCCA\u2212/\u2212 (n=6) vs. wt (n=6). % embryonic \u03b2-type globin gene expression (% \u03b2H1 and \u03b5Y of total \u03b2 globin) was 77\u00b16 PCCA\u2212/\u2212 and 74\u00b13 wt at E12.5, p=n.s., and 42\u00b113 PCCA\u2212/\u2212 and 21\u00b13 wt at E14.5, p<.05; % emvbryonic \u03b1-type expression (% \u03b6 of total \u03b1) was 32\u00b13 PCCA\u2212/\u2212, 25\u00b11wt at E12.5, p<.05 and 7\u00b12 PCCA\u2212/\u2212 and 4\u00b11 wt at E14.5, p<.05). Embryonic globin gene expression in E 12.5 and 14.5 fetal livers was not different between PCCA\u2212/\u2212 and wt embryos. Cultures of pooled E14.5 wt fetal liver cells (FLCs, n=4 separate experiments), however, suggested that embryonic globin genes can be activated in FLCs. The percent of total \u03b2-type globin gene expression that was embryonic after culture with butyrate (1mM) was 11.6\u00b12.6%, with propionate (2.5 mM) was 3.6\u00b10.2%, and insulin/erythropoietin or basal media was 0.03\u00b10.03% and 0.42\u00b10.26% respectively (p<.05 relative to SCFAs). Dose-response with propionate (n=2 seaparate experiments) suggest inadequate endogenous propionate levels for activation in PCCA \u2212/\u2212 fetal liver, as % embryonic \u03b2-type globin gene expression rose above basal levels only at concentrations of 1 to 5 mM (2.5 mM maximal) but not at <0.6 mM. We conclude that endogenous SCFAs, at levels achievable in vivo can activate embryonic globin gene expression during development in the murine yolk-sac. However, higher levels than achievable endogenously currently are necessary to produce this effect in murine fetal livers."
