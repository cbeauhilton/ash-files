    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2638 We recently demonstrated that over 30% of cases with splenic marginal-zone lymphoma (SMZL) express distinctive immunoglobulin (IG) receptors that utilize a single polymorphic variant of the IGHV1-2 gene (IGHV1-2*04) and also exhibit restricted antigen-binding site motifs and precise targeting of somatic hypermutation (SHM). On these grounds, we proposed the existence of molecular subtypes of SMZL defined by immunogenetic analysis of the IG receptors with implications for selection by specific (super) antigenic element(s) in the development of at least a major subset of SMZL. In order to gain insight as to whether antigen involvement is relevant only prior to the malignant transformation or if it continues to affect the SMZL clone itself leading to intraclonal diversification (ID) through ongoing SHM, we conducted a large-scale subcloning study of rearranged IG heavy variable genes, in a total of 471 subcloned sequences from 22 SMZL cases. The analysis was intentionally biased towards cases expressing IGHV1-2*04 receptors that exhibit a series of distinctive immunogenetic features, including biased usage of the IGHD3-3 and IGHD3-10 genes, unusually long heavy complementarity-determining region 3 (VH CDR3) and minimally/borderline mutated status (identity to the germline in the range of 97\u201399.6%). Hence, the study group included 16 IGHV1-2*04 cases and 6 cases utilizing other IGHV genes. PCR reactions were run using the high-fidelity Accuprime Pfx polymerase and a median of 21 (9\u201346) colonies/case were analyzed. All \u201cnon-ubiquitous\u201d sequence changes from the germline were evaluated and recorded as follows: (i) unconfirmed mutation (UCM) - a mutation observed in only one subcloned sequence from the same sample; (ii) confirmed mutation (CM) - a mutation observed in more than one but in less than all subcloned sequences from the same sample. Overall, 15/22 cases (68%) carried intraclonally diversified IGHV-D-J genes with CMs amongst subclones, of which 12 utilized the IGHV1-2*04 gene whereas the remaining 3 utilized other IGHV genes. The high frequency of ID within the IGHV1-2*04 group, ranging from limited to (often) pronounced, is noteworthy in view of the generally low level of SHM among IGHV1-2*04 receptors. Detailed analysis of the distribution and molecular features of CMs revealed: (i) restricted ID patterns, in the sense of identical mutations in certain VH positions among subclones of different cases; (ii) \u201chotspots\u201d of ID, i.e. particular codons exhibiting intense ongoing mutational activity (especially notable in this respect was codon 39 in VH FR2); (iii) a predominance of conservative amino acid changes, characterized by somatically introduced amino acid belonging to the same biochemical category as the mutating amino acid; and (iv) limited diversification within VH CDR3. Additionally, in 7/12 IGHV1-2*04 cases with CMs, identified ID patterns delineate distinct \u201cclusters\u201d of subcloned sequences with unique as well as shared mutations and closely similar if not identical VH CDR3s (including identical VH CDR3 length), pointing to \u201cbranching\u201d of the malignant clone into distinct subclones, perhaps able to evolve along related yet distinct pathways. In conclusion, our study indicates that the SHM mechanism may continuously operate in certain subsets of SMZL, especially those expressing IGHV1-2*04 receptors. Although the precise timing of interactions with antigen(s) and their functional implications for SMZL evolution will likely remain difficult to define accurately, the results reported here suggest a role for persistent antigenic stimulation, at least for certain immunogenetically defined subsets of SMZL.
