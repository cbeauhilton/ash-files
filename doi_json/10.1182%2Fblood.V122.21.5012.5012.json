    "abstract_text": "CD4+ T cells are crucial for the induction and maintenance of cytotoxic T cell responses, but can also mediate direct tumor rejection. The therapeutic efficacy of peptide-based cancer vaccines may thus be improved by including HLA class II epitopes to stimulate T helper cells. In contrast to HLA class I ligands, only a small number of class II ligands of TAA has been described so far. We recently reported on the overexpression of HLA class II in AML cells as compared to autologous monocytes and granulocytes as well as on the first HLA class I leukemia associated antigens identified directly on the cell surface of primary AML cells (Stickel et. al. abstract in Blood 2012). In this study we characterized the HLA class II ligandome in AML to identify additional ligands for a peptide-based immunotherapy approach. HLA class II ligands from primary AML cells as well as bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (BMNCs/PBMCs) of healthy donors were analyzed using the approach of direct isolation and identification of naturally presented HLA peptides by affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). LC-MS/MS peptide analysis provided qualitative and semi-quantitative information regarding the composition of the respective ligandomes. Comparative analysis of malignant and benign samples served to identify ligandome-derived tumor associated antigens (LiTAAs) and to select peptide vaccine candidates. Most abundantly detected peptides were functionally characterized with regard to their ability to induce a specific CD4 + T-cell response in healthy donors and in tumor patients using ELISpot. Samples from 10 AML patients (5 FLT3-ITD mutated) and 18 healthy donors were analyzed. We identified more than 2,100 AML-derived HLA class II ligands representing >1,000 different source proteins, of which 315 were exclusively represented in AML, but not in healthy PBMC/BMNC. Data mining for broadly represented LiTAAs pinpointed 26 HLA class II ligands from 8 source proteins that were presented exclusively on more than 40% of all analyzed AML samples as most promising targets. Amongst them were already described TAAs (e.g., RAB5A) as well as several so far understated proteins (e.g. calsyntenin 1, glycophorin A, mannose-binding lectin 2). Subset analysis revealed 58 LiTAAs presented exclusively on FLT3-ITD mutated AML cells. Additional screening for HLA class II ligands from described leukemia associated antigens showed positive results for NPM1 (1 peptide sequence) and MPO (13 peptide sequences). Peptides from calsyntenin 1 and RAB5A were able to elicit CD4 + -T-cell response in 25% of tested AML patients (n=16). Thus, our study identified, for the first time, HLA class II tumor associated antigens directly obtained from the HLA ligandomes of AML patients and thereby represents a further step to our goal of developing a multipeptide vaccine for immunotherapy of AML.
