    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4606 Fusion cytokines derived from GM-CSF and common \u03b3-chain interleukins have potent gain-of-function properties to alter host immune response. Considering leukemic B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients broadly express the IL-4 receptor, we generated a human GM-CSF and IL-4 derived fusokine GIFT4 to test its immune function on CLL-B cells. Unexpectedly, GIFT4 protein reprograms leukemic B cells into anti-CLL effectors with T-helper features. We show that GIFT4 recombinant protein led to IL4R-dependent hyper-phosphorylation of STAT5 in primary human CLL cells. GIFT4 treated CLL B-cells also up-regulated the expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86. These cells also secreted IL-1b, IL-6, ICAM1 and substantial IL-2. GIFT4-CLL B cells further propelled the expansion of IFN-g-producing CD314 + autologous cytotoxic NK and T cells in vitro . Administration of GIFT4 protein in NSG immune deficient mice decreased the survival of primary CLL cells from patients in murine circulation. Altogether, our data demonstrate that GIFT4 has potent anti-CLL immune function by reprograming leukemic B cells into anti-CLL helper cells. We propose that the newly bio-engineered fusokine GIFT4 could serve as a potential immunotherapeutic for CLL treatment.
