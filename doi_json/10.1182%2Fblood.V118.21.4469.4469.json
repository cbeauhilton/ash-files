    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4469 Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is an important criterion to define risk of relapse in Acute Leukemia (AL). The most powerful methods for MRD characterization are PCR, and flow cytometry (FCM). Although PCR is more sensible that FCM, respectively 10 \u22124 and 10 \u22123 logs, FCM is more applicable than PCR, usually more than 80% versus less than 50% to PCR. In patients eligible for HSTC, the value of MRD is being studied and some results showed implications both in overall survival (OS) as in event free survival (EFS). The RCI seems to be influenced by the presence or absence of MRD, as well. Nowadays the most important factor that influences survival is the relapse. Then, the earlier relapse detection has a potential to improve the therapeutic results. We presented the results of MRD before and after HSTC and its prognostic significance. Other evaluated factors were: age, acute and chronic GVHD (aGVHD and cGVHD), cell source (bone marrow, peripheral blood, cord blood), ATG use, myeloablative conditioning or not, related (RD) and unrelated donor (UD), donor gender and disease status. Bone marrow of 112 AML patients were analyzed by FCM, since January/ 2008 until April / 2011. The evaluation was made in irregular period of time with variable number of samples by patients. They were from 1 to 61 years old. It was considered for analysis the patients that had MRD > 0,1% and < 5%. It was considered as negative result MRD < 0,1%. A dual laser FACSCalibur\u2122 flow cytometer was used to data acquisition and analysis. Four color panels of monoclonal antibodies were chosen according the initial disease phenotype. Cell Quest Software was used for acquisition data and PAINT-A-GATE PRO and Infinicyt \u2122 for FMC analysis. It was done a live gate in reference markers and it was acquired a minimum of 500000 total events in each tube. Statistical analysis were performed by Kaplan Meier curves for OS e EFS and Cox regression. It was observed statistical significance in univariate analysis related to OS the following factors: RD (64%) \u00d7 UR (42%) (p = 0,002), no ATG use (64%) \u00d7 ATG use (44%) \u00d7 (p = 0,003%), no aGVHD (63%) (p = 0,016) \u00d7 aGVHD II to IV (50%), age > 40 years old (yo) (70%), 20 to 40 yo (59%) and < 20 yo (46%) (p = 0,048), MRD after HSCT  0,1% (36%) (p=0,001) (fig 1). The other factors did not show statistical significance with a negative tendency to cord blood use (p = 0,079). To RCI, the significance was observed in: patient age < 21 yo (52%), 21 to 40 yo (30%) and > 40 yo (21%) (p=0,015); and MRD after TCTH > 0,1% (73%) \u00d7 MRD < 0,1% (15%) (p = 0,000). Exerted statistical tendency: MRD < 0,1% before HSCT (p = 0,06), 1 st remission (p = 0,07) and cGVHD (p = 0,08). The group of 44 patients that did not has MRD neither before or after HSCT showed OS of 85% in three years and 11% of RCI. The five morphologic relapses observed in this group suggest that a regular monitorization of MRD must be done. The only factor that kept statistical significance in multivariate analysis was MRD > 0,1% after TCTH in RCI (p = 0,001 HR = 9,93) and for OS (p = 0,001 HR = 3,77) (Tables 1 and 2). In conclusion, the presence of MDR > 0,1% was the only independent prognostic factor for survival and relapse in AML patients after HSCT. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.
