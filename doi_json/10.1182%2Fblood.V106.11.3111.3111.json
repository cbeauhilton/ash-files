    "abstract_text": "B cells have been variously shown to induce direct tolerance of antigen specific CD8 + T cells, induce T cell anergy via TGF-b production, down regulate IL-12 production by dendritic cells (DC) and influence Th1/Th2 differentiation via the production of regulatory cytokines. Through these mechanisms, B cells can exert a regulatory function in in vivo models of T cell immunity including, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recently, B cells have been shown to be essential in the prevention of effector T cell differentiation in a model of autoimmunity. We have previously shown that resting B cells inhibited tumor protection induced by dendritic cells vaccination. Inhibition of DC immunity by B cells was independent of presentation of major histocompatibility molecule (MHC) class-I bound tumor antigen but dependent on the expression of class-II MHC. Furthermore the inhibitory effect of B cells was lost if the B cells were activated by CD40L or if CD4 + /CD25 + regulatory T cells (T reg ) were depleted. These studies have been further extended to examine the role of resting B cells on the induction and severity of graft versus host disease (GVHD) induced in a major MHC mismatch model. We have found that mice transplanted with B cell depleted marrow revealed more rapid CD8 + T cell engraftment, higher IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 production, more severe GVHD and shorter survival. Conversely, those who received additional resting B cells at the time of marrow infusion were substantially protected from GVHD. These findings indicate that resting B cells may regulate T cell activation, in part via the suppressive effects of T reg , but also through their important role in T cell homeostasis. Resting B cells may therefore limit the efficacy of DC based immunotherapy or alternatively be used therapeutically to limit CD8 + T cell autoimmunity including GVHD.",
