    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2507 Aim: microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in many malignancies. Our aim was to identify specific miRNAs that can predict risk of relapse in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients treated according to BFM protocols already at diagnosis. The current risk group stratification is based on the amount of minimal residual disease (MRD) assessed at specific time points by real time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR). Material and methods: Following miRNA expression analysis, we decided to focus on miR-151-5p and miR-451 that significantly correlated with known prognostic factors in ALL. Validation was performed by measuring the expression levels of miR-151-5p and miR-451 by RQ-PCR on bone marrow samples at diagnosis of 101 B-lineage ALL patients excluding Philadelphia positive patients. Results: Low expression of miR-151-5p, miR-451 or of both together resulted in significantly worse relapse free survival (RFS) (43%, 58% and 38%, respectively) compared to RFS rates when either or both miRNAs were highly expressed (81%, 75% and 75%, respectively) (p=0.001, 0.044 and 0.001, respectively). Moreover, following PCR-MRD stratification, low expression of miR-451 or both miRNAs remained significant within the PCR-MRD medium risk group (p=0.00001) and within the standard group for both miRNAs (p=0.024). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified low expression of both miRNAs as an independent prognostic marker with 11.7 fold increased risk for relapse (p=0.002). After excluding patients harboring the adverse genetic markers Ikaros deletion and P2RY8-CRLF2 rearrangement, a patient expressing low levels of both miRs had a 35 fold risk to relapse (p=0.005). Analyzing a non-BFM treated B-lineage ALL cohort from The Netherlands, both miRNAs significantly correlated with outcome (p=0.003). Conclusion: Our results identify miR-151-5p and miR-451 as novel biomarkers for outcome in pediatric B-lineage ALL patients, regardless of treatment protocol. This may allow earlier and improved risk group stratification already at diagnosis, enabling exploration of early therapeutic interventions.
