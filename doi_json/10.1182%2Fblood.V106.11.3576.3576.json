    "abstract_text": "The collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI), plays an essential role in platelet activation and the regulation of hemostasis. Microdomains within the plasma membrane, called lipid rafts, have been implicated in GPVI signaling. The GPVI receptor has been shown to associate with the lipid rafts in both resting and activated platelets. It has been reported that there is a reduction in GPVI signaling in raft-disrupted platelets following activation with various GPVI agonists, especially at low to moderate agonist concentrations. Since platelet aggregation is potentiated by secreted adenosine 5\u2032-diphosphate (ADP) at low concentrations of convulxin and at all concentrations of collagen and collagen-related peptide (CRP), we wanted to determine whether the decrease in GPVI signaling found in platelets with disrupted rafts was due to the loss of agonist potentiation by ADP. We compared platelet aggregation, protein phosphorylation, and calcium mobilization in platelets with intact and disrupted lipid rafts following activation with the GPVI agonists, collagen, convulxin and CRP. We show that lipid raft disruption inhibits aggregation induced by collagen and convulxin, but this inhibition is no longer apparent in the presence of ADP feedback inhibitors. Furthermore, raft-disrupted platelets had the same level of phosphorylation of proteins involved in GPVI signaling (i.e. Syk, LAT, and PLC\u03b32) and the same ability to mobilize calcium following activation with collagen or convulxin. Therefore, the effects of lipid raft disruption on aggregation can be attributed to the loss of ADP feedback. Interestingly, however, raft disruption directly inhibited aggregation and Syk phosphorylation induced by CRP in the presence and absence of ADP feedback. We propose that these differences are due to the fact that CRP is a relatively small, synthesized peptide of 37 amino acids, while collagen and convulxin are large ligands. These agonists are all able to bind the GPVI receptor, but they may not have the same ability to simultaneously cluster multiple receptors due to their size differential. The lipid rafts may be important for CRP stimulation, but not for collagen or convulxin, because they may have a higher density of the GPVI receptor than nonraft membrane regions, allowing CRP to cluster multiple receptors and activate the GPVI signaling cascade. When we disrupt the lipid rafts, we are reducing the effective concentration of GPVI available for activation by CRP but not by collagen or convulxin.",
