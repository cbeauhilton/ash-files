    "abstract_text": "Long-term hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into all mature hematopoietic lineages. This process is regulated by transcription factors interact with co-factors to orchestrate chromatin structure and facilitate gene expression. To generate a compendium of factors that establish the epigenetic code in HSCs, we have undertaken the first large-scale in vivo reverse genetic screen targeting chromatin factors. We have designed and injected antisense morpholinos to knockdown expression of 488 zebrafish orthologs of conserved human chromatin factors. The resultant morphants were analyzed by whole embryo in situ hybridization at 36 hours post fertilization for expression of two HSC marker genes, c-myb and runx1, which are expressed in the developing blood stem cells. Morphants were categorized into five groups based on HSC marker expression, ranging from no change to mild, intermediate, or strong reduction in expression or an increase in expression. 29 morpholinos caused a complete or near complete knockdown of HSC marker expression, while 4 were found to increase HSC marker expression. As ubiquitous knockdown of chromatin factors could interfere with vascular development and the establishment of proper arterial identity, a crucial upstream event for HSC formation, we subsequently analyzed morphants with the most robust HSC phenotypes using two vascular markers: kdr for overall vasculogenesis and ephrinb2a for arterial formation. We found that of the 29 morpholinos that caused reduced marker expression, only 9 showed reduced overall vascular or arterial marker staining, suggesting that the majority of morphants with HSC phenotypes are specific to HSC formation. For the 4 morphants with increased HSC marker expression, vasculature appeared normal. These factors likely function as potent negative regulators of HSC development. Several genes known to be essential for HSC self-renewal and maintenance were identified in the screen. For example, knockdown of Mll or Dot1, which are also present in leukemia fusion proteins, fail to specify HSCs, as indicated by a nearly complete reduction in expression of the HSC markers in embryos tested. Of the remaining hits, many represent factors with no previous function ascribed in hematopoiesis. By incorporating protein interaction data, we have defined a handful of complexes necessary for HSC specification, including the SWI/SNF, ISWI, SET1/MLL, CBP/P300/HBO1/NuA4, HDAC/NuRD, and Polycomb complexes. As chromatin factors associated with the same complex likely share target binding sites, we analyzed 34 published ChIP-seq datasets in K562 erythroleukemia cells of chromatin factors tested in the screen, including hits from our screen: SIN3A, CHD4, HDAC1, TAF1, and JARID1C associated with the HDAC/NuRD complex and RNF2, SUZ12, CBX2, and CBX8 from the Polycomb complexes. We ranked triplet combinations of these factors together with all other groups of three factors based on the percent overlap of target genes. The HDAC/NuRD and PRC1/2 complex combinations predicted from our screen fell within the top 20% of all possible combinations of 3 factors, suggesting that our screen has identified chromatin factors that function in distinct complexes to regulate hematopoietic development. Our work has been compiled into a web-based database that will be made publicly available upon publication. Within this database, users can search by gene names and aliases, chromatin domain names and human or zebrafish genes. All experimental data, including experimental design, materials, protocols, images, and all further analyses of the 33 most robust morphants is included. Our large-scale genetic analysis of chromatin factors involved in HSC development provides a comprehensive view of the programs involved in epigenetic regulation of the blood program, offering new avenues to pursue in the study of histone modifications in HSCs and for therapeutic alternatives for patients with blood disorders and leukemia.
