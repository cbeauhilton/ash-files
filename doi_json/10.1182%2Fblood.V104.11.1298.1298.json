    "abstract_text": "The abrogation of an intact TGF\u00df/TGF\u00df receptor signal transduction pathway in SMAD3\u2212/\u2212 mice is associated with a decreased inflammatory response, and decreased acute and late response to ionizing irradiation damage. We tested the role of SMAD3 in bone marrow cellular capacity for hematopoiesis and in marrow stromal cellular potential for adipocytogenesis. Long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMCs) were established from SMAD3\u2212/\u2212, +/\u2212, and +/+ mice. Permanent clonal bone marrow stromal cell (MSC) lines were established from each mouse strain. The SMAD3+/+ and SMAD3+/\u2212 LTBMCs generated hematopoietic progenitor cells (by CFU-GEMM assay), and maintained active cobblestone island numbers and production of non-adherent cells for 22\u201323 weeks. In striking contrast, the SMAD3\u2212/\u2212 LTBMCs demonstrated a significant increase in longevity of hematopoiesis as measured by each assay for over 34 weeks and non-adherent cells continued to form GEMM beyond 34 weeks. The number of CFU-GEMM per 5x10 4 cells (d 14) in SMAD3\u2212/\u2212 cultures (188 \u00b1 8.7) was 1250% greater (p<0.0001) than in SMAD3+/+ cultures (15.3 \u00b1 2.3). Microscopic inspection at 27 weeks showed that more (16.5%, p<0.001) SMAD3\u2212/\u2212 adherent cells contained lipid droplets (6.6% \u00b1 0.7) compared with SMAD3+/+ adherent cells (0.4% \u00b1 0.2). Because of that difference, we examined the regulation of adipocyte differentiation in MSC lines from those mice. First, there was more extensive (37-fold) adipocyte differentiation in SMAD3\u2212/ \u2212 than SMAD3+/+ cultures. Second, there was a 7-fold attenuation of TGF-\u00df inhibition of adipocytogenesis in cells lacking SMAD3. RT-PCR evaluation showed greater expression of the adipocyte gene, ADIPSIN, and absence of its downregulation by TGF\u00df in SMAD3\u2212/\u2212 compared to SMAD3+/+. The data suggest that SMAD3 is a critical inhibitor of adipocyte differentiation. The data document pleiotrophic effects of interruption of the TGF\u00df/TGF\u00df receptor signal transduction cascade for both inhibition of hematopoietic support capacity and adipocyte differentiation of the bone marrow microenvironment.",
