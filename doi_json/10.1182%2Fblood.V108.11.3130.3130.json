    "abstract_text": "Background. Conventional matching of patients and their unrelated donor (UD) hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) by 4-digit molecular HLA typing is associated with lengthy donor searches and elevated social costs. 80% of UD transplants are performed across DPB1 mismatches which, if involving disparity in host versus graft (HvG) direction for an immunogenic T cell epitope, have been shown to be associated with poor clinical outcome of transplantation for hematopoietic malignancies and beta-thalassemia. In this study we have developed an innovative approach of DPB1 epitope- rather than allele-specific matching, by only two PCR reactions (epitope-specific typing; EST). Moreover, we have determined allelic DPB1 frequencies in Italy, confronted them with the ones previously reported for other ethnic groups, and calculated the probability of finding non-permissive DPB1 mismatches in unrelated HSC donor searches. Methods. High resolution genomic DPB1 typing and EST were performed in parallel on blood samples taken from 112 healthy unrelated Italian blood donors. Results. EST of DPB1 alleles encoding the immunogenic T cell epitope yielded 100% concordant results with high resolution DPB1 typing in all 112 samples studied, and is therefore suitable to univocally determine the presence or absence of non-permissive DPB1 disparities. The overall frequency of DPB1 alleles encoding the shared T cell epitope in the Italian population was 23.15%. Importantly, we show that based on DPB1 allelic polymorphism in the four ethnic groups representative of the world-wide UD registries, over 75% of UD matched for the other HLA loci will not present a DPB1 epitope disparity in HvG direction, demonstrating that prospective UD-recipient DPB1 matching by EST does not significantly limit the number of suitable donors, and has a negligible impact on the time and cost of the search. Conclusions. EST is a challenging alternative to conventional tissue typing which, if applied more broadly to HLA loci other than DPB1, could fundamentally change current approaches to UD searches."
