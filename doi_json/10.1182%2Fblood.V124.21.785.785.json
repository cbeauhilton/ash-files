    "abstract_text": "The serine/ threonine kinase, p38 MAPK is activated by phosphorylation in response to a variety of cellular stresses including oxidative stress. Prolonged p38 MAPK activation drives cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis; and in HSC activation of p38 MAPK leads to a loss of reconstituting capacity (Ito et al , Nat.Med. 2006;12:446-451). In cancer, p38 MAPK responses are often attenuated and cancer models suggest that this is a necessary adaptation for transformation (Dolado et al , Cancer Cell 2007;11:191-205). Previously we have shown that 60% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients constitutively generate significantly more extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) than normal hematopoietic CD34 + cells (Hole et al, Blood 2013;122:3322-3330). Despite this, AML blasts showed low or absent p38 MAPK phosphorylation; even in patients generating high levels of ROS. Here we examine p38 MAPK activation at the single cell level in primary AML blasts using flow cytometry. We challenged AML blasts with a dose of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) sufficient to completely activate p38 MAPK in normal CD34 + cells (1 mM for 30 min), where the threshold for activation was defined as the 95 th percentile of basal p38 MAPK activation in unstimulated cells. Attenuated responses to H 2 O 2 were seen in 14/15 (93%) of patients; where 16-95% of the total blast population failed to activate p38 MAPK . These non-responding cells are hereafter termed \u201c\u0394pp38 MAPK cells\u201d and were absent in normal CD34 + cells (p < 0.01; Figure 1 ). Examination of a panel of 6 AML cell lines showed that each of the lines contained \u0394pp38 MAPK cells at different frequencies: MV4-11 (10%); HL60 (10%); KG-1 (15%), U937 (30%), NB4 (50%), THP-1 (65%). Further analysis showed that \u0394pp38 MAPK cells were not distinguished by cell cycle phase, immunophenotype or reduced viability in either cell lines or AML blasts. These data suggest that nearly all AML patients harbor a population of blasts which have developed resistance to p38 MAPK activation. We reasoned that failure to respond could arise either through defective p38 MAPK signaling or because of enhanced anti-oxidative protection in a subpopulation of cells. To investigate the latter, we labelled cells with the lipophilic oxidation probe, C 11 -BODIPY or the cytosolic oxidant probe, CM-DCFDA and monitored the oxidative response to H 2 O 2 at the single cell level in the AML cell lines: KG-1, MV4-11 and THP-1. In each case C 11 -BODIPY oxidation exactly matched the heterogeneous profile of p38 MAPK activation in these cells, whereas CM-DCFDA showed only homogeneous responses to H 2 O 2 induction. These data show that \u0394pp38 MAPK cells are defined by an enhanced membrane-associated anti-oxidant capacity and we are currently analyzing this resistant subpopulation to identify the molecules responsible. To examine whether p38 MAPK responsiveness influenced responsiveness to pro-oxidant drugs, we selected KG-1 and THP-1 cells (as representative examples of strong and weak p38 MAPK responses respectively) and tested their sensitivity to the pro-oxidant drugs, phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). We found that the IC 50 was higher for THP-1 for both PEITC (KG-1 = 0.6\u00b5M; THP-1 = 7.5\u00b5M) and BSO (KG-1 = 50\u00b5M; THP-1 = 70\u00b5M), indicating that the p38 MAPK responsiveness limits the effectiveness of pro-oxidant drugs. We next examined whether promoting p38 MAPK activation could augment the effects of these pro-oxidants. We used the p38 MAPK activator 2-benzylidene-3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-indanone (BCI), which promotes activation of p38 MAPK via inhibition of a p38 MAPK phosphatase, DUSP1. This compound weakly promoted phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in THP-1 cells and consistent with this, had no effect on the efficacy of these compounds in these cells. However, BCI potently activated p38 MAPK in KG-1 cells and showed synergy with BSO in this context (CI = 0.3; Figure 2 ) indicating that where BCI is effective in activating p38 MAPK it can promote the effectiveness of pro-oxidant drugs. In summary, we show for the first time that AML patients almost universally display attenuated p38 MAPK responses in all or part of the blast population and we suggest that this trait may be selected for to maintain self-renewing potential under the pro-oxidative conditions found in the leukemic marrow. Further we show that by manipulating p38 MAPK activity, we can augment the potency of the pro-oxidant compound BSO.
