    "abstract_text": "Unlike Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2, Jak3 is the only member of the Jak family of secondary messengers that signals exclusively by binding the common gamma chain of interleukin receptors IL2, IL4, IL7, IL9, IL15, and IL21. Jak3-null mice display defective T and NK cell development, which results in a mild SCID phenotype. Still, functional Jak3 expression outside the hematopoietic system remains unreported. Our data show that Jak3 is expressed in endothelial cells across hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic organs, with heightened expression in the bone marrow and spleen. Increased arterial zonation in the bone marrow of Jak3-null mice further suggests that Jak3 is a marker of sinusoidal endothelium, which is confirmed by fluorescent microscopy staining and single-cell RNA-sequencing. We also show that the Jak3-null niche is deleterious for the maintenance of long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (LT-HSCs) and that Jak3-overexpressing endothelial cells have increased potential to expand LT-HSCs in vitro. In addition, we identify the soluble factors downstream of Jak3 that provide endothelial cells with this functional advantage and show their localization to the bone marrow sinusoids in vivo. Our work serves to identify a novel function for a non-promiscuous tyrosine kinase in the bone marrow vascular niche and further characterize the hematopoietic stem cell niche of sinusoidal endothelium.
