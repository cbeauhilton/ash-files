    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Antitumor activity of the neddylation inhibitor pevonedistat has been documented in several hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies. Unexpectedly, Zhou et al (PNAS, 2016) discovered a dose-dependent biphasic effect of pevonedistat in solid tumor cell lines. While micromolar concentrations inhibited tumor cell growth, low nanomolar concentrations significantly increased cell proliferation and tumor stem cell self-renewal both in vitro and in vivo . The effect of low-dose pevonedistat has not yet been explored in the field of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Therefore, we evaluated how pevonedistat affects the viabiilty, growth and proportions of CD34 + cell subpopulations. In view of the emerging role of neddylation in the regulation of both innate and adaptive immunity, we also investigated the influence of pevonedistat on T-cell activation to explore a potentially beneficial effect on posttransplant immune complications. Methods and Results : Using the WST-1 assay we confirmed the biphasic effect of pevonedistat on normal mobilized CD34 + cells. Incubation for 72 h with 0.1 \u00b5M pevonedistat significantly increased metabolic activity as a surrogate parameter for proliferation, while 1.0 \u00b5M pevonedistat showed a cytotoxic effect. We explored the underlying mechanism for the low-dose effect. Since Zhou et al. previously showed that pevonedistat can promote tumor stem cell proliferation by inducing EGFR homodimerization, we used a proximity ligation assay and found that 0.1 \u00b5M pevonedistat induced EGFR homodimerization in normal mobilized CD34 + cells, too. In addition to homodimerization, we also looked at phosphorylation at Tyr1068, a marker of EGFR activation. By flow cytometry, we showed that phosphorylation was increased by 0.01 \u00b5M and 0.1 \u00b5M pevonedistat. Using an ELISA-based transcription assay, we also observed a biphasic effect of pevonedistat on c-Myc expression, which is regarded as a marker of 'stemness'. Incubation with pevonedistat for 72 hrs at 0.01 and 0.1 \u00b5M stimulated expression of c-Myc, whereas incubation at 1.0 \u00b5M downregulated c-Myc. Fractions of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) subpopulations were measured in CD34 + cells from cord blood after incubation with 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 \u00b5M pevonedistat. Flow cytometry was performed using antibodies against CD34, CD45RA and CD133, as well as 7-AAD for testing cell viability. Exposure to pevonedistat for 72 hrs at 0.1 \u00b5M caused an increase in the number of CD34 + cells compared to vehicle-treated CD34+ cells at 72 h as well as compared to initial number of CD34+ cells, whereas 1.0 \u00b5M caused a significant decrease. The absolute number of multipotent progenitors (MPP) (CD34 + CD133 + CD45RA - ) remained relatively stable at all concentrations, while lympho-myeloid progenitors (LMPP) (CD34+CD133+CD45RA+) and late progenitors (LP) (CD34+CD133-CD45RA+) increased slightly with 0.1 \u00b5M pevonedistat compared with controls. However, a significant decrease in LMPP and LP cell numbers was observed at 1.0 \u00b5M. Different concentrations of pevonedistat were tested for their capability to modulate allogeneically stimulated T cell activation in a multi-donor mixed lymphocyte reaction (mdMLR) assay in vitro . Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EV) were used as internal immuno-modulatory and non-immuno-modulatory controls in the assay. After 5 days, alterations in the immune cell composition were analyzed by flow cytometry. Pevonedistat was not toxic for MNCs in the mdMLR. However, it decreased the number of activated (CD25high CD54+) CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells. Conclusions: One of the problems in the post-transplant period is a rapid decline in MPP numbers, associated with increased risk of engraftment failure. We showed that low-dose pevonedistat (0.1 \u00b5M) is capable of increasing the number of CD34 + cells in vitro while keeping the absolute number of MPPs stable. This finding, together with the observed increase in c-Myc expression, suggests that pevonedistat may help to preserve 'stemness' of CD34+ donor cells, thus supporting engraftment of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Furthermore, the immunosuppressive effects revealed by mdMLR suggest that low-dose pevonedistat may also play a useful immunomodulatory role in the post-transplant setting to potentially reduce the risk of graft-versus-host disease.
