    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3717 The incorporation of combined-modality therapy, risk-stratified chemotherapy selection, high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell support (HDC-ASCS), and monitoring treatment response by functional imaging are factors that have contributed to the improvement in clinical outcomes in HL patients. Unfortunately, those patients not eligible for or that have failed HDC-ASCS remain a challenge for the treating oncologist, stressing the need for novel therapeutic strategies. Significant improvements in the understanding of the biology of HL have been achieved, including cellular pathways altered in HL (e.g. the ubiquitin-proteasome system) and the role of the tumor microenvironment. MLN4924 is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE). NAE is an enzyme responsible for activating NEDD8, an ubiquitin-like molecule in the neddylation cascade that is responsible for cullin-ring ligase (CRL) mediated polyubiquitination of proteins targeting them for proteasomal degradation. In order to better understand the activity of MLN4924 in HL, we performed pre-clinical testing in IkB wild type (L-1236), IkB mutated (KM-H2 and L-428) HL cell lines, and in primary tumor cells derived from a HL patient. Malignant cells were exposed to escalating doses of MLN4924 and changes in cell viability were quantified at different time periods by alamar Blue reduction assay. Patient tumor cells were incubated with MLN4924 for 48 hrs and cell viability was determined using the CellTiterGlo assay. Induction of apoptosis in HL cell lines following exposure to MLN4924 was determined by flow cytometry for Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) staining and western blot for caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry using PI staining. Inhibition of NAE by MLN4924 in HL cell lines was measured by western blot for NEDD8-cullin. Finally, changes in NF-kB activity following MLN4924 exposure were determined by p65 nuclear localization using Image stream technology. MLN4924 exhibited a dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability in all HL cell lines at nM concentrations. No differences in anti-tumor activity were observed between IkB-wild type (L-1236 IC 50 = 250nM) and IkB\u2013mutated HL cell lines (KM-H2 IC 50 = 250nM and L-428 IC 50 = 300nM). MLN4924 induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in all cell lines tested. In addition, MLN4924 induced cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and inhibition of NAE was demonstrated by a decrease in NEDD8 conjugated CRL. L1236 cells exposed to MLN4924 also demonstrated a decrease in degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 as evidenced by increased levels of p-I\u03baB\u03b1 following exposure to MLN4924 with a corresponding decrease in p65 nuclear translocation. Surprisingly KMH-2 cells, which carry a mutated I\u03baB\u03b1 protein that is truncated and non-functional, had a decrease in nuclear p65 following exposure to MLN4924, suggesting an alternative mechanism of NF-kB inhibitory activity by MLN4924. In summary, MLN4924 demonstrates activity against HL cells in vitro through inhibition of NF-kB, and is a promising novel agent for the treatment of HL. We continue to investigate the pre-clinical activity of MLN4924 both as a single-agent and in combination with traditional chemotherapy and other novel agents.
