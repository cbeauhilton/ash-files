    "abstract_text": "The prevalence of congenital platelet disorders has not been established but for some life-threatening bleeding disorders the current therapies are not adequate, justifying the development of alternative strategies as gene therapy. In the case of platelet dysfunction and thrombocytopenia as described for GATA1 deficiency, potentially lethal internal bleedings can occur. The objective of the study is to develop improved lentiviral vectors for megakaryocyte(MK)-specific long term gene expression by ex vivo transduction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to ultimately use for congenital thrombopathies as GATA1 deficiency. Self-inactivating lentiviral vectors were constructed expressing GFP driven by the murine (m) or human (h) GPIIb promoter. These promoters contain multiple Ets and GATA binding sites directing MK-specificity. To evaluate the cell lineage-specificity and transgene expression potential of the vectors, murine Sca1+ and human CD34+ HSC were transduced in vitro with Lenti-hGPIIb-GFP and Lenti-mGPIIb-GFP vectors. After transduction the HSC were induced to differentiate in vitro along the MK and non-MK lineages. The mGPIIb and hGPIIb promoters drove GFP expression at overall higher levels (20% in murine cells and 25% in human cells) than the ubiquitous CMV (cytomegalovirus) or PGK (phosphoglycerate kinase) promoters, and this exclusively in the MK lineage. Interestingly, in both human and murine HSC the hGPIIb promoter with an extra RUNX and GATA binding site, was more potent in the MK lineage compared to the mGPIIb promoter. Since FLI1 and GATA1 are the main transcription factors regulating GPIIb expression, we tested the Lenti-hGPIIb-GFP construct in GATA1 deficient HSC and obtained comparable transduction efficiencies as for wild-type HSC. To assess the MK-specificity of the lentiviral vectors in vivo , we transplanted irradiated wild-type C57Bl/6 mice with Sca1+ HSC transduced with the Lenti-hGPIIb-GFP constructs. Six months after transplantation we could detect 6% GFP positive platelets without a GFP signal in other cell lineages. Conclusion: In vitro and in vivo MK-specific transgene expression driven by the hGPIIb and mGPIIb promoters could be obtained after ex vivo genetic engineering of HSC by improved lentiviral vectors. Studies are ongoing to study whether this approach can induce phenotypic correction of GATA1 deficient mice by transplantation of ex vivo Lenti-hGPIIb-GATA1 transduced HSC.",
