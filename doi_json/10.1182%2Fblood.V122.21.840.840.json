    "abstract_text": "Despite the substantial improvements made in the outcomes of paediatric ALL, with \u2018cure' rates now in excess of 90%, survival in teenage and young adult (TYA) patients has remained inferior. The reasons for this are likely multifactorial, including tumour biology, toxicity, compliance, access to clinical trials and protocol (adult or paediatric) used. We report the toxicity profiles observed in children, teenagers and young adults treated on the UK intensive, minimal residual disease (MRD) directed ALL protocol, UKALL2003. Of a total of 3126 patients treated, 1520 patients were under 5 years old, 767 were aged 5-9 years, 610 aged 10-15 years and 229 aged 16-24 years, with a median overall follow-up of 4 year and 10 months. The risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) was higher in patients older than 10 years (56% in 10-15 year olds, 53% in 16-24 year olds) compared to those aged 9 or younger (30% in under 5 years and 31% in 5-9 years)(p<0.0001), with no difference in the those aged 16-24 compared to younger teenagers (p=0.5). The incidence (per number of patients in each group) and distribution of toxicities according to age group is summarised in the table . Table 1  Age in years . <5 . 5-9 . 10-15 . 16-24 . All .

Avacular necrosis was seen predominantly in adolescents (83% of 147 events in 10-19 year olds) and was rare in those younger than 10 years (n=18) or older than 20 years (n=7). Asparaginase thrombotic events increased in frequency with increasing age (1.5% in under 5 years, 3.3% in 5-9 years, 4.4% in 10-15 years and 8.3% in 16-24 year olds)(p<0.0001). All other toxicities were more frequently observed in over 10 year olds compared to patients aged 9 or younger, with no difference between 16-24 year olds and 10-15 year olds. The impact of age on SAEs associated with intensive ALL chemotherapy varies according to specific toxicities. In general, toxicity is higher in those over 10 years compared to younger patients, with no excess toxicity in those aged 16-24 compared to 10-15 years. However, specific toxicities may increase with increasing age (thrombosis), be restricted to adolescence (AVN) or be unrelated to age (vincristine neurotoxicity, asparaginase hypersensitivity).
