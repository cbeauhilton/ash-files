    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1897 Poster Board I-920 Background: Chuvash polycythemia is caused by homozygosity for the VHL598C>T mutation, which leads to up-regulation of HIF-1a and HIF-2a in normoxia. As the result, circulating concentrations of erythropoietin are elevated. Chuvash polycythemia patients suffer from cardiovascular abnormalities that include pulmonary arterial hypertension, thrombosis and stroke. Phlebotomy is a common therapy for patients to decrease symptoms such as plethora and headache. However, the outcomes of phlebotomy have not been assessed for these patients. The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the effect of phlebotomy on hemoglobin concentration, serum concentrations of ferritin and erythropoietin, and echocardiographically-determined tricuspid regurgitation velocity, which reflects systolic pulmonary artery pressure. Methods: One hundred twenty patients homozygous for VHL598C>T and 38 controls of comparable age and gender from Chuvash Republic of the Russian Federation were studied. Clinical and demographic characteristics were determined and echocardiography was performed. Serum ferritin and erythropoietin concentrations were measured by ELISA. Results: The median (interquartile) age for Chuvash polycythemia cases was 36 (22\u201348) years. They included 68 females (56%). Chuvash polycythemia patients had higher serum erythropoietin concentration (medians of 46 versus 8 mIU/ml, P = 0.0001) and lower serum ferritin concentration (medians of 12 versus 48 ng/ml, P = 0.0001) compared to controls. Tricuspid regurgitation velocity was higher in cases than controls (medians of 2.5 vs. 2.3 m/sec, P = 0.007). Among the cases, 87 (71%) had a history of phlebotomy and 54 of these had phlebotomy within the last year. Phlebotomy was associated with higher erythropoietin concentration (P = 0.033) and lower ferritin concentration (P = 0.024) but no significant difference in hemoglobin concentration (P = 0.9) ( Table 1 ). After adjusting for the effect of age, phlebotomy was associated with significantly higher odds of tricuspid regurgitation velocity \u22652.5 (m/sec) (odds ratio: 3.3; 95% CI: 1.1\u20139.9). Table 1.

In this process, estimated pulmonary systolic blood pressure appears to increase. Therefore, phlebotomy therapy might be a risk factor for pulmonary hypertension in the context of Chuvash polycythemia. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
