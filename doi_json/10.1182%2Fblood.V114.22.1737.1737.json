    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1737 Poster Board I-763 We previously reported the efficacy and B-cell selectivity of the natural product silvestrol in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), using both primary cells and B-cell lines. We also showed that silvestrol inhibits translation, resulting in rapid depletion of the short half-life protein Mcl-1 followed by mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. Cencic et al. reported that silvestrol directly blocks translation initiation by aberrantly promoting interaction of eIF4A with capped mRNA (PLoS One 2009; 4(4):e5223). However, the loss of Mcl-1 in breast and prostate cancer cell lines is delayed relative to what we observe in B-leukemias (48 hr vs. 4-6 hr in CLL and ALL cells). Additionally, silvestrol does not reduce Mcl-1 expression in normal T-cells to the same extent that it does in B-cells, potentially explaining in part the relative resistance of T-cells to this agent. We therefore investigated cell-type differences, as well as the importance of Mcl-1, in silvestrol-mediated cytotoxicity. We incubated the ALL cell line 697 with gradually increasing concentrations of silvestrol to generate a cell line (697-R) with resistance to 30 nM silvestrol (IC50 of parental 697 < 5 nM). No differences between 697-R and the parental line were detected upon detailed immunophenotyping. However, cytogenetic analysis revealed a balanced 7q;9p translocation in 697-R not present in the parental 697 cell line that may be related to the emergence of a resistant clone. We also detected no difference in expression of multi-drug resistance proteins MDR-1 and MRP, which can contribute to resistance to complex amphipathic molecules such as silvestrol. In contrast, we found that baseline Mcl-1 protein expression is strikingly increased in 697-R cells relative to the parental line, although these cells still show similar percent-wise reduction in Mcl-1 upon re-exposure to 80 nM silvestrol. To investigate whether this resistance to silvestrol is reversible, 697-R cells were maintained without silvestrol for 6 weeks (\u223c18 passages). During this time, viability remained near 99%. Cells were then treated with 30 nM silvestrol. Viability was 94% at 48 hr post-treatment and returned to 99% within a week, while parental 697 cells with the same treatment were completely dead. Baseline Mcl-1 levels remained elevated in 697-R even with prolonged silvestrol-free incubation. These results indicate that the resistance phenotype is not rapidly reversible, as is seen with transient upregulation of multi-drug resistance or stress-response proteins. Additionally, silvestrol moderately induces the transcription of several pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and results in elevated levels of these proteins despite its translation inhibitory activity. Interestingly, no such activity is detected in silvestrol-treated normal T-cells. Together, these results support the hypothesis that in B-cells, silvestrol induces cell death by altering the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, and that increased Mcl-1 protein can force the balance back toward survival. This work further underscores the importance of Mcl-1 in silvestrol-mediated cytotoxicity. We are now investigating the mechanism of Mcl-1 upregulation in 697-R cells to identify a factor or pathway that can be targeted therapeutically to circumvent resistance. Silvestrol is currently undergoing preclinical pharmacology and toxicology investigation by the U.S. National Cancer Institute Drug Development Group at the Stage IIA level to facilitate its progression to Phase I clinical testing.
