    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: B-Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is still uncurable but very powerful new tools are available with the use of chemoimmunotherapy (CIT). Purine nucleoside-based regimens that incorporate rituximab have generated very high levels of overall responses (OR) with significant percentage of those complete responses (CR) in previously untreated CLL. Here we report and update our experience with a phase 2 pentostatin-based CIT regimen for previously untreated CLL as conducted at 2 medical centers. We also studied the association of outcome based on risk stratification parameters and achievement of minimal residual disease. METHODS: Building on prior work of pentostatin in CLL by us (Kay ASH, 2004) and others, we initiated a trial of combined pentostatin (P)(2 mg/m 2 ), cyclophosphamide (C)(600 mg/m 2 ) and rituximab (R)(375 mg/m 2 ) for symptomatic, previously untreated patients (n=65). This PCR regimen is given on a 21-day, 6-cycle schedule. However, the initial cycle of treatment uses thrice weekly rituximab as described by us earlier. In brief, this was rituximab at 100 mg/m 2 on day 1, 375 mg/m 2 on days 3 and 5 of the first week only. Prophylactic Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim and Acyclovir were given to all patients for 1 year starting on the first cycle of therapy with PCR. All patients were risk stratified using CD38, ZAP-70, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene (IgV H ) and FISH panel assessments at entry. RESULTS: These patients were characterized as mostly in high-risk categories. Of 64 evaluable patients, 34 (53%) were high Rai risk (stage 3\u20134), 71% were non mutated for the IgV H gene, 34% were CD38+ and 34% were ZAP-70+. Thirty patients (52%) had one FISH anomaly, and 21 (36%) had complex FISH defects. Thirty-eight patients (58%) had grade 3 + hematologic toxicity but minimal transfusion needs, and no major infections. NCI Working Group Criteria Responses occurred in 58 (91%) with 26 (41%) complete responses (CR), 14 (22%) nodular partial responses (nodular PR), and 18 (28%) partial responses (PR) patients. Outcome for all 64 patients demonstrates a median progression-free survival of 32.6 months. Importantly, no high risk factor (i.e., age, FISH, IgV H status, CD38+, ZAP-70+) except for del (17p) defect (n=3) precluded attaining a CR or NPR. In contrast, we found this regimen was equally effective in young vs. elderly (>70 yrs) patients and in del(11)(q22.3) vs. other favorable prognostic FISH factors. Examination of outcome among CR and nodular PR patients for PFS by flow cytometry status (negative vs. positive, i.e., \u2264 1 % CD5 + /CD19 + vs. \u2265 1 % CD5 + /CD19 + ) demonstrated improvement in progression free survival for patients who attained flow cytometry negativity (p = 0.009). Conclusion: This novel regimen of pentostatin, cyclophosphamide and rituximab for previously untreated CLL demonstrated significant clinical activity despite poor risk-based prognoses with minimal toxicity in terms of bone marrow suppression and/or infections. The additional feature of this approach is the ability to have durable responses for all age groups and even CLL patients with a del(11)(q22.3).",
