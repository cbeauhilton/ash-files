    "abstract_text": "Background: Adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia / lymphoma (T-ALL) is a rare and aggressive hematological malignancy. Unlike B-cell ALL, apart from age and presenting WBC, additional prognostic factors remain largely unknown. Additionally, the prognostic impact of a monosomal karyotype, which has a negative impact on survival in myeloid neoplasms, remains to be determined in T-ALL (Kenderian et al, BCJ 2013) Aim: To study predictors of survival including the role of a monosomal karyotype in T-ALL. Methods: After due IRB approval, adults diagnosed with T-ALL from 1990-2014 at Mayo Clinic Rochester were identified. All clinical and pathologic data including FISH studies and cytogenetics were retrospectively reviewed. Chi-square test was used to compare variables. Survival was estimated and compared using the Kaplan-Meier Method and log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox regression model. Results: Between 1990 and 2014, a total of 92 consecutive patients (pts) with T-ALL were identified, 41 had acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL), and 51 (55%) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Median age at diagnosis was 33 years (range; 18-88 years) with 72%males. Median follow up of our cohort was 25 months (range; 0.9-260 months) during which time 42 deaths (45%) were documented. A. Baseline characteristics: Fifty six (67%) had constitutional symptoms, and 63 (77%) had lymphadenopathy at diagnosis. Mediastinal mass was identified in 49 (55%) pts with palpable splenomegaly in 16 (20%) pts. Fifty one (58%) pts had extranodal disease, and 17 (19%) pts had CNS involvement. Pleural and pericardial effusion were evident in 16 (19%), and 6 (7%) pts, respectively. Median laboratory values included; LDH 288 U/L (115-6590), hemoglobin (Hb) 12.8 g/dl (4.5-18.2), WBC 8.65 x10 9 (1.4-406), platelets 169 x10 9 (8-485), bone marrow blasts 29% (0-99). B. Treatments: Induction therapies were variable and included; 11 (12%) CHOP like regimens, 7 (8%) modified NHL regimens (Asparginase+CHOP), 54 (58%) ALL like regimens (CALGB 9111, E2993, or HyperCVAD), 13 (14%) Pediatric regimens (ALL 10403, CCG 1961, BFM, Augmented BFM, GRAALL 2003, or Hoelzer regimen), with 7 (8%) patients' receiving palliative care only. Seventy-one (77%) pts achieved complete remission (CR1) during induction therapy while eight pts had refractory disease (8%). Thirty-three (35%) pts underwent stem cell transplant; 7 (21%) autologous and 26 (79%) allogeneic. Forty one (44%) pts had disease relapse and median time to relapse was 10.8 months (range; 8.2-16 months) C. Predictors of survival: In univariate analysis, that included age > 60 years, leukocyte count Hb, Plt, Blast percentage, mediastinal mass, LDH and CNS involvement, only age >60 and CNS involvement were predictors of inferior survival and both retained significance in the multivariable analysis with HR 3.9 (CI 1.5 - 9; p=0.0055) and 2.8 (1.3 - 5.7; p =0.0085), respectively (Figure 1 and 2). In this cohort age >60 was a better stratification that the conventionally used age above 40 (p = 0.1). Among 56 pts with evaluable cytogenetics data, 7 (13%) pts had MK which did not have an impact on survival with HR 1.9 (CI 0.4-5.6; p=0.33). Conclusion: In this large cohort of adult T-ALL patients, we observed that age >60 years and CNS involvement were independent predictors of inferior survival. MK was infrequent, but unlike in myeloid neoplasms, does not seem to impact overall survival. Figure 1. View large Download slide Figure 1. View large Download slide Figure 2.
