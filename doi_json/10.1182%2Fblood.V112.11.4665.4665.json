    "abstract_text": "Systematic models of anticoagulation management result in better clinical outcomes than routine medical care. At the University of Illinois at Chicago Medical Center (UIMCC) systematic anticoagulation management is provided via 2 models of care: a pharmacist managed antithrombosis clinic (PMATC) and a nurse managed anticoagulation clinic (NMAC). The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of oral anticoagulation management in these two models of care by assessing efficacy, safety, monitoring and resource utilization outcomes. A retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted between January 2005 and April 2007. A total of 200 patients, 100 in each group, were randomly selected and contributed 179.3 and 206.8 patient-years of therapy for the PMATC and NMAC respectively (p 60% of the time in therapeutic INR range had a lower median number of missed clinic monitoring appointments and a lower median number of deviations from the prescribed warfarin dose as compared to patients who spent < 60% of the time in the therapeutic INR range (1.8 vs 4.0, respectively; p=0.0002 and 9.1 vs. 12.8, respectively; p=0.02). In this study, the PMATC model showed better outcomes in attaining a faster therapeutic INR after initiating warfarin therapy and also demonstrated more judicious resource utilization by lower hospitalization rates and emergency room visits due to non-therapeutic INRs. Although the TTR was lower in the PMATC group, the 2 groups faired similarly with regards to clinical outcomes such as recurrent thromboembolism and major bleeding complications. The difference in TTR can be attributed to the higher proportion of more difficult to manage, non-compliant patients in the PMATC group. Both models of care were found to be well within acceptable limits of national benchmark quality data for systematic anticoagulation management, although the PMATC model had better resource utilization outcomes."
