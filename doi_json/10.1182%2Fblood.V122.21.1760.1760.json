    "abstract_text": "The prognostic value of dynamic monitoring C-reactive protein (CRP) serum levels in NK/T-cell lymphoma Background and Objective C-reactive protein (CRP) is a kind of acute phase protein against inflammatory reaction. CRP has been proved to be associated with prognosis in various malignancies. Yet, the prognostic value of CRP in natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NK/TCL) remains to be discussed. In this study, we aimed to observe the dynamic change of CRP serum levels during anti-lymphoma treatment, and to evaluate the prognostic value of CRP as a simple and economical biomarker during the early stage of treatment in patients with NK/T-cell lymphoma. Patients and Methods Between January 2003 and December 2011, 161 patients with newly diagnosed NK/TCL at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical and laboratory information was collected and analyzed. The following CRP serum levels were evaluated: pretreatment CRP (CRP 0 ), early-treatment CRP (CRP 1 , after one cycle of chemotherapy, or two or three weeks since beginning of radiation), and post-treatment CRP (CRP 2 , after first-line treatment, or failure of first-line treatment). Results Overall, 161 patients were reviewed and analyzed. The median age was 44 years (range, 11\u00a8C74). The majority had localized disease (stage I/ II; 75.5%). The CRP serum levels (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) were as follows: CRP 0 , 17.2\u00b123.1 mg/L; CRP 1 , 14.0\u00b130.0 mg/L; CRP 2 , 14.1\u00b127.0 mg/L. The pretreatment CRP serum levels correlated with others unfavorable factors, including serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ( P = 0.005), presence of bulky disease ( P = 0.002), presence of B symptoms ( P = 0.017), the International Prognostic Index (IPI) score ( P = 0.001) and the Korean Prognostic Index (KPI) score ( P = 0.001). By the time of the final follow up assessment (May 2013), the median follow-up time was 23.0 months (range, 1.0-106.0 months). The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 45.0 months (range, 1.0-106.0 months) and 32.0 months (range, 1.0-74.0 months), respectively. The independent unfavorable prognostic factors for OS (P < 0.05) in multivariate analysis included: elevated CRP 1 ( P < 0.001), presence of bulky disease ( P = 0.007), and elevated \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22-mg) serum levels ( P = 0.004). The receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed a similar cut-off value of CRP (8.16 mg/L) to the default value of the biochemical analyzer (8.2 mg/L). In addition, the result suggested a satisfying capacity of CRP 1 in predicting response to initial treatment (sensitivity 94%, specificity 74%) and 5-year OS (sensitivity 75%, specificity 90%), among different serum biomarkers, including EBV-DNA, LDH, \u03b22-mg, CRP 0 , CRP 1 , and CRP 2 . In all groups of patients classified according to dynamic CRP values, the patients with CRP 0 (+) /CRP 1 (-) presented the most favorable prognosis (5-year estimated OS: 72.5%). Conclusions Our study suggests that elevated early-treatment CRP is an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for patients with NK/TCL. Compared with the baseline CRP, the dynamic change of CRP levels may provide more important information for prognosis during treatment. Table.
