    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4268 Introduction: Ambulatory chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is believed to reduce exposure to nosocomial multi-drug resistant organisms and the incidence of septicemia. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective analysis we assessed the frequency of septicemia in patients receiving consolidation therapy: 256 patients received the first consolidation cycle (C1) and 217 the second consolidation cycle (C2). Patients received consolidation as inpatients or on an ambulatory basis. All ambulatory patients received infection prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin and fluconazole. Results: 71 cycles of IP and 402 cycles of ambulatory consolidation chemotherapy were administered. Rates of bacteremia were higher in the IP cohort compared to the ambulatory patients (39.4% vs. 26.6%, p=0.028). IP in C1 but not C2 had significantly more septicemia then the ambulatory cohort within that cycle. Relative to C1, C2 was associated with significantly more bacteremia (p=0.03) and more Escherichia coli isolates (p=0.023) but there was no significant difference in the rates of total Gram-positive organisms (79.2% vs. 70.4%, p=0.32), total Gram-negative organisms (20.7% vs. 28.1%, p=0.32) or Streptococcus isolates (17% vs. 23.9%, p=0.34). All Streptococcus isolates in C2 were sensitive to penicillin despite amoxicillin prophylaxis whereas all E. coli strains in C2 were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Conclusions: Ambulatory consolidation chemotherapy for AML is associated with a reduced incidence of septicemia. The second consolidation cycle is associated with a higher incidence of bacteremia accounted for by increased rates of ciprofloxacin resistant E. coli and penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus .
