    "abstract_text": "Background: The study of thrombotic events requires knowledge of changes in the hemostatic system associated with multiple acquired and hereditary risk factors that suggest predisposition to thrombosis. The factor V or Leiden (G1621A), Prothrombin (G21210A) and Methylenetetrahydrofolate redutase-MTHFR (C677T) mutations are the major genetic risk factors for venous thrombosis. This study assessed the frequency of mutations of the Factor V (Leiden), Prothrombin and MTHFR in patients with thrombophilia from the DNA Center Laboratory, Natal - RN. Methods: The detection of mutations was made by PCR-RFLP followed by enzymatic restriction with HindIII (Leiden and Prothrombin) and HinfI (MTHFR). Results: From 69 selected patients, 52 (75.36%) were females and 35 (24.64%) were males. The frequency of genotypes for the Factor V were: 3 mutated homozygous (4.35%), 4 heterozygous (5.80%) and 62 normal homozygous (89.85%). Regarding the mutation in the Prothrombin gene it was observed in 65 normal homozygous patients (94.2%) and 4 (5.8%) heterozygous. The analysis of the mutation in the gene MTHFR showed 35 (50.7%) normal homozygous patients, 5 (7.2%) mutated homozygous patients and 29 heterozygotes patients (42.1%). Conclusions: Approximately 50% of patients tested had at least one type of genetic alteration combined. Based on data obtained it is indicated the investigation of three markers (Factor V, Prothrombin and MTHFR) thrombophilia-related, targeting the real impact of the molecular mutations in thrombosis and the conduct of treatment.
