    "abstract_text": "CXCR4, receptor of the chemokine stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1), is expressed on CD34 + cells, and has been implicated in the process of CD34 + cell migration and homing. We studied the mobilization of CD34/CXCR4 cells and the plasma levels of SDF-1 and sgp130 in 22 patients, 11 acute Leukemia, 5 non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and 6 multiply myloma respectably, receiving cyclophosphamide (Cy) and plus G-CSF, or Mitoxantrone(Mit) and Cytarabine plus G-CSF for peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization and autotransplantation. We observed lower plasma levels of SDF-1 in PBSCs compared with premobilized PB and bone marrow samples. The average levels of SDF-1 and sgp130 were 24.67\u00b15.58ng/ml and 106.2\u00b116.4ng/ml respectively while the level of SDF-1 as well as sgp130 decreased to 14659\u00b12.11ng/ml(p<0.05)and 58.8\u00b129.1ng/ml(p<0.05) respectively on day when PBSC was collected after mobilization. SDF-1 levels in the apheresis collections of the \u201cgood mobilizers\u201d (patients who collected a minimum of 2 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg in one to three PBSC collections) were significantly lower than the apheresis collections of the \u201cpoor mobilizers\u201d (<2 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg in the three cycles of PBSC collections; 14.82 \u00b1 7.08 ng/ml versus 27.2 \u00b1 8.13 ng/ml; p<0.01). The mean percentage of CD34 + cells expressing CXCR4 in the apheresis collections was decreased in the PBSC collections compared with premobilization values ranging from 32.09\u00b15.39% to 22.4\u00b15.92%. But the mean CXCR4 expression on CD34 + cells of the good mobilizers was not different from the expression on CD34 + cells of poor mobilizers. Furthermore, the levels of sgp130 closely correlated with SDF-1 levels (r = 0.87; p < 0.001); the plasma level of SDF-1 and expression of CXCR4 on the CD34 + cells were gradually decreased in the PB of patients during the procession of mobilization; low plasma levels of SDF-1 turned out with good mobilization outcome, and the levels of SDF-1 correlated with sgp130, suggesting an association of these cytokines in mobilization of CD34 + cells."
