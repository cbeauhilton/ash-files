    "abstract_text": "Background and objective: In this article, four types of lymphoma cell lines U937, Raji, Hut-102, Akata, and three types of leukemia cell lines K562, HL-60, Jurkat were used the expression of SATB1 in leukemia cells, Through cell differentiation induced by all-TRANS Retinoic acid and DMSO, finds the SATB1 gene expression is reduced, suggest that the SATB1 gene may be involved in cell differentiation. By gene silencing, reduce the SATB1 gene expression, sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs is increased, suggest that the SATB1 gene may be associated with drug resistance. Methods: 1. Western Blot Assay for detection of SATB1 gene expression in cell lines. 2. DMSO and ATRA to HL-60, Jurkat cells for different times, SATB1 gene expression in the cells are detected by Western Blot. 3. Building SATB1-shRNA, transfected Jurkat cells and to HL-60. 4. Testing inhibition rate of chemotherapy drugs on HL-60, HL-60-SATB1-ctr, HL-60-SATB1-sh, Jurkat, Jurkat-SATB1-ctr, Jurkat-SATB1-sh cell, suggesting its relationship with the drug resistance. Results: 1. SATB1 gene was expression in all the plant cells. 2. The expression of SATB1 in U937, Raji, Hut-102, Akata four types of lymphoma cell line is low. 3. It was highly expression in HL-60, Jurkat cells, but low in K562. 4. DMSO and ATRA treat HL-60, Jurkat cells for 48 and 96 hours, HL-60 cells become larger, rounded, Jurkat cells into smaller, is more obvious for 96-hour. 5. For HL-60, Jurkat cells, after DMSO and ATRA treated, the expression of SATB1 was decreased, more obvious for 96-hour. 6. HL-60-SATB1-sh1, Jurkat-SATB1-sh1 cell compared with the control group, the SATB1 protein content decreased significantly, successfully building SATB1-shRNA HL-60 and Jurkat cell line. 7. HL-60-SATB1-sh1, and Jurkat-SATB1-sh1 of daunorubicin (DNR) sensitivity has improved significantly. Conclusion: 1. The SATB1 gene expression in leukemia and lymphoma cells, and higher expression in leukemia cells. 2. After DMSO and ATRA treatment, the SATB1 expression significantly reduced, suggest that SATB1 may be involved in cell differentiation. 3. Successfully built SATB1-shRNA, and successfully transferred to HL-60 and Jurkat cell lines. 4. HL-60-SATB1-sh1, and Jurkat-SATB1-sh1 of daunorubicin (DNR) sensitivity increased significantly, prompting SATB1 may be related to drug-resistance.
