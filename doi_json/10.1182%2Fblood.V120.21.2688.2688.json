    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2688 Members of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family of proteins function as secondary messengers mediating cellular responses to various cytokines. Aberrant activation of STAT5 protein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hematologic malignancies due to the ability of these transcription factors to regulate genes involved in cellular proliferation and survival. The two highly homologous transcription factors collectively known as STAT5, namely STAT5A and STAT5B, display both redundant and distinct physiologic functions in non-malignant B cells. Yet, despite evidence suggesting independent functions for STAT5A and STAT5B in the pathophysiology of solid tumors, the precise roles of these isoforms in hematologic malignancies such as Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) are not known. Initial immunohistochemical staining of WM bone marrow biopsies (n=6) revealed higher levels of STAT5 phosphorylation compared to bone marrows from normal controls (n=6). Additionally, phosphorylated STAT5 was highly expressed in CD19/CD138+ sorted cells obtained from the bone marrow of patients with WM (average \u0394MFI compared to isotype control, 4.64 +/\u2212 1.7, n=6) as determined by FACS analysis. Furthermore, western blotting demonstrated baseline STAT5 phosphorylation in both WM and IgM-secreting cell lines (MWCL-1 and BCWM-1, respectfully). The expression of other phosphorylated STAT proteins (1, 3, 4, and 6) was not detected. To better understand the overall role of STAT5 biologically in WM, MWCL-1 and BCWM.1 cells were treated with a specific inhibitor of STAT5, N\u2032-((4-Oxo-4H-chromen-3-yl)methylene) nicotinohydrazide. Following 72 hours in culture, this inhibitor significantly decreased IgM secretion at lower doses when compared to controls (10 \u03bcM, MWCL-1: 9413 +/\u2212 511 ng/mL vs. 6166 +/\u2212 160 ng/mL, p<0.001; BCWM.1: 13,380 +/\u2212 393 ng/mL +/\u2212 10970 +/\u2212 240 ng/mL, p<0.001) and nearly abolished IgM secretion at higher doses. Significant effects on proliferation and viability were also observed, but only at higher concentrations of drug where the specificity toward STAT5 may have diminished. To characterize the roles of the individual STAT5 isoforms in WM, we have developed doxycycline-inducible STAT5A-shRNA and STAT5B-shRNA and used these to create stable knockdowns in the MWCL-1 cell line. Addition of doxycycline to these cell lines for 72h nearly abolishes STAT5A or STAT5B protein expression, respectively, without affecting expression of the other isoform, while no change in STAT5 expression is detected in cells transduced with the empty vector (EV) control. The functional effects of isoform-specific STAT5 inhibition on WM tumor biology were assessed through proliferation assays and ELISA to determine the utility of therapeutically targeting a single STAT5 isoform. No difference in proliferation was observed in the STAT5A- or STAT5B-shRNA cells following 72h induction with doxycycline as compared to the EV control cells. However, specific knockdown of STAT5A following doxycycline induction significantly decreased IgM secretion as compared to the EV control (EV, 91.8 +/\u2212 10.2% of baseline secretion, STAT5A, 66.7 +/\u2212 15.1% of baseline, p<0.05), whereas IgM secretion was decreased by knockdown of STAT5B but not significantly. Similarly, IL-6 secretion was only diminished in cells lacking STAT5A as compared to EV cells (EV, 94 +/\u2212 14.16% of baseline secretion; STAT5A, 64% +/\u2212 7.6% of baseline, p<0.001). Overall these initial data indicate a role for isoform-specific STAT5 activation in the maintenance of WM tumors, and future studies will further our understanding of the specific roles of STAT5A and STAT5B in WM tumors.
