    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1943 Poster Board I-966 Introduction: ALK + anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) overexpress C/EBP\u03b2, as a consequence of NPM-ALK kinase activity. We recently reported C/EBP\u03b2 as a transcription regulator of NPM-ALK induced cellular proliferation. To identify the downstream targets of C/EBP\u03b2 that might be responsible for cell proliferation and survival, we performed gene expression profiling and pathway analyses after C/EBP\u03b2 gene silencing Materials and Methods: C/EBP\u03b2 knockdown was done by lentiviral shRNA-transduction into two ALK + ALCL cell lines with strong C/EBP\u03b2 expression \u2013 SUDHL1 and KiJK. At day three after infection, RNA was extracted and used for Gene Chip expression analysis (U133 Plus 2.0 arrays/ Affymetrix). Genes regulated in both cell lines were applied to Genomatix Bibliosphere Pathway analysis. Candidate genes were either strongly influenced by C/EBP\u03b2 knockdown, or had promoter binding sites for C/EBP\u03b2, or showed remarkable pathway connections. The influence of C/EBP\u03b2 on these genes was validated by qRT-PCR and in part by Western blot. Results: Gene expression profiling analysis resulted in 167 genes being regulated in both cell lines, of which 26 genes were chosen for further analysis. Validation by qRT-PCR confirmed 23/26 genes. Pathway analysis revealed c-Jun, which is a member of the dimeric transcription factor AP-1, as a regulator of C/EBP\u03b2 expression. Silencing C/EBP\u03b2 led to a clear up-regulation of c-Jun mRNA. Western blot analysis demonstrated that C/EBP\u03b2 influenced not only the expression of c-Jun but also its phosphorylation on Ser63 and Ser73. In contrast to what has been reported, we found very low levels of c-Jun expression in ALK + ALCL cells lines and its expression correlated inversely with C/EBP\u03b2 mRNA levels. Although it has been shown that c-Jun regulates C/EBP\u03b2 expression directly, in ALK + ALCL the expression of C/EBP\u03b2 is clearly independent of c-Jun. Our data suggest that c-Jun up-regulation after C/EBP\u03b2 knockdown is a compensatory mechanism to maintain C/EBP\u03b2 expression. Additionally, of the 26 selected genes, Bibliosphere Analysis identified 12 genes, which might be transcriptionally regulated by C/EBP\u03b2 and are primary targets in C/EBP\u03b2 downstream signalling. Two of these genes are of particular interest. The anti-apoptotic protein BCL2A1 contains a promoter-binding site for C/EBP\u03b2 and has been shown previously to be both strongly regulated in ALK + ALCL and absolutely necessary for its transformation. The second is a DEAD box nucleolar RNA helicase protein involved in ribosomal RNA production and proliferation which we found to be strongly expressed in ALK + ALCL cell lines and primary cases. Conclusions: C/EBP\u03b2 silencing in ALK + ALCL cell lines showed 1) an inverse correlation between c-Jun and C/EBP\u03b2 mRNA expression levels, 2) the expression of C/EBP\u03b2 in ALK + ALCL is independent of c-Jun, 3) genes transcriptionally regulated by C/EBP\u03b2 seem to be essential for proliferation and survival in ALK + ALCL.
