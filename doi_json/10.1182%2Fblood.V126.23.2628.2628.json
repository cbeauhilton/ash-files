    "abstract_text": "T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) accounts for 10% to 15% of newly diagnosed cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Although gene fusions generated through chromosomal translocations, deletions, and inversions are the most frequent genetic abnormalities detected in other types of leukemia, recurrent gene fusions except for SIL-TAL1 have been poorly defined in T-ALL. To discover driver mutations or fusion genes, which involved in the pathogenesis of childhood T-ALL and to identify novel prognostic markers of childhood T-ALL, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptome sequencing (WTS) in 31 and 46 cases, respectively. We also performed SNP array karyotyping in 46 cases. To detect somatic mutations or fusion transcripts, we used our pipeline \"Genomon-exome\" and \"Genomon-fusion\" algorithm. Subsequently, somatic mutations were validated using deep amplicon sequencing. Candidate fusion transcripts were validated by reverse - transcription polymerase-chain-reaction and Sanger sequencing.Recurrent mutations observed in more than 3 cases were detected in NOTCH1 (n = 18, 58%), FBXW7 (n = 7, 23%), PHF6 (n = 5, 16%), GATA3 (n = 4, 13%), MYB (n = 3, 10%), and NRAS (n = 3, 10%), respectively. We identified previously known fusion genes, such as MLL-ENL (n = 2), CALM-AF10 (n = 2), NUP214-ABL1 (n = 1) and FGFROP1-FGFR1 (n = 1). MLL-ENL is one of the frequent translocation in infant multilineage leukemia, but also reported in non-infant B cell precursor ALL and T-ALL. FGFR1OP is ubiquitously expressed, and the predicted chimeric FGFR1OP-FGFR1 protein contains the catalytic domain of FGFR1. It is thought to promote hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and leukemogenesis through a constitutive phosphorylation and activation of the downstream pathway of FGFR1. CALM-AF10 leukemia is reported to increase HOXA cluster gene transcription, we could also confirm elevated HOXA genes expression by FPKM value. Four SIL-TAL1 fusions were detected in our cohort. Recently, a novel mutation in TAL1 enhancer region which introduce de novo MYB biding site has been reported. Since this abnormality lead high expression of TAL1, we also analyzed expression data obtained from WTS. Among 46 specimens, 19 samples showed high expression of TAL1 (FPKM value \u22655). In those cases, 4 cases had SIL-TAL1 fusions (8%), and 3 cases (6%) had insertions in enhancer region of TAL1. Subsequent analysis using Gene Set Enrich Analysis (GSEA) between TAL1 high and low expression samples revealed that \"LEE_EARLY_T_LYMPHOCYTE_UP\" was enriched in TAL1 high expression samples (Enrichment score = 0.73, FDR = 0.073). This gene set includes genes up-regulated at early stages of progenitor T lymphocyte maturation compared to the late stages, and MYB was included in this gene set. Intriguingly, MYB mutation samples were not represented TAL1 high expression. TAL1 related rearrangement or enhancer insertion was not detected in the rest of 12 cases with TAL1 high expression, suggesting that other mechanisms of TAL1 high expression might be exist. In conclusion, although NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations were relatively frequently detected in our series, we also found recurrent MYB mutations. SIL-TAL1 was known as most frequent rearrangement, TAL1 enhancer insertions were also frequent in TAL1 overexpressed samples. TAL1 enhancer insertion and MYB mutation was exclusive, suggesting that TAL1 and MYB have a key role in childhood T-ALL. Consistent with other reports, frequent translocations were not observed in T-ALL, suggesting the genetic differences between T-ALL and other hematological malignancies. Further studies will be necessary to unravel oncogenic mechanisms that implicated in new therapeutic strategy for childhood T-ALL. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
