    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic transplantation following a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) has emerged as an alternative to myeloablative transplantation in pts with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Given the uncertainty regarding the most appropriate conditioning regimen, SFGM-TC conducted a retrospective multicenter study in the attempt to evaluate the impact of conditioning on pts\u2019 outcome. The record of 61 pts (37 males) with MDS who received a RIC were reviewed. The median age was 55 years (range: 18\u201370). According to the FAB classification, 11 pts had RA at diagnosis, of whom one had progressed to REAB and one to AML before transplantation. Thirty two pts had REAB at diagnosis, of whom 2 had progressed to REAB-T and 7 to AML before transplantation. Twelve pts had REAB-T at diagnosis and 6 CMML, of whom 8 progressed to AML before transplantation. The median time from diagnosis to RIC was 12 months (6\u2013129). Conditioning consisted of Fludarabin (Flu) plus busulfan (FB; n=29), Flu plus 2-Gy TBI (F-TBI; n=20) and idarubicin plus aracytine and Flu (FlagIda; n=12). Donors were HLA-identical siblings (n=52) and HLA-matched unrelated (n=9). All pts received peripheral blood stem cells. The median of CD34+ infused cell dose was 5 x 10 6 /kg (0.5\u201317.3). The median follow-up was 44.7 months (21\u201385). Estimated 3-year overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), relapse and transplant-relapse mortality (TRM) were 35%, 27%, 66% and 30%, respectively. Neither of the 3 conditioning regimens used (FB, F-TBI and FlagIda) had impact on patients\u2019 outcome. In multivariable analyses, while acute III/IV grade GVHD development was the only factor found to adversely influencing OS (HR=3.6; 95% CI: 1.1\u201312.2), chronic GVHD development was the only favourably influencing PFS and relapse ratios (HR=0.3; 95% CI: 0.1\u20130.7 and HR=0.2; 95% CI: 0.1\u20130.6, respectively). TRM was adversely influenced by male sex of recipient (HR=9.2; 95% CI: 1.5\u201366.6). RIC is an effective treatment in MDS patients irrespective of conditioning type. While acute III/IV grade GVHD appeared to be detrimental, the benefit effect of chronic GVHD was to be bound to GVL effect as demonstrated by the improvement of PFS and relapse rates in patients who developed chronic GVHD. This study shows no impact of conditioning in pts\u2019 outcomes. New approaches with focus on immunosuppressive treatment are needed to enhance the GVL effect with an acceptable risk of GVHD."
