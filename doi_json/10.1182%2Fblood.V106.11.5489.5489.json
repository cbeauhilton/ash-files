    "abstract_text": "From 1996 to 2003, 113 consecutive patients with multiple myeloma were treated with four different high dose approaches rescued by autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) after four cycles of VAD or other combinations. The median age was 53 years 31\u201368), 58% were male and 42% female, the median interval from diagnosis to transplant was 252 days (range 160\u20133116 days). Twenty-five patients received as preparative regimen Carmustine, Etoposide and Melphalan (BVM) at the total dose of 600 mg/m2, 900mg/m2 and 140\u2013180 mg m2 respectively. Nineteen pts had as preparative regimen Thiotepa and Melphalan at the total dose of 10 mg/kg and 140\u2013180 mg/m2 respectively, 38 pts received a double transplant with Melphalan given as a single agent at the dose of 200 mg/m2, while 31 pts received a single transplant with Melphalan 200 mg/m2. In patients with poor performance status at transplant or previous history of infection or renal impairment, the dose of melphalan was reduced by 20% respect to the standard planned dose. in the group of 25patients treated by BVM, 10 had progressive disease, 6 stable disease (SD), 7 partial remission (PR), 1 very good partial remission (VGPR). At day +90 from transplant, 17 patients were in CR or PR (68%). The actuarial probability of overall survival and event free survival at 5 years were 40% and 20%, respectively. One pt died of transplant, one developed a solid tumor 24 mos after transplant. in the group of 19 pts treated with TT and Mel (TT-Mel), 3 pts were with progressive disease, 3 with stable disease, 6 in partial remission, 3 with minimal response, 3 in VGPR, 1 in CR. At day +90, 15 pts were in CR or PR (78%). The actuarial probability of survival was 50% at 5 years, and event free survival 28%. in the group of 38 pts who received a double transplant, 7 pts were with progressive disease, 3 with stable disease, 14 in PR, 12 in VGPR or CR. At day +90 after the second transplant, 31 of 38 patients (81%) were in CR or PR. Overall survival and event free survival was respectively 48% and 20% at five years. in the group of 31 pts receiving a single transplant with Melphalan alone, 8 were with progressive disease, 1 with stable disease, 6 in VGPR, 1 in CR, 13 in PR. At day +90, 21 of 31 patients (67%) were in CR or PR. Overall survival and event free survival was respectively 45% and 22% at five years. In conclusion, double transplant seems better than one transplant with melphalan alone in terms of EFS and OS (p<0.03); the BVM combination produces high response rates, the regimen, however, is toxic with a high rate of life threatening mucositis. the addition of Carmustine and Vepeside or Thiotepa to Melphalan does not produce significant improvement of OS and EFS.",
