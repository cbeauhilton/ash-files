However, it is unclear whether shortened sleep duration in the absence of disordered breathing is associated with higher levels of hemostatic factors. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 582 community-dwelling adults were randomly sampled. They underwent polysomnography to determine the apnea hypopnea index (AHI), a measure of sleep disordered breathing, and wrist actigraphy for 7 nights to assess sleep duration. A morning blood sample was collected for measurements of factor VIII (FVIII), von Willebrand Factor (vWF), thrombin antithrombin complexes (TAT), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Logistic regression analyses were used to model the odds of being in the upper quintile of each hemostatic factor by AHI score or sleep duration. Results: Participant ages ranged from 35 to 65 (mean 48), with 57% women and 30% Blacks. Hypertension was present in 18% and diabetes in 6%. The mean (SD) sleep duration was 7 (1. 07) hours/day, and 34% had an AHI \u22655. Mean values (SD) for hemostatic factors were FVIII (U/ml), 1. 06 (0. 41); vWF (U/ml), 1. 21 (0. 51); TAT (ng/ml), 2. 66 (2. 25); and PAI-1(ng/ml), 23. 4 (21. 4). vWF increased with age and FVIII, vWF, and TAT were higher in Blacks vs Whites. Associations (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval) were observed for FVIII with diabetes (3. 16, 1. 36\u20137. 32) and PAI-1 with hypertension (1. 9, 1. 06\u20133. 41) and diabetes (2. 58, 1. 15\u20135. 76) after adjustment for demographic and cardiovascular covariates. In unadjusted analyses, participants with AHI \u22655 had elevated levels of FVIII and vWF, but this association was attenuated after adjustment for demographic and cardiovascular covariates (see Table). However, AHI \u22655 remained significantly associated with elevated PAI-1 in fully adjusted models. The majority of participants (90%) had a low likelihood of apnea (AHI <15), and their sleep duration showed no associations with hemostatic factors in any model. Table.
