    "abstract_text": "Abstract 181 Studies conducted over the past decade have revealed a strong association between the mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV) genes and clinical course in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In patients with aggressive CLL, the leukemic cells typically express B cell receptors (BCRs) encoded by unmutated IGHV genes, whereas these genes are most often mutated in leukemic cells from patients with indolent disease. The mutational status of the IGHV genes reflects features of the antigen, such as antigen structure, form, presentation and affinity, indicating that the difference in the clinical course between IGHV-unmutated and IGHV-mutated CLL could be due to recognition of different types of antigens. In line with this possibility, recent studies have shown that IGHV-unmutated CLL (U-CLL) cells frequently express polyreactive BCRs that bind with low affinity to both microbial antigens and autoantigens translocated or exposed on apoptotic cells, whereas such reactivity is infrequent in IGHV-mutated CLL (M-CLL). To further explore the possibility that the clinical course in CLL is determined by the availability of particular types of antigenic stimuli, we investigated the impact of different antigen/BCR interactions on leukemia development and behavior in the E\u03bc-TCL1 transgenic mouse model of CLL. We initially established three cohorts of E\u03bc-TCL1 transgenic mice that expressed transgenic BCRs with different antigen specificity. Two of these cohorts expressed low-affinity unmutated transgenic BCRs reactive with the antigens phosphatidylcholine (PtC) and Sm (IgPtC and IgSm, respectively), whereas the third cohort expressed a high-affinity mutated transgenic BCR (IgHEL) specific for the antigen hen egg lysozyme (HEL). Of note, Sm is a ribonucleoprotein complex that is translocated to the surface of apoptotic cells and has been shown to be recognized by certain human U-CLL BCRs, whereas PtC is a cell membrane component that is exposed on senescent red blood cells and gut bacteria. Because no data are currently available regarding the reactivity of the M-CLL BCRs, we subdivided the cohort of E\u03bc-TCL1/IgHEL double transgenic mice into four additional cohorts. These included a cohort without antigen (E\u03bc-TCL1/IgHEL), a cohort in which HEL was provided as a foreign antigen (E\u03bc-TCL1/IgHEL double transgenic mice repetitively immunized with particles coated with HEL and CpG oligonucleotides), a cohort in which HEL was provided as a soluble autoantigen (E\u03bc-TCL1/IgHEL/sHEL triple transgenic mice) and a cohort in which HEL was provided as a membrane-bound autoantigen exposed on apoptotic cells (E\u03bc-TCL1/IgHEL/mHEL-KK triple transgenic mice). Each cohort consisted of 12\u201314 animals, of which at least 8 have been followed for >1 year. Animals from all cohorts developed CD5-positive B cell leukemias, but only in E\u03bc-TCL1/IgSm and E\u03bc-TCL1/IgPtC mice the leukemic cells expressed a transgenic BCR. In E\u03bc-TCL1/IgHEL mice the leukemias were always derived from the small percentage of B cells that express an endogenous BCR, whereas B cells that express the transgenic IgHEL BCR were never transformed. Interestingly, leukemia development and progression was more rapid in E\u03bc-TCL1/IgPtC than E\u03bc-TCL1/IgSm transgenic mice (7/14 at 6 months of age and 2/10 at 8 months of age, respectively). Since PtC is expressed as both a foreign- (gut flora) and self- (senescent red blood cells) antigen, we investigated whether suppression of gut flora will affect the growth of adoptively transferred E\u03bc-TCL1/IgPtC leukemias. Pretreatment of syngeneic recipient mice with a three-week course of broad-spectrum antibiotics significantly delayed leukemia growth, suggesting that PtC is more potent in driving the expansion of the leukemic clone when expressed as a foreign than self antigen. To summarize, these data demonstrate that U-CLL can be induced by both microbial antigens and autoantigens exposed on apoptotic cells, including autoantigens that are recognized by human CLL cells, such as Sm. In contrast, M-CLL can not be induced by chronic or repetitive antigen stimulation, regardless whether the antigen is provided as a foreign antigen, as a soluble autoantigen, or as a membrane-bound autoantigen exposed on apoptotic cells. Collectively, these data suggest that the mechanisms that drive U-CLL and M-CLL are different and indicate that only U-CLL is an antigen-driven disease.
