    "abstract_text": "Background and Rationale : Multiple Myeloma (MM) remains incurable despite the advent of novel drugs, highlighting the need for further identification of factors mediating disease progression and resistance. The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment confers growth, survival, and drug resistance in MM cells. Studies to date suggest an important role of BM hypoxia (low oxygenation) in MM cell survival, drug resistance, migration, and metastasis. Therapies targeting the MM cell in its BM milieu under hypoxic conditions may therefore achieve responses in patients resistant to various therapies. Recent studies led to the development of a novel aerospace-industry derived Phase 2 molecule RRx-001 with epigenetic and NO-donating properties. RRx-001 generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), which induces oxidative stress in tumor cells. Importantly, RRx-001 is also a potent vascular disrupting agent, which further provides rationale for utilizing RRx-001 as a therapeutic agent since tumor-associated angiogenesis is a characteristic of MM. A Phase I clinical trial has shown RRx-001 to have antitumor activity in heavily pretreated cancer patients and to be safe and well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities ( Reid et al. J Clin Oncol 32:5s, 2014 suppl; abstr 2578 ). Here we examined the anti-MM activity of RRx-001 using in vitro and in vivo models of MM. Materials and methods : MM cell lines, patient MM cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from normal healthy donors were utilized to assess the anti-MM activity of RRx-001 alone or in combination with other agents. Drug sensitivity, cell viability, apoptosis, and migration assays were performed using WST, MTT, Annexin V staining, and transwell Inserts, respectively. Synergistic/additive anti-MM activity was assessed by isobologram analysisusing \u201cCalcuSyn\u201d software program. Signal transduction pathways were evaluated using immunoblotting. ROS release, nitric oxide generation, and mitochondrial membrane potential was measured as previously described (Chauhan et al., Blood, 2004, 104:2458). In vitro angiogenesis was assessed using matrigel capillary-like tube structure formation assays. DNMT1 activity was measured in protein lysates using EpiQuik DNMT1 assay kit. 5-methyl cytosine levels were analyzed in gDNA samples using methylflash methylated DNA quantification kit from Enzo life sciences; USA. For xenograft mouse model, CB-17 SCID-mice were subcutaneously inoculated with MM.1S cells as previously described (Chauhan et al., Blood, 2010, 115:834). Statistical significance of data was determined using a Student\u2019s t test. RRx-001 was obtained from RadioRx Inc., CA, USA; bortezomib, SAHA, and pomalidomide were purchased from Selleck chemicals, USA. Results : Treatment of MM cell lines (MM.1S, MM.1R, RPMI-8226, OPM2, H929, Dox-40 ARP-1, KMS-11, ANBL6.WT, ANBL6.BR, and LR5) and primary patient cells for 24h significantly decreased their viability (IC 50 range 1.25nM to 2.5nM) (p < 0.001; n=3) without markedly affecting PBMCs from normal healthy donors, suggesting specific anti-MM activity and a favorable therapeutic index for RRx-001. Tumor cells from 3 of 5 patients were obtained from patients whose disease was progressing while on bortezomib, dexamethasone, and lenalidomide therapies. Moreover, RRx-001 inhibits proliferation of MM cells even in the presence of BM stromal cells. Mechanistic studies show that RRx-001-triggered apoptosis is associated with 1) induction of DNA damage response signaling via ATM/p53/gH2AX axis; 2) activation of caspases mediating both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways; 3) increase in oxidative stress through release of ROS and generation of NO; and 4) decrease in DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) enzymatic activity and global methylation levels. Furthermore, RRx-001 blocked migration of MM cells and angiogenesis. In vivo studies using subcutaneous human MM xenograft models show that RRx-001 is well tolerated and inhibits tumor growth. Finally, combining RRx-001 with bortezomib, SAHA, or pomalidomide induces synergistic anti-MM activity and overcomes drug resistance. Conclusion : Our preclinical studies showing efficacy of RRx-001 in MM disease models provide the framework for clinical trial of RRx-001, either alone or in combination, to improve outcome in relapsed and refractory MM patients.
