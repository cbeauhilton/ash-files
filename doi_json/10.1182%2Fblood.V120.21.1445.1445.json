    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1445 Models for the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) imply the role of individual genetic variations in genes involved in detoxification mechanisms. GSTP1 enzyme plays a key role in detoxification of a variety of electrophilic compounds, such as benzo [a]-pyrene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), chemotherapy drugs and products of oxidative stress. GSTP1 acts through a common mechanism of conjugating reactive oxygen species (ROS) with glutathione, enabling their detoxification and elimination and thus defending tissues against DNA damage. The corresponding gene is subject to a single-nucleotide polymorphism (A313G) leading to abolished enzyme activity. Thus, individuals homozygous for the variant G allele (G/G) have a lower conjugating activity than individuals homozygous for the wild type A allele (A/A), while heterozygotes (A/G) display intermediate activity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the GSTP1 polymorphism influences susceptibility to MDS and/or promote specific chromosomal aberrations. We conducted a case-control study in 310 de novo MDS patients and 370 unrelated healthy controls using both a conventional PCR-RFLP assay and a novel Real-Time PCR genotyping method using hybridization probe technology. The GSTP1 gene status was also evaluated in relation to patients' characteristics and chromosomal abnormalities. Comparison of the genotype distribution between controls and MDS cases revealed a significantly higher frequency of the variant genotypes (heterozygotes A/A and homozygotes G/G) among MDS patients, as compared to controls ( p <0.0001, \u03c7 2 =31.167, df=2). The most marked statistical difference between MDS patients and controls was observed between the wild-type (A/A) and the homozygous variant genotype (G/G), since subjects carrying the G/G variant genotype showed a 4.1-fold increased risk of MDS prevalence than subjects carrying the wild-type A/A genotype ( p =0.000, \u03c7 2 =30.5, d.f.=1, OR=4.098, 95%CI=[2.433\u20136.897]). Allele frequencies distribution analysis between patients and controls, showed that MDS patients exhibited a 1.9-fold increased risk of carrying at least one variant G allele, as compared to the controls ( p <0.0001, d.f.=1, OR =1.9, 95%CI=[1.48\u20132.34]). There was no association between the GSTP1 polymorphism and gender or any specific cytogenetic subgroup, while stratification of patients according to age showed a differential GSTP1 genotype distribution ( p =0.007). Our results, derived from the larger series of primary MDS cases tested for the GSTP1 genetic background, reveal an increased incidence of the GSTP1 variant genotypes among MDS patients, providing evidence for a potential pathogenetic role of the GSTP1 polymorphism on de novo MDS risk.
