    "abstract_text": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a rare malignancy in children and is mostly diagnosed in the chronic phase (CP). In adults, the five-year overall survival rate is 89% for patients on Imatinib and disease progression occurs in 1-3% per year (Druker 2006). Once a blast crisis (BC) has occurred, treatment options are limited with a median survival of only a few months (Cortes 2008). Therefore, early recognition of patients at risk for developing a BC is desirable. Besides the translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), IKZF1, PAX5, and CDKN2A deletions have been reported in CML lymphoid blast crisis (LyBC) of both adult and pediatric patients (Mullighan 2008, Alp\u00e1r 2012). The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of IKZF1 deletions and other copy number alterations (CNAs) by MLPA analysis in a large cohort of pediatric CML patients at time of diagnosis in order to determine whether CNAs commonly found in pediatric ALL might predict disease progression and / or treatment response. Between October 1991 and October 2012 a total of 86 children with newly diagnosed CML were included. The median follow up was 31 months. Among the 86 patients, 82 patients were diagnosed in CP, 2 patients in accelerated phase (AP), and 2 patients in LyBC. Six patients experienced progression to a BC respectively a myeloid blast crisis (MyBC) (N=2) and LyBC (N=4). At time of diagnosis, an IKZF1 deletion was detected in one patient diagnosed with CML-AP ( Table A , patient no 58). IKZF1 and EBF1 deletions were detected in one patient diagnosed with CML-LyBC ( Table A , patient no 22). No CNAs were detected in the 82 patients diagnosed with CML-CP.    View Large At time of disease progression, new CNAs were detected at time of the LyBC ( Table A , patient no 62, 64, and 67). Due to the absence of material no CNAs could be detected in both patients experiencing a MyBC. In conclusion, we were able to detect CNAs in progressive CML disease (CML-AP and CML-LyBC) and not in the samples at the time of chronic phase in this large pediatric cohort of CML patients. Therefore, the investigated CNAs could not be used to predict disease progression at time of diagnosis. The CNAs detected in patients with progressive CML were similar to specific CNAs detected in pediatric B-cell precursor ALL, indicating a similar disease development (Kuiper 2010). Additionally, our results are in accordance with existing literature, suggesting that mechanisms of disease progression in pediatric and adult CML might be similar (Brazma, 2007).
