    "abstract_text": "Background: Clinical trials to mobilize PBPC for autologous and allogeneic harvesting prior to high dose chemotherapy/radiotherapy include chemotherapy, cytokines, or chemotherapy combine with cytokines. PBPC mobilized by G-CSF or GM-CSF reduces the hematological toxicity and supportive care requirements in recipients of autologous and allogeneic transplants, in our study we combined G-CSF and GM-CSF to mobilize PBPC for transplantation. Methods: We selected 63 patients with different cancers to participate in the study and 7 healthy donors. We utilize to mobilize in all the patient the combination of G-CSF and GM-CSF (10\u03bcg/Kg/day each) administered for 5 consecutive days. Then we proceed it to harvest the PBPC until we obtain a threshold of 2.0 x 10^6/Kg CD34+ cells. A total of 31 PBPC transplants were performed (27 autologous and 8 allogeneic). Neutrophil engraftment was defined as ANC> 500/mm\u00b3 and, platelet engraftment was defined as a platelet count > 30,000/mm\u00b3 (transfusion independent) for more than 48 hours. Results: Data on PBC 24, 48, 72, and 96hrs. For the 31 PBPC autologous transplant patients, the median days to ANC>500 was 10.6 days; 11 days for the allogeneic. None of the subject's experience bone pain, headache, flu like side effects or a documented or proven infection. Median days to platelet engraftment following infusion CD34+ cells, was 13.2 for the autologous PBPC; 13 days for the allogeneic. Conclusions: The combination the G-CSF and GM-CSF (10\u03bcg/kg/day x 5 days) was well tolerated. We can appreciate that there is a reduction in the duration and severity of neutropenia as well of thrombocytopenia in both types of transplant (autologous/allogeneic). The GVHD incidence were not increase by the use of G-CSF and GM-CSF. We conclude that this procedure is cost effective and a suitable way to mobilize an average number of PBPC (from 1-3 apheresis) in a shorter amount of time indicating an economic advantage. It is proven to be less expensive than other agent used to mobilize stems cells for transplant. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
