As with most cytokines, the short serum half-life and severe side effects of IFN-a\u03012 are major factors affecting its dosing schedule and efficacy. Fusion or conjugation of IFN-a\u03012 to a tumor-targeting IgG has the potential to enhance in vivo potency due to increased tumor localization and more favorable pharmacokinetics. We have recently demonstrated that 20-2b, a monospecific immunocytokine generated by the dock-and-lock (DNL) method to comprise tetrameric IFN-a\u03012b covalently linked to veltuzumab, a humanized anti-CD20 mAb, exhibited very potent anti-tumor activity in vitro and in human lymphoma xenografts (Rossi et al., Blood , in press). However, lymphomas and leukemias that express little or no CD20 are expected to be resistant to therapy with 20-2b. HLA-DR is expressed on many hematopoietic tumors and some solid cancers. A bispecific immunocytokine that could target IFN-a\u0301 to both CD20 and HLA-DR might be a more effective therapeutic against a wide variety of hematopoietic malignancies, including those that express CD20, HLA-DR, or both. Since each component of the multifunctional complex (veltuzumab, anti-HLA-DR F(ab) 2, and IFN-a\u03012b) has anti-tumor activity independently, we evaluated if the bispecific immunocytokine can potentially be even more potent than the monospecific immunocytokine, 20-2b. Methods One strategy of the modular DNL method is to fuse either the dimerization-and-docking domain (DDD) derived from protein kinase A, or the anchoring domain (AD) of a cognate A-kinase anchoring protein, to a biological entity, resulting in respective DDD- and AD-modules that are readily combined to quantitatively generate stably-tethered structures of defined composition with retained bioactivity. We have selectively combined recombinant DDD-modules of both IFN-a\u03012b and anti-HLA-DR Fab (derived from humanized L243) together with a recombinant AD-module of anti-CD20 IgG (veltuzumab) to generate the first bispecific antibody-based immunocytokine, designated 20-C2-2b, which comprises two copies of IFN-a\u03012b and a stabilized F(ab) 2 of hL243 site-specifically linked to veltuzumab. Results Each of the three modules, veltuzumab-AD, hL243-Fab-DDD, and IFN-a\u03012b-DDD, was produced recombinantly in separate myeloma cell cultures. Combining equimolar amounts of the three modules under mild redox conditions resulted in the formation of 20-C2-2b, which was purified by sequential chromatographic processes involving Protein A, IMAC and anion exchange chromatography to remove potential side-products such as 20-2b and 20-C2 (the hexavalent bispecific antibody comprising veltuzumab and four Fabs of hL243). Size-exclusion HPLC analysis indicated a major peak of a retention time consistent with a \u223c310 kDa protein. Reducing SDS-PAGE of 20-C2-2b revealed the presence of all three constituents. The complex was immunoreactive with an anti-IFN-a\u03012b, an anti-idiotype to hL243, as well as an anti-idiotype to veltuzumab, and showed increased binding to Raji lymphoma cells compared to either veltuzumab or hL243. More importantly, 20-C2-2b was found to be extremely cytotoxic to Daudi, an IFNa\u0301-sensitive Burkitt lymphoma cell line, having an IC 50 = 0.035 pM, which was 100,000-fold more potent than hL243 IgG, 100-fold more potent than a combination of veltuzumab, hL243 IgG and a structural analog comprising an irrelevant IgG and IFN-a\u03012b, and 5-fold more potent than 20-2b. In the same assay, we have also determined that 20-C2-2b was about 2-fold more potent than C2-2b, which comprises hL243 IgG linked to four molecules of IFN-a\u03012b. Conclusions The DNL method provides a modular approach to enable the creation of novel multifunctional complexes. Based on our experience with 20-2b, the bispecific immunocytokine 20-C2-2b is expected to have greater in vivo potency than IFN-a\u0301 due to improved pharmacokinetics and endowed targeting specificity, and may potentially be useful for therapy of a variety of hematopoietic tumors that express either CD20 or HLA-DR.
