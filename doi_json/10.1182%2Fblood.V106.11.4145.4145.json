    "abstract_text": "Objetives: To describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of patients with carotid and vertebral artery dissection (CAD, VAD). Design: Retrospective, observational Patients and methods: Clinical recording were evaluated from 1996 to 2005; 6 patients (3 women, 3 men, mean age 37 years) with CAD (3) and VAD (3) were referred to our hematology unit. Clinical presentation: progressing stroke 4/6 and transient ischemic attack (TIA) 2/6; warning sings and symptoms preceding the onset of stroke in 80%. Vascular risk factors included smoking and hypertension; associated features were headache, visual symptoms and Horner\u2019s syndrome; Predisposing factors as physical exercise and trauma were found in 4/6. One patient was at 20 weeks of pregnancy. Diagnosis: Diagnostic tests included: Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography (MRA). On admission angiographic studies showed occlusion or stenoses of dissected arteries. Treatment: Anticoagulation with heparin or low molecular weight heparin followed by oral anticoagulants. Outcome: No hemorrhagic complication, no recurrence, complete recovery in 5 patients and mild dysarthria in one. Conclusion: TIA and progressing stroke in young patients are presenting features of CAD and VAD. The diagnosis is based on clinical signs and confirming angiographic investigation. Our experience shows that anticoagulation is the treatment of choice, although controlled studies to show their effectiveness are lacking.",
