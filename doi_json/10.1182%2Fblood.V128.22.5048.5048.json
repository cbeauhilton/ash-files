    "abstract_text": "RGS family proteins are known to negatively regulate G-protein-coupled receptor signaling through their GTPase-accelerating activity. In several types of hematopoietic cells (e.g., B lymphocytes and megakaryocytes), responses to stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are subjected to regulation by R4 subfamily RGS proteins. However, their expression patterns and functional roles in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSC) are poorly characterized. Here, we showed that human CD34+ HSC derived from cord blood (CB, n = 10) expressed 7 out of 10 R4 RGS proteins at mRNA level (RGS1-3, 5, 13, 16 and 18), whereas expressions of RGS4, 8 and 21 were undetectable. Exposure of CB CD34+ cells to SDF-1 significantly increased RGS1, 2, 13 and 16 expressions and decreased RGS3 and 18 expressions ( P \u2264 0.0402, n = 5). Expressions of RGS1, 13 and 16 were significantly higher in bone marrow (BM, n = 10) CD34+ cells when compared to mobilized peripheral blood (MPB, n = 5) CD34+ cells ( P \u2264 0.0160), while RGS3 and 18 expressions were lower in BM CD34+ cells ( P \u2264 0.0471), suggesting a SDF-1- and niche-dependent regulation of RGS expressions. To investigate the potential involvement of RGS proteins in SDF-1-mediated homing-related functions, we introduced RGS overexpression constructs into CB CD34+ cells by lentiviral transduction. With >80% transduction efficiency, we showed that overexpression of RGS1, 13 and 16 but not RGS2 significantly inhibited migration of CD34+ cells to a SDF-1 gradient ( P \u2264 0.0391, n = 4-5). Similarly, RGS1, 13 and 16 overexpression suppressed SDF-1-induced Akt phosphorylation (n = 2), but none of them affected SDF-1-mediated actin polymerization (n = 3). In the NOD/SCID mouse xenotransplantation model, preliminary results showed that bone marrow homing was impaired in RGS1- (16.3% reduction), RGS13- (12.7% reduction) or RGS16-overexpressing CD34+ cells (33.7% reduction). Taken together, we provided the first evidence that expressions of R4 RGS proteins are regulated by the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in human CD34+ HSC. We also presented evidence that specific R4 RGS proteins (RGS1, 13 and 16) negatively regulate in vitro SDF-1-mediated responses and in vivo homing of CD34+ cells, suggesting that RGS proteins may serve as a feedback mechanism to regulate SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling. Strategies to inhibit RGS signaling could thus be a potential method for enhancing efficiency of HSC homing and long-term engraftment, which is particularly important in the setting of CB transplantation.
