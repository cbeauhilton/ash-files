    "abstract_text": "Although they produce high rate of molecular response second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors or imatinib cannot eradicate CML primitive progenitors. Interferon has been shown to modulate gene expression, inhibits leukemic cell growth and induces an immunomodulatory response. In vitro studies support the use of combination of IM plus interferon. We designed a phase III randomised multicenter open-label prospective trial comparing IM 400 mg/d (n=223) with 3 experimental arms: IM 600 mg/d (n=171), IM 400 mg/d combined to s/c Peg-IFN2a (90 \u00b5g/wk) (n=221) and IM 400 mg/d combined to s/c Ara-C, (20 mg/m 2 /d, d15-28 of 28-day cycles)(n=172). Pts were allocated at a 1.1.1.1 ratio, stratified by Sokal risk groups. Molecular assessments were centralised, blinded and calculated according to the international standardised ratio (IS) As of December 31 st 2010, date for closing accrual, 787 pts have been included. We first demonstrated that the addition of PegIFN increased the molecular responses. The planned molecular analysis after 1 year based on the outcome of 636 pts resulted in a highly significant superiority of MR4 (\u22640.01 % Bcr-Abl/Abl on IS) of the combination IM 400mg-PegIFN (Preudhomme et al. N Engl J Med, 2010). The protocol was also amended after the demonstration that a lower dose of PegIFN (45 \u00b5g/week) resulted in less toxicity and similar molecular responses as compared with 90 \u00b5g/week. Of interest, a 3-months BCR-ABL transcript level of \u226410% IS was associated with PFS (Accelerated phase, blast crisis, deaths) and time to progression (TTP) improvement overall. However, results which were observed with the addition of PegIFN or an increased dose of IM frontline do not confirm the relevance of the 10% BCR-ABL cut-off level as a strong surrogate marker for progression. After a median observation time of 60 months, 5-year overall survival (OS) was 94%, and 5-year PFS was 93%. Overall 70 pts died because of blastic (n=24) or accelerated phases (n = 1). Out of the 35 pts who progressed to AP and BC, 11 are alive. A blastic phase was recorded in 27 pts (myeloid 20, lymphoid 6, biphenotypic 1), of these 4 are alive (2 myeloid, 2 lymphoid). Main causes of deaths in CP (n = 46) were infections (IM 400 n=4,IM 600 n=0, IM PegIFN n=4, IM Ara-c n=0 ), vascular events (IM 400 n=1,IM 600 n=2,IM PegIFN n=1, IM Ara-c n=1) malignancies (IM 400 n=3, IM 600 n=2 ,IM PegIFN n=4, IM Ara-c n=7 ). In addition, the following causes of death were recorded: suicide (n=2), GVHD (n=2), miscellaneous (n=13). Cumulative incidence of progression, PFS and OS by arms are shown in the table: Table 1  .

The dose of 45\u00b5g/week is well tolerated and sufficient for achieving molecular responses and should be used in further trials. The risk of progression to blastic or accelerated phase, although currently non-significant, is lower with this combination. An update of outcomes will be presented.
