    "abstract_text": "Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a congenital disorder characterized by very short telomeres. Clinical presentation includes a diagnostic triad (lacey reticular pigmentation, nail dystrophy, and leukoplakia), aplastic anemia (the main cause of premature death), myelodysplastic syndrome/leukemia and solid tumors. Allogeneic HCT is the only curative option for the hematologic complications of DC but has been associated with a high risk of peri-transplant morbidity and early death. Only about fifty HCT for DC have been performed to-date, and the five year survival after related donor HCT has been about 75%, but only approximately 35% when an unrelated donor was used. To improve survival in DC patients by decreasing transplant mortality, we introduced a reduced intensity regimen including cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg), fludarabine (200 mg/kg), low dose total body irradiation (200 cGy), and (in patients 3 and 4) campath 1H (1 mg/kg). To decrease the risk of graft rejection, grafts were not T-cell depleted. We report outcomes in four consecutive patients, two adults and two children, all of whom engrafted with donor hematopoiesis:  Age (years) . Sex . Graft and HLA match . NC dose (\u00d710 8 /kg) . CD34 dose (\u00d710 8 /kg) . Follow-up (months) . Donor chimerism . 24 M URD dUCB 4/6, 4/6 0.55, 0.39 0.5, 0.43 1 (dead*) 83% 29 F REL PBSC 6/6 13.93 4.43 20 (alive) 100% 5 F URD BM 7/8 1.38 1.55 16 (alive) 100% 2 M URD BM 8/8 5.92 2.31 3 (alive) 100% Age (years) . Sex . Graft and HLA match . NC dose (\u00d710 8 /kg) . CD34 dose (\u00d710 8 /kg) . Follow-up (months) . Donor chimerism . 24 M URD dUCB 4/6, 4/6 0.55, 0.39 0.5, 0.43 1 (dead*) 83% 29 F REL PBSC 6/6 13.93 4.43 20 (alive) 100% 5 F URD BM 7/8 1.38 1.55 16 (alive) 100% 2 M URD BM 8/8 5.92 2.31 3 (alive) 100% View Large Legend: M, male; F, female; NC, nucleated cell; URD, unrelated donor; REL, related donor; BM, bone marrow; dUCB, double umbilical cord blood; PBSC, peripheral blood stem cells; *Patient had autologous recovery after the first dUCB and died of sepsis 1 month after the second dUCB; HLA matching is reported for antigen level HLA-A, B and allele level DRB1 for cord blood, and allele level typing for HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 for PBSC or BM. The most recent donor chimerism is reported. To decrease the risk of graft rejection and prevent graft versus host disease (GvHD) patients received cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. Patient 2 developed limited chronic GvHD and patient 4 developed grade III skin acute GvHD. Both were treated successfully with systemic and topical steroids. Our data suggest that this conditioning regimen results in a low rate of transplant related complications without compromising engraftment. Critically, early fatal pulmonary and vascular complications, common in post-transplant courses in DC patients, were not observed. This highlights the need to avoid drugs that are associated with pulmonary toxicity such as busulfan, and to limit radiation to the lung in patients with DC. This new less intensive conditioning regimen appears to result in a low rate of transplant related complications, and yet has adequate immunosuppressive activity to permit engraftment from alternative donors in DC patients.",
