In the past, AA was considered to be a fatal disease; however, current therapies, including bone marrow transplantation or immunosuppressive therapy (IST) with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CSA), are curative in the majority of patients. IST is effective at restoring hematopoietic stem cell production, but relapse and evolution to myelodysplastic syndromes remain clinical challenges. Additionally, there is no real consensus regarding optimal CSA levels, duration of CSA treatment, or the optimal use of growth factors and their relationship to the development of clonal disease. Objectives The primary objective was to review treatment management for severe AA in pediatric patients in order to elucidate treatment differences and review morbidity and mortality as they relate to treatment variation. Study Design/Methods A retrospective review of pediatric patients treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia for AA (both severe and moderate) over a 23 year period was performed. Results A total of 70 patients with AA were treated at our institution from 1985 to July 2008. Exclusions included: 6 patients who received some type of initial treatment at outside institutions, 4 patients who had missing records, and 2 patients who had a diagnosis of moderate AA. Thus, a total of 58 patient records were included in the analysis. Of the total patients reviewed, 60% were male and 40% were female. 34.5% of patients were African-American, and 57% were diagnosed in 2000 or later. The mean age at diagnosis was 9.5\u00b15.8 years. 52% fell into the category of very severe AA based on published diagnostic criteria, 45% had severe AA, and 2 patients (3%) had moderate AA. 15.5% of patients developed AA in the setting of acute hepatitis. More than half of the patients treated with IST had a complete response (CR). The average time to CR was 15\u00b115 months. Average duration of CSA treatment was 15\u00b113 months and 8.6\u00b110.7 months for growth factor. Two patients (3.5%) died, one from complications unrelated to AA and one from infectious complications post-BMT after initial IST failure. Average time to transfusion independence for all patients was 8\u00b111 months (with a range of 0-54 months). Not surprisingly, the time to transfusion independence was significantly associated with IST failure (p=0.010). Patients who failed treatment had an average time to transfusion independence of 17\u00b116 months as compared to those who were complete responders who had an average time to transfusion independence of 3\u00b13 months. Additionally, there was a significant association between IST failure and CSA levels (p=0.014). Patients who had nontherapeutic CSA levels overall had an increased rate of treatment failure. Of those patients who were nontherapeutic, 56% were noncompliant with CSA administration. There was no significant association between IST failure and bone marrow cellularity (p=0.251). PNH was diagnosed in 5% of patients; there were no patients with evidence of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Two of the 3 patients with PNH failed initial IST. Another 2 patients had evidence of a cytogenetic abnormality (16q deletion), but never progressed to MDS. (Note: averages presented as mean\u00b1SD) Conclusions/Methods With current IST regimens, AA is curative in the majority of pediatric patients. IST failure was associated with nonadherence to CSA treatment. For patients with confirmed clonal disease, it is possible that IST failure and the ultimate development of clonal disease are related.
