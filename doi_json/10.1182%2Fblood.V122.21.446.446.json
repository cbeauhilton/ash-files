    "abstract_text": "ADAMTS13, a plasma metalloprotease, cleaves von Willebrand factor (VWF) and inhibits arterial thrombosis and inflammatory response. Deficiency of plasma ADAMTS13, due hereditary mutations in ADAMTS13 gene or autoantibodies against ADAMTS13 protease, results in a potentially fatal syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Plasma infusion or exchange is the only effective therapy available to date. To develop novel therapeutics against TTP, we tested a hypothesis that recombinant ADAMTS13, expressed specifically in platelets, may offer systemic protection against arterial thrombosis and therefore provide therapeutic benefit for TTP. To test this hypothesis, we first generated transgenic mice (JAX B6SJL) carrying a human full-length ADAMTS13 gene under a murine platelet glycoprotein 1b (CD41) promoter. The transgenic mice were then bred with Adamts13 -/- (CAST/Ei) mice for >4 generations. By Western blotting and activity assay, we show that a full-length human ADAMTS13 protein (\u223c195 kDa) and its proteolytic activity toward a FRETS-hVWF73 peptide are detected in platelet lysate obtained from transgenic (rA13-Plt TG ) mice but not in Adamts13 -/- mice or wild-type mice. Little to no ADAMTS13 activity was detected in plasma in transgenic mice, suggesting the expressed human ADAMTS13 is stored inside platelets. ADAMTS13 was releasable upon stimulation with thrombin (1 U/ml), collagen (10 \u00b5g/ml), and AYPGKF (0.5 mM). More significantly, rA13-Plt TG mice had higher baseline platelet count than Adamts13 -/- mice, but exhibited a dramatically reduced rate of thrombus formation in mesenteric arterioles after oxidative injury with 10% ferric chloride as compared with Adamts13 -/- mice and wild-type mice. Finally, rA13-Plt TG mice were protected from Shigatoxin-2 (Stx-2) or murine recombinant VWF (mVWF)-induced \u201cTTP-like\u201d syndrome, as demonstrated by fewer rA13-Plt TG mice having thrombocytopenia (defined by a 40% drop in platelet count from the baseline after challenge with Stx-2 or mVWF), faster and more complete recovery of thrombocytopenia, and significantly higher survival rate than Adamts13 -/- mice. In summary, we have generated transgenic mice expressing human ADAMTS13 in platelets. Platelet ADAMTS13 is releasable upon stimulation by agonists and biologically functional in proteolytic cleavage of VWF in vitro. The platelet-derived ADAMTS13 offers systemic protection against arterial thrombosis after oxidative injury and provide a therapeutic benefit to murine models of TTP, resulting from hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency. We are now in the process testing the efficacy of this strategy as a novel therapeutic for acquired TTP with inhibitors. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
