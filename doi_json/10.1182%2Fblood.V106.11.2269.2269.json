    "abstract_text": "The AML1-CBF\u03b2 transcription factor complex is the most frequent target of specific chromosome translocations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The monocytic leukemia zinc finger (MOZ) gene, which encodes a MYST-type histone acetyltransferase (HAT), is also involved in leukemia-associated translocations such as t(8;16), t(8;22) and inv(8), which are associated with acute myeloid leukemia with M4/5 subtypes. We previously found that MOZ functions as a potent coactivator for AML1. To investigate roles of MOZ in normal hematopoiesis, we generated MOZ-deficient mice using gene-targeting method. MOZ homozygous mutant is embryonic lethal and it died between days 14 and 15 of gestation. In fetal liver of MOZ-deficient E14.5 embryos, the total cell numbers and the colony-forming cells (CFCs) in a methylcellulose medium were remarkably reduced when compared with wild-type littermates. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitors of both myeloid and lymphoid lineages were severely reduced in MOZ-deficient embryos. Especially, the levels of c-kit expression were strongly reduced in lineage-negative cells. Differentiation arrest of erythroid progenitors at a terminal stage and increase in the numbers of Mac-1 and Gr-1 positive cells suggest that MOZ also plays roles in cell differentiation of erythroid, monocytic and granulocytic lineages. In E12.5 MOZ deficient fetal liver cells, expression profile analysis revealed decreases in expressions of thrombopoietin receptor c-mpl, Wnt related ligand dkk2 and HoxA9 and increase in HoxA5 expression. To further determine roles of MOZ in HSCs functions and their progenitors differentiation ability, competitive reconstitution assays were performed. Ly5.2 + fetal liver cells from wild-type, heterozygous or homozygous mutant embryos together with Ly5.1 + competitor fetal liver cells were transplanted into \u03b3-irradiated Ly5.1 + /Ly5.2 + recipient mouse. Ly5.2 + wild-type cells were observed in recipient mice after transplantation. However, cells derived from MOZ homozygous mutant embryos were not detected in peripheral blood, bone marrow, spleen and thymus. Reduced population of cells derived from heterozygous mutant embryos were observed. These data suggest that MOZ is required for lymphoid and myeloid development and for self-renewal of HSCs.",
