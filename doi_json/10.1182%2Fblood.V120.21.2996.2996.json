    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2996 It is reported that both block of costimulator (ICOS) or its ligand signal pathway and transfusion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can reduce the severity of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Using a MHC-haploidentical murine model of acute GvHD, we investigated the effects of MSC -ICOS-EGFP , bone marrow derived MSCs transduced with ICOS-gene using an adenoviral vector, on acute GvHD. Lethally irradiated CB6F1 mice were transplanted with bone marrow cells and spleen cells from C57BL/6 mice, and injected with MSC -ICOS-EGFP , MSCs, ICOS-Ig fusion protein or the diluent (control), respectively. Survival in recipients of MSC -ICOS-EGFP was significantly higher than that in GVHD group (74.29\u00b17.39% vs 0, P=0.000, n=35), and also higher than in MSCs, ICOS-Ig, or MSCs+ICOS-Ig groups (74.29\u00b17.39% vs 42.86\u00b18.36% or 48.57\u00b18.45% or 50.43\u00b18.45%, P=0.0039 or 0.0323 or 0.0418, n=35). The lower mortality in recipients of MSC -ICOS-EGFP was related to lower incidence of acute GvHD. MSC -ICOS-EGFP can reduce the number of CD4 + T cells in the early stage of GvHD due to the increased apoptosis, and it can produce CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells meanwhile. The effect on GvHD in recipient of MSC -ICOS-EGFP was also associated with higher serum levels of IL-4, IL-10 and lower levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-12, IL-17A, as well as inducing expression of GATA-3, STAT6 transcription factors while inhibiting expression of T-bet, STAT4, ROR-rt in spleen. In vitro, the CD4 + T cells of donor were sharply inhibited by MSC -ICOS-EGFP and the B7h blockade. In MLRs we can also detect lower levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2and higher levels of IL-4, IL-10. These data indicate that MSC -ICOS-EGFP is a more prospective strategy for acute GvHD prevention, which had a synergism effect between MSCs and ICOS-Ig. The mechanisms of MSC -ICOS-EGFP on acute GvHD were closely associated with modulation of CD4 + T cells, CD4 + CD25 + Tregs, and regulation of the Th1/Th2/Th17 balance in the early stage of GvHD.
