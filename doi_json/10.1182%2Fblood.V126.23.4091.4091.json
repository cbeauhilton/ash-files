    "abstract_text": "Background. In primary myelofibrosis (PMF), mutations of JAK2 , CALR and MPL driver genes can be detected in about 60%, 20% and 5% of the patients (pts), respectively. Therefore, about 10% of the pts lack any of the 3 driver mutations and are operationally called \"triple negative\" (TN). TN pts present a higher risk of developing anemia and thrombocytopenia, suffer from reduced overall survival compared to other genotypes, particularly to CALR type1/type1-like mutations, and may be at higher risk of leukemic transformation ( Blood 2014; 124:1062; Leukemia 2014; 28:1472; Blood 2014;124:2465 ). Aims The aim of the study was to analyse the molecular landscape of TN PMF pts by genotyping a set of myeloproliferative-neoplasms associated genes whose mutated status was shown to be prognostically relevant in previous studies ( Leukemia 2013;27:1861 ; Blood 2014;123:2220; Leukemia 2014;28:1804;Leukemia 2014;28:1494). Methods. Diagnosis ofPMF was made according to WHO2008 criteria. All pts provided informed written consent. Previously published methods were used to screen mutations involving JAK2, MPL and CALR. A deep sequencing custom panel was designed to genotype the following genes: EZH2, ASXL1, IDH1/2 , SRSF2, TP53, TET2, RUNX1, CBL, NRAS, KRAS, DNMT3A, SF3B1, IKZF1, NFE2, SH2B3. Analysis was performed using the Ion torrent PGM platform. Comparisons of quantitative variables between groups were carried out by the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The prognostic value of the molecular variables with regard to OS was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression. Results. We analysed 28 TN PMF collected at the time of diagnosis. Median age was 66.7y, 57% were male. Median follow up was 2.1y (0.3-14.5). Overall, 8 patients (28.6%) progressed to AML. Death occurred in 20 pts (71.4%) after a median follow up of 2.3y (1.4-3.3y); progression to leukemia was the cause of death in 5 pts (25%). Overall, 22 pts (78.6%) presented at least one mutation in any of the 15 genes of the panel; 14 pts (50%) presented at least 2 mutations in different genes. The frequency of mutated genes was: SRSF2 39.3%, ASXL1 28.6%, EZH2 21.4%, NRAS 21.4%, TET2 10.7%, CBL 10.7%, IDH 3.6%, DNMT3A 3.6%, SH2B3 3.6%, U2AF1 3.6%. Twenty pts (71.4%) were classified as high molecular risk (HMR: ie, any mutated gene of ASXL1, EZH2, SRSF2, IDH1/2 ), a proportion significantly higher (P<0.01) than among JAK2 V617F (31.5%), CALR Type1/1-like (22.0%) and CALR Type2-type2-like (5.0%) ( Leukemia 2013; 27:1861 ). Mutated genes were grouped into 3 different pathways: epigenetic regulation ( ASXL1, EZH2, TET2, IDH ), splicing machinery ( SRSF2, U2AF1 ) and leukemic transformation ( NRAS, DNMT3A, SH2B3, CBL ). The most frequently mutated pathway was the epigenetic one with mutations in 14 pts (63.6%) of which 3 pts (21.4%) had 2 or more mutated genes of the pathway; 12 pts (54.5%) presented mutations in the splicing machinery and of these 8 pts (66.7%) had 2 or more mutated genes of the pathway; genes involved in leukemic transformation were mutated in 11 pts (50%) and 10 of 11 (90.9%) had 2 or more mutated genes. In three cases (13.6%) all 3 pathways were concurrently involved. Among the mutated genes, SRSF2 was associated with shorter survival [1.9y (1.6-2.2)] compared to pts with un-mutated SRSF2 [3.2y (0.9-5.4y)] (HR 2.3, 95%CI 0.9-6.4). SRSF2 mutations were also associated with shorter leukemia free survival (LFS): LFS not reached in un-mutated pts compared to 2.2y (1.8-2.7y) for mutated pts, with a HR=4.5 (95%CI 10.3-19.9). We also found that in pts with grade 1 bone marrow fibrosis the splicing and the leukemic pathway were more frequently mutated compared to grade 2-3 fibrosis (57% vs 28.5% and 50% vs 28.5% respectively). Conclusions. \"Triple-negative\" pts with PMF present high rate of mutations of MPN-associated genes, most of them are classified as \"high molecular risk\" and harbor >2 mutations. Mutated SRSF2 was particularly associated with shorter LFS. Such complex molecular landscape might help to explain the negative outcome of TN PMF pts.
