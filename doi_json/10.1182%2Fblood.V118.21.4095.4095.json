    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4095 Backgroud: The prognosis of patients with T-ALL/LL has been recently re-assessed, based on monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) levels and new insights in pathogenesis ( NOTCH1 pathway mutations). To date, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in first complete remission (CR) remains the standard option in patients identified with a high risk of relapse. In this context, patients relapsing after HSCT represent a very difficult challenge to get a second CR. Nelarabine, a pro-drug of Ara-G, has been associated with a high response rate in relapsing ALL (Go\u0308kbuget N et al., Blood 2011), but very few data are available on its efficacy and safety in the post-HSCT setting. Patients: Medical records of 11 T-ALL/LL patients who received nelarabine-based salvage therapy for a relapse after HSCT were retrospectively reviewed. These patients were treated with nelarabine alone (1,5g/m 2 /day (D) D1, D3, D5, every 28 days) (N=5) or nelarabine associated with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide (HyperC; N=6). Results: Ten patients had T-ALL and one had T-LL. Median age was 23 years (14\u201362) at time of diagnosis. Ten patients underwent HSCT in first CR (median time between diagnosis and HSCT: 141 days). HSCT conditioning regimen was myeloablative for 7 patients including Total Body Irradiation for 6 of them (reduced intensity conditioning for 4 patients). Source of stem cells was hematopoietic peripheral blood stem cells in 6 patients, bone marrow in 4 patients and unrelated cord blood in one patient. Four patients received a transplant from an HLA matched sibling donor and 7 from an unrelated donor (HLA-matched 10/10 in 3 patients). GVHD prophylaxis consisted in ciclosporine for all patients, either associated with methotrexate for 8 patients, mycophenolate for 2 patients or alone for one patient. Eight patients presented grade I-II acute GVHD (no patient had grade III-IV). Two patients developed chronic GVHD (1 extensive). Relapse occurred with a median duration of 199 days (119\u20132099). Six patients were still under immunosuppressive agents, because of slow tapering off or context of GVHD, which was stopped quickly. One patient presented a relapse in the context of cGVHD. Of the 11 patients treated with nelarabine-based salvage therapy, 81% achieved hematological CR within a median delay of 48 days. At one year, disease-free and overall survivals were 56% and 90%, respectively. Eight patients received additional nelarabine consolidation cycles (median, 4 cycles) and 2 CR patients received Donor Lymphocytes Infusion (1 complete molecular CR). One patient presented acute GVHD following nelarabine-based first cycle, requiring immunosuppressive treatment. Main toxicity was neurological (Grade 2 according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events), with 2 patients presenting sensitive neuropathy and cerebellar ataxia. Conclusion: In patients with T-ALL/LL relapsing after allogeneic HSCT, nelarabine-based salvage therapy was well tolerated with 2 neurological complications grade 2 and one acute GVHD. Moreover, this treatment was associated with a very high (81%) response rate with some patients experiencing prolonged remission. Post-HSCT nelarabine maintenance might thus be a valuable option to investigate in high-risk patients, possibly driven by MRD detection. Assessing immune responses in this particular setting could also be of particular interest. Disclosures: Peffault de Latour: Alexion: Consultancy, Research Funding.",
