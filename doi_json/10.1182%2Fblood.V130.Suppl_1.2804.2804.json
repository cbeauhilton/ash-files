    "abstract_text": "NK/T cell lymphoma (NKTCL) patients are frequently misdiagnosed as chronic nasosinusitis, which delays therapy and leads to poor prognosis. Our study aims to explore serum biomarkers to differentiate NKTCL patients from healthy individuals. Pretreatment and posttreatment serum samples from 16 newly-diagnosed NKTCL patients were collected. Serum samples from 16 matched healthy individuals were also collected. Comparative proteomic approach were utilized to identify the differentially expressed proteins. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to validate the candidate biomarkers. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was employed to examine their sensitivity and specificity. Compared with healthy controls,109 upregulated and 82 downregulated proteins were identified in pretreatment serums of NKTCL patients. Among the differentially expressed proteins, PTX3 and S100A9 were selected as candidate biomarkers for further validation. ELISA assay showed that NKTCL patients present higher serum levels of PTX3 (p0.05). In conclusion, serum PTX3 in combination with S100A9 could serve as potential biomarkers for NKTCL diagnosis and treatment response evaluation. Further confirmation of PTX3 and S100A9 in a larger cohort of patients will promote their clinical use. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
