    "article_date": "November 16, 2008",
    "session_type": "Disordered Gene Expression in Hematologic Malignancy, Including Disordered Epigenetic Regulation",
    "abstract_text": "In previously published genome-wide copy number analysis of leukemic samples from 242 pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, we reported that mutations in genes regulating B lymphoid development are the most common lesion in B-progenitor ALL, and these include PAX5 , IKZF1 , and EBF1 . Mono-allelic deletion of EBF1 was observed in 8/200 B-progenitor leukemia samples, including a BCR-ABL1 ALL. EBF1 encodes a transcription factor that is required for the development of B cells, and with E2A regulates the expression of B-lineage specific genes. Mice null for Ebf1 arrest B cell development at the pro-B cell stage, whereas Ebf1 +/ \u2212 mice have a 50% reduction in the number of immature and mature B cells but a normal number of pro-B cells. Importantly, neither haploinsufficiency nor the complete loss of Ebf1 results in the development of leukemia in mice. To examine the role of genetic alterations targeting B-lymphoid differentiation in the pathogenesis in BCR-ABL1 ALL, we transduced Ebf1 +/+ and Ebf1 +/\u2212 bone marrow cells with MSCV-GFP-IRES-p185 BCR-ABL1 retrovirus and transplanted the resultant cells into lethally irradiated wild-type C57BL6 recipient mice. Mice transplanted with BCR-ABL1 Ebf1 +/ \u2212 cells developed B lineage ALLs at a shorter latency than observed with BCR-ABL1 Ebf1 +/+ cells (median overall survival of 17 days in Ebf1 +/\u2212 vs 42 days in Ebf1 +/+ , P<0.0001). All leukemias had a B220 + Cd19 + Bp1 + pre-B cell immunophenotype; however, the leukemias that developed from the Ebf1 +/\u2212 cells aberrantly expressed high levels of the stem cell marker Sca1 (mean fluorescence level for Sca1 of 69.6 in Ebf1 +/ \u2212 (n=22) vs 16.8 in Ebf1 +/+ (n=14), p<0.0001). To begin to understand how a decrease in the copy number of Ebf1 may contribute to leukemogenesis, we examined early B cell development in bone marrow (BM) cells from two week-old C57BL6 Ebf1 +/\u2212 and Ebf1 +/+ mice. Our analysis confirmed previous reports indicating a 2-fold reduction of B220 + CD43 \u2212 B cells in Ebf1 +/ \u2212 compared to Ebf1 +/+ mice. Interestingly, however, we also detected an approximately 6-fold increase in a transitional population of B220 lo IL-7R + cKit lo Pre-pro B cells that also expressed Sca1 (2194 mean number of Ebf1 +/ \u2212 cells per 100,000 BM cells (n=10) vs 372 mean number of Ebf1 +/+ cells per 100,000 BM cells (n=8), p<0.0001), an observation that raises the possibility that Ebf1 haploinsufficiency expands the pool of cells that are susceptible to transformation by BCR-ABL expression. It will be important to examine whether the accelerated tumorigenesis resulting from Ebf1 haploinsufficiency is a consequence of a subtle shift in differentiation, or some alternative mechanism of oncogenic cooperativity. Studies are underway to directly assess the role of B220 lo IL-7R + cKit lo Sca1 + cells in BCR-ABL1 driven ALL.",
