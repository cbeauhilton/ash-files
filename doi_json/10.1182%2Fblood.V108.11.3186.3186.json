    "abstract_text": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic syndrome characterized by development of progressive bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition. The difficulty in harvesting FA HSC and their fragility during subsequent in vitro manipulations has proven a confounding factor in attempted gene therapy of this disease. Mobilization of HSC/P in FA patients is poor (Croop et al . Blood, 2001) probably due to HSC deficiency. We have previously shown that the genetic deletion of the Rac GTPases 1 and 2 results in an increase in circulating hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors (HSC/P) (Gu et al . Science 2003). In addition, administration of a single dose of a small molecule inhibitor of Rac GTPases, NSC23766 , results in a transient mobilization of engraftable stem cells (Cancelas et al . Nat. Med., 2005). Here, we analyzed the role of NSC23766 in mobilizing HSC/P in FA A ( Fanca \u2212 / \u2212) mice (Cheng et al ., Hum. Mol. Genet., 2000; kindly provided by M. Grompe, OHSU). First, we validated that this murine model of FA demonstrated a stem cell phenotype by a competitive repopulation assay of BM HSC. We found that Fanca \u2212 / \u2212 HSC contribute decreased chimerism in short-term engraftment (52.6 \u00b1 2.6% donor engraftment) compared to wild-type (WT) controls (63.8 \u00b1 1.0%, respectively, p < 0.005). BM and spleen homing of Fanca \u2212/ \u2212 HSC/P at sixteen-hours post infusion was not impaired (7.0% in BM and 6.1% in spleen) compared to WT mice (7.8% in BM and 5.4% in spleen) and there was no difference in expression of CXCR4, a 4 -integrin, a 5 -integrin and L-selectin between Lin \u2212 /c-kit + /Sca-1 + BMC and mobilized PBC derived from Fanca \u2212 / \u2212 and WT mice, also supporting an intrinsic HSC defect. We then analyzed the ability of NSC23766 , alone or in combination with G-CSF, to mobilize HSC. We observed that Fanca \u2212 / \u2212 mice also show an impaired mobilization response to G-CSF administration (200 mcg/Kg/day for five days), which can be partially rescued by administering a single dose of NSC23766 , 6 hours before peripheral blood harvest (Table1). We additionally demonstrated the impaired engraftment of in vitro manipulated Fanca \u2212/ \u2212 BMC in a competitive transplant assay. This engraftment defect could be completely ameliorated by treatment with Diprotin A (5.9\u00b12.0% donor engraftment untreated vs. 12.0\u00b14.4% treated; p value = 0.01). Diprotin A is an inhibitor of CD26 peptidase which has been shown to cleave SDF1alpha/CXCL12. The combined use of G-CSF and NSC23766 may constitute a future novel approach to induce mobilization of Fanconi anemia HSC and, when coupled with Diprotin A treatment, could act to enhance the engraftment of cells undergoing genetic correction.
