    "abstract_text": "Background : LBCLs are prevalent and aggressive subtypes of NHL, with limited treatment options and historically poor outcomes in the third- or later-line setting. Liso-cel is an autologous, CD19-directed, defined composition, 4-1BB CAR T cell product administered at equal target doses of CD8 + and CD4 + CAR + T cells. TRANSCEND NHL 001 (NCT02631044) is a seamless design, pivotal, phase 1 study evaluating liso-cel in patients (pts) with R/R LBCLs (Abramson et al. Lancet 2020). We present 2-year follow-up data from the LBCL cohort. Methods: Pts \u2265 18 years of age with R/R DLBCL not otherwise specified (NOS, including de novo and transformed from any indolent lymphoma), high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL) with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), or follicular lymphoma grade 3B (FL3B) after \u2265 2 lines of therapy and with ECOG PS 0-2 were eligible. Pts with grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, mild to moderate organ dysfunction, and secondary CNS lymphoma were allowed. Bridging therapy was allowed at clinician discretion but reconfirmation of PET-positive disease was required before lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Primary endpoints were treatment-emergent AEs (TEAE) and ORR. Key secondary endpoints were CR rate, duration of response (DOR), PFS, and OS. TEAEs, including investigator-identified neurological events (NE) related to liso-cel, were graded using NCI CTCAE v4.03; cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was graded per Lee 2014 criteria in the liso-cel-treated set (all pts who received \u2265 1 dose of liso-cel). ORR was assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) per Lugano 2014 criteria in the efficacy-evaluable set (all pts with confirmed PET-positive disease who received \u2265 1 dose of liso-cel). Pts were followed for 2 years after the last dose of liso-cel and were then asked to enroll in a separate long-term follow-up study for up to 15 years (NCT03435796). Results: A total of 345 pts underwent leukapheresis. In the liso-cel-treated set (N = 270), median age was 63 years (range, 18-86); 41% of pts were \u2265 65 years of age. Histologies included DLBCL NOS (de novo, 51%; transformed from indolent lymphoma, 29%), HGBCL (13%), PMBCL (6%), and FL3B (1%). Seven pts (3%) had secondary CNS lymphoma. Pts received a median of 3 prior lines of systemic therapy (range, 1-8) and 33% had prior autologous HSCT (prior allogeneic HSCT, 3%). Of all pts, 67% were chemotherapy refractory, 45% had never achieved CR, and 59% received bridging therapy. As of the Jan 4, 2021 data cut, study is ongoing; 268 pts had \u2265 24 months (mo) of follow-up, died, or withdrew from the study. Responses per IRC (ORR, 73%; CR rate, 53%) in the efficacy-evaluable set (N = 257) were durable with a median (95% CI) DOR of 23.1 mo (8.6-not reached), median PFS of 6.8 mo (3.3-12.7), and median OS of 27.3 mo (16.2-45.6) ( Table ). At 24 mo, the probabilities (95% CI) of continued response, PFS, and OS were 49.5% (41.4%-57.0%), 40.6% (34.0%-47.2%), and 50.5% (44.1%-56.5%), respectively. During the 90-day treatment-emergent (TE) reporting period, 79% of pts in the liso-cel-treated set (N = 270) had grade \u2265 3 TEAEs; 45% had serious TEAEs. CRS and NE of any grade occurred in 42% and 30% of pts, respectively (grade 3-4 CRS, 2%; grade 3-4 NE, 10%). Median (range) time to onset of CRS and NE was 5 (1-14) and 9 (1-66) days, respectively. Grade \u2265 3 infections and laboratory-based prolonged cytopenia at Day 29 occurred in 12% and 37% of pts, respectively. In the post-TE (Day 91 to end of study) reporting period, which included 17 pts who received liso-cel re-treatment, 23% of pts in the liso-cel-treated set (N = 249) had grade \u2265 3 AEs and 17% had serious AEs. The most common grade \u2265 3 AEs in the post-TE period were neutropenia (7%), anemia (6%), thrombocytopenia (4%), and febrile neutropenia (4%). Grade \u2265 3 infections occurred in 5% of pts. In the post-TE period, 100 pts (37% of all pts) died, mostly due to disease progression (86% of all post-TE deaths; 32% of all pts). CAR T cells were present in peripheral blood for up to 4 years. Conclusions: Liso-cel demonstrated durable remissions with estimated 2-year DOR and PFS rates of 49.5% and 40.6%, respectively, and a favorable safety profile in the extended follow-up analysis of this large CAR T cell study in R/R LBCLs. Most CAR T cell-associated AEs occurred within the initial 90-day TE reporting period. No new safety signals were observed during long-term follow-up.
