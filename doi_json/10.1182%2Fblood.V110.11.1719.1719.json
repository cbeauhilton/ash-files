    "abstract_text": "There is considerable interest in the elucidation of the mechanism that governs the linkage of elongated spectrin molecules to the erythrocyte plasma membrane. The mechanism by which the \u201chead\u201d region of the spectrin dimer, which participates in tetramer formation, binds to the membrane via ankyrin and band 3 has been reasonably well characterized. However, the mechanism by which the tail end of the spectrin dimer is anchored to the plasma membrane is not completely understood. Dematin and adducin are actin binding proteins located at the spectrin-actin junctions or \u201cjunctional complex\u201d in the erythrocyte membrane. Individual suppression of their function in mice by the gene deletion exerts a modest effect on erythrocyte shape and membrane stability. In contrast, the combined deletion of dematin and adducin genes results in severe defects of erythrocyte shape, membrane instability, and hemolysis. Based on these findings, we proposed a model whereby dematin and adducin could function as a molecular bridge linking the junctional complex to the plasma membrane. Using a combination of cell surface labeling, immunoprecipitation, and vesicle proteomics, we have identified glucose transporter-1 as the receptor for dematin and adducin in the human erythrocyte membrane. This finding is the first description of a transmembrane protein that binds to dematin and adducin, thus providing a rationale for the attachment of the cytoskeletal junctional complex to the lipid bilayer via glucose transporter-1. Since homologues of dematin, adducin, and glucose transporter-1 exist in many non-erythroid cells, we propose that a conserved mechanism may exist that couples sugar and other related transporters to the actin cytoskeleton.",
