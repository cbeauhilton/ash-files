    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3135 Peripheral T cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS) is heterogenous groups of aggressive T-cell lymphoma and treatment outcome is dismal. Lymphopenia is an independent prognostic factor for survival for B-cell lymphoma . The ALC at diagnosis on survival in T-cell lymphoma has not been studied. Thus, we studied the role of ALC at diagnosis on clinical outcome in patients with PTCL, NOS. Between 2001 and 2009, 32 patients with PTCL, NOS reviewed for the study. Median patient age was 57 (range 34\u201378) years. Median ALC at the time of diagnosis was 1.54 (range 0.41\u201312.64\u00d710 9 /L). Patients were divided two groups according to ALC count 1.0 \u00d710 9 /L. Ten patients (31%) had lower ALC at diagnosis. Median follow up duration was 299 days (range 11\u20132164 days). Overall response rate was 61.5% (16 of 26 patients) and complete response (CR) rate was 42% (11 of 26 patients). Only two patients reached CR in low ALC group.There was no significant difference in overall response rate because of small number of patients. Superior overall survival was observed with an ALC 1.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L (N = 22) versus an ALC < 1.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L (N=10) (median OS: not reached vs 242 days, OS rates at 5 years, 57% vs 0%, p =0.016, respectively). Multivariate analysis demonstrated ALC to be an independent prognostic indicator for OS (Hazard Ratio 3.5, 95% confidence intervals 1.2\u201310.2; p<0.019) when compared to the International prognostic index (IPI) and Prognostic Index for PTCLU (PIT). This study suggested that low ALC is an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with PTCL, NOS. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
