    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Normal bm may contain reticulin, which is of unknown clinical relevance. An analysis of romiplostim ITP trials as of 2011 showed 17 reticulin cases and one collagen case; however, biopsies were not performed systematically. Reported here are final results from a prospective 3-year (y) study evaluating bm biopsies for reticulin and collagen before and after treatment with romiplostim in adult ITP pts. Methods: Eligible ITP pts had platelets <50x10 9 /L, received \u22651 prior ITP therapy, and had no collagen in baseline bm biopsies (before romiplostim). Biopsies were scheduled after 1 (Cohort 1), 2 (Cohort 2), or 3 (Cohort 3) y of romiplostim, dosed to maintain platelets at 50\u2013200x10 9 /L; all cohorts could receive 3 y of romiplostim. Biopsies were also performed if pts discontinued early or failed to achieve/maintain a response to romiplostim (platelets \u226420x10 9 /L for 4 consecutive weeks at the max dose of 10 \u00b5g/kg). Reticulin and collagen were evaluated using the modified Bauermeister scale (0 no reticulin; 1 occasional fine fibers/foci of fine fiber network; 2 fine fiber network; 3 diffuse fiber network, scattered coarse fibers; 4 diffuse coarse fiber network, areas of collagenization). Collagen was detected by trichrome staining and reticulin by silver staining. Two hematopathologists at a central laboratory read all the samples; an independent panel reviewed grading discrepancies. Results: All pts received romiplostim and had evaluable baseline bm biopsies. Of the 50 pts in Cohort 1 [54% female, mean age 55.5 y, range 20\u201386 y, mean (SD) dose 4.0 (2.8) \u00b5g/kg], 39 had post-baseline bm biopsies (Table). No pts with evaluable results developed collagen or had an increase \u22652 grades from baseline in reticulin. Of the 50 pts in Cohort 2 [76% female, mean age 48.6 y, range 19\u201383 y, mean (SD) dose 4.3 (3.1) \u00b5g/kg], 40 had post-baseline bm biopsies. There was no evidence of collagen; 2 pts had a 2-grade increase in reticulin. Of the 69 pts in Cohort 3 [71% female, mean age 46.6 y, range 18-81 y, mean (SD) dose 4.1 (2.9) \u00b5g/kg], 58 had post-baseline bm biopsies; 7 pts had a 2-grade increase in modified Bauermeister score, with 2 of the 7 showing collagen. Of those 2, 1 had no evidence of collagen on follow-up biopsy 12 weeks later; the other refused a follow-up biopsy. The safety profile was similar to that in past trials. In Cohort 1, 4 pts died; causes were fungal sepsis in a pt with longstanding corticosteroid use, cerebral hemorrhage, pulmonary hemorrhage in a pt with pulmonary thrombosis treated with acenocoumarol, and subdural hematoma that occurred after the pt fell and sustained a head injury. In Cohort 2, 2 pts died; causes were acute renal failure in a pt with a history of chronic renal insufficiency and suicide. In Cohort 3, 1 pt died of multiple thromboses of microcirculation and failure of the heart, kidneys, and lungs. No deaths were attributed to romiplostim. One pt in Cohort 3 tested positive for neutralizing antibodies (Ab) to romiplostim at Week 30 through the Year 1 visit, but was Ab negative on a subsequent test; the last romiplostim dose was at Week 36, but the pt maintained platelet response throughout. Summary/Conclusion: An increase in modified Bauermeister score by \u22652 grades occurred in 9 of 131 pts (6.9%) treated with romiplostim; 7 had increased reticulin only and 2 also had collagen. The low incidence of both collagen and increased reticulin is consistent with results of past romiplostim studies. Table Biopsy Results Table  . Cohort 1 N = 50 . Cohort 2 N = 50 . Cohort 3 N = 69 .
