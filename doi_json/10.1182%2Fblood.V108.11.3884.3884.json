    "abstract_text": "Many methods are utilized to destroy mononuclear cells (primarily lymphocytes) either for neoplasm or immunosuppression. Neither radiation nor chemotherapy are truly selective or completely successful. The concept of \u201cDouble-Dye\u201d treatment of blood for transfusion has been developed in order to inactivate parasites, bacteria and viruses ( J Thromb Haemost  2003 ; 1 Supplement 1 July: P1114 ). In recent studies, it has been observed that this same \u201cDouble-Dye\u201d concept presents the possibility of very selectively eliminating lymphocytes (mononuclear cells) without affecting neutrophils in whole blood. To demonstrate the selectivity of dyes for lymphocytic/mononuclear cell types, two sets of experiments were performed. In the first, 0.3% (w/v) of the \u201cDouble Dye\u2019 solution was added to several normal citrated whole blood samples to assess the effect on normal cells, compared to an untreated control. At 24hours post treatment, the lymphocyte count in the treated sample had dropped more than 80%, while little effect on neutrophils was noted. The control counts showed little change for either lymphocytes or neutrophils. Table 1. Lymphocyte reduction by 0.3%(w/v) Double-dye solution (units: cells/mm3).  0hr . Control . 0.3% Dye .

The combination of dyes showed the most potent activity against the lymphocytic lines, while the control was virtually unaffected.

Studies investigating the in-vivo efficacy of these novel immunosuppressive and chemotherapeutic methods are currently underway.",
