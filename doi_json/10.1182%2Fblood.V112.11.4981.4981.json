    "abstract_text": "Background . Recently, gene expression profiling (GEP) indicated histone-deacetylases (HDAC) as potential therapeutic targets in peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) not otherwise specified (NOS), the commonest PTCL type. Consistently, phase II trials demonstrated the efficacy of some HDAC inhibitors (HDACi), including SAHA, which was approved for cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) treatment. Aims and methods . We investigated the anti-tumour effects of ITF2357 (Italfarmaco, Italy), a novel hydroxamic acid HDACi, on PTCL primarily-cultured cells and cell lines (HH and FEDP), and in a xenografted mouse-model of CTCL. Cultured cells were incubated with different dosages of ITF2357 and SAHA (ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 mM). Cell viability, assessed by trypan-blue exclusion assay, cell-cycle progression, assessed by bromodeossiuridine assay, and apoptotic rate, determined by flow-cytometry analysis of annexin-V binding populations were determined at 48, 72 and 120 hours. Nude mice, injected with HH cells, received ITF2357 (10\u201320mg/Kg, per os) for 14 days. Micro-PET scan was adopted for disease measurement and treatment response evaluation. Finally, GEP of cell lines exposed to ITF2357 and SAHA were generated to elucidate their mechanisms of action. Results . Cell viability of HH cells treated with ITF2357 ranged from 50% (0.5 mM, at 48 h), to <10% (0.5\u20132.5 mM, at 72\u2013120 h), in comparison to untreated cells. Differently, cell viability of HH cells treated with SAHA ranged from 80% (0.5 mM, at 48\u2013120 h) to 25% (2.5 mM at 48 h). Analogue effects were documented in FEDP and primarilycultured PTCL cells. Conversely, viability of normal T-lymphocyte was not significantly affected. Interestingly, exposure to ITF2357 was associated to G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. Finally, ITF2357 determined significant reduction of tumoral masses and survival benefit in a xenografted mice-model inoculated with HH cells. Conclusion . Taken together, these data demonstrate that ITF2357 is effective against PTCLs ex vivo and in vivo , by nominating it for clinical evaluation in this setting.",
