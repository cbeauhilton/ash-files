    "abstract_text": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) is a critical cytokine in systemic inflammation and a potent inducer of apoptotic cell death. Type 1 cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of aplastic anemia (AA) and other bone marrow (BM) failure syndromes. Overproduction of interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and TNF-\u03b1 from activated T cells or bone marrow cells has been proposed as a mechanism of BM failure. We hypothesized that inhibiting the production of TNF-\u03b1 or blockade of the TNF-\u03b1 signaling pathway would attenuate hematopoietic cell destruction in murine models of immune BM failure. Therefore, we tested the role of TNF-\u03b1 in several mouse models of human AA, using C57BL/6 (B6) mice carrying germline deletions of TNF-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1 -/- ) or its receptors including TNF-\u03b1 receptor superfamily member 1a (TNF-rsf1a -/- ), TNF-rsf1b -/- , and TNF-rsf1a -/- 1b -/- as donors or recipients, respectively. Lymph node (LN) cells from both TNF-\u03b1 -/- and TNF-\u03b1 receptor knock out mice induced fatal BM failure with efficacy similar to LN cells from wild-type B6 donors when infused into CByB6F1 recipients that had received 5 Gy of total body irradiation (TBI), indicating that expression of TNF-\u03b1 or TNF-\u03b1 receptors on effector cells did not affect the development of BM failure. However, TNF-\u03b1 -/- mice as recipients unexpectedly showed resistance to immune-mediated BM failure. Infusion of 5 million LN cells from MHC-mismatched FVB donors to 6.5 Gy TBI pre-conditioned TNF-\u03b1 -/- recipients did not induce AA: the animals had normal or increased levels of WBC, RBC, platelets, and total BM cells relative to TBI-only TNF-\u03b1 -/- mice; control wild-type B6 recipient mice developed severe pancytopenia and BM failure after LN infusion at 10 days (Fig. 1A&B). This result suggests that TNF-\u03b1 production in the recipients had a role in immune attack by effector cells. When residual BM cells were cultured in vitro in cytokine-supplemented methylcellulose media, cells from wild-type BM failure mice, but not from TNF-\u03b1 -/- recipient mice, showed a significant reduction in colony forming units relative to their TBI controls. By flow cytometry, Fas + cells and Annexin V-binding cells were increased in BM of wild-type marrow failure mice relative to wild-type TBI controls, but no increase in Fas + cells and Annexin V-binding cells was observed in TNF-\u03b1 -/- mice that had received LN infusion. In parallel experiments, injection of FVB LN cells into sub-lethally-irradiated TNF-rsf1a -/- , TNF-rsf1b -/- , or TNF-rsf1a -/- 1b -/- mice resulted in BM failure with declines in WBC and platelets as observed in wild-type B6 mice after FVB LN infusion. Plasma levels of both IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 were markedly increased in all the wild-type B6 and TNF-\u03b1 receptor knock out mice that developed BM failure, but not in TNF-\u03b1 -/- recipient mice. These data suggest that depletion of TNF-\u03b1 receptors could not attenuate immune-mediated BM destruction and that TNF-\u03b1 did not exert its destructive effect on hematopooetic targets through the TNF-\u03b1/TNF-rsf1a and 1b pathways. We hypothesized that TNF-\u03b1 might modulate T cell IFN-\u03b3 production to affect immune-mediated BM destruction. TNF-\u03b1 is mainly produced by activated macrophages, while IFN-\u03b3 is mainly secreted by activated T cells. Blockade of either IFN-\u03b3 in effector cells or IFN-\u03b3 receptor in target cells ameliorates the development of BM failure (Chen J, Blood.2015;126:2621). To test this hypothesis, we first depleted macrophages from CByB6F1 recipient mice with liposomal clodronate before BM failure induction with TBI and B6 LN cell injection. Indeed, removal of macrophages attenuated BM destruction relative to BM failure mice pre-injected with PBS-loaded liposomes without macrophage depletion (Figure 1C). When we injected recombinant TNF-\u03b1 daily i.v. for 1 week into TNF-\u03b1 -/- recipients following TBI and FVB LN cell infusion, TNF-\u03b1-injected mice had decreased BM cellularity relative to mice that received TBI and LN infusion without TNF-\u03b1 (Figure 1D). Remarkably, TNF-\u03b1 injection increased intracellular IFN-\u03b3 expression in BM T cells as determined by flow cytometry, indicating that TNF-\u03b1 was capable of stimulating T cells to secrete IFN-\u03b3. In summary, our study reveals a critical role of TNF-\u03b1 in target cells but not in effector cells, in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated BM failure by cell-cell \"crosstalk\" modulation of IFN-\u03b3 secretion.
