    "abstract_text": "Abstract 808 Background: Bone disease is one of the most debilitating complications in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). The molecular mechanisms by which MM triggers bone disease are not fully understood. We have previously demonstrated that Dkk1 is highly expressed in primary MM plasma cells, and associated with bone disease in MM patients by inhibiting Wnt signaling-promoted mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and osteoprotegerin production in osteoblast cells. We have also reported that increase in Wnt signaling in the bone marrow microenvironment by overexpression of Wnt3a in myeloma cells or administration of rWnt3a, or indirectly increasing Wnt signaling by administration of anti-Dkk1 neutralizing antibody also decreased in osteoclast numbers. However, Dkk1 is less frequently expressed in MM cell lines that are derived mostly from late stage of MM; and injection of these MM cell lines into human fetal bone also is able to induce bone lesion in MM animal model. These results indicate that additional factors may be involved in induction of the bone disease at the stage of the disease. The members of the sFRPs family of secreted proteins (including sFRP-1, -2, -3 and -4) directly bind to Wnts, thereby preventing Wnts from binding to the cellular Wnt receptor complex. It has also been reported that sFRP-1 and -2 augment canonical Wnt3a activated signaling in fibroblast. MM cells from pateints with advanced bone lesions express sFRP2 mRNA. Like sFRP2, sFRP3 mRNA is highly expressed in MM plasma cells, but it's function in MM bone disease remains unknown. We sought to investigate the role of sFRP3 in MM-triggered bone lesions using the osteoblast (OB) cell lines CH3T1/2 and C2C12, and serum from MM pateints those MM cells expressed high level of sFRP3. Methods/Results: RT-PCR analysis showed that sFRP3 is expressed in primary MM plasma cells and certain MM cell lines. Recombinant sFRP3 protein did not inhibit, but synergized with Wnt3a to increase beta-catenin protein, while Dkk1 significantly inhibited this process. Similarly, sFRP3 treatment of OB cells increase Wnt-3a-induced TCF transcript activity in OB cells transfected with TOPflash luciferase report constructs. sFRP3 also increased MSC differentiation, as evidenced by increase in alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) and increased in mineralization by Alizarin red staining. sFRP3 treatment also increases OPG mRNA and protein production in these cells. Similar to sFRP3, sFRP1 and sFRP2 synergistically acted with Wnt3a to induce MSC differentiation and OPG expression in osteoblasts, while Dkk1 significantly inhibited these processes. To confirm the synergistic effects of sFRPs with canonical Wnt signaling on MSC differentiation, we employed R-podin1, a well-known agonist of canonical Wnt signaling. Treatments of MSC cells with R-podin1 led to increase in beta-catenin protein and TCF transcriptional activity and in ALP activity, and increase in OPG mRNA and protein. Pretreatment of the cells with sFRP2 and sFPP3 proteins further enhanced the function of R-podin1. In contrast, Dkk1 protein showed negative effect on R-Spodin1 functions, indicating that sFRP2 and sFRP3 synergized with R-Spodin1 to induce activation of canonical Wnt signaling and subsequent MSC differentiation and OPG production. Conclusion: Taken together, these data suggest that sFRP2 and sFRP3 augment canonical Wnt signaling to induce MSC differentiation and indirectly inhibit osteoclastogenesis by regulating OPG in MSC cells. These results also indicate that Dkk1 may be most important in MM-induced bone disease. Disclosures: Barlogie: Celgene, Genzyme, Novartis, Millennium: Consultancy, Honoraria, Patents & Royalties.
