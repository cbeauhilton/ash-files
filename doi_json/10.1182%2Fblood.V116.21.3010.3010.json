Of available model systems, xenografts in immunodeficient mice reproduce the clinical situation advantageously. Here, the engraftment capacity of MM patient-derived bone marrow cells implanted into NOD/SCID-IL2-receptor-gamma-chain -/- (NSG) mice was meticulously investigated. Material and Methods: Bone marrow cells from 7 MM patients were injected intratibialy into NSG mice (n=5/patient). As controls, 5 mice received healthy donor bone marrow and 5 mice were mock-injected. Tumor growth was monitored via a) daily MM-symptom acquisition, such as hind limb paresis, apathy and consistent foot dragging, b) FACS (human HLA-A,B,C; CD138; CD45; CD38) and c) fluorescence-based in vivo imaging (FI, Kodak FX, Alexa750 labeled anti-human CD138, CD38, CD45 and HLA-ABC) in bone marrow, peripheral blood, spleen and lymph node sites of the respective animals. Results: There were significant differences in engraftment capacity, persistence of human cells and expression of selected markers between bone marrow of MM patients and healthy donors: 1.) infiltration of the spleen and lymph nodes was exclusively detected in NSG-mice bearing patient-derived MM cells, whereas cells of healthy donors were - if detected - exclusively found within the murine bone marrow; 2.) mean FI-areas in the bone marrow of MM-patient-derived injected mice were significantly increased as compared to mice bearing bone marrow cells of healthy donors (p=0.006); 3.) patient-derived MM cells expressed CD138, CD38 and HLA-ABC. In contrast, bone marrow cells of healthy donors expressed exclusively CD45 and CD138. The CD138 cell population determined by FACS in patients' bone marrow cells (before NSG-injection) decreased from a median of 11.3% to 0.8% 56 days after implantation (in NSG mice), either due to preferably CD138-negative plasma cell engraftment or the CD138 loss within the murine environment as previously described. Fifty-six days after implantation, patient-derived MM cells could be detected in all animals via FACS-analysis. Follow-up analyses by FI confirmed, that bone marrow engraftment was prominent and observed in all (35/35) NSG mice, albeit also in others organs. Patient-derived MM cells within the bone marrow could be detected in parallel via FACS- and FI-analyses in 10 NSG mice and within the peripheral blood in 12 NSG mice (total of 35 mice being examined). Maximal bone marrow-, peripheral blood- and spleen-engraftment numbers in NSG mice were as high as 4%, 25% and 52%, respectively, suggesting that in peripheral blood- and spleen-sites, MM-cell engraftment could even surmount that of bone marrow-sites. Spleen and other organ involvement observed in our xenografts have been confirmed in previous murine MM-models (Murillo et al. Clin Cancer Res, 2008), postulating that similarly to spleen-colony-forming-cells in hematopoiesis, spleen and other sites serve as fertile tumor engraftment locations.Differences in engraftment capacity and expression pattern between respective patient-derived MM specimen were evident, but did not strikingly correlate with MM-patients' characteristics, such as MM-subtypes, disease stage or expression pattern of the primary material; this observation also well correlating with previous reports (e.g. (Pilarski et al. Blood, 2000). Conclusions: Murine MM-models have shown to be exceedingly challenging in their ability to induce valid and trustworthy MM-patient-derived cell engraftment; here our NSG model suggest to harbor MM-cells. Our data demonstrates that intratibially-injected NSG mice mimic the clinical MM disease with respect to the disseminated nature of the disease and the indispensable engraftment of clonogenic plasma cells into the bone marrow. Collection of whole-body FI data proved to be a time- and animal-saving analysis that allows to closely monitor MM growth. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
