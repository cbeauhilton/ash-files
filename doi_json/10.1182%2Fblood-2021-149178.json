    "abstract_text": "Introduction In a previous observational study of 117 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (Allo-HSCT) recipients, we found that 83 % of them achieved a specific humoral response after two doses (V1 and V2) of BNT162b2 anti-SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA vaccine (Pfizer BioNTech). However, although 61.5% of the patients achieved the highest detectable IgG titers, this proportion remained significantly lower than what was observed in healthy controls, where 100% reached these highest antibody titers. Here, we investigated whether a third dose of vaccine would improve the anti- SARS-CoV-2 response in Allo-HSCT recipients. Methods This monocentric retrospective study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of a third vaccine (V3) of BNT162b2 in a cohort of Allo-HSCT adult recipients. Patients with previous clinical or asymptomatic biological COVID-19 infection at V1 were excluded from the study. A cohort of healthy volunteers (caregivers from the Clinical Hematology Department) who had also already received V1 and V2 was considered as controls. All participants were vaccinated between January 20 and June 1, 2021. Analyses were performed in July 2021. Antibody response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain was tested after V2 for all subjects (Serology post V2, SpV2) using the Roche Elecsys\u00ae assay. All subjects benefited later from another evaluation of specific serum antibodies as monitoring (Serology post V2+, SpV2+) or after V3 (Serology post V3, SpV3). Various serological methods were used for these later assays because performed outside of our hospital for some patients. Considering thresholds of negativity and positivity as well as highest values for each test, we were able nevertheless to distinguish 4 sub-groups: i) negativity at both SpV2 & SpV2+/SpV3, ii) increase of the IgG titer between SpV2 & SpV2+/SpV3, including patients showing seroconversion, iii) decreased or stable IgG titer between SpV2 & SpV2+/SpV3 and iv) highest IgG titers at both SpV2 and SpV2+/SpV3. Results A cohort of 25 controls and 114 patients, including 91 who received V3 (V3+) and 23 who did not (V3-) was considered for the purpose of this study. The characteristics of participants and delays from SpV2 to SpV2+ or SpV2 to SpV3 are reported in Tables 1 and 2 . The serological methods used for the latest assays are reported in Table 2 with criteria of negativity, positivity and highest IgG titer values. V3- patients were younger, with less myeloid disease than V3+ cases and had not received myeloablative conditioning. However, both V3+ and V3- groups shared similar median intervals between Allo-HSCT and V1, incidence of previous graft versus host disease (GVHD), proportions of patients under chemotherapy or immunosuppressive drugs and median lymphocyte counts at V1, suggesting similar immune status. The reasons for not receiving V3 were forgetting, refusal or surveillance after detection of the highest IgG titer at SV2. Samples from controls, all evaluated by Roche Elecsys\u00ae, showed the highest anti-spike antibody value (>250U/mL) at both SpV2 and SpV2+, suggesting a persistent response without the need of a third vaccine in this healthy population. The proportion of patients still negative at SpV2+/SpV3 was similar between V3- and V3+ patients (17% vs 12%, p=0.74). However, the proportion of patients showing a decreased/stable IgG titer between SpV2 and SpV2+/SpV3 was significantly higher for V3- cases (35% vs 4%, p=0.0001) ( Table 2 ). Moreover, the proportion of patients with the highest IgG titer at SpV2+/SpV3 was significantly higher in the V3+ sub-group (80% vs 43%, p=0.001), even if it remained significantly lower than in controls (p=0.03). The proportion of patients showing an IgG titer increase between SpV2 and SpV2+/SpV3 was higher in V3+ vs V3- patients (24% vs 4%, p=0.06). The difference was not significant as surprisingly one V3- case showed a seroconversion without any argument for SARS-CoV-2 infection between SpV2 and SpV2+. Three patients out of 14 (21%), with a negative SpV2, showed a seroconversion after V3. Finally, with a median follow up from V1 of 106 days in V3+ patients, 138 days in V3- patients and 154 days in controls, no COVID-19 infection was documented in any participant. Conclusion This study shows the interest of a third dose of BNT162b2 anti-SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA vaccine after allograft as more patients are documented with less decrease of IgG titers and the highest IgG values after V3.
