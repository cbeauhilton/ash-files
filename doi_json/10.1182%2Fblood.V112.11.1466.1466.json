    "abstract_text": "Background: The outcome of pts with HD-HIV is still poor, because the duration of complete remission (CR) is short. To improve the prognosis of HD-HIV, a feasibility study with the VEBEP regimen and HAART was started in previously untreated HD-HIV pts. Methods: Chemotherapy (CT) included epirubicin 30 mg/m 2 /day (days 1\u20133), cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m 2 (day 1), vinorelbine 25 mg/m 2 (day 1), bleomycin 10 mg/m 2 (day 3) and prednisone 100 mg/m 2 /day (days 1\u20133). Results: Since September 2001, 71 pts have been enrolled. The median age was 41 yrs. The median CD4 + cell count was 248/mm 3 and 51% of pts had a detectable HIV viral load. Stage III\u2013IV was present in 50/71 (70%) pts. Histologic subtypes were: MC 70%, NS 20%, LD 4%, LP 2%, unknown 4%. Four toxic deaths were observed (septic shock, PCP, hepatic failure and pneumonia during neutropenia). An absolute neutrophil count <500 was noted in 60% of pts. Grade 3\u20134 anemia was observed in 38% of pts and severe thrombocytopenia in 22% of pts. Twenty-two per cent of pts had febrile neutropenia with 19 documented infections in 16 pts (4 varicella, 4 bacterial pneumonia, 3 bacterial sepsis, 2 PCP, 1 cerebral toxoplasmosis, 1 esophageal candidiasis, 1 HBV reactivation, 1 HCV reactivation, 1 prostatitis, 1 salmonellosis). CR was obtained in 47/71 pts (66%) and PR in 9/71 pts (13%). With a median follow up of 22 months, only 4 pts have relapsed. OS and TTF at 24 months are 69% and 59%, respectively. Conclusions: Our preliminary data demonstrate that VEBEP regimen in combination with HAART is feasible and active in pts with HD-HIV. This study was supported by ISS grants.",
