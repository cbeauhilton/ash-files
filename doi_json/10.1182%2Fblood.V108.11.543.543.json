    "abstract_text": "Previously we found that haplotype 2 of the fibrinogen gamma gene (FGG-H2) is associated with an increased risk of deep venous thrombosis and with reduced fibrinogen \u03b3\u2032 levels, an alternatively spliced form of FGG, and reduced fibrinogen \u03b3\u2032/total fibrinogen ratios ( Blood  2005 ; 106 (13): 4176 \u201383 ). Two of the FGG-H2 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 9615C>T [rs2066864] and 10034C>T [rs2066865], are located in the region containing the two polyadenylation (pA) signals used in FGG pre-mRNA processing, namely pA1 and pA2, resulting in transcripts coding for \u03b3\u2032-chains and \u03b3A-chains, respectively. SNP 10034C>T is located in a Cleavage stimulation Factor (CstF) binding site at nucleotides 10030\u201310047 of FGG. CstF is a multi-subunit complex required for efficient cleavage and polyadenylation of pre-mRNAs. We hypothesized that 10034T, by strengthening this CstF binding site, favors use of pA2 (synthesis of \u03b3A-chains) at the expense of pA1-use (synthesis of \u03b3\u2032-chains). We transiently transfected FGG mini-gene constructs containing exon 9, intron 9 (containing pA1), exon 10 and the 3\u2032 UTR (containing pA2) in liver-derived HepG2 cells and used quantitative real-time PCR to measure the mean relative pA-signal usage (pA1/pA2 ratio) of the different constructs. To study the effects of SNPs 9615C>T and 10034C>T on the relative use of pA1 and pA2, we made constructs carrying the different alleles of these SNPs. Compared to reference construct CC (9615C, 10034C; FGG-H1) of which the pA1/pA2 ratio was set at 100%, the ratio of construct TT (9615T, 10034T; FGG-H2) was 1.4-fold decreased (71.5%, p=0.015). To investigate whether the SNPs individually or collectively caused the reduction in the pA1/pA2 ratio, exchange constructs CT (9615C, 10034T) and TC (9615T, 10034C) were also tested. The ratio of construct CT was almost 1.2-fold decreased (85.3%, p=0.001), while the ratio of construct TC did not differ significantly from the reference construct (101.6%, p=0.890). These results indicate that in our in vitro system SNP 10034C>T, and not SNP 9615C>T, is the major contributor to the reduction of the pA1/pA2 ratio. We further investigated the functionality and importance of the CstF binding site, containing 10034C>T, with a construct in which nucleotides 10013\u201310056 containing the complete CstF binding site were deleted. Compared to the reference construct, in which the CstF site was still present, the pA1/pA2 ratio of the CstF deletion construct was 2.2-fold increased (222.3%, pT is located in a functional CstF binding site and is involved in regulating the usage of the pA2-signal of FGG. We propose that the 10034C>T change is the functional variation in the FGG-H2 haplotype and is responsible for the reduction in the fibrinogen \u03b3\u2032/total fibrinogen ratio and the increased risk of deep venous thrombosis."
