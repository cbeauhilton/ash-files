    "abstract_text": "Introduction There are few studies on the behavior of vitamin D in patients undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT), although vitamin D serum levels are associated with use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs. In some studies, vitamin D deficiency in patients after HSCT is associated with reduced bone density, increased of parathyroid hormone and GVHD. Objectives To study vitamin D deficiency in patients undergoing to HSCT. Methods 51 patients who underwent HSCT at Albert Einstein Hospital, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, were studied (28 male, 23 female) with a mean age of 50 \u00b1 16 years, in the period from 2012 to 2013. Results 54 % had serum levels of vitamin D \u2264 50 nmol/l. And, 12% had serum levels of vitamin D \u2264 25 nmol/l. A multivariate analysis showed that more age and higher Body Mass Index (BMI) were significantly associated to lower serum levels of vitamin D. A negative correlation was found between BMI and serum level of vitamin D (r p =0,37). Conclusion The use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs and less lack of sun exposure during the HSCT and during the first year post-HSCT are associated with a greater tendency to deficiency of vitamin D. This deficiency can cause muscle and bone diseases, which can be prevented with diagnosis and early treatment. The deficiency of vitamin D should be carefully investigated in the elderly and obese patients. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
