    "article_date": "December 3, 2015",
    "session_type": "651. Myeloma: Biology and Pathophysiology, excluding Therapy: Sensitivity and Resistance Mechanisms",
    "abstract_text": "Lenalidomide (Len) and pomalidomide (Pom) are immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) effective in hematologic malignancies, in combination therapies for multiple myeloma (MM) in particular. Cereblon (CRBN), a component of the CRL4 CRBN E3 ligase, is required for IMiD's anti-myeloma activity. Emerging evidence suggests that IMiDs bind CRBN and block an endogenous substrate MEIS2 from binding to CRBN, thereby facilitating the recruitment of transcription factors IKZF1 and IKZF3 to CRL4 CRBN and their degradation. This then leads to loss of IRF4 necessary for myeloma survival. The clinical relevance of these novel findings, however, has not been defined. To address this question, we've investigated the mechanism of IMiD action and the functional consequences in freshly isolated primary bone marrow myeloma cells (BMMCs) (n=31) in stromal co-culture ex vivo in the context of the clinical response to Len or Pom in vivo before or after biopsy. We showed by whole transcriptome sequencing, protein analysis and functional assays that 1) BMMCs are addicted to IKZF3-IRF4 for survival; 2) Len-mediated IRF4 loss leads to de-repression of IRF7, induction of interferon (IFN) response genes and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis; and 3) the magnitude of IFN induction is tightly associated with killing of BMMCs by Len. Importantly, the IMiD sensitivity in BMMCs ex vivo correlated with the prior or subsequent clinical response to IMiD-based therapies in individual myeloma patients, suggesting that the clinical response to IMiDs in myeloma is largely intrinsic to myeloma cells. IMiDs have been reported to cause cell cycle arrest. We found that before evidence of killing, Len and Pom induced late G1 arrest by both repressing CCNA2 ( encoding cyclin A ) mRNA synthesis and elevating p21 and p27 proteins independent of Rb and p53. This result suggests that IMiDs preferentially kill cells in G1 arrest, and that induction of p rolonged early G1 arrest ( pG1 ) beyond the normal G1 transit time by selective inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 with palbociclib (PD 0332991, Ibrance) may sensitize MM cells to IMiD killing, as it does to killing by other agents. Indeed, induction of pG1 by palbociclib overrides cell cycle regulation by Len, and sensitizes BMMCs to Len-mediated apoptosis by augmenting the loss of IRF4 protein and the induction of IRF7, IFNb and TRAIL. Further investigation revealed that induction of pG1 by CDK4/CDK6 inhibition sensitizes primary myeloma cells to IMiD killing by rapid acceleration of Len-mediated loss of IKZF1 and IKZF3 proteins, within one hour of IMiD addition. Loss and gain of function studies demonstrates that MEIS2 opposes pG1 sensitization to Len killing; however, MEIS2 itself is regulated by the cell cycle. Induction of pG1 reduces the ratio of MEIS2 to CRBN by both reducing the MEIS2 protein rapidly and increasing the CRBN protein at a later time in cooperation with Len. In summary, our data provide the first evidence that induction of prolonged early G1 arrest by selective inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 amplifies IMiD killing of primary myeloma cells by both repressing MEIS2 and increasing CRBN protein in cooperation with Len. This leads to a profound reduction in the ratio of MEIS2 to CRBN that accelerates the loss of IKZF1, IKZF3 and IRF4, and enhances IFN and TRAIL induction. Reducing the MEIS2/CRBN ratio thus represents a novel mechanism by which CDK4/CDK6 inhibition sensitizes myeloma to IMiDs, and a means for developing mechanism-based IMiD therapy through cell cycle control.
