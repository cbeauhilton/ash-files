    "abstract_text": "Background: Various metrics have been used to evaluate the efficacy of erythropoietic agents for the treatment of chemotherapy-related anemia (CRA) including the proportion of patients attaining a \u22651 or \u22652g/dL increase in hemoglobin (Hb), Hb change from baseline at weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16, area under the change in Hb curve (Hb AUC) and the proportion of patients achieving a target Hb level. Many trial protocols and national treatment guidelines recommend dose escalation of these agents after the first 4 or 6 weeks of treatment if the patient fails to obtain a \u22651g/dL rise in Hb. Studies have also shown that an early Hb response is associated with improved clinical outcomes, i.e. lower transfusion requirements and greater gains in quality of life; but, it is not known how well early Hb response correlates with alternative efficacy metrics. Objective: To compare several alternative measures of treatment efficacy between patients who attained an early Hb response to those who did not while receiving an erythropoietic agent for treatment of CRA. Methods: Using preliminary data from an ongoing randomized, multi-center, 16-week, open-label trial of epoetin alfa versus darbepoetin alfa, we dichotomized patients based on early Hb response (\u22651 g/dL Hb rise during the first 4 weeks of treatment) and calculated several alternative measures of efficacy. Only observed, patient-level data were analyzed in the base-case analyses. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of employing various methods to handle missing data, excluding Hb values within 28 days following a transfusion, limiting analyses to patients with \u22658 or 12 weeks of follow-up, and limiting analyses to Hb values obtained after 4 weeks of treatment. Comparisons were performed using chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for categorical and continuous metrics, respectively. Results: 274 patients were analyzed; 134 had an early Hb response, 140 did not. The mean duration of follow-up was 10.1 weeks. All metrics indicated superior longer-term response among patients who had an early Hb response compared to those who did not. These findings were robust across sensitivity analyses.
