    "abstract_text": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are key regulatory RNAs that do not code for protein. Recently lncRNAs have been recognized as key regulators of gene expression and chromatin organization. Although, deregulation of lncRNAs such as HOTAIR, MALAT1 and H19 has been reported in solid cancers, role of lncRNAs in lymphoma or other hematologic malignancies is not known. The aim of this study is to identify lymphoma-associated lncRNAs and elucidate their role in disease pathogenesis. Next generation RNA-sequencing and validation studies were carried out on mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patient samples along with normal controls. As a result, hundreds of lncRNAs were found overexpressed in the MCL samples as compared with normal B cells, including RP11-24J23.2 (50 fold), RP11-12A2.3 (36 fold) and DLEU7-AS1 (19 fold). Quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) confirmed higher expression of RP11-24J23.2, RP11-12A2.3, and DLEU7-AS1 in MCL patient samples as compared to normal B cells. To investigate the biological significance of lncRNAs in MCL cells, we overexpressed RP11-24J23.2, RP11-12A2.3, and DLEU7-AS1 lncRNAs and analyzed effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis. To achieve overexpression lncRNAs, RP11-24J23.2, RP11-12A2.3, and DLEU7-AS1 were cloned individually in expression pcDNA3.1 generating constructs: pcDNA3 RP11-24J23.2 , pcDNA3 RP11-12A2.3 and pcDNA3 DLEU7-AS1 and then transfected into MCL cell lines along with pcDNA3.1. QRT-PCR revealed effective overexpression (~100 fold increase over baseline) for each transfected lncRNAs construct in Granta and Mino cells. Analysis of proliferation and survival showed that overexpressing RP11-24J23.2, RP11-12A2.3 or DLEU7-AS1 promotes cell proliferation and survival in these cells as compared to the vector controls. Most of the lncRNAs found so far have been linked to the transcriptional regulation of the target genes through their association with chromatin remodeling factors such as Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). To identify the functional relevance of RP11-24J23.2, RP11-12A2.3, and DLEU7-AS1 lncRNAs, we examined the binding of the lymphoma specific lncRNAs with PRC2 complex, by performing RNA immunoprecipitation (RNA-IP) using specific antibodies to EZH2, EED and SUZ12. The RNA-IP results demonstrate high affinity binding of all three lncRNAs with SUZ12 and EED but a weak binding with EZH2. Furthermore, RNA-IP using antibody to histone 3-lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a suppressive histone mark associated with PRC2 complex, also showed efficient binding with RP11-24J23.2, RP11-12A2.3, and DLEU7-AS1. These results suggest that RP11-24J23.2, RP11-12A2.3, and DLEU7-AS1 lncRNAs can directly associated with PRC2 complex at chromatin. To understand the mechanism of increased cell growth after overexpression of lncRNAs, RP11-24J23.2, RP11-12A2.3 or DLEU7-AS1, we analyzed expression level of important genes signature of MCL pathogenesis that include cyclin D1, cyclin D3, c-Myc, P14, and SOX11 , a member of the group C SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) transcription factor family. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of lncRNAs RP11-24J23.2, RP11-12A2.3 or DLEU7-AS1 enhanced the levels of cyclin D1 (>2 fold) mRNA without any impact on cyclin D3 or c-Myc transcript levels. In contrast overexpression of RP11-24J23.2, RP11-12A2.3 or DLEU7-AS1 lncRNAs decreased SOX11 (0.08, 0.1 and 0.06 respectively) and P14 (0.06, 0.7 and 0.40 respectively) mRNA expression in Mino cells. To gain understanding of the mechanism involved in the suppression of SOX11 by the lncRNAs, we performed Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with EZH2, EED and SUZ12 antibodies on Mino cells transfected with pcDNA3 RP11-24J23.2 , pcDNA3 RP11-12A2.3 and pcDNA3 DLEU7-AS1 or vector control. The data showed that overexpression of RP11-12A2.3 and DLEU7-AS1 significantly increased the binding of EED and to a lesser extent of EZH2 to SOX11 promoter while the binding of SUZ12 to SOX11 promoter was not changed as compared to vector alone. In conclusion, our results imply that lncRNAs are overexpressed in the MCL. Moreover, lymphoma associated lncRNAs (RP11-24J23.2, RP11-12A2.3 and DLEU7-AS1) regulate SOX11 expression via PRC2 complex contributing towards growth of MCL cells. Specific nature of lncRNAs found in lymphoma samples suggests that lncRNAs can be used as potential biomarkers for mantle cell lymphoma. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
