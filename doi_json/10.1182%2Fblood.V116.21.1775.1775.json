    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1775 Background: Clofarabine is a second-generation purine analogue currently FDA-approved for intravenous use for relapsed/refractory pediatric ALL. Purine analogues demonstrate significant clinical activity in non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), though clofarabine offers potential pharmacologic advantages over existing agents. Clofarabine is a more efficient substrate for deoxycytidine kinase, more completely inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase \u03b1, and demonstrates improved activity in cells that are non-dividing or have a low proliferation rate. This phase I trial is the first evaluation of an oral formulation of clofarabine in relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Patients and Methods: The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and define dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). Efficacy was a secondary objective. Patients (pts) were eligible if they had relapsed or refractory B-cell or T-cell NHL without prior stem cell transplant. All pts were required to have adequate organ function and performance status \u22642 as well as absence of both CNS involvement and HIV infection. No routine infectious prophylaxis was given. Patients were treated at 4 dose levels (1mg, 2mg, 4mg and ultimately 3mg) with oral clofarabine administered once daily on days 1\u201321 of a 28 day cycle for up to 6 cycles. Three to 6 pts were treated at each dose level in a traditional 3+3 design. Response assessment occurred after cycles 2 and 6. DLT was assessed during cycle 1 and was defined as Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia occurring for \u22655 days, any grade 3\u20134 non-hematologic toxicity, and grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity that did not recover prior to the subsequent cycle of therapy. Results: Twenty-one pts were enrolled on the dose-escalation phase of the study. The median age was 63 years (range 51\u201385). The median number of prior regimens was 2 (range 1\u20137). Histologies included follicular lymphomas (FL; 5 pts), small lymphocytic lymphomas (SLL; 5 pts), diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL; 4 pts), marginal zone lymphomas (MZL; 4 pts), mantle cell lymphomas (MCL. 2 pts) and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL; 1 pt). Median number of cycles administered was 5.5. No DLTs were observed at the 1mg or 2mg dose levels. Three pts were accrued at 4mg with 1 patient experiencing DLT of persistent grade 3 thrombocytopenia and grade 4 neutropenia. No additional DLTs occurred in the cohort, but the majority of pts required late dose reductions due to grade 3\u20134 hematologic toxicity. The dose was therefore de-escalated to 3mg and 6 additional pts were accrued. No DLTs were observed at the 3mg dose level with a median of 6 cycles administered (range 5\u20136); 3mg was declared the recommended phase 2 dose. Grade 3\u20134 hematologic toxicity included neutropenia (7 pts), thrombocytopenia (4 pts), and anemia (2 pts). Grade 1\u20132 non-hematologic toxicities were uncommon, and included fatigue, diarrhea, cough, and dizziness. There were no grade 3\u20134 non-hematologic toxicities. Seventeen pts completed one cycle of therapy and were evaluable for response. Radiographic disease reduction was observed in 11 of 17 pts (65%). The overall response rate (ORR) was 35% (6 of 17), all partial responses (PR). Responders included FL (2 pts), MZL (2 pts), SLL and LPL (1 pt ea.). ORR among low grade histologies (FL, MZL, SLL) was 43% in this phase 1 trial. Seven pts had stable disease, including 5 pts with reduction in tumor size that did not reach threshold for PR. Of the 4 pts with progressive disease, 2 had DLBCL, 1 had MCL and 1 had FL with biopsy following relapse identifying ALK-negative anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma. Of the 4 pts not evaluable for response, 1 pt died of progressive DLBCL during cycle 1 on dose level 1 and was replaced, 1 pt was the DLT pt on the 4mg dose level and was removed due to prolonged cytopenias, and 2 pts withdrew consent (1pt at 4mg, 1pt at 3mg), and were replaced. The 3mg dose level has been expanded in a 10-patient dose-expansion cohort limited to low-grade NHL and MCL. Conclusions: Oral clofarabine demonstrates encouraging tolerability and efficacy in relapsed B-cell NHL, particularly in low-grade histologies, warranting further investigation.
