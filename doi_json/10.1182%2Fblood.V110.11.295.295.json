    "abstract_text": "Dose density during early induction has been demonstrated to be one of the prime determinants for antileukemic efficacy. The German AML-CG therefore pilots a dose dense induction regimen S-HAM (sequential HD-AraC [3g/m2/12h d1,2,8,9] and Mitoxantrone 10mg/m2 [d3,4,10,11] followed by pegfilgrastim) in which two induction cycles are applied over 11 \u2013 12 days as compared to conventional double induction, in which two cycles are applied over 25 \u2013 29 days - thereby increasing dose density ca. two-fold in the critical first weeks of treatment. In the past 2,5 years 168 patients with de-novo AML (excluding APL) have been recruited into the trial with a median age of 53 years (range 18 \u2013 78). Of 136 patients evaluable for response the following results were achieved: CR 62%, CRi 22%, PL 7%, ED 9% - resulting in an overall response rate (ORR) of 84%. The early death rate (ED) of 9% and the toxicity profile compared favourably with a historical control group of the AML-CG 1999 study (de-novo AML, < 60 years, HAM-HAM double induction) which demonstrated an ED rate of 14% (ORR 68%, persistent leukemia (PL) 18%). The high antileukemic efficacy of S-HAM was also demonstrated by the fact that 89% of patients had a blast count of < 10% one week after therapy as compared to less than 48% of patients of the HAM-HAM double induction group. Whereas even for patients with unfavourable cytogenetics (including complex aberrations) a median overall survival of 13,5 months was reached (23% at 2 years), for patients with favourable karyotypes overall survival at 2 years was 81%and for patients with intermediate karyotypes 74% after S-HAM treatment. Importantly the compression of the two induction cycles into the first 11 \u2013 12 days of treatment seems actually beneficial for normal hematopoesis as demonstrated by a significantly shortened duration of critical neutropenia of 30 days as compared to 45 days after conventionally timed double induction. This shortening of critical neutropenia by more than 2 weeks was highly relevant for the duration of hospital stay and hospital costs. In conclusion S-HAM with pegfilgrastim support is a highly effective regimen in primary de-novo AML with a very favourable safety profile and significantly shortened duration of neutropenia. This regimen will therefore constitute the (dose-dense) experimental arm for a randomized comparison with standard double induction in the next generation of the German AML-CG studies.",
