    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5073 Introduction Conformational changes in von Willebrand factor (VWF) exposed at the injured vessel wall initiate platelet tethering and simultaneously trigger signaling cascades leading to platelet adhesion, spreading, and thrombus formation. Although the intracellular signaling protein 14-3-3\u03b6 and the membrane skeleton protein filamin A have been confirmed to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of GPIb\u03b1 and involve in the regulation of VWF binding function, whereas, the mechanisms still remain unclear. We have recently identified a novel 14-3-3\u03b6 binding site with partial phosphorylation of Ser559 in resting platelets located in the cytoplasmic filamin A binding domain of GPIb\u03b1. Disruption of the central cytoplasmic 14-3-3\u03b6 binding site of GPIb\u03b1 did not abolish the interaction between 14-3-3\u03b6 and GPIb-IX, whereas obviously diminished VWF binding function. Here we show that disruption of 14-3-3\u03b6 binding to GPIb\u03b1 by GPIb\u03b1 mutants or cell permeable peptides enhances the association of filamin A with GPIb-IX and the expression of GPIb-IX in the plasma membrane. In contrast, disruption of 14-3-3\u03b6 binding to GPIb\u03b2, which would enhance the opportunity for 14-3-3\u03b6 monomer to bind to GPIb\u03b1, reduces filamin A-GPIb-IX interaction and GPIb-IX membrane expression. Compared with a GPIb-IX mutant truncating the whole cytoplasmic domain of GPIb\u03b1 (\u0394551), GPIb-IX mutant retaining only the central 14-3-3\u03b6 binding site of the cytoplasmic domain of GPIb\u03b1 (\u0394565) showed an enhanced cell adhesion to VWF under flow and ristocetin-induced VWF binding. Furthermore, the two cell permeable peptides, MP-P and MP\u03b1C, which had been confirmed to block the central 14-3-3\u03b6 binding site of GPIb\u03b1 (MP-P) or diminished the association of 14-3-3\u03b6 with GPIb-IX complex (MP\u03b1C), obviously inhibited ristocetin induced wild-type GPIb-IX cell aggregation. In addition, MP-P and MP\u03b1C inhibited botrocetin-induced platelet spreading and lamellipodia formation on VWF matrix, and GPIb-IX-VWF interaction induced co-immunoprecipitation of Src with GPIb-IX. Taken together, these data indicate that the binding of 14-3-3\u03b6 and filamin A to the central cytoplasmic domain of GPIb\u03b1 involves in regulation of surface expression, VWF binding and signaling functions of glycoprotein Ib-IX.
