    "abstract_text": "Colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) is the major regulator of tissue macrophage development and function. The effects of CSF-1 are mediated by the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R), a class III receptor tyrosine kinase belonging to the PDGF receptor family. To study CSF-1R structure/function in macrophages using both genetic and proteomic approaches, we developed a novel, CSF-1R-deficient, mouse bone marrow macrophage (BMM) line (MacCsf1r\u2212/\u2212) ( Yu et al., J. Leuk. Biol.  84 : in press, 2008 ). MacCsf1r\u2212/\u2212 macrophages are maintained in GM-CSF. Retroviral expression of the wild type CSF-1R fully rescued the CSF-1-induced survival, proliferation, differentiation and morphological characteristics, which resemble those of primary BMM. We have studied CSF-1-induced covalent modifications of the receptor in MacCsf1r\u2212/\u2212 cells. Activation of the CSF-1R involves ligand-induced receptor dimerization and trans-phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domains. Besides tyrosine phosphorylation, CSF-1 stimulation results in disulfide bonding of the CSF-1R dimers and cysteine mutagenesis experiments revealed that specific residues in the kinase domain are involved. Inhibition of the disulfide bond formation significantly compromised CSF-1-induced CSF-1R tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating its requirement for full receptor activation. Analysis of the regulation of CSF-1-induced CSF-1R interchain disulfide bonding revealed the participation of third party molecules with additional CSF-1R post-translational modifications. The importance of ligand-induced disulfide bonding for class III receptor tyrosine kinase activation may not be restricted to the CSF-1R as interchain disulfide bonding of PDGF receptor dimers is also ligand-induced.",
