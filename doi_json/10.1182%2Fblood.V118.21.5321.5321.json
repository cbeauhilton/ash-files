    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5321 OBJECTIVES: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) are widely used to accelerate haematopoietic recovery after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Regulatory approval of biosimilar G-CSFs in Europe has been on the basis of comparable efficacy, safety and quality as the originator product. However, data are not presently available for all G-CSF clinical settings. This is the first reported use of a biosimilar G-CSF for neutrophil recovery after BMT. METHODS: A total of 23 consecutive patients (12 male, 11 female; mean \u00b1 SD age 47 \u00b1 13 years) with haematological malignancy (multiple myeloma, n=12; Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, n=6; non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, n=4; acute myeloid leukaemia, n=1) were recruited at a single-centre. Nineteen patients were receiving their first BMT while it was the second autograft for 4 patients. Mobilisation chemotherapy consisted of high-dose (HD) VEP (n=14), ESHAP (n=4), HD Ara-C (n=3), HD cyclophosphamide (n=2) or ICE (n=1). Patients received biosimilar G-CSF (EP-2006, Sandoz Biopharmaceuticals) after myeloablative chemotherapy (primarily BEAM or melphalan 140/200 mg/m 2 +/\u2212 bortozemib) with or without radiotherapy followed by autologous BMT. G-CSF therapy was started when absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was <0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /l and was continued until ANC reached >1.5 \u00d7 10 9 /l for 3 consecutive days. Response was evaluated after BMT using International Uniform Response Criteria. RESULTS: Mean \u00b1 SD number of CD34+ cells collected before transplantation was 10.1 \u00b1 4.0 x10 6 /kg/body weight. After BMT, one patient had a stringent complete response (CR), 7 patients had a CR, one patient a near CR, one patient a very good partial response (PR), 12 patients a PR, and one patient had progressive disease (overall response 96%). Mean recovery to ANC >0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /l was 13.0 \u00b1 4.0 days. Mean duration until platelet recovery >20 000/ml was 16.1 \u00b1 4.4 days (not achieved in 5 patients at last available assessment). Mean duration of treatment with biosimilar G-CSF was 14.4 \u00b1 5.1 days (range 6\u221223). Patients required antibiotics on a median of 4 days (range 1\u22126). Five patients (22%) experienced neutropenic events (neutropenic fever, n=4 and neutropenic enterocolitis and sepsis, n=1). Mean number of days in hospital was 28 \u00b1 6. CONCLUSION: Biosimilar G-CSF appears to be effective in reducing the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by autologous BMT. The use of biosimilar G-CSFs may result in cost savings in cancer supportive care budgets. Disclosures: Dmoszynska: Mundipharma: Advisory Board; Roche: Honoraria.",
