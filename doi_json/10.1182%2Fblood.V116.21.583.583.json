    "abstract_text": "Abstract 583 NK cells are a central component of the cytotoxic lymphocyte compartment capable of lysing tumor cells without prior immune sensitization of the host. The mechanisms leading to activation of NK reactivity are described by the principles of \u2018missing-self' and \u2018induced-self', which imply that cells with a low or absent expression of MHC class I (\u2018missing-self') and/or a stress-induced expression of ligands of activating NK receptors like e.g. NKG2D (\u2018induced-self') are preferentially recognized and eliminated by NK cells. Thus, a balance of various activating and inhibitory signals determines whether NK cell responses are initiated or not. Tumor cells often downregulate expression of MHC class I to evade T cell-mediated immune surveillance, which results in enhanced NK susceptibility. Besides the direct interaction with their target cells, NK activity is further influenced by the reciprocal interplay with various other hematopoietic cells. We and others demonstrated previously that thrombocytopenia inhibits metastasis in murine models, which is reversed by additional depletion of NK cells (e.g., Jin et al., Nature Med. 2006, Palumbo et al., Blood 2005). However, the mechanisms by which platelets impair NK-tumor interaction are largely unclear, especially in humans. Recently we reported that platelets release TGF-\u03b2 upon interaction with tumor cells causing downregulation of NKG2D on NK cells, which impairs anti-tumor immunity by disturbing the principle of \u201cinduced self\u201d ( Kopp et al., Cancer Res. 2009 ). Here we demonstrate that platelets further enable tumor cells to evade NK cell immune surveillance by preventing detection of \u201cmissing self\u201d: We found that tumor cells rapidly get coated in the presence of platelets, the latter expressing large amounts of MHC class I on their surface. In case of MHC class I-negative or -low cancer cells, this process results in MHC class I \u201cpseudoexpression\u201d on the tumor cell surface as revealed by flow cytometry, immunofluorescent staining, and electron microscopy. Platelet-derived MHC class I was found to inhibit the reactivity of autologous NK, both upon activation with cytokines and, most importantly, in cultures with platelet-coated tumor cells. Using constitutively MHC class I-negative/low tumor cells we found that blocking MHC class I restored NK cytotoxicity and IFN-\u03b3 production against platelet-coated tumor cells, but did not alter NK reactivity against the tumor cells in the absence of coating platelets. Taken together, our data indicate that platelets enable a molecular mimicry of tumor cells, allowing the latter to downregulate MHC class I in order to escape T cell immunity without inducing sufficient NK tumor immune surveillance due to conferred platelet-mediated \u201cpseudo self\u201d.
