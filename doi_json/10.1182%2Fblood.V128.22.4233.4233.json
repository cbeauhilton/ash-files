    "abstract_text": "Background: Resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) can either originate from mutations in the BCR-ABL1 gene, which are mostly well characterized, or emerge from unknown alternative mutations elsewhere in the genome. Small hairpin (sh)RNA screens have been used to discover such genes but are becoming limited due to sup-optimal protein depletion and non-reliable off-target effects. More efficient screening techniques in human cells are now available as a result of the increasing understanding of the CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) /Cas9 system. Aims: Our goal is to uncover imatinib (IM)-sensitizing genes that cause IM resistance when knocked-out. Characterizing these genes may help understand the mechanisms of IM uptake, metabolism, degradation and/or activity in CML cells. Additionally, we also expect to unveil alternative, BCR-ABL1 independent, oncogenic pathways in CML cells. Methods: In order to find other genes involved in IM resistance, we performed a genome scale CRISPR knock-out (GeCKO) screen, which contains 121,413 sgRNAs that target 20,914 protein coding genes and miRNAs. We transduced one sgRNA per cell and challenged the K562-GeCKO cell pool to IM selection. We compared the abundance of sgRNAs between pre/post-IM treatment by next generation sequencing (NGS). Results: After IM selection, the sgRNAs from surviving cells were identified by NGS and unveiled potential IM-sensitizing genes. The most enriched sgRNAs (FDR < 0.01) targeted genes involved in transcriptional ( KLF1 , MED24 ) and translational ( EIF2AK1 , UBE2M ) regulation, apoptosis ( BAX , BCL2L11 ) and cell cycle regulation ( BAP1 , SPRED2 ). Subsequent screens on LAMA84 cells are currently underway in order to validate our findings. Additionally, the establishment of individual gene knock-out cell lines are in progress in order to fully understand the role of each gene in IM resistance. Summary/Conclusion: Using a CRISPR knock-out screen, we produced a list of 19 genes (FDR < 0.05) that may play a role in IM resistance. Encouragingly, a subset of these genes ( BAX , BAP1 , BCL2L11 and SPRED2 ) have already been correlated to CML progression and/or TKI resistance in the past. We aim to bolster our findings by establishing individual gene KO cell lines and study resistance in LAMA84 cells. The utilization of CRISPR libraries may not only help understand TKI resistance in CML, but also help identify numerous novel genes involved in drug resistances for a myriad of different diseases.
