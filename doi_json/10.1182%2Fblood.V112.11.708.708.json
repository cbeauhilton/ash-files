    "abstract_text": "STAT3 signaling has emerged as a negative regulator of inflammatory responses in immune cells. In bone-marrow derived antigen-presenting cells (APCs), genetic or pharmacologic disruption of STAT3 led to inflammatory cells that effectively prime antigen-specific T-cell responses and restore the responsiveness of tolerized T-cells. In contrast, enhanced Stat3 activity in APCs resulted in increased production of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 and induction of T-cell tolerance 1 . B-cell lymphomas being tumors derived from B-lymphocytes display intrinsic antigen-presenting capabilities. Augmentation of this APC function has been shown to result in effective anti-lymphoma immunity 2 . In this study we determined whether targeting Stat3 signaling might influence the intrinsic APC function of malignant B-cells and the responsiveness \u2013or not- of antigen-specific CD4 + T-cells. First, we specifically block STAT3 signaling in A20 lymphoma B-cells by using a dominant negative variant of STAT3, Stat3b. Inhibition of STAT3 resulted in tumor cells capable not only of fully priming nai\u0308ve antigen-specific CD4 + T-cells but also able of restoring the responsiveness of tolerant T-cells from lymphoma bearing mice. Conversely, transfection of A20 B-cells with Stat3c, a constitutively activated mutant form of STAT3, led to T-cell unresponsiveness. Of note, manipulation of STAT3 in B cell tumors was associated with changes in the mRNA expression and protein levels of IL-10. Second, we evaluated the effects of two novel Stat3 inhibitors, CPA-7 (a platinum-containing compound that disrupts STAT3 DNA binding activity) and S3I-201 (inhibitor of Stat3:Stat3 complex formation and Stat3 DNA binding and transcriptional activities) in a murine model of Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL). In vitro treatment of FC-muMCL1 cells - derived from a tumor elicited in Em-Cyclin D1 transgenic mice- with increasing concentrations of either CPA-7 or S3I-201 resulted in an enhanced presentation of OVA-peptide to nai\u0308ve CD4 + T-cells specific for a MHC class II restricted epitope of ovalbumin (OT-II cells). Indeed, these T-cells produce higher levels of IL-2 and IFN-gamma compared to anti-OVA T cells that encountered cognate antigen in untreated FC-muMCL1 cells. More importantly, MCL cells treated with CPA-7 restored the responsiveness of tolerized anti-OVA CD4 + T-cells. Finally, in vivo treatment of MCL-bearing mice with CPA-7 (5 mg/kg/iv given on days +21, +24 and +27 after tumor challenge) resulted in significant inhibition of p-Stat3 in malignant B-cells and augmentation of their APC function. Taken together, STAT3 signaling is involved in the regulation of the antigen-presenting capabilities of B-cell lymphomas and as such represents a novel molecular target to augment the immunogenicity of these tumors.",
