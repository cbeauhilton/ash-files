    "abstract_text": "Introduction . Polycythemia Vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by peripheral erythrocytosis, increased thrombotic risk affecting morbidity and mortality. Low-dose aspirin once-daily (od) is currently recommended for cardiovascular prevention in PV. However, it has been recently suggested that aspirin should be used at 100 mg twice-daily (bid) in PV patients at high cardiovascular risk (JAK2V617F allelic burden, age >60 years) on the assumption of a shorter lasting antiplatelet effect, similarly to essential thrombocythemia. However, pharmacological and clinical data supporting the need for a bid ASA regimen in PV are missing. Methods . We studied the platelet responsiveness to standard aspirin (100 mg od) in PV patients, assessed at the end of the 24-h dosing interval. Patients were diagnosed according to the WHO 2008 criteria, were all on od low-dose aspirin and underwent a run-in phase (7-10 days) where aspirin tablets were always ingested at breakfast. Routine hematochemistry, genotype and allelic burden, clinical characteristics and history, medications were recorded. Serum thromboxane B 2 (sTXB 2 ) was measured as ex vivo biomarker of aspirin pharmacodynamics, urinary 11-deidro-TXB 2 (TXM) as in vivo index of platelet activation, the major urinary prostacyclin metabolite, 2,3 dinor 6-keto-PGF 1\u03b1 (PGIM), the urinary isoprostane 8-iso-PGF 2\u03b1 and plasma salicylic acid esterase activity. Results . Forty-nine patients (67\u00b110 years, 16 females) on aspirin for \u22651 month gave their informed consent; aspirin compliance and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug intake were checked by phone calls and patient's interview on the day of the visit. Nine patients were on phlebotomy only, while the remaining patients were on phlebotomy and hydroxyurea to keep the hematocrit <45%. Average hematologic values were: hematocrit 43.8\u00b13%; erythrocytes 5.3\u00b11.3x10 6 /\u00b5L; leukocytes 9.1\u00b14.3x10 3 /\u00b5L, platelets 359\u00b1165x10 3 /\u00b5L, immature platelets 11.8\u00b17.4x10 3 /\u00b5L. The median sTXB 2 value was 8.6 [2-50] ng/ml, urinary TXM 509 [205-3428] pg/mg creatinine, 8-iso-PGF 2\u03b1 768 [234-2104] pg/mg creatinine, PGIM 172 [120-275] pg/mg creatinine, plasma esterase activity 53 [47-60] \u00b5mol/L salycilic acid/min. Overall, sTXB 2 significantly (p<0.01) correlated with immature platelets (rho=0.46), erythrocyte count (rho=0.41), leukocytes (rho=0.39). Patients were then divided according to sTXB 2 tertiles, and patients in the lowest tertile showed sTXB 2 levels within the expected range (3.4 [2.4-4.2] ng/ml, Figure). The patients in the upper tertile of sTXB 2 levels (19.8 [15.3-40.9] ng/ml) were characterized by significantly (p<0.05) higher erythrocyte counts, total platelet counts, and immature platelets (p=0.05), while age, JAK2V617F allelic burden, leukocytes, hematocrit, hemoglobin, and sex distribution were comparable across tertiles. Urinary TXM significantly (p<0.05) correlated with sTXB 2 (rho=0.39 and Figure), disease duration (rho=0.33), and leukocytes (rho=0.33). By multivariable analysis, only sTXB 2 (p=0.009) positively predicted urinary TXM excretion. Urinary PGIM correlated with 8-iso-PGF 2\u03b1 excretion but not with TXM. Plasma esterase activity correlated with hemoglobin levels (rho=0.33, p=0.04), but not with the hematocrit, erythrocyte count, urinary TXM or sTXB 2 . JAK2V617F burden was significantly associated with polymorphonucleate count (rho=0.65), hemoglobin (rho=-0.49), and male sex (rho=0.41) while it was unrelated to previous thrombosis, sTXB 2 , urinary TXM and PGIM. By multivariable analysis JAK2V617F allelic burden predicted leukocyte counts only. Conclusions . A fraction of PV patients characterized by high erythrocyte, platelet and immature platelet count have a reduced response to a standard regimen of low-dose aspirin, which may contribute to persistently enhanced in vivo platelet activation. An improved antiplatelet regimen should be tested in these patients. View large Download slide View large Download slide Close modal Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
