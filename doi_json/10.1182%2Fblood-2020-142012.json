    "abstract_text": "Introduction B-ALL with TP53 mutations ( TP53 MT ) at diagnosis is associated with older age and frequent low-hypodiploid karyotype. We have previously shown that hyper-CVAD-based regimens negate the poor prognostic impact of TP53 MT . However, the prognostic effect of TP53 MT in B-ALL treated with mini-HCVD-inotuzumab with or without blinatumomab in the frontline and R-R settings have not been explored. Methods Older (\u226560 yrs) pts with newly-diagnosed ALL and adults (\u226518 yrs) with R-R ALL treated with mini-HCVD-inotuzumab ozogamicin with/without blinatumomab underwent testing for TP53 MT . We compared the clinico-pathologic & outcome differences between TP53 MT and TP53 wt cases in both settings. Germline origin was inferred based on persistence of TP53 MT at high variant allele frequency (VAF) during remission. Multiallelic (>1) TP53 alteration was defined as a concurrent second TP53 MT or deletion (TP53 del ). Results Of the 48 pts with newly diagnosed B-ALL, 19 (40%) pts had TP53 MT at diagnosis; in 2 of 14 (14%), TP53 MT was of germline origin. All pts were Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) negative; 1 pt had CRLF2 rearrangement (Ph-like immunophenotype); none had KMT2A rearrangement ( KMT2Ar ). Fifteen (83%) pts had 1 TP53 MT , 2 had 2 mutations, and one pt had 3 mutations. The majority were missense (15, 83%), the rest included non-sense, frame-shift, and splice site mutation in 1 patient, each. The median TP53 MT VAF was 46% (range, 4-80). Nine (56%) had multiallelic TP53 alteration, with 6 (38%) showing TP53 del . Compared with TP53 wild-type ( TP53 wt ), TP53 MT had a higher frequency of low-hypodiploidy (40% vs. 8%, p=0.04), lower median platelet counts (34 vs. 55, p=0.02), and a trend for older age (median 71 vs. 68, p=0.09). There was no difference in morphologic response rates (89% vs. 100%; p=0.11) and minimal residual disease negativity [MRD neg] rates (94% vs. 75%; p=0.13) between mutated and wild type groups. Over a median follow-up (f/u) of 46 months, 21 (44%) patients died [9 (50%) mutated vs. 12 (44%) wild type]. There was no significant difference in the overall survival (median OS, 33 vs. 38 months, p=0.28; Fig 1A ); the 3-year survival rates were 45% and 63% in TP53 MT and TP53 wt , respectively. Of the 47 pts with R-R B-ALL, 16 (34%) had TP53 MT . Three (3/12, 25%) had germline TP53 MT . All were Ph-negative, and 1 patient was Ph-like ALL. All 16 patients had a single TP53 MT ; 9 (56%) had multiallelic TP53 alteration due to concurrent TP53 del . Majority were missense (12, 75%), the rest included 2 non-sense, 1 frame-shift and 1 in-frame duplication. The median TP53 MT VAF was 33% (range, 1-78). Except for a higher frequency of low-hypodiploidy (30% vs. 0%, p=0.01), no other significant clinico-pathologic differences were noted between the TP53 MT and TP53 wt groups. Pts with TP53 MT had a higher morphologic response rate (100% vs. 67%, p=0.02) with no difference in MRD neg rates (78% vs. 85%, p=0.65). Over a median f/u of 33 months, 15 TP53 MT pts (94%) died compared to 14 TP53 wt pts (45%; p=0.001). Pts with TP53 MT had significantly shorter median survival (5 months vs not reached, p=0.0003; Fig 1B ); the 3-year survival rates were 0% and 52% in TP53 MT and TP53 wt , respectively. Despite significant differences in outcome of TP53 MT at diagnosis vs. relapse, there were no notable differences in TP53 MT characteristics, except for enrichment of KMT2Ar in R-R (0% vs. 31%; p=0.04). We retrospectively reviewed the cytogenomic features at the time of diagnosis of 7 R-R B-ALL with TP53 MT (non-germline). None had TP53 del at diagnosis. TP53 NGS profiling at diagnosis on one KMT2Ar pt was negative for TP53 MT (1% sensitivity) and TP53 del ( Fig 1C ). These findings suggest that TP53 MT / TP53 del clones (undetectable at diagnosis) expanded following chemotherapy and relapsed with cytogenetic evolution. TP53 MT clones that survived the chemotherapy insult were inherently more aggressive than treatment na\u00efve clones at diagnosis, and may explain the observed differences in outcome. Conclusions TP53 MT is seen in up to 40% of B-ALL at diagnosis and ~35% at relapse, and are associated with low-hypodiploid karyotype. B-ALL with TP53 MT at diagnosis shows no significant difference in OS compared to TP53 wt in patients treated with frontline mini-HCVD-inotuzumab with or without blinatumomab regimen. In contrast, TP53 MT confers a poor prognosis in pts with R-R disease. Sequencing studies on additional R/R TP53 MT patients at diagnosis are underway.
