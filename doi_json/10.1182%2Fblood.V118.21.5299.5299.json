With recent improvements in medical therapy, patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia, i.e ., thalassemia major, are living longer. As a result, there is a greater need to address endocrine complications related to chronic iron overload. Adrenal insufficiency (AI), in particular, is important to identify because therapies are available and can be life-saving. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to determine the prevalence of AI in our population of subjects with thalassemia major; to identify risk factors that predict AI in these individuals; and to localize the origin of the AI within the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Methods: This is a prospective study of individuals with thalassemia major with an enrollment goal of 30 subjects. All subjects enrolled were initially tested for AI using a glucagon stimulation test. Those found to have AI (stimulated cortisol <18 mcg/dL) subsequently underwent an ovine corticotrophin-releasing hormone (oCRH) stimulation test for confirmatory purposes and to define the physiological basis for the AI. Results: Eleven subjects (8 - 29 years old, 6 female) have been enrolled to date. In our population of patients with TM, the prevalence of AI was 55%. There was no correlation between age, number of years transfused, or ferritin levels and AI. All male patients failed the glucagon stimulation test, whereas 5 of 6 females passed the glucagon stimulation test, p = 0.0024. There was no correlation between 8 AM ACTH levels and 8 AM cortisol levels. There was a significant correlation (p = 0.025) between 8 AM cortisol level and peak cortisol level following glucagon stimulation testing. Of the six subjects with AI, two subjects subsequently failed the oCRH stimulation test (peak cortisol < 21.9 mcg/dL). In these two subjects, peak oCRH ACTH levels were elevated, 144 and 164 pg/mL, respectively, suggesting primary adrenal insufficiency. Conclusions: We conclude that 8 AM cortisol level is a good predictor of adrenal insufficiency in our population, and can potentially be used as a simple screening test for AI with a strong negative predictive value. There appears to be a male predominance of AI in our population. This may indicate a protective role of female sex in this population. Two subjects had classic primary AI with robust ACTH levels in the face of inadequate cortisol production following oCRH testing. Four subjects (all males) who failed the glucagon stimulation test subsequently demonstrated normal ACTH and cortisol response to oCRH, indicating a possible hypothalamic origin to their AI. This dysfunction is likely independent of iron overload and warrants further investigation. Alternatively, these subjects may have impaired sympathetic nervous system function leading to hypoglycemic unawareness. Both outcomes are novel to the field and of medical significance.
