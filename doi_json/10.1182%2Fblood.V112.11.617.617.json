    "abstract_text": "Although classified as marginal zone lymphomas under the WHO classification, the molecular relationship between splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), and nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL) has not been clarified. Furthermore, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) can show clinical morphologic and immunophenotypic overlap with these entities and may present a diagnostic challenge. In this analysis of gene expression data generated using the Affymetrix U133plus 2.0 chip from 32 SMZL, 25 MALTs (GI, salivary gland and lung), 23 NMZL and 25 LPL, we aim to identify the molecular relationship between these pathological entities using unsupervised methods, identify disease specific signatures and markers using supervised methods and also the functional implications of these signatures using a modified gene-set enrichment analysis. Using hierarchical clustering, MALT lymphoma forms a tight cluster regardless of tumor site. In addition, SMZL and NMZL form another large cluster. LPLs are divided into 2 main clusters with occasional samples interspersed amongst the SMZL and NMZL. There is no correlation between the percentage of CD20-positive B-cells, CD3-positive T-cells or CD138- positive plasma cells or tissue origin of the tumor and the way the samples are clustered. However, the separation of the LPLs into 2 major cluster correspond to the presence and absence of underlying Waldenstrom Macroglobulinaemia (WM), suggesting that the genes distinguishing the 2 clusters are potential markers for differentiating WM LPL from non-WM LPL. Next, using supervised analysis we identified a cluster of genes including MMP7, LTF and SFRP2 with high signals specific to MALTs, while other genes including PRDM1 (BLIMP1), XBP1 and TNFRSF17 (BCMA) were specifically over-expressed in LPL. These may therefore represent novel diagnostic marker differentiating these entities. Several of these are further validated at the protein level using immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray. Consistent with the unsupervised analysis, SMZL and NMZL have little difference and share the over-expression of CD22 and WNT3 among other genes. Clustering of these samples based on the pathways and genesets that are enriched in the individual tumors as compared to their normal tissue counterpart showed a mutually exclusive pattern with significant enrichment of NFKB-related genesets and genes in LPL and MALT, and significant enrichment of B-cell receptor signaling genesets and genes in SMZL and NMZL. Our analysis, for the first time, describes the molecular relationship between these closely related lymphomas. In the process, we identified novel diagnostic markers that may differentiate these conditions and also new insights into molecular pathways that are differentially activated in the different conditions. These may represent potential therapeutic targets"
