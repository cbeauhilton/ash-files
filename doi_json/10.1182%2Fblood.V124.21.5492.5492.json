    "abstract_text": "Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis caused by HTLV-I, which is endemic in Japan, the Caribbean, and South America. ATLL cannot be cured with conventional chemotherapy thus urging the development of new therapeutic strategies. Histone deacetyalse (HDAC) inhibitors are broadly active anti-neoplastic agents, which have shown efficacy in T-cell lymphomas. At our institution we encounter a relatively high number of ATLL cases as compared to other regions in the U.S. We have conducted a pilot trial using AZT/interferon-\u03b1(IFN\u03b1) plus the HDAC inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) during maintenance therapy in acute (leukemia-type) ATLL. We hypothesized that VPA would reactivate HTLV-I leading to a cytotoxic T-cell immune response followed by reduction of residual blood circulating ATLL clones that normally persist during AZT/IFN\u03b1 therapy despite its suppressive effects. Supporting this notion, the addition of VPA to AZT/IFN\u03b1 resulted in reduction of HTLV-I proviral loads in treated patients and a sustained molecular response in one subject who is still alive >4.5 years later. More recently, we have tested newly available and more potent HDAC inhibitors using fresh primary leukemic ATLL cells and low-passage cell lines. Through HDAC inhibition, these agents reactivated HTLV-I Tax gene expression and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Belinostat, which is currently FDA-approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma, augmented ATLL cell death when added to AZT/IFN\u03b1 at nanomolar concentrations. Therefore, we have proposed a new pilot clinical trial using belinostat for the treatment of ATLL during post-induction therapy. The role of HDAC inhibitors in ATLL, pre-clinical laboratory studies involving these agents, and clinical trial design will be discussed at the meeting Disclosures Off Label Use: The use of HDAC inhibitors in adult T-cell Leukemia-lymphoma."
