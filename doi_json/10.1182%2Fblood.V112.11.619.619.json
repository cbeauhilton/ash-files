    "abstract_text": "Waldenstro\u0308m\u2019s macroglobulinemia (WM) is an incurable low-grade lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by bone marrow (BM) infiltration of a clonal population of small B-lymphocytes, plasmacytoid lymphocytes and plasma cells that secrete monoclonal IgM antibody. Because it is difficult to obtain tumor metaphases for karyotype studies, few recurrent chromosomal abnormalities have been reported and the genetic basis of the disease remains poorly defined. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive high-resolution study to identify genomic abnormalities involved in WM pathogenesis. Fifty-seven WM patients were analyzed using a combination of array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)(N=42); gene expression profiling (GEP)(N=22), DNA sequencing (N=24) and cIgM-FISH (N=57). Agilent 244A and Affymetrix U133 platforms were used in the aCGH and GEP experiments, respectively. An NF-\u03baB index was calculated from GEP data, as a surrogate marker of NF-\u03baB transcription activity. NFKB2 sub cellular localization was determined by immunofluorescence staining. Overall, 83% of samples have aCGH defined chromosomal abnormalities, with a median of 3 abnormalities per patient (range 0 to 27). We identified 16 recurrent regions of copy number change found in >5% (3 or more patients); 10 deleted and 6 amplified regions. The most common abnormality was the entire or partial deletion of 6q, identified in 40% of cases. Four nonoverlapped minimal deleted regions were identified on 6q (MDR1 to MDR4), each of them being present in at least 14 of 17 patients with the abnormality. Gain of 6p was the second most common abnormality (17%) and its presence was always concomitant with 6q loss. Other recurrent deletions were 13q14 (10%) and 7q22, 8p, 11q22-q23, 11q23-q24 and 17p11-p13 (7% each). Copy gains were identified as partial or entire gains of chromosomes 18 (17%), 4 (12%) and 3 (10%), 8q (10%) and Xq27.1-q28 (10%). Three patients had either homozygous deletions or LOH with mutations affecting both alleles of TRAF3 on 14q32. TRAF3 inactivation was correlated with an increased NF-kB transcriptional signature and it was associated with activation of the non-canonical NFkB pathway. Additionally, we identified the inactivation of TNFAIP3, another negative regulator of the NF-kB pathways, in one of 24 patients. Finally, interstitial deletions identified in 4 patients at 13q14 identified a 1.1 Mb MDR, including MIRN15A and MIRN16-1. These findings confirm that focal 13q14 deletion is not restrict to B-CLL and that the MIRN15A/MIRN16-1 abnormalities might be common to several indolent B-cell diseases. Overall, we identified TRAF3 and TNFAIP3 inactivation in 5.3% and 2.4%, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing the inactivation of bona fide tumor suppressor genes in WM patients. Furthermore, these genes are negative regulators of NF-kB signaling pathway, highlighting its biologic importance in sustaining and limiting growth in WM. Mutational activation of this pathway, which is normally activated by ligand-receptor interactions within the BM microenvironment, suggest a therapeutic role for inhibitors of NF-KB pathway activation in the treatment of WM."
