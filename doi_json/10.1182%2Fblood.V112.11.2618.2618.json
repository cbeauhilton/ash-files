    "abstract_text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), antibodies linked to potent cytotoxic drugs via specialized chemical linkers, provide a means to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy by targeting the drug to neoplastic cells while reducing side effects. We have previously shown that ADCs targeted to CD79b are highly effective in xenograft models of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Here we report the development of an ADC consisting of a humanized anti-CD79b antibody (hu-anti-CD79b) conjugated to monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) through engineered cysteines (THIOMABS) by a maleimidocaproyl-valinecitrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (MC-vcPAB) linker (hu-anti-CD79b-thioMAb-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE) that is designed to be cleaved by cathepsins. To determine the potential of this ADC, hu-anti-CD79b-thioMAb-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE (referred to as anti-CD79b-vcMMAE henceforth), as a therapeutic for NHL we interrogated its potency across a large panel of NHL cell lines. Strikingly, anti-CD79b-vcMMAE has very potent activity across a large panel of NHL cell lines in vitro with 68% (23 out of 34) cell lines having greater than 50% reduction in cell viability. Quantitative FACS across the cell line panel revealed that of the 11 insensitive cell lines, 9 had negligible surface CD79b, suggesting a threshold effect in that below a specific level of antigen on the cell surface resulted in cells being insensitive to anti-CD79b-vcMMAE. Within the sensitive cell lines, there was not a direct correlation per se with anti-CD79b-vcMMAE IC50 values and cell surface expression levels and this prompted us to investigate other potential molecular parameters. Gene expression profiling and gene set enrichment analysis revealed that genes predominantly involved in antigen processing and presentation and genes induced by IFN-gamma were significantly enriched in the less sensitive cell lines to CD79b-vcMMAE. Classifying our NHL cell lines as GCB or ABC subtypes by gene expression revealed that both ABC and GCB were responsive. In addition, the activity of anti-CD79b-vcMMAE was very potent in p53 mutant as well as p53 wild-type cell lines. Since the pre-clinical evidence suggests that anti-CD79b-vcMMAE will be a very promising drug candidate for NHL and we have established that cell surface expression is perhaps the best predictor of response, we wished to determine the prevalence of expression of CD79b on the cell surface of primary human lymphoma and CLL samples to estimate a patient population that may gain benefit. Strikingly, CD79b was detected in all cases of CLL, MZL, HCL, DLBCL, FL, and MCL. Furthermore, CD79b expression was detected in all cases that had relapsed from prior chemotherapy regimens, highlighting the clinical relevance of this target and potential therapeutic utility of anti-CD79b-vcMMAE. To assess the potential of anti-CD79b-vcMMAE in vivo we compared its efficacy to R-CHOP in three xenograft models of NHL. In all three models, a single dose of anti-CD79b-vcMMAE resulted in complete sustained tumor remission and was more effective than R-CHOP. These data suggest that anti-CD79b-vcMMAE could be broadly efficacious as a treatment for NHL."
