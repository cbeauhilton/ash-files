    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1134 Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder that results from deficiencies in coagulation factor VIII (FVIII; hemophilia A) or factor IX (FIX; hemophilia B), primarily impacting the intrinsic coagulation pathway. The extrinsic coagulation pathway remains intact in hemophiliacs and is negatively regulated by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). The primary role of TFPI is regulation of the FVIIa:tissue factor complex through inhibition of FVIIa and FXa. Inhibition of TFPI may provide an effective treatment for hemophilia by allowing sufficient thrombin generation via the extrinsic coagulation pathway to bypass the defect in clot propagation caused by deficiency of FVIII or FIX. ARC19499 is an aptamer that is a potent, specific inhibitor of TFPI. We have employed a variety of in vitro and in vivo methods to demonstrate that ARC19499 mediates a procoagulant effect in hemophilic plasma and in a model of hemophilia A in non-human primates (NHP). Plasma-based experiments that measure thrombin generation over time demonstrate that ARC19499 mediates a procoagulant response in both hemophilia A and hemophilia B plasma, restoring thrombin generation to near normal levels at 10 \u2013 100 nM aptamer. Experiments in TFPI-depleted plasma and in vitro binding experiments demonstrate that this procoagulant effect is dependent on the specific interaction between ARC19499 and TFPI. ARC19499 restores thrombin generation to a level that is equivalent to or better than 14% FVIII replacement at a concentration of 30 nM in hemophilia A plasma and has an additive effect on thrombin generation when used in combination with FVIII. In a NHP model of hemophilia, cynomolgus monkeys acquire a hemophilia A-like state following administration of an anti-FVIII antibody as measured by ex vivo thromboelastography (TEG). TEG coagulation parameters are corrected following administration of ARC19499 . In addition, antibody-mediated FVIII depletion moderately prolongs saphenous-vein bleeding time. ARC19499 corrects bleeding times to normal. These experiments demonstrate that the anti-TFPI aptamer ARC19499 mediates a procoagulant hemostatic effect both in vitro and in vivo in hemophilia model systems that is dependent on specific interaction between the aptamer and TFPI. ARC19499 may provide an effective alternative to replacement factors and bypassing agents for the treatment of hemophilia. Additionally, aptamer therapeutics have the advantage of subcutaneous bioavailability which provides an opportunity for improved treatment regimens in hemophilia.
