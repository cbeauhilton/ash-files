    "abstract_text": "Introduction Children with Down Syndrome (DS) frequently develop hematological malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), however, the genomic basis for the predisposition to DS-ALL remains unknown. DS-ALL is associated with increased rates of relapse, chemotherapy related toxicity and poor overall survival compared to non-DS patients. The P2RY8-CRLF2 ( CRLF2r ) gene fusion, the result of deletion of the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) on the X/Y chromosome (chr), has been identified in 60% of DS-ALL (+21) patients and 30% of iAMP21 (intrachromosomal amplification of chr21) ALL patients compared to only 5-16% of other B-ALL patients. The high mobility group nucleosome binding protein 1, encoded by HMGN1 on chr21 may play a role in DS-ALL leukemogenesis, due to its demethylase activity associated with transcriptional activation. Methods mRNA seq was performed on the blast cells of 76 ALL patients using the Universal Plus mRNA-seq with NuQuant kit. FusionCatcher, SOAPfuse and JAFFA were used to identify fusions and featureCounts used for mRNA expression of STAR (v2.7.3a) aligned BAM files. CRISPR/Cas9 gRNAs targeting P2RY8 intron 1 or CRLF2 5' UTR created the 320 KB (PAR1) deletion. Cas9/gRNAs were transduced into Jurkat cells \u00b1 HMGN1 overexpression, activated with doxycycline and stained with TSLPR (CRLF2/IL-7R\u03b1 dimer) for single cell sort and clonal expansion. Phosphorylated proteins were measured by intracellular flow cytometry and SYBR Green RQ-PCR was used for mRNA expression. Results Significantly higher HMGN1 expression was identified in CRLF2r ALL patients, compared to the control ( BCR-ABL1 + patients. Fig. 1A; p <0.0001). There was no significant difference in HMGN2 ( p =0.7881) or JAK2 ( p =0.1171) control genes between groups. Of the CRLF2r ALL patients, 26% harbored +21, and 5% iAMP21, strongly suggesting a relationship between chr21, HMGN1 and the CRLF2r fusion. To further understand the role of HMGN1 in CRLF2r development, HMGN1 was overexpressed (1.5-fold; HMGN1 H ) in Jurkat Cas9 cells to represent a trisomy level of expression. gRNAs targeting P2RY8 and CRLF2 were activated in cells \u00b1 HMGN1 H with undirected repair. TSLPR surface and CRLF2 mRNA expression were higher in CRLF2r + HMGN1 H cells compared to CRLF2r only cells (Fig. 1B,C; p =0.034 and <0.001 respectively). This suggests higher HMGN1 expression significantly predisposed to PAR1 deletion and formation of CRLF2r fusion after a double stranded DNA break (DSB) versus repair where HMGN1 expression is normal. This is consistent with higher HMGN1 expression observed in patients with CRLF2r . There was also increased gene editing activity in CRLF2r + HMGN1 H cells, identified through T7 gene editing assay, compared to CRLF2r only cells. CRLF2r  + HMGN1 H cells also demonstrated significantly increased pSTAT5 (MFI: 2359 \u00b1 1; Fig. 1D), pAKT (MFI: 2339 \u00b1 6; Fig. 1E) and pERK (MFI: 2478 \u00b1 48; Fig. 1F) compared to CRLF2r only cells (MFI pSTAT5: 1910 \u00b1 10; pAKT: 1727 \u00b1 14; pERK: 1946 \u00b1 6; all p <0.001), consistent with the data observed in CRLF2r patients, and confirming cooperation between CRLF2 and HMGN1 . CRLF2r  + HMGN1 H cells demonstrated reduced H3K27me3 (MFI: 1 \u00b1 0.07) compared to CRLF2r only cells (MFI: 1.6 \u00b1 0.03; p =0.003) and higher expression levels of STAT5 target genes ( BCL2 , CDKN1, MCL1 and MYC ). Conclusion The P2RY8-CRLF2 (CRLF2r) gene fusionis prevalent in DS, +21 and iAMP21 ALL patients. Here, we demonstrate that CRLF2r is associated with high expression of HMGN1 (chr21)in ALL patient cells . Using CRISPR/Cas9 in an in vitro model, we demonstrate that enforced high expression of HMGN1 alters DSB repair mechanism, favoring PAR1 deletion and the subsequent formation of the P2RY8-CRLF2 gene fusion, with attendant higher expression of STAT5 target genes. Understanding the role of HMGN1 in the disproportionate number of DS-ALL patients who are diagnosed with CRLF2r has the potential to lead to novel therapeutic interventions, in this high-risk group of patients where efficacious therapeutic options are currently poor.
