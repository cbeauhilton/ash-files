    "abstract_text": "Abstract 324 Introduction and classification: This is the largest adult T-ALL cohort treated according to immunologic subtypes. All patients were immunophenotyped in one central lab (Berlin). T-ALL (cyCD3+, CD7+) were subclassified into early T-ALL (sCD3-, CD1a-), thymic T-ALL (sCD3-/+, CD1a+) and mature T-ALL (sCD3+, CD1a-). T-ALL constitutes in 3 consecutive GMALL-studies 24% of ALL patients. Patients and methods: A total of 744 T-ALL pts (15 to 55 yrs) were accrued in 102 hospitals in the GMALL studies 05/93, 06/99 and 07/2003. In GMALL 05/93 239 adult T-ALL patients, were treated according to a multi-agent chemoprotocol. Stem cell transplantation (SCT) was not recommended in CR1. In GMALL studies 06/99 and 07/03 505 T-ALL pts received intensified chemotherapy; particularly with introduction of PEG-asparaginase in induction as well as HDMTX/PEG-Asp consolidation cycles. Based on study 05/93 results, SCT from sibling (Sib) as well as matched unrelated (MUD) donor in CR1 was recommended for all patients with early T-ALL, mature T-ALL and for high-risk (HR) pts with thymic T-ALL (defined as late CR, complex karyotype or MRD positivity (MRD+)). Results: T-ALL subtype distribution in the total cohort of 744 adult T-ALL was early-T 23% (N=170), thymic-T 56% (N=420), mature-T 21% (N=154), without any differences between the studies. GMALL Study 05/93: The overall CR rate was 86% (early-T 72%, thymic-T 93%, mature-T 84%. The lower CR rate in early T-ALL was mainly due to early death (19%). The overall CCR rate was 47% (early-T 45%, thymic-T 54%, mature-T 30%). The overall survival rate at 10 yrs for all pts was 47% (early-T 47%, thymic-T 55%, mature-T 25%). GMALL Study 06/99 and 07/03: Of the 505 patients, 87% achieved CR (early-T 84%, thymic-T 92%, mature-T 77%). PR/Failure was higher in early-T (13%) and mature-T (17%) compared to thymic-T (5%). Early death was 4% and equally distributed. 267 pts (64%) received chemotherapy only and the majority were 229 pts (86%) with thymic T-ALL, not considered for SCT in CR1. The CCR rate was 61%. The few early (n = 15) and mature (n = 23) T-ALL pts, which could not have a transplant in CR1, are a negative selection (e.g. early relapse, comorbidity, no donor) and their CCR rate was 33% and 22% respectively. This was due to a high relapse rate in early T-ALL (60%) and mature-T (74%) compared to 33% in thymic-T. Overall survival rate at 8 yrs for thymic T-ALL with chemotherapy was 68%, for the 77 adolescent pts (15 to 25 yrs) even 76%. Stem cell transplantation: 153 T-ALL pts in studies 06/99 and 07/03 received a SCT in first remission. SCT realisation rate in early T-ALL was 84%, in mature-T 68%. Overall CCR rate was 58% (early-T 47%, HR thymic-T 79%, mature-T 61%). Relapse rate after SCT was in early-T 33% and in mature-T 22%. The overall TRM rate was 18% despite more than half MUD SCT, without any TRM difference between the immunological subtypes. Overall survival rate after SCT in CR1 at 8 yrs was 53%, early-T 44%, thymic-T 67%, mature-T 59%. SCT modalit: 49% received alloSib, 55% alloMUD and 20% auto-SCT. Overall CCR rate after alloSib for the total cohort was 65% (early-T 60%, thymic-T 73% and mature-T 69%); for alloMUD total 55% (early-T 45%, thymic-T 77%, mature-T 61%) and for the small cohort of 20 pts with auto-SCT CCR was 35%. Conclusion: The strategy in three consecutive GMALL studies to stratify and treat adult T-ALL pts according to the immunologic T-subtypes was successful. Overall survival at 5 yrs could be improved to 56% from 44%. There was a particular improvement for mature T-ALL (49% vs. 30%) and early-T (40% vs. 33%). This was mainly due to a high realisation rate of SCT in early T-ALL and mature T-ALL and the substantial better results of SCT. Results of alloMUD SCT were comparable to alloSib SCT. The small cohort of HR thymic T-ALL pts also had a benefit from SCT. The excellent outcome of SR thymic T-ALL (\u223c 50% of all T-ALL) with the OS of 68% and 76% in adolescents due to intensified chemo, partic. PEG-Asp, does not suggest SCT in CR1. Several molecular markers, such as ERG, BAALC, WT1, had in a retrospective analysis some prognostic relevance in this pt cohort. The new GMALL study generation will however focus in thymic T-ALL on early evaluation of MRD to decide for SCT (MRD+) or not (MRD-) whereas early/mature T-ALL remain allocated to high risk groups with SCT in CR1.
