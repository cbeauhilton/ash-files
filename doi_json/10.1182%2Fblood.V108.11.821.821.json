    "abstract_text": "Follicular lymphoma (FL) is one of the most common B-cell lymphoma, and remains virtually incurable despite its relatively indolent nature. T(14;18)(q32;q21), the genetic hallmark and early initiating event of FL pathogenesis, is also present at low frequency (10 \u22125 \u201310 \u22127 ) in blood from healthy individuals (HI), indicating that t(14;18) and the ensuing BCL2 overexpression is necessary but not sufficient for malignant transformation. It has long been assumed that in HI, t(14;18) is carried by circulating quiescent nai\u0308ve B-cells, where its oncogenic potential would be restrained. Yet, several reports, including long-term persistence and immunomodulation of t(14;18)+ cells in lymphoma-free individuals, led us to question this model and investigate the status of circulating t(14;18)+ cells in HI. We first determined if t(14;18) + cells are nai\u0308ve B-cells by assessing class-switch recombination (CSR) on the translocated allele. Using 2 long-range PCR assays designed to amplify unswitched BCL2/S\u03bc and switched BCL2/Sg regions, DNA samples from 6 HI with t(14;18) were tested. Contrary to previous assumptions, our data clearly show that most peripheral t(14;18) + cells already underwent CSR (n=5/6) and therefore that most t(14;18) + cells are not nai\u0308ve B-cells. Are they then memory B cells? Nai\u0308ve and memory B cell subsets from 9 HI were isolated by cell sorting according to IgD and CD27 markers, and the rate of t(14;18) analyzed in each subset relatively to that of the total B cells. Strikingly, while the level of nai\u0308ve t(14;18) + cells remained at baseline for all individuals, memory B-cells tightly accounted for the wide modulation of t(14;18) frequencies observed between individuals. In addition, sequence analysis of t(14;18) clones revealed that this wide modulation was not due to the accumulation of clonally unrelated t(14;18) nai\u0308ve B-cells, but rather to the clonal expansion of t(14;18)-bearing memory B-cells. To further define the t(14;18) + cells, we next examined the repartition of the translocation in the IgD \u2212 /CD27 + and IgD + /CD27 + memory B-cell subsets. Unexpectedly, we found that the IgD + /CD27 + subset contained significantly higher rates of translocation than the IgD \u2212 /CD27 + , both in terms of prevalence and frequency. Thus, while CSR is found in the majority of translocated alleles (~75%), most t(14;18) + memory B cells have not switched their productive allele (~70%) and express an IgM/D. Most importantly, although atypical among physiological peripheral B-cells, this \u201callelic paradox\u201d is a specific hallmark of FL, and suggests the presence of the same selective pressure in favor of sIgM expression on a B-cell population that is at the same time permanently driven to switch. In line with B-cell hyperplasia in BCL2 transgenic mice slowly progressing to low grade lymphoma, it is likely that \u201cFL-like\u201d cells in HI are rescued by BCL2 from apoptosis, and \u201cfrozen\u201d at a differentiation stage in which constitutive AID expression drives continuous somatic hypermutation and CSR activity, two mechanisms conferring a high propensity for genomic instability. Altogether, our findings identify a novel intermediate step in early lymphomagenesis, and strongly impact both on the current understanding of disease progression from potent pre-malignant niches, and on the proper handling of t(14;18) frequency in blood as a potential early biomarker for lymphoma."
