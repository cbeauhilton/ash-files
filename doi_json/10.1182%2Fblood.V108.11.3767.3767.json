    "abstract_text": "Objective The exact reason of aplastic anemia is still unknown. Recently more and more researchers realized that immune factors play an important role in aplastic anemia. In this study, we detected the expression of CD28 on different subgroups of T cells in patients with aplastic anemia and furthermore studied the effect of cyclosporine A to CD28 and FLIP on these cells. Method 21 patients and 15 healthy controls were investigated. The Expression of CD4CD28 and CD8CD28 on patients\u2019 T cells was detected with FCM; patients\u2019 CD8 + T cells were purified with Mini MACR system, then the expression of FLIP, caspase-8 in CD8 + T cells were analyzed by RT-PCR; we also detected the expression of CD28, FLIP and caspase-8 in patients\u2019 CD8 + T cells after incubation with cyclosporine A. Result: The percentage of CD8 + CD28 \u2212 T cells in the patients is significantly higher than that of normal controls (30.45\u00b15.26% versus 19.32\u00b14.72%, p <0.05) and it can be induced to return to normal after effective treatment with Cyclosporine A; the expression of FLIP in patients\u2019 purified CD8 + T cells is higher than that in healthy controls\u2019 CD8 + T cells, but there is no difference in the expression of caspase-8; after being cultured with Cyclosporine A, the expression of FLIP in patient\u2019s CD8 + T cells was down regulated and the quantity of CD28 on the surface of patient\u2019s CD8 + T cells increased significantly (28.3\u00b15.1% versus 40.6\u00b17.71%40.6\u00b17.71%). Conclusion: The increased expression of FLIP in patients\u2019 CD8 + T cells is related to the increased percentage of CD8 + CD28 \u2212 T cells in patients\u2019 peripheral blood. Cyclosporine A can down regulate the FLIP expression and correct the abnormal percentage of CD8 + CD28 \u2212 T cells in patients with aplastic anemia."
