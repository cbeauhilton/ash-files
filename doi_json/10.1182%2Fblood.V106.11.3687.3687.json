    "abstract_text": "Like VEGF, morphine stimulates MAPK/ERK and Akt, leading to the promotion of angiogenesis via NO dependent signaling ( Cancer Res  62 : 4491 , 2002 ). Morphine acts via pertussis toxin (PT)-dependent G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRS), while VEGF acts via receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). We showed that PT-dependent GPCRs transactivate VEGF receptor-2/Flk1 via small GTPase RhoA ( JBC  277 : 4679 , 2002 ; JBC  278 : 20738 , 2003 ). Therefore, we hypothesized that morphine via the mu opioid receptor (MOR) transactivates Flk1 and promotes a pro-angiogenic microenvironment. Morphine-induced proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was completely abrogated by Y-27632 (100 \u03bcM), a highly selective and potent inhibitor of Rho-associated protein kinases, suggesting the activation of Rho signaling by morphine. Addition of 1 \u03bcM morphine potentiated VEGF-induced (10 ng/ml) proliferation of HUVEC by 25%. We observed a 30% increase in intracellular calcium release after VEGF stimulation of HUVEC pre-incubated with morphine as compared to HUVEC pre-incubated with PBS, detected by a change in the fluorescence ratio of the Fura-2 AM dye. These findings show that morphine, via MOR and Rho signaling, transactivates Flk1 leading to the stimulation of calcium signaling and endothelial cell proliferation. To functionally corroborate our hypothesis, we used MOR knockout (MOR-KO) mice and injected them with MOR-replete T241 fibrosarcoma cells. T241 fibrosarcoma tumor growth in vivo showed appearance of palpable and measurable tumors 2 days earlier in wild type (wt) as compared to MOR-KO mice. Tumor growth and angiogenesis were decreased by 20\u201335% in MOR-KO mice as compared to wt littermates during 3 weeks of tumor growth. None of the MOR-KO showed signs of lung metastasis versus 40% wt mice with metastasis. Morphine (1.42 for the first 2 wks and 2.14 mg/Kg/day later, respectively) stimulated 20\u201335% tumor growth in wt, but not in MOR-KO mice. Western immunoblotting showed a 10-fold increase in the expression of phospho-Flk1 in morphine treated wt tumors as compared to PBS-treated wt mice. Morphine did not stimulate phospho-Flk1 expression in MOR-KO mice. Western analysis of immunoprecipitates obtained with \u03b1-MOR antibody showed the expression of Flk1 and phospho-Flk1 in wt, but were not expressed in MOR-KO tumors. Thus, MOR stimulates the transactivation of Flk1 in wt mice but not in MOR-KO. These in vitro and in vivo data using MOR-KO mice and the MOR agonist, morphine, show that MOR stimulates endothelial proliferation, angiogenesis and promotes tumor growth and metastasis directly as well as by transactivating Flk1 phosphorylation. We speculate that MOR is a critical component of the \u2018angiogenic switch\u2019, which regulates the pro-angiogenic and growth promoting tumor microenvironment. Thus, MOR provides a novel target for developing anti-angiogenic therapies.",
