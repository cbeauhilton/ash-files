    "abstract_text": "Introduction In reduced intensity cord blood transplantation (CBT) post transplant immune disorders, including early immune reactions (PIR) and acute GVHD, are potential complications following CBT in adult patients. Such reactions might increase the risk of organ dysfunction, leading to high rates of transplantation-related mortality, particularly in patients who do not respond to primary therapy, which usually consists of steroids. There is no consensus on the optimal salvage treatment of steroid-refractory acute GVHD. Patients and Methods We retrospectively reviewed 388 patients who underwent single-unit reduced intensity cord blood transplantation consecutively from June 2008 to October 2012 at Toranomon Hospital. Patients who were in poor performance status (ECOG PS >3), had active bacterial or fungal infections at the time of conditioning were excluded. The most frequently used conditioning regimens were fludarabine, alkylating agent (melphalan or busulfan) with total body irradination (TBI), tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil for GVHD prophylaxis. Patients in whom acute GVHD developed received methylpredonisolone 1-2 mg/kg per day. If no partial or complete resolution of symptoms occurred, they were considered steroid-refractory and proceeded to salvage treatment with infliximab or ATG. The dose of infliximab was 5 mg/kg/day once weekly for at least 1 course. ATG was given at 1mg/kg/day once weekly for at least 1 course. An observational study compared response and survival rates in all consecutive patients receiving 1 of these 2 treatments. Results 52 patients among this group developed steroid refractory acute GVHD. Infliximab group (n=31) had a higher proportion of patients with grade III-IV GVHD (69% VS 59%, p=0.18). ATG group (n=21) had a higher proportion of patients with stage 3-4 liver GVHD (28% VS 5%, p<0.01). Infliximab or ATG therapy was initiated after a median of 12 days (range, 2 to 85 days; 10 days for infliximab group VS 22 days for ATG group; p<0.01) of steroids for primary therapy for GVHD. Both overall response (PR+CR) were significantly higher in the infliximab group compared with the ATG group (54.8% VS 33.3%, p=0.015 ). In multivariate analysis, time from first-line therapy (days<10) was an independent predictor of response (HR, 3.91; 95%CI, 1.10-13.8; p=0.034), infliximab therapy was not significant, (HR, 1.30; 95%CI, 0.42-3.99; p=0.18). Median follow-up of surviving patients from the date of initiation of salvage treatment was 21.6 months (range, 5.5-57.9 months).Overall, median survival was 2 months after salvage treatment (95% CI, 1-3), with 25% of patients surviving at 12 months (95%CI, 11-20). Patients who achieved a CR have better survival rates. GVHD was the main cause of death (50%). When comparing survival according to salvage treatment, better OS with infliximab (33.9% VS 22.8, p=0.08) in univariate analysis was not confirmed in multivariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, grade IV GVHD at steroid refractory GVHD onset (HR,7.1; 95% CI, 1.29-38.7; P=0.021), and gut involvement with bleeding (HR, 7.65; 95% CI, 1.35-43.2; P=0.024) were significantly associated with worse survival. Conclusion We conclude that infliximab has more activity than ATG in the treatment of severe steroid-refractory GVHD, and earlier initiation of salvage therapy may give better response. But outcomes remain poor. New methods to prevent and treat GVHD are needed. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
