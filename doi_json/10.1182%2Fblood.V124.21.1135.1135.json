    "abstract_text": "Background: Late cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease is a well-established complication in patients undergoing HCT and extended surveillance and preemptive therapy in high-risk patients is recommended by international guidelines. The objectives of this study were to describe the incidence, clinical characteristics and outcome of, and risk factors for the development of late CMV disease in day 100 survivors of allogeneic HCT who did and did not undergo viral load-guided preemptive therapy based on a pre-defined risk algorithm. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed medical records of 1526 HCT patients (donor or recipients seropositive), who received their first allogeneic HCT at FHCRC between 2001 and 2011 and survived to day 100. PCR-based surveillance was recommended for patients who had CMV viremia or disease before day 100 or had GVHD that required systemic treatment. Preemptive therapy was recommended for CMV DNA levels of >1000 copies per mL of plasma. We evaluated all CMV disease events occurring between day 100 and 2 years. Patients were categorized by their recommended surveillance status and, among those who were in the surveillance category, adherence to the testing schedule was examined. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the risk of late CMV disease and overall mortality. Candidate variables included risk status for PCR surveillance, CMV reactivation (before day 100 and after day 100 [as time dependent variable]), steroid use (\u2265 1mg/kg/day) as well as other patient/donor and transplantation related factors; for mortality late CMV disease was also analyzed as a variable. Results: Among 1526 patients there were 118 cases of late CMV disease by 2 years (cumulative incidence 8% [95% CI- 7-9%]). The first manifestation of late CMV disease was pneumonia in 57 cases (48%), gastrointestinal disease (GI) in 54 cases (46%), and retinitis in 7 cases (6%). Fifteen percent of patients with late CMV disease (1% of cohort) had a subsequent event. Among first cases of late CMV disease 97 (82%) occurred between day 100 and 1 year and 21 (18%) occurred between 1 and 2 years after HCT. The median time to first late CMV disease was 192 days for pneumonia, 196 days for GI, and 230 days for retinitis. Extended CMV surveillance after day 100 was recommended for 1246 (82%) of patients. Late CMV disease occurred in 8.7% of patients for whom continued surveillance was recommended, compared to 2.9% of patients who were considered at low risk and were not advised to continue CMV testing. The median time to first late CMV disease event was 192 days post-transplant for the high risk group and 292 days for the low risk group. Among the 8 disease cases in patients in the low risk group, 4 cases (2 pneumonia, 2 GI) occurred in the first year and 4 (1 pneumonia, 3 GI) in the second year after HCT. In a multivariable Cox model steroid treatment after day 100 (HR=6.49; 95% CI 3.4-12.3, p <0.001), CMV reactivation after day 100 (HR=3.78; 95% CI 2.5-5.7, p <0.001), and CMV reactivation before day 100 (HR=2.07; 95% CI 1.3-3.4, p =0.003) were all strongly associated with the risk of late CMV disease. The development of CMV disease and acute GVHD (grade 3-4) before day 100 were not significantly associated with late CMV disease. Late CMV disease (HR=2.2; 95% CI 1.6-3, p< 0.001) and late CMV reactivation (HR=1.63; 95% CI 1.3-2, p <0.001) were associated with increased risk of death between day 100 and 2 years after HCT. An analysis of the adherence to PCR surveillance and viral load levels among breakthrough cases will be presented at the conference. Conclusions: Late CMV disease remains an important complication after HCT. Currently recommended risk stratification parameters for extended surveillance identify most patients at risk for late CMV disease, however, occasionally late CMV disease can occur in patients that were deemed at low risk at 3 months after HCT. Also, late CMV disease can occur beyond 1 year after HCT and disease recurrence is about 15%. Overall, both late CMV infection and disease continue to be independently associated with overall mortality in the preemptive therapy era. Refined strategies are needed to further reduce the late-occurring complications of CMV infection among HCT recipients.
