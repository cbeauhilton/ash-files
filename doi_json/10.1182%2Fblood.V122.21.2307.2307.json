    "abstract_text": "Introduction Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is a member of the group of sulfhydryl isomerase enzymes which catalyze the formation, reduction and exchange of disulfide bonds. We and others have shown that PDI has a role in integrin-mediated platelet adhesion and aggregation, and among its proposed targets are integrins \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 and \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 . There has been no clear evidence indicating whether disulfide bond exchange plays a role in the post-ligation phase of adhesion, which involves outside-in signaling. Objective We tested our hypothesis that free sulfhydryls and PDI play an essential role in the post-ligation phase of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 and \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 -dependent cell adhesion to fibrinogen. Methods Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cells were transfected with wild type (WT) \u03b1 IIb and either WT \u03b2 3 or \u03b2 3 mutated at specific cysteines, resulting in surface expression of both \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 and \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 . Single or double cysteine to serine mutations disrupting the Cys473-Cys503 and the Cys523-Cys544 disulfide bonds were generated. Evaluation of the expression and activity of WT or mutated integrins on the surface of BHK cells was performed by flow cytometry using P2 and PAC1 antibodies, respectively. Adhesion of BHK cells, expressing WT or mutated \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 , to fibrinogen-coated wells was studied in the presence or absence of bacitracin, a PDI inhibitor. Each experiment was performed with and without an \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 blocker (RO0655233-001). The adhered cells were stained and counted using light microscopy. Results Flow cytometry showed that BHK cells expressing the \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 mutants bound both P2 and PAC1 while WT \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 -transfected cells bound only P2, indicating that the mutated \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 receptors were constitutively active while WT \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 was inactive as previously shown. The adhesion of BHK cells to fibrinogen was dependent on \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 surface expression in both WT and mutants. Adhesion was reduced following treatment with the \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 blocker, suggesting that both \u03b2 3 integrins support binding to immobilized fibrinogen (p < 0.05 for WT, C473S, C523S/C544S; p=0.053 for C544S). Without blocking of \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 , only cells expressing WT \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 were inhibited by bacitracin (p=0.03, Figure 1A ). Combination of the \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 blocker and bacitracin, enabled a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of bacitracin on adhesion of cells expressing either WT \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 or mutants disrupting the Cys523-Cys544 bond (C544S, C523S/C544S and C523S; p < 0.05 for each; Figure 1B ). Statistical analysis failed to indicate a similar role for the Cys-473-Cys-503 bond (C473S and C503S; Figure 1B ).

The difference between the inhibitory effect of bacitracin on the mutants disrupting the Cys523-Cys544 bond and the mutants disrupting the Cys473-Cys503 bond suggests that the role of disulfide bond exchange in the post-ligation phase of adhesion may differ between different disulfide bonds. In the absence of the \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 blocker, bacitracin had no inhibitory effect on cells expressing the constitutively active mutants and the inhibitory effect of bacitracin on cells expressing the WT integrins was less prominent. Therefore, disulfide bond exchange mediated by PDI may have a pivotal role in the post-ligation phase of adhesion mediated by \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 receptor, while the adhesion to fibrinogen mediated by \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 integrin depends on PDI to a lesser extent.
