    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Despite cure rates in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) exceeding 90% in clinical trials, morbidity due to drug toxicities is high. Genetic polymorphisms can influence gene expression and activity, impacting pharmacokinetics and causing inter-individual variation in drug levels, which contributes to toxicity if levels are high or relapse if levels are low. We hypothesize that pharmacogenomic testing will identify patient specific variations in genes involved in metabolism of cytotoxic agents. This knowledge will allow clinicians to optimize therapy by providing pharmacogenomics based biomarkers related to increased toxicities. Data has shown that treatment interruptions and omissions due to toxicities affect outcomes and morbidities in children with cancer. Objective : To correlate pharmacogenomic biomarkers with toxicity phenotypes in children receiving therapy for ALL. Methods : This cross-sectional study involved subjects at a tertiary academic center (Fig. 1A). Subjects aged 1 year to 26 years with ALL treated after May 2012 were eligible. A total of 75 patients treated between 2012 and 2020 were included. Pharmacogenomic testing was performed on peripheral blood. Genomic DNA was tested for 118 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 55 genes for transport and metabolism of cytarabine, vincristine, methotrexate, dauno/doxorubicin, and mercaptopurine/thioguanine were analyzed using the Sequenom-based genotyping that uses MALDI-TOF based chemistry. SNPs were tested using logistic regression models for association with toxicities in additive, dominant, and recessive modes of inheritance. CTCAE v4.0 was used for grading all toxicities during the first 100 days of therapy. For endocrine (endo) and neurological (neuro) toxicities, 25 patients exhibited between grade 1-3 toxicities. For gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities, 25 patients exhibited between grade 2-3 toxicities. For hematological (heme) toxicities, 11 patients exhibited between grade 2-4 toxicities. Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated for each test and SNPs with association P-value 0, 0 or <0. Results: For a GI toxicity score derived from 3 SNPs (TYMS-rs151264360, FPGS-rs1544105, and GSTM5-rs3754446), patients with >0 score had 79% incidence of GI toxicity (N=67) as compared to 10% in patients with score of 0 and 8% in patients with score 0; no toxicity was observed in patients with neurotoxicity score of 0 (p=4.7E-08, Fig. 1E). None of the patients with a score of <0 experienced endo toxicity. Discussion: We identified germline SNPs predictive of toxicity phenotypes in a cohort of 75 subjects with ALL. The results of our multivariable SNP combination analysis suggest susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced toxicities is likely multigenic in nature. Instead of a single SNP approach, identification of combinations of mutations in drug pathways increases the robustness of predicting a patient's response to chemotherapy. Our results provide promising SNP models that can help establish clinically relevant biomarkers allowing for individualization of cancer therapy to optimize treatment for each patient.
