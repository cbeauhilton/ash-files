    "abstract_text": "Objective Previous small-scale studies suggest that maternal smoking lowers neonatal body iron. Our objective was to study and compare the relationship between maternal and infants\u2019 body iron in smokers and non-smokers in a large matched-pair cohort. Method This was a prospective cohort study involving 144 mothers \u2013 72 smokers and 72 non-smokers and their respective infants. Samples were obtained from maternal blood and infants\u2019 cord blood at delivery for serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) and ferritin levels. Serum TfR and ferritin levels were measured by RAMCO ELISA and RIA assays. The total body iron (TBI) was calculated using the sTfR/ferritin ratio. Results Maternal total body iron and smoking status Women who smoked had lower sTfR, higher ferritin and higher body iron compared to nonsmoking women. Infant\u2019s total body iron, measurements at birth and smoking status In contrast to their respective mothers, we found a small but statistically significant negative correlation between smoking and infants\u2019 total body iron. The number of PPD smoked was negatively correlated with infants\u2019 ferritin and total body iron. The number of days smoked during pregnancy was also negatively correlated with infants\u2019 ferritin and total body iron and positively correlated with infants' sTfR. Birth weight was lower in babies of smokers compared to nonsmokers (mean /- SD =3270 +/-475 vs. 3393 g +/- 475 g, p=0.03). Correlation studies revealed that birth weight in infants of smokers was negatively correlated with PPD smoked and number of days smoked. Birth length in the same infants was also negatively correlated with PPD smoked and number of days smoked. Conclusion Mothers who smoked during pregnancy had higher iron stores but their newborn infants had lower iron stores than those of non-smoking mothers. There may be a negative dose-dependent response between fetal smoke exposure and infant iron stores. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.
