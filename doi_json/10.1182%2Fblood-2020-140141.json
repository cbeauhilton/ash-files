    "abstract_text": "Background : Selinexor (SEL) is a novel, first-in-class oral selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) which blocks XPO1, forcing the nuclear retention and activation of tumor suppressor proteins, ultimately causing cell death in cancer cells. SEL 80 mg and dexamethasone (dex) 20 mg, both twice weekly (BIW), received accelerated approval from the FDA for patients (pts) with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). SEL continues to be evaluated in earlier lines of therapy with once weekly administration and in combination regimens. The SVd regimen with once weekly (QW) oral SEL (100 mg), dexamethasone (dex) and QW bortezomib (BOR) had significantly increased progression free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) with significantly reduced peripheral neuropathy as compared to standard BIW BOR/dex (Vd) in the phase III BOSTON study. The combination of lenalidomide (LEN) and dex (Rd) is an approved regimen in RRMM and newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) with an ORR of 70-76% in RRMM but a low complete response rate. SEL showed synergistic antitumor activity with LEN in a MM xenograft model. Therefore, we hypothesized that the all oral combination of weekly SEL with standard Rd (i.e., SRd) could improve the efficacy compared with Rd in pts with RRMM and NDMM with acceptable toxicity profile. Methods: STOMP is a phase 1b/2 multicenter, open-label, clinical trial with the goals of determining the maximum tolerated dose, the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), efficacy and safety of SRd in pts with RRMM or NDMM. For RRMM, SEL was dose escalated in two regimens QW (starting at SEL 80 mg) or BIW (starting at 60 mg), LEN 25 mg PO daily and DEX 20 mg BIW or 40 mg QW. Results: As of June 1, 2020, 24 pts (13 male, 11 female) with RRMM were enrolled. The median age was 67 years (range, 49-84) and the median number of prior lines of therapy was 1.5 (range, 1 - 8). In the 60 mg BIW dosing, 4 pts experienced dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) out of 5 pts dosed (2 thrombocytopenia, 1 anorexia, 1 >25% missed dose due to unrelated QT interval prolongation). In the 80 mg QW dosing, 2 pts experienced DLTs out of 6 pts (both grade 4 thrombocytopenia). In the 60 mg QW dosing, no DLTs were observed. Based on these data, the RP2D of SRd was determined to be: SEL 60 mg QW, LEN 25 mg QD and DEX 40 mg QW. Common treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) (All Grades, \u22653) were thrombocytopenia (71%, 63%), neutropenia (63%, 63%), nausea (58%, 4%), fatigue (54%, 17%), decreased appetite (50%, 8%), and weight loss (42%, 8%). Amongst the 20 pts with RRMM where efficacy was evaluable, previously treated/documented refractory rates were: bortezomib (100%, 45%), LEN (40%, 25%), daratumumab (20%, 20%), and pomalidomide (20%, 20%). Amongst the LEN na\u00efve pts (n=12), the ORR was 92% including 1 stringent complete response [sCR], 4 very good partial responses [VGPR] and 6 partial responses [PR, 2 unconfirmed]). PFS in LEN na\u00efve pts has not been reached with a median follow-up period of 7.8 months. In the pts with prior LEN treatment (n=8), the ORR was 13%. Based on the high levels of activity of SRd in LEN na\u00efve pts, 8 pts (4 males and 4 females) with NDMM were enrolled at the RP2D. The median age was 74 (range: 51-86) years. No DLTs were observed in 5 DLT evaluable pts. Common TRAEs (All Grades, \u22653) were thrombocytopenia (63%, 38%), neutropenia (75%, 75%), fatigue (63%, 50%), nausea (50%, 0%), weight loss (63%, 0%), and decreased appetite (13%, 13%). All 7 efficacy evaluable pts achieved a response, an ORR of 100%, including 1 CR, 4 VGPR, and 2 PR. With a median follow-up of 10.2 months, median PFS has not been reached. Out of these 7 pts, three pts withdrew consent to transit to successful autologous stem cell collection and transplantation. Conclusions: The all oral combination of SRd with once weekly SEL 60 mg, LEN 25 mg QD and DEX 40 mg QW was established as the RP2D for pts with RRMM or NDMM. The safety profile was similar in both settings. All TRAEs were manageable with adequate supportive care and/or dose modification. The all oral combination of SRd has demonstrated ORR of 92% in pts with LEN na\u00efve RRMM and ORR of 100% in pts with NDMM, warranting further investigation of SRd with or without additional anti-MM agents for the treatment of pts with NDMM.
