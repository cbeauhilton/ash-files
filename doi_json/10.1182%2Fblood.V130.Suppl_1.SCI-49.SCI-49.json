    "abstract_text": "We use cell culture-based high-throughput methods to interrogate human memory B cell and plasma cell repertoires and to isolate antibodies selected on the basis of their neutralizing potency and breadth. Relevant examples are antibodies that neutralize all influenza A viruses or even four paramyxoviruses. By targeting conserved structures, these broadly neutralizing antibodies are less prone to select escape mutants and are promising candidates for prophylaxis and therapy of infections, as well as tools for vaccine design. The value of a target-agnostic approach to vaccine design is illustrated by our discovery of extremely potent antibodies that neutralize human cytomegalovirus, which led to the identification of their viral ligand, a pentameric complex that was then produced and tested as an effective vaccine. By reconstructing the genealogy trees of specific B cell clones, we investigate the role of somatic mutations in affinity maturation and in generation of antibody variants with broader or different specificity. Somatic mutations can also generate autoantibodies, as found in patients with pemphigus and autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Recently, while searching for antibodies that broadly react with malaria variant antigens, we discovered a new mechanism of antibody diversification, which relies on templated insertions of genomic DNA sequences into immunoglobulin genes, followed by somatic mutations.
