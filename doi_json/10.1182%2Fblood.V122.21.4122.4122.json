    "abstract_text": "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is a hematological malignancy of mature B cells and constitutes the most common leukemia in adults. It is characterized by a progressive accumulation of clonal B cells, which coexpress CD19, CD23 and CD5. The clinical course of CLL can be predicted by serveral prognostic markers like CD38, ZAP70 and cytogenetic abnormalities. While the treatment of CLL has significantly improved during recent years, it remains an essentially incurable disease and the molecular events that lead to its development are still largely elusive. NFAT is a family of highly phosphorylated transcription factors residing in the cytoplasm of resting cells. Upon dephosphorylation NFAT proteins translocate to the nucleus where they orchestrate developmental and activation programs in diverse cell types. NFAT is inactivated by a network of several kinases. Several recent studies have demonstrated that Ca 2+ /NFAT signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of a wide array of different tumor types including pancreatic adenocarcinoma, breast cancer and Non Hodgkin\u00b4s lymphoma. In this study we investigated the significance of the Ca 2+ /NFAT signaling pathway in B-CLL. For this purpose, we analyzed CLL cell lines (MEC-1, JVM-3) as well as primary blood samples from patients with CLL (n=30). The analyzed patient population exhibited a representative distribution of age, sex, Binet stage, WBC count, cytogenetics and IGVH mutational status. We detected a profound overexpression of NFAT2 mRNA as well as NFAT2 protein in all CLL samples. Using qRT-PCR we found that CD19 + CD5 + CLL cells exhibited an at least three fold overexpression of NFAT2 as compared to CD19 + B cells isolated from healthy donors. In one case, NFAT2 expression in CLL cells was 200 times higher than in the corresponding controls. This profound overexpression of NFAT2 in CLL cells could be confirmed on the protein level using Western Blotting and Immunocytochemistry. We could further demonstrate that even under resting conditions significant amounts of NFAT2 protein had translocated to the nucleus in CLL cells, whereas virtually all NFAT2 was in the cytoplasm in healthy B cells. NFAT2 nuclear translocation could be inhibited using pretreatment with Cyclosporin A demonstrating that this process was still calcineurin-dependent in CLL cells. We could further show that nuclear NFAT2 in CLL cells was able to bind DNA using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). To assess the transcriptional activity of NFAT2 in human CLL we determined the expression of the apoptosis regulators OX40L, osteopontin and PD-L2, which we previously identified as NFAT2 target genes in a gene expression analysis with CD19 + CD5 + CLL cells from TCL1 transgenic mice with intact NFAT2 and NFAT2 deletion, respectively. Interestingly, qRT-PCR revealed a tremendous reduction of all three target genes in the analyzed CLL samples as compared to control B cells from healthy donors. This is particularly remarkable, since in the TCL1 mouse model we observed a similar reduction of the expression of these genes in CLL cells with NFAT2 ablation. In summary, these results provide strong evidence that the Ca 2+ /NFAT signaling axis is constitutively activated in CD19 + CD5 + CLL cells. Our data suggest that the profound overexpression of NFAT2 in CLL cells leads to its targeting to aberrant genetic loci different from its phsiological target genes resulting in a consecutive knock out phenotype with respect to the expression of the apoptosis regulators OX40, osteopontin and PD-L2 in CLL. Further investigation is therefore warranted to decipher the therapeutic potential of modulating the Ca 2+ /Calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway in this disease.
