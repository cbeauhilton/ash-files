    "abstract_text": "The CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family of proteins bind DNA via their C-terminal basic region \u2013 leucine zipper (BR-LZ or bZIP) domains and activate transcription via N-terminal trans-activation domains. We previously demonstrated that C/EBP\u03b1 inhibits apoptosis when the immature hematopoietic Ba/F3 cell line is withdrawn from IL-3 and that a C/EBP\u03b1 BR mutant that does not bind NF-\u03baB p50 but retains the ability to bind NF-\u03baB p65 is inactive. We have now sought to extend these findings to C/EBP\u03b2. We first created two point mutations in C/EBP\u03b2, R240G and \u0394K253. The C/EBP\u03b2(R240G) is analogous to the C/EBP\u03b1(R300G) BR variant that does not bind NF-\u03baB p50 or inhibit apoptosis, and C/EBP\u03b2(\u0394K253) is analogous to the C/EBP\u03b1(\u0394K313) LZ variant that does not bind DNA but retains the ability to interact with NF-\u03baB p50 and inhibit apoptosis. In co-ip experiments using transiently transfected 293T extracts, both C/EBP\u03b2 and C/EBP\u03b2(\u0394K253) interacted with NF-\u03baB p50, whereas C/EBP\u03b2(R240G) did not, as predicted. In contrast, all three isoforms bound NF-\u03baB p65. And in gel shift assay, C/EBP\u03b2 bound a consensus C/EBP site, whereas neither C/EBP\u03b2(R240G) nor C/EBP\u03b2(\u0394K253) bound DNA, again as expected. Ba/F3 cell lines were then generated stably expressing C/EBP\u03b2-ER, C/EBP(R240G)-ER, or C/EBP\u03b2(\u0394K253)-ER proteins, via transduction with pBabePuro retroviral vectors and puromycin selection of pooled populations. Western blot analysis confirmed similar expression of each transgene. Ba/F3 lines were removed from IL-3 and cultured with or without estradiol, to activate the ER fusion proteins. Remarkably, both CEBP\u03b2-ER and C/EBP\u03b2(\u0394K253)-ER prolonged survival of the cells during the first 48 hrs after IL-3 withdrawal, similar to the activity of C/EBP\u03b1-ER, whereas C/EBP\u03b2(R240G)-ER was ineffective. Current efforts focus on identifying genetic targets of C/EBP\u03b2:NF-\u03baB p50 cooperation relevant to the observed inhibition of apoptosis, on assessing activities of C/EBP\u03b2 and it variants in normal hematopoietic cells isolated from adult marrow, and on determining the activities of the long and short (LAP and LIP) C/EBP\u03b2 translational isoforms. Overall, the finding that C/EBP\u03b2 inhibits apoptosis in cooperation with NF-\u03baB p50 is significant due to the expression of both C/EBP\u03b2 and activated NF-\u03baB in several human lymphoma subsets and in solid tumors such as breast cancer. Targeting this interaction with small molecules may provide a novel therapeutic approach for these malignancies."
