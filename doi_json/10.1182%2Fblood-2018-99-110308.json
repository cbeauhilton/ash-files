    "abstract_text": "Introduction The short half-life of standard factor VIII (FVIII) products means that frequent injections (3 to 4 times/week) are needed for effective prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A. N8-GP (turoctocog alfa pegol), an extended half-life glycoPEGylated recombinant FVIII developed for the prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds in patients with hemophilia A, allows for less frequent dosing. Bleed frequency is an important outcome measure in hemophilia, particularly when choosing a dosing regimen that best suits a broad range of patients. Objectives To summarize annualized bleeding rate (ABR) data from 2 clinical trials of N8-GP in patients with severe hemophilia A. Methods Patients with severe hemophilia A (FVIII <1%) were enrolled into the pathfinder comprehensive clinical trial program: pathfinder 2 main phase Adults/adolescents \u226512 years, N8-GP 50 IU/kg every 4 days (Q4D) or 20-75 IU/kg on demand pathfinder 2 extension phase Adults/adolescents \u226512 years, randomized to receive N8-GP 50 IU/kg Q4D or 75 IU/kg once weekly (Q7D) Patients with \u22642 bleeds in the last 6 months were eligible for randomization pathfinder 5 main phase Children <12 years, N8-GP 60 IU/kg (50-75 IU/kg) twice weekly. ABR was analyzed using a Poisson-regression model on the number of bleeds per patient, allowing for over-dispersion and using log-planned observation duration as an offset to allow for different treatment durations, with age cohort as a factor for pathfinder 5. Median and estimated Poisson mean ABR data from the 2 trials were summarized for overall, spontaneous, traumatic, joint, and muscle bleeds. Results For adults/adolescents receiving N8-GP 50 IU/kg Q4D (pathfinder 2 main phase) and those randomized to receive 50 IU/kg Q4D or 75 IU/kg Q7D (pathfinder 2 extension), median overall ABRs were 1.18, 0.00, and 0.00, respectively (Table). Corresponding median ABRs were: For spontaneous bleeds 0.00, 0.00, and 0.00 For traumatic bleeds 0.00, 0.00, and 0.00 For joint bleeds 0.85, 0.00, and 0.00 For muscle bleeds 0.00, 0.00, and 0.00. For children (aged 0-11 years) receiving 60 IU/kg twice weekly (pathfinder 5), median overall, spontaneous, traumatic, joint, and muscle ABRs were 1.95, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, and 0.00, respectively. Poisson estimated mean ABR data for all bleed types are also shown in the Table. Conclusion N8-GP provides effective prophylactic protection in adult/adolescent and pediatric patients with severe hemophilia A, as demonstrated by low ABRs in phase 3 clinical trials. For patients of all ages, N8-GP enables simplicity in the choice of prophylaxis dose and dosing frequency with no need for pharmacokinetic-tailored dosing.
