    "abstract_text": "\u03b1M\u03b22 integrin receptors on myeloid cells mediate the adhesion or uptake of diverse ligands, and particular sequences on this integrin\u2019s alpha subunit are responsible for recognition specificity. Inhibition of neutrophil adhesion to platelet monolayers by \u03b1M-derived peptides has implicated an \u03b1M sequence (I-domain) that also binds iC3b, fibrinogen, ICAM-1 and other ligands. However, \u03b1M\u03b22 also recognizes \u03b2N-acetylglucosamine (\u03b2GlcNAc) residues on the platelet von Willebrand factor receptor (GPIb\u03b1) that are clustered after cooling, suggesting that the \u03b1M lectin domain is important for this recognition. The phagocytosis of chilled platelets can be reconstituted when CHO cells are transfected with \u03b1M\u03b22. Removal of the N-T portion of GPIb\u03b1, containing the exposed \u03b2GlcNAc residues, from the chilled platelet surface using the snake venom mocarhagin inhibits this phagocytosis, as does the addition of 1 mM \u03b2-methyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Replacement of the I domain, or the lectin domain of the \u03b1M-chain with the corresponding domain from the \u03b1x-chain (p150), reveals that the activity of the \u03b1M\u03b22 integrin toward chilled platelets resides within the lectin-domain, and does not require the I domain. Other evidences for this conclusion include: (1) Sf9 cells expressing \u03b1M lectin domain but not \u03b22 bind 3-4 x more chilled platelets than control cells; \u03b2GlcNAc inhibits this binding. (2) Soluble recombinant \u03b1M lectin domain inhibits the phagocytosis of chilled platelets by \u03b1M\u03b22-expressing THP-1 cells while I-domain substrates (fibrinogen or LPM19c), recombinant I-domain protein, or a synthetic peptide that inhibits neutrophil adhesion to platelet monolayers, are without inhibitory effect. We conclude that chilled platelets are removed from blood by an interaction between \u03b2GlcNAc residues on clustered GPIb\u03b1 and the lectin domain of \u03b1M-chain of the \u03b1M\u03b22 integrin. Since the phagocytosis and clearance of chilled platelets by hepatic macrophages has precluded refrigeration of platelets procured for transfusion, a more precise molecular definition of the recognition mechanism could inform strategies for its inhibition, thereby accommodating cold platelet storage.",
