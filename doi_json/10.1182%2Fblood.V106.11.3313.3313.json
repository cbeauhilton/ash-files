    "abstract_text": "Human T cell development occurs in two waves of development and proliferation: first, early T cells expressing the TCRb chain but not the \u03b1-chain are selected for functional TCR\u03b2 protein independent of HLA recognition, a process called \u03b2-selection; second, thymocytes expressing both the \u03b1- and \u03b2-TCR are selected for intermediate affinity for self-MHC/ self-peptide complex. This latter process is referred to as positive selection. We sought to determine whether the peripheral TCRV\u03b2 frequencies in the nai\u0308ve T cell repertoire start off at a fixed rank order with minimal skewing as would be expected from a predominantly \u03b2-selected repertoire. A total of 22 TCRV\u03b2 proteins was quantitated by flow cytometry in a group of 20 unselected umbilical cord blood (UCB) samples (a kind gift from Dr. P. Rubinstein, NY Blood Center, NY), consisting of >80% nai\u0308ve T cells as defined by CD27+CD45RA+ staining in CD4+ and CD8+ cells. A common rank order of TCRV\u03b2 protein frequencies was found in both CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets (figure 1). Median TCRV\u03b2 frequencies in CD4 and in CD8 cells of UCB were statistically not significantly different from the frequencies in adult donor CD4 and CD8 cells (Wilcoxon signed rank test; p > 0.2). Furthermore, the percentages of CD4 cells expressing a particular V\u03b2 correlated significantly in CD8 cells (figure 2) with some V\u03b2 proteins being predominantly expressed by either CD4 (V\u03b22, V\u03b25.1) or CD8 (V\u03b214, V\u03b27) cells. Our data therefore conform to the prediction that the TCRV\u03b2 frequencies are dominantly shaped by \u03b2-selection, and not by interactions of the \u03b1\u03b2TCR/ co-receptor with MHC/ antigen complexes during thymic selection.
