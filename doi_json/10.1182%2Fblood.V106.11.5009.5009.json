    "abstract_text": "A 53 year old man with Rai stage IV CLL was being treated with R-HyperCVAD when he presented between cycles with fatigue, lethargy and pancytopenia. Clinical examination revealed diffuse adenopathy and splenomegaly. Serum calcium was 13.6 mg/dl, phosphorus level was 2.7 mg/dl, and alkaline phosphatase was 54 U/L. PTH was 4 Units/L (10\u201365), PTHrP < 0.2 pmole/L (0\u20131.9), 1\u201325 (OH) Vitamin D < 10pgm/ml (22\u201367). Quantitative immunglobulins: IgA 10 mg/dl, IgG 252 mg/dl, IgM 50 mg/dl. Immunofixation revealed a faint IgG lambda paraprotein. There were no lytic lesions on skeletal survey. Bone marrow biopsy revealed focal large cell transformation (Richter\u2019s syndrome). Cytogenetics revealed 3 metaphases with complex cytogenetic abnormalities, indicating clonal evolution. The hypercalcemia resolved with appropriate therapy, but despite subsequent treatment with CAMPATH, he died 2 weeks after diagnosis. A review of reported patients with CLL and hypercalcemia in the literature was performed from 1980 onwards using MEDLINE and PubMed; only those cases in which clinical aspects, biochemistry, PTH levels, imaging studies and concurrent pathology (if obtained) were documented, are summarized in this analysis (n=13). Rai stage: I n=1, II n=4, III n=3, IV n=5. Immunoreactive PTH levels were low or normal in 100% of patients. In 5 cases in which it was measured, 1\u201325 (OH) Vitamin D levels were not elevated. PTHrP was normal in 2 cases and elevated in 1. In nine patients, multiple lytic bone lesions were present on skeletal radiology. Two patients had osteopenia without lytic lesions. Two had no lytic lesions. Six of ten patients had evidence of transfomation on lymph node and/or bone marrow biopsy performed at the time of evaluation for hypercalcemia. Prognosis was poor (range 0.5\u201312 months) with only one patient surviving post allo-transplant. In conclusion, hypercalcemia in CLL is rare. Osteolytic lesions are present in the majority of cases. PTH levels are low, and thus this hormone is not mediating the hypercalcemia. The evidence is also against a role of elevated Vitamin D. Histological transformation is seen in half of the cases. Survival is poor after diagnosis of hypercalcemia. The mechanisms(s) of the osteolysis and hypercalcemia remain to be defined."
