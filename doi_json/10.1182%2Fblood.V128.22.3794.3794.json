    "abstract_text": "Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, collectively referred to as venous thromboembolism (VTE), are the third leading cause of cardiovascular death in the United States. Genetic factors account for 50-60% of VTE risk and a recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies confirmed that common variants in F5 , ABO , and seven other loci are associated with VTE. Rare mutations in the anticoagulant genes PROC , PROS1 and SERPINC1 have been linked to VTE in family studies. In order to identify new genetic variants altering the risk for VTE, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in 373 unrelated individuals of European ancestry with unprovoked VTE and compared results to a previously sequenced control cohort of 5784 unrelated Europeans. To avoid variant calling bias, only SNVs from exons with >10X coverage and less than 5% difference in coverage between cases and controls were included, removing 11,813 of 188,689 intervals. We used an emerging framework for a \"collapsing\" analysis on genes, defining qualifying variants on the basis of annotation and minor allele frequency <0.05%, and assumed a dominant model of inheritance. Tests were performed via a Fisher's exact test for a total of 11,585 CCDS genes. Strikingly, ranked by p-value, the top 4 genes were PROS1 (P= 2.01E-09, OR 11.8), STAB2 (P=2.70E-7, OR 3.37), PROC (P=3.24E-05, OR 11.0) and SERPINC1 (P=1.10E-04, OR 8.5). We detected 29 qualifying variants in 373 cases and 106 qualifying variants in 5784 controls in STAB2 . This gene encodes Stabilin-2, which is a transmembrane glycoprotein scavenger receptor. Common variants at ABO are associated with VTE and are also known to regulate von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and coagulation Factor VIII (F8) plasma levels. Common variants in STAB2 are also associated with VWF/F8 levels in a large GWAS and with VTE risk in a smaller candidate gene study, suggesting that haploinsufficiency for Stabilin-2 may increase VTE risk through elevated levels of VWF/F8. Although replication and functional testing of these findings is warranted, this study demonstrates the utility of collapsing analyses using WES data to identify multiple loci harboring an excess of rare variants in individuals with a common complex disease trait.
