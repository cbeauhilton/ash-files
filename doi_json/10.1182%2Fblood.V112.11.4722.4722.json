    "abstract_text": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 19\u201325 nucleotide long RNA molecules derived from precursor genes that inhibit the expression of target genes by binding to their 3\u2032 UTR region. Expression of miRNAs is often tissue specific and miRNA profiling has shown specific miRNA expression patterns in both B-cell development and lymphomagenesis. Hodgkin lymphoma is derived from pre-apoptotic germinal center B-cells, although a general loss of B cell phenotype is noted. Using quantitative RT-PCR and miRNA microarray, we determined the miRNA profile of HL and compared this with the profile of a panel of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). The two methods showed a very good correlation for the expression levels of the individual miRNAs. Using a large panel of cell lines, we confirmed differential expression between HL and other B-cell lymphoma derived cell lines for 27 miRNAs. The HL specific miRNAs included miR-155, miR-21 and miR-106b seed family members miR-17-5p, miR-20a, miR-93, miR-106a and miR- 106b. Next, we performed target gene validation of predicted target genes for miR-17-5p, which is highly expressed in HL. Using luciferase reporter assays with stabilized anti-sense miR17-5p oligonucleotides, we showed that GPR137B , RAB12 and RBJ are likely miR-17-5p target genes in two different HL cell lines. Previous publications indicated that miR-106b seed family members negatively regulate the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21/CIP1) resulting in cell cycle arrest at G1. Consistent with these findings, we show that the miR-106b family members are highly expressed in L428, whereas p21 is not. However, inhibition of the miR-106b seed family members in L428 does not result in elevated p21 protein expression. Furthermore, there is no cell cycle arrest, growth reduction or increase in cell death and apoptosis after inhibition of the miR-106b seed family members. Thus, we conclude that blocking of the miR-106b seed family members does not necessarily lead to indiction of p21 protein. This suggests an additional regulatory layer of p21 expression in L428 cells."
