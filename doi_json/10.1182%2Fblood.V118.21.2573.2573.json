    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2573 Introduction: Polyethylene glycol conjugated L-asparaginase (PEG-ASNase) is used in varying doses between 1000\u20132500 U/m 2 in the therapy of ALL and associated with a wide variation in pharmacokinetics. UKALL 2003 used intramuscular PEG-ASNase at 1000 U/m 2 . Patients & Methods: Patients enrolled in the UKALL 2003 trial (ISRCTN: 07355119), were consented for trough asparaginase activity analysis during therapy. National Cancer Institute (NCI) standard risk (SR) patients with rapid early response and non-high risk (HR) cytogenetics (Lancet Oncol. 2010;11:429) received a 3 drug induction (Dexamethasone, Vincristine & PEG-ASNase). All other patients received additional Daunorubicin. PEG-ASNase was given on days 4 and 18 of induction, and at least once post induction. Trough plasma asparaginase activity was measured by the indooxine method (Anal. Biochem. 2002;309:117). The lower limit of assay detection was 34 U/L. Adequate asparaginase activity was defined as a trough level of > 100 U/L. IgG and IgM antibodies to PEG-ASNase and native asparaginase were measured by indirect ELISA. Asparaginase activity was correlated with defined risk factors, minimal residual disease (MRD) at day 28 of induction and development of anti-asparaginase antibodies using the chi-squared test. Results: Between July 2008 to July 2011, 482 patients aged 1\u201325 years from 27 centres were recruited. Numbers of samples assayed in induction were 335 & 371 after first and second doses respectively. Overall, 86% (n=606/706) of samples had adequate activity during induction time points. There was > 10 fold variation in activity levels ( Figure 1 ). Three hundred and nine out of 706 samples had activity > 3 times the therapeutic threshold, while 51/100 samples with inadequate activity had no detectable drug levels (median: below detection limit, range: < 34\u201399 U/L). Thus, increasing the dose of PEG-ASNase in induction is unlikely to benefit patients with inadequate activity. Compared to SR patients, NCI HR patients had a higher incidence of inadequate asparaginase activity in induction (p=0.002). Inadequate asparaginase activity correlated with high MRD (\u2265 10 \u22124 ) in SR patients (p=0.045), especially those with good risk cytogenetics (p=0.012), and in particular the high hyperdiploid subgroup (p=0.03). Inadequate asparaginase activity during induction did not correlate with MRD in HR patients (p=0.699), possibly because these patients received in addition Daunorubicin ( Table 1 ).

Antibodies were detected in 18 of 81 patients tested. All had anti-PEG and 7 in addition also had anti-asparaginase antibodies. While all antibody positive patients had inadequate asparaginase activity at one time point, 17 had adequate activity prior to antibody detection, suggesting immune-mediated drug inactivation at re-exposure. Antibodies were not detected in 14/15 patients who had inadequate activity at first exposure, so the mechanism here remains unclear. View large View Large The reported incidence of asparaginase toxicity in this study was 6.6% (n=32/482). This included hypersensitivity (n=17/482) that was almost exclusively seen in HR patients (n=16/17), thrombosis (n=10/482) and pancreatitis (n=5/482). Conclusions: Intramuscular PEG-ASNase given fortnightly at 1000 U/m 2 during induction provides adequate asparaginase activity in 86% of patients. Monitoring asparaginase activity may benefit patients who receive 3 drug induction and improve the resolution of the current prognostic classification. Disclosures: Off Label Use: PEG-asparaginase.
