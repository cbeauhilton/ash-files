    "abstract_text": "Prion removal evaluation of plasma processing procedures is one important basis to assess the margin of safety of plasma protein therapeutics. Currently, in these evaluation studies to assess the removal capacity of selected manufacturing steps for human prions mainly prions derived from scrapie-infected hamsters or mice are used in spiking studies. In order to test the validity of hamster prions instead of different human prion strains as spiking reagents, we compared the partitioning of these prion preparations at two purification steps common to the manufacturing of several human plasma-derived therapeutic proteins at ZLB Behring. The glycine precipitation (inherent in the manufacture of e.g., vWF/Factor VIII) and the 25% ethanol precipitation step (inherent in the manufacture of e.g., alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor and albumin) were down scaled to mimic the production process. A microsomal membrane preparation as well as purified full-length pathogenic prion (PrP Sc ; without membrane association) prepared (a) from hamster brains infected with the model scrapie strain Sc237, (b) from brains of transgenic mice infected with human sporadic CJD prions, and (c) from the brain of a patient who died of vCJD were used for spiking experiments. The different prion preparations were spiked to the starting material of the manufacturing steps studied and the manufacturing step was performed in a dedicated laboratory. The amount of PrP Sc in all fractions was determined quantitatively utilizing an ELISA-formatted Conformation Dependent Immunoassay [ Safar et al., Nat Med  1998 ; 4  1157 \u20131165 ]. The 25% ethanol precipitation removed very effectively all prion preparations equally regardless of their origin (reduction factor \u2265 3 log 10 ). The glycine precipitation removed the microsomal as well as the purified prion preparations from all species equally whereby prions of the purified prion preparation were removed to a considerably higher degree than the membrane preparation (reduction factor \u2265 3 log 10 vs. 1.6 to 1.8 log 10 ). In parallel, prion infectivity of each sample is currently tested in animal bioassays involving transgenic mice susceptible for the tested prion strain. It can be concluded, up to now based on immunological data, that spiked hamster prions are a reliable model to confirm the safety of human plasma-derived products also for human derived prions.",
