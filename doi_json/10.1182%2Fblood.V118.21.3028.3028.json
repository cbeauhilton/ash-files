    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3028 Objective: Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used as prophylactic for GvHD. We retrospectively evaluated all CBT, to determine if there is any correlation between transplant outcomes and short course MTX prophylaxis. Patients & Method: Between January 1995 and January 2011, 142 CBT were performed at CMH for the treatment of malignant or non-malignant conditions on IRB approved protocols. Cord blood units were processed as described by Rubenstein et al. GvHD prophylaxis was either Methotrexate (MTX) with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine A (CSA) in 91patients; or non MTX regimens with/without ATG and CSA, in 51 patients. Statistical analysis for group and sub groups were done using Fisher's exact and log-rank tests, column statistics and unpaired t test. Significance was determined at the p-value of 0.05. Median \u00b1 SEM were also calculated and all have a confidence interval at 95%. There were 64 female and 78 male recipients; with 76 female and 65 male CBT units. Median age and weight at transplant were 3.7 yrs (0.1 \u2013 20.6) and 20.1 kg (3.0- 73). Degree of HLA matching was 6/6 (n= 15), 5/6 (n= 35), 4/6 (n= 83), 3/6 (n= 8). 8 cord blood units were from related donors (MR), 134 were from unrelated donors (MUD). 58 patients (41%) had ABO mismatch. HLA matching, ABO group and donor sex was not available for 1 patient-donor pair. The median cell dose was 0.90 \u00d7 10 8 /kg TNC, 0.79 \u00d7 10 8 /kg MNC and 1.14x 10 6 /kg CD34+ cells, (0.09\u2013 4.27; 0.08\u2013 3.84; 0.02\u2013 8.7 respectively). Malignant diagnoses (n= 95) (ALL (n= 47), AML (n= 29), MDS (n= 8), other (n= 11)); non-malignant (n= 47) (x-linked diseases (n= 21), Anemias (n= 9), Hemophagocytosis (n= 6), Osteopetrosis (n= 5), other (n= 6)). 130 patients (92%) received ablative regimens of fTBI + VP, Cy, TT or Bu, Cy + VP or TT, Cy + FLUD; 12 patients (8%) received non-ablative regimens of VP, Cy, or FLUD + Bu, Cy. Results: An ANC of >500 cells/\u03bcL was achieved in 78% of patients at 23 days (14\u2013 60); 75% achieved PLT count of >20, 000 at 43 days (14\u2013 105); and 65% achieved >95% donor cell chimerism at median of 28 days (13\u2013 169). 32 patients (22.5%) died within day +100 from TRM. 17 patients (18%) had relapse at median of 153 days (34\u2013 720). Acute GvHD was seen in 45.8% patients and 5.6% developed chronic GvHD. EFS at 1, 3 and 5 yr was 52%, 50% and 50% respectively, with 1, 3 and 5 yr OS of 63%, 60% and 60%. 62 patients are survivors. Median follow up was for 3 yrs (0.1- 16.4 yr). Outcomes for the MTX and non-MTX groups were as in Table 1 . Table 1  . Whole group, n= 142 . MTX, n= 91 . Non-MTX, n= 51 . p-value .

Patients in the MTX group took longer to ANC engraftment. There was no other statistical significance between the MTX and non-MTX groups with respect to TRM, Engraftment, GvHD, OS or EFS. In conclusion, short course MTX prophylaxis does not influence transplant outcomes in pediatric CBT for malignant or non-malignant conditions.
