    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5165 Background: Progressive anaemia is highly prevalent amongst many malignant diseases leading to RBC transfusion-dependency. Therefore transfusion-related iron overload (IOL) is common in these patients (pts) and can result in multiple organ failure. Iron chelation therapy prevents organ failure, reduces the risk of infections and can improve hematopoesis in some diseases. The once-daily oral iron chelator deferasirox has been shown to reduce iron overload in pts with various transfusion-dependent anaemias assessed by serum ferritin (SF). Despite extensive knowledge of iron chelation in MDS or beta-thalassemia pts, data in pts with other anaemias is limited. Here, we present data from a subgroup of transfusion-related IOL pts that were included two non-interventional studies (EXTEND, EXJANGE) performed in Germany and who suffered from diseases other than MDS or beta thalassemia. Methods: 130 pts with various malignant diseases such as myeloproliferative disorders (43 pts, including 31 pts particular specified as myelofibrosis), acute myeloid leukaemia (14 pts), sickle cell anaemia (6 pts), aplastic anaemia (11), congenital aplastic anaemia (5) or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (6 pts) were treated with deferasirox in the daily-routine setting of office-based physicians and included in either the EXTEND or EXJANGE study. Patient with MDS or beta-thalassemia were also included in the studies, but are excluded from this analysis. Analysis is based on 1-year pooled data of these two, multicenter, non-interventional observational studies. Transfusion-dependent pts with IOL with or without prior chelation were enrolled and received the iron chelator deferasirox. Prescription of deferasirox, just as inclusion and exclusion criteria was in accordance with the terms of Exjade marketing authorization in the EU. Efficacy and safety parameters, including serum ferritin and adverse events (AEs), were collected in 2-monthly intervals. Results: 98 pts had no prior chelation therapy (51 M, 45 F, 2 missing; mean age 63.3, range 3.2\u201391.9 yrs) and a median baseline SF of 2,968 (range 561\u201311, 423) ng/mL. 32 pts had prior received prior chelation therapy (mainly with desferal; 17 M, 15 F; mean age 50.1, range 3.5\u201380.9 yrs) and a median baseline SF of 2,635 (range 539\u201319, 540) ng/mL. The mean number of prior red blood cell transfusions was 55. The mean prescribed daily dose of deferasirox at the first visit was 16.3 mg/kg/d rising up to 18.1 mg/kg/d after 12 months. During treatment, median SF levels clearly decreased from first to final visit [-806 ng/mL; p<0.0001 (explorative analysis)] in the chelation-nai\u0308ve and also in the pre-chelated population [-300 ng/ml; p = 0.1705 (explorative analysis)]. The median observation period and days on therapy was 349 and 343 days, respectively. At final visit 74 pts (56.9%) were still on deferasirox therapy. Reasons for discontinuation by the final visit included 19 AEs (35.2%). 45 pts (34.6%) experienced an investigator assessed drug-related AE. The most common drug-related AEs were diarrhea (n=17; 37.8%), nausea (n=11; 24.4%) and blood creatinine increased (n=6; 13.3%). As in previous clinical trials, serum creatinine clearances showed a minor decrease over the study period (median decrease until final visit: 4 ml/min). Conclusion: Our analysis confirmed that deferasirox is effective and well tolerated in chelation-nai\u0308ve as well as in previously chelated pts with transfusion-related IOL and diseases other than MDS or beta thalassemia. As baseline serum ferritin values were >2,500 ng/mL even in pts with prior chelation therapy, adequate chelation treatment should be considered earlier at a serum ferritin >1,000 ng/mL in pts with transfusion-dependent IOL for adequate iron chelation therapy.
