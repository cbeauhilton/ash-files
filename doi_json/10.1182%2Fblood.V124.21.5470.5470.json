    "abstract_text": "Introduction. Rituximab has been demonstrated to be effective either as intralesional or as systemic therapy in PCBCL, We report our experience in the treatment of PCBCL with intravenous Rituximab. P atients and Methods From February 1999 to February 2014 we treated 75 patients: 47 Follicle Center Lymphoma, 23 Marginal Zone Lymphoma, 5 Diffuse Large Lymphoma Leg type. The stage was T1 in 38 pts, T2 in 22 pts and T3 in 15 pts. In 24 patient prior treatment included: CHT (11), Radiotherapy (4), Surgery (4) or alpha2Interferon (IFN) (5). Rituximab at dosage of 375 mg/m 2 for a minimum of 4 cycles, was administered alone (51 patients) or in association with CHT (13). RT (2) or IFN (3). Results . No patient presented adverse effects during the Rituximab infusion. A reduction of circulating B lymphocytes was observed for 11 months, on the average, without an increased risk of infections. No added toxicity was observed in patients treated with Rituximab plus CHT. Overall response rate was 97,3% (CR 82,6 %, PR 14,6 %). Five\u2013years Overall Survival (OS) was 86,9% with Disease Free Survival of 57%. According to stage OS was in T1 94,3%, in T2 90,5%, in T3 73,6%. (T1+T2 vs T3: p<0,05). Conclusions. Rituximab is effective and safe in the treatment of PCBCL even in heavily-treated or elderly patients. In our patients only the stage of disease was significant for the prognosis. A higher number of patients are necessary to indicate Rituximab in biological and clinical subsets of patients as a front-line therapy. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
