    "abstract_text": "Microscopic assessment of bone marrow response on Day 7 and/or Day 14 of induction therapy remains a powerful predictor of long-term outcome in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Between 1996 and 2000, 2175 Rome/NCI standard risk children, i.e., age >1 and 5% on Day 7 had an additional evaluation on Day 14. Patients with blasts >25% (M3) on Day 14, adverse cytogenetics (i.e., t(9;22), t(4;11), or severe hypodiploidy (modal chromosome numbers <45) received daunomycin on day 19 of induction and the augmented intensive regimen therafter ( Nachman et al, N Eng J Med  1998 ; 338 : 1663 \u201371 ). Early response and event free survival (EFS) data are depicted as follows for 2014 patients who achieved marrow blasts <5% by Day 28.  D7 Response . D14 Response . n . 5-yr. EFS . Hazard .

Induction daunomycin and stronger post induction intensification therapy may have rescued Day 7 M3/Day 14 M3 patients, who had a better EFS than the more rapidly responding Day 7 M3/Day 14 M2 patients, who received only standard strength intensification. Day 7 M3/Day 14 M2 patients received \u2018augmented therapy\u2019 on the subsequent study, CCG-1991. In summary, microscopic assessment of marrow response remains a powerful predictor of long-term outcome. Outcomes may be modified by more effective subsequent therapy."
