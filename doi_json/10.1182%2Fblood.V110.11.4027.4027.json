    "abstract_text": "Background. The hemostatic activity of plasma is due to thrombin generation (TG) provided by the interrelated activation of platelets and the plasma coagulation system. The global capacity for plasma TG can be assessed in the presence of procoagulant phospholipids (PL) as a substitute for activated platelets initiation of the reaction by tissue factor (TF). Photochemical treatment (PCT) of plasma with amotosalen and UVA light (INTERCEPT Blood System, Cerus Europe, Leusden, The Netherlands) retains adequate levels of procoagulant and antithrombotic factors according to European standards and is clinically effective. We have assessed the impact of PCT on TG using the calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT). Methods. Plasma (650mL) was collected by apheresis from 90 donors (MCS+, Haemonetics, Braintree, MA). Plasma was held at 20\u00b0\u201324\u00b0C before PCT and flash frozen at \u221280\u00b0C within 8 hrs of collection. Plasma units of 200mL were stored at \u221230\u00b0C for up to 1 year. TG was continuously measured in platelet poor plasma with a multiwell-plate reader using CAT and reagents (Thrombinoscope BV, Biodis, Signes, France). 20 \u03bcL PPP- reagent Low or High (1 or 20 pM TF and 4\u03bcM PL) were added at 37\u00b0C to triplicates of 80 \u03bcL PPP. TG measures were started by addition of 20 \u03bcL thrombin fluorescent substrate Z-GGR-AMC (2.5 mM) and CaCl 2 (17 mM). Fluorescence accumulation from cleaved AMC was measured at 390 nm and 460 nm wavelengths and converted into nanomolar thrombin using a calibrator. The area under the curve corresponds to the total potential amount of endogenous thrombin formed (ETP) and the height of the peak to the maximum concentration of thrombin (MT). Results. Plasma from 3 A, 1 AB and 3 O donors (Exp.1, Table) were tested for FVIII: before PCT, 1.08 \u00b1 0.33 U/mL and after, 0.63 \u00b1 0.20 U/mL (p < 0.01). TG was compared before and after PCT (Exp.1) at TF 1pM (control: ETP 1,906 \u00b1 129 nM.min and MT 183\u2013327 nM) and TF 20pM (control: ETP 2,026 \u00b1 151 nM.min and MT 416\u2013474 nM). Low TF (1pM) was further used to discriminate the effect of PCT on TG. In experiment 2, 12 donors (6 O, 1 AB and 5 A) tested after at day T0, before PCT (ETP 1,597 \u00b1 205 nM.min) and after (ETP 1,680 \u00b1 254 nM.min) were not different. Results were similar after day T30 storage (PCT: ETP 1,703 \u00b1 174 nM.min). Results were identical for QC (Exp.3) of 12 pools of PCT of 6 units (3O and 3A donors): mean FVIII (0.69 \u00b1 0.10 U/mL) and ETP (1,704 \u00b1 93 nM.min). Conclusions. Traditional standards have focused on FVIII levels, but TG, not modified by PCT of apheresis plasma, is of far greater relevance as it measures the efficacy of the entire hemostatic system, regardless of FVIII.
