    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4413 Dasatinib (Sprycel\u00ae) and nilotinib (Tasigna\u00ae) have each shown superior efficacy as front line treatment for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-chronic phase (CP) in comparison with imatinib. Dasatinib and nilotinib are also used for the treatment of CML patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib therapy. However, a substantial number of patients are acquired resistance to nilotinib or dasatinib, the management of CML following the development of ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance remains a challenge. Ponatinib, also known as AP24534, is an oral, the multi-targeted TKI. Ponatinib is currently being investigated in a pivotal phase 2 clinical trial (PACE trial) in patients with resistant or intolerant CML and Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). However, the molecular and functional consequences of ponatinib against ABL TKI resistant cells are not fully known. In this study, we investigated the ponatinib efficacy by using the BCR-ABL positive cell line, K562 and ABL TKI resistant (K562 imatinib resistant (K562IR), K562 nilotinib resistant (K562NR), K562 dasatinib resistant (K562DR) cells and murine Ba/F3 cell line which was transfected BCR-ABL random mutation, and established the new imatinib and nilotinib resistant Ba/F3 BCR-ABL point mutant (E334V) cells. We first examined the cell proliferation by using resistant cell lines. The proliferation of K562IR and K562 NR and K562DR did not decrease after imatinib (10 \u03bcM) or nilotinib (2 \u03bcM) or dasatinib (1 \u03bcM) treatment compared with parental cell line, K562. The BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation was not found. Point mutant Ba/F3 cell (E334V) was also highly resistant to imatinib (IC50: 15\u03bcM) and nilotinib (IC50: 7.5\u03bcM). We next examined the intracellular signaling by using these cell lines. Phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and Crk-L was not decreased by ABL TKIs in K562IR, K562NR and Ba/F3 BCR-ABL point mutant cells (E334V). We found the one of src family kinase, Lyn was activated in K562IR and K562NR cells. Co-treatment src kinase inhibitor, PP2 and imatinib or nilotinib significantly reduced the cell proliferation of K562IR and K562NR cells. We also found the phosphorylation of Lyn was reduced and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was activated. We next examined the efficacy of ponatinib against imatinib and nilotinib resistant cell lines. 72 hours treatment of ponatinib exhibits cell growth inhibition against K562 (IC50: 0.02nM), K562IR (IC50: 15nM), and K562NR (IC50: 3.5nM) cells. We also found the phosphorylation of BCR-ABL, Lyn and Crk-L was reduced and PARP was activated after ponatinib treatment. We next examined the imatinib and nilotinib resistant Ba/F3 cells with point mutant (E334V). We found the cell proliferation was significantly decreased after ponatinib treatment (IC50: 3nM). We also found the phosphorylation of BCR-ABL, Crk-L was reduced and PARP was activated after ponatinib treatment. We next investigated the ponatinib activity against dasatinib resistant cells. We found K562DR cells were highly resistant to ponatinib. IC50 was 400nM. These results suggest that the expression and protein activation signatures identified in this study provide insight into the mechanism of resistance to ABL TKIs. We also demonstrate ponatinib has anti-leukemia effect by reducing ABL and Lyn kinase activity and development of ponatinib resistance and suggests that this information may be of therapeutic relevance.
