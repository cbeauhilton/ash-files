    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4831 Introduction: Previously it was demonstrated that lymphopoiesis is rapidly established after transplantation of wild type stem cells into lymphopenic NODSCID c\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice. These data were interpreted as evidence for an \u201cempty\u201d preformed lymphopoietic niche being replenished by lymphoid progenitors. We hypothesized that antibody-induced neutropenia might influence early post transplant fate decision to myeloid rather than lymphoid differentiation resulting in delayed lymphoid reconstitution. Materials and Methods: 25,000 flow sorted CD45.2-expressing wild type Lin-/Sca1+/c-Kit+ (LSK) cells from C57BL/6 mice were transplanted into sublethally irradiated B-/T-/NK-cell deficient NODSCID c\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice (CD45.1). Three groups of n = 7 mice received anti-Gr1 or anti-1A8 i.p. every 48 h to induce continuous antibody-mediated neutropenia vs. PBS as control. Blood was harvested at regular intervals to monitor the engraftment. After 16, 22, and 34 days, animals were sacrificed and underwent blood and bone marrow analysis. Results: Hematopoietic regeneration started with the emergence of donor-derived monocytes in all groups as well as neutrophils in the control group as early as 9 days after transplantation. On day 14, B cells were to be detected for the first time, followed by T lymphocytes approximately 20 days after transplantation. Besides the fact that neutrophils were undetectable in the antibody treated groups, the peripheral blood revealed no significant changes between the neutropenic mice and the control group at any point of time. At the bone marrow level, an increase of LSK and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) at the expense of megakaryocyte erythrocyte progenitor cells (MEPs) was found in neutropenic mice. Common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), however, were not significantly different. Conclusions: The engraftment of wild type donor cells after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation into NODSCID c\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice started with the production of monocytes and neutrophils. B-lymphocytes were detectable by day 14 after transplantation. The production of T-cells started around day 20. Continuous antibody-mediated neutropenia did not significantly delay lymphoid regeneration. Although the marrow of neutropenic mice displayed increased proliferation of granulocyte progenitors, CLPs were unchanged. We conclude that the detection of donor-derived lymphocytes in the host peripheral blood is a relatively early event after LSK transplantation. Moreover, antibody induced neutropenia is not sufficient to induce sustainable changes in early hematopoietic fate decisions on the bone marrow level.
