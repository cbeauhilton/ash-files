    "abstract_text": "The recent discovery of a variety of somatic splicesomal mutations in the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) has revealed a new leukaemogenic pathway involving spliceosomal dysfunction. Pre-mRNA splicing proceeds by way of two phosphoester transfer reactions and is catalyzed by the spliceosome, which consists of the U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and numerous non-snRNP proteins. The snRNPs are involved in recognising short conserved sequences of the pre-mRNA, including the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice sites and the branch site, and in positioning the reactive nucleotides for catalysis. The spliceosome is a dynamic molecular machine, undergoing several major structural rearrangements during its functional cycle. Mutation of the Splicing Factor 3B, subunit 1 (SF3B1) gene is common in MDS, occurring in over 70% of patients whose disease is characterised by ring sideroblasts (RARS). The close association between SF3B1 mutation and ring sideroblasts is consistent with a causal relationship, and makes this the first gene to be strongly associated with a specific feature of MDS. Sf3b1 heterozygous knockout mice show the presence of ringed sideroblasts. In order to investigate the role of SF3B1 haploinsufficiency in MDS we have silenced SF3B1 using siRNA in the myeloid cell lines K562, TF-1, SKM1, HeL and OCIM2. Cell growth was impaired in all the cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown. Using Flow Cytometry, cell cycle analysis showed a significant increase in cells in the sub-G0 phase as well as G2/M arrest in the cell lines. We also observed impaired erythroid differentiation in hemin treated K562 and TF-1 cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown. Gene expression profiling (GEP) was performed in two cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown (K562 and TF1). Deregulated pathways and gene ontology categories included cell cycle regulation and alternative splicing using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. We next performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The GSEA showed a significant enrichment of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) genes that were up-regulated in cells with SF3B1 knockdown, suggesting NMD activation following SF3B1 silencing. We used Human Exon-Junction arrays (Affymetrix) to evaluate global transcript exon usage in the K562 and TF1 cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown. We observed significant differential exon usage in genes involved in RNA degradation, spliceosome, cell cycle and apoptosis. We further observed aberrant splicing of the candidate gene ABCB7 showing exon skipping and TP53 gene showing exon skipping as well as intron retention. We have investigated the changes in the transcriptome in CD34 + cells from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation by RNA sequencing and found many genes showing significant differential exon usage including CCND1, EIF3B, FKBP1A, BCL2 and RB1. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis we identified alternative splicing pattern of genes involved in cell cycle, RNA processing, mTOR signalling and P53 signalling pathways. We have studied CD34 + cells from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation in vitro and observed impairment in cell growth compared to CD34 + cells from healthy controls or from MDS patients without splicing mutations. In colony forming assays we observed a decrease in the number of erythroid or myeloid colonies derived from CD34 + cells of patients with SF3B1 mutation compared to patient CD34 + cells without splicing factor mutation. The identification of SF3B1 downstream targets in SF3B1 mutant and wild-type erythroid and myeloid colonies from MDS patients is in progress using RNA sequencing. Our results show that knockdown of SF3B1 in haematopoietic cell lines results in impaired cell growth, deregulated global gene expression and aberrant splicing. Studies of the haematopoietic progenitor CD34 + cells of patients with SF3B1 mutation show impaired cell growth and erythroid differentiation as well as deregulation of many pathways including the cell cycle and RNA processing. The identification of the key target genes affected by the common splicing mutations in MDS is critical to our understanding of how the mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder.
