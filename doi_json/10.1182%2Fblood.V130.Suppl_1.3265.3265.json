    "abstract_text": "Background. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation remains one of the life-threatening complications in recipients undergone haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haploHSCT). Reconstitution of traditional adaptive T lymphocytes is generally compromised at the early stage following transplantation, suggesting an important role of other immune effector cells in preventing from EBV reactivation. Our previous studies demonstrated that hampered recovery of CD4 - CD8 - T cells was associated with an increased occurrence of EBV reactivation after haploHSCT. \u03b3\u03b4 T is a dominant subgroup of CD4 - CD8 - T cells in the peripheral blood of healthy donors. Correlation of reconstituted \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with EBV reactivation has not been reported in the context of allogeneic HSCT. Methods. This study prospectively included 132 adult patients with hematopoietic malignancy and receiving haploHSCT. Recovery characteristics of T-cell subpopulations were monitored by flow cytometry at 30, 60, and 90 days after haploHSCT. EBV-DNA loads in the peripheral blood were detected by real-time quantitative PCR before and after transplantation. Association between \u03b3\u03b4 T recovery and EBV reactivation were statistically analyzed. Results. The median counts of peripheral V\u03b42 cells were continuously lower in recipients with EBV reactivation compared with controls at 30, 60, and 90 days post-haploHSCT ( P value was 0.006,  0.1, respectively). Conclusions. We clarified a specific association of recovered V\u03b42 but not V\u03b41 T cells with EBV reactivation following haploHSCT. These results may help better understand the intrinsic anti-EBV immunity after allogeneic HSCT and develop effective \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell-based therapy strategies.
