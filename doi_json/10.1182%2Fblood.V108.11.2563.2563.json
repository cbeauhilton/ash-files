    "abstract_text": "Recent data show that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib mesylate (IM) also affects normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), T lymphocyte activation and dendritic cell function not relying on the specific inhibition of bcr-abl activity. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been identified in the bone marrow (BM) as multipotent non-hematopoietic progenitor cells that differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, tenocytes, skeletal myocytes, and cells of visceral mesoderm. MSC interact with HSC, influencing their homing and differentiation through cell-cell contact and the production of factors including chemokines We evaluated possible effects of IM in vitro on human bone marrow-derived MSC. Screening the activity of fourty-two receptor tyrosine kinases by a phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-array revealed an exclusive inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR\u03b2) by IM which consequently affects downstream targets of PDGFR\u03b2 as Akt and Erk1/2 signalling pathways in a concentration and time dependent manner. Furthermore, perinuclear multivesicular bodies harbouring PDGFR\u03b2 were found within 18\u201320 hours culture of MSC in the presence of 5 \u03bcM IM. Cell proliferation and clonogenicity (evaluated as the capability to form colony forming units - fibroblasts (CFU-F)) of MSC were significantly inhibited by IM in a concentration dependent fashion. IM inhibits significantly the differentiation process of MSC into osteoblasts as evaluated by decreased alkaline phosphatase activity and reduced calcium phosphate precipitates. In contrary, differentiation of MSC into adipocytes was strongly favoured in presence of IM. All these functional deficits described, probably contribute to an observed 50% reduction in the support of clonogenic hematopoietic stem cells, as evaluated by a long term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC)-based assay. In summary our experiments show that IM inhibits the capacity of human MSC to proliferate and to differentiate into the osteogenic lineage, favouring adipogenesis. This effect is mainly mediated by an inhibition of PDGFR\u03b2 autophosphorylation leading to a more pronounced inhibition of PI3K/Akt compared to Erk1/2 signalling. This work confirms the role of PDGFR\u03b2 recently described for the proliferation and differentiation potential of MSC and provides a first possible explanation for the altered bone metabolism found in certain patients treated with IM."
