    "abstract_text": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells respond to chemotherapy, or more generally to DNA damages, by activating different DNA Damage Response (DDR) pathways. DDR-pathways regulate cell cycle progression and DNA damages repair. Molecular and functional alterations in key DDR-related genes drastically affect the effectiveness of DNA-damaging treatments in cancer cells. For this reasons selective DDR-inhibitors have been developed in order to sensitize cancer cells against conventional chemotherapy. Despite the proven efficacy of DDR-inhibitors in cancer treatment, only few studies have highlighted the biological consequences the prolonged inhibition of DDR-pathways in cancer cells. We hypothesized that the protracted inhibition of the DDR pathways may generate resistant clones characterized by an increased genetic instability. The aim of the study was to evaluate biological consequences of the prolonged inhibition of two crucial DDR-related kinase such as cell cycle checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) and 2 (Chk2) in B cells ALL. In particular, we investigated the consequences of Chk1/Chk2 inhibition in term of increase of genetic instability and in term of responsiveness to chemotherapy agents. Starting from B-ALL cell line NALM-6, we generated a resistant model (hereafter referred as N6R-PF8) by treating the parental cells with increasing concentration of PF-00477736 (Chk1/Chk2 inhibitor) for more than a year and increasing the IC50 value of 10-folds. From a molecular point of view, the N6R-PF8 accumulated significant molecular alterations. SNP microarray analysis highlighted different alterations in DDR-related genes and, in particular, in the ATM/CHK2 pathway. Three regions in copy number LOSS (CN=1) containing several genes involved in cell cycle checkpoint regulation (ATM and NPAT) and in the apoptosis (BIRC2, CASP1 and CASP5) were detectable only in NALM-6 parental cell lines and were copy number neutral in the resistant model. Immunoblotting analysis confirmed that in N6R-PF8 cells the ATM/CHK2 and ATR/CHK1 down-stream pathways were significant over-expressed and activated in comparison to the parental cell. Whole exome sequencing analysis showed that the two cell lines were characterized by different mutational profiles and that N6R-PF8 cells harboured significantly more genetic alterations in comparison with NALM-6 cells. Interestingly, crucial genes involved in DNA repair pathway ( MLH3 , NBN , POLD1 and PMS2 ) have been found altered only in N6R-PF8 cells. From a functional point of view, the molecular alterations characterizing the N6R-PF8 significantly compromised the cytotoxicity of PF-00477736 and of different DNA damaging agents in comparison to parental cells. Furthermore, the treatment with ATR/ATM inhibitor restored the sensitivity of N6R-PF8 to PF-00477736 and to different chemotherapy agents. In this scenario the level of expression of these two kinases seems to correlate with the sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and to PF-00477736. Finally, we confirmed that the protracted inhibition of crucial DDR-related kinase may increase the overall genetic instability in ALL cells and compromise the efficacy of DNA damaging based therapies.
