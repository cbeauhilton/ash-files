    "abstract_text": "Resistance towards proteasome inhibition by Bortezomib (Velcade\u00ae) represents a challenge for myeloma therapy. Its biology has not yet been characterized in detail. We have demonstrated that Bortezomib-sensitive malignant haematopoetic cells can acquire secondary resistance to Bortezomib in vitro. We here present the first analysis of proteasome biology and activity, alternative proteolytic pathways, ubiquitin-specific proteases (USP) and the ER stress response (unfolded protein response, UPR) upstream of the proteasome, as well as in vitro cytotoxicity of conventional cytotoxic drugs, alternative proteasome inhibitors and agents that target the UPR in Bortezomib-resistant (BR) cells, compared to wild type (WT) controls. BR cells had higher activities of all subunits of the constitutive and the immunoproteasome, as deferred from turnover of fluorogenic substrates as well as affinity-labelling of active proteasome subunits in intact cells. This was mirrored by increased levels of proteasomal \u03b21 and \u03b22, but especially \u03b25 polypeptides, implicating a homeostatic system that senses and corrects low proteasome activity in cells chronically exposed to Bortezomib. While the vinylsulfone-type proteasome inhibitor NLVS abrogated detectable proteasome activity in both BR and WT cells, Bortezomib at therapeutic concentrations eliminated proteasomal \u03b21 and \u03b25-type activity only in WT cells, while BR cells retained residual activity. These changes in proteasome biology appear to be the molecular hallmark of required Bortezomib resistance, since no changes were observed between WT and BR cells in alternative cytosolic or lysosomal proteolytic pathways, UPR activity as well as the gross activity pattern of USP. As expected, this translated into sensitivity against cytotoxic drugs in vitro: BR cells were less sensitive towards alternative proteasome inhibitors. However, while the IC50 for pan-proteasome inhibitors was only roughly doubled in BR cells, it was nearly tenfold elevated for the \u03b25-preferring vinylsulfone inhibitor NLVS. By contrast, sensitivity towards anthracyclines or cytotoxicity induced by ER stressors as well as the synergy between proteasome inhibitors and UPR-activators remained unaffected in BR cells. Based on our data, proteasome inhibitors with activity profiles different from that of Bortezomib, alone or in combination with induction of the UPR, may represent an appropriate concept to overcome secondary Bortezomib resistance."
