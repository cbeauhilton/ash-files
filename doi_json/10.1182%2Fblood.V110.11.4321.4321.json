    "abstract_text": "We previously reported that levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzyme in plasma of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may correlate with aggressive disease. However, we found poor reproducibility and significant variability from lot to lot when commercially available kits are used. We developed a cytometric beads assay (CBA) for measuring plasma MPO that shows high reproducibility (CV70 ng/ml) correlated with shorter survival (P=0.04). Similarly, patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and high levels of MPO (>70 ng/ml) had shorter survival (P=0.05). Despite there was a correlation between the commercially available kit for measuring MPO and our CBA method (r=0.71, P<0.0001), the commercial kit did not provide robust data for clinical correlation. This data confirms that confirms that plasma levels of MPO play a role in the biology of the leukemia. Further studies are needed to establish if this role is a reflection of an inflammatory process or a reflection of disease load, although the finding of clinical relevance in ALL suggests that it is more likely reflecting an inflammatory process.
