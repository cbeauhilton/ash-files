    "abstract_text": "Single-cell RNA-Seq has the potential to become a dominant approach in probing diverse and complex developmental compartments. Its unbiased and comprehensive nature could enable developmental ordering of cellular and regulatory gene hierarchies without prior knowledge. To test general utility we performed single-cell RNA-seq of murine hematopoietic progenitors focusing on the myeloid developmental hierarchy. Using novel unsupervised clustering analysis, ICDS, we correctly ordered known hierarchical states as well as revealed rare intermediates. Regulatory state analysis suggested that the transcription factors Gfi1 and Irf8 function antagonistically to control homeostatic neutrophil and macrophage production, respectively. This prediction was validated by complementary genetic and genomic experiments in granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. Using knock-in reporters for Gfi1 and Irf8 and clonogenic analyses coupled with single-cell RNA-seq we distinguished regulatory states of bi-potential progenitors from their lineage specifying or committed progeny. Thus single-cell RNA-Seq is a powerful developmental tool to characterize hierarchical and rare cellular states along with the regulators that control their dynamics.
