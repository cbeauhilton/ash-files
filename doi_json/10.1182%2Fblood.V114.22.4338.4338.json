    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4338 Objective To explore the optimum donor selection of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) applied in patients with Philadephia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia(Ph - ALL) and investigate its relevant prognostic factors. Methods A total of 48 adult patients with Ph - ALL who had admitted to our hospital and been treated by allo-HSCT from February 2002 to May 2008 were followed up until July 2008. They were divided into match related donor(MRD -HSCT) group, match unrelated donor(MUD-HSCT) and Haploidentical (Haplo-HSCT) group. Clinical characteristics of these groups were retrospectively analyzed. Survival data were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and the prognostic factors were analyzed with the COX regression model. Results Of all the 48 cases, 5-year overall survival(OS) was 45.4\u00b18.1%, disease free survival(DFS) was 40.7\u00b17.9%.The 5-year OS and DFS of MRD \u2013HSCT subgroup, MUD-HSCT subgroup and Haplo-HSCT subgroup were 50%\u00b114.4%,53.2%\u00b113.2%, 31.3%\u00b113.6%(p=0.048) and 44.7%\u00b113.3%,41.4%\u00b113.6%,32.1\u00b114.2%( p =0.167), respectively. Haplo-HSCT subgroup 5-year OS lower than other two subgroups, which showed statistical significance. GradeIIto\u2021W acute graft versus host disease(aGVHD) [ p =0.001, RR =6.980] and white blood cell at diagnosis higher than 30\u00d710 9 /L[ p =0.028, RR =2.679]were the risk factor of OS in multiple covariate analysis model. The HSCT type was not independent risk factor of OS. Conclusion MUD-HSCT and MRD-HSCT have similar efficacy in adult Ph - ALL. Haplo-HSCT can be a distinct option in High-risk adult Ph - ALL patients without a MRD and MUD. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
