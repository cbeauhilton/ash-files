    "abstract_text": "Background: Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms develop after cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The available data on the outcome of pts with t-de novo AML without antecedent history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is limited. Methods: We reviewed the records of pts with newly diagnosed AML who presented to our tertiary care center from 1/2000 to 1/2014. t-de novo AML was defined as having at least 20% blasts in bone marrow with a history of any previous cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and without an antecedent history of MDS. Leukemia-free survival (LFS) was defined as time from achieving complete response (CR) to relapse or death. The overall survival (OS) and LFS in pts with t-de novo AML were compared to those of with de novo AML with normal karyotype (NK) and complex karyotype (CK). Results: Among 1677 pts with newly diagnosed AML, 383 had de novo NK-AML, 218 had de novo CK-AML, and 187 had t-de novo AML. The median follow-up was 9.3 months (range; 0.2-161.0). Pt characteristics and outcomes are described in Table 1. Among the 187 pts, 69 had a history of lymphoma; 63 pts breast cancer (Ca); 10 pts colon Ca; 10 pts sarcoma; 8 pts prostate; 7 pts bladder Ca; 6 pts uterine Ca; 5 pts lung Ca; 5 pts head and neck Ca; 30 pts other type of Ca. Among the pts with t-de novo AML, 15 pts (8%) had a favorable-risk karyotype by WHO, 53 pts (28%) intermediate-risk karyotype, and 119 pts (64%) poor-risk karyotype. The median LFS duration in t-de novo AML, NK-AML, and CK-AML were 7 months (95% confidence interval [CI]; 5.1-8.7), 19 months (95% CI; 13.0-25.2), and 6 months (95% CI; 9.0-13.5) ( p <.001), respectively. The median OS duration in t-de novo AML, NK-AML, and CK-AML were 7 months (95% CI; 5.9-8.9), 21 months (95% CI; 16.2-25.5), and 12 months (95%CI; 10.6-13.5) ( p <.001), respectively. The results of univariate (UVA) and multivariate analysis (MVA) associated with OS were summarize in Table 1. MVA identified age over 60, white blood cell count (WBC) over 10 x10 3 /\u00b5L, thrombocytopenia below 30 x10 3 /\u00b5L, non-favorable cytogenetic abnormalities, positive RAS mutation, and the absence of CR or CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) as poor prognostic features related to OS. Conclusion: LFS and OS were shorter in patients with t-de novo AML than in those with NK-AML but did not differ significantly from patients with CK-AML. Abstract 2273. Table 1.
