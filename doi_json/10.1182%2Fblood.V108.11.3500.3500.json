    "abstract_text": "Background: Myeloma remains incurable due to a stem cell/proliferative component that responds poorly to standard treatments. We have shown that aberrant IL-1beta stimulates the generation of paracrine IL-6, a central myeloma growth factor. A Phase II trial was completed using IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra/Anakinra), which inhibits paracrine IL-6 production, and low dose Dexamethasone (Dex), which decreases IL-1 levels through myeloma cell apoptosis, in patients with SMM/IMM. SMM/IMM patients are most likely to benefit from anti-cytokine therapy in order to delay/prevent the development of active myeloma. Methods: Patients that had \u2265 10% bone marrow plasma cells and/or an IgG or IgA M-spike \u2265 3 g/dL and did not require immediate chemotherapy were eligible. All patients received 100 mg of IL-1Ra SQ qd for 6 months unless clinical progression occurred. Non-progressors were allowed to continue on therapy with IL-1Ra alone. Low dose Dex (20 mg qweek) was added after 6 months of IL-1Ra or for evidence of clinical progression; the dose was adjusted based on response/toxicity. Results: To investigate the effects of IL-1Ra and Dex alone and in combination in vitro, we co-cultured IL-1beta transduced +/\u2212 myeloma cells with stromal cells +/\u2212 dexamethasone, IL-1Ra, or both for 48 hours and quantitated the percent apoptotic cells by flow cytometry and IL-6 production by ELISA. The results showed that: 1) IL-1Ra was superior to Dex at inhibition of IL-6 but caused no myeloma apoptosis; 2) Dex induced apoptosis was inhibited by IL-6 3) Dex and IL-1Ra combined induced maximal IL-6 inhibition and apoptosis of myeloma cells. In the clinical trial, data were available on 47 patients; smoldering (79%) / indolent (21%). All patients received IL-1Ra initially and 20/47 subsequently received IL-1Ra/Dex. Seven patients had a decrease in the plasma cell labeling index (PCLI), a marker of cell proliferation, on IL-1Ra alone which paralleled a decrease in the high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP). Interestingly, in one patient treated with Dex alone for 6 months, Dex induced a decrease in the M-protein and IL-1 levels, however, the PCLI and CRP values increased. The IL-1Ra/Dex combination has resulted in stability of disease in the majority of the 47 patients; 28 continue on therapy with a median overall progression-free survival (PFS) of 37.5 months. Four of the 47 pts achieved a minor response (MR) with IL-1Ra alone, and an additional 6 pts achieved a MR/PR after addition of dex. The continuous measure of % reduction in CRP was significantly associated with time to progression (p=0.02). Similarly, those patients who had a >5% decrease in serum M protein also had a longer PFS (p<0.001). Of note, 2 patients with high PCLI values of 6.4 and 3.0, characteristic of poor prognosis, responded with a reduction in the PCLI values and continue on combination therapy for 3 and 1.5 years, respectively with stable disease. Conclusion: Agents such as IL-1Ra that specifically inhibit paracrine IL-6 production are more effective at targeting the proliferative component than apoptosis inducing agents such as Dex; the combination may be especially useful in patients that have an elevated PCLI at presentation.",
