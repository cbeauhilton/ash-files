    "abstract_text": "FTY720 (FTY), a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonist, inhibits lymphocyte egress from lymphoid tissues although the complete mechanism of its immunomodulatory effects is not well understood. We studied FTY in murine GVHD and engraftment models as a single agent and in combination with known beneficial strategies. FTY (3 mg/kg orally d0-28) inhibited GVHD, increasing the median survival time (MST) of lethally irradiated C57BL/6 (B6) mice given BALB/c BM and a moderate T cell dose from 30d to 71d (p96%) at 1 month but chimerism was lost in 3 mice by 6 months after BMT. In a different strain combination, even a 2 wk FTY course increased donor chimerism that remained stable for 6 months. Imaging studies revealed that FTY did not prevent the egress of adoptively transferred host-type GFP T cells in allogeneic BM recipients. FTY was also tested in combination with anti-CD40L mAb, a potent engraftment-promoting agent in mice. In contrast to anti-CD40L mAb, FTY did not promote engraftment in mice conditioned with very low levels of irradiation (0.5\u20132.0 Gy) although the combination of anti-CD40L mAb and FTY resulted in superior stable engraftment rates and levels compared to anti-CD40L mAb as a single agent. Interestingly, FTY increased donor chimerism in syngeneic, as well as, allogeneic recipients. These data indicate that FTY is efficacious as a single or adjunct agent for the prevention of GVHD and graft rejection and further indicate that inhibition of lymphocyte egress was not essential for the beneficial effects of FTY in BMT recipients."
