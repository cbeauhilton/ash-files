    "abstract_text": "Abstract 413 Relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a leading cause of death due to disease in young people, but the biologic determinants of treatment failure remain poorly understood. To identify novel sequence mutations contributing to relapsed in ALL, we resequenced 300 genes in matched diagnosis and relapse samples from 23 patients with ALL. The cohort included B-progenitor ALL with high hyperdiploidy (N=3), TCF3-PBX1 (N=1), ETV6-RUNX1 (N=3), rearrangement of MLL (N=3), BCR-ABL1 (N=3), and low hyperdiploid, pseudodiploid, or miscellaneous karyotypes (N=10). This identified 52 somatic non-synonymous mutations in 32 genes, many of which were novel, including mutations in the transcriptional coactivators CREBBP and NCOR1 , the transcription factors ERG , SPI1 , TCF4 and TCF7L2 , components of the Ras signalling pathway, histone genes, genes involved in histone modification ( CREBBP and CTCF) , and genes previously shown to be targets of recurring DNA copy number alteration in ALL. Analysis of an extended cohort of 63 diagnosis-relapse cases and 200 acute leukaemia cases that did not relapse found that 19% of relapse cases had sequence or deletion mutations of CREBBP , which encodes the transcriptional coactivator and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) CREB-binding protein (CBP). The mutations were either present at diagnosis, acquired at relapse, or duplicated to homozygosity at the time of relapse. Moreover, several mutations acquired at relapse were detected in subclones at diagnosis, suggesting that the mutations confer a selective advantage and promote resistance to therapy. The mutations either resulted in truncated alleles or deleterious substitutions in highly conserved residues of the HAT domain. To examine the functional consequences of the mutations, we introduced wild type or mutant Crebbp alleles into Cbp/Ep300 flox/flox murine embryonic fibroblasts, (dKO MEFs), and examined histone acetylation, expression of CREBBP target genes, and cellular proliferation. The HAT domain mutations resulted in impaired acetylation of the key Crebbp substrate, H3K18, and resulted in impaired transcriptional regulation of multiple CREBBP targets and pathways, including cAMP, dsRNA and dexamethasone responsive genes. The latter observation suggests that CREBBP mutations may directly result in resistance to corticosteroid therapy, which is a hallmark of high risk ALL. Together, these data these results extend the landscape of genetic alterations in leukemia, and identify mutations targeting transcriptional and epigenetic regulation as a mechanism of resistance in ALL.
