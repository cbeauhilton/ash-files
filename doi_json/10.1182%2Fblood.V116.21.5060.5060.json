Cancer 2007). We sought to validate the Italian Translation of the MPN-SAF which addresses 19 separate symptoms reported by MPN patients. Methods: Translation: We utilized the standard practice of PRO translation in which 3 independent translations are created by 3 independent translators fluent in both languages. A fourth translator then discussed the translations with the other translators and a consensus translation was obtained. Validation: Patients self completed the MPN-SAF: Italian at the time of a physician office visit and the Italian EORTC-QLQ-C30 (a widely used instrument of PRO for cancer patients) was co-administered for validation purposes. Results: Patients and Symptomatic Burden: 186 patients were prospectively enrolled (ET (N=88; 47%), PV (N=69; 37%) and MF (N=29; 16%)) a median of 6 years (range:0-29) from their diagnosis. Patients were of a median age (62; range 29\u201391 years) and gender (56% females) typical of the disease. 72% (N=135) had received some form of non-aspirin medical therapy for their disease, and 68% were on therapy at the time of completing the questionnaire. Patients frequently had a history of either thrombotic events (31%) and/or hemorrhagic events (13%). The MPN-SAF measured 19 items in the enrolled patients (data summarized in Table 1 ).

Excellent correlations were demonstrated between EORTC-QLQ-C30 subscales and corresponding MPN-SAF measurements. Comparison with MPN-SAF:English: Comparison with 102 patients prospectively completing the MPN-SAF: English (ET=20, PV=23, MF=59) in the USA indicated very strong correlations (when controlling for MPN subtype) in the prevalence of all 19 items assessed and only subtle differences in terms of symptomatic severity for fatigue, itching and insomnia. Conclusions: The MPN-SAF:Italian is an easy to administer, clear, 19-item inventory of patient-reported outcomes that is specific to MPNs. Additionally, the instrument is validated by 1) comparison to previously validated Italian instruments and 2) the correlation with the MPN-SAF:English. Utilization of the instrument in Italian MPN clinical trials will allow for useful comparison to patients completing the MPN-SAF in other countries and will serve as a valuable clinical marker of disease symptom severity.
