    "abstract_text": "Cohort studies have identified VWF gene mutations in ~65% of patients with type 1 Von Willebrand Disease (VWD). However, in patients with mild reductions in Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) levels, VWF mutations are less common and linkage studies suggest that the reduced plasma VWF levels are often independent of the VWF gene. Important clinical questions therefore remain unanswered regarding diagnosis and management of patients with Low VWF (levels 30-50 IU/dL). Evidence-based diagnostic criteria are needed for establishing the diagnosis of Low VWF, and the relationship between Low VWF levels and bleeding phenotype needs to be defined. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the reduced plasma VWF levels remain unclear. To address these questions, we established the Low VWF Ireland Cohort (LoVIC) study. In contrast to previous Type 1 VWD studies, this prospective longitudinal cohort study recruited only patients with Low VWF levels, (defined by bleeding history and lowest VWF levels 30-50 IU/dL on two occasions, three months apart) and recruited 140 adult Irish patients. Although Bleeding Assessment Tools (BATs) have been used in type 1 VWD, their utility has not been studied in patients with Low VWF. As determined using either the ISTH BAT or the Condensed MCMDM-1 VWD score, we observed significant bleeding histories in the majority of LoVIC patients. For example, among female patients (n=112), 77% had positive ISTH BAT scores (\u22656) and 72% had positive MCMDM-1 scores (\u22654). Importantly, bleeding tendency did not correlate with plasma VWF levels within the 30-50 IU/dL range. To further investigate this bleeding phenotype, hemostatic studies (including platelet aggregation and coagulation factor assays) were performed. Additional mild coagulation defects were identified in only 10 subjects. Furthermore, abnormal multimer patterns were identified in only 3 patients. To investigate the pathophysiology underlying Low VWF levels, plasma FVIII:C and VWF propeptide (VWF:pp) levels were defined. Interestingly, plasma FVIII:C/VWF:Ag ratios were significantly increased in LoVIC patients compared to normal controls (mean 1.3 versus 1.07; p 3 were observed in only 6% of the total cohort. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the reduced plasma VWF levels in patients with Low VWF are predominantly attributable to decreased VWF synthesis and/or secretion rather than enhanced VWF clearance. To determine whether quantitative and/or qualitative abnormalities in platelet (plt)-VWF may influence bleeding phenotype in patients with Low VWF, we studied plt-VWF:Ag and VWF:CB in 50 consecutive LoVIC patients. In keeping with the hypothesis that reduced VWF synthesis plays a key role in the pathogenesis underlying Low VWF levels, plt-VWF:Ag and plt-VWF:CB levels were both significantly reduced in LoVIC patients compared to controls (mean plt-VWF:Ag 0.16 versus 0.21 IU/10 9 /L, p<0.05; mean plt-VWF:CB 0.18 versus 0.34 IU/10 9 /L, p<0.001). To further study the molecular mechanisms underlying Low VWF levels, plasma VWF:Ag and VWF:RCo responses following desmopressin (DDAVP) administration were examined. In 88% of patients, the post-DDAVP peak levels exceeded 100 IU/dL. Importantly, the response to DDAVP was also sustained with both VWF:Ag and VWF:RCo above 100 IU/dL after 4 hours in 72% subjects. These DDAVP responses demonstrate that Weibel Palade body stores of VWF are maintained in patients with Low VWF, and that the regulated pathway of VWF secretion is intact. Furthermore, the sustained plasma VWF response observed following DDAVP supports the hypothesis that enhanced VWF clearance does not play a major role in the pathogenesis of Low VWF levels. In conclusion, we demonstrate that Low VWF levels are associated with a significant bleeding phenotype. In addition, we further show that in the majority of patients with Low VWF levels, the bleeding phenotype cannot be explained by the presence of concomitant bleeding disorders. Finally, our novel data demonstrate that Low VWF levels are due in large part to reductions in VWF synthesis and/or constitutive secretion. Although enhanced VWF clearance may contribute to the pathophysiology in a minority of individuals with Low VWF, the absolute reduction in VWF plasma half-life is usually mild and not sufficient to significantly impact upon the duration of DDAVP-induced VWF response.
