    "abstract_text": "Background: Immunoglobulin (IGH, IGL, IGK) and non-immunoglobulin (PVT1, TXNDC5, FAM46C, DUSP22, etc.) enhancers hijacking by variable genes (MYC, MAF, MAFB, CCND1/2/3, MMSET, IRF4) is a recognized oncogenic driver event in MM. However, the identity of the transcription factors (TFs) or transcriptional regulatory complexes binding and regulating the activity of these enhancers remains to be fully elucidated and may yield valuable therapeutic targets. As such the discovery of the BET family member BRD4 as the master histone acetyl mark reader at enhancers loci regulating MYC lead to promising therapeutic developments in MM and numerous other cancers. Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) promote the proteasomal degradation of IKAROS (IKZF1) and AIOLOs (IKZF3) leading to the transcriptional repression of MYC and the suppression of MM cells survival and proliferation. However, acquired resistance to IMIDs and the loss of the transcriptional repression of MYC are nearly universal and occur in spite of sustained IKZF1/3 degradation suggesting that transcriptional rewiring may be sustaining hijacked enhancers activity and transcription of driver oncogenes. Methods and Results: In order to define how IMiDs repress MYC transcription, we first defined IKZF1, BRD4, the lysine acetyl transferase P300 and the mediator complex subunit MED1 mapping within the MM genome using ChIPseq. In MM cell lines (MM1S, RPMI8226, ARP1 and AMO1), IKZF1 predominantly mapped to intronic and intergenic loci which are typically enriched with enhancer and superenhancer elements. Indeed, IKZF1 mapping to the genome nearly completely (96.5%) overlapped that of P300, MED1 and BRD4 co-occupied enhancer and superenhancer loci. We also confirmed that in the MM1S sensitive cell lines IMiDs (lenalidomide 10 \u03bcM, 24h) exposure efficiently depleted IKZF1, BRD4, P300 and MED1 at enhancer loci with ensuing MYC (and MAF) downregulation. In contrast, in resistant cell lines (RPMI8226) and in spite efficient IKZF1 displacement, BRD4, P300 and MED1 were retained at the oncogenic enhancer (IGLL5) driving MYC (and MAF). These findings lead us to postulate that in IMiDs resistant cells retention of BRD4 and MED1 at oncogenic enhancers in the absence of IKZF1 likely results from rewiring of the TFs regulating MYC. To identify TFs that may co-localize with BRD4 and IKZF1, we analyzed the enrichment of DNA motifs at IKZF1and BRD4 co-occupied enhancers using the MEME suite motif-finding algorithms. This computational analysis revealed a strong enrichment at these MM enhancers of the GGAA motif recognized by the ETS family of TFs ( P = 3.2 e -743 ) and other motifs boxes for the RUNX ( P = 9.6 e -725 ), MYC/MYB ( P = 8.8 e -52 ) and interferon regulatory (IRF) ( P = 3.1 e -293 ) TFs. We next confirmed that the ETS family TF ETV4 was indeed expressed in IMiDs resistant, but not sensitive, MM cell lines. ChiPseq occupancy profiles in IMiDs resistant RPMI8226 cell line revealed co-localization of ETV4 with IKZF1, P300 and BRD4. As predicted, lenalidomide treatment induced global depletion of IKZF1 but not ETV4 at BRD4 occupied enhancers in resistant cell lines (RPMI8226 and ARP1). Importantly, Cas9-mediated knock out of ETV4 in RPMI8226 cells sensitized them to lenalidomide with ensuing MYC downregulation and cell death. Confirming its role in MM, ETV4 transcript was indeed detectable in primary patients' samples in the CoMMpass data repository (ETV4 FPKM >1.0 in 112/724) and its expression was associated with significantly reduced survival outcomes (HR 0.64; P=0.0008). Similarly, high expression (top quartiles) of RUNX2 or MYB, TFs with enriched motifs at IKZF1 co-occupied enhancer loci, was also associated with decreased survival. Of note RNAseq analysis of paired patient samples pre- and post-IMiDs treatment (n=14 pairs) revealed significant upregulation of ETV4 at the time of acquired IMiDs resistance (7/14). Lastly transcriptome analysis of 101 patients enrolled in the RD arm (lenalidomide and dexamethasone) of the POLLUX trial (NCT02076009) confirmed the reduced survival of patients with top quartiles expression of ETV4 as well as MYB and RUNX2 (Fig.1) Conclusion: Transcriptional plasticity with expression of extra-lineage TFs such as the ETS family member ETV4 sustains oncogenic enhancers in MM overcoming IKAROS and AIOLOS dependency and promoting IMiDs resistance.
