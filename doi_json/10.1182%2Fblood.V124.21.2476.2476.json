    "abstract_text": "To investigate the incidence and risk factors for the occurrence of proven or probable invasive fungal infection (IFI) in adult patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), 421 patients undergoing HSCT between 2002 and 2013 in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Thirty-one patients with the median age of 42 years (range: 19-60) developed IFI after HSCT. The post-HSCT IFI incidence was 7.4% and median time from HSCT to the diagnosis of IFI was 139 days (range: 2-1809). The risk factors for the occurrence of IFI were analyzed using Cox regression models.Of the pretransplant factors, European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EMBT) risk>2 (P=0.001) and prior history of IFI (P=0.006) or DM (P=0.042) were the significant predictors for post-HSCT IFI by univariate analyses. In multivariate analysis, EMBT risk>2 (P=0.015) and prior history of IFI (P=0.006) retained significance. Of the post-transplant factors, acute graft-versus-disease (aGVHD) overall grade III-IV (P<0.001), extensive chronic GVHD (cGVHD) (P=0.002), post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) (P=0.005) and the use of high-dose steroids (P<0.001) were statistically significant in univariate analyses. After multivariate analysis, high-dose steroids (P<0.001) and aGVHD overall grade III-IV (P=0.045) retained significance. These results suggest that risk group stratification prior HSCT and monitoring of IFI in patients with severe GVHD and receiving high-dose steroids is mandatory to decrease the risk of post-HSCT IFI, especially in those with prior history of IFI.
