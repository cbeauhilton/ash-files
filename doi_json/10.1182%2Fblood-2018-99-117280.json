    "abstract_text": "In the human beta-globin gene locus, an LTR retrotransposon derived from ERV-9 human endogenous retrovirus is located near the locus control region (LCR) far upstream of the globin genes. In transgenic mice carrying the 100 kb human globin gene locus, deleting the ERV-9 LTR by cre-loxP mediated in situ recombination inactivates transcription of beta-globin gene by ~50% and activates that of gamma-globin gene by up to 5 fold, to at least 20% the level of beta-globin mRNA in both fetal and adult erythroid cells. Chromosome-conformation-capture (3C) shows that the ERV-9 LTR preferentially loops with beta-globin gene, even in fetal erythroid cells where gamma-globin gene is predominantly transcribed. Unique in the locus, the ERV-9 LTR contains high density of CCAAT motifs that strongly bind transcription factor (TF) NF-Y critical for assembling the LTR enhancer complex but no CCNCNCCC motifs that bind master erythroid TF KLF1, while the beta-globin promoter contains two tandem CCNCNCCC motifs that bind KLF1 but a CCAAT motif that only weakly bind NF-Y. However, both the LTR and beta-globin promoter associate in vivo with high levels of NF-Y and KLF1 in ChIP assays. Protein immunoprecipitation shows that neither NF-Y nor KLF1 associates with transcription co-regulator Ldb1, which has been reported to mediate chromosome looping of the LCR with the globin genes. Thus, the Ldb1/LMO2/GATA -1, -2 complex potentially assembled by the GATA motifs distributed throughout the locus does not appear to mediate the preferential looping of ERV-9 LTR with beta-globin promoter. Through interaction of NF-Y and KLF1 mediated by the to be identified co-regulator, the ERV-9 LTR interacts with and activates beta-globin gene, and suppresses gamma-globin gene by a competitive mechanism. Deletion of the ERV-9 LTR removes the competitive advantage of beta-globin gene, thus re-activating gamma-globin gene. Our findings suggest that deleting the ERV-9 LTR from the globin locus by genome-editing could provide a potential new therapy for beta-hemoglobinopathies.
