    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2364 Background: Survival after immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for aplastic anemia (AA) depends on disease severity, which is classified according to polymorphic neutrophil (PMN) count as follows: nonsevere AA (nSAA; PMN > 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L); severe AA (SAA; PMN 0.2 \u2013 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L); and very severe AA (vSAA; PMN < 0.2 \u00d7 10 9 /L). Although patients with fulminant AA, defined as PMN = 0 for > 2 weeks, generally have poor outcome, no data are available for a large cohort. Therefore, we evaluated the outcome of children with fulminant AA who were enrolled in an AA-97 study and received ATG, cyclosporine, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Patients and Methods: A total of 288 children newly diagnosed with AA (median age, 8 years) were enrolled into an AA-97 study between 1997 and 2006 and treated with a combination of horse antithymocyte globulin (Lymphoglobulin \u00ae ) and cyclosporine. For patients with PMN < 0.2 \u00d7 10 9 /L, G-CSF was added. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to disease severity as follows: fulminant (PMN 0, n = 35); vSAA (PMN 0 \u2013 0.2 \u00d7 10 9 /L, n = 129); and SAA (PMN 0.2 \u2013 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L, n = 124). Of the 35 patients with fulminant AA, 8 had a history of acute hepatitis at the time of diagnosis. One case was considered to be drug-induced AA. The remaining 26 patients had unknown etiology. We evaluated the response rate (RR) at 6 months, 5-year overall survival (OS), and 5-year failure free survival (FFS). Treatment failure was defined as death due to any cause, a requirement for a secondary therapy, relapse, clonal evolution to myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelocytic leukemia, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Results: The children with fulminant AA showed a significantly lower RR than those with vSAA and SAA (40.0%, 62.8%, and 64.5%, respectively; p =.023). Of the 20 non-responders in the fulminant AA group, 11 were rescued by alternative donor stem cell transplantation, and 5 achieved a late response after 6 months. As a result, no significant difference was noted in 5-year OS and 5-year FFS among the children with fulminant AA, vSAA, and SAA (88.5%/48.2%, 95.8%/65.1%, and 96.8%/68.1%, respectively). Conclusion: In consideration of favorable OS, the choice of IST is indicated in children with fluminant AA who lack an HLA-matched family donor.
