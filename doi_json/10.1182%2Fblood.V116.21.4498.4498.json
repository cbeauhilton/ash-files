    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4498 Background: Chronic Myeloid Leukemia(CML) is an myloproliferative disorder characterized by the expansion of clone of hematopoietic cells that carries the Philadelphia chromosome(Ph).The Ph chromosome results from a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosome 9 and 22,t(9;22) (q34;q11).The molecular consequence of this translocation is a fusion gene. Imatinib inhibits constitutively active BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML).This is a novel molecule, which inhibits the protein product of this fusion gene and hence has been used in the treatment of CML. We are now report 51 months of median follow-up data and focus on 645 number of patients who received Imatinib as a primary treatment from 2002 to 2010. Materials and Methods: We included total 645 patients of CML during the period of January 2002 to June 2010.The age range was 02\u201387 years with median age being 36\u00b111.6 years. Among 645 patient 366 was male and 280 female. A total 645 patients 608was in chronic phase, 31 in accelerated phase and 5 patients had blast crisis at the time of presentation. At present the molecular status of the disease has been detected by RT PCR, Flowcytometry (By Fluorescence Activated Cell sorter, FACS), Karyotyping and FISH.As a runtime protocol we have used Imatinib as 400 mg/day as standard dose at chronic phase, 600 mg/day in accelerated phase and 800 mg/day in blast crisis.We have studied a comparative analysis of Hematological parameter values. Result: The best observed average rate of complete hematological response was 97%, complete cytogenetic response was 50%, complete molecular response 35% with partial response in 45% and poor response in 15%.After 1 year levels of BCR-ABL transcripts had fallen in 52% patients and after 4 years levels had fallen in 79%. Conclusion: At 51 months of median follow-up in our study, comparative analysis of haematological parameters like haemoglobin, Total Count, Platelet Count between patient and normal population revels that pre-treatment value against normal value is very significant. The post treatment value of the haematological parameters is very close to the normal values and hence it can be proved that Imatinib therapy is effective. We observed that Imatinib drug is tolarence in case of 90% patients and resistance in about 10 % patient. So, we can conclude that Imatinib is an effective and safe drug for CML patient.
