    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2238 Introduction: We are developing RMP for use as an infusible hemostatic agent to treat bleeding conditions. Preliminary evaluations in vitro , such as by thromboelesatography (TEG), were very promising, and were supported by in vivo studies in a small animal (rat) [Haemophilia 2011; 17: 44]. It was shown that RMP not only accelerate coagulation and correct hemostatic aberration of factor-deficient plasma but also enhance platelet aggregation and adhesion, suggesting its efficacy in both primary and secondary hemostasis [Blood 2011; 118:3263]. Here we report results of initial studies in a large animal, the rabbit ear bleeding model. Methods: RMP were produced by high-pressure extrusion of human RBC, converting >99% of RBC to RMP. Hemostatic efficacy was evaluated in a rabbit ear bleeding model. New Zealand male white rabbits of 2.5\u20133.5 kg were used. After sedation, the ear was prepared by chlorhexidime scrub, then a standard incision 6 mm wide was made to penetrate the ear (#11 scalpel blade), in a region of the ear devoid of macroscopic (visible) vessels. The ear was maintained at 37\u00b0C with a heating pad. Bleeding time (BT) was defined as the time required for the disappearance of blood stains on a filter paper blot. To reliably measure reduction of BT by the RMP product, bleeding was prolonged by administration of busulfan (20 mg/kg SC) twice each at days 1 and 3, to suppress bone marrow, resulting in thrombocytopenia after 7\u201312 days. BT was significantly prolonged in animals when platelet counts fell to <60,000/\u03bcL. This regimen allowed all animals to survive, but higher doses of busulfan was toxic and caused severe pancytopenia, unacceptable for experimentation. Results: In normal (untreated) rabbits, the BT was 90 \u00b120 seconds (n = 12). Injection of RMP (3\u00d710 9 /kg, IV) in untreated rabbits resulted in no significant changes in BT, and no major adverse events were seen (n = 6). In thrombocytopenic rabbits, the BT was prolonged to 620 \u00b1130 sec., and prolongation of BT correlated with decrease in platelet counts, 30,000 \u2013 60,000/\u03bcL (n = 12). In this range of platelet counts, injection of RMP (at either 1 \u00d7 10 9 or 3 \u00d7 10 9 /kg, IV) induced significant shortening of BT, to 440 \u00b190 sec (n = 8) at the lower dose (p15 min, RMP had no significant effect. The hemostatic effects disappeared if >30 min elapsed between RMP infusion and making the incision, indicating a short half-life of RMP in circulation. Conclusions: These data confirm efficacy of RMP in thrombocytopenic rabbits. Hemostatic efficacy of RMP was evident in moderate thrombocytopenia, and was dose-dependent. However, efficacy fell off if platelets <10,000/\u03bcL, indicating that RMP augment platelet activity but do not replace platelets. In both thrombocytopenic and non-thrombocytopenic rabbits, no major adverse reactions were observed with infusion of RMP. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
