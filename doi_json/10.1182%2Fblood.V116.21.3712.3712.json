    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3712 Injection of donor derived T-cellular precursors has been proposed as a novel strategy to shorten delayed reconstitution of the T-lymphoid compartment following HSCT. In the past years, several research groups have successfully generated murine and human T-cellular precursors in vitro using Notchligand-based coculture systems such as OP9-DL1 or Tst-DL4. Murine T-cellular precursors generated in vitro , promoted reconstitution of the T-cellular compartment when applied in murine HSCT-models. In consistency, transfer of human T-cellular precursors, generated in vitro in coculture with OP9-DL1 or Tst-DL4 resulted in enhanced thymic repopulation in NOD/SCID/gc \u2212/\u2212 mice. Yet, positive effects on peripheral T-cell reconstitution have not been reported. Moreover, clinical application of OP9-DL1 or Tst-DL4 coculture systems is limited, since they consist of murine stromal cells transduced with either DL1 or DL4. It has been described that exposure of CD34 + cells to immobilized DL4 induces T-cell differentiation in vitro and allows expansion human T-cellular precursors even in absence of stromal cell support. However, the hypothesis that DL4 alone can drive hematopoietic progenitors towards a T-cell fate in vitro, requires more evidence. Here, we further characterized the in vitro and in vivo potential of T-cellular precursors generated by single exposure to DL4. We exposed human CD34 + progenitors to immobilized DL4 in the presence of different cytokine combinations implicated in human haematopoiesis. Within 7 days, CD34 + CD7 + and CD34 \u2212 CD7 ++ T-cellular precursors emerged in the presence of DL4, but not under control conditions. After 7 days the CD34 + CD7 + population subsequently declined while the CD34 \u2212 CD7 ++ population further expanded. Two distinct progenitor subsets, CD5+ and CD5-, emerged within the CD34 \u2212 CD7 ++ population. The CD34 \u2212 CD7 ++ CD5 + subset partially acquired CD1a, corresponding to a developmental stage between the early thymic progenitor (ETP) and the prethymocyte (pre-T) stage. Conversely to what observed in the OP9-DL1 system, T-cell development did not progress beyond the pre-T-stage. Indeed, we neither observed more advanced stages of T-cell development, such as immature single positive CD4 + cells, nor complete TCR-rearrangements. 7-day exposure to immobilized DL4 induced a 90-fold increase of T-precursor frequency in CD34 + progenitors (1/8800 before culture vs. 1/90 after culture) as confirmed by limiting dilution assays on OP9-DL1. All T-cellular precursor activity was restricted to cells expressing CD34, CD7 or both (frequency: 1/9). In particular, elevated T-cellular precursor levels were found in the subsets expressing CD7 (CD34 + /CD7 + and CD34 \u2212 /CD7 + ), while the T-cellular precursor frequency in the CD34 + /CD7 \u2212 subset was equal to that seen in non-cultured CD34 + progenitors. In consistency the CD34 \u2212 CD7 \u2212 population did not contain any detectable T-cellular precursors. After 7 day exposure to DL4, cells phenotypically corresponding to T-cellular precursors were transferred into NOD/SCID/gc \u2212/\u2212 mice. Within 2 months following HSCT, cells exposed to DL4 were able to reconstitute the recipients' thymus and partially gave rise to peripheral T-cells. When injecting non-cultured CD34 + progenitors, thymic reconstitution was likewise seen 2 months after HSCT. However, intrathymic T-cell development was less advanced and peripheral T-cells were absent. In contrast, cells cultured in presence of a control peptide did not retain any potential to repopulate the recipients' thymus. Our experiments provide further evidence that exposure DL4 induces early human T-cell development and allows generation of large numbers of T-cellular precursors in vitro . These precursors feature phenotypical and molecular properties corresponding to early precursors found in the human thymus. Furthermore, they have an increased potential to further differentiate into mature T-cells in vitro and when transferred into immunodeficient mice. Our preliminary data suggest, that injection of T-cellular precursors accelerates T-cell reconstitution after HSCT and provides further evidence for the feasibility of this novel strategy of immunotherapy.
