    "abstract_text": "Abstract 682 Erythropoietin (EPO) and its receptor (EPOR) serve well as an informative paradigm for understanding hematopoietic growth factor effects and receptor action mechanisms. Recently, interest in EPO/EPOR investigations has been heightened based on the clinical emergence of novel EPO mimetics, and by reported EPO/EPOR activities in modulating cellular immunity, diabetic susceptibility, retinopathy and the cytoprotection of select non-hematopoietic tissues. To better understand EPOR action modes, we presently have applied a global phosphoproteomics approach to specifically discover new targets of EPO/EPOR-regulated tyrosine phosphorylation. Using an EPO-dependent erythroid progenitor cell model, our LC-MS/MS approach was first validated for known EPO/EPOR-targets (e.g., JAK2, STATs, SHIPs, PLCgamma, GABs). Second, among certain known targets, new phosphorylation sites were identified. Third, several novel major downstream targets of EPO/EPOR were discovered. One (a previously uncharacterized open reading frame here designated as \u201cRHEX26\u201d) was induced \u223c20-fold in tyrosine-phosphorylation by EPO treatment. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses of tissues and primary hematopoietic cells indicate RHEX26 expression to be erythroid- restricted. Antibodies prepared to RHEX26 and tyrosine phosphorylated-RHEX26 confirmed strong EPO-induced phosphorylation; cell fractionation and Western blot studies demonstrated membrane residence of this 26 kDa phosphoprotein; and immunofluorescence microscopy showed sharp RHEX26 sub-localization as an integral plasma membrane protein. In functional analyses, lentiviral shRNA knockdown of RHEX26 proved to markedly inhibit the EPO-dependent expansion of erythroid progenitor cells (clonal colony-forming analyses demonstrated >80% specific inhibition), while effects on cell viability were limited. Mechanistically, RHEX26 is coupled (in part) to GRB2, with co-immunoprecipitation observed specifically upon EPO exposure, but without dependency on RHEX26 tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, genealogy analyses intriguingly indicate RHEX26 to be well-conserved only in H. sapiens and primates, while no ortholog is present in the rat, mouse, or zebrafish. RHEX26, as a novel EPO/EPOR 26 kDa target, therefore is proposed to comprise an important new Regulator of Human Erythroid eXpansion.
