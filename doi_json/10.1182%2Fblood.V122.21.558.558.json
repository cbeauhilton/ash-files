    "abstract_text": "Background Combination therapy with 3 cycles of chemotherapy followed by involved field radiotherapy has been a standard of care for treatment of localized diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Miller TP NEJM 1998). This population based study evaluated ethnic disparities in receipt of radiotherapy (RT) and its effect on survival in patients with localized diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the United States. Methods The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was reviewed to identify patients with stage I DLBCL diagnosed between 1998 and 2008. We used unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio (OR) to analyze association of receipt of radiotherapy with age (<60 and 60+ years), sex and ethnicity (White, Black and Others). We calculated relative survival rates for different cohorts using SEER*Stat software. We used cox\u2019s proportional hazard model to investigate the impact of age, sex and ethnicity on survival rates. Results A total of 11763 patients with localized DLBCL as the only primary malignancy were included in the study. Of the cohort, 38.2% received radiotherapy. Receipt of radiotherapy varied significantly by patient ethnicity - whites were more likely to receive RT compared to blacks and others. Similarly, age <60 years and females were more likely to receive radiotherapy compared with older patients and males ( Table \u2013 1 ).

Among patients who received RT, 1- and 5- year relative survival rates were significantly higher in whites compared to black or other- race patients. Conclusions This population based study showed that only 38.2% of patients with localized DLBCL received radiotherapy. White patients were more likely to receive RT compared to blacks and others. Survival rates are significantly higher for patients who received RT. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
