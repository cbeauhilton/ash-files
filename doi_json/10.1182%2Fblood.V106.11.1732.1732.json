    "abstract_text": "Transcription factor GATA-1 is essential at multiple stages of hematopoiesis. Murine gene targeting and analysis of naturally occurring human mutations demonstrate that GATA-1 is required for the maturation of committed erythroid precursors and megakaryocytes. Prior studies also suggest additional, poorly defined, roles for GATA-1 at earlier stages of erythro-megakaryocytic development. To investigate these functions further, we studied hematopoietic differentiation of Gata1 \u2212 murine embryonic stem cells on OP9 stroma with the cytokine thrombopoietin (TPO) present. Initially, the Gata1 \u2212 cultures generated a wave of mutant megakaryocytes, but these were rapidly overgrown by a unique population of TPO-dependent blasts that continued to proliferate for more than 6 months in culture. These immature Gata1 \u2212 cells arose reproducibly in culture without growth lag or crisis, indicating that they derive directly from loss of GATA-1 and not from random genetic events acquired during cell culture. The cells express transcription factors GATA-2, FOG-1 and PU.1 and exhibit the surface phenotype Lin \u2212 , Sca1 \u2212 , IL7R \u2212 , CD41 + , cKit + , CD9 + , and GPIb low . Importantly, upon restoration of GATA-1 function, these cells undergo both erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation, as assessed by morphology, ultrastructural analysis and the induction of lineage-specific markers. Clonal analysis shows that individual cells maintain the capacity for erythro-megakaryocytic differentiation. Hence, we term this unique population G1ME for G ata 1 \u2212 - M egakaryocyte- E rythroid. To determine if G1ME cells are present in vivo, we analyzed E13.5 fetal livers of Gata1 \u2212 /Gata1 wild-type chimeric embryos. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrates an expanded population of cells expressing the G1ME surface phenotype. Individual cells within this population also exhibit TPO-dependency, extensive proliferative capacity and GATA-1-dependent biphenotypic erythro-megakaryocytic maturation in vitro. Our findings indicate that the loss of GATA-1 impairs the maturation of a specific megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor. This defines a new role for GATA-1 at a relatively early stage of hematopoiesis and provides potential insight into recent discoveries that human GATA1 mutations promote acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), a clonal malignancy with features of both erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation.",
