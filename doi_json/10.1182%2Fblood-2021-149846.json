    "abstract_text": "Genomic studies in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have generated a near complete catalogue of genes mutated at varying frequencies both across patients and in individual leukemias. The high variability of mutation burden within a given leukemia is suggestive of a stepwise evolutionary process composed of early, clonal, mutations and subsequent subclonal events. The receptor tyrosine kinase, FLT3 , is the most commonly mutated gene in AML, with mutations frequently manifesting as internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the juxtamembrane domain leading to constitutive kinase activation. Although FLT3 is commonly a subclonal mutational event, FLT3 ITD mutations portend a poor prognosis particularly when combined with DNMT3A and NPM1 , earlier mutations that drive clonal expansion. Notwithstanding its role as a subclonal driver, previous preclinical FLT3 models have utilized retroviral overexpression or germline mutant expression at the endogenous locus precluding accurate temporal modeling of disease. These efforts have prohibited evaluation of FLT3 mutational acquisition in the context observed in AML patients. Here, we report the development of an endogenously targeted, Flp inducible, Flt3 ITD mouse allele which can be somatically activated subsequent to cooperating disease alleles. When activated with a tamoxifen inducible FlpoER, Flt3 mutant mice developed rapid leukocytosis peaking at 4-6 weeks post activation and resolving by 8-10 weeks, a finding not previously observed in constitutive models. This leukocytosis was disproportionately monocytic and accompanied by pronounced anemia and thrombocytopenia. Long term, these mice develop a myeloproliferative disease , reminiscent of previously reported constitutive alleles. In competitive transplantation studies, Flt3 mutant cells initiated disease and outcompeted wild-type cells. Despite this competitive advantage, disease was incapable of transplanting into secondary recipients. We further observed a non-cell autonomous depletion of SLAM+ LSKs suggesting the Flt3 mutant cells cannot propagate disease in self-renewing stem cells. To evaluate how this allele influenced leukemic evolution we crossed this Flt3 ITD allele to a Flp inducible Npm1 c mouse where a pulse of tamoxifen simultaneously activated both alleles. The combination of mutant Npm1 and Flt3 resulted in progressive leukocytosis which did not resolve. Within 6 weeks of mutational activation, these mice developed a lethal AML with robust anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis and expanded cKIT+ blasts in the blood. RNA-sequencing and immunophenotyping by CyTOF revealed distinct patterns of differentiation, gene-expression and downstream signaling.In an effort to model sequential mutational acquisition, we crossed the Flp Flt3 ITD allele to a Cre-inducible Dnmt3a R878H . Cre mRNA was electroporated into lineage negative bone marrow cells to activate the Dnmt3a R878H allele and transplanted into lethally irradiated recipients. Four weeks post engraftment, Flt3 ITD was activated with a pulse of tamoxifen. In contrast to the Flt3 - Npm1 model, we observed an increase and subsequent decrease in WBC similar to the kinetics observed in Flt3 ITD only mice. However, by 20 weeks we observed a robust and consistent increase in WBC accompanied by an emergence of cKIT+ cells in the blood. Histopathology indicated that >50% of mice expressing both alleles in sequence developed AML marked by increased blasts in the marrow, with moderate anemia and thrombocytopenia compared to the Flt3 - Npm1 models. Critically, in contrast to Flt3 ITD only mice, acquisition of the Flt3 ITD in Npm1 or Dnmt3a mutant HPSCs induced fully transplantable AML with immunophenotypic characteristics seen in human AML with these same genotypes. Collectively these results demonstrate that different co-occurring mutations are capable of transforming Flt3 ITD mutant cells, albeit with distinct latencies and mechanisms of cooperativity. In summary, our studies utilizing novel multi-recombinase models of leukemogenesis reveal new insights into the early phase of oncogene activation, and how cooperating alleles influence this response. This inducible Flt3 ITD allele represents a significant advance in modeling clonal evolution in myeloid malignancies and provides a critical isogenic platform for preclinical development of novel leukemia therapeutic regimens.
