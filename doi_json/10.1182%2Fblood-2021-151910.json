    "abstract_text": "Objective: To summarize the clinical nursing approach to CART treatment in one mycosis fungoides patient with generalized skin lesions, and to provide experience for reference in clinical nursing for such patients undergoing CART treatment. Method: Case Presentation: The patient, female, aged 43 years, was pathologically diagnosed to mycosis fungoides. Clinical state was tumor stage, as well TNMB stage was T4N3M0B1. The patient was admitted to the hospital with diffuse crimson papules, nodules, tumor, associated with brown, black pigmentation, complained of pruritus. The tumor surface ulcerated and oozing fluid at the surface of the head, bilateral cheeks, bilateral axillae, abdomen, right groin appeared infiltrated with flower like growth, the large of which was about 6x7 cm, and microorganism culture of secretory showed acinetobacter baumannii and corynebacterium striatum. Human derived CD4-CART treatment was given after chemotherapy pretreatment. The patient occurred severe granulocytic deficiency, fever, skin infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, respiratory failure, cardiac insufficiency, secondary hemophagocytic syndrome. Nursing strategy: 1. Strengthen basic care and application of sterile laminar flow beds. 2. Closely monitor physical signs, and discover early high fever, hypotension, low blood oxygen and other CRS reactions. 3. Special professional person conducted sterile dressing change to avoid cross infection; Perform weekly microorganism culture of secretory and adjust antibiotics symptomatically; Mechanical debridement and the use of debridement glue are given to the wound accompanied by yellow excoriation, black scab; Prevention of infection using fusidic acid cream, silver pyrimidine sulfate dressings, and hydrophilic silver containing dressings; Lesional wounds are covered with a lipidic hydrogel foam dressing to achieve wet healing. 4. Reinforce nutritional support and psychological care. Result: After the fusion of CAR T cells, the patient developed grade 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS), grade 0 ICANS. Fever appeared on the day 0 of fusion, the body temperature was up to 40.1\u2103. The fever sustained 16 days. No septic shock occurred; Hypoxemia was noted on day 4 after fusion to a minimum of 69% with invasive ventilator assisted breathing and life support given; On day 4 after fusion, the capillary leak syndrome occurred, and the systemic tumor and skin lesion were swollen compared with before, resulting in marked wound redness and oozing fluid. After active treatment, careful nursing with aseptic dressing change, the patient successfully passed through the CRS reaction period, and the lesional skin wound was completely repaired after 3 months. Conclusions: T cells are absent after CD4-CAR T cell therapy, and patients present with a state of immunodeficiency that predisposes to opportunistic infections. Severe patients with mycosis fungoides associated with systemic skin lesions treated with CART are prone to severe cytokine release syndrome, which can manifest as hyperthermia, severe agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and capillary leak syndrome, and may easily lead to more precancerous wounds. At this time, close observation of the changes in the life condition, active control of the CRS response, while supplemented with sterile debridement replacement, systemic symptomatic use of antibiotics, can reduce the incidence of infection, improve the safety of treatment, and ultimately promote the repair of tumor skin lesions wounds.
