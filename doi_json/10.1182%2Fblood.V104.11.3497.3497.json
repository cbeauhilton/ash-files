    "abstract_text": "Survivin is a unique member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, and its expression is regulated by p53. Recent identification of several functionally divergent survivin variants augments the complexity of survivin action as well as its regulation. Here we report that survivin-2B (retaining a part of intron 2 as a cryptic exon) is positively regulated by p53, and its overexpression plays a role in sensitizing leukemia cells to chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. Doxorubicin treatment activated p53, downregulated survivin and survivin-DEx3 but upregulated survivin-2B in EU-3, an acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cell line with wild type (wt)-p53 phenotype. In contrast, doxorubicin treatment failed to induce these alterations in EU-6 cells, a mutant-p53 ALL cell line. To specify the role of wt-p53 in regulating survivin and its variants, a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant plasmid p53\u2013143 was transfected into EU-4, a p53-null ALL cell line, to establish a subline EU-4/p53\u2013143. When EU-4/p53\u2013143 cell culture was shifted from 37.5\u00b0C to the wt-p53-permissive temperature (32.5\u00b0C), the expression of survivin and survivin-DEx3 was decreased whereas survivin-2B expression was increased, confirming the distinct regulatory effect of p53 on survivin and its variants. To clarify the role of survivin-2B in the process of apoptosis, survivin-2B cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3HA vector and transfected into EU-4 cells. Enforced expression of survivin-2B in EU-4 cells inhibited cell growth and sensitized these cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that survivin-2B variant is a pro-apoptotic factor and its expression is upregulated by p53."
