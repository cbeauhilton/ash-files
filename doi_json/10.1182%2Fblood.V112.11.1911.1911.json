    "abstract_text": "The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway regulates many cellular processes that are involved in tumor progression. Aberrant activation of the PI3K pathway due to an alteration of its elements like PTEN or Akt occurs quite frequently in malignant cells. Thus, inhibition of this pathway represents a promising option for the treatment of cancer patients. The best characterized PI3K inhibitors are LY294002 and wortmannin that were shown to disrupt downstream signaling and induce apoptotic cell death in tumor cells. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignancy mainly found in young children and elderly with constitutive activation of PI3K pathway. In our study we analyzed the effect of PI3K inhibition in cell lines deduced from ALL (Jurkat, BV173, SD1, T-2) and primary leukemic cells by incubating them with increasing concentrations of inhibitors of the PI3K signaling. We found that treatment of ALL cells with LY294002, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or Akt inhibitor SH5 induced apoptotic cell death that was accompanied by caspase-3 activation and PARP-cleavage and interfered with intracellular PI3K/Akt signaling as analyzed by phosphorylation and expression of mTOR or P70S6K. In line with these results apoptotic cell death could be inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD. In order to determine the pathway of apoptosis induction we took advantage of Jurkat cells (T-ALL) overexpressing or lacking molecules involved in apoptotic pathways such as FADD, an adaptor molecule recruited to the death receptor upon ligand binding, Caspase-8, Caspase-9 or Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein that prevents the release of cytochrom c from mitochondria. PI3K inhibition by LY294002 induced apoptotic cell death in cells deficient of FADD or caspase-8 with no difference to wild type cells. In contrast, cells overexpressing Bcl2 or lacking caspase-9 were resistant to apoptotic death indicating that PI3-kinase inhibition is independent of the external death receptor signaling and is mediated via the mitochondrial pathway. These results were confirmed by analyzing PARP cleavage and caspase-3 activation in utilized leukemic cell lines. Furthermore, we found that the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 induced apoptosis in ALL cells that could be increased by the etoposide, a topoisomerase inhibitor, or TRAIL. In addition, in contrast to etoposide, treatment of ALL cells with TRAIL could overcome the resistance of ALL cells to PI3K inhibition even in caspase-9 deficient Jurkat cells. Our results provide an interesting approach in designing novel therapeutic strategies to target the PI3K pathway in ALL to overcome the resistance to cytotoxic agents.",
