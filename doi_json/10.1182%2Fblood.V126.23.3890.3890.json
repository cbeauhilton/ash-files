    "abstract_text": "Chemokine receptors are G-protein-coupled cell surface receptors, which dissociate upon activation by their ligands and cause downstream signaling. Several studies have revealed the crucial contribution of chemokine receptors and their ligands in normal B-cell differentiation and development of hematopoietic malignancies. The Richter syndrome (RS) represents the clinico-pathologic transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) to an aggressive lymphoma, most commonly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Due to the lack of knowledge on the chemokine receptor, we aimed to investigate their expression profile in patients with CLL and Richter syndrome. Therefore, we investigated the mRNA expression levels of 18 known chemokine receptors (CCR1-CCR9, CXCR1-CXCR7, XCR1, CX3CR1) by using semi-quantitative real-time PCR on seven samples of paired (CLL and transformed DLBCL) RS samples, additionally four CLL samples -all of them subsequently transformed into DLBCL-, and eight transformed DLBCL samples originating from CLL. Additionally, 30 samples of de-novo DLBCL, including 10 germinal center B-cell (GCB) lymphomas, 12 non-germinal center B-cell lymphomas (non-GCB), and 8 unclassified DLBCL were included. Four samples of na\u00efve B-cells (CD5 neg), CD5+ na\u00efve B-cells and CD27+ memory B-cells (n=12) served as non-neoplastic controls. No differences in the chemokine receptor profile were detected between CD5+ and negative na\u00efve B-cells. When comparing CD27+ memory B-cells to na\u00efve B-cells a significant lower expression level was found for CCR7 (7-fold), CXCR4 (4-fold), and CXCR5 (1.5 fold). CCR7 (5-fold) and CXCR4 (5-fold) were also lower expressed in CD27+ memory B-cells compared to CD5+ na\u00efve B-cells. Five out of 18 chemokine receptors were differentially expressed comparing the distinct normal B-cell subsets with RS samples. Comparing CLL samples and RS samples to CD5+ na\u00efve B-cells, CXCR4 (12-fold for CLLs and 10-fold for RS samples) and CXCR5 (2-fold for CLLs and 2.4-fold for RS samples) were lower expressed, whereas CXCR3 (10-fold for CLLs and 8.5-fold for the transformed samples) was higher expressed and CCR5 de-novo expressed. Compared to na\u00efve B-cells, the same chemokine receptors were deregulated: CXCR4 (10-fold for CLLs and 8.5-fold for the RS samples) and CXCR5 (2-fold for CLLs and 2.4-fold for the transformed samples) were lower expressed, CXCR3 (45-fold for CLLs and 30-fold for the transformed samples) was higher expressed and CCR5 was de-novo expressed. Comparing CLL samples and transformed RS samples to CD27+ memory B-cells, CCR5 (5.1-fold for CLLs and 4.3-fold for the RS samples) and CCR7 (8.7-fold for CLLs and 10-fold for the transformed samples) were higher expressed in both malignancies. Only one chemokine receptor was found to be differentially expressed in our seven paired RS samples: CCR6 showed a trend of a higher expression (1.4-fold) in CLL components. Considering RS and GCB DLBCL, CCR1, CCR5, and CXCR6 were found to be significantly down-regulated in RS (at least 4-fold), in contrast to CCR7 and CXCR4, which showed higher expression levels in RS (6-fold). CCR1 and CCR5 were lower expressed comparing RS and non-GCB DLBCL (25-fold and 8-fold), whereas CCR7 again, together with CXCR7, was higher expressed (3- fold and 6-fold respectively). Our data indicate a difference in the chemokine receptor profile within normal B-cell subsets. These differences are also reflected in the different expression profile of low and high aggressive component of CLL/RS compared to the distinct B cell subtypes. Hence, in future these multiple deregulated CC and CXC receptors might serve as a further hint in identifying the cell of origin of different B-cell malignancies.
