    "abstract_text": "Background: At ASH 2004 and 2005, we reported < 20% rates of from accelerated approval (AA) to regular approval (RA) for drugs used to treat hematologic malignancies (HMs). The FDA convened Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) meetings with sponsors of these drugs in 2003 and 2005 outlining recommendations for completion of subpart H trials. Congressmen Markey and Hinchey have raised concern over low rates of completion of subpart H studies for all AA drugs. The Research on Adverse Drug Events and Reports (RADAR) project reviewed the current status of subpart H commitments for all cancer drugs that received AA prior to 2005. Methods: NDAs and supplements for new uses from the FDA, package inserts, and literature reviews were reviewed. Results: Of 19 cancer drugs receiving AA prior to 2005, conversion to RA has occurred for 2 of 9 drugs for HMs and 8 of 11 drugs for solid tumors (STs) (22% vs 73%, p 25,000 newly diagnosed patients annually (25% vs 78%). Recruitment targets are smaller for AA studies for HMs (median, 82 vs 295 patients) and subpart H studies (median, 295 vs 535). Conclusions: Rates of conversion from AA to RA remain poor for drugs for hematologic malignancies but not for solid tumors drugs. In spite of ODAC meetings and two congressional inquiries, little progress ahs been made towards completing these trials. RADAR continues to urge policy makers to modify the AA process for drugs used to treat hematologic malignancies.
