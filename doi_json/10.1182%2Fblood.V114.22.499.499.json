    "abstract_text": "Abstract 499 Introduction: CD56 + NK subsets exhibit differential NK receptors (NKR) such as cytotoxicity profiles including killer-Ig-like receptors (KIR), C-lectin (NKG2) and natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR) involved with tumor target recognition, which, in part, may play a role in adoptive cellular immunotherapy (ACI) for malignancies (Farag et al Blood , 2002). NK cell activation and NK mediated cytolysis is induced by triggering receptors such as NCR (i.e. NKp46), and NKG2 surface receptors like NKG2D (Moretta et al, Curr Opin in Immunol , 2004, Marcenaro et al, Eur J Immunol , 2003). The major limitations of the use of NK cells in ACI include lack of tumor recognition and/or limited numbers of viable and functionally active NK cells (Shereck/Cairo et al. PBC , 2007). To circumvent these limitations, methods to expand and activate PB NK cells by genetic reengineering have been developed (Imai/Campana et al. Blood , 2005). It has been demonstrated that PB NK cells expanded with modified K562 cells expressing membrane bound IL-15 and 4-1BBL (K562-mb15-41BBL; Imai et al Blood, 2005) are significantly increased in number and maintain heterogeneous KIR expression (Fusaki/Campana et al, BJH , 2009) .We have previously reported the ex-vivo expansion, activation and cytolytic activity of CB NK cells with a cocktail of antibody and cytokines (Ayello/Cairo et al, BBMT , 2006; Ayello/Cairo, Exp Hem , 2009, In Press). Objective: In this study, we compared CB NK expansion and activation following stimulation with genetically engineered K562 cells (K562-mb15-41BBL, generously supplied by D.Campana, St Jude's Children's Hospital, Memphis, TN) with wild-type (WT) K562 cells and NK cell characterization expressing inhibiting and activating KIRs, c-lectin, NCRs and NK cytolytic activation. Methods: Following irradiation with 100Gy, K562-mb15-41BBL or WTK562 were incubated at a 1:1 ratio with fresh CB MNCs at 37C, 5% CO 2 for 7 days in RPMI-1640+10IU IL-2. NKR expression (KIR2DS4, NKG2D, NKG2A, CD94, KIR3DL1, KIR2DL2, Nkp46) and LAMP-1 (CD107a) receptor expression and NK cell phenotype (CD56 dim and bright subsets) were determined by flow cytometry. Results: On Day 0, NK cells population was 3.9\u00b11.3%. After 7 days in culture, CB NK cells were significantly increased compared to WTK562 and media alone (72\u00b13.9 vs 43\u00b15.9 vs 9\u00b12.4%, p<0.01). This represented a 35-fold or 3374\u00b1385% increase of the input NK cell number. This was significantly increased compared to WTK562 (1771\u00b1300%, p<0.05). Concomitantly, there was a significant decrease in CB T cells vs WTK562 or media alone (15\u00b12 vs 36\u00b12 vs 51\u00b17%, p<0.001),respectively. There was a significant increase in CD56 bright vs CD56 dim populations (67 vs 33%, p<0.01) following stimulation with K562-mb15-41BBL. Also, there was a 10-fold increase in CB NK cells expressing KIR3DL1 following stimulation with K562-mb15-41BBL vs WTK562 (p<0.01) and a 5-fold increase in NK KIR2DS4 expression (p<0.05), respectively. There was a significant increase in the expression of NK activation marker, CD107a, compared to WTK562 (51\u00b10.7 vs 32\u00b11.1,p<0.05). There was no change in CB NK cell expression of the c-lectin receptor, CD94/NKG2A and CD94/NKG2D after stimulation with K562-mb15-41BBL. A standard cryopreserved CB unit (25 ml) contains approximately 750\u00d710 6 MNC. By using the smaller 5-ml aliquot (20%) of a two-aliquot bag (150\u00d710 6 MNCs \u00d7 3.9%=5.8\u00d710 6 NK cells), this expansion method would hypothetically yield 200\u00d710 6 CB NK cells after 7 days stimulation with K562-mb15-41BBL. Conclusion: These results suggest that CB MNC can be ex-vivo expanded with K562-mb15-41BBL resulting in specific expansion of CB NK cells with increased NK KIR expression (KIR2DS4 and KIR3DL1) and NK activation (CD107a), along with a significant decrease in CB T cells. This expansion provides a means to enhance specific CB NK cell expansion for possible use for adoptive cellular immunotherapy in the post UCBT setting Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
