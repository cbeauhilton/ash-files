Patients in the Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea (MSH), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of hydroxyurea (HU) treatment in sickle cell anemia, provided samples for genotyping. We examined the relationship between these markers and demographic characteristics; geographic distribution across MSH sites; HU treatment response; and pain outcomes including rate of painful crises; pain intensity; frequency of pain at home; frequency of at-home analgesic usage; frequency of medical contacts; and equianalgesic dosing at home and during hospital contacts. Patients and Methods: Subjects were n=299 patients enrolled in MSH. Patients came from 21 sites across 14 U.S. states and 1 Canadian province, with 5 to 57 enrolled at each site. The sample was almost equally males and females, ages 18 to 57 (with an average of 30) at entry, with a minimum of 3 painful crises in the previous year and a diagnosis of sickle cellanemia.Genetic markers examined were \u03b2-goblin haplotype (Central African Republic/CAR, Benin/BEN, Sengal /SEN, Cameroon /CAM, and atypical), X-linked loci, and \u03b1-globin genes. Patients kept two-week diaries in which they recorded daily pain levels on a 0-9 scale; whether or not they used opioids that day; and whether or not any unscheduled medical contacts took place. The use of specific opioids and the doses taken were recorded by providers at biweekly follow-up visits and also during medical contacts; these were converted into equianalgesic doses, which were used to obtain total and average daily doses for the two-week follow-ups and average daily doses for those medical contacts involving ER utilization or in-patient admission. Fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) was measured at baseline and again at 18-21 months after treatment initiation; \u2018responders' were defined as patients with Hb F levels below 15% at baseline but above 15% at 18-21 months (the 15% level was selected based on prior research and treatment recommendations). Results: The only sex difference found in relation to genetic markers was higher values for x-linkage in females ( p =.002). Geographically, sites were clustered into 2 regions (Northern/Southern) based on climate. The number of \u03b1-globin genes was higher in Northern sites than Southern ( p =.039); \u03b2-haplotypes and X-linkage did not differ across regions.HU treatment responders, shown elsewhere to have better outcomes in terms of painful crisis rates and other pain variables, differed significantly from nonresponders only in X-linkage ( p =.006), with stronger X-linkage associated with being a responder. For pain outcomes, there were no significant relationships between \u03b2-haplotypes or \u03b1-globin genes and rate of painful crises, average pain scores at home, the frequency of days with pain, days with analgesic use, or unscheduled medical visits. X-linkage was marginally ( p =.06) associated with medical visits; stronger x-linkage was associated with fewer medical visits. For equianalgesic dosing, significant associations were found with \u03b1-globin genes and the CAM haplotype. More \u03b1-globin genes were associated were lower at-home total and daily dosing and with lower daily doses of both oral and parenteral analgesics in hospital; however, further exploration by sex indicated that all of these associations were significant for males only (all p 's.05 for females). The presence of the CAM haplotype was associated with higher in-hospital oral and parenteral dosing and higher at-home total and daily dosing, but all associations were again significant for males only ( p 's<.05). Conclusions: Some genetic markers known to play a role in sickle cell disease were associated with classification as a treatment responder, pain-related outcomes, and equianalgesic dosing in the MSH cohort. However, when examined by sex, associations with equianalgesic dosing were statistically significant for males only. There is a need for further in-depth exploration of the role that genetic markers play in sickle cell pain outcomes, and in particular examination of possible sex differences and testing of potential explanations for those differences.
