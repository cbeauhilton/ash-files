    "abstract_text": "Background: Persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD) after induction, consolidation and salvage therapies is an independent poor prognostic marker in AML. The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment is a protective niche that promotes chemotherapy resistance of leukemia cells. This residual subset of chemotherapy-resistant cells present during remission eventually contributes to the leukemia relapse/persistence. Adhesion of AML cells to BM stroma is dependent on the CXCR4 receptor binding to its ligand CXCL12. High levels of CXCR4 expression correlate with poor survival in AML. It is postulated that blocking the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis will dislodge AML cells from the protective microenvironment and, when combined with chemotherapy, may improve the response to therapy. BL-8040 (BKT140) is a short peptide which inhibits the binding of CXCR4 to CXCL12, resulting in mobilization of leukemic blasts from the BM to the peripheral blood (PB). BL-8040 has strong affinity for the CXCR4 receptor with long receptor occupancy and as a single agent induces differentiation and apoptosis of leukemia cells in preclinical models. A clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of BL-8040 in combination with cytarabine (Ara-C) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory AML patients was recently completed (NCT01838395). Here we report results from correlative studies done on samples from patients who participated in this trial. Objective: To assess BL-8040 single agent anti leukemia effects in relapsed/refractory AML. Method: Patients received a once daily SC dose of BL-8040 monotherapy on days 1-2 followed by the same dose of BL-8040 plus Ara-C (1.5g/m 2 for patients \u226560; 3g/m 2 for patients <60) per day on days 3-7. Six dose levels of BL-8040 (0.5 - 2.0 mg/kg) were tested. PD parameters such as mobilization of leukemic blasts and induction of differentiation and apoptosis were assessed after monotherapy with BL-8040 using frequent PB sampling and BM aspirates at baseline and on day 3 prior to Ara-C administration. Results: 45 patients (including 3 receiving compassionate use BL-8040) with a median age of 61 yrs were treated. The majority of patients had poor risk disease with 24% secondary AML and 17% with prior allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Most patients were heavily pretreated with 19% relapsing after a short first remission (CR1 \u226412 months), 17% had \u22652 relapses and 45% refractory to 1-2 inductions. The CR+CRi rate was 38% in subjects receiving BL-8040 dose \u22651.0 mg/kg (n=39). Ongoing follow-up (FU) of responding patients (expansion phase; N=19) shows median EFS of 9.3 months (range 4.3-12.8 months). At the time of this analysis 10/19 patients are alive with a FU range of 0.96 - 12.8 months. FACS analysis revealed that BL-8040 monotherapy triggered an average 4.3-fold increase of immature AML blasts (CD45+Low/CD34+/CD117+/HLA-DR+) in PB (i.e., mobilization). Response to treatment was associated with more robust mobilization of AML blasts following BL-8040 monotherapy (responders 9.5 vs non-responders 1.7 fold median). Preferential mobilization of AML blasts over normal cells (4.7 fold vs. 1.4 fold, respectively) was confirmed by FISH analysis in a subset of patients with informative cytogenetic abnormalities. Induction of granulocytic differentiation of immature leukemia progenitors (2.5 fold) in the BM following BL-8040 monotherapy was noted. Finally, induction of AML blasts apoptosis (40% increase) by BL-8040 alone was evident by FACS in day 3 (pre-araC) bone marrow biopsies. Conclusions: The data demonstrate that sustained blockade of the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis with BL-8040 is safe and well tolerated and when given in combination with Ara-C improves the response rate achieved historically with Ara-C alone. In addition, treatment with BL-8040 as a single agent rapidly and efficiently induces mobilization, differentiation and cell death of AML blasts. This selective effect on chemotherapy-resistant cells may be translated into reduction of residual disease arguing for incorporation into front-line trials and such studies are ongoing.
