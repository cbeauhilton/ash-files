    "abstract_text": "The PIM kinases are a family of proteins recently identified as promising therapeutic targets in several cancers, including pancreatic, B-cell malignancies, acute leukemia, and prostate cancer among others. The family of PIM kinases is composed of three different members (PIM-1, -2, and -3) that are short-lived serine/threonine kinases involved in the regulation of a number of cellular pathways that are important for cancer cell growth and survival. The PIM kinases show high homology with each other, and exhibit functional redundancy in vitro and in vivo . Overexpression of PIM kinases promotes tumor growth through activation of several key cell-cycle progression and anti-apoptotic proteins, including BAD, p21, p27 KIP , c-Myc, and AKT-1. Recently, overexpression of PIM-2 has been shown to have a protective effect against ultraviolet light induced DNA damage (Zirkin et al. J Biol Chem 288:21770-83, 2013). We investigated the protective role of PIM kinases in chemotherapy-induced DNA damage, and whether inhibition of PIM kinases enhances anthracycline-induced DNA damage by inhibiting DNA repair, thus enhancing cell death in lymphoma cells lines. Using immunobloting and RT-PCR, we found similarly low levels of PIM-1 and PIM-3, but a wide range of PIM-2 expression, in a panel of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cell lines, including Raji, HS Sultan, Daudi, Farage, Granta519, and Toledo. Treatment of cells with doxorubicin (200-400 nM) resulted in up to a five fold increase gene transcription and expression of PIM-1 and PIM-2, which was maximal at 6 hours, and was associated with an increase in DNA damage as detected using acridine orange flow cytometry assay. We also tested the single agent effect of the pan-PIM kinase inhibitor, CX6258 on the cell lines. CX6258 alone inhibited cell growth in all NHL cell lines with varying degrees of potency with IC 50 ranging from 0.2 \u2013 12.9 \u00b5M. The anti-cancer was associated most with PIM-2 expression, with the most sensitive cell lines, Daudi and Toledo, expressing the most PIM-2. Suppression of PIM-2 expression by shRNA significantly decreased proliferation, indicating that PIM-2 is a significant factor in cell growth. Treatment of NHL cells with CX6258 resulted in increased caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage, decreased BAD phosphorylation, and apoptosis. Treatment with CX6258 also increased expression of p21, decreased expression of cyclins A1 and B1, and induced G2-M cell cycle arrest. The effect of combinations of CX6258 (5-50 \u00b5M) and doxorubicin (50-500 nM) on DNA damage and cell death was tested on HS sultan and Daudi cells. While doxorubicin alone resulted in a two-fold increase in DNA damage, this was significantly increased in the presence of CX6258 (12 fold). The addition of CX6258 inhibited the phosphorylation of the DNA repair proteins H2.AX, ATM, and Chk2 that occurred when the cells were treated with doxorubicin alone. The combination of CX6258 and doxorubicin was synergistic in inducing lymphoma cell death, with combination indexes ranging from 0.32-0.85. Our findings suggest a mechanism for synergy where doxorubicin damages cellular DNA and initiates the DNA damage response, while CX6258 inhibits the upregulated PIM kinases from activating the proteins involved in the response. This synergistic anti-tumor activity is further strengthened by the CX6258 inhibition of cell cycle progression and anti-apoptotic proteins activated by the PIM kinases. Taken together, our results provide pre-clinical rationale for clinical testing of PIM kinase inhibitors in combination with doxorubicin in patients with NHL. It also suggests that CX6258 may similarly enhance the anti-cancer effects of other DNA damaging agents. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
