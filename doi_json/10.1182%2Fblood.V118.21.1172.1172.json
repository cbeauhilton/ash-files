    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1172 Equilibrium dialysis experiments indicate that the Gla domain of coagulant protein factor (F) VIIa and of anticoagulant protein C (PC) each bind seven Ca 2+ in the absence and four in the presence of physiologic Mg 2+ (0.6 mM). The previous x-ray structure of FVIIa/soluble (s) tissue factor (TF) in the presence of 5 mM Ca 2+ /45 mM Mg 2+ (5Ca/45Mg) (Bajaj et al., J Biol Chem, 281, 24873\u201324888, 2006) revealed that sites 2,3,5 and 6 were occupied by Ca 2+ while sites 1, 4 and 7 contained Mg 2+ (Tulinsky numbering, Biochemistry 31, 2554\u20132566, 1992). Since these concentrations of metal ions were supraphysiologic, we sought to obtain crystals under concentrations of Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ approaching those found in blood. We have solved the structures of FVIIa/sTF under three new conditions: 2.5 mM Ca 2+ /1.25 mM Mg 2+ at 2.8 A\u030a (2.5Ca/1.25Mg); 5 mM Ca 2+ /2.5 mM Mg 2+ at 1.8 A\u030a (5Ca/2.5Mg); and 45 mM Ca 2+ /5 mM Mg 2+ at 1.7 A\u030a (45Ca/5Mg). For 2.5Ca/1.25Mg, the Gla domain of FVIIa was disordered indicating insufficient concentrations of Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ to fold the Gla domain. Interestingly, folding of the \u03a9-loop for 5Ca/2.5Mg was similar to that reported under 5Ca/45Mg, with identical positions for four Ca 2+ and three Mg 2+ . In contrast, while the folding of the \u03a9-loop at 45Ca/5Mg was similar to that reported only in the presence of Ca 2+ (Banner et al., Nature, 380, 41\u201346,1996); however, positions 1 and 7 contained Mg 2+ ( Fig. 1 A). Thus, it would appear that four Ca 2+ and three Mg 2+ ions are bound to the circulating FVII/FVIIa. Moreover, circulating FVII/FVIIa will need high Ca 2+ concentrations to have its position four switched from Mg 2+ to Ca 2+ . Fig. 1.

B) The superimposed structures of Gla domain in FVIIa (45Ca/5Mg) and in 5Ca/5Mg PC-EPCR (1.6 A\u030a) showing similar \u03a9-loop conformations.  All seven metal sites in the structure of PC-Gla complexed to endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) had been refined with Ca 2+ despite the presence of 5 mM Ca 2+ and 5 mM Mg 2+ in the crystallization buffer (Oganesyan et al., J Biol Chem, 277, 24851\u201324854, 2002). Based on our findings with VIIa/sTF, we revisited the PC-Gla/EPCR structure. We determined that positions 1 and 7 are Mg 2+ sites while 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are Ca 2+ sites in the PC-Gla/EPCR structure ( Fig. 1 B). This contrasts to four Ca 2+ and three Mg 2+ bound to VIIa/TF at 5Ca/2.5Mg. Since five Ca 2+ and two Mg 2+ were seen in VIIa/sTF at 45Ca/5Mg, it would appear that position 4 can accommodate either Ca 2+ or Mg 2+ depending upon conditions. We propose that at near physiologic Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ , ligation of the Gla domain with EPCR and possibly phospholipid (PL) membranes facilitates substitution of the Mg 2+ bound at the position four with Ca 2+ . This metal switch may be essential to achieve a favorable conformation of the Gla domain \u03a9-loop for optimal ligand of PL binding. Mg 2+ also enhanced the Ca 2+ -dependent interaction of FVIIa or activated protein C (APC) to PL assessed by surface plasmon resonance. Binding of FVIIa and APC each was saturated by the physiological concentration of Ca 2+ (1.1 mM) in the presence of physiological Mg 2+ (0.6 mM). In contrast, only half-saturable binding was observed at the physiological concentration of Ca 2+ in the absence of Mg 2+ . Further, 0.6 mM Mg 2+ potentiated (\u223c2.5-fold) the PL-dependent activation of FX by FVIIa/TF at 1.1 mM Ca 2+ . Similarly, Mg 2+ potentiated (\u223c3-fold) the activation of FX by FVIIa/TF assembled on the endotoxin-stimulated monocyte surface. PL-dependent inactivation of FVa by APC was also enhanced \u223c3-fold by 0.6 mM Mg 2+ at 1.1 mM Ca 2+ . At saturating Ca 2+ (5 mM), the activation of FX by FVIIa/TF or the inactivation of FVa by APC was similar to that with 1.1 mM Ca 2+ /0.6 mM Mg 2+ . Thus Mg 2+ at physiologic concentrations augments PL- or natural membrane-dependent coagulation and anticoagulation at the plasma concentration of Ca 2+ . We propose that vitamin K-dependent clotting and anti-clotting proteins circulate in blood with four Ca 2+ ions bound. The remaining three (or more in FIX and FX) divalent metal binding sites in each Gla domain are occupied by Mg 2+ . The conformation of the \u03a9-loop in circulating vitamin K- dependent proteins is not favorable for binding to PL but it is achieved by switching Mg 2+ at position four to Ca 2+ . Thus, the metal ion at position four regulates PL-dependent coagulation and anticoagulation reactions. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
