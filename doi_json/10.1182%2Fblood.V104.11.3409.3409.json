    "abstract_text": "A prominent feature of most cancers including multiple myeloma (MM) is a striking genetic instability, leading to ongoing accrual of mutational changes some of which underlie tumor progression, including development of drug resistance and metastasis. The molecular basis for the generation of genetic diversity in cancer cells has thus emerged as an important focus of investigation and a target for successful eradication. We have previously observed that homologous recombination (HR) is upregulated in MM. Utilizing a genomewide LOH assay based on SNP genotyping (Affymetrix) as a tool to estimate the rate of mutation and genomic instability, we have observed that over time elevated HR leads to progressive accumulation of genetic variation in MM cell lines and patient cells; and inhibition of HR activity in MM cells by altering components of the HR pathway concordantly affects the acquisition of new genetic changes. As HR activity is dependent on concerted action of number of genes, instead of over expressing single HR related gene, we utilized nickel chloride, a known recombinogen to evaluate effects of increased HR activity on the development of genomic diversity. We cultured ARP cells in the presence or absence of nickel chloride, over a period of 90 days. Genome-wide LOH was evaluated by comparing genotypes before and after the 90-day interval. In three independent experiments treatment of cells with nickel chloride increased the number of new LOH sites by more than 12-fold. We next evaluated the effect of induction of HR and the consequent increase in genetic aberrations, on development of drug resistance in MM. Myeloma cells were cultured with nickel chloride as a potent inducer of HR and dexamethasone (10 \u22128 M); control cells were exposed to dexamethasone alone. The cell viability was measured weekly. No live cells were detected in cultures exposed to dexamethasone alone; while >95% cells exposed to both nickel chloride and dexamethasone were alive following 2 weeks culture. These findings were confirmed by 3 independent experiments. The development of drug resistance was further confirmed by demonstrating no significant effects of dexamethasone on these cells at 10 \u22126 M concentrations for >1 week. Dexamethasone at this concentration kills all control cells by day 3. Evaluation of development of resistance to other agents is underway. We propose that continued accumulation of new genetic changes mediated by HR, as demonstrated here, provides the molecular events required to develop drug resistance; and its inhibition may allow us to successfully treat MM cells without the currently observed development of resistance. HR may be a potential therapeutic target to maintain chemo sensitivity of the tumors.",
