    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1422 Background: Imatinib Mesylate (IM) used in the treatment of CML, interacts with membrane efflux transporters such as ABCB1 and ABCG2, whereas the active uptake of IM into the cells is mediated by SLC22A1. The predictive value of these markers is still controversial. The altered expression of these genes could impact on intracellular concentration of IM and contribute to resistance. Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate ABCB1, ABCG2 and SLC22A1 gene expression as potential sources of resistance to imatinib in patients with CML Methods: One hundred and eighteen patients in chronic phase of CML, both genders with age range 18 to 80 were studied. All patients were initially treated with a standard dose of IM (400 mg/day) and divided in two groups according to response. The responder group comprised 70 patients who had a complete cytogenetic response within 18 months of treatment. The non-responder group comprised 48 patients who did not have a complete cytogenetic response with the initial dose (400 mg/day) of IM or who relapsed during treatment and were submitted to higher doses of 600 or 800 mg/day. Criteria of failed response to treatment were established by European LeukemiaNet. Patients with cytogenetic patterns other than the Philadelphia chromosome and patients with mutations in the BCR-ABL1 gene were excluded from this study. Major molecular response (MMR) was defined as a reduction of BCR-ABL1 transcripts levels to \u2264 0.1% in the peripheral blood standardized on the International scale. Complete molecular response (CMR) was defined as a reduction \u2264 0.032% BCR-ABL1 transcripts levels. Primary resistance and secondary resistance also were evaluated. Real-Time PCR was performed to evaluate the ABCB1, ABCG2 and SLC22A1 mRNA relative expression to control gene GAPDH. Results: Expression of ABCG2 in the non-responder group was higher than in the responder group (P=0.028). This result was influenced by patients with primary resistance (n= 34 p=0.029) but not secondary resistance (n=14 p=0.249) when compared with responders (n=70). ABCB1 and SLC22A1 expression were similar between responder and non-responder groups. Higher levels of SLC22A1 mRNA were found in patients who achieved MMR in the responder group (p=0.009). The elevated ABCG2 expression was also found in those who did not achieve MMR (p=0.027) when all patients were analyzed. None of studied genes was associated with CMR. Conclusions: The high expression of ABCG2 is related to primary resistance and SLC22A1 is positively associated with major molecular response to treatment with IM. Our data suggests that ABCG2 may be a mediator of IM resistance, whereas SLC22A1 could be a good predictor of response to IM therapy.
