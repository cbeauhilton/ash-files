    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is characterized by an accumulation of CD19+ CD5+ CLL cells in the peripheral blood and the lymphoid compartments. The disease is still incurable despite recent advances in the development of novel therapy concepts (e.g. inhibitors of BCR signaling). Although it is not entirely clear how CLL develops, proliferation centers located in the lymph node and the bone marrow are thought to be the crucial niche that provides the surrounding in which CLL cells originate and re-establish the clone after therapy, leading to relapse in almost 100% of CLL patients. In analogous normal lymphoproliferative environments the transcription factor IRF4 plays an important role in controlling B cell maturation, differentiation, proliferation and survival. A SNP in the human IRF4 3\u2019UTR was linked to CLL susceptibility (DiBernardo Nat.Gen. 2008) and in the mouse model germline deletion of IRF4 in all lineages contributed to CLL development in the New Zealand Black and in the VH11 mouse model (Shukla Blood 2013, Ma J.Biol.Chem. 2013). Methods: CLL samples were collected from the peripheral blood of CLL patients according to the Declaration of Helsinki and with written informed consent. IRF4 mRNA expression analyses were performed in purified CD19+ CLL cells using TaqMan Real Time PCR. In vitro studies were performed in soloculture without stimulation or in coculture systems mimicking the lymph node microenvironment, as previously described (Asslaber Br.J.Haematol. 2013). IRF4 knockdown was performed using lipofection and IRF4 specific siRNAs or non-targeting control siRNAs. IRF4 protein expression was measured by intracellular flow cytometry. Proliferation was detected by Ki-67 intracellular staining. All intracellular stainings were performed after gating on viable CD19+ CD5+ CLL cells. Cell death was assessed by Annexin V / 7AAD staining or using a fixable viability dye. Results: Overall, IRF4 mRNA expression was decreased in CLL patients (N=101) when compared to healthy donors (N=8, P=0.04). In the CLL cohort low IRF4 mRNA expression (cut-off determined by ROC analysis and Youden Index calculation) was significantly correlated with earlier time to treatment (median treatment-free survival: 40 month in the IRF4 LOW and 69 month in the IRF4 HIGH CLL patient group (P<0.01)). This was proved to be independent of mutation state and other CLL risk factors in multivariate analysis. Using in vitro knockdown of IRF4 in solo- and coculture models we found that lowered expression of IRF4 was associated with increased CLL cell survival and abrogated spontaneous apoptosis (N=11, P<0.01). Moreover, we detected a failure of CLL cells to respond to CD40L signals derived from the microenvironment after IRF4 knockdown, which was associated with abrogated proliferation (N=9, P<0.01). Indeed microenvironmental stimuli (e.g. CD40L ligation or addition of activated T cells) were required to maintain IRF4 expression in vitro (N=17, P < 0.001) which also corresponds to our observation that IRF4 positive CLL cells were highly overrepresented in the CXCR4 dim CD5 bright CLL population (N = 55, P < 0.0001) which is considered to be the proliferative CLL cell fraction emigrated from the lymph node (Calissano Mol. Med. 2011). Conclusion : We demonstrate that low IRF4 expression is an independent negative prognostic marker for CLL progression. In the microenvironmental context IRF4 plays a dual role, with high expression limiting CLL survival on the one hand but being a crucial mediator of CD40L mediated proliferation on the other hand. While our data suggest that IRF4 is upregulated in response to microenvironmental stimuli the association of low IRF4 levels with bad prognosis suggests that IRF4 levels may serve to limit CLL growth by enhancing cell death responses. The exact mechanisms by which IRF4 impacts CLL pathophysiology is currently being investigated in vivo using B-cell specific IRF4-deficient CLL mouse models.
