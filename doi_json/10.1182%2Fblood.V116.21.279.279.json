    "abstract_text": "Abstract 279 Transgenic mice which express the fusion gene NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) have been shown to develop characteristic features of Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) including impaired hematopoietic differentiation and peripheral blood cytopenias in the presence of normocellular or hypercellular bone marrow (BM). It is evident that B-cells play a role in the progression of MDS by immune modulation or as direct targets of mutations resulting in ALL, or as cells that influence the BM microenvironment in which a neoplastic myeloid clone evolves. Choi and colleagues suggested a block in differentiation during the early development of B lymphocytes in the BM of NHD13 mice leading to lymphopenia consistent with the observation in some MDS patients. In this study, we sought to further delineate the role of NHD13 on B lymphocytes which escaped the initial differentiation block in the BM. We hypothesized that NHD13 impairs maturation and function of IgM + B lymphocytes contributing to immunodeficiency. To study this, we performed blood smear examination, Complete Blood Counts (CBC), quantitative ELISA for antibody concentrations, and flow cytometric analysis of B cell fractions from the BM and spleen in 8\u201312 week-old transgenic and wild type (WT) mice. CBCs revealed significant lymphopenia and ELISA showed higher IgM concentrations (n=10, p<0.001), reduced levels of IgG1 (n=10, p<0.05) and IgE (n=10, p<0.01). The IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3 antibody levels were comparable to WT counterparts. Flow cytometric analysis of BM and splenic B cell fractions revealed reduced numbers of B cells in Hardy fractions D and F (n=10, p<0.01) indicative of impaired differentiation prior to these stages; splenic fractions in NHD13 mice were comparable to WT controls. Next, to assess the peripheral maturation and functional efficiency of B lymphocytes in the context of a comprehensive immune stimulation, a cohort of five WT and five preclinical transgenic mice were injected with 100 \u03bc g dinitrophenol (DNP) followed by a booster dose on day 21. Mice were euthanized on day 28 and whole blood, spleen, lymphnodes and BM were harvested. CBC evaluation revealed significant lymphopenia in NHD13 mice (n=5, p<0.001). Quantitative ELISA for DNP specific antibodies showed comparable levels of serum IgM and significantly reduced levels of serum IgG1 (n=5, p<0.001), IgG2a (n=5, p<0.001), IgG2b (n=5, p<0.01), IgG3 (n=5, p<0.001) and IgE (n=5, p<0.01). Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood showed reduced numbers of B220 + IgM + B cells (n=5, p<0.01), but comparable percentages of CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells. Detailed flow cytometric analysis of B-cell fractions in the BM and spleen of DNP-stimulated mice revealed a reduction in subpopulations of B lymphocytes. The earliest B cell lineage population, Pre-Pro B, was comparable to the WT controls. Hardy Pro B fraction B (n=5, p<0.001) and Pre B fractions E (n=5, p<0.01) and F (n=5, p<0.01) from BM of stimulated mice were significantly reduced in contrast to fractions C and C', which were higher (n=5, p<0.05 and p<0.001 respectively), indicative of cell growth arrest at these stages. Flow cytometry of splenic B-cell fractions from the DNP-stimulated mice showed significantly lower Transitional 1 (n=5, p<0.01), Follicular (n=5, p<0.05) and Marginal Zone (n=5, p<0.001) populations upon antigenic stimulation suggestive of defective clonal expansion of IgM + cells even after escaping the block in the BM. Histopathology of the spleen revealed smaller lymphoid follicles with poorly developed mantle and marginal zone regions in the transgenic mice when compared to WT controls, consistent with the flow cytometric data. This study indicates that when NHD13 mice are immunologically challenged, B lymphocytes undergo impaired differentiation in the BM and maturation in the spleen, as well as reduced antibody class switching and subsequently lower antibody production. Analysis of B cell subsets during development and specific IgG/IgE antibody production, suggest that the NHD13 transgene might impair VDJ gene recombination and class switch recombination that are critical during these phases of B cell development.
