    "abstract_text": "Introduction It is currently well-known that B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients have an impaired immune function -particularly in advanced disease-, which significantly contributes to a higher risk of infections. The introduction of new effective therapeutic agents, such as the purine analogues (or alkylating agents with concomitant properties of purine analogues) plus anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, have significantly increased the rate of complete responses in CLL, but so far their impact on the overall immune function and the spectrum of infections occurring in CLL patients after therapy, remains to be fully understood. Aim To evaluate the effect of the number of treatment lines received on the different normal circulating leucocyte cell populations, including normal B-cell subsets, in advanced-stage treated CLL. Material and Methods The distribution of peripheral blood (PB) leukocytes was analyzed in 85 untreated CLL patients, and compared to that of 63 patients who had previously been treated with 1 line of treatment (n=39) or >1 line of treatment (n=24), and who failed to respond. Analysis was performed by 8-color flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, TCRgd, CD19, CD20, CD27, CD38, CD45, CD56, sIgM, sIgA, sIgG, sIgLambda and sIgKappa. Results The absolute count of circulating malignant B cells was not significantly different (p>0.05) in the untreated vs. previously treated patients who received 1 or >1 line of treatment (77,627\u00b184,211 vs 67,994\u00b172,087 vs 59,282\u00b174,206 cells/uL; respectively). In contrast, as compared to untreated patients, PB normal B cells were found to be reduced in patients who had received either 1 line or >1 line of treatment (89\u00b1142 vs 36\u00b157 and 23\u00b132 cells/uL, p=0.004 and p0.05). When dissecting the normal B-cell subsets, therapy-related decreased B-cell numbers were mostly due to a reduced number of circulating memory B cells (67\u00b198 vs 21\u00b145 and 15\u00b126 cells/uL; p=0.001 and p0.05) and na\u00efve (16\u00b155 vs 6\u00b118 and 4\u00b18 cells/uL; p>0.05) B cells, nor for circulating plasma cells (3\u00b118 vs 5\u00b121 and 2\u00b16 cells/uL; p>0.05), regardless of the therapy status. As compared to untreated patients, the absolute count of CD4+ T cells and CD4/CD8 double negative TCR\u03b1\u03b2 cells were significantly lower in patients with >1 line of treatment (1,836\u00b11,340 vs 1,256\u00b11,027 and 131\u00b1165 vs 56\u00b197 cells/uL, p=0.03 and p=0.007 respectively) but not in those who had received only 1 line (1,477\u00b11,349 and 201\u00b1747 cells/uL; p>0.05). In contrast, therapy did not show a significant impact on the absolute count of PB T CD8+ and TCRgd cells. No statistically significant differences were observed in the number of PB innate immune subpopulations including, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, NK cells and dendritic cells. Conclusions While there are no differences regarding the number of leukemic cells, previously treated patients have significantly reduced counts of total and memory (all isotypes) normal B-cell subsets when compared to untreated patients. Together with this, CD4+ helper T cells could also be compromised after more than 1 line of treatment. Monitoring of these therapy-related immune defects could contribute to a better management of infectious complications in advanced-stage CLL patients.
