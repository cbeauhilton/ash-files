    "abstract_text": "The effect of time from diagnosis to treatment (TDT) on overall survival of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain obscure. Furthermore, whether chemotherapy delay impacts overall survival (OS) of patients with a special molecular subtype has not been investigated. Here, we enrolled 364 cases of AML to assess the effect of TDT on OS by fractional polynomial regression in the context of clinical parameters and genes of FLT3 ITD, NPM1 , CEBPA , DNMT3a , and IDH1 / 2 mutations. Results of the current study show IDH1/2 mutations are associated with older age, M0 morphology, an intermediate cytogenetic risk group, and NPM1 mutations. TDT associates with OS for AML patients in a nonlinear pattern with a J shape. Moreover, adverse effect of delayed treatment on OS was observed in patients with IDH1/2 mutations, but not in those with IDH1/2 wild type. Therefore, initiating chemotherapy as soon as possible after diagnosis might be a potential strategy to improve OS in AML patients with IDH1/2 mutations.
