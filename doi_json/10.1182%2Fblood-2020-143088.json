    "abstract_text": "Background: Autologous CAR T cell therapy targeting the B-cell specific surface antigen CD19 has demonstrated favorable clinical responses in relapsed or refractory (R/B) B-cell lymphomas (BCL). However, despite 40-60% initial complete response (CR) rates, only a subset of patients experience durable remissions, and there is a need to further improve the efficacy of CAR therapies by preventing relapse and attaining a deeper CR. We hypothesized that the redundancy of CD28 and CD3V signaling in a CAR design incorporating all 3 CD3Vimmunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) might foster counterproductive T cell differentiation and exhaustion, and therefore created a new CD19 CAR construct with calibrated CAR activation potential by mutating 2 of the 3 ITAMs, termed 1XX. In systemic ALL mouse models, 19-28z1XX CAR induced effective tumor eradication at low CAR T cell doses with improved survival compared to conventional 19-28z CAR. Further preclinical studies demonstrated that the enhanced therapeutic benefit resulted from the reduced strength of activation mediated by the 19-28z1XX CAR, achieving a favorable balance of effector and memory functions, thereby enhancing persistence of functional CAR T cells and promoting effective elimination of CD19+ leukemia at lower T cell doses than needed with 19-28z CAR T cells (Feucht J et al . Nat Med 2019). To further improve the persistence of functional CAR T cells, we screened different humanized CD19-directed scFv in the context of a 19-28z1XX CAR design and proved high specificity and functionality of 19-28z1XX CARs containing a novel humanized scFv T2 - termed 19(T2)28z1XX. Study Design and Methods: This study is a single center Phase I clinical trial of 19(T2)28z1XX in patients with R/R B-cell malignancies at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (NCT04464200). Key disease eligibility criteria include R/R diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high grade BCL, primary mediastinal BCL, indolent BCL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Patients with prior CD19 CAR therapies are eligible as long as expression of CD19 is confirmed. Key exclusion criteria include ongoing immunosuppression such as systemic GvHD therapy and active CNS disease. The study uses a 3+3 dose-escalation design to identify the maximum tolerated dose for BCL. There are 5 planned flat-dose levels. Patients will receive conditioning chemotherapy consisting of 3 days of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed by a single infusion of 19(T2)28z1XX CAR T cells. In the dose-escalation phase, patients with DLBCL, high grade BCL, and primary mediastinal BCL are eligible to participate. Once the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined, the study will open to dose expansion phase with two cohorts. Cohort 1 includes DLBCL, high grade BCL and primary mediastinal BCL ( i.e. same eligibility criteria as the dose-escalation phase). Cohort 2 will include patients with indolent BCL, CLL, and Richter's transformation. The dose-expansion part of the trial is designed to further characterize the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of 19(T2)28z1XX CAR in multiple indications. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate safety and tolerability and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of 19(T2)28z1XX. Key secondary objectives include evaluation of 19(T2)28z1XX's efficacy and cellular kinetics. Exploratory objectives include assessment of B cell aplasia, and analysis of serum cytokines. The trial has begun enrollment in August 2020. The investigators are hopeful this study will lead to development of improved CD19 CAR T cell therapy with enhanced efficacy and favorable toxicity profiles with lower infused T cell dose.
