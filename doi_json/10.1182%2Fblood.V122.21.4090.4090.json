    "abstract_text": "Introduction Myelofibrosis (MF) and Post PV/ET MF represents a group of debilitating hematological disorders in which quality of life (QOL) is severely compromised in most patients as a result of persistent constitutional symptoms, progressive cytopenias, and splenomegaly. Conventional therapeutic modalities have largely focused on symptoms palliation rather than cure. Allogeneic stem cell transplantion (ASCT) remains the only potential curative option for intermediate and high risk disease. Till now, outcome data for MF have historically focused on survival benefit. Until now, few studies have evaluated the QOL, financial burden, and symptom response in MF patients undergoing treatment including ASCT. The development of the Myeloproliferative Symptom Assessment Form Total Symptom (MPN-SAF TSS) score in 2012 allows us to objectively quantify with a standardized tool these crucial aspects of patients care. The Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Quality of Life (MPN-QOL) Study Group aims to objectively quantify symptomatic response to standard available treatments by utilizing the MPN-SAF TSS. We introduce two MPN-QOL prospective trials currently in active enrollment: The MPN Experimental Assessment of Symptoms by Utilizing Repetitive Evaluation (MEASURE) Trial and the Symptoms Yielded in Myelofibrosis Patients after Transplant as Objectified by MPN-SAF TSS (SYMPTOMS) Trial. Our intention with these studies is to quantify the QOL and symptom burden of PMF and post PV/ET MF patients undergoing treatment including ASCT. Methods The MEASURES trial is a prospective questionnaire based study evaluating the responsiveness of the MPN-SAF TSS in detecting symptomatic changes in target symptoms for an anticipated 180 ET, PV and MF (including primary MF, post-ET and post PV MF) patients receiving non-experimental medical therapy (aspirin, hydroxyurea, anagrelide, interferon, busulfan, melphalan, cladribine, thalidomide, lenalidomide, prednisone, danazol, ruxolitinib) and/or phlebotomy. Patients complete the MPN-SAF for seven consecutive days at the time of enrollment and repeat the survey for an additional seven consecutive days between 90 days and six months. Patients also complete the MDASI, EORTC and Global Impression of Change Items on the first day of the second assessment. Physicians acquire demographic, laboratory, physical examination and radiographic data, along with serial response assessments. In parallel, the SYMPTOMS trial is prospective questionnaire based study evaluating the QOL of patients undergoing ASCT utilizing MPN-SAF TSS, the FACT-BMT, Global Impression of Change, and a financial questionnaire. Patients will be evaluated at various time points pre-transplant, day 30, day 100 and 1 year post-transplant. Participants (N=110) will be prospectively enrolled from Mayo Clinic Arizona (MCA) with other centers to soon join. To date we have enrolled 5 patients from MCA on the SYMPTOMS trial and 32 patients on the MEASURES trial. Results Both trials began open enrollment in the summer of 2012 and remain in recruitment phase. Our updated preliminary data will be presented at the ASH 2013 meeting Conclusion Myeloproliferative Neoplasms have been associated with debilitating symptom profile that can significantly impair the QOL. We recognize the burden of this disease and treatment and have therefore initiated two ongoing parallel prospective trials with goals to quantify the QOL and symptom burden of MPN patients. By quantifying degree of burden and impairment in QOL in a standardized format in MPN patients undergoing a range of treatments, we will in the future be better able to inform our patients of the likely benefits and toxicities of the available treatment options.
