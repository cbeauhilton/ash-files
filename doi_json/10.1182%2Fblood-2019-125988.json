    "abstract_text": "Secreted and transmembrane (TM) proteins play key roles in malignant transformation and tumor growth, including autocrine growth factor expression, receptor oncogene signal transduction pathways, metastasis, and immune system evasion. During translation, the majority of such proteins require translocation through the Sec61 translocon into the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) for further processing. This process is negotiated by unique signal sequences of the translating protein. Therefore, Sec61 represents a novel therapeutic target for cancer treatment through selective blockade of protein secretion. We generated Sec61 inhibitors and assessed their potential against target proteins using HEK293 cell lines stably expressing secreted or TM proteins of interest fused to a luciferase reporter. Additionally, anti-tumor activity was determined across both solid and liquid tumor cell lines in vitro and in mouse models. KZR-8834, a lead candidate identified through a medicinal chemistry campaign, induced cell death in multiple tumor cell lines in vitro , including multiple myeloma (MM), and was effective in xenograft models at doses that did not induce significant body weight loss or clinical signs of toxicity. We utilized quantitative proteomic methods to study KZR-8834 for inhibition of protein secretion and global modulation of protein homeostasis in sensitive and resistant tumor cell lines. Multiple tumor cell types were tested at various doses and time courses followed by subcellular fractionation of cytosolic and membrane/ER proteomes. Subsequent proteomic profiling was performed with Stable Isotope Labeling by/with Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC) and/or Tandem Mass Tag 6-plex (TMT-sixplex). Sensitive targets from both proteomes were further verified using downstream biochemical methods. Sec61 client proteins showed both time- and dose-dependent inhibition upon compound treatment and proteomic results were verified via western blot analysis. Approximately 20% of the total Sec61 clientome and 25% of total proteins detected in a sensitive multiple myeloma (MM) cell line, H929, were significantly down-regulated in response to KZR-8834 treatment at concentrations leading to cell death. IPA pathway analysis suggested that activation of the ER stress response gene ATF4 was induced by KZR-8834 treatment in H929 cells. In a resistant MM cell line, U266, only 13% of the total Sec61 clientome and 5% of total protein detected were significantly down-regulated in response to the same compound treatment. A distinct profile of down-regulated Sec61 clientome was noted with overlap in only 11 of 394 commonly expressed proteins across those two cell lines. Interestingly, in compound treated cells, 39 down-regulated Sec61 client proteins in H929 were either unchanged or upregulated in U266 cells. Conversely, 38 upregulated H929 Sec61 clients were either unchanged or down-regulated in U266 cells. We further explored the ER stress response induced by KZR-8834 via comparative proteomic analysis in H929 cells treated with known ER stress inducers, Tunicamycin and Thapsigargin. These agents, which exert ER stress upon inhibition of N- linked glycosylation and blockade of ER Ca 2+ flux, respectively, showed distinct cytosolic proteomic profiles in H929 cells relative to KZR-8834 treatment. These data suggest that KZR-8834-induced blockade of Sec61 results in a unique form of proteotoxic stress in sensitive MM cells. Collectively our results highlight quantitative proteomic profiling as a valuable tool toward elucidating the mechanism of pleiotropic acting molecules like KZR-8834. These studies constitute important first steps toward clarifying the anti-tumor mechanism inhibiting Sec61, a novel pathway agent, for the potential treatment of hematologic tumors.
