Studies in the United States (US) have identified variation in incidence and survival of multiple myeloma (MM) patients of different races, and noted that MM is the most common hematologic cancer among African Americans. This analysis was conducted to evaluate whether the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients in the US as they initiate treatment with active, symptomatic MM varies by race. Methods. Data were collected in Connect MM\u00ae, a prospective observational registry begun in September 2009 involving centers in the US. Data on patient demographics and clinical characteristics were provided by clinicians. HRQOL was reported by patients in the clinic at enrollment, within two months of diagnosis. Patients completed 3 psychometrically validated instruments: the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), EQ-5D, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Multiple Myeloma (FACT-MM). Standard analyses were conducted of each instrument. Reported mean BPI, EQ-5D and FACT-MM scores were analyzed by patient race. Statistical significance of score differences was ascertained by ANOVA using SAS 9.1 in two ways: (1) among three different racial categories (White, Black and Other), and (2) between Blacks and non-Blacks. Hispanic/Latino patients and Asian patients comprise most of the Other cohort. Results. HRQOL data at baseline were reported by 916 pts, enrolled from 189 centers. Of these patients, 82% were White, 12% were Black, and 5% were of another race (Other). Among evaluable patients, the different race groups did not differ statistically by ECOG status or multiple myeloma stage (measured by either the International Staging System or the Durie and Salmon system). The three racial groups differed by age, with the mean (SD) age of Blacks (63 (11)) and Others (63 (13)) being less than that of Whites (68 (11), p<0.0001). Gender was trending, but not statistically significantly different, between races, with males comprising 58% of Whites, 52% of Blacks, and 46% of Others (p=0.1803).

View Large Overall FACT-MM results indicate that baseline HRQOL does not vary between races, as the main summary scores do not differ statistically, although the FACT-MM Total scores of Blacks and Whites are trending higher than those of Others. Only the emotional and social/family domain scores of the FACT-MM vary statistically, as Blacks show a worse mean score in the social/family domain and a better score in the emotional domain. BPI data (on a scale of 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst pain] do not show a statistically significant difference between races, and the same is true of the five EQ-5D domains (measured on a scale of 1 [no problem] to 2 [some problems] to 3 [incapacity]. Conclusions. Initial results from the Connect MM\u00ae Registry indicate that HRQOL at baseline prior to initiation of treatment does not vary by patient race. As such, these results may serve as a baseline reference for future analyses. In particular, as patients proceed through therapy, analyses should be conducted of patients by race, among other factors, to determine whether it may be associated with subsequent clinical outcomes and HRQOL over time.
