    "abstract_text": "Background : Compared to Whites, Black-Americans may have a 40% higher incidence of idiopathic VTE. However, whether other VTE characteristics vary by race is uncertain. Objective : To compare demographic and baseline characteristics among White- and Black-Americans with VTE. Methods : Using a standardized data-collection form, demographic and baseline characteristics were prospectively collected from consecutive consenting patients enrolled in seven Thrombosis and Hemostasis Centers from August 2003 to March 2008. For patients with objectively diagnosed VTE, demographic and baseline characteristics were compared among White- and Black-American VTE patients, both overall, and by age and gender. Results : Among 1960 White- and 368 Black-Americans with VTE, compared to Whites, Blacks had significantly less isolated DVT (73.9% vs. 86.5%, p<0.001) and significantly more PE \u00b1 DVT (45.1 vs. 39.6%, p=0.05). Blacks and Whites did not differ in mean age (43.4 vs. 44.3 years), but a significantly higher proportion of Black men VTE patients were in age groups 20\u201339 and 80+ years. Blacks and Whites differed significantly by gender, with a significantly higher proportion of Black women with VTE (69.8% vs. 59.1%, p=0.0001). Blacks had a significantly higher mean BMI (32.3 vs. 29.4 kg/m 2 , p<0.0001), a significantly lower proportion with recent surgery or trauma, active cancer and infection, and a significantly lower proportion with a family history of VTE or documented thrombophilia (solely due to reduced Factor V Leiden and Prothrombin G20210A prevalence). Conversely, Blacks had a significantly higher proportion with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease and dialysis, HIV and sickle cell disease. The two races did not differ significantly regarding the proportion with idiopathic VTE, CHF, CAD/MI, peripheral artery disease, stroke or other chronic neurological disease (i.e., cerebral palsy), chronic liver disease or autoimmune disease, including antiphospholipid syndrome. Compared to White women VTE patients, Black women VTE patients had a significantly lower proportion with recent surgery, trauma, infection, oral contraceptive use and possibly hormone therapy; and a significantly higher proportion with idiopathic VTE, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, HIV and sickle cell disease. Compared to White men VTE patients, Black men VTE patients did not differ significantly regarding recent surgery, trauma, cancer, infection or autoimmune disease, but Black men had a significantly higher proportion with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, HIV and sickle cell disease. Black and White men with VTE did not differ significantly regarding idiopathic VTE, CHF, CAD/MI, stroke, peripheral arterial disease and chronic renal disease. Conclusion : White- and Black-Americans with VTE differ significantly regarding demographic and baseline characteristics that may be risk factors for VTE."
