    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an incurable bone marrow cancer characterized by the proliferation of malignant plasma cells. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key player molecule related to growth, survival and proliferation of MM cells. Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the soluble and membrane IL-6 receptor. We have previously radiolabeled Tocilizumab and its Fab\u00b4s fragments with 99m Technetium, revealing its potential role as MM radiotracers for targeting IL-6 expression in vivo [1, 2]. Near-infrared (650-900 nm) fluorescence (NIRF) cyanine (Cy) dye has been used for labeling several molecules for optical imaging due to their properties, such as small size, good aqueous solubility, and pH insensitivity between pH 3 and 10. Objectives: Label Tocilizumab and Fab\u00b4s (Tocilizumab) with Cy7 and evaluate its potential role as MM imaging agent. Methodology: IL-6R expression in MM cell lines (U266, NCI-H929 and MM1S) was confirmed by laser confocal microscopy. Tocilizumab fragmentation was carried out with papain and, once purified, fragments were identified by MALDI/TOF and SDS-PAGE. Cy7-Tocilizumab / Fab(Tocilizumab) were synthesized through nucleophilic substitution reaction between monofunctional N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Cy7-NHS) and Tocilizumab / Fab(Tocilizumab) [3]. After purification, the conjugates were characterized by spectrophotometry. For in vivo imaging, Cy7-Tocilizumab/Fab(Tocilizumab) (1 nmol) were injected intravenously in MM1S tumor-bearing Balb/c nude mice and were imaged with near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) after 0, 1, 2, 6 and 24 h post-injection of Cy7-Tocilizumab and after 0.5, 2, 6, 24, 48 and 72 h post-injection of Cy7-Fab(Tocilizumab). Results: Laser confocal microscopy showed that MM cell lines express high levels of IL-6R. Pure and homogeneous Fab-Tocilizumab fragments were produced. Tocilizumab and Fab (Tocilizumab) were successfully labeled with Cy7 as shown by spectrophotometry. Non-invasive NIRF in vivo imaging of MM tumor-bearing Balb/c nude mice allowed us to distinguish tumors up to 24 h and 72 h post-injection of Cy7-Tocilizumab and Cy7-Fab(Tocilizumab), respectively (Figures A and B). Conclusions: MM cell lines express IL-6R . Cy7 labeled Tocilizumab/Fab(Tocilizumab) has the potential to become optical imaging agents for IL-6R expressing tumors such as MM, being useful to guiding surgical excision of tumors and biopsies, that merits further evaluation.
