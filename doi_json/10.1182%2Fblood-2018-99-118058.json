    "abstract_text": "Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) remains an important consolidation treatment for multiple myeloma (MM) patients, even in the era of novel agents. The prolongation of plateau-phase induced by ASCT is generally attributed to intensive cytoreduction. However, ASCT generates inflammation and profound lymphodepletion, which may result in hitherto unexpected immunological effects. To investigate potential immunological contributions to myeloma control after ASCT, we developed preclinical models of transplantation for MM using Vk*MYC myeloma that generates bony lytic lesions, a serum M band and marrow plasmacytosis that are hallmarks of clinical disease. Myeloma-bearing B6 recipients underwent myeloablative conditioning and were transplanted with na\u00efve B6 bone marrow (BM) grafts with or without T cells from donors that were myeloma-na\u00efve (SCT) or had low M bands at the time of harvest to mimic ASCT. Surprisingly, we demonstrate the broad induction of T cell-dependent myeloma control with enhanced median survival in recipients of grafts containing T cells compared to T cell depleted (TCD) BM alone (SCT= 91 days and ASCT > 100 days post-transplant vs TCD BM alone= 44 days; p<0.0001). Myeloma was most efficiently controlled when recipients were transplanted with memory T cells (CD44 + ) from autologous grafts (median survival: ASCT-CD44 + T cells >90 days post-transplant vs. CD44 \u2500 T cells = 50 days; p = 0.0006). Importantly, T cells adoptively transferred from recipients surviving > 120 days (MM-primed) protected secondary recipients compared to T cells from na\u00efve donors (median survival: MM-primed > 120 days post-transplant vs 65 days na\u00efve T cells; p = 0.0003). Furthermore, MM-primed CD8 T cells were restricted in TCR repertoire and provided protection in a myeloma clone-specific fashion, indicative of a tumor-specific T cell response. Despite this immune-mediated control of myeloma after SCT, progression still occurred in the majority of recipients. We phenotyped CD8 + T cells from the BM of MM-relapsed, MM-controlled and MM-free (that had never seen myeloma) mice 8 weeks after SCT. Expression of the inhibitory receptors, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) on BM CD8 + T-cells strongly correlated with myeloma cell number (r = 0.729, p 120 days post-SCT vs. 60 and 68 days respectively; p <0.05). Furthermore, TIGIT blockade limited CD8 + T cell exhaustion, increased CD107a and IFN\u03b3 secretion and expanded a memory CD8 + T cell population in the BM. Genetic deletion of either IFN\u03b3 or the IFN\u03b3 receptor from the donor graft resulted in dramatic myeloma progression after SCT. Consequently, treatment with a CD137 (4-IBB) agonist early after SCT profoundly augmented CD8 + IFN\u03b3 + GranzymeB + T-cell expansion in the BM, such that majority of treated animals eliminated myeloma and survived long-term. These data provide insights into an unappreciated mechanism of action of ASCT whereby myeloma immune-equilibrium is established and suggest that combination with immunotherapeutic strategies is a rational approach to generate long term disease control.
