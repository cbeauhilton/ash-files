    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4674 Congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purura (TTP) is caused by gene mutations of von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type I domains 13, ADAMTS13). In this study, one novel mutation in the ADAMTS13 gene was found in a woman whose presents are first cousins. Thrombocytopenia occurred during the second trimesters in her first pregnancy, and she died of recurrent attacks after diagnosis of TTP. The ADAMTS13 activity measured using the recombinant FRET-VWF73 during her acute episode was less than 5%. ADAMTS13 inhibitor was negative measured by 9:1 mixture of patient and pooled normal plasma followed by ADAMTS13 activity assay using the VWF multimer electrophoresis. The 29 exons and exon-intron boundary sites of ADAMTS13 gene was analyzed using the human genomic DNA extracted from peripheral leukocytes of the patient. The results demonstrated she was homozygous for R498C. This novel mutant was constructed using the expression plasmid pSectag containing ADAMTS13 cDNA, and the vector was introduced by linpofectamine 2000 to Hela cells. Western Blot revealed that rADAMTS13-wide type (WT) was synthesized as a single band with molecular mass close to 190 Kda in the conditioned media, however, no detectable ADAMTS13 of this mutant existed. The lysates of cells expressing the mutant showed the same protein amounts compared to the rADAMTS13-WT. The immunofluorescence study demonstrated that mutant had the same localization pattern at Endoplasmic Reticulum(ER)and Golgi-compartments compared to the rADAMTS13-WT. The results imply that this mutant may be retained in the cellular ER and Golgi-comparments, but rapidly degraded or insufficiently secreted.
