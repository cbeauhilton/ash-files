    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4502 Introduction: As the prognosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with t(4;11) is generally poor, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HSCT) at 1 st complete remission is recommended in most of Japanese ALL protocol. We analyzed outcomes of HSCT for childhood ALL with t(4;11) at our department, and assessed the outcomes with age and preconditioning at HSCT. Subjects: We retrospectively analyzed 15 patients who underwent HSCT between 1991 and 2011. The onset of ALL was less than one year old (infant ALL) in 9 patients and over one year old in 6 patients. The disease status at HSCT was 1 st complete remission (CR1) in 10 patients, 2 nd complete remission (CR2) in 2 patients, and more advanced stages in 3 patients. 13 patients underwent allogeneic HSCT and 2 patients underwent autologous HSCT at median age of 19 months. In allogeneic HSCT, the number of bone marrow transplantation from HLA matched sibling was 3 and 4 from unrelated donors, and that of cord blood transplantation was 6. Nine patients including 7 infant ALL underwent conventional stem cell transplantation (CST), 6 patients including one infant ALL underwent reduced intensity stem cell transplantation (RIST). Preconditioning of RIST was mostly consisted of fludarabine and melphalan with 3Gy of total body irradiation (TBI). Results: Of all 15 patients, 8 patients are alive in CR. Three out of 9 infant ALL and 5 out of 6 ALL patients, whose onset was above 1 year old, are alive in CR. Seven of 10 ALL patients who underwent HSCT in 1 st CR are alive, on the other hand, only one of 5 patients in 2 nd CR or non CR is alive. Five patients who underwent RIST over 1 year old are alive in CR. Discussion: HSCT for childhood ALL with t(4;11) in 1 st CR could achieve better outcome than those in 2 nd CR or non CR. The transplant outcomes with RIST was better than CST and it could be applied for ALL patients with t(4;11) whose onset is over one year old.
