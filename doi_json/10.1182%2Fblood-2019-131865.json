    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is incurable and 80% of MM patients develop MM bone disease (MMBD). MMBD lesions do not heal due to the persistent suppression of bone formation, which markedly increases mortality and contributes to MM drug resistance. Current treatments for MMBD, such as bisphosphonates and denosumab, target bone destruction but do not result in new bone formation. Although proteasome inhibitors (PIs) have greatly improved survival of MM patients, they only have transient bone anabolic effects. Further, development of drug resistance to PIs remains a major clinical problem. We previously showed that the ZZ domain of p62 (sequestosome-1),plays an important role in both MM growth and suppression of osteoblast (OB) differentiation in the MM microenvironment, by regulating multiple signaling pathways and acting as a cargo-receptor for autophagy. Recently, our collaborators showed that the p62-ZZ is a high-affinity N-recognin of the N-end rule pathway (NERP). p62-ZZ also serves as the molecular switch for necroptotic versus apoptotic cell death pathways. We previously reported that MM cells or TNF\u03b1 prevent OB differentiation by inducing persistent epigenetic repression of the Runx2-P1 promoter in MM patient bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), via the transcriptional repressor Gfi1. We found that blocking p62-ZZ by saturating it with a novel synthetic p62-ZZ/NERP competing ligand, XRK3F2, prevented and reversed MM-induced Gfi1 occupancy at the Runx2-P1 promoter, allowing BMSCs to increase OB marker gene expression and to mineralize. These results suggest that targeting the p62-ZZ/N-end rule pathway would enhance the bone anabolic effects of PIs. To test this hypothesis, we first exposed normal OBs to different doses of bortezomib (Btz) or XRK3F2 or their combination. The combination significantly increased OB differentiation markers Runx2 (60%), Osterix (20%) and ATF4 (60%), and induced mineral deposition compared with either drug alone. The combination also blocked TNF\u03b1 up-regulation of Gfi1 and suppression of OB differentiation. Interestingly, none of the concentrations tested decreased OB viability. Studies with MM patient-BMSCs showed that XRK3F2 reversed suppression of OB differentiation induced by MM cells, allowing them to mineralize. Importantly, our preliminary in vivo data showed that administration of XRK3F2 to mice with established MM induced dramatic cortical bone formation in MM-containing bones but had no effect on tumor burden. We and others previously showed that MM cells subjected to sustained proteasomal inhibition, rely on p62-mediated autophagic degradation to reduce the proteotoxic load caused by excessive immunoglobulin synthesis. We recently found that targeting the p62-ZZ domain in human MM cells, increases Btz-induced MM cell death, independently of their p53 status. The combination also significantly reduced cell viability in Btz resistant cells although no caspase 3 activation was observed, suggesting a caspase-3 independent cell death. To determine the mechanism(s) responsible for MM cell death induced by the combination, we pretreated MM cell lines and primary CD138+ MM cells with Z-DEVD (20\u03bcM), bafilomycin (Baf, 40nM), or necrostatin1 (NEC1, 50\u03bcM). The anti-MM effects of XRK3F2 or Btz+XRK3F2 were fully blocked by NEC1, an inhibitor of necroptosis, but not by inhibitors of caspase-dependent apoptosis (Z-DEVD) or autophagy (Baf), supporting that p62-ZZ regulates necroptosis in MM cells. RNAseq analysis of the additive effect of Btz+XRK3F2 on gene expression showed a total of 583 differentially regulated genes, including 374 significantly down-regulated and 209 significantly upregulated. GO term analysis of up-regulated DEGs identified an enrichment in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ER unfolded protein response, and regulation of transcription in response to stress and autophagy. In summary, our results demonstrate that targeting the p62-ZZ/N-end rule pathway in combination with PIs in MM significantly reduces MM cell viability by activating multiple death pathway and overcomes PI-resistance of MM cells. In addition, targeting the p62-ZZ in OBs potentiates the bone anabolic action of PIs and reverses the persistent OB suppression induced by MM cells to allow bone formation. Thus, p62-ZZ plays a critical role in MM and bone cells and identifies p62-ZZ as an important molecular target for the treatment of MMBD.
