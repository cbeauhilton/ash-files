    "abstract_text": "Introduction: There are little information about the epidemiology of chronic leukemias in our country. Epidemiology from two large medical centers was recently published (Gac Med Mex 2016;152:208-212). Other publications only refers to one type of leukemia or is from more than 18 years (Salud Publica Mex 2016;58:291-285 and Int J Hematol 1999;69:253-255). Objective: Report the epidemiology data of chronic myeloid and lymphoid leukemias (CML, B-CLL) in our region. Material and methods: Epidemiology data of samples referred to Laboratorios Fatima de Michoacan for karyotyping or PCR for CML, and flow cytometry for CLL. Results: Eighty one positive samples for CML, 49 karyotypes and 32 PCR (hematologist indication); 41 males and 40 females with 1.02 ratio; age range from 15 to 87 years with an average of 45.6; age groups: three under 19, thirteen from 20 to 29, twenty from 30 to 39, thirteen from 40 to 49, thirteen from 50 to 59, eight from 60 to 69, ten from 70 to 79 and one more than 80. Ninety two positive to B-CLL; 49 males and 43 females with 1.14 ratio; age range from 27 to 89 years with an average of 67.4; age group, one from 20 to 29, one from 30 to 39, three from 40 to 49, nineteen from 50 to 59, thirty four from 60 to 69, twenty one from 70 to 79 and thirteen more than 80. Conclusions: These type of leukemias are seen mainly in adults, the age of presentation is more than 22 years earlier for CML compared to CLL. In our results CLL is more frequent than CML, 1.14 ratio; this can be explained because of the European heritage in our region (The New Spain Colony and the French intervention in Mexico), as is seen in the epidemiology of hemophilia and hereditary thrombophilias; other factor is the support of the pharmaceutical industry to the social security for the diagnosis of CML. It is important to compare with other regions in our country and to form a database. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
