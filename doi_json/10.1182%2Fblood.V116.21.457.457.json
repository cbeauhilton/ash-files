    "abstract_text": "Abstract 457 Introduction- The 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria for myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) underscore the role of bone marrow (BM) morphology in distinguishing essential thrombocythemia (ET) from early, and at times prefibrotic, primary myelofibrosis (PMF) that clinically presents like ET. The value of such a distinction in predicting clinical outcome has been questioned by some investigators. Study Design- Clinician scientists and hematopathologists from seven international centers of excellence for ET convened to design a clinicopathologic database of patients locally diagnosed and treated as ET. Study eligibility criteria included availability of treatment-nai\u0308ve BM specimens obtained within one year of diagnosis. All bone marrows subsequently underwent a central blinded re-review by the author of the pertinent WHO chapter (JT) who applied strict WHO guidelines to identify cases of early PMF that were spuriously diagnosed as ET. Results- Revision of the BM biopsies according to the WHO morphological criteria confirmed ET in 891 patients (81%). Diagnosis was revised to early, prefibrotic PMF in 180 patients (16%). The remaining 33 (3%) BM specimens were qualitatively inadequate for accurate classification or represented unclassified cases. i) At presentation, early PMF, as opposed to true ET, was characterized by higher leukocyte (p<0.0001) and platelet (p=0.002) counts, lower hemoglobin (p=0.01) and hematocrit (p=0.001) levels, higher serum lactate dehydrogenase level (p<0.0001), higher circulating CD34+ cell count (p=0.03) and higher rate of palpable splenomegaly. JAK2 V617F mutational frequency was 60% in each of the two groups. ii) Median follow-up was 6.2 years for ET and 7.0 years for early PMF. During this period, the rates of arterial (1.2-1.4% patients/year) and venous (0.6 patients/year) thrombotic complications were similar in the two groups. However, patients with early PMF, as compared to those with ET, were more likely to develop overt myelofibrosis (1% vs. 0.5% patients/year; RR=2.0, p=0.04) or acute leukemia (0.6% vs. 0.1% patients/year; RR=5.2, p=0.001). Cumulative leukemic transformation rate at 10 and 15 years was 0.7% and 2.1% in true ET versus 5.8% and 11.7% in PMF Similarly, survival was significantly worse in patients with early PMF (mortality rate: 2.7% vs. 1.3% patients/year; RR=2.1, p=0.002).The 10 and 15-years overall survival rates were: 89% and 80% in true ET versus 76% and 59% in PMF. On multivariable analysis, other risk factors for poor survival were age > 60 years (HR=6.3, p 11\u00d710 9 /L (HR=2.13, p<0.0001) and history of thrombosis (HR=3.0, p<0.0001). Conclusions- The current study validates the clinical relevance of strict adherence to WHO criteria in the diagnosis of ET and provides seminal information on the survival and risk of leukemic transformation in strictly WHO-defined ET, which appears to be substantially better than previously assumed.
