    "abstract_text": "Abstract 231 Reduced Intensity conditioning (RIC) offers a feasible option for older patients to an allogeneic stem cell transplant and to potentially benefit from a graft vs leukaemia effect. However the relative clinical benefit in AML is less clear. Since our previous experience did not show an overall survival advantage from myeloablative transplant in patients >40 years we have examined the impact of RIC allograft in 1 st CR on the outcome of patients aged 40\u201370 years treated within the UK NCRI AML15 (2002\u20132009) and AML16 (2006\u20132012) trials compared to chemotherapy. Methods: Both trials offered the option of RIC transplant in CR1 for patients who were not good risk. A total of 2454 patients between 40 to 70 years entered CR (AML15: 1580 and AML16: 874) of whom 407 received a RIC (292/1580 in AML15 and 115/874 in AML16). Matched sibling transplants were given in 229, and MUDs in 178. The cytogenetic risk groups were 258 intermediate, 59 adverse, 90 not known. Follow-up is complete to 1 st January 2012. Comparisons of transplant versus not are carried out using Mantel-Byar analysis to allow for time to transplant, with patients censored at the time of non-RIC allo transplant. Data from the two trials were pooled and split by age. Results: The OS for the 255 patients <60 yrs. was significantly superior to no transplant (53% vs 41%, HR 0.79(0.66\u20130.96), p=0.02). There was clear benefit in the 164 intermediate risk group patients (59% vs 44%, HR 0.67 (0.53\u20130.86) p=0.0008) with less evidence for the 40 who had adverse risk (16% vs 10%, HR 0.89 (0.58\u20131.35) p=0.6). In 152 patients 60+ yrs. the overall benefit was not significantly superior (37% vs 24%, HR 0.85 (0.68\u20131.06), p=0.2), there was a non-significant trend for benefit in the 94 intermediate risk group patients (43% vs 26%, HR 0.73 (0.49\u20131.09), p=0.3), and clearer benefit in the 19 patients in the adverse group (16% vs 3%, HR 0.57 (0.36\u20130.91), p=0.01). Considering the types of transplant, in the <60 group the survival benefit was restricted to sibling RIC (Sibling 61%: MUD 35%: no transplant 41%), and in the 60+ group a similar trend of borderline significance was seen (Sibling 49%:MUD 28%: no transplant 24%). In analysis by cytogenetic group, with the exception of patients over 60 yrs with adverse karyotype, sibling allograft gave consistently better survival. Conclusion: This pooled analysis shows that RIC allo SCT in AML 1 st CR improves the survival of older patients with AML aged 60 years overall benefit was less clear but there was a similar trend for benefit in intermediate risk patients. However, given the lack of statistical heterogeneity, our data does not exclude a benefit for patients with adverse risk cytogenetics or for those undergoing SCT from an unrelated donor. This observation runs counter to what we observe in patients <40 yrs, where the benefit is limited to adverse risk patients.
