    "abstract_text": "Background: Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a human T-lymphotropic virus type-I mediated neoplasm and four major clinical subtypes are recognized; i.e., smoldering, chronic, lymphoma and acute types. Among these subtypes, acute and lymphoma types are fetal disease with poor prognosis. Although these two subtypes represent different clinical features, detailed analysis for genomic/genetic differences has not been sufficiently investigated. Purpose: To investigate genomic aberrations of these subtypes, we performed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH: 2308 BAC clones spotted in duplicate) for 66 cases of ATLL (17 cases of acute and 49 cases of lymphoma subtypes). To determine target genes in recurrently amplified regions, quantitative real-time PCR (RQ-PCR) was conducted. Results: Array CGH: Comparison of genome profiles revealed that lymphoma type shows more frequent gain and loss than those of acute type. The numbers of respective genomic gain and loss regions of lymphoma type were 9.7 and 9.8 on average. The numbers of genomic gain and loss regions of acute type were 4.2 and 4.5 on average. Gain of 1q, 2p, 4q, 7p and 7q, and loss of 10p, 13q, 16q and 18p were characteristic to lymphoma type whereas gain of 3p and 3q was specific to acute type. Recurrent high-level amplifications were found at 1p35, 6p25, 7p22.2, 7q21\u2013q22, 7q31\u2013q36 and 14q32 in lymphoma type. However, such genomic amplifications were not found in acute type. RQ-PCR: CARMA1 (7p22 locus), which encodes signaling proteins associated with development of B and T cells, was a possible target of the 7p22 amplification in lymphoma type. The extremely higher expression of BCL11B (14q32 locus) which is a key regulator of both differentiation and survival during thymocyte development, was found in acute type irrespective of the 14q32 amplification. However, no overexpression of BCL11B was found in lymphoma type with high copy number gain, indicating that BCL11B is not the target gene for 14q32 amplification in the lymphoma type. Conclusion: Array-CGH revealed that patterns of genomic aberrations between acute and lymphoma types were different. Quantitative gene expression analysis also implicated distinct mechanism of aberrant gene expressions between acute and lymphoma types. Combination of array-CGH and quantitative gene expression analysis provided evidence that the acute and lymphoma types are developed via distinct genomic/genetic pathways.",
