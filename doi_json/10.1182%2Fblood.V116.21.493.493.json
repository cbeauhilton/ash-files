    "abstract_text": "Abstract 493 The International MRC UKALL XII/ECOG E2993 trial for adults with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) recruited 1,914 patients to the main part of the trial from 1995 up to its closure in 2006, of whom 100 were over the age of 55 years (median 57, range 55\u201365). Beginning in 2003 (MRC) or 2004 (ECOG), patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+ve) disease were entered into an Imatinib sub-study. We report here baseline characteristics, treatment course and outcomes, and discuss implications for future management strategies. Direct comparison of the 100 patients over 55 yrs with 1,814 under 55 yrs showed that the groups are comparable for gender, immunophenotype and white cell count but there is an indication that more elderly patients had Ph+ve disease (28% aged \u226555 vs 17% aged <55 of those entered before the start of the Imatinib trial; p=0.02). All patients in this trial received a 2 stage induction regimen, consisting of Daunorubicin, Vincristine, Asparaginase and Steroid followed by Cyclophosphamide, Cytarabine, 6-Mercaptopurine and Methotrexate. CNS prophylaxis with IT Methotrexate and Cytarabine was given during both phases. There was a randomisation to autograft or chemotherapy, but only a small number of patients in this age group were randomised (13 autograft and 13 consolidation chemotherapy). Outcomes Complete remission (CR) rate, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were all worse in the over 55 age group, and even after achieving CR, the 5-year OS rate was reduced. There were more infections in phase I induction (67% vs 45%, p<0.0001) and more deaths during induction chemotherapy (18% vs 4% p<0.0001). Excluding those who died in induction, 47% had drug dose reductions in phase I or phase II vs 27% <55 yrs (P=0.0006). Of these, Asparaginase was the most common in those aged \u226555 years, usually due to hepatotoxicity.  . Age . p-value <55 vs \u226555 . <55 . \u226555 .

Infection during induction chemotherapy predicted for worse EFS; this was especially significant in those who had infection in both phases of induction (6% vs 38%, p=0.007). In those patients who received chemotherapy and were not transplanted, the differences in outcome were smaller: 5-yr OS 25% in \u226555 years vs 38% in 0.1). Conclusion Older adults fared significantly worse than younger adults both in terms of achieving an initial CR and long-term survival. This difference cannot be explained solely by a difference in disease characteristics, and the marked increase in infection and deaths during induction reflect the inability of many older patients to tolerate the intensive level of treatment. This is also supported by the large numbers of drug omissions or dose reductions seen. Our data show that this inability to tolerate induction chemotherapy is a major contributor to the poor outcomes seen in this age group. The less marked differences between age groups when transplant patients are excluded, indicates the significant mortality associated with these procedures in older patients. Alternative approaches to consider in this group include less intensive induction with a steroid and vinca alkaloid combination, in conjunction with targeted therapies (eg Rituximab in B-lineage CD20+ disease, Imatinib Mesylate in Ph+ disease). Even amongst those patients who do achieve CR however, the long-term outcome is worse. Reduced intensity allografts may play a role in carefully selected patients in this age group, and the emerging use of MRD monitoring may also assist in selecting patients for more or less intensive approaches.
