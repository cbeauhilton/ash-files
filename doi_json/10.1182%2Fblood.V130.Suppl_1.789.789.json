    "abstract_text": "Loss of all or part of chromosome 7 [-7/del(7q)] is a common, high-risk cytogenetic abnormality identified in a variety myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia, therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). CUX1 is a non-clustered, homeodomain-containing transcription factor encoded on the commonly deleted region of 7q22. CUX1 inactivating mutations occur across solid tumors and myeloid neoplasms, and carry a poor prognosis in myeloid malignancies independently of 7q status. Previously, we reported that CUX1 is a conserved, haploinsufficient, myeloid tumor suppressor. To determine the mechanism by which CUX1 regulates leukemogenesis, we generated an inducible, shRNA-transgenic, Cux1 -knockdown mouse model. Insufficient Cux1 levels caused early mortality in mice, due to a spontaneous myeloproliferative disorder with features of CMML/JMML and MDS. Cux1 deficient mice had a significant increase in myelomonocytic cell numbers in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen. Cux1 deficiency led to extramedullary hematopoiesis, splenomegaly, and an increase in megakaryocyte numbers and megakaryocyte dysplasia. In addition, Cux1 is required for normal red cell development, as Cux1 knockdown led to a normocytic anemia due to an erythroblast maturation arrest. To identify CUX1 transcriptional targets, we performed gene expression profiling after CUX1 knockdown in CD34+ human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Differentially expressed genes were enriched for genes deregulated in JMML and -7/del(7q) MDS, in addition to altered expression of quiescent, proliferative, and myeloid differentiation pathways. Consistent with these gene signatures, Cux1 maintains hematopoietic stem cell quiescence and represses HSPC proliferation, self-renewal, and granulocyte/monocyte differentiation. Thus Cux1 has pleotropic roles in multiple myeloid lineages. Deletion of CUX1 , in the context of -7/del(7q), may facilitate myeloid transformation through aberrant transcriptional regulation of HSPC differentiation and proliferation.
