    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3243 Objective: Previous reports indicated that short term prognosis for patients with malignant diseases and serious adverse events requiring mechanical ventilation (SAEV) is not dismal any more. The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients who survive such complications can also achieve long term cure from leukemia. It might influence end-of-live decisions on the intensive care unit if patients with an SEAV only survive intensive care to succumb to relapse. Patients and Methods: We report the outcome of children with SAEV treated in the multicenter studies ALL-BFM 95 and AML-BFM 98. Data from 1182 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 332 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were analyzed. 88 patients (51 ALL; 37 AML) developed an SAEV. Results: The prognosis was almost identical in ALL and AML (50% survival of SAEV; 30% overall survival after 5 years). This was independent from the time between diagnosis of leukemia and SAEV. Even children who required hemodialysis (n=14) or cardiac resuscitation (n=16) achieved 20% long term survival but no patient survived (n=16) who fulfilled more than 3 out of 6 identified risk factors: age\u226510 years, high risk leukemia, C-reactive Protein\u2265150mg/l, administration of inotropic infusion, cardiac resuscitation, and hemodialysis. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report about cure rates in a malignant disease after successful treatment of SAEV. Our results show that intensive care medicine contributes to short and long term survival of children with leukemia. Sixty percent of all children with acute leukemia who survive an SAEV achieve long term cure. However, we could also identify risk features that still indicate a devastating prognosis.
