    "abstract_text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a point mutation in the \u03b2-chain of hemoglobin, which triggers a complex pathophysiology resulting in recurrent, painful vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) and chronic hemolytic anemia. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is the major species of hemoglobin during fetal and neonatal development, the expression of which is replaced by the adult beta globin perinatally. Reactivation of HbF in adult SCD patients is considered beneficial in ameliorating the symptoms of the disease. This is exemplified by a condition known as hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) in heterozygous sickle disease patients where symptoms of SCD are absent and the typical HbF level is over 30% (Steinberg, M.H. et al, 2014). Strategies to reactivate HbF have been used successfully in mouse models of SCD and led to amelioration of the disease phenotype, which is also partly the mechanism of action of hydroxyurea, the only FDA approved drug for SCD. Up-regulation of HbF can be achieved by several different approaches including pharmacologic or genetic manipulation of transcription activators or repressors of HbF. Nuclear factor (erythroid derived-2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that has been shown to activate \u03b3-globin transcription and increase HbF levels in cultured CD34+ erythroid cells. Nrf2 is well established for its role in cytoprotective and anti-oxidant actions by transcriptionally activating target genes that confer protection from oxidative damage triggered from injury and inflammation. Nrf2 is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by Keap1, a Kelch-domain protein. Release of Nrf2 from Keap1 allows nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and activation of target genes via its binding to an anti-oxidant response element (ARE) in the promoter region of Nrf2 target genes. Previous studies (Macari and Lowrey, 2011) have demonstrated that the \u03b3-globin promoter contains an ARE sequence supporting Nrf2 as an inducer of HbF. We investigated the role of dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a small molecule Nrf2 agonist, in activating \u03b3-globin transcription and enhancing levels of HbF in tissue culture and murine SCD models. Delayed-release DMF, approved by the FDA as Tecfidera, is an oral therapeutic for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). After oral administration of DMF, human exposure occurs to both DMF and the bioactive primary metabolite, monomethyl fumarate (MMF). We assessed the ability of increasing concentrations of DMF to induce \u03b3-globin mRNA in human erythroleukemia cells, CD34+ cells isolated from bone marrow of non-SCD volunteer donors, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from SCD volunteer donors. \u03b3-globin mRNA increased by 3-4 fold compared to control as quantitated using real-time PCR. DMF incubation also resulted in 2-fold upregulation in HbF protein levels as demonstrated by UPLC and western blotting analysis and also a 2-fold induction in percentage of RBC containing HbF (F-cells) by flow cytometry. In addition, co-incubation of DMF with hydroxyurea produced an additive effect on \u03b3-globin mRNA (8 - 10 fold in non-SCD; 2-4 fold in SCD) and F-cell induction in CD34+ stem cell derived erythroid progenitors (3-4 fold in both SCD and non-SCD). DMF treatment of KU812 erythroleukemia cells induced Nrf2 activation resulting in Nrf2 nuclear translocation and occupancy of the ARE in the \u03b3-globin promoter by ChIP assay. Moreover, siRNA based knockdown of Keap1 resulted in up-regulation of HbF by flow cytometry, demonstrating that activation of the Nrf2 pathway in erythroid cells can result in the up-regulation of HbF. The effect of DMF on HbF induction was assessed in the Townes SCD mouse model. Townes mice were administered DMF at 100 mg/kg IP for 5 day per week for one month duration and compared to treatment with vehicle control and to treatment with hydroxyurea. This dose and route of administration of DMF resulted in clinically relevant plasma levels of MMF in Townes mice. After a month of dosing, there was a 3- to 4-fold increase in circulating F-cells in the DMF treated mice which was comparable to the hydroxyurea treated mice. Based on these findings, DMF may have potential as an HbF inducer in the therapy of SCD, in addition to its vascular protective and heme detoxifying properties (Belcher et al, ASH 2014). Further clinical studies are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DMF in SCD. Disclosures Krishnamoorthy: Biogen: Employment, Equity Ownership. Gupta: Biogen: Employment, Equity Ownership.
