    "abstract_text": "Background: Venetoclax (ven) was approved for older untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients due to high response rates and durable remissions. As a participating site in the dose escalation study, we observed deeper/more durable responses in some who received >400mg ven. We also noted 16/33 discontinued azacitidine (aza) after achieving a response; 9 relapsed and 7 remained in long term remission on ven only. Based on these observations, we designed a study that hypothesized: A)Higher initial doses of ven would allow deeper/more durable responses, and B)Multi modality high sensitivity measurable residual disease (MRD) testing could identify patients able to discontinue aza and remain on maintenance ven. Methods: This is an ongoing phase 2 study (NCT03466294) of 42 untreated AML patients \u226560 who decline/are ineligible for induction. Patients have adequate organ function and white blood cell counts <25x10 9 /L (hydrea permitted). In cycle 1, patients receive aza 75mg/m 2 on days (d) 1-7 and ven, escalated from 100 to 200 to 400 to 600mg on d 1-4. Ven continues at 600mg d 5-28 and bone marrow biopsies (BMBXs) are performed on d 8 and 28. Patients who achieve morphologic remission without count recovery have up to 14 days off therapy before subsequent cycles, with growth factor support; \"upgraded\" responses are recorded if count recovery occurs. Non responders discontinue or receive up to two additional cycles of aza and ven 600mg. Responders who remain MRD+ by multiparameter flow cytometry (MPFC, Hematologics) and/or digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) for as many identifiable diagnostic genes as possible also receive up to 2 additional cycles of aza and ven 600mg. MRD+ responders after 3 cycles continue aza and ven 400mg until toxicity/progression. Patients who experience MRD- responses at any time stop aza and continue ven 400mg daily (Fig 1). Results: 30 patients enrolled between May 2018 and July 2019; median age is 71 (60-88), 10% evolved from MDS and 10% and 73% had intermediate and unfavorable risk disease by ELN, respectively (Table 1). 732 adverse events (AEs) occurred; 46 (6%) were serious, the most common were neutropenic fever (37%) and pneumonia (13%). The most common >grade 2 related AEs were leukopenia (53%), thrombocytopenia (44%) and neutropenia (35%); there were no related grade 5 AEs. The overall response rate was 70% (21/30; CR=19, MLFS=2). Median number of cycles to achieve best response was 1. Significant blast reductions were seen on day 8; of the 28 with interpretable day 8 BMBXs, 10 achieved MLFS on day 8. 4 completed \u22651 cycle and were refractory. An additional 4 did not complete cycle 1: 1 died of disease and 3 elected to come off therapy (all subsequently died of disease). Four (19%) responders relapsed, after a median 180 days (27-279). With median follow up of 214 days, median response duration has not been reached. 10 patients died, after a median 65 days (29-256); 1/30 died within 30 days. Median overall survival has not been reached. Of the 26 who completed \u22651 cycle, 19 were MRD- by MPFC, including 18/19 who achieved CR. Of these 26, 3 were not monitored by ddPCR: for 2 patients this was due to the absence of detectable baseline mutations and for 1 patient it was due to refractory disease. The remaining 23 had ddPCR monitoring; 3 became MRD- by this modality (Fig 2). All 3 were also MRD- by MPFC and per protocol discontinued aza and initiated ven maintenance (Fig 1). MRD negativity by both parameters occurred after cycles 1, 2 and 3, respectively. One MRD- patient relapsed after 216 days; two remain in remission after 301 and 124 days. An additional 4 who achieved MRD+ responses discontinued aza at their insistence (and in violation of the protocol); 1 relapsed after 279 days, and 3 remain in ongoing remission. Univariate predictors of refractory disease were FAB M0/M1 (OR 0.070, p=0.02) and RAS pathway mutations (OR 14.25, p=0.02). Conclusions: Higher initial doses of ven are tolerated in this population. Blast reduction occurs quickly in many patients (day 8), for this low intensity regimen. Response rates are consistent with lower doses of ven. Very deep responses, as measured by highly sensitive MRD methods (MPFC and ddPCR are capable of sensitivity up to 0.02%), are attainable. Longer follow up time will determine if higher ven doses and MRD-driven decisions related to continuation of aza result in more durable responses. Increased maturation of blasts and RAS pathway mutations are predictors for refractory disease.
