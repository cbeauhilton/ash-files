    "abstract_text": "Purpose To observe the immunological responses of recipients to infused lymphocytes from donors of different genetic backgrounds. Methods Mouse models were set up by mating female BALB/c mice with male C57BL mice. Splenic lymphocytes from donors of different genetic backgrounds were labeled with CFSE, and 1\u221910 7 of the cells were intravenously injected into a recipient. At 6, 24, 72 and 120 h after the infusion, mononuclear cells in recipient spleen, liver, thymus, lymph node and peripheral blood were collected, and CFSE+, CFSE-, CD3+, CD8+, CD4+, CD19+, NK1.1+, CD25+, CD127+ lymphocytes in these samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. The distribution of donor T cells, B cells, NK cells, helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and recipient regulatory T cells in these tissues were then obtained. Results Maternal lymphocytes were more likely to survive in offspring. At 120 h after the infusion, the ratio of maternal cells was 0.52\u00a1\u00c00.11% in lymph node, 0.97\u00a1\u00c00.04% in peripheral blood, and 0.97\u00a1\u00c00.11% in spleen of the offspring. In aunt to child, father to child, and unrelated allogeneic groups at 120 h after the infusion, few donor cells, if any, were detected in these tissues. The subtype proportion of donor lymphocytes changed significantly in recipient tissues. Recipient Treg cells increased in mother to child group but not in aunt to child, father to child, and unrelated allogeneic groups, suggesting the decrease of cellular immune responses to allogeneic cells in mother to child group. At 120 h after the infusion, no donor cells were detected in recipient liver and thymus in all groups, implying that donor cells colonized hardly in liver and thymus. Conclusion Specific immune tolerance to maternal lymphocytes existed in offspring. Donor lymphocyte infusion of maternal origin may obtain a relatively persistent effect of adoptive immunotherapy with less side-effect. Figure 1.
