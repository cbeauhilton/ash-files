    "abstract_text": "Background: Cobomarsen (MRG-106) is an inhibitor of miR-155, a microRNA with a strong link to cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) pathogenesis. The goals of this first in human study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of cobomarsen in mycosis fungoides (MF) patients. Methods: This Phase 1 trial evaluated cobomarsen given via intralesional injection (75 mg/dose), subcutaneous (SC), IV rapid bolus injection, or 2-hour IV infusion (300, 600 or 900 mg/dose). Patients must have MF stage I-III with plaques and/or tumors and could remain on concurrent stable CTCL therapy. Patients received 6 doses, either subcutaneous or intravenous, in the first 26 days of the study followed by weekly or bi-monthly doses. Safety was monitored by physical exams, clinical lab tests, and reported adverse events (AEs). Efficacy was assessed by CAILS and by the modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT). The effect of cobomarsen on quality of life was assessed by Skindex-29. Results: 38 subjects receiving IV or SC treatment (25 male/13 female, median age 59 years) have been on study for up to 22 months. As of the data cut off, no serious AEs have been attributed to cobomarsen. The most common AEs reported in greater than 15% of subjects were: fatigue, neutropenia, injection site pain, nausea, pruritus, and headache. Two AEs were deemed dose limiting toxicities (DLTs): Grade 3 worsening pruritus and Grade 3 tumor flare. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has not yet been reached. In the subcutaneous and IV cohorts, 29 out of 32 (91%) evaluable subjects had improvement in mSWAT score. Skin improvements were observed as early as the first assessment (Day 17). The best improvements were observed after more than 1 month of treatment. Eleven out of twenty-one (52%) patients receiving more than one month of dosing (6 doses) achieved greater than 50% reduction in mSWAT score. The mean duration of response (n=11) was 213 days, as of data cut off. Eight patients achieved a partial response meeting the criteria for ORR4, an objective response rate lasting at least four months in duration. The overall skin response in patients who received cobomarsen as monotherapy or cobomarsen with concurrent stable therapy were not significantly different. Improvement in quality of life (QOL), as measured by the Skindex-29 total score, correlated with reductions in mSWAT score during the treatment phase. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that cobomarsen is well-tolerated, has clinical activity, and has the potential to impact MF quality of life. These encouraging data support the continued investigation of cobomarsen in the CTCL population. The study is expanded to enroll patients with other hematologic malignancies in which miR-155 is elevated and relevant, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and adult T cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL). Final safety and efficacy data on CTCL mycosis fungoides will be presented.
