    "abstract_text": "A novel therapeutic approach in cancer attempting to stimulate host anti-tumor immunity involves blocking of immune checkpoints. Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3) is an immune checkpoint receptor expressed on activated/exhausted T-cells. When engaged by MHC Class II (MHCII) molecules, LAG3 negatively regulates T-cell function thereby contributing to tumor escape. Intriguingly, a soluble LAG3 variant was reported to activate both immune and malignant MHCII-presenting cells. In this study, we examined the role of LAG3 in the pathogenesis of CLL and show that CLL cells express and secrete LAG3. High levels of surface and soluble LAG3 were associated with the unmutated immunoglobulin variable heavy chain CLL and a more aggressive disease. It was evident that recombinant soluble LAG3-Ig fusion protein activated CLL cells, induced increased levels of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and protected the cells from spontaneous apoptosis, utilizing a mechanism mediated through MHCII engagement. Our data suggest that autocrine secretion of soluble LAG3 from CLL cells and its subsequent interaction with MHCII on their surface, promotes CLL cell activation and anti-apoptotic effects. Moreover, CLL cells may impose immune exhaustion on their microenvironment by expressing MHCII, thus affecting the surrounding, LAG3-presenting immune cells. Hence, blocking LAG3-MHCII interactions is a potential therapeutic target in CLL. Disclosures Avivi: Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical center: Consultancy, Other: consultancy to :BMS Roche.
