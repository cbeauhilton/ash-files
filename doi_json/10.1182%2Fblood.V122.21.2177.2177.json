    "abstract_text": "RUNX1 and NF-E2 are transcription factors that regulate hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis. It has been reported that increased RUNX1 expression in the granulocytes is present in all three classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN): polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis (Wang et al, Blood 2010), and that elevated NF-E2 promotes erythropoietin (EPO)-independent erythroid maturation of hematopoietic stem cells in vitro (Bogeska et al, Stem Cells Transl Med 2013). A mouse model overexpressing the NF-E2 transgene in hematopoietic cells was reported to be a new model of myeloproliferative neoplasms (Kaufmann et al, J Exp Med 2012). Polycythemic states can be divided into primary polycythemias, characterized by intrinsically hyperproliferative erythroid progenitors that are hypersensitive to EPO, and secondary polycythemias, wherein erythroid progenitors respond normally to EPO but circulating EPO is elevated or inappropriately normal for the level of increased red cell mass. Some congenital disorders including those with mutations in the hypoxia sensing pathway may share features of both primary and secondary polycythemias. We considered the possibility that increased transcripts of RUNX1 and NF-E2 might be the feature of other primary polycythemic states as well. We report a study of 19 polycythemic patients with primary or secondary polycythemia with diverse etiologies including mutations in positive and negative regulators of hypoxia sensing pathway. RUNX1 and NF-E2 transcripts were quantitated in granulocytes and BFU-E colonies by qPCR. All primary polycythemic patients had erythroid progenitors hypersensitive to or independent to EPO; all secondary polycythemic subjects had normal erythroid progenitor response to EPO. RUNX1 and NF-E2 gene transcripts were increased in granulocytes and BFU-E colonies in all PV patients, two unrelated subjects with the VHL R200W homozygous mutation (Chuvash polycythemia), one polycythemic patient homozygous for the VHL P138L exon 2 mutation, and a patient with the HIF2\u03b1 M535V gain-of-function mutation. We also found upregulated expression of RUNX1 and NF-E2 in granulocytes and BFU-Es from a polycythemic patient (with no detectable EPOR , JAK2 V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutations and low level of EPO < 1 mU/mL) who was heterozygous for a SNP in exon 3 (rs147341899) in the LNK gene. We examined transcripts of RUNX1 and NF-E2 genes in granulocytes from two Croatian polycythemic patients with a homozygous VHL H191D exon 3 mutation whose erythroid progenitors were not hypersensitive to EPO and whose RUNX1 , but not NF-E2 , transcript was increased. We found similar results in two compound heterozygotes for VHL T124A exon 2 and VHL L188V exon 3 mutations. These two polycythemic siblings had hypersensitive erythroid colonies, increased RUNX1 transcripts and decreased NF-E2 transcripts in granulocytes. RUNX1 and NF-E2 transcripts were normal in two subjects with primary polycythemia due to the EPOR gain-of-function EPOR Q434X mutation, and in five unrelated subjects with secondary polycythemia. We next examined granulocyte transcripts of HIF-regulated genes: TFRC , SLC2A1 , VEGF , BNIP3 and HK1 , and found them to be increased in all PV patients and all studied polycythemic patients with VHL , HIF2\u03b1 or LNK mutations, but not in polycythemic EPOR Q434X patients or five patients with secondary polycythemia. Increased transcripts of HIF regulated genes are compatible with the previously unappreciated Warburg effect in PV (see S. Sana's Abstract at this ASH meeting). We propose that increased expression of RUNX1 and NF-E2 is not specific for myeloproliferative neoplasms but also is not universal for primary polycythemic disorders. Therefore, increased expression of RUNX1 and NF-E2 do not seem to be underlying mechanism for MPNs development but rather represent factors associated with diverse primary polycythemia states with augmented HIF signaling.
