    "abstract_text": "Background Brentuximab vedotin (BV) is a novel antibody drug conjugate consisting of an anti- CD30 IgG1 antibody, cAC10, linked to monomethylauristatin E, a potent inhibitor of microtubule polymerization. It is approved for treatment of relapsed classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in the US (FDA; 8/2011) and Europe (EMA; 10/2012). Peripheral neuropathy was the most frequent treatment-related adverse event (AE) in phase II trials, and the most common Grade 3 or higher toxicity apart from cytopenias. Although abdominal pain has been observed in up to 25% of all patients, pancreatitis is a previously unrecognized AE. We now report 8 cases of BV-associated pancreatitis, 2 of them fatal. Methods Following a grade 5 AE from pancreatitis in a patient receiving single-agent BV on an ongoing clinical trial (NCT01476410), collaborating investigators examined their collective cases of pancreatitis associated with BV. Lymphoma specialists at other centers were solicited for additional events. IRB or Ethics Committee approval as required was obtained in all cases. AE's reported to the FDA Adverse Event Report Systems (FAERS) from 6/2011-7/2013 were also examined. Data was collected and analyzed through the Research on Adverse Drug Events and Reports Project. Immunohistochemical staining with the anti-CD30 antibody BER-H2 (DAKO) was performed on residual normal pancreas from one of the fatal cases and normal control pancreas. Results Eight cases of BV-associated pancreatitis were identified by collaborators, and one additional report with limited information was listed in FAERS. Demographic, treatment and AE information for the eight complete cases is detailed in Table 1 . In all cases, BV was administered as a single agent. In seven cases, the dosing was 1.8 mg/kg every 21 days with a maximum of 180 mg; in one case, BV was administered weekly at 1.2 mg/kg (days 1,8,15, q 28). Two patients were retreated with BV after resolution of pancreatitis; one had no further evidence of pancreatitis and proceeded to a stem cell transplant, whereas the other patient, having recovered from Grade 4 pancreatitis, experienced a second episode (Grade 3). All patients demonstrated clinical evidence of pancreatitis as manifested by severe abdominal pain and nausea. In addition, all patients had biochemical and radiologic evidence of pancreatitis. Notably, no patient had an antecedent history of excess alcohol use or radiologic evidence of biliary pathology. Two patients developed progressive and fatal multiorgan dysfunction as a consequence of acute pancreatitis. An autopsy performed on one of the two fatalities showed evidence of acute necrotizing pancreatitis as the cause of death; diffuse pancreatic parenchymal necrosis and fat necrosis were seen but no cholelithiasis. Although the anti-CD30 antibody BER-H2 was previously reported to stain normal pancreas (BLOOD 1989 74:1678), routine immunohistochemical staining for CD30 on both the patient pancreas and normal pancreas controls were negative.

View Large Conclusion This is the first series describing pancreatitis as a rare, but serious and potentially fatal toxicity related to BV. Pancreatitis has been previously reported with other microtubule inhibitors such as taxanes and vinca alkaloids, but the mechanism, as with BV, remains unclear. Genetic factors that predispose to both acute and chronic pancreatitis have been reported and may underlie a susceptibility to this uncommon complication of treatment with BV. Clinicians prescribing BV should evaluate patients who present with abdominal pain for pancreatitis, and should consider pre-treatment biochemical assessments with serum lipase and/or amylase. Disclosures: Off Label Use: Brentuximab Vedotin is approved for relapsed, refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma in patients who have already had a transplant or are ineligible for one, or for patients with relapsed, refractory anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Patients treated on clinical trials or off label will be included in this presentation. Evens: Seattle Genetics : Consultancy, Honoraria. Fenske: Seattle Genetics: Consultancy.
