    "abstract_text": "Background/methods: Identifying relapsed or refractory (RR) classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) patients (pts) eligible for lower-intensity second-line therapy (SLT) will aid in improving short-term and long-term treatment-related toxicity. We conducted a phase II study evaluating PET-adapted SLT with single-agent brentuximab vedotin (BV) followed by augICE (augmented ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) for BV-na\u00efve patients with RR cHL (Lancet Oncology 2015). In this study, patients who failed 1 line of therapy for cHL were treated with 2 or 3 cycles of BV, 1.2mg/Kg, administered weekly, 3 weeks on and 1 week off. Those who achieved PET-normalization proceeded directly to consolidation with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Those with persistent abnormalities on PET received 2 cycles of augICE prior to consideration for ASCT. At 3-year follow-up, outcomes for patients who achieved PET-normalization following BV alone or BV followed by augICE were identical. Furthermore, baseline metabolic tumor volume (bMTV) predicted outcome and improved the prognostic significance of pre-ASCT PET (Blood 2017). We now report 6-year follow-up from this study evaluating PET-adapted SLT with BV and augICE. Results: 65 pts enrolled onto this protocol, of whom 18 achieved PET-normalization (Deauville \u2264 2) after single-agent BV. These 18 pts included 8 (44%) with primary refractory disease, 7 (39%) with advanced stage disease, and 8 (44%) with extranodal disease. 17 of the 18 pts proceeded directly to ASCT and 1 pt experienced delay resulting in disease progression. That individual achieved PET-normalization following additional salvage chemotherapy (gemcitabine/vinorelbine/liposomal doxorubicin) and proceeded to ASCT. Of the other 47 pts who remained PET-positive after single-agent BV, 35 achieved PET-normalization after augICE, 9 remained PET-positive after augICE, 2 received no additional treatment before proceeding to ASCT (1 pt with Deauville 3 response to BV, 1 with Deauville 4 response), and 1 pt withdrew consent and was lost to follow-up. 64 of 65 pts proceeded to transplant and median post-ASCT follow-up is 5.98 yrs (range 4.4-7.2 yrs). 6-yr overall survival is 86%, 6-yr progression free survival (PFS) is 73%, and 6-yr time to tumor progression (TTP) is 78%. Overall, there have been 8 deaths, which were due to disease progression (n=5), progressive multifocal leukencephalopathy (PML) (n=1), treatment-related respiratory failure (n=1), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n=1). Pts who proceeded to ASCT following single-agent BV achieved durable remission with 6-year TTP of 80%. Outcomes for the BV-only group were similar to those who required BV and augICE to become PET-negative (6-yr TTP 82%) and were more favorable than for those who remained PET-positive after BV and augICE (6-yr TTP 56%, p=0.058) (Figure 1). With 6-yr follow-up, bMTV > 109.5 cm 3 remained prognostic for the entire group and aided in predicting which pts ultimately developed disease progression. In particular, among the pts who achieved PET-normalization with BV alone prior to ASCT, 6-yr TTP was 92% vs 40% for low and high bMTV respectively, p=0.017 (Figure 2). Similarly, for pts who achieved PET-normalization following BV and augICE, 6-yr TTP was 85% vs 33% for low and high bMTV respectively, p=0.002. Conclusions: For pts with RR cHL, long-term remission can be achieved following lower-intensity SLT with single-agent BV followed by ASCT, provided PET-normalization is achieved after single-agent BV. bMTV identifies which pts within this favorable group are likely to develop disease progression and therefore treatment strategies using bMTV to direct intensity of therapy should be explored.
