    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2597 Poster Board II-573 Introduction: Activating mutations of the Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 gene ( FLT3 ) occur in approximately 30\u201340% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. FLT3 mutations confer numerous oncogenic properties, including dysregulated proliferation, resistance to apoptosis and a block in differentiation. FLT3 mutations result in abnormal activation of the downstream pathways, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (Mek)/extracellular signal\u2013regulated kinase (Erk) and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt. Activation of these downstream effectors has been thought to allow leukemia cells to evade apoptosis. Targeting of FLT3 mutations is a promising approach to overcome the dismal prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with activating FLT3 mutations. Current trials are combining FLT3 inhibitors with p53-activating conventional chemotherapy. The mechanisms of cytotoxicity of FLT3 inhibitors are poorly understood. We investigated the interaction of FLT3 and p53 pathways after their simultaneous blockade using the selective FLT3 inhibitor FI-700 and the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 in AML. Results: FI-700 induced G1-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis as evidenced by increased sub-G1 DNA content and phosphatidylserine externalization in FLT3/ITD MOLM-13 (FLT3-ITD, wild-type (wt)-p53) and MV4-11NR (FLT3-ITD, mutated-p53) AML cells. FI-700 did not affect cell cycle distribution patterns nor did it induce apoptosis in FLT3/WT OCI-AML-3 (FLT3/WT, wt-p53) and HL-60 (FLT3/WT, del (del)-p53). Wt-p53 MOLM-13 and OCI-AML-3 cells were susceptible to Nutlin-induced apoptosis. FI-700 augmented Nutlin-induced Bax activation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss, caspase-3 activation and phosphatidylserine externalization in MOLM-13 cells. FI-700 rapidly reduced Mcl-1 levels in FLT3/ITD cells, mainly by enhancing proteasomal Mcl-1 degradation. Levels of other Bcl-2 family proteins examined did not change significantly. Mcl-1 levels were only modestly reduced upon Nutlin treatment. The FI-700/Nutlin-3 combination profoundly reduced Mcl-1 levels. Immunoprecipitation/ immunoblotting results suggested that the drug combination results in a profound decrease in Mcl-1-bound Bim. FI-700 enhanced doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in FLT3/ITD MOLM-13 and MV4-11NR cells, suggesting that FI-700 can enhance both the p53-dependent and the p53-independent apoptotic effects of doxorubicin. Finally, cooperative apoptotic effects of FI-700/Nutlin-3 were seen in primary AML cells with FLT3/ITD. Conclusion: FLT3 inhibition by FI-700 immediately reduces anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 levels and enhances Nutlin-induced p53-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis in FLT3/ITD-expressing AML cells via the Mcl-1/Noxa axis. FLT3 inhibition, in combination with p53-inducing agents, might represent a potential therapeutic approach in AML with FLT3/ITD. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
