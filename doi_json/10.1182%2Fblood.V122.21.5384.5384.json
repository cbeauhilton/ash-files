    "abstract_text": "Objective To observe the short-term treatment effect of Huachansu Injection combined with CEMT regimen on patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and evaluate the quality of life of the patients. Methods The 40 patients of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma were divided into two groups, 20 patients were in the Chinese and western medicine treatment group, the rest in the control group. The patients in the control group received the CEMT regimen (Carboplatin, Etoposide, Methotrexate, and Thalidomide);and those in the Huachansu group received Huachansu injection on the basis of the CEMT treatment. The Huachansu injection in the 500ml 5% Glucose injection was given by intravenous drop once daily, 10\u0081'20ml for each time. The general treatment lasted 3 months and one treatment period was 4 weeks,during each period the patients received the\u00a0 medicine treatment for 7 days and had a rest for 2 days. The patients in each group were given the syndrome differentiation type of traditional chinese medicinal broth,decoction, once a day. The QLQ-C30 Quality of Life Questionaire(Chinese Version V3.0for clinical use) worked out by EORTC(European Organization For Research And Treatment Of Cancer) was adopted to evaluate and research the patients\u2019 quality of life before and after the treatment. Results 5 cases had complete remission,6 had part remission, 2 had stable and 7 cases had progresss and the total effectiveness reaches 65.0% \u00a0in the Huachansu group group. In the control group, 3 cases had complete remission,4 had part remission, 1 had stable and 12 had progress and the total effectiveness reaches 40.0%. The effective rate of Huachansu group is higher than the control group,and the differences was statistically significant(P<0.05).\u00a0 The quality of life questionaire result also shows that the overall health status and the overall life quality of the patients in both groups have been improved as well as the patients\u2019 physical and mental status. The difference in the patients\u2019 life quality is less obvious in both groups. The 3-month treatment on their role functions and social functions have no outstanding effects after comparation. Conclusion The Huachansu Injection combined with CEMT regimen not only\u00a0 has excellent effect on on patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma,but also improves the quality of life of patient.
