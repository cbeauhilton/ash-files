    "abstract_text": "Plasma cell leukemia (PCL) is an aggressive and rare hematological malignancy that can originate either as primary disease (pPCL) or as a leukemic transformation of multiple myeloma (MMLT). We report here on the clinical characteristics, survival and genetic studies of 80 patients with PCL treated at a single institution (including 41 with pPCL and 39 with MMLT) and make comparisons with 439 newly diagnosed cases of multiple myeloma (MM). From our results pPCL presents a decade earlier than MMLT (54.7 vs 65.3 years) and despite substantially poorer clinical and laboratory parameters at presentation (hepatomegaly 32% vs 11%, leukocytes 31.6 vs 20.9, \u03b22M 8.5 vs 4.3) pPCL appears more responsive to conventional combination chemotherapy (VAD, VBMVP or VBAP) than MMLT and is associated with significantly longer survival (median 18.4 vs 3 months). Comparison of pPCL groups treated with combination chemotherapy (n=21) or with other regimens (40% MP, 10% Thal/Dex, 20% other, 30% none)(n=20) identifies no substantial pre-treatment differences between the groups although a higher proportion of patients who received combination chemotherapy subsequently proceeded to stem cell transplantation (30 vs 10%). Importantly, survival of pPCL patients treated initially with combination chemotherapy (median 13.9, mean 27.3 months) was significantly longer compared with patients who did not receive combination chemotherapy (median 5.2, mean 9.9 months)(p=0.035) with 2 long term survivors (> 7 years) in the chemotherapy group. By comparison, patients with MMLT received less active therapy for their leukemic disease than did patients with pPCL (21% VAD, VBMVP or VBAP; 18% MP). Treated MMLT patients showed selection bias for younger age (60.9 vs 66.4 years) and lack of bone disease (0 vs 65%)(p<0.01); however despite this, median survival was disappointingly short for MMLT patients in the treatment group and was not significantly improved compared with non-treated patients (2.3 vs 0.8 months)(p=0.34). Assessment of novel therapies in PCL is therefore urgently required. Karyotype analysis and targeted genetic studies demonstrate that IgH translocations are present with high frequency in both pPCL and MMLT (71 vs 86%) compared with MM (~50%). Notably, IgH translocation in pPCL is almost exclusively targeted at chromosome 11 (cyclin D1) belying its importance in establishing the phenotype. IgH translocation in MMLT is primarily to chromosome 11 [71%], but also targets chromosomes 4 (FGFR3/MMSET) [13%] and 16 (cMaf) [20%], recapitulating MM. Abnormalities of chromosomes 3,5,7,9,11,13,15 and 19 are present equally in all 3 disorders. Deletion of 17p13 (p53) shows strong selection pressure in the leukemias (pPCL 53.8%, MMLT 48.8%, MM 10.7%) and is complemented by p53 mutation (23%). Notably, pPCL tumors show lower rates of Ras mutation (12 vs 40%) and p14 (0 vs 31%) or p16 (25 vs 40%) promoter methylation than MMLT. Together these results therefore indicate that pPCL and MMLT are fundamentally different plasma cell disorders with distinctive biology, genetic abnormalities and treatment responses.",
