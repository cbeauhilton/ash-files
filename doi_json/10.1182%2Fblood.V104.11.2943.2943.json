    "abstract_text": "Background : Point mutations in the Abl kinase domain are associated with resistance against imatinib. Strategies to overcome resistance include dose escalation, combination treatment using imatinib with conventional or other developmental agents or, in the future, imatinib may be replaced by other tyrosine kinase inhibitors which work effectively against mutated clones. Mutational profiling of the BCR-ABL kinase domain will in this scenario become an important analysis as a supplement to BCR-ABL quantitation and may provide the rational basis for therapy, once resistance is diagnosed. Our group reported recently a sensitive, single step PCR assay for quantitation of mutated clones based on the ARMS principle. Aim : We describe an optimized, two step analysis for high sensitivity screening of mutated clones associated with resistance against imatinib targeting all P-Loop mutations, the T315I and M351T. Methods : In a first conventional PCR-reaction a cDNA-region spanning the BCR-ABL breakpoint is amplified resulting in an isolation of the BCR-ABL kinase domain for further analysis. An aliquot is then analysed in a second PCR step, conducted on the real time PCR Taqman platform. Selectivity for the mutated clone is conferred by the amplification refractoriness of non complementary primer 3\u2032-ends (ARMS principle). By introducing potent nucleotide-mismatches in position n-2, selectivity of the assay could be further increased. Even in the P-Loop region, which is known to be a difficult PCR template, misannealing could be reduced to an acceptable level. Results : Assays targeting all P-Loop mutations inclusive the T315I and M351T were tested by analysis of patient samples diluted in normal cDNA and non-mutated BCR-ABL and plasmid dilutions, containing the targeted mutation in a background of wildtype plasmids. Generally a 1:1000 dilution of mutated templates could be detected (sensitivity 0.1%). For some mutations even higher sensitivity could be achieved (0.01%). The level of sensitivity is generally higher than reported for other methods described before. The first PCR step can be conducted in parallel to other PCR-based detection strategies. The second step can be run simultanously to Taqman based BCR-ABL quantitation. This makes the described assay the ideal supplement to general mutation detection approaches like D-HPLC or sequencing strategies. Compared to the single step assay we desribed before, the two step approach increases sensitivity with one or two log factors. Conclusion : The described assay may be suitable for highly sensitive detection of mutated clones in resistant CML patients as a supplement to less sensitive general screening approaches and BCR-ABL quantitation.",
