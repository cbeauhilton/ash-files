    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Collection of valid data in patients with hematologic malignancies remains a challenge. Especially low grade malignancies require long term follow-up and valid high quality data. The RMG registry was established in 2007 and has become one of the flagship projects of the Czech Myeloma group. To date, four parts of the registry are active - module for multiple myeloma (MM), monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance (MGUS), AL amyloidosis (ALA) and Waldestr\u00f6ms macroglobulinemia. The later two has been started in 2014. Aim: To analyze current status of the registry in terms of amount of contained data. Methods: All patients must sign a written consent before entering their data into the registry. Data concerning diagnosis, demography, treatment and survival are regularly collected and updated into the registry via online system at https://trials.cba.muni.cz/trialdb2/interface_forms/login_rmg.asp. The data from MGUS patients are retrospective and prospective, data from MM patients are only prospective (since 2007). Registry is regularly monitored and data are validated by an external monitor. Results: There are 22 participating centers as of July 2015 (18 from the Czech Republic and 4 from Slovakia). Data from 4549 patients with MM, 2168 with MGUS, 121 patients with WM and 22 with ALA have been collected. Together 6860 patients have been included in the registry as of July 2015. Median follow-up of MGUS patients is 4 years (0-35 years) and median follow-up for MM patients is 2 years (0-32 years). The huge amount of data allowed publication of treatment results of MM patients treated with bortezomid and thalidomide in the Czech Republic and regular analysis of patients treated with lenalidomide. Novel prognostic models for MGUS progression and asymptomatic myeloma have been created based on registry data (manuscripts submitted). Conclusion: The RMG is one of the largest registries in Europe. Its biggest advantage is collection of validated updated data which can be used to create rapid analyses in order to react to changing myeloma field. It helps us to create new guidelines and serves as a potent research tool. It can be also used to negotiate reimbursement with healthcare insurance companies and government regulatory authorities for novel drugs implementation into treatment standards.
