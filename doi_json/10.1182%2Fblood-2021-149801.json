    "abstract_text": "Background: Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-1 and -2 are TCA cycle-involved enzymes which convert isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate. Mutations that alter the enzymatic activity causes accumulation of a mal-metabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which results in inhibition of DNA methylation and tumorigenesis. IDH-1 and IDH-2 mutation are present in approximately 7-10% and 10% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), respectively. Recently, whole exome sequencing has been used for the next-generation sequencing of AML, and certain gene mutations have been identified in patients with AML. The treatment strategies for leukemia have undergone drastic changes with the rapid development of new drugs. However, the proper use of newly developed agents poses a major challenge in AML treatment. Genome profiling analysis can be used to select the optimal treatment for patients with newly diagnosed AML. IDH mutant-specific inhibitors such as ivosidenib and enasidenib were already approved in the US, and combination treatment with venetoclax and Azacitidine was recently approved in Japan. Methods and Results: We lunched an actionable mutation profiling multicenter study named Hematologic Malignancies (HM)-SCREEN-Japan 01 (UMIN000035233), in which a comprehensive genomic assay was performed by Foundation One Heme (F1H) panel. The primary outcome was the frequency of each genomic alteration, as determined using F1H, which is a comprehensive genome profiling test based on next-generation sequencing, in the AML specimens. The secondary outcome was the association between each genomic alteration and the clinicopathological characteristics, prognosis, and quality of specimens used in the genetic analysis. The eligibility criteria were as follows: 1) histological diagnosis of AML through bone marrow aspiration; 2) fulfillment of either of the following conditions: i) newly diagnosed AML unfit for standard treatment (ND-unfit AML) or ii) R/R-AML; 3) sufficient sample collection via bone marrow aspiration; 4) Age of participants 20 years or above during registration; 5) provision of written informed consent by participants. Paraffin-embedded bone marrow samples were gathered from 17 Japanese faculties and the F1H reports were returned to the patients. The median turnaround time was 13 days (minimum 8 days). We found 13 patients (7.3%) with IDH1 mutation and 17 patients (9.6%) with IDH2 mutation out of 177 patients who joined this study and the F1H report was successfully returned. Only one patient had both mutations, and each mutation was mutually exclusive in all the other patients (Figure 1). The major amino acid alteration of IDH1 and IDH2 were R132C/G/H/L and R140Q/W, respectively. Frequently co-occurring mutations include FLT3 (44.8%), NPM1 (34.5%), DNMT3A (31.0%) and RUNX1 mutation (20.7%). Mutations of RAS pathway-related genes (e.g., KRAS , NRAS and PTPN11 ) were seen in 6 patients (20.7%). Any gene alterations didn't show statistically significant co-occurrence with IDH1 and IDH2 mutation. Serial genome profiling analyses were performed to evaluate the time-dependent changes in the genome profiles of patients administered FLT3 inhibitors, gilteritinib, and quizartinib for treating FLT3-mutated AML. Also in this cohort, we are examining the properties and distribution of IDH1/2 mutations during treatment with FLT3 inhibitors. In the several patients, expansion and persistence of IDH mutated clones seemed to be cause of resistance (Figure 2 as the representative result). The detailed clinical outcomes of AML patients with IDH1/2 mutations are under investigation. Conclusions: In our evaluation of the suitability of F1H for HM-SCREEN-Japan 01, we successfully identified IDH-1/2 mutation that can be used as therapeutic targets in AML, which have rarely been identified thus far.
