    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) represents the most common form of acute leukemia in adults. Despite the enormous efforts during the last decades treatment resistance is still observed at a high rate. Previous studies have shown that bone marrow stroma promotes an increased resilience of AML blasts towards chemotherapeutics. Furthermore, current data suggest that alterations of the malignant cells\u2019 metabolism could represent a strong determinant for the disease\u2019s (including AML) course and/or treatment resistance. In fact, a deregulated metabolism could lead to a reduced sensitivity towards therapy and it remains to be elucidated whether this is a mechanism contributing to the blast-protective effects elicited by the bone marrow stroma. Here, we sought out to characterize the impact of stroma cells on the AML blasts\u2019 metabolism. Methods and Results: The human bone marrow stroma cell-line HS-5 was utilized for establishing the in vitro niche model. We compared in our assays AML cell lines (THP-1, OCI-AML, and KG-1) as well as primary blasts cultured on a HS-5 monolayer or alone. In line with previous observations we could detect an increased proportion of AML cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle upon co-culture with HS-5. When evaluating the cells\u2019 metabolism we observed a shift towards glycolysis despite presence of oxygen, i.e. aerobic glycolysis or the \u201cWarburg\u201d-effect. Basal glycolysis as well as maximal glycolytic capacity upon blocking ATP production in the mitochondrial respiratory chain was increased. Respiration (including basal respiration, coupling efficacy, and maximal respiratory capacity) was not significantly affected. However, mitochondrial biogenesis appeared reduced. Increased glycolysis was accompanied by an increased up-take of fluorescently labeled glucose as well as an increased expression of glucose transporters. The expression of several glycolytic molecules found to be increased upon HS-5 co-culture. Noticeably, cell-to-cell contact was not a pre-requisite for the metabolic shift. Our data was further corroborated by direct observations from AML patients: AML blasts isolated from the bone marrow exhibited an up-regulated glycolysis as compared to their counterparts from the periphery collected at the same time point. Conclusion: Taken together, our data indicates a stromal cell-mediated metabolic shift in AML blasts towards aerobic glycolysis. This metabolic phenotype is linked to an unfavorable prognosis and increased chemo resistance. The underlying molecular pathways remain to be elucidated and could represent a promising target for future interventions. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
