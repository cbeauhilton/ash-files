    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4212 Primary Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) and non-malignant, non-cirrhotic portal vein thrombosis (PVT) are rare disorders with a considerable overlap in etiology. Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are the most frequent underlying prothrombotic factor in both entities. The JAK2 V617F mutation (VF) has been identified in over half of the individuals with MPN. Recently, a JAK2 haplotype, designated \u201846/1\u2019, has been described. Previous studies suggest that the JAK2 46/1 haplotype represents a disease susceptibility to MPN, independent of VF status. The aim of this study was to determine the role of the JAK2 46/1 haplotype in the etiology of BCS and PVT. Patients were recruited from the EN-Vie cohort, consisting of 163 BCS and 138 PVT patients, consecutively enrolled in nine European countries between October 2003 and October 2005. DNA was available from 116 BCS patients (50 males and 66 females; median age 38.1), 97 PVT patients (47 males and 50 females; median age 49.8) and 104 healthy controls (43 males and 61 females; median age 36.8). The JAK2 46/1 haplotype was tagged by the rs12343867 single nucleotide polymorphism. Frequency of the JAK2 haplotype 46/1 was higher in BCS (36%, p=0.06) compared to controls (27%), while similar in PVT patients (28%, p=0.89). When stratified for VF status, haplotype 46/1 frequency was higher in VF positive BCS (44%, p=0.01) and VF positive PVT patients (40%, p=0.06) compared to controls. Haplotype 46/1 frequency was similar in VF negative BCS (33%, p=0.29) and PVT patients (24%, p=0.47) compared to controls. VF negative BCS patients with a proven MPN also showed increased frequency of the 46/1 haplotype (56%, p=0.07). Logistic regression, adjusted for age and sex, showed an association between the 46/1 haplotype and risk of VF positive BCS (OR: 2.10; 1.16\u20133.80), VF positive PVT (OR 2.07; 0.95\u20134.52) and VF negative BCS patients with a proven MPN (OR 3.04; 1.02\u20139.06). We conclude that the JAK2 46/1 haplotype may be associated with BCS and that this was limited to patients with a proven MPN, independent of VF status. In PVT, the 46/1 haplotype was only associated with patients who were VF positive. This study was carried out on behalf of the European Network for Vascular Disorders of the Liver (EN-Vie).
