    "abstract_text": "T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is one of the most frequent hematologic malignancies resulted from gene mutations and/or genomic rearrangements that occur in T cell progenitors. The 5-year survival rate of T-ALL patients is less than 50%. Much efforts have been dedicated to decipher the molecular events underlying TALL transformation, with the goals to identify specific therapeutic targets and develop new and more effective drugs. As a member of JAK kinase family, JAK3 mutations can be identified in 16.1% of T-ALL cases, and JAK3 M511I mutation is the most common one within all JAK3 mutations. Activating JAK3 M511I mutation induced a lympho-proliferative disorder, that followed by a T-ALL-like disease. PHF6 mutation is one of the most common co-existing gene mutations with JAK3 in T-ALL patients. Co-mutation events of JAK3 and PHF6 account for 1.89%-10.0% in T-ALL cases. However, the role(s) of PHF6 and JAK3 co-mutations in tumorigenesis is unknown. Here in this study, we first analyzed the genetic data of 449 T-ALL cases from multiple clinical centers in which JAK/STAT mutations is about 21% of the total cases. Interestingly, we found that PHF6 mutations were significantly associated with JAK3 mutations in these T-ALL cases ( P<0.05) , and the JAK3 and PHF6 co-mutation occurred in 7.2% of the cohort. Significantly, the average survival time of PHF6 and JAK/STAT co-mutated group was much shorter than that of the single JAK/STAT mutated group ( P<0.05 ) or none-PHF6/JAK/STAT mutated group ( P<0.001 ). We generated Phf6 KO+JAK3 M511I mice by transplanting JAK3 M511I infected Phf6 Lin - cells into wild-type mice. All Phf6 KO+ JAK3 M511I mice succumbed to leukemia from 74 to 101 days after transplantation with significantly shorter survival time than that of Phf6 WT+ JAK3 M511I mice. The Phf6 KO+ JAK3 M511I mice showed more aggressive phenotypes of T-ALL than Phf6 WT+ J AK3 M511I mice, including higher counts of WBCs, neutrophils and lymphocytes in peripheral blood, as well as higher degree of extramedullary infiltration in spleen, liver, lung and brain. Extreme limiting dilution transplantation assays demonstrated a marked increase in leukemia-initiating cell activity in Phf6 KO + JAK3 M511I cells when compared with Phf6 WT + JAK3 M511I cells, supporting a role for loss of Phf6 in promoting leukemia blast self-renewal and proliferation. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of Phf6 in accelerating T-ALL development,we performed RNAseq to analyze the transcriptome programing changes associated with Phf6 in isogenic Phf6 WT + JAK3 M511I or Phf6 KO + JAK3 M511I T-ALL cells. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed up-regulated cell cycle in Phf6 KO + JAK3 M511I leukemia cells. We then performed Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and found that PHF6 associated with BAI1 gene. qPCR and Western blot showed that the mRNA and protein expression of Bai1/BAI1 were significantly decreased in Phf6 KO + JAK3 M511I cells in comparison with Phf6 WT+ JAK3 M511I cells. BAI1 has been reported to prevent MDM2-mediated P53 ubiquitination, and loss of BAI1 reduces P53 level. We found that the protein expression of BAI1 and P53 was decreased, and the ubiquitination of P53 was significantly increased in PHF6 knockdown (KD) MOLT-4 cells (T-ALL) when compared with the control cells. BAI1 overexpression in PHF6 KD MOLT-4 cells significantly increased P53 expression in PHF6 KD+BAI1 OE MOLT-4 cells when compared with that of PHF6 KD cells. It suggested that Phf6 deficiency increased BAI1-mediated P53 degradation. To confirm this, we treated Phf6 KO + JAK3 M511I mice with a JAK3 inhibitor (ruxolitinib) in combination with a MDM2 inhibitor (idasanutlin), and found a synergistic response of the treatment within a significant attenuation in leukemia burden in vivo . In conclusion, we found that PHF6 mutation frequently co-existed with JAK3 mutation in T-ALLs, and together they can drive an aggressive leukemia in mice model. Notably, PHF6 deficiency promoted JAK3-induced T-ALL progression by inhibiting BAI1-MDM2-P53 signaling pathway that is independent of JAK3-STAT signaling pathway. We further demonstrated that combination therapy by tofacitinib and idasanutlin can reduce the Phf6 KO and JAK3 M511I leukemia burden in vivo . Our study suggested that combinational usage of JAK3 inhibitors and MDM2 inhibitors may increase the drug benefit for T-ALL patients with PHF6 and JAK3 co-mutations.
