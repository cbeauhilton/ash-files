    "abstract_text": "M3258 is an orally bioavailable, potent, selective, reversible inhibitor of the large multifunctional peptidase 7 (LMP7, \u03b25i, PSMB8) proteolytic subunit of the immunoproteasome; a crucial component of the cellular protein degradation machinery, which is highly expressed in malignant hematopoietic cells including multiple myeloma. M3258 was previously shown to deliver strong in vivo preclinical efficacy in multiple myeloma xenograft models, as well as a more benign non-clinical safety profile compared to approved pan-proteasome inhibitors, exemplified by a lack of effects on the central and peripheral nervous systems and cardiac and respiratory organs. Here we describe preclinical PK/PD and PK/efficacy modelling which led to a prediction of the PK profile, and the efficacious and safe dose ranges of M3258 in human which were used to guide the design of the phase I dose-escalation trial of M3258 in >3 line relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients. Mouse, rat, dog and monkey PK, plasma protein binding and intrinsic clearance data were used to estimate a half-life of approximately 6 hours for M3258 in human. The human total clearance and volume of distribution for M3258 were predicted to be 0.033 L/h/kg and 0.28 L/kg, respectively, whilst oral bioavailability was estimated to be above 80%. LMP7 proteolytic activity was assessed as a PD readout in human multiple myeloma tumor cells xenografted to mice as well as in dog peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). A strong PK/PD relationship was observed for M3258 across both species. LMP7 inhibition by M3258 also correlated strongly with anti-tumor efficacy in multiple myeloma xenografts, with maximal efficacy observed at M3258 exposure delivering sustained inhibition of tumor LMP7 activity. Quantitative PK/PD/efficacy modeling predicted the biologically efficacious dose (BED) of M3258 upon oral application to be between 10 - 90 mg daily in human. By incorporating data from nonclinical safety studies, these data suggest an attractive human PK profile of M3258, enabling oral application, as well as an improved human therapeutic index compared to approved pan-proteasome inhibitors. M3258 is being investigated in a phase I, first-in-man, 2-part, open label clinical study designed to determine the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and early signs of efficacy of M3258 as a single agent (dose-escalation) and co-administered with dexamethasone (dose-expansion) in participants with RRMM whose disease has progressed following > 3 prior lines of therapy and for whom no effective standard therapy exists. Integration of these data will guide the selection of the BED for potential further clinical development of M3258. Disclosures Lignet: Merck Healthcare KGaA: Employment.
