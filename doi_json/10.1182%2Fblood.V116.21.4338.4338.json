    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4338 Background. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) presents with different outcome in children and adults, with event-free-survival (EFS) rates of 70\u201380% and 30\u201340% at 5 years, respectively. This reflects both a different disease biology and different therapeutic approaches. Recently, results apparently improved in young adults/adolescents aged 15\u201321 years, with de novo ALL, when treated with pediatric intensive regimens rather than with typical adult regimens. Similarly, clinical studies are ongoing in older patients, toxicity related-therapy seeming the limiting issue. Aims. We report a single centre experience on adult ALL patients treated with an intensive pediatric-inspired schedule, designed to assess its tolerability and efficacy. Methods. From November 2007 to June 2010 seventeen ALL patients (M/F=12/5) were treated at our Center according to a modified AIEOP LAL2000 regimen. Treatment consisted of 7 days steroid pre-treatment, and four drugs 78-days induction (phase IA and phase IB) after which high risk (HR) patients were treated with three polychemotherapy blocks, while intermediate (IR) and standard risk (SR) patients went on 8-weeks consolidation and subsequent delayed intensification. Allo-SCT was planned for all patients with HLA-matched donor, as alternative to 2-years maintenance therapy. Median age was 31 years (range, 17\u201347). According to cytogenetic, response to steroid and minimal residual disease patients were classified into HR (n=7), IR (n=6) and SR (n=4). Results. 15/17 patients completed the induction phase IA, two being out for toxicity (grade IV infection and intestinal occlusion). Twelve (71%) obtained a complete remission (CR); three were refractory. However, one of them subsequently achieved CR after polychemotherapy blocks, for an overall response rate of 76% (13/17). Eleven patients then completed the 28-days induction IB. One patient is ongoing. Median induction duration was 92 days (range 82\u2013136). Delays were mostly due to extra-hematological toxicity, the commonest being gastrointestinal (n=12), infective (n=7) and thrombotic (n=3). Delays were accumulated in both induction phases without significant difference between phase IA (median 18.5 days, range 4\u201337) and phase IB (median 17 days, range 9\u201366), despite an absolute number of moderate-severe AE superior in phase-IA versus phase-IB (12 vs 5). After induction, 4/12 patients already received consolidation therapy; 2/4 then received allo-SCT. The median duration of consolidation was 51 days (range 22\u201394). Conversely, 6/12 patients received polychemotherapy-blocks, one patient went directly on alloSCT and the remaining is ongoing. After polychemotherapy-blocks, five out six patients received allo-SCT. The median CR duration was 13 months (range 1+-42+); two patients relapsed, both after allo-SCT. With a median follow-up of 11 months (range 2\u201343) 11/17 (65%) patients are alive, 9 in CR (5 undergone allo-SCT). Six patients dead, three in CR for infectious complications, 3 for relapsed/refractory disease. Conclusions. Though in a small series, pediatric-like intensive chemotherapy seemed to be feasible in adult ALL. Extra-hematological toxicity, however, caused significant treatment delays during induction. Finally, the overall outcome appeared promising, though longer follow-up and larger populations are needed to draw definitive conclusions. Acknowledgments.
