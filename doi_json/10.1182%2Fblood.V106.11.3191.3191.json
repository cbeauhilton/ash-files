    "abstract_text": "To determine whether fetal hemoglobin (HbF) protects against activation of hemostasis, endotheliium, and circulating blood elements, infants, children and young adults with homozygous SS disease (n=35) were studied. F-cell numbers, biomarkers of endothelial activation (including sVCAM-1, sE- and sP-selectin), white cell and platelet activation (sL-selectin and sP-selectin respectively) and markers of hemostatic activation, including D-Dimer and prothrombin fragment F1.2 were analyzed. Subjects with HbSS demonstrated significant increases (P<0.001) in all cell activation and hemostatic biomarkers. Analyses revealed a dominant, statistically significant correlation between F-cell and biomarkers of endothelial, white cell and hemostatic activation. F-cells correlated inversely with sVCAM-1 (R = \u22120.64, P<0.00005), sE-selectin (R = \u22120.51, P = 0.03) and sP-selectin (R = \u22120.41, P<0.02). Since HbF protects against HbS polymerization, our data suggests a role for the sickle erythrocyte in endothelial activation and is consistent with reported decreases in sVCAM-1 following hydroxyurea therapy or a chronic transfusion regimen. sP- and sE-selectin levels correlated with neutrophil counts (R = 0.63 and R = 0.42, P<0.00006 and P<0.02 respectively) while no relationship between platelets and sP-selectin was noted. An additional correlation between sP- and sE-selectin (R = 0.50, P<0.003) was also observed, reflecting enhanced neutrophil-endothelial interaction as part of an inflammatory and prothrombotic HbSS phenotype. Surprisingly, a positive correlation between sL-selectin and F-cells occurred (R = 0.4, P<0.02) with the young infant with HbSS demonstrating higher levels of this leucocyte activation marker than the older subject. A dysregulation of L-selectin shedding following neutrophil activation has been proposed to occur in sickle cell anemia. Our results suggest that HbF protects against this dysregulation. D-Dimer levels correlated negatively with F-cells (R = \u22120.76, P<0.000001), with a striking relationship between D-Dimer and markers of endothelial activation, including sVCAM-1 (R = 0.53, P<0.001), sE-selectin (R = 0.39, P<0.03) and sP-selectin (R = 0.41, P<0.02). Such findings are in keeping with D-Dimer\u2019s well-documented role as a biomarker in other inflammatory and ischemia-related disorders including coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral arterial ischemic states. This report expands our knowledge regarding the protective effects of HbF against endothelial and hemostatic activation, and suggests a role for D-Dimer as a prothrombotic and proinflammatory marker in sickle cell anemia.",
