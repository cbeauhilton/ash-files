    "abstract_text": "Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) from healthy subjects can produce and store tissue factor (TF), which is expressed on PMN surface upon in vitro stimulation with P-selectin. We report here that platelets and PMN from 12 patients with myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) (6 Polycytemia Vera, 6 Essential Thrombocythemia) show up regulation of P-selectin and TF, respectively, in the absence of any in vitro challenge, in comparison to healthy subjects (31\u00b15 vs. 2.8\u00b10.4 percent of P-selectin-positive platelets and 6.4\u00b11.3 vs. 0.8\u00b10.3 percent of TF-positive PMN, both differences P<0.05). The number of circulating mixed platelet-PMN aggregates was also increased (15.1\u00b14.4 percent of platelet-PMN aggregates in MPD vs 2.6\u00b10.5 in healthy, P<0.05). PMN TF expression as well as mixed platelet-PMN aggregates, but not platelet P-selectin, were significantly reduced in six MPD patients after three weeks treatment with hydroxyurea (HU) (6.3\u00b11.7 vs. 1.4\u00b10.2 percent of TF-positive PMN and 25.1\u00b16.3 vs. 4.7\u00b11.1 percent of platelet-PMN aggregates, before and after HU, respectively; both differences P<0.05). In vitro studies performed on PMN separated from healthy donors confirmed HU effects (0\u20131,400 microM). HU prevented both P-selectin-induced TF expression and mixed cell aggregate formation. The inhibitory effect of HU was specific for P-selectin induced PMN activation, as it did not affect fMLP-induced PMN TF expression. Thus, in MPD patients, platelet P-selectin-mediated TF expression on circulating PMN may play a role in thrombus formation and represents a novel target for the antithrombotic activity of HU.",
