    "abstract_text": "Uteroplacental thrombosis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of fetal loss, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and preeclampsia. The role of inherited and acquired thrombophilias in such pregnancy complications is controversial. Recently, increased levels of circulating procoagulant microparticles (MPs) were related to fetal loss and preeclampsia ( Laude et al. Thromb Haemost  2001 ; 85 : 18 , Gonzalez-Quintero et al. Am J Obstet Gynecol  2004 ; 191 : 1418 )). In this study, we measured the level of MPs derived from endothelial cells, platelets, and monocytes by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies against CD31, CD41 and CD14, respectively in 262 healthy unrelated primipara with a spontaneous singleton pregnancy. Expression of tissue factor by a monoclonal antibody and phosphatidyl serine by annexin 5 on MPs were also measured. All women were followed from the 24 th week of gestation until delivery and IUGR, small for gestational age (SGA) at birth, pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) or preeclampsia (PE) or none of the above were recorded. Blood sampling was carried out at 24 th week of gestation. The levels of CD31 and CD41- positive MPs in women with and without the above pregnancy complications are presented in the table. Not shown are values of CD14, annexin 5 or tissue factor on MPs since their median levels were negligible in all study groups. There was no statistically significant difference in CD31 and CD41- positive MPs between women who developed or not the indicated pregnancy complications. Also, there was no significant difference in levels of these MPs between women with and without the common inherited thrombophilias, factor V Leiden and or prothrombin mutation (28 patients) and lupus anticoagulant (10 patients). These data indicate that measurement of the level of MP at the 24 th week of gestation has no predictive value for development of PIH, PE, IUGR or SGA.  . . . CD31 . . CD41 . . . . Number .
