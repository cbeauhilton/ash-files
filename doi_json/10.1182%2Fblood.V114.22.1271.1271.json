    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1271 Poster Board I-293 Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of lymphoma in humans. The aggressive activated B cell-like (ABC) subtype of DLBCL is characterized by constitutive NF-\u03baB activity and requires signals from CARD11, BCL10 and the paracaspase MALT1 for survival. CARD11, BCL10 and MALT1 are scaffold proteins that normally associate upon antigen receptor ligation. Signal-induced CARD11/BCL10/MALT1 (CBM) complexes couple upstream events to IKK/NF-\u03baB activation. MALT1 possesses in addition a recently recognized proteolytic activity that cleaves and inactivates the negative NF-\u03baB regulator A20 and BCL10 upon antigen receptor ligation. Yet, the relevance of MALT1 proteolytic activity for malignant cell growth is unknown. Here we demonstrate pre-assembled CBM complexes and constitutive proteolysis of the two known MALT1 substrates in ABC-DLBCL but not in germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL. ABC-DLBCL cell treatment with a MALT1 protease inhibitor blocks A20 and BCL10 cleavage, reduces NF-\u03baB activity and decreases the expression of NF-\u03baB targets genes. Finally, MALT1 paracaspase inhibition results in death and growth retardation selectively in ABC-DLBCL cells. Thus, our results indicate a growth-promoting role for MALT1 paracaspase activity in ABC-DLBCL and suggest that a pharmacological MALT1 protease inhibition could be a promising approach for lymphoma treatment.
