    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4071 Introduction: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder characterized by clonal expansion of single plasma cells in the bone marrow. Despite high-dose melphalan therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and the introduction of active drugs like bortezomib or lenalidomide that have been associated with improved survival MM is still incurable. Thus, the identification of novel molecular targets and additional treatment options are warranted. In B-cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) or diffuse large B cell lymphoma, the inhibition of the tyrosine kinase Syk gave promising preclinical and first clinical results.In our study, we analyzed the potential of Syk as a target in MM. Methods: The MM cell lines AMO-1, U266, MMS-1 and RPMI8226 and primary MM cells were treated with the Syk-inhibitors BAY61-3606 or piceatannol and proliferation, migration and apoptosis induction were analyzed. Effects on involved intracellular signaling cascades were determined by Western blotting. Results: Incubation of MM cell lines with Syk-inhibitors resulted in a reduced proliferation and and SDF-1 induced migration, that was accompanied by a concentration dependent inhibition of the MAP kinase signaling characterized by reduced phosphorylation of ERK an p38 molecules. Furthermore, the nuclear localized expression of the NF-kB members RelA and RelB was inhibited in treated cells. In addition, Syk inhibition induced apoptosis in MM cell lines and primary MM cells in a dose-dependent manner as demonstrated by flow cytometry, caspase-3 activity and PARP-1 cleavage. While there was no effect on the expression of xIAP, survivin or MCL-1, Syk inhibition reduced the expression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl molecules and increased the release of cytochrome c, indicating that the apoptotic cell death is mediated via the internal mitochondrial pathway. Combination of piceatannol with lenalidomide and orally bioavailable dual phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor NVP-BEZ235but not with bortezomib or dexamethasone enhanced the cytotoxic effects of the compound. In line with the results from previous experiments the addition of MAPK inhibitors PD98059, SP600125, U0126, SB202190 and SB203580 to piceatannol further increased the efficacy of Syk inhibition. Conclusions: Our results show that Syk inhibition might represent a promissing new treatment option in MM with an increased efficacy when combined with lenalidomide or MAP kinase inhibitors.
