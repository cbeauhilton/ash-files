    "abstract_text": "Background. TP53 mutations were described to have a negative impact on prognosis of patients with B-chronic lymphoid leukemia and diffuse large cell lymphoma. However, a role of TP53 mutations in high-grade B-cell lymphomas (HGL) is not well defined in context of other genetic aberrations. Materials and methods. 23 patients (7 males and 16 females) had diagnosis of HGL were treated in National Research Center for hematology, Moscow, Russia. Median age was 49 years old (30-76). 5 patients had HGL with c-MYC ( MYC-R ) and BCL2 genes rearrangements and 2 - HGB with MYC-R and BCL6 rearrangements. 17 (74%) patients had MYC-R , 11/23 (48%) had double expresser lymphoma (MYC\u226540%, BCL2\u226550%) (DE). Median of observation time was 29,1 months (6,3-99,8). 19 (82%) of patients had IPI score 3-5 points. 16 patients underwent LM-B-04 with rituximab (Table 1), 5 - R-(DA)-EPOCH, 2 - R-CHOP-21. In 5 cases autologous stem cell transplantation was performed. Sanger sequencing was performed to identify mutations in exons 5-8 of TP53 gene using DNA extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (\u00abExtra-DNA\u00bb kit, \u00abGenetechnology\u00bb LLC). Primers to TP53 gene were synthesized based on nucleotide sequences data available online on website ncbi.com by \u00abEvrogene\u00bb. To evaluate an influence of such factors as TP53 mutation ( TP53 mut), MYC-R, DHL, DE, gender, therapy on overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP) were performed multivariate dispersion analysis and Cox regression analysis (STATISTICA 10). Results: 8 (35%) cases with TP53 mut were identified: c.535C>T 45,6% p.H179Y, c.524G>C 15,6% p.R175P, c.743G>A 75,6% p.R247Q, c.487T>A 25,2% p.Y163N, c.824G>A 75% p.C275Y, c.713G>A 87,7% p.C238Y, c.745A>G 31,9% p.R249G, c.639A>G 41,8% p.R213R. 7/8 of them harbored MYC-R , 2/8 had DHL. In univariate (Picture 1, 2) and multivariate analysis pts harboring TP53 mut had worse OS (median OS was 6,2 (0,7-9,5) vs 25,5 (0,7-99,8) months, p=0,004) and shorter TTP (median TTP 3,5 (0,7-9,5) vs 23,1 (0,7-99,8) months, p=0,027) than patients without TP53 mut. DHL status had also an adverse effect on OS with lower significance than in pts with TP53 mut (p=0,022). Adverse effect of TP53 mut trends to play a role in combination with c-MYC gene rearrangement , thus5 pts TP53 mut/ MYC-R had shorter TTP than 5 DHL pts (3,4 (1,1-9,5) vs 7,3 (0,6-67,1) months, p=0,07). Conclusion: High-grade lymphoma has a more powerful and independent prognostic factor than double-hit status - TP53 mutation that contribute inferior prognosis. This factor shouldn't be underestimated in routine diagnostics because of its frequency and requirement of a different therapeutic approach.
