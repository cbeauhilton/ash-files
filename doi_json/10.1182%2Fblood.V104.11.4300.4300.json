    "abstract_text": "C/EBP\u03b4 belongs to the family of highly conserved CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) transcription factors. Members of this family play a critical role in the regulation of mitotic growth arrest and differentiation in numerous cell types. To examine the consequences of C/EPB\u03b4 expression , we transfected C/EPB\u03b4 into CML myeloid leukemia (KCL22, K562), prostate (LNCaP, PC3, DU145), and breast (MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines. C/EBP\u03b4 expression resulted in a proliferative arrest and an increase in apoptosis of the myeloid leukemia cells, as well as the prostate cells LNCaP and PC3, and the breast cells MCF-7 and T47D. In contrast, DU145 prostate and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were not inhibited by C/EBP\u03b4, indicating that the biologically properties of C/EBP\u03b4 depend upon its cellular context. We further studied the molecular mechanisms underlying the affect of C/EPB\u03b4 expression in CML leukemic cells. Myeloid differentiation of KCL22 and K562 blast cells as shown by morphologic changes and induction of secondary specific granule genes, occurred within 4 days of inducing expression of C/EBP\u03b4. Furthermore, expression of C/EBP\u03b4 was associated with downregulation of c-Myc and cyclin E, and upregulation of the forkhead transcription factor FoxO1a (FKHR) and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. In addition, microarray analysis showed that C/EBP\u03b4 mRNA is upregulated during granulocytic differentiation of normal CD34+ bone marrow cells, suggesting that C/EBP\u03b4 is involved in lineage-specific differentiation. Taken together, these results show that expression of C/EBP\u03b4 in BCR-ABL-positive CML cells in blast crisis, is sufficient for neutrophil differentiation and suggest that ectopic induction of C/EBP\u03b4 in the blastic phase of CML, as well as in certain cases of prostate and breast cancers, may hold promising therapeutic potential."
