    "abstract_text": "[Introduction] Acute megakaryocytic leukemia of Down syndrome (DS-AMKL) is characterized by excellent outcome with chemotherapy in contrast to non-Down syndrome-related AMKL (non-DS-AMKL). DS-AMKL and non-DS-AMKL have distinct genetic features which may underlie their different clinical characteristics. DS-AMKL is initiated by a GATA1 mutation in the transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) phase and developed with further mutations of other regulators, while non-DS-AMKL is a heterogeneous group which occasionally carry chimeric oncogenes. CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion gene is identified in about 30% of children with non-DS-AMKL, and reported as a strong poor prognostic factor in pediatric AMKL. However, CBFA2T3-GLIS2 has never been reported in DS-AMKL and adult AMKL patients. We performed genomic analysis of DS-AMKL including atypical case with difficult clinical course. This is the first report of DS-AMKL harboring the CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion gene. [Case] The patient is a 1-year-old female of DS-AMKL with no prior episode of TAM. G-banding analysis revealed the karyotype both of the leukemic cells and normal tissue sample; 47, XX, +21. Chimeric genes of AML1-MTG8, CBFB-MYH, DEK-CAN, MLL-LTG4, MLL-LTG9, MLL-ENL and abnormalities of KIT and FLT3 were not detected. The chemotherapy according to the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia / Lymphoma Study Group AML-D05 protocol, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, IDA-FLAG regimen (idarubicin, fludarabine, cytarabine, filgrastim) and clofarabine-based regimen were tried, but all of them failed to achieve complete remission (CR). She underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation and relapsed on day 35 after transplantation. Once she showed a response to azacitidine, but finally she died on day 293 after transplantation. [Materials and Methods] We performed whole transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq), SNP array analysis, mutational analysis of GATA1 in 6 DS-AMKL samples, which included this refractory sample and five DS-AMKL samples with GATA1 mutations. To analyze gene expression profiling, we applied the hierarchical clustering method and principal component analysis. [Results] RNA sequencing analysis identified a fusion gene involving exon 10 of CBFA2T3 and exon 2 of GLIS2 gene in this refractory sample. This fusion gene was a result of a cryptic inversion on chromosome 16 and the in-frame fusion of both genes. The fusion transcript was validated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by Sanger sequencing. Though SNP array analysis confirmed 21 trisomy, it did not identify other copy number aberrations. PCR analysis did not detect GATA1 mutation in this refractory sample, which can be identified in other DS-AMKL samples. Expression analysis elucidated DS-AMKL with CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion had distinct expression profile from DS-AMKL with GATA1 mutations. [Discussion] CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion is the most common chimeric oncogene identified in non-DS-AMKL children, but has never been detected in DS-AMKL patients. Patients with non-DS-AMKL, especially holding CBFA2T3-GLIS2 f usion gene, have poorer outcomes than DS-AMKL. DS-AMKL patients generally have GATA1 mutations, show high sensitivity to chemotherapy, and can be treated with less intensive chemotherapy. However, our case had no GATA1 mutation and could not achieve CR despite intensive chemotherapy and transplantation. Thus, it is suggested this fusion gene caused the resistance to chemotherapies including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in our case. Therefore, our case suggests patients with DS-AMKL should be surveyed genomic investigations including RNAseq and mutational analysis of GATA1 to identify their molecular biological subtypes before treatments are initiated. In case that fusion genes are detected in DS-AMKL patients, they must undergo highly intense chemotherapies, looking ahead to transplantation from the beginning of the treatment. Moreover, in case of harboring CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion gene, some potential therapies have been proposed, so that efficacy of such new therapies should be validated in a cell line-derived xenograft or patient-derived xenograft model. [Conclusion] DS-AMKL is generally known to show superior outcome, but DS-AMKL without GATA1 mutation and with CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion gene shows resistance to chemotherapies. For DS-AMKL patients, it is desirable to perform genomic analysis including RNAseq before chemotherapy. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
