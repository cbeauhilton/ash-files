    "abstract_text": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a kinase that regulates proliferation and apoptosis, has been extensively evaluated as a therapeutic target in hematologic malignancies. Rapamycin analogues, which partially inhibit mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), showed limited anti-tumor activity due to feedback mechanisms involving mTORC2 and incomplete inhibition of mTORC1. Thus, attention has turned to agents targeting both mTOR complexes by binding the mTOR kinase domain. The purpose of this study was to delineate the mechanisms of mTOR dual inhibitor induced apoptosis in human neoplastic lymphoid cells in vitro . MTS assays and propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometry for subdiploid populations demonstrated that OSI-027 and MLN0128 inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in a wide range of lymphoid cell lines including Jurkat, Nalm-6, Molt-4, and SeAX. Raptor and Rictor knockdown in Jurkat and Nalm-6 increased cell death, suggesting both mTOR complexes play a role in apoptosis. 4EBP1 phosphorylation was inhibited by mTOR dual inhibitors, but not by rapamycin. Expression of 4EBP1 T37A/T46A and 4EBP1 T37A/T46A/S65A/T70A, which mimic dephosphorylated 4EBP1, increased Puma mRNA and protein levels as well as apoptosis. Moreover, 4EBP1 knockdown abrogated mTOR dual inhibitor induced Puma upregulation and cell death, further supporting the role of 4EBP1 dephosphorylation in mTORC1 dependent apoptosis. In accord with the known dependence of c-Myc translation on the eIF4E/eIF4G complex, we also observed c-Myc downregulation after treatment with OSI-027, MLN0128 and 4EGI-1, but not rapamycin. Puma induction mirrored c-Myc downregulation under a variety of conditions, including expression of nonphosphorylatable 4EBP1 in parental Jurkat cells or wt 4EBP1 in 4EBP1 deficient cells. Furthermore, c-Myc knockdown induced Puma mRNA and protein as well as increased apoptosis. Collectively, these results support a model in which mTORC1 inhibition, acting through 4EBP1, induces Puma upregulation and apoptosis through c-Myc downregulation. In order to assess the parallel mTORC2-dependent Bim-mediated apoptotic mechanism, we utilized reporter assays and RNAseq experiments. OSI-027-induced Bim promoter activity decreased markedly when the nucleotides -29 to -18 were removed, suggesting that this response element is critical for OSI-027-induced promoter activation . In silico analysis identified eight transcription factors, including SP1, Egr-1, and Myb, that potentially bind this 12-bp region. In RNAseq experiments, we detected a 9-fold increase in Egr-1. Egr-1 upregulation was confirmed by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting after dual inhibitors treatment or Rictor knockdown. Moreover, dominant negative Egr-1 or Egr-1 knockdown diminished dual inhibitor-induced Bim promoter activation and Bim upregulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that OSI-027 enhances binding of Egr-1 to a region of the Bim promoter including bp -29 to -18, further confirming that Egr-1 functions as a direct transcriptional activator for Bim upon mTOR dual inhibitor treatment. NF\u03baB is a known transcription factor for Egr-1 and we observed increased p65 in the nucleus and increased NF\u03baB transcriptional activity after dual inhibitor treatment. Overexpression of S32A/S36A I\u03baB impaired the ability of dual inhibitors to induce NF\u03baB transcriptional activation, Egr-1 mRNA and protein, Bim promoter activation and Bim mRNA and protein upregulation. Collectively, these results suggest that mTORC2 inhibition induces Bim upregulation and apoptosis through NF\u03baB and Egr-1 transactivation. When fresh clinical ALL isolates were exposed to OSI-027 or MLN0128 ex vivo , inhibition of 4EBP1 phosphorylation along with upregulation of Egr-1 and Bim and/or c-Myc downregulation accompanied by Puma induction occurred, indicating that the pathways identified in ALL cell lines can also potentially be engaged in clinical ALLs. These observations not only provide new insight into the survival roles of mTOR in lymphoid malignancies, but also identify alterations that potentially modulate the action of mTOR dual inhibitors.
