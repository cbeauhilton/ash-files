    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2465 Background: The immunosuppressive molecule CD200 is upregulated on B-CLL and MM cells which may contribute to tumor immune evasion. Samalizumab is a novel first-in-class recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds CD200 and blocks CD200-CD200R interactions. Preclinical data suggest that CD200 blockade may inhibit CD200-dependent immune suppression, enabling a more efficient immune response against CD200+ tumor cells. A first-in-human phase I/II trial was initiated to evaluate safety, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of samalizumab. Methods: In this 3+3 design, dose-escalation trial, pts with advanced stage B-CLL or MM (with or without prior therapy) received a single IV dose of samalizumab. Pts could receive additional 28-day cycles (1 dose/cycle) if first dose was tolerated and pts exhibited at least stable disease (SD). Assessments performed throughout cycle 1 and then every 2 wks included standard safety measures, HAHA, PK, PD, CBC, and CT scans (at cycle 4 and every other cycle thereafter). Results: Results are reported as of 20-Jun-10. Enrollment is complete with 26 pts (18M; median age 67 yrs, range 41\u201387) including 3 MM pts (2 at 500 mg/m 2 , 1 at 600 mg/m 2 ) and 1 pt with SLL (500 mg/m 2 ). Four pts had no prior chemotherapy; the other 22 had received a median of 2 regimens (range 1\u20139). Twenty pts (1 MM) received multiple (2\u201314+) cycles of samalizumab (86+ cycles in total); safety and efficacy data are available for 25 pts through the 500 mg/m 2 cohort. Adverse events were mostly mild or moderate and manageable; the most common events were fatigue (48%), fever (20%) and rash (20%). Grade 3\u20135 events included neutropenia (12%) and infections (12%); no events were indicative of a cytokine storm. One non-drug-, non-CLL-related death occurred. Three pts developed HAHA. Although preliminary PK analyses ( Table 1 ) indicate high variability due to the limited number of pts and differences in tumor burden, the median AUC of serum drug levels after the first dose (300\u2013500 mg/m 2 ) are consistent with a linear relationship between dose and AUC. AUC in the low dose cohorts (50\u2013200 mg/m 2 ) is unreliable as most PK values were below the level of quantification. PD effects consistent with inhibition of CD200-dependent immune suppression by samalizumab were observed. Out of 21 pts with sufficient peripheral immune cells to evaluate, 18 (86%) showed 81\u201398% reductions in peripheral CD200+CD4+ T cells and 14 (67%) demonstrated 64\u201375% CD200 loss on B-CLL cells following the first dose. These responses were transient at lower doses (50\u2013200 mg/m 2 ) and sustained at higher doses (300\u2013500 mg/m 2 ), indicating a dose-dependent immunoregulatory effect. Eight of 21 evaluable pts (38%) showed an increase in CD200R+ CD4+ T cells. Regulatory T cell (Treg) levels decreased 20\u201357% (median = 38%) in 4/7 (57%) pts whose clinical disease stabilized or improved, whereas only 5/17 (29%) pts whose disease progressed clinically showed a similar decrease (13\u201362%; median = 18%). Modest first-dose Th1 cytokine responses were noted in 10/25 pts. Two pts who received \u2265 9 cycles showed reduction in tumor burden by CT scan (including 1 pt with a 58% reduction and near normalization of absolute lymphocyte cell count), associated with a reduction in Tregs and increase in activated T cells over time. No MTD was identified. Conclusion: Samalizumab appears to be well tolerated and exhibits a dose-dependent linear increase in serum AUC, dose-dependent changes in CD200+ B-CLL and CD4+ T cells, and modest Th1 cytokine responses. These PD effects are consistent with the predicted immunomodulatory mechanism of action. Anti-tumor activity is evident in some pts receiving multiple cycles. Treatment is ongoing with plans for additional studies of samalizumab to explore other dosing regimens. Table 1: Dosing, Safety, PK & PD Parameters by Cohort  Samalizumab Dose (mg/m 2 ) .
