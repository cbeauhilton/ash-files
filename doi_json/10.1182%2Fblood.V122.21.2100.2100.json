    "abstract_text": "Osteopetrosis (OP) is a genetic disease characterized by increased bone density due to osteoclast dysfunction, leading to life-threatening multi-systemic complications in early childhood. Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative approach for most children with OP and can effectively prevent serious complications such as blindness, bone fractures, hydrocephalus and cranial nerve compression. Since timing of transplant is critical in OP, umbilical cord blood is an attractive stem cell source, due to its prompt availability. We analysed the outcomes of unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) in 45 children with osteopetrosis transplanted in EBMT centers between 1996 and 2012, using data reported to Eurocord. Median age at UCBT was 6 months (1.1 month - 7.4 years). Donor-recipient pairs were matched at HLA-A and -B (antigen level) and DRB1 (allelic level) in 14 or HLA mismatched at 1 (n= 23) or 2 (n= 7) loci. Information on conditioning regimen was available for 42 patients; it was myeloablative (mostly busulfan-based) in 40 children and reduced intensity in 2 patients. GvHD prophylaxis consisted mainly of cyclosporine combined with either prednisolone (n= 20), or methotrexate (n=6), or mycophenolate mofetil (n=3). Anti thymocyte globulin (ATG) or alemtuzumab was given to 37/40 patients. Median number of infused total nucleated cell (TNC) and CD34+ was 13x10 7 /kg and 3.4x10 5 /kg, respectively. Median follow-up for survivors was 44 (range 4-144) months. Neutrophil recovery with donor chimerism was documented in 27/45 patients; 19/25 evaluable patients presented full donor engraftment, while 6 children presented mixed donor chimerism. Median time to neutrophil recovery was 20 (range 10-60) days. Eighteen patients experienced graft failure and 3/18 are alive at last follow up. Information on treatment post-graft failure was available 7/18 children: 6 patients underwent a second HSCT and 3 of them survived. Stem cell dose was associated with a trend for a better probability of donor engraftment: the cumulative incidence of donor engraftment was 46% in patients who received a CD34+ cell dose<2 x 10 5 /kg, versus 71% in children receiving a CD34+ cell dose \u22652x10 5 /kg (p = 0.09). Eleven patients developed grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD: n=6 grade II, n=4 grade III, n=1 grade IV) and 5 patients chronic GVHD (cGvHD: n=3 limited, n=2 extensive). Overall survival (OS) at 3 years was 45+8%. Twenty-four patients died after UCBT due to: infections (n=13), acute respiratory distress syndrome (n=2), veno occlusive disease (VOD), (n=2) hemorrhage (n=2), or other causes (n=5). VOD was observed in 7/26 evaluable patients. Stem cell dose and HLA disparity were the only predictors of superior outcome in univariate analysis. The 3-year probability of OS was 50% in patients who received grafts with a CD34+ cell dose >2x10 5 /kg versus 0% in children receiving grafts with a CD34+ cell dose < 2x10 5 /kg (p=0.001). According to HLA disparities, 3-year probability OS was 54% versus 58% versus 0% in patients receiving a 6/6, 5/6 and 4/6 HLA-mismatched graft, respectively (p=0.01). Interestingly, 4/4 children receiving a treosulfan-based myeloablative regimen achieved donor engraftment and 3 children are alive at last follow up. These data suggest that transplantation of unrelated UCB is a valid alternative for children with OP without a matched sibling or a suitable matched unrelated adult donor. The use of CB units mismatched at >1 HLA locus should be avoided due to worse survival. The incidence of primary graft failure was high and therefore the optimization of the conditioning regimen and/or the use of CB units containing a high TNC and CD34+ cell dose must be considered in this setting. The use of treosulfan-based conditioning regimens is worth further investigation, as well as the use of defibrotide prophylaxis to reduce the risk of VOD in this population of high risk patients.
