    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4769 From 1980 to 2005 in our institution we've diagnosed and treated 361 patients (pts) affected by Hodgkin's disease. At the moment of diagnosis the median age of the patients was 29 years (range 13-69).About 72% of patients were in the stage I-II and 28% were in the stage III-IV. More than 54% of all patients received ABVD, 17% received MOOP, 10% MOOP/ABVD, 3% VBM and 1% received Stanford V scheme. Over 70% of all patients received radiotherapy (RT) with median dose of 4500 cGy (range 1000-16210). Over 94% of all patients obtained a Complete remission, however 11% relapsed. 130 patients among 361 are at this moment evaluable for late effects of chemo-radiotherapy.26 pts were treated in the period 1980-84 (25%) ; 6 pts treated 1985-89 (4,6%);21 pts treated in 1990-94 (16,1%); 24 pts treated in 1995-99 (19%) and 35 pts in the period 2000-2005 (27%). 50 pts among 130 (38,5%) present late effects related to the therapy. 24 pts (48%) present heart disease: 13 pts (40%) Valvulopathy,8 pts (25%) Ischemic heart disease, 7 pts (21%) Congestive heart failure, 4 pts (14%) Pericardic disease. Therapies of these patients were performed : In 1980-89 (11 pts), 6 pts (25%) received MOOP + RT,2 pts (8,3%) received M/A and 3 pts only RT. In 1990-99 (7 pts), 3 pts(12,5%) received ABVD +RT, 2 pts(8,3%) received MA+RT, 1 pt(4,1%) received ABVD and 1 pt(4,1%) received M/A. In 2000-05 (6 pts), 2 pts (8,3%) received ABVD+RT and 4pts(16,6%) received only ABVD. 18 pts present Endocrinological-disease, in all cases, represented by hypothyroidism; 16 pts among 18 had done Chemoteraphy and Radiotheraphy, while 2 pts received only Chemotheraphy. Besides 8 pts show both endocrinological and cardiological disease; in these cases 3 pts (37,5) had done ABVD+RT, 4 pts (50%) MOOP+RT and 1 patient (12,5%) only RT. Furthermore 26/130 (20%) developed a second neoplasm. Conclusions In our population 38% of patients had developed secondary late effects and we assess that about 15% of our Hodgkin's population die for a secondary late effect of therapies Although there are many variables for the development of a late effect we think that this analysis could lead to try to reduce the late toxicities of treatments.
