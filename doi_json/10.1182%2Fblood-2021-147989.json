    "abstract_text": "LP-184, or (-)-hydroxyurea methylacylfulvene, is a potent DNA alkylating agent that effectively kills solid tumors. It belongs to the acylfulvene compound family known to induce DNA lesions repaired by the Transcription-Coupled Nucleotide Excision Repair (TC-NER) pathway. Here, we show that LP-284, the synthetic positive enantiomer of LP-184, exhibited the greatest and broadest hematologic cancer antiproliferative activities among the 6 acylfulvenes, including illudin S, illudin M, Irofulven (LP-100), the semisynthetic racemic LP-184, the synthetic negative enantiomer LP-184, and LP-284. The distinct pharmacological activities of LP-284 may be due to differences in metabolic activation, transport, or affinity to cellular macromolecules. To determine whether metabolic activation plays a role, we compared the correlation between the expression of Prostaglandin Reductase 1 (PTGR1), the NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase known to convert Irofulven into its active metabolite, and the IC50 of LP-184, Irofulven, and LP-284. We found that the expression level of PTGR1 is highly correlated with LP-184 (r=0.88, p=8.4e-20) and Irofulven (r=0.71, p=4.7e-10) sensitivity, but not with LP-284 (r=-0.01, p=0.93). We also found that the average expression level of PTGR1 is significantly lower in hematologic cancer cell lines (n=180) than in solid tumor cell lines (n=856), indicating the existence of an alternative LP-284 activator in hematologic cells. Next, we checked mutation status, RNA expression, protein expression, and DNA methylation of 489 oxidoreductases, but none of the enzymes was highly correlated with LP-284 activity. To further explore the potential clinical application of LP-284 in hematologic cancers, we conducted cell viability assays in 18 hematologic cancer cell lines and found that LP-284 exhibited nanomolar potency in acute lymphocytic leukemia (average IC50: 351 nM), chronic myeloid leukemia (average IC50: 360 nM), B-cell lymphoma (average IC50: 366 nM), and Multiple Myeloma (MM, IC50: 334 nM). We also investigated the therapeutic potential of LP-284 in combination with spironolactone in treating MM. Spironolactone, an FDA approved drug for hypertension, degrades one of the key TC-NER players ERCC3 in MM, which in turn makes cells more vulnerable to helix-distorting DNA lesions likely caused by LP-284. While Spironolactone alone didn't cause cytotoxicity to the MM cell line RPMI8226, it reduced LP-284 IC50 by 2.4 fold. Taken together, we have demonstrated the importance of stereochemistry in acylfulvene activity. LP-284, likely to be activated through a different route, is a unique and potent acylfulvene for hematologic cancers. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of the TC-NER pathway greatly promoted LP-284 cytotoxicity. We hypothesize that LP-284 induces DNA lesions, which may be lethal to TC-NER deficient cells and may block transcription of short-lived fusion genes that are essential for cancer cell survival until repaired. Therefore, our discovery of the novel enantiomer LP-284 may provide a targeted therapy option for hematologic cancers with compromised DNA repair.
