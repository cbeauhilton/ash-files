    "abstract_text": "Tightly associated factors V a and X a serve as the essential prothrombin-activating complex that assembles on phosphatidylserine (PS)-containing platelet membranes during blood coagulation. The binding of factor V a to PS membranes regulates assembly of the prothrombinase complex. The C-terminal domain (C2) of factor V a (residues 2037\u20132196 in human factor V a ) contains a soluble phosphatidylserine (C6PS) binding pocket flanked by a pair of tryptophan residues, Trp 2063 /Trp 2064 (Srivastava A, Quinn-Allen MA, Kim SW, Kane WH, Lentz BR. Biochemistry, 2001, 40(28): 8246\u201355). Our recent results have shown that mutating these Trp residues abolishes FV a2 -membrane binding, but does not affect the assembly and activity of the prothrombinase in the presence of 25% PS membranes or soluble C6PS. Our data also indicates that there is another site on factor V a2 that might be specific for PS or C6PS and might serve as a regulatory site for assembly or activity of the FV a2 -FX a complex. A pair of solvent exposed amino acids, Tyr 1956 /Leu 1957 in the C1 domain is located analogously to the critical Trp residues in C2. Recently, we showed that prothrombin activation in the presence of the factor V a mutant (Y1956, L1957) A was markedly impaired on phospholipid vesicles containing 10% or less PS but was essentially normal on vesicles containing 25% PS (Saleh, M., Peng, W., Quinn-Allen, MA., Macedo-Ribeiro, S., Fuentes-Prior, P., Bode,W. and Kane, WH. Thromb. Haemost. 2004,91:16\u201327). Our work aims to test the hypothesis that the PS regulatory site in V a2 is located analogously to the C6PS binding site in the C2 domain. We have used factor V a mutants with mutations in either the C1 domain, (Y1956, L1957) A or in both the C1 and C2 domains, (Y1956, L1957, W2063, W2064) A. We determine the rate of thrombin formation in the presence of 400 mM C6PS and wild type, C1 and C1C2 mutated factor V a2 to be 170, 12 and 11 nM/S \u22121 /M \u22121 , respectively. Mutations in the C1 and C1C2 domains of factor V a2 reduced the rate of activation of prothrombin to thrombin by 14\u201315 fold. We have also determined the effect of these mutations on the assembly of factors X a \u2013V a2 complex by monitoring the change in fluorescence of dansyl-glutamyl-glycyl-arginyl-chloromethylketone (DEGR-CK)-X a with the addition of wild type, C1 and C1C2 mutated factor V a2 in the presence of 400 mM C6PS. Our data shows that the K d \u2019s of factor X a with factor Va2 (wild type, C1 mutant and C1C2 mutant) are 3, 564, 624 nM respectively. Our results support the hypothesis that a PS regulatory site is located in the C1 domain of factor V a and includes residues Tyr 1956 and Leu 1957 .",
