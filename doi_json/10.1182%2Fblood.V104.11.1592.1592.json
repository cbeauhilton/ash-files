    "abstract_text": "Pyrimidine 5\u2032-nucleotidase type-I (P5\u2032N-1) catalyzes the dephosphorylation of UMP and CMP to their respective nucleosides. In red blood cells, the enzyme has a major role in the catabolism of nucleotides formed from RNA degradation. P5\u2032N-1 possesses also phospho-transferase activity suggesting an additional role of the enzyme in nucleotide metabolism. P5\u2032N-1 deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hemolytic nonspherocytic anemia, heavy basophilic stippling in the peripheral blood smear, and accumulation of pyrimidine nucleotides within the erythrocytes. P5\u2032N-1 deficiency is the third most common RBC enzymopathy causing hemolysis after G6PD and PK deficiency. Fourteen different mutations have been identified at the DNA level to date including four missense mutations. To increase our understanding on molecular basis of the P5\u2032N-1 deficiency, after mutants N190S and G241R (Chiarelli et al, Blood 2003, abstract; Chiarelli et al, The Hematology Journal 2004, abstract), we have undertaken the biochemical characterization of D98V and L142P enzymes, identified respectively in a Norwegian family and in Japanese patients. The proteins were produced in E. coli cells as recombinant forms, and purified to homogeneity. The L142P protein showed a drastic reduction in the thermal stability (t 1/2 at 37\u00b0C about 6 min compared to a fully stable wild-type), and kinetic properties slightly altered ( k cat values nearly halved and K m 3\u20135 times higher). D98V exhibited reduced heat stability (t 1/2 at 37\u00b0 about 25 min) and catalytic efficiency turned especially versus UMP (about 25 times) owing the increased K m values. Thus, the decreased activity observed in Japanese patients homozygous for the L142P mutation is essentially due to lowered enzyme levels caused by protein instability, whereas the D98V mutation of Norwegian patients alters both stability and catalytic efficiency. We suggest that substitution D98V affects an amino acid residue involved in substrates binding site."
