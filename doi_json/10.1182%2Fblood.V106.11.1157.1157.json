    "abstract_text": "In acute leukemia and intermediate/high grade lymphoma it is important to achieve a CR as early as possible. The aim of the study was to evaluate if the same is true in myeloma treated with intensive therapy including tandem transplants (Tx-1; Tx-2). A total of 668 patients were enrolled on our Total Therapy 2 protocol, which randomized patients upfront to intensive therapy with or without thalidomide. The protocol consisted of 4 induction cycles followed by tandem transplants, 1 year of consolidation chemotherapy and maintenance therapy with dexamethasone pulsing every 3 months for 1 year and interferon-\u03b1, if tolerated. This study is limited to the 570 patients who received at least one transplant. CR was defined as absence of serum and urine M-protein with negative immunofixation electrophoresis and < 5% bone marrow plasma cells. EFS analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier plots and log rank statistics to compare different groups. A 1 year landmark after Tx-1 was employed to compensate for guaranteed time of CR patients. Prior to Tx-1 89 patients (16%) were in CR, 111 in near CR (nCR), 110 in partial remission (PR) and 260 in < PR. After Tx-1, 170 (30%) achieved CR, 159 nCR, 116 PR and 125 < PR. The ultimate best response was CR in 319 patients (56%), nCR in 134, PR in 68 and < PR in 49. EFS of patients ultimately achieving CR was similar for those who were either in CR, nCR, PR or < PR prior to Tx-1 (p=0.47; Fig 1a). Patients in PR prior to Tx-1, but ultimately achieving CR or nCR faired considerably better than those who remained in PR (p=0.003 Fig 1b). Similarly, EFS of patients ultimately achieving CR was comparable for those who were either in CR, nCR, PR or < PR prior to Tx-2 (p=0.53). The same observations were made for both patients randomized to thalidomide or no thalidomide, or with and without baseline metaphase cytogenetics. With a median follow-up of 3 year after Tx-1 no difference in EFS was seen relative to the timing of achievement of CR. However, improvement of quality of response with further therapy resulted in a significant increase in EFS, strongly suggesting additional benefit from the second transplant and consolidation chemotherapy. 1a View large Download slide Event-Free Survival Comparing best Response Before TX1 To Best Response Overall (Landmark 12 months posts TX1) 1a View large Download slide Event-Free Survival Comparing best Response Before TX1 To Best Response Overall (Landmark 12 months posts TX1) 1b View large Download slide Event-Free Survival Comparing best Response Before TX1 To Best Overall Landmark 12 months posts TX1 1b View large Download slide Event-Free Survival Comparing best Response Before TX1 To Best Overall Landmark 12 months posts TX1"
