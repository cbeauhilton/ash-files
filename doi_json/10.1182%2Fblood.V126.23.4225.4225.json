    "abstract_text": "Background : The introduction of newer agents, such as lenalidomide (LEN) and bortezomib (BORT), has improved survival outcomes for pts with RRMM (Kumar et al Leukemia , 2014). However, overall survival (OS) in pts who have failed or progressed on treatment (Tx) with newer agents is short and there are few additional treatment options available (Kumar et al Leukemia , 2012). POM is a distinct immunomodulatory agent with tumoricidal and immunoregulatory effects approved in combination with DEX for the Tx of pts with RRMM in the US and EU with \u2265 2 prior Txs, including LEN and BORT. Pivotal trials with POM + LoDEX have demonstrated greater survival benefits when compared with high-dose DEX (MM-003; San Miguel et al Lancet Oncol, 2013) or POM alone (MM-002; Richardson et al Blood, 2014). The STRATUS trial (MM-010; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01712789; EudraCT: 2012-001888-78) is a single-arm, open-label, phase 3b study being conducted in 19 countries across Europe designed to further evaluate safety and efficacy of POM + LoDEX in RRMM. Here, we present an updated analysis of safety and efficacy. Methods : Pts with refractory or relapsed and refractory disease (progressive disease [PD] on or within 60 days of last prior Tx), Tx failure with BORT and LEN, and adequate prior alkylator therapy were eligible. Pts with the following laboratory values were excluded: absolute neutrophil count < 800/\u03bcL; platelets < 75,000 or < 30,000/\u03bcL for pts with < 50% or \u2265 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells as plasma cells, respectively; creatinine clearance < 45 mL/min; hemoglobin < 8 g/dL; and peripheral neuropathy (PN) grade (Gr) \u2265 2. POM 4 mg was administered days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle in combination with LoDEX 40 mg/day (20 mg for pts aged > 75 yrs) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 until PD or unacceptable toxicity. Thromboprophylaxis was required for all pts.Follow up continued for subsequent Tx, OS, and second primary malignancy until 5 yrs post enrollment. Safety was the primary end point, and key secondary end points included overall response rate (ORR) (\u2265 partial response), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), OS, and POM exposure. Results : A total of 682 pts were enrolled. The median age was 66 yrs (range, 37-88 yrs), and the median time since diagnosis was 5.3 yrs (range, 0.5-28.1 yrs). Pts were heavily pretreated with a median of 5 prior regimens (range, 2-18). Most pts were refractory to LEN (96%), BORT (84%), or LEN and BORT (80%). As of May 4, 2015, the median follow up was 16.8 mos and the median duration of Tx was 4.9 mos. In the 676 pts receiving POM + LoDEX, the most frequent Gr 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were hematologic events (neutropenia [49.7%], anemia [33.0%], and thrombocytopenia [24.1%]. The most common Gr 3/4 nonhematologic toxicities were pneumonia (12.9%), fatigue (5.9%), and hypercalcemia (5.0%). Incidences of Gr 3/4 venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and PN were low (1.6% and 1.5%, respectively). Dose reductions, interruptions, and discontinuations of POM due to TEAEs were required in 22.0%, 66.3%, and 6.1% of pts; respectively. The ORR was 32.6%, with 0.6%, 7.6%, and 24.3% of pts achieving a complete response, very good partial response, and partial response, respectively. The median DOR was 7.4 mos. Median PFS and OS were 4.6 mos and 11.9 mos, respectively (Figure). Conclusions : The updated safety and efficacy results of STRATUS, the largest study of POM + LoDEX in a heavily pretreated RRMM population, were in line with results from the pivotal trials demonstrating that POM + LoDEX is effective and well tolerated. This analysis confirms that POM + LoDEX is a standard of care for pts with RRMM.
