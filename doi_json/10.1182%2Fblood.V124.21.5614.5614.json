    "abstract_text": "Background: Haploinsufficiency of GATA2 results in familial immunodeficiency and MDS/ AML. We identified a family with a novel c1339A>C, pS447R germline GATA2 mutation. Unlike most other disease-causing GATA2 mutations, this mutation occurred in the non-zinc finger domain. Methods: After due IRB approval, clinical and laboratory data were retrospectively abstracted. Results: Seven family members with the mutation are being followed at our institution. (Table 1), of whom two have MDS, one MDS/AML and one with isolated neutropenia. At the time of diagnosis 5/7(71%) pt had decreased monocyte count. 4/7(57%) patients had decreased NK cell count and/or function. Only 1/7(14%) patient had decreased CD4 count. 3/7(42%) patients had reduced B cell numbers and 5/7(71%) patients had persistent HPV warts. Other infections include invasive Absidia sinusitis, infectious mononucleosis, pertussis, and blood stream infections with S. maltophilia and S.aureus. One patient had the Emberger's syndrome presenting with lymphedema and congenital pulmonary stenosis. Pulmonary manifestation included a patient each with decreased DCLO and hyperreactive airway disease. Genitourinary manifestations included pelvic kidney/dysplastic kidney, posterior urethral valve, dermoid cyst and hydrocele. Two female patients developed primary infertility. One patient had a history of appendicular carcinoid. 4/7(57%) patients have successfully undergone allogenic stem-cell transplantation. Conclusion: Germline GATA2 mutations are associated with a high frequency of MDS/AML. We describe a family with a non-zinc finger GATA2 mutation causing MDS/AML, with a spectrum of hematological and non-hematological manifestations, once again, highlighting the heterogeneity of this syndrome and expanding the genotype-phenotype correlation in this disease.
