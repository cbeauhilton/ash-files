    "abstract_text": "Introduction Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy involving terminally differentiated plasma cells. Its incidence in India is about 0.7/1,00,000 population amounting to about 6,800 new cases a year A number of genomic aberrations are associated with MM, most of which confer prognostic significance. Cytogenetic abnormalities are a part of R-ISS score for prognostication which stratifies presence of del(17p), t(4;14) or t(14;16) as stage 3, mSMART is another risk stratification tool which divides MM into high risk and standard risk groups based on genetic aberrations. Hence it is evident that determining the genetic abnormality in MM is important. however, due to limited resources genetic testing is not routinely done and the data in the Indian population is limited. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of molecular cytogenetic abnormalities by Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis in patients with MM and to assess the co-relation with response to induction chemotherapy, relapse and overall survival. Material and Methods: 64 patients were included from January 2016 to December 2019 and followed up till June 2020. Interphase FISH study was performed either at diagnosis or at relapse, on bone marrow aspirate with panel of probes consisting of CKS1B (1q21-22), CDKN2C (1p32.3), D13S319 (13q14.2/13q34), IGH (14q32.33), p53 (17p13.1) and trisomy (5p15/9q22/15q22) (trisomies are considered as hyperdiploidy in this study). Plasma cell purification techniques were not applied prior to FISH analysis. Patients were divided into 2 risk groups; 1) high risk group with presence of del17p, del13q, amplification 1q, del1p and two or more aberrations with either of these and 2) standard risk group with presence of hyperdiploidy or no genetic abnormality. There was no difference in chemotherapy regimen between the 2 groups; 46 (71.8%) received bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone, 10 (15.6%) received bortezomib-cyclophosphamide-dexamethasone, 2(3.1%) received bortezomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone, 1(1.5%) received daratumumab-bortezomib-dexamethasone and 5(7.8%) received 2 drug chemotherapy. Patients who did not complete minimum follow up of 6 months either due to death or lost to follow up were excluded from the study. Institutional Ethics Committee's approval was taken. Results: Mean age of the population was 60.33 years and male to female ratio was 1.65. 46.87%, 28.13% and 25% of the study population were in the age group of \u2264 60, 61 - 65 and \u226566 years respectively. 12.3%, 43.8% and 43.8% were in R ISS stage 1, 2 and 3 respectively. FISH analysis was done on 61 out of 64 patients (remaining 3 were excluded due to hemodilute bone marrow sample). 22 (36.1%) patients had abnormal genetic aberration on FISH analysis with 10 (16.39%) having two or more abnormalities. The frequency of genetic aberrations was as follows; amplification 1q (13/61, 21.31%), del13q (9/61, 14.75%), hyperdiploidy (7/61, 11.47%), del17p (4/61, 6.55%), IgH rearrangement (3/61, 4.91%), and del1p (1/61, 1.6%). All 3 patients with IgH rearrangement had associated one or more high-risk genetic aberration and hence were included in high risk group. 31.1% of the patients were high risk and 68.9% were standard risk. The response to induction chemotherapy, incidence of relapse, time to 1 st relapse and total number of relapses are shown in (table;1) and there was no significant difference between high risk and standard risk group. Overall survival in standard risk group at 2 and 5 years was 89.6% \u00b1 5.8% and 78.6% \u00b1 13.9% and in high risk group was 60.7% \u00b1 13.2% and 29.5% \u00b1 23.1% respectively (p value: 0.762). Overall survival was significantly lower in age group \u226566 years as compared to age group \u2264 60 years and 61 - 65 years (p value 0.001) and it was also significantly lower in R ISS stage 3 as compared to R ISS stage 1 and 2 (p value 0.006). Conclusion: More than one third patients of MM (36.1%) showed genetic abnormality, amplification 1q being the most frequent. Overall survival was significantly lower in older age group and R ISS stage 3 patients. Response to induction chemotherapy and relapse rate were similar in high and standard risk groups. Although overall survival was lower in high risk group, it was statistically not significant. This study highlights the importance of FISH analysis for disease stratification and prognostication which should be routinely practiced.
