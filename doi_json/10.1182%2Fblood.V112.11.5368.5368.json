    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Diadenosine 5\u2032,5\u2034-P 1 ,P 4 - tetraphosphate (Ap 4 A) is stored in platelet dense granules, but its effects on platelet function are not well understood. In the current study, we examined the effects of Ap 4 A on signaling through the human platelet purinergic receptors P2Y 1 , P2Y 12 and P2X 1 . Methods: Flow cytometry was used to measure the effects of Ap 4 A in the presence or absence of ADP on: P2Y 12 -mediated decrease in intraplatelet phosphorylated vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), P2Y 1 - mediated increase in platelet cytosolic Ca 2+ (measured with FLUO-4), and c) P2X 1 - mediated intraplatelet entry of extracellular Ca 2+ (measured with FLUO-4) (Figure). ADP-stimulated platelet shape change (P2Y 1 -mediated) and aggregation (P2Y 1 - and P2Y 12 -mediated) were measured optically. Results: Ap 4 A inhibited 3 \u03bcM ADP-induced: platelet aggregation (IC 50 9.8 \u00b1 2.8 \u03bcM, n = 3), P2Y 1 -mediated shape change, P2Y 1 -mediated increase in platelet cytosolic Ca 2+ (IC 50 40.8 \u00b1 12.3 \u03bcM, n = 3), and P2Y 12 -mediated decrease in VASP phosphorylation (IC 50 >250 \u03bcM, n = 3). In addition to inhibiting these ADP-induced effects on P2Y 1 and P2Y 12 , Ap 4 A in the absence of added ADP decreased VASP phosphorylation, albeit with significantly reduced potency compared to ADP. This Ap 4 A-induced reduction of VASP phosphorylation was reversed by addition of AR-C69931, a selective P2Y 12 antagonist. Ap 4 A, therefore, has partial P2Y 12 agonist properties. Ap 4 A also had agonist effects on platelet P2X 1 receptors, as evidenced by intraplatelet entry of extracellular Ca 2+ . All these effects of Ap 4 A were significant at pathophysiologic concentrations. Ap 4 A had no agonist effects on platelet P2Y 1 receptors. Conclusions: Ap 4 A, a known constituent of platelet dense granules, is an antagonist of platelet P2Y 1 and P2Y 12 receptors, where it inhibits the effects of ADP, an agonist of P2X 1 receptors, and a partial agonist of P2Y 12 receptors (Figure).
