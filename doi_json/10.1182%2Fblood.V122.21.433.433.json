    "abstract_text": "The \u03b2-genes undergo developmental activation and silencing in part by competing for their upstream enhancer, the locus control region (LCR). In adult erythroid cells, the LCR contacts the \u03b2-globin gene promoter by forming a loop that precludes interaction with the embryonic and fetal \u03b2-type globin genes. Reversing this developmental gene expression switch in favor of embryonic/fetal genes has therapeutic implications for patients with hemoglobinopathies. Here we employed a forced chromatin looping approach to activate the silenced murine embryonic \u03b2h1-globin gene and the human fetal \u03b3-globin gene in adult erythroid cells. We have previously shown that forced recruitment via artificial zinc finger proteins of Ldb1, a protein necessary for long-range chromatin interactions at the \u03b2-globin locus, can trigger chromatin loop formation and transcription initiation. Here, we designed a zinc finger protein targeting the \u03b2h1 promoter, fused it to the self-association domain of Ldb1 (\u03b2h1-Ldb1), and introduced it into an adult murine erythroid cell line that normally produces nearly 100% adult \u03b2-globin. \u03b2h1-Ldb1 expression activated \u03b2h1-globin transcription up to 3000-fold accounting for \u223c20% of total \u03b2-globin expression. \u03b2h1-Ldb1 similarly increased expression of \u03b2h1-globin in fetal liver derived primary erythroid cells. These results are striking given the degree to which murine embryonic globin genes are normally repressed. To test whether the activity \u03b2h1-Ldb1 was due to a looped interaction of the \u03b2h1 promoter with the LCR, we introduced \u03b2h1-Ldb1 into fetal liver derived erythroblasts from mice in which the LCR had been deleted. \u03b2h1-Ldb1 was virtually inactive in the absence of the LCR, demonstrating the dependence on the LCR and, by inference, long range looping of \u03b2h1-Ldb1 function. We next extended this approach to the human \u03b2-globin locus in an effort to activate expression of the fetal \u03b3-globin gene in adult erythroid cells. Ldb1 was fused to a previously described \u03b3-globin promoter binding zinc finger protein, GG1, to generate GG1-Ldb1. Introduction of GG1-Ldb1 into adult primary human erythroid cells strongly activated \u03b3-globin expression with a concomitant reduction in \u03b2-globin transcription. Strikingly, \u03b3-globin accounted for nearly 90% of total \u03b2-type globin transcription. Furthermore, fetal hemoglobin expression was nearly pan-cellular as determined by flow cytometry. These results demonstrate the power of forced chromatin looping to reprogram developmental regulation of gene expression, and provide a novel proof of concept for activating the \u03b3-globin gene for the benefit of patients with hemoglobinopathies.
