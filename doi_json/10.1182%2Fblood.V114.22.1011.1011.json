    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1011 Poster Board I-33 Background: Addition of purine analogues to standard induction therapy of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) had previously been demonstrated to increase complete remission rate. The aim of this study was to analyze whether the use of cladribine or fludarabine during induction and consolidation increases the risk of infectious complications. Material and methods: 118 AML patients, included in two consecutive randomized trials between 1999-2006 in a single centre were analyzed. Induction therapy consisted of daunorubicin + cytarabine (DA-7, n=53) alone or in combination with cladribine or fludarabine (DAC-7 + DAF-7, n=65 ). Consolidation included one course of high-dose AraC + mitoxantrone and one course of high-dose AraC +/- purine analogues. A median age was 45(17-58) years and 48(20-60) years for patients treated with and without purine analogues, respectively. Results: The frequency of neutropenic fever as well as microbiologically documented bacterial, fungal and viral infections during induction and consolidation did not differ between two compared groups - receiving or not purine analogues. Time to infection occurrence and infection duration were similar in both study groups. During induction and both consolidation treatments significant lower values of lymphocytosis were observed in the group of patients treated with purine analogues. There was a slight tendency to increased rate of mucositis for patients treated with purine analogues (60% vs. 44.3%, p=0.07) during induction treatment, while infections affecting skin and soft tissues were significant frequent for patients treated without purine analogues (43.3% vs. 18%, p=0.03) during second consolidation treatment (high dose AraC). The usage of intravenous anti-infectious medications (antibiotics, antifungal, antiviral) and periods of hospitalization did not differ between two groups in this study. Conclusions: We conclude that the use of purine analogues, either cladribine or fludarabine along with conventional induction and consolidation therapy does not aggreviate infectious complications in adults with AML. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
