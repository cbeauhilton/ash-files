    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4917 T-cell lymphomas (TCL) are a heterogeneous group of aggressive malignancies lacking specific and efficient therapy. Unfortunately, there are neither animal models nor representative cell lines for most TCL types, making functional and pharmacogenomics studies even more difficult. PI3K and PIM are kinases involved in cell proliferation, frequently altered in human cancer that seems to play a critical role in T-cell development and activation. Genomic studies have identified PIK3CD subunit to be significantly associated with in activation of CD40, NF-kB and TCR-pathways. The aim of this project is to determine the efficiency of PI3K inhibitors (PI3Ki) and PIM inhibitors (PIMi) in TCL, looking for biomarkers of their mechanism of action and to identify markers that could identify responders from non-responders. Twenty PTCL and seven reactive lymph nodes were studied using gene expression microarrays. We performed an in silico analysis using the Connectivity Map program to identify drugs that could potentially reverse PTCL gene expression signature. Among them, several PI3K/mTOR inhibitors were found. A panel of 6 TCL cell lines belonging to different TCL subgroups were treated with 3 PI3Ki (LY294002, ETP-45658, GDC-0941) and one PIMi (ETP-39010). Functional studies were also done to establish the role of each of the targeted genes. In vitro studies showed that PI3Ki induced G1 cell cycle arrest in all cell lines, and apoptosis in a portion of them, in a time/dose-dependent manner. We also observed a decrease in the levels of pAKT(S473), pGSK3B(S9) and p-p70S6K(T389) after treatment. In addition, both the analysis of the PTCL gene expression signature as well as western blot studies on TCL cell lines has shown overexpression of PIM family genes, A decrease in cell viability, and a strong induction of apoptosis in all cell lines was seen after PIM inhibition, without cell cycle arrest. Several diagnostic and pharmacodynamic biomarkers of PIMi have been identified at the mRNA and protein level in both cell lines In conclusion, our results indicate that PI3Ki and PIMi are effective therapeutic approaches for TCLs, identifying potential markers for patient's stratification and pharmacodynamic assessment.
