    "abstract_text": "Introduction Risk-stratification of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can not only improve treatment response, but also reduce side effects of the treatment, especially in the elderly. A number of patient-specific and leukemia-associated factors are related to the poor outcome in older patients with AML. However, comprehensive studies regarding the impact of genetic alterations in this group of patients are limited. Methods and Materials A total of 500 adult patients with newly diagnosed de novo AML who had enough bone marrow cryopreserved cells for analysis at the National Taiwan University Hospital were enrolled consecutively. We compared the clinico-biological features, cytogenetics and molecular gene mutations between patients aged 60 years or older (n=185) and those younger (<60 years, n=315). Result Among older patients, those received standard intensive chemotherapy had a longer overall survival (OS) than those treated with palliative care. Compared with younger patients, the elderly had a higher incidence of poor-risk cytogenetic changes, but a lower frequency of favorable-risk cytogenetics. The median number of molecular gene mutations at diagnosis was higher in the elderly than the younger. Older patients had significantly higher incidences of PTPN11, NPM1 , RUNX1 , ASXL1 , TET2 , DNMT3A , and P53 mutations but a lower frequency of WT1 mutations. In multivariate analysis for OS among the elderly who received standard intensive chemotherapy, high WBC >50,000/\u03bcL at diagnosis, RUNX1 mutations, DNMT3A mutations, and P53 mutations were independent worse prognostic factors, while the presence of NPM1 mutations in the abcence of FLT3 /ITD mutations was an independent good prognostic factor. The frequency of acquiring one or more adverse genetic alterations was much higher in older patients than younger ones. Further, the pattern of gene mutations could divide older patients with intermediate cytogenetics into three groups with significantly different complete remission rates, OS, and disease-free survival. Conclusion Older AML patients frequently harbored high-risk cytogenetics and gene mutations, and had poorer prognosis. Integration of cytogenetics and molecular alterations could risk-stratify older patients into groups with significant different outcomes. For those patients with poor prognosis under current chemotherapy, novel therapies, such as demethylating agents or other targeted therapies may be indicated.
