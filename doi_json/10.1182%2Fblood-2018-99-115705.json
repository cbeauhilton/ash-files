    "abstract_text": "Backgroud T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) is a highly aggressive lymphoma with very poor clinical outcomes which has not standard treatment. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of tandem autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) treatment for adult T-LBL and assessed the factors that affect survival. Methods 160 newly diagnosed adult T-LBL patients were divided into three groups: chemotherapy group (68 patients), single auto-HSCT group (46 patients), and tandem auto-HSCT group (46 patients). The primary outcome measure was failure-free survival. The intermediate primary outcomes were progression/relapse rate and overall survival. Factors influencing toxicity related to tandem auto-HSCT treatment and prognosis for the patients were analyzed as well. Results The 3-year progression/relapse rate of the tandem auto-HSCT group was significantly lower than that of the single auto-HSCT group and chemotherapy group (19.6% vs 45.7% and 70.6%, p < 0.05). The 3-year PFS rate and OS rate of the tandem auto-HSCT group (68.3% and 72.5%, respectively) were significantly higher than those of the single auto-HSCT group (41.5% and 55.4%, respectively, p < 0.05) and the chemotherapy group (23.3% and 43.3%, respectively, p < 0.05). In the tandem auto-HSCT group, age and disease status after the first transplant had an influence on the OS and PFS. Multivariate analysis identified disease status after the first transplant as the only independent prognostic factor for outcome in T-LBL. Conclusions Tandem auto-HSCT improves long-term survival of adult T-LBL patients. Disease status after the first transplant was an independent prognostic indicator for those patients.
