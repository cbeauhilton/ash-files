    "abstract_text": "Background: Patients with haematogical diseases and undergoing stem cell or bone marrow transplantation are at high risk for an invasive fungal infection. The appearance and course of this is a significant threat to the overall success of transplantation. The optimal antifungal prophylaxis for stem cell transplanted patients has not yet been clearly etablished. Whereas oral medication seems to be convenient it is often hampered in the course of administration by mucositis or/and unclear absorption. We analysed the impact of antimycotic prophylaxis in our unit. We started with Voriconazol (tbl.) or Itraconazol (solution) followed by an early switch to liposomal amphotericin B with a dose 1 mg/kgBW, if the patients didn\u2019t tolerate oral medications. Patients and methods: 48 patients (18f/30m) with a history of possible (n=4), probable (n=1) or proven (n=3) invasive fungal infection according to EORTC-MSG criteria or no (n=40) fungal infection underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation in our centre between 08/2005 and 05/2006. Mean age was 47 (6\u201367) and underlying disease was acute leukaemia (18 AML, 5 ALL, 3 NHL, 4 MM, 4 CML, 14 other). Transplants were unrelated in 38 and related in10 cases. Results: Prophylaxis started on average 6 days prior to transplant (mean 6, range 0\u201319) with ITZ (n=24), VOR (n=8) or LAMB (n=8). 8 pts. developed early signs of fungal infection precluding analysis within the prophylaxis population. 15/24 pts. on ITZ and 3/8 pts. on VOR needed a switch to i.v.-medication with LAMB. 3/24 pts. starting with ITZ developed a fungal infection (2 possible, 1 probable). Pts. starting with VOR or LAMB required empiric therapy in 1 and 4 cases, respectively. 12 pts. after switching to LAMB required no further antifungal-therapy. Conclusions: In our experience antifungal prophylaxis with oral medication being switched to LAMB in case of mucositis or side effects is an effective and tolerated option to prevent invasive fungal infection in patients during allogeneic stem cell or bone marrow transplantation.",
