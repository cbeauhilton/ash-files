    "abstract_text": "Both G-CSF and GM-CSF (alone or in combination) may be used for mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). It has been suggested that GM-CSF use during mobilization may impact graft composition and therefore clinical outcomes. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated patients \u2264 70 years old with relapsed CD20+ NHL who were candidates for ASCT. Additional eligibility criteria included adequate marrow and organ function. Patients with history of pelvic radiation, > 3 prior chemoregimens or > 6 cycles of fludarabine chemotherapy were excluded. Patients recieved chemotherapy with ifosfamide 3.33 g/m 2 daily \u00d7 3 days, etoposide 150 mg/m 2 \u00d7 6 doses and rituximab (375 mg/m 2 on day 1 and 1 g/m 2 on day 8). Using a Bayesian adaptive randomization based on treatment outcomes, patient\u2019s were randomized to receive G-CSF 12 \u03bcg/kg/d (Group G) or G-CSF 12 \u03bcg/kg/d plus GM-CSF 500 \u03bcg/d (Group G/GM). We assumed that the success rate for each treatment arm had a \u03b2 prior distribution with mean 0.90 and variance 0.03. Cytokines started 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy and continued until completion of apheresis. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were randomized to Group G and 41 patients to Group G/GM. In each arm 1 patient withdrew consent after randomization. Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups (Table 1). Both regimens were equally well tolerated. Data are presented as intent to treat analysis. Thirty-nine patients (90.7%) in Group G and 35 patients (85.4%) in Group G/GM collected \u2265 4 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg. The probability that Group G has a higher success rate than Group G/GM is 0.778. The median CD34+ cell dose collected was 10.3 \u00d7 10 6 /kg (range, 0.1\u201359) and 7.5 \u00d7 10 6 /kg (range, 0.7\u201373) in Groups G and G/GM respectively (P=NS). A median of 2 apheresis procedures were required in both arms. Seventy-three patients have undergone ASCT. After a median follow up time of 14.5 months (range, 0.6\u201338.5) in Group G and 14.0 months (range, 1.1\u201339.9) in Group G/GM, the 3 year PFS is 75% (95% CI 57.9\u201399.4) and 77% (95% CI 65\u201391.5) respectively (P=0.41). CONCLUSION: Our study does not support the hypothesis that using G-CSF plus GM-CSF versus G-CSF alone for progenitor cell mobilization alters graft composition in a way that impacts clinical outcomes after ASCT for NHLs.
