    "abstract_text": "Bone marrow (BM) macrophages maintain both survival and retention of hematopoietic stem cells and regulate erythropoiesis. The role of macrophage lectins and glycans in thrombopoiesis remains unclear. We report a novel role for bone marrow macrophage galectin-3 in maintaining platelet counts, by phagocytosing megakaryocytes (MKs) expressing the Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF) antigen, which is often exposed under pathological conditions, such as cancer and malignancies. The TF antigen is a disaccharide presented in cryptic form on O-glycans and covered by a sialic acid moiety. The sialyltransferase ST3Gal1 transfers sialic acid onto the TF antigen. To investigate the role of O-glycans in thrombopoiesis, we generated mice with increased TF antigen in MKs by generating St3gal1 loxP/PF4+ mice specifically lacking ST3Gal1 in the MK lineage. As expected, St3gal1 loxP/PF4+ circulating platelets and BM MKs had increased TF antigen expression, compared to controls, as evidenced by peanut agglutinin (PNA) binding. Other blood cell lineages had no increase in TF antigen expression. St3gal1 loxP/PF4+ mice developed mild thrombocytopenia, but surprisingly had virtually normal platelet clearance. BM MK colony forming units and in vitro proplatelet production were normal in St3gal1 loxP/PF4+ mice, suggesting that extrinsic factors in the St3gal1 loxP/PF4+ BM environment affected platelet production. St3gal1 loxP/PF4+ BM smears revealed increased hemophagocytosis, indicative of an increase in phagocytic macrophages. In vivo macrophage ablation by injection of clodronate-encapsulated liposomes significantly reduced the numbers of activated macrophages, thereby normalizing blood platelet counts and size. Flow cytometric phenotypic analysis of BM-derived macrophages showed an increased population of activated macrophages in St3gal1 loxP/PF4+ mice, compared to controls, specifically macrophages with increased galectin-3 expression, a ligand for the TF antigen. Immunofluorescence staining of BM sections using a specific antibody towards the TF antigen showed that MK progenitors and pro-platelet-like structures expressed TF antigen in control BMs, which is significantly increased in St3gal1 loxP/PF4+ mice and co-localized with galectin-3 expressing macrophages, supporting the notion that MK O-glycans and macrophage galectin-3 play a role in thrombopoiesis under steady state and pathological conditions. Consistent with this notion, galectin-3 deficient mice have slightly, but significantly increased blood platelet counts. We conclude that galactin-3 plays a minor role in normal thrombopoiesis. Activation of galectin-3 expressing macrophages by the MK TF antigen leads to MK phagocytosis, inhibition of platelet formation and thrombocytopenia.
