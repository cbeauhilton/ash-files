The aim of this poster is to examine real world healthcare resource utilization assessments in patients treated with rasburicase for the prevention or management of tumor lysis hyperuricemia. METHODS: Four separate oncology E.H.R. database recent publications were selected for assessment of the prevention and treatment of hyperuricemia associated with TLS. The separate databases include data from 400 hospitals across 42 states, 14,383 newly-diagnosed lymphoma patients across 101 hospitals in a non-profit community oncology network, 21 healthcare organizations accounting for a total of 26 million patients, and 750,000 community oncology patients that includes 25,000 active OCM practices. The separate studies queried databases for patients at high risk of hyperuricemia of TLS inclusive of tumor diagnosis, uric acid, LDH, WBC, uricosuric agent, site of care, and health resource utilization such as hospitalization and length of stay. RESULTS: See Table CONCLUSIONS: Across the findings from 4 separate retrospective, real-world studies assessing the prevention and management of hyperuricemia of TLS, the application of criteria for the identification of patients at intermediate or high risk are not universally applied. Recognition of clinical risk factors for hyperuricemia of TLS are needed for the timely and appropriate selection of therapy to prevent hyperuricemia of chemotherapy.
