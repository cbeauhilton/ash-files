    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5153 Introduction: Iron deficiency suppresses hemoglobin synthesis and erythropoiesis, but the resulting anemia is frequently associated with thrombocytosis. Methods: The clinical and hematologic data of seven women with severe iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and thrombocytopenia were retrospectively analyzed. Results: All patients were African-American women with symptomatic IDA, due to bleeding from uterine fibroids in 6 and from colonic diverticulosis in 1. They were 31\u201370 years of age, median 38. None had palpable splenomegaly. Hemoglobin ranged from 2.9\u20135.5, median 4.2 g/dL. MCV ranged from 57\u201370 fl, median 68. Absolute reticulocyte counts ranged from 19,000 \u2013 23, 000/mm 3 . The initial serum ferritin ranged from 2 to 42 ng/ml, median 4. Serum iron levels ranged from 10 to 70 mcg/dl with median 30, while iron-binding capacities ranged from 381\u2013426 mcg/dl. Serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels were >2000U/ml in two of the patients. Serum lactic dehydrogenase, bilirubin levels and liver function tests were normal; and Coombs' test negative in all cases. White blood cell counts were normal. The platelet counts ranged from 12 to 103, with a median of 46 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Peripheral blood smears showed microcytic hypochromic red blood cells (RBC), with no evidence of platelet clumping. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy on two patients showed increased numbers of normal megakaryocytes, erythroid hyperplasia and absent iron stores. Six patients were treated with packed RBC transfusions, and ferrous sulphate 325 mg orally was initiated at presentation in 7. Their thrombocytopenia was not treated with steroids or other agents. Three patients' platelet count reached normal or super-normal levels within 72 hours. Six patients were seen at \u22653 months after presentation, and all had achieved normal platelet counts and hemoglobin. Conclusions: These data imply that severe IDA can sometimes cause thrombocytopenia rather than thromobocytosis. We cannot be sure whether these patients' uniform normalization of platelet counts was due to treatment of their anemia by transfusion, or iron therapy. Though bone marrow megakaryocyte numbers were increased in 2 patients, there is no evidence for peripheral platelet destruction. Platelet release from megakaryocytes may have decreased in these patients. Pharmacologic EPO therapy can occasionally cause thrombocytopenia, and high endogenous EPO levels in our patients may have reduce their platelet counts. This conclusion is consistent with their apparent response to transfusion. Though the pathogenesis of IDA-associated thrombocytopenia is not known, our data suggest that the results of anemia and iron deficiency treatment should be evaluated before investigating thrombocytopenia as an independent problem.
