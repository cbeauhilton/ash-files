    "abstract_text": "Background: Myeloid leukemia in Down syndrome (ML-DS) is associated with good response to chemotherapy thus results in a favorable outcome. However, relapsed and refractory cases are rarely salvageable, regardless of receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Several factors such as certain chromosomal abnormalities and age at diagnosis are somewhat prognostic, but no universal prognostic factor has been found to date. In order to identify a subgroup with high risk of treatment failure, the role of minimal residual disease (MRD) with three methods were explored in the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (JPLSG) trial AML-D11. Procedure: AML-D11 is a nationwide single-arm clinical trial for children (4 months to 17 years old) with ML-DS. All patients received an identical chemotherapy to the previous AML-D05 study (Taga T. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2016). MRD was evaluated at two time points, one after the induction therapy and another at the end of whole chemotherapy, using 3 different methods; flow cytometric MRD (FCM-MRD), deep sequencing MRD of mutant GATA1 (GATA1-MRD) and PCR MRD of WT1 mRNA expression (WT1-MRD). WT1-MRD was measured in both bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples, while FCM- and GATA1-MRD were measured only in BM samples. Results: A total of 78 patients were eligible and followed-up with a median of 47.6 months (range, 8 to 68.8 months). Seventy-six patients were stratified to the standard risk (SR) and one patient to the high risk (HR) group by morphological response. One patient died of sepsis during initial induction therapy. Three-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 87.2% (95%CI, 77.5 to 92.9%) and 89.7% (95%CI, 80.5 to 94.7%), respectively. FCM-MRD and GATA1-MRD after initial induction therapy were positive in 5/65 and 7/59 patients, respectively, which were both significantly prognostic (Fig.1). Prognostic significance of WT1-MRD could not be evaluated due to a limited number of collected samples. Conclusions: MRD detections by FCM and targeted deep sequencing of GATA1 after initial induction therapy are both significant prognostic factors for predicting relapse. Risk stratification using FCM-MRD is currently incorporated in the on-going Japan Children's Cancer Group ML-DS trial (AML-D16; jrct.niph.go.jp, jRCTs041190047).
