    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic HSCT is a curative therapy for leukemia and other hematologic malignancies and disorders. Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (aGvHD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality that limits the success of HSCT. No large analysis of this complication has been recently performed. Risk factors for aGvHD after HLA-matched sibling myeloablative unmanipulated HSCT were analyzed in 1960 adult (\u226518 yrs) patients treated for AML (n=761), ALL (n=303), or CML (n=896) and reported to the CIBMTR registry from 1995\u20132002 by 226 centers worldwide. All patients received cyclosporine+methotrexate (CSA+MTX) alone (85%) or CSA+MTX+other agents (15%) for aGvHD prophylaxis. 635 (32%) patients developed grade II-IV aGvHD before day +100 post\u2013HSCT. Outcome was measured as time from HSCT to onset of aGvHD Grade II-IV with death as a competing risk. Statistically significant risk factors for aGvHD in the univariate analysis were: Age \u2265 40 vs < 40 at HSCT, RR (95% CI, P) =1.35 (1.16\u20131.58, P=0.0001); Race, White/Black vs. Asian/Hispanic, RR=1.65 (1.31\u20132.08, P 80, RR=1.34 (1.12\u20131.60, P=0.0016); and Donor ever Pregnant, Yes vs No/Male, RR=1.21 (1.10\u20131.43, P=0.034). Other factors not significant in the univariate analysis were year of HSCT (1995\u20131998 vs. 1999\u20132002), recipient/donor sex-matching, time from diagnosis to HSCT, recipient/donor CMV status, donor gender, ABO compatibility, and planned G-CSF use post-HSCT. Multivariate analysis of time to onset of aGvHD Grade II-IV was performed by using a Cox proportional hazards model with backwards step-wise selection and P > 0.05 to remove each clinical factor from the model. Significant independent predictors of aGvHD Grade II-IV risk were: Conditioning Regimen, CyTBI vs BuCy, RR (95% CI, P) RR=1.4, (1.2\u20131.7, P 80, RR=1.3 (1.05\u20131.5, P=0.014) and recipient/donor CMV status, at least one + vs \u2212/ \u2212, RR=0.8 (0.7\u20130.99, P=0.04). For pts \u2265 40 yrs at BMT, PB was not an independent risk factor for aGvHD Grade II-IV. There are modifiable risk factors for aGvHD Grade II-IV which include conditioning regimen, stem cell source (in younger patients) and CMV negative donors for CMV negative recipients. There are non-modifiable risk factors such as recipient age, race and gender and underlying diagnosis. Identifying patients at high risk for aGvHD Grade II-IV may allow for individualized risk modification and result in altering treatment strategies.",
