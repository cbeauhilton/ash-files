    "abstract_text": "Selected monoclonal antibodies to murine CD44 are able to successfully ameliorate murine immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and other inflammatory diseases at a 3 log fold lower dose than IVIg. Since not all murine CD44 antibodies were successful and, like IVIg, the anti-inflammatory mechanism involved is speculative, progress toward human antibodies has been stymied. To potentially develop a therapeutic antibody for patients, we generated transgenic mice expressing the extracellular and transmembrane sequences of human CD44 linked to the murine intracellular CD44 sequence (huCD44) with knockout of murine CD44. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that these mice express huCD44 on leukocytes, but not on platelets or red blood cells. HuCD44 mice injected with the anti-platelet antibody MWReg30 develop significant thrombocytopenia comparable to normal mice. Utilizing the huCD44 mouse model, we tested 5 monoclonal antibodies reactive with human CD44 of different isotypes; mouse IgG 1 , mouse IgG 2a , mouse IgG 2b , rat IgG 2a , and rat IgG 2b . We report here that pretreatment of mice with all of these antibodies, with the exception of the mouse IgG 2b clone all ameliorated thrombocytopenia to the same extent as IVIg, but given at a 3 log-fold lower dosage than IVIg. Interestingly, the mouse IgG 2b antibody that was not successful bound to white blood cells as well as the successful antibodies. When mice were re-injected with anti-platelet antibody 24 hr post anti-huCD44 antibody injection, they were still protected from thrombocytopenia at 48 hr, suggesting that these antibodies exhibit durable protection. The clinical effectiveness of these antibodies does not appear to be related to their extent of huCD44 binding or IgG subtype. In addition, the effectiveness of these antibodies may not be restricted or related to specific activating IgG Fc receptors (Fc\u03b3R) as the successful mouse IgG 1 subtype is only known to interact with Fc\u03b3RIII, while the IgG 2b subtype can bind activating Fc\u03b3RI, III and IV with only one-of-two of this subtype having therapeutic activity. In conclusion we have developed, to our knowledge, the first huCD44 transgenic mouse and demonstrate herein that selected antibodies to huCD44 can ameliorate immune thrombocytopenia. These data suggest that some anti-CD44 antibodies may offer a new therapeutic modality for patients with ITP. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
