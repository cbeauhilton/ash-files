    "abstract_text": "Introduction eIF5A is the only known protein to be modified by hypusination and is highly conserved across species. Hypusinated eIF5A, the predominant form in normal and cancer cells, is involved in cell survival and inflammatory pathway activation. siRNAs targeting eIF5A inhibit NF-kB activation and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Accumulation of the unhypusinated lysine form of eIF5A is associated with apoptosis. Mutants of eIF5A that cannot be hypusinated (e.g. eIF5A K50R ) are pro-apoptotic in vitro and have anti-tumoral activity in vivo in multiple cancer types including melanoma and lung cancer. SNS01-T is a novel therapeutic with a dual mechanism of eIF5A modulation: inducing cell death via siRNA-mediated inhibition of hypusinated eIF5A while simultaneously causing over-expression of pro-apoptotic eIF5A K50R via a DNA plasmid with a B-cell promoter to induce tumor cell death. SNS01-T significantly inhibited tumor growth and increased survival in mouse models of myeloma (MM), mantle cell and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The phase 1-2 study of SNS01-T has completed 4 planned dosing cohorts 0.0125, 0.05, 0.2 and 0.375 mg/kg twice weekly IV for 6 weeks in pts with refractory B-cell cancers. Methods PK and PD secondary endpoints included characterization of PK by measuring pExp5A plasmid DNA and eIF5A siRNA in blood and bone marrow (BM), assessing potential immunogenicity of SNS01-T by measuring serum concentrations of antibodies against SNS01-T nanoparticles, and measuring serum concentrations of select proinflammatory cytokines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum and plasma samples. Blood PK timepoints were 30 minutes before the first infusion and at 30 minutes, 2, 6, and 24 hours after the first infusions on Week 1, Week 3, and Week 6 and at the 4, 8, and 12 week visits after the last infusion; BM samples were collected 1 day after the final infusion. Serum and plasma PD sampling timepoints were 30 minutes before and at 2, 6, and 24 hours after the first infusion on Week 1, Week 3, and Week 6, and at 4 weeks after the final infusion. Cytokines assayed included TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u00df, IFN-g, CXCL1, IL-1\u00df, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12. Results Table 1 shows data available for interpretation as of August 2014. The remaining samples are under analysis and will be presented. Abstract 2121. Table 1: Data available for interpretation (number of patients)   SNS01-T Dose  Overall (n=18)  0.0125 mg/kg (n=6)  0.05 mg/kg (n=4)  0.2 mg/kg (n=4)  0.375 mg/kg (n=4)  Blood PK DNA and RNA 15 6 4 4 1 Bone marrow PK 8 2 3 2 1 Serum antibodies to SNS01-T nanoparticles 18 6 4 4 4 Serum and plasma cytokines 15 6 4 4 1  SNS01-T Dose  Overall (n=18)  0.0125 mg/kg (n=6)  0.05 mg/kg (n=4)  0.2 mg/kg (n=4)  0.375 mg/kg (n=4)  Blood PK DNA and RNA 15 6 4 4 1 Bone marrow PK 8 2 3 2 1 Serum antibodies to SNS01-T nanoparticles 18 6 4 4 4 Serum and plasma cytokines 15 6 4 4 1 View Large Plasmid and siRNA blood levels generally peaked 30 minutes post-dosing at weeks 1, 3 and 6 of dosing. Both plasmid and siRNA exhibited rapid clearance from the blood, with levels dropping to near pre-dosing levels within 24 hours of administration. pExp5A plasmid DNA was detectable in the bone marrow of 2 pts at cohort 1, 2 at cohort 2, 1 at cohort 3 and 1 at cohort 4. eIF5A siRNA was not detectable in bone marrow. No antibodies to SNS01-T nanoparticles were detected at any timepoint at any dose level. Cytokines remained within the expected range of inter-patient variability, similar to baseline across all timepoints at the first 2 dose levels. At dose level 3, levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 in particular increased at the 2 and 6 hour timepoints but had recovered to baseline levels 24-hours post dosing. This effect was more pronounced at the first infusion. Conclusions PCR analysis demonstrated the presence of both plasmid DNA and siRNA components of SNS01-T in blood at all dose levels, with a dose-dependent increase in plasmid copy number. Plasmid DNA was also detected in bone marrow collected 24 hours after the final infusion of SNS01-T. Pro-inflammatory cytokines did increase within hours of infusion but returned to baseline within 24 hours, synchronous with the clinical infusion reactions (see Abstract 70148). No evidence of an anti-SNS01-T antibody response was observed in any subject. Phase 2 trials are planned. Disclosures Bexon: Senesco: Consultancy. Craig: Senesco: PI Other. Siegel: Senesco: PI Other.
