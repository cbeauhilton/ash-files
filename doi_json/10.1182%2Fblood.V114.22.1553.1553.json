    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1553 Poster Board I-576 We evaluated survival for all patients diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in Sweden 1973-2005 (n=6,136; 3,515 men and 2,621 women; median age 40 years). Patients were categorized into six age groups and four calendar periods (1973-1980, 1981-1988, 1989-1996, and 1997-2005). Relative survival ratios (RSRs) were computed as measures of patient survival. Cumulative relative survival improved over time in all age groups with the greatest improvement in patients 51-65 years. Also in patients 66-80 years, significant improvements were recorded in both five- and ten year RSRs. Importantly, a plateau in relative survival was observed after 5 years in patients below \u2264 35 years of age during the last calendar period suggesting a lack of long-term treatment-related mortality. The ten-year RSRs in this calendar period were 0.95, 0.95, 0.92, 0.80, and 0.51 for the age groups 0-18, 19-35, 36-50, 51-65, and 66-80, respectively. Thus, despite this progress, age at diagnosis remains an important predictor of outcome. We also found a significantly better survival for women when adjusted for age and calendar period. During the study period, refined treatment options for patients with limited and advanced-stage HL have contributed to an increasing cure rate. In addition, our findings support that long-term mortality of HL therapy has decreased. Elderly patients still do poorly and targeted treatment options associated with fewer side effects will advance the clinical HL field.
