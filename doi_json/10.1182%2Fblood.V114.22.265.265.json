    "abstract_text": "Abstract 265 In Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL), the Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells are a minority of large mono- or multi-nucleated B cells characterized by a loss of B cell phenotype, constitutive NF-kB activation, a disturbed cell cycle and anti-apoptotic features. In this study we investigated the role of deregulated miRNA expression in the pathogenesis of HL. MiRNA in situ hybridization (ISH) in HL tissue was performed to determine expression of miRNAs previously reported to be highly abundant in HL cell lines, in HRS cells. Next we identified the miRNA-targetome of two HL cell lines by immunoprecipitation of RISC in untransfected and transfected cell lines. miRNA ISH confirmed expression of miR-17-5p, miR-24, miR-106a, miR-146a, miR-150, miR-155, miR-181b and miR-210 in HRS cells. Ago2-immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis of the co-immunoprecipitated mRNA revealed that the miRNA-targetome of HL comprises of about 2,500 genes. Inhibition of the anti-miR-17 seed family revealed that about 500 of these genes are regulated by miRNAs of the miR-17 seed family. Gene ontology (GO) analysis for the total miRNA-targetome of HL showed a significant enrichment of genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, immune system development and NF-kB cascade. The miRNA-targetome of HL contained several genes known to be mutated in HRS cells, including A20, FAS, NFKB1A, NFKB1E, PERP and SOCS1 . Also, using previously reported gene expression data, we defined a set of genes downregulated in HL cell lines (L428 and L1236) compared to germinal center B cells (GCB) and compared them to the miRNA-targetome of the same cell lines. This resulted in the identification of 149 genes in L428 and 183 genes in L1236 that were subjected to miRNA mediated repression. Unexpectedly, only a few of all the reported inactivated genes in HRS cells that might contribute to loss of B cell phenotype ( MYBL1 and CXCR4 ) were found to be regulated by miRNAs in HL. In conclusion, we confirmed the expression of miRNAs in the HRS cells of HL tissue and identified miRNA repressed genes in HL. Our data indicated that aberrant miRNA expression contributes to the deregulation of apoptosis, cell cycle, and NF-kB pathways but not loss of B cell phenotype in HL.
