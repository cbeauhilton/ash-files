    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1527 Interim Positron-Emission Tomography (PET-scan), as a functional imaging test for tumor activity, has been shown to be a predictor for progression-free survival (PFS) and time to progression (TTP) in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte/monocyte ratio (ALC/AMC) at diagnosis, as a surrogate marker of host immunity (i.e., ALC) and tumor microenvironment (i.e., AMC), has been recently reported [Porrata et al, Hematologica 2012; 97(2): 262\u20139] and confirmed [Koh et al, Oncologist 2012; 17(6): 871\u201380] to be also a predictor for PFS and TTP in classical HL. Therefore, we evaluated the combination of ALC/AMC ratio at diagnosis and the interim PET-scan to further stratify the clinical outcomes of PFS and TTP in patients with classical HL. To participate in the studies, patients were required to be diagnosed, treated, and followed at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. The treatment consisted of adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) with or without radiation therapy. Patients were required to have an interim PET-scan performed. An ALC/AMC ratio \u22651.1 cut-off was used in the study based on our previous publication [Porrata et al, Hematologica 2012; 97(2): 262\u20139]. From 2000 until 2008, 111 classical HL patients qualified for the study. The cohort included 54% males and 46% females. The median age at diagnosis was 37 years (range: 18\u201383 years). The median follow-up was 2.8 years (range: 0.3\u201310.4 years). Patients with a negative interim PET-scan (N=98) presented with a higher ALC/AMC ratio at diagnosis (median of 2.32, range: 0.26\u201337.5) compared with patients with a positive interim PET-scan (N = 13) (median of 0.9, range: 0.29\u20133.10), p < 0.004. By univariate analysis, the ALC/AMC ratio at diagnosis and the interim PET-scan were predictors for PFS [ ALC/AMC ratio, R =0.13, 95% CI (0.05\u20130.35), p < 0.0002; and interim PET-scan, HR = 0.13, 95% CI (0.05\u20130.37), p < 0.0003] and TTP [ALC/AMC ratio, R =0.07, 95% CI (0.02\u20130.24), p < 0.0001; and interim PET-scan, HR = 0.05, 95% CI (0.01\u20130.18), p < 0.0003]. By multivariate analysis, ALC/AMC ratio at diagnosis and the interim PET-scan were independent predictors for PFS [ ALC/AMC ratio, R =0.13, 95% CI (0.07\u20130.63), p < 0.006; and interim PET-scan, HR = 0.11, 95%CI (0.02\u20130.47), p < 0.003] and TTP [ALC/AMC ratio, R =0.11, 95% CI (0.02\u20130.71), p < 0.02; and interim PET-scan, HR = 0.10, 95% CI (0.02\u20130.46), p < 0.003] when compared to the International Prognostic Score, limited versus advanced stage, and radiation. Patients were stratified into four groups: group 1 included patients with a negative interim PET-scan and ALC/AMC ratio at diagnosis \u22651.1 (N = 88); group 2 included positive interim PET-scan and ALC/AMC ratio at diagnosis \u22651.1 (N = 5); group 3 included negative PET-scan and ALC/AMC ratio at diagnosis < 1.1 (N = 10); and group 4 included positive PET-scan and ALC/AMC ratio at diagnosis <1.1 (N = 8). The three year PFS rates for each group were for goup1 95% (Events = 6); group 2 40% (Events = 3); group 3 56% (Events = 4); and group 4 50% (events = 4), p < 0.0001. The three year TTP rates for each group were: for group1 was 100% (Events = 0); for group 2 of 40% (Events = 3); for group 3 of 65% (Events = 3); and group 4 of 50% (events = 4), p < 0.0001. In conclusion, the ALC/AMC ratio at diagnosis is independent of the interim PET-scan to predict PFS and TTP in classical HL. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings and to assess if the combination of the ALC/AMC ratio at diagnosis and interim PET can be use for planning of risk-adapted treatment.
