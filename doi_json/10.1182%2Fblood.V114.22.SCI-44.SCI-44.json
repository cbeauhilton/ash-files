    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-44 The genetic factors responsible for the highly variable clinical course of inherited bleeding disorders including von Willebrand disease and hemophilia are largely unknown. Similar factors are also likely to contribute to the variability of common thrombotic disorders, including factor V Leiden. Studies by our lab over the past 10 years have used the power of mouse genetics to identify genes contributing to this variability (referred to as \u2018modifier\u2018 genes). By performing genetic crosses between inbred strains of mice with elevated plasma levels of von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and other strains with low levels, we have mapped a total of 6 genetic factors contributing to the control of murine plasma VWF levels. Similar studies in ADAMTS13-deficient mice are in progress aimed at characterizing genes modifying susceptibility thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. We have also conducted large scale mutagenesis studies in the mouse in an effort to identify larger numbers of genes contributing to thrombosis risk in the setting of Factor V Leiden, and most recently are extending this approach to similar genetic screens in zebrafish. Finally, recent advances in human genetics are expanding the potential opportunities for directly identifying bleeding and thrombosis modifier genes in humans.
