    "abstract_text": "The usage of human recombinant erythropoietin (rhEPO) in \u03b2thalassemia shows in many sudies, that not only it increases the synthesis of \u03b3 chains, but it also improves erythroid parameters. Among our population of thalassemic patients, eight patients with \u03b2thalassemia intermedia that were regulary transfused, were given escalating doses of rhEPO mostly darpoietin-\u03b1. Before receiving rhEPO, all patients had undergone splenectomy, also received iron chelation therapy, and folic acid supplementation. No patient received iron supplementation together with rhEPO. With rhEPO, two patients were able to discontinue their requirements for transfusions. In the others, haemoglobin level was maintained above 8 g/dl. Four patients experienced bone pain which was successfully treated with hydroxyurea. All patients had improvement in their quality of life. This small series illustrates that rhEPO may be useful and cost effective in the long term (considering the risks of red blood cell transfusion) in some selected splenectomized transfusion-dependent patients with \u03b2thalassemia intermedia.
