    "abstract_text": "The alkylator Busulfan (Bu) is used in conditioning regimens for acute leukemia prior to allogeneic stem cell transplant. Multiple DNA repair mechanisms including mismatch repair and base excision repair have been implicated in resistance to Bu. The enzyme PARP is central to base excision repair. We hypothesized that treatment of acute leukemia cell lines with both ABT888 (Veliparib), an inhibitor of PARP 1 and 2, and Bu would lead to synergistic cell kill and that this effect is maximal in mismatch repair deficient cells. Two mismatch repair proficient cell lines (K562 and HL60) and 2 mismatch repair deficient cell lines (NB4 and REH) were treated with ABT888 alone, Bu alone or a combination of both. In single drug experiments, doses of drug treatment ranged from 0-400mcg/ml. In combination experiments a fixed dose of ABT888 of 1.25mcg/ml was utilized with Bu doses varying from 0-200mcg/ml. This dose of ABT888 was chosen as it approximated to patient blood levels in clinical trials. After 24 hours of treatment, cells were washed and resuspended in fresh medium. Proliferation of cells was measured by standard 3H-thymidine uptake assay at 48 hours. Sigmoidal dose response curves and GI50 values were then calculated. In addition, cells were tested for apoptosis by flow cytometry using activated caspase 3 and annexin/ PI staining at 24 and 48 hours after treatment. All 4 cell lines were found to be resistant to single agent ABT888. Despite mismatch repair deficiency in REH cells, therapeutic doses of ABT888 did not cause significant decreases in proliferation. The effect of ABT888 was, as expected, much less evident in the mismatch repair proficient K562 cells. These cells were also relatively resistant to single agent Bu in vitro. The combination of Bu and ABT888 was synergistic in all cell lines with GI50 (micromoles/ml) for Bu decreasing from 67.8 to 45.7 in K562, from 23.3 to 8.0 in HL60, from 46.6 to 36.1 in NB4 and from 34.4 to 17.0 in REH cells. The Combination Index was <1 in all cell lines indicating synergy. Dose Reduction Index, indicating the factor by which the dose of Bu can be decreased to achieve the same treatment effect size, ranged from 1.45 to 3.1. The synergistic effect was greatest in the mismatch repair deficient cell line REH (Combination Index 0.53, Dose Reduction Index 3.1). As expected, the synergistic effect observed did not correlate with increased apoptotic death of leukemic cells implying an alternative mechanism for the derease in proliferation. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show synergy of a clinically available PARP inhibitor with Bu. We believe this data warrants further study with the potential clinical application of increasing the antileukemic effect of stem cell transplantation conditioned with Bu containing preparative regimens.
