    "abstract_text": "Background : TGR-1202 is a novel oral, next generation PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor which notably lacks the hepatotoxicity associated with other PI3K\u03b4 inhibitors. Preliminary data from an ongoing Ph I study of TGR-1202 demonstrated clinical activity in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies (ASCO 2014). Herein we present updated results from this Phase I, first in human study of TGR-1202 in patients with relapsed and/or refractory CLL and B-cell lymphoma. Methods : TGR-1202 is administered orally once daily following a 3+3 dose escalation design. Previously treated patients with an ECOG PS \u2264 2 and confirmed diagnosis of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), or other lymphoproliferative disorders are eligible. Endpoints include safety, PK/PD, and efficacy. Results : 49 patients have been enrolled to date of various lymphoma subtypes including CLL, follicular lymphoma (FL), Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (HL), DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). Demographics: 76% male, ECOG 0/1/2: 17/31/1, median age of 59 yrs (range: 22-85), median prior treatment regimens: 3 (range: 1-14), and 43% were refractory to prior treatment. 35 patients have been treated at doses \u2265 800 mg of a previous formulation where a threshold effect in activity was observed, and 6 have been treated with an improved micronized formulation (\u2265 200 mg). TGR-1202 was well tolerated and no MTD has been reached to date. The only Gr\u22653 AE occurring in >5% of patients was neutropenia (8%). AE\u2019s of all grades occurring in >20% of patients were limited to diarrhea (24%), cough (22%), fatigue (20%), and nausea (20%). Notably, in comparison to other PI3K\u03b4 inhibitors, no hepatotoxicity and no cases of colitis have been observed to date. Rates of infection and pneumonia have also been low (12% and 6%, respectively), and no cases of febrile neutropenia have been reported. Of the 41 patients treated at \u2265 800 mg of the previous formulation or with the micronized formulation, 32 are evaluable for efficacy (6 too early to evaluate, 2 non-compliant, 1 did not meet I/E criteria). Responses have been limited in patients with aggressive lymphoma and HL. Of the 9 evaluable CLL patients, 8 (89%) achieved a nodal PR (median nodal reduction of 71%), of which 5 achieved a PR per Hallek 2008 criteria with the remaining 4 having persistent lymphocytosis. The 1 CLL patient with SD had a >40% nodal reduction and remains on study. Of the 7 evaluable FL patients, all have shown clinical benefit with a reduction in tumor burden with 2 having achieved a PR, and the remaining 5 patients in SD. Additionally 2 MZL patients each achieved SD with >25% nodal reductions and remain on study. Notably, no patient with CLL or indolent lymphoma (FL & MZL) treated at \u2265800 mg has progressed to date (median time on study of 20 weeks, range 6 \u2013 73+), and no patient who achieved >50% reduction in tumor burden (including patients with CLL, FL, and HL) has progressed, with median time on study of 34 weeks (range 7 \u2013 68+). Pharmacodynamic analysis in CLL patients indicates rapid suppression of pAKT at doses of 400 mg QD of the previous formulation. Conclusions : TGR-1202 is well tolerated in patients with relapsed and/or refractory hematologic malignancies with no reported hepatotoxicity or events of colitis and promising clinical activity. Enrollment continues in expansion cohorts and with the micronized formulation. Disclosures Brander: Celgene: Mentor received research funding Other.
