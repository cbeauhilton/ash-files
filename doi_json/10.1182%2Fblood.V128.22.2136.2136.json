    "abstract_text": "Cardiac stage and depth of hematologic remission are major predictors of survival for AL amyloidosis patients (Wechalekar et al., Blood, 2013; Dispenzieri et al., JCO, 2004; Palladini et al., JCO, 2012). Renal staging in AL amyloidosis (AL) has been studied in the context of renal survival (Palladini et al., Blood 2014). Influences on survival for renal patients have yet to be fully defined. We performed a retrospective study of all AL patients with renal involvement diagnosed at our center between 7/1/08 and 6/30/15. In this cohort of consecutive patients (n=80) median age was 63 (IQR 55-70) and 56% were men. Eighty-eight percent had lambda plasma cell disease and median involved FLC was 140mg/L (69-485). Thirty-nine percent were renal stage 1, 44% stage 2, and 16% stage 3. Median 24-hour proteinuria and serum creatinine were 6.23 g (3.47-10.70) and 1.03 mg/dL (0.80-1.80) respectively, and median eGFR was 72 mL/min (41-90). Fifty-eight percent had cardiac involvement, of whom 11% were cardiac stage 1, 54% stage 2, and 34% stage 3, while 18% had GI and 9% peripheral nerve involvement. As first-line therapy, 70% received bortezomib-based regimens and 25% melphalan-based autologous stem cell transplant. By intention-to-treat, at 6 months after beginning therapy, 54% of patients had a hematologic response of PR or better, and renal and cardiac responses occurred in 13% and 14% of patients respectively, while renal progression occurred in 6%. Median overall survival (OS) for this cohort (n=80) was 67 months. Those with cardiac involvement (n=45) had a median OS of 41 months and, while median OS was not reached for cardiac stage \u2264 2, it was 31 months for those who were stage 3 ( P <0.05) (Figure). Median OS was also not reached for patients achieving hematologic response \u2265 VGPR with a median follow-up of 19 months. In conclusion, for AL patients with renal involvement, both cardiac stage and depth of hematologic response are important contributors to overall survival. Furthermore, as this real world intention-to-treat analysis demonstrates, there is a continuing need for better therapies for both the hematologic disease and the organ damage associated with AL.
