    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3579 Children with Down syndrome (DS) have an increased risk of developing B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), characterized by a low frequency of the common genetic aberrations, and a high frequency of CRLF2 and JAK aberrations. Because this disease is relatively rare, the clinical outcome, treatment-related mortality (TRM) and prognostic factors of DS-ALL patients treated in contemporary protocols are uncertain. Previous studies demonstrated poorer survival and a high rate of treatment related mortality (TRM), but most studies are small since DS ALL patients comprise only 1\u20132% of all protocol patients. We therefore conducted a large retrospective study of 653 children with DS-ALL treated in clinical trials of 16 collaborative study groups between 1995 and 2005. All genotypes obtained from conventional karyotyping, FISH or RT-PCR were centrally reviewed and assigned to specific cytogenetic groups. The 310 girls and 343 boys have a median age of 5.0 years (range, 1.2 \u2013 17.9) and a median white blood-cell count (WBC) of 10.2 \u00d7 10 9 /L (range, 0.2 \u2013 459). The 827 non-DS BCP-ALL control patients from the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group treated in the same era had similar WBC (8.8 \u00d7 10 9 /L; p=0.25) but were younger (4.6 years; p< 0.001). The median follow-up time was 6.8 years for DS-ALL survivors and 7.3 years for non-DS-ALL survivors. DS patients have a higher 8-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) (26\u00b12% vs. 18\u00b11%; p=0.001) and higher 2-year TRM (7\u00b11% vs. 1.0\u00b1<0.1%; p<0.0001) than controls, resulting in lower 8-year event free survival (EFS) (64\u00b12% vs. 78\u00b11%; p<0.0001) and lower 8-year overall survival (OS) (74\u00b12% vs. 86\u00b11%; p<0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, age \u2265 6 years and WBC \u2265 10 \u00d7 10 9 /L were independent predictors for poor EFS (HR = 1.68, p = 0.003; WBC = 1.79, p = 0.001, respectively), and poor relapse-free survival (HR = 1.99; p = 0.001; HR = 1.55; p = 0.04, respectively). DS patients with age <6 years and WBC <10 \u00d7 10 9 /L constituted a favourable risk-group when compared to the remaining DS patients but still had a relatively high relapse rate (EFS, 78\u00b13% vs. 58\u00b13%; p <0.001, TRM, 3\u00b11% vs. 9\u00b11%; p =0.002, CIR, 17\u00b13% vs. 30\u00b12%; p = 0.003). This criterion was a better predictor of outcome than that in classic NCI-criteria, even after exclusion of patients with TEL-AML1 rearrangement or trisomies 4 and 10. Of the 444 (68%) patients with available cytogenetic data, 40.3% had normal cytogenetics, 9.0% was high hyperdiploid (HeH) (34% in non-DS ALL; p<0.001), 8.3% had TEL-AML1 rearrangements (21.7% in non-DS ALL; p <0.001), and 2% had t(8;14)(q11.2)(q32). Remarkably, the 8-year EFS was nearly identical between TEL-AML1- rearranged DS and non-DS patients (95\u00b14% vs.92\u00b13%; p=0.77). HeH DS patients showed a trend towards lower EFS when compared to HeH non-DS patients (77\u00b17% vs. 86\u00b12%; p=0.06). Within HeH DS ALL patients, the number of patients with trisomy 4+10 was only 45%. The OS of these patients was 88\u00b18%, and there were no relapses. Data on CRLF2 aberrations and JAK2 R683 mutations was available for 134 and 141 patients, respectively. Neither CRLF2 aberrations (OS 74\u00b15%; p=0.29, CIR 29\u00b16%; p=0.23) nor JAK2 mutations predict prognosis in DS ALL (OS 71\u00b18%; p=0.21, CIR 25\u00b19%; p=0.55). In total, 32% (n=16) of TRM's in DS patients occurred during remission induction, most (n=10) were caused by infection. The inclusion of anthracyclines in induction had no impact on TRM. When comparing NCI-SR patients of the CCG/POG studies (3-drug induction) with patients treated on AIEOP/BFM-studies (4-drug-induction) the incidence of TRM was 1.5\u00b11% vs. 1.7\u00b11%; p= 0.46). Also the EFS was similar (64\u00b16% vs. 69\u00b15%; p= 0.39). There was no distinct decrease of TRM after induction, it was not related to a specific treatment-phase or treatment-regimen and also occurred 2 years after diagnosis (\u223c1%), suggesting better supportive care throughout the treatment is needed. In conclusion, DS patients enrolled in contemporary protocols with curative intent continued to have a poor survival due to both high rates of relapse and TRM. Within DS ALL, patients age < 6 year, WBC <10 \u00d7 10 9 /L and the presence of TEL-AML1 or trisomies 4 and 10 are favourable prognostic factors, which may be used to guide risk-directed treatment.
