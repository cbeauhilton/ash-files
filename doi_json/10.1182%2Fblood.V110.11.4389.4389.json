    "abstract_text": "Owing to the advances made in the fields of immunology and molecular biology, identification of biological factors with potential factors with potential prognostic signficance in HL were tried aiming to prevent primary resistance or relapse with as efficient first-line of treatment as possible . biological markers as cell cycle molecules (MDM) and adhesion molecules (CD44V6) were studied in current research on 100 cases of already diagnosed HL of different subtypes using specific monclonal antibodies and Envision detection kit as a staining system. The 100 cases studied comprised 70 males and 30 females, in a ratio of 7:3. The cases were retrived from files of pathology department, El-Maddi Hospital, cairo, Egypt from 1990\u20132000. The age ranged between 11\u201368 years with mean age in males of 40.8+/\u2212 13.39 years in males and 35.8 +/\u2212 18.9 in females. Cases were reclassified according to WHO classfication, 2002. Follow up period of 5 years was obtained from files of all patients including 2-years free disease and 5 years overall survival. In 53% of cases studied (53/100) a variable proprtion of H&RS cells expressed MDM2 that was strictly confined to the nuclei, particularly the nucleoplasm, while 30% (30/100)of the studied cases expressed CD44V6 as membranous staining with a variable proprtion In H&RS cells. A significant staistical correlation between expression of MDM2& CD44v6 with both age groups (P0.05 & P>0.001) respectively were found. An inverse signficant stastical correlation between MDM2 expression and both 2 years free and 5-years free survival (P> 0.001 & P0.001 & P< 0.001) respectively. A strong signficant correlation between MDM2 and CD44V6 immunoreasctivites was expressed (P< 0.001). Our findings suggest that combined use of MDM2 and CD44v6 could be powerful prognostic factor in both presdiction of relapse and overall survival.",
