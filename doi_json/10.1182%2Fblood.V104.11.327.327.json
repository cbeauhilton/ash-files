    "abstract_text": "The \u03b1IIb\u03b23 headpiece (\u03b1IIb, 1\u2013621; \u03b23, 1\u2013472) was expressed in CHO cells, purified, digested with chymotrypsin, mixed with either mAb 10E5 Fab (form A) or without (form B), repurified, digested with carboxypeptidase (leaving \u03b1IIb, 1\u2013452 and \u03b23, 1\u2013440) and crystallized with PEG, Mg acetate, and Na cacodylate at 4\u00b0C. Cocrystallization of \u03b1IIb\u03b23/10E5 (A) with eptifibatide or tirofiban was with imidazole instead of cacodylate. Crystals were diffracted at APS and CHESS and analyzed by HKL2000, AMoRe, O, CNS, and CCP4 software. Crystal forms A and B contain 1 and 3 molecules/asymmetric unit (2.7\u20133.1 and 2.9 A\u030a resolution), respectively. Ca 2+ was assigned at the 4 \u03b1IIb \u03b2-hairpin sites in blades 4\u20137, and I-like (\u03b2A) LIMBS and ADMIDAS; Mg 2+ was assigned to MIDAS. The major findings are: 1) As compared to unliganded \u03b1V\u03b23, \u03b1IIb\u03b23 has a ~62\u00b0 outward pivot of the \u03b23 hybrid domain from the I-like (\u03b2A) domain, indicating adoption of an open, high affinity conformation driven by cacodylate or the Asp (D) carboxyl of the drugs binding to MIDAS and acting as activating ligand equivalents. 2) The \u03b1IIb ligand binding cleft is rigid and includes \u03b1IIb D224 [end-on H bond to ligand Lys (K) or Arg (R)] and hydrophobic residues F160, Y190, and F231, accounting for the selective binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 (vs \u03b1V\u03b23) of KGD and homoarginine-GDW peptides, fibrinogen \u03b3-chain peptide, eptifibatide, and tirofiban. 3) 10E5 Fab interacts with a unique \u201ccap\u201d subdomain in \u03b1IIb formed by 4 insertions in \u03b2-propeller loops in blades 1\u20133 that form a \u03b2-sheet and \u03b1-helix structure involved in ligand binding. 4) Comparison of unliganded \u03b1V\u03b23 and liganded \u03b1IIb\u03b23 indicates that receptor activation and ligand binding involves: extensive movement of \u03b23 subunit \u03b21-\u03b11 loop and \u03b11 helix, and \u03b26-\u03b17 loop and \u03b17 helix; alterations in the coordinating residues at the ADMIDAS, MIDAS, and LIMBS; and breaking the ADMIDAS Ca 2+ coordination by the M335 backbone carbonyl (providing a mechanism by which Mn 2+ , which competes with Ca 2+ at the ADMIDAS but has a lower propensity for carbonyl coordination than Ca 2+ , activates integrins). The 62\u00b0 pivot results from a one-turn piston-like displacement of the \u03b17 helix involving a hydrophobic ratchet of the \u03b26-\u03b17 loop; a ratchet motion of the \u03b11-helix in which L134 moves to the space previously occupied by V340; and complete remodeling at the interface between the \u03b23 I-like (\u03b2A) and hybrid domains. 5) The structure of the \u03b23 PSI domain reveals that the long range disulfide is between \u03b23 C13 (rather than C5) and C435, and comparison to the PSI of semaphorin 4D demonstrates that C435 is an integral part of the PSI domain fold. Thus, the I-like (\u03b2A) domain appears to be inserted in the hybrid domain, which is inserted in the PSI domain. 6) The structure reveals the location of the Leu/Pro-33 PSI polymorphism responsible for the HPA1 alloantigen. At a rigid interface with the hybrid domain, polymorphism of Arg93 demonstrates the requirement of the hybrid/PSI interface for alloantigenicity at Leu-33. Overall, the structure reveals how allostery regulates ligand binding affinity of \u03b1IIb\u03b23, and how the outward swing of the lever-like hybrid and PSI domains communicates the conformation of the ligand binding site to the \u03b1 and \u03b2 leg domains, and to the membrane and cytosol.",
