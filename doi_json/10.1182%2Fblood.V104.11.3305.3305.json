    "abstract_text": "To comparatively assess first-line treatment with cladribine alone (C) or in combination with cyclophosphamide (CC), and COP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone) in low grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), previously untreated patients (pts) with Ann Arbor stage II\u2013IV were randomly allocated to receive 6 monthly courses of either C, CC, or COP. End points were treatment response, freedom from progression (FFP) and overall survival (OS), and tolerance. From June 1, 2000, 165 pts were randomized in 17 centers. The first interim analysis performed at July 1, 2004 included 105 out of 165 randomized pts (63.6%) who have completed at least six cycles of the scheduled chemotherapy. Of 105 analyzed pts, 38 (36.2%) were diagnosed as small lymphocytic, lymphoplasmocytoid 8 (7.6%), marginal-zone 22 (21%), follicular 33 (31.4%), and not otherwise specified low grade B-cell NHL 4 (3.8%). Randomization constituted comparable groups, including international Prognostic Index variables. Compared to C and CC, COP induced lower overall response rates (75%, 85%, 51%, \u03c7 2 test p<.005), including lower complete remission rates (43%, 62.5%, 5.5%, \u03c7 2 test p<.001). With a median follow-up of 10 months, median FFP was superior in patients receiving cladribine containing regimens (8 versus 11 versus 6 months, respectively, \u03c7 2 = 15.1, log-rank test p<.001). No difference in median OS was detected (9 versus 12 versus 7 months, respectively, \u03c7 2 = 1.15, log-rank test p=.56). Incidences of infections (7% versus 15% versus 11%) and non-hematological side effects (7% versus 7.5% versus 16%) were similar in the randomize groups, whereas CC but not C induced more frequent cytopenias compared to COP (30% versus 11%, \u03c7 2 test p<.05). This resulted in more frequent intervals\u2019 prolongation between CC versus COP cycles (respectively 32.5% and 11%, \u03c7 2 test p<.05) but dose reductions because of hematological or other toxicity were comparable in C, CC, and COP groups (11% versus 17.5% versus 5.5%). In pts with low grade B-cell NHL, first line C and CC regimens provided similar response rates, FFP, and OS, which were superior to those obtained with COP. The first interim analysis has resulted in discontinuation of accrual in the COP arm. An observed trend toward a better tolerance of C over CC, which may influence the choice between these regimens as front-line treatments, warrants larger number of pts and longer follow-up."
