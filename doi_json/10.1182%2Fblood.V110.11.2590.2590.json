    "abstract_text": "Inefficient transduction, poor long term expression, and engraftment failure of ex vivo manipulated cells have slowed the practical advancement of gene therapy trials. Thus, the ability to select for or amplify a population of cells that has been modified to express a gene of interest might enhance the effectiveness of gene therapy. Strategies for in vivo expansion of genetically modified cells that have been studied to date have relatively high toxicity or low efficacy in selection of hematopoietic stem cells. We hypothesized that resistance to the purine analog 6-thioguanine (6TG) could be programmed via lentiviruses, and that treatment with 6TG would allow for selection of genetically modified cells in vitro and in vivo . Using short hairpin RNAs, we achieved efficient knockdown of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT kd ), the enzyme required for 6TG cytotoxicity, in the murine hematopoietic progenitor cell line FL5.12. In so doing we were able to provide Fl5.12 cells with resistance to 6TG. In the presence of 6TG, HPRT kd cells continued to proliferate for at least 30 days, whereas control transduced cells ceased proliferating after 7-10 days. 6TG treatment of mixed cultures of GFP + -HPRT kd cells and untransduced cells resulted in selective outgrowth of HPRT kd cells. Knockdown of HPRT in FL5.12 cells was found to attenuate the checkpoint activation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis seen in control transduced cells when treated with 6TG. Knockdown of HPRT in murine primary hematopoietic cells also allowed for selection of transduced cells with 6TG ex vivo. Furthermore, and most importantly, after transduction of whole bone marrow and transplantation into sub-lethally irradiated recipient mice, a single, short course of treatment with 6TG resulted in up to 12 fold greater percentages of circulating transduced granulocytes as compared to untreated controls. These results suggest that genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells can be selected in vivo using 6TG. This strategy may be useful for therapy of a variety of hematopoietic diseases, particularly those that affect hematopoietic progenitors. The benefits of this strategy include the following: 1) the use of a lentivirus with a self inactivating long terminal repeat, 2) a very short cassette encoding drug resistance, making the vector easier to manipulate, and 3) a very well tolerated and relatively non-toxic medication for selection."
