    "abstract_text": "Objective: To explore the non-genetic prognostic factors in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Methods: Kaplan-Meier survival curve,  Log-rank test and Cox regression model were used to carry out univariate and multivariate analysis on clinical and laboratory parameters of 51 MM patients who were newly diagnosed with MM and had complete follow-up data in the Department of Hematology, Jiangning Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing From November 2011 to October 2012. Results: Of the 51 patients, 29 were male and 22 were female. Followed up to December 2019, 21 died and 30 survived. The univariate analysis showed the prognosis was influenced by factors including age, disease stage, standard treatment, new drugs, maintenance treatment, hypercalcemia,  globulin, albumin, hemoglobin. Patients aged <65 years, with ISS stage I and II, with standardized treatment, with new drugs, with normal or below normal blood calcium, with normal or below normal globulin, with albumin \u2265 35g/L or patients with hemoglobin \u2265100g/L have longer survival time. The multivariate analysis showed that maintenance treatment,  hypercalcemia and hemoglobin were independent risk factors influencing the prognosis of MM patients. Conclusion: Patients with blood calcium \u2265 2.6mmol/L, hemoglobin <100g/L and those who do not undergo regular maintenance therapy have a poor prognosis.
