    "abstract_text": "Background: Congenital factor VII (FVII) deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder caused by mutations in F7 gene with autosomal recessive inheritance. A clinical heterogeneity with poor correlation with FVII:C levels has been described. Aim of this study was to identify genetic defects and to evaluate their relationships with clinical phenotype in a large cohort of 1228 white patients with FVII:C below the age-dependent cut-off %. Methods: Probands with confirmed inherited factor VII deficiency were i) genotyped (Sanger method & multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification [MLPA]) for F7 mutations including common polymorphic variants and were ii) classified according to clinical bleeding scores (BC). In addition, common thrombophilic variants and blood groups were determined. Results: Probands included asymptomatic subjects (referred for laboratory work up of recurrent prolonged prothrombin time; n=415; mean age 30 + 19 yrs.; female 52%) and patients who presented with mild, moderate or severe bleeding episodes (n=805; mean age 34 + 18 yrs.; female 70%). Bleeding symptoms included epistaxis, gum bleeding, GI bleeding, hematuria, postoperative and gynecologic hemorrhage. Median FVII activity (entire cohort) measured with clotting-based assays (ACL TOP 750 and/or BCS-XP) was 49% (range 5-78%) and the median ISTH BS recorded within a period of two years prior to work-up was 1(0-17). The latter was significantly higher in women compared with males (2 versus 1; p < 0.001). The corresponding PBAC-Score prior to hormonal treatment was 163 (25-1200). Blood group 0 was present in 40.6% of cases. Known and novel mutations in the F7 gene, including coding regions, exon/intron boundaries and the promoter region, are found in 534 patients (44%) and common polymorphisms were detected in 666 subjects (95%). Logistic regression analysis adjusted for clinical and laboratory data (blood group, FVII activity, presence of F7 gene mutations and /or polymorphisms, thrombophilia status and further factor deficiencies) revealed that older age (increase per year) at referral (odds/95% CI: 1.01/1.007-1.025) and female gender (odds/95% CI: 3.25/2.35-4.50) in part explain differences in clinical bleeding phenotype associated with FVII deficiency. Conclusion: Overall there is poor correlation between the FVII level and the bleeding phenotype. Older patients and females are more likely to have symptomatic disease as a result of gynecological or muco-cutaneous bleeding.
