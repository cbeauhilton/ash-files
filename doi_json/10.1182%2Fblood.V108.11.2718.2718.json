    "abstract_text": "SGN-30 is a monoclonal antibody directed against the CD30 antigen expressed on some hematologic malignancies. Based on encouraging phase I data, a multicenter phase II study was conducted treating patients with refractory or recurrent CD30-positive ALCL with an ECOG performance status of \u2264 2. Thirty-nine patients (24M, 15F) with ALCL were enrolled, with a median age of 57 (range 23\u201382) and a median of 3 prior therapies (range 2\u20135). Nine patients had previously received a stem cell transplant. Eighty-five percent of tumors were negative for ALK, a poor prognostic factor. SGN-30 was administred at 6 mg/kg/wk (90 minute infusion, premedications were not required) for 6 consecutive weeks. After 24 patients were enrolled, the dose was escalated to 12 mg/kg/wk in subsequent patients. (Patients with stable disease or objective response were eligible to receive additional cycles of SGN-30. Five patients received \u2265 2 cycles of SGN-30.) Response assessments, as determined by CT scans, were performed 2 weeks after the last infusion. Best response is shown below:  CR . PR . SD . PD . Pending Eval . ORR . *Both CRs have ongoing durations of >365 days; both patients received additional cycles of SGN-30. **PRs had durations of 27, 53, 139 and 167 days; two additional patients have ongoing durations of 86+ and 25+ days. ***Three SDs have ongoing durations of 96+, 365+, and 365+ days. Two additional patients had SD for 71 and 174 days. 2* 6** 5*** 24 2 21% CR . PR . SD . PD . Pending Eval . ORR . *Both CRs have ongoing durations of >365 days; both patients received additional cycles of SGN-30. **PRs had durations of 27, 53, 139 and 167 days; two additional patients have ongoing durations of 86+ and 25+ days. ***Three SDs have ongoing durations of 96+, 365+, and 365+ days. Two additional patients had SD for 71 and 174 days. 2* 6** 5*** 24 2 21% View Large Three drug-related toxicities \u2265 Grade 3 were reported (each was considered possibly related to SGN-30): 1) lymphopenia, 2) catheter related infection and 3) urticaria. No other significant hematologic or biochemical toxicities have been observed. There was one definitely related serious adverse event (Grade 2) in a patient who experienced a transient exacerbation of his cutaneous lesions after 2 doses of SGN-30 but achieved a partial response after continuing on study. This phase II study represents one of the largest prospectively designed trials in relapsed/refractory ALCL and demonstrates good tolerability and clinically meaningful antitumor activity of SGN-30, especially in ALK negative patients who have a particularly poor prognosis.",
