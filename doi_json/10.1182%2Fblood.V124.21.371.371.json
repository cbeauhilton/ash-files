    "abstract_text": "Background : It has been suggested that using an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) rather than non-Hodgkin lymphoma protocol to treat patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) might be associated with better results ( Hoelzer, Best Pract Res Clin Haematol 2002 ). To address this issue, the GRAALL and LYSA groups have conducted the Phase 2 LL03 trial in adult patients with LL, using the GRAALL-2003 protocol, which yielded good results in adult patients with ALL ( Huguet, JCO 2009 ). Patients and Methods : Between 2004 and 2012, 155 patients aged 18-59 years were enrolled, including 131 evaluable patients with T-cell LL (T-LL). The pediatric-inspired ALL treatment included a corticosteroid prephase, a 5-drug induction with sequential cyclophosphamide, high dose consolidation, late intensification, CNS prophylaxis with IT injections and cranial irradiation, and a 2-year maintenance. Response, including complete remission (CR) and unconfirmed CR (CRu), were assessed using Cheson criteria ( Cheson, JCO 1999 ). Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) was offered to CR/CRu patients with high-risk disease (defined as need for a second-induction salvage course and/or CNS disease) and a donor. Results : Of 131 T-LL patients (median age, 33 years; M/F ratio 4.0; mediastinal enlargement, 95%; CNS involvement, 5%), 119 patients (91%) reached CR/CRu (30 patients needing a salvage course) and 34 relapsed. Response evaluation was based on CT scan, as PET scan was performed in only 73/131 and 20/30 patients after first induction and salvage, respectively. At 5 years, estimated DFS, EFS and overall survival were 71%, 61% and 66%, respectively. The lymphoma IPI-score had no prognostic value, but increased serum LDH level (observed in 71% of the patients) was associated with a significant decrease in EFS (HR = 2.8 [1.3 \u2013 6.1]) and OS (HR = 3.5 [1.4 \u2013 9.1]) in multivariable analysis. Of note, need for a salvage course was not associated with shorter DFS in CR/CRu patients. In a subset of 49 patients studied for oncogenetic markers, the 4-gene risk classifier (based on NOTCH1 , FBXW7 , N/K-RAS and PTEN status) we have recently reported to be a powerful predictor in T-ALL patients ( Trinquand, JCO 2013 ) also demonstrated strong prognostic value in T-LL. Among these patients, 29 (60%) had a high-risk genetic profile (defined as no NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutation and/or N/K-RAS mutation and/or PTEN deletion). At 3 years, the high-risk genetic profile was predictive of shorter EFS (HR = 14.3 [1.9 \u2013 107.8]), DFS (HR = 9.5 [1.2 \u2013 74.3]) and OS (HR = 11.5 [1.5 \u2013 87.5]) in univariable analysis, as well as in multivariable analysis after adjustment on age, ECOG-PS and LDH level (HR = 20.5 [2.6 \u2013 164.1], 12.6 [1.5 \u2013 104.8] and 17.0 [2.1 \u2013 136.8], respectively. A total of 30 CR/CRu patients were eligible for allogeneic SCT (25 for late CR/CRu, 4 for CNS involvement, and 1 for both criteria) and 17 of them were actually transplanted in first CR/CRu. When analysed as a time-dependent event, allogeneic SCT was not associated with prolonged DFS in these high-risk patients. Finally, Grade III/IV adverse events were those commonly observed with the GRAALL regimen. Overall, 46 patients died during the study (37 after relapse or progression; 5 during induction; 3 from allograft toxicity and 1 after a highway accident). Conclusion : As compared to historical studies, we report here a relatively good outcome in T-LL patients treated with a pediatric-inspired ALL strategy. Very interestingly, the NOTCH1/FBXW7/RAS/PTEN T-ALL risk classification was also a strong prognostic factor in these T-LL patients. Allogeneic SCT did not appear to significantly influence the outcome of selected T-LL patients. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
