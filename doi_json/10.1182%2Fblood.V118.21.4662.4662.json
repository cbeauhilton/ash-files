    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4662 Introduction Today, the development of inhibitors against Factor VIII (FVIII) and Factor IX (FIX) is seen as the most serious complication of haemophilia A and B therapy. Recent studies on the role of the causative haemophilic mutation, race and ethnicity, family history of inhibitors and the possible influence of HLA genotype in inhibitor formation have revealed new and exciting insights. That is challenging conventional thinking about inhibitor development risk and type of factor products, recombinant or plasma-derived. The use of recombinant factor concentrates has revolutionized the treatment of severe factor VIII and IX deficiency. One of the most important complications is the development of antibodies (Inhibitors). Material and Methods Ninety two patients with haemophilia A and 12 patients with Haemophilia B have been studied. Confirmatory tests including one stage FVIII and FIX assay has been performed using STA Deficient FVIII and FIX, an immune-depleted plasma intended in plasma by analyzers of the STA line suitable with these reagents (Diagnostica Stago,France).Presence of Factor VIII and IX inhibitors have been tested by Bethesda Assay. All of the patients use mostly plasma-derived factor products, and on-demand treatment. Results Among 92 haemophilia A patients, FVIII levels were between 0.14\u201314.40 IU/dl (mean 2.91 \u00b1 2.62), FIX levels were between 0.17 to 4.37 IU/dl (mean 1.53 \u00b1 1.38) in12 haemophilia B patients. PT activity was 68.7\u2013134 (mean 101.05 \u00b1 15.13), APTT was 28.90 \u2013 102 (mean 60.66 \u00b1 13.50). FVIII inhibitor levels were between 0\u20131.14 BU (mean 0.04 \u00b1 0.20) in 5 severe Hemophilia A patients (5.45%) and FIX Inhibitor levels were between 0\u20130.65 BU (mean 0.10 \u00b1 0.23) in 2 Hemophilia B patients. Discussion Alloantibodies (inhibitors) against FVIII or FIX represent a major complication in patient care because they render classical substitution therapy ineffective. Inhibitors occur at a frequency of 20\u201330% in severe and 3\u201313% with mild or moderate haemophilia A, and 3% in haemophilia B, respectively. An alternative pathomechanism may underlie inhibitor development in patients with mild hemophilia A. Although it has been reported that inhibitors in patients with mild haemophilia are related to periods of intensive treatment or surgery, this has never been properly studied in children with severe haemophilia. The low inhibitor rate with Low Titers in our patients may be demonstrate the role of type of factor products, recombinant or plasma-derived, which in this study was mostly use of plasma-derived factor products, and on-demand treatment. Also detailed evaluation of major risk factors of development of Factor VIII and IX inhibitors in our patients is required. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
