    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4708 Objective To investigate the relationship between cytokines and human graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Methods In 21 patients undergoing allo-HSCT, the plasma concentrations of cytokines (interleukin 2(IL-2), soluble interleukin 2 recepter (sIL-2R), interferon-gama (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin 4(IL-4), transforming growth fator-beta1(TGF-\u03b21)) were measured by using sandwich enzyme-linked immunological assay (ELISA) and the gene messanger RNA expressions of these five cytokines were analysed by using semi-quantitate reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results 1. The concentrations and gene messanger RNA expressions of IL-2, sIL-2R and IFN-\u03b3 in the patients with GVHD were significantly higher than those without GVHD ( P <0.01); these three cytokines expression levels in the patients with aGVHD were higher than with cGVHD and without GVHD ( P <0.05); The levels of IL-4 showed no difference between the patients with or without GVHD ( P >0.05); the levels of TGF-\u03b21 in the patients with GVHD were significantly declined ( P <0.01) but in those without aGVHD were obviously increased ( P <0.05). After effective treatment, unnormal IL-2, sIL-2R, IFN-\u03b3 and TGF-\u03b21 expressions recovered to the levels before transplantation. 2. The results of multivariate logistic regression modles and Kaplan-Meier survival curves analyses showed: age, sex, infection, HLA-matched, blood type, conditioning regiment and the times of absolute neutrophil counts and platelets recovering to normal, had no association with the incidence of GVHD ( P >0.05). A multivariate COX survival function modle analysis showed IL-2, sIL-2R and TGF-\u03b21 are independent prognostic factors for GVHD (=11.149, P <0.0001). 3. The results of IL-2, sIL-2R, IFN-\u03b3 and TGF-\u03b21 measured by RT-PCR and ELISA for detecting peripheral blood cytokines expression levels had no difference. Conclusions 1. IL-2, sIL-2R, IFN-\u03b3 and TGF-\u03b21 play important roles in the development of GVHD after allo-HSCT. Monitoring the changes of IL-2, sIL-2R, IFN-\u03b3 and TGF-\u03b21 expression levels (especially IL-2, sIL-2R and TGF-\u03b21) might provide predictive markers for GVHD, especially aGVHD. 2. Different conditioning regiments resultes in different IL-2, sIL-2R, IFN-\u03b3 and TGF-\u03b21 expression levels. 3. IL-4 expression had no effect on the developing of GVHD after allo-HSCT. 4. The sensitivity between RT-PCR and ELISA for detecting peripheral blood cytokines expression levels had no difference. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
