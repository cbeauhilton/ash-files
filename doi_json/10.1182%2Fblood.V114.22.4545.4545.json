    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4545 The use of Peripherally-Inserted Central Catheters (PICC) as an alternative to Central Venous Catethers (CVC) is becoming very frequent in different setting of patients. To highlight the role of PICC also in patients with haematological malignancies, we revised our single Institute experience from 11/2008 to 7/2009. On the whole, 33 PICCs (BARD Groshong 4 Fr) were inserted in 32 patients [M/F 11/21, median age 59.9 years, Interquartile Range (IR) 47.1 \u2013 74.7] for a total number of 1979 days. Twelve patients had Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), 3 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), 6 Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), 5 Hodgkin Lymphoma (HD), 6 Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Disorders (MDS/MPD); as to disease phase, 6 patients were at onset, 10 in complete response (3 before consolidation therapy and 7 before autologous peripheral stem-cell transplantation), 5 at disease relapse, 7 in chronic phase with transfusional requirement and 4 in advanced phase. PICC was successfully inserted in all cases with US-guide (in 21 cases via basilica vein, in 11 via brachial vein and in 1 via cephalic vein). At insertion, platelets count was < 50 \u00d7 10 9 /l in 17/33 cases (51.5%) while WBC count was < 1.0 \u00d7 10 9 /l in 6/33 cases (18.1%). An accidental PICC extraction occurred after 13 days; in addition, there were 2/33 (6.0%) (0,03/1000 gg) thrombophlebitic complications after 15 and 21 days respectively and 6/33 (18.1%)(0.10/1000 gg) infective complications [4 sepsis catheter-related from Staphylococci (3) or Acromobacter (1) and 2 local flogistic infiltration]. On the whole, 17/33 PICCs (51.5%) were removed after a median period of 39 days (IR 17 \u2013 64); the reasons for removal were completion of treatment in 4 patients, death unrelated to the PICC in 6 and catheter-related complications in 7 (5 for infection, 1 for thrombosis and 1 for accidental extraction). The remaining 16/33 PICCs (48.5%) are still in use after a median period of 73 days (IR 30 \u2013 93). In conclusion, PICC seems to be a useful, safe and promising alternative to conventional CVC for many haematological malignancies in a wide spectrum of clinical settings, ranging from intensive chemotherapy (including autotransplant procedure) to chronic management and very advanced phases requiring palliative approach.
