    "abstract_text": "Vitamin D deficient patients suffering from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with R-CHOP have lower overall survival. This especially applies for patients with vitamin D levels \u22648 ng/ml (Bittenbring et al. J Clin Oncol. 2014; 32:3242-8). Vitamin D up to 65 ng/ml may be necessary for optimal efficacy of R-CHOP (Neumann et al. Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2018; 67:1709-18). To study the clinical benefit of vitamin D substitution, we established a fast-track schedule to appropriately substitute patients to these vitamin D levels. The pre-treatment baseline vitamin D level was determined in 99 patients included in the ongoing, randomized, multicenter, phase-III, open-label OPTIMAL>60 trial (NCT01478542) from November 2014 to July 2015. It was intended that patients reach a vitamin D level of 65 ng/ml. We calculated the dose needed using patient weight and baseline vitamin D: IU = 100 x \u0394VitD3 x kg body weight (Van Groningen et al. Eur J Endocrinol. 2010; 162:805-11) and substitution started before treatment. Patients received 20.000 IU capsules of vitamin D, split over several days, with a daily maximum of 200.000 IU. Vitamin D level was checked again after substitution and at all restagings. Patients, who did not reach the intended vitamin D level of 65 ng/ml, received a second or third cycle of substitution. Baseline vitamin D level was 17.8\u00b112.7 ng/ml. 14.3% of the patients reached the target value of up to 65 ng/ml after one substitution cycle with a mean dose of 386.000\u00b1137.000 IU. The average increase was 27.8 ng/ml, to a mean of 45.6\u00b118.7 ng/ml. After the second substitution cycle with a median dose of 188.000\u00b1102.000 IU patients had vitamin D serum levels of 52.6\u00b113.8 ng/ml. After a third substitution with 91.000\u00b156.000 IU mean level of vitamin D was 56.0\u00b19.6 ng/ml. By administering vitamin D in a dosage calculated by the van Groningen formula, we were able to increase the vitamin D level of our patients reliably after 2-3 cycles of substitution. After second and third substitution, a saturation effect was seen. The clinical effect of vitamin D substitution is the subject of the current study and the results are presently pending.
