    "abstract_text": "Introduction Activation of the PI3K pathway triggers multiple events including cell growth, cell cycle entry, cell survival and motility. While \u03b1 and \u03b2 isoforms are ubiquitous in their distribution, expression of \u03b4 and \u03b3 is restricted to cells of the hematopoietic system. Because these isoforms contribute to the development, maintenance, transformation, and proliferation of immune cells, dual targeting of PI3K\u03b4 and \u03b3 represents a promising approach in the treatment of lymphomas. The objective of the experiments was to explore the therapeutic potential of RP6530, a novel, small molecule PI3K\u03b4/\u03b3 inhibitor, in B-cell lymphomas. Methods Activity and selectivity of RP6530 for PI3K\u03b4 and \u03b3 isoforms and subsequent downstream activity was determined in enzyme and cell-based assays. Additionally, RP6530 was tested for potency in viability, apoptosis, and Akt phosphorylation assays using a range of immortalized B-cell lymphoma cell lines (Raji, TOLEDO, KG-1, JEKO, OCI-LY-1, OCI-LY-10, MAVER, and REC-1). Viability was assessed using the colorimetric MTT reagent after incubation of cells for 72 h. Inhibition of pAKT was estimated by Western Blotting and bands were quantified using ImageJ after normalization with Actin. Primary cells from lymphoid tumors [1 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 2 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), 2 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), 1 splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), and 1 extranodal MZL (EMZL)] were isolated, incubated with 4 \u00b5M RP6530, and analyzed for apoptosis or cytotoxicity by Annexin V/PI staining. Results RP6530 demonstrated high potency against PI3K\u03b4 (IC 50 =24.5 nM) and \u03b3 (IC 50 =33.2 nM) enzymes with selectivity over \u03b1 (>300-fold) and \u03b2 (>100-fold) isoforms. Cellular potency was confirmed in target-specific assays, namely anti-Fc\u03b5R1-(EC 50 =37.8 nM) or fMLP (EC 50 =39.0 nM) induced CD63 expression in human whole blood basophils, LPS induced CD19+ cell proliferation in human whole blood (EC 50 =250 nM), and LPS induced CD45R+ cell proliferation in mouse whole blood (EC 50 =101 nM). RP6530 caused a dose-dependent inhibition (>50% @ 2-7 \u03bcM) in growth of immortalized (Raji, TOLEDO, KG-1, JEKO, REC-1) B-cell lymphoma cells. Effect was more pronounced in the DLBCL cell lines, OCI-LY-1 and OCI-LY-10 (>50% inhibition @ 0.1-0.7 \u03bcM), and the reduction in viability was accompanied by corresponding inhibition of pAKT with EC 50 of 6 & 70 nM respectively. Treatment of patient-derived primary cells with 4 \u00b5M RP6530 caused an increase in cell death. Fold-increase in cytotoxicity as evident from PI+ staining was 1.6 for CLL, 1.1 for DLBCL, 1.2 for MCL, 2.2 for SMZL, and 2.3 for EMZL. Cells in early apotosis (Annexin V+/PI-) were not different between the DMSO blank and RP6530 samples. Conclusions RP6530 is a potent and selective dual PI3K\u03b4/\u03b3 inhibitor that inhibited growth of B-cell lymphoma cell lines with a concomitant reduction in the downstream biomarker, pAKT. Additionally, the compound showed cytotoxicity in a panel of lymphoma primary cells. Findings provide a rationale for future clinical trials in B-cell malignancies.
