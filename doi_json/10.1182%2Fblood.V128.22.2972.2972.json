    "abstract_text": "Background WM remains an incurable cancer despite recent advances. While a phase II trial has demonstrated efficacy of dexamethasone, rituximab and cyclophosphamide (DRC) in the treatment-na\u00efve (TN) patients, this regimen has not been studied systematically in the relapsed/refractory (R/R) setting. Recent data has suggested the MYD88mutation status in WM patients can serve as a predictive marker with therapies such as ibrutinib. We examined the efficacy and tolerability of up to 6 cycles of DRC, with focus on R/R population and activity of this regimen with respect to the patients' MYD88 L265P status. Methods Records of WM patients seen consecutively at Mayo Clinic campuses in Rochester, Arizona and Florida from 01/2007 to 12/2014 were reviewed. MYD88 L265P status, as assessed by AS-PCR, was recorded when available. Data obtained from symptomatic patients treated with DRC (dexamethasone 20 mg intravenously followed by rituximab 375 mg/m 2 intravenously on day 1 and cyclophosphamide 100 mg/m 2 orally bid on days 1 to 5) were analyzed. Time-to-event analyses were performed from DRC therapy using the Kaplan-Meier method. We used the Consensus response criteria (6 th International Workshop). Results Of 100 symptomatic patients who received DRC, 50 had R/R WM (40% refractory) and 50 were TN. Table 1 shows the patients' baseline characteristics. In the R/R population, DRC was 2nd line (range 2-8) therapy in 58% of patients. The median IgM levels declined from 3,870 mg/dL to 1,846 mg/dL (p=0.0001) at best response. Median follow-up from DRC was 51 months (95% CI: 38-55). The median time-to-best response was 6.8 (0.5-28) months. Overall response rate (ORR) was 87% [VGPR 4%, PR 64%, MR 19%]. Four patients (9%) achieved SD and 2 patients (4%) had PD. Of the sixteen deaths (32%) noted at time of analysis, 11 were related to progressive disease. The median disease-specific survival (DSS) from DRC was not reached (NR) (95% CI: NR-NR). The median progression-free survival (PFS) and time-to-next-therapy (TTNT) were 32 months (95% CI: 15-51) and 50 months (95% CI: 35-60), respectively. In contrast, in the TN patients the median IgM levels declined from 4,130 mg/dL to 1,250 mg/dL (p=0.0001) at best response; median time to best response was 11 (0.6-47) months; median follow-up from DRC was 30 months (95% CI: 21-36). ORR was 96% [VGPR 17% (n=8), PR 70% (n=32), MR 9% (n=4)]. Of the 7 deaths (14%) at time of analysis, 4 were related to WM progression. Median DSS from DRC was NR (95% CI: NR-NR); median PFS and TTNT were 34 months (95% CI: 23-NR) and NR (95% CI: 37-NR), respectively. Among 29 genotyped patients in whom MYD88 mutation status was available, MYD88 L265P was present in 25 patients (8 of 10 TN and 17 of 19 R/R patients). The response rates and the time-to-event outcomes were similar in the MYD88 L265P and wild-type patients. Grade \u22653 adverse effects included neutropenia (20%), thrombocytopenia (7%) and infections (3%). Conclusions Similar to the frontline setting, DRC is an active and well-tolerated salvage regimen. In contrast to ibrutinib, DRC offers a less expensive, limited-duration treatment option, with preliminary data suggesting activity independent of patients' MYD88 mutation status.
