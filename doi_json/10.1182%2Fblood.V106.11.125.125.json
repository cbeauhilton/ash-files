    "abstract_text": "CD34 is the best-defined human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) marker, however the regulation of its gene expression is still largely unknown. Therefore, unraveling the elements that regulate human CD34 expression would be an invaluable tool for a broad range of studies, including the establishment of models of leukemia in mice, which require targeting of the transgene to stem and/or early progenitor cells. Moreover, identification of such regulatory elements will provide important insights into the transcriptional agenda of stem and progenitor cells and most importantly will prove useful for gene therapy protocols. Studies from our laboratory demonstrated that human CD34 transgenes are expressed in murine repopulating HSCs, which resembles the expression of the CD34 gene in human hematopoiesis, thus indicating the mouse model as an excellent way to study the expression of human CD34 . Using P1 derived artificial chromosome (PAC) clones encompassing the human CD34 gene to generate transgenic mice, we showed that 90kb of upstream and 26kb of downstream flanking sequences were capable of regulating human CD34 expression in murine transgenic lines. Successive deletions of this larger construct were then performed to identify the important control regions. Deletion of the 5\u2032 region from \u221290kb to \u221218kb did not result in any loss of activity. PAC54A19, a clone extending from \u221218kb to +26kb, expressed RNA in various tissues in a manner similar to that of larger fragments. In contrast, deletions creating a construct spanning from \u221210kb to +17kb led to complete loss of expression in transgenic animals, indicating that critical distal elements are located between \u221218kb to \u221210kb and/or +17kb to +26kb. In order to facilitate identification of important regulatory elements present in the upstream (\u221218kb to \u221210 kb) and/or downstream (+17kb to +26kb) regions of human CD34 , we created further deletions of PAC54A19 using rare-cutting restriction enzymes, and studied the effects of the deletions on human CD34 expression in transgenic mice. Interestingly, we did not detect any human CD34 mRNA and protein expression in bone marrow and HSCs from transgenic mice carrying a construct spanning from \u221218kb to +17.4kb. In contrast, we observed expression of human CD34 transcripts in the bone marrow of transgenic mice containing a PAC spanning from \u221212.8kb to +26kb. Furthermore, HSCs from this latter group of mice presented the human CD34 antigen on their surface, as detected by FACS. Taken together, these data are highly suggestive that critical cis regulatory element(s) required to drive human CD34 in vivo expression are located in a 8.6kb fragment placed between +17.4kb and +26kb downstream of the human CD34 gene. Our current efforts focus on identifying the element(s) within the 8.6kb 3\u2032 region that might be required to achieve human CD34 expression in HSCs.",
