    "abstract_text": "Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism to reverse the drug resistance of leukemia cells in Cyclosporine A(CsA) , tetrandrine (Tet) alone or their combination by using empirical methods, and to provide the basic evidence for further study, and lay the theoretical basis for the clinical applications. Method: By MTT assay, the IC50(the concentration causing 50% inhibitor of cell growth) of DNR was determined;By flow cytomet ry (FCM) assay, the intracellular DNR concentration and the expression of P-glyco-protein (P-gp) were examined, and the apoptotic changes were observed by Anexin-V. By fluorescent semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the mRNA expression of multidrug resistance (MDR) was measured. Results: The IC50 of DNR for K562 and K562/A02 cells were 0.26mg/l and 21.22mg/l respectively. Treating K562/A02 cells with CsA(1mg/L), TTD(0.1mg/L)and both for 48 hours partially restored the sensitivity of K562/A02 cells to DNR(IC50 were 7.83 mg/L,5.32 mg/L,2.33 mg/L respectively.) but had not effect on K562 cells; K562/A02 cells showed apoptotic characteristics after treated with CsA, and both for 48 hours(Apoptosis rate was 10.27%,17.64%,52.79% respectively); The fluorescence intensity of intracellelar DNR in K562 and K562/A02 cells treated with DNR(1mg/L)was 522,173 respectively. CsA and TTD (alone or combination) elevated the intracellular DNR concentration in K562/A02 cells(the fluorescence intensity of intracellelar DNR in K562/A02 cells was 188,339,515 respectively); The fluorescence intensity of P-gp in K562 and K562/A02 cells was 0.5,97.97. The P-gp expression was down after treated with CsA, TTD and both(73.7,65.05,58.1); mdr1 mRNA was also down regulated, and the effect of their combination was greater. Date was analyzed by SPSS 13.0 software and expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. Conclusions: High expression of P-gp may be involved in the mechanism of multidrug resistance (MDR) of K562/A02 cells line; MDR can be partially reversed by CsA or TTD, of which the combination shows a great synergistic reversal effect."
