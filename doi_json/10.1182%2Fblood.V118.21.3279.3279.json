    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3279 Background: ITP is an autoimmune disorder characterized by increased platelet destruction and suboptimal platelet production. Romiplostim stimulates platelet production via the TPO-receptor, and is recommended for second- and third-line treatment of chronic ITP in adults. We report final data from a large prospective study of romiplostim in adults with ITP of varying duration and severity. Methods: Eligibility criteria were broad: patients \u226518 years of age, who had received prior ITP therapies (final protocol amendment: \u22651, previous amendments: \u22653), with low platelet counts (final amendment: \u2264 30 \u00d7 10 9 /L, previous amendments: \u2264 10, \u2264 20 \u00d7 10 9 /L) or experiencing uncontrolled bleeding. The only excluded comorbidities were: hematological malignancy, myeloproliferative neoplasms, MDS and bone marrow stem cell disorder. Romiplostim was initiated at 1 (final amendment) or 3 (previous amendments) \u03bcg/kg/week, with dose adjustments allowed to maintain platelet counts \u226550 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Patients could continue on study until they had access to commercially available romiplostim. Rescue medications were allowed at any time; concurrent ITP therapies could be reduced when platelet counts were > 50 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Primary endpoint was incidence of adverse events (AEs) and antibody formation. Secondary endpoint was platelet response, defined as either (1) doubling of baseline count and \u2265 50 \u00d7 10 9 /L or (2) \u226520 \u00d7 10 9 /L increase from baseline. Results: A total of 407 patients received romiplostim, 60% of whom were female. Median (Q1, Q3) time since ITP diagnosis was 4.25 (1.20, 11.40) years (maximum 57.1 years), with 51% of patients splenectomised and 39% receiving baseline concurrent ITP therapies. Seventy-one percent of patients completed the study, with requirement for alternative therapy and withdrawn consent the most common reasons for discontinuation (5% each). Median (Q1, Q3) on-study treatment duration was 44.29 (20.43, 65.86) weeks (maximum 201 weeks), with a total of 20,201 subject-weeks on study. Incidence and type of AEs were consistent with previous studies. The most common serious treatment-related AEs were cerebrovascular accident, headache, bone marrow reticulin fibrosis (with no evidence of positive trichrome staining for collagen and no evidence suggesting primary idiopathic myelofibrosis), nausea, deep vein thrombosis, hemorrhage and pulmonary embolism, with each reported in 2 of 407 (0.5%) patients. All other serious treatment-related AEs were each reported in one patient. Eighteen patients died; 3 deaths (hemolysis, intestinal ischaema, aplastic anemia) were considered treatment-related. No neutralizing antibodies to romiplostim or TPO were reported. Approximately 90% of patients achieved each of the platelet response definitions, regardless of splenectomy status. Overall, median (Q1, Q3) time to response was 2 (1, 4) weeks for response definition 1, and 1 (1, 3) week for response definition 2. Median (Q1, Q3) baseline platelet count was 14 (8, 21) \u00d7 10 9 /L. After 1 week of treatment median (Q1, Q3) platelet count had increased to 42 (18, 101) \u00d7 10 9 /L. From week 8 onwards, and excluding counts within 8 weeks of rescue medication use, median platelet counts were consistently above 100 \u00d7 10 9 /L (range 101.0\u2013269.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L). Median (Q1, Q3) average weekly romiplostim dose was 3.62 (1.99, 6.08) \u03bcg/kg. Summary/conclusions: This is the largest prospective study in adult ITP reported to date. The data reported here are similar to those reported for previous romiplostim studies, with romiplostim able to safely induce a rapid platelet response in adult ITP patients with low platelet counts or bleeding symptoms. Romiplostim is an important, well-tolerated, treatment option for adult ITP patients, which significantly increases and maintains platelet counts. Adverse Event Subject Incidence  .
