    "abstract_text": "Background Familial myeloid neoplasms are rare causes of myeloid malignancies. Over the last few years germline mutations involving RUNX1, JAK2, GATA1, GATA2 and CEBPA genes have been associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We carried out this study to describe the spectrum of familial myeloid neoplasms seen at our institution. Methods After due IRB approval, the myeloid neoplasms data base (1990-2012) at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota was queried for patients presenting with, or having a strong family history of myeloid neoplasms. Selective sequencing of germline DNA was done in appropriate patients. Germline mutations that were screened for included; RUNX1, JAK2, GATA1, GATA2 and CEBPA. In one family with none of the aforementioned gene mutations, exome sequencing was performed. Families with chromosomal breakage and primary telomere disorders were excluded. All patients had bone marrow and cytogenetic studies at diagnosis. Results We identified six families with familial myeloid neoplasms ( table one ). There were two with germline GATA2 mutations (no.1 and 2); one with a novel c1339A>C, pS447R, non-zinc finger gene abnormality. In this family nine members have developed MDS/AML. All members had profound B/NK cell deficiency, viral warts and one member had primary lymphedema (Embergers syndrome). Three of the 6 seen at the clinic have successfully undergone allo- SCT. The second GATA2 mutated family had a less extensive history of myeloid neoplasms. There was one patient (no.5) who presented with long standing thrombocytopenia, clinically diagnosed as ITP. She eventually developed MDS with trisomy 8. She had three first degree relatives with myeloid neoplasms. Germline sequencing identified a RUNX1 mutation. Platelet electron microscopy identified characteristic ultrastructural changes. There was one family (no.4) with a germline JAK2V617F mutation. The propositus was diagnosed to have primary myelofibrosis and then demonstrated clonal evolution to a concomitant BCR-ABL1 p190 driven chronic myeloid leukemia. His sister and mother have essential thrombocytosis (ET) and his brother has a detectable JAK2 mutation (no evidence for disease). The patient has successfully undergone an allo-SCT. The patient with a GATA1 mutation (no.3) presented with congenital anemia and had craniofacial anomaly, atrial septal defect and developmental delays. Red cell and platelet ultrastructural abnormalities lead to the diagnosis with an additional family member having chronic anemia and suspected MDS. One family (no.6) presented with seven first degree relatives affected by MDS/AML. Germline sequencing for the aforementioned genes was negative. Exome sequencing has been performed and results should be available at the time of the meeting. The prepositus has successfully undergone allo-SCT. Conclusion Familial myeloid neoplasms are uncommon but warrant early recognition. Clues to diagnosis include strong family history, associated primary immunodeficiency states, morphological/skeletal abnormalities and platelet ultrastructural defects (RUNX1, GATA2, and GATA1). Exome and whole genome sequencing is an exciting prospect for further discoveries. Table 1 Familial Myeloid Neoplasms.  Germline mutation . Age . Sex . Hematologic-al diagnosis . Cytogenetics .
