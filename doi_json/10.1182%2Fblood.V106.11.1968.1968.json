    "abstract_text": "Autologous stem cell transplantation is curative for many patients with hematologic malignancies. Approximately 20% of patients do not have an adequate stem cell mobilization. Recently, work from our laboratories has shown that parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases osteoblast number and expansion of the stem cell compartment in mice. In murine models, the addition of PTH caused an increase in the absolute number of stem cells. Daily PTH injection caused an increase in the absolute number of murine stem cells and improved survival in transplant recipients of limiting numbers of stem cells. ( Nature  425 : 841 , 2003 ). This observation suggested that PTH might be able to increase stem cell numbers in humans. PTH is an FDA approved drug used for treatment of osteoporosis. In this Phase I study, patients who have collected less than 2 million CD34+ cells/kg after 1 or 2 stem cell mobilization attempts received 14 days of sc PTH, in escalating dose cohorts of 40 mcg, 60 mcg, 80 mcg, and 100 mcg per day, with G-CSF 10mcg/kg/day for the last four days. Patients with >5 CD34+/uL on Day +14 proceeded to stem cell apheresis and autologous stem cell transplant. 14 patients have enrolled on this study, now enrolling at the highest dose cohort, and 12 patients have completed treatment for this analysis with 3 patients per dose cohort. The median age was 57 years (range 24\u201371 years), and 9 (75%) patients are female. In 10 patients (83%) one attempt at stem cell mobilization failed with either growth factor alone or growth factor plus chemotherapy; in the other 2 patients (17%) two attempts at mobilization failed to attain adequate cells. The diagnoses were as follows: non Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (7 patients, 58%), Hodgkin\u2019s disease (5 patients, 42%). There were no dose limiting toxicities defined as calcium > 11.5, ionized calcium > 1.5, phosphate <1.0, or systolic blood pressure less than 80mm Hg. 3 patients had a self-limited fever, one patient had an unexplained eosinophilia, and 1 patient required an admission with fever, rigors, and headache. 6 of 12 patients (50%) achieved the target peripheral CD34 level of 5/uL, of whom 4 underwent stem cell apheresis. The median CD34 cells/uL on Day +14 was 4.3 (range 0\u201318.8). 2 patients who achieved the target peripheral CD34 level of 5/uL did not complete collections, 1 due to access problems, and 1 due to physician preference. The 4 patients who continued with the study collected a median CD34+ dose/kg of 2.2 x 10 6 (range 0.9\u20132.7) from stem cell apheresis with a median of 2 collections (range 1\u20134). These 4 patients proceeded to autologous stem cell transplant, with median days to neutrophil and platelet engraftments of 11 (range 10\u201312) and 14 (range 12\u201319), respectively. In conclusion, 1) PTH is well tolerated in this population, even at a dose of 100 mcg; 2) PTH plus G-CSF may be effective in patients that fail primary or secondary stem cell mobilization attempts; 3) PTH plus G-CSF should be tested in a larger Phase II study to improve donor stem cell yield. Future directions may also include the use of parathyroid hormone to improve engraftment efficiency in settings of low stem cell dose such as adult cord blood transplantation.",
