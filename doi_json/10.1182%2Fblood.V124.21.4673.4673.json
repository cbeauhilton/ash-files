    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Although chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) has improved response rates, treatment free survival, and overall survival in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), only 40-50% of patients achieve a complete remission and the majority have residual disease when evaluated using sensitive assays. Interactions with nurturing environments can enhance CLL B-cell resistance to apoptosis. These interactions include cytokine mediated prosurvival signals by angiogenic molecules, such as VEGF and bFGF that nurture CLL B-cells in an autocrine fashion and promote CLL cell survival partly through up regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins. These findings provide a strong rationale for testing anti-VEGF therapy in combination with a purine nucleoside analogue CIT regimen for upfront treatment. We conducted a randomized phase 2 CIT trial using pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab with (PCR-B) or without (PCR) bevacizumab (B), an anti-VEGF monoclonal anti-body. METHODS : Eligible patients were previously untreated and had CLL in need of treatment by NCI-WG criteria (Blood 111:5446). Patients were randomized using a dynamic allocation procedure stratifying for stage (0-II vs. III-IV) and FISH (17p or 11q deletion vs. other) to receive either 6 cycles of rituximab (100 mg on day 1 of cycle 1; 375 mg/m 2 on day 2 of cycle 1 and day 1 of cycles 2-6) followed by pentostatin (2 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) (PCR) administered every 21 days. Patients in the PCR-B cohort also received bevacizumab 15mg/kg on day 1 of cycles 1-5 and days 1, 22, & 43 of cycle 6. All patients underwent complete response evaluation 3 months after day 1 of cycle 6 (or last cycle of treatment for those completing < 6 cycles). MRD was assessed using 6-color flow cytometry (Leukemia 21:956) at the completion of treatment. RESULTS: 68 patients were enrolled through the Mayo Clinic Cancer Research Consortium between 1/2009 and 1/2013. Three patients were excluded from analysis: 1 patient canceled prior to treatment, 1 was dosed incorrectly, and 1 was ineligible due to immunophenotyping inconsistent with CLL. Median age of eligible patients was 63 years (range 43-81) and 43 (66%) were men. With respect to disease stage, 3 (5%), 38 (58%), and 24 (37%) had low, intermediate and high Rai stage disease. Eleven (17%) patients had deletion 17p or 11q & 29 (45%) had unmutated IGHV. No statistically significant differences were observed in these variables by treatment arm. All 65 evaluable patients have completed active treatment, with 54 (83.1%) completing the intended 6 cycles (PCR group 27/32 [84.4%] and PCR-B 27/33 [81.8%]). Hematologic grade 3+ adverse events deemed at least possibly related to treatment were observed in 10 (31.3%) patients on PCR and 12 (36.4%) on PCR-B (p=0.79). Non-hematologic grade 3+ adverse events deemed at least possibly related to treatment were observed in 9 (28.1%) patients on PCR and 18 (54.4%) on PCR-B (p=0.04). The most common such events were hypertension (PCR: 3.1% vs. PCR-B: 21.2%), proteinuria (0% vs. 6.1%) and creatinine increase (3.1% vs. 6.1%). Across both arms, 64/65 (98.5%) patients achieved a response including 31/32 (96.9%) treated with PCR and 33/33 (100%) treated with PCR-B (p=0.49). CR/CRi was achieved in 10/32 (31.3%) patients treated with PCR & 18/33 (54.5%) treated with PCR-B (p=0.08). Of the 28 who achieved a CR/CRi, MRD analysis was completed on 26, of whom 12 (46%) were MRD negative. With respect to treatment arm, 5/32 (16%) patients on PCR and 7/33 (21%) on PCR-B achieved an MRD negative CR. Median time to retreatment for all 65 patients was 44.8 (95% CI: 34.6 \u2013 NA) months. Median overall survival has not yet been reached. With current follow-up no differences between treatment-free survival (p=0.38), progression-free survival (p=0.23), or overall survival (p=0.45) are observed by treatment arm. Plasma levels of angiogenic cytokines VEGF, bFGF, thrombospondin (TSP) and the chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 were measured prior to treatment and at the time of the post treatment response evaluation. Correlations of these cytokines with clinical outcome will be presented. CONCLUSION: The addition of bevacizumab to purine analogue-based CIT was generally well-tolerated and may increase complete remission rates in patients with CLL. No clear improvement in treatment free survival has been observed to date.
