    "abstract_text": "Background: Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is thought to mediate B cell activation by negatively regulating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. This pathway is important for activation, growth, and proliferation. PTEN is involved in maintaining normal B cell function. In immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), enhanced BCR signaling contributes to increased B cell activity, but the role of PTEN in human ITP has remained unclear. Both IL-21/IL-21R signaling and PI3K-PTEN molecules are involved in maintaining normal humoral immunity and deletion of autoreactive B cells. Since B cell overactivity is characteristic ofImmune thrombocytopenia(ITP) we sought to determine whether abnormalities in PTEN might contribute to increase B cell responsiveness in this disease. Methods: This study recruited 45 active CITP patients and 33 sex and age matched health volunteers as health controls(HC) Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from collected anti-coagulated blood. Flow cytometry and real time quantitative PCR were used for detecting the level of PTEN from PBMC cells of HC and CITP patients. Purified B cells from PBMC cells were incubated with human rIL-2 rIL-21r CD40L or anti-IgM alone or in combination for 72h and after that the PTEN level was detected by flow cytometry.The plasma cell generation via IL-21 induction were determined byflow cytometry. Results: The expression of PTEN was lower in B cell subpopulations of ITP patients compared with HCs, including IgD + CD38 int/high immature B cells, IgD + CD38 low/ \u2212 na\u00efve B cells, and IgD \u2212 CD38 int/high plasma cells (P<0.001). The levels of PTEN in CD19 + B cells from patients with active ITP tended to positively correlate with platelet count (r 2 =0.5472, P=0.0012). In patients with positive platelet-specific autoantibodies, PTEN levels were lower when compared with platelet autoantibody negative patients (717.8\u00b193.4 vs. 990.2 \u00b1 74.4. P=0.0287). After effective treatment, the expression of PTEN was increased (P=0.0011).The patients with active ITP had a significantly higher proportion of CD19 + IgD + CD38 int/hi immature B cells when compared with HCs (14.58\u00b10.89% vs . 7.21\u00b1 0.63%,P<0.0001) . Immature B cells from patients with ITP were also found to express a greater density of the activation marker CD95(P=0.0036) and lower IL-21R expression(P=0.0030) compared with HCs. We found that IL-21, CD40L, or anti-IgM resulted in enhanced PTEN expression in normal B cells. However, neither IL-21 alone, CD40L plus anti-IgM, nor the three in combination stimulated PTEN protein upregulation in B cells isolated from patients with ITP. We found that IL-21 increased the proportion of plasma cells that were CD19+CD27+CD38hi or CD138+CD38hi in PBMCs from patients with ITP, although this did not occur in cells from HCs. Summary/Conclusions: In summary, PTEN expression is lower in the B cells of patients with ITP, especially in immature B cells. The capacity of IL-21 to induce PTEN was defective in B cells isolated from patients with ITP compared with HCs. B cells from patients with active ITP tend to differentiate into plasma cells through stimulation by IL-21 alone. Our data have established the role that B cell over-activity plays during ITP and decreased expression of PTEN may contribute to B cell hyper-responsiveness and disturbed B cell homeostasis.
