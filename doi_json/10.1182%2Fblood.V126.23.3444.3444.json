    "abstract_text": "Fibrinogen binding to the integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 can mediate platelet aggregation and platelet spreading on fibrinogen-coated surfaces. However, in vivo , where blood clotting is catalyzed by thrombin, \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation and fibrinogen conversion to fibrin occur simultaneously, although the relative contributions of fibrinogen versus monomeric and polymerized fibrin to \u03b1IIb\u03b23-mediated platelet aggregation and adhesion are unknown. The interaction of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 with fibrin is responsible for clot retraction. Nonetheless, differences in the efficacy of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 antagonists with regard to clot retraction versus platelet aggregation suggest that the interaction of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 with fibrinogen and fibrin is different. Here, we have compared nanomechanical measurements of the interaction of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 with fibrin and fibrinogen to explain these differential effects. Briefly, a microscopic bead covalently coated with purified \u03b1IIb\u03b23 was captured by a focused laser beamand repeatedly brought into contact with surface-attached fibrinogen, monomeric fibrin produced by treating the immobilized fibrinogen with thrombin, or a naturally-formed hydrated fibrin fiber at the edge of a plasma clot. When an \u03b1IIb\u03b23-ligand complex was detected, the force required to dissociate the complex was measured at piconewton resolution. By analyzing the distribution of these forces, we determined the overall reactivity and the binding strength of the interacting protein pairs. Besides native fibrinogen, experiments were performed with recombinant fibrinogen variants. Rupture force histograms for \u03b1IIb\u03b23-fibrinogen interactions displayed forces ranging from 20 pN to 140 pN and could be segregated into moderate (20-60 pN) and strong (>60 pN) interactions. The inhibitory effects of EDTA and \u03b1IIb\u03b23antagonists such as abciximab and eptifibatide confirmed that fully functional \u03b1IIb\u03b23 was required to obtain these force signals. Monomeric fibrin displayed a higher cumulative probability of interacting with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and a greater binding strength. \u03b1IIb\u03b23-fibrin interactions were also less sensitive to inhibition by abciximab and eptifibatide, suggesting that they had a different binding specificity. Both fibrinogen- and fibrin- interactions with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 were partially inhibited by RGD-containing peptides, suggesting the existence of common RGD-containing binding motifs. This assumption was supported using the fibrin variants \u03b1D97E or \u03b1D574E whose mutated RGD motifs were less reactive with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 than those of wild type fibrin. Monomeric fibrin made from a homodimeric fibrinogen \u03b3 chain splice variant lacking the \u03b3C \u03b1IIb\u03b23 binding motif was more reactive with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 than the parent fibrinogen, suggesting that this binding motif is less important in fibrin. Polymeric fibrin displayed a rupture force profile similar to fibrinogen and monomeric fibrin with moderate (20-60 pN) and strong (>60 pN) forces that peaked at 70-80 pN. The \u03b1IIb\u03b23 antagonist eptifibatide, the \u03b1V\u03b23-specific cyclic RGD-containing peptide XJ735, a non-selective cyclic RGD-containing peptide, and a dodecapeptide corresponding to the C-terminus of the fibrinogen \u03b3 chain each produced a sharp drop in the medium-to-high force range. Interaction forces >60 pN were more effectively reduced by EDTA than by any of the inhibitory peptides, indicating their dependence on the structural integrity and functionality of \u03b1IIb\u03b23. The free \u03b3C dodecapeptide was also less efficient than the cRGD peptides or eptifibatide in preventing the stronger interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that surface-bound fibrinogen and monomeric, as well as polymeric fibrin, are highly reactive with the \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Fibrin is more reactive than fibrinogen in terms of its binding probability and it has greater binding strength. Fibrin binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is also less sensitive to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 inhibitors, suggesting that fibrin and fibrinogen have distinct binding requirements. In particular, the maintenance of \u03b1IIb\u03b23-binding activity when the C-terminus of the fibrinogen \u03b3 chain and the \u03b1 chain RGD sequences are mutated suggests that the \u03b1IIb\u03b23-binding sites in fibrin are not confined to its known \u03b3 chain and RGD motifs.
