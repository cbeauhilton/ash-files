    "abstract_text": "In addition to the PML-RAR\u03b1 fusion gene, which accounts for >98% of APL cases, a common segment of 5\u2032-truncated RAR\u03b1 has been found to fuse with the following 4 alternative genes: promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF-RAR\u03b1), nucleophosmin (NPM-RAR\u03b1), nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NUMA-RAR\u03b1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (STAT5b-RAR\u03b1). While recurrent cases of PLZF-RAR\u03b1 and NPM-RAR\u03b1 have been documented, there are only single case reports of NUMA-RAR\u03b1 and STAT5b-RAR\u03b1. In two Phase III clinical trials, E2491 and C9710, the ECOG registered 10 and 12 presumptive APL patients, respectively, based on initial clinical and cytological assessment, which were negative for PML-RAR\u03b1 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. In this study, we tested 20/22 of these PML-RAR\u03b1-negative protocol patients for the presence of the 4 alternative fusion genes by RT-PCR, using the corresponding normal transcripts for the rearranged genes as RNA transcription controls. All specimens were positive for the control gene, while 1 case each was positive for PLZF-RAR\u03b1 or STAT5b-RAR\u03b1. The karyotypes for these 2 cases, respectively, were 46, XY, t(11:17)(q23;q21) and 46, XY, t(10;11)(q22:q25), i(17)(q10). None of the X-RAR\u03b1-negative cases had abnormalities of chromosome 17. Immunophenotypically, the PLZF-RAR\u03b1 case was consistent with APL; the STAT5b-RAR\u03b1 case had all features of APL (negative for CD11a, CD18, CD34, HLA-DR) except for weak CD133 expression. These findings imply that it is the RAR\u03b1 rearrangement that prompts the APL immunophenotype. Sequence analysis of the STAT5b-RAR\u03b1 mRNA disclosed the same break/fusion point of the STAT5b gene as the only previously-reported case of STAT5b-RAR\u03b1-positive APL ( Arnould, et al, Hum Mol Genet  8 , 1741 , 1999 ). Also like the first case (67 years), our STAT5b-RAR\u03b1 patient was an elderly male (57 years). These results suggest that X-RAR\u03b1 fusion genes will rarely be found in the absence of cytogenetic evidence of chromosome 17 abnormalities and establish that STAT5b-RAR\u03b1, although rare, is a recurrent pathogenetic factor in APL."
