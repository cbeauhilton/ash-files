    "abstract_text": "Background: Patients with CTLC usually have a poor immune response. CD8+CD28\u2212 T cells are new types of immune suppressor cells. The study was to analyze the level and changes of them in peripheral blood with CTLC, their effects on immunosupression of CTLC, the influence factors to provide reference for treatment of CTLC patients. Patients and Methods: 27 patients with CTLC were enrolled in the study: 8 women and 19 men aged 35\u201381, medium 57. According to Ann Arbor classification stage I was represented by 1 patient, stage II -6 patients, stage III - 5 patients, stage IV - 6 patients and stage early stage (premycoticus) was represented by 8 patients. Peripheral blood samples were assessed from all patients with CTLC before treatment and 8 normals. Percentage CD8+CD28\u2212 T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Result: Compared with control group percentage of CD8+CD28\u2212 T cells was significantly higher in patients group p=0,005 (test U Mann Whitney). There were no significant differences of T-cells in among patients with different clinical stages. We revealed the correlation between CD8+CD28\u2212 cells and advanced clinical stage r=0,54, p=0,035 (Spearman correlation test). Conclusion: Percentage of CD8+CD28\u2212 T cells is increased in peripheral blood in CTLC patients, and correlates with advanced stage.",
