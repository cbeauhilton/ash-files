    "abstract_text": "Background: Nonpuerperal ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is a rare clinical entity. Therapy is not well defined. OVT is usually asymptomatic. Improved CT and MR imaging technology enables OVT to be diagnosed with greater frequency. Nonpuerperal OVT may be a distinct clinical entity. Methods: The medical records of women with nonpuerperal OVT were reviewed and their clinical course and treatment recorded. Cases were identified by scanning a CT computerized database over the past 3 years with the key words ovarian vein thrombosis. Results : 7 patients (pts) were identified. Age range was 38\u201361, median 51 years. 3 pts had OVT on the left and 4 on the right. OVT followed a procedure in 2 pts. 2 pts with breast cancer developed OVT, 1 during adjuvant tamoxifen and 1 receiving chemotherapy for metastatic disease. 1 pt had AML in CR. 3 pts presented with lower abdominal pain on the involved side and 1 pt had lower abdominal pain on the opposite side. The 3 pts with cancer were asymptomatic. 4 pts had uterine fibroids. 1 developed OVT in the setting of an acute diarrheal illness. 1 pt had prior DVT and 1 a family history of DVT. Only 1 pt had a hypercoagulable evaluation; negative. 2 pts had clot extending to the junction with the inferior vena cava (IVC) and both were anticoagulated with enoxaparin followed by warfarin. 1 pt was anticoagulated with enoxaparin alone. No embolic complications occurred. Conclusion : 4 pts with OVT were symptomatic and 3 were detected incidentally. 2 developed OVT following procedures, 3 had predisposing underlying conditions, and 2 had a personal or family history of thrombosis. Optimum therapy is not defined. Symptomatic disease alone is not an indication for anticoagulation. Anticoagulation may be indicated if clot extends to the IVC."
