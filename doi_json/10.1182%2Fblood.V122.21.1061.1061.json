    "abstract_text": "Background Glycoprotein (GP) Ib\u03b1 contains binding sites for von Willebrand factor (VWF), \u03b1-thrombin, P-selectin, and Mac-1 at the extracellular N-terminal 282 residues. Particularly, the interaction of GPIb\u03b1 with VWF exposed at the injured vessel wall initiates platelet adhesion, and simultaneously triggers intracellular signaling leading to integrin activation and platelet thrombus formation. Therefore, GPIb\u03b1 ectodomain shedding, which down-regulates the surface expression of the functional receptor and results in the generation of glycocalicin (GC), a soluble N-terminal fragment of GPIb\u03b1, has important implications for thrombosis and hemostasis. Stimulations of platelet with either physiological or chemical compounds result in GPIb\u03b1 ectodomain shedding in vitro and in vivo. The generation of ROS has been observed in platelets stimulated with physiological or chemical compounds, such as collagen, thrombin, and thromboxane A2 analog U46619. In this paper, we plan to clarify the relationship between physiological stimulation-induced ROS generation and GPIb\u03b1 shedding and the regulatory mechanism of ADAM17-mediated GPIb\u03b1 shedding. Methods Washed platelets (3\u00d710 8 /ml) were pre-incubated with or without N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (10 mM), dithiothreitol (DTT) (3 mM), or vehicle control (DMSO) at RT for 15 minutes, and then were incubated with A23187 (5 \u03bcM), thrombin (1 U/ml), collagen (5 ug/ml), or dibucaine (1 mM) at 37 \u00b0C (or at RT for dibucaine) for different time. Western blot and flow cytometry was used to evaluate the GPIb\u03b1 ectodomain shedding. ROS levels in platelets were examined using ROS assay kit according to the manufacture\u2019s instruction. Results and conclusions Collagen, thrombin, and calcium ionophore A23187 induced ROS generation, and simultaneously incurred GPIb\u03b1 ectodomain shedding. ROS scavengers NAC and DTT abolished not only collagen, thrombin, and A23187 induced ROS production, but also GPIb\u03b1 ectodomain shedding. Interestingly, a recognized calpain activator, dibucaine, induced both ROS production and GPIb\u03b1 shedding, which were also obviously reduced by NAC and DTT. Furthermore, calpain inhibitors calpain inhibitor I and carbobenzoxy-valinyl-phenylalaninal (MDL), obviously reduced dibucaine-induced ROS production, and inhibited ROS generations induced by A23187 and thrombin. These data indicate that ROS, regulated by calpain, plays a key role in collagen, thrombin, and A23187 induced GPIb\u03b1 ectodomain shedding. These findings will help to understand the negative-regulatory mechanisms of platelet function, and may suggest a novel strategy to design new class of anti-platelet drug.
