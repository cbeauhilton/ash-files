    "abstract_text": "Patients with \u03b2-thalassemia show an abnormally high proportion of red blood cells (RBCs) with exposed phosphatidyl serine (PS) molecules on the RBC membrane, which may contribute to thrombophilia in these patients ( 1 ). We have reported previously ( 2 ) that thromboxane A 2 and free-arachidonate\u2014substances released from activated platelets\u2014induce PS exposure in a subpopulation of normal RBCs. The aims of the present study were first, to evaluate the presence of activated circulating platelets in patients with \u03b2-thalassemia, and second, to determine tissue factor (TF)-initiated thrombin generation in plasma and the influence of RBCs, platelets and their cooperation on this process in normal subjects and patients with \u03b2-thalassemia. Thrombin generation was assessed according to Hemker et al. ( 3 ) in 12 patients with \u03b2-thalassemia diagnosed by molecular biology, age 5\u201333 years and in 18 normal subjects. Two patients had thalassemia major (T-M) requiring blood transfusion every 3 weeks and the analysis were performed just prior transfusion. Two had thalassemia intermedia (T-I) with esplenectomy without transfusion requirements and eight had thalassemia minor (T-m). Thrombin generation was evaluated in platelet-poor plasma (PP), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), RBCs in the plasma (P-RBC) and in the presence of both cell types (PRP+RBC). The presence of activated platelets in circulation was evaluated in whole blood by flow cytometry. We monitored P-selectin (CD-62) and the activated \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 receptor, defined as PAC-1 binding. The percentage of platelets exposing activation markers CD-62 (mean\u00b1 SEM, 0.72\u00b1 0.17 vs. 4.03\u00b1 1.39) and PAC-1(0.75\u00b1 0.14 vs. 12.26\u00b1 6.47) were significantly higher in patients than in control subjects ( P < 0.05). In normal subjects, the presence of erythrocytes in plasma (P-RBC) triggered a quicker thrombin generation and a significant elevation in the thrombin peak (32 \u00b1 5 nM in PP vs. 86 \u00b1 16 nM in P-RBC; P < 0.05), in the absence of cell lysis. These effects of RBCs were markedly higher in the patients with \u03b2-thalassemia, who had 2.5-fold higher thrombin generation at 3 min and higher peak thrombin levels (86 \u00b1 16 nM in controls vs. 130 \u00b1 15 nM in patients; P < 0.05). Thrombin generation in PRP was also higher in the patients with thalassemia at early times (3 min; 19 \u00b1 3 nM in controls vs. 43 \u00b1 8 nM in patients; P < 0.05). Importantly, the rate and peak of thrombin generation were significantly amplified by the presence of both cell types (PRP+RBCs), suggesting a biochemical cooperation between activated platelets and RBCs for thrombin generation. This was enhanced in patients with \u03b2-thalassemia, particularly those with T-I. In conclusion, chronic platelet activation in patients with \u03b2-thalassemia may influence TF-induced thrombin generation in platelets and erythrocytes. Thrombin generation appears to be a novel mode of platelet-erythrocyte cooperation in thrombogenesis.",
