    "abstract_text": "Background . Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy of childhood and a major cause of childhood cancer-related mortality. Although the cure rate now approaches 90%, certain pediatric ALL subgroups present subsequent relapse. For this reason, analyses of cell signaling pathways will help to identify new markers and/or targets for tailored therapy. PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation is frequently found in both B-ALL and T-ALL. Protein kinase Ck 2 ( CSNK 2) activity in pediatric ALL was increased and its inhibition restored PTEN phosphatase activity with subsequent inactivation of AKT. Moreover, Ck 2 may serve the activity of oncogenes such as BCR-ABL and c-MYC , control the activation of other critical signaling cascades (JAK-STAT), and sustain multiple cellular stress-elicited pathway such as the proteotoxic stress, unfolded protein and DNA-damage responses. Ck 2 has also been shown to have an essential role in tuning signals derived from the stromal tumor microenvironment (Piazza F et al, Oncogene 2016). Material and Methods . We analyzed cDNA collected from 46 patients with B-ALL [19 High Risk (HR) for Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) and 27 NON-HR] and 25 with T-ALL (8 HR and 17 NON-HR), respectively, diagnosed in our Center from 2000 to 2012. The latter subgroup was screened fro PTEN-Exon 7 mutations and TXL 3 rearrangements. We evaluated the gene expression of Ck 2 and c-Myc genes using RQ-PCR with Sybr-Green and a relative quantification method (\u0394\u0394Ct method), comparing gene's expression from patients with samples from 6 healty donors (HDs). In order to demonstrate the correlation between genetic alteration and signaling transduction, specifically in HR patients , we analyzed some phosphoproteins by Phospho-flow approach. We profiled 5 proteins (STAT3, STAT5, CREB, PTEN and pS6) in 4 T-ALL cases (3 with PTEN-Exon 7 mutation). Results . We observed a significant difference of Ck 2 expression in T-ALL NON-HR patients vs HDs (Mean Ck 2 Fold-Changes 3.494 vs 1.17, p=0.0315) and in T-ALL HR patients (6.384 vs 1.17, p=0.0219) vs HDs (Fig 1A and B). Comparing NON-HR vs HR cases, we found a statistically significant difference (p<0.0001) (Fig 1C). c-Myc mean expression was very similar between the two T-ALL subgroups. Moreover, among T-ALL cases, we identified 5 patients with PTEN- Exon7 mutations and 6 with TLX3 rearrangements. We observed that cases with PTEN- Exon7 mutation showed lower c-Myc expression than cases with PTEN- Exon7 wild-type (mean c-Myc 8.550 vs 1.920) whereas patients with TLX3 rearrangements showed higher c-Myc expression than TLX3 negative (mean c-Myc 18.260 vs 5.502) (p<0.005) (Fig 2A and B). We did not observe any correlation between these rearrangements and Ck 2 expression. We also performed Ck 2 and c-Myc expression analysis in B-ALL (NON-HR and HR) subgroups. We surprisingly observed a Ck 2 overexpression in both NON-HR and HR B-ALLs compared to HDs. On the other side, we did not observed significant difference about c-Myc expression in cases with B-ALL vs HDs; whilst we observed an overexpression of c-Myc in HR vs NON-HR patients with B-ALL (mean 7.075 vs 2.095, respectively)(p<0.0004). Phospho-Flow analysis, in 3 cases with PTEN- Exon7 mutation (1 Ck2+/normal Myc, 1 normal Ck2/normal Myc, 1 Ck2-/normal Myc) showed PTEN null, very lower pS6 basal level and higher CREB basal level than in case with PTEN- Exon7 wild-type. Moreover, we observed that the latter patient, presented with a TLX3 rearrangements ( Ck 2+/ Myc +) with higher c-Myc expression, showed higher STAT3 basal state level confirming that STAT3 induces the expression of c-Myc. Conclusions . Based on our preliminary findings, Ck 2 could be considered as a marker and /or a potential candidate for targeted therapy, specifically in HR-ALL, as confirmed by the use of CK2 inhibitor (CX-4945) in ongoing clinical trials. c-Myc overexpression confirmed its association with HR features. The potential role as markers of both genes needs to be demonstrated in a larger population study. Combined application of genomic and phosphoproteomic strategies will lead us to better profile diagnostic samples of HR-ALL, addressing future tailored treatments.
