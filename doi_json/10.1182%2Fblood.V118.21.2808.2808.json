    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2808 T cell clonality is a common finding in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), but is believed to be a reactive phenomenon. We compared copy number abnormalities in matched CD34 + progenitor cells and CD3 + T cells from 40 MDS patients by array comparative genomic hybridization. In 9 of 14 patients with large copy number variants, we detected the same aberration in CD34 + and CD3 + cells. Chromosome 20q (2 patients), isodicentric \u00d7 chromosome (2 patients), trisomy 8 (2 patients), 11q abnormalities (1 patient), deletion 5q (1 patient) and partial trisomy 9 with trisomies 19 and 22 (1 patient) were detected in the CD34 + and CD3 + cells of these patients. The presence of deletion 20q, trisomy 8 and deletion of chromosome arm 11q in the T cells of 3 patients was confirmed by FISH. Multiplex PCR for TCR \u03b3 rearrangement was performed on 6 of the 14 MDS patients with large copy number variants. T cell clonality was detected in 3 of 4 and oligoclonality in 1 of 4 patients when the copy number variant was present in both CD34 + and CD3 + cells. In contrast, the 2 cases lacking the CD34 + copy number variant in the CD3 + population were polyclonal at the TCR \u03b3 locus. These data suggest that in a large proportion of MDS at least a proportion of the T cells are part of the malignant clone, and that CD3 + cells do not represent an appropriate patient normal control for genome-wide studies.
