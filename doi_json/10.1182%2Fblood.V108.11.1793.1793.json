    "abstract_text": "Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is a critical component of intracellular signaling cascades as well as actin dynamics. It is synthesized by the phosphorylation of PI4P by one of three isoforms of PIP5KI (\u03b1,\u03b2, or \u03b3). We found that the targeted disruption of PIP5KI\u03b3 results in early prenatal mortality that prevented studies of bone marrow or liver hematopoietic cells. However, we were able to analyze yolk sac progenitor cells differentiated ex vivo into megakaryocytes. Imaging in the electron microscope showed that PIP5KI\u03b3-null megakaryocytes have normal architectural appearance of their microtubules, and formed proplatelets and platelets. This demonstrates that PIP5KI\u03b3 is not essential for the development of megakaryocytes, proplatelets, or platelets. PIP5KI\u03b3 knockout megakaryocytes had normal basal levels of PIP2, but decreased synthesis following stimulation with thrombin. Using spinning disk video confocal microscopy, we found that wild type megakaryocytes actively formed and contracted lamellipodia, and rapidly spread upon a fibrinogen matrix. In contrast, PIP5KI\u03b3-null megakaryocytes continuously and slowly extended and retracted membrane blebs, rather than lamellipodia. We analyzed whether PIP5KI\u03b3-null megakaryocytes have a defect in their ability to anchor their membranes to the cytoskeleton accounting for the blebbing phenotype by using laser tweezers to pull the cell membrane apart from the cytoskeleton. Fibrinogen-coated beads bound both wild type and PIP5KI\u03b3-null megakaryocytes. Yet wild type cells had rigid membranes that resisted stretching by trapped beads that were pulled by laser tweezers. In contrast, the majority of PIP5KI\u03b3-null megakaryocytes had flexible membranes that were easily stretched by pulling on the fibrinogen-coated beads, and ultimately allowed membrane tethers to form. We found that the membrane phenotype was completely reverted by adding back wild type PIP5KI\u03b3, but not by a catalytically inactive PIP5KI\u03b3 mutant. This shows that the lipid kinase activity of PIP5KI\u03b3 regulates the membrane phenotype. Surprisingly, PIP5KI\u03b2-null megakaryocytes have at least as great of a defect in PIP2 synthesis but lack this membrane abnormality. Furthermore, overexpression of PIP5KI\u03b2 in PIP5KI\u03b3-null megakaryocytes fails to rescue the cytoskeletal defect. Adding back a splice variant of PIP5KI\u03b3 that lacks the binding site for talin, also fails to revert this cytoskeletal defect present in PIP5KI\u03b3-null cells. This suggests that talin binding and PIP2 synthesized specifically by the PIP5KI\u03b3 isoform are required for the cytoskeletal organization of megakaryocytes. Given the proposed role of PIP2 on the regulation of the demarcation membrane system (DMS), we expressed GFP-fused to \u03b23-integrin and followed its trafficking from the DMS to the surface membrane. GFP-\u03b23 situated on the DMS externalized to the cellular membrane within minutes of plating a wild type megakaryocyte upon immobilized fibrinogen. In megakaryocytes lacking PIP5KI\u03b3, GFP-\u03b23 situated on the DMS poorly externalized, and was barely detectable on the cell membrane 1 hour after adhering to immobilized fibrinogen. This shows that trafficking of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 from the DMS to the cell membrane requires PIP5KI\u03b3. Together, this demonstrates that spatially restricted production of PIP2 by PIP5KI\u03b3 is required to preserve the integrity of the membrane cytoskeleton, and that PIP2 synthesized by PIP5KI\u03b2 in megakaryocytes can not contribute to this process.",
