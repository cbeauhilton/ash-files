    "abstract_text": "Chromosomal rearrangements of the MLL gene are responsible for 5\u201310% of all acute leukemias, biphenotypic leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes. 5\u201310% of these MLL aberrations are therapy-related leukemias with the frequent fusion partners ELL, MLLT3, MLLT10 and MLLT2. The large number of known and unknown MLL fusions (>80) renders a precise diagnosis a demanding task. Even though all MLL rearrangements are associated with high risk acute leukemias, the outcome (favorable or poor) depends on the partner gene. Thus, the identification of MLL gene fusions is necessary for rapid clinical de-ci-sions resulting in specific therapy regimens. After their cytogenetic identification, only the most common MLL fusions MLLT2, MLLT3, MLLT1, MLLT4, ELL and MLLT10 (80%) are investigated by RT-PCR analysis, whereas infrequent or unknown MLL rearrangements (20%) are more or less excluded from further analysis. Therefore we established a LDI-PCR (long-distance inverse PCR) based method that uses small amounts of genomic DNA to determine any type of MLL associated chromosomal abnormality. With this diagnostic tool more than 400 prescreened und unscreened adult and pediatric samples (AML/ALL) from different European diagnostic centers have been analyzed. During this study more than 200 MLL rearrangements were characterized for their precise localization of genomic break-points. The identified MLL rearrangements consist of 25 different fusion genes including the following eight novel MLL partner genes: ACACA, ARGHEF17, BCL9L, MAML2, SELB, SMAP1, and TIRAP. The identified MLL aberrations are basically reciprocal translocations, but also deletions, inversions, insertions and interstitial duplications have been determined. Combining the data of our study and data retrieved from the literature, a total of 88 partner genes can now be annotated. 52 fusion partners (60%) have been characterized on the molecular level whereas at least 36 (40%) remain to be identified. These results demonstrate that this new diagnostic tool in combination with split-signal FISH is qualified for the rapid analysis of known as well as unknown MLL partner genes. Furthermore, the determined patient specific fusion sequences are useful for minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring of MLL associated acute leukemias. The use of these MRD markers will contribute to improve the treatment and outcome of acute leukemia patients. A first prospective study was already initiated by the German ALL study group and verified the reliability of these genomic markers for MRD monitoring.",
