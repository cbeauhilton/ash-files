    "abstract_text": "Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces rapid thrombocytopenia, hypotension and sepsis. Although growing evidence suggests that platelet activation plays a critical role in LPS-induced thrombocytopenia and tissue damage, the mechanism of LPS-mediated platelet activation is unclear. Here we show that LPS stimulated platelet secretion of dense and alpha granules as indicated by ATP release and P-selectin expression, and thus enhanced platelet activation induced by low concentrations of platelet agonists. Platelets express components of the LPS receptor-signaling complex, including Toll-like receptor (TLR4), CD14, MD2, and MyD88. The effect of LPS on platelet activation was abolished by an anti-TLR4 blocking antibody or TLR4 knockout. Furthermore, LPS-induced potentiation of platelet aggregation and FeCl3-induced thrombus formation were abolished in MyD88 knockout mice. Importantly, TLR4 mediates LPS-induced cGMP elevation and the stimulatory effect of LPS on platelet aggregation was also abolished by inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). Thus, LPS promotes platelet secretion and aggregation through a TLR4/MyD88 and cGMP/PKG-dependent pathway."
