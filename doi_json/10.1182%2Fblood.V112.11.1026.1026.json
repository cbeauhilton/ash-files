    "abstract_text": "TFPI is an endothelium associated anticoagulant protein that directly inhibits tissue factor (TF) pro-coagulant activity and prevents disease produced by intravascular thrombosis. TFPI is produced in three alternatively spliced isoforms in mice, \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3, that differ in domain structure and mechanism for association with endothelium. TFPI\u03b1 has three Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitory domains and a basic C-terminal region. It produces anticoagulant activity by direct inhibition of factor Xa (fXa) via the second Kunitz domain (K2) and, in a fXa dependent manner, inhibition of TF-fVIIa via the first Kunitz domain (K1). The third Kunitz domain (K3) and C-terminal region do not directly inhibit proteolysis. However, alignment of sequences from various vertebrate species demonstrates that K3 has maintained a high degree of sequence conservation for over 430 million years suggesting that K3 maintains a physiological function. TFPI\u03b1 indirectly associates with endothelium by binding to a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchored protein and binds non-specifically to glycosaminoglycans. TFPI\u03b2 has K1 and K2 but lacks K3 and has a distinct C-terminal region that encodes a GPI-anchor attachment sequence. TFPI\u03b3 has K1 and K2 but lacks K3 and has a distinct C-terminal region that results in production of a secreted protein. It is not known if these structurally diverse forms of TFPI with different mechanisms for cell surface association have variable efficacy in their ability to inhibit TF activity in vivo . We characterized TFPI isoform expression in mouse tissues in order to define specific physiological functions for alternative splicing of TFPI and how it may hinder diseases mediated by intravascular TF activity. Message for TFPI\u03b1 is ~16-fold more abundant than message for TFPI\u03b2 or TFPI\u03b3 in mouse tissues. In situ hybridization studies of mouse heart and lung found that the isoforms are expressed in the same pattern, primarily in endothelial cells. No cell or vascular bed exclusively producing a single isoform was identified. Western blot analyses revealed the somewhat surprising finding that TFPI\u03b2 is the predominant isoform produced by adult mouse tissues. Thus, protein synthesis of TFPI isoforms in mice is regulated at least in part at the level of protein translation. Mouse plasma TFPI levels increase only 10\u201320% following heparin infusion. These data contrast with the 2- to 4-fold increase in plasma TFPI observed following heparin infusion in humans. The presence of only small amounts of heparin releasable TFPI in mouse plasma is consistent with TFPI\u03b2 as the major isoform because TFPI\u03b2 is directly GPI-anchored to endothelium and lacks the highly basic C-terminal region that allows TFPI\u03b1 to associate non-specifically with endothelium glycosaminoglycans. To our knowledge, these are the first data demonstrating TFPI\u03b2 production in vivo . In contrast to the adult tissues, western blot analysis of mouse placenta revealed that it produces primarily TFPI\u03b1. This finding led us to examine mouse fetal tissue to determine if there is developmental regulation of the production of different TFPI isoforms. These studies demonstrated that TFPI\u03b1 and TFPI\u03b2 are produced in approximately equal amounts in E14.5 embryos. The relative proportion of TFPI\u03b1 in mouse tissues then decreases during development and very little is produced at 12 weeks of age. The evolutionary conservation of TFPI\u03b1 and its production in mouse placenta and embryonic tissues suggests that unique features of TFPI\u03b1, such as K3, the basic C-terminal region and/or its binding to the endothelial surface through a GPI-anchored co-receptor, perform specific functions in the regulation of intravascular TF activity during vasculogenesis/angiogenesis that are not performed by TFPI\u03b2 or TFPI\u03b3."
