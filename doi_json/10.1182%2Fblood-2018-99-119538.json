    "abstract_text": "Loss-of-function mutations in KDM6A , an X-linked H3K27 demethylase, occur recurrently in B-cell lymphoid malignancies, including B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Germline inactivating mutations in KDM6A cause a neurodevelopmental disorder called Kabuki syndrome that is associated with recurrent infections and hypogammaglobulinemia. 1 The role of KDM6A in normal B-cell development and function, as well as how the somatic loss of KDM6A contributes to B-cell malignancies, has not been completely defined. To address this issue, we generated a conditional knockout mouse of the KDM6A gene (with LoxP sites flanking the 3rd exon) and crossed these mice with Vav1-Cre transgenic mice to selectively inactivate KDM6A in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. We characterized normal hematopoiesis from young (6 to 8 week old) and aged (50 to 55 week old) male and female KDM6A conditional KO mice. We found a significant shift from lymphoid to myeloid differentiation in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of these mice. Young, female KDM6A -null mice had mild splenomegaly. Their spleens had an increased number of neutrophils (Gr-1 + CD11b + cells) and erythrocyte progenitors (CD71 + Ter119 + cells) and a decreased number of B-cells (B220 + cells). These changes became more pronounced with age and were specific to the female, homozygous KDM6A knockout mice. Furthermore, analysis of B-cell maturation showed that the loss of KDM6A was associated with decreased immature (B220 + IgM + cells) and mature, resting B-cells (B220 + IgD + cells) in the spleen. Similar changes were present in the bone marrow (decreased B220 + IgM + cells and B220 + CD19 + cells) and peripheral blood (decreased B220 + IgM + , B220 + IgD + and B220 + CD19 + cells). Early B-cell development is also altered in KDM6A -null mice. Flow cytometry showed a decrease in multipotent progenitor cells (MPPs) with a decrease in both common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) and B cell-biased lymphoid progenitors (BLPs) in young, female KDM6A -null mice bone marrow. Next, we performed flow cytometry to catergorize the Hardy fractions of early B-cell development on bone marrow isolated from young, female KDM6A -null mice. B-cell progenitor analysis (Hardy profiles) showed an increase in Fraction A with a concomitant decrease in Fraction B/C and Fraction D, which was likely indicative of an incomplete block in B-cell differentiation after the Fraction A stage. When bulk bone marrow cells isolated from young, female KDM6A -null mice were plated in methylcellulose supplemented with interleukin-7, we observed a significantly decreased colony formation compared with bone marrow cells isolated from wildtype littermates. This pre-B lymphoid progenitor cell plating phenotype was expected given the flow cytometry results of decreased B-cell progenitors outlined above. We examined the effect of the loss of KDM6A expression on germinal center (GC) formation in the spleen following immunization with NP-CGG (4-Hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl-Chicken Gamma Globulin, Ratio 16). Two weeks after NP-CGG immunization, we observed a significant decrease in follicular B-cells (FO) and a significant increase in GC B-cells as compared to wildtype littermates ( Figure 1 ). The result is significant as GC B-cells are thought to be the cell-of-origin of follicular and DLBCL. To determine if inactivation of KDM6A affected antibody production, we measured IgM, IgG, IgE and IgA levels by ELISA from serum isolated from young, female KDM6A -null mice. Results revealed higher levels of IgM and lower levels of IgG in serum from KDM6A -null mice, which is suggestive of a class switch recombination (CSR) defect. Concordant with this result, we observed that the loss of KDM6A impaired CSR to IgG1 in splenic B cells after in vitro stimulation for three days with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an anti-CD180 antibody and interleukin-4. Moreover, we observed a striking defect in the production of plasma cells from KDM6A -null B-cells after LPS stimulation. Taken together, our data shows that KDM6A plays an important, but complex, role in B-cell development and that loss of KDM6A impedes the B-cell immune response in a specific manner that may contribute to infection and B-cell malignancies.
