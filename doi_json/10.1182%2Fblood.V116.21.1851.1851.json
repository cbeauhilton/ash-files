Few kinase hits were identified. Therefore we asked if phosphatases might be involved in modulating epigenetic therapies. Thus in order to identify potentiators of the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) we performed high-throughput RNA-interference (RNAi) lethality screening using the myeloid cell lines HEL, THP-1 and TF-1 in combination with SAHA. Methods: A small-interfering RNA (siRNA) library targeting 206 phosphatases with 4 sequences per target gene was used for this study. siRNA were transfected in a single-siRNA-per-well format in 384-well plates using commercial lipid-based transfection reagents. Non-silencing siRNA were included as negative controls to access non-specific siRNA toxicity and universal lethal siRNA were included as positive controls to indirectly assess functional transfection efficiency. After a 96 hour incubation period, cell viability/proliferation was measured with Cell Titer Glo. For analysis of screen data, log2 values of (SAHA + siRNA treatment/siRNA treatment only) were calculated. Potentiation was defined as two standard deviations from the median log2 ratio of all siRNA (excluding positive controls) on a plate-by-plate basis. Hits were defined as \u2265 2/4 siRNA sequences meeting potentiation criteria. Results: Transfection efficiency was 95, 90 and 70% for HEL, THP-1 and TF-1, respectively. All three cell lines were similarly sensitive to SAHA with IC 50 values of 0.3, 0.4 and 0.6 \u03bcM for HEL, THP-1 and TF-1, respectively. Resulting SAHA concentrations for screens were between the IC 5 to IC 30 . For THP-1, 5 phosphatases qualified according to the hit selection criteria applied indicating strong potentiation to SAHA. Of these 5 hits, 3 did not exhibit strong reductions in viability with siRNA alone, suggesting a SAHA-dependent relationship. For HEL and TF-1, although no phosphatases met the strict selection cutoff, there were several phosphatases exhibiting potentiation, suggesting biological relevance. The primary screening data and preliminary analysis will be validated with rigorous secondary experimentation and top hits for all cell lines will be investigated and advanced. Conclusions: While there are numerous kinase inhibitors in the clinic and in preclinical development, phosphatases are much less explored as therapeutic targets. Validated potentiating targets from this RNAi screen can facilitate the development of rational SAHA combination therapies. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
