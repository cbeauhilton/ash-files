    "abstract_text": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated signaling has at least two potential roles in diffuse large B cell lymphoma: potentiation of angiogenesis, and potentiation of proliferation and/or survival induced by autocrine VEGF receptor-mediated signaling by lymphoma cells. We have recently shown that diffuse large B cell lymphomas expressing high levels of VEGF protein also express high levels of VEGF receptors 1 and 2. We have now assessed a larger multi-institutional cohort of patients with de novo diffuse large B cell lymphoma treated with anthracycline-based therapy to address whether either tumor vascularity as assessed by microvessel density counting, or expression of VEGF protein and its receptors as assessed by immunohistochemistry, contribute to patient outcomes. Increased tumor vascularity (Figure 1a, b, c -- increasing microvessel density) is associated with poor overall survival (p=0.047), and is independent of the international prognostic index (Figure 1d). In contrast, high expression of VEGFR1 by lymphoma cells is associated with improved overall survival (p=0.044) and a trend toward improved progression-free survival (p=0.054). High expression of VEGF by lymphoma cells is also associated with a trend toward improved overall survival (p=0.089). The concordant trend toward improved survival with increased lymphoma cell expression of VEGF and its receptor VEGFR1, together with their coordinate overexpression in a subset of diffuse large B cell lymphomas (p=0.00025, chi value 21.5), suggests the presence of an autocrine VEGF-VEGFR1-mediated feedback loop in these lymphomas. Indeed the combination of high VEGF and VEGFR1 protein expression identifies a subgroup of patients with improved overall (p=0.003) and progression-free (p=0.026) survival; these findings are independent of the international prognostic index (Figure 2). The presence of improved survival in a cohort of patients whose lymphomas potentially depend on autocrine signaling via VEGFR1 suggests that dependence on this pathway may render patients susceptible to the effects of anthracycline-based therapy; indeed, downregulation of VEGF expression at the mRNA level by anthracyclines and other chemotherapeutic agents has been demonstrated in a variety of non-hematolymphoid neoplasms. The relative importance of autocrine VEGF-mediated signaling versus vascularity should certainly be taken into account in clinical trials of anti-VEGF/VEGF receptor therapy in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
