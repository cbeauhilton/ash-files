    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3606 Background: Cytogenetic abnormalities are important prognostic indicators in CLL. At Mayo Clinic, CLL FISH analyses are derived from buffy coat samples not purified for lymphocytes. Scoring is therefore performed on consecutive qualifying nuclei regardless of cell size, shape or morphology. This scoring may not reflect the percent of abnormal nuclei of the affected cell type, but rather the entire population of cells present in the sample. We sought to determine whether the percent abnormal nuclei in only the affected cell type (e.g. lymphocytes) of patients with CLL differed from that of the general cell population. Scoring only B-lymphocytes could increase the sensitivity of the test in patients with low B-cell counts, either early in their disease or after treatment. Cell sorting techniques could be used to reach this goal but can be expensive, labor intensive and add to completion time. We propose a \u201cPoor Man's Cell Sorting\u201d technique based on cell morphology when stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). In CLL samples, both round and so called \u201clobed\u201d cells are seen by DAPI staining but we hypothesize that the CLL B-cells typically present as perfectly round in shape ( Fig. 1 ). Thus our hypothesis: if only the round cells are scored for a genetic defect, would this more accurately represent the malignant leukemic B-cell population and allow for enhanced disease status by FISH? Figure 1 View large Download slide Round Cell with FISH Detectable 13q- vs Lobed Cells without FISH Detectable Defect Figure 1 View large Download slide Round Cell with FISH Detectable 13q- vs Lobed Cells without FISH Detectable Defect  Methods: After IRB approval, we identified 87 CLL patients (75% male; 25% female, mean age 62.4 y, range 43\u201389 y) in the Mayo Clinic CLL Database, who were seen at Mayo Clinic between March, 2002 - July, 2010. We selected patients known to have low level FISH abnormalities and who therefore should have a significant population of both lymphocytes and neutrophils. Selection criteria included <20\u00d710 6 B-cells per microliter (by flow cytometry) of peripheral blood and \u226440% of interphase nuclei expressing a specific FISH abnormality. Although most of the 87 patients exhibited more than one FISH abnormality, we focused on only one FISH defect per patient for this study. The original specimen (slide or fixed cell pellet) was rescored for % abnormal nuclei among 100 consecutive round and 100 consecutive lobed (or multilobular) nuclei, using DAPI to identify nuclear architecture. These scores were compared to each other and to the original clinical FISH analysis (scored for 200 consecutive nuclei and not selected for nuclear morphology). Results: Among 87 cases, FISH signals were scored for 6q-(1), 11q-(9), +12(15), 13q-(58), 17p-(2) and 2 IGH rearrangements. In 86/87 cases, the abnormal lobed nuclei did not have FISH defects. One patient exhibited 35% +12 by clinical assay, 52% +12 in the round nuclei, and 11% by lobed nuclei. For all cases, the mean percentage of abnormal nuclei was greater in the round cells (46%) vs original scoring (23.6%). In 79/87 patients (91%), the % of abnormal nuclei was greater in the round cells vs original FISH (mean increase 24.3%; range 1.5\u201357%). One patient's score was the same in round cells vs original, and 7 patients exhibited fewer abnormal nuclei in the round cells vs original. For these 7 cases, the mean % abnormal nuclei was 5.6% for round nuclei vs 8.4% for original score (score differences ranged from 1 \u2013 5.5%). Overall, by univariate regression analysis, round cells (p=0.0043) have a better correlation with % B-cells, ascertained by flow cytometry, than either the current clinical approach (p=0.0462) or the lobed-cell approach (p=0.4058). Discussion: In virtually all cases (99%), the abnormal FISH patterns were confined to the round nuclei, and the lobed nuclei were virtually always normal by FISH. For patients with <20\u00d710 6 lymphocytes, selecting for round nuclei uniformly resulted in identification of a higher percentage of abnormal cells. Further studies, including comparison of our round nucleus approach to CLL FISH analysis to actual sorted B-lymphocyte cell selection and the association of this leukemic restricted estimation of abnormal FISH levels to clinical outcome are necessary. Given our findings, we believe that estimating FISH defects restricted to the leukemic B-cell population will become an important adjunct to cytogenetic analysis for patients with low lymphocyte counts, including those in clinical remission and those with minimal residual disease.
