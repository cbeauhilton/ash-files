    "abstract_text": "Abstract 42 Although BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized treatment of CML, they do not eradicate disease and treatment resistance can emerge. We recently identified Placental Growth Factor (PlGF) as an additional pathogenic factor in murine BCR-ABL1+ leukemia. PlGF induces proliferation of bone marrow stromal cells and of BCR-ABL1+ cell lines. PlGF is upregulated in blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) of mice with BCR-ABL1+ leukemia and it's inhibition by a monoclonal antibody (\u03b1PlGF) significantly prolongs survival of mice bearing BCR-ABL1-unmutated and -T315I mutant blast crisis (BC) CML (Loges et al., Blood 2008; 112: abstract 1094). Now, we have further characterized the role of PlGF in disease progression, the mechanism of action of \u03b1PlGF and validated PlGF as novel target in human CML. We first quantified PB and BM PlGF protein levels at different time points after inoculation of BCR-ABL1 transduced BM cells and found significantly increasing PlGF levels upon disease progression. In line with those data, PB and BM PlGF protein levels correlated with numbers of GFP-marked leukemia cells (r=0.81; p=7-fold more PlGF than leukemia cells (p=0.003), which corroborates our preclinical data and extends the concept that PlGF is primarily produced by stromal cells in CML patients. In summary inhibition of PlGF may serve as a new candidate to be targeted in combination therapies or in TKI refractory CML. Disclosures: Carmeliet: Thrombogenics: Research Funding.",
