    "abstract_text": "PPAR(peroxisomal proliferators-activated receptor)\u03b2 is considered to be involved in the lipid metabolism and regulating the inflammatory response and in human myeloma cells PPAR\u03b2is predominantly expressed among these PPARs. However, it remains to be clarified what is the functional role of PPAR\u03b2 in myeloma cells. In order to identify what are the ligands for PPAR\u03b2, we constructed the PPRE\u03b2-luciferase reporter gene and performed the reporter assay in Hela cells. Since we have already identified several reagents (DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone), DHEA-S, baicalein, baicalin, dexamethasone) that suppressed the growth or survival of human myeloma cells ( Cancer Res  65 : 2269 , 2005 ; Blood  105 : 3312 , 2005 ), we analyzed whether these reagents augmented the expression of reporter gene. DHEA-S, baicalein and dexamethasone showed the possibility of their PPAR\u03b2 binding. Furthermore, these reagents could induce or upregulate the expression of PPRE\u03b2-target genes such as ILK and COX2 in myeloma cell lines. We\u2019ve already confirmed that DHEA-S inhibited the proliferation and survival of primary myeloma cells as well as myeloma cell lines, and downregulated the activity of NF-kB, also baicalein showed the growth suppression through the downregulation of NF-kB. Therefore, it is possible that PPAR\u03b2-binding reagents such as DHEA-S and baicalein could counteract NF-kB activity to suppress the growth or survival in myeloma cells, while the exact mechanism is under investigation.",
