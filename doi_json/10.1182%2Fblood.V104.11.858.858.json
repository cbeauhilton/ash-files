    "abstract_text": "A systematic literature review suggests that SLE and TTP co-exist: we identified 51 articles reporting 87 patients who were diagnosed with both TTP and SLE. SLE was diagnosed prior to TTP in 53 (61%), subsequent to TTP in 11 (13%) and simultaneously with TTP in 23 (26%) patients. However a critical distinction is that TTP is a rapidly fatal disease without plasma exchange (PE) treatment while SLE is typically a more chronic disease with intermittent acute flares and PE is not an essential treatment. Therefore when TTP is suspected in a patient with an established diagnosis of SLE, the relative benefits and risks of PE are difficult to assess, since the diagnosis of TTP may be unclear and PE is a procedure with risk for major complications and death. The Oklahoma TTP-HUS Registry has collected serum samples on 185 of 206 (90%) of prospectively enrolled patients with a clinical diagnosis of TTP or HUS from 11/13/1995 to 12/31/2003; all patients have been followed to the present time. We compared presenting features and clinical outcomes of the first episode of TTP-HUS between the 14 (7%) patients in whom SLE had been previously diagnosed to the 22 patients in whom the diagnosis of TTP was supported by severely deficient (<5%) ADAMTS13. None of the 14 patients with a previous diagnosis of SLE had severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (range 7\u2013100%, median 50%). SLE disease activity as measured by the SLEDAI score ranged from 3\u201332, median 10, indicating that SLE manifestations were severe in most patients. Only 2 patients had inactive lupus as indicated by a SLEDAI score <4. SLE was not considered at the time of diagnosis of the first episode of TTP in the 22 patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. Only 1/22 patients has been subsequently diagnosed with SLE; at the time of an apparent relapse of TTP he had serositis and positive serologic tests; his ADAMTS13 activity at that time was 30%. This patient\u2019s course documents the potential overlap of these two disorders.  . SLE-TTP(n=14) . TTP (n=22) . p-value . Median values are presented for continuous data.

Response to PE was poor, all cause mortality was high, and relapses of TTP have not occurred in patients with a previous diagnosis of SLE. These differences suggest that these 2 groups of patients in our Registry are distinct. Therefore in patients with an established diagnosis of SLE in whom the additional diagnosis of TTP-HUS is considered, more intensive immunosuppressive treatment for SLE is appropriate initial management in addition to considering the relative benefits and risks of PE.",
