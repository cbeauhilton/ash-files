    "abstract_text": "Background : Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not cured by first line R-CHOP chemotherapy or second line high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue have a poor prognosis and represent a clear unmet medical need. Lenalidomide (Revlimid\u00ae), an immunomodulatory drug, has activity in hematological malignancies including relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Aim: To determine the activity and safety of lenalidomide monotherapy in relapsed/refractory DLBCL. Methods: Patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL with measurable disease after at least 1 prior treatment regimen were eligible. Patients received 25 mg lenalidomide orally once daily on Days 1\u201321 every 28 days and continued therapy for 52 weeks as tolerated or until disease progression. Response and progression were evaluated using the IWLRC methodology. Univariate analyses using Fisher\u2019s exact test was conducted to investigate and characterize associations of prognostic variables with response. Results : Twenty-six patients with DLBCL lymphoma were enrolled. The median age was 66 (45\u201386) and 13 were female. Median time from diagnosis to lenalidomide was 2.4 (0.5\u201312) years and median number of prior treatment regimens was 3 (1\u20136). Three patients (12%) exhibited an objective complete response (1 complete response (CR) and 2 complete responses unconfirmed (CRu)). Two patients had a partial response (PR) for an overall response rate of 19% and 7 had stable disease (SD). Response to lenalidomide was associated with low disease burden (33% for < 50 cm 2 v 0% for \u2265 50 cm 2 , P=0.06) and longer time from rituximab to lenalidomide treatment (33% for \u2265 230 days v 0% for < 230 days, P=0.05). Patients with favorable values for both these prognostic factors (N = 10) had a 50% response rate [RR] (30% CR/CRu RR) compared with a 0% RR for patients with unfavorable values (N = 16; P < 0.004) and a progression free survival (ongoing) of 7.4 months v 1.9 months. Although there were no responses in the poor prognosis group, 4 patients exhibited stable disease with an ongoing median PFS of > 4.2 months (> 3.6 - > 6.2). Eight patients (31%) required at least one dose reduction with a median time to first dose reduction of 1.8 months (0.4\u20132.9). One patient each (4%) had Grade 4 anemia, cauda equinine syndrome, febrile neutropenia, intermittent rash, lymphopenia, neutropenia, pneumonitis and thrombocytopenia. Most common Grade 3 adverse events were neutropenia (19%), thrombocytopenia (15%) and leukopenia (12%). Conclusion : The prognostic factors of tumor burden and time from last dose of rituximab appear to identify relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients with a high likelihood of response to lenalidomide oral monotherapy.",
