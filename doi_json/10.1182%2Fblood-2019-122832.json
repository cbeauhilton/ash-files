    "abstract_text": "The treatment of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) has deeply changed over years. Purine analogs, namely cladribine (2CdA) now represent the treatment of choice. The BRAF V600E mutation is now regarded as the pathogenic event. One hundred and eighty-four patients were followed between 1986 and 2018 and treated according to era-specific guidelines. This is the largest monocentric series reported. Responses were classified by combining Consensus Resolution criteria and marrow immunohistochemistry. Patients were grouped according to the number of treatment lines they received (table). Ten patients treated with frontline 2CdA and in complete response (CR) for at least 5 years were tested for the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation in peripheral blood by droplet digital PCR as a molecular marker for active disease. Patients treated first line responded in 86% of cases, with 44% CR. Response rates remained high throughout the first 4 lines (84%, 81%, 79% for the second line onward, with CR in 38%, 37%, 15% of cases respectively), although decreasing progressively with the number of treatments received. One hundred and twenty-two patients received 2CdA as first line treatment, with a response rate of 86% and a CR rate of 54%. Among the 66 CR patients, 45 (68%) have never received further therapy: 11 patients are in continuous CR between 5 and 10 years after treatment, 14 between 10 and 20 years and 3 patients at more than 20 years. Median time-to-next treatment (TTNT) for patients after receiving 2CdA was 8.2 years: partial responders had a significantly shorter median TTNT than CR patients (5.3 years versus median not reached at 25.8 years, p=0.0001) (figure). Seven patients in CR for more than 5 years after front line 2CdA were BRAF V6500E negative in peripheral blood. One of these displayed disease recurrence and required further treatment roughly 2 years later. Three patients were positive for the BRAF V600E mutation at 6.5, 8.4 and 13.7 years after treatment and developed an overt disease relapse between 4 months and 2 years. Patients with HCL require subsequent lines of therapy in more than 50% of cases. Purine analogs allow significant response rates when applied first line and upon retreatment. Some patients may enjoy long lasting responses after one course of 2CdA and display no evidence of BRAF V600E mutation in peripheral blood. A PCR-based evaluation of the allelic burden in peripheral blood may provide information regarding disease activity over time.
