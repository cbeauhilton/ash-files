    "abstract_text": "Background: The clinical use of Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), as opposed to warfarin, has become more prevalent in patients with extremes in body weight. However, both the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis' (ISTH) and anti-thrombotic therapy guidelines state that DOACs should be avoided in patients with a body mass index (BMI) >40 kg/m2, weight >120 kg, or weight < 50 kg. The purpose of this study was to analyze the efficacy and safety of DOACs in extremes of weight compared to patients treated with warfarin. Warfarin may be a safer and more effective oral anticoagulant for patients in extremes of weight, due to the availability of dosing based on INR. DOAC standard dosing may either overdose/underdose in patients with low/high BMI respectively. Study Design and Methods: A retrospective, single-institution study evaluated patients with extreme weights receiving a DOAC or warfarin for either venous thromboembolism (VTE) or atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter between October 2016 and October 2020. Inclusion criteria consisted of patients admitted to NYU Langone Hospitals continued on a DOAC or warfarin for VTE or atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter with BMI < 18 kg/m2 or BMI > 30 kg/m2. Patients newly initiated on oral anticoagulation or received anticoagulation other than atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter or VTE were excluded. Primary endpoints include incidence of VTE or bleeding events in anticoagulated patients who meet extreme weight criteria.
