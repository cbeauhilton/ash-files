    "abstract_text": "Aim: Delayed platelet reconstitution in the peripheral blood (PB) remains a problem in transplantation with umbilical cord blood (CB)-derived stem cells. Previously, we have shown that transplantation with ex-vivo expanded CB CD34 + cells (CD34 exp ) with thrombopoietin for 10 days, results in an accelerated platelet reconstitution in NOD/SCID mice. It has been shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are able to enhance the overall engraftment when co-transplanted with CB CD34 + cells. Therefore, we investigated whether co-transplantation of MSC with CD34 + cells or CD34 exp cells may have an additive effect in shortening the time to platelet recovery and on the total number of platelets in the PB at 6 weeks after transplantation. Methods: To evaluate the time to platelet recovery and the total number of platelets at 6 weeks after transplantation, we used 4 groups of irradiated NOD/SCID mice, divided according to the transplant received: 1) CD34 + 2) MSC+CD34 + 3) CD34 exp 4) MSC+CD34 exp . Human platelet recovery was measured twice a week for the first three weeks and once a week thereafter, using an assay that reliably detects 1x10 6 plt/L. The percentage of human CD45 + cells in the bone marrow (BM) was evaluated at 6 weeks after transplantation. Results: In accordance with previous experiments, platelet recovery started earlier in mice transplanted with CD34 exp cells compared to CD34 + cells (Table 1). Co-transplantation of MSC with CD34 + cells did not result in an accelerated platelet recovery during the first 2 weeks after transplantation, as was observed for expanded cells. However, co-transplantation of MSC did enhance the number of platelets at 6 weeks after transplantation (454.2\u00b1264.5 plt/\u03bc l for MSC+CD34 + vs. 101.9\u00b178.4 plt/\u03bc l for CD34 + ). MSC had no affect on either the time to platelet recovery nor the total number of human platelets at 6 weeks after transplantation when co-transplanted with CD34 exp cells. To assess the overall efficacy of the MSC on the engraftment of human CB cells, we evaluated the percentage of human CD45 + cells in the BM of the NOD/SCID mice at 6 weeks after transplantation. In mice transplanted with MSC+CD34 + , the percentage of human CD45 + cells was higher compared to controls transplanted with CD34 + cells only (30.4% for MSC+CD34 + vs. 17.8% for CD34 + ). No further engraftment enhancing effect of MSC was observed following transplantation of CD34 exp cells only (32.1% for CD34 exp vs. 35.7% for MSC+CD34 exp ). Conclusion: Our results show that transplantation with CD34 exp cells results in an accelerated platelet recovery in NOD/SCID mice, an effect that can not be achieved by co-transplantation of MSC+CD34 + cells. However, at 6 weeks after transplantation co-transplantation with MSC+CD34 + cells results in a higher number of platelets in the PB. In addition, the level of engraftment of human CD45 + cells in the BM of NOD/SCID mice is increased by co-transplantation of MSC+CD34 + cells. In contrast, MSC did not affect the time to platelet recovery, the number of human platelets at 6 weeks after transplantation, or the engraftment of human CD45 + cells in the BM when co-transplanted with CD34 exp.
