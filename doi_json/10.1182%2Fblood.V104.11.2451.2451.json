    "abstract_text": "To develop more effective immunotherapy strategies for patients with multiple myeloma (MM), it is important to identify novel tumor antigens. Heat shock protein gp96, a highly conserved glycoprotein, is a chaperon molecule that carries intracellularly processed peptides from proteins synthesized by the cells, including those of tumor-specific or -associated proteins. Recent studies in solid tumors have shown that tumor-derived gp96 is immunogenic and potent at stimulating the generation of tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In this study, we examined whether myeloma-derived gp96 can be used as potent myeloma antigen. To generate myeloma-specific CTLs, immature dendritic cells (DCs), obtained from cultures of blood monocytes from HLA-A2 + healthy individuals or patients, were pulsed with gp96 protein purified from the myeloma cell line U266 (A2 + ), and induced maturation using the cytokine cocktail. Autologous T cells were then stimulated every two weeks with these DCs, and cytotoxicity was examined against gp96-pusled DCs, myeloma cell lines, and primary myeloma cells isolated from patients. After several cycles of in vitro stimulation, specific CTL lines were obtained, which consisted of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. These CTLs demonstrated not only specific cytotoxicity against gp96-pusled DCs and the cell line U266, but also significantly killed A2 + primary myeloma cells. No killing was observed against A2 + normal lymphocytes including B cells or A2 \u2212 myeloma cell lines and primary myeloma cells from patients. Using the cold target inhibition assay, we showed that the same CTLs mediated the killing of both gp96-pulsed DCs and myeloma tumor cells. The cytotoxicity was MHC class I- and, to a lesser extent, class II-restricted, indicating that the gp96 contained both class I- and II-restricted tumor-derived peptides and that myeloma cells naturally present these peptides in the context of their surface MHC molecules. Upon antigen stimulation, these CTLs secreted predominantly interferon-g, detected by the ELISPOT assay and intracellular staining, indicating that they belong to the type-1 T-cell subsets. Furthermore, the CTLs lysed the target cells mainly through the perforin-mediated pathway because Concanamycin A but not Brefeldin-A, the selective inhibitors for perforin- or Fas-, respectively, mediated pathways, abrogated the cytolytic activity of the cells. These results therefore show that myeloma-derived gp96-specific CTLs are able to lyse myeloma tumor cells including primary myeloma plasma cells from patients and, thus, provide a rationale for gp96-based immunotherapy in MM.",
