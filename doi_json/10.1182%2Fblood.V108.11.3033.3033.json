    "abstract_text": "Refractory AML and MDS are difficult diseases to manage, even with allogeneic BMT, due to recurrent disease. In an attempt to cytoreduce prior to BMT, but also avoid the toxicities associated with multiple reinduction attempts, we altered our treatment practice to offer allogeneic BMT while the patient is hypoplastic after reinduction therapy. We retrospectively reviewed 47 consecutive patients (22 males, 25 females; median age 47 years, range 6\u201368,) with AML (n=36) or MDS (n=11) who received a first related (n=23) or unrelated (n=24) allogeneic BMT between 4/1/2003 and 3/31/2006 at Roswell Park Cancer Institute to compare outcomes by pre-BMT disease status. Bone marrow hypoplasia post-reinduction therapy was defined as a particulate biopsy with 0.10 to remove each factor from the model. Since KPS correlated with hypoplastic status, both factors could not be added into the model simultaneously. Factors that were considered in the first model: KPS (\u226590 vs. \u226480), conditioning regimen (FluMel vs. BuC vs. CT vs. FluC), donor (related vs. unrelated), age at BMT (continuous), and FEV1 (continuous). KPS was the only significant predictor of OS (RR=20.5; 95% confidence interval 2.7, 156; p=0.004). Substituting hypoplastic (yes vs. no) for KPS in the model yielded hypoplastic as the only significant factor (RR=3.06; 95% CI 1.3, 7.38; p=0.013). This study demonstrates that patients transplanted with bone marrow hypoplastia secondary to reinduction therapy have a compromised performance status, but that a low KPS is a stronger predictor of poor LFS and OS. Reducing the intensity of the reinduction regimen may increase performance status at BMT and improve overall outcome post-transplant.",
