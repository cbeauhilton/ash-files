    "abstract_text": "Background : Many idiopathic thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP) patients have severe deficiency of ADAMTS13, an enzyme that cleaves ultralarge von Willebrand multimers. We recently reported that thienopyridine-associated TTP is characterized by an immunologic pathway with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency and a non-immunologic pathway with higher ADAMTS13 activity levels. We now compare findings for idiopathic and thienopyridine-associated TTP patients. Methods : Clinical findings and laboratory findings were evaluated for 51 idiopathic and 39 thienopyridine-associated TTP. Results: Clinical findings were similar between idiopathic and thienopyridine-associated TTP for both severe ADAMTS13 deficient and non-deficient patients. Differences were noted in gender and age, relapse rates, and survival. Conclusion : Among TTP patients with ADAMTS13 deficiency, relapses are frequent in idiopathic TTP patients and Rituximab may be useful, while for thienopyridine-associated TTP patients spontaneous relapse are rare as long as no re-exposure occurs. Among ADAMTS13 non-deficient patients, survival is high following therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) for idiopathic patients but not for thienopyridine-associated TTP patients. Despite similarities, idiopathic and thienopyridine associated TTP probably have different initiating factors.
