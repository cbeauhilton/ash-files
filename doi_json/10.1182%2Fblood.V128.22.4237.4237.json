    "abstract_text": "Efflux transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2 interact with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and mediate drug resistance, however, evidence of the interaction of other potentially relevant drug transporters with TKIs is lacking. We investigated the involvement of the closely related transporter ABCC6, in imatinib (IM), nilotinib (NIL) and dasatinib (DAS) transport and also the role of ABCC6 in NIL resistance. The impact of short-term (overnight) exposure to NIL on mRNA expression of ABC transporters in three BCR-ABL1 + cell lines was assessed by Taqman transporter array: K562, K562-Dox and KU812 cells. Several transporters of interest were identified, including ABCC6, based on alterations in mRNA expression. In order to elucidate the importance of ABCC6 in the development of NIL resistance, ABCC6 mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR in K562 and K562-Dox NIL-resistant lines generated in vitro and compared with ABCC6 mRNA levels in respective parental control cells. ABCC6 protein expression was confirmed by western blot. p-Crkl dependent IC50 experiments in the absence and presence of three ABCC6 inhibitors (indomethacin, INDO; probenecid, PRO; pantoprazole, PP) were performed in patient mononuclear cells (MNCs) and BCR-ABL1 + cell lines to assess the role of ABCC6 in NIL, IM and DAS transport. A marked increase in ABCC6 mRNA expression in response to short-term in vitro NIL exposure occurred: in K562 and KU812 cells ABCC6 mRNA levels increased 9.5- and 9.7-fold in response to overnight NIL exposure respectively. Increased expression of ABCC6 was also observed in cells subjected to long-term NIL exposure during development of NIL resistance in vitro . NIL-resistant K562 cells demonstrated up to 57-fold higher levels of ABCC6 mRNA compared with control cells ( p =0.002). Analogous results were observed in NIL-resistant K562-Dox cells (up to 33-fold higher levels of ABCC6 mRNA p =0.002). In order to determine the relevance of ABCC6 in patient cells, p-Crkl dependent IC50 experiments were performed in MNCs from de novo CML patients in the absence and presence of ABCC6 inhibition. Results demonstrated a significant reduction in IC50 NIL in the presence of all three ABCC6 inhibitors compared with IC50 NIL in the absence of inhibitors. Similar results were observed for IC50 DAS but not IC50 IM . Experiments in three parental BCR-ABL1 + cell lines confirmed these findings (Table 1). Notably, comparison of IC50 values in the absence of ABCC6 inhibition in KU812 vs. K562 cells revealed that KU812 cells demonstrated increased IC50 NIL (307 vs. 257 nM, p =0.0493) and IC50 DAS (14 vs 8 nM, p =0.0005). This was unexpected given both cell lines demonstrate negligible expression of ABCB1 (a transporter known to interact with both NIL and DAS). However, assessment of ABCC6 protein levels by western blotting revealed KU812 cells have greater levels of ABCC6 when compared with K562 cells: 53% in KU812 vs. 24% in K562 (ABCC6 normalised to \u03b2-actin). A greater %reduction in IC50 NIL and IC50 DAS in the presence of ABCC6 inhibition was also observed in KU812 cells compared with K562 cells confirming the role of ABCC6 in the transport of NIL and DAS. Combined, these studies highlight the importance of ABCC6 in the export of NIL and DAS from patient MNCs and BCR-ABL1 + cell lines. This is the first report of ABCC6 involvement in TKI transport and results suggest ABCC6 overexpression may also contribute to NIL resistance. The addition of ABCC6 inhibitors to NIL and DAS therapy may enhance the efficacy of these TKIs in the treatment of CML.
