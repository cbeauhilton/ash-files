    "abstract_text": "Purpose: Relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic bone marrow transplantation (AHSCT) in acute leukemia is a poor prognosis indicator. Although there is no definite opinion about the optimal treatment chemotherapy, second allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT2) or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) are among the treatment options. Relapse after allogeneic transplantation remains unfortunately quite common and we frequently face difficult management decisions. The decision to offer either option is based on several factors, including donor availability, remission status, presence of disabling comorbidities, and center or physician preference. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of AHBMT2 or DLI on survival in relapsed transplant patients suffers from acute leukemia. Method: We here in report a retrospective analysis of single-center experience with AHBMT2 and DLI to treat patients relapsing from acute leukemia after a first AHBMT from 2003 to 2018.We enrolled the study 20 patients who underwent DLI and 6 patients who underwent AHBMT2. Result: There was no significant difference in OS between the groups afterward intervention (p:0,9) The 2-year survival rate was 33% in the AHBMT2 group and 43% in the DLI group. After intervention, chronic GVHD was observed only in DLI group. Conclusion : DLI can be considered after relapse as a safer and less toxic method than AHBMT2.
