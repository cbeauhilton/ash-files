    "abstract_text": "The MLLT10 gene, a known fusion partner for KMT2A , encodes AF10 protein, a transcription factor that binds unmodified histone H3 and regulates DOT1L expression. KMT2A-MLLT10 fusion portends adverse outcome, but MLLT10 function and prognostic implications in partnership with other genes has not been defined. In comprehensive transcriptome and karyotype evaluation of 2226 children and young adults (0-30 years), we defined the full spectrum of MLLT10 fusions, identified new fusion partners, and correlated MLLT10 structural variants with clinical outcome. We also evaluated transcription and methylation profiles to identify genes dysregulated in MLLT10 fusions with and without KMT2A . 2226 patients treated on Children's Oncology Group (COG) trials AAML0531 and AAML1031 were evaluated by transcriptome profiling and/or karyotyping to identify leukemia associated fusions and copy number changes associated with prognosis. Collectively, 127 patients (5.7%) had primary fusions involving MLLT10 : 104 (82%) involving KMT2A (KMT2A-MLLT10) , and 23 patients (18%) revealed other fusion partners ( MLLT10-X ). Alternate, recurrent fusion partners included PICALM (n=13), DDX3X (n=2), and TEC (n=2), while fusions with 6 other partner genes ( DDX3Y, CEP164, NAP1L1, SCN2B, TREH , and XPO1 ) were each identified in single patients. Given the known association of KMT2A-MLLT10 fusions with adverse outcome, we sought to determine whether MLLT10-X had distinct characteristics and comparable outcomes. Initial comparison of disease characteristics in patients with and without KMT2A as fusion partner showed significant differences in age at diagnosis. Those with KMT2A-MLLT10 had a median age of 1.7 years (range 0-21.3), compared to 12.7 years (range 1.4-18.9) in those with MLLT10-X (p \u2264 0.001). There was no significant difference in gender, race, mutational status, or white blood cell count between these two cohorts. MLLT10 rearranged patients (n=127) demonstrated adverse outcomes, with 5-year event-free survival (EFS) of 18.6% vs. 49% in non- MLLT10 rearranged patients (N=1953, p<0.001, Fig 1A ) and poorer 5 year overall survival (OS, 38.8% vs. 65.4%, p \u2264 0.001). Next, we investigated the outcome of MLLT10 rearranged patients with and without KMT2A as a fusion partner . Patients with KMT2A-MLLT10 fusions had an EFS from study entry of 19.5% vs. 12.7% for those with alternate fusion partners (p=0.628, Fig 1B ). The two cohorts also had similar relapse risk (RR) from remission with 84.7% ( KMT2A-MLLT10) to that of 74.6% for MLLT10-X (p=0.876). Next we explored the transcriptome profile of patients with MLLT10 fusions to determine the impact of fusion partners, using ribodepleted RNA-seq data from 1049 patients treated on COG AAML1031. MLLT10 -fusion-positive cases (n=66) were compared to other AML cases (n=983) in a differential expression (DE) analysis (limma/voom) ( Fig 1C ). Of 1,910 genes significantly differentially expressed, HOXA family genes were among the top 30 upregulated genes, with HOXA11 identified as >6 logFC, or over 400x higher on average in MLLT10 rearranged patients. To determine if patients with MLLT10 fusions had distinct epigenetic profiles, we performed differential methylation analyses on samples from normal bone marrow and patients with 4 high-risk molecular features: MLLT10 rearranged, KMT2A rearranged, NUP98 - NSD1 fused, and FLT3 -ITD, across nearly 1 million CpG sites on the Infinium EPIC array (Illumina, CA). After fitting a multivariate model with all of the interacting molecular features, the 250 most discriminative regions were extracted and plotted (ComplexHeatmap) ( Fig 1D) . Strikingly, patients with MLLT10-X fusions cluster discretely with ultra-high-risk NUP98-NSD1 fusion patients, showing a broadly hypermethylated profile, while KMT2A-MLLT10 patients cluster within the larger KMT2A category and show far fewer hypermethylated regions. We identified patients with MLLT10 fusion partners not previously described, and compared them to other AML patients, as well as patients with known MLLT10 partners KMT2A and PICALM . All MLLT10- aberrant cases had poor EFS and OS, high RR, overexpressed HOXA genes, and distinct DNA methylation profiles, while patients with MLLT10-X fusions tend to be older children. Regardless of fusion partner, patients with MLLT10 fusions exhibit very high risk, and should be prioritized for alternative therapeutic intervention.
