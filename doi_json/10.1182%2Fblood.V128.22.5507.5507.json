    "abstract_text": "Objective: To investigate the change of mitophagy level of bone marrow nucleated red blood cell in anemia patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), to explore its significance in the anemic pathogenesis of MDS. Methods: Fifty anemia patients with MDS and twenty-six normal controls were enrolled in this study. The mitophagy were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The level of autophagy-associated protein LC3B, the number of mitochondria, mitochondrial membrane potential, the level of ROS in GlycoA + nucleated red blood cell were measured by Flow cytometry .The expression of AMPK, ULK1, mTOR mRNA of GlycoA + nucleated red blood cell were measured by real time PCR. The expression of the mitochondrial outer membrane protein TOM20 in GlycoA + nucleated red blood cell were detected by Western blotting. Results: (1) Autophagosome or autolysosome including mitochondria were scarcely observed by TEM. (2) The expression of LC3B in GlycoA + nucleated red blood cell in high-risk MDS patients(0.22\u00b10.12) was significantly lower than that in normal controls (0.43\u00b10.22, P0.05); (3) The number of mitochondria in GlycoA + nucleated red blood cell in high-risk MDS patients (937.17\u00b1707.85) was significantly higher than that in normal controls (513.49\u00b1372.33, P0.05); (4) The level of mitochondrial membrane potential in GlycoA + nucleated red blood cell in high-risk MDS patients(4.24\u00b13.00)was significantly higher than that in normal controls (2.04\u00b11.11, P0.05); (5) The level of ROS in GlycoA + nucleated red blood cell in high-risk MDS patients(438.65\u00b1322.83)was significantly higher than that in normal controls (242.77\u00b1136.87, P0.05); (6) The expression of AMPK mRNA in GlycoA + nucleated red blood cell in high-risk MDS patients(1.06\u00b11.51) was significantly lower than that in low-risk MDS patients (4.35\u00b14.79, P>0.05), there were no significant difference with normal controls(P>0.05). (7) The exception of ULK1 mRNA in GlycoA + nucleated red blood cell in high-risk MDS patients (0.64\u00b10.91) was significantly lower than that in normal controls (2.70\u00b13.27, P0.05). (9) The expression of mitochondrial outer membrane protein TOM20 in high-risk MDS patients was higher than that in normal controls. Conclusion: The pathogenesis of anemia in MDS may be correlated with declining mitophagy level, increasing damaged mitochondria, increasing ROS, DNA damage, and shortening the life of nucleated red blood cells, it may be an effective method to induce mitophagy to correct anemia in MDS.
