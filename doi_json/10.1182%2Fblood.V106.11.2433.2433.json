    "abstract_text": "\u03b3We and others have previously described polymorphisms in codon 158 and 48 for Fc\u03b3RIII\u03b1 as predictors of clinical responses to the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab in patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, including Waldenstro\u0308m\u2019s Macroglobulinemia. The expression of at least one valine (V) at Fc\u03b3RIII\u03b1-158 and Leucine/Histidine (L/H) at Fc\u03b3RIII\u03b1-48 is associated with higher response rates to rituximab, though primacy for Fc\u03b3RIII\u03b1-158 over 48 polymorphisms for determining rituximab response is attributed to genetic linkage. As part of these studies, we sought to determine if polymorphisms in FC\u03b3RIIA were linked to FC\u03b3RIIIA since higher response rates have been observed in patients who express Histidine/Histidine (H/H) in Fc\u03b3RIIA-131. We therefore performed sequence analysis of the whole Fc\u03b3RIIa gene and exons 3 and 4 of the Fc\u03b3RIIIa gene in 52 healthy donors. The genetic association between polymorphisms was calculated using the statistical program GOLD and expressed as linkage disequilibrium (D\u2019). Single nucleotide polymorphisms were commonly found in Fc\u03b3RIIIa at codons 158, 48 and in Fc\u03b3RIIa at codons 131, 27. The genotype frequencies for polymorphisms are as follows: Fc\u03b3RIIIa-158: 25% F/F; 63% F/V; 12% V/V; Fc\u03b3RIIIa-48: 67% L/L; 10% L/R; 17% L/H; Fc\u03b3RIIa-131: 29% H/H; 46% H/R; 25% R/R; Fc\u03b3RIIa-27: 71% Q/Q; 27% Q/W; 2% W/W. Strong linkage was found between the Fc\u03b3RIIIa-158 and \u221248 (D\u2019=1, p=0.001), as well as between Fc\u03b3RIIa-131 and -27 (D\u2019=1, p=0.00082). Specifically, the expression of F at Fc\u03b3RIIIa-158 was found to be associated with expression of L at Fc\u03b3RIIIa-48, whereas the expression of H at Fc\u03b3RIIa-131 was associated with the expression of Q at Fc\u03b3RIIa-27. Importantly, we observed links among polymorphisms at Fc\u03b3RIIa and Fc\u03b3RIIIa. Specifically, Fc\u03b3RIIIa-48 was linked to Fc\u03b3RIIa-27 (D\u2019=0.765, p<0.00001) and Fc\u03b3RIIa-131 (D\u2019=1, p=0.0049), since all donors who were Fc\u03b3RIIIa-48 L/L donors were also Fc\u03b3RIIa-27Q/Q and -131R/R, respectively. Lastly, we also observed linkage between Fc\u03b3RIIIa-158 and Fc\u03b3RIIa-27 (D\u2019=1, p=0.0008). Our results demonstrate significant genetic association between polymorphisms in Fc\u03b3RIIa and Fc\u03b3RIIIa genes, and may account for the primary predictive role ascribed to polymorphisms in Fc\u03b3RIIIa-158 in determining rituximab responses.",
