    "abstract_text": "Because B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) can not be cured with current therapies, but in general has a slow progression and rather long median survival, it is considered an attractive candidate for active T cell mediated immunotherapy. However B-CLL cells have poor antigen presenting capacity because they express low levels of co-stimulatory molecules. Moreover, most immunotherapeutic strategies require knowledge of the eliciting tumor antigen and/or ex vivo manipulation of patient cells. To circumvent these drawbacks we aim to redirect existing viral immunity towards B-CLL. Previously, we have shown that in patients with B-CLL considerably expanded numbers of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific CD45RA + CD27 CD8 + cytotoxic T cells are present ( W. Mackus et al. Blood  2003 ; 102 : 1057 ). These cells are potent cytotoxic effector cells when directed against B-CLL cells loaded with CMV peptide ( A.Kater et al. Br.J. Haematol.  2004 ; 126 : 512 ). In the current study, we apply a novel bridging reagent to redirect CMV-specific CTL to specifically target B-CLL. The targeting complex is composed of a streptavidin fused anti-CD20 single chain variable fragment (scFv) in combination with biotinylated MHC class I molecules containing CMV pp65 peptide (HLA/CMV). We demonstrate that this complex is stable on the cell surface for \u226524 hours, and that B-CLL cells coated with this CD20-HLA/CMV complex can be lysed by autologous CMV-specific CD8 + CTL with similar efficiency as B-CLL cells directly loaded with CMV-peptide. Killing occurs at scFv CD20 concentrations of \u2265100 ng ml \u22121 and HLA/CMV concentrations of \u226520 ng ml \u22121 . Lysis of CD20-HLA/CMV complex coated CLL cells could not be blocked by anti-LFA1 antibodies, in contrast to B-CLL cells directly loaded with CMV-peptide, indicating a different immunological synapse. HLA- A2 positive B-CLL cells coated with HLA- B7 /CMV complexes were only lysed by HLA- B7 positive CMV-specific CTL, whereas HLA- A2 /CMV complex targeted HLA- A2 positive B-CLL cells were unaffected by HLA- B7 positive CMV specific CTL, proving HLA restriction of the killing.. Furthermore, CD20-HLA/CMV complex coated B-CLL cells induce both proliferation and cytokine production (interferon \u03b3, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 \u03b2) in CMV-specific CD8+ T cells. Thus, CD20-HLA/CMV complexes elicit both immune activation and direct cytotoxicity towards B-CLL cells. The findings of our study constitute a necessary step towards possible application of CD20-HLA/CMV complexes for immunotherapy of B cell malignancies. It is obvious that this recently recognized capacity to redirect existing antiviral immunity towards tumor cells has a utility in cancer immunotherapy far beyond CMV and B-CLL.",
