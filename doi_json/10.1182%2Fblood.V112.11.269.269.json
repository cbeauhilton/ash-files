    "abstract_text": "Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), in which patients develop antibodies to complexes formed by heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4), is the most frequent drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia. Extensive studies in vitro and our previous studies in vivo using a transgenic mouse model of HIT have shown that antibodies reactive with heparin-PF4 complexes lead to FcgRIIa receptor-mediated platelet activation. In this study we investigated whether PRT060318 (PRT318), a novel Syk inhibitor, prevents HIT antibody-mediated platelet activation both in vitro and in vivo . PRT318 at concentrations of 0.3 to 3 \u03bcM completely inhibited HIT immune complex (IC)-induced aggregation in both human and transgenic mouse platelets. In the absence of the inhibitor, HIT IC-induced final aggregation was 50\u201360%. At concentrations of PRT318 less than 0.1 \u03bcM, or in the presence of vehicle only, there was no inhibition of aggregation. Aggregation was not inhibited by PRT318 at any concentration when platelets were stimulated by ADP (5\u201320 \u03bcM final concentration). We also show that PRT318 prevents HIT IC-induced thrombocytopenia in vivo using a transgenic mouse HIT model. All mice were treated with KKO, a mouse monoclonal HIT antibody. On days 1 to 4 following antibody injection, the experimental group (n = 13) received orally dosed PRT318 (30 mg/kg body weight) twice a day by gavage while the control group (n = 11) was similarly treated with vehicle only (water). Both experimental and control mice were injected with heparin (1600 U/kg body weight, SQ, once daily). Nadir platelet counts of PRT318-treated mice were significantly higher than control mice (89.8 \u00b1 1.1% of baseline vs. 48.8 \u00b1 6.7%; p = 0.00003). The PRT318 concentration, 2 hrs post dose, in mouse plasma from treated mice was measured as 7.1 \u03bcM, consistent with the concentration which blocked FcgRIIa-mediated platelet activation in vitro . These studies demonstrate that Syk inhibitor PRT318 is an active agent in HIT. View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure "
