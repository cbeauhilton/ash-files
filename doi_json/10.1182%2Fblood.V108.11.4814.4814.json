    "abstract_text": "Missense point mutations in the region encoding the ABL tyrosine kinase domain have been reported in approximately 35% of patients with imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The reported mutations result in reactivation of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. Screening patients with imatinib-resistant CML, we identified 42 different mutations in the ABL tyrosine kinase domain-encoding region, 2 of which were silent (no amino acid change): A864G and G909A. The A864G mutation was associated with a 54-nucleotide reduction in the length of the mRNA transcript, representing a loss of nucleotides 1089-1143; the G909A mutation was associated with a normal-length transcript. The nt1089-1143 transcript deletion represents a partial exon deletion in which the first half of exon 8 is skipped, suggesting that A864G leads to abnormal splicing. Splicing is regulated by 6- to 8-nucleotide exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) and exonic splicing silencer (ESS) motifs recognized by the SR proteins (a family of splicing factors). We therefore used ESEfinder to examine whether A864G or G909A alter ESE motifs, which could block the ability of SR proteins to recognize and bind. This search showed that A864G is at the 7 th position of an AGCTGCAG ESE motif, a binding site for SR35, and is within 35 bp of the intron-exon junction. In total, ESEfinder predicted 18 putative SR35-binding ESEs within 50 bp of the intron-exon junction, covering 20% of the kinase domain. The AGCTGCAG motif is conserved in primates (chimpanzees and monkeys) but not in rodents, while A864G is found in mice Although similar links cannot be made with the G909A mutation, these data suggest that imatinib resistance may develop in some patients through alternative splicing and the expression of a truncated (or potentially elongated) protein."
