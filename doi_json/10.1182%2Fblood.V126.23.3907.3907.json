    "abstract_text": "Background: Constitutive activation of NF-\u03baB signaling is a hallmark of DLBCL. Activation of NF-\u03baB is a multifactorial process resulting from oncogenic mutations ( CARD11 , MYD88\u2026 ), chromosomal abnormalities, chronic activation of B-cell receptor signaling (BCR) as well as stimuli from the microenvironment. Chronic activation of BCR is not only the result of gene mutations (e.g. CD79B ) but also is the result of stimuli generated from the lymphoma microenvironment. We previously found that smoothened (SMO), transducer of hedgehog (Hh) signaling, enhanced NF-\u03baB activation in lymphoma cells, independently of the presence of oncogenic mutations (Changju et al., Blood 2013). Hh ligands are provided by the lymphoma microenvironment (e.g. stromal cells) to activate SMO in the lymphoma cells. Activated SMO, recruits and activates trimeric-G-coupled proteins to activate PKC\u03b2/CARMA1/TRAF6/NEMO axis, followed by assembling of the CARMA1/BCL10/MALT1/TRAF6 complex to SMO resulting in NF-\u03baB activation. Now, we reveal an additional mechanism by which SMO further contributes to the activation of NF-\u03baB in DLBCL. Summary of results : We explored if recombinant Hh ligand can activate NF-\u03baB signaling in the presence of the BTK inhibitor (PCI-32765). Hh stimulation resulted in phosphorylation of PLCg2 (downstream of BTK) and partially rescued the inhibitory effect of the BTK inhibitor on phosphorylation of PLCg2 suggesting a crosstalk between SMO and BCR receptor signaling. We identified that SMO forms a complex with TRAF-6 and PLCg2 using immunoprecipitation and Duolink in situ proximity ligation assays. We found that SMO stabilizes and protects TRAF-6 from proteosomal degradation. SMO-dependent TRAF6 stabilization is mediated by the ubiquitin-specific protease-8 (USP-8) by removing ubiquitin from K48-linked lysine of TRAF6. Conclusions : Collectively, our data reveals multilayer crosstalk between Hh and BCR/NF-\u03baB pathways and provide significant insights into how SMO contributes to chemotolerance and progression of DLBCL. We expect that our results will delineate novel molecular mechanisms involved in the pathobiology of DLBCL that may serve as therapeutic targets.
