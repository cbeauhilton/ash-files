    "abstract_text": "Introduction Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (Allo-SCT) remains an option for patients with chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL). Our program employs a strategy using allo-SCT for patients (pts) with high risk disease based on clinical characteristics and prior therapy. We performed a retrospective analysis to examine long-term disease control and treatment toxicity. Methods A total of 52 patients (pts) are included who underwent allo-SCT at our institution between Aug 1989 and Dec 2005. Patients were in a chemosensitive remission at the time of SCT. The conditioning regimen consisted of busulfan (1 mg/kg PO q6h X4 days between 1989\u2013200 and 3.2 mg/kg IV daily X 4days subsequently) and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg X 2 days. Cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg X 2 days and TBI 12 Gy was used for unrelated donor SCT. Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) SCT were typically performed with Fludarabine 50 mg/m2 for 4 days and 2 Gy TBI. GVHD prophylaxis was with cyclosporine A and methotrexate. Results There were 34 males and 18 females. The median age at the time of transplant was 51 years (range 26 to 65). Histologic subtype was: CLL and/or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL); 48 and T-prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL): 4. The median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 3 (range 1 \u2013 10) and was unavailable in 16. Prior chemotherapies included: anthracycline-based: 24, prior purine analog: 32, prior platinum-based: 8, prior auto-SCT: 1, prior rituximab: 5. The median time from diagnosis to allo-SCT was 58 months (range 5 \u2013 260). 10 pts underwent RIC SCT. Graft source was: matched sibling (MSD) bone marrow (BM): 18, MSD peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC): 20, Mismatch related (MMRD) bone marrow (BM): 1, MRD PBSC: 4, matched unrelated donor (MUD) BM: 8, MUD PBSC: 1. At 5 years, the overall survival of the entire cohort is 51% (95% confidence intervals: 34 \u2013 68%) with two long-term survivors of 14 and 17 years. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 20 of 52 pts (38%). 4 pts have relapsed ((8% of total cohort) and non-relapse mortality was 1 pt (2%). Overall survival by intensity of SCT conditioning regimen was not significant (p=0.3). TRM was similar in pts who received fully myeloablative SCT (40% vs. 20% in RICSCT group, p=0.29). Conclusions Acceptable survival post-SCT is possible using an allo-SCT strategy in CLL. However, TRM remains high in this group of heavily pre-treated patients with a median age of over 50 that predominantly received fully myeloablative allo-SCT. Due to small sample size, the potential benefit of reduced TRM with RICSCT cannot be demonstrated. Ideally, allo-SCT should be considered earlier in the course of the disease based on risk stratification utilizing traditional risk factors and modern prognostic factors such as FISH studies and novel markers."
