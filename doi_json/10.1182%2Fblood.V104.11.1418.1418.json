    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is associated with significant genomic instability. Homologous recombination (HR), which is elevated in MM, is considered to be responsible for this instability. As endonucleases play an important role in mediating HR, here we have evaluated the role of endonuclease in biology and progression of MM. Gene expression profile using Affymetrix U133 array showed > 2 fold elevation of Ape1 or Ape2 or both in 5 of 6 MM cell lines and 12 of 15 patient samples. Immunocytochemistry confirmed upregulation of Ape1 protein in MM cell lines. A Plasmid degradation assay confirmed significantly elevated endonuclease activity in MM cells compared to normal plasma cells. To identify the pre-dominating endonuclease activity, the degradation assay was carried out in the presence of specific endonuclease inhibitors. Harmane and methoxyamine (MA), specific inhibitors of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases effectively inhibited significant endonuclease activity, while other endonuclease inhibitors ACPD and FK506 had minimal effects, confirming predominant role of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases (APE) in mediating increased endonuclease activity in MM. We investigated the role of elevated APE endonuclease activity on DNA recombination and subsequent genomic re-arrangements. Using a plasmid-based assay we have previously demonstrated significantly elevated homologous recombination (HR) in MM. Inhibition of endonuclease by methoxyamine suppressed HR activity by 85 \u00b1 2% in MM cells. Next, we evaluated whether inhibition of HR by methoxyamine can affect the frequency of acquisition of new genetic changes in MM cells using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays (Affymetrix) as indicator of genomic instability. In three independent experiments, methoxyamine reduced the acquisition of new loss of heterozygocity (LOH) loci by an average of 71%. These data suggest that the dysregulated APE endonucleases contribute significantly to the genomic instability, acquisition of new mutations and progression of MM and provides the rationale for targeting endonuclease activity to prevent disease progression including development of drug resistance."
