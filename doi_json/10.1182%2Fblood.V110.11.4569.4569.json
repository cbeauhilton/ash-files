    "abstract_text": "Background: Food can change the bioavailability of a drug, which can have clinically significant consequences. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of food on the oral bioavailability of dasatinib (SPRYCEL\u00ae) in healthy adult subjects. Methods: Fifty-four healthy adult subjects received a single dose of dasatinib 100 mg dose, as 2 x 50 mg film-coated tablets after an overnight fast and within 10 minutes after the ingestion of a low-fat meal (315 kcal [20% fat, 68% carbohydrates, and 12% protein]) and a high-fat meal (985 kcal [52% fat, 34% carbohydrates, and 14% protein]) in a randomly assigned sequence. Individual treatments were separated by at least a 7-day washout period. Serial blood samples were collected for 24 hours after each treatment to determine dasatinib plasma concentrations using a validated liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric method. Dasatinib pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were determined using a non-compartmental method. Safety was monitored throughout the study. Results: Of the 54 healthy adult subjects (85% male, 61% Caucasian, mean age 32 y, and weight 80 kg), 48 completed the study. There were no serious adverse events. Adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were, in general, typical of those seen with dasatinib administration. PK results are summarized in the table below. Conclusions: Compared to the fasted state, a low-fat meal decreased Cmax and AUC of dasatinib by 21%; a high-fat meal decreased Cmax by 24% and increased AUC by 14%. These results are not expected to be of clinical relevance and, therefore, dasatinib may be taken without regard to meals. The drug was generally safe and well-tolerated when administered in the fed or fasted state. Statistical Analysis of PK Parameters for Dasatinib  Treatment . PK Parameter .
