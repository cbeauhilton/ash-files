    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3564 Poster Board III-501 Regulatory T cells (Treg) have been shown previously to reduce graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) but allow for graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effects. It is still unclear why the adoptive Treg transfer does not paralyze every immune response to the same extent. In that context Treg recruitment and localization may account for differential immune regulation. Therefore, we studied the impact of lymphoma and inflammation derived chemoattractive signals on Treg recruitment. Luciferase transgenic Treg accumulated in B cell lymphoma (BCL) tissue after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) when no conventional T cells were given. Microarray based analysis of the BCL tissue revealed increased expression of the CXC chemokine ligands (CXCL) 9, 10, 12 and CCL22. In vivo antibody based neutralization or interference with receptor signaling identified CCL22 and CXCL12 as critical chemokines for Treg attraction towards BCL tissue after alloHCT. Conversely, the CXCL9/10-CXCR3 axis was not critical for Treg recruitment. Depletion of antigen presenting cells (APC) from BCL tissue abrogated CCL22/CXCL12 secretion. CD11c-DTR recipients displayed reduced Treg recruitment towards BCL, indicative for a major role of host APC in the process of Treg recruitment. Strong local inflammatory stimuli caused by subcutaneous complete Freund's adjuvant injection caused local Treg accumulation and reduced recruitment to the BCL. Infusion of conventional T cells that caused subacute GvHD related inflammation redirected Treg towards secondary lymphoid organs and abdominal GvHD target organs. In conclusion our study demonstrates the following novel findings: First Treg are recruited towards BCL infiltrated tissues after alloHCT and this process is dependent on CCL22 and CXCL12 production. Secondly, BCL infiltrating host type APC are the major source for CCL22 and CXCL12 and their targeted deletion impacts Treg recruitment towards BCL tissue. Thirdly, strong local or systemic inflammation can redirect Treg trafficking in the presence of BCL and affect the accumulation of this cell population at the tumor site which may explain why Treg preferentially regulate GvHD reactions post allografting.
