    "abstract_text": "Bone-resorbing osteoclasts play a central role in bone remodeling, which occurs throughout life. Many skeletal diseases such as osteoporosis, Paget\u2019s disease and the lytic lesions of multiple myeloma, display excess osteoclast activity. Thus, in addition to basic biological questions, there is considerable clinical interest in the control of osteoclast differentiation and function. Previously we have demonstrated that the small GTPases Rac1 and Rac2 have specific roles in the control of hematopoietic stem cell and neutrophil functions (Gu and Filippi et al., Science 2003; Filippi et al., Nat Immunol 2004; Cancelas et al., Nat Med 2005). During these studies, we noted differences in the bone structure of Rac-deficient mice, suggesting alterations in osteoclast activity. Furthermore we found that in hematopoietic stem cells Rac proteins regulate signaling pathways that are also known to control osteoclastogenesis. In this study, we have employed a genetic approach to analyze the roles of Rac proteins in osteoclast differentiation. We utilized constitutively Rac2-null mice in combination with cre-induced deletion of floxed Rac1 sequences to effect the loss of both Rac GTPases in hematopoietic cells. Macrophages from Rac2\u2212/\u2212 mice generated normal numbers of osteoclasts in vitro. However, the full differentiation of these cells, as assayed by emergence of differentiation markers, was perturbed. Expression the TRAP (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) enzyme was delayed (12 +/\u22123% vs. 88 +/\u22128%, Rac2\u2212/\u2212 vs. wt, n= 5, p<0.001) and the expression of the \u03b23 integrin subunit was decreased (16% vs. 76%, Rac2\u2212/\u2212 vs. wt, n=5). The number of cells having podosomes was reduced (8 +/\u22123 vs. 206 +/\u221248 cells with podosomes/well Rac2\u2212/\u2212 vs. wt, p<0.001). Cell fusion, which accompanies osteoclastogenesis, was also reduced. In contrast Rac1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages produced severely reduced numbers of osteoclasts in vitro (13 +/\u22128/well vs. 272 +/\u221252 Rac1\u2212/\u2212 vs. wt, n=2, p<0.001). Rac1\u2212/\u2212Rac2\u2212/\u2212 double knock-out cells essentially developed no osteoclasts in vitro. The p44/42, JNK1 (jun N-terminal kinase 1), Akt and p38 intracellular kinase signaling pathways have all been shown to be important for osteoclastogenesis. Activation of the p44/42 pathway in response to stimulation with M-CSF (macrophage colony stimulating factor) and RANKL (receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand), cytokines critically involved in osteoclast differentiation, was reduced in the Rac2\u2212/\u2212 macrophages. When Rac1\u2212/\u2212 cells were stimulated with RANKL, decreased activation of NF-\u03baB and JNK1 was observed. Interestingly, the combination of Rac1 and Rac2 deficiencies induces a significant increase of bone mass in vivo (bone volume/tissue volume 0.33 \u00b1 0.03 vs. 0.13 \u00b1 0.02 Rac1\u2212/\u2212Rac2\u2212/\u2212 vs. wild-type; p<0.001), similar to osteopetrosis models. These results indicate that Rac GTPases are critical to the differentiation of macrophages into osteoclasts, Rac2 deficiency perturbs osteoclast differentiation while in the absence of Rac1 it is severely inhibited, specific alterations in intracellular signaling pathways are seen in Rac-deficient osteoclast precursors, and inhibition of Rac function in vivo leads to an increase in bone mass due to, at least in part, deficient osteoclast function.",
