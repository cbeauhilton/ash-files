Although initially treatable, MM ultimately becomes refractory to treatment, and is invariably fatal, when tumor cells that harbor genetic mutations expand without regulation. Therefore novel treatment targets need to be identified. A key mechanism in MM pathogenesis is regulation of tumor growth by the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, particularly by bone marrow neo-vascularization and adhesion of tumor cells to the marrow stroma. Aberrantly expressed genes that regulate angiogenesis by MM cells enhance MM progression and constitute targets in its treatment. JAM-A/F11R is an endothelial cell (EC) adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily which is a multifunctional cell membrane protein that mediates intracellular signaling events that alter EC migration and paracellular permeability. For example, in breast cancer, attenuation of JAM-A increases tumor invasion and metastasis through a decrease in tumor adhesion (Ulas Naik Cell Adh Migr. 2008 Oct;2(4):249-51.). In this study we explored the JAM-A/F11R expression in MM tumor cells and in patients to determine the potential role of this molecule in the pathogenesis and progression of MM. Methods: The MM cell lines examined were RPMI-8266, U266, and NCI-H929. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) served as controls. Informed consent was obtained from patients and control subjects. Primary BM tumor cells were enriched to > 95% CD138+ cells by positive selection using anti-CD138 MACS MicroBeads. The CD138-negative fraction was used for outgrowth of confluent EPCs (> 98% vWF/CD133/KDR+). JAM-A mRNA expression was assessed using an microarray gene expression profile, JAM-A probe based real-time PCR, and JAM-A levels in each sample were measure using a standard curve and normalized to GADPH. JAM-A protein levels in MM cell lines and primary tumor cells were measured by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. For serum studies, peripheral blood was obtained from 25 newly diagnosed MM patients and 8 healthy, age- and sex-matched controls, and JAM-A levels were measured using an ELISA. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test, two-tailed, with P ' .05 considered significant. Results: JAM-A mRNA levels were significantly increased in MM cell lines RPMI-8266, U266, and NCI-H929 compared to HUVECs (U266, P = 3\u00d710-5; RPM1-8266, P = 1\u00d710-6; NC1-H929, P= 5\u00d710-4). The JAM-A mRNA levels were significantly greater in RPMI-8226; P < .04 compared to TNF\u03b1-activated HUVECs for 24 hours which is a proangiogenic switch for HUVEC gene expression. The elevated mRNA expression of the JAM-A in MM cell lines was confirmed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry which showed the presence of both membrane and cytoplasmic JAM-A protein. Microarray analysis of gene expression profiles from 20 patients' corresponding tumor cells and microenvironmental EPCs showed that JAM-A had a higher level of expression in tumor cells versus MM EPC by 12.62 fold, (P=.0000642). Furthermore, JAM-A had a higher level of expression in MM EPC versus normal control EPC by 2.41 fold, (P=.00113) reflecting a complex regulatory role of F11 signaling in MM, similar to breast cancer (Naik, U. et al 2008). JAM-A was also found to be 12.6 fold greater in tumor cells compared to EPCS (P=.0000642). In addition, circulating levels of soluble JAM-A were found to be significantly greater in the serum of MM patients compared to controls (P < .005), with an average 2-fold increase. Serum levels of JAM-A in MM patients also decreased 71% with treatment n=5, P<.05. Conclusion: We show for the first time that JAM-A expression is highly elevated in MM tumor cells and its levels respond to treatment. In addition, MM patients have higher circulating JAM-A levels compared to healthy individuals and circulating JAM-A levels were reduced following treatment, suggesting that JAM-A may serve as a novel biomarker in MM. Current studies in the lab are aimed at correlating these levels with clinical parameters to determine whether JAM-A levels reflect disease severity and response to treatment. Results of these analyses, as well as results of ongoing experiments using JAM-A siRNA and antibody-inhibition approaches to target JAM-A in myeloma tumor and ECs will be presented.
