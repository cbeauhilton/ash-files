    "abstract_text": "Hox transcription factors have emerged as important regulators of hematopoiesis. In particular, enforced expression of HOXB4 is a potent stimulus for murine hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal. Murine HSCs engineered to overexpress HoxB4 expand significantly more than control cells in vivo and ex vivo while maintaining a normal differentiation program. HSCs are regulated by the cell proliferation machinery that is intrinsically controlled by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21 Cip1/Waf1 (p21) and p27 Kip1 (p27). The p21 protein restricts cell cycling of the hematopoietic stem cell pool and maintains hematopoietic stem cell quiescence. In order to ask whether enhanced proliferation due to HOXB4 overexpression is mediated through suppression of p21 we overexpressed HOXB4 in hematopoietic cells from p21 \u2212/\u2212 mice. First, we investigated whether human HOXB4 enhances in vitro expansion of BM cells from p21 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to p21 +/+ mice. 5FU treated BM cells from p21 \u2212/\u2212 or p21 +/+ mice were pre-stimulated with SCF, IL-6, IL-3 for 2 days followed by transduction using retroviral vector expressing HOXB4 together with GFP (MIGB4) or the control GFP vector (MIG). The cells were maintained in suspension cultures for 13 days and analyzed for GFP positive cells by flow-cytometry. Compared to MIG transduced BM cells from p21 +/+ mice (MIG/p21 + ), the numbers of GFP positive cells were increased 1.1-fold in MIG/p21 \u2212 , 3.2-fold in MIGB4/p21 + and 10.0-fold in MIGB4/p21 \u2212 respectively (n=5). CFU assays were performed after 13 days of culture. The numbers of CFU were increased 4.8-fold in MIG/p21 \u2212 , 19.5-fold in MIG/p21 + and 33.9 -fold in MIGB4/p21 \u2212 respectively. Next, we evaluated level of HSCs expansion by bone marrow repopulation assays. After 12-days of culture, 1.5 x 10 5 MIGB4 or MIG-transduced cells (Ly5.2) were transplanted into lethally irradiated mice in combination with 8 x 10 5 fresh Ly5.1 bone marrow cells. Sixteen weeks after transplantation, no Ly5.2 cells could be detected in MIG/p21 + or MIG/p21 \u2212 transplanted mice (n=6). In contrast, Ly5.2 positive cells were detected in both MIGB4/p21 +/+ and MIGB4/p21 \u2212/\u2212 cells. The % of Ly5.2 positive cells in MIGB4/p21 \u2212 transplanted mice was 9.9-fold higher than MIGB4/p21 + transplanted mice. (38.4 % vs 3.9 %, P<0.02, n=5). These Ly5.2 positive cells differentiated into all lineages, as determined by proportions of Mac-1, B-220, CD3 and Ter119 positive populations. Currently, we are enumerating the expansion of HOXB4 transduced HSCs in p21 deficient BM cells using the CRU assay. Our findings suggest that HOXB4 increases the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells by a mechanism that is independent of p21. In addition, the findings demonstrate that deficiency of p21 in combination with enforced expression of HOXB4 can be used to rapidly and effectively expand hematopoietic stem cells.",
