    "abstract_text": "Abstract 914 Cell cycle regulators could be differentially used among self\u2013renewing stem cells, rapidly expanding progenitor cells, and terminally differentiated cells those clonally replicate. Cyclin A is a regulatory subunit for cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk) 1 and Cdk2, and it drives S phase progression as well as transition to G2/M phase in cell cycle. We have previously reported that cyclin A2 is not required for fibroblast replication but it is indispensable in maintenance of self-renewing stem cells, including embryonic stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (Cell 138 2009). The question is whether cyclin A2 plays a role in proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors downstream of the HSC. Here, we further assessed the requirement of cyclin A2 in non-self-renewing hematopoietic progenitors. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that cyclin A2 was expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells as well as stem cells, and its expression level is highest in lymphoid-committed progenitor stages of both T and B cell lineages. Thus, in order to test the role of cylin A2 in early lymphopoiesis, we crossed cyclin A2 floxed mice with Rag1-Cre knock-in mice. Because recombination activating gene (RAG)-1 is essential for generation of pre-BCRs and pre-TCRs that are critical for expansion of B and T lymphoid progenitor cells, respectively, we hypothesized that the requirement of Cyclin A2 in early lymphopoiesis can be assessed in this system. As we expected, the Rag1-Cre cyclin A2 floxed/floxed mice were viable, and have normal numbers of HSCs and myeloid progenitors. They, however, displayed severe reduction of mature T and B cell numbers that were only 1/100 - 1/10 of wild-type controls. The number of common lymphoid progenitor was unchanged, but there were severely reduced preB cells in bone marrow and T cell progenitors from CD4-CD8- double negative stage in thymus. Furthermore, cell cycle analysis shows that the Cyclin A2 disrupted progenitors are unable to progress from S to G2/M phase, and in vitro culture clearly showed that those progenitors are unable to proliferate and resulted in apoptosis. These findings clearly demonstrate that cyclin A2 is indispensable not only for self-renewing HSCs, but also for proliferation of T and B cell progenitors.
