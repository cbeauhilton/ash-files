    "abstract_text": "AML with t(8;16)(p11;p13) is an infrequent leukemia subtype with characteristic clinical-biological features. The t(8;16)(p11;p13) translocation leads to the fusion of MYST3 and CREBBP genes, probably resulting in a disturbed transcriptional program of a myelo-monocytic precursor. In this study, the genetic signature of MYST3-CREBBP AML was compared with other well-defined AML subtypes. Genotypic analyses using oligonucleotide U133A arrays (Affymetrix) were performed on RNA of 23 AML patients, including three MYST3-CREBBP cases, PML-RARa (n=3), RUNX1-CBF2T1 (n=3), CBF \u03b2 -MYH11 (n=3), t(9;11)/ AF9-MLL (n=1), monocytic AML (FAB M4/M5), n=8, and two cases of AML with multilineage dysplasia. Forty-six genes differentially expressed in MYST3-CREBBP cases were analyzed by multiple real-time RT-PCR using low-density arrays in an additional series of 40 patients, which included 7 MYST3-CREBBP cases, 18 AML samples with well characterized rearrangements ( PML-RARa, n=3; RUNX1-CBF2T1, n=3; CBF \u03b2 -MYH11, n=3 , MLL- rearranged AML, n=9), and 15 patients with normal karyotype AML. After unsupervised analysis, MYST3-CREBBP cases clustered together, displaying a distinctive expression signature. The analysis by RT-PCR confirmed the gene expression pattern found in the high-density array study. Thus, overexpressed genes included oncogene RET , several homeobox ( HOXA9, HOXA10 ), genes involved in apoptosis ( DAP) and prolactin gene. In contrast, cyclinD2, STAT5A , STAT5B and WT1 were underexpressed. Interestingly, MYST3-CREBBP cases showed up-regulation of a subgroup of genes ( HOXA9, MEIS1, AKR7A2 , CHD3, FLT3 and APBA2) that were also found overexpressed in MLL- rearranged leukemias. In summary, this study showed the distinctive genetic signature of MYST3-CREBBP AML, which harbours some similarities with MLL -rearranged AML. In addition, the low-density array methodology validated the results of the microarray analysis and allowed to study a larger series of patients, including samples not suitable for microarray analysis.",
