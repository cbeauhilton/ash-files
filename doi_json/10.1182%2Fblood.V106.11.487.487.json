    "abstract_text": "The majority of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) are over 60 years of age, yet many are denied potentially curative high-dose regimens due to concerns of excessive toxicity with stem cell transplantation in this age group. Myeloablative anti-CD20 radioimmunotherapy (RIT) can deliver curative radiation doses to tumor sites while limiting exposure to normal organs and may be ideal for older adults requiring high-dose therapy. We have treated 24 patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL aged \u226560 years using high-dose I-131-tositumomab (GlaxoSmithKline) and ASCT on a phase II trial. Patients were required to have a performance status of 0\u20131, acceptable organ function, \u22652x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg collected, and 1 extranodal site = 21%, elevated LDH at treatment = 46%, IPI score at transplant 3\u20135 = 46%, Histology: diffuse large B-cell (DLBCL)=9 pts (with 4/9 transformed from follicular lymphoma [FL]), mantle cell (MCL)=8 pts, FL=6 pts, and marginal zone (MZL) 1 pt. The median I-131 activity administered was 525 mCi (range 328\u20131154 mCi) with dose limiting organs being lung, liver, and kidney in 12, 8, and 4 patients, respectively. The therapy was well tolerated with no treatment-related deaths, and no grade 3\u20134 Bearman toxicity. NCI CTC non-hematopoeitic toxicities by day 100 included: Grade 4=2/24 and Grade 3=17/24. The median time after ASCT for recovery of platelets > 20K and neutrophils >500 was 10 and 15 days, respectively. Sixteen of 24 pts remain alive (67%) and 10 (42%) are alive and progression-free with a median follow up from ASCT of 2.2 yrs (range 1 mo.\u20134.9 yrs.) for survivors. The estimated 3-year overall and progression-free survival are 56% and 37%, respectively. Surviving patients include 6/8 with MCL, 5/7 with FL/MZL, and 5/9 with DLBCL as well as 9/13 with chemoresistant disease. Myeloablative I-131-tositumomab with ASCT is a well-tolerated and effective transplant option for older adults with high-risk, relapsed B-NHL, though longer follow-up and additional pts will be needed to confirm the reproducibility and durability of these findings.",
