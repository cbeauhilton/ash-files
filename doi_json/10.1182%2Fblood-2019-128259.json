    "abstract_text": "Background : Case management (CM) and community health workers (CHWs) are two evidence-based health management strategies that can help reduce health risks, reduce readmission rates, and improve patient-provider relationships, all of which may be suboptimal in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). In Fiscal Year (FY) 2016, the actual average vs. expected average length of stay (ALOS) among SCD adults at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center (VCU), an urban academic medical center, was 6.7 days vs 4.2 days. The 30-day readmission rate was 33.7%. We have previously presented results of a year-long pilot CM and CHW intervention for five of VCU's highest adult SCD utilizers, measured by calendar year (CY) 2015 VCU charges (Sop, et al., Blood 2017). Comparing CYs 2015 and 2016, there were numeric improvements in inpatient discharges, 30-day readmissions, 3-Day Emergency Department (ED) returns, ED discharges, outpatient visits, inpatient days, and total VCU charges. Herein, we show results of an extension of the pilot to evaluate responsivity to change over time: whether these improvements were lost among these same patients in the subsequent year (CY 2017) with diminished CM due to loss of funding, and whether they recurred in CY 2018, when CM was more robust as a result of new, more stable funding. Methods : Using the VCU charge and utilization database, we compared the above utilization variables for the five highest CY 2015 utilizers in CYs 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The five original patients included 2 males and 3 females aged between 25-31 years old. One of the females passed away in 2016. Results : There was a trend toward numerically lower utilization during the two CM and CHW years (2016 and 2018), compared to the two diminished CM years (2015 and 2017). Inpatient discharges, inpatient days, and total charges see-sawed according to the intensity of intervention, going down during the year of the initial intervention, rising during the year after intervention, and going down again with resumption of intervention. However, there were notable exceptions: 30-day re-admissions were the lowest in 2017 a diminished intervention year; 3-day ED returns were flat throughout; ED discharges declined throughout, and; outpatient visits rose throughout. Conclusions: These pilot results must be interpreted with caution, since the sample was very small, and interventions were not standardized or randomized, so that secondary trends could be excluded. We found that, after diminution in 2017 of an initial CM and CHW intervention in 2016, several of the initial 2015-to-2016 improvements in academic medical center utilization for five high-utilizing adult SCD patients deteriorated. Subsequently, these improvements recurred when CM and CHWs were reapplied in 2018. We also found that other utilization improvements were sustained despite diminution or resumption of the intervention.
