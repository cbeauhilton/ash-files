    "abstract_text": "Background: Exposure of cancer cells to BET-BRD protein inhibitors has been associated with a significant downregulation of C-MYC expression, leading to suppression of the transcriptional program linked to proliferation and survival. C-MYC mRNA expression, mediated by STAT5 activation, is induced by the JAK2 (V617F) mutation (JAK2mu) in transfected BA/F3 cells (Funakoshi-Tago, et al. 2013). We selected JAK2mu leukemia-derived cell lines for preclinical evaluation of OTX015 (Oncoethix, Switzerland), a selective orally-bioavailable inhibitor of BET-BRD proteins with promising early results in an ongoing phase I study in hematologic malignancies (Herait et al, AACR 2014, NCT01713582). Material and Methods: Antiproliferative effects of OTX015 and JQ1 were evaluated in three established JAK2mu human myeloid leukemia cell lines (SET2, MUTZ8, HEL 92.1.7). GI50 (OTX015 concentration inducing 50% growth inhibition) and Emax (% cell proliferation at 6 \u00b5M OTX015) values were determined by MTT assay after 72h exposure. Protein levels were analyzed by Western blot, and RT-PCR was performed with Fast SYBR Green Master Mix on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System. For cell cycle analysis, cells were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer. Induction of apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin-V. Simultaneous schedules of OTX015 combined with ruxolitinib, a JAK2 inhibitor, were evaluated. Combination index (CI) was determined using the Chou & Talalay method; CI1 antagonism. Results: After 72h exposure, SET2 was the most sensitive cell line (GI50=0.12 \u00b5M and Emax=15%), and HEL92.1.7 cells had a GI50=1.9 \u00b5M with an Emax=23%. MUTZ8 was the most resistant cell line with an Emax=61%. Similar GI50 and Emax values are observed with JQ1. A significant increase in the fraction of apoptotic cells was observed in SET2 cells after 72h 500 nM OTX015 exposure. Non-significant increases in Annexin-positive cells were seen in HEL92.1.7 and MUTZ8 cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed a significant increase in the percentage of SET2 cells in subG0/G1 after 24, 48, and 72h 500 nM OTX015, correlating with the increase in apoptosis. Conversely, an increase in the percent cells in the G1 phase was observed in HEL 92.1.7 cells. After 4h 500 nM OTX015, BRD2 mRNA levels were significantly increased in all three cell lines, whereas BRD3 levels were not modified. BRD4 mRNA levels increased significantly after 48h in SET2 cells. OTX015 treatment induced a transitory reduction of C-MYC mRNA levels after 4h with an increase at 24h in all cell lines. At the protein level, C-MYC decreased substantially in SET2 cells after 4h, with complete disappearance after 48h without recovery, while in the less sensitive MUTZ8 cell line, the decrease in C-MYC protein levels was transitory. Conversely, this proto-oncogene was not modified in HEL92.1.7 cells. In addition, p-STAT5 protein was downregulated by OTX015 in SET2 cells, but was increased in MUTZ8 cells after longer exposure time. Furthermore, BCL2 mRNA and protein levels decreased in SET2 cells, correlating with the apoptosis induction seen with OTX015 treatment. In HEL92.1.7 cells, P21 mRNA levels and cyclin D1 protein levels increased after 4h and 48h OTX015 treatment, respectively. Moreover, concomitant combination of OTX015 with ruxolitinib showed a highly antagonist effect (CI>7) in SET2 cells, the most sensitive cell line to both agents. On the other hand, very strong synergy was observed in HEL92.1.7 (CI=0.19) and MUTZ8 (CI=0.41), despite their low sensitivity to single agent OTX015. Conclusions. Our findings demonstrate that OTX015 exhibits potent activity against cultured leukemic cells expressing the JAK2 V617F mutation, inducing apoptosis or cell cycle arrest at submicromolar concentrations. This activity correlates with modulation of C-MYC, p-STAT5, BCL2, P21 and cyclin D1 mRNA and protein levels following OTX015 treatment. Our study highlights the novel and synergistic activity of the combination of a BRD antagonist and a JAK inhibitor in human leukemic cells harboring the JAK2 V617 F mutation, supporting the rationale for in vivo testing of OTX015 in combination with JAK inhibitors in leukemic JAK2mu models.
