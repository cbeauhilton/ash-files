    "abstract_text": "Activating mutations in colony stimulating factor 3 receptor gene ( CSF3R ) have recently been identified as specific driver mutations in chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL)( NEJM 2013;368:1781 ). We sought to outline the clinical and laboratory characteristics and natural history of this molecularly defined entity. Methods : An IRB- approved retrospective analysis of all cases of CSF3R -mutated WHO-defined CNL was undertaken. Methods of mutation analysis have been previously published. ( Leukemia 2013; 27: 1870 ) Results : From 10/1995 to 3/2013, fourteen patients (median age 67 years; 57% male) with CSF3R -mutated CNL were evaluated at the Mayo Clinic. Most of the CSF3R mutations identified occurred in isolation: T618I ( n =11), M696T ( n =2) and I598I SYN ( n =1), although one T618I mutant patient also carried a cytoplasmic domain mutation (2341_2342 insC ). All patients were BCR/ABL negative. Five carried a SETBP1 mutation: G870D ( n =2), D868N ( n =2) and G872R ( n =1), all of whom carried the T618I mutation. Only one of 10 tested carried a CALR mutation (E398D) and none of 13 the JAK2 V617F mutation. Apart from fatigue, most patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis and leukocytosis had been mostly an incidental laboratory finding. Ten (71%) patients had preceding chronic leukocytosis, median duration 12.5 months (range 5-84), 5 reported weight loss, which was accompanied by fevers/ sweats in 3. Five (36%) patients had prior exposures to adjuvant chest wall irradiation for breast cancer ( n =2), radioiodine for thyroid disease ( n =2) and methotrexate/cyclophosphamide for autoimmune disease ( n =2). Five (36%) patients had palpable splenomegaly. Peripheral blood (PB) parameters, median (range) at diagnosis were: Hb 10.8 g/dl (8.5-16.0), WBC: 54 x 10(9)/L (21.7-176.2), platelets: 201 x 10(9)/L (25-476), neutrophils: 85% (78-94), immature cells (myelocytes + metamyelocytes): 6% (0-11) and monocytes: 3% (0-10). Neutrophils had toxic granulation and Dohle Bodies in 71% of cases. LDH was elevated in all patients: 354 U/L (225-496). None had a monoclonal protein. The bone marrow (BM) was hypercellular in all patients: 95% (80-100%) and granulocytic precursors were markedly increased with left-shifted (n=11) or normal maturation. BM blasts were < 5%. Reticulin fibrosis was absent ( n =5), 1+ ( n =5) or 1-2+ ( n =1) in those with staining. Cytogenetics were normal in all but one at diagnosis. One patient was lost to follow up after diagnosis. Hydroxyurea (HU) was the most frequently used therapy (initial therapy in 10 patients) and was ultimately received by all. Although initially effective at controlling leukocytosis, clinical course of most was defined by progressive refractory mature neutrophilia with the development of red cell ( n =6) and platelet transfusion ( n =3) dependancy. Other therapies included IFN or PEG/IFN ( n =4), hypomethylating agents ( n =4), ruxolitinib ( n =2), thalidomide ( n =2), cladribine ( n =2) and imatinib ( n =1). None of these additional drugs, induced remission and they provided primarily palliative and transient benefit. One patient transformed into AML at 17 months, one received induction chemotherapy for suspected AML (PB and BM blasts at 11-13%) at 19 months and two evolved into WHO-defined CMML, at 20 and 27 months, respectively. Both patients with documented/suspected AML were both T618I and SETBP1 positive. Of the cases progressing to CMML (one with T618I, one with M696T) neither was SETBP1 positive. At last follow up, eight patients had died and median survival was 22.5 months. Progressive refractory neutrophilic leukocytosis often preceded and contributed to death. Four (29%) patients are currently alive after a median follow-up of 61 months (14.3- 69.4). Conclusion : CSF3R- mutated CNL is an aggressive disease (median survival <2 years) characterized by progressive neutrophilic leukocytosis which is only partially controlled with current drugs, including the putative targeted therapy ruxolitinib (both ruxolitinib-treated patients progressed on treatment). Patients with CNL could progress into AML or CMML; however, most succumb from complications associated with progressive treatment-refractory leukocytosis. The observation that both patients with documented/suspected AML were SETBP1 -mutation positive suggests potential pathogenetic link. Disclosures Off Label Use: Ruxolitinib, cladribine, thalidomideand inteferon. These drugs were used in a historical account of CNL and I report on these in a retrospective chart review only..",
