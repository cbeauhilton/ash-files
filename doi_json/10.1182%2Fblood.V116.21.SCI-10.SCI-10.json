    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-10 Recent genome-wide association scans published by ours and other groups have revealed > 50 genetic loci associated with hematological parameters, including the count and volume of red and white blood cells and platelets. These variants map to known and novel regulators of hematopoiesis, and provide evidence for a high degree of connectivity guiding differentiation of the different blood elements. I will review progress in the field as well as ongoing efforts within the HaemGen consortium, where we have used statistical analyses, animal models and genome-wide functional annotation to address the in-depth genetic exploration of such parameters.
