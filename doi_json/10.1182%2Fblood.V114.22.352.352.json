    "abstract_text": "Abstract 352 We present updated results from MRC Myeloma IX study evaluating the role of the addition of thalidomide to the induction and maintenance of patients with myeloma. The study ran from May 2003 \u2013 November 2007 and randomised 1,970 patients and now has a median follow up of more than 3.5 years giving it improved power to detect changes in outcome developing later after treatment. Projected median OS younger fitter patients 66 months, median OS older less fit patients 32 months. The trial comprised of 2 patient pathways, one for younger fitter patients comparing CTD (cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, dexamethasone) with CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, dexamethasone), all patients going on to receive an ASCT \u2013 median age 59 years. In older less fit patients, melphalan and prednisolone (MP) was compared to CTD attenuated \u2013 median age 73 years. In both pathways following initial treatment, eligible patients were randomised to low-dose thalidomide or no maintenance. Patient's response was monitored using electrophoresis, serum free light chain and multiparameter flow cytometry. Cytogenetics was availabel on up to 60% of cases and gene expression on a subset of these. CTD is a well tolerated regimen with a good safety profile giving excellent survivals in both groups of patients despite a small increase in risk of VTE. Using modified EBMT criteria, the addition of thalidomide to induction treatment increases both response rates and depth of response for all age groups. Preliminary results as follows: overall response: CTD vs CVAD: 91% v 82%; CR 21% v 14% and 100 days post-HDM, better responses were seen in CTD with CR rates 65% v 48%. Remission depth was also greater in CTD with more patients achieving minimal residual disease negativity by flow cytometry. The addition of thalidomide increases response rates overall, and particularly complete response (CR) rates (a 17% increase in CR rates post HDM, p=.006). In older/less fit patients CTDa vs MP: overall response 83% v 46%; CR 21% v 4%. Definitive results of these analyses will be presented as well as how they translate into PFS and OS and by cytogenetic subgroup. There is a substantial increase in response with the inclusion of thalidomide but at a median follow-up of three years we are not as yet seeing a substantial increase in survival in either of the two broad patient groups. We have collected data on treatment at relapse to explore how this confounds OS data. Importantly modelling analyses indicate when and to what extent, with further follow-up, the survival differences that should accrue from this increase in CR rate are likely to translate into a survival benefit. These results have a number of important implications. We show the benefit of the addition of thalidomide to myeloma treatment but also highlight the importance of later analysis of such trials because of the emergence of significant changes at these later time points. We will present full updated results from the study including the impact of thalidomide on cytogenetic subgroups and in the maintenance setting.
