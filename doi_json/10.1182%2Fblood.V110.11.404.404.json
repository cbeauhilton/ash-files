    "abstract_text": "Regulation of the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin by tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is critical in the control of fibrin deposition. While several plasminogen activators have been described, soluble plasma cofactors that stimulate fibrinolysis have not been characterized. Here, we report that the abundant plasma glycoprotein, \u03b2 2 -glycoprotein I (\u03b2 2 GPI), stimulates t-PA - dependent plasminogen activation both in the fluid phase and within a fibrin gel. Moreover, depletion of \u03b2 2 GPI from plasma reduced the lysis of fibrin thrombi, and exogenous \u03b2 2 GPI enhanced the activity of t-PA in a rat arteriovenous shunt thrombosis model. \u03b2 2 GPI bound t-PA with high affinity (K d \u223c 20 nM), and caused a 20-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency (k cat /K m ) of t-PA - mediated conversion of Glu-plasminogen to plasmin, primarily by stimulating t-PA amidolytic activity. Structure-function analysis revealed that the region within \u03b2 2 GPI responsible for stimulating t-PA activity is at least partially contained within \u03b2 2 GPI domain V. Finally, stimulation of t-PA - mediated plasminogen activity by \u03b2 2 GPI was inhibited by monoclonal anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibodies, as well as by anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibodies from patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). These findings suggest that \u03b2 2 GPI may be an endogenous regulator of fibrinolysis. Impairment of \u03b2 2 GPI-stimulated fibrinolysis by anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibodies may contribute to the development of thrombosis in patients with APS.",
