Many western studies report the incidence of common chimeric fusion transcripts as 30\u201335%, however the data regarding the Indian patients is very scarce. Aims and Objectives: The aim of the present study was to detect presence of common chimeric fusion transcripts of t(12;21), t(9;22), t(1;19) and t(4;11) in adult and pediatric ALL cases using the Multiplex RT-PCR assay. Materials and Methods: This prospective study included 100 consecutive ALL cases diagnosed during last one year; 54 patients were <12 years of age. Diagnosis of ALL was made on the basis of bone marrow (BM) examination and flowcytometric immunophenotypic (FCM-IP) analysis. Approximately 2 ml of peripheral blood (PB) sample or 0.5 ml of BM sample was collected in EDTA. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis was performed using commercial kits, according to standard protocols. RT-PCR assay was carried out using primers specific to the fusion transcripts of TEL-AML1 t(12;21); BCR-ABL t(9;22); E2A-PBX t(1;19) and MLL-AF4 t(4;11). The results of RT-PCR and FCM-IP were blinded and compared later. Results: Out of the 100 cases enrolled in the study, 54% were pediatric and 46% adult cases. Among the pediatric ALL cases, 49 were diagnosed as B-lineage ALL, 3 T-lineage ALL and 2 Biphenotypic ALL. Whereas among the adult ALL cases, 30 were diagnosed as B-lineage ALL, 12 T-lineage ALL and 4 Biphenotypic ALL. A total of 26% showed positivity for various fusion transcripts: 13% each pediatric and adult cases being positive. Of the 12 positive pediatric B-lineage ALL cases, 8 were positive for TEL-AML1 transcripts, 1 for BCR-ABL transcripts, 1 for E2A-PBX transcripts and 2 for MLL-AF4 transcripts. Out of the 11 positive adult cases, 7 were positive for BCR-ABL transcripts, 2 were positive for TEL-AML1 transcripts and 1 each for E2A-PBX transcripts and MLL-AF4 transcripts. BCR-ABL transcripts were detected in 1 out of 2 pediatric biphenotypic ALL and 2 out of 4 adult biphenotypic ALL cases. None of the pediatric cases was positive for the MLL-AF4 transcripts. None of the 4 transcripts were detected in any T-lineage ALL. Conclusion: Results of our study are comparable to those of other western and Asian studies, with TEL-AML1 transcripts being the most common fusion transcripts seen in pediatric B-ALL cases and BCR-ABL in adult cases. However two Indian studies had reported much lower incidence of TEL-AML1 and MLL-AF4 transcript in B-ALL cases. Identification of good prognostic groups and rationalization of therapy assumes great importance in our set ups as many patients are economically under-privileged. Relationship of these transcripts to the prognosis of our ALL patients will be evaluated in future. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
