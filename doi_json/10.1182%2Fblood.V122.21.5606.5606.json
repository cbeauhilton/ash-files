    "abstract_text": "Background Myeloma patients have experienced great survival benefits in the last decade due to the use of novel agents and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Prior studies report a complex interplay between payer status and the receipt of ASCT. We have evaluated if the payer status affects outcome metrics of length of stay (LOS), in-hospital mortality rate (IHM),\u00a0 and total hospitalization charges in the context of survival benefit of myeloma with this procedure. Methods We used the NIS (Nationwide Inpatient Sample) 2001-2010 database (part of the HCUP database) to obtain the patient data. \u00a0Using private insurance as the reference group, we performed multivariate logistic regression to understand the association of payer status with LOS, IHM, hospitalization charges. We adjusted our model for age, race and the presence or absence of co-morbidities. Comorbidites were identified using comorbidity software that created measures reported by Elixhauser et al. Results From 01/2001 until 12/2010, 25656 admissions for ASCT as principal procedure for the principal diagnosis of multiple myeloma were included in our analysis. The IHM rate during this period based on payer status was 3.04%, 1.56%, 1.20% and 0.4% for medicare, medicaid, private insurance and others, respectively. Median LOS for medicaid and medicare were 17 days while private insurance and other insurances had a median LOS of 16 days. Medicare patients undergoing ASCT had higher likelihood of IHM compared to private insurance [Odds ratio: 2.62 ( 95%CI 1.46 \u2013 4.72)]; while medicaid patients had non-significant increase. LOS in medicaid patients was longer compared to private insurance [(Odds ratio: 1.53 ( 95%CI 1.16-2.02)]. Conclusion Myeloma patients with medicare undergoing ASCT had higher likelihood of in-hospital death compared to patients with private insurance. Medicaid patients had a lengthier in-hospital stay but there seems to be no significant difference in hospitalization charges in the different payer groups. However, the acceptable overall cumulative mortality rate suggests that myeloma patients can continue to enjoy the survival benefits associated with ASCT despite payer status. Further studies evaluating long-term outcomes outside the hospital admission would be required to better understand the association of payer status with overall survival benefits of ASCT.
