    "abstract_text": "Acquired marrow failure syndromes may globally affect all hematopoietic lineages, as in aplastic anemia (AA), or may selectively involve single lineages, as in pure red cell (PRCA) or in pure white cell aplasias (PWCA). Because of their common cellular immune-mediated pathophysiology, standard treatment for these conditions includes immunosuppression (IS), which may differ according to the specific disease. We investigated an experimental IS regimen based on the anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab (MabCampath\u00ae, ALE); the study included a phase II/III prospective trial, as well as a collection of retrospective cases. A total of 32 patients have been treated by ALE (18 SAA, 10 PRCA and 4 PWCA), fourteen of them (mostly PRCA) having not received previous IS. The most utilized schedule (as defined in the prospective trial) was 3,10,30,30,30 mg (total dose 103), administered subcutaneously in consecutive days, with adequate premedication; the last dose was amended in PRCA and PWCA patients (total dose 73 mg). In the prospective trial, all patients also received oral low dose cyclosporine A (1 mg/kg) from day 7, and an intensive anti-infectious prophylaxis, which included oral valgancyclovir and cotrimoxazol. All patients completed the treatment with unrelevant injection-related side effect (fever and/or rash in some cases) and absence of laboratory abnormalities. Complete lympho-ablation was observed in all patients within 2\u20133 days, which persisted for several weeks; transient worsening of neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia were observed in some cases. The median follow up was 12 months; there were 5 deaths, only one was possibly related to the treatment. In the prospective trial (n=23), infectious events were rare: a single FUO, associated with fatal complication of an underlying atrial fibrillation, other four viral infections (1 VZV with shingles, 2 HSV and 1 flu), all resolving quickly. No CMV or EBV disease was observed, even if 3 border-line CMV reactivations were documented (after discontinuation of the antiviral prophylaxis), promptly resolved by preemptive valganciclovir. One HBV reactivation without hepatitis required lamivudine. The response rate was globally 61% (42% CR and 19% PR), which raised to 73% (50% CR and 23% PR) when only patients with a follow up of at least 4 months were considered. In the more homogeneous cohort of the prospective trial, response rate was analyzed according to the underlying disease. Among 10 AA treated (5 as first line), 7 had an adequate follow up and showed 4 CR (57%) and 2 PR (29%). Response rate was even higher in 10 PRCA (8 as first line): 7 were evaluable for response, with 5 CR (71%) and 1 PR (14%); the 1 non responding patient subsequently showed evolution to MDS. Finally, 2 of 3 PWCA achieved a CR (66%), with the remaining showing early progression to MDS. Among the responding patients, relapses were quite frequent, even while on cyclosporine: 3/6 SAAs, 5/6 PRCAs and 1/2 PWCA. Relapses were successfully treated by additional ALE (as single shoots or complete courses). Immune reconstitution was delayed up to several months, especially affecting the CD4+ compartment; this was also due to additional ALE needed to treat or to prevent relapses. In conclusion, subcutaneous ALE is a feasible and safe IS regimen for patients suffering from immune-mediated marrow failure syndromes. Preliminary results suggest excellent efficacy, even if responses may be quite late (3\u20134 months); relapses often occur, but can be easily managed by ALE retreatment. ALE is an excellent alternative to standard IS regimen, and deserves systematic investigation in bone marrow failure patients.",
