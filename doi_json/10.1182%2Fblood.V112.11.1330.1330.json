    "abstract_text": "Alkylphosphocholines are promising new drugs for cancer treatment. They kill cancer cells by evoking multiple signaling pathways: Interference with phospholipid turnover and lipid signaling, Induction of stress signaling (SAPK/JNK) and apoptosis, Inhibition of survival and proliferation pathways (PI3K/AKT, MEK/ERK). We have investigated the therapeutic potential of the novel alkylphosphocholine, erucylphosphohomocholine (ErPC 3 ), on human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells. At variance with other alkylphosphocholines, such as perifosine, ErPC 3 can be administered i.v. as it does not cause hemolysis. ErPC 3 was tested on THP-1 cells (which display activation of both PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways), and on HL60 and NB4 cell lines (which only have MEK/ERK activation), as well as primary AML cells. THP-1, HL60, and NB4 cells have a non-functional p53 pathway. At short (6 h) incubation times, the drug blocked AML cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle, whereas at longer incubation times (24 hr), it decreased survival and induced cell death by apoptosis. The IC 50 for ErPC 3 with THP-1 cells was 5.0 \u03bcM, whereas with HL60 and NB4 cells it was 10.0 \u03bcM. In THP-1 cells, ErPC 3 caused Akt dephosphorylation on Ser 473 and Thr 308, however it also downregulated total Akt expression levels. Downregulation of total Akt levels was blocked by a caspase-3 inhibitor. At 3 \u03bcM ErPC 3 , induced a complete dephosphorylation of ERK 1/2, whereas a sizable MEK1 dephosphorylation was seen only at 10 \u03bcM. The protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid blocked ERK 1/2 dephosphorylation induced by ErPC 3 , suggesting dephosphorylation was due to increased phosphatase activity. ErPC 3 activated JNK 2 (54- kDa), and a JNK 1/2 peptide inhibitor markedly reduced ErPC 3 -elicited apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. ErPC 3 did not significantly affect the expression of proteins which are involved in mitochondrial control of apoptosis, including Bax, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, AIF, Bcl2, p-Bcl2, and survivin. Only Puma expression was downregulated. ErPC 3 activated apical caspases \u22122, \u22128, \u22129, and \u221210, as well as the executioner caspase\u22123. Pharmacological inhibitors of either caspase\u22123 or \u22129 completely blocked ErPC 3 -induced apoptotic cell death. ErPC 3 synergized with etoposide (CI:0.16), doxorubicin (CI: 0.48), and mitoxantrone (CI: 0.33) when the drugs were administered together. In contrast, when the chemotherapeutic drugs were administered prior to ErPC 3 , synergism was detected with mitoxantrone (CI: 0.67) and etoposide (CI: 0.15), whereas combinations with doxorubicin resulted in antagonism (CI:1.71). If ErPC 3 was administered prior to the chemotherapeutic drugs, synergism was detected with doxorubicin (CI: 0.79) and etoposide (CI: 0.40), but not with mitoxantrone (CI: 1.41). Moreover, ErPC 3 was cytotoxic for AML blasts with activated PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways (IC 50 : 10 \u03bcM at 72 h) and for AML primary cells with only activation of MEK/ERK signaling (IC 50 : 13 \u03bcM at 72 h). Remarkably, ErPC 3 induced a significant apoptosis (30\u201340%) of primary blast cells, especially in the compartment (CD34 + , CD38 Low/Neg , CD123 + ) enriched in putative leukemic stem cells. This observation was also supported by the cytotoxic effects of ErPC 3 on AML blasts displaying high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. ErPC 3 also reduced the clonogenic activity of CD34 + cells from AML patients displaying constitutive PI3K/Akt and/or MEK/ERK upregulation, but not CD34 + cells from healthy donors. Our findings indicate that ErPC3, either alone or in combination with existing drugs, is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of those AML cases characterized by upregulation of the PI3K/Akt and/or MEK/ERK survival pathways, even in the absence of a functional p53."
