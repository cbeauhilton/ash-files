    "abstract_text": "Our aim was to identify pre-transplant variables affecting the outcome of submyeloablative HSCT in 63 patients (27\u201366 y, median 52) with NHL/Hodgkin/CLL (n=29), acute leukemia (n=19), and myeloma (n=15). Donors were HLA-matched sibs (n=37), 10/10 allele-matched unrelated (n=19), or 1-locus/allele mismatched (n=7). The conditioning was 100 mg/m 2 melphalan with (n=42; no prior auto) or without (n=21; prior auto) 50 mg/kg cyclophosphamide. GVHD prophylaxis comprised cyclosporine-mycophenolate (HLA-matched sibs) or tacrolimus-mycophenolate (others). G/GM-CSF were not used. Supportive care was uniform. 16 patients died of transplant-related causes (TRM), and 35 relapsed (8 alive after salvage therapy). Of the variables analyzed in univariate fashion for effect on OS, the following were found to be significant and were entered into a Cox model for TRM, relapse, EFS and OS: age (83% 45 y), 10 8 /kg CD3+ cells infused (49% 3), and hemoglobin (24% 45 (RR 2.7; P=0.007), and TRM higher with PS \u22652 (RR 22.7 vs PS 0; P=0.001), donor age >45 (RR 5.3; P=0.013) and increased LDH (RR 8.6; P=0.003).

These data will allow better prediction of outcome in patients proposed to be treated with this regimen, and suggest that modification of therapy is needed for patients with \u22653 adverse variables to improve survival.",
