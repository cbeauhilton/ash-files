    "abstract_text": "Approximately 40% of patients (pts) with newly diagnosed (AML) either fail to achieve complete remission with intensive induction therapy or experience disease recurrence after a short remission duration (< 6 months) . These pts, herein considered to have primary refractory disease, are an extremely challenging population to treat, with only 14% achieving remission following conventional chemotherapy and with subsequent salvage attempts being nearly universally ineffective (1) . Increased immune infiltration of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and high CD123 expression on AML blasts have been associated with primary induction failure and poor prognosis (2, 3). Flotetuzumab (FLZ), a CD123 x CD3 bispecific DART molecule, is currently being tested in a phase 1/2 study in pts with either relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML. We have previously reported FLZ activity in primary refractory AML (4); herein, we provide additional scientific rationale supporting the investigation of FLZ in this patient population. The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of FLZ identified in an ongoing Phase 1/2 study is 500 ng/kg/day administered as a 7 -day/week continuous infusion. Pts receive a lead-in dose during week (W) 1, followed by 500 ng/kg/day during W2-4 of Cycle 1, and a 4-day on/3-day off schedule for Cycle 2 and beyond. Disease status was assessed by modified IWG criteria\u037e bone marrow (BM) samples were collected to investigate biomarkers, including CD123 receptor density (RD), and gene expression profiling using the NanoString PanCancer IO 360\u2122 panel, which measures the expression of 770 genes, including 14 immune cell types and 32 immuno-oncology biological signatures. Gene expression comparisons are presented at fold change (FC) and a t-test was used for statistical analysis. Fifty pts with R/R AML received FLZ at the RP2D. Thirty (60%) pts had primary refractory AML: 24 failed \u22652 induction attempts and 6 recurred after remission of <6 months (median duration of remission 32 [range: 29-45] days). This population was heavily pretreated (median 4 previous lines of therapy [range 2-9]), with 40% (12/30) having secondary AML and most having non-favorable cytogenetic risk (60% adverse and 23% intermediate by ELN 2017 risk category). Compared to relapsed pts, those with primary refractory disease had greater CD123 expression on AML blasts (11277\u00b13246 vs 6254\u00b11779 sites/cell), with baseline BM samples showing higher inflammatory chemokine signature scores (1.7x increase, p=0.018), and an enhanced interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) signaling gene expression score (1.85x increase, p=0.014), a signature associated with resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy (2). Among 28 primary refractory pts evaluable for disease assessment, FLZ complete remission (CR) rate was 32.1% (3 CR, 3 CRh, 3 CRi). Four pts (1 CR, 1CRh, and 2 CRi) subsequently underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. For comparison, the expected CR rate to conventional salvage therapy in this population was calculated as <10%, estimated based on historical response rates of pts subjected to similar numbers and types of salvage therapies (1, 5). Pts with CR showed higher CD123 RD compared to pts with no response (15186.5 vs 10836.8 sites/cell). FLZ anti-leukemic activity (>30% decrease in BM blasts) was associated with increased baseline immune gene signatures, including significantly higher IFN\u03b3 scores (1.8 FC, p=0.0212; AUROC=0.74), and an increased tumor inflammation signature (TIS) score (1.658 FC, p=0.00827, AUROC=0.847 compared to non-responders. FLZ was well tolerated, with no increased cytokine release syndrome events in primary refractory pts (30% G1, 67% G2, 3% G3) compared to relapse pts (26% G1, 58% G2, 16% G3), notwithstanding the increased CD123 RD in the former. In conclusion, we show that FLZ elicits clinical response in heavily treated patients with poor response rates to primary therapy. We also show that increased IFN\u03b3 signaling gene expression scores in baseline BM appears to associate with response to FLZ therapy. Enrollment has been expanded to further define FLZ's activity specifically in pts with primary refractory AML, and candidate biomarkers to enable identification of pts more likely to respond to FLZ.
