    "abstract_text": "Background: GPIb\u03b1 is a critically important platelet receptor best recognized for its ability to bind vWF and mediate platelet adhesion. In addition, a GP Ib\u03b1 binding site for thrombin has been described and characterized for several decades. However, the physiologic relevance of GPIb\u03b1/thrombin binding has remained elusive. Site-directed mutagenesis has shown that a sulfated GP Ib\u03b1 residue, Tyr 276 , is essential for thrombin binding to GP Ib\u03b1 but not critical for vWF binding. The importance of Tyr 276 was further substantiated in the crystal structure of a GP Ib\u03b1/thrombin complex confirming the sulfated Tyr 276 GP Ib\u03b1 residue directly participates with other neighboring negatively charged residues in establishing a first contact with the anion-binding exosite II of an \u03b1-thrombin molecule. To determine the physiologic relevance, if any, of the GP Ib\u03b1 Tyr 276 residue we generated mice with platelets containing a mutant human GP Ib\u03b1 subunit containing a Tyr 276 to Phe 276 substitution (Y276F) and did comparative studies with mice expressing a normal human (WT) GP Ib\u03b1 subunit. Methods: Mouse colonies expressing the normal or variant GP Ib\u03b1 subunits were established by transgenic technology and bred into a mouse colony devoid of murine GP Ib\u03b1. Surface expression of WT or Y276F GP Ib\u03b1 subunits was measured by flow cytometry. Relevant assays included platelet counts, FeCl 3 -induced thrombus formation, tail bleeding times, hemoglobin content following tail resection (measured as 575 nm absorbance of lysed erythrocytes), and washed platelet aggregation induced by different agonists (fibrillar type I collagen, thrombin, ristocetin, arachidonic acid, and PAR activating peptides). Results: Founder mice were selected with nearly identical levels of surface-expressed WT and Y276F GPIb\u03b1 subunits. Circulating platelet counts were similar between the 2 colonies. Stirred platelet aggregation assays induced by 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 units/ml thrombin, 10 and 20 mg/ml fibrillar collagen, 1.25 mg/ml ristocetin, 0.25 mM arachidonic acid, 100 mM PAR3 activating peptide and 100 mM PAR4 activating peptide revealed no significant differences between WT and Y276F samples. No statistically significant values were obtained in tail bleeding time assays or hemoglobin loss comparing WT and Y276F animals. However, the time required for a reduction in carotid artery blood flow following FeCl 3 injury was significantly prolonged in Y276F animals (10.6\u00b11.6 min vs. 5.8\u00b11.4 min). All WT animals displayed complete occlusion following the initial reduction in blood flow. In contrast, 3 out of 6 Y276F animals did not show complete occlusion and had evidence of fluctuating blood flow suggestive of embolization. Discussion: FeCl 3 injury of the mouse carotid artery revealed an essential role for GP Ib\u03b1 residue Tyr 276 . In contrast, no differences were seen in tail bleeding time assays or in any platelet aggregation assay. These results are suggestive that thrombin binding to human GPIb\u03b1 may be relevant for the pathological development of a thrombus. This conclusion is based on both the failure of some carotid arteries from Y276F animals to fully occlude and our observation that all Y276F animals showed an increased length of time for the reduction of blood flow. The results suggest thrombin binding to GPIb\u03b1 could be significant in terms of enhancing fibrinogen cleavage and therefore stabilizing the development of a platelet-rich thrombus.",
