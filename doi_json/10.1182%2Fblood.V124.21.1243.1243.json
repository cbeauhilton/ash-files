    "abstract_text": "Background . Disease-free survival (DFS) for children with ALL exceeds 80%. Nevertheless, the cure rate can be significantly lower in patients with specific chromosomal translocations, confering poor prognosis. The t(4;11) translocation can be detected in 1-3% of children with ALL and is associated with aggressive clinical course and high risk of treatment failure and relapse. Consequently, patients with t(4;11) may be offered allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in first complete remission (CR), although the role of HSCT in this setting is still unclear. Patients and Methods . Data on children with t(4;11) positive ALL treated with allogeneic HSCT in AIEOP Centers from 1990 to 2013 were retrospectively collected, and the impact of patient- and treatment-related variables on the clinical outcome was evaluated. A total of 72 consecutive children with t(4;11) positive ALL were analyzed; 33 patients were males and 39 female. The median age at diagnosis was 11 months (range, 1.2 months - 15 years). 38 patients (53%) had an age at diagnosis < 12 months (defined as infants) and 22 were younger than 6 months at diagnosis. The median WBC count was 167x10 9 /l. The majority of infants (30 patients) were enrolled into Interfant 99 and 06 protocols, while the 34 children older than 12 months of age were enrolled into AIEOP 95, 2000, R-2006 and 2009 protocols, respectively. 46 children (64%) were transplanted in first CR, 18 (25%) in second CR and the remaining 8 (11%) in a more advanced disease phase. 35 patients received HSCT from a matched unrelated donor (MUD), 28 from a matched family donor (MFD) and 9 from a partially matched family donor (PMFD). TBI was used in 40% of patients, while a busulfan-based conditioning regimen was used in 56% of cases. Results . 5-year overall survival (OS) and DFS were 54% (42-67) and 47% (35-60), respectively. Transplant-related mortality (TRM) and relapse incidence (RI) were 20% (13-33) and 32% (23-46), respectively. DFS by donor type was as follow: MFD 51%, MUD 52% and PMFD 22%, respectively (P = 0.04). TRM by donor type was 20% for MFD, 14% for MUD and 44% for PMFD, respectively (P = 0.03). DFS was 60% for children transplanted in 1 st CR, 30% for patients transplanted in 2 nd CR and 25% for those with more advanced disease (P = 0.002). DFS was 40% for children with an age at diagnosis < 6 months, 46% for those with an age at diagnosis between 6 and 12 months, 40% for the 12-24 months group and 57% for patients with an age at diagnosis > 24 months (P = N.S.). DFS was 61% for children receiving TBI and 39% for those treated with a chemo-based conditioning (P = 0.089). Conclusions . Our analysis suggests that HSCT in first remission is a valid therapeutic option for children with t(4;11) positive ALL. Patients transplanted in 1 st CR, as well as those receiving a TBI-based conditioning regimen, had a better outcome. MFD and MUD transplants were associated with a similar DFS probability.
