    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1899 Allogeneic HSCT is curative for leukemia by virtue of the immune reaction mediated by donor T lymphocytes, but unfortunately, some patients relapse after transplantation. It is reasonable to assume that the selective pressure exerted by donor T lymphocytes can lead to the outgrowth of pre-existing leukemia variants that have lost expression of gene products such as HLA molecules. However, the mechanisms of leukemia relapse in HLA-mismatched HSCT recipients remain largely uninvestigated. A case of leukemia escape from an HLA-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in a recipient of HLA one locus-mismatched BMT is presented. A 24-year-old man with primary refractory T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma received BMT from his HLA-B*51:01-mismatched mother with a T lymphocyte-repleted graft. The preparative regimen consisted of L-PAM and TBI. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and methotrexate. The patient developed acute GVHD involving skin, gut, and liver on day 46 (maximum grade: III on day 53). Acute GVHD was incurable and transitioned to chronic GVHD. The patient relapsed with ascites, a hydrocele, and a subpapillary tumor on day 261. Immunosuppressant therapy was required to control GVHD until his death on day 279. Flow cytometric analysis for each HLA-A, B, or DR locus in the leukemia blasts was performed, and it showed that only the expression of B51 was down-regulated in post-transplant leukemia blasts compared with that in pre-transplant blasts. Ten CTL clones were isolated from the patient's blood on day 56. In a Cr release assay, all isolated CTL clones lysed recipient B-LCL but failed to lyse donor B-LCL. The nucleotide sequences of the uniquely rearranged TCR V\u03b2 gene of each clone indicated that 10 clones had been derived from six independent clones. COS cells transfected with the HLA-B*51:01 cDNA construct clearly stimulated IFN-\u03b3 production by six independent CTL clones (ELISA), and the donor B-LCL transfected with HLA-B*51:01 cDNA were lysed by six CTL clones (Cr release assay), indicating that all clones recognized the B*51:01 molecule as an alloantigen. On the other hand, these data suggest that the CTL response toward the B*51:01 molecule accounted for a majority of the recipient's CTL alloresponse during acute GVHD. The recipient B*51:01 and the donor B*52:01 differed in two amino acids at positions 63 and 67, both of which constitute peptide-binding pockets. We generated four mutated B*51:01 cDNA constructs, Asn63Glu and Phe67Ser , in which individual amino acids were substituted with the corresponding amino acid in B*52:01, and Val194Ile and Ala199Val , in which both amino acids localize outside the positions constituting peptide binding pockets. Stimulation by COS cells transfected with Asn63Glu or Phe67Ser , but not with Val194Ile or Ala199Val , significantly decreased IFN-\u03b3 production by all CTL clones, suggesting that recognition of the HLA-B*51:01 molecule by CTL clones was peptide-dependent. Additionally, CTL clones should recognize certain peptides other than leukemia antigens, because B*51:01 -transfected \u201cCOS cells\u201d stimulated IFN-\u03b3 production of CTLs, and B*51:01 -transfected \u201cdonor B-LCL\u201d were lysed by CTLs. We then attempted to determine that the leukemia blasts escaped from the cytotoxicity of B*51:01-specific CTL clones. The pre-transplant leukemia blasts (purity, \u223c62%) were weakly but clearly lysed by CTL clone, whereas the post-transplant leukemia blasts (\u223c99%) were not lysed by any CTL clones at all. In addition, the IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay was performed to detect the B*51:01-reactive T lymphocytes in patient blood on day 232, one month before clinical leukemia relapse. IFN-\u03b3-producing B*51:01-reactive T lymphocytes were detected at a level nearly equal to the level of recipient B-LCL-reactive T lymphocytes, that is, the total of the T lymphocyte alloresponse. The mechanism of leukemia relapse in this patient can be explained as follows: CTLs specific for HLA-B*51:01 molecule/non-leukemia peptide complexes were generated in the patient blood during acute GVHD, and these CTLs continued to produce immunological pressure on leukemia blasts for at least 8 months after transplantation, but B*51:01-down-regulated leukemia blasts escaped from the pressure of B*51:01-specific CTLs, and then the leukemia clinically relapsed. These findings can explain, at least in part, the mechanism of how leukemia relapse occurs during persistent GVHD after HSCT.
