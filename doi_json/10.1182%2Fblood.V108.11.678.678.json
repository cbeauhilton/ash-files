    "abstract_text": "Many critical features of the organization and regulation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, a complex multi-subunit enzyme that generates superoxide for microbial killing, remain poorly defined. The active enzyme includes a membrane-bound flavocytochrome b along with p47 phox , p67 phox , p40 phox , and Rac-GTP that are present in the cytosol of resting cells. p67 phox is linked by high affinity interactions with both p47 phox and p40 phox , which appear to translocate as a trimeric complex upon cellular activation. The p47 phox subunit acts as an adaptor to promote translocation by docking at a proline-rich target sequence on the flavocytochrome, and p67 phox is a Rac-GTP effector containing a domain that activates electron transport. In contrast, the function of p40 phox , which is not required for high level oxidase activity in cell free systems, is poorly understood. Recently, our group showed that p40 phox plays key role in the activation of superoxide production during phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized targets in COS phox Fc\u03b3R cells. This model cell line contains stable transgenes for the flavocytochrome, p47 phox , p67 phox , and the Fc\u03b3IIA receptor, without or with an additional transgene for p40 phox . p40 phox -dependent coupling of Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis to superoxide production required an intact p40 phox PX domain, which binds to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P), a phosphoinositide generated by class III PI3 kinases in phagosome membranes (Suh et al J Exp Med 203, 1915Suh et al J Exp Med 203, 2006). Furthermore, a newly developed p40 phox -null mouse exhibits reduced neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity in response to selected agonists, including IgG-opsonized targets (Ellson et al J Exp Med 203, 1927Ellson et al J Exp Med 203, 2006). In the current study, we investigated whether p40 phox is required for translocation of p67 phox during phagocytosis. We generated COS phox Fc\u03b3R cells expressing YFP-tagged p67 phox from a stable transgene instead of untagged p67 phox . Following incubation with IgG-opsonized sheep red blood cells (IgG-RBC), p67 phox was detected on phagosome membranes at both early stages of phagosome cup formation and after closure, independent of whether or not p40 phox was also co-expressed. However, NADPH oxidase activity was not detected in IgG-RBC phagosomes in COS phox Fc\u03b3R-p67 phox -YFP cells unless p40 phox was present. PMA-activated superoxide production was independent of p40 phox , and Western blotting indicated there was no significant difference in expression of the other oxidase subunits in COS phox Fc\u03b3R-p67 phox -YFP cells without or with the p40 phox transgene. Further studies in PLB-985 granulocytes expressing stable transgenes for either YFP-tagged p67 phox or p40 phox showed that the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin inhibited phagosome NADPH oxidase activity and translocation of p40 phox , but localization of p67 phox to phagosomes was unaffected. These results indicate that although p40 phox positively regulates NADPH oxidase activation during phagocytosis, recruitment of p67 phox to the phagosome is independent of p40 phox . Taken together, these data suggest that the PX domain of p40 phox acts as a PI3P-dependent switch to activate the membrane-assembled NADPH oxidase complex.",
