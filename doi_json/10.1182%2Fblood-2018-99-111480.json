    "abstract_text": "Background: Persistent polyclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (PPBL) is a rare disorder, occurs almost exclusively in smoking women and is characterized by a chronic polyclonal lymphocytosis with circulating binucleated lymphocytes, clonal cytogenetic abnormalities involving chromosome 3, and chromosomal instability. Outcome of PPBL patients is mostly benign, but subsequent malignancies (non-Hodgkin\u00b4s lymphomas and solid tumors) were described. Potential molecular factors leading to their development are yet unclear. Aims: Detailed molecular genetic characterization of PPBL by whole genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) in comparison to the well-characterized lymphoid malignancy CLL. Patient cohorts and methods: The total cohort comprised 27 PPBL (3 male, 24 female) and 250 CLL cases (163 male, 87 female). WGS was performed for all patients: 150bp paired-end reads where generated on Illumina HiseqX and NovaSeq 6000 machines (Illumina, San Diego, CA). A mixture genomic DNA from multiple anonymous donors was used as normal controls. To remove potential germline variants, each variant was queried against the gnomAD database, variants with global population frequencies >1% where excluded. Final analysis was performed only on protein-altering and splice-site variants. For further analysis, a virtual panel of 355 lymphoid genes was selected. All reported p-values are two-sided and were considered significant at p 5 CPM) in at least 66% of the samples. Genes with FDR (false discovery rate) < 0.05 and an absolute logFC > 1.5 were considered differentially expressed (DE). Results: Median age was 46 years for PPBL patients (range: 23-67 years) and 67 years for CLL patients (range: 39-94 years). Mean number of mutations per patient was 18 for PPBL and 20 for CLL. For both entities, the majority of mutations were missense mutations (88% in PPBL vs. 81% in CLL), followed by splice-site mutations (7% vs. 10%), other mutation types were only rarely detected. In PPBL, 42 genes were found to be mutated at a frequency of >15%, including ATM (22%), CREBBP (19%), NCOR2 (19%), AHNAK2 (15%), JAK3 (15%), NOTCH2 (15%) and TRAF1 (15%), all of which have been associated with a variety of cancers. Moreover, ATM, NOTCH2 and TRAF1 mutations were described before to be associated with lymphomas. In PPBL patients, mutations in TRAF1 and ATM as well as mutations in TRAF1 and NOTCH2 were found to be mutually exclusive. For CLL patients, 29 genes showed a mutation frequency of >15%, comprising ATM (26%), KMT2D (23%), NOTCH1 (23%), LRP1B (19%), TP53 (16%) and CREBBP (15%). Comparison of the mutation frequencies between the two entities revealed several genes with significant differences: whereas mutations in CKAP5 (11% vs. 2%, p=0.022) , DNMT3A (11% vs. 3%, p=0.033) , MAP2 (19% vs. 4%, p=0.009) , ROBO1 (15% vs. 4%, p=0.046) and TRAF1 (15% vs. 2%, p=0.006) were found to be more frequent in PPBL cases compared to CLL cases, KMT2D (4% vs. 23%, p=0.014) , TDRD6 (0% vs. 14%, p=0.032) and TP53 (4% vs. 16%, p=0.048) mutations were more abundantly detected in CLL patients. Moreover, NOTCH1 was mutated more frequently in CLL cases (7% vs. 23%, p=0.082), whereas mutated NOTCH2 (known to be frequently mutated in splenic marginal zone lymphoma), was more abundant in PPBL patients (15% vs. 6%, p=0.116), although both correlations were not statistically significant. Gene expression analyses by RNAseq revealed 337 genes to be differentially expressed between the entities. 207 genes were upregulated in PPBL, including PTPRK , CXCR1, BCL11B, CEPBA, CCR4 and MYC , whereas 130 genes were found to be upregulated in CLL cases, comprising ID3, BCL2, FGF2 and FLT1 . Conclusions: 1) WGS analysis identifies high frequencies of cancer/lymphoma-associated gene mutations in PPBL, including mutated ATM, NOTCH2 and TRAF1 . 2) Five genes showed a higher mutation frequency compared to CLL including TRAF1, DNMT3A , CKAP5 and MAP2. 3) Lymphoma associated genes ( BCL11B and MYC ) were overexpressed in PPBL vs CLL. 4) Taken together our results question PPBL as a benign entity and identify molecular markers that might contribute to development of subsequent malignancies.
