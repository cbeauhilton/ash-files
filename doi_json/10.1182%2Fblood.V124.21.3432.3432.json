    "abstract_text": "Numerous cellular effects have been attributed to IMiDs lenalidomide (LEN) and pomalidomide (POM) over the years. However, the zinc finger transcription factors Aiolos (IKZF3) and Ikaros (IKZF1) were identified only recently as substrates targeted for destruction in the presence of IMiDs compounds. LEN and POM bind directly to cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the cullin ring E3 ligase 4 (CRL4). Binding of these compounds to CRBN triggers the activation of CRL4 CRBN , ubiquitylation and destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros. We systematically compared growth, gene expression, and signal transduction responses elicited by doxycycline-inducible, stable Aiolos knockdown or POM treatment in MM cell lines, and their POM-resistant counterparts. Upon exposure to POM, U266 MM cells undergo rapid degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (90 min) and subsequent downregulation of IRF4 and Myc at 72 hr. At 72-96 hr, a decrease in proliferation and an increase in apoptosis are also observed. U266 MM cells selected in vitro for resistance to POM have lost CRBN expression and consequently no longer downregulate Aiolos and Ikaros after POM administration. Knockdown of Aiolos in these POM-resistant U266 MM cells is sufficient to inhibit their proliferative capacity by 50%, while Aiolos knockdown in POM-sensitive cells caused a greater inhibition of proliferation (90%). This suggests that MM cells with acquired resistance are still dependent on Aiolos for growth, but that a second mechanism may contribute to the antitumorigenic effect of Aiolos downregulation in POM-sensitive U266 cells. We have found that treatment with LEN or POM induces expression of antiviral response genes in MM cells. The induction of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as DDX58, IFIT1, IFIT3, XAF1, ISG15, IFI44, and IFI27 are seen by qPCR in 8 hr of compound treatment (1.8- to 5-fold increase in transcript level) and this effect is further enhanced at 24 and 72 hr. Of note, this response is not accompanied by an increase in \u03b2 IFN production. The IMiD compound-induced upregulation of the antiviral response correlates with CRL4-CRBN-mediated destruction of the lymphoid restricted transcription factor, Aiolos. In agreement with this, Aiolos knockdown by shRNA is sufficient to trigger a similar effect. These data suggest that Aiolos functions as a transcriptional repressor of ISGs, regulating the antiviral response. Consequently, Aiolos chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-Seq) experiments were performed, demonstrating that Aiolos binds near the transcription start site of numerous ISGs, including DDX58, IFIT1, ISG15, XAF1, IFI44, and IFI35. In addition, our data suggest that Aiolos co-binds with STAT and IRF family transcription factors and thereby co-regulates expression of these genes. STAT1 is part of the ISGF3 complex that drives ISG transcription upon viral infection. POM-resistant MM cells lacking CRBN expression do not have STAT1 activity and do not upregulate ISGs upon Aiolos knockdown, even though Myc and IRF4 are still being downregulated. In order to elucidate the relevance of the ISG expression in patients receiving IMiD treatment, we compared the gene expression profile of 12 patients after relapse or disease progression. Paired pre- and posttreatment samples from bone marrow-isolated CD-138 cells were evaluated with RNAseq and gene set enrichment analysis. We found an overall decrease in expression of ISGs, with significant negative enrichment of genes involved in IFN \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 signaling in relapsed patients. These data from clinical samples confirmed the importance and relevance of the ISGs in the response to IMiDs. In conclusion, our results indicate that Aiolos is a substrate of consequence in IMiD-sensitive MM cells, based on at least 2 pathways: driving the Myc-IRF4 feedback loop and repressing the antiviral pathway. Both in vitro and in vivo patient data suggest that one mechanism of IMiD resistance may be the abrogation of the STAT1 pathway resulting in subsequent blunting of the ISG induction. Finally, while upregulation of ISGs by IMiD treatment may serve as a relevant diagnostic marker of patient responsiveness to these drugs, these data highlight how response and resistance of the IMiD drugs are regulated by the interplay between complex pathway networks, suggesting that the measurement of only one component will not necessarily define the clinical course and outcomes for an individual patient.
