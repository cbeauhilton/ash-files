    "abstract_text": "On the basis of promising results obtained by imatinib mesilate in a patient with cerebral LCH with high expression of PDGFRb in the affected tissue (Case Report in press in the New Engl J Med), we evaluated PDGFRb expression by immunohistochemistry on banked LCH specimens. Methods: A 4 m m section obtained from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens was incubated in a microwave oven for 15 min in 10 mmol/L buffered citrate pH 6.0, followed by immunohistochemical procedures to detect PDGFRb (using a rabbit polyclonal antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., CA) and KIT (CD117, Dako, Carpinteria, CA), diluted 1:50 and 1:300, respectively. A conventional avidin-biotin complex procedure was then applied, according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, the sections were washed and incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C, then incubated with the secondary antibody. Positive staining was revealed by the DAB chromogen, followed by counterstaining with Mayer\u2019s hematoxilin. The slide was cover-slipped with a xilene-based mounting medium. The staining was scored as Neg, +1 (low expression), +2 (intermediate expression), or +3 (strong expression). Results. Up to now, we have analysed specimens from 9 patients (see Table). A strong PDGFRb expression with a predominant cytoplasmic localization was detected in 5 cases; two specimens had intermediate expression and two low expression. KIT expression was never observed. The study is ongoing, to evaluate a larger number of cases; however, in the limited series presented, 70% of cases had a significant PDGFRb expression. This finding may stimulate further clinical investigation on the use of tirosin kinase inhibitors in LCH. PDGFR\u00df and KIT expression in LCH specimens  Case . Gender/Age . Disease site . KIT .
