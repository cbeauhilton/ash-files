    "abstract_text": "Elevated levels of the acute phase plasma protein fibrinogen are associated with increased risk of thrombosis. Using a mouse model of arterial thrombosis, we have previously shown that elevated total fibrinogen levels increase the rate of fibrin formation, increase thrombus fibrin content, and directly promote arterial thrombosis (Machlus et al. 2011 Blood 117:4953-63). Fibrinogen is composed of two copies each of three polypeptide chains: A\u03b1, B\u03b2, and \u03b3. The fibrinogen \u03b3 chain undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in a dominant form (\u03b3A/\u03b3A) that comprises \u223c90% of circulating fibrinogen and a minor species (\u03b3A/\u03b3\u2019) that comprises 8-15% of circulating fibrinogen. Epidemiologic studies have detected elevated levels of \u03b3A/\u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen in patients with a history of arterial thrombosis, indicating that this isoform associates with thrombotic risk. However, in vitro data show that \u03b3A/\u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen has anticoagulant properties due to its ability to bind and sequester thrombin, and suggest that its expression is upregulated in response to a proinflammatory/procoagulant process. To determine whether \u03b3A/\u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen is pro- or antithrombotic in vivo, we purified \u03b3A/\u03b3A and \u03b3A/\u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen from human plasma by anion exchange chromatography, raised circulating levels in mice by intravenous infusion, and determined the effects of increased levels of these proteins on arterial thrombus formation in vivo. We also determined the effects of \u03b3A/\u03b3A and \u03b3A/\u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen on whole plasma clot formation, platelet aggregation, and endogenous procoagulant activity. Compared to buffer controls (7.3 [4.6-40.0] minutes, median [range]), \u03b3A/\u03b3A fibrinogen shortened the time to carotid artery occlusion (5.5 [4.0-8.0] minutes, P<0.05), whereas \u03b3A/\u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen did not (7.6 [4.9-40.0] minutes, P=0.9). Both \u03b3A/\u03b3A and \u03b3A/\u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen could be cleaved by murine and human thrombin, were incorporated into murine and human clots, and supported murine and human thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. When \u03b3A/\u03b3A or \u03b3A/\u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen was spiked into normal human or murine plasma, both \u03b3A/\u03b3A and \u03b3A/\u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen accelerated the fibrin formation rate (P<0.02). However, \u03b3A/\u03b3A fibrinogen increased the rate to a greater extent than \u03b3A/\u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen (P<0.02). Interestingly, compared to buffer controls (18.9 [9.8-126.2] ng/mL), mice infused with \u03b3A/\u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen had lower levels of circulating plasma thrombin-antithrombin complexes (6.2 [0.9-89.4] ng/mL, P<0.01) following arterial injury, whereas mice infused with \u03b3A/\u03b3A fibrinogen did not (13.2 [10.7-80.1] ng/mL, P=0.7). These data suggest \u03b3A/\u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen exhibits \u201cantithrombin I\u201d activity in vivo by binding thrombin and decreasing circulating prothrombotic activity. Together, these findings indicate that elevated levels of the \u03b3A/\u03b3A fibrinogen isoform promote arterial thrombosis in vivo, whereas the \u03b3A/\u03b3\u2019 isoform does not.
