    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4455 The clonally expanded T cells identified in most cancer patients which were considered to respond to tumour association antigen (TAA) have definitely specific anti-tumor cytotoxicity. P210 BCR-ABL protein regards as the hallmark of CML and known to be causative of the disease, and also expresses in partial acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) can induce to yield tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) which can kill bar-abl+ tumor cells in many trials. In our previous study, we found the oligoclonal expansion of TCR V\u03b221 subfamily in the peripheral blood (PB) of 8 cases with P210 BCR-ABL positive CML and 3 cases with P210 BCR-ABL positive B-ALL patients and 1 case with P210 BCR-ABL negative B-ALL patients using the genescan technology. To further elucidate the oligoclonal TCR V\u03b221 features, we carried out sequencing analysis of CDR3 region of each oligoclonal TCR V\u03b221 and determined the primary structure of the CDR3 region. The 12 TCR V\u03b221 clones used different J\u03b2 segments, J\u03b22.3 segment was used in 4 clones, both J\u03b22.1 and J\u03b21.1 segments were used in 2 clones respectively, J\u03b21.2, J\u03b21.3, J\u03b22.2 and J\u03b22.7 segments were used in 1 clone. Only a conserved amino acid motif (SLxxV) was found within the CDR3 region from 3 patients with CML. Then we constructed the three-dimensional structures of the CDR3 sequences from all 12 clones by homology modeling methods and through pairwise comparing with the three-dimensional structures of all CDR3 sequences, the results showed that the conformation of the CDR3 region either containing the conserved amino acid motif or using the same J\u03b2 segment displayed low similarity. Interesting, the conformation among some clones whose CDR3 region contain different amino acid motif and did not use the same J\u03b2 segment were high resemble. In conclusions, our findings described that the high frequency of TCR V\u03b221 subfamily expansion emerged in p210 BCR-ABL positive CML and B-ALL patients, and according to perplexing features of CDR3 region, it could not easy to confirmed that the oligoclonal expanded TCR V\u03b221 subfamily must recognize to p210 BCR-ABL protein, however, primary structure characterization of CDR3 region, in combination with spatial structure features, ultimately might help to identify the tumor-associated antigen immune attack on tumor cell in p210 BCR-ABL positive CML or B-ALL patients.
