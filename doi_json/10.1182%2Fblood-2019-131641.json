    "abstract_text": "The tetraspanin CD53 has been implicated in B cell development and function. Tetraspanins are a family of transmembrane proteins important for organization of the plasma membrane and regulation of cellular migration, adhesion, and activation. CD53 has been shown to be a transcriptional target of EBF1, a critical transcription factor for early B cell development. Additional signaling for early B cell development occurs through the IL-7 receptor (IL-7R), where ligation promotes continued B cell differentiation and pro-survival/anti-apoptotic gene expression. Human deficiency of CD53 results in recurrent infections and reduced serum immunoglobulins. While prior studies have implicated a role for CD53 in regulating mature B cells, its role in early B cell development is not well understood. Herein, we show that CD53 expression rapidly increases throughout B cell development, beginning at the pre-pro-B cell stage. With a CRISPR-generated knockout mouse, we show that Cd53 -/- mice have significantly reduced bone marrow (25% fewer, p<0.005), splenic (35% fewer, p<0.05), lymphatic (65% fewer, p<0.0001), and peripheral (30% fewer, p<0.005) B cells compared to wild-type (WT) littermate controls. Mirroring the human phenotype, Cd53 -/- mice have significantly reduced serum IgG and IgM (40% reduced, p<0.01). In addition, hematopoietic stem cells isolated from Cd53 -/- mice give rise to 30% fewer B cells compared to controls in vitro (p=0.005). Analysis of bone marrow B cell development demonstrates that this loss of B cells originates with early B cell progenitors, which express nearly 50% less IL-7Ra than WT and reduced IL-7 signaling. Using mass cytometry, we identified differential signaling pathways downstream of IL-7R in B cell progenitors. Specifically, we observe impaired PI3K and STAT5 activation in pre-pro- and pro-B cells in the absence of CD53, with a consequent increase in apoptosis in these populations (p<0.01). Decreased STAT5 phosphorylation was confirmed by western blot. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate a physical interaction between CD53 and IL-7Ra, suggesting that these proteins associate at the cell surface. Together, these data suggest a novel role for CD53 during IL-7 signaling to promote early B cell development. Ongoing studies are focused on determining the CD53 residues required for interaction with IL-7R. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
