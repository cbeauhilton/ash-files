    "abstract_text": "Abstract 172 The \u201cInnohep\u00ae in Renal Insufficiency Study\u201d (IRIS) was an international, multicentre, open, randomized, parallel group clinical trial with a primary objective to compare the safety of tinzaparin and unfractionated heparin in terms of clinically relevant bleeding (CRB) in elderly patients with impaired renal function for initial treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis. In the elderly, concerns have been raised about the risk of an accumulation effect and/or overdose due to the renal elimination of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH). In a subset of centres participating in the IRIS study, we conducted a substudy in order to assess whether there was an accumulation of anti-Xa activity and whether there was any relationship between anti-Xa activity and age, weight, creatinine clearance or clinical outcomes in patients treated with tinzaparin (175 IU/kg/24h) for venous thromboembolism. Plasma anti-Xa activity was to be analysed at peak level (4\u20136 hours after injection) on Day 2 or Day 3 and on Day 5 or at visit S (VS: day of visit at end of SC treatment) using a chromogenic assay (Rotachrom\u00ae heparin, Diagnostica Stago\u00ae). Of the complete IRIS study population who received tinzaparin (n=268), data from 87 patients (32%) were analysed. The patient characteristics (mean age 83\u00b15 years [75\u201399 years], mean creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault) 40.8 mL/min (SD 11.7, range 14\u201359) were consistent with those of the overall population of IRIS study. Of note, 24.1% had severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min). The mean peak anti-Xa activities, which were 0.86 (SD 0.34) and 0.87 (SD 0.31) IU/mL on Day2/3 and Day5/VS, respectively, were found close to the mean 0.85 IU/mL reported in the literature in patients receiving tinzaparin at therapeutic dose. There was no correlation between the anti-Xa activity and age, weight, or creatinine clearance. There was no significant difference in the anti-Xa levels between patients with, versus those without, severe renal impairment. The mean accumulation ratio (defined as anti-Xa activity on Day5/VS divided by the anti-Xa activity on Day2/3) was 1.06 (SD 0.30, 90% CI:1.01\u20131.11): as the 90% CI of the accumulation did not exceed the pre-defined upper limit of 1.25, no significant accumulation was detected. The mean anti-Xa activity did not differ significantly between the 8 patients experiencing a CRB during tinzaparin treatment and the 79 who did not experience a CRB during tinzaparin treatment. Among the 8 patients who had a CRB, one had an anti-Xa activity > 2.0 IU/mL (considered above therapeutic level) whereas the seven others had anti-Xa < 1.5 IU/mL. Interestingly, we found that the mean anti-Xa activities were significantly lower in the 12 patients with infectious disease at baseline compared to the patients without infectious disease: 0.66 (SD 0.18) vs 0.8 (SD 0.35) IU/mL on Day2/3, p=0.007; 0.62 (SD 0.23) vs 0.91 (SD 0.30) IU/mL on Day5/VS, p=0.002). These numbers are small but may require further investigation. There was no statistically significant difference in anti-Xa levels when comparing patients with versus those without ongoing malignancy. In conclusion, an IRIS substudy demonstrated no accumulation of anti-Xa activity in elderly patients with moderate to severe renal impairment receiving unadjusted recommended full dose of tinzaparin and confirms previous pharmacokinetic studies in similar populations. The high proportion of higher molecular weight moieties in tinzaparin may account for reduced dependence on renal elimination of the anti-Xa activity seen in elderly patients with renal impairment.
