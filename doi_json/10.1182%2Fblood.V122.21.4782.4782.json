    "abstract_text": "Background FXIII deficiency is one of the rare bleeding disorder (RBD) that has a highest incidence in Sistan and Baluchistan province around the world. This disorder represents with different clinical manifestations ranging from mild to severe bleeding tendency including CNS bleeding. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of PAI-14G/5Gpolymorphism in central nervous bleeding (intra and extracranial hemorrhage) system in factor XIII deficiency. Methods In this case control study was studied 32 FXIII deficient patients with CNS bleeding and also 32 patients with factor XIII deficiency without history of CNS bleeding as control group. Initially both groups were evaluated for the previously reported polymorphism of factor XIII (Trp187Argpolymorphism) in order to confirm their disorder. Then all patients were assessed for PAI-14G/5G polymorphism. Eventually obtained data was analyzed by SPSS software. Results The result of this study revealed that all study patients were homozygote for Trp187Arg polymorphism. We also found that the equal numbers of patients (4 individuals) in case and control groups were heterozygote for PAI-14G/5G polymorphism and none of patients were homozygote for this polymorphism. All heterozygote patients had intracranial hemorrhage and patients with extracranial hemorrhage had no mutation of PAI-14G/5G. Intraparenchymal was the most common site of hemorrhage and was observed in 26 patients (92.8%).We also observed subdural and epidural hemorrhage in two patients (7.1%).Anatomic regions in patients with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, were temporal in nine (32.2%), occipital in eight (28.6%), diffused intraparenchymal hemorrhage in seven (25%), tempro-occipital in two (7.1%) and subdural with temporal in two (7.1%) patients. Conclusion: It seems that PAI-14G/5G polymorphism did not any effect on occurrence of intra and extracranial hemorrhage in patients with factor XIII deficiency.
