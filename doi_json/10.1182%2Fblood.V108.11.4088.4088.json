    "abstract_text": "Objetives: to evaluate the prevalence of genetic polymorphism of coagulation factors: Leyden factor V (FVL), prothrombin mutation, deficiency of coagulation inhibitors, protein C, protein S and antithrombin (AT), test for the lupus anticoagulant/anticardiolipin and homocistein levels, during the laboratory investigation of patients with clinical suspicion of thrombosis. Patients and methods: This was done as a retrospective chart review study on 444 patients admitted at our hospital between November 2003 and December 2004 ( males 188, females 256). Medium age was 46 years. Prothrombin mutation and Factor V Leyden were searched by multiplex PCR, Protein C, S and lupus anticoagulant were studied by coagulometric methods, AT by chromogenic method, anticardiolipin by immunoenzymatic assay and homocistein by immunometric assay. Statistical analysis was performed using exact Fischer test or \u00d7 Pearson test. Results and conclusions: Prevalence of FVL was 32 cases, 7.2 %, 2 homozygotes and 30 heterozygotes. Prothrombyn mutation was found in 25 cases, 5.6 %, 1 homozygote and 24 heterozygotes. On 57 cases with genetic alteration 46 (80%) had thrombosis, 39 venous and 7 arterial. On 183 cases that done anticardiolipin test 27 cases were positive, 14.7 % (18 IgG, 6 IgM and 3 IgA). On those cases 22, 81.4 % had thrombosis, 15 venous and 7 arterial. All 3 cases with lupus anticoagulant had thrombosis. Hyperhomocistein was found in 7 cases, 3.2 %, with 4 cases associated with venous thrombosis and 1 with arterial thrombosis. Deficiencies of Protein C, Protein S and AT were found in 117 cases, l2.8 %, associated with 63 cases of thrombosis, 52 venous and 11 arterial, 56.3 %. Pathogenesis of thrombosis is complex and clearly associated with genetic and environmental factors - risk factors. On populations at risk for thrombosis laboratory investigation is essential."
