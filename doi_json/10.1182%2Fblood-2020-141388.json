    "abstract_text": "Introduction. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) are common adverse effects of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Elevated biomarkers, such as ferritin and LDH, have been shown to correlate with more severe toxicity. The endothelial activation and stress index (EASIX) is a surrogate of endothelial activation, and correlates to other biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction. In allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), it is predictive of toxicity such as fluid overload, which is correlative with endothelial dysfunction, as well as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, non relapse mortality and overall survival (Luft et al, BMT 2019, Varma et al, BBMT , 2020, Jiang et al, Haematologica , 2020). In this study we describe the correlation of EASIX to CAR T cell related CRS and ICANS. Methods. Retrospective data from consecutive patients treated with standard of care axi-cel for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at MD Anderson Cancer Center between January 2018 and April 2020 were included in the study. CRS and ICANS were graded according to CARTOX criteria (Neelapu et al, Nat Rev Clin Oncol , 2018), and after 5/2019, according to the ASTCT criteria (Lee et al, BBMT , 2019). EASIX parameters were recorded prior to lymphodepletion (the latest value on days -12 to -6) and were available for all 171 patients. The score was defined as lactate dehydrogenase (U/L) \u00d7 creatinine (mg/dL)/ thrombocytes (10^9 cells per L), with LDH adjusted to the upper limit of normal. Predictors of toxicity were evaluated using Fine and Grey regression analysis considering death before grade 2-4 toxicity as a competing risk. Results. 171 consecutive patients treated with commercial axi-cel for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (n=133), transformed follicular lymphoma (n=28) and primary mediastinal lymphoma (n=10) were included in the study. Median age was 59 years (range, 18-85), and 120 (70%) were male. 151 patients had an ECOG performance status \u22641, 45 patients (26%) had a previous autologous HCT, and 3 (1.8%) had a previous allogeneic HCT. Prior to lymphodepletion, 96 (56%) patients had a high IPI score (\u22653) and 134 (78%) were refractory to the previous line of treatment. With a median follow-up of 259 days (range: 25-800) since infusion, ICANS of any grade was noted in 109 (64%) patients, with 84 (49%) having grades 2-4. CRS of any grade was observed in 160 (93%) patients, with 81 (47%) having grades 2-4 CRS. A total of 56 (33%) patients were diagnosed with grade 2-4 ICANS and CRS. The median EASIX score for the entire cohort was 2.1 (range: 0.3-283; inter-quartiles: 1.1 and 4.6). On univariate analysis, EASIX levels above the median were associated with higher cumulative incidence (CI) of grade 2-4 ICANS (% CI: 61 vs 31%; HR=2.4, p<0.001); and levels above the upper quartile were associated with grade 2-4 CRS (% CI: 71 vs 38%; HR=2.2, p=0.02), (Figure 1,2). Additional predictors of grade 2-4 toxicity included IPI score \u22653 (HR=1.6, p=0.03) and female gender (HR=1.7, p=0.05) for ICANS; and IPI score \u2265 3 (HR=1.6, p=0.04) and lack of prior autologous transplant (HR=2, p=0.02) for CRS. Multivariate analysis showed EASIX score to be an independent predictor of grade 2-4 ICANS (HR=2.3, p=0.001) or CRS (HR=2.3, p=0.001); female gender of ICANS (HR=1.7, p=0.03) and lack of prior autologous transplant of CRS (HR=1.9, p=0.02). The impact of IPI did not reach statistical significance for either ICANS (HR=1.3, p=0.3) or CRS (HR=1.2, p=0.4). Further multivariate analysis for other biomarkers and their incorporation into a revised biomarker score will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions. Our results suggest that the EASIX score prior to lymphodepletion predicts higher grade CRS and ICANS in patients receiving axi-cel. These results of routinely available clinical variables require further prospective studies for validation, however our study shows that this score may better stratify patient risk of toxicity, and possibly inform clinical decisions and prevention strategies for patients at higher risk.
