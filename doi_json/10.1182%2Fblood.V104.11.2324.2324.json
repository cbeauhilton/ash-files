    "abstract_text": "The outcome of 63 consecutive submyeloablative allografts (27\u201366 y, median 52) performed for hematologic malignancies after 100 mg/m 2 melphalan without (n=21; prior autograft) or with (n=42; no prior autograft) 50 mg/kg cyclophosphamide was analyzed to study the effect of pre-transplant characteristics. GVHD prophylaxis comprised cyclosporine-mycophenolate (n=37; HLA-identical sibling donors) or tacrolimus-mycophenolate (n=26, 1-locus mismatched sibling or 9\u201310/10 allele-matched unrelated). No growth factors were administered routinely post-transplant and supportive care was uniform. 14 patients experienced transplant-related mortality (TRM), and 32 relapsed. 24 relapsing patients died, and 7 of the other 8 are alive in CR or with declining disease. The following factors were analyzed in a Cox model for their effect on TRM and relapse: chemosensitive (n=25) vs refractory disease (n=38), age \u226455 (n=44) vs >55 (n=19), normal (n=32) vs abnormal (n=31) LDH, HLA match (n=56) vs mismatch (n=7), prior autograft or not, performance status 0\u20131 (n=47) vs 2\u20133 (n=16).

Based on the causes of failure, the following modifications appear to be warranted. Group A: A completely non-ablative regimen to reduce toxicity. Group B: A completely non-ablative regimen to reduce toxicity with augmentation of graft-vs-tumor effects by elective donor leukocyte infusions and/or abbreviated immunosuppression. Group C: Augmentation of graft-vs-tumor effects by elective donor leukocyte infusions and/or abbreviated immunosuppression. Group D: Conventional-intensity rather than reduced-intensity allogeneic HSCT.",
