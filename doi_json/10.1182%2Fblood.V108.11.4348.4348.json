    "abstract_text": "Two isoforms of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 are expressed in all cells\u2014alpha] (p92) and \u03b2 (p83)\u2014both derived from a single gene by alternative mRNA splicing. Structurally, Stat3\u03b1 contains a 55-residue C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD), which is deleted in Stat3\u03b2 and replaced by 7 unique C-terminal residues (CT7) whose function remains uncertain. Functionally, Stat3\u03b1 is transcriptionally active while Stat3\u03b2 is not despite binding DNA more tightly than Stat3\u03b1. Stat3\u03b1 is an oncogene activated in many cancers including multiple myeloma, acute myelogenous leukemia and lymphoma, while Stat3\u03b2 appears to antagonize the oncogenic functions of Stat3\u03b1. To gain additional insight into the distinct biological and oncogenic functions of Stat3\u03b1 and \u03b2 at the single-cell level and, in particular, to determine the function of the unique CT7 domain of Stat3\u03b2, we subcloned the open reading frames of Stat3\u03b1, Stat3\u03b2 and Stat3\u03b2 missing the CT7 domain (\u0394Stat3\u03b2) into the C-terminus of GFP. Immunoblot analysis and DNA binding studies demonstrated that each GFP-tagged construct encoded proteins of the expected size that bound DNA. Similar to their non-tagged counterparts, GFP-Stat3\u03b1, but neither GFP-Stat3\u03b2 nor GFP-\u0394Stat3\u03b2, activated a reporter construct containing acute phase response elements. Each GFP-Stat3 construct was stably expressed in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) in which Stat3 was deleted previously using Cre/lox technology. Following selection, clones were isolated and sorted to ensure levels of expression of each GFP-Stat3 construct similar to levels found in wild type MEF cells. Fluorescence microscopic analysis of unstimulated MEF/\u03b1, MEF/\u03b2 and MEF/\u0394\u03b2 cells revealed predominantly diffuse cytoplasmic localization of each GFP-tagged protein. Stimulation of cells with IL-6 (200 ng/ml) and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R, 250 ng/ml) revealed similar kinetics of cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation for each GFP-Stat3 construct with translocation starting at 10 min and becoming maximal at 30 min. High throughput microscopy analysis of 1,000 or more cells following removal of IL-6/sIL-6R revealed a nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation half life of 15 min for GFP-Stat3\u03b1 and >3hr for GFP-Stat3\u03b2. In contrast to GFP-Stat3\u03b2, GFP-\u0394Stat3\u03b2 had a nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation half life of <30 min similar to GFP-Stat3\u03b1 indicating that the CT7 domain was responsible for prolonged nuclear retention of GFP-Stat3\u03b2. The intranuclear mobility of the GFP-Stat3 constructs was determined by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). The mobility of GFP-Stat3\u03b1 assessed by fluorescence recovery half-time (t 1/2 ) increased 33% with IL-6/sIL-6R stimulation (t 1/2 =1.07 \u00b1 0.58 s before stimulation; t 1/2 =0.72 \u00b1 0.45 s after stimulation; p<0.05). The mobility of GFP-Stat3\u03b2 in unstimulated cells (1.89 \u00b1 0.51 s) was 77% slower than GFP-Stat3\u03b1 without stimulation (p<0.05) and was slowed 52% further following IL-6/sIL-6R simulation (2.88 \u00b1 0.60 s; p<0.05). While deletion of the unique CT7 domain from Stat3\u03b2 eliminated prolonged nuclear retention, it did not substantially reduce its intranuclear mobility (1.48 \u00b1 0.47 s without stimulation; 2.63 \u00b1 0.65 s following stimulation). Thus, Stat3\u03b1 and Stat3\u03b2 have distinct intracellular dynamics with Stat3\u03b2 exhibiting prolonged nuclear retention and reduced intranuclear mobility both without and with stimulation; prolonged nuclear retention, but not reduced intranuclear mobility, map to the CT7 domain of Stat3\u03b2.",
