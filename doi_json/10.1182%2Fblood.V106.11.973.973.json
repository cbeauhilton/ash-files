    "abstract_text": "Little is known about the cytokine profile of nodular lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) and the significance of the characteristic rosetting CD4 + /CD57 + T-cells. We analyzed the T-lymphocyte populations isolated from lymph node suspensions of 5 patients with NLPHL, 2 with follicular hyperplasia and progressive transformation of germinal centres (PTGC), 3 with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) and 5 with hyperplasia of the tonsil. We sorted the T-cells based on expression of CD3, CD4 and CD57 by flow cytometry and evaluated the cytokine mRNA profiles of the T-cells with quantitative RT-PCR. NLPHL cases were as rich in T-cells as the CHL cases, but all NLPHL cases with a much higher frequency of CD4 + /CD57 + T-cells. In contrast to the CD4 + /CD57 + T-cells from tonsils, IL2 and IL4 mRNA was consistently absent from the CD4 + /CD57 + T-cells of NLPHL. Even after stimulation, no IL4 transcripts could be detected in the CD4 + /CD57 + T-cells of NLPHL. On the other hand, IFN \u03b3 transcripts were elevated in NLPHL and PTGC T-cell subsets as compared to tonsillar T-cell subsets. IL13 mRNA was exclusively produced by the T-cells of CHL cases, indicating that IL13 may be a key cytokine in CHL. In conclusion, elevated levels of CD4 + /CD57 + T-cells are characteristic for NLPHL and these T-cells display a distinct cytokine mRNA profile.",
