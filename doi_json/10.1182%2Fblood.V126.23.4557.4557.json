    "abstract_text": "Introduction Iron (Fe) overload is directly related to the morbidity & ultimate survival. NTDT is different. Overloading occurs from ineffective erythropoiesis, dietary absorption & rescue transfusions (Taher-Cappellini, 2009, p 634-40), the result - organ dysfunction related morbidity and mortality. Other than Serum ferritin (SFr) (Origa-Galanello, 2007, p583-8) MRI has been used for organ specific Fe content estimation (Taher-Musallam, 2010, p 288-90). We will try to establish Fe overload exists in subjects of HbE \u03b2 NTDT & assess the best method for Fe overload in patients & it's relation to increasing age. This is the 1st attempt to study Fe overload in HbE \u03b2 NTDT patients of India. Study proper Diagnosed by HPLC and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, 105 NTDT HbE \u03b2 thalassaemia patients of either sex, -ve for hepatitis B, C & HIV, with age ranging of 4 - 55 years, receiving <1 unit to a maximum of 15 transfusions till date, were included. SFr was tested by CLIA and LIC by MRI from Resonance Health, Ferriscan (St Pierre-Clark, 2005, p 855-61). Age, SFr, LIC and complications were collected & their interrelationship analyzed statistically. Results & Discussion Out of the 105 subjects, 51(48.5%) were males, mean age \u00b1 SD was 19\u00b19.5 yrs. (range 4 - 54); 41.8% were splenectomized; 31% were transfusion naive & none had received prior chelation. Mean SFr was 1211.9 \u00b1 2048 ng/ml, mean LIC was 11.76 \u00b1 12.41 mg / g DLT. The correlation between age & LIC - 0.159; age & SFr - 0.173 and LIC & SFr - 0.62. Study shows despite the NTDT status, HbE \u03b2 thalassaemia patients develop Fe overload as evidenced by SFr level > 200-450 ng/ml & LIC by MRI s >3 mg/g of DLT in 63.8%. In this study, mean LIC was 11.76 \u00b112.41 mg/g DLT, significantly lower than base line of 13.8\u00b1 7.6 mg/g DLT, in THALSA (Taher-Porter, 2014, p 521-26) and 14.5\u00b18.8 mg/g DLT (Taher-Porter, 2012, p 970-7). In 61% LIC was >5 mg/g DLT, but SFr  800 ng/ml. So SFr, may lie on both sides of LIC, and is not to be interpreted in isolation. SFr levels may underestimate Fe load in NTDT (Taher-Hershko, 2009, p 634-40), this study shows that it may be higher. In thalassaemia intermedia (TI) patients, advancing age is associated with > SFr and serious morbidities (Taher-Musallam, 2010, p 486-9), but not universally, this study showed that, 83% recorded increased LIC with increaseing age in subjects >15 yrs., 79% age >10 yrs. yearly increase in LIC, & total body Fe was 0.144 mg/g DLT/yr. or 0.57 - 2.49 mg/kg/yr. lower than 1.0 - 3.5 g/yr. by other authors (Taher-Vipraksit, 2013, p 409-15),could be due to Fe deficient diet & black tea consumption. As reported others, +ve correlation between SFr & LIC was observed in NTDT (Taher-Porter, 2012 p 970-77; Taher-Rassi, 2008, p 1584 - 86), high +ve correlation between SFr & LIC (0.81), when SFr level was < 300 ng/ml & LIC of 30 yrs. group, +ve correlation of 0.849, but no linear correlation was obtained. In 8 diabetic patients , all had LIC > 6 mg/g DLT but 37.5% had SFr >2500 ng/ml, value of SFr above which complication occurs, so LIC is better predictor of complications. This was comparable to the study among 168 patients of \u03b2 TI, LIC was \u2265 6mg/g DLT, suffered from endocrine/bone disease & 1mg increase in LIC was independently associated with significantly increased risk of vascular, endocrine & osteogenic morbidities (Musallam-Cappellini, 2011, p 1605-12), this is true for patients with LIC > 6mg/g DLT, as in our study. Conclusion This study concludes that even in the absence of transfusion, Fe overload occurs in NTDT. SFr, an invasive procedure, is a bad predictor of Fe overload, especially in NTDT, it may under / over estimate Fe overload. LIC estimation by MRI is a better predictor of total body Fe than SFr. It bears correlation if SFr is below 300 ng/ml & that of liver Fe is <3mg/g DLT. Iron overload increases with age but the rate can be controlled with Fe deficient diet & regular tea intake. Complications also occur in NTDT from Fe overload & is better predictable by LIC estimation than by SFr levels. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
