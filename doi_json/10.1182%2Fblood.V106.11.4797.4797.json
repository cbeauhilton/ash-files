    "abstract_text": "Adult T -cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL) is an aggressive disease associated with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I) with heterogeneous clinical presentation and outcomes, described in Southern Japan, Europe, Caribbean and previously on Pacific coast of South America including Peru (EHA 2001, abst. 304). Shimoyama\u2019s ATL classification ( BHJ  1991 : 79 ) includes four types: acute, lymphomatous, chronic and smoldering; recently a new clinical type cutaneous had been described ( BJD  2005 : 152 ). Herein we show our experience in ATL in our institution between October 1997 and May 2005 All our 55 cases shown positivity to HTLV-I Western Blot test; immune-histopathology, blood smears and flow cytometry showed mature T-cell lymphocyte. Median age at diagnosis 61 years old (range 23\u201384), female/male ratio: 1.2. Thirty-one (56%) patients had ECOG status performance at diagnosis \u2265 2. Clinical types: acute (n=26), lymphomatous (n=22), smouldering (n=2), cutaneous (n=5) with no chronic type observed. Median haemoglobin diagnosis was 12.1 g/dl (range 6.9\u201317), median albumin was 3.2 g/dl (range 1.8 \u2013 4.9), median beta-2 microglobulin was 4.6 g/dl (range 1.5 \u2013 16.9), median globulin was 2.7 g/dl (range 1.5 \u2013 8.2) and DHL was 796 UI/ml (range 331 \u2013 13000). Twenty-five per cent (9/36) debuted with hypercalemia (acute type=7, lymphomatous=2). Acute ATL showed median leukocytes of 48,900 cell/mm 3 (range 6830\u2013259,000). IPI risk score was: low (n=6), low intermediate (n=7), high intermediate (n=16) and high (n=27). Treatment for acute ATL was based on acute leukaemia and lymphoma regimens without any response but one, interestingly this patient was treated with Fludarabine 25 mg/mt2 day 1\u20135 each 28 day for 6 cycles and got complete remission. Twenty-one over 24 lymphomatous ATL type were evaluable for treatment response: overall response 38% (9/24) with 26% complete response. Smouldering and cutaneous ATL types received mainly topic treatments. Stratify analysis for IPI, DHL, beta-2 microglobulin, globulin and albumin for acute and non-acute ATL did not show any statistic difference. Median overall survival was: acute type (2.0 months DE 0.2), lymphomatous type (10.2 months DE 3.6), smouldering type (17.2 months) and cutaneous type (36.2 months DE 19.5) (Log Rank 30,76 p=0.0) ATL persist is a poor prognostic peripheral T-lymphocytic malignancy with bad clinical and therapeutically outcomes mainly in the acute type. Cutaneous type seems to be less aggressive. View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure  Close modal",
