    "abstract_text": "Background . In Classic Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL), malignant cells constitute only about 1% of the bulk of tumor tissue, the rest constitutes the microenvironment and is made up of a compound of inflammatory cells. Lymphocytopenia and increased CD68+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are adverse prognostic factors in cHL. TAMs are derived from circulating monocytes and are possibly related to absolute monocyte count (AMC). We have sought to investigate the relationship of circulating lymphocytes and monocytes with response and survival in patients. Recently, Porrata et al. reported that a low absolute lymphocyte count/absolute monocyte count at diagnosis [ALC/AMC-Dx] (<1.1) is an independent prognostic factor in cHL. Subsequent studies used different cutoffs for ALC/AMC (1.5 and 2.9). Currently, there are no studies that evaluate the usefulness of the index relative to the overall response. Aim To determine the prognostic value of ALC /AMC at diagnosis in patients with cHL and its impact on treatment response to therapy, progression and overall survival. Methods: We evaluated 262 consecutive individuals with cHL, referred and treated at the National Cancer Institute in Mexico between 2006 to 2013. The great majority of patients were treated with ABVD with or without radiotherapy, and all had available data for ALC/AMC determined at diagnosis. It was made a multivariate analysis and ROC curves for cutoff point of ALC/AMC. Results : Median age was 35 y (14-89), 59.2% of patients were male, 77% had B-symptoms, 36.3% had stage IV disease, 85% had advanced stage (IB,IIB,III,IV), 51.5% had IPS \u22653, 46.2% nodular sclerosing histology and 45.4% mixed cellularity. The overall response (CR + PR) was obtained in 188 patients (72%) and failure (stable disease or progressive disease) in 73 patients (28%). A new cutoff point, 1.77 in ALC/AMC-Dx ratio with area under the curve of 0.62. Multivariate analysis showed that the ALC/AMC-Dx index was an independent predictor for response to treatment, progression as well as overall survival (Table 1). Additionally the IPS\u22653 showed to be an independent factor for response 68.8% vs 41.7% in low and high risk, respectively (p<0.0000). Conclusion: In our population ALC/AMC-Dx index was established with a cutoff of 1.77. The group of patient with < 1.77 had a less overall response and overall survival. It proves that ALM/AMC-Dx is an independent predictor of response, progression and overall survival in patients with classical cHL. That differs of other reviews where the cutoff was lower. Table 1.
