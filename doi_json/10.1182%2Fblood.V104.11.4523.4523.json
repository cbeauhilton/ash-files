    "abstract_text": "Temsirolimus (CCI-779, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) has been shown to inhibit proliferation of a variety of tumors and induce G1 cell cycle arrest by preventing activation of the serine/threonine kinase, mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a downstream effector of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Several lines of evidence implicate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in hematological malignancies. Interim results of a phase II study evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of single-agent temsirolimus in patients with advanced malignancies are presented. Temsirolimus was administered weekly, at a flat dose of 25 mg, as a 30-minute intravenous infusion. Treatment was continued until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. To date, 8 patients have been enrolled and 7 are evaluable for efficacy and toxicity (one patient did not receive temsirolimus). Of these 7 patients, 5 had AML, 1 CML-myeloid blast crisis, and 1 ALL. Median age was 68 years (range, 21 to 87 years) and 5 were male. All patients had received prior therapy, median 2 regimens (range, 1 to 3 regimens). The median number of temsirolimus doses administered was 3 (range, 1 to 10) with a median time on study of 18 days (range, 3 to 89+ days). The most common temsirolimus-related adverse events were grade \u2264 2 and consisted of anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting and diarrhea, mucositis, dermatitis, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and fatigue/asthenia. No patient developed nonspecific pneumonitis. Grade 3 toxicities included fatigue/asthenia (2), hyperglycemia (1), painful mucositis with dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities (1), diarrhea with hypokalemia (1), and hypophosphatemia (1). No patient experienced grade 4 toxicities or death from temsirolimus. No patient required dose reductions, but 2 did have dose delays due to grade 3 mucositis (1) and out-of-state hospitalization for pneumonia and atrial fibrillation (1). No patient achieved a complete remission. One patient with heavily pre-treated Philadelphia-negative precursor B-cell ALL had a transient 79% to 91% reduction in peripheral blood blasts 4 days after the first dose of temsirolimus that was maintained for 12 days prior to disease progression with involvement of the synovial fluid in bilateral knees. At the time of analysis, 6 of the 7 patients have discontinued treatment due to disease progression (4), patient refusal (1), or physician decision (1). Preliminary findings indicate that temsirolimus is relatively well-tolerated at a dose of 25 mg per week and may have biologic activity in ALL. Accrual onto the study is currently ongoing."
