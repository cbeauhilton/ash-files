    "abstract_text": "Outcome for children with relapsed/refractory leukemia is unsatisfactory. Dasatinib is a novel oral kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL, KIT, and SRC family kinases. Recently, approval was granted for adult CML and Ph+ ALL with resistance to prior therapy. CA180018, the 1st trial evaluating dasatinib in children (age 1\u201320 yrs) and conducted in 12 centres from the ITCC Consortium, is a phase I/II dose-finding study in patients (pts) with either imatinib resistant/intolerant CML, relapsed/refractory Ph+ or Ph\u2212 ALL, or AML in 2nd or greater relapse. The starting dose was 60 mg/m 2 QD; intra-pt dose escalation for lack of initial response and dose-(de)escalations were safety and efficacy guided and aimed at establishing a safe and effective dose for each leukemia sub-type. These data reflect the first 34 pts (median age 12.6 y, range 1.6\u201320) treated from Mar 06 to Aug 07: 6 chronic phase [CP] CML, 2 advanced phase [AP] CML, 8 Ph+ ALL, 6 Ph\u2212 ALL, and 12 Ph\u2212 AML. Prior therapy included chemotherapy, imatinib, and stem cell transplant. Intra-pt dose escalation to 80 or 100 mg/m 2 occurred in 21 pts. 7 pts remain on study. Safety: 51 SAEs in 22 patients were noted, and included febrile neutropenia/infections (n=27), GI toxicity (n=8), rash (n=4), and grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia (n=3). One dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed: a grade 4 anaphylactic reaction 5 h after the first dose in a pt with a history of hypensensitivity reactions. One pt had a pleural effusion that also contained leukemic cells. Responses: 5/6 CP CML pts are evaluable for response: 3 pts went into complete hematologic remission; 2 had a complete and 1 had a partial cytogenetic response (CygR). One pt was enrolled with molecular disease only, and PCR values became undetectable after 3 months. One pt never achieved a hematological or CygR, yet no resistance mutations were detected. The pt with myeloid AP CML had a major CygR for \u223c3 months; the pt with lymphoid BP CML had a complete CygR (14% BCR-ABL+ cells using FISH), but experienced clonal evolution with \u223c28% blasts in the marrow at the same time. Of the 8 pts with Ph+ ALL, 3 showed complete morphologic and cytogenetic remission, lasting for 6 weeks, 1 month, and >2 months for one pt still on study. One other pt with isolated CSF relapse cleared the CSF for \u223c7 months with dasatinib only, has subsequently received additional intrathecal chemotherapy, and remains on study 17 months later. Four pts did not respond, 2 of who harbored the T315I mutation. Of the 6 Ph\u2212 ALL pts, 4 were evaluable, and none achieved a CR. In 1/4 pts there was a significant drop in WBC for approximately 2 months. Among the 12 Ph\u2212 AML pts, one had a drop in BM blasts from 60 to 2% (without full PB regeneration), and one pt from 60 to 15% blasts. None of the AMLs appeared to be KIT-mutated. These data show that dasatinib was well tolerated up to 100 mg/m 2 ; the encouraging early signs of response in Ph+ disease support its further exploration in relapsed/refractory pediatric leukemia pts. Higher dose levels are currently being explored and updated clinical and PK data will be presented."
