    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3752 The \u03b2-hemoglobinopathies sickle cell disease and \u03b2-thalassemia are among the most common human genetic disorders worldwide. Hemoglobin A2 (HbA2, \u03b1 2 \u03b4 2 ) and fetal hemoglobin (HbF, a 2 \u03b3 2 ) both inhibit the polymerization of hemoglobin S that results in erythrocyte sickling. Expression of erythroid Kruppel-like factor (EKLF) and GATA1 is critical for transitioning hemoglobin from HbF to hemoglobin A (HbA, \u03b1 2 \u03b2 2 ) and HbA2. The lower levels of \u03b4-globin expression compared with \u03b2-globin expression seen in adulthood are likely due to the absence of an EKLF-binding motif in the \u03b4-globin proximal promoter. In an effort to upregulate \u03b4-globin to increase HbA2 expression, we created a series of EKLF-GATAl fusion constructs composed of the transactivation domain of EKLF and the DNA-binding domain of GATAl and then tested their effects on hemoglobin expression. EKLF-GATAl fusion proteins activated \u03b4-, \u03b3-, and \u03b2-globin promoters in K562 cells, and significantly upregulated \u03b4- and \u03b3-globin RNA transcripts and proteins expression in K562 and CD34 + cells. The binding of EKLF-GATA1 fusion proteins at the GATA1 consensus site in the \u03b4-globin promoter was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Our studies demonstrate that EKLF-GATA1 fusion proteins can enhance \u03b4-globin expression through interaction with the \u03b4-globin promoter, and may represent a potentially new genetic therapeutic approach to \u03b2-hemoglobinopathies.
