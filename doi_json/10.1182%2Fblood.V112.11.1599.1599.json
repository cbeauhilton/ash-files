    "abstract_text": "Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) plays an essential role in tumor angiogenesis and growth by regulating the transcription of several genes in response to hypoxic stress and changes in growth factors. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric transcriptional activator and consists of inducible \u03b1 and constitutive \u03b2 subunits. In oxygenated cells, intracellular oxygen concentrations are directly sensed by proteins containing the prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD), which tag HIF-1\u03b1 subunits for polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by prolyl hydroxylation using 2-oxoglutarate (2-OX) and dioxygen. Our recent studies have shown that 2-OX reduces HIF-1\u03b1, erythropoietin, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression by hypoxia in the hepatoma cell line Hep3B (Matsumoto K et al.; J. Cell. Physiol., 2006). Similar results were obtained in Lewis lung cancer (LLC) cells in in vitro studies. Here, to address the clinical usefulness of 2-OX, we investigated its antitumor effect using a mouse dorsal air sac (DAS) assay and a murine tumor xenograft model. For the DAS assay, LLC cells suspended in PBS with 0, 7.5, or 15 mM 2-OX per Millipore chamber were implanted subcutaneously into C57BL/6J mice. The values of blood vessel area by LLC cells were 100 \u00b1 20.8, 64.0 \u00b1 9.4, and 45.6 \u00b1 4.4%, respectively, by quantitative analysis with angiogenesis-measuring software. This result indicated that 2-OX clearly inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumors. To elucidate the effect of 2-OX on tumor growth, 2-OX was administrated to C57BL/6J mice inoculated with LLC cells. LLC cells (1 \u00d7 10 6 ) in PBS were implanted into the right flank region of 7-week-old mice. Daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 2-OX were started on the next day after implantation. From 6 to 12 days after implantation, we measured tumors with calipers and calculated volumes as (length \u00d7 width 2 ) \u00d7 0.5. LLC tumors were removed from mice 12 days after implantation for quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical studies. Tumor volumes and weights 12 days after implantation were as follows: PBS alone, 330.8 \u00b1 108.1 mm 3 and 192.6 \u00b1 66.4 mg; 50 mg/kg 2-OX, 128.8 \u00b1 16.4 mm 3 and 111.0 \u00b1 64.5 mg; and 100 mg/kg 2-OX, 78.7 \u00b1 43.7 mm 3 and 88.8 \u00b1 57.5 mg. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that 2-OX treatment (100 mg/kg) decreased the expression levels of the VEGF gene 0.67-fold in tumor tissues compared with control. We observed quantitative differences in microvessel density (PBS alone, 100 \u00b1 16.5%; 100 mg/kg 2-OX, 46.0 \u00b1 13.5%) using immunostaining for the endothelial cell marker CD31. Intraperitoneal injection of 2-OX significantly inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis in tumor tissues. Combination therapy is necessary for anti-angiogenic therapy in the human. To examine the effect of 2-OX in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy, we injected 5-FU i.p. on day 6 and/or 2-OX i.p. on each of days 6\u201315 in this mouse model. Tumor volumes and weights 15 days after implantation were as follows: PBS alone, 531.2 \u00b1 144.9 mm 3 and 306.3 \u00b1 186.6 mg; 2-OX alone, 324.0 \u00b1 156.5 mm 3 and 308.7 \u00b1 299.0 mg; 5-FU alone, 287.1 \u00b1 155.2 mm 3 and 204.7 \u00b1 108.9 mg; and 5-FU + 2-OX, 98.7 \u00b1 64.9 mm 3 and 130.3 \u00b1 113.5 mg. 5-FU combined with 2-OX significantly inhibited tumor growth in this model, which was accompanied by 53% reduction of VEGF gene expression in tumor tissues removed from mice 15 days after implantation, using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. These results suggest that 2-OX is a promising anti-angiogenic therapeutic agent. To examine whether the inhibitory effect of 2-OX is specific for PHD-containing proteins, an RNAi study will be performed."
