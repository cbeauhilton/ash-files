    "abstract_text": "Background: Rituximab (Rtx) with Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisone (R-CHOP) regimen could improve the survivalship in treatment of B cell lymphoma, however, also increases the possibilities of infectious disease including pulmonary pneumonia. Methods and materials : A prospective study was conducted in Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center from Feb 2008 to Oct 2015 to analyze the addition of thyomosin (Th \u03b11) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) supportive therapy impact in preventive role of pulmonary adverse effect (PAE) incidence rate related to Rtx based immuno-chemotherapy. Results : Out of 379 cases, 215 in Th \u03b11 and IVIG (study) group and 164 in non Th \u03b11 and IVIG (control) group compared; 80 (21.1%) of them developed PAE: 39 Rtx immuno-chemotherapy induced interstitial pulmonary disease (IPD) and 41 infectious pneumonia (IP) cases were developed after the 4rth median cycles (2.8 months) of R-CHOP regimen from the first exposure until prior to induced PAE and 11 cases of IP were isolated with etiology. In comparing the role of Th \u03b11 and IVIG vs. control group; out of 41 R-CHOP induced pneumonia cases: 9 (2.4%) vs. 32 (8.4%) with p <0.001, respectively found. In multivariate analysis, Th \u03b11 and IVIG ( p <0.001) was the independent highly significant factors related to decrease infectious pneumonia prevalence rate. Furthermore chemotherapy disruption rate due to pneumonia was 4.2% vs. 38.5%, in study and control group ( p = 0.005), respectively. Incidence of pneumonia was found significantly lower in study group than control group in account of high risk advanced stages (Fisher's Exact Test, p <0.001) and age\u226560 (Fisher's Exact Test, p = 0.002) group. 6 years of event free survival (EFS) was found higher in study group 73.2% in compare to control group 52.6% with p <0.001. Conclusions : The B cell lymphoma patients with high risk factors along with the risk of developing infectious pneumonia may be substantially decreased by the regular implication of Th \u03b11 and IVIG along the Rtx based chemotherapy that may result effective in improving EFS too.
