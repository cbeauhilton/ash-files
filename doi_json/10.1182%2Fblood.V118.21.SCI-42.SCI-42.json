    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-42 The identification of safe and effective methods to expand human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) would have a major impact on the use of HSC in clinical medicine. Several features of human HSC, including the lack of a suitable cell line model and cumbersome methods for quantification, have made the identification of conditions for human HSC expansion challenging. Current culture methods using cytokine cocktails in serum-free media support the robust proliferation of CD34 positive (CD34+) cells but this is accompanied by rapid differentiation such that after 1 week of culture fewer than 20% of cells continue to express CD34. To overcome these limitations we developed a high throughput screen that uses primary human CD34+ cells and multiparameter flow cytometry to identify compounds capable of expanding human CD34 positive cells. By screening >100,000 LMW compounds we identified a molecule (SR1) that enhanced CD34 expression during ex vivo culture. Culture of CD34+ cells with cytokines and SR1 for 3 weeks leads to a >600-fold increase in the number of CD34+ cells, and a >2000-fold increase in the number of CFU compared to starting cell numbers. Importantly, cells expanded in the presence of SR1contain a 17-fold increase in the number of NOD-SCID repopulating cells compared to starting cell numbers. Mechanistic studies reveal that SR1 binds to and antagonizes the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Knockdown of the AHR in CD34+ cells using lentiviral transduction also maintains CD34 expression. These findings suggest that AHR normally promotes HSC differentiation during ex vivo culture and that AHR antagonists can be used to promote CD34 cell expansion. To determine the clinical utility of these findings, we have begun to explore the use of SR1 to expand CD34+ cells isolated from umbilical cord blood for clinical transplantation. To this end, we have developed a GMP compatible process to manufacture CD34 positive cells expanded with SR1 for use in cord blood transplantation. In addition, we have also explored the use of SR1 to prevent HSC differentiation during HSC transduction and enable manufacturing of differentiated blood cells. These data reveal AHR antagonism and SR1 treatment as a promising method to promote HSC expansion for clinical use. Disclosures: Cooke: Novartis: Employment. Boitano: Novartis: Employment."
