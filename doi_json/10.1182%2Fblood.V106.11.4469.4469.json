    "abstract_text": "The herbal drug khat (Catha edulis Forsk.) is habitually used in Eastern Africa and the Middle East. The pharmacological activity of khat is due to its alkaloid fraction which initiates a rapid release of monoamine neurotransmitters from nerve terminals when ingested. Extracts from khat have been shown to induce cell death caspase-dependent apoptosis in human leukaemia cells. In this study, apoptotic sensitivity is correlated with endogenous protein expression of the anti-apoptogen Bcl-2, as well as transfection enforced over expression of Bcl-2. Exposure of a panel of human leukaemia cell lines to khat extract resulted in the development of similar apoptotic morphotypes. The sensitivity of the cell lines to khat induced apoptosis revealed a trend of inverse correlation with endogenous levels of Bcl-2. Stable or transient transfection of Bcl-2 inhibited khat-induced apoptosis, and the threshold for khat-induced apoptosis was lowered by blocking Bcl-2 synthesis with small interfering RNA. Together, these data suggest Bcl-2 modulation as a possible mechanistic pathway through which khat-induced apoptosis may occur."
