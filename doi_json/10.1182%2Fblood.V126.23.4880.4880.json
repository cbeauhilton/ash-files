    "abstract_text": "Objective: To investigate the haemostatic/oxidative changes and its association in patients of acute leukemia at the time of diagnosis. Study Design : Cross sectional and descriptive. Setting : Study was carried out in National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation during 2011 to 2013. Material and Methods: Activity of Superoxide dismutase(SOD), Glutathione Reductase(GR), Total antioxidant status(TAS), Prothrombin Time, Activated Partial Thromboplastine Time, Fibrinogen, Factor VIII and Tissue Factor were evaluated in the hemolysate, sera, citrated plasma and leukemic cells of 150 patients with acute leukemia at the time of diagnosis in 40 healthy individuals. Results: The mean age of patients was 29.8 years.Activity of SOD, GR and TAS were significantly higher in patients of acute leukemia as compared to control (<0.01). Significant haemostatic changes were identified in patients of acute leukemia. Strong association was found between oxidative stress/total antioxidant status markers and haemostatic parameters which are in favor of cross talk between haemostasis and oxidative stress in acute leukemia.
