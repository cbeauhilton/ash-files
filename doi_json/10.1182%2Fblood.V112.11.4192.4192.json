    "abstract_text": "Background: Modern therapy diminished prognostic significance of serum \u03b22M level. Aims: This study was designed to investigate the correlation between the number of lymphocytes expressing \u03b22M, serum \u03b22M level, and the results of treatment. Methods: 45 patients (pts) were included (Binet stage B, 36 and C, 9). \u03b22M expression on the lymphocyte surface was detected with immunocytochemical method by means of Dako-Cytomation LSAB2 System HRP, \u03b22M serum level by ELISA. Results: In 29 pts \u03b22M was expressed on 80\u2013100% of lymphocytes (group I), in 16 pts on 35\u201379% (group II). Number of lymphocytes expressing \u03b22M did not correlate with lumphocyte dimension, form of nucleus, and presence of prolymphocytes in peripheral blood (PB). \u03b22M serum level ranged from 3,0 to 10,5 mg/L. Number of leukocytes and lymphocytes in PB and bone marrow in both groups had no difference. Number of pts with normal \u03b22M serum level (3,5 mg/L or less) was practically the same (group I, 13,8%; group II, 18,8%). Among pts with high \u03b22M serum level (> 6 mg/L) there were 28% in group I and 69,0% in group II. Increased level of LDG (>450 MU/L) was detected in 10% of pts of group I and in 50% in group II. Treatment in both groups was similar: regimens with fludarabine\u2013gr.I, 23 of 29 pts and gr.II, 12 of 16; R-COP\u2013gr.I, 3 pts and gr.II, 2 pts. Two pts in gr.II received leukeran; 3 pts in gr.I didn\u2019t need any treatment. Of 42 pts treated 20 pts achieved complete remission; 13, partial remission, and 9 pts failed. In gr.I complete remission was achieved in 17 of 26 treated pts (65,4%), in gr.II, in 3 of 16 (18,8%), p=0,0038. Partial remission was received in 6 pts of gr.I (23,1%) and in 7 pts (43,8%) of gr.II, p=0,14. Three pts of gr.I (11,5%) and 6 pts of gr.II (37,2%) failed (p=0,05). Conclusion: Comparison of the therapy results showed that \u03b22M expression on large number (80\u2013100%) of lymphocytes in B-CLL can be considered as the favourable prognostic sign. It was associated with lower level (<6 mg/L) of serum \u03b22M (in 71,2% vs. 31% of pts, p=0,009) and LDG (90% vs. 50% of pts, p=0,0051). Disclosure: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
