    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2884 Background Auto-antigenic targets of the B-cell receptor (BCR) derived from malignant cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) might play a role in the pathogenesis of this neoplasm. Patients and Methods In order to identify autoantigenic targets of CLL-derived BCR we screened human tissue-derived protein macroarrays with Fab fragments obtained by papain treatment of CLL cells derived from 50 consecutive cases. Antigens were biochemically and molecularly characterized and recombinantly expressed. Results An autoantigenic target was identified for 12/50 (24%) of the cases, with 3 autoantigens being the target of the BCR from two patients each. CLL-BCR derived from the same stereotype subset recognized the same antigen, but differed epitopes. By flow cytometry using flag-tagged recombinantly expressed autoantigens binding of antigen to the surface of CLL was demonstrated, which was specific for the CLL cells from which the BCR used for the identification of the respective autoantigen was derived. Moreover, binding of the autoantigen to the respective leukemic cells induced specific activation as shown by increased cytoplasmic calcium concentration, induced MYC expression and proliferation of leukemic CLL cells as demonstrated by a proliferation assay (EZ4U). Conclusions Autoantigens are frequent targets of CLL-derived BCR. Their specific binding to and induction of proliferation in respective leukemic cells, which has been demonstrated for the first time, provide the most convincing evidence to date for the long-time hypothesized role of autoantigens in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocyte leukemia.
