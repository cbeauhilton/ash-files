    "abstract_text": "Epidemiological, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutical data were retrospectively obtained by the Italian Registry in over 2000 Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) patients who mainly were diagnosed according to the PVSG criteria and were treated with potentially leukemogenic drugs. The Registro Italiano Trombocitemie (RIT), that is a GIMEMA project, has been activated in order to registry italian ET patients, to improve the diagnosis appropriateness (WHO criteria), to promote the acquisition of biological data, to evaluate the compliance to the therapeutical guidelines of the Italian Society of Hematology (SIE), to monitor in particular the ET patients receiving Interferons alpha and Anagrelide, to evaluate cases of pregnancy, pediatric age and familiarity, to define the prognostic value of the biological factors as JAK2 mutation, clonality, etc, to create a network for activation of new clinical and biological studies. The RIT, co-ordinated by the Hematology Unit of Reggio Emilia, is a web based registry that beside a public area comprehends a database of italian ET patients. The data, with respect of the privacy rules, are object of validation and analysis by various RIT expert subcommittees. Eighty hematological Institutions adhered to the RIT and 801 patients have been registered since June 2005. The ET diagnosis was done according to the PVSG (90%) and WHO (10%) criteria. The patients, 492 females and 309 males, had age 70 yr (30%), and the median age was 59 years. At diagnosis the platelet count was >1000 \u00d710 9 /L in 29% of cases (mean 932). Few patients had prior thrombosis (4%; major 2%) and prior hemorrhage (2.6%). Patients at high risk of thrombosis were 55% on considering age >60 yr and/or previous thrombosis and/or PLT count >1500 \u00d710 9 /L, and 65% on considering the PLT count cut-off of 1000 \u00d710 9 /L. The patients shown general thrombotic risk factors (70%), disease related symptoms (40%) and splenomegaly (25%). By applying the WHO diagnostic criteria, the picture of true ET was found in 27% of cases. Sixty pregnancies have been reported. Aspirin was administered in 72% of patients and cytoreduction was performed in 62% of them, with use of Hydroxyurea (65%), Anagrelide (10%), Interferons alpha (10%), Pipobroman (4%), Busulfan (2%). A separate analysis for patients treated with Anagrelide and Iterferons alpha is in progress. To improve the diagnostic approach, the RIT has promoted the bone marrow biopsy revision (WHO criteria) and the acquisition of the new biological parameters.",
