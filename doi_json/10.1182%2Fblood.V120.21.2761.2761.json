    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2761 Clinical outcome of patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) remains poor with currently available therapies. Recently, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) appears to play an important role in the development of resistance in MCL and some subtypes of DLBCL. Targeting UPS represents a rational approach in an attempt to eradicate drug-resistant lymphoma clones. MLN4924 is a novel, potent and selective inhibitor of the NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) that is necessary for the modification of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases. We evaluated the anti-tumor activity of MLN4924 against a panel of rituximab-sensitive (RSCL) or rituximab/chemotherapy\u2013resistant (RCRCL) DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, cytarabine-sensitive or -resistant (AraCR) MCL cell lines, and primary tumor cells freshly isolated from lymphoma patients (n=13). Lymphoma cells were exposed to escalating doses of MLN4924 alone or in combination with selected chemotherapy agents for up to 72 hrs. Changes in the cell viability or ATP content were determined by alamar Blue reduction or CellTiterGlo assays, respectively. Induction of apoptosis and changes in the levels of NFkB and UPS regulatory proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Cell cycle alterations were determined by propidium iodide staining and NFkB activity was quantified by flow cytometry using the Imagestream technology. MLN4924 demonstrated time- and dose-dependent anti-lymphoma activity in all cell lines tested. The IC 50 in RSCLs were Raji=400nM, RL=1uM and U2932=>3uM. All RCRCLs were less responsive to MLN4924 as a single agent with IC 50 concentrations 4\u201310\u00d7 those of their respective sensitive parental cell lines. The MCL cell lines Mino, MinoAraCR, Z-138, HBL-2 and HBL-2AraCR were most sensitive to MLN4924 anti-tumor effects (IC 50 =250nM) with no significant difference between cytarabine-sensitive and -resistant cell lines; while the MCL cell lines Rec-1, Rec-1AraCR, Jeko-1 and Jeko-1AraCR were less sensitive (IC 50 =500\u20131000nM). A variable degree of anti-tumor activity was also observed in primary lymphoma cells. In addition to single-agent activity, MLN4924 plus selected anti-lymphoma chemotherapy agents (bortezomib, bendamustine and cytarabine) demonstrated synergy in cytarabine-sensitive and (to a lesser degree) cytarabine-resistant MCL cell lines. Combinations with additional chemotherapeutic agents (doxorubicin and vincristine) resulted in additive effects. Exposure of MCL cells to MLN4924 resulted in G1 cell cycle arrest. In vitro exposure of the more sensitive MCL cell lines Mino and MinoAraCR to MLN4924 resulted in an increase in p-IkB\u03b1 and down-regulation of both total and nuclear NFkB. The less sensitive cell lines Rec-1 and Rec-1AraCR demonstrated little to no change in NFkB activation following exposure to MLN4924. Additional studies are ongoing to further define the molecular mechanisms of the anti-tumor activity observed following NAE inhibition by MLN4924 in these pre-clinical models and to further evaluate the activity of MLN4924 in in vivo SCID mouse models of B-cell lymphoma. Our data suggests that MLN4924, a novel NAE inhibitor, is active against B-cell lymphomas, particularly MCL, and is a promising agent warranting further investigation in relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell lymphomas.
