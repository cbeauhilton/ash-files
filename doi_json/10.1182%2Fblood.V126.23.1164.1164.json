    "abstract_text": "Background: Erythrocyte and granulocyte/macrophage develop from common myeloid progenitor (CMP) (Akashi et al., 2000). Differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells is precisely controlled by multiple transcription factors, among which GATA1, C/EBP\u03b1, C/EBP\u03b2 and Spi-C play pivotal roles in erythrocyte and granulocyte/macrophage differentiation (Mancini et al., 2012; Pongubala et al., 2008; Hirai et al., 2006; Haldar et al., 2014). However, the mechanism by which the differentiation of CMP controlled under infectious condition has been unclear. Bach1 and Bach2 belong to the basic region-leucine zipper family and recognize Maf-recognition elements (Oyake et al., 1996). They promote B cell development by repressing the myeloid genes such as Cebpb and Spic in common lymphoid progenitor cells (Itoh-Nakadai et al., 2014). In addition, Bach1 regulates several target genes related to iron/heme homeostasis such as globin genes and hemeoxygenase-1, and Bach2 may similarly regulate these genes (Igarashi, 2014). Therefore, it is expected that both Bach1 and Bach2 play redundant roles in erythropoiesis. To figure out their roles in erythroid and myeloid cell differentiation, we performed hematological and transcriptomics analyses using Bach1 -/- Bach2 -/- (double-deficient; DD) mice. Methods: The generation of DD mice on the C57BL/6J background and Bach2 reporter mice with red fluorescent protein coding cDNA inserted in the Bach2 locus were described previously (Itoh-Nakadai et al., 2014). Mice between 8-12 weeks old were analyzed in the present study. Bone marrow (BM) cells were stained with specific combinations of antibodies to identify erythroid/myeloid progenitor and mature cells (Sheila et al., 2008; Cornelis et al., 2007; Socolovsky et al., 2001). Flow cytometry analysis and cell sorting were performed by using FACSAria\u2161(BD) and FlowJo software (TreeStar). For infectious simulation of CMP, sorted CMPs were incubated with 1\u03bcg/ml LPS (Sigma) for 48h and RNA was purified with RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen). Quantitative PCR by using Superscript\u2162 reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and Light Cycler system (Roche) was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Microarray analysis by using Sure-Print G3 mouse GE microarray slide (Agilent) was performed as previously described (Itoh-Nakadai et al., 2014) and the results were analyzed by using GeneSpring software (Agilent). We used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to interpret gene expression data (Subramanian et al., 2005; Mootha et al., 2003). LPS stimulation (50 \u03bcg/body) of mice was performed as previously described (Ryan et al., 2008). Data were analyzed by the two-sided Student's t-test and p - values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: DD mice show mild normocytic anemia compered to wild-type (WT), Bach1 -/- , and Bach2 -/- mice (hemoglobin; 14.4\u00b10.2, 14.0\u00b10.3, 13.5\u00b10.3 and 11.9\u00b10.7 g/dl, for WT, Bach1 -/- , Bach2 -/- and DD, respectively, p<0.05 for comparison between DD and other genotypes, n=7). Immature and mature erythroblast populations were significantly decreased in BM of DD (immature; 25.8\u00b11.78, 15.6\u00b11.4, mature; 27.6\u00b13.3, 17.4\u00b12.3\u00d710 6 /body for WT and DD, respectively, p<0.05, n=6). Megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor (MEP)/granulocyte-monocyte progenitor (GMP) ratio was significantly decreased in BM of DD (MEP/GMP: 0.13\u00b10.01, 0.07\u00b10.01 for WT and DD, respectively, p<0.05, n=5). Bach2 expression was detected in CMP, MEP and even GMP by using Bach2-RFP mice. LPS stimulation of WT CMP significantly decreased mRNA levels of Bach1 , Bach2 and Gata1 . On the other hand, Cebpb and Spic mRNA levels were significantly increased. LPS stimulation of WT mice induced significant increase of granulocyte and decrease of erythrocyte and B lymphocyte in BM, which was consistent with previous reports. It was also shown that LPS stimulation significantly decreased MEP/ GMP ratio. According to the clustering analysis of the microarray data of CMP sorted from WT and DD mice, they showed clearly different expression profiles. GSEA showed that CMP of DD skewed to myeloid cell lineage and lost the erythroid gene expression compared to WT. Conclusions: Bach1 and Bach2 control the differentiation of CMP to erythroid cell or myeloid cell by repressing myeloid genes such as Cebpb and Spic . Infectious stimuli may promote myeloid cell differentiation by reducing the expression of Bach1 and Bach2 in CMP. Disclosures Fujiwara: Chugai Pharmaceutical CO., LTD: Research Funding.
