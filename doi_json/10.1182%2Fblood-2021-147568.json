    "abstract_text": "Up to 70% of large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) patients will eventually experience relapse or progress following CD19-CAR-T therapy. Data guiding management of this challenging population are lacking. Therefore, we aimed to study the relationship between treatment strategies and outcomes following CD19-CAR-T failure. We included 273 adults, from two centers, treated with CD19-CAR-T (axicabtagene-ciloleucel [98, 36%], tisagenlecleucel [76, 28%], lisocabtagene-maraleucel [28, 10%], and an academic CD28-product [71, 26%]) for relapsed/refractory LBCL Cumulative incidence of relapse or progression was 40% (95% CI: 34%, 46%). Of 176 patients with residual or relapsed disease post-CAR-T (Fig. A), 133 received subsequent first-line anti-cancer therapy for active or residual disease ( primary cohort ) at a median of 79 days (interquartile range 49-124) after CAR-T infusion. Within the primary cohort, 65% of patients had stage III-IV disease at time of subsequent therapy. Most lymphomas remained CD19-positive after CAR-T therapy (45 biopsies, 91% positive by flow cytometry [58% normal, 33% dim expression]). At time of first treatment post-CAR-T, nearly all patients had either relapsed disease or stable/progressive disease (SD/PD), with eight patients in ongoing partial response (PR). With a median follow-up of 14.5 months (95% CI: 11.5-21.4), the median overall survival (OS) from time of first subsequent therapy was 8.6 months (IQR 6.9-12.0). We sought to identify determinants of survival among patients receiving initial post-CAR-T treatment. Variables measured pre- and post-CAR-T therapy and significantly associated (p < 0.1) with OS in univariable Cox regression were introduced into a multivariable model. Age \u2265 65y (HR 2.01 [95% CI: 1.23-3.29], p 0.005), bulky disease at apheresis (HR 2.05 [1.07-3.95], p 0.031), and disease refractory to CAR-T therapy (HR 1.89 [1.19-2.98], p 0.007) were associated with inferior OS in the multivariable analysis. Based on the cumulative burden of OS determinants, we propose a prognostic tool allowing risk stratification of patients receiving treatment post-CAR-T. Increasing number of these three risk factors was associated with greater mortality (HR 1.86 [1.32-2.62], p<0.001; Fig. B). Six-month OS ranged from 30% (95% CI: [16-57]) with \u2265 2 factors to 76% (64-91) with none. Therapy strategies post-CAR-T varied. Polatuzumab (n=25), anthracycline or platinum (\"chemotherapy\"; n=17), BTK inhibitors (n=13) and lenalidomide (n=12) based treatment were most frequently administered for non-localized disease (stage \u22652). Involved site radiation therapy (ISRT; n=20) was primarily given for stage I disease (Fig. C). Overall response rate (ORR) in the entire cohort was 47% (25% CR; 22% PR). Fig. D shows response rates by treatment. Remarkably, novel agents, including polatuzumab and lenalidomide-based therapies, had ORR of 52% (CR 35%) and 33% (CR 33%), respectively. In contrast, traditional chemotherapy-based approaches did not result in CR, and only 50% achieved PR. Survival was poorest with chemotherapy (6 month OS: 25% [95% CI: [11-59]), while rates with lenalidomide and polatuzumab-based therapies were 65% (42-100) and 67% (50-89). Patients and disease characteristics across treatment groups were unbalanced. However, the three prognostic factors comprising the OS prognostic tool: age \u2265 65y, bulky disease at apheresis and disease refractoriness to CAR-T, were similar across lenalidomide, polatuzumab, checkpoint inhibitors, and chemotherapy-based treatment groups. Patients who underwent alloHCT were significantly younger but achieved high rates of response. In conclusion, we present the most extensive and detailed experience of treatment outcomes post-CAR-T therapy. Our data suggest that novel agents may be preferable to traditional chemotherapies as the first post-CAR-T treatment. However, survival is still poor, and investigation of curative approaches is needed. We provide a tool to inform mortality risk in this difficult-to-treat population.
