    "article_date": "November 16, 2004",

    "abstract_text": "We performed immunophenotypic and IgV H mutation analyses on the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells of 307 patients for expression of CD38, ZAP-70, and IgV H mutation status to determine the relative strength of each in predicting the need for early treatment. For this we assessed the time from diagnosis to initial therapy for progressive and/or symptomatic disease. Patients confirmed to have remained untreated were censored for this endpoint. Expression of CD38 was defined as the proportion of CD38-stained CLL cells that had fluorescence intensity above a defined threshold. Similarly, cases were defined as ZAP-70 + when 20% or more of the ZAP-70-stained CLL cells had fluorescence intensity above a defined threshold, as described ( NEJM  351 : 893 , 2004 ). CLL cells were classified as expressing mutated IgV H genes if they expressed IgV H with <98% homology with a known germline IgV H gene. The median percentage of cells expressing CD38 in our cohort was 11.5% (range 0.1% to 99.5%). In patients with multiple samples, the CD38 expression level appeared constant over time, with a median S.D. of 0.8%. We defined patient samples that had CD38 expression levels at or below the median as having low expression. There was a significant association between low expression of CD38 and lack of ZAP-70 or expression of a mutated IgV H (p < 0.0001 for each assessment by the Fisher exact test). Median level of CD38 among cases expressing mutated IgV H was 4.0%, compared to 27.4% among cases expressing unmutated IgV H (p < 0.0001 by the Wilcoxon rank sum test). Median level of CD38 among ZAP-70 negative cases was 5.3%, compared to 27.2% among ZAP-70 + cases (p < 0.0001 by the Wilcoxon rank sum test). Patients with low-level expression of CD38 had a median time to initiation of therapy of 8.2 years; whereas, patients with high-level expression of CD38 had a median time to initiation of therapy of 4.0 years (p<0.0001). Although high-level expression of CD38 was associated with a shorter time from diagnosis to initiation of therapy (p < 0.0001 in a Cox proportional hazards regression), the inclusion of IgV H mutation status (p < 0.0001) or expression of ZAP-70 (p < 0.0001) in these models reduced the contribution of CD38 status to a p-value of 0.051 (ZAP-70 model) or 0.052 (mutation status model). Although ZAP-70 expression and mutation status each contributed significantly to the hazard of initiating therapy in a Cox proportional hazards model, high-level expression of CD38 did not add significantly to the model that already addresses ZAP-70 and mutational status, p=0.425. As such, although knowledge of the CD38 expression level can be used as a predictor of the time from diagnosis to the initiation of therapy it provides only marginal value if either the IgV H mutational status or expression of ZAP-70 is known and no value if knowledge of both ZAP-70 expression and IgV H mutational status is available.",
