    "abstract_text": "Introduction Patients with follicular lymphomas (FL) often follow an indolent disease course initiated with the wait-and-watch approach. Chemotherapy, including rituximab (R), is inevitably required in most patients though. R-maintenance is indicated for patients achieving a partial or complete remission based results from randomized clinical trials and confirmed by meta-analyses demonstrating a prolonged progression free survival. A benefit in overall survival (OS), however, has yet to be established in the first line setting. Patients and methods We completed a retrospective analysis in patients extracted from the Danish National Lymphoma Register. Eligible patient data included histopathological confirmation of FL diagnosed in the period 2000-2014 who received R-Chemotherapy as first line treatment and surviving a minimum 1 year after treatment initiation. A Cox regression model was performed, adjusted for age, gender, stage, response rates and treatment period (pre-maintenance era (year 2000-2010) vs. maintenance era (year 2011-2014)) with hazard ratio (HR) of OS as the primary endpoint. All patients were followed until June 2016. Results 1037 patients were extracted from the register. 481 patients received R-maintenance (RM-group) and 556 patients did not. The median age was 62 (26-90), 526 (51%) were male, LDH was elevated in 325 (31%) and 436 (42%) had a high FLIPI index. The median follow-up time was 6.3 years. The five year OS for all patients was 86%. A significant change in the chemotherapy regimens was observed between the two groups, since Bendamustine was more frequently used in the maintenance group. A significant lower HR was observed in the RM group with a HR of 0.63 (95% CI 0.44 - 0.88, P = 0.008). Furthermore, gender proved of significance, with a HR for men of 1.78 (95% CI 1.32-2.40, P < 0.001). Conclusions Rituximab maintenance treatment following first line immunochemotherapy in patients with follicular lymphoma improved survival in a large population based cohort of patients and consolidates this strategy as part of the standard of care in this patient group.
