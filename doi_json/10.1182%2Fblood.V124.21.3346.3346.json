    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Malignant transformation of normal to tumour cells is a multistep process followed by sequential aggregation of hits at different molecular levels. Genetic events including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertion-deletion changes (indels) as well as copy number variants (CNVs) affect the phenotype of the tumour population and consequently patient prognosis. Transformation from a symptomless state, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) to multiple myeloma (MM) can be used as a unique model for cancer development studies. To date, there is very little data regarding the mechanisms leading to disease progression at molecular level. In our study, we performed exome sequencing together with SNP array analysis on 33 MGUS patients to describe the premalignant phenotype and compared these to advanced tumour cells at the DNA level. We hypothesised that increased genetic instability indicated MGUS patients with a high risk of progression to MM. Methods: 33 MGUS patients (M:F 1.5:3; median age 61, range: 35-86) were included in this study. Plasma cells were isolated from bone marrow by FACSAria (BD Biosciences) system using CD138, CD19 and CD56 markers to obtain a pure abnormal plasma cell population with a purity >90%. Tumour DNA was isolated using Gentra Puregene Kit and amplified using REPLI-g Midi Kit (both Qiagen); control DNA was gained from peripheral white blood cells by MagNA Pure System (Roche Diagnostics). For exome sequencing, NEBNext kit (NEB) and SureSelect Human All Exon V5 (Agilent Technologies) were used and samples were sequenced by HiSeq2000 (Illumina) using 76-bp paired end reads. Unbalanced CNVs were tested by SurePrint G3 CGH+SNP, 4x180K (Agilent Technologies). Results were compared to 463 MM patients. Results: In our analysis, we found acquired SNVs in 100% (33/33) MGUS patients with a median of 89 (range 9-315) SNVs per patient. Non-synonymous SNVs (NS-SNVs) were present in 97% (32/33) cases with a median 19 (range 0\u201370) NS-SNVs per patient. Overall, 42 genes were recurrently mutated in at least 2 patients and 6 genes were mutated in at least 3 cases including MUC16 , IGK , TTN , KLHL6 , AKAP9 and NPIPL2 . We identified 7 genes which were significantly mutated in MM in our previous study including KRAS (n=2), HIST1H1E (n=2) and NRAS , DIS3 , EGR1 , LTB , PRKD2 (all n=1). IGH translocations were identified in 27% (9/33) of patients: t(11;14) in 12% (4/33), t(4;14) in 9% (3/33), t(14;16) in 3% (1/33) and t(14;20) in 3% (1/33). We did not find any translocations involving MYC (8q24.21) or the light chain loci IGK (2p12) and IGL (22q11.2). Using SNP arrays, unbalanced CNVs were presented in 67% (22/33) of MGUS patients and detected CNVs showed similarity to MM across the cohort. As previously described in MM, only one type of IGH translocation was found per patient and all 9 cases with IGH translocation did not have additional hyperdiploidy. Furthermore, we identified a patient with two CCND1 (p.K50T, p.E51D) mutations and a t(11;14), a case with a DIS3 (p.D488N) mutation and a 13q loss. Moreover, we noticed a co-segregation of cases t(4;14) and t(14;16) who all had a 13q loss (100%, 4/4). In contrast none of the patients (0/5) with a t(11;14) or a t(14;20) had a 13q loss. Of note 29% (7/24) patients without any IGH translocation had a 13q loss. Sixty seven percent (2/3) of patients with a t(4;14) and the one case with a t(14;16) also had a 1q gain. In comparison, none of patients with a t(11;14) (0%; 0/4) had a 1q gain. Unlike what has previously been described in MM, neither of the 2 MGUS patients with a KRAS (p.Q61L and p.A146T) mutations had a t(11;14). We also identified a patient with both a KRAS (p.Q61L) and an NRAS (p.G13R) mutation which are although not mutually exclusive, negatively correlated in MM. Importantly, we did not find any mutations in TP53 , ATM , ATR and ZFHX4 genes involved in DNA repair pathway alterations which were identified as unfavourable factors in survival of MM patients. Summary: We have performed the first comprehensive analysis of 33 MGUS patients using exome sequencing together with SNP arrays and described the main genetic events that are already present in this premalignant state. We found similarities to MM in terms of SNVs, CNVs and their correlations. We identified 6 MGUS cases with NS-SNVs in potential key genes that could indicate a potential high risk to progression.
