    "abstract_text": "Introduction B cell Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL) is characterized by the accumulation of monoclonal malignant CD5+ B cells that show resistance to apoptosis in vivo , but are susceptible to apoptosis when incubated in vitro . A number of cytokines have been reported to protect against apoptosis in vitro , but it is not clear whether the effects of these cytokines are mediated in similar ways. We have therefore studied the regulation of apoptosis in B-CLL cells in vitro , in response to various cytokines. Methods B-CLL cells were purified and incubated with the following agents; Interferon-gamma, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, TNF-alpha and GM-CSF, each at 3 different concentrations. Apoptosis was measured after 70 hours by Annexin/PI staining and analysed for early apoptosis (Annexin V positive), late apoptotic (Annexin V and PI positive), and necrotic (PI positive). Results The percentage of live cells in unstimulated B-CLL cells was 42.4\u00b12.3%. Co-incubation of B-CLL cells with IL-4 at 100ng/ml increased the percentage of live cells to 63.2\u00b18.4%, while in the presence of interferon-gamma the percentage of live cells was 48.7\u00b15.9%. In contrast, co-incubation with TNF-alpha reduced the percentage of live cells to 30.8\u00b16.8%. IL-10, IL-13 and GM-CSF had no effect on B-CLL cells survival at any of the concentrations used.. No significant differences in the pattern of early/late apoptosis or necrosis were seen between the different cytokines used. View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure "
