    "abstract_text": "All trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been used in differentiation therapy for APL and other types of cancers. However, the rapid emergence of ATRA resistance due in part to ATRA-induced acceleration of ATRA metabolism limits its use. A novel strategy to overcome the limitation associated with exogenous ATRA therapy has been developed by inhibiting the cytochrome P450-dependent ATRA-4-hydroxylase enzyme responsible for ATRA metabolism. These inhibitors are referred to as RAMBAs. Novel RAMBAs were developed which demonstrated a superior apoptosis, cell growth inhibition, in vivo anti-tumor effect in addition to the differentiation effect in breast cancer cell lines ( Patel JB et al. J. Med. Chem  2004 , 47 : 6716 ). We tested 3 RAMBAs, VN/14-1, 50-1, and 66-1 to investigate their activities against APL cell lines. RAMBAs did not confer cytotoxicity or apoptosis induction in vitro at the concentration between 0.5 to 5 \u03bcM as opposed to breast or prostate cancer cell lines. However, the differentiation effect was demonstrated by morphological and phenotypic changes using Wright-Giemsa stain and CD11b staining measured by flow cytometric analysis. VN/14-1 and VN/66-1 induced differentiation and apoptosis morphologically and phenotypically in HL60 cells. VN/14-1 and VN/50-1 showed superior differentiation in NB4 cell line compared to ATRA (70%, 69%, and 45%, respectively). Interestingly, HL60 ATRA resistant cell line was induced to undergo differentiation by VN/14-1 (0.5\u03bcM) at 55% whereas ATRA (0.5, 1, 5\u03bcM) showed less than 5% by flow cytometry analysis. VN/14-1 inhibited cell cycle at S phase whereas ATRA did not attenuate the cell cycle at the same concentration. We also tested the effect of RAMBAs on human CD34+ enriched cell colony formation. RAMBAs were added to the methylcellulose culture plates with CD34+ cells and colonies were determined after 14 days. There was no difference in the CFU-GM or BFU-E colony count between the control and the RAMBAs group. In summary, RAMBAs are promising differentiation agents in the treatment of APL, possibly through an inhibition of Cyp26A leading to increased endogenous ATRA levels. In addition, cell cycle inhibition may be a mechanism of differentiation induction in ATRA resistant cell lines. RAMBAs did not affect normal hematopoietic stem cells. We are currently testing whether RAMBAs can induce acetylation of histones in APL cell lines."
