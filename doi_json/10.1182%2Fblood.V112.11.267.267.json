    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Blinatumomab (MT103/MEDI-538), a BiTE antibody targeting the CD19 antigen, is a member of a novel class of molecules that redirect T cells for lysis of target cells. A Phase 1 dose escalation study is being conducted in patients with advanced NHL. Methods : Relapsed NHL patients requiring treatment were included. Most patients were pre-treated, with a median of 3 previous chemo/immunotherapy regimens. To date, 7 dose levels ranging from 0.0005 to 0.09 mg/m 2 /24 h have been tested. Blinatumomab was continuously infused as single agent over a period of 4\u20138 weeks. Objective responses were assessed by Cheson criteria and centrally reviewed. Results: To date 39 patients have been treated. Most common adverse events (AEs) included lymphopenia, pyrexia, and leukopenia. The majority of AEs (>95%) improved or resolved during treatment. Permanent treatment discontinuation due to AEs occurred in a total of 8 patients, of which 6 had fully reversible CNS events. One patient with a history of nearly fatal sepsis, pre-existing hypogammaglobulinemia and bone marrow affection by chemotherapy, experienced a fatal sepsis 5 weeks after treatment start. Dose-dependent activity was observed in mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and CLL with responses observed in 11 out of 27 patients treated at doses of 0.015 mg/m 2 /24 h and higher. Five of those patients had complete and six had partial responses. At the dose level of 0.060 mg/m 2 /24 h, 7 out of 7 patients have shown objective responses. Beside one relapse after 14 months, no treatment failure has so far been observed for responders at dose levels of 0.030 mg/m 2 /24 h and 0.060 mg/m 2 /24 h. Five patients at these dose levels have ongoing responses for more than 6 months. Interestingly, partial remissions converted into complete remissions in two patients four weeks after end of infusion suggesting either reduction in lesion size due to efflux of a previously expanded T cell pool or prolonged T cell activity. Conclusions: Blinatumomab as single agent induced apparently durable responses in pre-treated B-NHL patients with the highest response rate at a dose level of 0.06 mg/m 2 /24 h. Recruitment is ongoing.",
