    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2918 Natural killer cells (NK) have the unique ability to kill target cells without priming. While their therapeutic potential against various malignancies is becoming more apparent, it has been restricted to the allogeneic setting; NK cells are inhibited by autologous targets by engaging killer immunoglobulin-like receptors with their ligands. Another major challenge to the clinical utility of NK cells is obtaining a sufficient number of NK cells for infusion. Co-culture of blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) with the leukemic cell line K562, genetically modified to express membrane-bound IL15 and the co-stimulatory molecule 41BBL (K562mbIL15-41BBL) in the presence of IL2 results in robust expansion and activation of NK cells. To determine if NK cells derived from myeloma (MM) patients can be used therapeutically in the autologous setting, we explored the expansion of NK cells from MM patients, their gene expression profiles (GEP), and their ability to kill autologous and allogeneic MM cells from high-risk patients in vitro and in vivo , and compared these to NK cells from healthy donors (HD). PBMNC from MM patients (N=30) co-cultured with irradiated K562mbIL15-41BBL cells expanded a median of 351 fold (range20\u201310, 430), comparable to the expansion of HD-derived NK cells (N=15, median 803, range 127\u20131, 727; p=0.5). GEP of MM non-exp-NK differed from HD non-exp-NK in the expression of only one gene ( PRKCi ), underexpessed in MM (false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05, p-value <3\u00d710 \u221210 ). GEP of exp-NK cells from both MM patients and HD was very different from non-exp-NK cells (8 pairs each, 10, 639 differentially overexpressed and 26, 057 underexpressed probe sets, FDR <0.05). Genes associated with proliferation, cytolytic activity, activation, adhesion, migration and cell cycle regulation were highly up-regulated in exp-NK cells. Standard chromium release assays demonstrated that MM exp-NK cells killed both allogeneic and autologous primary MM cells more efficiently compared to non-exp-NK cells, via a perforin mediated mechanism. Blocking studies revealed that the natural cytotoxicity receptors, activating receptors, and DNAX accessory molecule (DNAM-1) played a central role in target cell lysis. The killing ability of MM patient and HD derived exp-NK cells was very similar against allogeneic targets, while primary MM targets were more resistant to killing by autologous exp-NK. The anti-MM activity of allogeneic and autologous exp-NK cells was further examined in vivo . NOD/SCID/IL2R \u03b3-null mice were implanted subcutaneously with a human fetal bone, and primary MM cells or luciferase-transfected OPM2 MM cell line were engrafted into the bone. The tumor burden was determined by ELISA for human Ig and/or bio-imaging. The mice were randomized to control and exp-NK treatment groups. A total of 160 \u00d710 6 exp-NK cells, in 4 doses 48 hrs apart, were injected in the exp-NK treatment group via tail vein injection. The mice were administered 1000U of IL2 subcu daily to support the NK cells. The mice were bled on days 7, 14, 21 & 28 for the assessment of human Ig by ELISA and enumerating circulating NK cells by flow cytometry. Exp-NK treated mice had a significantly reduced MM burden by ELISA (p<0.04) on day 21, and exp-NK could be detected in the murine blood up to day 28 post-administration in both primary MM and OPM2 tumor bearing mice. The mice were sacrificed and the tumors were harvested after 4 weeks. A noticeable reduction in tumor burden in the exp-NK cell treated mice was confirmed by histology. NK cells were detected by immunohistochemistry (CD57 or CD16) in the hu-bone implants harvested 28 days after infusion. In conclusion, MM patient-derived NK cells have a similar expansion potential, and MM exp-NK cells have cytolytic activity against allogeneic targets similar to those of HD exp-NK cells, and somewhat reduced activity against autologous targets. These exp-NK cells have significant activity against the aggressive cell line OPM2 and high-risk autologous primary MM cells in vivo . Exp-NK cells trafficked to MM tumors and persisted in the myelomatous hu bone microenvironment for 4 weeks. The anti-MM activity of autologous exp-NK cells is exciting and avails a new therapeutic avenue for patients with GEP-defined high-risk disease. A phase II clinical trial of allogeneic and autologous exp-NK cell therapy for relapsed/refractory high-risk MM is in progress at our institution.
