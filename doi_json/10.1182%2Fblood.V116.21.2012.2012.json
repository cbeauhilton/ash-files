    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2012 In the biology of thrombopoiesis, several challenging issues such as polyploidy induction, proplatelet formation with endomitotic maturation and tubular cytoplasmic projections, and ability of cell division as reported in human platelets, have not been elucidated sufficiently. Comparative characterization of thrombocyte developments in animals may bring about a new perspective. Characteristics of thrombocyte precursors as megakaryocytes (MKs) and mature thrombocytes in most vertebrates, however, remain poorly defined. Most non-mammalian vertebrates have nucleated and spindle thrombocytes instead of platelets. Since african clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, is one of the most popular species providing various animal models in embryology and physiology, we attempt to establish an adult Xenopus model for analyses of hematopoiesis. We clarified peripheral thrombocytes by various staining methods, and searched immature thrombocytic cells in Xenopus organs. When peripheral blood cells were subjected to acetylcholinesterase staining, thrombocytes in the circulation, i.e. mature thrombocytes were positively identified. The size of elliptical mature thrombocytes was approx. 20.5\u00b10.6 \u03bcm by 7.6\u00b11.1 \u03bcm in diameters on cytocentrifuge preparations. We produced monoclonal antibody to Xenopus mature thrombocytes (T12) previously. The subsequent flow cytometry with a FACSAria II cell sorter revealed that the proportion of the peripheral T12-positive thrombocytes in lower FSC and SSC ranges were 1.5\u00b10.3% of whole peripheral blood cells, and the expression of Xenopus c-Mpl ( xl Mpl) mRNA in the sorted cells was detected by RT-PCR. The mRNA expressions of Xenopus TPO ( xl TPO) and xl Mpl were also detected predominantly in the spleen and the liver, indicating that the sites of thrombocyte progenitor-residing organ and thrombopoietic activity-releasing organ were coincident in adult Xenopus . This resembled the relationship between Xenopus erythropoietin (EPO) and EPO receptor-expressing erythrocytic progenitors, as we have reported (Nogawa-Kosaka et al , 2010, Exp Hematol). Next, immunohistochemical analysis with T12 antibody revealed that thrombocytic cells were localized in sinusoid of the liver and the spleen. We then performed a thrombocytic colony assay in the presence of recombinant xl TPO expressed in E. coli . Hepatic and splenic cells composed of respective 80,000 cells in 1mL were incubated in 35mm dishes at 23\u00b0C under 5% CO 2 with 0.87% methylcellulose-based semi-solid medium containing 20% FCS and xl TPO (5 ng/ml). The xl TPO-induced colonies derived from the spleen, including T12 positive thrombocytic colonies, emerged after 2 days, and the number reached to 65\u00b12 in the culture (1 mL). The number of liver-derived colonies was smaller than that of spleen-derived ones, indicating that the density of thrombocyte progenitors in Xenopus was higher in the spleen, but the total mass of thrombocyte progenitors in the body is mostly distributed in the liver based on ratio by organ weights. In Xenopus , moderate thrombocytopenia, as well as anemia, was induced by phenylhydrazine (PHZ). The nadir of circulating thrombocyte counts was observed 4 days after PHZ-administration. When we culture cells of the liver or the spleen in the presence of the PHZ-induced thrombocytopenic serum, colonies composed of white cells and red cells were developed, suggesting that multiple or bipotent hematopoietic progenitors existed. When the hepatic cells were stimulated by xl TPO (5 ng/ml) for 2 days in the liquid culture, T12-positive megakaryocytic larger cells with multinucleated spherical shapes (approx. 30 \u00b13 \u03bcm in diameter) appeared, and such cells did not appear under EPO stimulation. On the other hand, the size of megakaryocytic cells derived from the spleen was smaller. Regardless of the origin of the thrombocyte progenitors, the cells stimulated by xl TPO in the liquid cultures expressed mRNAs of c-Mpl, CD41 and Fli-1, demonstrating that thrombocyte progenitors at different development stages resided in the liver and the spleen. It is still a missing piece of the puzzle whether Xenopus thrombocyte progenitors or mature thrombocytes undergo endomitosis to generate higher polyploid cells under the stimulation by TPO; however the unique megakaryocytic cells observed in this study have a clue to reveal the cellular evolution of platelets/MKs.
