    "abstract_text": "Here we apply state-of-the-art statistical genetic approaches toward investigating the genetic architecture of factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitor (FEI) development in Hemophilia A (HA). A total of 442 North American HA patients (237 Whites and 205 Blacks; 88% severely affected) enrolled in the PATH Study were: 1) ImmunoChip genotyped at ~167,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes previously implicated in autoimmune disease risk; 2) Evaluated by DNA sequencing and assays for the recurrent intron (I)1 and I22 inversions to identify their causative F8 mutations; and 3) Tested with the Bethesda assay to determine their FEI status. The ImmunoChip genotypes were used to construct a genetic relationship matrix (GRM), denoted by K, following our previously published method, 1 and the F8 sequence data along with results from the I1 and I22 inversion assays were used to construct a shared F8 -mutation matrix, denoted by F. We analyzed a dichotomous FEI variable under the statistical genetic threshold/liability model (a probit regression in the fixed effects) in conjunction with a variance components model for the FEI liability phenotypic covariance matrix, denoted by P, to model potentially important random effects. For the latter, we specifically assumed independent additive genetic, F8 -mutation, and residual environmental random effects. By the independence assumption, the covariance matrix is then decomposable as a sum of the additive genetic (Va), F8 -mutation (Vf), and residual environmental (Ve) variances respectively structured by K, F, and the identity matrix I. The variance component model is given as: P = K*Va + F*Vf + I*Ve. Heritability, denoted by h 2 , is defined as the ratio of Va to the total phenotypic variance (Vp): h 2 = Va / Vp. We can further speak of the total heritability given as: h 2 t = h 2 r + h 2 f + h 2 snp, where the subscripts t, r, f, and snp respectively denote total, residual additive genetic, F8 -mutation-specific, and SNP heritabilities. Using eigenstructure methods, 2 we can compute power under a simpler model in which Va and Vf are combined as a single variance component. We computed power to detect genetic association as measured by SNP-specific heritability for a set of 403 SNPs in or near 14 candidate immune response genes previously implicated in FEI risk. To account for multiple hypothesis testing, power was computed at the Bonferroni-adjusted significance level of 0.05/403 = 1.2 \u00d7 10 -4 . Under the simplified model, we computed the statistical power to detect causal SNPs for our sample and study design for the sample FEI prevalences, denoted by Kp, for Whites (22.5%) and Blacks (45%), across a range of total heritabilities, h 2 t = 15%, 35%, and 55%, where the lattermost total heritability was observed for FEI liability in the current study ( Figure 1 ). It should be noted that because the liability heritability is known to be biased upward, we applied the Dempster-Lerner correction to both the total and SNP-specific heritabilities. 3 Close inspection of Figure 1 reveals that varying h 2 t from 15% to 35% to 55% results in slight decreases in power due to the decreasing ratio of the SNP-specific heritability to the total heritability. However, as seen in all three panels, the more important determinant of power is clearly the FEI prevalence in that the power curve for a Kp of 45% is associated with greater power than the power curve for a Kp of 22.5% across the range of total heritabilities examined. As seen in Figure 1 , we have adequate power to detect SNP heritabilities as low as 5% and 6%, respectively, for a Kp of 45% and 22.5%. As noted above, we observed a FEI liability total heritability of 55% consisting of a 47% residual additive genetic heritability ( p = 0.019) and 8% F8 -mutation specific heritability ( p = 0.005). This is the first study to use a GRM based on genotype data and a shared causal F8 mutation matrix to model additive genetic and F8 -mutation specific effects.
