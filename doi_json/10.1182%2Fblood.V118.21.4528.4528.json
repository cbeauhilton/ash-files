Patient&Method: We retrospectively analyzed 31 multiple myeloma patients (22F;9M) receiving two times high dose therapy supported by auto-HCT in Adult BMT Unit of Ankara University between 2005\u20132010. Median age was 52 years (34\u201366ys) prior to first auto-HCT. We evaluated the response rates of progression free survival (PFS) of both transplantation, respectively and also overall survival (OS) from the diagnosis. Results: The median time from diagnosis to the first transplantation was 11 months (5\u201368ms). The response rates were 87% before the first auto-HSCT [2 Complete response (CR),4 near-CR, 7 very good partial remission (VGPR), 14 PR) but four patients (11%) had refractory disease. The response of first auto-HCT was complete remission or partial response in 50% of the pts and 36% for stable disease. Only 4 pts was progressed at early period of 1 st auto-HCT. The median time from the 1st to 2nd auto-HSCT was 16 months (3\u201364 ms). Seventy-seven percent patients sue to progressive disease responded completely or partially to one or two step treatment regimens before the second auto-HSCT. When evaluated the responses after the second auto-HCT, 14 (46%) patients were in CR or near-CR, 12 (38%) for stabile disease and 5 for refractory. PFS was estimated similar after both first and second auto-HCT (median 9 months vs 10 months, p=0.3) ( Graphic 1 ). Five- year OS from the diagnosis was 75\u00b110%.

Collection of adequate hematopoietic stem cells enough for more than one auto-HCT in myeloma patients can be appropriate. Although the majority of responses after the first AHSCT were partial responses, complete or near complete responses were dominant after the second AHSCT.Improvement in responses and the similarity of progression free survival can be explained by the contribution of the new antimyelom treatment options Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
