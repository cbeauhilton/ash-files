    "abstract_text": "Background: Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP), a potentially fatal hematological emergency, is primarily caused by acquired deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity due to autoantibodies. Immunoglobulin G (IgG)-type autoantibodies bind ADAMTS13 and inhibit its ability to cleave endothelium-derived ultra large von Willebrand factor (ULVWF). However, it remains poorly understood whether plasma VWF status can be used as a disease marker for diagnosis and monitoring therapy in patients with acute iTTP. Objective: To address this question, we determined plasma levels of VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), collagen-binding activity (VWF:CB), active forms of VWF (VWF:Ac), and VWF multimers in iTTP patients during acute episode and in early remission. Patients and Methods : From the Alabama registry, we identified 69 unique patients with a confirmed diagnosis of iTTP in whom plasma ADAMTS13 activity was <10 U/dL with positive inhibitors and elevated anti-ADAMTS13 IgGs. Of 69 patients, 21 had longitudinal plasma samples collected. Plasma samples from 56 healthy individuals, who did not have a hematological disease, cancer, and infection, were recruited as controls. Plasma levels of VWF:Ag, VWF:CB, and VWF:Ac were determined by an ELISA-based assay. Plasma VWF multimer distribution was assessed by an in-gel Western blotting assay following electrophoresis on a 1% SDS-agarose gel. Results : The mean age for our cohort iTTP patients was 43.9 \u00b1 13.4 years. Twenty-six patients were male and 43 were female with male to female ratio of 1 to 1.7. Fifty-three patients were African American descents, 14 Caucasians, 1 Hispanic, and 1 unknown race. Plasma levels of VWF:Ag in acute iTTP patients were 289.4 \u00b1 17.7%, significantly increased compared with those in the healthy controls (144.9 \u00b1 7.6%) ( p <0.0001); plasma levels of VWF:CB in these patients were 241 \u00b1 17.9%, also significantly elevated compared with those in the healthy controls (149.9 \u00b1 12.01%) ( p =0.0001); additionally, plasma levels of VWF:Ac (304.6 \u00b1 23.2%), assessed by its ability to bind anti-VWF-A1 nanobody, were more dramatically elevated compared with those in the controls (101.6 \u00b1 5.9%) ( p <0.0001). More interestingly, while the ratios of VWF:CB to VWF:Ag in patients with acute iTTP (0.8 \u00b1 0.04) were lower than those in the healthy controls (1.0 \u00b1 0.05) ( p =0.0036), the ratios of VWF:Ac to VWF:Ag were significantly higher in patients with acute episode (1.2 \u00b1 0.1) than those in the controls (0.8 \u00b1 0.05) ( p =0.0003). Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in the patient plasma levels of VWF:Ag ( p =0.69) and VWF:CB ( p =0.08) during acute episode and during early remission. However, the plasma levels of VWF:Ac in patients with acute disease were significantly higher than those in the early remission ( p =0.002). Surprisingly, 90% (36/40) of out iTTP patients during acute episode showed the presence of ULVWF in their plasma using in-gel Western blotting, which allows the ULVWF to be detected without the transfer step to avoid any potential loss of larger VWF multimers during protein transfer. These ULVWF multimers disappeared in 3/4 iTTP patients in remission when ADAMTS13 activity recovered. In 28 healthy control samples, only one showed ULVWF. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate, for the first time in a large cohort, that active forms of VWF and ultra large VWF multimers are present in iTTP patient's plasma during the acute period, which is reduced or disappears during the early remission. Therefore, measuring active forms of VWF and ultra large VWF multimers may aid in diagnosis of iTTP and help monitoring of disease processes following therapy. Our ongoing study is to determine whether these biomarkers can be used to predict responses to treatment and long-term outcome. Disclosures Zheng: Alexion: Research Funding, Speakers Bureau.",
