    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Accelerated telomere shortening (TS) in blood cells has been well documented in both dyskeratosis congenita and acquired aplastic anemia (AA). The present study investigated the incidence and long-term outcomes of TS in AA patients treated with ATG plus cyclosporine immunosuppressive therapy (IST). Methods : A total of 53 patients (31 M and 22 F, median age 24, 9-62) with moderate (MAA 15), severe (SAA 22) and very severe (vSAA 16) AA were included in cross-sectional study of telomere length (TEL) between 2008 and 2009 and then followed prospectively for 5 years. Treatment-na\u00efve, recovering after IST and refractory AA were in 13, 35 and 5 patients respectively. There were no cases with physical abnormalities or family history of hematological disorders. TEL in granulocytes was assessed by Flow-FISH method with calculation of absolute and age-adjusted (DeltaTEL) values. TS was defined as absolute TEL value below the normal 99% confidence interval in age matched healthy donors (n=71). Outcome measures were response rate in treatment-na\u00efve patients, cumulative incidence (CI) of relapse and clonal evolution, overall (OS) and failure-free survival (FFS). Adult patients or parents of children signed informed consent. Results: TS was detected in 24 patients (45%) with a median DeltaTEL of -1.715 kbp compared to -0.009 kbp in 29 patients with normal telomere length (TN) (Table 1). Table 1.

No significant differences in gender, median age, baseline blood counts, PNH positivity or interval from AA onset and IST were observed between the two groups. Median follow-up after IST start and TEL testing were 90 and 67 months respectively. Response rates to IST were similar in TS (3/4, 75%) and TN (6/9, 67%) patients evaluated prospectively (p=1.0). TS and TN patients showed similar 10-year CI of relapse (16% vs 14%, p=0.905) and hemolytic PNH (28% vs 20%, p=0.532). However, all 3 cases of MDS /AML occurred in patients with TS with CI of 15.4% vs. 0% in the TN (p = 0.063). Compared patient groups have similar high probability of 10-year OS (TS 86.9% vs TN 92.6%, p=0.571) due to the large proportion of patients responding to treatment. The FFS rates were much lower (38.5% and 57.5% respectively, p=0.510). Conclusions: TS is a relatively common phenomenon in patients with otherwise typical acquired AA and more frequently detected in MAA and refractory to IST cases in cross-sectional study. Our data confirm the previously reported association of TS and increased risk of MDS/AML, which should be considered for a more careful monitoring and treatment planning, including allogeneic BMT as a curative approach.
