    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4900 Introduction: Clinical studies have shown that Rituximab plus Bendamustin (R-B) in indolent lymphoma results in favourable responses, progression free survival (PFS) and lower toxicity as compared to R-CHOP. The aim of this analysis was to characterize response and tolerability of R-B in patients with LBCL, who were not qualifying for R-CHOP due to age, comorbidity and/or prior pretreatment (including anthracyclines). Methods: We retrospectively identified consecutive patients with LBCL receiving at least two cycles of R-B in our department between 2003 and 2010 using our electronic tumor documentation system. Patient characteristics, response to R-B, and toxicity were assessed. Results: We identified 9 caucasian patients (5 females, 4 males) with LBCL; their median age was 71 years (range; 51\u201382). Two presented with stage I/II, seven with stage III/IV disease at initial diagnosis and before R-B. Six patients had a low or intermediate IPI and three were high risk. Four patients received R-B as first-line therapy, and five were treated for relapsed or refractory disease. Main determinants for the R-B-selection were contraindications for anthracyclines in five patients and advanced age and/or poor performance status in four patients. A median of four R-B-cycles were applied (range; 2\u20136). Response with achievement of CR and PR was observed in 6/9 (CR: 2, PR: 4), two achieved SD. Only one pt showed PD after four R-B cycles. The response of R-B in first-line vs. relapsed appeared similar. Of note, one female patient with secondary LCBL, after initial Hodgkin's lymphoma and C-MOPP chemotherapy (CTx) and mediastinal irradiation - with excellent response to R-B- failed to successfully mobilize PBSC thereafter. However, she was effectively mobilized with R-Ara-C-thiotepa (peripheral blood CD34+ cells were 5.82 vs. 54/\u03bcl, obtaining no vs. 6.72 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg KG via leukapheresis, respectively). Clinical tolerance of R-B in all patients was excellent in a total of 31 R-B-cycles, only two major CTC-events occurred: one infection (CTC grade III) and one thromboembolism (grade IV). Median PFS and overall Survival (OS) were 16 (7- not reached) and 20 (11-21) months. Conclusions: If standard R-CHOP cannot be given due to age, comorbidity or CTx-contraindications (e.g. anthracyclines), R-B may represent an effective treatment in LBCL. Larger cohorts and prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm these promising results. Currently, patients with grade III/IV follicular lymphoma are additionally evaluated for response and tolerability under R-B, also being presented at the meeting.
