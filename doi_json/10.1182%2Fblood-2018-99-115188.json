    "abstract_text": "Background: With recent FDA approvals of CAR T cell therapy for the treatment of relapsed/refractory aggressive B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, an increasing number of older adults will be treated with this therapy. An improved understanding of the safety of CAR T cell therapy in this population is important to inform clinical decision making for the treatment of older subjects. Methods: Data from two prospective single arm studies (n=214) of two approved CART cell products for the treatment of relapsed/refractory lymphoma were pooled and analyzed. Rates of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), as well as severity and treatment modalities (oxygen, vasopressor support, tocilizumab and steroids) were pooled and analyzed by age. Selected neuropsychiatric events were pooled and analyzed by age. Results: Age was balanced between the two studies. The median age of subjects was 58 years (range 22-76 years). Of the 214 total subjects, 24% were 65 years of age and older. CRS and neurotoxicity were evaluated in the subjects who received treatment with CAR T cell therapy. (Table 1). *Two studies employed different grading methods for CRS; Lee's criteria (Lee DW et al, Blood 2014) and U Penn criteria (Porter DL et al, Blood 2014) Conclusions: This exploratory analysis suggests overall similar rates of CRS and grade 2 and higher CRS in subjects less than 65 years as compared to 65 years of age and older. There appears to be an overall higher rate of encephalopathy and grade 3 and higher delirium/encephalopathy in adults 65 years and older compared to less than 65 years of age. The inclusion of greater numbers of patients \u2265 65 years of age in clinical trials will further inform clinicians about the safety and efficacy of CAR T cell therapy in older adults.
