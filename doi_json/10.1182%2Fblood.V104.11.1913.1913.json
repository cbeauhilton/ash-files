    "abstract_text": "Background: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) has a variable clinical course, of which IgVH mutational status of the malignant B cells is a strong independent predictor for outcome. Objective: We studied the expression of 5 different genes for their value to predict IgVH mutational status and overall survival (OS). Methods: mRNA levels were quantified by real time PCR in lymphoprep separated but unsorted blood samples from 110 morphologically and fenotypically characterised CLL patients for the following genes: ZAP70, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), ADAM29, KIAA0610 and nRIP1. Expression levels were compared wih respect to IgVH mutational status (mutation = % germline < 98%), using logistic regression and with respect to OS (= time from day of laboratory tests to death due to any cause), using Cox regression analysis. Results: The predictive value of the expression of these 5 genes for IgVH mutational status is shown in table 1. Each of these genes showed to be an independent marker for the prediction of IgVH mutational status. LPL as a single marker was the best predictor for mutation. These factors taken together had a high predictive value towards mutational IgVH status (area under ROC curve = 0.93). table 1  . . N . Odds ratio . P value .

From the six parameters tested, IgVH mutational status and LPL were predictors for OS at a significant level of 5%, while ZAP70 was of borderline significance. table 2 Conclusion: measured in unsorted CLL samples, all genes, and especially LPL, had predictive value towards the presence of IgVH mutation. Expression of LPL and absence of mutation were adverse prognostic factors for survival. Thus, the replacement of the assessment of both IgVH mutational status and ZAP70 by assessment of LPL levels for the prediction of prognosis in CLL patients may be considered.  . .
