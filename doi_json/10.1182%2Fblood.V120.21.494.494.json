    "abstract_text": "Abstract 494 Background: Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), the primary physiologic inhibitor of the tissue factor (TF)/factor VIIa (FVIIa) enzymatic complex, is found in plasma, on endothelial cells, and within platelets. There are two alternatively-spliced isoforms of TFPI, TFPI\u03b1 and TFPI\u03b2. TFPI\u03b1 is secreted from endothelial cells, present in plasma and stored in circulating platelets, while TFPI\u03b2 is the primary cell surface-expressed isoform of TFPI. TFPI\u03b1 is composed of three Kunitz-type inhibitor domains: K1 and K2 bind to and inhibit the serine proteases FVIIa and factor Xa (FXa), respectively, and K3 binds to protein S (PS). TFPI\u03b2 contains the same K1 and K2 domains and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored C-terminus. PS serves as a cofactor for plasma TFPI\u03b1 in the inhibition of factor Xa (FXa), as measured by amidolytic activity assays. However, TFPI\u03b1 is a poor inhibitor of thrombin generation by the prothrombinase complex (FXa and its cofactor, factor Va (FVa)) regardless of whether PS is present. Thus, the physiologic function of FXa inhibition by the TFPI/PS anticoagulant system is not entirely clear, particularly on the platelet surface where prothrombinase assembly occurs. In addition, it is not known if PS cofactor activity is mediated by localizing TFPI to the membrane surface, thereby enhancing its interaction with membrane-bound FXa, or by directly enhancing the interaction between TFPI and FXa once both are on the membrane surface. Methods/Results: The cofactor activity of PS toward recombinant TFPI\u03b1 (rTFPI\u03b1), platelet TFPI\u03b1, and cell surface-associated forms of TFPI was measured. As previously published, low concentrations of PS (5 nM) enhanced the inhibitory activity of rTFPI\u03b1 in a FXa amidolytic activity assay. PS also substantially delayed thrombin generation in assays where rTFPI\u03b1, FXa, and PS were incubated prior to addition of FVa, but not when FVa was first incubated with FXa (before rTFPI\u03b1 and PS addition). PS was also found to enhance the inhibition of FXa by platelet TFPI\u03b1 (measured in platelet lysates), in a dose-dependent manner, with enhancement apparent at concentrations as low as 5 nM. Unlike with experiments performed using recombinant or platelet TFPI\u03b1, PS (at concentrations up to 80 nM) had no impact on the inhibition of either FXa amidolytic activity or thrombin generation when assays were performed using CHO cells expressing TFPI\u03b2 or a GPI-anchored TFPI\u03b1 (K1K2K3-GPI). Additionally, PS did not act as a cofactor for endogenous TFPI on the surface of EA.hy926 cells or primary HUVECs. However, TFPI\u03b1 released from EA.hy926 cells by treatment with heparin was enhanced by addition of PS, to a similar extent as observed with rTFPI\u03b1. TFPI\u03b2, released by treatment with phosphoinositol-specific phospholipase C, displayed little inhibitory activity either in the presence or absence of PS. Conclusions: (1) PS is a cofactor for the inhibition of FXa by soluble TFPI\u03b1, including platelet TFPI\u03b1, but not for surface-associated forms of TFPI, regardless of the presence of the K3 domain. (2) PS functions by localizing and retaining TFPI\u03b1 at the membrane surface, rather than through a direct enhancement of the interaction between TFPI\u03b1 and FXa. (3) PS stabilizes the TFPI\u03b1/FXa inhibitory complex. In this manner, PS may act physiologically to sequester FXa away from FVa and slow assembly of prothrombinase on the surface of activated platelets.
