    "abstract_text": "Methionine synthase (MS) is a key enzyme involved in remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. We tested the hypothesis that deficiency of MS influences endothelial function. Mice heterozygous for disruption of the Ms gene ( Ms +/\u2212), and wild type littermates ( Ms +/+), were fed either a control diet or a low folate (LF) diet. Plasma total homocysteine was similar in Ms +/+ and Ms +/\u2212 mice fed the control diet (4.5\u00b10.3 and 5.3\u00b10.4 \u03bcmol/L, respectively), and was mildly elevated in Ms +/+ or Ms +/\u2212 mice fed the LF diet (7.5\u00b10.7 and 9.6\u00b11.2 \u03bcmol/L, respectively; p<0.001 vs. control diet). Dilatation of cerebral arterioles (~30 \u03bcm diameter) to the endothelium-dependent dilator, acetylcholine (10 \u03bcM), was blunted in Ms+/ \u2212 mice compared with Ms+/+ mice fed the control diet (21\u00b14 vs. 32\u00b14%; p<0.05). Both Ms+/+ and Ms+/ \u2212 mice exhibited impaired dilatation of cerebral arterioles to acetylcholine when they were fed the LF diet (12\u00b12 and 17\u00b13%, respectively; p<0.01 vs. Ms +/+ mice fed the control diet). Dilatation of cerebral arterioles in response to the endothelium-independent dilator, nitroprusside, was similar in all groups of mice. Relaxation of aortic rings to acetylcholine was not influenced by Ms genotype or diet. Elevated levels of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide were detected by dihydroethidium (DHE) and dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF), respectively, in cerebral arterioles of Ms +/\u2212 mice fed the control diet and in both Ms +/+ and Ms +/\u2212 mice fed the LF diet. These findings demonstrate that defective homocysteine remethylation caused by deficiency of either MS or folate produces endothelial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress in the cerebral microcirculation of mice. Interestingly, impairment of cerebral vascular function was independent of plasma tHcy concentration."
