Recent advances in cytogenetic, molecular and genomic studies have led to identification of several chromosomal and molecular abnormalities. These abnormalities are important predictors of response to therapy, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). On conventional cytogenetic (CC) analyses, del 13, t(4;14), t(14;16) and del 17p are considered high-risk (HR). On Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, all except del 13 are considered HR (Munshi, N et al. Blood 2011 117: 4696\u20134700 ). However there are a number of chromosomal abnormalities whose significance is not clearly identified (non-HR). In this study we report the impact of these non-HR chromosomal abnormalities on the outcome of patients who received high-dose chemotherapy and auto-HCT. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients with multiple myeloma who underwent high dose chemotherapy followed by auto-HCT at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Between 10/1991 and 12/2010, 1570 patients received auto-HCT. The results of CC studies were available for 1329 patients, either at diagnosis or at relapse, but before auto-HCT. The primary objective was to study the impact of non-HR chromosomal abnormalities on PFS and OS, and to compare them to patients without chromosomal abnormalities. Results: Patient characteristics and major outcomes are summarized in the attached Table. In 1329 patients with available CC analyses before auto-HCT, chromosomal abnormalities were identified in 405 (30%) patients. One-hundred and seven (7%) patients had known HR chromosomal abnormalities, while 298 (23%) patients had non-HR chromosomal abnormalities. Fifty (17%) patients with non-HR chromosomal abnormalities and 296 patients (32%) with normal CC achieved complete or stringent complete responses (CR + sCR) (p=0.0001). Median follow up in surviving patients was 36 months. Median PFS in patients with non-HR chromosomal abnormalities and normal CC were 18.2 months (95%CI: 16\u201322.7) and 32.7 months (95% CI: 27.8\u201336.3), respectively (p= <.0001) ( Figure 1 ). The OS in patients with non-HR chromosomal abnormalities and with normal CC were 56.5 months (95% CI: 43.2\u201366.9) and 87.2 months (95%CI: 80.1\u2013102.4), respectively (p= <.0001) ( Figure 2 ).

Further studies are needed to better define these non-HR abnormalities and their impact on prognosis. TABLE 1 . Normal (n= 924) . Non-High Risk (n= 298) .
