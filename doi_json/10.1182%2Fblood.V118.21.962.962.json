    "abstract_text": "Abstract 962 Specialized bone marrow (BM) microenvironmental niches are essential for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) lodgment and maintenance. However microenvironmental interactions of leukemia stem cells (LSC) are poorly understood. Although chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) results from HSC transformation by the BCR-ABL gene, the role of the microenvironment in modulating leukemia development is not known. We employed the SCL-tTA-BCR/ABL mouse model of CML to investigate the LSC interactions with the BM microenvironment. In this model, targeted expression of the BCR-ABL gene in murine HSC via a tet-regulated SCL promoter results in development of a chronic phase CML-like disorder. We have reported that LSC capacity is restricted to BCR-ABL+ cells with long-term hematopoietic stem cell (LTHSC) phenotype(LSK Flt3-CD150+CD48-) (Blood 2010 116:1212A). LSC numbers are reduced in the BM but increased in the spleen of CML mice compared with LTHSC from control mice, suggesting that LSC have altered niche interactions. LSC also demonstrate altered trafficking with significant reduction in homing of IV injected LSC to BM, and markedly increased egress of intrafemorally injected LSC to the spleen, potentially related to reduced CXCL12 levels in the BM of CML mice. In addition, levels of several chemokines and cytokines, including MIP1\u03b1, MIP1\u03b2, MIP2, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, G-CSF and IL-6, were increased in CML BM, related to increased production by malignant hematopoietic cells. We investigated whether altered chemokine and cytokine expression was associated with altered capacity of the CML BM microenvironment to support LTHSC engraftment. LTHSC from control mice or LSC from CML mice were transplanted into irradiated CML or control recipients. There was reduced engraftment of both control LTHSC and CML LSC in the BM of CML compared to control recipients at 2 weeks after transplantation, associated with reduced homing to CML BM, potentially related to low BM CXCL12 levels. The numbers of control LTHSC in the BM of CML recipient mice remained low at 4 weeks post-transplantation, whereas the numbers of CML LSC increased to numbers similar to those seen in the BM of control recipients. Culture with CML BM supernatants (SN) resulted in impaired growth of control LTHSC compared to control BM SN. In contrast the growth of CML LSC was similar following culture with CML and control BM SN. Culture with individual factors at concentrations similar to those observed in CML BM (16ng/ml MIP1\u03b1, 8ng/ml MIP1\u03b2, 2.5ng/ml IL-1\u03b1, 3.5ng/ml IL-1\u03b2, 0.05ng/ml TNF-\u03b1) resulted in significantly reduced growth of normal LTHSC compared with CML LSC. These results indicate that diffusible factors produced by leukemic cells in the CML BM environment selectively inhibit normal LTHSC compared to CML LSC growth. Exposure of a murine stromal cell line to CML BM SN resulted in reduced CXCL12 mRNA levels compared to BM SN from control mice. The cytokine G-CSF, which was increased in CML BM SN, has been reported to reduce CXCL12 transcription. We observed significant reduction of CXCL12 mRNA levels in stromal cells cultured with G-CSF (0.2ng/ml), supporting a potential role for increased G-CSF production by leukemia cells in reduced CXCL12 production by CML BM stromal cells and reduced LSC retention in the BM. We evaluated whether defects in microenvironmental function in CML were affected by imatinib treatment. Treatment of CML mice with imatinib (200mg/kg/day, 2 weeks) led to reduction in MIP1\u03b1, MIP1\u03b2, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 levels in BM cells. Engraftment of normal LTHSC was significantly enhanced in BM of CML recipients pre-treated with imatinib. Results obtained with the mouse model were validated using specimens obtained from CML patients. CXCL12 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in human CML compared to normal MNCs, whereas expression of MIP1\u03b1, MIP-2, IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were increased in CML MNCs, consistent with results obtained with the mouse model. Coculture with CML MNC conditioned medium (CM) resulted in selective impairment of growth of normal CD34+CD38- primitive progenitors compared to CM from normal MNC, but did not inhibit growth of CML progenitors. We conclude that leukemia-induced alterations in BM cytokine and chemokine levels contribute to altered LSC lodgment and to selective impairment of growth of normal LTHSC in the CML BM microenvironment, leading to a relative growth advantage for CML LSC over normal LTHSC and expansion of the leukemic clone.
