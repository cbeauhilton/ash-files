    "abstract_text": "Quantum dots (QDs) are fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals (2\u201310-nm core diameter) possessing the unique properties of extremely high fluorescence efficiency, lack of photobleaching and long fluorescence lifetime, making them an ideal tool for bioimaging. We have developed a novel technique for in situ hybridisation (ISH) using biotinylated oligonucleotides conjugated to streptavidin coated QD, and used them in this study to label bone marrow trephine samples. 50-mer long oligonucleotide probes were conjugated to QDs prior to ISH and conjugation efficiency was demonstrated by gel electrophopresis. ISH conditions and molar ratio of QDs to probe were optimised using a polyT probe. Images were captured using a CRI Nuance spectral imaging system and signal intensity was semi-quantitated using IPLab software. Specific oligonucleotide hybridisation was demonstrated using a probe for myeloperoxidase (MPO) in 40 bone marrow sections infiltrated by acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) as well as reactive bone marrow. In each case hybridisation signal was consistent with the distribution of MPO by standard immunohistochemistry - MPO was strongly expressed by myeloid blasts and absent in lymphoid blasts; in CML, most, but not all, cells were positive for MPO, in comparison to many fewer positive cells in reactive marrow. Duplex ISH was demonstrated using a probe for bcl-2 together with MPO in 5 bone marrow sections infiltrated by follicular lymphoma (FL). Strong hybridisation signal for bcl-2 was detected in all cells of the paratrabecular aggregates of FL but showed only scattered positivity in the remainder of the bone marrow. Conversely, MPO was absent in the paratrabecular aggregates and present in the myeloid cells in the remainder of the marrow. This pattern was present in both single and duplex ISH for MPO and bcl-2 in the marrow infiltrated by FL. Duplex ISH was performed both by sequential hybridisation with bcl-2 followed by MPO, and simultaneously with a mix of bcl-2 and MPO probes. As negative controls, scrambled oligonucleotide probes for the corresponding genes were used in each case and did not show hybridisation. In summary, we have developed a generic method for QD labelling and semi-quantitative detection of oligonucleotide ISH in routinely processed clinical tissue samples. Although, in this study we primarily used bone marrow trephine samples, this technique can be applied to any tissue. It has the potential to facilitate transfer of microarray-identified gene signatures to clinical research and diagnostics, whilst the ability of spectral imaging to resolve multiple signals offers the possibility of multiplexed probe detection.",
