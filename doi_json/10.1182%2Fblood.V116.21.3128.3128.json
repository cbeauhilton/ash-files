    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3128 Background: follicular lymphoma is an incurable, long-lasting disease with an heterogeneous outcome. Several prognostic systems have been proposed, and recently a new one, the FLIPI2 score based on five parameters has been published. However, in order to confirm its prognostic utility, further studies at other centers are highly recommendable. Aim: to validate the new FLIPI2 score in independent series of follicular lymphoma patients diagnosed at our institution between February 1990 and July 2010. Patients and methods. We considered 180 patients consecutively diagnosed with follicular diagnosis in the period described and from whom all variables required were available. The variables included were: beta2microglobulin higher than the upper normal value, longest diameter of the largest involved node longer than 6 cm, bone marrow infiltration, hemoglobin level lower than 120 g/L and age older than 60 years (one point if present). Three risk groups were identified: low risk (0 points), intermediate risk (1 -2) and high risk (3 or more) Progression-free survival was measured from date of treatment until date of progression or death from any cause. Continuous variables were summarized as median and range, categorical variables reported as counts, and PFS and OS carried out using the Kaplan-Meier method and curves compared by the log-rank test. Results: median age was 55 years (range, 24 to 77), male sex 92 (51%), Ann Arbor Stage I-II: 32(18%), III-IV: 143 (82%), age > 60 y 70 (39%), Hb < 120 g/L 38 (21%), \u03b2 2 microglobulin > UNV: 45 (25%), LDH > UNV: 34 (19%), bone marrow infiltration 82 (48%), longer diameter of the largest involved node > 6 cm 64 (36%). 47 patients (26%) received rituximab-containing regimens and 124 received conventional chemotherapy regimens (pre-rituximab era). Median follow-up of the series was 66.9 months (range,1.3-221). Using the FLIPI score (n=162) 58 patients (36%) were in the low risk group, 54 (33%) were in the intermediate group and 50 (31%) in the high risk group. Using the FLIPI2 (n=180) 36 patients (20%) were in the low risk group, 103 (57%) in the intermediate group and 41 (23%) in the high risk group. According to FLIPI 5y- PFS rate was 79% for the low risk group, 63% for the intermediate group and 32% for the high risk group, p < 0.001. According to FLIPI2 score, 5y-PFS rate was 82% for the low risk, 54% for the intermediate and 43% for the high risk groups, p=0.017. Concerning OS, applying the FLIPI, 5y-OS rate for the low, intermediate and high risk groups were 94%m 84% and 64%, respectively, p=0.003. Using the FLIPI2, 5y-OS for the low, intermediate and high risk groups were 96%, 80% and 67% respectively, p=0.006. Conclusions: in our experience the FLIPI2 score is a reproducible prognostic index in patients with follicular lymphoma although the FLIPI score seems to discriminate better between groups than the FLIPI2 score.
