    "abstract_text": "Background : Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a non-Langerhans cell histiocytic disorder that almost exclusively affects adults. Reports of pediatric-onset ECD are only anecdotal. Additionally, a comprehensive clinical and molecular characterization of pediatric ECD is lacking. Methods : All prevalent and incident cases followed at three ECD referral centers in Italy and France were considered eligible when they had: a) an age <18y at disease onset; b) a clinical presentation consistent with ECD ( i.e. , at least one of the following localizations: bilateral, sclerotic bone involvement; sclerotic bone lesions of facial sinuses; hairy kidneys; coated aorta; xanthelasma; tumoral atrial involvement); c) pathology consistent with ECD or mixed ECD-Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH); d) available data on molecular studies. Results : Ten patients were included (4 boys and 6 girls); their median age at diagnosis was 4.5 years (IQR 3-9). Bone pain, diabetes insipidus, and exophthalmos were the predominant clinical manifestations at onset. The most commonly involved sites were the hypothalamic/pituitary axis (8/10, 80%), the maxillary/facial structures (8/10, 80%), the bone (6/10, 60%), and the central nervous system (CNS; 7/10, 70%). Other less frequent localizations included the skin (3/10, 30%), the retroperitoneum (2/10, 20%), the lymph nodes (2/10, 20%), the large vessels (1/10, 10%), the heart (1/10, 10%), and the lung (1/10, 10%). The median number of involved sites was four (IQR 4-4). Four patients (of whom three were younger than nine years) had clinical or pathological features consistent with mixed histiocytosis (ECD-LCH). Molecular analysis of tissue biopsies revealed the BRAF V600E mutation in 6 patients (60%). As compared with adult series, the retroperitoneum, the heart, the lungs, and the skin seemed to be less frequently involved. Conversely, hypothalamic/pituitary and maxillary/facial involvement were apparently more frequent in our pediatric cohort. Treatments were heterogeneous. First-line regimens mainly consisted of chemotherapy deriving from LCH-based regimens: six out of the eight treated patients received chemotherapy, but only two of them achieved a transient response. Interferon-alpha was used in five patients (as first-line treatment in two and as a rescue treatment in three), with a partial response in two. Four patients with the BRAF V600E mutation received the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib at some point (partial responses were obtained in all, in one case requiring a combination with cobimetinib). All patients were alive at last follow up (median 94 months, IQR 12-108). Chronic sequelae included end-stage kidney disease in one patient, growth retardation in two, and endocrine abnormalities in seven. Conclusions : The clinical phenotype of ECD differs between children and adults. The hypothalamic/pituitary axis and the maxillary/facial area are frequently involved in pediatric cases, whereas other localizations typically seen in adults ( i.e., retroperitoneum, heart, lung, and skin) are rarer. An overlap with LCH is frequent, especially in younger patients. As for LCH, targeted treatments can be highly effective in children carrying the BRAF V600E mutation.
