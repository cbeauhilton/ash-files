    "abstract_text": "Many studies have shown Fas- Fas Ligand (FasL) mediated apoptosis to be important in maturation and differentiation of erythroid precursors in vitro. To determine if there is a similar process regulating erythropoietic homeostasis in vivo, we studied erythropoiesis in Fas( lpr ) and FasL ( gld ) deficient mice. We postulated that deficiency of Fas or FasL should result in changes in red blood cell (RBC) parameters and/or decreased levels of apoptosis of erythroblasts. To test this hypothesis under steady state conditions, blood and bone marrow were collected from 10-week old C57Bl/6 control mice, B6.MRL- Tnfrsf6 lpr /J CD95 deficient mice, and B6Smn.C3- Tnfsf6 gld /J CD95L deficient mice. Hematology was studied using a Bayer Advia 120 and femoral bone marrow was analyzed by 6-color flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson FACSAria. Hematologic analysis revealed no differences in reticulocyte counts, RBC counts or hemoglobin (Hgb) in either lpr or gld mice compared to C57Bl/6 controls. Similarly, analysis of bone marrow revealed no differences in % of Ter-119 bright CD71 bright basophilic erythroblast (BEB), % apoptotic BEB (annexin V+, 7-AAD dim ) or % FasL+ BEB in either gld or lpr mice compared to control. As expected, lpr mice expressed 10 fold fewer Fas+ BEB while similar levels were observed in gld mice compared to controls. To test our hypothesis under stimulated conditions, control, lpr and gld mice received a single s.c. dose of 10,000 units of recombinat human erythropoietin (rhEPO). Bone marrow samples were collected 48 hours after dosing and blood samples 4, 8 and 16 days after dosing. Hematologic analysis revealed no differences in the erythropoietic response among the three strains of mice tested. Moreover, treatment with rhEPO had no effect on % Fas+ BEB in any strain, but induced a 2\u20135 fold increase in the % FasL+ BEB and a 2\u20133 fold increase in apoptotic BEB in all three strains. Based on our observations, we conclude Fas/FasL is unlikely to play a pivotal role in regulating erythroid homeostasis.",
