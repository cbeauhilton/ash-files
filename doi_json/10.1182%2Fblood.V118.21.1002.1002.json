    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1002 Background: Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neuropeptide hormone and type 2 cytokine that inhibits Th1 immunity and induces the generation of regulatory T-cells. We have recently reported that non-transplanted mice \u201cknocked-out\u201d for VIP and syngeneic transplant recipients of VIP-knockout (KO) BM had dramatically improved survival, viral clearance, and increased numbers of specific antiviral CD8 + T-cells following murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV) infection (JI 2011. 187:1057\u201365). In this study, we used a small molecule VIP antagonist as well as VIP-KO mice to further investigate effects and mechanisms of VIP-signaling on antiviral immune responses in wild type (WT) non-transplanted mice and following allogeneic BMT. Methods: B10BR (CD45.2, H-2K k ) and CB6/J F1 (CD45.2, H-2K b/d ) mice were transplanted with 3 \u00d7 10 3 FACS-sorted hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), 5 \u00d7 10 4 dendritic cells (DC), and 0.3, 1, or 3 \u00d7 10 6 splenic T-cells either from VIP-KO (CD45.2, H-2K b ) or WT donors after myeloablative conditioning (11Gy). WT mice and BMT recipients transplanted with WT grafts were treated with daily subcutaneous injection of VIP antagonist (10 \u03bcg/100\u03bcL per mouse) or PBS for 7 days (from one day prior to infection to 6 days post-infection). BALB/C mice, B6 VIP-KO and WT littermates, as well as CB6/J F1 BMT recipients, were infected with graded doses (LD10, LD50 and LD90) of mCMV by intraperitoneal injection. Survival, viral load, antigen specific T-cells, and clinical scores of graft versus host disease (GvHD) were assessed at distinct time-points post-BMT or after mCMV infection. The expression of co-stimulatory or co-inhibitory markers (CD25, CD62L, CD69, PD-1, FoxP3, PD-L1, CD80, CD86, and MHC-II) and intracellular expression of cytokines (IL-10, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-12) on T-cells and DC from the mice were measured by flow cytometry. Results: Improved survival was seen in mCMV-infected allogeneic B6\u2192CB6/J F1 transplant recipients of VIP-KO grafts (100%) compared with recipients of WT grafts treated with PBS (40%). Allogeneic recipients of VIP-KO grafts and allogeneic recipients of WT grafts treated with VIP antagonist had increased viral clearance and enhanced in vivo killing of viral-peptide-pulsed targets compared with PBS-treated recipients of WT grafts. No difference in the incidence or severity of acute GvHD was seen in allogeneic BMT recipients of graded doses of VIP-KO versus WT splenic T-cells (0.3, 1, and 3 \u00d7 10 6 ) in murine MHC mis-matched BMT models. Allogeneic transplant recipients of VIP-KO grafts and WT grafts treated with VIP antagonist, infected with low dose mCMV, had lower levels of PD-L1 and PD-1 expression on DC and T-cells, respectively, and higher levels of CD80, CD86 and MHC-II expression on conventional DC (cDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) compared with recipients of WT allografts treated with PBS. Recipients of VIP-KO grafts and recipients treated with VIP antagonist had higher-levels of IL-12 + cDC, activated CD25 + /CD69 + CD4 and CD8 T-cells, and more mCMV-M45-peptide MHC-I tetramer + CD8 + T-cells compared with recipients of WT grafts treated with PBS. Absence of VIP-signaling led to enhanced intracellular expression of IFN-\u03b3 and less IL-10 expression in T-cells from mCMV-infected recipients of VIP-KO B6\u2192CB6/J F1 allogeneic transplants, and mCMV-infected, VIP antagonist-treated recipients of WT allogeneic transplants. In the absence of mCMV infection, the numbers of regulatory T cells (Treg) were similar among VIP-KO mice, WT mice treated with VIP antagonist, and PBS-treated WT controls. In contrast, mCMV-infected VIP-KO mice had significantly fewer Treg compared with mCMV- infected WT mice, non-infected WT mice and non-infected VIP-KO mice. Conclusion: Genetic or pharmacological blockade of VIP-signaling enhanced both innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses in allogeneic BMT recipients without significantly elevating GvHD. Selective targeting of VIP-signaling represents a novel therapeutic approach to enhance antiviral immunity in the setting of immunodeficiency and allogeneic BMT.
