    "abstract_text": "Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a disease of monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow which has a transient response to classic chemotherapy. At diagnosis, induction chemotherapy followed by high-dose melphalan (HDM) with stem cell support is used in most patients to achieve a clinical response. Because all patients will ultimately relapse, the treatment of melphalan-refractory disease represents a major clinical challenge and new agents are needed to overcome melphalan resistance. We have investigated the anti-myeloma efficacy of two new classes of targeted agents, i.e. proteasome inhibition and histone deacetylation inhibition alone or in combination in the melphalan sensitive MM1S and the Melphalan refractory MM1MEL2000 cell lines. The IC50 values of Bortezomib (B), Melphalan (M) and LAQ824 (L) in MM1S were 2.1 nM, 1.9 uM and 1.7 nM, respectively and in MM1MEL2000 3.9 nM, 50 uM and 4.0 nM. Using isobologram analysis a synergysm between B and L was observed in the sensitive, however not in the melphalan refractory cell line. These data indicate that B proteasome inhibition and histone deacetylation inhibition may be effective ways to overcome melphalan resistance. However, the previously reported synergism between these drugs does not seem to occur in melphalan resistant cells. The gene expression profiles of these cell lines were analysed using the Affymetrix U133plus 2.0 gene chip before and after treatment with melfaphalan or the proteasome inhibitor B or the histone deacetylation inhibitor L or the combination of B and L. Genes that were highly expressed in the melphalan refractory derivate cell line MM1MEL2000 as compared with wild-type MM1S included GP M6B, ADAM23 and HTPAP. Following melphalan exposure, TMF1, a CEBp glucocorticoid interaction factor, WHSC1L1, a MMSET homologue with EGF like domain and several transcription factors had highly increased expression as compared to MM1S. With exposure to B combined with L, increased expression in MM1MEL2000 over MM1S was observed for GTP exchange factor TIAM1 which interacts with RAS and JNK, and the lymphoid enhancer factor, a notch transcription factor. It is concluded that Bortezomib and the histone deacetylase inhibitor LAQ824 are effective agents to overcome melphalan resistance in multiple myeloma. However, the combination fails to show the synergism observed in melphalan sensitive cells. Gene analysis sofar does not provide a clear explanation for this lack of synergism. A comprehensive summary of the observed shifts of gene expression profiles in melphalan resistant cells following exposure to these agents, will be presented.",
