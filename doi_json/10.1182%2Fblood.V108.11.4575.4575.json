    "abstract_text": "Optimal management of patients with acute myeloid leukemia requires an accurate diagnosis along with cytogenetics and an intensive systemic chemotherapy regimen administered by a multidisciplinary team of experienced physicians, nurses and other support staff. It has been suggested that such complex patients should be treated only at tertiary care centers. However, it is often difficult for patients and families to receive care at teratiary care center which may be at a great distance from their home. Here we present a retrospective review of all patients diagnosed and treated for acute myeloid leukemia at William W Backus Hospital, a 213 bed acute care hospital serving a community of 70,000 in Norwich, Connecticut between the years 2000 and 2005. A total of 44 patients were treated during this period. There were 22 males and 22 females. The median age was 67.5 years. Bone Marrow samples were evaluated by a hematopathologist (histopathology, flowcytometry and cytogenetics) at a near-by tertiary care center. FAB subgroups and cytogenetics were similar to other published studies. APML patients are not included in this analysis. The median survival for the entire group was 14.7 months ranging from 2 days to 113 months. Fourteen patients were alive, all in continued clinical remission except one with relapsed disease and one patient remains transfusion dependent. Median survival was 15.2 months for men compared to 13.2 months for women. Four patients were referred for bone marrow/stem cell transplant after induction therapy. The limitation of this study is the relatively small number of patients as one would expect from a study done at a small community hospital. Nevertheless, it appears that the median survival of our patients is similar to a pooled analysis of five SWOG trials published by Gundacker et al. We conclude that most patients with acute myeloid leukemia can be managed in a community hospital with commitment and experience to treat such patients. Treatment outcomes (median survival)  Study .
