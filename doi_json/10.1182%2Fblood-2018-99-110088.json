    "abstract_text": "Background : Palliative care is becoming more and more important for systemic cancer treatment in developed countries, while this remains infamous topic in developing countries, such as in China. Contemporary treatment strategies have greatly contributed to the improved outcome in childhood cancer patients, survivorship comes at the cost of developing some treatment-related health condition, such as pain-related depression, chronic pain etc. Thus, developing a well-tolerated pain control methods is of great importance within the cancer treatment. Objective : To evaluate the impact and outcome of different pain control applications on invasive procedure in children with leukemia, and record the adverse reactions. Methods : The enrollment of childhood leukemia patients in our hospital from November 2011 to November 2016 were divided into four groups, that is successively midazolam + local anesthesia (group A), midazolam + ketamine +local anesthesia (group B), midazolam + fentanyl + local anesthesia (group C), and fentanyl + propofol + local anesthesia (group D). The efficacy and adverse reactions were systemically recorded. The inter-group diffferences were calculated using x 2 test. Results : No significancewas observed in age, gender, and disease distribution in these four groups by ANOVA ONEWAY analysis. The sedation outcome is more pronunced in group D than others. Also, the quality of procedural pain control in group D was the best ( P<0.01 ). In terms of the analgesic effect, group B and D were better than that group A and C. There was significant difference in Hallucination was more easily detected in group B and C. Systemic recovery was delayed in group B other than group A, C, and D. Basing on the survey, we did found that the family members were more willing to accept pain control treatment for their sick kids under the safety assurance. The compliance was significantly improved in group D. Conclusion : Upon adequate auxiliary breathing preparation and rigorous monitor, propofol combined with low-dose fentanyl was the best sedative/analgesic option for pain control within leukemia patients receiving invasive procedure.The outcome of propofol combined with low-dose fentanyl wasvery safe, satisfactory and compliable. Up to now, this study is the first pain control study for invasive procedure in China mainland, it deserves being paid attention. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
