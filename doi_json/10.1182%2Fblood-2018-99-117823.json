    "abstract_text": "Background : The international prognostic index(IPI) was widely used to predict aggressive lymphoma patients' outcome and to choose the best therapeutic treatment. However, this scale is unsatisfactory in identifying patients who would receive best benefit from rituximab containing regimens. Recently, NLR has been recognized as a poor prognostic indicator in various solid tumors. Here we quantify the prognostic impact of NLR in de novo DLBCL patients. However, various studies of the usefulness of the NLR have used different cut-off values, and the methods of selecting these NLR cut-offs were unclear. Therefore, we verify the adaptive cut-off value. Methods : We retrospectively analyzed 543 patients with de novo DLBCL who diagnosed at Kansai Medical University Hospital and Kansai Medical University Medical Center from January 2003 to December 2017. The prognostic value of NLR at diagnosis was assessed. We put the cut-off of NLR; 3, 4, 5, 6, and evaluate which the most predictive cut-off value is. Results: The median age was 69(20-95) years old, and male was 59%. The Ann Arbor stage III and IV was 60%. The proportion of patients with IPI, Low, Low-intermediate, High-intermediate, High was 36%, 19%, 21%, 24%, respectively. The optimal cutoff for NLR was 6. NLR(6) was associated with overall survival(OS)(HR 1.76, 95%CI: 1.23-2.51, p= 0.002) and progression free survival(PFS) (HR 2.66, 95%CI: 1.65-4.28, p<0.001), either. Multivariate analysis identified NLR(6) remained as a significant factor affecting PFS (hazard ratio: 1.53, 95%CI: 1.02-2.29, p=0.041). Conclusion : Our result revealed that the optimal cut-off for NLR was 6. NLR predicted both OS and PFS of the patients with de novo DLBCL. NLR is a simple and useful scale and it might be a useful marker for prediction of patients' survival or disease progression in patients with de novo DLBCL.
