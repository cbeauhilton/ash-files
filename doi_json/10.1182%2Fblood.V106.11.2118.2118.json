    "abstract_text": "Combination regimens are increasingly being used in CLL. The addition of R to F\u00b1C has increased the complete response (CR) rate in previously untreated patients (pts) with CLL. FCR was given to 300 previously untreated pts with CLL; 70.3% male, 33% Rai stage III-IV, with median value and ranges for age \u2212 57 years (17\u201386), hemoglobin \u2212 12.5G% (6.1\u201318.7), white cell count \u2212 76 x 10 3 /\u03bcl (2.1\u2013620), platelets \u2212 154 x 10 3 /\u03bcl (8\u2013406). 51% had splenomegaly. All pts fulfilled the NCIWG indications for therapy. 72% achieved CR, 10% nodular partial remission (NPR), and 12% PR. The pretreatment characteristic most strongly associated with CR was the beta-2-microglobulin level (P23mg%) were all significantly associated with a lower CR rate (P<.01). CD38 was not associated with CR. Mutation status, ZAP70, and FISH cytogenetics were not routinely measured. Median follow-up was 43 months (18\u201373). Several characteristics were associated with remission duration (R Dur). Multivariate analysis showed that (1) PCR for IgV H , (2) NCIWG response, and (3) flow responses were all independently associated with R Dur. PCR negativity for IgV H was most strongly correlated with R Dur. Seven of 79 PCR negative pts have relapsed at 31, 39, 43, 44, 62, 64, and 67 months.  Response . Patients . 4-Yr.

The median survival for the 300 patients and various prognostic subgroups has not been reached. Second cancers occurred in 53 cases (20 with non-melanomatous skin cancers). Three cases of AML and 3 additional cases of myelodysplastic syndrome occurred. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) or red cell aplasia (RCA) occurred in 25 and 6 cases respectively. These complications remain a significant clinical problem in CLL. There was no significant difference in the IgA or IgM levels over time but a lower mean initial IgG (837\u00b1567mg%) versus 690\u00b1338mg% six months after FCR was completed (P<.005) was noted. 56/72 (78%) who failed or relapsed have been started on salvage therapy. The salvage response rate on retreatment with FCR+alemtuzumab was 9/17 (53%). More pts failing after initial CR or NPR claimed a second response (17/29, 59%) compared with the PR or refractory pts (3/20, 16%; P=.002). Multivariate analysis of characteristics associated with CR rate and survival for FCR and preceding non-R protocols demonstrated a significant advantage for FCR (P<.001). Conclusion When compared with other completed chemotherapy protocols without R, FCR significantly improved CR rate, time-to-progression and treatment failure, and overall survival establishing FCR as the most successful protocol which we have conducted to date."
