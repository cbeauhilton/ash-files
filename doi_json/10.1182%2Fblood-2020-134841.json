    "abstract_text": "Background: Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by thrombocytosis and increased risk of thrombotic events and hemorrhage. Treatment of ET is risk-adapted, focused on preventing thrombosis, bleeding, and minimizing symptoms. Real-world data regarding factors contributing to treatment initiation and therapy choice in this setting are limited. Here, we present the clinical characteristics of low- and high-risk pts with ET enrolled in M yelofibrosis and Essential Thrombocythemia O bservational ST udy (MOST) and assess whether these differ for pts who were treated vs untreated at the time of enrollment. Methods: MOST (NCT02953704) is an ongoing multicenter, non-interventional, longitudinal, prospective, observational study in pts with specific risk categories of ET or MF. Pts included in this analysis met modified ELN criteria (J Clin Oncol. 2011;29:761) for high-risk ET (age \u226560 y and/or thromboembolic event [TE] history) or low-risk ET if receiving ET-directed therapy (not including aspirin only). Data from pt records were entered into an electronic case report form during usual-care visits over a planned observation period of 36 months. Patient-reported symptom burden was assessed using the MPN-Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF); Total Symptom Score (TSS) was calculated (0 [absent] to 100 [worst imaginable]; J Clin Oncol. 2012;30:4098). Data were analyzed with basic descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: Of 1235 pts with ET enrolled at 124 sites between 11/29/2016 and 12/31/2018, 1210 were included in the analysis; 25 were excluded (low-risk receiving aspirin alone [n=16]; low risk receiving neither ET-directed therapy nor aspirin [n=8]; BCR-ABL mutation-positive [n=1]). Of the 1210 pts analyzed, 159 (13.1%) were low-risk (all treated), 887 (73.3%) were high-risk and treated, and 164 (13.6%) were high-risk and untreated, respectively. Reasons for high-risk categorization were similar for treated and untreated high-risk pts (age \u226560 y, 67.5% vs 70.1%; TE history, 8.8% vs 10.4%; both age \u226560 y and TE history, 23.7% vs 19.5%). Pt characteristics are listed in Table 1A . Compared with low risk pts, significantly more high risk pts were JAK2 V617F positive ( P = 0.0143); fewer were CALR positive, and more were MPL positive. Pts with high-risk disease who were untreated had the highest proportion of palpable splenomegaly; mean palpable spleen length below the costal margin was greater in treated pts (low- and high-risk) than in untreated pts. Blood counts were similar across cohorts, except platelets were elevated for untreated high-risk pts. The proportion of pts with comorbidities was similar across cohorts; cardiovascular comorbidities were not as common among low- vs high-risk pts. Mean TSS was highest for low-risk pts, and was similar in both treated and untreated high-risk pts. Fatigue was the most severe symptom in all cohorts. Mean MPN-SAF TSS was significantly higher for low- vs high risk pts ( P = 0.0007), as were several individual symptom scores (abdominal discomfort, P = 0.0081; concentration, P = 0.0014; numbness/tingling, P = 0.0361; night sweats, P < 0.0001; itching, P = 0.0131; bone pain, P = 0.0206; weight loss, P = 0.0469). Physician-reported signs and symptoms were generally more common in low- vs high-risk pts, with differences between risk groups reaching significance for headache ( P = 0.0009) and abdominal pain ( P = 0.0455). Among currently untreated high-risk pts, 40.9% had not received any previous ET-directed therapy. Hydroxyurea (HU) was the most common ET-directed monotherapy at enrollment in both low- and high-risk treated pts (Table 1B) . A small proportion of pts in both low- and high-risk treated groups was receiving >1 ET-directed therapy. Conclusion: These real-world data from the MOST study indicate that despite treatment, low-risk pts had greater patient-reported symptom burden and physician-reported signs/symptoms than high-risk (treated or untreated) pts. This finding suggests that current management (most commonly with HU in this analysis) may not address symptoms in low-risk pts. Notably, nearly 60% of currently untreated high-risk pts had been previously treated, highlighting an unmet need for effective and tolerable second-line treatments in pts with high-risk ET. Further analyses from MOST will help define changes in the clinical and treatment characteristics of pts with ET over time.
