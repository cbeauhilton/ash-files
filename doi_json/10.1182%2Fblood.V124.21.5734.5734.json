    "abstract_text": "Background:Although outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) have improved, it remains an incurable malignancy for which new therapies are needed. Aurora kinases are overexpressed in MM. Inhibition of Aurora A kinase, a key component of the centrosome, in MM cell lines induces apoptotic cell death. Inhibition of Aurora B, a chromosome passenger protein, has therapeutic effects against myeloma lines, primary bone marrow plasma cells and murine xenografts. Histone H3 is a direct downstream substrate of Aurora B. The Aurora A and B kinase inhibitor AT9283 has shown anti-myeloma activity in pre-clinical studies. Based on an NCIC CTG phase I trial in patients with advanced malignancy the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was 40 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle. This single arm phase II trial was designed to explore the efficacy of AT9283 in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Methods: Eligibility criteria included age \u2265 18, neutrophils \u2265 1 and platelets \u2265 70 x10 9 /L. There was no upper limit on the number of prior regimens. The primary endpoint was response rate; secondary endpoints included toxicity and evaluation of potential biomarkers. According to the 2-stage design at least 1 response was required in the first 15 patients to proceed to a full sample size of 30, assuming an H A of \u2265 0.20. Initially AT9283 was administered by 24 hour continuous infusion at the RP2D. Hematological toxicity in the first 2 patients met protocol specified criteria for reduction of the starting dose to 30 mg/m 2 for subsequent patients. Adverse events were graded according to CTCAE V4.0. Phosphorylated Histone H3 (Ser10), a marker of Aurora B activity, and total Histone H3 protein expression was measured by western blot analysis in baseline and day 21 bone marrow samples. Results:Over 18 months, eight eligible patients (3 male, 5 female) with MM (4 IgG, 2 IgA, 2 light chain) were accrued. All were evaluable for toxicity and 7 evaluable for response. Median age was 60 (range 48 \u2013 75). The median number of prior regimens was 3 (range 1 - 5). Patients received between 1 \u2013 4 cycles of AT9283 (median 1) with 25% of patients receiving \u2265 90% of the planned dose intensity. No responses were observed. The trial was closed due to slow accrual and toxicity, in particular myelosuppression. Transient neutropenia occurred in all patients (63% grade 3, 37% grade 4). Recovery from nadir to normal range was rapid in the majority (range 1 \u2013 8 days, median 5) but prolonged in 2 patients who were neutropenic at baseline (11 and 13 weeks). Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 50% of patients. There were 3 infections \u2265 grade 3 including 1 death. Grade 3 skin ulceration thought possibly related to AT9283 by the investigator occurred in 1 patient. The most common non-hematologic adverse events reported as possibly, probably or definitely related to AT9283 were grade 1-3 nausea (50%), grade 1 and 3 vomiting (38%), grade 4 febrile neutropenia (25%), grade 1/2 anorexia (25%), grade 1/2 diarrhea (25%) and grade 1/2 fatigue (25%). Paired baseline and day 21 bone marrow samples were provided from 4 patients; sufficient protein was extracted from both samples for western blot analysis from 3 patients. Of these, 2 showed a reduction in Histone 3 phosphorylation (H3-P) after the first cycle of treatment consistent with inhibition of Aurora B. Both of these patients had a best response of stable disease (SD). Abstract 5734. Table  Patient . Dose (mg/m 2 ) . Number of cycles . Best response . Non-hematological toxicity \u2265 Grade 3* .

No objective responses were observed. Administration of AT9283 to patients with previously treated myeloma at this dose and schedule is associated with toxicity, particularly myelosuppression.
