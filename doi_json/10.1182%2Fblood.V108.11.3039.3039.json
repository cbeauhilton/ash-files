    "abstract_text": "No reports compare autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT vs allo-SCT) for patients (pts) with relapsed (REL) composite low and intermediate grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (L/I-NHL). Fifty four pts with composite L/I-NHL (30 transformed, 16 composite(same site), 8 discordant(different sites)) who underwent allo (n=40) or auto-SCT (n=14) from Jan \u201889 to June \u201805 were evaluated (Table 1) to compare long-term results. Twenty pts (37%) (11/40 allo and 9/14 auto) are alive with median follow-up of 32 months (range 10\u201387). The 2 and 5-y OS for the whole group were 43% [95% confidence interval: 28\u201356%] and 29% [14\u201346%] respectively; the 2 and 5-y EFS 40% [26\u201353%] and 24% [11\u201339 %]. 5-y OS for the auto and allo-SCT were 51% and 23% respectively (p=.09)(Fig. 1). The 2 and 5-y EFS for the allo vs auto-SCT groups were 36% [24\u201355%] vs 54% [33\u201389%] and 27% vs 23% (p=0.4). Thirty four pts (63%) died; 18 (33%) with REL NHL and 16 (30%) with TRM. TRM was due to GVHD (n=7), infection (n=6), cerebral edema (n=1) and veno-occlusive disease (n=1). All but one (cerebral edema) TRM deaths occurred post allo-SCT. The cumulative incidence (CI) of TRM and REL for the whole group were 37% [17\u201357%] and 47% [30\u201364%]. The CI of TRM for allo and auto-SCT were 47% [20\u201374] and 8% [0\u201323%] respectively (p=.009)(Fig. 2). Twenty pts (37%) relapsed post SCT (14/40, 35% allo and 6/14, 43% auto). CI of REL NHL for allo and auto-SCT were 42% [23\u201361%] and 65% (p=.008)(Fig. 2). In conclusion EFS for composite L/I-NHL is low post auto-SCT due to a high relapse rate despite acceptable TRM. While relapse risk is significantly lower post allo-SCT, this advantage is offset by a higher TRM in these pts. Future attempts to reduce TRM while preserving the allogeneic graft vs lymphoma effect may be beneficial. Table 1.
