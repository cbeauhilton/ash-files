    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is characterized by recurrent translocations involving anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and resulting in oncogenic chimeric fusion tyrosine kinases such as NPM-ALK. We integrated mass-spectrometry-driven phosphoproteomics and metabolomics of ALK+ ALCL and discovered that ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) is a candidate substrate of NPM-ALK at residue Y682. ACLY is a critical enzyme responsible for synthesis of acetyl-CoA and connects vital biosynthetic pathways such as carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Functional regulation of ACLY by tyrosine phosphorylation is unknown and the significance of tyrosine phosphorylation of ACLY on cancer cell growth and metabolism have never been described. Methods: To identify novel substrates of NPM-ALK, we performed phospho-proteomic analyses of 3 ALK+ALCL derived cell lines. The MS-phosphoproteomic data were subjected to custom bioinformatic algorithms to identify highly statistically correlated phosphotyrosine proteins and phosphosites regulated by ALK kinase activity. We generated a phosphospecific antibody against a highly-ranked candidate (pACLY Y682) and utilized it in western blot analyses on ALK+ and ALK- ALCL lymphoma cell lines. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on well-characterized primary human ALK+ (n=20) and ALK-ALCL biopsies (n=28) were performed. Co-immunoprecipitations (Co-IP) with HA-tagged ACLY-WT and ACLY-Y682F and ALK antibodies were performed and analyzed by western blot using the pACLY Y682 antibody. In vitro kinase assays were performed to investigate the direct role of NPM-ALK in phosphorylation of ACLY at Y682 using GST-tagged ACLY-WT or ACLY-Y682F peptides in the presence or absence of immunocomplexes containing active NPM-ALK or the kinase-defective K210R mutant. To study the impact of Y682F mutant on lipid metabolism, we generated ALCL-derived cell lines stably transduced to express GFP-tagged ACLY-WT or ACLY-Y682F and subjected them to metabolomic analysis for flux, \u03b2-oxidation or lipid synthesis using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry or gas chromatography platforms. The Seahorse XF24 Flux analyzer was used to measure oxygen consumption rates (OCR) in DEL stably expressing ACLY-WT and ACLY-Y682F. Cells stably expressing ACLY-WT and ACLY-Y682F were evaluated for cell proliferation, colony formation and tumor formation in SCID-BEIGE mouse xenograft models. Results: Phosphoproteomic analyses yielded a dataset containing a total of 626 tyrosine phosphoproteins. Bioinformatic analysis identified pACLY Y682 as a novel candidate substrate of NPM-ALK. Western blot analysis corroborated phosphoproteomic studies and demonstrated that phosphorylation of ALCY at Y682 is regulated by NPM-ALK activity. Expression of active NPM-ALK increased the phosphorylation of ACLY at Y682 in HEK293T cells compared to the K210R mutant. In vitro kinase assays demonstrated that NPM-ALK phosphorylates ACLY at Y682. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of ALK and co-IP (HA) demonstrated interaction of NPM-ALK and ACLY in co-transfected HEK293T cell lysates. Stable expression of ACLY-Y682F or pharmacologic antagonism of ALK with crizotinib resulted in decreased ACLY activity, decreased lipid synthesis and increased fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation when compared to ACLY-WT. \u03b2-oxidation of 13 C-oleic acid-labeled fatty acid demonstrated increased labeling of +2-citrate (p<0.01) and +18-Oleyol carnitine (p<0.001) in ACLY-Y682F cells when compared to ACLY-WT. Similarly, the OCR was significantly increased in cells expressing ACLY-Y682F (p<0.001). IHC studies of ALCL biopsies (ALK+ and ALK-) demonstrated significant correlation between NPM-ALK and ACLY pY682- expression (p<0.01). Expression of ACLY-Y682F in the DEL cell line resulted in dramatically decreased cell proliferation, impaired clonogenic potential as observed by small colony size in colony formation assay and abrogated tumor growth in in vivo xenograft model when compared to ACLY-WT. Conclusion : We identify for the first time a direct tyrosine kinase-mediated mechanism for ACLY regulation. In this regard, our studies demonstrate a novel oncogenic mechanism whereby NPM-ALK controls lipid synthesis and b-oxidation by phosphorylation of ACLY at Y682 and this mechanism contributes to ALCL pathogenesis. Our findings have significant implications for novel therapies targeting tumor metabolism in ALCLs. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
