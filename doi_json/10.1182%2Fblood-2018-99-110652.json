    "abstract_text": "Background: Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) is one of the most common conditions encoutered by the pediatric hematologist. Current first-line therapy includes: observation without drug therapy, corticosteroids and intravenous immune globulin. A minority of patients are refractory to first-line approaches. Second-line treatment options are: immunosuppressive agents and thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RA). Eltrombopag and Romiplostin are TPO-RA licensed for clinical use. Eltrombopag is, actually, the only TPO-RA approved in Italy (since two years ago) for children, over one year old, with a chronic and/or refractory ITP. Real life data of Eltrombopag are limited. Methods: We performed an Italian multicenter retrospective survey to study the clinical on-label use of TPO-RA, focus on Eltrombopag, in pediatric ITP. Our aims were, primarily, to bring out the prevalence of the use in clinical practice and secondarily to collect data on efficacy and toxicity. Results: We enrolled 69 pediatric ITP subjects from 15 Italian treatment centers (TC). 4 patients received Romiplostin as TPO-RA and were excluded by the analysis. 36/65 patients weer female (55%). Median age at ITP diagnosis: 6 years + 6 months (min 1 y + 2 m; max 16 y + 7 m). Median age at first Eltrombopag assumption: 11 years + 5 months (min 2 y + 0 m; max 17 y + 8 m). Accounting in 344 the total number of chronic ITP subjects treated by TC in the same observation period (July 2016-June 2018), we observed an Eltrombopag clinical use prevalence of 0.19 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.26). We underlined a \"no response\" to Eltrombopag (platelet count persistently less than 30000 per microliter) in 16/65 (25%); a \"partial response\" (platelet count between 30000 and 100000 per microliter) in 14/65 (21%) and a \"complete response\" (platelet count persistently up than 100000 per microliter) in 35/65 (54%). The overall response (partial or complete) was described in 49/65 (75%) children. During the follow up was seen in 16/49 (33%) subjects with initial response a platelet rise that waned to no response. There was no evidence of significant adverse events (clinicians are obliged, to monthly surveillance, by Italian drug agency for hypertransaminasemia and peripheral smear cell abnormalities). Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that Eltrombopag is a therapeutic option quite considered by Italian clinicians. Moreover, according with the percentages of clinical trials, Eltrombopag is safe and effective to rise platelet count. Further studies need to emphasize how factors favor a complete response and to know the incidence of long-term adverse effects. A prospective study designed and driven by Italian Association of Pediatric Hematology Oncology (AIEOP) Coagulation Disorders Working Group is, already, in progress.
