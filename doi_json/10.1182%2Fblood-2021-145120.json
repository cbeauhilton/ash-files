    "abstract_text": "In addition to genetic aberrations, accumulating evidence indicates that deregulation of histone methyltransferases, such as MMSET, EZH2 and KDM6A, plays crucial roles in the oncogenic transformation and development of multiple myeloma (MM). For example, overexpression of MMSET leading to a global increase in H3K36me2, is believed to be the driving force in the pathogenesis of t (4;14) MM. However, as the histone methyltransferase is responsible for H3K36me3, the role of SETD2 is not been known in myeloma. To explore the possible clinical value of SETD2 in MM, we first examined the gene expression profile from GEO database, which indicated that the SETD2 expression was significantly decreased in MM patients when compared with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smoldering multiple myeloma patients (GSE6477). Moreover, the expression of SETD2 decreased with the advanced international staging system stage of MM patients (GSE19784). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that low expression of SETD2 was significantly associated with a poor overall survival in MM patients (GSE2658, P<0.05; GSE9782, P<0.001). Thus, our analysis suggests that SETD2 might participate in cancer progression and could become a biomarker for the prognosis of patients with MM. We then investigated the biological role and the underlying mechanism of SETD2 in MM. Firstly, we used lentiviral-mediated RNA interference to knockdown SETD2 (SETD2 KD) in MM cell lines (RPMI8226 and MM.1S). CCK8 and colony-forming assays showed that reduced expression of SETD2 significantly promoted MM cell proliferation and colony growth. BrdU incorporation assay revealed increased DNA synthesis in SETD2 KD MM cells. Then, treatment with JIB-04, a small molecule inhibitor targeting H3K36me3 loss in SETD2 KD MM cells showed that H3K36me3 recovery was capable of reversing the tumor-promoting effect due to SETD2 down-regulation of MM cells in vitro . Moreover, the xenograft growth assay revealed that SETD2 down-regulation facilitated tumor growth and JIB-04 treatment exhibited anti-myeloma activity in vivo . Therefore, we conclude that SETD2 plays an important role in MM maintenance, and inhibition of H3K36me3 shows therapeutic efficacy for MM. To further explore the underlying mechanisms, we performed the RNA-Seq analysis and discovered that low H3K36me3 level was associated with reduced expression of CDKN1A and increased expression of TNFRSF17 (BCMA) and c-Myc in MM cells. The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that MAPK signaling pathway was enriched in SETD2 knockdown and JIB-04 treated MM cells. Subsequent Western blotting analysis further confirmed that SETD2 KD cells had increased JNK activation, while JIB-04 treated group showed decreased level of p-JNK. To investigate whether BCMA was the directly transcriptional target for H3K36me3, we carried out a dual-luciferase reporter assay in both SETD2 KD and JIB-04 treated MM cells, and confirmed that H3K36me3 inhibited the expression of BCMA through physically interacting with motifs in its promoter. Furthermore, down-regulation of BCMA in SETD2 KD MM cells could lead to a reduction of p-JNK and an up-regulation of CDKN1A, and resulting inhibited cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Furthermore, blockage of the JNK pathway by its inhibitor SP600125 resulted in significant inhibition of MM cell proliferation induced by SETD2 knockdown. Additionally, suppression of c\u2010Myc using 10058\u2010F4 inhibited proliferation, and induced cell cycle arrest as well as CDKN1A expression in SETD2 KD MM cells. These results indicate that BCMA/JNK and c-Myc pathways were involved in STED2 and H3K36me3 mediated cell proliferation in MM. Together, our data delineate that SETD2-dependent H3K36me3 modification plays a critical role in regulation cell proliferation and cell cycle by BCMA-JNK and c-Myc pathways in MM cells. Targeting the SETD2-H3K36me3 pathway represents a promising therapy for MM. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
