    "abstract_text": "Introduction: New treatment options like thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TRAs) and rituximab have been introduced into the clinic which have found their way into national and international treatment guidelines. The aim of this study was to answer the following questions concerning diagnosis and treatment of patients with ITP in routine care: How are patients diagnosed and treated? Which sequences of therapy are applied? How many patients die due to bleeding complications? Methods: All patients with ITP diagnosed between 06/1995-06/2014 in a community-based oncology group practice in Germany were analyzed retrospectively. Results: 402 patients with a median age of 55 (7-90) were evaluated. 57% were female and 43% male. 357 (89%) were classified as primary ITP and 311 (77%) as having chronic ITP. In 234 patients (58%) a bone marrow biopsy was part of the diagnostic work up. Only 191 patients (48%) needed therapy. First line therapy (n=191) were steroids in 81%, intravenous immunoglobulins (ivIgG) in 12% and ivIgG plus steroids in 6%. Second line therapy (n=102) were ivIgG in 49%, steroids in 23%, ivIgG plus steroids in 17%, other immunosuppressive agents in 11% and splenectomy in 5%. Third line therapy (n=63) was splenectomy in 22%, other immunosuppressive agents in 27%, steroids in 19%, ivIgG in 16%, 11% combination therapy, rituximab in 10% and TRAs in 5%. Fourth line therapy (n=38) consisted of steroids in 26%, splenectomy in 26%, immunosuppressive agents in 34%, ivIgG in 13%, rituximab in 11% and TRAs in 3%. Patients received a median of 2 lines (1-10) of therapy. Treatment modalities most frequently used were steroids in 93%, immunoglobulins in 56%, splenectomy in 21% and other immunosuppressive agents in 21% of patients. Rituximab and TRAs were used in 10% and 5% only. 75% of patients received a durable remission (complete or partial) after their last therapy. 10% showed no response, in 15% remission couldn't be evaluated due to external treatments. 146 patients (76%) are off treatment. 1 patient (0.2%) died due to bleeding complications. Conclusions: Bone marrow biopsy is used as a diagnostic procedure in 58% of patients. Treatment modalities most frequently used are steroids, immunoglobulins, splenectomy and other immunosuppressive agents. Rituximab and TRAs are used infrequently. A high percentage of ITP-patients achieve durable remissions and ITP-related mortality is low. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
