    "abstract_text": "Pre-clinical data in monkeys receiving non-myeloablative conditioning followed by MHC-mismatched kidney and bone marrow transplantation show that transient chimerism is sufficient to permit achievement of long-term tolerance to a simultaneous donor renal allograft. Our group has recently reported successful induction of tolerance to donor kidneys in patients with advanced multiple myeloma and renal failure through combined bone marrow and kidney transplantation in the HLA-identical setting. On the basis of these results, five end-stage renal failure patients without malignant disease received simultaneous kidney and bone marrow transplantation from haploidentical HLA mismatched related donor after non-myeloablative conditioning with MEDI-507 (anti-CD2 humanized mAb; MedImmune), cyclophosphamide, thymic irradiation and peritransplant cyclosporine. Transplantation of kidney and bone marrow were both performed on Day 0. All patients developed initial mixed chimerism but lost their chimerism by Day 21. We have analyzed three patients who successfully discontinued immunosuppression on Days +240, +422 and +244. At a follow-up of 47, 38, and 17 months, all three patients are off immunosuppression without allograft rejection. T-cell counts exceeded 100 cells/\u03bcL by Day +128, +21, +21, respectively, and a high early prevalence of CD4 + CD25 high cells was detected. Post-transplant in vitro alloreactivity assays (bulk MLR/CML) showed the development of long-lasting donor-specific unresponsiveness in all three patients. In patients in whom renal tubular epithelial cells (RTEC) were cultured from the donor kidney, no killing of donor RTEC was detected post-transplant. We also assessed alloresponses in chemorefractory lymphoma patients receiving haploidentical bone marrow transplantation with a similar conditioning regimen. In contrast to the recipients of combined kidney/bone marrow transplants, these patients showed sustained global hyporesponsiveness in CML and MLR. However, loss of donor chimerism was associated with the eventual appearance of measurable anti-donor CML and/or MLR responses. In contrast, donor-specific and host-specific unresponsiveness with strong anti-3 rd party responses developed in a sustained mixed chimera who received haploidentical stem cell transplantation with a modification of this conditioning protocol (i.e. different dose of MEDI-507, Isolex-selected CD34 + cells from G-CSF mobilized PBMC and the addition of fludarabine). In summary, we have obtained proof of principle that durable multilineage mixed chimerism with donor- and host-specific tolerance can be achieved without GVHD in humans receiving haploidentical HCT. In recipients of combined kidney/bone marrow transplants but not in recipients of bone marrow alone, patients who lose chimerism develop donor-specific unresponsiveness. These studies point to a role for the renal allograft in maintaining long-term tolerance following loss of initial donor chimerism."
