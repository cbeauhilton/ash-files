    "abstract_text": "Introduction Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by genomic instability and eventual poor outcome. Aberrations in DNA repair-related pathways have been considered to explain the instability. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is an important pathway involved in the removal of bulky adducts and DNA crosslinks induced by various genotoxins. Little is known about the relationship between NER in MM biology and patient outcomes. Here we assess the role of NER in MM. Methods We evaluated NER efficiency in a panel of MM cell lines (n=18), with a functional assay based on the purified DNA-Damage Binding protein 2 (DDB2) complex (DDB2 proteo-probe, Dreze et al. 2014). NER proficiency was correlated with cytogenetic characteristics, p53 status, sequencing data, gene expression profile, and with melphalan (MLP) sensitivity evaluated by CellTiterGlo (CTG). We then evaluated NER efficiency in patient samples and interrogated the role of NER in MM patients by correlating expression of NER genes with survival (OS) in a cohort of 170 patients (IFM 2005-01) homogeneously treated with alkylating agents. Results NER, measured as the amount of (6-4) photoproducts remaining 2 hours after UV irradiation, showed variability between MM cell lines. Out of 18 cell lines, 7 exhibited various levels of NER deficiencies, defined as less than 90% repair at 2 hours (4 cell lines 90-70% and 3 cell lines <60%). The other 11 cell lines presented more than 90% of repair. P53 loss of function did not associate with NER deficiency. Notably, all t(4;14) cell lines tested (n=5) showed a NER repair rate > 90%. NER deficient cell lines (NER <90%) were sensitive to melphalan. However all melphalan sensitive cells did not exhibit NER deficiency, This suggests that other DNA repair pathways are involved in the repair of melphalan-induced lesions. Furthermore, we performed the assay in patient samples showing variable levels of NER, which may reflect different disease status and prognosis. Whole genome sequencing data from 6 NER deficient cell lines revealed missense mutations in critical NER genes in 2 of these cell lines. MM1S and MM1R cells showed mutations in the Xeroderma Pigmentosum Complementation Group A (XPA) gene (mutation D70H), and MM1R was also mutated in the Cockayne syndrome, ERCC6 gene (mutation L682I). Gene expression profile comparison in 12 of these showed a positive correlation between expression of NER genes and NER efficiency. We next studied expression of 20 NER genes in 170 patients treated with high dose melphalan (IFM 2005-01). The analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between 5 overexpressed NER genes (ERCC3, ERCC4, ERCC6, MMS19 and NTHL1) and overall survival (OS). Conclusion NER efficiency is heterogeneous in MM, in part due to acquired mutations. Impairment of NER is associated with outcome as well as may contribute to genomic instability. Ability to proficiently measure NER in patient samples provides us an opportunity to now evaluate NER as a prognostic marker in myeloma. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
