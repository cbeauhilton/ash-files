    "abstract_text": "Initial clinical trials of adoptive immunotherapy have shown that the efficacy of adoptively transferred T-cells in man is often limited by the failure of cultured T cells, particularly cloned CD8 T cells, to persist in vivo. These studies demonstrated that the transferred T cells induced only transient responses and that persistence of the transferred T-cell clonotypes correlated with disease regression. A previous study suggested that CMV virus-specific CD8 T cell clones derived from central memory T cells (T CM ), but not effector memory T cells (T EM ), persisted long-term in non-human primates. On the other hand, another study comparing T CM and T EM derived SIV virus specific CD8 T-cell clones that were adoptively transferred in non-human primates demonstrated limited persistence of both T CM and T EM derived transferred T cells, and failed to show any difference between the two cell types. Because of these conflicting data, we have reexamed the persistence of adoptively transferred viral antigen specific T-cells derived from T CM and T EM population. Accordingly, we developed a NOG mouse model for studying the ability of human CMVpp65-specific T cells derived from central memory and effector memory populations to migrate to and accumulate in human tumor xenografts expressing CMVpp65, to alter the growth of these tumors and to persist in the tumors. This model also allows us to test immunomodulating agents and their ability to enhance targeted T-cell accumulations, antitumor activity and persistence. We analyzed CMVpp65-specific CD8 T cells derived from T CM and T EM precursors in vitro and in vivo . To tract the T-cells in vivo , we transduced membrane-bound Gaussia luciferase into T CM and T EM populations and monitored T cell trafficking by in vivo bioluminescence. Contrary to expectation, our results initially showed no differences between T CM and T EM derived CMVpp65-specific T-cell in mice co-treated with IL-2 in the time to accumulation, ultimate level of accumulation, degree of CMVpp65 + tumor regression or T-cell persistence. However, in mice cotreated with IL-15/IL-15R\u03b1 complex, both T CM and T EM exhibited more sustained engraftment and more prolonged accumulation in both the targeted tumor and in the marrow. In mice treated with IL-15/IL-15R\u03b1, T CM and T EM derived T cells showed a similar effector memory phenotype and a similar level of regression of tumor growth. Thus, adoptive transfer of CMVpp65 specific T CM or T EM when combined with IL-15/IL-15R\u03b1 complex may support better persistence of antigen-specific T-cells following adoptive immunotherapy. Studies comparing IL-15/IL-15R\u03b1 complex with IL-15 alone are in progress. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
