    "abstract_text": "Alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) binds \u03b1 hemoglobin (Hb) to stabilize its structure and limit its chemical reactivity in vitro and in vivo . Addition of \u03b2 Hb to \u03b1 Hb-AHSP displaces AHSP to form HbA (\u03b1 2 \u03b2 2 ) tetramer. Recently, we determined that binding of AHSP to free \u03b1 Hb generates a novel structure in which the helix F of \u03b1 Hb is disordered and the heme iron is reduced to the ferrous form and coordinated by the distal histidine (ferrous \u03b1 Hb-AHSP). Over time, the heme iron within this complex oxidizes to the ferric form (ferric \u03b1 Hb-AHSP) and the F helix reorders, generating a bis-histidyl heme iron that exhibits decreased capacity to catalyze the formation of reactive oxygen species. At room temperature in ambient oxygen, the conversion of ferrous to ferric \u03b1 Hb-AHSP occurs over several hours. We proposed that in vivo , these complexes could serve as transient intermediates to maintain \u03b1 Hb in a stable state until \u03b2 Hb is available to form tetrameric HbA. The current study addresses two questions related to this hypothesis: Does bis-histidyl ferric \u03b1 Hb-AHSP form more readily under physiologic conditions? Can ferrous and ferric \u03b1 Hb-AHSP complexes form functional tetrameric HbA upon reaction with \u03b2 Hb? The conversion of ferrous to ferric \u03b1 Hb-AHSP is temperature-dependent with complete conversion occurring in 40 minutes at 37\u00b0C, as opposed to 5 hours at 22\u00b0C. Furthermore, the conversion is accelerated by partial oxygen saturation, increasing the likelihood that ferric-AHSP Hb will form in vivo . Using cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis, we demonstrated that \u03b2 Hb displaces AHSP to form tetrameric HbA from both \u03b1 Hb-AHSP complexes. The resulting tetramer from ferrous \u03b1 Hb-AHSP is similar to HbA, both spectroscopically and in terms of oxygen binding. In contrast, the Hb tetramer formed from ferric \u03b1 Hb-AHSP and \u03b2 Hb is similar to HbY (\u03b1FeIII 2 \u03b2FeII 2 ) spectroscopically. However, the \u03b1 globin heme iron within this tetrameric complex appears to be occluded, as the rate of cyanide binding is reduced. Furthermore, it is resistant to reduction by sodium dithionite or methemoglobin reductase, suggesting that the \u03b1 Hb retains its bis-histidyl nature. Together, these studies show that both \u03b1 Hb-AHSP complexes are likely to form under physiological conditions. Upon interaction with \u03b2 Hb, ferrous \u03b1 Hb-AHSP forms functional Hb A tetramer. In contrast, ferric \u03b1 Hb-AHSP is more chemically inert, but may not be able to form viable HbA.",
