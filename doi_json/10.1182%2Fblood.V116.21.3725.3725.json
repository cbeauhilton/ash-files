    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3725 Deficient thymopoiesis, due to epithelial injury by chemo- and/or radiotherapy, age-associated thymic involution and by graft-versus-host disease, is an important determinant of the impaired immune competence following allogeneic transplantation. Therefore, strategies to improve thymopoiesis are considered pivotal to improve T cell recovery and immune competence after transplantation. As SCF is a cytokine produced by thymic stroma and its receptor, c-kit, is expressed by the earliest thymocytes, we evaluated whether SCF administration would improve thymic recovery following stem cell transplantation in immuno-deficient mice receiving: (1) a T-cell depleted bone marrow (BM) graft of congenic mice, or (2) a CD34 + CD38 low -selected xenogenic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) graft of human fetal liver origin (HIS) mice model). In the mouse-mouse model, 10\u201312 week old rag-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice were 3 Gy irradiated ( 137 Cs -source) and received 2\u00d710 5 T-cell depleted C57Bl/6 (CD45.1) congeneic bone marrow cells intravenously. Recipient mice received either PBS or recombinat rat SCF (Amgen, USA, 100\u03bcg/kg per injection) by subcutaneous injection 3 times a week from day 1 until the end of the experiment. In this model, SCF enhanced thymopoiesis and peripheral T-cell recovery. BM lymphoid progenitor recovery was not affected. Median thymic cellularity increased from 0.9 in PBS- to 266 \u00d7 10 4 /thymus in SCF-treated mice (p=0.05), which increase was similarly distributed over the thymocyte subsets of double negative (DN), double positive (DP), and CD4+, CD8+ single positive thymocytes. Next, we assessed whether SCF-induced improved thymic recovery also translated into improved T-cell recovery in the periphery. Absolute numbers of donor-derived newly developed CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells were quantified in peripheral blood, spleen and lymph nodes at weeks 4 and 6 post-transplantation. T-cell numbers were low at 4 weeks after transplantation and did not differ between PBS or SCF treated animals. However, at 6 weeks T-cell numbers were significantly increased in spleen and lymph nodes of SCF treated animals (p<0.05). Next, we studied the effect of recombinant human (rh) SCF in our HIS mouse model. In short, newborn (days 3\u20137) Rag-2 \u2212/\u2212 gc \u2212/\u2212 mice were 3.5 Gy irradiated and transplanted with 5\u201310 \u00d7 10 4 CD34 + CD38 low human fetal liver (FL) cells intra-hepatically. CD34 + CD38 low cells were isolated via a two step procedure. CD34 + \u2212 FL cells were isolated using a CD34 human progenitor cell-isolation kit and further sorted as CD38 low using a FACS Aria (BD biosciences). In HIS mice, PBS or rhSCF (Amgen, USA) 100\u03bcg/kg per injection) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) 3 times weekly as of day 14 following transplantation. Similar to the murine BMT model, a higher thymic cellularity was observed in SCF treated mice ( Fig. 1 ) in the HIS model. DN and early DP thymocyte subsets were enhanced, albeit not significantly. In contrast, lateDP, CD4SP and CD8SP thymocyte subset recovery was significantly enhanced in thymi of SCF-treated HIS mice. As the HIS model remains a hybrid human\u2013mouse system with limited cytokine cross reactivity and in which MHC-HLA mismatch compromises peripheral T-cell survival (Legrand et al J IMMUNOL 2009), the model did not allow us to study the effect of SCF on T-cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs.

Newborn rag-2\u2212/\u2212 \u03b3c\u2212/\u2212 mice were 3.5 Gy irradiated and received 5\u201310 \u00d7 104 CD34+CD38low human fetal liver cells intra-hepatically and were treated with PBS or SCF. At indicated times post transplantation, thymi were harvested analyzed for the human thymocyte subsets: TN (CD3-CD4-CD8-), early DP (CD3- CD4+CD8+), late DP (CD3+CD4+CD8+), CD4SP and CD8SP (CD3+CD4-CD8+).

Newborn rag-2\u2212/\u2212 \u03b3c\u2212/\u2212 mice were 3.5 Gy irradiated and received 5\u201310 \u00d7 104 CD34+CD38low human fetal liver cells intra-hepatically and were treated with PBS or SCF.

Close modal Collectively, these results show that SCF may significantly improve post-transplant thymopoiesis after both experimental murine BMT and human fetal liver HSC transplantation in HIS mice. While peripheral T-cell recovery was significantly enhanced in the murine BMT model, it remains to be established whether improved human thymopoiesis will also translate into better peripheral T-cell recovery and enhanced immune competence towards opportunistic infections as well as a better recovery of regulatory T cells. These studies now set the stage for studying SCF, either alone or combined with other thymopoietic cytokines, in a larger pre-clinical animal model.
