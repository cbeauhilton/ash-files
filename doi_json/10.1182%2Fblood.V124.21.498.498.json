    "abstract_text": "The results of gene expression profiling (GEP) and immunohistochemical studies indicate that survival is worsened by macrophages (M\u03a6) in the tumor microenvironment of various B-cell lymphomas including follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are known to be different from other types of M\u03a6, but the effects of TAMs that worsen prognosis in B-cell lymphoma are essentially unknown, as are the mechanisms of these effects. Here, we determined the phenotype and effects of TAMs on tumor survival, proliferation, and drug resistance in B-cell lymphomas and evaluated strategies to reverse their effects. As compared to peripheral blood monocytes (Mo) from normal donors (ND), Mo from FL patients were differentiated less into M1 M\u03a6 (defined as CD68 + CD163 lo CD206 lo CD86 hi ) by culture with CSF-1 for 5 days followed by IFN-g + LPS for 2 days more. In contrast, Mo from FL patients and ND were differentiated similarly into M2 M\u03a6 (defined as CD68 + CD163 hi CD206 hi CD86 lo ) by culture with CSF-1 followed by IL-4. Consistent with this, M\u03a6 gene signatures from FL tumors were more similar to previously-described signatures of M2 rather than M1 M\u03a6 (Martinez et al, J Immunol, 2006, 177(10):7303-11). In co-culture, primary FL tumor cells and lymphoma cell lines (including RL, a transformed FL cell line; Granta 519, a mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell line; and Raji, a Burkitt lymphoma cell line) induced differentiation of Mo into M\u03a6. Differentiation could be prevented by CS4 monoclonal antibody (mAb), a fully human IgG1 anti-human CSF-1R mAb (ImClone/Eli Lilly), but not isotype control Ab. Elevated levels of CSF-1 in culture supernatants after addition of CS4 mAb and real-time PCR of tumor cells suggested secretion of CSF-1 by lymphoma cells. Spontaneous apoptosis of primary FL and MCL tumor cells, determined by Annexin V and propidium iodide staining, was significantly reduced by co-culture with ND Mo (p<0.01), whether pre-differentiated into M\u03a6 with CSF-1 or not, but this protection could be reversed by CS4 mAb. Mo and/or pre-differentiated M\u03a6 protected primary FL and MCL tumor cells from cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin and/or bendamustine (p<0.01), but CS4 mAb reversed this effect. To assess effects of M\u03a6 on proliferation, lymphoma cell lines (RL, Granta 519, and Raji) were CFSE-labeled prior to co-culture with Mo and doxorubicin, and proliferation assessed by CFSE dilution by flow cytometry in the presence or absence of CS4 or isotype control mAbs. M\u03a6 promoted proliferation of all three cell lines, but this effect could be reversed by CS4 mAb. To further understand the mechanism by which M\u03a6 promote tumor survival and growth, we performed phosflow analysis and found increased phosphorylation of STAT3 in co-cultured lymphoma cells. Consistent with this, we observed a correlation between an 11-gene STAT3 activation signature, described by Huang et al in DLBCL tumors (J Clin Oncol, 2013, 52.8414), and a M\u03a6 gene signature in whole genome GEP studies of 191 FL tumors (Pearson correlation co-efficient=0.396, p<0.001). In conclusion, our results suggest that Mo from FL patients are predisposed to differentiate into an M2-like M\u03a6 state. The interaction between lymphoma cells and Mo/M\u03a6 is reciprocal: a change in Mo (M\u03a6 differentiation) induced by interaction with lymphoma tumor cells leads to a change in the tumor cells (promotion of survival, proliferation, and chemoresistance). More importantly, our results demonstrate that targeting TAMs using CS4, an anti-CSF-1R mAb, can be an effective strategy to overcome the adverse effects of TAMs and reverse chemoresistance. Further studies are needed to determine whether STAT3 activation contributes to the protumor effects of TAMs. This may provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms related to TAMs and lymphoma cells and offers additional targets for therapeutic development. In the long term, strategies targeting TAMs is especially appealing, as they should be able to be combined with existing therapies including chemotherapy, other immunotherapy, and targeted therapy, potentially improving their efficacy without increasing toxicity for FL, DLBCL, and other B-cell malignancies.
