    "abstract_text": "Background: R-DHAP regimen (rituximab, cisplatin, dexamethasone, high dose cytarabine) based on the 1988 Velasquez's study is a standard scheme used to treat relapsed Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Cisplatin is frequently substituted with oxaliplatin to avoid nephrotoxicity, resulting in R-DHAX that is currently prescribed in first or second line treatment for aggressive NHL. However data are scarce. We compared the nephrotoxicity of cisplatine to oxaliplatine in R-DHA-platinum in this setting. Methods: All consecutive patients with NHL treated by R-DHAP or R-DHAX in Angers hospital between the 1st January 2007 and the 31th December 2014 were included. Either cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 during 24 hours (R-DHAP) or oxaliplatin 130 mg/m 2 during 2 hours (R-DHAX) were associated at d1 with cytarabine (2000 mg/m 2 during 3 hours, two doses, d 2), dexamethasone (40 mg, d 1-4) and rituximab (375mg/m 2 , d 1) (Details on table 1). Cisplatin dosage were reduced from 25% to 50% according to individual renal tolerance. Up to 6 courses were delivered. Serum creatinine was recorded before each course of chemotherapy and was checked between d3 and d15 after administration, allowing to trace individual profiles of trajectories for their levels. These trajectories were clusterized in order to detect the existence of homogeneous patterns of evolution. This is a classical, semiparametric group-based statistical approach (Ref 1). Concomitant nephrotoxic drugs and events (sepsis\u2026) were recorded to identify potential bias. Results: 21 patients received R-DHAP and 32 received R-DHAX. 6 patients switched from R-DHAP to R-DHAX due to nephrotoxicity. 2 different homogeneous clusters appeared. Cluster A included a majority of R-DHAX: 31 R-DHAX (88.6%), 3 R-DHAP (8.6%), 1 R-DHAP who changed to R-DHAX (2.9%). Cluster B contained a majority of R-DHAP: 11 R-DHAP (64.7%), 1 R-DHAX (5.9%), 5 R-DHAP to R-DHAX (29.4%) (p = 7.5.10 -9 ). Cluster A graphic profile appeared less toxic than cluster B according to average serum creatinine level (mean cluster A: 70.2 \u00b5mol/L; mean cluster B: 99.5 \u00b5mol/L (p = 2.2.10 -16 )). Patients treated with R-DHAP experienced more severe renal failure than patients treated with R-DHAX (Chi-square test: p = 2.9.10 -8 , table 2). Nephrotoxic concomitant treatments have no significant discriminant effect. No differences were observed between either R-DHAP versus R-DHAX or cluster A versus B patients, as regards to age, sex, malnutrition status, histology, stage of the lymphoma, performans status, comorbidities including renal comorbidities and the history of nephrotoxic therapy. No significant difference was shown in OS and EFS (respectively, p = 0.463 and p = 0.290). Conclusions: Although R-DHAX is now widely used in NHL treatment, our study is one of the first to evaluate efficacy and renal tolerance of this treatment. R-DHAX nephrotoxicity is not significant whereas most patients receiving R-DHAP had significant acute renal impairment. We found no difference as regards to survival. A prospective study should compare these schedules in NHL to adapt future practices and improve morbidity. Table 1. Patients characteristics  Caract\u00e9ristics . DHAP . DHAX . Total .
