    "abstract_text": "Background : Literature regarding the association of aging and stem cell numbers is conflicting. No compelling evidence exists that hematopoietic stem cell numbers decline with age. Early progenitor cells represent only a fraction of total CD34 cells. The ratio of CFU-GM/CD34 provides a relative estimate of the proportion of primitive hematopoietic stem cells in the stem cell compartment. The hypothesis is that primitive stem cell numbers decrease with age. Methods: This study describes the relationship between the CFU-GM/CD34+ ratio (categorized as quartiles) and donor characteristics in 108 normal donors of cytokine mobilized hematopoietic stem cells for allogeneic transplant between 6/1995 and 11/2003. The relationship between the CFU-GM/CD 34+ and cell collection characteristics were also studied. Donor characteristics included: age, gender, race/ethnicity, ABO blood group, weight, height, body surface area (BSA); collection characteristics included: total number of mononuclear cells/kg (MNC), CFU-GM/kg (Colony Forming Unit- Granulocyte Monocyte), CD34+ cells/kg and the ratio of CFU-GM/CD34 collected. Results : The median age of the donors was 42.5 years with range from 10.9 years to 71.4 years. The median CFU-GM/CD34 ratio was 0.060 with range from 0.009 to 0.248. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that higher MNC numbers were associated with a significantly higher CFU-CM/CD34 ratio (p<0.01). No significant decrease in the CFU-GM/CD34 ratio was found with increasing age indicating no general compromise in the stem cell compartment of donors with aging. A non-significant association of the CFU-GM/CD34 ratio to donor gender (p=0.071) and BSA (p=0.072) was also observed. CONCLUSION : No significant decline in donor hematopoietic stem cell compartment was seen with aging. Relationship of CFU-GM/CD34+ Ratio Quartiles to Donor and Collection characteristics  .
