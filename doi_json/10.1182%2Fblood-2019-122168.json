    "abstract_text": "Clonal proliferation of megakaryoblasts, called transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM), is a rare disease of newborns triggered by trisomy 21 (constitutional or somatic) together with acquired mutations of GATA1 resulting in the exclusive production of its short variant - GATA1s. No other TAM drivers have been described so far. We have diagnosed a unique TAM case with a typical clinical and laboratory manifestation but without the gain (or any other aberration) of chromosome 21. Thorough genomic profiling revealed 4 somatic mutations: GATA1 D65_C228del, JAK1 F636del, FN1 R2420C and SPIRE2 R471W. With respect to the generally accepted 2-hit theory, we hypothesized that this TAM arose from a collaboration of the atypical GATA1 mutation (not inducing GATA1s) with (at least) one of the other identified mutations. Unlike SPIRE2 and FN1 aberrations, various mutations of the JAK1 kinase have been previously described as leukemia drivers, suggesting JAK1 F636del as a top candidate for the second hit. Moreover, JAK1 mutations have been associated with the transformation of TAM into acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (Nikolaev et al., Blood, 2013). The aim of our project was to functionally characterize this novel JAK1 mutation. Phenylalanine 636 belongs to a phylogenetically conserved triad of amino acids suggested to control catalytic activity of JAK1 via mediating a switch between the supposedly active and inactive conformations (Toms et al., Nat Struct Mol Biol, 2013). Hence, F636 seems to be essential for JAK1 function. Surprisingly, homology modeling showed that loss of F636 is compatible with both functionally opposite conformations. Indeed, Western blot analysis of JAK/STAT signaling in transiently transformed HEK293T cells showed that catalytic activity is preserved in JAK1 F636del. However, we observed lower levels of auto- and STATs- phosphorylation compared to wild-type (wt) JAK1 suggesting decreased kinase activity of JAK1 F636del. Subsequently, we tested the oncogenic potential of JAK1 F636del in the Ba/F3 cell assay; unlike the known oncogenic JAK1 variant (JAK1 V658I), JAK1 F636del did not induce IL3-independent growth. To further assess phenotypic impact of F636del, we introduced JAK1 F636del into murine bone marrow and fetal liver hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) using lentiviruses and performed colony forming assays. The number and morphology of colonies did not differ in JAK1 F636del compared to wt JAK1. Furthermore, we assessed the impact of JAK1 F636del in the context of mutated GATA1. We utilized the in-vitro model recently described by Labuhn et al. (Cancer Cell, 2019), in which the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated induction of Gata1s expression leads to the expansion and sustained proliferation of fetal liver HSPCs from embryonic day 13.5 ROSA26:Cas9-EGFP ki/wt mice. Similar to wt JAK1, lentivirally introduced JAK1 F636del had no impact on the proliferation and maturation status of such Gata1-edited HPSCs irrespective of the timing of its introduction (simultaneously with Gata1 editing versus into fully established Gata1-edited culture) or of culturing conditions (fully cytokine-supplemented growth-supportive versus cytokine-depleted growth-restrictive medium). Altogether, we show that unlike known oncogenic variants, F636del identified in the first case of trisomy 21-independent TAM attenuates JAK1 kinase activity. The results of our phenotypic studies question the potential contribution of this mutation to TAM development. Interestingly, Labuhn et al. (2019) recently showed that non-activating JAK mutations occur at higher than random frequency in trisomy 21-dependent TAM. This tempts us to speculate that JAK1 mutations may still play a role in TAM. Yet, this role may significantly differ from that of known oncogenic mutations; it may result from attenuation/modulation instead of activation of downstream signaling and it may remain unrevealed utilizing the currently available sophisticated, yet still imperfect experimental models.
