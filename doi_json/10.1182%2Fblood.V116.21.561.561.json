    "abstract_text": "Abstract 561 Background: Mantle cell lymphoma and indolent B cell lymphomas are incurable with chemotherapy but are susceptible to the T cell-mediated graft-versus-lymphoma effect of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, HCT is associated with high treatment-related morbidity and mortality, and furthermore, many patients are not eligible due to age, comorbidities, and lack of a suitable donor. We have therefore pursued a novel immunotherapy for lymphoma using adoptive transfer of autologous patient-derived T lymphocytes genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific for the CD20 antigen, a well-established immunotherapy target expressed on B-cell lymphomas. We conducted a previous clinical trial that demonstrated this approach was safe and feasible, but revealed several areas needing improvement, including modest in vivo persistence of transferred cells and limited anti-lymphoma effect. We have attempted to address these shortcomings in the current follow-up trial. Methods: In this pilot phase I protocol, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from consenting subjects by apheresis, activated with OKT3 and IL-2, and electroporated on day 4\u20135 with a plasmid containing an SP163 translational enhancer and a NeoR gene and encoding a CAR consisting of a mouse anti-human CD20 scFv (Leu16), an IgG1 spacer, and CD4 transmembrane, intracellular CD28 and CD137 (4-1BB) costimulatory and CD3\u03b6 signaling domains. Transfected cells were selected with G418 and expanded ex vivo by restimulation every 12\u201314 days using a rapid expansion protocol. Patients were lymphodepleted with 1000 mg/m 2 cyclophosphamide (CY) two days prior to the first T cell infusion, and then received 3 infusions 2\u20135 days apart of 10 8 , 10 9 , and 3.3 \u00d7 10 9 cells/m 2 , followed by 14 days of low-dose IL-2 injections (250,000 U/m 2 s.c. twice daily). Results: Four patients have been enrolled to date, and three patients received a total of 9 T cell infusions. The fourth patient, whose cells did not expand to the target level, opted to withdraw from the study rather than receive a reduced number of cells. Modified cells had an activated effector T cell phenotype (CD3 + /CD45RA low /CD45RO + /CD25 + /CD27 - /CD28 - ) and demonstrated in vitro cytotoxicity against CD20 + target cells. Toxicities related to T cell infusions occurred in 1 patient: grade 2 fever and orthostatic hypotension, and grade 3 hypoxia, which all resolved after overnight observation. Other toxicities were associated with CY and IL-2, and were mild and predictable. Modified T cells were detectable by PCR in lymph nodes and bone marrow in all treated patients, and persisted in peripheral blood for up to 5 months. Clinical responses to CY + T cell infusions + IL-2 included a complete remission in 1 patient lasting 10 months thus far, no evaluable disease in a second patient, who is progression-free after 7 months, and stable disease with a partial PET response lasting 3 months thus far in the third patient. Intermediate-dose CY resulted in significant depletion of circulating CD3 + T cells, including CD4 + /FoxP3 + regulatory T cells, and CD20 + B cells in all patients, and led to increased IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 levels in 1 patient. Conclusions: These results suggest that infusion of CD20-specific T cells expressing a CAR containing costimulatory domains is well-tolerated, and lymphodepletion with CY and inclusion of costimulatory domains in the CAR leads to improved T cell persistence and possibly enhanced anti-lymphoma activity compared with \u201cfirst generation\u201d CARs.
