    "abstract_text": "Background: BCMA targeted immunotherapy has yielded promising results for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). TNB-383B is a BCMA x CD3 bispecific T-cell redirecting antibody incorporating a unique anti-CD3 moiety that preferentially activates effector over regulatory T-cells and uncouples cytokine release from anti-tumor activity, as well as 2 heavy-chain-only anti-BCMA moieties for a 2:1 tumor associated antigen to CD3 stoichiometry. Results from the ongoing phase 1 dose escalation and expansion First-in-Human (FIH) study of TNB-383B are presented (NCT03933735). Methods: Eligible patients have RRMM and have been exposed to at least 3 prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Patients have been treated with escalating doses of TNB-383B infused IV over 1-2 hours Q3W (without step-up dosing). The primary objectives are to determine the safety/tolerability and clinical pharmacology of TNB-383B and to identify the MTD/RP2D. The study used a 3+3 design for dose escalation, with additional patients enrolled on cleared dose levels. Patients on earlier dose cohorts were allowed to increase to the highest cleared dose with investigator consensus. Responses were assessed by IMWG criteria and Adverse Events (AEs) were graded according to CTCAE v5.0. Minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment was performed via NGS on bone marrow samples in patients achieving a complete response (CR). Results: As of 13 July 2020, 38 subjects have been dosed with TNB-383B (0.025 - 40 mg). Demographics and disease characteristics at study entry are summarized in Table 1. The most common Gr 3/4 AEs were anemia (6/38; 16%) and thrombocytopenia (5/38; 13%). The most common drug-related AEs were CRS (8/38; 21%) and headache (5/38; 13%). One case of Gr 2 CRS was observed at 0.075 mg; all other CRS events were seen at 5.4 mg and above. Cases of CRS were grade 1 (5/8) or 2 (3/8) and occurred only after the first dose of TNB-383B. All but 3 subjects were managed with fluids and acetaminophen (the other 3 received 1 dose each of tocilizumab). One DLT, Gr3 confusion that resolved within 6 hours without sequelae was seen at the 20 mg dose in an additional patient enrolled on this cohort. No IRRs were observed. Dose modification was necessary in 1 subject for Gr 3 neutropenia associated with CRS; the subject escalated to their full dose after tolerating subsequent doses without incident. 5 subjects died from their underlying disease during follow-up. 15 subjects discontinued treatment, all of them for progressive disease. Preliminary PK data support Q3W dosing of TNB-383B. Activity was observed in one patient each at 0.2 mg and 1.8 mg; at doses of 5.4 - 40 mg an ORR of 52% (12/23) was observed. Depth and duration of response are summarized in Table 2. Conclusions: TNB-383B is well tolerated at doses up to 40 mg, without the need for step/split dosing. A preliminary ORR of 52% (12/23) was observed at doses \u2265 5.4 mg, including deep (6 PR / 3 VGPR / 3 CR) and durable (up to 24 weeks) responses despite dosing only every 3 weeks. Enrollment into the dose escalation arm is ongoing; updated data will be presented at the meeting.
