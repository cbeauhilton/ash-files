    "abstract_text": "Abstract 281 Background: PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2A induces complete hematologic response (CHR) in 76% and 80% of pts with advanced polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocythemia (ET), respectively, which is accompanied by a reduction of at least 50% in the JAK2 V617F mutant allele burden in 52% of pts with PV (undetectable in 18%) and in 29% of those with ET (undetectable in 18%). These data suggest selective targeting of JAK2 V617F \u2013positive clones. The impact of PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2A on other mutations frequently found in patients with PV or ET is unknown. Objectives: To investigate the dynamics of mutant JAK2 , TET2 , MPL , ASXL1 DNMT3a , EZH2 , and IDH1/2 alleles in 71 pts with high-risk PV or ET treated with PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2A in a phase II study. Patients and Methods: We performed high-throughput mutational analysis of the regions of known mutations in JAK2, MPL , IDH1 , IDH2 , and all coding regions of TET2 , ASXL1, EZH2, and DNMT3a in pretreatment samples from 71 patients from this trial and in 21 of them obtained serially during treatment or post-treatment. We then analyzed the mutational data to determine (a) distribution of mutations amongst response groups and (b) whether genetic aberrations in addition to the JAK2 mutational burden pre- or post-treatment correlated with response to therapy. Results: 71 pts were analyzed: 12 good responders (at least partial molecular response [\u226550% reduction in JAK2 V617F allele burden]), 50 intermediate responders (only complete hematologic response), and 9 worst responders (no response or only a partial hematologic response). Median age was 50 years (range, 18\u201379), time from diagnosis to PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2a 51 months (range, 0\u2013355), and number of prior therapies was 1 (range, 0\u20136). The median JAK2 V617F allele burden at study entry was 20% (range, 4.8%-93.6%). The median follow-up was 40 months (range, 8\u201362). Mutations were found in the following genes in patients from this cohort as follows (using mutations found at any point in treatment): 39.4% JAK2 , 14.1% TET2, 14.1% DNMT3a , 5.6% ASXL1, 1.4% EZH2, 1.4% IDH2 . No significant differences were observed regarding the number of mutations in genes other than JAK2 between the worst responders and the best responders. The mutational frequency according to response to PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2A is shown in Table 1 .The proportion of patients carrying 2 or more mutations was 8.3% among the good responders, 0% among the intermediate, and 11.1% among the worst responders. Samples during PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2a therapy were obtained in 21 pts (13 good, 4 intermediate, and 4 worst responders). Of note, 50% of the best responders and 22.2% of the worst responders had a mutation in addition to JAK2 prior to starting PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2a therapy. Interestingly, high-throughput sequencing done in sequential samples from 11/12 best responders and in 8/9 worst responders revealed that 16.7% of the former and 44.4% of the latter had acquired a new mutation in a gene other than JAK2 during therapy (p=0.04). High-throughput sequencing of individual clones retrieved from clonogenic cultures of bone marrow samples obtained during PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2a therapy will be presented. Table 1.

The fact that more patients in the worst responder group acquired mutations during therapy compared with the best responder group, may reflect either a possible effect of additional mutations on resistance to therapy, or it may be a consequence of genetic evolution of the malignant clone resistant to PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2a-induced eradication in the worst responders.
