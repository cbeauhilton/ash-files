    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2787 Background Subcutaneous omacetaxine mepesuccinate (\u201comacetaxine\u201d) is an investigational, first-in-class cephalotaxine, a protein synthesis inhibitor that does not depend on direct binding of Bcr-Abl. Omacetaxine reduces levels of multiple oncoproteins, including Bcr-Abl, and induces apoptosis in leukemic stem cells. It has shown clinical activity and adequate tolerability in two phase 2, open-label studies of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the first in patients with a history of the T315I Bcr-Abl mutation (enrolled September 2006 through March 2010) and the second in patients with resistance or intolerance to \u22652 approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; enrolled March 2007 through June 2009). This ad hoc analysis presents the efficacy and safety results of patients in the phase 2 studies who remained on omacetaxine as of March 31, 2012. Methods Efficacy and safety data were pooled from patients with CML chronic phase (CML-CP) and CML accelerated phase (CML-AP) who received omacetaxine in either of the phase 2 studies and had not discontinued omacetaxine as of March 31, 2012. Omacetaxine 1.25 mg/m 2 was given subcutaneously twice daily up to 14 consecutive days per 28-day cycle for induction and at the same dosage for up to 7 days/cycle as maintenance. Results Of the 203 patients enrolled in the 2 studies (108 CML-CP, 51 CML-AP, and 44 CML blast phase), 9 CML-CP patients (median 35 cycles [range 26\u201353]) and 2 CML-AP patients (median 20.5 cycles [range 19\u201322]) continue to receive omacetaxine. Median age of ongoing CML-CP patients at baseline was 61 years (range 45\u201373); 7 were male. Median age of ongoing CML-AP patients was 58 years (range 48\u201367); all were male. For CML-CP patients, the median number of dosing days was 137 (range 68\u2013342) over a median of 35 cycles (range 26\u201353); the 2 CML-AP patients had 189 and 277 dosing days during 19 and 22 cycles, respectively. Other baseline clinical characteristics are presented in the Table. Seven of the CML-CP patients achieved MCyR, including 6 complete responses. One CML-CP patient achieved a minimal cytogenetic response and 1 had no response. No CML-AP patient achieved MCyR. Time to onset of MCyR for the CML-CP patients were <3 months (n=2), 3 to <6 months (n=2), and 6 to <12 months (n=3). In the 7 patients with MCyR, duration of response to date is \u22656 to <12 (n=3), \u226512 to <18 (n=2), and \u226518 months (n=2); none lost response. Six CML-CP patients were in CHR at baseline and 3 achieved CHR within 3 months. One CML-AP patient achieved CHR at <3 months and 1 only had hematologic improvement. Eight of the 9 CML-CP patients and 1 CML-AP patient remained in CHR at time of analysis, whereas 1 CML-CP patient lost response in \u22656 to <12 months (patient had minimal cytogenetic response). At the last recorded cycle, the number of dosing days for CML-CP patients ranged from 1\u201312 days and 7\u201315 days in CML-AP patients; number of days of treatment delay ranged from 0\u20134 days in CML-CP patients and 0\u201333 days in the 2 CML-AP patients. All patients had at least 1 AE and 1 serious AE. The most common AEs were anemia (11/11), thrombocytopenia (9/11), neutropenia (6/11), nausea (7/11), diarrhea or fatigue (5/11 each), and headache (4/11). Grade 3/4 AEs occurred in 10 (91%) patients. The most common were hematologic: thrombocytopenia (79% \\(79\\) CML-CP, 100% \\(22\\) CML-AP), anemia (67% \\(49\\) CML-CP, 100% \\(22\\) CML-AP), and neutropenia (56% \\(59\\) CML-CP, 0% \\(02\\) CML-AP). Leukopenia and pancytopenia were reported in 1 patient each in the CML-AP group. Blast crisis, which was deemed treatment-related, was reported in 1 patient in the CML-AP group; this patient was discontinued. No deaths were reported. Conclusions A subset of heavily pretreated patients with CP or AP CML who participated in phase 2 studies of omacetaxine were able to continue omacetaxine for up to 53 cycles and experience durable major cytogenetic and hematologic responses. Grade 3/4 AEs were primarily hematologic and consistent with the known safety profile of omacetaxine. Table. Baseline Clinical Characteristics  Clinical Characteristic . CML-CP (n=9) . CML-AP (n=2) .
