    "abstract_text": "Backgroud: To evaluate the efficacy of preemptive therapy for preventing EBV related PTLD based on the duration of EBV-emia and the viral loads in the patients undergoing haplo-HSCT, a prospective multicenter study was conducted. Methods: Rituximab or rituximab followed by adoptive cellular therapy was applied for preemptive therapy if EBV-DNA in blood was positive twice consecutively with a rising trend over one log in virus loads or positive consecutively six times without a dropping trend over one log at least within three weeks or not turning negative consecutively eight times within four weeks. Results : Of the 408 patients with acute leukemia enrolled in this study, 133 occurred EBV-emia, including 19 PTLD and 6 end-organ diseases. The patients with EBV-emia had inferior three-year overall survival (OS) and higher non-relapse mortality (NRM) to those without EBV-emia (OS: 58.0%\u00b15.0% vs. 71.0%\u00b13.0%, =0.042; NRM: 27.9%\u00b13.9% vs. 18.9%\u00b12.4%, =0.050, respectively). Compared with non-preemptive group, the negative conversion of EBV-emia was significantly higher (100% vs. 76.1%, =0.002) and the three-year incidence of PTLD was markedly lower in preemptive group (1.3% vs. 21.7%, =0.000). The median time from EBV-emia to EBV diseases onset was 15 days and the durative time of EBV-emia was positively correlated with PTLD occurrence (=0.419, =0.024). Conclusion s : Rituximab preemptive therapy could reduce the incidence of PTLD. Earlier preemptive therapy should be advocated once the EBV-emia is positive persistently regardless of EBV-DNA levels (NCT01883180). Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
