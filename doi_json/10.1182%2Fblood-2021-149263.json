    "abstract_text": "CAR T cell therapy provides a potent therapeutic option in various B cell-related hematologic malignancies. One of the major efficacy challenges is escape of tumor cells with low antigen density, which has been clinically observed in several malignancies treated with CAR therapy. Novel concepts of CAR design are needed to address phenotypic heterogeneity including clonal variability of target antigen expression. In the study presented here, we focused on AML and selected ADGRE2 as CAR target due to its high rate of positivity on AML bulk and leukemic stem cells (LSC) in a molecularly heterogeneous AML patient population. We chose an ADGRE2-CAR with optimized scFv affinity and fine-tuned CD3zeta signaling to achieve an ideal killing threshold that would allow for sparing of ADGRE2-low normal cells. We hypothesized that co-targeting of a second AML-related antigen may mitigate potential CAR target antigen-low AML escape and we identified CLEC12A as preferential co-target due to its non-overlapping expression profiles in normal hematopoiesis and other vital tissues. We developed ADCLEC.syn1, a novel combinatorial CAR construct consisting of an ADGRE2-targeting 28z1XX-CAR and a CLEC12A-targeting chimeric costimulatory receptor (CCR). ADCLEC.syn1 operates based on what we describe as \"IF-BETTER\" gate: High CAR target expression alone triggers killing, whereas low CAR target expression does not, unless a CCR target is present. Additional CCR interaction lowers the threshold for CAR-mediated killing through increased avidity and costimulation, allowing for higher CAR sensitivity that is purposefully limited to target cells expressing both antigens. In the context of ADCLEC.syn1, ADGRE2-high/CLEC12A-negative AML cells can trigger cell lysis while ADGRE2-low/CLEC12A-negative normal cells are spared. Importantly, ADGRE2-low/CLEC12A-high AML cells are also potently eliminated, preventing ADGRE2-low AML escape. Using NSG in-vivo xenograft models of engineered MOLM13 AML cell line variants with low levels of ADGRE2 to model antigen escape, we found that ADCLEC.syn1 outperforms a single-ADGRE2-CAR lacking assistance via CLEC12A-CCR. Importantly, ADCLEC.syn1 also outperformed an otherwise identical alternative dual-CAR version (OR-gated ADGRE2-CAR+CLEC12A-CAR) in the setting of both ADGRE2-high and ADGRE2-low MOLM13, further underlining the importance of fine-tuned overall signaling. We confirmed high in-vivo potency against diverse AML cell lines with a wide range of ADGRE2 and CLEC12A levels reflecting population-wide AML heterogeneity. At clinically relevant CAR T cell doses, ADCLEC.syn1 induced complete and durable remissions in xenograft models of MOLM13 (ADGRE2-high/CLEC12A-low) and U937 (ADGRE2-low/CLEC12A-high). ADCLEC.syn1 CAR T cells were found to be functionally persistent for >70 days, with a single CAR T cell dose potently averting relapse modeled via AML re-challenges. In summary, we provide pre-clinical evidence that an \"IF-BETTER\"-gated CAR+CCR T cell (ADCLEC.syn1) can outperform a single-CAR T cell (ADGRE2-CAR) and a dual-CAR T cell (ADGRE2-CAR+CLEC12A-CAR). ADCLEC.syn1 enhances antileukemic efficacy and prevents antigen-low AML escape via detection of a rationally selected combinatorial target antigen signature that is commonly found in AML but limited in vital normal cells. Using phenotypically representative AML xenograft models and clinically relevant T cell doses, we demonstrate high therapeutic potential of ADCLEC.syn1 CAR T cells, further supporting clinical translation of an \"IF-BETTER\"-gated CAR concept into a phase 1 trial.
