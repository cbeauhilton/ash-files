    "abstract_text": "A high proportion of Ph-positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Ph+ ALL) patients still undergo relapses despite the use of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) in addition to chemotherapy as frontline therapy. In this leukemia subtype, the role of BCR-ABL1 kinase domain (KD) mutations as a driver of resistance to TKIs has already been documented by previous studies and such mutations have been reported in up to 80% of the patients at relapse. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been proposed to characterize these mutations with a higher sensitivity than Sanger. We report here a prospective study aiming at detecting potentially resistant cell populations by NGS in Ph+ ALL patients enrolled in the GRAAPH 2014-trial. Between March 2016 and February 2019, 156 patients aged 18 to 59 years with newly diagnosed Ph+ and/or BCR-ABL1 positive ALL have been included in the GRAAPH 2014 trial (NCT02619630). BCR-ABL1 isoforms were E1A2 69%, B2A2/B3A2 29%, atypical 2%. After a prephase of steroid, treatment consisted of 4 blocks of chemotherapy + nilotinib. 118 patients (76%) underwent allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). 22 medullary relapses were recorded within a median time of 9 months (range, 2 - 35). Blood and marrow samples harvested at diagnosis, after each treatment block, before and 3 months after SCT, and at relapse, were sequenced if BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratio were above 0.001. Mutated BCR-ABL1 transcripts were detected by sequencing the KD of BCR-ABL1 transcripts by NGS with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.03. T315I allele specific oligonucleotide (ASO) droplet digital RT-PCR (ddRT-PCR) with a LOD of 0.0005 was also performed at diagnosis on a subset of 63 patients, including 5 who have subsequently developed a T315I clone. NGS. At diagnosis, no KD mutation was found by NGS in pretreatment samples of 137 patients. During follow-up (FU), only 12 mutations were found by NGS in 7 out of the 88 patients tested (81, 45, 30, 20, 19, 9 after block 1, 2, 3, 4, before and 3 months after SCT, respectively). Mutations were T315I (N=6), Y253H (N=1), E255K (N=2), E255V (N=1), Q252H (N=1), Y253F (N=1). At relapse, 16 mutations were identified by NGS in 12 patients out of the 17 tested (71%). Mutations were T315I (N=7), Y253H (N=n=3), F359V (N=2), E255K (N=1), E255V (N=1), Q252H (N=1), Y253F (N=1). More than 1 mutated clone were present in 2 patients (E255V+T315I+F359V and Y253H+F359V), and a compound mutation was found in 1 patient (Q252H/Y253F). Out of the 7 patients found mutated during FU, 5 have relapsed with a rapid expansion (1 to 3 months) of the mutated clone. One patient harboring a sub-clonal (10%) E255K at MRD1 has relapsed 9 months later without any detectable mutation. One patient identified with 3 mutated clones (E255K 10%, E255V 10%, T315I 80%) underwent SCT and has not relapsed so far. We failed to anticipate expansion of any mutated clone in the 7 remaining patients found mutated at relapse. T315I ASO ddRT-PCR on diagnostic samples. Low-level T315I mutated BCR-ABL1 transcripts (0.00051 to 0.0013) were detected in 14 out of 63 patients (24%) tested. Only one has expanded a T315I clone later on. In the context of the GRAAPH 2014 trial, 71% of the 17 relapses tested so far were associated with BCR-ABL1 KD mutations. Expansion of the mutated clone could have been characterized before the onset of hematological relapses in only 5 out of 12 patients (42%). Unfortunately in these cases, lags between first detection and relapse were very short (1 to 3 months). On the contrary, occurrences of relapses associated with expansion of KD-mutated clones could not have been anticipated in 58%. All mutations identified, including T315I, F359V, E255K/V and Y253F/H, Q252H/Y253F are known for conferring resistance to nilotinib. NGS is a valuable method for KD mutation detection in Ph+ ALL. It allows a quantitative characterization of KD mutations at relapse. However in our hands and in the context of an intensive therapy combining chemotherapy, nilotinib and SCT, its enhanced sensitivity as compared to Sanger (3% vs 20%) does not translate into the capacity of anticipating expansion of KD-mutated clones. Moreover, in this study, NGS did not detect any mutation in pre-therapeutic samples while T315I mutated BCR-ABL1 transcripts were found at low-level in 24% of these samples by ddRT-PCR. However it should be emphasized that when detected, low-level T315I mutated sub-clones present at diagnosis failed to expand in most instances.
