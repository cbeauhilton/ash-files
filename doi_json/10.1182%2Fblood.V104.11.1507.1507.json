    "abstract_text": "Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is an infrequent hematological disorder characterized by persistent eosinophilia with organ involvement, often presenting to other medical specialists. We studied 89 primary HES defined as a peripheral blood eosinophilia greater than 1,500 cells/\u03bcL for longer than 6 months, absence of other apparent aetiologies for eosinophilia and symptoms of organ involvement. All patients were negative by molecular analysis for TEL-PDGFRB, and/or BCR-ABL transcripts, frequently associated with HES/CMML/MDS syndromes. We also sought for the recently reported involvement of PDGFRalpha, cryptically fused with FIP1L1 in some HES patients responsive to Imatinib therapy: 34 patients were positive for the FIP1L1-PDGFRA rearrangement and all of them showed previously unreported, abnormal-sized fusion transcripts. A specific RT-PCR assay has been set up for this analysis and a quantitative Q-RT-PCR Taqman assay is in development. Of note, all FIP1L1-PDGFRA positive patients were male. 56 out of 89 (62%) primary HES patients, including 31/34 FIP1L1-PDGFRA positive, were sensitive to imatinib mesylate (100 to 400 mg/daily). Median follow up of treatment was 10 months (range 2\u201328). Rapid and complete haematological responses (CHR) to imatinib therapy were recorded in all FIP1L1-PDGFRA positive patients (91%) after one month of therapy and partial response in nine cases with HES but without FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion transcript. Complete molecular response without evidence of FIP1L1-PDGFRA transcript by qualitative RT-PCR was also recorded in the majority of responding patients after median 2 months of therapy, however in few cases the complete molecular response could be recognised only after more than 18 months of imatinib therapy. We conclude that FIP1L1-PDGFRA rearrangement is a useful molecular marker of myeloproliferative HES, a predictor of imatinib-responsiveness and as a means to follow therapy in this subgroup of patients.",
