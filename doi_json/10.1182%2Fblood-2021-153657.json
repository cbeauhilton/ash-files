    "abstract_text": "Background : In MDS, hypomethylating agents (HMA) remain the standard of care. ASTX727, an oral formulation of the fixed dose combination of the HMA decitabine and cytidine deaminase inhibitor cedazuridine, was recently approved for the treatment of MDS and CMML. Venetoclax (Ven), an orally bioavailable BCL-2 inhibitor in combination with azacitidine has shown clinical activity in treatment-na\u00efve higher risk MDS. Based on this data, we designed a total oral therapy with Ven+ASTX727 combination to improve the clinical outcomes and quality of life in pts with higher risk MDS or CMML. Methods: This single arm Phase I/II study of orally administered ASTX727 in combination with Ven (NCT04655755) is enrolling pts aged \u226518 years with treatment\u2010na\u00efve higher risk MDS (intermediate-2 or high) per IPSS or CMML with excess blasts \u22655%. Prior bcl2 inhibitor therapy is not allowed. To mitigate tumor lysis syndrome, pretreatment white blood cell count should be less than 10 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Cytoreduction is allowed. The phase I 3+3 design of venetoclax with ASTX727 has an intended sample size of 12 pts. ASTX727 (cedazuridine/decitabine at 100 mg/35 mg) is administered orally daily on days 1\u20105 of each treatment cycle and Ven on days 1\u201014 of the first cycle and thereafter. Three dose levels of venetoclax in combination with ASTX727 will be tested (Table 1) The safety population includes all patients who received any dose of Ven+ ASTX727, and the efficacy population includes patients who have a valid baseline and post-baseline disease assessment and had received at least one dose of the study drug. The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability (phase 1) and overall response rate (ORR) (phase 2) of Ven+ASTX727 combination. Results: In phase I portion, seven pts have been enrolled to date (Table 2). The median age is 72 years (range, 54-84) with five pts aged \u226565 yrs. These pts had a median bone marrow blast count of 13% (range,6-15), and harbored a median number of 4 (range,1-7) mutations. Greater than 50% of the cohort harbored adverse risk mutations such as ASXL1 (71%), RUNX1 (57%). Three pts were enrolled in dose level 0 and four pts in dose level +1. No DLTs were observed in the initial 6 pt safety lead-in. The 30-day and 60-day mortality rates were 0% each. No tumor lysis syndrome was observed. All seven pts achieved a response (100%) with three pts achieving CR (43%) and four pts achieving marrow CR (57%). Among the responders, two pts achieved MRD negativity (29%). All pts achieved a response within 1 cycle. One pt with TP53 mut proceeded to hematopoietic stem cell transplant at the end of 2 cycles and the remaining six pts continue on study. At a median follow up of 3.8 months, the median duration of response was not reached (range,1.8-5.1+ months), and the median overall survival was not reached (range,2.7-6.2+ months). Conclusion: Ven+ASTX727 combination appears safe and demonstrates preliminary efficacy in pts with higher risk MDS or CMML with excess blasts. Total oral therapy of Ven+ASTX727 combination appears to be a promising strategy for HR MDS or CMML pts who often require long term treatment.
