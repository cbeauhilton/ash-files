    "abstract_text": "Purpose To determine the characteristics of Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) patients with concomitant systemic and central nervous system localization at diagnosis, as well as the impact of consolidation with high dose chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell rescue on outcome Patients and Methods Newly diagnosed NHL patients with concomitant systemic and cerebral or meningeal involvement at diagnosis have been included in this study. Patients were retrieved from the database of the participating centers of the LYSA and LOC study groups Results Sixty-five patients (37 males; 28 females) were included. Median age was 60 years (23-85). Histological subtype was mainly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n=54; 83%). The IPI was >2 in 43 (66%) patients. LDH level was elevated in 27 (55%) patients. Median number of extranodal positive sites was 2 (1-5) and bone marrow involvement was documented in 30 (46%) patients. CNS involvement was documented in 51 patients. Paravertebral and epidural compressive mass with (n=5) or without (n=2) CSF involvement were present. Five patients had both CNS and peripheral nervous system involvement. Anthracycline-based chemotherapy with high dose metothrexate with or without cytarabine was the most chemotherapy used. Autologous stem cell transplantation was performed in 21 patients in response. BEAM (n=9) or thiotepa-based (n=9) conditioning regimen was the most intensive chemotherapy used before autologous SCT Post-chemotherapy ORR was 77%(CR69%;PR8%). 3-year overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were 48\u00b17% and 46\u00b17% respectively. The consolidation strategy using high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant positively impacted patient\u2019s outcome. For the whole group as well as for patients \u226465 years, the 3-year OS and PFS were (77%vs29%;p=0.002) and (77%vs25%;p=0.001) and (75% vs 37%;p=0.002) and (75%vs32%;p=0.007) respectively. In multivariate analysis and for the whole group of patients, the absence high dose therapy had a negative impact on 3-year OS and PFS [p=0.003;HR=5.05[1.76-14.49]) and PFS by [p=0.002;HR=5.46(1.91-15.26)] respectively. This is remained true for younger patients 65 years or less who had poorer 3-year OS [p=0.036;HR=3.41 (1.08-10.75)]. Conclusion First line consolidative high dose therapy followed by autologous SCT in patients with systemic and neuro-meningeal NHL improve patient\u2019s outcome Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
