    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4404 Cancer cells almost invariably exhibit aberrant histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity leading to changes in chromatine structure, altered gene expression, poor differentiation, impaired apoptosis and increased proliferation. Accordingly, virtually all the HDAC inhibitors currently available show some degree of antitumor activity in preclinical cancer models and several of these compounds are currently under investigation or already approved for the treatment of human malignancies. Such is the case of the hydroxamic acid derivative suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (Vorinostat, Zolinza), approved for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphomas. Sirtuins are a large family of deacetylases characterized by a unique, NAD + -dependent enzymatic mechanism. In addition to their established role in metabolism and longevity, recent evidence points to an emerging role for sirtuins in carcinogenesis. In the attempt to identify drug combinations that would increase the activity of traditional HDAC inhibitors we have explored the combination of valproic acid (VA) and butyrate (BU) with the sirtuin inhibitors cambinol and sirtinol in primary B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells (n=35), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells (n=10) and leukemia cell lines. Cell viability was assessed by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Combination indices were determined using the median-effect method. In leukemia cells, exposure to sirtuin inhibitors synergistically increased VA and BU mediated cytotoxicity. Conversely, these drugs were poorly active and failed to show any cooperation in healthy cells, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells and fibroblasts, suggesting a cancer-specific mode of action. Similar results were obtained by combining VA or BU with the Nampt inhibitor APO866, which reduces intracellular NAD + levels and thereby prevents sirtuin activity. Remarkably, SIRT1 and SIRT6 inhibition per se did not seem to account for cell demise upon HDAC inhibition since expression of a dominant negative SIRT1 isoform or RNA interference-mediated SIRT6 silencing failed to increase VA and BU activity. Our data indicate a specific requirement by leukemia cells for sustained sirtuin activity when classical HDACs are inhibited. This feature is suitable to be therapeutically exploited by combining sirtuin inhibitors or APO866 with classical HDAC inhibitors especially for the treatment of hematological malignancies.
