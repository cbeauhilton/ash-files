    "abstract_text": "Sporadic cases of successful non-T-cell-depleted (TCD) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) from HLA-haploidentical family members mismatched for noninherited maternal antigens (NIMAs) have been reported over the last few years. This kind of SCT is based on the hypothesis that long-term feto-maternal microchimerism is associated with acquired immunologic hyporesponsiveness to NIMA or inherited paternal antigens (IPAs). To confirm the effectiveness and safety of NIMA-mismatched SCT in a large cohort, we retrospectively surveyed the outcomes of 76 children (44 boys, 32 girls; median age 7 years, range, 0\u201318) with either advanced non-malignant disorders (n=10), hematological malignancies (n=62) or solid tumors (n=4) who underwent T-cell-replete HLA-2-loci- or HLA-3-loci incompatible SCT from NIMA-mismatched donors (mother, n=53; NIMA-mismatched sibling, n=12) or other family donors (father/NIPA-mismatched sibling) (n=11) between 01/2000 and 12/2004. Disease status of malignant disease at SCT was as follows: CR1/CR2/CP in 19 and chemorefractory in 47. Types of grafts were bone marrow in 40 and peripheral blood stem cells in 35. Feto-maternal michrochimerism was detected in 32 out of 35 mothers tested and 8 out of 8 NIMA-mismatched sibling donors. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus-based regimen in 73. All but two patients achieved sustained neutrophil engraftment at median of 16.5 days (range, 10\u201329). Grade II to IV acute GVHD occurred in 36 of 73 evaluable patients (49%) between days 7 and 36 (median, 17). In non-malignant disorders, no severe (grade III/IV) acute GVHD was observed, while in malignant disorders, severe acute GVHD occurred in 21 (32%) of 65 evaluable patients. Twenty-two out of 41 evaluable patients (54%) who survived more than 6 months had extensive chronic GVHD. As of 04/2005, in non-malignant disorders, all 9 patients who obtained engraftment were alive. In malignant disorders, twenty-nine out of 66 patients (44%) were alive and 25 of them were disease-free with median follow-up of 25 (range, 4 to 57) months. Death were due to disease progression (n=22), infection (n=6), GVHD (n=4) and others (n=4). These results suggest that pediatric patients who lack immediate access to a conventional stem cell source can obtain successful results with non-TCD transplants from an HLA-haploidentical NIMA-mismatched donor.",
