    "abstract_text": "Although nucleoside analogues have been used effectively in the clinic for the treatment of a wide range of hematological malignancies, lack of response to currently available nucleoside analogues and drug resistance limit their utility. A rare but highly aggressive cancer is primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). Through high throughput screening, we have discovered a novel nucleoside analog, called 6-ethylthioinosine (6-ETI) as a potent and selective inhibitor of PEL, with little activity in other lymphomas tested. PEL is a rare B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma characterized by lymphomatous effusions in body cavities. It is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV-8) infection and occurs mainly in immunocompromised patients. PEL is known to frequently be resistant to conventional chemotherapy (CHOP and EPOCH) resulting in poor prognosis and a rather incurable disease. Our studies demonstrated that 6-ETI is a pro-drug activated by adenosine kinase (ADK), an enzyme that is overexpressed in PEL cell lines and primary PEL specimens, as well as other plasma cell malignancies, including plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) and multiple myeloma (MM). The latter is also responsive to 6-ETI in vitro and in mouse models. 6-ETI induces S phase arrest and inhibits DNA synthesis. RNA sequencing of in vitro generated PEL resistant clones and CRISPR knock out of ADK (ADK KO), respectively, indicated that mutations or loss of expression of ADK renders cells resistant to treatment. This data demonstrates that ADK expression can be used as a predictive biomarker of response to 6-ETI, which can help identify which patients are more likely to respond to this treatment. We investigated which pathways are differentially regulated in sensitive and resistant cells to better delineate the mechanism of action of 6-ETI and to design effective combinatorial regimens and prevent resistance. We found that drug sensitivity was associated with AMPK activation and inhibition of PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K signaling. Little is known about the function of ADK in plasma cell neoplasms. Knock-out of this protein in PEL, or use of ADK chemical inhibitors, do not affect their viability. Thus, we used ADK KO cell lines to examine the role of ADK in these tumors and to determine if cells undergo adaptations that may contribute to 6-ETI resistance and represent potential vulnerabilities to combat it. We performed metabolic and transcriptomic profiling of wild type (WT) (6-ETI sensitive) and ADK KO (6-ETI resistant) cells to achieve a comprehensive assessment of all the metabolic perturbations and gene expression changes induced by knocking out ADK. We also treated these cells with 6-ETI to examine the effects in sensitive and resistant cells. This integrated analysis revealed that 6-ETI depletes sensitive PEL cells of their nucleotide pools accompanied by the downregulation of several genes in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis pathways. We found that adenine supplementation rescues sensitive PEL cells from 6-ETI induced cytotoxicity, reverses p70S6K inhibition and restores DNA synthesis suggesting that purine metabolism is a critical mediator of 6-ETI induced cytotoxicity. Using seahorse bioenergetic assay, we show that ADK KO resistant cells have impaired mitochondrial respiration indicating that ADK plays a critical role in mitochondrial bioenergetics. Metabolic profiling of these ADK KO resistant cells showed that these cells have elevated levels of de novo pyrimidine metabolic intermediates. Metabolic flux through de novo pyrimidine is controlled by the rate limiting enzyme CAD. The activity of CAD is regulated by ribosomal protein S6 Kinase 1(S6K1) by phosphorylation at its (Ser1859) site. Using western blotting, we observed a striking increase of phosphorylation of CAD at its S6K1 site (Ser1859) in ADK KO cells compared to WT cells. This is the first to date study that characterizes the role of ADK in lymphomas. Our data indicates that ADK KO cells have undergone metabolic reprogramming to upregulate de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis and p70S6K signaling. Moreover, we found that 6-ETI synergizes with the pan PI3K inhibitor BKM120 highlighting nucleotide metabolism and PI3K/mTOR signaling as key therapeutic vulnerabilities targeted by this novel nucleoside analog.
