    "abstract_text": "There have been significant advances in the treatment of patients with B-NHL using combination of rituximab and CHOP. However, a subset of patients does not initially respond or develop resistance to further treatments; hence, the need for alternative therapies to overcome resistance. TRAIL and agonist DR4/DR5 monoclonal antibodies have been examined clinically against a variety of tumors in Phase I/II. However, the majority of B-NHL derived from patients and cell lines are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Recent findings demonstrated that treatment of TRAIL-resistant-B-NHL with rituximab sensitizes the tumor cells to TRAIL apoptosis. The underlying mechanism of rituximab-induced sensitization to TRAIL, however, is not clear. We have recently reported that treatment of tumor cells with sensitizing agents (example CDDP, proteasome inhibitors) resulted in the reversal of resistance to TRAIL via induction of Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) and demonstrated the pivotal role of RKIP in the regulation of tumor cell sensitivity to TRAIL. Hence, since rituximab induces the expression of RKIP in B-NHL, we determined the role of RKIP induction by rituximab in the sensitization of B-NHL to TRAIL apoptosis. Various B-NHL cell lines were used as models for study. Treatment of B-NHL cells with rituximab (20 ng/ml) and TRAIL (5\u201310 ng/ml) resulted in significant potentiation of apoptosis and synergy was achieved. Rituximab induced the expression of RKIP as determined by RT-PCR and western concomitantly with inhibition of NF-kB. The inhibition of NF-kB resulted in upregulation of RKIP expression and was mediated, in large part, by inhibition of the transcription repressor Snail (downstream of NF-kB). Further, RKIP-induced inhibition of NF-kB by rituximab resulted in downstream inhibition of the DR5 transcription repressor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) and concomitantly with the upregulation of DR5 expression. The role of RKIP induction by rituximab in the upregulation of DR5 and sensitization to TRAIL apoptosis was corroborated by the use of cells over expressing RKIP which were sensitive to TRAIL apoptosis in the absence of rituximab. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of rituximab-induced sensitization of B-NHL to TRAIL apoptosis via inhibition of NF-kB and Snail and upregulation of RKIP and DR-5. The combination of rituximab and TRAIL may be effective in the treatment of B-NHL. Further, our studies suggest that agents other than rituximab that can induce RKIP can reverse resistance to TRAIL in B-NHL that are unresponsive to rituximab treatment."
