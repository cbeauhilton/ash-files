    "abstract_text": "Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) are a therapeutic approach broadly used in relapse post Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (Allo-HCT). In CML relapse, DLI have proven very effective, but in other hematological malignancies its effectiveness has been reported rather erratic and poor; hence the need of a better understanding of factors influencing outcomes. Questions regarding the CD3 dose, the use of G-CSF mobilized DLI or the potential toxicity associated to the use of DLI from mismatched donors remain open. We report a cohort of 66 patients who, within a cell therapy program ( Banc de Sang i Teixits , Barcelona), consecutively underwent allo-HCT and received DLI for relapse. Disease diagnosis was as follows: Lymphoproliferative malignancy (LPD) 29 patients AML and high-risk MDS 24 patients and ALL 13 patients (CML patients were not included). Median age at allo-HCT was 48 years (5-68). The combination female-donor and male-patient was 21%. 27% allo-HCT were T-cell depleted and 29% received a myeloablative conditioning regimen. Immunosupression was CsA-based in 83% of the allo-HCT. Transplants from HLA fully match donors were 54 (81%) and 19% were from mismatch donors. Indication for DLI was morphological relapse in 61 patients (92%) and disease detected by flow cytometer or at a molecular level in 5 patients (8%). 32 (48%) DLI were obtained at stem cell collection day (G-CSF mobilized) and cryopreserved, whereas 34 (52%) DLI were obtained by lymphapheresis. The median follow-up was 198 days (9-4246). The estimated 1-year OS was 60%. A total of 100 DLI were infused, with a median of 1.5 DLI/patient and a median time from allo-HCT to DLI of 303 days (70-5153). Median CD3+ total dose was 2x10 7 CD3+/Kg (first DLI median dose was 1x10 7 CD3+/Kg). The time interval from allo-HCT to DLI \u226510 months (Log-Rank 3.64, p=0.056 ) was associated to better survival. In line with this, there was a trend in patients relapsing \u2265 9 months post allo-HCT (median relapse date) for better survival (Log-Rank 3.33, p=0.068). Twenty-six patients (42%) developed GvHD post-DLI. In 17 patients overall grade was 2-4, which was not associated to poorer outcome. Lately, 8 patients developed extensive chronic GvHD. The development of chronic GvHD was associated to a better survival (Log-Rank 6.07, p=0.014 ). A total dose \u22651x10 7 CD3+/Kg was associated to a better survival (Log-Rank 4.78, p=0.029 ) compared to total lower doses. The achievement of complete remission post DLI was also associated to better OS (Log-Rank 4.54, p=0.33). Ten patients died due to non-relapse mortality causes and twenty-seven due to disease progression. Of interest, we found a trend on outcomes when using non G-CSF mobilized DLI compared to-G-GCF mobilized DLI (Log-Rank 2.65, p= 0.104 ). However, the administration of a pre DLI debulky therapy was not associated with better outcomes. Variables with p<0.1 were included in the multivariate analysis, which identified the achievement of CR post DLI ( p=025 ), chronic GvHD ( p=0.026 ), total dose \u22651x10 7 CD3+/Kg ( p=0.026 ) and time from allo-HCT to DLI \u226510 months ( p=0.026) associated to a better OS. Overall, this study reports a poor prognostic cohort, in which the vast majority had a post allo-HCT morphological relapse. In this group, patients treated with DLI can have a prolonged survival by achieving CR. Additionally, the survival appeared to be DLI dose-dependent, since patients receiving doses \u22651x10 7 CD3+/Kg had better OS. Additionally, the development of chronic GvHD was associated to a better OS. Fig 1. OS according to the total CD3 dose infused Fig 2. OS according to the development of chronic GvHD Fig 3.
