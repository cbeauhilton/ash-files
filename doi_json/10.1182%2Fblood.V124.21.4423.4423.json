    "abstract_text": "Background: Clofarabine is a second-generation purine analogue FDA-approved as an intravenous formulation for relapsed/refractory pediatric ALL. Purine analogues demonstrate significant clinical activity in non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Clofarabine may offer pharmacologic advantages over other nucleoside analogues including being a more efficient substrate for deoxycytidine kinase, more completely inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase \u03b1, and demonstrating improved activity in cells that are non-dividing or have a low proliferation rate. This phase 1-2 trial studied an oral formulation of clofarabine in relapsed or refractory NHL. Methods: Patients were eligible if they had relapsed or refractory NHL of any histologic subtype. All pts were required to have adequate organ function and performance status \u22642 as well as absence of CNS involvement. Patients were treated at 4 dose levels (1mg, 2mg, 4mg and ultimately 3mg) with oral clofarabine administered once daily on days 1-21 of a 28 day cycle for up to 6 cycles. Three to 6 pts were treated at each dose level in a traditional 3+3 design followed by a 10 patient dose expansion at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The phase 1 portion of this study has been published (Leuk Lymph 2013; 45:1915-1920). Phase 2 was designed to enroll 24 additional subjects. The primary endpoint in phase 2 was overall response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. A total of 50 patients were accrued on the phase 1-2 trial; 31 subjects were treated in phase 1 and 19 in phase 2. Phase 2 accrual was stopped prematurely due to discontinuation of the drug formulation used in the study. All patients treated at the RP2D (n=36) are included in the phase 2 efficacy analysis since there were no differences in treatment or follow-up for these patients. Results: The median age for all patients was 69 years (range 45-92). Eighty-two percent had advanced stage at study entry. The median number of prior regimens was 2 (range 1-7) and 4 patients had prior auto stem cell transplant. Histologies included follicular lymphoma (FL, 13 pts), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL, 8 pts), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, 6 pts), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL, 11 pts), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL, 9 pts), T-cell lymphoma (TCL, 2 pts) and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL 1 pt). The 3mg dose was declared the RP2D, as previously reported. The most common toxicities were anemia (78%), leukopenia (66%), neutropenia (64%), thrombocytopenia (62%) and fatigue (60%). Twenty-nine patients (58%) experienced at least one grade 3-4 toxicity. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were leukopenia and neutropenia (48%), thrombocytopenia (30%), anemia (14%) and fatigue (6%). There were 2 deaths on study, both considered unrelated to study drug (cardiac arrest, progressive disease). The median number of cycles administered was 4, and 18 patients (36%) completed all 6 cycles of therapy. The most common reasons for discontinuing therapy were progressive disease (34%) and toxicity (16%). Of 50 patients on study, the ORR was 28% (95% CI: 16 - 42%) with complete response rate (CRR) of 10% (95% CI: 3 - 22%). An additional 36% had stable disease (SD). By histology, responses were seen in 5/11 MZL, 4/9 MCL, 3/8 SLL, 3/13 FL, and 1/1 LPL. No responses were observed in DLBCL or TCL, although an angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma patient had SD with a 42% reduction in tumor volume, and a mycosis fungoides patient had significant reduction in cutaneous disease burden. Among 36 patients treated at the RP2D and included in the phase 2 analysis, the ORR was 28% (95% CI: 14 - 45%) with CRR of 8% (95% CI: 2 - 22%), and 44% of patients with SD. A higher proportion of patients treated at a non-RP2D experienced progressive disease on study (43% vs. 28% in the RP2D cohort). The median PFS was 5.5 months, and the one- and two- year PFS were 32% (95% CI: 20%, 45%) and 16% (95% CI: 7.5%, 27%), respectively. The median duration of follow-up was 3.8 years, with 26 patients alive and 22 deceased at last follow-up; two patients were lost to follow-up. The median OS was not reached, and the 3 year OS was 58% (95% CI: 43%, 71%). Conclusion: Oral clofarabine is generally well tolerated and produces disease control in a substantial proportion of patients with relapsed/refractory NHL, particularly in indolent histologies and MCL.
