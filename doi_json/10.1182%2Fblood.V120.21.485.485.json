    "abstract_text": "Abstract 485 Transfusional iron overload (TIO) contributes considerably to treatment-related morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Data on post-HCT treatment of secondary hemochromatosis are limited. The results of an open-label, single arm, multi-center trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the iron chelator deferasirox (DEX) in recipients of HCT with TIO are presented. Patients and methods: The study was conducted in 6 German centers. The primary objective was to evaluate if DEX could provide clinically acceptable chelation in a target pool of 76 adult patients (pts) with TIO 3\u201312 months after related/unrelated HCT irrespective of conditioning regimens. TIO was defined as a serum ferritin (SF) \u22651000ng/ml without active inflammation (CRP 20 units of red blood cell transfusions (RBC) or 100mL/kg of prepacked red blood cells. Main exclusion criteria were ANC <1000/mm 3 , transaminases (TA) >5xULN, and serum creatinine (Cr) >1.5xULN. DEX 30 minutes prior to lunch was started with 10 mg/kg/d over 52 weeks or until SF 33% of baseline (BL) or was >1.5xULN. DEX had to be interrupted if any toxicity > grade 2 according to the NCI common toxicity criteria (CTC) occurred. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board reviewed safety data on an ongoing basis. Surrogate markers monitored were SF, serum transferrin and transferrin saturation (TS). Results: After a median of 168 days after HCT, 47 (62%) males and 29 (38%) females [median age 56 y] were included. Cyclosporine was taken by 54 (71%) pts. Median number of RBC prior to study entry was 37 units. Post-HCT, 14 (18.4%) pts received transfusions. Post-HCT HFE genotype was mutated in 27/67(40%) pts (heterozygote-H63D,n=13; heterozygote-C282Y,n=7; heterozygote for other mutations, n=6; homozygote-H63D,n=1). At BL, median SF and TS were 2045ng/ml and 56% respectively at a median CRP of 2.7 mg/l. SF correlated with TS (r=0.5, pgrade 2 were 1.6%, 2.3%, 5.5%, and 2.8% respectively. Main non-hematologic adverse events (AEs) were gastrointestinal (GIT) (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) (16.9%); infections (15.1%); skin (rash, erythema) (4.4%). Cr values above BL were observed in 41 (54%) pts. At EOS, median Cr was above BL by a median of 10 \u03bcmol/l. AEs were mostly mild to moderate, transient, and dose-related. On study, a median of 2 drug dosage adjustments/interruptions were made mainly for Cr elevation (27%), GIT-AEs (15%), TA elevation (10.4%), and skin AEs (3.8%). Study drug was permanently discontinued because of GIT-AEs in 3 (4%), skin AEs in 3 (4%), TA in 2 (2.6%), and Cr in 2 (2.6%) pts. Conclusions: A highly significant reduction in serum ferritin could be induced with deferasirox after allogeneic HCT with an acceptable safety profile. Stable trough serum cyclosporine levels could be maintained over time irrespective of the daily dose of deferasirox. Our results indicate that a daily dose of 7.5\u201310mg/kg is effective, and well tolerated in a complex cohort with TIO after allogeneic HCT. Disclosures: Al-Ali: Novartis: Honoraria.
