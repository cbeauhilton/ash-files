    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3802 Background: Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is a frequent complication of cancer and treatment of cancer. Among clinical guidelines, there is broad consensus regarding the importance of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized cancer patients, including prolonged prophylaxis in high-risk patients. The objective of this analysis was to assess the real-world use of prophylaxis for DVT, as well as symptomatic rates of DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) in cancer patients, both during hospitalization and after hospital discharge. Methods: Data were extracted from the US Premier Perspective(tm)-i3 Pharma Informatics linked database for non-surgical cancer patients who were admitted to hospital from January 2005 to November 2007. Included patients were aged \u2265 18 years and had \u2265 6 months' continuous plan enrollment. Patients were excluded if they were discharged to an acute-care facility, had length of hospital stay \u2264 0 or > 30 days, had missing/unknown gender or age data, or if they were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation during index hospitalization. Clinical rates of DVT/PE, as well as thromboprophylaxis status and duration were evaluated for during hospitalization and post-discharge. Results: Of the 3,759 cancer patients analyzed, 51.9% received inpatient pharmacological and/or mechanical prophylaxis, and 2.8% received outpatient pharmacological prophylaxis in the 14 days following discharge. During index hospitalization 40.0% of patients received mechanical prophylaxis and 21.1% pharmacological prophylaxis, with 9.3% of patients receiving a combination of mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis. Mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) duration of prophylaxis was 1.3 (\u00b1 2.3) days for inpatients and 0.7 (\u00b1 4.5) days post-discharge among all cancer patients. Symptomatic DVT/PE occurred in 2.4% of patients during hospitalization. In the 30 days following hospital discharge, 1.7% of patients was either rehospitalized for DVT/PE or treated for DVT/PE in the outpatient setting. Conclusions: This real-world analysis demonstrates considerable symptomatic rates of DVT/PE in hospitalized cancer patients, with approximately half of patients not receiving any thromboprophylaxis. The risk of DVT/PE persisted into the outpatient setting, but few patients received anticoagulants post-discharge. Further efforts are needed to ensure that patients with cancer receive appropriate thromboprophylaxis and that it is of adequate duration to reduce the large burden of DVT/PE.
