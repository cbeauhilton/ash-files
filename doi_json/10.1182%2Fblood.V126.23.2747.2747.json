    "abstract_text": "Introduction: AFM13 is a CD30/CD16A bispecific tetravalent TandAb antibody that recruits and activates NK-cells by specific binding to CD16A for targeted lysis of CD30 + tumor cells. Given promising clinical activity and safety profile of AFM13 and proof-of-mechanism demonstrating dependence on the immune response, potential synergy of AFM13 and checkpoint modulators was evaluated. Methods: Efficacy of AFM13 alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, or anti-CD137 antibodies was assessed by in vitro cytotoxicity assays with human PBMCs or enriched NK-cells and CD30 + target cells as well as patient-derived xenograft in vivo models with autologous PBMC. To evaluate NK-cell-mediated lysis of CD30 + lymphoma cell lines, 4 hour cytotoxicity assays were performed with PBMCs or enriched NK-cells as effector cells in the presence of suboptimal concentrations of AFM13 alone, and in combination with anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, or anti-CD137 antibodies. For the in vivo model tumor fragments derived from surgical specimens of newly diagnosed patients with CD30 + Hodgkin Lymphoma were xenografted (PDX) in immuno-deficient mice. After 28 days mice were reconstituted with autologous patient-derived PBMC and treated with AFM13 alone and in combination with anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, or anti-CD137 antibodies weekly for a total of three weeks. Tumor size, tumor-infiltrating human lymphocytes and intra-tumoral cytokines were evaluated on day 58. Results: AFM13 as a single agent at suboptimal concentrations induced effector-to-target cell-dependent lysis of CD30 + lymphoma cells up to 40% using enriched NK-cells as effector cells in a 4 hour in vitro assay. Immune-modulating antibodies alone mediated substantially lower lysis (<25%). However, the addition of anti-PD-1 or anti-CD137 to AFM13 strongly enhanced specific lysis up to 70%, whereas the addition of anti-CTLA-4 to AFM13 showed no beneficial effect. The most impressive increase of efficacy was observed when AFM13 was applied together with a combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-CD137. In vivo , reduction of tumor growth was observed when AFM13 and anti-PD-1 were used as single agents or when AFM13 was combined with anti-CD137. Synergy was most impressive in these PDX models for the combination of AFM13 and anti-PD-1 which led to a very strong reduction of tumor size. Of note, reduction of tumor growth was strongly correlated with infiltrating NK- and T-cells and intra-tumoral cytokines. Conclusions: The combination trials performed with companion intra-tumoral assessment of lymphocytes and cytokines may enhance the efficacy of AFM13 in patients. This may be explained by a potential cross-talk between NK-cells and T-cell which was enhanced when AFM13 was used in combination with checkpoint modulators.
