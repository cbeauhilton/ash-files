    "abstract_text": "Previously, we reported a study on efficacy and toxicity of cladribine (2-CdA) + prednisone (P) compared with chlorambucil (Chl) + P in previously untreated patients with progressive or symptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in a randomized multicenter trial ( Blood  2000 , 96 , 2723 ). Of 229 patients enrolled, 126 received 2-CdA+P and 103 received Chl+P. Here, we present the long-term follow-up and the results of subsequent treatment in refractory or relapsed patients. Patients with non responsive (NR) disease or with progression after 3 courses of 2-CdA + P or Chl+P or who relapsed earlier then 12 months after completing the treatment were switched to an alternative arm. Patients who relapsed later than 12 months from first remission (late relapse) were retreated with the same schedule that induced previous response. In 50 patients, non-responsive or with early relapse, treated originally with Chl+P who received 2-CdA+P as second line, complete response (CR) was achieved in 12 (24%) and overall response (OR) in 32 (64%). Twenty eight patients originally treated with 2-CdA+P received Chl+P and CR and OR was obtained in 1 (3,6%) and in 6 (21.4%), respectively (p=0.002 for both arms). Thirty three patients with late relapse were retreated with 2-CdA+P and 19 patients were retreated with Chl+P. OR (CR) was 54.6% (6.1%) and 47.4% (15.8%), respectively (p=0.34). The third line treatment was CHOP in both arms. Twenty seven patients from 2-CdA+P group and 37 patients from Chl+P group were treated with CHOP and only one patient responded. Median survival was 3.3 and 3.75 years, respectively (p=0.63). Secondary neoplasms were observed in 8 (6.4%) patients treated with 2-CdA+P and in 4 (3.9%) treated with Chl+P as first line treatment (p=0.6). Death rates have been similar in patients treated originally with 2-CdA+P 82 (64.6%) and Chl+P 69 (66.4%) (p=0.8). In conclusion, cladribine is significantly more effective as a second line treatment than chlorambucil. Both agents are similarly effective in retreatment of late relapsed patients. CHOP is of no value in patients previously treated with 2-CdA + P and with Chl + P. There is no significant difference in median survival of patients treated initially with Chl + P and 2-CdA + P.",
