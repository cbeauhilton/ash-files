    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4765 BACKGROUND Gemcitabine induces a 20% response as single agent therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL. We report phase I findings of gemcitabine in combination with standard CHOP chemotherapy with G-CSF support for intermediate grade NHL. The protocol was modified during enrollment to include rituximab in CD 20+ lymphomas. METHODS Patients received CHOP plus gemcitabine at 500 mg/m2 (Cohort 1) or 750 mg/m2 (Cohort 2) on days 1,4 of each 21 day cycle. Accrual was suspended once each cohort was filled. Dose escalation occurred after all patients in the cohort were determined to not have a dose limiting toxicity. RESULTS Between 4/02 and 5/04 10 patients were enrolled and completed the study treatment (6 in cohort 1, 4 in cohort 2). In Cohort 1, grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia, anemia, neuropathy, and constipation. Grade 4 toxicities were febrile neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. In Cohort 2, grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, mucositis, anemia and intestinal obstruction. Grade 4 toxicities included febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. One patient developed MDS 36 months after chemotherapy. Three of four patients in Cohort 2 developed dose limiting toxicities (mucositis and thrombocytopenia) requiring dose reduction of gemcitabine after cycle 1. Overall, the survival rate at 2.5 years was 71%. CONCLUSIONS This Phase I trial concludes that gemcitabine 500mg/m2 on days 1 and 4 of each 21 day cycle is the maximum tolerated dose when combined with standard CHOP chemotherapy with G-CSF support for intermediate grade NHL. Response rates are encouraging for this novel chemotherapeutic regimen. Disclosures: Off Label Use: Gemcitabine was added to standard CHOP chemotherapy in this trial.. Sikov: Eli Lilly: Honoraria.",
