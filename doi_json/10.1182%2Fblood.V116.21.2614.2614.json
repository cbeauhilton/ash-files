    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2614 X-linked Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC) is due to mutations in the DKC1 gene, which encodes the protein dyskerin. Dyskerin is a highly conserved nucleolar protein that, as part of a specialized nucleolar RNP, catalyzes the pseudouridylation of specific residues in newly synthesized ribosomal RNAs and spliceosomal snRNAs. Dyskerin also associates with telomerase and is involved in telomere maintenance. In addition to the well known effect of telomere homeostasis on cancer, it is evident that telomere maintenance may also be important in replicative aging because of telomere shortening due to the limited expression of telomerase activity in dividing somatic cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that dysfunctional telomeres resulting in premature cellular senescence is the primary cause of bone marrow failure in dyskeratosis congenita. It is important to determine the mechanism whereby Dkc1 mutations lead to premature cellular senescence in bone marrow. We have produced a line of mice containing a mutation, Dkc1 \u039415 , which is a copy of a pathogenic human mutation. Male Dkc1 \u039415 mice showed a decrease in the proportion of B and T lymphocytes in peripheral blood and reduced body weight with age but no overt bone marrow failure syndrome phenotypes. Our previous competitive bone marrow transplantation experiments showed that the Dkc1 \u039415 mutation caused decay of stem cell function with age. Bone marrow from older Dkc1 \u039415 mice was markedly inefficient in repopulation studies compared with bone marrow from age matched wild type mice. We also found that N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) could at least partially rescue the growth disadvantage of dyskerin mutant spleen cells or fibroblasts which was associated with accumulation of DNA damage and reactive oxygen species. To determine if NAC, or other antioxidants might be useful therapeutically it is important to determine their effects on stem cell function, which is defective in DC. To this end we established a cohort of mice that were given NAC in their drinking water (1mg/ml) from 3-weeks of age and maintained on NAC for 1 year. We found that long term NAC treatment did not show significant side effects on the mice. They had slightly increased neutrophils, but no difference in life span and body weight compared with the untreated group. Impressively, old male Dkc1 \u039415 mice showed corrected B and T cell proportions in peripheral blood after treatment with NAC. Competitive bone marrow transplantation experiments were carried out in which a 1:1 mixture of BM cells from mutant and WT mice was used to repopulated lethally irradiated recipient mice. These experiments showed that, when taken from NAC treated animals, old Dkc1 \u039415 BM cells could compete with age matched WT cells with 40\u201345% of Dkc1 \u039415 cells in primary recipients compared with only 20% for the untreated group. Moreover, after secondary transplantation, cells from the NAC treated group still represent 15\u201320% of Dkc1 \u039415 cells in recipients while those from the untreated group could not be detected. These results strongly suggest that NAC treatment can partially restore the bone marrow repopulating ability of Dkc1 \u039415 stem cells. Together with our previous results these data suggest that a pathogenic Dkc1 mutation, through its effect on telomerase, initiates stem cell aging before telomeres are short and that increased oxidative stress might play a role in this process. Moreover the effects of the mutation may be prevented or delayed by antioxidant treatment, although the precise mechanism will be the subject of future investigation.
