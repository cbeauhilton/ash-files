    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The overall survival of children with ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) has improved markedly over the last decade, yet relapse occurs in about 20% of patients. The spread of leukemic blasts to the Central Nervous System (CNS) and increased resistance to therapy due to cell adherence within the Bone Marrow (BM) or CNS constitutes major challenges to treatment. For these reasons, adhesion molecules governing the homing and adhesion of leukemic cells are perceived to be of extraordinary importance, both as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Integrins constitute a large family of heterodimeric receptors composed of alpha and beta subunits, which play important roles during homing and migration of normal leucocytes by facilitating adhesion to both stromal cells and components of the extracellular matrix. Increased expression of CD49d (integrin subunit \u03b14) is a marker for adverse prognosis in ALL and recently, CD49f (integrin subunit \u03b16) was shown to facilitate metastasis of ALL xenografts to the central nervous system in mice (Yao H et al., Nature 2018). Methods Previous studies of integrins in BCP-ALL have focused on individual alpha integrins in xenograft models and were based on limited numbers of clinical samples. The present study was based on a large number of Danish pediatric BCP-ALL patients stratified between 2012-2018 using Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) according to the Nordic NOPHO-2008 protocol (Toft N et al., Eur J Haematol 2013). Diagnostic BM samples were subjected to flowcytometric analysis (FCM) of CD49f (n=246) and CD49d (n=135), using a backbone of lineage-specific B-cell markers (CD45, CD10, CD19, CD20). Leukemic blasts were detected in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) using high-sensitivity FCM and the following markers CD45, CD10, CD19, CD20, CD34 and CD38 (n = 246, with matching BM and CSF samples). Results Our data provided us with a unique possibility to identify the role of CD49d and CD49f with respect to minimal residual disease (MRD) at the end of induction therapy (day 29), which is considered the most important prognostic factor in paediatric lymphoblastic leukemia. We found that CD49f was more highly expressed in patients with MRD \u2265 0,1% at day 29 than patients with MRD < 0,1% (p = 0,01), whereas no difference was seen with respect to CD49d. We also investigated the correlation between white blood cell (WBC) and surface expression of CD49d and CD49f in diagnostic BM blasts with respect to different cytogenetic subtypes. A Kruskall-Wallis test showed that the expression varies according to genetic subtypes (p\u20390.0001). We found that the expression of CD49d was highest among the high hyperdiploid and iAMP21 (intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21) patients, whereas the expression of CD49f was highest among the t12,21 and iAMP21 patients. Notably, the expression of CD49f was inversely correlated to WBC (r=0,17, p=0.01), which was most pronounced among the patients in the B-other cytogenetic subgroup defined as leukaemia that could not be classified into the existing cytogenetic groups (r=0,42, P\u20390.0001). In case of strong adherence to BM, lower levels of leukemic blasts might be expected in circulation resulting in high MRD but low WBC. Therefore, both MRD and WBC data are consistent with a prominent adhesive role of CD49f within BM. In contrast, we found significantly lower CD49f surface expression in diagnostic BM samples in patients with leukemic blasts within CSF (p=0.0297). Conclusions: Recently, Yao et al. (2018) showed that ALL cells in circulation are unable to breach the blood-brain barrier in mice and instead employ CD49f (integrin \u03b16) to migrate into the CNS along vessels that connect vertebral or calvarial bone marrow and the subarachnoid space. Potentially, this mechanism could account for cases of ALL relapse within CNS. Our work shows a strong association between high MRD and the expression of CD49f which is a function that would have been anticipated for CD49d due to previous works with ALL and CLL. Furthermore, we found significantly lower CD49f surface expression in leukemic blasts within the BM in patients with CSF involvement and therefore no support for the recently proposed role of CD49f in facilitating the spread of leukemic cells to the CNS.
