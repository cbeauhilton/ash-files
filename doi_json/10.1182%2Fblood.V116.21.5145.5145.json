    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5145 Introduction and aims: Iron deficiency as a major component in the pathogenesis of anemia in cancer is not acknowledged by most oncologists, possibly except when arising from GI blood loss. Iron deficiency is associated with clinical symptoms such as cognitive impairment, fatigue, and reduced exercise performance. New iron formulations are available that allow rapid iron supplementation with single infusions. This treatment could ameliorate symptoms of iron deficiency and correct anemia. Here, we studied iron parameters and their correlation with erythropoiesis and inflammatory markers in a large unselected cohort of patients with cancer. In addition, we investigated the suitability of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) as parameter for assessment of the iron status. Patients and methods: Data from 1627 patients (median age: 66.4 years, range: 20\u201397 years) presenting sequentially at the Center for Oncology and Hematology, Wilhelminenspital, Vienna between October 01, 2009 and January 26, 2010, have retrospectively been analyzed. Patients were at different stages of their disease or may not have had an established diagnosis at the time of testing. In patients with multiple testing during this period only the first sample taken was included. TSAT (n=1516), serum ferritin (n=887), serum iron, CRP, and complete blood count, were determined by using standard techniques. Commonly used definitions for absolute iron deficiency (AID), [TSAT <20% and serum ferritin <30ng/ml, in case serum ferritin was not available TSAT <10%] and for functional iron deficiency (FID), [TSAT <20% and serum ferritin \u226530ng/ml, in case serum ferritin was not available TSAT between 10 and 20%] have been applied. Fisher's exact test was used for comparison of frequencies and Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient for evaluation of correlation. Results: Table 1 shows the distribution of TSAT and serum ferritin categories in 1627 patients with cancer. AID was found in 116 patients (7.7%) of the 1516 patients for whom TSAT was available. Eighty-three (72%) of the AID patients presented with anemia (defined by hemoglobin <12g/dl). AID was most common in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer (12% and 11%, respectively), and not present in patients with testicular and prostate cancer (p=0.013). FID was diagnosed in 530 patients (35%) and 222 (42%) of them were found to be also anemic. Table 1 Swallow events tagged in relation to hyoid displacement measures a View large View Large Multivariate analysis revealed a statistically significant correlation between TSAT and serum ferritin (R=0.286, p<0.001), serum iron (R=0.874, p<0.001), hemoglobin (R=0.201, p<0.001) and CRP (R=-0.205, p<0.001) ( figure 1 ). Serum ferritin, in contrast, did not correlate with serum iron (R=0.051, p=0.132), but correlated with hemoglobin (R=-0.259, p<0.001), TSAT (R=0.286, p<0.001), and CRP (R=0.396, p<0.001). View large Download slide View large Download slide Conclusion: AID (7.7%) and even more so FID (35%) are frequent co-morbidities in patients with various types of cancer. Seventy-two percent of patients with AID and 42% with FID presented with overt anemia. TSAT correlated closely with serum iron and hemoglobin levels and seems to be the preferred parameter for assessment of iron status in patients with chronic diseases often complicated by increased inflammation. Serum ferritin was found to be an inadequate parameter for assessment and monitoring of iron status. As iron deficiency has been linked with various symptoms, the question arises whether iron supplementation would benefit patients with FID without overt anemia. Future studies should evaluate the role of novel intravenous iron preparations in ameliorating the symptoms of iron deficiency with or without anemia.
