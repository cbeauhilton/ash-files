    "abstract_text": "Backgroun d: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic cancer which is characterized by clonal immune globulin. In recent years, FAP\u03b1+ fibroblast has been found in many tumor microenvironments, and play an important role in tumor immune escape. Furthermore, we find monocyte-derived macrophages can also express FAP\u03b1+ under existence of MM cell line. Objective Explore the impact of FAP\u03b1+ Macrophage in MM immune microenvironment. Methods Western blot(WB) and flow cytometry(FCM) was used to detect the expression of FAP\u03b1+ on macrophages. WB was used to detect the PDL1 altering. FCM was used to detect FAP\u03b1+ PDL1+macrophages in patient with myeloma. FCM was used to detect apoptosis of CD4+/CD8+ T cells and MM cells. Results: 1.MM cell line can induce FAP\u03b1+ expression on Macrophage through TGF\u03b21 or CSF1. 2.Over-expression FAP\u03b1 on macrophage can promote the expression of PDL1 and knock-down FAP\u03b1 can reduce PDL1. 3.FAP\u03b1 can increases mRNA PDL1 and partially inhibits ubiquitination mediating autophagy of PDL1. 4.Over-expression FAP\u03b1 on macrophage can induce CD4+/CD8+T cell apoptosis and knock-down FAP\u03b1 can reduce T cell apoptosis. 5. FAP\u03b1 inhibitor combined with anti-PDL1 or anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody can promote CD138+MM cell apoptosis. Conclusions: MM can induce macrophage expressing FAP\u03b1 to further promote PDL1 expression and mediate MM immune escape. Combination of FAP\u03b1 inhibitor with anti-PDL1 or anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody may facilitate immunotherapy effect in MM treatment.
