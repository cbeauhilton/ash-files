    "abstract_text": "Background: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia in the United States. Clinical heterogeneity, a characteristic feature of CLL is a major problem in the clinical management of this currently incurable leukemia. We and others have demonstrated that the tissue microenvironment, specifically the lymph node (LN), influence the biological and clinical behavior including the clinical heterogeneity of CLL. Using gene expression profiling of CLL cells from peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM) and LNs, we identified Cav-1 a member of the Tolerogenic Signature (genes associated with host immune tolerance) as one of the candidate genes which might be involved in the pathogenesis of CLL. We found that Cav-1 levels were significantly elevated (11 fold) in CLL cells from LNs compared to BM and PB. Cav-1 is the major element of caveolae, which are flask-shaped membrane invaginations. Cav-1 is involved in multiple cellular processes like the regulation and transportation of cellular cholesterol and lipids, clathrin independent endocytosis and signal transduction leading to oncogenesis or tumor suppression. We have previously shown that knock down of Cav-1 results in a significant decrease in cell migration and proliferation of primary human CLL cells in vitro . We have also demonstrated that knock down of Cav-1 prevents CLL cells from forming immune synapses. These immune synapses are important for the interaction between the CLL cells and their tumor microenvironment. These results suggest that Cav-1 protect CLL cells from undergoing apoptosis and enhances their migration in vitro . Objectives and Methodology: To understand the precise role of Cav-1 in leukemic progression in vivo, we crossed Cav-1 -/- mice to E\u00b5-TCL1 mice, which is a well-established transgenic murine model for CLL. The offspring were observed and evaluated for the development of CLL. These mice were sacrificed at the age of 12, 24, 36 and 40+ weeks and peripheral blood, bone marrow and spleen and were examined for the presence of CD5+B220+CD19+ CLL cells using flow cytometry. Spleen, lymph nodes, liver, lungs and kidney were evaluated for the presence of CLL cells using H&E staining of histologic slides. Results: To study the role of Cav-1 in E\u00b5-TCL1, we isolated splenic B cells and measured the expression of Cav-1. We observed a gradual increase in the expression of Cav-1 in splenic B cells from E\u00b5-TCL1 mice at age of 12, 24 and 36 weeks when compared with wild type mice. This suggested that Cav-1 might be playing a role in CLL progression in E\u00b5-TCL1 mice. Therefore, to study the role of Cav-1 in CLL disease progression we decreased the expression of Cav-1 in vivo by breeding E\u00b5-TCL1 with Cav1 knockout mice. We generated E\u00b5-TCL1-Cav1 -/+ and E\u00b5-TCL1-Cav1 -/- mice to study the effect of Cav-1 knock down in aggressiveness of CLL in vivo . We have shown that Cav-1 is overexpressed in CLL cells from patients with poorer clinical outcome and protects CLL cells from undergoing apoptosis. Therefore, we analyze the number of CLL cells in E\u00b5-TCL1-Cav1 -/+ and E\u00b5-TCL1-Cav1 -/- mice. We observed a significant reduction in the number of B220+CD5+ CLL cells population in bone marrow and spleen of E\u00b5-TCL1-Cav1 -/+ and E\u00b5-TCL1-Cav1 -/- mice when compared with E\u00b5-TCL1-Cav1 wt/wt mice. We have previously shown that Cav-1 is important for CLL cells migration in vitro . Therefore, to study its effect in vivo we analyzed infiltration of CLL cells in spleen, lymph nodes, liver, kidney and lungs in these mice. There was no or significant decrease in tumor infiltration of CLL cells in spleen, lymph nodes, liver, lungs and kidney in E\u00b5-TCL1-Cav1 -/+ and E\u00b5-TCL1-Cav1 -/- mice when compared with E\u00b5-TCL1-Cav1 wt/wt alone. Next, we wanted to examine the effect of Cav-1 knock down on splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. We found that there was a significant decrease in splenomegaly and hepatomegaly in E\u00b5-TCL1-Cav1 -/+ and E\u00b5-TCL1-Cav1 -/- mice. The spleen and liver size of E\u00b5-TCL1-Cav1 -/+ and E\u00b5-TCL1-Cav1 -/- mice was significantly reduced when compared with E\u00b5-TCL1 mice. Together these results suggest that high expression of Cav-1 in CLL cells leads to enhance proliferation and promotes disease progression in E\u00b5-TCL1 mice.
