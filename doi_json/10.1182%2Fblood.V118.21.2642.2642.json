    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2642 BAFF is essential for B cell maturation, and a lack of either BAFF or its primary receptor, BAFF-R, results in a severe depletion of T2 marginal zone and follicular B cells. Elevated serum BAFF levels have been correlated with an increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), along with a more aggressive phenotype. A growing body of genetic evidence points toward an association between the development of human disease and variation in genes encoding BAFF and its receptors. Recently, we characterized a novel lymphoma-associated mutation in TNFRSF13C , the gene encoding BAFF-R. This mutation (BAFF-R H159Y) encodes a His159Tyr substitution in the C-terminus of BAFF-R adjacent to the TRAF3 binding motif. Signaling through BAFF-R H159Y results in increased NF-\u03baB activity, elevated immunoglobulin production and increased association with TRAF2, TRAF3 and TRAF6 compared to wild type (WT) BAFF-R. We have detected this mutation in 6% of total NHL cases (n=129), and in 10% of follicular lymphoma (FL) cases (n=41) evaluated thus far. We previously reported that BAFF-R H159Y expressing mouse B cells exhibited significantly more resistance to Fas ligand (FasL) induced apoptosis compared to their cells expressing BAFF-R WT, and we propose here that BAFF-R H159Y mediated increases in PI3K activity may explain such an enhanced anti-apoptotic response. In this study we now show that BAFF stimulated HEK 293 cells stably expressing BAFF-R H159Y not only display significantly increased Akt phosphorylation when compared to BAFF-R WT expressing cells, but also demonstrate robust Akt phosphorylation in the absence of BAFF. BAFF-R H159Y-dependent Akt activation also led to activation of the downstream Akt targets mTOR and GSK3\u03b2 and their phosphorylation was inhibited following treatment with the PI3- kinase inhibitor wortmannin. We next examined the impact of the BAFF-R H159Y mutation on expression of BAFF-target genes. Quantitative PCR analyses revealed that BAFF-R H159Y cells exhibited a pattern of gene expression indicative of promoting cell survival, displaying significantly higher levels of BCL2 , BCL2L1 and PIN1 , while down-regulating expression of the pro-apoptotic gene BIM . We recently reported that TRAF6 associates with BAFF-R, and that such binding is more pronounced in cells expressing BAFF-R H159Y. In order to investigate the role TRAF6 plays in mediating BAFF-R-dependent PI3K activity, we silenced TRAF6 expression in HEK 293 and Karpas 422 lymphoma cells using TRAF6 shRNA. Reduced TRAF6 protein expression resulted in a parallel decrease in BAFF-R WT mediated phosphorylation of mTOR in Karpas 422 cells and phosphorylation of both Akt and GSK3\u03b2 was markedly reduced in BAFF-R H159Y expressing HEK 293 cells. Interestingly, TRAF6 knock-down did not affect NF-kB2 activation in either Karpas 422 or HEK BAFF-R expressing cells suggesting that Akt does not play a role in BAFF-R mediated activation of non-canonical NF-kB. Finally, preliminary co-precipitation studies indicate that Akt can be recruited to BAFF-R itself, and our initial observations suggest that such an association is significantly reduced in cells expressing BAFF-R H159Y. Taken together, these studies suggest that the BAFF-R H159Y mutation confers enhanced BAFF-R-dependent PI3K signaling and pro-survival gene expression independent of BAFF. Moreover, such enhanced P13K activation is partly dependent upon TRAF6, and decreased recruitment of Akt to BAFF-R H159Y may function to increase the amount of this PI3K target for activation. Thus, BAFF-R H159Y likely contributes to BAFF signaling irregularities in NHL patients harboring this mutation, and may predispose individuals to developing lymphoma regardless of their serum BAFF concentration.
