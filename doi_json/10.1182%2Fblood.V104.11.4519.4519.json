    "abstract_text": "Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a severe complication in patients (pts) treated for acute leukemia. Since its diagnosis is still difficult, sets of non-invasive diagnostic criteria were recently proposed by IFIGC/MSG/EORTC for study purposes. The performance of those criteria in the clinical management of unselected leukemic pts is still unknown. We have therefore applied IFIGC/MSG/EORTC criteria to the diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates occurred in 83 consecutive pts, aged <65, with newly diagnosed acute leukemia (19 APL, 38 AML, 26 ALL) treated at a single Institution between 1/2000 and 12/2003. The frequency of the different categories of IPA as diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates and the relative contribution of the specific sets of diagnostic criteria were analysed. Forty-one pulmonary infiltrates developed in 30/83 pts (36.1%), during 364 chemotherapy cycles. IPA was diagnosed in 22 pts (26.5%). \u201cProven\u201d IPA occurred in 1 (1.2%), \u201cprobable\u201d IPA in 7 (8.4%) and \u201cpossible\u201d IPA in 14 pts (16.8%). IPA was significantly more frequent in AML (36,8%), than in APL (15,7%) or ALL (15,3%) (P=0.041), and during the first induction (21/83; 25.3%) than during subsequent cycles (20/281; 7.1%) (P< 0.001). Considering the episodes of pulmonary infiltrate, IPA criteria were met in 27/41 (65,8%) [1 \u201cproven\u201d, 7 \u201cprobable\u201d (17%) and 19 \u201cpossible\u201d (46,3%)]. Specifically, \u201chost criteria\u201d were met in 41/41 (100%), \u201cmicrobiological criteria\u201d in 8/41 (17%), and \u201cclinical criteria\u201d in 27/41 (65,8%). The presence of one \u201cmajor clinical\u201d criterion, i.e. a typical radiological image on chest Xray or CT, was significantly associated with the positivity of a \u201cmicrobiological\u201d criterion, hence with a diagnosis of \u201cprobable\u201d IPA (P=0,012). On the other hand, since \u201chost\u201d criteria were not discriminant, being positive in 100% of cases, the presence of two aspecific \u201cminor clinical\u201d criteria (dyspnea, cough, pleural rub, chest pain, hemophtysis) was the sole responsible for the classification of any non-typical pulmonary infiltrate either as \u201cpossible\u201d IPA (17/19 cases; 84.2 %) or as \u201cno IPA\u201d. The bacterial origin of the pulmonary infiltrate was documented on follow-up in 5/19 \u201cpossible\u201d IPA, which responded to specific antibacterial treatment. All patients had received antifungal prophylaxis, in 88% with oral itraconazole. A clinical response to ampho/voriconazole was obtained in 6/8 (71,4%) \u201cproven/probable\u201d and 17/19 (89,4%) \u201cpossible\u201d IPA. Four of 22 pts with IPA (2 \u201cprobable\u201d and 2 \u201cpossible\u201d) died early during aplasia (multiorgan failure (MOF) 3, cerebral hemorrhage 1) compared to 2/8 pts without IPA (MOF 1, leukemia 1). In conclusion, according to IFIGC/MSG/EORTC criteria, IPA was diagnosed in 26.5% of pts with acute leukemia and in 65,8% of pulmonary infiltrates. AML and the first induction cycle were significant risk factors. \u201cProven\u201d IPA was rare. \u201cProbable\u201d IPA was more frequent (8,4% of pts), its diagnosis being strongly supported by the association of a \u201cmajor\u201d clinical criterion with one microbiological criterion. \u201cPossible IPA\u201d likely represents an overestimation (43,9% of pulmonary infiltrates) since its diagnosis derived in most cases from the combined presence of a \u201chost\u201d criterion with two \u201cminor\u201d aspecific clinical criteria. These data allow a critical analysis of IFIGC/MSG/EORTC criteria in the setting of acute leukemia."
