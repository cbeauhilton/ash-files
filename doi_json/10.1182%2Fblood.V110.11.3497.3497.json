    "abstract_text": "Clinical risk classifications fail to predict relapse (REL) in about 25% and 50% of high- and standard-risk (HR, SR) ALL patients (pts.), respectively, with potential under-/over-exposure to chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT, with intrinsic mortality \u226520%). Between 2000\u20135, we studied MRD as major predictive factor for REL and key decisional tool for SCT or less aggressive therapy in individual pts. with SR/HR ALL. Induction/consolidation consisted of Ida/V/P/Asp/CY (blocks 1\u20133,5,6,8), HD-MTX/Ara-C (4,7), CNS phase and imatinib (Ph+). Risk classes were SR (pre-B, WBC30 [B]/100 [T]), and very HR (VHR) i.e. Ph/t(4;11)+. All cases were screened for fusion genes or IgH/TCR\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4/Kde rearrangements (23/22 PCR amplifications for B/T subsets, respectively). Marrow cells obtained before blocks 4,6,8 (week 10,16,22 i.e. timepoints [TP]1-3) were analyzed by RQ-PCR using 1 or more pt.-specific probes. MRD negativity (M neg ) was defined by negative/low-positive (<10 \u22124 ) TP2 and negative TP3. MRD-based therapy consisted of maintenance in M neg , SCT (family-related/unrelated) in M pos (positive), and 2\u20134 autologous stem cell-supported Hypercycles (H/C: L-PAM/VP/6MP; HD-MTX/Ara-C) plus maintenance in M pos without donor. VHR pts. were always eligible to SCT. Pts. with undefined MRD were treated by risk class. Of 280 total pts. (median age 38 years [range 16\u201366], SR 96, HR 90, VHR 89, unknown 5), 236 achieved CR (84%). 279 total probe(s) were obtained in 199 CR pts. (84%), with sensitivity \u226510 \u22124 in 89%. 142 pts. completed consolidation and 94 did not (relapse 19%, early SCT 12%, violations/toxicity 7%); 18 (13%) lacked a probe and 12 (8%) were not correctly sampled at TP1-3. 112 pts. were exactly classified as M neg (n 58, 52%) or M pos (n 54, 48%), with some influence from VHR class (P=.044). With minimum FUP 1 year, 117 (50%) pts. relapsed and 28 (12%) died in CR (13 after SCT, 22%). For CR pts., 5-year overall survival (OS), REL-free survival (RFS) and cumulative REL incidence (CIR) were 54/42/56% in SR, 31/28/65% in HR and 28/24/65% in VHR. In M neg pts., OS/RFS/CIR were 75/72/28% vs 33/14/79% in M pos (P<.001), with no difference by clinical risk class, vs 39/37/55% in pts. with unknown MRD. The dominant predictive role of MRD for REL was confirmed by Cox regression (Haz. Ratio 5.72, P<.001). Also, when TP3 MRD results were compared to TP1, 36/39 (92%) and 41/47 (87%) pts. were confirmed M pos and M neg , respectively, while only 9 changed MRD risk class (P<.001); MRD remained the most significant prognostic factor, along with WBC count (B subsets: OS 79% in M neg vs 33% in M pos /WBC<30 vs 0% in M pos /WBC>30; P<.001). Finally, M pos pts. could be rescued by SCT (3-year RFS 40%) and H/C (53%), particularly those with WBC<30 (58%) who became M neg (79%). Early MRD analysis with \u22651 probe(s) supports optimal therapeutic choices in ALL. M pos \u226510 \u22124 confers the highest risk, mandating for early SCT/experimental therapy. Confirmed M neg status allows standard therapy with minimal mortality and expected RFS \u226570%."
