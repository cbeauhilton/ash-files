    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: CTL019 (tisagenlecleucel) is an investigational chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy that identifies and eliminates CD19-expressing B cells. JULIET (NCT02445248) is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, global, pivotal phase 2 trial of CTL019 in adults with relapsed/refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The primary objective was met at the interim analysis, with the best overall response (ORR) of 59% (complete response [CR], 43%; partial response [PR], 16%). Here, we report the results of the primary analysis of the JULIET study. METHODS: Eligible patients were 18 years or older with r/r DLBCL and had progressed after receiving \u22652 lines of chemotherapy, and were ineligible for or failed autologous stem cell transplant (auto-SCT). Centrally manufactured CAR T cells were provided to patients at 27 study centers in 10 countries on 4 continents using cryopreserved apheresis, central production facilities and a global supply chain. CTL019 was manufactured at 2 sites (United States and Germany). Autologous T cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding an anti-CD19 scFv-CD3\u03b6-4-1BB CAR, expanded ex vivo, cryopreserved, shipped, and infused at study centers. The primary endpoint was best ORR (CR + PR) per independent review committee. RESULTS: As of data cutoff (8 March 2017), 147 patients were enrolled and 99 were infused with a single dose of CTL019 transduced cells (median, 3.1 \u00d7 10 8 [range, 0.1-6.0 \u00d7 10 8 ] cells). 90% of patients received bridging therapy. Prior to infusion, patients underwent restaging, and 93% received lymphodepleting chemotherapy (73% received fludarabine 25 mg/m 2 /cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m 2 /day \u00d7 3 days and 19% received bendamustine 90 mg/m 2 /day \u00d7 2 days). Median time from infusion to data cutoff was 5.6 months. The median age was 56 years (range, 22-76); 77% of patients had stage III or IV disease at study entry. The median number of prior lines of antineoplastic therapy was 3 (range, 1-6; 95% received \u22652 and 51% received \u22653 prior lines); 47% of patients had prior auto-SCT. In this primary analysis of patients who received CTL019 from the US manufacturing site, among 81 infused patients with \u22653 months follow-up or earlier discontinuation the best ORR was 53.1% (95% CI, 42% to 64%; P <.0001) with 39.5% CR and 13.6% PR. At month 3, the CR rate was 32% and the PR rate 6%. Among patients evaluable at 6 months (n=46), the CR rate was 30% and PR rate was 7%. Response rates were consistent across prognostic subgroups (including those who received prior auto-SCT and those with double-hit lymphoma). Median duration of response was not reached; the 6-month probability of being relapse free was 73.5% (95% CI, 52.0% to 86.6%). Median overall survival was not reached; the 6-month probability of overall survival was 64.5% (95% CI, 51.5% to 74.8%). No patient who achieved a response (CR or PR) proceeded to allogenic- or auto-SCT. CTL019 was detected in peripheral blood by quantitative PCR for up to 367 days in responders. Overall, 86% of patients had grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 58% of infused patients, with 15% grade 3 and 8% grade 4 using the Penn grading scale and managed by a protocol-specific algorithm. 15% of patients received anti-IL6 therapy, tocilizumab, for CRS management with good response and 11% of patients received corticosteroids. Other grade 3 or 4 AEs of special interest included neurologic AEs (12%, managed with supportive care), cytopenias lasting >28 days (27%), infections (20%), and febrile neutropenia (13%). Three patients died within 30 days of infusion, all due to disease progression. No deaths were attributed to CTL019. No CRS or neurologic event associated deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: CTL019 produces high response rates with 95% of CRs at 3 months being sustained at 6 months in a cohort of highly pretreated adult patients with r/r DLBCL, results which confirm the findings of our earlier interim analysis. Centralized manufacturing was feasible in the first global study of CAR T cell therapy in DLBCL. CRS and other AEs could be effectively and reproducibly managed by appropriately trained investigators without treatment-related mortality.
