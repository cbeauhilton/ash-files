    "abstract_text": "Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) are aggressive tumors with distinct cells of origin and pathomorphological features. However, these lymphomas share certain transcriptional signatures and aberrant signaling pathways. CHLs and PMBLs both exhibit constitutive activation of NF-\u03baB and JAK/STAT signaling and genetic bases of PD-1 mediated immune evasion including frequent 9p24.1/ PD-L1 / PD-L2 copy gains. In both lymphomas, PD-1 blockade is a FDA-approved therapy for relapsed/refractory disease. To characterize genetic bases of response to PD-1 blockade and identify complementary treatment targets in cHL and PMBL, we defined the comprehensive genetic signatures of both diseases. First, we obtained flow cytometry-sorted Hodgkin Reed Sternberg (HRS) cells from 23 biopsies of newly diagnosed cHLs and intact tumor biopsy specimens from 37 newly diagnosed PMBLs. The isolated HRS cells and paired normal DNAs and PMBL biopsy specimens were subjected to whole exome sequencing using an optimized workflow for low input samples and an expanded bait set to capture structural variants (SVs), including translocations. We used newly developed and established analytical pipelines to analyze tumor samples without paired normals (PMBLs) and identify significantly mutated genes (candidate cancer genes [CCGs], MutSig2CV, CLUMPS) , SCNAs ( GISTIC2.0) and SVs(4 algorithms) in both cHL and PMBL. In cHL, we identified 15 CCGs, 13 recurrent SCNAs, SVs in ETV6 and CIITA , complementary alterations of JAK/STAT, NF-\u03baB and PI3K signaling pathway components and a median number of 11 genetic drivers per tumor. Previously unappreciated aspects of the cHL genetic signature included the increased incidence of driver mutational events in cHLs with ARID1A alterations (p=0.012). Analyses of co-occurring genetic events in EBV + and EBV - cHLs confirmed that EBV - cHLs were significantly more likely to exhibit alterations of specific NF-\u03baB signaling intermediaries (such as TNFAIP3 mutation and/or focal copy loss, p=0.006) and perturbations of MHC class I antigen presentation pathway components (inactivating B2M mutations, HLA-B mutations or focal copy loss of 6p21.32/ HLA-B , p=0.008). The latter findings provide genetic bases for the reported differences in cell surface expression of MHC class I in EBV + and EBV - cHLs. In PMBL, we defined 15 CCGs and more selective perturbations of specific epigenetic modifiers ( ZNF217 and EZH2 ), transcription factors ( PAX5 and IRF2BP2 ) and TP53 , in comparison with cHL. The majority of these alterations were clonal supporting their role as early drivers. We identified 18 SCNAs and additional SVs in CIITA and PD-1 ligands, recurrent alterations of JAK/STAT and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway components and a median of 9 genetic drivers per PMBL. Antigen presentation pathways in PMBL were perturbed by multiple recurrent alterations, including B2M mutations, focal copy losses of B2M and the MHCI/II loci, SVs of CTIIA and EZH2 mutations. There was a significant correlation between genetic perturbations of MHC class I pathway components and absence of MHC class I expression in PMBL, as previously described in cHL. Recurrent cHL alterations including B2M, TNFAIP3, STAT6, GNA13 and XPO1 CCGs and 2p/2p15/2p16.1, 6p21.32, 6q23.2 and 9p/9p24.1 SCNAs were also identified in >20% of PMBLs, highlighting shared pathogenetic mechanisms in these diseases. These tumors of predominantly young adults (median age: cHL 26 yrs; PMBL 34 yrs) both had a high rate of spontaneous deamination of CpGs, a clock-like mutational signature that is typically associated with aging. CHLs and PMBLs both exhibited previously uncharacterized molecular features that may increase sensitivity to PD-1 blockade, including high mutational burdens, in comparison with other lymphoid and solid tumors. In particular, the mutational burden in EBV - cHLs was among the highest reported, similar to that in carcinogen-induced cancers (melanoma and NSCLC). Additionally, both cHLs and PMBLs had an increased incidence of microsatellite instability and APOBEC mutational signatures, features associated with a more favorable response to PD-1 blockade. Taken together, these data define genetic similarities and differences in cHL and PMBL and establish a framework to comprehensively assess molecular bases of response to PD-1 blockade and develop rational combination therapies in these diseases.
