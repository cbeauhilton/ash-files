Alongside efficacy considerations, analyses on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) may help more fully establish a regimen's overall treatment profile. HRQoL improvements with MPR-R were observed during MPR induction as well as lenalidomide maintenance, documenting a well-balanced profile in terms of efficacy, tolerability and HRQoL [Dimopoulos, 2011]. Alternative findings on novel NDMM treatment have shown efficacy of melphalan, prednisone and bortezomib (VMP) treatment to be associated with an intermittent deterioration in patients' HRQoL [Dhawan, 2009]. Methods: A mixed effects model was developed based on parameters pre-selected as potentially clinically relevant in impacting HRQoL. Models were run on six domains pre-selected based on clinical relevance: Global QoL, Physical Functioning, Fatigue and Pain (from EORTC QLQ-C30), and Disease Symptoms and Side Effects of Treatment (from EORTC MY20). Cycle 16 was determined as the last observation time point with a statistically meaningful sample size at time of follow-up (May 2010). Following explanatory variables were included: time-dependant covariates at individual HRQoL measurement time points (i.e. cycle 4, 7, 10, 13 and 16), treatment group (MPR-R vs. MP), gender (Female vs. Male), age, baseline QoL, Partial Response (PR) vs. Stable Disease (SD) and Very Good Partial Response or better (\u2265VGPR) vs. SD, Progressive Disease (PD) and Discontinuation (DC). Neutropenia and anemia, both Grade 3 or 4, were considered the clinically most relevant safety parameters. Main results for Global QoL are reported, with results from other domains found to be comparable. Results: Across all time-dependant covariates, a statistically significant reduction on Global QoL (\u22124.63; p=.004) was observed at Cycle 4. Being female vs. male significantly reduced Global QoL by -\u2212.07 (p=.026). Each additional life year was found to lower Global QoL b\u2212 \u22120.40 points (p=.034). Baseline Global QoL was also significant, each additional score point leading to +0.30 (p <.001). A response level of \u2265VGPR vs. SD increased Global QoL by 9.11 (p=.023); Progressive Disease (PD) reduced Global QoL by -\u2212.34 score points (p <.001). All other pre-defined variables did not significantly impact Global QoL. Clinically meaningful changes for Global QoL in the underlying patient population have been determined to constitute at least a 7-point change [Dimopoulos, 2011]. Progressive disease (reducing Global QoL), respectively \u2265VGPR (increasing Global QoL) exerted clinically meaningful changes, as did anemia grade 3\u20134, which had a clinically meaningful, but not statistically significant negative impact (\u22129.85; p=.057). Although no significant direct effect of MPR-R over MP on Global QoL was detected in the underlying model, MPR-R displays properties which favor an improved HRQoL profile, including a stronger delay in PD and higher % of VGPR vs. MP patients. Furthermore, certain properties more frequently observed with MPR-R than MP (neutropenia grade 3 or 4 and discontinuation, DC) were shown not to have a significant impact on HRQoL. Anemia grade 3 or 4, exerted a clinically meaningful negative effect but was not significantly more often observed with MPR-R compared to MP (24% vs. 17%, p= 0.091). Conclusions: More patients achieved \u2265VGPR when receiving continuous MPR-R treatment than those receiving MP. In the above pooled analysis, \u2265VGPR was shown to improve Global QoL in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant way. Furthermore, progression was also shown to negatively impact Global QoL (\u22128.34; p <.001), with MPR-R significantly reducing the risk of disease progression over MP. Delaying progression with continuous MPR-R therefore helps to maintain a high Global QoL.  View large View Large Disclosures: Dimopoulos: Celgene: Consultancy, Honoraria.
