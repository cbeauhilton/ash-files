    "abstract_text": "Background: The aging marrow stem cell demonstrates more somatic mutations when compared to younger marrow stem cells. These abnormalities have been noted in pts with MDS, as well as in patients with normal peripheral blood counts (Steensma et al, Blood 2015; Jaiswal et al, N Engl J Med 2014). Mutations are rarely detected in people 1 (Figure 1). Table 1 shows the most frequent clonal myeloid mutations in ONTIME, based on age above and below 75 years (the median age in ONTIME). Table 3.

Over 45% of patients had 1 mutational abnormality, and 44% had >1. Of note, patients under and over the median age of pts with MDS had a similar mutational pattern, which was not influenced by either length of time since diagnosis of MDS or prior treatment with an HMA. In this analysis, the mutational genomic abnormalities in the MDS marrow stem cell were similar among younger and older patients with MDS, suggesting the underlying pathogenic mechanisms causing these abnormalities are also similar irrespective of patient age.
