    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) carrying t(8;21)(q22;q22) and inv(16)/t(16;16)(p13;q22) are classified as French-American-British (FAB) AML subtype M2 or monocytic with eosinophilic differentiation (M4Eo) by morphology and as core binding factor (CBF)-AML according to pathogenesis. CBF-AML accounts for approximately 15% of AML and frequently harbors c-KIT mutation (17\u223c46%). C-KIT mutated CBF-AML patients usually have higher baseline white blood cell count, higher relapse rate and shorter event free survival/overall survival after conventional chemotherapy than those without c-KIT mutation. It is conceived that c-KIT mutation is a crucial hit and cooperates with AML1-ETO resulting from t(8;21)(q22;q22) to cause overt AML. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor suppressing c-KIT activation, has been used in c-KIT mutated AML, systemic mastocytosis (SM) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). However, c-KIT exon17 D816V mutation, a frequent mutation of CBF-AML and SM, is associated with primary imatinib resistance. 1J373, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which was initially designed as a FLT3 inhibitor but later found to target c-KIT as well. It has been shown to effectively inhibit the proliferation of FLT3-ITD mutated leukemia cell lines, MV4;11 and MOLM-13, both in vitro and in vivo . (unpublished data) Among a series of myeloid leukemia cell lines without FLT3-ITD mutation, including THP-1, HL-60, K562, KG-1, and kasumi-1, the sensitivity to 1J373 is closely associated with the presence of constitutive c-KIT activation ( Figure 1A ). The IC50 of 1J373 for cells with (K562, KG-1 and kasumi-1) and without (THP-1 and HL-60) constitutive c-KIT activation was below 50 nM and beyond 1000 nM, respectively. 1J373 suppressed the phosphorylation of c-KIT for cell lines with constitutively activated c-KIT, which suggested that 1J373 may suppress the proliferation of KG-1, K562, and kasumi-1 by inhibiting c-KIT ( Figure 1B ).We further compared the efficacy of 1J373 and imatinib in kasumi-1, a cell line with t(8;21)/AML1-ETO and c-KIT exon 17 N822K mutation. At 1000nM of concentration, the phosphorylation of c-KIT was effectively inhibited by imatinib at 2-hour but partially recovered after 8 hours; while 1J373 treatment resulted in a sustained inhibition for 24 hours. The inhibition of c-KIT activation by both agents was accompanied with corresponding changes in the phosphorylation status of its downstream signaling pathway molecules, including PI3K, AKT, mTOR, and MAPK ( Figure 2 ). 1J373 induced cell cycle arrest of kasumi-1 at G1 phase with increase of subG1 population time-dependently and induced apoptosis of kasumi-1 through activation of caspase 8 and 9, and upregulation of proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak. The in vivo experiments are in progress. In conclusion, 1J373, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, can effectively inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of c-KIT activated leukemia cells. It has the potential to be used in clinical practice to treat c-KIT driven, particularly c-KIT mutated, AML.
