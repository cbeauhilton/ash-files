    "abstract_text": "The \u201callogeneic effect\u201d refers to the induction of host B cell antibody synthesis or host T cell cytotoxicity, including tumoricidal activity, by an infusion of allogeneic lymphocytes. We have previously shown that treatment of mice with cyclophosphamide (Cy) followed by infusion of CD8+ T cell-depleted allogeneic spleen cells (Cy + CD8\u2212 DLI) induces anti-tumor activity in a model of minimal residual leukemia, even though the donor cells are eventually rejected by the host immune system. The purpose of the current investigation was to test the activity of Cy + CD8\u2212 DLI in the treatment of well-established cancer, and to characterize the mechanisms of the anti-tumor effect. BALB/c mice were inoculated intravenously (IV) with the syngeneic A20 lymphoma/leukemia or the RENCA renal cell carcinoma on day 0 and were then treated with nothing, Cy alone on day 14, or Cy + CD8 \u2212 DLI from MHC-mismatched C57BL/6 donors on day 15. In both tumor models, the combination of Cy + CD8 \u2212 DLI significantly prolonged survival compared to mice treated with nothing or with Cy alone. While depletion of CD4+ T cells from the DLI significantly diminished the beneficial effect of CD8\u2212 DLI, purified CD4+ T cells alone were inactive, demonstrating that donor CD4+ T cells and another population of cells were required for optimal anti-tumor activity. Several observations pointed to an active role for the host immune system in the anti-tumor activity of Cy + CD8\u2212 DLI. First, host T cells participated in the anti-tumor effect of treatment with Cy alone, since the drug\u2019s activity was diminished in tumor-bearing scid mice or in normal BALB/c mice depleted of T cells. Second, while Cy + CD8\u2212 DLI caused no GVHD in tumor-bearing but immunocompetent BALB/c recipients, it caused fatal acute GVHD in either tumor-bearing scid or T-cell depleted BALB/c mice. Finally, the anti-tumor effect of Cy + CD8- DLI was also significantly inhibited in BALB/c mice that were depleted of CD8+ T cells. These results demonstrate that transiently engrafting T cells administered after Cy can induce significant anti-tumor effects against both solid and liquid tumors. We propose that upon recognition of alloantigen on host antigen-presenting cells (APCs), allogeneic donor CD4 + T cells deliver activating ligands to the APCs, thereby generating effective \u201chelp\u201d to break tolerance in tumor-specific host CD8+ T cells. This mechanism may correspond to the \u201callogeneic effect\u201d in the anti-tumor response described over three decades ago.",
