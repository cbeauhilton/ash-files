    "abstract_text": "Anemia in the elderly is frequently unrecognized and untreated. Anemia prevalence increases with age and has been reported to occur in >20% of elderly persons. Anemia has also been shown to be a significant and independent predictor of mortality. There are no published data, however, regarding prevalence of anemia or its association with mortality in an elderly Asian-American population. In this study, we examined the relationship between hemoglobin (Hb) and mortality in elderly Asian-American men in the Honolulu Heart Program (HHP). The HHP began in 1965 following a cohort of 8006 Asian-American men aged 45-68 living on Oahu, Hawaii. These men have been followed for over 40 years(y). The present analysis is based on 14 years of follow-up for mortality events beginning at examinations that were given from 1991\u20131993 when the men were aged 71-93y. Anemia (Hb5y and after adjustment for other risk factors. There was a significant (p<0.001) inversed J-shaped relationship with a minimum in mortality incidence occurring when Hb was 15.5g/dL. The corresponding 95% CI (15\u201315.9g/dL) was used as a reference for comparing rates of mortality with other Hb ranges. Compared to this latter group, there was a 2.4-fold excess in mortality (95% CI, 1.8\u20133.1) in men with a Hb<12g/dL (p<0.001). For men with Hb \u226517g/dL, there was a 1.3\u2013fold excess (95% CI, 1.2\u20131.6). The latter, however, was not significant after excluding former and current smokers. These results are the first to describe prevalence of anemia in elderly Asian-American men. These findings indicate anemia is a strong independent predictor of mortality in this elderly population with the risk similar to that reported from other studies of the elderly.",
