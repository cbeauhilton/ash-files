    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Uncontrolled complement activation plays a pivotal role in a variety of disorders such as PNH and aHUS. ALN-CC5 is a subcutaneous (SC) investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting complement C5 (C5). In preclinical studies, ALN-CC5 has demonstrated decreased terminal complement activity. Based on the literature, preventing the generation of the terminal complex protects against intravascular hemolysis and complement-mediated tissue damage. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ALN-CC5 in normal healthy volunteers. Material and methods: A multi-centered, placebo controlled, double blind phase 1 clinical study in healthy volunteers is ongoing. Several cohorts of healthy volunteers in Part A, a single ascending dose study and Part B, a weekly multiple ascending dose study have been completed. Primary endpoints are safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints are pharmacokinetics, reduction of circulating C5, reduction in hemolytic, CAP and CCP activity. Results: In Part A, 20 healthy volunteers were randomized (1:3) to placebo or single SC dose of 50, 200, 400, 600 or 900mg of ALN-CC5 and followed for at least 70 days. In Part B, 12 healthy volunteers were randomized (1:3) to placebo or 5 weekly doses of 100, 200 or 400mg of ALN-CC5. No SAEs or study discontinuations occurred and overall ALN-CC5 was considered safe and generally well tolerated. A dose dependent and 94% mean maximum C5 knockdown was achieved following weekly administration. Updated safety and tolerability data as well as C5 knockdown, and changes in CAP, CCP and hemolytic activity from the study will be presented. Conclusion : Collectively, these initial results suggest that the use of a novel RNAi therapeutic targeting C5 is a promising approach for inhibiting complement in PNH, aHUS and other complement-mediated diseases. The subcutaneous route of administration and infrequent dosing make this a potentially encouraging therapy. Disclosures Hill: Alnylam: Consultancy.
