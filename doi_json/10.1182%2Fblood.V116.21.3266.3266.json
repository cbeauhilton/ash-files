    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3266 Previous studies have demonstrated interactions between histone deacetylase (HDAC) and proteasome inhibitors (PIs) in multiple myeloma, NHL, and CLL. However, exploration of this strategy in acute leukemias has been more limited. In this context, we have previously demonstrated that HDACIs activate the cytoprotective NF-\u03baB pathway in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, and that interruption of this process dramatically increases lethality. Such findings raise the possibility that PIs, which block degradation of the NF-\u03baB-inhibitory protein I\u03baB\u03b1, may act via an analogous mechanism in acute leukemias. Consequently, interactions between the clinically relevant pan-HDAC inhibitor belinostat (PXD-101) and the FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor bortezomib were evaluated in both continuously cultured cell lines and primary AML and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) samples. First, whereas each agent individually displayed only modest toxicity, co-treatment for 24 hr or 48 hr with low concentrations of bortezomib (3 - 5 nM) and belinostat (50 - 300 nM) led to pronounced increases in apoptosis in diverse human acute leukemia cell lines (e.g., AML, U937, HL-60, MV-4-11/Flt3-ITD; T-cell ALL, Jurkat; B-cell ALL, SEM). Interactions between these agents were determined to be synergistic by Median Dose Effect analysis. Significantly, equivalent interactions were observed in multiple primary AML (n = 4) and ALL (n = 3) blast specimens, while largely sparing normal CD34 + hematopoietic cells isolated from umbilical cord blood (n = 4), as determined by annexin V/PI, DiOC 6 , and/or 7-AAD uptake by flow cytometry. Western blot analysis demonstrated that co-exposure of primary leukemia blasts to bortezomib and belinostat resulted in marked increase in PARP cleavage, compared with each agent administrated alone. In addition, cell morphology exhibited classical features of apoptosis in primary acute leukemia blasts, but not in normal CD34 + cells, following combination treatment. Second, in both cell lines and primary blasts, administration of bortezomib resulted in accumulation of the phosphorylated (S32/S36) form of I\u03baB\u03b1, accompanied by diminished belinostat-mediated hyperacetylation (K310) of RelA/p65. Bortezomib also blocked processing of the precursor p100 into the active p52, an event enhanced by co-treatment with belinostat. These results indicate that a regimen combining bortezomib and belinostat interrupts both canonical and non-canonical NF-\u03baB signaling pathways in acute leukemia cells. Moreover, co-exposure to these agents diminished expression of NF-\u03baB-dependent pro-survival proteins including Bcl-xL, XIAP, and SOD2, but not NF-\u03baB-independent anti-apoptotic proteins such as survivin. Third, because the BH3-only Bcl-2 family pro-apoptotic protein Bim plays an important role in the lethality of PIs or HDACIs as single agents, the expression and functional role of Bim in bortezomib/belinostat interactions was examined. Notably, whereas treatment with marginally toxic concentrations of either agent alone clearly increased Bim protein levels, co-exposure of either leukemia cell lines or primary blasts to bortezomib and belinostat led to sharply increased Bim expression (particularly the BimEL isoform). Importantly, shRNA knock-down of Bim substantially attenuated lethality mediated by co-treatment with bortezomib and belinostat in both AML (U937) and ALL (Jurkat) cells, supporting the notion that up-regulation of Bim plays a critical role in anti-leukemic activity of the combination regimen. Lastly, exposure of cultured leukemia cells and primary blasts to belinostat \u00b1 bortezomib induced hyperacetylation of a-tubulin, indicating inhibition of HDAC6, a microtubule-associated deacetylase that regulates aggresome formation and cell survival in response to misfolded protein-induced stress. Together, these findings indicate that the regimen combining belinostat and bortezomib is highly active against human AML and ALL cells, including primary leukemic blasts, in association with perturbation in the balance between pro-survival (NF-\u03baB-dependent) and pro-death (e.g., Bim) signals. They also suggest that this strategy warrants further attention in acute leukemias. Accordingly, a Phase I trial of belinostat and bortezomib in patients with refractory acute leukemia or MDS has recently been initiated.
