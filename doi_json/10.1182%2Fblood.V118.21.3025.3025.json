    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3025 Introduction: Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is the only curative treatment for MM, it is associated to a high morbility and mortality. Moreover, relapses are common after allo-RIC. Accordingly, new strategies are required to reduce both the risk of relapse and the toxicity of the procedure. As we have previously demonstrated, Bz induces a selective depletion of alloreactive T-cells and has immunomodulatory properties which might be of potential benefit for GVHD control. The primary end point of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of allo-RIC in terms of response when Bz was added as part of a reduced intensity conditioning prior to allo-SCT. Secondary end points included incidence of GVHD and analysis of the toxicity of the procedure when Bz is also administered post-infussion as part of the GVHD prophylaxis. Method: Prior to allo-RIC, patients received two cycles of Bz plus dexamethasone. Conditioning consisted of fludarabine (30 mg/m 2 intravenously on days -9 to -5) and melphalan (70 mg/m 2 intravenously on days -4, -3) plus Bz 1, 3mg/m 2 on day - 11 and -2. GVHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine (CsA) and methotrexate for the first 9 patients and CsA plus MTX and Bz on days +3 and +7 for the remaining 7 patients. From day +50 post allo-RIC 7 cycles of Bz (+1, +8, +15) were administered, the first two cycles every 28 days and the rest every 56. Results: 16 patients from the Twenty-one initially enrolled, were evaluable. All 16 patients had received at least 2 lines of therapy including autologous-SCT. Disease status was CR or nCR in 4 patients, 9 had PR and the remaining 3 patients had relapsed / progressive disease. 15 patients maintained or improved status at transplant including all \u00d7 patients with active disease at transplant. Eight patients (50%) relapsed, four with extramedullary involvement. No patient developed grade 4 aGVHD.Grades 2\u20133 aGVHD occurred in 6 patients (37%). Interestingly, two out of the nine (29%) patients who received Bz on days +3 and 7 developed grades 2\u20133 acute GVHD as compared to four of the nine (44%) who did not receive it. In terms of toxicity, one patient did not achieve platelet engraftment and 2 patients developed peripheral neuropathy requiring treatment withdrawal. 8 patients died, four of them due to relapse (MRT: 25%). With a median follow-up of 457 days overall survival was 46%. Conclusions: The current trial is the first evaluating the efficacy and safety of Bz as part of a reduced intensity conditioning regimen among patients with high risk MM undergoing allogeneic transplantation. Regarding the efficacy of the procedure all but one patient improved disease status post-alloRIC although relapse rate was still high in this heavily pretreated population. In addition, Bz post-alloSCT is well tolerated and may decrease the incidence of GVHD. Disclosures: Perez-Simo\u0301n: Janssen-Cilag: Patents & Royalties.
