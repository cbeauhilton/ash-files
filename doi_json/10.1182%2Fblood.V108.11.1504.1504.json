    "abstract_text": "Integrins reside on cell surfaces in an equilibrium between inactive and active conformations. When inactive, the transmembrane (TM) domains of integrin \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits interact, but the domains separate when integrins assume their active conformation. Although this conformational change has not been shown for \u03b1v\u03b23, we hypothesized that a peptide designed to bind to the \u03b1v TM domain might activate \u03b1v\u03b23 in platelets by disrupting the TM domain heterodimer of the inactive molecule. To design such a peptide, we used CHAMP (Computed Helical Anti-Membrane Protein) methodology. In the CHAMP method, the \u03b1v TM helix was scanned for motifs likely to mediate \u03b1v\u03b23 TM domain interactions. Next, the backbone conformation for an \u03b1v-binding peptide was selected based on known structural preferences for the motifs identified in the \u03b1v helix. Finally, the sequence for the peptide was designed computationally using a side-chain repacking algorithm. The CHAMP peptide, anti-\u03b1v, and its TM helix target, \u03b1v-TM, were synthesized by solid phase synthesis. We also synthesized anti-\u03b1vmut in which the putative anti-\u03b1v-TM binding motif, GXXXG, was mutated to LXXXL. Lys2 dipeptides and short polyethylene glycol sequences were appended to the C- and N-termini of the peptides, respectively, to facilitate their solubility and insertion into membranes. CD spectroscopy revealed that both anti-\u03b1v and \u03b1v-TM were helical in micelles and phospholipid vesicles. Measurement of Trp fluorescence intensity revealed that anti-\u03b1v rapidly inserted into unilamellar POPC/POPG vesicles. Analytical ultracentrifuge and fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments demonstrated that anti-\u03b1v bound to the \u03b1v-TM, but not to a homologous \u03b1IIb-TM domain peptide. In addition, there was negligible interaction between \u03b1v-TM and anti-\u03b1vmut. Anti-\u03b1v also formed heteromeric complexes with the \u03b1v TM domain in bacterial membranes but not with the TM domains of \u03b1IIb, \u03b12, \u03b21, or \u03b23. \u03b1v\u03b23 mediates the adhesion of agonist-stimulated platelets to the matrix protein osteopontin (OPN). We found that anti-\u03b1V at \u03bcM concentrations induced platelet adhesion to OPN. Adhesion was prevented by the divalent cation chelator EDTA, consistent with an integrin-mediated process, but was only minimally affected by pre-incubating the platelets with PGE1, implying that anti-\u03b1v-induced adhesion by interacting directly with the \u03b1v TM domain. Force spectroscopy using laser tweezers confirmed the specificity of the interaction of anti-\u03b1v with platelets: anti-\u03b1v induced specific rupture forces between platelets and OPN-coated beads, but not between platelets and fibrinogen-coated beads. Moreover, only non-specific rupture forces were detected between OPN-coated beads and platelets incubated with anti-\u03b1vmut. These results demonstrate the successful application of computational methods to design a soluble peptide that specifically recognizes the TM domain of \u03b1v in platelets membranes, even when a 400-fold excess of the homologous integrin subunit \u03b1IIb is present. Further, because the peptide binds to the site on the \u03b1v TM domain that interacts with the \u03b23 TM helix and activates \u03b1v\u03b23, these results strongly support the hypothesis that separation of the \u03b1v and \u03b23 TM domains regulates the function of this integrin.",
