    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1975 Background: Among patients with AML with normal cytogenetics (CN-AML), the presence or absence of the NPM1 mutation ( NPM1 mut ) and the FLT3 internal tandem duplication ( FLT3 -ITD) allows to define molecular subgroups, which proved to influence leukemia-free survival (LFS) both after chemotherapy and allo-SCT (Schlenk, NEJM 2008, Brunet, JCO 2012). Hence, the genotypes are currently used as \u201cdisease risk\u201d criteria, especially to define indication for allo-SCT in CR1. The influence of these markers on overall survival (OS) after allo-SCT has not been evaluated so far. Methods: An EBMT registry-based analysis included adults fulfilling the following criteria: CN-AML, peripheral blood stem cell or bone marrow allo-SCT in CR1 between 2006 and 2011, using matched-related (MRD) or matched unrelated donor (MUD), and detailed information on the mutational status of NPM1 and FLT3 -ITD being available. OS, LFS, relapse incidence (RI) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were calculated according to molecular subgroups. Further, a multivariate Cox model for risk factors was applied, including the following, predefined variables: Age (<> median), white blood cell counts at diagnosis, time from diagnosis to CR1, donor type (MRD versus MUD), conditioning regimen (reduced versus standard) and presence or absence of NPM1 mut and FLT3 -ITD. Results: 366 patients (median age: 49.5 years, range 18.0\u201370.6; 49% males, MRD in 54%) were included. Median time from diagnosis to CR1 was 45 days (range: 7\u2013181), and median time from CR1 to allo-SCT was 109 days (range: 11\u2013308). Median follow-up from allo-SCT was 12 months (range: 1\u201361). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of 2-year OS and LFS for the entire cohort were 69\u00b13% and 62\u00b13%, the cumulative incidence of relapse and NRM were 23\u00b12% and 14\u00b12%. Presence of an NPM1 mut had no influence on LFS or OS. In contrast, presence of an FLT3 -ITD was strongly associated with increased RI (p=0.0004), and decreased LFS (p=0.004) and OS (p=0.0007). Results at 2 years from allo-SCT (% +/\u2212 SD) according to molecular subgroups are shown in the table below ( mut , mutated, WT , wild type):  . OS . LFS . RI . NRM . NPM1 WT / FLT3 -ITDneg (n=143) 78 \u00b1 5 68 \u00b1 5 15 \u00b1 4 17 \u00b1 4 NPM1 WT / FLT3 -ITD (n=33) 54 \u00b1 12 54 \u00b1 11 29 \u00b1 11 17 \u00b1 8 NPM1 mut / FLT3 -ITD (n=162) 60 \u00b1 5 56 \u00b1 5 31 \u00b1 4 12 \u00b1 3 NPM1 mut / FLT3 -ITDneg (n=28) 87 \u00b1 7 77 \u00b1 10 14 \u00b1 8 9 \u00b1 6 . OS . LFS . RI . NRM . NPM1 WT / FLT3 -ITDneg (n=143) 78 \u00b1 5 68 \u00b1 5 15 \u00b1 4 17 \u00b1 4 NPM1 WT / FLT3 -ITD (n=33) 54 \u00b1 12 54 \u00b1 11 29 \u00b1 11 17 \u00b1 8 NPM1 mut / FLT3 -ITD (n=162) 60 \u00b1 5 56 \u00b1 5 31 \u00b1 4 12 \u00b1 3 NPM1 mut / FLT3 -ITDneg (n=28) 87 \u00b1 7 77 \u00b1 10 14 \u00b1 8 9 \u00b1 6 View Large In the multivariate Cox model, age above the median of 49.5 years was the only factor associated with increased NRM (HR= 3.15, 95%CI: 1.27\u20137.82, p=0.01), whereas FLT3 -ITD was the only factor that correlated with RI (HR=2.80; 95%CI; 1.26\u20136.20, p=0.01). Both older age and presence of FLT3 -ITD were significantly associated with inferior LFS (HR=1.73, 95%CI: 1.03\u20132.91, p=0.04 for age, HR=2.03, 95%CI: 1.13\u20133.65, p=0.02 for FLT3 -ITD) and, most importantly, with decreased OS (HR=2.29; 95%CI: 1.27\u20134.15, p=0.006 for age, and HR=2,75; 95%CI: 1.41\u20135.34, p=0.003 for FLT3 -ITD). The latter data allowed the development of a scoring system, identifying three prognostic groups with 2-year survival rates of 42+/\u22127% (patients with both older age and FLT3 -ITD), 66+/\u22124% (older age or FLT3 -ITD) and 74+/\u22127% (younger age and FLT3 -ITDneg, p<0.0001), respectively. Conclusion: We conclude that older age and FLT3 -ITD are major risk factors for OS after allo-SCT in CN-AML patients in CR1, independently from other factors such as donor type, intensity of the conditioning, or NPM1 mutational status.
