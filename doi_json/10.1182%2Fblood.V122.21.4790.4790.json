    "abstract_text": "FTo investigate the molecular mutation leading to Hemophilia B in one patient. Methods FOne-stage method was used to detect APTT, PT, TT, Fibrinogen and FVIII:C, FIX:C. The genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of proband. All exons and their flanks of Factor IX gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were sequenced directly. Results FThe proband was a 20-month boy presenting with scalp hematoma after trauma. Regular coagulation tests showed that his APTT was 135.1s, PT 11.9s, TT 15.6s and Fibrinogen 2g/l. Normal mixed plasma could correct the prolonged APTT to 35s. His FIX:C was 6.4% and FVIII:C was normal. Direct sequencing of PCR products suggested that there was a 5085T>C mutation (NG_007994.1) in Exon1, and a 36060G>C mutation in Exon8 of F9 gene. The former mutation caused the substitution of Leu19 by Pro, which lies in -28 th in signal peptide. The later mutation lead to the substituion of Gln370 by His. Conclusion FMutations of 5085T>C in Exon1 and 36060G>C in Exon8 might be the causes of coagulation factor IX defiency for the patient. These mutations are de novo ones according to the database presenting in http://www.factorix.org/ . Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
