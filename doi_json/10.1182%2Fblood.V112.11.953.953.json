    "abstract_text": "Acute leukemia in adults continues to be a formidable clinical challenge that demands further investigation to identify more rational therapies. To optimize anti-leukemia therapy, we are investigating the prototypical cyclin dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor, flavopiridol, in refractory or poor-risk disease. Flavopiridol is a cytotoxic molecule that is thought to induce cell cycle arrest by blocking cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) function, thereby interfering with RNA Polymerase II activity and globally down-regulating gene expression. In the setting of pan-cdk inhibition, E2F1 is released and appears to drive apoptosis in transformed cells. Consistent with these proposed mechanisms of action, a previous study from our group showed that flavopiridol induces apoptosis in vitro in leukemic blasts from patients with refractory leukemia. Administration of flavopiridol was associated with a decrease in one or more of the following proteins in the leukemic blasts: RNA Polymerase II, STAT3, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1. Serum VEGF levels also decreased in most patients. We are now investigating mRNA levels of the genes encoding these proteins by quantitative, RT-PCR in leukemic blasts from adult patients with refractory or poor-risk leukemia before and after flavopiridol therapy. We have treated 26 patients with flavopiridol at an escalating, hybrid dose followed by ara-c and mitxantrone. Adequate RNA from leukemic blasts before and after flavopiridol administration was available from 8 of 11 patients studied thus far. All cases (8/8) exhibit a marked decrease in mRNA for VEGF following flavopiridol. mRNA levels for other putative flavopiridol target genes is also decreased in a subset of leukemic blast samples after therapy, as follows: E2F1 (6/8), STAT3 (6/8), Mcl-1 (6/8), RNA Polymerase subunit 2a (3/3), and cyclin D1 (2/3). In contrast, bcl-2 mRNA levels increased after flavopiridol in most cases (7/8), which could represent a compensatory mechanism of leukemic blasts to avoid apoptotic cell death. Our preliminary studies indicate that flavopiridol is cytotoxic in poor-risk and refractory acute leukemia. Studies are underway to determine if down-regulation of any putative target genes correlates with pharmacologic data or clinical responses.",
