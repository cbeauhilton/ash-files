    "abstract_text": "Chemerin is a potent chemoattractant for cells that express the serpentine receptor CMKLR1 (chemokine-like receptor 1), such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells and tissue macrophages. Chemerin circulates in the blood in a relatively inactive form (prochemerin). Its chemotactic activity is unleashed following proteolytic cleavage of carboxyl-terminal amino acids by serine proteases including plasmin, factor XIIa and VIIa. Recruitment of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and macrophages by chemerin may play a role in local tissue immune and inflammatory responses. The shortest bioactive chemerin peptide NH2-YFPGQFAFS-COOH (9mer) is present in the carboxyl-terminal domain. In this work, we show that plasma carboxypeptidase N (CPN) and B (CPB or activated thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa)) (30 nM) remove the C-terminal lysine (K) from YFPGQFAFSK (10mer) (200nM) and enhance the migration of CMKLR1-transfected cells by \u223c16-fold. To investigate if sequential proteolysis by plasmin and carboxypeptidases can modulate the activity of chemerin peptides, we generated the carboxyl-terminal 15mer of prochemerin, NH2-YFPGQFAFSKALPRS-COOH. Plasmin cleavage (1 \u03bcM) generated a 10mer, which was further processed to 9mer by CPN or CPB (30 nM) cleavage. These sequential cleavages were paralleled by corresponding increases in chemotactic activity. At concentrations as high as 1 \u03bcM the 15 mer did not induce chemotaxis; after plasmin cleavage and conversion to 10mer, however, significant chemotactic activity was demonstrated. Treatment with CPN or CPB further enhanced this chemotactic activity. We observed a similar enhancement in bioactivity following sequential plasmin/CPN-or-CPB cleavage of full-length prochemerin. Endogenous plasma CPN supports the activation (\u223c2.5 fold increase in bioactivity) of plasmin-cleaved prochemerin (0.2 nM). This activation was blocked by incubating plasma with MGTA (DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid), a specific CPN inhibitor. In addition, we show that platelets are a rich source of chemerin (20\u201330 ng of chemerin/5x10 8 platelets). Chemerin released from activated platelets triggers CMKLR1-transfectant chemotaxis, which was blocked by anti-chemerin antibodies. Thus, the circulating humoral factors reported here (platelets, serine proteases, and carboxypeptidases) may contribute to the regulation of chemerin bioactivity in vivo and therefore play a critical role in CMKLR1-mediated immune responses.",
