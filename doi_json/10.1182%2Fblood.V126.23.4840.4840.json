    "abstract_text": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) is a complicated cytokine which could induce differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. We have found that Oroxylin A, a natural compound isolated from Scutellariae radix, markedly enhanced TNF\u03b1-induced NBT reduction and CD11b/CD14 expression of AML cells. Besides, Giemsa staining also displayed that the combination group induced U937-MDR cells to differentiate into monocyte-like cells yet NB4 and HL-60-resistant cells to granulocytic-like cells. Further study showed that TNF\u03b1 induced PI3K subunit p85\u03b1 binding to N-terminal truncated nuclear receptor RXR\u03b1 (tRXR\u03b1) proteins and activating AKT. On the contrary, these could be inhibited by Oroxylin A through inhibiting interaction between tRXR\u03b1 and p85\u03b1 in NB4 and HL-60-resistant cells. Moreover, Oroxylin A inhibited the activation of NF-\u03baB signaling and the DNA binding activity by TNF\u03b1 proved by EMSA in these two AML cells. All these suggested that Oroxylin A was able to inhibit NF-\u03baB signaling and RXR\u03b1-dependent AKT signaling, the negative effects of TNF\u03b1 for AML therapy, suggesting that combination of Oroxylin A and TNF\u03b1 might be a novel candidate for differentiation therapy for AML cells and required further investigation.
