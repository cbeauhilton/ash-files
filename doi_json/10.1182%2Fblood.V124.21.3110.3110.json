    "abstract_text": "The addition of rituximab to front-line therapy regimens in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has greatly improved clinical outcomes, but is also associated with a disease that is more resistant to salvage chemotherapy in the second-line setting, reinforcing the need for new therapies targeted at the overlapping resistance pathways between rituximab and chemotherapy. To better understand the mechanisms responsible for rituximab/chemotherapy cross-resistance we developed several rituximab resistance cell lines which exhibited significant concurrent chemotherapy resistance. These multi-therapy resistant cell lines (TRCL) exhibit decreased expression of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bak and Bak, along with over-expression of several anti-apoptotic proteins, including the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) survivin and livin (determined by Western blot). High IAP expression has been associated with inferior clinical outcomes in a range of hematological malignancies, and solid tumors. To determine the impact of IAP over-expression on TRCL rituximab/chemotherapy resistance we utilized a transient siRNA knockdown of both survivn and livin. TRCLs with livin knockdown had a statistically significant improvement in response to several chemotherapy agents including doxorubicin, vincristine, and the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib (measured at 48 hours with the Cell Titer-Glo viability assay). These results support livin over-expression as a key lymphoma therapy resistance mechanism, and establish IAPs as potential therapeutic targets. Small molecule IAP inhibitors, like LCL-161 (obtained from Novartis), are chemical mimetics of the endogenous IAP antagonist termed the second mitochondrial inhibitor of caspases (SMAC). Western blot analysis indicated that TRCLs treated in vitro with LCL-161 exhibited a dose dependent decrease in the expression of several IAPs, including livin. In addition, LCL-161 increased rates of TRCL apoptosis, and produced synergistic anti-tumor activity when combined with cytarabine, gemcitabine, and carfilzomib in vitro . LCL-161 also enhanced the ex vivo anti-tumor activity of carfilzomib against primary tumor cells isolated from lymphoma patients with both de novo, and relapse/refractory disease. Cell viability and apoptosis induction were determined at 48 hours with CellTiter-Glo viability assays and flow cytometry respectively. To evaluate the anti-tumor effect of LCL-161 in vivo severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice were inoculated with the TRCL Raji-4RH via tail vein injection (iv), and assigned to observation or treatment arms 7 days after inoculation. Treatments were LCL-161 alone (60mg/kg), the combination of rituximab: 10mg/kg, gemcitabine: 120mg/kg, and vinorelbine: 8mg/kg (RGV), or LCL-161 and RGV together. LCL-161 was administered on day 7 as one dose given p.o. by gavage; RGV was also administered on day 7 as a single i.v. dose given by tail vein injection. Differences in survival (measured as the time to the development of limb paralysis) were evaluated with the Log-rank, Breslow, and Tarone-Ware tests across treatment arms. As a single agent LCL-161 was ineffective in controlling Raji-4RH tumor growth in vivo . However, the combination of LCL-161 with RGV (median survival 133 days) resulted in a statistically significant (P=0.002 with each test) improvement in overall survival when compared to RGV alone (median survival 53 days). In summary, IAPs, especially livin, contribute to rituximab/chemotherapy resistance in relapse/refractory B-cell lymphoma models. However, the IAP inhibitor LCL-161 can disrupt this resistance and augment the effect of chemotherapy in resistant lymphoma cell line models, as well as relapse/refractory lymphoma patient samples. In addition, LCL-161 can improve the anti-tumor activity of the RGV chemotherapy regimen, and increase overall survival in a mouse in vivo model of human rituximab/chemotherapy resistant lymphoma. Our data supports the continued investigation of LCL-161 as a novel and effective targeted agent for the treatment of aggressive rituximab relapse/refractory B-cell lymphomas.
