    "abstract_text": "Bosutinib (BOS), an oral dual Src/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), showed clinical activity and manageable toxicity in an open-label, phase 1/2 trial in patients (pts) with chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) following resistance (R)/intolerance (I) to imatinib (IM) only (2 nd line; CP2L) or to IM plus dasatinib (D) and/or nilotinib (N) (3 rd /4 th line; CP3L). In this retrospective analysis, a major cytogenetic response (MCyR) by 3 or by 6 mo (but not by 3 mo) was assessed as a predictor of long-term outcomes in CP2L or CP3L pts receiving BOS. CP-CML pts aged \u226518 y received BOS starting at 500 mg/d. MCyR and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rates and maintenance of MCyR were assessed in CP2L pts at 4 y and CP3L pts at 3 y. Pts with MCyR newly attained or maintained from baseline by 3 mo, by >3 to \u22646 mo (but not by 3 mo), or no MCyR by 6 mo were assessed for overall survival (OS) at 2 y (all pts) and cumulative incidence of progression (including lack of efficacy)/death at 4 y (CP2L) or 3 y (CP3L), adjusted for competing risks (see Table ). OS rates were limited to 2 y (pts were followed for only 2 y from BOS discontinuation). P values were based on Gray's test for comparison of cumulative incidence distributions and log-rank test for OS distributions (no adjustment for multiple comparisons). Table.  . MCyR by 3 mo .

View Large CP2L pts (n=286 [IM-R, n=196; IM-I, n=90]) had a median (range) age of 53 (18\u201391) y. CP3L pts (n=118 with prior IM failure [D-R, n=38; D-I, n=50; N-R, n=26; N-I or D-R/I + N-R/I, n=4]) had a median (range) age of 56 (20\u201379) y. Median time from CML diagnosis was 3.7 (0.1\u201315.1) and 6.6 (0.6\u201318.3) y for CP2L and CP3L pts, respectively; BOS treatment duration was 24.8 (0.2\u201383.4) and 8.5 (0.2\u201378.1) mo; follow-up duration was 47.3 (0.6\u201390.6) and 33.1 (0.3\u201384.8) mo. Time from last enrolled pt's first dose to database snapshot was \u226548 mo for CP2L and \u226536 mo for CP3L. Of 264 CP2L pts with a valid baseline assessment, 107/183 (58%) IM-R and 49/81 (60%) IM-I pts attained/maintained a MCyR; 88/183 (48%) and 42/81 (52%) pts had CCyR. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) probability of maintaining MCyR at 4 y was 69% for IM-R and 86% for IM-I pts. Of 110 CP3L pts with valid assessment, overall MCyR and CCyR rates were 40% and 32%; the KM probability of maintaining MCyR at 3 y was 65%. There was no significant difference in OS or cumulative incidence of progression/death distribution between CP2L pts with MCyR by 3 mo vs by >3 to \u22646 mo; however, OS ( P =0.0004) and cumulative incidence of progression/death ( P =0.0002) distributions were significantly better for CP2L pts with MCyR by 3 mo vs no MCyR by 6 mo ( Table ). For CP3L pts, there was no significant difference in long-term outcomes between early response groups. In conclusion, in CP-CML pts receiving BOS as 2 nd -line therapy following IM failure (CP2L), pts who attained/maintained a MCyR by 3 mo had better OS and a lower progression/death distribution vs pts without MCyR by 6 mo; no significant differences were observed between pts achieving MCyR by 3 mo vs by >3 to \u22646 mo, although pt number was low for late responders. There were no significant differences in outcomes for CP-CML pts receiving BOS as 3 rd /4 th -line therapy, regardless of when or if MCyR was achieved, although the number of pts with MCyR was low. These results suggest that pts not achieving a MCyR by 6 mo, particularly in the 2nd-line setting, may require alternative therapies if options with better likelihood of response are available.
