    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1196 c-Myb is a transcription factor essential for the proliferation of hematopoietic cells: conventional c-myb deficient mice died around E14 when their hematopoietic progenitors/stem cells fail to proliferate in the fetal livers. Recently, c-myb has also been reported to be crucial for the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors. We have previously reported that the differentiation into erythrocytes, megakaryocytes and B-lymphocytes is regulated by c-myb levels utilizing ES cell in vitro differentiation combined with a tetracycline-inducible gene expression system. The gene-altered c-myb mice, such as knockdown or conditional knockout mice in the hematopoietic cell lineages, showed that c-myb controlled hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In order to examine the levels of the c-Myb protein in HSCs, we established c-Myb reporter mice in which the EGFP cDNA was linked to the coding sequence of the c-myb gene (c-MybEGFP). Homozygous c-MybEGFP mice, showing normal hematopoiesis, expressed EGFP in hematopoietic progenitors. EGFP + cells were observed in most long-term (LT) HSCs (90\u201395%), which were defined as CD34 \u2212 Lin \u2212 Sca-1 + c-Kit high cells (34LSKs), CD150 + CD48 \u2212 LSKs and side-population LSKs. To evaluate c-Myb function in LT-HSCs, we transplanted 100 cells of EGFP low and EGFP high of 34LSKs into irradiated mice along with competitor cells (0\u00d710 6 cells). Both LT-HSC populations presented multilineage repopulating capacity over 20 weeks. In addition, the EGFP low cells indicated higher chimerism in the total peripheral blood than the EGFP high cells at any given time point. The contribution of the EGFP low -derived cells in the peripheral blood of the recipient mice increased over time whereas EGFP high progeny gradually decreased over time. Under a stringent transplantation condition (30 donor cells with 0.4\u00d710 6 competitor cells), 83.3% of the recipients that received the EGFP low 34LSK showed donor-derived progeny while the EGFP high were lower (20.0%) 8 weeks after transplantation. At Week 12, all the recipients with the EGFP low 34LSKs demonstrated donor-derived progeny; however, EGFP high 34LSKs-derived cells disappeared totally in all the transplants. These results suggest that the EGFP low and the EGFP high cells in LT-HSCs possess distinct repopulating capacity: the EGFP low cells are high and the EGFP high cells are low. To investigate the relationship between the EGFP low and the EGFP high LT-HSC, we examined EGFP expression levels in the recipient mice grafted EGFP low 34KSL at least 24 weeks after transplantation. EGFP low 34LSK generated EGFP high cells in the donor-derived 34LSK population in the recipient mice, suggesting the possibility that the EGFP low LT-HSCs support the production of the EGFP high LT-HSCs. In conclusion, we found that the expression levels of c-Myb protein subdivide LT-HSC population in correspondence with their respective multilineage repopulating capacities.
