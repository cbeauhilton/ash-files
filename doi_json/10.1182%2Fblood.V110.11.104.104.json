    "abstract_text": "Although CEBPA mutations ( CEBPA +) have been reported to predict favorable outcome in CN-AML, their prognostic value has not been evaluated in the context of such established prognostic molecular markers in CN-AML as the combination of FLT3 -ITD and NPM1 mutational status and BAALC and ERG expression. 169 adults aged <60 years (yrs) with untreated, de novo CN-AML, enrolled on CALGB protocols 9621 or 19808 that included autologous stem cell transplantation for consolidation, were analyzed for CEBPA + by DNA PCR amplification/direct sequencing. Testing for BAALC and ERG expression, FLT3 -ITD, FLT3 -TKD, MLL -PTD and NPM1 mutations ( NPM1+ ) was performed centrally in pretreatment marrow or blood samples. Unexpectedly, CEBPA + patients (pts) were more likely to have FLT3 -ITD/ NPM1 high-risk molecular features [ie, FLT3 -ITD+ and/or NPM1 wild-type ( NPM1 wt)] than low-risk molecular features ( FLT3 -ITD-/ NPM1 +; 26 v 3 pts, respectively; P =.001). Thus, we focused subsequent analyses on FLT3 -ITD/ NPM1 high-risk pts (n=109) that included 90% of the CEBPA + pts. In this group, a microarray gene-expression signature of 2,342 probes, 59% of which were downregulated in CEBPA + pts, separated CEBPA + and CEBPA wild-type ( CEBPA wt) pts [false discovery rate (FDR)=.01]. Among the 20 most downregulated probes in CEBPA + pts, 9 corresponded to Homeobox genes ( HOXA3 , A5 , A9 , A10 , B2 , B3 , MEIS1 ). Also downregulated in CEBPA+ pts were other Homeobox genes ( HOXA1 , A2 , A4 , A6 , A7 , B4 , B5 , B6 ), FLT3 , RUNX1 and RAS superfamily members, while CEBPA and GATA1 were upregulated. Additionally, a 13-probe microRNA (miRNA) expression signature distinguished CEBPA + from CEBPA wt pts (FDR=.11). This signature shared features with a previously reported miRNA-signature predictive of clinical outcome in FLT3 -ITD/ NPM1 high-risk CN-AML (Radmacher et al. JCO 2007;25:359s). Eight miRNA probes for miRNA 181 family members were upregulated in CEBPA + pts; an association between miRNA 181 family upregulation and good outcome was a major feature of the previously reported outcome miRNA signature. A probe for miRNA 194, whose downregulation was associated with good outcome in the prior outcome signature, was also downregulated in CEBPA + pts. Consistent with these findings, CEBPA + status predicted better outcome in the FLT3 -ITD/ NPM1 high-risk group. CEBPA + pts had a better event-free survival (EFS) than CEBPA wt pts (P<.0001), with estimated 3-yr EFS rates of 57% and 17%, respectively. In a multivariable analysis, CEBPA + independently predicted longer EFS ( P =.0004; hazard ratio=0.30; 95%CI=0.15\u20130.58), after adjusting for ERG expression ( P =.03). In summary, we report that CN-AML pts with CEBPA + mostly have FLT3 / NPM1 high-risk molecular features, and that the FLT3 / NPM1 high-risk group can be subdivided based on the presence or absence of CEBPA + into 2 subsets characterized by strong gene- and miRNA-expression signatures and different outcome. It is likely that testing for CEBPA + at diagnosis will improve molecular risk-based classification of de novo CN-AML and aid in risk-adapted treatment stratification. Gene- and miRNA-expression profiling may provide insights into disease biology leading to development of novel therapies.",
