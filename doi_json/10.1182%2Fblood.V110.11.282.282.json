    "abstract_text": "Thrombocytopenia and thrombosis following treatment with the glycoprotein \u03b1Iib\u03b23 antagonist, eptifibatide, are rare complications that are thought to be caused by patient antibodies specific for ligand-occupied \u03b1Iib\u03b23. Whether such antibodies induce platelet clearance by simple opsonization, by inducing mild platelet activation, or both, is not well understood. To gain insight into the mechanism by which eptifibatide-dependent antibodies cause platelet clearance, we incubated normal platelets with serum derived from a 73 year old patient who developed profound thrombocytopenia following eptifibatide administration. This patient\u2019s serum was found to contain an \u03b1Iib\u03b23-specific eptifibatide-dependent antibody that induced significant platelet secretion and aggregation in the presence, but not in the absence, of eptifibatide. Interestingly, a number of signaling molecules recently shown to function downstream of integrin engagement, including the integrin \u03b23 cytoplasmic domain, the protein-tyrosine kinase Syk, and phospholipase C\u03b32 (PLC\u03b32) each became tyrosine phosphorylated in platelets subjected to patient serum plus eptifibatide. Because the Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motif (ITAM)-bearing platelet Fc receptor, Fc\u03b3RIIa, plays a prominent role in antibody-induced platelet activation, we examined its role in eptifibatide-induced platelet activation and clearance. We found that (1) Fc\u03b3RIIa became rapidly and strongly tyrosine phosphorylated following incubation of normal platelets with patient serum+eptifibatide and (2) pre-incubation of platelets with Fab fragments of the Fc\u03b3RIIa-specific monoclonal antibody, IV.3, completely blocked both phosphorylation of Fc\u03b3RIIa, Syk, and PLC\u03b32, as well as platelet secretion and aggregation induced by patient serum+eptifibatide. Because amounts of patient sera are often limiting, a model system comprised of the \u03b1Iib\u03b23 complex-specific mAb, AP2, and the ligand mimetic peptide, RGDW was employed, and found to faithfully mimic these reactions. Thus, intact, but not Fab fragments of, AP2 caused tyrosine phosphorylation of Fc\u03b3RIIa, Syk, PLC\u03b32, as well as platelet secretion and aggregation, and these reactions could be completely blocked with Fab fragments of mAb IV.3, further implicating Fc\u03b3RIIa in eptifibatide-induced thrombocytopenia/thrombosis. Finally, to gain further insight into how integrins functionally link to Fc\u03b3RIIa to activate platelets, we subjected platelets from a patient with a variant form of Glanzmann thrombasthenia whose platelets express normal levels of \u03b1Iib\u03b23 and Fc\u03b3RIIa, but lack most of the \u03b23 cytoplasmic domain, to similar treatment. Neither patient serum+eptifibatide nor AP2+RGDW were able to activate this patient\u2019s platelets, implicating the \u03b23 cytoplasmic domain and its associated tyrosine kinases in eptifibatide-induced platelet activation. Taken together, these data suggest a novel mechanism involving both Fc\u03b3RIIa and the cytoplasmic domain of integrin \u03b23 in thrombocytopenia and thrombosis following administration of fibrinogen receptor antagonists.",
