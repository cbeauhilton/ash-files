    "abstract_text": "The prognostic impact of interim positron emission tomography scans (I-PET) for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a matter of debate because its positive predictive value (20\u201380%) is low. Here, we aimed to improve the prognostic impact of I-PET by combining it with interim analysis of serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL2R) levels, the levels of which at the time of diagnosis are associated with the prognosis of DLBCL. We retrospectively examined data from DLBCL patients diagnosed at our institution between January 2006 and October 2013. Patients were included in the analysis if they met all of the following criteria: six or more cycles of rituximab plus CHOP regimen (R-CHOP); I-PET performed after 2-4 cycles of chemotherapy; and sIL2R levels measured after each cycle. Patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, or transformed DLBCL from indolent lymphoma were excluded. I-PET was assessed visually according to the International Harmonization Project criteria. The interim sIL2R (I-IL2) level was defined as the value measured just before the fourth R-CHOP cycle. I-IL2 levels > 800 U/ml, or 2000 U/ml if serum creatinine was > 2.0 mg/dl (sIL2R is influenced by renal function), were regarded as positive. The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS). The unadjusted probabilities of PFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-lank test and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to assess the prognostic values of each clinical variable. In total, 135 patients were enrolled. The median age was 66 years (range, 34\u201389) and 66 patients (48.9%) were male, 27 (20%) had an ECOG performance status >1, 18 (13.3%) had bulky disease, 81 (60%) had advanced disease, and 61 (45.2%) had a high or high-intermediate International Prognostic Index (IPI) score. The median follow-up time was 25.6 months (range, 6.3\u201388.7) and the 2 year progression-free survival rate (2-y PFS) of the entire cohort was 72.9% (95% confidence interval (CI), 63.8\u201380). I-PET and I-IL2 were positive in 47 (34.8%) and 15 (11.1%) patients, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that a high IPI score, a positive I-PET, and a positive I-IL2 had statistically significant poor prognostic effects on PFS, although gender and bulky disease did not. The three significant variables were entered into multivariate analysis, which identified positive I-PET and I-IL2 values (but not IPI) as independently associated with a poor prognosis. The 2-y PFS was 81.8% (95% CI, 70.4\u201389.1) for I-PET-negative and 56.3% (95% CI, 40.7\u201369.3; p<0.001, log rank test) for I-PET positive, respectively. Although a negative I-PET was highly predictive of a favorable outcome, a positive I-PET was of limited clinical value. The 2-y PFS for the 13 patients (9.6%) that were both I-PET- and I-IL2-positive was significantly lower than that of the remaining patients (27.7% [95% CI, 7.1\u201353.6] and 77.7% [95% CI, 68.4\u201384.6], respectively; p<0.001). Patients that were positive for both I-PET and I-IL2, rather than patients that were positive for I-PET alone, had a poor outcome. DLBCL patients that were both I-PET- and I-IL2-positive suffered a high rate of progression; therefore, such patients should be targeted by novel therapeutic approaches. Because the study was based on a retrospective analysis and a limited follow-up period, further studies are needed to confirm the prognostic impact of the combined use of I-PET and I-IL2.
