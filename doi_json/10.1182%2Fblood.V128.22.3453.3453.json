    "abstract_text": "Introduction Multiple myeloma (MM) is a disease of elderly with median age of diagnosis 66-years. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HCT) is recommended for eligible patients with newly diagnosed MM, however, it is not offered to many elderly patients due to concerns of excessive toxicity. We have previously reported that auto-HCT can be safely performed in myeloma patients aged \u2265 70 years (Bashir et al . L&L 2012). Here we report the results of a retrospective analysis of MM patients aged \u2265 75 years who underwent auto-HCT at our center. Methods All myeloma patients aged \u2265 75 years who underwent auto-HCT at our institution between 1/1/2000 and 12/31/2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Frequencies of toxicities were compared using Fisher's exact test. The cumulative incidence (CI) of non-relapse mortality (NRM) was assessed using the competing risks method. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Differences in survival between groups were assessed using the log-rank test. The association between survival and patient subgroups of interest was determined using univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results 72 patients (median age 76 years; 58% male) were included in the study. Thirty percent (n=19/63) were ISS stage I, 43% (n=27/63) were stage II and 27% (n=17/63) stage III. Seventy-eight percent (n=56) were considered standard-risk (IMWG criteria) and 22% (n=16) had high-risk cytogenetics. Sixty-three percent (n=45) received conditioning with melphalan (MEL) 140 mg/m 2 , while 38% (n=27) received MEL >140. Seventy-five percent (n=54) of the patients received auto-HCT as part of first line therapy and 85% (n=61) had at least partial response (PR) at auto-HCT. Median time from diagnosis to auto-HCT was 7.6 months. Half of the patients (n=36) received post transplant maintenance. Median follow-up time for all survivors (n=48) was 25.5 months. Grade II-IV toxicity was seen in 74% (n=53) of patients, gastrointestinal being most common (49% of all patients). There was no difference in toxicity between MEL 140 vs. MEL >140. The median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 11 and 12 days, respectively. The CI of NRM was 1% at Day 100 and 6 months and 4% at the end of the assessment period. Day 100 response rate (at least PR) was 92% (n=66), with 36% (n=26) achieving near complete remission (nCR) or better. Median PFS was 31.4 months (95% CI: 22.6, 36.6, Figure 1). Seventy-five percent of the patients were event free at one year after transplant and 23% were event free at 5 years. Median OS was 72.8 months (95% CI: 45.7, 86.2, Figure 2). The OS rates at 1 year and 5 years post transplant were 93% and 58%, respectively. On multivariable analysis, high-risk cytogenetics and ISS stage III disease were associated with significantly worse PFS and OS. Conclusion Auto-HCT in myeloma patients aged \u2265 75 years is feasible with response rate and survival comparable to that seen in younger patients. Age alone should not be used to determine eligibility for auto-HCT. Figure 1 View large Download slide Progression-free survival (all patients).
