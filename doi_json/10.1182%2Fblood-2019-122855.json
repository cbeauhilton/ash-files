    "abstract_text": "Children with Down syndrome are predisposed to leukemia during the first years of their life. 5-10% of newborns with Down syndrome are born with transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD), which often spontaneously disappears. The majority of these patients achieves complete remission. However, in 20-30% of all TMD patients the disease progress in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. In addition, they have a 20 fold higher risk of developing B-lymphocyte acute leukemia (B-ALL). Leukemic development in Down syndrome is initiated during fetal development. However, it is unclear why fetuses with a trisomy of chromosome 21 have an increased risk of developing leukemia. Previously, we have developed a method to study somatic mutations in single cells using clonal cultures. Here, we applied this method to human fetal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from liver and bone marrow of Down syndrome human fetuses and control fetuses with two copies of chromosome 21 (D21). In addition, we characterized somatic mutation accumulation in not affected small intestine stem cells. Subsequently, we performed in depth mutational analyses to characterize active processes using mutational signatures in fetal stem cells, which potentially can drive leukemic development during early life. Recently, we have shown that that healthy adult HSPCs gradually accumulate somatic mutations in a linear fashion with an annual mutation rate of 14.2 base substitutions per year. Whereas the somatic mutation rate is significantly higher during fetal development. Subsequently, in Down syndrome fetuses the overall somatic mutation rate of fetal stem cells is significantly increased compared to D21 fetal stem cells (P-value: 0,024). We performed phylogenetic analysis to study relatedness of the cells and observed an higher somatic mutation rate in the first cell divisions. This elevated mutation rate can be explained by increased contribution of mutational process signature 1 and 5, which are already present in fetal stem cells. Therefore, Down syndrome fetal stem cells show enhanced activity or increased sensitivity to mutational processes that are normally active during development. The same mutational signatures are present in TMD blast cells, indicating that these processes can cause cancer driver mutations and subsequently contribute to leukemic development. Interestingly, some Down syndrome fetal stem cells showed very high mutation numbers that could partly be attributed to mutational signature 18, which likely reflect oxidative-stress induced mutagenesis. These findings, show increased mutagenesis in Down syndrome during fetal development in hematopoietic stem cells and small intestine stem cells. This increased mutagenesis can potentially explain why children with Down syndrome have an increased risk of developing leukemia in early life.
