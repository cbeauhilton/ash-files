Early studies demonstrated that engraftment times are shorter and predictable if at least 5 \u00d710 6 CD34+ cells/kg are administered following high-dose chemotherapy. However, satisfactory neutrophil and platelet recovery occurs after infusions of >2.0 \u00d710 6 CD34+ cells/kg. Previous analyses demonstrated the presence of different subsets of CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood at different times during mobilization, with pluripotent subsets arising and decreasing earlier after mobilization and more committed subsets peaking later [Stewart et al, Exp Hematol 1995; 23: 1619-27]. We hypothesized that for equivalent CD34+ cell dose, there could be a difference in engraftment kinetics according to the number of days of apheresis required to obtain an adequate PBSC graft. Patients and Methods Data from 270 consecutive autografts performed between July 1999 and April 2006 for non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma (58% and 25%, respectively), breast cancer (8%), germ-cell tumors (2%) and acute myeloid leukemia (7%) were analyzed. Mobilization was performed using cyclophosphamide +/- etoposide + G-CSF 10\u03bcg/kg; patients received G-CSF after PBSC infusion from day 10 until neutrophil recovery >1500/\u03bcL. Patients were stratified in 3 groups according to the SC dose administered as follows: Low-dose (L) <2 \u00d710 6 CD34+ cells/kg, Intermediate-dose (I) 2 to 5 \u00d710 6 CD34+ cells/kg and High-dose (H) >5 \u00d710 6 CD34+ cells/kg and in 2 categories according to the number of days of apheresis performed (\u22642 and 3+). The data analysis was divided in 3 steps. Step 1 : we made a comparison of engraftment results for group L vs. I and I vs. H. Step 2 : to explore potential engraftment differences within each cell dose stratum according to the number of days of apheresis required, that is, I(\u22642) vs. I(3+) and H(\u22642) vs. H(3+). Step 3 : to test the influence of performing additional harvests beyond day 2 on engraftment kinetics we compared group I(\u22642) vs. group H(3+), i.e. those who obtained the optimal number of CD34+ cells through additional collections during the same mobilization. Differences between groups were estimated by the Mann-Whitney test and by Cox regression model. Results The step 1 analysis confirmed that engraftment was faster for the H group (N=138, median 11 days for ANC>500/\u03bcl and N=132, median 11 days for unsupported platelet count >20000/\u03bcl) than for the I group (N=118, median 11 days and N=98, 12 days for neutrophils and platelets, respectively) and the L group (N=14, median 12 days and N=12, median 15 days for neutrophils and platelets, respectively). Two-sided p-values favored I in L vs. I (p=0.0185 for neutrophils and p=0.0013 for platelets) and favored H in I vs. H (p=0.0002 for neutrophils and p=0.019 for platelets). The step 2 analysis did not show any statistical difference in engraftment times within groups L, I and H, according to the number of apheresis (\u22642 vs. 3+), but there was a trend for faster platelet engraftment for patients in the \u22642 group (p=0.08). There was no difference between the \u22642 and 3+ subgroups in terms of age and number of chemotherapy lines received before transplant; although, in the \u22642 group there were more patients with breast cancer (10.3% vs. 4.8%) and Hodgkin lymphoma (32.2% vs. 16.1%) and fewer pts with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (66.1% vs. 48%) compared to the 3+ group (p<0.001). Step 3 analysis showed no difference for neutrophil recovery between subgroups I\u22642 and H3+ (N=28, median 11 days for I\u22642 and N=20, median 10 days for H3+, p=0.08) and platelet engraftment (median 11 days for I\u22642 and 12 days for H3+, p=0.54). Even dough, patients in the I\u22642 cohort received significantly less CD34+ cells/kg (median 4.46, range 2.10-4.99) compared to those in the H3+ group (median 6.33, range 5.10-8.99, p<0.001) and were similar in terms of age and number of lines of prior therapy. Conclusions Provided more than 2 \u00d710 6 CD34+ cells/kg are obtained in two days of leukapheresis, optimal engraftment times can be achieved even if the threshold of 5 \u00d710 6 CD34+ cells/kg is not reached. Our results suggest that the addition of harvest days beyond 2 days to obtain \u22655 \u00d710 6 CD34+ cells/kg may not contribute to improved short-term engraftment kinetics.
