    "abstract_text": "[Background] Myelodysplastic syndrome is an intractable disorder characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis. Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative therapy for eligible patients, hematopoiesis-supportive pharmacotherapy is practically important for transplant-ineligible patients to overcome transfusion dependency and infections. Vitamin K2 (VK2, menatetrenone) is a drug used to aim at improvement of hematopoiesis in MDS patients (Leukemia 14: 1156, 2000). However, the exact mechanism how VK2 improves hematopoiesis remains largely unknown. It was reported that VK2 induces MDS cells to undergo apoptosis (Leukemia 13: 1399, 1999). Here, we investigated our hypothesis that VK2 exerts its hematopoiesis-supportive effects through acting on mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BM-MSCs) in the bone marrow microenvironment. [Methods] Normal bone marrow (BM) samples from healthy adult volunteers were purchased from AllCells (Emeryville, CA). BM-CD34 + cells were isolated from BM-mononuclear cells using anti-CD34 immunomagnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Human BM-MSCs were isolated according to our previously published methods (Stem Cells 32:2245, 2014). In co-culture experiments, BM-MSCs with or without VK2 treatment were seeded on a 24-well culture plate. BM-CD34 + cells were applied on the MSC-grown plate and co-cultured in SFEM (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) supplemented with 100 ng/mL SCF, 100 ng/mL Flt-3 ligand, 50 ng/mL TPO and 20 ng/mL IL-3. After 10 days of co-culture, the number and surface marker expression of the expanded hematopoietic cells were examined by flow cytometric analysis. [Results] We first tested the direct effect of VK2 on BM-CD34 + cells. BM-CD34 + cells were treated with VK2 at various concentrations ranged from 0 \u00b5M to 10 \u00b5M for 24 hours and then cultured in SFEM in combinations with cytokines. Surprisingly, viable hematopoietic cells were hardly detected in the expansion culture of BM-CD34 + cells treated with 10 \u00b5M VK2. Even with 1 \u00b5M treatment, the number of CD45 + cells was decreased, as compared to that of expansion culture of untreated BM-CD34 + cells. The apoptosis analysis showed that the percentage of AnnexinV + PI + cells in the expanded hematopoietic cells is increased by VK2 treatment. We next examined the effect of VK2 on the hematopoiesis-supportive capability of BM-MSCs. BM-MSCs were pretreated with VK2 at various concentrations and then co-cultured with BM-CD34 + cells. The numbers of CD34 + cells and CD45 + cells were increased in a VK2 dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrated that VK2 shows different effects on distinct stem/progenitor cells: the induction of apoptosis in BM-CD34 + cells and the enhancement of hematopoiesis-supportive capability of BM-MSCs. We then investigated whether apoptosis-related cell death of BM-CD34 + cells by VK2 treatment is ameliorated in the presence of BM-MSCs. Both BM-CD34 + cells and BM-MSCs were treated with VK2 for 24 hours, and then co-cultured. The number of CD34 + cells was not decreased significantly in contrast to its severe decrease in single culture of VK2-treated BM-CD34 + cells. We further analyzed the effect of VK2 on BM-MSCs. Subpopulation analysis in co-culture of CD34 + cells with VK2-treated BM-MSCs showed that the expansion efficacy of CD34 + CD38 + cells is higher in comparison to that of CD34 + CD38 - cells. In addition, the percentages of CD34 - CD33 + cells and CD34 - CD13 + cells were higher than those in co-cultures with untreated BM-MSCs. Therefore, VK2-treated BM-MSCs supported the expanded CD34 + cells to skew their phenotype toward myeloid lineage. The presence of a transwell in the co-culture system was unrelated to the expansion pattern of CD34 + cells, which suggested the involvement of soluble factors with respect to the underlining mechanism. We therefore compared the levels of hematopoiesis-supporting cytokine mRNA expression in VK2-treated and untreated BM-MSCs: VK2-treated BM-MSCs showed lower expression of CXCL12/SDF-1 mRNA and a trend toward higher expression of GM-CSF mRNA. [Summary] VK2 acted on BM-MSCs to support their ability to enhance expansion and myeloid differentiation of BM-CD34 + cells probably via altered GM-CSF and CXCL12/SDF-1 expression in MSCs. These findings may help to identify the mechanisms of therapeutic effects of VK2 in patients with MDS (Figure).
