    "abstract_text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by hemolytic anemia in association with acute and chronic life-threatening clinical complications. Acute vaso-occlusive crisis (VOCs) are the main cause of hospitalization for SCD patients. In VOCs, amplified inflammatory response plays a key role in acute organ damage. Pro-Resolving lipid mediators such as resolvins (Rv) accelerate resolution of acute inflammation in different models, indicating that stimulation of endogenous resolution of inflammatory processes may be an additional strategy in limiting tissue damage. Recent data suggest beneficial effects of Rvs in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) related tissue injury. Here, we study the effects of Rvs on a model of acute VOCs using humanized SCD mice ( Hba tm1(HBA)Tow Hbb tm2(HBG1,HBB*)Tow ). We treated SCD and control healthy mice (AA, Hba tm1(HBA)Tow Hbb tm3(HBG1,HBB)Tow ) ( n =6-7 animals in each group) with RvD1 , 7S, 8R, 17S- trihydroxy-docosa-4Z, 9E, 11E, 13Z, 15E, 19Z-hexaenoic acid, 17 R- RvD1 , 7S, 8R, 17R- trihydroxy-docosa-4Z, 9E, 11E, 13Z, 15E, 19Z-hexaenoic acid; RvD2, 7S, 16R, 17S-trihydroxy-docosa-4Z, 8E, 10Z, 12E, 14E, 19Z-hexaenoic acid. Mice were treated with RvD1 and RvD2 at the dose of 2.5 ug/Kg by gavage 1 hour (hr) before H/R stress (10 hrs 8% oxygen followed by 3 hrs reoxygenation), which we have used in the past to mimic acute VOCs. We found that RvD1 and RvD2 significantly reduced the H/R-induced (i) increase in neutrophil count; (ii) lung inflammatory cell infiltrate, mucus and thrombi formation; (iii) glomerular inflammatory cell infiltration, glomerular sclerosis and thrombi formation. In the lung of H/R SCD mice, RvD1 prevented the H/R induced up-regulation of (i) cytokines such as MCP2, IL-6 and ET-1; (ii) vascular endothelial activation markers (VCAM-1 and ICAM-1; (iii) cytoprotective systems such as Prx6 and HO-1. In the kidney of H/R SCD mice, RvD1 significantly reduced H/R induced expression of IL-6 and ET-1 as well as HO-1. Our data indicate that RvD1 and RvD2 modulating inflammatory responses related to H/R in SCD, protect sickle cell target organs, and foster resolution. Thus, RvD1 and RvD2 might represent a novel therapeutic approach for acute VOCs in SCD. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
