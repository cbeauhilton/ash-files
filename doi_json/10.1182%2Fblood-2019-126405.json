    "abstract_text": "Background In 2016, results from the first URD SCT for SCD (the SCURT Trial) revealed a 2-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) of 79% (95% CI 59-90) and 69% (95% CI, 48-82) respectively following reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). 1 Though the RIC approach provided successful engraftment in the majority, the transplant approach was not considered safe for widespread adoption due to high rates of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) especially in children >13 years, a predominant cause of mortality. Strategies to minimize GVHD were essential if URD SCT was to be considered with curative intent in SCD. Aim/Method Multicenter trial (NCT03128996) with the primary objective of determining EFS in non-malignant disorders at one-year was amended as follows. The phase I SCD cohort included conditioning with hydroxyurea, proximal alemtuzumab, fludarabine, and melphalan in patients with 8/8 HLA-matched URD (-A, -B, - C and -DRB1). 1 Thiotepa (8 mg/kg) was added in 7/8 HLA-mismatched SCT. GVHD prophylaxis included a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate as previously described. Abatacept (10 mg/kg) was administered on days -1, +5, +14, +28, +60, +100, +180, +270 and +365 based on efficacy described against acute GVHD with early dosing after SCT for malignant disorders. 2,3 The latter 3 doses were omitted in cord transplant recipients. Result Thirteen children (7-21 years) underwent SCT (8/8 URD marrow- 7; 7/8 URD marrow or cord-6) primarily for stroke (N=6), \u22653 severe vaso-occlusive pain crises (N=4) or \u22652 acute chest syndrome episodes per year (N=3). The conditioning regimen was well tolerated. One patient had primary graft rejection after CMV infection (7%) and had autologous recovery. All other patients engrafted; neutrophils at median of 18 days (10-24), platelets at median of 28 days (16-39) and are surviving free of SCD with median follow-up of 12 months (range 4-59). Myeloid lineage donor chimerism was >95% and lymphoid was 39%- 100% at day+100. Two-year OS and EFS was 100% and 92.3% (95% CI, 6.57-35.7), respectively. The day+100 incidence of grade II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD incidence was 23% and 15% respectively. One-year incidence of chronic GVHD was 38%. However, only one patient (7%) developed extensive cGVHD. One patient (7%) developed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and recovered. Viral replication in blood was detected in 7 of 13 patients (7 CMV, 1 EBV reactivation). No patient developed EBV PTLD or required EBV-related intervention. Conclusion In comparison to previous experience 1 with RIC and URD SCT, our early observations are (1) a lower incidence of PRES (7 vs 34%) (2) low incidence of severe acute GVHD (15% vs 17% grade III -IV) despite mismatched donors, (3) low incidence of extensive chronic GVHD (7% vs 38%) and (4) no mortality despite patient age (10/13 were >13 years old). We attribute this gain to avoiding steroid use, and the benefit of including abatacept into the treatment regimen. The engraftment, safety, and immune reconstitution profile continue to be monitored in this ongoing trial now accruing in a Phase II cohort. As we and others work toward expanding donor options for SCD transplants, we submit that all alternate donor transplants for severe SCD are experimental and should be performed on clinical trials that track success and pitfalls.
