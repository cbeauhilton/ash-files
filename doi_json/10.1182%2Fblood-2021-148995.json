    "abstract_text": "TGF\u03b2 plays a pivotal role in the pathobiology of myelofibrosis (MF) by not only promoting bone marrow fibrosis (BMF) but also by enhancing the dormancy of normal but not MF hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). TGF\u03b2 has also previously been reported to inhibit normal megakaryocyte (MK) production (Bruno et al Blood 1998). TGF\u03b21 promotes the synthesis of collagen by normal human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Treatment of MSCs with AVID200, a potent TGF\u03b21/3 protein trap, significantly decreased MSC proliferation, phosphorylation of SMAD2, and collagen expression. Robust expression of pSMAD2 was observed in the absence of exogenous TGF\u03b2 in normal donor or MF-MKs, Addition of AVID200 to MKs decreased pSMAD2 without affecting total SMAD2/3 and led to increased numbers of MKs. Treatment of MF MNCs with AVID200 also led to increased numbers of progenitor cells with wild type JAK2 and a reduction of mutated colonies. A phase 1b trial of AVID200 (NCT03895112) was performed and completed in INT-2/high risk MF patients resistant/intolerant to ruxolitinib (rux); baseline platelet count of \u2265 25 x 10 9 /L, and grade 2/3 BMF. Subjects received AVID200 intravenously on Day 1 of a 21 day cycle. Response was assessed by IWG/ELN criteria after 6 cycles of AVID200. Subjects attaining at least a CI or SD with a decrease in BMF by \u22651 grade, continued AVID200. We previously presented the results of the dose escalation study (Mascarenhas ASH 2020) demonstrating that AVID200 was well tolerated without dose limiting toxicities at 3 tested dose levels (Lots A and B) in dose cohorts of 180 mg (A), 550 mg (A)/70 mg (B), and 180 mg (B). Here we report updated safety and efficacy results of the phase 1b dose expansion stage at the two highest doses tested (70 mg (B) and 180 mg (B). Twenty-two subjects were enrolled (1 withdrew before receiving treatment) and 9 were treated with AVID200 in the dose escalation phase and 12 in the dose expansion phase [Table1]. Median time after rux discontinuation was 7.4 months (0.5-59.9). The most common mutations observed at baseline in this cohort included JAK2V617F (71%), TET2 (29%) ASXL1 (24%) and CALR (19%). (Fig 1) No DLTs were observed and Grade 3/4 AEs were observed in 16 (76.2%) subjects. Grade 3/4 non-hematologic AEs were observed in 8 (38.1%) subjects and included one subject in each case (epistaxis, mucositis, extraocular muscle paresis, fatigue, rash, duodenal hemorrhage, gastric hemorrhage, urinary tract infection, and syncope). Grade 3/4 hematologic AEs were anemia (6; 28.3%) and thrombocytopenia (2; 14.3%) [Table 2]. No fatal events were observed. The median number of cycles received was 5 (range 2 - 13) and 7 (33%) patients received more than 6 cycles. For dose levels 2-3 at cycle 7, a CI was attained in one subject at dose level 2 [anemia, spleen and TSS], 5 subjects had SD, 3 subjects had PD and two subjects with 10% and 15% blasts at screening developed MPN-BP while on study based on central review. Reasons for discontinuation by local PI included PD (n=8), lack of response (n=5), study completed (n=2), other (n=2), patient decision (n=1). Median % change in palpable spleen length was +10% (range -70% to +150%) and TSS change was -50% (-100% to +185.7%) The median platelet count at baseline was 114 x 10 9 /L (range: 28-695) and 215 x 10 9 /L (range: 66-263) after cycle 6 in 7 evaluable subjects (Fig 2A). Notably, 17 subjects had an increase in platelets from baseline during treatment and two subjects normalized their platelet counts. Maximum changes in platelets from baseline across all cycles was +63.8% [range -15.7%, +505.5%] (Fig 2B). Paired bone marrow biopsy pathology samples for 12 subjects were available for central review and showed no significant changes in BMF score or MK histo topography at end of treatment compared to baseline. All patients had elevated plasma levels of TGF \u03b21, but not TGF\u03b22/\u03b23 levels as detected by ELISA, which were dramatically reduced 21 days after the last dose of AVID200. AVID200 a TGF\u03b21/3 protein trap is well tolerated and clinical responses at cycle 7 of therapy in this advanced MF patient population were limited as judged by IWG/MRT response criteria. However, AVID200 therapy resulted in significant reduction in serum TGF\u03b2 levels and improvements in platelet counts indicating that TGF \u03b21 plays a pivotal role in MF leading to thrombocytopenia which can be reversed with AVID200 therapy. We conclude that AVID200 may best be employed in combination therapy approaches in thrombocytopenic MF patients.
