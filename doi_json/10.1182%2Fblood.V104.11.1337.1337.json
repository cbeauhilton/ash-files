    "abstract_text": "Background : In a double-blind randomized trial of empirical antifungal Rx for persistently febrile neutropenic pts, CAS was as effective as and better tolerated than L-AmB. We now examine the results of this study in the subgroup of pts with AML. Methods : Randomization to CAS (70 mg x 1, then 50 mg/d) or L-AmB (3 mg/kg/d) was stratified by risk category [high risk = allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant or relapsed acute leukemia] and use of antifungal prophylaxis. The primary efficacy endpoint was % of treated pts with documented fever and neutropenia who had a successful outcome defined by all the following: successful Rx of baseline (BL) invasive fungal infection (IFI) (if any), no breakthrough (BT) IFI to 7 d post-Rx, survival @7d post-Rx, no premature discontinuation (DC) due to lack of efficacy or study drug toxicity, and fever resolution x 48 hr during neutropenia. Results : 703/1095 (64%) of the treated pts had AML, including 364/556 (65%) and 339/539 (63%) in the CAS and L-AmB groups, respectively. Demographic characteristics were similar in AML pts in both Rx groups. 27% of CAS and 22% of L-AmB pts with AML were high risk. Median days of Rx were: CAS, 12; L-AmB, 11.

Conclusions : In this post hoc subgroup analysis, CAS provided an effective and generally well-tolerated option for the empirical Rx of persistently febrile neutropenic pts with AML.",
