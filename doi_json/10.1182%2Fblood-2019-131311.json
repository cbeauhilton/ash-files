    "abstract_text": "Activation Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AICDA/AID) is a DNA-directed cytidine deaminase that is normally only expressed in activated B-cells to promote somatic hypermutations and immunoglobulin class switching. In cancer cells, AID causes significant genotoxic stress through DNA replication fork damage, creating a dependency upon the homologous recombination repair factor, RAD51, for survival. We have demonstrated anti-cancer activity through disruption of this axis in multiple preclinical lymphoid cancer models. Autoreactive B cells depend on RAD51 for survival and are chronically auto-stimulated and therefore continually re-express AID. It has been shown that ectopic expression of AID in autoreactive B-cells causes genome-wide DNA damage (similar to cancers). Given the role of autoreactive B cells and autoantibodies in autoimmune disorders, we hypothesize that immunomodulation of B cells via the RAD51/AID axis will remediate inflammatory disease processes. Our previous data suggests that RAD51 modulation enhances the CD73+ B cell population and reduces antibody diversity in T1D mice, indicating precise effects on AID-mediated antibody diversification. CYT-0853 is a novel RAD51 inhibitor that sensitizes cells to AID activity. Here, we assessed the in vivo effect of CYT-0853 on primary B cells and antibody production. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were treated with 40mg/kg CYT-0853 or vehicle for five weeks. One-week post-treatment start, mice were immunized with DNP-KLH antigen mixed with Complete Freund's Adjuvant. A second booster with DNP-KLH antigen mixed with Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant was administered two weeks later. At termination, blood, spleen, and bone marrow was collected for analysis by flow cytometry. Surface expression of CD45, CD19, IgM, and IgG1 was assessed to determine white blood cell count, B cells, and pre- and post-class switch recombination (CSR), respectively. While no significant changes to B cell populations were observed in bone marrow or spleen, we demonstrate that CYT-0853 significantly decreases the median number of circulating CD45+ and IgG1 (post-CSR) B cells (61.8% vs. 31.6% and 8.7% vs. 4.4%, respectively). In addition, we observed a modest, significant increase in the amount of IgM+ (pre-CSR) B cells. These results were complemented by an associated overall significant decrease in circulating IgM levels. Of note, no adverse effects were observed in these mice over this treatment period. Based on these data and the role of B cells not only in antibody production, but also as antigen-presenting cells in multiple sclerosis, we tested our molecule in the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 -experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of multiple sclerosis. Prophylactic treatment using 40mg/kg CYT-0853 did not affect disease activity or circulating cytokine production, however we observed a significant decrease in the spleen. Based on these results, further exploration is warranted to harness the power of CYT-0853 on the AID/RAD51 axis. This specific targeting may elicit beneficial therapeutic changes to B-lymphocyte populations and provide a novel immunomodulatory target to treat immunity and inflammation. Taken together, these data provide a foundation for continued preclinical development of CYT-0853 with applicability towards autoimmune diseases.
