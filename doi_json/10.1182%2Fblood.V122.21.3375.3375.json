    "abstract_text": "Background Predictors of outcomes after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) stem cell transplantation (SCT) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are not well established. The Dana Farber (DF) investigators (Brown et al, leukemia 2013) developed a prognostic scoring model for overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) that assigned one point to each of comorbidity index, absolute lymphocyte count, LDH and disease status. The goals of the present study were to 1) validate the DF model 2) identify additional predictors of outcomes after SCT. Methods This study is a retrospective review of the Mayo Clinic CLL database and was approved by the Institutional Review Board. All CLL patients that underwent RIC-SCT were included. The prognostic significance of prognostic factors at time of RIC-SCT were analyzed, including the DF model. Survival was estimated and compared using the Kaplan Meier and Log Rank tests. Results From 2006 to 2012, 50 patients with CLL underwent RIC-SCT at the Mayo Clinic. Of these, 33 were male (66%) and the median age was 56 (29-69) years. The median time from diagnosis to RIC-SCT was 4.7 years (0.6-22.9). Indications for RIC-SCT were 17p deletion in 24 (48%) patients and purine nucleoside analogue (PNA) refractory disease in 26 (52%) patients. Transplant related mortality was 6% and non-relapse mortality at 5 years was 14%. Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) developed in 30 (60%) patients and chronic (c) GVHD was noted in 32 patients (64%). The 5-year relapse rate was 38%. The DF prognostic score stratified three categories for OS (score of 0, 1-2, \u2265 3), but was not associated with DFS in this cohort. We next evaluated the impact of other patient, disease, and transplant characteristics on clinical outcome. Development of cGVHD post-transplant was the dominant predictor of both DFS (HR 0.26, 95% CI=0.10-0.69, P=0.006) and OS (HR 0.04, 95% CI=0.01-0.19, P<0.0001, figure 1 ). The presence of 17p deletion at time of RIC-SCT was associated with shorter DFS (HR 3.99, 95% CI=1.43-11.18, P=0.008), but did not impact OS. Developing cGVH but not DF score remained an independent predictor of OS on a multi-variate analysis including both factors.

Patients with higher scores on DF prognostic model were less likely to develop cGVHD (score 0=66%, 1-2=76%, \u22653=31%; P=0.01). Three CLL characteristics (complete or partial remission at time of RIC-SCT, absence of 17p deletion, and absence of ZAP70 overexpression) were predictors for development of cGVHD while alemtuzumab exposure \u22643 months prior to RIC-SCT decreased likelihood of cGVHD. On multivariate modeling using these four predictors, only ZAP70 overexpression was an independent negative predictor of developing cGVHD ( Table 1 ). Rates of cGVHD post RIC-SCT in ZAP 70 positive and ZAP70 negative patients were 50% and 92%, respectively (p=0.03). Table 1 Predictors for development of cGVHD after RIC-SCT for CLL  Variable .

Pretransplant characteristics that predict subsequent cGVHD include DF prognostic score and ZAP70 status. This is the first report to identify biologic characteristics of CLL B-cells associated with development of cGVHD post-transplant. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
