    "abstract_text": "In the setting of AML, RIC regimens have emerged as an attractive modality to decrease toxicity. However, toxicity might represent only one aspect of the problem, since AML encompasses a group of chemosensitive diseases, raising concerns that significant reduction of the intensity of the preparative regimen, while increasing immunosuppression, may have a negative impact on long-term outcome. This report describes the comparative results of 31 AML patients in CR1 receiving RIC allo-SCT from an HLA-identical sibling in 2 institutions (Nantes, n=13; and Marseille, n=18) using 2 different \u201cglobal\u201d treatment approaches (Table below). After achievement of CR1, the \u201cNantes\u201d approach included administration of one or two courses of consolidation with high-dose cytarabine (HDC), followed immediately by allo-SCT conditioned with a genuine nonmyeloablative, but highly immunosuppressive RIC regimen including fludarabine, low dose busulfan (4 mg/Kg), ATG (5 mg/Kg) and both CsA and corticosteroids for GVHD prophylaxis (\u201cFB1A2\u201d group). The \u201cMarseille\u201d program aimed to deliver after CR1, in addition to HDC, an autologous SCT followed by allo-SCT conditioned with fludarabine, an intermediate dose of busulfan (8 mg/Kg), low dose ATG (2.5 mg/Kg) and CsA alone for GVHD prophylaxis (\u201cFB2A1\u201d group). In the \u201cFB2A1\u201d group, 12 patients (67%) could actually receive the planned auto-SCT. With a median follow-up of 47 months, leukemia-free survival (LFS) in the whole study population was 56% at 5 years. However, the KM estimate of LFS was significantly higher in the \u201cFB2A1\u201d group as compared to the \u201cFB1A2\u201d group ( P =0.01; 72% vs. 31% at 5 years). Overall, 8 patients (26%; 95%CI, 11\u201341%) had relapsed at a median of 320 (range, 241\u2013707) days after diagnosis, and the significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of LFS was likely due to a higher risk of leukemia relapse in the \u201cFB1A2\u201d group (6/13, vs. 2/18; P=0.07). Five patients died from toxicity, for an overall incidence of TRM of 16% (95%CI, 6\u201334%), with this being comparable between the 2 groups (2/13 vs. 3/18; P=NS). Such comparable TRM despite a more \u201cintensive\u201d approach, translated towards a higher overall survival in the \u201cFB2A1\u201d group as compared to the \u201cFB1A2\u201d group (72% vs. 42% at 5 years; P=0.07). After controlling for relevant factors, in the multivariate analysis, actual performance of auto-SCT prior to RIC allo-SCT ( P =0.04; RR=4.9; 95%CI, 1.1\u201322.4), was significantly predictive of an improved LFS. We conclude that RIC allo-SCT from an HLA-matched related donor represents a valid option for AML patients not eligible for standard allo-SCT. However, in order to achieve optimal results, a comprehensive treatment \u201cpackage\u201d including some form of high dose therapy prior to RIC allo-SCT and/or semi-intensive cytoreduction/myeloablation incorporated within the RIC regimen is likely necessary to allow sufficient time for the GVL effect.
