    "abstract_text": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of multiple myeloma (MM)-derived exosomes on the number and function of CD4 + T, CD8 + T and regulatory T cells in healthy donors (HD) and MM patients. METHODS: MM cell-derived (OPM2, U266) exosomes were extracted by ultracentrifugation and kit method and co-cultured with CD4 + T, CD8 + T and CD4 + CD25 + CD127dimT cells (Treg) from HD and MM patients sorted by magnetic beads. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis rate of T cells, level of perforin and granzyme B in CD8 + T. Cell viability was detected by CCK8 kit, and IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 levels were detected by ELISA. RESULTS: HD-CD4+T apoptotic rate was higher in the OPM2 group (6.24\u00b11.24%) and U266 group (5.42\u00b11.07%) than in the control group (4.37\u00b10.96%). The HD-CD4+T viability in U266 group (85.45\u00b16.09%) decreased compared with the control group. The apoptotic rate of HD-CD8+T was decreased in the OPM2 group (9.97\u00b11.28%) and the U266 group (11.00\u00b11.75%) compared with the control group (16.12\u00b12.95%). HD-CD8+T cell viability was increased in the OPM2 group (112.63\u00b13.88%) and the U266 group (111.70\u00b13.62%) compared with the control group. Perforin of HD-CD8+T in U266 group (9.34\u00b12.36%) was lower than the control group (12.76\u00b13.31%); Perforin of MM-CD8+T in OPM2 group (6.48\u00b11.06%) and U266 group (5.63\u00b11.15%) decreased compared with the control group (10.55 \u00b1 2.50%). The apoptosis rate of HD-Treg was lower in OPM2 group (15.33\u00b13.87%) and U266 group (11.71\u00b12.71%) than in control group (19.61\u00b13.50%). The apoptosis rate of MM-Treg was higher in U266 group (37.29\u00b16.54%) than the control group (29.95 \u00b1 6.68%). The viability of HD-Treg in U266 group (173.48\u00b134.99%) was higher than the control group. The viability of MM-Treg in OPM2 group (82.29\u00b112.16%) was lower than the control group. The supernatant IL-10 from HD-Treg in OPM2 group (18.53\u00b18.08 pg/ml) was higher than the control group (8.49\u00b14.02 pg/ml). The supernatant TGF-\u03b2from MM-Treg was decreased in the OPM2 group (290.29\u00b123.21pg/ml) and the U266 group (230.03\u00b115.96pg/ml) compared with the control group (387.49\u00b121.60pg/ml) (P<0.05). Conclusion: MM-derived exosomes can promote apoptosis and inhibit proliferation of HD-CD4 + T, inhibit apoptosis and promote proliferation but inhibit perforin secretion of HD-CD8 + T, inhibit apoptosis and promote proliferation HD-Treg, and promotes IL-10 secretion.
