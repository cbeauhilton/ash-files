    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4669 The aim was to analyze the risk factors for overall surrival at 5 years in 96 patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation by retrospec- tive analysis. 11 clinical parameters were selected for univariate analysis by using a Cox regression: age, sex, morbid rate, HLA locus, donor type, donor-recipient blood type, conditioning regimen, aGVHD, HC, VOD and IP. Factors significant at the 0.1 level on univariate analysis were evaluated by multivariate analysis by a Cox regres- sion. The cumulative incidence of aGVHD and patients survival rate were calculated by the method of Kaplan and Meier. 95 patients achieved sustained donor engraftment except one patients not. The median time of leukocyte engraftment was 13 days. The incidence rates of grades I\u223cIV acute GVHD was 43.75%.one of grades I aGVHD was 11.46%,gradesIIaGVHD was 19.79%,grades III\u223c\u2021WaGVHD was 12.50%. Ten patients relapsed and 38 dead,the overall survival at 5 years was 60.42%. The COX method analysis showed that aGVHD and disease states at transplant significantly im- proved OS. In conclusions, The key to improve the outcome of allo- HSCT is to red- uce the incidence and severity of aGVHD, meanwhile selecting the suitable disease state of CR 1 at transplantation to treat the patients in advanced refractory and recure- nt situation.
