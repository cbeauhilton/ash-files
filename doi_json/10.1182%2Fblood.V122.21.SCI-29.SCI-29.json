    "abstract_text": "The discovery of extensive transcription of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) provide an important new perspective on the centrality of RNA in gene regulation. Discussions will cover genome-scale strategies to discover and characterize lncRNAs. An emerging theme from multiple model systems is that lncRNAs form extensive networks of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes with numerous chromatin regulators, and both control and target these enzymatic activities to appropriate locations in the genome. Consistent with this notion, long non-coding RNAs can function as modular scaffolds to specify higher order organization in RNP complexes and in chromatin states. More recently, lncRNAs have been found to control post-transcriptional processes and signal transduction as well. The importance of these modes of regulation is underscored by the newly recognized roles of long RNAs in developmental patterning and cancer.
