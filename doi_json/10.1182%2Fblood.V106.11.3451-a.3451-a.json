    "abstract_text": "The anemia of chronic disease-which encompasses inflammation, infection, tissue injury, and conditions associated with the release of proinflammatory cytokines (such as cancer)- is one of the most common forms of anemia seen clinically. Symptomatic anemia requires treatment. The two major forms of treatment are transfusions and erythropoietin. Arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3 ) used to treat human diseases for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine. Our recent studies suggest that low dose of As 2 O 3 induces erythroid differentiation of K562 human leukemic cells and high dose of As 2 O 3 induce apoptosis. In this study, we have investigated in vitro effect of As 2 O 3 on the erythroid differentiation and it could inhibit TNF- \u03b1 induced suppression of erythroid differentiation of human cord blood CD34+ cells. Expression of glycophorin A was 35.94 \u00b1 7.94% after 7 days culture of human cord blood CD34+ cells and was decreased to 17.63 \u00b1 7.33% when culture of human cord blood CD34+ cells with 100ng/mL of TNF- \u03b1 . Expression of glycophorin A was increased in dose dependent manner after 7 days treatment with As 2 O 3 and As 2 O 3 increased percentage of glycophorin A in culture with TNF- \u03b1 compared to TNF- \u03b1 alone. The results of colony assay of CFU-MIX and BFU-E after culture with various conditions revealed similar patterns with expression of glycophorin A. These results suggest that As 2 O 3 induces erythroid differentiation of human cord blood CD34+ cells and can reverse TNF- \u03b1 induced suppression of erythroid differentiation of human cord blood CD34+ cells.
