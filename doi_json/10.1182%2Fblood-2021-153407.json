    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Our previous qualitative studies of immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) survivors revealed that patients did not communicate to their hematologists about residual cognitive and fatigue issues. A way to overcome this communication barrier is implementation of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in routine care. Integration of PROs into the clinical care of other diseases has resulted in improved patient-provider communication, symptom management, quality of life and overall patient satisfaction. However, decisions about the mode of administration are challenging. Although 92% of the United States population has access to the internet, studies have shown minorities prefer alternative modes of administration. Given that iTTP disproportionately affects Black women, understanding patient preference is critical for integrating PRO instruments into routine care. The primary study goal was to determine the preferred mode of administration of PRO instruments in iTTP. Furthermore, many individuals use the internet as a source of medical information/advice. A study of iTTP literacy reported that only 34% of survivors correctly identified disease relapse risk factors suggesting a critical knowledge gap. A secondary goal was to describe iTTP survivors' behaviors regarding using the internet for medical information or support. Methods: We utilized a cross-sectional study design. iTTP survivors were recruited from August 2019 until present. Eligibility included: 1) age >18 years, 2) documented ADAMTS13 deficiency (< 10% activity) at diagnosis or during a relapse and 3) > 1-year clinical remission. Multi-center recruitment of survivors included: Oklahoma University, Ohio State University, University of Minnesota, Johns Hopkins University, University of Rochester, University of Pennsylvania, University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Utah and the University of Vermont. Following informed consent, survivors were administered the PROMIS \u00ae cognitive function ability, anxiety and fatigue instruments via their preferred mode (online, telephone, or self-administered). Typical internet usage, behaviors regarding searching for health information online and demographics were also obtained. Results : To date, 94 survivors have completed the study (83% female; 54% White; 34% Black; median age 49 years [range 26-85 years]). A majority (54%) preferred completing PROMIS \u00ae surveys online vs. self-administered or telephone administered. However, among Black survivors, only 38% preferred online administration and among survivors aged \u226565 years only 22% preferred online administration. Interestingly, there was an overall shift in a preference toward online administration following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (45% (21/47) preferred online pre vs 66% (31/47) preferred online post). Ninety-one percent (86/94) of survivors reported at least occasional internet use vs 8 (9%) reported none. Similarly, 82% (70/85) had searched the internet for health/medical information for themselves in the past year. Also 62% (53/86) of the survivors selected 'strongly agree' or 'agree' to the statement that the internet helps them determine if symptoms are important enough to see a doctor. Likewise, 62% used the internet to interpret doctor's recommendations. Additionally, 47% (40/86) 'strongly agree/agree' the internet helped determine if they would take a medication/seek alternative treatment. Moreover, 64% (55/86) agreed the internet was a good way to find others experiencing similar health problems. However, when asked about behaviors over the past year, only 42% (36/85) used online social networking sites like Facebook to look for health information or find others with iTTP and only 36% (31/85) had actually participated in online iTTP support groups. Conclusions : Overall iTTP survivors preferred online PRO administration; however, Black and older survivors preferred other methods. Recognizing these preferences is a vital step toward integrating PROs into routine care. Furthermore, iTTP survivors are using the internet as a source of medical support and information. Therefore, it is critical to not only educate iTTP survivors about credible online resources but also to create additional content. Also, future studies are needed to further explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on online health behaviors. Disclosures Terrell:  Sanofi: Consultancy; Takeda: Consultancy.
