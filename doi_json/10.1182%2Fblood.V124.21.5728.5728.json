    "abstract_text": "Ankaferd Blood Stopper (ABS), a unique traditional herbal mixture, has been used topically to stop bleeding for centuries in Anatolia. As well as ABS has been used as a blood-stopping agent, it may also have a considerable therapeutic benefit, because of its anti-infective, anti-neoplastic, and wound healing properties. The aim of this study is to investigate the anti-neoplastic effects of the ABS on myeloma cell line, in vitro and on the plasmocytoma development in Balb/c mice by intraperitoneal injection of pristane, in vivo . We therefore sought to evaluate the efficacy of ABS on MM cells and to study the modulation of cell-death pathways. The cytotoxicity of ABS against the MM cell lines (RPMI-8226, and ARH-77) was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide-dye reduction assay. Responses to ABS by RPMI-8226 and ARH-77 cell lines were dose dependent but not time dependent. The IC 50 values for RPMI 8226 and ARH 77 myeloma cell lines in 24h were 12,84 \u03bcL/mL and 13,86 \u03bcL/mL, respectively. Various cell-death characteristics such as caspase-3, Bcl-2, Bax were studied in response to ABS, but we couldn\u2019t demonstrate specific features of apoptotic cell death, in vitro . We have also investigated the effect of the ABS on the pristane (2.6.10.14-tetramethylpentadecane)-induced plasmacytoma (PCT) development on six-week-old BALB/c mice. Three groups of mice were treated with intraperitoneal ABS (1 mg/kg, 0.5mg/kg, and 0,1mg/kg) per-week for eight weeks after pristane-induced PCT development. The study was stopped at twelfth week, the remaining mice were autopsied, and peritoneal tissues were examined histologically for PCTs. A database of different groups\u2019 mice was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression statistics based on variables. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a difference of the survival of pristane-induced alone between the groups of pristane-induced plus ABS 1 mg/kg, 0.5mg/kg, and 0.1mg/kg. (Log-rank, p=0.016; p<0.001 and p<0.001; respectively). The present results indicate that direct anti-tumor effect of ABS on pristane-induced PCT and significantly increased survival. This hypothesis needs to now be further investigated in clinical trials. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
