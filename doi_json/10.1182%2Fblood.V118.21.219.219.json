    "abstract_text": "Abstract 219 Osteocytes, the most abundant and long living cells of bone embedded in the bone matrix, coordinate bone remodeling by regulating osteoblast and osteoclast activity, at least in part, via G-protein coupled receptor signaling. Osteoblasts and osteoclasts control hematopoiesis primarily by influencing self-renewal, differentiation, and mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells in their endosteal bone niche. A role for osteocytes in hematopoiesis has previously not been demonstrated. We engineered mice lacking Gs\u03b1 in osteocytes (DMP1-Gs\u03b1KO) using the Cre-loxP recombination technique. Consistent with the previously established role of osteocytes in regulation of bone remodeling, DMP1-Gs\u03b1KO mice showed severe osteopenia and a decrease in cortical thickness. The osteopenia in the KO mice was due to a dramatic decrease in osteoblast numbers whereas the number and activity of osteoclasts was unaffected. In addition, DMP1-Gs\u03b1KO mice displayed hematopoietic abnormalities that resembled a myeloproliferative syndrome (MPS) characterized by leukocytosis and neutrophilia. Myeloid cells were increased in the peripheral blood, bone marrow (BM), and spleen in DMP1-Gs\u03b1KO mice compared to controls (p<0.01 in blood, BM and spleen, N\u22656) as assessed by CBC and immunophenotypical flow cytometry analysis. Lineage- negative c-kit-positive and Sca-1+ (LKS) cells and LKS CD150-positive CD48-negative (LKS SLAM) cells were significantly increased in DMP1-Gs\u03b1KO spleen compared to controls whereas there was no change in the bone marrow suggesting mobilization from the bone marrow in mutant mice. Surprisingly, the number of colonies formed in in-vitro methylcellulose assays from BM cells from DMP1-Gs\u03b1KO mice were not changed indicating the requirement of the bone microenvironment to induce MPS. Co-culture of osteocyte-enriched bone explants from DMP1-Gs\u03b1KO mice with control BM cells significantly increased the number of colonies compared to control explants. Transplantation of BM from control to DMP1-Gs\u03b1KO mice rapidly recapitulated the MPS whereas converse transplantation completely normalized the hematopoietic abnormality. Protein expression of CXCL2 (macrophage inflammatory protein 2 alpha; MIP2-alpha), a chemotactic cytokine known to mobilize hematopoietic stem and myeloid cells, was markedly increased in Gsa deficient osteocytes as assessed by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, CXCL2 secretion in conditioned media from osteocyte explants cultures was also increased 3-fold in Gsa deficient osteocytes as compared to controls. In summary, our results represent the first evidence for osteocyte-mediated regulation of hematopoiesis via Gs\u03b1-signaling-induced alteration of the BM microenvironment, possibly through CXCL2 signaling.
