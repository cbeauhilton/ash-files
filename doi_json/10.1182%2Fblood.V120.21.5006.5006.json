    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5006 Multiple myeloma (MM) is a fatal neoplasm characterized by the accumulation of malignant plasma cells within the bone marrow (BM) and the presence of a monoclonal immunoglobulin in the serum and/or urine, it was reported that patients with abnormal metaphases by conventional cytogenetics at diagnosis had active disease and a reduced survival rate compared with those normal metaphase. To further explore the cytogenetic characteristics of multiple myeloma and its correlation with clinical treatment and prognosis, 38 cases of MM were collected and chromosome specimens of bone marrow cells were prepared by 24-hour culture. R-banding technique combined with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization(i-FISH) was used for karyotype analysis. The impact of different treatments and chromosome aberrations on progression-free survival(PFS) and overall survival(OS) time as well as related prognosis factors of MM were analyzed. The detected total chromosome aberration rate was 34. 2% (13/38), with chromosome complex aberration 53. 8%(7/13). The detection rate of R-banding technique was 23. 7%(9/38) and 21. 1%(8/38) by FISH. The most frequent chromosome aberration was chromosome 1 abnormality. The median PFS time of abnormal group was 16 months and was not reached of normal group after median follow up for 36 months(P=0. 045). Also, the median PFS time of complex abnormal group was 15 months, and the median PFS time of non-complex abnormal group was not reached(P=0. 012). The median OS time of complex abnormal group was 22 months and the median OS time of non-complex abnormal group was not reached(P=0. 041). Boretizomib or autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation prolonged the PFS and OS of the chromosome aberration group compared with traditional chemotherapy, but there were no significant statistical differences between the two groups(P>0. 05). It was concluded that chromosome complex aberration is the mainly cytogenetic characteristics of multiple myeloma, and multiple numerous and structural aberrations are involved. The patients with chromosome complex aberration have poor prognosis. Chromosome abnormalities detected in metaphases from multiple myeloma (MM) cells have a clear impact on prognosis and response to therapy. Techniques to explore cytogenetic and molecular genetic changes of myeloma cells should be used to improve chromosomal aberration detection to guide clinical treatments and evaluate prognosis.
