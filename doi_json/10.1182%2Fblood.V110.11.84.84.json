    "abstract_text": "High-dose prophylaxis for severe hemophilia A [25\u201340 factor (F) VIII Units (u) kg \u22121 on alternate days] reduces arthropathy, but does so at great cost. ( NEJM  2007 ; 357 : 535 \u2013544 ). Less intensive prophylaxis regimens might be cost-effective while reducing the need for indwelling venous access devices and their attendant complications. Tailored prophylaxis starts with FVIII, 50 u kg \u22121 weekly (Step1). If bleeding frequency is unacceptable (4 joint/soft tissue bleeds or 5 bleeds into a joint on a step of protocol), or if a target joint develops (\u22653 bleeds into a single index joint-ankle, elbow or knee) over a consecutive 3-month period the dose of FVIII is escalated to 30 u kg \u22121 twice weekly (Step 2); a third escalation to 25 u kg \u22121 on alternate days if bleeding frequency remains unacceptable (Step3). Objectives: To assess the degree of joint damage in the 6 index joints for subjects receiving tailored prophylaxis. Methods: We studied an inception cohort of boys ages 1\u20132.5 years with severe hemophilia A (<2% FVIII) and no inhibitors treated with tailored prophylaxis. Patients were followed at 6 monthly intervals and parents have kept detailed diaries. Joint damage was measured using a validated physiotherapy joint score and function was assessed using the Child Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) Results: 54 boys were enrolled from 11 Canadian hemophilia treatment centers. The total follow-up is 3423 patient months (mean 62.2 months, median 54 months and range 5\u2013117 months). 16 (29.6%) boys have been escalated to Step 2 and 14 (25.9%) have escalated to Step 3. 11 of the escalations were due to target joint bleeding. Subjects on study had a mean of 1.4 joint bleeds/patient-year.

Non compliant subjects had the poorest outcomes. No treatment related adverse events have occurred. Conclusion: Tailored primary prophylaxis should be considered as a valid option for long term prophylaxis in young boys with severe hemophilia A.  . Maximum Possible Score . Median . Observed Range .
