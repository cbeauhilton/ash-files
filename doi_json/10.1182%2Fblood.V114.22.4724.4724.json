    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4724 Aim Abnormalities and alterations in apoptosis mechanism may lead to cancer development. Cystean proteases enzymes, called caspases, appear to be involved in both the initial signaling events. There are many proteins that trigger intrinsic and extrinsic pathway and induce apoptosis signals. Fas and its specific ligand that known as Fas Ligand are the best defined dead receptors and have functions in apoptosis regulation with many tumor types. Fas binds the ligand on the cytotoxic T cells and start apoptosis. Objectives of this study were to determine serum levels of Fas and Fas Ligand at the time of diagnosis in childhood acute leukemias that may be play important role in apoptosis mechanism. Patients and Methods In this study, we investigated serum Fas and Fas Ligand levels by using ELISA method in childhood acute leukemias. Twenty-nine cases with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and twenty-three cases with acute myeloblastic leukemia at the ages of 1-18 years are included this study. The age distrubition of the control group varied 1-15 years consisted of twenty-seven children. We investigated serum Fas and Fas Ligand levels at the time of diagnosis from peripheral blood samples. Results The comparison of the mean values of Fas and Fas Ligand levels in acute leukemia patients groups and control group have shown important difference as statistically (p0,05). The comparison of the Fas levels in ALL patients according to immunophenotypes; CALLA(+) B-ALL have higher mean level than T-ALL and shown important difference as statistically (p<0,05). The comparison of the mean values of Fas level at the diagnosis in ALL patients who had relapsed and patients who had remission have shown important difference (p<0,05). The mean values of Fas level were found higher in relapsed ALL patients. In these results showed that Fas and Fas ligand may play important role in apoptosis mechanism.
