    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1590 Background: The occurrence of a secondary lymphoma in patients with a prior history of B-cell lymphomas has been reported. 1 , 2  There are few reported occurrences of Multiple Myeloma (MM) in patients (pts) with a prior history of lymphoma and the biologic relationship between the two neoplasms in such cases is unknown. Methods: We queried our IRB approved clinicopathologic database of hematologic malignancies for patients with lymphoma and MM. Of the 4165 pts with B-cell lymphoma and 804 pts with MM, 6 pts with a history of B-cell lymphoma developed MM and 1 patient with a prior history of MM developed a B-cell lymphoma. We describe the morphology, immunophenotype, and clinical features of the 7 pts. The clonal relationship of the 2 components was analyzed using sequencing analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IgVH) genes and by light chain restriction. Results: There were 5 men and 2 women (median age of diagnosis of lymphoma, 65 years; median age of diagnosis of MM, 71 years). The pts with lymphoma included 2 pts with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, 2 pts with small lymphocytic lymphoma, 2 pts with follicular lymphoma and 1 patient with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. The development of MM was metachronous in 5 cases, following B-cell lymphoma by 3 years to 23 years and synchronous in 1 case. In 1 patient, the B-cell lymphoma developed 6 years after the diagnosis of MM. 6 pts achieved complete remission after treatment for lymphoma and 1 patient is ongoing treatment. 6 of the 7 pts required treatment for MM soon after diagnosis. 1 patient has smoldering MM and continues to be observed 57 months after diagnosis. FISH analysis indicated IgH rearrangement in 3 pts with MM; 1 patient with 17p deletion and monosomy 13; 3 pts had normal FISH and metaphase cytogenetics. In 3 pts, both neoplasms were kappa light chain restricted; in 1 patient both were lambda restricted; in 1 patient, the lymphoma was lambda light chain restricted while the MM was kappa light chain restricted and the reverse in another pt; in 1 patient the B-cell lymphoma was light chain negative and the MM was kappa restricted. IgVH rearrangement studies in 4 patients in whom tissue samples were available indicated that the two were clonally unrelated in 3 patients and related in only 1 patient. Conclusion: Clonality analysis of rearranged immunoglobulin genes from patients with both B-cell lymphoma and MM provide evidence of separate clonal origins of the two tumors in the majority of cases, thus excluding secondary transformation of the original B-cell clone. The presence or absence of a genetic predisposition to the development of multiple B cell malignancies requires further study. 3  Disclosures: Off Label Use: The combination of lenalidomide and everolimue is an off label use in multiple myeloma.
