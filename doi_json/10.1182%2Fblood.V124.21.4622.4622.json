    "abstract_text": "Introduction Recent advances in cancer genetics have led to the identification of somatic mutations in SET-binding protein 1 (SETBP1) in myeloid malignancies categorized as myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Heterozygous point mutations in SETBP1 are essentially found at a genomic level in myeloid malignancies, and the frequency of the mutated allele in cDNA suggests somatic heterozygosity without substantial imbalance in allelic expression. Thus, mutant SETBP1 presumably has a dominant altered biological activity. Most mutations in SETBP1 are located in the SKI homologous region. This region is suggested to include regions critical for ubiquitin binding and SETBP1 degradation. SETBP1 binds to SET, which protects against protease cleavage, and thus may result in PP2A inhibition and cell proliferation. Overexpression of SETBP1 resulting from a p.G870S alteration showed higher levels of the protein compared with wild-type (WT), indicating a prolonged halftime of SETBP1, which led to reduced PP2A activity and a higher cell proliferation rate. To date, however, our molecular biological understanding of SETBP1 mutations has been obtained only through observations of exogenous overexpression in cell lines. This may result in bias, considering the predicted dominant-negative function of SETBP1 mutations. Therefore, we used an RNA-guided endonuclease (RGEN), the CRISPR/Cas9 system, to generate a cell line harboring point mutations resulting in only relevant single amino acid substitutions in SETBP1. We analyzed cell signaling using the cell line thus established. Methods pSpCas9(BB) (PX330) was used to express humanized S. pyogenes Cas9 and gRNAs of interest. The gRNAs were designed by searching for NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences near the point mutation target sites. The candidate gRNAs were gRNA#1, 5\u2032-TAGGGAGCCAATCTCGCAC-3\u2032; gRNA#2, 5\u2032-TGTCCCAATGCCGCTGTCGC-3\u2032; gRNA#4, 5\u2032-GTCCCAATGCCGCTGTCGCT-3\u2032; and gRNA#7, 5\u2032-GAGACGATCCCCAGCGACAG-3\u2032. pCAG-EGxxFP harboring the 500 bp target region of WT SETBP1 was constructed for gRNA selection. For homology-dependent repair (HDR), we synthesized 70 mer single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssODN) having both the SETBP1 c.2602G>A, p.D868N mutation and synonymous mutation in the PAM. HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. For cell signaling analysis, the cells were serum-depleted for 16 h prior to western blotting. Anti-SETBP1 antibody (ab98222), anti-phospho-Y307 PP2A antibody (E155), and anti phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody (CST#4370) were used for cell signaling analysis. Results To validate an efficient sgRNA for DNA scission, we cotransfected pCAG-EGxxFP-SETBP1 and pSpCas9(BB)-SETBP1-gRNA plasmids into HEK293T cells. EGFP fluorescence, whose intensity is correlated with the efficacy of HDR, was observed 48 h later, and we determined that gRNA#2 was the most efficient. Next we cotransfected 293T cells with pCAG-EGxxFP-SETBP1, pSpCas9(BB)-SETBP1-gRNA#2, and ssODN for mutagenesis. Five days after transfection, single EGFP-positive clones were isolated using the FACSAria cell sorting system. Sanger sequencing confirmed that 293T cells harboring the SETBP1 p.D868N homozygous mutation were established. A clone with WT SETBP1 was also maintained as a control. To elucidate the effects of the SETBP1 mutation in 293T cells, we performed cell signaling analysis by western blotting. 293T-SETBP1 p.D868N cells showed higher levels of SETBP1 protein with lower molecular weight compared with WT, indicating a prolonged halftime, possibly due to loss of ubiquitination. In addition, 293T-SETBP1 p.D868N cells showed a higher phosphorylation level of PP2A (Y307, C subunit), a marker of PP2A inactivation. Finally, the phosphorylation level of p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) was increased in 293T-SETBP1 p.D868N cells. Conclusions We confirmed that the SETBP1 p.D868N mutation caused a prolonged halftime, resulting in PP2A inactivation and p44/42 MAPK activation in 293T cell lines. Our data suggest a potential therapy target for malignancies harboring SETBP1 mutations. More generally, this work illustrates the utility of RGEN technology for studying hematological malignancies.
