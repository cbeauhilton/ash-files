    "abstract_text": "Intensified treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has lead to increased survival rates of about 80%, however therapy fails in the remaining patients leading to relapse of the disease associated with inferior prognosis. Because treatment failure is, at least in part, due to defects in apoptosis programs, novel therapeutic strategies that counter apoptosis resistance are needed. \u201cInhibitor of Apoptosis\u201d (IAP) proteins block the apoptosis machinery at a central point and are highly expressed in acute leukemias, thereby providing a target structure for therapeutic intervention. Molecules antagonizing these apoptosis inhibitors, so called SMAC-mimetics, therefore provide a promising strategy to overcome apoptosis deficiency and effectively treat high risk ALL. In this study, we investigated the effects of the small molecule SMAC-mimetic BV6 (kindly provided by Genentech) in B cell precursor- (BCP-) ALL. BV6 showed a clear induction of cell death at nanomolar concentrations in ALL cell lines. ALL cells sensitive for SMAC-mimetic induced cell death showed rapid cIAP degradation, NFkB activation and secretion of TNF-alpha (TNF-a). Interestingly, mitochondrial perturbation and caspase activation could be inhibited by the soluble TNF-a receptor Etanercept indicating the induction of a TNF-a dependent feed forward loop by the SMAC-mimetic BV6. In addition to cell lines, we investigated the effects of BV6 on a series of 42 primary ALL samples isolated from ALL bearing mice of established patient derived NOD/SCID/huALL xenograft leukemias. Intriguingly, upon treatment with the small molecule SMAC mimetic BV6, induction of cell death was observed in a majority of 70% of all individual patient-derived leukemias and BV6 induced cell death was inhibited by Etanercept demonstrating TNF-a dependency also in primary ALL. We previously described that rapid engraftment of ALL cells transplanted onto NOD/SCID mice (short Time To Leukemia, TTL short ) is associated with deficient apoptosis signaling in the ALL cells and indicative for early patient relapse. Importantly, primary xenograft ALL samples with a TTL short /early relapse phenotype showed increased cell death upon treatment with SMAC-mimetic BV6 and activation of the constitutive deficient apoptosis signaling pathway, demonstrating that SMAC-mimetics induce intact apoptosis signaling in former apoptosis resistant primary ALL cells. Based on theses findings, we further evaluated the in vivo effectivity of the SMAC-mimetic BV6 on high risk ALL using our NOD/SCID/huALL xenograft model in a preclinical setting. ALL bearing recipients were treated with either BV6 or solvent for a given time of two weeks and further investigated for the presence of leukemia. Most interestingly, a significant delay of post-treatment leukemia reoccurrence was observed upon BV6 in vivo treatment along with a profound reduction of tumor load in the recipients compared to solvent treated animals. In a clinical setting, high-risk disease is unlikely to be treated by one compound alone. Therefore, we combined BV6 with multidrug chemotherapy resembling ALL induction treatment and observed a significant delay of ALL reoccurrence and prolonged survival of animals treated with the combination of the SMAC-mimetic and chemotherapy in contrast to chemotherapy alone. Most importantly, concomitant in vivo therapy with Etanercept revoked the cell death sensitizing effect of BV6, both in single treatment and in combination with chemotherapy. This indicates that BV6 induced apoptosis sensitization involves signaling via TNF-a and thereby provides a potential biomarker for the identification of patients who would benefit from SMAC-mimetic treatment. Taken together, we show that the small molecule SMAC-mimetic BV6 induces cell death via a TNF-a loop ex vivo and in vivo in primary patient-derived ALL. Moreover, BV6 is able to overcome apoptosis deficiency of high risk ALL leading to prolonged in vivo survival in a preclinical therapy model of patient-derived ALL xenograft ALL. Thus, induction of cell death by new generation small molecule SMAC-mimetics provides a promising novel strategy for targeted therapy of high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia and involvement of TNF-a signaling in BV6-sensitive patients points to its potential use as biomarker indicating effective cell death sensitization.
