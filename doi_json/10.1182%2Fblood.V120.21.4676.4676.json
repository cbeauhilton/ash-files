    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4676 Introduction Myeloproliferative diseases (MPDs) are a group of haematological disorders characterized by the hyper proliferation of different blood cells in peripheral blood and other hematopoietic organs. The clinical heterogenity of these neoplasms reflects the different gene pathways involved, most of which are only partially known. Given the genetic homology and the physiological similarity to mammals, zebrafish has emerged as an ideal model to study human normal and malignant haematopoiesis. In the last decade several oncogenes involved in the development of hematopoietic neoplasms have been used to model leukemia in zebrafish with the aim to discovery new molecular pathways involved in malignant transformation. Despite the first encouraging results these experimental models failed to fully recapitulate human myeloproliferative disorders. Methods We took advantage of the Gal4/UAS binary system to induce the expression of human oncogenic HRASV12G in the zebrafish hematopoietic compartment. We used a specific transgenic line that drives oncogene expression in zebrafish early hematopoietic progenitors under control of the FLI.1 (Friend Leukemia virus Integration 1) promoter. Results We observed the development of a myelo-erythroid proliferative disease in few days in zebrafish transgenic larva. The pathological phenotype is characterized by the expansion of the hematopoietic tissue, an increased expression of myelo-erythroid specific genes (PU.1, gata1, mpx, c-mpl) associated with a slight increase of staminality markers (lmo2, scl, c-myb, runx.1), and a higher number of l-plastin expressing cells. Moreover blood smear of pathological larva displayed leukemic blasts and the arrest of erythrocyte differentiation whereas kidney marrow of juvenile fish displayed abnormal myelopoiesis characterized by the increase of erythro-myeloid progenitors. We found that the pathological phenotype is associated with a down regulation of the Notch pathway as shown by the decreased gene expression of notch pathways target genes (notch1, notch3, her6). Furthermore we discovered a novel set of genes involved in neoplastic transformation induced by HRASV12 expression through RNA-Seq analysis of pathological larva. Conclusions The expansion of the zebrafish hematopoietic compartment characterized by the hyper-proliferation of the myelo-erythroid progenitors that we found in this model reproduces some of the pathological features of human myeloproliferative disorders. This study showed that forcing oncogene expression in the hemogenic endothelial cells induces the transdifferentiation of the early hemogenic pluripotent stem cells into abnormal myeloerythoid progenitors by repressing the Notch pathways. Transcriptome analysis identified a number of potential effectors of this transformation. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
