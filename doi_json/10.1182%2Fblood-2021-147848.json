    "abstract_text": "Hemogen, also known as EDAG, is a hematopoietic tissue-specific gene that regulates the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. However, the mechanism underlying hemogen function in erythropoiesis is unclear. We found that depletion of hemogen in human CD34 + erythroid progenitor cells and HUDEP2 cells significantly reduced the expression of genes associated with heme and hemoglobin synthesis, supporting a positive role of hemogen in erythroid maturation. In human K562 cells, hemogen antagonized the occupancy of co-repressors NuRD complex and facilitated LDB1 complex-mediated chromatin looping. Hemogen recruited SWI/SNF complex ATPase BRG1 as a co-activator to regulate nucleosome accessibility and H3K27ac enrichment for promoter and enhancer activity. To ask if hemogen/BRG1 cooperativity is conserved in mammalian systems, we generated hemogen KO/KI mice and investigated hemogen/BRG1 function in murine erythropoiesis. Loss of hemogen in E12.5-E16.5 impeded erythroid differentiation through reducing the production of mature erythroblasts. ChIP-seq in WT and hemogen KO animal revealed BRG1 is largely dependent on hemogen to occupy chromatin at erythroid gene promoters and enhancers. In summary, hemogen/BRG1 interaction in mammals is essential for erythroid maturation and hemoglobin production through its active role in promoter and enhancer activity and chromatin organization.
