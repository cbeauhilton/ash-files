    "abstract_text": "Abstract 576 Stat3 appears to play a critical role in sustaining and generating memory B-cells and long-lived plasma cells (PCs) the normal counterparts of myeloma cells. In contrast to the transient nature of Stat3 activation in normal cells, many hematological tumors including multiple myeloma (MM) harbor constitutive Stat3 activity. Aberrant STAT signaling is recognized as a master regulator of direct and indirect tumor processes including proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, angiogenesis and cancer inflammation and thus Stat3 represents an important therapeutic target. Using structure-based design, targeting the phosphotyrosine (pY)-SH2 domain interactions that stabilizes active Stat3 dimers, phosphopeptides have been identified that block Stat3 dimerization and DNA binding activity. Peptidic agents however suffer from limited cell permeability and metabolic lability, properties that have restricted their practical application in vivo at therapeutic doses. Here we describe the dependence of myeloma tumors on Stat3 and characterize the anti-tumor activity of BP-2-047, a novel, non-phosphorylated small molecule with reduced peptidic character. We analyzed the activity of Stat3 using a Stat3 gene expression index based on Stat3 target genes in 60 human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs). Several available myeloma cell lines (XG6, XG7, JJN3 and UTMC2) demonstrated elevated STAT3 gene expression signatures (2.3 to 14.8) with confirmed constitutive Stat3 phosphorylation by Western blot analysis. RNA interference revealed that Stat3 is essential for XG6, JJN3, and UTMC2 survival. We similarly analyzed the activity of Stat3 in publicly available gene expression profile data sets derived from newly diagnosed MM patients. Approximately a third of patients demonstrated a functionally significant level of Stat3 signature, comparable to those in the Stat3-dependent cell lines. We next evaluated the anti-myeloma activity of the BP-2-047 in cell-based assays against a panel of HMCLs with high and low STAT3 activity. BP-2-047 delivered a desirable activity profile for targeted therapy. Consistent with its predicted mechanism of action, we observed dose-dependent inhibition of Tyr705Stat3 phosphorylation in XG6, XG7, JJN3 and UTMC2 cells, presumably through the blockade of Stat3 binding to the pTyr motifs of gp130 and the prevention of de novo phosphorylation by JAKs. Using a luciferase reporter assay we confirmed inhibition of Stat3 transcriptional activity in MM cells stably expressing the Stat3-dependent luciferase reporter (pLucTKS3). Inhibition of transcription was associated with decreased expression of short half-life proteins, c-Myc and Mcl-1. BP-2-047 inhibited viability of myeloma tumors with IC 50 values of 3.1\u20137.4 microM, in cell lines with constitutive Stat3 activity. Inhibition of Stat3 phosphorylation resulted in induction of dose-dependent apoptosis as determined by PI/annexin V staining and PARP cleavage. However, cells were resistant to BP-2-047-induced apoptosis when co-cultured with bone marrow stroma cells. Identification of factors that confer survival advantage in the presence of stroma is in progress. Exposure of MM patient derived bone marrow mononuclear cells to < 15 microM BP-2-047 preferentially induced apoptosis of CD138 + MM cells. In contrast, BP-2-047 at concentrations of 30 microM failed to inhibit normal bone marrow-derived CD34 colony formation. In vitro combination studies in cell lines demonstrate synergy with dexamethasone, bortezomib and lenalidomide. Studies assessing in vivo activity of BP-2-047 as a single agent and in combination with bortezomib against Stat3 activated myeloma tumors in xenograft mice are ongoing and will be reported. These data suggest that Stat3 may represent an important therapeutic target in a subset of myeloma patients and supports innovative drug development with a focus on Stat3.
