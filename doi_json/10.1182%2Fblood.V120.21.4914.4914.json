Methods Cytotoxicity of drug was detected by the MTT assay in the IM-sensitive cell line K562 and IM-resistant cell line K562R. Western Blot assay were employed to examine the expression of p-cAbl, p-Lyn, p-STAT5, ERK signaling pathway (p-cRaf, p-MEK, p-ERK), PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway(p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-4EBP1) and the apoptosis related proteins (Bax, Bcl2). The apoptosis rates were analyzed by Annexin V/PI double staining flow cytometry assay. The levels of lyn and erk1/2 gene were assayed by RT-PCR. Results 1. BCR-ABL-independent activation of Lyn and ERK1/2 may be the IM resistant mechanism in K562R cell line. The IC50 value of K562R cell line(1. 505\u00b10. 459 \u03bcmol/L) inhibited by imatinib for 72 hours was higher than the values of K562(0. 159\u00b10. 032\u03bcmol/L) and the Resistant Fold(RF)was 9. 465. Western Blot assays showed that p-Lyn, p-MEK and p-ERK of ERK pathway, p-mTOR and p-4EPB1 were over-expressed in K562R cell line relative to K562 cell line. However, the levels of p-cAbl, p-STAT5, p-Raf, p-AKT of PI3K/AKT/mTOR were similar in the K562R and K562 cell lines. The treatment of IM could reduce the expression of p-cAbl and p-MEK, but not that of p-Lyn, p-ERK, p-mTOR, p-4EBP1, and even up-regulate the p-Lyn, p-ERK, p-mTOR. The expression of Bax, Bcl2 and the apoptosis rates were the similar in both cell lines. 2. MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 could reverse the IM resistance in K562R cell line. MTT assay showed single-agent U0126 is more sensitive to K562R than K562. The IC 50 values of the two cell lines were 34. 235\u00b15. 658 \u03bcmol/L and 85. 824\u00b14. 474 \u03bcmol/L respectively. The combination of imatinib and U0126 markedly enhanced inhibitory effect as measured by MTT assay in K562R cell line, combination with 10\u03bcmol/L U0126, the IC 50 values of IM was 0. 134\u00b10. 059\u03bcmol/L, which reduced to 8. 9% of single IM treatment. 3. The reversing mechanism of U0126 to imatinib resistance in K562R cell line. Western Blot showed single IM up-regulated the p-Lyn and p-ERK, while U0126 reduced the expression of them, the combination of the IM and U0126 could synergisticly reduce the p-Lyn expression and neutralize the up-regulation of p-ERK caused by IM single agent. Single IM also up-regulated the p-mTOR in K562R while U0126 reduced it, single IM or U0126 had no influence on p-4EBP1 in K562R, the combination of the two drugs could synergisticly reduce the p-4EBP1 and neutralize the up-regulation of p-mTOR caused by IM single agent. IM but not U0126could reduce p-cAbl and the combination of the two was more effective than IM treatment. IM alone or combination with U0126 could not regulate p-STAT5 expression in K562R. RT-PCR showed that neither IM treatment nor its combination with U0126 could change the level of lyn and erk1, 2 gene in the cell lines. Conclusions 1. BCR-ABL-independent activation of Lyn and ERK1/2 involved in IM resistance mechanism in IM-resistant K562R cell line. Imatinib alone could up-regulated the expression of the p-Lyn, p-ERK, p-mTOR in K562R cell line. MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 could reverse the IM resistance by reducing the expression of the p-Lyn, p-ERK, p-mTOR, p-4EBP1 of IM-resistant K562R cell line, and the combination of U0216 and Imatinib could synergisticly depress up-regulation of the p-Lyn, p-ERK, p-mTOR and p-4EBP1 caused by IM.
