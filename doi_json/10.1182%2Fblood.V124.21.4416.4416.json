    "abstract_text": "Background Baseline levels of peripheral absolute neutrophil (ANC), lymphocyte (ALC) and monocyte (AMC) counts have prognostic value in solid tumors. There are limited data on their impact on outcomes in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The present study is to confirm whether the baseline levels of peripheral ANC, ALC and AMC can predict outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL. Patients and Methods Data from lymphoma database at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) were used. The correlation of baseline ANC, AMC and ALC with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed in 817 newly diagnosed previously untreated patients with DLBCL who received frontline treatments at UTMDACC between 2000-2011. Kaplan-Meier method was used for time-to event analysis including PFS and OS. Multi Cox proportional hazards model were fitted to evaluate important patient characteristics on the time-to event endpoints. Results Median ages at diagnoses were 58 years (range, 18 to 91 years). Seventy-nine percent of patients received conventional immunochemotherapy(CHOP-R) while 21 % of patients had intensive immunochemotherapy (HyperCVAD-R or R-EPOCH) or intensive chemotherapy(n=5; HyperCVAD or R-EPOCH) due to CD 20 negative; two patients received radiation therapy only. IPI low, intermediate and high were 38%, 46% and 16%, respectively. Overall response rate was 98% with a complete remission rate of 73%. Patients with abnormal ANC (> 7.3 X10 9 /L) had an inferior PFS ( P <0.001) and OS ( P <0.001) compared to patients with ANC \u2264 7.3 X10 9 /L; patients with abnormal ALC (< 1.0 X10 9 /L) had significant short PFS ( P <0.001) and OS ( P <0.001) compared to patients with ALC \u2265 1.0 X10 9 /L; similarly, patients with abnormal AMC (> 0.7X10 9 /L) had inferior PFS ( P < 0.001) and OS ( P < 0.001) compared to patients with AMC\u2264 0.7 X10 9 /L. Multivariate analysis identified abnormal ALC and AMC as an independent adverse prognostic factors for PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.39 and 1.49, respectively; P <0.016 and P =0.004, respectively) and abnormal ANC and AMC as an independent adverse prognostic factors for OS ( P =0.017 and P =0.024, respectively; HR 1.56 and 1.42, respectively). Conclusions An abnormal Neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte counts in peripheral blood are independent, poor prognostic factor for PFS and OS in patients with DLBCL. Incorporation of these immunological markers into IPI prognostic model may improve outcome prediction. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
