    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2408 Purpose: Vitamin D insufficiency is common globally and in the United States. Approximately 25\u201350% of patients seen in routine clinical practice have vitamin D levels below the optimal range with low levels linked to higher cancer incidence. Although vitamin D insufficiency is also related to inferior prognosis in some cancers, no data exists for chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL). Patients and Methods: To test the hypothesis that vitamin D levels predict outcome in patients with CLL, we evaluated the relationship of 25 (OH)D serum levels with time-to-treatment (TTT) and overall survival (OS) in 390 newly diagnosed CLL patients participating in a prospective cohort study (discovery cohort) and separate cohort of 153 previously untreated patients participating in an observational study (confirmation cohort). 25 (OH)D levels were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were all <7% (data not shown). All vitamin D assays were performed on stored research samples; results were not included in the clinical record and were not known to the treating physicians in either study. Vitamin D insufficiency was defined as a serum 25 (OH)D level <25 ng/mL (62.5 nmol/L), an accepted level 3 for the establishment of hypovitaminosis D and the threshold used in routine clinical practice to identify individuals with 25 (OH)D insufficiency by our laboratory in routine clinical practice ( http://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com ). Results: We evaluated the relationship of 25 (OH)D serum levels with time-to-treatment (TTT) and overall survival (OS) in newly diagnosed CLL patients participating in a prospective cohort study (discovery cohort) and a separate cohort of previously untreated patients participating in an observational study (confirmation cohort). Of 390 CLL patients in the discovery cohort, 119 (30.5%) were 25 (OH)D insufficient. 25 (OH)D insufficiency had no relationship with CD38, ZAP-70, CD49d or IGHV mutation status and had no relationship with FISH risk category as classified using the Dohner system. After median follow-up of 3 years, TTT (hazard ratio [HR]=1.66; p=0.005) and OS (HR=2.39; p=0.01) were shorter for 25 (OH)D insufficient patients ( figure ). We next attempted to validate these findings in an independent group of previously untreated CLL patients. In the validation cohort, 61 of 153 patients (39.9%) were 25 (OH)D insufficient. After median follow-up of 9.9 years, TTT (HR=1.59; p=0.05) and OS (HR 1.63; p=0.06) were again shorter for 25 (OH)D insufficient patients. On pooled multivariable analysis of patients in both cohorts adjusting for age, sex, stage, CD38, ZAP-70, IGHV, CD49d, and FISH, 25 (OH)D insufficiency remained an independent predictor of TTT (HR=1.47; p=0.008). On multivariable analysis for OS, the HR for death associated with 25 (OH)D insufficiency was similar to univariate findings although the p value did not reach the threshold of statistical significance (HR=1.47; 95% CI=0.97\u20132.23; p=0.07). Conclusion: 25 (OH)D insufficiency is associated with inferior TTT and OS in CLL patients. Whether normalizing vitamin D levels in deficient CLL patients would improve outcome merits clinical testing.
