    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3678 The JAK/STAT pathway is becoming a relevant target for lymphoma therapy and inhibitors of the pathway are now in clinical trial. It would be ideal to identify patients for trial by assessment of pathway activation. We analyzed the primary tumors from 50 patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) using antibody against phosphorylated tyrosine signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) revealed that 52% (21/40) of DLBCL tumors express tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3). There are several potential mechanisms of activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Protein tyrosine phosphatases such as SHP1 are key negative regulators of this pathway. SHP-1 is also considered a tumor suppressor gene because of its ability to antagonize the action of tyrosine kinases. Persistent activation of STAT3 seems to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of several malignancies. In an attempt to determine mechanism of STAT3 phosphorylation, we analyzed SHP1 expression and its correlation to STAT3 phosphorylation in DLBCL tumors. We analyzed SHP1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a tissue microarray composed of 27 DLBCL tumor samples. SHP1 was found silenced in 33% (7/27) of DLBCL cases. To confirm our IHC data SHP1 mRNA expression was also analyzed in DLBCL patients (n=7) and CD19+ normal B cells (n=3) using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). SHP1 expression was found silenced in 57% (4/7) of cases, however normal B cells expressed a significant amount of SHP1 mRNA transcripts. We next sought to determine the mechanism of SHP1 silencing in these patients. DNA methylation is the most common mechanism of gene silencing and gene inactivation in human cancers and methylation of a cluster of CPG sites near the proximal SHP1 promoter 2 has been shown in myeloma and T cell lymphoma cells. We analyzed the frequency of SHP1 DNA methylation in 40 DLBCL patients and in DLBCL cell lines by analyzing the proximal promoter regions for SHP1 with methylation specific (MSP) and unmethylation specific (UMSP) PCR primers. We found SHP1 methylation in 2.5% (1/40) DLBCL tumors and none of the DLBCL cell lines tested (OCILy3, OCILy10, SUDHL2, SUDHL6, OCILy19 and OCILy1) were positive for methylation. Furthermore, bisulphite sequencing of the MSP product confirmed methylated cytosines in the one MSP-positive DLBCL patient sample and in the positive control (methylated DNA). We next confirmed our MSP methylation results in the 40 DLBCL tumors DNA with a high resolution melting (HRM) methylation array for accurate detection of changes in the CpG methylation. The primers were designed to flank CpG islands, not to specifically amplify (converted) methylated or unmethylated DNA (as in MSP PCR). Data were normalized to an unmethylated control. Based on the melting profile, there was no methylation in the controls but detectable methylation (>5%) in the SHP1 promoter region was found in 10% (4/40) of DLBCL samples. The one sample that was positive with MSP PCR was also >50% methylated by HRM. Next we analyzed whether there is any correlation between SHP1 expression and tyrosine phoshorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3). In the 27 cases of DLBCL studied, 16 were pSTAT3 negative and 11 were pSTAT3 positive by IHC. 50% (8/16) of the pSTAT3 negative cases had very high expression of SHP1. Similarly, 45 % (5/11) of pSTAT3 positive cases were SHP1 negative consistent with loss of SHP1 gene expression. These data suggest that loss of SHP1 expression is one of several potential mechanisms that can contribute to increased tyrosine STAT3 activation in DLBCL. In addition, these data suggest that CPG island promote r hypermethylation in the SHP1 promoter is not associated with SHP1 gene silencing in DLBCL tumors.
