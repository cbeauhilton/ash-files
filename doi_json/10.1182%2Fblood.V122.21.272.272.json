    "abstract_text": "Background The C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) plays a crucial role in modulating the biology of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. Recent whole genome sequencing studies have identified unique CXCR4 mutations in 29% of the 55 evaluated patients with Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM). In this study, we sought to better define the mutation status of CXCR4 in B-cell malignancies and define the functional role of this mutation in the progression of WM in vivo. Methods Allele-specific(AS) PCR has been performed on bone marrow (BM)-derived tumor cells of patients with WM (n: 131); IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS; n: 40); as well as in patients with diffuse large cell lymphomas (DLBCL; n: 75), splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL; n: 14), B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL; n: 37), hairy cell leukemia (HCL; n: 35), multiple myeloma (MM; n: 36), IgA/IgG MGUS (n: 22), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma without WM criteria (n: 13), and amyloidosis (n: 6). CXCR4-loss and -gain of function studies have been performed on WM cells stably expressing either shRNA-CXCR4, CXCR4-ORF-GFP-tagged or scramble-RFP-tagged (generated via lentivirus-based infection). A mutagenesis kit has been used to generate the C1013GCXCR4 mutant protein ( C1013GCXCR4 ) in WM cells, via lentivirus-based infection. CXCR4-knock-in or C1013GCXCR4 -mutated cells and the corresponding controls have been injected i.v. into SCID/Bg mice and tumor dissemination has been evaluated ex vivo by immunohistochemistry IHC (human-CD20; -CXCR4). C1013GCXCR4 -mutated cells have been characterized at mRNA levels (U133 plus2) using GSEA. A novel human anti-CXCR4 mAb (BMS-936564/MDX-1338; Bristol Myers Squibb, NY) has been tested in vitro (cell proliferation, MTT, adhesion and migration to primary WM BM mesenchymal stromal cells) and in vivo (10mg/kg i.p. x3-4/week). Tumor growth has been evaluated by IHC ex vivo (hCD20; hCXCR4) and by immunofluorescence. Results We examined the mutational status of C1013GCXCR4 and confirmed the presence of this specific mutation in 28% of the 131 cases evaluated. The mutation was also detected at the stage of IgM-MGUS (20%); while it was present in a minority of patients with DLBCL (1%) and SMZL (7%). Remarkably, it was absent in all MM (n=36) and IgA/IgG MGUS patients (n=22), and it was not detected in healthy subjects (n=32). The functional relevance of the C1013G-CXCR4 variant was next examined in vivo. Mice injected with C1013GCXCR4- cells presented with a significant dissemination of tumor cells, demonstrating involvement of liver, bone marrow, lymph nodes, kidney and lung. IHC showed the presence of CXCR4+ and CD20+ cells in all the tissues examined; and quantification of CXCR4 and CD20 positivity was higher in C1013GCXCR4- cells-, compared to parental(p)-WM cell-injected mice (NIS Elements software, Nikon, Melville, NY; P<0.05). In addition, C1013GCXCR4- cells were further characterized in vitro, showing increased adhesion and cell proliferation in the presence of primary WM BM-MSCs. These findings were also confirmed using CXCR4-overexpressing cells. In contrast CXCR4-knock-down cells presented the opposite behavior, where reduced adhesion and proliferation in presence of primary WM BM-MSCs were observed. By performing GSEA we demonstrated that genes related to invasiveness, cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, and oncogenesis were all enriched in C1013GCXCR4- cells compared to the parental-WM cells. These findings let us hypothesize that C1013GCXCR4 may act as an activating mutation in WM cells. Indeed, in a different mouse model, CXCR4 over-expressing cells and scramble infected cells were injected into mice, showing similar phenotype to the one observed upon C1013GCXCR4 -WM cell-injected-mice. Finally, the novel antibody BMS-936564/MDX-1338 exerted anti-WM activity both in vitro and in vivo, with anti-tumor effects observed also against the mutated variant. This was supported by inhibition of pro-survival pathways (p-ERK; pAKT); induction of pro-apototic proteins (cleaved-PARP and -caspase-9); up-regulation of p-GSK3beta, p-beta catenin and relative beta catenin degradation. Conclusion These findings demonstrate that C1013GCXCR4 acts as an activating mutation in WM; and it is targetable by using MDX936564/1338 thus providing the basis for translating these observations into clinical trials for WM patients.
