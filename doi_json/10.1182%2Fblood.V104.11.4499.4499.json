    "abstract_text": "Over many centuries, herbal remedies have treated a variety of ailments. This empiric observational approach has produced a number of leads for formulated medicines. We have examined five phytochemical herbs with purported anti-cancer activities: Ganoderma lucidum, Isatis indigotica, Dendranthema morifolium, Rabdosia rubescens and Panax pseudoginseng . Ethanol and DMSO extracts were made of each herb, and these were screened for their antiproliferative activities (MTT-assay; doses: 50 \u03bcg/ml and 100 \u03bcg/ml) using a panel of 26 human cancer cell lines (16 hematologic cell lines). Ganoderma lucidum was the most effective agent, particularly against the 16 hematological cell lines. Further dose- and time-response MTT assays of Ganoderma were performed using the 7 most sensitive hematological cell lines: their ED 50 \u2019s were 26 \u03bcg/ml, HL-60; 63 \u03bcg/ml, U937; 50 \u03bcg/ml, K562 (all three are myeloid leukemias); 38 \u03bcg/ml, Blin-1; 30 \u03bcg/ml, Nalm-6 (both are B-ALLs); 40 \u03bcg/ml, RPMI8226 (multiple myeloma); 20 \u03bcg/ml, Daudi (Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma). Cell cycle analysis revealed a G2/M arrest, most prominently in HL-60 cells (24% in G2/M compared to 12% in control cells cultured with 100 mg/ml Ganoderma for 3 days). Three hematological cell lines (HL-60, U937, Blin-1) were examined for apoptosis, which ranged between 10% \u2013 35% and 30% \u2013 49% compared to <6% in control cells after exposure to 100 and 200 mg/ml Ganoderma for 3 days, respectively (Annexin V staining). Of particular note, cytospin preparations of HL-60 cells revealed that Ganoderma lucidum caused prominent multinucleation. Dose-dependent studies revealed 1% multinucleation in the cells treated with 1 mg/ml, 5% with 10 mg/ml, 10% with 50 mg/ml, 40% with 75 mg/ml and 80% with 100 mg/ml Ganoderma at day 4 of culture. FACS analysis of PI stained HL-60 cells confirmed the increased DNA content of these cells. Of interest, multinucleation did not occur in 6 other hematologic and 6 solid tumor cell lines. In summary, we discovered that 5 phytochemical herbs have growth inhibitory effects on AML, CML, B-ALL, Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma and multiple myeloma cell lines. The most effective drug was Ganoderma lucidum , and it induced cell death by apoptosis. Moreover, multinucleation was observed in HL-60 cells, which may provide interesting insight in the same process in normal cells, like megakaryocytes. Notably, these studies have identified one plant, Ganoderma lucidum , that deserves careful separation techniques to identify its anticancer molecule (s).",
