    "abstract_text": "HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using CD34 + selected cells is a widely used procedure, which, however, is complicated by delayed immune reconstitution. We recently developed a new method of graft manipulation based on the physical removal of \u03b1\u03b2 + T cells and CD19 + B cells, which permits to leave mature natural killer (NK) cells and \u03b3\u03b4 + T cells in the graft. These cells can exert a graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect and reduce the risk of infection. In particular, unconventional \u03b3\u03b4 T cells play a critical role in both innate and adaptive immunity and exert HLA-unrestricted cytotoxicity against both solid and hematological tumors, thus potentially acting as beneficial effector cells in transplanted patients. Moreover, such grafts may limit the risk of graft-versus-host disease and prevent EBV-related lymphoproliferative disease. We performed phenotypic and functional studies on \u03b3\u03b4 T cells collected from 20 pediatric patients (pts, 13 males, 7 females, median age 10 years, range 6 months to 16 years) that received this type of allograft. Eighteen pts had acute leukemia and 2 non-malignant disorders. Ex vivo assays of peripheral blood \u03b3\u03b4 T cell phenotype and function were performed weekly until Hospital discharge and monthly until 6 months after HSCT. Phenotype of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was analysed by flow cytometry. Analyses were performed on mononuclear cells labelled with mAb panels (CD3, CD45, pan-\u03b3\u03b4, anti-V\u03b41, -V\u03b42, -V\u03b39, CD45RO, CD45RA, CD27, CD16, CD56) allowing the identification of the main \u03b3\u03b4 + T cell subsets, including V\u03b41 + and V\u03b42 + cells, na\u00efve , central memory (CM), effector memory (EM) and terminally differentiated (TD) \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Functional studies were performed using \u03b3\u03b4 T cells shortly after collection from pts, as well as after in vitro expansion with zoledronic acid and IL-2 for 10 days. Cytotoxic activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was tested against primary leukemia cells, through CD107a degranulation assay and/or standard 51 Cr-release assay. In the first 4 weeks after HSCT, T cells were consistently of the \u03b3\u03b4 subset (>90% of CD45+CD3+ cells); by contrast, \u03b1\u03b2+ T cells gradually increased over time. In approximately half of the pts, the percentage of \u03b1\u03b2 T cells exceeded that of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells already starting from 30 days after HSCT. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells consisted of V\u03b42 + V\u03b39 + and V\u03b41 + V\u03b39 +/- cells, and marginally of the V\u03b41 - V\u03b42 - V\u03b39 - population. Detailed phenotypic characterization of V\u03b41 + and V\u03b42 + \u03b3\u03b4 T cells revealed that, at day +20 after HSCT, 44% of V\u03b41 + cells were CM (identified as CD45RO + CD27 + cells), 26% na\u00efve (CD45RO - CD27 + ), 21.4% TD (CD45RO - CD27 - ) and 6.1% EM (CD45RO + CD27 - ). Similarly, 55.4% of V\u03b42 + \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes were CM, 9.8% na\u00efve, 11.4% TD and 23.1% EM. The proportion of the different V\u03b42 + \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subset did not change significantly over time, especially when comparing that present at day +20 after HSCT (time point, TP1) with that measured 30 days after the attainment of a 1:1 ratio of \u03b1\u03b2-to- \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (TP2) ( Figure 1 , left panel). By contrast, by comparing TP1 and TP2, we found that V\u03b41 + CM \u03b3\u03b4 T cells decreased and EM cells increased over time, while na\u00efve or TD V\u03b41 + \u03b3\u03b4 T cells did not change ( Figure 1 , right panel). In transplanted pts experiencing cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells mostly consisted of V\u03b41 + cells (mean 59.8% of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells), among which 49% were TD, 22.7% EM, 18.9% CM and 10.1% na\u00efve. Noteworthy, in transplanted pts who did not have CMV reactivation, the main \u03b3\u03b4 T cells showed a V\u03b42 + phenotype. Functional studies revealed that pt-derived \u03b3\u03b4 T cells consistently expanded in vitro after exposure to zoledronic acid and IL-2, the resulting V\u03b39V\u03b42 population expressing mainly an EM phenotype. These V\u03b39V\u03b42 cells exerted cytotoxic activities against primary allogeneic leukemia cells, especially when leukemia cells were pre-treated with zoledronic acid ( Figure 2 ). More importantly, both V\u03b41 + and V\u03b42 + \u03b3\u03b4 T cells obtained from transplanted pts showed cytotoxic activity against primary leukemia cells, as assessed by CD107a degranulation assay. In conclusion, we provide the first phenotypic and functional characterization of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, analyzed over time in children transplanted with grafts depleted of \u03b1\u03b2+ T cells and of B lymphocytes. Our results support the concept that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are important effector cells, which can be expanded and activated after exposure to bisphosphonates and IL-2 with the aim of improving their killing capacity against leukemia cells.
