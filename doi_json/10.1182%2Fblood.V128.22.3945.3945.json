    "abstract_text": "Aberrant gene expression is a hallmark of acute leukemias. However, therapeutic strategies for its blockade are generally lacking, in large part due to the pharmacologic challenges of drugging transcription factors. MYB-driven gene trans-activation with CREB-binding protein (CBP) is required for the initiation and maintenance of a variety of acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemias, including refractory MLL-rearranged leukemias. Using structure-guided molecular design, we developed a prototypical peptidomimetic inhibitor MYBMIM that interferes with the assembly of the molecular MYB:CBP complex at \u03bcM concentrations and rapidly accumulates in the nuclei of AML cells. We found that treatment of AML cells with MYBMIM, but not with its inactive near-isosteric analogue TG3, led to the displacement and dissociation of MYB:CBP complex in cells, causing rapid downregulation of MYB-dependent gene expression including MYC and BCL2 oncogenes. This was associated with obliteration of H3K27Ac-driven oncogenic enhancers induced by CBP and enriched for MYB binding sites (Figure 1A; p =1e-118). Both human MLL-rearranged and non-rearranged AML cells, but not normal CD34+ umbilical cord blood progenitor cells, underwent sustained mitochondrial apoptosis in response to MYBMIM treatment, an effect that could be partially blocked by ectopic expression of BCL2 . We observed that MYBMIM treatment (50 mg/kg/day) impeded leukemia progression and extended survival of immunodeficient mice engrafted with primary patient-derived MLL-rearranged leukemia cells (Figure 1B; p =3.8e-3). These findings emphasize the exquisite dependence of human AML on MYB:CBP transcriptional dysregulation, and establish a pharmacologic approach for its therapeutic blockade.
