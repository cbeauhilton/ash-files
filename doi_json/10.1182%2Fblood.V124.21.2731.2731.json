    "abstract_text": "Chronic idiopathic neutropenia (CIN) is an acquired disorder of granulopoiesis characterized by prolonged neutropenia, mainly affecting middle-age females of the HLA-DRB1*1302 type. The defective hematopoiesis in CIN can be mainly attributed to accelerated Fas-mediated death of the CD34 + /CD33 + granulocytic progenitors, secondary to an inflammatory bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Crucial to CIN pathogenesis are the increased numbers of activated T cells identified in both peripheral blood (PB) and BM of CIN patients, supporting an immune pathogenesis. Using Sanger sequencing, we previously reported that the T-cell receptor (TR) gene repertoire in CIN is skewed, indicating antigen selection in CIN ontogeny. However, the analytical depth afforded by Sanger sequencing is limited, hindering definitive conclusions. In order to obtain a truly comprehensive view into the role of antigen drive in CIN, using next generation sequencing (NGS) we interrogated the TR repertoire of 13 patients (8 females, 5 males) included in our previous study as well as a healthy female. TRBV-TRBD-TRBJ gene rearrangements were amplified according to the BIOMED2 protocol on either genomic DNA or cDNA isolated from CD8 + cells of PB (n=4) or BM (n=10) samples. PCR products were used as a substrate for paired-end sample preparation (Illumina) and subjected to NGS on the MiSeq Illumina Platform. The raw NGS data were preprocessed with a dedicated pipeline for this purpose, including: (i) quality filtering of each read; (ii) merging of paired-end reads via local alignment; (iii) preparation of fasta files for submission to the IMGT/High V-QUEST tool; and, (iv) IMGT/High V-QUEST metadata analysis, interpretation and visualization. Overall, 6,196,980 TRBV-TRBD-TRBJ gene rearrangements were analyzed (130,020-1,037,680 /case) of which 5,317,609 were productive since they used functional TRBV genes and also carried in-frame CDR3. Rearrangements with identical TRBV gene usage and CDR3 sequence were defined as clonotypes. For repertoire analyses, clonotypes rather than single rearrangement sequences were considered. Overall, 553,145 unique clonotypes were identified (median 39,510; range 7,732-172,253/case), of which 408,744 represented singletons. All clonotypes from the Sanger analysis were detected by NGS as well. Among the 46 functional TRBV genes identified, the most frequent were: TRBV29-1 (13.9%), TRBV19 (6.7%), TRBV12-3 (5.6%), TRBV6-5 (5.4%), TRBV27 (4.9%) and TRBV6-1 (4.0%), collectively accounting for 40,5% of the TRBV repertoire; the TRBV29-1 gene predominated in 9/13 CIN cases. All CIN cases were found to carry distinct expanded clonotypes (median 10,314; range 2,279-40,245/case). The predominant clonotype ranged in frequency from 5.25 to 20.2% of the total clonotypes observed in each case. This contrasts significantly (p<0.001) with a 0.47% frequency of the dominant clonotype in the healthy control. Cluster analysis of the sequences of all CIN cases identified 9034 different clonotypes shared by different patients and, thus, deemed as public. Notably, public clonotypes of a given CDR3 length could show high sequence similarity, further underscoring the restricted nature of the repertoire. As an example, 1632/2665 (61.2%) public clonotypes with 12 aminoacid-long CDR3 were grouped into 168 distinct communities, populated with 2-280 highly similar sequences, each linked with 1 aminoacid distance with at least another member of the community. Overall, the present study offers conclusive evidence that the TR repertoire in CIN is remarkably skewed. The finding of oligoclonal T-cell expansions and public clonotypes strongly indicates that antigen-driven immune responses are very likely implicated in the pathogenesis of CIN.
