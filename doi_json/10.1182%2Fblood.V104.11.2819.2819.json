    "abstract_text": "Acquired pure red cell aplasia (APRCA) is associated with a number of conditions including malignancies, infections and autoimmune disorders. APRCA also occurs in patients with T-LGLL. It is postulated that suppression of erythropoiesis in T-LGLL is related to the immune destruction of erythroid precursors by the LGL clone. We hypothesize that APRCA can be associated with clonal T-cell expansion without pathological evidence of T-LGLL. Methods: We identified patients who were diagnosed with APRCA and had clonal TCR gene rearrangements. Clinical course, bone marrow pathology and flow cytometry data were reviewed. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on available bone marrow biopsies using antibodies to CD3, CD8, CD20 and the cytotoxic granule proteins TIA-1 and granzyme B. Clonal TCR gene rearrangements were detected by PCR and Southern blot. The diagnosis of APRCA was based on the absence of erythroid progenitors, with intact granulo- and thrombopoiesis. A pathologic diagnosis of T-LGL leukemia was established by the presence of clonal TCR gene rearrangements and an immunophenotypically distinct CD8 positive T-cell population as previously described. The diagnostic flow cytometric features included abnormal patterns of T-cell antigen expression and aberrant co-expression of NK-cell antigens. Immunoperoxidase features supportive of a diagnosis of LGL were the presence of interstitial clusters or intravascular staining of cells positive for CD8 and TIA-1 and/or granzyme B. Results: We identified 28 patients with APRCA and the presence of clonal TCR gene rearrangements seen at Mayo Clinic Rochester between 7/1/1991 to 6/1/03. All patients presented with a transfusion dependent anemia (median hemoglobin 7.8 g/dL, range 3.6\u201310.3). Tissue was available for immunohistochemical studies for 21 cases. 13 of 21 patients (61%) had an immunophenotypically abnormal T-cell population which, in conjunction with the clonal TCR gene rearrangements were considered diagnostic of T-LGL. 8 patients (39%) had no pathological evidence of T-LGLL despite clonal TCR gene rearrangement studies. The most commonly used treatment consisted of oral cyclophosphamide which was used in 14 of 21 patients (8 and 6 in patients with and without pathological evidence of T-LGLL respectively). A normalization of hemoglobin was seen in 11 patients (6 and 5 in patients with and without evidence of T-LGLL respectively). Median duration of response was 30 months (range 22\u2013120). None of 8 patients with APRCA and clonal TCR gene rearrangements without evidence of LGLL at the the time of initial diagnosis developed overt T-LGLL during follow up (median 64 months, range 30\u2013118). Discussion: 39 % of patients with APRCA and evidence of clonal TCR gene rearrangements did not meet pathological criteria for diagnosis of T-LGLL. There was no apparent difference in disease presentation and response to therapy in patients with or without pathological evidence of LGLL. The significance of the presence of clonal TCR gene rearrangements in the absence of a detectable immunophenotypically abnormal T-cell population is unclear. It is possible that T-LGL was present which could not be detected by our analyses. Alternatively, the clonal TCR gene rearrangements could be indicative of a pertubation of the T-cell compartment related to an autoimmune disorder causing the APRCA. The fact that none of the patients developed progression to overt LGLL supports the latter possibility.",
