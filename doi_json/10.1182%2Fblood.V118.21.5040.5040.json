Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar, Ca\u0301diz, Spain Introduction: Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells often occurring in elderly patients. In the new WHO classification, CMML has been reclassified as a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease. CMML has been subdivided in two subclasses: CMML-1:<5% blasts in peripheral blood and 5\u20139% blasts in bone marrow, and CMML-2: <10% blasts in peripheral blood and 10\u201319% blasts in bone marrow (Greco et al. Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis.2011). Azacitidine (AZA) is an hypomethylating agent approved in Europe for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, with an intermediate to high risk of progressing to AML or death; chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and AML that has developed from a myelodysplastic syndrome (prescribing information EMEA 2011). Until its approval in May 2009, AZA was used in Spain under compassionate use in clinical trials. AZA produce a direct decrease of DNA methyltransferase activity, reverting aberrant DNA methylation and increasing the expression of silenced genes, leading to celular differentiation and/or apoptosis (Greco et al. Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2011). Materials and Methods: We report the results of a retrospective, longitudinal, multicenter Spanish study of 27 patients to assess the effectiveness of AZA to treat CMML. We present results of: Response, Overall Response, Overall Survival and Progression Free Survival. Results: Eighteen of the patients (69.23%) had Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) type 1 and nine (30.77%) CMML type 2. Median age at diagnosis was 69 years. Male/female ratio: 19/8. ECOG performance status score 1\u20132 was 78%, twenty patients (74%) received an initial dose of 75 mg/m2 of AZA, whereas three patients (11%) received 50mg/ m2. The mean number of cycles received was 8.32, 95%IC (5.91; 10.73). Overall response to treatment was 53% (CR+PR+HI+mCR): 14.81% complete response, 7.4% partial response, 3,7% Medular complete response and 29,62% Hematological Improvement. In addition, 18,51% had stable disease. Thirty-six percent of patients were alive at the end of treatment with AZA. Median Overall Survival and Progression Free Survival were 17.47 months (95%CI 9.33, upper limit not reached) and 10.97 (95%IC 3.97, 17.47) respectively ( Figure 1 , 2 ).

More data from this study and further investigation with different clinical trials are needed to confirm these outcomes as well as safety and effectiveness of this treatment.
