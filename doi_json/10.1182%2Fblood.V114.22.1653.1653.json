    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1653 Poster Board I-679 Background The immune system is involved in AML control and Natural Killer (NK) cells are among the most promising effectors. The therapeutic potential of NK cells has been revealed by the Killer Immunoglobulin Receptor (KIR) mismatch allogeneic transplant model where the anti-leukemic effect of the graft, is due to unleashed NK cells towards AML blasts, as suggested by enhanced in vitro lytic activity of KIR-HLA mismatched donor NK cells against recipient blasts (Miller et al. 2005; Ruggeri et al. 2002). Receptors involved in the function of NK cells against AML blasts have been identified (Pende et al., 2005). Some of these receptors are altered in AML patients at diagnosis and might be involved in the immune escape of AML blasts (Costello et al., 2002). However, the status of NK cells during early stages of patient's chemotherapy (CT) treatment is unknown. The present study monitored status of NK cells during early stages following patient's remission after CT that may be critical for their long lasting clinical response, and results might provide new targets for immunotherapy. Methods We enrolled 20 elderly patients (60 to 80 years old) with non promyelocytic AML in first CR following induction and pre-consolidation CT with normal renal and hepatic functions. Patient peripheral NK, gd T and CD8 T cells were analyzed before consolidation CT and every other week after treatment for 8 weeks. 6-colors flow cytometry was performed to investigate the expression of MHC receptors (CD158a, b, e, i, CD85j and NKG2A), activating receptors (NKp30, NKp46, NKG2D, CD16, DNAM-1, 2B4) as well as their differentiation status (perforin and granzyme expression). Their function, as determined by cytotoxicity (51Cr release and CD107 expression) and cytokine production (intracellular staining of IFN-g), was analyzed using purified NK cells stimulated by K562, or in redirected assays using NKp30, NKp46 and CD16 mAbs. Results NK cell counts were depressed away from the induction and pre-consolidation CT as compared to NK cell counts of age-matched controls (ctl) (95\u00b1107 NK/\u03bcL vs 229\u00b191 NK/\u03bcL respectively); they were further depressed during the first 2 weeks post-consolidation CT (55\u00b157 NK/\u03bcL), but were back to pre-consolidation CT level at 4 weeks (105\u00b1102 NK/\u03bcL). In contrast, CD8 T cells and gd T cells counts were normal even at early times post-CT. Expression of 2B4 was depressed at all time points. In contrast, NKp30 expression was lower at diagnosis and close to ctl level post-consolidation CT (p=0.0003) and NKp46 expression increased after CT (p<0.0001). Sizes of NK cell subsets expressing CD158a or CD158b in patients post-induction and consolidation CT were smaller than those of ctl (% CD158a+: p=0.003; % CD158b+: p=0.014). In contrast the NKG2A or CD85j positive NK cell subsets were either unchanged or slightly increased respectively at all time points (p=0.0015 for CD85j+). Moreover, sizes of perforin or granzyme positive NK cell subsets were increased in treated AML patients (% Granzyme+: p= 0.0125 and % Perforin+: p=0.0268). In addition, we observed an important heterogeneity in the expression of the surface receptors among patients that is currently analyzed with respect to the duration of the CR. Finally, NK cell cytoxicity was comparable at all time points to the one of age-matched ctl. In contrast, IFN-g secretion was decreased, at all time points, against K562 or in redirected assays using CD16 mAb and almost abolished using redirected assay with NKp30 mAb. Conclusions This study demonstrates that in elderly AML patients in CR after CT (1) several alterations are detected at all time points, (2) NK cell number is lower and (3) IFN-g secretion is impaired. However NK cytotoxic function is comparable to age-matched controls. The likely basis of the complex pattern of modifications might rely on an interplay between the direct and indirect effects of chemotherapy, activation of immune system, NK cell differentiation and its interaction with AML blasts. Altogether this study indicates that new immunotherapeutic approaches might be used to increase NK cell numbers and functions (cytotoxicity and IFN-g secretion) at early times post-CT in elderly patients with AML.
