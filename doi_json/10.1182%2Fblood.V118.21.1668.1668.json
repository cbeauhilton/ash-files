    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1668 The bcr-abl fusion oncogene causes chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in human. Growth arrest DNA damage 45a (Gadd45a) gene, a member in the gadd45 family of genes including Gadd45b & Gadd45g, is upregulated during myeloid lineage terminal differentiation. It is involved in G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to multiple stressors, including genotoxic and oncogenic stress. To investigate the effect of GADD45A in the development of CML, syngeneic wild type lethally irradiated mice were reconstituted with either wild type or gadd45a null myeloid progenitors transduced with a retrovirally expressed 210-kD BCR-ABL fusion oncoprotein. It was observed that loss of gadd45a accelerates BCR-ABL driven CML resulting in the development of a more aggressive AML like disease. BCR-ABL transformed GADD45A deficient progenitors exhibit increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis, associated with enhanced PI3K-AKT-mTOR-4E-BP1 signaling and upregulation of p30C/EBP\u03b1 and MCL-1 expression. Since Gadd45a functions as a tumor suppressor in murine BCR-Abl driven leukemia, the status of Gadd45a mRNA expression levels was also investigated in human CML samples by utilizing real time PCR analysis. It was found that Gadd45a transcript levels were significantly upregulated in chronic phase CML samples. However in accelerated and blast phase samples, expression was significantly downregulated relative to normal controls. Thus, Gadd45a expression was observed to be altered in human CML samples correlating with disease progression. These results provide novel evidence that gadd45a functions as a suppressor of BCR/ABL driven myeloid leukemogenesis. These data also provide the impetus to further elucidate the role Gadd45a plays in suppressing the development of CML, and explore how its loss contributes to the progression of CML to a more aggressive leukemic phenotype.
