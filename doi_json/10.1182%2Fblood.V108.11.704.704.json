    "abstract_text": "Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAITP) is a life-threatening bleeding disorder which results from maternal anti-platelet antibodies that cross the placenta and destroy fetal platelets. In most cases FNAITP is mediated by anti-\u03b23 integrin antibodies, whereas reported cases of anti-GPIb\u03b1 mediated FNAITP are rare. This difference can not be solely explained by the frequency of their respective polymorphisms. It is unclear whether this is due to: the GPIb\u03b1 antigen being less immunogenic, resulting in less maternal antibody generation during pregnancy, or anti-GPIb\u03b1 antibodies mediating a less severe pathology, resulting in a reduced number of reported cases. To study the immunogenecity and antibody response to the GPIb\u03b1 antigen, GPIb\u03b1 deficient mice (GPIb\u03b1\u2212/\u2212, Black Swiss background) were transfused with wild-type (WT) platelets. No detectable anti-GPIb\u03b1 IgG antibody was induced even after 8 transfusions (10 8 platelets/transfusion). This clearly differs from the immune response generated in \u03b23 integrin deficient (\u03b23\u2212/\u2212, BALB/c background) mice, in which anti-\u03b23 integrin antibody can be easily detected after 2\u20134 WT platelet transfusions. This suggested that the MHC complex in Black Swiss mice might not be able to present the GPIb\u03b1 antigen. We thus introduced the BALB/c background to the GPIb\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice via backcrossing these mice with BALB/c mice for 9 generations (F9). To further minimize genetic background differences, the F9 BALB/c GPIb\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice were bred with F9 BALB/c \u03b23\u2212/\u2212 mice to generate heterozygous BALB/c GPIb\u03b1+/\u2212 and \u03b23+/\u2212 mice. These mice were subsequently used to generate littermate GPIb\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 or \u03b23\u2212/\u2212 mice for the following studies. We found that BALB/c GPIb\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice are immunoresponsive to the GPIb\u03b1 antigen, but antibody titers after 2 and 4 platelet transfusions were significantly lower than those seen with the anti-\u03b23 integrin model (1:50 & 1:200 vs 1:400 & 1:3200 respectively, P<0.05). We then established a FNAITP model with these GPIb\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice and compared it with syngeneic background \u03b23\u2212/\u2212 mice. Nai\u0308ve (Group I) or 2-time-platelet-immunized (Group II) female GPIb\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 or \u03b23\u2212/\u2212 mice were bred with WT male mice. In Group I, neonatal platelet counts after the first delivery were normal and no maternal antibody was detected for both groups. After the third delivery, GPIb\u03b1+/\u2212 pups did not have any bleeding disorders and the maternal antibody was also negative. In contrast, 14.3% of \u03b23+/\u2212 pups were stillborn or had subcutaneous bleeding and maternal antibody was detected. In Group II, 8 pups were delivered from a GPIb\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 female and 2 of them have minor intestinal and subcutaneous bleeding. 10 pups were delivered from 2 \u03b23\u2212/\u2212 female mice and 6 of them were stillborn. Of these dead pups, there was 1 case of intracranial hemorrhage and 2 immature pups. When the anti-GPIb\u03b1 antibody level was increased via 4 platelet transfusions, a GPIb\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 female had a miscarriage and severe FNAITP was observed. Our preliminary data suggested that fewer FNAITP cases reported with alloantibodies against GPIb\u03b1 might not be due to the severity of FNAITP caused by this antibody, but is more likely because GPIb\u03b1 is less immunogenic with a limited repertoire of MHC in pregnant women.",
