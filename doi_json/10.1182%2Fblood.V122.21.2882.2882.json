    "abstract_text": "Backgrounds B cell receptor (BCR) signals and microenvironment protection have been recognized to have key influences on CLL survival and activation. Akt activation is down-stream of the BCR signaling cascade and is critical in the mediation of the bi-directional interactions between CLL B-cells and bone marrow stroma. MK2206 is an allosteric Akt inhibitor previously tested for safety in solid tumor patients. Our preclinical data has demonstrated the synergy of MK2206 with bendamustine (B) to induce CLL apoptosis in vitro . MK2206 also abolished the signal activation and cytokine production induced by BCR ligation in CLL leukemic cells (Ding, ASH 2012). Therefore, we conducted a phase 1 trial testing the safety and efficacy of MK2206 in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) for patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Methods A phase 1 dose-escalation study was designed to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as well as the safety and efficacy of 3 dose levels (90 mg or 135 mg or 200 mg weekly) of the oral Akt inhibitor MK2206 in combination with bendamustine (70 mg/m 2 daily for 2 days in each cycle) and rituximab (cycle 1: 375 mg/m 2 , cycle 2-6: 500 mg/m 2 ) therapy in relapse/refractory CLL patients. To test the targeting efficacy of MK2206 on Akt and downstream signals, we designed a one-week \u201crun-in\u201d of single agent MK2206 before the initiation of BR during cycle 1. MK2206 was then given along with BR on day 1 of cycles 2-6. Tumor response was evaluated 2 months after the 6 th /last cycle of therapy based on IWCLL 2008 criteria. Correlative laboratory studies included assessment of Akt signaling and the plasma cytokine levels (multiplex beads assay (Invitrogen)) at baseline and after one week of first dose of single agent MK2206. Results Nine patients (median age 68) were enrolled in the phase I portion of this trial. All 9 patients had unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes (IGHV) and 4 had del(11q). Six had received prior chemoimmunotherapy (CIT: FCR or PCR or PCO) and 5 had high risk disease defined as early progression within 26 months of the last CIT. Three had received alemtuzumab containing regimen. We have observed potent lymphocyte mobilization in all evaluated patients (n=7) after one-dose of MK2206 during week 1 (mean increase ALC: 35%) as well as reductions of plasma CCL3, CCL4 and CCL2 in the majority of the patients. A single dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) (febrile neutropenia and hemolytic anemia) was observed at dose level 1 (90 mg weekly) among 6 patients treated at this dose. Two patients with dose-limiting toxicities at dose level 2 (135 mg weekly) were observed where one patient had a rash and one patient had dehydration and febrile neutropenia among three patients treated at this dose. Accordingly, the 90 mg once weekly dose was determined to be the MTD for phase 2 trial testing. The most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events observed to date were neutropenia (44%) including febrile neutropenia (22%), rash (22%), diarrhea (22%), nausea and vomiting (11%), dehydration (11%), hemolytic anemia (11%) and thrombocytopenia (11%). The frequency of cytopenias was similar to the published German experience with BR (50% grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicities compared to 44% in N1087) in relapsed CLL patients (Fischer, JCO 2011). The median number of cycles received was 6 (range 1-6). Using an intent to treat analysis, two patients achieved complete response (CR, n= 2, 22%), one patient achieved nodular partial response (nPR, n=1, 11%) and five patients achieved a partial response (PR, n=5, 56%). The overall response rate (ORR) is 89%. Conclusion The Akt inhibitor MK2206 in combination with BR is well tolerated in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Single dose of MK2206 inhibits Akt phosphorylation, mobilizes leukemic cells and decreases plasma cytokines involved in BCR signals. The preliminary efficacy of this combination demonstrated promising results with a 89% ORR and 22% CR albeit in the small phase 1 cohort. These results compare favorably to BR alone (9% CR and 59% ORR) in relapsed/refractory CLL patients. Phase 2 testing of this combination is now underway.
