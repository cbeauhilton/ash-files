    "abstract_text": "Polycyhemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by increased thromboxane (TX) production and thrombotic risk. It is reported that serum TXB2 concentrations in PV patients are twofold higher than healthy controls and that low-dose aspirin (ASA) therapy reduces the risk of major vascular events by 50 to 60%. To evaluate this unusual size of the effect of ASA we have studied platelet count, hematocrit (HCT), \u03b2-thromboglobulin (\u03b2-TG) and platelet factor 4 (PF4), as markers of platelet activation, TXB2, as primary indicator of platelet activation, the platelet function activity (PFA), as indicator of ASA platelet sensitivity, and the clotting time (CT), as parameter of thrombin formation. We studied 60 patients (38 men, 22 women; mean age 51 years, range 32-70) with PV according to WHO criteria. The mean duration of disease was 12 years. All patients were on ASA 100 mg once daily. All patients were on phlebotomy. None had inherited or acquired thrombotic risk factors. Of 60 patients, 30 had thrombosis (20 men, 10 women) and 30 had no thrombosis. Of 30 with thrombosis, 15 developed nonfatal myocardial infarction (10 men, 5 women) defined by chest pain of typical intensity and duration and ST-segment elevation in any limb lead on electrocardiography, 10 had nonfatal stroke (8 men, 2 women) confirmed with the use of magnetic resonance imaging, and 5 (2 men , 3 women) had deep venous thrombosis confirmed by ultrasonography. Platelet count and HCT were measured by automated analyzer. \u03b2-TG and PF4 were determined by ELISA. TXB2 was measured by radioimmunoassay technique. ASA platelet sensitivity was measured by Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA-100). CT was measured by thromboelastometry. The mean platelet count was 430\u00b1170x109/L. The mean HCT value was 42\u00b13%. The patients with thrombosis had high \u03b2-TG, PF4 and TXB2 (110\u00b145 IU/ml, 45\u00b121 IU/ml, and 1.700\u00b11.990 nmol/L, respectively), shortened C/EPI closure time (T, unit: s, n.v. 84-160 s) (55\u00b110 s) and shortened CT (CT, unit: s. n.v. 100-240 s) (45\u00b120 s) whereas the patients without thrombosis had normal \u03b2-TG, PF4 and TXB2 (20\u00b111 IU/ml, 6\u00b12 IU/ml, and 800\u00b1280 nmpl/L, respectively), prolonged C/EPI closure time (249\u00b140 s) and normal CT (110\u00b120 s). These findings might suggest that in PV patients and thrombotic complications might need a platelet-selective dosage of ASA. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
