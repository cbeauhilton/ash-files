    "abstract_text": "Mutations in the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha ( CEBPA ) are detected in about 10% of patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). CEBPA mutation can either affect both CEBPA alleles (biallelic, bi CEBPA ) or only one allele (monoallelic, moCEBPA). We and others have shown that only patients with bi CEBPA mutations have favorable outcomes when compared to other CN-AML patients (Dufour et al , JCO 2009; Green et al , JCO, 2010). Interestingly, bi CEBPA mutations are rarely associated with other known prognostic mutations (e.g. FLT3 -ITD, NPM1 ). In this study we aimed to characterize the mutational spectrum of CN-AML patients with mo- and bi CEBPA mutations using a targeted amplicon sequencing approach. We analyzed 45 bi CEBPA patients and 35 mo CEBPA patients. 55 of these patients (26 bi CEBPA and 29 mo CEBPA ) were enrolled in a multicenter trial of the German AML Cooperative Group (AMLCG-1999). Our amplicon resequencing panel included 42 genes which are known to be frequently mutated in AML (Haloplex, target region 62 kilobases). Out of these 42 genes we identified 23 different mutated genes in the bi CEBPA subgroup and a total of 28 different mutated genes in the mo CEBPA cohort. The mean number of mutated genes per mo CEBPA patient was significantly larger (4.37\u00b11.6) than in bi CEBPA patients (2.96\u00b11.22) (P<0.05). The two groups also differed remarkably with regard to the genes that were mutated. In the mo CEBPA group FLT3 (46%), NPM1 (46%), TET2 (37%) and DNMT3A (26%) were the most frequently mutated genes, whereas the bi CEBPA group showed frequent mutations in TET2 (40%), GATA2 (36%) and FLT3 (18%). Thus there was a strong association of NPM1 (P<0.0001), FLT3 (P=0.01) and IDH2 (P=0.04) mutations with the mo CEBPA group. GATA2 mutations were significantly associated with bi CEBPA mutations (P=0.0003). NPM1 and bi CEBPA mutations were mutually exclusive. In this large and well characterized CEBPA -mutated patient cohort we identified distinct mutational landscapes in patients with mo CEBPA and bi CEBPA mutated CN-AML. The lower number of mutated genes within the bi CEBPA group suggests that biallelic CEBPA mutations may act as a strong driver. In almost all cases, patients with biallelic mutations of CEBPA have a C-terminal mutation in one allele of CEBPA and an N-terminal mutation in the other allele. These date provide further insight into the genetic background of CEBPA mutated CN-AML. We are currently analyzing the prognostic impact of the associated mutations.
