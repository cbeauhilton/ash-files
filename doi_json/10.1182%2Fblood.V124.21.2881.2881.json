    "abstract_text": "Ex vivo-generated (EV) platelets beginning with embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) or hematopoietic progenitors cells (HPCs) may have clinical utility over donor-derived platelets, and efforts to produce such EV-platelets have been pursued in several laboratories under static megakaryocyte (Meg) culture conditions. Success in generating these has been reported, even demonstrating EV-platelet incorporation into growing thrombi in murine models. We have pursued an alternative strategy for thrombopoiesis using EV-Megs, grown from either human adult HPCs or from iPSCs or fetal livers, and directly infusing them into NOD-SCID gamma-interferon-deficient (NSG) mice. These studies were based on our prior observation that infused murine EV-Megs into wildtype mice are entrapped in the pulmonary bed and over the subsequent 1-4 hours release a wave of functional platelets at a significant level. We now show that infusion of human EV-Megs do the same in NSG mice, but resulting in two different pools of derived platelets: (1) A pool of young (as determined by thiazole orange staining) platelets having the same bell-shaped size distribution was seen as after infusion of human donor-derived platelets in these mice. These platelets take several hours to appear, but then have the same half-life as donor-derived platelets. These platelets are derived from the infused EV-Megs and were termed in vivo-generated (IV)-platelets. (2) A second pool of mostly older platelets was present that originated during the static growth of the EV-Megs, and these EV-platelets varied widely in size and age. Initially, these platelets accounted for a third of all the human platelets seen. Unlike IV-platelets, EV-platelets are immediately present and circulate with a markedly short half-life of 2-3 hours unless the recipient NSG mice were pre-treated with clodronate-ladened liposomes to delete their macrophage pools. Rapid removal of EV-platelets by macrophages is due to their being preactivated as determined by surface P-selectin expression in whole mice blood. These EV-platelets also had very limited further responsiveness to convulxin activation. On the other hand, human IV-platelets were quiescent prior to agonist stimulation in whole mice blood and responded strongly to agonist, similar to human donor-derived platelets infused into NSG mice. The IV-platelets were also selectively incorporated into cremaster arteriole laser injury thrombi over EV-platelets. Finally, directly harvested \u201cplatelets\u201d from EV static-grown Megs were isolated and analyzed both in vitro and in vivo. Only a third of these particles are CD41 + /CD42 + platelets and approximately half are actually CD41 - /CD42 - . Both pools showed the same wide size distribution in vitro and in vivo after infusion into mice. The CD41 + /CD42 + fraction behaved just as the EV-platelets, but the CD41 - /CD42 - fraction half-life was unaffected by pre-treatment with clodronate-ladened liposomes. In summary, infused human Megs grown under static growth conditions released platelets in a recipient mouse\u2019s lung with features characteristic of donor-derived platelets. On the other hand, \u201cplatelets\u201d harvested from the same Megs were predominantly not even platelets as measured using CD41/CD42 markers. The portion that were CD41 + /CD42 + platelets were preactivated, poorly responsive to agonists, and cleared rapidly. These findings set a standard on how to judge the potential clinical value of platelets derived from EV-Megs and also raise concerns whether direct visual imaging of \u201cplatelet release\u201d in static culture is biologically meaningful given that most particles released were not CD41 + /CD42 + platelets, and the ones that were CD41 + /CD42 + were mis-sized and functionally limited.
