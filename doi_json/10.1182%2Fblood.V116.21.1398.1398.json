    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1398 Acquired Haemophilia (AH) is an autoimmune disorder, characterized by autoantibodies against the coagulant activity of Factor VIII: C. Is a rare (estimated frequency 1.5 cases per million/year), but severe hemorrhagic condition. EACH2 is a multinational European registry from 90 centres in 11 countries that recruited between 2003\u20132009, This abstract describes the demographic, clinical and aetiological data recorded in a web database from EACH2 from the largest cohort described in the literature to date. Outcomes of haemostatic therapy, immunosuppression and during pregnancy are described elsewhere. Data were recorded on consecutive patients from each centre. Informed consent was taken as appropriate to each country. Parametric and non-parametric test, were used to analyse the study. There were 501 AH patients included in the registry. The basic demographic data are shown in Table 1 . Table 1: Demographic data of the whole group expressed in median, interquartile range (IQR) and range  . Age . FVIII at diagnosis IU/dL .

Idiopathic remains the more frequent aetiological association. Bleeding is the principal clinical manifestation but in a proportion of patients there is a considerable delay in diagnosis. The finding of an abnormal APTT in a bleeding patient with no history of hemorrhagic condition should raise suspicion of AH. Survival in this patient cohort is clearly related to response to immunosuppressive therapy. Disclosures: Marco: Novo Nordisk: Consultancy.
