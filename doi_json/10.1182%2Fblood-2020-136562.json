    "abstract_text": "Background Megakaryopoiesis and platelets production intensely depend on bone marrow(BM) microenvironment. Our previous studies found that impaired BM microenvironment and dysfunctional megakaryopoiesis are responsible for the occurrence of prolonged isolated thrombocytopenia (PT), which is defined as the engraftment of all peripheral blood cell lines other than a platelet count less than 20\u00d710 9 /L or a dependence on platelet transfusions for more than 60 days following allo-HSCT( BBMT 2014; BBMT 2017; Brit J Haematol 2018; Am J Hematol 2018). As an important component of the BM microenvironment, macrophages (M\u0553s) are heterogeneous and polarized into classically activated (M1) M\u0553s and alternatively activated (M2) M\u0553s with distinct phenotypes and function. Although inconsistent effect of BM M\u0553s was reported on megakaryopoiesis, the functional role of M1 and M2 M\u0553s and related pathway in regulating megakaryopoiesis and its effect on PT patients post-allotransplant remain to be elucidated. Aims To address the roles of M1 M\u0424s and M2 M\u0424s in regulating megakaryopoiesis as well as PI3K-AKT pathway in the process. Moreover, polarization status and the function of BM M\u0424s in regulating megakaryopoiesis were evaluated in PT patients. Methods This prospective nested case-control study enrolled 12 patients with PT, 24 matched patients with good graft function (GGF), defined as persistent successful engraftment after allotransplant, and 12 healthy donors (HD). BM standard monocyte subsets and M1/M2 M\u0553s polarization state were analyzed by flow cytometry. To generate M1 and M2 M\u0553s, both primary BM M\u0553s and THP1 cell lines were treated with LPS and IFN-\u03b3 or with IL-4 and IL-13. The functions of BM M\u0553s were evaluated by migration, phagocytosis and cytokine secretion assay. The sorted CD34+ cells from HD were co-cultured with BM M\u0553s from PT and GGF patients or M1 and M2 M\u0553s respectively for megakaryopoiesis. The quantification of the megakaryocytes(MKs), MKs apoptosis, MKs polyploidy distribution, colony-forming unit MK(CFU-MK) efficiency, and platelet production were analyzed in the coculture system. To understand the underlying mechanism of M\u0553s polarization in regulating MKs, RNA-seq analyses were performed in BM M\u0553s from PT and GGF patients. In addition, M1 and M2 M\u0553s were treated with the chemical inhibitors and lentivirus for PI3K-AKT pathway. Results Elevated intermediate and non-classical monocyte subsets were found in PT patients when compared with those in GGF patients. Moreover, PT patients displayed increased M1 and reduced M2 M\u0553s, resulting an unbalanced M1/M2 polarization, compared with GGF and HD. BM M\u0553s from PT patients, with high TNF-\u03b1 levels and low TGF-\u03b2 levels, showed decreased megakaryopoiesis-supporting ability. No significant differences in migration and phagocytosis function of M\u0553s among the three groups. RNA sequencing of BM M\u0553s showed down-regulated PI3K-AKT pathway in M\u0553s of PT patients compared with GGF. Consistently, the phosphorylation levels of AKT decreased significantly in M\u0553s of PT patients, suggesting that PI3K-AKT pathway may functionally regulate megakaryopoiesis-supporting ability of M\u0553s. Subsequently, BM-M2 and THP1-M2 showed superior effect on megakaryopoiesis-supporting ability compared with BM-M1 and THP1-M1. Specifically, the BM CD34+ cells cocultured with M2 M\u0553s demonstrated significant increased percentages of MKs and MK polyploidy, CFU-MK efficiency, and platelet count compared with those cocultured with M1 M\u0553s. Preventing PI3K-AKT pathway by PI3K inhibitor or Akt inhibitor significantly reduced the megakaryopoiesis-supporting ability of M2 M\u0553s. Moreover, knockdown of AKT1 induced the impairment of megakaryopoiesis-supporting ability via suppressing M2 M\u0553s polarization, which could be attenuated by AKT1 overexpression complementarily. Summary/Conclusion The current study demonstrated the polarization status of M\u0553s modulates their ability to support megakaryopoiesis. M2 M\u0553s, but not M1 M\u0553s, support megakaryopoiesis via up-regulating PI3K-AKT pathway. Defective M2 M\u0553s polarization via down-regulating PI3K-AKT pathway may be responsible for the pathogenesis of PT post-allotransplant, which provides a promising therapeutic target for PT patients.
