    "abstract_text": "Abstract 453 Background: Imatinib (IM) 400 mg daily is the standard treatment for Ph+ Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) in early Chronic Phase (ECP). Nilotinib (NIL) is a 2 nd generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with superior efficacy to IM (phase 3 ENESTnd trial). NIL has been approved for the frontline treatment of CML in many countries. The treatment with more than one TKI, according to the principles of cancer polychemotherapy, may improve the response rates and may decrease the frequency of drug-resistance. The combination of different TKIs is potentially toxic, difficult to be explored in the ECP setting. The sequential administration of IM and NIL is worth to be investigated because a significant proportion of CML patients treated with a single TKI as monotherapy develops primary or secondary resistance. Aims: To evaluate the response (either cytogenetic and molecular) and the outcome of ECP Ph+ CML patients treated with the sequential administration of NIL and IM. Methods: A phase 2 study was conducted by the GIMEMA CML WP (ClinicalTrials.gov. NCT00769327 ). NIL was administered first because it has a more rapid therapeutic effect. Schedule: NIL 400 mg twice daily for 3 months; IM 400 mg daily for the next 3 months; then, NIL and IM turning every 3 months, for a total duration of 24 months (study core). The 3-month rotation schedule was respected, irrespectively of temporary discontinuations. The primary end-point was the Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCgR) rate at 12 months. If the conventional cytogenetic analysis resulted not evaluable, a FISH analysis was performed. If one of the 2 drugs was permanently discontinued for adverse event (AE), the patient remained in study, continuing the treatment with the other drug (except for cardiac AEs). Definitions: Major Molecular Response (MMR): BCR-ABL/ABL ratio < 0,1% IS ; failure: according to 2009 ELN recommendations; event: failure, permanent discontinuation of both drug for any reason, patient refusal. All the analysis were performed according to the ITT principle. Results: 123 patients have been enrolled in 38 italian hematologic Centers; median age 56 years (range 18\u201384); 33% low, 45% intermediate and 22% high Sokal score; median follow-up 21 months (at least 12 months observation, 24 months by November 2011). The cumulative CCgR rate by 12 months was 87%; CCgR at each milestone: 68% at 3 months, 73% at 6 months, 67% at 12 months (primary efficacy variable). The cumulative MMR rate by 12 months was 82%, while the rates of MMR at 3, 6 and 12 months were 59%, 62% and 60%, respectively. The discrepancies between cumulative response rates and response at each timepoint were mainly due to the number of patients not evaluable at each timepoint (10% of cytogenetic analysis not evaluable at 12 months) and to protocol discontinuation in stable CCgR and/or MMR. The incidence of hematologic AEs was low. Non-hematologic AEs or lab abnormalities grade > 2 observed in >5 % of patients were as follows: NIL - skin rash, pruritus, bilirubin increase, transaminase increase, lipase increase; IM - fluid retention, periorbital edema. AEs were manageable with appropriate dose adaptations. Four patients (3%) showed a prolongation of the QTcF above 450 msec (none above 500 msec). At the end of the first 12 months, 95 patients (77%) remained on study: 6 and 3 on NIL and IM monotherapy, respectively, 86 on sequential treatment with both drugs; 15% of patients permanently reduced the NIL dose to 400 mg daily and 9% of patients permanently reduced the IM dose to 300 mg daily. During the first year, 28 patients (23%) experienced an event: 10 treatment failure (8%); 2 death in CP (2%); 16 refusal, protocol violation or AE (13%). Six out of the 10 patients who failed the treatment progressed to advanced phase (3 patients: detection of a T315I mutation). Conclusions: The cumulative response rates achieved with a sequential administration of NIL and IM seem to be superior to the historical data of IM alone. The response rates at each timepoint, lower than expected, were probably due to the high number of not evaluable patients and to the number of patients not continuing the study despite a stable CCgR/MMR. However, if compared to the excellent results of 2 nd generation TKI as monotherapy in ECP CML (single and randomized trials), the present analysis do not support an alternating schedule of NIL and IM as frontline treatment of ECP CML.
