    "abstract_text": "Abstract 788 FLT3 mutations are common in AML and are associated with poor prognosis. Lestaurtinib is a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor with potent activity against FLT3. In an attempt to definitively establish whether or not there is clinical benefit for FLT3 inhibition in the relapse setting, we conducted a randomized trial of chemotherapy followed by lestaurtinib for patients with FLT3 mutant AML in first relapse. Patients were randomized to receive either chemotherapy alone, consisting of mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine (MEC) or high-dose cytarabine (HiDAc) depending on the duration of CR1) or chemotherapy followed by 80 mg lestaurtinib orally BID. Patients on the chemotherapy only arm were eligible for crossover if they were refractory to therapy. Patients on the lestaurtinib arm received the drug for up to 112 days on study (they could continue to receive the drug through a separate extension protocol). The primary objective was complete remission (CR/CRp). Secondary objectives included overall survival (OS), safety, and tolerability. From January 2004 through December 2008, 224 patients at 52 different centers were enrolled and randomized, with 220 patients actually receiving therapy. Blood samples from patients on the lestaurtinib arm were obtained at baseline, on Day 15, and on Day 42 for pK studies and for determination of in vivo FLT3 inhibition and measurement of plasma FLT3 ligand (FL) and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) levels. The median age for all patients enrolled was 55 years (53.5 in the control arm, 58.5 in the lestaurtinib arm), with 88% having FLT3/ITD mutations, 8% having D835 mutations, and 4% having both. The duration of CR1 was less than 6 months in 47% of patients in each arm. On the lestaurtinib arm, 107 patients received at least 1 week of lestaurtinib (mean 60.1 days, range 8-418), with 17 of these patients receiving drug on the extension protocol. On the chemotherapy only arm, 7 patients crossed over to receive lestaurtinib, and 31 patients went on to receive lestaurtinib on the extension protocol after outcome evaluation. Lestaurtinib was generally well tolerated following chemotherapy, with 104 Grade 3/4 adverse events in the lestaurtinib arm versus 99 in the control arm. There were 61 serious adverse events in the lestaurtinib arm versus 49 in the control arm. Early death (by Day 42) occurred in 22 lestaurtinib patients (2 progressive leukemia, 14 infectious, 6 organ failure) and16 control patients (6 progressive leukemia, 5 infectious, 5 organ failure). By intention to treat analysis, there were 29 CR/CRp in the lestaurtinib arm and 23 in the control arm (26% versus 21%; p = 0.35), with no difference in OS (4.73 months versus 4.57 months) between the two arms. Blood samples from 79 of the 107 lestaurtinib-treated patients obtained on Day 15 were analyzed for FLT3 inhibitory activity (plasma inhibitory activity [PIA] assay), as well as FLT3 ligand (FL), lestaurtinib, and AGP concentrations. Mean lestaurtinib plasma concentration was 12 uM at Day 15 and fell to 7.5 uM on Day 42. Mean lestaurtinib concentration at Day 15 was 13.3 uM in patients achieving CR/CRp and 11.5uM in non-responders. A target of >85% inhibition of FLT3 maintained at trough (pre-dose) was defined from previous studies. Of the 79 patients tested, 46 (58%) achieved this degree of FLT3 inhibition on Day 15. FL concentrations rose from baseline (15.6 pg/mL) to Day 15 (1148 pg/mL), and AGP concentrations rose by an average of 52% over the same period, both of which may have reduced the degree of FLT3 inhibition. Of the 46 patients with target FLT3 inhibition on Day 15, 18 (39%) achieved CR/CRp, while only 3 (9%) of the 32 patients with below target FLT3 inhibition achieved CR/CRp. Thus, in patients with FLT3 mutant AML at first relapse, pharmacokinetic factors and possible physiologic factors (FL and AGP) limit lestaurtinib's ability to effectively inhibit FLT3. FLT3 inhibition by lestaurtinib, when achieved, correlates with better CR rates, but in this trial that benefit was negated by a poor CR rate in those patients for whom the drug did not reach the target level of FLT3 inhibition. Overall, lestaurtinib treatment following re-induction chemotherapy failed to increase response rates or prolong survival of patients with FLT3 mutant AML in first relapse.
