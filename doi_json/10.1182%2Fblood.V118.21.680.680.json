    "abstract_text": "Abstract 680 Scat (severe combined anemia and thrombocytopenia) is a spontaneous, autosomal recessive mutation coisogenic with the BALB/cBy inbred mouse strain. Homozygous scat mice present a cyclic phenotype with alternating episodes of crisis and remission. As its name implies, crisis episodes are characterized by severe anemia and thrombocytopenia, but significant lymphocyte depletion occurs as well. The first crisis episode begins in utero , lasts until postnatal day (P) 9 on average, and is associated with 10\u201315% mortality. Remarkably, in homozygotes that survive the first crisis, a remission phase occurs wherein the disease phenotype reverts to normal. This remission is transient, however, and is followed by a second crisis episode during which 94% of scat/scat mice die by P30. Previously we showed that the scat phenotype is transferrable via the hematopoietic stem cells and is also recapitulated in scat/scat , Hox11\u2212/\u2212 double homozygotes in which a spleen does not develop, indicating that the splenic micro-environment plays little or no role in disease appearance or progression. Positional cloning of scat revealed a missense mutation in Rasa3 encoding a GTPase activating protein (GAP) that negatively regulates Ras function by accelerating GTP hydrolysis and converting Ras to the inactive GDP bound form. We further showed that Rasa3 is a conserved gene critical to vertebrate erythropoiesis via morpholino knockdowns in zebrafish which resulted in profound anemia. Here we report data that shed further light on RASA3 function during hematopoiesis. Overall, the data indicate that defects in RASA3 profoundly and negatively impact erythropoiesis and megakaryocytopoieis through, at least in part, a Ras-mediated mechanism. FACS analyses of scat spleen and bone marrow erythroid populations reveal a severe block in erythropoiesis during crisis periods. In the spleen, despite an initial increase in size due to expansion of Ter-119 + cells, there is ultimately a loss of compensatory erythropoiesis resulting in a return to normal cellularity and a striking loss of hemoglobinized cells as the crisis phenotype deepens. In addition, the bone marrow shows loss of Ter-119 + cells and overall cell depletion during crisis. Megakaryocyte numbers are increased in scat crisis BM and spleen. By transmission electron microscopy, scat crisis megakaryocytes display features characteristic of a significant developmental delay: a disorganized demarcation membrane system with no platelet forming areas and few granules with hypersegmented nuclei and excess rough endoplasmic reticulum. In addition to the severe anemia and thrombocytopenia, a significant lymphopenia occurs in scat crisis mice. However, the scat phenotype is not lymphocyte mediated, as the scat phenotype is completely recapitulated in mice doubly homozygous for scat and the immunodeficient mutations, scid and Rag1 tm1Mom , in which B- and T-lymphocytes are completely depleted. Together these results suggest that lymphopenia is a secondary phenomenon in scat , and the severe anemia and thrombocytopenia aspect of the phenotype neither follows from nor is dependent upon loss of lymphocytes. Despite the delay observed in erythroid differentiation, some mature red cells are produced although \u223c50% of these are reticulocytes. By confocal microscopy, we show that RASA3 protein localizes to the plasma membrane as well as internal membrane compartments in wild type reticulocytes, where it partially colocalizes with CD71. Western blot analyses of reticulocytes after Percoll gradient purification show that RASA3 is lost during the maturation step, both in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, in scat , RASA3 is present in reticulocytes, but appears to be mislocalized, the protein being found in the cytosol. Preparation of ghosts from wild type and scat reticulocytes confirms that RASA3 is not attached to the membrane in scat animals during crisis. In pull-down assays active GTP-bound Ras is increased in scat crisis reticulocytes when compared to wild type, suggesting that scat is a RASA3 loss of function mutation due to its mislocalization and demonstrating a critical role for the RASA3-Ras axis during mammalian erythropoiesis.
