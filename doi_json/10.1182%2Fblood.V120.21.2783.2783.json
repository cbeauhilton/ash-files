    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2783 Although the prognosis of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has improved significantly with the advent and use of novel BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in recent years, still a number of patients fail to achieve a durable molecular remission or they relapse. It is of particular importance to define the prognosis in individual patients as early as possible, as timely intervention with novel TKI may improve long term outcome. Basophilia is one of the most predictive and best documented biomarkers in CML at diagnosis. However, in high risk patients, the basophil-committed compartment of the clone may exceed the morphologically identifyable fraction of mature granulated basophils detected in MGG or Giemsa stains. In addition, even granulated basophils may be immature cells and may therefore escape microscopic examination. Tryptase is a serine protease primarily expressed by mast cells but also by immature basophils. In healthy controls, the serum tryptase level ranges between 15 ng/mL), 31% showed a progression, whereas in the cohort with normal tryptase (\u226415 ng/ml), 9% of the patients were found to progress (p<0.05). Of all peripheral blood parameters analyzed, including white blood cell counts, platelets, eosinophils, basophils, and peripheral blast cells, only basophils and tryptase were found to be significant prognostic variables in univariate analysis. As assessed by multivariate analysis performed with the same paramters as above except basophils, tryptase was found to be an independent prognostic variable. Since basophilia is a key variable used in the recently established EUTOS score, we asked whether basophils can be replaced by serum tryptase levels. Indeed, with regard to PFS, this novel EUTOS-T score was found to be of prognostic significance. In particular, the EUTOS-T score was found to predict the PFS of our patients with high confidence and a p-value of 0.004 compared to a p-value of 0.019 in the original EUTOS score. In addition, the EUTOS-T score was found to be a superior score for predicting event-free survival compared. Together, these data suggest that the serum tryptase level is a useful prognostic biomarker in CML. Moreover, the substitution of basophils by tryptase in established scoring systems may improve the predictive value of these scores. Disclosures: Sperr: Phadia: Research Funding.
