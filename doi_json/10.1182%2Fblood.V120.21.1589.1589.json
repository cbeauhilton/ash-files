    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1589 Introduction: Acquired potentially N-glycosylation sites are produced by somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the immunoglobulin (Ig) variable region. This phenomenon is produced in \u223c9% of normal B-cells and seems to be related to certain B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (B-LPDs) such as follicular lymphoma (FL, 79%), endemic Burkitt lymphoma (BL, 82%) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, 41%). These data suggest that new potential N-glycosylation sites could be related to germinal center B (GCB)-LPDs. By contrast, in other B-LPDs, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), MALT lymphoma, Waldenstro\u0308m macroglobulinemia (WM) or multiple myeloma (MM), these modifications have not been analyzed in deep. Aims: To evaluate the acquisition of potential N-glycosylation sites in B-LPDs, including immunohystochemical DLBCL subtypes (GCB and non-GCB) and specific non-GCB-LPDs, such as hairy cell leukemia (HCL), splenic marginal-zone lymphoma (SMZL), CLL, MCL, ocular extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (OAEMZL), MM and WM. Patients: A total of 953 sequences (203 from our group and 750 previously published sequences) of B-LPDs were included. Diagnosis distribution was as follows: DLBCL (n=235), MCL (n=235), CLL (n=166), MM (n=96), OAEMZL (n=82), SMZL (n=68), WM (n=38) and HCL (n=33). Methods: Acquired N-glycosylation sites were counted according to the sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr, where X could be any amino acid except Pro. Natural motifs in germline sequences of IGHV1\u201308, IGHV4\u201334 e IGHV-5a were not considered. Fisher test was used to perform comparisons between groups. To distinguish DLBCL biological subtypes (GCB and non-GCB DLBCL), Hans' algorithm was used. Results: A total of 83 out of the 235 DLBCL cases acquired at least a new N-glycosylation site, a higher value than in normal B-cells (35% vs. 9%, p<0.0001). Higher incidence of these motifs in the group of GCB as compared to non-GCB DLBCL were observed (52% vs. 20%, p<0.0001). Those cases diagnosed of HCL, CLL, MCL, MM, WM, OAEMZL and SMZL presented a reduced number of new N-glycosylation sites, showing similar values than normal B-cells (range 3\u201318%, p=ns). Conclusions: We described for the first time the pattern of N-glycosylation in HCL, SMZL, OAEMZL and in the immunohystochemical DLBCL subtypes, where the GCB-DLBCL showed a higher number of new N-glycosylation sites with respect to non-GCB DLBCL and other non-GCB-LPDs. The presence of novel N-glycosylation sites in FL, BL and in GCB-DLBCL strongly suggests that these motifs are characteristic of the germinal center B-LPDs.
