    "abstract_text": "Except in MD Anderson Center, seric \u03b22-m is not recognized as a strong prognostic factor in CLL and seric LDH too, despite this factor is more and more important among lymphoma with a continuous prognostic value. So we studied 248 CLL aged less than 75 yrs, without elevated creatininemia or evident hemolysis. There were 201 pts with stage A, 29 B and 18 C and sex-ratio M/F was 1.48. Median survival time is 10 yrs and median \u201ccorrected\u201d (i.e., without not CLL-related deaths including those due to a solid tumor because this complication is independent of initial prognostic factors of CLL) survival time is 10.9 yrs. LDH values range from 0.55 to 3.54 N, and mean and median values are 1.05\u00b10.40 and 0.96 N. LDH level is only correlated with blood lymphocytosis and hemoglobin levels studied as continuous values (p=0.015 and 0.002). When looking at \u201ccorrected\u201d survival, all cut-off values from 0.75 N, N, 1.25 N\u2026 to 2.5 N are statistically significant but the best one is 1.25 N (p=6 10 \u22126 ). \u03b22-m values range from 0.81 to 16.5 mg per l, and mean and median values are 2.67\u00b11.75 and 2.15 mg. When studied as continuous values, \u03b22-m is linked to age, number of lymphoid areas according to Binet\u2019s system, and hemoglobin and platelets levels (p=0.0009, <10 \u22124 , <10 \u22124 and 0.003) but age was ruled out among patients less than 70 yrs. For \u201ccorrected\u201d survival, all cut-off values except 1.25 mg were significant and for example p value at 4 mg level as usually used by MD Anderson Center, is 5 10 \u22125 . However we find that the best cut-off value is 3 mg (p<10 \u22126 ) and this value is statistically independent from LDH one in Cox model. We tried to combine these 2 cut-off values. Product of observed LDH/1.25 N \u00d7 observed \u03b22-m/3 mg were pertinent to isolate pts with a very poor prognosis (median \u201ccorrected\u201d survival time about 6 yrs) but size of pejorative subgroups were small ( \u2248 25% of all pts) and other subgroups were not statistically significant. When adding ratios, results were similar. So we find that the best system is to count the number of pejoratives factors, i.e., LDH > 1.25 N and \u03b22-m > 3 mg. Global median survival times of the 3 defined groups were respectively > 10.8 yrs (160 pts), 6.5 yrs (68 pts) and 4.2 yrs (20 pts) with a p value < 10 \u22126 . This system is also efficient among stage A pts (p=10 \u22125 ). When we compare this prognostic system with Binet\u2019s and Rai\u2019s prognostic systems, Cox model rules out Binet\u2019s one and keeps Rai\u2019s system and ours (p=0.01 and 0.0005). Among patients with stage A, Cox model keeps only this LDH and \u03b22-m system. We conclude on the strong prognostic values of seric LDH and \u03b22-m initial levels in CLL and we claim that these 2 simple biological parameters have to been compared with \u201cmodern\u201d biological prognostic factors of CLL."
