    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) represents a potentially curative treatment for recurrent lymphoid malignancies. In fact, potential advantages include the use of a tumor free graft and immune-mediated graft-versus-lymphoma effect. Here, we analyzed the impact of pre-transplantation factors on outcome in 141 lymphoma patients (pts) receiving RIC and allogeneic SCT from HLA-identical sibling donors. Histologic types included in the study were: low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (LG-NHL; n=58), high-grade NHL (HG-NHL, n=55), Hodgkin disease (HD; n= 28). Median age was 50 years (range: 20\u201369). The three groups (HD vs LG-NHL vs HG-NHL) had similar characteristics in terms of: chemosensitive disease (57% vs 69% vs 67%, p=ns) and complete remission (CR) at transplant (18% vs 27% vs 34%, p=ns). Pts with HD had received more lines of chemotherapy (>2 vs \u22642) as compared to LG-NHL and HG-NHL (82% vs 52% vs 42%). Furthermore, the proportion of pts receving previous autologous SCT was significantly higher in HD and HG-NHL versus LG-NHL (75% vs 54% vs 27%). In addition, patients with HG-NHL and HD underwent frequently allo-SCT less than 2 years after diagnosis as compared to LG-NHL (58% vs 39% vs 24%). All patients received debulkying chemotherapy followed by the same RIC containing thiotepa (10 mg/kg), fludarabine (60 mg/ms) and cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg). GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A and short-course methotrexate. At a median follow-up of 30 months (8\u201370), the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 65% (95%CI, 56\u201374%) and 57% (95%CI, 47%\u201367%), respectively. Univariate analysis showed that age (< or > 55 years), donor sex, interval between diagnosis and SCT, number of previous treatments did not influence outcome whereas diagnosis of HD was associated with a significant inferior PFS and OS. Chemosensitive disease (CR+PR) influenced PFS in HG-NHL (p<0.0003) and HD (p<0.0036) but not in LG-NHL (p=0.69). Complete remission at transplant was associated to a significant better PFS in HD (p<0.01) but not in HG-NHL (p= 0.14) and LG-NHL (p=0.7). Previous autologous SCT was associated to inferior PFS (64% vs 50%, p<0.04) but did not affected OS and TRM. By multivariate analysis, diagnosis of HD and refractory disease were associated to an inferior PFS (p<0.0001, p<0.001) whereas diagnosis of HD and no-CR at transplant remained of prognostic value on OS (p<0.006 and p<0.007). We conclude: 1) age and previous treatments, including autologous SCT, are no longer limitations for allogeneic SCT; 2) debulking therapy before RIC allogeneic SCT is required for HD and HG-NHL; 3) new strategies for an early indentification of chemorefractory pts are necessary.",
