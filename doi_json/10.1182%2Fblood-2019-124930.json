    "abstract_text": "Background: Progress in genome technology allows analysis of previously completed trials to identify subgroups potentially benefiting from therapy. Enzastaurin is a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C beta (PKC-\u03b2) and suppresses the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. The safety and efficacy of Enzastaurin has been tested in more than 60 clinical trials including 2 major studies in DLBCL: (1) PRELUDE (A phase III maintenance trial of Enzastaurin vs Placebo, N=758) (Crump, 2016), and (2) S028 (A randomized phase II study of Enzastaurin/R-CHOP vs R-CHOP in frontline intermediate/high-risk DLBCL, N=101) (Hainsworth, 2016). DNA samples extracted from blood of patients from PRELUDE were retrospectively genotyped using whole genome SNP arrays. From the genome wide screening a novel genetic biomarker, DGM1, was identified showing high correlation with response to Enzastaurin treatment (Luo, ASH 2018). Importantly, these findings were replicated in the phase II S028 study. In the S028 study the hazard ratio (HR) for OS in high-risk (IPI \u2265 3) DGM1 positive (+) patients who received Enzastaurin/R-CHOP was 0.28 (0.1-0.81) when compared to subjects who received R-CHOP, a benefit favoring Enzastaurin (p=0.018). These data suggest that addition of Enzastaurin to R-CHOP may significantly improve outcome in frontline high-risk DGM1 (+) DLBCL. The ENGINE study was initiated to validate this finding in a prospective study. Study Design and Methods: Adult patients must have untreated CD20+ DLBCL, IPI \u2265 3. Patients are randomized 1:1 to Enzastaurin/R-CHOP or Placebo/R-CHOP for 6 cycles during combination phase. Each subject's treatment assignment will be unblinded after response assessment at the end of the combination phase. Subjects randomized to the investigational arm who have a complete or partial response will have the option to continue in the single agent phase to receive Enzastaurin for up to 2 additional years. The study intends to enroll approximately 235 patients with primary endpoint of OS in DGM1 (+) patients. The study is ongoing with 57 sites open in the US and China. As of 20 July 2019, 128 patients have been randomized. Clinical trial information: NCT03263026.
