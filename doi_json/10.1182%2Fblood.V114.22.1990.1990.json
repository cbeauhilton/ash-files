    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1990 Poster Board I-1012 Erythrocyte dematin is a widely expressed actin-binding and bundling protein, and functions as a suppressor of RhoA signaling in fibroblasts (Mohseni and Chishti, Molecular Cell Biology 28: 4712-4718, 2008). Dematin is a substrate of multiple protein kinases, and its actin bundling activity is regulated by cAMP dependent protein kinase. Recently, we identified a novel interaction between dematin and glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) that is critically important for erythrocyte shape and membrane mechanical properties (Khan et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry 283:14600-14609, 2008). Since homologues of dematin and GLUT1 exist in many non-erythroid cells, we proposed that a conserved mechanism might couple related sugar transporters, such as the insulin-responsive glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4), to the actin cytoskeleton via dematin. Immunocytochemistry established the presence of dematin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and a small pool of dematin and GLUT4-containing vesicles co-localized in 3T3-L1 cells under both basal and insulin-stimulated conditions. Plasma membrane sheet assays indicate that upon insulin stimulation, dematin translocates to the plasma membrane along with GLUT4, resulting in partial co-localization at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, dematin RNAi treated 3T3-L1 cells show reduced GLUT4 protein expression, suggesting that dematin may regulate a sub-population of GLUT4 via the lysosomal degradation pathway in adipocytes. Importantly, glucose transport was reduced by \u223c28% in 3T3-L1 adipocytes depleted of dematin, and by \u223c15% in the dematin headpiece knockout (HPKO) mouse primary adipocytes. Since a significant amount of dematin did not co-localize with GLUT4 in the cytosol and plasma membrane, biochemical interaction between dematin and GLUT4 could not be verified using immunoprecipitation and transfection assays. Although dematin does not bind directly to GLUT4 under these conditions, a possibility existed that this interaction may be transient and mediated through an adaptor protein. Interestingly, dematin contains seven 14-3-3 binding sites, and 14-3-3 adaptor has been shown to be functionally involved in GLUT4 trafficking. We demonstrate that phosphorylated dematin binds to 14-3-3 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes under both basal and insulin stimulated conditions. Mutagenesis studies identify serine-85 on dematin as the primary phospho-binding site for 14-3-3zeta. Furthermore, using pharmacological inhibitors, Akt is identified as the likely protein kinase that phosphorylates dematin to mediate the biochemical interactions between dematin and 14-3-3zeta. Together, our results identify erythrocyte dematin as a potential regulator of glucose transporter trafficking and degradation pathways in adipocytes with functional implications for glucose homeostasis, diabetes, and obesity.
