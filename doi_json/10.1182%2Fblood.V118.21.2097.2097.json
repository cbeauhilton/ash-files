    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2097 Anemia of inflammation (AI) has been widely associated with chronic rheumatologic, infectious, and cardiovascular disorders and comprises one-third of cases of anemia in the elderly. Although the antimicrobial peptide hepcidin is felt to be the prime regulator of AI, emerging evidence supports the premise that subsets of AI may be mediated via hepcidin-independent inflammatory pathways, such as those modulated by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), that directly suppress erythropoiesis. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of anemia subtypes is necessary if we are to develop more effective targeted, oral therapies for patients with inflammatory anemia. Our recent analysis of elderly participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) revealed that vitamin D deficiency was strongly associated with AI in this population, with this subgroup exhibiting a rate of vitamin D deficiency nearly twice that of similarly aged non-anemic individuals. In the current study we aimed to evaluate whether vitamin D treatment may ameliorate TNF\u03b1-mediated erythroid colony suppression in humans. Human bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells from 3 healthy adults were first cultured in methylcellulose medium containing IL-3 (10ng/ml), EPO (1U/ml), SCF (50ng/ml) in the presence or absence of TNF\u03b1 (25 ng/ml) and increasing doses of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [calcitriol, (0.01-1nM)], and erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) measured on day 14. The percentage of BFU-E colonies was reduced by 50% at day 14 in the presence of 25ng/ml TNF\u03b1 (p < 0.01, t-test). TNF\u03b1-mediated suppression of erythropoiesis was reversed by the addition of vitamin D 3 in a dose-dependent manner, with 1nM vitamin D 3 resulting in a 50% recovery of BFU-E colony numbers at day 14 (p < 0.05, t-test). Vitamin D 3 alone exhibited no significant effect on BFU-E formation at all concentrations tested. Based on studies showing that vitamin D receptor may serve as a negative regulator of NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity, we next investigated whether vitamin D 3 may alter TNF\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB activation in both K562 and human CD34+ cells. K562 cells pre-incubated with 1nM vitamin D 3 for 3, 24, 48 and 72 hours were treated with 5 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 for 30 minutes, and NF-\u03baB activity in nuclear fraction was determined by an ELISA-format oligonucleotide binding assay. TNF\u03b1 treatment alone markedly increased the oligonucleotide binding activity of the NF-\u03baB p65 subunit, which was completely blocked by co-incubation with competitor oligonucleotide, confirming the assay specificity. Pre-incubation with vitamin D 3 for 3 \u2013 48 hours showed little effect on TNF\u03b1-mediated NF-\u03baB activation, but pre-incubation for 72 hours resulted in suppression of TNF\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB activity by 46% (p < 0.02, t-test). Under similar conditions, human CD34+ cells pre-incubated with 1 nM vitamin D 3 for 48 hours and 72 hours exhibited 38% and 84% suppression of TNF\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB activity, respectively (p < 0.01 for both conditions, t-test). Reduced NF-\u03baB activity was correlated with the decreased nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB in K562 cells with no significant changes in I\u03baB degradation, suggesting that vitamin D 3 regulates the NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation independent of I\u03baB. Western analysis of whole cell lysates from both K562 and human CD34+ cells using antibodies recognizing known TNF\u03b1-associated signaling pathways revealed robust increases in phospho-p38, phospho-JNK, and phospho-ERK1/2 in response to TNF\u03b1 stimulation compared with control, with no inhibition of these signaling pathways noted in response to vitamin D 3 treatment at all doses tested, suggesting that vitamin D 3 does not inhibit these TNF\u03b1-induced signaling cascades. Our study indicates that 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 significantly ameliorates TNF\u03b1-mediated suppression of erythroid colony development in human CD34+ cells via mechanisms that involve modulation of NF-\u03baB signaling pathways and supports the design of future clinical trials examining whether vitamin D 3 supplementation may prove to be an effective therapy for subgroups of patients with TNF\u03b1-mediated inflammatory anemia.
