    "abstract_text": "Introduction:. Myocardial iron can now be rapidly and reproducibly assessed using a validated cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) T2* technique. However, the calibration of T2* value to absolute myocardial iron concentration is currently unknown in humans. Purpose: To calibrate myocardial T2* values in post-mortem hearts. Methods: Two patients\u2019 hearts have been examined. Each was scanned at 37 Celsius using optimised T2* MR sequences. Iron assays were performed with 100 samples per heart, from 5 short axis slices of the left ventricle. For each slice, 6 segments were cut and a sample taken from the endocardium, mid-wall and epicardium, and 2 from the right ventricular free wall (20 samples per slice). This trial was supported by NIH grant R01 DK66084-01. Results: Heart 1 from Genova Italy, was from a patient with beta-thalassemia major who had been transfused from age 2 to his death at age 47 from a stroke. The patient had heart failure aged 21 years, from which he had recovered. At age 46, the patient had bradycardia and arrhythmia, and his long-term deferoxamine treatment was augmented with deferiprone for 6 months, and then switched to deferiprone alone at 69mg/kg/day for 7 days per week, starting 1 year prior to death. Ex vivo mid-ventricle full thickness septum T2* was 45ms. Heart 2 from London was from a transfusion dependent patient with sideroblastic anemia with poor compliance with deferoxamine. The patient died in heart failure. Further clinical details are awaited. Pre-mortem mid-ventricle septum T2* was 5.2ms, and the T2* value in the same region post-mortem was identical at 5.2ms. The results of the ex-vivo comparison of segmental myocardial T2* and matching segmental absolute iron level are shown in figure 1. Calibration is shown on a log-log scale in accord with previous liver sample evidence showing this allows fitting with a linear function ( Anderson LJ. Eur Heart J  2001 ; 22 : 2171.9 ). Conclusion: These are the first human data calibrating human myocardial T2* against absolute iron levels. Myocardial T2* clearly decreases as myocardial iron increases. Of interest was the identical myocardial T2* result between the in-vivo and post-mortem scans in patient 2. Further hearts are now needed to complete the calibration and to determine the consistency of calibration between hearts. View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure ",
