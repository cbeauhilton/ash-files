    "abstract_text": "Azacitidine, a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine, causes hypomethilation of DNA. Currently FDA approved for treatment of low and intermediate MDS with complete responses around 50%. And Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the eldery In the CALGB studies, the usual dose is 75mg/m2 in 28 day cycles, with dose modifications according to toxicity. In low income countries such as Mexico, one course of Azacitidine is around 500 dollars, median income in Mexico is 4,910 PPP (purchasing power parity); vs 30,616 in the USA. So, azacitidine treatment is far from reach for most of the common population, particularly those who do not have insurance. This is a retrospective observational study, of a compassionate use program of a fixed dose of Aza at 100mg. We analyzed data from patients that were treated with Aza between 2012 and 2016, and collected data in 2016. The aim of the study was to assess the effectivity of the fixed dose. For that purpose, we collected information from the physical and electronic file. We analyzed: Hemoglobin level before and after treatment, independence of transfusion, ANC recovery, number of courses, and overall survival. We conducted our research in a public institution in Mexico (Instituto Nacional de Cancerolog\u00eda) and a private institution (Medica Sur). We included acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, regardless of age, previous treatment and comorbidities (we included patients with renal failure, hypertension etc.) We included 8 patients in our study, 6 males and 2 females, with a mean age of 69.9 years (49-87). We had 2 AML and 6 MDS. We had 2 high risk AML and according to IPSS-R: 1 very low, 2 low, 1 intermediate, 1 high and 1 very high risk MDS. As for the Karyotype we had 1 complex KT, 4 normal KT and 1 Del 7q Del 5q +8. All patients received at least one dose of Aza, with mean number of cycles of 4. We have a mean survival of 439 days (110-1385). 6/8 patients achieved transfusion independency within 3 doses of Aza. 6/8 patients achieved ANC but lost eventually lost response. 5/8 patients are alive in follow up. 3 patients died of infectious complications. 2 patients never achieved transfusion independence or ANC. The information recovered suggests that a fixed dose of 100mg is as feasible as a higher dose, at least when no other treatment or higher dose can be administered. We still are analyzing the survival data in order to find other bad prognosis factor within this population.
