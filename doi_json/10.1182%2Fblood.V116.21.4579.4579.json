    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4579 Objective: In this study, we explored the efficiency and toxicity of 38 cases of double-unit umbilical cord blood transplantation (CBT) in adults with hematologic disease. Methods: The tolerance; transplant related complications; survival rate and disease free survival rate were observed and analyzed. A nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen included cyclophosphamide, fludarabine and 2Gy TBI. Cyclosporine combined mycophenolate mofetil and ATG were used to prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD). Results: All these 38 patients tolerated the therapy well while two patients had graft failure. Severe acute GVHD was presented in 6 patients. Chronic GVHD was occurred in 16 patients. Fatal infection complications were occurred in 5 patients (including CMV idiopathic pneumonia in 2 patients) and 4 patients relapsed after transplantation. Neutrophil engraftment obtained on day +17 and platelet reconstitution occurred on day +42 on median. In the follow-up duration of 17 months on median, the expected 2-year relapse mortality was 17.95%; non-relapse mortality was 25.90%; overall survival was 60.80%, and disease free survival was 52.11%. Compare with 39 cases of haplo-identical HSCT in our department, significant delays in engraftment and lower severe GVHD occurred after CBT. There was no apparent difference between the risk of relapse and DFS in both groups. Conclusion: The use of double-unit CBT after reduced intensive conditioning therapy in adults with hematologic disease is an effective and safe treatment. Fatal infection and relapse are the main reasons of failure. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
