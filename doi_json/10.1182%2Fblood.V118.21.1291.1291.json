    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1291 Alcam , which encodes the activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (CD166), is a cell surface immunoglobulin superfamily member mediating homophilic adhesion as well as heterotypic interactions with CD6. It has recently been shown that Alcam+ endosteal subset in the bone marrow contain hematopoietic niche cells able to support hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) activity. We examined Alcam mRNA levels and cell surface expression by quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry in various hematopoietic stem and progenitor subsets. We found that Alcam is highly expressed in long-term repopulating HSC (LT-HSC), multipotent progenitors (MPP), and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP). We use an Alcam null mouse allele to assess the function of Alcam in HSC differentiation and self-renewal. Clonogenic colony-forming progenitor serial-replating assay show that the replating potential of Alcam-deficient LT-HSCs is impaired. An in vitro single-cell differentiation assay of phenotypic LT-HSCs reveals that Alcam-deficiency leads to an enhanced granulocytic differentiation. In competitive repopulation transplantation, Alcam-deficient cells show a transient engraftment enhancement, however, the engraftment is significantly lower in secondary transplantation, suggesting that the self-renewal capacity of Alcam-deficient HSC is compromised. We performed a limiting-dilution transplantation assay and determined that the frequency of long-term repopulating cells in Alcam-deficient bone marrow is significantly reduced compared to wild type control. We further assessed the engraftment efficiency of phenotypically purified LT-HSCs. We show that the engraftment efficiency of Alcam-deleted LT-HSCs is significantly reduced compared to wild type LT-HSCs. Since Alcam-deleted HSCs are able to home efficiently to the bone marrow cavity, the engraftment defect is not due to inefficient homing upon transplantation. Collectively, These studies implicate Alcam mediated cell-cell interaction in the regulation of hematopoietic transplantation and recovery. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
