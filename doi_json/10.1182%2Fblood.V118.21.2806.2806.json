    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2806 Background: A high degree of prognostic certainty is required to recommend or discourage high risk treatment procedures in primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS-plus) uses eight risk factors to predict overall survival (OS) in PMF: unfavorable karyotype, peripheral blood (PB) blast count \u22651%, platelet count <100 \u00d7 10 9 /L, white blood cell count (WBC) >25 \u00d7 10 9 /L, hemoglobin level 65 years ( Gangat et al. JCO 2011;29 :392 ). The presence of four or more of these risk factors defines high-risk disease. purpose: The purpose of the current study was to enhance the prognostic weight of some of the DIPSS-plus risk factors with the intent to identify one or two parameters that can reliably predict death in the first two years of disease. Methods: An updated Mayo Clinic database of 884 karyotypically-annotated patients with PMF was used. Calculations of 2-year mortality rates and variables considered for prognostic value were from time of referral to the Mayo Clinic. Cytogenetic risk categorization per DIPSS-plus was further refined to capture additional prognostic information from monosomal karyotype (MK) ( Vaidya et al. Blood 2011;117 :5612) and inv(3)/i(17q) abnormalities ( Caramazza et al. Leukemia 2011;25 :82) . Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was employed to define best discriminant levels. Results: To date, 564 (64%) deaths have been documented. Each one of the aforementioned DIPSS-plus risk factors was associated with a 2-year mortality rate that ranged from 42% (PB blast count \u22651%) to 60% (unfavorable karyotype). High-risk disease per DIPSS-plus was associated with 57% two-year mortality. The only risk factors that were associated with >80% two-year mortality were MK ( n =19) and inv(3)/i(17q) abnormalities ( n =8) and both were associated with significantly worse survival, compared to other unfavorable karyotype ( n =102): HR (95% CI) of 5.1 (3.1\u22128.4) and 3.9 (1.7\u22128.8), respectively. ROC analysis identified PB blast counts of 2% and 9% (AUC 0.62) and WBC of 43 \u00d7 10 9 /L (AUC 0.66) as best discriminant levels for predicting 2-year mortality; OS was significantly worse in the presence of PB blast >9% (HR 4.1, 95% CI 2.8\u20136.1) vs. 2% to 9% (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.5\u20132.2) vs. <2%; the corresponding 2-year mortality rates were 73%, 46% and 25%. OS was also significantly worse in the presence of WBC \u226540 \u00d7 10 9 /L (HR 2.8, 95% CI 2.2\u20133.6) vs. 26\u201339 \u00d7 10 9 /L (HR 1.6, 95% CI, 1.2\u20132.1) vs. <26 \u00d7 10 9 /L; the corresponding 2-year mortality rates were 63%, 42% and 28%. Two-year mortality rates exceeded 80% in the presence of any two of the following: PB blast count >9%, WBC \u226540 \u00d7 10 9 /L or unfavorable karyotype other than MK or inv(3)/i(17q). Conclusions: A greater than 80% 2-year mortality in PMF is predicted by the presence of MK, inv(3)/i(17q) abnormalities, or any two of the following: PB blast >9%, WBC \u226540 \u00d7 10 9 /L, other unfavorable karyotype. Such patients and those with high DIPSS-plus risk should be referred to allogenic stem cell transplantation earlier than later. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
