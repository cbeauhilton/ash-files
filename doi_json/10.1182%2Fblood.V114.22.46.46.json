    "abstract_text": "Abstract 46 The broader application of haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-HCT), is limited by the delayed immune reconstitution (IR) secondary to the procedures for GvHD prophylaxis. This ultimately results in a high-rate of infectious complications and non-relapse mortality. We dynamically analyzed immunoreconstitution (IR) in patients undergoing haplo-HCT for acute leukemias enrolled in two different phase I-II clinical trials aimed at improving IR. In the first trial (TK007), 28 patients (out of 50 enrolled) received suicide-gene transduced donor T cells at day +42 after a T-cell depleted graft, in the absence of post-transplant immunosuppression. In the second trial (TrRaMM), 40 patients received an unmanipulated graft and a rapamycin-based GvHD prophylaxis. T-cell immune reconstitution was more rapid in TrRaMM than in TK007 patients, with a threshold of CD3 cells>100/\u03bcl reached at days +30 and +90, respectively. In both trials IR was mainly composed of Th1/Tc1 lymphocytes with an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio. While in TrRaMM patients we observed an early expansion of nai\u0308ve and central memory T cells, producing high amounts of IL-2, in TK patients IR was mainly composed of activated effectors. Furthermore, in TrRaMM patients we detected high levels of CD4+CD25+CD127- T regulatory cells (up to 15% of circulating T lymphocytes) that persisted after rapamycin withdrawal, and was significantly superior to that observed in TK patients and in healthy controls. Interestingly, in contrast to the different kinetics of T-cell reconstitution, no differences were observed in time required to gain protective levels of CMV-specific T cells, as shown by \u03c8IFN ELISPOT analysis. Protective frequencies of CMV-specific lymphocytes were observed 3 months after HCT in both groups, a time-point that in TrRaMM patients corresponds to the average time of rapamycin withdrawal. In both trials the number of circulating CMV-specific T cells was inversely correlated to the number and severity of subsequent CMV reactivations and days of antiviral therapy. GvHD was diagnosed in 16 TrRaMM patients (40%) and in 10 TK patients (35% of patients who received TK cells). Severity of GvHD was different in the two cohort of patients with 5 TrRaMM patients (12,5%) and only 2 TK patients (7%) with grade III-IV GvHD. Of interest, in the TrRaMM group CMV-specific immunity was significantly hampered by the immunosuppressive treatment required to treat GvHD. On the contrary, in the TK group, the administration of ganciclovir was able to activate the suicide machinery and control GvHD without impairing viral-specific T-cell immunocompetence. These results matched with the kinetics of CMV reactivations. We observed that while in TrRaMM patients 80% of viral reactivations occurred after the immunosuppressive therapy, in TK patients no significant differences could be assessed before and after therapy. IFN-\u03c8 ELISPOT might thus be a relevant and predictive test to guide patient-specific clinical monitoring and antiviral treatment. Overall, these results show that early immune reconstitution can be promoted in haplo-HCT by different strategies associated with a wide range of alloreactive potential. The risks and benefits associated with alloreactivity should guide the therapeutic choice tuned on patient disease status and co-morbidities. Disclosures: Bordignon: Molmed Spa: Employment.",
