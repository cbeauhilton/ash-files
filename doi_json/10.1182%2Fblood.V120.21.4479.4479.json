    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4479 Background: In vivo T-cell depletion with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is known to decrease the incidence of acute and chronic graft vs. host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, the detailed patterns of GVHD (incidence, severity, timing, and quality) after ATG-based conditioning have not been examined in large patient cohorts, and it is unknown whether they differ from those seen in patients who do not receive ATG during conditioning therapy. Patients and Methods: We analyzed the incidence and characteristics of acute and chronic GVHD, requirements for immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and survival in a cohort of 174 patients who underwent a first HCT for hematologic malignancy with ATG as a part of their conditioning regimen. The median age was 54 years (range 19\u201376); all but 5 pts received PBSC, and median follow-up of survivors was 16.9 months (range 3\u201370 months). Donors were matched related in 18% (n=32), matched unrelated in 44% (n=77), and mismatched unrelated in 37% (n=65). Conditioning regimens were myeloablative in 33% (n=57) and reduced intensity in 67% (n=117). Additional GVHD prophylaxis included tacrolimus in all patients combined with either methotrexate (42%) or MMF (58%). Results: The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD at 100 days was 34% and 7%, respectively, with the median time of onset at 43 days (range 11\u201398 days) after transplant. Eleven patients (6.3%) required additional immunosuppressive treatment due to steroid refractory GVHD. Late/persistent acute GVHD without any evidence of chronic occurred in 25% of patients. NIH chronic GVHD developed in 25 patients, with a cumulative incidence of 24.4% at 2 years. Forty four percent of these patients were classified as classic chronic, and 56% as overlap. The onset of chronic GVHD was quiescent in 20 (80%), progressive in 3 (12%), and de-novo in 2 (8%) patients. The global severity was mild in 9 (36%), moderate in 11 (44%) and severe in 5 (20%) cases. The median time of onset for chronic GVHD was 185 days (range 99\u2013763). In a multivariate analysis of factors predictive for development of chronic GVHD, the only factor associated with development of chronic GVHD was prior grade II-IV acute GVHD (HR 2.5, p =.03). The most common diagnostic organ was mouth (n=16), followed by skin (n=8) and eye (n=1). The median number of sites involved during the course of chronic GVHD was 4 (range 1\u20137), and the median number of systemic immunosuppressive agents for treatment was 2 (range 0\u20134). Among the 25 chronic GVHD patients, 5 have discontinued immunosuppression at a median time of 13.1 months (range 6\u201326) since the diagnosis of chronic GVHD. The cumulative incidence of discontinuation of IST was 23% at one year and 50% at two years. Three deaths in the overall cohort were attributed to complications related to acute (n=2) or chronic GVHD (n=1). At 2 years, the overall survival among all 174 pts was 62.4%, cumulative incidence of relapse was 23.1%, and non-relapse mortality was 22.7%. Conclusion: These data from a large, uniformly treated and graded, predominantly peripheral blood stem cell transplant recipient population, confirm that ATG decreases both the incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD. In particular, the rate of moderate to severe chronic GVHD is extremely low, resulting in minimal need for tertiary treatment and decreased duration of immunosupression.
