    "abstract_text": "MLL rearrangements play a crucial role in leukemogenesis. They are associated with a poor prognosis and new treatment strategies are urgently needed. Here, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate an innovative leukemia model based on 100% pure MLL-AF4 / -AF9 rearranged cells derived from umbilical cord blood with indefinite growth in cell culture systems. Our model shared phenotypical, morphological and molecular features of patient leukemic cells faithfully mimicking the nature of the disease. Thus, it serves as ideal fundamental basis for pharmacological studies. The catalytic activity of disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like histone methyltransferase (DOT1L) is critical for the transforming potential of MLL oncogenes. Therefore, inhibition of DOT1L deals as one specific therapeutic approach for MLL -rearranged leukemias currently tested in clinical trials. However, the previous success was limited by restricted response warranting further investigation of DOT1L combinations. Recently, it has been shown that the inhibition of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) exhibits anti-tumoral activity against human cell lines in vitro and in MLL mouse models. Here, we used DOT1L (EPZ004777) and PRMT5 (EPZ015666) inhibitors alone or in combination in our human MLL -rearranged model demonstrating a dose-dependent reduced proliferation, impairment of cell cycle, upregulation of differentiation marker CD14 and apoptosis measured by flow cytometry and downregulation of known MLL target genes determined by qPCR. Strikingly, the combination of both compounds led to complementary anti-tumor effects. Our study provides a strong rationale for novel targeted combination therapies to improve the outcome of MLL -rearranged leukemias. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
