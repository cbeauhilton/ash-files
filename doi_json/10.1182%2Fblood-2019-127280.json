    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Standard of care for patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma (R/R cHL) remains salvage chemotherapy with subsequent autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), which leads to long-term remission in about half of pts. Prognosis is poor for pts who relapse or progress after ASCT, particularly among pts who relapse after prior treatment with brentuximab vedotin (BV). Programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors are an effective therapeutic option. Previous analyses of the multicohort phase 2 KEYNOTE-087 (NCT02453594) study showed that PD-1 pathway inhibition with pembrolizumab (pembro) led to effective antitumor activity and acceptable safety in pts with R/R cHL. KEYNOTE-087 results led to FDA approval of pembro for adult and pediatric pts with R/R cHL who relapsed after \u22653 prior lines of therapy. Long-term durability of response is a key clinical question for pts receiving immunotherapy. We present efficacy and safety of patients in KEYNOTE-087 who received 3 y of follow-up and evaluate antitumor activity in pts who were re-treated after disease progression. Methods: Pts with R/R cHL who progressed after ASCT and subsequent BV therapy (cohort 1), underwent salvage chemotherapy and BV and were ineligible for ASCT (cohort 2), or progressed after ASCT but were not treated with BV after ASCT (cohort 3) were enrolled and received pembro 200 mg IV Q3W. Pts who discontinued pembro after initial confirmed CR after \u22656 mo of treatment and then experienced disease progression were eligible to receive an additional \u226417 cycles (~1 y) of pembro (second course). Response was assessed Q12W per 2007 Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphomas. Primary end points were safety and overall response rate (ORR) per blinded independent central review in all pts in each cohort. Secondary end points included complete remission (CR) rate, duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Results : At data cutoff, median follow-up was 39.5 mo (range, 1.0-44.8). In the total population (N=210), 46 pts completed 2 y of treatment, 164 pts discontinued (primary reason, progressive disease [n=86]). ORR was 71.0% (95% CI, 64.3-77.0) with 58 CRs (27.6%) and 91 PRs (43.3%). ORR was 78.3% (CR, n=18; PR, n=36) in cohort 1 (n=69), 64.2% (CR, n=21; PR, n=31) in cohort 2 (n=81), and 71.7% (CR, n=19; PR, n=24) in cohort 3 (n=60). Overall median DOR was 16.6 mo (95% CI, 0.0+ to 39.1+). 45.1% of pts had a response duration \u226524 mo; 26.9% had a response duration \u226536 mo. 19/149 (12.8%) pts had an ongoing response. Median DOR was 25.0 mo in cohort 1, 11.1 mo in cohort 2, and 16.8 mo in cohort 3. In the total population, median PFS was 13.6 mo (95% CI, 11.1-16.7) and the 36-mo PFS rate was 18.8%. Median PFS was 16.4 mo (95% CI, 11.3-27.6) in cohort 1, 11.1 mo (95% CI, 7.3-13.5) in cohort 2, and 19.4 mo (95% CI, 8.4-22.1) in cohort 3. Median OS was not reached in the total population or in the cohorts; 36-mo OS rate was 86.4% in the total population, 86.3% in cohort 1, 85.7% in cohort 2, and 87.6% in cohort 3. 17 pts entered the second-course phase, of whom 16 were evaluable for response (8 in cohort 1, 6 in cohort 2, 2 in cohort 3). 4 pts completed 17 cycles of treatment; 7 pts have ongoing treatment. Second-course ORR was 68.8% with 5 CRs (31.3%) and 6 PRs (37.5%); 4 pts (25.0%) had stable disease. ORR for cohorts 1, 2, and 3 was 75.0% (CR, n=1; PR, n=5), 83.3% (CR, n=4; PR, n=1), and 0.0%, respectively. Both pts in cohort 3 had stable disease; 1 completed 17 cycles of pembro and the other is still receiving treatment. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) of any grade occurred in 72.9% of pts; the most commonly reported were hypothyroidism (14.3%), pyrexia (11.4%), fatigue (11.0%), and rash (11.0%). Grade 3-4 treatment-related AEs occurred in 11.9% of pts; only neutropenia (n=5) and diarrhea (n=2) occurred in \u22652 pts. No grade 5 treatment-related AEs occurred. Conclusions: With a median of 39.5 mo of follow-up, pembro continued to demonstrate clinically important antitumor activity in pts with R/R cHL. In the total population and in pts with different treatment histories, ORRs were high and responses were durable. Second-course pembro was able to re-induce remission in most patients who previously reached CR. Safety was manageable, and no unexpected AEs occurred.
