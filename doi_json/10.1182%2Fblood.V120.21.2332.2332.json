    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2332 MicroRNA-9 (miR-9) is required for normal neurogenesis and organ development. The expression of miR-9 is altered in several types of solid tumors suggesting that it may have a function in cell transformation. However the role of this miR in normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis is unknown. Here we show that miR-9 is expressed at low levels in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSCs/HPCs), and that it is upregulated during hematopoietic differentiation. Ectopic expression of miR-9 strongly accelerates terminal myelopoiesis, while promoting apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the inhibition of miR-9 in HPC with a miRNA sponge blocks myelopoiesis. EVI1, required for normal embryogenesis, and is considered an oncogene because inappropriate upregulation induces malignant transformation in solid and hematopoietic cancers. In vitro, EVI1 severely affects myeloid differentiation. Here we show that EVI1 binds to the promoter of miR-9\u20133 leading to DNA hypermethylation of the promoter as well as repression of miR-9. We also show that ectopic miR-9 reverses the myeloid differentiation block that is induced by EVI1. Our findings suggest that inappropriately expressed EVI1 delays or blocks myeloid differentiation, at least in part by DNA hypermethylation and downregulation of miR-9. It was previously reported that FoxOs genes inhibit myeloid differentiation and prevent differentiation of leukemia initiating cells. Here we identify FoxO3 and FoxO1 as new direct targets of miR-9 in hematopoietic cells, and we find that upregulation of FoxO3 in miR-9-positive cells reduces the acceleration of myelopoiesis. These results reveal a novel role of miR-9 in myelopoiesis and in the pathogenesis of EVI1-induced myeloid neoplasms. They also provide new insights on the potential chromatin-modifying role of oncogenes in epigenetic changes in cancer cells. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
