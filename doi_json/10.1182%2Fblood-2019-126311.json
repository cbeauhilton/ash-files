    "abstract_text": "One strategy to improve precision medicine in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is to further our understanding of the biological factors that influence pharmacologic efficacy. In a recent study, whole transcriptome analysis was conducted using pre- and post-treatment samples from a cohort of relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML patients treated with mitoxantrone, etoposide, cytarabine (MEC), and ixazomib. Logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis identified ROR a as a predictor of response to treatment (Advani, et a l., Clin Cancer Res, 2019, 4231-4237). ROR a is not frequently mutated in AML but is described to be a tumor suppressor in patients with solid tumors. In the latter patient population, increased ROR a expression is also associated with improved survival. We first retrospectively evaluated the prognostic significance of ROR a in a larger cohort of R/R patients with AML (BeatAML). Second, we characterized ROR a expression in cellular models of AML and sought to determine whether a commercially available ROR a /ROR\u03b3 agonist, SR1078, has anti-proliferative capacity in leukemia cell lines. For the correlative survival analyses, ROR a mRNA expression and clinical information was downloaded from the BeatAML cohort (Tyner, et al ., Nature , 2018, 526-531). Patients were categorized into high expressers (\u2265 median) and low expressers (<median). In total, 121 R/R patients were investigated. The mean age of diagnosis was 62 \u00b1 12 years, and 58% of patients were male. The most common specific diagnosis at inclusion was AML with myelodysplasia related changes (28%), followed by AML with mutated NPM1 (18%) and therapy-related myeloid dysplasia (13%). Over half of the analyzed samples were peripheral blood (58%), and the remaining samples were either bone marrow aspirate (58%) or from leukapharesis (2%). As a whole, the median mRNA expression levels of ROR a in patients with R/R AML (n=121) compared to healthy subjects (n=21) were 6.6 log 2 CPM vs. 2.5 log 2 CPM ( P <.0001). After grouping patients into low ROR a expresser and high ROR a expresser groups, patients with above median expression of ROR a were found to have significantly longer overall survival (19 mo. vs. 13 mo.; P =.0052; Figure 1 ). During normal hematopoiesis, we observed that ROR a expression decreased with the stages of cellular maturation and is highly expressed in cells of AML patients with complex karyotype ( BloodSpot , 2018). We noted that ROR a mRNA expression varied across patients suggesting differences between AML subtypes. Expression levels were also confirmed to be different across AML subtypes in vitro by using cell line models (K-562, KG-1, OCI-AML3, U-937, THP-1, MOLM-13). In particular, analysis of TCGA data showed higher mean ROR a expression in DNMT3A mutant (MT) (626 RPKM) compared to mean ROR a expression in CEBPA MT (243 RPKM; P= 0.026 ), NPM1 MT (167 RPKM; P= 0.012 ), and FLT3 MT (236 RPKM; P= .003) AML patients. We then analyzed the sensitivity of cell lines to the commercially available synthetic ROR a / ROR\u03b3 ligand, SR1078. Myeloid lineage cells U-937 and KG-1 were used as a cellular model. Cells in logarithmic phase were treated with increased concentrations of the ROR a / ROR\u03b3 agonist SR1078 (from 3 nM to 30 mM) for 24 hours. Cell viability was measured by MTT tetrazolium reduction assay. Maximal growth inhibition was reached at 30 \u00b5M for U-937 (80%) and KG-1 (75%), respectively. We then combined SR1078 with MEC to evaluate whether in vitro SR1078 increased MEC growth inhibition. The addition of SR1078 to MEC significantly decreased cell viability in KG-1 cells compared to MEC alone (82% vs. 19%, P= .029). Our study suggests that increased ROR a expression may be associated with improved survival in patients with R/R AML and that ROR a may be a potential therapeutic target in AML.
