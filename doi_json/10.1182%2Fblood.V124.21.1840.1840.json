    "abstract_text": "Background : Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm defined by erythrocytosis; patients may also have increased platelets and white blood cells as well as splenomegaly and disease-related symptoms. JAK/STAT activation is the primary driver of PV pathogenesis, in most cases resulting from the JAK2 V617F mutation. The RESPONSE trial compared ruxolitinib (RUX) and best available therapy (BAT) in patients with PV and splenomegaly who were intolerant of or resistant to hydroxyurea (HU) according to modified European LeukemiaNet criteria. At the time of the primary analysis, RUX demonstrated superior improvements in hematocrit (HCT) control, symptom burden, and spleen volume compared with BAT. This post hoc analysis of RESPONSE was conducted to determine if treatment outcomes were influenced by baseline spleen volume. Methods : Patients with PV \u226518 years of age who were resistant to or intolerant of HU with palpable spleen (confirmed by MRI/CT to be \u2265450 cm 3 ) and phlebotomy requirement were randomized 1:1 to receive open-label RUX 10 mg BID or BAT. The primary endpoint was a composite that required a \u226535% reduction in spleen volume at Week 32 and hematocrit (HCT) control. HCT control was defined as lack of phlebotomy eligibility (based on HCT values) between Weeks 8\u201332 with no more than 1 phlebotomy eligibility between randomization and Week 8. A linear regression was conducted to determine the effect of baseline spleen volume on the percent change in spleen volume at Week 32. A logistic regression was conducted to determine the effect of baseline spleen volume on HCT control through Week 32. Spleen volume was measured by MRI at screening and Weeks 16 and 32. Hematocrit was assessed at screening, prerandomization, and every 2 weeks from Day 1 to Week 12, followed by every 4 weeks until Week 32. Results : The RESPONSE trial enrolled 222 patients (RUX, 110; BAT, 112). Median (range) spleen volume at baseline was 1195 cm 3 (396\u20134631 cm 3 ) in the RUX arm and 1322 cm 3 (254\u20135147 cm 3 ) in the BAT arm. Baseline median (range) spleen length by palpation was 7.0 cm (0.0\u201324.0 cm) in the RUX arm and 7.0 cm (0.0\u201325.0 cm) in the BAT arm. In the 24 weeks prior to screening, most patients in both arms had \u22652 phlebotomy procedures (RUX, 87%; BAT, 80%). There was no correlation between the percentage change in spleen volume at Week 32 and baseline spleen volume; linear regression showed no significant effect of baseline spleen volume on the percentage change in spleen volume at Week 32 ( P =0.40). No significant effect of baseline spleen volume on HCT control through Week 32 was identified based on logistic regression analysis ( P =0.37). Conclusion : In PV patients with inadequate response to or intolerant of HU, the degree of splenomegaly at baseline did not influence achievement of HCT control or reduction in spleen volume with RUX therapy.
