    "abstract_text": "Background: We have previously reported high anti-tumor activity of autologous T cells genetically modified to express 19-28z chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting CD19 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) ALL (Park et al. ASH 2014). Herein, we further report the long-term outcome of a larger cohort from our phase 1 clinical trial in adults with R/R ALL (NCT01044069) with a focused analysis on the role of post-treatment minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity as a predictive marker of survival as well as the effect of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) prior to or after CAR T cell infusion on safety and clinical outcome. Patients and Methods: Adult patients with R/R B-cell ALL (B-ALL) were enrolled. Eligible patients underwent leukapheresis, and T cells were transduced with a retroviral vector encoding a CAR comprising a CD19-specific scFv and CD28 and CD3\u03b6 signaling domains (19-28z). All patients received lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed 2 days later by 1x10 6 - 3x10 6 19-28z CAR T cells/kg. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of 19-28z CAR T cells. Post-treatment MRD was assessed at day 14-28 by multiparameter flow cytometry in bone marrow (BM) samples. Results: 44 patients have been treated to date. The median age was 45 years (range, 22-74). 14 patients (32%) had Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) ALL (T315I mutation in 5 patients), 17 patients (39%) had prior allo-HSCT, and 24 patients (55%) had \u2265 3 prior lines of ALL therapy. Of the 44 patients, 43 patients were evaluable for response. At the time of 19-28z CAR T cell infusion, 22 of the 43 patients (51%) had morphologic disease (\u22655% blasts in BM or measurable extramedullary disease) and the remaining 21 patients had minimal disease (<5% blasts in BM). 36 patients (84%) were in complete remission (CR) after 19-28z CAR T-cell infusion. MRD analysis was performed in 35 of 36 CR patients, and 29 of these 35 patients (83%) achieved an MRD-negative CR (MRD-CR). As of July 13, 2015, the median follow-up was 4.2 months (range 1-45), with 16 patients having at least 6 months of follow-up. Responses appear durable with 7 patients remaining disease-free beyond 1 year up to 45 months. A median overall survival (OS) of all patients and patients who achieved MRD-CR is 8.5 months and 10.8 months, respectively. Post-treatment MRD status emerged as a strong predictive marker of OS: OS at 6 months was 76% (95% CI: 51-89) in the MRD-CR cohort vs. 14% (95% CI: 8-45) in the MRD+CR cohort. In contrast, allo-HSCT after achieving CR with CAR T cell infusion did not affect the survival rate. Of the 36 patients in CR following the T cell infusion, 12 patients underwent allo-HSCT. OS at 6 months was 70% (95% CI: 33-89) in patients who underwent post-CAR allo-HSCT vs. 64% (95% CI: 36-82) in patients who did not get allo-HSCT after CAR T cells. Comparing baseline disease characteristics of patients who had prior allo-HSCT before the CAR T cell treatment vs. no prior allo-HSCT, patients who had prior allo-HSCT (n=17) were similar in age (median age 45 vs. 46), but had higher disease burden (65% with morphologic disease vs. 44%), were more heavily pretreated (59% of patients with \u22654 lines of therapy vs. 15%), and included more high-risk disease (41% with Ph+ ALL vs. 26%). However, there was no statistically significant difference in CR rates (75%, CI: 48-93 vs. 89%, CI: 71-98), incidences of severe cytokine release syndrome (24% vs. 22%), and OS at 6 months (57% vs. 60%) between these two cohorts. Fewer patients who had prior allo-HSCT underwent another allo-HSCT following CAR T cell infusion: 2 patients vs. 10 patients with no prior all-HSCT. Although no obvious case of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) was noted, one patient experienced a grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity that may have been related to GvHD. Conclusions: These data confirm the potent anti-tumor efficacy of 19-28z CAR T cells (JCAR015) in adult patients with R/R ALL. MRD negativity following the 19-28z CAR T cell treatment is highly predictive of survival, and allo-HSCT post-CAR T cell infusion had no significant impact on survival. Furthermore, 19-28z CAR T cells appear to be safe in patients who had prior allo-HSCT, and may represent an attractive alternative option to second allo-HSCT. These findings are being confirmed in an ongoing multi-center, pivotal phase 2 trial evaluating JCAR015 in adult patients with R/R ALL.
