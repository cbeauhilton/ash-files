    "abstract_text": "Background PMBCL is a clinical/biological distinct entity, sharing some characteristics with both classical DLBCL and Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. MACOP B is considered the treatment of choice. Methods Starting from 1997, we treated PMBCL with an ICHOP regimen including cyclophosphamide 1750 mg/mq with MESNA uroprotection, doxorubicin 75 mg/mq, vincristine 1.4 mg/mq with 2 mg cap, and prednisone 100 mg d 1\u20135 of each 14-day courses, GCSF from day 7 to day 12. Rituximab (R) 375mg/mq/course was added to ICHOP (R-ICHOP) from 2002. Treatment plan included five courses of ICHOP\u00b1R. Cases with unfavourable prognosis according to age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (aaIPI2\u20133) were submitted to high dose chemotherapy (HDT) and peripheral stem cell rescue. Radiotherapy on involved sites was then delivered to all patients if at least partial remission (PR) was reached. Clinical response was evaluated through CT +/\u2212 Gallium scan (14 pts) up to 2002, and thorough CT + PET scan (16 pts) thereafter, according to Cheson criteria. Results : up to 2006, 30 pts were treated, with the following characteristics: M/F 10/20, median age 34 years (range 22\u201353), Ann Arbor stage I: 4, II \u2013IIE:19, III: 1, IV: 6; bulky disease: 29; B symptoms: 14; aa IPI 0\u20131: 24, 2\u20133: 6; RICHOP/ICHOP 21/9. After ICHOP\u00b1R 15 patients achieved complete (CR) or unconfirmed complete remission (CRU), 14 PR, 1 stable disease. At the end of the whole program 29/30 pts reached CR and one progressed. Seven pts received HDT, six following ICHOP\u00b1R and one after II line chemotherapy for refractory disease. After a median observation time of 60 months 1 patient progressed and 1 patient relapsed, respectively. Both died of lymphoma. One patient with stage IIE IPI 0 relapsed 18 months after completion of ICHOP and RT and died after further 5 treatment lines including alloBMT. The other patient with stage II EB IPI 1, progressed shortly after R-ICHOP and RT and died five months later. Five-yr failure free survival and overall survival are 93.2 and 92.8, respectively. ICHOP\u00b1R was well tolerated, with neither toxic death or life-threatening toxicity. No patient interrupted the planned treatment because of toxicity. Hospitalization was required in seven cases due to febrile neutropenia (6), hemorrhagic cystitis (3 cases), and pneumonia (1). Five episodes of grade III\u2013IV mucositis were observed in 4 patients. Of 147 delivered cycles, 25 were delayed (13 pts). Conclusion : in PMBCL, the results obtained with the ICHOP protocol are better than standard CHOP and comparable to MACOP-B, emphasizing the role of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide dose-intensity. In this limited series, the impact of adding rituximab is not clear.  . R-ICHOP . ICHOP . Tot. .
