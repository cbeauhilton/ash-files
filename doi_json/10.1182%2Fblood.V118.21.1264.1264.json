    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1264 Background: Recombinant activated coagulation factor VII (rFVIIa) has been increasingly used in non-hemophiliac patients for unapproved indications. We undertook a 10 year nation-wide retrospective survey in order to evaluate the use of rFVIIa in Iceland in patients with intractable extra-cranial hemorrhage. Material and methods: Hospital charts of all patients that received rFVIIa between 1999\u20132008 at Landspitali, the single institution administering rFVIIa in Iceland, were reviewed and indications, coagulation profiles and clinical outcome were evaluated. This analysis focuses on patients treated off-label for desperate (intractable) extra-cranial hemorrhage (IH), ie only patients in who all other measures were considered to have failed to stop hemorrhage. Results: rFVIIa was used for IH in 55 patients (median age 53 yrs, range; 0\u201384, 51% males). This included IH in open heart surgery (n=23), non-cardiac surgery (n=7), post-partum hemorrhage (n=9), multitrauma (n=8) and miscellaneous (n=8). A single rFVIIa dose was used in 86% of cases and hemorrhage was considered effectively contained by immediate clinical response to rFVIIa in 81% of the IH cases. Survival at 30 days for all patients was 68%. Out of 55 patients with IH, six died within 24 hours of administration of rFVIIa (five assessed clinically as rFVIIa non-responders) and 11 other patients (total 17 patients, 31%) died within 30 days (six non-responders). The 24-hour mortality in rFVIIa clinical responders and non-responders was 2% and 50% respectively (p=0.0004) and the 30 day mortality was 25% and 60% respectively (p=0.05). The need for transfusion of blood products was significantly decreased (p<0.01) and also the prothrombin time (20.0 to 13.3 sec, p<0.0001). Conclusion: The majority of unselected consecutive patients receiving rFVIIa as last resort treatment for IH were considered to have favorable immediate clinical response as well as reduced transfusion requirements and normalisation of coagulation parameters. Also, patients deemed with clinical response to rFVIIa may have had lower mortality. Disclosures: Off Label Use: Activated recombinant factor VII for use in desperately bleeding patients."
