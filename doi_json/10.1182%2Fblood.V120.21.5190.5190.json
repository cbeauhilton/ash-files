    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5190 Rationale: Circulating endothelial cell-derived microparticles (MP) are altered in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) but whether they are biomarkers of cellular injury or participants in disease pathogenesis is unknown. We have shown that lung-derived MP induce marrow cells to express lung-specific mRNA, protein. Objectives: Determine if lung, plasma-derived MP (LMP, PMP) alter pulmonary vascular endothelial or marrow progenitor cell phenotype to induce pulmonary vascular remodeling in PAH. Methods and Main Results: LMP, PMP isolated from monocrotaline (MCT)- or vehicle-treated mice were injected into healthy mice. Right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy and pulmonary vascular remodeling were assessed by RV-to-body weight (RV/BW), blood vessel wall thickness-to-diameter (WT/D) ratios. RV/BW, WT/D ratios were elevated in MCT vs. vehicle-injected mice (1. 99+0. 09vs. 1. 04+0. 09mg/g; 0. 159+0. 002vs. 0. 062+0. 009%). MP from MCT and vehicle-treated mice were quantitatively similar; however, MCT-LMP had higher endothelial cell mRNA expression and higher expression of mRNAs of proteins known to be abnormally expressed in PAH vs. vehicle-LMP. RV/BW, WT/D ratios were higher in mice injected with MCT-MP vs. mice injected with vehicle-MP (1. 63+0. 09vs. 1. 08+0. 09mg/g; 0. 113+0. 02vs. 0. 056+0. 01%). Lineage-depleted bone marrow cells co-cultured with MCT-MP and bone marrow cells isolated from MCT-MP infused mice had higher endothelial progenitor cell gene expression vs. cells co-cultured with vehicle-MP or cells isolated from vehicle MP infused mice. Conclusions: MP from MCT-injured mice have increased expression of growth factors implicated in PAH pathogenesis and induce RV hypertrophy, pulmonary vascular remodeling in healthy mice. Circulating MP may contribute to the development of MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension by inducing a pathologic phenotype in pulmonary vascular endothelial and endothelial progenitor cells.
