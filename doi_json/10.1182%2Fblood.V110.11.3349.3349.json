    "abstract_text": "Normal DNA replication must be accurate and occur only once per cell cycle. Sites of DNA replication are specified by binding the origin recognition complex, that includes minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins. Paradoxically, in higher eukaryotes MCM proteins are present in >20 fold excess of that required for DNA replication. They are also downregulated by elevated expression of proteins such as cyclin E that occurs in cancers, including AML and breast cancer. We investigated why human cells need \u201cexcess\u201d MCM proteins and whether the reduction of MCM protein levels might contribute to a malignant phenotype. We determined the consequences of reducing the levels of MCM proteins in primary human T cells in which cell cycle controls and DNA damage responses are normal. Mass spectrometry sequencing of chromatin/nuclear matrix-bound proteins and western blotting identified that Mcm7 is not present in quiescent, normal primary human T cells. Mcm7 is induced in mid G 1 after the G 0 \u2192G 1 commitment point, the point beyond which T cells are committed to entering the cell cycle. Reduction of Mcm7 with siRNA to <5% of normal during G 0 \u2192G 1 \u2192S-phase reduces chromatin-binding of each of the MCM proteins that form the DNA helicase. However, these cells still enter S-phase and replicate DNA. Reducing MCM levels by titrating siRNA causes dose-dependent DNA-damage responses involving activation of ATR & ATM and Chk1 & Chk2. However, cells depleted of Mcm7 do not undergo apoptosis, rather reducing MCM levels even by 50% causes gross non-clonal chromosomal abnormalities normally found in genomic instability syndromes. M-FISH identified chromosome translocations, as well as loss and gain of individual chromosomes, which can occur individually or together in the same cell. Reducing MCM levels also causes misrepair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and both NHEJ and homologous recombination (HR) are necessary for chromosomal abnormalities to occur. Therefore, \u201cexcess\u201d MCM proteins that are present in a normal, proliferating cell are necessary for maintaining genome stability and reduction of MCM loading onto DNA that occurs in cancers is sufficient to cause genomic instability."
