    "abstract_text": "Abstract 703 The classic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are frequently associated with the JAK2 V617F mutation or other genetic alterations in members of the JAK-STAT axis. These mutations have been shown to cause hyperactivated JAK-STAT signaling in cell lines and mouse models. How accurately these models recapitulate human MPN pathogenesis remains uncertain, as in vivo signaling in MPNs is likely modulated by other genetic changes and regulatory dynamics. In addition, the phenotypic changes that accompany transformation of chronic MPNs to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) have not been well characterized. While targeted inhibitors of JAK2 have shown activity in MPNs, the incomplete responses observed clinically have called into question the utility of JAK2 as a therapeutic target, suggesting that dysregulation of other signaling pathways may be important in MPN pathogenesis. Therefore, a more complete assessment of JAK-STAT and related signaling pathways in MPNs is needed. Mass cytometry is a novel technology that merges aspects of flow cytometry with mass spectrometry \u2013 cells are labeled with antibodies conjugated to elemental isotope reporters and then analyzed on the CyTOF mass cytometer. Each mass channel is distinct, such that no compensation is required, thus circumventing the spectral limitations of fluorescence-based flow cytometry and enabling the simultaneous measurement of 30+ parameters at the single cell level. We have utilized this approach to examine multiple signaling effectors in cell populations throughout hematopoietic differentiation. Our initial experiment included samples from three MPN patients (PV, PMF, post-PV sAML), and one normal donor. Cells were exposed to nine different perturbation conditions ex vivo , including cytokines and the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. Cells were stained with a panel of 17 surface markers and 13 dynamic intracellular signaling effectors and analyzed on the CyTOF. Single cell data was uploaded into SPADE (spanning-tree analysis of density-normalized events), which distills multidimensional data down to interconnected cell subsets and creates 2D tree plots based on shared surface marker expression. These plots identified recognizable cell subsets, including hematopoietic stem/progenitors (HSPCs) and myeloid and lymphoid lineage subsets. Heat maps were constructed to depict the relative induction of each intracellular marker in response to each condition. In the HSPC compartment, several expected responses were observed, particularly in PV. Erythropoietin-mediated activation of STAT3 and thrombopoietin (Tpo)-mediated activation of STAT3/5 were enhanced in PV committed progenitors. On a broader level, PV HSPCs exhibited heightened signaling sensitivities involving several cytokines and downstream effectors. Notably, CREB and S6 phosphorylation were strongly induced by Tpo, G-CSF, and IL-3. Ruxolitinib pre-treatment markedly inhibited signaling mediated by Tpo in PV CD34+ cells, indicating that the HSPC compartment can be effectively targeted by ex vivo JAK1/2 inhibition. In contrast to PV, PMF HSPCs exhibited lesser sensitivity to cytokine stimulation. In several instances, such as IL-3 induction of pSTAT5, the responses were in fact suppressed compared to normal. CD34+ HSPC from the sAML patient generally exhibited subnormal signaling responses. However, widespread hyperactivation following exposure to the phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate (PVO4) was observed in sAML CD34+ cells, suggesting that these signaling pathways were activated in vivo , but that feedback inhibition in response to persistent activity led to downregulation of their ex vivo inducibility. Based on these preliminary findings, we hypothesize that the fundamental chronic phase MPN state is one of heightened cytokine signaling sensitivity, while the advanced phase (especially sAML) state is one of tonic or constitutive downstream signaling activity with persistent feedback inhibition on cytokine signaling pathways. To test this hypothesis, experiments with a larger cohort of MPN samples are currently underway. These studies will provide a comprehensive framework of altered signaling in MPNs and provide deeper insights into the role of targeted therapy for MPNs.
