    "abstract_text": "Myeloablative conditioning for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) leads to a fast increase of non-transferrin bound iron, including the labile plasma iron (LPI) pool, mainly due to suppression of erythropoiesis. It has been suggested that increased LPI, the redox-active and toxic form of iron, may cause cell damage and ultimately lead to tissue toxicity and other complications commonly observed in the early post-HSCT period. However, this assumption has not been reported yet in this setting. In order to evaluate if increased LPI levels following conditioning can cause cell toxicity, we assessed its impact on viability of mononuclear cells obtained from eight patients undergoing autologous HSCT for multiple myeloma (n=4) and lymphoma (n=4). Firstly, LPI was measured in plasma samples obtained from each patient before (baseline) and after conditioning (on day 0), revealing normal levels (0,05). In conclusion, these results indicate that increased LPI levels can decrease substantially the viability of mononuclear cells, an effect that can be prevented or at least attenuated by the use of iron chelators.
