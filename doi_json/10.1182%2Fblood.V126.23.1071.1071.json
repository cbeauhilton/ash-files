    "abstract_text": "Immune response to factor VIII (FVIII) is not only a severe complication in protein replacement therapy, but also a major concern in gene therapy of hemophilia A. Our previous studies have demonstrated that platelet-targeted FVIII (2bF8) gene therapy together with in vivo drug-selection of transduced cells can not only rescue the bleeding diathesis but also induce anti-FVIII specific immune tolerance in FVIII null mice. In the current study, we investigated 1) whether our non-selectable lentiviral vector (LV) for the induction of platelet-FVIII expression is sufficient to induce immune tolerance and 2) which cell compartment is tolerized after platelet gene therapy. Platelet-specific FVIII expression was introduced by 2bF8LV-transduction of hematopoietic stem cells followed by syngeneic transplantation into FVIII null mice preconditioned with 660 cGy total body irradiation (TBI) or Busulfan (Bu) plus ATG (anti-thymocyte globulin). After bone marrow transplantation and reconstitution, animals were analyzed by PCR, qPCR, FVIII:C assay, and tail clipping test to confirm the success of 2bF8 gene therapy. Sixteen weeks after transplantation, animals were challenged with recombinant human FVIII (rhF8) via retro-orbital venous administration at a dose of 50 U/kg weekly for 4 weeks. The titers of anti-FVIII inhibitory antibodies (inhibitors) were determined by Bethesda assay. The CFSE-labeled CD4 T cell proliferation assay and ELISPOT-based memory B cell maturation assay were used to determine which cell compartment is tolerized to FVIII after 2bF8 gene therapy. The level of platelet-FVIII expression was 1.44 \u00b1 0.39 mU/10 8 platelets (n = 6) in the 660 cGy group, which is not significantly different from the level obtained from the Bu+ATG group [3.04 \u00b1 1.19 mU/10 8 platelets (n = 6)]. Even after rhF8 challenge, no antibodies were detected in 2bF8LV-transduced recipients in either group. In contrast, all animals in the control group that did not undergo gene therapy developed various levels of inhibitors (204\u00b197 BU/ml, n=7). The frequency of regulatory T cells in both 660 cGy TBI (11.01\u00b10.52%) and Bu+ATG (11.02\u00b10.68%) groups were significantly higher than the control group (8.05\u00b10.57%). T cell proliferation assay demonstrated that CD4 + T cells from 2bF8 LV-transduced recipients that had been challenged with rhF8 did not proliferate when restimulated with rhF8 in vitro. The daughter CD4 + T cells in the group with 10 U/ml of rhF8 were 5.84 \u00b1 2.49% (n = 6), which was not significantly different from the control group without no rhF8 stimulation (0 U/ml) (5.33 \u00b1 1.72%). CD4 + T cells from primed FVIII null mice did proliferate after rhF8 restimulation. The proliferated daughter cell was 13.12 \u00b1 6.76% (n = 7) in the group with rhF8 (10 U/ml) re-stimulation, which is significantly higher than the group without rhF8 co-culture (4.99 \u00b1 1.16%). Since FVIII-specific memory B cell maturation is CD4 + T cell dependent, we isolated CD4 + T and memory B cells from 2bF8LV-transduced or FVIII null mice after rhF8 immunization and co-cultured with rhF8 followed by ELISPOT assay to examine the antibody secreting cells. No spots were detected when memory B cells from rhF8-primed FVIII null mice were co-cultured with CD4 + T cells from 2bF8LV-transduced recipients. In contrast, when memory B cells from either rhF8 immunized 2bF8LV-transduced or untreated FVIII null mice were cultured with CD4 + T cells from rhF8-primed FVIII null mice, there were 142 and 205 anti-FVIII antibody secreting cells, respectively, detected per 10 6 cells seeded. These results indicate that CD4 + T cells from 2bF8LV-transduced mice are tolerized to rhF8 stimulation. In conclusion, 2bF8 lentiviral gene transfer without in vivo selection of genetically manipulated cells can introduce FVIII-specific immune tolerance in hemophilia A mice and this immune tolerance is CD4 + T cell-mediated.
