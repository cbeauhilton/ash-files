    "abstract_text": "Deletions of chromosome 13 occur in about 50% of multiple myeloma (MM) patients, with monosomy being the most common (85%), and small interstitial deletions, often involving the Rb gene, representing only 15% of cases. In contrast to CLL, where a minimal deleted region (MDR) has been mapped to the DLEU2/miR-15a/16-1 locus, no MDR has been identified in MM. The prognostic significance of monosomy 13 has been overshadowed by its strong association with high-risk MM, mostly t(4;14) and t(14;16) translocations. Genomic analysis of 28 MM tumors from Vk*MYC mice identified recurrent (27%) monosomy of the syntenic chromosome 14, with focal bi-allelic deletions of Rb1 in three independent tumors. One tumor presented a focal monoallelic interstitial deletion of the mirR15a-16.1 cluster. Reasoning that the biological significance of monosomy 13 would be conserved between human and murine MM, we carried out genetic crosses between Vk*MYC and mice heterozygous for Rb1 (MYC/Rb1), for the DLEU2/miR-15a/16-1 locus (MYC/MDR) or for the miR-15a/16-1 cluster only (MYC/MIR). All of the MYC/Rb1 mice died around one year of age of pituitary tumors without a significant plasma cell expansion compared to the Vk*MYC mice alone. In contrast, both the MYC/MDR+/- and MYC/MIR+/- mice exhibited a progressive monoclonal plasmacytosis affecting secondary lymphoid organs, with associated shorter overall survival. The development of extra-medullary MM was further accelerated in MYC/MDR -/- and MYC/MIR -/- mice, and was reminiscent of that observed in Vk*MYC crossed with Emu-BCL2 mice. As previously shown for the CLL-like disease that develops in the MIR and MDR mice, the MM phenotype is more pronounced in the MYC/MDR than the MYC/MIR, and in the homozygous than the heterozygous mice. Although BCL2 has been proposed as a target of the miR-15a/16-1, it has not been identified among genes whose expression is altered in MIR null B lymphocytes, where instead miR-15a/16-1 deletion promotes proliferation. In contrast, we found significant BCL2 upregulation in some MM tumors from MYC/MIR and MYC/MDR, suggesting that miR-15a/16-1 deletion in MM provides a survival signal that renders plasma cells less dependent on the BM microenvironment. We propose that selection for monosomy 13 in MM is driven in at least in part by loss of one copy of the miR cluster.
