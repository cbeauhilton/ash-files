    "abstract_text": "Diagnosis and monitoring of therapy in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) depend on cytogenetic, FISH, and PCR assays for detecting the fusion bcr-abl gene. However, the there is an inherent variability and difficulty in standardizing quantitative PCR-based assays. We assessed the utility of a simplified immunoassay for measuring levels of Bcr-Abl protein and phosphorylated Bcr-Abl for diagnosis of CML and detection of minimal residual disease (MRD). Bcr-Abl protein was immunoprecipitated on beads with anti-Bcr antibody, and the fusion protein was detected with anti-Abl antibody. Phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated Bcr-Abl was measured using antibodies against phosphorylated Abl protein at tyr245 and thr735. Because the relatively high turnover of leukemic cells enriches plasma with leukemic DNA, RNA, and protein, as we previously reported, this assay can use cell lysate as well as PB plasma. In vitro studies with denatured K562 cells in plasma showed reliable detection at levels as low as 10 cells/mL plasma. After exposure of cell cultures to 0.5 \u03bcM imatinib, K562 cell lysates exhibited a decreased ratio of phosphorylated Bcr-Abl protein:total Bcr-Abl protein with both the tyr245 (from 0.53 to 0.11) and the thr735 (from 0.36 to 0.08) antibodies. The assay was validated by demonstrating negativity (specificity) in 116 normal control subjects (or patients with other translocations) and positivity in all 380 positive samples, as confirmed by FISH or cytogenetics. The CV for inter- and intra-assay variation was 0.05) had significantly more relative phosphorylated Bcr-Abl protein than those with low disease activity ( P =0.05). In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that Bcr-Abl and phosphorylated Bcr-Abl are detectable at significant levels in the plasma of CML patients and that these levels can be used to monitor MRD. This free circulating Bcr-Abl protein is most likely complexed with other proteins. Unlike PCR-based assays, our ELISA-like assay can be standardized for use in various laboratories. More importantly, the CV of the immunoassay (<6%) is much lower than that typically reported for RT-PCR (up to 30%). We speculate that the use of plasma rather than cells in this assay allows more accurate quantitative measurement of the disease in the whole body, without potential bias due to sampling errors.",
