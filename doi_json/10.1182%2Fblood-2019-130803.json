    "abstract_text": "Platelets are specialized anucleate cells that circulate in the blood and serve to prevent bleeding and minimize blood vessel injury. In addition to their hemostatic functions, platelets participate in wound healing, angiogenesis, inflammation, and immunity, and are therefore central players in both maintaining normal physiology and in disease pathogenesis. Platelets are derived from their precursor cells, megakaryocytes (MKs), that reside principally in the bone marrow. During maturation, MKs undergo an altered cell cycle called endomitosis in which they replicate their DNA but avoid cell division, resulting in polyploid MKs with amplified microtubule (MT)-organizing centers called centrosomes. Subsequently, MT-dependent forces are responsible for extending long cytoplasmic protrusions called proplatelets into sinusoidal blood vessels, eventually giving rise to circulating platelets. Despite progress in elucidating key steps of platelet production, there is a conspicuous lack of understanding of what triggers mature, polyploid MKs to undergo the MT rearrangements required for proplatelet production. Using live cell imaging of mouse fetal liver-derived MKs expressing fluorescent b1-tubulin, we have identified a novel MT-based structure in MKs termed a monospindle. Our data suggest that monospindles result from polyploid MKs clustering multiple centrosomes into a centralized MT-organizing center during mitosis, leading to an enlarged array of MTs oriented towards the cell cortex. These structures were also apparent in mouse bone marrow- and human cord blood-derived MKs, suggesting that monospindle formation is a general phenomenon in MKs. Interestingly, a higher percentage of MKs contained monospindles at a timepoint directly prior to proplatelet production (50%) compared to when proplatelets were actively being produced (22%), indicating a possible role in initiating proplatelet formation. Centrosome clustering in cancer cells is mediated by the MT-based mitotic motor protein, KIFC1. Consistently, we found that small molecule inhibition of KIFC1 decreased the percentage of MKs containing monospindles (55% ctrl vs. 6% KIFC1 inhibitor). Strikingly, KIFC1 inhibitor treatment also drastically reduced the percentage of MKs producing proplatelets (peak proplatelet formation: 40% ctrl vs. 5% KIFC1 inhibitor), suggesting that KIFC1-mediated centrosome clustering into monospindles is important for proplatelet production. To test how KIFC1 contributes to these phenotypes, we assessed its expression at different timepoints by Western blot and detected increased KIFC1 levels in more mature MKs preceding proplatelet formation. Cell sorting of MKs into distinct ploidy populations followed by Western blot showed that KIFC1 expression increased with higher ploidy. Thus, our results lead us to suggest a working model in which elevated KIFC1 levels in mature MKs drive monospindle formation to trigger proplatelet formation. Investigating the role of KIFC1-mediated monospindle formation for initiating proplatelet formation could yield a coherent, molecular understanding of how mature, polyploid MKs reorganize MTs for proplatelet production. In addition, these data will help inform basic cell biology, as there are important parallels between centrosome clustering in MKs and cancer cells. Finally, our findings could yield novel therapeutic strategies for treating patients with thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) by directly stimulating platelet production from mature MKs residing in the bone marrow.
