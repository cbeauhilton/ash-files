    "abstract_text": "Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by a high relapse rate, indicating insufficient clearance of leukemia-initiating cells. Depending on genetic risk stratification, consolidating chemotherapy proves to significantly reduce the risk of relapse. In particular, in younger AML patients higher dosage of cytarabine appears to improve long-term outcome, while there is no apparent benefit of multiagent combination, compared to cytarabine monotherapy. However, to this end the optimal dosage of single agent cytarabine in consolidation therapy after 7+3 remission induction remains elusive. Methods: Here, we retrospectively assessed the impact of different dosages of cytarabine consolidation on outcome in a large real-world data set from the German Study Alliance Leukemia-Acute Myeloid Leukemia (SAL-AML) registry. Patients below 65 years of age, registered between April 2005 and September 2020 with non-acute promyelocytic leukemia, who attained complete remission after intensive induction and received at least one consolidation cycle with intermediate (IDAC) or high dose cytarabine (HiDAC) were selected. To account for differences in patient and disease characteristics between both groups, the average treatment effect was estimated by propensity score weighting. Results: 642 patients received HiDAC consolidation with a median dosage of 5794.88 (IQR, 4745.48-5971.56) mg/m 2 /d with a median number of 3 cycles (IQR, 2-3), whereas 178 patients received IDAC consolidation with 1946.16 (IQR, 1869.51-2469.15) mg/m 2 /d with a median of 2 cycles (IQR, 1-3). IDAC-treated patients showed in average a higher age (median (IQR) 58.5 (49-62) years vs. 50 (41-56) years) and more comorbidities with 43.8% having an HCT-CI score of 2-4, compared to 22.3% among HiDAC-treated patients. Alongside, significantly more secondary (5.1% vs. 3.1%) and therapy-related (12.4% vs. 4.1%) AML as well as more adverse (14.5% vs. 6.5%) and less favorable (40.6% vs. 56%) genetic risk features according to ELN 2017 risk classification were found among IDAC-treated patients. After propensity score weighting for differences in patient and disease characteristics, overall survival after 5 years was comparable between HiDAC-treated (71.1 %) and IDAC-treated (67.7%) patients. Moreover, no significant differences in relapse-free survival were observed after 5 years (47.4 vs. 45.2%). Notably, more patients treated with IDAC received allogeneic stem cell transplantation in first remission (37.6 vs. 19.8%) while significantly more HiDAC-treated patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation in relapse (30.8 vs. 20.2%). Censoring for allogeneic stem cell transplantation in first remission revealed no significant survival difference with regard to cytarabine dosage. Considering only ELN favorable risk AML patients, there was no difference in 5-years overall (80.5% vs. 83.9%) nor relapse-free (57.7% vs. 56.8%) survival. Of note, significantly more patients treated with HiDAC suffered from \u22653 CTCAE infectious complications (56.7 vs. 44.1%), which was more striking in patients above 50 years of age. The rate of other \u22653 CTCAE non-hematological toxicities and secondary malignancies was comparable in both treatment groups. Conclusion: This retrospective analysis suggests no significant benefit of high dose cytarabine compared to intermediate dosages in consolidation for AML patients under 65 years of age, independent of ELN risk group.
