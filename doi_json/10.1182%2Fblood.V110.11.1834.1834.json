    "abstract_text": "Background: Although ATRA and anthracyclines provide durable remissions in patients with untreated APL, we have reported that ATRA plus As 2 O 3 may do the same while avoiding \u201cchemotherapy.\u201d However, follow-up of patients treated with ATRA plus As 2 O 3 has been relatively limited, prompting this report. Methods: From 2/02 to 4/07, 67 patients with untreated APL were given ATRA 45 mg/m 2 daily followed by As 2 O 3 0.15 mg/kg IV 1-hr infusion daily starting on D10. Patients with leukocyte counts (WBC) > 10\u00d710 9 /L (low-risk) also received gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) 9 mg/m 2 on D1 and/or idarubicin 12 mg/m 2 on D1-4. Patients in complete remission (CR) received As 2 O 3 0.15 mg/kg IV on D1-5 weekly for 4 weeks on and 4 weeks off and ATRA 45 mg/m 2 daily for 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off (for 28 weeks). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for PML-RAR\u03b1 (sensitivity level, 10 \u22124 ) was performed every 3 months from CR for at least 2 yrs. Patients with molecular relapse, defined by two sequential positive PCR tests for PML-RAR\u03b1 within 2 wks, received GO 9 mg/m 2 once monthly for 3 months in addition to ATRA and As 2 O 3 as in post-remission therapy. If the PCR results subsequently became negative, low-risk patients received no chemotherapy and high-risk patients received a single dose of GO. Results: The median patient age was 46 yrs (range, 14\u201381), and 30% were >60 yrs. Thirty-six percent of patients had WBC \u226510\u00d710 9 /L, 54% had coagulopathy, and 27% had Zubrod performance status (PS) > 1. The overall response rate was 91% (CR 90%, CRp 1%). The median time to response was 29 days (range, 19\u201370). Response rates were higher in patients with PS 0\u20131 (98% vs. 72%, p=.001), no coagulopathy (100% vs. 83%, p=.02), and LDH <1.5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN)(97% vs. 83%, p=.046). The median follow-up in surviving patients is 25 months. Six patients died during induction; 1 died with central nervous system relapse; and 3 died in remission from other metastatic cancers (malignant melanoma, 1; breast, 1; and prostate, 1). The 2-yr survival rate was 84%. Survival rates were higher in patients with PS<1 (p=.0004), no coagulopathy (p=.01), and LDH <1.5\u00d7ULN (p=.02). The 2-yr failure-free survival (FFS) rate in responding patients was 92% (Sanz risk: low and intermediate 100%; high, 78%). Four patients relapsed (at 9, 9, 13, and 16 months); molecular relapse preceded hematologic relapse by 21, 23, 38, and 128 days, respectively. None of the remaining patients had evidence of molecular relapse. WBC \u226510\u00d710 9 /L (p=.006), LDH \u22651.5\u00d7ULN (p=.02), and high Sanz risk (p=.02) predicted relapse.

Conclusions: ATRA plus As 2 O 3 results in high rates of CR, molecular remission, FFS, and survival. PCR testing for PML-RAR\u03b1 accurately predicted relapse and should be performed in high-risk patients during the first year after CR.",
