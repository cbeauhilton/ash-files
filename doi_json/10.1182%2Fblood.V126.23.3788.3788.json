    "abstract_text": "Background: Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 ( IDH1/2 MT ) occur in up to 20% of MDS, MDS/MPN overlap and (s)AML. These mutations induce a metabolic rewiring of cancer cells that may impose metabolic vulnerabilities which can be pharmacologically targeted. In carcinoma cells, IDH1 MT sensitize cells to oxidative stress induced by irradiation and treatment with electron transport chain complex I inhibitors, such as phenformin and metformin. Conversely, IDH1 MT inhibitors protect IDH1 MT cells against these treatment modalities. As a consequence, IDH1 MT inhibitors and cytotoxic drugs should not be used together in patients with IDH1 MT carcinoma and this has clinical relevance since IDH1/2 MT inhibitors are already in phase I clinical trials. The underlying mechanism is that IDH1 MT dramatically reduce the cellular production capacity of NADPH, an important antioxidant, and IDH1 MT inhibitors restore the NADPH production capacity. Of note, IDH1 and IDH2 are the most important providers of NADPH in most cells. Methods: Primary IDH1/2 MT , IDH1/2 WT and TET2 MT AML cells (n=15) were cultured and treated with the IDH1 MT inhibitor AGI-5198, the IDH2 MT inhibitor AGI-6780, irradiation, phenformin, metformin, daunorubicin or cytarabine. Cell numbers were counted 5 days after therapy exposure. In addition, cells were adhered to microscopy slides and maximal IDH1/2 and G6PD activity was determined using quantitative enzyme cytochemistry. ROS levels were fluorometrically measured using flow cytometry. Results: We observed that IDH1/2 MT do not sensitize primary AML cells to irradiation, phenformin, metformin, daunorubicin or cytarabine and IDH1/2 MT inhibitors had no effect on therapy sensitivity in primary AML cells. Because it is argued that inactivating TET2 MT function downstream of IDH1/2 MT , TET2 MT AML cells served as a negative control and showed no sensitization neither.Although IDH1/2 MT greatly reduce the IDH1/2-mediated NADPH production capacity in AML cells ( P < 0.0001), IDH1/2 are not important NADPH providers in myeloid cells and the contribution of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) to the total NADPH production pool is much larger (maximal G6PD activity is ~4 times higher than maximal IDH1/2 activity, Fig. 1 ). This contrasts the situation in glioblastoma, where IDH1/2 provide 65% of all NADPH. Large-scale mRNA-sequencing in AML and glio(blasto)ma datasets revealed no differences in IDH1/2 and G6PD expression between types of cancer, suggesting that post-translational modifications perform key roles in regulating the maximal activity of these enzymes ( Fig. 2 ). To investigate the implications of these results on cellular redox potentials, we performed ROS measurements after treatment with irradiation and observed that IDH1/2 MT do not increase ROS in AML cells, whereas IDH1/2 MT do increase ROS in glioma cells. Discussion: Increased sensitivity to oxidative stress is not a metabolic vulnerability in IDH1/2 MT AML and this is likely due to the fact that maximal NADPH production capacity is affected to only a small extent in IDH1/2 MT AML. Therapies that increase oxidative stress, such as irradiation and metformin, counteract with IDH1/2 MT inhibitors in glio(blasto)ma cells because there, IDH1/2 MT have profound implications on cellular NADPH production capacities and ROS levels. Our results suggest that IDH1/2 MT do not induce sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs in AML cells and thatIDH1/2 MT inhibitors can be safely used adjuvantly to the AML standard of care daunorubicin and cytarabine, or whole-body irradiation in the context of bone marrow transplantations. These data are crucial for phase II and III clinical trial designs ofIDH1/2 MT inhibitors.
