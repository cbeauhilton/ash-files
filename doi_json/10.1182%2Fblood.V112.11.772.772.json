    "abstract_text": "The addition of Rituximab (R) to front-line combination chemotherapy has substantially improved the long term perspectives of patients with advanced stage follicular lymphoma (FL) resulting in median progression free survival (PFS) times of more than 36 months. In this situation the potential role of myeloablative herapy with subsequent autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in 1st remission needs to be critically reassessed. For this purpose two consecutive studies of the GLSG were analyzed both randomizing in 1 st remission for Interferon alpha (IFN) maintenance therapy versus ASCT. In the GLSG trial \u201896 initial therapy comprised a randomized comparison of CHOP versus Mitoxantrone, Chlorambucil and Prednisone (MCP) (total patient number 312) while in GLSG study \u201800 CHOP was randomly compared to R-CHOP (total patient number 268). Hence, both studies had an identical treatment arm of CHOP followed by either IFN maintenance or ASCT. In both studies, the identical treatments revealed superimposable results with a 5 years PFS of 27% after CHOP and IFN maintenance and 66% after CHOP followed by ASCT. Taking these data as internal control R-CHOP followed by IFN maintenance achieved a 5 year PFS of 67% which is hence comparable to CHOP followed by ASCT. R-CHOP followed by ASCT, however, revealed a 5 year PFS of 79% with only one relapse after 24 months.
