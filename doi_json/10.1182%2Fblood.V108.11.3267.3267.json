    "abstract_text": "T-bodies that combine the antigen recognition capability of single chain antibody molecules (scFv) with the signal transduction domains of activating receptors can be used to generate T cells with novel, engineered specificities independent of their endogenous TCR. We have developed a series of T-bodies with specificity towards CD19, a molecule with expression that appears restricted to normal and malignant B cells. These T-bodies contain the activating signals from the costimulatory T cell receptors, CD28 and/or 4-1BB, in tandem with the TCR-\u03b6 signal transduction domain. Using lentiviral gene transfer and T cells expansion via bead-immobilized anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, we can generate T cells 95% of which express the T-bodies. Lentiviral transduction combined with this efficient T cell expansion system has the potential to produce >10 11 antigen-specific T cells without the need for a cell selection step. Interestingly, we have noted significant constitutive signaling effects of T-body overexpression on transduced T cells that may been overlooked previously due to lower transduction efficiency. Despite the observed constitutive effects, we show that lentiviral-engineered T cells expressing anti-CD19 T bodies efficiently kill CD19 expressing cell lines and primary B-ALL cells in an antigen-specific manner. T-body engineered T cells also produce cytokines in response to antigen triggering with different patterns of cytokine production by T cells engineered with different T-bodies. In particular, a T-body receptor containing the 4-1BB signal transduction domain combined with the TCR-\u03b6 domain stimulates a >6-fold increase in IL-6 production compared with other receptor combinations in CD4+ T cells. In contrast, a CD28 and TCR-\u03b6 domain containing T body uniquely enhances IL-2 (>3-fold) and TNF-\u03b1 (> 7-fold) secretion by CD8+ T cells. These results indicate that the functional characteristics of our tested T-body signaling constructs are distinct and depend upon the particular receptor and T cell subset combination. We are also comparing the anti-tumor response generated by adoptively transferred T-body engineered T cells in leukemia bearing immunodeficient mice as a pre-clinical, therapeutic model. In addition to elucidating important functional differences of our lentiviral constructs, these studies indicate that an important variable in clinical trials will be optimizing the cytosolic signaling domain for the desired T cell subset. The present results suggest that distinct combinatorial signaling domains may be required for optimal function in CD4 and CD8 engineered T cells.",
