    "abstract_text": "Signals from the B-cell receptor are inappropriately activated in B-cell malignancies, including Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In CLL, 90% of patients respond to treatment with ibrutinib, an inhibitor of Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), with a mean three-year progression free survival rate of approximately 60%. Despite these promising numbers, patients who do not initially respond to ibrutinib have extremely poor outcomes, and nearly all patients eventually become resistant to ibrutinib due to mutations in BTK and its downstream effector Phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCG2), with a median survival time of 23 months. In order to identify salvage therapies for ibrutinib-resistant patients, we employed several quantitative proteomic methods to identify signaling pathways and proteins that are essential in ibrutinib-resistant patient cells and cell lines. Total proteomic analysis of lymphoma cell lines selected with ibrutinib in vitro revealed that multiple mitochondrial proteins are increased in B cells exposed to ibrutinib. Next, we found that ibrutinib-treated B cells also exhibited increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), which potently inhibit several protein phosphatases, including B cell receptor signaling regulators PTPN6 and INPP5D. We next looked at tyrosine phosphorylation in patient B cells collected at several time points during ibrutinib treatment and found decreased phosphorylation of both PTPN6 (Y536) and INPP5D (Y944 and Y865) during treatment. Furthermore, total levels of PTPN6 are decreased in patients within 3 months of initiating treatment, and disruption of PTPN6 in cell lines by CRISPR provided a selective advantage in ibrutinib-treated cell populations. Finally, we found that ibrutinib-treated and ibrutinib-na\u00efve primary CLL cells are sensitive to compounds that prevent reactive oxygen species generation (SOD and PHOX inhibitors). Combined, we propose a mechanism by which ibrutinib treatment leads to increased levels of ROS and decreased phosphatase activity, ultimately leading to a growth advantage in the presence of ibrutinib without concomitant mutations in PLCG2 and BTK. We hypothesize that targeting proteins important for reactive oxygen species generation would also be useful in patients and could result in regained disease control and/or prevention of acquired resistance.
