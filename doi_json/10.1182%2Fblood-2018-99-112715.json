    "abstract_text": "Background: As our healthcare system faces increasing complexity, it is important for all healthcare providers to practice at the full scope of their training. However, there are limited current options for subspecialty training in hematology for advanced practice providers (APPs), a group of health care providers including both nurse practitioners and physician assistants. We are unaware of any existing postgraduate fellowship for APPs focused on education in both malignant and nonmalignant hematologic disorders. We hope that by creation of the first such fellowship, we can better prepare APP graduates with the subspecialty-specific knowledge required to become highly skilled and competent clinicians in hematology. Methods: Using surveyhero.com, we conducted a web-based needs assessment survey which was distributed to 68 APPs currently working in the hematology and blood & marrow transplant (BMT) teams at three Mayo Clinic sites (Rochester, Scottsdale, and Jacksonville). This survey included questions regarding hematology-specific education the respondents had received in their APP schools, as a way to assess participant's perceptions about the readiness to practice in hematology after completion of APP education, and to identify the learning/training needs that are most important for APPs to practice in hematology. Results: Of 68 APPs, 49 (72%; 34 NPs,15 PAs) completed the survey. 57% of respondents were new APP graduates when hired and 35% had no prior work experience in hematology/BMT. All APPs held a Master's or higher degree (doctorate 31%). Thirty-nine (80%) reported <5% of their APP school curriculum was hematology-focused. The majority (92%) felt that the level of subspecialty training they received in APP schools did not adequately prepare them with the full confidence to practice in hematology. Forty-four (90%) APPs believed subspecialty training could help them to become more competent providers for patients with hematologic disorders. Forty-seven (96%) APPs agreed that being confident and knowledgeable in their practice positively impacted their job satisfaction, and most APPs (84%) felt structured hematology training would attract them to stay within the specialty. The educational subjects that APPs identified as most important included variety of malignant and benign hematologic disorders as well as hematopathology, bone marrow transplant, palliative care, transfusion medicine, infectious disease and pharmacology related to hematology practice. The top three effective learning strategies reported by the APP respondents were active learning from direct patient care, cased based teaching, and educational experience during hospital rounds. Conclusions and Discussions: This needs-based assessment educational project revealed to us the significant gaps in subspecialty training of APP education in hematology and confirmed the necessity of this fellowship. The findings of the survey helped us to optimize the fellowship curriculum in order to meet the learning needs of future APP trainees. Development of the subspecialty fellowship program is a step forward in the future training of APPs. We believe our fellowship has the potential to serve as the postgraduate training model for other institutions nationwide. Disclosures Lacy: Celgene: Research Funding.",
