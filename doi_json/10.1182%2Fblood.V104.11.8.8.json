    "abstract_text": "Methods: In the Nordic Lymphoma Group MCL Project newly diagnosed stage II-IV MCL patients < 66 years receive induction treatment and peripheral-blood stem-cell (PBSC) harvest, followed by BEAM/BEAC with PBSC support. In the MCL1 Protocol, the induction was maxi-CHOP x 3 (CTX 1200 mg/m 2 , doxorubicin 75 mg/m 2 , VCR 2mg D1, prednisolone 100 mg D1-5). Stem-cells were mobilised by maxi-CHOP + G-CSF. Because of the high failure rate in MCL1 (Figure 1) the MCL2 protocol was activated adding 2 series of high-dose Ara-C (3g/m 2 BID D1-2) and 2 standard doses of rituximab (R) (375 mg/m 2 ) to the induction program. Stem cells were mobilised by Ara-C + G-CSF + rituximab D1 + D9 for in-vivo purging. In both protocols patient-specific molecular markers were sought established before treatment start, and stem-cells and follow-up blood and bone-marrow samples assessed for MCL by PCR or flow cytometry.

So far, isolated molecular relapse occurred in 11 pts. of whom 10 received R: Four became PCR neg., one did not respond and later relapsed, five are not yet evaluable.
