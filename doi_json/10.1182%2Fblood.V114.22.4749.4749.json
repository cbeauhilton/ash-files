    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4749 To compare the cytotoxicity of NK cells on RPMI-8266 multiple myeloma cells before and after thermotherapy, and to explore its mechanism. MethodF RPMI-8226 cell was heated for 2 hours at 42\u00b0C and after continous culturing for 48 hours, remove dead cells at lower-speed centrifugation. Detected cytotoxicity of NK cells against RPMI-8226 cells, combinig with or without thermotherapy, by LDH releasing assay at different effect-to-target cell ratios (E:T). Moreover compare the expression of HLA class I molecules and NKG2D ligands-MHC class I chain-related molecule A or B and human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein UL16 binding proteins, ULBPsFULBP1AULBP2AULBP3 on the surface of RPMI 8226 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Result As for E:T is 5:1, the cytotoxicity of NK cells combining with or without hyperthermia on the 8266 NK cells are (2.15 \u00b1 0.32)% and (9.32 \u00b1 1.27)% respectively; at E:T(10:1), cytotoxicities are (5.26 \u00b1 0.84 )% and (20.37 \u00b1 1.78)%; at E:T (20:1), they are(7.63 \u00b1 1.05)% and (28.69 \u00b1 2.25)%;at ET(40:1), they are (10. 18 \u00b1 1.53)% and (35.64 \u00b1 4.87)%. At the different target ratio, the cytotoxcity of NK cells combining with or without thermotherapy were significant statistical difference (P  0.05). Conclusion Hyperthermia can enhance cytotoxicity of NK cells on multiple myeloma RPMI-8266 cells through upregulating the expression of NKG2D ligand ULBP1 and ULBP3 molecule on RPMI-8266, while no effect on HLA \u00b1 molecules.
