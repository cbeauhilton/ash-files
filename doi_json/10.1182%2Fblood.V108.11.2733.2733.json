    "abstract_text": "SGN-30 is a monoclonal antibody directed against the CD30 antigen, a member of the TNF receptor super-family. It has been evaluated in phase II clinical trials in patients with systemic Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL) and Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (HL). SGN-30 has shown good tolerability and objective tumor responses in patients with systemic ALCL. This multicenter, single arm phase II study, originally designed to evaluate the tolerability and activity of SGN-30 in patients with relapsed/refractory primary cutaneous ALCL (pcALCL), was expanded to include other symptomatic CD30-positive lymphoproliferative disorders: CD30+ Lymphomatoid Papulosis (LyP) or CD30+ Large Cell Transformation of Mycosis Fungoides (t-MF) without systemic involvement. Seventeen patients (14 male, 3 female) with median age of 63 years (range 33\u201379) have been enrolled. The median number of prior therapies was 3 (range 1\u20134). All patients had received at least 1 prior systemic therapy. SGN-30 was administered at a dose of 12 mg/kg by 2-hour infusion every 2\u20133 weeks. Up to 3 cycles (each comprised of 6 doses of SGN-30) were given. Evaluation of response was determined by Physician\u2019s Global Assessment (PGA) which was performed 2\u20133 weeks after each infusion. The best response assessment per indication is shown below: One Grade 3 pruritis and one Grade 3 increase in the number of neoplastic lesions were reported; both were considered to be unlikely related to SGN-30. There was one SAE in which an 80 year-old male died from complications of pneumonia, MI and aortic stenosis. This SAE was considered unrelated to the study drug. Preliminary data from this phase II study indicates that SGN-30 is well tolerated and demonstrates clinical antitumor activity.  Lymphoproliferative Disorders . CR . PR . SD . PD .
