    "abstract_text": "Early immune disorders, including preengraftment syndrome (PES)and acute graft-versus-host disease(aGvHD)are problematic in cord blood transplantation (CBT), and optimal prophylaxis has not been established. Here, we prospectively investigated whether intensive GvHD prophylaxis by adding low-dose methotrexate (MTX)at day 3 after CBThas a prognostic impact on CBT. 16 consecutive single-unit CBT recipients treated for high-risk hematologic malignancies (10 cases) and non-malignancies (6 cases) between February 2019 and March 2019. The patients, 6 female and 10 males, had a median age of 9 years (range 4-40) and a median weight of 26 kg (range 14-68). Myeloablative preparative regimen comprised fludarabine, busulfan and cyclophosphamide for malignancies and reduced-intensity-conditioning comprised fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation (4 Gy) for non-malignancies. Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis was cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil plus MTX 3 mg/m2 on day+3. 14 patients achieved engraftment at a median of day 19 and had more than 95% (complete) donor chimerism on day+14.Two patients without hematopoietic reconstitution were engrafted after a second CBT. PES was characterized by high-grade fever, rash, pulmonary edema, weight gain, liver and renal dysfunction developed on a median of day 8 in 11 of the 16 evaluable patients, including 2 who did not achieve engraftment. The PES patients received intravenous corticosteroid at a median dose of 1 mg/kg/day, and of these, 2 patients were requiredBasiliximab to improve clinical symptoms. Grade I to IV and aGvHD developed in 4 and only 1 patient developed severe aGvHD with Grade \u2162. Follow-up so far, one death occurred at day 103 because of pneumonia. 15 patients are alive well at a median follow-up of 135 days (131-163). Adding low-dose MTX at day +3 may be offer one optimal regimen to reduce severe early immune reactions and improve outcomes in CBT. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
