The use of Antithymocyte globuline (ATG) has reduced the incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD), particularly in its chronic form, but the impact of this approach on the prevention of lung dysfunction is not well characterized. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of pulmonary function in all patients transplanted from January 2001 through December 2005 following conditioning with oral busulfan (BU) followed by either cyclophosphamide (CY) or fludarabine (FLU) with or without the addition of ATG. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were performed per transplant protocol before and around day 80 and 1 year after transplantation. Results Of 406 patients, 13 (3%) were excluded due to lack of pre-transplant PFTs. Seventy five patients received ATG (thymoglobulin, given on days -3 to -1 for total doses of 4.5 \u2013 6 mg/kg), and 318 did not. The median patient age was 49 years for both the ATG (range 9-65) and non-ATG (range 7-66) groups; the median follow-up was 956 (range 19-2071) days and 903 (range 8-2697) days, respectively. The ATG group had proportionally more patients with high risk diseases (62.7% vs 45.7%, p= .03), whereas the use of bone marrow as stem cell source was higher in the non-ATG group (14.6% vs 5.3%, p=.03). The proportion of patients with PFTs at 1 year was similar for both groups (49.3% vs 54.6%, p=.55). No significant statistical differences between the 2 groups were seen in the mean percentage of the predicted values for FEV1, FVC, TLC and DLco at 80 days or 1 year after transplantation. The mean value of FEV1/FVC ratio at 1 year was higher for ATG patients (0.81\u00b10.05 vs 0.77\u00b10.09, p=.003). The mean change in PFT parameters from baseline to 1 year after HSCT also did not show a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for any PFT parameters except for the FEV1/FVC ratio, which decline was lower in the ATG group (0.4\u00b13.9 vs -2.8\u00b17.3 p=.0002). This difference remained significant in multivariate analysis. The lung function score at 1 year after transplantation was similar in the 2 groups; they also had similar rates of lung function decline (expressed as the annualized rate of FEV1 decline) from baseline to 1 year after HSCT. The risk of developing severe airflow obstruction (AFO) or a restrictive pattern (RP), as well as the cumulative incidence of AFO and RP were not statistically significantly different between the 2 treatment groups at 1 year after HSCT. Conclusions In this retrospective analysis, incorporation of ATG into the HSCT conditioning regimen did not appear to be associated with superior outcome in terms of post transplant pulmonary function. However, further evaluations are needed to better clarify the role that ATG might have in the development of late-term pulmonary complications.
