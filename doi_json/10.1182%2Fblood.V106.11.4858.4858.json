    "abstract_text": "44 patients of CML (in chronic phase) were evaluated for their hematological, cytogenetic and molecular response (by doing quantitative PCR- for bcr-abl/abl), over a period of last 4 years. The toxicity profile of these patients was also evaluated. The mean age of study group was 54.5 years, with a male: female ratio of 1.8:1 (28 males and 16 females). 13/44 (29.3%) patients were treated with interferon prior to imatinib therapy, while the rest (31) were started on imatinib (400mg/day) upfront. 43/44 (97.7%) patients achieved a complete hematological response. 1 patient who did not respond to imatinib therapy had long duration of disease (111 months). 24/44 (54.6%) had complete cytogenetic response, 4 (9.1%) had major and 5 (11.3%) had minor cytogenetic response. 7/44 (15.9%) had hematological relapse while on Imatinib therapy. 3/44 (6.8%) had cytogenetics / molecular relapse only. Out of the 13 patients who had received prior interferon, 4 developed hematological relapse and of these 4 patients, 1 developed blast crisis and other 3 are in accelerated phase. 3/31 (9.7%) patients who received imatinib therapy upfront developed hematological relapse, while 6/31 (19.2%) developed cytogenetic/molecular relapse including the 3 patients who developed hematological relapse. A median of 17 months of imatinib therapy was given in patients who did not receive prior interferon. 36/44 (81%) developed hypopigmentation 19/44 (43%) had fluid retention, 9/44 (20%) had muscle cramps and 3/44 (6.8%) developed myelosupression. The relapse rate in patients of CML in chronic phase is more in those who have received interferon prior to imatinib therapy (37.7%). At a median follow up of 17 months the relapse rate in patients who received imatinib de novo was 19.2%."
