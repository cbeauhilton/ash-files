    "abstract_text": "Background : Clinical trial evidence has demonstrated greater anemia-related fatigue at lower hemoglobin (Hb) levels in ESA-treated patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA). To understand these patient-reported outcomes (PROs), during ESA treatment in a real-world setting, data were analyzed from the Dosing and Outcomes Study of Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Therapies (D.O.S.E.) Registry, an ongoing, prospective, observational study. Methods : Patients included for analysis were required to have a baseline Hb prior to ESA administration and at least two ESA administrations. PROs were measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: Fatigue subscale (FACT-F), a 13-question measure of anemia-associated fatigue with lower scores indicating greater fatigue in patients with CIA. Patients were to have completed up to three FACT-F questionnaires within seven days of a post-baseline Hb level. If multiple Hb values were identified, the Hb value closest to the FACT-F assessment was reported. The association between FACT-F scores and Hb levels was tested in a repeated-measures analysis. Mean FACT-F scores were calculated for specified Hb ranges. Results : 740 CIA patients from 63 sites were identified between 12/03 and 7/08. 1088 concurrent FACT-F and Hb level assessments were available during ESA treatment. Mean FACT-F scores were lower when patients had lower Hb levels (table). The association between FACT-F scores and Hb levels showed a significant positive trend (p<.0001).

These findings are consistent with clinical trial evidence and provide observational PRO data to patients and providers regarding anemia-related fatigue during ESA treatment.",
