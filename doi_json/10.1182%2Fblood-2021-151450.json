    "abstract_text": "Background: Evans syndrome (ES) is a rare disorder defined as the simultaneous or sequential presence of autoimmune haemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia but it can also be considered as the presence of at least two autoimmune cytopenias. Recent reports have shown that ES is often a manifestation of an underlying congenital immune dysregulation syndrome that, in some case, can benefit from specific treatments. Aims: The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical/immnunological characteristics and the underlying genetic background of a single centre cohort of patients with ES. Methods: Data were obtained from a retrospective charts' review of patients with a diagnosis of ES in our centre. Genetic studies were performed with NGS analysis of 315 genes related to both hematologic and immunological disorders as congenital bone marrow failure syndromes, primary immunodeficiencies, and primary immune regulatory disorders. Results: Fourteen patients (23 males, 17 females) with a median age at onset of 6 years (range 0-16) were studied. ES was concomitant and sequential in 18 (45%) and 22 (55%) patients, respectively. Nine/40 (8%) patients had a family history of autoimmunity. Other abnormal immunological features and signs of lymphoproliferation were present in 24/40 (60%) and 29/40 (72%) of cases, respectively. Seventeen out of 40 (42%) children fitted the ALPS diagnostic criteria. The remaining 15 (37%) and 9 (22%) were classified as having an ALPS-like phenotype and an isolated ES, respectively. Twenty patients (50%) were found to have an underlying genetic defect on TNFRSF13B, FAS, CTLA4, IKBGK, CARD11, LIG4, LRBA, STAT3, CASP10 and ADA2 genes. Table 1 shows the details of clinical/immunological characteristics of patients with or without a genetic diagnosis. No significant differences were noted between the two groups. Conclusions: This study shows that half of patients with ES have a genetic background, secondary to Primary Immunodeficiencies. Therefore, an immunological screening and an extended molecular evaluation should be offered to all patients, since specific genetic diagnosis may benefit from targeted treatments.
