    "abstract_text": "Background: The initial report of the CREST phase 2 study ( Br J Haematol  2004 ; 127 : 165 \u201372 ) demonstrated the substantial activity of bortezomib (VELCADE\u00ae, Vc) at two different dose levels in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Here, we provide an updated analysis of overall survival (OS) after prolonged follow-up (median >5 years). Methods: 54 patients were enrolled to receive Vc 1.0 mg/m 2 (n=28) or 1.3 mg/m 2 (n=26) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle, for up to 8 cycles. Dexamethasone (dex) 20 mg on the day of and day after each Vc dose was added for 16 (57%) patients in the 1.0 mg/m 2 group and 12 (46%) patients in the 1.3 mg/m 2 group, upon suboptimal response to Vc alone. A total of 17 (31%) patients continued to receive Vc \u00b1 dex in an extension study, 12 (43%) from the 1.0 mg/m 2 and 5 (19%) from the 1.3 mg/m 2 groups. Patients received a median of 3 (range, 1\u20137) prior regimens. Median time from diagnosis to first Vc dose was 2 years. In the 1.0 and 1.3 mg/m 2 groups, respectively, mean age was 64 vs 60 years, 50% vs 35% of patients were male, 54% vs 65% had IgG MM, 58% vs 48% had \u03b2 2 -microglobulin \u22654 mg/L, and 29% vs 48% had abnormal cytogenetics. Response rate (CR+PR, EBMT criteria) to Vc alone was 30% vs 38%, and to Vc \u00b1 dex was 37% vs 50% in the 1.0 and 1.3 mg/m 2 groups. OS from first dose of Vc in each dose group was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Median OS in the 1.0 and 1.3 mg/m 2 groups was 26.8 months and 60.0 months, after median follow-up of 61 and 65 months, respectively (Figure). In the 1.0 mg/m 2 group, 21 (75%) patients have died; the 1- and 2-year OS rates were 82% and 54%, respectively. In the 1.3 mg/m 2 group, only 14/26 (54%) patients have died; 1- and 2-year OS rates were 81% and 69%, respectively. Conclusions: Vc \u00b1 dex was active in relapsed or refractory MM at both the 1.0 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 dose levels and was associated with notable OS, particularly in patients treated with the approved Vc dose of 1.3 mg/m 2 . The difference in OS between dose groups suggests that the higher dose of Vc is more active. Figure. Kaplan-Meier analyses of OS in patients who received Vc 1.0 mg/m 2 (n=28) or 1.3 mg/m 2 (n=26).
