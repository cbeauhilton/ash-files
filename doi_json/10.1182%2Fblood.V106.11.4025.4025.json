    "abstract_text": "Reference ranges (RRs) in coagulation are applicable only to specific analyser and reagent combinations and frequently need to be re-established if any of these are changed. In no other sphere of clinical laboratory practice are RRs more affected by such a wide range of multiple demographic and pre-analytical variables. For most routine clinical laboratories therefore, the collection of multiple, separate RRs is not feasible so a representative group of healthy adults such as laboratory staff frequently constitute the reference population from which these limits are calculated. Early morning venous samples were collected into glass B-D Vacutainers (Ref: 367691) from 221 healthy laboratory personnel (F= 159; M = 62) aged 20\u201363 yrs for both gender. Age groups were equally represented. Samples were processed on a Sysmex CA-1500 analyser within 1 hour of collection. Appropriate NCCLS guidelines were followed throughout. Reagents employed were - Actin FSL (APTT); Innovin (PT); Dade-Behring reference, calibration and deficient plasmas (factor assays); Dade-Behring kit ref: OWWR15 (ATIII); Chromogenix kit ref: 82209863 (Protein C). Outliers were excluded, data examined for normal distribution from histograms and significance levels calculated from the Anderson - Darling test of normality. RRs for normally distributed parameters were calculated using means \u00b1 2SDs. RRs for non-normally distributed parameters were calculated using the log natural transformation and the antilog of 2.5- and 97.5- percentiles. Italicised parameters shown below are non-normally distributed.  Parameter . Reference Range . Anderson Darling P-Value P-value for normal distribution .

Significant differences (p=0.014) in factor VIIIc was found between those of blood group O and non group O. Significant correlation was found between declining APTTs and associated increasing factor VIIIc when measured in individual volunteers.",
