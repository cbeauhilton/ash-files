    "abstract_text": "Background In multiple myeloma (MM), the introduction of novel compounds into first-line intensive treatment pathways has clearly improved patients\u2019 prognosis. Very recently however, specific molecular cytogenetic abnormalities, lactate dehydrogenase elevation and International Staging System 3 disease were identified to be associated with dismal prognosis despite upfront autologous (auto) stem cell transplant (SCT). Consolidative allogeneic (allo) following initial auto SCT was shown to extend progression-free survival (PFS) as well as overall survival (OS) in some prospective studies on newly diagnosed MM patients (pts). Relatively little is known on the impact of cytogenetic features other than chromosome 13q deletion (del13q) on the outcomes of pts undergoing upfront auto followed by allo (auto/allo) SCT. Patients and methods When the DSMM V treatment program was designed del13q detected by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was accepted as one of the distinct risk factors in MM. We therefore used FISH del13q to define the study\u2019s \u201chigh-risk\u201d group and aimed to compare tandem high-dose melphalan 200 mg/m\u00b2 (Mel) with one cycle of Mel followed by reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allo SCT. Allocation to either transplant regimen was by availability of an HLA-matched (at least 9/10 matches) related (MRD) or unrelated donor (MUD). Initially, all pts underwent non-novel compound cytoreduction and chemomobilization of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). RIC allo SCT was prepared by fludarabine and melphalan (plus ATG in MUD cases). PFS was the primary endpoint. The study was powered to detect an improvement of 2-year PFS from 20% (tandem Mel) to 40.3% (HR, 1.769). Results 199 out of 225 del13q pts with a median age of 53 (range, 30 \u2013 60) yrs who had been enrolled between 10/2001 and 03/2007, were included in the intent-to treat population. Allo SCT was performed in 126/199 pts (63%), 74 of whom (59%) received MUD allografts. At a median follow-up of 49.2 months (mo), 2-year PFS (calculated from day 1 of second SCT) was 59% with auto/allo SCT versus 47% with tandem Mel. Median PFS with auto/allo SCT was 34.5 mo versus 21.8 mo, respectively (p=.005). Two-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) associated with auto/allo SCT was 11.9%. As of yet, there is no difference in OS between the groups, with the median not yet reached for either transplant modality. PFS/OS in auto/allo SCT were independent of donor source (MRD vs MUD). As definitions of cytogenetic risk have evolved over time, we analyzed further FISH abnormalities in pts\u2019 baseline samples: in addition to uniform del13q, 13.6% of pts displayed del17p. Median PFS for del13q/del17p pts after HD Mel was 6 mo versus not reached with auto/allo SCT, respectively (p=.0002). Median OS in del13q/del17p after HD Mel was 23.4 mo versus not reached, respectively (p=.011). In translocation (4;14)/del13q pts (20.7%), median PFS with tandem Mel was 19.3 mo versus 19.1 with auto/allo SCT, respectively (p=.251). Conclusions This prospective trial shows auto/allo SCT to significantly extend PFS when compared to tandem HD Mel in a large cohort of del13q MM pts. It is the first study to demonstrate allo SCT in MM can be safely performed from matched unrelated donors at a reasonable rate of NRM. Utilizing a comprehensive set of FISH cytogenetics, our data for the first time demonstrate allo SCT to specifically benefit patients with high-risk features (del13q/del17p). Incremental gain of PFS when compared to tandem Mel was more than 20 months. Extended OS data on the whole study will be presented. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
