    "abstract_text": "In ARL, the addition of Rituximab (R) to CHOP chemotherapy may improve tumor response but the benefit may be offset by increased infectious deaths in patients with low CD4 cell counts ( Kaplan et al. Blood 2005 ; 106 : 1538 ). We hypothesized that R with EPOCH will improve tumor kill, allow fewer chemotherapy cycles and reduce toxicity. Patients received EPOCH-R (in mg/m 2 /d etoposide 50, vincristine 0.4 and doxorubicin 10 all CIV d 1\u20134; and in mg/m 2 cyclophosphamide 750 IV day 5, prednisone 60 po days 1\u20134 and rituximab 375 IV d 1, 5; and G-CSF sc d 6\u201315). Prophylactic IT MTX x 6 was administered and HAART was discontinued on all cycles. Cyclophosphamide was adjusted based on absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir. Response was assessed by CT and PET and patients received 1 cycle beyond CR for a minimum of 3 cycles. Characteristics of 30 enrolled patients: median (range) age 41 (9\u201361) years; IPI 3 (0\u20134); ECOG PS 1 (1\u20134), CD4 count 213 (0\u2013674) cells/mm 3 ; HIV viral load 55,900 (0\u20136,080,000) RNA copies/mL; male sex 25 (83%); LDH > N 22 (73%); stage IV 20 (67%) and histology DLBCL 26 (87%) and Burkitt lymphoma 4 (13%). Of 28 evaluable patients (2NE), median (range) cycles given is 3 (3\u20135) with CR/CRu in 25 (89%) and PR in 1 (3%) patients. All 4 patients with Burkitt lymphoma are in continuous remission. At 35 months median potential follow-up, PFS and OS are 80% and 65%, respectively. For patients with CD4 > and < 100 cells/mm 3 OS is 93% and 28%, respectively. IPI did not impact OS and PFS. We assessed the predictive value of early (after cycle 2 or 3) PET scanning on subsequent relapse. This was evaluated in 23 patients in follow-up. 0 of 13 patients with a negative PET study progressed (100% negative predictive value) whereas 2 of 10 patients with a positive PET progressed (20% positive predictive value). One death from MAI occurred on treatment and toxicity over 91 cycles of therapy included fever/neutropenia on 27 (30%), ANC < 500/mm 3 on 36 (40%), and platelets < 50,000 on 21 (23%) cycles. EPOCH-R was associated with less CD4 loss - median 128 cells/mm 3 (range +154 to \u2212639) compared to EPOCH alone (median 189 cells/mm 3 (range +19 to \u2212973)( Little et al. Blood 2003 ; 101 : 4653 ). Abbreviated EPOCH-R is highly effective with acceptable tolerability in ARL and enables the administration of fewer treatment cycles (median 3 versus 6). Patients with CD4 < 100/mm 3 have good tumor control with EPOCH-R with a PFS of 61% at 35 months, but survival continues to be limited by HIV-associated complications. In contrast, patients with high CD4 counts > 100/mm 3 have an extremely favorable outcome with EPOCH-R. Albeit limited data, EPOCH-R was effective in all 4 patients with Burkitt lymphoma. PET scanning has a high negative but low positive predictive value for subsequent relapse. Accrual continues.
