    "abstract_text": "Introduction : The primary objective of this phase II study was to assess the safety of different dose regimens of DU-176b, an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods : This was a randomized, parallel group, multicenter, multinational, double-blind DU-176b and open-label warfarin safety study in patients with AF (CHADS 2 index \u2265 2). Patients were randomly assigned to receive either one of four fixed dose regimens of DU-176b (30 mg qd, 30 mg bid, 60 mg qd or 60 mg bid) or warfarin dose-adjusted to a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0\u20133.0. for 12 weeks. Investigators, sponsor and study subjects were blinded to DU-176b dose but not to the identity of DU-176b vs. warfarin. Investigators adjusted warfarin doses based on INR values obtained in local laboratories. The INR was determined weekly for 4 weeks and every two weeks thereafter. The primary outcomes were the occurrence of centrally adjudicated major and/or clinically relevant non-major bleeding event, and elevated liver enzymes and/or bilirubin. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), a composite of stroke, systemic embolism, acute myocardial infarction, hospitalizations due to cardiovascular condition or cardiovascular death, as well as all other adverse events, including all bleeding events. Results : A total of 1,146 patients were randomized. There were no clinically relevant differences between treatment groups with respect to the demographic data and baseline characteristics. Mean age was 65\u00b18.7 years, 63.3% of patients had a CHADS 2 index of 2 and 64.40% were warfarin nai\u0308ve. The DU-176b 60 mg bid treatment arm was prematurely terminated during the study based on a recommendation by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). A total of 180 patients were randomized to this group at the time. The incidence of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events was significantly higher in both the DU-176b 60 mg bid and 30 mg bid groups than in those given warfarin. The incidence of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events in the DU-176b 30 mg qd and 60 mg qd groups was similar to that in warfarin-treated patients. The time in therapeutic range (TTR) for warfarin-experienced patients was 50.1% and for warfarin nai\u0308ve patients was 41.8%. There were no significant differences in the number (%) of subjects with persistently elevated ALT, AST, or bilirubin values across the treatment groups. The incidence of stroke was similar across treatment groups (Table).  . DU-176b 30 mg qd N=235 . DU-176b 60 mg qd N=234 . DU-176b 30 mg bid N=244 . DU-176b 60 mg bid N=180 . Warfarin qd N=250 .

Patients treated with the DU-176b 30 mg bid or 60 mg bid regimens had more bleeding events than occurred with warfarin. These results suggest that the DU-176b 30 mg qd or 60 mg qd regimens are safe and well tolerated. A Phase III trial is needed to determine whether DU-176b will provide a suitable replacement for warfarin in AF patients. CR, clinically relevant. a P <0.05, b P =0.002 to warfarin."
