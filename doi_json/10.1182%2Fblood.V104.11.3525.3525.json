    "abstract_text": "Over 30 years ago, Jamison and Barber proposed that externally disposed glycosyl transferase (GT) activity mediates platelet adhesion and other functions. Subsequent work ruled out ecto-GT activity in nucleated cells and established the Golgi as the site of such enzymes, although no further studies examined platelets. We recently reported a platelet-associated galactosyl transferase (\u03b24Gal-T) catalyzing galactose coupling in a \u03b21,4 linkage to exposed N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues on N-linked glycans of the GPIb\u03b1 subunit of the von Willebrand factor receptor complex. This activity, also present in plasma, mediates galactose transfer to GPIb\u03b1 following addition of UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) alone. Since galactosylation of GPIb\u03b1 prevents clearance of chilled platelets by liver macrophages after transfusion, sufficiently active endogenous endogenous \u03b24Gal-T could facilitate platelet cold storage after the mere addition of substrate UDP-Gal ( Science  301 : 1531 \u20131534, 2003 ). We now give evidence that human platelets contain a highly active (0.05 nmol/min) plasma membrane-associated ecto-\u03b24Gal-T with properties of an isoform designated as type 1 (\u03b24Gal-T1). A specific \u03b24Gal-T1 antibody immunoprecipitates \u03b24Gal-T1 activity from platelet lysates and the inhibition profile activity by \u03b1-lactalbumin and benzyl-\u03b2-D-GlcNAc are characteristic of \u03b24Gal-T1. \u03b24Gal-T1 has a transmembrane domain, and platelet \u03b24Gal-T, although releasable by non-ionic detergent, remains cell- and membrane associated despite extensive washing. The platelet enzyme incorporates UDP-[C14]Gal into a single polypeptide with the apparent Mr of GPIb\u03b1, identifying this protein as its unique endogenous target. Nevertheless, washed platelets are as active as recombinant \u03b24Gal-T1 in galactosylating exogenous substrates, benzyl-\u03b2-D-GlcNAc and ovalbumin. In conclusion, we have revived the concept of an ecto-glycosyl transferase on blood platelets and demonstrated that platelet \u03b24Gal-T is probably sufficiently active to accommodate reliable enzymatic conversion of platelets by simple addition of UDP-Gal.",
