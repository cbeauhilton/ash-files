    "abstract_text": "While well recognized as an autoantibody mediated disease, the pathophysiology of childhood ITP remains poorly understood. Approximately 20% of children diagnosed with acute ITP will have persistent thrombocytopenia for more than 6 months after the original diagnosis. One hypothesis is that the autoantibody coated platelets are bound by surface Fc\u03b3 receptors in the reticuloendothelium system, which then target these platelets for destruction. Although the Fc\u03b3RIIIA receptor usually shows weak binding, the phenylalanine (F) to valine (V) mutation in the Fc\u03b3RIIIA receptor results in a higher affinity for IgG1 and IgG3. To test the possibility that the Fc\u03b3RIIIA receptor genotype is associated with increased autoantibody mediated platelet destruction in ITP, we screened more than 80 ITP patients for this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) using an amplicon-down format for a custom Nanochip molecular biology workstation microarray assay. We observed a large shift in the allele frequencies of the Fc\u03b3RIIIA receptor SNP (F158V) in ITP patients compared to controls (F =.36, V =.64 vs F =.70, V =.30; P<.001). When we analyzed the ITP patients with regard to chronicity of ITP, we found that chronic ITP patients showed a larger V allele frequency shift (F =.45, V =.55) than acute ITP patients (F =.58, V =.42). The IL-1\u03b1-889 SNP genotypes of these ITP patients were also found to have allele frequencies significantly different from controls (C =.67, T =.33 vs C =.84, T =.16, P =.005).

Thromb. Haemost. 2005). Thus, we propose that the Fc\u03b3RIIIA receptor and IL-1\u03b1-889 genotypes may be useful as potential risk factors for ITP and its response to therapy. Understanding the mechanism whereby these polymorphisms alter the incidence and course of ITP in children will provide critical information in the prevention and treatment of this syndrome.",
