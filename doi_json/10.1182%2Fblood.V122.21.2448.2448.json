    "abstract_text": "Altered expression of Trib2 pseudokinase has been associated with AML (M2, M4 subtypes) ( Cancer Cell, 10: 401 ), and ectopic expression of Trib2 in hematopoietic progenitors drives myeloid leukemogenesis ( Blood, 116: 1321 ). In addition, inhibition of Trib2 expression by EPO in erythroid progenitors has been demonstrated ( Blood, 111: 5390 ). Beyond this, little is known about Trib2\u2019s expression profiles and roles during normal myelopoiesis. To critically address functional roles, we have generated and characterized a novel Trib2-KO mouse model. Within bone marrow CFU-GM formation faltered, and Trib2-KO Lin neg progenitors exhibited deficit granulocyte production (with a relative increase in monocytes). This was not associated with significant differences in survival or cell cycle features among developing granulomonocytic cells. Instead, Trib2 levels proved to be heightened among Lin neg progenitors (and inhibited in GM cells following GMCSF, GCSF or ATRA exposure). This prompted analyses of CMP and early-CMP (eCMP) populations in which RNAseq demonstrated peak Trib2 expression. Furthermore, eCMP and CMP pools were elevated in Trib2-KO mice. Within progenitors of the erythroid lineage, Trib2 expression levels also selectively increased, and in Trib2-KO mice BFUe and CFUe levels were decreased (and RBC plus HGB were diminished). Intriguingly, when Trib2-KO mice were challenged with Flt3L plus GMCSF, BFUe (but not CFU-GM or GEMM) were mobilized to peripheral blood at levels 13.3-fold above wild-type controls. This indicates candidate effects of Trib2 on a proposed BFUe niche. Overall, novel multi-lineage roles for Trib2 are revealed in regulating eCMP pools, GM-CSF populations, balanced granulocytic vs monocytic cell formation, and the production of erythroid progenitor cells.
