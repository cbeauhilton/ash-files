    "abstract_text": "Introduction Steroid refractory chronic graft-versus-host-disease (SR-cGVHD) is the leading cause of late morbidity and mortality in allogeneic transplant patients. Safety of extracorporeal photophoresis (ECP) has led to multiple studies evaluating its role in SR-cGVHD. Overall and organ specific response rates (RR) of SR-cGVHD have varied significantly between studies. We conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of ECP in SR-cGVHD. Methods A comprehensive search of several databases (Ovid Medline In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials,, Scopus) for articles published in any language between 1984-2012 was conducted. Unpublished studies using electronic databases from the annual meetings abstracts of hematology/transplant societies were searched. Experts in the field were also contacted for selection of studies and missing data from selected trials. End points included complete response rate (CR), overall RR (ORR), and organ-specific RR's. Results Initial search generated 312 studies, out of which 18 studies (4 prospective) met selection criteria (N=595). Random effects model was used for pooled rates. Pooled CR rate (11 studies) was 29% (CI 19%-42%). Pooled ORR (16 studies) was 64% (CI 65-82%). 1 year overall survival was 49% (CI 29-70%). There was significant heterogeneity between studies (I\u00b2=72) likely due to differences in ECP schedules utilized, and a variety of scales used to measure outcomes.\u00a0 Pooled RR's for SR-cGVHD of skin was 74% (CI 60-85%), liver was 68% (CI 57-77%), ocular was 60% (CI 40-78%), oral was 72% (CI 51-86%), lung was 48% (CI 33-63%), gastrointestinal (GI) was 53% (CI 21-83%), and musculoskeletal (MSK) was 64% (CI 18-94%). No significant differences in responses to ECP for pediatric and adult populations were found. Sensitivity analysis could not be done due to limited number of prospective studies. Conclusions ECP is an effective therapy for oral, skin & liver SR-cGVHD, with modest activity in lung and GI SR-cGVHD. Further studies must report standardized outcomes with a uniform schedule of ECP.
