    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5023 A direct effects of lenalidomide on gene expression in 5q- patients was studied using HumanRef-8 v2 Expression BeadChips (Illumina). Expression profiles of 6 patients (before treatment and at the time of the first erytroid response) and 6 healthy controls were investigated from CD14+ monocytes of peripheral blood. Differentially expressed genes were identified by Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM). Simultaneously, selected genes (TNF, JUN, IL1) were monitored in the course of treatment using Real-Time PCR with Taqman Gene Expression Assays. A comparison of gene expression levels before and during lenalidomide treatment revealed 97 differentially expressed genes (FC >2; p<0.05) related to following biological processes: immune response (16 genes), inflammatory response (11 genes), response to bacteria (8 genes), anti-apoptosis (7 genes), regulation of MAP kinase activity (5 genes), oxygen transport (4 genes), and regulation of cell proliferation (11 genes). An overexpression of a number of cytokines (e.g. TNF, IL8, IL1B, CCL3L, CXCL2, and TNFAIP3) was detected in patients before treatment, after lenalidomide administration expression of the majority of the up-regulated cytokine genes decreased to the control baseline level. Detected overproduction of the cytokines in 5q- syndrome may lead to an increased apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitor cells and together with excessive oxidative stress may contribute to the damage the hematopoietic niche. In the same manner, untreated patients showed suppressed expression of two genes (CXCR4, CRTAP) which play an important role in the stem cell niche. After treatment, we detected increased expression of these genes. Both the observations might explain favorable effects of lenalidomide on the bone marrow stroma defect seen in 5q- syndrome. On the other hand, a substantial increase of the ARPC1B gene (an activator and a substrate of Aurora A) expression was detected after lenalidomide treatment. Since overexpression of Aurora A leads to polyploidy and chromosomal instability, ARPC1B might play a role in the disease progression observed in some patients treated with lenalidomide. To conclude, described changes in genes expression may contribute to identification of the pathways affected by lenalidomide and to the explanation of some effects of this drug that have not been fully understood yet.
