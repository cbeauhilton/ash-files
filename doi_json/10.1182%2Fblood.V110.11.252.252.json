    "abstract_text": "Background: With the prolonged survival and increasing cure rate for some malignancies there appears to be an increasing incidence of therapy related MDS or AML. Methods: Between 1981 and 2006, 486 patients (pts) with t-MDS or t-AML underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and were reported to the EBMT registry. The median age of the pts was 40 years (r., 3\u201369) and primary disease were solid tumor (n=167), malignant lymphoma (n=141), myeloproliferative syndrome (n=12), acute leukaemia (n=32), aplastic anemia (n=16) and autoimmune disease (n=1). The median time from primary diagnosis to t-MDS/t-AML was 54 months (r., 1\u2013416). Diagnosis were: RA/RARS (n=28), RAEB (n=49), RAEB-T (n=44) and t-AML (n=308). At time of transplantation, 268 pts were in complete and 186 pts not in complete remission (CR). Cytogenetic abnormalities were found in 262 pts. Results: For the entire study population the cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse at 3 years was 37% and 34%. In a multivariate analysis significant factors for higher incidence of relapse were \u201cnon CR\u201d at SCT (HR:2.20; 95% CI: 1.44\u20133.36, p 50 years (HR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.36\u20132.78, p 50 years (HR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.47\u20133.08, p<0.001), \u201cnon CR\u201d at SCT (HR: 1.57; 95% CI 1.18\u20132.09; p<0.001) and disease status RAEB-T (HR:2.44; 95% CI: 1.27\u20134.66; p=0.007) and t-AML (HR: 2.26; 95% CI; 1.19\u20133.92, p=0.02). Conclusion: Allogeneic SCT can cure pts with therapy related MDS or AML. During study period a better EFS and OS could be seen per calendar year due to a marked reduction in non-relapse mortality. Advanced disease-status, abnormal cytogenetics and higher age of the pts are the most significant factors for survival.",
