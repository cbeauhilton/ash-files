    "abstract_text": "Despite advances in the treatment of leukemia patients, response rates with intensive chemotherapy regimens remain less than 30% for relapsed or refractory acute leukemias and advanced chronic myelogenous leukemias. SNS-595, is a novel naphthyridine analog small molecule, a class of drugs not previously used in cancer treatment. SNS-595 acts specifically during the S-phase of the cell cycle to induce rapid apoptosis of cells that are actively synthesizing DNA, and a subsequent cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is developing SNS-595 for the treatment of both solid and hematologic malignancies. SNS-595 was previously evaluated in two models of hematologic cancer in nu / nu mice, causing a dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition (97% to 99%, n=6 mice per treatment group) in a LM-3 Jck (human acute lymphoma) hematologic xenograft. All 6 mice treated at 30 mg/kg had a major reduction in tumor volume, with 2 mice showing a complete response. SNS-595 also significantly inhibited tumor growth in mice bearing CCRF-CEM (human acute lymphoblastic leukemia) xenograft tumors. In phase I clinical trials in solid tumors the dose-limiting toxicity was neutropenia, and the incidence of gastrointestinal effects, nausea, and vomiting was low. No mucositis or peripheral neuropathies were observed. In the present study, CD1 mice (n=4 per treatment group) were administered either SNS-595 15 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg, by IV bolus on days 0 and 4, or the S-phase acting drug, cytarabine (Ara-C) 150 mg/kg, BID, by IP injection on days 0 and 4. SNS-595 was well tolerated, with no body weight loss observed through to day 16. Bone marrow isolated from the femurs showed a dose-dependent reduction in cellularity on day 6, 48hr after the second of the two SNS-595 administrations; at 15 and 20 mg/kg, cellularity was reduced to 15% (\u00b12.9, n=4) and 7.5% (\u00b11.4, n=4) respectively. SNS-595, 20 mg/kg, reduced absolute neutrophils to a nadir of 51 \u00b124 cells/\u03bcL blood (n=4) on day 8, from 1244 \u00b155 cells/\u03bcL at day 0 (n=4), but subsequently rebounded to normal levels by day 16. Total WBCs also reached a nadir on day 8, returning to normal by day 16. In the same timeframe cytarabine caused bone marrow ablation, with absolute neutrophil counts substantially reduced at day 8 and returning to normal by day 16. In conclusion SNS-595 has significant anti-tumor activity in hematologic xenografts, as well as significant ability to reversibly ablate murine bone marrow cells. These properties, combined with the good clinical safety profile observed in phase I patients, suggest that SNS-595 has the potential to demonstrate anti-tumor activity in patients with hematologic malignancies.",
