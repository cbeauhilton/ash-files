    "abstract_text": "Background : Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are associated with thrombosis and pregnancy loss in patients with Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS). aPL and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) bind to and activate endothelial cells (EC) through NF\u03baB and p38 MAPK pathways. Recent studies suggest that aPL might interact with toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), the receptor for LPS. Aim : to investigate the role of TLR-4 in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Methods : we examined: i) the aPL effects on thrombosis and EC activation in LPS non-responsive (LPS\u2212/\u2212) mice that display a spontaneous mutation of TLR-4 vs LPS-responsive (LPS+/+) mice displaying wild type TLR-4, ii) the prevalence of TLR-4 Asp299gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms - both associated with decreased response to LPS - in 110 APS patients (with arterial and/or venous thrombosis) vs 220 controls (of same ethnic background). IgGs were purified from a patient with APS (IgG-APS) and from control serum (IgG-NHS). LPS \u2212/\u2212 and LPS +/+ mice, in groups of nine, were treated with IgG-APS or with IgG-NHS twice intraperitoneally. Size of induced thrombi and # of leukocyte (WBC) adhering to endothelial cells in the microcirculation of endothelium of the cremaster muscle of mice (as a means to measure endothelial cell activation) were determined in vivo, seventy-two hours after the first injection. TLR-4 Asp299gly & Thr399Ile polymorphisms were evaluated by Allele-Specific PCR. Results : LPS +/+ mice treated with IgG-APS produced significantly larger thrombi when compared to mice treated with IgG-NHS (2166 \u00b1 1419 \u03bcm 2 vs 1176 \u00b1 841 \u03bcm 2 ) and significantly larger number of WBC adherence to ECs (4.5 \u00b1 1.9 vs 2.2 \u00b11.1). Thrombus size and number of adhering WBC to ECs were significantly lower in LPS \u2212/\u2212 mice treated with IgG-APS compared to LPS +/+ mice treated with IgG-APS [thrombus size: 779 \u00b1 628 \u03bcm 2 vs 2166 \u00b1 1419 \u03bcm 2 (p<0.05) and number of adherent WBC to EC: 1.0 \u00b1 0.5 vs 4.5 1.9 (p<0.05)], respectively. The titer of anticardiolipin antibodies in the sera of mice injected with aPL was 48.2 \u00b1 17.1 GPL (for LPS \u2212/\u2212 mice) and 50.8 \u00b1 11.2 GPL (for LPS +/+ mice), respectively (NS). A significant reduction in TLR-4 Asp 299gly & Thr399Ile polymorphisms was observed in APS patients (5%) compared to controls (11.4%) (p<0.05). Conclusions : These findings strongly suggest that TLR-4 is involved in aPL interaction with endothelial cells and mediates their pathogenic effects.",
