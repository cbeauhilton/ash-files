    "abstract_text": "Background Thrombocytopenia (Tp) is frequently observed in individuals with advanced cirrhotic liver disease. Patients with HCV may develop Tp even in the absence of significant liver disease. Decreased thrombopoietin production may also contribute to the Tp. The current management of HCV infection includes the use of the Peg-interferon \u03b1 (IFN) and ribavirin (RIB), which can induce a sustained viral remission in 40 to 50% of treated patients. However, Peg-INF is a known inhibitor of megakaryocyte growth and maturation and can result in treatment related Tp. Therefore, patients presenting with platelet counts 100,000/mcl to allow for HCV treatment with Peg-INF/RIB. Methods This is a two phase clinical trial of HCV infected patients with Child-Pugh class A liver disease. All patients were required to have platelet counts 100,000/mcl before initiating Peg-INF treatment. There are separate 1 to 1 randomizations for patients with platelets 70 to 50,000/\u00b5l and patients with platelets100,000/\u00b5l by week 8, blind is terminated and placebo patients can enter the romiplostim arm. Phase II is a dose escalation study of romiplostim during Peg-INF/Rib treatment up to week 24 of HCV treatment. If patients are viral load negative by week 24, romiplostim treatment is held to see if the patients can sustain a safe platelet count with continued HCV therapy. If not, romiplostim is continued until completion of HCV treatment. A protocol amendment allowed the addition of HCV protease inhibitors for genotype 1a patients. Results At the time of this report 21 patients (7F/14M; mean age 54.9 yrs, range 28-72yrs) have been enrolled in this trial; 13 with platelets 70 to 50,000/\u00b5l (Mean 62,000/\u00b5l; range 55 to 70,000\u00b5l) and 8 with platelet counts100,000/ul by wk 8; all on placebo and were rolled over to romiplostim. The mean romiplostim dose for patients completing Phase I with platelets 70 to 50,000/\u00b5l was 2.2 mcg/kg and 3.1 mcg/kg for patients with platelets of<50,000/\u00b5l. During the 8 wk course of romiplostim there were no SAEs and no change in HCV viral load. Eleven patients have successfully completed Phase II with 24 wks of HCV treatment; with 4 patients on HCV treatment at wks 21, 20, 13 and 9. One patient was withdrawn at wk 14 due to intractable pancytopenia. 7/11 (64%) were HCV viral load negative at wk 24 and continued to completion of their HCV treatment. The mean romiplostim dose for the 11 patients completing Phase II with HCV treatment was 7\u00b5g/kg (3 to 10\u00b5g/kg). Three major SAEs occurred during Phase II. A 61 y.o. female developed pancytopenia at wk 14 unresponsive to growth factor support with a hypocellular bone marrow. She had a slow recovery of counts over several months. A 63 y.o. female developed portal vein thrombosis at wk 22 of HCV therapy. Her platelet count was 92,000/\u00b5l. She was treated with LMW heparin, continued HCV treatment with romiplostim off study and was viral load negative at wk 44 of treatment. A 50 y.o. female had a sudden death at home at wk 20 of HCV therapy. She has a platelet count of 32,000/\u00b5l on a clinic visit the day before her death and her romiplostim dose was 10\u00b5g/kg. No autopsy was performed. Conclusion In this interim analysis of ongoing clinical trial, romiplostim appears well tolerated and effective in increasing platelet counts in HCV cirrhotic patients and can maintain a safe platelet count in the majority of patients during HCV antiviral therapy with Peg-INF/RIB.
