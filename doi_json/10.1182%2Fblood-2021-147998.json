    "abstract_text": "Definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) emerge in the embryo and sustain major adult hematopoietic lineages. Although their functional potential is detected by transplant, nascent HSC contribution during development is both unknown and difficult to address due to the overlapping emergence of HSC-independent progenitors-cells that lack the multipotency and/or longevity of HSCs but express many of the same markers. Using sorted hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from zebrafish embryos, we performed single cell RNA sequencing to decipher HSC and HSC-independent progenitor heterogeneity during the time frame of their emergence and initial maturation. After batch correction and dimensional reduction, we identified seven distinct populations that are inferred from RNA velocity analysis to originate from pre-hemogenic endothelium and develop into three main differentiation trajectories. We also determined that HSCs can be distinguished from HSC-independent progenitors based on the temporal regulation and differential activity of the draculin ( drl ) promoter that was previously shown to mark adult-contributing HSCs. From these studies, we found that the drl promoter is active in HSCs and HSC-independent progenitors at 1-day post-fertilization (dpf) but becomes highly expressed primarily in HSCs by 2 dpf. We applied a drl:cre-ER T2 tamoxifen-inducible Cre-loxP lineage-tracing approach to selectively lineage trace HSCs starting at 2 dpf and track their myeloid and lymphoid contribution during larval development and adulthood. We determined that HSC-independent progenitors primarily contribute to developmental lymphomyelopoiesis with minimal HSC contribution until after 7 dpf. Consistent with this result, we demonstrated that although HSCs robustly regenerated after hematopoietic injury using a novel inducible larval HSC injury model, their depletion had almost no impact on lymphoid and myeloid cell numbers up to 7 dpf. These findings suggest that HSCs are not entirely dormant during development and that there exists an uncoupling of HSC self-renewal and differentiation in development. In conclusion, we determine that it is the HSC-independent progenitors, and not HSCs, that sustain embryonic and early larval lymphomyelopoiesis. Acquiring a greater understanding regarding developmental differences in progenitor and HSC specification and maturation will inform and improve the generation of functional HSCs from renewable pluripotent stem cells.
