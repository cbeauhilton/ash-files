    "abstract_text": "Background: Venetoclax (Ven; BH3 mimetic) and Obinutuzumab (O; CD20 antibody) is an approved, fixed-duration regimen (one year) that induces undetectable minimum residual disease (uMRD) and durable remissions in treatment na\u00efve patients (pts) with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; Fischer NEJM 2019). In the CLARITY trial of venetoclax-ibrutinib (BTK inhibitor; BTKi) in relapsed or refractory CLL, peripheral blood (PB) MRD response kinetics predicted bone marrow (BM) uMRD and were associated with progression-free survival (Rawstron EHA 2020). We explored MRD as a biomarker to direct treatment duration in an investigator-initiated phase 2 trial of Zanubrutinib (BTKi) and O-Ven (BOVen). We hypothesize that early MRD kinetics will identify a defined cohort of pts with delayed BM MRD clearance, and early recurrent detectable MRD after discontinuation of treatment in pts attaining uMRD. Methods: In this multicenter, phase 2 trial (NCT03824483), eligible pts had previously untreated CLL requiring treatment (iwCLL), ECOG PS \u22642, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u22651,000/ul, platelets (PLT) \u226575,000/ul (ANC \u22650/ul, PLT \u226520,000/ul if due to CLL). Informed consent was obtained from all pts. BOVen was administered in 28-day (D) cycles (C): Zanubrutinib 160 mg by mouth (PO) twice daily starting D1; Obinutuzumab 1000 mg IV D1 (split D1-2 if lymphocyte count \u226525,000/ul or lymph node \u22655cm), D8, D15 of C1, and D1 of C2-8; Venetoclax ramp up initiated C3D1 (target 400 mg PO daily). MRD was evaluated by flow cytometry (MRD-FC) and immunosequencing (MRD-IS; Adaptive ClonoSEQ) with uMRD defined as \u226410 -4 for flow and \u226410 -5 for IS. Treatment consisted of 8-24 cycles with duration determined by prespecified MRD criteria. Beginning on C7D1 then every 2 cycles, pts with PB uMRD-FC had BM within 14 days. If BM uMRD, PB MRD was repeated after two additional cycles. Pts with confirmed uMRD-FC in PB and BM discontinued therapy and entered posttreatment surveillance. Response was assessed per iwCLL. Adverse events (AE) were assessed per CTCAE v5. MRD-IS failure free survival (FFS) was calculated from end-of-treatment (EOT) to the date of detectable MRD-IS (\u226510 -5 ) using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The study accrued 39 pts (03/19-10/19): median age 59 years (23-73), 3:1 male predominance, 28/39 (72%) IGHV unmutated, 5/39 (12.8%) del(17p)/ TP53 M. All pts were evaluable for toxicity with 37 evaluable for efficacy. At a median follow up of 26+ months (mo; 4.5-30.5+), 95% (35/37) pts achieved uMRD-FC in PB, among whom 33 (94%) also achieved uMRD-IS. BM uMRD-FC was seen in 89% (33/37) at a median time of 8 mo (6-16), all of whom met prespecified MRD criteria and discontinued therapy after a median of 10 mo (8-18). Three pts discontinued therapy with persistent detectable BM MRD after 24 cycles. The most common AEs were neutropenia (51%), thrombocytopenia (44%), diarrhea (44%), infusion related reaction (41%) and bruising (41%). The most common grade \u22653 AE was neutropenia (15%). No laboratory or clinical TLS occurred (Howard definition). A \u2265400-fold reduction in PB MRD-IS after 4 cycles (\u0394MRD400) was selected using the Youden Index and was highly predictive of attaining BM uMRD in \u22648mo (sensitivity 88% [21/24], specificity 100% [11/11], PPV 100% [21/21], NPV 79% [11/14]. As a result, the median duration of therapy was shorter among patients who achieved \u0394MRD400 (8 vs 13 mo). Of 33 pts who met prespecified uMRD criteria and stopped therapy, 31 (94%) remain uMRD-FC following a median 15 mo (0-20) from EOT, and 2 pts had recurrent MRD (1 with PD recaptured PB uMRD with retreatment). Of 33 pts who discontinued therapy after achieving the prespecified MRD endpoint, MRD-IS was evaluated every 3 months in 31 pts for a median of 12 mo (range, 3-18) from EOT. MRD-IS FFS was longer in pts who achieved \u0394MRD400 (log rank p<0.001; Figure) despite shorter treatment duration. We did not observe differences in posttreatment MRD kinetics based on IGHV status or high-risk genetics. Conclusion: BOVen achieved frequent, durable uMRD. All pts completed therapy (median 10 mo treatment), including 89% (33/37) who met the prespecified PB/BM uMRD endpoint. With a median posttreatment follow-up of 15 mo, 31 (94%) remain uMRD-FC. \u0394MRD400 identified a cohort of pts (40%) with delayed BM MRD clearance and earlier MRD recurrence, despite longer treatment duration. \u0394MRD400 warrants further study as a predictive biomarker for treatment duration.
