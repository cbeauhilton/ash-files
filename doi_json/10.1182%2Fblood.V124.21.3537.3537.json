    "abstract_text": "Leukemias with chromosomal translocation or partial tandem duplications involving the MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) gene have exceptionally poor prognosis (referred to as 11q23-leukemias). At the molecular level, 11q23-leukemias are characterized by aberrant expression of a set of homeodomain transcription factors in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and differentiating myeloid progenitor cells. This transcription factor set includes HoxB3, B4, A7-11, Cdx2-4 and Meis1. Cdx and Hox proteins are involved in regulating hematopoiesis. Transcription of HOX and CDX genes decreases normal myelopoiesis, but is aberrantly sustained in 11q23-leukemias. Cdx4 activates transcription of the HOXA9 and HOXA10 genes, and HoxA10 activates CDX4 transcription. The events that break this feedback loop, permitting a decrease in Cdx4-expression during normal myelopoiesis, were previously undefined. In the current study, we find that HoxA9 represses CDX4 transcription in differentiating myeloid cells; antagonizing activation by HoxA10. We determine that tyrosine phosphorylation of HoxA10 impairs transcriptional activation of CDX4 , but tyrosine phosphorylation of HoxA9 facilitates repression of this gene. Since HoxA9 and HoxA10 are phosphorylated during myelopoiesis, this provides a mechanism for differentiation-stage-specific Cdx4 expression. HoxA9 and HoxA10 are increased in cells expressing Mll-Ell, a leukemia associated MLL1 fusion protein. We find that Mll-Ell induces a HoxA10-dependent increase in Cdx4-expression in myeloid progenitor cells. However, expression of Cdx4 decreases in a HoxA9-dependent manner upon exposure of Mll-Ell-expressing cells to differentiating cytokines. Leukemia associated, constitutively active mutants of Shp2 block cytokine-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of HoxA9 and HoxA10. In comparison to cells expressing Mll-Ell alone, we find that co-expression of Mll-Ell plus constitutively active Shp2 increases CDX4 transcription and Cdx4 expression in myeloid progenitor cells. And, increased Cdx4 expression is sustained upon exposure of these cells to differentiating cytokines. Our results identify a mechanism for increased and sustained CDX4 transcription in leukemias co-overexpressing HoxA9 and HoxA10 in combination with constitutive activation of Shp2. We also demonstrate that inhibition of Shp2-PTP activity decreases Cdx4 expression in Hox-overexpressing human myeloid leukemias. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
