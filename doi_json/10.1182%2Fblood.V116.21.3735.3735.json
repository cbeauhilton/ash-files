    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3735 We have previously demonstrated that while early administration of bortezomib after murine allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) can prevent acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), delayed administration of bortezomib results in increased GVHD-dependent gastrointestinal toxicity (PNAS 2004, Blood 2005). This was primarily mediated by donor CD4 + T cells in fully MHC-mismatched allo-BMT (Blood 2008). In the current study, we assessed continuous bortezomib administration on CD8 + T cell-mediated acute GVHD. Using an MHC-matched, mHAg-mismatched model (C3.SW donor cells into lethally irradiated C57BL/6 recipients) in which acute GVHD is primarily induced by CD8 + T cells, we confirmed that significant skin and liver GVHD was observed after CD8 + T cell transfer. Histological evaluation of acute liver GVHD displayed severe lymphocyte infiltrates and severe subacute bile duct hepatitis consistent with hepatic GVHD. Severe acute skin GVHD was noted by persistent fur loss and skin ulcerations. Cutaneous histopathological assessment exhibited severe inflammatory infiltrates, epidermal hypertrophy, loss of hair follicles, satellite cell necrosis and dermal fibrosis. Notably, after allo-BMT, 6 weeks or thereafter, a significant increase in serum IL-6 levels was observed in the mice exhibiting marked skin damage, suggesting organ-specific correlation of higher serum IL-6 expression with acute cutaneous GVHD associated injury. We next investigated the effects of continuous treatment with bortezomib in this GVHD model. Surprisingly, we found that continuous bortezomib administration at the conventional dose of 0.75\u20131 mg/kg twice per week resulted in fractional GVHD- dependent lethal toxicity, exacerbating lymphocyte infiltration in liver, gut and lung as evidenced by pathological examination. However, skin GVHD pathology was markedly improved. Due to the limitations of conventional doses of bortezomib for treatment of acute GVHD, we then performed a low-dose bortezomib treatment at 0.125 mg/kg, twice per week. We found that mice receiving low-dose bortezomib were protected from lethal toxicity and displayed significant amelioration of skin GVHD pathology. Significant decreases in serum IL-6 levels were also consistently observed consistent with the amelioration of skin GVHD. Interestingly, while skin GVHD was markedly improved, there was no difference in liver, gut and lung pathology compared to control GVHD recipients indicating an organ-specific protection. These results demonstrate that continuous bortezomib can be applied in CD8+ T cell-mediated acute GVHD but necessitates lower dosing and organ-specific protection is observed.
