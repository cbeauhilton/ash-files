    "abstract_text": "The prevalence of survivors of adult AML has previously been calculated, but the prevalent population has not been characterized. We analysed all 6289 patients diagnosed with adult AML from 1997-2013 as reported in the Swedish AML registry, with a complete survival follow-up. We found 1148 patients, 563 males and 585 females, who were alive on January 1, 2014, constituting 18% of the total, and of them 204 (18%) were diagnosed during 2013. Patients who had their initial treatment at pediatric departments, and people diagnosed with AML before 1997 are not included. The mean age of survivors was 53.4 years at diagnosis and 59.3 years in 2014, and 303 (26%) were 70 years or older in 2014. The overall prevalence of patients diagnosed at age 20 or more was 15.2 per 100,000 (males 15.0 and females 15.4 per 100,000). There were 124 with prior acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (11%), 54 with inv(16) (5%), 44 with t(8;21) (4%), and 82 with NPM1 mut/ FLT3 wt (7%), 75 with FLT3 -ITD (7%), and 82 with complex karyotype (7%). Karyotype results were not available in 10%, and molecular data only since 2007. Four hundred two (35%) had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation, out of which 32 (8%) had had complex karyotype, 43 (11%) FLT3 -ITD, 136 (34%) normal karyortype, and 41 (10%) good risk but were transplanted after relapse. Among the 426 non-transplanted prevalent patients who had survived at least 3 years, 94 (22%) had prior APL, 25 (6%) t(8;21), 24 (6%) inv(16), 126 (30%) normal karyotype, and 11 (3%) complex karyotype, including eight monosomal karyotypes and two with del(7) and one del(5q). Among non-complex karyotypes there were four MLL abnormalities, two del(5q) and two monosomy 7. Although long-term survivors more often have pretreatment good-risk features, this patient group is still heterogeneous, and also contains older people and those with intermediate/high risk cyogenetics.
