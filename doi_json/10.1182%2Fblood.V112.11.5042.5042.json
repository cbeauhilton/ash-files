    "abstract_text": "Although 90% patients with untreated acute promyelocytic leukemia(APL) obtain complete remission because of the usage of all-trans retinoic acid(ATRA), patients with ATRA-resistance are increased gradually. ATRA-resistance has become one of the main causes which affect the long-term therapeutic efficacy of APL. The mechanisms of ATRA-resistance are complex, which probably involve the metabolism of ATRA, abnormal expression of cellular retinoic acid binding protein(CRABP) and P-glycoprotein(P-gp), mutation of RAR\u03b1 and aberration translocation of APL. However, in these previous researches, it was one or a few proteins but not the entirety proteins that were emphasized on the mechanisms of ATRA-resistance. Comparative proteomics can analyze the entire protein expression in cells in whole and has the superiority in screening the drug-resistance proteins differentially expressed. In order to investigate the mechanisms of ATRA-resistance in APL in whole, we compared and analyzed the protein expression profiles between MR2 cells(APL cell line with ATRA-resistance) and NB4 cells(APL cell line with ATRA-sensitiveness) by comparative proteomics. After the total proteins of MR2 cells and NB4 cells were extracted respectively, they were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis(2-DE). The differences in proteome profile between MR2 cells and NB4 cells analyzed by ImageMaster \u2122 2D Platinum software. The average protein spots in 2-DE maps of MR2 and NB4 cells were 1160\u00b151 and 1068\u00b133 respectively. 8 protein spots were selected to be identified by Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), in which the quantity of the protein differentially expressed was more than two times(\u22652 or \u22640.5) between MR2 and NB4 cells\u2019 2-DE map. They were all successfully identified and their definite information was obtained. Among them, 6 proteins were probably involved in the mechanisms of ATRA-resistance in APL and they were Cofilin-1, Elongation factor 1-beta (EF-1\u03b2), Tropomyosin isoform(TM), High mobility group protein B1(HMGB1), Ran-specific GTPase-activating protein (RanGAP1) and Galectin-1. Moreover, so far there was no related report on the roles of HMGB1, RanGAP1 and Galectin-1 in the mechanisms of ATRA-resistance in APL. These differential proteins identified provide the new clues for us to further elucidate the mechanisms of ATRA-resistance from multiple factor.",
