    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2063 Poster Board II-40 Introduction: Adults with primary refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have a poor prognosis with complete responses to salvage therapy from 13-15% and a median survival of 1.5-6 months[1, 2]. From 2006-2009, 79 patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia were given salvage chemotherapy with decitabine 20mg/m 2 daily for 10 days or decitabine 20mg/m 2 \u00d7 5 days with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) 3mg/m2 on day 5 at Weill Cornell Medical Center. Methods: Medical records of 79 patients who received decitabine-based salvage therapy were reviewed from September 2006 through July 2009 at Weill Cornell Medical College. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan Meir method and differences in survival calculated by the log-rank test using STATA software. Results: Twenty-five patients received decitabine-based therapy as first salvage, 32 patients as second salvage, and 22 patients as third or greater salvage. Fifty-one patients were treated with decitabine/GO and 29 patients received decitabine alone. Median age of patients was 65.5 years with a range of 24 -89 years (first salvage 75 years, second salvage 62 years, and third or greater salvage 64 years). Median survival of all patients was 205 days, range 7-732 days. Overall 34% patients responded: 16% CR (1000 and Plts > 100,000) with median survival not yet reached; 5% CRp (< 5% blasts in bone marrow, ANC >1000 and plts < 100,000) with median survival 223 days; 13% PR (blasts 6-11%) with median survival 205 days; and 66% no response with median survival 118 days. Patients receiving first salvage had median survival 181 days with CR 13%, CRp 6%, PR 17%. Patients receiving second salvage had median survival 207 days with CR 9%, CRp 4%, PR 9%. Patients with third or greater salvage had median survival 209 days with CR 23%, CRp 0%, PR 14%. Patients receiving decitabine alone had a median survival of 209 days and those receiving decitabine/GO had a median survival of 177 days but the difference was not significant. Median survival for normal, favorable, intermediate and unfavorable cytogenetics was 282, 224, 157 and 176 days respectively (p=0.06). Conclusions: Decitabine-based treatment for relapsed and refractory AML is a low intensity alternative that has activity rivaling more intensive regimens. This retrospective study suggests that further investigation of decitabine-based salvage is warranted. 1.
