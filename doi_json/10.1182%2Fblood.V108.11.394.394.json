    "abstract_text": "Pleckstrin is a 40 kDa phosphoprotein containing amino- and carboxyl-terminal Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domains separated by a DEP domain. Pleckstrin\u2019s expression is restricted to platelets and leukocytes, and represents approximately 1% of total cellular protein within these cells. Following platelet and leukocyte activation, PKC rapidly phosphorylates pleckstrin inducing it to bind membrane bound phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2). Heterologously expressed phosphorylated pleckstrin colocalized with integrins and induces cytoskeletal reorganization. To better define the role of pleckstrin in vivo, we introduced a loss-of-function mutation into the murine pleckstrin gene. Pleckstrin-null mice were present in offspring at a frequency consistent with a Mendelian inheritance pattern. Adult pleckstrin \u2212/\u2212 mice had 32% lower platelet counts than their littermates, but exhibited no spontaneous hemorrhage. Given the role of PKC and phospholipid second messengers on cytoskeletal dynamics, and our observations of pleckstrin overexpression in cell lines, we analyzed whether loss of pleckstrin affected cell spreading. Pleckstrin \u2212/\u2212 platelets spread extremely poorly upon immobilized fibrinogen, and rarely exhibited broad membrane extensions. Granulocytes from pleckstrin \u2212/\u2212 mice also have a spreading defect, as well as impaired ability to generate reactive oxygen species in the response to TNF\u03b1. Knockout B-cells, CD4-T-cells, and CD8-T-cells all migrated approximately 30% as efficiently as wild type cells in response to a gradient of SDF-1\u03b1 in a transwell assay. These data suggest that loss of pleckstrin causes cytoskeletal defects in cells of multiple hematopoietic lineages. Analyzing whether this caused a functional defect, we found that pleckstrin \u2212/\u2212 platelets exhibited a 22% dense- and 24% alpha-granule exocytosis defect, and a 35% defect in thrombin-induced calcium entry. In spite of these abnormalities, platelets changed shape and aggregated normally after stimulation with thrombin, ADP, or collagen in vitro. Pleckstrin knockout platelets did have a markedly impaired aggregation response following exposure to the PKC stimulant, PMA. This suggested that pleckstrin is a critical effector for PKC-mediated aggregation, but another pathway is able to compensate for this loss of pleckstrin following agonist stimulation. We reasoned that the alternative pathway might also utilize PIP2-dependent second messengers. Since the phosphorylation of PIP2 by PI3K generates second messengers that also contribute to platelet aggregation, we tested whether PI3K compensated for the loss of pleckstrin. We found that the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 profoundly impaired the aggregation of pleckstrin knockout platelets in response to stimulation of the thrombin receptor. In contrast, the PI3K inhibitor minimally affected wild type platelets. This demonstrates that second messengers generated by PI3K are able to compensate for loss of pleckstrin. This also demonstrates that thrombin-induced platelet aggregation can be mediated by one of two parallel pathways, one involving PKC and pleckstrin, and the other involving PI3K. Together, our results show that pleckstrin is an essential component of PKC-mediated platelet activation and signals directed to the cytoskeleton."
