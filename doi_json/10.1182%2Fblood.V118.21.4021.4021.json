    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4021 Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) manifests with autoimmune symptoms (i.e. increased serum levels of autoantibodies, donor T cell infiltration in skin and salivary gland tissues, and collagen deposition in skin tissues). Donor B cells have been indicated to play an important role in the pathogenesis of cGVHD in mouse models as well as in patients, but the mechanisms remain unclear. In the current studies, using a cGVHD mouse model of DBA/2 donor to MHC-matched BALB/c host, we have observed that donor B cells are activated by donor CD4 + T cells in transplants to upregulate MHC II and co-stimulatory molecules and produce IgG autoantibodies; in turn, donor B cells mediated clonal expansion of autoreactive donor-type CD4 + T cells, as judged by TCR spectratyping and in vitro T cell proliferation in response to donor- and host-type APCs. Kinetic studies showed that the presence of donor B cells in transplants was associated with persistence of GVHD target tissue damage (i.e. sclerodermatous skin) and persistence of donor CD4 + T infiltration in the tissues in which there is an expansion of Th1 and Th2 but not Th17. The presence of donor B cells in transplants also markedly augmented tissue damage in prototypical cGVHD targets such as the salivary gland. Sorted donor CD4 + T cells from primary recipients given donor B cell-containing transplants but not from the primary recipients given B cell-depleted transplants caused cGVHD-like tissue damage in the skin and salivary gland of adoptive recipients. These results indicate that donor B cells in bone marrow transplants play an important role in the generation and expansion of pathogenic CD4 + T cells that mediate chronic GVHD tissue damage.
