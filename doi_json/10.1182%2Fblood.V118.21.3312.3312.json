    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3312 The European Network of Rare Bleeding Disorders (EN-RBD) was established to bridge the gap between knowledge and practice in the care of patients with RBDs (rare bleeding disorders frequency <1/0.5-2M). The aim of this first report was to explore the relationship between the coagulation factor activity levels and clinical bleeding severity in patients with RBDs. A total of 592 records on patients with RBDs were cross-sectionally collected over a period of three years. Data on clinical bleeding episodes were available for 495 patients and were classified into four categories according to severity. The mean age of patients was 31 years (range, 7 months-95 years), with 51% being females. On linear regression analysis, there was a strong association between coagulation factor activity level and clinical bleeding severity for fibrinogen, factor (F)FX, FXIII, and combined FV and FVIII deficiencies. A weaker association was present for FV and FVII deficiencies. There was no association between coagulation factor activity level and clinical bleeding severity for FXI. It is of clinical relevance to identify levels that are not associated with spontaneous major bleeding, which was done by constructing receiver operating characteristic curves. These levels were highest for FXIII deficiency (25 U/dl), followed by FV+VII (15 U/dl), FVII (15 U/dl), FX (5 U/dl), and FV (1 U/dl) deficiencies. For fibrinogen deficiency, a factor activity level of 20 mg/dl is needed to ensure absence of major spontaneous bleeding. There is a clear relation between coagulation factor activity level and clinical bleeding severity in RBDs, which is different for the missing clotting factor.
