    "abstract_text": "Hereditary hemolytic anemia is caused by defects in hemoglobin, in the red blood cell (RBC) cytoskeleton proteins, or by deficiencies in RBC enzymes. RBC cytoskeletal disorders include hereditary spherocytosis (HS), elliptocytosis (HE), pyropoikilocytosis (HPP), and stomatocytosis (HSt), which are typically inherited as autosomal dominant disorders but can also present as recessive forms, frequently severe. The RBC enzymopathies, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, are X-linked or recessively inherited disorders causing hemolytic anemia. Although rare, congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDA) are inherited red cell lineage disorders which occasionally, especially CDA-II, can be misdiagnosed as HS. Diagnosis of an inherited hemolytic anemia not due to a hemoglobin disorder is based upon morphology of the RBCs, functional analysis of the RBCs through ektacytometry or osmotic fragility, and enzymatic assays. The diagnosis of severely affected patients is complicated by transfusion dependence. Diagnosis based on genetic mutations is attractive, especially in transfused patients, and provides additional insight into the mechanisms of disease. Despite these advantages, genetic diagnoses have been limited by expense and long turn-around times for clinical results. To address these issues, we have developed a rapid comprehensive clinical next-generation sequencing-based assay that evaluates 27 genes with published disease-causing mutations for RBC cytoskeletal disorders, enzymopathies, and CDAs. The protein-coding exons plus 25 bases of exon/intron junction as well as promoter sequences with known relationship to clinical phenotypes were included in the design. Genomic DNA was digested with a panel of 8 restriction enzymes and oligonucleotide probes were used to enrich the target regions. Enriched samples were then sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq benchtop sequencer with 150 base pair, paired-end reads. Enrichment and sequencing were completed within 48 hours. Sequencing reads were aligned to the human genome reference sequence and analysis of coverage and variants was completed using NextGENe software. Initial validation included 5 affected probands, 1 affected sibling of a proband, 4 parental samples, and 2 unrelated control individuals with no history of hemolytic anemia. Overall, > 99% of all nucleotides in the regions of interest had at least 20X sequencing coverage. Our assay confirmed a previously identified maternally inherited nonsense mutation, Y1089X, and a paternally inherited A970D missense variant in SPTA1 in a patient (SPCA) with severe HS. The A970D SPTA1 missense change was also seen in two unaffected parents and an unaffected control, further validating that this missense variant alone does not cause dominant HS. The common SPTA1 allele, \u03b1 LELY was seen in the clinically unaffected mother of SPCA, but was not found in the affected child, suggesting that this allele must be inherited in trans with a pathologic SPTA1 mutation to have clinical effect. Analysis of additional probands revealed both dominant and recessive forms of HS due to mutations in ANK1 . Patient AAHS2 presented with typical dominant HS, and was found to have a novel ANK1 frameshift mutation, c.3464delG. Patient HEEM presented with severe transfusion-dependent anemia and was found to have one reported ANK1 missense mutation, T1075I (ankyrin Tubarao) in the spectrin-binding domain, and one novel nonsense mutation, Y735X. In addition, we identified novel amino acid changes in the newly identified dehydrated HSt gene PIEZO1. HEGR, a patient with hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly and portal vein thrombosis in infancy was found to have a novel 6 base pair insertion at R1462 in PIEZO1. Thal1 was previously diagnosed with dominant \u03b2-thalassemia, however had a more severe presentation than expected. We found a PIEZO1 missense mutation R2302H in Thal1 that likely explains the severe phenotype. The initial validation of this comprehensive sequencing assay has demonstrated that this is a robust and rapid diagnostic tool for patients with severe hereditary hemolytic anemia. Simultaneous investigation of the key protein-coding genes involved in proper RBC function and survival, provides new insight into the variable phenotypes of patients with hemolytic anemia and ultimately will improve the management of patients with severe disease.
