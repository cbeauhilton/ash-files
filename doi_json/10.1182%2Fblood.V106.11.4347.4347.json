    "abstract_text": "Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) is a multifunctional cytokine involved in a variety of biological processes including development, cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, cell adhesion, migration, extracellular matrix deposition, and the immune response. The loss of a growth inhibitory response to TGF-\u03b21 is a common feature of many cancers. Human myeloblastic ML2 cells originally obtained from Dr. Minowada ( Palumbo A. et al., Blood  64 , 1059 \u20131063, 1984 ) were pre-incubated with or without TGF-\u03b21 (5 or 10 ng/ml) or with TGF-\u03b21 antibody for 24 h or 72h and then incubated for further 4 h in the presence of [6-3H] thymidine. TGF-\u03b21 did not decreased the proliferation of ML2 cells measured by incorporation of [6-3H] thymidine into DNA in comparison with control without TGF-\u03b21 or with ML2 cells icubated in the presence of inactivating TGF-\u03b21antibody. The resistance of ML2 cells to TGF-\u03b21-induced growth arrest is not caused by mutation in TGF-\u03b21 receptors (T\u03b2RII and ALK5) or Smad4 as we verified by direct sequencing of exons of these genes. After 24 h incubation TGF-\u03b21 increased the levels of mRNA for some target proteins of TGF-\u03b21 -plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, Smad7, SnoN and SnoA (ski novel related gene products), inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (p15/INK4b, p21/WAF1/CIP1) and decreased the levels of mRNA for c-myc, transferrin receptor 1 and inhibitor of differentiation/DNA binding Id1. TGF-\u03b21 did not affect the levels of mRNA for CDC25 phosphatase and RhoA GTPase. The levels of these mRNA were determined by real-time PCR or semiquantitative PCR using specific oligonucleotide primers. The increased expression of SnoN and SnoA genes and the inability of TGF-\u03b21 to cause SnoN degradation may be the cause of ML2 cells resistance to TGF-\u03b21 -induced growth arrest. Antiproliferative genes coding for p15/INK4b, p21/WAF1/CIP1 are not under control of SnoN and SnoA. SnoN (684 aminoacids) and SnoA (415 aminoacids) are the alternatively spliced isoforms. Both these isoforms contain the N-terminal region that is similar to the ski (sloan kettering virus gene product) protooncoprotein. These oncoproteins are incorporated into the histone deacetylase-1 complex through binding to the nuclear corepressor and Smad (Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4) proteins and repress the activity of Smad proteins. The addition of histone deacetylase inhibitors (0.5\u03bcM MS-275 or 1mM sodium butyrate) in combination with TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml or 10 ng/ml) in pre-incubation of ML2 cells for 24 h before the incorporation of [6-3H] thymidine into DNA measurement decreased proliferation of ML2 cells in comparison with ML2 cells without additions (control) or ML2 cells with TGF-\u03b21 or histone deacetylase inhibitors. These results support the role of Sno protooncoproteins in resistance of ML2 cells to TGF-\u03b21-induced growth arrest.
