    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2142 Background: VCR is an important component of the treatment of ALL, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, and other adult and childhood cancers. In part, because of the cell cycle specific activity of VCR, its anti-cancer activity is believed to be very exposure time and concentration dependent. Standard dosing of conventional VCR (1.4 mg/m 2 with a 2 mg cap) is limited because of early onset peripheral neuropathy and fails to achieve sustained VCR delivery. VSLI (Marqibo) is a nano-particle encapsulated formulation of VCR designed to facilitate dose intensification, prolonged drug delivery and enhanced cancer penetration and concentration. Methods: In a pivotal, Phase 2, multi-national study (RALLY Trial), 65 adults with Philadelphia chromosome negative ALL who were either in second or greater relapse or who had progressed after two or more prior lines of treatment received single-agent intravenous VSLI 2.25 mg/m 2 (without any dose cap) weekly over 1 hour as salvage therapy. First-dose PK was investigated in a representative subset of 13 study subjects. Blood for analysis was collected at 8 time points ranging from 5 minutes to 48 hours following infusion. Total VCR plasma levels were determined by HPLC-MS/MS. PK parameters were calculated with Phoenix WinNonlin. Results: The PK subject subset had a median body surface area (BSA) of 1.92 m 2 (range 1.47 to 2.45 m 2 ) and received a median VSLI dose (VCR component) of 4.32 mg (range 3.3 to 5.51 mg). Based on BSA and the 2 mg dose cap, all subjects in this study group would have been dosed with 2.0 mg of conventional VCR. The median cumulative induction dose of VSLI (VCR component) that was administered in this study was 18.8 mg (range 3.5 to 70.1 mg). Total VCR plasma concentration decreased rapidly from C max after the VSLI infusion in 5 subjects (38%); 8 subjects (62%) exhibited a delay of 4 to 10 hours before the total VCR plasma concentration began to decrease. The calculated T max was 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 hours (range 1.1 to 2.0 hours). The C max was 1214 \u00b1 233 ng/mL (range 919 to 1720 ng/mL). The apparent mean half-life was 7.1 \u00b1 3.2 hours. The mean AUC inf was 13,993 \u00b1 6,588 ng hr/mL with a range from 7,167 to 27,233 ng hr/mL. The mean clearance (CL) was 6.4 \u00b1 2.6 mL/min. The mean volume of distribution (Vd) was 0.051 \u00b1 0.018 L/Kg. There were no significant differences in the PK parameters between the male and female subjects participating in this study. The table below presents VSLI PK parameters in addition to historical PK parameters for conventional VCR dosed at 2 mg.  . C max (ng/mL) . CL (mL/min) . AUC inf (ng hr/mL) . Vd (L/Kg) .

View Large Conclusions: VSLI clearly provides dose intensification and prolonged VCR delivery compared to conventional, non-encapsulated VCR. VSLI, as dosed in this adult ALL clinical trial, delivered individual and cumulative amounts of VCR that exceed those achievable with standard and approved dosing of conventional VCR. This translated into a median dose intensification of 116% (range 65 to 176 percent) calculated as the percent change in VSLI dose from a standard VCR dose. This dose intensification is believed to have contributed to the 35% overall response rate including 20% complete responses (with or without full blood count recovery) reported in this heavily pre-treated, multiply-relapsed/refractory population without apparent enhanced toxicity [J Clin Oncol 28:15s, 2010 (suppl; abst 6507)]. VSLI has a distinctly different PK profile than conventional VCR. The larger VSLI C max and AUC inf reflect the dose intensification afforded by a larger mg/m 2 dose and lack of dose capping. Even in the absence of dose capping, the 2.25 mg/m 2 VSLI dose represents a 61% dose escalation above conventional VCR. While C max and AUC inf are dose-dependent PK parameters, the observed differences between VSLI and VCR control cannot be explained by dose alone. The larger AUC inf also reflects prolonged circulation afforded by the sphingomyelin:cholesterol liposome encapsulation. The modest VSLI mean CL and small Vd reflect the retention of encapsulated VCR within the plasma compartment for an extended period of time so that VCR can better penetrate and accumulate in sites of cancer through fenestrated vasculature. The enhanced delivery of encapsulated VCR contributes to maintenance of VCR concentrations above the effective concentration. Disclosures: Silverman: Hana Biosciences: Employment.
