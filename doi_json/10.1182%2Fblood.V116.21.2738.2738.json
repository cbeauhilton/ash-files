Here we evaluated the feasibility of measuring circulating TK (cTK) activity in plasma in patients with BCR-ABL1-positive leukemia. Patients and Methods: Study subjects included 46 patients with newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 24 with multidrug-resistant CML, 24 with BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), as well as 38 healthy donors. Plasma cTK activity was measured using a chromogenic universal TK assay in which plasma samples and standards were added to wells of a microtiter plate that were coated with synthesized poly(Glu-Tyr) peptide substrates. Specific TK activity was measured by spectrophotometry, with or without addition of TKIs. Results: cTK activity was significantly higher in CML (median 801.93 U/mL, range 18.10\u20133932.30 U/mL) and BCR-ABL1-positive ALL patients (median 659.55 U/mL, range 0\u20131626.90 U/mL) than in healthy donors (median 82.85 U/mL, range 0.63\u2013852.80 U/mL) (P<0.001). Plasma cTK activity was closely correlated with cellular BCR-ABL1 kinase activation, as indicated by phosphorylation of the downstream signaling proteins CRKL ( P <0.001) and STAT-5 ( P =0.003). However, cTK activity was independent of BCR-ABL1 transcript level and BCR-ABL1 mutation type. Plasma cTK activity was inhibited by imatinib and dasatinib in ex vivo studies; this inhibition was severely diminished in patients harboring T315I mutations. Conclusions: cTK activity is readily detectable in plasma or serum samples without pre-cleaning or enrichment. Ex vivo testing measuring the effect of TKIs on plasma cTK activity thus hold promise as drug sensitivity tests for predicting and monitoring response to specific TKIs.
