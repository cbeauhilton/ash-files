    "abstract_text": "Background: The majority of pts with MF present with a mutation in exon 14 of the JAK2 gene ( JAK2 V617F ). Studies have suggested that in pts with MF and this mutation, a lower AB is associated with a myelodepletive phenotype and shortened survival (Tefferi, Leukemia 2008; Guglielmelli Blood 2009; reviewed in Vannucchi, Ther Adv Hematol 2011). For example, in a Cox proportional hazard model for factors predictive of overall survival (OS) in pts with primary MF, a JAK2 V617F AB of <25% was associated with a shortened OS (p=0.002; Guglielmelli, Blood 2009). In the phase III trials of ruxolitinib (RUX) therapy in JAK inhibitor-na\u00efve MF, RUX-treated pts had a median decrease in AB of 16% (maximal) in COMFORT-I followed up to 216 weeks and 7% in COMFORT-II at 48 weeks. The median AB at the start of therapy was not reported for COMFORT-I and in COMFORT-II was 84.5% (Cervantes, Blood 2013; Deininger, Blood 2015). Methods: In this communication, we report on clinical correlates of quantitative baseline JAK2 mutational status and the effect of treatment on JAK2 V617F mutational burden in the PERSIST-1 trial. This trial enrolled JAK inhibitor-na\u00efve pts with primary or secondary MF without restrictions on baseline platelet counts, randomized 2:1 between PAC and BAT (excluding JAK2 inhibitors) arms. Stratifications included Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) risk category, and baseline platelet counts (100,000/\u03bcL). Following the 24-week primary analysis, crossover was allowed by physician/pt choice and 90/107 BAT-treated pts (84%) crossed over to receive PAC. Baseline characteristics have been previously reported (Mesa, ASCO 2016) and included 203/327 (62%) pts with Primary MF, 42 (13%) with post-essential thrombocythemia MF and 81 (25%) with post-polycythemia vera MF. 320 of 327 pts had informative PCR testing for JAK2 V617F . We report the baseline characteristics of pts with high (\u226550%) AB of JAK2 V617F , low (<50%) AB of JAK2 V617F and those without a detectable mutation at baseline (<0.1%), as well as the effect of PAC and BAT on AB and correlation with outcome measures. Results: 131 (40.9%) had AB >50% (high AB), 115 (35.9%) had an AB \u22650.1% and \u226450% (low AB), and 74 (23.1%) had AB <0.1% (wild-type JAK2 ). Median AB values were 80.3% for the high AB group and 30.3% for the low AB group. Baseline characteristics that were significantly different between high and low AB pts are shown in the Table . No differences were noted in the DIPSS risk category or baseline percentage of blasts between pts with low or high AB. There were a higher percentage of pts with a lower AB in the PAC arm (64% vs. 48%; p=0.01). PAC therapy resulted in a median decrement in AB at Week 24 of \u221215.8% vs \u22127.9% for pts in the BAT arm ( Figure ). The median greatest reduction from baseline in AB in PAC-treated pts was \u221231.6%. Decrease in AB was strongly correlated with spleen volume reduction (p=0.003) and trended towards correlation with improvement in total symptom score (p=0.07) in PAC-treated, but not in BAT-treated pts. Overall survival was shorter in PAC-treated pts with a minimal AB reduction vs pts with greater decreases in AB. Conclusions : In the PERSIST-1 trial, pts with a JAK2 V617F AB of 50% AB despite similar distribution of DIPSS scores. In this trial, reduction in AB associated with PAC, but not BAT correlated with clinical benefit.
