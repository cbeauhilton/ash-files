    "abstract_text": "Background: Cerebrovascular disease, particularly overt stroke, is one of the most critical clinical complications of sickle cell disease (SCD). Individual stroke risk for patients with SCD is assessed by measuring trans-cranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) velocity. While TCD screening and resulting use of chronic blood transfusion therapy in patients with abnormal TCDs has reduced stroke incidence in patients with SCD from 11% to 1%, the test has significant limitations. It can only be performed on children old enough to remain still for the assessment, or young enough to have open bony windows; typically 2-16 years of age. Additionally the test has poor positive predictive value, causing patients to be placed on chronic transfusion therapy who would not have gone on to have a stroke. Hydroxyurea (HU) is replacing chronic transfusion therapy in many institutions for primary stroke prevention, but many sites initiate a \"cooling off\" period of transfusions prior to initiating HU, and transfusion therapy may be indicated for abnormal TCD velocities in patients already on HU. The pathophysiology of stroke in SCD patients is not completely understood, but vascular remodeling, abnormal cerebral blood flow, and vaso-occlusion all play a role. Plasma levels of Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), myeloperoxidase (MPO), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) have been shown to be associated with high trans-cranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) velocity in children with SCD; but there is limited data on their potential association with stroke in this population. BDNF is a neurotropin that is responsive to hypoxia and promotes neurogenesis as well as playing a key role in the regulation of the cell survival pathway; myeloperoxidase (MPO) promotes vascular injury by oxygen radical generation, leukocyte/neutrophil recruitment, and oxidative stress; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) is and endothelial adhesion molecule involved in the pathophysiology of vaso-occlusion in SCD through promoting RBC adhesion; and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) is expressed on endothelial and immune system cells and is thought to be a ligand for leukocyte adhesion. We hypothesized that BDNF, MPO, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 may be involved in stroke in SCD, and may be potential biomarkers to be used to assess an individual with SCD's stroke risk in addition to TCD. Methods: We collected plasma samples from the peripheral blood of fifteen SCD patients (HbSS) at the time of either silent cerebral infarct (SCI) or stroke. Stroke (n=8) or SI was confirmed by MRI using diffusion imaging and T2 FLAIR. The cohort included 6 females and 9 males between the ages of 3 and 20 years. Plasma from fifteen age and gender matched control patients with HbSS but had normal MRIs and TCD velocities less than 170 m/s. We measured plasma levels of BDNF, MPO, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 using antibody immobilized fluorescent beads (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and Luminex xMAP technology (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Student's t-test was used to analyze the difference in plasma levels between the stroke and control groups. Results and Conclusions: BDNF levels were significantly higher in the stroke group than in the control group; 2978.2 \u00b1 960.3 pg/ml compared to 2200.8 \u00b1 758.4 pg/ml, p=0.005. Difference in MPO levels between the two groups approached significance; 36617.2 \u00b1 14828.9 pg/ml compared to 29521.9 \u00b1 7889.6 pg/ml, p=0.07. Difference in VCAM-1 levels also approached significance; 143997.0 \u00b1 9963.8 pg/ml compared to 138126.9 \u00b1 11902.0 pg/ml, p=0.08, but there was no significant difference in ICAM-1 levels. Only BDNF plasma levels positively correlated with the area and volume of the infarct, p=0.009. These results further support the assertion that BDNF is involved in the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular disease in SCD. It is possible that MPO and VCAM-1 may also play a role, and that a significant difference was not found due to sample size limitations. Plasma BDNF levels, and possibly MPO and VCAM-1 plasma levels, have potential as biomarkers for stroke risk to improve the positive predictive value of TCD velocities in patients with SCD, or to assess risk in patients unable to receive TCDs.
