    "abstract_text": "Background: Case reports and small case series suggest that women with von Willebrand disease (VWD) are at a very high risk of bleeding complications with hysterectomy. Because the procedure may be beneficial to women who suffer from heavy menstrual bleeding, an understanding of the true risks involved is essential for appropriate decision making. Objectives: To estimate the incidence of bleeding and other complications in women with VWD who undergo hysterectomy. Methods: The United States Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for the years 1988\u20132004 was queried for all hysterectomies for nonmalignant conditions. Data were analyzed based on the NIS sampling design. Bivariate analyses were used to examine the differences between women with and without VWD. Multivariate analysis was used to adjust for potential confounders among women who underwent hysterectomy for heavy menstrual bleeding. Results: 545 of the 1,358,133 hysterectomies were to women with VWD. Women with VWD were significantly more likely to experience intraoperative and postoperative bleeding (2.75% versus 0.89%, p < 0.001) and require transfusion (7.34% versus 2.13%, p < 0.001) than women without VWD. One woman with VWD died (odds ratio = 28.49). Conclusions : While the risk of bleeding complications from hysterectomy in women with VWD is smaller than previously reported, women with VWD did experience significantly more bleeding complications than women without VWD. Nonetheless, for women who have completed childbearing, the risks of hysterectomy may be acceptable."
