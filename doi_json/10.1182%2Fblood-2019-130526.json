    "abstract_text": "Upon sensing chemoattractant signals, leukocytes migrate towards the chemoattractant. If the signal is extravascular, circulating leukocytes roll on the surface of endothelial cells, firmly adhere and migrate through the endothelial monolayer to the inflammation site. Transendothelial migration of leukocytes requires integrins, particularly \u03b2 2 family of integrins. We previously demonstrated that the heterotrimeric G protein subunit G\u03b113 interacts with the cytoplasmic domains of certain integrin \u03b2 subunits including \u03b22. To understand the role of G\u03b113 in integrin-dependent neutrophil migration, myeloid-specific G\u03b113 deficient mice have been generated by cross-breeding lysozyme M-cre mice with G\u03b113-floxed mice. Neutrophil migration was attenuated in myeloid-specific G\u03b113 knockout mice in a thioglycolate (3%) induced peritonitis model in vivo, and was also attenuated in transendothelial or mouse ICAM-1-coated transwell migration assays ex vivo. In contrast, endothelial cell/ICAM-independent transwell migration was not affected. Importantly, on an ICAM-coated surface, only the speed of migration of G\u03b113-deficient neutrophils were attenuated but migration directionality was not affected, suggesting that G\u03b113 plays an important role in motility rather than chemoattractant sensing. To further determine the role of G\u03b113-\u03b22 integrin interaction in leukocyte migration, we examined the effect of a peptide, MB 2 mP 6 , derived from the G\u03b113 binding site of integrin \u03b2 2 subunit. Like G\u03b113 deficiency, MB 2 mP 6 inhibited integrin-dependent neutrophil transendothelial migration, but had minimal effects on leukocyte transwell migration in the absence of endothelial cell monolayer. G\u03b113 plays dual role in RhoA regulation. GPCR-activated G\u03b113 binds to and activates RhoGEFs resulting in RhoA activation, but G\u03b113 binding to integrin cytoplasmic domain is associated inhibition of RhoA. Interestingly, treatment with MB2mP6 enhanced RhoA activity of neutrophils adherent on ICAM1, suggesting that MB2mP6 mainly affects G\u03b113-\u03b22 interaction. These data suggest that G\u03b113-integrin interaction plays an important role in the integrin-dependent transendothelial migration. Thus, G\u03b113-\u03b22 is important in the immune and inflammatory functions of neutrophils. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
