    "abstract_text": "After allogeneic bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood stem (PBSC)cells transplantation, the occurrence of PTLDs most frequently associated with EBV represent a serious clinical management problem. Identification of risk factors to allow preventive strategies could be useful. In this single center retrospective study from1999 to 2003, we analyzed the EBV virus load in the graft and the EBV serological pretransplant status from 21 recipients with a PTLD and 28 control allografted patients without PTLDs. All patients received a non T cells depleted stem cells transplantation from geno and matched unrelated identical donors for various hematological disorders. The median time from graft to he onset of PTLD was two months (range 1\u20138 months). All the PTLDs patients received ATG in the conditioning regimen and had an EBV real time-PCR (RT-PCR) highly positive at time of diagnostic. First, we assessed the EBV viral load in the infused cells by RT-PCR. In the PTLDs group, only 2 cases( one BM and one PBSC) contained infected EBV cells: 1,3x10e7 and 4,33x10e8 per 10e6 cells respectively. In the control group, we did not detect copies (the difference was not significant). The recipient pretransplant EBV infection status (median time: 15 days before transplant) was completed with serology anti-EA (IgA,IgG) and anti -VCA(IgA). Results are in the table 1. We found only a significant difference (p=0,00023) between the recipients with PTLDs and the control group for the early antigens positivity. Anti-EA are associated with a reactivation of EBV. In conclusion, the EBV viral load in the infused cells is not associated with the onset of PTLD. However, our findings suggest that the detection of IgG antibodies to EA antigens in the recipient pretransplant serology could be a predictive marker of the early onset of a PTLD.
