    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is an accepted treatment modality for selected malignant diseases. However, the ability to identify suitable related or unrelated donors can be difficult in some patients (pts). Alternative sources of stem cells such as cord blood (UCB) provide a readily available graft mainly for pediatric patients. Between October 1996 and May 2008, 23 consecutive patients (pts), with a median age of 6 years old (range:1 \u2013 11), 13 male and 10 female, underwent UCB transplant for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n= 15), acute myeloid leukemia (n=7) and acute byphenotypic leukemia (n= 1). Conditioning regimen consisted of intravenous busulfan (3.2 mg/kg/day x 4 days), cyclophosphamide (120 mg/Kg) and rabbit antithymocyte globuline (15 mg/Kg) \u00b1melphalan (140 mg/m 2 ) and GVHD prophylaxis consisted of a calcineurin inhibitor and MMF or MTX. All grafts were HLA mismatched. The median infused cell doses were, respectively 3.2\u00d7 10 7 /kg (range: 1.2\u201321) and 1.27\u00d710 5 /kg (range:0.2\u20134.3) for nucleated cells (NC) and CD34 + cells. Engraftment occurred in 18 pts (75%). Five pts failed engraftment, of wich 4 underwent a second transplant (3 autologous and 1 haploidentical) and 1 died of infection at day +59. Grade II\u2013IV acute GVHD occurred in 12 pt and chronic GVHD in 2 of 14 pt at risk. With a median follow up of 1,5 years (range: 3 months-9.5 years), overall survival (OS) at 3 years is 40% (\u00b1 13%) and event free survival (EFS) at 3 years is 32% (\u00b1 11%). Non relapse mortality (NRM) was 13.6 % (\u00b1 7.3%). UCB transplants represents a valuable alternative to bone marrow or peripheral blood especially for pts requiring urgent transplant or lacking an HLA matched unrelated donor and having the potential advantage of an immune tolerance allowing successful transplantation despite HLA disparity"
