Background The CALISTO trial demonstrated the clinical benefit of anticoagulant therapy in patients with spontaneous isolated superficial-vein thrombosis (SVT) in the legs (n=3002). 1 Compared with placebo, a 45-day once-daily subcutaneous treatment with fondaparinux 2.5 mg was associated with a 85% relative reduction in the risk of the composite of all-cause death and adjudicated symptomatic thromboembolic complications at day 47, a benefit that was maintained at 30-day follow-up (day 77) and was not associated with an increased bleeding risk. The benefit of fondaparinux was observed with the same magnitude on each thromboembolic component of the primary efficacy outcome, including symptomatic extension of SVT to the sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ). However, although all symptomatic extensions of the index SVT were reported and reviewed, only those within 3 cm of the SFJ were counted for the primary outcome. To better characterize the efficacy of fondaparinux we used a new composite efficacy outcome, including all symptomatic extensions of SVT, regardless of their distance from the SFJ. Methods The composite thromboembolic outcome of the original primary endpoint of the CALISTO trial included symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE), symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), symptomatic extension of the index SVT to \u22643 cm (EXT \u22643 cm) from the SFJ, and symptomatic recurrence of SVT (composite outcome CO-1). In a post-hoc analysis, we additionally included in the composite outcome (CO-2) all symptomatic extensions of the index SVT regardless of their final distance from the SFJ (EXT >3 cm). All symptomatic thromboembolic events were confirmed by appropriate objective tests and reviewed by an independent, central, blinded adjudication committee. Results Overall, symptomatic EXT \u22643 cm and EXT >3 cm of index SVT at day 77 were reported in 59 (2.0%) and 68 patients (2.3%), respectively. Compared with placebo, fondaparinux significantly reduced at day 77 both the rate of CO-1, from 6.2% (93/1500) to 1.1% (17/1502; RR, 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11 to 0.31, p<0.001) and the rate of CO-2, from 9.4% (141/1500) to 1.9% (29/1502; RR, 0.21, 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.30, p<0.001). 1 Fondaparinux significantly lowered the rate of symptomatic EXT >3 cm from 3.7% (56/1500) to 0.8% (12/1501; RR, 0.21, 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.40, p3 cm also experienced symptomatic PE or DVT during the course of the trial. In the fondaparinux group, none of the patients with SVT extension, reaching \u22643 cm or >3 cm from the SFJ, experienced symptomatic PE or DVT. Fondaparinux was associated with less use of medical resources, particularly in terms of surgery to treat SVT or need for anticoagulant therapy (Table). Conclusion Extension of the index SVT is a clinically relevant complication of the disease, regardless of the distance of the extension from the SFJ, and is associated with additional use of medical resources. Compared with placebo, fondaparinux reduced the rate of symptomatic thromboembolic complications in patients with spontaneous isolated SVT in the legs. Table.
