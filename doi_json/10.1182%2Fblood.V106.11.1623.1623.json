    "abstract_text": "Background: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) can be the first sign of occult cancer. It is still a matter of debate if screening programs for cancer should be encouraged. No one would advocate extensive screening in an at random VTE-population. It is, however, possible that a subgroup of VTE-patients has a relatively high risk for developing cancer. Objective: To identify a group of patients with a high prevalence of cancer during follow-up (occult cancer). Results: We retrospectively reviewed the prevalence and type of cancer in 610 consecutive VTE-patients (267 men and 343 women). Mean age of the patients was 51.9 years and the mean follow-up was 50 months. There were 73 cancer cases (overall prevalence 12%): 32 patients were known with active cancer and 14 patients were diagnosed with cancer at presentation with VTE. A total of 27 patients (4.8%; 27/564) had cancer during follow-up. Among patients with VTE secondary to immobilisation, increased estrogens levels or thrombophilia (n=382) the prevalence of cancer was significantly lower compared to the 228 patients with idiopathic VTE (1.5% versus 10%; p4000 \u03bcg/L FEU) at VTE-presentation. The two patients younger than 60 years and occult cancer within 24 months both had a D-dimer concentration >4000 \u03bcg/L FEU. In patients older than 60 years and cancer within 24 months after idiopathic VTE, 77.8% (7/9) had initial high D-dimer concentration compared to 22.2% (2/9) with low D-dimer concentration (<4000 \u03bcg/L FEU). Five patients diagnosed with cancer after 36 months had all low D-dimer concentrations (<4000 \u03bcg/L FEU). The relative risk (RR) of cancer during follow-up was determined by calculating the expected number of cancer using the age and sex specific incidence rates of cancer among the general Dutch population (Netherlands Cancer Registry). At 6 months the RR of being diagnosed with cancer was 5.9 (95% CI= 1.6\u201315.1), at 12 months the RR was 9.1 (95% CI= 3.34\u201319.8), at 24 months the RR was 3.3 (95% CI= 0.9\u20138.3) and at 36 months the RR was 1 (95 % CI= 0.03\u20135.7). Conclusion: Screening for cancer in patients with VTE may be limited to patients older than 60 years with idiopathic VTE and to patients with high D-dimer concentration (>4000 \u03bcg/L FEU). Within 2 years of follow-up patients with idiopathic VTE have the highest risk for being diagnosed with cancer when compared to the general population."
