    "abstract_text": "Umbilical cord is an extra-embryonic-annex rich of both hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and it is easily accessible. The HSPC derived from umbilical cord blood (UCB) are promising as graft for allogeneic bone marrow (BM) transplantation and as source of target cells for autologous HSPC gene correction. UCB-HSPC have several advantages compared to adult ones: a less risk of graft-versus-host disease, a higher frequency of progenitors with a greater clonogenic potential and more susceptibility to be transduced by lentiviral vectors. Nonetheless, the HSPC yield from single cord blood unit is not sufficient for these clinical approaches in adults. Therefore, ex-vivo expansion of HSPC in media supplemented by cytokines and/or in vitro culture systems with feeder layers, is a valid approach to exceed this limit. MSC are a component of BM-microenvironment that play a key role in supporting of hematopoiesis by ability to secrete soluble factors and probably by the direct cell-cell interaction too. In this work, we investigated the ability of umbilical cord extracellular matrix-MSC (Wharton's Jelly-MSC) to support the ex-vivo expansion of UBC- purified CD34+ cells. In particular, we evaluated the fold increase, and the frequency of CD34+ cell and CD34+subtypes during expansion at the following culture conditions: by direct contact with WJ-MSC layer, by exposure to the soluble factors secreted by WJ-MSC layer in transwell system. The fold expansion was compared with the CD34+ cells expanded in a customized serum-free medium. CD34+ cells were isolated by immuneselection from 8 fresh UCB. The WJ-MSC were isolated from UC cut-pieces by non-enzymatic procedure but thanks to their capacity to migrate to plastic substrate. At the confluence of 60-70% the WJ-MSC were treated with mytomicin-C to arrest the cell cycle. After 48h, the immune-selected CD34+ cells were seeded in WJ-MSC at the density of 5-10 x10 4 in 12 well plates by direct or indirect contact (by transwell system). CD34+cells were grown in absence of feeder layers at the same conditions. Early hematopoietic cytokines (Flt-3, TPO, SCF) were supplemented in all three conditions and freshly replaced every two days of culture. Numbers and frequency of CD34+cells were evaluated according to ISHAGE method and CD34+ subtyping was performed by four color method to investigated the co-expression of the primitive surface antigens (CD38, CD133, CD90). The frequency of CD34+ cells at day 5 of culture decreased only 10% and was about 50% after 8 days of culture in conditions. The expansion of CD34 + cells at direct contact with WJ-MSC was superior (5.5 fold increase) compared to that of the other two conditions (3 fold on average). At day 8of culture, the CD34+ cells expanded 12 fold at direct contact with feeder layer, about 7 fold in a transwell system and 6 fold in basic medium. No substantial differences in the grade of expansion was revealed in heterologous vs homologous co-cultures of HSPC/WJ-MSC. Noteworthy is that in the contact system in addition to the fluctuating CD34+ cells harvested from the medium (floating CD34+ cells), we found approximately 50% of the total CD34+ cells be adherent to WJ-MSC layer, these cells were released only after enzymatic proteolytic treatment. Subtyping the CD34+cell population growing in contact to the WJ-MSC or in the conditioned medium we found that the CD34+/CD133+cell population was maintained high (72% \u00b112 over the total CD34+ cells) as in unmanipulated CB-HSC. The CD34+CD38- cells decreased by 2,5 fold in both systems, as early as day 5 of culture. However, in the contact system this population was 3 times more represented in the attached CD34+ cell fraction. The CD34+/CD90+ subtype was also expanded (more than 8 fold) particularly in the attached fraction, as early as 5 days of culture and was maintained to the end WJ-MSC supported ex-vivo HSPC expansion with superior effect in a cell contact system. Two phenotypically different populations of HSPC developed in this system with an increased frequency of CD34+ cells that co-expressed markers typical of more early progenitors in the attached CD34+ cell fraction. We are assessing the significance of these differences by performing molecular and functional studies of WJ-MSC-supported HSPC.
