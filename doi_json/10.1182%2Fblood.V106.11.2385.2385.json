    "abstract_text": "In order to establish an efficient anti-tumor cellular immunotherapy using blood \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, we investigated the cytotoxic activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells expanded from patients with leukemia against autologous leukemia cells and explored the potent methods for enhancing the anti-tumor cytotoxic activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. We clarified that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells generated from leukemia patients possess the cytotoxic activity against autologous leukemia cells. Besides, anti-tumor cytotoxic activity of expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was enhanced by the short-term culture of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with type I IFN (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2). The sensitivity of target leukemia cells to \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was enhanced by the exposure of the target cells to bisphosphonate such as zoledronate, which is one of the antigens recognized by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and elevates the content of potent antigen for \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, isoprenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), in tumor cells. Blood \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were expanded from anti-CD3 microbead-separated T cells or anti-\u03b3\u03b4 TCR microbead-separated \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the patients with acute myelogenous leukemia by the culture with zoledronate and a low concentration of IL-2 for 1\u20132 weeks. For the activation of expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, cultured \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were exposed with type I IFN for 1\u20133 days. The supernatant prepared from the culture of type I IFN-activated \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was assayed for cytokine (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10) concentration by cytometric bead array. Anti-tumor cytotoxicity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was evaluated by 51 Cr-release assay by using purified \u03b3\u03b4 T cells as effector cells and autologous leukemia cells as target cells. In most patients with acute leukemia, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells could be markedly expanded by the culture with zoledronate and IL-2 and almost all the expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T cells possessed V\u03b42 TCR. Expanded and purified \u03b3\u03b4 T cells derived from the patients with leukemia were demonstrated to be cytotoxic against autologous leukemia cells. By the culture of expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with type I IFN, the expression of the activation marker CD69 and the apoptosis molecule Trail was enhanced at the concentration dependent of type I IFN especially IFN-\u03b2. The expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were shown to produce a remarkable amount of IFN-\u03b3 and a considerable amount of TNF-\u03b1 and the cytokine production was increased by the addition of type I IFN. In addition, the cytotoxic activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was enhanced by incubating target leukemia cells with zoledronate for 1\u20132 days. The present study demonstrated that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells expanded from patient\u2019s blood are cytotoxic to patient\u2019s leukemia cells. It is also demonstrated that there are two methods practically available for enhancing the cytotoxic activity of expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T cells against leukemia cells, one of which is activating \u03b3\u03b4 T cells by using type I IFN, and the other is elevating the sensitivity of target cells by using bisphosphonate. These findings implied the possibility that type I IFN-activated \u03b3\u03b4 T cells could be efficiently applied for cellular immunotherapy in the patients with hematological malignancies who is being administered with bisphosphonate. Moreover, in vivo administration of bisphosphpnate, a low dose of IL-2 and type I IFN could be effective for tumors as \u03b3\u03b4 T cell-based cellular immunotherapy.",
