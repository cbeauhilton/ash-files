    "abstract_text": "Members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine- threonine protein kinases mediate multiple physiological functions including differentiation, growth and survival, invasiveness, angiogenesis and drug efflux. Dysregulation of PKC signaling has been implicated in tumor progression and prompted the development of novel anticancer therapeutics. In multiple myeloma (MM) PKC isoforms are: (1) involved in MM cell apoptosis; (2) associated with VEGF- and Wnt- induced MM cell migration; and (3) controlling shedding of IL-6 receptor alpha. However, to date the potential of targeting PKC signaling sequelae in MM has not been evaluated. Here we investigated the novel orally available protein- kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Enzastaurin (Eli Lilly and Company) for its therapeutic efficacy in MM. We first tested the ability of Enzastaurin to suppress MM cell proliferation in a wide array of MM cell lines. Our data show that Enzastaurin inhibits 3H[dT] uptake in all cell lines tested in a low micromolar range equivalent to the concentration range achieved in the patient plasma during clinical trials. Importantly, Enzastaurin also abrogates MM cell proliferation in a BMSC-MM coculture system. We next sought to determine whether Enzastaurin can inhibit cell survival and found dose- dependent induction of MM cell apoptosis in MM cell lines MM.1S, MM.1R, OPM-1, OPM-2, RPMI-8226, and RPMI-dox40. Moreover, Enzastaurin significantly inhibited VEGF- induced MM cell migration on fibronectin. Importantly, IGF-1- induced MM cell migration was abrogated by Enzastaurin, demonstrating the requirement of PKC. Signaling pathways mediating these effects were next examined: Our data show that Enzastaurin abrogates phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3beta, which is required for MM cell growth and migration. Furthermore, ongoing studies are evaluating the efficacy of Enzastaurin in a murine model of human MM. Taken together, these studies show for the first time the preclinical efficacy of the orally available PKC inhibitor Enzastaurin providing the basis for its clinical evaluation to improve patient outcome in MM."
