    "abstract_text": "Background: BT062 (Biotest AG Dreieich, Germany) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), comprising the anti-CD138 chimerized MAb (nBT062) and the maytansinoid DM4 as a cytotoxic agent. It is designed to bind to CD138 on cancer cells, and then release DM4 after internalization to cause cell death. CD138 (Syndecan-1) is highly overexpressed on various solid tumors and in hematological malignancies, and represents one of the most specific target antigens for identification of multiple myeloma (MM) cells. BT062 was investigated as a single agent and found to have an acceptable tolerability profile and evidence of activity in patients with heavily pretreated relapsed and/or refractory MM (1). Preclinical studies showed enhanced anti-MM activity when BT062 was combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Len/Dex). Based on these data, a Phase I/IIa study in MM was initiated to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BT062 in combination with Len/Dex. Objectives: To determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the recommended phase II dose (RPTD), pharmacokinetics (PK), and anti-MM activity of increasing doses of BT062 (days 1, 8, and 15, every 4 weeks) used in combination with Len (25 mg, daily on days 1-21) and low dose Dex (40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22) in patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM. Methods: This is a prospective, open label, multicenter Phase I/IIa study. The Phase I part includes dose escalation, and the Phase IIa the expansion of the RPTD cohort. Patients aged \u226518 years with relapsed and/or refractory MM who have failed at least one prior therapy were eligible to participate. Prior treatment with Len and/or Dex was allowed. Patients with clinical response (or no evidence of progressive disease) and without unacceptable toxicities were eligible for additional treatment cycles. Patients were enrolled in cohorts of at least 3 at each dose level; DLT in the first cycle triggered cohort expansion. Toxicities were assessed by CTCAE v4 and clinical response was assessed according to International Myeloma Working Group criteria. Results: The maximum administered dose (MAD) was 120 mg/m\u00b2. Two of six patients treated at this dose had a DLT: mucosal inflammation (CTC grade 3) and anemia (CTC grade 3). The MTD was defined as 100 mg/m\u00b2 and selected as RPTD. Additional patients are being treated at this RPTD to further evaluate safety and efficacy. Enrollment into the study is ongoing. As of July 2014, a total of 45 patients had received BT062 at dose levels of 80 mg/m\u00b2 (N=3), 100 mg/m\u00b2 (N=36) or 120 mg/m\u00b2 (N=6). Fifteen patients discontinued study treatment: 5 for disease progression, 7 for adverse events, 1 died (not treatment related) and 2 for withdrawal of consent. The other 30 patients remain on treatment. The median treatment duration was 123 days (range 1\u2013597). The median number of prior therapies was 3 (range 1\u201311). 68% of patients had prior exposure to both Len and bortezomib, 73% of patients had prior Len exposure, and 30% were Len-refractory. According to preliminary data from this ongoing study, about 89% of reported Adverse Events (AEs) were CTC grade 1 or 2. The most common reported AEs were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, and hypokalemia. Amongst the 36 patients across all dose levels currently evaluable for efficacy, the overall response rate (ORR) is 78%; including 1 stringent complete response, 2 complete responses, 10 very good partial responses, and 15 partial responses. Two patients achieved a minor response and 6 patients disease stabilization, resulting in a clinical benefit in 100% of the evaluable patients. The ORR was 83% among the 30 evaluable patients receiving the RPTD. Interestingly, the ORR was 70% among the 23 patients with prior exposure to Len and bortezomib, and among 10 patients refractory to prior treatment with Len. Conclusion: Preliminary data from this ongoing study indicate that BT062 is well tolerated in combination with Len/Dex at dose levels that induce responses in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma, including patients with prior exposure to both Len and bortezomib and patients refractory to prior treatment with Len. Updated results on safety and efficacy will be presented.
