    "abstract_text": "OBJECTIVE: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease, in terms of genetic/molecular abnormalities resulting into marked differences in outcome. We had demonstrated that BAALC expression was of prognostic significance in intermediate-risk AML in the prophase study. MiR-3151 was discovered in intron 1 of BAALC. However, miR-3151 prognostic value has not been examined in Chinese adult de novo AML patients. METHODS: Pretreatment bone marrow samples from 209 adult de novo AML patients were analyzed for miR-3151mRNA expression by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Patients were divided into different groups according to miR-3151 level and were compared for clinical outcome. RESULTS: 73 cases of 92 intermediated cytogenetically AML patients got CR after the first block with a CR rate being 79.3% and the CR rate of total group is 72.7%(152/209). However , 29 cases of the CR patients with intermediated cytogenetically AML relapsed with the relapsed rate being 39.7%. Results showed no statistical difference in CR rate ( 74.0 %vs 71.4 %, P=0. 672 ),relapse rate (36.4 % vs. 48 . 0 %, P=0.14 6 ) and OS (35.4 % vs 40 . 0 %,P=0. 919 ) for 209 AML patients with low miR3151 comparing to those with high miR3151 expression. Patients with low miR3151 had a superior CR rate (88 . 6 %vs 70 . 8 %, P=0.0 35 ), OS (69.9% vs 11.5% P=0.00 0 ) and lower relapse rate(28.2 % vs. 5 2. 9 %, P=0.000 ) than low miR3151 expression in 92 intermediated cytogenetically AML. Conclusion: High expression of miR3151 identifies intermediated cytogenetically AML patients with a unfavorable long-term outcome. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
