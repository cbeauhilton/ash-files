    "abstract_text": "Complete response (CR) is an important objective of autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) in multiple myeloma (MM). In comparison with conventional induction treatments, newer combinations of novel agents may effect increased rates of CR and near CR (nCR), a benefit potentially translating into even higher frequencies of CR/nCR after ASCT and improved clinical outcome. We designed a phase III study to detect an increase in CR+nCR rates from 10\u201315% with conventional Thalidomide-Dexamethasone (TD) to 20\u201330% with Velcade added to TD (VTD) in newly diagnosed MM. Both TD and VTD were given as three 21-day cycles in preparation for double ASCT. In the present analysis, CR+nCR rates by the two induction treatments were examined in relationship to baseline prognostic variables in 399 evaluable pts aged \u226465 years, of whom 199 randomized to VTD and 200 to TD. All analyses were intent to treat. In comparison with TD, VTD effected higher rates of CR+nCR (12% vs 33%, P190 U/L (33% vs 9%, P10 g/dL (P=0.01). In the VTD arm, a positive correlation was observed with del(13) (P=0.006) and t(4;14) (P=0.02). Response to first ASCT with melphalan 200 mg/m 2 could be evaluated in 297 pts, of whom 145 randomized to VTD and 152 to TD. Randomization to VTD was closely associated with increased CR+nCR rates (54% vs 29% with TD, P<0.001) and remained statistically significant (P<0.001) also in the multivariate analysis. Additional factors predicting for superior post-ASCT CR+nCR rates in the multivariate setting included light chain only subtype (P<0.001) and IgA isotype (P=0.005). We conclude that randomization to up-front VTD was the strongest and independent factor associated with increased rates of CR+nCR before ASCT. Superiority of VTD to TD pertained in both low-risk and high-risk sub-groups, including the traditionally unfavorable sub-groups carrying del(13), t(4,14) and del(17p). Remarkably, in the VTD arm improved postinduction CR+nCR rates were significantly associated with the presence of del(13) and t(4;14) in the multivariate analysis. Benefit from VTD vs TD as primary induction therapy translated into significantly improved CR+nCR rates after the first ASCT and remained statistically significant when assessed by multivariate analysis."
