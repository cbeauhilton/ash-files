    "abstract_text": "Abstract 255 Introduction: Standard treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) comprises one or two cycles of chemotherapy to induce complete remission (CR) followed by postremission treatment in order to prevent relapse of the disease (consolidation therapy). In 2003, we initiated a prospective multicenter randomized trial to investigate the impact of different consolidation strategies on long-term outcome in AML patients \u2264 60 years. Consolidation options comprised upfront allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT) in aplasia after induction therapy, autologous SCT, and three cycles of standard high-dose-cytarabine-based consolidation. For patients receiving high-dose cytarabine, the main study aim was to evaluate the benefit of adding additional mitoxantrone and amsacrine to cytarabine consolidation. Design: From 2003 to 2009, 1182 patients (median age, 48 years; range 16\u201360 years) with untreated AML were randomly assigned at diagnosis to different consolidation strategies after classical 7+3 induction. According to the risk-adapted treatment strategy of the trial, cytogenetically or molecular intermediate-risk (IR) and adverse-risk (AR) patients should receive an allo SCT as consolidation treatment if an HLA-identical-sibling donor (IR) or HLA-matched related or unrelated donor (AR) was available. IR and AR patients with no available donor should receive autologous SCT. All favorable risk patients and patients with no available donor were scheduled for high-dose cytarabine based consolidation. Half of the patients were randomized for high dose cytarabine based consolidation. Half of the patients were randomized for high dose cytarabine alone while the other half received high dose cytarabine with the addition of amsacrine and mitoxantrone. Standard chemotherapy consisted of three cycles with high dose cytarabine (2 \u00d7 3 g/m 2 , day 1,3,5) whereas combined consolidation contained two cycles of MAC (cytarabine 2 \u00d7 1g/m 2 , day 1\u20136, mitoxantrone 10 mg/m 2 , day 4\u20136) plus one cycle of MAMAC (cytarabine 2 \u00d7 1 g/m 2 , day 1\u20135, amsacrine 100 mg/m 2 , day 1\u20135). In order to evaluate the effect of the two cytarabine based consolidation strategies, we determined overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) using the method of Kaplan Meyer. Survival distributions were compared using the log rank test. Results: 1182 patients were randomized for further intervention (Arm A+B: n=582, 49.3%; Arm C+D: n=600, 50.7 %). Median follow-up was 41.4 months (95%-CI 39.3\u201343.6). A total number of 375 patients received allogeneic (n=322) or autologous SCT (n=53) and 807 patients were consolidated with cytarabine. Of these patients, 407 were randomized for cytarabine alone and 400were randomized to receive cytarabine plus mitoxantrone and amsacrine (MAC/MAC/MAMAC). Complete remission rate (CR) after second induction therapy was 59.1% (n=698). Between the four arms, there were no significant differences of the CR rates. Five-year OS of patients receiving high dose cytarabine alone was 47.1% (95%-CI 42.0\u201352.2%), for patients receiving MAC/MAMAC as consolidation therapy it was 46.8% (95%-CI 42.3\u201351.3%; p = 0.610). Three-year event free survival (EFS) was also not significant with 30.5% (95%-CI 26.6\u201334.4%) for patients receiving high dose cytarabine alone and 35.6% (95%-CI 31.7\u201339.5%; p = 0.059) for patients receiving MAC/MAMAC. Conclusions: According to our data, the addition of mitoxantrone and amsacrine to high dose cytarabine consolidation confers no benefit for treatment outcome in younger AML patients. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
