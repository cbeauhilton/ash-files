    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2020 Positive regulatory role of Protein Kinase C (PKC) isoforms in platelets have been extensively studied. However, negative regulatory roles of PKCs in platelets are poorly understood. In this study we investigated the mechanism by which PKCs negatively regulate ADP-induced thromboxane generation and identified PKC isoforms involved in this process. Pan PKC inhibition with GF109203X potentiated ADP-induced cPLA 2 phosphorylation suggesting that PKCs negatively regulate thromboxane generation by regulating cPLA 2 activation. Inhibition of PKCs potentiated ADP-induced ERK activation and intracellular calcium mobilization, two upstream signaling molecules of cPLA 2 .These data suggest that PKCs negatively regulate thromboxane by regulating ERK activation and calcium mobilization, which inturn regulate cPLA 2 activation. Pan-PKC inhibition potentiated ADP-induced, P2Y1 receptor-mediated calcium mobilization in platelets independent of P2Y12-receptor. Pretreatment of platelets with GF109203X, a Pan PKC inhibitor, but not Go-6976, a classical PKC isoform inhibitor, potentiated ADP-induced thromboxane generation. Thus, we investigated the role of various novel class of PKC isoforms (nPKCs) in platelets. We have previously demonstrated that nPKC \u03b7, \u03b8, \u03b4 positively regulates agonist-induced thromboxane generation in platelets. Thus, we investigated if the role of nPKC \u03b5 in ADP-induced thromboxane generation using PKC \u03b5 knockout mice (PKC\u03b5 KO). ADP-induced thromboxane generation in PKC \u03b5 KO murine platelets was ten-fold higher than that of wild type platelets. Furthermore, PKC \u03b5 KO mice exhibited shorter times to occlusion in FeCl 3 -induced arterial injury model and shorter bleeding times in Tail bleeding experiments. We conclude that PKC\u03b5 negatively regulates ADP-induced thromboxane generation in platelets and thereby offers protection against thrombosis.
