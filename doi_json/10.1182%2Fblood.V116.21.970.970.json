    "abstract_text": "Abstract 970 The mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR, is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase known to play a role in regulating mRNA translation, cell cycle progression, cell proliferation and apoptosis. As a downstream effector of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway, mTOR is a component of two distinct complexes, TORC1 and TORC2. While TORC1 facilitates cell cycle progression from G1 into S phase by phosphorylating p70S6 kinase and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), TORC2 catalyzes the activating phosphorylation of Akt on Ser 473 , providing a feedback loop for further activation of mTOR. Phase II trials have shown activity of the TORC1-selective inhibitor rapamycin and its analogs in a wide range of lymphoma subtypes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of the dual TORC1/TORC2 inhibitor OSI-027 in human neoplastic lymphoid cells in vitro . MTS assays demonstrated that OSI-027 inhibited proliferation in a wide range of lymphoid lines, including SeAx (Sezary syndrome), DoHH2 (large cell lymphoma), RL (follicular lymphoma) and Jurkat (T cell ALL), as well as clinical lymphoma and T cell ALL samples, with IC 50 values ranging from 0.078 to 10 \u03bcM. Propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometry for subdiploid cells revealed induction of apoptosis within 48 h of treatment with OSI-027 (but not rapamycin) in SeAx, DoHH2, and Jurkat cells. Examination of Jurkat variants with alterations in key proteins involved in the death receptor versus mitochondrial pathway revealed diminished apoptotic responses to OSI-027 when Bcl-2 was overexpressed or caspase 9 was silenced, indicating involvement of the mitochondrial pathway. Immunoblotting for Bcl-2 family members revealed upregulation of Bim and Puma after a 48-hour exposure to OSI-027 but not rapamycin. This upregulation was also seen at the mRNA level, with a 12- to 20-fold increase in Puma mRNA and 4- to 12-fold induction of Bim mRNA. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of Bim and Puma significantly diminished the apoptotic response to OSI-027. Because the Foxo3a transcription factor has been implicated in Bim and Puma expression and is known to be activated when Akt is inhibited, we next examined whether Bim and Puma induction was Foxo3a-dependent. Luciferase reporter assays showed that OSI-027 activated the full-length Puma and Bim promoters and that this activation was diminished when the Foxo3a binding sites were deleted or mutated. In addition, OSI-027 induced nuclear translocation of Foxo3a, while Foxo3a siRNA diminished OSI-027-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Collectively, these results indicate that OSI-027 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a wide range of neoplastic lymphoid cells through a process that involves Foxo3a-mediated upregulation of Bim and Puma. These results also suggest that dual inhibition of TORC1 and TORC2 may be an effective treatment strategy in lymphoid malignancy. Disclosures: Barr: OSI Pharmaceuticals: Employment.
