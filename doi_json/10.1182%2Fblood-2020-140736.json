    "abstract_text": "Background: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an incurable B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma characterized by high refractory occurrence following drug treatment. Despite the encouraging initial MCL tumor response to ibrutinib (IBN), relapse occurs only after few months of treatment due to multiple resistance mechanisms. Thus, the novel therapeutic strategies targeting resistant mechanisms are crucial. Our group has recently shown that among the highly proliferative MCL population, a subpopulation of IBN-R cells exhibits increased OXPHOS activity that is fueled by increased glutaminolysis and rely more on mitochondrial respiration for their grow and survival. The aim of this work was to uncover potential targets responsible for the upregulation of OXPHOS pathway in the refractory/relapsed (R/R) MCL by using multiple biochemical and biological strategies. We focused the present study on glutaminase (GLS), the enzyme that converts glutamine to glutamate, a precursor of \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) that links glutamate to the TCA cycle. Incorporation of \u03b1-KG into the TCA cycle is a major anaplerotic step in proliferating cells and is critical for the maintenance of TCA cycle function. To further demonstrate the reliance of OXPHOS on glutamine anaplerosis, we have further tested the combinatory effects of targeting GLS and OXPHOS using their respective inhibitors, CB-839 and IACS-010759, on tumor killing activity in R/R MCL. Methods: Primary MCL cells from patient leukapheresis or whole blood specimens, as well as established MCL cell lines were used as experimental models of MCL. Metabolomic profiling was used to determine intracellular metabolite fluxes and levels. Cell Titer Glo assay was used to measure cell proliferation/viability after treatment with inhibitors. Annexin V and propidium iodide were used to measure cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest via flow cytometry analysis. Magnetic microbeads-based B-cell isolation method were used for the purification of malignant B cells from patient samples. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate protein level expression. Patient-derived Xenograft (PDX) mouse model created from patients with MCL was used to evaluate the in vivo anti-tumor activity and potential clinical value of GLS and OXPHOS inhibitors. Results: Our recent metabolomic profiling studies have demonstrated that glutaminolysis and OXPHOS are upregulated in IBN-R MCL, manifested by increased glutamine uptake in the ibrutinib-resistant MCL cell lines (p=0.03).Inhibition of glutamine metabolism with the allosteric GLS1-selective inhibitor BPTES resulted in inhibition of cell viability (0.2381uM-9.98uM), indicating that MCL cells are dependent on glutamine metabolism for their proliferation. To corroborate with the above finding, we also presented evidence that GLS1 is highly increased in IBN-R and CART-R MCL patient samples and cell lines confirmed by immunoblotting. Inhibiting of GLS would lead to significant reduction in OXPHOS, mitochondria membrane potential and ATP production, as either single drug or in combination with other targeting agents. To identify a clinical actionable GLS inhibitor for the treatment of MCL, we chose a GLS1 specific inhibitor CB-839 (Selleckchem), currently under several phase II and III clinical trials investigation on solid tumors. Inhibiting GLS1 with CB-839 leads to the decreased cell viability in MCL (0.5626nM-308.4nM). Of note, the treatment with CB-839 to MCL cell lines induces S phase reduction in both Jeko-1 (17.23%) and Z-138 (14.01%), as well as induces significant apoptosis (p=0.013 and p=0.002 in Jeko-1 and Z-138 cells). GLS inhibition will be further explored in the context of mitochondria defect or hypoxia, where OXPHOS maybe deficient. Importantly, while CB-839 is continuing its validation in several solid tumor models, this is the first study providing data on its efficacy in preclinical models of MCL. Conclusion: In conclusion, we report that glutaminolysis and OXPHOS are upregulated in IBN-R MCL that could be partially due to high expression of GLS1. Our preliminary results revealed that the new GLS inhibitor, GCB-839, may present a clinical potential for a new indication and warrants more in-depth investigation. Deciphering the mechanisms involved in MCL metabolic heterogeneity and adaptability during drug resistance development would be crucial to identify key actors enabling MCL cells to escape from therapy.
