    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1988 Background With the utilization of novel agent-based combination therapies and autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) in multiple myeloma (MM), the rigorous response category of stringent complete remission (sCR) in the international uniform response criteria is increasingly becoming attainable. In addition to the standard criteria for complete remission (CR), sCR requires normalization of the free light chain ratio and disappearance of clonal cells as determined by the marrow immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry. We have previously validated the new response category of sCR created in by the International Myeloma Working Group and demonstrated that sCR represents a deeper level of response, translating into a superior OS. Herein we report the survival outcomes of patients attaining sCR or standard CR, from a 2-year landmark after ASCT in a cohort of patients with extended follow-up. Additionally, we report the outcome of patients who remained in sCR for at least 6 months (sustained-sCR) after ASCT. Patients and Methods Maximal response rates of four hundred and forty-five consecutive patients who underwent ASCT within 12 months of diagnosis of MM were determined. The population achieving varying degrees of complete remission (n=237) is the focus of this study. We performed a landmark analysis 2 years after ASCT to ensure that all the patients attaining at least CR had sufficient time to reach the response levels being studied. Patients were categorized as having sustained sCR (sus-sCR) if the duration of sCR was at least 6 months. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan Meier method and the survival curves were compared by log-rank test. Results The median follow-up of the entire cohort was seventy-seven months (95% CI: 73\u201382 months). The sCR rate after ASCT was 24% (n=109). Median time to progression (TTP) of patients attaining sCR was 50 months from ASCT, and median overall survival (OS) is not reached, in contrast to those attaining standard CR (n=37, TTP=20 months, OS=81 months) or near CR/nCR (n=91; TTP= 19 months, OS=60 months, p<0.0001 for both TTP and OS). OS of patients surviving at least 2 years from ASCT ( Figure 1a ) continued to remain superior for those attaining sCR (n=105, median: not reached) versus 70 months for the CR group (n=32; p=0.004). Among patients achieving sCR (n=109), OS of patients with sus-sCR (n= 75) at 6 months from ASCT is not reached (5-year OS=91%, 7-year OS=86%) versus median OS of 66 months (5-year OS=49%, 7-year OS=37%; p<0.0001) for those who had non-sustained-sCR (n=34) after ASCT ( Figure 1b ). Conclusion In our landmark analysis of patients with MM who survived at least 2 years from ASCT, those attaining sCR have a markedly superior outcome compared to those attaining standard CR. However, among patients attaining sCR, those with sustained sCR of 6 months or greater had the best outcome. Myeloma trials reporting response rates should identify patients achieving sCR and CR separately owing to markedly disparate outcomes of the two categories. Figure 1a.
