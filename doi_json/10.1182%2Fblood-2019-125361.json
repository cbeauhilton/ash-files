    "abstract_text": "Objective : Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is a known phenomenon of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However little is known about the incidence of CNS involvement in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as routine lumbar punctures are not done if patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis. Our practice has been to obtain lumbar puncture (LP) at or after complete remission (CR) for patients that present with any one of the following high risk features;hyperleukocytosis with WBC >10,000 or blastic crisis, extramedullary disease,monocytic differentiation. Methods: We reviewed our leukemia database at Mayo Clinic to determine the incidence of CNS involvement in patients with high risk features after due IRB approval. We also compared baseline demographic characteristics, blood counts, cytogenetic risk groups, presence of extramedullary disease, relapse rate ,transplant rate and overall survival (OS) among patients with and without CNS involvement. OS estimates were calculated by Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank testing using JMP v.13. Results: 298 patients with AML were identified with presence of at least 1 risk factor for CNS involvement. The results of LP were only available for 126 (42%) patients. The overall incidence of CNS involvement was 12% (15/126, figure 1). Among the patients with positive disease 3 had CSF examination at diagnosis prior to CR due to the presence of CNS myeloid sarcoma (n=2) and ambiguous lineage myeloid leukemia and were excluded from further evaluation. The incidence of CSF involvement at CR1 was 9.7% (12/123). All patient with CNS positive disease received intrathecal chemotherapy with alternating cytarabine and methotrexate until they cleared their blast and additional 2-4 treatments as per treating physician's discretion .The CNS positive and negative patients were compared and did not show any statistical difference in age, gender, presence of extramedullary disease ,cytogenetic risk group, relapse rate and transplant rate as shown in table1. Molecular data was not available in most of the patients and hence was not included for analysis. The median OS was significantly lower among patients with CNS involvement compared to absence of CNS involvement but was not statistically significant likely due to small sample size (3.9 vs12.8 years (p=0.2), figure 2). The overall CNS relapse rate in patients who did not have a LP done at CR was 5.8%(10/172). Conclusions : CNS evaluation should be done in AML patients with high risk features before declaring CR. CNS disease portends overall a poor prognosis with impaired overall survival and high relapse rate. However the sample size was small and true incidence of CNS disease will need routine diagnostic LP in all high risk patients.
