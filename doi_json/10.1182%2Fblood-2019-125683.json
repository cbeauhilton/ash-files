    "abstract_text": "Background and objective . Specific immunochemotherapy is the standard treatment of patients with Burkitt leukemia or lymphoma (BL/L). The BURKIMAB08 trial showed 3-yr overall survival (OS) probability of 72% (Ribera JM et al, Cancer. 2013; 119:1660-8). However, the toxicity was high, and 11% of patients died in complete response (CR). In the BURKIMAB14 trial, dose-intensity of chemotherapy blocks was reduced in patients \u226455 years who achieved CR, with the aim to decrease the death rate without impact on efficacy. We present the results of this trial in 80 patients with BL/L and compare them with those of the BURKIMAB08 trial. Patients and method . All patients received a pre-phase with cyclophosphamide, prednisone and rituximab. Patients in localized stages (I-II non-bulky) received 4 blocks of immunochemotherapy (A1, B1, C1, A2), with 33% reduction of doses of iphosphamide, methotrexate and ARA-C in patients \u226455 years in CR (assessed by PET-CT) after B1 cycle. Patients in stages III-IV and mature B-ALL received 6 immunochemotherapy blocks (A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2), with the same dose reduction in cycles C1, A2, B2, C2 in patients \u226455 years in CR after B1 cycle. Patients >55 years received reduced intensity chemotherapy (as in BURKIMAB08) in both induction and post-induction cycles. The CR rate, cumulated incidence of relapse (CIR) and OS were analyzed and compared with those from the BURKIMAB08 trial. Results. From 2014-2019, 80 patients with BL/L were enrolled. Median age (range): 48 (17-80) years, 57 (71%) \u226455 years, 61 males (76%), 15 (19%) patients in stages I-II non-bulky and 65 (81%) in stages III-IV, 25 of whom (38%) had mature B-ALL. 18 patients (23%) were HIV positive, 13 (17%) showed CNS involvement at diagnosis and 23 (31%) bulky mass (>10 cm). 45 patients (60%) had intermediate-high or high IPI. All patients in stages I-II non-bulky showed CR. 4/65 patients in stages III-IV or mature B-ALL are receiving induction therapy, 1/65 withdrew the trial, 7/60 (12%) died in induction, 2/60 (3%) were resistant and 51/60 (85%) achieved CR. Of them, 6 relapsed, 3 withdrew the trial and 3 died in CR (one in the group of localized stage). OS probability at 3 years was 74% (95%CI: 64%-84%) (localized stages 100% [NE], advanced stages 68% [56%-80%], p=0.047, without difference in patients in stages III-IV vs. mature B-ALL, Figure 1). Patients >55 years showed a significantly lower probability of OS (61% [41%-81%] vs. 80% [68%-92%], p=0.022, Figure 2). A lower but non-statistically significant OS probability was observed in HIV-infected vs. non-HIV-positive patients (61% [36%-86%] vs. 78% [67%-89%], p=0.310). The CIR for patients in advanced stage/mature B-ALL was 13% (3%-28%)A trend for lower death rate in CR was observed in BURKIMAB14 vs. BURKIMAB 08 trial (3/62 vs. 16/151, p=0.180), without differences in CIR (9% [3%-21%] vs. 12% [6%-20%]) or in OS (74% [64%-84%] vs. 72% [65%-79%], respectively). Conclusions. The results of the BURKIMAB14 trial are promising, especially for patients in localized stages and for those <55 years. The death rate in CR was lower compared with the BURKIMAB08 trial. The reduction of the dose-intensity of chemotherapy in CR patients did not have impact on the CIR.
