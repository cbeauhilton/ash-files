    "abstract_text": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a B cell disorder characterized by constitutive NOTCH1 activation. NOTCH1 mutations are recurrently associated with CLL providing a new clonal marker to track CLL origin. To investigate CLL-initiating cells, we assessed NOTCH1 mutational status and signaling in hematopoietic stem (HSCs) and progenitor cells from CLL bone marrow. We collected a total of 29 bone marrow (BM) samples including 22 CLL patients and 7 healthy donors (HDs). BM cells were sorted into CD34+CD38- HSCs (purity 94.23% \u00b1 3.04% ) and CD34+CD38+ progenitor fraction (98.12% \u00b1 1.34%). While Sanger sequencing analysis of the NOTCH1 failed to detect alterations in CD34+/CD38- HSCs, AS-PCR and Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) indicated the presence of small HSCs mutated clones in 57% of cases. Altogether, these data confirm that NOTCH1 mutation is an early event in CLL hematopoiesis. The analysis of CD34+/CD38+ progenitors detected the NOTCH1 mutation in the majority of samples (66%). The NOTCH1 mutational burden progressively increased along specific stages of HSC differentiation (6.4%\u00b1 4.7 in CD34+CD38- to 14.9%\u00b111.3 in CD34+CD38+CD10+CD19+ cells, 22.7%\u00b16.5 in CD34-CD38+CD10+CD19+ cells and 40.5%\u00b14.3 in neoplastic CD5+CD19+ cells). This suggests that the NOTCH1 lesion is selected and expands during HSC differentiation toward a B neoplastic cell, thus strengthening the hypothesis that the genetic alteration is an initial event associated with the stepwise malignant transformation of CLL. Conversely, CD34+ cells (1x10 6 ) from CLL patients carrying the mutation, when transplanted into NOD/SCID/IL2Rgnull (NSG) mice generated a mature CLL phenotype (the median percentage of CD5+CD19+ cells in hCD45+ cells was 38.5% and 43.8% in BM and spleen respectively) lacking NOTCH1 mutation (as showed by AS-PCR assay performed on enriched hCD45 cells). This data is more in line with the hypothesis that this genetic abnormality is acquired at the mature B cell stage as an additional leukemogenic event to transform into clinical CLL. Thus, we analyzed the NOTCH1 signaling status in HSCs and progenitor cells of NOTCH1-mutated and unmutated CLL samples. The flow-cytometric analysis of the active NOTCH1-ICN protein level showed unmutated and mutated CLL has a significantly higher NOTCH1-ICN level than HDs samples in both CD34+/CD38- HSCs and CD34+CD38+ (73.4%\u00b122.9 and 83%\u00b116.4 vs 33.3%\u00b114.8; 94.4%\u00b17.3 and 92.8%\u00b14.3 vs 47.9%\u00b113.8, p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). c-MYC expression was found significantly higher in HSCs cells from NOTCH1 mutated and unmutated CLL samples compared to HD (3.5\u00b10.7 and 2.6\u00b10.08 vs 1.3\u00b10.1). Western blot analysis of the expression levels of the NOTCH1-TM subunit revealed that HSCs from mutated and unmutated CLL patients always expressed the NOTCH1-TM protein, compared to HDs where NOTCH1-TM was either absent or expressed at lower levels. The present study indicated that the pool of CD34+ cells, including HSC and progenitor compartments, have NOTCH1 aberrantly expressed and activated in CLL patients compared to HDs demonstrating a common nonmutational NOTCH1 activation occurring early in CLL hematopoiesis. This selective pressure might contribute to the onset of specific NOTCH1 mutations in a DNA context that is prone to spontaneous microdeletion. These data represent a rationale for the use of therapies targeting the NOTCH1 signaling in CLL aimed to inhibit the survival of CLL-initiating cells.
