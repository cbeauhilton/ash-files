    "abstract_text": "Abstract 972 Successful treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is frequently hindered by development of resistance to conventional chemotherapy resulting in disease relapse and high mortality. High expression of anti-apoptotic and/or drug transporter proteins induced by oncogenic signaling pathways has been implicated in the development of chemoresistance in cancer. However, the cellular mechanisms responsible for drug resistance and treatment failure in DLBCL are poorly understood and their elucidation could lead to development of new therapeutic approaches. Activated Hedgehog (HH) signaling was identified in our laboratory to contribute to DLBCL cell survival and proliferation. We also found that inhibiting HH signaling resulted in decrease of BCL-2 protein and mRNA levels in ABC DLBCL cells but not in GC DLBCL cells, and that the resistance to apoptosis to HH inhibition observed in GC DLBCL cells can be overcome using the BCL2 inhibitor YC137. (Leukemia 2010;24:1025). We also found that the drug transporter protein ABCG2 is a potential prognostic factor in DLBCL given that its expression (as detected by immunohistochemistry) inversely correlated with overall survival and failure-free survival (Mod Pathol 2009;22:1312). Here, we investigate potential mechanistic connections between HH signaling and chemoresistance in DLBCL. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), site directed mutagenesis and luciferase reporter based assays, we confirmed the presence of a GLI-1 transcription factor-binding site in the ABCG2 gene promoter and we established ABCG2 gene as a direct downstream target of HH signaling. We also characterized the baseline expression and functionality of ABCG2 in DLBCL cell lines and explored the role of stroma in modulating its expression levels as well as the expression of other drug transporters (MDR1 and ABCC1) and the levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins, BCL-2, BCL2A1 and BCL-xL. Co-culturing DLBCL cell lines (BJAB and DOHH2) with human bone marrow stromal cells (HS5) resulted in decreased chemosensitivity to doxorubicin and methotrexate that was associated to marked increased expression levels of the drug transporters ABCG2, MDR1 and ABCC1 as well as of the expression levels of BCL2, BCL2A1 and BCL-xL. Our results also showed that pharmacologic inhibition of the activity of ABCG2, using fumitremorgin C and glefanine, significantly increased the chemosensitivity of BJAB and DOHH2 cells in the presence of stromal cells. However, this effect was not seen in the absence of stromal cells. Collectively, our data confirm that the stromal cells plays a role in inducing chemoresistance in DLBCL and that this effect is in part mediated by inducing high expression of drug protein transporters and antiapoptotic proteins. Inhibition of HH signaling as well as inhibition of drug transporters abrogates the stroma-induced chemoresistance suggesting that targeting these molecules may have a therapeutic value for the treatment of DLBCL.
