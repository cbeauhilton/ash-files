    "abstract_text": "Introduction. Exon 12 mutations of the JAK2 gene have been described in polycythemia vera (PV) and idiopathic erythrocytosis (IE) patients. These patients display a clinical phenotype different to that observed in V617F-positive PV patients, but no information is available on their clinical outcome. Patients and methods. Twenty JAK2 V617F-negative PV or IE patients and 86 V617F-positive PV patients were assessed for exon 12 and exon 14 mutations. Analysis of cell lineage mutational status was assessed following cell sorting. Aim. To analyze the presence of JAK2 mutations at exon 12 and 14 in a cohort of V617F-negative PV and IE patients and to correlate them with the patient clinicohematological and evolutive data. Results. Exon 12 mutations were detected in 4 (20%) V617F-negative patients (K539L, two cases, N542_E543del and H538_K539delinsL, one case each). In 16 patients, no mutations were found in either exon 12 or exon 14. Additional mutations in exon 14 were found in two V617F-positive patients. Two patients with exon 12 mutations developed thrombosis after diagnosis, with the probability of thrombosis-free survival being 75% at 5 years. Another patient with exon 12 mutation developed myelofibrosis at 20 years of PV diagnosis. JAK2 mutations were present in granulocytes, platelets and monocytes, but not in lymphocytes or NK cells. Conclusions. Patients harboring exon 12 mutations represent a subset of JAK2 V617F-negative PV or IE patients. These patients have initial hematological data different from V617F-positive patients, but they do not differ with regard to thrombosis development and myelofibrotic transformation.
