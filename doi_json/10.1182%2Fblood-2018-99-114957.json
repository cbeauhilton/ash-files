    "abstract_text": "Background and Objectives Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a B cell lymphoma characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells. HL comprises 1% of all cancer cases and 14% of all lymphoma cases. The clinical presentation and survival rate of these patients have not been described in Oman. We, therefore, aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and survival rate of patients with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. Methods This is a retrospective study that was conducted in a tertiary care centers in the Sultanate of Oman. All Omani adults with histopathological confirmed diagnosis of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma from 2000 to 2016 were included in this study. The demographic, clinical, and survival rate were recorded and analyzed. Results A total of 273 patients (45 % females and 55% males, mean age 32) fulfilled the inclusion criteria with histopathological confirmed diagnosis of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. The commonest presenting feature was lymph node enlargement (83%); followed by fever (48%). The most common classical HL histological subtype was nodular sclerosing HL (NSHL) (71%). The most common stage was II 34%. The most common chemotherapy regimen used as the first line was doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD) (89%). Five and 10-year survival rates were 93.8 % and 99.2%, respectively. Conclusions This is the first study that demonstrates the demographic, clinical and survival rate of HL patients in Oman, and provides a general picture of the HL patients in our country.
