    "abstract_text": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disease marked by bone marrow failure, congenital defects, and cancer. In spite of the identification of at least 8 genes, the biochemistry of the disease and its normal pathway in the cell remains elusive. The FA core complex is composed of at least 5 proteins, 2 of which, FANCA and FANCG, we have shown to be phosphorylated. In these studies, we show that both FANCA and FANCG are phosphorylated in response to DNA damage. In the case of FANCG, we have mapped the site of this phosphorylation to serine 7, using a phosphoserine 7 FANCG antiserum. Because of the link of FA function and the FA core complex-dependent monoubiquitination that occurs both as a result of DNA damage as well as at S phase, we also examined if phosphorylation occurred at S phase as well. While FANCG serine 7 phosphorylation occurs both at S phase and after DNA damage (similar to FANCD2 monoubiquitination), FANCA phosphorylation occurs only after DNA damage. Recent data have implicated the kinase ATR as important in the pathway. In order to assess whether a downstream target of ATR is differentially phosphorylated in FA cells, we tested the phosphorylation status of chk1 in FA-A mutant and corrected cells. Chk1 kinase is phosphorylated at serine 318 in response to DNA damage only in corrected cells but not mutant FA cells, while signaling through chk2 kinase is unaffected. These data suggest the importance of phosphorylation in the FA pathway in the regulation of both cellular responses to DNA damage as well as engagement of the cell cycle.",
