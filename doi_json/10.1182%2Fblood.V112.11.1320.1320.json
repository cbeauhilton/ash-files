    "abstract_text": "To investigate the anxiety and depression of parents whose children suffered from leukemia and to develop a set of theoretical guidance for later psychologic intervention, parents of leukemia children treated in Beijing Children\u2019s Hospital (BCH) from March of 2004 to March of 2006 were evaluated with Family Environment Scale (FES) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) questionnaires. They were tested in three phases relating to three groups: parents of newly-diagnosed-children group, parents with or without psychological intervention groups. Parents in intervention group were given individual psychotherapy, group therapy or systemic family therapy. A total of 353 questionnaires were analyzed, including 138 in newly-diagnosed-children group, 103 in intervention group and 112 in non-intervention group. Results showed: The family environment scores of expressiveness, independence, achievement, cultural, recreational orientations and organization were significantly lower, but the scores of conflict, ethics religion and control were much higher in parents of newly-diagnosed-children group than the normative population. For example, the scores of expressiveness and conflict were 4.9 and 2.3 in normative population, but the scores were 2.3 and 3.9 in parents of leukemia children. The HAD scores of parents of newly-diagnosed-children group showed that the scores of anxiety and depression were 38.4% and 24.1% higher than the baseline value respectively. The scores of parents\u2019 cultural, recreational orientations and independence increased to normal level in six months after their children received treatment; Fathers\u2019 conflict score decreased to normal level in intervention group (3.0) compared to non-intervention group (4.4). The scores of parents\u2019 anxiety and depression reduced to baseline six months after their children received treatment. We concluded that the psychologic distress of parents was influenced tremendously by their leukemia children. At the beginning of diagnosis their anxiety, depression and conflict were significantly elevated. Most parents could cope with their leukemia children by timely and effective psychological supports. Professional psychological intervention is most helpful in reducing family conflicts.",
