    "abstract_text": "Alpha thalassemia is the most common globin gene disorder in the world and the disease is caused by mutations in either the alpha2 or alpha1 genes. Deletions of one (-\u03b1) or both (--) of these genes are the most common cause of alpha-thalassemia, while point mutations and small insertions/deletions are present but at a much lower frequency (5%). The number of point mutations described in these genes has been steadily increasing, with greater than 40 identified to date. Identifying these point mutations acquires importance as patients with non-deletional hemoglobin (Hb) H disease are more severely affected. Comprehensive evaluation of \u03b1 globin genes is also essential while determining the molecular basis of the thalassemia intermedia phenotype. Mutations in the alpha globin gene can be detected either by direct DNA sequencing or by screening methods. Although small (about 1kb, 3 exons and 2 introns), the alpha-globin genes are duplicate and highly G-C rich, which makes them difficult to denature and therefore reducing sequencing efficiency and causing frequent artifacts. We have developed a simple and robust method based on mismatch-specific DNA endonuclease, Surveyor TM Nuclease. Genomic DNA control samples (n=21) harboring 12 different nucleotide changes characterized by direct DNA sequencing in either the alpha2 or alpha1 samples were used to validate this method. These samples were heterozygous or homozygous for each point mutation, or compound heterozygous for a deletion and the point mutation. Controls were amplified by gene specific primers designed by Primer3 software followed by digestion with Surveyor TM Nuclease. This endonuclease is a member of the CEL nuclease family of mismatch-specific nucleases derived from celery. It recognizes all insertions, deletions and base substitutions, and cleaves the mismatch of any heteroduplex DNA. After digestion, cleavage products are analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The size of the digestion products indicates the location of the mutation, which is then confirmed and characterized by sequencing. All the 12 different nucleotide changes [\u03b11 CD 14 Ta\u0300C, \u03b12 CD 104 Ta\u0300G, \u03b12 IVS II-55 Ta\u0300G, \u03b11 IVS II 141 Ta\u0300C, \u03b11 IVS I 117 Ga\u0300T, \u03b12 IVS I 1 Ga\u0300A, Poly A (-AA), \u03b11 CD 119 Ca\u0300T, \u03b12 IVS I 116, \u03b12 CD 22 Ca\u0300T, \u03b12 CD 29 Ta\u0300C, \u03b12 +15 Ca\u0300G] in the alpha globin genes were detected by this assay indicating a high sensitivity and specificity of this method. Mutation screening by Surveyor TM Nuclease is rapid (~ 5 hours), cost effective ($8/sample) and sensitive (100%). This assay in combination with the multiplex-PCR for screening the common alpha globin gene deletions will be the most comprehensive and economical approach for genetic diagnosis of alpha thalassaemia. Mismatch specific nucleases may have increasing application as a mutation detection strategy for human genetic diseases.",
