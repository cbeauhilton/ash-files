    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3973 Poster Board III-909 Purpose Somatic mutations of Kit have been found in leukemias and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The proto-oncogene c-Cbl negatively regulates Kit and Flt3 by its E3 ligase activity and acts as a scaffold for several signaling adaptor molecules. We recently identified the first c-Cbl mutation in human disease in an AML patient, called Cbl-R420Q. Results We transduced primary murine bone marrow retrovirally with c-Cbl mutants and transplanted it into lethally irradiated mice. Almost all recipients of bone marrow cells transduced with Cbl mutants developed a lethal hematologic disorder with a mean latency of 341 days in the Cbl-R420Q group and 395 days in the Cbl-70Z group. Eleven out of 13 mice and 8 out of 11 mice died in the Cbl-R420Q group and Cbl-70Z group, respectively. Two animals succumbed to a myeloid leukemia, the other mice developed a myeloproliferative disease. The leukemic mice showed a leukocytosis of up to 140.000/\u03bcL. They developed a splenomegaly with massive expansion of myeloid cells in liver and spleen. Histology sections of spleen, liver and bone marrow and FACS analyses of spleen, bone marrow and peripheral blood showed extensive infiltration of myeloid cells. Conclusion Thus, transplantation of bone marrow cells expressing Cbl mutants leads to a myeloid leukemia or to a myeloproliferative disease with long latency and high penetrance.
