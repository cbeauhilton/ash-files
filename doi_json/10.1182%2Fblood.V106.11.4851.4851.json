    "abstract_text": "CFSA, an 18-year-old woman with a history of weight loss and abdominal discomfort was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in December 2002. The WBC were 440 x 10 9 /L with 25% neutrophils, 20% bands, 9% metamyelocytes, 9% myelocytes, 8% promyelocytes, 10% basophils, 9% eosinophils, 1% lymphocytes and 8% blasts. The hemoglobin was 9,8 g/dL and platelet count 416 x 10 9 / L. A bone marrow examination demonstrated granulocytic hyperplasia and the presence of Philadelphia chromosome in 100% of the metaphasis. A diagnosis of CML was made and she was started on hydroxyurea and imatinib 600mg daily. No matched HLA donor was found. There was a partial hematological response. In February 2005 on imatinib (600 mg) she was pregnant and an ultrasound scan showed a viable fetus of 17 weeks. The WBC were 22 x 10 9 /L with 50% neutrophils, 23% bands, 8% metamyelocytes, 12% myelocytes, 1% promyelocytes, 5% lymphocytes, hemoglobin 11,4 g/dl and platelet count 290 x 10 9 . Imatinib was stopped and she remained off treatment during pregnancy. Cesarean section was performed at 38th week because of preeclampsia (hypertension, headache and scotomas). A healthy girl weighing 2980 g, 46,5 cm in length with Apgar score of 9 was delivered. The infant\u2019s physical examination, WBC, hemoglobin, platelet count and cranial ultrasonography were normal. The baby is presently healthy with no developmental abnormalities. There are few reports on the use of 600 mg a day of imatinib and pregnancy. It is of notice, although probably unrelated, the event of preeclampsia. The effects of imatinib on fetus are unkown and should be considered teratogenic until more studies or cases are reported.",
