    "abstract_text": "In vivo selection of gene modified hematopoietic stem cells permanently increases the relative proportion of blood cells that carry a therapeutic transgene despite initially low gene transfer efficiency, thereby decreasing the likelihood of insertional mutagenesis and avoiding the need of myeloablative conditioning regimens. P140K Mutant O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) enzyme confers resistance to the combination of the MGMT inhibitor O(6)-benzylguanine (O(6)BG) and nitrosourea drugs such as 1,3-bis-(2 chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU). We have previously shown that reduced intensity and toxicity BCNU/O6-BG selection allows efficient selection of MGMT-P140K expressing oligoclonal murine hematopoiesis. Nevertheless, whether long-term selection and the associated proliferative stress impairs long-term differentiation and proliferation of MGMT-P140K expressing stem cell clones is currently unknown and remains a major concern in the clinical application of MGMT selection. To address this question, serial transplantations of murine MGMT-P140K expressing hematopoiesis combined with repeated administrations of O6-BG and BCNU were done. After ex vivo gene transfer of an MGMT/IRES/eGFP encoding retroviral vector, bone marrow cells were transplanted into syngeneic C57 BL/6J mice and primary, secondary and tertiary recipient mice were subsequently treated every four weeks in order to exaggerate potential effects on long-term clonal behaviour. Lineage contribution of the transduced hematopoiesis was monitored by FACS over a total of 14 rounds of selection and clonality by LAM-PCR over a total of 12 rounds of selection. In primary mice the percentage of transduced blood cells increased from 4.7 \u00b1 0.8 % to 36.4 \u00b1 9.8 % (n=12) and in secondary mice from 29.9 \u00b1 7.2 % to 65.1 \u00b1 8.7 % (n=18) after selection without persisting peripheral blood cytopenia. Lineage analysis showed an unchanged multilineage differentiation potential of transduced cells in 1 st , 2 nd and 3 rd generation animals. LAM PCR analysis of peripheral blood samples revealed stable oligo- to polyclonal hematopoiesis in primary and secondary mice. Evidence for predominant clones or clonal exhaustion was not observed despite up to 12 rounds of BCNU/O6-BG treatment. Interestingly, pairs of secondary transplanted mice that received bone marrow cells from identical donors showed very similar clonal composition, engraftment kinetics under selection and lineage contribution of the transduced hematopoiesis, indicating extensive self-renewal of transplantable stem cells in the primary mice resulting in a net symmetric refilling of the stem cell compartment. In summary, we demonstrate that even extended selection of MGMT-P140K expressing hematopoietic stem cells by repetitive chemotherapy does not affect their differentiation or proliferation potential and does not result in clonal exhaustion. Our results have important implications for the clinical use of MGMT selection strategies for the amplification of a limited number of gene corrected clones in clinical gene therapy.",
