    "abstract_text": "Altered DNA repair mechanisms are responsible for survival of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and/or leukemia progenitor cells (LPCs) accumulating numerous lethal DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). DSBs resulting from stalled/broken replication forks in proliferating cells are primarily repaired by RAD51-mediated homologous recombination repair (HR), which depends on BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2-RAD51 paralogs (BRCA pathway), while RAD52 pathway serves as redundant back-up mechanism. Enhanced self-renewal of LSCs and high proliferation rate of LPCs commit them to HR. It has been reported that inhibition of RAD52 either by the knockout, specific shRNA, or a small peptide aptamer induced synthetic lethality in BRCA pathway-deficient tumor cell lines and primary leukemia cells. Yet pharmacological inhibition of RAD52, which binds single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and lacks enzymatic activity, has not been demonstrated. Here, we applied high-throughput screening and structure-based selection followed by biochemical assays and computer modeling to identify three leading compounds: (1) 20264, (2) RU-0084339, and (3) D-I03. Compound 20264 appeared to interact with the hotspot in RAD52 DNA binding domain 1 to interfere with ssDNA binding. RU-0084339 is a major allosteric inhibitor of RAD52 ssDNA binding domain which disassembles undecamer ring structure of RAD52. D-I03 abrogated RAD52-mediated ssDNA annealing and ssDNA pairing. RAD52 small molecule inhibitor (RAD52smi) reduced recruitment of RAD52 to DNA damage-induced nuclear foci and suppressed RAD52-mediated DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair activity in cells with negligible effects on other DSB repair pathways. Importantly, RAD52smi selectively eliminated cancer cell lines carrying BRCA1/2 inactivating mutations. Since inactivating mutations in BRCA pathway are rare in leukemias, individual BRCA pathway-deficient leukemias were identified by Gene Expression and Mutation Analysis (GEMA). Gene Expression approach applied microarrays, qRT-PCR, and/or flow cytometry to identify individual leukemias displaying downregulation of at least one gene in BRCA pathway. On the other hand, Gene Mutation strategy detected individual leukemias expressing an oncogene causing downregulation of BRCA pathway gene(s) (e.g., BCR-ABL1, MLL-AF9, AML1-ETO - mediated downregulation of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2) and harboring inactivating mutations in BRCA pathway (e.g., BRCA2 = FANCD1, and other FA genes). BRCA-deficient cells from individual patients indentified by GEMA were selectively sensitive to RAD52smi alone or in combination with already approved cytotoxic drugs. RAD52 is a promising new target because it is \"druggable\" by small molecule inhibitors. Moreover, inhibition of RAD52 by genetic knockout and small peptide aptamer did not exert any major negative effects in normal cells and tissues. Altogether, this work provided foundation for precision medicine guided synthetic lethality in BRCA-deficient leukemias exerted by small molecule inhibitors targeting novel mechanism - RAD52 dependent DSB repair.
