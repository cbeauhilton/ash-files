    "abstract_text": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT). CD4+CD25+ T cells are characterized in suppression of autoimmunity and induction of transplantation tolerance. Recently several studies have shown that CD4+CD25+ T cells from donor are able to effectively suppress acute GVHD (aGVHD) in murine models. However the relationship of aGVHD with the levels of CD4+CD25+ T cells in donor and receipients undergoing aHSCT in human is not clear. Here we examined the CD4+CD25+ T cells in both donors and receipients after aHSCT. Methods: donors and receipients were divided into two groups: group 1 without or with grade I aGVHD and group 2 with aGVHD above grade II. Age match with donors and receipients of normal peoples were taken as control separately. aGVHD was diagnosised and graded according to standard criteria. The peripheral blood was obtained from the donors 1 week before aHSCT, and receipients 4weeks after aHSCT for treatment of malignancy, mostly chronic myelogenous leukemia. CD4 + CD25 + T cells and CD4+CD25+ bright were assessed by double color immunoflurecence labeling and FACScan. The ratio of CD4+CD25+ T cells and CD4+CD25+ bright in CD4 T cells was calculated. Results: There is no difference in CD4+CD25+ T cells between normal control and group 1 of the donors who\u2019s stem cells were infused into the receipients underwent grade I aGVHD. CD4 + CD25 + T cells were significantly decreased in group 2 of donors compared to normal control and group 1 of donors (see table 1). CD4 + CD25 + T cells and the CD4 + CD25 bright T cells subpopulations in group 2 of receipients were significantly lower than normal control and group 1 of receipients (see table 2). Summary: the severity of aGVHD is correlated to the levels of CD4 + CD25 + T cells in both donors and receipients after aHSCT. aGVHD occur less in the donor with normal levels of CD4 + CD25 + T cells. Lower levels of CD4 + CD25 + T cells in receipients indicate high incidents of server aGVHD. These data suggested that CD4 + CD25 + T cells could have important role in prevention of aGVHD.
