    "abstract_text": "Purpose: To evaluate the activity and safety of the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat in advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) patients (pts). Patients and Methods: Advanced CTCL pts received oral vorinostat 400 mg daily until disease progression (PD) or intolerable toxicity in this open label Phase IIb trial. Eligible pts must have received \u2265 2 prior systemic therapies which included bexarotene unless intolerable. The planned sample size was \u2265 50 evaluable pts with stage \u2265 IIB. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) as measured by a modified skin severity weighted assessment tool (SWAT). The study would be positive if the ORR in \u2265 stage IIB pts was \u2265 20%. Time to response, time to progression (TTP), response duration (DOR, from time of first response), pruritus relief, safety and gene expression changes were also evaluated. Results: Seventy-four pts (median age, 60 y [range, 39\u201383]; median 3 prior systemic therapies) were enrolled (61 pts \u2265 stage IIB) at 18 centers. Data cut-off was 5/06 with a median follow-up of 10 m. Efficacy data are shown (Table 1). The ORR was 29.5% in \u2265 stage IIB pts. The median DOR and TTP were not reached but estimated to be at least 6.1 m and 9.8 m, respectively, for \u2265 stage IIB responders. Median TTP was 4.9 m for all pts. Overall, 32% of pts had pruritus relief. The most common drug-related adverse experiences (AE) were diarrhea (49%), fatigue (46%), nausea (43%) and anorexia (26%), and were mostly \u2264 grade 2. Seven pts discontinued and 10 had dose modification due to drug-related AE. Drug-related AE \u2265 grade 3 included fatigue (5%), pulmonary embolism (5%), thrombocytopenia (5%) and nausea (4%). Fifteen pts, including 9 responders, were receiving treatment as of 11/05. Three of these pts discontinued due to PD (n = 2) or unacceptable toxicity (n = 1), and 12 have received vorinostat for > 1 y. A pharmacodynamic signature of vorinostat exposure based on gene expression changes was detected. Conclusion: These updated results with additional follow-up continue to demonstrate that oral vorinostat remains effective in advanced CTCL with an acceptable safety profile. Table 1.
