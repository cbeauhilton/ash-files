    "abstract_text": "Background and Aims: Differential expression of molecules in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) might define suitable targets for T cell based vaccines and/or antibody approaches. Methods: We assessed the mRNA expression of the tumor associated antigen (TAA) RHAMM/CD168 defined earlier by serological analysis of cDNA expression libraries (SEREX) from leukemic cells. Results: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 40 B-CLL patients and 20 healthy volunteers (HVs) were examined by quantitative RT-PCR. A leukemia-restricted expression of the antigen RHAMM/CD168 was observed in 39/40 B-CLL patients in contrast to the absence of its expression in HVs. To evaluate the immunogenicity of this novel LAA, mixed lymphocyte peptide cultures (MLPCs), followed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) and flow cytometry assays were performed to detect antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. RHAMM/CD168 specific responses by CD8+ HLA-A2/R3tetramer+CCR7-CD45RA high effector T cells were detected. As these CD8+ T cells contribute to the elimination of RHAMM+ CLL cells, we questioned whether expression of the antigen would be associated with a better survival. RHAMM/CD168 expression revealed to be higher in patients with unmutated IgVH status. RHAMM normalized against the housekeeping gene TATA binding protein (TBP), i.e. the RHAMM/TBP ratio was defined as a prognostic surrogate marker for B-CLL. B-CLL patients with a RHAMM/TBP ratio > 1.67 showed a significantly shorter treatment free survival (TFS) (Fig. 1). A tendency towards higher RHAMM/TBP expression ratios was observed in B-CLL cases with del11q. Conclusion: RHAMM/CD168 is a novel LAA in B-CLL patients, an antigen correlating with the clinical course of the disease. Therefore, we consider RHAMM/CD168 an interesting target for immunotherapy in early stage B-CLL patients, especially with worse prognosis (IgVH unmutated). Figure 1.
