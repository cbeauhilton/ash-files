    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3104 Thalidomide is an active agent in the treatment of MM and shows additive and/or synergistic effects when combined with various chemotherapeutics in pre-clinical and clinical models. We conducted a phase I/II study of Thal in combination with Vel and high dose Mel with PBSCT in patients (pts) with either disease progression or less than complete response after a prior PBSCT. Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of MM and the availability of adequate PBSC. Exclusion criteria were dose-intense therapy within 56 days, uncontrolled infections, uncontrolled CNS metastases, known cardiac amyloid deposition, severe organ dysfunction, Karnofsky score 500/uL 10 days (range, 8\u201314 days), ANC >1000/uL 10 days (range 9\u201314 days), and plt >20,000 12 days (range 9\u201325 days). 28 pts (median age, 56) were enrolled in the phase I and phase II portions of the study. 18 pts were treated for disease progression after prior autologous transplant (median lines of prior therapy =2; range, 1\u20135); only 22% of pts achieved \u2265PR to the most recent therapy prior to PBSCT. 7 pts were enrolled after achieving <CR after prior PBSCT. Restaging evaluation was completed at 1, 2, and 3 months and every 3 months thereafter using the modified IMWG criteria. At three months after PBSCT (compared to immediate pre-transplant) the overall response rate \u2265PR was 44% (1 CR, 4 VGPR, and 6 PR). An additional 10 pt achieved SD and 4 pts experienced disease progression. 4 subjects subsequently underwent allogeneic transplant and are not evaluable for long term response. The median event-free (EFS) was 7 months. The median overall survival (OS) has not yet been reached. The estimated EFS and OS probabilities at 2 years are 5% and 60%, respectably. Our results indicate that high-dose Thal can be safely added up to 1000 mg daily for 5 days to dose-intense Mel and Vel with acceptable toxicities. Confirmation of potential synergistic effects of this combination regimen will require an appropriately designed phase III study.
