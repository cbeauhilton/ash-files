    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4410 Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in heme d egra d ation lea d ing to the generation of free iron, biliver d in an d carbon monoxi d e (CO). In this study, K562 cells were incubate d for 24 h with imatinib (1 \u03bcM) alone or in combination with: 1) cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP, 10 \u03bcM), a potent inducer of HO-1; or 2) tin mesoporphyrin (SnMP, 10 \u03bcM), an inhibitor of HO activity. CoPP was able to overcome the inhibitory effect of imatinib while SnMPP restored the cytotoxicity. Interestingly, neither bilirubin nor CO (using the CO-releasing agent CORM-3) were able to protect K562 cells from imatinib-induced toxicity. The protective effect of CoPP was mitigated by a dd ition of a protease inhibitor (E d 64), which was able to stop HO-1 nuclear translocation. We also analyze d 96 kinase genes an d foun d that addition of CoPP in combination with imatinib leads to at least seven kinases being significantly increased while the expression of these genes was reduced in cells treated with imatinib alone or in the presence of SnMP. All of them are able to activate mitogenic signals. We also found that 1 \u03bcM imatinib was able to increase the formation of cellular reactive oxygen species an d this effect was inhibited by CoPP an d restore d in presence of SnMP. In conclusion, the protective effect of HO-1 on imatinib-induced cytotoxicity does not involve the action of its catabolites, but rather a translocation of HO-1 to the nucleus after proteolytic cleavage. Migration to the nucleus activates several kinases able to in d uce mitogenic signals thus enabling HO-1 to re d uce oxi d ative stress in d uce d by imatinib.
