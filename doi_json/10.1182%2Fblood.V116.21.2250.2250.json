Peripheral blood SC collection could represent a major issue in the use of ASCT in HIV infected patients (pts). Aim: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of SC mobilization in HIV positive (pos) pts with lymphoma and identify factors influencing harvest results. Potential \u201congoing\u201d predictors of collection were also assessed. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analysed 98 consecutive pts with ARL, candidates to ASCT, who underwent SC mobilization at 3 Italian and 2 Spanish centers from 2000 to 2010. A collection less than 2\u00d710 6 CD34+ cells/kg was defined as \u201cmobilization failure\u201d, between 2\u20135 as \u201csuboptimal collection\u201d and more than 5 as \u201cgood collection\u201d. Several parameters were evaluated for correlation with outcome: age, sex, lymphoma histopathology, disease status, WBC and Plt count at start of mobilization, type of mobilizing therapy, marrow disease, previous mobilization failure, n\u00b0 of previous chemotherapy (CT) lines, months from first detection of HIV positivity, CD4 count and HIV-viremia. Moreover, circulating CD34+ and WBC count on the first day of CD34+ monitoring and their ratio (SC ratio = CD34/WBC) were assessed as \u201congoing\u201d outcome predictors. Results: A total of 127 attempts of SC harvest in 98 pts were analysed. Median age was 41.5 ys (28-65). Lymphoma diagnosis was DLBCL in 42% of cases, Burkitt 10%, plasmablastic 10%, HL 31%, anaplastic 5%, follicular lymphoma 1% and PEL 1%. Disease status was complete remission in 36%, chemosensitive disease in 53% and refractory disease in 10% of cases. In 3 cases bone marrow was involved and mobilizations failed. In 18% of cases pts received mobilizing therapy after 1 previous CT line, in 67% after 2 and in 16% after 3 or more. All pts but 2 were on antiretroviral therapy. Median CD4 count was 231/mcl (50-1146) and HIV-viremia was detectable in 22%. Median time from first HIV detection was 79.5 ms (3-295). In 24% of cases G-CSF alone (10-20 mcg/Kg) was used as mobilizing treatment, while CT + G-CSF (5-10 mcg/Kg) in 76%, including single-agent Cyclophosphamide (CTX) 1.5 gr/ms (13%), CTX >3 gr/ms (27%), platinum containing regimens (20%), ifosfamide containing regimens (11%) and others (5%). Mobilization failure occurred in 40% of procedures, a collection between 2\u20135 \u00d7 10^6 CD34/Kg in 24% and > 5 in 35%. Finally, of 98 pts who underwent SC mobilization, 22% failed to collect enough cell to perform ASCT, 12 pts even after repeated attempts, 33% had a suboptimal and 45% a good collection (4 and 5 pts respectively after repeated mobilizations). At univariate analysis failure was significantly associated with refractory disease, Plt < 150.000/cmm, CTX 1.5 gr/ms as mobilizing treatment, previous mobilization failure and circulating CD34+ cell < 7.4/mcl on the first day of monitoring; whereas CTX > 3 gr/ms, CD4 count and SC ratio > 0.002 were associated with a reduced risk of failure. In multivariate analysis refractory disease (p 0.002 (p 3 gr/ms, WBC count and circulating CD34+ cells >29,7/mcl at the first day of monitoring and SC ratio > 0,002, whereas G-CSF alone and previous mobilization failure were negative predictive factors. Multivariate analysis confirmed CTX > 3 (p 29,7 (p=0.0003) and SC ratio > 0,002 (0.0036) as indipendent factors for good collection. Conclusions: In this series of 98 ARL and 127 SC mobilization attempts, a substantial number of pts failed SC harvest (22%) whereas 33% had a suboptimal and 45% a good collection. Lymphoma status and mobilizing treatment seems the strongest predictors for outcome, with refractory disease and low CTX dose (1.5 gr/ms) significantly associated with failure and CTX > 3 gr/ms predictor for good collection. A high ratio between circulating CD34+ cells and WBC on the planned day of first apheresis might represent a useful \u201congoing\u201d parameter to predict the outcome. These data might help to decide the mobilizing strategy in ARL and could provide the framework to rationally explore the use of new mobilizing agents Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
