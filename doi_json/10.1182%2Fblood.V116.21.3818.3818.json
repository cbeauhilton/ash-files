    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3818 Although the adherence to recommended preventive care practices in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survivors is reported to be high, on average 25% of recommended preventive care is not delivered to this vulnerable population. We explored factors associated with lower adherence, with particular attention to modifiable factors, in a cross-sectional study of HCT long-term follow up (LTFU) patients. A 45- item supplementary module with questions about adherence to preventive care guidelines and financial concerns was added to the 236- item questionnaire that is mailed annually to LTFU patients who were alive at least 2 years after their first transplant in our center. 1550 (51%) of 3069 mailed questionnaires were returned. We have previously reported that the median adherence to recommended guidelines was 75%. Among other clinical and demographic factors associated with lower adherence, concern about medical costs and lack of knowledge about recommended tests emerged as major modifiable predictors. Of these respondents, 98% had medical insurance coverage, but 26% reported concerns about medical costs which were reflected by attempts to limit medical costs with one or more potentially deleterious avoidance behaviors (e.g., not taking a prescribed medicine, not having a medical test performed). Twenty-six percent worried that medical expenses would reach their lifetime limit. Only 27% of the respondents reported knowing recommended tests for transplant survivors, even though general guidelines are included with each annual questionnaire. 46% of the respondents indicated a desire to acquire this knowledge while 26% indicated that they relied on their treating physicians to be familiar with recommended guidelines. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed for binary outcomes of \u201cconcerns about medical costs\u201d and \u201clack of knowledge about recommended tests for LTFU patients\u201d (Table). These models showed that concerns about medical costs were associated with lower physical and mental functioning, age less than 65 years, being female and not having chronic GVHD. Males, autologous transplant recipients, allogeneic transplant recipients who did not develop chronic GVHD, and patients surviving more than 15 years after HCT were more likely to report lack of knowledge about recommended tests for LTFU patients. When asked how they wished to receive information about recommended preventive care, patients favored mailed information (64%) over in-person evaluation (24%) or phone calls (27%). These results suggest that provision of comprehensive survivorship care plans might improve adherence to recommended preventive care practices by addressing lack of patient and provider knowledge. The increased support for preventive care by requiring health plans to cover preventive services and eliminating cost-sharing by the recent Affordable Care Act could also improve adherence by addressing financial concerns of this so-called \u2018highly insured\u2019 HCT LTFU population.
