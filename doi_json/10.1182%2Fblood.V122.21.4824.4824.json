    "abstract_text": "Introduction In some bleeding situations, quick reversal of warfarin anticoagulation is important. In the event of a major life-threatening bleeding event, the anticoagulation reversal delay can have an impact on mortality. This study aimed to improve the administration delay when using Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC) for the emergent reversal of warfarin anticoagulation in the emergency department. Methods An audit and feedback quality improvement project was conducted in three phases: a retrospective audit phase, an analysis and feedback phase and prospective evaluation phase. The charts of all eligible patients in a single Emergency Department (ED) in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, who received 4-factor PCC since the introduction of this product in 2009 until October 31, 2011 were retrospectively audited with pre-planned evaluation criteria. The administration delay of PCC was calculated from the time of prescription to the time of administration. After this retrospective chart audit, we determined where improvements could be attained, gave feedback to the ED and the blood bank, and we created an action plan to ensure the timely administration of PCC. The action plan was then implemented in practice to reduce the administration delay. Finally, a six-month prospective evaluation study was conducted to determine if our action plan was followed and improved the administration delays. Results Seventy-seven charts were reviewed in the retrospective chart audit. The mean administration delay was 73.6 minutes (STD [34.1]) with a median of 70.0 minutes (25-75% IQR [45.0-95.0]). We found that this delay was principally due to the following barriers that prevented timely administration of PCCs: communication problems between the ED and the blood bank and reconstitution and delivery inefficiencies. In order to address these barriers, we developed an action plan that involved the following elements: a flowchart to remind all clinicians how to order PCCs and a new delivery method from the blood bank to the ED. During the 6 months following the implementation of our action plan, 39 patients received PCCs and the mean administration time decreased to 33.2 minutes (STD [14.2]) ( p <.0001) with a median of 30.0 minutes (25-75% IQR [24.3-38.8]). Conclusion This audit and feedback quality improvement project involving the development and the implementation of an action plan comprising of a flowchart and a new delivery process reduced the administration time of PCC by more than half. Future studies to measure the impact of implementing a similar audit and feedback process involving an action plan in other centers should be conducted before this type of improvement process is implemented on wider scale.
