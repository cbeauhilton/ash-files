    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2462 Background: Two of the largest trials ever conducted in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have shown that the addition of rituximab to fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide (R-FC) significantly improves outcome. However, myelotoxicity and immunosuppression limit the use of this regimen in patients with impaired performance status and pre-existing co-morbidities, predominantly in the elderly. Chlorambucil (CLB) remains a first-line treatment option for such patients. The use of CLB in combination with R is thus an attractive therapeutic option in view of the potentially increased activity compared to CLB alone and the likely good tolerability. This study was designed to determine whether the R-CLB combination is feasible and beneficial as first-line treatment for elderly patients with CLL and to define the role of maintenance R. Patients and Methods: Between October 2008 and January 2010, 97 elderly patients with untreated CD20+ CLL requiring therapy according to the IWCLL criteria were enrolled into the protocol. CLB treatment was administered every 28 days for up to 8 courses at a dose of 8 mg/m 2 /day p.o. on days 1\u20137 combined with 375 mg/m 2 R for cycle 3 and 500 mg/m 2 for cycles 4\u20138. Responsive patients were randomized to R maintenance (375 mg/m 2 every 2 months for 2 years) versus observation. At baseline, blood samples were taken for FISH analysis, IgVH mutational status and expression of Zap-70 and CD38. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was planned to be evaluated on peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) cells by four-color flow cytometry and, when required, by PCR. The primary endpoint was the overall response rate at the end of the induction phase defined according to the IWCLL 2008 on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (all enrolled patients who received at least 1 dose of R). Secondary endpoints included the adverse event (AE) profile, progression-free and overall survival. Results: These are the data of the planned interim analysis based on the first 54 evaluable patients from 19 Italian centers, including tumor response at the end of the induction phase and safety. The median age of patients was 70.5 years (range 61\u201384): 14.8% were between 61 and 64, 31.5% between 65 and 69, 31.5% between 70 and 74, 16.7% between 75 and 79, and 5.6% were \u226580 years; thus, 53.8% of patients were over the age of 70; 70.4% were males; 25.9% were Binet stage A, 57.4% stage B and 16.7% stage C. The overall incidences of trisomy 12 and abnormalities of 13q, 11q23 and 17p13 were 24.5%, 52.8%, 20.8% and 5.7%, respectively; 7.5% of patients had p53 mutations. Of the 51/54 patients analyzed for the IgVH mutational status, 64.7% were unmutated; of the 53/54 patients studied, 39.6% were CD38+ and 71.7% were Zap-70+. The overall response rate on an ITT analysis was 81.4% (44/54 patients); a CR assessed by CT scan and trephine immunohistochemistry was found in 16.7% of cases (9 patients: 4 in Binet stage A, 3 in stage B and 2 in stage C), a CRi in 3.7% (2 patients), a nPR in 1.9% (1 patient) and a PR in 59.3% (32 patients). Eight of the 9 CR cases were investigated for MRD by flow cytometry and all proved positive: 6/8 had MRD levels <10 \u22123 in the PB and 2/8 in the BM. A progressive disease was recorded in 2 patients (4%) and a stable disease in 2 (4%). Six patients (11%) were not evaluable for response: 1 investigator's decision, 2 AEs (1 R infusion-related reaction and 1 unrelated episode of dyspnea) and 3 SAEs (1 CLB-related anemia, 1 endometrial in situ carcinoma and 1 anaplastic oligoastrocytoma). Seven SAEs occurred in 7 patients during courses 3\u20138. Only 1 SAE was related to treatment (1 CLB-related anemia). The most common toxicities were neutropenia (31.5% of patients, 8.9% of cycles) and thrombocytopenia (14.8% of patients, 5.7% of cycles). Grade III-IV neutropenia was present in 16.7% of patients and in 3.8% of cycles. No grade III-IV infections occurred. A median of 85.4 R-CLB courses was administered with 85.1% of patients completing the planned treatment; 15.3% of cycles needed a CLB dose reduction (12.9% due to toxicity, mainly neutropenia and thrombocytopenia). Conclusions: Overall, the results of the interim analysis indicate that R-CLB is active and well tolerated in elderly patients with previously untreated CLL.
