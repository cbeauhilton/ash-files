    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3276 PARP is activated in response to DNA single strand (SS) breaks and is pivotal to the base excisional repair pathway for chemotherapy-damaged DNA. The orally bioavailable PARP inhibitor V delays DNA repair and potentiates the cytotoxicity of multiple classes of chemotherapy drugs including topoisomerase I inhibitors and platinating agents in leukemia cell lines. A previous clinical trial of T+C yielded promising results in adults with refractory acute leukemia at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of T 1.6 mg/m 2 /d + C 150 mg/m 2 /d by intravenous continuous infusion (IVCI) \u00d7 120 hrs. We are conducting a Phase I dose-escalation trial of V given orally twice daily Days 1\u20138 with T+C given by 120 hr IVCI Days 3\u20137.  . Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML, 33 patients) .

Of 27 pts treated at doses of V 10\u201320 mg orally BID Days1-8 and T 1.0\u20131.2 mg/m 2 /d + C 120\u2013150 mg/m 2 /d for 120 hrs IVCI Days 3\u20137, 8 (30%) have experienced > grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity, 4 (15%) have had grade 4 toxicity and 1 (4%) died from sepsis with multi-organ failure. Overall response rate is 22% (2 CR, 1 CRi, 3 PR), with 4 in relapsed AML, 1 each in refractory AML and refractory ALL. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in pt plasma, marrow supernatant, and marrow blasts demonstrated that V does not accumulate with multiple dose administrations in plasma but does in marrow, is not altered by T or C administration, and is detectable in marrow supernatant and cells. Nuclear staining for phosphorylated histone H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) demonstrated that V 10 mg BID increased DNA damage by > 2-fold in 11/22 (50%) on Day 1 and 13/18 (72 %) on Day 4 after 24 hrs of T+C. A PAR ELISA demonstrated that V suppresses PAR levels to <50% of pretreatment values in 21/29 (72%) blood and 9/13 (69%) marrow samples. The MTD has not been reached and dose escalation is ongoing.
