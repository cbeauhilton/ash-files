    "abstract_text": "Cancer testis (CT)-antigens belong to a class of tumor antigens that are aberrantly expressed in a variety of hematological malignancies including multiple myeloma. Owing to their restricted gene expression, CT-antigens represent potential target antigens for immunotherapeutical approaches such as vaccination and adoptive T cell transfer. As the CT-antigens are self antigens, the majority of CT-antigen-specific autologous T cells display a low avidity T cell receptor (TCR), which often results in a weak tumor recognition efficiency. Our group has been focusing on the isolation of highly avid T cells against CT-antigens that are expressed in multiple myeloma, in particular MAGE-C1, MAGE-C2, and NY-ESO-1. The experimental approach was based on the stimulation of allo-restricted cytotoxic T cells, because highly avid T cells recognizing peptide epitopes in context with foreign HLA-alleles are not depleted in the thymus. HLA-A2-negative T cells were stimulated with HLA-A2-positive allogeneic dendritic cells that had been exogenously loaded with HLA-A2-binding peptides derived from NY-ESO-1, MAGE-C1 or MAGE-C2. Using this technique we were able to isolate allo-HLA-A2-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones with peptide-dominant binding against known and novel peptide epitopes derived from NY-ESO-1, MAGE-C1 and MAGE-C2. The expanded peptide-specific CTL clones lysed HLA-A2-positive myeloma cell lines expressing NY-ESO-1, MAGE-C1 and MAGE-C2, respectively. Of note, the MAGE-C1-specific T cells crossreacted with the corresponding MAGE-C2 peptide due to the existing sequence homology between MAGE-C1 and MAGE-C2. Current experiments focus on redirecting primary T cells toward myeloma cells by retroviral gene transfer of CT-antigen-specific TCRs. The establishment of a set of high avidity TCRs specific for CT-antigens facilitates the development of adoptive transfer regimens based on TCR-transduced T cells for the treatment of multiple myeloma."
