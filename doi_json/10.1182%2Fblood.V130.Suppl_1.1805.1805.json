    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: rDNA transcription is consistently dysregulated in cancer, mediated through oncogenic and tumour-suppressive pathways, and in particular by cMYC 1 . RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcriptional hyperactivity is a consistent feature of many cancers, and has been shown to provide a survival checkpoint in haematological tumour cells 2 . Our laboratory developed CX-5461, a highly selective small molecule inhibitor of Pol I transcription of ribosomal genes 3 , currently in a phase 1 clinical trial in relapsed/refractory haematological malignancies (Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Australia). CX-5461 induces cell death via a p53-dependent nucleolar surveillance response, and a p53-independent nucleolar-specific DNA damage response (DDR), killing malignant cells while sparing normal cells 2,4 . We demonstrated that single-agent treatment with CX-5461 provides a significant survival benefit in murine models of B-cell lymphoma, acute myeloid leukaemia and now multiple myeloma (MM) 2,4-6 . However, despite this improvement, drug resistance eventually occurs, indicating combination drug therapy is essential. AIM: to examine the efficacy of CX-5461 in combination with other agents having proven clinical or promising preclinical efficacy in MM. METHODS: we conducted a boutique, high-throughput screen in human myeloma cell lines of CX-5461 combined with a targeted range of agents. We measured the effect of CX-5461 on proliferation, cell death, cell cycle distribution, biomarkers of DDR and on-target effects. The effect of combining CX-5461 with one candidate, the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) panobinostat, was tested in vivo using both the tVk*MYC murine model of MM 6 and in KaLwRij mice transplanted with 5T33 cells. RESULTS: CX-5461 showed increased anti-proliferative effect and cell death in combination with multiple drug classes. The proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib and the HDACi panobinostat demonstrated the most impressive synergy with CX-5461. Using both the MYC-driven tVk*MYC model and the non-MYC-driven 5T33-KaLwRij models of MM, we showed that CX-5461 with panobinostat provides a significant survival advantage. Prolonged combination dosing in the slower tVk*MYC model did not cause haematological toxicity beyond that seen with single agents. We are currently interrogating the molecular synergistic response of this combination, including p53-dependent and -independent responses, and the ATM/ATR signalling pathway. Ongoing work is investigating the efficacy of the triplet drug combination of CX-5461, panobinostat and carfilzomib, both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: CX-5461 shows increased efficacy when combined with multiple drug classes, with panobinostat and carfilzomib showing the most promise in vitro. Combination of CX-5461 with panobinostat produces a survival advantage in both the tVk*MYC and the 5T33-KaLwRij models of MM. These results will direct the subsequent clinical trial using combination drug therapy.

Combination treatment with CX-5461 + panobinostat gives increased survival in the tVk*MYC model of MM . Mice were transplanted with 3.5x10^5 cells, then treatment was started 49 days post-transplant. Mice were treated with CX-5461 35mg/kg orally weekly and panobinostat 7.5mg/kg IP MWF.
