    "abstract_text": "GNB1 encodes a beta subunit (G\u03b2) of heterotrimeric G proteins, which mediate signals downstream of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). We isolated a somatic mutant of GNB1 (K89E) by functional screening of a cDNA library derived from a blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). A search of cancer genome databases identified recurrent mutations in GNB1 and the highly related protein GNB2. GNB1/2 K89E/T were found in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) (1 case), follicular lymphoma (1) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (1) as well as BPDCN (1). Interestingly GNB1 K57E/T mutations were found only in myeloid diseases: [acute myeloid leukemia (2), atypical CML (2), polycythemia vera (1) and MDS (6)], while GNB1 I80N/T were found predominantly in B cell diseases [CLL (2), FL (2), DLBCL (1) and MDS (1)]. These mutated codons are all located on the GNB1 protein surface that is critical for interactions between G\u03b2 and alpha subunits (G\u03b1) or downstream effectors. Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry demonstrated that GNB1 K57E, I80T and K89E mutants failed to bind G\u03b1, including GNAI2/3, GNA11/Q and GNA13 that are normally bound by wild-type (WT) GNB1. All mutations affecting these codons promoted cytokine-independent growth of human TF1 myeloid cells or mouse BaF3 lymphoid cells with activation of MEK/ERK and mTOR/PI3K pathways. Pertussis toxin treatment did not affect GNB1-dependent ERK activation or cell growth, implying a G\u03b1-independent pathway. To investigate the function of GNB1 mutations in vivo, we performed a mouse bone marrow transplantation (BMT) experiment using wild-type and Cdkn2a-deficient donors. Loss of the cell cycle regulator CDKN2A is common in BPDCN, B-ALL, and several other hematologic malignancies. Bone marrow cells were isolated from 5-FU treated donor mice and infected with retrovirus expressing GNB1 WT, K57E, I80T or K89E. Transplantation of GNB1 mutant-expressing Cdkn2a-deficient bone marrow resulted in myeloid dendritic cell neoplasms that were CD11b+, CD11c+, CD19-, B220-, and CD3-. GNB1 mutants did not induce tumors in WT bone marrow after 12 months of observation suggesting that GNB1 requires additional cooperating mutations such as Cdkn2a loss. We performed the same BMT experiment using Cdkn2a-deficient bone morrow cells without 5-FU pretreatment. We found thatGNB1 I80T and K89E mutants induced a progenitor B cell ALL (CD11b-, CD11c-, CD19+, CD3-, TdT+). These data suggest that GNB1 mutations can promote tumorigenesis in more than one cell lineage, as observed in patients. In vivo treatment of the myeloid neoplasm with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 suppressed GNB1-induced signaling and markedly increased survival. In several human tumors, we noted that GNB1 mutations co-occurred with oncogenic kinase alterations, including BCR/ABL, JAK2 V617F and BRAF V600K. Co-expression of patient-derived GNB1 alleles with the mutant kinases resulted in relative resistance to treatment with the corresponding kinase inhibitor in each context. Thus, GNB1 and GNB2 mutations confer transformation and targeted therapy resistance across a range of human tumors and may be targetable with inhibitors of PI3K/mTOR signaling.
