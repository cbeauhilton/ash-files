    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5140 Persistent paraprotein production in plasma cells necessitates a highly developed rough endoplasmic recticulum (ER) that is exquisitely sensitive to perturbations in protein synthesis. Targeting ER stress- related signaling has been clinically validated in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) as evidenced by the response to treatment with bortezomib (BTZ). Despite impressive response rates, BTZ carries the potential for serious side effects, and the development of resistance to BTZ is a clinical issue. We therefore sought to identify novel drug combinations that effectively generate ER stress. Here, we report that sulforaphane, a naturally occurring isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables, synergistically enhances the cytotoxicity of arsenic trioxide (ATO), an agent that has shown clinical activity in MM, in a panel of MM cell lines. As single agents, both 1 \u03bcM sulforaphane and 0.5 \u03bcM ATO have a modest effect on cellular proliferation in a panel of MM lines. However, when the agents are administered in combination, cellular proliferation is dramatically reduced. For example, in PCNY-1 MM cells, 1 \u03bcM sulforaphane has no effect and 0.5\u03bcM ATO causes a 29% reduction in proliferation. However, when administered together, the agents enhance growth inhibition to 73%, with a CI of 0.632 indicative of synergy. Four out of 5 MM cell lines tested displayed sulforaphane and ATO synergy. Combination treatment resulted in enhanced apoptotic induction as demonstrated by cleavage of PARP. Enhanced induction of ER stress signaling and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) upon combination treatment was demonstrated by enhanced expression of the molecular chaperone HSP90 along with increased phosphorylation of PERK (an ER transmembrane kinase and proximal effector of the UPR) and eIF2 (translational initiation factor). Additionally, increased splicing of XBP1 (a transcription factor of UPR target genes) was apparent upon combination treatment as compared to treatment with either agent alone. Our results show that sulforaphane can synergistically sensitize MM cells to the cytotoxic effects of ATO through promotion of ER stress generating mechanisms. Based upon these promising results, further evaluation of this safe, natural product as an ATO sensitizer in a clinical trial of MM patients is warranted. Additionally, this approach holds the promise as a means to identify and clinically validate natural products effective in the treatment of MM and/or inhibition of progression of asymptomatic MM.
