    "abstract_text": "Introduction Chromosome instability (CIN) is a driver of copy number aberrations (CNAs) in cancer, and is a major factor leading to tumor heterogeneity and resistance to therapy. By definition, CIN is an increased rate or ongoing acquisition and accumulation of CNAs and not simply the existence of structurally and numerically abnormal aneuploid clones. In multiple myeloma (MM), the most common whole-chromosome CNAs involve either hyperdiploid or non-hyperdiploid clones. Secondary segmental CNAs are associated with high-risk (HR) in MM and involve gains of 1q21 and deletions of 17p (del17p). These types of intra-chromosomal segmental CNAs are also found in the CIN phenotypes of the autosomal recessive (AR) chromosome instability syndromes. These syndromes include Fanconi anemia, Bloom's syndrome, and ICF syndrome (Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability and Facial anomalies). These chromosome instability syndromes display a spectrum of aberrations characterized by higher rates of chromosomal breaks, chromatid exchanges, quadriradials, and pericentromeric aberrations. In particular, patients with ICF syndrome show a marked increase of 1q12 pericentromeric instability including 1q12 decondensation, triradials, multibranched chromosomes 1q, and 1q micronuclei. ICF patients also show transient 1q aberrations including isochromosome 1q (iso1q) and unbalanced translocations of 1q to 9q and 16q. In MM, we have previously reported increasing pericentromeric instability during tumor progression resulting in increasing CNAs of 1q21 by unbalanced jumping translocations of 1q12 (JT1q12). Strikingly, in a subset of MM patients with 1q21 CNAs of \u2265 5 a distinct cytogenetic phenotype emerges which demonstrates transient 1q12 aberrations including 1q12 decondensation, triradials, and multibranched chromosomes 1q morphologically identical to those seen in ICF patients. In MM this chromosome instability leads to a cascade of increasing clonal 1q21 duplications, iso 1qs, and unbalanced 1q translocations with 16q and 17p, resulting in losses in these receptor chromosomes (RC) and massive intra-clonal CNA heterogeneity. Methods To investigate the cytogenetic impact and progression of high CNAs of 1q21, we performed a comprehensive metaphase analysis of 50 patients showing segmental aneuploidies with 4 or more copies of 1q by G-banding. Locus specific FISH and spectral karyotyping were used to identify the key transient unstable and clonal structural aberrations of 1q12 resulting in segmental aneuploidies in the derivative RCs. Probe for 1q12 (Vysis) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Locus specific BAC clones for 1q21 (CKS1B) and 17p (TP53) were prepared and analyzed as previously described (Sawyer et al., Blood 123: 2014). IGH translocations were investigated with IGH break apart probes (Vysis). Results Data for 50 patients including CNAs of 1q21 of \u2265 4, IGH translocations, del(17p), derivative RCs, are presented. The t(4;14) was found in 15 patients, del(17p) in 23, and both aberrations were found in 8 patients. All patients showed unbalanced gains of 1q and deletions of RCs, the most frequent being 7 patients with der(1;16) and 6 with iso1q. In four of the 23 patients with del(17p), the deletion was due to a JT1q12 to 17p. Seven patients with 1q21 CNAs of \u2265 5 showed profound instability involving the 1q12 satellite DNA, demonstrating both transient and clonal aberrations driving the 1q21 CNAs. These aberrations included unstable 1q21 triplications, JT1q12s, iso1q formation with intra-arm 1q12 CNAs, and region specific breakage-fusion-bridge cycle amplifications. Conclusions Among patients with \u2265 5 CNAs of 1q21, a subset develop an acquired HR chromosome instability phenotype with an elevated rate of 1q12 pericentromeric instability characterized by concomitant deletions in 16q, iso1q, del(17p), and intra-arm segmental instability. These patients show pronounced instability in the 1q12 satellite DNA, morphologically identical to ICF syndrome, suggesting hypomethylation of this region as a driver of both 1q21 CNAs and deletions in RCs. We hypothesize that region specific hypomethylation of 1q12 provides the genomic background for the onset of an acquired 1q12 chromosome instability phenotype in MM similar to that found in ICF syndrome. For myeloma patients demonstrating this 1q12 chromosome instability phenotype we propose the term \"jumping 1q syndrome.\" Disclosures Epstein: University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences: Employment.
