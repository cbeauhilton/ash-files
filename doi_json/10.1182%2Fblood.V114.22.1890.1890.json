    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1890 Poster Board I-913 Background. Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterised by a proliferation of predominantly megakaryocytes and granulocytes in bone marrow that in fully developed disease is replaced by fibrous tissue. At molecular level, no specific defect has been identified yet. Cytogenetic abnormalities occur in up to 30% of patients, the commonest including del(13)(q12-22), der(6)t(1;6)(q21-23;p21.3), del (20q), and partial trisomy 1q. In addition, approximately 50% of patients with PMF exhibit a single, recurrent, somatic mutation in the gene encoding the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Janus kinase 2 ( JAK2 ). However, such mutation is not specific, also occurring in other MPN. Recently a couple of reports dealt with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array karyotyping of MPD, including some PMF. Importantly, such studies could identify previously uncovered genetic lesions, highlighting the importance of novel high resolution technologies for the detection of formerly unknown, cryptic aberrations. In this study we performed high resolution karyotyping by SNP oligonucleotide microarray by using the most updated Affymetrix array (Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0) in 20 cases of myelofibrosis (MF) in order to identify novel cryptic genomic aberrations. Methods. DNA (500 ng) was extracted from peripheral blood cells (PBMNC) of 14 primary and 6 secondary MF patients. PBMNC were depleted from lymphocytes by magnetic beads. Briefly, CD3 + cells were labeled with anti-CD3 MoAb directly coupled to magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech), washed and subsequently purified using Mini-MACS technology. After selection, cell present in the positive (CD3) and negative (PBMNC) fractions were counted and submitted to flow cytometry analysis. DNA was processed and hybridized to the Affymetrix SNP arrays 6.0 as for manufacturer instruction. A whole-genome copy number variation (CNV), genotyping, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and uniparental disomy (UPD) analyses were performed using the Partek Suite 6.0. Ten lab-specific as well as 90 HapMap samples relative to Caucasian healthy donor were used as control reference. Genomic abnormalities were defined as recurrent when occurring in at least 25% of cases. JAK2 mutational status was assessed as reported, by alle-specific PCR. Clinical information and complete follow up were retrieved for all cases. Direct sequencing, FISH, qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been chosen for validation. Results. In all patients we could detect several CNV. The median number of CNV was 60 (range, 34-72), including 46 amplifications (A) and 14 deletions (D). All commonest previously described abnormalities were detected. In addition, several formerly uncovered recurrent lesions were identified, mainly involving 1p, 1q, 2p, 4p, 4q, 5q, 6p, 6q, 7q, 8p, 9q 10q, 11p 11q, 12p, 14q, 15q, 16p, 16q, 17q, 18q, 19q, 20p, 22q. The median size of such CNV was 424,582 Kbp (1,379 Kbp-71,277 Mbp). We then compared JAK2 + vs. JAK2 \u2212 cases. Of note, we found numerous definite aberrations (A or D) distinguishing the two groups and specifically affecting 16q23.1, 1p36.13, 3q26, 14q13.2, 5q33.2, 6q14.1, 7q33, 8p23.1, and 9p11.2. Grippingly, several genes of potential interest for PMF pathogenesis were identified within the involved loci, including RET , SCAPER , WWOX and SIRPB1 . Among others, the product of such genes has been selected for validation by IHC. Similarly, many miRNA were recognized, which may deserve further investigation. Conclusions. By using a newly developed highly sensitive array we identified novel cryptic lesions in patients affected by MF. Future studies on larger series, as well as functional analyses will definitely assess their role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Of note, consistent differences were recorded in JAK2 + vs. JAK2 \u2212 , supporting the hypothesis of different genetic mechanisms occurring in the two sub-groups.
