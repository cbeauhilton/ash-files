    "abstract_text": "PURPOSE An increased incidence of lymphoma is seen in various types of immune deficiency syndromes,including congenital immune deficiency diseases, organ transplantation with iatrogenic immunosuppression and autoimmune disorders. Prognosis of the lymphomas secondary to immunodeficiencies is stil poor. We aimed to analyse clinical features and treatment results of our patients that diagnosed as lymphoma and have immundeficiency syndrom. PATIENTS Between 2002-2014, we have seen 12 (7male, 5 female) childhood lymphoma that related immunodeficiencies. Ages of patients were between 4-15 years (median 8 years).The follow up period is 1-140 months (median: 38.5 months) and survival rate is %58. Five of patients died because of the progressive disease. The characteristics of patients are summarized in the table. TABLE- Clinical characteristics of patients  . Patient . Age (year) . Gender .

One of 2 common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) patient diagnosed as HL and the other one diagnosed T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma (TCRBCL). Wiscott-Aldrich syndome (WAS), autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS ) and selective immunoglobulin A deficiency patients diagnosed as large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), T-cell NHL and HL, respectively. In one patient, EBV associated BL developed secondary to renal transplantation. Another EBV associated BL patient has been diagnosed recently who has DNA instability defect. Follow-up period of patients were between 1-140 months (median 38.5 months). Almost half of the patients ( 42%) were diagnosed as BL,BCLL or TCRBCL. Although, survival of our patients for median 38.5 months is 58% (5 patients died with progressive disease) ,four of the 5 BL&TCRBCL patients have been died. Two patients who are living after BL and BCLL diagnosis in that group are treated with Rituximab as first line therapy. CONCLUS\u0130ON BL is most common lymphoma type in immundeficient lymphoma patients which may be subject for future research . Although special attention has been given to these patients, especially survival of BL lymphoma secondary to immunodeficiencies are poor. Special treatment modalities, like targeted terapies may be necessary as first line therapy to improve survival of these patients. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
