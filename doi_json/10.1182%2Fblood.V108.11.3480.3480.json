    "abstract_text": "Fenretinide (4HPR) is a relatively safe neoclassical retinoid analog that inhibits growth of various tumors through increased intracellular ceramide and ROS, induction of tumor cell apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis. 4HPR has been successfully tested as a chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent in clinical trials on various malignancies. In contrast to retinoic acid, 4HPR induces cell apoptosis rather than differentiation and shows synergistic responses with chemotherapeutic drugs in different tumor cell types. The biological effect and therapeutic value in multiple myeloma (MM) has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-MM effect and mechanism of action of 4HPR using 3 stroma-dependent and 2 stroma-independent MM cell lines established in our laboratory, CD138-selected primary MM cells and co-culture systems of these cells with human osteoclasts and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as previously described (Yaccoby et al., Cancer Res 2004). MM cell apoptosis detected by annexin V flow cytometry and TUNNEL, tumor growth by MTT assay, changes in caspase 3, 8 and 9 activity using Western blotting and ROS production by 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H 2 DCFDA) dye assay. 4HPR inhibits growth of all tested MM cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The IC 50 after 48 hrs in serum-containing media was 10 \u03bcM using MTT assay. 4HPR (3 \u03bcM) increased percent of apoptotic MM cells by 2.5\u00b10.4 folds (p<0.01). Co-culture of these cell lines with osteoclasts only partially protected MM cells from the proapoptotic effect of this drug. Furthermore, 4HPR also induced apoptosis of primary CD138-selected MM cells co-cultured with osteoclasts or MSCs, and inhibited growth of bortezomib-resistant MM cell lines. In contrast, 4HPR had only minimal cytotoxic effect on blood mononuclear cells and MSCs. The proapoptotic effect of 4HPR involved increased level of ROS by 2.55\u00b10.67 folds in MM cells (p<0.01). We also detected reduced levels of procaspase and increased cleaved caspase 8, 9 and 3 within 24 hrs of incubation with this drug. Sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P) partially protected MM cells from 4HPR-induced apoptosis suggesting that, as reported for other tumors, anti-MM mechanism of this drug involved increased intracellular ceramide. 4HPR significantly inhibited tube formation by HUVEC in a matrigel assay (p<0.0001), confirming its anti-angiogenic potential. This drug also effectively prevented formation of multinucleated osteoclasts in culture of human osteoclast precursors with RANKL and M-CSF (p<0.0001). Furthermore, mature osteoclasts viability as assessed by MTT assays was reduced following incubation with 3 \u03bcM 4HPR (p<0.0001). We conclude that 4HPR is a potent anti-MM agent, affecting growth of MM cells in their microenvironment directly through induction of apoptosis in mechanisms involving ROS, caspase and possibly ceramide, and indirectly through inhibition of angiogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. Our data also suggests that S1P, which is highly produced by activated platelets, is an important survival factor for MM cells. Study is underway to test anti-MM efficacy of 4HPR in the SCID-hu model for primary myeloma."
