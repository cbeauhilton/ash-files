    "abstract_text": "The phase II \u201cBologna 2002\u201d clinical study incorporated thalidomide-dexamethasone (thal-dex) into double ASCT with melphalan (200 mg/m 2 ) as frontline therapy for patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM) and less than 65 years of age. By study design, thal (200 mg/d) and dex (40 mg/d x 4d every month, with two added courses on the 1 st and 3 rd month of therapy) were administered from the outset until the second ASCT. An analysis was performed on 311 consecutive patients who entered the study from January 2002 to March 2006 and were followed for a median of 32 months. On an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, the \u2265 very good partial response (VGPR) rate increased from 29% after 4 months of primary induction therapy with thal-dex to 63% after the second ASCT. Transplantation-related mortality after first and second ASCT was 1% and 3%, respectively. Median durations of relapse-free survival (RFS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 52 and 42 months, respectively. The 5-year projected overall survival (OS) rate was 70%. A case-match comparison of 135 of these patients with an equal number of pair mates who entered the \u201cBologna 96\u201d study and were randomly assigned to receive double ASCT without thal showed significant benefit from incorporation of thal into double ASCT in terms of increased \u2265VGPR rate (68% vs 49%, respectively; P=0.001) and extended RFS (54% vs 32% at 5 years; P=0.005) and EFS (median: 52 vs 33 months; P=0.01). All 311 patients were screened on purified CD138+ bone marrow plasma cells for the presence at diagnosis of chromosome 13 alterations [del(13)] (47% of cases) and t(4;14) (13% of cases). In a logistic regression analysis, neither del(13) nor t(4;14) adversely influenced response (\u2265VGPR) to primary induction therapy with thal-dex. At the opposite, both absence of del(13) (P=0.001) and low beta2- microglobulin (beta2-m) levels (P=0.007) were significantly related to attainment of \u2265VGPR after the second ASCT. In a multivariate analysis of all 311 patients, the most important variable significantly extending time to progression (TTP), EFS and OS was the absence of del(13) (P=0.001, P=0.001 and P=0.007, respectively), along with attainment of \u2265VGPR after the second ASCT. OS was also significantly influenced by both beta2-m (P=0.044) and hemoglobin (Hb) concentration (P=0.05), whereas platelet count was an additional prognostic factor for TTP (P=0.025). In conclusion, in comparison with double ASCT, incorporation of thal into double ASCT as up-front therapy for MM significantly improved the response rate (\u2265 VGPR), RFS and EFS, without adversely affecting postrelapse OS. The presence of del(13) by FISH analysis was the most important and independent variable adversely influencing attainment of \u2265 VGPR, EFS and OS following thal-dex and double ASCT."
