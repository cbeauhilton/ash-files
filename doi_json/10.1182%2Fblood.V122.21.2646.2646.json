    "abstract_text": "Background Pediatric non-Down syndrome acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (non-DS-AMKL) is a biologically and clinically unique subset of acute myeloid leukemia. Though non-DS-AMKL was thought to be a poor prognostic disease with a survival rate of 14-34%, recent improvements of diagnosis and intensive chemotherapy with effective supportive care have increased the rate to 50-70%. Little was known about the specific molecular marker in non-DS-AMKL other than t(1;22)(p13;q13)/ OTT-MAL , however, new diagnostic and prognostic markers have been determined using new techniques such as high-resolution array CGH and next generation sequencing. Recent studies have identified new recurrent cryptic translocations, inv(16)(p13.3q24.3) and t(11;15)(p15;q35), which created CBFA2T3-GLIS2 and NUP98-JARID1A gene fusions, respectively. It has been reported that CBFA2T3-GLIS2 is a novel independent factor for dismal clinical outcome and CBFA2T3-GLIS2 positive cases should be classified as the high risk group, meanwhile, the significance of NUP98-JARID1A is less clear at present. The aim of this study is to identify the more accurate frequency and clinical impact of such fusion genes in non-DS-AMKL, which will dissect the biology of this distinct subtype of leukemia. Methods We analyzed 44 newly diagnosed pediatric non-DS-AMKL cases enrolled in two Japan clinical trials, the AML-99 study and AML-05 study. The median age was 1 year of age, and median white blood cell count at diagnosis was 23 x 10 9 /l. Morphologic classification and karyotyping of the cases enrolled in AML-05 study were centrally reviewed. Molecular characterization included the analyses of CBFA2T3-GLIS2 , NUP98-JARID1A , NUP98-NSD1 , OTT-MAL , MLL-AF9 , MLL-AF10 , MLL -PTD, FLT3 -ITD, KIT , RAS , WT1 , and NPM1 . They were determined by RT-PCR and/or PCR followed by direct sequencing, though only MLL -PTD was determined by MLPA method. Some survival analyses were restricted to the cases enrolled in the AML-05 study. Results CBFA2T3-GLIS2 was identified in 12 cases (27.3%), NUP98-JARID1A in 4 cases (9.1%), and OTT-MAL in 11 cases (25%), MLL-AF9 in 2 cases (4.5%), and MLL-AF10 in 1 case (2.3%). Only CBFA2T3-GLIS2 -positive cases had a high white blood cell count compared with other cases (median, 33x10 9 /l for positive cases vs 20x10 9 /l for negative cases, p =0.0807). Seven of the 12 CBFA2T3-GLIS2 -positive cases died, while 4 of the 11 OTT-MAL -positive cases died. In the AML-05 study, 2-years Overall survival rates (OS) of non-DS-AMKL cases (n=34) were 36.4% for CBFA2T3-GLIS2 -positive cases (n=11) vs 73.9% for negative cases (n=23) ( p =0.0773), and 70.0% for OTT-MAL -positive cases ( n=10 ) vs 58.3% for negative cases ( n=24 ) ( p =0.75). Regarding NUP98-JARID1A -positive cases, the number was too small to perform outcome analyses, although 2 cases relapsed and died. Among all cases, 4 of 5 cases with normal karyotype and 5 of 6 cases with acquired 21 trisomy had CBFA2T3-GLIS2 , suggesting that those karyotypes may be useful features to suspect the presence of CBFA2T3-GLIS2 in the cases. Twenty-eight DS-AMKL samples did not harbor any CBFA2T3-GLIS2 , NUP98-JARID1A , or OTT-MAL . Conclusion In addition to well-known OTT-MAL , CBFA2T3-GLIS2 and NUP98-JARID1A are new recurrent fusion genes in pediatric non-DS-AMKL, which demonstrates that pediatric non-DS-AMKL is a distinct subtype of pediatric AML. CBFA2T3-GLIS2 is an independent poor prognostic factor and OTT-MAL may be a relatively good prognostic factor, while the impact of NUP98-JARID1A is still unknown and further investigation is needed. Therefore, routine screening for these fusion genes at diagnosis will be essential for proper identification and stratification of pediatric AML cases.
