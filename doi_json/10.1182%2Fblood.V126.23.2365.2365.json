    "abstract_text": "Background . We identified very primitive CD34-negative (CD34 - ) severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-repopulating cells (SRCs) in human cord blood (CB) using the intra-bone marrow injection (IBMI) method (Blood 2003:101;2924). These CD34 - SRCs possess myeloid-biased differentiation potential, which suggests that they are a distinct class of primitive hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and that they reside at the apex of the human HSC hierarchy (Blood Cancer J 2015:5;e290). We recently developed high-resolution purification methods for CD34 - SRCs using 18 Lineage (18Lin)-specific antibodies, which can enrich CD34 - SRC at the 1/1,000 level in 18Lin - CD34 - fractions (Exp Hematol 2011:39:203). In addition, we previously identified CD133 as a positive marker for CD34 - SRCs as well as for CD34 + SRCs (Leukemia 2014:28;1308). The results showed that CD34 +/- SRCs were enriched to approximately 1/100 and 1/140 in 18Lin - CD34 +/- CD133 + fractions, respectively. Aim . In order to further elucidate the details of the characteristics of human CD34 +/- HSCs, we aimed to identify additional positive markers for the high-level purification of CB-derived CD34 +/- SRCs. Materials and Methods . First, weextensively analyzed the candidate positive markers, including cell adhesion molecules and homing receptors that are expressed on 18Lin - CD34 + CD38 - and 18Lin - CD34 - cells by multicolor FACS. Finally, we discovered that glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein GPI-80, which has recently been reported as a marker for human fetal liver hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) (Cell Stem Cell 2015:16;80), was also expressed on human full-term CB-derived 18Lin - CD34 + CD38 - and 18Lin - CD34 - cells. Next, we sorted 18Lin - CD34 + CD38 - GPI-80 +/- and 18Lin - CD34 - GPI-80 +/- cells from human CB. The HSPC characteristics of the 18Lin - CD34 + CD38 - GPI-80 +/- and 18Lin - CD34 - GPI-80 +/- cells were assessed as follows: (1) the in vitro maintenance/production capacities of CD34 + and CD34 + CD38 - cells were examined in co-cultures with mesenchymal stroma cells (MSCs) established from human bone marrow-derived CD45 - Lin - CD271 + SSEA-4 + cells (Stem Cells 2015:33;1554); (2) an SRC assay was performed using NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2R\u03b3 c null (NOG) mice; (3) limiting dilution analyses (LDAs) were performed to determine the SRC frequencies in these four fractions of cells. Results . In the CB-derived 18Lin - CD34 + CD38 - and 18Lin - CD34 - fractions, 10.1% and 14.4% of cells expressed GPI-80, respectively. The 18Lin - CD34 + CD38 - GPI-80 +/- and 18Lin - CD34 - GPI-80 +/- cells were then co-cultured with human MSCs for 7 days in the presence of SCF and TPO. As a result, the 18Lin - CD34 + CD38 - GPI-80 + cells maintained significantly higher percentages of CD34 + (86.4%) and CD34 + CD38 - cells (24.8%) in comparison to 18Lin - CD34 + CD38 - GPI-80 - cells (78.7% and 14.3%, respectively). However, 18Lin - CD34 - GPI-80 +/- cells produced comparable levels of CD34 + (50.3% and 50.8%) and CD34 + CD38 - cells (4.4% and 5.3%). These four fractions of cells were then transplanted into NOG mice using the IBMI method. All of these four fractions of cells showed long-term repopulating SRC activities with multi-lineage differentiation potential in mouse bone marrow. However, LDAs demonstrated that the frequencies of SRC in the 18Lin - CD34 + CD38 - GPI-80 +/- and 18Lin - CD34 - GPI-80 +/- fractions were 1/21, 1/35 and 1/28, 1/874, respectively. These data clearly demonstrate that both CD34 +/- SRCs are enriched in GPI-80 + fractions. Surprisingly, a number of mice received a limited number of 18Lin - CD34 + CD38 - GPI-80 + (2 cells) and 18Lin - CD34 - GPI-80 + cells (10 cells), and thus also showed multi-lineage long-term human hematopoietic cell repopulation. Conclusion . These observations clearly demonstrated that GPI-80 defines CB-derived human primitive HSCs. Furthermore, these results indicate that GPI-80 is a useful marker for the high-level purification of human CB-derived CD34 +/- SRCs (HSCs).
