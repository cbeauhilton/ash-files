    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1913 Plerixafor (P) is a novel hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilizing agent approved in 2008 to enhance mobilization of HSC when used in conjunction with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). In spite of the enhanced ability of P to mobilize HSC, 25\u201335% of patients (pts) fail to mobilize sufficient HSC when P is used with G-CSF. There is dearth of data on mobilization strategies which could be used after P failure We report our experience of re-mobilizing 24 pts who failed to collect \u22652 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/ Kg in the first mobilization attempt despite use of P. The clinical characteristics of these 24 pts are shown in Table 1 . The median age of the pts was 61 years (range, 31 \u201370) and 14 (58%) were males. Underlying diagnosis for consideration of autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) was non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma (MM) and Hodgkin disease (HD) in 14 (58%), 9 (38%) and 1 (4%) pts, respectively. The median CD34+ cells collected during the first mobilization in these pts using either G-CSF + P (22 pts) or cyclophosphamide (CY) + G-CSF+ P (2 pts) were 0.5 \u00d710 6 CD34 + cells /Kg (range 0\u20131.5). Mobilization outcomes of these 24 patients are shown in Table 2 . Second mobilization was attempted a median of 22 days (range, 15\u2013106) after the first failed mobilization. The agents used were, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) + G-CSF, G-CSF + P, CY + G-CSF and bone marrow harvest in 19, three, one and one pts, respectively. The median CD34+ cell dose collected with the second attempt was 1.1 \u00d710 6 CD34 + cells/Kg (range 0\u20137.2). The median CD34+ cell dose/ Kg collected for the 19 pts who received GM-CSF+ G-CSF and 3 pts who received G-CSF + P were 0.8 \u00d710 6 CD34 + cells/Kg (range 0\u20137.2) and 1.8 \u00d710 6 CD34 + cells/Kg (range, 1.4\u20132.2), respectively; while the two pts who underwent a bone marrow harvest and CY + G-CSF collected 0.9 and 0 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/ Kg, respectively. The cell dose collected when compared to the first attempt was higher in 13 (54%) pts, unchanged in six (25%) pts and lower in five (21%) pts. Third mobilization was attempted in six pts at median of 51 days (range, 34\u2013163) after the first failed mobilization. These pts mobilized a median of 1.1 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/ Kg (range, 0\u20136.5). Three of these pts underwent a bone marrow harvest and collected 0.6, 0.7 and 1.5 \u00d710 6 CD34+ cells/ Kg. One patient each received GM-CSF + G-CSF, G-CSF + P and CY+ G-CSF and collected 6.5, 4.2 and 0 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/ Kg, respectively. The cell dose collected when compared to the first attempt was higher in four pts (17%), unchanged in one patient (4%) and lower in one patient (4%). Total of 18 pts (75%) collected sufficient cells to undergo ASCT and 17 pts have undergone ASCT. All pts except one received all the collected cells. The median CD34+ cell dose for those who underwent ASCT was 2.8 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/ Kg (range, 1.4\u2013 6). The median days to white blood cell and platelet engraftment were12 and 16 days post ASCT, respectively. One patient who received 1.4 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/ Kg did not engraft platelets after ASCT. After failing mobilization with P, nine pts (38%) were able to mobilize \u22652 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/ Kg in a single subsequent attempt which included 7/21 pts who received GM-CSF + G-CSF and 2/4 pts who received G-CSF + P. None of the pts were able to mobilize \u22652 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/ Kg with bone marrow harvest or CY+ G-CSF. Our experience suggests that 75% of the pts who fail primary mobilization with P can be salvaged by a subsequent mobilization with combination of G-CSF with either P or GM-CSF. Table 1.
