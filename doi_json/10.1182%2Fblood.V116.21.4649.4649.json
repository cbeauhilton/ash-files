Methods A real time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Real-time PCR) method was used to detect the expression levels of C/EBP\u03b1 mRNA in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) of 33 patients with MDS and 14 normal controls, Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was established for detecting PU.1 mRNA expression levels in BMMNCs of above-mentioned samples. Results The expression of C/EBP\u03b1 was significantly lower in low-risk and high-risk MDS than those of normal controls ( P <0.01, P <0.001, respectively), moreover, high-risk MDS showed lower C/EBP\u03b1 expression than those of low-risk MDS ( P <0.05). The expression level of PU.1 significantly decreased in low-risk MDS, as compared with normal controls and high-risk MDS ( P <0.001), but there was no significant difference in expression level of PU.1 between high-risk MDS and normal controls ( P >0.05). Conclusion reduced C/EBP\u03b1 and PU.1 expression level have closely associated with the pathogenesis of MDS, they may be important molecular biological markers of MDS; The degree of down-regulated C/EBP\u03b1 has closely related to the progression of MDS, the detection of C/EBP\u03b1 gene expression level may be useful for assessing disease progress and prognostic of patients with MDS.
