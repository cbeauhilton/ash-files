    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2515 Poster Board II-492 Mantle cell lymphoma is a well defined subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by a translocation that juxtaposes the BCL1 gene on chromosome 11q13 (which encodes cyclin D1) next to the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene promoter on chromosome 14q32. The result is constitutive overexpression of cyclin D1 (CD1) resulting in deregulation of the cell cycle and activation of cell survival mechanisms. There are no \u201cstandard\u201d treatments for MCL. Despite response rates to many chemotherapy regimens of 50% to 70%, the disease typically progresses after treatment, with a median survival time of approximately 3-4 years. Mantle cell lymphoma represents a small portion of malignant lymphomas, but it accounts for a disproportionately large percentage of lymphoma-related mortality. Novel therapeutic approaches are needed. In 2007, Nurtjaha-Tjendraputra described how iron chelation causes post-translational degradation of cyclin D1 via von Hippel Lindau protein-independent ubiquitinization and subsequent proteasomal degradation (1). Nurtjaha-Tjendraputra demonstrated that iron chelation inhibits cell cycle progression and induces apoptosis via proteosomal degradation of cyclin D1 in various cell lines, including breast cancer, renal carcinoma, neuroepithelioma and melanoma. Our preliminary data show similar findings in mantle cell lymphoma. To establish whether iron chelation can selectively inhibit and promote apoptosis in mantle cell derived cell lines, the human MCL cell lines Jeko-1, Mino, Granta and Hb-12; the Diffuse Large B cell lymphoma line SUDHL-6; and the Burkitt's Lymphoma lines BL-41 and DG75 were grown with media only, with two different iron chelators (deferoxamine (DFO) and deferasirox) at various concentrations (10, 20, 40, 100 and 250 \u03bcM), and with DMSO as an appropriate vehicle control. Cells were harvested at 24, 48 and 72 hours. For detection of apoptotic cells, cell-surface staining was performed with FITC-labeled anti\u2013Annexin V antibody and PI (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Cell growth was analyzed using the Promega MTS cytotoxicity assay. CD1 protein levels were assessed using standard Western blot techniques. At 24, 48 and 72 hours of incubation with iron chelators, the mantle cell lymphoma cell lines showed significantly increased rates of apoptosis compared to the non-mantle cell lymphoma cell lines (p<0.0001 for all time points). DFO and deferasirox inhibted cell growth with an IC 50 of 18 and 12 \u03bcM respectively. All of the mantle cell lines had measurable cyclin D1 levels at baseline. None of the non-mantle cell lines expressed baseline measurable cyclin D1. In the mantle cell lines, cyclin D1 protein levels were no longer apparent on western blot after 24 hours of incubation with chelation. We then added ferrous ammonium sulfate (FAS) to DFO in a 1:1 molarity ratio and to deferasirox in a 2:1 ratio, and then treated the same lymphoma cell lines with the FAS/chelator mixture and with FAS alone for 72 hours. Adding iron to the chelators completely negated all the pro-apoptotic effects that were seen with iron chelation treatment. Treating with FAS alone had no effect on cell growth or apoptosis. Iron chelation therapy with both DFO and deferasirox results in decreased cell growth, increased cellular apoptosis, and decreased cyclin D1 protein levels in vitro in mantle cell lymphoma. The cytotoxic effects are prevented by coincubation with ferrous ammonium citrate, confirming that the effects are due to iron depletion. Proposed future research includes further defining the molecular basis of iron chelation effects; studying these therapies in combination with other cancer treatments both in vitro and in vivo ; and studying iron chelation therapy in mantle cell lymphoma patients. 1.
