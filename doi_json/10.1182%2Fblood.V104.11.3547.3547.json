    "abstract_text": "The gene coding for the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 is induced at the transcription level in differentiating macrophages and in stress response. Interestingly, PU.1 and C/EBP\u03b2, two transcription factors implicated in IL-1\u03b2 gene expression are not induced by stress exposure, while c-Jun is strongly induced. Strikingly, this upregulation of c-Jun is required for IL-1\u03b2 induction, as cells expressing a c-Jun antisense construct fail to respond to stress exposure. We have mapped the induction of IL-1\u03b2 gene expression to its proximal promoter and show that it is mediated by the transcriptional synergy between C/EBP\u03b2, c-Jun and PU.1 via specific DNA binding sites for C/EBP\u03b2 and PU.1 only. To elucidate how PU.1 and C/EBP\u03b2 cooperate with c-Jun at the molecular level, we have optimized a DNA binding assay based on IL-1\u03b2 promoter fragments immobilized on beads to isolate protein complexes from nuclear extracts, which were subsequently eluted and identified by Western blotting. We show that PU.1 or C/EBP\u03b2 alone directly bind this promoter fragment via specific sequences while purified recombinant c-Jun fails to do so. However, the presence of either PU.1 or C/EBP\u03b2 on the promoter allows for a recruitment of c-Jun to the DNA template, mediated by direct protein-protein interaction. Interestingly, the leucine zipper domain of c-Jun is essential for its interaction with C/EBP\u03b2 while dispensable for PU.1 interaction in vitro whereas its basic domain is required for both interactions. Furthermore, we show that PU.1 and C/EBP\u03b2 cooperatively bind the IL-1\u03b2 promoter, resulting in a synergistic recruitment of c-Jun. Finally, we show that the strength of interaction of c-Jun mutants with PU.1 or C/EBP\u03b2 determine the strength of transcription output and c-Jun mutants that fail to associate with either PU.1 or C/EBP\u03b2 are transcriptionally inactive. In contrast, c-Jun mutants exhibiting increased homodimerization are more active that the wild type protein. Taken together, our data suggest that c-Jun homodimers can be targeted to the IL-1\u03b2 promoter in the absence of a specific DNA binding element, and conclude that PU.1 and C/EBP\u03b2 are specifically tethered to the IL-1\u03b2 promoter while c-Jun cooperatively binds these proteins and acts as a transcriptional co-activator. We propose a mechanism based on an initial binding of PU.1 and C/EBP\u03b2 to the IL-1\u03b2 promoter followed by a cooperative recruitment of c-Jun, resulting in transcriptional synergy and IL-1\u03b2 gene expression in stress response.",
