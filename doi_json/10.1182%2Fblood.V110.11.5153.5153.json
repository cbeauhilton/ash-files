    "abstract_text": "The clinical diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP) is a difficult one to make. It is based on clinical criteria, one of which is a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, characterized morphologically by the presence of schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear. The ADVIA 2120 automated hematology analyzer is able to quantify the presence of red blood cell (RBC) fragments. We studied the ability of the ADVIA 2120 to be able to detect RBC fragments in the blood of TTP patients, and the characteristics of all patients in whom RBC fragments were obtained. During the study period, 6 TTP patients were studied. The initial numbers of RBC fragments ranged from 0.02\u20130.05 \u00d7 10 6 cells/\u03bcl. During the course of plasmapheresis, these numbers decreased to 0.00\u20130.02 \u00d7 10 6 cells/\u03bcl, corresponding to a rise in the platelet count.

Four of the samples did not have detectable schistocytes upon visual inspection of the peripheral blood smear. There were 19 samples from 14 patients who had RBC fragment counts \u2265 0.04 \u00d7 10 6 cells/\u03bcl. 19 Specimens with RBC Fragments \u2265 0.04 \u00d7 10 6 /ul  . Hemoglobin . Platelets . RDW .

We conclude that the RBC fragment flag on the ADVIA 2120 is nonspecific. Although it does detect schistocytes in TTP, these are often present in low numbers. Quantitatively, the most numerous RBC fragments are found in diseases with marked anisopoikilocytosis, such as iron deficiency anemia.",
