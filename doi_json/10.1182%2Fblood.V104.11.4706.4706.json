    "abstract_text": "The telomerase activity can be down regulated by arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3 ), which is regarded as an apoptotic induction agent, is confirmed in many kinds of tumor cells. To investigate the mechanisms of telomerase regulation and to explore the correlation of As 2 O 3 inducing apoptosis and telomerase regulation in MUTZ-1 cells, which are established as a high-risk myelodysplasia Cell line that derived from a MDS patient (FAB subtype refractory anemia with excess of blasts), a quantitative assessment of the telomerase activity by TRAP-ELISA and detection of the expression levels of hTERT, TRF1 (TTAGGG repeat binding factor 1), TRF2 (TTAGGG repeat binding factor 2), bcl-2, bax mRNA were performed, together with the assessment of the apoptosis by means of translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) through flow cytometry assay. The results indicated that a typical apoptotic cell group distribution of DNA content was represented in the MUTZ-1 cells after being exposed to As 2 O 3 at the range of concentration from 1\u03bcmol/L to 8\u03bcmol/L in a dose-dependent manner (r=0.736, P<0.001) and time-dependent manner (r=0.674, p<0.05), and the telomerase activity was down-regulated in a time-dependent manner (r=\u22120.976,P=0.024), and the expression level of hTERT mRNA in MUTZ-1 cells was represented in a dose-dependent manner (r=\u22120.892,P=0.042) and time-dependent manner (r=\u22121.000,P=0.04), after the cells were treated by As 2 O 3 at the dosage as above. It was showed that a significant correlation between the decreased telomerase activity and the increased percentage of apoptotic cells in the treated cells (r=0.938,P=0.018), and there was a strong relationship between the telomerase activity and the mRNA expression of hTERT gene (r=0.783,P=0.022). However, As 2 O 3 has no obvious effect on the expression level of TRF1 mRNA and TRF2 mRNA, which were regarded as two telomere-binding proteins. Further findings indicated that the inhibition of telomerase activity in MUTZ-1 cells was accompanied with down-regulated mRNA expression of bcl-2 gene (densitometry readings: 0.255\u00b10.017 vs 0.466\u00b10.069, P<0.05) and decreased ration of bcl-2/bax (densitometry reading ratios: 0.890\u00b10.083 vs 0.546\u00b10.014, P<0.05) at the dosage of 4\u03bcmol/L for 24 hours. These observations suggest that the apoptosis induced by As 2 O 3 on MUTZ- 1 cells might be mediated through the inhibition of telomerase activity regulated by expression of hTERT gene, which implies that may be one of the mechanisms of As 2 O 3 inducing apoptosis in MUTZ-1 cells.",
