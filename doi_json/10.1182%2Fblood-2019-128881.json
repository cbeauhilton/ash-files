    "abstract_text": "T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy that accounts for 10-15% of pediatric and 25% of adult ALL cases. CXCL12 is a CXC chemokine that is constitutively expressed at high levels in the bone marrow. CXCR4 is the major receptor for CXCL12 and is by far the most highly expressed chemokine receptor on T-ALL cells. Two groups recently showed that genetic loss of CXCR4 signaling in murine or human T-ALL cells markedly suppressed their growth in vivo. We previously reported that BL-8040, a potent new CXCR4 antagonist with sustained receptor occupancy, is active as monotherapy against T-ALL in mice. Indeed, a 2-week course of daily BL-8040 resulted in a median reduction in tumor burden of 32.1-fold (range 6.8 to 176) across 5 different T-ALL xenografts. Preliminary data from a clinical trial of BL-8040 plus nelarabine for relapsed T-ALL also suggest therapeutic activity, with a complete remission rate observed in 4/8 patients (50%), which compares favorably to published response rates of approximately 30% with single agent nelarabine. Here, we explore molecular mechanisms by which CXCR4 blockade induces T-ALL death. NOD- scid IL2Rgammanull (NSG) mice were injected with P12-Ichikawa cells, a T-ALL cell line modified to express click beetle red luciferase and GFP. Following T-ALL engraftment, mice were treated with a single dose of BL-8040, and then leukemic cells in the bone marrow harvested 24-48 hours later. Treatment with BL-8040 resulted in a marked suppression of Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting that signaling through CXCR4 is the major source of PI3 kinase pathway activation in T-ALL cells. Surprisingly, treatment with BL-8040 did not affect cellular proliferation, as measured by Ki67/FxCycle Violet staining or by EdU labeling. Moreover, no increase in apoptosis, as measured by annexin V or activated caspase 3 expression, was observed. These data suggest that CXCR4 blockade induces a non-apoptotic cell death. To explore this possibility further, we performed transcriptome sequencing on T-ALL cells recovered from mice 24 hours after 1 dose of BL-8040. A total of 151 differentially expressed genes (FDR of < 0.05% and \u2265 2-fold change) were identified. Gene set enrichment analysis was strongly positive for alterations in oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome biogenesis, and carbohydrate metabolism. Ribosome function was assessed using O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP), which monitors global protein translation. No difference in global protein synthesis in T-ALL cells was observed after CXCR4 blockade in vivo . T-ALL cells are dependent on glutamine as a source of carbon, and PI3 kinase signaling positively regulates glutaminolysis. Thus, we hypothesized that CXCR4 blockade may induce T-ALL cell death by reducing glutamine metabolism. However, treatment of T-ALL cells in vitro with BL-8040 did not alter the cellular levels of glutamine or glutamate, as measured using a commercial bioluminescent assay. Confirmatory metabolic tracing studies using 13 C-labeled glutamine and glucose are in progress. Finally, to explore the reduction in oxidative phosphorylation, we examined mitochondria function using Mitotracker Green. Treatment of T-ALL cells in vitro with BL-8040 for 24-48 hours induced a significant decrease in mitochondria number, suggesting induction of mitophagy. Collectively, these data suggest that T-ALL cells are addicted to CXCR4 signaling in vivo. CXCR4 blockade with BL-8040 induces a non-apoptotic cell death that is characterized by a loss of mitochondria .
