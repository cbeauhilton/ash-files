    "abstract_text": "Human T cell development is characterized by three phases of clonal selection and expansion: (1) \u03b2-selection which occurs independent of ligand recognition; (2) Positive thymic selection resulting in the outgrowth of T cell clones with an intermediate affinity for self-MHC/ self-peptide complexes; (3) Post-thymic antigen-driven expansion. The T cell receptor (TCR) V\u03b2 frequencies in the peripheral blood could therefore be determined by T cell selection and expansion at one or all phases. To determine whether V\u03b2selection patterns originate at the first phase of thymic proliferation we used flow cytometric analysis to quantitate 21 TCRV\u03b2 proteins in peripheral blood T cells of 23 HLA-disparate healthy adults. A common rank order of TCRV\u03b2 allele frequencies was found in both CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets (figure A). We found the same spectrum of HLA-independent TCR V\u03b2 frequencies in three published studies of healthy adults. Furthermore, the percentages of CD4 cells expressing a particular V\u03b2 were almost identical in a total of 151 data points, and was significantly correlated in CD8 cells (R 2 = 0.79; slope 0.61; p < 0.00001). A significant correlation in TCRV\u03b2 allele frequencies in CD4 cells and CD8 cells was identified in all data sets (R 2 = 0.73, slope 0.54, p < 0.00001)(figure B). Individuals over 50 years of age showed a 5-fold increase in variability of V\u03b2 frequency in CD4 cells than younger subjects. The difference in the median values was statistically significant ( p = 0.03) using a permutation test, indicating that post-thymic antigen recognition skewed the mature \u03b1\u03b2 T cell repertoire predominantly in elderly individuals. Our data therefore indicate that the patterns of TCRV\u03b2 protein frequencies are shaped during \u03b2-selection, conserved throughout life and are only weakly modified by antigen-driven thymic and post-thymic selection and expansion. A genetic basis for this underlying TCR V\u03b2 frequency pattern remains undefined since there was no association of TCRV\u03b2 expression frequencies with chromosomal (5\u2032-3\u2032) organization. However, the reproducible pattern of TCR V\u03b2 frequencies between individuals of diverse HLA types and distinct origins suggests that they are determined by a common genetic mechanism.
