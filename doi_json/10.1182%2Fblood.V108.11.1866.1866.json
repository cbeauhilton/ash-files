    "abstract_text": "Patients with T-cell ALL are at increased risk of CNS relapse and require more intensive CNS directed therapy. CRT is considered to be the most effective therapy, but is associated with serious adverse late effects and secondary brain tumors. We evaluated retrospectively, in the context of the ALL-BFM-based protocols, the impact of CRT or extended T.I.T. on outcome within High Risk (HR: Prednisone poor responders) and non-HR (Prednisone good responders) subgroups. In INS 89, modified ALL-BFM 86/90, all Non-HR patients received extended T.I.T (\u00d718) as CNS preventive treatment, and VP-16 was added systemically in between the HD-MTX (5g/m 2 ). In INS 98, based on ALL-BFM 95, VP-16 was omitted and pulses of VCR+DEXA were added in maintenance. Patients with T-ALL Non-HR and WBC >100000, were assigned to receive CRT 12 Gy, following the results of the AIEOP-ALL 91 (Conter J.C.O. 15:2786\u20132790, 1997) reporting inferior outcome in this group when comparing T.I.T only to BFM with irradiation. T-ALL HR patients were treated without modification and were all assigned to CRT 18 or 12Gy. Results: Between 1989 and 2002, 145 T-ALL children aged 100000 (without CNS involvement) 9 patients were irradiated and 18 patients received the Extended T.I.T. These groups had 5 yr EFS of 78%\u00b114% and 76%\u00b110% respectively, and CNS relapse rate 11.1% and 5.6% respectively (p=0.59). In the HR group (34 pts) the 8 patients who refused CRT fared significantly worse than the irradiated patients, with EFS of 38%\u00b117% Vs 73%\u00b111% (p=0.08), and CNS relapse rate of 17% Vs 0 (p=0.14). T-cell ALL Non-HR children (prednisone good responders), in the context of the ALL-BFM intensive protocols and extended T.I.T may not require preventive CRT regardless of their WBC at presentation."
