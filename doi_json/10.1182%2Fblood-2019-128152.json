    "abstract_text": "In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the assessment of post-induction minimal residual disease (MRD) is largely utilized for choosing post-remission therapies aimed at maintaining complete remission (CR) and preventing relapse. This latter is still the major cause of treatment failure in pediatric AML, and even if several efforts have been spent to validate MRD as a prognostic marker, numerous studies demonstrated that MRD negativity cannot be considered a completely reliable surrogate biomarker predicting outcome, since it does not exclude a relapse. The current interpretation is that disease relapse is due to mechanisms leading to therapy resistance mainly depending on driver chimeric or oncogenic protein-coding genes, which are monitored during treatment, and does not consider that chemotherapy resistance may arise from other genetic markers, phenomenon linked to methylation and non-coding RNAs genomic pressure. We, thus, hypothesized that other markers need to be explored to re-interpret leukemia progression. We showed an overall hyper-expression of the lncRNA BALR2 in 132 de novo AML bone marrow samples collected at diagnosis and analyzed the gene expression profile (GEP) of 58 cases. By unsupervised clustering analysis, we produced important advances in identifying BALR2 as a robust novel molecular marker of a new subgroup of AML characterized by a high rate of resistance to induction therapy, independently from the genetic lesions detected at diagnosis and any other prognostic clinical and genetic features. We demonstrated in vitro that BALR2 has a direct role in controlling bi-directionally its own and of its neighbor gene CDK6 promoter activity. This latter finding of high CDK6 expression was shown to sustain its complex with RUNX1 in order to inhibit RUNX1 binding to its target promoters, thus preventing the process of hematopoietic differentiation progression. To support BALR2 as a new proto-oncogene involved in the control of the myeloid differentiation program, we ranked the genes across the expression profile obtaining a signature of 337 transcripts able to cluster CD34+ human stem cell precursors (HSCPs) separately from more mature CD14+ cells. These in silico findings were validated in vitro by showing that, after BALR2 depletion, CD34+ cells had a skewed myeloid differentiation. Furthermore, we found that AML differentiation toward mature myeloid cells with increased phagocytic capacity was obtained through BALR2 level reduction, and enhanced by combinatorial differentiation stimuli. Our findings attribute a distinct role to BALR2 in the block of myeloid stem cell differentiation occurring during leukemogenesis. At the same time, we interrogated GEP ontology, finding that enrichments of genes involved in mitochondrial synthesis pathways were significantly correlated to patients with highest BALR2 levels, and confirmed the same mitochondriogenesis profile in the immature CD34+ HSCPs. We moved to deconvolute this feature and demonstrated that BALR2 , by controlling mitochondria gene balance, was directly controlling the mitochondrial mass, which dramatically decreased after BALR2 silencing, this supporting the hypothesis that BALR2 would maintain mitochondrial functions to confer AML resistance to cytotoxicity. Consistently with this line of reasoning, we inhibited mitochondria by tigecycline, demonstrating that its activity was dramatically strengthened in BALR2 depleted cells, when used either alone or in combination with cytosine-arabinoside (Ara-C). Concomitantly, tigecycline treatment in BALR2 silenced AML cells reduced mitochondria depolarization, and increased the number of differentiated M-CFU colonies formation, confirming that BALR2, together with CDK6, forms novel transcriptional networks to create a circuit able to impair myeloid differentiation and to lower chemo-sensitivity in AML. We speculate that a novel therapeutic window of mitochondrial targeting in defined AML subgroups, identified through assessment of BALR2 levels at diagnosis or persistent MRD levels, could be envisaged to optimize the outcome of childhood AML.
