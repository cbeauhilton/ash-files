    "abstract_text": "Venous thrombi contain high levels of red blood cells (RBC) and fibrin, but little is known about the mechanisms regulating venous thrombus formation and composition. Fibrin acts as a scaffold for leukocytes and platelets that mediate thrombus formation, and cross-linked fibrin networks promote clot stability via their extraordinary extensibility and elasticity. Previous studies have shown that a region of the fibrinogen \u03b3-chain (residues \u03b3390-396) is critical for engagement of the leukocyte integrin receptor \u03b1M\u03b22. Mice expressing a mutant form of fibrinogen with residues 390-396 mutated to a series of alanines (termed Fib\u03b3 390-396A ) exhibit normal fibrin polymerization and normal hemostasis. However, Fib\u03b3 390-396A mice exhibit blunted inflammatory responses and protection from the development of numerous inflammatory diseases (e.g., arthritis, neuroinflammatory disease, colitis). In this study, we analyzed the role of this region of fibrinogen in a stasis-induced model of venous thrombosis. Surprisingly, following inferior vena cava ligation \u2013 a model that produces thrombi independent of leukocyte tissue factor activity \u2013 Fib\u03b3 390-396A mice had 50% smaller thrombi than wild type (WT) mice (9.7\u00b11.3 vs 19.5\u00b11.7 mg, P<0.0003). Reduced thrombus weight was not due to reduced thrombin generation (i.e., TAT levels), and total neutrophil, platelet, and fibrin content within thrombi were similar between groups. Strikingly, Fib\u03b3 390-396A thrombi had significantly fewer RBCs than WT thrombi (16.0\u00b14.1 vs 52.9\u00b15.8 arbitrary units [AU], P<0.0001), and thrombus RBC content correlated positively (R=0.90) and significantly (P<0.001) with overall thrombus weight. To determine the mechanism of decreased RBC presence in thrombi from Fib\u03b3 390-396A mice, we developed an ex vivo whole blood clot retraction assay. Interestingly, although retraction of platelet-rich plasma clots was indistinguishable for Fib\u03b3 390-396A and WT mice (91\u00b11 vs 92\u00b11 %), retraction of whole blood clots resulted in dramatically reduced RBC retention (37.0\u00b18.4 vs 79.0\u00b18.0 % of initial RBCs, P<0.03) and smaller clots (11.6\u00b11.6 vs 53.8\u00b13.6 mg, P<0.003) for Fib\u03b3 390-396A mice compared to WT. Reconstitution experiments showed the mechanism of decreased RBC retention was not due to abnormal RBC function. Microfluidic-based adhesion analyses indicated RBCs adhered similarly to both Fib\u03b3 390-396A and WT purified fibrinogen (65.7\u00b16.4 vs 76.7\u00b114.8 % cell adhesion, respectively, P=0.55), indicating that RBC extrusion did not result from decreased RBC binding to Fib\u03b3 390-396A clots. To test the hypothesis that the Fib\u03b3 390-396A mutation disrupts a specific interaction with the fibrin-stabilizing transglutaminase, factor XIII (FXIII), we analyzed levels of FXIII that co-precipitated with WT and Fib\u03b3 390-396A fibrinogen. Interestingly, despite normal circulating levels of FXIII in Fib\u03b3 390-396A mice, FXIII co-precipitated with WT fibrinogen, but not with Fib\u03b3 390-396A fibrinogen. Compared to WT, plasma clots from Fib\u03b3 390-396A mice exhibited slower FXIII activation (58.3\u00b119.2 vs 12.2\u00b12.5 AU/min [x10 -3 ], P<0.05) and consequently, slower fibrin crosslinking (\u03b3-\u03b3 dimers: 114\u00b114.2 vs 19.5\u00b12.5 AU/min [x10 -3 ], P<0.0001; \u03b1 polymers: 278\u00b152 vs 46.1\u00b111.4 AU/min [x10 -3 ], P<0.002) and reduced elastic modulus (14.1\u00b10.2 vs 7.8\u00b10.6 G\u2019 [Kd/sec], P<0.0005). Provocatively, whole blood from FXIII-deficient mice and humans phenocopied Fib\u03b3 390-396A clots, with reduced RBC retention following clot retraction. Taken together, these studies suggest a critical, yet previously un-described, role for FXIII in mediating RBC retention within clots. Further, these data identify critical residues in fibrinogen that mediate FXIII activation and fibrin crosslinking, and reveal that FXIII-mediated fibrin crosslinking is required for the retention of RBCs in venous thrombi.
