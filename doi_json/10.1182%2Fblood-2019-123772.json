    "abstract_text": "Background : Relapsed/refractory (R/R) large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) is associated with poor outcomes to standard salvage therapy (Crump M, et al. Blood. 2017). In SCHOLAR-1, a large multicenter, patient-level, retrospective study, patients with R/R diffuse LBCL had a 26% objective response rate (ORR) to the next line of therapy, a 7% complete response (CR) rate, and a median overall survival of 6.3 months (Crump M, et al. Blood 2017). Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) is an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy approved for patients with R/R LBCL with \u2265 2 prior systemic therapies. With a median follow-up of 27.1 months in ZUMA-1, the ORR with axi-cel was 83% (58% CR rate) in patients with refractory LBCL (Locke FL, et al. Lancet Oncol. 2019). Activation of the costimulatory receptor 4-1BB (CD137) on CAR T cells may enhance axi-cel antitumor activity by enhancing T cell proliferation, function, and survival. Utomilumab (uto), an investigational monoclonal antibody agonist of the 4-1BB pathway, enhanced T cell function and survival in preclinical studies (Fisher TS, et al. Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2012) and had favorable single-agent safety in patients (Segal NH, et al. Clin Cancer Res . 2018). Possible mechanisms of resistance to axi-cel are thought to be suboptimal CAR T cell expansion an exclusionary tumor microenvironment and CD19 target antigen loss (Neelapu SS, et al. Blood 2017, Rossi JM, et al J Immunother Cancer. 2018). Combination strategies that increase proliferation, expansion, and persistence of CAR T cells or prevent activation-induced cell death of CAR T cells may improve clinical outcomes observed with axi-cel. ZUMA-11 is a Phase 1/2 study investigating the efficacy and safety of axi-cel + uto in patients with refractory LBCL. Methods : The primary objectives of this study are to determine the safety, recommended Phase 2 dosing and timing (Phase 1), and efficacy (Phase 2) of axi-cel + uto in adult patients with refractory LBCL. Patients with progressive or stable disease as the best response to second-line chemotherapy or relapse \u2264 12 months after autologous stem cell transplantation, a prior anti-CD20 antibody and anthracycline-containing regimen, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1 are eligible. Patients with histologically proven primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma, history of Richter's transformation or chronic lymphocytic lymphoma, prior CAR T cell therapy, or central nervous system involvement of lymphoma are ineligible. In Phase 1, \u224824 patients in \u2264 3 cohorts will receive a single dose of axi-cel and escalating doses of uto (10, 30, or 100 mg) using a 3 + 3 design in up to 4 of 6 cohorts. The recommended uto dose will be based on dose-limiting toxicities and other factors. Patients will be leukapheresed and may receive optional, nonchemotherapy bridging therapy per investigator decision. After conditioning chemotherapy, patients will receive a single infusion of axi-cel (target dose, 2 \u00d7 10 6 CAR T cells/kg) on Day 0 followed by uto on Day 1 and every 4 weeks for 6 months or until progressive disease. Patients will be treated one at a time during Phase 1, and patients treated with axi-cel will be staggered by \u2265 2 weeks. Day 21 uto administration will be explored if toxicity is unacceptable with Day 1 administration. The primary endpoints are incidence of dose-limiting toxicities in Phase 1 and CR rate in Phase 2. Secondary endpoints include ORR, duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, safety, and levels of CAR T cells and cytokines in blood. This study uses a single-arm design to estimate the true CR rate; with a sample size of 27 patients, of which \u2264 3 patients will have been treated in the Phase 1 portion, the maximum half-width of the 95% confidence interval about response will be \u2265 21%. ZUMA-11 is open and accruing patients.
