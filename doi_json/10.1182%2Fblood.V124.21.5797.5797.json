    "abstract_text": "Mixed hematopoietic chimerism permits durable tolerance of T, B and NK cells to xenoantigens in a rat to mouse bone marrow transplant model. However, it is unclear whether tolerance of human NK cells to pig xenoantigens can be induced by mixed hematopoietic chimerism. We assessed the tolerance of human NK cells towards pig cells in a humanized mouse model with established pig and human mixed xenogeneic chimerism. Pig and human mixed chimeras (MCs) were generated by injection of pig bone marrow cells to irradiated pig cytokine (IL3, GMCSF and SCF) transgenic NOD-scid common gamma chain knockout (NSG) mice followed by injection of human fetal liver CD34+ cells 3 day later. In the control group, only human CD34+ cells were transplanted. 12 weeks post-transplant, hydrodynamic injection of plasmid encoding human Flt3L followed by injection of three rounds of recombinant IL15/IL-15 receptor alpha Fc complex was given to promote human NK cell reconstitution. The control non\u2013mixed chimeric group (Non-MC) received the same treatment without pig cells. 12 days following induction of human NK cell reconstitution, human NK cells from both MC and Non-MC mice were isolated from the spleen and their cytotoxic responses in vitro to pig cells were determined in a chromium release assay. In addition, the presence of pig cells in various tissues of the chimeric mice was studied. While human NK cells were usually undetectable in peripheral blood prior to the injection of human Flt3L plasmid and IL-15/IL-15 receptor alpha-Fc complex, they were detected by 5 days post-injection of IL-15 protein. 12 days post-induction of human NK cell reconstitution, pig cells remained detectable in peripheral blood, spleen, bone marrow and liver in the chimeric mice together with human NK cells. The co-existence of human NK cells and pig cells suggested that human NK cells in MCs might be tolerant to pig cells. Consistent with this notion, cytotoxicity assays showed that human NK cells from MCs demonstrated decreased killing of pig PBMC blasts compared to NK cells from Non-MC mice. Importantly, killing of K562 cells by NK cells from MCs mice was also decreased compared to that of Non-MC mice, suggesting that human NK cell tolerance to pig cells induced by mixed chimerism was associated with global hyporesponsiveness, as we have previously observed in a rat-to-mouse bone marrow transplantation model. Moreover, higher percentages of CD56 high CD16 low and lower percentages of CD56 low CD16 high human NK cell subsets were observed in bone marrow of chimeric mice than in non-chimeric mice, indicating that the development of human NK cells in bone marrow might be altered by the presence of pig cells. In summary, our data suggest that mixed xenogeneic chimerism may induce tolerance of human NK cells towards porcine cells, but the tolerance may be associated with global hyporesponsiveness.
