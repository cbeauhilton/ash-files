    "abstract_text": "Follicular lymphoma arising in an extranodal site is uncommon and its natural history and treatment is poorly characterized in the literature. We retrospectively reviewed a large cohort of patients with stage I and II follicular lymphoma and analyzed the outcomes of patients with extranodal (EN-FL) presentations to identify sites of involvement and treatment outcome, and compared these to patients with nodal follicular lymphoma. From 1967 to 1999, 668 cases of limited stage follicular lymphoma (stage I and II) were treated at the Princess Margaret Hospital. Of these, 157 cases (23.5%) presented in extra-nodal sites. The most common site of presentation was in the head and neck area (42%) followed by gastro-intestinal tract (14.6%) then skin (10.8%). The majority of patients had stage I disease (61.8%). Pathological type was follicular grade I: 22.9%, grade II: 33.1%, and grade III: 43.9%. Treatment consisted of involved field radiation therapy in 72%, combined modality therapy in 22.3% and chemotherapy alone in 3.8%. The treatment changed over time with increased use of combined modality treatment (CMT) [1967\u201377: 10.5%, vs. 1989\u201399: 33%] mainly due to the adoption of CMT for follicular grade III lymphoma. Overall complete response rate (CR) to primary treatment was 93%; the CR rate for radiation alone was 97.3%. The cumulative incidence of relapse (RR) was 44% at 10 years. The RR at 10 years was higher for patients age >60 (62% vs. 49%; p =0.059) but did not vary according to stage, tumour bulk, gender or histologic grade. For extranodal lymphoma, the 10-year overall survival (OS) rate was 56% and the 10-year disease free survival (DFS) was 42% and was similar for major sites of presentation. Comparison of Stage I\u2013II Nodal and Extra-nodal Follicular Lymphoma  . Nodal Follicular Lymphoma . Extra-nodal Follicular Lymphoma . 10 yr Overall Survival 61% 56% (p=0.97) 10 year Disease Free Survival 41% 42% (p=0.27) 10 yr Relapse Rate 50% 44% (p=0.11) . Nodal Follicular Lymphoma . Extra-nodal Follicular Lymphoma . 10 yr Overall Survival 61% 56% (p=0.97) 10 year Disease Free Survival 41% 42% (p=0.27) 10 yr Relapse Rate 50% 44% (p=0.11) View Large In conclusion, a significant number of patients with localized FL present with extra-nodal disease, involving diverse sites. Patients with EN-FL were more likely to have follicular grade III histology. OS, DFS and RR were similar to nodal follicular lymphoma. These results suggest that the clinical management of stage I and II extra-nodal follicular lymphoma should be the same as for nodal, and that a significant proportion of patients have prolonged DFS with radiation-based therapy.",
