    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Total (-7) or partial (7q-) monosomy 7 is the second frequent abnormality in MDS, occurring in around 12% of MDS/AML and up to 40% of therapy-associated MDS/AML. The present study was designed to analyze clinical features, prognosis and response to different therapeutic strategies in patients with -7 or del(7q) in a multicentric, retrospective cohort study. Patients and Methods: 471 patients with MDS/AML following MDS and monosomy 7 were registered and retrospectively analyzed. The median observation time was 3.6 years. Inclusion criteria were defined as follows: Morphologic diagnosis of MDS/AML following MDS, bone marrow blast count <=30% and presence of -7 or 7q- proved by chromosome banding analysis (CBA) or fluorescence in situ-hybridization (FISH). The data was coalesced from 8 centers in London (n=140; 29.7%), Duesseldorf, (n=120; 25.5%%), Goettingen (n=118; 25.1%), Cologne (n=38; 8.1%), Freiburg (n=29; 6.2%), Munich (n=13; 2.8%), Dresden (n=10; 2.1%) and Mannheim (n=3; 0.6%). The median age in the study cohort was 66 years, 63% of patients were males. MDS/AML was therapy-associated in 53 (11%). According to IPSS-R, 9 (1.9%) were assigned to the low risk group, 39 (8.3%) to the intermediate group, 81 (17.2%) to the high-risk group and 133 (28.2%) to the very high risk group. The treatment was classified as follows: Best supportive care (BSC), low-dose Chemotherapy (LDC), high-dose chemotherapy (HDC), hypomethylating agents (HMA; either 5-azacytidine or decitabine), and others (e.g. valproic acid, steroids, lenalidomide or thalidomide). Survival analyses were performed regarding overall- (OS) as well as AML-free survival (AFS) using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: 147 patients (31.2%) showed 7q-, 313 (66.5%) -7 and 11 (2.3) patients showed both abnormalities at the first cytogenetic examination. The abnormality was detected by CBA\u00b1FISH in 440 (93.4%) and by FISH only in 31 (6.6%). In the latter cases, the CBA was either unsuccessful or showed a normal karyotype. In 182 (38.6%) patients, -7/del7q was detected as a single abnormality, 77 (16.3%) showed two abnormalities and 184 (39.1%) showed a complex karyotype involving -7/7q-. As previously described (Schanz et al., 2012), untreated patients with an isolated 7q- as compared to an isolated -7 show a better prognosis regarding OS (median: 4.0 vs. 0.7 years; p<0.01) as well as AFS (median not reached vs. 2.3 years; p=0.062). Median hemoglobin level in the study cohort was 9.3 g/dl, ANC 0.98*10 3 /\u03bcl, platelet count 73*10 3 /\u03bcl and the median number of bone marrow blasts was 8%. Regarding the treatment, a best supportive care regimen was chosen in 195 (41%) patients. The remaining 276 (58.6) patients received 1-5 sequential therapies (one therapy: 31.6%; more than 1 therapy: 27.0%). 81 patients received an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (ATX). Within the group of patients treated with HMA at any time of their disease (n=167), 147 (31.2%) received 5-Azacytidine, 8 (1.7%) Decitabine and 12 (2.5%) patients were treated with both drugs. As the first line therapy, 122 patients (25.9%) received HMA, 50 (10.6%) HDC, 28 (5.9%) ATX, 28 (5.9%) 11 (2.3%) LDC, and 28 (5.9%) were treated with other therapies. Patients eligible for ATX showed a significantly better prognosis as compared to any other therapy strategy: The median OS in was 2.1 years as compared to 1.1 years in non-transplanted patients (p<0.01). In patients not eligible for ATX, treatment with HMA at any course of their disease as compared to a BSC strategy was associated with a better OS (1.4 vs. 0.8 years, p=0.014). By comparing HMA to any other therapy, the OS did not differ significantly (1.4 years in HMA vs. 1.1 years in any other, p n.s.). In patients classified as very high risk according to IPSS-R, the median OS was significantly prolonged in patients receiving HMA as compared to BSC (1.1 vs. 0.6 years, p<0.01). This was also observed for the risk of AML-transformation in this subgroup of patients: The median time to AML was 1.8 years in HMA-treated patients versus 0.6 years in BSC (p=0.012). Conclusions: To our knowledge, the study describes the largest patient cohort with MDS/AML and monosomy 7 published to date. Further data regarding the clinical characteristics of this subgroup of patients and the treatment regimes applied will be presented in detail.
