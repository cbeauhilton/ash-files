    "abstract_text": "Plasma high molecular weight kininogen (HK) is cleaved in inflammatory diseases by kallikrein to cleaved HK (HKa). We have reported that HKa releases cytokines (TNF\u03b1 , IL-1\u03b2 , IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8 and MCP-1) from isolated human peripheral blood monocytes. At a concentration of 600nM, Glutathione -S- transferase (GST) fusion proteins of kininogen domain 3 (D3), E7P - an active fragment of domain 3 ( aa G255-Q292), HK domain 5 (D5), and D5 recombinant peptide HG (aa K420-D474) each stimulated secretion of IL-1\u03b2 from monocytes. Receptors on monocytes including Mac-1, LFA-1, uPAR and gC1qR are required for IL-1\u03b2 secretion from monocytes. We now report the signaling pathways and evidence for synthesis of IL-1 \u03b2 in monocytes stimulated by HKa. Inhibitors of signaling pathways initiated by NFkB, JNK and p38, but not ERK, decreased IL-1b release from monocytes. A specific inhibitor of NFkB, MG-132 (1, 10 and 100 \u03bcM) significantly reduced IL-1\u03b2 release from monocytes by 69.7, 67.3, 88.5% respectively, when stimulated by GST-E7P. The release of IL-1\u03b2 by LPS (10 \u03bcg/ml), was blocked 83.4% by MG-132 (100 \u03bcM). A specific inhibitor of JNK, SP 600125 (1, 10 and 100 \u03bcM) significantly reduced IL-1\u03b2 release from monocytes by 55.7, 76.3, 78.9% respectively, when stimulated by GST-E7P. The release of IL-1\u03b2 by LPS (10 \u03bcg/ml), was blocked 90.23% by SP 600125 (100 \u03bcM). A specific inhibitor of p38, SB202190 (1,10 and 100 \u03bcM) significantly reduced IL-1\u03b2 release from monocytes by 27.8, 14.2, 91.0% respectively, when stimulated by E7P. The release of IL-1\u03b2 by LPS (10 \u03bcg/ml), was blocked 76.8 % by SB202190 (100 \u03bcM). In contrast, the ERK activation inhibitor U0126 (1, 10 and 100 \u03bcM) failed to inhibit GST-E7P-induced release of IL-1\u03b2 from monocytes but the release of IL-1\u03b2 with LPS (10 \u03bcg/ml), was blocked by 77.4% at 100 \u03bcM. After monocytes (4 X 10 6 /ml) were treated with HKa (600 nM) or LPS (10 ng/ml), total RNA was extracted and RT-PCR reactions for expression of IL-1\u03b2 and gC1qR mRNA using specific primers were carried out. PCR products was separated in 4% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels and photographed. No IL-1b mRNA was detected prior to exposure to HKa or LPS but both were detected at 1 hour. In contrast, gC1qR mRNA was present without stimulation by HKa. HKa domains 3 and 5 may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases by stimulating the synthesis and release of IL-1\u03b2 from human monocytes using intracellular signaling pathways initiated by uPAR, \u03b2 2 integrins and gC1qR receptors."
