    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3724 MCL is an aggressive and incurable subtype of B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Although patients often respond to first-line chemotherapy plus monoclonal antibodies, relapse and decrease response to further lines of treatment eventually occurs. Manipulation of the immune system to unleash its specificity and long-lasting protective effect might provide a unique opportunity to induce more durable responses or prevent relapse in MCL. Previous studies by our group have shown that HDAC6 is required for production of the immunosuppressive cytokine, IL-10 in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and that genetic or pharmacologic disruption of HDAC6 in these cells triggers potent antigen-specific T-cell responses. Given the role of IL-10 in suppressing the immunogenicity of B-cells, we asked therefore whether inhibition of HDAC6 with the isotype-selective inhibitor, Tubastatin-A (Tub-A) could reverse the tolerogenic properties of malignant B-cells in a murine model of MCL 1 . First, in vitro treatment of FC-muMCL1 cells with Tub-A resulted in increased acetylation of a-tubulin, a known HDAC6 target. Treated B-cells also displayed an enhanced expression of MHC class II and the co-stimulatory molecules B7.1, B7.2 and CD40 relative to untreated cells. Such changes resulted in more immunogenic MCL cells able to effectively activate nai\u0308ve antigen-specific CD4 + T-cells and more importantly, capable of restoring the responsiveness of anergic T-cells from lymphoma-bearing mice. Second, in vivo treatment of FC-muMCL1-bearing C57BL/6 mice with Tub-A resulted in lymphoma rejection. This antitumor effect was not observed in immunodeficient (SCID) C57BL/6 mice treated with Tub-A, pointing to the immunological effects triggered by HDAC6 inhibition in B-cells as playing a dominant role in Tub-A induced anti-MCL activity. Third, mechanistically we have found that HDAC6 physically interacts with STAT3 and it is required for STAT3 phosphorylation and recruitment to the IL-10 gene promoter. Furthermore, Tub-A treated MCL cells displayed a diminished STAT3 phosphorylation and abrogation of IL-10 gene transcriptional activity. Taken together, a concerted regulatory mechanism involving HDAC6 and STAT3 influence the immunogenicity of MCL cells. Targeting HDAC6 with specific inhibitors to disrupt the tolerogenic STAT3/IL-10 axis represents a novel strategy to trigger effective anti-MCL immunity.
