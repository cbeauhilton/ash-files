    "abstract_text": "The branched chain amino acid (BCAA) pathway and high levels of BCAA transaminase 1 (BCAT1) have recently been associated with aggressiveness in several cancer entities. However, the mechanistic role of BCAT1 in this process remains largely uncertain. By performing high-resolution proteomic analysis of human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) stem cell (LSC) and non-LSC populations, we found the BCAA pathway enriched and BCAT1 protein and transcripts overexpressed in LSCs. We show that BCAT1, which transfers \u03b1-amino groups from BCAAs to \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG), is a critical regulator of intracellular \u03b1KG homeostasis. Next to its role in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, \u03b1KG is an essential co-factor for \u03b1KG-dependent dioxygenases such as EGLN1 and the TET family of DNA demethylases. Knockdown of BCAT1 in leukaemia cells caused accumulation of \u03b1KG leading to EGLN1-mediated HIF1\u03b1 protein degradation. This resulted in a growth and survival defect and abrogated leukaemia-initiating potential. In contrast, overexpression (OE) of BCAT1 in leukaemia cells decreased intracellular \u03b1KG levels and caused DNA hypermethylation via altered TET activity. BCAT1 high AMLs displayed a DNA hypermethylation phenotype similar to cases carrying mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH mut ), in which TET2 is inhibited by the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate. High levels of BCAT1 strongly correlate with shorter overall survival in IDH wt TET2 wt , but not IDH mut or TET2 mut AMLs. Gene sets characteristic for IDH mut AMLs were enriched in IDH wt TET wt BCAT1 high patient samples. BCAT1 high AMLs showed robust enrichment for LSC signatures, and paired sample analysis revealed a significant increase in BCAT1 levels upon disease relapse. In summary, by limiting intracellular \u03b1KG, BCAT1 links BCAA catabolism to HIF1\u03b1 stability and regulation of the epigenomic landscape mimicking the effects of IDH mutations. In essence, our data strongly suggest that suppression of \u03b1KG-dependent dioxygenases constitutes a common feature of AML and, next to mutations in IDH and TET2, we identify the BCAA-BCAT1-\u03b1KG axis as alternative, non-genetic mechanism in LSCs to control the activity of these enzymes. Strategies to increase \u03b1KG levels, i.e. by inhibition of BCAT1 in order to compromise cancer stem cell function may lead to improved clinical outcomes of patients suffering from AML or other tumour entities expressing high levels of BCAT1 in the absence of IDH or TET mutations.
