    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4284 Background: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with distinctive biologic and clinical features that is now highly curable. However, there are complicated issues in treatment strategies for induction, consolidation and maintenance that remain to be studied. The optimal regimen and the duration of consolidation is one of the above controversies. Patients and methods: Six patients (4 males, 2 females) were enrolled in this observation with a median age of 28 years (18\u201336). All were diagnosed de novo APL with demonstration of the abnormal increased promyelocytes of 53\u201390% accompanied with detection of t(15;17) or PML/RAR\u03b1 rearrangements. At diagnosis, WBC counts were 0.9\u20134.6\u00d710 9 /L and platelet counts were 13\u201384\u00d710 9 /L. Induction therapy was composed of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) with or without anthracycline or homoharritonine. After achieving complete remission (CR) following the above regimens, consolidation therapy was given monthly consisting single anthracycline agent of idarubincin (8\u201310 mg/m 2 /d, day 1\u20133) or aclarubicin (8\u201312 mg/m 2 /d, day 1\u20137) and alternative ATRA (25 mg/m 2 /d, day 1\u201315). After 12\u201318 months of consolidation, patients received maintenance therapy including methotrexate (12 mg/m 2 /d, per week) plus 6 mercaptopurine (30 mg/m 2 /d, qod \u00d712 days) and alternative ATRA (25 mg/m 2 /d, day 1\u201315) for one year. Results and conclusions: At present, all of the six patients are in continuous CR status, four of whom ceased treatment and are undergoing regular monitoring. Preliminary results from our experience demonstrates that single anthracycline and alternative ATRA can act as a valid option with limited toxicity for APL and might be used as a consolidation strategy, particularly for low and intermediate-risk patients. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
