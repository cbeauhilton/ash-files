    "abstract_text": "B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is a heterogeneous disease; some patients have a rapidly progressing disease and others exhibit an indolent course and survive for many years without treatment. Mutation status of IgVH genes utilized by CLL cells represents a very reliable predictor of clinical outcome in B-CLL, but its analysis is expensive and beyond the capacities of most diagnostic laboratories. To identify surrogate markers we performed a gene expression profiling analysis of CD19+ purified cells from 80 B-CLL untreated patients in Binet stage A, by means of Affymetrix GeneChip\u00ae HGU133A arrays. The comparison of 46 IgVH-unmutated versus 34 mutated samples using the Prediction Analysis of Microarrays software identified 78 differentially expressed probes, specific for 59 well-characterized genes. Specifically, 43 genes had a higher and 16 genes a lower average expression in the IgVH unmutated group. These genes are involved in cellular functions, including cell cycle regulation ( SEPT7 , SEPT10 , CDK2AP1 ), cell proliferation ( SLAMF1 , LDOC1 ), apoptosis ( CD63 , IFT57 , P2RX1 , RNF130 , TNFRSF1B ), cell adhesion ( CNTNAP2 , C1orf38 , PCDH9 ), immune response ( ZAP70 , IFI44 ), signal transduction ( AKAP13 , RASGRP1 , USP6NL , TGFBR3 , AKAP12 ), lipid metabolism and fatty-acid degradation ( FADS3 , LPL , LASS6 ), cell-cell signalling ( FCRL2 ), phospholipid biosynthetic process ( AYTL2 ), regulation of circadian rhythm ( EGR3 , CRY1 , OPN3 ), DNA-dependent regulation of transcription ( MYBL1 , NR4A2 , NRIP1 , ZBTB20 ), muscle development ( VAMP5 , SRI , DMD ). The expression signature identified in the proprietary database was then validated by means of a meta-analysis of a publicly available gene expression dataset of 100 B-CLL (Haslinger et al., 2005), showing classification accuracy measures leading to a global classification rate of 82.93% of the test set and thus suggesting the strength of the identified expression signature. The expression levels of 11 genes ( LPL , ZBTB20 , ZAP70 , CRY1 , COBLL1 , SEPT10 , LDOC1 , TNFRSF1B , DMD , SRI , NRIP1 ) were confirmed by means of quantitative real-time PCR (Q-RT-PCR) in a subset of 40 CLL patients. The prognostic impact for Time To Treatment (TTT) of the 59 candidate genes of our classifier model was investigated in 77 patients. Forty-nine (36.4%) of these received treatment after a median follow up of 4 years. As expected, patients with unmutated IgVH genes had a risk of therapy requirement that was about 3 times higher (HR: 3.1,95% C.I. 1.6\u20135.8, p<0.0001) than those with mutated IgVH. Based on microarray expression levels, 43/59 genes significantly predicted TTT with a HR ranging from 1.5 (LPL gene) to 4.2 (SRI gene) (value for ZAP-70 = HR: 1.9, 95% C.I. 1.0\u20133.4, p=0.039). The same analysis performed in the panel of the 11 genes validated by Q-RT-PCR revealed 4 candidate genes which significantly predicted TTT. Specifically, Cox univariate analysis confirmed ZAP-70 as a predictor of disease outcome and underscored the prognostic role of the LPL , TNFRSF1B and CRY1 genes. The predictive power of the novel putative surrogate markers for the IgVH mutation status is now being further validated at protein expression level."
