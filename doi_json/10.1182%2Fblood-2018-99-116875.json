    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of terminally differentiated, antibody secreting B cells known as plasma cells. Normal B cell differentiation and cell fate are coupled to epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming, including a proliferation-dependent global loss of DNA methylation (Barwick et al., 2016, 2018). However, relatively little is known about the epigenetic changes that underlie myelomagenesis and how these may contribute to pathogenesis. To this end, we are analyzing the DNA methylome of myeloma specimens from the MMRF CoMMpass trial (NCT01454297), which has already characterized the mutational, structural, and transcriptional landscape of nearly 1,000 myelomas from newly diagnosed patients. CoMMpass specimens were obtained from a centralized biobank with approval from the CoMMpass Tissue Use Committee and Emory IRB. DNA isolated from CD138+ myeloma specimens was subjected to reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) or whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). In total, DNA methylation was derived for over 24 million CpGs with an average of 18x coverage. WGBS data from normal B cells and plasma cells was obtained with permission from the BluePrint project (Agirre et al., 2015) via the European Genome Archive. DNA methylation levels were associated with PFS and OS using a cox proportional regression. We have determined the DNA methylome for 36 primary myeloma specimens and an additional 84 specimens are currently being sequenced. Relative to normal B cells that had an average DNA methylation level of 89.1%, plasma cells and myelomas exhibited a progressive demethylation with mean levels of 71.3% and 43.7%, respectively. While this is consistent with previous observations (Agirre et al., 2015; Salhia et al., 2010), WGBS revealed that myeloma in particular was characterized by large hypomethylated domains. These large hypomethylated domains encompassed genes that were devoid of gene expression whereas DNA methylation remained unchanged in the bodies of genes that were highly expressed. Although the majority of these hypomethylated domains were common across myelomas, there existed many regions where methylation levels varied between myelomas and these differences commonly corresponded with local gene expression differences. To understand if these specific patterns of DNA methylation were indicative of disease pathogenesis, DNA methylation levels were compared to PFS and OS. This identified 2,594 regions where the level of DNA methylation was prognostic of outcome (P\u22640.001). Reduced DNA methylation corresponded with poor outcome at 88.5% (N=2,298) of these regions, which included loci proximal to cell cycle genes such as MYC , E2F3 , CCND1 , and CCNE1 . Only 11.5% (N=296) of regions associated with outcome had higher levels of DNA methylation associated with poor prognosis. These regions tended to be proximal to genes involved in B cell receptor signaling, such as PLCG2 and VAV2 . Although the expression of several of these genes was also prognostic of survival, the majority were not, indicating that the epigenetic state contains a unique prognostic value. These data indicate that myeloma undergoes profound epigenetic remodeling that is co-ordinate with changes in gene expression. Perhaps the most striking feature were megabase domains of hypomethylation. That DNA methylation was preferentially retained in the bodies of expressed genes suggests that a molecular mechanism and/or cellular selection occurs to maintain methylation at genes whose expression is required for myeloma cell survival. Despite the small number (N=36) of myeloma specimens analyzed thus far, the large number of regions associated with survival indicates the potential prognostic value of DNA methylation in myeloma. Furthermore, DNA methylation indicative of outcome only partially overlapped with the prognostic value of gene expression, indicating DNA methylation has independent value as a biomarker of outcome in myeloma. This may be due, in part, to the fact that DNA methylation is a very stable modification that not only reflects the current gene expression program, but is also indicative of the cell history and potential. Integrative genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional analysis from WGBS of 120 CoMMpass myeloma specimens will be presented, including matched baseline and relapsed specimens from 25 patients.
