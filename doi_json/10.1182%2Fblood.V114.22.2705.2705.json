    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2705 Poster Board II-681 Conventional radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with directly radiolabeled anti-B cell antibodies (Ab) induces remissions in 50 to 80% of patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Although administering RIT as consolidation after chemotherapy improves response rates and produces long-term durable remissions in treatment-nai\u0308ve patients, the \u03b2-emitting radionuclides used in current RIT schemes may not be ideal for irradiating the microscopic tumors and the isolated tumor cells present in the setting of minimal residual disease (MRD). RIT with \u03b1-emitting radionuclides may be advantageous in the treatment of MRD because the short path length and high energies of \u03b1-particles produce optimal cytotoxicity at small target sites while minimizing damage to the surrounding normal tissues. Our group has successfully demonstrated that pretargeted RIT (PRIT) using streptavidin (SA)-Ab and radiolabeled biotin allows rapid specific localization of radioactivity at tumor sites. PRIT using \u03b1-emitting radionuclides may be particularly attractive since the most promising \u03b1-emitting radionuclides in clinical settings, such as 213 Bi (t\u00bd = 46 min), have short half-lives and pretargeting allows the delivery of radioactivity to tumor sites before the activity decays. We therefore performed in vivo studies to evaluate the biodistribution of 213 Bi with PRIT. Athymic mice with B-cell NHL (Ramos) xenografts received a tetravalent anti-CD20 (1F5) single-chain (scFv) 4 SA fusion protein (FP) or a CC49 (scFv) 4 SA FP (non-binding negative control) followed by an N-acetyl galactosamine clearing agent (CA) and subsequent 213 Bi-DOTA-biotin infusion. Tumors, blood, and major organs were collected to determine the percent injected dose per gram (%ID/g) at various time points within \u223c3 half-lives of 213 Bi. Maximal tumor uptake for 1F5 (scFv) 4 SA FP was 16.5 \u00b1 7.0 %ID/g at 90 minutes vs. 2.3 \u00b1 0.9 %ID/g for the control FP (p = 0.0001). Biodistributions of 213 Bi using a conventional RIT scheme with directly labeled Ab were also evaluated. Athymic mice with Ramos xenografts received 213 Bi labeled 1F5 Ab or 213 Bi labeled HB8181 Ab (a murine isotype matched nonbinding control). Maximum tumor uptake for 1F5 Ab was 3.0 \u00b1 0.9 %ID/g at 180 minutes vs. 2.3 \u00b1 0.7 %ID/g for the control Ab (p = 0.171). There were no significant differences in tumor uptake and normal organ distribution between the two Ab within 180 minutes of radiolabeled Ab injection presumably due to the protracted circulating half-life of radiolabeled Abs. These results were concordant with our previous experiments using other radionuclides, showing that maximal targeting of radiolabeled Ab occurs between 20 to 24 hours; well beyond the effective half-life of 213 Bi. When the results of PRIT and RIT studies were directly compared, tumor-to-blood ratios were 58 to 426-fold higher with PRIT than with conventional RIT. Tumor-to-normal organ ratios of nearly 100:1 were observed with PRIT compared to 3:1 or less with conventional RIT. Using the most favorable PRIT schemes defined in the biodistribution experiments, the therapeutic efficacy of 213 Bi was evaluated. Mice treated with PRIT using 1F5 (scFv) 4 SA FP followed by a CA and 600 \u03bcCi 213 Bi-DOTA-biotin experienced significant delays in tumor growth. The 1F5 (scFv) 4 SA FP treated animals had a mean tumor volume of 0.01 \u00b1 0.02 vs. 203.38 \u00b1 83.03 mm 3 for the CC49 control group at 19 days (p = 0.0006). The median survival for 1F5 group was not reached after 90 days; whereas, the median survival was 23 days for the CC49 group (p = 0.0019) and 16 days for untreated mice (p = 0.0023). The treatment was well tolerated, with no treatment-related mortalities in any group. These data demonstrate that PRIT using 213 Bi has a favorable biodistribution profile and excellent therapeutic efficacy. This model may be particularly effective in MRD settings and further studies are ongoing.
