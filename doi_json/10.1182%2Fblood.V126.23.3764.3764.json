    "abstract_text": "Refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains an unsolved therapeutic challenge. Various T-cell immunotherapies are promising options in relapsed/refractory B-ALL, like the CD19/CD3-bispecific T-cell engaging antibody Blinatumomab. Until now it has not been possible to determine critical factors for T-cell attack against leukemia that decide on in vivo response or non-response to treatment. Immune-checkpoint molecules regulate immune escape of malignant cells and antibody blockade of these inhibitory pathways enhances antitumor immune responses. Therefore, we investigated the role of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules for effector-target cell interactions and influence on T-cell attack against leukemia. CD19 + lymphoblast lines, primary pediatric B-ALL bone marrow blasts (n=10) and physiologic CD19 + CD10 + pre-B bone marrow precursors from healthy bone marrow were screened for surface expression of 20 different co-signaling molecules. Surface expression of PD-L1, PD-1, LAG3, CD40, CD86, CD27, CD70 and HVEM revealed differences in stimulatory and inhibitory profiles of pediatric ALL blasts as compared to physiologic cells. Pediatric ALL patients refractory to Blinatumomab-treatment (n=4) as well as patients with relapsed leukemia (n=7) showed increased expression of PD-L1 on blasts. Expression of exhaustion markers PD-1 and TIM-3 was significantly higher on patients' T cells as compared to healthy donors and is induced by T-cell attack against blasts. Blinatumomab-mediated T-cell function was examined in healthy donors as compared to pediatric patients with ALL through analysis of proliferation and effector function. Significant differences in Blinatumomab-induced T-cell function were found to be target-cell dependent and correlated to expression of co-signaling molecules on target cells. Blockade of inhibitory PD-1-PD-L and CTLA-4-CD80/CD86 interactions could further enhance effector T-cell function of healthy donors and patients whereas blockade of co-stimulatory CD28-CD80/86 interactions resulted in reduced T-cell effector and proliferation potential. Combined treatment with Blinatumomab and PD-1 blocking antibody Pembrolizumab was feasible and induced an anti-leukemic immune response in a 12 year old patient with refractory ALL. In conclusion, we show that regulation of T-cell activation and inhibition by co-signaling molecules guides the efficacy of T-cell attack against ALL. Inhibitory interactions between leukemia-induced checkpoint molecules on T cells and their counterparts on ALL regulate in vivo resistance to T-cell immunotherapy and will guide future therapeutic interventions.
