    "abstract_text": "B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an incurable disease and represents a significant health problem in the western world. We and others have reported that primary CLL B-cells spontaneously produce increased levels of proangiogenic basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in vitro and that most CLL plasma contains elevated levels of bFGF. However, the precise role of bFGF in CLL pathobiology is not clearly understood. In this study we investigated the functional implication of the FGF/FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling axis in CLL B-cell biology. We have detected expression of FGFR1 and FGFR3 with comparatively higher levels of the latter receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), but no or notably low levels of FGFR2/FGFR4, by flow cytometry and Western blot analyses in primary CLL B-cells. This observation was further supported by detection of FGFR1/FGFR3 transcripts in CLL B-cells by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Although both FGFR1 and FGFR3 in CLL B-cells remain as constitutively phosphorylated, we found significantly higher levels of phosphorylation on FGFR3 and thus this latter receptor is likely the predominant RTK of the FGFR family in these leukemic B-cells. Of note, in vitro stimulation of FGFRs with recombinant bFGF was unable to increase total phosphorylation on FGFRs from their constitutive basal levels in CLL B-cells. Further analysis using a bFGF neutralizing antibody suggested that FGFR phosphorylation in CLL B-cells is likely independent of bFGF ligation. We then interrogated the mechanism of how FGFRs were being phosphorylated and/or maintained at the observed constitutive levels of phosphorylation in CLL B-cells. Our previous studies established that Axl is a critical RTK in CLL B-cells since it acts as a docking site for multiple cellular kinases/lipase, an observation supported by earlier literatures in human malignancies. Given this, Axl is likely capable of cross talk with other RTKs including FGFRs to regulate FGFR-signaling in CLL B-cells. Therefore, in an effort to determine whether Axl is functionally associated with FGFR, we examined if these two RTKs exist in the same molecular complex in CLL B-cells. Indeed, immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that Axl formed a complex with FGFR3 in CLL B-cells, suggesting that Axl is likely functionally linked to the FGFR signaling. In this regard we found that Axl inhibition, using a high-affinity Axl inhibitor (TP-0903; Tolero Pharmaceuticals), resulted in significant reduction of total FGFR phosphorylation in CLL B-cells. Additionally, siRNA-mediated partial depletion of Axl in CLL B-cells reduced total FGFR phosphorylation. In contrast, inhibition of FGFR phosphorylation using a high-affinity FGFR inhibitor could not alter phosphorylation levels on Axl RTK in CLL B-cells. Together, these findings suggest that Axl has a dominant role in the regulation of FGFR signaling in CLL B-cells. To find out if inhibition of FGFR can induce apoptosis in CLL B-cells we used a specific inhibitor for FGFR (TKI-258; Novartis) to treat CLL B-cells. Here we found a substantial level of apoptosis induction in the leukemic B-cells with a mean LD 50 dose of ~2.5 \u03bcM. Interestingly, Axl inhibition by TP-0903 induced a robust level of apoptosis in CLL B-cells in the nanomolar dose range with a mean LD 50 dose of 0.14 mM. Thus Axl inhibition exerts a very robust cytotoxic effect on CLL B-cell survival likely targeting both Axl and FGFR signaling pathways via Axl inhibition. In conclusion, we have detected expression of constitutively active FGFR1 and 3 in primary CLL B-cells and that inhibition of FGFR signaling induces considerable levels of CLL B-cell apoptosis albeit lower than that observed on Axl RTK inhibition. Interestingly, our findings here suggest that Axl forms an active RTK complex with FGFR and that Axl inhibition modifies FGFR phosphorylation levels. Thus it is likely that Axl RTK can regulate FGFR signaling in the CLL B-cells. In total these observations suggest that the finding of robust induction of apoptosis in CLL B-cells is as a result of targeting two signaling pathways with Axl inhibition: Axl and FGFR. These studies further support investigation of Axl inhibition as a way to develop a more effective and efficient therapeutic intervention for CLL patients.
