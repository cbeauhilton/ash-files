    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4044 Background: Conventionally, multiple myeloma is believed to coexist in approximately 10% of AL amyloidosis patients. However, it is unclear whether this figure is too low based on current World Health Organization criteria. These criteria, mainly created to differentiate myeloma from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, include the presence of \u2265 10% plasma cells on a bone marrow biopsy or aspirate as being diagnostic of myeloma. Aims: To define the frequency and relevance of a concomitant diagnosis of myeloma in patients with AL amyloidosis. Methods: Records from consecutive patients with biopsy-proven AL amyloidosis treated at the Stanford University Amyloid Center were reviewed. Plasma cell percentages were determined by manual counts from bone marrow aspirate smears and by CD138 immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed on bone marrow core biopsies. Results: A total of 41 patients (median age 61 years, 32% female) were evaluated. The median number of organs involved with amyloidosis was 2 (range 1\u20134), with 28 patients (68%) having cardiac involvement, 22 patients (54%) having renal involvement, 15 patients (37%) having gastrointestinal involvement, 12 patients (29%) having soft tissue involvement, and 10 patients (24%) having nervous system involvement. All patients had bone marrow biopsies and aspirates performed at the time of amyloid diagnosis, with most undergoing both manual counts of plasma cells from aspirates and IHC from core biopsies. Based on conventional criteria, manual aspirate counts defined 15/28 (54%) patients as having myeloma, and IHC defined 26/31 (84%) patients as having myeloma (p=0.01). Only nine patients had a detectable serum paraprotein on immunofixation (median 1.1 g/dl, range 0.4\u20132.6). 81% of patients had an elevated serum free light chain (85% lambda), with a median level of 37.3 mg/dl (range 8.6\u2013256 mg/dl). Compared to the frequency of elevated plasma cells, the prevalence of anemia (29%), hypercalcemia (14%), impaired kidney function (21%), and lytic lesions (7%) was low. After a median follow-up of 13 months (range 1\u2013127 months), the one-year overall survival (74% vs. 58%) and three-year overall survival (50% vs. 50%) was not significantly different between patients with \u226510% plasma cells and patients with <10% plasma cells (p=NS). Discussion: As defined by bone marrow plasma cell involvement, a strikingly high percentage (84%) of AL amyloidosis patients would be considered to have concurrent myeloma. This figure is much higher than has been traditionally quoted in the literature, likely due to the utilization of newer methods of counting plasma cells. There was a low prevalence of myeloma-associated end-organ effects (hypercalcemia, anemia, renal insufficiency, lytic bone lesions), and a myeloma diagnosis had no impact on survival. Conclusion: In this cohort of AL amyloid patients, concomitant myeloma was present in the vast majority of patients using modern diagnostic techniques. The significance of this diagnosis appears to be minimal \u2013 calling into question whether the diagnostic criteria for myeloma should be redefined in this population.
