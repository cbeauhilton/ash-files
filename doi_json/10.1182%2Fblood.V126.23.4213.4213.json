    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a plasma-cell malignancy characterized by dismal prognosis and a high level of relapse, thus novel therapeutic approaches are needed. PRIMA-1 Met is a novel small molecule showing anti-tumour activity and currently in clinical phase I-II trials. We recently demonstrated that PRIMA-1 Met has potent anti-MM activity in vitro and in vivo. Bortezomib (BTZ) is a proteasome inhibitor that has been successfully used for treating some cases of relapsed MM. The aim of the current study is to determine whether PRIMA-1 Met could be used in combination with BTZ to enhance the cytotoxic effects in myeloma cells. METHODS Using three different MM cell lines (LP1, U266 and 8226), we established dose response curves for both PRIMA-1 Met and BTZ, and tested drug cytotoxicity using MTT assays. We then tested drug cytotoxicity of a range of concentrations of the drugs in combination. The Chou Talay method was used to determine whether or not the drug combinations were synergistic. A gene expression array was used to investigate the mechanism of the drug combination's effects. Total RNA was isolated from MM cell pellets, then synthesized cDNAs were applied to real time RT-PCR gene expression arrays containing 84 genes of interest. The genes selected were involved in apoptotic as well as cell growth and proliferation pathways. After normalization to 4 different housekeeping genes, fold changes in gene expression were analyzed in both drug treated and control samples using the 2 -\u0394\u0394Ct algorithm. Western blot analysis was used to further investigate proteins of interest. RESULTS Cell viability of 8226, LP1 and U266 cells treated with individual concentrations of PRIMA-1 Met (10uM) and BTZ (10nM) was on average 65%, 45% and 72.5%, respectively. However, combination of above doses reduced viability to 20% in 8226 and LP1, and to 40% in U266. The Chou Talay method identified this drug combination as synergistic in 2 out of the three tested cell lines, with Combination Index (CI) values of 0.72 in 8226 and 0.582 in U266. The gene expression analysis in real time RT-PCR indicated that the drug combination resulted in downregulation of genes involved in cell cycle and proliferation (CCND1, CDK4, CDK6, CDK2, IGFIR), genes from the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulation (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1), as well as MDM2 from the p53 signalling pathway, and MYC, which is involved in both apoptosis and cell cycle progression. Western blot analysis revealed up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3 and -9, implying involvement of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in the drug combination's activity. CONCLUSION Our results reveal that PRIMA-1 Met synergistically enhances the anti-MM effect of BTZ, leading to a significantly higher level of MM cell death. Real time RT-PCR gene array analysis offers some insight into the mechanism of this combination's effect, implicating apoptotic, cell cycle and growth regulating genes. Our study provides framework for further evaluation of this drug combination as a novel therapeutic strategy in MM. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
