    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a hematologic malignancy characterized by clonal expansion of abnormal myeloid progenitors, is a complex disease exhibiting a dynamic mutational landscape over time. Somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH ) 1 and 2 genes occur in ~20% of patients with AML, resulting in production of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Ivosidenib (IVO), a mutant IDH1 (mIDH1) inhibitor, is approved in the US for m IDH1 relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML and newly diagnosed m IDH1 AML in patients \u226575 years old or with comorbidities precluding intensive induction chemotherapy. Durable remissions in m IDH1 R/R AML were achieved with IVO in a phase 1 study (NCT02074839), with a complete remission (CR) plus complete remission with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) rate of >30%, and a median duration of CR+CRh response of >8 months. In these patients, bulk next-generation sequencing (NGS) identified the most frequent baseline co-mutations as DNMT3A (34%), NPM1 (23%), and SRSF2 (20%), with m IDH2 detected in 2 of 101 (~2%) patients (DiNardo et al. N Engl J Med 2018). Though a recent case study (Harding et al. Cancer Discov 2018) described the appearance of m IDH2 in patients who relapsed to IVO (isoform switching), the frequency of this phenomenon is unknown. In addition, it is unclear whether m IDH2 and other co-occurring mutations exist within the same clone as m IDH1 at baseline and relapse, as dynamic clonal architecture cannot be precisely imputed by bulk NGS. Aim: To define clonal architecture heterogeneity and pattern of mechanism of relapse at single-cell resolution in a subset of patients with m IDH2 detectable by bulk NGS following IVO treatment. Methods: Single-cell targeted DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) was performed on matched patient peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples at baseline and relapse, using a microfluidic platform (Tapestri \u00ae ) with a 19-gene AML panel (Pellegrino et al. Genome Res 2018) capable of detecting rare subclones to a level of 0.1%. Data were processed and analyzed using Tapestri \u00ae Insights software and the timescape R package. Results: Of 129 patients with available longitudinal genomic profiling data, 15 (12%) patients had detectable m IDH2 on treatment. Here we report findings from 9 of 15 patients with available scDNA-seq data. Seven of 9 patients had no detectable m IDH2 at baseline. Six of these 7 acquired m IDH2 at relapse within the same clone as the original m IDH1 , whereas m IDH2 was identified in a separate clone to m IDH1 in 1 patient. In the 2 of 9 cases in which m IDH2 was detected at baseline, m IDH2 was present in a separate clone to m IDH1 . AML-related gene mutations (e.g. PTPN11 , NRAS, ASXL1 ) were also identified upon relapse following IVO treatment. Figure 1 demonstrates the emergence of m IDH2 in the same cell as m IDH1 , concurrent with the expansion of a separate m IDH1 clone harboring a PTPN11 mutation at relapse. Figure 2 demonstrates two distinct m IDH1 clones at baseline, one harboring NPM1/NRAS co-mutations and the other harboring NPM1/FLT3- TKD co-mutations. Following IVO treatment, the IDH1/NPM1/NRAS clone was no longer detected. Reduction in the IDH1/NPM1/ FLT3- TKD clone was observed at Cycle 2 Day 1, but it ultimately expanded at relapse with the acquisition of m IDH2 . In both cases, plasma 2-HG was first inhibited by >95% but increased at relapse. Furthermore, phylogenetic tree reconstruction from clonotypes indicated patterns of both branching and linear clonal evolution. Conclusions: In a subset of patients with m IDH2 detectable at relapse, m IDH2 was mostly not detectable at baseline but emerged within the same clone as m IDH1 , highlighting 2-HG restoration as an important mechanism of resistance to IVO. Moreover, these data provide unique insights into the clonal dynamics in patients with m IDH1 R/R AML harboring mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway, notably that the presence of RTK mutations at baseline does not universally preclude a clinical response. scDNA-seq proved to be a powerful tool in delineating molecular outcomes for patients with m IDH1 R/R AML. These findings, a part of emerging data highlighting the interplay between baseline mutation profiles and response and clonal evolution on treatment, support combinations or sequential treatment modifications at early relapse before overt clinical progression.
