    "abstract_text": "Deletion of a variable region on chromosome 11q containing FLI1 causes a platelet-related bleeding disorder in Paris-Trousseau thrombocytopenia and Jacobsen syndrome. We report a kindred with the autosomal recessive inheritance of an ETS domain mutation of FLI1 , c.970C>T, that causes macrothrombocytopenia with large alpha granule fusion similar to that observed in Paris-Trousseau thrombocytopenia but with no other syndromal features of Paris-Trousseau or Jacobsen syndromes. Affected individuals are moderately thrombocytopenic (mean = 71 x10 9 /L), have absent collagen-induced platelet aggregation and a lifelong mucosal bleeding history. Platelet MYH10 levels were increased in affected members of the kindred consistent with previous reports of elevated MYH10 in Paris-Trousseau thrombocytopenia. Luciferase reporter assays in HEK293 cells demonstrate that the mutant FLI1 transcript is associated with decreased transcription at the FLI target genes GP6 , GP9 and ITGA2B compared to the wild-type transcript (23 vs 31, n=9, P<0.01; 3.8 vs 6.5, P<0.01, n=12; 11 vs 14, n=9, P=0.01, respectively). This transcriptional change was consistent with reduced expression of GPVI (P<0.01), GPIbIX (P<0.01) and GPIIbIIIa (P=0.04) observed on western blotting of platelet lysates from affected family members. This mutation replaces the conserved Arg324 with a tryptophan in the DNA-binding loop between the alpha-2 and alpha-3 helices of the FLI1 ETS domain. Protein modelling suggests that Arg324 does not directly bind DNA but may instead make direct contact with an N-terminal autoinhibitory domain of FLI1 that is considered to regulate DNA-binding affinity through a transition between a folded and unfolded state. This mutation may disrupt this important conformational change. These data suggest abnormalities of FLI1 function may be responsible for the complex platelet defect observed in Paris-Trousseau thrombocytopenia and Jacobsen Syndrome and confirm the role of FLI1 as an important transcriptional regulator of normal platelet development.
