    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1082 Background: The prognosis of patients with APL has improved with all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3 ) therapy. An increasing frequency of isolated CNS relapse is reported in APL survivors and intrathecal prophylaxis has been proposed. We have used oral As 2 O 3 as prolonged maintenance therapy for APL patients in first remission (CR1) and beyond. During oral As 2 O 3 therapy, elemental arsenic penetrates the CNS at meaningful levels. The risk factors for CNS APL in this setting are unknown. Material and methods: From 2001 to 2009, consecutive APL patients in ATRA +/\u2212 chemotherapy-induced CR1, or As 2 O 3 +/\u2212 chemotherapy-induced CR2 and beyond, were given As 2 O 3 maintenance therapy, comprising oral As 2 O 3 therapy (10mg daily) and ATRA (30mg twice daily), given two weeks every two months for two years. CNS leukemia was diagnosed by the presence of typical APL cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Patients with CNS leukemia were treated with intrathecal methotrexate (12 mg twice weekly until clearing of CSF) and oral-As 2 O 3 , ATRA and ascorbic acid. Results: A total of 102 APL patients (46 men, 56 women) at a median age of 43 (13\u201343) years received oral As 2 O 3 maintenance during CR1 (n=63) and CR2 or beyond (n=39). The median follow-up period was 55 (8\u2013143) months. At initial presentation, the hematological parameters were hemoglobin: 8.5 (3\u201314.6) g/dL, white cell count: 10.1 (0.3\u2013121) \u00d7 10 9 /L (with 21 cases >10 \u00d7 10 9 /L) and platelet count: 35 (3\u2013162) \u00d7 10 9 /L (with 67 cases <40 \u00d7 10 9 /L). A total of 25 patients had a history of steroid treatment for APL differentiation syndrome. Leucocytosis (> 15 \u00d7 10 9 /L) developing either during ATRA or As 2 O 3 treatment occurred in 62 patients. For the whole cohort, the median peak leucocyte count at any time point in the clinical course was 29.3 (0.8\u2013243) \u00d7 10 9 /L. Eight patients (7 men, 1 woman, median age 49 years) developed CNS leukemia, at a median of 42 (1\u201356) months from commencement of As 2 O 3 maintenance. All had a history of elevated peak WCC, at a median of 69.5 (26\u2013123) \u00d7 10 9 /L. Symptoms included headache (n=3), dizziness (n=2), confusion, blurred vision and leg weakness. The median CSF cell count was 35 (7\u20132500) \u00d7 10 6 /L. Concurrent marrow morphologic relapse was found in 4 cases (first relapse, R1, n=1; R2, n=3). Four patients had normal blood counts and marrow morphology (still in CR1, n=1; CR2, n=3), although their peripheral blood cells were positive for PML-RARA by polymerase chain reaction. All patients responded completely to treatment initially, but recurrent CNS leukemia still occurred in 4 cases after 12\u201316 months. Additional treatment including cranial radiotherapy (n=6), systemic high dose cytarabine (n=2) and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (n=1). Three patients ultimately died of refractory APL at a median of 13 months after CNS relapse. On univariate analysis, risk factors for CNS relapse were male gender (RR 6.8, p=0.001), and leucocytosis at any time point (for WCC > 15\u00d710 9 /L, RR 8.4, p=0.004; for WCC > 20\u00d710 9 /L, RR 12.1, p<0.001). There was no significant relation to age, ATRA syndrome, hematologic parameters on presentation and disease status at commencement of oral As 2 O 3 maintenance. Conclusions: With prolonged survival of APL patients, CNS leukemia is emerging as an important problem that curtails survival. Based on the use of oral As 2 O 3 maintenance, patients who at any time point in the clinical course developing a leucocytosis of > 15\u201320 \u00d7 10 9 /L are at high risk of CNS relapse and should be considered suitable candidates for CNS prophylaxis.
