    "abstract_text": "Abstract 151 The platelet integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 mediates platelet aggregation by binding the adhesive plasma proteins fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor. We previously reported that co-crystallizing the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 headpiece with either of the two ligand mimetic drugs eptifibatide or tirofiban, or with a fibrinogen \u03b3-chain peptide, results in the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 headpiece adopting an open conformation characterized by a swing-out motion of the \u03b23 hybrid domain. In addition, all of the compounds bound both to the \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 subunits, with the \u03b23 contact mediated in part by coordinating the MIDAS metal ion. We recently reported on RUC-1, a novel \u03b1IIb\u03b23-specific small molecular antagonist that we predicted from molecular docking and biochemical data bound exclusively to \u03b1IIb. We have now determined the crystal structure of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 headpiece in the absence of ligand and after soaking in RUC-1, and correlated the findings with advanced molecular dynamics simulations and functional studies of mutant receptors to define the mechanism of RUC-1 binding. The crystal structure shows that the \u03b1aIIb\u03b23 headpiece in the absence of RUC-1 or other ligand adopts a closed conformation with minimal \u03b23 swing-out, similar to what we found in the full-length ectodomain of the bent receptor in the absence of ligand. Strikingly, RUC-1 only binds to the pocket formed by the \u03b1IIb \u03b2-propeller domain and has no contact with MIDAS metal ion or other sites in the \u03b23 I domain. Standard molecular dynamics studies revealed a very similar binding pocket for RUC-1, which reflects the lowest energy binding state as assessed by metadynamics simulations. Both the crystal structure and the metadynamics studies identified \u03b1IIb Y190 and \u03b1IIb D232 as important for RUC-1 binding. RUC-1 is a much less potent inhibitor of mouse and rat \u03b1IIb\u03b23 than human \u03b1IIb\u03b2; both mouse and rat have \u03b1IIb Y190F substitutions, and in addition, rat \u03b1IIb has a D232H substitution. A recombinant cell line expressing Y190F \u03b1IIb\u03b23 demonstrated an \u223c80% reduction in RUC-1 affinity as judged by a 6-fold increase in IC 50 for inhibiting fibrinogen binding and one expressing D232H \u03b1IIb \u03b23 had more than a 95% decrease in affinity for RUC-1. To test whether RUC-1's exclusive binding to the \u03b1IIb subunit was associated with a reduced ability to induce a conformational change in \u03b1IIb\u03b23, we performed gel filtration and dynamic light scattering studies. In sharp contrast to the effects of eptifibatide and tirofiban, RUC-1 did not induce \u03b1IIb\u03b23 to adopt a less compact conformation in either system. These data suggest that ligand engagement of the \u03b23 I domain, in particular coordinating the MIDAS metal ion and stabilizing the \u03b21-\u03b11 loop movement toward the MIDAS, is a likely trigger for \u03b23 undergoing its swing-out motion. These data have potential therapeutic implications because they raise the possibility of inhibiting \u03b1IIb\u03b23 with an \u03b1IIb-specific antagonist that does not initiate the conformational changes in \u03b23 that have been hypothesized to underlie the development of two major toxicities of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 antagonists, thrombocytopenia and paradoxical activation of the receptor.
