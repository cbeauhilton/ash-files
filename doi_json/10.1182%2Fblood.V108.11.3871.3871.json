    "abstract_text": "Background: The prevalence of clinically significant gastro esophageal reflux (GERD) in the general population varies between 3\u20136%. We have observed GERD to be one of the major complaints of our patient population with monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS). There is no literature available on the incidence of GERD in MGUS. However, there have been conflicting reports on the prevalence of helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and MGUS. Objective: To study the incidence and relationship of GERD, H. pylori and MGUS. Methods: We identified all patients diagnosed with MGUS at the Kansas City VA Medical Center over the last 20 years. Out of the 417 patients identified with MGUS, 394 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All patients with GERD were evaluated by gastroenterologists at our institution who determined their diagnostic and therapeutic management. Charts on these patients were then reviewed for endoscopic findings, pathological biopsies, H. pylori staining on histology, serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation (SPEP/IFE), immunoglobulin levels, and bone marrow biopsies. Results: In this study, 41% patients with MGUS were noted to have moderate to severe symptoms of GERD (162/394). The median age of patients with and without GERD was similar (72 versus 71 years). Endoscopies were performed on 60% of the patients with GERD (97 of 162). Histology was positively stained for H. pylori in 27.8% patients (27/97). We did not find any correlation between H. pylori positivity and the type or level of monoclonal protein. In addition, we observed no change in immunoglobulin levels following treatment and eradication of H. pylori. Conclusion: The incidence of GERD is significantly higher in patients with MGUS than in the general population. In our study, no correlation was seen between H. pylori infection and MGUS."
