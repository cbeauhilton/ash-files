    "abstract_text": "Integrin \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 (CD11d/CD18), the most recently discovered member of the \u03b2 2 sub-family of adhesion receptors, is strongly upregulated on macrophage foam cells which underscores its potential role in atherosclerosis. However, the contribution of \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 to monocyte/macrophage adhesive reactions and the significance of its overexpression on these cells remain unknown. Recently we characterized \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 as a multiligand receptor capable of binding many extracellular matrix proteins with the recognition specificity overlapping that of the major myeloid-specific integrin \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 (Mac-1). We hypothesized that the \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 ability to bind numerous ligands in the extracellular matrix and its capacity to be upregulated to high density on the surface of macrophages may modulate cell adhesiveness and, thus, affect migration. To evaluate the role of \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 in migration, we generated model and natural cells expressing different densities of \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 and tested their migration to different extracellular matrix proteins. In vitro studies demonstrated that \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 expressed at low densities, either on the surface of HEK293 cells or the mouse macrophage cell line IC-21, supported migration which was partially inhibited by anti-\u03b1 D function-blocking antibodies. Furthermore, \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 3 integrins expressed on HEK293 cells and IC-21 macrophages, respectively, contributed to migration because anti-\u03b2 1 and anti-\u03b2 3 antibodies inhibited migration. Increased expression of \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 on the surface of HEK293 cells and its upregulation by PMA on IC-21 macrophages resulted in the inhibition of cell migration. Ligation of \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 with anti-\u03b1 D antibodies restored \u03b2 1 - and \u03b2 3 -driven cell migration by means of removing restraints imposed by the excess of the \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 -ligand adhesive bonds. To test the possibility that progressive upregulation of \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 can block macrophage migration in vivo , we assessed the effect of anti-\u03b1 D function blocking antibodies using the thioglycollate-induced peritonitis model. More than 4-fold upregulation of \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 was detected on macrophages in 72 h after thioglycollate stimulation and, similar to in vitro studies, the numbers of migration macrophages increased in the presence of anti-\u03b1 D antibodies. These results demonstrate that the density of \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 can modulate cell migration and suggest that low levels of \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 can contribute to monocyte migration while \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 upregulation on differentiated macrophages might facilitate their retention at the site of inflammation."
