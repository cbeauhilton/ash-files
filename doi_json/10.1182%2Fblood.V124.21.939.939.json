    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Methotrexate (MTX) is an important and effective chemotherapeutic drug in the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However MTX can induce toxicity, which can lead to amendments of treatment and subsequent impaired survival. The aim of this study was to identify metabolic and genetic determinants of MTX toxicity. Patients and Methods: In this prospective study, 134 Dutch pediatric ALL patients were treated with four high dosages MTX (HD-MTX: 5 g/m 2 ) every other week according to the DCOG-ALL10 protocol. Toxicity was prospectively scored and a National Cancer Institute (NCI) grade \u22653 was considered clinically relevant toxicity. Plasma MTX levels were measured at 24 and 48 hours after each HD-MTX infusion. Erythrocyte folate, plasma folate and plasma homocysteine levels were determined at the start of protocol M. Seventeen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 7 candidate genes in the MTX pathway were analyzed. Results: Grade \u22653 mucositis occurred in 20% of the patients, skin toxicity in 7%, diarrhea in 3%, and neurotoxicity in 3%. Mucositis occurred especially after the first course compared to the other courses (p=0.006). Mucositis was not associated with plasma MTX, plasma folate or plasma homocysteine levels. Patients with mucositis had higher baseline levels of erythrocyte folate (median 1.2 \u03bcmol/L vs. 1.4 \u03bcmol/L, p<0.008). Wildtype rs7317112 in the ABCC4 gene was the only SNP associated with a higher frequency of mucositis (AA (39%) vs. AG/GG (15%), p=0.016). Conclusion: Mucositis is the most frequent occurring toxicity during the HD-MTX phase in pediatric ALL treatment, and occurs especially after the first MTX course. Only a higher baseline erythrocyte folate, which reflects the accumulation of MTX polyglutamates in mucosal cells, and the wild-type variant of rs7317112 SNP in ABCC4 were determinants of mucositis in pediatric ALL during MTX-HD treatment.
