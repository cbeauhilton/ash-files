Objective: To define the prognostic impact of transfusion-dependency and serum ferritin levels. Results: From April 2008 until December 2010, 1000 patients have been registered in fourteen European countries. The median age is 74 years (range 18\u201395), 60% are male. The WHO subgroups are RCMD (35.8%), RARS (18.2%), RA (17.6%), RAEB-1 (11.6%), del5q (6.2%), MDS-U (3.1%) and RAEB-2 (0.4%). IPSS score (n=935) is 0 in 48.8%, 0.5 in 31.2% and 1 in 13.5%. At time of registration 19% of the patients had started MDS specific treatment, increasing to 46% at 18 months of follow-up, usually consisting of erythroid-stimulating agents (ESA). At registration 29% of the patients were transfusion-dependent, which remained stable during follow-up. The number of transfusion-dependent patients with ESA treatment decreased from 58% to 27% at 18 months of follow-up. Overall survival at 18 months of follow-up was 89%. The mortality rate in transfusion-independent and transfusion-dependent patients at 18 months of follow-up was 5% and 21%, respectively (P300 <1000 \u03bcg/L and group 3. \u22651000 \u03bcg/L. The mortality rate according to serum ferritin at registration in these groups was 6%, 14% and 23%, respectively, with HRs 1.80 (95%CI 1.06\u20133.03) and 3.21 (95% CI 1.66\u20136.20), including adjustment for transfusion status and number of transfusions. To define the relationship between serum ferritin and transfusion-dependency, the serum ferritin levels in the three groups were compared in transfusion-independent and transfusion-dependent patients. The mortality rate according to serum ferritin at registration in transfusion-independent patients was 3%, 6% and 3%, respectively (HR 2.17 and 0.95 respectively). The mortality rate according to serum ferritin at registration in transfusion-dependent patients was 14%, 21% and 35%, respectively (HR 1.69 and 3.93 respectively) ( Table 1 ; Graph 1 ). To define the prognostic value of transfusion burden, patients were divided in groups based on transfusion status: 1. No transfusions, 2. Transfusions 20 units. The mortality rate in these groups was 5%, 18% and 30%, respectively. The adjusted HRs were 3.67 (95% CI; 2.28\u20135.91) and 5.50 (95% CI; 3.18\u20139.52), respectively ( Table 1 ).

However, transfusion burden is the most important prognostic factor for survival in patients with more than 20 units transfused compared to non-transfused patients. An increased risk was also apparent for moderately transfused patients (<20 units) so direct toxicity of transfusions (toxic iron radicals?), even at a relatively low iron load, might have an important adverse impact on survival.
