    "abstract_text": "Several conflicting options regarding management of adult ALL are currently discussed. One major issue is the indication for SCT depending on risk factors and age, and the other is the recommendation to use unmodified pediatric protocols for \u201cyoung\u201d adults. Decision making on SCT is generally based on conventional risk factors \u2013 mainly disease characteristics \u2013 available at diagnosis, and decision making for \u201cpediatric\u201d chemotherapy on age. It is essential to develop more sophisticated criteria \u2013 also to reduce the risk of selection in clinical trials. In order to enhance prognostic models and to better address individual patient characteristics and the course of disease we reanalysed conventional prognostic factors together with new patient specific factors in a large cohort of adult ALL patients. A total of 1657 well characterised pts (15\u201355 yrs) included in the risk stratified protocols of the German Multicenter Study Group (GMALL) 06/99 and 07/03 was analysed. Treatment and risk stratification have been described ( Bru\u0308ggemann, Blood  2006 : 107 ; 1116 ). Age remained a highly significant factor for CR, survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS). OS ranged from 58% for 15\u201325 yrs, 52% for 26\u201335 yrs, 43% for 36\u201345 yrs to 32% for 45\u201355 yrs (p=.0001). Poorer outcome with increasing age was mainly due to early death (ED) and death in CR. CR, OS (45% c/pre-B, 45% pro-B, 38% early T, 47% mature T and 64% thymic T;p30) was associated with higher ED (p=.04). BMI (low vs normal vs high) had a significant impact on OS (43% vs 48% vs 39%;p=.003). Additional prognostic factors were identified during therapy. OS was sign.inferior for pts with infections in induction phase II compared to others (39% vs 52%;p 30.000/\u03bcl, late CR, Ph/BCR-ABL, proB in B-precursor and early or mature T-ALL in T-lineage ALL are poor prognostic factors. These factors identify pts for SCT. Age has a high prognostic relevance and is not used for this purpose but for selection of age adapted treatment approaches. For the first time other new prognostic factors were described. Poor general condition identifies pts who need specific attention e.g. stabilisation before treatment start. Furthermore complications during induction \u2013 particularly infections and liver toxicity \u2013 as well as treatment delays in general affect outcome adversely. These findings support the hypothesis that a) results in adult ALL can be improved by better supportive care, protocol compliance and subgroup adjusted treatment and b) these and additional individual factors e.g. comorbidity should be utilised to refine prognostic models and decision making on intensive chemotherapy and/or SCT including dose-reduced SCT.",
