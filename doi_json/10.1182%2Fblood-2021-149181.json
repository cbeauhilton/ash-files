    "abstract_text": "Background: Autologous CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) products are approved as standard treatment options for patients (pts) with relapsed diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and follicular lymphoma (FL). Their long-term efficacy for DLBCL is ~40% and is unknown for other histologies. Additionally, associated toxicities including cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) remain a challenge. CD20 is a proven target for treatment of B-NHLs/CLL with demonstrated high clinical efficacy of unmodified, radiolabeled, and bispecific antibodies. Therefore, CD20-targeted CAR-T represents a promising adoptive immunotherapy option that could be utilized to treat relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-NHLs and CLL. MB-106 is a fully human 3rd-generation CD20-targeted CAR-T product with both 4-1BB and CD28 costimulatory domains. We present results of our ongoing phase I/II clinical trial investigating safety and efficacy of CD20 CAR-T for high-risk B-NHLs and CLL (NCT03277729). Methods: Pts with R/R CD20+ B-cell malignancies are eligible, including but not limited to DLBCL, FL, MCL, and CLL. Prior treatment with CD19 CAR-T is permitted. Lymphodepletion (LD) consists of cyclophosphamide (Cy) \u00b1 fludarabine (Flu). CAR-T cells are administered at one of 4 dose levels (DL): DL1: 3.3x10 5 , DL2: 1x10 6 , DL3: 3.3x10 6 , DL4: 1x10 7 CAR T cells/kg. A continual reassessment method dose escalation design was used to find the maximally tolerated dose. CAR-T is infused in the outpatient setting except for the first pt of each dose cohort (overnight observation). Treatment response is assessed on day 28. CRS and ICANS are graded per ASTCT consensus grading. The study underwent a major cell manufacturing modification after treating 7 pts with no objective responses as previously reported (Shadman, ASH 2020, #1443). This abstract includes pts who were treated under the modified process. Results: Between Dec 2019 and July 2021, 16 pts (12 FL, 2 MCL, 1 CLL, 1 DLBCL) were treated after LD with Cy-Flu and had day 28 assessment. All DLs were reached (see table), with no dose-limiting toxicities to date. CRS occurred in 7 pts (44%): 4 pts with grade (Gr) 1 and 3 with Gr 2. ICANS was observed in 1 pt (6.2%) at Gr 2. There were no Gr 3 or Gr 4 CRS or ICANS. Median time to CRS was 6.5 days (range, 0-12); the 1 ICANS event occurred on day 12. One pt (CLL) developed Gr 3 temporary neuropathic pain which, in the absence of other explanation, was attributed to the CAR-T. No pts had tumor lysis syndrome or Gr 3-4 infections. Thrombocytopenia (Gr 3-4: 19%) and neutropenia (Gr 3-4: 94%) were common but there were no bleeding complications, and the rate of febrile neutropenia was 19%. Overall response (ORR) was 94% (15/16) with complete response (CR) rate of 62% (10/16). In FL pts (n =12), ORR was 92% (11/12) and CR rate was 75% (9/12). Among FL pts who received DL 3 or 4, the CR rate was 86%. The CLL pt had a PET-negative CR and undetectable measurable residual disease in peripheral blood and bone marrow by flow cytometry (10 -4 ) (uMRD4) on day 28. The pt with DLBCL achieved a partial response (PR) on day 28 and a repeat PET on day ~ 90 showed continued improvement but still indicating a PR. Among pts who achieved a CR, only one pt (FL) relapsed after 9 months. All other CRs are ongoing (range: 3-18 months). CAR-T persistence was lost at day 95 in 1 pt who had progression and proceeded to other anti-lymphoma treatment; 2 other patients lost CAR-T engraftment by day 181 and 201 with B cell recovery. All other patients continue to have detectable CAR-T cells as of last follow-up (max 13 months post-infusion). Conclusion: Treatment with MB-106 shows a favorable safety profile with no Gr 3 or Gr 4 CRS or ICANS. In addition, we observed a high rate of ORR and CR with ongoing CRs and high rate of CAR-T persistence. Enrollment is currently ongoing; data will be updated at the time of presentation.
