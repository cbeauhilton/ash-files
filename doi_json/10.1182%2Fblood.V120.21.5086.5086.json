    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5086 Purpose of the study: We observed an increased frequency of hematologic malignancy (HM) in patients and family members of patients with renal cell cancer (RCC) and sought to characterize the association further in terms of frequency and characteristics of HM, and the importance of such an association. Methods: We performed a chart review of our data base of approximately 700 RCC patients seen by us from 2004 to the present in an effort to determine the frequency of HM in patients and in the families of patients diagnosed with RCC. Results: Of the 700 charts reviewed, both HM and RCC occurred in 19 individuals. [11 males and 8 females]. HM diagnosis included acute myeloid leukemia in 1 patient, Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) in 4 pts, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in 7 pts, (3 small cell and 4 large B-cell lymphoma), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in 2 pts and hairy cell leukemia (HCL), monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) myelodysplasia (MDS) in one patient each. A family history of HM was found in 71 relatives involving 56 families of patients with RCC. Of these, 48/71 cases of HM were in first degree relatives and 18/71 were in second degree relatives. The most common HMs were lymphoma and leukemia: 24 NHL, 9 HL, 6 lymphoma not further specified (NOS), 11 CLL, 1 acute myeloid leukemia, 5 acute leukemia NOS and 6 leukemia NOS. Other HM observed once were multiple myeloma, Waldenstro\u0308m's macroglobulinemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. In addition, 2 family members had blood cancers that were NOS. Thus, of 77 patients/family members with known HM diagnosis 94% were B-cell malignancies. Clear cell histology was the most common subtype of RCC, and all subtypes of RCC occurred in the study population with expected frequency. RCC and HM occurred in the same patient in this study more frequently at 2. 7% than would be expected from a SEER database. In that database the observed to expected (O/E) ratio of NHL and RCC was 1. 86 to 2. 07% [Kunthur et al. Am J Hematol 2006; 81:271\u201380]. Conclusions: Increased incidence of B-cell malignancy has been reported in individuals with RCC [Dutcher et al. Proc Am Fed Clin Res, Eastern Division, April 2011]. Wiernik et al. [Cancer J 2000] reported a similar increase was noted between adenocarcinoma of the breast and B cell malignancies in same individual and mouse mammary tumor virus was proposed a potential causative agent. There is a preponderance of B-cell malignancy in both the individuals and in the families of the patients with RCC noted in this study. The etiology of this association between RCC and HM is unclear and suggests a common etiopathogenesis for RCC and B-cell tumors, or a familial immunologic defect that facilitates both malignancies. We plan to further explore the relationship of HM to RCC. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
