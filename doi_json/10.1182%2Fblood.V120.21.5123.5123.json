Since BPDCN can evolve into acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMML) with other cases associated with monocytosis, a close relationship of BPDCN to the myelomonocytic lineage is suspected. Here we investigate the frequency of myeloid-associated DNA mutations in BPDCN using a targeted exon sequencing panel. Methods: Nine cases of BPDCN (5 skin, 1 lymph node, 3 bone marrow clot sections) were studied. All showed blastic cytomorphology; characteristic expression of CD56 and CD123; CD4 and/or TCL1 expression; and absence of definitive lymphoid, myeloid, and monocytic marker expression. AMML recurrence at 18 months, seen in 1 patient, was also assessed. Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections and subjected to a 161-amplicon PCR-based DNA sequencing assay that includes the commonly mutated areas of KRAS , NRAS , IDH1 , IDH2 , TET2 , EZH2 , JAK2 , and ASXL1 . Limited multiplex PCR and product harvesting was performed on an Access Array chip (Fluidigm). Ion adaptors were added and DNA sequencing was performed on a PGM sequencer using the 316 chip with 200 base-pair sequencing chemistry (Life Technologies). Sensitivity of mutation detection varied between 5\u201310%. Sequencing data were analyzed by SeqNext software (JSI MedSystems). Detected mutations were confirmed using conventional Sanger sequencing, with an approximate sensitivity of 15%, or pyrosequencing (5%). Results: Mutations in one or more of the tested genes were found in 6 of 9 patients, with unconfirmed mutations in 2 additional cases due to low-level mutations in samples with poor quality DNA. One patient with a typical BPDCN showed an IDH2 mutation (R140Q) with recurrence as AMML showing this mutation as well as a double mutation in KRAS (G12R, Q61R). Other mutations identified included 3 in ASXL1 including W608C, NRAS G12D, EZH2 C-terminal truncation, and 2 TET2 indels. Conclusions: The presence of myeloid-associated mutations particularly in IDH2 , TET2 and ASXL1 in cases of BPDCN is support for a relationship to the myelomonocytic lineage. The presence of shared and new mutations in the AMML recurrence in 1 patient with BPDCN further indicates a pathogenetic relationship between the two entities.
