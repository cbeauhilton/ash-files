    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4002 The lack of specific molecules to define malignant B progenitor cells in multiple myeloma (MM) has hampered the evaluation of minimal residual disease (MRD). We have identified a bone marrow (BM) CD138- subset that co-express CD19+ with identical \u03ba or \u03bb light chain (LC) restriction as the abnormal plasma cell (PC), as previously shown by others. The majority of LC restricted (LCR) B progenitors are CD19+/CD34- and  4 or <0.5) may not apply in B progenitors. LCR B progenitors (CD19+/34+ or CD19+/34-) are CD117+, Notch+ and Survivin+ as MM patient's hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). ALDH enzymatic activity is 3.1% (0.1-\u20137.26%) in LCR B cells. Flow sorted CD138+ did not grow in a colony formation assay (methylcellulose with PHA-LCM), whereas CD19+/CD34- or CD19+/CD34+ grew colonies with efficiency of 1:25,000 or 1:10000 respectively. Cells harvested from colonies have a lympho-plasmacytoid appearance and LCR B progenitors differentiated into CD138+ PC (80\u00b15%) compared to HSC (10\u00b15%). Colony efficiency was optimized (3 fold) using conditioned medium (CM) from HS5-stroma. Isolated CD138-/CD19+ cells were relatively bortezomib and melphalan resistant compared to CD138+ PC. We hypothesize that CD138-/CD19+/CD34+ cells contains earlier progenitor B cells that differentiate into the malignant PC. Surrogate assays for stem cell activity and xenotransplant models should determine cancer stem cell activity of immature B cell precursors. Research studies of MM putative progenitor cells will allow developing novel treatments to eradicate potential MM MRD reservoir.
