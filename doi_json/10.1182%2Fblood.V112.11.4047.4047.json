    "abstract_text": "Background: Primarily eliminated by the kidneys, low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) need to be monitored carefully when used in patients with severe renal insufficiency, because of the concern about bioaccumulation, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Individual LMWHs have not been compared with each other in large clinical trials, and currently there is no standard of practice for the use of LMWH in this patient population. Methods: Computerized queries of PubMed, MEDLINE, and the American Society of Hematology abstract database were performed to identify clinical trials assessing the safety of LMWHs in patients with severe renal failure (creatinine clearance [CrCl] <30 mL/min). Results: A meta-analysis of 15 studies of enoxaparin and 2 studies of tinzaparin (N = 5201) showed that when compared with patients with a CrCl >30 mL/min, those with a CrCl \u226430 mL/min had more than double the risk of major bleeding and higher peak anti-Xa levels ( Lim et al, 2006 ). Much of this effect was confined to patients who received standard therapeutic doses of enoxaparin ( Mahe et al, 2007 ). A study of medical patients with a reduced CrCl treated with tinzaparin or enoxaparin showed significantly increased mean anti-Xa activity in the enoxaparin group but not in the tinzaparin group, indicating a significant accumulation of enoxaparin but not of tinzaparin ( Mahe et al, 2007 ). Recent data suggest that dalteparin, when used at prophylactic doses, does not bioaccumulate and can be used safely in patients with severe renal impairment ( Tincani et al, 2006 ; Douketis et al, 2007 ). Conclusions: Whereas studies suggest that enoxaparin bioaccumulates in patients with severe renal insufficiency ( Mahe et al, 2007 ), dalteparin and tinzaparin do not appear to bioaccumulate to the same degree ( Tincani et al, 2006 ; Mahe et al, 2007 ; Douketis et al, 2007 ). These differences may be explained by the fact that smaller LMWH chains (enoxaparin) are cleared primarily by the kidneys, whereas larger chains (dalteparin, tinzaparin) have greater clearance by nonrenal mechanisms. Thus, dalteparin and tinzaparin may be preferred in patients with renal impairment. Table. Summary of recent trials evaluating dalteparin and tinzaparin in patients with renal impairment  Trial .
