    "abstract_text": "Background: In children busulfan (Bu) is often included in conditioning regimens prior to allogeneic (allo-) haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The IV Bu formulation represents a substantial improvement over the oral Bu form for the control of Bu-systemic drug exposure (AUCs) and for successful targeting, but the age-based dosing (3\u20134 years cut-off) is not likely to be the optimal strategy (L Nguyen et BMT 2004). We tested IVBu fixed dose body-weight (BW) based calculation combined with cyclophosphamide (Cy) as conditioning regimen prior to allo-HSCT. Aims: To validate and confirm the PK relevance of this new dosing strategy which allows to target AUC (900\u20131500 \u03bcM.min) in children, To investigate the safety especially the early non-relapse mortality (NRM), to evaluate the consequences of such IVBu administration modalities upon children clinical outcomes. Methods: Thirty-six children (21 male/15 female) with a median age and weight of 7.5 y (range 0.3 to 17.2 y) and 27 kg (range 5.0 to 62.0) were enrolled. Indications for HSCT were: AML (n = 17: 14 CR1, 2 CR2, 1 PR), CML (n = 3), ALL (n = 1), MDS (n = 1), SAA (n = 1); hemoglobinopathy (n = 8), and immunodeficiency (n = 5). IVBu (Busilvex\u00ae) was given over 2 h q6h \u00d7 16 doses at: 1.0 mg/kg, 1.2 mg/kg, 1.1 mg/kg, 0.95 mg/kg, and 0.8 mg/kg for pts with 23\u201334 kg, and >34 kg BW, respectively. Cy was given at 50 mg/kg qd\u00d74. Donors were HLA-matched related (28/36) or unrelated (5/36). Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Bu at dose 1, 9, and 13, and regimen-related toxicity (RRT) were determined. Cumulative incidence (Ci) of relapse / NRM, and Kaplan-Meier EFS/OS were estimated. Results: PK results are available in 28/36 pts. Although Bu clearance was highly variable (CV= 45%), the average AUCs after 1 st and subsequent doses were similar whatever age and BW. In 75 % of pts AUC was within the target AUC. Mean AUC at dose 1 was 1205 \u00b1 187 \u03bcM.min (range 963\u20131619 \u03bcM.min). All pts engrafted at 19 days (range 9\u201347) for neutrophils \u2265 0.5 \u00d710 9 /L, and 30 days (range 16\u2013111) for platelets \u2265 50 \u00d710 9 /L. Donor cells (DC) were documented in all recipients: 31/36 achieved complete chimerism (> 99% DC), and 5/36 were mixed chimeras (> 85% DC). IVBu was well tolerated: one grade (G) IV toxicity (pulmonary), G III (mainly stomatitis) occurred in 14 pts. VOD occurred in 8% (95% CI: 1.8\u201322.5%) but none was severe. Grades II\u2013IV a-GVHD rate was 42%. There was one death (3%) at day+100, and Ci of NRM was 6% \u00b18% (hemorrhage =1, c-GVHD =1). After a median follow-up of 36.7 months (range 3.9\u201349.1) the Ci of relapse, EFS and OS rates were: 12% \u00b111%, 82% \u00b113%, and 85% \u00b112%, respectively. For pts with malignancies (mainly AML) the results are excellent: neither VOD nor NRM, and EFS and OS rates were 82% \u00b116%, and 86% \u00b114%, respectively. Conclusions: The new IVBu dosing optimises Bu treatment, confirming that IVBuCy is an efficacious, reduced-toxicity, myeloablative conditioning regimen for children undergoing standard HSCT.",
