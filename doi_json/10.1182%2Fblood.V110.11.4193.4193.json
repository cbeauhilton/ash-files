    "abstract_text": "To investigate the effect of bortezomib alone or combined with harringtonine (HT) or arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3 ) on the proliferation activity and apoptosis of HL60/ADM cell line and refractory/relapse acute leukemia primary cell. HL60/ADM cells or refractory/relapse acute leukemia primary cells were incubated with bortezomib at different doses alone and in combination with HT or As 2 O 3 . The proliferation activity was abserved by MTT assay, cell apoptosis was studied by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Intracellular concentration of daunorubicin (DNR) was determined by flow cytometry. In bortezomib-treated tumor cells, inhibition rate enhanced and apoptotic cells increased in mumber time- and dose-dependently. 40nM Bortezomib can best inhibit the proliferation activity of HL60/ADM cells when incubated for 48 hours. 15uM As 2 O 3 or 752nM HT combined with different doses of bortezomib can inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of HL60/ADM cells, The dual inhibition of As 2 O 3 plus bortezomib or HT plus bortezomib may present a superior anticancer efficancy to either inhibition of the drugs above alone (P<0.05;<0.01). Bortezomib (10nM) can markedly enhance the intraceflular accumulation of DNR in HL60/ADM cells(P=0.000). Bortezomib can inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of HL60/ADM cells and refactory/ relapse acute leukemic primary cells. When combined with HT or As 2 O 3 appear to have synergistic effects, and the mechanisms might be associated with the ability of reversing multidrug resisitant of Bortezomib.",
