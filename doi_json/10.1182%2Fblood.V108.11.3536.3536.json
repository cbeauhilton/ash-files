    "abstract_text": "Bortezomib (btz) has established efficacy in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) patients (pts). Combinations of btz and other agents can produce even higher response rates. We have reported that oral cyclophosphamide (CY) + prednisone (P) produced partial remissions (PR) in 41% and a median progression free survival (PFS) of 18.6 mos in MM pts who had progressed after ASCT. We now report a phase I trial adding btz to CY + P in 27 patients with relapsed/refractory MM. CY was given p.o. once weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28 day cycle while P 100 mg was given every other morning. CY was given before btz on appropriate days. A total of 8 cycles was planned. The median age was 59 yrs (48\u201374); 16 were male. Ig subtypes were: IgG (19 pts), IgA (4 pts), kappa light chain (4 pts). The median number of prior regimens was 2 (1\u20136); all had undergone prior ASCT and 59% had received thalidomide and/or lenalidomide. The median pretreatment \u03b22-microglobulin was 228 nm/L (114\u2013875), albumin 38 g/L (30\u201346) and creatinine 86 nmol/L (58\u2013153). The dose escalation scheme and toxicity with cycle 1 is shown below: Table 1. Dose levels and toxicity  Dose Level . N . CY dose (mg/m 2 ) . Btz dose (mg/m 2 ) .

Dose limiting toxicity was not seen. The median number of protocol cycles given per pt was 7 (1\u20138); 1 pt chose to continue therapy and has received 15 cycles. Toxicities in cycles 2\u20138 were generally mild. Episodes of infection included shingles (5), gr 3 respiratory infection (6) and febrile neutropenia (2). A total of 168 cycles have been administered; the dose of CY was reduced in 5 cycles due to neutropenia (\u2193ANC) (3), thrombocytopenia (1) or increased AST/ALT (1), while the btz dose was decreased in 4 cycles due to gr 2 peripheral neuropathy (PN) (1) or \u2193ANC (3). 12 pts have completed all 8 cycles, 5 are on therapy and 7 have progressed after a median of cycles 3 (1\u20137). 3 stopped protocol therapy (physician choice in 1 pt with minimal response, gr 2 PN in 2 pts (after 7 cycles at dose levels 2 and 5) including the pt with prior btz dose reduction. 14/15 pts treated at dose levels 4\u20136 (effective btz doses) were evaluable for response after receiving at least 2 cycles. Best response was CR/nearCR in 6 (43%) and PR in 7 (50%) for an overall response rate of 93%. The median follow-up is 12 mos (1\u201320). 6 pts have progressed after stopping therapy. The median PFS is 11 mos, while the median overall survival (OS) has not been reached. The actuarial 1 year OS and PFS are 83% (95% CI 61\u201393%) and 47% (95% CI 24\u201368%), respectively. 7 of 10 planned additional pts have entered the phase II portion of the trial at dose level 6. 3 have completed at least 2 cycles; 2 are in CR/near CR while one is in PR. We conclude: Btz 1.5 mg/m 2 can be given safely on a convenient weekly schedule days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle in combination with full dose oral CY + P in relapsed/refractory MM pts; preliminary response rates at this dose level include 4/6 (67%) CR/near CRs and 1/6 (17%) PR."
