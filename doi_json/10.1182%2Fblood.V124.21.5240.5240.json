    "abstract_text": "Objective: In this study, we investigated the influence of adriamycin and wogonin to the expression of miR-155 in Burrkit lymphoma in vitro. We focused on exploring the efficiency and pathway of wogonin to induce the apoptosis of lymphoma cells through the transcription and translation level of miR-155 compared with ADM and seeking for the evidence of the synergistic effect between wogonin and ADM. Methods: (1) Use drugs to interfere the growth of the Raji cells (Adriamycin (ADM, chemical name:doxorubicin), wogonin, ADM+wogonin), observe the cells through the microscope. (2) The apoptosis of Raji cells was tested by FCM. (3) The transcription of miRNA-155 of Raji cells was tested by real-time PCR. (4) The translation of miRNA-155 of Raji cells was tested by Western blot. Results: (5) After being disposed for 24 hours,the experimental groups developed to apoptosis.The statistic significance existed between groups of experiment and control and groups of each experiment.The effect of inducing apoptosis from strong to weak was group of ADM+wogonin,ADM and wogonin. (6) After being disposed for 24 hours,the transcription level of miRNA-155 of the experimental groups was lower than the control group.Compared with ADM,the transcription level of miRNA-155 of wogonin group seemed to be stronger,while the combination of the two drugs was the weakest. (7) After being disposed for 24 hours,the translation level of p85\u03b1 of the experimental groups was lower than the control group. Compared with ADM, the translation level of p85\u03b1 of wogonin seemed to be stronger, while the combination of the two drugs was the weakest. Conclusion: The Chinese materia medica preparation wogonin could induce the apoptosis of lymphoma cells and enhance the effect of ADM through PI3K/AKT pathway.
