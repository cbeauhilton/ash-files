    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Despite recent advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), curative outcomes remain elusive with standard therapies. MM is characterized by immune dysregulation and a loss of tumor-associated T cell surveillance contributing to disease evolution. Cancer vaccines have emerged as a promising immunotherapeutic strategy that seeks to reestablish anti-tumor immunity through the effective presentation of tumor associated antigens in the context of positive costimulation and activation signals. DCOne is a cell based tumor vaccine derived from an acute myelogenous leukemia cell line, differentiated toward a dendritic cell (DC) phenotype (DCPrime, Netherlands). DCOne strongly expresses WT-1, PRAME, RHAMM, survivin, and MUC-1. Since MM cells commonly express these tumor-associated antigens as well, we explored the efficacy of DCOne in inducing myeloma-specific immunity. Methods/Results: We first investigated the capacity of DCOne to polarize T cells toward an activated phenotype. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from MM patients were cultured in the presence or absence of DCOne and pulsed with whole cell DCOne lysate 24 hours prior to analysis. Intracellular levels of IFN-\u03b3 and perforin in CD8 + T cells and intracellular levels of IL-10 in CD4 + T cells were assessed via FACS analysis. Following 10 days of co-culture, we observed an increased percentage of CD8 + IFN-\u03b3 + T cells and an increased percentage of CD8 + perforin + T cells in PBMCs co-cultured with DCOne versus those not co-cultured with DCOne (10.8% versus 3.3%, p=0.02, n=11 and 6.6% versus 1.7%, p=0.045, n=10, respectively). In contrast, exposure of PBMCs to DCOne did not alter the percentage of CD4 + IL-10 + T cells (p=0.53, n=8). Given the observed increase in IFN-\u03b3- and perforin-positive CD8 + T cells after co-culture of MM PBMCs with DCOne, we investigated whether CD8 + T cells co-cultured with DCOne exhibited enhanced killing of autologous tumor cells in a standard cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) assay measuring Granzyme B activity by FACS analysis. DCOne potently induced CTL-mediated killing of autologous MM cells as determined by an increased percentage of CD8 + Granzyme B + cells in stimulated versus control cells (27.4% versus 12.5%, p=0.05, n=3). We next investigated the mechanism of action by which DCOne elicited a MM-specific response. We postulated that the allogeneic cell line would induce immune activation in part through the transfer of antigen to PBMC-derived antigen presenting cells; these antigen presenting cells would in turn be capable of eliciting response via MHC restricted presentation of antigen to autologous T cell populations. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrated that 32% of patient-derived PBMCs exhibited uptake of DCOne RNA following co-culture (n=3). Uptake of DCOne RNA by patient-derived PBMCs was completely abrogated with Transwell separation. Next, we examined how patient-derived PBMCs take up DCOne antigens. Using Western Blot analysis, we found that MUC-1 and survivin are expressed in extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from DCOne lysate. Thus, we conclude that DCOne antigens are trafficked via EVs secreted by the DCOne parent cell, whereupon they are taken up by MM patient-derived PBMCs. Conclusion: In conclusion, when cultured in vitro with MM patient-derived PBMCs, DCOne results in increased IFN-\u03b3- and perforin-positive CD8 + T cells, as well as induction of autologous tumor killing by these cells. DCOne RNA is taken up by MM patient-derived PBMCs and trafficked to the extracellular environment via EVs. DCOne demonstrates in vitro efficacy as an \"off-the-shelf\" strategy for stimulating MM-specific immunity. A clinical trial is being planned.
