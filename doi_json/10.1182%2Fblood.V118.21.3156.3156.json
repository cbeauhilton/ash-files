    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3156 Introduction Clinicians have different expectations and perceptions regarding the role of primary care providers (PCPs) and hematologist/ oncologists (Hem/Oncs) in the provision of follow-up and survivorship care for patients with hematologic malignancies, and for the cancer survivor in general [Cheung JCO 2009]. The continuing decline in the number of specialists will require PCP involvement in the care of the patients with hematologic malignancies in particular, as well as cancer survivors in general. An outcomes study investigated barriers to shared care/ co-management of patients with hematologic malignancies and current practices of PCPs and Hem/Oncs regarding communication, provider roles and responsibilities and resources needed to implement effective cancer survivorship care plans. Methods: Internet polling surveys within an educational activity developed by the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) and Medscape LLC with outcomes assessment by CE Outcomes, LLC. The activity learning objectives centered on roles and communication touch points for PCPs and Hem/Oncs, strategies and tools for optimal patient care, and recommendations for care of survivors with hematologic malignancies. Case-based education was delivered by an expert panel of hematologist/oncologist and primary-care physicians to illustrate critical communication points between Hem/Onc and PCP. The activity addressed regional variations in care, fragmentation of care, and helped define healthcare provider roles in the shared\u2013care model. Electronic health records (EHR) and a treatment summary form were discussed as methods for effectively communicating a survivorship care plan among healthcare providers. More than 4, 000 physicians participated in the activity; 170 specialists and 587 PCPs were respondents to the survey. Polling questions and outcomes survey addressed barriers and current practices in shared care of patients with hematologic malignancies. Responses of PCPs and Hem/Oncs were aggregated and compared to identify gaps in continuity of care between specialties. Results: A summary of interactivity responses of PCPs (N=587) and Hem/Oncs (N=170) shows the most significant barrier to co-management of patients with hematologic malignancies was \u201clack of defined roles and responsibilities for PCPs vs specialists\u201d (51.5% Hem/Onc vs 53.2% PCP). Confusion over roles is evident as 55.6% of Hem/Onc respondents expect the oncology specialist to follow the patient during the \u201cwatch and wait' period, while 45.8% of PCPs expect the PCP to follow the patient, and 35.4% expect the PCP and specialist to follow the patient together. More than half of PCPs and specialists report that they should co-manage follow up for cancer recurrence. The majority of PCPs and specialists report that standardized communication tools are from \u201cvery to extremely important\u201d yet only approximately one third of PCPs and specialists are currently using EHR resources, with a third in the process of implementing EHR in their practices. Conclusions: Barriers to the provision of shared care and co-management of the cancer survivor can be addressed by more clearly defining individual clinician roles and responsibilities. Bridging gaps in the survivorship care plan requires improved communication between Hem/Oncs and PCPs to coordinate \u201cwatch and wait\u201d care and follow-up screening, and effective methods to transfer patient records and history including Treatment Summary Forms and EHR.
