    "abstract_text": "Background: Ibrutinib (I) and venetoclax (V) have each demonstrated modest single-agent activity in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) ( Gopal A, JCO 2018; Davids M, JCO 2017 ). Preclinical data have shown synergy with these agents in B\u2010cell cell lines ( Kuo H, Mol Cancer Ther 2017 ). Based on these observations, we proposed the first trial to combine I and V in FL. Results from the phase Ib portion of this multi-institutional investigator-initiated trial are presented here (NCT02956382). Methods: This phase Ib/II trial is open at Georgetown/Lombardi CCC, Hackensack/John Theurer CC, and University of Washington/Fred Hutchinson/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Eligibility criteria include WHO grade 1\u20103a FL, >1 prior systemic therapy, measurable disease warranting therapy by standard criteria or physician discretion, ECOG performance status < 2, adequate marrow, hepatic, renal function. Patients (pts) were enrolled in a standard phase I 3+3 design at a starting dose level (DL) of I 420 mg daily, V 400 mg daily (DL0). The highest initially planned dose level was DL3: I 560 mg daily, V 800 mg daily. There was no dose ramp up of V based on monotherapy experience in FL. Pts at high risk for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), defined as node \u2265 8 cm and/or significant lymphocytosis, were hospitalized for initial dose. Pts received study drugs until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Response was assessed by PET-CT and bone marrow biopsy (if marrow involvement present at time of enrollment). Results: Sixteen pts were enrolled between November 2017 - May 2020. Median age was 66 years (range 50-87); 75% were male; 75% were Stage III/IV, 94% had WHO grade 1/2 FL (Table 1). FLIPI score at enrollment was 25% low risk, 44% intermediate risk, 31% high risk. Two pts were considered high risk for TLS. Pts received a median of 2 prior therapies (range 1-8); 19% were refractory to last line of therapy. Cohort enrollment was: DL0 (n=3), DL1 (n=6), DL2 (n=6), DL3 (n=1). The protocol was amended to close DL3 based on pharmacokinetic data from DL2 indicating a 1.8-fold higher mean steady-state ibrutinib plasma exposure compared to ibrutinib 560 mg monotherapy and concern for potential toxicity. Grade 3 adverse events (AE) included neutropenia (25%), thrombocytopenia (13%), lung infection (13%), upper respiratory infection (6%), neutropenic fever (6%), atrial fibrillation (6%), ALT/AST elevations (6%), mucositis (6%), failure to thrive in setting of progression (6%), abdominal pain (6%). There were no grade 4/5 AE. Grade 1/2 AE occurring in > 20% of pts included diarrhea (75%), nausea (63%), bruising (38%), rash (31%), headache (31%), constipation (25%), fatigue (25%). There was no evidence of clinical TLS; 19% had grade 1 hyperuricemia. The pt enrolled at DL3 had grade 1 diarrhea, grade 1 neutropenia. One dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred at DL1 (I 560 mg, V 400 mg): grade 3 neutropenia with fever and infection. There were no other DLTs. Therefore, DL2 (I 560 mg, V 600 mg) was determined to be the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The ORR was 69% (0.413, 0.890); CR 25% (0.073, 0.524). The ORR at the RP2D was 83% (CR 33%). Responses by dose level are listed in Table 2. The regimen demonstrated activity in the bone marrow; 2 pts had eradication of involvement and 1 had a decrease from 60% to 0.5% by flow cytometry. Response by lines of prior therapy: 1 (86%, 6/7), > 2 (56%, 5/9). Most pts (91%) had a response by time of first assessment (12 weeks). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.3 months (5.6 months, NA) (Figure 1). Of note, 2 responding pts chose to withdraw from study due to travel and were censored in the PFS analysis at time of discontinuation. One remained in a CR at least 9 months after study withdrawal as documented by PET-CT performed off protocol. No pts discontinued due to toxicity. Conclusion: In the first clinical trial to combine a BTK inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor in relapsed/refractory FL, we found the I-V doublet to demonstrate a toxicity profile similar to that seen in mantle cell lymphoma and CLL. While our sample size is small, there was no evidence of clinical TLS, despite omission of the V ramp up. Preliminary results of anti-tumor activity are encouraging and further evaluation at the RP2D (I 560 mg, V 600 mg) is ongoing in the phase II trial. The combination of ibrutinib and venetoclax may provide an effective option for FL, utilizing a targeted approach distinct from other novel agents currently approved for this malignancy.
