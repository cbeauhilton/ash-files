    "abstract_text": "Adoptive transfer of NK cells is a promising immunotherapeutic modality, however limited NK cell persistence and proliferation in vivo have historically been barriers to clinical success. Nicotinamide (NAM), an allosteric inhibitor of NAD-dependent enzymes, has been shown to preserve cell function and prevent differentiation in ex vivo culture of NK (NAM-NK) and other cells. Clinical responses were observed in a Phase 1 trial of NAM-NK (GDA-201) in patients with refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Bachanova, et. al., Blood 134:777, 2019). We now use transcriptional and metabolic profiling to characterize the mechanisms underlying the activity of NAM-NK. CD3 negative lymphocytes obtained from healthy donors were cultured for 14 days with IL-15 in the presence or absence of NAM (7 mM). Next generation sequencing (NGS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolite quantification, and glycolytic/mitochondrial respiration measurements were performed. Transcriptome and pathway enrichment analyses were performed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Extracted cellular and medium metabolites were analyzed on a Thermo Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer coupled with a Vanquish UHPLC system. Extracellular acidification (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rates (OCR) were quantified using a Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Glycolysis/citric acid cycle (TCA) rates were measured using isotope-labelled glucose incorporation assays. Transcriptome analyses defined 1,204 differentially expressed (DE) genes in NAM-NK vs. control NK. Biological/functional enrichment and pathway analyses of DE-genes predicted upregulation of cell cycle, DNA replication (CDK4/CDKN2D, CyclinD/E, MAD2L), RNA transcription, translation (SMN1/2, ABCF1, EIF4B, RPL13, RPS6), protein synthesis (EIF2, PABPC1, SOS, 60S complex) mitochondrial energy metabolism (NDUFB8, ATP5G2/E, COX7B/C) migration, homing (CD62L, CD44, DNAM1), and cytokine/chemokine response (IL18R, CXCR3, CCR5, XCL1, SOCS3, LFA1) pathways, with concomitant downregulation of cell exhaustion, senescence (BATF1, FOXP1, STAT1, CD86, LGALS9, LAG3), apoptosis, necrosis (CASP1, MDM2, IKK3), stress response (CALR, HSP90, HSPH1), and lymphoid cellular maturation (IL-2Ra, CD40L, GATA3) pathways in NAM-NK. Metabolomic analyses showed a significant increase of intracellular NAD, NADH, NADP, NADPH, high-energy triphosphates (ATP, UTP, GTP) and overall energy charge ([ATP+0.5*ADP]/[ATP+ADP+AMP]) in NAM-NK. Cellular metabolic fitness analyses revealed increased basal and ATP-linked respiration, mitochondrial maximal respiratory capacity, and glycolytic capacity in NAM-NK compared to control NK. In addition, NAM increased the rate of glucose incorporation into TCA cycle intermediates (acetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA), consistent with a more rapid glycolysis rate, increased TCA cycling, and improved glucose consumption efficiency. Taken together, results of transcriptome, metabolomic, mitochondrial respiration, and glycolytic rate analyses suggest that NAM pleiotropically modulates key cellular metabolic functions in ex vivo -expanded NK cells, resulting in increased response to cytokine stimulation and enhanced potency. NAM inhibits differentiation, cellular stress, and exhaustion pathways that are typically activated in culture. Moreover, NAM increases cellular metabolic fitness, energy charge, and efficiency of glucose consumption, potentially imparting a protective effect against oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment. These data offer insight into the mechanism of improved persistence, proliferation, and cytotoxicity observed in in vivo and clinical studies of GDA-201.
