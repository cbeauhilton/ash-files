    "abstract_text": "We ran a study on the prevalence of anemia in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), southern Brazil. RS is in a sub-tropical Latin American area, near Uruguay and Argentina. There is no Malaria, a low prevalence of hemoglobinopaties, and HIV/AIDS. METHODS: Capillary blood of children less then 7 and women from 14 to 30 years of age were tested. Socioeconomic status was determined utilizing the classification designed by the Brazilian Association of Market Research Agencie s for this purpose. A second sample of 1 year old children was submitted to total blood cell count and serum ferritin determination, and in a third group of individuals, total blood count was done along with stool parasitic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 2198 children and 1999 women with capillary blood measured were analyzed. The median prevalence of anemia in the whole state and the median hemoglobin concentration was 45, 4% and 9.90g/dl for children, and 36.1% and 11 g/dl for women, respectively. Of the aforementioned group, before two years of age, 76% were anemic, and anemia prevalence decreased with age, suggesting a nutrition deficiency. There were very few cases of severe anemia. A significant percentage of children and women belong to the middle class, with access to food and medical care. Of the 356 children tested at one year of age, 67% were anemic and of these, 90% had ferritin < 15\u03bcg/L. In the third group of individuals, 31% of 424 children less then 6 years of age were anemic and of these, only 13% tested positive for parasitic infection. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is very high and constitutes a severe public health problem for 1 year old children in RS, and probably for those younger then 7, and for fertile women as well, irrespectively of their socioeconomic level. Micronutrients supplementation has being neglected in RS health system. The definition of anemia plays a central role in this and has to be addressed if we want to overcome the biologic factors involved in childhood psychosocial development in Brazil."
