    "abstract_text": "In order to detect the CTAs expression in the cell lines and in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detects the mRNA expression of MAGE-C1/CT7, SSX1, SSX2 and SSX4 in MM cell lines RPMI8226 and U266 and patients. Collect clinical MM patients with bone marrow specimens of 25 cases,18 cases of healthy volunteers as a control, The expression frequency in MM patients of CTA gene is parametric statistical analysis with age,gender,the amount of plasma cells,clinical stage and MM type. The CTA members we detected all express in RPMI8226 and U266 cell lines, the expression frequencies of MAGE-C1/CT7 of SSX1, SSX2 and SSX4 in 25 cases bone marrow of MM patients are as follows: 28%\uff087/25\uff09\u300180%\uff0820/25\uff09\u300140%\uff0810/25\uff09\u300168%\uff0817/25\uff09. 18 cases of healthy volunteers with bone marrow does not express the gene. Four kinds of genes in the bone marrow of patients with simultaneous expression of two or more frequency 80%\uff0820/25\uff09, at least have an expression of the frequency 88%\uff0822/25\uff09. Expression of SSX1 and SSX4 in different disease stage was statistically significant( P <0.05), expression frequency was mainly for patients in the phase \u2162higher than\u2160and \u2161. Expression of MAGE-C1/CT7 and SSX2 in the period of disease was not statistically significant( P \ufe650.05), Detected by the four CTA with age, gender, MM type and the volume of plasma cells was no significant difference( P \ufe650.05). It was suggested MAGE-C1/CT7, SSX1, SSX2 and SSX4 gene in MM cell lines RPMI8226 and U266 and MM patients can co-express, while do not express in healthy people. In the expression frequency, SSX1 and SSX4 relate with MM clinical stage,MAGE-C1/CT7 and SSX2 do not relate with clinical stage,the 4 CTAs do not relate with gender,age,clinical type and volume of plasma cells. it provides theoretical support for the CTA vaccine in multiple myeloma immunotherapy.
