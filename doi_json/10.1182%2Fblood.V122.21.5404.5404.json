    "abstract_text": "Background Despite the major advances in the therapy of MM, many patients ultimately relapse and die of this disease. This is most likely due to the persistence of multiple myeloma stem cells (MMSCs), which survive even after the most intensive treatments and are insensitive to non-transplant therapy. We have previously demonstrated that RAR\u03b12 expression increased in CD138 selected plasma cells of relapsed myelomas (MM) and that increased expression was linked to poor prognosis in newly diagnosed MM patients. In this study, we further explore the relationship between RAR\u03b12 and MMSCs. Materials and Methods RT-PCR was used to detect RAR\u03b12, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS) gene, Wnt and Hedgehog (Hh) gene expression in MMSCs and bulk cells. Clonogenic formation assays were performed by plating RAR\u03b12 over-expressing ARP1 and OCI-MY5 MM cell lines in soft agar, treated with bortezomib, doxorubicin, etoposide, and MK-571. Side population (SP) fraction, ALDH activity and cell apoptosis in MM cells were detected by flow cytometry. Western blot were utilized to dissect RAR\u03b12-related signaling pathway. Effect of RAR\u03b12 on MM progression in vivo was also analyzed in 5TGM1 myeloma mice. Results Higher expression of RAR\u03b12 was identified in the multiple myeloma stem cell (MMSC) fraction. Over-expression of RAR\u03b12 in MM cell lines resulted in 1) increased drug-resistance 2) increased clonogenic potential 3) activation of both Wnt and Hedgehog (Hh) pathways 4) increased side population (SP) and aldehyde dehydrogenase1 (ALDH1) levels and 5) increased expression of iPS genes. The opposite effects were seen with RAR\u03b12 knockdown. RAR\u03b12 induced drug resistance by activating the drug efflux pump gene ABCC3 and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Inhibition of Wnt signaling or ABCC3 function could overcome drug resistance in RAR\u03b12 over-expressing MM cells. Our In vivo study indicated that targeting Wnt and Hh pathways using CAY10404, cyclopamine or itraconazole could significantly reduce tumor burden and increase survival time in the 5TGM1 mouse model. We confirmed these findings in primary myeloma stem cells. Finally, we showed that primary myelomas with high RAR\u03b12 expression possess similar features as myeloma stem cells. Conclusion This study demonstrates that RAR\u03b12 plays a crucial role in MMSCs by activating Wnt and Hh pathways, regulating the transcription of iPS genes and conferring drug resistance.
