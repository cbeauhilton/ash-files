    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3605 Poster Board III-541 The Polycomb group (PcG) protein Bmi1 maintains silencing of the Ink4a-Arf locus and plays a key role in stem cell self-renewal and oncogenesis. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt (PI3K-Akt) signaling pathway regulates cell survival, growth, metabolism, migration and angiogenesis. In response to acute Pten loss (which results in Akt activation), mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mefs) accumulate p16Ink4a and p19Arf and undergo senescence. Similarly, Bmi1 \u2212/\u2212 mefs undergo premature senescence and accumulate p16Ink4a and p19Arf. PTEN and Bmi1 have similar effects on hematopoiesis; Pten deletion promotes hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation, resulting in HSC depletion, whereas loss of Bmi1 impairs HSC self-renewal capability, also leading to bone marrow failure. These similarities led us to examine whether the PI3K/Akt pathway functions upstream of Bmi1 to negatively regulate its function and indeed we found that PKB/Akt phosphorylates Bmi1 in vivo, which results in its dissociation from chromatin and in de-repression of the Ink4a-Arf locus. Furthermore, activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway suppresses the ability of Bmi1 to promote cell growth and tumourigenesis and decreases the global level of histone H2A ubiquitination. PI3K/Akt signaling is not active in hematopoietic stem cells, but it is active in more committed progenitor cells. Thus, phosphorylation and inactivation of Bmi1 by Akt may limit HSC self-renewal. Our study also provides a mechanism for the upregulation of p16Ink4a and p19Arf seen in cancer cells that have activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and identifies important crosstalk between phosphorylation and chromatin structure.
