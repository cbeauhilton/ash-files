    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3311 Poster Board III-199 BACKGROUND After allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) have the potential to generate a desirable graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, but bear the risk of eliciting a noxious graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). To minimize the risk of a GVHD and to improve the GVL effect, a positive selection of leukemia (antigen)-specific T cells would be highly desirable. In this study we focused on the leukemia-antigen Wilms Tumor gene 1 (WT1). In patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a good correlation of WT1 expression and the number of leukemia blasts could be demonstrated. Several groups described immunogenic T cell epitopes derived from the WT1 protein. MATERIAL AND METHODS Here, we used the technology of streptamers available on a GMP level to detect the frequency of HLA-A2 restricted CD8+ T cells in the nai\u0308ve peripheral blood (PB) from both healthy donors (HDs) and AML patients. Such WT1-specific CD8+ T cells were further characterized for the expression of CD27, CD28, CD45RA, CCR7 and CD107a. In the next step, WT1-specific cells were positive selected by magnetic cell separation (MACS\u2122) columns after labeling with streptamers or tetramers and thereafter immunophenotyped. Moreover, mixed lymphocyte peptide cultures (MLPCs) were performed to enrich WT1-specific T cells derived from the PB of HDs. At last, WT1 specific T cells were evaluated in CFSE-based proliferation and cytotoxicity assays. Streptamer selected WT1-specific CD8+ T cells were compared with tetramer selected WT1-specific CD8+ T cells. RESULTS 21 of 40 HDs showed nai\u0308ve WT1 specific T cell frequencies of 0.5 to 2.0% of all CD8+ T cells. In two of ten AML patients, also 0.4 to 3.6% of WT1-specific T cells could be detected. Through streptamer based MACS\u2122, a purity of more than 90% of all CD8+ T cells could be achieved for WT1-specific CD8+ T cells. These cells revealed to be CD8+WT1 _Streptamer+CD28+ CD45RA+CD69-CD107a+CCR7-CD137- effector T cells in flow cytometry. Proliferation assays proved that the streptamer technology does not alter the proliferative potential of the WT1-specific CD8+ T cells. In cytotoxicity assays, WT1-specific CD8+ T cells after streptamer selection were able to lyse HLA-A2+WT1+ cells at an effector/target ratio of 20:1. No significant difference between streptamer and tetramer selection could be found for the phenotype, as well as for the proliferative and cytotoxic potential of the cells. After a maximum of three rounds of MLPC, only a frequency of 2-5% could be achieved, thus demonstrating the power of the streptamer technology. CONCLUSION In summary, the streptamer technology allows to select a highly purified fraction of WT1-specific effector T cells with proliferative and cytotoxic properties. In analogy to DLIs specific for viral antigens, production of leukemia specific DLIs is feasible on a GMP level. Further leukemia antigens are currently evaluated by our group.
