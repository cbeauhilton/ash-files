    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3195 The hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) is the consequence of impaired switching in adult life, which results in the continued expression of gamma globin gene. The Brazilian HPFH type is characterized by a C \u2192 G substitution at the \u2013195 position of the A gamma globin gene promoter, and associated with HbF levels ranging from 6 to 16% in the heterozygote state. This study was undertaken to identify genes that may be involved in hemoglobin switching and/or maintenance of elevated HbF levels in Brazilian HPHF subjects. The Suppressive Subtractive Hybridization libraries were constructed using a pool of RNA extracted from reticulocytes of peripheral blood in individuals with normal hematological data and from subjects with Brazilian and 55 and 57 overexpressed genes were identified in the normal and Brazilian HPFH library, respectively; findings were validated by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. One transcription factor identified was FOXO3a , whose expression was increased in Brazilian HPFH subjects, compared to control subjects. Moreover, the non-phosphorylated Foxo3a protein that interacts with DNA, was detected only in Brazilian HPFH when analyzed by Western blotting. FOXO3a binds to PAX1 promoter, a transcription factor whose activity was higher in Brazilian HPFH. The FOXO3a/PAX1 complex may be important in the mechanism responsible for increasing HbF levels in this genetic disorder. Another gene analyzed was KLF1 , a transcription factor known as a regulator of switching from the gamma to beta globin gene. This gene was underexpressed in the reticulocytes of HPFH subjects. Klf1 protein activity in erythroid cells of healthy donors was also increased compared to Brazilian HPFH, when analyzed by DNA/protein array. Results suggest that the decreased KLF1 levels in Brazilian HPFH favors the interaction between the A gamma globin gene and the Locus Control Region, agreeing with previous studies that demonstrated that knockdown of KLF1 in adult erythroid progenitors favors the formation of complexes that bind to the gamma globin gene promoter. MIER1 expression was also found to be decreased in Brazilian HPFH reticulocytes, compared to controls. The MIER1 gene is able to recruit chromatin remodeling-enzymes leading, to the formation of heterochromatin and, consequently, silencing genes. This MIER1 may be an important gene in gamma to beta globin gene switching, where it could help in the maintenance of a closed chromatin structure in the gamma globin gene in individuals with low HbF levels. The expression of the HOOK3 gene was decreased in Brazilian HPFH reticulocytes, compared to controls. The HOOK3 encodes a protein that interacts with a GTPase protein, stimulating INF-gamma, responsible for the phosphorylation of p65/p50 and RXR beta like proteins which regulate the transcription of the beta globin gene. The reduced beta globin gene expression in Brazilian HPFH resulting from the reactivation of gamma globin gene may be responsible for a decrease in the HOOK3 expression. These results suggest that, in the HPFH Brazilian type, the FOXO3a/PAX1 complex could contribute to the continued expression of the A gamma globin gene. Additionally, some cellular modifications, such as low Klf1 activity and decreased HOOK3 and MIER1 expression, could participate in the maintenance of HbF levels. These genes could be important in therapeutic approaches for the development of new HbF induction agents for the hemoglobinopathies.
