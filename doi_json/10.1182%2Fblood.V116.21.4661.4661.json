A deficiency of the metalloprotease ADAMTS 13, which cleaves a Tys1605-Met1606 bond in the A2 subunit of von Willebrand factor (VWF), leads to formation of ultra large von Willebrand multimers (UL-VWF) and can cause platelet aggregation and mircovascular thrombosis. Treatment of choice is the substitution of plasma with plasmaexchange. There are two different plasma types available: Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and solvent/detergent (s/d) treated plasma. This treatment may carry significant risks and side effects for the patients. Therefore we investigated the side effects of the therapy and furthermore the ADAMTS13 activity of the two plasma types. Methods: A questionnaire was send to 66 TTP patients of the Department of Hematology to evaluate different side effects of the therapy. 20 batches of FFP and 4 batches of s/d plasma of all blood groups were investigated on ADAMTS13 activity. The ADAMTS13 activity was detected with BCS-Method according to Bo\u0308hm and two commercial FRET assays. Results: So far 34 patients were inquired about age, weight and suspected trigger situations that might have caused their TTP manifestation. The mean age of the patients was 34 years with a mean weight of 70kg. A previous infection caused TTP manifestation in 42% of the patients; drug therapy (22%) and pregnancy (17%) were other mentioned triggers. 94% of the patients suffered from an acquired TTP and only 6% had a hereditary TTP. The patients had 2.88 relapses and were treated with 16.27 plasmaexchanges. 56% had an additional therapy with Rituximab to achieve a faster remission of the disease. These patients needed less plasmaexchanges for recovery, which proofed to be significant at 2% level in a one sided t-test. Tingling (64.7%) and shivering (51%) were the most often mentioned side effects and simultaneously described as the strongest. Shivering was significantly correlated to tachycardia (p<0.01). Headaches were significantly correlated to hot flushes, tingling and collapse (p< 0.05). Side effects and allergic reactions occurred in the therapy with FFP as well as with s/d plasma. Another side effect was the complication that came along with infection of the venous access. Most patients had a central venous catheter (72%) and described infections and pruritus (60%), 50% of them mentioned this complication more than once. We found in usual FFP slightly higher ADAMTS13 activity levels (696.97 ng/ml) than in s/d virus inactivated plasma (643.86 ng/ml). The ADAMTS13 activity varied between the different assays (normal range: 666 \u00b1 135ng/ml). Conclusion: Our investigation demonstrated that plasmaexchange therapy is still associated with a wide range of side effects. Side effects of plasmaexchange that were most frequently described by patients were tingling and shivering. Headaches also occurred in various cases. Patients suffered generally from more than one side effect at the same time during the treatment. Allergic reactions to the plasma therapy were mentioned by 65% of the patients.
