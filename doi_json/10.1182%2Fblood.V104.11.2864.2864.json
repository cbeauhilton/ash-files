    "abstract_text": "T cells are either nai\u0308ve, having never encountered cognate antigen, or memory, with a history of activation, proliferation, and acquistion of effector specialization including tissue specific homing properties. We hypothesized that memory T cells would contain a subpopulation of alloantigen specific cells that might have acquired tissue specific homing characteristics such as upregulation of \u03b14\u03b27 integrin that directs T cells to gut lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissue. In mice, \u03b14\u03b27 integrin dependent migration to the peyer\u2019s patch is essential to instigate lethal GVHD in MHC mismatched BMT models. To test this hypothesis, immunomagnetic sorting for CD45RO and CD45RA was used to obtain populations either depleted or enriched for nai\u0308ve T cells respectively. Using CFDA dye dilution and CD69 upregulation, alloantigen specific T cells were tracked with flow cytometry at days 3, 5, and 7 of a mixed lymphocyte reaction, with an autologous control. ModFit LT software was used to estimate precursor frequencies, which showed that approximately 1 in 200 CD4 and CD8 positive T cells are alloreactive (n=9) regardless of whether they were CD45RO or CD45RA selected, demonstrating that alloreactivity could be potentially recruited from either the nai\u0308ve or memory donor pool in a GVHD reaction. Analysis of \u03b14\u03b27 integrin coexpression before alloantigen stimulation demonstrated that for both CD4 and CD8 positive T cells, the memory pool had two-fold higher levels of coexpression that were statistically significant compared to the naive pool, with CD8 memory T cells demonstrating the highest coexpression (24 +/\u2212 12%). When examined at day 5 of the MLR, both CD4 and CD8 positive alloantigen specific T cells from the CD45RO selected group maintained levels of \u03b14\u03b27 integrin coexpression similar to baseline (14% and 25% respectively). In contrast, CD4 and CD8 positive alloantigen specific T cells from the CD45RA selected group had levels of \u03b14\u03b27 integrin coexpression that were four-fold higher compared to baseline, with 20% and 48% coexpression respectively (n=6). The relative contribution of \u03b14 and \u03b27 integrins was examined by comparing the mean flourescent intensity (MFI) of the alloantigen specific T cells to the resting T cells within the same day 5 MLR. The greatest increase in expression was seen for \u03b27 integrin on the CD45RA selected CD4 and CD8 positive T cells with 3.1 and 3.2 times higher expression respectively (both p<.001). In contrast, the CD45RO selected CD4 and CD8 positive T cells had 1.78 (p<.01) and 1.35 (p<.05) times higher \u03b27 expression levels respectively. With regard to \u03b14 integrin expression, CD45RA selected CD4 and CD8 positive T cells had 2.2 and 2.0 times higher expression respectively (both p<.01). The \u03b14 integrin expression on CD45RO selected CD4 and CD8 positive T cells was 2.0 (p<.05) and 1.43 (p= NS) times higher respectively. These data suggest that both nai\u0308ve and memory CD4 and CD8 positive T cells may contribute to alloreactivity, although there are differences in the regulation of \u03b14\u03b27 integrin expression which could significantly affect in vivo T cell homing and therefore instigation of GVHD. Based upon murine studies, it has been demonstrated that memory T cells do not contribute to GVHD; our data suggest in contrast that human memory T cells could contribute in a significant way to GVHD and further study is necessary before development of successful T cell manipulation strategies aimed at attenuating GVHD.",
