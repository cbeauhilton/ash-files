    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4542 Immunosuppressive treatment is widely used, especially after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to prevent or treat graft versus host disease (GvHD). Common drugs are Ciclosporin A or Tacrolimus in combination with steroids. However, immunosuppressive treatment and the underlying conditions are associated with an increased risk of viral reactivations with persistent pathogens like cytomegalovirus or adenovirus. In the absence of a protective immune response, virus infection remains a life-threatening complication after HSCT. Here we investigated the antiviral T-cell response (n=12) after ex vivo exposition with Ciclosporin A, Tacrolimus, Prednisolone or Mycophenolate at time of immunosuppression, 24 hours and 72 hours later. Analysis has been done with IFNgamma Elispot assays, confirmed by intracellular cytokine staining in flow cytometry and analysis of T-cell proliferation detected by CFSE. The antiviral T-cell response is suppressed after 24 hours using normal serum concentrations (100-200ng/ml) of cyclosporine A. T-cell annergy, induced by cyclosporine, could be reversible, after 72 without immunosuppression. Tacrolimus has a stronger immunosuppressive effect on T-cell activation within the same time and even low levels of 1ng/ml induce T-cell suppression after 72 hours. Peak levels of calcineurin inhibitors even suppressed the T-cell response to superantigens like staphylococcal antigen B or PHA. As expected, Prednisolone had a short and dose dependend effect on T-cell activation. Mycophenolate has a mild effect on the activation of virus-specific T-cells. However, all three drugs induced a significant reduction in Ag-specific T-cell proliferation. In conclusion, Interferon\u03b3 detection in virus-specific T-cells is a good diagnostic tool for clinicians to monitor the risk of viral complications in immunosuppressed patients. Tacrolimus, Cyclosporin A, Prednisolone and Mycophenolate induce an activation defect in Ag-specific T-cells with decreasing severity. The effect is reversible and corresponds to high or low serum levels. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
