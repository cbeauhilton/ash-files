    "abstract_text": "Abstract 681 Granzyme B (GZMB) is a serine protease with important roles mediating target-cell apoptosis induced by natural killer cells and cytotoxic CD8 + T cells. The polymorphism rs8192917 (A55G) in the GZMB gene has been reportedly associated with the ability of effector cells to secrete GZMB. In this study we analyzed the impact of GZMB polymorphism on transplant outcomes in patients undergoing unrelated HLA-fully-matched myeloablative bone marrow transplantation (BMT) through the Japan Marrow Donation Program. The GZMB genotypes were retrospectively analyzed in a cohort of 360 pairs of patients with hematologic malignancies and their unrelated donors. The presence of the G/G genotype in the donor side was associated with a significantly higher incidence of relapse (62% vs. 32%, P =0.04; Fig 1 ). Multivariate analysis revealed that the donor G/G genotype, which is expected to produce lower levels of GZMB after stimulation, (Girnita et al, Transplantation 2009) was an independent risk factor for relapse (hazard ratio, 4.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.63 to 10.70; P =0.003). The host GZMB genotypes did not significantly influence the transplant outcomes. These results suggest an association of low GZMB secretors with disease relapse. These could therefore be useful in selecting the donor and creating therapeutic strategies for improving the final outcome of allogeneic BMT.
