    "abstract_text": "Leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium contributes to vaso-occlusion and widespread organ damage in sickle cell disease (SCD). Previously, we found high expression of the adhesion molecules \u03b1M\u03b22 integrin and L-selectin in HbSS individuals with severe disease. The n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (FA) are vital structural and functional components of cell and sub-cellular membranes. They modulate cell adhesion, inflammation, aggregation and vascular tone. We investigated the FA composition of mononuclear cells (MNC) and platelets of HbSS patients in steady-state (n = 28); and racially matched, healthy HbAA controls (n = 13). MNC phospholipids of the patients had low levels of docosahexanoic acid (DHA, p<0.01), n-3 metabolites (p<0.05) and total n-3 polyunsaturated FA (p<0.05); table 1. In contrast, arachidonic (AA, p<0.005), AA:DHA ratio (p<0.005, fig 1 ) and total n-6 metabolites (p<0.05) were increased in the patients. Similarly, platelets from HbSS patients had low levels of eicosapentanoic acid (EPA, p<0.05), and raised AA (p<0.05) in choline phosphoglycerides (CPG); with reduced linoleic acid (LA, p<0.005) and DHA (p<0.05) in ethanolamine phosphoglycerides. Platelet CPG had lower DHA levels in HbSS individuals with complications of SCD compared to those who had no complications (p<0.05, fig.2). Reduced EPA and DHA relative to AA favours the production of aggregatory and pro-inflmmatory eicosanoids that activate leukocytes and platelets. This may lead to enhanced inflammation, leukocyte adhesion, platelet aggregation and vaso-occlusion in SCD.
