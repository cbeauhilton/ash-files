    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3202 Eight missense mutations in the ectodomain of glycoprotein (GP)Ib\u03b2 have been identified in patients with Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) that is characterized by the deficiency of functional GPIb-IX complex on the platelet surface, clearly highlighting the importance of GPIb\u03b2 ectodomain in assembly of the GPIb-IX complex. To understand the molecular pathogenesis of these mutations, we have characterized their effects on the expression, secretion, folding of the isolated GPIb\u03b2 ectodomain as well as its interaction with GPIX ectodomain in the context of full-length complex. Each of the 8 mutations \u2014 C5Y, R17C, P29L, N64T, P74R, Y88C, P96S, and A108P \u2014 was constructed into genes encoding HA-tagged GPIb\u03b2 ectodomain or full-length GPIb\u03b2 subunit, and the mutant gene transfected transiently, along with GPIba and GPIX genes if desired, into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Flow cytometry and Western blot analysis indicated that while all 8 mutations impeded formation of the disulfide bonds between GPIba and GPIb\u03b2 and significantly decreased the surface expression level of GPIb-IX complex comparing to the wild-type, the extent of disruption varies with each mutation. Further characterization in the context of isolated GPIb\u03b2 ectodomain revealed that the majority of 8 mutations \u2014 C5Y, R17C, P29L, N64T, Y88C, P96S \u2014 are detrimental to proper folding of the GPIb\u03b2 ectodomain, resulting in secretion defects and/or domain misfolding. In contrast, two mutations, P74R and A108P, preserved structural integrity of the GPIb\u03b2 ectodomain since the mutant ectodomains exhibited wild-type-like secretion levels and formed no inter-molecular disulfide bonds. However, neither of the two mutations, in the context of full-length GPIb\u03b2, were able to support surface expression of GPIX in transfected CHO cells as the wild-type, indicating that P74R and A108P disrupt the interaction between GPIb\u03b2 and GPIX ectodomains. Thus, our results demonstrated although all 8 BSS mutations in GPIb\u03b2 share the same phenotype, they impair expression of the GPIb-IX complex by two different mechanisms \u2014 disrupting folding of the GPIb\u03b2 ectodomain or disrupting interactions between GPIb-IX subunits. Furthermore, our results suggest that Pro74 and Ala108 may be located in the interfacial region between GPIb\u03b2 and GPIX ectodomains, helping to shed light on the structure of GPIb-IX complex.
