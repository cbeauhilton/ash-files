    "abstract_text": "In aggressive disease, the CLL cells usually express the 70-kD zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70). We used immunohistochemical techniques and routinely fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue to survey ZAP-70 expression in patients (pts) with CLL who received a NMT, as previously described ( Modem Pathol  17 : 954 , 2004 ). All cases were reviewed independently by two authors. Cytoplasmic staining of non-neoplastic, reactive T cells served as an internal control in each case. Neoplasms (Pax-5 +) demonstrating ZAP-70 cytoplasmic staining in greater than 20% of tumor cells were considered positive. Pts were eligible for NMT if they had failed fludarabine-based conventional therapy. The conditioning regimen prior to NMT consisted of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab. Twenty nine pts were treated. The pts characteristics and outcome were as follows:  . ZAP-70 Negative . ZAP-70 Positive . P value . No. Pts 8 19  Age (range) 58 (45\u201369) yrs 53 (34\u201372) yrs 0.36 Time Dx to NMT 4.5 yrs 4.5 yrs 0.6 No. Prior Chemoregimens 3 (2\u20135) 3 (2\u20138) 0.7 No. Pts in Richter 1 6 0.3 Status at NMT CR/PR/NR 1/3/4 1/12/6 0.18 Donor:    Matched Sibling 7 16 0.6 Unrelated 1 3  #Pts requiring DLI 3 9 0.4 Final Response    CR/PR 6/1 15/0 0.6 NR/NE 1/0 3/1  Relapse Post CR 1 0  Follow-up Time 11 (9\u201347) mos 37 (13\u201375) mos  Survival    1.5- year 83% 84% 0.7 4- year NA 64%  Current PFS 56% (1.5 yr) 65% (4 yr)  Causes of Death PD(1), cGVHD(1) PD(2), cGVHD(2), Infection(2)  GVHD grade II\u2013IV 37% 39%  .

Controlled trials are needed to confirm these results in a larger number of patients.",
