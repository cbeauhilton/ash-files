    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3409 Stem cells reside in a physical niche, a particular microenvironment. The organization of cellular niches has been shown to play a key role in regulating normal stem cell differentiation, stem cell maintenance and regeneration. Various stem cell niches have been shown to be hypoxic, thereby maintaining the stem cell phenotype, e.g. for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or cancer stem cells. The bone marrow (BM) niche is a rich reservoir for tissue-specific pluripotent HSCs. Proteases, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can modulate stem cell fate due to their proteolytic or non-proteolytic functions (abilities). We have investigated the role of membrane-type1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), known for its role in pericellular matrix remodeling and cell migration, in hematopoiesis. MT1-MMP is highly expressed in HSCs and stromal cells. In MT1-MMP\u2212/\u2212 mice, release of kit ligand (KitL), stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12), erythropoietin (Epo) and interleukin-7 were impaired resulting in erythroid, myeloid and T and B lymphoid differentiation. Addition of exogenous rec. KitL and rec. SDF-1 restored hematopoiesis in vivo and in vitro . Further mechanistic studies revealed that MT1-MMP in a non-proteolytic manner activates the HIF-1 pathway, thereby inducing the transcription of the HIF-responsive genes KitL , SDF-1 and Epo . These results suggested MT1-MMP as a critical regulator of postnatal hematopoiesis, which as a modulator of the HIF pathway alters critical hematopoietic niche factors necessary for terminal differentiation and or migration. Thus, our results indicate that MT1-MMP as a key molecular link between hypoxia and the regulation of vital HSC niche factors. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
