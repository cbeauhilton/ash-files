    "abstract_text": "Myelodysplasia (MDS) is a clonal hematopoietic disorder that leads to ineffective hematopoiesis and peripheral cytopenias. DNMT inhibitors such as azacytidine have led to clinical responses in patients, though global epigenetic alterations in MDS have not been well described. The transmission of these epigenetic marks during hematopoietic differentiation and their role in disease pathophysiology is also unknown. We first compared global methylation profiles of 8 bone marrow samples with peripheral leucocytes by using a recently described novel method, the HELP assay (HpaII tiny fragment Enrichment by Ligation-mediated PCR; Khulan et al, Genome Res. 2006 Aug;16(8)) that uses differential methylation-specific digestion by HpaII and MspI followed by amplification, two color labeling and hybridization to quantitatively determine individual promoter CpG island methylation. A whole genome human promoter array (Nimblegen) was used to determine the level of methylation of 25626 gene promoters by calculating HpaII/MspI cut fragment intensity ratio. We observed a high correlation (r=0.89\u20130.96) of epigenetic marks between bone marrow and peripheral blood samples suggesting that a majority of epigenetic marks can be also be seen in differentiated cells. We subsequently compared peripheral blood leucocytes from 20 patients with MDS with 10 age-matched normal and anemic controls. Parallel gene expression analysis was performed using 37K oligo maskless arrays on cDNA from the same samples. Analysis showed that whole genome methylation profiling has greater discriminatory power in separating clusters of MDS samples from normal and anemic controls when compared to gene expression analysis. Epigenetic profiling demonstrated two clusters of MDS based on similarity of aberrant epigenetic changes. Overall, there was a trend towards hypermethylation in MDS, albeit not statistically significant given the large number of relatively unchanged genes. Detailed analysis revealed several novel differentially methylated genes that had corresponding changes in gene expression, when MDS samples were compared to the controls with a low false discovery rate of analysis. Interesting genes getting hypomethylated and overexpressed included TNF superfamily member 9, granulocyte pep A, microsomal glutathione S-transferase, homeo box B4, mitochondrial RPL11, and others. Similarly, the set of genes that were getting hypermethylated with associated decrease in gene expression included Evi-1, DAPK, HOXB3, Protein Phosphatase 1, CEBPB, mutated in colorectal cancer (MCC), myeloid-lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia 5 (MLL5), plasminogen-related protein B, ovarian cancer related protein 1 (ORP1), and others. In addition, we did array-based comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) to look at exact genome copy number changes in these samples. We found changes that were not detectable by conventional karyotyping in all samples. Commonly seen alterations were del(14q11), del(20q11), del(5q13), del(8p23), amp(1q42), amp(5q11), amp(17q12), amp(19q13) and amp(7q22). Integrative analysis revealed sets of genes that were either silenced by methylation or deletion in different patients. Thus, our data demonstrates that promoter DNA methylation changes are an important phenomenon in MDS evolution, and are associated with changes in expression of genes playing important roles in cancer development and/or progression. We also show that previously unrecognizable changes in copy number exist in most patients with MDS. In addition, our work shows that whole genome methylation assays, even when done on peripheral blood leukocytes, can be used for potential biomarker studies in the diagnosis of MDS.",
