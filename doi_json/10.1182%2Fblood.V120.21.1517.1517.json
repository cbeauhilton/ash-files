    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1517 Purpose: Decitabine, a deoxycytidine nucleoside derivative, is an inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferases indicated for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) including previously treated and untreated, de novo or secondary MDS of all French-American-British (FAB) subtypes, Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, and High-Risk International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) groups. Laboratory evidence shows that pretreatment of AML cell lines can sensitize leukemia cells to chemotherapy as well as inhibit clonogenic potential. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of decitabine when used as priming before induction therapy in children with newly diagnosed AML. Exploratory analyses of genomic methylation and RNA expression patterns and minimal residual disease (MRD) are embedded correlative studies. Methods: This multicenter, randomized, two-arm, open-label study enrolls pediatric pts ages 1\u201316 with newly diagnosed AML to either Arm A: daunorubicin, cytarabine, etoposide (D-ADE) preceded by a 5-day course of decitabine (experimental arm) or Arm B: daunorubicin, cytarabine, etoposide (ADE; control arm). Following completion of induction on study, post-induction therapy is at the treating physician's discretion. To date, 20 pts, 10 in each arm (1\u201316 yrs, median 9.4 yrs in both arms) have been enrolled. Results: At the protocol-specified bone marrow sampling time 3 weeks post-induction, there were 2 CRs, 6 CRi (CR with incomplete hematopoietic recovery), 1 leukemia not in remission and 1 pt who discontinued due to an AE in Arm A. In Arm B, 6 CRs, 2CRi, 1 PR and 1 pt with marrow aplasia have been confirmed. Decitabine PK in all arm A pts (100%) were characterized by mean+SD C max , 297+109 ng/mL, AUC 0-t , 216+73.7 ng*h/mL, CL, 136+93.9L/h, Vd ss 93.1+70.7 L, t 1/2 0.456+0.073 h, and median t max 0.925 h. All pts had at least one AE. Grade 3 and 4 non-hematologic AEs in Arm A that were not seen in Arm B were caecitis in 2 (20%), anorexia in 3 (30%), and hypophosphatemia in 2 (20%) of pts. All pts experienced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia as expected. One pt in Arm A had appendicitis and colon perforation on Day 6 that led to study discontinuation, later determined to have been leukemic infiltrate. Two pts have died to date (both in Arm A), one of necrotic bowel, Pseudomonas sepsis and multisystem organ failure 6 months after completing study induction therapy. One pt died 5 months following study treatment from multisystem organ failure after stem cell transplant. Epigenetic changes associated with decitabine pretreatment were analyzed and will be presented. Conclusions: Decitabine in combination with ADE chemotherapy is well tolerated in children with newly diagnosed AML. There were no AEs that had not been previously identified in adults with MDS or AML. No differences have been observed between treatment arms in hematologic toxicities based on the current sample size. To date, the decitabine-treated pts in this study may have more gastrointestinal toxicity and hypophosphatemia. Decitabine-treated pts achieved PK exposures that were similar to those observed in adults treated with decitabine. Preliminary responses by CR/CRi were similar between treatment arms; expected adverse events of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were similar between both Arms. Molecular changes associated with decitabine pretreatment may be important in the sensitization of clonogenic AML cells. Total accrual of 40 subjects is planned.
