    "abstract_text": "Despite recent advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), including the introduction of bortezimib, it remains an incurable disease with a short median survival. The development of new agents with efficacy in MM therefore remains both important and urgent. SJG-136 (SG2000, BN2629) is a novel DNA cross-linking agent that binds in a sequence-selective manner in the minor groove of the DNA helix. It is structurally novel compared with other clinically used DNA cross-linking agents and has exhibited a unique pattern of activity in the NCI 60-cell line screen. We have previously shown that this agent is highly effective against primary chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells. In this study we evaluated its potential as a therapy for MM in cell lines and plasma cells derived from patients. The MM cell lines H929, U266 and JJN3 were shown to have a mean LD 50 of 5.1nM (\u00b13.4) following in vitro culture with SJG-136 for 48 hours. This was accompanied by a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells as evidenced by Annexin V positivity and caspase-3 activation. In comparison to the standard therapies for MM, SJG-136 demonstrated significantly lower LD 50 values than doxorubicin (P=0.004), Melphalan (P=0.004) and bortezimib (P=0.03). We also assessed the ability of SJG-136 to kill plasma cells from primary myeloma samples (identified by CD38 and CD138 positivity). These cells were sensitive to SJG-136 with a mean LD 50 of 2.3nM (\u00b1 0.96) following 48 hour exposures to SJG-136. In contrast, normal bone marrow was significantly less affected by SJG-136 than the myeloma samples (P<0.0001). Finally, we assessed the potential for synergy between SJG-136 and these standard treatments using the H929 cell line as a model. SJG-136 was combined with doxorubicin (1:125), melphalan (1:4000) and bortezimib (1:8) and the combination index (CI) was calculated to assess synergy. A CI of less than 1 was considered synergistic. We found no evidence for synergy between SJG-136 and doxorubicin or melphalan (CI=1.29 and 1.75 respectively). However, SJG-136 was synergistic with bortezimib (CI=0.47) possibly reflecting their different mechanisms of action. In conclusion, SJG-136 is a potentially valuable addition to the battery of drugs available for treatment of MM. Not only was SJG-136 highly potent as a single agent in MM cell lines and primary plasma cells but it also showed a high level of synergy with the proteasome inhibitor bortezimib.",
