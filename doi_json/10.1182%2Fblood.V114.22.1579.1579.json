    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1579 Poster Board I-605 While the prognostic role of FLT3 ITD has been validated in younger CN-AML adults (<60 y), its association with outcome has not been fully investigated in older pts. We studied the frequency and the clinical impact of FLT3 ITD in a cohort of older pts \u226560 y ([n=243; 111 (46%) aged \u226570 y] with de novo CN-AML. Pts were treated on CALGB protocols [10201, 9720, 9420, 8923 and 8525] with cytarabine/anthracycline-based induction and cytarabine-based consolidation. Diagnostic samples were assessed by quantitative fluorescence-based PCR capillary electrophoresis for FLT3 ITD and tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations, and by DHPLC/sequencing analysis for NPM1 and WT1 mutations. Of the 243 pts, 78 (32%) presented with FLT3 ITD, 24 (10%) with FLT3 TKD and 6 (2%) had both. Outcome analyses were restricted to comparison of FLT3 wild-type (WT) pts (n=147) with those with FLT3 ITD alone (n=72). Of these pts, 121 (55%) had NPM1 mutations and 15 (7%) had WT1 mutations. Unfortunately, only a subset of these pts also had available material for BAALC and ERG measurements, thereby preventing analysis of the prognostic significance of FLT3 ITD in the context of a panel of variables that included these markers. Compared with FLT3 WT pts, FLT3 ITD pts had higher WBC counts and % bone marrow and blood blasts ( P <.001, all), and higher frequencies of NPM1 (74% v 46%; P <.001) and WT1 mutations (15% v 3%; P =.001). Complete remission (CR) rates were similar, but disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were shorter in FLT3 ITD v FLT3 WT pts ( Table 1 ). In multivariable analyses (MVA), FLT3 ITD associated with shorter DFS and OS ( Table 2 ). The FLT3 ITD prognostic impact was associated with age. FLT3 ITD pts aged 60-69 y had shorter DFS and OS than FLT3 WT pts, whereas clinical outcomes were not different for \u226570 y FLT3 ITD v FLT3 WT pts ( Table 1 ). In MVA for the 60-69 y subgroup, pts with FLT3 ITD had shorter DFS and OS ( Table 2 ). The reasons for this age-associated effect remain to be explained. In previous studies of younger CN-AML, a higher (\u2265 median) FLT3 ITD:WT allelic ratio (AR) was associated with worse clinical outcome. In the current study, FLT3 ITD had an adverse prognostic impact on the 60-69 y pts and no significant impact on the \u226570 y pts regardless of the AR levels. However, a 27-microRNA (miR) signature differentiating between FLT3 ITD and FLT3 WT pts and characterized by >2-fold higher miR-155 expression in FLT3 ITD pts, was associated with shorter DFS and OS in the 60-69 y pt subgroup ( P =.001, each) but not in the \u226570 y subgroup ( P =.26 and P =.89, respectively), suggesting an age-associated prognostic role of the miRs. In summary, our data show FLT3 ITD is an independent marker for poor outcome in CN-AML pts aged 60-69 y but not in those aged \u226570 y. Although the \u226570 y pts with FLT3 ITD had a seemingly better prognosis than the corresponding 60-69 y pts, the outcome for both groups is poor and novel treatment approaches are needed in older pts.
