    "abstract_text": "Background: Radiation therapy (RT) has been considered the standard of care for front-line management for early-stage follicular lymphoma. Recent data suggests the use of RT is declining with more than half the patients receiving immunochemotherapy (ICT) with or without rituximab maintenance (RM). Cost-effectiveness analysis of these treatments has not been performed. Methods: We constructed a four-state partitioned survival model over a 15-year time horizon to compare RT alone, ICT and ICT+RM. The model was based on a real-world cohort of early-stage FL patients, staged using 1 8 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography,from the Australasian Lymphoma Alliance. Lifetime direct health care costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated from an Australian tax-payer perspective. A pre-specified value of AUD $75,000 was defined as the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold reflecting recent approvals for therapeutics for indolent lymphoproliferative diseases in Australia. Results: Assuming 5% annual discounting the direct healthcare costs were: RT $14,480, ICT $22,171, ICT+RM $42,830 (Table 1). Compared with RT, ICT demonstrated an improvement in QALYs (+0.17) and an ICER of $44,879. Compared with RT, ICT+RM demonstrated a larger improvement in QALYs (+0.53) with an ICER of $53,062. Modelling a 25% cost reduction with a rituximab biosimilar led to further ICER reductions: ICT ($29,078); ICT+RM ($37,810). Conclusion: Although the initial healthcare-associated costs were higher than RT, over a 15-year horizon ICT and ICT+RM are cost-effective treatments in early stage FL from the Australian tax-payer perspective. Although the costs may differ internationally, the results remain broadly generalisable given the costs incurred related to time in the failure-free state.
