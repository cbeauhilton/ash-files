    "abstract_text": "Background : Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) has a key role in B-cell receptor mediated pathways that are implicated in the pathogenesis of several B-cell malignancies. Inhibition of BTK has been shown to block several B-cell functions, including proliferation, antigen presentation, antibody production and cell migration. Small molecule BTK-inhibitors (BTKi) have been approved for the treatment of several B-cell malignancies, including resistant/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia (WM). M7583 is a potent and highly selective BTKi, which is currently being investigated in a two-part, phase I/II trial (NCT02825836) in patients with refractory/resistant B cell malignancies. Methods : In the dose-escalation part of the study (Part 1), patients with refractory/resistant B cell malignancies received once-daily (QD) M7583 in 28-day cycles in ascending dose cohorts following an adaptive Bayesian design; the starting dose was 80 mg for 3 days followed by 160 mg (80/160 mg QD). The dose-expansion part of the study (Part 2) will investigate M7583 in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL; activated B-cell subtype) or MCL who have failed 1-3 lines of previous therapy. Here, we present safety and tumor response outcomes as assessed by the investigators according to Cheson/CLL/Owen criteria for patients in Part 1. Results : In total, 25 patients were screened for inclusion in Part 1, as of 20 th May 2018 18 had received treatment with M7583 in 5 dose cohorts (80/160 mg, n=3; 300 mg QD, n=3; 600 mg QD, n=5; 300 mg BID, n=3; 900 mg QD, n=4). Treatment is ongoing in 11 patients. Patients were mostly male (72%, n=13), aged 43-80 years (median 63 years) and had a diagnosis of MCL (n=8), WM (n=4), DLBCL (n=3), marginal zone lymphoma (n=2), or small lymphocytic lymphoma (n=1). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 89% (n=16/18) of patients; the most common TEAE was diarrhea (n=6/18; 33%). No dose-limiting toxicities were reported. Grade \u22653 TEAEs occurred in 10 patients (56%), events in 3 (17%) were considered related to treatment. Six patients (33%) had serious TEAEs and 2 patients (11%) had treatment-related serious TEAEs. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Patients received M7583 for up to 20 months (median 7.9 [range 0.5-20] months). Preliminary study data show the objective response rate was 50% (9 of 18 subjects). Disease control was observed in 14 of 18 subjects (disease control rate 78%): 2 subjects had a complete response (CR), 7 subjects had a partial response (PR), 1 subjects had a minor response (MR) and 4 subjects had stable disease (SD). Responses were observed across all doses: 80/160 mg QD, 1 PR, 2 SD; 300 mg QD, 2 PR, 1 MR; 600 mg QD, 1 CR, 2 PR; 300 mg BID, 2 PR, 1 SD; 900 mg QD, 1 CR, 1 SD. Both the 300 mg BID and 900 mg QD doses met the criteria for the optimal biological dose, therefore, these doses represent potential recommended phase 2 doses in support of further development. Conclusions: Clinical benefit was observed with M7583 across the doses investigated and was well tolerated in patients with refractory/resistant B cell malignancies. These outcomes indicate a favorable benefit:risk profile for M7583.
