    "abstract_text": "From 06/1982 to 12/2003, 281 patients (163 male) received autologous (AuSCt) and/or allogeneic (AlloSCT) transplantations as part of first line treatment (61%) second line treatment(21%) or salvage therapy (17%). There were 140 multiple myelomas (including 3 amyloidosis), 62 lymphomas, 51 acute myeloid leukemias, 24 solid tumors and 4 chronic myeloid leukemias.Two hundred and sixty nine patients-median age: 64 y(60\u201377) - received Au SCT (28/261 received a second Au SCT in med of 2\u20137 months), 1patient (71 y) received a double syngeneic transplant,12 patients -median age: 62(60\u201368) received AlloSCT. Conditionning regimen (Cond reg) for the first Au SCT included Melphalan 140 mg/m\u00b2 n=168; BEAM n=41; Melphalan 200mg/m\u00b2 n=29; Mel Busulfan (8 to 16 mg/kg) or Mel TBI 8 grays n=18; Cytoxan 200mg/kg Melphalan1 40 n=9: TBI 8 Grays n=7; BCNU 600mg/m\u00b2 n=3. Cond reg for the second Au SCT included Mel 200 n=20; Mel 140 n=4; BCU 600 n=4. Cond reg for the double syngeneic transplant were Mel 140 and Bu 8 Mel 140.Cond reg for the AlloSCT were Fludarabin/Busulfan/ATG (FBS) based reduced intensity regimen (RIC) in 11 cases. Ninety percent of the patients received peripheral blood stem cells-med 5,3.10*6CD34/kg (2\u201340)- 10% of the patients transplanted before 1994 received bone marrow cells. Tolerance was good with only 9/281 transplant related deaths: 5 sepsis/MOF in aplasia (D11\u2013D21) 2 ARDS (D30\u2013D80) 1 AGVH (D 60) 1 CGVH (3 years). Theses deaths occured in 4 ref MM( 2 renal instability,1 cardiac amyloidosis), 2 CR2 NHL, 1 OR1 MM, 1 stable MDS after FBS in 2 pts, BEAM in 2 pts, Mel 140 in 4 pts, Mel 200 (second transplant) in 1 pt. With a median follow up of 20 months from transplant,7/281 second cancers had occured: 1AML, 1ALL, 2 NSC pulmonary carcinoma, 1 colon cancer, 1uterin carcinoma, 1 melanoma; 2 of these 7 patients had died. One hundred and fifty eight patients had relapsed in a median of 11 months (1\u201392). Median survival for the 281 patients is 37 months without diference between pts older or younger than 65. Median survival for MM, NHL/HL, AML or ST are 40 months, 45 months, 18 months and 23 months respectively",
