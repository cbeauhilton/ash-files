    "abstract_text": "Rac2 is a hematopoietic-specific Rho-GTPase implicated as an important constituent of the NADPH oxidase complex. We previously showed that Rac2 plays a stimulus-specific role in regulating NADPH oxidase activation and other functional responses in neutrophils [Kim and Dinauer, JI 166, 2001]. Here we investigate the effect of arachidonic acid (AA) on Rac2-regulated NADPH oxidase activity. Superoxide production in rac2-/- neutrophils was significantly lower (~4-fold) than that of wild-type when stimulated with PMA or AA alone. However, exogenously added AA (10 \u03bcM) fully restored the defect in PMA-elicited NADPH oxidase activity in rac2 \u2212 / \u2212 neutrophils, while having no effect on FMLP-elicited superoxide production. Impaired PMA- or AA-induced F-actin polymerization in rac2 \u2212 / \u2212 neutrophils was also not restored by co-stimulation with PMA and AA. Taken together, these observations suggest that there are agonist- and pathway-specific differences in the underlying basis of functional defects in rac2 \u2212 / \u2212 neutrophils. To further investigate possible mechanisms of AA-mediated rescue of PMA-stimulated NADPH oxidase activation in rac2 \u2212 / \u2212 neutrophils, we measured protein expression and activity of cytosolic phospholipase A 2 (cPLA 2 ) and protein kinase C (PKC). The expression of cPLA 2 and PMA-stimulated release of AA was similar between wild-type and rac2 \u2212 / \u2212 neutrophils, suggesting that defects in AA production by PMA-stimulated rac2 \u2212 / \u2212 neutrophils do not account for the effect of exogenous AA on oxidase activity. The neutrophil expression of PKC isoforms (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4, \u03b6) was also similar between genotypes. The cytosolic p47 phox and p67 phox components of NADPH oxidase were translocated to the plasma membrane upon stimulation with PMA in both genotypes, and no additional translocation in either wild-type or rac2 \u2212 / \u2212 neutrophils was detected upon co-stimulation with AA. The level of activated Rac1-GTP was similar between genotypes following stimulation, and was not increased by co-stimulation with PMA and AA. These studies indicate that the addition of exogenous AA reconstitutes PMA-elicited superoxide production in rac2 \u2212 / \u2212 neutrophils independent of the effects on translocation of p47 phox and p67 phox and activation of Rac1 GTPase. We hypothesize that the effect of AA is exerted through conformational changes of the assembled NADPH oxidase.",
