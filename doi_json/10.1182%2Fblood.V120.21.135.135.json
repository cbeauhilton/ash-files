    "abstract_text": "Abstract 135 From December 2000 to June 2010, 1201 children with SR-BCP-ALL (age: 1\u20139 years, WBC<50 G/L, CNS-, no MLL rearrangement, no BCR-ABL , no Down syndrome) were included in the FRALLE 2000-A multicenter protocol. At a MFU of 60 months, 1195 patients are evaluable. An ETV6-RUNX1 fusion transcript was documented in 28% of the pts (329 out of 1173 evaluable pts). Induction regimen: prednisone prephase +IT MTX, dexamethasone (DEX) 6 mg/m 2 /d, vincristine (VCR), native E.coli L-asparaginase ASPA: 6000 IU/m 2 \u00d7 9 infusions). Response was assessed at D8 (blood, good if < 1000 blasts/mm 3 ), D21 (bone marrow morphology, good if less than 5% blasts, so-called M1) and end of induction D35 (bone marrow morphology and DNA-based PCR for Ig/TCR rearrangements MRD). A D21 M1 marrow was observed in 1132 pts (94.7%). Out of these, 1128 pts were randomized to receive daunorubicin (DNR; 40 mg/m 2 at D22 and D29) [560 DNR(+) pts] or not [568 DNR(-) pts]. Pts with D21 M2/M3 marrow (n= 61; 5%) were not randomized and received two infusions of DNR. Two pts died before D21. Pts with D21 M1 marrow (A1 group) received after induction a 12 week-consolidation based on VCR, DEX, mercaptopurine (6-MP) and oral methotrexate (MTX), followed by a 1 st delayed intensification (reduced \u201cProtocol II\u201d, including a total of 75 mg/m 2 of doxorubicin), an interphase therapy (VCR, DEX, 6-MP, MTX), and a triple drug only-2 nd delayed intensification (DI\u00b02) (VCR, MTX 100 mg/m2, ASPA 20000 IU/m 2 ; 4 cycles). A 24-month maintenance was then applied, including 12 VCR-DEX pulses the first year. A total of 18 intrathecal injections of MTX was given. Only the rare patients with D21 M3 marrow and/or EOI MRD level \u22651% (n= 47, 4%)(A3 group) received an intensified treatment after CR with 3 block-consolidation, intensified interphase with 6 cycles of MTX 5 g/m 2 and a second DI (\u201creduced protocol II\u201d). No pt received CNS irradiation. Results: 1. Overall efficacy: No leukemic induction failure was observed; 4 induction deaths (0.3%) occurred leading to a 99.7% CR rate. Only 30 out 1097 evaluable pts (2.7%) had a decisional EOI MRD \u2265 1%. Eighty-two relapses have been observed (BM: 47, CNS+: 24, BM+CNS: 9, testis: 2). For the whole population 5-year EFS is 91.5% (95%CI: 89.8\u201393.3), 5-year OS is 97.4% (95%CI: 96.4\u201398.4). 5-yr EFS and OS for the A1 and A3 groups are 93.1% vs. 61.2% (p<0.0001), and 98.3% vs. 84.2% respectively (p<0.0001). Five-year DFS of the 30 pts with MRD \u22651% is 58.8% (95%CI: 41.7\u201382.8). Five-year EFS of the children with ETV6-RUNX1 fusion transcript is 96.6% (95%CI: 94.4\u201398.8). 2. Overall toxicity: 5 non leukemic deaths have been observed after CR (0.4%). Other main toxicities were attributable to ASPA (CNS thrombosis: 1.5%, grade 3\u20134 pancreatitis: 0.8%, allergic reaction-all grades- during DI \u00b02: 70%). Six cases of secondary neoplasms were observed (AML: 5 pts, astrocytoma: 1 pt). 3. Randomization: 5y EFS and OS from randomization was 92.9% and 97.2% for D21 M1 pts DNR(+) versus 93.3% and 98.2% for D21 M1 DNR(-) pts (p= 0.89 and p= 0.85, respectively). Interestingly EOI MRD levels in the two arms were not different at the sensitivity cut-off of 10 \u22122 (p=0.93) or 10 \u22123 (p= 0.74). 4. Prognostic factors: For the whole population, age < 6 years, WBC < 20.000/mm 3 , ETV6-RUNX1 positivity, as well as D21 marrow M1 and EOI MRD levels of 10 \u22122 and 10 \u22123 were all associated to EFS in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis remain only WBC < 20.000/mm 3 (p=.001), ETV6-RUNX1 positivity (p=.02), EOI MRD levels \u2264 10 \u22123 (p=1.4\u00d710 \u22125 ). Considering only randomized pts (D21M1 pts) age <6 (p=.004), WBC < 20.000/mm 3 (p=.04), ETV6-RUNX1 positivity (p=.01), EOI MRD levels \u2264 10 \u22123 (p=.002) remain as independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Very good results were obtained with this VCR-DEX-ASPA oriented protocol. SR-BCP ALL pts which represents around 55 % of all children with ALL can be cured with a modest dose of anthracyclin (75 mg/m 2 ). A further decrease in therapy based on the identified prognostic factors could be proposed. Intensification of the chemotherapy for the rare SR pts with a very high MRD has salvaged half of these pts but the addition of new drugs and/or HSCT is now to be evaluated.
