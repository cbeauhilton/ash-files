    "abstract_text": "Inheritance of a naturally occurring polymorphism of the human integrin \u03b23-subunit at amino acid 33 causes a change from Leu to Pro that has been implicated as a risk factor for thrombotic complication in humans. It is unclear; however, if Pro (also known as the platelet alloantigen Pl A2 form of \u03b23) can alter integrin activation to significantly affect platelet function in vivo, since some clinical studies do not corroborate the initial findings. Since Pl A2 is a frequent variant of \u03b23 expressed on 28% of platelets from Americans the impact of this genetic variation on platelet function could have widespread clinical relevance; therefore, we developed a murine model to determine if expression of this common polymorphism of human integrin \u03b23 can increase platelet function and lead to an increased propensity for thrombosis within a homogeneous population of mice. This model eliminates issues arising from variation in the genetic make-up, physical environment, and/or lifestyles of humans and allows for in vivo analysis not possible with human subjects. To accomplish this, cDNA encoding each form of the human \u03b23-subunit was subcloned into an HIV type-1 lentivirus-derived vector under the transcriptional control of the human \u03b1IIb gene promoter to direct synthesis of \u03b23 specifically to the megakaryocyte lineage. Bone marrow was isolated from \u03b23-deficient mice and transduced with \u03b23 virions encoding either the Pl A1 or Pl A2 form of human \u03b23, and then transplanted into lethally irradiated \u03b23-deficient littermates. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated stable expression of the hybrid murine/human \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin complex on the surface of circulating platelets. Immunoanalysis using monoclonal antibodies and human serum that react specifically with the Pl A1 or Pl A2 confirmed the identity of each alloantigen of human \u03b23. The lentivirus contained a second transgene encoding a drug-selectable marker (P140K MGMT) that was used for in vivo enrichment of transduced cells in mice treated with two regimens of cytotoxic reagents, O 6 -BG/BCNU. Flow cytometric analysis showed that use of drug-selection resulted in increased expression of the integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 complex to equal levels on nearly 100% of platelets using either form of human \u03b23. Similar to platelets from normal mice, platelets expressing each Pl A form of \u03b23 could be induced to form aggregates ex vivo upon treatment with a cocktail of physiological agonists of platelet activation (adenosine diphosphate, epinephrine and the thrombin receptor activating peptide). These results demonstrate the feasibility for targeting expression of altered forms of the human integrin \u03b23-subunit to murine platelets and pave the way for future studies to examine and compare the effect of integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 structure on platelet function and thrombosis in vivo .",
