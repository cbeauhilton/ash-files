    "abstract_text": "Introduction Patients (pts) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with poor-risk cytogenetics at diagnosis have inadequate responses to standard treatment. Pre-clinical and clinical data show that TP53 mutation (mut) is associated with poor outcomes with venetoclax (Ven). However, the clinical impact of AML with poor-risk cytogenetics with and without a TP53 mut treated with a hypomethylating agent (HMA) and Ven is unknown. Herein, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the Ven + azacitidine (Aza) or HMA combination in pts with treatment-na\u00efve AML with poor-risk cytogenetics with TP53 wt or TP53 mut . Methods Treatment-na\u00efve pts with AML unfit for intensive chemotherapy either due to age \u226575 years or co-morbidities were enrolled. Data were pooled from an ongoing phase 3 study (NCT02993523) comparing pts treated with Ven+Aza or placebo (Pbo)+Aza, and a phase 1b study (NCT02203773), in which pts were treated with Ven and an HMA, either Aza or decitabine (Dec). Ven 400 mg daily, Aza 75 mg/m 2 (days 1-7), or Dec 20 mg/m 2 (days 1-5), were administered over 28-day cycles. Cytogenetic risk was determined locally pre-treatment per NCCN (2016) criteria with the following abnormalities associated with poor outcomes: complex (\u22653 clonal chromosomal abnormalities), monosomal karyotype, -5,5q, -7,7q, 11q23-non t(9;11) inv(3), t(3;3), t(6;9), and t(9;22). TP53 mut status was assessed from pre-treatment BM aspirates at screening and analyzed centrally using MyAML panel assays (covering all coding and non-coding exons, limit of detection 1%; Invivoscribe). Pts without a result either due to an inconclusive test or missing specimen were excluded from the analysis. Response assessments were performed per modified International Working Group response criteria for AML. Results The pooled analysis included 546 pts; 353 and 145 pts in the Ven+Aza and Aza groups, respectively, with poor-risk cytogenetics observed in 127 (36%; TP53 wt , 50; TP53 mut , 54) and 56 (39%; TP53 wt , 22; TP53 mut , 18) pts. There were 401 pts in the Ven+HMA group with poor-risk cytogenetics observed in 152 (38%, TP53 wt , 61; TP53 mut , 68). The median variant allele frequency for TP53 was 42.9% (range 6.5 \u2500 93.4) for Ven+Aza and 42.9% (3.5 \u2500 93.7) for Aza. Key pt demographics are shown in the Table . In pts with poor-risk cytogenetics + TP53 wt who received Ven+Aza vs. Aza, the composite remission rates (CRc: complete remission [CR] + CR with incomplete hematologic remission [CRi]) were 70% vs. 23%, median duration of remission (DoR) was 18.37 (95% CI 9.63 \u2500 not evaluable [NE]) vs. 8.51 (1.05 \u2500 NE) months (mos), and median overall survival (OS) was 23.43 (95% CI 11.93 \u2500 NE) vs. 11.29 (4.90 \u2500 12.78) mos ( Figure A ). Similar results were observed in pts treated with Ven+HMA: CRc rate was 74%, median DoR 16.72 (95% CI 8.08 \u2500 20.99) mos, and median OS was 21.13 (95% CI 11.93 \u2500 29.01) mos ( Figure B ).These poor-risk cytogenetics + TP53 wt results were comparable to those of pts with intermediate-risk cytogenetics + TP53 wt (Ven+Aza [n=166]: CRc 72%, DoR 21.91 mos, OS 19.15 mos; Ven+HMA [n=187]: CRc 72%, DoR 21.19 mos, OS 19.81 mos). In pts with poor-risk cytogenetics + TP53 mut who received Ven+Aza or Aza, CRc rates were 41% vs. 17%, median DoR was 6.54 (95% CI 2.79 \u2500 10.61) vs. 6.7 (6.7 \u2500 NE) mos, and median OS was 5.17 (95% CI 2.17 \u2500 6.83) vs. 4.9 (2.14 \u2500 9.3) mos. In pts treated with Ven+HMA, the CRc rate was 47%, median DoR was 6.54 (95% CI 3.58 \u2500 12.09) mos, and median OS was 5.42 (95% CI 3.71 \u2500 7.39) mos. In pts with poor-risk cytogenetics + TP53 wt , the common \u2265 grade 3 (G3) adverse events (AEs) on Ven+Aza or Aza were thrombocytopenia (36%/36%), febrile neutropenia (32%/14%), anemia (26%/6%), neutropenia (24%/27%), and pneumonia (18%/23%). In pts with poor-risk cytogenetics + TP53 mut, the common \u2265G3 AEs on Ven+Aza or Aza were also febrile neutropenia (43%/22%), thrombocytopenia (28%/28%), neutropenia (26%/17%), anemia (13%/32%), and pneumonia (26%/33%). In pts treated with Ven+HMA, the most common \u2265G3 AEs in pts with poor-risk cytogenetics + TP53 wt or TP53 mut were similar. Conclusion Among pts with poor-risk cytogenetics + TP53 wt , treatment with Ven+Aza or Ven+HMA was associated with higher remission rates and prolonged DoR and OS compared to pts treated with Aza alone. Outcomes were similar to intermediate-risk TP53 wt Ven+Aza pts. In contrast, for similarly treated pts with poor-risk cytogenetics + TP53 mut , improved response rates did not translate into improved DoR or OS.No new toxicities were noted.
