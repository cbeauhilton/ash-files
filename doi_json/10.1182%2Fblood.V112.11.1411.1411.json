    "abstract_text": "The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-2 has been implicated in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cells. Herein we explored the role of GATA-2 as a candidate regulator of the hematopoietic progenitor cell compartment. We showed that bone marrow from GATA-2 heterozygote ( GATA-2+/- ) mice displayed attenuated granulocyte-macrophage progenitor function in colony-forming cell (CFC) and serial replating CFC assays. This defect was mapped to the Lin \u2212 CD117 + Sca-1 \u2212 CD34 + CD16/32 high granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) compartment of GATA-2+/ \u2212 marrow, which was reduced in size and functionally impaired in CFC assays and competitive transplantation. Similar functional impairments were obtained using a RNA interference approach to stably knockdown GATA-2 in wild-type GMP. While apoptosis and cell cycle distribution remained unperturbed in GATA-2+/ \u2212 GMP, quiescent cells from GATA-2+/ \u2212 GMP exhibited altered functionality. Gene expression analysis revealed attenuated expression of HES-1 mRNA in GATA-2 deficient GMPs. Binding of GATA-2 to the HES-1 locus was detected in the myeloid progenitor cell line 32Dcl3 and enforced expression of HES-1 expression in GATA-2+/ \u2212 GMP rectified the functional defect, suggesting that GATA-2 regulates myeloid progenitor function through HES-1. These data collectively point to GATA-2 as novel, pivotal determinant of GMP cell fate."
