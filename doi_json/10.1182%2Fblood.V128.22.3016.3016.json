    "abstract_text": "Background: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an incurable subtype of B-cell lymphoma. Ibrutinib, a first-in-class, once-daily, oral covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of MCL in patients previously treated. In our prior multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial, the overall response rate in relapsed/refractory MCL was 68%, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 13.9 months. However, the majority of MCL patients treated with ibrutinib relapsed; in these relapsed patients, the one-year survival rate was only 22%. Therefore, there exists an urgent need for additional novel targeted therapies to improve the mortality rate in these patients. In this study, we assessed the in vitro and in vivo effects of duvelisib, a PI3K-\u03b4,-\u03b3 inhibitor, in MCL. Methods: The PI3K/AKT/mTOR and other cell survival signaling pathways were investigated by RNASeq and reverse phase protein array (RPPA) in ibrutinib-sensitive and -resistant MCL samples. The expression of PI3K isoforms, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 was tested in 11 MCL cell lines, patient and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) MCL cells by western blot analysis. We then investigated the growth inhibition and apoptosis of duvelisib (IPI-145, Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) in MCL cells by CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) and Annexin V-binding assay (BD Biosciences). We established a primary MCL-bearing PDX model and passaged the primary MCL tumor to next generations. Mice were administrated with 50 mg/kg duvelisib daily by oral gavage. Tumor burden and survival time were investigated in the MCL-PDX model. Results: We found that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was activated in both primary and acquired ibrutinib-resistant MCL cell lines and PDX MCL cells. We immunoblotted PI3K isoforms, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 in 11 MCL cell lines and the result demonstrated that both ibrutinib-sensitive and ibrutinib-resistant MCL cells dominantly expressed PI3K-\u03b4 and -\u03b3. Next, we tested the effects of duvelisib on these MCL cells. Duvelisib had effects on the growth inhibition and apoptosis in both ibrutinib-sensitive and ibrutinib-resistant MCL cells as good as the PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor, idelalisib (Cal-101, GS-1101). The PI3K-\u03b4 isoform could play a very important role in PI3K-mediated signals in MCL. We then investigated the effects of duvelisib in vivo through our established MCL-bearing PDX mouse models. These models are created by inoculating the primary tumor cells from MCL patients into a human fetal bone chip implanted into NSG mice to provide a microenvironment that reconstitutes the human environment. MCL tumor mass was then passaged to next generations for therapeutic investigation of duvelisib. Mice were treated with 50 mg/kg duvelisib daily by oral gavage. Our data demonstrated that duvelisib significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival of MCL-PDX mice. Conclusion: Duvelisib, an oral dual inhibitor of PI3K-\u03b4,-\u03b3, inhibits MCL growth both in vitro and in PDX mice. These preclinical results suggests duvelisib may be effective in the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory MCL. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
