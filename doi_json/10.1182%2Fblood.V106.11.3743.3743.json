    "abstract_text": "Objectives To investigate incidence rate and the etiological factors of anemia in general hospital. Methods We selected 912 patients with anemia from 4198 inpatients in our hospital from Jan.to Feb.2004,and analyzed their clinical data retrospectively. All inpatients had been detected Hb,RBC,MCV and MCHC. We collected 2ml venous blood in anticoagulant EDTA-k2 tube and measured them with Gen.STM System2 blood cell radiomete in 2 hours. some patients had been punctured bone marrow examination. According to diagnostic standard of anemia(male adult Hb100fl). Results The incidence of anemia in inpatients in general hospital was 21.72%. 96.71% of patients were mild-moderate degree anemia and only 13.71% anemia patients showed symptom of anemia such as dizzying,drumming. But only 1.10% of patients had been diagnosed by doctors. 6.36% of patients were caused by hematologic disease and 89.74% of patients coexisted primary disease.53.62% of patient were secondary to chronic disease such as tumor,chronic infection, rheumatic disease. 27.85% of patients were secondary to blood loss. Then 8.00% of patients was caused by chronic systemic disease. Conclusions Anemia existed in various clinical diseases. Misdiagnosis rate of anemia was high. Appropriate treatment of secondary anemia was beneficial for prognosis of primary diseases. All doctors should pay more attention to anemia in general hospital.",
