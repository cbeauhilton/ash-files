    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1476 Poster Board I-499 Background: Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is increasingly used as an alternative source of transplantable CD34 + haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) for neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. In addition to CD34-expressing HSC, human UCB contains a rare population of CD34 \u2212 lineage \u2212 cells endowed with the ability to differentiate along the T/NK pathway in response to interleukin (IL)-15 and in the presence of a stromal cell support. IL-21 is a four-helix bundle cytokine released by activated CD4 + T cells and by NKT cells. IL-21 is a crucial regulator of NK cell function, whose influence on IL-15-induced differentiation of CD34 \u2212 lineage \u2212 cells has not been investigated previously. The present study was designed and conducted to address whether IL-21 might replace the stromal cell requirements and foster the IL-15-induced NK differentiation of human UCB CD34 \u2212 lineage \u2212 cells. Methods: CD34 \u2212 lineage \u2212 cells were maintained in liquid culture with 10 \u22126 M hydrocortisone, 20 ng/ml Flt3-L and 20 ng/ml SCF, with the addition of 50 ng/ml IL-15 and 20 ng/ml IL-21, either alone or in combination. Cultures were established in the absence of feeder cells or serum supplementation. Cytokine-treated cells were used to evaluate the following parameters: a) cell surface phenotype; b) expression of molecular determinants of lymphoid/NK cell differentiation; c) secretion of IFN-\u03b3, GM-CSF, TNF-\u03b1 and CCL3/MIP-1\u03b1; d) cytolytic activity against NK-sensitive tumour cell targets and e) relative amount of Stat1 (Tyr701), Stat3 (Tyr705) and Stat5 (Tyr694) phosphorylation in response to IL-21. For all the above detailed experiments, control cultures were established with UCB-derived CD34 + HSC. Results: Freshly isolated CD34 \u2212 lineage \u2212 cells stained negatively for stem cell-associated (CD34, CD133) and NK/lymphoid surface antigens (CD7, CD56, CD16, CD3, TCR\u03b1\u03b2), and comprised 0.22% on average of UCB mononuclear cells (samples analyzed = 8). CD34 \u2212 lineage \u2212 cells proliferated vigorously in response to IL-15 and IL-21 (average fold expansion at week +4 of culture = 42.5) but not to IL-21 alone, and up-regulated phosphorylated Stat1 and Stat3 proteins, in good agreement with previously published reports on the IL-21-induced activation of Stat signaling. CD34 \u2212 lineage \u2212 cells expanded by IL-21 in combination with IL-15 acquired a peculiar lymphoid morphology with heavy cytoplasmic granules. When compared with CD34-derived NK cells, CD34 \u2212 lineage \u2212 cells emerging from IL-15+IL-21-containing cultures expressed very low levels of CD16 and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR), but high levels of CD56, NKG2D and IL-21 receptor, consistent with pseudo-mature NK cells. IL-21/IL-15-differentiated cells up-regulated mRNA signals for Bcl-2, GATA-3 and Id2, a master switch required for NK-cell development, and harboured un-rearranged TCR\u03b3 genes, suggesting that NK commitment under the experimental conditions here established occurs through a pathway that does not include TCR rearrangement. From a functional standpoint, IL-21/IL-15-treated cells secreted copious amounts of IFN-\u03b3, GM-CSF and CCL3/MIP-1\u03b1, and expressed cell surface CD107a upon contact with NK-sensitive tumour targets, a measure of exocytosis of NK secretory granules. Specifically, an average 65\u00b111% of CD56 + NK cells differentiated with IL-15+IL-21 stained positively for CD107a in co-cultures established with NK-sensitive K562 cells. NK cell degranulation occurred at significantly lower levels in co-cultures containing K562 cells and IL-15-differentiated CD34 \u2212 lineage \u2212 cells (mean percentage of CD107a + CD56 + NK cells equal to 35\u00b16 at E:T ratio = 1; p < 0.01 compared with cultures containing IL-15+IL-21-matured NK cells), suggesting that IL-15 and IL-21 exerted synergistic effects on NK activity. Finally, NK cells differentiated from CD34 + HSC with either IL-15 alone or IL-15+IL-21 manifested a similar cytotoxic activity to that of cytokine-differentiated CD34 \u2212 lineage \u2212 cells. Conclusions: This study suggests that considerable numbers of highly pure, lytic CD56 + CD16 \u2212/+ NK cells for adoptive immunotherapy can be obtained from UCB CD34 \u2212 lineage \u2212 cells using a serum-free, feeder cell-free culture system. The findings highlighted herein also shed some light into the developmental intermediates of NK cells that can be differentiated after the exposure of CD34 \u2212 lineage \u2212 cells to IL-21.
