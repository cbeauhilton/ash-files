    "abstract_text": "More than 90% of under one year old infants with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) have chromosome translocation t(1;22)(p13;q13) with RBM15 fused to MKL1. RBM15 encodes an RNA binding protein important for hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. In agreement with its roles in AMKL, RBM15 is required for normal megakaryocyte differentiation. We found that higher expression of PRMT1 (Protein Arginine Methyltransferase) is commonly seen in M7 leukemia patient samples than other types of myeloid leukemia and that RBM15 is a bona fide methylation target for PRMT1. Using mass spectrometry analysis, we mapped the PRMT1 mediated mono-methylated site. The enzymatic activity of the PRMT1 V2 isoform is required for RBM15 degradation, as both shRNA molecules knocking down PRMT1 and small chemical PRMT1 inhibitors stabilize the RBM15 protein. Mutation of the methylation site to lysine blocks the ubiquitylation mediated degradation. Thus the degradation is a methylation dependent process. We identified the E3 ligase responsible for the degradation. Down-regulation of the RBM15 protein changes the isoform ratio of genes including GATA1 critical megakaryocyte differentiation. We found that RBM15 regulates its interaction with SF3B1A in methylation dependent manner during alternative splicing of GATA1 pre-mRNA. Thus, via methylation triggered RBM15 degradation, the megakaryocyte progenitor cells maintain a delicate balance between differentiation and proliferation by keeping the proper ratio of GATA1s and GATA1-full length mRNA. SF3B1A has been shown to be mutated in myeloid dysplasia syndrome and in several different types of leukemia. Methylation by PRMT1 links the two types of leukemic genes into a single pathway. Our results imply that targeting PRMT1/RBM15 pathway might be a potential therapy for AMKL and other blood malignancies. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
