    "abstract_text": "Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) inhibits FXa and produces FXa-dependent feedback inhibition of FVIIa/TF activity. TFPI is expressed as isoforms \u03b1 and \u03b2 in man, and \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 in the mouse. TFPI\u03b1 consists of an acidic N-terminal peptide followed by three Kunitz-type protease inhibitory domains (K1K2K3) and a basic C-terminal peptide (CTP). TFPI\u03b2 lacks the K3 and CTP of TFPI\u03b1 and instead contains a sequence that directs the attachment of a GPI membrane anchor to TFPI\u03b2. Murine TFPI\u03b3 encodes a two-Kunitz domain TFPI with a short, unique C-terminal region. TFPI in murine plasma circulates at ~20 times the level in man and is not detectably affected by heparin treatment: ~31.5 + 3.7 nM before and 29.7 + 4.1 nM (n=10) 15 min after 2 units of heparin (IP). The major form of murine plasma TFPI migrates on SDS-PAGE as a ~41,000 MW protein but elutes from size-exclusion column chromatography with at an apparent MW of ~300,000. It binds to Cab-O-Sil and floats at 1.25 g/mL KBr consistent with an association with lipoproteins like the TFPI in human plasma. Mass spectroscopy (MS) analysis identifies this major form as a two-Kunitz domain form lacking detectible C-terminal isoform-specific sequences. In contrast, MS analysis of total TFPI isolated from murine plasma, detects both TFPI\u03b1-specific and TFPI\u03b3-specific peptides, but no TFPI\u03b2-specific peptides. This is the first identification of TFPI \u03b3 protein. MS analysis of human lipoprotein-associated TFPI was also found to be a two-Kunitz domain form lacking isoform-specific sequences. Analysis of total TFPI from human plasma detected TFPI\u03b1-specific, but no TFPI\u03b2- and no TFPI\u03b3-specific sequences. Sequences homologous with the mouse \u03b3 exon are present within the TFPI gene of many species. mRNA amplified by RT-PCR from a variety of human tissues contained the TFPI\u03b3 homologous sequence, but in each case it was part of TFPI\u03b2 3'-untranslated message. The 3' splice acceptor sequence for the TFPI \u03b3 exon in mouse, rat, Chinese hamster and squirrel is CAG, which is commonly used for splicing (71%), and rat ESTs encoding TFPI\u03b3 have been reported. The corresponding sequence in man and other primates, GAG, is rarely utilized (<1%) for splicing. TFPI \u03b1 exon-deleted, \u03b2 exon-deleted, \u03b2/\u03b3 exons-deleted and \u03b3 exon-disrupted mouse strains were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The KO mice, born at expected ratios, appear healthy. Using quantitative RT-PCR, validated with isoform-deleted mice, relative amounts of TFPI \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 mRNA in WT murine lung are 30%, 20%, and 50%, respectively. Plasma TFPI levels in TFPI\u03b1(-/-) and TFPI\u03b2(-/-) mice are similar to WT mice (~100%). They are ~50% in TFPI\u03b3(+/-) and TFPI\u03b2/\u03b3(+/-) mice and <2% in TFPI\u03b3(-/-) and TFPI\u03b2/\u03b3(-/-) mice. Thus, the major form of murine plasma TFPI is derived form TFPI \u03b3 . Four samples of platelets isolated from 5-10 mice, revealed the blood level of TFPI in murine platelets (at 7.5 x 10 8 /mL) was 74.6 + 16.0 pM. Present at WT levels in TFPI\u03b2/\u03b3 KO mice, platelet TFPI is absent in TFPI\u03b1 KO mice, confirming that in mice, like humans, platelet TFPI is TFPI\u03b1. Studies of mice with combined TFPI\u03b2/\u03b3(-/-) gene deletion (expressing \u03b1 only) show a plasma level of TFPI\u03b1 of 66.8 + 12.9 pM that increases 7.3 + 2.5-fold after heparin treatment. Our baseline TFPI\u03b1 measurement represents a total value and the distribution of TFPI\u03b1 derived \"free\" and lipoprotein-associated forms remains to be determined. The heparin-releasable TFPI\u03b1 is likely endothelial-derived but this remains to be determined. Wild type mice presumably also release TFPI\u03b1with heparin treatment but, in our experience, this response is masked due to the high circulating level of TFPI\u03b3. Our results for TFPI in the m ouse differ from, and add to, previous reports in important respects: 1. The majority of TFPI circulating at high levels in mouse plasma is derived from TFPI\u03b3, not \u03b1 or \u03b2. 2. Sequences homologous to the mouse TFPI\u03b3 exon are present in many species, but the 3' acceptor splice site sequence in man and other primates is unfavorable for splicing. 3. Relative levels of TFPI \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 mRNA in mouse lung are 30%, 20%, and 50%, respectively. 4. Like in man, TFPI\u03b1 circulates at a low level in mouse plasma, which increases several-fold following heparin treatment. 5. A two-Kunitz domain form of TFPI, lacking isoform-specific C-terminal sequences, is bound to plasma lipoproteins in both mouse and man. 6. Studies in TFPI\u03b3 deleted mice (expressing only \u03b1 and \u03b2) should provide results most relevant to humans. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
