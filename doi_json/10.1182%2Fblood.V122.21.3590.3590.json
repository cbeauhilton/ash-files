    "abstract_text": "Introduction Prophylactic regimens with coagulation factor in patients with hemophilia A have been designed to maintain FVIII activity above 1 IU/dL, based on previous studies demonstrating that joints can be preserved and bleeding is minimized when circulating factor levels remain above this level (Nilsson IM, et al. J Intern Med 1992). Collins and colleagues confirmed this observation and demonstrated that increasing time spent under 1 IU/dL FVIII activity in patients on prophylaxis with recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) was associated with an increase in bleeding episodes and hemarthroses (Collins PW, et al. J Thromb Haemost 2009). The pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and efficacy of rFVIII Fc fusion protein (rFVIIIFc) have been evaluated in the A-LONG study and recently reported (Mahlangu J, et al. J Thromb Haemost 2013). Briefly, previously treated male patients, \u226512 years old with severe hemophilia A, were enrolled in A-LONG and allocated to 1 of 3 treatment arms: Arm 1) individualized prophylaxis with dose and dosing interval adjustments (25\u201365 IU/kg every 3\u20135 days) based on PK and clinical indications, Arm 2, fixed dose (65 IU/kg) weekly prophylaxis, and Arm 3, episodic treatment (10\u201350 IU/kg) for bleeding episodes. The median annualized bleeding rates for individualized prophylaxis and weekly prophylaxis were 1.6 and 3.6, respectively, and 33.6 for episodic treatment. In this analysis, we evaluated the bleeding tendency in relation to predicted FVIII activity levels in 163 subjects in the A-LONG study. Methods A 2-compartment population PK model of rFVIIIFc was developed based on activity-time profiles in 180 severe hemophilia A subjects aged 12 \u2013 65 years old (16 from a Phase 1/2a study and 164 from A-LONG collected over \u2264 52 weeks of treatment) (Neelakantan S, et al. J Thromb Haemost 2013). Individual post-hoc PK parameters were derived to construct continuous FVIII activity-time profiles for each dose administered over the course of the study for 163 subjects in A-LONG. The cumulative time under 1IU/dL FVIII levels for each individual on study was calculated and normalized to obtain annualized time under 1IU/dL. Negative binomial regression models were used to evaluate associations between the number of bleeding episodes (overall, spontaneous, traumatic, and joint) and annualized time (days) under 1IU/dL FVIII activity. Models were adjusted for age, body mass index, baseline HIV and HCV status, baseline von Willebrand factor, number of bleeding episodes in the 12 months prior to study entry, and each subject\u2019s time on study. Results The predicted median annualized time under 1IU/dL FVIII activity for subjects on episodic treatment was 224.81 days, which was shortened to 51.55 days in subjects on a fixed prophylactic dose of 65 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc once weekly, and further reduced to 2.17 days in subjects on tailored prophylactic regimens (25 \u2013 65 IU/kg, every 3 \u2013 5 days). Multivariable negative binomial regression analysis showed that the number of overall bleeding episodes increased with increased time spent under 1IU/dL of FVIII activity level (p<0.001). A significant association was also observed for the time under 1IU/dL and the individual bleed types (spontaneous, traumatic, and joint) when analyzed separately. In addition, across all subtypes of bleeding, there was a significant decrease in the odds of being bleed-free for each one day increase in the time spent under 1IU/dL of FVIII activity. Conclusions In subjects treated with rFVIIIFc in the A-LONG study, there was a significant association between increased time spent under 1IU/dL of FVIII activity and increased bleeding tendency, as well as decreased odds of being bleed-free. The findings reinforce the importance of a therapeutic threshold of 1 IU/dL of FVIII activity as reported previously, and contribute to building a stronger foundation for designing effective rFVIIIFc prophylactic dosing regimens based on population PK simulations of FVIII activity.
