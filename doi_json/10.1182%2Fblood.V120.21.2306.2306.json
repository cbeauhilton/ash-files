    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2306 Thrombocytopenia complicates many diseases and can be a life-threatening consequence of genotoxic treatments including chemotherapy and radiation therapy. It is well established that thrombopoiesis occurs in the bone marrow where mature megakaryocyte (MK) precursor cells associate with sinusoidal endothelial cells and extrude pro-platelets into the vasculature. There has been much interest in elucidating mechanisms that control megakaryopoiesis and in utilizing these pathways to increase platelet output. The leading paradigm of megakaryopoiesis centers on the ability of cytokines, chiefly thrombopoietin (TPO), to promote MK progenitor proliferation and MK precursor maturation. More recently, attention has been focused on the ability of the bone marrow microenvironment to promote MK maturation and platelet formation. The chemokine stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1, also known as CXCL12), signaling through its receptor CXCR4, is implicated in the chemotaxis of MKs toward sinusoidal vessels, and in vivo evidence demonstrates that sustained plasma elevation of SDF-1 can increase platelet counts (Avecilla et al. Nature Medicine, 2004). To more specifically determine the short-term effects of SDF-1, we injected mice with a single 400ng intravenous dose of SDF-1 and enumerated the progenitor, precursor, and platelet compartments of the MK lineage. At 24 hours, SDF-1 induced a 30% increase in platelets compared to vehicle control (p0.7 and p>0.5). To quantitatively determine if SDF-1 regulates the physical interactions of MK precursors with sinusoidal endothelium, we developed a double immunohistochemistry assay using Gp1B\u03b2 to distinguish MK precursors and MECA32 to identify vascular endothelial cells. In vehicle-treated mice, 39% of MKs in the marrow localized to the sinusoidal endothelium, and this increased to 53% 24 hours following SDF-1 treatment (p0.4 and p>0.7). As the platelet response following SDF-1 was less robust in the setting of TBI injury, we hypothesized that SDF-1-induced thrombopoiesis may improve if the number of MK precursors available to move to the vascular niche is increased. To test this, we administered TPO and SDF-1 at 2 hours and at 4 days, respectively, following TBI. TPO treatment alone resulted in 15% more MK precursors than irradiated vehicle controls at 5 days post-TBI (p0.2). In contrast, mice receiving both TPO and SDF-1 had over 20% more platelets than irradiated vehicle controls (p0.9). Correcting for differences in MK precursor numbers, mice receiving TPO and SDF-1 post-TBI had 1.8-fold more MKs in the vascular niche than irradiated vehicle controls (p<0.03) and 1.4-fold more than mice treated with TPO only (p<0.02). Taken together, we provide quantitative data in support of the concept that SDF-1 acutely promotes increases in the number of MK precursors in the vascular niche as well as peripheral platelet counts, and this effect correlates with the number of MK precursors in the marrow. Therapeutic approaches combining agents that first increase MK number and secondly increase MKs poised for thrombopoiesis by localization within the vascular niche may be a novel strategy to maximally increase peripheral platelet counts.
