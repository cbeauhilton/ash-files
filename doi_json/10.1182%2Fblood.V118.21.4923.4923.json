    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4923 Objective To explore the safety and clinic therapeutic effects of using tumor activated dendritic cells (DC) accompanied cytokine induced killer (CIK) in order to feinforce opposing anti-tumor function and to eliminate minimal residual disease. Methods 59 patients entered into DCIK plus chemotherapy consolidation teams as achieved the 1 st complete remission and after 1 or 2 cycle themotherapy. Collect 56 case's bone marrow monocyte cells at diagnosising to prepare tumor antigen, Collect bone marrow monocyte cells at complete remission to culture DC and CIK, using tumor antigen to activate DCs. After 7 days culturing separately then co-culture together for 1 day, collect these cells as DCs activated CIK, after scrubbing, infusing back to patients. Then these patients accept 10\u201315 day's immuno-regulation treatment, such as interleukine-2(IL-2) 500000u/d for one week or interferon -\u03b1(IFN-\u03b1)3,000,000u/d three times one week or thymopentin 1mg/d,2 times every week for two weeks. Those cases (one case AML-M3a,one case ALL-B,one case AML-M4a)only have routine culturing and infusion of DCs and CIK and the DCs are not activated by tumor antigen because of having no conservation leukemic cells. Results 59 cases accept DCIK immuno-therapy for 6 to 16 times respectively, in the 24 to 78 months observation stage, 42 cases OS(overall survival)and 33 cases DFS(disease free survival). No one developed therapeutic-dependent auto-allergic disease, such as fever, swollen, diarrhea, rash et al. Those three cases who accepted routine culturing and infusion of CIK and DCs that had not activated by tumor antigen didn't occure any treatment-dependency side-effects and keep hematologic complete remission, minimal residual disease test outcome persist lower under 10 3 . Conclusion Tumor antigen activated DCs combined with CIK can reinforce anti-tumor immune function and have no obviously side-effects,accompanying with chemotherapy,those patients maybe benefit of this kind consolidation treatment and avoid routine chemo-therapeutic side reaction, temporary curative effect are satisfaction and worth popularized.
