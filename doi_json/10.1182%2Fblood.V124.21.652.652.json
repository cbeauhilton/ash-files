    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Notch has long been recognized as an important molecule that regulates stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Despite that Notch is required for the embryonic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) generation, and that Notch is expressed in the adult HSC, the role of Notch pathway in adult HSC remains unclear. Recently it has been shown that Notch activation and the ability of interacting with Notch ligand Jagged1 is a signature of human primitive HSC and supports HSC regenerative potential. Here we study the physiological significance of Notch in the adult HSC population focusing on how Notch-ligand engagement regulates HSC quiescence and niche retention. METHODS: To better understand the role of Notch in adult HSC homeostasis, we examined HSC frequency, quiescence maintenance, niche occupancy, and HSC mobilization in mice with either conditional lack of RBP-J K , which mediates the canonical Notch signaling activity, or in mice with conditional lack of Pofut1 that catalyzes O-fucosylation of Notch EGF-like repeats and the generation of O-fucose glycans important for the binding of Notch ligands. We also tested Notch ligand neutralizing antibodies and Notch1 and Notch2 inhibitory antibodies to examine the effect of blocking Notch receptor-ligand engagement or the block of Notch signaling activation on HSC homeostasis. RESULTS: We report here that Pofut1-deficient hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) display enhanced cell cycling and proliferation cell autonomously. These changes are accompanied by G-CSF-independent increased HSPC egress from the marrow to the periphery and other hematopoietic organs, and their enhanced sensitivity to mobilizing stimuli of G-CSF plus the CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100. This phenotype is caused by reduced adhesion of Pofut1-deficient HSPC to Notch ligand-expressing stromal cells and the osteoblastic lineage cells. Adhesion to these cells by wild type but not Pofut1-deficient HSPCs can be blocked by recombinant Notch ligand Dll1 or Dll4. In addition, adhesion to these cells inhibits wild type but not Pofut1-deficient HSPC cycling, independent of RBP-J k -mediated Notch signaling. Further, Pofut1-deficient HSPCs exhibit normal expression of key adhesion molecules and normal SDF-1-mediated chemotaxis, but show scattered and distal occupancy in the endosteal or osteoblastic niche. In support of roles for Notch-ligand engagement in facilitating HSPC niche retention, we show that mice receiving 4 doses of neutralizing antibodies to the Notch ligand Dll4 or Jagged1, but not Dll1, display ~2-3-fold increased HSC and progenitor egress when compared to mice receiving isotype control antibody, and further display 60% increased HSC mobilization when compared to mice receiving control antibody and treated similarly with G-CSF and AMD3100. Dll4 blockade also increases the sinusoidal endothelial cell population and HSPC cell cycling. In comparison, only a mild HSPC proliferation and egress is found in RBP-J K -deficient mice, or in mice receiving Notch2 inhibitory antibody. However, Notch2 blockade but not Notch1 blockade induces unique features of HSC and myeloid progenitor mobilization responding to G-CSF plus AMD3100. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, we conclude that HSPC quiescence and retention in the marrow niche is facilitated by the interaction between Notch-expressing HSPCs and Jagged1- or Dll4-expressing niche cells, and is likely also contributed by Notch signaling activation. In addition, Notch receptor-ligand engagement in this process is strengthened by O-fucose modification of Notch receptors. Finally, the observations from our studies may provide a therapeutic indication. Inadequate mobilization in HSPC transplantation remains a clinical problem. Our findings that targeting Notch receptor-ligand interaction and/or inhibiting Notch2 activation increase HSPC emigration suggests a novel approach for enhancing mobilization of stem and progenitor cells for those patients who respond poorly to current mobilizing regimes.
