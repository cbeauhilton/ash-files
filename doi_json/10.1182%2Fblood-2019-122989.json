    "abstract_text": "Objective : At present, patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are gradually increasing due to hematological diseases. However, there are no further studies on the factors affecting the effect of platelet transfusion during HSCT. This study analyzed the possible factors that affect the platelet transfusion efficiency. Methods: The clinical data of patients with HSCT were collected from the Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital Affiliated to Southeast University from March 2015 to March 2018. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a retrospective statistical analysis on the factors affecting the infusion effect was taken in all patients from +1 d to the day that the peripheral blood granulocyte count was more than 0.5\u00d710 9 /L after transplantation. The factors are including gender, age, types of disease, whether initial treatment, platelet inventory days in the effective period, types of transplantation, duration of disease and transfusion times. Furthermore, non-conditional logistic regression analysis was performed on the mentioned factors with statistical significance. Results: A total of 52 patients, 299 platelet transfusions were included in this study. The patients involve 28 men and 24 women, and there were 233 effective infusion and 66 invalid infusion. After chi-square test, the effects of gender, age, disease types, whether initial treatment, transplantation types, duration of disease and transfusion times on platelet transfusion were statistically significant( P< 0.05), while platelet inventory days within the validity period had no statistically significant effect on platelet transfusion ( P \u2265 0.05 ). Furthermore, the results of non-conditional logistic regression analysis showed that gender, disease type and whether initial treatment had a statistically significant impact on the effect of platelet transfusion ( P<0.05 ). Conclusion: There are many factors related to poor platelet transfusion during HSCT, in which the gender, disease types and whether initial treatment are the main influencing factors.
