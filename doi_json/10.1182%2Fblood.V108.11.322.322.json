    "abstract_text": "We previously demonstrated early safety and efficacy of fixed-dose IV BuFlu. Here we compare IV BuFlu and IV BuCy2, with long follow-up in a large number of pts. Since pts were treated on consecutive, not randomized programs, we used pts receiving Flu-Melphalan (M) in a program spanning the time of the IV Bu-based studies to estimate/correct for this non-randomized \u201cperiod\u201d effect. Methods: 293 pts received Bu 130 mg/m2, Flu 40 mg/m2 (after April 2001; n=148); Bu 0.8 mg/kg \u00d7 16, Cy 60 mg/kg \u00d7 2 (before April 2001; n=67); Flu 30mg/m2 \u00d7 4, M 140\u2013180 mg/m2 (FM; before and after April 2001; n=78). Patients received FM mainly based on higher age and coorbidities. Graft-vs-host dx (GVHD) prophylaxis was tacrolimus-based. Bayesian log-normal regression models were used to assess covariate- and treatment effects on survival, non-relapse mortality (NRM) and time to progressive disease (TPD). Covariates and survival model are shown in the table. The model accounts for the \u201cperiod\u201d effect, the effects of Bu-vs-FM, and Flu-vs-Cy within IV Bu pts. Patient and treatment characteristics were (BuFlu, BuCy2 and FM): median age 46 (19\u201366), 39 (13\u201364) and 54 (22\u201374) years. At HSCT 47%, 48% and 21% of the patients were in CR1-3. Donors were HLA-identical siblings in 53%, 79% and 41%. 30% of the Bu groups and 47% of FM had poor prognosis cytogenetics. Results: Median follow-up in months (BuFlu, BuCy2 and FM; alive pts): 30 (9\u201356; n=80; all but 2 pts followed for at least 1 yr), 69 (24\u2013102; n=23) and 48 (17\u201389, n=25). 100-day NRM for pts in CR at HSCT was 2% and 9% after Bu-Flu and BuCy2, while 1 yr-NRM was 7% and 18%. BuFlu produced significantly better EFS (P=0.04) and overall NRM (P=0.02) than BuCy2, but TPD was similar (P=0.34). 2-yr actuarial survival (CR pts): 75% (BuFlu) vs. 50% (BuCy), P=0.01. Conclusion: After accounting for covariate and treatment period effects, there was a significant benefit to being treated with BuFlu compared to BuCy2 in spite of a higher median age and proportion of MUDs. The benefit was most evident for CR-pts due to a significant reduction in NRM, without loss of antileukemic activity due to exchanging Cy with Flu.
