    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Recent data show that Multiple Myeloma (MM) always progresses from a precursor state (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [MGUS]/smoldering multiple myeloma [SMM]) to overt MM indicating that there is continuous dissemination/clonal evolution of tumor cells from the original stages of tumor development to the time of clinical presentation. A major challenge in understanding the progression and metastasis of MM is to distinguish alterations driving the tumor growth and evolution from passenger mutations. Genetic screens are powerful tools for assaying phenotypes and identifying causal genes in various hallmarks of cancer progression. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system has emerged as a powerful technology to efficiently and simultaneously perform genome editing of multiple genes. Here we report a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of function screen in a xenograft mouse model to investigate the essential drivers of tumor growth and metastasis in MM. Methods: Lentiviral particles from 2 subpools of a human sgRNA library (Avana), each containing 1 sgRNA per gene were introduced into MM1.S (Cas9+/GFP+/Luc+) cell line with the pre-determined amount of virus to achieve 30-50% infection efficiency, corresponding to a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of ~0.5-1. Cells were selected with puromycin for 5-7 days following infection to remove uninfected cells. Selected cells were injected subcutaneously into SCID-Beige mice on both flanks. Genomic DNA from pre-transplantation cells, early primary tumors (~3 weeks post tumor cell injection), late stage primary tumors and metastatic bone marrow samples were extracted. gDNA was amplified following adaptor ligation and barcoding of the samples and PCR products were subsequently sequenced on a HiSeq2000 (Illumina). Results: To investigate the sgRNA library dynamics in different sample types (pre-transplantation cells, early primary tumor, late primary tumor, and bone marrow metastasis), we compared the overall distributions of sgRNAs from all sequenced samples. The early tumor sample replicates of both subpools on average retained 77.3% and 94.7% of the sgRNAs found in the pre-transplanted cell populations, while the late primary tumors retained 59.4% and 65.6% of the sgRNAs respectively, compared to early tumors. Interestingly, only a small fraction of sgRNAs (1.1% and 3.4% of sgRNAs in the pre-transplantation cells, 10.7% and 7.2% of sgRNAs in the late primary tumors for the 2 subpools respectively) were detected in the metastatic bone marrow samples. Using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we found that the gene targets of the most enriched sgRNAs in the bone marrow samples were preferentially involved in important cellular processes, such as cell cycle regulation, protein translation, and several signaling pathways. Additionally we compared sgRNAs present in early primary tumor versus pre-transplantation cells and late primary tumor and found that many sgRNAs were depleted during tumor progression, indicating that their target genes were important for progression. These depleted sgRNAs in both stages mainly targeted genes involved in mTORC1 and DNA repair pathways, many of which are regulated by MYC and cell cycle related targets of E2F transcription factors. Conclusion: We established a platform for future in vivo Cas9 screens using the genome-wide CRISPR screening libraries to explore potential new targets in regulating tumor dissemination, colonization and metastasis in MM. In addition, this in vivo screening could potentially be used to investigate essential genes of response to targeted therapies or/and immunotherapies. Thus, CRISPR/Cas9-based in vivo screening is a powerful tool for functional genomics discoveries. Disclosures Roccaro: Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited: Honoraria.
