    "abstract_text": "Purpose To observe the level of leukocyte surface antigen CD64 during adult sepsis, and to assess the value of the CD64 in early diagnosis of adult sepsis. Methods We measured peripheral blood samples of neutrophil CD64 expression in 58 patients with suspected sepsis and 10 healthy controls. Results The expression level of CD64 in sepsis group was significantly higher than healthy control group ( P < 0. 001). According to the ROC curve, when the best threshold in diagnosis of adult sepsis was 1.075%,the sensitivity for indentifing adult sepsis was 98. 3 % and the specificity was 90.0%. Conclusions The expression level of CD64 will rise during adult sepsis. CD64 can be an early effective diagnosis marker in adult sepsis.",
