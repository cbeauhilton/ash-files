    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are maintained by a specialized bone marrow microenvironment (niche) and are largely quiescent during the steady-state conditions 1 . However, upon stimulation or transplantation, HSCs can expand and differentiate into any mature hematopoietic cell type. This ability of donor HSCs to reform a recipient's hematopoietic system is key to the success of HSC transplantation (HSCT). For donor HSCs to engraft, the recipient bone marrow niche must first be emptied via myeloablative irradiation or chemotherapy. However, myeloablative conditioning can cause severe complications and even mortality. As an alternative, we have recently developed a metabolic conditioning approach for HSCT. By screening the amino acid requirements of HSCs, we identified the essential amino acid valine as indispensable for the expansion and maintenance of HSCs 2 . Both mouse and human HSCs failed to expand when cultured in valine-restricted conditions. In mice fed a valine-restricted diet, HSC frequency fell dramatically within one week. Dietary valine restriction thereby emptied the mouse bone marrow niche and just a two-week diet afforded long-term donor-HSC engraftment without chemoirradiative myeloablation. We conclude that valine plays a critical role in HSC maintenance and suggest dietary valine restriction as a conditioning regimen that may reduce iatrogenic complications in HSCT. These findings, and recent efforts to optimize this metabolic conditioning approach through mechanistic understanding of the HSC valine dependency, will be presented.
