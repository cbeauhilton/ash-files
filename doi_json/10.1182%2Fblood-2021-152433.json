    "abstract_text": "Background: Although the incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is lower in minority populations, there is a difference in presentation, survivorship and participation in clinical trials (Becnel et al., 2017). African American patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) present with more aggressive features including higher lactate dehydrogenase, increased frequency of B-symptoms, and higher rate of HIV co-infection, while also presenting at a younger age than other patients. (Tiu et al., 2020). Given the association of race with lymphoma presentation and outcomes, minority participation in clinical trials is of vital importance when developing novel therapies. There have been efforts to increase participation of African Americans in cancer clinical trials including patient navigation outreach which resulted in improvement of 9% to 16% of patients approached (Fouad et al., 2016). However, a recent study illustrated that for DLBCL, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, individuals of African descent represented 1.5%, 2.3%, and 6.7% of clinical trial participants, respectively (Gopishetty et al., 2020). We are conducting the current study to identify factors that influence decisions regarding clinical trial participation in African American patients with NHL. Methods: We are identifying African American patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma who enrolled in a therapeutic clinical trial at Emory University between 2010-2020. We will utilize the electronic medical record to identify patient characteristics such as distance from medical facility, insurance status, type of insurance, comorbidities, education status, type of diagnosis, and race of diagnosing physician. This data will compare African American patients who participated in clinical trials to those who did not participate as part of their initial treatment, specifically comparing baseline characteristics of interest between the groups. Furthermore, the data mention above will be compared between African American and white patients. We are also conducting interviews with a selected group of African American patients that have opted to participate in therapeutic clinical trials to gain a thorough understanding of the barriers and benefits they endured during their experience. The interview questions are based on prior knowledge of clinical trials, distance to facility, religious/ spiritual belief, trust of the physician, additional expenses, and time corresponded to treatment. Patients are asked to rate the importance each factor in their decision to participate and elaborate on points most specific to them. In addition, the interview allows for discussion of possible factors that challenged their participation in clinical trials which may allow for insight on low participation levels nationally. Furthermore, we are going to target patients who enrolled on clinical trials and will subsequently identify patients who did not participate in studies to identify differences in perception of treatment and clinical investigation. This project is partnered with Accounting for the High Enrollment of African Americans in Winship Cancer Institute's Clinical Trials, at Emory University. Conclusions:This study is currently enrolling patients and will answer key questions related to clinical trial participation in African American patients with lymphoma. We aim for the data collected from this study to assist in creating lymphoma clinical trials that better cater to the unique needs and considerations of African Americans.
