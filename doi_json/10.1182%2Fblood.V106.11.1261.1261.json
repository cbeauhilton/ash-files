    "abstract_text": "Transplantation of human leukemic cells into severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice has been used to analyze developmental mechanisms of human leukemogenesis. Previous models, however, were limited in efficient or long-term engraftment of leukemia initiating cells. Here we report a new SCID model that supports highly efficient long-term engraftment of primary human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells. We have established a novel immune-compromised mouse by backcrossing a complete null mutation of the common cytokine receptor g chain onto NOD-scid mice (NOD/SCID/IL2rgnull mice), and reported that normal human cord blood-derived hematopoietic stem cells efficiently engrafted in newborn NOD/SCID/IL2rgnull mice as compared to NOD/SCID/b2mnull mice (Ishikawa et al, Blood in press). Injection of 5x106 total bone marrow mononuclear cells from primary AML patients (FAB subtypes: M1, M2, M3, M4 and M7) into sublethally-irradiated newborn NOD/SCID/IL2rgnull mice, however, did not result in efficient engraftment of AML cells, while predominant proliferation of human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was seen. These human T cells expressed CD45RO, and levels of human IFN-g in sera of the recipients significantly elevated, suggesting that human T cells were activated and inhibited the engraftment of human AML cells in the xenogeneic setting. We thus transplanted AML cells after T cell depletion. Strikingly, transplantation of 4x106 T cell-depleted AML bone marrow cells into neonatal NOD/SCID/IL2rgnull mice resulted in the efficient AML engraftment, whose levels were significantly higher than those in transplantation of the same number of T cell-depleted AML cells into NOD/SCID/b2mnull newborns or NOD/SCID/IL2rgnull adults. We also transplanted 103\u2013104 hCD34+hCD38\u2212 bone marrow cells purified from AML patients. These low-doses of hCD34+hCD38\u2212 cells also successfully engrafted, progressively giving rise to hCD34+hCD38+ and hCD34\u2212 leukemic cells over 16 weeks. hCD34+hCD38\u2212 cells purified from the bone marrow of primary NOD/SCID/IL2rgnull recipients again reconstituted AML in secondary recipients, indicating that this system supports self-renewal capacity of AML stem cells within the hCD34+hCD38\u2212 fraction. Thus, the NOD/SCID/IL2rgnull newborn system provides a powerful model to study human leukemogenesis as well as the interaction between human T cells and AML cells in vivo."
