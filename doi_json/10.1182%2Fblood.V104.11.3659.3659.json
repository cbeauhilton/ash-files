    "abstract_text": "GPIb\u03b1 binding to von Willebrand factor (vWf) exposed at a site of vascular injury is the first step in the formation of a hemostatic plug. In addition, GPIb\u03b1 binding to platelet-bound vWf has previously been shown to play a key role in the incorporation of circulating platelets into a growing thrombus. However, studies in vWf-deficient mice demonstrated delayed but not absent arterial thrombus formation, suggesting that GPIb\u03b1 may bind a ligand other than vWf to facilitate platelet adhesion, or that a platelet surface receptor other than GPIb\u03b1 can mediate platelet adhesion in arterioles in the absence of vWf. Here we studied thrombus formation in transgenic mice expressing GPIb\u03b1 in which the extracytoplasmic sequence has been replaced by an isolated domain of the human interleukin 4 receptor (IL4R-tg mice). Early platelet adhesion to ferric chloride-treated mesenteric arterioles in IL4R-tg mice was decreased by >98% when compared with controls. As a consequence, thrombus formation was completely inhibited in all of the mutant mice. To study the role of GPIb\u03b1 in platelet adhesion to already adherent platelets, we studied thrombus formation in wild-type mice infused with wild-type platelets labeled with calcein-green and IL4R-tg platelets labeled with calcein-orange/red. Upon ferric chloride-induced injury, wild-type but not IL4R-tg platelets incorporated into the growing thrombus. A similar result was observed with wild-type platelets treated with O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase to remove the 45 kD N-terminal domain of GPIb\u03b1. In summary, our studies in GPIb\u03b1 mutant mice provide additional evidence that under arterial flow conditions GPIb\u03b1 is the only receptor expressed on the platelet surface that mediates initial platelet adhesion to the subendothelium as well as to already adherent platelets. Our data further suggest that a ligand other than vWf may contribute to GPIb\u03b1-dependent platelet adhesion to subendothelium and to a growing thrombus.",
