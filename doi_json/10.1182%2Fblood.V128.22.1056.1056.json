    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a Ser/Thr phosphatase negatively regulates a diverse set of signaling pathways promoting tumor growth. While PP2A functions as tumor suppressor in multiple types of cancer, here, we demonstrate an unexpected pro-survival role of PP2A in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. By calibrating PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling strength, PP2A regulates glycolysis rate and thereby balances energy demands against anti-oxidant protection of pre-B ALL cells. In addition, PP2A reinstates activity of FOXO factors by dephosphorylation and thereby enables the anti-oxidant function of FOXO1 and FOXO3. Consistent with previous studies, we find PP2A is dispensable for the survival of myeloid leukemia cells which indicates a lineage-specific role of PP2A. Combined with genetic study and small molecule inhibitor, we verify that regulation in patient-derived xenografts and highlight PP2A as a therapeutic target in pre-B ALL. Results: Consistent with a divergent role of PP2A in pre-B ALL (compared to CML), we found that high mRNA levels of PP2A subunits at the time of diagnosis predict poor outcome of children (COG P9906; n=207) and adults (ECOG 2993; n=215) with ALL. Consistent with these findings, mutations in PP2A subunits are extremely rare in B cell malignancies but relatively common in solid tumors and myeloid malignancies (COSMIC). We therefore, studied the function of PP2A in a genetic mouse model for Cre-induced deletion of Ppp2r1a in BCR-ABL1 ( Ph + ) ALL. Inducible activation of Cre reduced protein expression of the targeted PP2A subunit A and the catalytic subunit C, which leads to near-complete loss of PP2A phosphatase activity. Conversely, Cre-mediated deletion increased phosphorylation levels of FoxO1, FoxO3a, p70 S6K and S6 ribosomal protein, which indicated elevated PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling. Acute deletion of Ppp2r1a fl/fl in B cell-lineage ALL cells dramatically affected survival and colony formation, both of which could be rescued by overexpression of wildtype PP2A. PI3K and mTOR inhibitors also have rescue effect on PP2A deficient ALL cells in growth-competition assay. Luciferase-labeled PP2A-deleted ALL cells showed reduced cell growth and leukemia progression after being transplanted into recipient mice. However, Cre-mediated deletion had no deleterious effects in a Ppp2r1a fl/fl CML model. This lineage-specific role of PP2A was verified by inducible CEBP\u03b1 expression to reprogram B cell lineage ALL cells into myeloid cells. Interestingly, inducible deletion of PP2A caused profound imbalances of glucose metabolism in Ph + ALL but not in CML cells. Upon PP2A-deletion, ALL cells showed higher glycolytic flux shunted into lactate rather than NADPH production. By employing glucose flux metabolic profiling assay using [1,2- 13 C 2 ]-D-glucose tracer, we found elevated glycolysis and repressed pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) flux in PP2A-deleted pre-B ALL cells. Lower NADPH/NADP ratio and higher reactive oxygen species level in PP2A-deleted pre-B ALL cells, together with decreased anti-oxidant gene expression, increased DNA damage, including H2AX phosphorylation and p53 expression. The mechanistic role of ROS downstream of PP2A was supported by a strong rescue effect of overexpression of the antioxidant catalase in PP2A-deleted cells. The unexpected role of PP2A in Ph + ALL was further validated by CRISPR-Cas9 mediated disruption of PPP2R1A in ALL xenografts derived from three patients. In addition, a PP2A specific inhibitor LB-100 (in clinical trial for solid tumors) was employed to pharmacologically inhibit PP2A activity. Low micromolar concentrations of LB-100 induced cell death in patient-derived ALL xenografts in parallel with ROS-accumulation and increased S6 and H2AX phosphorylation. Conclusion: Here we revealed an unexpected role of PP2A in maintaining redox homeostasis in pre-B ALL cells. By regulating AKT-mTOR signaling, PP2A keeps the balance of glycolysis and PPP to meet the energy demands of pre-B ALL cells and avoids extreme levels of oxidative stress. We confirmed this pro-survival role of PP2A in both genetic mouse ALL model and human Ph + ALL-patients derived leukemia cells. These findings highlight PP2A as a therapeutic target and suggest that agents like the PP2A inhibitor LB-100 may be of interest for pre-clinical development and testing.
