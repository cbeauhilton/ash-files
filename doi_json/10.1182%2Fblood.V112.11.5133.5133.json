    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Multiple myeloma (MM) is still an incurable disease characterized by clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells. New anticancer drugs further improve prognosis of myeloma patients. Despite promising clinical activity, some patients with MM failed to respond to bortezomib therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in protein expression of myeloma cell line ARH-77 after bortezomib treatment. Materials and methods: Myeloma cell line ARH-77 was treated with bortezomib (5\u201320nM) for various periods of time. The proteins contained in total myeloma cell lysate were separated by 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and the differentially expressed proteins between the untreated (control) and treated cell lines were excised and identified by mass spectrometry. Results: There were analyzed 94 proteins differentially expressed between treated and control cells; total of 34 protein spots were upregulated: proteins involved in regulation of apoptosis, chaperons/stress related proteins, proteolysis of ubiquitin/protein degradation and cytoskeleton proteins. Sixty protein spots were downregulated: proteins involved in synthesis, regulation of apoptosis, chaperons/stress related proteins, regulation of cell cycle proteins, proteins connected to glycolysis and proteolysis of ubiquitin/protein degradation and antioxidant/redox proteins. Conclusion: Employing optimized proteomic approach we identified 94 proteins with altered expression after bortezomib treatment.",
