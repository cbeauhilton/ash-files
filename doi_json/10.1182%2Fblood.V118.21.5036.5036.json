Methods The mRNA expression of TET2 in bone marrow mononuclear cells(BMMNC) of 25 patients with MDS and 16 controls were detected by RT-PCR . Results The expression of TET2 mRNA in BMMNC was down-regulated in MDS (0.9509\u00b10.3841)compared with that in controls(1.2515\u00b10.3749)( P <0.05), but was no significant difference of BMMNC expression of TET2 among RA, RCMD and RAEB. Patients with higher expression of TET2 (\u22650.9) presented significantly lower proportion of bone marrow blasts[(1.04\u00b11.68)%] than that [(6.13\u00b18.17)%] of those with lower expression (<0.9) of TET2 ( P <0.05). The expression of TET2 mRNA in BMMNC of MDS patients was inversely correlated with malignant clone burden ( r =-0.398, P <0.05) and IPSS ( r =-0.480, P <0.05). Conclusions The mRNA expression of TET2 in BMMNC of MDS patients decreased, which might useful as an important indicator for the evaluation of MDS clone burden .
