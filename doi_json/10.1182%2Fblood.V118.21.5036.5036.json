    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5036 Objective This study was aimed to investigate the expression of TET2 mRNA in the bone marrow mononuclear cells(BMMNC)of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome(MDS)and its clinical significance. Methods The mRNA expression of TET2 in bone marrow mononuclear cells(BMMNC) of 25 patients with MDS and 16 controls were detected by RT-PCR . Results The expression of TET2 mRNA in BMMNC was down-regulated in MDS (0.9509\u00b10.3841)compared with that in controls(1.2515\u00b10.3749)( P <0.05), but was no significant difference of BMMNC expression of TET2 among RA, RCMD and RAEB. Patients with higher expression of TET2 (\u22650.9) presented significantly lower proportion of bone marrow blasts[(1.04\u00b11.68)%] than that [(6.13\u00b18.17)%] of those with lower expression (<0.9) of TET2 ( P <0.05). The expression of TET2 mRNA in BMMNC of MDS patients was inversely correlated with malignant clone burden ( r =-0.398, P <0.05) and IPSS ( r =-0.480, P <0.05). Conclusions The mRNA expression of TET2 in BMMNC of MDS patients decreased, which might useful as an important indicator for the evaluation of MDS clone burden .
