    "abstract_text": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disorder characterized by hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents and diverse clinical symptoms, including developmental anomalies, progressive bone marrow failure, and predisposition to leukemias and other cancers. FA is genetically heterogeneous, resulting from mutations in any of at least eleven different genes. The FA proteins function together in a pathway composed of a mulitprotein core complex that is required to trigger the DNA-damage dependent activation of the downstream FA protein, FANCD2. This activation is thought to be the key step in a DNA damage response that functionally links FA proteins to major breast cancer susceptibility proteins BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA2 is FA gene FANCD1). The essential function of the FA proteins is unknown, but current models suggest that FA proteins function at the interface between cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair and DNA replication, and are likely to play roles in the DNA damage response during S phase. To provide a platform for dissecting the key functional events during S-phase, we developed cell-free assays for FA proteins based on replicating extracts from Xenopus eggs. We identified the Xenopus homologs of human FANCD2 (xFANCD2) and several of the FA core complex proteins (xCCPs), and biochemically characterized these proteins in replicating cell-free extracts. We found that xCCPs and a modified isoform of xFANCD2 become associated with chromatin during normal and disrupted DNA replication. Blocking initiation of replication with geminin demonstrated that association of xCCPs and xFANCD2 with chromatin occurs in a strictly replication-dependent manner that is enhanced following DNA damage by crosslinking agents or by addition of aphidicolin, an inhibitor of replicative DNA polymerases. In addition, chromatin binding of xFANCD2, but not xBRCA2, is abrogated when xFANCA is quantitatively depleted from replicating extracts suggesting that xFANCA promotes the loading of xFANCD2 on chromatin. The chromatin-association of xFANCD2 and xCCPs is diminished in the presence of caffeine, an inhibitor of checkpoint kinases. Taken together, our data suggest a model in which the ordered loading of FA proteins on chromatin is required for processing a subset of DNA replication-blocking lesions that are resolved during late stages of replication.",
