    "abstract_text": "Abstract 406 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a heterogeneous disease in which genetic lesions coordinately affect cell proliferation, differentiation and survival of thymocytes. Although pediatric T-ALL has been extensively studied on the genomic level during the last decade, large scale genomic studies in adult T-ALL are sparse. Importantly, significant differences in treatment outcome are present between pediatric and adult T-ALL. Here we performed integrative analysis of gene expression, copy number alterations and mutation analysis on 58 adult T-ALL samples treated in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) E2993 protocol. Unsupervised and consensus clustering of microarray gene expression data in this series revealed the presence of 2 stable gene expression clusters resembling immature/ETP (n=30) and typical (n=28) T-ALL gene signatures. Indeed, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) confirmed that our ETP/immature adult T-ALL signature closely resembled the previously published ETP profiles. In this adult patient cohort, the immature/ETP patient samples were associated with poor outcome (5 year OS 36% for ETP and 58% for non ETP TALL, P=0.088). Additional supervised analyses revealed differential expression of ERAP2, a gene involved in the processing of MHC peptides, between early relapse and long time survivor adult T-ALL patients. Consistently low ERAP2 expression was associated poor prognosis in adult T-ALL (OS 26%, 36% and 78% for 1 st 2 nd and 3 rd terciles respectively, P=0.016). In addition, absence of TCR gamma deletion (p=0.013) as well as the absence of biallelic CDKN2A/CDKN2B deletion (p=0.009) were shown to be poor prognostic markers in adult T-ALL. To gain additional insight in the biology of adult ETP T-ALL, we performed GSEA analysis using the immature/ETP gene expression profiles. This analysis revealed that the adult ETP T-ALL signature is more closely related to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) profiles as compared to ALL signatures. Given this, we hypothesized that myeloid specific genetic alterations might be uniquely present in ETP adult T-ALL. Mutation analysis of AML oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes revealed the presence of myeloid mutations targeting IDH1 , IDH2 , DNMT3A , FLT3 and N-RAS in 13/30 (43%) of adult ETP T-ALL cases, whereas only 1/28 (3.5%) typical adult T-ALL showed a mutation in N-RAS . Although these ETP adult T-ALL samples seem to have myeloid properties, they still retain T-lymphoid characteristics including activational NOTCH1 mutations in 12/30 (40%) of ETP adult T-ALLs. Of note, the myeloid specific genetic alterations were preferentially present in NOTCH1 wild type ETP adult T-ALL samples. Next, we used a systems biology approach to identify master regulators that might be able to drive the ETP signature identified in adult T-ALL. For this, we interrogated a T-ALL interactome that was constructed from gene expression profiles of 228 human T-ALL samples. This master regulator analysis identified MN1 as the key transcription factor driving the ETP signature. The MN1 gene was initially identified as fusion partner of TEL ( ETV6 ) in patients with AML. Notably, MN1-TEL expression in multipotent progenitors induces both AML and T-ALL and mutation analysis of ETV6 in adult T-ALL revealed the presence of 10 ETV6 mutants (9 frameshift and 1 splice site mutation) in adult T-ALL. Analysis of bone marrow remission genomic DNA confirmed the somatic origin of ETV6 mutations (3 frameshift and 1 splice site) in each of the 4 patient samples with available material. Most notably, ETV6 mutations were exclusively present in the ETP subtype of adult T-ALL. In addition, 8/10 (80%) of ETV6 mutant ETP T-ALL cases were characterized mutations in NOTCH1 , suggesting a specific interaction between the oncogenic NOTCH1 programs and the mutational loss of ETV6 in early T-cell transformation. In conclusion, our integrative genomic analyses in adult T-ALL unraveled a high prevalence of immature/early T-cell progenitor (ETP) T-ALLs, associates the pathogenesis of ETP-TALL with myeloid mutations and identifies ETV6 truncating alleles as the first ETP specific gene mutation that strongly interact with NOTCH1 in T-cell transformation.
