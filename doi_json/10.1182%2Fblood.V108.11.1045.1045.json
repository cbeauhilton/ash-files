    "abstract_text": "Acquired von Willebrand\u2019s syndrome (AVWS) is a rare but probably underdiagnosed hemorrhagic disorder often associated with hematological or cardiovalvular disorders. Diagnostic workup remains challenging, particularly in patients with normal or increased von Willebrand factor antigen (Ag) and ristocetin cofactor (RCo). Here, we present a retrospective single-center study of 35 patients diagnosed with AVWS based on (i) a history of recent onset of bleeding, (ii) a negative family history of von Willebrand\u2019s disease, and (iii) abnormal plasma VWF multimers. AVWS was associated with monoclonal gammopathy (n=11), cardiovalvular disorders (n=16), or other conditions (n=8) including myeloproliferative and autoimmune disorders. The PFA-100 \u00ae screening test was inconclusive due to anemia (hematocrit 0.8. A normal or increased VWF Ag together with a CBA ratio >0.7 was observed both in patients with cardiovalvular disease (n=9), gammopathy (n=2) and other disorders (n=4). However, in all patients the largest VWF multimers were decreased (n=14) or absent (n=21). In conclusion, no single test was sufficient to detect all cases of AVWS. The PFA-100 \u00ae test is of limited use in this population because of its limitation in anemia or thrombocytopenia and because of its low sensitivity. A significant number of patients present with a normal or increased VWF Ag and RCo as well as a CBA ratio >0.7 emphasizing the importance of multimer analysis in all patients with suspected AVWS."
