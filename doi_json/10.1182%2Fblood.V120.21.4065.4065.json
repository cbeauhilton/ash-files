    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4065 Background: Amplification of chromosome 1q occurs in 40% of myeloma and predicts lower response to induction regimens. We assessed if a PAD regimen overcomes effects of 1q amplification on overall response rate (ORR), event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in newly-diagnosed, transplant-eligible myeloma. Methods: This phase II trial enrolled 107 patients, stratified by 1q amplification. All could receive 4\u00d7 21-day cycles of PAD induction: bortezomib 1.3mg/m 2 D 1,4,8,11; doxorubicin 20mg/m 2 D1,4; dexamethasone 20mg D1,2,4,5,8,9,11,12. Responders proceeded to melphalan 200mg/m 2 and ASCT. ORR after PAD was primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included ORR 3 monthspost-ASCT, and 2-year EFS and OS. Results: 22% (20/93 evaluable cases) had amplified 1q. Median PAD cycles was4. ORRs were similar in amplified and non-amplified cases (100% vs. 87% post-PAD; 100% vs. 93% post-ASCT). After median 2 years, 2-year EFS was similar in amplified and non-amplified cases (70% vs. 75%; log-rank p=0.86), but with a trend to lower 2-year OS in amplified cases (86% vs. 94%; log-rank p=0.28). Common grade 3 or 4 adverse events included constipation (0% vs. 8% of patients), neutropenia (12% vs. 4% of patients), anaemia (4% vs. 6% of patients), back pain (4% vs. 6% of patients), neuralgia (0% vs. 6% of patients) and neuropathy (8% vs. 4%).

After 2 years, EFS was also similar, but with a non-significant trend to lower OS in patients with 1q amplification. Funding: This study is sponsored by Janssen-Cilag Pty Ltd, Australia.
