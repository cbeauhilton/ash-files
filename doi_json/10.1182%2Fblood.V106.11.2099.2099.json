    "abstract_text": "The CLL4 trial randomised 777 previously untreated patients between Chlorambucil (Chlor), Fludarabine (Fluda) and Fludarabine with Cyclophosphamide (FC). The median follow-up is 21 months. V H gene mutation status using a 98% cut off, CD38 expression using a 7% cut off, ZAP70 expression (Orchard et al Lancet 2004) and interphase FISH were measured on samples taken at randomisation. In an interim analysis 253/397 patients had unmutated V H genes. 32 patients utilised the V H 3-21 gene, of whom 27 showed restricted HCDR3 usage. 343/535 were CD38 positive and 131/261 were ZAP70 positive. 10/24 V H 3-21 cases were ZAP 70 positive, of whom 7 were unmutated. There was no significant association between V H genes and age, sex or a positive DAT. There were significant correlations between V H gene mutations and CD38, ZAP70 and FISH results.

Among 104 patients with unmutated V H genes and both ZAP 70 expression and response data available, there was no significant difference in response rates between ZAP positive and negative cases. In univariate analysis p53 loss (p<0.00005), unmutated V H genes (p=0.003), CD38 positivity (p=0.06) but not ZAP70 positivity correlate with poor overall survival. In multivariate Cox regression analyses, age (p<0.0001) stage (p=0.01) and p53 loss (p<0.0001) are significant for survival. When patients with p53 loss are excluded unmutated V H genes (p=0.007) but not CD38 or ZAP70 positivity are significant. In conclusion p53 loss identifies a small group of patients with both poor response to treatment and short survival. In the remaining cases, unmutated V H genes are associated with a relatively poor response independent of treatment arm, and with a shorter survival.",
