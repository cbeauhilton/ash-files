    "abstract_text": "Purpose: The c.*233G>C nucleotide substitution in the HBB gene was recently proposed as a novel \u03b2 thalassemia allele based on genetic analysis of 11 thalassemic individuals. Based on this single report, the c.*233G>C allele has been provisionally included as a \u03b2 (+) thal allele in a commonly used \u03b2 globin database (HbVar). The c.*233G>C is frequently seen in HBB gene sequencing for hemoglobinopathies. A clinical review was performed to determine the phenotype and hematologic characteristics of the c.*233G>C nucleotide substitution. Methods: At a tertiary-care pediatric institution, a retrospective review was performed of all HBB gene sequencing tests over a 30-month period. A chart review was performed for all cases with the c.*233G>C variant. Results: Of a total of 104 HBB cases, the c.*233G>C variant was identified in 18 individuals; 17 were heterozygotes and 1 was a homozygote (Patient 17) (Table 1). HBB gene sequencing was performed as part of the work-up for suspected variant hemoglobin (Hb) but can detect non-coding alterations including \u03b2 thalassemia alleles as well. Red cell indices in our series (Table 1) do not demonstrate the characteristics of heterozygous \u03b2 thalassemia (microcytosis, mildly elevated RBC count, and mild anemia). MCV and RBC count data available for 9 individuals showed MCV values in the normocytic or macrocytic range and RBC counts within the normal range for all 9 patients. Of 13 patients with recorded Hb values, only one patient (Patient 14) was anemic but was found to have iron deficiency. The patients in our series did not have elevated Hb A 2 , which in patients with \u03b2 thalassemia is typically above the normal range (>4%); the 9 patients who could be evaluated for Hb A 2 had values ranging from 2.4% to 3.7%. The remaining individuals were either too young to be evaluated for Hb A 2 or possessed a variant Hb that co-eluted with HbA 2 . The 13 patients in our series who were heterozygous for a Hb variant showed no excess in the variant Hb relative to Hb A. In patients with compound heterozygosity with a \u03b2 thalassemia allele, the amount of the variant hemoglobin typically exceeds the amount of Hb A.

Our analysis supports a hypothesis that c.*233G>C substitution is not a \u03b2 (+) thalassemia allele but is rather a fairly common benign polymorphism. This information has important implications in the diagnosis and genetic counseling of individuals with the c.*233G>C substitution. References: 1. Sirdah et al.
