    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2586 Even when intensively treated within pediatric-inspired protocols, about 25 to 30% of adults with ALL eventually relapse. With standard 4-drug or Hyper-CVAD salvages, post-relapse outcome remains very poor. Clofarabine is one of the new agents approved in US and EU to treat relapsing B-cell precursor (BCP) and T-cell ALL in children and young adults (up to 21 at initial diagnosis). In these patients, clofarabine is associated with a salvage rate around 30% when used as single agent. Combining clofarabine with conventional drugs in an intensive schedule may provide a chance to improve results in this difficult to treat population. Methods: Fifty-five patients were treated between March 2008 and February 2011. Thirty-seven patients received the VANDEVOL chemotherapy combining dexamethasone 10 mg/m 2 /12h day 1\u20135, mitoxantrone 8 mg/m 2 /d day 3\u20134, etoposide 150 mg/m 2 /d day 3\u20135, Peg-asparaginase 2.500 UI/m 2 day 7, and Clofarabine 30 mg/m 2 /day day 1\u20135 and eighteen patients received the ENDEVOL chemotherapy combining cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m 2 /d day 1\u20133 and clofarabine 30 mg/m 2 /d day 1\u20135. Median age was 34 (19\u201367) and 53 (18\u201378) years in the VANDEVOL and ENDEVOL cohort, respectively. The proportion of first relapsing patients was 68% in the VANDEVOL cohort and 39% in the ENDEVOL cohort. Fifty patients had BCP-ALL (including 8 Ph+ ALL) and 5 patient had T-ALL. Results: Complete remission was achieved in 15/37 (41%) VANDEVOL patients and in 9/18 (50%) ENDEVOL patients. Early death rate was 5/37 (14%) in patients treated with VANDEVOL and 1/18 (6%) in patients treated by ENDEVOL. Grade 3\u20134 infectious, neurological, GI, and liver toxicities were observed in 22, 5, 5, and 11 VANDEVOL patients and in 10, 0, 0, and 2 ENDEVOL patients, respectively. Thirteen patients in the VANDEVOL group and three in the ENDEVOL group received subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (overall transplant rate, 29%). After a median follow-up of 6 months, the median OS was 6.5 months. Conclusion: Combination of clofarabine with standard chemotherapy seems to be a promising and relatively safe approach to treat adult patients with refractory/relapsing ALL. This approach may be considered as a bridge to transplant in patients eligible for subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Updated data will be presented. The GRAALL will soon initiate a large multicenter prospective Phase II study using the VANDEVOL regimen. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
