    "abstract_text": "Introduction : We previously reported that plerixafor + G-CSF was as safe as and more effective than placebo + G-CSF in mobilizing hematopoietic stem cell for autologous transplant in patients with non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) through 100 days follow-up (DiPersio ASH 2007). We report herein the 12 months data. Methods : This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. NHL patients requiring an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant were eligible. Patients received G-CSF (10 \u03bcg/kg) subcutaneously daily for up to 8 days. Beginning on evening of Day 4 and continuing daily for up to 4 days, patients received either plerixafor (240 \u03bcg/kg) or placebo subcutaneously. Starting on morning of Day 5, patients began daily apheresis for up to 4 days or until \u2265 5 x 10 6 CD34+cells/kg were collected. We report herein the 12 months graft durability and hematology data. Results : As reported previously, 89/150 (59%) patients in the plerixafor group and 29/148 (20%) patients in the placebo group met the primary endpoint of collecting \u2265 5 x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg in \u2264 4 days of apheresis, p < 0.001. 135 patients (90%) in plerixafor group and 82 patients (55%) in placebo group underwent transplantation. Median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was similar in both groups. There were no differences in graft durability through 12 months follow-up between the two groups. Two plerixa for treated patients had graft failure (one had pre-existing MDS and one developed AML). One plerixafor-treated patient had delayed platelet engraftment. The hematology profiles were similar between the two groups through 12 months follow-up, except that patients in the plerixafor group had significantly higher platelet count at 12 months than patients in the placebo group (p=0.026) (Table 1). During the 12 months follow-up, 14/135 (10.4%) patients in plerixafor group and 10/82 (12.2%) patients in the placebo group died. 7/14 in the plerixafor group and 5/10 in the placebo group died of disease progression.  .

Importantly, this 12 months report showed that transplants with cells collected with plerixafor resulted in graft durability rates that were similar to cells collected with G-CSF alone."
