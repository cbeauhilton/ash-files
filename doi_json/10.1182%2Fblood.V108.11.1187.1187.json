    "abstract_text": "It is generally accepted that microRNAs (miRs) control basic biological functions, such as cell proliferation and differentiation. However, only few targets of the ~ 300 known mammalian miRs have been validated so far, thus hampering delineation of miR-based control circuitries. Particularly, little is known on miR function in mammalian hematopoiesis. We have investigated by microarray and Northern blot evalutation miR expression profiles in human megakarypoiesis, as evaluated in cord blood hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) unilineage culture through the megakaryopoietic (MK) differentiation-maturation pathway. These studies indicated that miR-155, -221 and -222 are abundant in HPCs, but sharply decline during megakaryopoiesis. The decline may favour megakaryopoiesis by unblocking translation of key functional target protein(s). Bioinformatic analysis predicted that miR-155, -221 and -222 target Ets-1, a transcription factor up-regulated in Mk differentiation, which transactivates relevant Mk genes (e.g., TPO receptor, PF4, CD42 and von Willebrand factor). Consistently, in megakaryocytic cells the increase of Ets-1 protein expression coincides with the miR-155, -221 and -222 decrease. To find out whether Ets-1 mRNA is a possible target of miR-155, -221 and -222, we cloned segments of the 3\u2032UTR of the Ets-1 gene downstream of a firefly luciferase ORF. Luciferase assay confirmed a direct interaction between each of these miRs and the 3\u2032UTR of Ets-1. Functional studies showed that enhanced expression of these three miRs impairs proliferation, differentiation and maturation of MK cells, at least in part via enhanced degradation of Ets1 mRNA and down-modulation of Ets-1 protein. Similar results were obtained by RNA interference against Ets-1. Finally, HPCs transfected with miR-155, -221, and -222 showed a significant reduction of their Mk clonogenic capacity, suggesting that down-modulation of these miRs favours MK progenitor recruitment and commitment. Altogether, these studies indicate that a novel regulatory circuitry, based on miR-155, -221, -222 multitargeting Ets-1 mRNA leading in turn to transactivation of Mk-specific genes, plays a key role in the control of megakaryopoiesis at both progenitor and precursor level.",
