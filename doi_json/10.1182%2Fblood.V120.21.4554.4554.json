    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4554 High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is currently standard treatment for younger patients with multiple myeloma, resulting in improved survival and response rate compared to conventional chemotherapy. Disease relapse, however, remains almost inevitable and thus the role of two successive (tandem) autologous stem cell transplants has been evaluated in chemorefractory patients as a means of prolonging duration of disease response. We retrospectively analysed the results of nine patients with chemorefractory disease treated at a single UK institution who received tandem ASCT between January 1998 and February 2009. There were six men and three women. Median age at diagnosis was 56 years (range, 42\u201365 years). Paraprotein isotype was IgG in eight patients and IgA in one patient. Median serum paraprotein level was 41g/L (range 12\u201373g/L) at presentation. At time of 1 st transplant six patients were in stable disease (SD) and three had evidence of progressive disease. Conditioning melphalan dose was 140mg/m 2 in all but two patients who received 110mg/m 2 and 200mg/m 2 . Median time between transplants was 3.7 months (range 2.3\u20136.4 months) with PR and SD being observed in 2/9 and 7/9 patients at time of 2 nd transplant. None of the patients reached complete response (CR). One patient received melphalan 140mg/m 2 prior to 2 nd transplant. The remaining patients received melphalan 200mg/m 2 . Median follow up after tandem transplant was 54.3 months (range 15.6 \u2013143.6 months). No treatment related mortality was reported. At the time of analysis, six patients were still alive and under follow up with an overall survival (OS) figure for the group of 52% at 10 years from diagnosis ( Figure 1 ). Median progression free survival (PFS) was 20 months from 2 nd transplant (range 6.7\u201362.6 months) ( Figure 2  ). Tandem autologous stem cell transplant in chemorefractory patients has resulted in overall survival similar to autologous stem cell transplant in chemosensitive patients and should be considered in patients with chemorefractory disease.
