    "abstract_text": "Background: CMV infection represents a major complication of allo-SCT affecting transplant related mortality and morbidity. Anti-viral therapy is toxic and prolonged treatment could affect graft function. Monitoring specific immune response against CMV could optimize the timing for anti-viral therapy administration in order to avoid related toxicity and to reduce CMV related mortality and morbidity. A recent ELISA based test (QuantiFERON\u00ae-CMV) could measure specific (anti-HCMV) and aspecific production of IFN-\u03b3 in whole blood. Aims: to test the reliability of QuantiFERON\u00ae-CMV in a cross sectional study in order to identify patients at risk of CMV disease after alloHSCT. Methods: QuantiFERON \u00ae -CMV is an in vitro diagnostic test using a peptide cocktail simulating human cytomegalovirus proteins (CMV) to stimulate cells in heparinised whole blood. Detection of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) by ELISA is used to identify in vitro responses to these peptide antigens that are associated with CMV infection. The IFN-\u03b3 response in the CMV Ag tube is considered positive if > 0.2 UI/mL as defined by the manufacturer. The mitogen-stimulated plasma sample was used as an IFN-\u03b3 positive control (PC) for each specimen tested. CMV reactivation and disease were defined according EBMT recommendations. Results: Among 92 tests no correlation between pp65 antigenemia and IFN-\u03b3 production was proved (p=0,346). However, among the 41 tests showing lower levels of anti-HCMV IFN-\u03b3 production (=0.2 IU/mL) none were associated with CMV disease (p=0.001), RR 2.5 (CI95% 1.951\u20133.321). Conclusions: QuantiFERON\u00ae-CMV doesn\u2019t seem to represent a significant reliable test for risk of viremia after alloHSCT, but patients with prolonged lower levels of anti-HCMV IFN-\u03b3 production (<0.2 IU/mL) are at risk of CMV disease. Prospective studies are required in order to identify the correlation between viremia and the need for treatment.",
