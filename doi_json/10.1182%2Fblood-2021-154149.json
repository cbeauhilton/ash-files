    "abstract_text": "Mutations in RNA binding proteins have been identified as pathogenic drivers in many hematological malignancies. However, in addition to mutational status, expression changes in RNA binding proteins likely impact disease processes. Through our studies, we identified that overexpression of hnRNP K (heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein K) -a poly(C)-RNA binding protein that governs the expression of numerous genes and transcripts- plays a pivotal role in myeloid malignancies. Using clinical samples, we determined that hnRNP K overexpression is a recurrent abnormality, occurring in nearly 30% of AML cases. Importantly, elevated hnRNP K levels associate with decreased overall survival (24.3 months versus 48.7 months; HR 1.9; 95% CI 1.3-2.7). However, the role of hnRNP K overexpression in AML remains unclear. To evaluate its putative oncogenic potential, we overexpressed hnRNP K in murine fetal liver cells (FLCs). Using colony formation assays (CFAs), we demonstrated that hnRNP K-overexpressing FLCs have an altered differentiation potential (increased number of immature (c-kit + Sca-1 + ) and decreased number of mature myeloid (Gr1 + CD11b + ) cells) and an increase in self-renewal capacity (increased number of colonies) (p=0.008). Mice transplanted with hnRNP K overexpressing FLCs had markedly shortened survival compared to empty vector controls, despite similar engraftment (median survival 8.1 weeks versus median not reached (HR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2 - 7.3, p=0.02). Significantly, extramedullary hematopoiesis was observed in the spleens and the hepatic parenchyma of mice transplanted with FLCs that overexpress hnRNP K. This resulted in disrupted splenic architecture and the presence of immature hematopoietic cells and cells of myeloid origin (CD117, CD14, and myeloperoxidase). Furthermore, analyses of the bone marrow revealed an increase in myeloid cells in hnRNP K transplanted mice. We next used unbiased and biochemical approaches to discover a direct interaction between hnRNP K and the RUNX1 transcript-a critical transcriptional factor often dysregulated in leukemia. Molecular analyses revealed hnRNP K-dependent alternative splicing of RUNX1 (delExon6) , resulting in the generation of a functionally distinct isoform that is more stable than full-length RUNX1. RNA-Seq and reporter assays demonstrated that delExon6 has a unique transcriptional profile compared to full-length RUNX1, suggesting this spliced transcript may have a pathogenic role. To examine the functionality of delExon6, we performed CFAs. Here, we observed that delExon6 expression results in an increased proliferation potential that is mediated by hnRNP K's RNA binding activity. Together, these data establish hnRNP K as an oncogene in myeloid leukemia through its ability to directly bind the RUNX1 transcript, modify RUNX1 splicing, and subsequently alter its transcriptional activity.
