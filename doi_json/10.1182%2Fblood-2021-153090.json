    "abstract_text": "Individuals with bleeding disorder diagnoses require developmentally sensitive care across the lifespan, particularly as they gain knowledge and skills necessary to successfully tackle their illness-specific needs as independent adults (Breakey et al., 2010). The current study describes one phase of a larger quality improvement (QI) initiative aimed at improving transition from pediatric to adult care (TAC) at one US Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center (HTC). Our aim was to assess the feasibility of delivering transition specific education to youth-caregiver dyads during youth annual multidisciplinary clinic appointments. Youth-caregiver dyads were selected given previous research revealing that both patients and their parents express worries about related to TAC (Geerts et al., 2008). Education included discussion of the knowledge and skills necessary for autonomous management of one's bleeding disorder (e.g., illness basics, treatment, communication, and healthy living). During an 8-month period, 101 youth-caregiver dyads were approached. Patients were between the ages of 12 and 25 ( M age = 17.66, SD = 3.45). Approximately half of patients were diagnosed with hemophilia A (53.5%) and 16.8% were female. Of the 101 patients approached, 90 completed the transition education discussion. On average, these discussions took 12.80 minutes ( SD = 8.49) and ranged from 5 to 50 minutes. Social work delivered the bulk of these discussions (78.7%) and spent an average of 10.61 minutes ( SD = 5.76) with youth and caregivers. While the intention was to deliver transition education to youth-caregiver dyads, this only occurred in 37 discussions. Other discussions included the patient only ( n = 31), caregiver only ( n = 20), or had missing data ( n = 1). In instances when a youth-caregiver dyad was approached, but a discussion did not take place, barriers to completing the discussion were identified. \"Provider\" was listed most frequently ( n = 5) as a barrier (e.g., youth sent home by medical team prior to transition discussion occurring; miscommunication between members of multidisciplinary team; low staffing of those trained to deliver transition discussion). Even in instances when a transition discussion did take place, barriers to having the discussion were identified. \"Patient\" barriers were the most frequently listed ( n = 13), followed by barriers related to \"Time\" ( n = 11), and barriers related to \"Clinic\" ( n = 3). At the end of the transition discussion, youth and/or caregivers were encouraged to identify a goal for improving their skills or knowledge in one of the four areas discussed during their appointment. Of those having transition discussions, 72 created a transition goal. The majority of participants reported goals related to Treatment (e.g., infusion skills; n = 36) followed by goals related to Communication ( n = 18), Healthy Living ( n = 11), and Bleeding Disorder Basics ( n = 7). There was a statistically significant difference in the type of goal of expressed by youth and/or caregivers when the patient was 17 years old or younger vs those older than 18, X 2 (3, N = 72) = 9.49, p = 0.024. Generally, more youth reported goals related to Treatment (e.g., infusion skills) than predicted by chance in both age groups. Patients or patient caregivers were contacted via phone between 5 and 14 months following their transition discussion. Approximately 1/3 of the patients who completed transition discussion, responded and provided ratings on progress toward meeting their transition goal. Ratings ( M = 4.24, SD = 2.63) were made on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 ( no progress made ) to 10 ( maximum progress made ). The information gleaned from this QI initiative revealed that delivery of transition-specific education within the CU-HTC annual multidisciplinary appointments is feasible and in some cases, served as the impetus necessary for accomplishing transition-specific goals. The results from this initiative have been instrumental in subsequent transition-related efforts related to: (a) fostering full engagement across the multidisciplinary team in TAC efforts utilizing HEMO-Milestones Tool (Croteau et al., 2016); (b) adopting specific materials developed to assess TAC in individuals with bleeding disorder diagnoses (i.e., American Society of Hematology Hemophilia Transition Readiness Assessment); and (c) reducing time between patient goal-setting and follow-up from the HTC.
