    "abstract_text": "Relapse acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is associated with chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis. Persistent leukemia initiating cells with increased self-renewal capacity, clonal heterogeneity and selection of resistance-driving genetic alterations have been proposed as drivers of leukemia relapse. Gain of function mutations in the 5'-Nucleotidase, Cytosolic II (NT5C2) gene are selectively present in relapsed ALL and confer resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). Yet, the specific mechanisms mediating constitutive activation of NT5C2 remain unknown. Here we performed detailed genetic, enzymatic, structural and functional analyses of relapsed leukemia-associated NT5C2 mutant alleles uncovering previously unrecognized functional heterogeneity in their mechanisms of action. Specifically, detailed nucleotidase assays in the presence of increased concentration of allosteric activators across 10 relapse-associated NT5C2 mutant proteins and analyses of the crystal structures of 7 distinct mutant proteins and wild type NT5C2 in the presence and absence of allosteric factors defined three classes of NT5C2 mutants with distinct mechanisms of action. Class I NT5C2 mutations force an active configuration of the NT5C2 catalytic center in the absence of allosteric activator. In contrast, class II NT5C2 mutations disrupt a novel switch-off mechanism mediated by the dynamic mobilization of the tip region of the arm segment responsible for returning the enzyme to its basal inactive configuration following allosteric activation. Finally, increased allosteric response in the class III p.Gln523* truncating mutation results from loss of the C-terminal acidic tail of NT5C2, which functions as a lock stabilizing the enzyme in its inactive basal configuration. The proposed role of the arm domain region and the C-terminal segment were verified in enzymatic assays incubating wild type NT5C2 with antibodies recognizing these regulatory elements, which phenocopied the increased enzymatic activity and response to allosteric effector of NT5C2 mutations involving these domains. In all, these results identify distinct molecular mechanisms mediating NT5C2 regulation targeted by activating NT5C2 mutant alleles and serve as a framework for the functional annotation of clinically-relevant NT5C2 mutations in relapsed ALL. Finally, the prominent role of the allosteric binding site as critical mediator of the mechanisms mediating thhe increased nucleotidase activity of NT5C2 mutant proteins point to this region as a preferred target for the design of NT5C2 inhibitors for the reversal of chemotherapy resistance in relapsed ALL.
