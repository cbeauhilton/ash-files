    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a genetically heterogeneous disease where risk stratification and outcomes are associated with translocations involving the immunoglobulin (Ig) loci and MYC , copy number abnormalities including gain(1q), del(1p), and del(17p), as well as mutations. Additionally, MM tumors may harbor rare mutations in genes that are targetable in other tumors, such as in IDH1 and IDH2 . Therefore, we designed a comprehensive MM targeted sequencing panel to interrogate the common genomic abnormalities in MM and validated it against known standards. Methods: The targeted panel was designed to include the exons of 228 genes which are either frequently mutated, associated with prognosis or risk stratification, clinically actionable, or sites of important copy number abnormalities. Additional targets were added across the genome to identify hyperdiploidy. These targeted regions encompass the mutation detection part of the panel and involve approximately 990 kb. The Ig loci and region surrounding MYC were tiled to capture translocations and copy number changes. In total, this translocation part of the panel involves approximately 4.7 Mb. The mutation and translocation panels are manufactured separately and combined during the assay resulting in a 5:1 sequencing ratio, respectively, which prevents over-sequencing of the large translocation panel. 100 ng DNA extracted from CD138+ bone marrow cells (n=223) and from non-tumor tissue (peripheral blood or saliva) was processed using the HyperCap workflow (KAPA Biosystems). Of the 223, 48 samples were processed in a clinical diagnostic laboratory. Adapter ligated DNA was hybridized with a mixture of the mutation and translocation panel and purified, amplified libraries were sequenced using 75 bp paired end reads. Sequences were aligned to hg19 and mutations and translocations identified using Strelka and Manta. Copy number was determined using the ratio of non-tumor to tumor reads in each targeted region. Data were validated using clinical FISH (translocations, n=116), MLPA (copy number, n=101), known standards (mutations), ddPCR (mutations), and whole genome sequencing (WGS; translocations and copy number, n=122). Results: Canonical IgH translocations were detected in 43.2% of patients by the panel, and all agreed with WGS. FISH detected one additional \"variant\" t(4;14), but did not detect 4 translocations detected by both sequencing methods. In the remainder of the samples no canonical IgH translocation was detected, agreeing with FISH results. Non-canonical translocations were detected in 14.5% of samples, 43% of which were to the MYC locus. MYC translocations were detected in 37.3% of samples with copy number abnormalities occurring surrounding MYC in 32.7% of samples. Overall, MYC abnormalities were detected in 46.4% of samples. Copy number was determined by panel sequencing and MLPA for 22 regions that were directly comparable between the technologies in 101 patient samples and 13 myeloma cell lines. The copy number concordance between the technologies was 96.9% and 99.6% in patient samples and cell lines, respectively. For the important prognostic regions, the concordance was R 2 =0.962 ( CDKN2C ), R 2 =0.986 ( CKS1B ), and R 2 =0.973 ( TP53 ). Panel copy number data were also compared to WGS data and showed complete concordance across the three prognostic regions, which the exception of 2 samples. In these 2 samples a homozygous deletion was detected by the panel but not by WGS. The deletions were 6.2 and 8.0 kb in size, one encompassing the coding sequencing of TP53 and the other exons 1-4 of TP53 . A larger homozygous deletion of 36.3 kb was detected by both sequencing methods. Mutation detection validation was performed using Horizon Discovery samples with known variant allele frequencies (VAF) for common mutations. We were able to determine the sequencing VAF for 74 mutations across 5 samples which had a concordance of R 2 =0.9849 between the expected and observed frequencies. The minimum detected VAF was 1.3% at an average depth of 891x. We also performed ddPCR on 6 patient samples with the common KRAS , NRAS and BRAF mutations which resulted in a VAF concordance of R 2 =0.9983. Conclusion: We have developed a targeted sequencing panel for MM patient samples that is as robust or better than both FISH and WGS. A full protocol for sample processing and analysis is available, and has been used in a clinical diagnostic laboratory.
