    "abstract_text": "The use of heparin for venous thromboembolism, upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), septic thrombophlebitis, loss of central venous device access in patients with cancer is a standard practice; a new clinical evidence suggest that low molecular weight heparin (LMWHs) may prolong survival in patients with cancer and may have anti-neoplastic effects and anti-metastatic activity. We evaluated 74 patients with cancer (38 patients were allocated to enoxaparin 6000UI subcutaneously once a day, and 36 patients were allocated to placebo), the mean duration of follow-up was 12 months, platelet count were performed before the treatment, and once a month; in the event of thrombocytopenia < 50.000/ml or abnormal bleeding the treatment was stopped. The primary end points were overall survival, and metastasis progression. TAB:A  . Enoxaparin (n.38) . Placebo (n.36) .

Heparin have show to have direct antigrowth, antiangiogenesis, and antimetastatic effects, LMWHs minimize angiogenesis with the inhibition of VEGF and b-FGF, inhibit the adhesion of cancer cells to endothelium and the interaction mediated by tumor cells surface mucins and selectin, and they interfere with cancer biology; we can speculate that the binding of tumor growth to heparin have a crucial role in the modulation of activity of the high affinity receptors, it promotes receptors dimerization and activation, inhibits P and L-selectins and chemokine action (IL-8, Mip-1), blocks MMP, serin-protease and heparanase, decreases over-expression of TF and PAF, induces and increases apoptosis.",
