    "abstract_text": "Abstract 551 Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is an inborn disorder of granulopoiesis characterized by chronic neutropenia, a block in granulocytic differentiation at the promyelocyte/myelocyte stage, and a marked propensity to develop acute myeloid leukemia. Approximately 50% of cases of SCN are associated with germline heterozygous mutations of ELA2 , encoding neutrophil elastase (NE). To date, 59 different, mostly missense, mutations of ELA2 have been reported. A unifying mechanism by which all of the different ELA2 mutants disrupt granulopoiesis is lacking. We and others previously proposed a model in which the ELA2 mutations result in NE protein misfolding, induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), and ultimately apoptosis of granulocytic precursors. Testing this (and other) models has been limited by the rarity of SCN and difficulty in obtaining clinical samples for testing. We previously reported preliminary findings of a novel transgenic mouse expressing a truncation mutation of Ela2 (G193X) reproducing a similar mutation found in some patients with SCN (2008 ASH abstract #314). We showed that the G193X Ela2 allele produced the expected truncated protein that was rapidly degraded. Surprisingly, basal and stress granulopoiesis were normal. We hypothesized that reduced expression of Ela2 in murine compared with human granulocytic precursors resulted in less delivery of misfolded mutant NE protein to the ER, attenuating UPR activation and preserving granulopoiesis in G193X Ela2 mice . Consistent with this hypothesis, only modest evidence of UPR activation was observed in G193X Ela2 granulocytic precursors, and these cells displayed increased sensitivity to chemical inducers of ER stress compared with wildtype granulocytic precursors. The UPR model of disease pathogenesis predicts that inhibition of the cellular pathways that handle misfolded proteins may sensitize G193X Ela2 cells to ER stress and result in impaired granulocytic differentiation. To test this prediction, we crossed G193X Ela2 mice with mice lacking protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK); PERK is one of three major ER-resident proteins that sense ER stress and activate the UPR. Of note, homozygous loss-of-function mutations of PERK ( EIF2AK3 ) are responsible for Wolcott-Rallison syndrome, which is characterized by infantile diabetes and neutropenia in approximately 50% of cases. Since PERK deficiency is embryonic lethal, we transplanted fetal liver cells from PERK -/- , PERK -/- \u00d7 G193X Ela2 , and wild type embryos into irradiated recipients. Complete donor engraftment was observed in all cohorts. Basal granulopoiesis was normal in mice reconstituted with PERK -/- cells. However, in the PERK -/- \u00d7 G193X Ela2 chimeras, though blood neutrophil counts were normal, a significant reduction in bone marrow neutrophils was observed [6.01 \u00d7 10 6 /femur \u00b1 0.92 (PERK -/- ) versus 3.14 \u00d7 10 6 \u00b1 0.88 (PERK -/- \u00d7 G193X Ela2 ); p < 0.001]. These data show that loss of PERK signaling combined with G193X Ela2 expression results in impaired granulopoiesis, providing new evidence in support of the UPR model of disease pathogenesis.
