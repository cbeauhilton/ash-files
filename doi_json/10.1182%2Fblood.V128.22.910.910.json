    "abstract_text": "Background: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric malignancy and is most often of B-cell lineage (Roberts, et al. NEJM 2014). One subtype of B-cell ALL, Philadelphia chromosome-like ALL (Ph-like ALL), is BCR-ABL negative with a gene expression signature similar to that of BCR-ABL positive ALL and is prognostic for poor clinical outcomes (Roberts, et al. NEJM 2014). Ph-like ALL is often associated with rearrangements involving the cytokine receptor-like factor 2 ( CRLF2 ) component of the thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor (TSLPR) leading to its overexpression (Shochat, et al., JEM 2011). TSLPR is a heterodimer of CRLF2 and IL-7R\u03b1 that signals to promote the proliferation and differentiation of B-cell progenitors and acts to promote B-cell transformation in the context of Ph-like ALL (Maude, et al. Blood 2012). Glucocorticoid (GC) therapy plays a central role in the treatment of childhood ALL and resistance to GCs confers a poor prognosis (Piovan, et al. Cancer Cell, 2013). This study examined the role of TSLPR signaling in mediating primary GC resistance and the effects of downstream signal transduction inhibitors to confer GC sensitivity. Methods: Viably cryopreserved splenocytes were obtained from 19 patient-derived xenografts of Ph-like ALL banked in the Children's Oncology Group or Children's Hospital of Philadelphia leukemia biorepositories. Assays were also performed using the Mutz 5 Ph-like ALL cell line. Flow cytometry was used to assess the protein expression of TSLPR and GC receptor (GR). Levels of pERK and pAKT were measured by phosphoflow cytometry at baseline and following TSLP stimulation. Cells were cultured in the presence of 1\u00b5M dexamethasone (dex), a GC, with or without 1\u00b5M trametinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, or 1\u00b5M MK2206, a pan-AKT inhibitor, in the presence of TSLP and viability was assessed by Hoechst staining and flow cytometry at 48 hours. Results: Of the 19 Ph-like ALL samples in this study, 11 were CRLF2 -rearranged ( CRLF2 R ) and 8 were non-rearranged ( CRLF2 NR ). CRLF2 rearrangements involved P2RY8 or IGH and 9 of 11 samples had concomitant activating mutations in JAK1 or JAK2 . CRLF2 NR samples expressed a variety of other translocations involving genes such as JAK2, PDGFR, and ABL1. CRLF2 R cells were shown to have significantly greater TSLPR protein expression relative to CRLF2 NR cells (p = 0.03). In the presence of TSLP, CRLF2 rearrangement status predicted responsiveness to dex, with CRLF2 R samples demonstrating significant resistance to dex relative to CRLF2 NR samples (p = 0.004). There was no significant reduction in cell viability following dex treatment in CRLF2 R samples (p = 0.5), while dex effectively attenuated cell viability in CRLF2 NR samples (p = 0.008). Importantly, there was no difference in GR expression between these two groups (p = 0.6). CRLF2 R samples demonstrated hyperresponsiveness to TSLP stimulation, with a significant induction of pERK and pAKT that exceeded the response of CRLF2 NR samples (p = 0.007 and p = 0.0005, respectively) despite no differences in basal phosphoprotein levels between the two sample groups. Inhibition of MAPK signaling with trametinib or of AKT signaling with MK2206 significantly sensitized CRLF2 R cells to dex in the presence of TSLP when used in combination relative to dex alone (p = 0.0003 and p < 0.0001, respectively) and resulted in a significant reduction in cell viability relative to untreated cells (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). The Mutz 5 cell line, which expresses both a CRLF2 rearrangement and a JAK2 activating mutation, was used to assess the effect of simultaneous pathway inhibition. Mutz 5 cells were treated with dex alone or dex in combination with trametinib and/or MK2206. While dex alone had no significant effect on cell viability, the addition of trametinib or MK2206 resulted in a 43% and 36% reduction in cell viability, respectively. Furthermore, combined treatment with dex, trametinib, and MK2206 resulted in a 72% reduction in cell viability, demonstrating the efficacy of simultaneous MAPK and PI3K pathway inhibition to confer dex sensitivity. Conclusion: MAPK and PI3K pathway signaling play a role in mediating primary GC resistance in CRLF2 R Ph-like ALL, making these pathways potential therapeutic targets for enhancing the efficacy of GC therapy in this patient group.
