    "abstract_text": "The TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway has an important role in regulating normal hematopoeisis, inhibiting proliferation while stimulating differentiation when appropriate. TGF-\u03b2 ligands regulate cellular processes by binding to three high affinity cell surface receptors: the type I TGF-\u03b2 receptor (T\u03b2RI), the type II TGF-\u03b2 receptor (T\u03b2RII) and the type III TGF-\u03b2 receptor (T\u03b2RIII or betaglycan). T\u03b2RIII has essential and non-redundant roles in mediating and regulating TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Our laboratory has demonstrated that T\u03b2RIII serves as a novel tumor suppressor in epithelial-derived solid tumors. Like most human cancers, multiple myeloma (MM) cells develop resistance to the homeostatic functions of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. While loss of T\u03b2RIII expression correlates with tumor progression in many epithelial-derived tumors, the role of this receptor in MM is unknown. Analysis of T\u03b2RIII expression in MM specimens revealed loss of T\u03b2RIII expression, which correlated with disease progression from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance to MM. Consistent with results in MM specimens, T\u03b2RIII expression was decreased at the mRNA and protein levels in MP399, NCI-H929, OPM2, and RPMI-8226 human MM cell lines, with only the U266 MM cell line expressing significant levels of T\u03b2RIII. To investigate whether decreased expression of T\u03b2RIII contributes to the pathogenesis of MM, we examined the effect of T\u03b2RIII on cell growth, apoptosis, proliferation, and cell-matrix adhesion. Restoring T\u03b2RIII expression in RPMI-8226 cells by adenoviral-mediated infection significantly (>50%, p50%, p30%, p<0.05). Taken together, these findings indicate that loss of T\u03b2RIII expression during the pathogenesis of MM may contribute to disease progression by promoting increased proliferation and decreasing adhesion of MM cells to the extracellular matrix. Current studies are underway to elucidate the cellular mechanisms for these T\u03b2RIII functions and to validate these findings in primary MM cells and bone marrow stroma obtained from MM patients."
