We herein report characteristics and outcomes of newly diagnosed DLBCL presenting in leukemic phase at 2 Institutions. Methods: Flow cytometry database analysis and retrospective chart reviews were carried out with IRB-approval for cases accrued between 2001 and 2008. Leukemic phase DLBCL patients were matched on a 3:1 basis with control DLBCL with no circulating lymphoma cells based on IPI, year of diagnosis, and age \u00b1 10 years. Results: 18 patients, median age 48 years (range 34-80), ECOG PS-1 (22%), 2(38%) and 3(40%), and IPI - 3(56%), 4(40%) and 5(4%) presented in leukemic phase. Extranodal sites included bone marrow (100%), spleen (83%), pleura (61%) and CSF (22%). 61% had B symptoms, and LDH was 6xULN (range, 1-56). WBC was 13,000/microL (range, 7,100-127,400), with 50% lymphoma cells (range, 2-92); these cells were immunophenotypically similar to those in the histologically confirmed DLBCL node, and co-expressed CD19, CD20, CD22, CD38, CD45, HLA-DR and FMC7 in >90% of cases, and kappa or lambda light chain restriction in > 50%. Karyotype was abnormal and complex in 61%. One patient expired before treatment began. Treatment consisted of R-CHOP (10), R-HCVAD (6), and single agent rituximab (1). 8 (44%) achieved CR (5 R-HCVAD and 3 R-CHOP), 5 (28%) PR, and 4 (22%) had resistant disease. 1 patient was autografted in CR1 and remains in remission. With a median follow-up of 32 months, 2 relapsed in leukemic phase, 1 of whom achieved CR2, but relapsed at the time of conditioning for a consolidative allograft. 10 (56%) patients died from progressive disease, 2 (11%) were lost to follow-up and 6 (33%) remain alive in remission. Overall (Panel A) and progression-free (Panel B) survival curves the 18 leukemic (solid line) and 54 non-leukemic phase (dashed line) DLBCL are depicted in the Figure . Conclusion: DLBCL presenting with circulating lymphoma cells is associated with chemo-resistance (44% CR) and poor outcomes with the exception of those who achieve complete remission. These patients are candidates for alternative therapies.
