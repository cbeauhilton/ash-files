    "abstract_text": "Cyclophosphamide+total body irradiation +/\u2212 etoposide (CyTBI+/\u2212V) is a standard conditioning regimen prior to auto-SCT for NHL patients. However, TBI-based dose intensive therapy is often contraindicated in older patients, or those with prior radiation. We performed a single-institution Phase II non-randomized prospective study of VCyTBI vs. Busulfan+Cy (BuCy) to determine if BuCy provides comparable disease control to standard dose intensive therapy with VCyTBI. BuCy was used in patients \u226560 years and when TBI was contraindicated. Seventy-five relapsed or refractory NHL patients underwent auto-SCT at Roswell Park Cancer Institute from 8/92 to 7/05. All patients were treated on a single IRB-approved protocol with standard eligibility criteria including age \u226518 and \u226470, adequate cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic and renal function and KPS \u226570. All patients signed informed consent and were followed prospectively. All data have been de-identified. Survival status for all patients was updated through 8/1/08. VCyTBI (N=47) consisted of V 1800 mg/m 2 26-hour continuous iv infusion on day -5, Cy 60 mg/kg day -4 (12 patients received 180 mg/kg total dose), and TBI 200 cGy on days -3, -2, and -1 for total dose of 1000 cGy (8 patients received 1200 cGy). BuCy (N=28) consisted of iv Bu 0.8 mg/kg every 6 hours on days -7, -6, -5, -4 (total 12.8mg, one patient received oral Bu total dose 16 mg/kg) and Cy 60 mg/kg on days -3 and -2 (total 120 mg/kg, one patient received total dose 200 mg/kg). Eight patients received iv Bu without dose adjustment and 19 received iv Bu with dose adjusted to maintain a steady state level between 600\u2013 900 ng/ml. Stem cells were re-infused on day 0. Patients received peripheral blood stem cells (n=53), bone marrow (n=14) or both (n=8). The median age was significantly higher in the BuCy compared to the VCyTBI group (61.5 vs 53 years, p=0.0002), and there were fewer patients with a KPS of 90\u2013100 in the VCyTBI group (75% vs 93%, p=0.07). There were no significant differences on the following patient characteristics by BuCy vs VCyTBI: gender, disease risk, stem cell source, histology (diffuse, follicular, mantle, other), or remission status at SCT. Treatment-related mortality at day+100 post-auto SCT was very low in both groups: 0% in BuCy and 2% in VCyTBI. However, 3 patients in the VCyTBI group and none in the BuCy group developed AML at 1.3, 1.8 and 6.5 years post-auto-SCT. At a median follow-up of 4.6 years, the 5-year progression-free survival for BuCy and VCyTBI was 32% (95% CI 14\u201350%) and 24% (95% CI, 11\u201339%, P>0.8), respectively. The 5-year overall survival for BuCy and VCyTBI was 46% (95% CI 25\u2013 64%) and 49% (95% CI 33\u201364%, P>0.7), respectively. Multivariate analysis controlling for age and KPS at BMT also demonstrated no significant difference between BuCy and VCyTBI for either progression-free (RR=0.9, 95% CI 0.5\u20131.8) or overall (RR=0.7, 95% CI 0.3\u20131.6) survival. This is the largest reported study evaluating the efficacy of BuCy as alternative conditioning for auto-SCT in relapsed/refractory NHL. BuCy provides equivalent survival outcomes to VCyTBI as conditioning for auto-SCT in NHL patients. Based on these results, our practice continues to use BuCy for NHL patients \u226560 years."
