    "abstract_text": "Background: Historically, CLL patients with cytopenia were thought to have a poor prognosis and cytopenia is a key feature of CLL clinical staging systems. The implications of cytopenia in CLL could have changed because of improved diagnostic accuracy, increased recognition of early stage disease, and better treatments. Newer data suggest that the etiology of cytopenia determines its prognostic importance in CLL. Patients with cytopenia caused by autoimmune disease (AID) are less likely to have the poor prognosis associated with patients with bone marrow (BM) failure. To determine the prognostic significance of cytopenia in patients with CLL, we performed an observational study at Mayo Clinic Rochester (MCR). Methods: We studied all patients with CLL seen in the Division of Hematology at MCR from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2004 (n = 1,750). Cytopenia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL or platelet count < 100 \u00d7 0 9 /L) was considered due to BM failure in patients with extensive BM involvement by CLL (< 20% residual myeloid tissue on BM biopsy) or reticulocytopenia without other causes persisting > 3 months after CLL therapy. Cytopenia was attributed to AID in patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), pure red blood cell aplasia (PRCA), or autoimmune granulocytopenia (AIG). Results: Median age at diagnosis of CLL was 63.7 years (69% male). Cytopenia occured in 423 (24.2%) patients. In 303 patients, cytopenia was due to CLL (228 BM failure and 75 AID). In 120 patients cytopenia was due to CLL related factors (splenomegaly, n = 11; possible AID, n = 18; treatment of CLL, n = 16) or non CLL causes (other malignancy, n = 12; iron deficiency, n = 11; anemia of chronic disease, n = 10; renal failure, n = 6; drugs effect, n = 4; surgical blood loss n = 4). In 28 (6.6%) patients the cause of cytopenia was not definitively determined. Of the patients with BM failure, 97 (43%) had cytopenia at CLL diagnosis (70% male, median age 63.3 years [range 32\u201395]), The AID patients the median age of CLL diagnosis was 66.7 years (range 30\u201385) with 79% male. AID diagnoses were AIHA (n = 41), ITP (n= 35), PRCA (n=8), and AIG (n=3); 9 patients had > 1 AID. Survival from diagnosis of cytopenia was significantly better for patients with AID (median 9.1 years) than BM failure (median 4.4 years, p < 0.001). AID patients had a longer survival from diagnosis of CLL (median 12.4 years) versus the rest of the CLL population (median 9.5 years, p = 0.020) but patients with BM failure at diagnosis had a worse prognosis (median 6.2 years, p < 0.001). Conclusion: We show that the etiology of cytopenia in CLL patients determines its prognostic importance. Anemia and thrombocytopenia caused by BM failure, but not AID, are associated with a significantly worse prognosis. These data show the importance of accurate determination of the etiology of cytopenia in all patients with CLL. Cytopenia in patients with AID is not a marker of advanced stage disease; these patients often need different management compared to those with BM failure. Cytopenia due to AID versus BM failure can be difficult to distinguish and a BM study should be done in all patients considered for treatment. Patients with cytopenia due to AID cannot be meaningfully classified by current clinical staging systems. We believe that efforts to review the NCI-WG 96 criteria are timely and should consider the etiology of cytopenia in CLL patients."
