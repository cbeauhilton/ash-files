    "abstract_text": "Iron overload is a potentially life-threatening medical problem for patients with chronic transfusion-dependent anemias who cannot receive adequate iron chelation with existing therapies. ICL670 (deferasirox) is an investigational, tridentate, once-daily oral iron chelator that has demonstrated high iron binding potency and selectivity. The efficacy and safety of ICL670 is being investigated across a broad range of patient ages in a Phase II multicenter study in 7 countries in patients who are transfusion-dependent due to a variety of chronic anemias. The study population includes patients with various rare chronic anemias (n=98) and \u03b2-thalassemia patients who cannot be adequately treated with deferoxamine (n=86). The rare anemia category comprises 47 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, 28 with Diamond-Blackfan anemia and 23 with other anemias of diverse etiologies. Between March and November 2003, 184 patients were enrolled in the following countries: Italy (57), US (36), France (20), UK (20), Canada (18), Germany (17), Belgium (16). Based on liver iron content (LIC) at baseline (2\u20133, >3\u20137, >7\u201314 and >14 mg Fe/g dw), patients were allocated to receive once daily oral ICL670 at doses of 5, 10, 20 or 30 mg/kg, respectively. Treatment was for one year initially, to be followed by an extension phase. LIC, the primary outcome measure, was assessed at baseline by liver biopsy or, when biopsy was contraindicated and also in some pediatric patients, non-invasively by magnetic susceptometry using a Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID). LIC will be reassessed after 12 months of therapy in each patient using the same methodology as at baseline. Liver biopsies are analyzed at a single center (Rennes, France) and 3 centers (Turin, Italy; Hamburg, Germany; Oakland, US) are performing SQUID assessments. At baseline, median (25\u201375 th percentiles) LIC was 19.6 mg Fe/g dw (15.1\u201328.8) by biopsy and 9.1 (6.8\u201313.3) in those patients assessed by SQUID. Baseline patient demographics and disease characteristics (median values) are summarized in the table. ICL670 has been generally well tolerated. As of 30 April, 28 patients, predominantly with rare anemias, had discontinued the study due mainly to complications of the underlying disease. The key efficacy and safety data from the initial 12 months of therapy will be available for presentation in early December 2004.  . Disease group (by initial dose) . .
