    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4908 Rituximab-chemotherapy relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas represent an emerging clinical challenge that underlies the need to develop alternative therapeutic strategies. Targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system using bortezomib (BTZ) has resulted in significant anti-tumor activity and potentiates the effects of chemotherapy/biologic agents in multiple myeloma, and to a lesser degree, B-cell lymphoma. CFZ is as a novel proteasome inhibitor which is selective and structurally distinct from BTZ. In an attempt to characterize the biological activity of CFZ, we evaluated its anti-tumor activity in several lymphoma pre-clinical models. Rituximab-chemotherapy sensitive cell lines (RSCL), rituximab-chemotherapy resistant cell lines (RRCL), as well as primary tumor cells derived from patients with de novo or relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma, were exposed to escalating doses of CFZ or BTZ (1-7.5nM) alone or in combination with doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine for 24, 48 and 72hours. Cell viability was determined by cell titer glow luminescent assay and cell cycle was analyzed by FASCan DNA methodology. Patient-derived lymphoma cells were isolated from fresh biopsy tissue via negative selection using magnetic beads. Western blots were performed using cell lysates from CFZ, BTZ or control-treated cells to detect PARP-cleavage and/or changes in Bcl-2 family members. CFZ was more active than BTZ and exhibited dose-dependent and time-dependent cytotoxicity against RSCL, RRCL, and primary tumor cells. We found a 10-fold concentration difference between CFZ and BTZ activity. In vitro exposure of RRCL or RSCL to CFZ resulted in G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. In addition, CFZ exposure resulted in the up-regulation of Bak and Noxa levels and subsequent PARP cleavage in RRCL. Finally, CFZ demonstrated the ability to overcome resistance to chemotherapy in RRCL and potentiated the anti-tumor activity of paclitaxel and gemcitabine in B-cell lymphoma cell lines. In summary, our data strongly suggest that CFZ is a novel and potent proteasome inhibitor which is able to: overcome resistance to some conventional chemotherapeutic agents, upregulate proapoptotic proteins to enhance cell death, and induce G2/M cell cycle arrest in lymphoma cells. Our preclinical data supports future clinical evaluation of CFZ in patients with refractory B-cell lymphoma. (Supported by USPHS grant R01 CA136907-01A1 from the National Cancer Institute).
