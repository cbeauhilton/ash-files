    "abstract_text": "Ligation of CD44 with anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody A3D8 induces terminal differentiation of human leukemia cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we examined the importance of MEK/ERK, p38 MAPK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt pathway in A3D8-induced monocytic differentiation of THP-1 leukemia cells. THP-1 cells displayed cytologic changes typical of mature monocytes and an increased expression of monocyte-specific antigen CD14 (49% \u00b1 4%) and of myeloid-specific antigen CD11b (68% \u00b1 6%) after 3 days of A3D8 treatment. The level of CD15 was also increased. The increase in the expression of these differentiation antigens was dose- and time-dependent. We found that CD44 ligation with A3D8 led to rapid and sustained activation of the essential kinases in the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway such as phospho-Raf-1, phospho-MEK1/2, and phospho-ERK1/2. However, the total levels of these kinases were not affected during the course of differentiation. Ser 473 Akt phosphorylation was also observed shortly after the cells were exposed to A3D8 and sustained thereafter. In contrast, the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and C-Jun N-terminal kinase were not increased by CD44 ligation. Pretreatment of cells with 20mM of MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 abrogated the A3D8-induced activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 and potently inhibited the THP-1 differentiation. However, a p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 did not abolished the CD44 ligation-induced terminal differentiation of THP-1 cells. Pretreatment of cells with PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 resulted in a nearly complete inhibition of A3D8-induced terminal differentiation. Overexpression of dominant-negative Akt also reduced the A3D8-induced THP-1 differentiation, suggesting that A3D8-induced THP-1 differentiation is coupled to PI3-K/Akt activation. Surprisingly, the pharmacological inhibition of PI3-K blocked not only A3D8-induced Akt activation but also A3D8-induced activation of Raf, MEK and ERK pathway. By contrast, pretreatment of cells with PD98059 did not inhibit the A3D8-induced Akt activation, suggesting that PI3-K/Akt is the upstream of Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in A3D8-induced terminal differentiation of THP-1 leukemia cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that the cross-talk between the activation of A3D8-inducible PI3-K/Akt pathway and the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in THP-1 cell exists, and plays a critical role during CD44 ligation-induced THP-1 differentiation."
