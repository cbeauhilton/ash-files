However, pts with refractory HL have <30% chance of long-term event-free survival (EFS), underscoring the need for more active HDC regimens. Methods: We developed a new HDC regimen of gemcitabine (Gem), busulfan (Bu) and melphalan (Mel) (GemBuMel) exploiting their synergy. Bu was given as 4 daily doses on days \u22128 to \u22125 targeting an AUC of 4,000/d. Mel was given at 60 mg/m 2 /d on d-3 and d-2. Gem was infused over 3 hours at a fixed dose rate of 10 mg/m 2 /min (total dose 1875 mg/m 2 ) on days \u22128 and \u22123 immediately preceding Bu and Mel, respectively. We compared the subset of refractory HL pts enrolled in this trial with all other refractory HL pts treated at MDACC with HDC during the same time period, who were eligible for the GemBuMel trial but either received BEAM off protocol or were enrolled in a separate trial of BuMel. All of these pts met \u22651 of the following criteria of refractory disease: primary induction failure (PIF) (defined as less than PR to 1 st line chemotherapy), CR1 1 relapse or progressive disease (PD) at HDC. Pts with relapsed but not refractory HL were not included in this analysis. Results: We analyzed 115 pts treated in one of the following three cohorts: 1) GemBuMel (N=51) since 01/07, median follow-up: 10 (2-43) mo; 2) BEAM (N=26) since 01/07, median f/u: 13 (3-56) mo; 3) BuMel (N=38) since 04/05, median f/u: 36 (17-56) mo. The GemBuMel cohort had significantly higher % PIF, median # prior relapses, % PET + tumors at HDC and % PD at HDC, with all other demographic and clinical features comparable ( Table 1 ). Table 1.

GemBuMel pts had improved EFS ( Fig. 1 ) and OS ( Fig. 2 ). GemBuMel was superior in patients with either PET- or PET+ tumors at HDC ( Table 2 ). Cox proportional hazards regression models identified the use of a regimen other than GemBuMel (HR 2.38, P=0.02 for EFS; HR 8.25, P=0.009 for OS), >1 prior relapse (HR 2.91, P=0.006 for EFS) and B symptoms (HR 6.57, P=0.009 for OS) as independent adverse outcome predictors.

A randomized trial of GemBuMel v BEAM is warranted. Disclosures: Off Label Use: Off-label use of gemcitabine for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Popat: Otsuka: Research Funding. Andersson: Otsuka: Consultancy.
