Patients were predominantly women (81%), similar to patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, and almost all white (94%), distinct from patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency ( J Thromb Haemost  2005 ; 3 : 1432 ). The short interval between exposure to quinine, ticlopidine, and clopidogrel and the diagnosis of TTP-HUS was consistent with an acute, immune-mediated mechanism, while the long interval between chemotherapy exposure and diagnosis of TTP-HUS was consistent with a cumulative dose-dependent toxicity. Calcineurin inhibitor-induced TTP-HUS has previously been described as dose-dependent toxicity. Although PEX was requested for all patients, 5 were not treated: 3 died before PEX was begun (quinine, ticlopidine, cyclosporine); 1 responded to plasma infusion (ticlopidine); 1 refused treatment and died (mitomycin C). Response to PEX, defined as achieving a platelet count \u2265150,000/mL, occurred in 96% of patients following quinine or clopidogrel compared to 42% of patients following calcineurin inhibitors or chemotherapy. Death within 30 days, attributed to TTP-HUS, occurred with all drugs except clopidogrel; death at 1 year increased only among patients treated with chemotherapy, caused by their metastatic malignancy. Conclusions: Quinine was the most common drug associated with TTP-HUS. Drug-associated TTP-HUS appears to have 2 distinct etiologic mechanisms: acute and potentially immune-mediated reactions (quinine, ticlopidine, clopidogrel) and cumulative, dose-dependent toxicity (calcineurin inhibitors, chemotherapy agents). Although the role of PEX in the recovery of patients with drug-associated TTP-HUS is unclear, PEX may be appropriate initial treatment since some patients appear to respond and since a drug-associated etiology cannot be certain when patients initially present."
