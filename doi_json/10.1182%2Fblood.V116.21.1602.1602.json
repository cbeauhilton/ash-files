    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1602 The hematopoietic transcription factor Ikaros regulates the development of lymphoid cells. In particular, Ikaros has been shown to suppress expression of Notch target genes in developing thymocytes. In addition, Ikaros-deficient animals fail to develop B cells and instead display a T cell lymphoproliferative disorder. Furthermore, alterations in Ikaros gene expression are associated with human lymphoid neoplasms and loss of Ikaros is associated with progression of myeloproliferative neoplasms to acute myeloid leukemia. However, the role of Ikaros in normal and malignant myelopoiesis is not well characterized. Therefore, we first analyzed myeloid development in Ikaros deficient mice and observed extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen and a striking thrombocytosis in the peripheral blood of 8\u20139 week-old Ikaros-null mice (2\u00d7106 platelets/\u03bcl, compared to 0.5\u00d7106 platelets/\u03bcl in wild-type littermates). Flow cytometry, histology and colony forming assays revealed that the bone marrow and spleen of young Ikaros-null mice harbored a substantial increase in the numbers of megakaryocytes and myeloid cells. We next investigated how Ikaros activity is reduced during terminal differentiation. Previous reports have shown that GATA1-deficient and GATA1s mutant megakaryocytes, which are associated with Down syndrome acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (DS-AMKL), express aberrantly high levels of Ikaros, suggesting that Ikaros is a target of GATA-1 repression during terminal megakaryocyte differentiation. By chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we found multiple sites in the Ikaros locus that are bound by GATA-2 in proliferating progenitors and by GATA-1 in maturing megakaryocytes. Furthermore, we discovered that GATA-1s fails to occupy these conserved Ikaros loci. Together these results strongly suggest that GATA-1, but not GATA-1s, displaces GATA-2 from the Ikaros gene during differentiation and that this GATA switch leads to repression of Ikaros, in turn allowing for terminal maturation of megakaryocytes. Since Notch participates in specification of the megakaryocyte lineage, we then asked whether Ikaros inhibited megakaryopoiesis by interfering with Notch signaling. Retroviral transduction of full-length Ikaros in murine common myeloid progenitors, but not in LSK cells, reduced megakaryocyte development upon Notch stimulation in OP9-DL1 stromal co-cultures. Ectopic expression of Ikaros in the 6133 cell line, which models the t(1;22) subtype of AMKL and shows aberrant Notch target genes activation by the OTT-MAL fusion oncogene, inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis. Genome wide expression profiling in transduced 6133 cells confirmed that Ikaros alters expression of several genes involved in the Notch and growth factor signaling pathways. These results indicate that Ikaros restricts megakaryocyte development and inhibits proliferation of OTT-MAL-transformed AMKL cells at least in part by suppressing Notch signaling. Together, our results suggest that a functional antagonism between the Notch pathway and Ikaros controls normal megakaryocyte development and that this axis is deregulated in AMKL, contributing to aberrant expansion of immature megakaryoblasts.
