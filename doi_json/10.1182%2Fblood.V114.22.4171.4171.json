    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4171 AVE5026 (Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France) represents an anti-Factor (F) Xa enriched ultra low molecular weight heparin (ULMWH) (Mw=2.4 Kda; anti-FXa activity \u223c160 U/mg). In comparison to Enoxaparin it has a lower anti-FIIa activity (\u223c2 U/mg). The oligosaccharide composition of AVE5026 also differs from Enoxaparin and other LMWHs. Besides the molecular and compositional differences, the biologic half-life of AVE5026 (18-20 hours) is significantly longer than Enoxaparin (4-6 hours). In order to compare the other pharmacodynamic differences between AVE5026, Enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin (UFH), a primate model (macaca mulatto) was used since its tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) profile is comparable to the human response. Individual groups of primates (n=6) were administered with 1 mg/kg SC of either AVE5026, Enoxaparin or UFH. Heptest and APTT measurements were determined on whole blood (WB) and plasma was analyzed for APTT, Heptest, thrombin time (TT), anti-FXa and anti-FIIa effects at varying periods up to 28 hours. TFPI antigen was measured using the assay from Stago (Parsipanny, NJ). Functional TFPI measurements were determined using the kit from American Diagnostica (Stamford, CT). In contrast to UFH, in the WB assays, neither the AVE5026 nor the Enoxaparin produced a strong effect on the APTT and TT, however both demonstrated a strong effect on the heptest assay. AVE5026 produced a much stronger effect with a longer half-life (T\u00bd=11 hrs) in comparison to Enoxaparin (T\u00bd=6 hrs). In the plasma based systems only UFH produced a measurable effect on the APTT and TT. However, in the heptest and anti-FXa assays, both AVE5026 and Enoxaparin produced a stronger effect, which was much longer with AVE5026 (2-3 fold increase). The plasma time course of TFPI antigen release was longer with AVE5026 in comparison to Enoxaparin and UFH. The ratios of immunologic to functional TFPI levels were also higher in the primates administered with AVE 5026. In the thrombin generation test, AVE5026 produced a sustained effect which lasted longer than Enoxaparin (T\u00bd =16.8 hrs vs. 9.2 hrs.). These results show that AVE5026 produces stronger anti-FXa effects in primates which are associated with a higher circulating level of TFPI and more pronounced suppression of thrombin generation compared to Enoxaparin and UFH.
