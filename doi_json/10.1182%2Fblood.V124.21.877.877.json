    "abstract_text": "Leukemias which arise as a result of translocations between the MLL gene and one of more than 80 different partner genes have a relatively poor prognosis. As a result of chromosome translocation, the carboxy-terminal portion of MLL containing the H3K4 methyltransferase domain is replaced by partner protein domains. In most cases this causes constitutive recruitment of transcriptional elongation machinery to MLL target genes. Downstream targets of MLL are aberrantly upregulated and include developmentally important HOX genes and MEIS1, as well as multiple microRNAs. Here we examine the contribution of specific miRNAs in the miR-17-92 cluster to MLL leukemia through the use of custom antagomiR oligonucleotides. Combinatorial treatment with antagomiRs against miR-17 and miR-19a dramatically reduce colony forming ability of MLL-fusion containing cells, but not non-MLL AML controls. To determine the mechanism by which these miRNAs contribute to leukemia, we validated PKNOX1 as a target of both miR-17 and miR-19a . MEIS1 and PKNOX1 are TALE domain proteins that participate in ternary complexes with HOX and PBX proteins. Here we establish the competitive relationship between PKNOX1 and MEIS1 in PBX-containing complex formation and determine the antagonistic role of Pknox1 to leukemia in a murine MLL-AF9 model. Collectively, these data implicate the miR-17-92 cluster as part of a regulatory mechanism necessary to maintain MEIS1/HOXA9 -mediated transformation in MLL leukemia. This approach represents a paradigm where targeting multiple non-homologous miRNAs may be utilized as a novel therapeutic regimen. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
