    "abstract_text": "Context: In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the recently described FLT-3 and NPM1 genes abnormalities were found to have a prognostic value in AML with normal karyotype and a specific therapeutic strategy was proposed according to these abnormalities. We look for the incidence and prognostic value of these abnormalities in cases diagnosed on a well defined population. Material and Methods: AML diagnosed according to WHO classification between 01/01/2001 and 31/12/2006 in the population of the Co\u0302te d\u2019Or department, were included. Karyotype analyses were performed in 81% of the cases. The FLT3 D835 mutation, the FLT3 internal duplication (ITD) and the NPM1 mutation were systematically studied on the biological material of the diagnosis cryopreserved in the Ferdinand Cabanne Biobank of Burgundy, by PCR and DNA sequencing techniques. The vital status of the patients was update on 31/10/2007. The relative survival was calculated with the STATA (V9) software. Results: 100 de novo AML and 47 secondary AML (sAML) were registered (72 females and 75 males). The world standardized incidence rate was 2.4 in men and 1.5 in women for de novo AML instead of what it was respectively of 1.1 and 0.6 in sAML. The urban predominance was present in both type of AML. The karyotype was normal in 38% (45/119) of cases (35% of de novo AML and 21% of sAML). It was abnormal in 62% of cases (74/119)(51% of de novo AML and 49% of sAML). Molecular analyses were performed in 78 de novo AML and in 24 sAML. FLT3 ITD was present in 19% (15/78) de novo AMl and in any sAML. The FLT3 D835 mutation was present in 6.5% of de novo AML and in 8% of sAML. NPM1 was mutated respectively in 26% and 4% of the cases. There was a significantly higher WBC count and proportion of blast cells in peripheral blood in FLT3 ITD cases. Overall and relative survivals of FLT3 ITD cases were decreased compared to FLT3 wild type cases. No difference according to NPM1 status was found. Conclusions: These data confirm the bad prognostic value of FLT3 ITD status in AML observed in clinical series. Furthermore their particular interest lies in the fact that they are the first molecular data in AML produced on a population-based series indicating the feasibility of such epidemiological studies.",
