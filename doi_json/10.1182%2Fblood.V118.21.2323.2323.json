    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2323 Platelet transfusion is therapeutically important for patients with thrombocytopenia and/or bleeding disorders. Problems associated with a lack of donors and unknown infections in the blood have not been fully resolved, however. In that context, human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are a potentially abundant source of infection-free platelets. The pluripotent state of hiPSCs and their differentiation depend upon appropriate culture conditions defined in part by oxygen and temperature. We therefore initially examined whether temperatures at or below 24\u00b0C, which are required for preservation of platelet concentrates ex vivo , allow hiPSC differentiation to generate platelets. We found that only at 37\u00b0C were platelets generated. But at 37\u00b0C in vitro , platelets are subject to degradation exemplified by the shedding of GPIb\u03b1, a receptor for von Willebrand factor (vWF), which is caused by a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 17. We therefore developed KP-457, a novel ADAM17 inhibitor that has a reverse hydroxamic acid structure and has been found safe in rats and dogs. Although inhibition of p38 MAP kinase, putatively upstream of ADAM17, reportedly inhibits GPIb\u03b1 shedding in stored human platelets, even at 37\u00b0C, administration of the p38 inhibitor SB203580 induces cytotoxicity during differentiation, leading to a loss of platelet yield from hiPSCs. By contrast, KP-457 significantly protected GPIb\u03b1 expression in platelets from hiPSCs and in aged human platelets in culture at 37\u00b0C. Moreover, iPSC-derived platelets generated in the presence of KP-457 displayed improved hemostatic function when studied using an imaging system that enables characterization of single-platelet kinetics during thrombus formation after laser-induced injury in vivo . We propose this new drug could markedly improve the maintenance of functional platelets generated in culture, particularly those derived from hiPSCs.
