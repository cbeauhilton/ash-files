    "abstract_text": "For decades, it has remained challenging to achieve long-term engraftment and correction of blood counts using gene-modified hematopoietic stem cells for Fanconi anemia. Toward this goal, our group conducted preclinical studies using a safety modified lentiviral vector encoding full-length cDNA for FANCA in normal and affected patient hematopoietic progenitor cells, and in a mutant mouse model that supported the IND for a gene therapy clinical trial for Fanconi anemia, complementation group A (NCT01331018). These studies led us to incorporate methods such as addition of N-acetylcysteine and hypoxic incubation during transduction. Because of the low stem cell numbers of Fanconi patients and initial difficulty with using plerixafor off-label for mobilization, we began our study with bone marrow as the source of stem cells. Due to concerns regarding secondary cancers, no conditioning was administered prior to infusion of gene-modified cells. The US Food and Drug Administration approved adult patients initially, but later permitted pediatric patient enrollment with a minimum age of 4 years. The primary objective of our phase I trial was safety. Secondary objectives included in vitro correction of mitomycin C (MMC) sensitivity, procurement of sufficient cell numbers, and ultimately, long-term correction of blood counts in recipients. Eligibility included absolute neutrophil count \u22650.5, hemoglobin \u22658, platelet count \u226520,000, lack of matched family donor, adequate organ function, and not meeting criteria for diagnosis of MDS. Our three enrolled patients were ages 22, 10, and 5 years. All demonstrated defects in the FANCA gene, with two patients sequenced and one patient diagnosed by complementation. Due to in-process learning and the later addition of plerixafor mobilization to the protocol, three different laboratory procedures were used to prepare the gene-modified product for each patient. Cell products were CD34+ selected bone marrow, bone marrow mononuclear cells depleted of red cells by hetastarch, and G-CSF and plerixafor mobilized cells depleted of red blood cells and cells bearing lineage markers, respectively. Transduction efficiencies were 17.7, 42.7 and 26.3% of colony forming cells (CFC) in 0 nM MMC, and 80, 100, and 100% of CFC in 10 nM MMC. Growth of hematopoietic colonies in MMC indicated functional correction of the FANCA defect. The 1st patient received 6.1\u00d710e4, the 2nd 2.9\u00d710e5, and the 3rd 4.3\u00d710e6 CD34+ cells/kg. Serious adverse events included cytopenias in all patients, and hospital admission for fever due to viral upper respiratory infection in one patient. The patients remain alive at 46, 38, and 12 months after receipt of gene-modified cells. Due to worsening cytopenias, the third patient underwent hematopoietic cell transplant from an unrelated donor 10 months after infusion of gene-modified cells. To date, he has done well with transplant, and no indication that prior gene therapy impacted the outcome. The blood counts for the first 2 patients who have not undergone allogeneic transplant remain stable at 1,111 and 1,077 days post infusion compared to the first blood counts when they arrived at our center. For the 1st patient, vector was detectable in white blood cells (WBC) up to 21 days, in the 2nd up to 582 days, and the 3rd up to 81 days post infusion. Thus, in these patients, despite dramatic improvement in cell dose during the study, there was lack of persistence in detection of gene-modified WBCs beyond 1.5 years. A number of factors may have contributed, including lack of conditioning, in vitro cell manipulation including cytokine exposure, inability to transduce primitive hematopoietic stem cells, and paucity of long-term repopulating cells at the ages of the patients, suggesting earlier collection may be beneficial. This study is now closed to enrollment. Valuable information gained as a result of this study will contribute to future clinical gene therapy trials. Current work focuses on how to evaluate stem cell fitness prior to attempting gene therapy, minimizing manipulation required for gene correction and/or in vivo genetic correction and non-chemotherapy-based conditioning to facilitate engraftment. We would like to personally thank each patient and their families for participating in this study, as we could not have learned these lessons without their support.
