    "abstract_text": "Abstract 120 The transcription factor Sp1 transactivates expression of genes containing proximal GC/GT-rich promoter elements controlling cell differentiation, cell cycle and apoptosis affecting growth and survival of tumor cells. Based on previous observation that key multiple myeloma (MM) cell growth and survival genes such as NF-kB p65, IGF-IR, VEGF, and IL-6 are controlled by Sp proteins, we have previously investigated and observed high Sp1 expression and activity in MM cells and confirmed its role in MM by Sp1 knock down using both siRNA and lentiviral shRNA constructs specific for Sp1. We further evaluated the role of Sp-1 in WM and observed high nuclear Sp1 protein expression along with increased Sp1 activity in WM cells compared to normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Moreover, adhesion of WM cells to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) further induces Sp1 activity in WM cells. Based on these data, we have investigated the anti-WM activity of Terameprocol (TMP), a small molecule suitable for clinical application,which specifically competes with Sp1-specific DNA binding domains within gene promoter regions. It disrupts the interaction between Sp1 and GC-rich motifs inhibiting Sp1 activity without direct effect on its expression. We have confirmed inhibition of both basal and BMSC-induced binding and transcriptional activity of Sp1 in WM cells using an ELISA assay specific for measuring Sp1 binding activity and using Sp1 sensitive luciferase reporter plasmid. TMP treatment did not affect Sp1 protein levels. Importantly, TMP significantly inhibited WM cell growth in a dose-dependent fashion (IC50 between 5\u201320 \u03bc M at 24 hours) and was able to overcome the protective effects of BMSCs. TMP activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway via induction of caspase-3, -9 and -7 and PARP cleavage but without caspase-8 activation. TMP treatment also led to downregulation of expression of survivin, a known anti-apoptotic gene transcriptionally regulated by Sp1. We have also confirmed in vivo activity of TMP in a murine xenograft model of MM. Finally based on the data suggesting that both dexamethasone and revlimid increase Sp1 activity, we have combined TMP with these agents and observed synergistic activity on cell growth and survival. In conclusion, our results demonstrate Sp1 as an important transcription factor in WM and provides preclinical rationale for clinical development of TMP as a specific Sp1 inhibitor alone and in combination with conventional and novel agents in WM.
