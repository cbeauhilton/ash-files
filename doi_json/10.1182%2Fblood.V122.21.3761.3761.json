    "abstract_text": "While mutations of splicing and epigenetic factors have been reported in adult AML and related myeloid disorders, relatively few such changes have been identified in pediatric AML. We previously identified a chromatin remodeling helicase, PASG ( SMARCA6 , HELLS , LSH ), by down-regulation in AML cell lines following cytokine withdrawal and identified an alternatively spliced variant lacking a highly conserved (STRAGGLG) domain. To assess the prevalence of this splicing variant ( PASG \u039475) in pediatric AML, we tested 167 diagnostic specimens from the TARGET-AML cohort for fractional PASG \u039475 expression ( PASG \u039475 /PASG) using a discriminatory RT-qPCR assay. These studies demonstrated a broad, continuous distribution of PASG \u039475 with right skew (mean PASG \u039475: 26%, interquartile range: 9% \u2013 41%) that was not significantly associated with cytogenetic class (inv16, t(8;21), MLL, normal) or FAB subtype. For further comparison, specimens were quantized by PASG \u039475 quartile. Given reported associations between loss of PASG function and abnormalities of genomic methylation, we tested 48 AML specimens at the extremes of the PASG \u039475 distribution for total 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) content by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The mean total methylation was significantly lower in the high compared to the low PASG \u039475 groups (mean 5-mC 3.95% vs. 4.22% of cytosine, p=0.015 Mann-Whitney). To identify specific regions of altered methylation, we used high-throughput sequencing of DNA enriched by pull-down with the methyl binding domain fragment of MBD2 (MBD-Seq). Comparison of summed methylation signal across regions flanking RefSeq transcriptional start sites (TSS) showed the expected decrease in methylation just upstream of the TSS in both groups. However, methylation more distal to the TSS was proportionally lower in PASG \u039475 high than PASG \u039475 low samples ( Fig 1a ). To evaluate methylation at CpG islands (CGI), UCSC CGI were scaled to 500 bp and MBD-Seq data were summed across 20Kb flanking CGI. While both groups showed the anticipated increase in methylation signal on CGI, methylation in the shore regions immediately flanking CGI was proportionally lower in high PASG \u039475 compared to low PASG \u039475 samples ( Fig 1b ), further suggesting epigenetic differences between these sample groups.

We evaluated gene expression patterns on the Affymetrix HuGene array, with assessment of alternative splicing using Partek software alternative splicing (altsplice) algorithm for quartile-grouped samples. In contrast to comparison of adjacent quartile groups, which showed modest changes in expression and relatively few transcripts with significant altsplice scores, comparison of the highest and lowest quartile samples showed marked changes in gene expression and a large number of alternatively spiced transcripts as assessed by significance of the altsplice score ( Fig 2 ). In addition to splicing changes, these analyses suggested marked differences in gene expression patterns of AML specimens grouped by PASG \u039475 quartile, with clear separation of Q1 and Q4 samples by principal components analysis. Using a conservative Wilcoxon gene sets test and limiting ourselves to small, curated Biocarta pathways, we found expression patterns associated with high deletion variant expression strongly linked to overlapping pathways involving DNA repair, replication, and cell cycle progression.
