    "abstract_text": "Rituximab (chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) has been reported to be effective in various autoimmune conditions, especially in autoimmune cytopenias, but there are few reports of its use in paediatric population with underlying immunodeficiency states. We report three cases of autoimmune cytopenias (Evan\u2019s syndrome in DiGeorge syndrome, autoimmune thrombocytopenia in a HIV positive patient and lastly autoimmune thrombocytopenia in a post liver transplant patient) where rituximab was effective in reversing the cytopenias. First patient (11yrs) had DiGeorge syndrome which was complicated by Evan\u2019s syndrome. It was treated with multiple courses of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, with resultant recurrent systemic bacterial and fungal infections. She had rituximab as a last resort, which resulted in sustained improvements in her Haemoglobin and platelet count. Second patient (12yrs) was diagnosed with HIV in 1993. She had sudden onset Intra-cranial bleed as a result of immune thrombocytopenia. She was treated with Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and subsequently with prednisolone with no response. She however responded to rituximab and then went on to have rituximab for a further 2 courses, each 12 months apart. The third patient (14yrs) had auxiliary liver transplant in 2002. He developed immune thrombocytopenia and neutropenia in which remission was sustained only for a maximum of 6 weeks following IVIg. As he was already on immunosuppression, he was given rituximab to which he has had a sustained remission. Side effects: The patient with DiGeorge syndrome had recurrent chest infection which was thought to be due to aspiration as a result of her hiatus hernia. The other patients did not have major side-effects. Immunoglobulin levels in all three patients were in normal range. Thus, in our experience rituximab is a useful adjunct in management of autoimmune cytopenias with an underlying immunodeficiency state and should be considered early in steroid refractory cases, as it leads to sustained remissions in the blood counts. It is well tolerated without major infections in patients who are already immunosuppressed due to their immunodeficiency state and the fear of immuneparesis is not seen."
