    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1028 The two committed erythroid progenitor populations that have been functionally defined by colony assays are burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) and colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E). While significant progress has been made in defining these two progenitor populations in the murine system, their characterization in the human system is incomplete. To address this issue, we have characterized the dynamic changes in surface expression levels of number of proteins including CD34, c-kit, IL-3R, CD36, CD71, GPA and CD45 during proliferation of purified human CD34 + cells from cord blood during the first phase of the two-phase in vitro erythroid culture system. In the presence of stem cell factor, IL-3 and erythropoietin during this phase, CD34 + cells differentiate first into BFU-E and then into CFU-E during 7 days of culture with peak levels of BFU-E at day 4 and of CFU-E at day 6. During this period of time, the expression levels of CD34 and IL-3R decreased, while that that of CD36 and CD71 increased. CD45 was expressed during the entire 7 day culture period while there was no expression of GPA. Based on these findings, we sorted pure populations of CD34 + CD36 \u2212 IL3-R + and CD34 \u2212 CD36 + IL-3R \u2212 cells and characterized their behavior in colony forming assays. The sorted CD34 + CD36 \u2212 IL3-R + population gave rise to BFU-E colonies while CD34 \u2212 CD36 + IL-3R \u2212 population gave rise CFU-E colonies, both at a purity of over 80%. The identity of the sorted BFU-E and CFU-E cells was further supported by their differential responsiveness to dexamethasone and lenalidomide (Narla A et al Blood 2011), with increased proliferation BFU-E population by dexamethasone and increased proliferation of CFU-E by lenalidomide. These findings were further validated by isolation of pure populations of BFU-E and CFU-E from primary human bone marrow based on the identified markers. The ability to isolate pure populations of human BFU-E and CFU-E progenitors should enable detailed molecular and cellular characterization of these distinct erythroid progenitor populations. Furthermore, enumeration of the number of these progenitor populations in human bone marrow may help in delineating mechanisms of disordered erythropoiesis in various disorders such as bone marrow failure syndromes.
