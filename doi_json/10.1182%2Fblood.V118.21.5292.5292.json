    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5292 Objective: Repeated blood transfusion my lead to peroxidative tissue injury in thalassemia ptients due to secondary iron overload. The aim of the study was to assess the effects of antioxidant vitamins on the oxidative stress, antioxidant status, erythrocytes, hemoglobin derivatives. Also to demonstrate their effects on hepatic status in multitransfused beta-thalassemia major patients. Methods: The study was a prospective follow up study. It involved thirty \u03b2-thalassemia major patients aged 4\u201317 years (15 males and 15 females) recruited from Hematology Oncology Department, Ain Shams University. They were compared to a 20 healthy age and sex matched subjects served as controls. Patients were treated with oral dose of vitamin E (400 mg/day if patient weight < 20 kg and 600 mg/day in patient weight at least 20 kg), low dose of vitamin C (100 mg/day) and vitamin A (25000 IU/ week) for twelve months. Investigations were performed before and after 6 and twelve months of therapy: liver transaminases, serum ferrittin, hepatitis status for HBV, HCV, hepatic fibroscan elastography (TE) for assessment of liver fibrosis and hepatic MRI R2* to measure liver iron concentration (LIC). Assessment of the oxidant /antioxidant capacity by measuring: reduced glutathione, malondialdehyde, ascorbic acid, catalase enzyme, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase as well as glutathione peroxidase determination. Results: All patients were on iron chelation therapy: 12 patients received deferiprone (DFP) (75 mg/kg per day orally), 8 patients received deferoxamine (DFO) (30\u201350 mg/kg per day subcutaneously at least 5 times/week), and 10 patients received a combination of DFO (30\u201350 mg/kg per day, 2\u20133 days/week) and DFP (75 mg/kg per day, 7 days/week). In the studied thalassemics 40.0% and 54% were HCV RNA and hepatitis B surface antigen positive. The basal levels of vitamin A, E and C were 3.1, 4, and 2.6 times significantly lower in thalassemia patients compared to controls(p12kPa) at baseline compared to 16% after 12 ms therapy (P=0.04).And 56% of patients had value of (>6kPa) at baseline compared to 66%, 70% at 6 and 12months therapy respectively(p=0.03). Levels of liver iron concentration were progressively decreased during the study period compared to baseline (22.4\u00b16.7, 19.4\u00b14.8, 14.4\u00b13.6 mg/gm) in MRI R2* at baseline, after 6 and 12 months therapy respectively<0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Antioxidants vitamins are effective in clinical practice for regulation of antioxidant status as well as improvement of liver iron concentration and hepatic fibrosis in multitransfused thalassemia major patients.
