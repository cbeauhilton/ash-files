    "abstract_text": "Purpose: To describe the response rates and time to treatment failure in patients with chronic refractory ITP treated with Rituximab. Methods: Fourteen consecutive patients with chronic refractory ITP, who didn\u2019t achieve a response to first- and second-line treatments (including splenectomy), were recruited between November 2001 and May 2004. Rituximab was administered at 375 mg/m 2 iv weekly\u2019 4 and all patients were pre-medicated with Diphenhydramine (30 mg single dose) and Hydrocortisone (100 mg IV single dose). The first response assessment was performed at week 4, using the following criteria: complete response, platelet count > 100 x 10 9 /L; partial response, platelet count > 50 x 10 9 /L; minimal response , platelet count persisted below 50 x 10 9 /L but without bleeding or need for platelet transfusion; and no response if the platelet count did not change, or the patients required platelet transfusion or remained symptomatic. The response was considered sustained if it persisted for at least 6 months. Results: The age range was 17\u201370 years; the baseline platelet count range was 3\u201337 x 10 9 /L. Five patients achieved a complete response, four patients a partial response, four a minimal response and one no response. The time to response was from 4\u201332 weeks and 10 patients showed a sustained response. No patients with a response showed bleeding and no patients required the use of other drugs. Conclusions: These results suggest that Rituximab should have a significant therapeutic effect and an acceptable safety profile in patients with refractory chronic ITP. However, there is a lack of randomized, prospective studies to demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of this treatment.",
