    "abstract_text": "This multicenter, open-label study evaluated the safe, effective dose of intravenous argatroban for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in patients \u226416 years of age requiring nonheparin anticoagulation. The protocol-specified argatroban dose for systemic anticoagulation was 1.0 \u03bcg/kg/min (0.25 \u03bcg/kg/min for patients with impaired hepatic function; 0.5 \u03bcg/kg/min for patients 2.0 mg/dL secondary to hepatic impairment or cardiac complications. Of 11 patients administered 1.0 \u03bcg/kg/min initially, target aPTTs were achieved without dose adjustment in 4 patients by 2 h and with no or little dose adjustment in 8 patients by 9 h and all patients by 26 h. Within the 30-day follow up, 5 patients had 6 thrombotic events (2 patients had an event during therapy). No patient required amputation or died due to thrombosis during therapy. In each patient with confirmed HIT, the platelet count recovered during treatment. Two critically ill patients had major bleeding (each event was fatal): 1 patient died 2 days after argatroban cessation due to cerebral infarction and intracranial hemorrhage, and 1 patient on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for heart failure had fatal subarachnoid bleeding on study day 25. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events were hypokalemia, constipation and hypotension (n=5, each). In this first prospective study of direct thrombin inhibition in both infants and children requiring nonheparin anticoagulation, argatroban was well tolerated and rapidly provided adequate levels of anticoagulation for noninterventional or interventional needs in seriously ill pediatric patients.",
