    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5101 We report a 23 yr female patient which relates beginning of current illness three months prior diagnosis; characterized with increased abdominal volume, concomitant active hemorrhagic manifestations consisting of ecchymosis and petechiae. Upon clinical, bone marrow biopsy, immunohistochemistry and subsequent surgery, case corresponded to Diffuse Large B-Cells Lymphoma(DLBCL) of splenic intravascular origin. Organ weight and size after splenectomy 2.53 Kg size 30\u00d722\u00d710 cm). Microscopic diagnosis description corresponds with presence of monomorphic lymphoid cells with predominance of small neoplasic lymphoid cells with small round nucleus, granular chromatin and small nucleolus accompanied with eventual cytoplasmic membrane irregularities. Presence of reactive plasmocytes and sever splenic congestion. The unusual case reported corresponds to an invasive lymphoma of splenic vascular origin. By our knowledge this is the first case register in Venezuela. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
