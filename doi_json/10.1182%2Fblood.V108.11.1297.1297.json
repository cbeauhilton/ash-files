    "abstract_text": "Primary familial and congenital polycythemia (PFCP) is a rare inherited disorder presenting with elevated red blood cell mass, elevated hemoglobin concentration and low levels of erythropoietin. Ten mutations in the erythropoietin receptor ( EPOR ) gene to date have been associated with PFCP. All of these mutations result in deletion of 59 to 82 amino acids from the carboxy terminal of EpoR which has been shown to contain a negative regulatory domain. Here, we describe a 2-year old boy of French-Canadian descent presenting with polycythemia and splenomegaly. Sequencing of the EPOR gene showed the proband to be heterozygous for a G to A transition in nucleotide 6002 (G6002A). The mutation generates a stop codon instead of tryptophan at amino acid 439, leading to a truncated EpoR. The association of the G6002A mutation in the EPOR gene with PFCP has been previously described in a large Finnish family ( dela Chapelle et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA  1993 ; 90 : 4495 ) and in a 16-year old boy of English descent ( Percy et al., Br J Hematol  1998 ; 100 : 407 ). The G6002A mutation in both cases was considered to have arisen independently based on differences in a microsatellite polymorphism in the 5\u2032UT of EPOR and the absence of the mutation in the immediate family of the English boy. We studied our proband\u2019s parents for the G6002A EPOR mutation and did not find it. Their parentage was confirmed using 24 different microsatellite markers. This indicates that the G6002A mutation in the proband arose de novo . Since the mutation arose de novo , in vitro methycellulose cultures of erythroid progenitors isolated from peripheral blood of the proband were grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of Epo to rule out genetic mosaicism. The erythroid progenitors showed hypersensitivity to Epo as is characteristic of PFCP. However, we did not find evidence supportive of genetic mosaicism as all 70 BFU-E colonies analyzed were heterozygous for the G6002A mutation. Previously, two other polycythemia-associated EPOR mutations, 5974insG ( Sokol et al., Blood  1995 ; 86 : 15 ) and 5959 G>T ( Kralovics et al., Am J Hematol  2001 ; 68 : 115 ) were shown to have arisen de novo . This case is thus the fourth instance out of 13 reported cases of polycythemia-associated EPOR mutations that has arisen de novo . Because of the rarity of polycythemia-associated EPOR mutations, their frequent de novo occurrence suggests that these mutations do not have a selective advantage but are detrimental. Their possible association with increased risk of thromboembolic and atherosclerotic disease due to chronically augmented Epo signaling is being explored by ongoing clinical studies."
