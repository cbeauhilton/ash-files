    "abstract_text": "Children with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome, DS) are predisposed to develop acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (DS-AMKL) as well as the antecedent transient leukemia (DS-TL). Mutations in the transcription factor GATA1 -leading to the exclusive expression of the shorter GATA1 isoform (GATA1s)- are present in nearly all children with DS-AMKL and DS-TL. GATA1s is both essential and sufficient to cause DS-TL in synergy with trisomy 21. To elucidate how the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 (hsa21) perturbs fetal hematopoiesis to provide a GATA1s-sensitive background during trisomy 21-associated leukemogenesis, we integrated an RNAi viability screening (512 shRNAmirs against 210 genes on hsa21) and a proteomics approach creating an hsa21 oncogenic network centered on GATA1s. shRNA-mediated knock-down of 42 genes conferred a profound selective growth disadvantage in DS-AMKL cell lines (CMK and CMY). A secondary functional validation screening confirmed 8 genes to specifically affect proliferation, cell viability, apoptosis or differentiation in GATA1s/trisomy-associated leukemia; whereas expression of 9 genes was also essential for proliferation and survival of erythroleukemia (K562) and non-DS-AMKL (M07) cell lines. Gain- and loss-of-function studies of 12 selected candidates (8 GATA1s/trisomy-specific oncogenes plus 4 global oncogenes) in CD34 + hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) uncovered their regulatory function during megakaryopoiesis, erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis. Knockdown of four genes ( USP25, BACH1, U2AF1 and C21orf33 ) inhibited megakaryocytic and erythroid in vitro differentiation, while enhancing myeloid differentiation. Inversely, ectopic expression of six genes ( C21orf33 , CHAF1B , IFNGR2 , WDR4, RUNX1 or GABPA ) resulted in a switch from erythroid to megakaryocytic differentiation. These 12 candidate genes acted synergistically to enhance the self-renewal efficiency of murine fetal liver cells in vitro . Pooled transduction of these genes increased the replating efficiency (more than 5 rounds) of fetal liver HSPCs whereas the colony-forming capacity was lost after second replating in the empty vector control. Further, 9 out of 12 candidate genes were overexpressed in DS-AMKL patient samples (n=23) compared to non-DS-AMKL (n=37; 1.3-fold to 2-fold) underscoring their relevance for the pathogenesis of DS-AMKL. Using an in vivo biotinylation approach to study the protein-protein interaction in DS-AMKL cells, we showed that bio GATA1 is associated with protein-complexes of 10 different hsa21-oncogenes, which are involved in splicing, deubiquitination and transcriptional regulation. Direct interactions with several of these factors are perturbed in N-terminal truncated GATA1s. Thus, we deciphered a complex interactive network on hsa21 around GATA1 positively regulating megakaryopoiesis. Deregulation of this network results in synergistic effects on hematopoietic differentiation, which can promote transformation of GATA1s-mutated fetal hematopoietic progenitor cells.
