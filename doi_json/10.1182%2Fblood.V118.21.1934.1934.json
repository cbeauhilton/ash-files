    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1934 Introduction: GCSF (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor) with or without chemotherapy have been mainstays of mobilization protocols. Although effective, plerixafor is very expensive and adds significantly to the cost of stem cell collection. There is a body of literature indicating that nicotine exposure induces mobilization of endothelial stem cells. Additionally, nicotine-induced alterations in hematopoietic stem cell kinetics have also been described in both humans and animal models. A chance observation of a better than expected stem cell collection in a smoking patient prompted us to review our databases and determine if nicotine patch use or smoking had an effect on the success of stem cell collections. Methods: Data was retrospectively retrieved from a local transplant database and the electronic medical records of all male patients with a diagnosis of plasma cell myeloma who had peripheral stem cells collected using GCSF-mediated mobilization at our facility from 2003-June 2009. Data on smoking and the use of a nicotine patch at the time of mobilization, diagnosis, stage of disease, age, days of collection, number of stem cells collected at day 1 and total, previous chemotherapy/radiation therapy and prior response to therapy were collected. Patients who received chemotherapy or plerixafor for mobilization were excluded from the study. If patients had more than one mobilization/collection procedure, only data from the first was analyzed. Smoking/nicotine exposure was determined by review of the medical record and pharmacy prescription logs. Results: A total of 137 patients with average age of 58.7 \u00b1 7.4 who had undergone stem cell mobilization and collection were identified of whom 13 (9.5%) were determined to have an exposure to nicotine during that time ( table 1 ). Of the 13 patients, one was actively smoking and twelve were using a nicotine patch. Simple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between day 1 CD34 progenitor cell collection of > 4 million/kg and clinical variables (nicotine exposure, prior alkylating agent, prior radiation therapy, response at transplant, lenalidomide use and Durie-Salmon stage). Nicotine exposure had a significant favorable effect, with p-value=0.0349 ( table 2 ). Further analysis with a multiple logistic regression model indicates that nicotine use was associated with a 3.5 fold favorable odds ratio for the success of stem cell collection \u2265 4 million/kg with adjusting for age, p-value 0.039 ( table 3 ).

The small sample size makes drawing definitive conclusions difficult, but point to the need for an examination of larger databases to determine if this relationship has validity.
