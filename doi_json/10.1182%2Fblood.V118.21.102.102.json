    "abstract_text": "Abstract 102 Background: Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) has proven to be highly active in relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) and the best single agent efficacy results in frontline therapy of FL were obtained with Iodine-131 Tositumomab (Bexxar\u2122) (Kaminski et al NEJM 2005); albeit half of the patients had low tumor burden. In patients with higher tumor burden, using more than one fraction of RIT increases the overall radiation dose over that of a single fraction of treatment, thereby potentially improving both the response rates and survival (Illidge et al, Blood 2009). Methods: We conducted an international, multicenter phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of Fractionated 90 Y Ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin\u2122) RIT as an initial therapy of Follicular Lymphoma. Eligible patients had untreated follicular lymphoma (grade 1, 2, or 3a) and at least one criterion of high tumour burden - one lymphoma lesion greater than 7 cm or three separate nodes of 3 cm or more; symptomatic splenic enlargement; raised serum concentrations of either lactate dehydrogenase or \u03b22-microglobulin; compressive syndrome; or the presence of B symptoms. Treatment consisted of two doses of 90 Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (11.1 MBq/kg) given 8\u201312 weeks apart. Patients with greater than 20% bone marrow involvement (BM) with lymphoma received 4 weekly infusions Rituximab (375 mg/m 2 ) and proceeded to fractionated RIT only if a repeat BM biopsy demonstrated clearing of lymphoma with less than or equal to 20% involvement. The primary endpoint was end of treatment response (EOR) of the intent-to-treat (ITT) population according to IWC 1999, assessed 12 weeks after last 90 Y Ibritumomab tiuxetan infusion (21 weeks after treatment start). Secondary objectives were safety and progression free survival (PFS). Results: 74 patients with a median age of 61 years (28\u221280), including 58 (78%) with stage III\u2013IV stage, 23 (31%) intermediate risk FLIPI 2 and 34 (46%) with high risk FLIPI 3\u20135; were included between June 2007 and June 2010 in 7 centres. Thirteen (18%) patients with >20% BM involvement required rituximab pre-treatment, 2/74 did not qualify for RIT, meaning 72 received the first 90 Y Ibritumomab tiuxetan infusion and 55 (76%) completed the full treatment schedule. The 2 nd infusion of RIT was withheld secondary to hematologic toxicity with 1 st infusion (n=12, 17%) or human anti murine antibodies positive testing (n = 4; 5.6%) or other (n = 1, 1.4%). Two out of 72 patients did not have recorded response data and the EOR was 95.7% (67/70) with CR/CRu of 57.1% (40/71). Six patients subsequently improved response making an ORR of 97.1% (68/70) (95% CI 90.0% \u2013 99.7%), and CR/CRu of 64.3%% (45/70) (95% CI 51.9% \u2013 75.4%). For the subset of 17 patients who only received a single 90 Y Ibritumomab tiuxetan infusion, ORR (CR/CRu) was 100% (76,5%). At a median follow-up of 1.52 years (range 0.13 \u2013 3.69 years) the PFS is 67 %, 20 patients have progressed and 12 of these have required further treatment (8 chemotherapy, 2 radiotherapy, 2 other). Updated data with median follow-up of more than 2 years will be presented. Ten patients experienced at least one SAE during the treatment period, with 3 related to study treatment (one case of rigors associated with the first infusion of rituximab and 2 cases of neutropenic sepsis both associated with the second RIT dose. The most common toxicity was hematologic: after the first 90 Y Ibritumomab tiuxetan dose, related G3-4 hematological AEs were transient neutropenia (20.8%, 18 days median duration) and thrombocytopenia (20.8%; 20 days median duration). After the second 90 Y Ibritumomab tiuxetan dose, related G3-4 hematological AEs increased to 36.4% for neutropenia (31days median duration), 14% for anemia (8/55 required transfusion) and 56.4% for thrombocytopenia (40 days median duration). There has been one case of MDS diagnosed 26 months after treatment and one death due to metastatic breast cancer diagnosed 9 months post last dose of 90 Y Ibritumomab tiuxetan Conclusion: Fractionated RIT using 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan is an effective frontline treatment of advanced-stage follicular lymphoma in patients with high tumor burden requiring treatment and delivers high response rates. The treatment was well tolerated by patients with few infectious episodes and AE's and manageable hematologic toxicity.
