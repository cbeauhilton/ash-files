    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4082 N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) is considered an inert drug delivery vehicle that is widely used as an industrial organic solvent. NMP is found in a range of pharmaceutical preparations and bio-prosthetic cements. In particular, NMP is used to solubilize kinase inhibitors for pre-clinical testing in experimental mice. The Vk*MYC transgenic mouse is a model of multiple myeloma (MM) that recapitulates the human disease. We have adapted Vk*MYC MM using a syngeneic transplant approach to shorten latency and facilitate testing of novel therapeutics. In this model, we noted delayed disease progression and improved survival in NMP treated mice compared to alternative vehicle controls. To confirm this observation, matched cohorts of mice bearing monoclonal kappa-secreting MM were treated with 20% NMP/80% polyethylene glycol (PEG) ( n = 13), PEG alone ( n = 10) or PBS ( n = 7) at 100uL per 20g mouse daily p.o. Mice were monitored by serial serum protein electrophoresis and quantitative kappa immunoglobulin (IgK) estimation. At the commencement of therapy, cohorts were well matched for disease burden; mean M-spikes 12%, 14% and 14% of total serum protein for NMP, PBS and PEG respectively (p=0.58 NMP vs. PBS, p=0.68 NMP vs. PEG). After 28d treatment, NMP-treated mice had lower paraproteinemia compared to PBS and PEG controls (mean M-spike NMP 31%, PBS 42% and PEG 40%; p < 0.05 NMP vs. PBS or PEG), with concordant suppression of IgK (NMP 18g/L vs. PBS 39g/L, p<0.05). Survival in NMP-treated mice was also significantly longer than that in PBS-treated controls (median survival 50d and 40d respectively; p<0.05 log rank). Survival of PEG-only treated mice did not differ from PBS controls (median survival 39.5d; p=0.49). We compared the structure of NMP to known MM therapeutics, revealing that NMP is a subunit of thalidomide and its analogues. We next tested NMP for cytotoxicity and immune-modulatory drug (IMiD) activity in vitro. NMP (1uM \u2013 10mM) was not directly cytotoxic to healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or the U266 myeloma cell line. However, treatment of PBMC with 10uM NMP significantly enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity against the NK cell-sensitive target cell line K562 from 26% to 42% (p < 0.05). Further, NMP favored a Th-1 cytokine profile without directly altering the frequency of CD4, CD8, NK or regulatory T cell subsets in vitro . As compared to the IMiD lenalidomide, NMP inhibited TNF-a production from LPS stimulated monocytes. Given the IMiD-like effects of NMP, we assessed its ability to alter the expression of NK cell ligands on myeloma targets. NMP upregulated both NKG2D and DNAM-1 ligands (MIC-A, MIC-B, ULBP-1, ULBP-2 and CD155) on U266 cells, thereby enhancing the NK cell mediated lysis of the U266 cell line. Our results demonstrate the in vivo anti-myeloma activity and IMiD-like properties of NMP, indicating that it is a putative active thalidomide subunit. The detection of IMiD-like activity was facilitated by a sensitive, immune competent MM model. NMP should no longer be considered inert for the purposes of drug delivery. These findings mandate re-evaluation of drug efficacy data where NMP has been used as the drug delivery vehicle, particularly in immune-competent cancer models. Our findings with NMP may allow the development of new IMiDs. Finally, occupational or iatrogenic exposure to NMP should be further assessed as a potential risk for immunologically mediated adverse effects.
