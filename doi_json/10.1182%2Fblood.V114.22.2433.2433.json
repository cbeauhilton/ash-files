    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2433 Poster Board II-410 We previously developed robust methods to purify human hematopoietic progenitors based on their high expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH br cells). These cells are enriched with both short- and long-term NOD/SCID repopulating cells. One early clinical trial suggested that augmenting a conventional cord blood transplant (CBT) with ALDH br cells accelerated both neutrophil and platelet engraftment. We now describe experimental models for these clinical transplants, performed in two immunologically disparate strains of NOD/SCID mice. In the clinical study, pediatric patients first received 80% of an unmanipulated cord blood (CB) graft. 4 hours later they received the ALDH br cells purified from the remaining 20% of the graft. In the experimental model, the mice were divided among three cohorts. Some mice were transplanted with 4,000 purified ALDH br cells, alone. Other mice were transplanted with total CB using a cell dose that contained 4,000 ALDH br cells. In the final group, mice first received the same dose of unmanipulated CB and, after 4 hours, 4,000 purified ALDH br cells were also administered. After 4 weeks, the mice were sacrificed to determine their levels of human hematopoietic chimerism. When these transplants were performed using NOD/SCID-IL2R\u03b3 null (NS\u03b3) mice, the ALDH br cells demonstrated strong short-term engraftment to the bone marrow (12 \u00b1 4.9%; n = 5) that was characterized by human CD19 + B cells and CD33 + myeloid cells. The latter included CD15 + cells that indicate neutrophil engraftment. In addition, the peripheral blood of these mice contained low levels of human CD41 + CD61 + platelets. Unmanipulated CB also engrafted the bone marrow of NS\u03b3 mice (7.4 \u00b1 4.7%; n = 8); however, >95% of the human cells appeared to be mature CD3 + T cells. Engraftment by either B cells or myeloid cells was consistently low to undetectable. Similarly, human platelets were not detected in the peripheral blood. When NS\u03b3 mice were transplanted first with total CB and subsequently with purified ALDH br cells, the level of engraftment to the bone marrow increased >2-fold over what had been observed in mice transplanted with CB alone (18.9 \u00b1 9.3%; n = 10; P = 0.006). However, nearly all of the human cells present within the bone marrow were T cells, as had been observed in animals that received only unmanipulated CB. In addition, human platelets were not observed in the peripheral blood of NS\u03b3 mice that had received both CB and ALDH br cells. When similar transplants were performed using NOD/SCID-\u03b22-microglobulin null (NS\u03b2) mice, the ALDH br cells again demonstrated strong short-term engraftment to the bone marrow (5.6 \u00b1 4.7%; n = 5) that was characterized by human CD19 + B cells and CD33 + myeloid cells. The peripheral blood of these mice also contained low levels of human platelets. In contrast, total CB achieved only very low engraftment to the bone marrow of NS\u03b2 mice (0.32 \u00b1 0.19%; n = 4) and human platelets were not detected in the peripheral blood. However, when NS\u03b2 mice first received total CB which was augmented 4 hours later with purified ALDH br progenitors, the level of human hematopoietic chimerism in the bone marrow increased >10-fold (4.3 \u00b1 1.9%; n = 5), with engraftment of human B cells and myeloid cells. The co-transplanted NS\u03b2 mice also demonstrated low-level engraftment of human platelets in the peripheral blood. Continuing studies will resolve the relative contributions of the ALDH br cells and the unmanipulated CB by using two HLA-matched (6/6), but sex-mismatched, CBs. In total, these studies confirmed that ALDH br progenitors by themselves provided efficient short-term myeloid engraftment in both NOD/SCID strains. This was in contrast to what was observed after transplantation of bulk CB, which by itself did not provide efficient myeloid engraftment in either strain. Finally, in both mouse strains, ALDH br cells altered the outcome of CB transplants. In NS\u03b3 mice, ALDH br progenitors appeared to facilitate either the engraftment or proliferation of mature CB T cells. Most importantly, the studies in NS\u03b2 mice strongly suggested that ALDH br progenitors directly augment short-term myeloid and platelet engraftment by total CB. The latter studies in particular mirror the experience of early clinical CBT studies that use the same strategy. Disclosures: Storms: Aldagen, Inc: Equity Ownership, Patents & Royalties.
