    "abstract_text": "NK cells are innate lymphoid cells that mediate anti-leukemia responses. The ability of MHC-haploidentical NK cells to recognize and eliminate AML blasts have been established in the setting of stem cell transplantation and early phase adoptive NK cell immunotherapy trials. However, the optimal approach to prepare human NK cells for maximal anti-leukemia capacity is unclear. As one form of innate NK cell memory, cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML) NK cells are induced by a brief (16 hour) pre-activation of human NK cells with the combination of IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18, while control NK cells from the same donor are activated by IL-15 only. In published work, this combined IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 pre-activation results in enhanced proliferation and augmented IFN-gamma responses to cytokine or activating receptor-based re-stimulation following a rest period of 1 \u2013 6 weeks. We hypothesized that CIML NK cells exhibit improved anti-leukemia properties compared to control NK cells from the same individual. Purified primary human CIML NK cells [both CD56 bright and CD56 dim subsets] produce more IFN-gamma, compared to control NK cells, upon re-stimulation with K562 cells or primary AML blasts after 7 days of rest (p<0.05 and p<0.001, N=5). CIML NK cells also exhibit higher granzyme B protein expression (p<0.01; N=8), and increased cytotoxicity against K562 leukemia targets in vitro (p<0.001, 2.5:1 and 5:1 E:T ratios). We next established a NOD-SCID-gamma- c -/- (NSG) xenograft model to investigate primary human CIML NK cell responses in vivo, with survival supported by low dose IL-2 administered every other day. Seven days following injection of 4 million NK cells / mouse, human CIML NK cells traffic to the bone marrow, spleen, liver and blood, and exhibited better in vivo expansion and persistence, compared to control NK cells (p=0.05 in the blood and bone marrow). Further, the characteristic enhanced functionality of CIML compared to control NK cells when restimulated with K562 targets was retained when assessed ex vivo 7 days post-transfer (p<0.05). Next, we investigated the ability of CIML versus control NK cells from the same donor to clear K562 AML cells in vivo . First, luciferase expressing K562 cells (1 million / mouse) were engrafted into sub-lethally irradiated (250 cGy) NSG mice. On day 3 after K562 challenge, primary human CIML or control NK cells from the same donor (4 million / mouse) were injected, which were supported in vivo using low dose IL-2. CIML NK cells exhibited significantly improved in vivo leukemia clearance as evidenced by whole mouse bioluminescence imaging (see Figure, P=0.03, N=7 mice per group). Thus, human CIML NK cells exhibit enhanced in vitro and in vivo anti-leukemia effects, compared to control NK cells. Based on these findings, a first-in-human phase 1 study of CIML NK cells in relapsed/refractory AML is currently underway.
