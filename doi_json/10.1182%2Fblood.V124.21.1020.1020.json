    "abstract_text": "Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characterized by the formation of a PML-RARa fusion protein, which leads to the accumulation of abnormal promyelocytes. Xenograft mouse models with human leukemic cells have advantages for analyzing the human leukemias in vivo , especially for genetic analyses. However, human primary APL cells are difficult to engraft even in very severely immunodeficient mice, such as NOD/shi-SCID IL2Rg -/- (NOG) mice. In order to understand the mechanisms involved in human APL leukemogenesis, we established a humanized in vivo APL model using the transplantation of PML-RARA -transduced CD34 + cells from human cord blood into NOG mice. The expression of PML-RARa in the CD34 + cells disrupted the nuclear bodies in vitro . The clonogenic assay showed that PML-RARa inhibited the total colony formation, but favored the growth of myeloid colonies. When CD34 + cells with PML-RARA were transplanted, they proliferated in the NOG mice for more than three to four months after transplantation (in 24 out of the 34 mice). All 16 mice with more than 3,000 PML-RARA- transduced CD34 + cells were engrafted, while the engraftment was only detected in eight out of 18 mice when the cell density used for transplantation was less than 3,000 cells. These cells possessed abundant azurophilic abnormal granules in the cytoplasm, and some of them had bundles of Auer rods. They expressed CD13, CD33 and CD117, but not HLA-DR or CD34. In addition, the gene expression analysis revealed that these cells and human primary APL were clustered together among various types of AML, suggesting that these induced APL cells well recapitulated human primary APL. Similar to human primary APL, the induced APL cells possessed the ability for myeloid differentiation after treatment with all- trans retinoic acid in vitro and in vivo , and a very low potential for re-transplantation, which was similarly observed in both unsorted induced APL cells and the CD34 - fraction. When human cord blood was fractionated before the PML-RARA transduction, the CD34 + /CD38 + cells and common myeloid progenitors (CMP) in the CD34 + /CD38 + cells led to the efficient development of APL in vivo . These findings demonstrate that CMP is a target for PML-RARA in APL, whereas the resultant CD34 - APL cells may share the ability to maintain the leukemia.
