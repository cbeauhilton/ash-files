    "abstract_text": "Intracellular calcium mobilization plays a critical role in platelet signaling. Upon platelet activation, an intracellular calcium mobilization leads to the activation of various intracellular and membrane proteins, including integrins involved in both platelet shape change and aggregation. The goal of the present study was to monitor platelet calcium mobilization in vivo in an intact animal and to determine which intracellular pathways are dominant in platelet accumulation into the developing thrombus. Platelets were isolated from mice, washed, loaded with a calcium-sensitive fluorochrome, Fura2-AM and then infused into a recipient mouse. We studied Fura2-AM loaded platelet incorporation during arterial thrombus development following laser injury of the vessel wall in the cremaster microcirculation of living mice using high speed intravital widefield digital microscopy. Fura-2 loaded platelets were monitored by excitation at 380 nm; this fluorescence reports the basal calcium levels in platelets. Calcium mobilization was monitored by excitation at 340 nm where the fluorescence intensity reflects Fura2-calcium complex formation. We observed that platelets bind to the growing thrombus independent of calcium mobilization. However, the stable incorporation of platelets into the thrombus correlated with a significant intracellular calcium increase. Once the thrombus reached maximal size at about 100 seconds, the calcium mobilization also reached maximal intensity. Subsequently, platelets that did not mobilize calcium dissociated from the thrombus. We confirmed these observations by using platelets treated with the calcium chelators, BAPTA-AM or EGTA-AM. We observed a significant inhibition of platelet accumulation into the thrombus, indicating that the intracellular calcium increase is necessary in vivo for the stable accumulation of the platelets into the thrombus. We also evaluated the involvement in vivo of two platelet agonists, ADP and thromboxane A2 (TxA2), on calcium mobilization and platelet incorporation into thrombi. When platelets were treated with aspirin or with the P2Y1 antagonist A3P5P (adenosine 3\u2032-phosphate-5\u2032-phosphate), we observed a partial decrease in both calcium mobilization and platelet accumulation into the thrombus. These results indicate that TxA2 and ADP via the P2Y1 receptor are involved in vivo in platelet activation upon vessel wall injury in this thrombosis model. When platelets were treated with both compounds, we completely inhibited the calcium increase and the incorporation of platelets into the thrombus. Altogether, our results directly show, for the first time in vivo , the importance of the calcium mobilization on platelet accumulation into the developing thrombus. The platelet agonists TxA2 and ADP both play an important and complementary role on platelet activation by acting on the mobilization of the intracellular calcium.",
