    "abstract_text": "Background: The humanized anti-CD74 monoclonal antibody, milatuzumab (hLL1, or IMMU-115; Immunomedics, Inc, Morris Plains, NJ), is in clinical evaluation for therapy of multiple myeloma (MM) after preclinical evidence of activity in this tumor type ( Stein et al, Blood  2004 ; 104 : 3705 ). Here we examine the ability of milatuzumab to increase the efficacy of drugs in MM cell lines. Methods: MTT cytotoxicity assays were performed on a panel of MM cell lines, including CAG, KMS11, KMS12-PE, and MC/CAR, to examine the effects of bortezomib, doxorubicin (dox), and dexamethasone (dex) alone and combined with milatuzumab or milatuzumab + crosslinking 2nd Ab (goat anti-human IgG, GAH). In vivo studies used a CAG-SCID mouse model of disseminated disease. Results: Without drugs, crosslinked milatuzumab, but not milatuzumab alone, yielded significant anti-proliferative effects on the four MM cell lines. In combination studies, crosslinked milatuzumab produced significant reductions in the IC50 values of the anti-MM drugs. For example, in CAG, milatuzumab+GAH decreased the IC50 values 58%, 78%, and 98% for bortezomib, dox, and dex, respectively (P=0.0034, 0.0073, and 0.078, respectively). In vivo , milatuzumab at 100 \u03bcg/injection, 2x weekly for 4 weeks, starting 1 day after injection of CAG cells, more than doubled the median survival time (MST) from 42 days in untreated CAG-bearing SCID mice to 103 days. Combination therapy with milatuzumab and bortezomib or dox was compared to milatuzumab alone, with treatments initiated 5 days after injection of CAG cells. Bortezomib alone (1.0 mg/kg) increased MST from 33 to 44 days (P=0.0021 vs. untreated). Treatment with milatuzumab alone (100 \u03bcg/mouse) increased the MST to 73 days (P<0.0001 vs. untreated). When bortezomib and milatuzumab treatments were combined, the MST increased to 93 days (P=0.0441 vs. milatuzumab and P=0.0065 vs. bortezomib). Thus, the combination of milatuzumab and bortezomib increased survival significantly compared to either single treatment. Given alone, dox yielded little or no effect on survival compared with untreated animals, and there was no significant difference between milatuzumab monotherapy and milatuzumab plus doxorubicin in this model. In contrast, a milatuzumabdox immunoconjugate was found to be a highly effective therapeutic agent, with all mice achieving long-term survival. The inhibition of the NF-\u03baB survival pathway of B-leukemic cells by milatuzumab supports its complementary effects when combined with drugs having different mechanisms of action, such as bortezomib. Conclusions: The therapeutic efficacies of bortezomib, dox, and dex are enhanced in vitro in MM cell lines when given in combination with milatuzumab. In vivo , milatuzumab alone or especially in combination with bortezomib is highly effective in MM.
