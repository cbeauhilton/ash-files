    "abstract_text": "Inhibitors of c-Kit kinase have shown clinical relevance in various myeloid disorders, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Research in our lab has been oriented towards structure-based drug design of c-Kit inhibitors based on the available crystal structure. We describe the design, synthesis, and preliminary results from the in-vitro testing of several c-Kit kinase inhibitors in both enzymatic and cell-based assays. The design resulted from in-silico screening of several targeted libraries via docking to the crystal structure of c-Kit, followed by aggressive post-filtering by several criteria to significantly bias synthesis efforts towards candidate compounds with best chance for success. This led to 128 structures built from 8 common structural cores, from which 2 cores were initially selected based on the synthetic feasibility. Five compounds were initially synthesized, and were immediately followed by 60 compounds with variations to probe local structure-activity relationships. The initial set of compounds, designated APCKxxx, was tested in a c-Kit kinase assay; two compounds were found to have an IC50 in the high nM to low uM range. These compounds have been tested in a MTT-based assay using OCIM2 and OCI/AML3 cell lines. In the c-Kit expressing OCI/AML3 cell line, all five compounds possessed an EC50 < 500 nM and two had and EC50 ~100 nM. Our most recent results show that these compounds also show efficacy in some imatinib-resistant cell lines. We will discuss these results and our strategies for the second generation of compounds that are optimized for better activity, selectivity, and ADME properties.",
