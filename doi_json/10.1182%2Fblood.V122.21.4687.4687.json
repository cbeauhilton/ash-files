    "abstract_text": "Cerebral vasculopathy is one of the major complications of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). 11% of the homozygous SCD patients experience stroke by age of 20 years. The use of Transcranial Doppler (TCD) allows identification of patients at risk for stroke and leads to implementation of a preventive treatment that contributes to limit the burden of SCD particularly during childhood. Using TCD screening, we evaluated the prevalence and incidence of cerebral vasculopathy in Malian SCD children. During the years 2008 to 2013, 572 children, 249 girls and 323 boys, age range (2-17yrs) were routinely screened by TCD at our Sickle Cell Disease Research and Control Center of Bamako, Mali. The overall prevalence of cerebral vasculpathy defined by conditional (1.5-1.79 cm/sec) and abnormal TCD (\u2265 1.80 cm/sec) in this population is 17.1%. The highest proportion (92.9%) was observed in homozygous SCD patients while the percentage of affected patients was much lower in S/\u03b2 0 thalassemia (4.1%) and in SC (3.1%) patients. No cases were observed in S/\u03b2 + thalassemia patients. SCD children <9 years old were more susceptible to cerebral vasculopathy complications than those above this age threshold (P<0.001). Low hemoglobin levels and low fetal hemoglobin were associated with an increased risk of cerebral vasculopathy. During the study, 4 of 444 children with normal TCD converted to conditional TCD, while 5 of 68 children with conditional TCD converted to abnormal TCD. This conversion from conditional to abnormal TCD was associated with a mean decrease in Hb value of 0.37g/dL (P=0.002). In conclusion this study shows high prevalence and incidence of cerebral vasculopathy in Malian SCD children. While chronic transfusion programs significantly reduces the risk of stroke in SCD patients with abnormal TCD, at present there are no well articulated strategies to prevent conversion from conditional to abnormal TCD. A more comprehensive approach would hopefully reduce the morbidity and mortality due to cerebral vasculopathy in SCD affected children. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
