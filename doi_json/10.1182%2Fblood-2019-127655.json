    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only treatment modality offering cure or long-term survival for many hematologic malignancies, and non-malignant diseases in children. HLA-matched siblings are considered the best donors because of reduced risks of transplant-related complications and better clinical outcome. According to the National Marrow Donor Program Guidelines, the maximum amount of bone marrow harvest is limited to 20ml/kg donor's body weight. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the optimal bone marrow harvest volume in pediatric donors needed to obtain the desired CD34+ cell count. METHODS: We reviewed medical charts of 553 pediatric (age at harvest <18 years) sibling donors who were harvested for bone marrow from Jan 2007 to Dec 2017 at our institution for pediatric (age at infusion < 14 years) transplant na\u00efve recipients in order to examine the volume harvested per donor's weight, the percentage of harvests that reached the minimum desired CD34+ cell count of \u22653.0X10^6 per Kg of recipient weight, harvest related hospitalization days and side effects related to the procedure and the impact of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF) priming on CD34 count of harvested bone marrow. RESULTS: 288 out of 553 donors were male. 155 (28%) were below 5 years of age at harvest, 189 (34.2%) were between 5-10 and remaining 209 (37.8%) were 10 years and above, with a median of 8.4 years (range: 0.2-17.9). Primary indication for transplant among 131 (23.7%) of our pediatric recipients were Malignant Disorders, Non-Malignant Disorders in 214 (38.7%) and Primary Immunodeficiency and Histiocytic Disorders in 208 (37.6%). GCSF priming was carried out in 219 (39.6%) donors. The minimum desired CD34+ cell count of \u22653.0X10^6 per Kg of recipient weight was reached in 517 (93.5%) harvests. Post infusion Absolute Neutrophil Counts (ANC) recovery within Day+28 was recorded among 472 (85.4%) of the transplant na\u00efve recipients, while in 72 (13%) cases ANC never recovered and in remaining 9 (1.6%) time to recovery was beyond Day+28. ANC recovery within Day+28 was significantly associated with CD34+ cell dose of \u22653.0X10^6 per Kg of recipient weight (n=441, 93.4% vs. 31, 6.6%; P-Value<0.001). Median CD34+ cells (X10^6) collected per Kg of donor weight were significantly higher among donors younger than 5 years of age when compared to those 10 and beyond (P-Value <0.001) with a median harvested volume of 13.7, 12.0 and 8.3 mL/Kg (P-Value<0.001, Table 1). On the same note, median CD34+ cells collected per donor weight were significantly higher among donors primed with GCSF in contrast to those who did not (6.02 X10^6 vs. 3.1 X10^6, P-value <0.001). 54 (9.8%) of our donors required PRBC transfusion; among whom 34 (63%) were below 5 years of age at harvest, 15 (27.8%) 5-10 years and remaining 5 (9.3%) were 10 and above (P-Value<0.001). 2 (0.5%) donors were hospitalized for four days, 12 (3.2%) for three, 201 (54.3%) for two and 155 (42%) for one day only. No significant side effects were noted among our donor population. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that CD34 cell count were significantly higher among younger donors. The use of Higher CD34 cell dose is significantly associated with engraftment. Priming with G-CSF had significant impact on CD34+ cell count. These large data confirm the suggestion that the volume of bone marrow harvested can be decreased among younger donors without significantly changing the overall CD34 cell count.
