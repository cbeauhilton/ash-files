    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) represents a post-remission therapy offering potential cure for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (pts). Reduced-Intensity Conditioning (RIC) is increasingly used in AML pts undergoing HCT ineligible for conventional conditioning. The ecotropic viral integration site 1 ( EVI1 ) gene maps to chromosome 3q26 and encodes a transcription factor that has an important role during embryogenesis. EVI1 activation, e.g. through chromosome 3 translocations, is found in several human myeloid disorders. The presence of EVI1 expression has been described as a predictor of poor outcome in pts treated with standard cytarabine based chemotherapy. Whether the expression of EVI1 also associates with outcome in AML pts undergoing RIC-HCT, with a therapeutic approach mainly based on a graft-versus-leukemia effect, remains unknown. Here we tested the prognostic impact of EVI1 expression in RIC-HCT treated AML pts. We analyzed 57 AML pts (median age, 61 years [y]; range 27\u201374y) who received RIC (Fludarabin 30mg/m ^ 2 at day-4 to -2 & 2Gy total body irradiation at day 0)-HCT at the University of Leipzig, with pretreatment bone marrow material available. Donors were human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related (n=6, 10.5%) or HLA-matched (n=41; 72%) or mismatched (>= 1 antigen; n=10; 17.5%) unrelated. At HCT 82.4% (n=47) of the pts were in complete remission (CR). 28.6% (n=14) had acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD; >= grade 2) and 80.5% (n=33) (31.7% (n=13) limited; 48.8% (n=20) extensive) chronic GvHD. Median follow-up was 7.0 y for pts alive. Medical research council (MRC) genetic classification was: intermediate (n=39; 73.5%) or adverse (n=14; 26.5%). The pts were also characterized for CEBPA and NPM1 mutations, as well as presence of an FLT3 -ITD at diagnosis. EVI1 expression was measured with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and normalized to 18S . 71.9% (n=41) of our pts were EVI1 expressers. The presence of EVI1 expression did not significantly associate with any clinical or biological characteristics. Still, by trend EVI1 expression associated with an adverse karyotype ( P =.08) and NPM1 mutations ( P =.16). The presence of EVI1 expression significantly associated with shorter overall survival (OS; P =.04) and event-free survival (EFS; P =.03; Figure 1 ).

However, in multivariable analysis cytogenetics (intermediate vs. adverse) associated with OS by trend ( P =.12); while EVI1 expression status ( P =.14), cytogenetics (intermediate vs adverse; P =.11) and remission status at the time point of RIC-HCT (CR vs all other; P =.10) associated with EFS by trend. In conclusion, the presence of EVI1 expression associated with worse outcome in RIC-HCT treated AML pts. Pretreatment EVI1 expression may refine the risk stratification for AML pts undergoing RIC-HCT. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
