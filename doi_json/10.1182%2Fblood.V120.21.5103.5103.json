Methods IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and EPO in plasma samples from 45 lymphoma patients and 12 controls were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and EPOR on their bone marrow cells were detected by flow cytometry. Their bone marrow CFU-E were cultured in vitro also. Results Of 45 initial lymphoma patients, 25 (55. 6%) had anemia before diagnosis, 13(28. 9%) had anemia during therapy, 7(15. 5%)never had anemia. Plasma IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 levels were significantly higher in severe and moderate anemia patients than those in mild anemia patients, no anemia patients and controls. Patient's plasma EPO, IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3levels showed an inverse correlation to their Hb. Lymphoma without anemia patients had significantly high bone marrow EPOR level than that of lymphoma associated anemia patients and controls. Patients bone marrow CFU-E showed positive correlation to their Hb and EPOR. Conclusion Increased plasma IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 might contribute to anemia in lymphoma, EPO and EPOR levels were elevated to balance such negetive effects and maintain hemotopoiesis.
