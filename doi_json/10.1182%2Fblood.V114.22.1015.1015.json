    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1015 Poster Board I-37 Background: Early mortality, mostly from hemorrhagic complications, occurs in less than 10% of patients currently treated in clinical trials for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, data about the proportion of patients developing such complications prior to clinical trial enrollment are scarce in the literature (Sanz M, et al Blood 2009). Approximately 5% of newly diagnosed patients with APL have been reported not to be eligible for participation in clinical trials due to very poor clinical condition, and their outcome has never been reported. However, enrollment on clinical trials may be difficult in specific clinical situations, such as after hours/weekend admissions and/or emergent requirement for therapy. This study reports the incidence, time of occurrence and clinical features of APL patients with a focus on early mortality. Methods: 150 consecutive APL patients treated at Stanford University between 8/1986 and 7/2009 were identified. Thirteen patients were excluded for lack of appropriate clinical information. Clinical features of patients with APL were analyzed for factors that might be relate to prognosis, including age, gender, white blood cell count, platelet count, fibrinogen, PTT, and INR. Continuous variables were compared with the t -test and categorical variables by Fisher's exact test or X-square statistic. The Kaplan\u2013Meier method was applied to assess overall survival time. Results: Of the 137 patients included in this analysis, the median age at diagnosis was 45 (1-93) years and 78 (57%) were females. Using the PETHEMA criteria, there were 37, 46 and 20 patients with high-, intermediate- and low-risk disease (34 patients could not be classified based on partial/missing data). With a median follow-up time of 748 (0-6,235) days for the entire cohort, 52 (38%) have died. 19 (14%) and 11 (8%) of these patients died within 7 and 3 days of presentation, respectively. Patients with high-risk features had a 13% and 24% chance of dying with 3 and 7 days of presentation, respectively, with significantly inferior outcomes ( p =0.045) when compared to those with intermediate-risk patients (6% and 13%) and low-risk disease (5% and 5%). Patients with unknown risk category faired similarly to low-risk patients. The most common cause of early mortality in these 19 patients was intracranial hemorrhage (n=11). Patients with early death (ED) (either 7d), or APL patients alive as of their last follow-up (median age 54 years vs. 50 years vs. 39 years), and were more likely to have higher risk disease, though coagulopathy appeared not significantly different amongst the groups. Median fibrinogen, PTT and INR for each individual group are presented on Table 1 . The 3-year overall survival (% +/- SE) of the low, intermediate, and high risk patients was 90+/-7, 74+/-7, and 64+/-8, respectively, though early mortality (death within 7 days) was a major determinant of this stratification ( p =0.045).

In this cohort, 25% and 13% patients with high- and intermediate-risk APL died within 7 days of presentation, respectively. Risk group stratification was very predictive of risk of early death.
