    "abstract_text": "A feature of many integrins is their ability to interact with ligands containing an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif. RGD-containing peptides and peptidomimetics can inhibit ligand binding to these integrins, including the binding of fibrinogen and von Willebrand Factor (VWF) to the major platelet integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Despite substantial sequence conservation, RGD-containing peptides interact poorly with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 on rat and mouse platelets compared to human platelets, a phenomenon we previously found to be due to sequence differences in the third and fourth N-terminal repeats of human and rat \u03b1IIb. To localize the specific residues that control RGD sensitivity and determine whether these residue differences determine sensitivity for all RGD-based ligands, we constructed a series of inter-species chimeric \u03b1IIb\u03b23 molecules in which non-conserved residues in the loops connecting the 2nd and 3rd and the 3rd and 4th blades of the amino-terminal \u03b1IIb \u03b2 propeller were exchanged between the rat and human proteins. We then measured the inhibitory effect of the tetrapeptide RGDS and the tyrosine-based RGD peptidomimetic tirofiban on fibrinogen to the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 chimeras expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We chose to study tirofiban because it is a more extended molecule than RGDS with a greater distance between its positively-charged arginine and negatively-charged aspartate moieties. We found that specific substitutions in either the 2\u20133 loop (a combination of V 156 \u0394, E 157 S, D 159 G, and W 162 G (mature human \u03b1IIb numbering)) or in the D 232 H 3\u20134 loop affected the sensitivity of rat \u03b1IIb\u03b23 to the inhibitory effects of RGDS alone or in combination. To alter tirofiban sensitivity, only a simultaneous substitution in both loops was effective. Mouse \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is also resistant to RGDS, and this resistance is localized to the same region of the 2\u20133 loop. There is no D 232 H in mouse \u03b1IIb, and murine \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is as expected as sensitive to tirofiban as its human counterpart. It is of interest that in the published structure of an RGD pentapeptide soaked into the crystal of the related integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 two residues complex with the Arg. These residues are homologous to \u03b1IIb D 163 and D 232 , the former located immediately adjacent to the substituted residues in the 2\u20133 loop that affect RGD resistance and the latter being the important difference between human and rat in the 3\u20134 loop. Whether D 163 and D 232 complex to RGDS on \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is unknown. In the published crystal structure of the extracellular portion of human \u03b1IIb\u03b23 co-crystallized with either of several extended RGD-like compounds, the basic residue of the RGD-like compounds was found to hydrogen bond to \u03b1IIb D 224 , a residue located at the base of a pocket that is formed by the 2\u20133 and 3\u20134 loops and that is highly conserved among different \u03b1IIb species. Our results indicate that sensitivity to such an extended RGD-containing compounds is determined by the composition of the walls of this pocket, thereby facilitating or impeding access to D 224 . Thus these differences in \u03b1IIb composition and function between human and rodent \u03b1IIb\u03b23, which may have been an evolutionary response to venomous exposure by rodents, may provide insights into the intermediate steps by which the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 receptor binds to its natural ligands."
