    "abstract_text": "Background: In 2003 the Blood Transfusion Center, Cliniques Universitaires Mont Godinne, Yvoir, Belgium implemented routine use of pathogen inactivation photochemical treatment (PCT) of platelet (PLT) components (INTERCEPT\u2122 Blood System, Cerus Europe, Leusden, The Netherlands) for transfusion support of thrombocytopenia. Based on in vitro clonal T cell proliferation assays (> 5 log T cell inactivation), biochemical assays (1 adduct every 83 base pairs), animal studies (prevention of GVHD in a parent to F-1 model), and clinical trial experience ( Bone Marrow Transplantation  2004 ; 33 : 1 \u20137 ), PCT of PLT was used in place of gamma irradiation to inactivate residual donor T cells for prevention of TA-GVHD. Other blood components continued to be treated with gamma irradiation according to standard operating procedures. Surveillance of all patients at risk for TA-GVHD transfused with PCT PLT was conducted for 3 years (11/2003 \u2013 11/2006) after adoption of PCT, and the incidence of TA-GVHD determined. Methods: PLT were collected on the Amicus Cell Separator (Fenwal Blood Technologies, Nivelles, Belgium) with process leuko-reduction. PLT were suspended in Intersol (Fenwal) with a ratio to plasma of \u223c 65:35%. PLT containing 2.5 to 6.0 \u00d7 10 11 plts in \u223c 300 mL were prepared with an integrated processing set using amotosalen (150 uM) and UVA (3 J/cm 2 ) to inactivate pathogens and leukocytes. PCT PLT units were issued the day after collection and stored for up to 7 d. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients were selected as a high risk population for TA-GVHD, and monitored for evidence of TA-GVHD with an active hemovigilance program. TA-GVHD was diagnosed using established criteria ( N Engl J Med  1990 ; 323 : 315 \u201321 ). Results: During 3 years, 756 patients received 7,538 PCT PLT transfusions and 76 patients with a spectrum of hematologic diseases (Table) were treated with HSCT (n = 93: 75 auto- and 18 allo-grafts) and were supported with PCT PLT. 15 patients received 2 auto grafts, and one received 3. All HSCT patients were deemed at risk for TA-GVHD due to immune suppressive and/or myelo-ablative therapy including TBI (n = 19). Auto graft patients (n = 59) received a median of 7 PCT PLT (range 2\u201394). Allo graft patients (n = 17) received a median of 11 PCT PLT (range 3 \u2013 127). No patient developed evidence of TA-GVHD during the 3-year period. Conclusions: PCT of PLT prevented TA-GVHD in a population of HSCT patients at risk for TA-GVHD exposed to multiple platelet transfusions. Use of PCT to treat all PLT components avoided the need to identify at risk patients and permitted the use of a single PLT inventory. These clinical data support the use of PCT for replacement of gamma irradiation to prevent TA-GVHD. Diagnoses of HSCT Patients At Risk For TA-GVHD  Diagnosis/Year . 2003 . 2004 . 2005 . 2006 .
