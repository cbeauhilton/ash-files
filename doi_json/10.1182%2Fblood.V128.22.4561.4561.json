    "abstract_text": "We have previously reported on the efficacy of the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib in corticosteroid-refractory (SR) acute (a) and chronic (c) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in 95 patients (pts) (Leukemia 2015;29(10):2062-8). To assess long-term follow-up results, we collected data from the same pts treated in 19 centers in Europe and the US. Pts were classified as SR-aGVHD (n=54, all grade III or IV) or SR-cGvHD (n=41, all moderate or severe). Median numbers of pre-ruxolitinib GVHD treatment lines were 3 (1-7) and 3 (1-10) for SR-aGVHD and SR-cGvHD, respectively. The median follow-up was 19 and 24 months for aGVHD and cGVHD, respectively. The 1-year overall survival (OS) from was 62.4% (CI: 49.4%-75.4%) and 92.7% (CI: 84.7%-100%) for SR-aGVHD and SR-cGvHD, respectively. The estimated median OS (50% death) was 18 months for aGVHD and not reached for cGVHD patients. The median duration of ruxolitinib treatment was 5 and 10 months for patients with SR-aGVHD and SR-cGVHD, respectively reflecting the different biology of the diseases. At follow-up, 22/54 (41%) of SR-aGVHD patients and 10/41 (24%) of SR-cGVHD patients have an ongoing response and are free of any immunosuppression. GVHD relapse or progression after achieved PR/CR was observed in 14/45 (31%) and 13/36 (36%) patients with SR-aGVHD and SR-cGVHD, respectively. Response to re-treatment with Ruxolitinib or any immunosupressive therapy was seen in 11/14 (78%) and 11/13 (86%) patients with SR-aGVHD and SR-cGVHD, respectively. Cytopenia (any grade) and CMV-reactivation were observed during ruxolitinib-treatment in both SR-aGVHD (30/54, 55.6% and 18/54, 33.3%) and SR-cGVHD (7/41, 17.1% and 6/41, 14.6%) patients. These findings extend our previous report by showing that patients with SR-aGVHD and SR-cGVHD may benefit long-term from ruxolitinib treatment with an OS that is relatively high for steroid-refractory GVHD. GVHD-relapse or GVHD-progression rates were moderate and more than 75% of the relapse/progression patients responded to re-treatment with ruxolitinib or other immunosuppression.
