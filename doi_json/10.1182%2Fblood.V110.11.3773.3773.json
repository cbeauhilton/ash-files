    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The human parvovirus B19 (pvB19) is well known as a cause of chronic anemia and red cell aplasia, this due to the high tropism for the erythroid progenitor cells where it replicates. Some reports have suggested that the infection of this virus is related to an erythropoietin resistance in patients with chronic anemia and kidney failure. The most frequent causes of erythropoietin resistance are iron deficiency, chronic inflammation process, vitamin deficiency, hyperparathyroidism and malignancies among others. The aim of this study was to detect the viral DNA of PvB19 and its correlation with hemoglobin levels and human erythropoietin dosage in patients with kidney failure under hemodialysis treatment. Patients and Methods: All patients had chronic renal failure and were undergoing hemodialysis. The detection of the viral DNA was performed by qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR reaction was carried out using one specifically designed primer set for PvB19 that encoded for a structural capsid protein (VP1). Erythropoietin resistance (ER) was diagnosed using the European Best practice Guidelines as stated by Hay N (Nephrology, 2002). Results: A total of 58 samples of peripheral blood were obtained from patients with chronic kidney failure. Mean age was 59.41 (23 to 85 years) and mean Hemoglobin levels were 10.1 g/dL (7\u201314). Iron was normal in all patients and no patient had active infections. Fifty two patients (89.65%) were receiving recombinant erythropoietin. Among all the samples, 3 cases met ER criteria but only in 1 of them did we find the viral DNA (1.72%). Three cases (5.17%) positive to the viral DNA were found in the non erythropoietin resistance group. Conclusion: Although ours is a small group and we are still gathering samples, up until now, no relation appears to exist between the presence of PvB19 genetic material and ER."
