    "abstract_text": "Introduction . ETO2 - GLIS2 (aka CBFA2T3 - GLIS2 ) is the most common (30%) alteration in pediatric de novo acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL). These patients have poor response to induction therapy, a high incidence of relapse (~90%), and dismal 5-year survival rates (<20%). Previous studies suggest that ETO2 - GLIS2 induces leukemia through abnormal enhancer formation as a single oncogenic \"hit\". Because ETO2 - GLIS2 expression induces formation of leukemia-specific neo-superenhancer (SE) elements, we hypothesize that mediator (MED) proteins are involved in linking neo-SE elements to distal gene expression, and thus could be a therapeutic target. Here, we analyzed expression of MED-family genes in ETO2 - GLIS2 positive AMKL patients in combination with enhancer-histone marks, and evaluated impact of MED-kinase inhibition with selective CDK8 inhibitors (CDKi) against cell viability. Methods. To address our hypothesis, we analyzed published RNA sequencing dataset (Smith et al. 2020) for human MED-genes expression from a pan-pediatric AML cohort (N=1476). The cohort consisted of subgroups expressing fusions of ETO2 - GLIS2 (N=40), CBFB - MYH11 (N=174), DEK - NUP214 (N=49), KMT2A - ELL (N=50), KMT2A - MLLT10 (N=86), KMT2A - MLLT3 (N=114), KMT2A - MLLT4 (N=49), NUP98 - NSD1 (N=107), RUNX1 - RUNX1T1 (N=210) and no detectable fusions (N=526), compared to normal bone marrow (NBM) samples (N=71). Enrichment of histone marks overlapping MED-genes was analyzed from published chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing in ETO2 - GLIS2 positive M-07e AMKL line (Thirant et al. 2017). We tested efficacy of CDK8 inhibition with BI-1347 and CCT251545 against M-07e cells to determine their activity in the context of marked MED12L overexpression. Results. We examined expression of 29 MED-genes comprising the 4 major (head, middle, tail, and kinase) MED-modules. MED gene expression was variable across AML subtypes and NBM. However, MED genes were more commonly over-expressed in the ETO2-GLIS2 group, in particular MED 17 , MED1 , MED10 , MED27 , and MED12L (paralog of MED12 ) were upregulated in the subgroup. Most notably, we noted exceptional upregulation of MED12L (FC 4.9, log2), compared to NBM (Figure 1). Because MED12/12L plays an intrinsic biological role in establishing oncogenic enhancer-expression loops in hematopoietic stem or leukemic cells, we investigated the overlap of enhancer bound histones such as H3K27ac and H3K4me1 to MED12L in M-07e cells, compared to umbilical cord blood-derived normal megakaryoblasts (MK) (S004BT; Blueprint epigenome database). We found enrichment of H3K4me1 at MED12L transcription start site (TSS) and upstream promoter both in MK and M-07e cells. In addition, we observed a large region of H3K27ac enrichment spanning 89 Kb (16 kb upstream and 73 kb downstream) across MED12L TSS in M-07e cells, suggesting neo-enhancer activity at this locus. Considering the dependency of MED12 on CDK8 for MED-kinase activities (Klatt et al. 2020), we treated M-07e cells with CDK8i(s), to test our hypothesis if perturbation of epigenetically enhanced MED12L expression can impact leukemic growth. However, we observed a poor correlation between M-07e cell viability and IC 50 of BI-1347 (IC 50 : 0.87 \u00b5M, R 2 : 0.36) or CCT251545 (IC 50 : 0.4 \u00b5M, R 2 : 0.48). In contrast, ETO2-GLIS2 negative MV4-11 AML cells were susceptible to both BI-1347 (IC 50 : 0.44 \u00b5M, R 2 : 0.88) and CCT251545 (IC 50 : 0.12 \u00b5M, R 2 : 0.87). Given the inefficacy of CDK8i against M-07e, and cooperativity of bromodomain extra-terminal (BET)-BRD4 and MED12/12L in forming enhancer complexes, we tested possible inhibitory impact of BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 on MED12L expression and leukemic growth in target cells. We observed effective reduction in M-07e cell viability (IC 50 :0.3 \u00b5M, R 2 : 0.93) with concomitant reduction not only in BRD4 protein-expression, but diminished MED12L protein expression at IC 50 and higher doses of JQ1. Conclusion. Our findings revealed that MED12L is highly overexpressed and overlapped with strong neo-enhancer chromatin-marks in ETO2 - GLIS2 positive cells, while maintaining resistance to CDK8i. Future studies will contribute to deeper insights into the preferential recruitment and role of MED12L in ETO2-GLIS2 bound enhancers and potential mechanisms of resistance to CDK8 inhibition in the disease.
