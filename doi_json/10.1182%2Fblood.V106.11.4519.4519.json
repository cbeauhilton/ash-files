    "abstract_text": "Trisomies are uncommon cytogenetic abnormalities in patient with de novo AML. Survival of patients with trisomy 13 ranges from 0.5 to 14.7 months. We present the treatment outcome of a 71-year-old man with de novo AML and trisomy 13 who had PBSCT in first complete remission. A 71-year Puerto Rican male was diagnosed with AML in April 2003. His CBC showed WBC count 177 K/mm3, hemoglobin 10.3 gm/dl, platelets 43 K/mm3 and blast cells 75%. Flow cytometry revealed that the leukemic blasts were CD33, CD13, CD11c and CD56 positive but negative for CD34. Cytogenetics failed to yield any metaphases. Peripheral blood FISH studies revealed trisomy 13 positivity in 300 of 325 cells analyzed. Patient received induction chemotherapy with high dose Ara-c (HiDAC) 3g/m2 QD x 5 doses and mitoxantrone 80mg/m2 on day # 2. Bone marrow done day 28 post induction chemotherapy revealed residual leukemic blasts. Cytogenetics showed that one out twenty metaphases had trisomy 13 along with translocation t (9:18) (q34; q10). 11.9% of cells had trisomy 13 by FISH analysis. The patient then received a second cycle of chemotherapy with HiDAC at 2 g/m2 Q12 x 12 doses. Bone marrow biopsy on day 35 following reinduction chemotherapy revealed normocellular-regenerating marrow in remission and FISH was negative for trisomy 13. On the third cycle of chemotherapy, patient received Etoposide 11 mg/kg. Neupogen was started on day #3 and 10.3 x 10 6 CD34 positive cells/kg were collected. The patient then underwent autologous PBSCT using Melphalan 160 mg/m2 as the preparative regimen. On Day +87 and Day +182 post transplant, bone marrow biopsy showed complete remission with FISH negative for trisomy 13. The patient is still alive 27 months after initial treatment and 22 months post PBSCT. Autologous PBSCT in first complete remission for AML with trisomy 13 may provide a superior survival than chemotherapy alone.",
