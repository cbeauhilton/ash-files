    "abstract_text": "Previous studies have shown that fibrin(ogen) supports metastasis. In order to better define the mechanisms coupling fibrin(ogen) to metastasis, we compared metastatic potential in immunocompetent mice carrying specific structure/function alterations in fibrinogen and controls. Fibrinogen AEK mice, which have a germ-line mutation in the thrombin cleavage site that essentially \"locks\" fibrinogen in its soluble state, exhibited diminished metastatic potential relative to Fib WT mice. Notably, previous studies have established that factor XIII is also a significant determinant of metastasis. Taken together, these studies suggest that stable fibrin polymer formation is important in the metastatic process. However, Fib AEK retained significant metastatic potential relative to mice with complete fibrinogen deficiency, indicating that fibrinogen possesses prometastatic properties in the absence of polymer formation. Fibrin(ogen) has also been shown to mediate inflammatory cell functions through direct engagement of leukocyte integrins independently of its role in platelet aggregation. Given previous studies demonstrating that myeloid cells are promote metastatic potential, we hypothesized that fibrin(ogen)-mediated leukocyte engagement represents one mechanism by which fibrinogen drives metastasis. Consistent with this view, mice expressing a mutant fibrinogen lacking the y chain binding motif for the leukocyte integrin \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 (Fib\u03b3 390-396A ) had diminished metastatic potential in both spontaneous and experimental metastasis assays. Furthermore, fate analyses revealed that Fib\u03b3 390-396A results in diminished survival of newly-formed metastatic foci. The early reduction in metastatic potential observed in Fib\u03b3 390-396A mice suggests that fibrin(ogen) promotes metastasis by recruiting myeloid cells to the early metastatic niche. In order to explore this hypothesis, we performed experimental metastasis assays in immunocompetent mice in which macrophages or neutrophils were specifically depleted using either clodronate or an anti-Ly6G antibody. In contrast to mice carrying the Fib\u03b3 390-396A mutation, depletion of macrophages or neutrophils had no significant impact on the early survival of metastatic foci. These studies suggest that expression Fib\u03b3 390-396A limits metastatic potential via a mechanism independent of interactions with myeloid cells. In addition to disrupting fibrin-\u03b1 M \u03b2 2 interactions, elimination of the \u03b3 chain 390-396a binding motif has also been shown to limit factor XIII binding to fibrinogen. Given the established importance of FXIII in metastasis, it is conceivable that even subtle alterations in the kinetics of fibrin cross-linking resulting from expression of Fib\u03b3 390-396A limits metastatic potential.
