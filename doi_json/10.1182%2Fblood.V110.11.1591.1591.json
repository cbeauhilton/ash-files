    "abstract_text": "Core binding factor (CBF) is a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of RUNX1 (CBF\u03b1) and CBF\u03b2 subunits which are essential for normal blood cell development. CBF\u03b2 functions to increase the DNA-binding of the RUNX1 subunit 20\u201340 fold and to protect the RUNX1 subunit against ubiqitination and proteasome degradation, making this protein-protein interaction critical for CBF function. Two of the most common translocations involving the subunits of CBF are the inv(16) and the t(8;21) which produce the chimeric proteins CBF\u03b2-SMMHC and AML1-ETO, respectively, which are associated with the development of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). The AML1-ETO fusion protein is a dominant inhibitor of wildtype RUNX1-CBF\u03b2 activity in vivo and causes a blockage in normal hematopoiesis, predisposing for the development of leukemia. The interaction between CBF\u03b2 and AML1-ETO is critical for its function, therefore treatments targeting AML1-ETO and blocking its interaction with CBF\u03b2 are highly likely to be therapeutically beneficial. The CBF\u03b2-SMMHC fusion protein causes dysregulation of CBF function by means of anomalously tight binding to RUNX1. Since binding to RUNX1 is required for the dysfunction associated with CBF\u03b2-SMMHC, this interaction represents an excellent target for inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy. We have initiated efforts to develop small molecule inhibitors of the RUNX1-CBF\u03b2 interaction as possible therapeutics for the treatment of the associated leukemias. Both virtual screening searches, focused on the X-ray structures of RUNX1 Runt domain and CBF\u03b2, and high-throughput screening of NCI (National Cancer Institute) and Maybridge fragment libraries were used to identify initial lead compounds interacting with these proteins and blocking heterodimerization of CBF. Compounds were tested experimentally by FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) and ELISA for their inhibition of RUNX1-CBF\u03b2 interaction. This resulted in a number of initial lead compounds targeting either the Runt domain or CBF\u03b2 and inhibiting this protein-protein interaction. Based on the docking mode selected lead compounds were further optimized using medicinal chemistry approaches to increase their affinity and determine the structure-activity relationships (SAR). This resulted in several compounds with low micromolar affinity (IC 50 < 10 \u03bcM) which effectively block the heterodimerization of CBF in vitro and in a cell-based assay. Interestingly, compounds targeting CBF\u03b2 bind to a site displaced from the binding interface for RUNX1 as shown by the NMR-based docking, i.e. these compounds function as allosteric inhibitors of this protein-protein interaction. The most potent compounds were tested either in the Kasumi-1 leukemia cell line harboring t(8;21) translocation or in the ME-1 cell line with inv(16), resulting in a blockage of proliferation, induction of apoptosis and differentiation of these cells. These compounds represent the first small molecule inhibitors targeting CBF and inhibiting this interaction. They represent good starting points for the development of therapeutically useful inhibitors. Several approaches are being explored to modify these compounds to achieve selectivity towards AML1-ETO or CBF\u03b2-SMMHC oncoproteins versus wild type proteins.",
