    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is an anticoagulant protein that inhibits tissue factor and prothrombinase during early stages of the procoagulant response. It is produced in alternatively spliced isoforms. In humans, TFPI\u03b1 is within platelets and released upon activation and also is present in plasma, while TFPI\u03b2 is bound to the endothelial surface. Mice differ from humans in that they do not have TFPI\u03b1 in plasma, making them an optimal model system for study of the function of platelet TFPI\u03b1. Studies of murine hematopoietic cell TFPI using fetal liver transplantation models have found that platelet TFPI dampens platelet accumulation in a growing thrombus following vascular injury and alters bleeding severity in mice with hemophilia. However, results of these studies are potentially confounded by altered TFPI expression on other hematopoietic cells, such as monocytes. To better understand the function of platelet TFPI, murine models of total TFPI\u03b1 deletion (TFPI\u03b1 KO), of platelet-specific TFPI\u03b1 deletion (pTFPI\u03b1 KO) and platelet-specific TFPI\u03b1 over expression (pTFPI\u03b1 high) were produced and characterized. Methods : A TFPI\u03b1 deleted mouse was generated by inserting a stop codon within exon 10 of the TFPI gene effectively blocking translation of the highly conserved basic C-terminal region of TFPI\u03b1, but not altering TFPI\u03b2. The PF4-Cre transgene was bred into the floxed-TFPI(K1) mouse to produce mice specifically lacking platelet TFPI\u03b1. A transgenic mouse over expressing platelet TFPI\u03b1 under control of the GP1b promoter was produced. Mice were characterized for platelet and plasma TFPI antigen by ELISA, for activity by TF-FVIIa inhibition and whole blood platelet aggregation, and for bleeding by tail clip. Results : All 3 strains were viable and reproduced. Platelet TFPI antigen was decreased approximately 25-fold in the TFPI\u03b1 KO and pTFPI\u03b1 KO mice and elevated approximately 5-fold in the pTFPI\u03b1 high mice with corresponding changes in TF-FVIIa inhibitory activity. Plasma TFPI antigen was no different between pTFPI\u03b1 KO (20.6\u00b14.4 nM) and wild type (21.5\u00b16.2 nM) littermates. Plasma thrombin-antithrombin complex levels were not elevated in any strain. In tail clip bleeding time assays, there was no difference between pTFPI\u03b1 KO (0.23\u00b10.16 mg/ml Hb) and wild type (0.23\u00b10.37 mg/ml Hb), but there was a trend towards increased blood loss in pTFPI\u03b1 high mice (1.25\u00b11.8 mg/ml Hb). The pTFPI\u03b1 high mice also had altered whole blood platelet aggregation that was evident primarily in a prolonged time for initiation of aggregation with 6.50uM ADP (81\u00b112 sec vs. 6.1\u00b15.6 sec for control) or 0.8ug/ml collagen (35\u00b117 sec vs. 16\u00b121 sec for control). Finally, the pTFPI\u03b1 high transgene was bred into TFPI heterozygous mice which were then bred to determine if over expression of platelet TFPI\u03b1 would rescue the TFPI null embryonic lethal phenotype. However, no live TFPI null pups were observed following genotyping of over 50 pups from these matings. Conclusions : Three new mouse models of altered TFPI expression have been made providing valuable tools to study the role of platelet TFPI in bleeding and clotting disorders. Plasma TFPI is unchanged in mice lacking platelet TFPI demonstrating that platelet TFPI does not contribute to plasma TFPI in mice. Platelet TFPI\u03b1 antigen and activity correlate in all three models. Deletion of the basic C-terminal region in TFPI\u03b1 in the TFPI\u03b1 KO mice produces a TFPI\u03b1 hypomorphic mouse, with only trace amounts of truncated TFPI\u03b1 present in platelets. This lack of TFPI\u03b1 does not produce a generalized procoagulant state. The 5-fold excess TFPI\u03b1 antigen in the pTFPI\u03b1 high mice substantially delays the onset of platelet aggregation in whole blood assays initiated with collagen or ADP. Results from tail clip bleeding assays suggest that over expression of platelet TFPI\u03b1 may prolong bleeding in adult mice, but it is not sufficient to rescue the embryonic lethality of TFPI null mice.
