    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2900 Poster Board II-876 Ph-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms: polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primitive myelofibrosis (PMF) carry an acquired somatic mutation JAK2V617F in 95% (PV), and in 50 to 60% (ET or PMF) of the patients. Mutations of the TET2 gene have been observed with roughly similar frequencies in the three MPN, irrespective of the presence of JAK2 V617F. Evolution to myelofibrosis or acute leukemia may occur with time in MPN patients. Although its molecular bases are poorly understood, the evolution is likely due to the acquisition of additional mutations. To investigate whether cytogenetic abnormalities are distributed differently according to type of transformation and to the JAK2 and TET2 statuses, the Groupe Francophone de Cytoge\u0301ne\u0301tique He\u0301matologique has collected 82 patients with transformation of MPN. There were 66 (80%) acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes (AML/MDS) and 16 (20%) myelofibroses (MF). Of note pipobroman (Pi) treatment seems to be associated with MF, and hydroxyuera (Hu) with AML/MDS evolution in our series. Statistical analyses of clinical, cytogenetic and molecular data are shown Table 1 . On the cytogenetical point of view, several points are noteworthy. Some abnormalities were unevenly distributed: there were significantly more -7/del7q and -5/del5q in AML/MDS and tri1q and tri9 in MF. MF and PMF cytogenetic profile looked similar, suggesting a potential link between cytogenetic markers and the phenotype. Although the derivative chromosome der(1;7), observed in 9 patients, is responsible for a loss of 7q, it seemed different from patients with -7/del7q [excluding der(1;7)]. In the -7/del7q group, AML/MDS patients were more numerous than MF patients and the overall survival was shorter compared with the der(1;7) group (22/22 (100%) vs 6/9 (67%) AML/MDS, p=0.02; median: 4 vs 41 months, p=0.0007 respectively). Some specific associations could be observed, such as 17p deletions with 5q deletion (12/30, 40% vs 4/48, 8%, p=0.0007) and 20q deletion with der(1;7) (4/9 (44%) vs11/69 (16%), p=0.03). We detected 24/40 (60%) JAK2V617F and 8/25 (32%) TET2 mutations in transformed MPN, with all possible combinations between the wildtype and mutated forms of both genes. For one post-ET AML patient, JAK2V617F had been observed in a fraction of the granulocytes at the chronic phase. Analysis of blood cDNA obtained at chronic phase showed the same TET2 mutation as observed at acute phase. Because the blast cells were JAK2 wt- TET2 mut and carried a t(10;16)(q22;q23) affecting the CBFB gene, it is likely that the resulting non-MYH11 CBFB fusion gene transformed a JAK2 wt- TET2 mutated progenitor that predominated in the chronic phase. In conclusion, no specific chromosomal abnormality was associated with TET2 or JAK2 mutations. Chromosomal abnormalities were associated with a type of transformation (AML/MDS or MF), suggesting a specific role in the process. In addition, association between some chromosomal abnormalities suggest a specific oncogenic cooperation. Table 1.  n=82 . AML/MDS n=66 . MF n=16 . p univariate . p multivariate .
