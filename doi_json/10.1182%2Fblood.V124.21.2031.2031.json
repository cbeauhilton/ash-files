    "abstract_text": "Background Circulating plasma cells (PCs) have been identified as a prognostic factor in patients with myeloma precursor states (MGUS and SMM) and active multiple myeloma (MM). Enumeration of circulating PCs by available methods is not suitable for widespread use and does not provide molecular characterization. We developed and evaluated a novel method for enumeration and molecular characterization of circulating PCs (circulating multiple myeloma cells, \u201cCMMC\u201d), based on the CELLSEARCH \u00ae System (Janssen Diagnostics LLC, Raritan, NJ), an automated technology for the capture, enumeration and characterization of rare cells in the peripheral blood. Methods We are performing a prospective study of patients with MGUS and SMM to evaluate CMMCs as biomarker for progression to active MM. Utilizing the CELLSEARCH \u00ae System CMMCs were captured by CD138 ferrofluid magnetic particles and identification was defined as CD38+ and CD19-, CD45-. Nonviable cells were excluded by DAPI. Isolated CMMCs were stored and FISH for t(4:14), t(14;16) and del17 was performed. Results We have enrolled 16 patients, MGUS = 3, SMM = 11, and newly diagnosed MM = 2. The Mayo Risk stratification for MGUS patients was: low risk = 2, low-intermediate = 1. All SMM patients were low risk by Mayo Model incorporating serum free light chains. The median number of bone marrow plasma cells for MGUS patients was 7 (range 7-9) and for SMM patients was 15 (range 10-40). The median CMMCs for MGUS = 6 (range 2-55), median CMMCs for SMM = 31 (5-1918). The two patients with NDMM had 5870 and 5 CMMCs, respectively. A single patient with SMM progressed with a symptomatic solitary lumbar plasmacytoma and had CMMCs of 5 and 3 at baseline and progression, respectively. Abnormalities by FISH were detected in both bone marrow and CMMCs. Accrual is ongoing and additional data will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions The CELLSEARCH\u00ae CMMC assay can detect, quantify and provide molecular characterization of circulating PCs in MGUS/SMM/MM; longer prospective follow-up is needed to test the prognostic value of CMMCs.
