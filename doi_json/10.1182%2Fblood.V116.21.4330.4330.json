Methods With fluorescence quantitation kit and flow cytometry, G-CSFR expression density of 5 ALL cell lines were detected, and expression density changes due to G-CSF stimulation were evaluated. After treatment by G-CSF of various concentrations, changes of cell cycle and cell proliferation in ALL cell lines were examined by DNA-PREP -TM kit and Cell Counting Kit (CCK-8), respectively. After treatment by different concentration's Ara-C combined with different concentration's G-CSF, ALL cell lines\u2019 existing cell viability were detected by CCK-8. Results All 5 ALL cell lines expressed G-CSFR, 2 ALL cell lines including CCRF-CEM and 697 exhibited G-CSFR expression density up-regulation tendency after G-CSF's stimulation, while 3 T-ALL cell lines including MOLT-4, Jurkat,Clone E6-1, A3 showed G-CSFR expression density down-regulation tendency after G-CSF's stimulation, which was similar in neutrophil. Cell cycle analysis showed that S phase cell proportion in MOLT-4, Jurkat,Clone E6-1, A3 cell lines had a growing tendency after G-CSF\u2019 treatment, while no similar tendency was observed in CCRF-CEM, 697 cell lines. A relatively proliferative advantage was found in MOLT-4, Jurkat,Clone E6-1, A3 cell lines after G-CSF's treatment, but only in MOLT-4 there was a statistically significance after 10ng/ml G-CSF's stimulation. A synergetically anti-leukemic effect was observed in MOLT-4, Jurkat,Clone E6-1, A3 cell lines after Ara-C's treatment combined with G-CSF. Conclusions The biological characteristics of ALL cell lines expressing G-CSFR was different from each other. Synergetically anti-leukemic effect produced by cytotoxic agent and G-CSF could occur in ALL cell lines which showed a growing S phase cell proportation after G-CSF's treatment. ALL cell's response to G-CSF, which means down-regulation of G-CSFR expression density, seems a promising indicator that a synergetically effect could be produced by Ara-C plus G-CSF. Before this indicator could be applied for guiding ALL patients\u2019 management, clinical researches are needed to confirm it. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
