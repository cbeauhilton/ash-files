    "abstract_text": "SDX-101 is an oral antineoplastic agent, has been evaluated in a phase I/II study in B-cell malignancies. It induces cytotoxicity at least in part, by significantly inhibiting expression of Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein which is highly expressed in CLL cells. Here, we examined the cytotoxicity of SDX-101 against multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines. SDX-101 significantly inhibited growth in MM.1S, U266, RPMI8226 MM cell lines using MTT assays in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, with IC50s of 0.6mM, 1.0mM, and 0.4mM, respectively. In contrast, SDX-101 did not induce cytotoxicity in normal peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at these concentrations. Importantly, SDX-101 induced cytotoxicity even in dexamethasone (MM.1R)-, doxorubicin (RPMI-Dox40)-, and melphalan (LR5)- resistant MM cell lines. SDX-101 (0.3\u20131.25mM) triggered apoptosis associated with pro-caspase-3, pro-caspase-8, and PARP cleavage, as confirmed by immunoblotting. Although, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 completely abrogates Dex-induced MM cell apoptosis, neither protects against SDX-101-induced apoptosis in MM.1S and RPMI8226 cells. Moreover, dexamethasone, Melphalan, and AS 2 O 3 augment apoptosis induced by SDX-101. Importantly, SDX-101 downregulated both b-catenin and cyclin D1 expression in RPMI8226 cells. Finally, our recent studies demonstrate that the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment promotes MM cell growth, survival, and drug resistance while SDX-101 inhibits viability even if MM cells adherent to BM stromal cells; an environment in which cytotoxic potency is lost with other anti-neoplastic agents. Our data therefore demonstrate that SDX-101 induces apoptosis in MM cells via a mechanism different from conventional MM drugs, and support clinical trials of this agent, alone or in combination with conventional and/or novel agents to improve therapeutic outcome in MM.",
