    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2968 Poster Board II-944 Previously, we identified and validated PIM1 as a differentially expressed gene in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patient samples. Further, we have shown PIM1 to be a significant prognostic biomarker in MCL. PIM1 is a serine/threonine kinase that is transcriptionally regulated by cytokines, mitogens, and numerous growth factors. PIM1 cooperates with other oncogenes in tumorigenesis and has been implicated in the development of leukemias, lymphomas, late progression events, and most recently in prostate cancer. PIM1 is overexpressed in aggressive lymphomas, such as the blastoid variant of MCL, and the ABC-subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Here, we tested the in vivo cooperation of PIM1 with TCL1 in murine lymphomagenesis by producing double transgenic murine strains. PIM1 transgenic mice overexpress murine PIM1 under the control of the immunoglobulin enhancer E\u03bc. TCL1 transgenic mice (pE\u03bc-B29-TCL1) fail to down-regulate TCL1 expression in mature B and T cells and provide a unique model for mature B-cell malignancies. We hypothesized that PIM1 would either accelerate TCL1-driven lymphomagenesis, result in the development of immature lymphomas, or both. Lymphoid malignancies were examined by immunohistochemistry and classified by a hematopathologist according to \u201cMouse Models of Human Blood Cancers\u201d (Li et al., 2008). A Kaplan-Meier plot demonstrated statistically significant acceleration of lymphomagenesis in the PIM1/TCL1 transgenic mice when compared with the single transgenic strains. The median lymphoma-free survival for TCL1 single transgenic mice, PIM1 single transgenic mice, or PIM1/TCL double transgenic mice were 10.0 months, 16.0 months, and 8.5 months, respectively. The results were statistically significant: TCL1 vs. PIM1/TCL1 (p=0.0008), PIM1 vs. PIM1/TCL1 (p12 months of age) B-cell lymphomas. The most common lymphomas in PIM1 single transgenic were low-grade B-cell lymphomas [12 of 31 (38.7%)], mainly follicular lymphomas. A minority of PIM1 single transgenic mice developed aggressive lymphomas [6 of 31 (19.4%)], including DLBCL and Burkitt's lymphoma. In contrast, the majority of TCL1 transgenic mice developed aggressive B-cell lymphomas [21 of 36 (58.3%)], mainly DLBCL, lymphohistiocytic subtype. The majority of PIM1/TCL1 double transgenic mice also developed aggressive B-cell lymphomas [20 of 34 (58.8%)], mainly DLBCL, lymphohistiocytic subtype. The low-grade lymphomas that developed in PIM1/TCL1 mice included 5 cases of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL); one of these cases had transformed in addition to a DLBCL. Further, endogenous expression of PIM kinase family members was investigated in a human lymphoma cell line bank (n=40) by quantitative real-time PCR. PIM1, PIM2, and PIM3 were found to be overexpressed in cell lines derived from human lymphoid malignancies of multiple histologies. In summary, aberrant PIM1 overexpression in TCL1 transgenic mice accelerated the development of mature, aggressive B-cell lymphomas. The classification of lymphomas in PIM1/TCL1 mice revealed similar histologies as in TCL1 single transgenic mice, mainly DLBCL. Single transgenic PIM1 mice developed low-grade B-cell lymphomas after prolonged observation time. The expression of all 3 PIM kinase family members in human lymphomas implies that pan-PIM kinase inhibitors should be developed as a potential mechanism of drug resistance to more restricted PIM inhibitors could be compensatory overexpression of the non-targeted Pim family members. A clinical trial with a pan-PIM inhibitor is currently ongoing. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
