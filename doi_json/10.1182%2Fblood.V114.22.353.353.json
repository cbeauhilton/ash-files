    "abstract_text": "Abstract 353 In the setting of high-dose therapy (HDT) plus ASCT for MM, achievement of a complete (CR) or VGPR is associated with prolonged PFS and overall survival, and thus represents a major goal of treatment; in the IFM99 trials, achievement of \u2265VGPR was significantly correlated to outcome (Harousseau et al , JCO 2009, in press). We have previously reported results from the IFM2005-01 randomized phase 3 study of bortezomib (Velcade \u00ae )\u2013dexamethasone (VD) vs VAD as induction therapy prior to HDT-ASCT showing that induction with VD yields significantly higher CR and CR+VGPR rates vs VAD, both before and after HDT-ASCT (Harousseau et al , ASCO 2008). Here we report PFS overall in patients receiving VAD or VD induction, and according to post-induction and post-HDT-ASCT response (\u2265VGPR vs 3 vs \u22643 mg/L) and chromosome 13 abnormalities (del13) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Responses were evaluated post-induction and post-HDT-ASCT according to modified EBMT criteria (incorporating near-CR [nCR] and VGPR). Patients achieving <VGPR post-first HDT-ASCT (HDT-ASCT1) could receive a second HDT-ASCT or an allogeneic stem cell transplant (HDT-ASCT2). Following first or second HDT-ASCT, eligible patients could enroll into the IFM2005-02 randomized trial of consolidation and maintenance with lenalidomide vs placebo. There was no difference with regards to the proportion of VAD and VD patients who received maintenance (66.5% vs 67.4%, p=0.082). Treatment groups were generally well balanced for baseline characteristics. However, fewer VAD (12%) vs VD (17%) patients had t(4;14) and/or del17p. Moreover, more VAD (44%) vs VD (33%) patients received HDT-ASCT2 due to achieving <VGPR after HDT-ASCT1. Despite these differences in favor of the VAD group, with a median follow-up of 32.2 months, PFS appeared longer in the VD vs VAD group (36.0 vs 29.7 months; p=0.0643, or p=0.0567 if comparison adjusted for initial stratification factors). As would be expected, PFS was significantly longer in the 218 VAD+VD patients achieving \u2265VGPR after HDT-ASCT1 than in the 188 patients achieving <VGPR (median 41.1 vs 33.5 months, p=0.0257). Importantly, PFS was also significantly longer in the 125 VAD+VD patients achieving \u2265VGPR after induction than in the 357 patients achieving <VGPR (median 41.1 vs 29.0 months, p<0.001). Therefore the apparent benefit in PFS in the VD vs VAD group might be related to better initial tumor burden reduction, across all prognostic subgroups including patients with poor-risk characteristics ( Table ). Furthermore, within the VD group, there was no significant difference in PFS between patients with ISS Stage III (\u03b22M >5.5) vs Stage I/II (median 29.8 vs 36.5 months, p=0.1191), and patients with vs without t(4;14) \u00b1 del17p (median 33.5 vs 36.5 months, p=0.1655). These data suggest that induction with VD might partially overcome the poor prognosis associated with ISS Stage III MM, and presence of t(4;14) \u00b1 del17p. In conclusion, in this trial achievement of at least VGPR after induction appears to be a major prognostic factor. Apparent improvement in PFS obtained with VD vs VAD induction might be related to higher \u2265VGPR rate, across all prognostic subgroups including patients with poor-risk characteristics. Table.
