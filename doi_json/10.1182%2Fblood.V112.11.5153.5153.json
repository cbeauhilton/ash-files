    "abstract_text": "In this study, we have investigated the prognostic impact of fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) results for the chromosomal regions 1q21, 6q21, 8p21, 9p21, 13q14, 15q22, 17p13, 19q13 as well as the translocations t(4;14) and t(11;14) in patients with MM receiving ASCT. Randomly selected 65 patients were analyzed by FISH for these regions and hierarchical clustering analysis revealed associations between the occurrences of various chromosomal abnormalities. 58 patients received high-dose therapy (HDT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and 14 of these patients had monoallelic loss of the 8p21 region. Overall survivals (OS) and progression-free survivals (PFS) were significantly lower in patients with del(8p21). Moreover, multivariate analysis revealed that the occurrence del(8p21) is an independent prognostic factor for both OS and PFS. These findings suggest that the chromosomal region 8p21 could be monitored and used for the prognosis of patients with MM undergoing ASCT."
