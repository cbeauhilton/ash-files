    "abstract_text": "Background : In patients with \u03b2-thalassemia major, hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy has the potential to induce production of \u03b2-globin, \u03b3-globin or modified \u03b2-globin in the red blood cell lineage and reduce or stop the need for blood transfusions. We have previously presented early results for 2 subjects with \u03b2 0 /\u03b2 E -thalassemia major that suggested that transplantation with autologous CD34 + cells transduced with a replication-defective, self-inactivating LentiGlobin BB305 lentiviral vector containing an engineered \u03b2-globin gene (\u03b2 A-T87Q ) resulted in near-normal levels of total hemoglobin (Hb) early after HSC infusion. Herein, we provide additional follow-up data on these two subjects. Subjects and Methods : After obtaining informed consent, subjects with \u03b2-thalassemia major underwent HSC collection via peripheral blood apheresis and CD34 + cells were selected. Estimation of the mean ex- vivo vector copy number (VCN) was obtained by quantitative PCR performed on pooled colony-forming progenitors. Subjects underwent myeloablation with intravenous busulfan, followed by infusion of transduced CD34 + cells. Subjects were monitored for hematological engraftment, \u03b2 A-T87Q -globin expression (by high performance liquid chromatography) and transfusion requirements. Integration site analysis (ISA, by linear amplification-mediated PCR and high-throughput sequencing on nucleated cells) and replication-competent lentivirus (RCL) assays were performed. Results: As of 31 July 2014, two subjects with \u03b2 0/ \u03b2 E thalassemia major (Subjects 1201 and 1202) have undergone infusion with drug product. The outcome of these two subjects to date is shown in Table 1. The initial safety profile is consistent with myeloablation, without serious adverse events or drug product-related adverse events. Both subjects remain transfusion independent. ISA analyses in both the subjects at 3 months shows polyclonal reconstitution. An additional 2 subjects have been enrolled in this study but have not yet undergone drug product infusion. Conclusion: In the first two subjects, early transfusion independence was achieved and has been maintained as of 31 July 2014. Further follow up data on these two subjects and additional data on subjects who have undergone drug product infusion in this study will be presented. Gene therapy using autologous HSC transduced with LentiGlobin BB305 lentiviral vector is a promising approach for the treatment of patients with \u03b2-thalassemia major. Abstract 4797. Table 1.
