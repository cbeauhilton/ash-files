    "abstract_text": "PD-L1/PD-L2 are immunomodulatory molecules that engage with the PD-1 receptor on immune effector T and NK-cells to inhibit anti-lymphoma immunity. PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 axis molecules are prognostic in Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL, Roemer et al J Clin Oncol 2016) and Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL, Keane et al Lancet Haem 2015). Importantly, blockade of the axis is associated with particularly potent clinical responses in relapsed/refractory HL (Ansell et al NEJM 2015), as well as response in DLBCL (Armand et al J Clin Oncol 2013). Focus has been on the interaction of PD-L1 on malignant B-cells with PD-1 on HLA-class I restricted CD8+ effector T-cells. This is despite considerable evidence that: A) malignant B-cells in HL and DLBCL frequently lack the ability to present HLA-class I due to mutations in b2M and associated antigen presenting molecules (Challa-Malladi et al Cancer Cell 2013). This makes them insensitive to direct lysis by CD8+ T-cells (Zaretsky et al NEJM 2016) but potentially enhances their sensitivity to NK-cells; B) PD-L1/PD-L2 are expressed by inhibitory CD163+ monocytes/macrophages as well as by malignant B-cells (Chen et al CCR 2013). Here, we seek to establish the contribution of NK-cells and inhibitory CD163+ expressing monocytes/macrophages in the setting of HL and DLBCL. CD163/PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 gene expression was quantified by nanoString in 194 patients and was elevated in HL relative to DLBCL tissues ( P <0.01, <0.01, <0.0001, <0.0001 respectively). By FACS, intratumoral tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) demonstrate pronounced protein expression of PD-L1/PD-L2 within HL and DLBCL diseased lymph nodes (Fig A). Pre-therapy blood was tested in 114 patients. Interestingly levels in each of total monocytes, CD14+HLA-DRlo monocytoid derived suppressor cells (moMDSC) and CD163+CD14+ monocytes were equivalent between lymphoma sub-types. However, consistent with tissue findings, there was marked increase in PD-L1 expression on CD14+ monocytes, moMDSC and CD163+CD14+ monocytes in HL compared to DLBCL patients ( P <0.001, <0.0001 and 0.0086 respectively). The NK-cell marker CD56 were higher in HL compared to DLBCL tissues ( P <0.0001). Levels of PD-1 on circulating NK-cells were 7-fold elevated in HL relative to DLBCL ( P <0.0001), whereas CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell PD-1 levels were equivalent between lymphoma sub-types. NK-cells can be subdivided into CD3-CD56dimCD16+ and CD3-CD56hiCD16- subsets. The CD16- subset produces abundant cytokines but are only weakly cytotoxic before activation. Although CD16- NK-cells are typically <10% of all NK-cells in the healthy circulation, we show their relative proportion is markedly expanded by 3.5-fold in HL patients. This is of particular importance since CD16- NK-cells are enriched in secondary lymphoid tissues, i.e. the context in which lymphoma resides. Notably, CD3-CD56hiCD16- NK-cells had substantially higher PD-1 expression relative to CD3-CD56dimCD16+ cells ( P <0.0001, Fig B). A similarly aberrant NK-cell phenotype was observed in DLBCL. An in-vitro functional model of TAM-like monocytes was developed to demonstrate the potential impact of inhibitory CD163+ expressing monocytes/macrophages on NK-cells in HL and DLBCL. Monocytes were cultured with the M6 TAM inducing cytokine cocktail of M-CSF and IL-6. Consistent with an inhibitory phenotype, M6 cultured monocytes were highly enriched for CD163 ( P <0.001) and PD-L1 ( P =0.0024). Critically, M6 cultured monocytes suppressed activation of primary NK-cells in direct cytotoxicity and ADCC assays against lymphoma targets. In line with these findings, depletion of circulating monocytes from the blood of pre-therapy HL and DLBCL patients enhanced NK-cell activation relative to monocyte intact PBMC, whereas this was not observed in age/gender-matched healthy control participants. Interestingly, the increase in NK-cell activation following monocyte depletion was most pronounced in the CD16-CD56hiCD3- NK-cell subset. We describe a hitherto unrecognised immune evasion strategy mediated via skewing towards an exhausted PD-1 enriched CD16-CD56hiCD3- NK-cell phenotype. In addition to inhibition of NK-cells by the malignant B-cell, suppression of NK-cells occurs by PD-L1/PD-L2 expressing tumor associated macrophages. This mechanism is more prominent in HL than DLBCL. Figure. View large Download slide Figure. View large Download slide  Close modal Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
