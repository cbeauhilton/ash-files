    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a disease derived from genetically abnormal clonal plasma cells. MM cells aberrantly express several surface antigens compared with normal plasma cells. Among others, CD56/NCAM1 is present at variable levels in approximately 70% of MM patients. Very little is known about its role in MM; however, CD56 positivity in MM correlates with greater osteolytic burden and lower frequency of good prognostic features, such as the presence of t(11;14). We first analyzed 569 patients with MM diagnosed between 1/1/2005 and 12/31/2014 at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, stratifying them based on the percentage of CD56-expressing clonal MM cells. The mean percentage of CD56-expressing clonal MM was 26.5%, with range from 0 to 100%; the Mean Fluorescent Intensity values varied, with a quarter of patients expressing CD56 at high intensity. We then evaluated patient outcomes based on the percentage of CD56-expressing clonal MM cells. We noticed that MM patients with more than 30 or 50 percent of CD56-expressing MM clonal cells have inferior clinical outcomes than patients with less than 30 or 50 percent of CD56-expressing MM clonal cells, with median overall survival of 9.61 versus 7.64 years (log-rank p-value: 0.004) or 9.30 versus 6.47 years (log-rank p-value: 0.0009), respectively. We then demonstrated by conventional and real-time PCR analyses that the predominately expressed CD56 isoform in MM has signaling potential with a transmembrane portion and cytosolic tail. Therefore, we evaluated the functional role of CD56 in MM. By gain-of function studies in U266 and MM.1S MM cell lines, we showed that overexpression of CD56 promotes MM growth and viability; the opposite effect occurred with CD56 silencing in H929, OPM-2, and RPMI-8226 MM cell lines, which leads to reduced MM growth and increased apoptotic cell death. Overexpression of CD56 resulted in the phosphorylation and hence activation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase A3 (RSK2) and of the transcription factor, cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1). This induced CREB1 binding to DNA consensus CRE elements, and promoted transcription of CREB1 targets, the anti-apoptotic genes BCL2 and MCL1. CD56 silencing in H929 and OPM-2 MM cell lines had opposite effects, with reduction of phospho-RSK2, phospho-CREB1, MCL1, and BCL2 levels. We then used shRNAs targeting RSK2 and CREB1 or specific inhibitors (BI-D1870 that is a RSK2 inhibitor, and 666-15 that is a CREB1 inhibitor) at 0.1-1 microM concentration. We evaluated viability by MTT assay or Zombie dye staining on CD138 positive MM cells and apoptosis by Annexin V-PI staining. We demonstrated that CD56 positive MM cell lines (H929, OPM-2, and RPMI-8226) or patients with high CD56 expression (>30% of CD56-expressing clonal MM cells) are more sensitive to RSK2/CREB1 inhibition compared with CD56 negative MM cell lines (U266, L363, and MM.1S) or patients with low CD56 expression (<30% of CD56-expressing clonal MM cells). Using similar strategies, we also proved that CREB1 is essential to CD56-protumoral phenotype, since CREB1 inhibition reduces cellular growth and viability in CD56 overexpressing U266 cells. RSK2 and CREB1 inhibition mimic CD56 silencing with decrease of BCL2 and MCL1 mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, we observed that CD56 signaling by CREB1 activation decreases CRBN expression, reducing responses to lenalidomide. Conversely, CREB1/RSK2 blockade rescued CRBN levels in CD56 positive MM cells and increased lenalidomide response. These results support the hypothesis that targeting CREB1 is hence a so far unexplored but potentially effective synthetic lethal strategy for CD56-expressing MM patients. In conclusion, our study defines an effective threshold for therapeutic intervention in CD56-expressing MM patients. Moreover, our data pioneer the use of CREB1/RSK2 inhibition in CD56-expressing MM cells, either as single agents or in combination with lenalidomide, suggesting that CD56 can be a prognostic and predictive factor of response in MM.
