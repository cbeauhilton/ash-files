    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Proteasomes are the chief degradation components of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and are comprised of several (\ud835\udf36) structural and (\u00df) catalytic subunits. Targeting the \u00df5 subunit, with agents such bortezomib (Btz, 20S proteasome inhibitor, PI) has proven highly successful in MM pts. However, resistance to Btz (Btz-R) invariably ensues with disease evolution resulting in relapse and mortality. Our data highlight that in Btz-R cells, proteasome function is upregulated with increased reliance on other \u00df-catalytic subunits. We have uncovered a novel association between the \u00df5 subunit acting in concert with the \u00df1i proteasome subunit, to promote resistance to Btz. We hypothesized that targeting \u00df5 and \u00df1i together would be lethal to Btz-R MM cells. Methods: CD138+ cells from MM patients, Btz-sensitive (Btz-S) MM cell lines (OPM2, KMS11 and U266) and their isogenic Btz-R subclones were used in experiments. Fluorogenic peptide substrates were used to measure \u00df-subunit-specific enzymatic activity. Gene disruption was conducted using 2 different shRNA hairpins for PSMB5 (\u00df5) and PSMB9 (\u00df9). Affymetrix HT12v4 gene expression array and NanoString mRNA quantification were used for gene expression profiling (GEP), followed by qPCR for confirmation. Novel dual \u00df5-\u00df1i PI were synthesized and tested in vitro. Apoptosis was determined by annexin-V/PI staining and MTS/CellTiter Glo assay used to determine cell viability. Results: Btz IC50 was noted to be 284nM in Btz-R vs. 4nM in Btz-S cells. Sanger seq. revealed no mutations in PSMB5 indicating that Btz should effectively bind the \u00df5 subunit. \u00df-subunit chymotrypic activity in Btz-R vs. Btz-S cells was significantly increased (3.5 fold, p2-fold increase in CASP8, CASP9, CASP10, CDKN2A, CDKN1A , TNFRSF10B, FOXO4 and RNF43 (apoptosis genes) and decrease in CCB1, CCNA2, WNT5A, SKP2, CDC6 and FEN1 (cell cycle genes) vs. scramble-transfected controls. Indeed, both Btz-S and Btz-R MM cells demonstrated significantly compromised growth capacity and viability (Dual knockdown \u00df5/\u00df1i Btz-R cells: 0.32 million/mL vs. scramble Btz-R cells: 1.6 million/mL) (Fig 1). This prompted us to develop novel dual-\u00df5 and \u00df1i chemical inhibitors. Using a highly modified carbamate scaffold we developed 20 cmpds that display binding affinity for both \u00df5 and \u00df1i. In vitro screening of the top 5 cmpds showed >2 fold lower EC50 in Btz-R vs. Btz-S MM cell lines. 2 cmpds in particular showed \u00df1i and \u00df5 enzymatic inhibition of >50% at 1uM and 5uM, respectively and are being further optimized. Conclusions: We have found that upregulation of PSMB9/\u00df1i and PSMB5/\u00df5 is associated with resistance to Btz. These findings were confirmed in both MM cell lines as well as in primary MM cells from Btz-R pts. Moreover, increased PSMB9 mRNA expression in non-responding Btz+Dex pts. but not Len+dex MM pts. highlights this as a resistance mechanism unique to Btz. Direct genetic disruption or with novel dual-chemical inhibitors directed toward \u00df1i and \u00df5 induced lethality in Btz-R (as well as Btz-S) MM cells. Thus, our investigations point to development of agents, which inhibit \u00df1i and \u00df5-proteasome subunits to overcome resistance to Btz.
