    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1763 Primary myelofibrosis (PMF), myelofibrosis post essential thrombocytosis (MF-ET), and myelofibrosis post polycythemia vera (MF-PV) have been reported to be associated with autoimmune phenomena, such as Coombs positive anemia, lupus anticoagulant, positive ANA and the presence of circulating immune complex, etc. Regulatory T cells (T reg ) and IL-17 producing cells (Th17) have been known to play important roles in modulating immune responses. Hence we studied T reg cells in 38 patients with MF including PMF (25), MF-ET (8), MF-PV (5) and compared them to other MPD patients including ET (7), PV (14), and normal controls (16). Patients on lenalidomide or Pomalidomide were excluded. Blood ( 10 6 MNCs) were stained for flow cytometry analysis using the T reg Detection Kit (Miltenyi Biotec). The number of T reg cells was calculated as the percentage of positive CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + T cells from the number of gated CD4 + cells. T reg function was evaluated by XTT cell proliferation assay (Invitrogen) with ratios of T reg to T-effector cells at 1:1 in the presence of anti-CD3 and CD28 micro-beads (Invitrogen). The results (mean + SE) showed numbers of T reg cells in MF were 0.79 + 0.080, other MPD were 1.27 + 0.20, and normal controls were 1.21 + 0.30. No significant difference was found among the three groups. T reg function was evaluated in MF (18 patients). MPD (21) and controls (16). No significant difference was found among the three groups. Th17 cell assays were performed by culturing Blood CD4 + cells in IMDM medium and stimulated with PMA (25ng/ml), ionomycin (1 ug/ml ) and monensin ( 500ng/ml) for 4h at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . Then Th17 was stained with Th17 Flow Kit (Biolegend) and analyzed by flow cytometry. The results were expressed as % of isolated CD4 + cells (mean \u00b1 SE) as follows: MF (2.31 \u00b1 0.65) (n=15), MPD (1.31 \u00b1 0.32) (n=7), and controls (1.89 \u00b1 0.44) (n=10). No significant difference was found among the three groups. We further studied the soluble interleukin 2 alpha subunit (sIL2\u03b1) levels. sIL2 \u03b1 were measured in plasma by ELISA kits, results were expressed as (mean\u00b1 SE ) ( pg/ml) as follows: MF ( 3534\u00b1 298) (n=18), MPD ( 2303 \u00b1 171) (n=22) and controls ( 1734 \u00b1 115) (n=16), P values were < 0.05 in MF vs MPD and MF vs Controls, and P = NS in MPD Vs controls. These results confirm our previous observation (Br J Haematol,1994), that sIL2 \u03b1 levels were significantly elevated in patients with MF, compared with MPD patients and controls. We further studied the effects of the sIL2\u03b1 on the immune function in MF patients: A) Effects on the Th1, Th17, and T reg cells . CD4 + cells after isolation were cultured for 7 days in IMDM containing IL-2 (100ug/ml) and anti- CD3CD28 micro-beads, with or without recombinant sIL-2R\u03b1 (100ng/ml). The cells then were stimulated with PMA (20ng/ml) ionomycin (1ug/ml) and monensin (1uM) for 4 hours before harvest. Then Th1 Th17 and T reg were numerated by flow cytometry. The results showed no difference in Th1 and Th17 cells in cultures with and without sIL2\u03b1, but sIL2\u03b1 significantly increased the numbers of T reg (1.71 +.28,P=0.02) ( fold increase). B) Effects on the T reg function . Viable CD4 + CD25 \u2212 (10 6 ) cells were labeled with CFSE ( Invitrogen), then added unlabeled T regs at 1:1 (responder: T reg ) ratio and stimulated with 50 \u03bcl of anti CD3/CD28 micro-beads with and without sIL2\u03b1 for 4 \u20137days at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cell proliferation was measured by counting the percentage of CFSE dim cells. The results showed that sIL2\u03b1 significantly increased the CFSE dim cells. Therefore sIL2\u03b1 suppressd the T reg cell function and increase the T responsive cell proliferation. C) Identification of cells producing sIL2\u03b1 . CD4 + , CD14 + , CD8 + , CD20 + , and T reg were isolated using isolation kits (Miltenyi ), then cultured either with PHA or anti CD3/CD28 micro-beads. ELISA assay for sIL2\u03b1 were then performed on the cultured supernatant. The results (mean \u00b1 SE) ( pg/ml) showed that CD4 + cells produced 342 \u00b1152.6; CD8 + ,71.6 \u00b1 19.8; T reg , 306.9 \u00b1 53.5, while CD14 + and CD20 + cells produced negligible quantity of sIL2\u03b1. Thus T reg cells were the cells predominantly producing sIL2\u03b1 in patients with MF. We conclude that in patients with MF, numbers of T reg and Th17 cells were not different from controls or other MPD patients, but T reg cells produce significantly increased amount of sIL2\u03b1 which further inhibits T reg function and results in autoimmune phenomenon observed in patients with MF.
