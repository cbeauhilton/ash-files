    "abstract_text": "The FDG-PET/CT scan has become a standard tool in the management of NHL. Failure to achieve an early metabolic CR (mCR) is associated with a poor outcome and this information can be used to modify subsequent management. However, several issues still need to be resolved, including: 1-What is the best time to perform a post-treatment PET scan? Is very early (i.e. 1 week) after the first chemotherapy superior to the traditional 3 rd course PET scan? 2-What criteria can we use to define mCR? Is there an SUV threshold on the very early PET scan that best defines mCR? In order to answer these questions we designed a study in which patients with histologically aggressive NHLs had 3 sequential PET scans: 1 st one at baseline, a 2 nd one on week 1 after the 1 st course of chemotherapy (W 1 PET ) and the 3 rd one after course 3 of chemotherapy (C 3 PET ). We have entered 32 patients of which 30 are currently assessable. Histologies were: DLCL=26, FLCL=4. IPI was \u22652 in 69%. At baseline, median SUV max =17.14 (range 5.6\u201347.1). In the 30 cases who had a W 1 PET, the mean SUV max dropped to 4.4 (0.7\u201321.3, corrected for background). In the 24 who have completed their C 3 PET the mean SUV max was 1.55 (0\u201315.2) and only 6 patients had an SUV >0: 0.9, 3.7, 3.9, 5.1, 8.3, 15.2. We then examined the correlation between the SUV max of W 1 PET with SUV max of C 3 PET . 24 cases have already had both a W 1 PET and a C 3 PET. Table 1 shows that the W 1 PET correlated well with 17 (71%) of the 24 C 3 PETs. All 14 who achieved SUV max <4.0 on W 1 PET had an SUV max <4.0 on C 3 PET (all of the latter achieved SUVs <1.0). However, of 10 cases who failed to attain SUVmax <4.0 on W 1 PET, 7 went on to achieve SUV max <4.0 on C 3 PET, and 2 of these 7 relapsed. For the purpose of determining the best SUV cut-off that can be used to define mCR, we examined the failure free survival (FFS) at various cut-offs ranging from 0 to 8.0 for both W 1 PETs and C 3 PETs . The best cut-off for both W 1 PET and C 3 PET was observed at 4.0 (table 2). We thus defined mCR as a post-treatment SUV max <4.0. Those who achieved mCR on the W 1 PET had a significantly superior FFS (Kaplan-Meier method) than those who didn\u2019t reach mCR (table 2). The results for the C 3 PET didn\u2019t reach statistical significance (table 2). Conclusions: 1- Striking improvements in the PET scan are seen as early as 1 week after the first chemotherapy course. 2-The results of the W 1 PET anticipated correctly 71% of C 3 PET results. 3- Patients who attained an SUV max <4.0 on the W 1 PET had a remarkably superior outcome than those with SUV max \u22654.0 and was associated with a 91% FFS. Thus an SUV cut-off of <4.0 at W 1 PET can be used to define mCR. This finding should be confirmed in an independent set of patients. 4- The W 1 PET is more sensitive and specific than the C 3 PET and is preferable to the C 3 PET in predicting clinical outcome.
