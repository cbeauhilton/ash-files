    "abstract_text": "The blood clot or thrombus is composed of red blood cells, platelets and white cells that interact with the fibrin meshwork produced by the coagulation system. The red blood cells form polyhedrocytes that seal the clot, platelets provide forces for clot contraction, and white cells contribute neutrophil extracellular traps, cytokines and complement activation. The fibrin network contributes clot elasticity and provides the proteinaceous backbone structure that stabilises the clot. Previous studies from our laboratory and others have shown that dense fibrin networks demonstrating small pores and increased resistance to fibrinolysis associate with thrombosis. However, the mechanisms underpinning this have not been fully understood. Recent studies using atomic force microscopy from our laboratory have shown that fibrinogen interacts with red cells with comparable affinity as that with platelets. A patient with mutations in the \u03b23 integrin subunit showed no binding between red cells and fibrinogen, demonstrating that a \u03b23-related integrin receptor is involved in the interaction. Mutations in the fibrinogen \u03b1-chain integrin binding sites (D97E and D574E) reduced frequency of red cell interactions with fibrinogen. Interestingly, a naturally occuring splice variant of the fibrinogen \u03b3-chain that reduces binding to the platelets, fibrinogen \u03b3', increased binding interactions between fibrinogen and red blood cells. Fibrinogen \u03b3' is a naturally occurring splice variant of fibrinogen, in which the C-terminal AGDV residues of the more common \u03b3A-chain (85%) are replaced with a negatively charched VRPEHPAETEYDSLYPEDDL sequence of the \u03b3' chain (15%). Fibrinogen \u03b3' induced clustering of fibrin fibres into tightly interknit nuclei of fibrin fibres, interspersed by large pores that extend over more than 50 \u03bcm within the fibrin network structure. The effects of fibrinogen \u03b3' on fibrin clot structure was independent of thrombin and FXIII as demonstrated using snake venom enzyme. Previously we showed impaired fibrin protofibril formation with fibrinogen \u03b3' using atomic force microscopy. Using turbidimetric analysis of fibrin intrafibrillar structure, we show that fibrinogen \u03b3' reduces protofibil packing per fibrin fiber. Furthermore, we find that reduced protofibril packing diminishes fibrin stiffness as analysed with magnetic tweezers both in purified systems as well as in plasma at (patho)physiological fibrinogen \u03b3' levels that range from 3-40%, and in whole blood as analysed with thromboelastography. In conclusion, our data show that red blood cells and fibrinogen \u03b3' play major roles in the regulation of clot structure and stability, and that these effects on clot structure are major determinants of the functional properties of the blood clot. Modulating fibrin clot structure and its interactions with blood cells may represent major new targets for the treatment of thrombosis. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
