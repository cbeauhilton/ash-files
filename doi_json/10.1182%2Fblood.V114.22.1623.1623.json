    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1623 Poster Board I-649 Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities are detected in approximately 50% of patients with primary MDS and have a strong impact on disease outcome. More prevalent are unbalanced chromosomal aberrations reflecting a gain or loss of genetic material, whereas balanced rearrangements are rather rare. The most recurrent structural karyotypic abnormality is an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 occurring in 30% of primary MDS cases, either as isolated aberration (10%) or combined with additional cytogenetic changes (20%). An isolated del(5q) is generally associated with a better prognosis, whereas patients with one or more additional chromosomal abnormalities have a significantly shorter overall survival. The worst prognosis is observed in patients with del(5q) occurring in the context of a complex chromosomal aberrations (CCA; 3 3 abnormalities). Identifications of chromosomal regions involved in CCA in patients with MDS is very important and could yield detection of cryptic, recurrent, prognostically relevant aberrations and identification of candidate genes involved especially in progression of the disease. Detailed molecular cytogenetic analyses of CCA might lead to better understanding of molecular etiology of MDS with its therapeutic consequences. The aim of this study was to assess prognostic relevance of CCA in a cohort of patients with primary MDS and del(5q), to evaluate involvement of specific chromosomes and/or chromosomal regions in CCA and to establish the exact localization of chromosomal breakpoints. During 2002 and 2009, we examined bone marrow samples of 720 adults with MDS. Out of these, a total of 70 patients with primary disease and del(5q) associated with the CCA were identified at the time of initial diagnosis - 32 women (46%) and 38 men (54%), with a median age of 66 years (range 22 - 83). Diagnoses according to the WHO classification were as follows: RA (3%), RCMD (14%), RAEB I (27%), RAEB II (35%), MDS-AML (17%), CMML (3%) and MDS-U (1%). For precise analyses of chromosomal regions and breakpoints involved in CCA, various modifications of molecular cytogenetic techniques were used: FISH with locus specific probes (Abbott Vysis), CGH, mFISH/mBAND (MetaSystems) and/or array CGH (BlueGnome, NimbleGene). In 40 cases, mFISH analyses showed that parts of deleted chromosome 5 were translocated to other chromosomes. Fragmentation of 5q was also frequently found. Interestingly, no patient with monosomy 5 was identified in this study. Even in patients with suspect monosomy 5 detected by conventional cytogenetics, further detailed molecular cytogenetic analyses revealed parts of chromosome 5 material were retained in means of insertions within CCA. The most recurrent partners of del(5q) in unbalanced translocations were chromosomes 12 (23%), 3 (21%) and 17 (21%). The most common chromosome 5 breakpoints were 5q33 (47%), 5q13 (39%) and 5q11 (13%), the most frequently encountered deletion was q13q33 (30%). Except the chromosome 5, most often in CCA involved chromosomes were 17 (53%), 12 (49%), 7 (47%), 3 (43%) and 11 (31%), and the most recurrent breakpoints were at regions 12p11 (16%), 7q11 (10%), 7q21 (9%) and 7p11 (9%). Finding of CCA at diagnosis were associated with poor response to the therapy and short overall survival (median 4 months). Patients were classified into two groups according to the results of molecular cytogenetic analyses: group A (n=30) \u2013 del(5q) and additional CCA, and group B (n=40) \u2013 deleted chromosome 5 involved in CCA. The shortest overall survival was found in group B (median 3 months versus 5 months in group A). In conclusion, the involvement of specific chromosomes and/or chromosomal regions in CCA associated with del(5q) is nonrandom. Deleted chromosome 5 is very unstable and is often involved in different types of cryptic unbalanced rearrangements (translocation, insertions). Monosomy of chromosome 5, quoted in the literature, does not actually exist in MDS. Patients with del(5q) involved in CCA should be considered as a unique entity with extremely poor prognosis.
