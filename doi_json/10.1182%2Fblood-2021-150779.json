    "abstract_text": "Introduction: UCART22 is a genetically modified allogeneic T-cell product manufactured from non-HLA matched healthy donor cells. Donor-derived T-cells are transduced using a lentiviral vector to express the anti-CD22 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR; anti-CD22 scFv-41BB-CD3\u03b6) and are further modified using Cellectis' TALEN \u00ae technology to disrupt the T-cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC) and CD52 genes to minimize risk of graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) and allow use of anti-CD52-directed drugs for lymphodepletion (LD). Preliminary results from the phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation BALLI-01 study (NCT04150497) in patients (pts) with R/R B-ALL showed that UCART22 is tolerable and shows anti-leukemic activity after LD with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) (Jain, ASH 2020). Host T-cell recovery was observed in all pts between days (d) 7-28. Subsequent UCART22 dose-finding cohorts utilized a new LD regimen that included the addition of alemtuzumab to FC (\"FCA\"), which could potentially deepen and sustain host T-cell depletion and promote CAR T-cell expansion and persistence. Methods: Eligibility criteria include age 15\u201270 yrs, adequate organ function, ECOG PS \u2264 1, B-ALL blast CD22 expression \u2265 70% by flow cytometry. Pts must have received \u2265 1 prior standard chemotherapy regimen and 1 salvage regimen. After LD with FCA (F 30 mg/m 2 \u00d7 3d, C 0.5 g/m 2 \u00d7 3d, A 20 mg/d \u00d7 3d), pts receive a single infusion of UCART22 at ~1 \u00d710 6 cells/kg (FCA-DL2) or ~2.5 \u00d710 6 cells/kg (FCA-DL2i). The primary endpoint is the safety, tolerability, and MTD of UCART22. DLTs are assessed over a 28d observation period after UCART22 infusion. Additional endpoints include anti-leukemic activity per investigator assessment (NCCN criteria), and the expansion, trafficking, and persistence of UCART22 (assessed in peripheral blood [PB] and bone marrow [BM] by phenotypic analysis using flow cytometry and vector copy number [VCN] using qPCR). Immune reconstitution is assessed by flow cytometry. Results: As of 01 July 2021, a total of 13 pts had provided consent: 3 failed screening, 1 discontinued after LD, and 9 pts received UCART22. Enrollment in FC-DL1 (n = 3), FC-DL2 (n = 2), and FCA-DL2 (n = 3) was complete, and 1 pt had been enrolled in FCA-DL2i. All 3 pts in FCA-DL2 (median age 29 yrs [range 29\u201251]; 1 male) had discontinued at data cutoff and 1 remained in long-term follow-up. Pts had received a median of 5 (4-6) prior Tx, including blinatumomab for all 3 pts, inotuzumab for 2 pts, autologous CAR19 Tx for 1 pt. Median BM blast percentage prior to LD was 92% (88-98). One pt in FCA-DL2 had Tx-related TEAEs of G1 CRS (requiring a single administration of tocilizumab) and G2 pruritus; both events resolved. Two pts had serious TEAEs not related to UCART22 or FCA: 1 pt had G3 hyperbilirubinemia and febrile neutropenia and 1 pt had G1 pyrexia. No pts had GvHD, ICANS, or protocol-defined DLTs. Two pts experienced 4 infectious TEAEs (BK virus [G1 n = 1], candida infection [G2 n = 2], CMV infection [G1 n = 1]). No G \u22653 infections were reported. One pt had a blast reduction consistent with CRi (from 97% to 0.4%; ANC 1.07 \u00d710 9 /L), and 1 pt had a significant blast reduction from 92% to 27%. Host lymphocytes remained suppressed throughout the 28d DLT observation period for all 3 pts in the FCA-DL2 cohort, correlating with UCART22 proliferation and > 2-fold increases in inflammatory cytokines (including IL-6, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3, and CRP) in 2 pts ( Figure ). In 1 pt, peak UCART22 was detected in PB by flow cytometry on d9 (11 cells/\u00b5L) and by VCN on d14 (91 copies/100 cells), and in BM on d14 (5 cells/\u00b5L; 56 copies/100 cells); in the second pt, UCART22 was detected in PB by flow cytometry and VCN on d11 (5 cells/ \u00b5L; 0.83 copies/100 cells). Conclusions: The FCA LD regimen was well tolerated and associated with extended host lymphocyte suppression and UCART22 expansion. No Tx-related serious TEAEs were reported at FCA-DL2, and 2 pts achieved significant blast reductions. Detection of UCART22 occurred as early as d9 after infusion and was associated with increases in inflammatory cytokines. Overall, these data support the safety and activity of UCART22 after FCA LD in pts with R/R B-ALL. Enrollment in the FCA-DL2i cohort is ongoing and updated data will be presented at the meeting.
