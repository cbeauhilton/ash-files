    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-23 Besides serving as a prosthetic group for hemoglobin, heme also regulates translation by inhibiting the kinase activity of heme-regulated translational inhibitor (HRI). HRI is the only known protein kinase that senses the intracellular heme concentration and does so through its two heme-binding domains. HRI is activated in heme deficiency by autophosphorylation, and phosphorylates the \u03b1-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1), which impairs the recycling of eIF2 for further translational initiation and results in cessation of protein synthesis. In this manner, HRI serves as a feedback inhibitor and coordinates the translation of globin mRNAs with the intracellular heme concentration to ensure that globin proteins are not made in excess of the heme available for the formation of hemoglobin. Excess of globin chains or heme is cytotoxic. In the absence of HRI, uncontrolled protein synthesis in heme deficiency results in globin aggregation and precipitation in red blood cells and their precursors. HRI is responsible for the physiological adaptation that produces hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes in iron deficiency. The expression of HRI was increased during late stages of erythropoiesis with higher expression in Ter119 high erythroblasts and reticulocytes, correlating with the active synthesis and regulation of globins at these stages of erythroid differentiation. In addition to inhibiting global protein synthesis, the second important function of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is to reprogram translation and the subsequent transcription of genes required for stress response. In mammalian cells, translation of the transcription factor ATF4 mRNA is upregulated specifically by eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation via upstream open reading frames in the 5\u2019UTR. Activation of the HRI-ATF4 stress response pathway in nucleated erythroid precursors is required for adaptation to acute and chronic oxidative stress. Furthermore, this HRI-dependent ATF4 pathway is also operative and necessary for erythroid differentiation, especially under stress conditions. In chronic iron deficiency, HRI is necessary for adaptive gene expression for erythroid differentiation as well as for iron heme and redox homeostasis. Beyond heme deficiency and oxidative stress, HRI is also activated by osmotic shock and heat shock. HRI deficiency in mice exacerbates erythropoietic protoporphyria and renders \u03b2-thalassemia intermedia embryonically lethal. Hri \u2212/\u2212 mice also develop ineffective erythropoiesis during iron/heme deficiency and are severely compromised upon phenylhydrazine-induced acute hemolytic anemia. Thus, translational regulation by HRI plays a critical role in the manifestation of red cell diseases in mice and may be a significant modifier of such diseases in humans.
