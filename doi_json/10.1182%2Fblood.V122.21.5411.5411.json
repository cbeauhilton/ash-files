    "abstract_text": "The basis for persistence of leukemic stem cells in the bone marrow microenvironment (BMME) remains poorly understood. We present evidence that signaling crosstalk between \u03b14 integrin and Abelson interactor-1 (Abi1) is involved in acquisition of an anchorage-dependent phenotype and drug resistance in Bcr-Abl positive leukemia cells. Comparison of Abi1 (ABI1) and \u03b14 integrin (ITGA4) gene expression in relapsing Bcr-Abl positive CD34+ progenitor cells demonstrated a reduction in Abi1 and an increase in \u03b14 integrin mRNA in the absence of Bcr-Abl mutations. This inverse correlation between Abi1 and \u03b14 integrin expression, as well as linkage to elevated phospho-Akt and phospho-Erk signaling, was confirmed in imatinib mesylate (IM) resistant leukemic cells. These results indicate that the \u03b14-Abi1 signaling pathway may mediate acquisition of the drug resistant phenotype of leukemic cells. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
