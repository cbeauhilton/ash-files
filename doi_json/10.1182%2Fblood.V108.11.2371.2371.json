    "abstract_text": "NFAT is a family of highly phosphorylated proteins residing in the cytoplasm of resting cells. Upon dephosphorylation by the Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent serine phosphatase calcineurin, NFAT translocates to the nucleus, where it induces the transcription of a large number of genes necessary for a productive immune response. NFAT signalling has also been implicated in lymphocyte homeostasis and its deregulation has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of different malignancies. A recent immunohistochemical evaluation of approximately 300 Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma biopsy samples showed overexpression of NFAT2 in the majority of specimens with strong nuclear translocation in certain histologic subtypes (DLBCL, Burkitt\u2019s Lymphoma) presumably reflecting activation of the NFAT pathway as part of their pathogenesis. Other recent studies have shown that NFAT activation leads to increased expression of different cell survival factors (CD154, BLyS) in several lymphoma subtypes (DLBCL, MCL). To study the role of constitutive activation of the NFAT pathway on lymphomagenesis, we generated several hyperactivable NFAT mutants which will be used to generate transgenic mice expressing the mutant proteins from the ROSA26 locus. Here, we present the in vitro characterization of these hyperactivable NFAT proteins in cell lines and primary lymphocytes. The major docking site for calcineurin is located at the N terminus of the NFAT regulatory domain and has the consensus sequence PxIxIT (e.g. SPRIEIT in NFAT1 and NFAT2). Substitution of the SPRIEIT sequence of NFAT with HPVIVIT, a higher-affinity version obtained by peptide selection, increases the basal calcineurin sensitivity of the protein significantly. Similarly, a major kinase for NFAT is CK1, and mutation of the CK1 docking site (FSILF to ASILA in NFAT1, FDFEF to ADAEA in NFAT2) also leads to partial nuclear localization of NFAT proteins by decreasing rephosphorylation and nuclear export. In the current analysis we compared the different hyperactivable NFAT proteins with respect to dephosphorylation status and nuclear translocation using western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Whereas the wildtype NFAT protein was entirely localized in the cytoplasm and completely phosphorylated under resting conditions, we observed an increasing degree of nuclear translocation and dephosphorylation for the different mutant proteins (ASILA 20%, VIVIT 30\u201340%, ASILA-VIVIT 50\u201370%). This system will allow us to study the impact of different levels of NFAT activation on the pathogenesis of lymphomas in vivo.",
