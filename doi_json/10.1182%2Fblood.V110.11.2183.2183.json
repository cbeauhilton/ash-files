    "abstract_text": "Immunotherapy with allodepleted donor T-cells generated using a CD25 immunotoxin improves immune reconstitution after haplo-SCT, but leukaemic relapse remains a problem. To develop a rational approach to refining allodepletion, we characterised the phenotype of proliferating alloreactive T cells flow cytometrically. CFSE-labelled T cells were co-cultured with HLA-mismatched dendritic cells and serial FACS analyses performed to determine expression of CD25, CD69, CD71, HLA-DR, OX40, ICOS, CD95, CD45RA, CCR7, IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and IL\u20132. By staining each sample with CD3, CFSE and CD25 we were able to determine the phenotype of proliferating CD25 negative alloreactive T cells. In 5 donors, after a 3 day culture, CD25 was expressed in a mean of 83% (range 67\u201389%) of the proliferating (CFSE-dim) alloreactive T cells, confirming CD25 as an excellent target for allodepletion. 70% (39\u201381%) of the proliferating alloreactive CD25 \u2013ve population expressed CD71, and 62% (50\u201374%) expressed CD45RA, identifying these as markers to target alloreactive T-cells that would persist after CD25 based allodepletion. To optimize our CD25 based allodepletion, we compared allodepletion using a CD25 immunotoxin or immunomagnetic beads in 6 HLA mismatched donor-recipient pairs. There was no significant difference between residual alloreactivity to host in primary and secondary MLRs and IFN\u03b3 ELISPOT assays. We then compared CD25 vs CD25/71 immunomagnetic depletion in 8 HLA-mismatched donor-recipient pairs. Rested allodepleted cells were restimulated with host or 3rd party stimulators in 2\u00b0 proliferation or IFN\u03b3 ELISPOT assays. The median residual reactivity to host in IFN\u03b3 ELISPOT assays was significantly lower after combined CD25/71 than CD25 allodepletion (14.1% vs 54.6%, p < 0.05). Likewise, in 2\u00b0 MLRs, CD25/71 depletion resulted in significantly lower residual proliferative response to host than CD25 depletion (median 4.8% of the response of unmanipulated PBMC vs 9.9%, p < 0.01). Third party responses after CD25/71 allodepletion were equivalent to unmanipulated PBMCs from the same donors in both assays. CD25/71 allodepletion also gave lower residual responses to host in both assays than combined CD25/45RA allodepletion. In IFN\u03b3 ELISPOT assays, anti-viral responses to CMV and EBV were preserved after combined CD25/71 allodepletion (CMV: unmanipulated 151 spots vs.CD25/71 123 spots, EBV unmanipulated 100 spots vs. CD25/71 142 spots).Similarly, the frequency of CD8 +CMV and EBV\u2013specific T-cells assessed by pentamer analysis was not significantly reduced compared to unmanipulated PBMCs. We conclude that CD25/71 allodepletion will selectively delete 94% of the proliferating alloreactive T cells and enhances the depletion of alloreactivity compared with CD25-based methods. This strategy may facilitate immunotherapy with larger doses of allodepleted donor T-cells after haplo-SCT, enhancing graft versus leukaemia and antiviral effects.",
