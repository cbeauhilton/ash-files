    "abstract_text": "The prognosis of follicular lymphoma (FL) patients is suspected to be influenced by tumor infiltrating regulatory T cells (Tregs). The mechanism of Tregs enrichment in FL and their impact on malignant FL B cells remains to be elucidated. We analyzed 46 fresh lymph node biopsy samples including FL (n = 20), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL; n = 10), classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL; n = 9) and reactive lymphadenitis (rL; n = 7). Using multicolor flow cytometry and cell sorting, we observed an accumulation of CD25 high CD127 low/ - Tregs in FL tissues. These Tregs comprised activated ICOS + Tregs which were able to suppress not only conventional T cells, but also FL B cells. These FL B cells were able to express ICOSL in vitro and to generate CD25 high Foxp3 high Tregs expressing ICOS. Tregs generation was associated with ICOS/ICOSL engagement and was abrogated by antagonist anti-ICOS and anti-ICOSL antibodies. Interaction between Tregs and FL B cells resulted in ICOSL downregulation on FL B cells. These data highlight the role of Tregs in FL pathogenesis and suggest that targeting the ICOS/ICOSL pathway may be a promising immunotherapy in FL Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
