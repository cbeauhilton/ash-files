    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2539 Introduction: T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a rare mature post-thymic T-cell neoplasm with aggressive clinical course and a median overall survival of less than one year. Due to the rareness of this disease (\u223c2% of cases of mature lymphocytic leukemias in adults) only few cases with cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations have been reported so far. However, almost 75% of T-PLL cases are reported to harbor chromosome 14 abnormalities involving the TCRA/D locus resulting in the aberrant activation of the proto-oncogenes TCL1A or MTCP1 . Aim: Perform a comprehensive cytogenetic and molecular characterization of T-PLL. Patient and Methods: The cohort comprised 36 T-PLL cases diagnosed between 10/2005 and 07/2012 (23 male, 13 female patients). Median age was 71.0 yrs (range: 26.8\u201382.8 yrs). According to the WHO classification all T-PLL cases were characterized using immunophenotyping and cytomorphology. Patients were further investigated using chromosome banding analysis (CBA) (n=30), FISH for deletions of ATM (n=30), TP53 (n=29), and 13q (n=26), and CGH arrays (n=3, Human CGH 6\u00d7630K Whole-Genome Tiling Array, Roche NimbleGen, Madison, WI). Further, mutation analyses for BCOR and TP53 were performed using amplicon sequencing (Roche 454, Branford, CT). Results: Aberrant karyotypes were observed by CBA in 25/30 cases (83.3%). However, the 5 remaining cases with normal karyotype were due to insufficient proliferation of the T-PLL clone as gains, losses and rearrangements were detected in these 5 cases using FISH analyses. In more detail, combined CBA and FISH data revealed in 20/30 (66.7%) cases an inv(14)(q11q32)/t(14;14)(q11;q32)/ TCRA/D-TCL1A (n=18) or t(X;14)(q27;q11)/ TCRA/D-MTCP1 (n=2). Further, a gain of chromosome 8q and concomitant loss of 8p was observed in 13/30 (43.3%) cases. In addition, in 10/25 (40.0%) cases a 6q deletion and in 7/25 (28.0%) an 12p deletion were observed. Based on FISH data, deletions were detected of ATM in 19/30 (63.3%) cases, TP53 in 7/29 (24.1%), and 13q in 9/26 (34.6%) cases. In addition, 3 cases were studied using array CGH. Hereby, an intragenic deletion in the BCOR gene was observed in one patient. BCOR is a BCL6 corepressor and located on chromosome Xp11.4. BCOR mutations were recently described in cases with AML. BCOR mutation frequency was determined at 3.8% in AML with normal karyotype and mutations were associated with shorter overall and event-free survival. The deletion in BCOR identified in one of our cases and the TP53 deletions in 7 T-PLL cases prompted us to screen 35 cases for molecular mutations in these two genes. Overall, BCOR mutations were detected in 5/35 (14.3%) patients and TP53 mutations in 4/35 (11.4%) cases. In total, 7 missense, one frame-shift and one nonsense mutations were found. Median mutation load was 90.0% for BCOR (range: 38\u2013100%) and 80.0% (59\u201387%) for TP53 . Next, we performed correlation analyses between mutations in BCOR and TP53 , rearrangements involving chromosome 14, deletions of ATM , TP53 , 6q, 12p, and 13q and gain of 8q. Here, BCOR was not associated with any of these parameters. In contrast, TP53 mutations were accompanied in all 4 cases by TP53 deletions, while only 3/24 TP53 wild-type cases harbored a TP53 deletion ( P =0.002). In addition, only one of 4 TP53 mutated cases harbored a chromosome 14 rearrangement while 18/25 (72%) TP53 wild-type cases did ( P =0.105). In line with this result, TP53 deletions were also negatively associated with chromosome 14 rearrangements (2/7 vs 17/22, P =0.030). Further, all cases with a gain of 8q harbored a 14q rearrangement (13/13 vs 8/18 without gain of 8q, P =0.001). Conclusions: 1. CBA, FISH and mutation analysis of TP53 and BCOR revealed genetic abnormalities in all 36 analyzed cases. 2. The most frequent abnormality involved the TCRA/D locus (14q11) (20/30; 66.7%) activating the proto-oncogenes TCL1A on chromosome 14q32 (90.0%) or MTCP1 on chromosome Xq28 (10.0%). 3. Deletions were detected for ATM (63.3%), TP53 (24.1%), 6q (40.0%), 13q (34.6%), 12p (28.0%), and a gain was detected for the long arm of chromosome 8 (43.3%). 3. In addition to the detection of TP53 mutations in 11.4%, BCOR mutations were observed for the first time in a lymphatic malignancy with a mutation frequency of 14.3%. 4. The prognostic relevance of such cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations has to be determined in T-PLL, given that in myeloid malignancies both BCOR and TP53 are associated with shorter OS.
