    "abstract_text": "Abstract 794 Background: The cytoplasmic, non-receptor JAK2 tyrosine kinase is mutated at amino acid residue 617 (from valine to phenylalanine) in most patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), resulting in a constitutively activated kinase that phosphorylates STAT proteins in the absence of upstream signals. Overexpression of JAK2V617F leads to cytokine-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells and the JAK2V617F transgenic and knockin mice develop a disease phenotype resembling human polycythemia vera. Results: We hypothesized that the JAK2V617F occurs so consistently in MPNs because it gains some functional property. The type II arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 was initially identified because of its interaction with JAK2 in a yeast two hybrid screen. We examined the interaction between JAK2 and PRMT5 and found that JAK2V617F and JAK2K539L (another active JAK2 kinase) bound PRMT5 more strongly than did wild-type JAK2. PRMT5 mediates the symmetrical dimethylation of arginine residues within histones H2A and H4 and methylates other cellular proteins as well, such as p53. The oncogenic forms of JAK2 acquire the ability to phosphorylate PRMT5, which greatly impaired its methyltransferase activity. We have shown the in vivo importance of this post-translation modification as treating JAK2V617F-positive cells (but not the wild-type JAK2-harboring cells) with different JAK2 inhibitors significantly increased histone arginine methylation levels. To define the effect of inhibiting PRMT5 activity on hematopoiesis, we knocked down PRMT5 in human cord blood derived CD34+ cells using shRNA and observed increased colony formation and erythroid differentiation; In contrast, PRMT5 overexpression in these cells led to reduced colony formation and inhibition of erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, overexpression of PRMT5, especially a phosphorylation site mutant form of PRMT5 (PRMT5M6), diminishes the proliferative and erythroid generating capacity of JAK2V617F+ CD34+ cells isolated from MPN patients to a greater degree than normal cord blood CD34+ cells. Importantly, we found marked increase in PRMT5 phosphorylation in JAK2V617F-positive MPN patents relative to normal cord blood CD34+ cells, suggesting that this phosphorylation is important for the myeloproliferation phenotype. Conclusion: we show that the oncogenic mutant forms of JAK2 kinase, such as JAK2V617F and JAK2K539L, are not simply constitutively active forms of wild-type JAK2, rather they have specific gains-of-function that allow them to phosphorylate PRMT5 and down-regulate its enzymatic activity. Inhibition of PRMT5 contributes to the myeloproliferation and erythroid differentiation promoting effects of JAK2V617F. This gain-of \u2013function mutation results in cross-talk between oncogenic kinases and histone arginine methylation. Taken together, we demonstrate a novel link between the mutant JAK2 kinases and PRMT5 methyltransferase activity, which contributes to MPN pathogenesis. Further insights about the shared gene expression profile of JAK2 inhibition vs. PRMT5 knockdown will be presented to understand the basics for the behavior change in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells brought about by these two interventions.
