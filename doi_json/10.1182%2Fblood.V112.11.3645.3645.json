    "abstract_text": "MicroRNA\u2019s (miR) are small noncoding RNA\u2019s of 18\u201325 nucleotides that have a critical impact on gene regulation affecting cell growth & differentiation. Importantly, miR expression profiles can help distinguish normal cells from cancerous cells. This is particularly relevant to myelodysplastic syndromes both because of their heterogeneity as well as the difficulties associated with the early diagnosis of these disorders. We investigated the miR profiles of CD34+ and total nucleated cells (TNC) from different subtypes of MDS (n=135) and compared these to AML (n=20), normal CD34+ (n=5) and normal TNC\u2019s (n=6). We used the Illumina universal array matrix to interrogate 470 validated miR\u2019s from the Sanger mir-Base database and a further 265 putative miR\u2019s from the literature. Array intensity data was analysed using the Partek Genomics Suite v6.3. Data was normalised using quantile normalisation and unchanging miR\u2019s removed. A 1-way ANOVA was used to identify differentially expressed miR\u2019s and a FDR correction applied to control for Type I errors. Our initial analysis compared TNC (n=6) with CD34 cells (n=5) from normal controls. As expected both groups clustered separately with mir-199a (p<10 \u22129 ), mir-30a-3p (p<10 \u22127 ), mir-507 (p<10 \u22127 ) showing the most significant differences out of a total of 250 differentially expressed miR\u2019s. Our results clearly identified an expression signature for low risk (LR), high risk (HR) and AML using data from both TNC\u2019s and CD34+ cells compared to normal TNC and CD34+ cells. Cluster analysis of miR\u2019s of CD34+ cells from normal controls (n=5) and monosomy 7 (\u22127) patients (n=6) identified a panel of 18 miR\u2019s that differentiated both groups. Similarly, analysis of CD34+ cells from HR MDS (n=7) and normal CD34+ controls identified a unique panel of 34 miR\u2019s differentiating both groups. Analysis of CD34+ cells from both del(5q) (n=4) and LR MDS cases (n=8) identified a panel of 154 and 23 miR\u2019s respectively that differentiated these from the normal controls. A 4-way intersect analysis of miR expression from CD34+ cells from LR, HR, del(5q) and \u22127 groups did not identify any common miR\u2019s when compared to normal CD34+ cells. However, a 3-way analysis using LR, HR and \u22127 groups identified mir-34a as a single common miR. The mir-34 family (a, b, c) are transcriptional targets for p53 and have been shown to be induced by DNA damage and oncogenic stress (He et al , 2007). A direct comparison of miR expression in CD34+ cells from LR and HR showed only 4 miR\u2019s that are differentially expressed with significant fold changes; mir-656 (53x), mir-498 (32x), mir-181b (\u221217x) and mir-130a (\u22124x). Such differences where not observed in TNC from LR and HR samples. A 4-way intersect analysis on TNC\u2019s from LR (n=47), del(5q) (n=5), HR (n=50) and \u22127 (n=8) cases identified 8 common miR\u2019s; mir-34b, mir-139, mir-429, mir-519a, mir-548b, mir-561, mir-580 and mir-619. Comparison of the miR expression in TNC from AML samples against normal TNC identified 49 differentially expressed miR\u2019s including let-7e, mir-181a, mir- 181b, mir-199a and mir-221 in accordance with previous published miR profiles in AML (Dixon-McIver et al , 2008). We also observed a 17 fold down regulation of mir-127 which is often silenced in cancer cells due to the methylation and acetylation status of the mir-127 promoter. The proto-oncogene BCL6 is a verified target of mir-127 (Saito et al , 2006). To our knowledge this is the first study in MDS that shows unique miR profiles in TNC for each subgroup when compared to normal TNC. Furthermore, miR profiles from CD34+ cells distinguish between the different MDS subtypes. In conclusion our analysis has shown that profiling miR\u2019s in MDS results in unique profiles which may be used to discriminate between HR and LR MDS subgroups.",
