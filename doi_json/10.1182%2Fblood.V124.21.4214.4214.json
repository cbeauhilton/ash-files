    "abstract_text": "Warfarin targets vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) to interfere with blood coagulation in humans. Warfarin is the most widely used oral anticoagulant, but its inhibition mechanism remains largely unknown. Here we use quantitative mass spectrometry to show that warfarin changes the intracellular redox state of human VKOR. Warfarin induces this redox shift at a physiological dosage that correlates well with warfarin-inhibited VKOR activity. The warfarin-induced redox change is prevented by the mutation of two critical cysteines, suggesting that they form a disulfide bond essential for warfarin binding. We also mapped warfarin binding through its interaction with warfarin resistant mutations located at different structural regions of human VKOR. Modeling of these interactions suggests how warfarin binds to a VKOR conformation that is stabilized by the essential disulfide bond. Thus, after sixty years of clinical use of warfarin, we now have a good mechanistic understanding that this drug blocks human VKOR at a specific conformational and redox state.
