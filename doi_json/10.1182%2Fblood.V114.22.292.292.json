    "abstract_text": "Abstract 292 Background: Allelic deficiency for the RPS14 gene impairs differentiation and survival of erythroid progenitors in del(5q) MDS ( Nature 2008; 451:335). Nucleolar stress arising from disruption of ribosome assembly fosters MDM2 sequestration by free ribosome components resulting in p53 stabilization and erythroid hypoplasia ( Nat Cell Biol 2009; 11:501). We recently reported that reduced gene dosage of the lenalidomide (LEN) inhibitable, haplodeficient phosphatases CDC25C and PP2Ac\u03b1 is a key determinant of drug sensitivity in del(5q) MDS ( PNAS 2009; 106: 12974). We now show that shRNA suppression of these genes to levels commensurate with haplodeficiency reinforces p53 accumulation, and that treatment with LEN promotes MDM2-mediated p53 degradation to transition del(5q) clones to G 2 /M arrest. We hypothesized that emergence of resistance to LEN in del(5q) MDS arises from two possible mechanisms: (1) up-regulation of haplodeficient drug targets or compensatory isotypes, or (2) inactivating mutations of the TP53 or CDC25C genes. Methods: To investigate mechanisms of LEN resistance, we studied sequential bone marrow (BM) specimens obtained at baseline (BL), response to treatment (TR) and treatment failure (TF) from 12 LEN treated patients with Low/INT-1 risk, transfusion-dependent del(5q) MDS. Eleven patients achieved clonal suppression and transfusion independence; 7 patients developed clinical drug resistance with primary clonal recovery. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for cdc25-C, -A and -B; PP2A\u2013Ca and p53 were performed using a biotin-streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase method and compared to 6 age-matched controls; intensity of cytoplasmic or nuclear staining in hematopoietic elements was recorded after blinded review. DNA and RNA were extracted from cryopreserved BM mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) or fixed paraffin blocks from BM clot and biopsy sections. Expression of CDC25C splice variants was assessed by RT-PCR and total gene expression by real time (QT)-PCR. Exonic DNA encoding the catalytic [exons 8\u201314] and nuclear export domains [exon 11] of CDC25C and the DNA-binding domain of TP53 [exons 4\u20139] was sequenced for gene mutation analysis. Differences in mean values were compared by paired t-test. Results: P53 immunostaining was significantly higher in del(5q) BL specimens compared to controls ( relative expression [RE] 9.6 vs. 0.25; P =0.007). An admixture of nuclear and cytoplasmic staining for p53 and each cdc25 isotype was observed at BL that was largely restricted to erythroid precursors, whereas at TR cdc25-C and -A expression was primarily cytoplasmic, consistent with drug-induced nuclear exclusion. At TR, RE of only cdc25C (BL, 75 vs. TR, 49; P =0.05) and PP2A (29.2 vs. 12.3; P =0.025) was significantly reduced; whereas at TF cdc25C (TR, 43 vs. TF, 166; P =0.003), cdc25A (42.4 vs. 150; P =0.006), PP2A (7.3 vs. 65.6; P =0.028) and p53 (0.92 vs. 25.4; P =0.024) RE significantly increased. Nuclear localization of cdc25C and p53 but not cdc25A predominated at TF, consistent with escape from cdc25C inhibition. QT-PCR confirmed transcriptional up-regulation of CDC25C at TF with a mean 8.8-fold increase in gene expression vs. BL. DNA sequencing revealed no acquisition of somatic mutations within the CDC25C and TP53 exons studied [n=5]. Conclusions: Secondary resistance to LEN in del(5q) MDS is associated with over-expression and activation of the haplodeficient drug-inhibitable phosphatases, cdc25C and PP2A, with consequent restoration of wt-p53 activation. Absence of gene mutations within the coding exons analyzed suggests that transcriptional compensation alone is responsible for drug resistance. Novel agents targeting transcriptional repression of CDC25C may restore LEN sensitivity and merit investigation in drug resistant del(5q) MDS.
