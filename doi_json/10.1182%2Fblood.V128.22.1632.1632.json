    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: L-Asparaginase (L-Asp) derived from E. coli is one of the essential drugs for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoma. Native L-Asp often causes hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, which account for termination and inferior outcome of L-Asp therapy of ALL. Since the characteristics of L-Asp-induced hypersensitivity are not well documented, there is neither suitable treatment for hypersensitivity to L-Asp nor animal model of L-Asp allergy. In addition, some anti-cancer drugs, used concomitantly with L-Asp, affect lymphocyte activities, the role of such drugs on L-Asp hypersensitivity is not known. Aims: In this study, we induced type I hypersensitivity to E. coli L-Asp in mice in order to investigate the mechanism and treatment of L-Asp allergy. Anti-IgE antibody, binding to Fc region of IgE to block the binding to Fc\u03b5RI receptor, was used as a candidate for the treatment of L-Asp hypersensitivity. Furthermore, we examined the effects of methotrexate (MTX) and cyclophosphamide (CY). which reportedly impair the functions of Th17 and Treg cells, respectively. Methods: Male BALB/c mice (7 week old) were intraperitoneally injected L-Asp (10, 20, 100 IU/mouse) with Al (OH) 3 gel on days 0 and 14. The right ears of the mice were locally sensitized on days 17, 20, 23 by intradermal injection of L-Asp (1, 2, 10 IU/mouse). Antigen challenge was carried out on day 26 by intradermal injection of L-Asp. MTX (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) and CY (150 mg/kg) were intraperitoneally administrated on day -2 and day 12. On day 25, either anti-IgE antibody (50, 100 mg/mouse) or control IgG was intraperitoneally administered to the sensitized mice. The ear thickness was measured (n=6 or more). H&E and toluidine blue stainings of ear sections were performed. Results : L-Asp challenge immediately induced ear edema, in a dose-dependent manner. The reaction reached to a peak at 1 hr after stimulation (dosage: sensitization = 100 IU/mouse, challenge = 10 IU/mouse; edema thickness: 31.25\u00b13.8 \u03bcm vs control 4.38\u00b11.9 \u03bcm, p <0.01), which subsided within 24 hr. Microscopic observations showed eosonophil infiltration (H&E staining; 0.5\u00b10.2 cells/HPF in control ears and 10.4\u00b11.0 cells/HPF in challenged ears, P <0.001) and degranulation of mast cells (toluidine blue staining; 8.4\u00b10.9 % in control ears and 47.6\u00b15.8 % in challenged ear, P <0.001). Anti-IgE antibody significantly inhibited the ear swelling to 7.3\u00b11.2 \u03bcm ( P <0.01) as well as microscopic changes in eosinophil infiltration and mast cell degranulation. When the mice were treated with anticancer drugs prior to sensitization, the ear swellings were augmented by CY (43.54\u00b14.0 \u03bcm, P <0.05) but not MTX (31.67\u00b15.5 \u03bcm, not significant). Anti-IgE antibody also inhibited CY-augmented ear swelling. Conclusions : From these results, we firstly established animal model for type I hypersensitivity to L-Asp. Using this model, we conclude that non-anaphylactogenic neutralizing antibody of IgE, such as omalizumab, can be a candidate drug for the treatment of L-Asp hypersensitivity. Also, CY-induced suppression of Treg function may enhance Th2 responses so as to augment L-Asp hypersensitivity. Further investigations for the detection and avoidance of L-Asp hypersensitivity are under the way. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
