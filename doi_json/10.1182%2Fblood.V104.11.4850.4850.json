    "abstract_text": "Background : MM is a plasma cell neoplasm of unknown etiology. Recent studies have shown that cytokines play an important stimulatory or inhibitory role in myeloma cell growth. IL-6 is an essential growth factor for MM and increased IL-6 serum levels have been correlated with poor prognosis. TNF\u03b1 and LT\u03b1 are two critical cytokines produced early in the inflammatory reaction process and potent inducers of IL-6 that may, indirectly, stimulate plasma-cell growth. Considering that the serum level of cytokines also depends on genetic control, polymorphisms in promoter regions of these genes may play a role in MM pathogenesis. Aims : 1) to determine the prevalence of IL-6, TNF\u03b1 and LT\u03b1 genotypes in MM patients and controls; 2) to verify the impact of these genoypes on patients\u2019 survival. Methods : Sixty healthy individuals (matched by age, sex, and race) and fifty-two MM patients, enrolled from a sole institution from November 2002 to November 2003 were studied. Relevant clinical and laboratory characteristics documented at diagnosis were evaluated. Molecular analyses were made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by specific endonuclease restriction disgestion to determine the following polymorphisms: IL-6 (\u2212174 G/C), TNF\u03b1 (\u2212308 G/A, named T1 and T2 respectively) and LT\u03b1 (+252 G/A, named 10.5 and 5.5 respectively). Event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves. Results : IL-6, TNF\u03b1 and LT\u03b1 genotypes are presented in the table. We found no difference in the prevalence of IL-6, TNF\u03b1 and LT\u03b1 genotypes when MM patients were compared to control group. Similarly, when TNF\u03b1 and LT\u03b1 were analyzed as haplotype, no difference was observed in both groups. Median EFS and OS was analyzed for each cytokine. The median EFS for the GG genotype of IL-6 was 17 months compared to 13 months for the CG or CC genotypes (p=0.09). The median EFS for the presence of at least one T2 allele of TNF\u03b1 was 26 months compared to 13 months for the homozygous T1 genotype (p=0.06). The median OS for the 10.5/10.5 genotype of the LT\u03b1 was 112 months compared to 42 months for the 5.5/10.5 or 5.5/5.5 genotypes (p=0.04). We observed tendency to prolonged EFS on the GG genotype of IL-6, and with the presence of at least one T2 allele of TNF\u03b1. A longer OS was seen on 10.5/10.5 genotype of the LT\u03b1. We concluded that the 10.5/10.5 genotype, related to normal production of LT\u03b1, may have influence on OS in our group of patients. We believe that multicenter studies and longer follow up could help us to confirm these results.
