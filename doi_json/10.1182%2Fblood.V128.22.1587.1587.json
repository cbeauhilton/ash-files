    "abstract_text": "Cancer cells experience higher intrinsic oxidative stress than their normal counterparts and acquire adaptive antioxidant mechanisms to maintain redox balance. This increased antioxidant capacity has been correlated to malignant transformation, metastasis and resistance to standard anticancer drugs. This enhanced antioxidant state also correlates with cancer cells being more vulnerable to additional oxidative insults, therefore disruption of adaptive antioxidant mechanisms may have significant therapeutic implications. Hematological malignancies including Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Multiple Myeloma (MM) are critically dependent on the cellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH), consistent with the higher intrinsic oxidative stress. L-cysteine is the rate-limiting substrate for GSH biosynthesis and adequate levels of cysteine are critical to maintain the intracellular homeostasis of GSH. CLL and a subset of ALL cells have been reported to rely on the stromal supply of cysteine to increase the synthesis of GSH in order to maintain redox balance, which in turn promotes cell survival and fosters drug resistance. One approach to target this cancer specific dependency is by therapeutic depletion of amino acids via enzyme administration; a clinically validated strategy for the treatment of ALL. Aeglea BioTherapeutics Inc. has developed a bioengineered cysteine and cystine degrading enzyme (Cyst(e)inase, AEB3103) and evaluated its therapeutic efficacy against hematological malignancies in in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo pre-clinical studies. The TCL1-TG:p53 -/- mouse model exhibits a drug resistant phenotype resembling human CLL with unfavorable cytogenetic alterations and highly aggressive disease progression. AEB3103 greatly decreased the viability of TCL1-TG:p53 -/- cells cultured in vitro , whereas the CLL therapeutic, fludarabine, showed minimal cytotoxic effects. In vivo treatment of TCL1-TG:p53 -/- mice with AEB3103 resulted in an increase in median survival time (7 months, p<0.0001) compared to the untreated control group (3.5 months, p<0.001) and a fludarabine treated group (5.3 months, p<0.001). These results indicate a superior therapeutic effect of AEB3103 compared to fludarabine. Additionally, evaluation of AEB3103 in in vitro 2D cultures of patient-derived CLL and MM cells, and in ex vivo 3D cultures of cells derived from ALL and AML PDx models resulted in significant cell growth inhibition with therapeutically relevant IC 50 values. Collectively these results demonstrate the sensitivity of hematological malignancies to modulation of GSH levels via AEB3103-mediated cyst(e)ine depletion.
