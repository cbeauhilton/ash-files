    "abstract_text": "Introduction R-CHOP is the standard of care for patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) however poor risk patients (IPI 3-5) still have an inadequate outcome. Neither first remission high dose chemotherapy and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (HDC+PBSCT) nor selection of cases for intensification by interim PET scanning have demonstrated a proven benefit. In the case of Burkitts lymphoma (BL) there is a paucity of data on the addition of Rituximab to the CODOX-M and IVAC regimen. Patients and Methods 113 patients with DLBCL and 37 with BL were recruited from 53 UK sites between May 2008 and April 2013. Median age was 49 years (18-65). For DLBCL patients IPI scores were 3 \u2013 72 ( 64%), 4 -40 (35%) and 5 \u2013 1 (1%). All patients received the modified CODOX-M and IVAC regimen including all CNS directed therapy( Mead et al Ann Oncol. 2002 Aug;13(8):1264-74) and 8 doses of rituximab. The primary end point of the study was Progression Free survival (PFS) and secondary endpoints included toxicity and CR rate. Results The main toxicities reported were neutropenia ( 89% grade 3 or 4), thrombocytopenia (84.2% grade 3 or 4), infection 61.6% grade 3 or 4 and mucositis (30.1% grade 3 or 4). 4 patients were excluded from toxicity assessment as they did not start therapy after registration. There were 8 treatment related deaths observed (infection with neutropenia (5), GI haemorrhage (1), acute cerebral haemorrhage (1) and bowel perforation (1) ). 78 patients with DLBCL and 31 with BL have completed all therapy ( 78.5 % of patients with available data) with an overall response rate of 92 % for DLBCl and 94% for BL. In patients who completed all therapy CR was achieved in 34 (44%), CR (u) in 8 (10%) and PR in 30 (38%) for DLBCL patients and CR was achieved in 21 (68%), CR (u) in 6 (19%) and PR in 2 (6%) in BL patients. 3 patients ( 2 DLBCL and 1 BL) who progressed during therapy have been included in the response analysis. End of treatment PET scanning was not obligatory. 80 patients with DLBCL and 30 patients with BL remain alive and without progression at a median follow up of 18.6 and 19.3 months respectively. Conclusion The R-CODOX-M -R-IVAC regimen can be delivered to patients with poor risk DLBCL in a multicentre setting. High rates of haematological toxicity and consequent infection are inevitable with treatment of this intensity but appear acceptable when compared with other treatments such as HDC+PBSCT. Response rates are encouraging in view of the very poor risk IPI profile of the patients included in this study. Burkitts lymphoma patients also achieved an excellent response rate with no apparent additional toxicity attributable to the addition of rituximab to the regimen. We currently plan the first analysis for the primary endpoint of PFS in 2015. The Trial was supported by Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research (LLR).
