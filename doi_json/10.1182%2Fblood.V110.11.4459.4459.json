    "abstract_text": "Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who develop lymphomatous meningitis (LM) during or after first-line treatment have a poor prognosis, with CNS relapse occurring within 1 year in approximately 80%. Risk factors have been defined and prophylaxis is recommended in patients with high-risk DLBCL. Liposomal cytarabine (DepoCyte\u00ae), a sustained-release preparation of cytarabine for intrathecal (IT) injection, has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in the treatment of LM. Its long CSF half-life allows liposomal cytarabine to be given less frequently than conventional therapy, reducing discomfort for patients and the risks associated with repeated lumbar punctures. The potential of liposomal cytarabine to improve the outcome of prophylaxis against LM is being investigated into a multicenter and prospective trial in patients with high-risk DLBCL in Spain. Preliminary safety results are reported in 22 patients (median age 67 years; range 18\u201379; 14 male) with newly diagnosed DLBCL at high risk of developing LM (defined as the presence of at least one of the following criteria: retroperitoneal mass >10 cm, Waldeyer\u2019s ring or paranasal involvement, involvement of >30% bone marrow, testicular involvement) who received prophylactic IT liposomal cytarabine during treatment with R-CHOP14 regimen between June 2006 and July 2007 at 10 centers in Spain. Liposomal cytarabine 50 mg was administered during the first day of treatment at first, second and sixth cycles of R-CHOP14 scheme (study days 1, 15 and 71). The median number of doses administered was 3 (range 1\u20133). Seventeen patients received corticosteroid as prophylaxis for chemical arachnoiditis: 16 dexamethasone (4 mg IT [n = 9] or PO at varying dosages [n = 7]); and 1 patient received IT hydrocortisone (20 mg). The remaining patients did not receive specific corticosteroid prophylaxis for chemical arachnoiditis. Overall, liposomal cytarabine was well tolerated. Six patients experienced minor side effects including headache (Grade 1/2, n = 4; grade 3/4, n = 2) and nausea/vomiting (Grade 3/4, n = 1). No signs of neurological progression or relapsed were observed. These preliminary observations indicate that IT injection of liposomal cytarabine (DepoCyte\u00ae) is well tolerated and can be administered safely in combination with dose-dense regimens. Longer-term follow-up will be needed to confirm these encouraging observations."
