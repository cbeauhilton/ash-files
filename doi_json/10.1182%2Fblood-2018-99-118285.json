    "abstract_text": "Introduction. The use of cryopreservation of hematopoietic precursors for autologous or allogeneic transplantation with DMSO is a procedure commonly used in many countries, but it is expensive and is not exempt of risks, since serious adverse events have been described. Our group recently published a comparative study between two centers and showed that avoiding DMSO cryopreservation favors better transplantation tolerance, significantly shorter hospitalizations, fewer episodes of febrile neutropenia and mucositis. In this report we show the financial analysis of both modalities of CRYO and Non CRYO preserved transplants. Methodology Database of the adult hematopoietic transplant program of our institution was retrospectively analyzed. Since Non CRYO modality was initiated in our institution on 2015, we compared 3 years before and after that date, assigning two groups (CRYO and Non CRYO). Costs data of mobilization, apheresis, hospitalization, freezing and blood banking were analyzed. Results Between 2013 and 2018, 90 autologous hematopoietic transplants were performed, 41 CRYO and 49 Non CRYO. The average cost of mobilization therapy with filgrastim and the use of plerixafor did not differ between groups (p = 0.26). The number of apheresis needed to achieve a satisfactory count was higher in CRYO (median 1.5 vs 1.2 p = 0.001) with 55% higher cost on average. The cost of transplant hospitalization including antibiotics costs, blood banking costs, analgesics requirements and nutritional parenteral support was lower in Non CRYO (minimum cost USD 8000, maximum USD 160000 average value USD 20.000) than in CRYO (minimum cost USD 11.000, maximum USD 200.000, average value USD 32000) (p = 0.001). Conclusions In addition to promoting better patient tolerance, Non CRYO modality in our country has lower cost. This information has important relevance for health systems of developing countries and can promote better access to transplant. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
