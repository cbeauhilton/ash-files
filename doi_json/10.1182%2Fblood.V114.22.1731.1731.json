    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1731 Poster Board I-757 Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway has been described to be critical in the survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Here, we have analyzed the effect of two selective chemical inhibitors of Akt (Akti-1/2 and A-443654) in the survival of CLL cells. We studied by cytometric analysis the cytotoxic effects of Akt inhibitors on peripheral B and T lymphocytes from patients with CLL and from healthy donors. Both inhibitors induced apoptosis in CLL cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, B cells from CLL samples were more sensitive to Akt inhibitors than T cells from CLL samples, and B or T cells from healthy donors. Survival factors for CLL cells, such as IL-4 and SDF-1a, were not able to block the apoptosis induced by both Akt inhibitors. We studied the changes induced by Akti-1/2 and A-443654 at mRNA level by performing reverse transcriptase multiplex ligation\u2013dependent probe amplification (RT-MLPA). Akti-1/2 did not induce any change in the mRNA expression profile of genes involved in apoptosis, while A-443654 induced some changes, including an increase in NOXA and PUMA mRNA levels, suggesting the existence of additional targets for A-443654. We also studied the changes induced by both Akt inhibitors in some BCL-2 protein family members on CLL cells by Western blot. Both inhibitors induced an increase in PUMA and NOXA protein levels, and a decrease in MCL-1 protein level. Moreover, Akti-1/2 and A-443654 induced apoptosis irrespective of TP53 status. These results demonstrate that Akt inhibitors induce apoptosis of CLL cells and might be a new therapeutic option for the treatment of CLL. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
