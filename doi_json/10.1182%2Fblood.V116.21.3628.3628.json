    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3628 Background. Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by bone marrow (BM) infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells and monoclonal IgM gammopathy. The deletion 6q is the most frequent cytogenetic aberration in WM and it has been suspected that this region harbours a tumour suppressor gene of pathogenic significance for WM. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array delineated several minimal deleted regions (MDR) on 6q and pointed out key regulator genes of the NFKB pathway involved in these deletions, including A20 gene. The zinc finger protein A20 has been characterized as dual inhibitor of NFKB activation and was recently described as a tumor suppressor gene in lymphoma. However, the mechanisms of A20 deregulation are not fully understood in WM. We aimed to study the mechanisms of A20 deregulation in WM using gene expression profiling (GEP) and single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) based array s, a powerful high resolution method allowing both the detection of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number alteration (CNA) analysis in the same experiment. Methods. We have studied BM samples from 42 patients (pts) with WM (31 males, mean age: 67 years). Conventional karyotype study was analyzed following stimulation with IL2 and DSP30 of BM cells. FISH analysis was performed to detect deletion 6q21 (MYB probe). DNA and RNA were extracted following BM CD19 B cell negative selection. Quantification of copy number of A20 gene was performed using real time PCR, RNAse P gene was used as reference gene. Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (Affymetrix chips) was used to detect both LOH and CNA in 31 pts. Paired samples (B cells/normal T lymphocytes) were used as an intra-individual reference to distinguish germline polymorphisms from somatic abnormalities in 29 patients. Size, position and location of genes were referenced using UCSC HG18 assembly, LOH and CNA were identified using genotyping console 3.02 software (Affymetrix) and Partek genomic suite. Gene expression profiling (GEP) was performed in 11 pts using Affymetrix U133A arrays. Gene-expression intensity values were log transformed, normalized and analyzed using GeneSpring GX software. Results. SNP array identified deletion 6q in 9/31 (29%) patients, confirmed by FISH analysis. All cases were monoallelic deletion. In 90% of cases, deletion 6q was associated with others genetic abnormalities. In one case, we observed a loss of 6q combined with a gain of 6p. Deletion 6q was associated with gain of chromosome 4 in 2 cases, and with deletion of 13q in 3 cases. The MDR was located on chromosome 6q21-6q25. This MDR contained several candidate genes included always deletion of A20 gene, located on 6q23, and was confirmed by real time DNA PCR quantification in all cases. Overall, the frequency of A20 gene deletion in our entire WM cohort (N=42 pts) was 29.2% (12/42), determined by real time DNA PCR of the copy number of A20 gene. In patient without deletion 6q, we looked at potential deregulated mechanisms of A20 by LOH with no CNA, e.g. UPD (uniparental disomy). We have not seen any UPD targeting the A20 gene. We then looked at A20 gene expression by GEP, and found no significant variation of A20 gene expression related to A20 monoallelic deletion as compared to pts with two copies, reflecting probably the existence of other mechanisms of A20 gene deregulation. This result was consistent with the absence of clear difference in genome-wide expression profiling in pts with 6q deletion and those without the deletion. As A20 is a key player in the negative feedback loop regulation of NFKB, we also looked at the gene expression of a set of genes involved in NFKB pathway. The presence or absence of A20 deletion did not influence the gene expression profiling of this NFKB pathway gene set. Conclusion. We described a high frequency of deletion of A20 gene. In most cases, deletion of A20 was associated with other genetic abnormalities. A20 deletion was not associated with a significant signature by GEP. Additional studies are needed to understand the cellular consequences of A20 deletions in the pathogenesis of WM.
