Several studies have shown the applicability and prognostic value of an NPM1 mutation ( NPM1 mut )-based assay for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD). So far, there are no studies evaluating the prognostic value of NPM1 mut MRD levels in a large controlled cohort of AML patients (pts) enrolled on prospective clinical trials. Aims To evaluate the prognostic value of NPM1 mut MRD levels in younger (16 to 60 years) AML pts harbouring NPM1 mutations type A, B or D, and to assess the influence of concurrent FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITD). Methods All pts were enrolled in the prospective AMLSG 07-04 and AML HD98A treatment trials. Treatment comprised double induction therapy with ICE (idarubicin, cytarabine, etoposide) followed by high-dose cytarabine-based consolidation, autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Levels of NPM1 mut expression ratios, defined as NPM1 mut copies per 10 4 ABL copies, were determined by RQ-PCR using TaqMan technology. Dilution series showed a maximum sensitivity of 10 -6 and high specificity as no wildtype NPM1 could be detected. Results A total of 1079 samples, [bone marrow (BM), n=1062; peripheral blood, n= 17) from 212 pts were analyzed at diagnosis, after each treatment cycle, during follow-up and at relapse (median number of samples per pt, n=4; range, 1-16). NPM1 mut expression ratios at diagnosis varied between 1.1\u00d710 4 and 10.4\u00d710 6 (median, 6.9\u00d710 5 ). Pretreatment transcript levels were not associated with clinical characteristics (e.g., age, white cell counts, BM blasts) and did not impact on relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Following the first induction cycle, the median decrease of the MRD level ratio normalized to pretreatment levels was 4.21\u00d710 -3 , independent of the presence of concurrent FLT3 -ITD (p=0.39) . After the 2nd induction cycle, the median reduction of MRD levels was significantly stronger in the FLT3 -ITD neg group (6.75\u00d710 -5 ) compared with the FLT3 -ITD pos group (4.19\u00d710 -4 ) (p=0.003) and this differential effect was observed throughout consolidation therapy. For evaluation of the prognostic impact of NPM1 mut MRD levels, we compared patients achieving PCR-negativity with those with positive values at different checkpoints. The first reliable checkpoint was after double-induction therapy: the cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) at 4 years of PCR-negative patients (n=27) was 0% compared with 48% (SE, 4.4%, p<0.00001) for PCR-positive patients (n=105). This translated into a significant better OS (p=0.0005). The second checkpoint was after completion of consolidation therapy (first measurement during follow-up period). Again, 4-year CIR was significantly (p<.00001) lower in the PCR-negative group with 11% (SE, 6.5%) compared with 51% (SE, 4.8%) in PCR-positive patients, again translating in a significantly better OS (p<.00001). In addition, the level of NPM1 mut expression ratio at any time point examined after completion of therapy correlated with the risk of relapse, since 20 of 22 pts with a value above 1000 NPM1 mut /10 4 ABL copies relapsed after a median interval of 90 days (range, 11-709 days). The remaining 2 pts had increasing levels at last follow-up but are still in continuous complete remission (CR). In a few cases relapse prediction appeared to be limited due to inadequate increase of NPM1 mut expression levels or to loss of NPM1 mutation at the time of relapse (n=5). On the other hand, we observed a number of pts (n=17) in continuous CR who had intermittent low (<1000 NPM1 mut /10 4 ABL copies) NPM1 mut expression ratios. Conclusions The levels of NPM1 mut expression at two distinct checkpoints, after double induction therapy and after completion of consolidation therapy, can be used as a prognostic factor in NPM1 mut AML pts. The adverse outcome of pts carrying a concurrent FLT3 -ITD is reflected by a significant lower reduction of tumor burden. Disclosures Go\u0308hring: Celgene Corp.: .
