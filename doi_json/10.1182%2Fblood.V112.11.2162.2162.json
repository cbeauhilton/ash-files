    "abstract_text": "Median ages of pts with most hematological malignancies are beyond 60 years. The advent of nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens has extended the use of allogeneic HCT to these older pts. Here, we retrospectively investigated outcomes among 280 pts aged \u226560 years, given HCT between 1998 and 2006. Results were broken down in 3 age groups 60\u201364 (n=166), 65\u201369 (n=90), and \u226570 (n=24) years old, respectively. Pts aged \u226570 years had less preceding chemotherapy, less often failed autologous HCT, more often had related grafts, and had higher comorbidity scores compared to pts in the other two age groups (table 1). Acute leukemias were more frequent and lymphoma/multiple myeloma were less frequent among pts aged \u226570 years old, resulting in higher risk for relapse (Table 1). After HCT, non-relapse mortality, relapse, and progression free survivals at 5-years for all pts were 26%, 41%, and 32% respectively. Five-year Kaplan Meier rate of overall survival was 35%, of those 12% vs. 23% were with vs. without chronic GVHD requiring immunosuppressive therapy, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in outcomes among the three age groups except for more infections and days of hospitalization among pts aged 65\u201369 years compared to the other two age groups (Table 2). In multivariate analyses of risk factors, high HCT-comorbidity index (1\u20132 and \u22653) independently predicted higher NRM (HR: 2.84 and 3.0, respectively, p =0.01) and, not surprisingly, previously defined high relapse risk predicted relapse (HR: 2.17, p =0.06); both predicted worse OS ( p =0.005 and p =0.0009, respectively) and PFS ( p =0.01 and p =0.02, respectively). Pts given unrelated grafts did as well as recipients of related grafts. In conclusion, nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT can be curative among pts older than 60 years with resolution of chronic GVHD among a majority of pts. Comorbidities and relapse risk rather than age should be used for benefit-risk assessment. Continued enrollment of elderly pts in prospective studies including unrelated donors is warranted.
