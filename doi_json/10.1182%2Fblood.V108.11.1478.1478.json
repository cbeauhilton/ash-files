    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: As clinical assessment of pretest probability (PTP) is now considered the first step in the diagnostic evaluation of DVT it is important to know if the clinical features of DVT are the same in men and women. OBJECTIVES: We sought to answer the following questions: 1) Is the prevalence of DVT the same in men and women who are referred for diagnostic testing? 2) Are the clinical features of DVT the same in men and women? 3) Does the Wells\u2019 clinical prediction model for first DVT perform similarly in men and women? METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of individual patient data from three studies that evaluated diagnostic testing in outpatients with a suspected first episode of DVT. Associations were assessed using univariable and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: A total of 1838 patients were eligible for final analyses, of whom 1132 (62%) were women and 706 (38%) were men. DVT was objectively diagnosed in 208 patients (11%). QUESTION 1: The prevalence of DVT was higher in men (14%) than in women (9%) (p=0.001). In a multivariable analysis that included eleven other clinical variables male gender was independently associated with a higher prevalence of DVT (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1\u20132.1). QUESTION 2: Of the confirmed episodes of DVT, \u201cswelling of the entire leg\u201d was observed more often in women (41%) than in men (16%) (p3cm\u201d (OR 8.2 vs. 2.9; p 60 yrs\u201d (OR 1.8 vs. 0.9; p=0.02) and \u201cbedridden for greater than 3 days\u201d (OR 3.7 vs. 1.4; p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Among outpatients referred with a suspected first episode of DVT, the prevalence of DVT is higher in men than in women but DVT is more extensive in women. Entire leg swelling is a more common and important sign of DVT in women than in men and the Wells prediction rule behaves differently in men than in women.",
