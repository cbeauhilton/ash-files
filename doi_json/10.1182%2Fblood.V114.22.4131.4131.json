    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4131 Genetic variants in DNA repair genes may affect DNA repair capacity and modulate cancer susceptibility. We analyzed genetic polymorphisms of 11 DNA repair genes: XRCC4, BRCA1, WRN, RAD51, XRCC3, ERCC1, ERCC2, XPC, OGG1, XRCC1 and MGMT to evaluate the association and risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A large-scale population-based, case-control study of 1700 controls and 659 cases was conducted in Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Korea. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs), ERCC1 IVS5 +33 CC, WRN 787 GG and XRCC1 399 GA genotypes were associated with decreased risk for AML [odds ratio (OR) = 0.71; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.92, p =0.01 for IVS5 +33 CC, 0.67; 0.50\u20130.89, p =0.006 for 3149 GG and 0.81; 0.67\u20130.98, p =0.031 for 1316 GA]. We found no differences in the XRCC4 S307, BRCA1 P87L, RAD51 \u2013G135C, XRCC3 T241M, ERCC2 K751Q, XPC K939Q, OGG1 S326C and MGMT L84F genotypes. Our results suggest that these 3 SNPs in DNA repair genes may affect AML susceptibility by modulating activities to maintain the genome integrity of each individual.
