    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4565 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and sefety of recombinant human thrombopoietin(rhTPO) prior to engraftment in adults with hematological malignancie who received allogeneic haematopoietil stem cell transplantation(Allo-HSCT). METHODS: This sutdy was a randomized, controlled clinical trial,38 patients were hematological malignancie, inclulding acute and chrinic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoma.They received Allo-HSCT and were randomly divided into groups(group A 19 cases, group B 19 cases).The group A was no-rhTPO as control, the group B were received rhTPO 15000U/d from +1 day, and continued until the untransfused platelet count was >70\u00d710 9 /L for two consecutived days. Patients received platelete transfusion when they developed severe thrombocytopenia<20\u00d710 9 /L. Efficacy and sefety of rhTPO on the outcome of Allo-HSCT were evaluated. RESULTS: In both group A and B, platelet decrease after Allo-HSCT had no sognificant difference. The platelet engraftment duration of group A and B was 15.68\u00b11.36(range 11\u201331) days and 13.47\u00b10.72(range 9\u201321) days, respectively. The amount of platelet transfusion of group A and B was 4\u00b10.55(range 20\u2013130) units and 2.89\u00b10.36(range 0\u201350) units, respectively. The effects of rhTPO on neutrophil engraftment, hepatic function, renal function, alloergic reations and acute GVHD were not found. CONCLUSION: The platelet engraftment duration of group B was shorter than that of group A(t=27.2, p<0.001), the amount of need platelet transfusion was significently less than those in the group A.There was a statistically significant difference in platelet engraftment and platelet transfusion needed(t=2.523, p<0.05). Administration of rhTPO prior to platelet engraftment after Allo-HSCT seem to be efficacy and safe. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
