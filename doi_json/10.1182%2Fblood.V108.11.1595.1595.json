    "abstract_text": "The alpha globin gene cluster contains two highly homologous alpha globin genes, HBA1 and HBA2, that code for identical proteins. Mutations in the alpha globin gene cluster are predominantly large deletions causing the loss of either one copy of the alpha-globin gene (e.g. -\u03b1 3.7 and -\u03b1 4.2 deletions) or both copies (e.g. --THAI, --FIL or --MED). A few large deletions encompassing the regulatory HS-40 region have also been described in alpha-thalassaemia patients. Point mutations and small base pair insertions or deletions have also been detected in HBA1 and HBA2 genes. Seven common large deletions in the alpha globin gene cluster are detected by a gapped-PCR assay. These common mutations and some other types of rearrangements can be detected by Southern blot, a laborious and time consuming method. However, these methods may not accurately identify the total number of copies of alpha globin like genes. We designed a single-tube alpha globin gene dosage assay (\u03b1GDA) using semi-quantitative fluorescent PCR (SQF PCR) for detecting the total number of alpha globin genes. Primers that amplify specific fragments from HBA1 and HBA2 genes, a fragment between the alpha globin pseudogenes, and three fragments flanking and including the HS-40 regulatory region were included in a single PCR reaction together with primers that amplify fragments from 3 different normalization genes. Using the \u03b1GDA, we were able to detect in patient samples varying copy numbers of alpha globin genes and to identify the nature of DNA rearrangements between HBA1 and HBA2. We also identified novel alpha globin conversion events that were verified by DNA sequencing. We also designed a complimentary comprehensive DNA sequencing assay to detect point mutations and small base pair insertions or deletions in the HBA1 and HBA2 genes. Using this method, and in combination with cation exchange HPLC and agarose gel electrophoresis, novel mutations in alpha globins were identified and submitted to the globin gene server, including Hb Linwood (\u03b12 40 Lys>Gln), Hb Creve Coeur (\u03b12 24 Tyr>Asp), and Hb Westborough (\u03b1-3.7 130 Ala>Val). The simplicity of \u03b1GDA will allow the replacement of the laborious Southern blot analysis to detect large deletions in the alpha globin gene cluster and to provide accurate information of total a-globin gene dosage, while the DNA sequencing assay will allow the detection of known and novel variants."
