    "abstract_text": "Background : Specific reversal agents for oral anticoagulants may be necessary to manage life-threatening bleeding or prior to emergency surgical procedures. While many reversal agents are in development, idarucizumab is approved and now available commercially in many countries. Idarucizumab is a humanized antibody fragment that specifically binds to dabigatran with high affinity and has shown immediate, complete and sustained reversal of dabigatran-induced anticoagulation in healthy male Caucasian volunteers. The present study investigated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of idarucizumab (part 1) and explored the effective dose of idarucizumab to reverse the dabigatran-induced anticoagulant effect (part 2) in healthy male Japanese volunteers. Methods : This was a two-part, phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-center, rising dose study. In part 1, subjects (n = 32) were randomized to receive either placebo (n = 2/dose group) or single intravenous doses of idarucizumab, 1, 2, or 4 g as a 5-minute infusion or 8 g as a 1-hour infusion (n = 6/group). In part 2, subjects (n = 48) were treated orally for 3 days with dabigatran etexilate (DE, 220 mg bid). On day 4, subjects received a final DE dose, followed a 3-day wash out period. Subjects were again treated orally for 3 days with DE, 220 mg bid. On Day 11, subjects received a final DE dose followed 2 hours later by placebo (n = 3/group) or idarucizumab (1, 2, 4, or 5 g [2.5 g followed by 2.5 g given 15 minutes apart]) as a 5-minute intravenous infusion, n = 9/group). The number of subjects with adverse events (AEs), emergence of anti-idarucizumab antibodies (ADAs), pharmacokinetics and the impact of idarucizumab on coagulation parameters were assessed (diluted thrombin time, ecarin clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and thrombin time). In addition, potential procoagulant effects were monitored as D-dimer and prothrombin fragment F1.2. Results : Idarucizumab attained a maximum concentration in plasma around the end of each infusion followed by a biphasic decline in plasma concentrations with a rapid initial phase and a longer terminal phase.. Dabigatran treatment prolonged the clotting times of all coagulation parameters. Idarucizumab infusion resulted in immediate and complete reversal of dabigatran-induced anticoagulation, reducing coagulation parameters below the upper limit of normal. The duration was dose-dependent; at 4 and 5 g of idarucizumab, complete reversal was sustained up to 72 hours, at lower doses \u2264 2 g a partial return of the anticoagulation activity of dabigatran was observed 1-2 hours after idarucizumab administration. Concentration of unbound dabigatran decreased to below the limit of quantification immediately after administration of a single dose of idarucizumab. Idarucizumab was safe and well tolerated, and no AEs were reported. There was no elevation of either D-dimer or F1.2 levels post idarucizumab as compared to levels prior to infusion in any of the dose groups. Treatment-emergent ADAs occurred in 6 of 60 patients receiving idarucizumab. Conclusion : Idarucizumab infusion achieved immediate, complete and sustained reversal of dabigatran-associated anticoagulation in healthy male Japanese volunteers. Idarucizumab was safe and well tolerated with no procoagulant effects. Disclosures van Ryn: Boehringer Ingelheim: Employment.
