    "abstract_text": "Background: Antigens like CD20 antigen, are established targets for antibody therapy with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) like Rituximab. Mixed clinico-pathological responses to mAb have been reported either due to presence of antibodies, rapid clearance or low density of target receptor/antigens. This demands need for an assay to monitor serum mAb therapeutic levels to ensure appropriate dosage. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is still the most widely used technique to detect mAb level in human serum which is expensive and time consuming. Understanding properties and interactions of antigens is quintessential for developing better targeted agents and overcoming resistance. Flow cytometry is still the most widely used technique to detect CD20 level in human serum which is expensive, time consuming and does not reveal any details of interaction between the molecules. We have developed a new innovative biosensor based novel technique to not only monitor levels but also study real time interaction of antigens with antibodies using QCM Piezo-immunosensor. This quantitative label free peptide based assay can be used to characterize cell surface antigen, to study antigen- antibody interactions and obtain understanding of mechanisms of resistance to therapy. Method: Mimotope was used as a substitute for the antigen like CD20 and HER2 receptor protein in QCM assays to detect mAb level. The validation samples were prepared from the standard T solution in 10% human serum at three concentrations (10, 20 and 40 ug/ml). The changes in frequencies (\u0394F) of sera from 3 female patients were obtained by calculating the differences between frequency shifts in pre and post mAb infusion. mAb level was calculated by equation, (\u0394F +1.0022) \u00f7 0.9997 \u03bcg / ml. The real-time processes of attachment of Cells like Raji cells on the gold electrode and the subsequent binding of antibody like Rituximab to the cells were studied using QCM biosensor. The interaction between Antigen and Antibody led to the increased resonant frequency shifts (df0) in the studied antibody concentration range from 5 to 250 \u03bcg mL-1 . Control experiments using other therapeutic antibodies (i.e., Trastuzumab and Bevacizumab) and different cells (i.e., T cells and endothelial cells) proved very specific interaction between Rituximab and CD20 antigens on B cells Results: Antigen and Antibody binding was very specific. This binding decreased the electrochemical activity and stability of the cells, supporting the cell lysis mechanisms of action of Rituximab. We showed that assay sensitivity was dependent upon the amino acids used to tether and link the peptide to the sensor surface and the buffers used. QCM assay was capable of detecting mAb like Trastuzumab serum level as low as 0.038 nM (linear operating range of 0.038-0.859 nM). The time frame of assay was 20-30 minutes. These results were in concordance with previously published results using ELISA. We have shown a systematic approach for using QCM technique to quantify the apparent binding constant between antigen and antibody can reveal antigen density. Conclusion: We have established a low cost, highly sensitive, fast, synthetic peptide based QCM assay which could be used as a basis for developing a new generation of affinity-based Immunosensor assays to monitor mAb serum levels like Rituximab, Trastuzumab and other monoclonal antibodies, helping physicians to determine the clinical efficacy of these drugs and ensuring appropriate dosages. Moreover antigen density and interactions of antigens with respective monoclonal antibodies like CD20 with Rituximab will help physicians to determine the clinical efficacy and resistance mechanisms to targeted antibodies like Rituximab and Ofatumumab. This could be used as a basis for developing a new generation of affinity-based Immunosensor assays. Our study shows that peptide mimotopes have potential benefit in sensor applications as the peptide-peptide interactions in the peptide mimotopes could be manipulated by the addition of functional groups to the peptide to influence binding of the target protein as well as for surface immobilization.
