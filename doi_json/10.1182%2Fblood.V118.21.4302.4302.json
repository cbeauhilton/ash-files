    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4302 This paper explores the preparation of As 2 O 3 nanoparticles and examines their antitumor effects on NB4 cells. As 2 O 3 nanoparticles were prepared using the sol-gel method and characterized by transmission election microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The results indicated that As 2 O 3 nanoparticles prepared in our study were round or elliptical, well dispersed, and about 40 nm or less than 10 nm in diameter. The antitumor effects of As 2 O 3 nanoparticles at various concentrations were analyzed by the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and flow cytometry (FCM) and were compared with those of traditional As 2 O 3 solution. At the same concentration and incubation time (48 h), the survival rate of cells treated with As 2 O 3 nanoparticles was significantly lower than that of cells treated with As 2 O 3 solution. The inhibition rate under both treatments was time- and dose-dependent. In addition, at the some concentration and incubation time, the apoptosis ratio of cells treated with As 2 O 3 nanoparticles was significantly higher than that of cells treated with As 2 O 3 solution. Furthermore, As 2 O 3 nanoparticles resulted in a greater reduction in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 compared with As 2 O 3 solution. In conclusion, AS 2 O 3 nanoparticles, prepared by sol-gel method, produce a stronger cytotoxic effect on tumor cells than As 2 O 3 solution, possibly through inhibiting Bcl-2 expression.
