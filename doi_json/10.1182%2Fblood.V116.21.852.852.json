    "abstract_text": "Abstract 852 Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive disease with <30% long-term survival. This relatively poor outcome can be explained in part by an increased frequency of high-risk molecular subtypes compared to childhood ALL, such as BCR/ABL (20%-40% in adults vs 2%-5% in children). We hypothesized that aberrant epigenetic gene regulation contributes to the pathogenesis and clinical features of adult ALL. We therefore performed genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression microarray studies of 215 adult patients with B-lineage ALL enrolled in the ECOG E2993 phase III trial. Patients had a median follow-up 4.75 years (3.5 months to 13 years) and median age 39 years (17 to 63 years). BCR/ABL (+) cases (n=83) had a worse overall survival (OS, p=0.08) than BCR/ABL (-) cases (n=132). The smaller difference in survival in this series between BCR/ABL(+) and (-) cases is likely due to the use of imatinib in some of these patients. The HELP microarray assay was used to measure DNA methylation at 50,000 CpGs annotated to \u223c22,000 RefSeq promoters. The accuracy of HELP was confirmed by extensive quantitative single locus validation studies. Supervised analysis revealed the presence of a markedly aberrant DNA methylation signature (166 genes) in BCR/ABL (+) ALL with the cutoff values of p1, and a differential gene expression profile of 416 genes at p1. Integrative analysis of expression and DNA methylation indicated that many of these genes are functionally connected within a gene network centered around IL8, which was over expressed and hypomethylated in BCR/ABL (+) cases, along with IL2RA(CD25), CEBPB, ABL1, ID1, IL15, BCL2L13, CD69, NOV, S100A8 and S100A9 . KEGG and BioCarta pathway analysis also showed enrichment for IL8 signaling, NF-kB Activation, B Cell Development and Antigen Presentation pathways, suggesting these cytokine networks might play central and distinct roles in BCR/ABL (+) ALL. To identify a core set of functionally relevant genes, we explored the overlap of the DNA methylation and gene expression signatures. The overlap consisted of 13 genes, among which 11 showed inverse correlation, including CD200, GAB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, IL2RA (CD25), LST1, LTB, NOV, ROB04, S100A9, and CD38 . Consistent with previous ECOG findings, CD25 positivity was a more dominant predictor than BCR/ABL , and could further stratify BCR/ABL (+) patients into a favorable ( CD25- ) and a poor ( CD25+ ) outcome group (OS, p=0.07). When comparing CD25 (+) and CD25 (-) groups among BCR/ABL (+) cases, we found RhoH and UBE2J1 as the top differentially methylated and IL2RA(CD25) as the top differentially expressed genes, and all three genes showed concordant corresponding changes in expression and methylation. The aberrant DNA methylation signature of MLL/AF4 cases was even more dramatic, with 469 identified as differentially methylated (p1) and 1108 genes differentially expressed (p1). Integrated analysis of DNA methylation and expression implicated gene pathways centered around TNFA and MYC , respectively. A core set of 44 genes were identified overlapping between the methylation and gene expression signatures, among which 34 showed inverse correlation, including ANXA5, BRE, CAPG, CEBPA, FAIM, FLT3, FUT4, IGFBP7, IL1R2, ITGA7, ITGAE, MAP1A, MAP7, MRPL33, PARP8, RBKS, SLITRK4 and TFR2 with overexpression and hypomethylation, and BTBD3, CCR6, FYN, GAB1, GYPC, HPS4, IL2RA, KCNK3, LCK, LST1, LTB, PRKCH, QPCT, S100A13, SGPL1 and ZAP70 with underexpression and hypermethylation in MLL/AF4 (+) ALL. All signatures were independent of B-ALL differentiation stage. Using univariate Cox Hazard Regression model adjusted by age, WBC, CD25 and BCR/ABL status, we furthermore identified 259 expression and 115 methylation markers which were significantly correlated with patient OS risk (p<0.01). Molecularly or immunophenotypically defined poor prognosis adult B- ALLs thus feature specific aberrant DNA methylation profiles with associated inversely correlated gene expression. These gene sets delineate specific biological functions that may contribute to disease phenotype and offer an opportunity for development of targeted therapy. Aberrantly methylated genes in adult B-ALL correlate with clinical risk independent of other clinical or molecular risk factors. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
