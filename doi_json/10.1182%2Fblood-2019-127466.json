    "abstract_text": "Aplastic anemia (AA) is characterized by a hypoplastic bone marrow associated with low peripheral blood counts. In acquired cases, the immune system promotes hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) depletion by the action of several pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokines. The current treatment options for severe cases consist of sibling-matched allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and immunosuppressive therapy (IST) with anti-thymocyte globulin, cyclosporine, and eltrombopag. However, most patients are not eligible for HSCT and, although about 85% of patients respond to IST with eltrombopag, a proportion of patients eventually relapse, requiring further therapies. Failure to respond adequately to immunosuppression may be attributed to the scarcity of HSPCs at the time of diagnosis. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are potentially an alternative source of patient-specific hematopoietic cells. Patient-specific HSPCs derived from in vitro iPSC differentiation may serve as a tool to study the disease as well as a source of hematopoietic tissue for cell therapies. The pyrimidoindole molecule UM171 induces ex vivo expansion of HSCs of human cord and peripheral blood and bone marrow, but the pathways modulated by this molecule are not well understood. Here we evaluated the hematopoietic differentiation potential of iPSCs obtained from patients with acquired AA. We further determined the effects of UM171 on this differentiation process. First, we derived iPSCs from 3 patients with acquired AA after treatment (1 female; average age, 31 years; 2 partial responders, 1 complete responder) and 3 healthy subjects (3 females; average age, 61 years) and induced differentiation in vitro through the embryoid body system in cell feeder and serum-free medium supplemented with cytokines. The hematopoietic differentiation of healthy-iPSCs yielded 19% \u00b1 8.1% (mean \u00b1 SEM) of CD34 + cells after 16 days in culture, in contrast with 11% \u00b1 4.9% of CD34 + cells obtained from the differentiation of AA-iPSCs, which corresponds to a 1.7-fold reduction in CD34 + cell yield. The total number of erythroid and myeloid CFUs was lower in the AA-iPSC group as compared to healthy-iPSCs (12\u00b14.2 vs. 24\u00b17.2; respectively; p <0.03). These findings suggest that erythroid-derived AA-iPSC have an intrinsic defect in hematopoietic differentiation. Next, we tested whether UM171 modulated hematopoietic differentiation of AA-iPSCs. We found that UM171 significantly stimulated the differentiation of both healthy and AA-iPSCs. In the healthy-iPSC group, the percentage of CD34 + cells was 1.9-fold higher when treated with UM171 compared to controls treated with DMSO (37% \u00b1 7.8% vs. 19% \u00b1 8.1%; respectively; p <0.03) and in AA-iPSCs the increase was 3.9-fold (45% \u00b1 11% vs. 11% \u00b1 4.9%; p <0.07). The clonogenic capacity of progenitors to produce erythroid and myeloid colonies also was augmented in both groups in comparison to DMSO (28\u00b111 vs. 23\u00b17.2) for healthy-iPSCs and for AA-iPSCs (23\u00b18.5 vs. 12\u00b14.2, p <0.06). We then investigated the molecular pathways influenced by UM171. The transcriptional profile of differentiated CD34 + cells showed that UM171 up-regulated genes involved in early hematopoiesis from mesoderm ( BRACHYURY and MIXL1) and primitive streak specification ( APELA and APLNR ), to hemangioblasts and primitive hematopoietic progenitor commitment ( TDGF1 , SOX17, and KLF5 ). We also observed the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory NF-kB activators ( MAP4K1 , ZAP70, and CARD11 ) and the anti-inflammatory gene PROCR, a marker of cultured HSCs and an NF-kB inhibitor. This balanced network has been previously suggested to be modulated by UM171 (Chagraoui et. al. Cell Stem Cell 2019). Taken together, our results showed that acquired AA-iPSCs may have intrinsic defects that impair hematopoietic differentiation in vitro. This defect may be atavic to the cell or, alternatively, the consequence of epigenetic changes in erythroid precursors provoked by the immune attack. In addition, our findings demonstrate that UM171 significantly stimulate the hematopoietic differentiation of AA-iPSCs and identified a novel molecular mechanism for UM171 as an enhancer of early hematopoietic development programs. These observations may be valuable for improving the achievement of de novo hematopoietic cells. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
