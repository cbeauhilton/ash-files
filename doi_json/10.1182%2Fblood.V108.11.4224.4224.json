    "abstract_text": "Erythropoiesis is regulated by an intricated network of transcription factors and other molecules that mediate differentiation of stem cell progenitors into erythroid lineage. PBI-1402 is a non-toxic, well-defined chemo- and radio-protective orally active small molecule which stimulates erythropoiesis. In vivo studies demonstrate that PBI-1402 has an immunorestorative effect in anemia induced by phenylhydrazine or lethal irradiation. In phenylhydrazine-induced anemia, PBI-1402 treated mice had an increased number of hematopoietic progenitor cells compared to the control mice. This increase was more pronounced in the erythroid lineage (BFU-E and CFU-E). In myeloablated mice that received a syngeneic bone marrow transplant, oral treatment with PBI-1402 resulted in a significant increase in peripheral erythrocyte count and hemoglobin concentration. In conclusion, these results indicate that PBI-1402 plays an important role in the formation of red blood cells. Therefore, PBI-1402 may be useful for the treatment of anemia associated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, bone marrow transplantation and cancer.",
