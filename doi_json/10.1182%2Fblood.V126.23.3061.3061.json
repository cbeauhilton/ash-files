    "abstract_text": "G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the most successful drug targets with 36% of currently marketed drugs targeting human GPCRs. F2r, a GPCR that is overexpressed in various human cancers (Ribeiro et al., Oncol Rep 2009), is a positive regulator of the \u03b2-catenin pathway and an inhibitor of the JNK pathway in mammalian cells (Sun et al., Nat Cell Biol 2001). The expression of F2r is significantly elevated in aggressive leukemias including blast phase of CML and AML (Veiga et al., Blood Cells Mol Dis 2011). While these observations implicate an involvement of F2r in human leukemia, its function in AML remains unknown. Our preliminary data showed that shRNA-mediated knockdown of F2r markedly decreased active \u03b2-catenin in MLL-AF9 mediated pre-leukemia stem cells (pre-LSCs) and leukemia stem cells (LSCs), confirming that F2r is a positive regulator of \u03b2-catenin. F2r deficiency decreased LSC colony formation (p=0.0002) in a serial replating assay, indicating a reduction in self-renewal capacity. Furthermore, LSCs exhibited a significant enhancement in apoptotic activity in response to F2r deficiency, displaying a 12-fold increase in apoptosis. Our microarray expression analysis revealed that F2r inhibition significantly reduced the expression of several genes responsible for maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and energy metabolism (mtND4L (p=0.0013), mtND2 (p<0.0001) and mtCytB (p<0.0001)). To investigate this further we used a mitochondria-specific fluorogenic probe to measure reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. A significant increase in ROS production (p=0.0003) indicated that F2r inhibition destabilizes the mitochondrial membrane. This was accompanied by a marked increase, as observed by Western blot analysis, in the proapoptotic proteins Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim) and thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) which permeabilize the mitochondrial membrane releasing cytochrome c and inducing apoptosis. Through oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria play an essential role in the supply of metabolic energy (ATP) to the cell. F2r deficient LSCs had a significantly reduced rate of oxygen consumption measured using a phosphorescent oxygen probe (p=0.0066) and a significantly lower concentration of basal ATP (p=0.012) compared to control LSCs. F2r inhibition, therefore, induces substantial oxidative stress which triggers the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. To assess the therapeutic value of F2r inhibition, we used the selective non-peptide F2r inhibitor SCH79797. Alamar blue-based cell viability assays showed that SCH79797 was potent against LSCs and had no cytotoxic effects on lineage-negative normal mouse bone marrow cells. F2r inhibitor treatment resulted in a 2-fold reduction in colony forming ability, 3.8-fold enhanced ROS production and inhibited \u03b2-catenin activity. BrdU labeling revealed a significant reduction in in vivo short-term proliferation of LSCs that were pre-treated with SCH79797 for 48 hours in culture, transplanted into recipient mice and collected from bone marrow 8 days post-transplantation (p=0.0008). Additional in vivo studies using a mouse model of MLL AML are currently ongoing to further evaluate the therapeutic potential of F2r inhibition. Collectively, our findings suggest that F2r inhibition selectively targets LSC self-renewal, identifying a therapeutic window to eliminate LSCs while preserving normal blood cells. Previous studies suggest that F2r knockdown not only suppresses \u03b2-catenin but also activates JNK signaling. Consistently, our Western blot analysis revealed activation of JNK in response to inhibition of F2r. Sustained JNK activation has been reported in many types of AML cells and promotes survival signals during leukemia development (Hess et al., Nat Genet 2002). This suggests that JNK and F2r inhibition could be used in combination to impair LSC self-renewal, with a concurrent increase in cell death. In support of this hypothesis, we have showed that co-inhibition of F2r and JNK induced a potent anti-LSC effect, significantly increasing cell death and ROS production compared to single treatment. The efficacy of this co-treatment is currently being evaluated in primary human AML patient samples in addition to our in vivo mouse model system. Altogether our data suggest a novel LSC-eliminating treatment strategy targeting F2r/\u03b2-catenin/JNK signaling for aggressive AML. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
