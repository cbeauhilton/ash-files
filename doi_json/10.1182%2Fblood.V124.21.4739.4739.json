    "abstract_text": "Background: Carfilzomib is an epoxy ketone, second generation proteasome inhibitor approved for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. It has shown very high activity when combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma. This is the first reported trial of carfilzomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (CCyD) in newly-diagnosed, transplant eligible patients. Methods: This study was a multi-center Phase Ib, open-label, dose-finding study in newly diagnosed transplant eligible multiple myeloma patients (pts) studying the combination of CCyD as induction therapy prior to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Pts could receive a minimum of 4 cycles and up to 6 cycles prior to ASCT. Pts were enrolled into a dose-escalation treatment cohort. A standard 3+3 dose escalation schedule was used with cohorts of carfilzomib 36 (initial), 45 and 56 mg/m 2 (administered over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16) combined with 300 mg/m 2 of oral cyclophosphamide weekly on days 1, 8, 15 and 40 mg of oral dexamethasone once weekly. Adverse events (AEs) were graded by NCI-CTCAE v4. Response was assessed by the IMWG criteria. Prior therapy was limited to up to 160 mg of dexamethasone or limited field radiation. Results: 28 patients were enrolled from 5 centers. Of 28 patients enrolled, 3 did not complete 4 cycles of therapy (1 proceeded to ASCT after Cycle 3) and are not evaluable for response (pts came off secondary to AE of pulmonary HTN unrelated, secondary to SAE of CHF possibly related, due to PI discretion related to maximum benefit achieved), 8 patients did not undergo ASCT (1 had PD after Cycle 5), 8 patients proceeded to ASCT (1 the aforementioned patient after Cycle 3), 6 patients have completed induction and are still pre-transplant and 4 patients are still on treatment. The median age was 64 years (range 44\u201374), 57% were male. Cytogenetic abnormalities included 13 patients with del(13), 4 with del(17p), 2 with t(14;16) and 1 with hypodiploidy for a total of 16 patients with high-risk cytogenetics. In the dose-escalation portion of the study, the maximum administered dose tested was 56 mg/m2 carfilzomib. There was one DLT in cycle 1, of Grade 3 dyspnea, at the 56 mg/m2 level. Drug-related AEs occurring in >20% of patients included fatigue (23%) and thrombocytopenia (31%). Thirty-one percent experienced at least one Grade \u22653 AE with dyspnea and nausea as the most common. There were no deaths on study with a median follow-up of 4.9m (range: 1.1 to 13.1m). One pt came off study after Cycle 5 for PD as evidenced by new plasmacytomas. Six patients received 36-45 mg/m2 carfilzomib on the dose escalation portion of this study and 22 patients received the maximum administered dose of carfilzomib at 56 mg/m2. One patient yet to be enrolled to obtain 20 efficacy evaluable pts at the maximum dose. Twenty-three patients were response evaluable. Median of 5.7 cycles of therapy with 2 CR, 9 VGPR, 10 PR, 1 MR and 1 PD for \u2265 PR rate of 91%. Of the 12 response-evaluable patients with high risk cytogenetics, 92% were \u2265 PR; of the 11 standard risk patients, 91% were \u2265 PR. Of 9 patients who underwent stem cell mobilization, all collected adequate stem cells and median number of stem cells collected was 12.58 (5.07-25.31) x106 CD34+ cells/kg. Conclusions: The combination of CCyD given to untreated, symptomatic patients with myeloma was well tolerated and highly active with an 87% RR and a 48% \u2265 VGPR after 4 to 6 cycles. This study compares favorably with other regimens used for induction prior to transplant for the management of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
