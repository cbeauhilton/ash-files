    "abstract_text": "Oncogenic mutations of the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase have been identified in several malignancies including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), systemic mastocytosis (SM), seminomas/dysgerminomas and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Mutations in the regulatory juxtamembrane domain are common in GIST, while mutations in the activation loop of the kinase (most commonly D816V) occur predominantly in SM and at low frequency in AML. Several ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors, including imatinib, are effective against juxtamembrane KIT mutants, however, the D816V mutant is largely resistant to inhibition. We analyzed the sensitivities of cell lines expressing wild type KIT, juxtamembrane mutant KIT (V560G) and activation loop mutant KIT (D816V,F,Y and murine D814Y) to a potent Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, AP23464, and analogs. IC50 values for inhibition of cellular KIT phosphorylation by AP23464 were 5\u201311 nM for activation loop mutants, 70 nM for the juxtamembrane mutant and 85 nM for wild type KIT. Consistent with this, IC50 values in cell proliferation assays were 3\u201320 nM for activation loop mutants and 100 nM for wild type KIT and the juxtmembrane mutant. In activation loop mutant-expressing cell lines, AP23464, at concentrations \u226450 nM, induced apoptosis, arrested the cell cycle in G0/G1 and down-regulated phosphorylation of Akt and STAT3, signaling pathways critical for the transforming capacity of mutant KIT. In contrast, 500 nM AP23464 was required to induce equivalent effects in wild-type KIT and juxtamembrane mutant-expressing cell lines. These data demonstrate that activation loop KIT mutants are considerably more sensitive to inhibition by AP23464 than wild type or juxtamembrane mutant KIT. Non-specific toxicity in parental cells occurred only at concentrations above 2 \u03bcM. Additionally, at concentrations below 100 nM, AP23464 did not inhibit formation of granulocyte/macrophage and erythrocyte colonies from normal bone marrow, suggesting that therapeutic drug levels would not impact normal hematopoiesis. We also examined in vivo target inhibition in a mouse model. Mice were subcutaneously injected with D814Y-expressing (D816V homologous) murine mastocytoma cells. Once tumors were established, compound was administered three-times daily by oral gavage. One hour post treatment we observed >90% inhibition of KIT phosphorylation in tumor tissue. Following a three-day treatment regimen, there was a statistically significant difference in tumor size compared to controls. Thus, AP23464 analogs effectively target D816-mutant KIT both in vitro and in vivo and inhibit activation loop KIT mutants more potently than the wild type protein. These data provide evidence that this class of kinase inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for D816V-expressing malignancies such as SM or AML.",
