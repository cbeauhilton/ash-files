    "abstract_text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are widely used in the treatment of lymphoma and autoimmune diseases. The activity of several mAbs depends on the binding of the Fc \u03b3 regions to low-affinity Fc \u03b3 receptors (Fc \u03b3 R) expressed on effector cells, chiefly mononuclear phagocytes, cells that express both activating and inhibitory Fc \u03b3 Rs. Fc \u03b3 RIIB (CD32B), the inhibitory Fc \u03b3 R, is expressed by normal and malignant B lymphocytes and is itself an immunotherapeutic target. A recently characterized anti-human CD32B-specific mAb (2B6) was Fc engineered to customize the Fc \u03b3 R binding profile for increased binding to the activating receptor Fc \u03b3 RIIIA (CD16A), resulting in an improved activating-to-inhibitory binding ratio. Fc-optimized versions of 2B6 showed enhanced cytotoxicity in vitro and increased potency in animal tumor models, including transgenic mice harboring the human low-affinity allele of the activating receptor, CD16A-158 phe . The enhancement in tumor depletion correlated with an increased binding to Fc \u03b3 RIV, a mouse functional homolog to human CD16A. The expression of Fc \u03b3 RIV is limited to monocyte and macrophages, consistent with the role of these cells in tumor cell killing in vivo. These data support CD32B as a target for immunotherapy of B cell lymphoproliferative disorders and Fc optimization to increase the activating-to-inhibitory Fc \u03b3 R-binding ratio as a means to designing improved antibodies."
