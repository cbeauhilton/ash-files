    "abstract_text": "IRF-4 and IRF-8 are related interferon regulatory factors that are required for the development and function of myeloid and lymphoid cells. Mice deficient in IRF-8 develop a myeloproliferative disorder with many similarities to human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Our group has shown that in B-lymphocyte development, IRF-4 and 8 function redundantly to control the pre-B to B transition. Though expression of IRF-4 has been demonstrated in myeloid cells, its role in these lineages has not been defined. We hypothesized that, similar to their role in B-cells, IRF-4 and 8 may to some extent function redundantly in myeloid cells. To test this hypothesis, myelopoiesis was analyzed in IRF-4/8 double knockout (DKO) mice. We found that from seven weeks of age, the DKO animals have a more aggressive leukemic phenotype than the IRF-8 KO mice. The white blood cell (WBC) counts of DKO animals were typically in the range of 40,000 to 80,000 cells per microliter, campared to 15,000 to 20,000 for age-matched IRF-8 KO animals. FACS analysis showed that the increased WBCs in the DKO animals was due to a massive expansion of mature granulcytes. The absolute granulocyte counts of DKO animals were typically 7-fold to 10-fold higher than those of IRF-8 KO animals. In addition, histologic preparations showed that by 15 weeks of age the spleens, lymph nodes, and bone marrow of DKO animals were invaded by large numbers of mature granulocytes and pseudo-Gaucher cells, with complete effacement of the normal micro-architecture. Age-matched IRF-8 KO animals showed invasion to a lesser degree, with preservation of many of the normal architectural features. In conclusion, IRF-4 is an important myeloid tumor suppressor, whose loss augments the myeloproliferative disease manifested in IRF-8 deficient mice. This suggests the two transcription factors, similar to their role in B-cell development, function redundantly to control the normal maturation of myeloid-lineage cells."
