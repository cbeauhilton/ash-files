    "abstract_text": "The immunologically hostile microenviroment of multiple Myeloma may contribute to the limited success of immunotherapy strategies. In addition to direct tumour-induced immunosuppression, tumour cells may generate suppressor cells to further suppress the immune effectors. Regulatory T-cells profoundly suppress immune responses and induce tolerance and 2 main subsets have been identified: Naturally Occurring T Reg cells and Inducible regulatory Tr-1 cells. The association between tumour cells and regulatory T cells has not been studied in haematological malignancies, especially those of B lymphocyte lineages. Therefore, this the aim of this study is to determine if regulatory T-cell subsets are increased in the peripheral blood of patients with MM and how this varies with increasing disease burden. Peripheral blood from patients with MM (De novo, n=3; Low Disease burden, n=19; Relapsed/Refractory Disease, n=11) and MGUS (n=6) with a median age of 69 years old (range 39\u201389 yrs) were analysed by flow cytometry and compared to age-sex matched controls (n=20, median age 60 yrs, range 33\u201380 yrs). Whilst there was no significant difference in the absolute lymphocyte counts between MM patients and controls (1.58x10 9 /l \u00b10.14 vs. 1.9x10 9 /l \u00b10.1, p=0.05) a significant CD4 + T-cell lymphopenia was noted in patients with MM compared to controls (393\u00b162 cells/\u03bcl vs. 849\u00b195 cells/\u03bcl, p<0.001). The CD4 + T-cell lymphopenia was most marked in patients with relapsed/refractory disease (462\u00b1114 cells/\u03bcl) and low tumour burden (380\u00b185 cells/\u03bcl) compared with newly diagnosed patients (875\u00b164 cells/\u03bcl, p<0.001), MGUS (945\u00b190 cells/\u03bcl, p<0.001) and controls (849\u00b195 cells/\u03bcl, p<0.001). Using a sequential gating strategy, T Reg cells were identified as CD4\u00b1/CD25 + /GITR + T-cells and expressed as a percentage of the CD4 + T-cell population. Overall, patients with MM demonstrated a significant increase in the T Reg cell population compared to the control group (15.0%\u00b12.5 vs. 7.2%\u00b11.1, p<0.001). The increased T Reg cell population was most marked in patients with relapsed/refractory disease (13.6%\u00b11.5) and low tumour burden (16%\u00b11.9) compared with newly diagnosed patients (6.7%\u00b11.0, p<0.001), MGUS (10.8%\u00b11.7, p=0.03) and controls (7.2%\u00b11.1, p<0.001). Tr1 cells were analysed using an in-house assay and identified on a sequential gating strategy as CD4 + /IL-10 + /IL-4 \u2212 T-cells and expressed as a percentage of the CD4 + T-cell population. Overall, patients with MM demonstrated an increase in the Tr1 cell population compared to the control group (14.5%\u00b15.5 vs. 9.8%\u00b11.0) though the trend did not reach statistical significance (p=0.23). Similarly, an alteration in the Th1/Th2 balance was seen with an increase in the Th2 cell population compared to the control group (6.3%\u00b13 vs. 2.8%\u00b10.1) though the trend did not reach statistical significance (p=0.15). These results provide further evidence of immune dysregulation in patients with MM and suggest that tumour-associated immunosuppression may be mediated through the actions of regulatory T-cell subsets. In particular, the association with advanced disease stage suggests a casual association between the malignant cells and induction of immune regulatory cells. Further work in establishing a casual association between MM tumour cells and regulatory T-cells is on-going and is essential if immunotherapeutic strategies are ever to reach their full potential.",
