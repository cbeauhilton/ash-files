This study aimed to prospectively assess the efficacy of the sequential deferiprone\u2013deferrioxamine (DFP-DFO) versus deferiprone (DFP) and deferrioxamine (DFO) in monotherapy in a large cohort of TM patients by quantitative MR. Methods: Among the first 1135 TM patients enrolled in the MIOT (Myocardial Iron Overload in Thalassemia) network, 392 patients performed a MR follow up study at 18\u00b13 months. We evaluated prospectively the 35 patients treated with DFP-DFO versus the 39 patients treated with DFP and the 74 patients treated with DFO between the 2 MR scans. Iron concentrations were measured by T2* multiecho technique. Biventricular function parameters were quantitatively evaluated by cine images. Results: Excellent/good levels of compliance were similar in the DFP-DFO (97.1%) versus DFP (94.9%) and DFO (95.9%) groups. No significant differences were found in the frequency of side effects in DFP-DFO (15.6%) versus DFP group (9.4%). The percentage of patients who maintained a normal global heart T2* value (\u226520 ms) was comparable between DFP-DFO (96%) versus DFP (100%) and DFO (98.1%) groups. Among the patients with myocardial iron overload (MIO) at baseline (global heart T2*<20 ms), in all three groups there was a significant improvement in the global heart T2* value (DFO-DFP: P=0.004, DFP: P=0.015 and DFO: ms P=0.007) and a significant reduction in the number of pathological segments (DFO-DFP: P=0.026, DFP: P=0.012 and DFO: P=0.002). In DFO-DFP and DFP groups there was a significant increment in the left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) (P=0.035 and P=0.045, respectively) as well as in the right ventricular (RV) EF (P=0.017 and P=0.001, respectively). The improvement in the global heart T2* and in biventricular function were not significantly different in DFO-DFP compared to the other groups ( Table 1 ). Table 1.

Liver T2*changes were not significantly different in DFO-DFP versus the other groups. Conclusions: Prospectively we did not find significant differences on cardiac and hepatic iron or in cardiac function in TM patients treated with sequential DFP\u2013DFO therapy versus the TM patients treated with DFO or DFP in monotherapy.
