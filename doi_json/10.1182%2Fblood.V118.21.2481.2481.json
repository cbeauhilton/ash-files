    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2481 Ponatinib (AP24534) is a pan-BCR-ABL inhibitor developed for treatment-refractory chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and has significant activity in patients who fail second-line dasatinib and/or nilotinib tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. A pivotal phase II trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01207440 ) is underway. BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation-mediated ponatinib resistance has been investigated in vitro ( Cancer Cell 16, 2009, 401). Here, we developed ponatinib-resistant, BCR-ABL+ cell lines lacking a kinase domain mutation and investigated mechanisms of resistance to ponatinib and other TKIs. Methods: Four BCR-ABL+ CML cell lines (K562, AR230, BV173, and 32D(BCR-ABL)) were maintained in liquid culture containing ponatinib (0.1 nM) for 10 days. The ponatinib concentration was increased in small increments for a minimum of 90 days, yielding corresponding ponatinib-resistant cell lines. BCR-ABL kinase domain sequencing of sensitive and resistant cells confirmed BCR-ABL to be unmutated. Real-time qPCR was used to compare the expression of BCR-ABL in ponatinib-sensitive and -resistant cell lines. Immunoblot analysis (total and tyrosine-phosphorylated BCR-ABL) was used to the compare levels of BCR-ABL protein and to determine whether resistance to ponatinib corresponded with reduced ( partially BCR-ABL-independent ) or complete inhibition of BCR-ABL tyrosine phosphorylation ( fully BCR-ABL-independent ). Cell proliferation assays were performed on resistant and sensitive cell lines in the presence of ponatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib. A small-molecule inhibitor screen composed of >90 cell-permeable inhibitors that collectively target the majority of the tyrosine kinome as well as other kinases ( Blood 116, 2010, abstract 2754) is currently being applied to the 32D(BCR-ABL) R cell line in the presence of 24 nM ponatinib to assess synthetic lethality, with results analyzed using a companion drug sensitivity algorithm. As a second strategy to generate resistant lines, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis was done to investigate BCR-ABL kinase domain-mediated resistance in myeloid K562, AR230, BV173, and 32D(BCR-ABL) cells. After ENU exposure, cells were washed and cultured in 96-well plates with escalating ponatinib. Results: The four BCR-ABL+ cell lines initially grew in the presence of 0.1 nM but not 0.5 nM ponatinib. Upon gradual exposure to escalating ponatinib, each of the cell lines exhibited a degree of adaptation to growth in the presence of the inhibitor (range: 10 to 240-fold). Real-time qPCR showed a modest two-fold increase in BCR-ABL expression level in K562 R , AR230 R and BV173 R cell lines relative to the respective parental lines. Based on immunoblot analysis, cell lines segregated into two categories of ponatinib resistance: partially (K562 R and AR230 R ) or fully BCR-ABL-independent (BV173 R and 32D(BCR-ABL) R ). Cell proliferation assays showed that ponatinib resistant cell lines also exhibited resistance to nilotinib and dasatinib. The 32D(BCR-ABL) R cell line exhibited a level of ponatinib resistance comparable to that of the Ba/F3 BCR-ABL E255V cell line, which carries the most ponatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutation. BCR-ABL tyrosine phosphorylation was efficiently blocked by low concentrations of ponatinib (<5 nM) in the 32D(BCR-ABL) R cell line, yet these cells remained viable in the presence of up to 24 nM ponatinib. The effects of providing a second kinase inhibitor along with ponatinib (24 nM) in order to probe for synthetic lethality are under study. Possible involvement of a second, moderately ponatinib-sensitive target is suggested by the sharp ponatinib maximum at 24 nM; even 26 nM ponatinib is toxic to 32D(BCR-ABL) R cells. Thus far, ENU mutagenesis screens in human CML cell lines failed to yield resistant clones and only a few were recovered from the murine 32D(BCR-ABL) R cell line (3/1440 wells; the only BCR-ABL mutant recovered was BCR-ABL L387F ). Conclusions: The ponatinib resistant, BCR-ABL+ cell lines described here exhibit either a partially or fully BCR-ABL independent mechanism of resistance. The molecular details of both processes will be reported, with an emphasis on the striking level of resistance (240-fold over starting conditions) exhibited by the 32D(BCR-ABL) R cell line. Our in vitro results indicate that BCR-ABL independent mechanisms may contribute to ponatinib resistance in myeloid CML cells. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
