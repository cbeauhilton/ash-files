    "abstract_text": "Background: Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are increasingly used as a source of stem cells for either autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation in children.Although technically similar to adult procedures, PBSC harvest may be difficult in young children, especially in the very small children. Aim : In this study, we aimed to evaluatethe safety and efficacy of harvesting peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells in very small children,and to provide a guideline. Methods: Between Jan 2013 to Mar 2016, we evaluated 118 children weighing 20 kg or less, with the smallest patient weighing 11 kg. The patients had a median age of 59 months and included 72 children with thalassemia major and 46 young donors. The granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) analogs were used at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day administered subcutaneously once a day and receiving oral calcium for five days before harvesting. Blood was withdrawn at a mean rate of 30-40 ml/min through a temporaryfemoral vein catheter (12 or 14 guage) to ensure adequate blood flow and returned through a larger catheter in a peripheral vein.Total nucleated cells(TNC) and CD34+ cells were estimated in the peripheral blood before collection of the apheresis product. Results : We collected sufficient products from all the children with one to three apheresis procedures. No serious complication was detected in all children and all aphereses were completed within 4 hours.The volume of blood per kilogram processed for each apheresis ranged from 55 to 160ml (median, 85ml). The median number of TNC and CD34+ cells collected were 12\u00d710 8 /kg and 15\u00d710 6 /kg per apheresis, respectively. Conclusions: We conclude that collection of PBSC is a safe and practical procedure in children, even in very small children. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
