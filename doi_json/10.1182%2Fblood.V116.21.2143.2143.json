    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2143 Background: The outcome of adults with relapsed/refractory ALL, and of those whose disease recurs after first salvage, in particular, is extremely poor. Second salvage therapy with single agents has historically produced a complete response (CR) in only 4% of patients. (O'Brien, S, et al. Cancer 2008; 113:3186-3191). Third salvage therapy has not been studied but would be expected to be even less effective. Conventional vincristine sulfate (VCR) is an effective anti-leukemia agent, widely used in the treatment of ALL as part of several intensive regimens. VCR is dosed at 1.4 mg/m 2 with a 2 mg cap due to early onset of peripheral neuropathy. VSLI (Marqibo) is a nano-particle encapsulated formulation of VCR designed to facilitate dose intensification, improve duration of drug exposure, and enhance cancer and bone marrow drug delivery. Methods: Two distinct studies investigated VSLI in adult patients with advanced, relapsed/refractory ALL. Study VSLI-06 was a Phase 1/2, multi-center, 36 patient, dose-escalation study to determine safety, maximum tolerated dose, and anti-leukemia activity. Patients received VSLI intravenously (IV) weekly at doses of 1.5, 1.825, 2.0, 2.25 or 2.4 mg/m 2 with no dose cap plus dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1\u20134 and 11\u201314 of each 4 week cycle. The RALLY Study was a Phase 2, multi-national, 65 patient study of single-agent VSLI (2.25 mg/m 2 IV weekly without dose cap) in adults with ALL in second relapse or who had progressed following at least two prior lines of anti-leukemia therapy. All subjects had been previously treated with VCR, and all received at least one dose of VSLI. The median age in both studies was 32 years with a combined range of 19 to 83 years. Other than one subject in VSLI-06, all subjects were Philadelphia chromosome negative. Results: The combined overall response rate was 31% (31 of 101). The combined complete response (CR) rate including CR with incomplete platelet (CRp) or hematologic (CRi) recovery was 20% (20/101). This response rate was consistent across the studies (19.4% and 20%, respectively). Hematologic improvement (HI) was achieved in 4 patients (11%) in VSLI-06 and 9 (14%) in RALLY, thus reducing transfusions and hospital visits. Five patients were able to receive a post-VSLI hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in VSLI-06, and 10 patients were able to receive a post-VSLI HSCT in RALLY.

Conclusion: These two studies totaling 101 patients with similar populations of advanced relapsed/refractory ALL showed a combined 20% CR/CRp/CRi rate, dwarfing the rate in historical studies. This is particularly encouraging, given that 100% of subjects had received prior VCR and that historical control data were largely in a less heavily pre-treated population. Both VSLI alone and combined with pulse dexamethasone appear to be highly active. In total, 15% of combined study patients were able to \u201cbridge\u201d to HSCT. Use of VSLI in the frontline setting and in combination regimens should further improve ALL patient outcomes. Disclosures: Messerschmidt: Hana Biosciences, Inc.: Employment.
