    "abstract_text": "Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of tryptophan into kynurenine, has been identified as a novel immunosuppressive agent by inhibiting T-cell proliferation and is involved in tolerance induction to tumors. We have recently shown that IDO protein is constitutively expressed in a significant subset of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, resulting in tryptophan catabolism along the kynurenine pathway and in the inhibition of allogeneic T-cell proliferation. Moreover, we demonstrated that IDO-expressing AML cells are capable to promote the differentiation of new CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + T regulatory cells (Treg cells). AML cells may be differentiated into leukemic dendritic cells (AML-DCs) which have increased immunogenicity and may be used as vaccine against leukemia. We in vitro generated DCs from 7 AML samples according to standard procedures and tested IDO expression and activity. At baseline, 5/7 AML samples expressed IDO, whereas 2/7 did not. After differentiation into DCs, IDO + AML samples showed an up-regulation of IDO mRNA and protein, and IDO \u2212 AML cells turned positive. IDO-expressing AML-DCs were capable to catabolize tryptophan into kynurenine metabolite and, functionally, they inhibited allogeneic T-cell proliferation through an IDO-dependent mechanism. Similarly to undifferentiated IDO + AML blasts, IDO-expressing AML-DCs induced a population of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + Treg cells, which were capable to suppress in vitro allogeneic nai\u0308ve T-cell proliferation. These data identify IDO-mediated catabolism as a general tolerogenic mechanism in AML cells, including AML-DCs and raise several concerns for the use of AML-DCs as cellular vaccine against leukemia."
