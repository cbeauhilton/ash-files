    "abstract_text": "CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, is expressed in all human B-cell malignancies and engagement by the CD40 ligand (CD40L) is important for both cell proliferation and cell survival. CD40L has been shown to be co-expressed with CD40 in neoplastic B-cells from Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (NHL), suggesting the importance of an autocrine CD40/CD40L loop in these malignancies. HCD122 (formerly known as CHIR-12.12) is a fully human, highly potent, IgG1 antagonist anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that blocks CD40/CD40L interactions in vitro and also mediates ADCC. Previous studies showed that HCD122 can mediate ADCC in vitro and has anti-proliferative and anti-tumor activities as a single agent in CLL, MM, and Burkitts Lymphoma in vitro and in vivo. In this study, the activity of HCD122 on a subtype of NHL, Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) was examined. The DLBCL derived cell lines, RL and SU-DHL-4, were selected for this study based upon in vivo characterization as well as their sensitivity to Rituximab as reported in the literature. These cell lines were subsequently confirmed for the expression of CD40 and CD20 by flow cytometry. The in vivo anti-tumor effects of HCD122 as single agent was demonstrated in these two xenograft models and was compared to Rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody therapeutic currently approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular, NHL. HCD122 when administered intraperitoneally weekly at 1 mg/kg significantly reduced tumor growth with a tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 85.5% (P0.05). In the SU-DHL-4 model, an 85% TGI (P<0.01) was observed at the 1 mg/kg dose of HCD122. In comparison, Rituximab at this dose elicited a 57.6% TGI (P<0.05). Additionally, the downstream CD40/CD40L signal transduction pathways were also examined in order to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the HCD122-mediated effects in DLBCL. Taken together, these results support the clinical development of HCD122 for the treatment of DLBCL. Currently HCD122 is in Phase I trials for treatment of CLL and MM."
