    "abstract_text": "Abstract 539 HIT is an immune thrombocytopenia associated with a high risk of developing thrombosis. A passive immunization murine model of this disorder has provided important insights into the underlying pathogenesis of this disease, but is limited by its inability to study human cells and limited ability to define the contribution of various hematopoeitic and vascular cells to the prothrombotic state. We used a microfluidic system in conjunction with flow cytometry to further our understanding of the prothrombotic nature of HIT. Platelet adhesion and aggregation was studied in whole blood labeled with Calcein AM, perfused through a microfluidic channel (BioFlux 200 system, Fluxion) coated with von Willebrand factor (vWf) at shear stress of 20 dyne/cm 2 at 37\u00b0C. A 40\u201360% increase in platelet adhesion (relative area covered by platelets) with up to a 4 fold increase in average aggregate size was seen in the presence of the pathogenic HIT-like monoclonal antibody (moAb) KKO (50 \u03bcg/ml) in conjunction with PF4 (10 \u03bcg/ml) when compared to control samples with PF4 only or with PF4 plus a non-pathogenic anti-PF4 moAb RTO (p <0.01). Monocyte-depletion decreased platelet aggregation by 20 \u2013 40% relative to whole blood or after monocyte-repletion (P<0.0001). In HIT, thrombin plays a key role in the formation of platelet aggregates. Addition of thrombin inhibitor PPACK to the whole blood stimulated by KKO and PF4 decreased thrombus formation in the microfluidic chamber by 40% (p<0.001). Coated platelets are prothrombotic and characterized by phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and binding of FVa and FXa. This activated state requires dual stimulation via thrombin and ITAM receptors. Flow cytometric studies of annexin V and FXa binding showed extensive induction of coated platelets in whole blood by KKO plus PF4 in contrast to PF4 or PF4 plus RTO (annexin V: p<0.0001; Factor Xa p<0.01). These new studies, focused on human blood, support our finding in the passive murine HIT model as to the importance of monocytes to thrombus formation and suggest that the prothrombotic nature of HIT may also be promoted by the generation of coated platelets. Identification of coated platelets may also lead to new diagnostic tests and new therapeutic interventions in HIT. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
