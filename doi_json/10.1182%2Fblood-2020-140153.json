    "abstract_text": "Background: Several novel agents, including venetoclax (VEN), gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), and glasdegib have shown promise in newly diagnosed AML. However, their role in relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML and their optimal combination with other agents has not been established. We therefore designed a multi-arm, parallel cohort, phase Ib/II study to evaluate various novel combinations of these agents in pts with R/R AML. Methods: Adults \u226518 years of age with R/R AML or with AML from antecedent hematologic malignancy previously treated with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) who had performance status of \u22642 and adequate organ function were eligible. Pts were assigned at the treating physician's discretion to one of 5 concomitantly enrolling arms: A.) azacitidine (AZA) + VEN + GO, B.) AZA + VEN + avelumab (anti-PDL1 mAb), C.) AZA + avelumab + GO, D.) OX40 agonist mAb (PF-04518600), or E.) glasdegib + GO. Treatment regimens are shown in Table 1 . In arms containing VEN, a bone marrow (BM) assessment was performed on cycle 1 day 21, and VEN was held if BM blasts were <5% or aplastic BM. All arms had an initial 6 pt safety lead-in for assessment of DLTs, followed by a phase II expansion. Results: As of 7/2020, 43 pts have been treated across the 5 arms. The baseline characteristics of pts enrolled in the three triplet combination arms (Arm A, n=19; Arm C, n=9; Arm D, n=6) are shown in Table 2. More than half of the pts in each group had adverse risk cytogenetics. TP53 was the most commonly mutated gene, detected in 32%, 56%, and 33% of the pts in Arms A, B and C, respectively. Nineteen pts received AZA + VEN + GO (Arm A); 18 were evaluable for response (1 pt too early). No DLTs were observed in the initial 6 pt safety lead-in. The 30-day and 60-day mortality rates were 11% and 21% in this R/R AML population. Overall, 4 pts achieved CR, 2 CRi, and 4 MLFS (CR rate: 22%; CR/CRi rate: 33%; CR/CRi/MLFS rate: 56%). Three pts proceeded to hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Eight pts (42%) had received prior VEN. The CR/CRi and CR/CRi/MLFS rates for pts without prior VEN exposure were 4/10 (40%) and 8/10 (80%), respectively. In contrast, the CR/CRi and CR/CRi/MLFS rates were both 2/8 (25%) for pts with prior VEN exposure. Five pts remain on study (3 with ongoing response). The median duration of response was 5.2 months (range, 3.1-6.3+ months), and the median overall survival (OS) was 7.3 months (median OS in VEN na\u00efve: 7.3 months; median OS in prior VEN exposed: 3.2 months). Nine pts received AZA + VEN + avelumab (Arm B); 8 were evaluable for response (1 pt too early). One pt developed a DLT of transient grade 3 possibly immune-related transaminase elevation; no other DLTs were observed. The 30-day and 60-day mortality rates were 0%. Two pts achieved CRi (25%), both of whom had prior VEN exposure. The median OS was 4.8 months. Six pts received AZA + avelumab + GO (Arm C); 5 were evaluable for response (1 pt too early). No DLTs were observed, although one pt developed possibly immune-related grade 3 diarrhea in cycle 3 that resolved with holding avelumab. All enrolled pts had prior VEN exposure. The 30-day and 60-day mortality rates were 0%. One pt responded (20%). This pt had diploid NPM1 -mutated AML with 4 prior therapies (including prior HMA + VEN) with only extramedullary disease (PET+ muscle involvement) at enrollment, and remains on study with ongoing PET-negative CR of 6+ months. Four pts were treated with PF-04518600 monotherapy (Arm D). PF-04518600 was overall safe with no DLTs or immune-related AEs. However, none of the 4 pts responded. Five pts were treated with glasdegib + GO (Arm E). One pt developed grade 3 mucositis possibly related to GO and considered a DLT. No pts had a formal response, although one pt had a BM blast reduction from 20% to 9% after 1 cycle. Conclusion: All 3 novel triplet combination regimens were safe and demonstrated preliminary efficacy even in pts with prior VEN exposure. Outcomes of AZA + VEN + GO in pts who had not received prior VEN were particularly promising with a CR/CRi/MLFS rate of 80%, which compares favorably to response rates of 50-55% with HMA + VEN in similar R/R pts, although numbers are still small. Future accrual will focus on these 3 triplet combination regimens. Evaluating the safety and early efficacy of multiple novel combinations in a single multi-arm study with clear \"go\" or \"no go\" signals is a feasible, more rapid and cost-efficient approach to be considered as multiple promising novel agents enter the AML space.
