    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Clinical features and genetic backgrounds of acute myeloid Leukemia (AML) are heterogenous and the prognosis is poor. Cooperating alterations of several genes including oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes lead to development of Leukemia. AML leukemogenesis is thought to require at least two different types of genetic change: class I mutations, which confer a proliferative or survival advantage; and class II mutations, which inhibit myeloid differentiation and apoptotic activity. In hematological malignancies with 11p15 translocations, the NUP98 gene is reportedly fused to various partner genes, often including homeobox genes, such as HOXA9, A11, A13, C11, C13, D11, D13 and PMX . We previously revealed that high frequencies of FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), NRAS mutations (NRAS MT ), and WT1 mutations (WT1 MT ) in myeloid malignancies with NUP98 - HOX fusions were found and their concurrent mutations with NUP98 - HOX fusions were associated with clinical prognosis of the patients. However, biological outcome of the combination of NUP98 - HOX fusions with FLT3-ITD, NRAS MT or WT1 MT remains to be investigated. To elucidate the mechanism resposible for the leukemogenesis, we examined the function of NUP98-HOX fusions and the concomitant somatic mutations in vitro. Methods: Full length of NUP98-HOXA9 (NHA9), FLT3-ITD (51 bp-duplication), NRAS MT (G13V), and WT1 MT (Arg250trp) was cloned into a plasmid that has a mammalian replication initiation region and a nuclear matrix attachment region, which possesses great ability to persist gene amplification for long periods. Each plasmid or the combination of the two plasmids (NHA9/FLT3-ITD, NHA9/NRAS MT , NHA9/WT1 MT ) were transfected into IL3-dependent mouse myeloid 32D cell line. Cell proliferation was determined in medium without IL3. Cellular differentiation was examined in the medium containing G-CSF using May-Giemsa staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Apoptosis was quantitated using FACS. Colony forming assay was performed in methyl cellulose medium with stem cell factor and IL3. Moreover, autophagy induced by tamoxifen was checked. Results: Compared to the empty vector, IL3-independent cellular growth was significantly increased in the cells transfected with NHA9 and FLT3-ITD alone, but not in NRAS MT and WT1 MT alone. In contrast, co-transfection of NRAS MT or WT1 MT with NHA9 significantly increased the IL3 independent proliferation of 32D cells. Similarly, cells transfected with NHA9/FLT3-ITD showed the enhanced IL3-independent proliferation. CD11b and Gr1, of which represent myeloid differentiation marker, decreased in all the transfected cells except for NRAS MT . While transfection with FLT3-ITD, NRAS MT and WT1 MT increased the morphological nuclear segmentation of the cells, NHA9/FLT3-ITD, NHA9/NRAS MT , and NHA9/WT1 MT abrogated the nuclear segmentation. Both Annexin V positive/propidium iodide negative cells and active caspase 3-positive cells declined in all transfected cells. Transfection of NHA9/FLT3-ITD, NHA9/NRAS MT , NHA9/WT1 MT tended to increase the number of colony forming unit compared to the single gene-transfected cells. After treatment with tamoxifen, monodansylcadaverine, which was used to reveal autophagic vacuoles, was incorporated into empty vector-transfected cells, not into all transfected cells. Conclusions: NHA9 acquired proliferation capacity, blockage of differentiation, and anti-apoptosis activity, FLT3-ITD did proliferation capacity and anti-apoptosis activity, NRAS MT and WT1 MT did anti-apoptosis activity. By contrast, NHA9 with FLT3-ITD, NRAS MT , or WT1 MT conferred growth advantage, inhibited differentiation and apoptosis, augmented self-renewality. In vivo study demonstrated that NHA9 or each genetic mutation (FLT3-ITD and NRAS MT ) alone was insufficient to achieve myeloid leukemia. These suggested that leukemogenesis of NUP98-HOX fusion genes with simultaneous gene mutations might be induced by not only harmonization between class I and class II mutations but also self-renewality and anti-autophagic cell death.
