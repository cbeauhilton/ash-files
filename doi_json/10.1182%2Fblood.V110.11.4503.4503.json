    "abstract_text": "It has been proved that Rituximab is a useful drug for the treatment of patients with lymphoma. Being a humanized antibody, it presents high specificity. Rituximab is a well tolerated medicine, although a slow infusion rate given in many hours is recommended to avoid reactions derived from the liberation of cytokines. As a consequence, patients need admissions for a treatment that can take hours. The recent demostration of its usefulness in the maintenance of the response of patients with follicular lymphomas has concluded in the revision of hospitalization time, proposing a faster infusion. We are presenting our experience with RIR, on a group of patients with lymphoproliferative diseases. We used RIR with the aim to observe the toxicity and to reduce the time of hospitalization in patients with lymphoma. We evaluated the adverse events and tested the feasibility of a 90 minutes infusion schedule for rituximab (20% of the dose administered in the first 30 minutes, remaining administered over 60 minutes). Premedication included oral paracetamol and intravenous hidrocortisone and diphenhydramine. Sixty seven RIR were used to treated 31 patients (27 non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and 4 Chronic Lymphocitic Leukemia). All of them had previously received one or more rituximab conventional infusion without grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Twenty nine patients received also CHOP or CHOP-like chemotherapy and the other two Rituximab alone as maintenance therapy. Overall RIR was well tolerated. There were 5 adverse events. Four patients developed grade one adverse events: one patient had an hypotension episode, one presented chest pain and the other two had abdominal pain. Only one patient developed a grade 3 adverse event (abdominal pain) and withdrew the RIR schedule. We conclude that rapid infusion rituximab is safe and well tolerated. The adoption of this schedule in clinical practice reduces in many hours the time of hospitalization for patients with lymphoma and may be a cost-effective strategy.",
