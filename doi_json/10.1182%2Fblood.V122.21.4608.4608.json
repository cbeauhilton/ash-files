    "abstract_text": "Chronic Graft versus Host Disease (cGvHD) is still the leading cause of late mortality in transplanted patients. Among the new drugs potentially useful in patients with steroid-refractory cGVHD (SR-cGVHD), the Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) Imatinib emerged as promising agent; however in our previous experiences, patient's frailty and their reduced haematological tolerance heavily limited the daily dose of Imatinib (median dose administered was 200 mg/day). Thus we planned to evaluate in the same setting a the safety and activity of a second generation TKI, such as Nilotinib (NIL), characterized by a better haematological tolerance and that could allow to treat SR-cGVHD patients with a higher relative dosage than Imatinib, thus achieving a better efficacy. Basing on this rational we designed a phase I-II study, aimed to individuate the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD) and the activity of NIL in patients with SR-cGVHD (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01810718). Primary endpoint of the phase I study was to define the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of NIL, defined as the occurrence of any grade\u22653 toxicity during at least one month of treatment. According to the Fibonacci standard 3+3 design, we started from an initial dose of 200 mg/day of NIL, up to a maximum of 600 mg/day. The drug has been supplied free of charge by Novartis Italia, Milan. In the phase II the MTD will be used to define the efficacy of NIL in SR-cGVHD patients, with similar characteristics of the previously Imatinib-treated population. Moreover all the patients enrolled in the phase I were allowed to continue NIL at the same dose, up to a cGVHD progression, if an objective improvement (OI) was documented after 3 months of treatment. We report here the preliminary results of a pre-planned interim analysis, during the phase I study, in 12 patients with SR-cGVHD who received NIL at low dose. The main characteristics of the enrolled patients are reported in table 1. Six patients received NIL 200mg/day and 6 NIL 300 mg/day. Two patients stopped NIL within 30 days: one due to cGVHD progression, the other had asymptomatic hypertransaminasemia (>5xULN) which normalized 1 month after stopping NIL; these patients received an alternative treatment. In 3 cases severe adverse events (SAE) have been reported: 1 patient had extramedullary relapse of Acute Leukemia 8 months after start of NIL, while 2 patients have been hospitalized; one due to a transient cGVHD flare, without drug interruption, the second for a late cGVHD progression; he eventually died. The most frequent extrahematological toxicities (grade 1-2 according to CTCAE) were headache, nausea, pruritus, cramps, asthenia, constipation, while the main hematological abnormalities were represented by anemia grade 1 (5/12patients), neutropenia gr.1 (1/12 patients) and lymphocyte count increase gr.2 (1/12 patients). (tab.2) With a median F-U of 10 months (range 4-20), 10 patients are alive, while two died for cGVHD progression (7 and 9 months after the enrollment). After 3 months of treatment with NIL 6 patients (50%) achieved an OI and 4 (33%) a stable disease; all the 10 patients continued Nilotinib at the same dose until \u22656 months of treatment: after 6 months we observed 5 OI, 1 stable disease and 2 mixed responses (2 lung responses with skin failure), while in 2 the response evaluation is still ongoing. These preliminary data suggest that, like Imatinib, NIL at low doses is safe and effective in SR-cGVHD patients; up to day the MTD has not been still achieved, therefore only after the end of the phase I study we will be able to fully define the NIL activity.
