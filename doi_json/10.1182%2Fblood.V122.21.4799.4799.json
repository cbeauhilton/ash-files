    "abstract_text": "Background Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) refers to the formation of a thrombus within a deep vein that frequently occurs after surgical procedures, trauma, in the presence of cancer and immobilization conditions. DVT is a major health problem that causes high rate of morbidity and mortality in the general population. Hyper coagulation states such as antithrombin-III, protein-C and protein-S deficiencies, contribute to formation of DVT. Congenital and acquired gene mutations are other risk factors that stimulate formation of thrombus. Our aims in this study was to molecularly analyze the patients with DVT and assess the impact of common mutations of MTHFR (C677T) (A1298C), PAI-1, Prothrombin 20210 and FV Leiden mutation on occurrence of deep venous thrombosis. Methods This long-term study was conducted from June 2009 to July 2013 on 221 patients with deep venues thrombosis. Two hundred and twenty-one age and sex matched individuals were also chosen as control group. The diagnosis of venous thromboembolic disease was based on patient\u2019s history, clinical findings and D-dimer test. Finally deep venous thrombosis was confirmed with Doppler ultrasonography. In addition, all participants were asked to complete a standardized questionnaire on acquired risk factors for venous thrombosis. After confirmation of DVT, both groups were assessed molecularly for five mutations including, MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C, PAI-1 4G/5G , Prothrombin 20210 and FV Leiden. The relationship between these mutations and the risk of DVT was calculated using logistic regression and expressed as an OR with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Results The mean age of patients and control group were 38\u00b10.8 and 3.7\u00b1 0.7 years. Our results revealed that the MTHFR C677T (OR 2.9, 95% 95% CI 1.1 to 7.5) and MTHFR A1298C in heterozygote manner (OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.4 to 13.7) were each associated with an increased risk of DVT. The OR associated with being a carrier of the PAI-1 4G/5G genotype was 2.9 (95% CI 1.14 to 7.5). There was a 4-fold increased risk of DVT associated with Prothrombin 20210 mutation in heterozygote manner (OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.4 to 13.7). For patients who were heterozygous for FV Leiden mutation OR DVT was 2.6 (95% CI 1.3 to 5.0). Conclusion Our findings suggest that genetic risk factors have a contributory role on occurrence of DVT.
