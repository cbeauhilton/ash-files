    "abstract_text": "Introduction. The umbilical cord stem cell bank was created in Mexico City in june 2003 due to the need to have access to pluripotential stem cells to cover the hematological and immunological pediatric needs. We have so far 300 units of umbilical stem cells available to the medical community. The bank has been designed with a completely automatic process and the standards are based in NETCORD-FAHCT outlines. Objective. In the present study we made a balance of the evaluation of umbilical cord stem cell process including the maternal setting, the standarization of the methodology to obtain the stem cells, compared to other institutions around the world. Material and methods. Bayesian analysis allow us to evaluate our procedures at the different levels. Bayesian networks are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) where the nodes are random variables and certain independence assumptions hold. Results. In table 1 we show the results of the first 300 units process with the automatic process. The arcs in a bayesian network specify the independence assumptions that must hold between the random variables and the global dependence of the total factors. Figure 1 . Conclusion. Through the bayesian analysis, we found a direct influence of the collected volume, the time between the collection and the procedure, and the maternal unit, with respect to the number of recovered cells, specifically with CD34+ the viable ones as well as the totals.
