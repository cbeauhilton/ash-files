    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3584 The 8;21 translocation, one of the most general chromosomal abnormalities in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), encodes the AML1-ETO chimeric fusion gene. Because AML1-ETO can inhibit the CBF complex to transactivate myeloid-lineage genes in a dominant negative fashion, the high level expression of this gene plays a critical role in inhibiting differentiation of target cells, which leads to progression of AML. We, however, have reported that patients maintaining a long-term remission retain AML1-ETO expression at a very low level that can be detected by nested RT-PCR. The AML1-ETO transcripts in these patients were derived from a small fraction of t(8;21) + hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) capable of multilineage differentiation (PNAS 2000). In fact, previous data shown that AML1/ETO knock-in or AML1/ETO transgenic mice did not develop AML. These data suggest that acquisition of the AML1-ETO fusion is not sufficient to develop t(8;21) AML. Since t(8;21) AML cells frequently possess constitutive active mutation of c-Kit, we hypothesized that the c-Kit mutation may work as a second oncogenic hit in t(8;21) + HSCs to transform into AML. To test the hypothesis, we extensively analyzed the existence of c-Kit mutation within AML1-ETO + HSCs from patients maintaining remission for a long-term. CD34 + CD38 \u2212 HSCs were purified from the bone marrow of patients in long-term remission, and were cultured in vitro to form colonies. These HSC-derived colonies were picked up, and tested for the presence ofAML1-ETO and c-Kit mutation. Five t(8;21) AML patients with c-Kit mutation were enrolled in this study. All of 1020 blastic colonies at diagnosis were positive for both AML1-ETO and c-Kit mutation. In 7187 colonies formed in the culture of remission marrow, almost 1% (89 colonies) of these colonies expressed AML1-ETO. Surprisingly, none of these colonies possessed c-Kit mutation, indicating that AML1-ETO + clones in remission are not identical to these in t(8;21) AML. Accordingly, it is highly likely that HSCs first acquire AML1-ETO, and a fraction of these cells additionally mutated c-Kit, resulting in transformation into AML stem cells. This is the first clear-cut evidence that human HSCs transform into AML via multi-step oncogenesis in vivo . Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
