    "abstract_text": "Current protocols for HSC gene therapy, involving the transplantation of ex vivo lentivirus vector-transduced HSCs into myeloablated recipients, are complex and not without risk for the patient. We have developed a new approach for in vivo gene delivery into HSCs that does not require myeloablation and HSC transplantation. It involves injections of G-CSF/AMD3100 to mobilize HSCs from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood stream and the intravenous injection of an integrating, helper-dependent adenovirus (HDAd5/35++) vector system. Transgene integration is achieved (in a random pattern) using a hyperactive Sleeping Beauty transposase (SB100x). We demonstrated in adequate mouse models, using GFP as a transgene, that primitive HSCs transduced in the periphery home back to the bone marrow where they persist and stably express GFP long-term (Blood 128:2206 (2016). To achieve high level transgene marking in differentiated peripheral blood cells, we combined our in vivo HSC transduction approach with in vivo selection of transduced HSCs using the mgtmP140K mutant and low dose O6BG/BCNU treatment. Here were tested the potential of this approach for the therapy of hemoglobinopathies. Our HDAd5/35++ vector contained the human-gamma globin gene under the control of a 6kb version of the beta-globin LCR (containing HS1 to HS4 and the beta globin promoter) and the mgmtP140K gene under the control of the PGK promoter. Mobilized immunocompetent hCD46 transgenic mice were injected IV with the integrating vector system and subjected to three rounds of treatment with low-dose O6BG/BCNU followed by immunosuppression to avoid immune responses against the human transgene product. The procedure was safe and resulted in stable human gamma globin expression in >95% of erythrocytes in the peripheral blood of in vivo transduced cells mice. Human gamma globin levels were 100% of endogenous mouse beta globin levels in erythrocytes measured by HPLC. Analysis of bone marrow at week 16 after in vivo transduction showed that >60% of bone marrow LSK cells contained the integrated transgene cassette and that the beta globin LCR efficiently restricted gamma globin expression to erythroid cells. After transplantation of unsorted, lineage-depleted bone marrow cells into lethally irradiated recipients, long-term gamma-globin expression at levels seen in the primary in vivo treated mice was demonstrated. The efficacy of our approach achieved in this study indicates that it would be curative in thalassemia models or patients. Our new approach avoids the collection of HSCs, their transduction ex vivo, and subsequent transplantation into myeloablated recipients. It therefore could greatly simplify HSC gene therapy of common diseases. Disclosures Kiem: Rocket Pharmaceuticals: Consultancy, Equity Ownership, Patents & Royalties, Research Funding.",
