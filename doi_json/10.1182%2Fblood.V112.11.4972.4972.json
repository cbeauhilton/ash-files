    "abstract_text": "Objective: To investigate the technique of labelling 131 I-Rituximab and establish an easy, fast and effective method for iodine-labelled antibodies. To detect the stability and immunoactivity of the labelled compound. To study the biological response of B-cell lymphoma cells to 131 I-Rituximab. To observe the tissue distribution and the therapeutic effect of 131 I-Rituximab in lymphoma tumor borne in nude mice, in order to offer the experimenta ecidence for the next radioimmunotherapy. Methods: Rituximab was labelled with 131 I by means of Iodogen method. Detecting the labelling efficiency, radiochemical purity and immunoreactive fraction of 131 I-Rituximab at different reaction time. Measuring the changes of radiochemical purity of 131 I-Rituximab at different storage conditions(stores at 4\u00b0C). Study the biological character of Raji cells by measuring the cytoactivity by Type Blue, the expression of surface antigens by flow cytometry(FCM), The cells were randomized into four groups that were 131 I-Rituximab group ARituximab alone A 131 I alone Ablank group, and its effects on apoptosis and cell cycles of Raji cells were determined by cytometry. Raji cell was inoculated subcutaneously in 35 nude mice. Observe the tissue distribution and the therapeutic effect of 131 I-Rituximab in lymphoma tumor borne in nude mice. Nude mice were randomized into six groups while the tumor was 8 mm in diameter. The groups were: high,middle,low dose radioimmunotherapy groups,Rituximab alone, 131 I alone Ablank group. The size of the tumor was measured per three days and the mice were killed in four weeks after treatment. The tumors were resected and weighed. Results: 1.The labelling efficiency of 131 I and Rituximab at 4 minutes reaction time was 90.0%, and the radiochemical purity was 99.4%, the immunoreacive fraction of 131 I- Rituximab was 35.6%. The compound was satble,after 24h, the radiochemical purity was 91.0%. 2.The Raji cells had more than 90% of cytoactivity and 98.03% of surface expression of CD20. The apoptosis rate measured by Annexin V-FITC/PI was higher than that in other groups. Cell cycle alteration occurred in 131 I-Rituximab group, and the majority of cells were arrested at G 2 stage. 3.The tissue distribution indicate that 131 I-Rituximab was mainly detected in the tumor. As compared to blank group, therapy groups\u2019 tumor growth was inhibited and the inhibition was does and time dependent. The pathological results show that the therapy is effective. Conclusion: The labelling method-Iodogen method proved to be effective as the labeling rate was high, the compound was stable, immunoreactive to Raji cells. According to our research, the optimal reaction time for labelling Rituximab with Na 131 I is 4 minutes. the labelling efficiency(90.0%), radiochemical purity(98.4%) and immunoactivity were all high very much, and can be obtained for intraurmor injection at animal tests. 131 I-Rituximab can regulate the cycle of Raji cells and induce their apoptosis to inhibit their proliferation. The results indicate that the radioimmunological drug made from anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and 131 I can specifically localise in tumor tissue and ensure radioimmunological targeting therapy, so it has underlying clinical value.",
