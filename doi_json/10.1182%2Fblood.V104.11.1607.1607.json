    "abstract_text": "Erythroid and megakaryocytic cells are derived from a common precursor and share many of the same transcriptional regulators. We and others have demonstrated a critical role for sustained activation of extracellular-related (ERK) kinase in PKC-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells. However, the transcriptional mechanisms underlying this process are largely unknown. Our prior studies have focused on late stage megakaryocyte specific genes such as glycoprotein IIb/CD41. In order to understand the early transcriptional events regulating this process, we have begun to examine the mechanisms regulating the expression of CD9, a tetraspanin molecule that is currently the earliest identified marker of megakaryocyte differentiation. The PKC agonist ingenol 3,20 dibenzoate (IDB) rapidly induced CD9 expression in both K562 cells as well as in primary human CD34+ progenitor cells, much earlier than the kinetics for CD41 induction. CD9 induction by PKC was dependent on ERK activation. Recently, it has been shown that immediate early gene expression, including the transcription factor Egr-1, is highly sensitive to the duration and amplitude of ERK activity. Egr-1 has been previously implicated in the regulation of hematopoietic lineage commitment. PKC/ERK activation rapidly and strongly induced Egr-1 expression, which remained elevated for up to 96 hrs after IDB treatment of K562 cells. Egr-1 induction was closely followed by CD9 induction, suggesting a causal relationship. This was supported by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, which showed strong recruitment of Egr-1 to the CD9 promoter during PKC/ERK-induced differentiation. KLF5, a known downstream target of Egr-1, was identified as an additional target of PKC/ERK signaling during megakaryocytic differentiation. KLF5, a novel GC binding factor, was found to be expressed in primary megakaryocytes and not in erythroid cells. KLF5 expression was induced by IDB treatment, and ChIP analysis showed that Egr-1 was recruited to the KLF5 promoter during PKC/ERK-induced differentiation. KLF5 has been shown previously to regulate known megakaryocyte-expressed genes PDGF-A and TGF-\u03b2 expression in vascular smooth muscle, but a role in megakaryocyte gene expression has not been previously suggested. To better understand the regulation of Egr-1 in erythromegakaryocytic differentiation, Nab2, a natural co-repressor of Egr-1 was also evaluated. Control K562 cells strongly expressed c-myc and Nab2. ChIP studies show that c-myc binds to the Nab2 promoter in control K562 cells and both c-myc and Nab2 expression strongly declined during the first 24 hours after PKC stimulation. Enforced expression of Nab2 not only blocked CD9 induction by IDB, but also induced marked hemoglobinization of K562 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest a novel and critical role for the balance in Egr-1/Nab2 activity as a regulatory mechanism in erythroid versus megakaryocytic differentiation pathways.",
