    "abstract_text": "Introduction Clofarabine (Clo) is a purine analogue which was developed to overcome limitations and to incorporate the favorable pharmakokinetic properties of fludarabine and cladribine. This agent has also a significant antileukemic activity. Thus, can one exploit both the antileukemic and immunosuppressive effects of Clo for further improving outcome after RIC allo-SCT for patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute leukemia. Here we report the results of a prospective multicentre trial testing the use of Clo in replacement of fludarabine in combination with i.v. Busulfan (Bu) and ATG in 30 patients with high-risk MDS/acute leukemia (clinicaltrials no. NCT00863148). Patients and Methods Thirty patients (male n=18, female n=12) from 6 centres were included in this study between October 2009 and August 2012. Sixteen patients were diagnosed with high-risk MDS (n=5) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n=11), while 13 patients had high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, Ph+ n= 2, Ph- n=11) and 1 patient a biphenotypic leukemia. All patients were in first (AML/MDS, n= 10; ALL/biphenotypic n=10) or second (AML n= 3; ALL n= 4) complete remission, or in stable disease (MDS n=3) at time of transplant. Median age at transplant was 58.8 years (range: 20.5-64.5). The median interval between diagnosis and transplant was 6 months (range: 3.8-124). Karnofsky\u2019s performans status at transplant was: 100% (n=19); 90% (n=6); and 80% (n=4).The RIC regimen consisted of: i.v. Clo 30 mg/m\u00b2/day for 4 days (day-8 to day-5), i.v. Bu 3.2 mg/Kg/day for 2 days (day-4 and day-3) and ATG (Thymoglobuline) 2.5 mg/kg/day for 2 days (day -2 and day-1). All patients received G-CSF-mobilized PBSCs and cyclosporine alone for GVHD prophylaxis, irrespective of the type of donor (sibling donors n=14; 10/10 MUD, n=16). For the purpose of this study, the single case of binephotypic leukemia was considered as ALL for comparison between AML/MDS and ALL patients. The primary endpoint of the trial was the assessment of leukemia-free survival (LFS) at one year after allo-SCT. Results Engraftment was observed in all patients (100%). Median time for neutrophils (>500 /\u00b5L) and platelets (>50.000/\u00b5L) recovery was 18 (range: 14-26) and 12 (range: 0-23) days, respectively. With a median follow-up of 23 months (range: 12-37), the 1-year and 2-year overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survivals (LFS), relapse incidence (RI) and non relapse mortality (NRM) rates were 63\u00b19% and 58+-10%, 57\u00b19% and 53+-9%, 40\u00b19% and 44+-9%, and 3.3\u00b13% and 3.3\u00b13%, respectively. Thirteen patients relapsed (43%) at a median time of 3.5 months (range: 2.3-13.1) after allo-SCT. Overall, 13 patients died, with the cause of death being relapse in 11 and GVHD in 2 (including one after donor lymphocyte injection). 1-year and 2-year OS were significantly higher for AML/MDS patients compared to ALL patients (75\u00b110% vs 50\u00b113%, and 75\u00b110% vs 37\u00b114%, p=0.04). There were trends for higher 1-year and 2-year LFS (69\u00b112% vs 43\u00b113%, and 69\u00b112% vs 34\u00b113%, p=0.08) and lower RI (57\u00b114% vs 25\u00b111%, and 66\u00b114% vs 25\u00b111%, p=0.05) for AML/MDS patients compared to ALL patients. Finally, 1-year and 2-year NRM were similar between both groups (AML/MDS: 6\u00b16% vs 0%, p=0.36). Conclusion This phase 2 prospective multicentre trial shows that a Clo-i.v. Bu-ATG RIC regimen prior to allo-SCT in high-risk MDS/leukemia is feasible allowing for full engraftment and very low toxicity. Disease control appears to be satisfactorily, especially in AML/MDS, warranting a prospective comparison with other widely used fludarabine-based RIC regimens (e.g. Fludarabine, i.v. Bu, ATG versus Clo, i.v. Bu, ATG). Genzyme/Sanofi provided clofarabine and financial support for the study. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
