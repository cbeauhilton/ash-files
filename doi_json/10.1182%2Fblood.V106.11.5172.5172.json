    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Several treatment programs are available for the initial management of patients with multiple myeloma, with no clear documented advantage(s) of one regimen over the others in terms of time to progression (TTP) or overall survival (OS). Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was mailed to 540 randomly selected members of ASH during early 2005. Practitioners were asked their choice of therapy for newly diagnosed myeloma patients during 2004, based on 2005 NCCN guidelines, including: 1) melphalan/prednisone (MP), 2) vincristine / adriamycin / decadron (VAD), 3) high-dose decadron (HD), 4) thalidomide / decadron (Thal/Dex), 5) doxyl / vincristine / decadron (DVD); the options of a clinical trial (CT) or \u201cother\u201d were also included. Physicians were asked about factors influencing their choice of therapy for individual patients and their recommendations for autologous stem cell transplantation as part of the initial treatment schema. Results: Surveys were returned by 123 physicians(19.2%), of which 93 contained evaluable data. Among responders, 52% were in private practice and 47% in academic institutions and 74% respondants reporting having been in practice for more than 10 years. A large majority of physicians (74%) utilized 3 or more different regimens, only 10.7% of responders used a single regimen for all of their patients. Thal/Dex was used by 87% of responders, with 47% of them recommending this regimen in \u2265 50% of their patients. MP, HD and VAD were used by 67.7%, 49% and 44% of responders, but only 10.7%, 4% and 3% respectively, recommended them to \u2265 50% of their patients. DVD was used by 25% of physicians. Of respondants, 64.5% did not accrued patients to clinical trials and only 7.5% of physicians accrued \u2265 50% of their patients to clinical trials. No significant differences in the choice of regimen were apparent based on years of practice. Physicians in academic centers tended to use HD (p =.002) and accrue patients to CT (p=. 001) more often than those in private practice. Factors identified as important in selecting initial therapy for individual patients included: age (92%); performance status (95%); prognostic factors, such as \u03b22-microglobulin and cytogenetics (75%); and candidacy for stem cell transplantation (93%). Respondants consider autologous stem cell transplantation as part of the initial therapy for all eligible patients (47%), only those with responsive disease (42%) and normal renal function (30%); only in selected cases (76%). Conclusions: Thal/Dex appears to be currently the most commonly recommended up-front therapy for multiple myeloma in the USA, in spite of the lack of published data documenting patient benefit in terms of TTP and OS. A sizable proportion of physicians do not recommend autologous stem cell transplantation as part of the initial therapy of newly diagnosed myeloma patients despite confirmed randomized clinical trials documenting benefit.",
