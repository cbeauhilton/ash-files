    "abstract_text": "Background: Clonal cytogenetic aberrations define multiple myeloma (MM) into unique subsets of the disease each one with unique clinical and biologic features, associations with laboratory and pathologic markers and presumed differential influence on disease progression. While it is widely accepted that translocations represent primordial events in the pathogenesis of MM, it is controversial whether all translocations can be associated with disease stability and non-malignant behavior (i.e. in MGUS/SMM). We have found the translocations in cases of MGUS using dual fusion, cIg enhanced, interphase FISH, while others have found this translocation at lower prevalence using single fusion interphase FISH or the RT-PCR for IgH/MMSET. We thus sought to clarify by expanding the study of the t(4;14) among patients with MGUS and SMM. Materials and methods: We studied 210 patients who had the diagnosis of MGUS and SMM and entered into the Mayo Clinic Dysproteinemia database. Patients were excluded if they had active MM, extramedullary disease or plasmacytoma. Patients with isolated lytic bone lesions could be included if they had no overt evidence of progression. All studied patients had provided written informed consent for the collection of a research bone marrow aliquot that was collected at the time of routine bone marrow procurement. All patients had cytospin slides that were studied for a t(4;14) using cIg-FISH as previously described by us and using a double fusion FISH strategy. The importance of this is that the strategy will detect unbalanced t(4;14) with loss of der(14). Results: Twenty patients (9.5%) had evidence of the chromosome translocation. Detailed demographic data was available in 19; 14 were women (74%), 13 of 19 (68%) had SMM and there was no bias for heavy chain IgA (26%). Patients with t(4;14) were slightly younger than those without the abnormality (52 vs. 61 years), had similar hemoglobin concentrations, had slightly higher concentration of the serum M spike (2.0 vs 1.75 g/dl) and had overall slightly higher bone marrow plasmacytosis (median 23% vs 10%). Patients were followed since diagnosis for a median of 33 months (range 2\u2013162 months). Three patients progressed to active MM at 12, 12 and 26 months after original diagnosis (all three originally having indolent/SMM). Conclusion: The t(4;14) can occur in patients with MGUS and SMM and without evidence of progression to MM. The prevalence is similar to that observed in MM, albeit slightly lower (9.5% versus 14%). In most \u201cbenign\u201d plasma cell neoplasms the translocation is associated with greater plasmacytosis and thus enriched for in the smoldering MM category. It is also likely that the t(4;14) confers a higher risk of progression to MM given; a) its enrichment in SMM, b) the slightly higher prevalence of the translocation in MM as opposed to MGUS/SMM, and c) the well documented aggressive clinical course of MM with t(4;14).",
