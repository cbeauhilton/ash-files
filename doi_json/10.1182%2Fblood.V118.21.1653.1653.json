    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1653 Introduction: A significant proportion of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients refractory to first-line chemotherapy or relapsing after autologous transplantation are not cured with currently available treatments and require new treatments. The PI3K/AKT and RAF/MEK/ERK pathways are constitutively activated in the majority of HL. These pathways can be targeted using the AKT inhibitor perifosine (\u00c6terna Zentaris GmBH, Germany, EU), and the RAF/MEK/ERK inhibitor sorafenib (Nexavar\u00ae, Bayer, Germany, EU). We hypothesized that perifosine in combination with sorafenib might have a therapeutic activity in HL by overcoming the cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic effects of PI3K/Akt and RAF/MEK/ERK pathways. Since preclinical evidence supporting the anti-lymphoma effects of the perifosine/sorafenib combination are still lacking, the present study aimed at investigating in vitro and in vivo the activity and mechanism(s) of action of this two-drug combination. METHODS: Three HL cell lines (HD-MyZ, L-540 and HDLM-2) were used to investigate the effects of perifosine and sorafenib using in vitro assays analyzing cell growth, cell cycle distribution, gene expression profiling (GEP), and apoptosis. Western blotting (WB) experiments were performed to determine whether the two-drug combination affected MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways as well as apoptosis. Additionally, the antitumor efficacy and mechanism of action of perifosine/sorafenib combination were investigated in vivo in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immune-deficient (NOD/SCID) mice. RESULTS: While perifosine and sorafenib as single agents exerted a limited activity against HL cells, exposure of HD-MyZ and L-540 cell lines, but not HDLM-2 cells, to perifosine/sorafenib combination resulted in synergistic cell growth inhibition (40% to 80%) and cell cycle arrest. Upon perifosine/sorafenib exposure, L-540 cell line showed significant levels of apoptosis (up to 70%, P \u2264.0001) associated with severe mitochondrial dysfunction (cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor release and marked conformational change of Bax accompanied by membrane translocation). Apoptosis induced by perifosine/sorafenib combination did not result in processing of caspase-8, -9, -3, or cleavage of PARP, and was not reversed by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VADfmk, supporting a caspase-independent mechanism of apoptosis. In responsive cell lines, WB analysis showed that anti-proliferative events were associated with dephosphorylation of MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. GEP analysis of HD-MyZ and L-540 cell lines, but not HDLM-2 cells indicated that perifosine/sorafenib treatment induced upregulation of genes involved in amino acid metabolism and downregulation of genes regulating cell cycle, DNA replication and cell death. In addition, in responsive cell lines, perifosine/sorafenib combination strikingly induced the expression of tribbles homologues 3 (TRIB3) both in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of TRIB3 prevented cell growth reduction induced by perifosine/sorafenib treatment. In vivo, the combined perifosine/sorafenib treatment significantly increased the median survival of NOD/SCID mice xenografted with HD-MyZ cell line as compared to controls (81 vs 45 days, P \u2264.0001) as well as mice receiving perifosine alone (49 days, P \u2264.03) or sorafenib alone (54 days, P \u2264.007). In mice bearing subcutaneous nodules generated by HD-MyZ and L-540 cell lines but not HDLM-2 cell line, perifosine/sorafenib treatment induced significantly increased levels of apoptosis (2- to 2.5-fold, P \u2264.0001) and necrosis (2- to 8-fold, P \u2264.0001), as compared to controls or treatment with single agents. CONCLUSIONS: Perifosine/sorafenib combination resulted in potent anti-HL activity both in vitro and in vivo. These results warrant clinical evaluation in HL patients.
