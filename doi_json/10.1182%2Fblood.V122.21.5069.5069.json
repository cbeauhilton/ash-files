    "abstract_text": "Objective To explore the expression and prognosis of STAT3 in Chinese patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Methods The expression of STAT3 was examined by the immunohistochemistry (IHC) method.120 patients with de novo DLBCL were reviewed retrospectively. Results Among the 120 patients, the ratio of male to female was 1.26:1, 47.5% of them were Non-GCB and 52.5% were GCB-DLBCL. The expression of STAT3 was observed in 50 of 120 cases (41.7%) and more frequent in the non-germinal center B cell-like (Non-GCB) DLBCL than that in the GCB subtype. The prognosis analysis showed that age, B symptom, bone marrow involvement, number of extranodal involvement, LDH, cell of origin and IPI related with prognosis, but not the expression of STAT3. However, in patients with advanced diffuse large B cell lymphoma, the expression of STAT3 was a poor prognostic factor. Conclusion STAT3 is expressed predominantly in Non-GCB DLBCL. The expression of STAT3 correlates poor outcome in patients with advanced diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
