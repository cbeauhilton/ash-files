    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs) represents a disorder that involves abnormal proliferation of cells originating from the myeloid line. The proliferation of these cells can lead to complications that are at times fatal. Despite its potential to cause life threatening complications, there is little data on this disease in Southeast Asia. As Singapore is a multiracial country in Southeast Asia, there may be some disease characteristics exclusive to patients here due to its unique population composition. The data from this Southeast Asian cohort would be useful to determine disease homogeneity in Asian countries. Methods: A retrospective review of the MPN database from National University Hospital, Singapore (NUHS) revealed 320 patients who were clinically diagnosed with MPN from 2008 to 2017. This data included patients with Essential Thrombocythemia (ET), Polycythemia Rubra Vera (PRV), Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF), Myeloproliferative Neoplasm, unclassifiable (MPN-U) and Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia (CEL) (Figure 1A) as per the 2017 WHO classification. For this analysis, we included only the classical Philadelphia chromosome negative MPN and focused on the epidemiology, transformation and overall survival rate. Results: There was a slight male predominance with a male to female ratio of 1.3:1. The ethnic groups within this cohort consisted of 65.8% ethnic Chinese, 20.7% Malay, 5.5% Indian and the rest were made up of other ethnic groups within the region such as Eurasians, Thai, Filipinos, Burmese, Indonesians, Bangladeshi, Vietnamese and Arabian patients. The mean age at diagnosis for this group was 60.5. The mean age was 59.2 years for ET, 61.2 for PRV and the mean age of PMF was the oldest at 63.8. The mean age of diagnosis for ET and PMF patients in our cohort was slightly older compared to the Korean cohort (55.4 and 59.5 years) (Byun, et al., 2016). The majority of this cohort was made up of ET patients (53.1%) followed by PRV (35.3%) and PMF (11.6%). 77.5% of these patients were JAK2 V617F mutation (JAK2) positive. The percentage of patients who were JAK2 positive for ET, PRV and PMF were 69.2%, 96.9% and 56.3% respectively. The percentage of JAK2 positive patients for the three subtypes were higher in our local population compared to the Chinese and Japanese cohorts. Only 120 patients were tested for Calreticulin Exon 9 (CALR) mutations as this molecular test was only available in our institution from 2015 onwards. ET patients make up 68.4% of CALR positive patients. It was noted that CALR positive patients had comparatively higher mean platelet counts of 925.2 than CALR negative patients with mean platelet counts of 691.7. This phenomenon is seen in both CALR positive ET and CALR positive MF patients. In the 10-year period, 25 patients were lost to follow up and 8 patients transferred their care to another institution. Overall, 27 patients were deceased, with a mean survival of 3.5 years. The death-to-case ratio was 11.5 per 100 cases. The death-to-case ratio for ET, PRV and PMF is 6.1 per 100, 8.2 per 100 and 31.3 per 100 respectively. During this period, only 6 patients had transformation. Three patients progressed to post-ET myelofibrosis and 3 had leukemic transformation. Those who had leukemic transformation were initially diagnosed with PRV (1 patient) and PMF (2 patients). All patients who had leukemic transformation were deceased and had a mean survival of 1.4 years from the transformation event. Conclusion: Whilst there were some observable differences between our data and existing Asian data, there is still insufficient information to determine disease homogeneity. This is partly due to the rapid growth of molecular knowledge in this field and the regular revision of the WHO diagnostic criteria of MPNs over the last decade or so. There needs to be coordinated efforts within the region to ensure that our patients have equal access to these diagnostic platforms and that they receive an accurate diagnosis.
