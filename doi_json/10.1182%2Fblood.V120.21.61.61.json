    "abstract_text": "Abstract 61 The loss of response to apoptotic stimulus in lymphoma is a major obstacle in the treatment of primary and refractory B-cell malignancies. While the role of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in the pathogenesis, maintenance, and progression of many sub-types of B-cell lymphoma is well characterized, the impact of the expression level(s) of other key regulatory proteins of cell death pathways (i.e. inhibitor of apoptosis [IAP] proteins) is less defined. The role of IAP proteins in the acquirement of resistance to rituximab or chemotherapy in B-cell lymphoma is unclear. Overexpression of IAP proteins and loss of expression of its antagonist, the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) correlates with inferior clinical outcomes in a range of malignancies. Perhaps related to the acquisition of resistance, we found that rituximab-resistant cell lines (RRCL) have a deregulation of pro-apoptotic (Bak/Bax) and anti-apoptotic (Mcl-1, Bcl-XL) Bcl-2 family protein expression along with increased expression of the IAP protein survivin. Small molecule SMAC mimetics like LCL-161 are promising agents for lowering the threshold of tumor cell apoptosis, and represent a potential new avenue of therapy for de novo and refractory drug-resistant lymphoma. To this end, we evaluated the anti-tumor activity of LCL-161 in a range of rituximab-sensitive (RSCL), RRCL, and primary lymphoma cells. Cells were exposed to escalating doses of LCL-161 alone or in combination with various chemotherapy agents (i.e. etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, gemcitabine, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, bortezomib and cytarabine) for 48 and 72 hrs. Changes in cell viability and ATP content were determined by the CellTiter-Glo viability assay. Protein lysates were obtained from RSCL and RRCL to determine baseline levels of IAP protein family members. LCL-161 displayed significant anti-tumor activity against Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), diffuse large B-cell (DLBCL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines. Activity was observed in both RSCL and RRCL cell lines. IC 50 values for LCL-161 alone were between 35uM and 45uM for the DLBCL lines. Responses were slightly lower in BL and MCL compared to DLBCL cell lines. Synergistic activity between LCL-161 and several chemotherapy agents (e.g. gemcitabine, cytarabine, carboplatin, vincristine, etoposide and bortezomib) commonly used in the management of aggressive lymphoma was seen at physiologically-relevant doses. In vitro exposure of lymphoma cells to LCL-161 decreased the cytotoxic threshold of chemotherapy by 50%, while ex vivo studies with primary patient lymphoma samples showed a decrease of nearly 60%. In vivo studies using a xenograft SCID murine model are planned. In summary, LCL-161 has shown activity both as a single agent, and when combined with several chemotherapy agents in BL, MCL, and DLBCL cell lines as well as primary patient samples. Additionally, LCL-161 exhibits significant cytotoxic activity against RRCLs suggesting an ability to antagonize IAP proteins. This data supports the continued investigation of LCL-161 as a novel and effective targeted agent for the treatment of de novo and refractory aggressive B-cell lymphomas.
