    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3259 Integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 undergoes allosteric conformational changes in its extracellular domains, resulting in integrin activation that allows high affinity binding with soluble ligands. The crystal structure of the integrin \u03b2 subunit revealed an interaction of the \u03b2-tail domain (\u03b2TD) with the \u03b2I domain containing ligand-binding sites, suggesting that \u03b2TD may be involved in allosteric mechanism for integrin activation. However, previous studies have shown conflicting results on the functional role of \u03b2TD in integrin activation. In this study, we conducted site-directed mutagenesis in the \u03b2TD domain and tested ligand binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 mutants. We produced \u03b1IIb\u03b23 mutants in which the \u03b23TD loop residues (DSSG) were substituted with the corresponding \u03b21 (NGNN) or \u03b22TD residues (DGMD). The \u03b1IIb\u03b23 mutants were expressed on the surface of CHO cells by cotransfection of mutant \u03b23 and wild-type \u03b1IIb cDNAs, and were tested for binding of PAC1, a ligand-mimetic anti-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 antibody. The NGNN, but not DGMD mutant bound significant PAC1 binding without any stimulation, indicating a constitutively active state. To identify the residue(s) responsible for \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation in the \u03b2TD, we produced \u03b1IIb\u03b23 mutants in which the individual residues in the \u03b23TD loop were substituted with the corresponding \u03b21TD residues. Among them, only G675N bound significant PAC1 binding without any stimulation. Since G675N mutation creates a sequence known to be a consensus sequence for glycosylation (Asn-X-Ser/Thr), it is possible that the insertion of glycans into the \u03b2TD loop induces conformational changes in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 which allow ligand binding. To test this hypothesis, we added substitution of S677 with Thr, Ala or Asp to the G675N mutation. The resultant G675N/S677T double mutant, in which the N-glycosylation site was preserved, was constitutively active. In contrast, G675N/S677A and G675N/S677D, in which the N-glycosylation site was disrupted, were in an inactive state. These results suggest that an artificial glycan wedge between \u03b2TD and \u03b2I domains activates \u03b1IIb\u03b23. However, our study does not provide evidence that the \u03b2TD domain constrains wild type \u03b1IIb\u03b23 inactive although the separation of \u03b2TD and \u03b2I domains may be able to activate integrins.
