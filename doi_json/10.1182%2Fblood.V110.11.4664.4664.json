    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Janus kinase 2 gene (JAK2) encodes for a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase involved in normal hematopoietic growth factor signaling. Point mutations of the JAK2 gene on chromosome 9, specifically V617F, a point mutation at amino acid 617, are associated with myeloproliferative disorders (MPD). The V617F JAK2 mutation has been found in 90% of patients with polycythemia vera, 50\u201360% of patients with essential thrombocythemia or idiopathic myelofibrosis and 1\u20135% of patients with other MPD. To our knowledge, previous studies involving the V617F JAK2 mutation were not performed on a control population of normal individuals. Therefore, the prevalence of this mutation has not been established. In this study, we tested volunteer blood donors from a hospital-based blood donation center for the presence of the V617F JAK2 mutation. METHODS: Citrated whole blood was obtained from volunteer blood donors, age 17 and older, who presented to donate whole blood at a hospital-based blood donation center. The donors met all qualifications to donate blood as defined by FDA regulations. DNA was extracted using the QIAagen and QIAamp DNA extraction columns, quantified and diluted to 100ng/ul. DNA was simultaneously amplified and detected using allele specific minor groove binder probes and primers for the V617F JAK2 mutation. The resultant amplification was recorded by real-time, quantitative PCR using an ABI 7500 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A 1% limit of detection, determined from sensitivity and specificity studies using a known cell line control, was set as the technically reproducible threshold sensitivity of the test. Samples were defined as negative for the V617F JAK2 mutation if only the wild type allele was detected. Samples that had a mutant allele detected above the 1% limit of detection were defined as positive for the V617F JAK2 mutation. Samples that had a mutant allele detected below the 1% limit of detection were defined as negative for the V617F JAK2 mutation. RESULTS: A total of 181 DNA samples from volunteer blood donors were tested for the V617F JAK2 mutation. The test group consisted of 104 males (mean age 44, range 17\u201377) and 77 females (mean age 42, range 18\u201371). Of the 181 donors tested, 171 had only wild type allele detected and were considered negative. Ten donors had high background of the mutant allele detected below the 1% limit of detection and were considered negative. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report documenting the prevalence of the V617F JAK2 mutation in a healthy blood donor population. In this study of 181 volunteer blood donors none had the V617F JAK2 mutation. Although 10 of the 181 donors were found to have mutant allele detected, they were below the 1% technically reproducible sensitivity threshold of the test and were considered negative. We recommend that mutations detected below the technical threshold of 1% of our assay be considered false positives. The results of this study suggest that the V617F JAK2 mutation is not present in a healthy blood donor population and is significant when detected by our method."
