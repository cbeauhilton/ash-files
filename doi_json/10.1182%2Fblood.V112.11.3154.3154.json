    "abstract_text": "The tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in growth, metastasis, and survival of tumors. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells of many patients can rapidly undergo apoptosis in vitro unless co-cultured with accessory cells, which elaborate factors that promote CLL-cell survival. A major type of such accessory cells is nurse-like cells (NLC), which prior studies demonstrated could differentiate from CD14 + blood mononuclear cells when exposed to CLL B cells in vitro , and presumably in vivo . In the absence of CLL cells, blood mononuclear CD14+ cells typically differentiate into macrophages that have a distinctive morphology from that of NLC. We found that, compared with macrophages, NLCs consistently expressed significantly higher levels of B-cell activating factor (BAFF) (n=11), a tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-related ligand that promotes survival of B cells, including CLL B cells. To investigate the influence of CLL cells on the differentiation of NLC in vitro , purified CLL B cells or B cells of healthy donors were cultured for 24h to generate conditioned media. When CD14 + blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors were cultured for 7 days in media conditioned by CLL cells, but not in non-conditioned media or in media conditioned by normal B cells, the cells assumed the morphology of NLC, acquired high-level expression of BAFF, and developed an enhanced capacity to support CLL cell survival in vitro . Similar activity was also found in the sera of CLL patients, but not in the sera of healthy control donors. The capacity of either CLL-conditioned media (n=4) or CLL-patient sera (n=9) to induce NLC differentiation leading to increased expression of BAFF was significantly reduced by a decoy receptor for TNF-a, suggesting that TNF-a contributes to the differentiation of NLC in vitro . However, TNF-a alone was not sufficient to induce high-level expression of BAFF on blood mononuclear CD14+ cells, suggesting that additional factors are involved. The results show a previously unrecognized symbiosis between CLL cells and accessory cells in their microenvironment. Because the survival of neoplastic B cells in vivo potentially depends upon NLC found in the lymphoid tissues of patients with CLL, identification of the factor(s) involved in inducing their differentiation could provide a novel target for therapy of patients with this disease."
