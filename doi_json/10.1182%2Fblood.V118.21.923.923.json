    "abstract_text": "Abstract 923 AML1-ETO (AE), the product of translocation 8;21, is the most frequently observed fusion gene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although AE is not sufficient to induce leukemia by itself, it endows a significant survival and growth advantage to hematopoietic progenitors. In a search of various AML microarray databases, we found that the Leukemia-Associated Rho Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (LARG) gene expression is consistently upregulated in samples from AE-positive AML patients compared to other types of AML. This observation was confirmed in an independent cohort of AML samples by qPCR and Western Blot analysis, and in a pre-leukemia cell model generated by AE expression in CD34+ human cord blood (CB) cells compared with CB cells transduced with the MLL-AF9 (MA9) fusion gene or control retroviral vector. ChIP-PCR assays further indicate that AE directly binds to the LARG regulatory region through cis-elements containing AML1 (Runx1) binding sites. LARG, a RhoA GEF, can activate the RhoA pathway which is important for interaction between cells and their environment. We found that the AE cell lines were more adhesive to fibronectin than the MA9 cell lines. When we used lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA to suppress LARG expression in AE+ pre-leukemic cells, the cells showed a significant decrease in adhesion to fibronectin. In addition, knockdown of LARG also significantly interfered with the growth of AE cells in that the shRNA transduced cells displayed a competitive disadvantage relative to non-transduced or control-transduced cells in a proliferation assay. Cell cycle analysis revealed that LARG knockdown induced cell cycle exit, while Annexin V staining showed that LARG suppression promoted apoptosis of AE cells. Because LARG is a well-known guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RhoA GTPase, we examined the downstream signaling events of the LARG/Rho axis, including phosphorylation of MLC and AURORA, targets of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK). pMLC and pAURORA were significantly down-regulated upon knockdown of LARG. Phosphorylation of Stat3, another protein downstream of RhoA signaling important for the proliferation and survival of myeloid cells, was also decreased upon LARG knockdown. These findings suggest that LARG is a transcriptional target of the AML1-ETO fusion protein and the LARG-RhoA signaling pathway plays an essential role in the proliferation and survival of AE cells. The LARG/RhoA pathway may serve as a new therapeutic target in t(8;21) AML. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
