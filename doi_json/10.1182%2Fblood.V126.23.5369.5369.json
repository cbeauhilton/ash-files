    "abstract_text": "Background: Almost all patients with multiple myeloma will eventually become relapsed/refractory (RRMM). Current treatments for RRMM are mainly targeted therapies, composed of dual and triple agents including proteasome inhibitors (PIs) with dexamethasone and/or immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). Panobinostat, a treatment with a novel mechanism of action by inhibiting histone deacetylase, has been recently approved to be used in combination with bortezomib (a PI) and dexamethasone for the treatment of RRMM patients who have received least 2 prior regimens including bortezomib and an IMiD. Objective: To estimate cost per treated patient and cost per month free of progression or death for different targeted therapies among RRMM patients with at least 2 prior regimens. Methods: FVD, K, KRD, PD, RVD, RD and VD were evaluated. D, F, K, P, R, V referred to dexamethasone, panobinostat, carfilzomib, pomalidomide, lenalidomide, and bortezomib, respectively. The model had a 1-year time horizon. Progression-free survival (PFS) Kaplan-Meier curves of these treatments among RRMM patients with at least 2 prior regimens was obtained from the literature where direct evidence was available, otherwise, was estimated by adjusting the PFS of the respective treatments among RRMM patients with at least 1 prior regimen. The durations of PFS within 1 year were estimated using area under the curve method. The cost per treated patient, from a US payer perspective, was estimated, composed of drug costs, administration costs, monitoring and prophylaxis costs, costs for treating adverse events, and costs incurred following disease progression or death. The cost per month free of progression or death was estimated for each regimen, by using cost per treated patient divided by duration of PFS within 1 year. Results: The duration of PFS (months), in descending order, within 1 year of treatment initiation were 10.2, 8.6, 7.8, 7.6, 6.4, 5.4, 5.1 for KRD, FVD, RVD, RD, VD, PD and K, respectively. The costs ($) per month free of progression or death for these regimens were 22,714, 15,860, 22,201, 16,380, 17,665, 25,417, and 21,158, respectively. Conclusion: The results suggested that KRD and FVD were associated with longer PFS duration compared to other targeted therapy regimens; FVD and RD were associated with a lower cost per month free of progression or death. Cost per month free of progression or death presented a new metric which might be considered when evaluating treatment options.
