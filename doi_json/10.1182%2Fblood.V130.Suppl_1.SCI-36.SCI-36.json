    "abstract_text": "Dr. Vignali will discuss the biology of the inhibitory receptor LAG3, and its contribution to T cell exhaustion and immune regulation on CD8 + and CD4 + intratumoral T cells in mouse models of cancer and autoimmunity, and in a variety of human malignancies. He will also discuss the impact of LAG3 on regulatory T cell function. Given the considerable interest in inhibitory receptors in general, and LAG3 recently, as immunotherapeutic targets, he will also discuss how differential LAG3 expression could impact responsiveness to immunotherapy.
