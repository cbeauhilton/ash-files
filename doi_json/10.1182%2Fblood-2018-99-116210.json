    "abstract_text": "Aim: The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, complications and long term results of splenectomy in children with hematologic diseases. Patients and Methods: This study includes retrospective analysis of the medical records of 158 children between 0-18 years old who underwent splenectomy due to hematologic diseases from 1989 to 2017. Gender, splenectomy indications, age of diagnosis, splenectomy age, vaccination status, splenectomy outcomes, complications and mortality were evaluated. Results: Of the cases, 88 (55.7%) were female and 70 were male (44.3%). Indications for splenectomy were hereditary spherocytosis in 59 (37.3%), immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in 50 (31.6%) and thalassemia major in 40 (25.3%) children. The median age of diagnosis was 3.9 years, the median splenectomy age was 9.2 years, the median time from diagnosis to splenectomy was 5.3 years in all cohort. Mean follow-up time of patients after splenectomy was 7.3\u00b15.2 years. All patients except one were immunized before splenectomy. Responses were assessed based on standart criteria for each disease. Response was seen in 94.7% of patients with hereditary spherocytosis and 80% of ITP patients. Twenty-two percent of splenectomised children with thalassemia major had a decrease in transfusion frequency. Infections following splenectomy were reported in 22.8%. One patient had thrombosis related to splenectomy, none of the cases had major bleeding. There was no death due to sepsis. One patient with ITP died due to Subacute Sclerosing Panencephilitis (SSPE). Conclusion: Splecetomy is associated with good remission rates following ITP and hereditary spherocytosis. Splenectomy should be performed only in selected cases with transfusion dependent thalassemia. Post-splenectomy sepsis is uncommon. Future studies should focus on health quality of life and cost analysis of splenectomy in children. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
