    "abstract_text": "Background B-cells play a significant role in chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). Male patients with female donors (F\u2192M) are at a higher risk of developing cGVHD. B cell responses against minor histocompatibility antigens encoded on the Y chromosome, called H-Y antigens, develop following F\u2192M HCT patients in association with cGVHD (Miklos, Blood. 2005 & Sahaf, PNAS. 2013). Here we present our novel HY microarray and use this sensitive technology to determine temporal development of HY antibody (Ab) preceding cGVHD. Multivariate analyses demonstrate that HY-Ab detection 3 months (3m) post HCT predicts cGHVD incidence and non-relapse mortality (NRM). Methods We studied 136 adult male recipients of F\u2192M HCT between 2005 and 2012 who survived without relapse for at least 3m post-HCT with 3m plasma available. Median patient age was 53 (21-74). Related donors were transplanted in 85 (63%) and 128 (94%) were PBSC grafts. Reduced intensity conditioning accounted for 61 (45%) and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) was used in 71 (52%). Thirty-one patients (23%) experienced grade II-IV acute GVHD. We measured IgG against six HY antigens (DBY, UTY, ZFY, SMCY, EIF1AY, and RBS4Y) from plasma collected 3m post-HCT using a novel proteomic microarray here presented for the first time. The cut-off value for seropositivity was defined as the third quartile + 2x the interquartile range, determined from plasma of 60 male donors. HY-score was defined as the cumulative number of HY antigen targeted by Abs at 3m post-HCT. Results The frequencies of HY antigen-specific Ab are presented in Table 1 , showing that SMCY and UTY were most frequently detected and overall, 78 (57%) had developed allo-Ab against any of these 6 HY antigens. Each HY-Ab was significantly associated with the development of cGVHD and DBY was greatest. LASSO analysis suggested that DBY, UTY, and ZFY were the most predictive for the development of cGVHD ( Table 1 ). Univariate analysis failed to identify associations between clinical features and the development of HY-Ab at 3m. The detection of HY-Ab gradually increased within the 1 st year post HCT and seropositivity for each HY-IgG (except RPS4Y) persisted. Considering each HY-IgG response by principal component analysis, a higher HY-score was associated with an increased risk for the development of cGVHD and NRM, after adjusting for usual alloHCT clinical factors ( Table 2 ). In addition, the severity of cGVHD was significantly associated with the HY-score: the proportion of severe/moderate cGVHD was 33% in 0, 30% in 1, 60% in 2-3, and 70% in 4-6 (P<0.01). Table 1.  .

Conclusion Here, we show that HY Ab detection 3m following sex-mismatch HCT actually predicts the development of cGVHD, independently from clinical risk factors. In addition, the combination of HY-score and clinical factors had a greater predictive potential than clinical factors alone for the development of cGVHD in F\u2192M HCT. HY-Ab development 3m post HCT may stratify cGVHD risk and support B-cell-depletion therapy beginning 3 months or earlier to prevent cGVHD development.
