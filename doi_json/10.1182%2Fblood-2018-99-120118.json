    "abstract_text": "This study is to investigate the survival impact of thiotepa as part of the conditioning therapy for \u03b2 thalassemia major (TM) patients, undergoing HSCT from haploidentical and sibling cord blood transplant. We retrospectively analyzed 262 transplant patients and compared outcomes between Cyclophosphamide -fludarabinebusulfan - thiotepa (with TT group)and Cyclophosphamide fludarabine -busulfan(without TT group) regimens from July 2014 to July 2018. Transplantation was performed from 86 matched sibling (32.8%), 103 unrelated (39.3%) ,13 matched parent(5%), 41 haploidentical (15.6%), and 19 sibling cord blood (7.3%) donors, with a median follow-up of 27 months(1months-72months) and median age of 7 years old(2 ys-18ys). The overall survival (OS), thalassemia free survival (TFS), graft rejection (GR) and transplantation related mortality (TRM) among TT group and without TT group in matched sibling transplant patients was 97.6%, 97.6%, 0%, 2.4% and91.6%, 91.6%, 0%, 8.4% (P=0.355 in TFS), respectively; in unrelated transplant patients was 97.9%, 97.9%, 0%, 2.1% and 95.2%,93.3%, 1.9%, 4.8% (P=0.256 in TFS), respectively; in matched parent transplant was 90.9%, 90.9%, 0%, 9.1% and 100%. 100%, 0%, 0%;( P=0.546 in TFS), respectively; whereas, in haploidentical transplant was 100%, 96.9%, 3.1%, 0% and 88.9%, 77.8%, 12.5%, 11.1%(P=0.043 in TFS); and in sibling cord blood transplant was 100%, 100%, 0%, 0% and 100%, 62.3%, 29.9%, 0% (P=0.035 in TFS). Our data suggest that thiotepa-based conditioning regimen in TM is effective and safe and survival outcome of thiotepa-based regimen in haploidentical transplant and sibling cord blood transplant are encouraging. Thiotepa-based regimen may improve survival outcome in haploidentical transplant and sibling cord blood transplant. Figure. View large Download slide Figure.
