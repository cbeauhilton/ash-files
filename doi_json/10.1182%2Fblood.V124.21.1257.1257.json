    "abstract_text": "Objective Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT) is not widely used for patients with b-thalassemia major (TM) so far because of transplant toxicities. Furthermore the tangible outcomes of contemporary HSCTs in Asia are unknown. Methods A newly founded consortium named the Viva-Asia BMT Group collected HSCT data retrospectively and investigated whether TM-HSCT outcomes had improved in recent years in Asia and whether an upper age limit can be determined for safe transplantation. Results From 1991 to 2012, 422 TM-HSCTs were performed among the 8 Asian centers; half (n=209) were before January 2009 (early cohort) and the other half (n=213) were performed thereafter (recent cohort). All major outcomes including overall survival (OS), TM-free survival (TFS), incidences of graft rejection (GR) and transplant-related mortality (TRM) improved significantly in the recent cohort (OS 93.4%, TFS 88.6%, GR 4.4% and TRM 6.6%) when compared with the earlier cohort (OS 84%, TFS 68.1%, GR 17.1% and TRM 16%). In the recent cohort, favorable OS, TFS, GR and TRM were observed with unrelated donors (n=168, 92.8%, 87.8%, 4.2% and 7.2%, respectively), with one-antigen mismatched parental donors (n=26,100%, 100%, 0% and 0%, respectively), and in patients younger than 10 years (n=173, 96%, 90.8%, 4.7% and 4.0%, respectively). TFS with unrelated cord blood (35.3%) was poor. Conclusion The excellent outcomes of contemporary TM-HSCT in general suggest that transplantation is a viable option for many Asian patients, particularly those younger than 10 years from areas with limited resources for chronic transfusion and iron chelation.
