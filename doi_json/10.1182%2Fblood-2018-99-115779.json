    "abstract_text": "Backgroud Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a potential life-threatening hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) disorder resulting in cytopenia. The first line therapy for AA is HSC transplantation for young patients who have suitable donors and immunosuppressive therapy (IST) with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine for the remaining patients. However, about 30% of patients are refractory to IST or relapse after IST. IST with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine result in severe complication and mortality infection. To reduce the mortality infection and increase the response of IST for AA is still problem. Eltrombopag, a thrombopoietin mimetic, demonstrated efficacy in restoring trilineage hematopoiesis, has recently emerged as an encouraging and promising agent for patients with refractory AA. To explore the effect of eltrombopag for severe acquired aplastic anemia, we treated seven severe AA patients with eltrombopag combined with cyclosporine and G-CSF. Herein we report initial results of the eltrombopag combined with cyclosporine and G-CSF for severe AA. Methods The diagnostic of AA patient consisted of a complete blood count, a bone marrow biopsy, bone marrow karyotype analysis and assessment of a paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) clone. Patients with SAA aged \u226518 years old who without suitable donors received eltrombopag 75mg/d, cyclosporine 6mg/kg by oral, and G-CSF 300ug/d by subcutaneous injection from diagnosis. Red blood was infused to maintained HB more than 60g/L. Platelet were infused to maintained PLT more than 20x10 9 /L. G-CSF was administered until neutrophil count more than 1.0x10 9 /L. Vale concentration of cyclosporine were maintained more than 100ug/ml in blood plasm and maintained two years. Eltrombopag was taper down when platelet was more than 100x10 9 /L. Eltrombopag was given at least three months. Antibacterial was administered when patient was high fever. Posaconazole were given for fungal infections prophylaxsis. Hematologic improvements were assessed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) response criteria for AA. Results The median age of 7 patients with SAA was 44 years old (range 19-68 yr). Full hematologic improvements were achieved in 3 patients. All patients achieved platelet and RBC infusion independence. The median time from the first eltrombopag therapy to platelet infusion independence was 35 days (range 33-46d). The median time from the first eltrombopag therapy to RBC infusion independence was 40 days (range 30-50d). Median 6 units (1200ml) (range 3-10U, 600ml -2000ml) RBC and 7 units (2.5x10 9 /unit) platelet were infused. With median 8 months follow-up (3-12 months),3 patients are still full hematologic improvements and 4 platelet and RBC infusion independence. No severe fugual infection was observed in this group patients. ALT slightly elevate in one patient. No other severe adverse effect was observed. Conclusions Treatment of SAA patients with G-CSF\u3001cyclosporine combined with eltrombopag is feasible and effect. Our results deserve further research and confirmation in larger samples.
