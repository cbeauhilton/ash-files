    "abstract_text": "Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder in which autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells target the destruction of platelets and megakaryocytes in the spleen and bone marrow. Several therapeutic options e.g. steroids, IVIg, Rituximab and thrombopoietin mimetics, are available for patients but inadequate efficacy, side effects and/or expense can make them undesirable. PRTX-100 is a highly purified formulation of Staphylococcal Protein A that has been evaluated in clinical trials with rheumatoid arthritis patients. Here, we analyzed the efficacy of PRTX-100 in raising platelet counts in a well-established murine model of ITP that demonstrates both antibody- and T cell-mediated thrombocytopenia. Platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIIa (CD61) knockout (KO) mice were immunized with CD61 + platelets and ITP was initiated by transfer of their splenocytes into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. On day 10, post transfer, the SCID mice were treated with either placebo, 1g/kg IVIg (ip, biweekly) or doses of PRTX-100 (iv, biweekly, 2.5-250 ug/kg) and platelet counts were measured weekly. Results show that control SCID mice transferred with 1x10 4 splenocytes from immune CD61 KO mice became thrombocytopenic at day 7 post-transfer and remained extremely thrombocytopenic throughout the 28 day protocol (3 mice died from bleeding diatheses). Similar observations were found with SCID mice given placebo. In contrast, however, transferred SCID mice treated with either IVIg or the PRTX-100 doses had platelet counts that increased to within normal levels within 1-2 weeks after treatment and none of the mice died (Table 1).
