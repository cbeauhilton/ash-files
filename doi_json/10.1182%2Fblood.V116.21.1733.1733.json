    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1733 Targeted therapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have significantly improved the treatment of cancer patients. Ex vivo generated dendritic cells (DC) are commonly used in immunotherapeutic strategies due to their unique ability to initiate adaptive immune responses, and multiple approaches presently aim to combine targeted therapies with immunotherapy. However, as many kinases targeted by TKI are, besides governing tumor cell growth, also involved in the activation of DC, TKI therapy may cause immunoinhibitory side effects. Osteoactivin (GPNMB, DC-HIL) is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is detected abundantly in DC but not in monocytes. Its expression on antigen-presenting cells can inhibit T cell activation by binding syndecan-4 (SD-4) on T cells. Here we investigated the effect of the BCR/ABL TKI imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib, which are approved for the treatment of CML, on the expression of osteoactivin and DC functions. DC were generated from blood monocytes by plastic adherence and exposure to GM-CSF and IL-4. Imatinib, nilotinib or dasatinib were added to the culture medium every second day starting from the first day of culture. In some experiments, toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands (L) (LPS (TLR4L), pam3Cys (TLR2L), poly I:C (TLR3L) or R848 (TLR7/8L) were added on day 6 of culture for maturation of DC. We found that DC generated in the presence of therapeutic concentrations of all three TKI displayed an altered phenotype. Imatinib caused significantly reduced expression of the typical DC markers CD1a, CD83 and the co-stimulatory molecule CD86. Nilotinib reduced the expression of CD1a, CD83, CD86 and the DC-specific C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN (CD209). Dasatinib impaired expression of CD1a, CD83, CD86, CD80 and DC-SIGN. Most notably, we observed excessive up-regulation of osteoactivin on DC upon treatment with all three TKI. Interestingly, incubation with the immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 also resulted in osteoactivin over-expression. In line with osteoactivin up-regulation, exposure to TKI resulted in reduced stimulatory capacity of DC in MLR with allogenic T cells that could be restored by addition of blocking anti-osteoactivin antibody. In summary, our data demonstrate that up-regulation of osteoactivin is critically involved in the inhibition of DC function upon TKI exposure. These findings are of great importance for future combinatory approaches using TKI and DC-based immunotherapy and indicate that inhibition of osteoactivin expression or function may serve as a novel strategy to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapeutic interventions in cancer patients.
