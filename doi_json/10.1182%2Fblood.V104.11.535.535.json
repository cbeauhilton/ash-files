    "abstract_text": "High dose therapy (HDT) supported with autologous stem cell transplantation has been introduced in the management of aggressive myeloma. However, after single or tandem transplantation, almost all patients ultimately relapse. New strategies are required to control any residual disease after HDT. The Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome (IFM) initiated a trial designed to evaluate the impact of maintenance treatment with Thalidomide on the duration of response after HDT. From April 2000 to October 2003, 1004 myeloma patients at diagnosis under the age of 65 years were enrolled in the IFM 99 protocol. 780 of them, without or with only one adverse prognostic factor (beta-2 microglobuline >3 mg/l or deletion of chromosome 13), were enrolled in the IFM 99 02 protocol. They were to receive the following treatment: 1) 3\u20134 cycles of the VAD regimen; 2) a first autologous transplant prepared with Melphalan 140 mg/m2; 3) a second autologous transplant prepared with Melphalan 200 mg/m2. Patients without progressive disease 2 months after the second transplant were randomized to receive: no maintenance treatment (arm A), maintenance treatment with Pamidronate (arm B) or maintenance treatment with Thalidomide and Pamidronate (arm C). As of May 2004, 580 patients (74%) have been randomized: 195 in arm A, 190 in arm B and 195 in arm C. Clinical characteristics of each group were similar. The median follow-up from diagnosis was 26 months (range: 6\u201350) Thalidomide was found to improve the Progression-free survival (PFS; p<0.007) and the Event-free-survival (EFS; p<0.01). Indeed, the 40-months post-diagnosis probability of PFS was 70% (95% CI= 42\u201380) in the Thalidomide arm versus 53% (95% CI= 37\u201365) in arm A, and 52% (95% CI= 36\u201368) in arm B. Most patients (60%) enrolled in arm A and B received Thalidomide at time of relapse. The overall survival was similar in the 3 treatment groups. Among the 580 randomized patients, 2 factors were found to be associated with a longer EFS : low beta-2-microglobulin at diagnosis (p<0.01) and treatment arm (p<0.01). Deletion of chromosome 13 (FISH analysis) was not related to EFS. In conclusion, the first analysis of the IFM9902 trial strongly suggests that Thalidomide is an effective maintenance treatment after high dose therapy for myeloma. The next analysis (November 2004) will be presented during the meeting.",
