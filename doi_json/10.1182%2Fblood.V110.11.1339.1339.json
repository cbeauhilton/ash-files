    "abstract_text": "IL-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine synthesized by a newly discovered subset of helper T-cells called T H 17. In our search for targets that are regulated by IL-17, we have found that the gene for the bacteriostatic protein neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) is strongly induced in epithelial cells by this cytokine. NGAL is a siderophore-binding protein that binds bacterial catecholate-type ferric siderophores and exerts a bacteriostatic effect under iron limiting conditions. It has been observed that NGAL synthesis is induced in inflamed epithelium of the lungs and colon. Using the type II pneumocyt-derived cell line A549 as a model, we found that NGAL was up-regulated 27-fold at RNA level, and 14-fold at protein level, when co-stimulated for 24 hours with IL-17 (200ng/ml) and TNF\u03b1 (20ng/ml), whereas no induction was seen with either cytokine alone compared to unstimulated cells. The expression of NGAL in A549 cells, when stimulated with IL-17 and TNF\u03b1, was dependent on de novo protein synthesis as demonstrated by inhibition of NGAL mRNA production by cycloheximide. Deletion and substitution analysis of the NGAL promoter and subsequent stimulation of transfected cells with IL-17 and TNF\u03b1 showed that a functional NF-\u03baB-binding site was essential for promoter activation whereas AP-1 and C/EBP-sites were dispensable. Quantitative RT-PCR showed a 13-fold induction of IkB-\u03b6 mRNA in A549 cells when stimulated with IL-17 and TNF\u03b1 with peak level at 1\u00bd hours and a slow decline for up to 24 hours. Cells stimulated with IL-17 alone resulted in 8-fold mRNA induction at 1\u00bd hours followed by a decline to a 3-fold induction level of mRNA, which lasted for 24 hours. In contrast, cells stimulated with TNF\u03b1 showed a 9-fold mRNA induction at 1\u00bd hours but then rapidly returned to back-ground level at 3 hours post-induction. These data, and previous studies of the NGAL promoter (Cowland et al. (2006), 176, 5559), demonstrates that the NGAL promoter requires binding of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB as well as the NF-\u03baB-binding co-factor IkB-\u03b6 for transcriptional activation. Our data indicate that TNF\u03b1 stimulates transcription of the IkB-\u03b6 gene and NF-\u03baB binding to the NGAL promoter whereas IL-17 stabilizes IkB-\u03b6 mRNA and thus enables translation of this co-factor. Only when acting together the two cytokines induce the formation of an NF-\u03baB:I\u03baB-\u03b6-complex that can stimulate NGAL transcription. We have found that human b-defensin 2 (hBD2) is regulated in the same manner. The functions of NGAL and hBD2 in the innate immune response are well characterized, and the present data demonstrates that IL-17, which is synthesized only by the newly discovered T H -17 cell population, is involved in transcriptional regulation of these effector molecules. The data furthermore demonstrate that cells of the adaptive immune system is able to activate genes of the innate immune system."
