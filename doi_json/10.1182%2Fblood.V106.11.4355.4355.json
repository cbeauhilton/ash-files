    "abstract_text": "p15 and p14/p16 tumor suppressor genes, have been reported to be frequently inactivated by various mechanisms in haematological malignancies such us MM. Alterations of these cell cycle inhibitors in MM display a close correlation with the cell cycle and clinical outcome. We have evaluated by real time quantitative RT-PCR (RQ-PCR) the expression of the p14/p16 and p15 genes in purified bone marrow plasma cells (PBMPC) from MM patients in order to evaluate the possible clinical, biological and prognostic significance of these cell cycle regulators. RNA extracted from purified BMPC from 53 untreated symptomatic MM and a pool of buffy coat from healthy donors (reference value) was analyzed by RQ-PCR using Assays-on-Demand gene expression mixes specific for p14/p16 and p15 genes in an ABI PRISM 7700 SDS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Values were corrected with a control gene ( ABL ). The relative quantification of gene expression was performed through the cycle threshold (C T ) increment method. Patients were classified into different groups depending on gene expression values. Thus, according to p15 expression, 29% of patients (n=14) showed higher levels than the control and this group was characterized by the presence of good prognostic markers such us low Lactato dehidrogenase levels (LDH), low b2-microglobulin (B2M) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) serum levels and absence of monoclonal proteinuria. Similar results were found for p14/p16 expression. Fifteen patients (28%) displayed a high p14/p16 expression and the group was also characterized by good prognostic features: low CRP, B2M and LDH levels. When p14/p16 and p15 genes were simultaneously analyzed, clinical and biological parameters showed a statistically significant correlation with gene expression. Thus patients with low gene expression had a high B2M (\u22653 mg/dl) and high C-reactive protein (\u22653 mg/dl). As far as survival was concerned, patients with a high p15 expression had a longer overall survival of 100% vs. 58% at 30 months (p=0,01), with the additional value that no deaths have been observed in any such patients. Similar results were observed for the group of patients displaying a high p14/p16 expression since they displayed a much better OS (100% vs. 63% at 30 months, p=0,02). Again, we should note that no deaths have been presented in this group. All these findings were much more evident when the three genes were simultaneously considered. Thus, within the group of 21 patients with at least one of the two genes overexpressed there have been no deaths vs. 11 among the 27 patients with low levels. This resulted in quite different OS curves for the two groups of patients (Figure 1) of 100% vs. 49% at 30 months (p=0,00). In conclusion, these genes significantly determine patients\u2019 outcome thanks to their ability to classify them into different groups with different clinical, biological and outcome characteristics.",
