    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2214 Exosite binding plays a key role in cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13 (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease with ThromboSpondin type 1 repeats, 13). Two exosites that are evolutionarily conserved from zebra fish to mammals have been identified in the spacer domain by sequence alignment. Previous studies have shown that exosite 3 in the spacer domain plays a critical role for substrate recognition ( Blood 115:2300\u201310, 2010), and modification of this exosite generates ADAMTS13 variants with improved specific activity but reduced autoantibody binding (Blood 119:3836\u201343, 2012 ). In the present study, using a site-directed mutagenesis approach, we identified a novel exosite near exosite 3 in the spacer domain, termed exosite 4, a region between residues Glu 634 and Arg 639 . A partial (\u0394Ex4a:deletion of Leu 632 -Asp 635 or \u0394Ex4b:deletion of Arg 636 -Arg 639 ) or complete deletion of the exosite (\u0394Ex4) significantly impaired proteolytic activity towards peptidyl VWF73 and multimeric VWF. Moreover, substitution of all surface exposed residues in Ex4A (LTED/AAAA) or Ex4b (RLPR/AAAA) with alanine had a similarly detrimental effect on proteolytic activity. Further studies demonstrated that the residues Asp 635 and Arg 636 in exosite 4 play a critical role for substrate recognition. We conclude that the region between residues Glu 634 and Arg 639 is a novel exosite necessary for recognition and cleavage of VWF. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
