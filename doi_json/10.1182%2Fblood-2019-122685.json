    "abstract_text": "Introduction : \u03b2-thalassemia is an inherited hemoglobinopathy characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and anemia. Luspatercept is a first-in-class erythroid maturation agent that binds to select TGF-\u03b2 superfamily ligands to reduce aberrant Smad2/3 signaling and enhance late-stage erythropoiesis. We aim to evaluate in detail the number of response episodes, duration of clinical benefit, and safety in luspatercept responders during the phase 3 BELIEVE study (NCT02604433). Methods : Eligible pts were aged \u2265 18 years, with \u03b2-thalassemia or hemoglobin (Hb) E/\u03b2-thalassemia (compound \u03b2-thalassemia mutation and/or multiplication of \u03b1-globin genes was allowed), requiring regular transfusions of 6-20 RBC units in the 24 weeks (wks) prior to randomization, with no transfusion-free period > 35 days. Pts were randomized 2:1 to luspatercept 1.0 mg/kg (up to 1.25 mg/kg allowed), or placebo, subcutaneously every 3 wks for \u2265 48 wks. Pts in both treatment arms continued RBC transfusions to maintain baseline Hb level and iron chelation therapy. Achievement and number of response episodes (defined as \u2265 33% reduction in RBC transfusion from baseline over any consecutive 24 wks) were assessed at a median follow-up of 64.1 wks. Duration of clinical benefit, defined as the time of first response (\u2265 33% reduction in RBC transfusion over any 24 wks) to discontinuation due to any cause at that episode, was also assessed. Results :A total of 336 pts were randomized. In the ITT population, 224 pts in the luspatercept arm had a median baseline RBC transfusion burden in the 12 wks prior to randomization of 6.12 U RBCs (average 0.51 U/wk; range 3-14) and the 112 pts in the placebo arm had a median baseline transfusion burden of 6.27 U (average 0.52 U/wk; range 3-12). A total of 194 (57.7%) luspatercept and 65 (58%) placebo pts had prior splenectomy. As of the May 11, 2018 cutoff date, 92/224 (41.1%) luspatercept-treated pts and 3/112 (2.7%) placebo-treated pts had achieved \u2265 33% reduction in RBC transfusion over any 24 wks; of these luspatercept responders, 55 (59.8%) had \u2265 2 separate responses (over the treatment period up to data cutoff), 42 (45.7%) had \u2265 3, 29 (31.5%) had \u2265 4, and 19 (20.7%) had \u2265 5. Three (1.3%) pts receiving luspatercept re-responded at the same dose level after initially losing response. Median duration of clinical benefit (as defined above) for luspatercept responders was 53.5 wks (range 24-93.7). Forty-seven (21.0%) pts receiving luspatercept had no loss of response within the entire study period. Five luspatercept responders achieved RBC transfusion independence for \u2265 24 wks (median total duration was 60.1 wks) and 3 achieved RBC transfusion independence for \u2265 48 wks (median duration was 66 wks). The average number of RBC units saved over any 24 wks in all luspatercept responders was 6.55 U (0.27 U/wk) and was 8.16 U (0.34 U/wk) with transfusion burden > 15 U/24 wks, compared to baseline. As of the May 11, 2018 cutoff date, the safety population consisted of 243 pts (including 92 pts who crossed over from the placebo arm to the luspatercept arm). Frequent adverse events (AEs) in the luspatercept and placebo arms included bone pain (19.7% vs 8.3%, respectively), arthralgia (19.3% vs 11.9%), and dizziness (11.2% vs 4.6%). The safety profile for pts who crossed over from placebo to luspatercept was consistent with that observed for pts receiving luspatercept from baseline. The incidence of bone pain, arthralgia, and dizziness was largely non-severe grade 1-2, tended to decrease over time during the study, was not associated with dose level, and was not associated with treatment modification or discontinuation. Pts continue to be monitored for safety outcomes. Conclusions : Most \u03b2-thalassemia pts who were luspatercept responders experienced multiple response periods and had durable clinical benefit over the 64.1 wk follow-up period. The incidence of frequent AEs was consistent with the previously reported 48 wk safety profile for luspatercept, was not associated with dose level, and decreased over time with no impact on treatment modification or continuation.
