    "abstract_text": "Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) technique is the only validated non-invasive approach used for detecting macroscopic myocardial fibrosis. Galectin-3 has been shown to participate in tissue fibrogenesis and was already associated with LGE-assessed myocardial replacement fibrosis in a cohort of patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NICM). Our aim was to investigate the relationships between galectin-3 circulating level and myocardial fibrosis in patients with thalassemia major (TM) who underwent CMR technique during the Myocardial Iron Overload in Thalassemia (MIOT) project. All patients underwent also an extensive biohumoral characterization, including Troponin, NT Pro BnP, BNP, VES, PCR assay. At UOSD Malattie rare del globule Rosso of Cardarelli hospital (Naples, Italia), between January 2015 and March 2016, all patients who underwent contrast-enhanced CMR were progressively enrolled to test Galectin-3. Eighty-six patients were evaluated (males 43%; age 37, SD 8 years): six (7%) had diabetes mellitus (DM), 64 had anti-HCV antibodies and 28 (32%) were HCV RNA positive. Median galectin-3 value was 14.04ng/mL (5.26 ng/mL), and LGE was detected in 42 (49%) patients. Patients with LGE had higher galectin-3 than those without (14.48 \u00b1 5.98, vs 13.63 \u00b1 5.98), but without a statistically significant difference (p=0.109). Galectin-3 was significantly associated with age (R=0.34; p=0.001), but not with sex. Patients with DM, with anti-HCV antibodies and with HCV-RNA positivity, had significant higher level of Galectin 3 with respect to those without (22.5\u00b1 11.1 vs 13.4\u00b1 4, p=0.009; 14.9 \u00b1 5.4 vs 11.5\u00b1 3.7, p=0.001; 16.2 \u00b1 6.5 vs 13\u00b1 4.2, p=0.011, respectively). No correlation was found between Galectin 3 and other tested biochemical variables and iron overload and cardiac parameters. In conclusion, in our cohort of TM patients there was a great prevalence of myocardial fibrosis. In patients with myocardial fibrosis, the level of galectin-3 was higher and comparable to that found in a previous study performed in patients with NICM, but not significantly different with respect to those without fibrosis. The elevated prevalence of patients with previous exposure to HCV virus and/or DM and/or iron overload may significantly influence Galectin-3 level limiting the ability of the marker to identify patients without fibrosis.
