    "abstract_text": "Nucleases capable of making targeted breaks in genomic DNA are a core technology required for genome engineering, an emerging field of technology for making precise alterations in cellular genomes. Over the past ten years, four major platforms have emerged for generation of nucleases able to make targeted DNA breaks with a high degree of efficiency and specificity: homing endonucleases, zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like (TAL) effector nucleases, and RNA-guided nucleases. This talk will cover the biochemistry and platform-specific attributes of each type of nuclease, along with evolution/improvements in nucleases and related technologies and aspects of the practical implementation of nuclease technology for gene knockout and gene repair in primary hematopoietic cells.
