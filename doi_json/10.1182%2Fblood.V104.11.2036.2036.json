    "abstract_text": "Gene promoter methylation is a major mechanism of transcriptional silencing in cancer cells that is mediated by CpG methylation and histone deacetylase activity, with methylation being dominant. Importantly, pharmacological treatment of cancer cells with inhibitors of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation have been shown to synergistically reactivate transcription of previously silenced genes. In an effort to identify novel genes silenced by DNA methylation in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we used cDNA microarray technology to screen for genes upregulated in the human cell line AML193 following treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC), and the histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A (TSA). Analysis of 1,700 gene microarrays in triplicate revealed seven genes consistently upregulated by combined 5-Aza-dC and TSA treatment, all of which were confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Interestingly, four of these genes (MT1H, MT1E, MT2A, MT1G) are members of the metallothionein family of cysteine-rich small molecular weight proteins. These proteins are considered to be important mediators of cellular detoxification and are induced by toxic heavy metals, UV irradiation and reactive oxygen species. As well, MT1G promoter methylation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic papillary thyroid carcinoma. The methylation status of candidate metallothionein genes reactivated by 5-Aza-dC and TSA treatment in AML193 cells was assessed by methylation specific PCR (MSP) in seven human AML cell lines. Methylated promoter alleles were detected in MT1H, MT1E and MT1G in 71%, 29% and 29% of cell lines, respectively, and there was no methylation of MT2A in any of the cell lines tested. To investigate for the occurrence of MT1H, MT1E and MT1G methylation in human AML in vivo , we analyzed AML patient blasts (n=39) and non-leukemic controls (n=13) by MSP. MT1H, MT1E and MT1G methylation was detected in 51%, 0% and 3% of AML patient samples, respectively, and there was no methylation of any of these genes in control samples. Our findings implicate MT1H promoter methylation in the pathogenesis of human AML and suggest that the use of cDNA microarray technology following pharmacological manipulation is a useful approach for identifying novel epigenetically silenced genes in this disease.",
