    "abstract_text": "Recent studies indicate that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are capable of reconstituting a number of non-hematopoietic organs and tissues. To define the potential of the HSC precisely, we initiated transplantation studies of a clonal population of cells derived from a single HSC. We used the bone marrow (BM) of transgenic enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) mice as the source of donor HSCs. We demonstrated the HSC origin of glomerular mesangial cells (Masuya et al, Blood 101: 2215, 2003) and brain microglial cells and pericyte-like perivascular cells (Hess et al, Exp Neurol 186: 134, 2004). These observations and the fact that glomerular mesangial cells and pericytes are considered myofibroblasts suggested that fibroblasts are also derived from HSCs. In this abstract, we present evidence for HSC origin of fibroblasts and their precursors, BM fibroblast colony-forming units (CFU-F) and peripheral blood (PB) fibrocytes. Lin \u2212 Sca-1 + c-Kit + CD34 \u2212 cells from the BM of adult EGFP mice were individually sorted into 96 well Corning plates and cultured for 7 days in the presence of Steel factor and IL-11 or Steel factor and G-CSF. Viable clones consisting of fewer than 20 cells were individually transplanted into lethally irradiated mice. EGFP + mononuclear cells were sorted from the BM cells of recipients showing high-level, multilineage hematopoietic reconstitution and assayed for CFU-F in Retronectin-treated tissue culture plates. Colonies consisting of more than 50 adherent cells were all EGFP + . The majority of the cells comprising the colonies were fibroblast-like, exhibited spindle-shaped or polygonal cytoplasm and had clear, ovoid nuclei. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that these cells expressed collagen-1 and discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) and exhibited a decreased intensity of CD45. RT-PCR analysis of these cells revealed the presence of mRNA for procollagen 1 alpha-1, vimentin, fibronectin and DDR2. Next we analyzed the PB for donor origin fibrocytes, a fibroblast-like cell type that expresses both fibroblastic and hematopoietic phenotypes in culture. When nucleated PB cells from clonally engrafted mice were cultured on fibronectin-coated dishes, proliferation of EGFP + fibroblast-like cells was detected. Only one-third of the EGFP + cells expressed CD45 and most of the EGFP + cells expressed both collagen-I and DDR2. Similar results were obtained with EGFP + cells from mice transplanted with 100 uncultured Lin \u2212 Sca-1 + c-Kit + CD34 \u2212 cells or 1x10 6 BM nucleated cells. These studies excluded the effects of short-term culture on HSC differentiation and established the HSC origin of CFU-F and fibrocytes. Classic studies of CFU-F by Friedenstein and others have led to the general belief that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), rather than HSCs, generate a number of tissues including adipocytes, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, myocytes and vascular endothelial cells. Here we unequivocally demonstrated that CFU-F are of HSC origin, warranting a re-evaluation of the relationship between HSCs and MSCs."
