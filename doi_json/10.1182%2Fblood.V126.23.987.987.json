    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Renal damage is a progressive complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) that begins with hyerfiltration in childhood followed by decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and chronic renal failure in up to 12% of HbSS adults. Albuminuria is a marker of glomerular damage but does not predict GFR. Serum creatinine (SCr) is typically low in SCD despite glomerular damage, in part because tubular dysfunction leads to increased creatinine secretion. Cystatin C (CysC) is a low molecular weight protein, eliminated exclusively by glomerular filtration, and correlates with GFR in children and adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Previously, estimated GFR (eGFR) has been compared to measured GFR (mGFR) using equations that incorporate CysC and SCr in young children with SCD; however no studies have examined the precision or accuracy of GFR formulas in adults and older children with SCD. Methods: Adults and children \u226510 years with HbSS and albuminuria (albumin/creatinine ratio \u226530 mg/g) who were on hydroxyurea therapy for \u22656 months were enrolled on a trial of losartan therapy to determine effects on albuminuria and renal hemodynamics. GFR was measured by urinary clearance of intravenous iohexol at baseline and 2 time points subsequent to starting losartan. Serum creatinine and CysC were measured using standard clinical laboratory techniques. For subjects age \u226518 years, eGFR was calculated using 3 CysC-based equations that have high accuracy in adults with CKD: (1) eGFR = 76.7 x [CysC(mg/L)] -1.19 ; (2) eGFR = 127.7 x [CysC(mg/L)] -1.17 x age -0.13 x 0.91 (female) x 1.06 (African American) ; (3) eGFR = 177.6 x [SCr(mg/dL)] -0.65 x [CysC(mg/L)] -0.57 x age -0.20 x 0.80 (female) x 1.11 (African American) . In subjects <18 years, eGFR was calculated by: (1) modified Schwartz formula, eGFR = height in cm x 0.41/SCr(mg/dL), and (2) CKiD Schwartz formula: eGFR = 39.1 x [height (m)/SCr] 0.516 x [1.8/CysC (mg/L)] 0.294 x [30/BUN (mg/dL)] 0.169 x 1.099 (male) x [height(m)/1.4] 0.188 . The relation of serum CysC with mGFR was determined by Pearson's correlation. Bias was assessed as the median difference between eGFR and mGFR, and precision as the interquartile range (IQR) for the difference. Accuracy was assessed as the percent of estimates within 10% (P 10 ), 30% (P 30 ) and 50% (P 50 ) of mGFR. Results: In 15 subjects (4 female, 1 300 mg/g). Mean SCr was 0.58 mg/dL, mean CysC was 0.74 mg/L (normal 0.5 - 1.0 mg/L), and mean mGFR was 106.9 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (range 68 - 147). Four (27%) subjects had stage 2 CKD (GFR <90 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) measured at 7 time points prior to losartan. CysC correlated inversely with mGFR (r= -0.58, p=0.0003) (Figure) and was higher in those with stage 2 CKD vs. stage 1 (mean 0.95 vs. 0.68 mg/L, p=0.0013). CysC was above laboratory-defined normal range in 2/26 (7%) with stage 1 CKD and 3/7 (43%) with stage 2 CKD (p=0.052). For subjects \u226518 years (31 measurements), bias, precision, and accuracy of all 3 equations is shown in the Table. Bias tended to be less for measurements taken while on losartan; however this was not a significant difference for any eGFR equation. For the 1 subject <18 years (2 measurements), the modified Schwartz formula had less bias than the CKiD formula (12.4 vs. 83.7 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ). Table 1.  . Bias - ml/min/1.73 m 2 (95% CI) .

Equation 3 which incorporated SCr had the greatest positive bias. Cystatin C correlates with GFR in SCD, and is elevated more frequently in stage 2 CKD, thus it remains an important marker of renal impairment in this population. As direct GFR measurement is not practical in the general clinical setting, further studies are needed to develop eGFR equations with improved accuracy for the SCD population. Disclosures Off Label Use: Losartan was given to patients for treatment of sickle cell nephropathy, defined as albuminuria with albumin/creatinine ratio >30 mg/g. Losartan is FDA approved for diabetic nephropathy and hypertension, but has no indications for sickle nephropathy."
