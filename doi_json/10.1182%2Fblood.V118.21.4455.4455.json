    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4455 Introduction: The CML Registry was developed by the Argentine Society of Hematology as a part of the centralized RAEH. Results from epidemiologic and clinical data related to CML, will enable to determine the geographic distribution of the target population, to establish associated environmental causes, and mainly to rationalize resources supply. Objective: a) To analyze characteristics of CML patients registered in the RAEH; b) To evaluate the CML Registry performance through its first year. Materials and Methods: Patients with CML registered in the RAEH from January 1 st , 2011 up to July 31 st , 2011. The protocol allowed to enroll de novo patients as well as patients diagnosed from 2000 on. Result: Data reported by 15 hospitals were included: 224 patients were registered. Mean age was 50 (18\u201386 y) and gender distribution was female: 102, male: 122. Occupational data showed no a characteristic pattern. 96.5% of patients were diagnosed in chronic phase, while 3.5% were diagnosed in accelerated phase/blast crisis. In 6% of patients cytogenetic tests detected 8 abnormalities besides t(9,22): double Philadelphia chromosome and monosomy 12 were the most frequent findings. FISH tests were recorded for 18% of patients at the time of diagnosis. Bone marrow biopsy was reported as a diagnostic procedure in 51%. Qualitative BCR/ABL was recorded for 31% of patients at the time of diagnosis. Molecular RQ-PCR tests for follow-up of treatment response were reported for 51% of patients. Of the registered population, 21% received interferon as previous therapy to Imatinib (IM); 89% received IM 400mg daily; 6% required dose increase. Second line treatment with dasatinib or nilotinib was recorded in 34% and 14% of patients, respectively. At 60 months mean follow-up 8% of the registered population had developed blast crisis and 6% had died. Conclusions. The RAEH\u2019s first year of performance in CML was assessed. This only reflects the experience with 15 sites. Data registered will allow us in the following years to learn about disease epidemiology and available resources to improve patient accessibility.
