    "abstract_text": "Introduction. Interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) is an attractive agent for the treatment of Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) due to its ability to induce clonal complete remission, sometimes lasting beyond treatment discontinuation, and to its recognized non-leukemogenicity. However, despite decades of clinical experience with IFN-\u03b1 in patients with MPNs, optimal dose schedules, treatment duration and the ultimate molecular basis of the heterogeneous response still remain undefined. Hence, the early identification of IFN-sensitive patients may help limit IFN-\u03b1 exposure to those who really benefit from treatment. Aim. Here we report the results of a trial involving 61 ET patients treated with IFN-\u03b1, aimed to identify the baseline molecular and clinical parameters able to predict response to treatment. Methods. IFN treatment schedule implied an initial induction phase with 3MU/five times a week; in patients who reached a platelet count <400x10 9 /L, IFN dose density was progressively reduced and patients considered Good-responders (Good-R). Patients who failed to achieve platelet normalization after induction, underwent an additional three-month period of IFN treatment at 3MU/five times a week. In case platelet count was still >600x10 9 /L or platelet reduction was <50% the baseline level, the patient was considered resistant to the IFN therapy (Bad-R). Careful medical history, main laboratory data and spleen volume, assessed by ultrasonography scan were recorded in all patients at presentation and during follow-up. Complete hematological response (CHR) is defined as the normalization of both platelet and WBC counts (<400x10 9 /L and <10x10 9 /L, respectively) and the absence of disease-related symptoms. mRNA levels of JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, STAT3, SOCS1, SOCS3 and TYK2 were assayed in pre-treatment bone marrow specimens by Real-Time PCR using the SYBR Green method. Results. After a median follow-up of 41.2 months, 72% of patients achieved CHR and were considered Good-Rs for subsequent analysis, whereas the remaining 17 were considered Bad-Rs. Among the Good-Rs, 24 (54%) are still on therapy with standard IFN-\u03b1 doses (i.e. 3 MU 3 or 2 times a week), whereas 10 (23%) are maintained in CHR by the administration of very low doses of IFN-\u03b1-2b (3 MU every 7 or 15 days), and 3 (7%) have maintained CHR after therapy discontinuation (up to a median time of 31 months). The initial univariate analysis indicated that the mRNA levels of JAK1, STAT3, SOCS3 were significantly lower in Good-R than in Bad-R patients. Interestingly, among the different genes involved in the IFN-\u03b1 receptor pathway, the expression levels of JAK1, together with spleen volume and platelet count, were selected by the stepwise multivariate analysis as the variables that independently correlate with IFN-\u03b1 response. We used the relative HRs and the optimal cut-offs for response calculated for each variable by the ROC analysis to develop a prognostic score able to predict IFN-\u03b1 response. This score has an overall 87% diagnostic efficiency in discriminating IFN-\u03b1 response and unambiguously identifies the response to IFN-\u03b1 in most patients, avoiding treatment in those with no probability of gaining benefit from this therapy. In addition, this score is able to identify unambiguously the response to IFN in a sizeable proportion of patients: an IFN-R score of 3 or 4 (31 patients, corresponding to 70.4% of the Good-R) indicates a 100% odd to obtain CHR, while a score of 0 indicates no chance of achieving a response. Conclusion. In conclusion, this study shows for the first time that the use of three simples parameters predicts the response to IFN in ET patients.
