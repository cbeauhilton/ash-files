    "abstract_text": "Introduction Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are generated from progenitors that have aberrantly activated self-renewal pathways thereby resulting in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance. The telomerase complex, consisting of a reverse transcriptase subunit (TERT), an RNA template subunit (TERC), and a protective shelterin scaffold, transcriptionally modulates the Wnt/b-catenin self-renewal pathway. Many malignancies, including BCR-ABL TKI resistant blast crisis CML (BC CML), exhibit robust telomerase activity thereby prompting the development of imetelstat, a competitive inhibitor of telomerase enzymatic activity. Imetelstat is a covalently lipidated 13-mer oligonucleotide that binds with high affinity to the TERC subunit. Recent clinical trials showed early signs of efficacy in myeloproliferative neoplasms. However, the role of imetelstat in selective self-renewing LSC inhibition in CML had not been elucidated. Thus, we performed progenitor RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), stromal co-cultures and humanized LSC primagraft studies to investigate the capacity of imetelstat to selectively inhibit LSC self-renewal and to determine the mechanism of action. Methods and Results Cytoscape analysis of RNA-seq data derived from FACS-purified progenitors from human blast crisis (BC; n=9) compared with chronic phase (CP; n=8) CML and primary normal (n=6) samples revealed transcriptional upregulation of b-catenin, LEF1, TCF7L1, ABL1 and other key genes within the TERT interactome suggesting a role for TERT activation in human BC LSC generation. Human progenitor LSC-supportive SL/M2 stromal co-culture experiments revealed that combined treatment with a potent BCR-ABL TKI, dasatinib at 1 nM, and imetelstat at 1 or 5 mM significantly inhibited (p<0.001, ANOVA) in vitro self-renewal of BC CML (n=5) compared with age-matched normal bone marrow progenitors. Treatment of primagraft mouse models of human BC CML with 30 mg/kg of imetelstat three times a week for four weeks resulted in a significant reduction in bone marrow progenitor LSC burden compared with mismatch treated controls (p=0.04). Furthermore, qRT-PCR showed decreased \u03b2-catenin transcript levels in imetelstat compared with vehicle-treated samples. Finally, FACS analysis revealed a significant reduction in activated b-catenin protein levels in engrafted human myeloid progenitors following imetelstat treatment in the TKI resistant bone marrow niche. Conclusions Niche responsive interactions between the telomerase complex and the Wnt/b-catenin self-renewal pathway sensitize b-catenin activated LSC to imetelstat in both in vitro and in vivo humanized pre-clinical BC CML models thereby providing a strong rationale for LSC eradication trials involving imetelstat.
