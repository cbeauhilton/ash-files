    "abstract_text": "Recombinant erythropoietin (Epo) is an effective anti-anemic agent in most cancer patients and improves their quality of life. Yet, concerns of disease progression and reduced survival in recombinant human Epo (rhuEpo)-treated patients have been raised by Phase III clinical trial data showing more rapid cancer progression and reduced survival in subjects randomized to Epo. Epo has pleiotropic actions and its receptor, EpoR, is expressed by many different cell types outside the erythroid compartment. It was thus proposed that a major possible mechanism for this potentially harmful effect of Epo in cancer patients is the activation of EpoRs on cancer cells. The original clinical studies have been criticized because they deployed polyclonal antibodies later shown to lack specificity for EpoR. Furthermore, multiple isoforms of EpoR caused by differential splicing have been reported, but only at the RNA level, in different cancer cell lines. Investigations into whether these spliced versions actually result in abnormal EpoR forms at the protein level, alter Epo responsiveness and have an impact on tumor progression in vivo , have been hampered by a lack of well characterized monoclonal antibodies. The \u2018EpoCan\u2019 Consortium, funded by the EU, is directed to promote improved pathological testing of EpoR in patient samples, leading to safer clinical use of rHuEpo and other Erythropoietic Stimulating Agents (ESAs). To date, 25 murine and rat monoclonal antibodies have been produced against the EpoR, using novel genetic and traditional peptide immunization protocols. Of these antibodies, several were found to specifically recognize the receptor in various assays including Western blot (WB), immunoprecipitation (IP), immunofluorescence (IF), flow cytometry (FACS) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Table 1 lists the antibodies that were selected for further analysis, and their experimental applications. The antibodies were tested on EpoR transfected cells (HEK 293 cells and COS cells) and Epo-dependent UT7 cells which endogenously express EpoR. In addition the antibodies were tested on non-erythroid cells viz. the non-small cell lung carcinoma A549, and breast cancer MDA-MB 231 cell lines. Specificity of the antibodies towards the EpoR in these two latter cell lines was ensured by the lack of reactivity with the corresponding EpoR silenced cells.

Two rat monoclonal antibodies, BCO-3H2-D3 which recognizes full length EpoR and BCO-4B5-C9 which recognizes full length and truncated isoforms, have proved valuable in comparative immunohistochemical and Western blot studies in a range of human tumors and cell lines. These well characterized monoclonal antibodies will enable a careful dissection of EpoR function in cancer cells and the detection of EpoR isoforms in tumor tissue. In the longer term such studies should allow clinicians to balance the benefits and risks of ESA treatment in cancer.
