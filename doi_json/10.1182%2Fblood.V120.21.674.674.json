    "abstract_text": "Abstract 674 Background. Activating mutations in FLT3 occur in \u223c30% of adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases, including internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations (\u223c25%) and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (KD), primarily at the activation loop (AL) residue D835 (\u223c5%). FLT3-ITD and FLT3-AL mutations can co-occur in individual patients. AC220 (quizartinib) is a potent selective investigational FLT3/KIT inhibitor with encouraging preliminary clinical activity in FLT3-ITD+ AML, as evidenced by a composite complete remission rate of 45% in 53 chemotherapy refractory/relapsed patients in an interim analysis of a phase II study (Cortes et al, ASH 2011 abstract #614). While some patients without FLT3 mutations in the AC220 phase I dose escalation study responded, no objective response was observed in a small number of FLT3-AL mutant patients (Cortes et al, ASH 2008 abstract #767). We recently reported that secondary mutations at F691, D835 and Y842 in FLT3-ITD confer in vitro resistance to AC220, and that relapse in 8/8 AML patients who initially responded to AC220 was associated with evolution of secondary KD mutations in the FLT3-ITD+ allele (Smith et al., Nature, 2012). In 6 of 8 patients, relapse was associated with D835 substitutions, making this amino acid position the most commonly substituted residue in FLT3-ITD+ patients at the time of disease relapse. Given that D835 mutations in FLT3-ITD appear to confer a high degree of pre-clinical and clinical resistance to AC220, we hypothesized that D835 mutations in the absence of the ITD might also confer resistance to AC220 and could be associated with clinical relapse, especially in patients harboring a mixture of FLT3-WT, FLT3-ITD+, and FLT3-AL mutant blasts. Results. In vitro binding studies revealed that FLT3-D835V and FLT3-D835Y have decreased affinity for AC220 (Kd=4.8 and 7nM, respectively) compared to native FLT3 (Kd=1.8nM). In proliferation assays of BaF/3 cells, FLT3-D835V/Y mutants demonstrated increased relative AC220 resistance (IC50 24 and 6.8nM) compared to FLT3-ITD (IC50 0.13nM). To sensitively and precisely determine the frequency and phase (ITD+ vs ITD-) of mutations in clinical isolates, we utilized single molecule real-time (SMRT; Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA) sequencing, which can generate reads of sufficient length to enable focused interrogation of the KD of FLT3 ITD+ and ITD- alleles. We analyzed ITD- sequences from pretreatment and relapse samples obtained from the 8 FLT3-ITD -positive AML patients with acquired AC220 resistance reported in our previous analysis. Interestingly, all 6 patients with secondary mutations at D835 in ITD+ alleles at relapse also harbored D835 mutant ITD- alleles. All D835 mutations detected in ITD- alleles were also observed in ITD+ alleles from the same patient sample. In ITD+ alleles, we detected D835Y (n=6), D835V (n=3), and D835F (n=2) (range 2.7\u201350.6% of ITD+ alleles). In ITD- alleles, we found D835Y (n=6), D835V (n=2), and D835F (n=1) (range 3.8\u201350% of ITD- alleles). One patient had 2 D835 mutations (D835Y/F) in ITD- alleles at relapse. Although 2 of 8 patients evolved the F691L mutation in ITD+ alleles at relapse, this substitution was not detectable in ITD- sequences in any patient. In 7/8 patients, samples obtained immediately prior to AC220 administration were available for analysis. We were unable to document the presence of AC220-resistant mutations in either ITD+ or ITD- sequences in these pretreatment samples, suggesting that these mutants evolved under the selective pressure of AC220 treatment. We are currently performing single cell RT-PCR to determine if D835 mutations in ITD+ and ITD- alleles occur in distinct leukemic cells, which would suggest a polyclonal blast population at relapse. Conclusions. FLT3-AL mutations at D835 confer resistance to AC220 in vitro. The evolution of D835 substitutions in ITD- alleles in the majority of patients who respond and relapse on AC220 suggests that constitutively activating FLT3-AL mutations at residue D835 can confer acquired clinical resistance to AC220. AML patients with FLT3-D835 mutations may exhibit de novo resistance to AC220 and other FLT3 inhibitors. Our findings predict that the clinical activity of potent FLT3 inhibitors that are tolerant of D835 substitutions will mechanistically involve inhibition of D835 mutants in both the presence and absence of an ITD mutation.
