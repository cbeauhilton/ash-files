    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1449 Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in combination with plerixafor (AMD3100) produces significant mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells in the rhesus macaque model. The CD34+ cell population mobilized possesses a unique gene expression profile, suggesting a different proportion of progenitor/stem cells. To evaluate whether these CD34+ cells can stably reconstitute blood cells, we performed hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using G-CSF and plerixafor-mobilized rhesus CD34+ cells that were transduced with chimeric HIV1-based lentiviral vector including the SIV-capsid (\u03c7HIV vector). In our experiments, G-CSF and plerixafor mobilization (N=3) yielded a 2-fold higher CD34+ cell number, compared to that observed for G-CSF and stem cell factor (SCF) combination (N=5) (8.6 \u00b1 1.8 \u00d7 10 7 vs. 3.6 \u00b1 0.5 \u00d7 10 7 , p<0.01). Transduction rates with \u03c7HIV vector, however, were 4-fold lower in G-CSF and plerixafor-mobilized CD34+ cells, compared to G-CSF and SCF (13 \u00b1 4% vs. 57 \u00b1 5%, p<0.01). CD123+ (IL3 receptor) rates were higher in CD34+ cells mobilized by G-CSF and plerixafor (16.4%) or plerixafor alone (21.3%), when compared to G-CSF alone (2.6%). To determine their repopulating ability, G-CSF and plerixafor-mobilized CD34+ cells were transduced with EGFP-expressing \u03c7HIV vector at MOI 50 and transplanted into lethally-irradiated rhesus macaques (N=3). Blood counts and transgene expression levels were followed for more than one year. Animals transplanted with G-CSF and plerixafor-mobilized cells showed engraftment of all lineages and earlier recovery of lymphocytes, compared to animals who received G-CSF and SCF-mobilized grafts (1200 \u00b1 300/\u03bcl vs. 3300 \u00b1 900/\u03bcl on day 30, p<0.05). One month after transplantation, there was a transient development of a skin rash, cold agglutinin reaction, and IgG and IgM type plasma paraproteins in one of the three animals transplanted with G-CSF and plerixafor cells. This animal had the most rapid lymphocyte recovery. These data suggested that G-CSF and plerixafor-mobilized CD34+ cells contained an increased amount of early lymphoid progenitor cells, compared to those arising from the G-CSF and SCF mobilization. One year after transplantation, transgene expression levels were 2\u20135% in the first animal, 2\u20135% in the second animal, and 5\u201310% in the third animal in all lineage cells. These data indicated G-CSF and plerixafor-mobilized CD34+ cells could stably reconstitute peripheral blood in the rhesus macaque. Next, we evaluated the correlation of transgene expression levels between in vitro bulk CD34+ cells and lymphocytes at one month, three months, and six months post-transplantation. At one and three months after transplantation, data from G-CSF and plerixafor mobilization showed higher ratio of %EGFP in lymphocytes to that of in vitro CD34+ cells when compared to that of G-CSF and SCF mobilization. At six months after transplantation the ratios were similar. These results again suggest that G-CSF and plerixafor-mobilized CD34+ cells might include a larger proportion of early lymphoid progenitor cells when compared to G-CSF and SCF mobilization. In summary, G-CSF and plerixafor mobilization increased CD34+ cell numbers. G-CSF and plerixafor-mobilized CD34+ cells contained an increased number of lymphoid progenitor cells and a hematopoietic stem cell population that was capable of reconstituting blood cells as demonstrated by earlier lymphoid recovery and stable multilineage transgene expression in vivo , respectively. Our findings should impact the development of new clinical mobilization protocols. View large Download slide View large Download slide  Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
