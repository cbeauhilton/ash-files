    "abstract_text": "Objective : Myeloma bone disease (MBD) is the most common complication of multiple myeloma (MM). We found that the serum levels of C3/C4 in MM patients were significantly positive correlated with the severity of bone disease in our previously study. Thus, we conduct detailed studies to explore the effect and potential mechanism of C3a/C4a on osteoclasts in patients with MM. Methods : By adding C3a/C4a to culture system of osteoclasts induced from mononuclear cells in vitro, and the expression of related gene, number and function of osteoclasts were detected. RNA-Seq analysis was used to detect the differentially expressed genes on osteoclasts between the complement group and control group, and the possible signal pathways were analyzed. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blot and pathway inhibitors were used for further validation. R esults: In vitro, the osteoclasts area per view induced by C3a 1\u03bcg/ml (52.794\u00b113.027 %) and 10\u03bcg/ml (51.797\u00b112.464 %) was significantly increased than control group (0\u03bcg/ml) (33.668\u00b18.427 %) (P<0.001; P<0.001), the mRNA relative expression of osteoclasts related genes OSCAR/TRAP/RANKL/Cathepsin K induced by C3a 1\u03bcg/ml (median 5.041; 3.726; 1.638; 4.752) and 10\u03bcg/ml (median 5.140; 3.702; 2.250; 5.172) was significantly increased than control group (0\u03bcg/ml) (median 3.137; 2.004; 0.573; 2.257) (1\u03bcg/ml P=0.001; P=0.003; P<0.001; P=0.008; 1\u03bcg/ml P<0.001; P=0.019; P<0.001; P=0.002), and the absorption area of osteoclast resorption pit per view induced by C3a 1\u03bcg/ml (51.464\u00b111.983 %) and 10\u03bcg/ml (50.219\u00b112.067 %) was also significantly increased than control group (0\u03bcg/ml) (33.845\u00b18.331 %) (P<0.001; P<0.001) in NDMM patients. There was no difference among the osteoclasts area, relative expression of osteoclasts related genes and absorption area of osteoclast resorption pit between C4a (1\u03bcg/ml and 10\u03bcg/ml) group and control group (0\u03bcg/ml). RNA-Seq was performed on total RNA of osteoclasts induced by C3a in 1\u03bcg/ml group and 0\u03bcg/ml group of 4 patients with NDMM. There were 184 differentially expressed genes that were detected by RNA-Seq analysis. KEGG Pathway enrichment bubble chart shows C3a may through Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways (including PI3K-Akt pathway and AKT-independent signaling pathway) promotes the proliferation of osteoclast. Upregulated differentially expressed genes in this pathway among at least 3 patients with sequencing were validated by qRT-PCR and Western Blot. It was found that the relative expression level of Phosphoinositide dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) / Serum and glucocorticoid inducible protein kinases (SGK3) genes (median 2.078; 4.428) in C3a group (1\u03bcg/ml) was significantly higher than control group (0\u03bcg/ml) (median 1.336; 1.714) (P<0.001; P=0.001). The relative grayscale levels of PDK1/ P-SGK3 protein (1.785\u00b10.323; 2.190\u00b10.274) in C3a group (1\u03bcg/ml) was significantly stronger than control group (0\u03bcg/ml) (0.8653\u00b10.588; 0.176\u00b10.152) (P=0.034; P<0.001). Under the action of C3a in patients with NDMM, osteoclasts area per view in SGK inhibitor (EMD638683) 1\u03bcM group (39.244\u00b19.089 %) and 10\u03bcM group (39.299\u00b19.587 %) significantly reduced than control group (0\u03bcM) (54.884\u00b112.837 %) (P<0.001; P<0.001), the relative expression of osteoclast related genes OSCAR/RANKL/TRAP/Cathepsin K in EMD638683 1\u03bcM group (median 0.869; 1.097; 0.902; 1.328) and 10\u03bcM group (median 0.703; 1.391; 0.843; 1.418) significantly decreased than control group (0\u03bcM) (median 2.270; 3.024; 2.208; 3.237) (1\u03bcM P=0.015; P=0.002; P=0.003; P=0.015; 10\u03bcM P=0.012; P=0.006; P<0.001; P=0.017), and the absorption area per view of osteoclast resorption pit in EMD638683 1\u03bcM (35.383\u00b17.794 %) group and 10\u03bcM group (32.886\u00b18.993 %) significantly reduced than control group (0\u03bcM) (49.358\u00b111.856 %) (P < 0.001; P < 0.001). Conclusions: ComplementC3a activates osteoclasts by regulating the PI3K/PDK1/SGK3 pathway in patients with MM, thus leading to the occurrence of bone diseases. SGK inhibitor has a significant inhibitory effect on osteoclasts in patients with MM. This study provide important evidences for the search for new therapeutic targets and strategies for myeloma bone disease patients.
