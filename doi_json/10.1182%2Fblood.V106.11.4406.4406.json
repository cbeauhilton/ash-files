    "abstract_text": "Objective: The previous studies of our research group have proved that specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTLs) can be generated from umbilical cord cells. The purpose of this study is to further demonstrate whether CD8 + CTLs can be generated from cord blood (CB) and kill leukemia cells specifically ex vivo. And whether the leukemia cytotoxicity of CD8 + CTLs and CD8 \u2212 CTLs are different. Method: First we induce adherent cells collecting from CB samples to generate dendritic cells (DCs) by culturing with GM-CSF, IL-4 and load lysate antigen of U937 cell to immature DCs. On day 6 th , TNF-\u03b1and PGE 2 was added to accelerate the maturation of DCs. After co-culturing DCs with the CTLs from the same CB, then we used MidiMACS to isolate CD8 + and CD8 \u2212 T cell. The cytotoxicity of the CD8 + CTLs and CD8 \u2212\u2212 CTLs to U937 cell line was evaluated with Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium(MTT) assay. Result: The purity of CD8 + CTL was(95.73\u00b11.50)%. Among the CD8 \u2212 CTLs, the percentage of CD4 + CTLs was (65.01\u00b19.29)% and CD8 + T lymphocytes was (4.9\u00b14.46)%. When E:T ratios were 40:1, 20:1 and 10:1, the mean cytotoxic rate (MCR)of CD8 + CTLs to U937 cell were (66.36\u00b112.43)%,(35.38\u00b19.64)% and(19.04\u00b16.15)% respectively; the MCR of CD8 \u2212 CTLs to U937 cell were (34.47\u00b18.19)%,(21.85\u00b17.06)% and(12.26\u00b14.87)% and the MCR of T cell from CB to U937 cell were(15.79\u00b14.64)%,(9.6\u00b13.71)% and (5.69\u00b13.14)%. The MCR of CD8 + CTLs to U937 cell were significant higher than those of CD8 \u2212 CTLs and T cell groups at the same E:T ratios(P<0.05). When E:T ratios was 40:1,the MCR of CD8 + CTLs and CD8 \u2212 CTLs to K562 cell line were (36.77\u00b110.24)% and (26.95\u00b13.06)% respectively, the cytotoxicity effect of CD8 + and CD8 \u2212 CTLs to K562 cell are no difference (P>0.05). Conclusions: The cytotoxicity of CD8 + CTLs against U937 cell lines is more potent than that of CD8 \u2212 CTLs, and this effect is specific.",
