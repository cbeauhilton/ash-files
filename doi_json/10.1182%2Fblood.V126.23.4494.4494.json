    "abstract_text": "Healthcare disparities, such as race/ethnicity and SES, can impact access to care and outcomes in cancer patients. ASCT is standard therapy for high-risk relapsed and refractory lymphoma, but is a highly specialized and resource-intensive procedure. The association of race and SES with outcomes in lymphoma patients undergoing ASCT has not been described previously. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 687 consecutive ASCT recipients with Hodgkins (N=154, 22%) and non-Hodgkins (N=533, 78%) lymphoma transplanted between 2003 and 2013 at our institution. Zip code of residence was used to obtain median annual household income based on 2010 US Census data. Patients were categorized into low SES (1/KPS 1 year, however, mortality in the low SES group in primarily mediated through non-relapse causes. Our study highlights the need for active interventions to mitigate health care disparities in this high risk population. Table. 5-year outcomes after ASCT for lymphoma by SES Outcomes .
