    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Pediatric Cancer patients are treated with therapeutic research protocols that detail medical treatment in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Unfortunately, there is no precise definition of a structured nursing care plan that is mandatory to enhance the quality of care needed for these patients. Our study aimed to examine the impact of implementing a designed nursing care guidelines (NCG) on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patient outcomes during the induction phase concerning; incidence, duration, and intensity of the patient's gastrointestinal tract GIT adverse events. Methods: A Quasi-experimental research design was utilized in this study with posttest only control group conducted at the Hematology Units of Children Cancer Hospital Egypt 57357. Seventy-four oncology nurses received adequate education for the designed nursing care plan. A total of (132) ALL children in induction phase were enrolled in the study and were divided into two groups: group 1 (intervention group) was implemented the nursing care guidelines and group II (control group) who was left to the routine hospital care. Tools: data collection instruments included; \"patient outcomes audit chart\" to assess the GIT adverse - events data: the incidence, duration, and intensity. The intensity grading of the adverse events Adopted from the NCI (National Cancer Institute) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE) Published on May 28, 2009. Results: A significant positive correlation between implementing the NCG and GIT adverse events incidence, duration and severity were observed (Figure 1). Incidence was reported higher in the control group than the study group with a mean score of \u00b1SD (2.48\u00b1 .949) versus (0.67\u00b1 0.751) respectively, and a p-value (P<0.0001). The duration of incidence was (15.32\u00b1 5.920) versus (3.70\u00b1 5.108) in the intervention group (t =12.074) df (130) and a p-value (P<0.0001). The intensity grading of the adverse events was less in the study group than the control. (figure 2) Mean scores for nurses' post-NCG knowledge in the study group were significantly higher than the nurse's knowledge scores in the control group. The intensity of incidence revealed that a significantly higher on the intervention group. Conclusion: Designing and implementing NCG for all treatment protocols is essential for the enhancement of patients' outcomes. Developing a pediatric oncology nurse residency program for education and teaching of the required practical skills in LMIC is mandatory.
