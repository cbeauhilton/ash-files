    "abstract_text": "Currently there is no method available to predict response to farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTI). We analyzed gene expression profiles from the bone marrow of patients from a phase 2 study of the FTI tipifarnib (R115777, ZARNESTRA), in older adults with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The RASGRP1:APTX gene expression ratio was found to predict response to tipifarnib with the greatest accuracy. This two-gene ratio was validated by quantitative PCR in the newly diagnosed AML cohort. We further demonstrated that this classifier could predict response to tipifarnib in an independent set of 54 samples from relapsed or refractory AML, with a negative predictive value and positive predictive value of 92% and 28%, respectively (odds ratio of 4.4). The classifier also predicted for improved overall survival (154 vs 56 days, p = 0.0001), which was shown to be independent of other prognostic factors including a previously described gene expression classifier predictive of prognosis. Therefore, these data indicate that a two-gene expression assay may have utility in categorizing a population of AML patients who are more likely to respond to tipifarnib."
