    "abstract_text": "Background Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication in ambulatory patients with cancer initiating systemic chemotherapy. Central venous catheters (CVCs) used for chemotherapy administration are associated with a heightened risk of VTE in this patient population. Primary thromboprophylaxis using a direct oral anticoagulant decreases the risk of VTE without significantly increasing the risk of major bleeding complications in ambulatory cancer patients at intermediate-to-high risk of VTE with a Khorana risk score of \u2265 2. We sought to determine the efficacy and safety of apixaban in intermediate-to-high risk patients with cancer and a CVC. Methods This post-hoc analysis was done using the AVERT trial data, which was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of apixaban for primary thromboprophylaxis in intermediate-to-high risk patients with cancer initiating chemotherapy. The primary efficacy outcome was major VTE within 180 days of randomization and the primary safety outcome was major bleeding. The hazard ratios (HRs) for the primary efficacy and safety outcomes in patients with and without CVC were calculated using a Cox regression model controlling for age, gender, and study center. Results A total of 217 patients were included in the subgroup analyses with 126 and 91 patients receiving apixaban or placebo, respectively. The baseline characteristics are depicted in Table 1. Major VTE occurred in 6 (4.8%) patients in the apixaban group and 17 (18.7%) patients in the placebo group (HR 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14-0.47; p<0.0001). Major bleeding occurred in 2 (1.6%) patients in the apixaban group and 2 (2.2%) patients in the placebo group (HR 0.69; 95% CI, 0.20-2.35; p=0.556). Conclusions Primary thromboprophylaxis with apixaban in patients with cancer and a CVC seems to reduce the risk of VTE without increasing the risk of major bleeding. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings.
