    "abstract_text": "The regulation of cell cycle activity, differentiation and self-renewal of stem cells are dependent on accurate processing of intrinsic and extrinsic signals. Traditionally, signaling pathway activation has been detected by immunobloting using phospho-specific antibodies. However, detection of signal transduction in rare cells within heterogeneous populations, such as hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSC) has been difficult to achieve. In a recently reported approach to visualize signaling in selected single c-Kit + Sca-1 + Lin \u2212 (KSL) bone marrow cells, cells were sorted onto glas slides by flow cytometry and signaling was detected by confocal fluorescence microscopy, a very time consuming method that thus restricts the number of cells that can be analysed simultaneously. Moreover it permits only qualitative, but not quantitative signaling evaluation (Yamazaki et al., EMBO J. 2006). Here, we report a new protocol allowing quantitative measurement of signaling activity in large numbers of defined murine and human hematopoietic cells. The cells are stained with established surface markers and then phospho-specific antibodies are used to detect the levels of active intracellular signaling molecules. Signals are quantified by flow cytometry fluorescence measurement. Importantly, the protocol developed in our laboratory enables preservation of surface marker staining identifying the cells of interest inspite the fixation and permeabilization procedures necessary for intracellular signaling detection. This applies also for antigens previously reported to be particularly vulnerable to standard fixation and permeabilization approaches (e.g. the murine stem cell markers c-Kit and Sca1). Thus, our protocol provides an easy and reliable method for quantifying the activation degree of several intracellular signaling pathways on single cell level in defined hematopoietic (stem) cells within the heterogeous bone marrow (BM) compartment. Using cytokines known to exert a biological effect on HSCs, we have examined the susceptibility of KSL murine BM cells and human BM CD34 + cells to cytokine-induced signaling. We have performed extensive dosage titration and time course analysis for multiple cytokines (SCF, TPO, Flt-3, IL-3, IL-6, Ang-1, SDF-1\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2, and BMP-4) and signaling pathways (ERK, Akt, p38MAPK, Jak-Stat, TGF-\u03b2/BMP-Smad) in murine KSL BM cells. The activation intensity and the duration of signal activity as measured by the expression of corresponding phosphorylated proteins were cytokine specific. The obtained results can be used as a platform to explore signaling alterations in distinct compartments of the hematopoietic system, and may provide mechanistical insights for observed bone marrow defects (e.g impaired ERK signaling pathway has been detected as a possible cause of hematopoietic defects in Caspase-3 mutant murine HSCs, Janzen et al, Cell Stem Cell 2008). Furthermore, we could show that the technique is also applicable to human BM cells and that the human hematopoietic stem cell marker CD34 is also preserved by our fixation and permeabilization protocol. Preliminary results suggest that cytokines induce similar signaling activation in human CD34 + BM cells collected from healthy donors. As observed in mouse KSL BM cells, stimulation of human CD34 + cells with human stem cell factor (hSCF) induced activation of the ERK but not the Akt pathway. Ongoing experiments analyse the stimulatory effects of other cytokines such as thrombopoietin (TPO) and fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt-3) and their corresponding pathways. Moreover, comparative studies are underway analyzing cross-reactivity between mouse and human cytokines, aiming to provide insights into cytokine-induced biases in commonly used xenotransplantation models."
