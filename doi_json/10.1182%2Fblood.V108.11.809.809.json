    "abstract_text": "Low stage DLBCL patients have better prognosis than those with advanced disease. We searched for differences in gene expression between disease stages to find correlations with tumor stage as possible therapeutic targets. We used 2 microarray datasets from the Leukemia/Lymphoma Molecular Profiling Project containing nodal and extra-nodal de novo DLBCL samples on Lymphochip (LC), spotted arrays of ~7400 and Affymetrix arrays (Affy) of ~45,000 elements. The Affy dataset was a subset of the LC samples. LC elements were median-centered, log 2 transformed; Affy elements were array-centered to a 500 average. We compared average gene expression in stage I vs. III/IV, looking for elements with >2-fold differences between low and high stage, with p3-fold. A subset of these genes, CTGF (connective tissue growth factor), FN1 (fibronectin), INHBA (activin), POSTN (periostin), THBS1 (thrombospondin), and BCL2, are coregulated and/or coregulatory. Many are expressed in the microenvironment and associated with fibrosis, wound healing and Th2 immune response. The presence of these genes at higher levels and their known associations implied a pathway of TGF-\u03b2 signaling present mainly in the low stage DLBCL. Although TGF-\u03b2 levels were not different between stages, differences in localization/activation of TGF-\u03b2 could account for observed differences. In conclusion, there are a small number of stage-specific gene expression differences in DLBCL, and many of these relate to TGF-\u03b2 signaling in the microenvironment. CTGF and FN1 were previously identified as key prognostic molecules in DLBCL (Rosenwald et al, NEJM 2002). These differences may relate to different prognoses between DLBCL stages and constitute therapeutic targets. Genes Differentially Expressed by Stage  higher in stage I . . higher in stage III/IV . .
