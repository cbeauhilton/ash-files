    "abstract_text": "Background : The phase 3 OPTIMISMM\uff08NCT01734928\uff09 trial done at 133 hospitals and research centres in 21 countries but no Chinese site involved in this study. In the OPTIMISMM study ,pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (PVd) demonstrated excellent ef\ufb01cacy in patients at \ufb01rst relapse, including immediately after upfront lenalidomide treatment failure and other common \ufb01rst-line treatments, the mPFS was 20.73 months, the ORR was 90.1%, and no new safety signals were observed. Building on these promising results, we decided to explore PVd in Chinese patients at \ufb01rst relapse. Study Design/Methods: This is a multicenter, prospective, single-arm phase 2 study designed to evaluate the ef\ufb01cacy and safety of PVd in Chinese patients at \ufb01rst relapse. Eligible patients were aged \u226518 years and had a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, measurable disease, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Patients were required to have had only 1 prior antimyeloma regimen. Key exclusion criteria included creatinine clearance<30 mL/min requiring dialysis, grade \u22653 peripheral neuropathy, or grade 2 peripheral neuropathy with pain. Patients with prior exposure to bortezomib were eligible, provided they were not refractory to a bortezomib-containing regimen dosed at 1.3 mg/m 2 twice weekly. Patient\uff08n=62,Figure 1\uff09will receive pomalidomide 4 mg on days 1-14 of each cycle. Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m 2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of cycles 1-8 and on days 1 and 8 of cycles 9 and beyond. Dexamethasone was given on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of cycles 1-8 and on days 1, 2, 8, and 9 of cycles 9 and beyond; patients received 20 mg of dexamethasone if aged \u226475 years and 10 mg otherwise. The primary endpoint is ORR, the secondary endpoints are\u2265VGPR, MRD(-) rate, PFS, OS and safety. ORR will be assessed by the International Myeloma Working Group criteria after each cycle until PD. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate PFS and OS. Safety analysis will be conducted in the safety population, which are composed of all patients who received \u22651 dose of study medication. The trial is currently enrolling and will be open in 7 sites of China. Disclosures: Research Sponsor: CHIATAI TIANQING PHARMACEUTICAL GROUP.
