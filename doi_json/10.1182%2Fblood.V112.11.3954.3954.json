    "abstract_text": "Background. Understanding the causes of failure in older patients with ALL may help improve treatment strategies for this age group. Study Aims. To define the causes of death in older (age \u226560 years) patients with ALL during induction and consolidation-maintenance with the dose intensive Hyper-CVAD regimen, and compare their outcome to those of older patients treated previously with less intensive regimens, and to those of younger patients treated with Hyper-CVAD. Study Groups. 122 older patients treated with Hyper-CVAD were compared with 34 older patients treated with less intensive regimens, and 409 younger patients treated with Hyper-CVAD. Results. The outcome in older patients on Hyper-CVAD, older patients on other regimens, and younger patients on Hyper-CVAD are shown in the Table. Conclusion. Intensifying the chemotherapy in older patients with ALL reduced the incidence of leukemia resistance but increased the incidence of death in CR from myelosuppression-associated infections. The overall benefit: risk was favorable. Identifying novel low-intensity agents/regimens for older patients with ALL may improve the results.  Parameter . Older; Hyper CVAD . Older; Other .
