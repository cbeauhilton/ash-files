    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4064 HM1.24, an immunological target highly expressed on majority of multiple myeloma (MM) cells, has not been effectively targeted with therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Recently, XmAb5592, a novel Fc-domain engineered humanized anti-HM1.24 mAb with specific Fc-domain modification, was shown to induce >10-fold antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis against MM cells, when compared with the humanized normal anti-HM1.24 IgG 1 (XmAb5627) from which it is derived (ASH Abstract#609, 2009). Here we investigated whether XmAb5592, when combined with other anti-MM drugs, further enhanced ADCC against MM cell lines and primary patient MM cells using Calcein-AM release ADCC assays and flow cytometric analysis for cell membrane CD107a to specifically quantitate NK cell (CD56+CD3-) activation. Addition of lenalidomide (10 \u03bc M) in standard ADCC assays increased XmAb5592 (0.1 \u03bc g/ml)-induced cell lysis against MM1S, MM1R, and RPMI8226 cells in the presence of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from normal donors (n=2). Specifically, XmAb5592 (0.01, and 0.1 \u03bc g/ml) combined with lenalidomide (2.5, 5, 10 \u03bc M), in the presence or absence of IL-2 (100 units/ml), synergistically induced NK-mediated RPMI8226 MM cell lysis, as evidenced by combination index (CI) < 1 (0.08-0.89). Pre-incubation of PBMCs with additional IL-2 (100 units/ml) enhanced even stronger XmAb5592-induced cytotoxicity against MM cells than pretreatment with lenalidomide alone. Lenalidomide also enhanced PBMC effectors to kill primary patient MM cells. Cell surface CD107a, as a functional marker for NK cell activation dependent on granzyme B secretion, was further determined following target myeloma cell incubation, with or without NK cells and in the presence of mAbs. NK cells were activated by as low as 0.001 \u03bc g/ml of XmAb5592 only in the presence of MM1S tumor cells. In contrast, neither XmAb6166, an Fc-domain knockout of XmAb5592 without NK binding, nor XmAb4614, a similar Fc-engineered mAb targeting respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antigen, induced any cell surface CD107a on NK cells incubated with MM cells. Specific XmAb5592-induced CD107a-dependent NK cell degranulation further correlated with IFN\u03b3 secretion (r=0.7, p=0.03). XmAb5592 induced > 10-fold more potent NK degranulation than XmAb5627, which significantly correlated with MM cell lysis by ADCC, even in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Moreover, no significant HM1.24 was expressed on NK cells stimulated with or without IFN-\u03b1, suggesting minimal NK toxicity. XmAb5592 more potently (>10-fold) than XmAb5627 induces homotypic aggregation and adhesion of NK cells, which was further enhanced by lenalidomide. Finally, minimal HM1.24 expression was confirmed on different PBMC subsets including CD15+ (PMN), CD19+ (B), CD14+ (MC), and CD3+ (T) cells. These results indicate that lenalidomide further potentiates XmAb5592-induced myeloma cell killing via NK-mediated ADCC, providing a rationale to combine both novel drugs to improve patient outcome in MM.
