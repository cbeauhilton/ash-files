    "abstract_text": "Background and objective Fludarabine in combination with cyclophosphamide (FC) plus rituximab (R) is an effective treatment for newly diagnosed as well as relapsed follicular lymphoma (Tam 2004; Keating 2005; Sacchi 2007). Maintenance treatment with R, after different induction treatments, improves overall and progression-free survival (Forstpointner 2006; van Oers 2006). Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the FC-R regime followed by maintenance doses of R. Patients and Methods We present an intermediate report of the one-arm study in which 75 previously untreated patients with a diagnosis of follicular non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in Ann Arbor stage II\u2013IV were included between October 2004\u20132006. Seventy four were assessed for safety after receiving at least one FC-R dose (F: 3x25 mg/m2 and C: 1 g/m2; R: 375mg/m2), and 72 for response to treatment. Patients aged 53.4 years in average, one in five showed bulky disease and 72.2% Ann Arbor IV staging. FLIPI index determined 23.9% patients with low (0\u20131) score, 38% with intermediate (2) and 38% with poor score (3). A total of 47 patients presented some molecular alteration in PB or BM. Results Induction therapy was delivered throughout 4\u20136 courses, resulting in 91% complete responses (CR) and 9% partial responses (PR) (Table 1). From the patients who presented monoclonal population at diagnosis, 40 were evaluated for molecular response after induction and only 1 remained MDR positive for bcl2/IgH. Overall survival (OS) at 24 months was 87.5%, and two patients presented progressive disease within this period. The median OS has not been reached at this evaluation. To the date, 262 adverse effects grade 3\u20134 (32.6%) have been documented (80.9% neutropenias) and 80 infectious complications were recorded (23.8% grade 3\u20134). Three patients died from respiratory diseases, two from acute leukemia, and six from other causes. Table 1  EVOLUTION OF RESPONSE . Evaluated Response at End of Induction Therapy . .

However, as reported in similar studies (Hochster 2007 ASCO), the high incidence of prolonged neutropenias and lymphopenias developed as consequence of the chemotherapy regime, questions the safety of the induction treatment.",
