    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2977 Rationale. Competent immune responses require balanced effector and regulatory arms; cancer may influence either in an attempt to evade immune control. Pharmaco-immunotherapy seeks to redress this imbalance. The mode of action of lenalidomide (Len) in multiple myeloma (MM) is poorly characterized, but is often affirmed to comprise direct antitumor and immunostimulatory effects. Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro methods we analyzed the effect of Len and dexamethasone (Dex) on immune reconstitution in MM patients. Methods. 21 patients with relapsed MM were treated with LenDex, commencing at Len 25mg/day PO D1\u201321 and Dex either 480mg (n=5) or 160mg (n=16) PO per 28 day cycle. Dex doses were tapered after cycle 6; Len doses were adjusted for renal function and hematological toxicity. Peripheral blood (PB) samples were analyzed at baseline and after cycles 1, 4, 7 and 10. PB from age-matched healthy volunteers (n=14) was also analyzed. For in vitro work, the human MM cell line (HMCL) U266B was cultured with naive CD4 + CD25 \u2212 T cells at a 1:2 ratio in complete medium (no additional cytokines). Where indicated, U266B was incubated with Len for 24 hours, then washed prior to coculture. Cells were harvested after 7 days for flow cytometric analysis. Results. Coculture of HMCL with sorted CD4 + CD25 \u2212 T cells in vitro induced T reg (CD4 + CD25 Bright FoxP3 + ) differentiation (31.6% vs. 0.7% without HMCL, n=10, p<0.001), with only minimal effector T cell (T eff ) generation (CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 \u2212 ). Incubation of HMCL with Len prior to coculture selectively suppressed T reg cell generation (Len: 3.2\u00b11.1%, DMSO (vehicle): 36\u00b14.4%, p<0.001), giving rise to a higher T eff :T reg ratio. Apoptosis in HMCL after coculture was similar in Len- and DMSO-treated cells (Len: 38.2\u00b10.9%, DMSO: 39.35\u00b10.8%, p=NS). Patients with MM showed profound CD4 + lymphopenia (MM: 369\u00b182 cells/\u03bcl, controls: 700\u00b1182 cells/\u03bcl; p=0.027), which was not corrected by LenDex, despite steroid tapering. The number of recent thymic emigrants (RTE: CD4 + CD45RA + CD31 + ) in MM patients was significantly lower than in control subjects (MM: 37.4\u00b19.9/\u03bcl, control: 159\u00b125.1/\u03bcl, p=0.0002). A significant reduction in the proportion of RTE was seen after cycle 1 of LenDex (11+2.2%, p=0.028) with evidence of recovery toward normal both in terms of proportion (17.4+3.4%, p=0.48) and absolute numbers (65.13+3.5, p=0.042) by cycle 7. We examined the activation status of circulating lymphocytes and noted a significant increase in the proportion of CD3 + cells expressing HLA-DR compared with controls (50.6+4% vs. 17.7+2.8%, p<0.0001); this was unaffected by LenDex. In contrast, activated CD4 + T eff cells (CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 \u2212 ) were significantly reduced in the PB of MM patients pre-treatment compared to controls (26.1+5.1% vs. 45.6+2.3%, p<0.001). LenDex increased the proportion of activated CD4 + T cells (1-way ANOVA p=0.021); this was predominantly seen between cycles 4 and 7. As has been reported previously, T reg cells as a proportion of CD4 + cells were expanded in MM patients (MM: 10.92\u00b12.7%, controls: 3.24\u00b10.3%, p=0.005), although absolute counts were not significantly lower (MM: 45.5\u00b115/\u03bcl, controls: 67.3\u00b18/\u03bcl, p=0.181). T reg cells rapidly fell early in LenDex therapy, but returned to baseline in association with steroid tapering. There was a non-significant correlation between the baseline level of T reg cells and time to progression (TTP; r 2 =0.707, p=0.08) and a significant correlation between the level of T reg cells after cycle 4 and TTP (r 2 =0.669, p=0.009). The T eff :T reg ratio in patients at baseline was lower than in controls (9.2+3 vs 14.8+1, p=0.05). Whilst an early reduction in the ratio was seen with higher steroid dosing, the ratio rose above baseline by cycle 4 (9.2+3 vs. 11.4+3.6; p=NS). Neither baseline (p=0.29) nor cycle 4 (p=0.22) ratios correlated with TTP. Conclusions. Patients with MM exhibit marked immune dysfunction, particularly characterized by imbalance between the effector and regulatory arms of the immune response. Using an in vitro culture system we show lenalidomide abrogates the ability of MM cells to drive T eff :T reg imbalance. Furthermore, in the clinic, LenDex therapy for patients with relapsed MM leads to correction of the T eff :T reg ratio. Further appraisal is now required to allow correlation of this immunotherapeutic effect with clinical outcomes. Disclosures: Cook: Celgene: Consultancy; Janssen: Consultancy."
