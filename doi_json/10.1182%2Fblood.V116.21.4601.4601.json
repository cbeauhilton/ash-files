    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4601 Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is generally characterized by poor prognosis. To determine the role of Hyper-CVAD chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in PTCL, we retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 31 patients with PTCL between 1999 and 2009. 15 patients received Hyper-CVAD chemotherapy with 3-year overall survival (OS) of 52.4% and 3-year progression free survival (PFS) of 25.7%. 16 patients received ASCT with 3-year OS of 76.2% and 3-year PFS of 61.3%. There was significant difference in 3-year PFS between the two treatments (P=0.012). Additionally, patients underwent ASCT with elevated LDH, \u2265 2 IPI points and extranodal involvement had a favorable outcome comparing with the ones received Hyper-CVAD chemotherapy. These findings might suggest that ASCT likely offer a durable survival benefit for patients with aggressive peripheral T cell lymphoma. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
