    "abstract_text": "Hydroxyurea (HU) is an antineoplastic drug, which also plays an important role in treatment of sickle cell disease patients (SCD). Short-term HU toxicities primarily include transient myelosuppression, but long-term HU risks have not been defined. The mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of HU is not established, although HU has been associated with an increased risk of leukemia in some patients with myeloproliferative disorders. In the present study we analyzed the presence of DNA damage in patients with SCD treated with HU, in peripheral blood lymphocytes, using micronucleus assay. We analyzed 36 patients with SCD (16 males and 20 females), aged 2\u201359 years (mean 25,75 \u00b1 14,5), received oral HU median dose of 26,5 mg/Kg/day, for a period of 0.6\u2013 11,8 years (mean 5,01). The control group was composed of 34 healthy individuals (16 males and 18 females), aged 4\u201352 years (mean 26,61 \u00b1 7,20). The results revealed that frequency of micronucleus was significantly higher in SCD patients using HU than in controls(p=0,0182). This study indicates a possible genotoxicity of the HU, although further works are necessary to evaluate its mutagenicity.",
