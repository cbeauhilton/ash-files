    "abstract_text": "DDAVP is effective treatment for VWD patients with adequate biologic response to administration of a trial dose. Intranasal therapy offers the advantage of ease of administration. Few prospective data evaluating response to intranasal DDAVP exist, especially in less common types such as type 2M VWD. As part of a study of a large Amish kindred of VWD in Northern Indiana, we conducted a prospective open label trial to assess response rate to a single dose of high concentration intranasal DDAVP in 11 affected individuals. Stimate\u00ae Nasal Spray (1.5 mg/ml) with weight based dosing was used. Laboratory parameters obtained prior to and 90 minutes after administration of Stimate\u00ae to assess for response included ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:RCo), factor VIII activity(VIII:C), and VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) values. VWF:RCo \u2265 40% at 90 minutes post Stimate\u00ae administration was defined as adequate response. Of 212 evaluated members, 54 affected members were identified as defined by abnormally low VWF levels (VWF:RCo levels 50 kg; hence two intranasal Stimate\u00ae spray puffs were administered to each patient. Five of eleven patients had response to intranasal DDAVP as evidenced by \u2265 40% VWF:RCo levels 90 minutes after receiving Stimate\u00ae (Response range: 4.0 fold to 4.86 fold rise). The remaining patients did not meet definition of response (Response range: 1.6 fold to 3.8 fold rise). There were no major adverse effects. Nine patients had mild facial flushing alone; one patient had flushing and headache; one patient was asymptomatic. After Stimate\u00ae administration, the patient with gingival bleeding reported complete cessation of bleeding sustained for 24 hours. This is the first and largest report to date assessing response to intranasal DDAVP therapy in 2M VWD patients. High concentration intranasal DDAVP may be used for minor bleeding episodes in those patients with adequate response to a trial dose. It is easily self administered as home based first line hemostatic therapy. Intranasal DDAVP is well tolerated with minimal adverse effects. Prospective clinical correlation of efficacy is underway in this population. RESULTS OF STIMATE\u00ae TESTING  AGE/SEX . BASELINE FVIII:C (%) . BASELINE VWF:AG(%) .
