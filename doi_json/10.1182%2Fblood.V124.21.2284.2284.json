    "abstract_text": "Background Approximately 10% of cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) arise following exposure to chemotherapy (treatment-related AML [tAML]). Compared to de novo AML patients, tAML patients have a poor prognosis, not least due to a higher proportion having adverse cytogenetics. Treatment options for tAML patients are limited and outcomes remain dismal. Median overall survival (OS) of 6.9 mo as of initial presentation, with 25% deaths within one month of diagnosis, was reported for a large cohort of tAML patients, with individualized treatments ranging from supportive care, to intensive chemotherapy (IC) and bone marrow (BM) transplantation. 1 Few studies have assessed azacitidine (AZA) in patients with tAML, and those that have, did not report separate outcomes for this subgroup. 2\u20134 Methods Here, we compare a subgroup of tAML patients (n=27) with patients with other World Health Organization (WHO)-AML subgroups (n=319) from the Austrian AZA Registry. The aim of the registry was to gain insight of the use, safety and efficacy of AZA in \u2018real-world\u2019 AML patients. The sole inclusion criteria were the diagnosis of WHO-AML and treatment with \u22651 dose of AZA. Results Baseline characteristics were compared between patients with tAML and WHO-AML: median age, gender, percentage with myelodysplatic syndrome (MDS)-related features, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, and median peripheral blood and BM blasts were similar between both cohorts. However, tAML patients had poorer Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) scores, more comorbidities, and a higher proportion of high-risk cytogenetics compared with WHO-AML patients. Of patients with tAML, 41% received AZA as 1 st line therapy and 59% received AZA as \u22652 nd line therapy. Baseline characteristics of these two subgroups were also comparable, except that tAML patients treated with AZA 1 st line were older, had poorer ECOG PS and worse cytogenetics than \u22652 nd line patients, which is in line with what would be expected from a cohort not deemed eligible for IC ( Figure 1 ). Median number of AZA cycles was 4 (range 1\u201325) for tAML patients and 4 (range 1\u201346) for WHO-AML patients. Median time from AZA stop to death was 1.9 vs 1.8 mo for patients with tAML vs other WHO-AML subgroups. The overall response rate (ORR; International Working Group [IWG] 2003 criteria 5 ) as well as the rate of hematologic improvement (HI; IWG 2006 criteria 6 ) were similar for patients with tAML vs WHO-AML treated with AZA (complete response [CR] + CR with incomplete blood count recovery [CRi] + partial response [PR]: 22.2 vs 29.5%; and HI: 58.8 vs 57.7%, respectively; Figure 1 ). Median OS was similar for patients with tAML vs WHO-AML (8.9 vs 9.4 mo; p=0.147; Figure 1 ), but was longer for responders than non-responders in both groups of patients. Relapse-free survival was 7.7 vs 9.1 mo for patients with tAML vs WHO-AML. In univariate analyses, baseline factors that significantly affected OS for tAML patients were LDH >225IU/L (p<0.001) and white blood cell count \u226510G/L (p<0.001; Figures 2a, b). Patients with tAML who received AZA 1 st line achieved a significantly higher ORR than those who received AZA \u22652 nd line (36.4 vs 12.5%; p<0.001). Median time to AZA start as of initial diagnosis was 0.7 and 5.1 mo for tAML patients treated with AZA 1 st line or \u22652 nd line, respectively. Median number of AZA cycles was 6 (1\u201325) for AZA 1 st line vs 4 (1\u201315) for AZA \u22652 nd line. Median OS was not significantly different for tAML patients treated with AZA 1 st vs \u22652 nd line (9.0 vs 7.5 mo; p=0.717; Figure 1 ). Median relapse-free survival was 7.7 and 7.4 mo for AZA 1 st line and \u22652 nd line, respectively. tAML patients achieving CR/CRi/PR had a median OS of 16.1 mo with AZA 1 st line and 12.8 mo for AZA \u22652 nd line. Conclusions This represents the largest study reporting outcomes of tAML patients treated with AZA. Survival of tAML patients with AZA was comparable to that achieved in other WHO-AML subgroups, suggesting that AZA is a feasible treatment option for this poor prognostic subgroup. The OS data compare favorably to OS data reported for IC 1 and are encouraging. Based on these \u2018real-world\u2019 data, randomized trials should assess AZA in tAML patients. 1. Smith SM, et al.
