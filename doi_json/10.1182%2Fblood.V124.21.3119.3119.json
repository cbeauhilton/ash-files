    "abstract_text": "CD37 is a surface antigen widely expressed on malignant B cells in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In normal tissues, CD37 expression is restricted to lymphoid tissues and blood cells, with high levels of expression on B lymphocytes and low levels on non-B lymphoid and myeloid cells. IMGN529 is a CD37-targeting ADC currently in a Phase I clinical study in adult patients with relapsed or refractory NHL (NCT01534715). This ADC uniquely combines the intrinsic pro-apoptotic and immune effector activities of its anti-CD37 antibody component with the potent cytotoxic mechanism provided by targeted delivery of its maytansinoid payload, DM1. In the Phase I study, IMGN529 has demonstrated early evidence of clinical activity. A reduction in lymphocyte counts was also observed in the majority of patients after dosing, consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of a CD37-targeted therapy. However, in the initial dose-escalation phase, some patients experienced transient, early-onset neutropenia. To investigate the potential mechanisms of this transient neutropenia observed in patients, different pre-clinical models were considered and utilized to recapitulate clinical findings. In vitro studies with peripheral blood cells from normal human donors demonstrated that incubation with IMGN529 for 1 hour or 24 hours resulted in significant B-cell depletion with no apparent neutrophil depletion detected, similar to observations after rituximab treatment. In contrast, alemtuzumab treatment in vitro resulted in both B-cell and neutrophil depletion. This is consistent with the high level of CD37 expression on target B cells and the relatively low CD37 expression level on other blood cells. Analysis of cytokine release by normal human donor peripheral blood cells incubated with IMGN529 revealed increased levels of IL-8, CCL2 (MCP-1) and CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2), but not IL-6 or TNF, to a similar extent as rituximab but less pronounced than alemtuzumab. An anti-murine CD37 antibody was identified to enable in vivo studies in a murine model and characterize CD37 expression on murine blood cells. Similar to the expression profile of CD37 in human peripheral blood cells, CD37 expression on murine peripheral blood cells was highest in B cells, with much lower expression seen on T cells and granulocytes. In vivo activity of the anti-muCD37 antibody and the corresponding ADC, with the same SMCC-DM1 linker-payload combination as IMGN529, was evaluated to discern antibody and payload-mediated events in comparison to the classic cytotoxic cyclophosphamide (CPA). Treatment of C57/B6 mice with 1-10 mg/kg of anti-muCD37 antibody or anti-muCD37 ADC resulted in a significant decrease in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) lasting greater than 7 days and a transient decrease in absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) lasting 1-2 days. A non-targeted control SMCC-DM1 ADC had no effect on ALC or ANC counts, suggesting the decrease is a CD37-mediated effect. In contrast, treatment with CPA resulted in an ALC decrease with similar kinetics but a more pronounced ANC decline. No impact on bone marrow lymphocyte, myeloid or erythroid precursor cell counts was observed in response to the anti-muCD37 antibody or anti-muCD37 ADC, whereas CPA treatment caused reduced cellularity with a decrease in the percentage of mature myeloid precursors and neutrophils in bone marrow. Elevated levels of CCL2 and CCL4 chemokines were detected in mouse plasma after anti-muCD37 ADC treatment, which may contribute to a redistribution of circulating neutrophils into peripheral tissues. Studies are currently underway to assess neutrophil distribution in murine tissues post anti-muCD37 ADC treatment. Current preclinical studies provide no clear evidence for direct IMGN529-mediated depletion of normal human neutrophils in the context of B-cell depletion in vitro. In vivo studies with an anti-muCD37 ADC recapitulate transient peripheral lymphopenia and neutropenia with no impact on bone marrow precursors observed, indicative of a different mechanism than classic chemotherapy-induced bone marrow myelosuppression. These preliminary results suggest a role for chemokine-mediated neutrophil redistribution following CD37 engagement, which is the subject of further studies.
