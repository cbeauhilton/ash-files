    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: The significance of the lupus anticoagulant (LA) and other antiphospholipid antibodies (APA) in children with thromboembolism (TE) has not been as clearly defined in children as among adults. OBJECTIVE: To characterize TE presentation and prothrombotic risk factors among children with TE who are positive for the LA using the dilute Russell Viper Venom Time (dRVVT) as a screening test. METHODS: Children with acute TE were consecutively enrolled in a prospective inceptional cohort study and a compehensive APA testing battery was serially employed. APA testing included StaClot-LA, as well as ELISA for IgG and IgM binding to prothrombin, protein C, protein S, cardiolipin and \u03b22GP1. RESULTS: 34 children who were dRVVT positive within 3 months of acute thrombosis were evaluated with the entire APA battery on 1 to 5 occasions over 3 months to 4 years. Multiple APA were detected in 20 (59% of) study participants (5 tests, n=1; 4 tests, n=2; 3 tests, n=6; 2 tests, n=11; 1 test, n=14). Findings were: dRVVT (100%), anti-prothrombin (50%), StaClot (18%), anti-protein S and ACA (12% each), anti-\u03b22GP1 (6%) and anti-protein C (3%). TE presentation and prothrombotic risk factors were compared between these 20 children with multiple APA and 14 children who were dRVVT positive only (Tables 1 and 2). Children with LA-associated TE who had multiple APA were more likely to present with parenchymal sites of thrombosis (p=0.03) and appeared less likely to have otherwise-idiopathic TE (i.e., no additional prothrombotic risk factors identified), although the latter trend was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of children with acute TE and a positive dRVVT in whom a comprehensive battery of APA is performed demonstrate multiple APA, among which anti-prothrombin antibodies are the most common. When compared to children positive for dRVVT only, children with LA-associated thrombosis who have multiple APA are particularly predisposed to parenchymal thrombotic events and may be more likely to experience otherwise-idiopathic TE. Future investigations will evaluate the risk of recurrent TE in children with thrombosis relative to findings on serial comprehensive APA testing. Table 1. Thrombus Sites*, by APA Group.  APA group .
