    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1451 Children with Down syndrome (DS) have a 10- to 20-fold increased risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In DS-associated ALL (DS-ALL), the chromosome aberrations which are generally common in childhood ALL, such as hyperdiploidy and t(12;21), are less frequent. Recent studies have shown that activating JAK2 mutations and overexpression of cytokine receptor-like factor 2 ( CRLF2 ) gene are identified in approximately 20% and 50\u201360% of DS-ALL in Western countries, respectively. Most of the patients with CRLF2 overexpression have been reported to be associated with interstitial deletions of the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) of the sex chromosomes and the P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion gene. In addition, one report showed that the activating CRLF2 F232C mutation was identified in about 10% of DS-ALL. However, there have been no studies to determine the incidence of these genetic aberrations in Asian patients with DS-ALL. In this study, 23 patients with DS-ALL in Japan were screened for mutations in the pseudokinase domain of the JAK2 gene, the P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion gene, and the CRLF2 F232C mutation by PCR/RT-PCR and direct sequencing. Fourteen patients, whose bone marrow RNAs were available, were also screened for CRLF2 overexpression by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. We identified the JAK2 R683G mutation in 2 patients (9%) and the P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion gene in 4 patients (17%). The CRLF2 F232C mutation was not detected in any patient. CRLF2 overexpression was observed in 2 of 14 patients examined (14%). Although bone marrow RNA was available in only 1 of 4 patients positive for P2RY8-CRLF2 , high-level expression of CRLF2 was confirmed in this patient. The other patient with CRLF2 overexpression was negative for P2RY8-CRLF2 , indicating the involvement of the other type of CRLF2 rearrangement, IGH@-CRLF2 in this patient. We also performed a preliminary study on JAK1 , JAK3 , and Interleukin-7 receptor-\u03b1 ( IL7R ) mutations, and 14, 11, and 12 patients were screened for mutations in the pseudokinase domain of JAK1 , JAK3 , and exon 5 and 6 of IL7R , respectively. However, no mutations were identified in any patient. Our results show the lower incidence of CRLF2 rearrangements in DS-ALL patients in Japan than that in Western countries. Gene alterations other than CRLF2 rearrangements may contribute to leukemogenesis in Japanese patients with DS-ALL. To clarify if the incidences of the mutations in JAK1-3 , CRLF2 , and IL7R are also lower in DS-ALL patients in Japan than those in Western counties, more patients need to be studied.
