    "abstract_text": "Aim Hemophilia A and B has been associated with increased prevalence of low bone mineral density (BMD). However, the utility of bone turnover markers (BTM) is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate bone metabolism in men with hemophilia and investigate associations between BTM and bone disease. Methods Serum N- (NTX-I), C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase band-5b (TRAP-5b), as bone resorption markers, and osteocalcin (OC) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (b-ALP), as bone formation markers, were assessed. Results Seventy men (mean age 45.4\u00b114.7 years) with hemophilia A (n=59) or B (n=11) were studied. Patients with low BMD had significantly higher b-ALP concentrations compared with those with normal BMD, without any differences in the other BTM. NTX-I and CTX-I concentrations were negatively associated with estradiol concentrations and hip BMD and positively with HIV infection, number of affected joints and arthropathy scores. B-ALP and OC concentrations were negatively associated with hip BMD, severity of hemophilia and fracture history, and positively with the number of affected joints and testosterone concentrations. In men with low BMD, NTX-I, TRAP-5b and b-ALP concentrations were positively correlated with the number of affected joints, whereas TRAP-5b concentrations were positively associated with arthropathy scores and negatively with the level of physical activity. Conclusion Increased bone metabolism exists in men with hemophilia and low BMD. Arthropathy, low physical activity and low estradiol concentrations are associated with increased bone resorption and may contribute to the pathogenesis of low BMD in these patients.
