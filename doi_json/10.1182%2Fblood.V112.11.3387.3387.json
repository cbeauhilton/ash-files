    "abstract_text": "Therapy of hemophilia A has greatly benefited from the development of safe recombinant and plasmatic factor VIII (FVIII) concentrates. Current efforts to improve products focus on the extension of half-life by chemical and/or molecular modifications of FVIII. However, any modification of the FVIII protein poses the risk of creating neo-antigens that might cause FVIII inhibitors to be induced in patients. Therefore it is important to monitor the potential creation of neo-antigens during preclinical and clinical phases of drug development. Currently available animal models for hemophilia A develop high titers of anti-FVIII antibodies when treated with human FVIII. Using these models, it is difficult to differentiate between immune responses against native human FVIII and immune responses against human FVIII that carries neo-antigens. Considering these limitations, our aim is to develop a new model for hemophilia A that does not respond with antibodies to native human FVIII but develops antibodies against human FVIII that carries neo-antigens. We created a series of hemophilic mouse lines that carry a transgene for human FVIII that was placed under the control of an albumin promoter to direct liver-specific expression. Transgenic founder mice were generated by direct microinjection of the vector into the male pronucleus of fertilized oocytes obtained from mated female C57BL/6J mice after superovulation. Transgenic mice were crossed with hemophilic mice and bred to homozygousity for the expression of the human FVIII transgene. We analyzed the expression of human FVIII by real time PCR in lung, kidney, liver, heart, muscle, spleen, lymph nodes and reproductive organs. Gene expression analysis of bone marrow and thymus are currently ongoing. We selected three sublines (E, G and I) that show different levels of liver-specific expression of human FVIII for further analysis. We did not detect any FVIII antigen in the circulation in any of these three sublines when we used two different ELISA systems with detection limits around 1 ng/ml. We treated mice of sublines E, G and I intravenously with eight weekly doses of 200 ng of human FVIII (Advate) and analyzed the potential development of antibodies against native human FVIII. Our results indicate that transgenic mice of sublines E and I are immunologically tolerant to native human FVIII. They do not develop anti-FVIII antibodies (about 90% of all mice tested) or develop low titers (below 1:80 in 10% of mice tested) only. In contrast, mice of subline G develop high titers of anti-FVIII antibodies indicating that they are not immunologically tolerant to human FVIII. Preliminary data suggest that the degree of immunological tolerance against human FVIII correlates to a certain extent with the expression levels of the human FVIII transgen in liver and/or thymus. We are in the process of verifying these preliminary data. Furthermore, we have started to analyze FVIII-specific T-cell responses to define potential differences in the repertoire of FVIIIspecific T cells between the three sublines. We conclude that transgenic expression of human FVIII under the control of an albumin promoter is able to induce immune tolerance to human native FVIII in hemophilic mice. However, a certain threshold level of gene expression might be required for the induction of immune tolerance.",
