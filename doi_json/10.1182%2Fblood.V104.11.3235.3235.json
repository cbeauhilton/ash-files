    "abstract_text": "CD161 (NKR-P1) is a natural killer receptor of C-type lectin superfamily found on natural killer (NK) cells. A significant number of both human CD4 + and CD8 + T cells express CD161. However, little is known about the extended phenotype or function of CD161 + T cells. Here, we analyzed this population in normal human peripheral blood by immunofluorescent staining, and multi-color flow cytometric analysis (N=15). Amongst CD4 + T cells, a mean of 22% showed intermediate staining for CD161 (CD161 int ) and the remainder were CD161 \u2212 . Almost all the CD4 + CD161 int TCR\u03b1\u03b2 + T cells had the CD45RO + memory phenotype, and did not express the CD16 or CD56 NK markers (<5%). CD4 + CD161 \u2212 T cells were a mixture of CD45RO + and CD45RA + cells. Invariant natural killer T (NKT) cells with the V\u03b124 + /V\u03b211 + TCR are known to express CD161, but CD4 + CD161 int T cells contained less than 1 % of these invariant NKT cells. After in vitro stimulation with \u03b1CD3 and \u03b1CD28 mAb, CD4 + CD161 int T cells produced larger amounts of both Th1 and Th2 type cytokines compared with CD4 + CD161 \u2212 T cells, especially IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-10. However, there was no difference in the proliferative response between CD161 \u2212 and CD161 int CD4 + T cells, and CD4 + CD161 int T cells had no suppressor functions against autologous cell proliferation. In CD8 + T cells, there were two populations that were CD161 positive. One was CD161 hi (mean; 11%) and another was CD161 int (mean; 9%). Almost all CD161 int and CD161 hi CD8 + T cells had the CD45RO + memory phenotype, and few expressed the V\u03b124 + /V\u03b211 + TCR NKT cell marker (<1%) or CD16 (<5%). CD8 + CD161 hi cells contained around 15% of CD56 + and CD8 + CD161 int cells contained around 5% of CD56 + . CD8 + CD161 hi T cells had decreased expression of CD8\u03b2 and 40% of CD8 + CD161 hi T cells expressed only CD8\u03b1. Conversely, most of the CD8\u03b1 + CD8\u03b2 \u2212 T cells in human peripheral blood expressed CD161. After in vitro stimulation with \u03b1CD3 and \u03b1CD28 mAb, CD8 + CD161 hi T cells secreted no IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 or IL-2. Both CD8 + CD161 \u2212 and CD8 + CD161 int T cells produced all three cytokines. CD8 + CD161 hi T cells failed to proliferate after \u03b1CD3+\u03b1CD28 stimulation, though CD8 + CD161 \u2212 and CD8 + CD161 int T cells made vigorous proliferative responses. Thus, it appeared that CD8 + CD161 hi T cells were anergic. This anergic state could not be reversed by addition of IL-2. CD8 + CD161 + T cells had no suppressor function against autologous cell proliferation nor cytotoxicity against the NK or NKT sensitive tumor cell lines, K562 and Jurkat. In conclusion, the CD161 marker can be used to identify subsets of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells that differ in their extended phenotypes and functions. In addition, we identified a unique subset of anergic CD8 + CD161 hi T cells that express a memory phenotype with a low level of CD8\u03b2.",
