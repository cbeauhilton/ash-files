    "abstract_text": "Introduction: In adults, prognosis for B-ALL is poor, patients are more vulnerable to CD19 CAR immunotoxicity and there is currently no CD19 CAR therapeutic with acceptable toxicity and durable efficacy. We have developed a novel second generation CD19CAR (CAT-41BBz CAR), with a faster off-rate but equivalent on rate than the FMC63-41BBz CAR (Kd 116 nM vs 0.9 nM, T 1/2 9s vs 4.2 hours) designed to result in more physiological T-cell activation, reduce toxicity and improve engraftment. Preliminary paediatric clinical data of this novel CD19 CAR (AUTO1) supports this assertion. We here describe preliminary data from ALLCAR19 (NCT02935257), a multi-centre, Phase I clinical study of AUTO1 as therapy for r/r adult B-ALL. Methods: Manufacturing: AUTO1 utilises non-mobilised autologous leucapheresate. The first 6 trial products were generated using a standard dynal bead/WAVE Bioreactor process and subsequent products using a semi-automated closed process. Study design: ALLCAR19 is a phase I/II study recruiting subjects 16-65y with r/r B ALL. Lymphodepletion with fludarabine (30mg/m 2 x3) and cyclophosphamide (60mg/kg x1) is followed by split dose CAR T cell infusion (Day 0: if \u226520% BM blasts, infuse 10 x 10 6 CAR T cells ; if <20% BM blasts, infuse 100 x 10 6 CAR T cells. Day +9: if no Grade 3-5 CRS/CRES, infuse Dose 2, to a total dose of 410 x 10 6 CAR T cells). Study endpoints include feasibility of manufacture, grade 3-5 toxicity and remission rates at 1 and 3 months Results: As of 24 July 2019, 16 patients have been leukaphresed, 14 products manufactured (one failed leukaphresis and one currently in manufacture) and 13 patients have received at least 1 dose of AUTO1. Of the 16 patients, median age was 35.5 (range 18-63), 10/16 (63%) had prior blinatumomab or inotuzumab ozogamicin and 12/16 (75%) had prior HSCT. At the time of pre-conditioning, 9/13 (69%) patients were in morphological relapse with >5% leukemic blasts of which 6/13 (46%) had \u226550% blast. 9/13 patients (69%) received the total target split dose of 410 x 10 6 CAR T cells while 1/13 patients (8%) received a reduced split total dose of 51.3 x 10 6 CAR T cells due to manufacturing constraints. 3/13 patients (23%) received only a first dose of 10 x 10 6 CAR T cells. The dose was administered safely to date: No patients experienced \u2265Grade 3 CRS (using Lee criteria) and only 1/13 (8%) experienced Grade 3 neurotoxicity (dysphasia) that resolved swiftly with steroids. All patients had robust CAR expansion (median peak expansion 172 CAR/uL blood). Of the 13 patients dosed (1/13 pending 28 day follow up), 10/12 (83%) achieved MRD negative CR at 1 month and all patients had ongoing CAR T cell persistence at last follow up. Two patients experienced CD19 negative relapse (one at M3, one at M6), 1 patient died on D17 before first response evaluation, 1 died in molecular CR from sepsis, and 1 died from persistent disease. Currently, 7/12 remain on study and continue in flow/molecular MRD negative remission with a median follow up of 9.0 months (range 1.2-14.8). Conclusions: AUTO1 delivers excellent early remission rates with initial data showing 83% MRD negative CR and robust CAR expansion and persistence. Despite high tumour burden, the safety profile compares favourably to other CD19 CARs, with no cases of severe CRS and only one case of Gr3 neurotoxicity. This is consistent with experience in the paediatric cohort. Updated results will be presented.
