    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Incidence of autosomal recessive disorders is rare, includes deficiencies of clotting factors I, II, V, VII, X, XI, XIII, vitamin K dependent clotting factors, combined factor V & VIII, Von Willebrand disease type 3, Glanzmann Thrombasthenia and Bernard Soulier syndrome. OBJECTIVE: Spectrum of autosomal recessive bleeding disorders (ARBDs] among Pakistani patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out at Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad and Peshawar. PT,aPTT, BT, and fibrinogen levels done. Patients with prolonged APTT were tested for factors VIII and IX. If FVIII was low, von Willebrand factor: antigen (vWF: Ag) and von Willebrand factor: ristocetin cofactor (vWF: RCo) were performed. When PT and aPTT both were prolonged, FII, FV, and FX were tested. Peripheral film and platelet aggregation studies were done for platelet disorders. Urea clot solubility test was done at the end. RESULTS: Out of429 patients, 148 were diagnosed with Hemophilia A, remaining 281 patients had ARBDs. 95 (33.8%) had VWD type 3. Fibrinogen deficiency was found in 34 (12%), Glanzmann Thrombasthenia in 27 (9.6%), factor XIII in 13 (4.6%), factor VII in 12 (4.3%), factor V in 9 (3.2%), 8 (2.8%) in vitamin K dependent clotting factors, , Bernard Soulier in 7 patient (2.5%),factor X in 2 (0.7%), factor II in 2 (0.7%), factor XI and combined factor V and VIII in 1 (0.4%)patients each. 70 patients (16.3%) remained undiagnosed. CONCLUSION: VWD type 3 is the most common deficiency followed by fibrinogen deficiency. Glanzmann thrombasthenia was the third most common ARBD.
