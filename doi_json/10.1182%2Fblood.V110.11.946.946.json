    "abstract_text": "Background: Single autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) is considered the standard of care for younger multiple myeloma (MM) patients (pts). However, it is not curative and virtually all patients will ultimately relapse. As more options, such as biological therapy, are available to treat relapsed disease, the role of a second ASCT as salvage therapy is unclear. Method: Retrospective review of all MM pts who received a 2 nd ASCT as salvage therapy at Princess Margaret Hospital. Results: Between February 1997 and June 2007, 61 MM pts received a second ASCT for relapsed MM at our institution. Median age was 56 yrs (range 35\u201371) at second transplant. 37 pts (61%) were male. Immunoglobulin subtype included IgG (36), IgA (14), light chain (6), nonsecretory (3), IgM(1) and IgD (1). Transplant conditioning regimen for first transplant was high dose melphalan (MEL) 140\u2013200 mg/m2 in 51, MEL/etoposide(E)/TBI in 4, and MELl/TBI in 2. 2 nd ASCT conditioning consisted of MEL + TBI +/\u2212 E in 2, MEL alone in 58 and Busulfan/Cyclophosphomide in 1. The median time from diagnosis to first transplant was 9.7 months (2.0\u201374.2). The median time to relapse after the first transplant was 32.6 months (9.7\u201385.6), with a median interval between transplants of 45.1 months (19.7\u2013 115). Two transplant-related deaths occurred (3%). Response to first transplant was 4 CR (8%), 34 PR (68%), 2 MR (4%) and 10 SD (20%). Nineteen pts went on to maintenance therapy between transplants. Response to second transplant was 4 CR (8%), 41 PR (80%), 5 SD (10%) and 1 PD (2%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 15.8 months (0\u201363.8) while median overall survival (OS) was 4.2 years (0\u20137.0) after 2 nd ASCT. The relationship between progression-free interval after 1 st ASCT and the outcome of the 2nd ASCT is summarized Table 1. Patients can be stratified into two groups, those with a disease free interval of less than or greater than 24 months. The use of maintenance therapy did not differ between the two groups, 6 (40%) in patients with PFS \u226424 months and 13 (28%) in patients with PFS >24 months. Conclusions: 2 nd ASCT is a feasible and safe salvage therapy in patients with relapsed MM. 2nd ASCT is effective in providing a median progression free survival of 1.25 years and median overall survival of 4.2 years after 2 nd ASCT - results that compare favourably with other salvage approaches. Patients with a longer disease free interval after 1 st ASCT experience a better progression free survival and overall survival after 2nd ASCT. It is reasonable, therefore, to consider a 2 nd ASCT if the time to progression is greater than 2 years after first ASCT.
