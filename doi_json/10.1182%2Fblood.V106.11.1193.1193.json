    "abstract_text": "The mutational status of the immunoglobulin variable heavy chain genes (V H ) is a major prognostic indicator in patients with CLL. More recently, additional prognostic categories have been identified by recognizing disease subsets which utilize unique V H genes. Examples include the V3-21 and V3-72 genes which are invariably associated with progressive and stable disease, respectively. The V1\u201369 gene is the most frequently rearranged V H gene in CLL and is almost always unmutated. We therefore investigated whether CLL patients that express this V H gene differ in clinical course and outcome with respect to CLL patients expressing other unmutated V H genes. The study group consisted of 106 consecutive CLLs that had been diagnosed at our institution prior to 2000. The 25 V1\u201369 cases (23.6%) were identified by allele-specific V H gene fingerprinting and all were found to be unmutated by nucleotide sequencing. Forty of the remaining cases were randomly selected for V H gene nucleotide sequence analysis; 19 cases expressed another unmutated V H gene, 14 cases expressed a mutated V H gene and the V H gene sequence could not be determined in 7 cases. The V1\u201369 cases did not differ significantly from cases with other unmutated V H genes with respect to age (median age 60 years for both subgroups), gender (male: female=21:4 for V1\u201369 cases and 13:6 for other V H unmutated cases, P=n.s.) and median follow-up (V1\u201369 cases: median 56 months, range 6 to 109; other V H unmutated cases: median 59 months, range 20 to 97, P=n.s.). The percentage of cases presenting at an advanced stage was higher in the V1\u201369 subgroup (36% of cases in Rai high risk category) than in the subgroup with other unmutated V H genes (5% of cases in Rai high risk category, P=0.027), whereas no significant difference was observed with respect to Ly counts and total tumor burden at diagnosis. Interestingly, 80% of the V1\u201369 cases compared to 42% of cases with other unmutated V H genes had received treatment immediately following diagnosis, but median time to treatment was not significantly different between the two subgroups (1 month vs. 9 months, respectively, P=0.085). To date 24 V1\u201369 cases (96%) and 15 cases with other unmutated V H genes (79%) have died, with median survival times of 56 and 60 months, respectively (P=0.9). For comparison, median survival of the 14 V H mutated cases from this series was 125 months (P<0.0001 with respect to both subgroups with unmutated V H genes). We therefore conclude that chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with a V1\u201369 gene rearrangement constitute a uniform group with unfavorable prognosis, but their survival does not differ significantly from patients with other unmutated V H genes.
