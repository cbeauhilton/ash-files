    "abstract_text": "Chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) is a systemic autoimmune-like syndrome, and donor-type CD4 + T interaction with B cells plays an important role in its pathogenesis. Our recent publication has demonstrated that cGVHD pathogenesis does not require germinal center formation and is associated with expansion of extrafollicular CD44 hi CD62L lo PSGL1 lo CD4 + (PSGL1 lo CD4 + ) T cells in the spleen and GVHD target tissues. The causal role of PSGL1 lo CD4 + T cells in cGVHD pathogenesis remains unclear. With murine and humanized murine models, we show that both murine and human PSGL1 lo CD4 + T cells reside in tissues and do not circulate in the blood, and their high expression of PD-1 and ICOS and production of IL-21 suggest that they provide B cell help. In murine models, PSGL1 lo CD4 + T cells augment plasma cell expansion and autoantibody production via their PD-1 interaction with PD-L2 on B. In humanized mouse models, human PSGL1 lo CD4 + T cells from GVHD target tissues augment memory B cell differentiation into plasma cells and antibody production via their production of IL-21.These results indicate that tissue-resident PSGL1 lo CD4 + T cells augment autoantibody production and cGVHD pathogenesis. Targeting tissue-resident T cells may represent a novel approach for treating cGVHD.
