    "abstract_text": "Background Regimens incorporating modern anti-myeloma drugs, such as carfilzomib (CFZ) and bortezomib (BOR), produce rapid, deep and durable responses in newly diagnosed myeloma patients but their effect on collection of autologous HPC is not well known, including minimal residual disease (MRD) testing of stem cell grafts. Employing older induction regimens (such as VAD), less sensitive flow cytometry techniques detected circulating myeloma cells in 38-46% of autologous HPC grafts (Stewart, et al. JCO. 2001 and Bourhis, et al. Haematologica. 2007). We hypothesized that the use of modern CRd combination therapy including Carfilzomib (CFZ)-Lenalidomide (LEN)-Dexamethasone (DEX) would significantly lower the rates of HPC product contamination. Methods Thirty-six patients, including 29 with MM and 7 with high-risk SMM, underwent HPC mobilization and collection following induction with CRd (n=30), LEN-BOR-DEX (RVd, n=4), Cyclophosphamide-BOR-DEX (CyBorD, n=1) and Cyclophosphamide-BOR-Prednisone (CyBorP, n=1). For HPC mobilization, all patients received 5 days of filgrastim at 10-16 mcg/kg/dose. A combination of the patient\u2019s weight and a peripheral blood CD34 count after 4 doses was used to determine the likelihood of collecting > 4 x10 6 CD34+ cells/ kg in a single apheresis procedure after a fifth filgrastim dose, according to a previously published algorithm from our institution. Only subjects predicted to require > 1 apheresis by the algorithm received Plerixafor (PLX) at 240 mcg/kg/dose on the fifth day along with the fifth filgrastim dose. HPC collection occurred on day 6, 8 hours after the last mobilizing agent(s) administration. Product contamination with myeloma cells (i.e. MRD status) was evaluated using multi-parameter flow cytometry with a minimum of 3 x 10 6 events obtained (sensitivity detection rate 1 x 10 -5 ) to examine expression of 9 antigens by the plasma cells. Results The median age at mobilization was 56.2 years (range 40-73) and 19 (53%) were male. At the time of HPC collection, 20 (55%) patients were in sCR/CR/nCR, 11 (30%) had VGPR with 4 PR (11%) and 1 SD (3%). The mean CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood were 33/uL on day 5 and 55/uL on day 6 for the whole cohort. Thirteen (36%) patients did not need PLX. Interestingly, the mean CD34+ count dropped by a mean of 2% from D5 to D6 in patients not receiving PLX while, as expected, it increased by 304% in those who did. The median number of CD34+ cells collected was 6.86 million/kg (range 2.6-12.5) for the whole cohort, (6.6 million/kg without PLX and 7.52 million with PLX p=0.46). Thirty-three of 36 patients (92%) achieved a collection of > 4 million cells /kg in a single apheresis procedure. The 30 patients treated with CRd had a median of 5 (range = 3-7) prior cycles containing LEN with a median of 12 days (range 1-34) between mobilization and last LEN dose. Only 2 of 36 (5%) products were found to have evidence of tumor cell contamination (i.e. MRD positive) using sensitive multiparameter flow cytometry, one patient in PR after 6 cycles of CRd and a second patient in CR after 5 cycles of RVd. Conclusions Modern anti-myeloma therapies, such as CRd and RVd, allow adequate HPC collection in a single apheresis procedure in most cases and improve the quality of the HPC product with greatly reduced tumor cell contamination compared to historical controls. Indeed, 34/36 (94%) patients treated with modern anti-myeloma therapy collected an MRD negative HPC product. Future prospective studies are needed to assess whether autologous stem cell transplants (ASCT) using tumor-free HPC products collected in the era of modern induction therapies have better outcomes.
