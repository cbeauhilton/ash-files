    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3573 Poster Board III-510 Background MLL/AF4 fusion is the most common abnormality in infant leukemia and is associated with a poor prognosis. Although further study and treatment should be groped for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with MLL/AF4, the lack of a proper animal model has impeded understanding of the molecular mechanism of leukemia associated with the MLL/AF4 fusion gene. Previous mouse models suggest that the tumorigenesis capacity of MLL/AF4 alone is insufficient for development mixed-lineage leukemia. MLL/AF4 is capable of inducing lymphoid malignancy with long latency, which is very different from aggressive pro-B ALL in humans. Recently, we have reported that enhancement of S100A6 (calcyclin) expression played an important role in MLL/AF4-leukemogenesis using murine 32Dc cell line. In this study, we tried to make improved MLL/AF4 transgenic (Tg) mice which reflect human leukemogenicity and analyzed molecular mechanism of MLL/AF4 fusion gene. Methods To get high and sustained expression of MLL/AF4 in hematological lineage, we used MSCV promoter to express MLL/AF4 fusion gene. After MLL/AF4 expression plasmids were injected into fertilized eggs of mice (C57BL/6), the manipulated embryos were transferred into the oviducts of pseudopregnant females to make MLL/AF4 Tg mice. Finally we characterized MLL/AF4 Tg mice and analyzed molecular mechanism of MLL/AF4-leukemogenesis. Results Our new established MLL/AF4 Tg mice had lymphoma earlier than previous MLL/AF4 knock-in mice (median 12M vs 17M). Infiltration of lymphoid cells was located in liver, lung, kidney, and spleen and they consist of pro B-cell (CD45R+CD43+CD19-) lineage. Leukemic change developed two months (median 14M) after appearance of lymphoma. More than 30% of abnormal lymphocytes and severe anemia (RBC: 276\u00d710 4 ml, Hb: 4.9 g/ml) were found in peripheral blood in MLL/AF4 Tg mice. Western blot analysis showed that up-regulation of HoxA9 and S100A6 was detected in MLL/AF4 Tg mouse compared to wild type C57BL/6. Conclusion We succeeded in establishment of improved more aggressive MLL/AF4 Tg mice which reflect MLL/AF4 leukemogenicity of humans. Appearance of lymphoma in our MLL/AF4 Tg mice needed short er latency than those of the previous knock-in mice. Enhancement of HoxA9 and S100A6 expression was involved in MLL/AF4-associated leukemogenesis. We believe that this new MLL/AF4 Tg mouse is useful for study of the molecular mechanisms of MLL/AF4 leukemogenesis and development of new therapy for mixed-lineage leukemia.
