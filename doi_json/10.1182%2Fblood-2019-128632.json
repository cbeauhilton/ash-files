    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Time to treatment (TTT) is an important prognostic factor in patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Maurer et al JCO 2018) where patients who initiate therapy quickly after diagnosis have an inferior event free survival compared to those who do not require such immediate treatment initiation. More recently, TTT has shown to be associated with adverse clinical factors and inferior outcomes in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL; Maurer, et al ASH, 2018). However, there is a paucity of data on the impact of TTT on overall survival (OS). We sought to validate these findings and to evaluate the impact of TTT on survival outcomes in newly diagnosed patients with MCL. Methods: We included patients from 12 medical centers in the United States with MCL diagnosed between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2018, who had information on the TTT and initiated treatment within 60 days of diagnosis (to exclude patients whose treatment was purposefully deferred). TTT was defined as the time in days from first lymphoma diagnosis to initiation of therapy. Patients who received treatment within 14 days were categorized into short TTT group. We compared differences between the two groups (TTT 14 days and \u2264 60 days, longer TTT group) using chi-squared test, Fisher's exact tests, or ANOVA tests as appropriate. OS was defined as the time from diagnosis to death or last follow-up. Patients not experiencing an event were censored at their last known follow-up. OS was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method, and univariable and multivariable models were developed to identify predictors of OS. Results: Of 1,168 patients with newly diagnosed MCL, seven hundred fifty-five patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in this analysis, including 205 (27%) with short TTT and 550 (73%) with longer TTT. Median time to treatment was 7 days (range, 0-14) for the short TTT group vs 31 days for the longer TTT group (range, 15-60 days). The median age for the entire cohort was 63 years, 75% of patients were male, and 93% of patients had ECOG 0-1. The proportion of patients with stage 4 disease (93 vs 86%, p=0.015), elevated LDH (58 vs 39%, p3 cytogenetic abnormalities (29 vs 14%, p=0.005), B symptoms (47 vs 29%, p<0.001) and high MIPI score (49 vs 27%, p<0.001) was higher in short TTT group compared to longer TTT group. 65% received intensive induction therapy in the short TTT group relative to 57% in the longer TTT group (p=0.046) (Table). On univariable analysis, factors associated with inferior OS included, TTT=2 (p10k (p=0.002), BM involvement (p=2 (HR=2.25, 95%CI=1.22-4.14; p=0.009), elevated LDH (HR=1.81, 95%CI=1.16-2.85; p=0.01), and receipt of non-intensive regimen (HR=1.61, 95%CI=1.04-2.50; p=0.03) were significant predictors of OS while B symptoms was not. Conclusions: Short TTT for patients with newly diagnosed MCL is associated with aggressive disease features and inferior OS despite an increased likelihood of receiving intensive induction regimens. Further studies are needed to identify molecular determinants of such aggressive disease behavior that can be assessed quickly and utilized to initiate appropriate therapy in a timely manner. Ongoing front-line clinical trials in MCL should be developed in a way to facilitate enrollment of patients requiring urgent therapy, including potentially permitting a cycle of off-study treatment to manage symptoms while a patient is screened and enrolled.
