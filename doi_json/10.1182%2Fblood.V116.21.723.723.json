    "abstract_text": "Abstract 723 Recent studies indicate that multimolecular complexes of platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin (H) are central to the pathogenesis of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). PF4/H multimolecular complexes are recognized preferentially by HIT antibodies (Rauova, Blood 2005) and are potently immunizing in a murine immunization model (Suvarna, Blood 2005). Because PF4/H multimolecular complexes assemble through non-specific electrostatic interactions, we hypothesized that disruption of PF4/H charge-dependent interactions could reduce immune mediated complications. To test this hypothesis, we employed a minimally anticoagulant compound (2-O, 3-O desulfated heparin, or ODSH, ParinGenix, Inc.) and characterized the charge-dependent interactions of murine PF4 (mPF4), ODSH and unfractionated heparin (UFH). In chromogenic assays of thrombin (IIa) generation, UFH was >80-fold more potent than ODSH in inactivating heparin (IC 50 of residual IIa generation for UFH=3.1 nM v. ODSH= 259 nM, (Figure 1A). However, when equimolar amounts of UFH or ODSH (1.7 mM) were tested in a PF4 neutralization assay (Saggin, Thrombosis and Haemostasis 1992), the amount of mPF4 required to neutralize 50% of the anticoagulant activity of ODSH (IC50) was 25\u03bcg/mL, as compared to 73\u03bcg/mL for UFH (~3-fold difference), indicating that charge-dependent interactions, but not anticoagulant activity, were preserved between PF4 and ODSH (Figure 1B). When ODSH was added at 2.5, 5 or 10 fold molar excess to a fixed amount of UFH (6nM) in the PF4 neutralization assay, a proportionate increase in the amount of PF4 was needed to neutralize UFH, indicating that ODSH promotes the anticoagulant effect of UFH through preferential binding of PF4. To further characterize the biophysical interactions of PF4, ODSH and UFH, we used spectrophotometry and zeta potential to study the multimolecular complex formation (Suvarna, Blood 2007). We noted that mPF4 and ODSH formed multimolecular complexes at molar ratios of 2:1, whereas mPF4 and UFH complexes occurred at molar ratios of 1:1. When increasing concentrations of ODSH were added to pre-formed PF4/H multimolecular complexes, we noted a decrease in absorbance with increasing amounts of ODSH, indicating disruption of PF4/H multimolecular complexes (Figure 1C). However, when increasing amounts of UFH was added to preformed PF4/ODSH multimolecular complexes, a plateau in signal was noted, suggesting a higher affinity of ODSH for PF4. In PF4/H immunoassays, incubation of ODSH (1\u03bcg/mL) with HIT antibodies was effective in reducing antibody binding by >50% as compared to wells without ODSH. HIT antibodies did not recognize hPF4 (10mg/mL) in complex with ODSH (0.4-3.2 mg/mL), indicating minimal cross-reactivity of HIT antibodies with PF4/ODSH complexes (Figure 1D). In summary, we show that ODSH, a minimally anticoagulant heparin, can disrupt PF4/H multimolecular complex formation through charge dependent interactions and interfere with HIT antibody binding. These studies suggest that manipulation of PF4:H charge interactions can be a potential therapeutic strategy in the management of HIT.
