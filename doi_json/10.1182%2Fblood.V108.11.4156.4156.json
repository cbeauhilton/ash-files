    "abstract_text": "Heavy ion particles provide unique properties in radiotherapy. However, they have also been shown to pose high risks for both work at nuclear facilities and astronauts participating in space missions. In a previous study, we demonstrated that in radio-sensitive megakaryocyte progenitor cells, namely colony-forming unit megakaryocytes (CFU-Meg), a degree of X-ray-induced damage was prevented by post-treatment with several cytokines. In this study, we analyzed the effects of heavy ion particles on megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. The CD34 + CFU-Meg were isolated from human placental and umbilical cord blood using a magnetic isolation kit and then were exposed to a carbon ion beam (LET=50 KeV/mm). They were cultured in a serum free medium supplemented with a thrombopoietin (TPO) alone or a combination of TPO plus other cytokines including stem cell factor, interleukin-3 (IL-3) and Flt3-ligand. The number of CFU-Meg was calculated by a plasma clot technique. The differentiation into megakaryocytes (CD41 + ) and the release of platelets (CD42a + ) in a liquid culture were both analyzed by flow cytometry. The increase of gamma-H2AX, a marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) was also detected by flow cytometry. The sensitivity of CFU-Meg to a carbon ion beam was found to be extremely high and could not be lowered by any type of cytokines unlike X-rays. However, treatment with TPO plus IL-3 potentially induced megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis at 14 days after the exposure to a carbon ion beam at 2 Gy. The cytokine treatment enhanced the induction of gamma-H2AX in X-ray-irradiated CD34 + CFU-Meg but not in a carbon ion beam-irradiated one. These results show that not only the downregulation of death signals, but also the repair of DSBs was less strongly promoted by cytokines in CFU-Meg exposed to a carbon ion beam than X-rays. Different treatments therefore are required to protect against megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis damage by heavy ion particles."
