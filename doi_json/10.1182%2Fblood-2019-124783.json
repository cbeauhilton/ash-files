    "abstract_text": "Background: Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent lymphoma and is generally characterized by prolonged survival with multiple relapses throughout the disease course. There is no standard of care as to the initial choice or sequencing of treatments for relapsed disease. Novel agents approved in the relapsed setting include lenalidomide in combination with rituximab (R 2 ) and PI3K inhibitors (PI3Ki) including idelalisib, duvelisib, and copanlisib. However, there are no prospective data comparing the safety/efficacy of these novel agents to guide treatment selection. We aimed to examine the characteristics and outcomes of patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma treated with these novel agents. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of adult patients with FL treated with commercially-available novel agents at 10 US academic cancer centers. Patients were excluded if they received one of these therapies as first line therapy or for the treatment of transformed disease. Treatment with lenalidomide or PI3Ki was determined by the treating physician, as was the decision to incorporate monoclonal antibody (mAb). For patients who received both classes of novel agent, baseline and treatment characteristics were grouped by first novel class used. The Fisher's Exact test was used to compare categorical variables and the Mann Whitney U test for continuous variables. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as time from the initiation of the first novel agent to progression of disease (POD), either FL or transformed disease, or death from any cause. Overall survival (OS) was defined as time from the initiation of the first novel agent to death from any cause. Outcomes were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Results: 98 patients were included. Available baseline characteristics at diagnosis are described in Table 1. The median time from the end of the last FL treatment to the start of the first novel agent was 12 months (range 0-79). The first novel agent was lenalidomide +/-mAb in 49% (n=48) of the patients and a PI3Ki +/- mAb in 51% (n=50) of patients. Idelalisib was the most commonly used PI3Ki (n=47) followed by copanlisib (n=2) and duvelisib (n=1). The median number of therapies prior to the first novel agent was 2 (range 1-8) and not significantly different between treatment classes. Reason for discontinuation of novel agent was significantly different between groups with greater discontinuations due to toxicity (40% vs 28%) and transformed disease (15% vs. 3%) for the PI3Ki \u00b1 mAb group vs. lenalidomide \u00b1 mAb group, respectively ( p = 0.02). The median PFS and OS for the entire cohort was 10 months (95% CI 7.6-14) and 120 months (95% CI, 49-NA), respectively (Figure A). When comparing outcomes to current FDA approvals-lenalidomide + mAb (n=43) versus PI3Ki monotherapy (PI3Ki, n=38), the median PFS was significantly longer in the lenalidamide + mAb group compared to the PI3Ki group (15 vs. 6 months, p =0.016), as was the OS (120 vs. 37 months, p =0.002, respectively, Figure B). Conclusions: In this multi-center analysis, despite multiple relapses, the median survival for FL patients treated with novel agents was 120 months from the initiation of the first novel therapy. With the caveat of retrospective comparison, lenalidomide + mAb (i.e. R 2 ) appears superior to PI3Ki as first novel agent in the relapsed setting with the recognition that a high proportion of patients discontinued PI3Ki due to toxicity. Because the majority of the patients received idelalisib conclusions cannot be drawn about alternative PI3Ki which may have lower toxicity profiles or intermittent dosing strategies, allowing for safer and more prolonged treatment. Future prospective studies are needed to directly compare these agents and determine optimal sequencing of therapies.
