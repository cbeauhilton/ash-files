    "abstract_text": "Fetal hemoglobin (HbF; \u03b12\u03b32) ameliorates vaso-occlusive symptoms in individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) because of its ability to inhibit hemoglobin S polymerization. One mechanism for \u03b3-globin reactivation likely involves chromatin modification and the release of repressor complexes in which histone deacetylases (HDACs) may be present. The objective of this study was to identify HDACs involved in \u03b3-globin gene regulation. Experiments were performed in K562 cells to determine the ability of NaB (2mM), TSA (0.5\u03bcm) and the non-HDAC-inhibitor \u03b3-globin activator hemin (50\u03bcM), to alter transcription levels of the HDAC genes during concomitant HbF induction. Gene expression was measured by reverse transcription (RT) of mRNA followed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis using gene-specific primers. Treatment of K562 cells with TSA and NaB reduced transcription levels of both HDAC9 and HDRP (histone deacetylase related protein, a splice variant of HDAC9) from 20\u201380% as did the control agent hemin (p<0.05). By contrast, expression of HDAC7 and HDAC10 was enhanced in the presence of both HDAC inhibitors. The altered HDAC gene expression levels provided indirect evidence for a possible role in mechanisms of \u03b3-globin response to drug inducers. Subsequent experiments were performed to delineate whether HDAC9 and HDRP are directly involved in \u03b3-globin regulation. We performed siRNA knockdown of HDAC9 and HDRP in K562 cells to determine the effect on expression of endogenous \u03b3-globin. siRNA oligonucleotides were transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) for 48 hrs and expression of targeted genes were quantified by RT-qPCR. siHDAC9 and siHDRP (Dharmacon) treatment resulted in dose-dependent \u03b3-globin silencing and transactivation respectively at 80\u2013320nM. Experiments were then performed with 160nM of siHDAC9 or siHDRP in the K562 cell lines which were stably transfected with a luciferase reporter (pGL4.17-Luc2-neo, Promega) under the control of G\u03b3-globin promoter (\u22121500 to +36) and the pGL4.17-Luc2-neo empty vector. We likewise observed a 30% decrease in luciferase activity with siHDAC9 and a 40% increase with siHDRP suggesting that HDAC9 and its variant are directly involved in regulation of \u03b3-promoter activity. In summary, the effects on endogenous \u03b3 globin levels and G\u03b3 globin promoter activity through HDAC9/HDRPspecific knockdown by siRNA experiments suggest that HDAC9 molecules play a role in regulating \u03b3-globin gene expression. We conclude that HDAC9 and HDRP have opposite regulatory effect on \u03b3-globin gene expression and may act by a feedback mechanism.",
