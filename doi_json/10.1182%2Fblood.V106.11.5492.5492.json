    "abstract_text": "Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a recognised option of post-consolidation therapy for adults with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) not having a donor. G-CSF-stimulated peripheral blood SCT results in faster recovery compared to cryopreserved bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and is currentlly used by the majority of centres. In the current study we analyze the feasibility of a new technique of autologous BMT, which does not require cryopreservation. 115 adult patients (median age 24.5 (16\u201353) years) with high-risk ALL in first complete remission (CR) were treated with autologous BMT between 1991\u20132004 in a single center using uniform standard operating procedures. Immune phenotype was as follows: proB 17%, preB 9%, common 44%, mature B 1%, preT 9%, mature T 19%. Initial WBC was >30 G/l in 30% of patients. 8% of patients were bcr/abl(+), 38% required >1 course of induction to achieve CR. Bone marrow was collected in general anaesthesia and further stored for 72 hours in 4degC without any processing and reinfused 24 hours after completion of myeloablative therapy. Conditioning regimen (CAV) consisted of cytarabine 2x1000 mg/m2 d. \u22123, \u22122, \u22121, etoposide 800 mg/m2 d. \u22123, \u22122, cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg d. \u22123, \u22122. Median NC dose was 2.0 (0.9\u201310.8)x10e8, CD34+cell dose \u2212 1.6 (0.4\u201315)x10e6/kg. Median recovery of ANC>0.5 G/l equaled 16(11\u201345) days, PLT>50 G/l \u2013 16(10\u201353) days (11% patients received cytokines to stimulate NC recovery). Median duration of hospital stay since the date of BMT was 19(13\u201351) days. The OS rate at 10 years (median follow-up 6.5 years) equaled 57% (+/\u22125%), LFS rate \u2212 47% (+/\u22125%). Three patients died within 100 days after ABMT of septic infections (non-relapse mortality rate \u2212 2.6%). None of the analysed factors (age, WBC at diagnosis, immonophenotype, time to achieve CR) was found to influence the long-term outcome. We conclude that autologous transplantation of non-cryopreserved bone marrow after CAV conditioning is feasible for adults with high-risk ALL. The method is characterized by fast recovery, short hospital stay and low non-relapse mortality, and may constitute good alternative to autologous PBSCT.",
