    "abstract_text": "Erythroid differentiation recapitulates the temporal switch from \u03b3 to \u03b2-globin gene expression that occurs during fetal development. We and others have demonstrated a p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent mechanism for \u03b3-globin activation by fetal hemoglobin inducers in the setting of permissive chromatin structure. Furthermore, by electrophoretic mobility shift assay we confirmed that CREB and ATF-2 bind the CRE at nucleotide \u22121222 in the G\u03b3-promoter (G-CRE). A naturally occurring C\u2192G mutation in the CRE occurs is associated with the Benin haplotype, producing lower fetal hemoglobin levels in sickle cell patients. To understand the functional relevance of the G-CRE we used a luciferase reporter system established with promoter mutants at nucleotides \u22121500, \u22121350 and \u22121180 to produce the respective reporters -1500G\u03b3luc, \u22121350G\u03b3luc and \u22121180G\u03b3luc. Transient transfections were performed in K562 cells by electroporation. In the \u22121180G\u03b3luc reporter there was a loss of the 15 to 20-fold activation induced by 2mM butyrate and 0.5\u03bcM trichostatin in the \u22121500G\u03b3luc reporter . The loss of trans -activation when the G-CRE was deleted in the \u22121180 mutant confirms functional relevance for this element. Trans -activation studies were also completed with a wtCREB (pCMV-CREB) and dominant negative, pKCREB expression vector. The latter forms an inactive heterodimer with CREB by blocking the DNA binding domain. To determine the direct trans -activation potential of wtCREB, co-transfection studies were completed with 10 to 40\u03bcg of either pCMV-CREB or pKCREB alone. We observed a dose-dependent 1.5 to 11-fold increase in luciferase activity with wtCREB compare to a robust 18 to 100-fold G\u03b3-promoter induction by pkCREB. This ability of both vectors to activate was reversed when the G-CRE was deleted. Interestingly, when an equal concentration of both vectors was co-transfected, a 40-fold increase in promoter activity was observed. Additional studies with pkCREB and butyrate or trichostatin inductions produced a similar synergistic effect. Collectively, the findings suggest that other transcription factors with greater trans -activation potential bind the G-CRE when CREB is inactivated by its dominant negative protein. We will test the two most likely candidate transcription factors, cJun and ATF-2 which bind the G-CRE and are downstream effectors of p38 MAPK signaling. Transfection experiments with cJun confirmed a dose-dependent 80-fold activation of \u22121500G\u03b3luc. Interestingly, when cJun was combined with wtCREB, \u03b3-promoter trans -activation dropped 60-fold supporting two possible interactions between cJun and CREB: 1) competitive binding to the G-CRE or 2) the formation of an inactive or low activity heterodimer between the two proteins. Additional studies with site-directed mutants of the G-CRE will be performed to ferret out the DNA-protein interactions in this region, thereby providing gene-based approaches for fetal hemoglobin induction.",
