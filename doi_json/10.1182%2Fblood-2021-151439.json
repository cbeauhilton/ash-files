    "abstract_text": "Background: The use of immunotherapeutic agents in multiple myeloma (MM) has shown improvements in clinical outcomes, emphasizing the role the host immune system plays in disease control. In recognition of this relationship, efforts aimed at identifying biomarkers of immune surveillance in MM have identified prognostic value in the peripheral absolute lymphocyte (ALC) and absolute monocyte (AMC) counts at various stages of disease and following autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), with lower ALC and AMC serving as a surrogate for immune dysregulation and correlating with inferior progression free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). With ASCT remaining the standard of care in the treatment of MM, we sought to examine whether CD3 content of the apheresis product during stem cell collection could be used as a biomarker for immune competence and whether it influences outcomes. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 1086 MM patients who underwent stem cell (CD34) collection with available CD3 data and subsequent ASCT at our institution. We recorded the total absolute CD3 and CD34 cell count upon completion of mobilization, with a higher CD3 count serving as a surrogate for immune competence. In addition to investigating the absolute CD3 count, we calculated the CD3/CD34 ratio given variation in the CD34 goals. Patients were dichotomized based on whether their absolute CD3 and CD3/CD34 ratio values were above or below medians. A Kaplan-Meier model was used to compare median PFS and OS between groups. A cox proportional hazards model was used to determine its prognostic impact, adjusting for ISS stage 3, high risk FISH, achievement of CR near day 100, and maintenance therapy received post-ASCT. Results: The median length of follow-up from date of ASCT for the entire cohort (N=1086) was 34.1 months (range: 0.26-157 months) and the median time from stem cell collection to ASCT was 9 days (range: 3-3143 days). The most common mobilizing regimen was Neupogen and plerixafor (N=425, 39%) and 694 (64%) patients received ASCT in the first line setting. The median absolute total CD3 count was 4.3 x 10^6/kg (range: 0.1-21.9) with 542 patients above and 544 patients at or below the median. The median absolute total CD34 count was 8.53 x 10^6/kg (range: 0.2-37.0) and median CD3/CD34 ratio was 0.50 (range: 0.01-15), with 536 patients above and 550 patients at or below the median ratio. The median PFS among patients with a CD3 count > 4.25 x 10^6/kg was 23.1 vs. 16.9 months among patients with CD3 count \u2264 4.25 x 10^6/kg (p 0.5 (Figure 1). The prognostic value among patients with a CD3/CD34 ratio > 0.5 was retained after adjusting for ISS stage III, high risk FISH features, and use of maintenance therapy as follows: PFS HR: 0.73 (95% CI: 0.62-0.86; p=0.0002); OS 0.71 (95% CI: 0.59-0.88; p=0.001). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that patients who have higher CD3 content in their apheresis product have better PFS and OS following ASCT. These findings reveal a possible role for using absolute CD3 and CD3/CD34 ratios in the apheresis product as a surrogate marker for immune competence and in predicting clinical outcomes.
