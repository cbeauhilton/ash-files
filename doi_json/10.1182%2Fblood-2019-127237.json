    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the Western hemisphere. Patient characteristics and burden of FL are incomplete and vary from previous studies. This study evaluated patient profile, including patient characteristics, treatment patterns, and duration using real-world data. Methods: Using the Truven MarketScan\u00ae databases, patients with FL who were newly initiated with FL indicated regimens were identified from 1/1/2010-12/31/2013 (initial treatment identification period). Patients were selected if they were \u226518 years old, had 1 FL ICD-9 code (202.0) as primary or secondary diagnosis, at least 1 FL commonly prescribed systemic anti-cancer therapy after the diagnosis, and did not use any FL indicated regimen in the past 6 months prior to first agent included in the initial treatment identification period. These patents were followed \u22653 months or to June 30, 2018. Primary outcomes were the distribution of regimens by line, the number of patients who switched from first- to second-line therapies, and from second- to third-line therapies. The treatment duration by line of therapy and regimen were also analyzed. Discontinuation was defined as 3 months without receiving a regimen after treatment. Results: This study identified 4,970 patients who initiated treatment for FL. Of these patients, 48.1% were female (n=2,390), with a mean age of 62.0 (SD: 14.0) years. The average follow-up time was approximately 2 years (median: 733 days). In this analysis, 4,970 patients with FL received first-line therapy for 153 days (median: 94 days), 1,985 received second-line therapy (39.9% of patients who received first-line therapy) for 208 days (median: 80 days), and 664 received third-line therapy (13.4% of patients who received first-line therapy) for 117 days (median: 43 days). Of the 4,970 patients on first-line therapy, 453 (9.1%) remained on first-line therapy, 2,532 (51.0%) discontinued treatment, and 1,985 (39.9%) patients switched to the next line of therapy during the follow-up period. Of the 1,985 patients who switched to second-line therapy, 328 (16.5%) remained by the end of follow-up period, 993 (50.0%) discontinued, and 664 (33.4%) switched to the next line of therapy during the follow-up period. Of the 664 patients who switched to third-line therapy, 125 (18.8%) remained, 269 (40.5%) discontinued, and 270 (40.7%) switched to the next line of therapy. The most common first-line regimens in descending order received by patients were rituximab (n=1,478, 29.7%), R-CHOP (n=1,368, 27.5%), BR (n=1,050, 21.1%), R-CVP (n=371, 7.5%), and FCR (n=63, 1.3%). Second-line treatment regimens were (N=1,985) rituximab (n=992, 50.0%), BR (n=202, 10.2%), R-CHOP (n=138, 7.0%), and R-CVP (n=120, 6.1%). Third-line treatment regimens were (N=664) rituximab (n=228, 34.3%), BR (n=91, 13.7%), R-CHOP (n=75, 11.3%), cyclophosphamide (n=35, 5.3%) and R-CVP (n=31, 4.7%). Conclusion: This data set describes the percentage of patients that transition from first- to second-line and second- to third-line treatment for FL. The primary regimens used across the treatment lines conform to those recommended by the NCCN guidelines. In addition, smaller numbers of non-recommended regimens were reported.
