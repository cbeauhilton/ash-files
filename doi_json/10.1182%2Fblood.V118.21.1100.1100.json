    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1100 Large granular lymphocytes(LGL)which may be of T or NK phenotype, normally account for 10\u201315% of peripheral blood(PB)lymphocytes. T-LGL leukemia is a clonal expansion of antigen-primed competent cytotoxic-T-lymphocytes(CTL)which is unique in that these cells retain many phenotypic and functional properties of normal cytotoxic effector T cells. Sphingolipid-mediated signaling has been shown to have a role in long-term survival of CTLs. The diagnosis of T-LGL leukemia requires proof of clonality, yet clonal T-LGL proliferations may occur in normal individuals with autoimmune diseases, viral infections, B cell lymphoproliferations and post bone marrow transplantation rendering the differentiation of malignant (leukemic) from benign LGL expansions at times difficult. It has been suggested that T-LGL proliferations with polyclonal or oligoclonal TCR gene rearrangement may be a response to a stimulus before the emergence of a dominant clone. Gaucher disease (GD)is a lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding acid \u03b2-glucocerebrosidase, leading to the accumulation of glucocerebroside in tissue macrophages (Gaucher cells) and resulting in hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias and skeletal involvement. GD and T-LGL leukemia share strikingly similar clinical features, including cytopenias, splenomegaly, B cell dyscrasias, arthralgias, pulmonary hypertension (PHT), and increased association with neoplasms and autoimmune disorders. The etiology of PHT, B cell dyscrasias, and the increased frequency of neoplasms in GD remains unclear. Table 1 describes the characteristics of 4 GD patients suffering from severe cytopenias relative to the overall phenotype of their GD in whom LGL were found to comprise the majority of the PB lymphocytes. Patient #1: 31year-old female suffering from severe GD with massive splenomegaly and severe cytopenias but refuses Gaucher-specific therapy; Patient #2: 31year-old female has suffered from severe Gaucher disease since childhood, was splenectomized, has unexplained anemia and known LGL expansion for 7 years but clonality studies continue to be negative; Patient #3: 45 year-old female with severe GD, splenectomized, suffered from AVN, bone crisis autoimmune hemolytic anemia, PHT, and B cell dyscrasia; and Patient #4: 72 year-old male has asymptomatic GD with progressive pancytopenia who was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome(MDS),T-LGL proliferation and monclonal gammopathy of unknown origin(MGUS). LGL cells comprised 70% of PB lymphocytes in addition there was severe trilineage dysplastic changes, TCR rearrangement was positive. Interestingly, 8 months after the start of enzyme replacement therapy(ERT),counts improved and the number of PB LGL was reduced to <10% of lymphocytes. In a cohort of 55 consecutive GD patients, 38% had LGL expansions in the PB smears. Since both conditions may be asymptomatic for many years, their co-existence can easily be missed.

We suggest that LGL expansions in GD may be reactive to glucocereborside accumulation in Gaucher cells, and may play a pathogenic role in the development of some of the features of GD as well as induce/exacerbate some associated disorders.
