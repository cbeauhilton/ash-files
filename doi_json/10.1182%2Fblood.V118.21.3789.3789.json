The treatment of patients with chronic phase (CP) Ph-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with imatinib has resulted in high rates of cytogenetic and molecular responses. There are evidences that the achievement of CCyR and MMR to imatinib therapy is related with Imatinib plasma level (IPL) in some studies1,2 but not in others 3. T his discrepancy may be possibly explained by the heterogeneity in the analysed cohort patients differing with respect to the phase of the disease and imatinib dose. The Aim of our study was to elucidate the trough role of IPL in the achievement of CCyR in homogeneous cohort of CP CML patients. Methods. IPL were detected in 321 CP CML patients with Imatinib treatment duration more than 12 months (the median \u2013 90,3). Imatinib doses was 400 mg QD. The age of patients was 54,6 (24\u201376). Male/female ratio was 157/164. All patients gave informed consent before blood sampling. Blood samples were collected in 21\u201327h after the last Imatinib dose intake. Imatinib concentrations (C trough) were determined by validated LC/MS/MS method. Results. The patients were subdivided in 4 quartiles (Q): Q1 (n=81) with IPL 0 \u2013 670 ng/ml, Q2 (n=80) with IPL 671 \u2013 1042ng/ml, Q3 (n=80) with IPL 1043 \u2013 1362ng/ml, Q4 (n=80) with IPL 1363 \u2013 3826/ml. The results of imatinib treatment in each quartile were estimated according ELN recommendation. The obtained findings have shown that 48,1% CP CML patients in Q1 have achieved CCyR whereas 77,5%, 81,3% and 85% - in Q2,Q3 and Q4 respectively ( Fig.1. ). Fig. 1.

Our findings show that the achievement of CCyR in large cohort of CP CML patients (n=321) on imatinib with 400 mg/QD depends on IPL. The low level of IPL may indicate the nonadherence of some CML patients as well as some intrinsic mechanisms of imatinib plasma concentration decrease.
