We analyzed the data of 255 consecutive patients (median age: 26) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in their first or second remission (CR1 or CR2) after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Results. Three parameters were found to be predictive of outcome: response after induction therapy, WBC count at diagnosis, and cytogenetics. These three factors were combined to yield two risk groups. The 2-year cumulative incidences of relapse for patients at low and high risk were 8% and 36% (p = 0.001), respectively. The three-year probabilities of leukemia-free survival (LFS) for these two groups were 80% and 52% (p = 0.001), respectively. Multivariate analysis for relapse and for LFS showed that not achieving CR after 2 courses of therapy was the strongest independent prognostic factor (p=0.001, and p=0.019, respectively). In addition, in a subgroup of patients with quantification of minimal residual disease (MRD) at the time of HSCT, positive MRD at this time point was correlated with a poor outcome. Conclusions. Our results suggest that the index is simple and predictive, so it might be applied to assist with risk-directed post-transplant therapy for young patients with AML in CR who have received myeloablative haploidentical HSCT.
