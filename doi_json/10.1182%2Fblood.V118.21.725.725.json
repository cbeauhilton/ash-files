    "abstract_text": "Abstract 725 Directional migration is an important factor that determines homing of transplanted hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). The SDF-1\u03b1-CXCR4 axis is one of the most important determinants of this process. CD26, expressed on various cell types, leads to proteolytic cleavage of SDF-1\u03b1, which leads to the inactivation of its chemokine activity. We identified tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) as an inhibitor of CD26. Culture of murine bone marrow derived c-kit + Lin \u2212 Sca-1 + (KLS) cells or human umbilical cord blood derived Lin \u2212 CD34 + cells with TFPI significantly inhibited CD26 activity, which resulted in significantly increased migration towards SDF-1\u03b1. Moreover, TFPI treatment of murine KLS cells led to significant improvement in homing following intravenous injection and long-term reconstitution upon transplantation in competitive repopulation assays. We found that the effects of TFPI were mediated by the heparan sulphate proteoglycan, Glypican-3 (Gpc3). TFPI directly bound Gpc3; TFPI did not affect CD26 activity, migration or homing of Gpc3 \u2212/\u2212 KLS cells, but affected Gpc1 \u2212/\u2212 KLS cells similar to the wild type. Finally, KLS cells from Gpc3 \u2212/\u2212 but not Gpc1 \u2212/\u2212 mice homed significantly less following IV injection. Hence, we present a novel molecule that can be used in an HSC specific manner to enhance HSC migration, homing and engraftment. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
