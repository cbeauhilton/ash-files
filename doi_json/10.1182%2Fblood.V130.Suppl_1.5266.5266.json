    "abstract_text": "Introductio n. Evidences indicate that megakaryocyte/platelet lineage is crucial in BCR-ABL negative MPN, especially in myelofibrosis (MF) induction. Monocyte/Macrophage lineage were also reported to play a significant role . These Monocyte /Macrophage studies were on the blood monocytes such as have increased the intermediate forms of monocytes (CD14 + CD16 + ) and Substance P in MF , but in the bone marrow these cell lineages were not studied. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) have been classified into two subsets. as the M1 subset (CD86 + ) which produces Th1 cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and pro-inflammatory cytokines. They are involved in the host defense against different pathogens and play a role in the anti-tumor immunity. The M2 subset, that secretes IL-10 and other iimmunosuppresive cytokines and are identified as CD206 + (in vitro induced by IL4) or CD163 + (IL10). These M2 macrophages are associated with tumor progression and metastasis. Myeloid suppressor cells (MDSC ) also were found abundantly in the tumor matrix. We previously reported an increase in MDSC in the peripheral blood of BCR-ABL(-) MPN, therefore, these cells were also studied. Material and Methods: Patient and sample preparation: Peripheral blood, bone marrow (BM) aspirate and biopsy were obtained and used in isolation for mononuclear cells (MNCs). 11 MPN patients consisting of 5 ET, 1 PV , 2 PMF, 1 ET-MF, and 2 PV-MF were studied along with 5 controls ,including 4 questionable spike on protein electrophoresis with normal bone marrow exminations and one with leukemoid reaction . Flow cytometric quantification of monocytes, TAMs and MDSCs MNCs from peripheral blood or BM (aspirates and biopsy) were incubated (1X10 6 /ml) with fluorophore-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against the following markers (CD14, HLA-DR, CD86, CD163, and CD206; BD Bioscience, Inc.) The raw flow data were analyzed using FlowJo (v 7.6.2).Thecell populations were gated and identified with the following immunophenotypes: CD14 + HLA-DR -/low as the Mo-MDSCs , CD14 + CD86 + as M1 macrophage, and CD14 + CD206 + or CD14 + CD163 + as M2 TAMs . TAM or Mo-MDSC cells were presented in MFIs, as well as their percentages of total gated MNCs. Results: 1) Mo-MDSC were significantly elevated in MPN compared to that of controls both in the bone marrow aspirates and in the biopsy specimens (Fig1); 2) No difference was identified in M1 macrophages between MPN and controls in the percentage of total gated cells or by the MFI (data,not shown); 3) No difference was noted in M2 macrophages between MPN and controls in the percentage of total gated cells (Fig 2a) or by the MFI (Fig 2b). Conclusions: Mo-MDSC are increased in the bone marrow aspirates and biopsy specimens of patients with BCR-ABL(-) MPN. No difference was noted in the M1 and M2 TAM macrophages between the MPN and control. View large Download slide View large Download slide  Close modal Disclosures Wang: Celgen: Research Funding.",
