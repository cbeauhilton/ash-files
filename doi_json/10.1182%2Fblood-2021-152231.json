    "abstract_text": "Background Brentuximab vedotin (BV) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a CD30-directed monoclonal antibody, a protease-cleavable linker, and the microtubule-disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). Direct cytotoxicity, driven by MMAE, is at the heart of the multifaceted anticancer activity of BV (Sutherland 2006). BV was the first ADC to be approved in multiple cancer types, including treatment-na\u00efve Stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (AVD) (Connors 2017). Nivolumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that targets programmed cell death protein 1 and is approved for the treatment of adults with relapsed/refractory (R/R) cHL. Both agents have been well tolerated with encouraging activity when combined with multi-agent chemotherapy. BV plus nivolumab was evaluated as a frontline treatment option for patients with cHL who are \u226560 years of age and ineligible for, or declined, conventional combination chemotherapy. The ongoing study reported an objective response rate (ORR) of 82% in 11 evaluable patients, and BV appears to be well tolerated in this population (Friedberg 2018). The combination of BV and nivolumab produced a 67% complete response (CR) rate and an estimated 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 77% in 93 patients with R/R cHL treated in the first-line salvage setting (Advani 2021). BV plus doxorubicin and dacarbazine (AD) without radiation therapy was evaluated in 34 patients with non-bulky Stage I or II cHL. BV-AD treatment resulted in interim and end of treatment (EOT) CR rates of 94% and 97%, respectively. The 4-year PFS and overall survival (OS) estimates were 91% and 100%, respectively. Peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN) was low grade and only 1 patient had persistent PSN at the last follow-up (Abramson 2021). Part C of this study will evaluate BV, nivolumab, doxorubicin, and dacarbazine (AN+AD) in patients with Stage I or II cHL without bulky disease, a patient population similar to that studied in Abramson 2021. Based on the results of the trials summarized above, it is reasonable to expect that the combination of AN+AD will result in high response rates and be well tolerated, with potentially less toxicity compared with A+AVD. Study Design and Methods SGN35-027 (NCT03646123) is an open-label, multiple part, multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial of BV in patients with Stage III or IV cHL evaluating the efficacy and safety of A+AVD when administered with growth factor prophylaxis (Part A). Part B will evaluate the combination of AN+AD in patients with Stage I or II cHL with bulky mediastinal disease or Stage III or IV cHL. Part C will evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of AN+AD in patients with Stage I or II cHL without bulky disease. The primary objective of Parts B and C is to estimate the CR rate at EOT in patients with treatment-na\u00efve cHL. Approximately 240 patients will be enrolled in this study: 40 in Part A, 50 in Part B, and 150 in Part C. Parts A and B have completed enrollment. Patients in Part C must have histologically confirmed cHL and have an ECOG performance status of \u22642. Patients with nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL or prior treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors will be ineligible for enrollment. Patients in Part C will be treated with BV 1.2 mg/kg, nivolumab 240 mg, doxorubicin 25 mg/m 2 , and dacarbazine 375 mg/m 2 , administered separately by intravenous infusion on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Patients in Part C will receive 4 cycles of treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint is the CR rate at EOT with AN+AD in patients with previously untreated cHL. Duration of response, duration of complete response, event-free survival, PFS, ORR, and safety and tolerability of AN+AD will be evaluated as secondary endpoints. Efficacy will be assessed by PET/CT scans at Cycle 2 and EOT; disease response and progression for Part C will be assessed using the LYRIC modification of the Lugano Classification Revised Staging System for nodal non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas (Cheson 2014). Patients will be followed for disease progression and OS for 5 years. Safety and efficacy endpoints will be summarized with descriptive statistics. The CR rate at EOT and its two-sided 95% confidence interval will be presented (Clopper 1934). Time-to-event endpoints will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Enrollment for Part C is ongoing in the US, with plans for global expansion.
