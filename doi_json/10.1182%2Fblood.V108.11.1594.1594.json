    "abstract_text": "Several mouse models for sickle cell disease have been developed for the studies of the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease and the investigations of drug and gene therapies. In previous years, we have also succeeded in producing a sickle cell anemia mouse model. In this model the endogenous mouse \u03b1 and \u03b2 globin genes were knocked out and replaced by the human \u03b1 and \u03b2 s globin transgenes. The \u03b2 s globin gene is contained in a 240kb YAC that preserves the entire native genomic context of the \u03b2-globin locus. These mice have anemia, reticulocytosis and irreversible sickle cells in the peripheral blood, as well as other pathological features of sickle cell disease. However, their \u03b3 globin switches to \u03b2 s globin expression from around 12 days of gestation. The low level of fetal hemoglobin expression in utero led to intrauterine sickling and fetal death so that very few live-born sickle cell anemia mice could be obtained. To rescue these mice from intrauterine death we investigated the effect of placing the pregnant mothers into a high O 2 environment. From the tenth day of gestation onwards, we placed the mothers into a chamber containing 50% O 2 and kept the newborn pups in it for another 10 days after birth. The frequency of sickle cell anemia mice we obtained was increased from 0.2% to 32%. Moreover, 55% to 88% of the newborn sickle cell anemia mice survived in the oxygen treated group, whereas none of the sickle cell anemia mice survived in regular air breeding conditions. The survived sickle cell anemia mice develop congestion, atrophy, and infarcts in multiple organs by histological analysis. These pathological finding are very similar to those find in patients with sickle cell disease. We conclude that a high oxygen environment can be used to obtain more sickle cell anemia mice in those models that have a high perinatal mortality. The higher yield of these mice will facilitate physiological and therapeutic studies of sickle cell anemia."
