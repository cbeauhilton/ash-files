    "abstract_text": "Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is a known modifier of sickle cell disease (SCD) severity. KLF-1 is a regulator of the globin switch. It does so by increasing beta-globin production and up-regulating BCL11A, a repressor of HbF synthesis. Pomalidomide, a second generation immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), regulates HbF and F-cell production during erythropoiesis in human CD34+ cells. The mechanism by which pomalidomide enhances F-cell production is not well understood. In this study, CD34+ cells were obtained after purification of peripheral blood and positive selection and cultured using a three-phase in v itro liquid culture system which recapitulates erythropoiesis, including terminal differentiation and enucleation, in the presence of no drug, pomalidomide, hydroxyurea, or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; vehicle control). Erythroid differentiation was assessed morphologically and by flow cytometry using the transferrin receptor and glycophorin A as markers of erythroid maturation. Flow cytometry was used to quantify F-cells. RT-qPCR was used to quantify mRNA expression of BCL11A, KLF-1 , and gamma-globin. Western blot was used to measure the total expression levels of BCL11A. In this culture system pomalidomide increased F-cells more than hydroxyurea in both SCD and normal control erythroid cultures. There was a significant decrease in BCL11A expression levels, a repressor of HbF synthesis, with pomalidomide but not with hydroxyurea. This decrease was seen in both SCD and normal samples. KLF-1 was not affected by pomalidomide. These findings suggest a very different mechanism of action for pomalidomide versus hydroxyurea in increasing F-cell production. Pomalidomide appears to target the erythroid specific BCL11A but not the more pleiotropic transcription regulator KLF-1. Since the F-cell production was augmented in the presence of pomalidomide in controls as well as SCD erythroid cultures this study suggests a role for pomalidomide in the pharmacologic augmentation of fetal hemoglobin levels, perhaps in addition to hydroxyurea, not only in SCD but in any beta-hemoglobinopathy.
