    "abstract_text": "Background. Prospective study based on measuring the left ventricular ejection function (LVEF) of lymphoma patients treated with rapid infusion Rituximab (one hour). Patients and Methods. 42 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma were treated with rapid infusion Rituximab-based chemotherapy (mostly CHOP-R). Basal LVEF was measured before chemotherapy and every six months after treatment. Results. An average of 6.5 infusions per patient were administered (total of 273 infusions). Twenty-four (57%) patients had at least one cardiovascular risk factor. In 13 patients (31%) we observed a decreased in the post-treatment LVEF of over 10%. Patients (3) with drop > 10% recovered normally, but when LVEF decreased by over 15% (6 patients), no one recovered until normal level. None of them developed clinical congestive failure. Conclusion. Rapid infusion Rituximab added to chemotherapy does not cause clinical cardiac toxicity. Patients recover LVEF when it decreased less than 15%."
