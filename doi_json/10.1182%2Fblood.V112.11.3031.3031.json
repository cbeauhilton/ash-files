    "abstract_text": "Background and objective Rivaroxaban \u2013 an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor \u2013 inhibits thrombus formation and growth in animal models. We have investigated the effects of rivaroxaban on thrombolysis because impaired fibrinolysis is a risk factor for venous thrombosis and it occurs more often in patients who had a myocardial infarction. As the propensity of a clot to be degraded depends on its structure, we tested the effects of rivaroxaban on clot structure and degradability by tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). This was done in the absence and presence of thrombomodulin because the thrombin - thrombomodulin complex is the activator of TAFI (thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor), a potent inhibitor of fibrinolysis. Methods Clots were formed in a microchamber in the presence or absence of rivaroxaban at pharmacological concentrations (0.15 and 0.25 \u03bcg/ml). Clot structure was analyzed by confocal microscopy, and permeability calculated by measuring flow rates. Degradation was evaluated by the amount of D-dimers in the eluate of clot perfused with t-PA, in the presence or absence of thrombomodulin. Results Microscopy showed that clots formed in the presence of rivaroxaban had thicker fibers and a looser fibrin structure with larger pores than controls, leading to increased permeation rate (Darcy constant 2.16-fold and 2.45-fold higher than controls with rivaroxaban at 0.15 \u03bcg/ml and 0.25 \u03bcg/ml, respectively). This clot structure modification renders the clots more susceptible to fibrinolytic enzymes. The degradation of clots containing 0.15 \u03bcg/ml of rivaroxaban was 3.6-fold higher than that of control clots, after 90 minutes perfusion with t-PA. In addition, when clots are formed in the presence of thrombomodulin, the degradability is decreased in control, while In the presence of rivaroxaban, fibrin degradation remains enhanced. Conclusion Rivaroxaban increased thrombolysis by t-PA. This was due to a decrease in thrombin generation. Two mechanisms are involved: modification of clot structure, which makes it more accessible to thrombolytic enzymes; and decrease in TAFI activation by the thrombomodulin\u2013thrombin complex. This property of rivaroxaban may contribute to its antithrombotic effect.",
