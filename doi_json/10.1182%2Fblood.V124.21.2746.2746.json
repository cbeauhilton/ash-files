    "abstract_text": "Introduction Germline mutations in GATA2 were recently identified as causative for several overlapping syndromes: MonoMAC (monocytopenia, mycobacterial infections), DCML (dendritic cells, monocytes, B and NK cells deficiency), Emberger syndrome (lymphedema, sensorineural deafness, multiple warts) and familiar myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Of note, GATA2 mutations were also found in children and young adults with \u201cprimary\u201d MDS. Aplastic anemia (AA) constitutes an important differential diagnosis to pediatric MDS, particularly in patients with normal cytogenetics. Because of heterogeneous phenotype of GATA2 mutated patients, defining a set of typical findings would help in their earlier identification and understanding the natural course of the disease. Therefore we aimed to analyze monocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations with the emphasis on B cell lineage by flow cytometry (FC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in all pediatric patients with GATA2 mutation diagnosed in the Czech Republic. Patients and methods Eleven pediatric patients were found to harbor GATA2 mutations in the Czech Republic so far. Three mutations were intronic. There was a clear male predominance (9/11). In 7 patients the disease manifested with MDS in childhood, 2 female patients were followed for immunodeficiency and developed MDS in adulthood. One another patient was diagnosed with interstitial lung disease and chronic EBV infection. His brother, carrying the same mutation, has mild neutropenia. Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples were analyzed by FC. The level of intronRSS-Kde recombination excision circles (KREC) and T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC) for assessment of proliferation history of B and T cells was examined by PCR. The control group comprised 26 GATA2 wild-type MDS (\u201cother MDS\u201d) patients and 36 AA patients. Results Disturbance of B cell compartment was the most frequently observed anomaly in the patients with GATA2 mutation. We observed a decrease of absolute and relative B cell numbers in PB and BM (n=9/11). In BM there was a decrease of immature CD10 pos B cells (n=10) with proportional increase of plasma cells. Peripheral blood B cell immunophenotype was shifted towards memory B cells (n=5/7). Presence of normal B cell precursors CD19 pos 10 pos 34 pos in BM was observed only in 1 patient in part of follow-up samples. Atypical malignant B lymphoblasts were present in another patient, whose MDS quickly progressed to AML with a clear switch to B lymphoid phenotype. Despite significantly reduced number of B cells the levels of IgG were normal in majority of patients. Only 2 patients had IgG hypogammaglobuliemia, in one patient with chronic active EBV infection IgG hypergammaglobulinemia was present. Slightly decreased IgA level was present in 6 patients. Although B cell numbers in other MDS control patients were significantly lower compared to AA, still the decrease was less prominent in comparison with GATA2 . The decrease of immature and naive B cells in patients with GATA2 mutation was reflected in very low level of KREC in PB and BM. Stored newborn dry blood spots from 4 patients were evaluated for TREC and KREC numbers. Strikingly, only one patient had negative KREC levels (the youngest patient from our cohort with MDS diagnosed at age 4). The remaining 3 patients had normal TREC and KREC levels at birth. Thus, the deterioration of de novo production of B cells occurred supposedly postnatally in most patients. Low KREC levels were also present in some patients with other MDS (n=5). Relative monocytopenia was found in 2 patients, low NK cells were present in 6 patients. T cells were mostly of naive non-activated phenotype. Conclusions Changes in B cell compartment are the most characteristic feature in patients with GATA2 mutation. Decreased number of B cells together with a shift towards mature phenotype and decreased level of KREC reflect history of substantial B cell proliferation in an environment of impaired production. This process appears to happen postnatally and resemble normal ageing process, which is accelerated due to progenitor cell impairment. Immunophenotyping is a useful tool in identifying patients for GATA2 sequencing.
