    "abstract_text": "In this session we will present results from our chemo-genomic screens designed to categorize more accurately human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subsets based on both their genetic make-up (RNA and exon Next Generation Sequencing) and their response to clinically-approved chemicals. The success of this project relies on our recent development of newly defined culture conditions that support the majority of leukemia stem cells in short-term cultures (Pabst et. al., submitted) and availability of a large collection of clinically annotated specimens (J.H., BCLQ). Integration of chemical and genetic data is possible through our novel bioinformatics tools developed for this purpose (Lemieux et. al., submitted). In addition to the generation of more accurate prognostic tools, these studies set the stage for drug repositioning and personalized medicine for human AML. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
