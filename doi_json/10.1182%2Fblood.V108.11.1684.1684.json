    "abstract_text": "We recently reported that when Sca-1 + c-Kit \u2212 bone marrow cells (BMCs) were co-cultured with fetal liver cells (FLCs) on laminin-coated dishes, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-expressing BMCs became completely adherent by day 3 and expressed albumin as assessed with immunochemistry and RNA-PCR (Yamada et al. , Exp Hematol. 34: 97, 2006). In the current study, we attempted to further delineate the characteristics of BMCs that differentiate into hepatic-like cells. It was found that AFP-expressing cells were in CD5 + or B220 + lymphoid lineage, mostly Sca-1 + CD5 + lineage, expressing AFP. When cKit + Sca-1 + lineage \u2212 BMCs (KSLs), which did not express AFP, were cocultured with CD5 + BMCs, both from green fluorescence protein (GFP)-expressing transgenic mice, in the presence of FLCs from ROSA26 mice (X-gal + FLCs), fractionated cells gave rise to adherent hepatic-like cells, which expressed albumin and cytokeratin 8 (assessed with immunochemistry) and AFP, albumin, transthyretin and dipeptidylpeptidase IV (examined with RNA-PCR). The hepatic-like cells from KSLs and CD5 + BMCs emerged at the frequency of 1 in 50 and 1x10 3 as assessed with titration assay. However, CD5 + Mac-1 \u2212 Gr-1 \u2212 Ter119 \u2212 BMCs did not differentiate into hepatic-like cells. CD5 + CD45 \u2212 cells differentiated into hepatic-like cells without fusion at the frequency of 1 in 300 but CD5 + CD45 + cells did not. CD5 + CD45 \u2212 cells hardly produced hematopoietic colonies as compared with CD5 + CD45 + cells did. In conclusion, we have shown that KSLs and CD5+ CD45\u2212 cells exposed to FLCs are capable of generating hepatic-like cells, which expressed albumin as assessed with immunochemistry and RNA-PCR. We should further explore whether CD5+ CD45\u2212 cells emerge from hematopoietic stem cells or mesenchymal stem cells.",
