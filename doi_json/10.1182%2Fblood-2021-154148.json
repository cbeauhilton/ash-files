    "abstract_text": "Background : CPX-351 is a dual-drug liposomal encapsulation of cytarabine(araC) and daunorubicin at a 5:1 molar ratio that is approved for treatment of newly diagnosed therapy-related AML or AML-MRC. Compared to 7+3, CPX-351 was associated with higher response rates (47.7% vs 33.3%) and improved overall survival (OS) in these patients. In an earlier phase I study, CPX-351 produced a CR/CRi rate of 23% in patients with R/R AML. Based on the activity of venetoclax (VEN) with lower intensity therapy in newly diagnosed AML, we investigated safety and efficacy of VEN combined with CPX-351 in pts with newly diagnosed (frontline) and R/R AML who are considered fit for intensive chemotherapy. Methods : The study was designed with a safety lead-in phase to establish the safe dose and schedule in R/R AML, followed by 2 expansion cohorts to explore efficacy in R/R AML (Cohort A) and frontline AML (Cohort B). Patients aged \u2265 18 years with adequate organ function, and ECOG PS \u22642 were eligible. Prior VEN use was allowed for pts with R/R AML. The dose of CPX-351 was fixed : daunorubicin 44 mg/m2 and cytarabine 100 mg/m2 IV on D1,3,5 of induction, and daunorubicin 29 mg/m2 + cytarabine 65 mg/m IV on D1,3 during consolidation. The starting effective dose of Ven was 300mg (at the -1 dose level) on D2-21 for the safety lead-in cohort. with appropriate dose adjustment for concomitant CYP3A inhibitors. Interruption of VEN after D14 was implemented if a D14 bone marrow (BM) was hypocellular and without evidence of leukemia. Results : A total of 31 patients were treated on the trial. 26 (84%) patients with R/R AML were treated on study: 12(46%) in the lead-in phase, and 14 (54%) in the expansion cohort (A). 5 (16%) patients with frontline AML were treated on expansion cohort B. Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Median number of prior treatments in R/R AML was 1 (range 1-7). Notably, 3 (60%) pts with frontline AML and 10 (42%) with R/R AML had a complex karyotype; 3 (60%) frontline AML patients and 6 (23%) R/R AML patients had TP53 -mutated AML. 4 of the 5 (80%) patients in the frontline cohort had treatment for a prior myeloid neoplasm before transforming to AML (treated secondary-AML). Among the 5 frontline AML patients, 4 (80%) achieved CR/CRi including 1 (20%) CR and 3 (60%) CRi. Of 26 R/R AML patients, there were 12 (46%) CR/CRi including 4(15%) CR and 8(31%) CRi. Rates of MRD negativity by flow cytometry were 75% and 78% in frontline and R/R AML, respectively. 4 out of 4 (100%) responding pts in the frontline AML cohort transitioned to SCT, and all are alive to date. 10 out of 12 responding patients in the R/R cohort (83%) underwent SCT. The 4- and 8-week mortality was 12% and 19% for the R/R cohort - all were patients with persistent AML; there were no early deaths in the frontline cohort (Table2). The median OS in frontline AML was not reached, compared to 7.1 months in R/R AML patients (Figure 1a). 1-year estimated OS was 75% (95% CI 13-96%) and 39% (95% CI 18-60%) in frontline and R/R AML, respectively. The median RFS was 6.7 months and 10.9 months in frontline and R/R AML, respectively (P=0.71; Figure 1b). Among R/R AML, the median OS in responding pts was 26.9 months (Figure 1d). Achieving MRD negativity was associated with better OS in R/R AML, with median OS of 26.9 months compared to 2.6 months in responders with detectable MRD (P=.061)(Figure 1c). Serious adverse events (SAEs) are summarized in Table 3. The most common grade 3/4 SAEs were infection NOS (19), pneumonia (7) and febrile neutropenia without source (4). Myelosuppression was universal. Grade 5 SAEs included 1 each of sepsis, pneumonia, intracranial bleed, and respiratory failure. Conclusion The combination of CPX-351 + 7 days of VEN was safe and tolerable, demonstrating encouraging rates of CR/CRi in adverse-risk frontline AML (80%) and R/R AML (52%), respectively. Median OS was not reached in frontline AML, and 7.1 months in R/R AML patients. 80% of frontline AML patients and 42% R/R AML patients overall successfully transitioned to SCT. Further investigation into efficacy in frontline AML and confirmation in R/R AML is planned.
