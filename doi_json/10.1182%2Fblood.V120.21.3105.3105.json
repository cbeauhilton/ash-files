    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3105 Background: EATL is a rare subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphomas characterized by primarily intestinal localization and a frequent association with celiac disease. The prognosis is considered to be poor with conventional chemotherapy. Limited data is available on the efficacy of ASCT in this lymphoma subtype. Primary objective was to study the outcome of ASCT as a consolidation or salvage strategy for EATL. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Eligible patients were > 18 years who had received ASCT between 2000\u20132010 for EATL that was confirmed by review of written histopathology reports, and had sufficient information on disease history and follow-up available. The search strategy used the EBMT database to identify patients potentially fulfilling the eligibility criteria. An additional questionnaire was sent to individual transplant centres to confirm histological diagnosis (histopathology report or pathology review) as well as updated follow-up data. Patients and transplant characteristics were compared between groups using X 2 test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and t-test or Mann-Whiney U-test for continuous variables. OS and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimate and compared by the log-rank test. Estimates for non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse or progression were calculated using cumulative incidence rates to accommodate competing risk and compared to Gray's test. Results: Altogether 138 patients were identified. Updated follow-up data was received from 74 patients (54 %) and histology report from 54 patients (39 %). In ten patients the diagnosis of EATL could not be adequately verified. Thus the final analysis included 44. There were 24 males and 20 females with a median age of 56 (35\u201372) years at the time of transplant. Twenty-five patients (57 %) had a history of celiac disease. Disease stage was I in nine patients (21 %), II in 14 patients (33 %) and IV in 19 patients (45 %). Twenty-four patients (55 %) were in the first CR or PR at the time of transplant. BEAM was used as a high-dose regimen in 36 patients (82 %) and all patients received peripheral blood grafts. The median follow-up for survivors was 46 (2\u2013108) months from ASCT. Three patients died early from transplant-related reasons translating into a 2-year non-relapse mortality of 7 %. Relapse incidence at 4 years after ASCT was 39 %, with no events occurring beyond 2.5 years after ASCT. PFS and OS were 54 % and 59 % at four years, respectively. There was a trend for better OS in patients transplanted in the first CR or PR compared to more advanced disease status (70 % vs . 43 %, p = 0.053 ). Of note, patients with a history of celiac disease had superior PFS (70 % vs . 35 %, p = 0.02 ) and OS (70 % vs . 45 %, p = 0.052 ) whilst age, gender, disease stage, B-symptoms at diagnosis or high-dose regimen were not associated with OS or PFS. Conclusions: This study shows for the first time in a larger patient sample that ASCT is feasible in selected patients with EATL and can yield durable disease control in a significant proportion of the patients. Patients transplanted in first CR or PR appear to do better than those transplanted later. ASCT should be considered in EATL patients responding to initial therapy.
