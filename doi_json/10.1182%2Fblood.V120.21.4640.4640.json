ITP, a diagnosis of exclusion, is characterized by low platelet counts and, depending on platelet count level, increased risk of bleeding (Rodeghiero F, et al. Blood. 2009:113(11):2386\u20132393). METHODS: An Excel \u00ae model compared 2011 US drug costs (wholesale acquisition cost) to the overall patient response rates (four or more weekly platelet counts of \u226550 \u00d7 10 9 /L during the study from week 2 to 25) observed in individual 6-month placebo-controlled trials for romiplostim, eltrombopag, and placebo (or Watch & Rescue) ( http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/12025/50715/50715.pdf ). These trials studied patients with median baseline platelet counts of 16 \u00d7 10 9 /L (in both the romiplostim and eltrombopag trials) with 51% of the eltrombopag and 64% of the romiplostim patients receiving \u22653 previous treatments prior to joining each respective trial (Kuter, D, et al. Lancet. 2008:371:395\u2013403; Cheng G, et al. Lancet. 2011:377:393\u2013402; Bussel, J, et al. Lancet. 2009:373:641\u2013648). The model considers a 55 mg daily dose of eltrombopag, and an average dose (including wastage) derived from a trial-based simulation for the US of 286 mcg per weekly administration of romiplostim. It assumes that 30% of US patients are splenectomized. The model considers a 1 g/kg overall dose of IVIg per rescue event at an average romiplostim trial-based weighted average (by splenectomy status) rate of 2.29 administrations per 6-month period (Weitz, I, et al. Curr Med Res Opin . 2012:28(5):789\u2013796). RESULTS: For romiplostim patients, the expected cost of treating a patient with romiplostim over a 6-month period (trial period) is $34,655, with an overall response rate of 83%, or a cost per patient with an overall response of $41,753 ($34,655\u00f783%). The expected 6-month cost of treating the same patient with eltrombopag is $28,516, for an overall response rate of 57%, or a cost per patient with an overall response of $50,028 ($28,516\u00f757%). Comparatively, the expected 6-month cost of treating the same patient with Watch & Rescue is $11,681, with an overall response rate of 9%, or a cost per patient with an overall response of $129,789 ($11,681\u00f79%). Patients treated with thrombopoietin receptor agonists experience a 48 to 74% higher overall response rates than patients treated with Watch & Rescue, at a 153 to 196% reduction in resources to achieve the response. Sensitivity analyses were performed on key variables; a \u00b150% change in the average 6-month cost of IVIg (from either a decrease in cost or a decrease in the average number of administrations) resulted in \u00b150% change in the Watch & Rescue cost per response ($64,894 to $194,683). A decrease of 25% to the response rates for romiplostim and eltrombopag individually resulted in a 33% increase in the overall cost per patient with an overall response to $55,670 for romiplostim and $66,704 for eltrombopag. CONCLUSIONS: In chronic adult ITP, the use of thrombopoietin receptor agonists represents an efficient use of healthcare resources, with better health outcomes at a significantly lower cost per treatment success than treatment with Watch & Rescue.
