    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1023 Background: The annual incidence rate of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in the general population is estimated at around 3\u20135/100,000. Because of a lack of specific therapies, until recently small attention has been devoted to costs of treatment of MDS. A specific Diagnosis-Related Group is still missing. In the US the mean annual cost for MDS patients ranges from $19,811 to $51,066. Aims: To assess the annual cost of illness (COI) and quality of life (QoL) of patients with MDS in Italy. Methods: The Co sto S ociale delle Sindromi Mi elodisplastiche e Q ualita\u0300 della vita in Italia (CoSMIQ) is an observational, cross-sectional, retrospective, prevalence-based, multicenter study based on an International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)-stratified sample of patients with MDS \u226518 years of age seen in standard clinical practice at 7 hematologic institutions across Italy (3 in the North; 2 in the Center; and 2 in the South). Demographics, clinical history, health care and non-healthcare resource consumption, and patients' and caregivers' productivity losses were collected by physicians using clinical records and information provided by patients. COI (in Euro (\u20ac) 2010) was determined utilizing a societal perspective. QoL was assessed via EORTC QLQ-C30 and QOL-E v.2 questionnaires, the latter being a new specific tool for the assessment of health-related QoL in patients with MDS. Kendall's tau rank correlation, chi-squared test, multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA; MANOVA) and multiple linear regressions were performed when appropriate. Results: In all, 225 of 234 patients who met the inclusion criteria were analyzed (IPSS low risk: 124 patients; intermediate-1 (Int-1) risk: 75 patients; Int-2 and high risk: 26 patients) ( Table ). The total COI reached \u20ac27,980.4 \u00b1 28,322.2 (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) ( Figure ). Cost-drivers of COI were antianemics (lower-risk) and antineoplastics (higher-risk). The Italian National Health Service (INHS) funded the greatest share of COI (from 97.4% to 99.5%). In general, CoSMIQ patients perform worse than the general population in all EORTC QLQ-C30 domains; the total global health status (QL) domain reached 65.1 \u00b1 22.2 (low risk: 64.2 \u00b1 22.3; Int-1 risk: 67.4 \u00b1 22.1; higher-risk: 62.5 \u00b1 22.3). QL was negatively correlated with COI (p=0.049) and patients' age (p=0.089), and positively correlated with disease duration (p=0.203). Keeping the other predictors constant, RBC transfusion dependence predicts increased COI (p=0.006) and lower QL (p=0.009). Regarding the QOL-E questionnaire, the QOL-E MDS-specific domain (MDSS) was positively correlated with total COI (p=0.0002), and patients' age (p=0.348) and negatively correlated with disease duration (p=0.013). The total QOL MDSS was 27.5 \u00b1 19.8 (low risk: 25.3 \u00b1 19.4; Int-1 risk: 29.6 \u00b1 19.3; higher-risk: 31.6 \u00b1 22.2). The total treatment-outcome index domain (QOL TOI) was 49.4 \u00b1 14.4 (low risk: 49.1 \u00b1 14.7; Int-1 risk: 48.3 \u00b1 14.7; higher-risk: 53.9 \u00b1 11.7). QOL TOI was negatively correlated with total COI (p=0.379), and patients' age (p=0.0003) and positively correlated with disease duration (p=0.162). Differences by IPSS group were not statistically significant for COI (p=0.191) or for any domain of the EORTC QLQ-C30 or QOL-E questionnaires (p=0.124; p=0.467). Conclusion: MDS dramatically increases INHS budgets while negatively impacting patients' QoL. The results of the CoSMIQ study highlight the strong correlation between RBC transfusion dependence and both COI and QL.
