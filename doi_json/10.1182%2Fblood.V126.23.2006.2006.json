    "abstract_text": "Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has been established as an effective treatment for patients with hematological malignancies. Disease relapse remains a major cause of transplant failure.T cell homeostasis is critical to determine the potency of the GVT effect. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4 or CD152) is a T cell activation negative regulator. Recent studies have shown the association of the CTLA-4 polymorphisms with the outcome after HLA-identical sibling allogeneic HSCT. Patients and Methods: In this study, we focused on four CTLA-4 polymorphisms, and analyzed the impact of donor genotypes and haplotypes on the conditions of 154 acute leukemia patients after related HLA-haplotype-mismatched transplantation. The four SNP genotypes (-1661, -318, CT60 and +49) were determined by TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. Results: Recipients of donors with +49 GG showed significantly lower OS (69.1% vs. 85.6%, P=0.024) and higher incidence of III-IV aGVHD (10.0% vs. 2.1%, P=0.032) than those with GA + AA(Fig.1,Fig.2). Multivariate analyses showed that +49GG was an independent risk factor for OS (HR:0.457,95%CI=0.227-0.920,P=0.028). Patients receiving mDLI showed significantly lower OS with +49 GG donor than those with AG+AA (P=0.011).The haplotype analysis revealed only three haplotypes in the donor population -1661/-318/CT60/+49 i.e.,ACGG,ACAA and GTGA,the frequencies were 64.3%, 19.5%, and 16.2%, respectively.Donors with and without the ACGG/ACGG haplotype had the same effect on transplant outcome as those with +49 GG and +49 AG+AA. Conclusion: The CTLA-4 +49 GG and the haplotype ACGG/ACGG reduced the overall survival and increased the aGVHD after allo-HSCT from the related HLA-haplotype-mismatched donor,knowledge of the CTLA-4 polymorphism and haplotype may provide useful information for donor selection and individual application of immunosuppressive agents and immunotherapy.
