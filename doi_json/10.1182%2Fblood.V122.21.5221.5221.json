    "abstract_text": "Iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is associated with complications, including a risk of cardiac disease and transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Iron chelation therapy (ICT) with deferasirox and desferrioxamine is an essential part of the management of iron overload in low and intermediate prognostic risk MDS patients [NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: Myelodysplastic Syndromes; Bennett 2008]. However, despite the risks of cardiac complications and AML, prior to 2009 there was little published evidence that ICT could improve survival outcomes in patients with MDS. A PubMed and ASH abstract search (conducted July 2013) has revealed a growing body of evidence indicating increased survival of a median of 2 \u2013 6 years in transfusion-dependent MDS patients treated with ICT, relative to patients without ICT (see Table ).

Pts: patients; ICT: iron chelating therapy; MDS: myelodysplastic syndrome; SC: Subcutaneous infusion; RA: Refractory anaemia; AML: acute myeloid leukaemia; OS: overall survival; IPSS: International Prognostic Scoring System; HR: hazard ratio; INT-1: intermediate-1; DFX: deferasirox; DFO: desferrioxamine; RARS: ring sideroblasts; SF: Serum ferritin; mths: months View Large All the published evidence for survival benefit is in lower IPSS risk MDS patients, with a significant survival benefit seen in the sub-group of patients with non-RARS (Leitch 2012). The main limitation of the studies is that they are all based on retrospective or prospective observational study designs; hence have a risk of selection bias, although many utilize multivariate techniques to control for confounding factors. Furthermore, none of the studies assess survival associated with type of ICT although there is an ongoing RCT (TELESTO) addressing the impact of deferasirox on OS in low risk MDS patients. In addition, it would be useful to explore whether the observational data from each study could be pooled to assess OS outcomes in transfusion-dependent lower risk MDS, by MDS sub-group and by type of ICT. In conclusion, there is now extensive evidence of an association between ICT and survival improvement in transfusion-dependent lower prognostic risk MDS patients.
