    "abstract_text": "Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide are sphingolipid metabolites and their intracellular balance impacts fate of normal and cancer cells; whereas S1P stimulates tumor cell migration, survival, proliferation and drug resistance, ceramide acts as endogenous pro-apototic factor. The role of S1P/ceramide pathway in myeloma has not been reported. Recent study demonstrated that thalidomide\u2019s antiangiogenic activity involves increased production of ceramide in microvessels ( Yabu et al., Blood 2005 ). In this study we tested the effect of S1P and ceramide on myeloma growth and determined the protective role of S1P against the inhibitory effect of thalidomide on myeloma cells. S1P (0.1\u201310 \u03bcM) stimulated growth of several human myeloma cell lines in serum-free media in time and dose dependent manners, reaching maximum response (>25%, p40% (p<0.001). Addition of S1P (1 \u03bcM) completely abrogated the inhibitory effect of metabolized thalidomide in all tested doses. We conclude that S1P is a myeloma survival and growth factor and protects myeloma cells from thalidomide-induced growth inhibition, presumably through counteracting increased ceramide activity by thalidomide. Pharmacological modulation of enzymes involved in regulation of the ceramide to S1P ratio and blocking S1P activity could constitute novel therapeutic approaches for treating and overcoming drug resistance in myeloma.",
