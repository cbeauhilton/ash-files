    "abstract_text": "Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by the abnormal production of various myeloid cells. Aberrant JAK2 signaling (e.g. induced by JAK2-V617F) plays an etiological role in MPN formation. While JAK2 inhibitors improve patient symptoms, they do not induce cell death as neoplastic cells appear to be rather insensitive to JAK2 inhibition and effectively rapidly become resistant to treatment. Therefore, the development of additional therapeutic approaches for MPNs is needed. Pim kinases are serine/threonine kinases that protect hematopoietic cells from apoptosis and also play a role in regulating hematopoietic stem cell growth. In mouse models, elevated Pim expression contributes to the development of lymphoma. Pims are constitutively active and thus regulated by protein expression, which is controlled by Pim gene expression and Pim protein stability. Pim1 gene expression is normally induced by JAK2/STAT5 signaling in response to extracellular growth factor stimulation, as Pim1 is a direct transcriptional target of STAT5. The deregulated JAK2 signaling in MPNs also induces Pim expression. STAT5 is required for MPN disease in mouse models, suggesting genes transcriptionally regulated by STAT5 are required for MPN disease formation. Together with the anti-apoptotic signaling and transforming properties of Pims, this suggests Pims may play a role in MPNs. We hypothesized that Pim kinases may offer a therapeutic target for MPNs and that Pim kinase inhibitors in combination with JAK inhibitors may cause neoplastic cytotoxicity, improving on current JAK2-inhibitor mono-therapy for MPNs. JAK2-V617F-dependentMPN model cells (HEL, SET2, Uke1, and BaF3/JAK2-V617F, including cells that are resistant to the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib) as well as MPN patient cells, were treated with Pim kinase inhibitors, SGI-1776 and AZD1208, and the JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib. The effects on cell growth, cell cycle, viability, and cell signaling were studied. High concentration SGI-1776 (10 \u03bcM) inhibited cell growth and viability of MPN model cells while lower doses (1 and 3 \u03bcM) had little effect on the growth and viability of these cells. Combination of 3 \u03bcM SGI-1776 with low dose ruxolitinib significantly enhanced growth inhibition and cell death of HEL and SET2 cells. Similar results were obtained with the much more effective and selective Pim inhibitor, AZD1208. We show that ruxolitinib inhibits Pim expression in MPN cells, and Pim expression is restored in ruxolitinib-resistant cells. Importantly, low dose SGI-1776 or AZD1208 (100 nM) re-sensitized ruxolitinib-resistant MPN cells to ruxolitinib treatment. Significantly, as single agents, both SGI-1776 and AZD1208 inhibited erythropoietin-independent erythroid colony formation of primary cells from MPN patients, but not erythroid colonies of normal controls. The combination of AZD1208 and ruxolitinib exhibited enhanced inhibition of colony formation of primary cells from MPN patients compared to treatment with either drug alone. These data indicate that Pim kinase inhibitors in combination with a JAK2 inhibitor may offer a more efficacious therapeutic approach over JAK2 inhibitor mono-therapy for MPNs.
