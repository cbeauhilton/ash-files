    "abstract_text": "Introduction: V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells immunotherapy is an emerging strategy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Partial effects of phosphoantigens like zoledronate, prompted us to investigate other molecules. Using V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells expanded from healthy volunteers, recent works of our team demonstrate that anti-BTN3A 20.1 agonist monoclonal antibody (mAb) improves V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo, including in zoledronate resistant blasts. Efficacy of anti-BTN3A 20.1 agonist mAb remains undetermined using autologous V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells and mechanism of its action on AML blasts is understudied. Material and methods: Expression of co-stimulatory molecules on surface of AML blasts and V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells, from 37 PBMC of AML patients, was assessed by flow cytometry. V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells expansion was realized from the same samples with zoledronate, and administrations of Il-2 and Il-15. Purity was assessed by flow cytometry at day 13. Degranulation assay was performed at day 14. Results: 20 degranulation assays were realized on successfully expanded V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells (69% of analyzable samples). Degranulation with anti-BTN3A 20.1 agonist mAb was enhanced compared to zoledronate condition (p=0.0085) or negative control (p<0.0001). We also show a positive correlation between level of degranulation and expression of DNAM-1 on V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells surface, exclusively under anti-BTN3A 20.1 agonist mAb treatment (rS=0.54; p=0.0134). Conversely, under zoledronate treatment, V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells degranulation was positively correlated with expression of NKG2D on V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells surface (rS=0.62; p=0.0099) and was inversely associated to their expression of PD-1 (p=0.0482). Conclusion: Efficacy of anti-BTN3A 20.1 agonist mAb on primary AML blasts is confirmed in an autologous setting. Degranulation seems to play a major role in enhancement of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells cytotoxicity under anti-BTN3A 20.1 agonist mAb treatment, where DNAM-1 could play a determinant role. An autologous strategy for V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells may be studied and considered in AML patients, with potent extrapolation to \u03b3\u03b4 T cell therapy protocols in targeting strategies.
