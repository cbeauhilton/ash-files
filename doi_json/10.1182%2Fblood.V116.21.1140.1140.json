    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1140 Introduction: Inorganic polyphosphates are negatively charged, linear phosphate polymers that influence hemostasis via accelerating factor V activation, triggering the contact pathway, and enhancing fibrin polymerization. The latter two effects require long-chain polyphosphates for optimal activity (>1000mers for activating the contact pathway and >250mers for enhancing fibrin polymerization). We explored whether short polyphosphates could inhibit the procoagulant effects of long polyphosphate polymers. Methods: Polyphosphate was size-fractionated by gel electrophoresis. \u201cLong-chain polyphosphate\u201d (LCP) was a heterogeneous polyphosphate preparation containing polymers ranging from 400 to several thousand phosphates long. Short-chain polyphosphate preparations were narrow fractions of homogeneous size. We also tested additional phosphate-containing molecules including ADP, ATP, monophosphate, pyrophosphate (PP i ), and triphosphate. Clotting assays were performed using pooled normal plasma spiked with 0\u201320 \u03bcM LCP and 0\u2013500 \u03bcM small (poly)phosphate; clotting was initiated by factor Xa plus CaCl 2 , or by CaCl 2 alone (contact pathway). Fibrin was formed by clotting 2.6 mg/ml fibrinogen with 10 nM thrombin in the presence of 0\u2013500 \u03bcM small (poly)phosphate plus 150 \u03bcM LCP and CaCl 2 . Results: Small polyphosphates (size range 23\u201383mer) reduced the ability of LCP to trigger the contact pathway of blood clotting, while monophosphate, PP i , triphosphate, ADP, and ATP all failed to influence the procoagulant activity of LCP. None of the small (poly)phosphates antagonized the ability of LCP to enhance factor V activation. Interestingly, monophosphate, PP i and triphosphate all inhibited the ability of LCP to enhance fibrin clot structure, with PP i being the most potent. Although ADP and ATP contain di- and tri-phosphates, they did not recapitulate the potent inhibitory activity of PP i . On the other hand, PP i had no measurable effect on the turbidity of fibrin clots formed in the absence of LCP. Conclusions: Short-chain polyphosphates inhibit the ability of LCP to initiate the contact pathway of coagulation. Platelet dense granules contain abundant PP i which is secreted in response to platelet agonists, although biological roles for platelet-secreted PP i are unclear. We propose that PP i is a novel modulator of fibrin clot structure, acting to regulate the effects of longer-chain polyphosphates on fibrin fibril formation.
