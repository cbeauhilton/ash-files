    "abstract_text": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of B cells for cellular immunotherapy, since B cell-based cancer vaccines have yielded promising results in preclinical animal models. Contrary to dendritic cells (DCs), we know little about the migration behavior of B cells in vivo. Therefore, we investigated the interactions between CD40-activated (CD40) B cells and cytotoxic T cells in vitro and the migration behavior of CD40B cells in vivo. The dynamic interactions of human antigen-presenting cells and antigen-specific T cells were observed by time-lapse videomicroscopy. The migratory and chemoattractant potential of CD40B cells was analyzed by flow cytometry and standard transwell migration assays. GFP + CD40B cells or CD40B cells isolated from Luciferase + mice were used for subsequent in vivo studies. Murine CD40B cells show similar migratory and chemotactic characteristics compared to human CD40B cells. Upon CD40-activation, B cells upregulate the important molecules involved in lymh node homing (CD62L, CCR7/CDCR4), which are functional and induce chemotaxis of T cells in vitro. Striking differences were observed for interactions of human CD40B cells or DCs with T cells. Antigen-loaded CD40B cells differ from immature and mature DCs by displaying a rapid migratory pattern undergoing highly dynamic, short-lived (7.5 min) and sequential interactions with cognate T cells. In vivo, CD40B cells migrate to the spleen and the lymph nodes, where they enrich in the B cell zone before traveling to B cell/ T cell boundary close to the T cell zone. CD40B cell interactions with T cells are dynamic and short-lived and thereby differ from DCs. Taken together, the migration behavior of CD40B cells and their interaction with T cells underline their potential as cellular adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy.
