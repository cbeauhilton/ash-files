    "abstract_text": "Introduction: While cure rates for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are approaching 90% with conventional chemotherapeutic regimens, certain high-risk patient subsets such as early T-cell precursor ALL (ETP-ALL) and Philadelphia Chromosome-like (Ph-like) ALL have an aggressive disease profile and poor prognosis. More recently whole genome and transcriptome sequencing of these high-risk subtypes have revealed several activating gene fusions, alterations and mutations that could result in constitutively activated tyrosine kinases (TKs). Activated TKs are then capable of phosphorylating downstream substrates and impacting several key signaling pathways, resulting in increased cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. Further, the highly heterogeneous nature of these subtypes, along with activating fusions/mutations, makes them refractory to standard chemotherapy. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop tailored therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these high-risk ALL subtypes. Recent advances in mass-spectrometry and the use of anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies for enrichment of tyrosine phosphorylated peptides have greatly facilitated characterization of the global tyrosine phosphorylation state in cancer cells and identified activated TKs that could be therapeutically targeted. Here we present the first study to quantitatively profile TK activity in xenografted patient biopsies of high-risk pediatric ALL. Methods: In this study, we have established an MS-based phosphotyrosine profiling approach in patient derived xenografts (PDXs) of high-risk pediatric ALL patients and integrated it with a spike-in SILAC quantitative tool to identify and quantify dysregulated TK activity across 16 PDXs. We further extended our study on markedly altered tyrosine phosphorylation in 4 PDXs to assess the therapeutic potential of specific TK inhibitors (TKIs). Immunoblots were performed to validate activated sites and their dephosphorylation upon TKI treatment. RT-PCR and Exome sequencing was carried out to detect novel fusion partners and point mutation sites to validate the activated TK profiles in these PDXs. In vitro cytotoxicity was assessed by mitochondrial metabolic activity assay (Alamar blue) following 48h drug exposures. PDXs were established from ETP-ALL, Ph-like ALL, B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL, or T-lineage ALL (T-ALL) bone marrow or peripheral blood (PB) biopsies in immune-deficient (NOD/SCID or NSG) mice. Engraftment and in vivo drug responses were assessed by enumeration of the proportion of human versus mouse CD45 + cells in the murine PB. Results: Using a quantitative phosphotyrosine profiling method in 16 PDXs, we mapped close to 1900 class I phosphosites with >0.75 localization probability and 99% confidence, of which 1394 tyrosine phosphorylated sites had a heavy SILAC partner that allowed quantification. Such profiling could accurately classify the leukemias into either T or B-cell lineages with the high-risk ETP and Ph-like ALL clustering as a distinct group. In particular, PDXs with activated tyrosine phosphorylation profiles of ABL1 , FLT3 and JAK were targeted with commercially available TKIs both in vitro and in vivo . Subsequent analysis to investigate the aberrant ABL1 and FLT3 signaling showed a NUP214-ABL1 translocation unique to BCP-ALL in one PDX, and a novel Y572S FLT3 mutation in another. Importantly, using a pre-clinical in vivo xenograft model, the activated JAK-STAT signaling observed in one ETP-ALL PDX was targeted with the JAK1/2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib, leading to a significant decrease in the leukemic blast population in the murine PB. Aberrant ABL1 kinase signaling indicated dasatinib treatment in a Ph + -ALL PDX and a PDX with high phospho-ABL1 (harboring the NUP214-ABL1 translocation), and a complete response and significant progression delay, respectively, were achieved in vivo . Similarly, the uniquely activated FLT3 in one PDX (Y572S mutation) correlated with an in vivo objective response to the multi-kinase inhibitor sunitinib. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the direct application of an unbiased and quantitative tool to identify aberrant TK signaling in high-risk ALL PDXs and highlights its potential to identify tractable drug targets.
