    "abstract_text": "Background: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is an important complication of thalidomide therapy especially when it is combined with corticosteroids or chemotherapy. Japanese patients with multiple myeloma (MM) are currently prescribed thromboprophylaxis after ASCO guideline, although there are limited data for asian population. We examined the incidence of DVT in Japanese patients with MM. Methods: We reviewed the records of 145 patients receiving thalidomide for newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory MM at Kameda Medical Center and Tsukuba Memorial Hospital during the 10-year period 1998\u20132008. Patients were considered to have developed DVT if they presented with suggestive symptoms of leg swelling and had a Doppler ultra-sound study confirming acute thrombosis. Results: 95 of the 145 patients received thalidomide in combination with a corticosteroid or other chemotherapeutic agents. 70 of 95 patients were prescribed thromboprophylaxis; of these, 53 patients received warfarin, 17 patients received aspirin during combination treatment. 38 of 70 patients were newly diagnosed. Only 1 of 70 patients (1.4%) developed DVT. None of the patients who were not received any prophylaxis developed DVT during combination treatment. Conclusion: The incidence of deep vein thrombosis is lower in Japanese patients with MM treated with thalidomide and corticosteroids or chemotherapy than previous report from western countries.",
