    "abstract_text": "Background: Somatic mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ( IDH1 ) are reported in 6-10% of patients (pts) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Ivosidenib (IVO; AG-120) is an oral, potent, targeted inhibitor of mutant IDH1 (mIDH1) approved for treatment of m IDH1 relapsed/refractory AML, and newly diagnosed (ND) AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy (IC). Here we report the genetic mutation and multiparameter flow analyses on longitudinal samples collected from pts receiving IVO + azacitidine (AZA) in the phase 1b portion of the ongoing phase 1b/2 study of mIDH1/2 inhibitors + AZA in pts with IC-ineligible ND AML (NCT02677922). Methods: Pts received oral IVO 500 mg daily continuously and subcutaneous AZA 75 mg/m 2 on Days 1-7 in 28-day cycles. The secondary efficacy endpoint of complete remission (CR) plus CR with partial hematologic recovery (CR+CRh) rate was sponsor derived, and CRh was defined as CR with absolute neutrophil count >0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L and platelets >50 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Genomic DNA from baseline and longitudinal bone marrow (BMMCs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were used for molecular studies. Co-occurring mutation profiling of 20/23 (14 CR/CRh) pts by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) using the ACE Extended Cancer Panel was performed, with 500\u00d7 average target coverage for the full coding region of 1400 genes (detection limit 2%). m IDH1 variant allele frequency (VAF) for 23/23 (16 CR/CRh) pts was also tested by a highly sensitive BEAMing digital PCR assay (detection limit 0.02-0.04%). Multiparameter flow cytometry was conducted centrally on bone marrow aspirate from 14/23 (12 CR/CRh) pts (detection limit 1%). Fisher's exact test (two-sided) was applied for statistical analysis. Results: As of February 19, 2019, 23 pts received IVO+AZA (11 male; median age 76 years [range 61-88]). Median duration of treatment was 15.1 months (range 0.3-32.2); 10 pts remained on treatment as of the data cutoff. Overall response rate was 78% (18/23 pts): CR 61% (14/23), CR with incomplete hematologic or platelet recovery 9% (2/23), and morphologic leukemia-free state 9% (2/23). CR+CRh rate was 70% (16/23). The top 3 most frequently co-mutated genes at study entry were RUNX1 (7/20 pts, 35%), SRSF2 (7/20, 35%), and DNMT3A (4/20, 20%). Given the small sample size, no gene or pathway identified at baseline was statistically associated with clinical response or resistance. Interestingly, CR/CRh was achieved in ND AML pt populations who typically have a poor prognosis, or did not achieve a CR/CRh response to single-agent IVO therapy: 3/3 pts with poor risk karyotypes (local cytogenetics), 1/2 harboring TP53 mutations, and 3/5 with RTK pathway ( KRAS , NRAS , PTPN11 ) mutations. Longitudinal mutation clearance (MC) of m IDH1 and the most frequent baseline co-mutations in CR/CRh and non-CR/CRh pts are summarized in the Table. IDH1 -MC in BMMCs was observed in 13/14 (93%) CR/CRh pts by NGS and in 11/16 (69%) by digital PCR. Utilizing the 2-log more sensitive digital PCR assay specific to m IDH1 , there was strong concordance in the m IDH1 VAF observed in BMMCs and PBMCs (Pearson correlation coefficient [r]=0.919) with 12/16 (75%) CR/CRh pts achieving MC in PBMCs, and 11/12 (92%) achieving MC in both BMMCs and PBMCs. These IDH1 -MC rates are higher than those previously observed in IC-ineligible ND AML pts treated with single agent IVO (Roboz et al. ASCO 2019; NCT02074839). Similarly, in CR/CRh pts with available baseline co-mutation data by NGS, all mutations were cleared in 11/14 (79%) pts, apart from mutations in the \"DTA\" ( DNMT3A / TET2 / ASXL1 ) genes typically associated with clonal hematopoiesis. In contrast, mutations in the \"DTA\" genes were cleared in 2/5 (40%) CR/CRh pts. Orthogonal evaluation of the depth of these remissions by flow cytometry found that 10/12 (83%) CR/CRh pts achieved measurable residual disease (MRD) negativity. Conclusion: Combination of IVO+AZA in IC-ineligible ND AML leads to a high rate of clinical response with molecular remissions. The strong association between MC, clinical response, and flow cytometry MRD in this phase 1b study warrants further investigation of single gene m IDH1 VAF as a biomarker for monitoring response in pts with m IDH1 AML treated with IVO+AZA. Furthermore, the high concordance of m IDH1 VAF between BMMCs and PBMCs indicates that peripheral blood could be a surrogate tissue for monitoring m IDH1 VAF in these pts.
