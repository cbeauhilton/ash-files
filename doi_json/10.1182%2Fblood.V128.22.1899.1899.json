    "abstract_text": "Introduction: In a developing country like Algeria, such expensive therapy is not available. Alternative approaches are needed to help these adult. In Algeria 'imatib' (CIPLA-India) was introduced in 2006; but no study has been published yet in the North Africa region regarding response and outcome of this copy in CML patients. The goal of this multicenter study is to characterize newly adult CML in the western region of Algeria and to assess the effectiveness and safety of imatib (IM, copy) as frontline therapy for patients with CML. Patients and Methods: The study was carried out in 7 hematology centers in the western Algeria. Patients, who were diagnosed to be suffering from CML between 1st January, 2007 and 31st December, 2014 were selected for data analysis. All patients received a copy preparation, consisting of the alpha crystal form of imatinib, (IM, copy) at a oral dose of 400 mg daily and monitored for tolerance and side effects while on therapy. Results: Between January 2007 and December 2014, 355 patients with CML were treated with imatib (copy). The median follow- up of the study was 46 months (range: 13-107 months). Complete hematological response (CHR) was seen in 83% of patients within 3 months. According to the Sokal score, 72% patients with low, 78% with intermediate and 69% with high risk disease achieved a CHR in 3 months (p=0.26) and according to the EUTOS score, 81% of patients with low and 70% with high risk disease achieved a CHR in 3 months (p=0.08). The major molecular response (MMR) at six months (M6), M9, M12, M18 and M24 was 21%, 38%, 35%, 51% and 67% respectively and 34% of patients achieved a complete molecular response (CMR). The projected 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 83%. Side effects of imatib (copy) in this study were similar to those reported previously for the entire imatinib mesylate treatment study and only 8% of patients were intolerant to imatib (copy) and treated with a second generation of BCR-ABL inhibitor. Conclusion: In conclusion, imatib (copy) is effective and safe in treating patients with CML in chronic phase and proves to have a durable outcome. To our knowledge this is the first study reporting the response to imatib (copy) in a Algerian population. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
