    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a specialized form of immunotherapy for treating patients with hematological malignancies. The curative potential is attributed to the graft-versus-tumor (GVT) response during which donor-derived cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) eliminate malignant cells of the recipient. Minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA) are the major targets of the GVT response, and expansion of MiHA-specific CTL has been shown to coincide with tumor remission following SCT. Recently, we identified a novel hematopoietic cell-restricted MiHA, designated LRH-1, which is presented by HLA-B7 and encoded by the P2X5 purinergic receptor gene ( J. Clin. Invest.  2005 : 115 : 3506 \u20133516 ). Interestingly, tetramer analysis showed a direct association between in vivo expansion of LRH-1-specific CD8+ T cells and the disappearance of Bcr-Abl positive tumor cells in the CML patient from whom LRH-1-specific CTL was originally isolated. In addition, we detected in vivo expansion of LRH-1-specific CTL in an AML patient who was in clinical remission without GVHD. Furthermore, we demonstrated that P2X5 mRNA is significantly expressed in leukemic CD34+ progenitor cells from most CML as well as AML patients. These findings indicate a role for LRH-1 in inducing GVT immunity against myeloid leukemic progenitor cells. Here, we investigated the ex vivo responsiveness of myeloid leukemic CD34+ progenitor cells to LRH-1-specific CTL. First, we addressed this question using the CD34+ KG1 cell line which is positive for LRH-1. By using a CFSE-based survival assay we demonstrated that KG1 cells stably transfected with HLA-B7 could be efficiently lysed by LRH-1-specific CTL. Next, we determined responsiveness of purified CD34+ progenitor cells from HLA-B7+ CML patients to LRH-1 CTL-mediated killing. In the CFSE-based survival assay as well as a hematopoietic progenitor cell inhibition assay we showed that LRH-1-specific CTL efficiently recognize and kill CD34+ progenitor cells from LRH-1+ CML patients. In contrast, LRH-1-specific CTL did not inhibit the proliferation of CD34+ progenitor cells from LRH-1- CML patients. These findings illustrate that the P2X5-encoded LRH-1 antigen is an attractive target for adequate eradication of myeloid leukemic progenitor cells after allogeneic SCT."
