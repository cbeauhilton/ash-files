    "abstract_text": "Many cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are associated with non-random chromosomal rearrangements and most of these result in fusions involving retinoic acid receptor \u03b1 (RAR\u03b1), CBF transcription factors, MLL, and nucleoporins. Here, we report the effects of key members of these four major groups of AML-associated chimeric fusion proteins on differentiation, proliferation, self-renewal and gene expression in primary human CD34+ hematopoietic cells. We expressed the PML-RAR\u03b1, AML1-ETO, MLL-AF9 and NUP98-HOXA9 fusion genes in human peripheral blood CD34+ cells by retroviral transduction and compared them to cells transduced with empty vector. By colony forming assays, morphological examination and flow cytometric immunophenotyping we found that PML-RAR\u03b1 causes some degree of myeloid differentiation block. AML1-ETO had no obvious effect on differentiation, while MLL-AF9 and NUP98-HOXA9 caused a block in both myeloid and erythroid differentiation. All fusion oncoproteins, except PML-RAR\u03b1, induced dramatic long-term proliferation in liquid culture and a marked increase in the numbers of primitive long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs). In order to understand the molecular basis of these effects, gene expression profiling was performed for each fusion gene by oligonucleotide microarray analysis at 3 different time points (6 h, 3 days, and 8 days post transduction). At the 6 h time point both AML1-ETO and PML-RAR\u03b1 caused extensive changes in gene expression with a predominance of downregulated genes. The number of genes dysregulated by AML1-ETO and PML-RAR\u03b1 decreased dramatically at the 3-day time point. These data are consistent with the fact that these two oncoproteins are DNA-binding transcription factors that are known to repress transcription. In contrast, MLL-AF9 and NUP98-HOXA9 altered the expression of fewer genes at the 6 h time point with a preponderance of upregulated genes; at the 3 day time point, the number of genes dysregulated by NUP98-HOXA9 and MLL-AF9 increased. These findings suggest that NUP98-HOXA9 and MLL-AF9 may have delayed effects that are not due to direct transcriptional regulation. Homeobox transcription factors were upregulated by both MLL-AF9 and NUP98-HOXA9, but not by either AML1-ETO or PML-RAR\u03b1. The results of the biological assays and gene profiling show marked similarities between NUP98-HOXA9 and MLL-AF9, and suggest that they transform cells by similar pathways that are different from those used by AML1-ETO and PML-RAR\u03b1."
