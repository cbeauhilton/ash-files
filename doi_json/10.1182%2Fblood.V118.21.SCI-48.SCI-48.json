    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-48 Over the last decade, five clinical studies on gene therapy for hemophilia A and B using viral and nonviral vectors for liver-restricted or ectopic expression of clotting factor demonstrated safety with no inhibitor formation. Although efficacy in these early phase trials was not achieved because of sustained levels of clotting factor below 1%, these studies form the basis for the second generation of clinical trials. To date, two studies on adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector encoding a FIX transgene for liver-restricted expression are ongoing. In one study using a modified AAV genome pseudotyped with serotype 8, emerging data are encouraging and sustained therapeutic levels of FIX have been obtained in a dose-dependent manner. Novel approaches for hemophilia have been explored targeting hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) using lentiviral vectors for expressing FVIII or FIX genes. Transgene expression under the control of either a non-lineage specific promoter or a platelet-specific promoter showed biological activity and improvement of the disease phenotype. The platelet-restricted approaches did not increase circulating plasma clotting factor levels, but they resulted in enrichment of the factor at the injury site upon platelet activation. An advantage of targeting FVIII expression and storage in platelets is the protection of FVIII from neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors). In this model, platelet-FVIII provided superior hemostasis than elevated plasma FVIII levels upon hemostatic challenges in the microcirculation and macrocirculation. Recently, platelet-restricted expression of human FVIII gene using a lentiviral vector for ex vivo transduction of canine HSC resulted in improvement of the disease phenotype in severe hemophilia A dogs without unwanted immune responses to the transgene. Additional strategies to optimize gene- and/or cell-based approaches have also focused on use of clotting factors with enhanced biological activities will be discussed. Together with the generation of novel vectors, further enhancement of both the efficacy the safety of these approaches is envisioned. Disclosures: Arruda: Pfizer: Research Funding.",
