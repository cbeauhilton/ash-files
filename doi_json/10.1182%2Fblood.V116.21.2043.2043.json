    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2043 Introduction: Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) describes anemia associated with diverse chronic inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic processes. These conditions are frequently associated with increased circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6). IL-6 regulates expression of the hormone hepcidin, which inhibits the release of iron from hepatocytes, macrophages, and enterocytes into the circulation. In addition to IL-6, hepcidin gene expression is known to be transcriptionally regulated by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that BMP signaling is required for the induction of hepcidin gene expression by IL-6 and plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of ACD. Methods: We used a turpentine-dependent model of ACD in mice. Mice were challenged with weekly subcutaneous injections of turpentine, which induces anemia in an IL-6 dependent manner. This model was studied to determine hepcidin gene expression and rescue ACD using BMP inhibition. Moreover, we examined hepcidin gene expression in zebrafish injected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and in transgenic zebrafish overexpressing human IL-6. The regulation of hepcidin gene expression was also studied in the human hepatocarcinoma cell line (HepG2). Results: Injections of mice with IL-6 (0.8 \u03bcg/g ip) increased hepatic hepcidin mRNA levels expression at 24 hours and decreased serum iron concentrations. Both effects were prevented by a small molecule BMP type I receptor kinase inhibitor, LDN-193189, or protein BMP antagonists. Weekly turpentine injections induced microcytic anemia after 3 weeks with a decrease in hemoglobin levels from 12.8\u00b10.3 to 9.7\u00b11.7 g/dL (*p<0.01). Concurrent treatment with LDN-193189 prevented turpentine-induced anemia and microcytosis (*p<0.01 for both). In mice challenged with turpentine for 6 weeks, treatment with LDN-193189, beginning after anemia was established at week 3, led to an increase in hemoglobin levels at week 6 (10.9\u00b10.1 vs 9.5\u00b10.2 g/dL, LDN193189 vs vehicle, respectively; *p<0.05). In zebrafish, microinjection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or overexpression of human IL-6 induced hepatic hepcidin expression, an effect which was blocked by LDN-193189. Incubation of HepG2 cells with IL-6 (100 ng/ml) increased hepcidin mRNA levels 2 to 5 fold. Pretreatment with LDN-193189, or recombinant protein BMP antagonists such as noggin, abrogated the induction of hepcidin expression by IL-6. Incubation of HepG2 cells with BMP6 (2.5 to 10 ng/ml) modestly increased hepcidin mRNA levels. However, the combination of IL-6 and BMP6 synergistically increased hepcidin gene expression (*p<0.05). Conclusion: BMP signaling appears to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of anemia in a mouse ACD model. Our findings support the concept that BMP signaling is required for the induction of hepcidin gene expression by IL-6 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, manipulation of BMP signaling represents a potentially novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of anemia associated with inflammation.
