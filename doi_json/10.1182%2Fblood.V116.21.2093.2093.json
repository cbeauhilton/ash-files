    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2093 Background: Adoptive immunotherapy is a promising novel approach to the treatment of cancer. However, clinical translation of adoptively transferred CD4 T cells is limited by cotransfer of an inhibitory population of regulatory CD4 T cells (T regs ). We identified a method of isolating viable antitumor CD4 T cells while excluding T regs based on two surface markers\u2014CD44 and CD137. Methods: We have developed a model for adoptive cell therapy of lymphoma whereby anti-tumor T cells are generated in vivo through vaccination with a CpG-loaded whole cell vaccine (CpG/H11). These vaccine-induced cells can protect from lethal tumor challenge when isolated and transferred into lethally irradiated, syngeneic recipient mice. We investigated the subsets of T cells involved in the anti-tumor response through a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays. Results: Adoptive transfer of CD137 neg CD44 hi CD4 T cells, but not other sub-populations, provided protection from B cell lymphoma. We demonstrate that the population of CD137 pos CD44 hi CD4 T cells consists primarily of activated T regs . In vitro, these CD137 pos cells suppressed the proliferation of effector cells in a contact-dependent manner. We observed that this CD137 pos T reg population persisted following adoptive transfer and maintained expression of FoxP3 as well as CD137. Moreover , the addition of CD137 pos CD44 hi CD4 cells to CD137 neg CD44 hi CD4 cells suppressed the antitumor immune response. In the presence of CD137 pos CD44 hi CD4 T cells, homing of other T cell populations to tumor sites was disrupted. These results suggest that CD137 expression on CD4 T cells defines a population of activated T regs that prevent antitumor immune responses. Conclusions: Our findings identify two surface markers that can be used to facilitate the enrichment of anti-tumor CD4 T cells while depleting an inhibitory T reg population. This approach has direct applicability to clinical trials for patients with lymphoma. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
