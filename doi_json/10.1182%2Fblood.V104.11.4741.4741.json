    "abstract_text": "In patients (pts) with mast cell (MC) proliferative disorders, the clinical course, prognosis, and outcome vary depending on age, organ-involvement, and the disease-variant. We have retrospectively analyzed the clinical course and outcome in 56 pts with MC disorders refered to the University of Vienna between 1987 and 2004. Using WHO criteria, pts were found to have cutaneous mastocytosis (CM, n=6), indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM, n=35), aggressive SM (ASM, n=3), mast cell leukaemia (MCL, n=1), SM with associated clonal hematologic non-MC-lineage disease (SM-AHNMD, n=6), and myelomastocytic leukemia (MML, n=5). These groups differed from each other in serum tryptase levels, hemoglobin, platelet counts, and lactate dehydrogenase (p5%) of MC in bone marrow smears, and iii. splenomegaly. Polychemotherapy resulted in complete remission in MML, but not in ASM or MCL. Interferon-alpha and 2CdA showed cytoreductive effects in some pts with ASM, but did not work in MCL. For the latter group of pts new therapies need to be developed.",
