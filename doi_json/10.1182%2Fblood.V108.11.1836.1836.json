    "abstract_text": "BCR/ABL is associated with an unfavorable prognosis in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We used DNA microarrays to identify gene expression profiles and molecular interaction networks related to BCR/ABL status and clinical outcome in a set of 54 adult ALL specimens from the MRC UKALL XII/ECOG E2993 intergroup study (21 p185 BCR/ABL - and 16 p210 BCR/ABL -positive and 17 BCR/ABL negative). In order to avoid biases associated with commonly used sample amplification procedures, we have implemented an indirect two-step labeling protocol based on signal amplification by use of dendrimer technology. Using a two-class, non-parametric t-test and a false discovery rate cutoff of 5%, we identified 271 genes (including GAB1 , CIITA , XBP1 , CD83 , SERPINB9 , PTP4A3 , NOV , LOX , CTNND1 , BAALC and RAB21 ) as differentially expressed in BCR/ABL positive ALL compared with BCR/ABL negative ALL. They separate these two classes of adult ALL with an overall accuracy of 93% and are enriched for three highly relevant biological functions: Cellular Growth and Proliferation (57 genes, p = 0.004\u20130.044), Cell Death (49 genes, p = 0.0007\u20130.049), and Hematological System Development and Function (40 genes, p = 0.00004\u20130.049). Network analysis demonstrated complex interaction patterns of these genes, and identified FYN and IL15 as the hubs of the top-scoring network. We confirmed these findings by both qRT-PCR analysis of the initial set of samples and by cross-platform validation in an independent cohort of 128 adult ALL specimens. In addition, within the BCR/ABL positive subgroup, we identified 14 clones found to be over-expressed ( TSPAN16 , ADAMTSL4 ) or under-expressed ( PILRB, STS-1, SPRY1 ) in p185 BCR-ABL - relative to p210 BCR-ABL -ALL. In a nearest-centroid classification, these clones correctly predict the BCR/ABL subtype with a cross-validated prediction accuracy of 95%. No differential gene expression was detected among Rho family GTPases and their known interaction partners. Finally, we constructed a gene expression- and interaction-based outcome predictor consisting of 27 genes (including GRB2 , GAB1 , GLI1 , IRS1 , RUNX2 and SPP1 ), which strongly correlated with overall survival in BCR/ABL positive adult ALL (p=0.0001), independently of other clinical parameters such as age (p=0.25) and white blood cell count at presentation (p = 0.003). These findings may be useful for developing novel therapeutic targets and prognostic markers in adult ALL."
