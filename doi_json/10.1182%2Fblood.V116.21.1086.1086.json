    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1086 Biosimilar enoxaparin preparations are in use outside the U.S. Due to compositional variations, their interaction with platelet factor 4 (PF4) differs leading to differential immunogenic responses between branded and biosimilar agents. To compare their immunogenic response, branded enoxaparin (Clexane\u00ae, Sanofi-Aventis) and a biosimilar version (Cutenox\u00ae, Gland-Pharma) were administered to healthy volunteers (n=110/drug) at a dose of 40 mg SQ for10 days. Blood samples drawn on days 1 and 10 were analyzed for anti-heparin/PF4 antibody (A-HPF4-Ab) titers and subtypes by ELISA (GTI, Brookfield, WI). Treatment with each LMWH resulted in comparable A-HPF4-Ab generation as compared by using the total absorbance for each population (p<0.05). However in the thrombin generation assays clexane group showed a stronger inhibition (45+12% vs 32+9%). None of these antibodies activated platelets as determined by the serotonin release assay. The two groups alos showed comparable AXa and AIIa responses (p<0.05). Antibody subtyping demonstrated different profiles between LMWHs. For IgG (Clexane1=0.15\u00b10.04, Clexane10=0.21\u00b10.06, Cutenox1=0.17\u00b10.04, Cutenox10=0.28\u00b10.10) with a significant time effect (p<0.0001), a significant drug effect (p<0.0001), and a significant time by drug interaction (p=.0009). Post hoc comparisons showed a difference between the drugs at time 0 (p=0.03), a difference between the drugs at time 10 (p<0.0001) and a significant time effect for each drug (p<0.0001). For IgA (Clexane1=0.12\u00b10.02, Clexane10=0.15\u00b10.02, Cutenox1=0.12\u00b10.03, Cutenox10=0.13\u00b10.02) with significant effects for time (p<0.0001), drug (p=0.0078) and for the drug \u00d7 time interaction (p<0.0001). The post hoc comparisons showed a significant drug effect at time 10 (p<0.0001). There was a significant time effect for Clexane (P<0.0001) but not for Cutenox. For IgM (Clexane1=0.11\u00b10.01, Clexane10=0.13\u00b10.02, Cutenox1=0.11\u00b10.03, Cutenox10=0.13\u00b10.02), there was only a time effect (p<0.0001). The post hoc comparisons showed no difference between drugs at either time, but significant time effects for each drug (p<0.0001). The immunogenic potential of LMWHs varies in terms of ability to generate A-HPF4-Ab, the antibody subtypes generated, and their cross-reactivity with pre-formed A-HPF4-Ab. Such parameters may be useful in defining the bioequivalence of generic LMWHs. Future studies evaluating the immunogenicity of different compounds in patients exposed to biosimilar drugs are warranted. Disclosures: Jeske: PolyMedix, Inc.: Research Funding."
