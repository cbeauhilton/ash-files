    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3593 Unlike other hematologic disorders, chronic lymphocytic leukemia(CLL) exhibits remarkable heterogeneity in the rates of disease progression among cases. CLL cells survive by receiving signals from the microenvironment via various receptors: B-cell antigen receptor (BCR), Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytokine and chemokine receptors. We previously reported that CLL clones with somatically mutated IGHV s and high (\u226530%) percentage of CD38 expressing cells have the highest percentage of CCR4-expressing cells. To further explore the functional contribution of the CCR4:CCL17 axis in CLL, we studied CCL17-induced chemotactic behavior in 16 CLL cases. In transwell cultures we observed a bimodal migratory response to CCL17 at 2 doses in a dose range of 0.78\u2013 25ng/ml, in ~60% of cases; the remaining cases showed maximal migration at a single dose (1.56 or 3.12ng/ml). A comparison of phenotypes of the migrated and non-migrated cell populations was undertaken in 10 cases, analyzing CXCR3, CXCR4, CCR4 and CCR7 that are involved in homing of cells to sites favoring growth, and CD31, CD38 and CD69, activation related molecules. The migrated cells consistently showed significantly higher percentages and densities of CD38 expression than the non-migrated cells suggesting a role for CD38 in the CCR4-mediated downstream pathway. CCR4 ligand, CCL17, is constitutively expressed in the thymus and is produced by dendritic cells, endothelial cells, keratinocytes and fibroblasts, whereas CCL22 is produced by tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. Serum levels of both these ligands in untreated patients were quantified by ELISA. CCL17 levels ranged between 45-1, 229 pg/ml in U-CLL cases (n=23) and between 43-1, 418 pg/ml in M-CLL cases (n=30). CCL22 levels ranged between 121-5, 497 pg/ml in U-CLL cases (n=23) and 409-5, 502 pg/ml in M-CLL cases (n=30). The percentages of CCR4- expressing B cells directly correlated with percentages of T cells expressing CCR4 in individual cases, whereas they inversely correlated with both, serum levels of CCL17 (p< 0.01) and CCL22 (p< 0.05). CCL17 produced by DCs in peripheral organs may exert an accessory role in BCR- and TLR-9-mediated immune responses in B cells. We therefore tested if CCL17 supported BCR- and TLR-mediated proliferative responses in a cohort of 31 (16 U-CLL and 15M-CLL) CLL cases. CCL17 augmented BCR-mediated B-cell proliferation in 9/16 (56%) U-CLL cases, but only in 3/15 (20%) M-CLL cases. On the other hand, CCL17 showed an additive effect in promoting TLR-9-mediated cell proliferation in 13/15 (87%) M-CLL cases at a dose of 2ng/nl (approximating that detected in serum); it also augmented TLR-9 mediated B cell proliferation in 6/16 U-CLL cases but at a 5-fold or higher dose (10-25 ng/ml). In a subset of this cohort (8 cases) CCL17-induced modulation of molecules involved in the apoptotic process was studied. We found upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl2 and down-regulation of pro-apoptotic molecules Bim, PUMA, and Bid in 5 of these cases. The pro-survival effects of CCL17 were partially abrogated by the blocking anti-CCR4 mAb (1G1). Taken together, these findings suggest that CCL17 plays a role in modulating TLR-9-mediated signaling and migration in CLL. Therefore, inhibition of CCR4:CCL17 interaction in vivo represents a novel therapy by preventing migration of CLL cells towards an environment that promotes their survival.
