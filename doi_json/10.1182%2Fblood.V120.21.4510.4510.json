Methods Four patients (median age, 11 years; range, 8\u201315 years) with severe aplastic anemia and all of them had HLA-haploidentical donors more than or equal to 2/8 HLA (HLA-A, B, C and DRB1) mismatched at antigen level. The conditioning regimen consisted of pretransplantation DLI (Lymphocytes, 1\u00d710e7/kg at day -9); 40mg/m2/day of fludarabine (day-6 to -2); 3.2mg/kg/day of Busulfex (day-6 and -5); 10mg/kg/day of Thiotepa (day -4) and 50mg/kg/day of Cy on day -7, 14.5mg/kg on day-3,-2 and 40mg/kg on day +3,+4, respectively. The prophylaxis of acute GVHD consisted of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. The median follow-up time is 5 (rang: 3\u20136) months. Results The median times to neutrophil (>500/I\u0300L) and platelet recovery (>20,000/I\u0300L) were 21 and 23.5 days, respectively. No acute GVHD and Chronic GVHD were, so far, observed for all patients and were survive without SAA. Conclusion Posttransplantation cyclophosphamide for the prophylaxis of acute GVHD was safe and effective. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
