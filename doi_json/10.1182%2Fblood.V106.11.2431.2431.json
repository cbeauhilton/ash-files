    "abstract_text": "Purpose: To evaluate efficacy, safety, Disease-Free Survival (DFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in patients with indolent non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) treated with chemotherapy vs. immunotherapy vs immunochemotherapy as first-line therapy, an up-date report. Methods: Patients with indolent NHL were randomized to receive: (A) Rituximab x 6/w, (B) CNOP (cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, vincristine and prednisone) x 6 or (C) R-CNOP x 6, at standard doses. Results: 195 patients were included, 183 are evaluable for OS and toxicity (A:62, B:55 and C:66), 144 are evaluable for overall response rate (ORR) and DFS (A:53, B:41 and C:50). Clinical characteristics: 89 male (45.6%), mean age 59\u00b114 (\u00b1SD), 148 (75.9%) in stage (III/IV), without significant differences between groups. Overall Response Rate (CR+PR) was: A: 84.9%, B:83.4% and C:90% ( P =0.545). Neutropenia grade 3/4 was more frequent in the chemotherapy groups: A: 4.8%, B: 23.6% and C:18.2% ( P =0.001) as it was the infectious toxicity (grade 2/4): A:4.8%, B:5.5% and C:15.2% ( P =0.07). DFS at 24 months was: A 68%, B:65% and C:70%, ( P =0.93) and the OS was A:87%, B:84% and C:78%. P =0.89. Conclusions: We did not find any important differences, between groups, regarding the Overall Response Rate, Disease Free Survival and Overall Survival at 24 months. However, single agent rituximab was better tolerated, with less toxicity in comparison with the chemotherapy containing groups. Based on these findings, it maybe reasonable to use immunotherapy only, as first-line therapy for patients with indolent NHL."
