    "abstract_text": "Array based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) has revolutionized the study of chromosomal imbalances but generally is incapable of detecting balanced genomic rearrangements like reciprocal translocations, which play central roles in the pathogenesis and diagnosis of lymphomas, leukemias and other tumors. The precise identification of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) translocation partners, for example, is essential for the classification of B cell lymphomas and for predicting prognosis in plasma cell neoplasms like multiple myeloma. Using IgH translocations as a model for balanced genomic rearrangements, we have developed a simple modification of array CGH that we call translocation-CGH (transCGH) and that enables the rapid identification of IgH translocation partners and precise mapping of translocation-associated breakpoints to unprecedented resolution. To render IgH translocations detectable on CGH arrays, genomic DNA from test and reference samples is modified prior to array hybridization in an enzymatic linear amplification reaction that employs a single IgH joining (J H ) or switch (S\u03bc/S\u03b1/S\u03b5) region primer, resulting in specific amplification of any fusion partner sequences that may be inserted (via translocation or other rearrangement) downstream of the IgH primer. Using a single tiling-density oligonucleotide array representing such common IgH partner loci as MYC, BCL2 and CCND1 (cyclin D1), transCGH successfully identified and mapped to \u223c100bp resolution an assortment of known IgH fusion breakpoints in various cell lines and primary lymphomas, including J H -CCND1 breakpoints in MO2058 and Granta 519 cell lines (mantle cell lymphoma), a cytogenetically cryptic S\u03b1-CCND1 fusion in U266 (myeloma), J H -MYC and S\u03bc-MYC breakpoints in MC116 and Raji (Burkitt lymphoma), and J H -BCL2 breakpoints in DHL16 (large cell lymphoma; minor cluster region) and in an archival case of follicular lymphoma (major breakpoint region). We then used transCGH to analyze 4 archival cases of mantle cell lymphoma and one t(11;14)-positive case of B cell prolymphocytic leukemia, all of which lacked PCR-detectable translocation breakpoints at the CCND1 major translocation cluster (MTC). Five novel CCND1 translocation breakpoints were identified and mapped to \u223c100bp resolution, allowing the rapid design of patient-specific PCR primers for amplification, sequencing, and confirmation of the predicted breakpoints. One breakpoint mapped to within 500bp of the MTC, whereas the other 4 were scattered across a \u223c150kb region flanking the MTC. To our knowledge, this represents the largest series of non-MTC mantle cell lymphoma breakpoint sequences reported to date. It also illustrates how transCGH can facilitate the rapid cloning of previously unidentified IgH translocation breakpoints dispersed over very large genomic regions. Because transCGH requires only genomic DNA and can simultaneously detect both balanced IgH translocations and genomic imbalances at ultra-high resolution on the same array, it may become a useful alternative to molecular cytogenetic methods (e.g. FISH) for clinical testing of B cell and plasma cell neoplasms. transCGH also will facilitate the development of highly sensitive breakpoint-specific PCR assays for detecting minimal residual disease. Finally, because the primer used in the linear amplification reaction is fully customizable, transCGH can readily be adapted to identify and map other balanced translocations (or more complex genomic fusions) that involve non-IgH loci, provided that one of the fusion partners is known."
