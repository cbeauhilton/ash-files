    "abstract_text": "Background: Young (age < 60 years) patients with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM) are potential candidates for curative therapy with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In such transplant-eligible patients, median overall survival (OS) is reported to be between 78 and 128 months. Because clinical course in an individual patients is markedly heterogeneous (survival ranges of months to decades), objective prognostic variables are essential for transplant decision making. Accordingly, we recently developed a modified Dupriez prognostic scoring system (PSS) that effectively discriminated between high (2 or more risk factors), intermediate (one risk factor) and low (no risk factor) risk patient groups based on the presence or absence of complete blood count (CBC)-derived adverse parameters; hemoglobin < 10 g/dl, leukocyte count < 4 or > 30 \u00d7 10 9 /L, and platelet count < 100 \u00d7 10 9 /L ( Dingli et al. Cancer 2006 ; 106 : 623 ). In the current study, we identify absolute monocytosis of \u2265 1 \u00d7 10 9 /L as an additional independent risk factor for survival in AMM. Methods: A consecutive cohort of WHO-defined AMM patients diagnosed before the age of 60 years was identified. The impact of various clinical and laboratory parameters on overall survival was evaluated with univariate and multivariable analysis. Results: The study included 129 patients (median age 52 years, range 18\u201360; 69 males) with AMM. An overall median survival of 75 months was univariately affected by platelet count < 100 \u00d7 10 9 /L, hemoglobin level of < 10 g/dL, leukocyte count of either < 4 or > 30 \u00d7 10 9 /L, monocytosis of \u2265 1 \u00d7 10 9 /L, and, where cytogenetic studies were available (n=41), presence of unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities (p < 0.01 in each instance). On multivariable analysis, all but leukocyte count maintained their significance. The independent prognostic value of monocyte count was also validated against the modified Dupriez score (see above) and thus allowed further refinement of the particular CBC-based PSS that included monocytosis of \u2265 1 \u00d7 10 9 /L as a fourth risk factor; low-risk identified patients with none of the 4 risk factors, intermediate-risk with one risk factor, and high-risk with 2 or more risk factors (Figure 1). For comparison, Figure 2 illustrates survival curves according to the original Dupriez PSS. Conclusion: Monocytosis of \u2265 1 \u00d7 10 9 /L is an independent risk factor for inferior survival in AMM. Figure 1. View large Download slide Mayo score Figure 1.
