    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4629 Background: Patients with refractory CLL have poor outcome despite currently used salvage treatment. Regimens based on high-dose corticosteroids seem to offer a promising treatment option in this scenario. High-dose methylprenisolone combined with rituximab (R-HDMP) demonstrated significant activity in relapsed/refractory CLL but serious infectious complications occurred in a substantial proportion of patients. Pilot data have shown that combination of dexamethasone and rituximab (R-Dex) may provide comparable results with less toxicity. Aims and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the efficacy and safety of R-Dex in patients (pts) with CLL treated at two tertiary centers between April 2006 and February 2010. Patients received two versions of R-Dex regimen: the dose of rituximab was either 500 mg/m 2 on day 1, 8, 15, 22 (375 mg/m 2 in 1st cycle), repeated every 4 weeks (n=25) or 500 mg/m 2 on day 1 (375 mg/m 2 in 1st cycle) repeated every 3 weeks (n=16). The dose of dexamethasone was identical in both regimens: 320 mg per cycle (40 mg on day 1\u20134 and 10\u201313 or 15\u201318). Results: R-Dex was administered to 41 patients (19 males) with median age of 68 years (range, 44\u201381) indicated for treatment according to NCI-WG criteria. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia was the only indication for the treatment in 7 patients. Rai stage III/IV was present in 37/41 pts. IgVH genes were unmutated in 24/29 pts with available results. Cytogenetic aberrations detected by FISH (n=33) revealed del 17p in 7 patients; del 11q in 11 patients; del 13q in 15 patients and trisomy 12 in 5 patients. Median number of previous therapies was 2 (0-8); 29/41 pts were previously treated with fludarabine-based regimens. The effect of R-Dex in evaluable patients without hemolysis (n=32) was: overall response rate (ORR), n= 21 (62%), complete remission (CR), n=6 (18%), partial remission (PR), n=15 (44%), stable disease (SD), n=4 (12%) and progressive disease (PD), n=5 (15%). All patients treated with R-Dex for autoimmune cytopenia achieved complete resolution of hemolysis. Grade III or IV toxicity included infections in 13 patients (32%), steroid diabetes in 6 patients (15%) and rituximab infusion-related side effects in 3 patients (7%). At the time of analysis (February 2010), median progression free survival (PFS) was 9 months; median overall survival has not been reached. There was no difference in ORR, PFS or OS between the two versions of R-Dex regimen. Conclusions: This pilot study shows that R-Dex is a feasible and effective treatment for relapsed/refractory CLL. In particular, R-Dex appears to be highly effective in CLL with autoimmune cytopenias. However, infectious toxicity remains a serious issue. In addition, long-term disease control can be expected in minority of patients only. Interestingly, higher dose of rituximab per cycle did not result in improved efficacy.
