    "abstract_text": "Background: Aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) relapsing after standard first line chemotherapy represents an unmet clinical need. Currently, a phase 1/2 study with the combination of pixantrone, etoposide, bendamustine, and in CD20 positive tumors, rituximab, in patients with relapsed aggressive NHL of B- or T- cell phenotype (the PREBEN study) is ongoing. Here our aim was to molecularly characterize samples from the PREBEN trial and find clinical correlates for predicting treatment response. Methods: The profiling cohort consisted of 21 patients with pre-treatment RNA samples and clinical data. Nanostring PanCancer Pathways and PanCancer Immune profiling panels (altogether 1348 genes) were utilized for the gene expression analyses. The findings from gene expression analyses were correlated with clinical parameters. Results: Fourteen patients had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), whereas seven had peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). In general, the expression of DNA replication genes distinguished DLBCL from PTCL. Additionally, gene expression analyses identified genes having differential expression based on the response to the treatment. Supervised hierarchical clustering of the ten most differentially expressed genes could separate the responding (n=4) and non-responding (n=10) DLBCL patients into two distinct subgroups (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the responding (n=3) and non-responding (n=4) PTCL patients could be separated into distinct subgroups by supervised clustering with the ten most differentially expressed genes (Fig. 1B). Conclusion: Molecular profiles of aggressive NHL are heterogeneous and may be utilized for predicting the treatment response. More detailed molecular analyses are currently ongoing.
