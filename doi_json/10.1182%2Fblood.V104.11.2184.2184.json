    "abstract_text": "We recently reported that Tyk2 was essential for IFN-a-induced B lymphocyte growth inhibition, although Stat1 is not required for this IFN-a-mediated inhibition. This means that other signaling molecules besides Stat1, and which are activated by Tyk2, are thought to transduce the IFN-a signal inhibiting B lymphocyte growth. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with Tyk2, and identified Rack-1, originally described as a receptor for activated C kinase beta, associated with Tyk2. Receptor for activated C kinase (Rack)-1 is a protein kinase C interacting protein, and contains a WD repeat but has no enzymatic activity. In addition to protein kinase C, Rack-1 also binds to Src, phospholipase C gamma, and ras-GTPase-activating proteins. Thus, Rack-1 is thought to function as a scaffold protein that recruits specific signaling elements. In a cytokine signaling cascade, Rack-1 has been reported to interact with the IFN-alpha/beta receptor and Stat1. In addition, we show here that Rack-1 associates with a member of Jak, tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2). Rack-1 interacts weakly with the kinase domain and interacts strongly with the pseudo-kinase domain of Tyk2. Rack-1 associates with Tyk2 via two regions, one in the N-terminus and one in the middle portion (a.a.138\u2013203) of Rack-1. In addition, not only Tyk2 but other Jak kinases associate with Rack-1, and each Jak activation causes the phosphorylation of Tyrosine 194 on Rack-1. After phosphorylation, Rack-1 is translocated from cytoplasm or membrane toward the perinuclear region. In addition to functioning as a scaffolding protein, these results raise the possibility that Rack-1 functions as a signaling molecule in cytokine signaling cascades.",
