    "abstract_text": "We previously reported that histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity is elevated, but is not correlated to the JAK-2 mutation status, in patients with myelofibrosis myeloid metaplasia (MMM) (Blood 107:319b 2005). Now we have studied more patients: totally, 17 with MMM, 19 with other myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), and 16 normal volunteers as controls. Significantly elevated HDAC levels again was shown in patients with MMM compared with other MPD patients and normal volunteer controls (p<0.05). Sixteen patients with MMM were also studied for correlation between JAK-2 mutation status and HDAC levels; no significant correlation was found. We then studied which members of HDACs were elevated in patients with MMM. cDNA was prepared from total RNA obtained from blood CD 34 + cells; then QRT-PCR was performed using pre-made mixtures of primer and FAMTAMRA-labeled probes from ABI ( www.appliedbiosystems.com ). Primers and probe to GAPDH were used as internal controls. Cycle threshold (C t ) values were obtained graphically for target genes and internal control GAPDH gene products. Amplification efficiencies were calculated by plotting C t s from serial diluted cDNAs for target genes and GAPDH and all with slopes below 0.1. \u0394 C t values were obtained by subtracting GAPDH C t from target gene C t . Relative mRNA levels were determined by subtraction of normal control \u0394 C t values from MMM \u0394 C t values to give \u0394\u0394 C t values, which were converted to 2 \u2212 \u0394\u0394 C t (Relative Quantitation of Gene Expression). The results showed elevated HDAC1 (2.80), HDAC2 (18.45), HDAC3 (2.10), HDAC 6 (2.03) HDAC 9 (2.71), SIRT3 (70.20), and SIRT6 (39.40) and depressed HDAC4 (0.01), HDAC5 (0.001), HDAC8 (0.001), SIRT2 (0.23), SIRT5 (0.005), and SIRT7 (0.88). () indicates relative mRNA values of MMM to controls. These results suggest that HDAC activities are elevated in patients with MMM and are elevated in many members of HDAC. This study may lay the basis for using HDAC inhibitors in clinical trials treating patients with MMM.",
