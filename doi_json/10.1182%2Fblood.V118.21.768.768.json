    "abstract_text": "Abstract 768 Background: Lintuzumab, a humanized anti-CD33 antibody, targets myeloid leukemia cells and has modest activity against AML. To increase the antibody's potency yet avoid nonspecific cytotoxicity seen with \u03b2-emitting isotopes, the \u03b1-emitter bismuth-213 ( 213 Bi) was conjugated to lintuzumab. Substantial clinical activity was seen in phase I and II trials, but the use of 213 Bi is limited by its 46-min half-life. The isotope generator, 225 Ac (t \u00bd =10 days), yields 4 \u03b1-emitting isotopes and can be conjugated to a variety of antibodies using DOTA-SCN. 225 Ac-labeled immunoconjugates kill in vitro at radioactivity doses at least 1,000 times lower than 213 Bi analogs and prolong survival in mouse xenograft models of several cancers (McDevitt et al. Science 2001). Methods: We are conducting a first-in-man phase I dose escalation trial to determine the safety, pharmacology, and biological activity of 225 Ac-lintuzumab in AML. Results: Fifteen patients (median age, 62 yrs; range, 45\u201380 yrs) with relapsed (n=10) or refractory (n=5) AML were treated to date. Patients received a single infusion of 225 Ac-lintuzumab at doses of 0.5 (n=3), 1 (n=4), 2 (n=3), 3 (n=3), or 4 (n=2) \u03bcCi/kg (total administered activity, 23\u2013402 \u03bcCi). No acute toxicities were seen. Myelosuppression was the most common toxicity; the median time to resolution of grade 4 leukopenia was 26 days (range, 0\u201371 days). DLT was seen in 3 patients, including myelosuppression lasting >35 days in 1 patient receiving 4 \u03bcCi/kg and death due to sepsis in 2 patients treated at the 3 and 4 \u03bcCi/kg dose levels. Febrile neutropenia was seen in 4 patients, and 4 patients had grade 3/4 bacteremia. Extramedullary toxicities were limited to transient grade 2/3 liver function abnormalities in 4 patients. With a median follow-up of 2 mos (range, 1\u201324 mos), no evidence of radiation nephritis was seen. We analyzed plasma pharmacokinetics by gamma counting at energy windows for 2 daughters of 225 Ac, francium-221 ( 221 Fr) and 213 Bi. Two-phase elimination kinetics were seen with mean plasma t \u00bd -\u03b1 and t \u00bd -\u03b2 of 1.9 and 35 hours, respectively. These results are similar to other lintuzumab constructs labeled with long-lived radioisotopes. Peripheral blood blasts were eliminated in 9 of 14 evaluable patients (64%), but only at doses of \u22651 \u03bcCi/kg. Bone marrow blast reductions were seen in 8 of 12 evaluable patients (67%) at 4 weeks, including 6 patients (50%) who had a blast reduction of \u226550%. Three patients treated with 1, 3, and 4 \u03bcCi/kg achieved bone marrow blast reductions to \u22645%. Conclusions: This is the first study to show that therapy with a targeted \u03b1-particle generator is feasible in humans. 225 Ac-lintuzumab has antileukemic activity across all dose levels. Accrual to this trial continues to define the MTD. Disclosures: Jurcic: Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Membership on an entity's Board of Directors or advisory committees, Research Funding.
