    "abstract_text": "Most studies of VWF function have focused on VWF interactions with platelet GPIb, FVIII, and specific sites and types of collagen. Early studies carried out by Ruggeri and Montgomery demonstrated that in addition to binding GPIb on platelets, VWF also bound to the GPIIb-IIIa receptor (also known as integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23), but only in the absence of fibrinogen. Ruggeri and other groups have demonstrated that under flow, VWF interaction with GPIIb-IIIa is also critical to VWF-platelet biology. A large systematic study of VWF binding to GPIIb-IIIa (\u03b1IIb\u03b23) has not been undertaken previously in a cohort of type 1 and 2 VWD subjects. Studies were carried out on 619 VWD index cases (both type 1 and type 2 VWD) and 84 normal controls enrolled in the Zimmerman Program for the Molecular and Clinical Biology of VWD (ZPMCB-VWD) using a novel assay of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 binding of VWF. Zhu and coworkers expressed the soluble \u03b1IIb\u03b23 headpiece and previously characterized this in the open position when bound to ligand. This \u03b1IIb\u03b23 headpiece was used for our studies. An antigen capture ELISA was developed using the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 headpiece to capture VWF and to compare binding to the VWF:Ag as a ratio of VWF-\u03b1IIb\u03b23/VWF:Ag. ELISA plates were coated with the GPIIIa-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb), AP3 and used to capture the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 headpiece. Since fibrinogen blocks VWF binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23, plasma samples were heated at 56\u00b0C to precipitate fibrinogen, and then centrifuged to remove the precipitate. The resulting heat defibrinated plasma was utilized in the assay. Bound VWF was quantified using biotin-labeled AVW15, a MAb to VWF. The reference was the ISTH SSC Plasma Standard. As specific positive and negative controls, we used wild-type recombinant VWF containing the normal RGDS sequence at position 2507-2510, and mutant VWF containing the RGDE sequence at the same position. As an additional control, the monoclonal antibody 7E3, known to block aggregation by binding to \u03b23 was used to block \u03b1IIb\u03b23/VWF interactions. While binding of wt-VWF to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 was robust, no binding of the RGDE mutant was observed (<1% of wt). 7E3 completely inhibited binding of VWF to \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Interestingly, two other MAbs known to block the binding of Fg to \u03b1IIb\u03b23, AP2 and 10E5, did not inhibit VWF binding. The 84 normal controls had a mean VWF-\u03b1IIb\u03b23/VWF:Ag binding ratio of 0.87 with a 5% and 95% confidence limit of 0.53-1.39. 152 type 1 VWD (VWF <30IU/dL) samples had a modestly reduced binding ratio of 0.62 (0.36-0.85) with a significance of p<0.0001. The binding ratios of 55 type 2A and 41 2B VWD samples were markedly reduced with a ratio of 0.293 (0.12-0.67) and 0.40 (0.23-0.81) both with a significance of 0.0001. Since both of these latter VWF variants have abnormal VWF multimers, we tested recombinant D-pro VWF (no VWF propeptide present) and Y87S mutant VWF (absent VWF multimerization). No binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 was observed with VWF from either of these constructs. Among our ZPMCB-VWD index cases, we also had individuals with low VWF (VWF:Ag 30-50 IU/dL) that had an intermediate reduction between the normal controls and type 1 subjects. Type 2N VWD samples demonstrated no abnormal binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and type 2M subjects had minimal differences. While VWF binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 has been recognized previously, it has not been systematically studied in subjects with VWD. We identified a modest decrease in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 binding of VWF in type 1 VWD and in clinical subjects with low VWF. Furthermore, type 2A and 2B subjects have a much more profound reduction in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 binding and suggest an importance of normal multimeric VWF to the functional binding of VWF to \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Mutating the RGDS sequence in VWF, or adding 7E3 to block \u03b1IIb\u03b23, abrogate this VWF binding. To date we have not identified any of our enrolled ZPMCB-VWD subjects with mutation of the RGDS sequence or in the C4 domain of VWF, although mutations in this region recently have been reported by Legendre et al. at the ISTH2015 meeting. Such mutations are not identified with current VWF functional screening assays, but specific assays of \u03b1IIb\u03b23-VWF interaction, such as the one described here, can be used and suggest there are specific potential mutations and variants with abnormal multimers that have abnormal \u03b1IIb\u03b23 binding. The qualitative and quantitative assessment of VWF function continues to be complicated. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
