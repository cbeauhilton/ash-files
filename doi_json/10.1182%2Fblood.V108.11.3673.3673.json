    "abstract_text": "Purpose/Objective: To evaluate patterns of recurrence in patients with Hodgkin\u2019s (HL) and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) who subsequently undergo autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). In this population that has declared itself as high risk, we evaluated time to and sites of relapse relative to initial sites of disease and radiation therapy (RT). This information might enhance understanding of the natural history of these diseases in the setting of modern therapy, influence treatment strategies, and assist in screening decisions. Materials/Method: We analyzed the records of all 281 consecutive patients with refractory or recurrent HL and NHL (indolent and aggressive, as defined at initial diagnosis) who underwent ASCT in our center between 5/92\u20137/03. Patients were initially diagnosed between 1979\u20132003 at a median age of 44 years (8\u201370). 25 patients were unevaluable due to insufficient data, and 68 patients were excluded from analysis because their disease was refractory to initial and salvage therapy. HL patients were segregated according to initial staging (I/II vs. III/IV). Results: Early stage HL patients relapsed at a median of 2.0 years (0.5\u201310.3) with 87% relapsing in initial disease site(s); 13% (95% CI 3.8\u201330.1%) relapsed only in new sites. Advanced stage HL patients relapsed at a median of 1.4 years (0.6\u201310.5) with 96% relapsing in initial site(s); 4% (95% CI 0.1\u201321.9%) relapsed only in new sites. Indolent histology NHL patients relapsed at a median of 2.1 years (0.5\u201314.9) with 83% relapsing in initial site(s); 17% (95% CI 7.3\u201332.8%) relapsed only in new sites. Aggressive histology NHL patients relapsed at a median of 1.0 year (0.3\u20138.0) with 64% relapsing in initial site(s); 36% (95% CI 26.2\u201346.2%) relapsed only in new sites. For early stage HD patients, recurrences were predominantly local, and uniformly so in those unirradiated. For all other groups, fewer patients were irradiated than unirradiated and local recurrences predominated regardless of therapy. Conclusions: Almost all patients with HL who relapse and subsequently undergo ASCT initially recur in previous disease sites. Although patients with aggressive histology NHL are more likely to relapse in new sites than patients with indolent NHL, local recurrences predominate in both groups. The median time to recurrence is brief (1\u20132.1 years). In a population defined by recurrent disease, it is expected that relapses will occur in irradiated sites. Relative protection by RT of local recurrence cannot be determined until all patients, regardless of relapse status, are analyzed. However, these data support an emphasis on local control and suggest that the frequency of screening be most rapid in the early post-therapy years.
