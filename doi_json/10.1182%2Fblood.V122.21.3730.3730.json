    "abstract_text": "A new class of non-coding RNA, known as long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs), has only recently been described. These lincRNAs have been found to play a role in various molecular processes within the cell including gene regulation, acting as sinks for microRNAs, and regulating splicing, implicating them in development and oncogenic processes. B lymphoblastic leukemia (B acute lymphoblastic leukemia; B-ALL), a malignancy of precursor B-cells, harbors mutations and translocations that result in a dysregulated gene expression. Interestingly, dysregulated expression of lincRNAs has been found in various cancers, but has not yet been described in B-ALL. Recently, we completed a gene expression profiling study in human B-ALL samples, which showed differential lincRNA expression in samples with particular cytogenetic abnormalities. This led us to hypothesize that lincRNAs may be related to disease pathogenesis. Here, we describe a promising lincRNA from our microarray data designated B-ALL associated long intergenic RNA 6 (BALIR-6). Expression of BALIR-6 is highest in patient samples carrying the MLL rearrangement (n=16; when compared to patients with TEL-AML1-translocated, n=39; E2A-PBX1-translocated, n=8; BCR-ABL-translocated, n=3; and cytogenetically normal cases, n=56; 1-way ANOVA p<0.0001) and showed significant variance in the expression level based on the immunophenotype (1-way ANOVA p=0.0004). BALIR-6 is located on chromosome 3p24.3 in humans, and exists in a syntenic gene block in with neighboring genes SATB1 and TBC1D5, and is conserved in mammals. Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) uncovered multiple transcript isoforms; from these, three were cloned out and sequenced, corresponding to the genomic locus as predicted. In B-ALL cell lines, BALIR-6 expression was highest in RS411 cells, which carry the MLL rearrangement, when compared to other B-ALL cell lines. This suggests that the cell lines may show a similar expression pattern to human B-ALL samples. To study the functional role of BALIR-6 we utilized siRNA in a mmu-miR-155 expression cassette to knockdown the transcript. In RS411 cells we observed a reduction in proliferation by MTS assay. Additionally, we observed an increase Sub-G0 cells and a decrease in G2-M phase cells by propidium iodide staining, suggesting an increase in apoptosis. Conversely, overexpression of BALIR-6 in a mouse pre-B cell line (70Z/3), leads to an increase in proliferation. Interestingly, during normal B cell development, BALIR-6 is dynamically expressed, with high expression in pre-B cells and subsequent downregulation, suggesting that a normal role during development is being hijacked in patients with B-ALL. Mechanistically, a few recent studies have described that lincRNAs can regulate gene expression in cis . To explore whether BALIR 6 regulates surrounding genes in cis , we analyzed microarray data of MLL rearranged B-ALL samples, finding that expression of BALIR-6 correlates with expression of surrounding genes SATB1 and TBC1D5 . Interestingly for SATB1, this correlation is also seen in human B cell developmental stages. Altering BALIR-6 expression by siRNA mediated knockdown or overexpression causes an effect on the expression of surrounding genes SATB1 and TBC1D5 . Previous findings have shown that dysregulated SATB1 has been seen in a variety of malignancies, suggesting a mechanism for how BALIR-6 may produce the changes in cell growth and apoptosis described above. Altogether, these results identify a novel and interesting RNA transcript with the potential to regulate gene expression and pathogenesis in B-ALL with MLL rearrangement, suggesting novel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications.
