    "abstract_text": "Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) for children with donors from family members. Patients and methods: Forty-two children under fourteen years old with hematologic malignancies underwent haploidentical HCT. The outcome was analyzed. Results: Four (9.5%) of the forty-two patients/donor pairs mismatched in one HLA locus, fifteen (35.7%) pairs in two loci and twenty three (54.8%) in three loci. They were followed up for a median of 612 (40\u20131779) days. All patients achieved stable engraftment. The cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade 2\u20134 was 57.2%, and that of grade 3\u20134 was 13.8%. The cumulative incidence of total and extensive chronic GVHD was 56.7% and 29.5%, respectively. The probability of leukemia-free survival was 65.1% in standard-risk group and 49.6% in high-risk group. Fourteen patients died, four from infection, six from relapse of leukemia, two from heart failure, one from severe acute GVHD, and one from lymphoproliferative disorders. The probability of relapse was 13.8% at 1 year and 27.9% at 2 year after transplantation. Conclusion: The results in this study encourage extending the haploidentical HCT without T-cell depletion to children with an indication for transplantation.",
