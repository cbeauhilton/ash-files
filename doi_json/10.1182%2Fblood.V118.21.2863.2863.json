    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2863 Introduction: The CLL8-trial is the first study that has shown not only an increase in complete remission rates and progression-free survival, but also an improved overall survival (OS) in physically fit, treatment-nau\u0301ve CLL-patients (pts) with FCR-chemoimmunotherapy in comparison to FC alone [Hallek et al., Lancet 2010]. Despite this remarkable progress, CLL remains an incurable disease and virtually all pts will eventually relapse. So far, little is known about the efficacy of 2nd-line therapies of these pts. Patients and Methods: Between July 2003 and March 2006 817 pts in good physical fitness as defined by a cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS) score of \u22646 and creatinine clearance 70 ml/min were randomized within the trial and received 6 courses FC (n=409; F: 25mg/m 2 i.v. d1\u20133 and C: 250 mg/m 2 i.v. d1\u20133; q 28 days) without or with rituximab (n=408; 375 mg/m 2 i.v. d0 cycle 1, 500 mg/m 2 d1 of all subsequent cycles; q 28 days) for 1st-line treatment. Results: As of March 2009, 65% of the patients who had received FCR were free of progression compared to 45% of those who were treated with FC (p24months (32 and 27 pts, 14% and 12%). Other prevalent 2nd-line therapies were single agent A (20 pts) or B (17 pts), CHOP and FC (11 pts respectively), chlorambucil (9 pts) as well as R monotherapy (7 pts). 9 pts underwent stem cell transplantations. Second-line therapies with FC+/\u2212R and B+/\u2212R were found to be more effective with regard to treatment-free survival (TFS, time to 2nd relapse) and OS when compared to A or CHOP-R and CHOP-like chemotherapies. However, the outcome of 2nd-line therapies seemed to be influenced by the 1st-line treatment. In pts initially treated with FC, FCR was found to be the most effective 2nd-line therapy (TFS: 23 months, OS: not reached), whereas in pts initially treated with FCR, a substitution of the chemotherapeutic agents FC by B seemed justified, as TFS was superior after 2nd-line treatment with B+/\u2212R (16 and 18 months respectively) when compared to FC+/\u2212R (11 and 8 months). Furthermore, in pts who had received FCR for 1st-line treatment, chemotherapy with FC or B was found to be at least equally or even more effective in prolonging OS than FCR or BR (OS calculated from beginning of 2nd-line therapy: FC: not reached, B: 45, FCR: 19, and BR 18 months). Conclusion: Second-line treatments of pts with a relapse after FC or FCR were found to be surprisingly heterogeneous even though the patient collective examined is comparatively homogenous due to the inclusion/exclusion criteria of a clinical trial. As the majority of CLL8-patients is still in remission and has not yet received a 2nd-line treatment, the therapies captured in this analysis are predominantly 2nd-line therapies for earlier relapses. Therefore and because of the short follow-up time, the results ought to be considered as preliminary and descriptive trends. The worse outcome of CHOP-like regimen and A-based therapies in comparison to more established CLL-therapies such as FC+/\u2212R and B+/\u2212R might be related to the fact, that these therapies were administered more often in case of an early relapse after FC/FCR, which is known to be related to other poor prognostic factors [Fink et al, ASH 2010]. Nevertheless, the observation of favorable TFS and OS times after 2nd-line treatment with FC+/\u2212R and B+/\u2212R supports the recommendation to repeat chemoimmunotherapy in case of a relapse >24 months after 1st-line treatment. Further analyses are needed to confirm the observation that chemotherapy (FC or B) without rituximab might be sufficient for for 2nd-line treatment after FCR.
