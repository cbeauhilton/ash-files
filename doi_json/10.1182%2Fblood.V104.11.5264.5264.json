    "abstract_text": "Background/Aims: Replicating episomal vectors present a potential alternative to currently used oncoretroviral vectors for gene transfer in hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells. Their main advantage is that they can persist in the recipient nucleus as independent units, without integrating into the host\u2019s genome, eliminating thus the risk of insertional mutagenesis. In the present study we explored the capacity of a recently developed SV40-based episomal vector, pEPI-eGFP, to stably transfect hematopoietic progenitor cell lines and primary cells, in order to evaluate its potential for therapeutic applications. pEPI-eGFP contains the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) cDNA and a Scaffold/Matrix Attachment Region (S/MAR) and it does not code for any proteins of viral origin. These unique properties qualify pEPI-eGFP as an attractive vehicle for gene therapy applications. Results: The vector was maintained as a stable episome in K562 cells for at least 100 generations and supported long-term EGFP expression, even in cells cultured in non-selective medium. Methylation-dependent cleavage assays demonstrated the vector\u2019s ability to self-replicate in K562 cells and MEL cells, whereas its episomal status was confirmed by Southern blotting and plasmid rescue in E. coli. The vector was also maintained in primary human fibroblasts for at least 30 passages with and without selection pressure. Transfection of CD34 + cells from umbilical cord blood with pEPI-eGFP was feasible by electroporation with an efficiency of up to 30%, as estimated by flow cytometric evaluation of eGFP expression 24\u201348 h post-transfection. Cytokine prestimulation of CD34 + cells did not enhance transfection efficiency, whereas transfection of post-mitotic cells, such as dendritic cells was also feasible. This suggests that efficient transfection with the vector does not require cell cycling. PCR with eGFP-specific primers in single CFU colonies derived from CD34 + /eGFP + /PI \u2212 FACS-sorted cells demonstrated the presence of the vector in ~20% of the colonies. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that pEPI-2 exhibits a considerable potential as a gene transfer vector for hematopoietic cells, as it confers long-term transgene expression in hematopoietic progenitor cell lines as a stable episome and can efficiently transfect unstimulated CD34 + cells. Further studies, both in vitro and in vivo , are required to assess the long-term maintenance in hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells and their progeny as well as other features of the vector, in order to evaluate its overall efficacy and possibly improve its performance.",
