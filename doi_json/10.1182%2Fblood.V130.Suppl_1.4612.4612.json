    "abstract_text": "Our previous studies have demonstrated that platelet-specific gene transfer under control of the \u03b1IIb promoter (2b) is effective in inducing immune tolerance not only to the coagulation factor VIII and IX, but also to the non-coagulant protein ovalbumin (OVA) in a model without pre-existing immunity (the non-primed model). In the present study, we explored whether platelet-specific gene transfer could induce immune tolerance in the primed model. To address this question, we first used C57BL6 wild type (WT) mouse models. Both donors and recipients were immunized with OVA to induce anti-OVA antibody development. OVA expression was introduced by 2bOVA lentivirus (LV) transduction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from WT/CD45.2 donors followed by transplantation into OVA-primed WT/CD45.1 recipients preconditioned with a sub-lethal 6.6Gy total body irradiation (TBI). 2bGFP was used as a control vector in parallel. Animals were analyzed after at least 4 weeks of bone marrow (BM) reconstitution. The viability of OVA genetically modified HSCs was confirmed by PCR in all 2bOVA-transduced recipients. After full bone marrow constitution, which takes about 12 weeks, the engraftment in the 2bOVA group (87.4\u00b14.4%, n=5) was similar to that in the 2bGFP group (87.8\u00b13.9%, n=5) as determined by flow cytometry. The OVA protein level was 6.7\u00b12.8 ng/10 8 platelets (n=5) in 2bOVA transduced recipients. Anti-OVA antibody titers declined with time in both groups. Six months after transplantation, recipients were rechallenged with OVA. All of the anti-OVA titers in 2bGFP-transduced recipients (n=5) increased dramatically, while only one in the 2bOVA group slightly increased. Normalized anti-OVA antibody titers in the 2bOVA group (90.8\u00b1152.7) were significantly lower than those in the 2bGFP group (1278\u00b12101) after OVA rechallenge, demonstrating that platelet-specific OVA gene delivery to HSCs can suppress anti-OVA immune responses in OVA-primed WT mice. To explore how immune suppression is established after platelet-specific gene transfer in the OVA-primed model, we transduced HSCs from OVA-specific TCR transgenic mice (OTII/CD45.2, in which greater than 97% CD4 T + cells are OVA-specific) with 2bOVALV and transplanted into OVA-primed WT/CD45.1 recipients preconditioned with 6.6Gy TBI. Untransduced transplanted mice were used as a control. After BM reconstitution, the OVA protein level was 32.3\u00b16.3 ng/10 8 platelets (n=5) in the 2bOVA-transduced group. Anti-OVA antibody titers in both groups declined with time. When all the recipients were rechallenged with OVA, 2 of 3 anti-OVA titers in the untransduced group increased, while none of the titers in the 2bOVA group increased. Normalized anti-OVA antibody titers in the 2bOVA group (4.1\u00b14.9) were significantly lower than those in the un-transduced group (152.3\u00b1214.5), demonstrating that platelet-specific OVA gene delivery to HSCs can also suppress the anti-OVA immune response in the OVA-primed WT mice that received 2bOVA-transduced HSCs from OTII mice (the OTII/WT model). After BM reconstitution, the engraftments in the 2 groups were similar (81.4\u00b12.6%, and 80.9\u00b12.5%, respectively), but donor-derived CD45.2 + CD4 + (OTII/CD4) T cells in the 2bOVA (0.2\u00b10.1%) group were consistently significantly lower than in the untransduced group (4.2\u00b11.1%) in peripheral blood during the entire study course. Also, donor-derived CD45.2 + CD4 + T cells in both spleen and lymph nodes were significantly lower in the 2bOVA group compared to the untransduced group. Interestingly, there were no differences in either percentage or total cell number of CD45.2 + CD4 + T cells in the thymus between the 2 groups, indicating that central tolerance may not play a role in the immune tolerance induced after platelet-targeted gene therapy. Meanwhile, the frequency and total number of endogenous CD4 + T cells were similar in the 2 groups. Of note, the percentages of donor-derived regulatory T (Treg) cells in the 2bOVA group were significantly higher than those in the untransduced group in peripheral blood, spleen, and lymph nodes, while there were no significant differences in the total numbers of donor-derived Treg cells between the 2 groups. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that platelet-specific gene therapy can induce immune tolerance in a primed system through two distinct pathways, peripheral antigen-specific CD4 + T cell clone deletion and regulatory T cell induction.
