    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2760 The significance of mutations in components of the DNA methylation machinery in blood cancer has become a topic of intense investigation. Unlike genetic modifications, the reversible nature of DNA methylation and other epigenetic changes makes them attractive therapeutic targets. Very recently, mutations in the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and the DNA demethylase TET2 were identified in human peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) [1]. These findings provided a novel link between the development and progression of PTCL with deregulation of DNA methylation processes. Importantly, this finding also extended the few known mutations associated with both T-cell lymphoma and myeloid leukemia. Our previous work identified acute sensitivity of MLL-AF9 \u2013induced myeloid leukemia (AML) to DNA demethylation through loss or haploinsufficiency of the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 [2]. Here, we investigated the sensitivity of PTCL to DNA demethylation. Lymphoma was induced in mice by inactivation of Snf5, a core subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, driven by CD4Cre (CD4Cre-Snf5 2lox ). Inactivation of Snf5 leads to rapid onset of mature CD8 + PTCL with a median survival of 10 weeks of age. Strikingly, loss of Dnmt1 in this model (CD4Cre-Snf5 2lox -Dnmt1 2lox ) completely abrogated development of lymphoma. Furthermore, haploinsufficiency of Dnmt1 was sufficient to increase event-free survival to 13 weeks of age (p = 0.0008). Loss or haploinsufficiency of Dnmt1 did not impact normal T cell development in the thymus with the exception of a modest reduction in CD8 + CD44 hi memory T cells. Based on the selective response of PTCL to reduced levels of Dnmt1 and DNA methylation, we screened a panel of pharmacological DNA demethylating agents for efficacy in PTCL. We found three putative DNA methylation inhibitors; the nucleoside inhibitor zebularine and non-nucleoside inhibitors RG108 and procainamide, which inhibited proliferation of primary murine PTCL in vitro. These inhibitors were effective at doses that did not restrict the proliferation of normal CD8 + T cells. When these inhibitors were evaluated for efficacy in vivo , both zebularine and procainamide were found to inhibit growth of primary murine PTCL. Together, these results suggest that therapy of PTCL with DNA methylation inhibitors or other DNA demethylating agents may achieve a favorable therapeutic index. Further, these results support the concept of a shared competitive advantage of myeloid leukemia and T-cell lymphoma in carrying mutations in the DNA methylation machinery.
