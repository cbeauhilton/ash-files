    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1591 MixL1, a paired-type homeodomain transcription factor, is implicated in pre-hematopoietic commitment of stem cell populations. In poorly-differentiated human lymphoma and leukemia lines, MixL1 is inappropriately over-expressed (Drakos et al., Human Pathol 2007:38:500). When constitutively expressed in mice, MixL1 is sufficient to induce Acute Myeloid Leukemia (Glaser et al., PNAS 2006:103:16460). On the basis of these observations, we hypothesize that MixL1 plays an important role in gating the cellular decision to remain in a poorly differentiated and proliferative phase rather than proceeding to definitive hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) identity. Several years ago, the placenta was shown to be a major site of hematopoiesis (Gekas et al., Dev Cell 2005:8:365; Ottersbach and Dzierzak, Dev Cell 2005:8:377). The placenta is composed of the chorionic disc and the allantois, the latter of which matures into the umbilical component of the placenta. The allantois exhibits definitive hematopoietic potential (Ziegler et al., Development 2006:133:4183; Corbel et al., Dev Biol 2007:301:478), and has recently been demonstrated to contain a core of stem cells referred to as the Allantoic Core Domain, or ACD, where potential placental hematopoietic activity may originate (Downs et al., Dev Dyn 2009:238:532). Our immediate goal is to evaluate whether MixL1 is expressed in the allantois, and to establish its precise spatiotemporal whereabouts with respect to early markers of hematopoietic cells, such as Runx1 (Chen et al., Nature 2009:457:887). Using immunohistochemistry in conjunction with the LacZ/Runx1 reporter mouse (North et al., Development 1999:126:2563), we have demonstrated that MixL1 is strongly expressed in the blood islands of the yolk sac, as well as in a broad, contiguous posterior domain of the embryo that extends to include the ACD stem cell core of the allantois. This domain does not include Runx1, and MixL1 expression temporally precedes that of Runx1 in the allantois. As development proceeds, the MixL1 signal becomes most prominent in putative nascent blood cells budding off from the poorly-described blood vessel common to the allantois, yolk sac and dorsal aortae, which we have called the \u201cVessel of Confluence\u201d (VOC). Here, fetal blood is shuttled into the umbilical cord to the chorion for exchange with the mother. Shortly thereafter, Runx1 begins to appear within VOC, and is co-expressed with MixL1. These findings provide preliminary evidence that MixL1 is expressed within the allantois, and within nascent blood cells derived from a specific arterial site common to the allantois, yolk sac, and fetus. Moreover, MixL1 expression appears to precede that of Runx1. Thus, MixL1 may identify one of the earliest hematopoietic precursor cell populations thus far known in mammals. Further, these data provide additional evidence that the allantois is a promising model system for the study of definitive hematopoiesis. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
