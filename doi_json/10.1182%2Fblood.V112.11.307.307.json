    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia expressing mutated NPM1 gene and cytoplasmic nucleophosmin (NPMc+ AML) [ Falini B et al, NEJM  2005 ; 352 : 254 \u2013266 ] is a new entity of WHO classification that shows distinctive biological and clinical features, including a unique molecular signature characterized by downregulation of CD34 and upregulation of most HOX genes [ Falini B et al, Blood  2007 ; 109 : 874 \u2013885 ]. Involvement of HOX genes in the maintenance of the stem-cell phenotype strongly suggest that AML with mutated NPM1 originates from a multipotent hematopoietic progenitor (HSC). This view is also supported by immunohistological findings showing that AML with mutated NPM1 frequently displays multilineage involvement [ Pasqualucci L et al, Blood  2006 ; 108 : 4146 \u20134155 ]. On the other hand, the frequent negativity of NPMc+ AML for the HSC-associated antigen CD34 raises the question of whether the mutation event occurs in a CD34-negative HSC (these cells have been identified in mice) or whether a minimal pool of CD34-positive NPM1 -mutated leukemic cells does exist. Currently, the hierarchical level of stem cell involvement in NPMc+ AML is unknown. To address this issue, we purified CD34+ cells from NPMc+ AML patients and detected NPM1 mutant protein in the sorted population by Western blot with anti-NPM mutant specific antibodies [Martelli MP et al, Leukemia 2008] (Figure 1A). We investigated 6 NPMc+ AML patients presenting at diagnosis with 0.12%, 0.14%, 0.38%, 5%, 22%, and 28% of CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood. In all cases, CD34+ fractions (purity >90%) harboured NPM1 mutant protein, indicating they belong to the leukemic clone (Figure 1B). The percentage of most undifferentiated CD34+/CD38\u2212 cells in the CD34+ fractions ranged from 5 to 97%. Notably, in at least one case, all CD34+ NPM1 -mutated leukemic cells were CD38\u2212negative. Moreover in all cases, CD34+ NPM1 -mutated leukemic cells appeared to express CD123 (IL-3 receptor), considered a marker of the leukemic stem cell and target of potential therapy. Double staining of bone marrow biopsies with anti-CD34 and anti-NPM antibodies revealed that the rare CD34+ cells expressed NPM1 aberrantly in the cytoplasm. Inoculation of CD34+ NPM1 -mutated AML cells into sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID mice resulted into leukemia engrafment in various body sites, especially bone marrow, spleen, lung and liver. Preliminary results showed that CD34+ leukemic cells reacquired the same leukemic phenotype as the original patient\u2019s, including CD34-negativity of the leukemic bulk in spite of any lack of differentiation. This finding suggests that NPM1 mutant protein may be involved in downregulation of CD34 antigen, while keeping a gene expression profile typical of the hematopoietic stem cell. These findings suggest the CD34+ fraction contains the SCID-leukemia initiating cells (SL-IC) and point to CD34+/CD38\u2212 HSC as the cell of origin of AML with mutated NPM1.
