    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4945 Background: bone marrow blast count is a crucial parameter to determinate the prognostic score according to IPSS in myelodysplastic syndromes. However even among the major experts the agreement about detection of a blast cells by optical microscopy is less than 90% (Mufti et al: Haematologica 2008). The aim of this study is to evaluate prognostic significance of immunocytometric count of medullar blasts compared to cytological count. Method: in a retrospective analysis of 104 patients with a minimum follow-up of three years, IPSS was calculated replacing cytological count of blasts with the flow cytometry one. Blasts were expressed as percentages of total cellularity, and identified by the combination of CD45/SSC with/without CD33, CD34 and CD117 antigens. The monoclonal antibodies used were CD34 FITC, CD117 PE, CD45 PerCp, CD33 APC. Acquisition of information on 1\u00d710 5 stained cells corresponding to the whole bone marrow cellularity was assessed on a dual-laser FACSCalibur flow cytometer using the CellQUEST software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose\u0301 CA USA). Survival of \u201clow + intermediate-1 risk\u201d (\u201cIPSS1+2\u201d) patients was compared to \u201cintermediate-2 + high risk\u201d ones (\u201cIPSS3+4\u201d) using Kaplan Meier method followed by logrank test. The comparison of ability among all blast count models to distinguish the probability of survival of the two groups (\u201cIPSS 1+2\u201d vs \u201cIPSS3+4\u201d) was based on \u03c7 2 value obtained by the logrank test. Results: considering IPSS obtained from any of the immunocytometric markers considered (CD33, CD34, CD117 and CD45dim/SSC), \u201cIPSS1+2\u201d group had always an extremely better survival than \u201cIPSS 3+4\u201d group with a level of statistical significance similar to survival study of \u201cstandard IPSS\u201d. Of all markers, CD45dim/SSC was the most capable to distinguish survival of \u201cIPSS1+2\u201d group versus \u201cIPSS3+4\u201d group (\u03c7 2 = 42. 5). Among others, CD117 and CD33 had a better discriminating power than cytological count (respectively \u03c7 2 = 38, 1 and \u03c7 2 = 22, 3 versus \u03c7 2 18, 2); only CD34 was worse than cytological count (\u03c7 2 =14, 2). Conclusion: the immunocytometric markers considered are demonstrated to be even better than cytological count as parameter in IPSS score. Their use has to be encouraged, especially where there is little experience in optical microscopy.
