    "abstract_text": "Abstract 579 Background: In AML, age and cytogenetics remain among the major prognostic factors. Age above 55 years and a complex karyotype (CK; \u2265 3 abnormal clones) or the presence of monosomy 7 (M7) are universally associated with unfavorable prognosis. Recent data from HOVON-SAKK ( J Clin Onc 26: 4791) suggest that in patients under the age of 60 years, subgroups with poor risk versus very poor risk can be delineated based on the presence of a MK. MK was defined as either the presence of at least two autosomal monosomies or one monosomy plus at least one structural abnormality. Limited data exists regarding the impact of MK in AML patients over the age of 55 years. Methods: Data from 935 AML patients above age 55 enrolled on three prospective ECOG therapeutic clinical trials (E1490, E3993, E3999) between 1990 and 2005 were retrospectively reviewed to identify those with MK with single and/or multiple monosomies, MK in the presence or absence of a CK, CK with/without MK, MK with/without M7, and normal karyotype (CN). CK was defined as \u2265 3 clonal abnormalities for the purposes of this study. Complete remission (CR), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Results: The median age of evaluable patients was 68 years (range 56 \u2013 93) with a male/female ratio of 391/299. Cytogenetic data were evaluable in 690 (74%) subjects. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities occurred in 399 (58%). Core-binding factor (CBF) abnormalities accounted for 16/399 (4%) whereas CK was detected in 181/399 (45%). MK was present in 172 (25%) evaluable cases, predominantly in the setting of CK (140/172, 81%). Overall CR was 44%. CR was achieved in 49% MK\u2212, 29% MK+, 31% CK+, and 49% of CK\u2212. Data for the combinations of MK and CK are presented in Table 1 . Median follow-up for survivors was 5.0 years. OS at 4-years was 9% for all evaluable patients and 4y-DFS was 12% in those achieving CR. Median OS of MK+/CK+ (0.3y) was significantly worse (p<0.001) than MK+/CK\u2212(0.6y), MK\u2212/CK+ (0.8y), and MK\u2212/CK\u2212(0.9y). Median DFS of MK+/CK+ (0.3y) was also significantly poorer (p<0.001) than MK+/CK\u2212 (0.9y), MK\u2212/CK+ (0.8y), and MK\u2212/CK\u2212 (0.9y). M7 was present in 82 (13%) enrolled patients with 98% (80/82) of M7 occurring within a MK. CR was achieved in 31% of MK+/M7+ and 27% of MK+/M7\u2212. Neither median OS nor DFS were significantly impacted by M7 status as noted in Table 2 . Conclusions: AML patients above the age of 55 years have an unfavorable prognosis with the majority of patients harboring adverse clonal cytogenetic abnormalities and failing to achieve a CR. Fewer than 10% survive 4-years from diagnosis. Results from the ECOG experience demonstrate the prognostic predictive value of MK in older AML patients. In contrast to the data presented by the HOVAN-SAKK group, the prognostic value of MK in patients over 55 years is limited to those with MK in combination with CK. These results also demonstrate the failure of monosomy 7 to provide prognostic value in the setting of MK. Table 1 Outcome data related to Monosomal and Complex Karyotypes  . MK\u2212/CK\u2212 .
