    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4845 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) represents 10\u201315% of all types of lymphoma. At present, more than 70% of patients can be cured with current strategies based on chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. However, one third of the cases finally relapses and needs salvage regimens usually consolidated with high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. The number of regimens and drugs available are limited and new protocols that increase the efficacy with manageable toxicity are needed. In the present communication we report the results of a retrospective study using the GemOx schema that combines the efficacy of gemcitabine in Hodgkin lymphoma with oxaliplatin, a less toxic and effective platinum-based drug. Patients and methods: Patients were eligible for this retrospective study, according to the following criteria: diagnosis of HL, which relapsed or failed to achieve complete remission after induction treatment. They received GemOx regimen that consisted of gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 and oxaliplatin 100mg/m 2 on day 1. Treatment was given every 15 days if feasible or every 21 days. To evaluate response and toxicity Cheson criteria and OMS toxicity scale were used respectively. Results: Between 2003 and 2012, 29 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma were retrospectively included in this study. All patients had recurrent (n=17) or refractory (n=12) disease. Median age was 24 (14\u201376) years and 50% had an International Prognosis Score (IPS) higher than 2. Patients received a mean of 2.79 previous regimens and 79% more than 1 regimen before GemOx with 48% relapsing after a prior autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Median follow-up was 41 months. 76% of patients responded (31% complete responses; CR). Responses were better in the relapsed setting or partial response (PR) (85% with a 45% of CR) compared to the truly refractory cases (55% PR) (p=0.037). Main prognostic factors for HL were assessed to view their impact on survival. Factors related with progression- free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were age lower than 45 years, response to GemOx and consolidation with stem cell transplantation (p=0.001). Presence of B-symptoms at diagnosis also influenced OS. Neurologic toxicity was present in 9% of patients, all of them grade I or II. Hematologic toxicity was also common, including grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in 23% of patients, and grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia in 33%. Nausea and vomiting occurred in all the patients at grade 2, or lower. At last follow-up, 13 patients (45%) are alive and remain free of progression. However, 16 patients (54%) had died: 12 (41%) due to progression of disease, 3 (10%) due to complications due to a subsequent allogenic transplant (graft versus host disease, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and bleeding) and 1 due to pneumonia. PFS was better in patients consolidated with autologous or allogeneic transplantation (100%) compared with patients not consolidated (14%) (p=0.009). PBSC collection after GemOx and G-CSF was successful for all of candidates. Conclusions: 1) GemOx regimen is effective in relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma with manageable toxicity; 2) Results are better in relapsed or chemosensitive disease compared to truly refractory cases; 3) No mobilization failures were observed; 4) Consolidation after response is needed.
