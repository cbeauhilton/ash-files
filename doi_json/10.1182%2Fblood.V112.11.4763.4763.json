    "abstract_text": "Hypoxia regulates erythropoiesis and other essential processes via hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs). HIFs are heterodimers that consist of an \u03b1 subunit (3 isotypes with significant homology; HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1, HIF-3\u03b1), and a common b-subunit; HIF-1 and HIF-2, in some instances exhibiting tissue- and gene-specific gene regulation. Erythropoietin ( EPO ) was the first identified HIF-1 target gene with the defined HIF-1 binding sequence. However, subsequent works suggested that HIF-2 also regulates EPO transcription and that there are other regulatory elements of EPO gene (i.e. Kidney Inducible Element KIE, Negative Regulatory Element NRE, and Negative Regulatory Liver specific Element NRLE). In silico analysis of the human EPO genome found two additional potential HIF-binding elements in the KIE and NRE regions. The comparative analysis of phylogenically conserved sequences of human, mouse, dog, and rat Epo genes further refined these mouse Epo gene HIF-binding elements as mKIE, mNRE1, mNRE2, and mNRLE2. We treated mice in hypoxia chamber (8% O 2 ) and monitored changes of Epo mRNA levels in liver, kidney, brain, spleen, and bone marrow. All tested tissues increased Epo transcription during hypoxia. Bone marrow, spleen, kidney, and brain showed a peak of induction of Epo transcript at 3 hours of hypoxia treatment, while liver reached the highest level at 6 hours. Mice were sacrificed and organs were harvested, and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIPs) was performed with antibodies against HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF- 2\u03b1 and tissue-specific binding regions were defined. The results from these studies are summarized below.  . HIF-1 . . mKIE . rnNRE . mNRE2 . mNRLE2 . . Norm . Hyp . Norm . Hyp . Norm . Hyp . Norm . Hyp . Liver \u2212 + \u2212 \u2212 + \u2212 ? ?

Further studies will be required to define the function of these HIF-1 and HIF-2 binding elements in tissue specific Epo expression and their role in health and disease.",
