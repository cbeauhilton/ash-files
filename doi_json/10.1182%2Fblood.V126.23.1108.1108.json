    "abstract_text": "Cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT) is a rare disease with significant neurological sequellae and high mortality rate. Incidence of CSVT diagnosis in the western world has increased despite the reduced occurrence of infectious sinus thrombosis related to otitis media and mastoiditis. The objective of this study was to identify risk factors that may explain the predisposition to the site specific thrombosis based on patients from a single tertiary medical center. The study included 90 consecutive patients aged 15 and up that were diagnosed with acute CSVT from January 2002 to September 2014 at the Sheba Medical Center. As a control group we used the data extracted from the national trauma registry for the years 2012 and 2013 and from Maccabi Healthcare Services, the second largest health care maintenance organization (HMO) in Israel. Trauma history up to one month prior to diagnosis of CVST was found in 13 (14%) patients (10 men and 3 women). Six patients had skull fractures, the others had blunt trauma. Data from the national trauma registry were used to compute annual age and gender specific head trauma rates. The overall SMR was 941 (p < 0.0001); the separate results for men and women were 1206 and 543, respectively. Another important risk factor was infections confined to the head and neck in 7% of the cases and brain tumor in 8%. At the time of CVST, 23 of 50 (46%) women had a hormonal risk factor. The SMR for OC use was 1.63 (p=0.0298). Prothrombotic polymorphisms were detected in 16 of 63 (25.4%) patients who were tested for factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutation (OR=3.47, p=0.002) in comparison to 49% in DVT patients (OR=9.95, p<0.0001). In 29 of 90 patients at least one of the risk factors for atherosclerosis (hypertension, diabetes or hypercholesterolemia) was discerned but this was very close to the expected number adjusted for sex and age and SMR was 0.98. None of the risk factors correlated with severity of disease and outcome. These data suggest that search for CVST in patients with recent trauma and headache even after intact head CT is required. The other risk factors, such as hormone related and prothrombotic polymorphisms, were not specific just for CVST and the latter play a lesser role in CVST than in DVT.
