    "abstract_text": "Activating mutations in the juxtamembrane domain or the activation loop of the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 occur in many cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but it is not known whether genomic alterations outside these regions contribute to leukemogenesis. High-throughput DNA sequence analysis has provided insights into the mutational profiles of various cancers and represents a promising strategy for the identification of novel therapeutic targets. However, recognizing the subset of genomic alterations that are functionally relevant has proven difficult. We used a high-throughput platform to interrogate the entire FLT3 coding sequence in a cohort of 222 adult AML patients without known FLT3 mutations and experimentally tested the functional consequences of each candidate leukemogenic allele by exogenous expression in BaF3 cells. DNA sequencing detected nine non-synonymous sequence variants in six exons that were not known single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Functional assessment of these alleles identified four novel activating mutations in the extracellular domain, the juxtamembrane domain, and the activation loop that induced constitutive kinase activity, differentially activated downstream signaling pathways, and conferred varying sensitivity to pharmacologic FLT3 inhibition. In contrast, the remaining five alleles, including mutations in highly conserved, key functional domains of FLT3, were not associated with increased kinase activity and aberrant signal transduction. These findings support the concept that acquired mutations in cancer may not contribute to malignant transformation, and underscore the importance of functional validation of candidate alleles discovered using high-throughput genomic screens, to distinguish between \u2018driver\u2019 mutations underlying cancer development, and biologically neutral \u2018passenger\u2019 alterations.",
