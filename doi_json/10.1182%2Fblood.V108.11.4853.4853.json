    "abstract_text": "Objective To explore the value of the technique of whole chromosome painting (WCP) and multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) in the detection of complex chromosomal aberrations (CCAs) of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Methods M-FISH was used in seven MDS patients with CCAs detected by R-banding technique to refine CCAs, and to identify cryptic translocations and characterization of marker chromosomes. Dual-color WCP procedures were further performed in 7 cases to confirm some rearrangements detected by M-FISH. Results In all cases, M-FISH confirmed all results of R-banding.The composition and origin of 6 kinds of marker chromosomes, 9 kinds of chromosomes with additional material undetermined and 5 kinds of derivative chromosomes undefined by CC were defined after M-FISH analysis; 4 kinds of cryptic translocations overlooked by CC were found on derivative chromosomes and previously normal appearing chromosomes. In addition, M-FISH revealed some nonrandom aberrations: aberrations involving chromosome 17 (5/7) and -5/5q- (4/7) were the two most frequent aberrations. Fluorescence flaring is a main factor leading to misinterpretations. Some misclassified and missed chromosomal aberrations by M-FISH were corrected by WCP. Conclusions M-FISH is a powerful molecular cytogenetic tool in clarification of CCAs. Complementary WCP helped us identify misclassified and missed chromosomal aberrations by M-FISH. CC in combination with molecular cytogenetic techniques M-FISH and WCP can unravel complex chromosomal aberrations more precisely.",
