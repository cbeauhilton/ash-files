    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1949 Introduction: There is extensive evidence from numerous studies in the transplant setting that achievement of complete response (CR) or at least very good partial response (VGPR) is significantly associated with prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In elderly myeloma patients CR was a rare event since new drugs has been added to standard melphalan-prednisone (MP). After the introduction of novel agents, CR represents an achievable goal, also outside of the transplant setting. Aims: to assess the impact of response to treatment on time-to-event parameters (PFS and OS) in elderly myeloma patients. Methods: We retrospectively analysed newly diagnosed myeloma patients, older than 65 years old, or younger but not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy and transplant. Patients were enrolled in 3 multicentre randomized European trials of the GIMEMA and Hovon groups, and were treated with MP (n=332), MP plus thalidomide (MPT, n=332), MP plus bortezomib (VMP, n=257) or MP plus bortezomib-thalidomide followed by bortezomib-thalidomide maintenance (VMPT-VT, n=254). PFS, OS and duration of CR were analysed by the Cox proportional hazards model, comparing the two arms by the Wald test and calculating 95% confidence interval (CI). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for the following variables: age at diagnosis (>75 vs. \u226475 yrs), International Staging System (ISS) stages, type of chemotherapy and best response achieved. Best response was treated as a time-dependent variable. Results: A total of 1,175 patients, enrolled from November, 2001 to January, 2009, were retrospectively analysed. The best response to treatment was available in 1,136 patients: CR was reported in 195, VGPR in 212, PR in 397. Baseline characteristics according to best response achieved in patients who obtained CR, VGPR or PR were similar. Since response rates vary according to treatment regimens the proportion of patients who received MP, MPT, VMP, and VMPT-VT was different in the different response categories. After a median follow-up of 29 months, PFS was significantly higher in patients who achieved CR compared to those who obtained VGPR (HR 0.16; 95% CI 0.10\u20130.24; p<0.001) or PR (HR 0.07; 95% CI 0.04\u20130.13; p<0.001). The advantage in PFS translated into an advantage in OS: patients obtaining CR have a significantly prolonged OS than patients who achieved VGPR (HR 0.15; 95% CI 0.08\u20130.28; p<0.001) or PR (HR 0.08; 95% CI 0.04\u20130.16, p<0.001), ( table ). In multivariate analysis CR achievement was as an independent predictor of longer PFS and OS, regardless of age, ISS stage, and treatment administered. In patients > 75 years, both PFS and OS were shorter as compared to younger patients. Despite these differences, the impact of CR on outcome was identical. In the subgroup of patients > 75 years, PFS was significantly prolonged in patients who achieved CR, compared with those who obtained VGPR (HR 0.26; 95% CI 0.12\u20130.58, p = 0.001) or PR (HR 0.20; 95% CI 0.10\u20130.41, p < 0.001). Accordingly, OS was significantly higher in patients who achieved CR, compared with those who obtained VGPR (HR 0.13; 95% IC 0.03\u20130.58; p = 0.007), or PR (HR 0.12; 95% IC 0.03\u20130.51, p = 0.004), (table). No significant PFS differences between patients obtaining CR during the first 6 months of treatment or later were seen (HR 1.06; 95% IC 0.49\u20132.27; p=0.878). Similarly, no OS differences between these two groups were detected (p = 0.676). Duration of CR was comparable in patients who obtained CR during or after the first 6 months of treatment (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.30\u20131.45; p = 0.305). Patients whose CR lasted more than 18 months have a significant OS benefit compared to patients who did not (p=0.006). Conclusions: These finding highlight the importance of CR, also outside of the transplant setting, regardless of age, ISS and treatment administered, and support the use of new drugs, also in patients older than 75 years, to achieve and maintain maximal response.
