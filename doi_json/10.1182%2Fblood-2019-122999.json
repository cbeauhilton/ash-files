    "abstract_text": "Telomerase is the ribonucleoprotein enzyme that has the main function of extension of telomeric repeat. Telomerase consists of two constructions: telomerase reverse transcriptase protein (hTERT) and RNA template. Inhibition of telomerase activity is considered to be a therapeutic approach for malignant tumors since telomerase is dominantly expressed in germ cells, stem cells, and cancer cells but not in normal cells. We found that (TTAGGG)n repeats could be integrated and repair artificially induced DNA double strand break (DSB) sites (Onozawa M et al. PNAS, 2014). Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of telomerase activity may interfere with the DNA repair process and enhance the effects of DNA damaging agents. Imetelstat competitively suppresses telomerase activity. It has a binding site complementary to the RNA template of telomerase and induces specific inhibition. Imetelstat showed clinical benefits in patients with essential thrombocytosis or myelofibrosis used as monotherapy. However, the effectiveness of imetelstat combined with other cytotoxic agent for hematological malignancies is not clear. We therefore evaluated the synergistic anti-tumor effects of imetelstat and cytotoxic agents on hematological malignancies. First, the expression of hTERT mRNA, protein, and activity was confirmed in 8 human cell lines of hematological malignancies (U937, HL60, PALL2, CEM, IM9, RPMI8226, ST1, and SU9T01) but not in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a healthy individual. There was a significant correlation between mRNA expression and activity measured by TRAP assay (r=0.839, 95% confidence interval: 0.396-0.965, p=0.00467). The expression of hTERT mRNA in clinical samples was analyzed using primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. The expression level of hTERT in ALL cells was significantly higher than that in AML cells (p=0.0093). The telomerase inhibitor, imetelstat had a concentration-dependent effect on telomerase inhibition, while a control oligo did not affect telomerase activity. The expression of hTERT protein was not suppressed by imetelstat treatment. Imetelstat also had a concentration-dependent suppressive effect on cell growth without affecting cell viability. Next, we evaluated the synergistic anti-tumor effects of etoposide and imetelstat at the concentration at which it did not affect cell growth by monotherapy. Cell proliferation at day 4 was inhibited by coadministration of etoposide (1 \u00b5M) and imetelstat (1 \u00b5M) compared to that with administration of etoposide alone (Figure A). Western blot analysis showed that gamma-H2AX expression level after radiation and imetelstat administration was significantly higher than that of after radiation alone (Figure B). Therefore, imetelstat enhanced DNA-DSB induced by a genotoxic agent. We determined whether the synergistic effect was mediated by shortening of telomere length. Telomere length was analyzed in long-term culture using the flow-FISH method. Imetelstat significantly shortened telomere length compared to a control oligo after day 14, while there was almost no change in telomere length at day 4. We also analyzed the changes of hTERT activity and gamma-H2AX expression after radiation in PBMCs from a healthy individual. Although hTERT activity was not detected in stable state in PBMC, hTERT activity appeared and gradually increased over time and gamma-H2AX expression peaked from 2 to 4 hours after radiation. Images of immunofluorescence staining revealed co-localization of hTERT and gamma-H2AX in the nucleus of PBMCs after radiation (Figure C). Therefore, hTERT induced by DNA damage might be directly involved in the DNA-DSB repair process. We clearly showed synergistic effects of imetelstat and a genotoxic agent in short-term treatment, in which shortening of telomeres was not observed. Potentially, telomerase inhibition could stand as a beneficial addition to other treatment methods when the inhibitor is administered at low non-toxic doses. Our hypothesis needs to be clarified in a clinical trial. Further studies are required to optimize these therapies in a variety of hematopoietic malignancies or other cancers.
