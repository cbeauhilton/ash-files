    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4337 Introduction Donor and recipient sex is an important factor that may influence outcomes of HLA-identical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The rationale of this study was to evaluate the impact of sex-related HY antigen mismatch on results of allo-HSCT from HLA-matched unrelated donors. Patients and Methods 92 patients treated with 10/10 HLA alleles-matched unrelated allo-HSCT performed in Hematology and BMT center in Katowice in years 2004-2006 entered the study. HY genotyping was performed in the Regional Blood Center with use of Dynal Minor Histocompatibility Antigen Typing Kit. Only immunogenic HY disparities were analysed. Results The estimated probability of immunogenic HY mismatches corrected by the frequency of restrictive HLA molecules was 34%. When HY was mismatched in GVH direction (female donor, male recipient), the incidence of cGVHD was increased (66% vs 38%, p=0.02), the relapse rate was decreased (6% vs 23%, p=0.046) and DFS tended to improve (79% vs 44%, p=0.067). Conclusions The sex-related HY antigen mismatches in GVH direction influence the results of allo-HSCT from HLA-matched unrelated donors. Results of this study may help to understand why sex difference between the donor and the recipient plays role in the allo-HSCT. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
