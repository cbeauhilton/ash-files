    "abstract_text": "To observe the efficacy and toxicity of two groups of MVEP Chemotherapy and R-MVEP Chemotherapy in patients of Refractory and relapsed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. 19 cases patients of refractory and relapsed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, 9 females and 10 male, between 17\u201375 years of age (mean age 45.5 years), 2 cases IIa,, 11caseIII (9IIIa and 2IIIb), 6 cases IV(4 IVa and 2 IVb).Most of patients showed the enlargement of superficial and/or deep multiple lymph nodes, 4 cases had fever and the enlargement of spleen and/or liver, 2 cases with hydrothorax and ascites, 3 cases with bone marrow infiltration and 1 case with multiple lumps in liver, other 1 case with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)and one with pericardial effusion. All patients were treated with chemotherapy included COP (or COPP), CHOP, BCAOP (or BECAOP), etc. and 2 patients of them Had been treated by radiotherapy before they were treated by MVEP Chemotherapy and R- MVEP Chemotherapy. In this experiment, A group of 13 patients were treated by MVEP Chemotherapy and G-CSF ( MVEP, Mitoxantrone 8mg/m 2 /d1, VP16 O.1/d1 \u2018d5 (or,Wumon 0.1/d1 \u2018d3),Vinorelbinum 20mg/m 2 /d1,Prednison 60mg/d1 \u2018d7,or DXM 8mg/m 2 d1 \u2018d7), other group of 6 patients were therapied by Rituximab plus MEVP Chemotherapy and G-CSF,( R-MVEP, Rituximab 375 mg/m 2 /d1,Mitoxantrone 8mg/m 2 /d3, Wumon 0.1/d3 \u2018d5 (or VP16 O.1/d3 \u2018d7),Vinorelbinum 20mg/m 2 /d3,Prednison 60mg/d3 \u2018d9 (or DXM 8mg/m 2 d3 \u2018d9 ), G-CSF 100 \u2018300/d were injected when the number of WBC was <2.0\u00d710 9 /L after chemotherapy. Each cycle was 28\u201335 days and assessment was given after 2 cycles. The result is, The overall response rate and complete remission was 61.5 % and 38.4% respectively in treat group of MVEP, The overall response rate and complete remission was 83.3% and 50 % respectively in group of R- MVEP. One of patients of NHL with AIHA after a treating cycle achieved complete remission(all of enlarged lymph nodes disappeared and Hemoglobin return to normal).The main toxicity was mylosuppression, the minimum of WBC after chemotherapy reached 0.5 \u20181.4*10 9 /L, few patients vomited during chemotherapy, All toxicity was no different in two groups of MVEP and R-MVEP BOur study result indicates: MEVP Chemotherapy and G-CSF is an Effective, safety and economy on patients of Refractory and relapsed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, but Rituximab in Combination with MEVP Chemotherapy and G-CSF is could improve the efficacy of MEVP Chemotherapy only in patients of Refractory and relapsed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. The efficacy of Rituximab in Combination with MEVP Chemotherapy is much better than that of MVEP Chemotherapy only on patients of Refractory and relapsed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, the treatment method of R-MVEP are suitable for old patients.",
