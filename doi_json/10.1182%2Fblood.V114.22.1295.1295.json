The in vivo rate of inhibition has been reported to be faster than the un-stimulated in vitro reaction between AT and free rFVIIa and of the same order of magnitude as the rate determined in the presence of tissue factor. To study the impact of AT inhibition on the elimination of rFVIIa in humans, we measured the pharmacokinetics (PK) of rFVIIa and rFVIIa-AT complex formation in 10 hemophilia A or B patients. Patients and Methods The PK of single-dose rFVIIa 90 \u03bcg/kg (Novo Nordisk A/S) was evaluated in 10 severe FVIII- or FIX-deficient patients in a non-bleeding state. The plasma concentrations of FVIIa activity (FVII:C), FVII antigen (FVII:Ag), FVIIa-AT, D-dimer and F1+2 fragment were determined immediately before, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours following rFVIIa dosing. Results Significant amounts of FVIIa\u2013AT complex were formed in vivo after rFVIIa administration, and reached a maximum of 5.4 \u00b1 0.8 nmol/L [mean \u00b1SD] at 2 hours following rFVIIa administration and declined to 4.4 \u00b1 0.9 nmol/L at 6 hours, as compared to 0.1 \u00b1 0.05 nmol/L at baseline. While the FVII:C PK data in this study were consistent with previous data, there was greater total body clearance (Cl tot ), a larger volume of distribution (Vd ss ) and a shorter plasma half-life (T 1/2 ) of FVII:C relative to FVII:Ag (Table). No change in D-dimer was observed after the administration of rFVIIa, while a slight increase in F1+2 fragment levels to 258 \u00b1 73 pmol/L was measured 4 hours after rFVIIa dosing, as compared to 141 \u00b1 45 pmol/L at baseline. Conclusion A significant divergence between the clearance of rFVIIa, as determined by either FVII:C or FVII:Ag measurements, can be accounted for by AT complex formation. Inhibition by AT appears thus to have a significant impact on the elimination of FVII:C activity from the circulation when rFVIIa is administered at a therapeutic dose. Similar to animal data, the formation of the FVIIa-AT complexes in vivo was faster than anticipated from in vitro studies, indicating that the exposure to the vessel wall stimulates the FVIIa inhibition by AT. Analyses of coagulation parameters did not indicate induction of systemic coagulation. Table PK parameters of FVII:C and FVII:Ag (n=10)  PK Parameter . FVII:C . FVII:Ag . P-Value .
