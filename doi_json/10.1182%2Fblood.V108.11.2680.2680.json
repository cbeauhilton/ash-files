    "abstract_text": "Background: acquisition of somatic mutations including JAK2 V617F or MPL W515L/K results in constitutive activation of JAK-STAT signaling that commonly characterizes myeloproliferative disorders (MPD). JAK2 is the central signaling mediator for most hematopoietic cytokines in this signaling pathway. Hypothesis: small molecule JAK2 inhibitors may have a therapeutic role in MPD regardless of JAK2 mutation status. Methods: We studied effects of the JAK2 inhibitor, TG101209, in a cell-free kinase assay, relevant cell lines, an in vivo phosphorylation assay, and primary cells from MPD patients carrying JAK2 V617F or MPL W515L/K mutations. Results: in a cell-free kinase assay, TG101209 inhibited JAK2 potently (IC 50 =6nM) and displayed selectivity relative to JAK3, ABL, and VEGFR2 kinases (IC 50 =170nM, 820nM, and 150nM, respectively). In cell proliferation assays, TG101209 inhibited JAK2-expressing Ba/F3 cells (IC 50 =280nM) and JAK2 V617F-homozygous human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells (IC 50 =300nM), but not BCR-ABL -carrying K562 cells (IC 50 >2\u03bcM). At 24 hours, TG101209 (600nM) induced apoptosis of HEL cells but not K562 cells (40% and 5%, respectively). SCID mice injected intravenously with Ba/F3- JAK2 V617F cells developed significant disease burden including massive splenomegaly due to tumor infiltration (day 12). We observed marked decrease in STAT5 phosphorylation in splenic tumors 5 hours after administration of 2 oral doses of TG101209 (50 mg/kg) in this in vivo model. Based on the above data, we plated patient-derived CD34+ cells in methylcellulose (0nM, 300nM, and 600nM TG101209) with and without cytokines. We studied 2 controls and 9 MPD patients: PV=5 (all JAK2 V617F+) and AMM=4 (3 were MPL W515L/K+) for colony number, colony size, and colony mutation burden, under each assay condition. TG101209 inhibited overall colony growth from MPD patients (IC 50 =300\u2013600nM), and it preferentially suppressed growth of mutant colonies relative to wild type in both of 2 MPL W515K+ patients (AMM1 and AMM2) and in 3 of 5 JAK2 V617+ patients (PV1-PV3) (Table). Conclusions: TG101209 potently inhibits cell growth that is dependent on constitutive JAK-STAT signaling. Furthermore, for MPD patient-derived cells, TG101209 preferentially suppresses growth of progenitors carrying JAK-activating mutations ( MPL W515K> JAK2 V617F> MPL W515L). Hence, our data supports the strategy of targeting aberrant JAK-pathway signaling in MPD as a viable therapeutic approach.  Patient . Mutation . IC 50 (nM) . No Drug (% colonies mutation-positive) .
