    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3544 Poster Board III-481 Objective To explore the impact and mechanism of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) infusion on immune reconstitution post murine allogeneic umbilical cord blood cell transplantation (UCBT) . Methods Mix cord blood was obtained at E19.5 from several litters of B6 females and was used as umbilical cord blood (UCB) graft. Thirty-two BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups with 8 mice per group in the first cohort UCBT, mice were reconstituted with PBS or 1\u00d710 6 , 2\u00d710 6 , 3\u00d710 6 UCB mononuclear cells (MNCs). Twenty-four BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to 3 groups with 8 mice per group in the second cohort UCBT, mice were injected with 1\u00d710 6 , 2\u00d710 6 or 3\u00d710 6 MNCs. All mice received platelet transfusion on +8d. Sixteen BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to 2 groups with 8 mice per group in the third cohort UCBT, mice were injected s.c. with KGF or PBS before TBI. All mice were injected with 2\u00d710 6 MNCs and were supported with platelet transfusion on +8d. We studied survival, splenic lymphoid cell subsets, sjTREC assay after UCBT. Results The survival rates at +100d of mice resconstituted with allogeneic 1\u00d710 6 , 2\u00d710 6 , 3\u00d710 6 UCB MNCs were 25%, 37.5% and 37.5% in the first cohort UCBT,respectively. The survival rates at +100d of mice injected with 1\u00d710 6 , 2\u00d710 6 , 3\u00d710 6 MNCs and with platelet support were 87.5%, 100.0% and 100.0%, respectively. The splenic T, NKT, NK and B cell counts in PBS treated control mice on +35d were (9.57\u00b10.74)\u00d710 6 , (0.64\u00b10.06)\u00d710 6 , (1.43\u00b10.10)\u00d710 6 and (19.13\u00b11.50)\u00d710 6 , respectively. While in KGF treated mice on +35d were (13.47\u00b10.74)\u00d710 6 , (0.89\u00b10.03)\u00d710 6 , (1.79\u00b10.04)\u00d710 6 and (20.50\u00b10.91)\u00d710 6 , respectively. The level of sjTREC in control mice was 182.2\u00b110.7copies per 10 5 cells Gwhile that of KGF treated mice was 224.2\u00b19.6 copied per 10 5 cells and was higher than that of control mice ( P =0.019). Conclusion Peripheral blood abtained from E19.5d fetus is rich in hematopoietic stem cells. We established a murine allogeneic UCBT model with platelet support on +8d. KGF treatment could enhance immune reconstitution after UCBT. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
