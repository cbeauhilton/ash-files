    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2749 Background: The long-term outcome of patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia treated with imatinib after failure of interferon alpha therapy has not been detailed. Patients and Methods: 368 patients were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses for survival were conducted using standard statistical methods. Results: Overall, 247 patients (67%) achieved complete cytogenetic response (CCyR). Of 327 patients studied, 207(63%) achieved major molecular response (MMR), and 99 (30%) had undetectable BCR-ABL levels at some time on therapy. The estimated 10-year survival rate was 68%, progression-free survival rate 67%, and event-free survival rate 51%. By multivariate analysis, age \u2265 60 years, hemoglobin < 10g/dl, marrow basophils \u2265 5%, any peripheral blasts, and clonal evolution were independent adverse factors for survival. The estimated 7-year survival by the presence of none (n=154), 1\u20132 (n=190), or \u2265 3 factors (n=24) were 93%, 70%, and 25% respectively (p <0.01). Achievement of MMR, CCyR, or partial cytogenetic response at 12 months were associated with significantly better 10-year survival rate by landmark analysis (10-year survival 80\u201390%) vs. achieving minor cytogenetic response or complete hematologic response (10-year survival 55\u201365%) vs. other response (10-year survival 10%). Using landmark analysis to include imatinib response at 12 months, achievement of major cytogenetic response or better (hazard ratio 0.12; p< 0.001) and complete hematologic response or minor cytogenetic response (hazard ratio 0.36; p=0.003) were significant favorable prognostic factors. Conclusions: The estimated 10-year survival rate of 68% in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia receiving imatinib after interferon failure has improved.
