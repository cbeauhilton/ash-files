    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1258 We previously reported that telomere shortening in a late generation telomerase K/O mouse model results in significantly reduced RBC and erythroblast (CD71+Ter119+) numbers in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, respectively. We also observed significant decreases in erythroid progenitor (Lin-cKit+Sca1-CD34-CD16/CD32-) and HSC (Lin-cKit+Sca1+ CD34-CD150+) numbers in G5 Tert\u2212/\u2212 mice. We now report the mechanism underlying the specific defect in the erythroid lineage in these mice. First, there is a higher number of CD34-KLS CD150lo and CD150neg cells in the mutant mice relative to age matched G0 +/\u2212 mice. Methyl cellulose colony formation assay showed that CD34-KLS CD150hi cells give rise to a greater number of CFU-GEMM colonies while CD34-KLS CD150lo and CD34-KLS CD150neg cells both had a reduction in the numbers of GEMM colonies, suggesting that the loss of erythroid differentiation is associated with loss of CD150hi expression within the CD34-KLS population. Thus, a significant reduction in CD150hi HSC (p value < 0.001) and an increase in CD150lo (p value < 0.001) and CD150neg (p value < 0.04) HSC in G5 Tert\u2212/\u2212 mice underlies the decreased number of erythroblasts in these mice. Secondly, we found that the reduction in telomere length as measured by quantitative PCR is greater in sorted erythroblasts (CD71+Ter119+) than in similarly purified myeloid progenitors (Gr1+Mac1+) in G5 Tert \u2212/\u2212 mice. This finding correlates with the presence of increased DNA damage and apoptosis in erythroid progenitors and erythroblasts as compared to myeloid progenitors. In order to establish a cause and effect relationship between telomere shortening and defective erythropoiesis, we reactivated telomerase activity using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase to excise a Lox-Stop-Lox cassette located in intron 2 of telomerase gene in G5 Tert\u2212/\u2212 mice. Reactivation of telomerase activity resulted in increased CD150hi HSC, erythroid progenitors and erythroblasts numbers in the bone marrow of these mice 3 months after tamoxifen treatment. In addition, RBC numbers and Hb levels in the peripheral blood improved in the treated mice, whereas neither improved in control G5 Tert\u2212/\u2212 mice treated with sunflower oil. These data show for the first time a direct link between the loss of telomerase function, telomere shortening and a selective defect in erythropoiesis. These results, in conjunction with single-cell \u201cmass cytometry\u201d experiments underway to define the intracellular signaling pathways that are affected in the HSC and erythroid precursors of G5 Tert\u2212/\u2212 mice, demonstrate the lineage-specific effects of telomere shortening on erythropoiesis and help to elucidate the relationship between shortened telomeres and the anemia of bone marrow failure syndromes.
