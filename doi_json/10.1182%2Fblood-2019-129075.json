    "abstract_text": "Besides \u03b1-granules and dense granules, which play critical roles in and beyond hemostasis, circulating blood platelets and their precursor cells megakaryocytes contain lysosomes, the contents of which are also secreted during platelet activation. In their delivery to the lysosome, acid hydrolases bearing phosphomannosyl residues are trafficked from the trans-Golgi network to the acidic late-endosomal compartment via the mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) pathway. To determine the role of M6PR-specific targeting of lysosomal enzymes in platelet function, platelet parameters were investigated in M6pr -/- mice lacking the 46-kDa M6PR, the physiological role of which is unclear. M6pr -/- mice had normal platelet count but displayed an increased number of distinct proplatelet-like cells compared to control mice, as determined by immunofluorescent microscopy. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of abnormal membrane tubulations, elongated and electron-dense granules, and large vacuole-like structures within resting M6pr -/- platelets. M6pr -/- platelets expressed normally major glycoproteins on their surface and von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen in their \u03b1-granules. M6pr -/- mice were hyper-thrombotic, as assessed by tail bleeding time, and M6pr -/- platelets adhered to type I collagen with a significantly greater propensity than control platelets under arterial shear in in vitro flow experiments. Heparanase, an endo-\u03b2-glucuronidase that cleaves extracellular matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycans, is the most abundant lysosomal enzyme in platelets. Thus, its contribution to the phenotype of M6pr -/- mice was investigated further. Heparanase expression was decreased in the bone marrow megakaryocytes and blood platelets of M6pr -/- mice and increased in M6pr -/- plasma, as evidenced by immunoblot and fluorescent microscopy analysis, consistent with its mistargeting in the absence of M6PR. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of heparanase with OGT 2115 normalized the adhesion of M6pr -/- platelets to collagen in vitro , indicating that increased plasma heparanase contributes to the thrombotic phenotype of M6pr -/- mice. Taken together, the data suggest that the M6PR-specific targeting of lysosomal heparanase plays a critical role in platelet function, thereby regulating hemostasis.
