    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1251 Several generic versions of enoxaparin have recently become available. While these generic versions of enoxaparin exhibit similar molecular profiles and comparable anti-Xa activities; product specific differences in global anticoagulant (APTT, Heptest and thrombin generation inhibition) have been reported. The purpose of this study was to compare a generic version of enoxaparin Sandoz from Argentina (Fibrinox lot 002) and from the US (enoxaparin lot 914786) in various in vitro whole blood and plasma based clotting tests. Despite comparable molecular profile and anti-Xa potency, product specific differences were noted between the products and the US generic enoxaparin showed a cumulatively stronger activity in most of the assays. To further test the pharmacodynamic profile of these products, individual groups of monkeys (n=4\u20138) were administered with each product at a 1 mg/kg SC and blood samples were collected for up to 28 hours. Clot based assays such as the APTT, Heptest, thrombin time, amidolytic anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities were carried out. In addition, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) antigen, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) activity and thrombin generation assays were also performed. Variable differences were noted in the clot based and amidolytic assays. Interestingly, the US generic product exhibited a lower release in the TFPI antigen whereas in the thrombin generation assays it produced a stronger inhibition of thrombin in terms of the AUC. TAFI activity profile also showed wide variations. These differences were more prevalent during the 1\u20134 hour time period. No differences were noted at >6 hours. The hysterisis PK/PD plots revealed marked differences between the two products. These results indicate that the products for the same generic suppliers may exhibit variations according to market places. Moreover, these observations underscore the need for a more stringent pharmacodynamic profile to demonstrate product equivalence. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
