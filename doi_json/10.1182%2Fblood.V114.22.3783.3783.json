    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3783 Poster Board III-719 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by an accumulation of mature, non functional B cells. WNT/\u03b2-catenin(CTNNB1)/TCF/Lef-1 signalling appears to be constitutively and aberrantly activated in these cells. Furthermore, several compounds related to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are reported to inhibit \u03b2-catenin stability and/or function in WNT active cancers in vitro . However, so far clinical studies with such substances generated disappointing results which is likely to the fact that therapeutic plasma concentrations could not be reached without producing significant toxicities; hence, the required high concentrations limit their clinical use. Recently, nitric oxide-donating acetylsalicylic acid (NO-ASA) has been shown to achieve high plasma levels in doses not leading to any relevant side effects in humans. In addition, NO-ASA could disrupt complexation of \u03b2-catenin and TCF-4 in vitro . Because the general structure of NO-ASA enables more variants, the aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of the para - (p-NO-ASA) and meta -isomer (m-NO-ASA) in CLL in vitro and in vivo . Primary CLL cells as well as healthy peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) and healthy B cells were treated with varying concentrations of p- and m-NO-ASA. Cytotoxicity was assessed by microscopic cell viability testing and measurement of the reduction of the ATP content. Induction of apoptosis was investigated by Annexin V-FITC/propidiumiodide staining and immunoblotting of the caspases-9, -3 as well as PARP. Further, the \u03b2-catenin protein amount and the expression of WNT effector proteins like cyclin D1 (CCND1), C-MYC and LEF-1 was evaluated by immunoblot analysis. In vivo activity of NO-ASA was evaluated by treating irradiated CD1 nu/nu female mice, containing a JVM-3 cell line xenograft, with 100 mg/kg/day of p- and m-NO-ASA or vehicle control p.o. for 3 weeks continuously. We found a significant concentration dependent reduction of the ATP content in CLL cells after treatment with p-NO-ASA, whereas the meta -isomer showed no effect on CLL cells. While healthy B cells and healthy PBMCs were not significantly affected by any of the isomers the mean lethal concentration (LC 50 ) was 4.64 \u03bcM in CLL cells. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining revealed that reduced cell survival occurs in a time and concentration dependent manner and is mediated by apoptosis. Treatment with 10 \u03bcM of p-NO-ASA for 24 hours reduced survival to 46.3 \u00b1 10.1%. This effect was achieved as early as 6 hours after treatment. Immunoblot analysis showed that only p-NO-ASA but not m-NO-ASA activates caspases-9, -3 and cleaves PARP at the same concentrations, which lead to induction of cell death. \u03b2-catenin protein levels and WNT pathway target genes are down regulated between 1 to 10 \u03bcM also only by the para -isomer. In vivo results revealed that exclusively p-NO-ASA show a strong antitumor efficacy with an IR max value of 83.1%. After 9 days of treatment p-NO-ASA lead to a significantly reduced tumor volume compared to vehicle control (126.4 \u00b1 22.3 mm 3 for p-NO-ASA vs. 290.0 \u00b1 65.9 mm 3 for the vehicle control, p =0.0303). Tumor volume of vehicle treated controls increased up to 775.4 \u00b1 219.6 mm 3 whereas the tumor volume of p-NO-ASA treated group remained stable at 128.7 \u00b1 27.6 mm 3 ( p =0.0091) over a treatment period of 21 days. The meta -isomer exhibited no significant antineoplastic effect. Our findings show that the para - but not the meta -isomer of NO-ASA selectively induces caspase mediated apoptosis in CLL cells. The mechanism of action might include inhibition of \u03b2-catenin/Lef-1 signaling since we observed downregulation of specific target gene expression. Due to our promising in vivo results, discovering a strong inhibition of tumor growth without producing gross side effects, p-NO-ASA might be a valuable compound for the treatment of CLL. More investigations of the mechanism of action and the specific difference between the positional isomers are needed. Disclosures: Hallek: Roche: Consultancy, Honoraria, Research Funding.",
