    "abstract_text": "Background: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare clonogenic disease of hematopoietic stem cells. LncRNAs has a wide range of biological functions, including cell differentiation, cell proliferation and substance metabolism. LncRNAs maybe contribute to the proliferation of PNH clones. Methods: CD59 - and CD59 + granulocytes and monocytes cells were sorted by FCM and analyzed by RNA sequencing in 5 PNH patients. We focus on the proliferation relative pathway-NF-\u03baB pathway. The mRNAs which FPKM>10 and over 3 patients were chosen to search out the upstream regulation LncRNAs. Then the expression of LncRNAs were detected by qRT-PCR in 30 PNH patients. The highly expressed LncRNA FAM157C was screened out, and analyzed the correlation with clinical index. Finally, we knock-down FAM157C gene in the PIGA knocked out THP-1 cells by lentivirus transfection technique, and observe the cell proliferation, apoptosis to verify its function. Results: Transcription analysis revealed that 742 upregulation LncRNAs and 3276 upregulation mRNAs were identified in CD59 - cells (Figure A). The highly expressed NF-\u03baB pathway (Figure B) mRNAs were analysed by co-expression, after that MALAT1, LINC01002, FAM157C, CTD-2530H12.2, XLOC-064331 and XLOC-106677 were concerned with the 8 mRNAs (Figure C). The results showed that the levels of MALAT1 and FAM157C in CD59 - cells expression were significantly higher than that of the CD59 + cell in 30 PNH patients ( p <0.05). The expression level of MALAT1 and FAM157C were positive correlation with LDH level and CD59 - granulated and monocytes cells ratio (Figure D). Lentivirus FAM157C transfection knock-down FAM157C gene expression (90%) in the PIGA knocked out THP-1 cells. The cell proliferation assay results showed that there was no significant change in the cell viability at 24h after transfection. But with the transfection time, the cell proliferation activity showed a decreasing trend. The cell viability of the control group, empty virus group and FAM157C knock-down group were (100\u00b10), (93.75\u00b15.995), (77.49\u00b16.597) and (100\u00b10), (92.795\u00b15.802), (60.47\u00b12.059) after 48h, 72h transfection respectively ( p =0.0069, 0.0002) (Figure E). The apoptosis rate of control group, empty virus group and FAM157C knock-down group were (2.483\u00b10.3083)%, (2.926\u00b10.5517)%, (6.256\u00b10.5453)% and (5.593\u00b10.6400)%, (6.723\u00b10.3256)%, (11.30\u00b11.075)% and (9.797\u00b10.3235)%, (10.21\u00b10.3005)%, (18.81\u00b10.5363)% after 24h, 48h, 72h transfection respectively ( p =0.0006, 0.0005, < 0.0001). The cell apoptosis experiment showed that apoptosis rate increased after transfection of lentivirus FAM157C (Figure F). The results of cell cycle test showed that the G0/G1 phase of the control group, empty virus group and FAM157C knockdown group were (62.98\u00b11.513)%, (65.95\u00b11.174)% and (70.00\u00b10.2404)%, S phase were (3.825\u00b10.7849)%, (5.920\u00b10.9192)% and (13.47\u00b11.039)%, G2 phase were (32.81\u00b11.612)%, (27.47\u00b11.160)% and (16.54\u00b10.7990)% after transfection of lentivirus FAM157C ( p =0.0269, 0.0198, 0.0145) (Figure G). Conclusion: High expressed FAM157C was associated with hemolysis index in PNH, and knock-down it can decrease proliferation ability, induce the apoptosis and the cells were blocked in G0/G1 phase and S phase, indicating FAM157C may be involved in the proliferation of PNH clones.
