    "abstract_text": "Introduction Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell cancer. People introduced the concept of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in MM, known as MM-CSCs, to characterize a small population of malignant cells with distinguishable activities of self-renewal and differentiation into regular MM cells. In this study, we showed that activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) interacted with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). ALCAM-EGFR axis regulated MM-CSC mediated myelomagenesis and chemoresistance. Methods MM-CSCs in MM cell lines and primary MM cells were identified by Hoechst staining or ALDEFLUOR dye, followed by flow cytometry analyses. MM-CSC clonalization activity was examined by soft agar colony formation assay. The protein-protein interaction was identified by co-immunoprecipitation, proximity ligation assay, and proteins' structure simulation. MM-CSC mediated myelomagenesis in vivo was examined in human MM xenograft mouse model and murine adoptive MM model. MM-CSC mediated chemoresistance in vivo was examined using 5T MM model. The clinical significance of ALCAM expression in MM was analyzed using patients' gene expression profiles. Results Both MM cell lines and primary MM cells expressed ALCAM. When cultured with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) or in BMSC-conditioned medium, ALCAM knocked down (AL-KD) MM cells exhibited increased colony formation activity. Hoechst staining showed that under such culture conditions, AL-KD MM cells had increased stemness side population (SP), which was MM-CSC. Depletion of MM-CSC reduced MM colony formation activity. In human MM xenograft model, subcutaneous co-injection of AL-KD MM cells and BMSCs had large amount of MM-CSC and fast tumorigenesis. In murine adoptive MM model, which had tumor derived from viral transformed plasma cells with mandatory expression of MYC, KRAS genes and a shRNA sequence, ALCAM shRNA expression resulted significant more rapid tumor development than non-target shRNA. Mechanistic studies showed that ALCAM and EGFR co-immunoprecipitated in MM cells. Proximity ligation assay showed interaction of ALCAM and EGFR in primary MM cells. Immunofluorescent staining showed that ALCAM colocalized with unphosphorylated EGFR in MM. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), the canonical ligand of EGFR, stimulated EGFR phosphorylation and abolished ALCAM-EGFR colocalization. Protein structure simulation suggested that EGF and ALCAM mutual exclusively bound to the same region of EGFR. EGF addition stimulated MM-CSC in cultured MM. Inhibitors of EGFR, ERK, or hedgehog pathway repressed MM-CSC. EGFR activation led to hedgehog pathway activation via RAS/MEK/ERK cascade, while ALCAM inhibited such pro-MM-CSC cell signaling by binding to EGFR. Chemotherapeutics, such as bortezomib and melphalan, induced MM apoptosis, but also stimulated MM-CSCs, which were resistant to chemotherapeutics. Although CTR-KD and AL-KD MM had similar death rate after the drug treatment, AL-KD MM cells had more MM-CSC generated. MM-CSCs derived in AL-KD MM cells had more active cell proliferation even in the presence of drugs. Further study showed that chemotherapy stimulated EGFR expression and repressed ALCAM expression, therefore switched the balance of ALCAM-EGFR axis to pro-MM-CSC direction. EGFR inhibitors, such as gefitinib, did not have anti-MM activity, but repressed MM-CSCs. In 5T MM model, Gefitinib/melphalan combination therapy resulted prolonged remission period, and significant better mouse survival. We identified MM-CSC in patients BM. ALCAM expression correlated with MM overall survival (OS): ALCAM high patients had better OS. In ALCAM-EGFR axis, only ALCAM expression, but not EGFR expression, correlated with MM OS. ALCAM expression varied in different patients, while EGFR expression was more even. Therefore we believe in ALCAM-EGFR axis, it was ALCAM, but not the EGFR, that played the regulatory role. Furthermore, pathway enrichment analysis showed that MM-CSC, identified by Hoechst staining, and MM minimum residual disease (MRD) shared similarities in signaling pathways, as well as pattern of ALCAM expressions. Conclusion and Discussion ALCAM-EGFR axis regulates MM-CSC mediated myelomagenesis and chemoresistance. EGFR inhibitors repress chemoresistant MM-CSC. Combination therapy with conventional chemotherapeutics and an EGFR inhibitor might be promising in MM treatment. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
