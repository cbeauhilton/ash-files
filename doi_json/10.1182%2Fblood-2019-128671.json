    "abstract_text": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) ultimately will progress to a higher-risk form or acute myeloid leukemia. This evolution is accompanied by acquisition of genetic hits following ancestral mutations, with further subclonal diversification of the clonal architecture. Conceptually, therapeutic approaches targeting ancestral hits have the potential to eradicate MDS at early stages of ontogenesis. Founder SF3B1 mutations are frequent in MDS and therefore represent rational targets for drug development. During our drug discovery efforts we identified an existing drug that selectively inhibits the growth of SF3B1 mutant ( SF3B1 MT ) cells. We consequently examined the effects of known compounds possibly arresting clonal expansion of SF3B1 MT MDS cells. For our studies, we generated CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in human cells stably expressing the recurrent SF3B1 K700E mutation and a chromophore-tagged reporter (mRFP). Because of the high frequency of SF3B1 mutations and their effects on the splicing of a multitude of genes, we hypothesized that some of the corresponding downstream effects could be effectively targeted. Using luminescent cell viability assays and flow cytometry analysis, we screened a 3,000 compound library for selective sensitivity against isogenic SF3B1 MT cells. A subset of this library contained 23 calcium 2+ channel blockers (CCBs) of which one specific dihydropirimidine (DHP) showed the highest inhibitory activity against SF3B1 MT cells. Several studies point towards a role of calcium signaling in MDS. Proteins active in calcium metabolism (GPR68, calpain, calpastatin) are involved in modulating sensitivity to drugs used in MDS (e.g., lenalidomide). Divalent substrates including Fe 2+ may use CCs and it's plausible that our DHP can inhibit iron overload by blocking Fe 2+ trafficking through L-type CCs. In this regard, CCBs have been shown to stimulate the activity of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Furthermore, it is known that the SF3B1 mutations reduce the expression of the iron transporter ABCB7, leading to increased iron accumulation. All of this led us to further evaluate the effects of DHP in vitro and in vivo . DHP had higher growth inhibitory activity against SF3B1 MT cells when tested in vitro using 8 serial concentrations in half-log dilutions for a period of 3 days (20% and 60% growth inhibition at 1 and 3\u03bcM). Mixed competitive experiment of K700E mRFP and WT GFP cells treated with increased doses of DHP (1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50 \u03bcM) reduced the competitiveness of K700E mRFP over the time inducing a 3-fold reduction at 50\u03bcM. K700E mRFP cells expressed half the amount of ABCB7 mRNA compared to WT GFP cells by RT-PCR. Therapeutic index provided by DHP was determined in vivo . Bone marrow cells of B6. Gt(ROSA)26 Sortm1Sor/J (CD45.2) donors were transplanted in pre-lethally irradiated B6.SJL- Ptprc a Pepc b /BoyJ (CD45.1) recipients. Two weeks after transplantation, average engraftment (measured as percentage of CD45.2(+) donor cells) was 96% \u00b1 0.02. DHP (10 mg/Kg) was orally administered. No decrease in the proportion of CD45.2(+) donor cells was seen post-treatment compared to pre-treatment (96\u00b10.01 % vs. 96%\u00b10.009). Similarly no change in the proportion of CD45.2(+) donor cells was observed in competitive repopulation experiments when B6. Gt(ROSA)26 Sortm1Sor/J cells were mixed 1:1 with transgenic Sf3b1 +/K700E cells (40%\u00b10.13 vs. 44%\u00b10.02). In contrast, preliminary experiments showed that DHP had an effect on reducing Sf3b1 +/K700E allele burden in two chimeric mice (to 21% and 24%) compared to pre-treatment. DHP is structurally unique in comparison to other DHP-based CCBs; in that it possess a -CH 2 0-CH 2 CH 2 NH 2 moiety linked directly to the DHP scaffold that may in itself provide opportunities or modes for Fe 2+ chelation as well as its L-type CCB activity. Our observations and structural analyses therefore provide impetus to explore this feature to possibly improve the drug's efficacy. In sum, we have demonstrated that the clonal growth of cells carrying SF3B1 mutations might be suppressed using the known L-type CCB DHP. This might represent a novel modulator of ATPase activity of ABC transporters in SF3B1 MT expressing low ABCB7 levels.
