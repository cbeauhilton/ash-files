    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5087 Background: Cancer-testis antigens (CTA) are attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy based on their tumor-restricted expression and immunogenicity. A number of CTA, including Melanoma-associated antigen 3 (MAGE-A3), are already under clinical investigation and CTA have been shown to induce strong T cell and humoral immunity in cancer patients receiving active immunotherapy. However, little is known about the fine specificity and the function of vaccine-induced humoral immune responses and it is unclear how they relate to spontaneous CTA-specific immune responses occurring in a minority of patients. Methods: We have performed a longitudinal analysis of spontaneously occurring antibody responses against the CT antigen MAGE-A3 in sera (N=1537), which were collected from patients with multiple myeloma (N=355) over a period of 6 years. Antibody titers were determined by ELISA technique and a B cell ELISPOT assay was applied to estimate the number of MAGEA3-specific memory B cells in peripheral blood of the patients . Fine specificity of the antibody responses was examined using overlapping 20mer peptides spanning the whole sequence of MAGE-A3. The given IgG subtype was determined, and the quality of MAGE-A3-specific antibodies was analyzed using western blot as well as affinity assays. Results were compared to those obtained with MAGE-A3-specific antibody responses induced by vaccination with full-length MAGE-A3 protein and adjuvants AS02B or AS15 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; N=15). Results: Out of 355 myeloma patients 4 (1.1%) evidenced spontaneous antibody responses against MAGE-A3 at least at one point during the course of their disease. Spontaneously occurring anti-MAGE-A3 humoral responses were usually of low titer. In contrast, all of the vaccinated patients showed high-titered and persisting antibody responses which usually appeared around week 6 after the first application of the vaccine. Accordingly, we found high frequencies of vaccine-induced MAGE-A3-specific memory B cells in the peripheral blood of NSCLC patients while they remained undetectable in most myeloma patients. Vaccine-induced antibody responses underwent affinity maturation reaching affinity levels of spontaneous immune responses after repeated cycles of treatment. MAGE-A3-specific antibodies consisted of IgG1 and IgG3>IgG2>IgG4 subtypes in vaccinated patients whereas spontaneously occurring antibodies were mainly of the IgG2 subtype. Spontaneous as well as vaccine-induced IgG antibodies both recognized the natural full-length protein. Analysis of the fine specificity of the antibody responses revealed that vaccine-induced antibodies recognized a much larger number of MAGE-A3 epitopes than spontaneously occurring antibodies. However, both, spontaneous as well as vaccine-induced responses, most frequently and strongly recognized a specific region within the MAGE-A3 protein corresponding to amino acids 51\u201370. Conclusions This study demonstrates for the first time important qualitative differences between spontaneously occurring and vaccine-induced antibody responses against the MAGE-A3 antigen in cancer patients. While the potential of both types of antibody responses to promote antigen uptake and induction of T cell responses by antigen-presenting cells might differ, they both recognized the same restricted region within the MAGE-A3 protein. The latter finding might be of importance for the design of future immunotherapies targeting MAGE-A3. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
