Methods In the present multicenter cohort study we evaluated the impact of i) treatment intensity [median individual dose administered during the first 6 to 8 weeks] and ii) type of factor VIII product [plasma-derived (pd); recombinant-derived (r)] on the risk of high-titre inhibitor development in 150 previously untreated patients with severe hemophilia A (HA) consecutively ascertained between 1982 and 2007 from five German catchment areas. Patients were followed over a period of 200 exposure days from HA onset. Study endpoint was inhibitor-free survival time related to treatment with adjustment for treatment period. Plasma levels of factor VIII were determined by one-stage clotting assays. Inhibitor testing was performed at least monthly to 3 monthly when on therapy using the Bethesda method or its modification [Nijmegen]: The lower detection limit was set at 0.6 Bethesda units [BU]. A peak inhibitor titer of > 5 BU was defined as high responder [HR]. A positive inhibitor testing was stated when an inhibitor was measured at least in two independent follow-up visits. The cumulative inhibitor-free survival was calculated using multivariate Cox regression [hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]]. Results During the follow-up period 30 of 150 children (20.0%) developed a high titre inhibitor. In univariate analysis the median dose increase per IU/kgbw significantly increased the hazard towards HR inhibitor development [HR/CI: 1.08/1.05-1.11]. In addition, 14 of 52 children treated with rFVIII concentrates (27%) versus 16 of 98 children (16.3%) treated with pdFVIII concentrates developed HR during the observation period [HR/CI: 1.9/0.9-3.9]. In multivariate analysis treatment intensity adjusted for FVIII products and treatment period were independently associated with the development of clinical meaningful inhibitors [HR/95%CI: 1.08/1.1-1.1]. Conclusion Data presented here support the hypothesis that clinical meaningful inhibitor development is of multifactorial origin and that treatment intensity plays a major role.
