    "abstract_text": "The platelet integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is the prototypic example of regulated integrin function. Thus, \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is inactive on unstimulated platelets, but switches to an active conformation following platelet stimulation. Recent experiments suggest that disruption of the heteromeric association of the \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 transmembrane (TM) and/or cytoplasmic domains shifts \u03b1IIb\u03b23 from an inactive to an active conformation. However, structural information about these heteromeric associations is sparse. Thus far, the structure of the TM heterodimer has only been studied by molecular modeling. Although interactions between soluble cytosolic tail peptides have been studied by NMR spectroscopy, these studies may not reflect native contacts because they fail to account for constraining TM domain interactions. To obtain an NMR structure for the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 cytosolic tail heterodimer that reflects its native structure, we expressed 13C- and 15N-labeled peptides corresponding to \u03b1IIb residues 988-1008 and \u03b23 residues 713-762 in E. coli. Residues 987 in \u03b1IIb and 712 in \u03b23 were replaced with cysteines, based on modeling that predicted that a disulfide bond between these residues will fix the peptides in their native orientation. The peptides were disulfide-crosslinked using 2,2\u2032-dithiobis(5-nitropyridine) chemistry, dissolved in dodecylphosphocholine micelles at pH 6.5, and NMR data were collected at 37 \u00b0C on a 750 MHz spectrometer. Currently, >98% of the complex\u2019s peptide backbone and >90% of its side chains have been assigned. When compared to published chemical shift data for the monomeric \u03b23 cytoplasmic tail, there were no differences for residues 725\u2013741 and 747\u2013762. However, there were chemical shift differences between the \u03b1IIb/\u03b23 heterodimer and the \u03b23 monomer for the membrane-embedded region of the \u03b23 peptide, residues 713\u2013724, suggesting that this region interacts with \u03b1IIb. Similarly, chemical shifts for the monomer and heterodimer were different for \u03b23 residues 742\u2013746. This region of \u03b23 contains an NPXY motif and is a site at which the \u03b23 cytoplasmic tail interacts with signaling and structural proteins. This result implies that the shift from heterodimer to monomer causes a structural change in this region, perhaps enabling it to interact with other proteins. Finally, we observed arginine side chain protons on the \u03b1IIb subunit. Arginine protons are usually not observable by NMR and their detection may reflect the existence of a salt bridge involving arginine. The \u03b1IIb cytoplasmic tail contains two arginine residues, one of which, Arg995, is predicted to form a salt bridge with \u03b23 Asp723. Although the detected arginine protons could belong to Arg995 and/or Arg997, they displayed an NOE with the \u03b23 Asp723 amide, a finding consistent with the predicted \u03b1IIb Arg995-\u03b23 Asp723 salt bridge. In conclusion, we have characterized the structure of a disulfide-crosslinked \u03b1IIb/\u03b23 cytoplasmic tail heterodimer using NMR spectroscopy and compared our results to prior work on the \u03b23 cytoplasmic tail monomer. Our analysis indicates that when constrained by a proximal disulfide bond, the \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 cytoplasmic tails interact, providing one mechanism for maintaining \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in an inactive state."
