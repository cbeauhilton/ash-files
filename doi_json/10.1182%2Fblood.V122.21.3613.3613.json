    "abstract_text": "Introduction Three trials, F13CD-1725, F13CD-3760 and F13CD-3720 have investigated the pharmacokinetics (PK) of recombinant FXIII (rFXIII), given at a dose of 35 IU/kg once monthly, in a total of 54 patients with FXIII congenital deficiency (Inbal A et al Blood 2012;119(22):5111-5117; Williams M et al Haemophilia 2013;DOI:10.1111/hae.12224 ; Kerlin B et al JTH 2013;11(Suppl 2):235-236). The aim of the current analysis was to assess and compare the PK characteristics of rFXIII among trials and 3 different age groups of patients (1-<6, 6-17 and \u226518 years). Methods All patients were dosed with rFXIII 35 IU/kg every 4 th week. Blood samples for PK assessments were collected regularly throughout the dosing interval (28 to 30-day period) in the 3 trials: in the pivotal phase 3 trial, F13CD-1725, at 1 hour, 14 and 28 days post-dose; in the paediatric F13CD-3760 trial at 0.5 and 24 hours and 7, 14, 21 and 30 days post-dose; and in the F13CD-3720 phase 3 extension trial at 1 and 2 hours and 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days post-dose. Prior to the PK assessment, all but 2 patients had received treatment with repeated doses of either plasma derived FXIII products or rFXIII, thus all PK measurements were performed at steady-state. The Berichrom \u00ae FXIII activity assay was used for measurement of FXIII activity. PK parameters were calculated using non-compartmental statistical methods, without baseline adjustment. The results include data from a total of 54 patients, aged 1 to 60 years; 41 in the F13CD-1725 trial, 23 in the F13CD-3720 trial (including 16 patients who also participated in F13CD-1725), and 6 in the F13CD-3760 trial. Results The non-compartmental PK parameters (C max , C trough , AUC 0-28/30d , t 1/2 ) were similar across the 3 age groups ( Table 1 ). Post-hoc, pairwise t-tests across the age groups of log-transformed data did not demonstrate any statistically significant differences, when adjusting p-values for multiple testing. Additionally, separate ANOVA analyses of each of the parameters, showed no significant differences across the groups. The geometric mean half-life ranged from 11.6 to 15.0 days ( Figure 1 ), and the trough FXIII activity levels ranged from 0.15 to 0.21 IU/mL ( Figure 2 ). The geometric mean recoveries were also in the same range; 0.015 (F13CD-1725), 0.013 (F13CD-3760) and 0.020 (F13CD-3720) (IU/mL)/(IU/kg). Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that the mean PK profiles were similar for the 3 trials, and that C max and C trough values, as well as FXIII exposures (AUC), were constant over time, based on results from patients participating in both the F13CD-1725 and the F13CD-3720 trial.

It was further demonstrated that FXIII trough activity levels were constant over time, when comparing the individual levels of FXIII activity in patients participating in both the F13CD-1725 and the F13CD-3720 trials. Despite rather large individual variation (CV of up to 38%) in the maximal FXIII activity levels, all individual mean trough activity levels were above 0.1 IU/mL during the entire duration of the trials. The results support that monthly dosing with 35 IU/kg of rFXIII to patients with FXIII subunit A deficiency, regardless of age, is adequate for prophylaxis. Nevertheless individual PK measurements to determine optimal dose and dosing frequency should be considered due to patient variation.
