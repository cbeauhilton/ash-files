    "abstract_text": "In the US, iron-restricted anemia contributes greatly to morbidity. The erythroid iron deprivation response, characterized by a pathway in which erythropoiesis is suppressed during iron restriction, underlies this anemia. In preliminary studies, liver kinase B1 (LKB1) was implicated as a potential key component in the erythroid iron deprivation response. Normal human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells cultured for 3 days in erythroid medium with 100% or 10% transferrin saturations underwent immunoblot of whole cell lysates. Reproducibly, the levels of LKB1 did not change based on the transferrin saturation; however, immunofluorescence imaging showed a shift in subcellular localization when cells were subjected to low iron conditions. To assess the effects of LKB1 loss in the erythroid compartment, we used control and LKB1 conditional knockout ( STK11 F/F ; EpoR-Cre+ ) mice. In steady-state conditions, the loss of LKB1 does not confer a change in RBC count, though, there is a baseline increase in the number of reticulocytes, and a large increase in the level of serum Erythropoietin (Epo). In a model to precipitate anemia, these mice were challenged with intraperitoneal injection of phenylhydrazine (PHZ). It was found that LKB1 is dispensable for an appropriate response to this type of stress erythropoiesis. To assess the impact of LKB1 on maturation, we performed flow cytometric analysis using an ex vivo culture system of splenic erythroblasts. LKB1-deficient erythroid progenitors show increased percentages of more advanced cells as evidenced by the surface markers CD71 and Ter119 (the mouse analogue of human glycophorin A). Current studies are underway to assess if this change is due to signaling through the AMPK pathway. These studies will provide mechanistic detail of LKB1 function and activity on erythropoiesis, improving our understanding of programs involved in maturation of differentiation and lineage selection which may ultimately help to improve health outcomes and advance treatment for various types of anemias.
