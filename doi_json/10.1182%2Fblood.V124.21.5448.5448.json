    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Though widely used and accepted as a first line regimen, published data regarding R-CODOX-M/IVAC is very limited. Up to date only three prospective studies and one case series have been reported. Herein, we present our institution\u2019s experience with the management of Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with a special emphasis on the R-CODOX-M/IVAC regimen. METHODS: The files and electronic records of 35 patients diagnosed with Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma between January 2005 and June 2014 were retrospectively revised. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 40 (21-86 years). Male patients constituted 71.4 (n=25). Stage IV disease was present in 60.6% (n=20), and stage I disease in 27.3% (n=9) of the patients. ECOG performance scoring was < 3 in 70.6% (n=24) and Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma risk scoring (availability of complete surgical resection, stage, serum LDH and CNS involvement) > 2 in 58.6% (n=17). The distribution of patients to administered regimens were as follows: R-CODOX-M/IVAC 10 patients (28.6%), HyperCVAD 5 patients (14.3%), R-CHOP 9 patients (25.7%), R-CVP 2 patients (5.7%), CALGB 10002 1 patient (2.9%) and other regimens (high dose methotrexate, high dose cytarabine, vincristine-prednisolone, etc.) 8 patients (23.0%). Median overall survival (OS) was 23.5 (1-114) months and median progression free survival was 17.0 (0-114) months. Relapses occurred in 7 patients (20.0%), mortality in 12 patients (34.3). R-CODOX-M/IVAC group (n=10) was compared to other rituximab containing regimens (R-CHOP, R-CVP) (n=11) and HyperCVAD (n=5) and other rituximab-free regimens (n=9) with respect to patient and disease characteristics, DFS and OS. The disease stage, ECOG performance score and Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma risk score were similar between the four groups (p=0.6, p=0.2 and p=0.2, respectively). However, median OS was 13 (1-42) months in R-CODOX-M/IVAC group and it was significantly lower than other regimens (p=0.04 log rank test). Median PFS was 13 (0-42) months and also lower compared to other regimens, however, the difference was not statistically significant (p=0,1 log rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma is currently one of the most aggressive mature B- cell origin lymphomas and there is no consensus on the standard of care. CODOX-M/ IVAC is one of the most frequently used regimen. Adding rituximab is also known to prolong overall survival in this patient population. Though the sample sizes are too small and the drawbacks of the retrospective study design exist, the inferior OS and PFS observed in this study with R-CODOX-M within patients having similar disease characteristics should be taken into account. Further studies comparing the efficiency of currently used regimens are needed to reach a clear conclusion.
