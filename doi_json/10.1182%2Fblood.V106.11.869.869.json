    "abstract_text": "The class III receptor tyrosine kinase, FLT3, is expressed by over 90% of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) blasts. In addition, it is expressed at extremely high levels in ALL patients with MLL-rearrangements or hyperdiploidy and sometimes mutated in these same patients. In this report, we investigated the effects of EB10, an anti-human FLT3 monoclonal antibody capable of preventing binding of FLT3 ligand (FL), on ALL cell lines and primary cells. In vitro studies, examining the ability of EB10 to inhibit FLT3 activation and downstream signaling in ALL cell lines and primary blasts, yielded variable results. In some cell lines FLT3 phosphorylation was inhibited and with it, downstream activation of pathways involving MAPK, AKT, and STAT5 phosphorylation. However, several cell lines actually exhibited FLT3 activation upon antibody treatment, possibly because of antibody-mediated receptor dimerization, and subsequent activation of downstream pathways. Nevertheless, through antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) such an antibody could still prove efficacious against leukemia cells in vivo. In fact, EB10 treatment significantly prolongs survival and/or reduces engraftment of several ALL cell lines and some primary ALL samples in NOD/SCID mice, even when EB10 treatment results in FLT3 activation of those cell lines in vitro. Moreover, FACS and PCR analysis of EB10 treated NOD/SCID mice surviving 150 days post leukemic cell injection revealed that FLT3 immunotherapy eliminated leukemic engraftment. The leukemic cells surviving EB10 treatment in the mice were characterized by FACS analysis and found to express lower levels of FLT3. To assess for resistance, cells surviving EB10 treatment were injected into NOD/SCID mice and treated with a single dose of EB10. FACS analysis revealed that these cells remain sensitive to EB10 treatment. Taken together, these data demonstrate that EB10 is cytotoxic to ALL blasts in vivo and EB10 treatment did not select for resistant clones. Such an antibody, either naked or conjugated to radioactive isotopes or cytotoxic agents, may prove useful in the therapy of infant ALL as well as childhood and adult ALL patients whose blasts typically express FLT3.",
