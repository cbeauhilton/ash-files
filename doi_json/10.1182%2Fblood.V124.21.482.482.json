    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: AML in elderly patients, secondary AML and/or AML with complex karyotype respond poorly to conventional intensive chemotherapy (CT) and have a poor prognosis. In those patients, however, AZA can bring some benefit, especially in the absence of adverse cytogenetics, if WBC < 15 \u00d7 10\u2079/L and performance status (PS) < 2 (Thepot, Am J Hemat, 2014; Pleyer Ann Hematol, 2014). Whether molecular findings can predict outcome in AML receiving first line AZA (as they do in AML receiving CT) is however unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 96 AML patients who received between 2007 and 2012 first line treatment with AZA (75mg/m 2 /d x 7 d/4 weeks SC for a median of 7 cycles, range 1-33) in 8 French centers were retrospectively analyzed. Initial response was evaluated based on blood and marrow examination after 4 -6 cycles of AZA. We analyzed the impact on overall survival (OS) of conventional clinico-biological parameters, and molecular biology parameters including EVI1 expression, MLL -PTD, and the mutational status of 16 genes analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing: ASXL1, CEBPA, DNMT3A, EZH2, FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, NPM1, NRAS, KRAS, RUNX1, SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, TET2, and TP53 . RESULTS: Median age was 73 (range, 44-88). Median PS was 1 (range, 0-3). 55% patients had secondary AML, including post MDS or MPN AML (N=39), and therapy related AML (N=14). 64% of patients had high risk cytogenetics and only 14 normal karyotype. Median WBC was 3.87 G/L and 28 patients had WBC >10 G/L. Median platelets and Hb were 61 G/L and 9.25 g/dL respectively. 41 and 55 patients had marrow blasts < 30% and \u2265 30% respectively, and median circulating blast % was 15% (range, 0-95). The median number of somatic mutations per patient was 2 (range, 0-5). The most frequently mutated genes were TP53 (40%), TET2 (22%) and SRSF2 (19%), then DNMT3A (14%) , ASXL1 (13.5%), IDH2 (11%) and RUNX1 (11%). EVI1 overexpression (defined stringently in this study as DD CT \u2264 8 EVI1/ABL) was found in 12 patients. Overall response rate was 29% (14% CR, 8% PR and 7% Cri), and median response duration was 9.4 months . Median OS was 10.9 months. In univariate analysis, the following factors were significantly associated with shorter OS: platelets and Hb below median (p<0.0001 and p=0.0007 respectively), PS\u22652 (p=0.008), and circulating blasts as continuous variable (p=0.03) while WBC and cytogenetics had no significant impact. OS was significantly worse in patients with TP53 gene mutation (median 8.9 vs 12.3 months in unmutated cases, p=0.01). It tended to be worse for SRSF2 gene mutation (median 8.4 vs 11.5 months, p=0.16) and TET2 gene mutation (median 8.8 vs 11.7 months, p=0.20) and tended to be better in patients with EVI1 overexpression (median 16.1 vs 9.4 months in other patients, p=0.17), while the mutational status of ASXL1 , DNMT3A , IDH2 and RUNX1 genes had no impact on OS. Median survival of patients with at least one mutation of TP53 , TET2 , SRSF2 genes, was 9.1 vs 14.8 months if the 3 mutations were absent (p=0.0008, figure A). In multivariate analysis (logistic regression according to the Wald method), higher PS (p=0.0061), lower Hb (p=0.0014), lower platelets (p=0.0139) higher % circulating blasts (p=0.0145) and presence of TP53 , TET2 or SRSF2 mutation (p=0.0035) were associated with poorer OS. Due to the low number of patients with EVI1 overexpression, this parameter was not included in the multivariate analysis. However, the 7 patients with EVI1 overexpression without any poor prognostic mutation had a median OS of 25.1 months ,versus 8.8 in patients carrying TP53 , TET2 and/or SRSF2 mutations and 12.6 months in remaining patients without EVI overexpression (p=0.022) (figure B).

For TET2 , the effect seemed different from the favorable prognosis observed in MDS treated with AZA (Itzykson, Leukemia, 2011; Sekeres, Blood, 2012). Surprisingly also, EVI1 overexpression, a poor prognostic factor in AML, seemed associated with better outcome with AZA treatment in the absence of any poor prognostic mutation Those findings will require confirmation in larger prospective series.
