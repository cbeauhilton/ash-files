    "abstract_text": "Abstract 854 It has been proposed that most protein-encoding genes may be regulated by small multifunctional RNAs which can control transcript turnover and/or protein translation (siRNA and miRNA). Specifically, miRNAs have been shown to act predominantly at the level of translation by blocking the access or sliding of ribosomes to mRNAs (3'UTR). Several studies have shown that multiple miRNAs can be disregulated in tumours as compared to normal tissues. For example, the miR-17-92 cluster is up regulated in CML, suggesting their involvement in leukemiagenesis (Venturini et al., Blood 2007). However, a role of miRNA in preventing tumor development and progression has also been suggested. Bueno et al have shown that hsa-miR-203 can specifically target BCR-ABL and reduce its expression in CML derived cell lines (Bueno et al., Cancer Cell 2008). Since multiple miRNAs seem to act in a combinatorial fashion to regulate mRNA translation, we hypothesised that other miRNAs in addition to hsa-miR-203 might be involved in BCR-ABL expression control. To test this hypothesis we conducted a search for miRNAs specifically targeting Bcr-Abl, using the miRBASE program to scan human genome ( http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/ ). This search identified 15 miRNAs potentially able to target the BCR-ABL 3' UTR. Further investigation showed that only hsa-miR-451, hsa-miR-515-3p and hsa-miR-760 had a sufficiently high score to predict genuine interactions with the 3'UTR of BCR-ABL and therefore only these miRNAs were utilized for further analyses. Initially, the three miRNAs were transfected in K562 Ph+ cells, together with hsa-miR-203 as a positive control and a scrambled miRNA used as a negative control. BCR-ABL expression was monitored at both mRNA ( qRT-PCR) and protein level (Western Blotting). Our results demonstrated that BCR-ABL mRNA expression was unaffected by miRNAs, whereas protein expression was significantly reduced. Considering the combinatorial function of miRNAs on their target mRNAs, we also tested whether a pool of the four identified miRNAs could be effective in suppressing BCR-ABL expression. In those experiments, the molar concentration of each miRNA was a quarter of that used for a single miRNA transfection. The results have shown that the pool of miRNAs worked efficiently in suppressing Bcr-Abl expression, which suggested a cooperative function of the four miRNAs in controlling both the expression and translation of Bcr-Abl. To further confirm that miRNAs directly targeted BCR-ABL, the 3'UTR of the gene was cloned downstream of a reporter renilla luciferase gene. The reporter was co-transfected in HEK293 cells together with single miRNAs or a pool of them, and luciferase activity was quantified. Those results show that the presence of each miRNAs significantly reduced the luciferase activity as compared to that obtained by transfecting cells with a scrambled miRNA. These experiments therefore confirmed a direct effect of the four miRNAs on the 3'UTR of BCR-ABL. Again the \u201cpool\u201d of miRNAs showed the strongest effect on the luc reporter expression. Through an additional deletion analysis we mapped the regions of 3'UTR of BCR-ABL targeted by the four miRNAs, in order to confirm that the predicted binding regions of miRNAs are critical to mediate repression of BCR-ABL. In conclusion, our study identified three new human miRNAs having a potential to specifically target BCR-ABL and suppress its translation and expression in CML cells. BCR-ABL, which plays a critical role in CML, is effectively suppressed by TK inhibitors, exemplified by Gleevec and our findings provide a rationale to exploit miRNA as an alternative therapeutic approache which could further improve CML treatment, or to complement TK inhibitors in an effort to eradicate minimal residual disease.
