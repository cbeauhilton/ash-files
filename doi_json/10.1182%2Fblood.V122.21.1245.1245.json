    "abstract_text": "Donor-cell derived leukemia (DCL) is a rare but serious complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), reported in 5% of all relapses following allogeneic HSCT. Only 12 cases of DCL after umbilical cord blood (UCB) HSCT are reported in the literature. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for DCL, including occult donor leukemia, impaired immunity, drug toxicity, or a bone marrow \u201cleukemogenic milieu\u201d. We propose a novel mechanism of leukemogenesis, mediated by very short telomeres of donor cells with subsequent severe telomere attrition in vivo, genomic instability, and progression to complex cytogenetics acute myeloid leukemia (AML), based on study of a patient who underwent UCB HSCT for myelodysplasia (MDS). The patient was a 44-year-old woman, subsequently shown to have a T354M mutation in GATA2 , who presented at age 19 years with multiple infections and MDS. At age 41, due to progression of MDS to AML, she received induction chemotherapy and underwent a single 4/6 HLA-matched UCB HSCT. She had delayed engraftment. achieving an absolute neutrophil count of 500/ul more than 100 days post-transplant. Chimerism studies demonstrated 100% donor cell at all time-points post-transplant. Two years and eight months after HSCT she presented with pancytopenia, circulating myeloblasts, and 50% myeloblasts in bone marrow, indicating recurrence of with AML. However, cytogenetics revealed complex abnormalities, t(2p;3q) and an interstitial deletion of 5q, male cells, indicating donor origin of AML. Telomere length of the transplanted cord blood cells measured by Q-PCR showed a severe decrease in length to 7.7 kb compared with an average length of 13 kb in control UCB (n=12). Moreover the telomere length decreased precipitously to 6.6 kb 2 years after transplantation and 5.6 kb at the time of diagnosis of AML. Single telomere length assay (STELA) was used to assess chromosome-specific telomere length. Very short telomeres (<3.0 kb) were present in the UCB before transplant that increased in proportion post-transplant before progression to AML. In contrast, very short telomeres were not present in control UCB STELA. Sequencing of cord blood-derived myeloid cells showed no mutation in TERT or TERC. Comparative genomic hybridization confirmed the complex cytogenetics. Telomere attrition occurs in the first year after HSCT, presumably due to proliferative stress on the stem cell compartment. In comparison to bone marrow, UCB have longer telomeres, but HSC number may be lower than in a BM inoculum, especially for adult recipients. In our case, initial telomere length of UCB was extremely short, for unclear reasons but possibly related to low cord blood cell viability. The long time that was needed for engraftment generated additional telomere attrition with accumulation of very short telomere and genomic instability leading to development of leukemia. Screening UCB for telomere length prior to HSCT might prove useful in identifying situations at risk for graft failure or malignant transformation.
