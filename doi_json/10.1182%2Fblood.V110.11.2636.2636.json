    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable hematological malignancy characterized by recurrent chromosomal translocations. The t(4;14)(p16;q32) is associated with the worst prognosis of any patient subgroup in MM, although the basis for this poor prognosis is unknown. The t(4;14) is unusual in that it involves two potential target genes on chromosome 4: fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and multiple myeloma SET domain (MMSET). MMSET is universally over-expressed in t(4;14) MM, whereas FGFR3 expression is lost in one third of cases, suggesting a role for MMSET in myeloma pathogenesis. Nonetheless, the role of MMSET in t(4;14) MM has remained unclear. Here we demonstrate a role for MMSET in t(4;14) MM cells. Using homologous recombination-mediated gene targeting, we disrupted the N-terminal and full-length isoforms of MMSET in t(4;14)+ KMS-11 MM cells. Disruption of the translocated MMSET allele revealed that this allele accounts for most of the MMSET transcription in t(4;14) MM cells. Accordingly, selective targeting of the translocated allele, but not the non-translocated allele, led to reduced colony formation in methylcellulose and reduced tumor formation in nude mouse xenografts. Down-regulation of MMSET expression in t(4;14) MM cell lines by stable RNA interference (RNAi) led to a slower growth in liquid culture, a significant reduction in colony formation in methylcellulose, and decreased tumorigenicity in vivo. Additionally, MMSET knockdown led to partial cell cycle arrest of adherent MM cells and reduced the ability of MM cells to adhere to extracellular matrix. Cells with targeted disruption or knockdown of MMSET exhibited changes in expression levels of potential target genes, including several adhesion molecules. These results provide the first direct evidence that translocation-mediated overexpression of MMSET plays a critical role in t(4;14) MM and suggest that therapies targeting this gene could impact this particular subset of poor-prognosis patients.",
