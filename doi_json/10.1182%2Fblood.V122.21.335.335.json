    "abstract_text": "Background Association of acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS) with various cardiovascular (CV) disorders such as cardiac valve disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is well known and documented. The mechanism is thought to be related to shear stress induced loss of high molecular weight multimers (HMWM). The gold standard test to assess for loss of HMWM is von Willebrand protein electrophoresis and then visual assessment of loss of high molecular weight bands. This is both a costly and subjective test. Ratio of von Willebrand factor activity to antigen level is useful in patients with type IIA Von Willebrand Disease caused by loss of HMW multimer, but its sensitivity to detect CV-associated AVWS is unknown. Aim Our aim was to test whether routine VWF laboratory tests could be used to predict which patients with CV conditions are going to have high molecular weight multimer loss. We also aimed to assess whether these tests could be used to predict bleeding risk in patients with CV disorders. Methods We prospectively collected laboratory data of 234 patients with cardiovascular disorders known to be associated with AVWS: aortic stenosis (66), aortic insufficiency(22), aortic and mitral valve prostheses(38), mitral valve regurgitation (51) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy(57). All patients had Von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag), Von Willebrand factor activity by latex method (VWF:Ltx), platelet function testing via PFA-100 CADP as well as von Willebrand factor multimers tested. All patients also completed a bleeding questionnaire. We used logistic regression model to calculate the relationship between the VWF:Ltx/VWF:Ag ratio and loss of high molecular weight multimers. Same analysis was performed for PFA-100. We also tested these associations for bleeding risk. Results Mean value for VWF:Ag was 142 IU/dL, VWF:Ltx 121%, PFA-100 151 seconds and 0.86 for the VWF:Ltx/Ag ratio. Over a half of patients (56%) had VWF multimer loss noted on protein electrophoresis testing and a quarter reported bleeding on bleeding questionnaire. The ratio of VWF:Ltx to VWF:Ag had strong correlation with HMW multimer loss (p<0.001) with AUC of 0.77. Correlation with PFA-100 was even stronger with AUC of 0.83. The ratio cut off value of 0.83 had sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 83% in predicting multimer loss. With the cut off of 0.77, specificity reached 95%. With PFA 100 value of 118 seconds, specificity was 76% and sensitivity was 80%. Increasing the cut off to 198 seconds improved the specificity to 95%. The association with bleeding was present for PFA-100 (p=0.01), but did not exist for the Ltx/Ag ratio. Conclusions PFA-100 CADP as well as VWF:Ag and VWF:Ltx can be used to detect acquired Von Willebrand disease in patients with cardiovascular disorders and may decrease the need for costly and time consuming testing of multimers. PFA-100 CADP also correlates with the bleeding risk in these patients. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
