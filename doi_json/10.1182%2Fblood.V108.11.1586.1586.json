    "abstract_text": "Despite years of investigation in a variety of experimental systems, the mechanisms underlying human \u03b2-globin locus developmental gene switching remain elusive. Several lines of evidence implicate DNA methylation in this process. As an initial step in studying the role of epigenetic modifications in the human switching process and in determining the mechanisms by which DNA methyltransferase inhibitors reverse the switch, we have characterized the DNA methylation patterns of the individual CpGs in the \u03b3- and \u03b2-globin promoters in fetal liver (FL) and adult bone marrow (BM) primary erythroid cells and during in vitro differentiation of adult erythroid cells. Using the bisulfite conversion method we evaluated all CpGs in the ~500 bp regions centered on the \u03b3- and \u03b2-globin promoter start sites. Fetal liver (FL) and adult bone marrow (BM) samples were obtained using IRB approved protocols and informed consent procedures. Erythroid cells were purified using anti-glycophorin A (glyA) magnetic beads. Purity was confirmed to be greater than 95%. Samples from five independent BM and FL samples were analyzed and 8\u201320 bisulfite converted sequences were determined for each promoter in each sample. Our results show that all 8 CpGs between \u2212249 and +210 of the G\u03b3 and A\u03b3-globin promoters are less than 20% methylated in FL and greater than 80% methylated in BM except for the \u2212158 CpG which is only 40% methylated in BM(p<0.002). The 6 CpGs between \u2212415 and +110 of the \u03b2-globin promoter show an inverse pattern with lower levels of DNA methylation in BM. Histone H3 acetylation of the \u03b3-globin promoter, as determined by ChIP analysis, showed a complimentary pattern with higher levels in FL than BM. We next evaluated \u03b3-globin promoter methylation patterns during in vitro erythroid differentiation from CD34+ BM cells. In this experiment, cells were grown with SCF, Flt3 ligand and IL-3 for 7 days and then in EPO for 14 days producing erythroid cells which express 99%HbA and 1% HbF. The initial day 0 CD34+ cells showed 90\u2013100% methylation of all \u03b3 promoter sites. By day 3 in culture, before the initiation of erythroid differentiation, methylation at all sites upstream of the promoter had decreased to less than 60% and the CpG at \u221253 (the site of Stage Selector Protein complex binding) had decreased to less than 20%. The three CpG sites down-stream of the promoter (+6, +17 and +50) remained highly methylated. The pattern was unchanged at day 10, early in erythroid differentiation, when \u03b3-globin mRNA expression was beginning. By day 14, when \u03b2-globin expression was peaking, methylation of the upstream promoter had increased back to the 70\u2013100% level at all CpGs. These experiments provide a comprehensive picture of \u03b3- and \u03b2-globin promoter methylation during the fetal and adult stages of erythroid development and of the \u03b3-globin promoter during adult erythroid differentiation. The finding of transient \u03b3-promoter hypomethylation during differentiation offers a potential mechanism to explain the transient \u03b3-globin gene expression seen during normal adult erythropoiesis. Our results also raise the possibility that, just as domains of altered histone modification exist in \u03b2-globin gene loci, there may also be developmentally-specific domains of DNA methylation."
