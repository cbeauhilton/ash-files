    "abstract_text": "Introduction In January 2013 was received in our lab service a bone marrow sample for cytogenetic analysis. The 61 years old female patient presents an elevated white blood cell count (118,000 x10\u00b3/mm\u00b3) and clinical diagnosis as Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). According the medical information the treatment began with hydroxyurea 3g daily and allopurinol 300mg daily. Methods We proceeded with cytogenetic examination of the patient\u2019s bone marrow aspirate by conventional G-banding analysis performed on unstimulated short-term cultures (24 hrs). FISH for BCR/ABL translocation was tested using a dual fusion dual color probe. Because of the sample stability we were unable to performed RT-PCR test. Results Chromosome analysis showed the translocation (9;22)(p24;q11.2) as a sole abnormality in 100% (20/20) of analyzed metaphases. Chronic myeloid leukemia presents as a specific chromosomal abnormality the Philadelphia chromosome, t(9;22)(q34;q11) which is different from the results obtained where the region of translocation of chromosome 9 was p24 instead of the classic q34. This result suggests it is BCR/JACK2 translocation. The FISH analysis showed the presence of a complex Ph chromosome: ABL con BCRx1 (one fusion) and BCRx2;ABLx2. Conclusion The patient took imatinib without answer. She is still in clinical monitoring with persistent hyperleucocytosis and the treatment is following with hydroxyurea 500mg daily and Interferon 5000 UI three times a week. Further molecular and cytogenetic tests will be performed in a second sample to contribute with evaluation of disease progression and monitoring treatment response.
