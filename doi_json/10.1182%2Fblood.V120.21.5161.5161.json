    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5161 Objectives: To better assess the efficacy and safety of monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab in the treatment of refractory and recurrent autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Patients and methods: 7 cases with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (including 1 case of Evans syndrome) were enrolled into this study, they were treated with rituximab (375 mg/m 2 , once per week, 2\u20136 times) and Cyclophosphamide(1g/10days, 2\u20136 times) combined with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (10g/week, given 1 day after rituximab treatment). Results: All 7 patients showed good responses. 6 achieved complete remission (CR) and 1 achieved partial remission (PR). Responses were seen at 1th to 10th month after the first dose of rituximab and the mean response time was approximately 2. 5 months. Average follow-up time for them isfor the patients was 27 months. All patients remained in remission at the 12-month follow-up. At the time of 24-month follow up, 3 patients showed elevated indirect bilirubin and increased reticulocyte counts. One of the 3 patients achieved CR after additional rituximab therapy, and the other 2 PR after additional cyclophosphamide therapy. At the time of 36-month follow up, 1 patient relapsed and was retreated with 3 cycles of rituximab and eventually reached PR. All patients tolerated the treatment well with only mild side effects. Conclusion: rituximab is highly effective and relatively safe in patients with refractory and recurrent autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Maybe Additional treatment can be given in patients with relapse after 1\u20132 years. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
