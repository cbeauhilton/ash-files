    "abstract_text": "Routine evaluation prior to stem cell transplantation generally includes assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), pulmonary function, renal function, liver function, and functional status. Patients in whom compromised organ function is detected, are often deemed ineligible for myeloablative transplantation. However, the predictive value of specific pretransplant tests is not well documented, and has not been critically analyzed in patients receiving busulfan-based preparative regimens. We analyzed the prognostic value of the pretransplant evaluation performed in 1035 consecutive patients who underwent autologous (n=444) or allogeneic (n=591) transplantation with busulfan-based regimens between 2/84 and 12/03 for acute (250) or chronic leukemia (198), myelodysplasia (50), multiple myeloma (88), or Hodgkin\u2019s (139) or non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (303). Ages ranged from 4\u201375 (median 41). BuCy was given to 477 and BuCyVP16 to 558 individuals. Ninety three patients had EF < 50%, 61 had DLCO < 65%, 103 had elevated creatine, 130 had elevated tranaminases or bilirubin, and 116 had Karnofsky scores < 80%. For the entire group, multivariable analysis demonstrated only Karnofsky score < 80% (P < .001) and elevated LFTs (P=.04) to have significant adverse prognostic influence on survival. Karnofsky score was significant in patients undergoing autologous (P .2), nor for the autologous or allogeneic transplant groups. However in patients undergoing transplants from unrelated donors (n=119) DLCO < 65% was a significant adverse prognostic factor (P=.004). There was no association of compromised cardiac or pulmonary function with cardiac or pulmonary failure as a primary cause of death. This study suggests that moderately compromised organ function, particularly cardiopulmonary limitations which might not be clinically apparent, are of limited value in prediction of transplant outcome. Direct clinical assessment, including functional status are of much greater value in prediction of outcome. It is hoped that this investigation will stimulate larger studies of pretransplant predictors of outcome with attention to their relevance to specific preparative regimens, sources of stem cells, and other treatment variables.",
