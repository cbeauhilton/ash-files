    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Customized gene panel sequencing is an attractive approach to genomic tumor characterization in clinical care. Based on published MM exome data we developed a MM Mutation Panel (M 3 P) that includes the most commonly mutated genes, actionable drug targets, genes targeted by current standard of care (SOC) therapies and which allows tracking of clonal evolution, copy number and sample purity. Methods and Material: M 3 P (v3.0) covers 88 genes (1327 amplicons, 181kb). MM samples from 504 patients (pts) have been analyzed (corresponding germline in 81%) through collaborations between Mayo Clinic and Hospital-12-de-Octubre (Madrid, Spain), the DSMM and GMMG (W\u00fcrzburg, Ulm, Freiburg and Heidelberg, Germany) and the HOVON trial groups (Rotterdam, The Netherlands). The investigated cohort includes 410 untreated pts (81%), which includes a high risk cohort of 72 pts with del17p, 25 paired samples with later follow up from the same cohort, and 94 relapsed patients, of which 50 were relapsed and refractory. Results: Overall coverage per mutation averaged >500x depth. We identified 945 variants (1.9 per pt) and in 83% of the pts a mutation was found. Clonal heterogeneity was assessed with mutations ranging from 3%-100% variant reads suggesting the presence of a significant number of subclones (e.g. 21% of mutations were in < 10% of reads). The mutation incidence was compared with and closely resembles the most recent MM comprehensive genomic data from the MMRF CoMMpass study: We compare here all pts sequenced by M 3 P, untreated pts sequenced by M 3 P and CoMMpass: KRAS (24%/23%/24%), NRAS (20%/20%/18%), DIS3 (13%/14%/10%), BRAF (9%/7%/6%), FAM46C (6%/6%/8%) and TRAF3 (6%/6%/7%). TP53 mutation incidence, however, was significantly increased in our cohort (14%/12%/4.2%), a difference explained by the inclusion of del17p (untreated) and relapsed refractory MM in panel sequenced pts, cohorts with elevated incidences of TP53 mutations (32% / 26% respectively). Potentially actionable targets include BRAF mutationsin 43 patients (9%), with druggable p.V600E in 19 or 5%, 8 pts (2%) with FGFR3 (p.R248C and p.G375C one patient each), p.R132 mutation in 4 out of 5 IDH1 (1%) and p.R172K IDH2 mutation in 1 of 3 (1%) pts. Mutations in the MAPK pathway ( NRAS, KRAS, BRAF ) were detected in 59% of pts, ranging from 36% untreated MM to 72% in refractory MM. Similarly, the CRBN/CUL4B/IKZF1/IKZF3/IRF4 pathway, important for IMiD function, harbored a significant enrichment of mutations in advanced disease (6% untreated vs 17% relapsed), including CRBN mutations (0.5% vs 7%). Nine of 17 IRF4 mutations were located at the p.K123R hotspot, with minor difference between early or late disease (1% vs 3%). Notably, in 8 of 9 pts with CRBN mutation and clinical information, all were unresponsive to IMiD therapy, supporting association of these mutations with resistance to IMiDs. Conversely, M 3 P genes related to other SOC therapies, including NR3C1 (targeted by steroids) and 5 proteasome subunit genes (proteasome inhibitors), were rarely mutated across the cohorts not exceeding 1% mutation incidence for each gene. Significant differences in DIS3 and FAM46C mutation incidences were observed across cohorts: DIS3 mutations are more common in untreated pts with a 1.7 fold increased predominance (14% untreated and 8% treated). FAM46C has an expected incidence of 8% but was rarely mutated in untreated del17p high risk disease with only one of 100 patients harboring both mutations. The significance of this finding needs to be determined but implies a possible overlap in function. Finally we assessed impact on survival of the mutation variants identified in 142 untreated Mayo patients and found STAT3 mutations negatively impacting PFS (p=0.034) and OS (p=0.001). This gene is rarely mutated in MM (2% of the total cohort) thus the sample size was small and this finding needs further validation. Conclusion: We here describe 504 MM patients sequenced using the M 3 P gene panel, which identified mutations in >80% of investigated patients, overlaps well with published whole exome sequence data and provides clinically relevant information. New findings were the high frequency of minor clones, the relative lack of overlap of del17 and FAM46C mutation, a higher frequency of DIS3 mutation at diagnosis compared to relapse, the prognostic significance of STAT3 mutation and the frequent presence of CRBN pathway mutation in drug resistant relapsed patients.
