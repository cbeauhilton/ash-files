    "abstract_text": "Analysis of patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) may shed light on the delicate balance of factors controlling differentiation, maintenance, and decay of neutrophil granulocytes. Mutations in ELANE, GFI1, HAX1, G6PC3, WAS , and VPS45 are known to cause SCN. We here describe a new monogenetic SCN variant with biallelic mutations in the gene encoding Jagunal homolog 1 (JAGN1). We studied an index family from Northern Africa with a total of 5 children suffering from SCN. An Affymetrix SNP array-based genetic linkage analysis was performed and identified a single interval of perfect segregation with highly significant multi-marker LOD scores of at least 4.5spanning approximately 1.5Mbp from 9.52Mb to 11.04Mb on chromosome 3 of NCBI\u2019s human genome build 36.3. This interval contained a total of 30 genes, including JAGN1 which encodes an ER-resident protein. Sanger sequencing revealed a homozygous mutation c.3G>A in exon 1 of the JAGN1 gene; this mutation leads to disruption of the defined start of translation. Systematic analysis of a cohort of 90 SCN patients identified 9 distinct homozygous mutations in the gene encoding Jagunal homolog 1 (JAGN1) in 14 SCN patients, thus accounting for approximately 10% of SCN patients. The clinical phenotype was variable and included failure to thrive, developmental delay and bone skeletal abnormalities. The only consistent finding in all JAGN1-deficient patients was SCN and partial or complete refractoriness to therapy with rh-GCSF. JAGN1 is the human ortholog of a gene originally identified in Drosophila melanogaster. Jagunal-deficient oocytes are characterized by defective ER reorganization and aberrant membrane trafficking during vitellogenesis. We found that JAGN1 -mutant human granulocytes showed aberrantly enlarged ER structures and paucity of secretory vesicles. We hypothesized that that ER aberrations may be associated with defective N-glycosylation of multiple proteins in neutrophil granulocytes and found that JAGN1 -mutant neutrophil granulocytes exhibited anomalous N-glycomic profiles characterized by a marked reduction in fucosylation of all their multi-antennary glycans. JAGN1-deficient neutrophil granulocytes showed increased apoptosis in response to TNFa and staurosporine, likely accounting for the lack of mature neutrophils in these patients. Additional studies in JAGN1 -knockdown cells indicate that JAGN1 participates in the secretory pathway and is required for granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor-mediated signaling. Global proteomic analysis of the JAGN1-interactome identified a limited number of interaction partners including members of the Coat Protein I (COPI) complex (COPA, COPB2, and COPG2) which suggest a role for JAGN1 in vesicular trafficking from Golgi to ER. Taken together, JAGN1 emerges as a hitherto unrecognized factor necessary in differentiation and survival of neutrophil granulocytes and a novel gene implicated in SCN.
