    "abstract_text": "Background: The occurrence of an activating JAK2 mutation (JAK2 V617F) has been reported in a variable proportion of patients with bcr/abl -negative myeloproliferative disorders including myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM). In the current study, we report mutational frequencies in each of the 3 MMM variants as well as examine the prognostic relevance of the mutation in a large group of patients from a single institution. Methods: Mutation analysis for JAK2 V617F was performed in DNA derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from all study patients (n=157). Concomitant analysis was also performed in DNA derived from purified granulocytes (n=57), CD34-positive cells (n=25), and T cells (n=19). Genomic DNA was amplified by PCR and fluorescent dye chemistry sequencing was performed using the same primers used for amplification. Results: The study cohort included 157 consecutive patients with MMM including 117 with agnogenic (AMM), 22 with post polycythemic (PPMM), and 18 with post thrombocythemic (PTMM) myeloid metaplasia. The overall detection rate for JAK2 V617F in PBMC was 51% (homozygous in 5.7%) and was significantly (p=0.0002) higher in PPMM (91%; homozygous in 18%) compared to either AMM (45.3%; homozygous in 2.6%) or PTMM (38.9%; homozygous in 11.1%). In AMM (n=117), the presence of JAK2 V617F was significantly associated with an older age at diagnosis (p=0.03), and a history of both thrombosis (p=0.01) and pruritus (p=0.005). No other statistical associations were evident and the presence of the mutation did not predict leukemic transformation. Furthermore, multivariate analysis for overall survival of patients with AMM identified only age and the Dupriez prognostic score as independent prognostic factors; JAK2 V617F had no prognostic significance. Finally, the mutation was not found in T cells and its detection rate in either granulocytes or CD34-positive cells was similar to that in PBMC. Conclusion: JAK2 V617F is a myeloid lineage-specific event, its incidence in MMM is significantly higher with an antecedent history of polycythemia vera, and its presence in AMM does not affect prognosis but is associated with PV-characteristic clinical features.",
