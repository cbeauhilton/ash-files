    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4687 JAK2 mutation is commonly found in Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). In Western countries, this mutation is found in approximately 96 percent of people with polycythemia vera, half of individuals with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis. We used the method of amplification refractory mutation PCR (ARMS-PCR) to investigate MPN patients in China. We focused our study on patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). ARMS-PCR was used to detect JAK2 V617F mutation in the bone barrow (BM) or peripheral blood of 37 MPN patients, which consisting of 7 ET, 5 polycythemia vera (PV), 5 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 5 chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF), as well as 15 suspected MPNs. 17 cases of JAK2 V617F mutation (45.9%) were found in 37 patients, including 4 ET (57.1%), 4 PV (80.0%), 3 CIMF (60.0%), 6 suspected MPNs (40.0%). We did not find JAK2 V617F in the patients with CML. Our results indicated that the frequency of JAK2 V617F mutation in bcr/abl-negative MPNs in Chinese is similar to that in MPN patients in Western countries. At the same time, ARMS-PCR can distinguish the mutation is heterozygous or homozygous. Most patients were heterozygous for JAK2 but only a few were homozygous. In conclusion, our study showed that JAK2 V617F mutation frequency in Chinese MPN patients is similar to that in patients with this disorder in the West. It is the major molecular genetic abnormality in bcr-abl negative MPN and it can be used for diagnosis of MPN in China. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
