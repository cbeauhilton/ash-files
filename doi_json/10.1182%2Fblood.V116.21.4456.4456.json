    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4456 Background. The plant-derived agent \u03b1-bisabolol is a small oily sesquiterpene alcohol that has been demonstrated to be cytotoxic against human malignant non-hematological and leukemic cells (Bonifacio M et al, Blood, 2009 ASH annual meeting abstracts ;114:4800). Here we tested its activity against BCR-ABL + cell lines and primary cells from patients, alone or in combination with the Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) Imatinib and Nilotinib. Also, the mechanism of \u03b1-bisabolol cytotoxicity in BCR-ABL + cells was assessed. Methods. We used the BCR-ABL + K562, LAMA-84 and CML-T1 cell lines and primary leukemic cells from 14 patients with BCR-ABL + Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia at diagnosis. First, the citotoxicity of single-agent \u03b1-bisabolol was determined by MTT. Then, mitochondrial membrane potential of treated cells was evaluated by the JC-1 dye in flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Permeabilized leukemic cells were assayed for oxygen consumption by measuring mitochondrial state 3 and uncoupled respiration. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in \u03b1-bisabolol treated cells were quantified in flow cytometry by oxidation of CM-H 2 DCFDA, measuring the fluorescence intensity of the DCF products. Apoptosis was studied by the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and internucleosomal DNA laddering analysis. Finally, the combination effects between \u03b1-bisabolol and Imatinib or Nilotinib (kindly provided by Novartis) were analyzed according to the median-effect method of Chou and Talalay using the CalcuSyn software. Results. \u03b1-bisabolol reduced the viability of BCR-ABL + cells in a dose-dependent manner. The mean IC 50 values of \u03b1-bisabolol were 46\u00b111 \u03bc M for primary leukemic cells and ranged from 62 to 115 \u03bc M in the cell lines. JC-1 staining of BCR-ABL + primary leukemic cells treated with 40 \u03bc M \u03b1-bisabolol for 3 to 5 hours demonstrated a dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (\u0394\u03a8 m ), thus indicating the start of the apoptotic process. Moreover, NADH-supported state 3 respiration in \u03b1-bisabolol treated leukemic cells was significantly decreased in comparison with untreated leukemic controls (140.0\u00b170.5 vs 280.7\u00b111.9 pmol O 2 /min/10 6 cells; p<.05). Finally, PARP cleavage and DNA laddering followed \u03b1-bisabolol exposure of leukemic BCR-ABL + blasts. The apoptosis induction was accompanied by ROS production. When tested in combination at constant ratio with Imatinib or Nilotinib, \u03b1-bisabolol showed overall slight to strong synergistic effects, without evidence for antagonism across a range of doses ( Table 1 ). In 3 patients with mutation of BCR-ABL (T315I, E255V and Y253H, respectively) we observed full activity of \u03b1-bisabolol as single agent and confirmed the synergism between \u03b1-bisabolol and Imatinib.

This study indicates that \u03b1-bisabolol is an effective pro-apoptotic agent for human acute BCR-ABL + leukemia cells via induction of mitochondrial membrane damage. The combination of \u03b1-bisabolol with Imatinib or Nilotinib allows a dose reduction up to 90% of each drug to obtain the same cytotoxic effect, so indicating a clear synergism. \u03b1-bisabolol may be a potential candidate for the treatment of BCR-ABL + leukemias and the effective dose of TKIs could be reduced in a combined treatment with \u03b1-bisabolol.
