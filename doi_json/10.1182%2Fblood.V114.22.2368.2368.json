    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2368 Poster Board II-345 Background: B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the progressive accumulation of CD5 + B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, lymphoid organs and bone marrow. Despite aggressive therapy, CLL is still incurable partly because of intrinsic defect in apoptosis induction. A novel therapeutic agent, Bosutinib, was initially developed as an inhibitor of Src and Abl kinases and is currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of several human malignancies. Recently, Bosutinib has been shown to inhibit phosphorylation of a novel receptor tyrosine kinase, Axl which has been reported to be overexpressed in several types of human cancers including colon, prostatic, thyroid, breast, gastric, renal and lung. Previously, Dasatinib, another Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, showed cytotoxic effects on CLL B cells by decreasing levels of activated, phosphorylated forms of Akt, Erk1/2 and p38 and reducing expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL in CLL B cells. Here, we wished to examine receptor or non-receptor tyrosine kinases active in primary CLL B-cells and determine their status after exposure to Bosutinib as well as the latter drug's effect on CLL B-cell viability. Methods: We used freshly isolated CLL B cells after obtaining written consent from patients. Bosutinib was used at various doses (2.5, 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0 \u03bcM) to treat CLL B cells in vitro for 24/48 hrs. Induction of apoptosis was assessed by annexin/propidium staining. To examine the impact of stroma on Bosutinib induced CLL B-cell death, primary CLL-bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) were cocultured with CLL B cells at a cell density ratio of 1:20 and treated with various doses of Bosutinib for 24 hrs. Expression status of various kinases and downstream targets were analyzed in CLL B cell lysates with or without Bosutinib-treatment by Western blot using specific antibodies. Results: Treatment of CLL B-cells with Bosutinib induces a massive apoptotic cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner (IC 50 for 24 h; \u223c10 \u03bcM and IC 50 for 48 h: 5-10 \u03bcM) which involves PARP cleavage as demonstrated by Western blot analysis. Moreover, Bosutinib-treatment reduced expression of several key anti-apoptotic proteins, Mcl-1, XIAP and Bcl-2 reported to be overexpressed in CLL B cells. Interestingly, we detected that the majority of CLL B-cells express constitutively active Axl. Importantly, Bosutinib treatment inhibited phosphorylation of Axl in CLL B cells resulting in inhibition of AKT-activation, one of its downstream signaling pathways. Previous studies have suggested a possible physical association between Axl and Src kinase. We observed that expression of constitutively active Axl was associated with the presence of highly phosphorylated Src kinase when compared with that in CLL B-cells with low or unphosphorylated Axl. These observations suggest that phosphorylation of Axl may be an upstream event for Src activation in CLL. We found inhibition of constitutively active Axl resulted in subsequent inhibition of Src kinase activation in CLL B-cells following Bosutinib-treatment. We also detected inhibition of ZAP70/Syk-phosphorylation in CLL B cells upon Bosutinib-treatment. Finally, we found Bosutinib was able to overcome stomal protection of CLL B cells at a dose of 10 \u03bcM in an in vitro coculture system suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent against CLL. Conclusion: Together, these observations suggest that Bosutinib induces apoptosis in CLL B-cells, even in the presence of stromal cells, in association with the down regulation of multiple kinases including the novel receptor-tyrosine kinase, Axl, and reduces expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins critical to CLL B-cell survival. In total, these findings for the first time indicate that Bosutinib has the potential to be a very potent therapeutic agent for CLL patients.
