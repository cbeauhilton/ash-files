    "abstract_text": "T cells can be genetically modified to target tumor antigens through the expression of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). CAR T cells targeting the CD19 antigen is a novel therapeutic approach for patients with relapsed B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). We have previously demonstrated that CAR T cells have a significant clinical benefit in adult patients with relapsed B-ALL. The primary objective of this study (NCT01860937) is to extend the use and test the safety of CD19 specific CAR T cells in children with relapsed CD19 + B-ALL. To date, 11 pediatric patients with very high risk (VHR) or relapsed B-ALL have been enrolled on protocol with a median age of 13 years (range 2-23 years) at time of T cell collection. We have treated 4 pediatric patients with relapsed B-ALL (ages 13, 14, 19, and 22 years) using patient derived T cells expressing a CD19 specific CAR (19-28z). Complete response (complete remission or complete remission with incomplete count recovery) occurred in 2/4 (50%) patients. Severe cytokine release syndrome (sCRS) defined by fever for \u22653 consecutive days, elevated serum cytokine levels, and one clinical sign of toxicity (hypotension, hypoxia, neurologic disorder including altered mental status, obtundation, and/or seizure) occurred in both patients who responded to CAR T cells. Morphologic disease (\u22655% bone marrow blasts) at time of treatment was present in three patients including both patients with sCRS. Systemic immunosuppressants (corticosteroids or anti-IL6 receptor antibody tocilizumab) abrogated clinical symptoms of sCRS. Elevated serum cytokines of IFN-g (>20 fold), fractalkine (>20 fold), Flt-3L (>55 fold), IL-5 (>15 fold), IL-6 (>100 fold), and IL-10 (>15 fold) were demonstrated in patients with sCRS. Monitoring of bone marrow demonstrated peak 19-28z CAR T-cell detection within 1-2 weeks following infusion with gradual contracture over 2-3 months. These early results demonstrate the feasibility and significant clinical impact of this approach in patients with relapsed B-ALL. To more rapidly generate statistically relevant data, demonstrate the \u201cexportability\u201d of this technology between academic institutions, and offer this therapeutic option to a broader number of pediatric patients with chemo-refractory B-ALL our trial will expand into a phase I multicenter clinical trial with a collaborating institution. Subsequent cohorts of patients will receive 19-28z CAR T cells and will be evaluated for toxicity, persistence of CAR T cells, and for anti-leukemic efficacy.
