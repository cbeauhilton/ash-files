    "abstract_text": "Background: Lenalidomide combined with low-dose dexamethasone (Len-dex) is an effective treatment for the patients with refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma (RRMM). The anti-myeloma effect of lenalidomide is associated with activation of the immune system, but the exact immunomodulatory mechanisms in vivo and clinical impact of Len/dex in RRMM patients remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed immune cell populations in patients receiving Len-dex for the treatment of RRMM. Methods: Peripheral blood samples from 90 RRMM patients were taken on day 1 of cycles 1 (baseline), 2, 3, and 4 of Len/dex therapy. CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + , CD161 + T cells, natural killer (NK) cell (CD16 + /CD56 + ), NKT-like cell (CD3 + /CD56 + ) and myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) including granulocytic (G-MDSC) and monocytic (M-MDSC) were analyzed by flow cytometry. In addition, response was assessed in 81 patients receiving more than 4 cycles of Len-dex and the comparison of cell populations according to an achievement of \u2265very good partial response (VGPR) was performed. Results: Forty-eight men and 42 women were enrolled in this study. The median age was 61 years (range, 29-84 years). At baseline, peripheral blood CD3 + cell frequency was 51.65 \u00b1 1.79% which was significantly decreased to 41.67 \u00b1 2.44% (P=0.001) and 39.72 \u00b1 2.90% (P< 0.001) after 2 and 3 cycles of therapy, respectively. Frequency of both CD4 + cell and CD8 + cells was also significantly decreased by 3 cycles of therapy, while NK cell frequency was significantly increased after Len-dex treatment (P<0.05). For the T-cell subset, the frequency of CD8 + CD161 high cells was significantly decreased (1.13 \u00b1 0.16% at baseline to 0.65 \u00b1 0.13% at post-3 cycles, P< 0.05), while no trend was observed in CD4 + CD161 + cell frequency. No significant change was observed in frequency of G-MDSC and M-MDSC after Len-dex. Among 81 evaluable patients, 36 patients obtained \u2265VGPR and 45 \u2264 partial response. After adjusting for factors affecting failure of achieving a response of \u2265VGPR on univariate analyses, multivariate analyses showed that decrease in CD8 + cell frequency (P=0.043) and increase in M-MDSC frequency (P=0.033) by post-3 cycles of Len-dex treatment were predictors for failure of achieving \u2265VGPR. High frequency of NKT-like cell prior to Len-dex treatment could predict a longer time to progression (RR of 0.40, P=0.011). In addition, patients with less decrease in frequency of both CD3 + cell and CD8 + cells by post-3 cycles had a longer time to next treatment (RR of 0.24, P=0.024 and RR of 0.33, P=0.044, respectively). Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that Len-dex therapy in patients with RRMM is associated with decreased frequency of T cells with a trend of increased NK cell frequency. Change in CD8 + cell and M-MDSC frequency can correlate with the quality of response to Len-dex. Baseline NKT-like cell frequency and change in CD3 + and CD8 + cells early after treatment may predict continuation of anti-myeloma effect of Len-dex therapy.
