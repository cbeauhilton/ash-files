    "abstract_text": "Immune mechanism is considered to exert in the pathogenesis of marrow failure in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), idiopathic aplastic anemia (AA) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS); however, the molecular events are unknown. We have currently reported the appearance of NKG2D ligands such as cytomegalovirus glycoprotein UL16 binding proteins (ULBPs) and MHC class I-related chains A and B (MICA/B) on granulocytes and CD34 + marrow cells of some patients with PNH and its related diseases ( Hanaoka N, et al. Blood . 2006 ; 107 : 1184 \u20131191 ). ULBP and MICA/B are stress-inducible membrane proteins that appear in infection and transformation. The ligands share NKG2D receptor on lymphocytes such as NK, CD8 + T, and \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells and promote activation of the lymphocytes. Cells expressing the ligands are then deadly injured by NKG2D + lymphocytes (Groh, PNAS 1996; Cosman, Immunity 2001). Indeed, cells expressing NKG2D ligands were killed in vitro by autologous NKG2D + lymphocytes of our patients ( Hanaoka N, et al. Blood . 2005 ; 106 : 304a ; Blood . 2006 ; 108 : 295a ). In further analysis, ligands were detected on granulocytes in 47 (53%) of 88 patients: 11 (58%) of 19 PNH, 28 (60%) of 47 AA, and 8 (36%) of 22 refractory anemia. Ligands were also detected on immature bone marrow cells in all 11 patients (3 PNH, 5 AA, and 3 refractory anemia) who permitted analysis of their marrow cells. In the patients, it is conceivable that blood cells were exposed to a certain stress to induce NKG2D ligands, leading to NKG2D-mediated marrow injury. We also observed a close association of the ligand expression with pancytopenia and favorable response to immunosuppressive therapy by prospective analysis of 5 patients (3 AA-PNH syndrome and 2 AA) for more than one year up to 5 years. Thus, we here propose that NKG2D-mediated immunity, which drives both NK and T-cells, is critically implicated in the pathogenesis of bone marrow failure of PNH and its related disorders."
