    "abstract_text": "The BCR-ABL fusion oncogene which encodes a fused deregulated tyrosine kinase causes chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in humans. Imatinib, a small molecule ABL kinase inhibitor has been highly effective in treating chronic phase (CP) CML patients. However, a substantial number of patients undergo relapse due to development of resistance to imatinib therapy that leads to blast crisis (BC-CML), which is invariably fatal within weeks to months. Additional genetic aberrations assist in progression and identification of key players that are responsible for transformation is of utmost importance from a therapeutic point of view. Growth arrest DNA damage 45a (Gadd45a) gene, a member in the gadd45 family of genes including Gadd45b & Gadd45g, was identified as a myeloid differentiation primary response gene. There is evidence consistent with it\u2019s involvement in G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to multiple stressors, including genotoxic and oncogenic stress. To investigate the effect of Gadd45a in the development of CML, adaptive bone marrow transplantation experiments with either wild type or Gadd45a null myeloid progenitors expressing 210-kD BCR-ABL fusion oncoprotein revealed that loss of Gadd45a accelerated BCR-ABL driven CML resulting in the development of a more aggressive AML/BC like disease. Recent newly obtained data indicate that number of Gadd45a deficient Leukemic stem cells (LSC) harboring BCR-ABL increased as disease progressed confirming Gadd45a as a crucial tumor suppressor in CML. Recent data also indicate, that transformed Gadd45a deficient progenitors exhibit increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis, associated with enhanced PI3K-AKT-mTOR-4E-BP1 signaling and upregulated oncogenic p30C/EBP\u03b1. More importantly, newly obtained data indicate that Gadd45a transcript levels in peripheral blood of human blast crisis (BC-CML) samples was found to be reduced compared to accelerated phase (AP-CML), chronic phase (CP-CML) and normal controls, assessed by Quantitative real time PCR analysis. Collectivly these data strongly suggest that Gadd45a expression is a novel prognostic indicator of CML progression, implicating Gadd45a as a downregulated target of BCR-ABL associated with progression to more aggressive stages. To conclude, our findings provide novel evidence that Gadd45a functions as a suppressor of BCR/ABL driven myeloid leukemogenesis, & that suppresion of Gadd45a is associated with CML progression. These data provide the impetus to further elucidate the role Gadd45a plays in suppressing the development of CML, and explore how its loss contributes to the progression of CML to more aggressive leukemic phenotypes.
