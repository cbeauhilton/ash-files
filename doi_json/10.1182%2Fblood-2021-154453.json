    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have an increased risk for venous thromboembolic events. Thrombotic events contribute to the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 infection, and have prompted investigation into strategies for mitigating thrombosis risk in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. Our team reviewed the charts of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia at a tertiary hospital in metropolitan Phoenix Arizona between 2020-2021, to assess frequency and efficacy of utilizing a VTE prophylaxis algorithm designed to prevent thrombosis in patients infected with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 846 patients were retrospectively evaluated to determine if they were treated with guideline-appropriate anticoagulation while hospitalized with COVID-19, as well as if they developed venous or arterial thrombotic events, or major or minor bleeds. 317 patients were excluded for taking therapeutic anticoagulation prior to admission, or for having a COVID-19 diagnosis >7 days after admission. Appropriate anticoagulation was determined by an institutionally designed COVID-19 thromboprophylaxis algorithm, based on platelet count, d-dimer, bleeding risk, and level of medical care required. Regimen options included: no anticoagulation, prophylactic enoxaparin (40 mg SQ daily) or heparin in the setting of kidney dysfunction, weight-based dosing of enoxaparin (40 mg SQ BID if BMI>40), intermediate intensity enoxaparin without thrombus (30 mg BID if BMI40), and therapeutic anticoagulation (for example enoxaparin 1 mg/kg BID) with thrombus. Demographics: Demographic data and clinical characteristics were collected for 529 patients. Average age was 59 years old, and the majority were men (58.4%). Most patients were White (58.3%), followed by Hispanic (17.8%), or Native American (15.7%). Fewer patients had a normal BMI (21.3%; BMI 18.5 - 24.9) compared to those who were overweight (31.2%; BMI 25-29.9) or obese (43.1% BMI > 30). Other comorbidities included Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus (N= 172, 32.5%), hypertension (N = 271, 51.2%), and hyperlipidemia (N = 176, 33.3%). Results: A total of 42 patients (8%), were diagnosed with a venous thrombosis during hospitalization. Patients admitted to the ICU were significantly more likely to have a thrombotic event of any type compared to non-ICU patients (21.6% to 5.7%; p < 0.001). Specifically, critically ill patients had higher incidences of deep vein thrombosis (9.5% to 0.7%), pulmonary emboli (8.1% to 4.8%), and superficial thrombi (2.7% to 0.2%). Only 1.1% of patients (6/529) experienced any bleeding, of which 3 were classified as a major bleed. Discussion: Among patients hospitalized at our institution with COVID-19, the majority were anticoagulated appropriately according to the COVID-19 thromboprophylaxis algorithm. Overall incidence of thrombosis in the study population was 8%. A significantly higher percent of critically ill patients had thrombi, supporting reports of correlation between severity of illness and thrombosis risk. The two regimens of anticoagulation least adhered to were weight-based and intermediate-based dosing, likely reflecting a departure from the hospital's thromboprophylaxis regimens prior to COVID-19 pandemic. Further studies are needed to characterize whether identifiable risk factors correlate with the incidence of thrombosis, and whether treatment with lower than recommended doses of anticoagulation, based on the COVID-19 thromboprophylaxis algorithm, were associated with thrombosis.
