    "abstract_text": "In EORTC-LCG AML-10 study patients with low CD34 mobilization profile showed a better outcome (Leukemia,2003,17:60-7). We hypothesized that patients with low pCD34 at the recovery period after RI therapy with de novo AML should have a better clinical outcome or vice versa and launched this prospective study. Between Jan 2002 and Oct 2004, 40 patients with AML (median age: 40 yrs, 17\u201360; 22M/18F) were enrolled to this study. Using flow cytometrical method CD34-expressing cells were measured in peripheral venous blood samples once WBC was between 1x10e9/L to 3x10e9/L at the recovery period after first RI therapy. Results: The median time for estimation of pCD34 was 23 days (7\u201335) after RI. The pCD34 cell count was lower in patients responding to first RI therapy (12x10e6/L vs 68x10e6/L, p=0.011). We observed a weak, but statistically significant positive correlation between CD34 expression of the blasts at diagnosis and pCD34 at recovery period (p=0.048, r2:0.322). We could not show any significant negative impact of CD34 expression of the blasts at diagnosis and response to first RI (p=0.059). Only two of 8 patients not responding to the 1 st RI achieved a complete remission after re-induction. The two-year probability of OS, LFS, relapse incidence and mortality rates were 47.1%, 37.2%, 55% and 42.5%, respectively (fig 1,2). If we set up a cut-off value of 18x10e6/L for pCD34, we did not observe any impact of pCD34 on relapse incidence but the mortality rate was significantly increased in patients with high CD34+ cell count (p=0.025). Conclusion: We were able to show a positive impact of pCD34 estimations after first RI in AML patients on both remission and mortality rate. AML Patients with lower pCD34 after 1 st RI tends to have a higher hematological remission rate and lower mortality. This impact of pCD34 as a predictive and prognostic marker in AML should be verified in large cohorts using multivariate analysis.
