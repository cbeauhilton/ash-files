    "abstract_text": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease. Patients\u2019 refractory to therapy may be considered for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Using lupus prone female NZB x NZW (NZBW) mice, we tested the ability of highly enriched, allogeneic HSC to prevent and reverse autoimmune symptoms with FACS purified haplo-identical allogeneic HSC. Ablative conditioning: 92 animals were given lethal TBI (14.5 Gy) and divided among 4 groups (Table 1). Urine and serology tested monthly, final time point before death tabulated. Transplantation with either syngeneic HSC or WBM accelerated disease in these mice, resulting in a rate of death exceeding age matched controls. Allogeneic transplanted mice had significantly greater survival above all groups (p= 0.0243). Proteinuria, elevated levels of circulating immune complexes (CIC), and auto-antibodies to dsDNA, nuclear antigens (ANA) and histones were lower in allo-HSC animals compared to the other ablative conditioning groups (p\u2264 0.0001). Overall survival (OS) in allo-HSC animals was still unexceptional, possibly due to regimen related toxicity (TRM). Table 1:  Ablative age@TX=75 days . Age Matched Control . Syngeneic WBM .

Animals were treated at ~241 days with established symptoms of lupus (Table 2). While the group receiving conditioning alone, had a slight survival advantage over age matched control mice, the transplanted mice had greatly increased OS with 70% living well beyond 500 days of age (>250 days from transplant). Allo-HSC mice showed reversal or stabilization of their lupus symptoms including proteinuria, CIC, dsDNA and histone. Table 2:  NMT age@Tx=241 days . Age Matched Control . Allogeneic HSC .

The ability of pure HSC transplant and establishment of durable mixed chimerism to reverse established lupus makes it a reasonable strategy to test in man.",
