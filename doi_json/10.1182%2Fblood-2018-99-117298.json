    "abstract_text": "Most of the 1,300 human hemoglobin (Hb) variants are characterized by normal O 2 binding, including here the highly prevalent Hbs S [HBB:c.20A>T; p.Glu6Val] and C [HBB:c.19G>A; p.Glu6Lys]. Hb S and Hb C carriers are generally asymptomatic and might be admitted as blood donors. However, the functional efficiency of these variants in standard blood bags - red blood cells (RBC) concentrates - under the interference of anticoagulant and storage is not well established. In this prospective study, three samples of RBC concentrates (phenotypes AA, AS and AC), with citrate phosphate dextrose adenine (CPDA-1) as anticoagulant, were analyzed for equilibrium tests and compared to fresh Hb A without anticoagulant. The Hb samples were extracted after 48 hours and 35 days of storage and purified by exclusion and ion exchange chromatography (Sephadex G-25 and Amberlite MB-3 columns in Hepes buffer without NaCl). O 2 affinity was evaluated by spectrophotometry-tonometry method, by determining the p50 in stripped lysates ([Hb]=70 \u03bcM/Heme), in pHs of 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0 and 8.5, for Bohr effect calculations. Heme-heme cooperativity was determined by Hill coefficient ( n ) in all studied pHs. The activity of allosteric effector in the Hb-O 2 ligation was also tested, using inositol hexaphosphate ([IHP]=1mM), a mimetic compound of the intraerythrocytic 2,3-BPG. The p50 of Hb A after 35 days in stored blood bag was decreased in all pHs, in both presence and absence of IHP, when compared to fresh Hb A, suggesting that the anticoagulant and the storage might affect HbA-O 2 binding, increasing its affinity for the ligand. No other differences were observed: heme-heme cooperativity and Bohr effect were similar to fresh Hb A without anticoagulant. The same was found when stored Hb AS was compared to Hb A from blood bag (35 days storage, in the stripped state and under the interference of IHP). However, the stripped lysate containing Hb AC revealed an important reduction of the O 2 affinity after both 48 hours and 35 days of storage, mainly at pHs \u00b3 7, thus interfering in the Bohr effect. The heme-heme cooperativity resulted in normal n coefficients, indicating that the Hb-O 2 ligation remained cooperative, in spite of the significant reduction of O 2 affinity. Similar results were observed in the presence of IHP (48 hours and 35 days), although Bohr effect was reestablished, indicating that the supplementation with a 2,3-BPG-like allosteric effector might restore some Hb-ion interactions, and therefore, Hb C function. As the 2,3-BPG is consumed with storage of RBC concentrates, Hb AC showed an even lower affinity for O 2 after 35 days of storage. Although still preliminary, our results indicate a significant functional reduction of Hb C in RBC concentrates in standard blood bag (CPDA-1 anticoagulant), proportional to the time of storage. Considering that the screening for hemoglobinopathies in the blood banks routine is mainly focused in the detection of Hb S, a greater understanding about the properties of native Hb and its most frequent variants in stored RBC concentrates could also contribute with the determination of safe parameters in hemotherapy based on the functional efficiency of each hemoglobin.
