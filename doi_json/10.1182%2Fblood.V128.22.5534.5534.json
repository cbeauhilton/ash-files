    "abstract_text": "Background In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), we have previously shown the adverse prognostic effect of ALC <1.2 x 10(9)/L ( Nisha et al. Am J Hematol 2010;85:160 ). In the current larger study of 889 patients with MDS, we sought to validate and expand on our previous observations and also examine the effect of lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR). Methods We retrospectively recruited 889 consecutive patients with primary MDS who were untreated at the time of referral to our institution, and in whom ALC and absolute monocyte count (AMC) at time of referral was documented. The diagnosis of MDS and leukemic transformation (LT) was according to WHO criteria ( Blood . 2009;114:937). Complete follow-up information was updated in January 2015. Comparison of laboratory and clinical features was made between patients with subnormal and normal ALC; patients with above normal ALC were considered separately. Overall and leukemia-free survivals of patients with normal ALC was compared to those with either subnormal ALC or, in order to validate our previous observation, with ALC <1.2 x 10(9)/L. Results Patient characteristics: Median (range) values for the 889 study patients (69% males) included: age 72 (18-98), hemoglobin 9.6 g/dL (5.4-15.7), leukocyte count 3.4 x 10(9)/L (0.4-35), AMC 0.2 x 10(9)/L (0-1.7), platelet count 106 x 10(9)/L (2-1804), circulating blasts 0% (0-18) and bone marrow blasts 3% (0-19). Transfusion need was documented in 33% of patients and abnormal karyotype in 49%. Risk stratification by the revised international prognostic scoring system (IPSS-R) was very high in 10%, high in 16%, intermediate in 20%, low in 36% and very low in 16%. The median (range) ALC for the entire study population of 889 patients was 1.16 x 10(9)/L (0.02-8.9). The normal range of ALC at our institution was 0.9-2.9 x 10(9)/L; the number of patients with subnormal, normal and above normal ALC was 261 (29%), 598 (67%) and 30 (4%), respectively. In addition, 442 (50%) and 417 (47%) patients had ALC below 1.2 x 10(9)/L and ALC between 1.2 and the upper limit of normal, respectively. After a median follow-up of 27 months, 712 (80%) deaths and 116 (13%) leukemic transformations were documented. Comparison of patients stratified by absolute lymphocyte count Compared to patients with normal ALC, patients with subnormal ALC displayed lower hemoglobin (p=0.002), higher red blood cell transfusion need (p=0.0003), lower leukocyte count (p<0.0001), lower monocyte count (p=0.002) and lower platelet count (p<0.0001), whereas borderline association was also apparent for older age (p=0.06). In univariate analysis, survival was adversely affected by lower ALC, treated as a continuous variable (p=0.01). Similarly, when compared to patients with normal ALC, patients with subnormal ALC (p=0.001; HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5) and those with ALC <1.2 x 10(9)/L (p=0.0002; HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2-1.6) experienced significantly shortened survival. There was no difference in survival between patients with above normal ALC and those with either subnormal (p=0.58) or normal (p=0.41) ALC; accordingly, patients with above normal ALC were excluded from subsequent analysis. In multivariable analysis, the adverse effect of subnormal ALC was shown to be independent of age, gender, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia , circulating blast percentage, bone marrow blast percentage or cytogenetic risk stratification by and IPSS; the same held true for ALC <1.2 x 10(9)/L. The association with IPSS-R was of borderline significance for both ALC <1.2 x 10(9)/L (p=0.06) and subnormal ALC (p=0.1). The adverse effect of ALC was most apparent in patients with very low or low risk disease per IPSS-R (p=0.0007 for subnormal ALC and 0.0003 for ALC <1.2 x 10(9)/L), compared to those with higher risk status (p=0.67 and 0.7, respectively). Neither subnormal ALC (p=0.4) nor ALC <1.2 x 10(9)/L (p=0.1) affected leukemia free survival. Analysis using LMR in place of ALC showed similar but not necessarily superior results. Conclusions Compared to those with normal ALC, MDS patients with either subnormal ALC or with ALC below 1.2 x 10(9)/L experienced shorter overall, but not leukemia-free, survival; this adverse effect was most apparent in lower risk patients and was independent of most of the currently established risk factors for survival in MDS. The observations from the current study suggest the possible therapeutic value of augmenting host immunity in lower risk MDS.
