    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5290 Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT) is caused by a deficiency in uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, an enzyme in the heme biosynthesic pathway. This leads to an excess of porphyrins, which cause blistering and skin fragility on sun exposure. The goals of treatment are iron depletion and reduction of plasma porphyrins to ameliorate skin symptoms. We reviewed the management of all PCT patients at St. Joseph's Hospital followed by the Hematology service, with the objective of describing their treatment course and its efficacy. The type of treatment received as well as the number and volume of phlebotomies were recorded. Outcomes of interest were skin symptom resolution (clinical remission) and biochemical remission, as measured by serum ferritin. Target ferritin was set at 30\u201350 \u03bcg/L. A total of 18 patients with PCT met our inclusion criteria; 14 males and 4 females. Three patients had the familial subtype of PCT while 15 had the sporadic form. Precipitants included alcohol, hepatitis C, hemochromatosis and estrogens. All patients received phlebotomy and three received hydroxychloroquine. Most patients were referred and initially diagnosed by dermatologists. The total volume of phlebotomies per patient ranged from 750\u20139500 mL for resolution of cutaneous symptoms which was achieved in 75% of patients. At the end of the study period, 15/18 (83%) patients were in clinical remission and 12/18 (67%) were in biochemical remission. Follow-up of PCT patients by a hospital hematology service allows for symptomatic control and biochemical remission in the vast majority of patients through the use of phlebotomy and occasionally hydroxychloroquine.
