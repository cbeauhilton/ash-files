    "abstract_text": "Background T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL) is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and often associated with autoimmune disorders. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is an oncogene, and its activation plays a key role in cell signaling transduction pathways in many types of cancer. The aim of the current study was to analyze the characteristics of T-LGLL. Methods We did this by determining the mutation status of STAT3 in 28 patients presenting with T-LGLL and evaluating STAT3 status in association with serum level of lacticdehydrogenase (LDH) and \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22-MG). Flow cytometric analysis for immunophenotype and TCR variable \u03b2-chain (V\u03b2) was performed in the patients. Results FC-V\u03b2 analysis was performed in 26 patients, and 22 (84.6%) patients had a restricted V\u03b2 reactivity pattern, with predominance of a single V\u03b2 mAb reactivity. There was no significant difference between serum LDH levels, gender, age or symptoms at diagnosis (P=0.062), lymphocytosis, anemia (P=0.057), thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, LGL count or STAT3 mutation status. However, high \u03b22-MG levels (P=0.005), neutropenia (P=0.018) and pure red blood cell aplasia (PRCA) (P=0.001) all displayed a significant association with STAT3 mutations. In univariate analysis, treatment-free survival (TFS) was affected by STAT3 mutation status (P=0.008) and \u03b22-MG (P=0.006). In multivariate analysis, only anemia (P<0.001) was found to be an independent risk factor of shorter TFS. Conclusions We found an incidence of STAT3 mutations of 21.4% in patients presenting with T-LGLL and two mutations, E616V and V671F, had not been previously reported. Our results further demonstrate the remarkable correlation of STAT3 mutation with anemia, neutropenia and \u03b22-MG. \u03b22-MG and LDH is commonly used laboratory indicators, and detecting of them is helpful in estimating clinical characteristics and guiding treatment. We conclude from our data that FC-V\u03b2 analysis is a fast and relatively economical alternative approach that can be used as a powerful tool in screening patients with suspected T-LGLL. Our study not only confirmed some of the previously reported observations, but it also provided new information on clinical associations, laboratory findings, prognostic factors, therapy and outcome in these patients.
