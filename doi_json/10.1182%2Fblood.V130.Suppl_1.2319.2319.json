    "abstract_text": "Objective: Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder in which platelet-reactive autoantibodies accelerate the destruction of platelets. Macrophages play a crucial role in ITP through IgG-Fc\u03b3 receptor-mediated platelet clearance. Patients responding to initial therapies often troubled with frequent relapses, severe reverse reactions and poor life quantity. Therefore, searching new effective strategies for ITP treatment is in urgent need. Methods: In this study, platelets coated with anti-CD41 antibodies, which can mimic autoantibody-binding platelets in ITP patients, were used as a smart drug delivery system to load vincristine (VCR). Vincristine-loaded platelets coated with anti-CD41 mAbs (CD41-VLP) can selective release VCR in macrophages through IgG-Fc\u03b3 receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and platelet aggregation assays were performed to evaluate the morphological and functional changes of CD41-VLP. The encapsulation efficiency, drug loading and intracellular VCR concentration were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Macrophages were derived from THP-1 induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). The expression of cell differentiation antigen (CD11b and CD14) and was detected by flow cytometry (FCM). The growth inhibition of CD41-VLP on macrophages was detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and the macrophage apoptosis was quantified by FCM. The possible mechanism of CD41-VLP on macrophages was further investigated by western blotting. Results: platelets coated with anti-CD41 antibodies could load VCR with high drug loading and encapsulation efficiency. There is no significant difference in morphology and function between platelets and CD41-VLP. Meanwhile, VCR was released from CD41-VLP in a pH-triggered behavior and VCR would be rapidly released in an acidic condition. The THP-1 derived macrophages was detected with a strong ability of phagocytosis and a high expression of CD11b and CD14. In the group of macrophages treated with CD41-VLP, intracellular concentration of VCR was significant increased compared with other groups, which demonstrates that Cd41-VLP can selectively deliver VCR to macrophages. In the CD41-VLP group, the growth inhibition rate was also much higher than other groups and the apoptosis rate was significant increased compared with other groups. These results suggest that CD41-VLP can enhance the cytotoxicity of VCR against macrophages. Furthermore, In the CD41-VLP group, the expressions of pro-apoptotic proteins,including Bax, caspase-3 and CyclinB1, were significantly increased and the expression of Bcl-2, anti-apoptotic protein, was decreased. This finding indicates that CD41-VLP might improve the effects of VCR on macrophages through regulating the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. Conclusion: CD41-VLP can improve the cytotoxicity of VCR against macrophages, thus establishing a new targeted therapy for ITP treatment. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
