    "abstract_text": "Ethical issues are connatural with the medical activity. Moral questions regarding some medical specialities as obstetrics or pre or perinatal medicine are well known. Nevertheless few is known about ethical problems perceived as remarkable from physicians and patients in onco-hematology. This is a retrospective monocentric descriptive study. Its purpose is to recognize, in oncohematology, what are the problems perceived as ethically relevant both from physicians and patients. Ethical issues regarding onco-hematologic patients were recognized consulting clinical diary of 100 patients treated in our institution. Patients have casually been selected in the temporal period from January 2004 to June of 2008. Ethical questions were listed in two groups: those perceived as remarkable for the physicians and those for the patients. Median age of the patients was 54.5 years (R 33\u201386). M/F was 55/45. Sixty-one patients were affected by chronic or indolent hemopathies. Sixty-six patients received 1 st line therapy, instead 34 2 nd line or superior. Seventy-five patients had primary school instruction, 22 secondary, 3 had got a degree. Eighty patients were assisted by a relative. Twenty-nine patients perceived a problem as ethically relevant (5 compliance to treatments; 5 refusal of treatment; 7 intolerance to hospitalization; 9 scarce trust in caregivers; 3 difficulty to understand the therapeutic plan). In 38 cases physicians perceived a problem as ethically relevant (8 over treatment; 7 type of treatment to adopt; 8 correct timing of therapy; 11 correct use of resources; 4 adequacy of treatment). Physicians perceived these problems mainly about patients requiring 2 nd line treatment or further (28 cases out of 38). In 12 cases only patients perceived a problem, in 21 cases only physicians perceived a problem, while in 17 cases a problem was perceived as ethically relevant by physicians and patients simultaneously. In our study, in onco-hematology the main issue perceived by patients as ethically relevant is the scarce trust in caregivers, while for physicians it is the correct use of resources. Physicians perceive an ethical problem mainly considering patient candidate to 2 nd line treatment or further. In 24% of cases, a problem perceived as ethically relevant by patients is underestimated by physicians. In this contest the possibility of an ethical consultation within a clinical counselling might create a convergence between physician and patient perspective."
