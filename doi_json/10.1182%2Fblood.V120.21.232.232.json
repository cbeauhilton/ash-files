    "abstract_text": "Abstract 232 Unrelated cord blood (UCB) is an alternative source of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for adults with acute leukemia lacking a HLA matched donor. Double cord blood unit (dUCBT) has been increasingly used over single CB unit (sUCBT) after reduced intensity conditioning regimen (RIC). Since there is an increased relapse incidence (RI) using RIC-HSCT compared to myeloablative conditioning regimen, we have driven the hypothesis that RI may be decreased and leukemia-free survival (LFS) rate increased after dUCBT compared to sUCBT, due to probably increased graft-versus leukemia (GVL) effect. With this aim, we analyzed 360 adults (>18 years) with ALL (n= 77) or AML (n=238) in CR1 (n=212) and in CR2 (n=148) transplanted with a sUCBT (n=131) or a dUCBT (n=229) after a RIC. Only patients transplanted with a single unit containing more than 2.5\u00d710 7 /kg total nucleated cells (TNC) were included. Patients were transplanted from 2005\u20132011 in EBMT centers. Comparing the two groups of patients receiving a sUCBT or a dUCBT in CR1, there were no statistical differences according to age, diagnosis (AML or ALL), weight, CMV serostatus, cytogenetics risk, number of HLA incompatibilities. However, dUCBT were performed more recently (2009 vs 2008), the time from CR1 to transplantation was longer (142 days vs 121 days), more frequently transplanted with CY+FLU+TBI2Gy (87% vs 68%), lower frequency of ATG use (21% vs 35%) and finally, dUCBT recipients received higher number of TNC collected (5\u00d710 7 /kg vs 3.9\u00d710 7 /kg) or infused (4\u00d710 7 /kg vs 3.1\u00d710 7 /kg). Median follow-up was 23 months in both groups. Cumulative incidence (CI) of 60 days neutrophil recovery was 82\u00b13% after dUCBT and 76\u00b12% after sUCBT (p=0.86) and frequency of full donor chimerism at day 100, was not statistically different between dUCBT (81%) and sUCBT (86%). At day 100, CI of acute GVHD (grade II-IV) was 35% in both groups, however there was a trend of increased incidence of grade III-IV after sUCBT (19%) compared to dUCBT (10%, p=0.06) but increased incidence of grade II aGVHD after dUCBT (28%) compared to 17% after sUCBT (p=0.05). CI of chronic GvHD at 2 years was 21\u00b14% after dUCBT and it was 12\u00b15% after sUCBT (p=0.15). At 2 years, CI of non relapse mortality (NRM) after dUCBT was 28\u00b14% and it was 30\u00b16% after sUCBT (p=0.87). However, CI of 2y relapse was 21\u00b14% after dUCBT whereas it was 38\u00b12% after sUCBT (p=0.03). In a multivariate analysis adjusting for the differences between the 2 groups, dUCBT was associated with lower incidence of relapse compared to sUCBT (HR=0.74, p=0.01). Therefore, there was an improved 2-y LFS after dUCBT (51\u00b15%) compared to sUCBT (32\u00b13%; p=0.03). This was confirmed in a multivariate analysis (HR=0.64, p=0.04). Concerning patients transplanted in CR2 (n=148), there were no statistically differences of outcomes after dUCBT (n=93) or sUCBT (n=55). At 2y, LFS was 40\u00b16% after dUCBT and 48\u00b13% after sUCBT (p=0.32). In a subgroup analysis of dUCBT (n=118) and sUCBT (n=51) recipients using the same conditioning regimen (CY+FLU+TBI2Gy), 2 y LFS were 54\u00b15% and 33\u00b17% respectively (p=0.05). Conclusion: In this retrospective comparative based registry analysis, in AL patients transplanted in CR1, neutrophil recovery, GVHD and NRM were not statistically different after RIC-dUCBT or RIC-sUCBT, however, dUCBT recipients had decreased relapse incidence and improved LFS. For AL patients transplanted in CR2, there was no benefit of using dUCBT when compared to sUCBT recipients. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
