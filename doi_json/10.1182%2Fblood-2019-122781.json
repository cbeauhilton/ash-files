    "abstract_text": "Introduction The ECHELON-2 study (NCT01777152) demonstrated significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival with brentuximab vedotin plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (A+CHP) versus CHOP in the frontline treatment of patients (pts) with sALCL or other CD30-expressing PTCL and supported the 2018 FDA approval in this setting. Consistent with current guidelines, pts could have received consolidative stem cell transplant (SCT) after treatment at the discretion of the treating investigator. In all pts treated with A+CHP, only 22% (50 of 226) underwent SCT. Herein, we present outcomes from an exploratory analysis of pts in a complete remission (CR) following A+CHP who received an SCT and those who did not. Methods CR rate was defined at the end of treatment (EOT) by independent review per the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. ALK+ sALCL pts were excluded because they tend to have more favorable outcomes. Consolidative transplant was not considered a PFS event. A univariate analysis of SCT versus no SCT and multivariate analyses adjusting for region and age were performed. Results Sixty-seven percent (76/113 pts) of pts with ALK- sALCL on the A+CHP arm were in CR at EOT and 36% (27/76) of them received SCT. Pts who underwent SCT were younger, with a median age of 50 years (yr) (range 18-68) compared with 59 yr (range 20-85) in those without SCT. Median PFS for pts with SCT was not reached (95% CI 36.57, not estimable [NE]) versus 55.66 mos (95% CI 23.72, 55.66) for pts without SCT. Fifty-nine percent (38/64) of pts with non-sALCL on the A+CHP arm were in CR at EOT and 29% (11/38) of them received SCT. Pts who underwent SCT were younger than those without (median age 57 yr [35-73] vs 66 yr [49-77]). Median PFS for pts who did and did not receive SCT was not reached (95% CI 20.70, NE) versus 33.22 mos (95% CI 8.08, NE), respectively. Prior to treatment start, the intent to transplant in Asian countries among ALK- sALCL and non-ALCL pts was less frequent in comparison to non-Asian countries (13% and 29% vs 49% and 57%, respectively). The proportion of pts ultimately transplanted was also less frequent (13% and 12% in Asia versus 32% and 23% in non-Asian countries). Standard PFS and multivariate proportional hazards regression analyses favored the use of SCT in PTCL pts in a CR after A+CHP (Table). Conclusions Numerical PFS estimates favor the use of SCT in PTCL pts in a CR after A+CHP; however, sample sizes are small. It is also recognized that unknown confounders may impact this post-hoc analysis. We observed that use of SCT was infrequent in Asian countries, suggesting regional practice differences. The overall impact of consolidative SCT remains unconfirmed, including in patients treated with A+CHP. Further studies are needed to establish its role in this setting.
