    "abstract_text": "Background : Mcl-1 is an anti-apoptotic protein in the Bcl-2 family that contributes to the pathophysiology of certain B-cell malignancies and AML. Dependence on Mcl-1 is associated with poor prognosis, and increased Mcl-1 levels is a common mechanism of resistance to venetoclax. Voruciclib (VORU), a potent oral CDK9 inhibitor (Ki <10 nM), was shown to decrease Mcl-1 protein expression in preclinical models, supporting its evaluation as a single agent and in combination with venetoclax in AML and B-cell malignancies. In two dose escalation phase 1 studies of VORU in patients (pts) with solid tumors, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was established at 350 mg when administered daily continuously and 600 mg when administered on days 1 to 14 in a 21-day cycle. Based on concentrations needed for antitumoral activity in preclinical models, pharmacokinetic (PK) results predict a dose of ~200 mg could be sufficient for target inhibition. The present phase 1 study is the first to evaluate the MTD, recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), safety, PK, and preliminary efficacy of VORU in pts with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies (NCT03547115). Methods : Pts with relapsed B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), or AML were eligible if age \u226518 years, ECOG performance status \u22641, disease progression after failure of standard therapies, adequate hepatic and renal function, and no prior CDK9 therapy. Dose escalation started at 50 mg, followed a 3+3 design, and DLTs were assessed in Cycle 1. Initially VORU was administered once daily continuously in a 28-day cycle (Group I). After 2 DLTs were observed at 100 mg, administration was changed to once daily on days 1 to 14 in a 28-day cycle (Group II), patients with prior allogeneic transplant were excluded, and dose escalation (100, 150, 200 mg) proceeded in separate cohorts for AML and B-cell malignancies. Disease response was assessed by the Lugano, iwCLL, and 2017 ELN criteria. Results : To date 28 pts have been enrolled: 14 AML, 7 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 3 follicular lymphoma (FL), 2 CLL and 2 mantle cell lymphoma. Group I enrolled 16 pts, 8 each at 50 mg and 100 mg. Group II enrolled 12 pts, 10 with AML administered VORU at 100, 150 or 200 mg and 2 pts with B-cell malignancies administered VORU at 100 mg. Dose escalation in AML is completed. Median age was 71 years (range 40-90) and 54% of pts were male. Pts were generally heavily pretreated, with a median of 3 prior therapies (range 1-8). Median number of VORU cycles administered was 2 (range 1-4). Drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in Group I only and consisted of 2 DLT of Gr 3 pneumonitis at 100 mg, both in AML pts treated with allogeneic transplant followed by GVHD in the preceding 12 months, one of whom also had a concurrent Gr 3 differentiation syndrome (DS), and 1 SAE not meeting DLT criteria, a Gr 3 hypoxemic respiratory failure in Cycle 4 in a pt with DLBCL at 50 mg. One AML pt developed ischemic bowel thought to be due to disease progression. Symptoms consistent with DS were observed in 4 AML pts. In Group II, no DLTs have been observed to date and there were no Gr 3-5 drug-related adverse events reported. There is no evidence of significant drug-related neutropenia in pts with B-cell malignancies. To date, in Groups I and II combined, 1 AML pt achieved a morphologic leukemia-free state, 2 AML pts achieved stable disease (SD), and 3 pts with B-cell malignancies had a best response of SD, including 1 FL pt who achieved a 42% reduction in SPD, and 1 CLL pt with relapsed disease after chemoimmunotherapy, venetoclax, and ibrutinib who had stable blood counts. Conclusions : VORU at doses up to 200 mg administered on 14 consecutive days in a 28-day cycle was well tolerated with no DLTs observed. Consistent with the phase 1 studies in solid tumors, no significant myelosuppression was seen in pts with B-cell malignancies. The safety profile does not indicate overlapping toxicities with venetoclax. Disease stabilization was observed in heavily pretreated pts and differentiation syndrome was observed in AML indicating biologic activity. Enrollment at 200 mg will continue in an expansion cohort in AML. A forthcoming protocol amendment will evaluate VORU in combination with venetoclax in pts with relapsed AML to exploit the dual inhibition of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1.
