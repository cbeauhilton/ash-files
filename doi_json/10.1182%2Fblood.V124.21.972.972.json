    "abstract_text": "Infants with MLL rearranged (MLLr) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have a poor prognosis, with an event free survival of only 23-44%. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of this subtype has revealed a paucity of cooperating mutations, with an average of 2.2 somatic single nucleotide variations and/or insertions/deletions per case. Despite recent progress in defining the epigenetic alterations that result from the expression of the MLL fusion protein, these insights have only recently begun to be extrapolated into the development of new therapeutic approaches whose benefits have yet to be defined. Thus, there remains an urgent need for the development of alternative approaches to improve outcomes in these patients. To identify compounds that are active in MLLr disease, we established in vitro and in vivo assays to evaluate drug sensitivity of primary infant ALL patient samples. 15 infant MLLr leukemia samples that have previously undergone WGS were xenografted into NOD/SCID/IL2R\u03b3 null (NSG) mice. All samples engrafted and expanded in NSG mice, leading to overt leukemia with a latency of 49 to 276 days. Purification of leukemic blasts from a single moribund mouse yielded on average 10 8 cells, providing sufficient material to screen large numbers of compounds. In vitro conditions were defined that support growth in 40% of the patient specimens, allowing for a more accurate determination of drug sensitivity. Growth in vitro was associated with early onset of disease in NSG xenografts and younger age at presentation, allowing us to evaluate patient samples that represent aggressive high risk disease. Using this system, we tested bortezomib in addition to 28 other drugs, including standard ALL therapeutic agents as well as targeted kinase inhibitors and inhibitors of epigenetic marks. Three classes of agents were active in this system: anthracyclines, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. In contrast to anthracyclines and HDACi, where IC50 values were on par with those reported in the literature for primary childhood ALL samples, MLLr infant samples required 10-100 fold less bortezomib to induce toxicity. Bortezomib has been shown to mediate responses through several mechanisms, including NFKB inhibition, stabilization of cell cycle regulatory proteins, and induction of apoptosis. Recently, proteasome inhibition has been demonstrated to lead to accumulated MLL fusion protein levels, triggering apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in MLLr cell lines. To determine if NFKB inhibition also plays a role, we evaluated cellular concentrations of the activated NFKB transcription factor, but failed to see decreased levels when MLLr cells were treated with bortezomib. Bortezomib has also been shown to deregulate ubiquitin stores and deplete histone H2B ubiquitination (H2Bub), an epigenetic mark that is linked to histone methylation and expression. Recently, several groups have demonstrated that H2Bub is required for DOT1L activity and HOX gene expression. We therefore evaluated H2Bub levels in bortezomib-treated patient samples and confirmed depletion of this epigenetic mark. Furthermore, patient samples treated with bortezomib downregulated both the MLL gene expression signature and signatures of downstream targets, such as cMYC, demonstrating that the MLL transcriptional program is inhibited in the presence of bortezomib. ChIP-seq is underway to map H2Bub and H3K79 methylation changes genome wide in response to treatment with bortezomib. The HDACi vorinostat and bortezomib have both been evaluated in Phase I and II pediatric leukemia clinical trials. Based on the safety and efficacy from these earlier studies, we treated 6 relapsed/refractory MLLr leukemia patients with a chemotherapy regimen that included mitoxantrone, vorinostat, and bortezomib. 4 patients had a complete response (CR), 1 patient had a partial response (PR) and 1 patient had stable disease for an overall response rate of 5/6 (83%). Clinical trials are in development to assess this combination further for both relapsed MLLr disease as well as newly diagnosed infant ALL. Our data suggests that these three classes of drugs, identified in our laboratory assays, are clinically active thus validating our system. We are now using this platform to proceed with a high throughput drug screen to identify additional compounds for future clinical development.
