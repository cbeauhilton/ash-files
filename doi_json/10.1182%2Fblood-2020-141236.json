    "abstract_text": "Background Significant efforts over the past few years led Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy to success in relapsed and refractory (r/r) B-cell malignancies. Still logistical complexity, high costs and toxicities are currently the main barriers to the use of CAR T cell therapy. We therefore propose non-viral engineering of an allogeneic T cell population according to cytokine induced killer (CIK) cell protocol of differentiation. Methods We reported the updated results of our phase I/II trial in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients relapsed after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using donor-derived CD19 CAR T cells generated with the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon and differentiated into CIK (CARCIK-CD19) according to the method enclosed in the filed patent EP20140192371. After lymphodepletion with Fludarabine (30 mg/m 2 /day) x 4 days and Cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m 2 /day) x 2 days, CARCIK-CD19 were infused following a four-dose escalation scheme (1x10 6 , 3x10 6 , 7.5x10 6 and 15x10 6 transduced CAR+ T cells/kg) according to the Bayesian Optimal Interval Design (BOIN). During the cell manufacturing period, bridging anti leukemic therapy from patient registration to the beginning of the lymphodepletion, was allowed. The primary endpoint was to define the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the safety assessment. Key secondary endpoints included the assessment of complete hematologic response (CR), defined as < 5% bone marrow (BM) blasts, circulating blasts < 1%, no clinical evidence of extramedullary disease, as well as the characterization of CARCIK-CD19 persistence in PB and BM (NCT03389035). Results The cellular product was produced successfully for all patients starting from the donor-derived peripheral blood (PB) and consisted mostly of CD3+ lymphocytes (mean 98.85% \u00b1SD 1.19%) with a mean of 38.6% CAR expression (range 15.10%-73.17%). From January 2018 to July 2020, a total of 24 patients were screened, and 15 were enrolled (4 children and 11 adults) and infused with a single dose of CARCIK-CD19 (n=3 HLA identical sibling, n=4 MUD, n=8 haploidentical donor). The leukemic burden in the BM post lymphodepletion/pre-infusion ranged from 0% to 96%. Robust expansion was achieved in the majority of the patients. The maximal expansion reached about 1x10 6 transgene copies per \u03bcg DNA and 70% of CAR+ T cells in PB. CD8+ T cells represented the predominant circulating CAR+ T cell subset. Persistence of central memory CAR+ T cells was observed after infusion and CAR T cells were measurable up to 9 months. CARCIK-CD19 were characterized by a high profile of safety in all treated patients. Toxicities reported were two grade I and two grade II cytokine release syndrome (CRS) cases at the highest dose in the absence of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), neurotoxicity, or dose-limiting toxicities. Seven out of 9 patients, receiving the highest doses, achieved CR and CRi at day 28. MRD-negative status for all responders was achieved by 6 out of 9 patients (1 currently in evaluation). The two patients in CR but with MRD+ relapsed with a CD19+ disease at +2.3 and +1.9 months post infusion, respectively. Among the 6 patients who achieved MRD-negative CR, two children underwent consolidation with a second allo-HSCT and are still alive and disease free (+17 and +13 months), two adult patients died of subsequent CD19+ disease relapse and two adult patients are still alive and disease free (+14 and +12 months) without additional therapies. The distribution profile of integration sites (IS) showed no preference for gene dense or promoter regions, and no particular differences between pre- and post- infusion sample IS. Samples harvested at early time points after infusion showed a highly polyclonal repertoire. At later time points (\u2265 28 days after infusion) the repertoire of IS showed a marked reduction towards oligoclonality, in absence of specific dominant clones. Conclusions We can conclude that SB-engineered CAR T cells expand and persist in pediatric and adult B-ALL patients relapsed after HSCT. Sustained response was achieved without severe toxicities. All analyzed samples appear to have a highly polyclonal IS repertoire and no signs of genotoxicity by transposon insertions could be observed.
