    "abstract_text": "Human blood platelets contain unique and reproducible molecular signatures consisting of relatively small number of individual mRNA transcripts. Towards the goal of developing a molecular classification of platelet disorders, we have now developed and applied a unique microarray platform for the study of thrombocytosis. A 432-member gene list encompassing a subset of platelet- and leukocyte- restricted transcripts (with Arabidopsis probe elements as normalization controls) was used for the manufacturing of a customized platelet oligonucleotide (70-mer) gene chip (POC). In silico gene rank-intensity plots from sample RNAs [normal platelets (N=5); essential thrombocythemic platelets (ET; N=6); leukocytes (N=3)] hybridized to the Affymetrix HU133a gene chip validated the discriminatory capacity of the POC, which was then applied to a broader patient cohort. Gel-filtered platelets from normal controls (N=28), patients with ET (N=18), or patients with reactive thrombocytosis (RT; N=17) were used for RNA isolation, amplification, and Cy3:Cy5 co-hybridization using human universal RNA as reference. Genotyping for the presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation was established by pyrosequencing analysis using both genomic (leukocyte) DNA and platelet-derived mRNA. Initial two-way non-parametric ANOVA identified a 131-member gene list of differentially-expressed transcripts among the three subgroups (p<0.05), with no gender differences in healthy controls. Stepwise discriminant analysis delineated a 14-gene subset that appropriately classified 94% of original cases. Leave-one-out cross-validation using 3 of the 14 markers correctly classified 94% ET and 100% RT patients, independent of the presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation. Leave-one-out cross-validation using 6 of the 14 markers also correctly subclassified 88% ET patients with JAK2 V617F mutation (N = 8) and 90% of ET patients without such mutation (N = 10). These data (1) provide the first evidence for the existence of discriminatory molecular signatures among etiologically-diverse causes of thrombocytosis, (2) demonstrate the presence of distinct ET transcriptomic profiles substratified by JAK2 V617F genotype, and (3) provide the foundation for development of a clinically-useful classification scheme of genetic platelet disorders.",
