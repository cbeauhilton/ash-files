    "abstract_text": "FL is the most common indolent nodal lymphoma and considered incurable for the majority of patients. Virtually all patients eventually develop resistant disease, and up to 45% histologic transformation (tFL) with poor outcome. Alterations associated with progression to tFL include increased copy number variations (e.g. CDKN2A deletions, MYC amplification), acquisition of additional translocations (e.g. MYC or BCL6 ), and higher mutation load (including TP53 ). However the underlying molecular mechanisms promoting this genomic instability remain elusive. Interestingly, histologic transformation occurs at a remarkably constant rate of ~3% per year implying a rather stochastic process. We previously described convergent evolution for disruptive ARID1A mutations in FLs of a donor and the recipient patient following an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation ( Weigert, Canc Discovery 2012 ). The independent acquisition of ARID1A loss in two separate hosts after transplantation of an identical FL ancestor clone suggested (i) a later acquired event in the molecular ontogeny and (ii) functional relevance. ARID1A promotes the formation of SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complexes containing BRG1 or BRM, which catalyze disruption of DNA-histone contacts, thereby controlling chromatin condensation and DNA accessibility. Nucleosome-remodelling has been linked to DNA damage response, including nucleotide and base excision repair, homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). We thus hypothesized that ARID1A haplodeficiency might contribute to genetic and genomic instability in FL. In a cohort of 305 FL specimens, we identified 44 ARID1A mutations in 43 patients (14%). The majority of these mutations were disruptive (66%; 19 nonsense and 10 frame shift mutations), 6 cases harbored splice site mutations. MutSigCV analysis ( Lawrence, Nature 2013 ) indicated that ARID1A was significantly mutated in FL, i.e. more often than expected by chance given background mutation processes. Consistent with our hypothesis, the number of non-synonymous mutations in 104 targeted genes was higher in ARID1A mutated FLs (5.6+0.34, mean+sem ) compared to ARID1A wild-type (wt) FLs (4.7+0.12; p=0.0099 ), and similar compared to 17 FLs with TP53 mutations (5.6+0.12). Of note, ARID1A and TP53 mutations were mutually exclusive. For functional studies, we confirmed deleterious ARID1A alterations in 6 lymphoma cell lines (Namalwa, Karpas422, SUPHD-1, SU-DHL5, WSU-FSCCL, U-OH1). Immunoblotting showed decreased ARID1A protein expression in all 6 lines compared to 5 ARID1A wt lymphomas. Tet-induced re-expression of ARID1A in two tested ARID1A mutant cell lines (Namalwa and SUP-HD1) reduced cell proliferation compared to tet-induced control (LacZ), but had no effect in ARID1A wt OCI-Ly1. As a proof-of-principle experiment we assayed the impact of ARID1A loss on DNA double strand break (DSB) repair efficiency in genetically well defined mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), avoiding uncontrolled bias introduced by the genetic and genomic complexity in lymphoma cell lines. Early passage MEFs from either wt or conditional ARID1A knock-out mice ( ARID1A f/f ; Gao, PNAS 2008 ) were transiently transfected or retrovirally transduced with self-excising Cre-recombinase ( Silver&Livingston, Mol Cell 2001 ) or control, and irradiated with 2 Gy after 36 hrs. Cre-induced ARID1A loss was confirmed by Western blot. To assay NHEJ, the predominate DSB-repair pathway used by cells in G1 phase, we stained cells for \u03b3H2A.X and 53BP1. In 3 independent and blinded experiments, evaluation of >100 cells per condition demonstrated significantly more double-positive cells (>6 foci/cell) in ARID1A -/- MEFs (43+14%) compared to both ARID1A f/f MEFs (9+1%) and Cre-exposed wt MEFs (15+5%) at 16 hrs post irradiation, whereas there was no significant difference for ARID1A f/f or wt MEFs with or without Cre at baseline (all 50%). This data indicates that ARID1A loss slows the repair kinetics of NHEJ and delays the clearance of DSB. We conclude that ARID1A is recurrently and significantly mutated in FL. Most mutations are disruptive leading to functionally relevant ARID1A protein haplodeficiency. ARID1A loss impairs NHEJ, which might sensitize tumors to DNA damaging agents and irradiation, but also contribute to genetic and genomic instability promoting histologic transformation.
