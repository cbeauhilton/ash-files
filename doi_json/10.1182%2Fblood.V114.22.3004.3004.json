    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3004 Poster Board II-981 Protein Kinase C-delta (PKC\u03b4) is a novel PKC isoform that differentially regulates platelet dense granule secretion. PKC\u03b4 positively regulates Protease activated receptor (PAR)-mediated dense granule secretion, whereas it negatively regulates glycoproteinVI (GPVI)-mediated dense granule secretion in platelets. PKC\u03b4, a serine/threonine kinase is phosphorylated on its tyrosine residues. There are nine potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the regulatory domain of PKC\u03b4. Phosphorylation at different tyrosine residues regulates its substrate specificity. We have previously shown that the association of PKC\u03b4 with Lyn and SHIP-1 negatively regulates GPVI-mediated dense granule secretion. However, the event leading to the association between PKC\u03b4 and SHIP-1 is not known. We hypothesize that the differential tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC\u03b4 downstream of PARs or GPVI receptors result in the preferential association with SHIP-1. In the current study, we show that PKC\u03b4 is phosphorylated at tyrosine residues Y332, Y523, Y525 and Y565 upon PAR or GPVI stimulation. Y311 residue is predominantly phosphorylated upon stimulation of PARs, whereas Y155 residue is preferentially phosphorylated upon GPVI stimulation. PAR-mediated Y311 phosphorylation peaks at later timepoint, whereas GPVI-mediated Y155 phosphorylation peaks at an early timepoint. correlating with dense granule secretion. Furthermore, we show that agarose-conjugated Y155 phosphorylated PKC\u03b4 peptide associates with SHIP-1 upon GPVI stimulation, and not PARs. These data suggest that the phosphorylation of PKC\u03b4 at distinct tyrosine residues differentially regulate its association with SHIP-1. Therefore, we conclude that the GPVI-mediated phosphorylation of PKC\u03b4 at 155 is required for its association with SHIP-1.
