    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The primary effector of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) system is angiotensin II. RAS activation causes many detrimental effects via AT1 receptor. Angiotensin-(1-7)/ angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/Mas axis is a newly identified counter-regulatory pathway against RAS system. Thrombin plays a critical role in coagulation and inflammation processes in vascular endothelium. Although RAS activation is associated with thrombotic complications, it is unknown whether angiotensin-(1-7) can modulate the pleotropic effects of thrombin. In this study, we investigate the proteomic changes of angiotensin-(1-7) effects on thrombin-stimulated human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Materials and methods: HAECs were pretreated with 10 -7 M anigotenion-(1-7) for 1 h and stimulated with 2 units/mL thrombin for additional 5 h. Their proteomes were investigated using isobaric tags for the relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) and MetaCore TM software. Results: A total of 653, 717 and 801 proteins were identified in triplicated iTRAQ analyses. MetaCore TM pathway analysis identified that iTRAQ data showed the consistent pathway alterations (70%) in triplicated experiments. The same altered pathways included \"Cytoskeleton remodeling_Cytoskeleton remodeling\", \"Cell adhesion_Integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration\", \"Cell adhesion_Chemokines and adhesion\" , \"Cytoskeleton remodeling _ Regulation of actin cytoskeleton by Rho GTPases\", \"LRRK2 in neurons in Parkinson's disease\", \"Cytoskeleton remodeling_Fibronectin-binding integrins in cell motility\", \"Cytoskeleton remodeling _TGF, WNT and cytoskeletal remodeling\" were among the top 10 statistically significant pathways. Additional experiments validated the phenotypes of angiotensin-(1-7) effects in thrombin-stimulated HAECs. Conclusions: Several regulatory pathways are altered by angiotensin-(1-7) in thrombin-stimulated HAECs, with cytoskeleton remodeling, cell adhesion and cell migration (motility) as the dominant altered phenotypes.
