    "abstract_text": "Introduction New treatment options are needed for patients (pts) with R/R NHL, particularly in MCL where there are no curative options. Dysregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 is a hallmark of NHL pathogenesis and contributes to chemotherapy resistance. ABT-199 is a selective, potent, orally bioavailable small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor that is a promising agent for the treatment of pts with NHL. Methods The primary objectives of this phase I, dose-escalation study were to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK), and to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ABT-199. Secondary objectives were to assess the efficacy of ABT-199 and to explore biomarkers for response. Adult pts requiring therapy, with ECOG performance status \u22641 and adequate marrow function (ANC \u22651.0 x 10 9 /L, Plt \u226550 x 10 9 /L) received ABT-199 on Week 1 Day -7 (W1D-7), followed by continuous, once-daily dosing from W1D1 until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. A 2 to 3 week lead-in period with stepwise escalation starting with lower doses to final cohort doses of 200, 300, 400, 600, and 900 mg was implemented. Evaluations include adverse events (AE; NCI-CTCAE-V4), PK parameters and disease responses (IWG 2007 criteria). Results As of July 4, 2013, 32 pts were enrolled, 11 (34%) with follicular (FL), 8 (25%) with MCL, 8 (25%) with diffuse large B-cell (DLBCL), 1 (3%) with marginal zone (MZL), 3 (9%) with Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia (WM), and 1 (3%) multiple myeloma (MM). The median age was 68 (range 35-85), 63% were male with a median of 3.5 prior therapies (range 1-7), and the median time on study was 6.0 months (range 0.5-15.0). 44% of the pts had bulky disease \u22655 cm, including \u226510 cm in 16%. 22 pts have discontinued (D/C) drug: 18 due to progressive disease, 2 due to AEs, and 2 who proceeded to stem cell transplant in ongoing response. The most common AEs of any grade (G) occurring in \u226520% of pts were nausea (41%), diarrhea (31%), vomiting (22%), fatigue (22%), and upper respiratory tract infection (22%). G 3/4 AEs occurring in >3 pts were anemia (15%), neutropenia (13%), and thrombocytopenia (13%). G 3/4 thrombocytopenia was not dose-dependent or dose-limiting. Two of 10 pts in cohort 5 experienced a DLT (G3 febrile neutropenia and G4 neutropenia) at the target dose of 600 mg. G3 laboratory tumor lysis syndrome was seen after the initial dose in 1 pt with bulky MCL (elevations in phosphate and potassium only) and 1 pt with DLBCL (elevations in phosphate and uric acid only). After a single dose with food, ABT-199 had T max and T 1/2 of approximately 8 and 15 hours, respectively. Food increased ABT-199 bioavailability by 3-4 fold. Preliminary efficacy data are summarized in the table. Table Overall Responses in ABT-199 Treated NHL Patients  Histology . Overall Response (CR + PR) . Complete Response n (%) .

Anti-tumor activity was seen in all MCL and WM pts treated across the range of ABT-199 cohort doses, and responses in DLBCL and FL pts were observed at doses \u2265600 mg. Dose escalation is continuing to determine the MTD and RP2D. Biomarker studies are also underway in various NHL subtypes to explore a potential correlation with response.
