    "abstract_text": "Background: AML is driven by a small subpopulation of leukemia stem cells (LSCs), which possess stem-cell properties such as quiescence and self-renewal that are linked to therapy resistance and relapse. The LSC17 score was derived from genes differentially expressed between functionally validated LSC+ and LSC- cell fractions from 78 AML patients. The LSC17 score was strongly associated with survival in 4 independent cohorts of AML patients treated with curative intent (n = 908), and accurately predicted initial response. Patients with high LSC17 scores had poor outcomes with standard treatment strategies. The LSC17 score remained highly significant in multivariate analyses, independent of commonly used prognostic factors. A critical advantage of the LSC17 test over cytogenetic analysis is its rapid turnaround time (24-48h on a NanoString platform), providing clinicians with a powerful tool for upfront risk stratification. To date, no RNA-based, stem cell-derived score has been transitioned into a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory. Study design and methods: The study consists of 2 phases. Phase 1 aims to validate the assay in a CLIA certified laboratory setting. Phase 2 aims to determine prospectively the feasibility and prognostic power of LSC17 score testing in newly diagnosed AML patients in the real-world setting. Clinical endpoints include primary induction failure rate, relapse free survival and overall survival. All patients with a suspected diagnosis of de novo or secondary AML, who are deemed fit and appropriate by their treating physician to undergo intensive induction chemotherapy, are considered for this study. Patients who received any prior anti-leukemia treatments (except hydroxyurea) and patients with a confirmed diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia are excluded. Current participating centres include Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (Toronto), Juravinski Cancer Centre (Hamilton), and The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre (Ottawa). Pre-study sample size analysis suggests that 150 patients will be required to demonstrate a hazard ratio for death of 2.3 between patients with a high and low LSC17 score (\u03b1 = 0.05, power = 0.8). The survival for the high and low LSC17 score groups will be compared using the Cox proportional hazards model. Traditional risk stratification will also be tested within a Cox proportional hazards model. Phase 1 of the study has been completed and several key quality control measures have been created. Initial derivation and validation of the LSC17 score was performed using standard chemistry on the NanoString platform; for CLIA lab validation, the assay was transitioned to Elements\u00a9 chemistry, which does not require custom codeset manufacture by NanoString. The original AML reference cohort was retested using Elements\u00a9 chemistry to derive an absolute median threshold for prospective LSC17 score determination in individual patients. The lab validation process compared and found no difference in LSC17 scores between samples processed by Ficoll or collected in Paxgene for ease of processing. A standardised quality assurance (QA) process was completed to identify optimal sample requirements as well as specimen storage conditions, score stability during sample storage and turnaround time for testing. An algorithm has been created using the laboratory information system to allow standardised and rapid calculation of the LSC17 score from NanoString nCounter output data. The LSC17 score can be tested on peripheral blood or bone marrow, although bone marrow samples are preferred for patients with very low peripheral blast counts. Samples are ideally stored in RNA Paxgene tubes for RNA stability and to maximize RNA yield. The prospective phase of the study (Phase 2) opened in April 2018 and as of June 2019, 233 patients have been enrolled, of which 120 received induction chemotherapy. 54 patients were excluded due to an alternative diagnosis or failed QA. The remaining patients had non-intensive therapy based on patient choice. Standard prognostic markers including cytogenetics, molecular studies and targeted sequencing using a 49-gene AML panel are performed in parallel to the LSC17 score. Treatment was administered according to physician preference, based on patient history and results of standard prognostic assays, when available. The study continues to recruit and is open to collaborations in other centres. Disclosures Ng: Celgene: Research Funding.
