    "abstract_text": "Objective: To explore the possible immune pathophysiology of CD4 + T regulatory (CD4 + Treg) in acquired aplastic anemia (AA). Methods: According to the markers on membrane, cytokines, and effective mechanisms of CD4 + Treg, the levels of CD4 + CD25 + Treg,CD4 + CTLA-4 + Treg,CD4 + ICOS + Treg,CD4 + PD-1 + Treg,CD3 + CD8 \u2212 IL-10 + Treg,CD3 + CD8 \u2212 TGF-\u03b21 + Treg,CD3 + CD8 \u2212 IL-Treg in the bone marrow of 23 cases with AA at active phase, 10cases with AA at recovery phase, 15 normal controls, were measured, and the relationship between CD4 + Treg and priming immune factor-CD28 or effective immune factor-IFN-\u03b3 were also evaluated respectively. Results: [circ1]In the group of AA at active phase, at recovery phase, and normal controls, CD4 + CD25 + Treg: (3.36\u00b12.05)%, (3.49\u00b11.71)%, (2.40\u00b10.77)%, CD4 + CTLA-4 + Treg: (1.43\u00b10.67)%, (3.46\u00b12.26)%, (2.45\u00b11.30)%, CD4 + ICOS + Treg: (2.04\u00b11.79)%, (2.95\u00b12.23)%, (2.37\u00b11.68)%, CD4 + PD-1 + Treg: (1.40\u00b11.32)%, (2.34\u00b10.87)%, (2.07\u00b11.64)%, CD3 + CD8 \u2212 IL-10 + Treg: (2.14\u00b11.19)%, (2.37\u00b11.20)%, (2.04\u00b11.25)%, CD3 + CD8 \u2212 TGF-\u03b21 + Treg: (1.83\u00b10.99)%, (1.52\u00b10.73)%, (2.15\u00b11.17)%, CD3 + CD8 \u2212 IL-4 + Treg: (2.46\u00b11.65)%, (2.53\u00b11.61)%, (1.99\u00b11.27)%; costimulatory of CD3 + CD4 + CD28 + was: (39.84\u00b110.89)%, (22.72\u00b19.08)%, 31.40\u00b110.83)%, the Th1cells CD3 + CD8 \u2212 IFN-\u03b3 + were: (11.13\u00b14.96)%, (5.39\u00b14.29)%, (4.21\u00b12.11)%. [circ2] Contrast to normal controls, while CD4 + CTLA-4 + Treg of AA at active phase deceased markedly ( p=<0.01 ), levels of other CD4 + Treg which marked by membrane moleculars or cytokines: CD4 + CD25 + Treg, CD4 + PD-1 + Treg, CD4 + ICOS + Treg, CD3 + CD8 \u2212 IL-10 + Treg, CD3 + CD8 \u2212 TGF-\u03b21 + Treg, CD3 + CD8 \u2212 IL-4 + Treg did not change significantly ( p>0.05 ); [circ3] Contrast to normal controls, the ratio of membrane costimulatory of CD28/ICOS CD28/CTLA-4, CD28/PD-1 were all increased significantly ( p<0.05 ) in AA at active phase; the ratio of cytokines in cell plasma of IFN-\u03b3 + IL-4, IFN-\u03b3/TGF-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3/IL-10, were also increased significantly ( p<0.05 ). Conclusion: [circ1] In AA, the positive regulatory costimulatory increased while the negative regulatory costimulatory did not change or decreased, which shifted the immune balance to intensification. [circ2] Not only at priming stage but also at effective stage, the immune strengthened factors were higher than attenuated factors in AA."
