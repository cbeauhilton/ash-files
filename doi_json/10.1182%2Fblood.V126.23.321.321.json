    "abstract_text": "Introduction: ASP2215 is a highly selective inhibitor of AXL and FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) receptors. ASP2215 is active against both FLT3 internal tandem duplication [ITD] and D835 mutations. Prior analyses of an open-label, dose-escalation/dose-expansion study in subjects with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) show ASP2215 was well tolerated from 20-300 mg and associated with antileukemic activity in FLT3 mutation-positive (FLT3+) patients at \u226580 mg with minimal activity observed in wild-type FLT3 subjects. Here we describe the tolerability and potent activity of ASP2215 in a large cohort of FLT3+ patients. Methods: Patients (\u226518 years) with R/R AML were assigned to treatment in dose-escalation cohorts or were randomized to an open dose level in the dose-expansion cohorts. Although FLT3 mutation was not an inclusion criterion, each expanded dose level enrolled \u226510 FLT3+ subjects; 120 mg and 200 mg dose levels were further expanded with \u226540 FLT3+ subjects. Tolerability was assessed by adverse event (AE) monitoring. Response assessment was based on modified Cheson criteria and duration of response and overall survival were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Results: As of June 19, 2015,215 patients with a median age of 61 yr (range: 21-90) had received \u22651 dose of ASP2215 (safety population). Across the safety population, 65% of subjects received \u22652 prior lines of AML therapy, 29% had a hematopoietic stem cell transplant prior to ASP2215 treatment, and 23% had prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. Approximately 73% of patients were FLT3+, of which 137 had FLT3-ITD mutation, 7 were FLT3-D835+, and 9 had both FLT3-ITD and D835. Treatment-related AEs of all Grades, reported in \u226510% of the safety population were diarrhea (16%), fatigue (13%), and increased AST (11%); <2% of subjects reported a Grade \u22653 QTc prolongation. Activity was assessed in the 133 FLT3+ patients treated with ASP2215 \u226580 mg. Overall response rate (ORR; composite complete [CRc] plus partial remission [PR]) for all FLT3+ subjects was 55% (Table). Median overall survival for FLT3+ patients receiving ASP2215 \u226580 mg was ~29 weeks (95% CI: 22-32) and was similar for patients who achieved CRc or PR (Figure). Treatment with \u226580 mg ASP2215 was associated with an ORR of 60% in FLT3-ITD subjects; ORR for the other FLT3 populations was 29% (Table). No difference was observed in median ORR of ASP2215 (\u226580 mg) in TKI-na\u00efve patients (55%) and patients with prior TKI treatment (55%). Conclusions: ASP2215, a novel AXL/FLT3 TKI, was well tolerated in subjects with R/R AML and demonstrated a strong antileukemic activity in FLT3+ subjects. Importantly, the ASP2215 response rate in these FLT3+ patients was independent of prior TKI treatment. Even in this heavily pretreated population, the survival of R/R FLT3+ AML patients who received \u226580 mg ASP2215 was longer than prior reports of cytotoxic chemotherapy or other FLT3 inhibitors.
