    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1825 Poster Board I-851 Purpose Recent advances in understanding of the molecular alterations that occur at the genetic and epigenetic levels in Multiple Myeloma (MM) have led to major leaps in identifying molecular pathways that regulate progression and resistance to therapeutic agents. However, despite great scientific advances at the genomic level, studies to identify signaling pathways deregulated at the functional proteomic level in MM are limited. We have previously demonstrated that Citron Rho Interacting Kinase (CRIK) is overexpressed in primary multiple myeloma (MM) cells, as compared to the normal plasma cell counterpart, using an antibody-based protein microarray technique. We therefore sought to investigate the functional role of CRIK in MM cells. Methods We determined the protein expression level of 512 polypeptides in 12 samples of newly diagnosed patients with MM using high-throughput proteomic analysis with antibody-based protein microarray. Primary CD138+ sorted MM cells were obtained from the bone marrow of patients after informed consent. MM.1S, RPMI8226, and INA6 MM cell lines were used in this study. Protein expression has been studied by immunoblotting. Gene expression analysis has been assessed using the Affymetrix U133A platform. Lentivirus was used to knockdown CRIK in MM cell lines (MM.1S, RPMI8226, INA6). DNA synthesis, cell survival, cell cycle profiling and apoptosis were assessed by thymidine uptake, MTT, PI and Annexin/PI staining and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. Results Overexpression of CRIK has been confirmed in primary CD138+ tumor cells isolated from bone marrow of 12 patients with MM, as compared to normal plasma cells obtained from healthy donors. We found that CRIK-knockdown exerted an anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effect only in IL-6-dependent MM cell line INA6; in contrast, no effect on proliferation and survival was observed in MM1.S and RPMI8226. Indeed, INA6 CRIK-knockdown cells were characterized by a reduction in the proliferation rate, associated with decreased S-phase and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Moreover, induction of cytotoxicity was also demonstrated in CRIK knockdown cells compared to scramble probe transfected or non-transfected cells. We also showed that CRIK knockdown led to cytokinesis in INA6, indicating a possible mechanism for inhibition of proliferation of these cells. We next correlated CRIK gene expression level (CIT) with prognosis using previously published gene expression datasets and found that CRIK correlated with poor prognosis. Conclusion In this study, we show that MM cells express a high level of CRIK, and that inhibition of this protein leads to significant inhibition of proliferation and survival of IL-6 dependent MM cells. Moreover, CRIK protein expression correlated with poor survival in patients with MM.
