    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3122 Poster Board III-59 Objective The Registry of Haematological Malignancies (HM) has been established on January 1 st , 1980 in the department of Co\u0302te d'Or (pop 500 000 inhabitants). It was the first specialized registry in haematology in the world. During the course of 25 years (1980-2004), 5026 cases of HM were recorded including 1553 Myeloid malignancies (MM) in which entities not initially considered as malignant were taken in account such as Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and some Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). This allow us to present trends in incidence and survival of myeloid malignancies by entities since 1980. Method MM diagnosed in the population between 01/01/1980 and 31/12/2004 were registered. They were coded according to ICD-O-3 and following the principles of the 2001 WHO classification i.e. new threshold of definition of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). World population standardized incidence rate were calculated by sex, age, by urban /rural repartition and by period of time. Five-year, 10-y, 15-y and 20-y relative survival was calculated using Este\u0300ve's method and based on vital status updated at the end of 2007. Results Incidence rate for whole MM were 3.73/100 000/y in men and 2.74 in women. They were 2.82 for AML, 3.73 in MPN and 2.83 in MDS. Sex ratio was 1.5/1 as a whole and urban/ratio was always close to 2, data being statistically significant for numerous entities. Incidence rates increase with age until 75y-o for AML and 80y-o for MPN and then decreased except for MDS in which incidence continue to increase. Along the period, only incidence of MDS increases significantly with an annual medium rate of 3% (2.7 in men and 3.3 in women). In MPN, a significant increase was observed only for women (2%). Within AML, surprisingly a significant increase was found for AML with recurrent cytogenetic abnormality in men (8.03%). 15-years relative survival was the best for MPN (46%), being significantly better in women (59% vs 31%), in which Essential Thrombocythemia was the best (74%). On the contrary, the worst 15-y survival was for was for MDS (9%). Within AML, the best survival was found for AML recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities (15-y: 54%) compare to other categories (4-8%). Survival has not increased along the period, has increased significantly in MPN. In AML, 10-y survival has increased until 1999 to reach 39% but has decreased for the 2000-2004 period (8-y: 11%). Conclusion Analysis of the largest epidemiologic database on HM allow to produce information such as a significant increase of incidence of MDS in which survival remained very poor in both sex, a good survival of MPN compared to other categories and a worrying decreased of survival of AML in the more recent period.
