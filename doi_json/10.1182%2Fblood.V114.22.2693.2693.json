    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2693 Poster Board II-669 Background: NPI-0052 is a proteasome inhibitor with a novel bicyclic structure (other proteasome inhibitors in clinical use are peptide based). Preclinical studies indicate rapid, broad and prolonged inhibition of all 3 catalytic sites of the proteasome, and subsequently unique proteasome inhibition, signal transduction, toxicology and efficacy profiles. Taken together these suggest the potential for improvements in therapeutic ratio and activity in hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. Materials and Methods: Patients with solid tumor, lymphoma, leukemia or myeloma diagnoses without standard treatment options have been treated with IV NPI-0052 on one of two arms (weekly or twice weekly) in this 3+3 design dose escalation study. This is followed by 10 patient Recommended Phase 2 dose Cohorts of patients with lymphomas, CLL and myeloma respectively. Proteasome inhibition (pharmacodynamics) and pharmacokinetics are also assayed in whole blood, and proteasome inhibition in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Results: 44 patients have been treated with NPI-0052 at doses ranging from 0.075 mg/m 2 to 0.9 mg/m 2 . Common adverse events include fatigue, parosmia/dysgeusia, transient peri-infusion site pain, lymphopenia, headaches, dizziness / unsteady gait, closed-eye visuals, cognitive changes. Incidence and grade of these events correlate with dose, being quite tolerable at the MTD of 0.7 mg/m 2 on the weekly dosing arm. An MTD has not yet been determined for the twice weekly dosing arm. Pharmacokinetic data has demonstrated a rapid elimination half-life (<20 minutes) and relatively large volume of distribution. Assessment of proteasome inhibition has demonstrated increasing inhibition of chymotrypsin-like activity of up to 88% Day 1 and 100% Day 15. Inhibition of caspase-like and trypsin-like activity of up to 52% and 71% respectively has also been seen. Inhibition remains between doses in whole blood (principally RBC), but recovers between doses in PBMC. Clinical benefit, including stable disease, regression or response, was reported in patients with mantle cell lymphoma, myeloma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, sarcoma, prostate carcinoma and melanoma. Conclusions: NPI-0052 produces dose-dependent pharmacologic effects through the predicted efficacious range, while producing a toxicity profile that is dissimilar to what is reported with other proteasome inhibitors (notably deficient in peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) in spite of producing equal or greater proteasome inhibition. These data indicate a broad range of potential uses, and led to additional studies in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors alone and in combination.
