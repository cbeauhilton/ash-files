    "abstract_text": "The goal of this study was to prove the significance of an early evaluation of leukemic blast reduction based on cytological examination of bone marrow aspirates obtained on day 6 of remission induction treatment. Patients. 90 adult AML patients aged 18\u201360 (median 47) registered to the PALG prospective trial evaluating the efficacy of 3 remission induction protocols: DAF: daunorubicine (DNR) 60 mg/m2/d iv, d 1\u20133; cytarabine (AraC) 200 mg/m2/d ci, d 1\u20137, and fludarabine 25 mg/m2 2h inf. iv d 1\u20135), DAC (like DAF but cladribin is used at 5 mg/m2 instead of fludarabine) and the standard DA 3+7 regimen. Bone marrow aspirates were performed before the treatment and on the 6-th day of the first remission induction course, and the MGG stained marrow smears were evaluated at each centre by two experienced hematologists. Results. Based on the proportion of blasts in bone marrow specimen on day 6 patients were arranged into 2 groups: \u201cresponders\u201dwith \u22645% of blasts (n=59) and \u201cnon responders\u201d with >5% of myeloblasts in bone marrow (n=31). The complete remission rate (CR) in the first group equalling 89% (51/59) was significantly higher in comparison to that obtained in the second group 29%(9/31), p=0,008. The probability of overall survival (OS) was also higher in the group of \u201cresponders\u201d if compared to \u201cnon responders\u201d; 65% versus 45% respectively, p=0,009. In multivariate analysis including bone marrow examination, cytogenetic risk group, age, leukocyte count at diagnosis and the induction arm only the persistence of leukemic blasts >5% in bone marrow specimen on 6-th day of induction was associated with higher risk of not achieving CR (HR = 52,6; p=0,00002), and with shorter OS (HR=3,13; p=0,02). Conclusion. This prospective, multicenter study demonstrates that a simple and commonly accessible evaluation of the leukemic blasts reduction in bone marrow smear on the 6-th day of remission induction treatment is a reliable and independent predictor for achieving CR and for overall survival. This offers a decision point for an early modification of the treatment strategy."
