    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2144 Introduction: Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is a cell-based immunomodulatory therapy involving the separation of autologous mononuclear cell fraction followed by ex-vivo administration of 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and UVA irradiation before reinfusion. ECP is efficient for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, multiple skin disorders, autoimmune diseases, solid organ transplant rejection and graft versus host disease (GVDH). During UVA irradiation phase, 8-MOP binds covalently to leukocytes' DNA leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These pre-apoptotic leukocytes are reintroduced into the peripheral circulation where they are phagocytosed by immature dendritic cells, which play a crucial role in the induction of peripheral tolerance through the induction of T regulatory cells subsets, production of anti-inflamatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-b and the deletion of effector antigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells into lymph nodes. Our aim in the present work was to compare the therapeutic effectiveness of 8-MOP with other four new compounds (BB01 to BB04). Methods: Mononuclear cells (MNC) were isolated by ficoll density gradient, incubated with increasing concentrations of 8-MOP, BB01, BB02, BB03 and BB04 and irradiated with UVA light (2 J/cm 2 ). MNC apoptosis percentage was measured by flow cytometry (Annexin-V and 7-AAD staining) after 48h of culture at 37\u00b0C. Mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) with either myeloid immature (iDC) or mature dendritic cells (mDC) and UVA irradiated MNC treated with the different compounds were performed. After 48h of MLC CCL21-stimulated migration of iDC and mDC was studied. In other assays, after 6 days of MLC the proliferation of treated MNC (BrdU incorporation) and the production of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed. Results: After incubation of MNC with the different compounds + UVA there was a significative increase of apoptosis percentage using BB02 (from 50 ng/ml, p<0.001) and BB01 (from 200 ng/ml, p<0.001) over that achieved using 8-MOP, while BB03 and BB04 induced significatively less apoptosis. Furthermore, in comparation with 8-MOP, there was a significant upregulation of the CCL21-promoted migration of iDC (p<0.05) and lower migration of mDC (p<0.001) respectively, when these DC were co-cultured with MNC treated with BB02 + UVA. On the other hand, MNC proliferation achieved after MLC with allogeneic iDC or mDC was partially inhibited after treatment with all tested compounds + UVA. These inhibition was higher using BB02 and BB01, although the difference was no statistically significant when compared to 8-MOP. In addition, in MLC using treated MNC and stimulator iDC there was a reduction in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-g, IL-6 and IL-17A) and an increase of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-b that was higher using BB02 + UVA. Conclusions: Compounds BB01 and specially BB02 were more efficient than 8-MOP in the induction of apoptosis and the upregulation of chemokine-promoted migration of iDC. They were also better in the inhibition of the proliferation of MNC stimulated by iDC and mDC, and in the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokine production. This higher in vitro activity might be relevant to increase the therapeutic potential of ECP.
