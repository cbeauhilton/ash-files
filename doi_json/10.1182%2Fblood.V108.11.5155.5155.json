    "abstract_text": "NK cells are characterized by absent CD3 and expression of CD56. CD56 NK cells are classified into CD56 dim (90%) that are primarily cytotoxic, and CD56 bright that secrete cytokines (Kaplan et al PNAS 1998; Shankaran et al Nature 2001). NK subsets carry out their respective functions based on their repertoire of NK receptors (NKRs), both activating and inhibiting (Moretta et al Annu Rev Immunol 2001). PB CD56 dim cells express high concentrations of killer-cell immunoglobulin receptors (KIR) and C-type lectin receptors. PB CD56 bright NK cells have increased expression of C-type lectin receptors, but have low expression of the KIRs (Nagler J. Immunol 1989). CD16 (the Fc\u03b3 receptor III or Fc\u03b3RIII) which is responsible for binding to antibody-coated targets and initiating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) has increased expression in CD56 dim vs CD56 bright NK cells (Leibson et al Immunity 1997). While the characterization and function of PB NK subsets and NKR expression are well described, there is little information regarding CB NK subsets and NKRs. We previously demonstrated a significant increase in CB NK NKR expression in ex-vivo engineered CB MNC following 48 hours of induction with IL-2, IL-7, IL-12, and Anti-CD3 (Ayello/Cairo et al BBMT 2006). In this study, we compared PB vs. CB NK subsets and NKR expression. PB and CB cells were positively selected for CD56 + using CD56 magnetic beads (Miltenyi, Aubrun, CA). CD56 + cells were sorted into CD3 \u2212 /CD56 bright and CD3 \u2212 /CD56 dim subsets by FACS sorter and NK receptor expression (CD16, CD158a {KIR2DL1} CD158a, h {KIR2DL1 and KIR2DS1}, CD158b {KIR2DL2}, CD161, NKG2A, NKG2C, NKG2D, Nkp44, NKp46, Becton Dickinson, Mountainview, CA,) of each subset was analyzed by flow cytometry. CD56 + selection yielded >89% purity (PB-96%, CB-89%). There was no statistical difference (mean \u00b1 SEM) in the receptor expression between the CB CD56 bright and PB CD56 bright and also between the CB CD56 dim and PB CD56 dim . However, PB CD56 bright vs. PB CD56 dim had increased expression of NKG2A (93.28 \u00b1 2.83 vs. 66.64 \u00b17.74, p< 0.015), NKG2C (62.11 \u00b111.79 vs. 8.08 \u00b1 2.98, p< 0.12), NKp44 (61.52 \u00b110.35 vs. 3.79 \u00b1 2.32, p< 0.005) and NKp46 (92.53 \u00b13.31 vs. 64.66 \u00b1 12.34, p< 0.05). PB CD56 dim had increased expression of CD16 (93.30 \u00b1 2.71 vs. 61.15 \u00b1 11.79, p< 0.07) compared to PB CD56 bright . The CB CD56 dim compared to CB CD56 bright has increased CD16 expression (85.06 \u00b1 6.75 vs. 40.91 \u00b1 5.74, p< 0.004) only. The PB CD56 bright only differed from the CB CD56 dim with respect to NKp44 (p< 0.021). The CB CD56 bright differed from the PB CD56 dim with respect to KIR2DL1 (p< 0.026), CD161 (p < 0.05), NKG2A (p < 0.025), and NKG2C (p < 0.05). In conclusion, there does appear to be a definite difference in NKR expression in PB CD56 bright vs. PB CD56 dim . However, PB vs. CB CD56 dim and PB vs. CB CD56 bright did not have any statistically significant NKR expression differences suggesting that the subsets have similar phenotypes in their respective cell source. Based on these results, we postulate that the CB CD56 dim subset might reflect an intermediary step in development transitioning from CB CD56 bright to PB CD56 dim .",
