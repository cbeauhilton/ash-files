    "abstract_text": "Background Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas with poor overall survival rates. The genetics of PTCLs are poorly understood. We have described t(6;14)(p25.3;q11.2) translocations in PTCLs involving the T-cell receptor-alpha ( TRA@ ) and interferon regulatory factor-4 ( IRF4 ) genes and overexpressing IRF4 protein (also called MUM1). IRF4/MUM1 is a lymphoid transcription factor involved in differentiation and growth, the expression of which is tightly regulated in normal T cells. However, nearly half of PTCLs constitutively express IRF4/MUM1 and this expression is associated with adverse overall survival in several PTCL subtypes. Because IRF4/TRA@ translocations are rare among PTCLs (<1%), we investigated the presence of other genetic abnormalities of IRF4 in PTCLs and examined their association with IRF4/MUM1 protein expression. Methods Studies were performed on paraffin tissue sections of PTCL specimens diagnosed by standard WHO criteria. IRF4/MUM1 immunohistochemical staining (IHC) was performed using the MUM1p antibody and considered positive if nuclear staining was present in >30% of tumor cell nuclei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using breakapart probes constructed from bacterial artificial chromosome DNA that hybridized to loci flanking the IRF4 locus on 6p25.3. Cases with 3 or more fusion signals were considered to have extra copies of the IRF4 gene. In a subset of cases, PCR and Sanger sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from frozen PTCL tumor tissue with primer sets that amplified exons 1 to 10 of the IRF4 gene. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test or t test. Results PTCLs from 277 patients (175 M:102 F; median age, 61 y) were examined by both IHC and FISH. The subtype distribution was: PTCL, not otherwise specified (NOS), 93; anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), 89; angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), 27; cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), 43; and cytotoxic PTCL, 25. IRF4/MUM1 was positive in 116 cases (42%). Extra copies of IRF4 were identified in 18 PTCLs (7%), 83% of which were IRF4/MUM1 protein-positive. In contrast, 39% of cases without extra copies of IRF4 were IRF4/MUM1 protein-positive (p=0.0002). The mean percentage of tumor cells with IRF4/MUM1 staining was 69% in cases with extra copies of IRF4 , compared to 30% in cases without extra copies (p=0.0001). Extra copies of IRF4 were seen in 13% of ALCLs, 4% each of PTCLs, NOS and cytotoxic PTCLs, 2% of CTCLs, and 0% of AITLs (p=0.02). Two IRF4/MUM1-positive cases had an IRF4/TRA@ translocation (1%). We selected 30 IRF4/MUM1-positive PTCLs for Sanger sequencing. In this subset, we identified a previously undescribed non-synonymous variant in exon 5 (S309R) in 1 case (3%) without an extra copy of IRF4 . Conclusions Extra copies of IRF4 are seen in \u223c7% of PTCLs, are significantly associated with IRF4/MUM1 expression, and are preferentially observed in ALCLs. Both IRF4/TRA@ translocations and IRF4 mutations are rare in PTCLs. These data suggest that genetic abnormalities of the IRF4 gene \u2013 specifically extra copies of IRF4 \u2013 may contribute to IRF4/MUM1 expression in some PTCLs. Since IRF4/MUM1 expression is seen in \u223c42% of PTCLs, these data also imply the existence of other regulatory mechanisms. Characterizing these mechanisms may be important clinically, since IRF4/MUM1 has been proposed as a therapeutic target in human cancers but drugs that directly inhibit its function are currently not available.
