    "abstract_text": "Background VOD/SOS is an unpredictable, potentially life-threatening complication of conditioning regimens for HSCT or chemotherapy without HSCT, and has been reported to have an overall incidence of 13.7% post-HSCT. VOD/SOS with multi-organ dysfunction (MOD) may be associated with >80% mortality. In the United States, defibrotide is approved for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with hepatic VOD/SOS and renal or pulmonary dysfunction following HSCT, and it is approved in the European Union for treatment of severe hepatic VOD/SOS after HSCT. Here, a pooled analysis compared overall survival among groups based on severity of VOD/SOS, including those with MOD and those who were ventilator- or dialysis-dependent. Methods This analysis included data from a phase 2 trial, a phase 3 trial, and an expanded-access (T-IND) program. The phase 2 dose-finding trial (defibrotide 25 mg/kg/day [n=75] and 40 mg/kg/day [n=74]) in patients with VOD/SOS and MOD found no significant differences in efficacy or safety between doses. The phase 3 treatment trial compared the efficacy and safety of defibrotide at 25 mg/kg/day in patients with VOD/SOS with MOD (n=102) to those of patients from a historical control group (n=32) that met the study's inclusion criteria but were treated at the study's centers prior to the availability of defibrotide at that institution. The T-IND study provided access to 25 mg/kg/day defibrotide prior to regulatory approval in the United States and generated prospective data on outcomes in 1154 VOD/SOS patients with and without MOD following HSCT or chemotherapy without HSCT. Data from patients with VOD/SOS and MOD (renal or pulmonary dysfunction, Table 1 ) following HSCT were pooled to examine Day +100 survival in relationship to MOD severity, with dialysis and ventilator dependence at baseline indicating the most severe dysfunction. Results The total pooled population from the 3 trials was 763 patients with VOD/SOS and MOD post-HSCT (phase 2 trial, n=149; phase 3 trial, n=102; T-IND study, n=512). Of these, 219 (28.7%) patients had ventilator dependence (irrespective of dialysis dependence) and 172 (22.5%) patients had dialysis dependence (irrespective of ventilator dependence; Table 2 ). A total of 275 patients had either dependence (ie, at least one) and 116 had both dependencies. The 32 historical control patients from the phase 3 trial were analyzed separately ( Table 2 ). Median age in the pooled treatment population was 17 (range, 0-72) years and 18 (range, 1-57) in the historical controls. Kaplan-Meier Day +100 estimated survival rate was 51.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47.3%-56.3%) in patients with neither dependence (n=488). In the 275 patients with either dependence, Kaplan-Meier Day +100 estimated survival was 36.3% (95% CI, 30.6%-42.0%); and in patients with both dependencies (n=116), Kaplan-Meier Day +100 estimated survival was 29.1% (95% CI, 21.1%-37.6%). In the 32-patient historical control group, Kaplan-Meier Day +100 estimated survival rates were: 28.0% (95% CI, 12.4%-46.0%) in patients with neither dependence (n=25) and 14.3% (95% CI, 0.7%-46.5%) in patients with at least one dependence (n=7). One patient in this group had both ventilator and dialysis dependence and died prior to Day +100. In the pooled group of treated patients, 627 (82.2%) had at least one adverse event, with 196 (25.7%) having a treatment-related adverse event (TRAE). The most common TRAEs (>2% of the population) were: hypotension, 4.1%; gastrointestinal hemorrhage, 3.9%; pulmonary hemorrhage, 3.9%; epistaxis, 2.8%; and pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage, 2.0%. Hemorrhagic events were reported in 40.6%; hypotension in 22.7%. All 32 historical patients had at least one adverse event. Conclusions Results from this pooled analysis of patients with VOD/SOS with MOD from 3 defibrotide studies suggest that survival outcomes are better when the treated patients have less severe forms of MOD (51.9%) vs patients with ventilator and/or dialysis dependence (36.3%) vs both ventilator plus dialysis dependence (29.1%). In the small historical control population, Day +100 survival in patients without ventilator or dialysis dependence was 28.0% and was 14.3% in patients with ventilator and/or dialysis dependence.
