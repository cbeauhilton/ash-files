    "abstract_text": "Background and aims Several oncogenic aberrations of receptor tyrosine kinases occur in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). Here, we describe a subgroup of pediatric patients lacking common chromosomal aberrations but with high gene expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha ( PDGFRA ). Oncogenic fusions involving the tyrosine kinase domain of PDGFRA are recurrent in eosinophilic leukemia and are responsive to kinase inhibitors (Cools et al. N Engl J Med 2003). One case with a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion was reported in adult BCP-ALL (Roberts et al. J Clin Oncol 2016). Therefore, we tested for genomic aberrations underlying the overexpression of PDGFRA and evaluated the inhibition of PDGFR\u03b1 as treatment option in pediatric BCP-ALL. Methods Expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 arrays. BCR-ABL1 -like cases were identified using the 110 probe set expression signature (Den Boer et al. Lancet Oncol 2009). High PDGFRA was defined as log2 expression of probe set 203131_at >5.9. FISH was performed using Cytocell FIP1L1/CHIC2/PDGFRA probes. Targeted locus amplification (de Vree et al. Nat Biotechnol 2014) was performed using custom-designed primers. Cells were treated for 10 minutes with 10 ng/mL PDGF-BB with or without 10 \u00b5M imatinib or 1 \u00b5M CP673451 and analyzed by western blot. Cell viability after 4 day exposure to imatinib (0.2\u00b5M - 1.6\u00b5M - 12.5\u00b5M) or CP673451 (0.02\u00b5M - 0.16\u00b5M - 1.25\u00b5M) was assessed by flow cytometry. Results Gene expression analysis of 654 pediatric ALL cases identified high expression of PDGFRA in 26 of 574 BCP-ALL cases (4.5%). High PDGFRA expression was exclusively found in cases belonging to the B-other (n=22) or BCR-ABL1 -like (n=4) subtypes, and not present in ETV6-RUNX1 , high hyperdiploid, TCF3-PBX1 , BCR-ABL1 and KMT2A -rearranged BCP-ALL subtypes or T-ALL. PDGFRA expression was confirmed by RT-qPCR, and also found in the BCP-ALL cell line Nalm6. Using RT-PCR we did not detect any of the six reported PDGFRA fusions, which involve FIP1L1, STRN, BCR, CDK5RAP2, ETV6, and KIF5B , nor did we detect novel structural aberrations affecting PDGFRA by FISH. We studied the PDGFRA locus at high resolution by targeted locus amplification. Following DNA cross-linking, digestion, and proximity-based re-ligation, targeted amplification was performed from viewpoints in intron 2 and exon 15 of PDGFRA . In the eosinophilic cell line EOL1 we confirmed an interstitial deletion on chromosome 4 which rearranges FIP1L1 intron 12 to PDGFRA exon 12. The results obtained from Nalm6 and primary BCP-ALL samples with high PDGFRA expression did not indicate genomic aberrations of PDGFRA . ERG deletions were present in 10 of 16 PDGFRA -high cases (63%), compared with 0% in PDGFRA -low BCP-ALL cases (n=71; p<0.001). Vice versa, all ERG -deleted cases expressed high levels of PDGFRA . Recently, a novel BCP-ALL subtype was described with rearrangements of the transcription factor DUX4 and deletion of ERG (Lilljebj\u00f6rn et al. Nat Commun 2016; Yasuda et al. Nat Genet 2016; Zhang et al. Nat Genet 2016). Furthermore, the high PDGFRA -expressing cell line Nalm6 carries a DUX4 rearrangement (Yasuda et al. Nat Genet 2016) and PDGFRA is highly expressed in DUX4 BCP-ALL and its transcription start site directly bound by DUX4 (Zhang et al. Nat Genet 2016). Therefore, we regard it as highly likely that the PDGFRA -high cases represent this novel DUX4- rearranged subtype. Because transcription factors are difficult to target with small molecule inhibitors, PDGFR\u03b1 inhibition could represent a treatment option. Exposure to the PDGFR inhibitors imatinib and CP673451 reduced phosphorylation of PDGFR\u03b1 in Nalm6 and primary BCP-ALL cells. However, e x vivo drug exposure revealed no cytotoxic effect of the PDGFR inhibitors on PDGFRA -high BCP-ALL cells, either in the presence or absence of the ligand PDGF-BB. Interestingly, we found a marked ex vivo sensitivity towards prednisolone in PDGFRA -high cases, in line with the good prognosis reported for ERG -deleted/ DUX4 -rearranged BCP-ALL. Conclusions We found high PDGFRA expression, in the absence of genomic aberrations of the PDGFRA locus, in a subgroup of BCP-ALL patients with frequent ERG deletions. PDGFR inhibition caused abrogation of PDGFR\u03b1 phosphorylation but was not cytotoxic in PDGFRA -high expressing BCP-ALL cells. Therefore, high PDGFRA expression does not serve as effective therapeutic target in ERG -deleted BCP-ALL. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
