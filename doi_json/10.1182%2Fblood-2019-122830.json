    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND Outcomes for patients (pts) with primary CNS diffuse large B cell lymphoma (PCNSL) have improved over recent years, largely through optimisation of first-line methotrexate (MTX)-containing protocols and dose-intensive chemotherapy consolidation. However, 30-50% of pts experience refractory or relapsed (r/r) disease, which confers very poor outcomes and short survival. By contrast to systemic DLCBL, there is no accepted standard approach for r/r PCNSL. Thiotepa is an alkylating agent highly efficient at crossing the BBB and widely incorporated within high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT-ASCT) protocols for PCNSL, but has not undergone dose-finding studies nor been incorporated within salvage regimens for PCNSL. The TIER study investigates the safety and efficacy of adding thiotepa, in a dose-escalation design, to the Rituximab, Ifosphamide and Etoposide (R-IE) salvage regimen 1 . METHODS TIER is an open label, phase I/II UK NCRI TAP study for pts with r/r PCNSL, previously treated with a high-dose MTX-based regimen. In phase I, the RP2D of thiotepa within the TIER combination was established using a 3+3 design, with dose escalations of 30, 40 and 50mg/m 2 (dose level 2 (n=4), 3 (n=5) and 4 (n=27) respectively), given on day 5 of R-IE cycle 1 . The Phase II primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) after cycle 2 of TIER (C2) by centrally reviewed contrast-enhanced MRI 2 , on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. Further treatment and consolidation after the primary endpoint MRI was at the discretion of investigators. Key secondary end-points were 2-year PFS, EFS and OS. RESULTS Thirty-six pts were recruited from Jun 2015-Apr 2019 at 13 centres (characteristics: Table 1). The median number of prior lines was 2 (range 1-4) with 44% of patients deemed refractory to their previous line of therapy. During phase I (n=10) no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed up to and including 50mg/m 2 thiotepa, constituting the RP2D (n=27). 56 cycles of TIER were administered across both phases; 5 pts had >1 dose reductions. Median time between C1D1 and C2D1 was 24.7 days (range 22-38). Relative mean dose intensity of thiotepa, ifosphamide and etoposide was 71.8 (SD 44.9), 76.4 (SD 41.6), and 76.8 (SD 41.8) respectively. Further therapy after 2 cycles of TIER was delivered to 41.7% of pts (16.7% ASCT, 22.2% TIE, and 2.8% WBRT). The most common grade 3 / 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia and neutropenia (47.2 and 55.6% occurring in 15 and 18 pts respectively). 17 serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 12 pts, of which 4 were haematological. Of these, 13 were considered related to TIER. Commonly occurring non-haematological SAEs were respiratory tract infections (23.5%) and seizures (11.8%). At data lock, 10/27 pts had responded to treatment as assessed by local investigators (ORR 37%, CR rate 15%). 13 pts were non-evaluable (7 progressed prior to C2 scan, 2 withdrew consent, and 4 awaiting scans) and classed as non-responders. Following data lock, responses were reported for 3 further pts (2 by local investigators and 1 by central review), resulting in a provisional ORR of 13/27 (48%). For the ITT population, median OS time was 3.52 months (95% CI 2.50, 14.17), and median PFS 2.86 months (95%CI 2.34, 6.05) (Figure 1). 6 pts underwent ASCT consolidation after TIER, of whom 2 have relapsed. CONCLUSIONS This is an early analysis of data from the phase I/II TIER study for a heavily pre-treated group of r/r PCNSL; the first such dose-escalation study for this patient group. Phase I determined a RP2D of 50mg/m 2 of thiotepa incorporated in the R-IE regimen. There were no DLTs and toxicities, consistent with an intensive ifosphamide-based regimen. ORR was 10 pts (37%) with 3 further responses reported after data lock. If confirmed by central review, the primary endpoint of activity (ORR 40%) will have been reached. However, notwithstanding the response endpoint, most pts experienced very poor survival outcomes. These data describe the feasibility of TIER as a salvage regimen for r/r PCNSL but question the utility of this approach as a standard option, given the short PFS and OS times, except for the minority of pts who received ASCT . Biological and imaging sub studies are underway to identify predictors of outcome. In the modern era of effective first line immunochemotherapy approaches, pts with r/r PCNSL remain a major area of unmet need for whom novel experimental approaches are urgently required.
