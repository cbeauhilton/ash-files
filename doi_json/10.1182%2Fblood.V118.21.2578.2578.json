    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2578 Prognosis for patients (pts) with Ph+ ALL has improved significantly with the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Dasatinib is \u223c325 times more potent than imatinib, and has shown activity in pts with imatinib resistance or intolerance, both in CML and Ph+ ALL. From 9/2006, pts with relapsed Ph+ ALL or CML-LB received dasatinib 100 mg po daily for the first 14 days of each of 8 cycles of alternating hyperCVAD, and high-dose cytarabine with methotrexate. Patients in complete remission (CR) continued to receive maintenance with dasatinib 100 mg po daily, with vincristine and prednisone monthly for 2 years, followed by dasatinib indefinitely. All patients proceeded to an allogeneic stem cell transplant as soon as feasible. From 8/2009, dasatinib dose was modified to 100mg po daily for the first 14 days of the first cycle, then at 70mg po daily continuously. Pts also received Rituximab on Days 1 and 11 of each of the first 4 cycles of therapy. A total of 32 pts with relapsed Ph+ ALL (n=18) or CML-LB (n=14) have received a median of 3 cycles (range=1\u20138 cycles). Twenty-three pts were treated on the initial regimen and 9 pts on the modified version. Median age was 50 yrs (range 21\u201377). Median number of prior regimens was 1 (range=1\u20132): hyperCVAD plus imatinib (n=10, 3 had transplant in first CR), other combination chemotherapy (n=12), monotherapy with TKI other than dasatinib (n=8), and investigational agents (n=2). Median WBC at start of treatment was 9.8 \u00d7 10 9 /L (range=0.3\u2013295.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L). Median bone marrow blast percentage was 72% (range 0\u201397%; 1 pt had solitary CNS relapse). Eight (25%) patients had CNS involvement. Pre-treatment ABL mutations noted in 9 pts included: T315I(n=4), Y253F(n=1), Y253H(n=4), F359V(n=1), E459K(n=1), E255K(n=1), F317L(n=3), M351T(n=1). The overall response rate was 94%, with 23 pts (72%) achieving CR, and 7(22%) CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp). One pt died during induction. One pt had progressive disease. Twenty-five pts (83%) achieved complete cytogenetic remission after one cycle of therapy. Overall, 13 pts (43%) achieved complete molecular response, and 10 pts (33%) major molecular response (i.e., BCR-ABL/ABL <0.1%). Nine patients proceeded to allogeneic transplantation (ALL n=2, CML-LB n=7); one previously transplanted patient with ALL received donor lymphocyte infusion. Grade 3/4 toxicities included bleeding (GI, GU, and subdural hematomas), pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, infections, diarrhea, hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, elevated transaminases, and hyperbilirubinemia. The median follow-up for pts with CML-LB is 85 wks (range=12\u2013209 wks); 3-yr OS is 76% (median not reached); and, 82% remain in CR at 3 yrs [median CR duration (CRD) not reached]. For ALL pts, median follow-up was 139 wks (range=74\u2013175 wks); 3-yr OS is 33% (median=42 wks); and, 30% remain in CR at 3 yrs (median CRD=38 wks). The outcomes were the same for pts with CML-LB who did or did not receive a transplant (3-yr OS 83% for both cohorts). Among pts with ALL, outcome was better for those who underwent transplant (2 of 2 alive at 3 yrs as opposed to 4 of 16 without transplant). Conclusion: The combination of HyperCVAD regimen with dasatinib is effective in patients with relapsed Ph+ ALL and CML-LB.
