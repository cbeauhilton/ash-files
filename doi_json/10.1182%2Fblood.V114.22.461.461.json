    "abstract_text": "Abstract 461 Kru\u0308ppel-like factor 1 (KLF1) is essential for erythroid gene expression. Key molecular mechanisms modulated by this transacting factor have been elucidated at the b-globin locus. KLF1 has been associated with recruitment of SWI/SNF and RNA polymerase (PolII) complexes necessary for chromatin remodeling and gene transcription respectively, and for facilitating the apposition of the promoter with the far-upstream locus control region. More recently, KLF1 has been implicated in the regulation of an erythroid-specific gene program unlinked to the b-globin locus. Coordinated expression of these genes, including Alpha Hemoglobin-Stabilizing Protein (AHSP), a factor required for globin tetramer stability, and the red cell membrane protein Dematin, are critical for erythroid ontogeny. To compare the role(s) of KLF1 at these loci, we have used a unique 4-OH-Tamoxifen (4-OHT) inducible erythroid cell line, which facilitates the characterization of the temporal kinetics of KLF1-dependent erythroid gene activation. In preliminary experiments, we observed that KLF1 binding was maximal at the three loci within 60 minutes of 4-OHT induction. AHSP and dematin primary RNA transcripts followed similar kinetics, being maximal at 60-90 minutes post-induction. In contrast, b-globin gene transcription reached a plateau 4-6 hours post-induction. From these observations, we hypothesized that transcriptional activation at AHSP and dematin differs from that observed at the b-globin cluster. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed significant differences in chromatin remodeling at the three loci. At the b-globin promoter, we observed a small but statistically significant increase in DNaseI sensitivity, a measure of chromatin remodeling, with KLF1 binding. In contrast, we observed a complete loss of DNaseI resistance after KLF1 binding at the AHSP and dematin promoters. Consistent with these findings, we observed a five-fold reduction in histone H3 occupancy at the AHSP and dematin promoters, contrasting with no significant change in occupancy at the b-promoter. Importantly, these differences were not observed in regions 1-5 kb upstream of the promoters. These observations, coupled with similar differences in DNaseI hypersensitivity and histone occupancy in fetal liver erythroblasts from wild type and KLF1-null mice, suggest a profound difference in the mechanisms of chromatin remodeling at KLF1-dependent erythroid gene loci. To explore the potential mechanisms underlying these differences in chromatin accessibility, we examined the kinetics of recruitment of other transacting factors and co-activators to the three loci. We observed similar increases in binding of serine-5 phosphorylated PolII, GATA-1, and p45NF-E2 at the promoters. In contrast, binding of BRG1, the core ATPase component of the SWI/SNF complex differed between the b\u2013promoter and the other erythroid genes. Although BRG1 binding was co-incident with KLF1 binding to the b-gene, we observed significant albeit weak binding of this complex to the AHSP and Dematin promoters only after maximal gene transcription had occurred. Our results suggest that different KLF1 multiprotein complexes are recruited to remodel target gene promoters in vivo. Furthermore, we propose that KLF1's chromatin remodeling capabilities are not limited to the recruitment of the SWI/SNF complexes Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
