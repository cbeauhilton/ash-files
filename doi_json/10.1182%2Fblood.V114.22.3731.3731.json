    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3731 Poster Board III-667 Azacytidine is a potent demethylation agent and has been used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. Despite a role in reactivating epigenetically silenced tumor-suppressor genes, the mechanisms of action for azacytidine are not well understood. The relationships between the reactivation of tumor-suppressor genes and the significance for clinical responses also remain to be established. Azacytidine can incorporate into both RNA and DNA strands and may therefore act through multiple pathways. We therefore investigated the therapeutic potential of azacytidine in Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM), and characterized certain molecular changes associated with azacytidine. We found that azacytidine exhibited significant dose-dependent cytotoxicity against WM cell lines, and primary WM cells. Treatment of BCWM.1 WM cells with 2 uM of azacytidine rapidly induced cell cycle arrest at G1, and also induced apoptosis at 48 hours. Cleavage of caspase 3, 7, 8, 9 and PARP-1 suggested an involvement of mitochondrial and death receptor pathways in azacytidine-induced apoptosis. The BH3 proteins Puma and Bim, and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax were up-regulated while the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl remained unchanged after treatment with azacytidine. In addition, azacytidine did not induce Akt and NF\u03baB pathways. To further elucidate molecular changes associated with azacytidine treatment, we performed genome-wide microarray expression in BCWM.1 WM cells treated with azacytidine. We observed that the gene encoding fatty acid synthase (FASN) was among the most down-regulated of targets. FASN has been linked to tumor cell proliferation, and its expression was observed by us to be upregulated by microarray studies in WM patients, and further validated as a highly over-expressed target by quantitative RT-PCR analysis in WM patients versus healthy donors. Moreover, by these studies we show that knockdown of FASN by small interfering RNA resulted in growth arrest, and also induced apoptosis in BCWM.1 WM cells. Cerulenin, a specific inhibitor of FASN derived from a natural product, induced strong cytotoxicity against BCWM.1 and primary WM cells at 20 uM in 24 hours. In addition, a synergistic induction of apoptosis in BCWM.1 WM cells was observed in the presence of both azacytidine and cerulenin. The results of this study support an important role for FASN in azacytidine-induced cytotoxicity in WM cells, and highlight a novel mechanistic pathway for this agent, as well as a novel target for drug therapy in WM. A clinical study investigating the activity of azacytidine in WM is planned. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
