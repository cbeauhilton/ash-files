    "abstract_text": "Acute leukemia, especially acute myeloid leukemia (AML), occurs more frequently in the elderly population. Treatment outcomes for this condition have traditionally been poor and very few patients survive for prolonged periods following diagnosis. We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients sixty years of age and older diagnosed with acute leukemia at St. Paul\u2019s hospital, Vancouver, Canada, from June 1984 to July 2004. One hundred and three patients were diagnosed with acute leukemia [AML- 81; ALL- 15; ALN (acute leukemia not otherwise specified)- 7]. The median age was 72 (range 60\u201388) years. Fifty-seven (55%) and 46 (45%) patients had de novo and secondary leukemia, respectively. Sixteen patients (28%) had an unfavourable karyotype. Fifty-three patients (51%) received induction chemotherapy (treated) and 50 (49%) were provided with supportive care only (untreated). Treated patients were younger [67 years (60\u201379)] than untreated patients [76 years (61\u201388)], (p/= 80 years were treated (n=17). Of the treated patients, 33 (62%) achieved a complete remission (CR), 10 (19%) had resistant disease and 10 (19%) died from complications related to treatment. The median overall survival for the entire group was 103 (1\u20131229) days, and for treated versus untreated patients was 216 (1\u20131213) and 38 (2\u20131229) days, respectively (p=0.0021). The disease free survival in treated patients achieving a CR (n=33) was 262 days (9\u2013722). Less than 5% of patients were alive at 4 years from diagnosis. Univariate variables predictive of prolonged survival included receiving induction chemotherapy (p=0.0027), de novo as opposed to secondary leukemia (p=0.0420), and younger age, with a relative increase in death in older subgroups (60\u201369, 70\u201379, 80+), (p=0.0311). Induction chemotherapy was the only independent predictor of prolonged survival in multivariate analysis (p=0.0027). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of treated patients and treatment outcomes between 1984\u20131993 and 1994\u20132004. In conclusion, this single-institution series of 103 patients aged sixty years and older with acute leukemia, shows that the prognosis of this disease in older patients is extremely poor. Even though induction chemotherapy seems to prolong survival in patients who are fit to receive treatment, the prognosis remains grim and most patients ultimately die of leukemia, supporting a role for investigational regimens focusing solely on this age group. It is no longer appropriate to follow regimens that have remained largely unsuccessful and unchanged over 20 years."
