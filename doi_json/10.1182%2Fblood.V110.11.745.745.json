    "abstract_text": "Background: Smudge cells are ruptured CLL cells seen on blood smears of CLL patients. For over a century, smudge cells were thought to represent an artifact of slide preparation. We recently showed that smudge cell formation was inversely proportional to leukemic B cell vimentin content. Vimentin is a cytoskeletal protein critical for lymphocyte rigidity and migration; high vimentin content is related to poor prognosis in CLL. Concordantly, in an initial small cohort of patients from a single institution, we found that patients with a low (<30%) percentage of smudge cells on a blood smear have a shorter time to treatment ( Mayo Clin Proc.  2007 ; 82 : 449 \u201353 ). In the current study, we evaluated the impact of smudge cell percentage on prognosis of patients with CLL seen at member institutions of the CLL Research Consortium (CRC). Methods: Archived blood smears from untreated patients with CLL were evaluated for smudge levels. All blood smears were prepared manually in a standard fashion from blood obtained by CRC Tissue Core and stained with WrightGiemsa stain. Smudge cells were defined as broken cells with no intact cytoplasm and a disrupted nuclear membrane. A total of 200 lymphocytes and smudge cells were counted on each slide and the results were expressed as the percent smudge cells. The association between the percentage of smudge cells, prognostic factors (IgV H status, CD38, ZAP-70 and FISH) and time to initial therapy (TTT) was examined. Results: We calculated smudge cell percentage on blood smears obtained prior to treatment for 337 CLL patients. The median smudge cell percentage was 32 (range 2\u201395%). The percentage of smudge cells was lower in CD38 positive patients (mean 33% vs. 38% in CD38 negative patients, p=0.04). No difference in smudge cell percentage was observed based on IgV H gene mutation status or Zap70 expression. Smudge cell percentage as a continuous variable was associated with prolonged TTT, exponential coefficient 0.98, p=0.04. Using our previously published cutoff of 30% to stratify patients in low and high risk categories, the estimated median time to first therapy of patients with smudge cell percentage \u226430% (n=178) was 7.8 years versus not reached in patients in patients with > 30% (n=159) of smudge cells, p=0.0036, (Figure 1). Ten years from diagnosis, 62% of patients with \u226430% of smudge cells versus 39% of patients with >30% of smudge cells required therapy. In multivariate analysis, the low percentage of smudge cells (\u226430%) was an independent predictor of the shortened time to treatment (HR 1.86, 95%CI 1.09\u20133.16, p=0.02). Conclusion: This multicenter study confirms our initial finding that the percentage of smudge cells on a blood smear is an independent predictor of clinical outcome in patients with CLL. The estimation of smudge cell percentage on routine blood smear provides a simple and inexpensive prognostic test available to nearly all patients with a diagnosis of CLL worldwide. It also allows reanalysis and risk stratification of previously completed trials provided that blood smears have been archived. Further studies of the role of the cytoskeleton in CLL biology are warranted and ongoing in our laboratory. View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure  Close modal",
