    "abstract_text": "In multiple myeloma (MM), bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to tumor neoangiogenesis and their levels covary with tumor mass and prognosis. Recent X-chromosome inactivation studies in female patients showed that, similar to tumor cells, EPCs are clonally restricted in MM. Genomic profiling of MM using high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) has been previously utilized to mine the genome and find clinical correlates in MM patients. In this study, clonotypic aspects of bone marrow-derived EPCs and MM cells were investigated using aCGH and expression profiling analysis. Confluent EPCs were outgrown from bone marrow aspirates by adherence to laminin. EPCs were >98% vWF/CD133/KDR+ and 50% CD38+. For aCGH and for gene expression profiling, genomic DNA and total RNA from EPCs and MM cells were hybridized to human oligonucleotide arrays (Agilent Technologies) and human cDNA microarrays (Affymetrix), respectively. High resolution aCGH with segmentation analysis showed that EPCs and MM cells in one of ten cases share identical patterns of chromosomal gains and losses, while another 5 cases shared multiple focal copy number alterations (CNAs) including gains and losses. The genomes of EPCs and MM cells additionally displayed exclusive CNAs, but these were far fewer in EPCs than in MM cells. In 3 patients, EPCs harbored a common 0.6Mb deletion at 1q21 not shared by MM cells. Pertinent genes in this region that could affect proliferation and tumor suppression include N2N, NBPF10, and TXNIP. Validation studies of aCGH findings by other methods are ongoing. Gene expression profiling showed decreased expression of 1q21 region genes (e.g., calgranulin C and lamin A/C). A genome-wide comparison of patients\u2019 MM cells and EPCs, which is focused on their shared genetic characteristics, will be presented.",
