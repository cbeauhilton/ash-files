    "abstract_text": "Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia (ALL) patients who relapse after transplantation have few therapeutic options. An immunotherapeutic approach that enhances the graft versus leukemia effect may improve their survival. We have developed a method for generating cord blood derived dendritic cells (CBDC) and transfecting them with high efficiency (>90% eGFP positivity) and viability (>90%) (BBMT 2006 12:855\u2013867). We postulate that CTL generated from total ALL RNA-loaded CBDC may be exploited in therapy and therefore tested their ability to control the kinetics of leukaemic growth in a NOD-SCID mouse model of human ALL. CTL induced using total RNA from the pre-B ALL Nalm-6 cell line lysed 49\u00b111% of Nalm-6 cells compared to 7%\u00b11% of autologous and 2.5%\u00b11.3% of allogeneic mononuclear cells (p=0.03 and p=0.022 respectively). Using total RNA from patient derived ALL xenograft, we generated anti-leukemic CTL cultures comprising a mixed population of 69.9\u00b12% CD4, 12.9\u00b12% CD8 and 17.6\u00b11% NK cells. These CTL lysed 63\u00b16% of ALL xenograft targets and 22\u00b17% of autologous MNC (p=0.04) and also lysed autologous survivin mRNA-transfected DC (16\u00b15.4%). Preliminary results suggest that some of the ALL xenograft CTL also recognize the cell surface protein, HM1.24, which is specifically up-regulated in metastatic tumor cells and chemoresistant cancer cells. This suggests that the total ALL RNA generated CTL comprise a polyclonal population, which may prove efficacious in vivo . To test the in vivo efficacy of these anti-leukemic CTL, we established a NOD-SCID mouse model of ALL using patient samples. By varying the inocula of ALL cells, we established a predictable and reproducible model of emerging relapse. Administration of anti-leukaemic CTL 2, 3, 4 and 5 weeks post ALL inoculation, in increasing doses (low - 2.5\u00d710 6 cells/mouse, medium - 10\u00d710 6 /mouse and high - 20\u00d710 6 /mouse), altered the kinetics of ALL growth in vivo (p=0.00032, see figure). By 8 weeks post transplant, mice given ALL alone had 3.6% human CD45 + CD19 + leukemic cells in the blood, whereas recipients of the highest CTL dose had only 0.66% CD45 + CD19 + leukemic cells in the blood (p=0.05). After 11 weeks the disease load was the same in mice who received ALL alone and those who received ALL and 4 doses of 20 \u00d7 10 6 CTL. These results suggest that anti-leukemic CTL generated by RNA-loaded CBDC can control leukaemia in a NOD-SCID mouse model and that disease control may be enhanced by antigen-specific restimulation of the anti-leukaemic CTL and/or more refined administration. These results represent an important step forward in the development of clinical immunotherapy protocols for the treatment of ALL and its potential application after cord blood transplantation.
