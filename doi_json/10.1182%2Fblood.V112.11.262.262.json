    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL) is a type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that typically responds to initial chemo-immunotherapy, but with a relatively short duration of response (DR) and progression-free survival (PFS) when treated with conventional chemotherapy agents. Although the overall survival (OS) of MCL has improved, most patients are not cured and new agents are needed. A sub-analysis of a recent phase II trial (NHL-002) investigating the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL, demonstrated a promising overall response rate (ORR) of 53% with a median DR of 11.9 months. A confirmatory international phase II trial (NHL-003) of single-agent lenalidomide was initiated for patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive NHL that had received at least one prior treatment and had measurable disease. In this report, we analyze the current results from the MCL patients enrolled in this trial. Methods: Patients with relapsed or refractory MCL and measurable disease \u22652 cm after at least 1 prior treatment regimen were eligible. Patients received 25 mg of lenalidomide orally once daily on days 1\u201321 of every 28-day cycle. Patients continued therapy until disease progression or toxicity. The 1999 IWLRC methodology was used to assess response and progression. Results: This report focuses on the 39 MCL patients that were enrolled and evaluable for response assessment. Median age was 66 (33\u201382) years and 29 (74%) patients were male. Median time from diagnosis to lenalidomide treatment was 3.4 (0.4\u20139) years. Patients had received a median of 3 (1\u20138) prior treatments, and 23% (9/39) of patients had received prior bortezomib treatment. The ORR with lenalidomide was 41% (16/39), including 13% (5/39) complete response (CR)/unconfirmed CR, and 28% (11/39) partial responses. Ten (26%) patients had stable disease. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (51%) and thrombocytopenia (25%), anemia (13%), fatigue (10%) and febrile neutropenia (10%). Conclusion: These results confirm that lenalidomide oral monotherapy is effective in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory MCL, with manageable side effects."
