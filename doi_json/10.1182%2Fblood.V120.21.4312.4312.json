    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4312 OBJECTIVE: Cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease, in terms of genetic/molecular abnormalities resulting into marked differences in outcome. We demonstrated that MDR1 , BAALC expression was of prognostic significance and high MDR1 expression correlated with a high BAALC expression ( r = 0.487, P <0.001) in cytogenetically normal AML in the prophase study then we hypothesized that MDR1 and BAALC expression together would better identify the patient's risk profile. METHODS: Pretreatment bone marrow samples from 92 cytogenetically normal AML patients were analyzed for MDR1 and BAALC mRNA expression by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Patients were divided into low MDR1 and BAALC expression group and combined group (high MDR1 and/or high BAALC expression) according to MDR1 and BAALC levels and were compared for clinical outcome. RESULTS: 73 cases of 92 cytogenetically normal AML patients got CR after the first block with a CR rate being 79.3%. However, 29 cases of the CR patients relapsed with the relapsed rate being 39.7%. In contrast, Patients with low expression of both MDR1 and BAALC had a higher CR rate ( 93.3%vs72.6% , P =0.021), lower relapse rate ( 7.1% vs. 42.5%, P =0.000), longer OS ( 50.3% vs 17.8%,P = 0.00 1) than high MDR1 and/or high BAALC expression (combined group) in cytogenecally normal AML. Results showed no statistical difference in CR rate ( 93.3%vs85.7% , P =0.341),relapse rate ( 7.1% vs. 8.8%, P =0.000) and OS ( 50.3% vs 63.1%,P = 0.43 1) for cytogenetically normal patients with both MDR1 and BAALC low expression comparing to those with low-risk cytogenetically abnormal. CONCLUSION: The combined assessment of BAALC and MDR1 expression can improve treatment stratification in adult cytogenetically normal AML. Low expression of both MDR1 and BAALC identifies cytogenetically normal AML patients with a favorable long-term outcome. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
