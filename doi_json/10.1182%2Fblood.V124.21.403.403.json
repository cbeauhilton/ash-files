    "abstract_text": "Background : Recent studies have suggested significant associations between karyotype and certain molecular or phenotypic features in primary myelofibrosis (PMF). In the current study of 835 consecutive patients, we examined the spectrum and prevalence of cytogenetic abnormalities in PMF and their molecular and phenotypic correlates. Methods : PMF diagnosis was according to World Health Organization criteria. Cytogenetic analysis and reporting was done according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature. Statistical analyses considered clinical and laboratory parameters obtained at time of cytogenetic studies. Spectrum and frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities : Analyzable metaphases were obtained in 826 (99%) of 835 patients studied; 681(82%) had \u226520 metaphases analyzed. 352 (42.6%) patients had abnormal karyotype, including 240 (68.2%) sole, 64 (18.2%) two and 48 (13.6%) complex; comparison of these groups revealed lower platelet count (p<0.01), higher DIPSS-plus score (p=0.03) and higher percentage of younger patients (p=0.04) with complex abnormalities. Monosomal karyotype was noted in 20 (5.7%) patients. Approximately 150 individual abnormalities were identified; most frequent were 20q- (23.3%), 13q- (18.2%), +8 (11.1%), +9 (9.9%), duplication of chromosome 1q (9.7%) and -7/7q- (7.1%). Other notable abnormalities including i(17q) (1.4%), 12p- (1.1%) and inv(3) (0.6%) were much less frequent. Trisomy 8 was the most frequent in the context of complex abnormality (25%). Among the 500 patients seen within one year of initial diagnosis, 179 (35.8%) had abnormal karyotype, which included 121 (67.6%) sole, 31 (17.3%) two and 27 (15.1%) complex abnormalities; the most common abnormalities were 20q- (24.6%), 13q- (15.1%), +8 (14%) and +9 (10%) whereas 11q- (1.7%), i(17q) (1.1%), inv(3) (0.6%), and 12p- (0.6%) were infrequent. Molecular correlates : 476 patients were annotated for JAK2 , CALR and MPL mutations; abnormal karyotype frequencies were 43% in JAK2 , 42% CALR , 33% MPL mutated and 34% triple-negative cases (p=0.3). 13q- was associated with mutant CALR (p=0.03) and +9 with mutant JAK2 (p=0.02). Subsets of patients were also screened for ASXL1 , EZH2 , IDH , SRSF2 , U2AF1 , and SF3B1 mutations; in all instances, mutational frequencies were higher in patients with normal karyotype, reaching significance with ASXL1 (p=0.02) and U2AF1 (p=0.01). Mutant SRSF2 was associated with 20q- (p=0.02). Phenotypic correlates : Phenotypic correlates included abnormal karyotype with anemia (p=0.02), leukopenia (p<0.01) and thrombocytopenia (p<0.01); complex karyotype with younger age (p=0.04) and thrombocytopenia (p<0.01); leukopenia with 20q-, +8 and -7/7q-; and thrombocytopenia with 20q- and -7/7q-. Cytopenias were less likely to occur with 13q- (p<0.01), which was instead associated with thrombocytosis (p<0.01). 20q- was associated with lower incidence of marked leukocytosis (p=0.02). Trisomy 8 was associated with lower incidences of constitutional symptoms (p<0.01) and marked splenomegaly (p<0.01). Conclusions : The association of 13q- with CALR mutations in PMF might underlie its association with both thrombocytosis and favorable prognosis. The association of +9 with JAK2 mutations might reflect selective clonal advantage through JAK2 V617F dosage enhancement or mutation-induced chromosomal instability. The association of 20q- with mutant SRSF2 and thrombocytopenia warrant further clarification of its reported association with favorable prognosis.
