    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma cells adherent within the bone marrow microenvironment exhibit protection from chemotherapy. Myeloma cells express the \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 receptor for fibronectin (Fn) and vitronectin (Vn), a receptor critical for tumor invasiveness and tumor angiogenesis. Disruption of angiogenesis or interference with adhesion of myeloma cells inhibits myeloma growth. Human myeloma cell line U266 exhibited 41% expression of \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 integrin by flow cytometry using LM609 monoclonal antibody (Chemicon) or 82% using MEDI-522 humanized antibody (Abegrin\u2122, kindly provided by Medimmune Oncology, Inc. and the National Cancer Institute). For bone marrow mononuclear cells from a patient with multiple myeloma, 99.5% of the CD38 positive myeloma cell fraction labeled with MEDI-522 antibody. Multiple myeloma cells exhibited resistance to doxorubicin when grown on fibronectin, vitronectin, or HS27a stromal cells (the latter generously provided by Dr. B. Torok-Storb). Antibody to \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 resulted in enhanced cell kill and apoptosis by doxorubicin when cells were grown on matrix proteins or stromal cells. U266 cells were incubated with \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 blocking antibody, or isotype control for one hour, before being plated on Fn, Vn, or on bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a control. Cells were then treated with 20\u03bcM doxorubicin, or no drug, for 16 hours at 37\u00b0C. Viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion, and apoptosis was assayed by Annexin-V and caspase-3 activity. Multicolor flow cytometry was performed with FITC labeled CD38 antibody to identify the myeloma cells, as well as antibodies to detect annexin V and caspase 3. On Fn, Vn, or stromal cell line HS27a, \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 function blocking antibody (LM 609) reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis (increased annexin V and caspase 3 staining).

Myeloma cells plated on the stromal cells exhibited chemoresistance, compared to the BSA control, while antibody to \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 restored cytotoxicity and apoptosis. MEDI-522 antibody reduced binding of U266 cells to fibronectin by 78%, and similar to results with the LM609 antibody, enhanced chemotherapy response on Fn or Vn, with reduction of cell viability and increase in apoptosis.

Inhibition of \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 integrin is thus able to overcome adhesion mediated chemotherapy resistance in myeloma cells. The Abegrin\u2122 antibody to \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 has undergone early phase trials in cancer patients, and we and others have shown that myeloma patient cells exhibit a high fraction of staining with this antibody. These preclinical studies support the novel application of Abegrin\u2122 for the treatment of multiple myeloma.",
