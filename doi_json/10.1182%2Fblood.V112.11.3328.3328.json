    "abstract_text": "Multiple Myeloma (MM) is the most common indication for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto HCT). However, little information is available regarding the outcome of patients (pts) with the rarer immunoglobulin subtypes IgD and IgM, which represent 2% and 0.5%, respectively, of all MM cases. In addition, IgD MM has been reported previously to have a poorer prognosis, at least after conventional therapy. The CIBMTR conducted a retrospective analysis of MM pts transplanted between 1995\u20132005 to describe the characteristics and results of auto HCT in IgD (n=36) and IgM (n=11) among 3578 MM patients with auto HCT during this period. Median follow-up of survivors was 41 (range 2\u2013130) months for pts with IgD and 58 (range 5\u2013101) months for those with IgM MM. Among pts with IgD subtype, median age was 52 years (yrs), 67% were male, 36% had a creatinine >2 mg/L, 61% had Durie-Salmon stage III disease at diagnosis and 33% had Kappa Serum Light chain; the corresponding values for IgM pts were 58 yrs, 36%, 73% and 55% respectively. Prior to auto HCT, 75% of IgD pts were chemosensitive and 25% had received >2 lines of chemotherapy, while all IgM pts were chemosensitive and none had received more than 2 lines of prior therapy. Median time from diagnosis to auto HCT was 9 months in both subtypes. The most common conditioning regimen was singleagent melphalan, and all but 1 pt with IgD disease were grafted with blood stem cells. The small sample size precluded multivariate analysis for potential prognostic factors for outcome. Below table summarizes the post-auto HCT results in these pts contrasted with a reference pool of IgG and IgA MM receiving auto HCT in the same time period.  Outcomes, probability (95% CI) . IgD .

These results are also consistent with published outcomes of pts with IgD/ IgM MM (Wechaleker et al Ann Hematol. 2005 Feb; 84(2):115\u20137; Maisner et al Bone Marrow Transplant. 2008 Jan; 41(1):51\u20134)."
