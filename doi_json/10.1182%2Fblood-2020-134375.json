    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The activity of immune checkpoint blockade including anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein-4 and anti-programmed cell death protein-1 monoclonal antibodies in hematologic malignancies is limited outside of classical Hodgkin lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. Tumor mutational burden (TMB), programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression, and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) are well-established biomarkers predicting response to checkpoint blockade in solid malignancies. In addition, tumors with high TMB, defined as \u226510 mutations/megabase (mut/Mb), and/or MSI-H are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tissue agnostic biomarkers for treatment with pembrolizumab. The frequencies of high TMB, MSI-H, and expression pattern of PD-L1 across specific hematologic malignancies are undefined. Methods: Patients with hematologic malignancies who had next generation sequencing (NGS) performed by Foundation One Heme were identified. TMB and MSI were measured by NGS. TMB was classified as high if \u226510 mut/Mb and low if <10 mut/Mb. When available, PD-L1 expression on tumor cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC) was also collected. PD-L1 IHC was performed with either Ventana (SP142) PD-L1 antibody or Dako (22C3) PD-L1 antibody. Scores were classified as high (\u2265 50%), low (1-49%), and negative (<1%) based on the percent of tumor cells staining positive for PD-L1. Pathology reports were retrospectively re-reviewed to determine the diagnosis. Results: A total of 390 patients with hematologic malignancies with NGS were identified. Forty eight of the 390 samples (12%) had a high TMB (Table 1). Twenty five of 45 (56%) patients with DLBCL had a high TMB (Table 2). The TMB was low in all myeloid malignancies tested. None of the 302 samples tested were MSI-H. PD-L1 IHC was performed on 86 samples. Eleven (13%) had high expression, 26 (30%) had low expression, and 49 (57%) had no expression of PD-L1 on the tumor cells (Table 1). The majority of samples with PD-L1 expression were mature lymphomas (81%). TMB and PD-L1 score had a significant linear relationship (R = 0.22, p = 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 - 0.41) (Figure 1). Conclusion: This study provides detailed characteristics of TMB, MSI status, and PD-L1 expression for hematologic malignancies. Notably, a subset of lymphomas had high TMB and/or PD-L1 expression. Biomarker driven studies of checkpoint blockade in hematologic malignancies with high TMB and/or PD-L1 expression are warranted.
