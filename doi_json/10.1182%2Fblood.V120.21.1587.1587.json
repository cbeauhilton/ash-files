    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1587 Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) with an immunophenotype consistent with marginal zone origin (MBL-MZ), that can be either CD5 \u2212 or CD5 + but atypical for CLL, and also lacking an IGH/CCND1 translocation, is an increasingly recognised entity with poorly understood biological background and clinical significance. In particular, it is not yet clarified whether it represents a precursor state to one of the distinct lymphoma entities recognized by WHO as deriving from MZ cells or whether it constitutes a novel entity, likely with similar ontogeny. To obtain insight into this issue we retrospectively evaluated a series of 71 patients (male/female: 35/36, median age: 73.3 years) with lymphocytosis (median lymphocyte count: 5.77 \u00d7 10 9 /l) detected incidentally on a routine blood test. No case had lymphadenopathy, organomegaly or any clinical features to suggest a concurrent marginal zone lymphoma. Hemoglobin and platelet counts were normal in all cases; 15/57 (26%) cases had paraproteinemia. Peripheral blood immunophenotyping revealed the presence of a clonal B-cell population with Matutes score <2 in all cases. Individual markers were expressed as follows: CD5: 15/71, CD23: 7/70, CD79\u03b2: 60/64, FMC7: 50/67, CD49d: 35/35, CD38: 6/53. In 8/45 cases assessed with CT-scan and/or ultrasound, borderline splenomegaly was observed. Histopathological examination of the bone marrow biopsy (BMB) was available in 11 cases and demonstrated mostly mixed patterns of neoplastic lymphocytic inflitration from small B cells. Karyotype data were available in 66 cases; 48/66 (72.7%) had abnormal karyotype. Main cytogenetic findings are as follows: (1) translocations: n=16 cases of which 3 carried t(2;7)(p11;q21/22); (2) isochromosome 17q: n=8; (3) trisomy 12: n=8; (4) del(7q): n=7; (5) trisomy 3: n=4. Immunogenetic analysis revealed overusage of the IGHV4\u201334 gene (15/63, 23.8%). Notably, the IGHV1\u20132 gene was utilized by a single case, thus sharply contrasting (p<0.0001) splenic marginal-zone lymphoma (SMZL) with a reported frequency of IGHV1\u20132 in excess of 30%. Seven of 63 rearrangements (11.1%) carried IGHV genes with no somatic mutations, whereas the remainder (56/63, 88.9%) exhibited some impact of somatic hypermutation (SHM), ranging from minimal to (mostly) pronounced. Overall, cases of the present study exhibited a significantly (p<0.005) higher SHM load compared to SMZL. With a median follow-up of 4.9 years (0.8\u201320), 54 cases (group A) remain stable with no signs of progression. The remaining 17 cases (group B) have MBL along with clinical or histopathologic evidence of lymphoma. In particular: (i) a female with MBL as an incidental finding, also carrying t(2;7), was eventually diagnosed with gastric MALT lymphoma at +11 months from presentation; immunogenetic analysis confirmed clonal identity between the MBL and the lymphoma; (ii) 2 cases developed lymphadenopathy; (iii) a single case developed diffuse large B cell lymphoma of the skin; and, (iv) 13 cases developed splenomegaly and, thus, can be considered as either SMZL or splenic lymphoma/leukemia unclassifiable (SLLU). Groups A and B did not differ in terms of demographics, diagnostic blood counts (including clonal MBL count) and SHM status; the only difference concerned cytogenetic profiles, with i(17)(q10) and del(7q) being almost exclusive to group A. In conclusion, we demonstrate that MBL-MZ can be the presenting feature of occult MZ lymphoma, most frequently SMZL/SLLU. However, in a sizeable proportion of cases, MBL-MZ remains stable over time with no evidence of organ involvement and distinct immunogenetic features from SMZL, thereby raising the possibility that it might represent a newcomer to the spectrum of B-cell lymphoproliferations of MZ origin.
