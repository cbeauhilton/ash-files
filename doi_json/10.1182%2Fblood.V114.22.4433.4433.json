    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4433 Object This study was aimed to investigate the expression of c-FLIPL, c-FLIPS and DLK1 mRNA in Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) patients, as compared with normal people and AML patients, and to find its clinical significance. Methods The expression of c-FLIPL, c-FLIPS and DLK1 mRNA in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMNNC) of 16 patients with MDS, 8 patients with AML and 3 controls were detected by RT-PCR. Results The expression of DLK1 mRNA was up-regulated in MDS, including RA and RAEB, as compared with controls( P <0.05). There was no significant difference in expression of DLK1 between RA and RAEB( P >0.05). The expression of DLK1 was significant higher in AML patients, compared with controls( P <0.05). There was no significant difference between MDS and AML patients( P >0.05). The expression of c-FLIPL mRNA was higher than that in controls, both in RA and RAEB( P <0.05). There was no significant difference in expression of c-FLIPL between RA and RAEB( P >0.05). In eight AML patients, c-FLIPL gene's expression was up-regulated, as compared with controls( P <0.05). Between AML and MDS patients, there was no significant difference( P >0.05); The expression of c-FLIPS mRNA had no significant difference between MDS patients and controls( P >0.05), but its expression in RAEB was significant higher as compared with RA patients and controls( P <0.05). And in AML patients, the expression of c-FLIPS was higher than that in controls( P <0.05), but there was no significant difference between AML and MDS patients( P >0.05). Conclusion It is concluded that the expressions of DLK1, c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS mRNA in MDS/AML patients are abnormal as compared with normal people, although there are no significant difference have been found between AML and MDS. These genes may play critical roles in escaping malignant clone of MDS from apoptosis and acquiring the ability to divide unlimitedly, they can become important indexes for evaluating of development in MDS.
