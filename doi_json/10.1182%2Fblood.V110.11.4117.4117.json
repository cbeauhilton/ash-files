    "abstract_text": "Transcription factor AML1/RUNX1, initially isolated from the t(8;21) chromosomal translocation in human leukemia, is essential for the development of multilineage hematopoiesis in mouse embryos. AML1 negatively regulates the number of immature hematopoietic cells in adult hematopoiesis, while it is required for megakaryocytic maturation and lymphocytic development. However, it remains yet to be determined how AML1 contributes to homeostasis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). To address this issue, we analyzed in detail HSC function in the absence of AML1. Notably, cells in the Hoechst 33342 side population fraction and c-Kit-positive cells in the G0 cell cycle status were increased in number in AML1-deficient bone marrow, which suggests enrichment of quiescent HSCs. We also found an increase in HSC number within the AML1-deficient bone marrow using limiting dilution bone marrow transplantation assays. Thus, the number of quiescent HSCs is negatively regulated by AML1, loss of which may result in accumulation of leukemic stem cell pool in AML1-related leukemia. To identify mechanisms through which functional loss of AML1 exerts leukemogenic potential, we focused on the AML1-Evi-1 chimeric protein, which is generated by the t(3;21) chromosomal translocation and disturbs the normal function of AML1. We introduced AML1-Evi-1 and its mutants into murine bone marrow cells, and evaluated hematopoietic cell transformation by colony replating assays. The transforming activity of AML1-Evi-1 was impaired when any of the major functional domains of AML1-Evi-1 was lost. Moreover, overexpression of Evi-1 could not transform AML1-deleted bone marrow cells, suggesting that fusion of AML1 and Evi-1, rather than AML1 suppression and Evi-1 overexpression, is essential for AML1-Evi-1 leukemogenesis. Intriguingly, among the hematopoietic progenitor cell fractions, AML1-Evi-1 could transform only the uncommitted, immature hematopoietic cells, which contrasts with MLL-ENL, a chimeric protein generated in t(11;19) leukemia. AML1-Evi-1 transformed cells show a surface marker profile different from that of the cells transformed by AML1-MTG8/ETO, another leukemic gene product that also perturbs AML1 function. These results provide a valuable clue to a distinct mechanism determined by the Evi-1 moiety in the AML1-Evi-1 leukemogenesis and to a role of AML1 loss in the self-renewal of leukemic stem cells."
