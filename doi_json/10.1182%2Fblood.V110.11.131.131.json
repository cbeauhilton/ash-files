    "abstract_text": "Background: \u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen is a newly-emerging cardiovascular disease (CVD) biomarker that has shown significant associations with coronary artery disease in small case/control studies. \u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen is an isoform with an altered \u03b3 chain, and constitutes \u223c10% of total fibrinogen. Both elevated \u03b3\u2019 and total fibrinogen cause fibrinolytic resistance in vitro. However, data are lacking from community based studies on the association of \u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen with CVD risk factors or with clinical CVD. Methods: \u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen levels were measured using an ELISA assay in 3284 men and women in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort 7th examination cycle (2002\u201305). Associations of \u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen were examined using linear regression for continuous CVD risk factors and logistic regression for prevalent CVD and other dichotomous measures. Results: The ELISA CV was 9.3% at mean \u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen levels. Participants (mean age 60 years, 53.4% women) with prevalent CVD (0.297 \u00b1 0.007 mg/ml; mean \u00b1 SE) had significantly higher mean concentrations than those without CVD (0.255 \u00b1 0.002 mg/ml). There were significant (all p<0.05) associations between \u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen levels with several cardiovascular risk factors, including age, BMI, systolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, and total cholesterol, and an inverse association with HDL cholesterol. \u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen was associated with prevalent CVD with an odds ratio of 1.76 (95% CI 1.06\u20132.92) for the highest compared to the lowest tertile, after adjustment for all of the above risk factors. As expected, since \u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen constitutes a subset of total fibrinogen, \u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen was correlated with total fibrinogen. However, if we included both \u03b3\u2019 and total fibrinogen in further analyses of association with CVD, the odds ratio was 3.08 (95% CI 1.41\u20136.72) for the combined tertile of both the highest \u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen and highest total fibrinogen, an odds ratio that was substantially higher than that for either marker alone. Conclusions: \u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen is associated with multiple CVD risk factors and with prevalent CVD, accounting for CVD risk factors, over and above total fibrinogen alone. Prospective studies are warranted to examine the ability of \u03b3\u2019 fibrinogen to predict CVD."
