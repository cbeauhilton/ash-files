    "abstract_text": "Antibody-targeted chemotherapy using tumor-targeted immunoconjugates of the cytotoxic agent, calicheamicin, is a clinically validated strategy for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Calicheamicin is a potent cytotoxic natural product that binds DNA in the minor groove and causes double strand DNA breaks. B lymphoid lineage-specific antigens CD19, CD20, and CD22 have been studied extensively as potential targets for therapeutic applications of immunotoxins. In order to determine which one of these three antigens is most suitable for antibody-targeted calicheamicin therapy, we conjugated monoclonal antibodies, BU12 (murine anti-CD19 mAb), rituximab (chimeric anti-CD20 mAb), and m5/44 (murine anti-CD22 mAb) to a hindered disulfide derivative of N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin and evaluated the anti-tumor activity of these conjugates against three human B-cell lymphoma lines (BCL), Ramos, Raji and RL. Each of these three mAb bound to their respective antigens on the surface of BCL and was modulated, indicative of their potential internalization. Immunoconjugates of these mAbs, prepared by covalently linking calicheamicin via either acid-labile or acid-resistant linkers, caused a potent inhibition of BCL growth in vitro (IC 50 s ranged from 7 pM for the acid-labile linked m544 up to 6.8 nM for the acid-resistant linked anti-CD20 conjugates of calicheamicin). Immunoconjugates with acid-labile linkers were more potent than their counterparts with the acid-stable linker and conjugates targeted to either CD19 or CD22 were more potent than those targeted to CD20 in inhibiting BCL growth in vitro. In contrast, unconjugated mAb to CD19 or CD22 had no effect on BCL growth in vitro whereas anti-CD20 mAb, at concentrations >1 \u03bcg/ml, had an inhibitory effect of 30% on in vitro BCL growth. When examined for their effects on the growth of established subcutaneous BCL xenografts in nude mice, calicheamicin conjugated to anti-CD22 was by far the most efficacious conjugate against each of the three BCL xenografts studied. Calicheamicin conjugated to rituximab caused significant inhibition of BCL growth but was less effective than the conjugates of anti-CD22 or anti-CD19 mAb. Interestingly, anti-CD19 conjugates of calicheamicin, while effective in vitro against both Raji and Ramos BCL and effective against Raji BCL xenografts, had no effect on the growth of Ramos BCL xenografts in vivo. The reasons underlying the lack of anti-tumor activity of CD19-targeted calicheamicin conjugate against Ramos xenografts in vivo remain unknown. Based on a number of factors including the potent and consistent anti-tumor activity of the anti-CD22-conjugated calicheamicin, CD22 was selected as the molecular target for further development. A calicheamicin conjugate containing an acid-labile linker of humanized anti-CD22 mAb, CMC-544, is currently being evaluated in phase I clinical trials in non-Hodgkin\u2019s B-cell lymphoma.",
