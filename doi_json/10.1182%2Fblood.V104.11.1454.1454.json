    "abstract_text": "Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is an inheritable hematopoietic disorder that is characterized by extremely low levels of neutrophils in peripheral circulation and maturation arrest of bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells at the promyelocytic stage of differentiation. SCN patients have recurring severe infections and approximately 10% of these patients evolve to develop acute myelogenous leukemia. Recently we reported that an impaired cell survival and cell cycle arrest of bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells was observed in SCN patients compared with controls. We also reported various heterozygous mutations in the neutrophil elastase (NE) gene encoding a serine protease in approximately 80% of SCN patients. We hypothesized that mutations in the NE gene trigger apoptotic cell death of myeloid progenitor cells and subsequent severe neutropenia. Mutational analysis of 15 families with one or more affected family members revealed that mutant NE was present only in affected but not in healthy members of these families suggesting the causative role for mutant NE in pathogenesis of SCN. Sequencing analysis revealed that none of SCN patients negative for NE mutations examined had mutations in the Gfi-1 or WAS gene. Sequencing DNA samples of SCN and SCN/AML patients revealed 40 mutations that are distributed primarily throughout the exons 2 through 5 of the NE gene and result in substitution, deletion, insertion, or truncation mutations. Molecular modeling of the tertiary structure of NE revealed that all these mutations can be grouped into three major categories. The first category includes 19 substitution and insertion mutations that are grouped around the N-glycosylation sites of the neutrophil elastase and may lead to abnormal targeting and subcellular localization of the mutant protease. The second group includes 9 substitution and deletion mutations that alter the side loop of the NE that is necessary for proper oligomerization of neutrophil elastase. The third category includes 12 substitution, truncation, and deletion mutations that either alter or completely eliminate the carboxy-terminus of the mutant protein leading to conformational changes of the binding pocket of the NE, and subsequently to altered substrate specificity and/or an acquired resistance to elastase inhibitors. SCN patients that evolved to develop AML had either substitution, deletion, or truncation mutations from each of the three categories described above. Most mutations are clearly non-conservative, have destabilizing effect on oligomeric structure of mutant protein, and alter dramatically the affinity of mutant NE to various factors participating in its processing and intracellular transport. Flow cytometry analysis of annexin V-labeled cells revealed that expression of representative mutant but not normal NE from each of the three categories of NE mutations in human promyelocytic HL-60 cells triggered apoptotic cell death similar to that observed in bone marrow progenitor cells in SCN patients. These data indicate that impaired cell survival and block of differentiation in SCN is due to heterozygous mutations in the neutrophil elastase gene. Current studies focused on design and screen of specific protease inhibitors capable of blocking the pro-apoptotic effect of mutant neutrophil elastase.",
