    "abstract_text": "Double strand DNA repair can be epigenetically modulated to sensitize the malignant cells to chemotherapy. CTV-1 and Molt-3 were segregated as T-acute lymphoblastic cells (T-ALL) according to their expression profiles. We found in these cells doxorubicin, a topoisomerase II (TOP2) inhibitor, induced expression and phosphorylation of cell cycle checkpoint kinase 1(CHK1) associated with G2 cell cycle arrest before achieving apoptosis; while a histone deacetylation inhibitor (HDACi), suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), synergistically enhanced cell death by attenuation of expression and phosphorylation of CHK1, and by attenuated expression and phosphorylation of a double strand DNA repair protein, C-terminal binding protein (CtBP)-interacting protein [CtIP], and was associated with shortened G2 cell cycle arrest. Very often is Doxorubicin as a topoisomerase II inhibitor enrolled in the treatment of T-ALL. We evidenced with isobologram synergistic cell-killing by doxorubicin and SAHA in CTV-1 and Molt-3 T-ALL cell lines of which expression and phosphorylation of CHK1 were negatively affected by SAHA. In the SAHA-treated T-ALL cells, the repair of doxorubicin-induced double strand DNA break (DSB) was associated with increased \u03b3H2AX. However, although SAHA increased expression of \u03b3H2AX and acetyl H2AX, apoptosis was enhanced with shortened G2/M arrest and the hampered nuclear entry of CtIP revealed by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. HDACi thus synergistically impaired the topoisomerase II-induced DSB repair and enhanced apoptosis by eliciting DNA repair with \u03b3H2AX expression; however, aborted the DNA repair and induced apoptosis by hampering the nuclear entry of CtIP. Attenuation of activated CHK1 may be potentially a biomarkers of synergistic cytotoxicities of HDACi and DSB-inducing chemotherapeutics. Disclosures Off Label Use: in vitro study only. suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid in combination with topoisomerase II inhibitor may have synergistic effects. .",
