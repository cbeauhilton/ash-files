    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most frequent subtype of high-grade lymphoma in Latin American patients. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has shown to be prognostic in patients with DLBCL in Asia, Europe, and the United States. We previously reported that NLR \u22654 was an adverse prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) in DLBCL patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy. We aim to assess the prognostic and predictive role of NLR \u22654 in a learning cohort of DLBCL patients from South America and confirm the findings in a validation cohort of DLBCL patients from Mexico. Methods: The study period was from January 2002 through January 2018, and included patients with de novo DLBCL treated with standard chemoimmunotherapy with a curative intent. A cohort of patients from South America (Peru, Argentina, Venezuela, Chile and Colombia) was the learning cohort, a cohort of patients from Mexico was the validation cohort. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional-hazard regression models were fitted for complete response (CR) as well as for OS in the learning cohort and the validation cohort, separately. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Results: A total of 597 patients with a diagnosis of DLBCL were included. The learning cohort included 274 patients, and the validation cohort included 323 patients. In the learning cohort, CR rates for DLBCL patients with NLR \u22654 and NLR <4 were 62% and 78%, respectively (p=0.003). In the multivariate analyses for CR, advanced stage and NLR \u22654 were associated with lower odds of CR (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.21-0.70, p=0.002; and OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27-1.63, p=0.006, respectively). NLR \u22654 was independently associated with lower rates of CR when adjusted for the IPI and the NCCN-IPI scores (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27-0.79, p=0.005; and OR 0.47,95% CI 0.28-0.81, p=0.006, respectively). The 5-year OS rates for DLBCL patients with NLR \u22654 was 58% versus 70% for patients with NLR <4. In the multivariate analyses for OS, advanced stage (HR 2.47, 95% CI 1.55-3.93; p<0.001) and NLR \u22654 (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.20-2.36; p=0.04) were statistically significant factors associated with worse OS. NLR \u22654 was an adverse prognostic factor after adjusting for the IPI and the NCCN-IPI scores (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.01-2.28; p=0.04; and HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.01-2.21; p=0.04, respectively). In the validation cohort, CR rates for DLBCL patients with NLR \u22654 and NLR <4 were 64% and 81%, respectively (p=0.001). In the multivariate analyses for CR, elevated LDH level and NLR \u22654 were associated with lower odds of CR (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29-0.97, p=0.04; and OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27-0.88, p=0.01, respectively). NLR \u22654 was independently associated with lower rates of CR when adjusted for IPI score and the NCCN-IPI score (OR 0.46,95% CI 0.26-0.82, p=0.008; and OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25-0.81, p=0.007, respectively). The 5-year OS rates for DLBCL patients with NLR \u22654 was 48% versus 68% for patients with an NLR<4. In the multivariate analysis for OS; ECOG \u22651 (HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.24-2.77; p<0.003), advanced stage (HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.28-3.26, p=0.003) and NLR \u22654 (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.22-2.65; p=0.03) were independent factors associated with worse OS. NLR \u22654 was an adverse prognostic factor after adjusting for IPI score and NCCN-IPI score (HR 1.81, 95% CI 1.24-2.64; p=0.002; and HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.34-2.86; p=0.001, respectively). Conclusion: This multi-institutional collaborative study identifies and validates an easy-to-use tool, NLR \u22654, as an independent factor predictive of lower rates of CR and prognostic of worse survival, independent of the IPI and the NCCN-IPI scores, in Latin-American patients with DLBCL treated with standard chemoimmunotherapy.
