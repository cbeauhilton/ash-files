    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4132 The objective was to definite the expression level of aven mRNA of white blood cells from peripheral blood(PB)of de novo acute myeloid leukemia and preliminary analyze its clinical significance, providing a experimental basis for evaluating prognosis. Aven mRNA levels in PB samples from 69 AML patients were detected by using real-time quantitative PCR. The relation of aven mRNA level with clinical and hematological characteristics (age, sex, WBC, Hb, Plt, LDH, Blast% in PB and BM,FAB subtype) and treatment outcome (complete remission rate and relapse rate)were analyzed. Twenty-one normal individuals served as controls. The level of aven mRNA was between 11.72% and 178.93 %(median 37.2%) in de novo AML and between 10.81% and 50.98 %(median 28.81%) in normal individuals. Aven mRNA level was higher in the AML group than in the controls ( p =0.006). When we compared aven mRNA with other clinical and hematological parameters, there were significant correlations between aven mRNA and age(r=0.25,p=0.039),aven mRNA and hemoglobin level (r=0.29,p=0.019),aven mRNA and FAB subtype(r=0.253,p=0.036). We found that median level of aven mRNA in group whose age older than median age was higher than group whose age younger than median level(p=0.018).The complete remission rate after two cycles chemotherapy in group with lower aven mRNA level(25/30,83.33%)was higher than group with higher aven mRNA level(21/30,70%). But the difference was not significant(p=0.22).The difference of aven mRNA expression level between AML patients with relapse and that without relapse was not significant (p=0.076). In conclusions, the level of aven mRNA in de novo AML is overexpression. The overexpression of aven mRNA is likely to play an important role in tumorigenesis of AML. Association of aven mRNA expression with treatment outcome and relapse was not observed. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
