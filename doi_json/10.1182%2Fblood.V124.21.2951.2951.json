    "abstract_text": "Background: Nodular Lymphocyte Predominant Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma (NLPHL) is an uncommon subtype of Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma. The risk for secondary primary cancers is not well understood. Methods: The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was used to identify cases of NLPHL diagnosed up to 12/31/2011. The Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) was calculated as the ratio of observed to expected cases of secondary primary malignancies based on incidence data in the general United States population. The latency exclusion period from the date of diagnosis was 60 months. We also investigated for possible modifying effects of gender, age at diagnosis (20-39 years of age and \u2265 40 years of age), use of radiation therapy, and latency periods (5-10 years and >10 years) after initial diagnosis of NLPHL. Results: A total 947 cases of NLPHL were present in the database. Secondary primary cancer cases occurred in 64 cases with 36 (56.3%) solid tumors and 28 (43.8%) hematological malignancy cases. Radiation was administered in 38 (59.4%) of secondary primary cancer cases. Females had an increased risk of Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma (NHL) (SIR: 13.86, p10 years, after the initial diagnosis, was associated with increased risk of \u201cAll Solid Tumors\u201d (SIR: 2.62, p<0.05), Thyroid cancer (SIR: 16.64, p<0.05), and NHL (SIR: 35.68, p<0.05). Conclusion: NLPHL is associated with an increased risk of secondary primary cancers, both solid and hematological malignancies. Thyroid cancer and NHL were the most frequent tumors observed in patients ten years after initial NLPHL diagnosis. Radiation treatment for NLPHL increased the risk for solid tumors, including colorectal cancer. Further research is necessary to clarify optimal surveillance technique in patients after treatment of NLPHL. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
