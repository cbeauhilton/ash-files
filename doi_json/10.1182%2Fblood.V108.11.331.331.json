    "abstract_text": "More than 21 million prescriptions for warfarin are written yearly in the US. Yet, in spite of its importance, vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR), the target of warfarin, has resisted purification since its identification in 1972. We report the first successful purification and reconstitution of activity of a recombinant human vitamin K epoxide reductase. A series of detergents were screened to determine that best for solubilization of VKOR from microsomes. Detergents tested that were effective in solubilization of VKOR also led to loss of measurable activity. This loss of activity supports our previous prediction that VKOR is embedded in and requires a membrane environment for enzymatic activity. The short-chain phospholipid, DHPC (1,2-Dihexanoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine) was the detergent of choice to efficiently extract VKOR from the microsomes, even though this reagent completely inhibited enzyme activity. Partial reconstitution was achieved on-column by washing with 0.4 % dioleoylphosphatidylcholine/0.4% deoxycholate. Complete recovery of activity was achieved by removing the deoxycholate through dialysis in the presence of the reducing reagent, THP (Tris(hydroxypropyl)phosphine). During dialysis, the solution became cloudy indicating the formation of membrane-like structure. Purified recombinant VKOR is ~21 kDa (~18.5 kDa + tag); fully active; and over 93% pure. The concentration of warfarin for 50% inhibition is the same for purified protein and microsomes. It has been reported and assumed that VKOR is a multi-subunit enzyme. Our results, however, suggest that a single peptide can accomplish the reaction. The trace amounts of contaminating proteins were identified by mass spectrometry; however, none are apparently relevant to the VKOR reaction. Moreover, the turn-over number of purified VKOR (0.25 sec-1 is approximately two-fold higher than microsomes and about 10 fold higher than the turnover number of gamma-glutamyl carboxylase for CO2 addition. In addition to the vitamin K epoxide to vitamin K reaction, our results also indicate that VKOR can efficiently convert vitamin K to vitamin K epoxide. Our results suggest that ancillary proteins (other than a thioredoxin-like enzyme) are not necessary for full VKOR activity. This purification will allow further characterization of VKOR in relation to other components of the vitamin K cycle and should facilitate its structural determination."
