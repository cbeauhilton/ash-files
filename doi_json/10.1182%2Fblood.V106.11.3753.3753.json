    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The European Best Practice Guidelines for the Anaemia Management (EBPG) recently published emerged as an international standard in the management of anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of theses guidelines in the clinical practice in Portugal. Methods: This epidemiological, multicentric and cross-sectional study included patients on peritoneal dialysis that were under erythropoietin treatment in Portugal during 2004. Etiology of CKD, prevalence and anaemia treatment, comorbidity and side effects were evaluated. Results: 220 patients from 5 Units were evaluated. Mean haemoglobin was 12.34 g/dL and only 13,2% of patients had haemoglobin  11 g/dl and no significant difference in haemoglobin levels was achieved in the two groups (beta and darbe). Erythropoietin doses were greater in the group treated with darbe (127 versus 113 UI/kg/week), but inflammation markers were significantly higher as well diabetic patients in this group. Conclusion: These results suggest that, according to the EBPG\u2019s, mostly patients on PD in Portugal are already being well treated presenting heamoglobin levels in the therapeutic range.",
