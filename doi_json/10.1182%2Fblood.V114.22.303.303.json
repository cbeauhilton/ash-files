    "abstract_text": "Abstract 303 Background: Carfilzomib (CFZ) is a novel proteasome inhibitor that binds its target selectively and irreversibly, resulting in greater and more sustained proteasomal inhibition compared to BTZ (Demo et al, Cancer Res 2007). CFZ overcomes BTZ-resistance in vitro (Kuhn et al, Blood 2007) and in a previous Phase 2 study (PX-171-003), single-agent CFZ achieved durable responses and maintained disease control [e.g. \u2265 Stable Disease (SD)] in patients with progressive multiple myeloma (MM) despite treatment with essentially all available agents. PX-171-004 is an ongoing Phase 2 study of CFZ monotherapy in MM patients with relapsed or refractory disease following 1\u20133 prior therapies. Here we report updated data for the BTZ-treated cohort. Methods: Patients with relapsed or refractory (defined as < 25% response or disease progression during therapy) MM were enrolled and stratified based on prior BTZ exposure (e.g. BTZ-nai\u0308ve and BTZ-treated). For the BTZ-treated cohort, tolerability and response to prior BTZ [\u2265 Minor Response (MR)] was not required. CFZ 20 mg/m 2 IV was administered on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16 every 28 days, for up to 12 cycles. The primary endpoint was Overall Response Rate (ORR) [\u2265 Partial Response (PR)] by IMWG criteria. Secondary endpoints included Clinical Benefit Response (CBR = ORR + MR) and safety. Results: Thirty-five BTZ-treated patients were enrolled. Six (17%) patients had previously received BTZ exclusively as a single agent, 15 (43%) received BTZ as part of a chemotherapy combination and 10 (29%) received BTZ as part of a stem cell transplant (SCT) regimen. An additional 4 (11%) received BTZ in a chemotherapy combination as well as part of a separate transplant regimen. Other prior therapies included alkylators (89%), SCT (81%), thalidomide (69%), lenalidomide (37%), and anthracyclines (31%). Six (17%) patients had disease refractory to BTZ and 9 (26%) additional patients had discontinued BTZ due to toxicities. At baseline, 19 (54 %) patients had an ECOG score \u2265 1, 17 (49%) patients had neuropathy of Grade \u2265 1, 9 (26%) patients had impaired renal function (CrCl  19 cycles on a recently initiated extended treatment protocol. Conclusions: In a BTZ-exposed population that includes BTZ treatment failures and significant comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, renal insufficiency, etc), the 18% ORR (CBR 30%) is notable for this steroid- and anthracycline-sparing regimen. Single-agent CFZ is well tolerated, even in patients with renal insufficiency, and both myelosuppression and PN are uncommon. These data support the continuing evaluation of CFZ as a safe and effective treatment option in MM.
