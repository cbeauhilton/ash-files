    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4177 Introduction National and international organizations recognize that low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are distinct entities and that they should not be used interchangeably in clinical practice. Physicochemical properties, such as molecular weight anti-Xa/anti-IIa ratios, are used by health authorities to establish LMWHs differentiation. LMWHs are multitargeted drugs in which small differences in physicochemical properties may lead to significantly different inhibition of blood coagulation. In the present in vitro study we have investigated if thrombin generation assay, reflecting the overall coagulation process, is a suitable tool for the LMWH variability evalution. Materials and methods LMWHs (bemiparin, enoxaparin, nadroparin, dalteparin and tinzaparin) and unfractionated heparin (UFH) were added in vitro in normal citrated platelet rich plasma from 10 healthy individuals, at clinically relevant concentrations (ranging from 0.2 to 1 anti-Xa IU/ml). Thrombin generation was studied with Thrombogram-Thrombinoscope \u00ae assay using diluted thromboplastin (Innovin \u00ae , 1/1000 final dilution, Siemens France). The concentrations doubling the lag-time, the time to Peak, the IC50 for Peak, the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) and the mean rate index of propagation phase (MRI) were determined for each compound. Results LMWHs compared on their anti-Xa activity basis showed variable inhibitory effect on thrombin generation. At equivalent anti-Xa concentrations tinzaparin was significantly more potent than the other LMWHs, being almost similar to UFH profile. Enoxaparin, nadroparin and dalteparin showed a similar inhibitory activity. Bemiparin had the lesser pronounced inhibitory effect on thrombin generation. The impact of anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities on each phase of thrombin generation process is different. Thrombogram chronometric parameters are mainly influenced by the anti-IIa activity. Similarly, ETP inhibition depends more on anti-IIa rather than anti-Xa activity. The MRI of the propagation phase is more sensitive to the anti-Xa activity of LMWHs. Conclusion Thrombin generation assessment in platelet rich plasma allows to evaluate the anticoagulant fingerprint of LMWHs and to differentiate them on global and functional criteria. Each LMWH has a particular inhibitory impact on each phase of thrombin generation process. These functional criteria need to be standardized and probably required for a better characterization of LMWHs heterogeneity by health authorities. They could be used also to evaluate bioequivalence of generic and original LMWHs. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
