    "abstract_text": "Abstract: [Objective] Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) has been used for the treatment of refractory leukemia and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) was used for the purpose of graft versus leukemia (GVL) effects. However, DLI is associated with a risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD). Thus, new cellular-based methods are desired. In the present study, we performed thymus transplantation (TT) plus allo-BMT to explore it\u2019s anti leukemia effects . [Methods] Recipient B6 mice (H-2 b ) bearing leukemia (EL-4 cells, H-2 b ) were irradiated 8 Gy. The next day, bone marrow cells from BALB/c mice (H-2 d ) were transplanted into the B6 mice. Simultaneously, DLI and thymus transplantation from the same donor were carried out. The survival period of the recipient B6 mice were examined, histological studies were performed in the liver, intestine, and the engrafted thymus from the recipients 4 weeks after the BMT. Surface markers on lymphocytes from the spleen were analyzed by 3-color fluorescence staining using a FACScan system to determine chimerism. [Results]. All mice treated with BMT showed fully donor-derived chimerism(H-2 d ). The survival rate in mice treated with BMT plus TT was significantly prolonged compared with those treated with BMT alone or BMT plus DLI. Histologically, both the cortex and medullar areas of the engrafted thymus under the renal capsule were clearly shown. Normal T-cell differentiation was also observed in the engrafted thymus. Microscopic founding of small intestine and liver in the BMT plus TT group indicated mild GVHD, whereas those treated with BMT plus DLI showed moderated to serious GVHD. The number of the CD4 + cells was significantly greater in the mice treated with BMT+TT compared with those with BMT alone or those with BMT + DLI. The percentage of FoxP3 + regulatory T cells among CD4 + cells was higher in the mice treated with BMT + TT comparable to those treated with BMT + DLI. The results for CD8 + T cells were similar to those for CD4 + cells. [Conclusion]. Allo-BMT combined with TT induces high thymopoiesis, and can elicit strong GVL effects with mild GVHD reaction. We thus found that donor-derived T cells play an important role in the treatment of leukemia. Also the details of the mechanisms are still unknown, one possibilities may be the continuous supplementation of T cells from the allogeneic thymus. The results of the present study suggest this strategy will become a new way for the treatment of refractory or relapse leukemia in human. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
