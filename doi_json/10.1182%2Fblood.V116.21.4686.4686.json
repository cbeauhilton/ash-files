    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4686 Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder. A corticosteroid, usually prednisone is often the first line treatment for ITP. However, the problem is that about 70 percent of adult patients experience a relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroids. And approximately 20\u201330% of patients with chronic ITP do not respond to corticosteroids therapy. Rituximab has been proven effective in refractory chronic ITP, but the timing of response is slower than expected, at least three months might be necessary to observe an effect. And the response duration to rituximab remains relatively short in some patients. So, sometimes it is necessary to use combination therapy including rituximab, according to different patient conditions. Here, we report an 82-year-old man with chronic ITP who had thrombocytopenia (platelet count <10 \u00d7 10 9 /L) for more than 6 months and relapsed on a prednisone taper. He presented sustaining blood-tinged sputum, bleeding in skin and steroid-induced diabetes, the result of short-term prednisone. He didn't want splenectomy and other immune suppressive drugs. His blood glucose got control after insulin therapy. We gave the patient intravenous infusions of rituximab 375 mg/m 2 weekly for 4 weeks combined with dexamethasone ( 10 mg intravenously weekly for 4 weeks). After first dose of dexamethasone followed by rituximab, within 24 hours his platelet count had increased to 65 \u00d7 10 9 /L and bleeding symptoms were significantly improved. During the next 3-week period of treatment, his platelet counts fluctuated between 30 \u00d7 10 9 /L and 60 \u00d7 10 9 /L. And then the platelet count dropped back to a minimum of 19 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Consider the slow responses to rituximab and prevention of bleeding, we still gave the patient maintenance therapy with 15mg prednisone daily and he had been no bleeding. Two months after starting rituximab and dexamethasone, his platelet counts began to gradually recover to normal. Although we need to further observe the patients's duration of response, this case suggests that combination therapy of rituximab and corticosteroids may be a promising treatment for refractory chronic ITP.
