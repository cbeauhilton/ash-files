    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5123 Vertebral compression fractures occur in approximately 60% of MM patients and can cause pain, persistent disability and dismail quality of life. Appropriate therapy of MM or radiotherapy can lead to improvement of symptoms in a significant percentage of patients, but these positive effects can take time to be perceived. Vertebral agumentation techniques have been recently proposed as suitable options to relieve bone pain from vertebral compression fractures in patients with benign osteoporosis or neoplastic diseases such as MM. Aim of this study was to analyze the clinical course and outcome of 40 consecutive MM patients (23M, 17F, median age = 67.6yrs) treated in the Centers referring to GER, who underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty from 2006 to 2010. Seventeen patients (43%) were newly diagnosed while 23 patients were relapsed or refractory after 1\u20133 lines of therapy. All the patients were treated because of severe pain, the extent of vertebral fractures was assessed by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Sixty-nine procedures were performed at C2-L5 levels, 51% of the patients were treated at a single level, a maximum of three levels were treated in 6 patients, 13 procedures (32%) were performed at L1 level. Thirty seven patients (92%) experienced reduction of pain, with 55% showing complete disapperance of symptoms prior to any further treatment, 3 patients reported no or little improvement. Responses were durable, after a median follow-up of 14 months no further collapse of the treated vertebrae was observed. After vertebroplasty, first line or salvage therapy was administered to 35 patients, 10 newly diagnosed patients were scheduled to receive autologous stem cell transplant, and peripheral blood stem cell collection was not affected by the procedure. In conclusion, percutaneous vertebroplasty appears to be useful in MM patients with painful vertebral fractures as it allows rapid and durable achievement of pain control, without interfering with further therapeutic programs Work supported in part by RiminiAIL Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
