    "abstract_text": "As therapy for MM improves, methods more sensitive than conventional serum/urine electrophoresis/immunofixation are required to optimally evaluate response. Our phase 2 multi-center clinical trial, conducted in 10 Canadian centers, utilized serial bone marrow aspirate (BMA) samples for MRD analysis by 8-color multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC), along with serum Hevylite assay of the involved heavy light chains (HLC), to assess responses after ASCT and during maintenance therapy. After btz-based induction therapy (usually CyBorD), pts without progression received enhanced conditioning with BuMel (IV busulfan 3.2 mg/kg days -5 to -3 or days -6 to -4 + melphalan 140 mg/m 2 day -2 or day -3) followed by ASCT on day 0. On day 100 post-ASCT, lenalidomide (len) 10 mg/day was commenced, escalated to 15 mg/day after 3 cycles if appropriate, and continued until progression. BMA and serum samples were shipped centrally for MRD and Hevylite analysis before induction therapy, before ASCT, on day 100 post-ASCT, every 3 mos for the 1 st year and every 6 mos until progression. From 03/2013 - 07/2015, 122 newly diagnosed pts provided BMA samples for MRD analysis. To date, 70 pts (target 78), have completed induction therapy and undergone ASCT; 8 others provided pre-induction samples and are expected to be enrolled. 44 of the 122 (36%) who provided BMA samples did not proceed to BuMel due to: poor samples-4 pts (3.2%); MM not confirmed-3 pts (2.5%); prior therapy-1 pt (0.8%); death during induction-1 pt (0.8%); consent withdrawal/opted for standard conditioning-19 pts (15.6%); and no ASCT-16 pts (13.1%; 8 were unfit, 4 had comorbidities, 2 progressed, 1 failed mobilization and 1 received tandem ASCT for high-risk MM). Median follow-up is 17.4 mos (range: 6.3-25.6). Median age is 57 (34-69); 64% are male. Median serum \u03b22-microglobulin level is 3.07 mg/L (1.5-20) and albumin 37 g/L (2.8-48.1); 31 pts have ISS stage I; 18 stage II; 15 stage III MM and 6 have missing data. Ig subtype includes IgG\u03ba in 30 (43%), IgG\u03bb in 14 (20%), IgA\u03ba in 8 (12%), IgA\u03bb in 9 (13%), \u03ba in 5 (7%); \u03bb in 1 (1%) and missing data in 3 pts (4%). Post-ASCT, 14 SAEs have occurred: Grade 3 atrial fibrillation (2), acute kidney injury (3), increased creatinine (1), upper respiratory infection (2), febrile neutropenia (2), bacteremia (1), hypoxia (1) and lung infection (1) and Grade 4 sepsis (1). There have been no ASCT-related deaths; 4 pts have progressed. The best conventional Ig response post-induction in the 66 pts with available data is CR in 5 (7.6%), VGPR in 25 (38%), PR in 31 (47%), MR in 4 (6%) and SD in 1 (1.5%). The Ig response at day 100 in the 60 evaluable pts includes CR in 10 (17%), VGPR in 30 (50%), PR in 18 (30%), MR in 1 (1.5%) and SD in 1 (1.5%). MRD negativity improved from 18/67 (27%) after induction to 22/60 (37%) at day 100 (Table 1). Among evaluable pts, 83.3% of those after induction and 68.2% of those at day 100 who were MRD-negative had normal involved HLC ratios, while 42.6% and 51.5% of those who were MRD-positive, respectively, had normal ratios.
