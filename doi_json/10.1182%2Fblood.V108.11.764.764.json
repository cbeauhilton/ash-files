    "abstract_text": "A mild hemophilia A subject with a missense mutation, A2201P, developed high titer neutralizing antibodies against infused factor VIII (FVIII) following post\u2212operative FVIII administration. This missense mutation is in the C2 domain of FVIII. His baseline clotting activity fell from 10% to 3% of normal; FVIII infusions were discontinued, and his factor VIII clotting activity improved to its baseline within 2 mo. His inhibitor titer to FVIII declined over the ensuing year during which 12 samples were studied for T\u2212cell epitopes, antibody titer, or both. His HLA haplotype was DR0101/DR1503, allowing use of fluorescent\u2212labeled MHC Class II tetramers specific for DR0101. These were loaded with synthetic 20\u2212mer peptides spanning the FVIII C2 domain to identify specific T cells responding to epitopes on FVIII by FACS. Proliferation assays were also carried out stimulating T cells with FVIII, the recombinant wild\u2212type FVIII C2 domain, the C2 domain with mutation A2201P, and peptides. Tetramer staining and proliferation assays of total CD4+ and CD4+CD25\u2212 fractions indicated that CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells modulated his immune response to FVIII between 10 and 19 weeks following the initial bleed. Peptides containing the wild type A2201, but not P2201, elicited strong T\u2212cell responses. Markedly decreased staining of the total CD4 fractions compared to CD4+CD25\u2212 fractions in response to a peptide containing A2201 was observed between weeks 10 and 19 (see Figure showing staining at week 10). T\u2212cell proliferation assays were carried out for cloned, expanded T cells that were selected using the tetramers. These T cell clones proliferated in response to FVIII, wild\u2212type C2 protein, and peptides with the native A2201 sequence, whereas a peptide containing the mutation A2201P abrogated tetramer binding and proliferation. The T\u2212cell epitope corresponded to a predicted MHC Class II binding motif for DR0101, underscoring the importance of studying T\u2212cell responses within the context of each individual\u2019s HLA haplotype. The epitope also overlapped a B\u2212cell epitope identified by peptide mapping of the subject\u2019s anti\u2212FVIII C2 domain IgG fraction. Tetramer\u2212guided T\u2212cell epitope mapping provides greater sensitivity and specificity and markedly less ambiguous information than traditional mapping methods based on proliferation in response to peptides. FACS sorting of stained T cells allowed cloning of single T cells that retained the original specificity for the factor VIII peptides comprising this immunodominant T\u2212cell epitope.
