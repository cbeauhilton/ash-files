    "abstract_text": "Adoptive immunotherapy of human Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia has not been effective due to difficulties of identifying tumor-specific antigens for the disease. It has been reported that T lymphocytes activated by some minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAs) can efficiently treat mice receiving HL4 cells (a leukemia cell line) without causing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We investigated whether this anti-mHA immunotherapeutic strategy is applicable to treating Ph+ leukemia that includes B-ALL (B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and CML (chronic myeloid leukemia). Because the mHA, H60, is an immunodominant mHA among H7, H28, and H58 in mice (Choi et al, Immunity 17:593\u2013603, 2002), we tested whether H60 can serve as an immunotherapeutic target in the treatment of B-ALL and CML in our retroviral bone marrow transduction/transplantation disease models ( Li et al, J Exp Med  189 : 1399 \u20131412, 1999 ). We used C57BL/6-H60 congenic mouse splenocytes to immunize wild type C57BL/6 (B6) mice that do not have the H60 gene, and the activated T lymphocytes from the immunized B6 mice were injected into mice with BCR-ABL-induced B-ALL or CML (3\u00d7107 cells/mouse). We found that H60-specific T lymphocytes at a single dose completely eliminated leukemic cells within 10 days after the injection of the cells and cured B-ALL and CML, however, in mice receiving donor bone marrow cells transduced with empty vector and treated with H60-specific T lymphocytes, the non-BCR-ABL-expressing donor marrow cells lasted for more than 4 weeks, suggesting that H60-activated T lymphocytes have much stronger inhibitory effect on BCR-ABL-expressing leukemic cells than on normal marrow cells. In contrast, leukemia mice receiving nai\u0308ve T lymphocytes died within 3 to 4 weeks post BCR-ABL induction of leukemia. Six months later, no residual leukemia cells were detected in the spleen and bone morrow of the leukemia mice receiving H60-activated T lymphocytes. In addition, no GVHD was observed in the mice. We also use H7/H28/H60 triple congenic B6 mice in our study, and found that H7/H28/H60-primed T lymphocytes were more effective in elimination of leukemia cells in mice compared with when the single H60 antigen was used in similar experiment. Especially, the H7/H28/H60-primed T lymphocytes were highly effective in treating B-ALL mice, and did not induce GVHD. These results indicate that mHAs are promising targets for immunotherapy of BCR-ABL-induced B-ALL and CML."
