    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2319 Introduction Thrombosomes are novel lyophilized human platelet derivatives that retain a number of key platelet structural and functional properties. Building on preliminary in vitro studies, we here sought to investigate whether Thrombosomes , suspended in platelet free plasma (PFP), would enhance and be incorporated in thrombus generated under flow conditions within a validated and well-characterised model of deep arterial injury. Methods PFP was obtained by centrifuging citrated whole blood from six healthy non-smoking volunteers and filtering with a 0.22\u03bcm filter. Thrombosomes were suspended in 60 mL of PFP to generate final concentrations of 20 and 200 \u00d7 10 6 Thrombosomes /mL. Immediately prior to use, 1.2 mL of 1M CaCl 2 was added to permit fibrin generation. Thrombus formation was assessed using the Badimon Chamber at low (212 s \u22121 ) and high (1690 s \u22121 ) shear rates with porcine aortic tunica media as the thrombogenic substrate. Total thrombus area and platelet-rich area were measured histomorphometrically using conventional and immunohistochemical staining respectively. Fluorescent labeled Thrombosomes were added to the extracorporeal circuit in the Badimon chamber to study the ex vivo thrombus generation in the whole blood. Electron microscopy of Thrombosomes and platelets was undertaken. Results Thrombosomes contributed towards thrombus formation in whole human blood as evidenced by incorporation of fluorescent-labeled Thrombosomes into the thrombus. Immunohistochemical staining of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor confirmed incorporation of Thrombosomes into the thrombus. In the high shear chamber, mean thrombus area increased in a dose-dependent manner following the addition of Thrombosomes (704 \u03bcm 2 [95% CI, 224 \u2013 1184 \u03bcm 2 ], 1511 \u03bcm 2 [95% CI, 687 \u2013 2336 \u03bcm 2 ] and 2378 \u03bcm 2 [95% CI, 1567 \u2013 3189 \u03bcm 2 ] for PFP and Thrombosomes at concentrations of 20 and 200 \u00d7 10 6 /mL respectively [P= 0.003]). In the low shear chamber, total thrombus area for the PFP was 4962 \u03bcm 2 (95% CI, 2489 \u2013 7434 \u03bcm 2 ). The addition of Thrombosomes at concentrations of 20 and 200 \u00d7 10 6 /mL led to a numerical increase in mean thrombus area to 6170 \u03bcm 2 (95% CI, 3944 \u2013 8397 \u03bcm 2 ) and 7504 \u03bcm 2 (95% CI, 3864 \u2013 11144 \u03bcm 2 ) respectively, although this was not statistically significant (P= 0.2969). Conclusions Thrombosomes suspended in PFP and exposed to injured arterial tissue under physiologically relevant flow conditions are incorporated into thrombus and enhance thrombus formation in a dose dependent manner. These findings act as impetus to undertake clinical studies of this rehydrated, lyophilized infusible hemostatic platelet product.

On transmission electron microscopy, dense granules and alpha-granules were less distinct than with normal platelets suggesting loss of cytoplasmic architecture and granule integrity.
