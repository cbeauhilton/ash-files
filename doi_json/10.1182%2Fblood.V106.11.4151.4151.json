    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Orgaran \u00ae (Org 10172) is a low molecular weight heparinoid which consists of natural sulphated glycosaminoglycans (heparan, dermatan, chondroitin sulphate). It has a mean molecular weight of approximately 6 kDa (4\u201310 kDa), an excellent bioavailability following subcutaneous administration and an anti-Xa/anti-IIa activity ratio superior to 22. It is the anticoagulant of choice in patients developping Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT), whereas its\u2019 use is also proposed for surgical thromboprophylaxis. Orgaran \u00ae has no effect on routine coagulation tests (aPTT, PT, TT). Thrombin generation test(TG) is a global clotting assay proven to be sensitive to the anticoagulant effect of LMWHs and specific FXa inhibitors (i.e. fondaparinux and BAY-597939). In this in vitro study, we determined the tissue factor (TF)-induced TG inhibition potency of Orgaran \u00ae using the Thrombogram-Thrombinoscope \u00ae assay. Materials and Methods: TG was assessed after TF pathway activation in Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) (1.5x10 5 platelets/\u03bcl) using diluted thromboplastin (Dade Innovin \u00ae , 1:1000 final dilution). The clotting process is provoked by a physiologically relevant TF concentration. Orgaran \u00ae was added to control plasma from 8 healthy volunteers at five different final concentrations (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1IU anti-Xa/ml). TG was initiated by adding the triggering solution containing CaCl 2 and the fluorogenic substrate. The analyzed TG parameters are the lag time, the maximal concentration of thrombin (Cmax), the time to reach Cmax (Tmax), the TG velocity and the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP). Results: Orgaran \u00ae prolonged significantly the lag time and the Tmax at a concentration over 0.40 IU anti-Xa/ml (p<0.05). At the lowest studied concentration (0.20 IU anti-Xa/ml), lag time and Tmax were only prolonged by 12%, whereas their maximal prolongation (around 50%) was observed at 1IU anti-Xa/ml. Furthermore, Orgaran \u00ae inhibited ETP, Cmax and TG velocity in an almost linear dose dependent manner. A significant inhibition of ETP, Cmax and TG velocity was obtained at concentrations superior to 0.20 IU anti-Xa/ml. (p<0.05). At the highest studied concentration (1IU anti-Xa/ml) Orgaran \u00ae suppressed all TG parameters by about 80% (Table 1). Conclusion: Orgaran \u00ae exhibited a significant inhibitory activity of in vitro TG. At concentrations achieved in clinical practice (prophylactic or therapeutic dose), Orgaran \u00ae modified in vitro TG profile while it has no effect on routine coagulation tests. Thus, TG assay is a sensitive method for monitoring Orgaran \u00ae and this test requires a clinical prospective evaluation. Table 1.
