    "abstract_text": "Triptolide, an immunosuppressor isolated from the Chinese herb, Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. F, has recently shown anti-tumor activities in a broad range of solid tumors. We examined its effects on leukemic cells and investigated mechanisms of apoptosis. Triptolide, at less than 100 nM, arrested cell growth and potently induced cell death in myeloid and lymphoid leukemic cells tested, including OCI-AML3, U937, Jurkat, KBM5, and K562 cells. In OCI-AML3 cells, triptolide induced caspase 3 activation, PARP cleavage and annexin V positivity with an IC 50 of about 30 nM, at 24 hrs, all of which were inhibited by a general caspase inhibitor suggesting caspase dependent cell death. However, Triptolide-induced cell growth arrest was not affected by caspase inhibition. Treatment of OCI-AML3 cells with triptolide decreased XIAP and survivin expression, but did not affect Bcl2 and BclX L levels. Forced overexpression of XIAP attenuated Triptolide-induced cell death. Triptolide induced Bid cleavage, but Jurkat cells deficient in caspase 8 were only slightly less sensitive to triptolide than the wild-type counterpart indicating that Triptolide-induced cell death is caspase 8 independent. Jurkat cells deficient in receptor interacting protein (RIP) and therefore deficient in NF\u03baB activation were resistant to Triptolide demonstrating that NF\u03baB signaling is essential for Triptolide-induced cell death. Triptolide treatment induced cytosolic release of cytochrome C and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, overexpression of Bcl2 effectively suppressed apoptosis induced by Triptolide, and caspase 9 knockout MEF cells were resistant to Triptolide suggesting criticality of the mitochondrial pathway. The antioxidants GSH (5 mM) and vitamin C (150 \u03bcM) did not protect from apoptotic cell death induced by Triptolide. In addition, Triptolide-induced apoptosis of blast crisis CML KBM5 cells was independent of their sensitivity or resistance to Imatinib: Triptolide killed Imatinib resistant KBMSTI cells as effectively as Imatinib sensitive KBM5 cells. Ex vivo studies showed that Triptolide also induced cell death in primary AML blasts. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that Triptolide potently induces caspase-dependent apoptosis and arrests cell growth in leukemic cells. Triptolide-induced cell death is dependent on NF\u03baB signaling, and mediated by downregulation of XIAP and survivin through the mitochondrial pathway. The potent anti-leukemic activity of Triptolide in vitro warrants further investigation of this compound for the treatment of leukemia and other malignancies. This drug may also be potentially useful in overcoming Imatinib resistance in CML and Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL.",
