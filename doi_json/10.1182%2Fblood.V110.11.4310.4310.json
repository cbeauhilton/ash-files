    "abstract_text": "Purpose To study the effect of Marsdenia tenacissima injection on NB4 leukemia cells and its mechanisms. Methods After treated with Marsdenia tenacissima, viability of NB4 leukemia cells were determined by trypan blue assay. Cell cycle was assessed by FACS. Cell differentiation were determined by cell morphology, cell surface differentiation antigen and NBT reduction test. Cell cycle and apoptosis associated proteins were measured by western blot. Results Marsdenia tenacissima inhibits the growth of leukemia cells in a dose and time dependent manner. Marsdenia tenacissima induces G0/G1 phase arrest of NB4 cells, accompanied by P21 up-regulation. Marsdenia tenacissima did not change the protein level of PARP and p27. Marsdenia tenacissima could increase the expression of CD11b and percent of NBT positive cells, induces differentiation of NB4 cells. Conclusion Marsdenia tenacissima could inhibit the proliferation of NB4 cells through inducing cell cycle arrest and cell differentiation."
