    "abstract_text": "Introduction. Autologous stem cell transplant is considered the standard of care in young (<70) fit patients with Multiple Myeloma. We know that intensive chemotherapy or stem cell transplant do not produce a cure, but it does prolong event free survival and overall survival. The aim of this study is to report 15 years of experience in stem cell transplant at the Multiple Myeloma (MM) clinic at Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia (INCan). This is a retrospective, observational trial, we reviewed clinical and electronic files of patients that received an autologous stem cell transplant between January 1st of 2005 and March 1 2015. We assessed clinical status, demographic variables, disease status and clinical outcome of the patients that were included in the study. 48 patients were included into the study, 25 males and 23 females, we grouped the patients according to age, 65 years (1 patient). 34 patients had a normal karyotype, 4 had 13q14, 2 had MLL deletion and 8 did not had a karyotype performed. According to the M component we had 6 IgA patients, 32 IgG, 1 IgM, 1 Kappa, 5 lambda, 2 non secretory and 1 combined. According to ISS, 34 patients were assigned a ISS of 1, 10 a SS of 2, and 4 a ISS of 3. The majority of our patients were transplanted within the first line of treatment, 2 within the second line and none with more than 2 lines of treatment. 20 patients that received thalidomide plus dexamethasone achieved complete remission prior to transplant. 14 patients received thalidomide plus dexamethasone achieved very good partial response. 4 patients that received bortezomib plus thalidomide or dexamethasone achieved complete remission prior to transplant. 4 patients received bortezomib plus thalidomide or dexamethasone achieved very good partial response prior to transplant. 3 patients that received two lines of treatment achieved complete remission prior to transplant. 3 patients achieved very good partial response prior to transplant and received more than two lines of treatment. Time from diagnosis to transplant had a mean time of 17.4 months, with 6-12 months as the most prevalent group with 20 patients, followed with 13 patients in the 12-24 months window. 17 tandem transplants were performed. From the 25 patients that received a ASCT and were in CR, 19 maintained that response, from the 23 patients that achieved VGPR 20 maintained that response, 1 achieved partial response (PR), 4 had stable disease, and 4 had progression of the disease. We are looking forward to presenting the full data of our analysis. Since our casuistry does not differ from the international reports. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
