    "abstract_text": "Background: Many patients with SCD require chronic transfusion therapy to manage the complications of their disease (eg stroke prevention); as a consequence, secondary iron overload may develop. Controlled data from patients with SCD receiving long-term iron chelation therapy, particularly renal function, are lacking. Cumulative 3.5-year safety and efficacy data are presented for adult and pediatric patients with SCD with transfusional iron overload treated with deferasirox (Exjade \u00ae ) in a 4-year extension to a 1-year comparative study (109). Methods: Study 109 demonstrated similar dose-dependent liver iron concentration (LIC) reductions with deferasirox and deferoxamine (DFO) in SCD patients with iron overload. Eligible patients entered a 4-year extension phase and received deferasirox only; dose adjustments were based on monthly serum ferritin (SF) levels and safety assessments (adverse events [AEs] and laboratory parameters). Patients with abnormal renal function were excluded. Results: 132 patients (mean age \u00b1 SD of 19.1 \u00b1 10.7 years) who were initially randomized in the core study to receive deferasirox are included in this analysis. The median duration of exposure to deferasirox was 37.4 months (3.1 years) at a mean dose of 18.4 \u00b1 6.2 mg/kg/day. Mean iron intake over this period was 0.3 \u00b1 0.1 mg/kg/day. 72 patients (54.5%) continue to receive deferasirox. Reasons for discontinuations include: AEs (n=11), consent withdrawal (n=24), lost to follow-up (n=9), unsatisfactory therapeutic effect (n=4), and other reasons (n=11). There was also one death reported post-liver transplantation, which was not considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug. The most frequent drug-related (investigator-assessed) AEs were nausea (n=20; 15.2%), diarrhea (n=14; 10.6%), vomiting (n=8; 6.1%) and abdominal pain (n=6; 4.5%). Nine patients (6.8%) had two consecutive increases in serum creatinine that were both >33% above baseline and above the upper limit of normal (ULN); however, there were no progressive increases. Five patients (3.8%) had an increase in alanine aminotransferase >10xULN on at least one visit; baseline levels were already >ULN in two patients. Mean daily dose of deferasirox increased from 15.4 \u00b1 6.9 mg/kg/day at month 1 to 22.3 \u00b1 7.3 mg/kg/day at month 42. Overall baseline median SF level was 3439 ng/mL (n=132), which decreased by 651 ng/mL ( P =0.0533, Wilcoxon signed rank test; n=49) by month 42 (Figure 1). SF decreases were dose-dependent (data not shown). Figure 1. View large Download slide Mean dose and median change in SF during deferasirox treatment Figure 1.
