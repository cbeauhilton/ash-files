    "abstract_text": "Higher rates of graft failure observed after conventional cyclophosphamide (Cy) at 200mg/kg and HLA-matched sibling bone marrow transplant (BMT) for severe aplastic anemia (SAA) in South America prompted the use of a different conditioning regimen: busulfan (Bu) at 12 mg/kg plus Cy at 120 mg/kg. This change was instituted to provide greater immunosuppression for heavily transfused patients (>15 blood transfusion units pre-BMT). We report transplant outcomes in 269 SAA patients who received their HLA-matched BMT at a single center in Brazil between 1990 and 2003. Median age at transplant was 19 years (range 2 \u2013 45). Median time from diagnosis to transplant was 3 months; 78% were transplanted \u2264 6 months from diagnosis, 11%, 7\u201324 months and 11% > 24 months. 128 patients received Cy alone, 2, Cy plus anti-thymocyte globulin and 139, Bu plus Cy. Eighty-one patients (62%) who received Cy conditioning also received \u226415 blood transfusion units and 49 (38%) received >15 blood transfusion units pre- BMT; all patients who received Bu plus Cy conditioning received >15 blood transfusion units. All patients received T-cell replete bone marrow grafts and almost all patients received cyclosporine and short course methotrexate for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. Median follow-up of surviving patients after Cy is 9 years and after Bu plus Cy, 6 years. This reflects the change in practice after 1994, when Bu plus Cy was favored for patients who received >15 blood transfusion units pre-BMT. Most patients achieved neutrophil recovery; the day-60 probabilities of recovery were 95% and 86% after Cy conditioning (\u226415 and >15 blood transfusion units, respectively) and 92% after Bu plus Cy. Corresponding day-100 probabilities of platelet recovery were 95%, 86% and 87%. Thirty-nine patients subsequently lost their graft; failure rates were similar after Bu plus Cy and Cy conditioning in patients who received \u226415 blood transfusion units (13% vs. 17%; RR 0.97, p=0.924). Though failure rates were higher (10 of 42, 24%) after Cy conditioning in patients who received >15 blood transfusion units this did not attain statistical significance when compared to those who received Bu plus Cy (16 of 128, 13%, p=0.077). This may be explained by limited numbers of patients in the heavily transfused Cy group. Younger age (\u226410 years) was the only factor that was associated with higher rates of secondary graft failure (RR 2.91, p=0.001). As expected, the 8-year probability of overall survival was highest (87%) after Cy conditioning in patients who received \u226415 blood transfusion units. Mortality rates were higher after Bu plus Cy conditioning (RR 3.18, p 15 blood transfusion units (RR 4.66, p15 blood transfusion units compared to those who received Cy conditioning and fewer transfusions. Though survival rates are generally lower in patients who receive >15 blood transfusion units, the use of Bu plus Cy appears to confer a survival advantage. Patients with SAA should be referred for transplantation as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed to avoid excess blood transfusion pre-BMT."
