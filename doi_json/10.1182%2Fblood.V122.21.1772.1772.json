    "abstract_text": "A functional BCR is essential for survival of normal B-cells, in response to cognate antigen or tonic, antigen-independent stimuli. Cross-linking of BCR by antigen triggers key phosphorylation events in the early signalosome. Mammalian wild type BRAF, a member of the RAF cytosolic kinase family (A-RAF, B-RAF, C-RAF) is critical to BCR function, mediating RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signal transduction, via phosphorylation of ERK1/2. The MAPK pathway is a central conduit for survival and proliferation. Importantly, use of inducible deletion models have shown that wild type BRAF is the predominant kinase that transduces BCR signals to activate ERK1/2, with C-RAF playing an accessory role and A-RAF displaying a x20-30 fold lower basal activity in ERK1/2 stimulation. Tonic BCR survival signals in normal B-cells are also transduced via phosphorylation of ERK1/2, but do not require antigen stimuli. Whether the BCR plays a comparable role in sustaining survival in malignant B-cells is less well characterized and remains a central question in understanding the origins and progression of mature B-cell neoplasms. Hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) is a rare B cell leukaemia with characteristic hair-like cytoplasmic projections on tumor cells, displaying distinctive activation markers. A striking feature of monoclonal HCL tumors is expression of multiple variant immunoglobulin heavy chain (sIgH) isotypes as components of the BCR on individual tumor cells, defining the major subset of disease (mult-HCL). Most mult-HCL tumors exhibit IGV somatic hypermutation with a low level of on-going mutations and AID expressed, implicating initial contact with antigen via the BCR. The functional relevance of the BCR to transformation and survival however has as yet not been mapped in HCL. Seminal exome sequencing data in typical HCL identified mutant BRAF V(600)E as almost universal in this tumor. Consistent with mutant BRAF V(600)E, levels of phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) are raised in hairy cells. As there is an essential requirement for wild type BRAF in transducing BCR signals, the question arises how mutant BRAF may affect BCR function in HCL, given requirements for dimerization of wild type BRAF for ERK1/2 activation, and whether ERK1/2 activation can be enhanced by functional BCR signals for downstream effector signals in HCL. To examine this, we evaluated BCR signalling in mult-HCL (n=10), in cases uniformly displaying mutated BRAF and IGHV genes. Two apparent functional sets were delineated by IgD co-expression. In sIgD + mult-HCL, IgD mediated persistent Ca 2+ flux, which was also evident via >1 sIgH isotype, linked to increased ERK1/2 activation and BCR endocytosis (4/4 cases). In sIgD -ve mult-HCL however (6/6 cases), BCR-mediated signals activating ERK1/2 for downstream effects were restricted to a single sIgH isotype, with sIgM notably dysfunctional and remaining immobilised on the cell surface. These observations reveal a clear discordance between expression and function of individual isotypes in mult-HCL. In dual sIgL expressing mult-HCL (3/3 cases), only a single sIgL was fully functional. We next examined effects of anti-BCR stimuli on mult-HCL tumor cell survival ex-vivo . Significantly, all functional non-IgD isotypes increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation but triggered apoptosis of tumor cells, in both sets (4/4 cases) to establish a consistent outcome in these replicate cases. IgD stimuli, in marked contrast retained tumor viability with no evidence for pre-apoptotic effects (2 cases; 1 mult-HCL and 1 sIgD only-HCL). Despite mutant BRAF , BCR signals amplify ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but isotype dictates functional downstream outcomes. In mult-HCL lacking IgD, a role for antigen in stimulating the BCR for tumor persistence appears unlikely. It remains feasible that mutant BRAF in these cases retains tonic signals through activated ERK1/2 for survival, but this remains speculative at present. Surface IgD emerges with potential to transduce BCR signals for tumor survival and persistence in-vivo , but given its enigmatic role even in normal B-cells, its relevance to HCL progression is unclear. These observations raise the possibility that mutant BRAF may be a mechanism to bypass any antigen-dependent BCR signalling constraints in mult-HCL.
