    "abstract_text": "Background : The FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion, an imatinib-sensitive molecular target, is detected in a subset of cases with moderate-to-severe eosinophilia (eosinophil count \u22651500/\u03bcL). Using 2 FISH strategies to detect loss of the CHIC2 locus as a surrogate marker of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion, we previously found 14% of cases to be CHIC2 -deleted when studying bone marrow smears from 81 adult patients with moderate-to-severe, non-reactive eosinophilia at our institution ( Blood 2004, 104:3038\u20133045 ). Since then, the FISH test has been made available for routine clinical use both within our institution, and to external physicians as a mail-in test, for the workup of patients with eosinophilic disorders, including systemic mast cell disease (SMCD). Study design : FISH data, subsequent to the test\u2019s introduction into routine clinical practice (from Nov. 2003), were retrospectively analyzed for CHIC2 -deletion. Data from the initial pilot study of 81 patients was not used in this analysis (Table). The imatinib treatment analysis, however, included all CHIC2 -deleted patients treated at our institution, including those from the pilot study (Table). Results : A total of 741 patients were studied in the post-pilot phase. Of these, 20 cases were found to be CHIC2 -deleted, with an overall prevalence of 2.7% (Table). Of the 219 patients seen at our institution, 13 (all male) were found to be CHIC2 -deleted (Table) (prevalence=5.9%), and of these, 10 have been treated with imatinib (100 mg/day starting dose) to date. Nine patients are evaluable for response - all achieved a complete clinical and histological remission (7 patients were tested by FISH post-treatment - all achieved cytogenetic remission). One patient received concomitant corticosteroids for co-morbidities and could not be evaluated for response. After a median follow-up of 24 months (range 17 to 39 months), all 9 patients continue to be in remission, with a normal eosinophil count. At last follow-up, one patient had discontinued imatinib and the others were on maintenance therapy at the following dose: 100mg/wk (n=1), 100mg BIW (n=1), 100mg TIW (n=2), 50mg QOD (n=1), and 100 mg/day (n=3). Conclusions : FIP1L1-PDGFRA prevalence in non-selected patients with eosinophilia is lower than anticipated from prior studies. Patients with FIP1L1-PDGFRA exhibit durable responses to imatinib therapy. It may be feasible to maintain some patients in remission on an empirically derived, intermittent schedule of low-dose imatinib.  . Pilot Data . Post-pilot Data (n=741) . Total . . Mayo samples .
