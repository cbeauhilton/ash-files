    "abstract_text": "Introduction: A growing body of literature has shown a strong and independent association between anemia and poor outcomes in older adults. Approximately one-third of all reported cases lack an obvious cause (i.e., unexplained anemia (UA)). The ongoing CAFE\u0301 study aims to evaluate the impact of anemia correction on Quality of Life (QoL), as measured by the SF-36, in community-dwelling adults 70 years and older with UA. Described here are baseline characteristics from the first 65 subjects. Methods: A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, 24-week blinded study followed by an optional 22-week open-label extension. Participating subjects were anemic, non-dialysis, ambulatory, community-dwelling adults that met at least one criteria of the Frailty Index. Major enrollment criteria required a hemoglobin (Hb) \u2265 9.0 but  30 ml/min/1.73m 2 , and adequate stores of iron, B12 and folate. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to either darbepoetin alfa (DA) starting at 60 mcg Q2W or placebo for 22 weeks. Hb was monitored every two weeks to ensure a rate of rise not to exceed 2 g/dL. QoL was measured by a Geriatric Panel at randomization (baseline) and weeks 10, 24, 36 and 48. QoL and physical function were also measured at baseline, week 12 and week 28. Results: The baseline characteristics (mean \u00b1 SD) are reported in Table 1. The mean Hb was 10.9 g/dL and mean C-reactive protein was 1.4 mg/L. Subjects had a mean serum creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL \u00b1 0.4 g/dL and an estimated GFR of 54.8 \u00b1 21.4 ml/min/1.73m 2 . Inadequate serum erythropoietin (EPO) for the degree of anemia was nearly universal (mean EPO = 19.8 \u00b1 13.9 mU/ml, range = 4\u201327 mU/ml). The mean QoL scores were consistent with those observed in prior observational studies. Table 1. Baseline characteristics of the study patients (n=65)  Demographics . . Hematology . .

The low serum EPO observed suggests that renal endocrine insufficiency may contribute to the pathogenesis of UA and further supports a trial evaluating the impact of DA administration on correction of anemia. The data further show that enrolling frail, community-dwelling, elderly adults having UA in an interventional trial is feasible.",
