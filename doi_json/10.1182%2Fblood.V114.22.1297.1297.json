Then, the diagnostic criteria for non-overt DIC was proposed by ISTH/SSC subcommittee in order to diagnose of early phase DIC but it was still not established. In this study, modified non-overt DIC diagnostic criteria using molecular hemostatic markers and antithrombin (AT) has been prospectively evaluated. Total 613 patients suspected to be associated with DIC in nine institutes were registered in this prospective study for DIC diagnostic criteria from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2008. There were 219 patients with infectious disease, 142 with solid cancer, 115 with hematopoietic tumor, 29 with aneurysm, 10 with obstetrics disease, 23 with trauma, 5 with liver disease, 70 with other disease. Materials and Methods Overt-DIC or non-overt DIC was diagnosed by modified overt-DIC diagnostic criteria or modified non-overt DIC diagnostic criteria using abnormalities or changes of platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen, fibrin and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), AT, soluble fibrin monomer complex (SFMC), D-dimer and thrombin-AT complex (TAT). Pre-DIC was considered the state within a week before onset of DIC. Measurement of PT, fibrinogen, platelet count, FDP were carried out in each institutes based on numerous previous reports. TAT, SFMC, D-dimer and AT activity were measured in SRL Inc. TAT was measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) using. SFMC and D-dimer were measured by latex immune agglutination test using T-test, respectively. AT activity was measured by heparin cofactor activity. Results Frequency of overt-DIC was 29.5 % in 613 patients suspected to be associated with DIC, and the highest frequency of overt-DIC was observed in the patients with obstetrics disease or liver disease. Pre-DIC state was detected in 44 of 613 patients (7.2 %) and the highest frequency of pre-DIC was observed in the patients with hematopoetic tumor (12.2 %). Frequency of non-overt DIC in the patients with overt-DIC, with pre-DIC or without overt-DIC was 97.8 %, 97.7 % or 17.0%, respectively. The mortality of 28 days was the highest in the patients with overt DIC (37.6%), and it was also high in those with non-overt DIC (32.9%) and with pre-DIC (27.3%) in comparison to the patients without overt DIC (15.2%) and those without non-overt DIC (13.8%). Discussion Modified non-overt DIC diagnostic criteria is more sensitive for DIC than overt DIC diagnostic criteria and is related to the outcome. Non overt DIC diagnostic criteria might be able not only to diagnose DIC but also to predict early phase of DIC. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
