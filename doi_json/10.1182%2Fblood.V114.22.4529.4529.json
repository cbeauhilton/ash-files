    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4529 Introduction Age older than 45 years is a recognized independent prognostic factor for patients with Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL), and it is part of the International Prognostic Score (IPS) system. This score system was based on data derived from selected patients included in clinical trials. It is unclear from these studies if age affects primarily disease biology or the ability of older patients to tolerate therapy. Patients and Methods We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive patients with newly diagnosed HL at our institution. Data collected included their IPS and a co-morbidity score (CoM) which includes assessment of co-existing cardiac, hepatic, pulmonary, renal and other morbidities. Results Forty five patients were identified. Twenty nine patients (64%) were younger than 45 years and 16 (35%) were 45 years or older. Patients were treated wit ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and DTIC) chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy, except for 4 patients who were accrued to clinical trials. An IPS of 2 or more was documented in 17% of younger patients as compared to 71% of those older. There was a significant association between age and IPS score (p= 0.001). Similarly, there was a significant association between age and CoM score (p= 0.01). A CoM score of 4 or higher was seen in only 7.6% of the younger population but in 46.6% of the older patients. With a median follow up of 62 months, overall survival is 86 % for the entire population. Overall survival for the younger patients is 93% and for the older 71% (p= 0.01). Five of the six documented deaths occurred in patients 45 years or older, and 4 of these 5 were seen in patients over 60 years of age. Crude death rates for patients <45 (n= 29), 45 to 59 (n= 9) and 60 or older (n= 7) are: 3.4%, 11% and 57% respectively. Conclusions Older patients are more likely to present with high IPS and CoM scores which explain at least in part their poor outcomes. A high mortality rate in patients >60 years underscores the need to explore new therapeutic approaches in the older population. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
