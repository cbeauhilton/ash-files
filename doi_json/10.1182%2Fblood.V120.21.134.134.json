    "abstract_text": "Abstract 134 Background: Asparaginase (ASP) is an essential component in combination chemotherapy for childhood ALL and NHL, as indicated by several randomized trials. However, the optimal number of ASP administrations is still unknown. We conducted a randomized phase III trial comparing conventional E.coli ASP regimen (short-ASP, 12 doses) with prolonged E.coli ASP therapy (long-ASP, 24 doses). Methods: The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Children's Leukemia Group (EORTC-CLG) phase III 58951 trial was open to de novo ALL or NHL patients (pts) < 18 y. This BFM-based study addressed 2 main randomized questions. The first evaluated the value of dexamethasone (DEX, 6mg/m 2 /d) vs prednisolone (PRED, 60mg/m 2 /d) in induction for all pts. In the second question all non-very high risk (VHR) pts were randomized for either short- or long-ASP. All patients had to receive 8\u00d710000 U/m 2 in induction. In the short-ASP arm pts had to receive 4\u00d710000 U/m 2 in late intensification; pts in the long-ASP arm had to receive 8\u00d75000 U/m 2 E.coli ASP injections in consolidation and 8 (4\u00d710000 U/m 2 + 4\u00d75000U/m 2 ) in late intensification. Patients with grade \u22652 allergy to E.coli ASP had to be switched to equivalent doses of Erwinia or PEG ASP. Central randomization was stratified by the 1 st randomized arm, risk group (VLR, AR1, AR2) and center. The primary endpoint of the study was disease-free survival (DFS), secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and toxicity. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Results: Between December 1998 and August 2008, 2038 patients were randomized for the 1 st question and 1552 pts, ALL (n=1481) and NHL (n=71), were randomly assigned to receive long-ASP (n=775) or short-ASP (n=777). At a median follow-up of 7 years there were 97 vs 112 events in the long- vs short-ASP group (see table). The 8-year DFS rate was 87.0% in the long-ASP and 84.2% in short-ASP group (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.87, 95% CI 0.66\u20131.14, 2-sided logrank p=0.30). The 8-year OS rate was comparable in both treatment arms: 92.6% in the long-ASP group and 91.3% in the short-ASP group (HR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.61\u20131.29, 2-sided log rank p=0.53). Similar treatment differences were observed in each risk group, in randomized arm (PRED vs DEX), and B- and T-lineage ALL pts. The incidence of grade 3\u20134 infection was higher in the long- vs short-ASP group during consolidation (25.2% vs 14.5%) and late intensification (22.6% vs 15.9%). This difference was more pronounced in pts who were randomly assigned to DEX (see table). In the long- vs short-ASP group grade 2\u20134 allergy to ASP was 22.5% vs 0.3% in consolidation and 10.3% vs 21.5% in late intensification. During the whole treatment period, the incidence of grade 2\u20134 allergy was 30.5% in the long-ASP arm and 21.7% in the short-ASP arm. In the long- vs short-ASP arm approximately 67% vs 95% pts received at least the total number of E.coli or equivalent ASP administrations as planned according to the treatment arm. Conclusion: At long follow-up (median= 7 yrs) prolonged E.coli asparaginase therapy in consolidation and late intensification for VLR and AR pts did not improve significantly the outcome. Intensive ASP treatment did increase infection rate in consolidation and late intensification and resulted in more grade 2\u20134 allergic reactions. In the future, we aim to improve outcome rates by the use of PEG ASP and monitoring of asparaginase activity and antibody formation.  Endpoint . Long-ASP (N=775) . Short-ASP (N=777) .
