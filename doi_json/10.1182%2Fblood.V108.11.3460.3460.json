    "abstract_text": "Activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2 MAPK) signaling pathway mediates tumor cell growth in many cancers, including human multiple myeloma (MM). Specifically, this pathway mediates MM cell growth and survival induced by cytokines/growth factors (i.e. IL-6, IGF-1, CD40, BAFF) and adhesion to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), thereby conferring resistance to apoptosis in the bone marrow (BM) milieu. In this study, we therefore examined the effect of the MEK1/2 inhibitor AZD6244 (ARRY-142886), on human MM cell lines, freshly isolated patient MM cells and MM cells adhered to BMSCs. AZD6244, inhibits constitutive and cytokine (IL-6, IGF-1, CD40)-stimulated ERK1/2, but not AKT phosphorylation. Importantly, AZD6244 inhibits the proliferation and survival of human MM cell lines, regardless of sensitivity to conventional chemotherapy, as well as freshly isolated patient MM cells. AZD6244 induces apoptosis in patient MM cells even in the presence of BMSCs, as evidenced by caspase 3 activity and PARP cleavage at concentrations as low as 20 nM. AZD6244 overcomes resistance to apoptosis in MM cells conferred by IL-6 and BMSCs, and inhibits IL-6 secretion induced by MM adhesion to BMSCs. AZD6244 suppresses MM cell survival/growth signaling pathways (i.e., STAT3, Bcl-2, cyclin E1, CDK1, CDK3, CDK7, p21/Cdc42/Rac1-activated kinase 1, casein kinase 1e, IRS1, c-maf) and up-regulates proapoptotic cascades (i.e., BAX, BINP3, BIM, BAG1, caspase 3, 8, 6). AZD6244 also upregulates proteins triggering cell cycle arrest (i.e. p16 INK4A , p18 INK4C , p21/WAF1 [Cdkn1a], p27 [kip1], p57). In addition, AZD6244 inhibits adhesion molecule expression in MM cells (i.e. integrin a4 [VLA-4], integrin b7, ICAM-1, ICAM-2, ICAM-3, catenin a1, c-maf) associated with decreased MM adhesion to BMSCs. These pleiotropic proapoptotic, anti-survival, anti-adhesion and -cytokine secretion effects of AZD6244 abrogate BMSC-derived protection of MM cells, thereby sensitizing them to both conventional (dexamethasone) and novel (perifosine, lenalidomide, and bortezomib) therapies. In contrast, AZD6244 has minimal cytotoxicity in BMSCs and does not inhibit DNA synthesis in CD40 ligand-stimulated CD19 expressing B-cells derived from normal donors at concentrations toxic to MM cells (between 0.02\u20132 mM). Furthermore, AZD6244 inhibits the expression/secretion of osteoclast (OC)-activating factors (i.e., macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1a, MIP-1b, IL-1b, VEGF) from MM cells. It also downregulates MM growth and survival factors (IL-6, BAFF, APRIL) in OC cultures derived from MM patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Significantly, AZD6244 inhibits OC differentiation from MM PBMCs (n=10) in a dose-dependent manner. Together these results provide the preclinical basis for clinical trials with AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) in MM.",
