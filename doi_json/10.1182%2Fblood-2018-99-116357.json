The potent ability of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells to kill hematopoietic and solid tumors has attracted great interest for using them as an adoptive cell therapy strategy to treat cancer. It has been extensively reported that V\u03b42 cells, the dominant subpopulation of peripheral \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in human, are easily expanded by aminobisphosphonates (e.g pamidronate) ex vivo . Several clinical trials of V\u03b42 cells-based immunotherapy have been conducted with promising results. Given that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells do not cause graft versus host disease (GvHD), but can exert strong graft-versus leukemia (GvL) effect, this special T-cell population becomes popular for cellular immunotherapy in the context of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). Immunosuppressive drugs are commonly used for conditioning and GvHD prophylaxis and treatment, which could affect the efficacy of adoptive V\u03b42 cells. However, whether the phenotype and function of ex vivo-expanded V\u03b42 cells are influenced by immunosuppressive drugs remains unknown. Our unpublished data implicated that mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) impaired the recovery of V\u03b42 cells after alloHSCT. We next explored the impacts of MMF and cyclosporine A (CsA) on the pamidronate-expanded V\u03b42 T cells. Methods. PBMCs from healthy donors were stimulated with pamidronate in the presence of IL-2 for 10-14 days. The proliferation, differentiation maker, functional receptor expression, and cytotoxic cytokines-production capacity of pamidronate-expanded V\u03b42 cells were determined by Flow Cytometry following 1, 3, and 6 days treatments with mycophenolic acid (MPA, the active form of MMF) and CsA respectively. These experiments were performed in the primary V\u03b42 cells at the same time. Furthermore, the influences of MMF and CsA on the cytotoxic activity of pamidronate-expanded V\u03b42 cells on leukemia cells were investigated using calcein AM pre-staining of target cells. Results. Compared to primary V\u03b42 T cells in PBMCs, pamidronate-expanded V\u03b42 cells exhibited markedly increased expressions of effector cell marker (CD45RO), functional receptor (NKG2D), and cytotoxic cytokines (IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1). Upon treatment with MPA and CsA, we observed that the differentiation status and functional receptor expression of expanded V\u03b42 cells were not significantly changed. Notably, their proliferation and cytokine-production capacity were attenuated differentially by MPA and CsA treatment. It seemed that pamidronate-expanded V\u03b42 T cells were more tolerant to MPA and CsA than primary V\u03b42 T cells, in comparing the reduction degrees of cytotoxic cytokines produced after 1-day of CsA treatment (TNF-\u03b1 13.8% Vs 37.0% , P =0.02; IFN-\u03b3 28.4% Vs 77.2% , P =0.00003), and after 3-day of MPA treatment (IFN-\u03b3 34.1% Vs 89.7% , P =0.02). In addition, the cytotoxic elect of pamidronate-expanded V\u03b42 T cells against K562 cells was moderately impaired after exposure to MPA and CsA. Conclusions. We demonstrated for the first time the influences of MPA and CsA on pamidronate-expanded V\u03b42 T cells. These results indicate that MPA and CsA each has distinct effect on the phenotypes and cytotoxic function of pamidronate-expanded V\u03b42 T cells. It is worth emphasizing that pamidronate-expanded V\u03b42 T cells were more tolerant to MPA and CsA than the primary V\u03b42 T cells, which may have important implications for V\u03b42 cells-based immunotherapy after alloHSCT.
