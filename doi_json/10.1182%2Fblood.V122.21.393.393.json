    "abstract_text": "Background Fedratinib (SAR302503) is a JAK2-selective inhibitor that has provided clinically meaningful reductions in MF-associated splenomegaly and symptoms in Phase I and II studies (J Clin Oncol 2011;29:789. Haematologica 2013;98:S1113). Here, we present efficacy and safety data from the Phase III JAKARTA study of fedratinib versus placebo in patients with MF (NCT01437787). Methods In this international double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm study, patients aged \u226518 years with IPSS intermediate-2 or high-risk MF, platelet count \u226550 \u00d7 10 9 /L, and splenomegaly were randomized (1:1:1) to receive placebo or fedratinib 400 mg or 500 mg, orally, once daily, in consecutive 4-week cycles. Patients who received placebo were eligible to cross-over to fedratinib (randomized 1:1 to 400 mg or 500 mg) following 6 cycles of treatment, or prior to Cycle 6 if the patient had disease progression. The primary endpoint was spleen response rate (RR) (\u226535% reduction in spleen volume from baseline measured by MRI or CT at Week 24, and confirmed 4 weeks later). Secondary endpoints included symptom RR (\u226550% reduction in total symptom score from baseline at Week 24, measured through a daily electronic eDiary using the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form [Cancer 2011;117:4869. Blood 2011;118:401]), and safety of fedratinib. Results A total of 289 patients were randomized: median age 65 years; 59% male; 63% primary MF; 48% high-risk MF; 67% JAK2 V617F positive; 16% platelet count <100 \u00d7 10 9 /L; median baseline spleen volume 2568 mL (range 316\u20138244); median baseline total symptom score 14.7 (0\u201357). Median (range) exposures for placebo, 400 mg and 500 mg groups were 24 (2\u201334), 30 (1\u201355) and 28 (1\u201360) weeks, respectively. Spleen RRs at Week 24 (placebo 1%; 400 mg 47%; 500 mg 49%), and confirmed at Week 28 (placebo 1%; 400 mg 36%; 500 mg 40%), were significantly (p<0.0001) higher in both fedratinib groups compared with placebo ( Table ). Nineteen patients had a spleen response at Week 24 not confirmed 4 weeks later (spleen reduction 25\u201335% [n=10]; image not available/evaluable [n=8]; image taken outside time window [n=1]). Spleen RRs by baseline platelet level are shown in the table. Patients treated with fedratinib had significantly (p<0.0001) greater improvements in MF symptoms compared with placebo ( Table ).

View Large The most common all grade non-hematologic treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was diarrhea (16%, 66% and 56% of patients in the placebo, 400 mg and 500 mg groups, respectively). Grade 3/4 diarrhea was reported in 5% of patients in both the 400 mg and 500 mg dose groups. The most common hematologic TEAE was anemia (any grade 91%, 99% and 98%; Grade 3/4 25%, 43% and 60% in the placebo, 400 mg and 500 mg groups, respectively). Rates of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia were 9% (placebo), 17% (400 mg), and 27% (500 mg). Incidences of Grade 3/4 liver function tests (placebo/400 mg/500 mg) were: bilirubin, 2%/2%/1%; ALT, 0%/3%/3%; and AST, 1%/2%/2%. Overall treatment discontinuation rates up to 24 weeks of treatment were 25% (placebo), 22% (400 mg) and 32% (500 mg). Twenty-five patients died during the study (10, 5 and 10 in the placebo, 400 mg and 500 mg groups, respectively); the most common causes of death: disease progression (placebo [n=5]; 400 mg [n=3]; 500 mg [n=4]) and adverse events (placebo [n=4]; 400 mg [n=1]; 500 mg [n=4]). Conclusions In this Phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled, 3-arm study of 289 MF patients, treatment with fedratinib 400 mg or 500 mg once-daily demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in splenic volume and MF-associated symptom burden versus placebo. Fedratinib had an acceptable safety profile, with the adverse events reported consistent with those observed in previous studies. This study was sponsored by Sanofi.
