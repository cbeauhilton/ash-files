    "abstract_text": "Objiective To explore feasibility and efficacy of unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (UD-PBSCT) in treatment of hematologic malignancies. Methods Ten patients with hematologic malignancies undewent high resolution DNA based typing HLA-matched or 1 locus mismatched UD-PBSCT. Busulfan, cyclophosphamide, Ara-C, MeCCNU and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) were used for preparative regimen in all cases. All patients received mycophenolate mofetile, cyclosporin A and short-term methotrexate with CD25 antibody as the graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Results The results showed that rapid engraftment was observed in all cases who presented full donor chimerism at 28 days post transplantation by STR-PCR. The median time of neutrophil recovery >0.5\u00d710 9 /L, platelet recovery >20\u00d710 9 /L was observed at 13, 17.5days respectively post transplantation. The incidence of acute GVHD was 3/10 cases (1case with grade I was recovery by himself, 1case with grade III was cured, 1case with grade VI was died). Conclusion It is concluded that above-mentioned conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis are effective approaches for unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in treatment of hematopoietic malignancies."
