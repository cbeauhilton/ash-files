    "abstract_text": "Purpose We report the outcomes of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for the patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph + ALL) in a single center. Patients and Methods Between August 1993 and March 2005, 36 patients with Ph + ALL received SCT at Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital. The median age was 41 years (range; 17 to 60 years). All patients received myeloablative conditioning regimen (cytosine arabinoside, cyclophosphamide and fractionated 12Gy total-body irradiation). Stem cell source of SCT was 14 related donors (bone marrow [n=9] and peripheral blood stem cell [n=5]) and 22 unrelated donors (bone marrow [n=13] and cord blood [n=9]). Results Seventeen (47%) of 36 patients are alive at a median of 2.16 years (range; 1.0 to 3.3 years) after transplantation. Three years overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) for all patients are 42.3% and 35.4%, respectively. Three years OS and DFS are 55.4% and 46.4% for the 24 patients in complete remission (CR) at transplantation, while 36.4% (p<0.001) and 16.7% (p<0.01) for the 12 patients in non-CR, respectively. Stem cell source and patients age do not affect the outcomes. The higher white blood cell counts at diagnosis are associated with poor OS (p=0.003). The median duration from diagnosis to SCT is 7 months (range; 3 to 29 months). Three years OS of the patients who received SCT within 7 months from diagnosis is better than that of the others (59.3% vs. 31.1%, p=0.019). Conclusion This analysis suggests that shorter duration between diagnosis and transplantation improve the clinical outcomes of SCT for Ph + ALL, especially performed in CR.",
