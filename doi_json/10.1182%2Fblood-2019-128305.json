    "abstract_text": "Background The B cell receptor (BCR) is a signaling complex composed of surface immunoglobulin and heterodimer subunits, Ig\u03b1 (CD79a) and Ig\u03b2 (CD79b) (Sanchez, et al. 1993). Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) demonstrates dim surface staining of CD79b compared to normal B cells or other B cell malignancies, in part due to overexpression of a splice variant that lacks coding for the extracellular domain (Alfarano, et al. 1999; Cabezudo, et al. 1999). Aggressive lymphomas, like diffuse large B cell lymphomas of non-germinal center origin (DLBCL-ABC), overexpress surface CD79b and can harbor gain of function mutations (Schmitz, et al. 2018). Richter's transformation (RT), a complication of CLL is defined by transformation to a DLBCL-ABC subtype most commonly. Upon transformation outcomes are poor and survival is short with standard therapeutic approaches. Polatuzumab vedotin (Pv), an antibody drug conjugate, targets CD79b on the surface and has obtained FDA approval for relapsed DLBCL in combination with bendamustine and rituximab. Targeting CD79b may represent an attractive therapeutic strategy for patients (pts) with RT. To this end we sought to characterize CD79b expression in RT. Methods Pts with CLL or RT and available paraffin embedded tissue blocks were identified in coordination with Weill Cornell Medicine's (WCM) pathology department. Clone AT107-2 (Bio-Rad, USA) which targets an intracellular epitope was used to stain for CD79b in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections after optimization following institutional staining procedures. CD79b was classified as either positive (pos) or negative (neg) based on staining pattern and intensity as deemed by a board certified hematopathologist. RT pt derived xenografts (RT-PDXs) were assessed for surface expression of CD79b via flow cytometry. Nonpermabilized cells derived from RT-PDXs were stained using an anti-human CD79b-FITC conjugated antibody (clone CD3-1, Southern Biotech, USA). Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was established. RNA seq data was obtained from 2 of 3 RT-PDX models and has been reported previously (Vaisitti, et al. 2018). CD79b transcripts per million (TPM) were analyzed and compared to that of normal lymph node (LN) tissue deposited in the Human Protein Atlas RNA Seq database (HPA-RNA Seq). GraphPad Prism 8.0 was used to perform statistical analysis. Results Nineteen pts with RT and 5 pts with CLL were identified for the study. Median age at diagnosis of the 19 RT pts was 71 years compared to 67 years for the 5 CLL pts. Five RT pts (26%) were treatment na\u00efve (TN) at time of RT. Ten (53%) RT pts transformed on targeted therapy, 6 on BTK inhibitors, 2 on IMiD based therapy, 2 on venetoclax. CD79b stained pos for 16 RT pts (84%) and all 5 (100%) CLL pts. We were not able to identify any correlations between CD79b expression due to low numbers of neg cases. Surface expression of CD79b was evaluated on RT-PDX models from different passages and found to be pos in all 3 models with a median percentage of CD79b+ cells of 45.9% (range 34.6-76%). The median MFI was 2028.5 (range MFI 860-4289). Two of the 3 three models had bimodal populations of cells (pos and neg) whereas the third model was more uniformly pos. RNA seq data from 2 RT-PDX models was available and compared to RNA-seq data from normal LN tissue deposited in the HPA-RNA Seq database. The mean TPM of CD79b for RT-PDX cases was 837.5 compared to 311.5 for normal LN tissue, p=0.028. Conclusion CD79b expression was pos in 84% of FFPE primary RT specimens evaluated. We were able to confirm extracellular CD79b expression with flow cytometry in all 3 RT-PDX models with a median MFI of 2028.5. Surface expression was found to be bimodal in 2 models and uniformly pos in 1 model suggesting tumor heterogeneity. Rna-seq data from RT-PDX models demonstrated higher TPM values in RT-PDX samples compared to normal LN tissue. We conclude that RT expresses CD79b at sufficient levels despite deriving from a CLL cell that historically has demonstrated low surface CD79b expression. Further studies will be undertaken characterizing pos and neg cellular populations focusing on mechanisms of expression and potential differences in splice variant expression.
