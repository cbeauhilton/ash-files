    "abstract_text": "Individuals with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminant potential (CHIP) are healthy, however they are at an increased risk of developing hematopoietic malignancies. The most frequent mutations in CHIP target DNMT3A and TET2 , also are observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). These findings indicate that additional alterations are needed for the transition from a pre-leukemic stage to frank leukemia, although the identity of such molecular events remains uncharacterized. To identify cellular states that cooperate with Tet2 loss, we used in vivo RNAi screening and identified the ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 required for malignant transformation of pre-leukemic TET2 -deficient hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC). Importantly, TRAF6 expression is significantly reduced in 25-50% of AML and MPN patients as compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, TET2 mutations are more strongly correlated with lower expression of TRAF6 as compared to patients with higher TRAF6 expression in certain subsets of AML. To evaluate the consequences of TRAF6 deletion on TET2 -deficienct pre-leukemic cells, we generated mice in which TRAF6 and TET2 are conditionally deleted in hematopoietic cells ( VavCre;Traf6 fl/fl ;Tet2 fl/fl [DKO]). Traf6 KO mice developed a lethal phenotype with signs of MPN, including lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and increased hemoglobin levels; however, this disease was not transplantable. In striking contrast, deletion of TRAF6 in the context of TET2 -deficient HSPC resulted in a rapid, penetrant, aggressive, and transplantable MPN/AML. To firmly establish that TRAF6 exhibits tumor suppressor functions, we determined whether physiological levels of TRAF6 overexpression could prevent malignant transformation. Overexpression of TRAF6 in FLT3 -ITD mice inhibited malignant myeloid cell expansion in FLT3 -ITD mice, and rescued the survival of the animals. To uncover the molecular basis of TRAF6's tumor suppressor function, we performed gene expression profiling and proteomic characterization of TRAF6 ubiquitination substrates in leukemic cells. RNA-sequencing of HSPC revealed that deletion of TRAF6 resulted in a significant overexpression of MYC regulated genes in pre-leukemic HSPC. In support of these findings, the proteomic screen along with extensive in vitro validation experiments identified MYC as a substrate of TRAF6. Unlike the majority of reported ubiquitin-dependent post-translational modifications of MYC, we found that ubiquitination of MYC on Lysine (K) 148 by TRAF6 does not affect its protein stability but rather antagonizes acetylation of MYC on the same lysine and thus suppresses MYC oncogenic activity. We extended these observations to investigate whether inflammatory signaling via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can antagonize MYC function and suppress leukemic cells. Stimulation of TLRs on leukemic cells resulted in TRAF6-dependent ubiquitination of MYC at K148, which coincided with repositioning of MYC off of its target gene promoters and enhancers, and ultimately in the suppression of leukemic cell viability. Our results demonstrate that TRAF6 functions as a tumor suppressor via its ubiquitination activity that antagonizes K148 acetylation leading to a decrease of MYC transcriptional activity without affecting its protein abundance. Our findings identify TRAF6 as a novel, context-dependent tumor suppressor in myeloid neoplasms, and suggest that innate immune signaling via TLR/TRAF6 could explain why some of the clonal hematopoiesis patients develop AML and others do not.
