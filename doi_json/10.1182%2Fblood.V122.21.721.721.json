    "abstract_text": "Introduction Although allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an expensive modality of treatment for hematological disorders, very little is known about the financial burden for the patients themselves. We analyzed factors associated with financial burden and its impact on health behaviors of allogeneic HCT recipients. Patients and Methods A questionnaire was mailed to adult patients who were alive after allogeneic HCT performed between 1/06 to 6/12 at Mayo Clinic to collect information regarding financial concerns, household income, employment status, insurance, out-of-pocket expenses and health and functional status. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with financial hardship. Results Of 482 patients, 268 responded (response rate 56%). Respondents were more likely to be older and Non-Hispanic Whites. No significant differences were seen in disease or transplant characteristics between the two groups except that respondents were more likely to have received reduced intensity conditioning. Median follow-up after HCT was 2.3 years (range 0.7-6.7 years). All the patients for whom the insurance information was available (missing n=13) were insured. Median physical and mental component score, as derived from the SF-12, were 36.8 [Interquartile range (IQR) 29.3-49.0] and 53.1 (IQR 42.1-57.1) respectively, where the general population score is 50, and lower scores indicate worse functioning. The proportion of patients that reported being on medical disability increased from 8% prior to HCT to 29% after HCT. 73% of the respondents reported that being sick had hurt them financially. 54% experienced adverse financial consequences such as decrease in household income by >50% due to the HCT, need to sell/mortgage home, withdraw money from retirement accounts or having to pay more for medical care than they could afford. 3% declared bankruptcy. 12% had out-of pocket costs for the past 3 months that were> $5000. Median monthly medication copayments were $100 (range $ 0-3000). 36% patients felt that their insurance coverage was poor which was strongly correlated with adverse financial consequences (p=0.0013). Other risk factors for financial burden were poor physical functioning reflected by the physical component score <40 (OR 3.2; p=0.005), lower household income (OR 3.08; p=0.006) and lack of commercial/private insurance (OR 4.2; p<0.001) while adjusting for patient and transplant related characteristics. Time from transplant was a significant predictor (OR 1.2; p=0.03) in the univariate analysis, but lost its significance in the multivariate analysis. 18 to 27% patients reported deleterious health behaviors due to financial constraints such as not taking prescribed medications, not using a recommended medical service or not making physician appointments. Conclusions A significant proportion of allogeneic HCT survivors experience adverse financial consequences with a few reporting severe outcomes like bankruptcy, despite having health insurance coverage. Future research should investigate potential interventions such as early financial counseling and connecting with sources of financial support to help at-risk patients and prevent long-term adverse financial outcomes after this life-saving procedure.
