    "abstract_text": "High Mobility Group Box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear DNA-binding protein acting as a proinflammatory cytokine when released in the extracellular space from necrotic cells, activated macrophages and dendritic cells. HMGB1 acts on a specific receptor, RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end-products), and induces prolonged inflammation, organ failure, septicaemia and death. The aim of the study was to determine the diagnostic value of plasma HMGB1 concentration and its role in the development of organ failure in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Plasma HMGB-1 levels were measured in patients with suspected DIC by ELISA and their relationships with DIC, organ failure and clinical outcome were determined. The study group included 201 patients suspected of having DIC (79 females and 122 males, age; 52.1\u00b116.5 years, mean\u00b1SD). The study group represented all such patients admitted to the Second Department of Internal Medicine and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Mie University Hospital between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2003. The underlying diseases were infectious diseases (n=40), hematopoietic diseases (n=58), solid cancers (n=16), trauma (n=21), aneurysm (n=12), autoimmune diseases (n=8), liver diseases (n=7), post-operation (n=32) and other diseases (n=7). Results: Plasma HMGB1 was below the detection limit in normal subjects, but moderately elevated in patients with infectious diseases (4.54 \u00b1 8.18 ng/ml, mean\u00b1SD), malignancies (2.15 \u00b1 5.34 ng/ml), and traumas (6.47 \u00b1 13.13 ng/ml). DIC was associated with significantly high plasma HMGB1 (14.05 \u00b1 12.56 ng/ml) in these patients. The highest HMGBI levels were in patients with organ failure (8.29 \u00b1 10.99 ng/ml) and non-survivors (16.58 \u00b1 11.01 ng/ml). HMGB1 plasma levels correlated with the DIC score and sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. Plasma levels of HMGB1 were significantly higher in patients with PAI-I of >50 ng/ml (3.66 \u00b1 6.36 ng/ml) than in those with PAI-I 1.5 (3.04 \u00b1 5,56 ng/ml) and those with less than 1.5 pg/ml (2.44 \u00b1 5.36 ng/ml). Our data suggest that HMGB-1 is a potentially suitable prognostic marker of OF or DIC.",
