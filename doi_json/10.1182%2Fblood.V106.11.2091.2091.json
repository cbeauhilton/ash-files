    "abstract_text": "Purpose: to identify prognostic factors in pts with relapsing/refractory HD treated with IGEV CT and HDT Methods: From 01/98 to 01/05 104 patients (pts) from our institutions with relapsed/refractory HD received 4 induction cycles of IGEV (ifosfamide 2000 mg/mq d 1\u20134; gemcitabine 800 mg/mq d 1& 4; vinorelbine 20 mg/mq d 1; prednisolone 100 mg/mq d 1\u20134, and G-CSF) and HDT consolidation. Prognostic factors for freedom for progression (FFP) were analyzed by means of the chi-square and Fisher\u2019s exact tests. Multivariate regression logistic analysis was then applied for variable associated with outcome. Results: Main pt characteristics at accrual: M/F 56/48, median age 31 (range 17\u201365), refractory/relapsed following last CT course 40/64, median previous CT regimens: 1 (range 1\u20132), simptoms A/B 32/71, Hasenclever (IPS) score  1: 68/35, previous radiotherapy (RT) yes/no: 62/42. After induction, 45 pts (43%) obtained complete remission (CR), 41(40%) partial remission (PR) and18 (17)% di not response (NR). Overall 89 pts received HDT and at the end of the treatment program 76 out of 104 pts were in CR. On an intent-to treat analysis, two-year freedom from progression (FFP) and overall survival (OS) for the whole series were 47% and 74,6%, respectively. In univariate analysis FFP was negatively influenced by B symptoms, IPS score \u2265 4, LDH ratio > 1, refractory disease, and by response to IGEV (see table). Multivariate analysis revealed that factors retaining statistical significance were refractory disease, B symptoms, high IPS score and chemoresistance (see table). Conclusions: based on this analysis, a prognostic model for IGEV-treated patients with refractory/relapsed HD can be constructed. Factors influencing FFP  Factor \u2265 .
