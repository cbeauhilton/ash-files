    "abstract_text": "Currently, most multiple myeloma (MM) patients experience relapse and develop resistance to standard treatments. A recent study showed that patients who relapsed had poor outcomes, with an overall survival of only 6 months and an event-free survival of 1 month. The PI3K/mTOR/AKT pathway represents a critical target in MM because it stimulates proliferation, survival, and drug resistance of MM cells. VS-5584 is a novel agent, with specific and equipotent activity against mTOR and all 4 Class I PI3K isoforms, without relevant activity on 400 other lipid and protein kinases. Here we report that VS-5584 is highly efficacious against a wide panel of MM cells including Velcade- and Doxorubucin- resistant cell lines. This efficacy is maintained even in the presence of additional MM growth factors, IL-6 and IGF-1, and seems independent of PTEN status in the cell lines. Importantly, VS-5584 shows similar efficacy in patient myeloma cells and preferential tumor cell targeting compared to healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Further testing in a myeloma xenograft mouse model further confirmed the potency of this compound in vivo. We have also observed synergistic activity in combination with both MM clinical therapeutic Dexamethasone, and novel anti-MM candidate Panabinostat. Comparing the basal expression profile of hypersensitive (H929) vs less sensitive (OPM2, U266) cell lines have identified the interferon alpha/beta pathway as a marker for association with sensitivity. Just recently, VS-5584 has been reported to evidence very favourable pharmaceutical and pharmacological properties in a wide range of solid tumors resistant to standard care therapies. Taken together with our data, this offers a compelling rationale for its clinical development as a single or combination therapy in multiple myeloma.
