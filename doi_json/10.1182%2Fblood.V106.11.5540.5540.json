    "abstract_text": "Background: Only patients with breast cancers expressing high levels of Her2 benefit from anti- Her2 monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab. In the present study we investigated in vitro, if chimeric T-cell receptors (TCR), which combine the antigen-specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the effector function of T cells can overcome this limitation. Material and Methods: T cells from healthy donors were transduced with retroviral vectors containing the Her2 -specific chimeric TCR gene with a CD28- zeta signaling domain ( Her2 -CD28- zeta ). The specificity of the genetically modified T cells was determined by their ability 1) to kill breast cancer cell lines in cytoxicity assays, and 2) to proliferate and secrete cytokines (IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2) after stimulation with breast cancer cell lines. The following panel of cell lines was used: autologous PHA blasts, MDA-MB-468 (both Her2- negative), MCF-7 ( Her2- low), Her218 and SKBR-3 (both Her2- high). Results: Her2 -CD28- zeta expressing T cells killed low and high Her2- positive breast cancer cell lines in cytotoxicity assays, where as Her2- negative T cells were not killed. Stimulation of T cells with breast cancer cell lines expressing both high and low levels of Her2 resulted in T-cell proliferation and secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 in a HER2 dependent manner. Discussion: We demonstrate that breast cancer cells with low levels of expression of Her2 can effectively activate T cells expressing Her2 -specific chimeric T cell receptor, induce T-cell proliferation, and the production of IL-2, an important T-cell growth factor. These results indicate that T cells expressing chimeric TCRs could possibly extend the application of Her2 targeted therapies to malignancies expressing low levels of Her2 .",
