    "abstract_text": "Point mutations within the ABL kinase domain are the most frequent mechanism for reactivation of kinase activity of the BCR-ABL gene and have been associated with clinical resistance to tyrosine kinases (TK) inhibitors in CML patients conferring in some of them a poor prognosis. The T315I (Treonine \u2192 Isoleucine) is a mutation described in exon 6 of BCR-ABL gene that makes the protein resistant to all kinase inhibitors most currently used for treating CML (imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib). D-HPLC allows for high throughput mutation screening. This technique is based on heteroduplex formation by PCR products amplified from wild type and mutant alleles. Under optimized denaturing conditions, these heteroduplexes can be distinguished from homoduplex. In this study we screened mutations in exon 6 of BCR-ABL gene in patients treated with kinase inhibitors, in different phases of the disease. We evaluated 85 patients: 9 at diagnosis, 81 in chronic phase, 3 in accelerated phase, one in blast crisis. Thirty four were resistant to imatinib, 10 of them to dasatinib and three had suboptimal response to imatinib. In 9 of 85 (10,5%) samples, D-HPLC showed an abnormal elution profile suggesting the presence of nucleotide changes. Automated sequencing confirmed the presence of two point mutations: T315I (two patients) and F359V (two patients). Five patients requires sequencing confirmation. Patients with T315I mutation failed to imatinib and dasatinib. One of them relapsed after bone marrow transplantation in blast crisis. Patients with F359V mutation were resistant to imatinib. One of them has partial hematological response with dasatinib and the other is in complete molecular response after bone marrow transplantation. D-HPLC seems to be a ship and practical method for routine clinical monitoring for emergence of kinase domain mutations and may be useful for optimizing therapy in CML. Early detection of emerging mutant clones may help in decision-making of alternative treatment.",
