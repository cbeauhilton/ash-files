    "abstract_text": "Abstract 764 Introduction The role of additional radiotherapy after chemotherapy for advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma is unclear. The German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) thus performed the HD15 trial in which advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma patients having residual disease after 6\u20138 cycles of BEACOPP were evaluated by 18 F-fluorodesoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) following chemotherapy. Methods Entry criteria for the PET question in HD15 were partial remission (PR) after the end of chemotherapy with at least one involved nodal site measuring more than 2.5 cm in diameter by computed tomography (CT). Exclusion criteria included diabetes, elevated blood sugar levels and skeletal involvement with risk of instability. Calculations were restricted to those cases with either progressive disease (PD) or relapse within 12 months after PET or at least 12 months of follow-up. A total of 2,137 patients with de novo HL were included in HD15 of whom 728 had a tumor bulk \u2265 2.5 cm after BEACOPP chemotherapy and were qualified for the PET question. An expert panel performed the assessment of response and PET. Only PET-positive patients were scheduled for radiotherapy of residual disease. The negative prognostic value (NPV) of PET was defined as the proportion of PET-negative patients without progression, relapse or radiotherapy despite being PET-negative within 12 months. Results The full analysis set included 728 patients of whom 699 had at least 12 months of follow-up. Median age was 30 years, 57% were males and 66% had NS histology. Of the 728 qualified patients with residual disease \u2265 2.5 cm after BEACOPP, 74.2% were PET-negative and 25.8% PET-positive. In the PET-negative group, a total of 28 patients relapsed or had radiotherapy despite being PET-negative (8 patients including 1 relapsing patient) resulting in a negative prognostic value of 94.6% (95% CI 92.7% to 96.6%). With a median follow-up of 38 months, the time-to-progression after PET at 3 years was 92.1% for PET-negative patients counting radiotherapy as failure and 86.1% for PET-positive patients (95%-CI for difference -11.9% to -0.1%). Overall, only 11% of patients had additional radiotherapy as compared to 71% after BEACOPP escalated in our prior HD9 trial. In addition, there was no difference in PFS or overall survival as compared to our earlier trials in advanced-stage HL. Discussion The NPV of PET of 0.95 suggests that indeed only patients with residual disease after chemotherapy who are PET-positive need additional radiotherapy. PET-negative patients at least after BEACOPP can be spared from additional radiotherapy. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
