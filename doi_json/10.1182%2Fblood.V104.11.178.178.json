    "abstract_text": "The clinical course of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) differs significantly between patients with mutated (M-CLL) and unmutated (U-CLL) immunoglobulin V genes, implying a role for B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling in the pathogenesis of this disease. BCR stimulation in normal B-cells triggers several crucial signaling pathways, including PI3K/Akt, IKK/NF- \u03baB and the mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk, JNK and p38 MAPK, which can induce proliferation, survival, differentiation or apoptosis, depending on the nature and context of the antigenic stimulation. We have now investigated activation of these downstream signaling pathways, as well as induction of anti-apoptotic proteins and survival of CLL B-cells stimulated with soluble (sol-IgM) and immobilized (imm-IgM) anti-IgM antibodies, which were used to mimic stimulation with soluble and particulate/membrane-bound antigen, respectively. Stimulation with sol-IgM revealed similar activation patterns in the 10 U-CLL and 12 M-CLL cases that partially resembled the pattern described for tolerant B-cells. The response in the U-CLL cases was characterized by transient (<45 minutes) phosphorylation of Akt and Erk, no activation of JNK and p38 MAPK, and activation of IKK\u03b2 in 50% of the cases. Most M-CLL cases showed similar activation of Akt and Erk, but lacked activation of IKK\u03b2, whereas three M-CLL cases were completely non-responsive. To investigate the effects on CLL B-cell survival, 14 U-CLL and 19 M-CLL cases were analyzed by Annexin V/PI staining after 48 hours stimulation with sol-IgM. A 10\u201340% increase in apoptotic cells was observed in the majority of cases from both CLL subsets (p<0.001 with respect to spontaneous apoptosis). Induction of apoptosis was confirmed by analyzing cleavage of the Caspase 3 substrate PARP, and was accompanied by an approximately 50% reduction in the levels of Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic protein implicated in CLL B-cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy. A markedly different response was induced by imm-IgM, which was characterized by activation of IKK\u03b2 in all cases and sustained Akt and Erk phosphorylation that persisted over 24 hours. This response resulted in a 2.5 fold mean increase in the levels of Mcl-1, whereas no changes were observed in the levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Imm-IgM slightly reduced the percentage of cells undergoing spontaneous apoptosis after 48 hours, but significantly protected from fludarabine- and methylprednisolone-induced apoptosis. To investigate which of the three imm-IgM activated pathways is responsible for induction of Mcl-1 and protection from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, we incubated CLL B-cells with LY294002, U0126 and BAY-11 (inhibitors of PI3K, ERK and NF- \u03baB, respectively) prior to stimulation with imm-IgM and addition of fludarabine. Induction of Mcl-1 and inhibition of fludarabine-induced PARP cleavage were significantly abrogated only by LY294002, indicating that the PI3K/Akt pathway is the major link between the BCR and apoptosis resistance of CLL B-cells. In conclusion, this study shows that the response of CLL B-cells to BCR stimulation primarily depends on the nature of the antigenic stimulus. Moreover, it shows that only sustained BCR signaling can promote survival of CLL B-cells, and raises the possibility that the distinct clinical and biological behavior of U-CLL and M-CLL is determined by the availability of such stimulation.",
