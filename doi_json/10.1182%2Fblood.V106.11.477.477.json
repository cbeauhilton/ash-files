Reconstitution of immunity by CMV specific immunotherapy is an attractive alternative to drugs currently used, which show high toxicity and are sometimes ineffective. It has been demonstrated that CD4 helper T-cell function is crucial for the persistence of in vivo transferred CD8 CMV-specific CTL. Based on this finding, we have explored the feasibility of generating both anti-CMV CD4 and anti-CMV CD8 T-cell lines. METHODS: Dendritic Cells (DC) were generated from donor peripheral blood (PB) monocytes after a 7-day culture in the presence of GM-CSF plus IL-4 and matured with TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL1-\u03b2, POLI I:C. Matured-DC were then pulsed with a pool of 50 peptides spanning pp65 and IE1 proteins which are recognised by both CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes. Donor T cells were stimulated three times at a T cell/DC ratio of 1:6 on day 0, +7 and +14 with mature peptide pulsed-DC. At the end of the culture the specificity of generated T cells was determined as percentage of pentamer-positive cells and intracellular IFN-\u03b3 production after incubation with peptide pulsed-DC. Cultured T cells were also analysed for their ability to proliferate in response to peptide pulsed-target cells, to kill them in a standard citotoxicity assay and to migrate in response to inflammatory (CXCL9, CCL3 and CCL5) and constitutive (CXCL12) chemokines. RESULTS: CMV-specific T cell lines were generated from five CMV seropositive donors. In four cases CD4 and CD8 CMV-specific T cell lines were expanded successfully. Cultured T cells expressed CD8 (mean= 70%, range 60\u201381%) and CD4 (mean= 20%, range 15\u201328%) and showed a CD45RA- CCR7- Effector Memory phenothype (mean=26%, range 19\u201330%) or a CD45RA+ CCR7- T Effector Memory RA-Positive phenothype (mean=67%, range 59\u201377%). An enriched CMV-specific T cell population was observed after staining with pentamers (7\u201345% pentamer-positive T cells). Furthermore, 90% of CD8+ and 40% of CD4+ T cells expressed high levels of intracytoplasmatic perforin and granzyme. In 4/5 cases tested, cutured T cells showed a cytolitic activity against CD8-peptide pulsed target cells (average lysis=50%, range 40\u201355%) and to a lesser extent against CD4-peptide pulsed target cells (average lysis=35%, range 30\u201340%). In addition, cultured T lymphocytes were able to proliferate and to produce intracytoplasmic IFN-\u03b3 (average production=50%, range 35\u201360%) after exposure to peptide-pulsed DC. Finally, Cultured T cells strongly migrated in response to chemokines (CXCL9, CCL3 and CCL5) involved in the recruitment of effector cells during viral infection. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, a great advantage of this method is represented by the possibility to generate anti-CMV CD4+ T cells, which could support in vivo the persistence of re-infused CMV-specific CTL. Moreover, the possibility of generating peptides under GMP conditions would facilitate the translation of this approach into clinical intervention.",
