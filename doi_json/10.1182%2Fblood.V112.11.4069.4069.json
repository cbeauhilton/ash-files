    "abstract_text": "High titer (HT), \u22651:32, anti-E, anti-c and anti-D Rh antibodies can cause hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). Maternal IVIG therapy may reduce need for intrauterine and exchange transfusions in HDN. Minimal data exists regarding optimal timing of therapy initiation, dose and frequency and fetal outcomes. Late administration of IVIG therapy beyond gestational age of 16 weeks have not been shown to improve fetal outcome. We describe the clinical course of 3 pregnant women with Rh AI. Two women with high titer Rh AI were treated with early IVIG dose of 1 gm/kg/week. A third woman with low titer Rh AI did not receive IVIG. Fetal status was monitored non-invasively with weekly Fetal Doppler ultrasound measurement of peak systolic velocity (PSV) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Patient 1 was a 38 year old Caucasian female with high anti- D (> 1:500) and history of HDN; second baby required 3 exchange transfusions and third baby required 3 intrauterine transfusions during pregnancy and 2 exchange transfusions post delivery. IVIG weekly infusion was started on week 11. Amniocentesis done at week 21 showed that baby was Rh(D) positive and the Kleihauer-Bethke test was negative. Serial fetal MCA PSV done weekly till labor induction did not show evidence of significant fetal anemia. The IVIG infusions were completed on 33rd week and the patient delivered healthy baby by cesarean section on the 35th week. The baby did not receive any intra uterine or exchange transfusions. Patient 2 was a 37 year old caucasian woman with anti-c AI. The patient\u2019s husband is c antigen positive and she had seroconversion during her third pregnancy which manifested as positive antibody screen in a routine type and screen with her third delivery which was uneventful. She subsequently had a miscarriage of her fourth pregnancy at 9 weeks. Her peak anti \u2013c titer was 1: 128. She received IVIG infusion from week 11 to week 33 with stable anti-c titer of 1: 64. Serial MCA PSV assesments did not reveal significant fetal anemia. She had a normal vaginal delivery on week 34 with a healthy baby not requiring any exchange transfusions. Patient 3 was a 41 year old caucasian woman with low titer anti-E AI (1:8). No IVIG was administered as her titers remained low during her pregnancy course. Her titers were monitored every 2 weeks; peak antibody titer was 1:8. Fetal anemia was ruled out with Serial MCA PSV assesments. She delivered a healthy baby by Ceserean section at 38 weeks, 4 days.  . Patient 1 . Patient 2 . Patient3 .
