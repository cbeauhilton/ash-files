    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1680 Poster Board I-706 We previously reported (Wedgwood et al, ASH, 2007) improvement in event free survival (EFS) using Rituximab+ABVD (RABVD) in newly diagnosed patients with advanced stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) when compared to the previously published historical data from the International Prognostic Score (IPS) project using standard ABVD (Hasenclever et. Al, NEJM, 1998). The purpose of this report is to provide a final update on the EFS with long term follow up of patients who received RABVD. In addition, because of the potential difference in the EFS reported by the IPS project and a single institution results, we provide a new analysis comparing our RABVD data to that of historical data from our institution. After IRB approval, we conducted a retrospective data analysis on patients with advanced HL treated at our center with ABVD from February 1996 to May 2006. Information was collected for the IPS factors: age, stage, gender, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, albumin, and lymphocyte count. 104 consecutive patients who met the eligibility criteria for the RABVD study were identified, and were evaluable for response with at least 2 year follow up. Median age was 35 years old, 48 were female and 56 male. 23 (22%) had stage II disease, 12 of these with bulky disease, 45 (43%) stage III and 36 (35%) with stage IV. 65 (63%) had IPS 0-2 and 39 (37%) had IPS >2. The institutional 5-year EFS for ABVD patients regardless of IPS was 66%. For those with IPS 0-2 the institutional EFS was 71% compared with 74% reported by the IPS project. The institutional 5 year EFS for patients treated with ABVD with IPS >2 was 55%, compared with 55% reported by the IPS project. With a median of 5 year follow up (6-94 months) the projected EFS for RABVD is 87% which is significantly better than institutional results with ABVD (p=0.0036). Improvement in EFS was observed with RABVD in patients with IPS 0-2 (EFS 89% vs. 71%, p=0.0248); and those with IPS >2 (80% vs. 55%; p=0.0532). In conclusion, this long term follow up data confirms the superiority of RABVD to ABVD in patients with advanced stage classical HL in all risk groups. This data serves as the rationale for a multicenter randomized trial comparing ABVD with RABVD in newly diagnosed patients with classical HL with stage III and IV and IPS >2.
