Methods 31 patients with relapsed or refractory MM received two to eight 21-days cycles of PAD: comprising an intravenous bolus of bortezomib 1.3 mg/m 2 (P 1 ,N=13) or 1.0 mg/m 2 (P 2 ,N=18) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, doxorubicin 10mg per day on days 1 to 4, along with dexamethasone 40mg on days 1-4. Response to PAD was evaluated according to International Myeloma Working Group Criteria (IMWG 2006), toxicity was graded according to NCI CTCAE v3.0. Results 25 patients (80.6%) achieved at least a partial response (PR), including complete response (CR) in 9 patients (29%), very good partial response (VGPR) in 7 patients (22.6%), PR in 9 patients (29%) and stable disease (SD) in 4 patients(12.9%), progression of disease (PD) in 2 patients (6.5%); median time to progression was 9.2 months, the median courses to achieve at least PR was 1.6(1-3) cycles, all of 7 patients with extramedullary plasmacytoma achieved at least PR after the first cycle of PAD, extramedullary plasmacytoma disappeared with 1-2 cycles of PAD. The efficacy was independent of traditional prognostic factors such as\u03b22-MG, Albumin,LDH and Hemoglobin which have previously influenced response to traditional chemotherapy. 1.5 year OS (Overall survival)of CR+VGPR group and PR group were 87.5% vs 46.7% (P=0.09). \u2265PR response rate (CR +VGPR +PR) of P 1 AD and P 2 AD were 84.6% VS 77.8% (P= 0.501), CR+VGPR rate of P 1 AD and P 2 AD were 53.8% vs 50.0% (P=0.561 ). 1 year PFS(Progession-free survival) of P 1 AD and P 2 AD were 61.2% vs 55.6%(P=0.638), there were not difference between P 1 AD and P 2 AD in response rate(P= 0.501) and 1 year OS (P=0.872). Adverse events included thrombocytopenia in 15 patients ( 48.4% ), leukopenia in 8 patients(25.8%), peripheral neuropathy in 6 patients (19.4% ), varicella herpes zoster in 7 patients (22.6%), fatigue in 11 patients (35.5%) and diarrhea in 5 patients (16.1%), Thrombocytopenia and peripheral neuropathy of P 1 AD and P 2 AD were 46.2% vs 11.1%( P=0.037)and 53.8% vs 11.1%(P= 0.014).Common adverse reactions could be controlled with routine supportive treatmemt, one patient (3.2% ) died from respiratory failure during his fifth P 1 >AD. Conclusions PAD should be considered an appropriate treatment for Chinese relapsed or refractory MM, especially for MM with extramedullary plasmacytoma, its efficacy were independent of traditional prognosis factors, bortezomib dose reduction may reduce toxicities of PAD while retaining the efficacy.
