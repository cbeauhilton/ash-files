    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1272 Poster Board I-294 About ten percent of infants with Down syndrome (DS) are born with a transient myeloproliferative disorder (DS-TMD), which spontaneously resolves within the first few months of life. However, the basis for this resolution remains unknown. Acquired mutations leading to exclusive production of a short isoform of the transcription factor GATA-1 (GATA-1s) occur in all cases of DS-TMD, and knock-in mice that exclusively produce GATA-1s have hyperproliferation of megakaryocytes during early fetal liver hematopoiesis, but not during later developmental stages. In this study, we found striking upregulation of the interferon-\u03b1a (IFN-\u03b1a) receptor and multiple IFN-\u03b1a responsive genes, including Ifi203, Ifi205, Irf-1, Irf-8, and Ifitm6, in immunophenotypically isolated megakaryocyte progenitor cells (MkPs) from bone marrow versus embryonic day 13.5 (e13.5) fetal liver of wild type mice. These differences were confirmed at the protein level in megakaryocytes by in situ immunohistochemistry. Addition of IFN-\u03b1a to GATA-1s containing e13.5 fetal liver MkPs reduces their hyperproliferation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, injection of neutralizing IFN-\u03b1a/\u03b2 antibodies, but not control IgG, into adult GATA-1s mice markedly increases the percentage of bone marrow CD41+ cells and morphologically recognizable megakaryocytes, in contrast to wild type mice. We propose that increases in IFN-\u03b1a signaling during megakaryocyte ontogeny may account for the developmental stage-specific effects of GATA-1s on megakaryocyte hyperproliferation, and possibly the spontaneous resolution of DS-TMD. Interestingly, the genes encoding the IFN-\u03b1a/\u03b2 receptor are located on human chromosome 21 and are expressed at 1.6 times that in trisomy versus disomy 21 cells. We speculate that increased interferon alpha signaling during embryogenesis may be the basis for the strong selective pressure for GATA-1s producing mutations in trisomy 21 fetuses in the first place.
