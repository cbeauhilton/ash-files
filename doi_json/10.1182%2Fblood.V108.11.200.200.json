    "abstract_text": "Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is a fatal congenital disorder of the immune system associated with systemic toxicity due to accumulation of purine metabolites. We previously showed that retroviral-mediated ADA gene transfer into autologous hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC) allowed restoration of immune and metabolic functions. We have now enrolled eight ADA-SCID children (age: 7\u201367 months) in our phase I/II gene therapy trial in which HSC are combined with low intensity conditioning with busulfan (total dose 4 mg/Kg i.v.). Previous treatment included haploidentical bone marrow transplant (n=3) or long-term (>1 year) enzyme replacement therapy (PEG-ADA) (n=4) associated with insufficient immune reconstitution or severe autoimmunity. In the latter case, PEG-ADA was discontinued to favour the growth advantage for gene corrected cells. The patients received a median dose of 8.8x106/Kg bone marrow CD34+ cells (range 0.9\u201310.8), containing on average 26.2\u00b19.6% transduced CFU-C. Five patients experienced ANC 1 year after gene therapy, we observed a progressive increase in lymphocyte counts which was sustained over time (median at 1.5 years 1.6x109/L), polyclonal thymopoiesis and normalization of T-cell functions in vitro. Serum Ig levels improved and evidence of antigen-specific antibodies was obtained, leading to IVIG discontinuation in five patients. All the children are currently healthy and thriving, and none of them showed severe infections. Sustained ADA activity in lymphocytes and RBC resulted in a dramatic reduction of RBC purine toxic metabolites (dAXP<30 nmoles/ml in 5 patients) and amelioration of children\u2019s growth and development. In summary, these data confirm that gene therapy is safe and efficacious in correcting both the immune and metabolic defect in ADA-SCID, with proven clinical benefit."
