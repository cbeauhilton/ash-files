    "abstract_text": "Background and Aims The detection of sequence variants and copy number changes can improve diagnosis, inform prognosis and guide treatment in patients with bone marrow failure syndromes (BMFS). We aimed to establish and prospectively assess the impact of comprehensive genomic evaluation on diagnostic categorisation and clinical outcomes in patients with genomically uncharacterised BMFS. Methods Eligible patients were recruited from four participating institutions across Victoria, Australia. Inclusion criteria were (i) age >3 months (ii) clinicopathological diagnosis or suspicion of either acquired aplastic anaemia (AA), inherited BMFS, hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome (hMDS) or a BMFS with marrow hypoplasia/aplasia not able to be definitively categorised. Patients initially underwent 90-gene targeted sequencing (Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre PanHaem and Myeloid Amplicon next generation sequencing [NGS] panels) for rapid turnaround of accredited results for clinical decision-making. In addition, whole exome sequencing (WES), whole genome copy number analysis, NGS T-cell receptor \u03b2 (TRB) repertoire assessment and longitudinal monitoring of selected mutations by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) were performed. All patients received pre-test counselling and assessment. Genomic results were reviewed in centralised multidisciplinary case conferences including the treating clinician, molecular haematopathologists, medical scientists, clinical geneticists and genetic counsellors. Results 100 patients were enrolled. Median age was 25 years (range 3 months - 80 years); 39% were under 18 years. Detection of sequence variants or copy number abnormalities led to or confirmed a diagnosis of either an inherited or acquired BMFS in 36 patients. In 17 patients a diagnosis of an inherited BMFS was positively made by detection of pathogenic sequence variants or copy number changes in FANCA (1 patient [pt]), FANCM (1 pt), FANCI (1 pt), RAD51C (1 pt), HAX1 (1 pt), SBDS (1 pt), DNAJC21 (1 pt), RPS19 (5 pts), RPL35A (1 pt), TERT (1 pt), TINF2 (1 pt) and SAMD9L (1 pt). In five patients the clinical BMFS was considered undifferentiated without a clear candidate gene suspected on phenotypic features prior to genomic evaluation. Importantly, an established diagnosis of AA was altered to an inherited BMFS by genomic characterisation in two patients ( SAMD9L , FANCA ). In 19 patients pathogenic sequence variants or copy number changes were detected either leading to or confirming a diagnosis of an acquired BMFS (paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, hMDS or AA). Pathogenic sequence variants were detected in TET2 (n=5), RUNX1 (n=4), ASXL1 (n=3), PIGA (n=3), DNMT3A (n=3), CBL (n=2), and BCOR / IDH2 / SF3B1 / SRSF2 / TP53 / U2AF1 (n=1 each). Sequencing-detected copy number abnormalities included loss of chromosome 7 (n=6), losses on chromosome 5q (n=2) and copy number loss of ETV6 (n=2). Longitudinal monitoring of an acquired truncating RUNX1 mutation by ddPCR resulted in one patient undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplant for a progressively rising allelic burden. There was a trend towards more restricted TRB diversity in patients with genomically-defined acquired BMFS versus inherited BMFS (normalised Shannon index \u22640.85, 36.4% vs 0%, p=0.09). Conclusion We have established and evaluated a model of comprehensive multimodal genomic characterisation and multidisciplinary care for 100 patients with BMFS. Our results demonstrate a significant contribution to diagnostic categorisation and patient care in this area of clinical need. Disclosures Lieschke: CSL Behring Australia: Consultancy.
