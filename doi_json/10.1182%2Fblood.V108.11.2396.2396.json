    "abstract_text": "Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) is an incurable indolent lymphoma, and there are relatively few prognostic biomarkers for this important NHL subtype. We evaluated the hypothesis that inherited variability in cytokine and immune-related genes was associated with overall survival in SLL. We genotyped 73 SNPs in 44 candidate genes in 140 SLL patients aged 20\u201370 years who participated in a population-based case-control study conducted from 1998\u20132000 through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registries in Detroit, Seattle, Iowa, and Los Angeles. DNA was extracted from a venous blood sample or mouthwash buccal cell sample. All genotyping was conducted at the National Cancer Institute Core Genotyping Facility using the Taqman platform. Histology, stage, presence of B-symptoms, first course of therapy, date of last follow-up, and vital status were derived from linkage to registry databases at each study site in the spring of 2005. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval for the association between individual SNPs and overall survival, adjusted for age, demographic and clinical factors. Multiple simultaneous modeling strategies were used to identify the best summary multi-SNP risk score to predict survival. At last follow-up, there were 45 deaths in 140 patients (32%). The median follow-up of the 95 surviving patients was 58 months (range 24\u201375 months). In multivariate modeling, SNPs in IL13 (rs1800925; HR CC =2.36, 1.24\u20134.49), IL7R (rs1494555; HR GG =2.20, 0.84\u20135.76), and TNF-alpha (rs1800630; HR AC/AA =1.73, 0.95\u20133.17) were the strongest and most robust predictors of survival. Two or more deleterious genotypes from these three SNPs increased the risk of death (HR=2.2, 1.2\u20134.1) compared with one or fewer deleterious genotypes (p=0.009). Three groups (low, intermediate, and high risk) were defined by combining the SNP score and a clinical/demographic score. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier survival estimates for these groups were 85%, 65%, and 11%, respectively. Compared to patients with a low risk score, patients with intermediate (HR=2.5, 1.2\u20135.1) or high (HR=11, 4.3\u201327.7) risk scores had poorer overall survival ( p =3.9 x 10 \u22128 ). Our preliminary results suggest that SNPs in IL13 , IL7R, and TNF-alpha alone and in combination predict overall survival in SLL, lending support to the hypothesis that host genetic background is a promising class of prognostic biomarkers in SLL.",
