    "abstract_text": "Background: We recently described the T cell antigen coupler (TAC) technology (Helsen et. al. Nature Communications) which is a chimeric receptor that targets antigens in an MHC-independent fashion and activates T cells by co-opting the natural TCR receptor. In vitro and in vivo assessments of TAC T cells in solid tumor models have revealed that TACs mediate biological effects that are distinct from conventional chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and offer safety advantages, including greater target selectivity and reduced off-target toxicity. Here, we present in vitro and in vivo data showing that TAC-engineered T cells directed against CD19 and BCMA demonstrate robust anti-tumor efficacy in haematological malignancies with no detectable side effects. Materials and Methods: T cells from health donors were engineered with TAC receptors directed against CD19 or BCMA using lentivirus vectors. Flow cytometry was employed to measure surface expression of TAC receptors, cytokine production and proliferation of TAC T cells following stimulation with relevant target cells. Antigen-specific toxicity was measured using a luciferase-based killing assay. Anti-tumor activity was measured against acute lymphoblast leukemia for CD19 and multiple myeloma for BCMA xenografts in immunodeficient NRG mice. Results: Engineering T cells with TAC receptors targeted against either CD19 or BCMA revealed antigen-specific activation of cytokine production, cytotoxic function and proliferation. TAC T cells, but not CAR engineered T cells, show significant selectivity towards the context of antigen presentation. This is reflected by the differential proliferative response to a diverse framework of antigen surface arrangement, potentially indicating that TAC T cells are less susceptible to off target activation and the resulting toxicities. Treatment of established NALM-6 xenografts (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and KMS-11 xenografts (multiple myeloma) with CD19 TAC T cells and BCMA TAC T cells, respectively, resulted in clearance of tumors within a few weeks of T cell infusion. Mice that cleared tumors following TAC T cell treatment were resistant to subsequent challenge with fresh tumor cells demonstrating persistence of TAC T cells. Treatment with control TAC T cells that carry no binding domain had no impact on tumor growth. Monitoring of TAC T cells post-infusion revealed robust expansion that peaked in the peripheral blood 1-2 weeks post-infusion. A clinical manufacturing protocol has been developed for the CD19 TAC T cells in anticipation of human trials. Conclusion: Our pre-clinical evaluation suggests that TAC therapy has the potential to becoming a safer and more effective alternative to conventional CAR therapy. A first in human Phase I/II trial with CD19 TAC T cells is expected to start in the first half of 2019. Disclosures Helsen: Triumvira Immunologics: Employment, Patents & Royalties.
