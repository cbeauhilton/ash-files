(pHSC). Once harvested, this cell population, containing both progenitors (pHSC) and stem cells (HSC), has become the common source for autologous or/and allogeneic transplantations procedures. Indeed, the new development of cell-based therapies in hematologic settings requires the understanding of mechanism involved in HSC migration and cell cycle kinetics during mobilisation. Materials and Methods: With respect to the percentage and absolute number of CD34 + cells after Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor mobilisation (G-CSF) the patients (Pts) and healthy donors were divided in two groups: Good mobilizers (GM) and poor mobilizers (PM). We studied in their CD34+ cells: cell cycle (Ki67/IP staining), clonogenic and ex vivo expansion potential, aldehyde deshydrogenase activity (Aldefluor), expression of some adhesion molecules relevant for CD34 + cells mobilisation as: VLA-4, LFA-1 and CXCR4. Results: Twenty Two Pts (Myeloma=13 and Lymphoma=9) and 9 healthy donors underwent G-CSF mobilisation with or without chemotherapy. CD34+ cells were purified using the MACS cell isolation kit and Mini-Macs columns obtaining a purity of more than 88%. Based on the percentage of circulating CD34 + , 2 populations of subjects were identified (0.1%: GM). Total white blood cells number was higher in PM arm (48.8 G/l) than in GM arm (36.75) ( p = 0.03). The median pCD34 + cell was higher in GM (60: 31-153) than in PM (35: 11-64) ( p = 0.001). Interestingly, PM showed more G0 cells than GM with mean percentages 46\u00b110 and 31\u00b110 respectively ( p =0.004). Indeed, the percentage of the S/G 2 /M fraction of CD34+ cells was higher in GM (2\u00b10.9) than in PM (0.69\u00b10.7) ( p = 0.002). Moreover, there was a trend to observe a higher total nucleated cells fold expansion potential in PM arm 27\u00b111 versus 17\u00b113 in GM (p=0.06). It should be stressed that those results were observed also when Pts and healthy donors were studied separately. Analysis of ALDH activity revealed an unexpected population of CD34 + cells that were ALDH + despite their CD133 negativity. These CD34 + ALDH + CD133 \u2212 cells were present in both patients and healthy donors but were more pronounced in pts (38% in PM versus 9% in GM; p = 0.01). Moreover, GM among healthy donors showed more cells expressing VLA-4 (87 % versus 61 % in PM arm, p = 0.05) Conclusion These results suggest important phenotypic and functional variations in CD34 + cells between PM and GM (cell cycle, expression of CD133 by ALDH + cells) as well as some differences between the healthy donors and pts (VLA-4 expression and clonogenic capacity).
