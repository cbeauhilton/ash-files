Methods The expressions of Notch1 and FoxP3 in lymphoma and bone marrow specimens from 22 cases of ATL were studied by immunohistochemical analysis. The expressions of Notch1 and FoxP3 were analyzed by Image-ProPlus 6.0 and shown in integral optical density (IOD) (X\u00b1S). Results The neoplastic T cells of 90.91% of cases expressed FoxP3 and 72.73% of cases expressed Notch1, and 63.64% of patients had Notch1 and FoxP3 co-expression. IOD of FoxP3 and Notch1 were 13.57\u00b111.38 and 8.42\u00b13.48, respectively. The comparison of their IOD had no statistical significance ( P =0.055). Conclusion The expressions of Notch1 and FoxP3 were high in ATL, which may be associated with the clinical outcome of ATL. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
