    "abstract_text": "We have previously shown that nitrite ions can be reduced by hemoglobin to nitric oxide (NO), a ubiquitous signaling molecule and potent vasodilator. Nitrite serves as a stable tissue and vascular source for NO production; the reduction reaction is maximal at about 50% oxygen saturation values and is enhanced at low pH but little is known about other effectors of this reaction. In the current work, we studied the effect of ascorbic acid on nitrite reduction under physiological conditions using chemiluminescence to quantify NO production. In physiological buffer, this reaction has a rate constant of about 1\u00d710 \u22125 M \u22121 .s \u22121 . Thus, a significant production of NO would likely occur in plasma only at pharmacological levels of ascorbic acid (> 1 mM) although lowering pH below 7.0 markedly enhances this reaction. Loading human erythrocytes with 0.5 mM dehydroascorbic acid, which is in redox equilibrium with ascorbic acid and which can significantly raise intracellular ascorbic acid levels, increased basal levels of nitrite ions from 42\u00b19.0 nM to 98\u00b156 nM. Uptake of nitrite ions into erythrocytes by incubation in 10 \u03bcM nitrite was increased about 1.5 fold by dehydroascorbic acid and the half-time of nitrite loss was slowed to the same extent. Ascorbic acid also reduced free ferric heme in erythrocytes and plasma to ferrous heme which catalyzed the reduction of nitrite to NO with a rate constant of 2.3\u00d710 3 M \u22121 .s \u22121 under physiological conditions. However, free ferrous ions did not significantly produce NO in physiological buffer (rate constant = 1.8\u00d710 \u22122 M \u22121 .s \u22121 ). The reaction of ferrous heme with nitrite was not affected by heme binding to proteins such as hemopexin and albumin, or erythrocyte membranes. These results suggest that physiological levels of ascorbic acid (20\u201380 \u03bcM in plasma and erythrocytes) may act to catalyze NO production in the blood by promoting the reduction of nitrite ions by free ferrous heme and by increasing intra-erythrocytic levels of nitrite ions which can be reduced to NO by deoxyhemoglobin."
