    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) have multi-lineage potential and can be used in transplants as a curative treatment for various hematopoietic diseases. HSPC function and behavior is tightly regulated by various cell types and factors in the bone marrow niche. One level of regulation comes from the sympathetic nervous system that innervates the niche and releases neurotransmitters to stromal cells. However, the direct regulation of HSPCs via cell surface expression of neural receptors has not been functionally explored. Using imaging mass spectrometry, we detected strong and regionally specific gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter signal in the endosteal region of mouse bone marrow. GABBR1 is known to be expressed on human HSPCs (Steidl et al., Blood 2004), however its function in their regulation has not been investigated. Based on published mouse HSPC single cell RNA-seq data (Nestorowa et al., Blood 2016), we found that a subset of HSPCs expressed the GABA type B receptor subunit 1 ( Gabbr1 ). We confirmed by surface receptor expression that a subset of mouse bone marrow HSPCs express Gabbr1 protein . Using the same single cell RNA-seq data as above, our own gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed positive correlation of Gabbr1 expression with genes involved in immune system processes, such as response to type I interferons. We generated a CRISPR-Cas9 Gabbr1 mutant mouse model on a C57/BL6 background suitable for hematopoietic studies. Analysis of Gabbr1 mutant bone marrow cells revealed a reduction in the absolute number of Lin - Sca1 + cKit + (LSK) HSPCs, but no change in the number of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs). With further hematopoietic profiling, we discovered reduced numbers of white blood cells in peripheral blood that was primarily due to fewer B220 + cells. We show that Gabbr1 null HSPCs display reduced proliferative capacity, as well as diminished reconstitution ability when transplanted in a competitive setting. An in vitro differentiation assay revealed the impaired ability of Gabbr1 null HSPCs to produce B cell lineages. We tested our predicted association with type I interferon response by administration of poly(I:C) and found reduced HSPC proliferation in Gabbr1 null mice. Our results may translate well to humans, as a rare human SNP within the GABBR1 locus was found that correlates with altered leukocyte counts (Astle et al., Cell 2016). Our results indicate an important role for Gabbr1 in the regulation of HSPC proliferation and differentiation, highlighting Gabbr1 as an emerging factor in the modulation of HSPC function and behavior.
