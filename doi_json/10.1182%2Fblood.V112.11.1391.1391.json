    "abstract_text": "Hedgehog (Hh) pathway proteins are a highly conserved family of intracellular signaling molecules that are critical for the development of multiple organs and tissues, and play a role in cell fate determination of self-renewing tissues in the adult. Mutations that impair Hh signaling have been associated with developmental abnormalities, and recent studies indicate that Hh plays an important role in hemangioblast formation and in adult hematopoiesis, as well as in the differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and progenitor cells. We used a genetic and pharmacologic approach to define the role of the Hh pathway in adult hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. We report the unexpected finding that loss of Hh signaling through conditional deletion of Smoothened (Smo) in the adult hematopoietic compartment has no effect on adult hematopoiesis, including peripheral blood count, number or cell cycle status of stem and progenitor cells, hematopoietic colony forming potential, long-term repopulating activity in competitive repopulation assays, or stress-response to serial 5-fluorouracil treatment. In support of these observations based on genetic inactivation of the pathway, we observed that pharmacologic inhibition of Hh signaling with a potent and highly selective small molecule antagonist of Smo has no apparent effect on hematopoiesis in the mouse in vivo. In addition, we observed that Hh signaling is not required for the development of MLL-AF9 mediated leukemia. Taken together, these data indicate that Hh signaling is dispensable for normal hematopoietic development and leukemogenesis, and that pharmacologic inhibition of Hh signaling, as a therapeutic strategy in treatment of solid tumors with constitutive Hh pathway activation is not likely to be associated with unmanageable hematopoietic toxicity.",
