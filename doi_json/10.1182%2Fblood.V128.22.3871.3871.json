    "abstract_text": "The historical model of hematopoiesis, mainly derived from murine studies, is based on the existence of a single hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) capable of generating all blood cell lineages. However this model has been challenged by the proposal of four types of murine HSC, which differ by their relative contribution to the myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Here we have used data from a gene therapy trial to treat Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) to explore hematopoiesis in humans. In the trial, the therapeutic vector (lentivirus) integrates into the genome at unique positions in each hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) and is consequently transmitted to all its progeny. Thus hematopoietic ontogeny in humans can be inferred by tracking the appearance of unique integration sites in fractionated blood cell populations. This provides a unique opportunity to model the developmental complexity of the human haematological system. Considerable effort over the last 15 years has been devoted to optimizing retroviral integration sites (RIS) analysis using ligation mediated PCR (LM-PCR), combined with acoustic shearing and high-throughput Illumina sequencing. Acoustic shearing enables more precise quantification of RIS abundance through the enumeration of the various sizes of shear fragments (SonicAbundance) containing a given RIS, which correspond to individual ancestor HSPC and its blood progeny. In four WAS patients treated by gene therapy, we have sorted peripheral blood samples for 5 cell types: myeloid (granulocytes and monocytes) and lymphoid subpopulations (T, B and NK cells), and analysed their RIS profile. Each RIS corresponds to a particular stem/progenitor cell clone, with a particular pattern defined by its presence or absence in each of the 5 lineages. These data are then use to reconstruct aspects of the hematopoietic hierarchy. In order to face the challenging issue of cell sorting contamination we have been using a stringent sort precision mode and we treat residual contamination explicitly in downstream statistical models. Using these approaches, we have characterized up to tens of thousands RIS per patients with a follow up of 4 years. In order to minimize biases due to sparse sampling, we concentrate on the more abundant RIS clones that can be more easily caught and are therefore analysed more reliably. We showed that a significant fraction of RIS clones are detected in a single lineage, while other RIS clones are characterized by different levels of contribution to the myeloid and lymphoid lineages, highlighting the heterogeneity of human HSC. Clones contributing to all 5 lineages are readily recovered but this study also unravels a diversity of inferred hematopoietic programs with various potentials contributing to human blood homeostasis. Longitudinal analysis of clonal dynamics is ongoing, with preliminary results highlighting the maintenance of this heterogeneity of HSPC over time. These new findings provide unique data on human hematopoiesis based on gene corrected WAS patients. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
