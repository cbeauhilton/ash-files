    "abstract_text": "Abstract 51 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a malignancy of CD5+ mature B cells that includes two distinct subtypes marked by the differential presence of immunoglobulin gene mutations and a distinct clinical course. The pathogenesis of CLL is largely unknown: in contrast to other types of B cell malignancies, CLL is not associated with recurrent, balanced chromosomal translocations, nor genes have been found that are specifically targeted by somatic mutations, with the exception of ATM and p53 in 6\u201312% of cases. Instead, more than 80% of CLL patients carry genomic deletions of chromosomal regions 13q14, 11q22\u201323, and 17p13, or trisomy 12. Of these, the 13q14.3 deletion, encompassing the DLEU2/miR-15a/miR-16-1 cluster (Calin and Croce, Nat Rev Cancer 2006), has been recently shown to promote the development of CLL in mice (Klein et al ., Cancer Cell 2010), suggesting its pathogenetic role in the human disease. To determine the extent of somatic genetic lesions (mutations and gene copy number changes) that are present in the CLL genome, we have integrated next generation whole-exome sequencing analysis (Nimblegen/Roche FLX454) and genome-wide high-density single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis (Affymetrix SNP 6.0) in 5 cases representative of the two CLL immunogenetic subgroups and their paired normal DNAs. Candidate tumor-specific nonsynonymous mutations were verified by Sanger sequencing in the same tumor/normal pairs, and all genes validated as mutated were then screened in an independent panel of 48 CLL DNAs by PCR amplification/direct sequencing of their entire coding region. The whole-exome sequencing approach revealed a total of 36 mutations, corresponding to 36 distinct genes at an average of 7 mutations/case (range, 5\u20139 mutations/case). The majority of these events were represented by single base pair substitutions (N=34, of which 30 missense mutations and 4 nonsense mutations), while frameshift insertion/deletions were rare (N=2 deletions of 4 and 32 base pairs, respectively; 5.5%). Analysis of the mutation features showed a prevalence of transitions versus transversions (64% vs 36%) and an elevated G+C over A+T ratio (66% vs 44%), analogous to the mutation spectrum observed in the genome of epithelial tumors such as colorectal, pancreatic and brain cancer. SNP array analysis in 4 of the 5 \u201cdiscovery\u201d cases confirmed the presence of the 13q14 deletion in 2 samples and identified 25 additional regions of copy number changes, corresponding to \u223c7 lesions/case (range: 3 to 10) and mostly represented by deletions (N=16/27, \u223c60%). When screened in the extended CLL panel, several of the 36 genes identified through the whole exome sequencing approach appeared to be mutated in at least one additional patient. Overall, these data indicate that the coding genome of CLL contains on average \u223c14 somatic gene alterations per case. When classified based on functional annotation, most of these lesions appeared to converge on discrete signaling pathways, which likely represent important pathogenetic and possibly therapeutic targets in CLL.
