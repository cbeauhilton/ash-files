    "abstract_text": "Autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a potentially curative procedure for patients with relapsed lymphoma (NHL). Over 60% of the cases arise in adults over 60 years of age. We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of patients >60 years old who received high dose busulfan (Bu) and cyclophosphamide (Cy) and autologous SCT for NHL. Stem cells were mobilized with G-CSF with or without chemotherapy. Patients received a dose-adjusted regimen of Bu 0.8 mg/kg IV (n=17) or 1mg/kg po (n=9) q 6 hours x 14 doses starting on Day -7 and Cy 60 mg/kg IV q day on days -3 and -2. In overweight patients, IV Bu doses were calculated based on ideal body weight and oral Bu doses and Cy doses were calculated on an adjusted body weight. All patients were treated as inpatients and received our usual supportive care including transfusion support, pneumocystis prophylaxis, antiviral prophylaxis, growth factor support and broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for febrile neutropenia. 26 consecutive patients > 60 with relapsed NHL underwent autologous SCT at Massachusetts General Hospital between 1995 and February 2005. The median age of the population was 66 (range 60\u201378) years. 17 (65%) of the 26 patients were females. 15 patients had large cell lymphoma, 2 immunoblastic lymphoma, 3 follicular lymphoma, and 6 mixed small cleaved cell and large cell. All patients had recurrent disease; 7 patients were in a CR and 19 patients in a PR at the time of transplant. The median time from diagnosis to transplant was 32 months. All patients engrafted. The median time to absolute neutrophil count > 500/uL was 10 days (range 9\u201311) days. The median time to platelet count > 50,000/uL unsupported was 15 (range 12\u201339) days. The 100-day transplant related mortality was 0%. Patients experienced the following serious toxicities: interstitial lung disease (n=1), seizures in a patient with CNS lymphoma (n=1), venoocclusive disease which resolved (n=2), and transient atrial fibrillation (n=3). With a median follow-up of 22 months (range 4 months\u20139.5 years), the two year overall survival is 63% and two year progression-free survival is 42%. Six patients above the age of 70 years have been transplanted. 100-day transplant related mortality was 0%. With a median follow up of 25 months, all 6 patients are alive and 3 of 6 are progression free. In conclusion, 1) Bu/Cy is a well-tolerated conditioning regimen for patients with NHL above the age of 60 years, including selected patients over the age of 70; 2) Age alone should therefore not be used as an exclusion criterion for autologous SCT.",
