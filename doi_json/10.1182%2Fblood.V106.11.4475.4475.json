    "abstract_text": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy, with the survival rates up to 80\u201390%, but in high-risk patients the survival rate is still unsatisfactory. The aim of this study is to analyze the pediatric ALL data of a single pediatric university center between 1987\u20132005 retrospectively to identify risk factors effecting the event free survival (EFS). In order to determine the risk factors possibly effecting the survival, we analyzed gender, age, physical examination findings, blood cell count, FAB morphology, immunophenotyping results, translocations and extramedullary involvement. During the same period, chemotherapy regimens used and response to these protocols were also analyzed. A total of 372 cases [220 male (60%) and 151 female (41%)] were diagnosed and treated in our center between 1987\u20132005. The age distribution was as follows: 7% patients under 2 years, 68% between 2\u201310 years, 25% above 10 years of age. At diagnosis, 76% patients had a hemoglobin level 10.000/mm3, 74% platelet 2cm., white blood cell >50.000/mm3 and platelet count 2cm. and \u2265M2 bone marrow status at day 14 and CD 45 negativity. After a follow up of 72\u00b159 months (1\u2013300 months) 58% of patients are alive & well, 28% were lost to follow up and 14% patients succumbed to death. Overall survival (OS) for 60&120 months follow up were 83%, 83% and event free survival (EFS) 72%, 70% respectively. In conclusion, in ALL patients risk assessment is very important to conduct appropriate therapy. Identifying such factors and implementing risk adapted therapy will improve our treatment results decreasing the toxicity rates in pediatric ALL. Therefore treatment of all ALL patients still remains a challenge.",
