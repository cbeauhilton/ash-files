    "abstract_text": "Abstract 862 Rapid relapse after discontinuation of imatinib, the need for indefinite therapy and residual disease in most patients are the major challenges in management of CML. Combinations of imatinib with IFN simultaneously, or consecutively preceding imatinib, or with araC may improve treatment outcome. The German CML Study Group therefore designed a randomized trial to compare standard imatinib vs. imatinib + interferon alpha (IFN) vs. imatinib + low dose araC vs. imatinib after IFN failure (for low- and intermediate-risk patients, high risk patients received imatinib 800 mg instead). The current evaluation represents the prefinal results of the pilot phase of the trial. Inclusion criteria were newly diagnosed BCR/ABL positive CML in chronic phase (CP). Primary aims are: prolongation of survival (overall, OS, and progression free, PFS), determination of rates of hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular remissions, adverse events (AE) and role of allografting. By the end of 2005, 670 patients were randomized, 13 had to be excluded (no CML (n=3), pregnancy, no CP (n=1 each), imatinib 800 mg (n=8)). Analysis was according to intention to treat. 657 patients were evaluable (174 with imatinib 400 mg, 196 with imatinib+IFN, 158 with imatinib+araC and 129 with imatinib after IFN-failure). 656 patients were evaluable for hematologic, 611 for cytogenetic, and 618 for molecular responses. Patient characteristics of treatment arms were similar for age (median 53 years), sex (40% female), median values for Hb (12.6 g/dl), WBC (66.2/\u03bcl), platelets (383/\u03bcl) and for Euro risk score (low 35%, intermediate 54%, high 10%). The median dose of imatinib was 400mg/die in all arms, of araC 10 mg per treatment day and of IFN 4.2 Mio I.U./die in the imatinib after IFN arm and 1.8 Mio I.U./die in the imatinib+IFN arm. Median observation time was 57.3 months. 55 patients died, 73 patients were transplanted in 1st CP, 81 patients progressed, 59 patients were switched to second generation TKIs. After 3 years 126 patients (72%) of the imatinib 400mg arm still received the initial therapy as well as 60 patients (30%) of the imatinib+IFN arm and 53 patients (34%) of the imatinib+araC arm. 9 patients (7%) of the imatinib after IFN arm are still on IFN. 5-year OS of all patients is 91%. 5-year PFS of all patients (no death, patient still in first chronic phase) is 87%. 5-year-OS and PFS according to treatment arm are shown in the Table . At 5 years, the cumulative incidences of achieving complete cytogenetic remission or major molecular remission (MMR) as determined by competing risks (death, progression) are not different ( Table ). Type and severity of adverse events (AE) over a 5-years period did not differ from those reported previously ( Table ). Hematologic AEs grade III/IV were similar in all therapy arms except leukopenia grade III/IV, which was more frequently observed in the imatinib after IFN arm (14%). Non hematologic AEs were mainly fluid retention, neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and fatigue. Neurologic symptoms and fatigue were more often reported for the therapy arms with IFN.

Currently, survival in all treatment arms is equal to, or better than in IRIS. To verify possible differences in survival, e.g. imatinib 400 mg vs. imatinib + IFN, longer observation is planned. Although cytogenetic and molecular responses in the imatinib after IFN failure arm at 5 years are inferior to that in the other treatment arms, the question of whether the consecutive therapy with IFN first and imatinib after IFN-failure provides a survival advantage requires long term follow-up. Imatinib in combination with, or after IFN, or with low dose araC are feasible and safe treatment modalities. We expect that the study will optimize and improve therapy outcome in CML.
