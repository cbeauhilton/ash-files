    "abstract_text": "Background and objective . The combination of HyperCVAD and ponatinib resulted in a high molecular response rate and survival in adults with Ph+ ALL, suggesting improved outcome compared with combinations of chemotherapy with first- or second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (Jabbour E, et al, Lancet Haematol. 2018;5:e618-e627). The Spanish PETHEMA group conducted the phase 2 PONALFIL trial, which incorporates ponatinib to the same chemotherapy as that of the ALL Ph08 trial that used imatinib as TKI (Ribera JM et al. Cancer 2019;125:2810-17). Final results of this trial are reported. Patients and method. PONALFIL trial (NCT02776605) combined ponatinib (30 mg/d) and induction chemotherapy (vincristine, daunorubicin, prednisone) followed by consolidation (high-dose methotrexate, high-dose ARA-C, mercaptopurine, etoposide) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). Ponatinib was scheduled after alloHSCT only for patients (pts) with persistence/reappearance of MRD. Response to therapy (complete morphological [CR], molecular [complete -CMR- or major -MMR-] after induction and before alloHSCT) (assessed by centralized BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratio), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival [OS]) and toxicity were analyzed. The following genetic studies were performed: 1. Additional gene abnormalities (Copy Number Alteration [CNA] analysis by SNP array Affymetrix 750K), 2. ABL1 mutation status at diagnosis (Sanger sequencing), 3. T315I mutation at diagnosis (allele-specific PCR). A propensity score comparison with the results of the ALL Ph08 trial was performed. Results. Median age was 49 (19-59) years (y), and 13/30 pts were female. One pt showed CNS involvement at diagnosis. ECOG score was <2 in 90% of pts. Median WBC count was 6.4 x10 9 /L (0.6-359.3), Hb 90 g/L (63-145), platelets 38 x10 9 /L (11-206). Immunologic phenotype was common in 26 cases, with p190 isoform in 20 pts (67%), p210 in 9 (30%) and p230 in 1 (3%). CR was attained in 30/30 pts, CMR in 14/30 (47%), MMR in 5/30 (17%) and no molecular response in 11/30 (37%). Two pts withdrew the trial during induction (thrombosis of central retina artery and severe intestinal infection, one case each). Consolidation was given to 28 pts, 2 pts withdrew the trial (physician's decision and lack of molecular response, one case each) and 26 pts received alloHSCT (20 in CMR, 6 in MMR). No relapses before HSCT were detected. One pt died by severe GVHD and two withdrew the trial (grade IV hepatic toxicity:1, protocol deviation after molecular relapse:1). One pt relapsed in BM after HSCT. Ponatinib was given after HSCT in 4/26 pts and dasatinib in 1/26 due to MRD reappearance, and 1/26 received dasatinib in CMR because of refusal to receive CNS prophylaxis, whereas 20/26 pts did not receive any TKI therapy after HSCT. Twenty-nine pts are alive (median follow-up 2.3y, range 1.3-4). 2y DFS and OS probabilities were 97% (91%-100%) and 97% (91%-100%) (Figure 1). Among 7/16 pts without CMR after consolidation and genetic material available, 4 showed IKZF1 deletion ( IKZF1 plu s in 2), 1 showed CDKN2A/B and PAX5 deletion and 2 did not show any CNA. Among 5/19 pts with molecular relapse, 3 showed IKZF1 deletion (1 being IKZF1 plus ), and 2 pts did not show any CNA. No ABL1 mutations or T315I mutation at diagnosis were found. Propensity score with 1:1 matching identified 30 pts in each cohort (variables: age, gender, ECOG, WBC, CNS involvement, cytogenetic risk and BCR/ABL isoform). 2y DFS rates for PONALFIL and ALL Ph08 trials were 97% and 62%, (p=0.005), and 2y OS rates were 97% and 66% (p=0.001) (Figure 2). 107 adverse events (AE) were registered in 20 pts (21 severe in 11 pts), prompting to withdrawn of the trial in 3 (thrombosis of central retina artery, severe bowel infection, grade IV hepatic toxicity). The most frequent AE were hematologic (28%), gastrointestinal (14%), hepatic (11%), infections (7%), and cutaneous (5%). Cardiovascular events occurred in 2 patients ( angor pectoris and thrombosis of central artery of the retina). Conclusions . The results of the PONALFIL trial show a high antileukemic efficacy with acceptable toxicity profile and compare favorably with the same chemotherapy schedule and imatinib.
