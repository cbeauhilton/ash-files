    "abstract_text": "We studied 1110 children, adolescents and young adults with \u03b2 thalassemia major transplanted with grafts from HLA-matched relative (n=677; 61%), HLA-mismatched relative (n=78; 7%), HLA-matched unrelated (n=252; 23%) and HLA-mismatched unrelated (n=103; 9%) donors in 2000 - 2016. The median age at transplantation was 6 years (range <1 - 25). Eight-five percent received \u226520 transfusions and 88% were reported as \"inadequately\" chelated. Most patients (73%) had hepatomegaly (2 cm or greater below the right costal margin) and 50% reported serum ferritin \u22652500 ng/mL. The Pesaro risk class could be assigned for only 526 (47%) of transplantations: Class I (39%), Class II (8%) and Class III (54%). Liver biopsies are not routinely performed in China. All patients received a myeloablative transplant conditioning regimen; 34% received busulfan (Bu; IV 8.4 - 13.2 mg/kg) + cyclophosphamide (Cy; 100-120 mg/kg) + thiotepa (TT; 5 mg/kg) + fludarabine (FLU; 200 mg/m 2 ), 23%, Bu (IV 11-16 mg/kg) + Cy (100-120 mg/kg) + FLU (200 mg/m 2 ), 22%, Bu (PO or IV 16 mg/kg) + Cy (200 mg/kg), 15%, treosulfan (42 mg/m 2 ) + TT (8 mg/kg) + FLU (120 mg/m 2 ) and the remaining 5%, Bu (PO or IV 12 or 16 mg/kg) or melphalan (140 mg/m 2 ) + FLU (150 - 180 mg/m 2 ) \u00b1 TT (8-10 mg/kg). Bu dosing was based on pharmacokinetic studies. In vivo T-cell depletion (anti-thymocyte globulin), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis and graft type were confounded with transplant conditioning regimen. Ninety percent of transplants were in 2006-2016. The median follow-up was 48 months (range 3 - 193). The day-28 incidence of neutrophil recovery in patients aged \u22646 years, 7-15 years and 16-25 years were 92%, 93%, and 82%, respectively, p=0.28. The corresponding day-100 incidence of platelet recovery were 93%, 90%, and 70%, respectively, p<0.001. The 5-year incidence of graft failure was higher for patients aged 16-25 years at 23% compared to 8% and 10% for patients aged \u22646 and 7-15 years (p=0.01). Risk factors associated with overall mortality and treatment failure (graft failure or death from any cause) are shown in Table 1 . Overall survival and disease-free survival (alive with sustained engraftment) were highest in children aged \u22646 years and received grafts from an HLA-matched sibling or HLA-matched unrelated donor. The 5-year probabilities of overall survival for patients aged \u22646 years, 7-15 years and 16-25 years were 91%, 83% and 55%, respectively, p<0.001. The corresponding probabilities for disease-free survival were 87%, 79% and 55%, p<0.001 (Figure 1) . In the subset of patients for whom Pesaro risk class could be assigned, mortality and treatment failure were higher for Class II and Class III compared to Class I (Table 1) . We tested for an effect of transplant center on survival and found none. Risks for acute grade II-IV GVHD were higher after HLA-mismatched related (hazard ratio [HR] 3.04, p<0.001), HLA-matched unrelated (HR 3.35, p<0.001) and HLA-mismatched unrelated (HR 2.21, p=0.003) compared to HLA-matched sibling transplants. Similarly, chronic GVHD risks were also higher after HLA-mismatched related (HR 2.64, p=0.002), HLA-matched unrelated (HR 2.13, p=0.018) and HLA-mismatched unrelated (HR 4.25, p<0.001) compared to HLA-matched sibling transplants. Nevertheless, mortality and treatment failure risks did not differ after HLA-matched sibling and HLA-matched unrelated donor transplants. In conclusion, transplantation for \u03b2 thalassemia major should be offered early (aged 6 years or younger) from an HLA-matched sibling or an HLA-matched unrelated donor. Mismatched related donor transplants were associated with higher treatment failure and overall mortality. These data suggest cautious use of the following conditioning regimens: Bu + Cy, treosulfan + TT + FLU and Bu or melphalan \u00b1 TT \u00b1 FLU although identifying an optimal conditioning regimen(s) are best studied in the setting of carefully controlled clinical trials.
