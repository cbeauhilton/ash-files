    "abstract_text": "Induction of fetal hemoglobin ( HbF , \u03b12\u03b32) via genome editing-mediated disruption of DNA regulatory elements that repress expression of \u03b3-globin genes ( HBG1 and HBG2 ) is a promising therapeutic strategy for b-hemoglobinopathies including sickle cell disease ( SCD ) and \u03b2-thalassemia. Optimal technical approaches and safety profiles are yet to be fully defined. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to target a DNA repressor element near the distal CCAAT box of the HBG1 / HBG2 promoters. This region contains a \"TGACC\" motif recognized by BCL11A, a transcriptional repressor protein that regulates \u03b3-to-\u03b2 globin switch after birth. Rare germline variants at or near this motif are associated with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin, a benign genetic condition that alleviates the clinical manifestations of co-inherited b-hemoglobinopathies. Previously, we showed that transduction of human CD34 + cells with lentiviral vector encoding Cas9 and guideRNA ( gRNA ) targeting the HBG1 / HBG2 promoter caused induction of HbF in red blood cell ( RBC ) progeny generated in vitro ( Traxler et. al , Nature Medicine v22, 2016 ). Here we present a clinically tractable approach for disrupting the HBG1 / HBG2 BCL11A binding site in human hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ). Electroporation of Cas9:gRNA ribonucleoprotein ( RNP ) complex into healthy or SCD donor CD34 + cells resulted in up to 80% on-target insertion-deletion ( indel ) mutations and 35% HbF in erythroid progeny generated in vitro . Sixteen to 17 weeks after transplantation of gene edited CD34 + cells into immunodeficient NBSGW mice, up to 75% of donor CD34 + cells in recipient bone marrow contained on-target indels, demonstrating efficient modification of repopulating human HSCs. No differences in CD34 + cell regeneration or differentiation into erythroid, T, B, or myeloid cell lineages were observed between edited and control cells. Moreover, up to 78% of gene edited erythroid cells stained with anti-HbF antibody (\"F-cells\") compared to 15% in control erythroid cells, suggesting a \"pan-cellular\" pattern of HbF expression after editing. Strikingly, human donor-derived erythroid cells in recipient bone marrow expressed up to 40% HbF compared to 3% HbF in controls. Although the editing frequencies of HBG1 and HBG2 promoters varied between different donor CD34 + cells, an engineered variant of Cas9 containing 3 nuclear localization sequences (Wu et. al, Nature Medicine v25, 2019 ) edited repopulating HSCs more efficiently and consistently than conventional Cas9 with two nuclear localization signals. Simultaneous on-target RNP-induced DSBs at both HBG1 and HBG2 can result in the deletion of the intervening 4.9-kb region, leaving a single hybrid gene with HBG2 promoter sequences fused to the downstream HBG1 gene. We detected this deletion in approximately 30% of edited cells, with no associated decline in HbF expression determined by clonal analysis of erythroid colonies. No off-target mutations were detected by targeted sequencing of the 26 top candidate sites identified by CIRCLE-seq, an in vitro genome-scale method for detecting Cas9 activity. Analysis of gene edited human donor cells purified from mouse bone marrow showed no chromosomal rearrangements by G-banding (n=20) or fluorescence in situ hybridization with a probe located distal to the HBG1/HBG2 loci (n=225). Taken together, our studies provide novel and essential preclinical evidence supporting the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of a CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing approach to induce HbF for treating hemoglobinopathies.
