The incidence of chemotherapy-induced anemia is as high as 100% for Grade 1 to 2 and 80% for Grade 3 to 4 anemia, although it varies depending on the cancer type and treatment regimen administered. Anemia is associated with high healthcare costs as well as decreased quality of life. The objective of this study was to review the economic and quality of life (QoL) outcomes of anemia in cancer patients. METHODS: A systematic search of the English-language literature published between 1990 and 2006 was conducted. Additional publications and conference proceedings were retrieved from the article bibliographies and included in the review. Articles selected include prospective or retrospective studies specifically designed to examine burden of illness, direct medical costs, indirect costs, cost drivers, or quality of life outcomes associated with chemotherapy-induced anemia in adult cancer patients. All original costs were reported, with adjusted figures (to 2006 dollars) presented in parentheses using the medical care component of the consumer price index from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. RESULTS: Of 183 abstracts screened, 36 met selection criteria and were reviewed in detail. Fifteen and 11 studies focused on economics and QoL burden associated with anemia, respectively. The average annual cost attributable to anemia ranges from $18,418 (2006 US$ $22,775) to $69,478 ($93,454) per patient. Inpatient and outpatient services account for a significant portion of the total costs of anemia. Other key cost drivers for anemia include the cost of erythropoietic drugs, which range from approximately $210 ($239) to $1,090 ($1,288) per week, and the cost of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, which range from $232 ($323) to $512 ($712) per unit. Patients with hematologic malignancies require almost double the number of RBC units and have higher associated costs than patients with solid tumors. Indirect costs include lost work time due to fatigue for an average of 4.2 sick/vacation days per month. In addition to raising the cost of care, anemia affects patient QoL in the following key domains: energy/fatigue, role (ability to work), social function, and leisure activities. Furthermore, some patients may report daily fatigue, overall decreasing everyday QoL. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is a common hematologic adverse event experienced by cancer patients, resulting in significant health care costs, indirect costs, and decrements in patient QoL. In particular, patients with hematologic malignancies incur higher anemia-associated costs compared to patients with solid tumors. The economic burden of cancer treatment-induced anemia, as well as the impact on patient QoL, should be considered when making clinical decisions regarding the optimal treatment course for patients with cancer.",
