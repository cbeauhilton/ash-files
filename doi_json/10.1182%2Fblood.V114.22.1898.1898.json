    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1898 Poster Board I-921 Introduction: JAK2V617F mutation is detected in more than 90% of cases of polycythemia vera (PV) and in about 50% of cases of essential thrombocythemia (ET). Recently, JAK2-exon 12 and MPL mutations have been reported in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). All these three mutations have a disease causing potential. There are still 50% of ET and PMF patients negative for JAK2V617F mutation. Thus, further genetic analysis to identify novel disease-related aberrations in MPN is required. Methods: We performed whole genome analysis on granulocytic DNA of 45 MPN patients (19 PV and 26 ET) using the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Array 6.0 platform [Affymetrix 6.0]. Genotypes were analyzed using Genotyping Console 3.0.2. Data were normalized against a commercial and an own set of reference samples. All patients had JAK2V617F screening performed. Clinical and analytical data and results of cytogenetics study performed at diagnosis of MPN were colected from clinical reports. Results: From 45 MPN patients, 41 had normal cytogenetics at diagnosis; there were no data concerning cytogenetics study from the rest 4 patients. Using SNP-A 6.0 platform, we detected aberrations (gain or loss of the molecular material) in the following regions: 1q12, 9p1, 17q21, 4q, 3q26 and 8p12. Aberrations in a region 1q12 (n=14) were presented in 8 of PV (gain in 3 and loss in 5) and in 6 of ET (gain in 2 and loss in 4) patients. Aberrations in a region 9p1 (n=27) were observed in 11 of PV (gain in 6 and loss in 5) and in 16 of ET (gain in 10 and loss in 6) patients. Aberrations in a region 17q21 (n=26) were presented in 11 of PV (gain in 3 and loss in 8) and in 15 of ET (gain in 9 and loss in 6) patients. Aberrations in the region 4q (n=20) were detected in 8 of PV (gain in 5 and loss in 3) and in 12 of ET (gain in 9 and loss in 3) patients. Interestingly, only the gain of the molecular material was detected in a region 3q26 (n=12; 5 PV and 7 ET patients). In case of aberration in a region 8p12 (n=20), all 12 ET patients presented gain of the molecular material, whereas PV patients had gain (n=3) or loss (n=3) of the molecular material. There were no relation between the presence of these aberrations and the status of the JAK2V617F mutation, analytical data or clinical outcome of the patients. Conclusions: 1. As we know, patients with ET have low frequency of cytogenetics aberrations. Nevertheless, using SNP-A 6.0 platform [Affymetrix 6.0], it is possible to detect new genomic aberrations in these group of patients. 2. According to our results, gain in 8p12 region is especially related to ET patients. Recently has been reported that, in a 8p12 region there is localized gen INDOL1 that, may be involved in the inhibition of immune response to tumours. 3. Gain in a 3q26 region can be related with both PV and ET. In this region, there are localized two microRNA: hsa-mir-1263 and has-mir-720. 4. SNP-A 6.0 technology should not replace conventional cytogenetics in study of MPN patients. However, SNP-A 6.0 platform, as a high resolution assay, can be useful in identification of new genomic abnormalities that may be relevant for pathogenesis of MPN.
