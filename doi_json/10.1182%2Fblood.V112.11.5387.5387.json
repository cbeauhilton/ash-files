    "abstract_text": "Backgroud . The aims of this study were to measure the serum levels of prohepcidin in anemic and non anemic infants and to evaluate the correlation between prohepcidin and iron parameters and inflammatory cytokines. Procedure. One hundred and sixty nine patients aged from 6 months to 24 months were enrolled and divided into 4 groups according to hemoglobin and serum ferritin (SF). Routine hematologic labs, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), serum prohepcidin, C reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were assessed. The subgroup of anemia of inflammation (AI) was defined as Hb 50 \u03bcg/L, the subgroup of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) as Hb <11 g/dL and SF <12 \u03bcg/L, the normal group as Hb \u226511 g/dL and SF \u226512 \u03bcg/L, and the unclassified anemia group (UCA) as <11 g/dL and SF 12\u201350 \u03bcg/L. Results. The prohepcidin levels ranged from 38.86 to 874.25 ng/mL throughout all the infants (258.60\u00b1130.03 ng/mL) but were significantly lower in the AI group than in the normal group (201.93\u00b171.74 vs 299.97\u00b1120.68 ng/mL, P =0.007). However there was no significant difference between anemic subgroups. Prohepcidin levels were positively correlated with CRP (r=0.400, P =0.048) in the AI group and were negatively correlated with sTfR in the UCA group (r=\u22120.376, P =0.022). However in both groups there were no independent predictors in multiple regression analysis. Conclusions. This study examines the prohepcidin levels in infants with anemia and without anemia. The prohepcidin levels of anemic infants were significantly lower than those of infants without anemia. However there was no correlation between prohepcidin and inflammatory cytokines or iron parameters in the groups of AI and IDA, thus we cannot differentiate between them using prohepcidin levels."
