    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4845 To screen molecular markers for refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB) in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) by serum proteome profiling. Methods Serum protein were isolated respectively from patients with RAEB, acute myeloid leukemia or normal person by 2-dimensional electrophoresis(2-DE). The imaging films were obtained and the differential reacting protein spots were recognized. Then the differential reacting proteins were obtained in the replica gel by matching analysis,and identified by peptide mass fingerprint based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and database searching. Results Seven differentially expressed proteins in RAEB were found by 2-DE. Of the 7 proteins, 4 were identified with significantly statistical difference, including dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP/CD26), polymerase (DNA directed) kappa, PRO2044 and albumin-like. Conclusion 2-DE-based serum proteome profile can help to identify serum proteomic biomarkers related to MDS. DDP/CD26 has increased serum levels in RAEB subtype MDS, suggesting significant action in advanced MDS. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
