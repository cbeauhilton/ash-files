    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The coagulopathy associated with cirrhosis is complex and places patients at risk for both bleeding and thrombosis. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been shown to have superior efficacy and safety compared to vitamin K antagonists; however their efficacy and safety in cirrhotic patients is not clear. The aim of this study is to retrospectively compare the effectiveness and bleeding complications of DOACs as compared to traditional anticoagulants in cirrhotic patients. Methods: This study was a retrospective review of patients treated at a single academic center between 2012-2015 who were prescribed a DOAC (apixaban or rivaroxaban), or a traditional anticoagulant (warfarin or low molecular weight heparin), with an ICD-9 code for the diagnosis of cirrhosis. The primary outcomes of interest are recurrent thrombosis or stroke (efficacy failure), or bleeding events (safety failure). Major bleeds were characterized as fatal bleeding, symptomatic bleeding in critical organ area, or bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level >2 or leading to transfusion of 2+ units of packed red blood cells. Results: During the study period, 27 cirrhotic patients were prescribed a DOAC and 18 were prescribed a traditional anticoagulant (either LMWH or warfarin). Both groups had similar total bleeding events (8 DOAC vs. 10 traditional anticoagulation, p = 0.12). There were significantly less major bleeding episodes in the DOAC group, (1 (4%) vs. 5 (28%), p = 0.03) and less intracranial bleeding (3 (17% ) vs. 0 (0%) p=0.06). Recurrent thrombosis or stroke occurred in 1 (4%) patient in the DOAC group and 1 (6%) patient in the traditional group ( p = 1.0). Conclusions: Anticoagulation with DOACs in cirrhotic patients may be as safe as traditional anticoagulants with respect to bleeding events. Patients with cirrhosis at our center prescribed DOACs had less major bleeding events, while maintaining efficacy at preventing stroke or recurrent thrombosis.
