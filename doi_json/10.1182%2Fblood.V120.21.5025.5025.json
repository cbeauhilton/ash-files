    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5025 The CRBN gene that encodes the cereblon protein is found on the short arm at position p26. 3 of human chromosome 3. Cereblon is a primary target of thalidomide teratogenicity and required for the anti-myeloma activity of lenalidomide and pomalidomide. CRBN depletion myeloma cells become highly resistant to both lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Baicalein, a component of Scutellaria radix from HLJDT, not only suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis of myeloma cells by down-regulating interleukin \u22126(IL-6) and XIAP gene expression, but also inhibited the signaling cascades mediated by IL-6 and facilitated myeloma cell inhibition induced by dexamethasone. In clinic, we found that treatment of thlidomide- or lenalidomide-resistant myeloma patients by applying Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang (HLJDT) can induce hematological remission. The precise molecular mechanism of HLJDT exerts its anti-tumor effects remains unclear. Here, by RT-PCR, we demonstrated that treatment of U266 cells and primary myeloma cells with 20\u03bcM baicalein can induce CRBN mRNA expression in time-dependent manner. As lenalidomide and thlidomide are effective drugs for maintenance therapy with the advantage of oral administration. It was particularly active in patients with higher cereblon expression. Thus, the combination of HLJDT with thlidomide or lenalidomide may be a novel strategy of maintenance therapy for myeloma patients. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
