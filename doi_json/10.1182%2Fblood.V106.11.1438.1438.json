    "abstract_text": "We have recently shown that high levels of interleukin-7 (IL-7) predict poor virological response in HIV-1-infected patients. To understand the underlying mechanisms associated with increase in IL-7 levels, we assess the expression of IL-7 receptor and activation markers on different CD8 subsets in there well defined groups of patients including successfully treated (ST; n=8), untreated (UT; n=6), failing HAART due to drug resistance (FT; n=12) and healthy subjects (n=5). The expression of IL-7/IL-2 receptors (CD127/CD25) and activation markers (CD38/HLA-DR) on CD8 nai\u0308ve cells (CD45RA + CCR7 + CD27 + ), central memory (T CM ; CD45RA \u2212 CCR7 + CD27 + ), pre-terminal effector memory (T PEM ; CD45RA \u2212 CCR7 \u2212 CD27 \u2212 ) and terminal effector memory cells (T TEM ; CD45RA + CCR7 \u2212 CD27 \u2212 ) was measured in fresh blood samples using 8-color flow cytometry. Mann Whitney U test and Spearman correlation were used. Although there was a trend toward a decrease in nai\u0308ve, T CM , T PEM and T TEM cells from ST to UT and then to FT, this did not reach significance (P=0.09). FT and UT subjects showed higher number of CD8 activated cells than ST or controls (22%, 20%, 3% and 4% respectively; P=0.07). Similarly, the percentages of T CM activated cells were significantly higher in FT and UT than ST or controls (28%, 27%, 7% and 0.07%; P=0.02), whereas nai\u0308ve and T TEM activated cells were similar in all groups. Interestingly, the percentage of T CM cells expressing CD127 + CD25 + was lower in FT compared to UT or ST (0.7%, 2.1 and 7.4%; P=0.02). A strong positive correlation was observed between viral load and CD8 + or T CM activated cells (r=0.46, P=0.02; r=0.65, P=0.004 respectively) but not with nai\u0308ve CD8 + cells. These data suggest that a substantial proportion of T CM but not nai\u0308ve, T PEM and T TEM cells expressing immune activation markers with lower IL-7 receptor expression is present in subjects with persistent antigen stimulation, thus providing an explanation for increasing circulating IL-7 levels.",
