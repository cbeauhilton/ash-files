    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4011 Poster Board III-947 Bidirectional signaling is an essential feature of integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 function. Outside-in signal transduction mediated by \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is required for normal hemostasis, clot retraction, platelet aggregation and spreading. In our previous work (Blood. 2005; 105: 4345-52), we showed that \u03b1IIb-mediated outside-in signaling is enhanced in human platelets (designated VTG\u03b23 \u0394 724) lacking the terminal 39 residues of the \u03b23 cytoplasmic tail. This enhanced signaling was detected as thromboxane A2 (TxA2) production and granule secretion, and required ligand cross-linking of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and platelet aggregation. This \u03b1IIb\u03b23-mediated outside-in signaling was specifically inhibited by a palmitoylated, but not a scrambled or non-palmitoylated version of a peptide corresponding to \u03b23 cytoplasmic domain (CD) residues R724-R734. Inhibition presumably occurred because the corresponding region within the \u03b23 CD (RKEFAKFEEER) can bind to the CD of \u03b1IIb and negatively regulate \u03b1IIb-mediated outside-in signaling. In this study, we elucidate part of the signaling pathway(s) underlying these \u03b1IIb-elicited events. The data presented here demonstrate that D3+Fg-induced TxA2 production and granule secretion by VTG\u03b23 \u0394 724 platelets are Src family kinase(s) (SFK), PI3K, PKC and intracellular Ca 2+ flux, but not ERK dependent. Further biochemical analysis demonstrated that D3+Fg treatment of control platelets \u00b1 10U/ml apyrase and 75mM indomethacin, induced phosphorylation of ERK and slight phosphorylation of p38, but not Akt. ERK activation was not dependent on a SFK(S) or PI3K since 10mM SFK of the inhibitor PP2 and 100nM PI3K inhibitor wortmannin did not block phosphorylation of ERK. However, Akt, and p38 were intensely phosphorylated in VTG\u03b23 \u0394 724 platelets treated with D3+Fg \u00b1 apyrase and indomethacin, meaning that activation of Akt, and p38 appears to be directly coupled to \u03b1IIb-mediated signaling, and not coupled to TxA2 and ADP-driven signaling. Phosphorylation of p38 and Akt, but not ERK, was totally blocked by 10mM PP2. Wortmannin (100nM) inhibited phosphorylation of Akt, but not P38 and ERK. Therefore, SFK-PI3K/Akt-PKC play an important role in \u03b1IIb-mediated signaling. Akt phosphorylation in VTG\u03b23 \u0394 724 platelets stimulated by D3+Fg was also specifically inhibited by a palmitoylated \u03b23R724-R734 peptide but not by a palmitoylated scrambled control peptide, which further proves that SFK-PI3K signaling pathway is mediated specifically by \u03b1IIb. The role of \u03b1IIb-mediated SFK-dependent PI3K/Akt signaling was investigated in normal washed platelets by stimulating those platelets with a level of the PAR4 peptide that caused secretion-dependent aggregation. The aggregation initiated \u03b1IIb\u03b23-mediated outside-in signaling in both mouse and human washed platelets. The PAR4 peptide-induced Akt phosphorylation, TxA2 production and granule secretion were \u03b1IIb\u03b23, aggregation, and PI3K-dependent, in the absence of ADP and TxA2 initiated signaling. The palmitoylated peptide \u03b23R724-R734 (10mM), but not a control peptide blocked ATP secretion, TxA2 production and Akt phosphorylation in normal platelets stimulated with the PAR4 peptide. Therefore, the \u03b1IIb-initiated SFK(s), PI3K/Akt, PKC signaling pathway is responsible for TxA2 production and granule secretion, in both VTG\u03b23 \u0394 724 and normal platelets. SFK-dependent p38 activation is also triggered by \u03b1IIb-mediated signaling, but it is not Akt-dependent and the function of p38 in \u03b1IIb-mediated signaling events is unknown. Finally, ERK activation is \u03b1IIb\u03b23-dependent, but not \u03b1IIb\u03b23-mediated; therefore ERK activation probably is an effect of non-\u03b1IIb-mediated contact-dependent signaling. The work presented here provides a new understanding of \u03b1IIbb3- outside-in signaling. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
