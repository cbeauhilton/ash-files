    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5270 Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is a key glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible phosphotransfer reaction from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) to ADP to form 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) and ATP. It is a small monomeric molecule characterized by two hinge-bent domains, with a highly conserved structure. The N-terminal domain binds 1,3-BPG or 3-PG, whereas the C-terminal domain binds Mg-ADP or Mg-ATP. Two isozymes, PGK1 and PGK2, are present in humans, encoded by two distinct genes. Whereas PGK2 is a testis-specific enzyme, PGK1 is expressed in all the somatic cells. The PGK1 gene is located on the Xq-13.1 chromosome, and encodes a protein of 416 amino acids. Mutations of the PGK1 gene result in enzyme deficiency characterized at clinical level by mild to severe hemolytic anemia, neurological dysfunctions and myopathy. Patients rarely exhibit all three clinical features. Since the first description by Kraus et al, nearly 40 patients with PGK deficiency have been reported, 27 of them characterized at the DNA or protein level. To date, 20 different mutations with worldwide distribution have been described. The aim of the study was to characterize the molecular defect in an Italian patient affected by phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency. The patient, born from unrelated parents with negative family history of neurological defects, showed at birth neonatal jaundice. At the age of four years, in concomitance of an infective episode, he displayed hemolytic anemia (Hb 8.6 g/dL, reticulocytes 19%, unconjugated bilirubin 0.91 mg/dL, LDH 445 u/l, aptoglobin absent) and increased CPK values (2483U/L). The patient showed respiratory distress. The study of red cell glycolytic enzymes displayed a drastic reduction of PGK activity (41.8 UI/gHb ref. values 287\u2013392). We examined again the patient at the age of 25 yrs in occasion of his sister's first pregnancy. The patient displayed compensated hemolytic anemia (Hb 14.1 g/dL, reticulocytes 6.6%) and severe myopathy. Sequencing analysis of the entire coding region and flanking intronic sequences of PGK1 gene showed the presence of a novel missense mutation c.1112 (ATA>AAA) responsible for amino acid substitution Ile371Lys. Although the mutation falls in the third last nucleotide of exon 9, it doesn't alter the splicing as confirmed by patient cDNA analysis that showed a normal transcript. The new mutation is located in a highly conserved region among species close to the ATP binding site and it was not found among the 100 normal alleles examined thus excluding the possibility of a polymorphism. Family study performed in the parents, the two healthy sisters and maternal uncle confirmed the X-linked transmission of the disease. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
