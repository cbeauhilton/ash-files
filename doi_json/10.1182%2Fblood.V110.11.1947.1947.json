    "abstract_text": "Background: 2 nd generation TKI have shown preclinical activity against imatinib resistant BCR-ABL mutations with the exception of T315I. Relative sensitivities of different mutations to various TKI differ. The clinical response of BCR-ABL with particular mutations has been modeled by classifying each mutation based on the in vitro IC 50 for each drug against kinase activity for BCR-ABL with that mutation into high, intermediate, and low sensitivity groups. Study Aims: We investigated how patients (pts) with tumors with particular intermediate sensitivity BCR-ABL KD mutations against one TKI responded before and after shift to an alternative TKI that would be predicted to have more potency. Methods: Mutation sensitivity was defined by the IC 50 for each specific drug( O\u2019Hare, Can Res  2005 ; 65 : 4500 ; Bradeen, Blood  2006 ; 108 : 2332 ). Mutations with intermediate sensitivity to dasatinib (D) and nilotinib (N) were defined as those with an IC 50 of 2\u201320 nM and 200\u2013450 nM. Results: We identified 30 pts who developed intermediate sensitivity mutations to N or D, with median age of 54 years (36\u201396) followed for 24 months (mo) (6\u201338) from the start of therapy with 2 nd generation TKI. 24 pts had such mutations at the start of 2 nd line therapy, with N (n=15: 4 CP,6 AP,5 BP), or D (n=9: 6 CP,3 AP). 7/15 (47%) responded to N (best responses: 1 CMR, 1 MMR, 1 CCyR,1 MiCyR, 3 CHR) for a median of 18 mo (3\u201333). 3 have ongoing responses: 2 with F317L have CMR and PCyR at 17 and 29 mo, and 1 (F359C) a CCyR at 33 mo. 8/11 (89%) responded to D (3 CCyR, 4 CHR, 1 PHR) for a median of 16 mo (4\u201329); 2 (both Y253H) have an ongoing CCyR at 24 and 29 mo (Table 1).14 received 3 rd line TKI [2 N (2 CP), 9 D (2 CP, 4 AP, 3 BP), 3 bosutinib (3 CP), 1 INNO-406 (1 CP)], and 3 pts 4 th line TKI [1 N (1 CP), 2 INNO-406 (1 AP, 1 CP)]. 7/9 pts responded to D as 3 rd line for a median of 11 mo (3\u201322) with 1 ongoing CCyR at 22 mo (F359V). 1/2 pts with F317L who failed D responded to N (ongoing CCyR at 3 mo) (Table 2). Three pts in CP (2 F317L, 1 V299L) received bosutinib as 3 rd line: 2 (both F317L) had a transient CHR (6 and 9 mo). INNO-406 was used as 3 rd line in 1 in CP (Y253H) and 4 th line in 2 [CP (F317L), AP (V299L)] with no response. Conclusion: Clinical efficacy of 2 nd generation TKI correlates with in vitro sensitivity of KD-mutations. In pts failing a TKI in whom a mutation with intermediate in vitro sensitivity to this agent is detected, change to an agent with better in vitro potency against such mutation may improve the response.
