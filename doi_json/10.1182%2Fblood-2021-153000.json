    "abstract_text": "Background: The simple point mutation that causes sickle cell disease (SCD) belies the extensive systemic damage it can cause. While the sickle pathology is initiated by polymerization of HbS, the multiple end-organ damage is inflicted by years of on-going inflammation and vasculopathy. An emerging marker of inflammation is the accumulation of acquired heteroplasmy mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Given the underlying chronic inflammation in SCD, we hypothesized that SCD patients display increased rates of mtDNA mutations, and previously confirmed (1). Here, we further performed indepth analyses in an ethnically matched normal (HbAA) as well as sickle trait (HbAS) subjects from another independent cohort, the Jackson Heart Study (JHS). Methods: We analyzed and compared whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from the from NIH cohort of 676 SCD patients of African ancestry with that of 621 ethnic-matched indviduals from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KG), and 3,580 individuals from the JHS cohort. The NIH SCD cohort included 561 HbSS & HbS\u03b2 0 thalassemia (combined), 90 HbSC, and 25 HbS\u03b2 + thalassemia genotypes, the 1KG cohort - 516 HbAA and 105 HbAS and JHS cohort - 3,200 HbAA, 89 HbAC (hemoglobin C trait), and 291 HbAS. Additionally, to further understand any potential sequencing depth bias, as well as to compare between two patient cohorts (NIH SCD & JHS cohorts) with underlying conditons that may influence the heteroplasmy bias, we downsampled 300 NIH cohort HbSS samples to a sequencing depth similar to JHS cohort, and compared their heteroplasmy burden. Mitochondrial sequences extracted from the cleaned WGS data of these 3 cohorts were analyzed for heteroplasmic and homoplasmic variants using mitoCaller from the package mitoAnalyzer . Results: The average depth per locus was ~6,671X for the NIH SCD cohort , ~2,879X for the 1KG cohort, and ~2169X for JHS cohort. We compared the quantity of heteroplasmic variants across the different NIH SCD genotype with 1KG (HbAA & HbAS), and JHS (HbAA, HbAC and HbAS) genotypic groups. The median number of heteroplasmic variants per individual increased progressively from HbAA, HbAS, HbS\u03b2 + thalassemia, and HbSC with the highest median number of 118 in HbSS & HbS\u03b2 0 (Fig 1A) in NIH SCD cohort. It is noteworthy that the median mtDNA heteroplasmy in HbAA individuals in 1KG cohort was significantly lower than those in JHS cohort (Table insert in Fig 1A) which may be related to the underlying cardiovascular disease in the JHS cohort; whereas similar heteroplasmy burden in HbAS individuals between these 2 cohorts may underscore the genotype (HbAS) as the driver of heteroplasmy in these cohorts. We compared the heteroplasmy burden of a downsampled subset (n=300) NIH HbSS with that of JHS HbAA, HbAC and HbAS genotypes (Fig 1B). Although, the 70% reduction in sequencing depth resulted in the slight reduction in heteroplasmy burden, we noticed higher heteroplasmic variability (standard deviation) in this subset of NIH HbSS patients. This variability may be attributable to extreme variation in SCD phenotypic severity. We then applied cumulative distribution function to this downsampled subset and compared with JHS genotypes. We found the NIH HbSS patients have disproportionately higher proportion of heteroplasmy variants (Fig 1D) when compared to the JHS genotypes (HbAA, HbAC, and HbAS). Conclusion : We conclude that there is an increased prevalence of heteroplasmic mtDNA variants in SCD compared to ethnic-matched normal (HbAA) populations. Normal individuals with HbAA in JHS cohort have significantly higher heteroplasmic burden compared to those in 1KG cohort, suggesting an underlying cardiovascular disease in JHS cohort as a driving factor. Within each 1KG and JHS cohorts, individuals with sickle cell trait (HbAS) have similar heteroplasmy burden and also higher than those with HbAA, highlighting the potential significance of this genotype. Reducing the sequencing depth by > 70% (downsampling) led to the filtering out of heteroplasmy variants that would have been discovered with the original deeper sequencing depth of ~7300X. Nonetheless, downsampled HbSS samples still retained disproportionately higher heteroplasmy burden compared to non-SCD subjects. We are currently investigating if there is any correlation between mtDNA heteroplasmy burden and severity of clinical phenotypes among the SCD patients. 1.
