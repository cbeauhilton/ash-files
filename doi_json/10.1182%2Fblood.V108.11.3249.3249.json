    "abstract_text": "Gene transfer into hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC) by gammaretroviral vectors is an effective treatment for patients affected by severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to adenosine deaminase (ADA)-deficiency. Recent studied have indicated that gammaretroviral vectors integrate in a non-random fashion in their host genome, but there is still limited information on the distribution of retroviral insertion sites (RIS) in human long-term reconstituting HSC following therapeutic gene transfer. We performed a genome-wide analysis of RIS in transduced bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells before transplantation (in vitro) and in hematopoietic cell subsets (ex vivo) from five ADA-SCID patients treated with gene therapy combined to low-dose busulfan. Vector-genome junctions were cloned by inverse or linker-mediated PCR, sequenced, mapped onto the human genome, and compared to a library of randomly cloned human genome fragments or to the expected distribution for the NCBI annotation. Both in vitro (n=212) and ex vivo (n=496) RIS showed a non-random distribution, with strong preference for a 5-kb window around transcription start sites (23.6% and 28.8%, respectively) and for gene-dense regions. Integrations occurring inside the transcribed portion of a RefSeq genes were more represented in vitro than ex vivo (50.9 vs 41.3%), while RIS =6 months) revealed a high number of distinct RIS (range 42\u2013121) in the T-cell compartment, in agreement with the complexity of the T-cell repertoire, while fewer RIS were retrieved from granulocytes. The presence of shared integrants among multiple lineages confirmed that the gene transfer protocol was adequate to allow stable engraftment of multipotent HSC. Taken together, our data show that transplantation of ADA-transduced HSC does not result in skewing or expansion of malignant clones in vivo, despite the occurrence of insertions near potentially oncogenic genomic sites. These results, combined to the relatively long-term follow-up of patients, indicate that retroviral-mediated gene transfer for ADA-SCID has a favorable safety profile.",
