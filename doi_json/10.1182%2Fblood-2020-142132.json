    "abstract_text": "Background: Emicizumab, a humanized bispecific antibody, has been approved for the prophylactic treatment of hemophilia A in patients with and without inhibitors. Both activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) based FVIII:C and inhibitor assays, as well as select chromogenic FVIII:C assays have been reported to be affected in the presence of emicizumab. Aims: To assess the effect of emicizumab spiked at 0, 25, 50, and 100 ug/mL into congenital FVIII deficient plasma, containing FVIII inhibitor at 0, 1 and 5 BU, in seven commonly used APTT and chromogenic based FVIII:C assays. Samples were also tested in an APTT and chromogenic based FVIII Nijmegen inhibitor assay. Methods: Four IVD approved, APTT based FVIII:C assays and three chromogenic FVIII:C assays were evaluated (Table 1). In addition, FVIII inhibitor levels were measured by Nijmegen Bethesda assay using either APTT (Actin\u00aeFSL, Siemens Healthcare) or chromogenic based (FVIII Chromogenic Assay, Siemens Healthcare) FVIII:C assays. Results: Reagent and dose-dependent increases in FVIII:C were observed for all APTT reagents tested as well as for the BIOPHEN FVIII:C chromogenic assay. The presence of low or high titer inhibitors did not impact APTT based FVIII:C measured. Neither of the two chromogenic FVIII:C assays, using bovine based FX and FIXa (i.e. FVIII Chromogenic Assay and Coatest\u00aeSP4) demonstrated measurable FVIII levels at any of the emicizumab concentrations tested. FVIII Nijmegen Bethesda inhibitor results using APTT based FVIII:C, when tested in the presence of emicizumab, consistently produced false negative results (Table 1) whereas results determined using the FVIII Chromogenic Assay measured inhibitor titers at expected concentrations. Conclusion: Confirming previously published results, emicizumab interferes in the APTT based FVIII:C and Nijmegen Bethesda inhibitor assays. Even at low emicizumab concentrations, false negative inhibitor titers are measured in APTT based inhibitor assays. Using a bovine based chromogenic FVIII:C assay is imperative when measuring both FVIII:C and FVIII inhibitors in samples containing emicizumab.
