    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1462 Poster Board I-485 Klf1/Eklf regulates a diverse suite of genes to direct erythroid cell differentiation from bi-potent progenitors. To determine the local cis-regulatory contexts and transcription factor networks in which Klf1 works, we performed Klf1 ChIP-seq using the SOLiD deep sequencing platform. We mapped more than 10 million unique 35mer tags and found \u223c1500 sites in the genome of primary fetal liver erythroid cells are occupied by endogenous Klf1. Many reside within well characterised erythroid gene promoters (e.g. b-globin) or enhancers (e.g. E2f2 intron 1), but some are >100kb from any known gene. We tested a number of Klf1 bound promoter and intragenic sites for activity in erythroid cell lines and zebrafish. Our data suggests Klf1 directly regulates most aspects of terminal erythroid differentiation including synthesis of the hemoglobin tetramer, construction of a deformable red cell membrane and cytoskeleton, bimodal regulation of proliferation, and co-ordination of anti-apoptosis and enucleation pathways. Additionally, we suggest new mechanisms for Klf1 co-operation with other transcription factors such as those of the gata, ets and myb families based on over-representation and spatial constraints of their binding motifs in the vicinity of Klf1-bound promoters and enhancers. Finally, we have identified a group of \u223c100 Klf1-occupied sites in fetal liver which overlap with Klf4-occupied sites in ES cells defined by Klf4 ChIP-seq. These sites are associated with genes controlling the cell cycle and proliferation and are Klf4-dependent in skin, gut and ES cells, suggesting a global paradigm for Klfs as regulators of differentiation in many, if not all, cell types.
