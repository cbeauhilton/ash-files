Although the accumulated progresses in treatment regimen have raised the 5-year survival rate as high as 80% for whole pediatric patients, only poor prognosis, an overall survival rate of 30%, can be still now expected for the patients with relapsed diseases. Widespread extramedullary involvement such as liver, spleen, lymph nodes and central nervous system invasion is a well-known characteristic of ALL related to poor prognosis. Recently, bone marrow (BM) microenvironments supporting leukemic cells have been widely noticed as an important element which influences on treatment response and relapse of disease. Although the mechanism of extramedullary dissemination has been the most crucial issues in the study of leukemia, it still remains incompletely understood. In this study, we established a novel murine model of human ALL with NOD/SCID/\u03b3c null (NOG) mouse. Using this model, we examined the involvement of SDF-1-CXCR4 signaling axis in hepatomegary development in ALL. Result Primary bone marrow samples were collected from 13 children with ALL at the time of diagnosis with informed consent. The leukemic cells (1\u00d710 6 cells) were injected into the tail veins of non-irradiated 8- to 10-week old NOD/SCID/\u03b3c null (NOG) mice, a transgenic mouse with severe combined immunodeficiency and IL-2 receptor chain allelic mutation showing high potential to reconstitute the normal human hematopoietic system. Primary samples from 10 out of 13 patients were successfully engrafted into mice without any conditioning such as prior irradiation and DNA-damaging agents medication, and those engrafted leukemic cells were able to be serially transplanted into secondary, tertiary and quaternary recipients. Morphological and FACS analyses revealed as high as >80% blood chimerism and conserved blast phenotypes through serial transplantations. Moreover, extramedullary organs including liver, spleen and kidneys showed the leukemic invasion consistent with donor ALL disease. In contrast, no normal human hematopoiesis was observed in our xenotransplantation system without conditioning. CXCR4 is a known regulator of lymphocyte migration and has been suggested to be important for proliferation of normal leucocytes and leukemic cells. CXCR4 expression and function of leukemic cells in NOG mice were confirmed by flow cytometry and in vitro chemotaxis assays towards its known chemokine ligand SDF-1. Immunohistorical analysis of liver reveals that SDF-1 was detectable only in biliary duct endotherial cells. Finally, we demonstrated directly the effect of SDF-1-CXCR4 axis in our model by using the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 in vivo and in vitro. Discussion: NOG mice model for engraftment of human leukemic cells provides significant insights into the biology of ALL and allows us to answer various questions concerning the molecular mechanism of extramedullaly invasion. This non-conditioning approach may prevent possible damage to the host microenvironment, thereby providing a more natural model for growth of human leukemic cells in mice. Our present study on the involvement of SDF-1-CXCR4 axis in ALL dissemination could rink to the novel therapies in future which target the extramedullary sites in order to perfectly overcome ALL.
