    "abstract_text": "Background : Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is primarily diagnosed histologically using tissue biopsy. Free light chain (FLC) assay and serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) have both been studied as tools to screen and monitor PTLD. However, limited data are available to compare these two assays in a well characterized patient population. It is also not clear what reference ranges should be adopted for the FLC assay in a post-transplant population. Method : Blood samples from 169 patients receiving a variety of solid organ transplants were analyzed for FLCs and screened for gammopathies by SPE/IFE. Results : Compared with non-PTLD patients, PTLD patients had higher mean, median and upper 95 percentile range of both \u03ba and \u03bb FLCs (p ranging from 0.0002 to 0.024). The mean, median and 95 percentile range of \u03ba:\u03bb ratio were similar between the two groups. PTLD patients were more likely to have polyclonal or monoclonal FLC elevations (p = 0.04). They also showed a higher frequency of gammopathy abnormalities (p = 0.0052). Nonetheless, neither FLC assay nor SPE demonstrated a clear association with the timing of PTLD diagnosis. FLC concentrations in non-PTLD recipients were higher than those in the general healthy population (95 percentile range: \u03ba, 0.60-8.33 mg/dL vs. 0.33-1.94 mg/dL; \u03bb, 0.77-7.08 mg/dL vs. 0.571-2.63 mg/dL) but the \u03ba:\u03bb ratio was similar to that of the healthy group (0.26-1.65). Conclusions : Our results suggested that elevated FLC concentrations and gammopathy abnormalities were both associated with PTLD. Therefore, FLC assay and SPE should be used conjunctively for screening PTLD among solid organ transplant recipients. For this application, the data showed that a higher upper limit of \u03ba and \u03bb FLC levels and normal \u03ba:\u03bb ratio should be used as diagnostic reference ranges. Additionally, neither method was clearly associated with the timing of PTLD diagnosis, indicating that they may be unsuitable for monitoring PTLD in the post-transplant population. Table 1.
