    "abstract_text": "Introduction: EBV seropositivity in general population is 80%. Reactivation of latent infection in pre-transplant seropositive patients causes post-transplant lenfoproliferative disease (PTLD) following Allo-HSCT. The effect of donor EBV positivity on recipient's risk of graft versus host disease is not clear. Our aim is to present EBV seroprevalence and PTLD incidence as well as demonstrating the relation of EBV seropositivity with GVHD. Patients and Methods: A total of 364 allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients and donors were evaluated retrospectively from 2006 to 2015. During Allo-HSCT preparation procedures all recipients and donors were serologically tested. EBV specific IgG (VCA-IgG, EBNAIgG, EA-IgG) and IgM (VCA-IgM) antibodies were determined by Chemiluminescence by ARCHITECT lab analyzers using commercially available kits (Abbott, USA). All patients were followed for reactivation. Results: EBV IgG positivity was detected in 338 of recipients (92.8%) and 283 of donors (77.7%). There was no statistically difference detected between related or unrelated transplants. The mean age was 37 (range 16-67). 217 recipients were male (60%). 295 (81%) patients were transplanted for malign hematological diseases. The majority of patients were grafted from full-matched related donors (258, 71%). The most common source of stem cell was peripheral blood in 299 patients (82%) followed by bone-marrow in 56 patients (15%), bone-marrow plus peripheral blood in 9 patients (3%). 273 (75%) patients received myeloablative conditioning regimen. All patients received prophylactic acyclovir (in related transplants 400mg 3 times daily, in un-related transplants 800mg 3 times daily) starting from conditioning and up to three months posttranplant period. One pretransplant seropositive 26 year-old aplastic anemia patient had PTLD with EBV IgM positivity within 3 months posttransplant. He received 4 cycles of rituximab and prednisolone and achieved complete response. Three patients had EBV IgM positivity in posttransplant 4, 9 and 24 th months with symptoms of infectious mononucleosis. The seropositivity resolved without treatment. Acute GVHD developed in 223 patients (61%) whereas chronic GVHD was detected in 285 (78%) of patients. The incidence of acute GVHD was similar when donor was EBV seropositive compared to seronegative (78% vs 22%, p=0.72). Chronic GVHD incidence was similar between donor EBV seropositive group compared to seronegative group (80% vs 20%, P=0.199). Conclusion: EBV seropositivity is common detected in 92.8% of our allo-HSCT recipient cohort. Donor EBV status did not have an effect on developing acute or chronic GVHD.
