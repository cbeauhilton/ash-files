    "abstract_text": "Introduction : The nuclear export protein Exportin 1 (XPO1) is overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers including multiple myeloma. Selinexor is a novel, first-in-class selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE), which blocks XPO1, forcing the nuclear retention and activation of tumor suppressor proteins. Selinexor in combination with low dose dexamethasone (Sel-dex) was recently approved based on data from the STORM study, wherein Sel-dex induced an overall response rate (ORR) of 26.2% in patients with penta-exposed, triple-class refractory multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone has been approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma with an ORR of 60-76%. The STOMP study assessed the efficacy and safety of the all oral combination of selinexor, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (SRd) in patients with relapsed/refractory and newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. We previously reported the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of once weekly selinexor 60 mg, lenalidomide 25 mg and dexamethasone achieved an ORR of 92% in patients with RRMM who were lenalidomide naive. Here we evaluated once weekly selinexor in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Methods: STOMP is a multicenter, open-label study with a dose escalation (phase 1) and expansion (phase 2) to assess the maximum tolerated dose, RP2D, efficacy and safety of SRd in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were eligible if they had symptomatic myeloma per the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) guidelines with either hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, bone lesions (CRAB) criteria or myeloma defining events needing systemic therapy. Enrollment in this arm is ongoing. Results: As of July 01 2019, 8 patients (4 males and 4 females ) with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were enrolled at the starting dose level of selinexor 60 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; lenalidomide 25 mg daily 1-21and dexamethasone 40 mg weekly on a 28 day cycle. The median age was 74 years (range: 51-86 years). No dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were observed in 5 DLT evaluable patients, 3 patients were not DLT evaluable because 1 patient did not finish cycle 1 due to social reasons and 2 patients missed doses due to serious adverse events (SAEs) unrelated to study drugs.. Common treatment related hematologic AEs (Grades 1/2, \u22653) were neutropenia (0%, 75%), anemia (0%, 25%), and thrombocytopenia (0%, 25%). Common non-hematologic AEs were diarrhea (63%, 0%), nausea (50%, 0%), fatigue (0%, 38%) decreased weight (38%, 0%), constipation (25%, 0%), hypokalemia (25%, 0%), and hypomagnesemia (25%, 0%). Among 7 efficacy evaluable patients, 6 patients achieved a response (ORR of 86%) including 1 complete response, 1 very good partial responses, 4 partial responses (2 unconfirmed), and 1 patient achieved a minimal response. With a median follow-up of 6.1 months, median progression-free survival was not reached. Conclusions: The all oral combination of SRd has promising activity with 6 of 7 efficacy evaluable patients achieving an objective response in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and no new or unexpected safety signals.
