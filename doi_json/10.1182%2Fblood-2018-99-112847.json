    "abstract_text": "Background: A histologic finding of large cell transformation (LCT) in Mycosis fungoides (MF) is often associated with an aggressive clinical course and inferior prognosis (Arulogun et al. Blood 2008). In patients (pts) with advanced MF (stage IIB-IV), LCT has been established as an independent prognostic factor (Scarisbrick et al. JCO 2015). Although CD30 expression is observed more frequently in MF with LCT vs without LCT, a wide range of CD30 expression levels is observed in LCT lesions and the level of expression lacks prognostic value for MF (Vergier et al. Blood. 2000). The ALCANZA study (NCT01578499) demonstrated significantly better rates of objective response lasting \u22654 months (ORR4) (\u220643.8%; p<0.0001) and progression-free survival (PFS) (16.7 months vs 3.5 months; p<0.0001) with brentuximab vedotin vs physician's choice (PC) of oral methotrexate or bexarotene in adults with previously treated CD30+ MF or primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (Prince et al. Lancet 2017). Despite variability in CD30 expression, significant improvements in ORR4 and PFS were consistently seen with brentuximab vedotin over PC, across all CD30 expression levels in pts with MF. This post-hoc analysis characterized the proportion of pts with LCT, efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in pts with LCT and relationship to CD30 expression. Methods: Analyses were performed on skin biopsies taken from 98 pts with previously treated CD30+ MF who were randomized 1:1 to receive brentuximab vedotin or PC. CD30 expression levels were measured by immunohistochemistry on samples obtained during screening of pts for the ALCANZA study. LCT status at baseline was assessed using \u22652 biopsies obtained at screening; pts were deemed to have LCT if any biopsy showed presence of LCT (large cells - with nuclei \u22654 times larger than those of normal lymphocytes - present in >25% of total dermal infiltrate or forming microscopic nodules). Objective response rates lasting \u22654 months (ORR4), PFS, and safety endpoints were assessed according to LCT and CD30 expression. Results: Baseline demographics and LCT status by disease stage are described in Table 1. In both arms, 17/49 pts (35%) pts had LCT, and LCT was found more frequently in stage IIB pts (59% [brentuximab vedotin] and 41% [PC]). Brentuximab vedotin improved ORR4 vs PC in pts with LCT (11/17 [64.7%] vs 3/17 [17.6%]; p=0.006) and without LCT (12/31 [38.7%] vs 2/31 [6.5%]; p=0.003) (Table 2). Median PFS improved with brentuximab vedotin vs PC in pts with LCT (15.5 vs 2.8 months; HR=0.304; 95% CI 0.139, 0.668; p=0.002) and without LCT (16.1 vs 3.5 months; HR=0.364; 95% CI 0.200, 0.662; p<0.001). Median PFS follow-up times were 26.0 months (both arms, pts without LCT), 36.0 months (brentuximab vedotin arm, pts with LCT), and not estimable (PC arm, pts with LCT). Grade \u22653 adverse event (AE), drug-related grade \u22653 AE and serious AE rates were similar across LCT status groups (Table 2), and CD30 expression levels and were not associated with treatment-emergent AEs in the brentuximab vedotin arm. In pts with LCT, median average CD30 expression was 50% of total dermal infiltrate (range 3-95%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 35% (6.3-97.5%) in the PC arm (Figure 1), although pts with high baseline average CD30 expression (upper tercile of all enrolled MF pts) were more likely to have LCT; in the high CD30 expression sub-group, 56% and 64% of pts had LCT in the brentuximab vedotin and PC arms, respectively. Globally, pts with LCT treated with brentuximab vedotin who achieved an ORR4 had higher median average baseline CD30 levels (65%) vs pts who did not attain ORR4 (20%). Of the pts with LCT who achieved an ORR4, 9/11 pts in the brentuximab vedotin arm had baseline average CD30 expression levels \u226540%, but responses were also noted in the 2 pts with low average CD30 levels (10% and 17.5%). Conclusions: Previously, there were limited data on the relationship between LCT status and clinical outcome or CD30 expression in MF pts treated with brentuximab vedotin. Our analyses demonstrated that pts with MF benefitted from brentuximab vedotin regardless of LCT status. A wide range of CD30 expression levels was observed in pts with MF and LCT. In these pts, high baseline CD30 expression levels were generally predictive of a good response to treatment with brentuximab vedotin although meaningful responses were observed in those with lower CD30 levels.
