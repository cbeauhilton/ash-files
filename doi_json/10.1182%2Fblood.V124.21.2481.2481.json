    "abstract_text": "Introduction: To date, worldwide, the main source of stem cells is peripheral blood (PBSCs). However, its use has been associated with a higher incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) when compared with the use of bone marrow. It has been demonstrated that the fast engraftment using G-CSF-primed bone marrow as a source of stem cells, compares to that seen with PBSCs, and it is also associated with a decreased incidence of GVHD. Objective: To describe the results obtained from allogeneic, G-CSF-primed bone marrow transplantations, at INCMNSZ, from November 1998 to March 2013. Material and methods: A retrospective analysis was performed in patients who underwent allogeneic, G-CSF-primed bone marrow transplantation. Clinical characteristics, frequency of GVHD, and survival, were conducted, using the Statistical Software Package SPSS v21.0. Results: Forty-nine patients who underwent allogeneic, G-CSF-primed bone marrow transplantation, from November 1998 to March 2013, were included. Patients (male, 63%) had a median age of 29 years (range 16-59). The patients had a following range of underlying diseases: aplastic anemia (n=15, 30.6%), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=12, 24.5%), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, n=9, 18.4%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (LLA, n=7, 14.3%), acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n=3, 6.1%), or others (n=3, 6.1%). Patients achieved a bilineage engraftment with a median time of 20 days (range, 11-40) for absolute neutrophil count and 15 days (range, 5-45) for platelets. Acute GVHD was observed in 4 patients (8.2%), reported as grade I and II; and 14 patients (28.6%) experienced a limited form of chronic GVHD. Nine out of 49 (18.3%) patients relapsed: CML (n=5), AML (n=1), AA (n=1), ALL (n=1), others (n=1). All patients with relapsed CML were treated with donor lymphocyte infusions, but only 2 responded. Treatment related mortality (TRM) was 8.16%, including infectious complications in 2 patients, cGVHD in one patient, and veno-oclussive disease (VOD) in one patient. Overall mortality was 26.5%; the majority of deaths (69.2%) were caused by progressive and relapsing disease. With a follow up of 43 months (0-149), the median overall survival (OS) has not been reached; however, the estimated 10-year OS is 69%. Conclusion: According to our data, it seems that G-CSF-primed bone marrow is a better source of hematopoietic stem cells for allogeneic transplantation in malignant and non-malignant hematological disorders, when compared with PBSCs, due to the similar engraftment time, and a decreased incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD. Nevertheless, this strategy does not appear to be valid as an approach for diseases were graft versus tumor effect (GVT) is important to eradicate the malignancy, such as in CML.
