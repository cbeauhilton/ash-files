    "abstract_text": "The Durie-Salmon (DS) stage has been the gold standard for stratification of MM patients. However, the system does not contain beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) widely recognized as the single most powerful prognostic parameter. Recently, The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) staging system ( Jacobson JL, et al. Br J Haematol  122 : 441 \u201350, 2003 ) and the International Staging System (ISS) ( Greipp PR, et al. J Clin Oncol  23 : 3412 \u201320, 2005 ) utilizing B2M have been proposed. We aimed to evaluate whether the stage assessed at the time of ASCT by DS, SWOG, or ISS predict outcome following ASCT in patients with MM. Between November 1996 and December 2004, a total of 141 patients with MM who were treated with ASCT at 5 institutions in Korea were available for this analysis. The distribution of patients\u2019 stage at ASCT by 3 staging systems was as Table 1. With a median follow-up of 20 months from ASCT, the median event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 16 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 11\u201321) and 56 months (95% CI, 38\u201374), respectively. The median survival of each stage group according to 3 staging systems at ASCT was as Table 2. Differences in EFS among the stage groups were not statistically significant. However, OS after ASCT was dependent on the SWOG stage at the time of ASCT and also significantly longer in patients with ISS stage I than others (NR vs. 39 months, P =.001). In this study, OS following ASCT was influenced by the stage according to SWOG or ISS, but not DS. The distribution of patients by 3 staging systems  Stage . I . II . III . IV .
