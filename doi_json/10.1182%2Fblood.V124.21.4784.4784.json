    "abstract_text": "Background Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a highly lethal disease with only 20% of 5 years survival. Most AML patients experience relapse usually leading to death. Progression to therapy resistant AML is driven by leukemia stem cells (LSC) harboring enhanced survival, dormancy and self-renewal capacity in supportive niches. Growing evidence indicates that in the development of myeloid malignancies deregulation of stem cells activity is as important as deregulation of the BM microenvironment. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway molecules in general and SMO in particular are well known to maintain the growth of cancer cells. However, it\u2019s role in leukemia niche-stem cell interaction is not well defined. Therefore, here we investigate: 1/ how the small molecule, SMO antagonist, PF-0449913 impacts the AML BM microenvironment and 2/ how in turn, changes in the activity of AML BM niche cells contribute to its remodeling into HSC supportive niche. Methods CD34- cell from bone marrow patients undergoing hip replacement surgery (normal BM) as well as AML bone marrow were utilized for the development of the primary human stromal monolayers. We investigated stromal cultures of primary normal BM (NBM, n=6) and AML (n=6). As a control human normal bone marrow stromal cell line HS-5 was used. Then human CD34 + cells were selected from AML primary samples (n=6). As a normal control, CD34 + cells from cord blood (CB, n=5), or NBM (n=5) were utilized for the co-culture experiments for up to 9 weeks and then plated in survival and self-renewal assays. PF-0449913 was added to stromal co-cultures or, as a pre-treatment, directly to stromal monolayers. Results In order to examine the role of SMO regulation in LSC generation and maintenance, primary AML (n=6) or cord blood (n=3) CD34+ cells were co-cultures with normal BM (n=3) or AML (n=3) stroma in the presence of novel small molecule inhibitor (PF-0449913) for 2 weeks. It significantly reduced LSC survival and self-renewal, while spared HSC. These effects were not observed in the absence of stroma. Importantly, pre-treatment of the AML stroma with PF-0449913 for 1 week prior- to co-culture also resulted in LSC\u2019s inhibition of survival and self-renewal. AML- and normal BM-derived stroma differ in their ability to support HSC and LSC: LSC (n=6) were capable to self-renew after 9 weeks of co-culture with both normal and AML stroma, while cord blood (n=4) as well as normal BM (n=5) HSC lost their self-renewal potential after only 2 weeks of co-culture with the AML stroma. PF-0449913 induced changes in AML stroma. which was previously unsupportive to HSC survival, it became compliant : self-renewal of HSC increased more than 3 times. It reversed also the inhibitory effect of AML stroma-derived conditioned media (CM). Pre-treatment of the HS-5 cells with CM from AML stroma for 4 weeks prior to co-culture experiments led to significant inhibition of the cord blood (n=3) and NBM (n=3) HSC survival and self-renewal. However, in CM obtained from AML stroma treated with PF-0449913 that effect was reversed. Combined treatment of AML cells (n=6) with PF-0449913 and de-methylating agent Vidaza (5-azacytodine) or CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 resulted in even greater inhibition of LSC survival and self-renewal. However, Vidaza did not mediate changes in AML stroma. Conclusions Together these data indicate that, while both conditioned media and co-culture with AML stroma impaired HSC survival and self-renewal, co-culture conditions resulted in a greater reduction in survival and self-renewal capacity, implicating that cell-cell contact or unstable secreted factors exacerbate the effects. That suggests that microenvironmental cues play a key role in regulating normal HSC versus LSC survival and maintenance, and leukemic stroma exibit severely compromised ability to maintain normal HSCs, but effectively support LSCs. PF-0449913treatment of AML induces not only eradication of LSC, but also mediate changes in AML stroma, supporting HSC generation and maintenance. Simultaneous targeting of both AML niche and LSC could represent a novel avenue for treatment of AML patients. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
