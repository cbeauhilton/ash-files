    "abstract_text": "Background: Patients (pts) with R/R aggressive large B cell NHL who fail first-line therapy with immunochemotherapy and are ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have a poor prognosis. Available treatment options include platinum/gemcitabine-based or bendamustine-based regimens in combination with rituximab, with or without radiotherapy, or clinical trials. However, long-term outcomes remain poor due to lack of a curative option. Liso-cel is an investigational, anti-CD19, defined composition, 4-1BB CAR T cell product administered at target doses of CD4+ and CD8+ CAR T cells. In the ongoing TRANSCEND NHL 001 study of liso-cel as third- or later-line treatment for pts with R/R large B cell NHL, preliminary data showed high overall response rates with a low incidence of grade \u22653 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurological events (NEs) (Abramson et al, ASCO 2018). The open-label, phase 2 PILOT study is assessing the safety and efficacy of liso-cel as second-line therapy in TNE pts (NCT03483103). PILOT is the first study evaluating CAR T cell therapy focusing on this pt population. Methods: Eligible pts had R/R large B cell NHL (diffuse large B cell lymphoma [DLBCL], not otherwise specified [NOS], de novo or transformed indolent NHL, high-grade lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 [double/triple-hit lymphoma], or follicular lymphoma (FL) grade 3B) and had received only 1 prior line of immunochemotherapy containing an anthracycline and a CD20-targeted agent (eg, R-CHOP). Pts had to be deemed ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy followed by HSCT by meeting at least 1 of the following TNE criteria while still fulfilling the criteria for CAR T cell therapy: age \u226570 years, ECOG PS of 2, and/or impaired pulmonary (DLCO \u226460% but SaO 2 \u226592% on room air and CTCAE \u22641 dyspnea), cardiac (LVEF \u226540% and 30 and 2 and \u22645 \u00d7ULN). Liso-cel was administered at a target dose of 100\u00d710 6 CAR+ T cells after lymphodepletion (LD) with fludarabine/cyclophosphamide for 3 days. Pts could be treated as outpatients at the investigator's discretion. Results: At data cutoff, 10 pts had been leukapheresed, and 9 pts had LD followed by liso-cel infusion; 1 pt is awaiting liso-cel treatment. Liso-cel was manufactured successfully in all pts. Five pts were infused and monitored as outpatients. Median age was 71 (range, 64-79) years; 5 pts were male. Histology included DLBCL NOS (n=7) and transformed FL (n=2); 2 pts had triple-hit, one of whom had transformed from FL. Five pts had relapsed from, and 4 pts had disease refractory to, prior therapy. Median SPD and LDH were 26.6 cm 2 and 201 U/L, respectively. Four pts had high tumor burden with SPD \u226550 cm 2 (n=4) and/or LDH \u2265500 U/L (n=1). The median Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) score was 3 (range, 0-3). Six pts had 1 or more treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) grade \u22653, which were primarily cytopenias. Three pts had prolonged grade \u22653 cytopenias at Day 29. Two pts had infections of any grade; no pts had grade \u22653 infections. No pts had CRS or NEs, and no pts received tocilizumab, corticosteroids, or vasopressors. There were no cases of macrophage activation syndrome, tumor lysis syndrome, infusion reactions, or grade 5 TEAEs. Among the 5 pts treated and monitored as outpatients, none were admitted to hospital for adverse events within the first 29 days post liso-cel infusion. All 9 pts achieved an objective response. Four pts achieved complete response; all are ongoing. Five pts achieved partial response (PR), with 2 PRs ongoing. Results were similar in inpatient vs outpatient pts. Median follow-up was 3.5 months. Median (range) time to peak CAR T cell expansion was 10 (7-21) days. Conclusions: These preliminary safety and efficacy data from the ongoing phase 2 PILOT study suggest that liso-cel can be successfully administered, including in the outpatient setting, as second-line therapy in pts with R/R aggressive B cell NHL who were ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and HSCT by prespecified criteria. Updated safety and efficacy data with longer follow-up will be presented. Disclosures Sehgal: Kite/Gilead: Research Funding; Merck: Research Funding; Juno/Celgene: Research Funding.
