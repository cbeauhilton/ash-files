    "abstract_text": "Background: Targeting BCMA (B-cell maturation factor) with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells has shown great success in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), but is limited by heterogeneous antigen expression and imminent antigen escape of tumor cells. Combinatorial antigen targeting may help address these challenges. Taking the naturally occurring receptor-ligand pairs as a model, we designed monomeric and trimeric APRIL- (A proliferation-inducing ligand) based CARs targeting BCMA and TACI (transmembrane activator and CAML interactor) simultaneously. Methods: The following 2 nd generation CARs were designed to target BCMA and TACI concurrently: membrane-tethered truncated APRIL monomer (\"APRIL-CAR\") and three truncated and fused APRIL monomers (\"TriPRIL-CAR\"). A single chain variable fragment-based anti(\u03b1)-BCMA CAR served as control. CAR multimerization and binding affinity to BCMA and TACI were characterized. In vitro effector function was compared by cytotoxic potency, activation (CD69), degranulation (CD107a), cytokine production and proliferation in response to target antigens. In vivo anti-tumor efficiency was assessed in a xenograft mouse model of MM. Results: CAR T cell manufacturing of all three constructs was accomplished successfully (transduction efficiency 46-78%) from three different donors. Western blot analysis of CARs showed multimerized forms of the TriPRIL and \u03b1-BCMA CAR, while only the monomeric form of the APRIL CAR was detected. Binding affinity to soluble BCMA and TACI was higher for the TriPRIL CAR compared to the APRIL CAR. Evaluating the cytotoxic potential, activation and degranulation kinetics as well as long-term proliferation against a panel of BCMA and/or TACI positive target cells, the TriPRIL CAR T cells outperformed the APRIL CAR T cells. All three CAR constructs demonstrated robust antigen-specific production of Th1-type cytokines, like Il-2, IFN\u0194, GM-CSF and TNF\u03b1. Next, we performed an in vivo stress test, engrafting NSG mice with high tumor burden of MM.1s myeloma cells. The TriPRIL and \u03b1-BCMA CAR T cells were able to eradicate the tumors while the APRIL CAR T cells only led to a stabilization of tumor burden. In vivo studies with a mixed antigen population aiming at modeling heterogeneous antigen expression and antigen escape are ongoing. Conclusion: Our APRIL-based chimeric antigen receptors were able to redirect T cell cytotoxicity to both BCMA and TACI positive tumor cells. Since both these receptors are consistently up-regulated on malignant plasma cells this is an attractive method to target MM. Furthermore, we found that using a trimeric form of APRIL rather than monomeric form as the CAR binding domain increased recognition of MM antigens in vitro and in vivo .
