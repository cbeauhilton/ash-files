    "abstract_text": "Abstract 40 Transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a severe side-effect of blood transfusion characterized by the acute onset of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Meanwhile, TRALI turned out to be the leading cause of transfusion related fatalities. Accumulated evidence demonstrates that antibodies against human neutrophil antigens (HNAs) play a major role in the pathomechanism of TRALI. Recent studies show that antibodies against the allelic isoform of choline transporter like protein 2 (CTL-2 Arg154 isoform; also known as HNA-3a) are associated with high TRALI mortality. The mechanism underlying this fatal reaction, however, is not clear. In this study, we aimed to identify the mechanism of fatal TRALI induced by HNA-3 antibody under in vitro as well as in vivo conditions. Analysis of mRNA by real-time PCR in different blood cells and endothelial cells (EC) revealed abundant copies of CTL-2 transcripts in ECs in comparison to neutrophils and platelets. This result was confirmed by immunochemical analysis using rabbit antibody specific for CTL-2 as well human antibodies against HNA-3a. In contrast to treatment of neutrophils, treatment of EC with HNA-3a antibodies, but not with antibodies against the antithetical allelic CTL-2 isoform (Gln154 isoform; HNA-3b), leads to significant production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). When HNA-3aa EC monolayers were treated with human anti-HNA-3a antibodies, a significant increase in albumin-FITC influx in transwell system was observed when compared to controls. In line with this observation, a strong reduction of transendothelial electrical resistance was measured. Microscopically, drastic stress fiber formation and gap formation was visible. Immunoblotting analysis of HNA-3a treated ECs showed a significant degradation of VE-cadherin. This observation indicates that anti-HNA-3a antibodies induce EC barrier disturbance via ROS-mediated destabilization of VE-cadherin in cell junctions. Accordingly, this antibody-mediated barrier leakage can be ameliorated by the vasoactive peptide adrenomedulin (ADM), which prevents cell destruction in response to oxidative stress. In an in vivo murine model of TRALI , with lipopolysaccharide primed C57BL/6 mice upon injection of HNA-3a antibodies a significant increase in lung weight and elevated concentration of albumin and number of neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage was observed, indicating the formation of lung edema in these mice. Neutrophil depletion mitigated this effect in mice, but failed to prevent TRALI. Our data demonstrate the direct influence of transfused HNA-3a antibodies on endothelial barrier integrity in vitro as well as in vivo . This novel mechanism of TRALI may be helpful in defining prevention and treatment strategies in order to decrease transfusion mortality. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
