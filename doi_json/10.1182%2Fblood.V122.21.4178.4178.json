    "abstract_text": "Background Although hypogammaglobulinemia is a well-recognized complication in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), its prevalence at the time of CLL diagnosis and association with novel prognostic markers and clinical outcomes are not well understood. Methods All patients seen at Mayo Clinic between 1/1995 - 4/2013 with newly diagnosed CLL (<12 months diagnosis) and who had baseline assessment of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) were included in this analysis. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics as well as serum IgG levels measured by either immunoassay or serum protein electrophoresis analysis were recorded. Based on the normal range for IgG at our laboratory, patients with serum IgG<757 mg/dL were classified as having hypogammaglobulinemia. Patients with IgG<757 were also further stratified by terciles (lower tercile: IgG<585 mg/dL; middle tercile: IgG 585-687 mg/dL, upper tercile: IgG 688-756 mg/dL). The relationship between hypogammaglobulinemia at diagnosis and prognostic parameters including immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IGHV ) gene mutation status, genetic abnormalities detected by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), and ZAP-70, CD38 and CD49d expression was assessed. Associations of hypogammaglobulinemia with time to first treatment (TTT) and overall survival (OS) was also evaluated. Results Of 1485 patients who met the eligibility criteria, 382 (26%) had hypogammaglobulinemia (median IgG=624 mg/dL) at the time of CLL diagnosis while the remaining 1103 (74%) had normal serum IgG levels (median IgG=1040 mg/dL).

After median follow-up of 4.2 years, 479 (32%) patients had received treatment for CLL, and 328 (22%) patients had died. The median TTT for patients with hypogammaglobulinemia was 3.8 years compared to 7.4 years for patients with a normal IgG (p-value<0.001). Among patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, the median TTT for patients in the lower, middle, and upper terciles were 1.7, 2.9, and 6.3 years respectively (p-value<0.001, Figure 1 ). On multivariable analysis that included age, gender, Rai stage, IGHV mutation status, FISH risk category and hypogammaglobulinemia, the following were independently associated with a shorter TTT: advanced (III-IV) Rai stage (hazard ratio [HR] =15.3, p<0.0001); intermediate (I-II) Rai stage (HR=3.0, p<0.0001); unmutated IGHV (HR=2.6, p=<0.0001); and hypogammaglobulinemia (HR=1.5, p=0.02). View large Download slide View large Download slide Conclusion In this large cohort study, approximately one-quarter of CLL patients had a low serum IgG level at the time of diagnosis. High-risk features, including advanced Rai stage and expression of CD49d, were associated with greater risk of hypogammaglobulinemia at the time of diagnosis. Patients with hypogammaglobulinemia at diagnosis had shorter TTT, a finding that persisted after adjusting for other prognostic factors. Evaluation of acquired hypogammaglobulinemia during the course of follow-up among patients who initially had normal IgG levels is ongoing.
