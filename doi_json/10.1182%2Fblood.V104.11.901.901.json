    "abstract_text": "To evaluate BMT outcomes in patients (pts) with newly diagnosed or relapsed mantle cell lymphoma, 58 consecutive pts were selected through the BMT registry at Johns Hopkins. Flow cytometric and immunohistochemical features were confirmed. Fifty-four pts (88%) had stage III or IV disease and 39 (67%) had documented bone marrow involvement at diagnosis. First-line therapy was CHOP +/\u2212 rituximab in 71% and was fludarabine-based in 17%. Thirty-seven pts (64%) were transplanted after first partial or complete remission, 14 pts (24%) after one or more relapses, and 12% after primary induction failure (PIF). Median age at BMT was 55 years. Thirty-eight pts (66%) received autologous (auto) BMT, 19 pts (33%) allogeneic (allo) BMT, and 1 pt syngeneic BMT. Preparative regimens in all but 1 case consisted of cyclophosphamide plus busulfan or total body irradiation. The estimated 3-year event-free survival (EFS) following BMT was 51% (95% CI, 35\u201365%), probability of relapse 31% (17\u201351%), and overall survival 59% (42\u201373%). Median follow-up is 16 months (range < 1 month to 79 months) for all pts and 23 months for surviving pts. Twelve relapses were documented, 8 after auto BMT. Four auto pts and 1 allo pt are alive with relapsed disease, and 3 auto pts developed MDS or AML. Actuarial EFS at 3 years was 57% (CI 35\u201374%) after auto BMT and 37% (17\u201357%) after allo BMT. Actuarial relapse rate at 3 years was 34% following auto BMT and 19% following allo BMT. On multiple regression analysis, BMT after one or more relapses (HR 3.0, CI 1.2\u20137.4, P = 0.02), PIF (HR 5.4, CI 1.9\u201315.4, P = 0.002), and allo BMT (HR 3.0, CI 1.3\u20136.8, P = 0.007) predicted an inferior EFS; View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure whereas PIF and residual bone marrow involvement independently predicted relapse. Notably, however, EFS curves were not statistically different for auto and allo BMT performed in first remission, with the 3 year EFS approaching or equaling 70%.

While the comparative efficacy of auto and allo BMT remains to be determined, allo BMT warrants continued study especially early in the disease course.",
