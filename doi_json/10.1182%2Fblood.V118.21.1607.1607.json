    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1607 Methotrexate is an antifolate agent commonly used for the treatment of lymphoma. The most common adverse effects include mucositis, myelosuppression, hepatic dysfunction and renal toxicities. It inhibits DNA replication by blocking the conversion of 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate to 5-methylene tetrahydrofolate by methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). MTHFR is a key enzyme in folate metabolism and C677T is one of principal polymorphisms implicated in the metabolism of methotrexate. We aimed to investigate the relationship of the C677T polymorphism with methotrexate concentration in serum as well as methotrexate-associated toxicities. The study cohort included 169 cases treated with regimens containing high dose methotrexate (higher than 1 g/m 2 ) between January 2010 and May 2011. Median age of the patients was 56 years (range, 24\u201378 years). Concentration of methotrexate was measured daily beginning 48 hours after infusion until the concentration reaches below 0.05 \u03bcmol/L. Forty four cases (26.0%) had a wild genotype of CC, 78 (46.2%) a heterozygous genotype of CT, and 47 (27.8%) a homozygous mutant genotype of TT. Mutant cases of TT had significantly higher MTX serum levels when compared with the other genotypes ( Table 1 ) and required significantly longer time for elimination of methotrexate (p=0.011, Table 2 ). While hematologic toxicities, hepatotoxicities or number of febrile neutropenic episodes did not differ according to the genopypes, TT genotypes had significantly higher MTX levels and higher incidence of nephrotoxicity. Among them, two required therapeutic plasma exchange for prolonged exposure to high levels of methotrexate. Table 1.

When high dose methotrexate is administered to the patients with TT genoptype, close monitoring for the nephrotoxicity seems to be required.
