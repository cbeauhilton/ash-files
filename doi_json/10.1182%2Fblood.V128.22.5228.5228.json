    "abstract_text": "Background Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a complex disease caused by various genetic alterations. Some prognosis-associated cytogenetic aberrations or gene mutations such as FLT3 -internal tandem duplication (ITD), t(8;21)(q22;q22)/ RUNX1-RUNX1T1 , and inv(16)(p13q22)/ CBFB-MYH11 have been found and used to stratify the risk. Numerous gene mutations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AML, including mutations of DNMT3A, IDH1/2, TET2 and EZH2 in addition to RAS, KIT, NPM1, CEBPA and FLT3 in the recent development of massively parallel sequencing technologies. However, even after incorporating these molecular markers, the prognosis is unclear in a subset of AML patients. Recently, NUP98-NSD1 fusion gene was identified as a poor prognostic factor for AML. We have reported that all pediatric AML patients with NUP98-NSD1 fusion showed high expression of the PR domain containing 16 ( PRDM16 ; also known as MEL1 ) gene, which is a zinc finger transcription factor located near the breakpoint at 1p36. PRDM16 is highly homologous to MDS1/EVI1 , which is an alternatively spliced transcript of EVI1 . Furthermore, PRDM16 is essential for hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and remarkable as a candidate gene to induce leukemogenesis. Recent reports revealed that high PRDM16 expression was a significant marker to predict poor prognosis in pediatric AML. However, the significance of PRDM16 expression is unclear in adult AML patients. Methods A total of 151 adult AML patients (136 patients with de novo AML and 15 patients with relapsed AML) were analyzed. They were referred to our institution between 2004 and 2015 and our collaborating center between 1996 and 2013. The median length of follow-up for censored patients was 30.6 months. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed using the 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR System with TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix and TaqMan Gene Expression Assay. In addition to PRDM16 , ABL1 was also evaluated as a control gene. We investigated the correlations between PRDM16 gene expression and other genetic alterations, such as FLT3 -ITD, NPM1 , and DNMT3A , and clarified the prognostic impact of PRDM16 expression in adult AML patients. Mutation analyses were performed by direct sequence analysis, Mutation Biased PCR, and the next-generation sequencer Ion PGM. Results PRDM16 overexpression was identified in 29% (44/151) of adult AML patients. High PRDM16 expression correlated with higher white blood cell counts in peripheral blood and higher blast ratio in bone marrow at diagnosis; higher coincidence of mutation in NPM1 (P = 0.003) and DNMT3A (P = 0.009); and lower coincidence of t(8;21) (P = 0.010), low-risk group (P = 0.008), and mutation in BCOR (P = 0.049). Conversely, there were no significant differences in age at diagnosis and sex distribution. Patients with high PRDM16 expression tended to be low frequency in M2 (P = 0.081) subtype, and the remaining subtype had no significant differences between high and low PRDM16 expression. Remarkably, PRDM16 overexpression patients were frequently observed in non-complete remission (55.8% vs. 26.3%, P = 0.001). Patients with high PRDM16 expression tended to have a cumulative incidence of FLT3 -ITD (37% vs. 21%, P = 0.089) and MLL -PTD (15% vs. 5%, P = 0.121). We analyzed the prognosis of 139 patients who were traceable. The overall survival (OS) and median survival time (MST) of patients with high PRDM16 expression were significantly worse than those of patients with low expression (5-year OS, 17% vs. 32%; MST, 287 days vs. 673 days; P = 0.004). This trend was also significant among patients aged <65 years (5-year OS, 25% vs. 48%; MST, 361 days vs. 1565 days, P = 0.013). Moreover, high PRDM16 expression was a significant prognostic factor for FLT3 -ITD negative patients aged < 65 years in the intermediate cytogenetic risk group (5-year OS, 29% vs. 58%; MST, 215 days vs. undefined; P = 0.032). Conclusions We investigated the correlations among PRDM16 expression, clinical features, and other genetic alterations to reveal clinical and prognostic significance. High PRDM16 expression was independently associated with non-CR and adverse outcomes in adult AML patients, as well as pediatric AML patients. Our finding indicated that the same pathogenesis may exist in both adult and pediatric AML patients with respect to PRDM16 expression, and measuring PRDM16 expression was a powerful tool to predict the prognosis of adult AML patients.
