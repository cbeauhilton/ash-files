    "abstract_text": "Despite the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitor and CAR-T cell therapies, the prognosis for Ph+ and Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia remains poor. In the present study, we show the role of the Scribble protein in both lymphoid and myeloid leukemogenesis. The polarity protein Scribble is a member of the basal polarity complex, which is down-regulated in many cancers, suggesting a possible tumor suppressor role, especially in so-called cancer initiating cells. Its effect and mechanisms of activity in leukemic cell fate along with its potential activity on leukemic initiating cells have only been recently started to elucidated. Using interferon-responsive inducible (Mx1-Cre) Scribble-deficient mice, we have characterized the role of Scribble in both retroviral transduction, transplantation animal models and binary, inducible stem cell initiated (Scl-tTA/TRE-BCR-ABL) serial propagation models of BCR-ABL induced leukemia. We found that Scribble expression is upregulated at both transcriptional and translational levels in p210- or p190-BCR-ABL induced leukemic progenitors. In vitro, leukemic colony formation was impaired in Scribble deficient leukemic progenitors (~48% reduction; p\u2264 0.05, compared to Wt leukemic progenitors) demonstrating that Scribble is important for leukemogenesis. In vivo, the deletion of Scribble abrogates the development of myeloproliferative disease induced by p210-BCR-ABL (median survival: 70 vs 47 days in Scribble deficient and Wt chimeric mice, respectively; p\u22640.05); and significantly impairs B-cell lymphoid leukemogenesis induced by p190-BCR-ABL (median survival: 80 vs 60 days for Scribble deficient and Wt chimeric animals, respectively). Mechanistically, BCR-ABL activates the apical polarity regulator Cdc42 in leukemic progenitors and this activation is inhibited by the deficiency of Scribble. The deficiency of Cdc42 does not impair leukemogenesis but the combined deficiency of Cdc42 and Scribble restores the in vivo survival (median survival: 47 days, p\u22640.01 compared to Scribble deficient mice) in chimeric p190-BCR-ABL+ leukemic mice to levels similar to wild-type leukemic cells. These data indicate that Scribble-deficient leukemogenesis is dependent on oncogene induced Cdc42 activity in lymphoid progenitors. Furthermore, Scribble deficiency in leukemic progenitors increases the activation of the AMPK/mTORC1 signaling pathway and the protein expression and transcriptional activity of its downstream effector hypoxia-inducing factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1). HIF-1\u03b1 silencing by constitutive shRNA expression or inducible deletion in Scribble deleted B-lymphoid leukemic cells restored leukemic progenitor clonogenic efficiency (CFU average: 52 vs 110 per 1,000 B220+/EGFP+ BM cells, in Scribble and double Scribble/HIF-1\u03b1 deficient, respectively; p\u22640.01) and B-lymphoid leukemogenesis in vivo (median survival of 62 days; p\u22640.05 compared with Scribble deficient chimeric animals). In addition, double deficiency of Scribble and HIF-1\u03b1 restored AMPK/mTORC1 signaling to Wt leukemic levels. This data indicates that Scribble is a negative regulator of HIF-1\u03b1 expression and activity, and the restoration of HIF-1\u03b1 expression and activity to normal leukemic levels is necessary to restore leukemogenesis. Altogether, our data indicates that Scribble is a positive regulator of oncogenesis in leukemic progenitors, in vitro and in vivo, through Cdc42 and HIF-1\u03b1 activities.
