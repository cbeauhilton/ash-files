    "abstract_text": "Abstract 404 To characterize the genomic events associated with distinct subtypes of AML, we used whole genome sequencing to compare 24 tumor/normal sample pairs from patients with normal karyotype (NK) M1-AML (12 cases) and t(15;17)-positive M3-AML (12 cases). All single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions and deletions (indels), and cryptic structural variants (SVs) identified by whole genome sequencing (average coverage 28x) were validated using sample-specific custom Nimblegen capture arrays, followed by Illumina sequencing; an average coverage of 972 reads per somatic variant yielded 10,597 validated somatic variants (average 421/genome). Of these somatic mutations, 308 occurred in 286 unique genes; on average, 9.4 somatic mutations per genome had translational consequences. Several important themes emerged: 1 ) AML genomes contain a diverse range of recurrent mutations. We assessed the 286 mutated genes for recurrency in an additional 34 NK M1-AML cases and 9 M3-AML cases. We identified 51 recurrently mutated genes, including 37 that had not previously been described in AML; on average, each genome had 3 recurrently mutated genes (M1 = 3.2; M3 = 2.8, p = 0.32). 2) Many recurring mutations cluster in mutually exclusive pathways, suggesting pathophysiologic importance . The most commonly mutated genes were: FLT3 (36%) , NPM1 (25%) , DNMT3A (21%) , IDH1 (18%) , IDH2 (10%) , TET2 (10%) , ASXL1 (6%), NRAS (6%) , TTN (6%) , and WT1 (6%). In total, 3 genes (excluding PML-RARA ) were mutated exclusively in M3 cases. 22 genes were found only in M1 cases (suggestive of alternative initiating mutations which occurred in methylation, signal transduction, and cohesin complex genes). 25 genes were mutated in both M1 and M3 genomes (suggestive of common progression mutations relevant for both subtypes). A single mutation in a cell growth/signaling gene occurred in 38 of 67 cases ( FLT3, NRAS, RUNX1, KIT, CACNA1E, CADM2, CSMD1 ); these mutations were mutually exclusive of one another, and many of them occurred in genomes with PML-RARA , suggesting that they are progression mutations. We also identified a new leukemic pathway: mutations were observed in all four genes that encode members of the cohesin complex ( STAG2, SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21 ), which is involved in mitotic checkpoints and chromatid separation. The cohesin mutations were mutually exclusive of each other, and collectively occur in 10% of non-M3 AML patients. 3) AML genomes also contain hundreds of benign \u201cpassenger\u201d mutations . On average 412 somatic mutations per genome were translationally silent or occurred outside of annotated genes. Both M1 and M3 cases had similar total numbers of mutations per genome, similar mutation types (which favored C>T/G>A transitions), and a similar random distribution of variants throughout the genome (which was affected neither by coding regions nor expression levels). This is consistent with our recent observations of random \u201cpassenger\u201d mutations in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) clones derived from normal patients (Ley et al manuscript in preparation), and suggests that most AML-associated mutations are not pathologic, but pre-existed in the HSC at the time of initial transformation. In both studies, the total number of SNVs per genome correlated positively with the age of the patient (R 2 = 0.48, p = 0.001), providing a possible explanation for the increasing incidence of AML in elderly patients. 4) NK M1 and M3 AML samples are mono- or oligo-clonal . By comparing the frequency of all somatic mutations within each sample, we could identify clusters of mutations with similar frequencies (leukemic clones) and determined that the average number of clones per genome was 1.8 (M1 = 1.5; M3 = 2.2; p = 0.04). 5) t(15;17) is resolved by a non-homologous end-joining repair pathway, since nucleotide resolution of all 12 t(15;17) breakpoints revealed inconsistent micro-homologies (0 \u2013 7 bp). Summary: These data provide a genome-wide overview of NK and t(15;17) AML and provide important new insights into AML pathogenesis. AML genomes typically contain hundreds of random, non-genic mutations, but only a handful of recurring mutated genes that are likely to be pathogenic because they cluster in mutually exclusive pathways; specific combinations of recurring mutations, as well as rare and private mutations, shape the leukemia phenotype in an individual patient, and help to explain the clinical heterogeneity of this disease.
