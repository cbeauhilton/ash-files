    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4287 Purpose: To evaluate safety, feasibility and anti-leukemia potential of haploidentical KIR-L mismatched natural killer (NK) cell infusion in elderly high risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Patients and Methods: Thirteen patients (5 active disease, 2 molecular relapse and 6 complete remissions) with median age 62 years (range 53\u201373) received NK cell infusion after immunosuppressive chemotherapy (fludarabine/cyclophosphamide), followed by interleukin-2. Highly purified CD56 + CD3 - NK cells from haploidentical KIR-L mismatched donors were used. The median number of infused NK cells was 2.74 \u00d7 10 6 /Kg. T cells were less than 10 5 /Kg. NK cell chimerism, phenotyping, and functional assays were performed. Results: No significant toxicity, including graft versus host disease, related to NK cell infusion was observed. Among patients with active disease, 1/5 obtained transient complete remission (CR), whereas 4/5 patients had no clinical benefit. Both patients in molecular relapse obtained CR, which lasted 9 and 4 months. Three/6 patients in morphologic CR are disease-free after 34, 32 and 18 months. Donor NK cells were demonstrated in the peripheral blood (PB) of all evaluable patients with a peak at day 10 after infusion and, in some cases, also in the bone marrow (BM). NK alloreactivity was demonstrated in vivo by the detection of donor-derived postinfusion NK clones capable of killing recipient targets. Conclusion: Infusion of purified CD56 + CD3 - NK cells is feasible and safe in elderly high risk AML patients. Adoptively transferred NK cells, which can be detected in PB and BM after infusion, are alloreactive against recipient cells and may induce an anti-leukemic activity.
