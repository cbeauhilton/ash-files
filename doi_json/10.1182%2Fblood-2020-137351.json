    "abstract_text": "Background. In multiple myeloma (MM), the role of minimal residual disease (MRD) by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) is well established (H. Avet-Loiseau et al. IMW 2019, S. Oliva et al. EHA 2020). Aims. The aims of this analysis were the evaluation of (1) the rate of conversion from MRD-positivity (MRD-pos) to MRD-negativity (MRD-neg) with MFC and NGS during maintenance and (2) the impact on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of MRD-neg with both techniques in different subgroups including different treatment arms. Methods. Newly diagnosed (ND)MM patients (pts) aged \u226465 years were randomized (R1) to receive carfilzomib (K)-lenalidomide (R)-dexamethasone (d) induction followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) and KRd consolidation (KRd_ASCT), 12 KRd cycles (KRd12), or K-cyclophosphamide(C)-d induction followed by ASCT and KCd consolidation (KCd_ASCT). After consolidation, pts were further randomized (R2) to KR vs R maintenance. MRD was assessed every 6 months (m) by 8-color second-generation flow cytometry (sensitivity 10 -5 ) in pts with \u2265very good partial response (VGPR). In pts achieving at least a complete response (\u2265CR), MRD was also assessed by NGS at the same time points (Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, US-WA; sensitivity 10 -5 -10 -6 ). Logistic regression analysis adjusted for International Staging System (ISS) stage (I vs II/III) and R1 was performed to evaluate the conversion rate from MRD-pos to MRD-neg during maintenance (KR vs R). PFS and OS of MRD-neg vs MRD-pos in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population were evaluated. For these analyses, MFC-pos pts included those who were positive by MRD plus those <VGPR, whereas NGS-pos pts included those who were MRD-pos plus <CR (excluding CR pts not evaluable by NGS). 1-year sustained MRD-neg by MFC and NGS was evaluated in pts with at least 2 samples available at least 1 year apart. Results. Rates of MRD-neg by MFC and NGS before maintenance in the 3 induction/consolidation arms have been previously presented (S. Oliva et al. EHA 2020). At R2, 65% of randomized pts were MRD-neg by MFC (equally distributed in the 2 arms); 39% (48/123) of MRD-pos pts turned MRD-neg after a median of 7.6 m (IQR 6.5-12): 46% (29/63) in KR vs 32% (19/60) in R (OR 2.27; P =0.04) arms. At R2, 72% of pts evaluable for CR were MRD-neg by NGS (equally distributed in the 2 arms); 33% of MRD-pos pts (15/45) became MRD-neg at 10 -5 : 39% (9/23) in KR vs 27% (6/22) in R arms (=NS). In the ITT analysis, after a median follow-up of 45 m from R1, pts who were MRD-neg before maintenance by both techniques showed a superimposable prolonged PFS and OS vs pts who were MRD-pos: 3-year PFS was 80% vs 52% (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.26-0.49 P <0.001) in MFC-neg vs MFC-pos pts and 83% vs 55% (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.22-0.52, P <0.001) in NGS-neg vs NGS-pos pts (Fig. 1A); 3-year OS was 96% vs 79% (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.14-0.42 P <0.001) in MFC-neg vs MFC-pos pts and 97% vs 82% in NGS-neg vs NGS-pos pts (HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.15-0.61, P <0.001). The favorable impact of MRD-neg on PFS was confirmed in all subgroups, in particular in the high-risk setting. PFS in 1-year sustained MRD-neg was superimposable between MFC and NGS (4-year PFS 88% by MFC and 94% by NGS at 10 -5 ). The impact of pre-maintenance MRD negativity by MFC on PFS was explored in different treatment arms: 3-year PFS was longer in KRd_ASCT vs KRd12 and in KRd_ASCT vs KCd_ASCT arms; MRD-pos pts showed a similar PFS in the 3 arms. The same trend was shown by NGS MRD negativity: 3-year PFS was longer in KRd_ASCT vs KRd12 and in KRd_ASCT vs KCd_ASCT arms. A longer PFS was observed in pre-maintenance MRD-neg pts who were randomized to KR vs R both by MFC (HR 0.51, P =0.02) and NGS (HR 0.38, P =0.03); similar features were observed in MRD-pos pts (Fig. 1B). Conclusions. KR maintenance induced a high rate of conversion from MRD-pos to MRD-neg both by MFC and NGS. The outcomes of pts who were MRD-neg by MFC and NGS at 10 -5 were similar, as well as those of pts with 1-year sustained MRD-neg both by MFC and NGS. These clinical findings confirmed a high degree of concordance between these two techniques. MRD-neg pts receiving KRD_ASCT showed a longer PFS (88% at 3 years) than pts receiving KRd12 and KCd_ASCT. KR vs R significantly prolonged PFS even in pts who were MRD-neg before maintenance.
