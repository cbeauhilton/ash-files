    "abstract_text": "Host dendritic cells (DC) are thought to be essential in the induction of acute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT. Human peripheral blood contains various circulating DC precursors including CD11c+ myeloid preDC (mDC), CD14+ monocytic DC precursors (CD14+ preDC) and plasmacytoid preDC (pDC). In this study we employed flow cytometry to enumerate both mDC (lin-, HLA-DR+ and CD11c+), mono-DC (CD14+, CD45 bright) and pDC (lin-, HLA-DR+ and CD123+) numbers in the blood of patients receiving an allogeneic HSCT. Fifty consecutive patients undergoing HSCT from HLA-matched either related (n=28) or unrelated (n=22) donors were enrolled in the study. The stem cell source was bone marrow in all unrelated donors, and G-CSF mobilized PBSC in related donors. Indications to transplant were AML (n=12), ALL (n=11), MM (n=10), CML (n=7), NHL (n=6) and HD (n=4). 13 patients (26%) received reduced dose conditioning regimens (RIC). All patients received CsA and MTX as GVHD prophylaxis. Moreover, 26 patients (52%) received ATG before transplant. mDC and pDC PB counts were significantly lower in patients as compared to 28 age-matched healthy controls [8.8 cells/microL (25 th to 75 th percentile 3.5\u201314.5) mDC, and 2.8 (1.3\u20135.5) pDC, vs 15.5 (12.1\u201325.1) and 8.6 (5.6\u201313.1), respectively] (p 310/mL (median value) had a higher actuarial probability of developing acute GVHD grade II\u2013IV than patients with lower CD14+ preDC counts (61% vs 15%). No correlation was observed between pretransplant recipient PB mDC, pDC or CD14+ preDC counts and chronic GVHD. These findings demonstrate that blood levels of DC precursors may represent an important biomarker correlating with a higher risk of developing aGVHD. Based on these results, future studies will exploit clinical strategies aimed at depleting or inactivating host preDC before allotransplant as a means of GVHD prophylaxis.",
