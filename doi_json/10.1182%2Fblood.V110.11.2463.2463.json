    "abstract_text": "We investigate the frequency of the human leukocyte antigen DR15 (HLA-DR15) allele in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We used polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) to detect HLA-DR15 in the peripheral blood of patients with MDS(n = 76) and healthy controls (n = 227). The frequency of HLA-DR15 in MDS patients (40.8%) was significantly higher than in controls (13.7%; P < 0.01). The diagnoses of refractory anemia/refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RA/RARS) accounted for 77.4% (24/31) and 62.2% (28/45) of the DR15-positive and the DR15-negative patients, respectively (difference not statistically significant). Although no statistically significant difference was observed, some trends were observed: IPSS low-risk MDS (IPSS score, \u22641) accounted for 80.6% of the DR15-positive patients compared to 64.4% among the DR15-negative patients. However, the difference between the numbers of DR15-positive and DR15-negative patients with chromosomal abnormalities was not statistically significant. Nevertheless, poor risk chromosome abnormalities (according to IPSS), were present in only 1 DR15-positive patient, while such abnormalities were present in 8 DR15-negative patients. In addition, the proportions of DR15-positive and DR15-negative patients with more than 5% blasts in marrow were 19.4% and 31.1%, respectively. Peripheral blood pancytopenia occurred in 51.6% of DR15-positive, and in 40.0% of DR15-negative patients. Although the HLA-DR15 allele appeared to be present more frequently in patients less than 60 years of age, this association was not significant. The frequency of HLA-DR15 was significantly higher in patients with MDS than in healthy controls suggesting the possibility that HLA-DR15 is associated with an enhanced susceptibility to develop MDS. The fact that HLA-DR15 was predominantly noted in patients with RA/RARS and low IPSS scores, suggested that HLA-DR15 might be associated more with bone marrow failure and less with leukemic transformation. clinical/experimental characteristics in HLA-DR15 positive or negative MDS patients Cohort .
