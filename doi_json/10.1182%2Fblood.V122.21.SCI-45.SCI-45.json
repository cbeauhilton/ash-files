    "abstract_text": "Clinical observations revealed that congenital neutropenia (CN) patients harboring either ELANE or HAX mutations have similar bone marrow morphology, responses to G-CSF therapy, requirements of G-CSF dosages, and the risk of developing leukemia. Therefore, we suggested a common pathomechanism of defective G-CSFR-triggered granulopoiesis downstream of both mutated genes in these patients. We identified severely diminished expression and functions of the transcription factors lymphoid enhancer binding factor-1 (LEF-1) and C/EBPa in myeloid cells of CN patients, in comparison to healthy individuals and patients with cyclic neutropenia (CyN). LEF-1 expression was abrogated in patients harboring either ELANE or HAX1 mutations, which suggested LEF-1 as a possible common candidate factor for defective G-CSFR signaling. We further identified a mechanism of the diminished LEF-1 expression downstream of HAX1 or ELANE mutations. HAX1 is HCLS1-Associated protein X1. HCLS1 is Hematopoietic Cell-Specific Lyn Substrate 1. We found that HCLS1 protein is expressed at high levels in human myeloid cells and is phosphorylated upon stimulation with G-CSF. HCLS1 interacted with LEF-1 protein, inducing nuclear translocation of LEF-1, LEF-1 autoregulation, C/EBPa activation, and granulocytic differentiation. In CN patients with HAX1 mutations, we found profound defects in the G-CSF-triggered phosphorylation of HCLS1, subsequently leading to abrogated nuclear transport and autoregulation of LEF-1. In CN patients with ELANE mutations we detected severely reduced levels of the natural inhibitor of neutrophil elastase (NE), and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI). We demonstrated the important role of SLPI in myeloid differentiation by activation of Erk1/2 phosphorylation and subsequent phErk1/2-triggered tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the LEF-1 protein. Therefore, the direct link between ELANE mutations and diminished LEF-1 expression was established: in these patients LEF-1 protein expression is diminished due to the reduced levels of SLPI. We further evaluated how G-CSF treatment overcomes maturation arrest of granulopoiesis in CN patients despite the absence of LEF-1 and C/EBPa in myeloid cells. We identified nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) as an essential enzyme mediating G-CSF-triggered granulopoiesis in healthy individuals and in CN patients. Treatment of healthy individuals with G-CSF resulted in upregulation of NAMPT levels in myeloid cells and in plasma. NAMPT and NAD + amounts were even more dramatically elevated by G-CSF treatment of CN individuals. The molecular events triggered by NAMPT included elevation of NAD + , NAD + -dependent activation of protein deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), binding of SIRT1 to the myeloid specific transcription factors C/EBP\u03b1 and C/EBP\u03b2, and activation of these transcription factors. In CN patients, C/EBP\u03b1 expression is severely diminished; therefore \u201csteady-state\u201d granulopoiesis could not be activated. G-CSF treatment induces expression of C/EBP\u03b2 in these patients via NAMPT and SIRT1 and operated via the \u201cemergency\u201d pathway. We also investigated the patterns of acquisition of leukemia-associated-mutations in 31 CN patients developing leukemia using next-generation DNA deep sequencing. Intriguingly, 20 of the 31 patients (64.5%) demonstrated mutations within RUNX1. The majority of patients with RUNX1 mutations (85%) had acquired CSF3R mutations. Other leukemia-associated mutations in the patients with RUNX1 mutations were found infrequently. Cytogenetics of the leukemic cells revealed that 10 patients with RUNX1 mutations developed monosomy 7, and six patients had trisomy 21. Single cell analysis in two patients revealed that RUNX1 and CSF3R mutations were segregated in the same malignant clone. Functional studies demonstrated proliferative advantage of CD34 + cells transduced with mutated RUNX1 and CSF3R . By analysis of the leukemogenic role of the defective G-CSFR signaling in CN patients we identified a significant and sustained elevation in the levels of phospho-STAT5 in hematopoietic CD34 + cells of CN patients which were even higher in CN/ acute myeloid leukemia patients. The other possible reason for the leukemogenic transformation could be elevated NAMPT/SIRT-triggered deacetylation of tumor supressor protein p53, proto-oncogene FOXO3a and Akt proteins.
