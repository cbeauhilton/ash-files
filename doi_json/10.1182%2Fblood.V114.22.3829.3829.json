The US03 study was designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of the oral iron chelator, deferasirox, administered once-daily in pts with lower-risk MDS. 173 pts at 45 centers in the US and Canada enrolled in the 1-year core phase of the study and 83 pts participated in the 2-year extension phase. We now present data from pts who have completed 2 years of deferasirox treatment. Methods US03/E is an ongoing, Phase II, open-label, 3-year trial in pts with Low- or Int-1 IPSS-risk MDS. Eligible pts had transfusional iron overload (serum ferritin \u22651000 \u03bcg/L and >20 units of RBC transfusions) with serum creatinine (SCr) \u22642-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN). Initial deferasirox dose was 20 mg/kg/day, which could be increased up to 40 mg/kg/day based on tolerability and response criteria. Serum ferritin and creatinine were monitored monthly. Baseline features 83 pts entered the extension study; mean age was 68 years (range 21\u201390) with 41 men and 42 women. IPSS risk groups were Low in 23 (28%) pts and Int-1 in 60 (72%). Mean serum ferritin level at the beginning of the extension phase was 2496 \u03bcg/L (range 546\u20137770); mean lifetime number of transfusions was 83.6 (range 20\u2013364) and the mean duration of transfusion therapy was 4.6 (2\u201312) years. 18 (22%) pts were receiving growth factors (8 darbepoetin, 5 G-CSF, 4 epoetin alpha and 1 tranexamic acid), and 13 pts were receiving other MDS specific therapies (5 decitabine, 4 azacitidine, 3 lenalidomide, and 1 hydroxyurea). The calculated creatinine clearance at extension study entry was normal (>80 mL/min) in 20 (25%) pts and abnormal in 59 (75%), including mild renal insufficiency (51\u201380 mL/min) in 41 (52%) pts, moderate (30\u201350 mL/min) in 16 (20%) and severe in 2 (3%). Two-year efficacy results At the time of this analysis, 54 pts completed 2 years of treatment (1 year in the core and one year in the extension portion of the study). Over 24 months, the mean dose of deferasirox was 22.8 mg/kg/day and the mean transfusion rate was 4 units/month. Serum ferritin results are available from 50 pts who have received deferasirox for 100 weeks (Figure). The mean serum ferritin level decreased significantly from study baseline: 3002 to 2069 \u03bcg/L at 100 weeks (\u0394=933 \u03bcg/L; P <0.001, signed rank test).

Three patients experienced an erythroid response (major, n=2; minor n=1); only one who achieved a minor response received MDS treatment with darbepoetin. Others included major platelet response (n=1; not receiving MDS treatment), major neutrophil response (n=1; not receiving MDS treatment) and one combined major platelet and neutrophil response while receiving G-CSF and decitabine treatment. Safety Of 83 pts, 35 (42%) discontinued from the study: 8 (9.6%) due to abnormal laboratory values (increase of creatinine 6, thrombocytopenia 1, and neutropenia and thrombocytopenia 1), 8 (9.6%) due to adverse events (gastrointestinal symptoms 3, Clostridium dificile infection 1, renal dysfunction 1, cardiac symptoms 1, unknown 1), 11 (13.2%) due to serious AEs with an outcome of death (none of the deaths were related to deferasirox) and 8 (9.6%) due to MDS progression/AML. Of 67 pts with normal baseline SCr, 24 (30%) had an increase in SCr values above the ULN on at least two occasions (3.0 mg/dL max SCr). Of 16 pts with abnormal baseline SCr, one had an increase to above the ULN on at least two occasions. New onset of grades 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 15 (18%) and 29 (35%) pts, respectively. Conclusions In pts with lower-risk MDS and iron overload, deferasirox significantly reduced serum ferritin over 2 years. Deferasirox was generally well tolerated over 2 years. The final year of this study will continue to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of deferasirox in these lower-risk MDS pts with iron overload.
