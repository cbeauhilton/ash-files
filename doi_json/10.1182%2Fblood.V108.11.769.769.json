    "abstract_text": "Taspase1 was identified as the threonine endopeptidase that cleaves MLL for proper Hox gene expression in vitro . To investigate its functions in vivo , we generated Taspase1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Taspase1 deficiency results in non\u2212cleavage (nc) of MLL and MLL2 and homeotic transformations. Remarkably, our in vivo studies uncover an unexpected role of Taspase1 in cell cycle. Taspase1 \u2212/\u2212 animals are smaller in size. Taspase1 \u2212/\u2212 MEFs exhibit impaired proliferation and acute deletion of Taspase1 leads to a marked reduction of thymocytes. Taspase1 deficiency incurs down\u2212regulation of Cyclin Es , As , and Bs and up\u2212regulation of p16 Ink4a . We show that MLL and MLL2 directly target E2Fs for Cyclin expression. The un\u2212cleaved precursor MLL displays a reduced histone H3 methyl transferase activity in vitro . Accordingly, CHIP assays demonstrate a markedly decreased histone H3 K4 tri\u2212methylation at Cyclin E1 and E2 genes in Taspase1 \u2212/\u2212 cells. Furthermore, MLL nc/nc;2nc/nc MEFs are also impaired in proliferation. Our data are consistent with a model in which precursor MLLs, activated by Taspase1, target to Cyclins through E2Fs to methylate histone H3 at K4, leading to activation. Lastly, Taspase1 \u2212/\u2212 cells are resistant to oncogenic transformation and Taspase1 is over\u2212expressed in many cancer cell lines. Thus, Taspase1 may serve as a target for cancer therapeutics."
