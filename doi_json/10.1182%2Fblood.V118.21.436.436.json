    "abstract_text": "Abstract 436 Background: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that is characterized by the hallmark t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation, as well as a high number of secondary chromosomal alterations. Further, a small number of genes such as TP53 , ATM and CCND1 have been reported to be recurrently mutated in MCL, but do not fully explain the biology and do not adequately account for the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, response to treatment and prognosis. The aim of this study was to discover new somatic mutations that could contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of MCL. Methods: In our discovery cohort, we sequenced the transcriptomes of 18 clinical samples (11 diagnostic and 7 progression biopsies) and 2 mantle cell lymphoma-derived cell lines (Mino and Jeko-1). For this purpose, whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing was performed on RNA extracted from fresh frozen tissue. We assembled an extension cohort of 103 diagnostic patient samples and 4 additional cell lines (Rec-1, Z-138, Maver-1, JVM-2), and performed Sanger sequencing of NOTCH1 exons 26, 27 and 34 on genomic DNA. We further exposed the 6 cell lines to 1 \u03bcM of the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor XXI (compound E) for 7 days and measured cellular proliferation with an EdU incorporation assay. Survival analysis was carried out in the 113 patients with diagnostic biopsies and available outcome data. Results: NOTCH1 mutations were found in 14 out of 121 patient samples (11.6%) and in 2 out of 6 cell lines, Mino and Rec-1 (33.3%). The majority of these mutations (12 out of 14) lie in exon 34 that encodes the PEST domain of NOTCH1 and consist of either small frameshift-causing indels (10 cases) or nonsense mutations (2 cases). These mutations are predicted to cause truncations of the C-terminal PEST domain. To gain further insight into functional relevance, we treated 6 cell lines with compound E, an inhibitor of the \u03b3-secretase complex that plays a critical role in the release of the intracellular domain of NOTCH1 after ligand-induced activation. In Rec-1, that harbours a NOTCH1 mutation, we observed a significant decrease in proliferation (mean percentage of cells in culture incorporating EdU decreasing from 47.5% to 1.4%, p<.001). No effect of compound E was observed in Mino, the other cell line with a NOTCH1 mutation, nor in the 4 cell lines that are wild type for NOTCH1 . Outcome correlation analysis showed that NOTCH1 mutations are associated with poor overall survival (1.56 versus 3.86 years respectively, p=.001), but not with significantly shortened progression-free survival (0.88 versus 1.73 years respectively, p=.07). Discussion: We have identified recurrent mutations in NOTCH1 in a subset of patients with MCL (11.6%). The frequency and the pattern of mutations are strikingly similar to what has recently been reported in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the other major CD5 positive B-cell malignancy (Nature, 2011 Jun 5, 475:101\u2013105 and J Exp Med, 2011 Jul 4, 208:1389\u20131401). NOTCH1 mutations are associated with adverse prognosis as evidenced by shortened overall survival. This latter finding, however, should ideally be validated in a larger and uniformly treated cohort. Finally, the sensitivity of the Rec-1 cell line to compound E suggests that NOTCH1 mutations could serve as the target for tailored therapy in mantle cell lymphoma.
