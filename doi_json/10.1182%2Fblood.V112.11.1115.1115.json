    "abstract_text": "It is thought that 2 x 10 6 /kg is the minimum CD34+ cell dose needed for autotransplantation, while the ideal dose is generally accepted to be 5 x 10 6 /kg. Whether infusing cell doses higher than 5 x 10 6 /kg offers additional benefit is unknown. The relationship between time to standard engraftment endpoints (0.5 x 10 9 /L Neutrophils \u2013 ANC 0.5, 1 x 10 9 /L neutrophils \u2013 ANC 1.0, 20 x 10 9 /L platelets \u2013 PLT 20, and 50 x 10 9 /L platelets \u2013 PLT 50) and the CD34+ cell doses infused was explored in 754 autografts performed for malignant diseases in adult patients: 32 leukemia, 195 lymphoma, 514 myeloma, 13 other. The conditioning regimens used were standard (high-dose melphalan, BEAM, busulfan-cyclophosphamide, or busulfan-etoposide in >90%). All patients received G-CSF after stem cell infusion: from day 0 in 90%. Cell dose calculations were based upon ideal body weight. Table 1 shows the distribution of the CD34+ cell ranges infused.

It is clear that increasing CD34+ cell doses hasten platelet recovery significantly through the entire range of CD34+ cell dose ranges studied. Increasing CD34+ cell doses appear to hasten neutrophil recovery too, but the benefit seems to level off beyond 10 x 10 6 CD34+ cells per kg. The effect of a CD34+ cell dose of \u22642 x 10 6 /kg was not analyzed because only 7 patients received this small quantity of cells.

Table 2: Significance of differences in time to engraftment These data suggest that increasing CD34+ cell numbers hasten hematologic recovery \u2013 even beyond a cell dose of 15 x 10 6 /kg. It remains to be seen if more rapid engraftment resulting from infusion of higher number of CD34+ cells results in practical benefits such as more robust/durable engraftment, decreased toxicity, and improved survival.",
