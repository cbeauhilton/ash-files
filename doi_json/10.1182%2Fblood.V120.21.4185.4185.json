    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4185 Background: Since the clinical implication of anti-lymphocyte globulin (ATG/ALG) in allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is not fully understood, we tried to identify the clinical impact of ATG/ALG in patients with acute leukemia who received allo-SCT in Japan. Patients and Methods: We analyzed patients with ALL (n=5494) and AML (n=8115) who received first allogeneic SCT from 1983 to 2009 with (n=356) or without (n=13253) ATG/ALG. Their stem cell sources were bone marrow (BM, n=9056), peripheral blood (PB, n=1918), and cord blood (CB, n=2575) and they were transplanted at 1st complete remission (CR1, n=5681), 2nd CR (CR2, n=2495), and advanced stages (>CR3, n=5033). Results: Five year overall survival (5y OS) of all patients with or without ATG/ALG was 33.6% vs 44.5%, respectively (P<0.001) and multivariate analysis showed that ATG/ALG significantly reduced acute GVHD (P<0.001, HR=1.980) as well as chronic GVHD (P<0.001, HR=1.894). According to stem cell sources, 5y OS with or without ATG/ALG was 35.8% vs 47.5% (P<0.001) in BM, 34.7% vs 37.6% (P=0.067) in PB and 18.3% vs 39.9% (P<0.001) in CB. By multivariate analysis, ATG/ALG significantly reduced A-GVHD (P=0.005, HR=1.565) but decreased OS (P=0.004, HR=0.729) in BM, it reduced A-GVHD (P<0.001, HR=2.376) and C-GVHD (P<0.001, HR=2.691) but lowered engraftment (P=0.046, HR=0.810) in PB, and it increased TRM (P=0.004, HR=0.437) with decreased OS (P=0.011, HR=0.576) in CB. In Haplo transplantation (SCT from 2 or 3 antigens of HLA mismatched family donor, n=337), multivariate analysis showed that ATG/ALG did not affect the relapse, TRM and OS but, it significantly lowered engraftment (P=0.002, HR=0.602), and reduced A-GVHD (P<0.001, HR=2.622) as well as C-GVHD (P<0.001, HR=3.834). In contrast to these results, ATG/ALG did not affect the relapse rate irrespective of stem cell source or diagnosis. Conclusion: In allogeneic stem cell transplantation for patients with ALL and AML, ATG/ALG contribute in reducing acute and chronic GVHD without affecting relapse rates but it was a risk factor of OS for patients who received BM or CB.
