    "abstract_text": "Introduction Multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable malignancy despite important recent advances in treatments. Neo-vascularization entails a crucial aspect of interactions between neoplastic plasma cells (PCs) and their microenvironment. Without it, MM would be unable to grow and progress, and would probably regress to a low-mass steady-state comparable to monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). To overcome drug resistance and improve clinical response to novel therapeutic approaches halting both PC growth and the increased bone marrow (BM) microvascular density are needed. In this setting, monoclonal antibodies against MM-specific cell surface antigens represent a promising therapeutic approach, which is however hampered by a lack of appropriate membrane target structures expressed across all MM cells. The Eph receptors, a large family of receptor tyrosine kinases, have been implicated in many processes involved in malignancy, including alteration of the tumour microenvironment, and in angiogenesis, in both of which EphA3 likely plays an active role. Interestingly, the over-expression of EphA3 is sufficient to confer tumorigenic potential, although probably further mechanisms can occur to abnormally activate the receptor. A first-in-class engineered IgG1 antibody targeting the EphA3 was developed and it is now under phase I clinical trials in USA and Australia for the treatment of EphA3 over-expressing hematological myeloid malignancies refractory to conventional treatment. Methods We investigated the EphA3 role in MM patients in order to define whether it may represent a potential new molecular target for a novel therapeutic approach with a specific anti EphA3 monoclonal antibody. The EphA3 expression was studied through a comparative proteomic analysis between BM endothelial cells (ECs) of patients with MM (MMECs) or with MGUS (MGECs), of control subjects (normal ECs). Moreover, the effects of anti EphA3 antibody in MM were studied in vitro and in vivo in a MM xenograft mouse model. After written informed consent, BM aspirates were collected from 26 MM and 6MGUS patients. Normal ECs were derived from 5 BM aspirates of subjects with anemia due to iron or vitamin B12 deficiency. We analyzed both mRNA and protein levels of EphA3 in normal ECs, MGECs and MMECs and in MM cell lines by absolute RT-PCR and by WB coupled to immunofluorescence and FACS analysis respectively. Immunoistochemistry was also performed on MM BM biopsies. The biological effects of EphA3 targeting were studied in vitro silencing (siRNA) the EphA3 mRNA in MMECs and using the anti EphA3 antibody testing them in series of in vitro functional assays including viability, apoptosis, adhesion, migration, wound healing and angiogenesis tests. We further examined the inhibitory capacity of anti-EphA3 Ab on tumor growth in SCID mice bearing MM tumor cell xenografts. Finally, we assessed morphology, vessel density, and apoptosis of excised xenotransplanted tumors. Results Briefly, our data showed that EphA3 mRNA and protein levels are progressively increased from ECs to MGECs, reaching the highest values in MMECs. EphA3 stained intensely and diffusely MM microvessels and PC in MM BM biopsies. The EphA3siRNA MMECs revealed a protein level reduction of approximately 80% when compared to the control. We not detected viability or apoptotic defects, whereas in vitro adhesion, migration and angiogenesis inhibition was evident when compared to the not silenced counterpart. The anti EphA3 antibody inhibited MMECs migration and reduced in vitro MM angiogenesis. In particular, tumour masses developed in xenograft mice treated with anti-EphA3 Abs were smaller in size and showed foci of ischemic-hemorrhagic necrosis, in association with a significant ( P < 0.05) reduction in the number of intact tumor microvessels. The proliferative activity was not significantly different from that observed in tumors from untreated or control isotype treated mice, while the apoptotic index was significantly ( P < 0.05) increased in comparison with tumors from both groups of mice. Conclusions In this study we have characterized the role of the EphA3in MM patients, providing in vitro and in vivo experimental evidences that support the possibility of using EphA3 as a new molecular target for MM.
