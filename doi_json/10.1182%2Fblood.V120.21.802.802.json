    "abstract_text": "Abstract 802 Background: Ruxolitinib is a potent oral JAK1 & JAK2 inhibitor that has demonstrated superiority over traditional therapies for the treatment of MF. In the two phase 3 studies, ruxolitinib demonstrated rapid and durable reductions in splenomegaly and improved disease-related symptoms and quality of life compared with placebo (COMFORT-I) and best available therapy (BAT; COMFORT-II) for pts with or without the JAK2 V617F mutation. Change in JAK2 V617F allele burden (%V617F) as a metric of molecular response to treatment in JAK2 V617 F\u2013positive pts was investigated as an exploratory endpoint. Previously, we reported allele burden reductions in pts receiving ruxolitinib in the COMFORT-II study and demonstrated a positive correlation with reduction in spleen volume after 24 and 48 wk of treatment (Vannucchi, et al. Haematologica. 2012); here, we evaluate the correlation between changes in %V617F and spleen size reduction after 72 wk of ruxolitinib therapy. Methods: COMFORT-II is a randomized (2:1), open-label, phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib (n = 146) compared with BAT (n = 73) in pts with primary MF (PMF), post\u2013polycythemia vera MF (PPV-MF), and post\u2013essential thrombocythemia MF (PET-MF). Allele burden was measured from blood samples using allele-specific quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using the method outlined in Levine et al, 2006, using an Applied Biosystems ABI 7900 real-time PCR analyzer. Pts were stratified by absolute reduction in %V617F (< 10%, 10% to < 20%, \u2265 20%) and results were correlated with achievement and duration of a \u2265 35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans. Results: Overall, 110 (76%) pts in the ruxolitinib group and 49 (71%) pts in the BAT group were JAK2 V617 F\u2013positive at baseline. More pts in the ruxolitinib arm had \u2265 10% V617F reductions compared with BAT at wk 48 (Table; 41% \\(2868\\) vs 5% \\(122\\) \u2060 ) and at wk 72 (40% \\(2153\\) vs 0). The majority of reductions \u2265 20% were gradual and progressive over the course of the study (Figure); 2 pts had rapid initial reductions in allele burden that were sustained over 72 wk, from absolute %V617F of 48% and 45% at baseline to < 10% at wk 72. The majority of patients who achieved a \u2265 20% reduction at wk 48 maintained their reduction at wk 72. Compared with wk 48, 4 additional pts were in the \u2265 20% group at wk 72: 1 pt achieved a > 20% reduction at wk 48 but the data were not available at the time of the 48-wk analysis, 2 pts did not have data at wk 48, and 1 pt achieved a 15% reduction at wk 48 that improved to a 21% reduction by wk 72. Among pts who achieved a \u2265 20% reduction in allele burden, 39% had PMF, 39% had PPV-MF, and 22% had PET-MF; this distribution was similar to that of the overall study population. In the ruxolitinib arm, significantly more pts with a \u2265 20% V617F reduction achieved a ' 35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume compared with pts with a < 10% reduction at both wk 48 (79% vs 30%) and wk 72 (69% vs 31%). Pts with a \u2265 20% reduction in allele burden maintained their spleen volume reductions from baseline out to 72 wk. In the 10% to < 20% group, a greater proportion of pts showed increases in spleen volume from nadir but spleen volumes still remained much reduced from baseline. Conclusions: Patients who received ruxolitinib had larger reductions in JAK2 V617F allele burden compared with BAT. %V617F reductions were gradual over the course of the study and continued between wk 48 and 72 in some pts. In JAK2 V617 F\u2013positive pts, reductions in %V617F were associated with spleen responses; in pts with a \u2265 20% reduction, spleen volume reductions were sustained out to 72 wk. These results, along with findings from COMFORT-I and the phase 1/2 study, suggest that ruxolitinib has the potential to alter the course of disease through a reduction in the burden of JAK2 V671 F\u2013mutated cells.
