    "abstract_text": "CG'806 is a non-covalent pan-FMS like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)/ Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) multi-kinase inhibitor. This small molecule was designed to inhibit the wild type (WT) and C481S mutant forms of BTK, as well as the WT and mutant forms (including the internal tandem duplication, ITD) of the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase. Previously (2017 AACR Hematologic Malignancies abstract # 25 and #44), CG'806 was shown to have nM potency against FLT3 mutation-driven (including ITD and point mutations in tyrosine kinase domain) human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) primary patient cells, and in cultured human (eg. MV4-11 and MOLM-13) and mouse (Ba/F3) AML cell lines. CG'806 inhibited FLT3 signaling, induced apoptosis, and eradicated MV4-11 tumors with no observed toxicity in murine xenograft models. Because AML cells demonstrate extreme heterogeneity in gene expression and because FLT3 mutations account for no more than 30% of AML patients, the effect of CG'806 was further evaluated in AML cells without FLT3 mutations. Immunoblotting demonstrated that CG'806 potently decreased phospho-BTK, phospho-aurora kinases A/B/C and phospho-H3S10 without affecting FLT3 activity in AML cells having low/normal expression levels of homozygous WT FLT3 (eg. KG-1 and NOMO-1). Measurement of BrdU incorporation by flow cytometry demonstrated that CG'806 induced G2/M cell cycle arrest or polyploidy and subsequent apoptosis in FLT3 WT AML cell lines. Interestingly, CG'806 was found to induce G0/G1 cell cycle arrest but not polyploidy in FLT3-ITD driven MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cells with no effect on activity of BTK or aurora kinases at concentrations that completely inhibited FLT3 signaling (FLT3/STAT5/ERK). These findings indicate that the molecular mechanism of cell killing by CG'806 is context-dependent and varies in different AML subtypes. Evaluation of enzyme inhibitory activity (IC 50 ) against 583 kinase enzymes, as well as binding affinities (Kd) with 483 kinase proteins, revealed pM to low nM IC 50 and Kd values for CG'806 against the FLT3, BTK, AURK, c-Src, c-Met, c-Ret, DDR, TRK and STE/MAPK families of kinases. The ability of CG'806 to target multiple families or clusters of kinases is responsible for its broad efficacy in different AML subtypes driven by different genomic aberrations. Together, these findings illustrate the ability of CG'806 to inhibit entire FLT3 family of kinases, BTK and the AURK families and pathways that are operative in AML, thereby supporting the development of CG'806 for treatment of patients with FLT3-ITD and other subpopulations of patients with AML.
