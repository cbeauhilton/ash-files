    "abstract_text": "Background Appropriate animal models for hematological malignancies are highly attractive, because they allow the study of the tumor biology and underlying disease mechanisms. They also constitute a major prerequisite for rapid bench-to-bedside translation of investigational anticancer therapies. To validate our multiple myeloma patient (pt)-derived xenograft (MM PDX) model (Schueler et al, Expert Opin Biol Ther, 2013), we systematically analyzed a panel of MM PDX with regard to their sensitivity towards standard of care treatment and compared these data with the pts' clinical outcome. Methods Bone marrow (BM) cells of 11 MM pts were implanted intratibialy (i.t.) into 103 NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2R\u03b3null (NOG) mice (n= 6-18 / pt sample). Mice were treated according to pts' therapy with VCD (Bortezomib, Cyclophosphamide, Dexamethasone), or to evaluate additional treatment options with Rd (Lenalidomide, Dexamethasone). Tumor growth and antitumoral activity in mice were assessed in tumor-bearing mice and compared to untreated control mice as well as to pts' response. Tumor growth in the mouse model was monitored by whole-body fluorescence-based in-vivo-imaging (IVI) using CF750-labeled \u03b1-HLA ABC antibody before and during treatment as well as 24h after last treatment cycle as described (Schueler J. PLOSone 2013). Mock-injected animals served as negative controls. Engraftment of human MM cells in murine organs was confirmed by flow cytometry and patho-histological analyses (immunostaining) at the end of the study. Results The pt cohort included a typical MM clientele for referral centers, with a median age of 75 years (range 56-85), median BM infiltration of 80% (20-90), and high- and standard-risk cytogenetics in 5 and 6 pts, respectively. All pts had advanced disease with Durie&Salmon stage III and active/symptomatic MM. All pts received VCD after diagnosis and BM sampling. MM cell engraftment could reliably be determined from experimental day 10 on in all 11 MM PDX models, at all assessed sites, namely within the BM, spleen and peripheral blood (PB) of recipient mice. Individual pt samples displayed distinct tumor growth patterns in vivo. Fluorescence intensity of engrafted murine organs ranged from 2- to 15-fold compared to mock injected control mice. Mean IVI signals in BM of recipient mice were 10-fold higher as compared to spleen signals, qualifying the BM niche as the preferred homing localization of pts' MM cells. Of note, both injected and non-injected BM sites were infiltrated by MM cells 10 days after tumor cell injection. Engraftment of human MM cells in the respective murine organs was confirmed by flow cytometry (HLA ABC, CD138, CD38) and histology and verified MM engraftment via both methods, confirming prior reports (Sch\u00fcler PLOSone 2013; Groen Blood 2012;120:e9-16, Overdijk MAbs. 2015;7:311-21). The murine engraftment capacity was independent of MM type, disease stage, BM infiltration and cytogenetics of the donor pt. VCD was applied to 9 different MM PDX models and induced partial remission (PR; defined as at least 50% reduction of murine tumor load in BM, spleen and/or PB) in 5 out of 9 tested MM PDX models, whereas 2 cases each showed stable disease (SD) or progression (PD). The response rates in the mouse avatars mirrored the clinical outcome of the respective MM pts in 8/9 cases; only one MM pt showed serological and clinical PR, whereas the corresponding mice displayed SD. Rd induced PR in 1 and PD in a second MM PDX model, underlining the feasibility of MM PDX for drug screening approaches. Conclusions Due to the complex tumor biology, murine models of MM are still challenging. Our data support the preclinical rationale to use i.t.-injected NOG mice, since they closely resemble clinical MM with respect to symptoms, disseminated disease sites and response to anticancer treatment. Possible applications for the MM mouse avatars include development of new anticancer drugs as well as definition of biomarker strategies and selection of treatment options for individual pts with relapsed/refractory MM. The data of our preclinical study may serve as a useful future strategy to guide treatment decisions in refractory pts. The suitability as a drug development tool will be additionally determined performing treatment experiments with novel agents, e.g. elotuzumab or daratumumab.
