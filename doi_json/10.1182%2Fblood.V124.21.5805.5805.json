    "abstract_text": "Liver injury associated with veno-occlusive disease and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a frequent and severe complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and remains an important cause of transplant-related mortality. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been evaluated for the prevention and treatment of refractory GVHD. However, poor cell viability has limited the therapeutic capacity of mesenchymal stromal cell therapy in vivo . In this study, we genetically engineered C57BL/6 mouse bone marrow MSCs using ex vivo retroviral transduction to overexpress Akt1, a serine threonine kinase and pro-survival signal protein, and tested the hypothesis that Akt1-expressing MSCs (Akt1-MSCs) are more resistant to apoptosis and can ameliorate acute liver injury induced by concanavalin A (ConA) in BALB/c mice. Cell proliferation and apoptosis analyses showed that, under both regular culture and high concentration IFN-\u03b3 (100 ng/mL) stimulation conditions, Akt1-GFP-MSCs had proliferation and survival (anti-apoptotic) advantages with down-regulated apoptosis pathways, compared to control GFP-MSCs. Twenty-four hours after receiving lethal dose of ConA (40 mg/kg, intravenous) (N=10 each group), no mouse survived, with or without 1x10 6 Akt1-MSCs or GFP-MSCs administration (intravenous); however, 3 and 1 survived in the 5\u00d710 6 Akt1-MSCs group and 5\u00d710 6 GFP-MSCs groups, respectively. In subsequent sub-lethal dose ConA (20 mg/kg) experiments, compared to GFP-MSCs, mice received Akt1-MSCs administration had significantly lower serum AST, ALT, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 levels and less histopathological abnormalities. In addition, Akt1-MSCs treated mice had significantly higher serum concentrations of IL-10, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). In vivo imaging showed that, hepatic fluorescence signal in sub-lethal ConA+Akt1-MSCs group was significantly stronger than ConA+GFP-MSCs group on day 0, and persisted up to 14 days, whereas the signal in ConA+GFP-MSCs, Akt1-MSCs and GFP-MSCs groups was negligible on both day 7 and day 14. Thus, bone marrow derived MSCs genetically enhanced with Akt1 had survival advantage in vitro and in vivo , and have the potential to be a potent therapy for prevention and amelioration of GVHD-associated liver impairment. Further translational pre-clinical studies are ongoing to further determine the efficacy, dosage and timing of administration of Akt1-MSCs in animal models.
