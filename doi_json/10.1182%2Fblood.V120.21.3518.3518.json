    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3518 Within the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, BM mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) provide leukemia cells with a rich environment that serves as a sanctuary and protects them from chemotherapeutic agents. Interactions between leukemia cells and BM-MSC are thought to change the behavior of both stroma and leukemia cells resulting in an increased resistance to standard drugs. To discover interaction-induced changes in BM-MSCs that might promote microenvironment-mediated chemoresistance we used genome-wide gene expression profiling to study normal-donor BM-MSCs co-cultured with REH cells, a pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line. Upregulated genes in normal-donor BM-MSCs by co-culture included many cytokines and chemokines and implicated activation of NF-\u03baB in BM-MSCs. Similar results were obtained by co-culturing normal-donor BM-MSCs with OCI-AML3 cells, an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line. Increased expression of NF-\u03baB target genes in BM-MSCs was also induced by co-culture with primary cells from ALL and AML patients, suggesting that NF-\u03baB activation is a common consequence of leukemia-stroma interaction. Blocking canonical-pathway NF-\u03baB activation by overexpressing a super-repressor form of I\u03baB\u03b1 in BM-MSC, significantly reduced stroma-mediated chemoresistance to vincristine (VCR) of leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo using an extramedullary bone marrow model. When small-molecule IKK\u03b2 inhibitors (MLN3316 and CDDO-Me) were used in co-cultures, blocking canonical-pathway NF-\u03baB activation in ALL cell lines (REH or RS4;11) as well as BM-MSCs, the apoptotic effects of VCR on leukemia cells were further increased. Conclusion: results indicate that leukemia cells activate NF-\u03baB in stromal cells and that such activation is in turn essential to promote survival of leukemia cells during chemotherapy. Targeting NF-\u03baB in BM-MSC may ameliorate stroma-mediated chemoresistance and help in eliminating BM-resident leukemia cells. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
