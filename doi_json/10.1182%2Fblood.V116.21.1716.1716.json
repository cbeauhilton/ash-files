    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1716 p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (p90RSK2) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays an active role in diverse cellular processes, including gene expression, cell proliferation, and survival. We previously demonstrated that RSK2 signaling plays a key role in the pathogenesis and disease progression of leukemogenic FGFR3 associated hematopoietic malignancies, including FGFR3-expressing t(4;14) multiple myeloma and TEL-FGFR3-expressing t(4;12)(p16;p13) peripheral T cell lymphoma. In this study, we found that p90RSK2 is commonly activated in diverse leukemia cell lines expressing different leukemogenic tyrosine kinases, including K562 (BCR-ABL), Molm14 and Mv4;11 (FLT3-ITD), HEL (JAK2 V617F), and EOL-1(FIP1L1-PDGFR alpha). We next examined the role of RSK2 in myeloid transformation induced by BCR-ABL and FLT3-ITD due to their high frequency of occurrence in CML and AML, respectively. Interestingly, although RSK2 is activated by BCR-ABL in both stably transduced Ba/F3 cells and K562 human leukemia cells, we found that genetic deficiency of RSK2 does not affect the pathogenesis or disease progression of myeloproliferative disease induced by BCR-ABL in a murine bone marrow transplant (BMT) model using wild type or RSK2-/- donor bone marrow cells. This finding suggests that RSK2 is dispensable for BCR-ABL induced myeloproliferative disease. Moreover, targeting RSK2 by treatment with potent and highly specific RSK inhibitor fmk did not effectively induce apoptosis in K562 human leukemia cells expressing BCR-ABL, or in primary leukemia cells from BCR-ABL positive CML patients. In contrast, we found that targeting RSK2 may represent an effective therapy to treat patients with FLT3-ITD positive AML. Treatment with fmk induced significant apoptotic cell death in Molm14 and Mv4;11 human leukemia cells expressing FLT3-ITD, as well as in primary leukemia cells from FLT3-ITD positive AML patients. In consonance with these results, FLT3-ITD induced T-cell lymphoma in a BMT assay using RSK2-/- donor bone marrow cells, phenotypically distinct from the myeloproliferative disease induced by FLT3-ITD using wild type donor bone marrow cells. These results suggest that RSK2 is required for FLT3-ITD induced hematopoietic transformation, likely playing a role in pathogenesis and lineage determination. Together these findings suggest that the role of RSK2 in hematopoietic transformation may depend on different upstream oncogenic signals mediated by different leukemogenic tyrosine kinases. Our data also demonstrate that RSK2 may represent an alternative therapeutic target in the treatment of FLT3-ITD positive leukemia. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
