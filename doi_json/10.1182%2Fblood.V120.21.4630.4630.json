    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4630 Efficacy, tolerability and dosing of a VWF/FVIII concentrate may differ in paediatric, adults, and elderly patients. It is therefore reasonable to collect and evaluate clinical data of patients from different age groups and to look into differences in treatment and reason for treatment with VWF/FVIII concentrate. A cohort of 120 patients suffering from all types of von Willebrand's disease (VWD) from an on-going German post-marketing surveillance study was analysed for age-related differences in treatment with a high-purity, double virus inactivated VWF/FVIII concentrate (wilate \u00ae ). Results: Thirteen children up to 12 years of age and 14 patients being 65 or older were treated for prophylaxis, haemorrhages or peri-operatively. Obvious deviations were found in general condition, bleeding locations and types of surgeries for the elderly patients. Further, the data provide evidence of age group-related differences regarding reason for administration (see table 1 ) and dosages administered. The efficacy and tolerability of wilate \u00ae treatment in children and elderly was as high as in the total group. Table 1. Number of patients having received injections for specified reason  .

However, larger cohorts are required to confirm these first findings of the non-interventional study \u201cWilate SET\u201d. Disclosures: Hegener: Octapharma AG: Employment.
