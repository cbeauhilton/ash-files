    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4349 BACKGROUND: Massive bleeding and subsequent coagulopathy are responsible for 35% of deaths in trauma patients. Hemodilution during resuscitation may worsen the coagulopathy and perpetuate bleeding. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood samples from healthy donors were diluted (30\u201360%) using crystalloids (saline, Ringer\u2019s lactate, Plasmalyte\u2122) or colloids (6%hydroxyethylstarch (HES130/0.4), 5% human albumin, and gelatin). The impact of hemodilution on platelet adhesion, thrombin generation (TG), and clot viscoelastic properties by thromboelastometry (TEM) was analyzed. Effects of fibrinogen (Fbn), prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs), rFVIIa, or cryoprecipates (cryo) on hemodilution were also assessed. RESULTS: Hemodilution caused a significant decrease in platelet interaction that was not improved by the addition of any of the plasma derivatives. A decrease in TG and important alterations of TEM were also observed. HES130/0.4 was the expander with the most deleterious action. TG was significantly enhanced by PCCs and their combination with Fbn whereas rFVIIa only slightly accelerated it. Fbn restored the alterations of TEM caused by hemodilution including those more deeply altered by HES 130/0.4. The combination of Fbn with PCC or rFVIIa did not have an additional effect in TEM. Cryo significantly improved the alterations caused by hemodilution on TG and TEM parameters. Effects of cryo on TG disappeared after ultracentrifugation, suggesting that contaminating microvesicular material could account for this effect. CONCLUSION: Hemostatic alterations caused by hemodilution are multifactorial and affect both blood cells and coagulation. In our in vitro approach, HES 130/0.4 seemed to exert a more deleterious effect on hemostasis. None of the concentrates improved platelet-mediated hemostasis, although they always showed variable beneficial effects on coagulation parameters. Our data indicate that PCC, rFVIIa and cryo enhance or accelerate thrombin generation. Fbn concentrates could be useful to preserve blood clotting abilities during fluid resuscitation of critically ill patients without exposing them to enhanced thrombin generation.
