    "abstract_text": "Post-transcriptional control of gene expression plays important roles in defining normal and pathological cellular phenotypes. Amongst mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation, RNA binding proteins (RBPs) have recently been shown to play important roles. However, in vivo roles for RBPs are not well understood. Here, we identified the RBP IGF2BP3 to be specifically overexpressed in MLL-rearranged B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), which constitutes a subtype of this malignancy associated with poor prognosis and a risk of high relapse. IGF2BP3 was required for the survival of B-ALL cell lines, and knockdown led to decreased proliferation and increase apoptosis. In addition, enforced expression of IGF2BP3 in murine bone marrow transplant assays caused a proliferation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and a skewing of hematopoietic development to the B-cell/myeloid lineage. Using cross-link immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing, we uncovered the transcriptome regulated by IGF2BP3; including novel direct targets, MYC and CDK6. These were regulated following experimental alteration of IGF2BP3 expression in vivo , and are regulated via elements within their 3'untranslated regions. Hence, IGF2BP3 mediated targeting of oncogenic transcripts may represent a critical pathogenetic mechanism operant in MLL-rearranged B-ALL, highlighting IGF2BP3 and its cognate RNA binding partners as potential therapeutic targets in this disease.
