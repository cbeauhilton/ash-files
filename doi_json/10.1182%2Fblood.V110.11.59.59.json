    "abstract_text": "TEL-AML1 fusion is the most frequent, defined genetic abnormality in paediatric cancer and is usually an early or initiating and pre-natal event in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Transformation results in the generation of a persistent pre-leukaemic clone, which converts to frank ALL post-natally (at 1-15years) following the acquisition of secondary genetic alterations. The mechanism by which the transcriptional dysregulation imposed by TEL-AML1 impacts on the pre-leukaemic phenotype and disease natural history is unknown. Using regulated expression of TEL-AML1, we show that, in murine progenitor cells, this protein blocks the TGF\u03b2 response pathway including the critical regulator of cell cycle inhibition, p27 . This inhibition facilitates the selective expansion of otherwise more slowly expanding TEL-AML1 progenitor cells. The mechanism of action of TEL-AML1 appears to operate downstream of SMAD2/3 phosphorylation (by TGF\u03b2 signalling) and involves binding of a transcriptional repressor complex to TGF\u03b2 target genes. In transgenic E\u03bc TEL-AML1 mice, we show that early pro-B cells (but not pre-B cells) are selectively expanded and appear less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of TGF\u03b2 than equivalent wild-type cells. Finally, we show that expression of TEL-AML1 in human cord blood progenitor cells leads to the expansion of a candidate pre-leukaemic stem cell population with an early B lineage phenotype (CD34+/CD38-/CD19+) that has a selective growth advantage in the presence of TGF\u03b2."
