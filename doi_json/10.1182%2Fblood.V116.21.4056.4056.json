    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4056 Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy characterized by the expansion of a plasma cell (PC) clone that localizes to the bone marrow (BM). Myeloma cells and BM stromal cells both produce soluble factors promoting the survival and progression of MM. Interleukin-(IL)-16 is involved in regulating migration and proliferation of normal leukocytes, however, it has been unclear whether IL-16 also plays a role in the pathophysiology of human cancers. Methods: Using an antibody array we screened supernatants of myeloma cell lines for the presence of a variety of cytokines/chemokines. We confirmed IL-16 expression in myeloma cell lines as well as in malignant PC and BM plasma from MM patients applying real-time PCR, western blots, ELISA, and flow cytometry. We applied inhibitory RNA to analyze IL-16 function and we used anti-IL-16 antibodies to evaluate possible therapeutic options for MM. Results: We found IL-16 to be strongly overexpressed in the BM of myeloma patients. Myeloma cell lines as well as primary tumor cells from MM patients constitutively expressed IL-16 RNA and protein and spontaneously secreted soluble IL-16. Functional analyses revealed that IL-16 supports the proliferation of myeloma cells. Accordingly, silencing of IL-16 expression had an anti-proliferative effect on the tumor cells. Most importantly, the application of a monoclonal antibody directed against IL-16had a strong growth-inhibiting influence on myeloma cells. Conclusions: These findings suggest that cytokine IL-16 is an important growth-promoting factor in MM and might represent a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for this incurable human malignancy.
