    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5129 Introduction Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-induced disorder. If a pregnant woman suffered from preeclampsia, her worse developed-placenta might result in growth retardation of the fetus, and in the most severe cases, it would cause fetal and maternal death. Several previous studies showed that circulating thromboxane A 2 in preeclampsic women was higher than that of normal pregnant women, and higher thromboxane A 2 level might induce thrombosis and hypertension in these patients. Thus, thromboxane A 2 was thought to be an important metabolite relevant to the development of preeclampsia. Materials and Methods In order to clearly clarify the roles of thromboxane A 2 on preeclampsia, wild type and thromboxane A 2 synthase knockout pregnant mice were fed with drinking water containing high concentration of sodium chloride. The effect of thromboxane A 2 on preeclampsia was observed by measuring blood pressure, urinary protein, systemic edema in pregnant mice, and placenta weight, fetal weight, fetal size and fetal sections were also measured and stained. Results In the groups of pregnant mice fed with high salt, maternal body weight, fetal size and fetal weight were severely decreased in wild type mice as compared to thromboxane A 2 synthase knockout mice. Furthermore, abnormal cell degeneration was observed in fetus of wild type pregnant mice, but less in thromboxane A 2 synthase knockout fetus. Conclusions These results demonstrate that knockout pregnant mice were more resistant to high salt treatment, implying the roles of thromboxane A 2 on the development of maternal and fetal defects during high salt treatment.
