    "abstract_text": "Abstract 580 Generating a large number of pure, functional immune cells that can be used in human patients has been a major challenge for NK cell-based immunotherapy. We have successfully established a cultivation method to generate human NK cells from CD34+ cells isolated from donor-matched cord blood and human placental derived stem cells, which were obtained from full-term human placenta. This cultivation method is feeder-free, based on progenitor expansion followed by NK differentiation supported by cytokines including thrombopoietin, stem cell factor, Flt3 ligand, IL-7, IL-15 and IL-2. A graded progression from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HSC) to committed NK progenitor cells ultimately results in \u223c90% CD3-CD56+ phenotype and is associated with an average 10,000-fold expansion achieved over 35 days. The resulting cells are CD16- and express low level of KIRs, indicating an immature NK cell phenotype, but show active in vitro cytotoxicity against a broad range of tumor cell line targets. The in vivo persistence, maturation and functional activity of HSC-derived NK cells was assessed in NSG mice engineered to express the human cytokines SCF, GM-CSF and IL-3 (NSGS mice). Human IL-2 or IL-15 was injected intraperitoneally three times per week to test the effect of cytokine supplementation on the in vivo transferred NK cells. The presence and detailed immunophenotype of NK cells was assessed in peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), spleen and liver samples at 7-day intervals up to 28 days post-transfer. Without cytokine supplementation, very few NK cells were detectable at any time-point. Administration of IL-2 resulted in a detectable but modest enhancement of human NK cell persistence. The effect of IL-15 supplementation was significantly greater, leading to the robust persistence of transferred NK cells in circulation, and likely specific homing and expansion in the liver of recipient mice. The discrete response to IL-15 versus IL-2, as well as the preferential accumulation in the liver have not been previously described following adoptive transfer of mature NK cells, and may be unique for the HSC-derived immature NK cell product. Following the in vivo transfer, a significant fraction of human CD56+ cells expressed CD16 and KIRs indicating full physiologic NK differentiation, which appears to be a unique potential of HSC-derived cells. Consistent with this, human CD56+ cells isolated ex vivo efficiently killed K562 targets in in vitro cytotoxicity assays. In contrast to PB, spleen and liver, BM contained a substantial portion of human cells that were CD56/CD16 double negative (DN) but positive for CD244 and CD117, indicating a residual progenitor function in the CD56- fraction of the CD34+ derived cell product. The BM engrafting population was higher in NK cultures at earlier stages of expansion, but was preserved in the day 35- cultured product. The frequency of these cells in the BM increased over time, and showed continued cycling based on in vivo BrdU labeling 28 days post-transfer, suggesting a significant progenitor potential in vivo . Interestingly, DN cells isolated from BM could be efficiently differentiated ex vivo to mature CD56+CD16+ NK cells with in vitro cytotoxic activity against K562. We speculate that under the optimal in vivo conditions these BM engrafting cells may provide a progenitor population to produce a mature NK cell pool in humans, and therefore could contribute to the therapeutic potential of the HSC-derived NK cell product. The in vivo activity of HSC-derived NK cells was further explored using a genetically engineered human AML xenograft model of minimal residual disease (MRD) and initial data indicates significant suppression of AML relapse in animals receiving NK cells following chemotherapy. Collectively, our data demonstrate the utility of humanized mice and in vivo xenograft models in characterizing the biodistribution, persistence, differentiation and functional assessment of human HSC-derived cell therapy products, and characterize the potential of HSC-derived NK cells to be developed as an effective off-the-shelf product for use in adoptive cell therapy approaches in AML.
