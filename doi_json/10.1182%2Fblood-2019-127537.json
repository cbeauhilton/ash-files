    "abstract_text": "Glucocorticoids (GCs) are central to the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and upfront resistance to GCs is a poor prognostic factor. We previously demonstrated that over one-third of primary patient T-ALLs are resistant to the GC dexamethasone (DEX) when cultured in the presence of interleukin-7 (IL7), a cytokine that is abundant in the microenvironment of leukemic blasts and that plays a well-established role in leukemogenesis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that GCs paradoxically induce their own resistance by promoting the upregulation of IL7 receptor (IL7R) expression. In the presence of IL7, this augments signal transduction through the JAK/STAT5 axis, ultimately leading to increased STAT5 transcriptional output. This promotes the upregulation of the pro-survival protein BCL-2, which opposes DEX-induced apoptosis. Given that IL7-induced GC resistance depends on de novo synthesis of IL7R in response to DEX, and that newly synthesized IL7R reaches the cell surface via trafficking through the secretory pathway, we hypothesized that inhibiting the translocation of nascent IL7R peptide into the secretory pathway would effectively overcome IL7-induced DEX resistance. Sec61 is a protein-conducting channel in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that is required for the cotranslational insertion of nascent polypeptides into the ER upon recognition of the signal sequence on secreted and cell surface proteins. To test the hypothesis that Sec61 inhibition could overcome IL7-induced DEX resistance, we utilized the human T-ALL cell line CCRF-CEM, which recapitulates the resistance phenotype observed in primary patient samples. Using a series of structurally distinct small molecule inhibitors of the Sec61 translocon, we demonstrated that Sec61 inhibition effectively overcomes the increase in cell surface IL7R expression in response to DEX. This occurs despite a persistent elevation in IL7R transcript expression following DEX exposure, confirming that Sec61 inhibitors act post-transcriptionally to attenuate cell surface IL7R expression. To determine whether the sensitivity of IL7R to Sec61 inhibitors is due specifically to the interaction between the IL7R signal sequence and Sec61 inhibitors, we generated IL7R constructs containing hydrophobic amino acid substitutions in the signal sequence, which are predicted to confer resistance to Sec61 inhibitors. Upon transient transfection of these constructs into HEK293T cells, we found that these mutations rendered IL7R resistant to the effects of Sec61 inhibition, confirming that the IL7R signal sequence confers sensitivity to these inhibitors. Using the Bliss independence model of synergy in CCRF-CEM cells, we demonstrated that Sec61 inhibitors potently synergize with DEX to overcome IL7-induced DEX resistance. Importantly, at concentrations at which synergy occurs, Sec61 inhibitors demonstrate no single-agent effect on cell survival, suggesting that these effects are not due to an overall reduction in secretory and membrane protein biogenesis. Furthermore, Sec61 inhibitors failed to sensitize CCRF-CEM cells to other chemotherapies used in T-ALL, none of which demonstrate IL7-induced resistance, thereby suggesting that these effects on DEX sensitivity are due specifically to the reduction in cell surface IL7R. To determine if Sec61 inhibitors prevent the DEX-induced increase in STAT5 transcription, we analyzed BCL-2 expression in cells exposed to DEX and IL7, and found that Sec61 inhibitors attenuate the increase in BCL-2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. We next analyzed a cohort of 34 primary patient T-ALL samples. As in CCRF-CEM cells, we found that specifically in those samples with IL7-induced DEX resistance, Sec61 inhibitors synergized with DEX to induce cell death in the presence of IL7. This effect occurred concomitantly with a reduction in cell surface IL7R expression and BCL-2 expression. Taken together, these data demonstrate the efficacy and feasibility of Sec61 inhibition as a novel and rational therapeutic strategy to overcome the IL7-induced DEX resistance phenotype that affects over one-third of newly diagnosed T-ALL patients.
