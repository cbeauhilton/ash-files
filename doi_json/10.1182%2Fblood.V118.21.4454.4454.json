    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4454 Introduction: CML represents 15% all of oncohematologic diseases in adults. IM changed the history of the disease. At one year of treatment, the emblematic IRIS study showed Major Cytogenetic Responses (MCyR) of approximately 87% and Complete Cytogenetic Responses (CCyR) of around 76%, with PFS to accelerated phase or blast crisis of 97.7% and 91.5%, respectively. Objective: To assess treatment characteristics and responses in a group of patients treated with IM in clinical practice. Materials and Method: 113 medical records of patients with CML diagnosed between 1998\u20132011 from two institutions in the Argentine Republic were retrospectively analyzed. Result: Mean population age was 46 years old (r 18\u201373) 65 male, 48 female. 97% in chronic phase, the rest in accelerated phase. 31% presented comorbidities at diagnosis. Cytogenetic abnormalities at diagnosis, in addition to the classic t(9:22), included: trisomy 8 and double Philadelphia chromosome in 4 tests. Only 7 patients had qualitative BCR/ABL determined at diagnosis. 25% had received interferon, patients received IM 400 mg and only 2% received 300 or 600 mg doses. 2.6% of patients did not achieve CHR. Cytogenetic responses assessed at any time of treatment were: Major: 12%, Minor 20%, Complete 51%, None 3%, 14% were not assessed. With a mean follow-up time of 46 months, the overall survival was 75%. 10% of patients progressed to BC/AP, 11 % of patients died due to disease-related causes or comorbidities. Conclusions: With a mean follow-up time of 46 months for chronic phase CML, treatment with IM achieved complete cytogenetic responses in 51% of patients, and progression occurred in 10% of patients.
