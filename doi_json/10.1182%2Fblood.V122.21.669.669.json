    "abstract_text": "Heterotypic interactions between bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and malignant B cells contribute to apoptosis-resistance of tumour cells, based on the provision of anti-apoptotic factors by stromal cells. For this reason, interference with the microenvironment may offer an alternative approach to chemotherapy to target B cell lymphomas/ leukaemias. However, the success of such treatments critically relies on specific targets expressed in the lymphoma microenvironment. We have previously reported that monoclonal B cells from patients with CLL, MCL und ALL activate and reprogram BMSCs. This activation of stromal cells is an essential prerequisite for microenvironment-mediated survival of malignant B cells and requires the induction and activation of protein-kinase C-\u03b2 in stromal cells in vitro and in vivo . This is underscored by a complete resistance of PKC-\u03b2 knockout mice to adoptively transferred B cell lymphomas from TCL1 transgenic mice (Lutzny et al. Cancer Cell. 2013 Jan 14; 23(1):77-92.). Analyses of primary CLL cells co-cultured on human or mouse BMSCs indicate that stromal cells protect malignant B cells from apoptosis primarily by enhancing the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl1, XIAP, BclXL and Bcl2A1. Knockdown of Mcl1 expressed in CLL cells further demonstrates that its expression is crucial for stroma-mediated survival even in the presence of BMSCs. Since BMSC-mediated survival and propagation of CLL depends on the kinase activity of PKC-\u03b2, we hypothesized that pharmacological inhibition of the activation of stromal cells using small molecule inhibitors against PKC-\u03b2 may display anti-leukemic effects. Here we report that the PKC-\u03b2 inhibitor enzastaurin enhances the cytotoxic effects of standard chemotherapeutic drugs and of the BCL2-inhibitor ABT737. Dose-response analyses indicate that enzastaurin potentiates the cytotoxic effects of ABT737 in a synergistic manner, rapidly causing caspase-mediated apoptosis of malignant B cells. This drug-sensitising effect of enzastaurin is mediated by inhibition of PKC-\u03b2 induced and expressed in activated stromal cells and not related to a direct cytotoxic effect on malignant B cells: PKC-\u03b2 deficient BMSCs fail to maintain high expression levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl1, XIAP and Bcl2A1 in CLL cells, which show a significantly enhanced sensitivity to ABT737 compared to CLL cells cultured on PKC-\u03b2 proficient stromal cells. These data provide evidence that PKC-\u03b2 inhibitors can therapeutically be used to abolish microenvironment-mediated survival of malignant B cells. In order to assess whether drug combinations of enzastaurin and BCL2 inhibitors demonstrate synergistic anti-lymphoma effects in vivo, we adoptively transferred malignant B cells from diseased TCL1 mice into wild-type recipient mice. Tumour-bearing mice were treated with enzastaurin, ABT199 or a combination of both drugs. Response to treatment, assessed by PET-CT scan, indicates that the combination of enzastaurin and ABT199 is superior to single agent treatment. These data indicate that malignant B cells can be sensitized to cytotoxic drugs by inhibiting the tumour-promoting effects of the lymphoma microenvironment with PKC-\u03b2 inhibitors. Our preclinical in vitro and in vivo experiments justify testing this drug combination as a new approach to leukaemia/ lymphoma therapy in a phase I/II clinical trial.
