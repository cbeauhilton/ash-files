    "abstract_text": "Objectives: To determine the support of physicians for the recently published ASCO evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis and treatment in patients with cancer (J Clin Oncol. 2015;33:654-6). Methods: ASCO key recommendations were presented as part of three CME seminars to physicians not specialized in hem/onc or hemostasis. In addition two specialists in the field discussed a list of arguments for and against each of the recommendations considering (1) quality of scientific evidence underlying each recommendation, (2) feasibility in daily practice including sensitivity to patients preferences, and (3) medicolegal implications and reimbursement aspects. After each presentation attendees were asked to fill out a questionnaire on how much they supported the ASCO recommendations and each of the pro&con arguments. Results: A total of 89 physicians attended the three meetings. 56 questionnaires were returned. The ASCO recommendations with the highest degree of support were: \u2012 Patients undergoing major cancer surgery should receive prophylaxis for 7-10 days and even 4 weeks after major abdominal or pelvic surgery with high-risk features (84% pro) \u2012 LMWH should be given for the initial treatment as well as for long-term secondary prophylaxis (80% pro). The recommendations with the lowest degree of support were: \u2012 Patients with cancer should be educated about signs and symptoms of VTE. They should be periodically assessed for VTE (59% pro). \u2012 Anticoagulation should not be used to extend survival of patients with cancer in the absence of other indications (56% pro). Conclusion: After presenting ASCO recommendations as part of CME training the degree of physicians' support was still at best moderate and sometimes even close to neutrality. In daily medical practice scientific evidence has no priority to clinical practicability, patients preferences, medicolegal aspects and cost-restrictions. Guideline authors should complement their recommendations with advice from their own practice on how to implement guidelines in daily care and how they manage financial and medicolegal restrictions. In addition there is an unmet need for more education on VTE prophylaxis and treatment among physicians not specialized in hem/onc or hemostasis who are caring for cancer patients.
