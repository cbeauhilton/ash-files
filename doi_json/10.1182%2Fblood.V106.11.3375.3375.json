    "abstract_text": "Because cell lines can be adapted to proteasome inhibition in vitro (Pfeifer G. et al., Science 283: 978\u2013981, 1999.), secondary resistance of malignant cells towards Bortezomib (Velcade\u00ae) in vivo is a likely scenario. We have succeeded to adapt the human AML cell line HL-60 to Bortezomib in vitro, so that the adapted subline (HL-60a) shows normal viability and growth rate at 40 nM Velcade\u00ae, while cell death is induced above 10nM in the parental line. We hypothesized that alternative proteolytic pathways might allow the continued proliferation and survival of Bortezomib-adapted cells, and assessed the activity-profiles of proteasomal subunits, ubiquitin-specific proteases and lysosomal cysteine proteases in a functional proteomics approach, using recently developed synthetic affinity probes. These tools for the first time allow semiquantitative visualization of the individual members of these protease families, based on their activity, in contrast to western blot which lacks activity information or to the turnover of fluorogenic substrates, which is not truly protease-specific. After 72h of culture in Bortezomib-free medium (wash out phase), HL-60a cells contained significantly reduced levels of active proteasomal \u03b21,\u03b22, and \u03b25 subunits, compared to the parental line, as confirmed by a reduced turnover of the \u03b25-selective fluorogenic substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC. A panel of 7 different ubiquitin-specific proteases (USP) was visualized in both types of cells, using the affinity probe HAUbVS. Of these, a 97 kD USP that we have identified as USP14 by mass spectrometry-based sequencing, was significantly upregulated in HL-60a cells. By contrast, the activity of lysosomal cysteine proteases remained unchanged in HL-60a cells. Because the cytosolic protease tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPPII) can partially substitute for proteasome activity in lactacystine-treated cell lines, we assessed TPPII-activity using a fluorogenic substrate. We observed a significant upregulation of TPPII-activity in HL-60a cells, compared to non-adapted controls. Inhibition of TPPII, however, was not sufficient to restore Bortezomib-sensitivity in HL-60a cells. Interestingly, the combination of Bortezomib with the HIV protease inhibitor Ritonavir induced synergistic cytotoxicity both in HL-60 and HL-60a cells. Thus, Bortezomib-resistance is accompabied by upregulation of protease activities in alternative pathways. Combining different protease inhibitors like Bortezomib and Ritonavir might be a promising option to overcome primary or secondary Bortezomib resistance.",
