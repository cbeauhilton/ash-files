    "abstract_text": "Natural killer (NK) cells represent a lineage of immune cells capable of direct cytotoxicity against tumor cells and are a critical source of key inflammatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). NK cell function is often impaired in the setting of cancer, reducing the effectiveness of the endogenous immune system. The unique biological attributes of NK cells, including multifaceted effector function, tumor cell recognition independent of antigen presentation and target cell selectivity independent of HLA-matching, has enabled NK cells from a donor to be adoptively transferred to a patient for the treatment of cancer. This safe and effective administration of donor NK cells to patients validates their potential for broad use as part of an off-the-shelf cancer immunotherapy strategy, including in combination with monoclonal antibody and checkpoint inhibitor therapies. We have previously shown that human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) can be clonally-selected, cryopreserved and banked, and that these master pluripotent cell lines (MPCLs) can be used to renewably generate large clonal populations of NK cells. The use of MPCLs represents a highly-promising, off-the-shelf approach to cell-based cancer immunotherapy, with the potential to overcome many of the challenges and limitations of patient-sourced and donor-derived cell therapies. However, to clinically and commercially enable this off-the-shelf strategy, it is essential to efficiently and reproducibly differentiate MPCLs to fully-functional NK cells using a robust and scalable process that meets regulatory requirements. Here we describe a novel paradigm for the manufacture of hiPSC-derived NK (iNK) cells consisting of a well-defined, small molecule-driven, staged protocol that enables clinical translation and is compatible with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) requirements. The manufacturing protocol is currently being transferred from the laboratories of Fate Therapeutics to Molecular and Cellular Therapeutics at the University of Minnesota, which is a state-of-the-art GMP/GTP compliant, full-service developer and manufacturer of cell- and tissue-based products. iNK cell therapy manufacture consists of four unique steps including: 1) the derivation and master cell banking of a clonal pluripotent cell line (> 95% SSEA4 + /TRA181 + hiPSCs); 2) differentiation of the clonal pluripotent cell line towards hematopoietic progenitor cells (enriched for > 80% CD34 + cells); 3) differentiation and expansion of iNKs ( Figure 1A , approximately 1,000-fold expansion in 14 days); and 4) freeze and thaw of drug product, comprised of a sufficiently pure homogenous population of iNKs ( Figure 1B , > 95% CD45 + , > 90% CD56 + , minimal CD3 + T cells). Importantly, testing at both the molecular and culture stages demonstrate that no hiPSCs exist in the final drug product (limit of detection 1 hiPSC in 1.25 million iNK cells). This novel manufacturing paradigm supports the generation of significant numbers of iNK cells: approximately 1 million-fold cell expansion is achieved in less than 50 days, such that a very small population of hiPSCs can readily produce 1x10 12 iNK cells. We estimate that this represents hundreds of doses of drug product per each manufacturing run ( Figure 1A ). The iNK cells display markedly augmented effector function relative to ex vivo expanded primary peripheral blood or cord blood NK cells with respect to cytokine release (IFN-\u03b3 and TNF) and cellular cytotoxicity against various leukemic and solid tumor-derived target cells including K562, Raji, A549 and SKOV3 ( Figure 1C ). To enable centralized manufacturing, we established a freeze and thaw strategy that supports greater than 85% viability with a recovery of greater than 80% iNK cells at twenty-four hours post-thaw. Because the freeze process uses an infusible medium formulation, we demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that the iNK cells maintain their efficacy post-thaw and can be immediately infused into patients. The manufacturing data presented herein support the filing of an Investigational New Drug application for an off-the-shelf iNK cell therapy product to treat advanced hematologic and solid tumor malignancies alone or in combination with monoclonal antibody and checkpoint inhibitor therapies.
