    "abstract_text": "The oncofetal protein, WT1, is differentially expressed in 60\u201380% of acute leukemias and CML. Previously, four peptide epitopes presented by HLA-A0201 or HLA-A2402 have been identified. We used a pool of 15-mers with 10 amino acid overlaps spanning the full sequence of WT1, loaded on autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells or EBV-transformed BLCL to sensitize and raise T cell lines from a series of normal donors expressing or not expressing HLA-A0201 or HLA-A2402. Specific 15-mers eliciting responses were identified by quantitating IFNg + CD8 + or CD4 + T cell responses to secondary stimulation with 15-mer subpools organized in a mapping grid with single overlaps. Responses against targets loaded with the identified stimulating 15-mer and sharing single HLA class I or II alleles permitted identification of restricting HLA alleles. Patients inheriting HLA-A0201 have generated CD8 + T cells in response to the complete pool which are selectively reactive against single 15-mers containing the known immunogen 252\u2013260 RMFPNAPYL. However, in certain donors, responses to 15-mer 28, containing a heretofore unreported epitope 136\u2013144 ALLPAVPSL, (which has a high predicted affinity for HLA-A0201) have been dominant. By mapping responses of T cells sensitized with the complete pool, defining the presenting HLA alleles and delineating immunogenic sequences within specific 15-mers, additional novel epitopes presented by HLA- B0801 and DRB 1 0301 have also been defined. T cells generated by this approach also lyse both peptide-loaded targets as well as primary WT1 + leukemic cells expressing the restricting HLA allele. Thus, sensitization with pools of overlapping synthetic 15-mers spanning WT1 may selectively stimulate WT1-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell lines restricted by HLA alleles other than HLA- A0201 or A2402 that are leukemocidal and therefore of potential use for adoptive immunotherapy."
