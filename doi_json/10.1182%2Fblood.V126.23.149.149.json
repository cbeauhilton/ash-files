    "abstract_text": "ATG5 is a key protein that regulates autophagy, a vital cellular process whose role in various immune cells is poorly understood. A recent report showed that the deficiency of autophagy gene Atg16l1 in host DCs increased graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). Nevertheless, the direct role of autophagy in regulating T cell alloreactivity after bone marrow transplant (BMT) is unknown. In order to investigate the role of autophagy in T cells, we first analyzed the changes in autophagosome marker LC3 upon WT T cell activation. TCR stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28, increased cytosolic LC3-I and its membrane-bound LC3-II form. Interestingly, we found that the upregulation of LC3 was predominant in dividing cells, which lead us to hypothesize that autophagy is essential for T cell proliferation. Therefore we next explored if the deficiency in autophagy impaired T cell proliferation utilizing B6 T cell-specific ATG5 knockout (ATG5 KO T cell) mouse and hydroxychloroquine (CQ, a known inhibitor of autophagy). As hypothesized, when compared with WT controls, both CQ treated WT T cells and the ATG5 KO T cells, in vitro, demonstrated a significant decrease in proliferation as demonstrated by 3H-thymidine incorporation and CFSE staining (p<0.0001) and were associated with a failure to upregulate LC3. These effects were observed after anti-CD3/CD28 TCR stimulation as well as following allogenic stimulation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) from BALB/c mice. The reduction in T cell proliferation was accompanied by a significant increase in apoptosis (p<0.0001). However it was not associated with a decrease in T-helper (TH) signature cytokines (IFN\u03b3, IL-2, IL-17, IL-4) suggesting no impact on T cell differentiation. Furthermore ATG5 deficiency also did not alter T cell activation as determined by upregulation of NFAT and ZAP70. Thus lack of autophagy lead to the decrease survival of T cell along with decreased proliferation after TCR stimulation but did not affect TH differentiation and T cell activation. Given the in vitro observations, we hypothesized that ATG5 KO T cells would also induce less GVHD following allogenic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Utilizing clinically relevant MHC-mismatched B6 \u2192 BALB/c BMT model, we lethally irradiated (800cGy) WT-BALB/c mice and transplanted 5x10 6 T cell-depleted bone marrow from WT-B6 mice along with 0.5x10 6 splenic T cells purified from ATG5 KO or WT- B6 mice. WT-BALB/c TCD BM and T cells were used for syngeneic controls. Consistent with in vitro results, ATG5 KO T cells showed decreased proliferation in vivo but showed no difference in Th1/Th17 differentiation. Allogenic animals transplanted with ATG5 KO T cells also showed a significantly improved survival (p=0.001) and reduced GVHD severity (p=0.03). Phenotypic analyses prior to BMT showed that ATG5 KO T cells show decreased CD62L and an increased expression of CD44. Because na\u00efve (CD62L+CD44-) T cells are critical for GVHD, we next explored if the observed improvement in GVHD could be due to a decreased population of these na\u00efve T cells in the transplant inoculum of ATG5 KO animals. Therefore, using the same BMT model and design, we transplanted WT-BALB/c mice 0.5x10 6 isolated splenic CD62L+ T cells only from either ATG5 KO or WT-B6 animals and observed that GVHD mortality was reduced in the allo-recipients of ATG5 KO T cells compared with WT T cells (p=0.005). To determine the potential molecular mechanism, we next hypothesized that upon activation ATG KO T cells may show alterations in pro and anti-apoptotic proteins. We observed that ATG5 KO failed to increase Bcl-2 level and showed a decrease in Bcl-XL level upon TCR stimulation compared to WT T cells. In contrast to the relative lack of anti-apoptotic proteins, they displayed similar levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins BIM, Bak and Bax. These results suggest that an imbalance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors is likely a cause for the reduced T cell expansion by ATG5 KO T cells. Our results collectively demonstrate that inhibition of autophagy decreases T cell expansion but not its differentiation in vitro and in vivo . Furthermore contrary to the aggravation of GVHD when autophagy is targeted in host DCs, it mitigated GVHD when targeted in donor T cells. Thus the net impact of manipulating autophagy after allogeneic BMT on GVHD is dependent on which immune cell subsets are being targeted. Figure 1. View large Download slide Figure 1.
