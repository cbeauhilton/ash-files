    "abstract_text": "While extensive, the genetic studies of DLBCL tumors to date have primarily focused on somatic mutations that are associated with development of lymphoma, i.e., driver mutations. Identification of key genetic events that impact and/or predict response to therapy and clinical outcome of lymphoma patients has not been accomplished. In an exploratory study, we used whole-exome sequencing to identify novel biomarkers that can predict which patients have an aggressive form of DLBCL, and therefore would likely benefit from a different and more aggressive treatment plan. Using whole-exome sequencing data from 54 newly diagnosed DLBCL patients, we evaluated the association of somatic coding single nucleotide (cSNV) and copy number (CNV) variants with aggressive DLBCL. All patients were treated with R-CHOP or immunochemotherapy, and disease aggressiveness was based on relapse, with patients classified as having aggressive disease (AD) (n=13, defined as treatment failure, relapse, or progression within 24 months of diagnosis) versus non-aggressive disease (n=41, defined as achieving at least 24 months of relapse-free survival). An in-house algorithm, patternCNV was used to detect somatic CNVs. Logistic regression was used to assess statistical significance. In the cSNV analysis, 24 genes were found to be significantly (p \u2264 0.05) associated with AD. Of these genes, CIITA (p=0.01) was previously identified as a mutational target in DLBCL and is a recurrent gene fusion partner in lymphoid cancers. Metacore analyses showed that seven of these genes, including CIITA , can be placed in the same regulatory network centered around CREB1 . Interestingly, the CREB binding protein ( CREBBP ) is a known target of pathogenic mutations in DLBCL. In the CNV analyses, we identified 245 gene amplifications and 209 gene deletions associated with AD (p \u2264 0.05). Deleted genes were localized in three major chromosomal regions, 6p22.3-6p22.1 (26 genes), 6q13-6q16.3 (31 genes), and 6q21-6q24.2 (86 genes). In the CNV amplification analysis, the genes were localized in two major chromosomal regions, 3q12.3-3q29 (90 genes) and 19q13.12-19q13.43 (122 genes). We also quantified the association of each regional deletion/amplification with patient outcome. As expected, each deleted region was univariately associated with time to relapse: 6p22.3-6p22.1 (HR = 7.19, 95% CI: 2.66-19.46, p=1.33x10 -5 ), 6q13-6q16.3 (HR = 4.44, 95% CI: 1.74-11.32, p=6.84x10 -4 ), and 6q21-6q24.2 (HR = 5.42, 95% CI: 2.12-13.87, p=9.23x10 -5 ) as well as the two amplification regions: 3q12.3-3q29 (HR = 4.60, 95% CI: 1.49-14.24, p=4.27x10 -3 ) and 19q13.12 -19q13 (HR = 13.79, 95% CI: 4.39-43.34, p=2.81x10 -8 ). Deletions at 6q21-6q24.2 have been previously reported in DLBCL and two tumor suppressor genes associated with lymphoma pathogenesis are localized in the region, TNFAIP3 (p=0.14) and PRDM1 (p=0.02), the latter of which was significantly associated with AD. However, the genes in the 6p21 locus that were most significant (p=0.002) were SLC22A16, GPR6, SOBP, MATTL24, DDO, and REV3L . SLC22A16 , which also had cSNVs in two tumors, is an organic cation transporter that has been shown to transport chemotherapeutic drugs including doxorubicin. Successful drug response has been correlated with the level of activity and expression of this transporter in tumor cells. To determine if expression of SLC22A16 would have an impact on doxorubicin transport, and may therefore impact response to R-CHOP we overexpressed either an empty vector control or SLC22A16 in OCI-Ly7 DLBCL cells, which do not express endogenous SLC22A16 mRNA. We found that OCI-Ly7 cells expressing SLC22A16 have increased 14 C-doxorubicin uptake and are more sensitive to doxorubicin-induced cell death when compared to the empty vector control cells. These data suggest that loss of SLC22A16 expression through gene deletion could impact the ability of DLBCL cells to respond to therapy and indicates an aggressive form of the disease. In summary, our data are the first to use whole exome sequencing to identify genetic variants associated with aggressive DLBCL, which will require replication in additional samples. Nevertheless, our data highlight the role for somatic CNVs in patient outcome and we biologically validate the potential impact of deletions in SLC22A16 at 6p21.
