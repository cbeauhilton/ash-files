    "abstract_text": "Introduction In our study 144 children were send to our coagulation centre with a positive anamnesis (such as haematomas or nose bleeding\u2019s) a positive family anamnesis (p.e. Mother with Menorrhagie) or a prolonged aPTT during a standardized preoperative examination. Samples and Methods We analyzed samples of 144 children by conduction the following tests: Blood count, VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, VWF:CB, Fibrinogen (Clauss), activities of FII, FV, FVII, FVIII (clotting and chromogenic), FIX, FX, FXI, FXII, FXIII. Results In 107 of 144 children (74.3%) a bleeding disorder could be detected. In those with a bleeding disorder the distribution was as followed: 23.6% had a von Willebrand disease, 27.8% had a prolonged bleeding time and 5.6% a factor XIII-deficiency. The remaining 43% hat other bleeding. disorders (e.g. FVIII-deficiency, FVII-deficiency and other mild factor deficiencies). Discussion A standardized preoperative questionnaire can be useful in clinical practice. In our study 74.3% children with one or more positive evidence in the anamnesis suffer from a bleeding disorder. It is specifically noticeable that we found in 68% of the children which mother has a menorrhagia a bleeding disorder. In 31.8% of the children we found a von Willebrand disease. In our more coagulation disorders could be detected if a standardized preoperative questionnaire would be used and if we pay more attention to children with would a mothers with menorrhagia. Conclusions Children from mothers with menorrhagia suffer more frequently from a bleeding disorder. In our patients in 75% of the children with a mother with menorrhagia a bleeding disorder was found. To avoid an unexpected bleeding during a planned surgery or a postoperative bleeding a standardized preoperative questionnaire should be performed.
