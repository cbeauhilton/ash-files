    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5062 Thrombotic events occurring before or at diagnosis of Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) are a worldwide recognized prognostic factor for the incidence of thrombosis during the follow-up of ET patients: however, these previous thrombotic events have been considered on the whole in the vast majority of studies, without further characterization. Among 1063 ET patients collected in the retrospective database of the \u201cGruppo Laziale SMPC Ph-\u201d, we revised 186 cases with a previous thrombosis and a known data of occurrence, to evaluate the role of the interval from previous thrombotic episode and the diagnosis of ET. In 95 patients (51. 1%) previous thrombotic event occurred < 24 months before diagnosis of ET (group A) while in 91 patients (48. 9%) thrombosis occurred \u2265 24 months before diagnosis of ET (group B). Clinical features of patients at diagnosis are shown in the Table:  . GROUP A . GROUP B . p .

GROUP A . GROUP B . p .

In the group A, 9 out 95 patients (9. 4%) reported thrombotic episodes (5 arterial and 4 venous) during follow-up compared to 23 out 91 patients (25. 2%) (13 arterial and 10 venous) in the group B (p=0. 004). Consequently, patients of group B had a significantly higher cumulative risk of thrombosis compared to patients of group A (p=0. 0029, CI95% 1. 5 \u2013 6. 1, RR 3. 04). In addition, it is worth of note that there was no difference in the cumulative risk of thrombosis between the patients of group A and the 877 patients without previous thrombotic events (p=0. 303, CI95% 0. 64 \u2013 3. 21, RR 1. 24) In conclusion, the prognostic role of a previous thrombotic event in ET patients seems to be related not to the occurrence per se of the event but mainly to the interval between the event and the diagnosis of ET.
