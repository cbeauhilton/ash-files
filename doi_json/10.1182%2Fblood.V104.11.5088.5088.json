    "abstract_text": "Although immunizations against microbial infections are recommended following autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), the antibody responses are often suboptimal. To assess improved immunization strategies, we tested the ability of autologous T cells that were co-stimulated ex vivo with anti-CD3 and -CD28 coated beads as part of their therapy for MM, as well as pre-ASCT immunization to enhance the antibody response to PCV post-ASCT. Subjects were randomized to receive PCV (groups 1 and 2) or no immunization (groups 3 and 4) before T cell harvest, and subsequent mobilization chemotherapy. All subjects received PCV at days 30 and 90 post-ASCT; however, groups 1 and 3 were given T cells before (day 12) post-ASCT PCV immunization, while groups 2 and 4 received T cells after PCV immunization (day 100). Patients receiving adoptive T cell therapy for MM without PCV immunization (group 5) served as controls. The results of the adoptive transfer of T cells on MM therapy are reported elsewhere. Anti-pneumococcal (Pn) antibody levels for serotypes 6B, 14, 23F, 19F were measured in sequential samples for up to 180 days for each patient by ELISA (response defined as \u2265 2-fold increase over baseline and \u2265 0.5 \u03bcg/ml) and opsonophagocytosis assay (OPA) (response defined as \u2265 1-log bacterial kill or \u2265 70% kill when \u2264 30% kill at baseline).  . .

Groups . . . . . 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 . 5 . a Numbers of evaluable subjects per group responding by ELISA to 3 or more of 4 pneumococcal serotypes tested. b Number of evaluable subjects with OPA response to 19F only.

We conclude that (1) MM patients immunized with PCV pre-ASCT respond better to PCV post-ASCT; (2) T cell administration before PCV immunization enhances protective anti-Pn antibody levels and for a longer duration. Our vaccine schedule that leads to improved PCV responses may also be used to improve the responses of ASCT patients to other microbial and perhaps cancer vaccines.
