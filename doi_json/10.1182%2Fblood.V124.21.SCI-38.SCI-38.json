    "abstract_text": "Several distinct congenital disorders can lead to tissue-iron overload with anemia including \u03b2-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. We show that intestinal absorption of iron is highly increased and significantly contributes to tissue iron accumulation in these disorders. The present work describes a novel pathway by which oxygen sensing transcription factors are highly upregulated in iron overload anemias and are subsequently essential for the increase intestinal iron absorption. Oxygen signaling is mediated through well-conserved hypoxia driven transcription factors, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1a and HIF2a. In the intestine, HIF2a directly activates divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), duodenal ferric reductase (DcytB), and Fpn1, which are iron transporters critical for adaptive changes in iron absorption. We demonstrate that HIF2a and its downstream target gene, DMT1 are essential for iron accumulation in mouse models of \u03b2-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Furthermore, studies of thalassemic mouse model with established iron overload demonstrated that loss of intestinal HIF2a and DMT1 signaling led to decreased tissue iron accumulation in the livers. Interestingly, disrupting intestinal HIF2a not only improves tissue iron accumulation, but a marked improvement of anemia was also observed. These novel findings suggests that inhibition of HIF2a signaling pathway could be a novel and robust treatment strategy for several conditions that cause iron overload with anemia.
