    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4446 The Hemophilia Unit of the Hematology Department of the National Hospital Edgardo Rebagliatti Martins- ESSALUD, is one of the most important Hemophilia Centers through the country, that assists patients not only in its jurisdiction but also a great amount referred from other institutions due the complexity of their treatment, like acquired inhibitor disorders as well as orthopedic and mayor cardiovascular surgeries and severe hemorrhages. The Hemophilia ESS A LUD system is compounded of centers in Lima (02), Callao (01) and provinces (05) (Arequipa, Chiclayo, Trujillo, Piura and Cuzco). The range of patients with new diagnosis is about 5 to 20 patients per year. The prevalence of Hemophilia in the last 5 years, accounts 83.38% patients of the global amount with coagulation disorders. Of the 331 patients in treatment, 228 (68.8%) have Hemophilia A. Considering the classification of status severity, 12.5% patients of this group belong to mild status hemophilia, 39.47% patients to moderate status, and 41.43% to severe status. In relation to Hemophilia B, we account 48 (14.5%) patients; 5.2% corresponds to mild status, 23.68% moderate status and 52.63% severe status. The rest of the patients have other disorders of coagulation such as Von Willebrand disease and rare coagulation factor deficiency (V, VII, XI and XII). According to the age group distribution for this series, a mayor proportion of 44.68%of patients belong to the group between 16 to 35 years old. The group above 35 years accounts 30%.The age groups of 6 to 15 years old and the group of 1 to 5 year old account 16.48% and 8.51%, respectively. Finally, it is important to point out that 37.76% of our hemophiliac patients are in the group of moderate illness status and 44.14% in the group of severe illness status. All the patients receive treatment with plasma-derived coagulation factor concentrates and in some cases recombinant therapy. Children receive prophylactic treatment.
