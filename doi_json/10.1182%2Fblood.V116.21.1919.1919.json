    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1919 Aberrant activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is implicated in driving the formation of various human cancers. Recent studies indicate that the Wnt pathway plays at least two distinct roles in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM): i) Aberrant, presumably autocrine, activation of canonical Wnt signaling in MM cells promotes tumor proliferation and metastasis; ii) Overexpression of the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf1 (DKK1), contributes to osteolytic bone disease by inhibiting osteoblast differentiation. Since DKK1 itself is a target of TCF/\u03b2-catenin mediated transcription, these findings suggests the presence of a negative feedback loop in MM, in which DKK1 acts as a potential tumor suppressor. In line with this hypothesis, we show here that DKK1 expression is lost in most MM cell lines and in a subset of patients with advanced MM. This loss is correlated with activation of the Wnt pathway, as demonstrated by increased nuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin. Analysis of the DKK1 promoter revealed CpG island methylation in several MM cell lines as well as in MM cells from patients with advanced MM. Moreover, demethylation of the DKK1 promoter restores DKK1 expression, which results in inhibition of \u03b2-catenin/TCF-mediated gene transcription in MM lines. Taken together, our data identify aberrant methylation of the DKK1 promoter as a cause of DKK1 silencing in advanced stage MM, which may play an important role in the progression of MM by unleashing Wnt signaling.
