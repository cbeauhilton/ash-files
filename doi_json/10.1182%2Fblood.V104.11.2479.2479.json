    "abstract_text": "As with other B-cell malignancies, chromosomal translocations to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) locus on chromosome 14q32 are believed to be a hallmark of multiple myeloma (MM), occurring in approximately 50% of patients. Identification of these chromosomal translocations has resulted in the discovery of powerful prognostic tools and novel molecular targets that promise to revolutionize the treatment of this malignancy. Five recurrent translocation partners have been defined, resulting in the dysregulation of the genes encoding cyclin D1 and D3, c-maf, mafB and Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) together with MMSET. Genetic analysis of 14q32 translocations in MM has identified distinct groups of patients with separate clinical outcomes supporting a biological correlation of these genes in MM. In particular, the t(4;14) translocation portends a particularly bad prognosis. The association of FGFR3 expression with t(4;14) myeloma and the demonstration of the transforming potential of this receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), make this a particularly attractive target for drug development for this poor prognosis group. We report here the development of a novel and highly specific anti-FGFR3 neutralizing antibody (PRO-001) isolated from a phage display human combinatorial antibody library. PRO-001 binds with high affinity (Kd=1.3 nM) to FGFR3 in in vitro binding assays and blocks ligand-dependent and independent FGFR3 phosphorylation and signal transduction in cell-based assays. Furthermore, PRO-001 potently inhibits FGFR3-dependent solid tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. We found that PRO-001 bound to, and competed with FGF binding to the surface of FGFR3 on human myeloma cell lines. PRO-001 inhibited FGF-induced phosphorylation of wild-type FGFR3 and downstream ERK phosphorylation in stable B9 cell transfectants (B9-WT) and FGFR3 expressing human myeloma cell lines. The antibody inhibited FGF-mediated growth of B9-WT with an IC50 of 3 \u03bcg/ml as determined by MTT proliferation assay. Growth of these cells could be rescued by IL-6 demonstrating selectivity of PRO-001 for FGFR3. PRO-001 inhibited the viability of the FGFR3 expressing, human myeloma cell line, UTMC2. Inhibition of viability was still observed when cells were co-cultured with stroma or in the presence of IL-6, a potent growth factor for MM cells. Several myeloma cell lines lacking FGFR3, showed minimal growth inhibition demonstrating selectivity and lack of non-specific toxic at effective dose concentrations. Finally, PRO-001 bound to FGFR3 on the cell surface, inhibited ERK phosphorylation, and induced cytotoxic responses in primary MM samples derived from t(4;14) positive patients. A xenograft mouse model has been established and studies assessing in vivo activity of PRO-001 are planned and will be reported. Taken together, the data demonstrate that PRO-001 is a specific and potent inhibitor of FGFR3 and that it deserves further study for targeted therapy in MM.",
