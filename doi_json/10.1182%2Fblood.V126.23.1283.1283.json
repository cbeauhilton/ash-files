    "abstract_text": "Dysregulation of apoptotic pathways provides an indiscriminate mechanism for refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to escape cell death induced by many chemotherapeutic compounds. Here we have assessed the potential of SMAC mimetic (SM) compounds to short circuit cell death resistance by blocking the pro-survival cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP) proteins. By screening a large set of patient-derived precursor B-cell ALL samples in an ex vivo model of the leukemia microenvironment we detect exquisite sensitivity to two different SM compounds, Birinapant and LCL161, in about one third of ALL samples. Strong e x vivo SM activity correlated with potent in vivo anti-leukemic efficacy against de novo refractory and relapsed ALL xenografts. Intriguingly, we find that although SM-sensitivity is independent of TNF and TNFR1 levels, expression of TNFR2 is highly predictive of response to SM in two separate cohorts of ALL samples, suggesting that TNFR2 expression may represent a promising biomarker for identifying SM-sensitive cells. Downstream, we employ a novel and powerful multi-colour Lenti-CRISPR approach to show that simultaneous disruption of both apoptotic and necroptotic genes is necessary to block SM-induced death. In contrast, disruption of RIP1 alone was adequate to block SM-induced apoptosis and necroptosis. Surprisingly, RIP1 loss had no significant impact on response to standard anti-leukemic therapies, supporting a view that the RIP1-dependent death pathway is not likely to be selected against in leukemia cells that have failed to respond to front line therapy. These results provide the first evidence that SM compounds can circumvent apoptotic escape in drug-refractory ALL through parallel activation of both RIP1-dependent apoptosis and necroptosis. Furthermore, our data strongly support further development of SM as anti-leukemic agents for treatment in resistant disease. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
