    "abstract_text": "Background: AML is a heterogeneous disease with various chromosomal aberrations. The karyotype at diagnosis provides important prognostic information that influences therapy and outcome, and patients (pts) with complex karyotype (CK) have generally a poor outcome. TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human tumors. The reported TP53 mutation rate in AML is low (2.1%). In contrast, the incidence of TP53 mutations in AML with a complex aberrant karyotype is higher (69-78%). Aims: To investigate the frequency, the types of mutations, the associated cytogenetic abnormalities and the prognostic role of TP53 mutations in adult AML pts, we focused the screening on subgroups of AML with chromosome abnormalities. Patients and Methods : 886 AML patients were analysed at the Ser\u00e0gnoli Institute of Bologna between 2002 and 2013 for morphology, immunophenotype, cytogenetic and for a panel of genetic alterations ( FLT3, NPM, WT1, CBF fusion transcripts, DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, etc). Of these, 172 adult AML pts were also examined for TP53 mutations using several methods, including Sanger sequencing, Next-Generation deep-Sequencing (Roche) and HiSeq 2000 (Illumina) platform (35/172 pts). 40 samples were genotyped with Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 arrays or with CytoScan HD Array (Affymetrix) and analysed by Nexus Copy Number\u2122 v7.5 (BioDiscovery). Results: Of the 886 AML patients beforehand analysed, 172 pts were screened for TP53 mutations and were correlated with cytogenetic analysis (excluding 15 pts where the karyotype was not available). 1. Fifty-two pts (30,2%) have 3 or more chromosome abnormalities, i.e. complex karyotype; 2. 71 (41,3%) presented one or two cytogenetic abnormalities (other-AML) and 3. 34 pts (19,8%) have normal karyotype. Sanger sequencing analysis detected TP53 mutations on 29 patients with 36 different types of mutations; seven pts (4%) have 2 mutations. Mostly (23/29) of the TP53 mutated pts (79.3%) had complex karyotype while only 6/29 mutated pts have \u201cno CK\u201d (21% and 3% of the entire screened population). Overall, between pts with complex karyotype, TP53 frequency is 44.2%. Regarding the types of the TP53 alterations, 32 were deleterious point mutations (http://p53.iarc.fr/TP53GeneVariations.aspx) and 4 deletions. Forty pts were also analysed for Copy Number Alterations (CNAs) by Affymetrix SNP arrays: several CNAs were found ranged from loss or gain of complete chromosome (chr) arms to focal deletions and gains targeting one or few genes involving macroscopic (>1.5 Mbps), submicroscopic genomic intervals (50 Kbps - 1.5 Mbps) and LOH (>5 Mbps) events. Of relevance, gains located on chr 8 were statistically associated with TP53 mutations (p = 0.001). Seven genes are included in these regions ( RGS20, TCEA1, LINC01299, ARMC1, MTFR1, RAD54B, KIAA1429 ). In addition to the trisomy of the chr 8, others CNAs, located on other chromosomes are significantly associated (p = 0.05) with TP53 mutations: loss of chr 5q, chr 3 (p22.3), chr 12 (p12.3) and the gain of chr 17 (p11.2), chr 16 (p11.2-11.3) and chr 14 (q32.33). The zinc finger gene ZNF705B, implicated in the regulation of transcription was the most differentially associated gene (gain). WES analysis was done in 37 pts, 32 TP53 were wt while 5 pts were TP53 mutated: of importance, CDC27, PLIN4 and MUC4 were found also mutated in 3 out of 5 TP53 mutated (60%) . Clinical outcome: as previously reported, alterations of TP53 were significantly associated with poor outcome in terms of both overall survival and disease free-survival (P < 0.0001). Conclusions : Our data demonstrated that TP53 mutations occur in 16.86% of AML with a higher frequency in the subgroup of complex karyotype AML (p< 0.0001\u2013Fischer\u2019s exact test). Since TP53 mutations have predicted to be deleterious and significantly correlated with prognosis, TP53 mutation screening should be recommended at least in complex karyotype AML pts. Furthermore, although further studies in larger numbers of patients are needed, the gain of chromosome 8 was observed to be significantly associated to TP53 mutations pts.
