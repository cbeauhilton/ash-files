    "abstract_text": "Background: BR101801 not only blocks the signaling responsible for cell growth caused by PI3K, but also efficiently induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through inhibition of DNA-PK activation and stimulates decreasing stability of the oncogenic protein, c-Myc(AACR2020 abstract #655). This phase I study evaluated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary activity of the BR101801 (PI3K\u03b3/\u03b4 and DNA PK inhibitor) in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. Method: This is a Phase I, multi-center, open-label, first-in-human study. The Phase Ia (dose escalation) part of the study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of BR101801. BR101801 was administered orally once daily in 28-day cycles. The dose escalation part was initiated with a dose titration in the initial cohort, followed by a 3 + 3 design. Results: 11 patients were enrolled and have been treated at 4 dose levels: 50mg, 100mg, 200mg, 325mg and expanded 200mg through fifth cohort escalation. Pathological subtypes include 7 PTCL, 2 DLBCL, 1 MZBL and 1 composite CTCL/MF. 3 females and 8 males have been treated to date. Median age is 58 (range 30-71) and ECOG PS is in the range of 0-1. All patients had taken at least one prior chemotherapy. 10 of total patients have completed at least one cycle except 1 premature drop-out case due to disease progression. First interim analysis after completion of cycle 3 of the last patient of 200mg QD cohort had been conducted, which was to include 5 patients (1 DLBCL and 4 PTCLs). No DLT had been identified in Cohorts 1-3, and 2 patients discontinued the study treatment due to adverse event (G4 thrombocytopenia, not related to IP) and disease progression, respectively. The PK values from multiple dosing range of 50mg to 200mg cohort resulted in an approximate 2.92-fold and 4.97 fold increase in exposure based on Cmax and AUCtau, respectively. BR101801 PK profile showed that the exposure of concentration increased in a dose dependent manner and there was no accumulation observed in the dose range of 50mg to 200mg. 2 DLTs was observed at 325mg QD cohort. The dose was de-escalated to the previous lower dose level (200mg QD) and was expanded to 3 additional patients. The expansion cohort is ongoing at present. 2 of 11 patients had G3 skin reaction and 3 had G3 hepatotoxicites. All adverse effects were manageable and recovered to grade 0-1 upon BR1010801 discontinuation. Total 5 patients have been currently ongoing. For overall tumor response assessment, 4 SDs and 2 PRs have been obsereved. Summary/Conclusion: 200 mg QD of BR101801 was shown to provide target exposure for clinical efficacy with the tolerable and safe profiles. BR101801 was well tolerated and showed preliminary signs of activity in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies. The phase Ib/II study of BR101801 is warranted in relapsed/refractory NHL. This study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT04018248.
