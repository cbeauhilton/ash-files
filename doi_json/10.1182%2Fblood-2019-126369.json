    "abstract_text": "Background: Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) is an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy approved for the treatment of adult patients who have relapsed/refractory large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) and have had \u2265 2 prior systemic therapies. In ZUMA-1, the registrational study of axi-cel in patients with refractory LBCL, the objective response rate was 83% (complete response rate, 58%), with ongoing responses in 39% after a median follow-up of 27.1 months (Locke FL, et al. Lancet Oncol. 2019). Despite the success of axi-cel, approximately 60% of patients have no response or relapse after treatment, indicating that additional strategies are needed for patients with relapsed/refractory LBCL. Preclinical murine studies have shown that rituximab augmented the tumor-suppressing effects of anti-CD19 CAR T cells, and the combination led to higher rates of tumor reduction (Mihara K, et al. Br J Haematol. 2010; Rufener GA, et al. Cancer Immunol Res. 2016). The IMiD\u00ae immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide has shown activity in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma and has also been shown to enhance the antitumor functions of anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 CAR T cells in mice (Otahal P, et al. Oncoimmunology. 2016). In ZUMA-14, the aim is to investigate the efficacy and safety of axi-cel in combination with rituximab or lenalidomide in adult patients with refractory LBCL. Methods: This Phase 2 study (NCT04002401) has a planned enrollment of approximately 60 patients aged \u2265 18 years with refractory LBCL, defined as a response of either progressive disease or stable disease to previous chemotherapy or progressive disease or relapse \u2264 12 months after an autologous stem cell transplant. Patients with prior IMiD\u00ae treatment, including lenalidomide, prior CAR T cell therapy, and/or prior CD19-targeted therapy are excluded. After leukapheresis, patients will be assigned 1:1 to receive axi-cel with either rituximab (Cohort 1) or lenalidomide (Cohort 2). Patients will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy of fludarabine (30 mg/m 2 ) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m 2 ) on days -5 to -3 before axi-cel infusion (2 \u00d7 10 6 cells/kg) on Day 0. Cohort 1 will receive rituximab (375 mg/m 2 ) every 28 days starting on Day -5 for a total of 6 doses. Cohort 2 will receive lenalidomide (10 mg) daily starting 7 days after leukapheresis through Day 3 and for 5 additional cycles (20 mg, first 21 days of each 28-day cycle) beginning after axi-cel infusion starting on Day 21. Patients may not receive any therapy other than conditioning therapy and rituximab or lenalidomide, as specified by cohort, between leukapheresis and axi-cel infusion. The primary endpoint is investigator-assessed complete response rate per the Lugano classification (Cheson BD, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2014). Key secondary endpoints include safety, objective response rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and pharmacokinetics (levels of blood CAR T cells over time). Exploratory endpoints for both cohorts include pharmacodynamic assessment of cytokine profiles and the rate of CD19-negative relapses. An additional exploratory endpoint for Cohort 2 is to investigate immunomodulation of the tumor microenvironment, including the number and activation of T cells and natural killer cells. Enrollment is expected to start in September 2019.
