    "abstract_text": "Background: An inflammatory bone marrow microenvironment with unchecked immune activation mediated by cytotoxic T cells and defective T regulatory cells contribute to acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes, including aplastic anemia (AA), myelofibrosis (MF) and hypoplastic myelodysplasia (MDS). Adoptive therapy with allogeneic cord blood (CB) T-regulatory (Treg) cells has shown safety in humans and clinical benefit in graft vs. host disease. Derived from CB, these Treg cells enjoy immune privilege, demonstrate high proliferative index, lack plasticity, and have been shown to consistently suppress inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesized that adoptive therapy with CB Tregs can be utilized as treatment for the inflammatory BMF disorders. Study Design and Methods: This is a phase I clinical trial examining the role of a single infusion of CK0801, an allogeneic, fresh CB Treg product for the treatment of BMF. CK0801 was produced utilizing novel process development that consists of well-defined qualification criteria for the starting material (CB units), parameters for manufacturing and culture-expansion; and well-defined analytic testing and lot release criteria. Three dose-levels were examined: i) 1x10 6 cells/kg; ii) 3x10 6 cells/kg and iii) 10x10 6 cells/kg (NCT03773393). No immune suppression or lymphodepletion was administered. Patients were allowed to continue their ongoing treatment at stable doses. The study followed a 3+3 phase dose-escalation design. Patients aged \u2265 18 yrs with AA, MDS or MF, and available (HLA 3 out of 6) matched CB units were eligible. The primary endpoint is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of the Treg infusion defined as any of the following 3 events: i) severe (grade 3 or 4) infusion toxicity within 24 hours (NCI-CTCAE V4.0), ii) regimen related death within 30 days, or iii) severe (grade 3 or 4) cytokine release syndrome (CRS) within 30 days. Secondary endpoints include exploration of efficacy, PB and BM immune reconstitution, and inflammatory cytokines. Results: Nine patients (Pts) have been treated, with a median age of 57 (range, 20-74) with a diagnosis of MF (n=4); AA (N=4) and hypoplastic MDS (n=1). Overall, the patients had received a median of 4 prior therapies (range, 1-5). There were no infusion related reactions and no DLTs in any of the patients. The patient characteristics and day 30 response are summarized in Table 1. The median time to best response was 3 months (range, 1-6) with complete response (n=1); partial response (n=2); symptom response (n=2); anemia response (n=1); stable disease (n=2) and no response (n=1) (Figure 1). The median duration of response was 6 months (range, 1-12). Of the 5 transfusion dependent pts, transfusion independence was reported in 3 pts (AA = 2; MF= 1). Improvement in transfusion requirement was seen in 2 pts (AA=1; hypoplastic MDS = 1). All AA pts continued their immunosuppressive therapies and the 2 MF patients continued their Ruxolitinib. Decrease in inflammatory biomarker levels as well as lower Th17 cells were observed post CK0801 infusion. No impact on the anti-viral activity of the normal CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was observed (data will be presented later). Conclusion: A single infusion of allogeneic CB derived Treg cells (CK0801) is well tolerated, feasible, and may be associated with clinical improvement in patients with immune related bone marrow disorders. Clinical response appears to correlate with a decrease in inflammatory biomarkers. Expansion of the study, including multiple repeated Treg dosing in BMF is planned.
