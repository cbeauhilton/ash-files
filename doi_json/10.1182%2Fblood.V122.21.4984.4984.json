    "abstract_text": "Background Detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a strong predictor of outcome. In addition, MRD testing prior to stem cell transplant for ALL can inform on the risk of relapse. The ClonoSIGHT test uses deep sequencing of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptors to identify and monitor MRD. In retrospective cohorts, we have previously shown this technology is highly correlated with flow cytometry and PCR-based MRD methods, but has even greater sensitivity than both technologies (Faham et al, Blood 2012; Gawad et al, Blood 2012). \u00a0Here we report on four clinical cases where we used the ClonoSIGHT assay to prospectively monitor MRD, in both the medullary and extramedullary compartments, to demonstrate the feasibility of this technology for MRD monitoring of children with relapsed ALL. Methods Universal primer sets were used to amplify rearranged variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments from the immunoglobulin heavy and kappa chain (IGH and IGK), as well as T-cell receptor beta, delta and gamma.\u00a0 The assay was performed on genomic DNA isolated from cells from the bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid, or testes.\u00a0 The test was first done at the time of relapse to identify the malignant clonotype, which was monitored at subsequent time points. The patients were ineligible for clinical trials and concurrently underwent MRD testing using flow cytometry. The sequencing assays were performed to show feasibility of the approach. Results Patient one was a 14 y/o ALL relapse patient who was not in morphologic remission after standard re-induction therapy. The malignant clonotype was identified on a bone marrow aspirate from relapse; follow-up MRD tests were done using both flow cytometry and deep sequencing five times throughout salvage therapy with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and high dose cytarabine over 75 days; the last two MRD data points showed 0.6% and 6% by ClonoSIGHT MRD and 0.4% and 1.3% by flow cytometry MRD. Morphologic remission with count recovery was used as the criteria to direct this patient to SCT. Patient two was a 9 y/o with ALL, for whom MRD was used to test for relapsed disease in multiple tissues.\u00a0 This patient experienced three isolated testicular relapses (M1 marrow and no CNS involvement) at the time of each relapse. The ClonoSIGHT assay was used on tissue from a testicular biopsy to identify the malignant clone(s).\u00a0 Testing of the bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid did not detect the malignant clones in those sites. This patient underwent therapeutic orchiectomy and 4-week systemic re-induction resulting in a fourth complete remission and now is under evaluation for consolidation therapy with a SCT. A third patient was an 8 y/o with a combined bone marrow and testicular ALL relapse, who was in morphologic remission in the marrow after re-induction therapy and testicular radiotherapy. Prior to undergoing SCT the patient had negative MRD by flow cytometry but had 0.008% MRD using the ClonoSIGHT MRD assay. \u00a0The fourth patient was a 15-yo with ALL relapse at 9 years from first remission, treated with a four-drug re-induction and Berlin-Frankfurt-M\u00fcnster based consolidation and maintenance therapy.\u00a0 This patient was MRD negative by both flow cytometry and ClonoSIGHT MRD at end of re-induction as well as end of consolidation and remains in remission. Conclusions We have shown the feasibility of using sequencing-based tests for monitoring MRD in children with relapsed ALL in medullary (bone marrow) and extramedullary compartments (testes and CSF).\u00a0 Further studies are needed to establish the prognostic value of MRD detected by the ClonoSIGHT assay in both medullary and extramedullary sites that are below the limit of detection of PCR and flow cytometry. These sequencing-based tests may provide a useful tool to develop risk stratification schemas for drug development in relapsed childhood ALL.
