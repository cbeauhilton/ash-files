    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2914 Background: Myeloma (MM) - stromal cell-cell interactions play a crucial role in MM cell growth, survival, and drug resistance. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is up-regulated in different cancers, including MM, and represents one of the major adhesion molecules mediating tumor-stromal cell-cell contacts. Previous investigations have shown that ICAM antibodies induce antitumor activity in SCID mice xenografted with MM cell lines, likely involving Fc :Fc gamma receptor dependent anti-tumor mechanisms. We have examined the anti-MM activity in the SCID-hu mouse model of a specific humanized ICAM1 antibody (BI-505, Bio-Invent, Sweden) using primary MM cells. Materials and Methods: The expression of ICAM1 was examined in plasma cells from 22 donors, 351 newly diagnosed MMs, and 9 MM cell lines using Affymetrix U133 Plus2 chips. Human fetal femurs and tibias, obtained at 17 to 22 gestational weeks, were cut into fragments and implanted subcutaneously in 16 SCID mice (SCID-hu) at age 6 to 8 weeks. Four weeks after bone implantation, approximately 5 \u00d710 6 CD138+ plasma cells from MM patients were injected directly into the human bone of the SCID-hu mice in final volume of 30 to 40\u03bcl of phosphate-buffered saline(PBS). Human immunoglobin (hIg) levels by ELISA were used as an indicator of myeloma cell growth. When hIg level reached 10\u03bcg/mL or higher in 2 consecutive samples after 4 weeks of injection of the tumor cells, the mice were divided into four groups (n=4), Control group (not injected MM cells and no drug treatment); the other 3 groups were injected with MM cells: the isotype control group (isotype IgG 2mg/kg, i.p., twice weekly), BI-505 group (2mg/kg, i.p., twice weekly) and bortezomib group (1mg/kg, i.p., twice weekly). Bone remolding was detected by X-radiography and by measuring bone mineral density (BMD). Tumor cells were detected by immunohistochemistry using the CD138 antibody. Results: High expression of ICAM1 was observed in normal plasma cells, primary MM cells and MM cell lines. With a follow- up of 10 weeks, the tumor burden in the mice treated with BI-505 or bortezomib was significantly lower compared with the isotype control group ( p: BI505 < 0.01; p : bortezomib < 0.01). Also, the number of MM tumor cells stained with the CD138 antibody was significantly less in samples treated with either BI-505 or bortezomib than in the isotype control group ( p < 0.01). In addition, 6 weeks after injection of tumor cells, X-rays showed severe bone resorption in the isotype-control group, while there was no obvious bone resorption in the fetal bones after treatment with BI-505 or bortezomib. The BMD (0.0715\u00b10.006 g/cm 2 ) of isotype control was significantly lower than that in other 3 groups including control: 0.1278\u00b1g/cm 2 , BI-505 group: 0.102\u00b10.0064 g/cm 2 , and bortezomib group: 0.106\u00b10.0059g/cm 2 . Importantly, the number of TRAP-positive cells was significantly higher in the isotype control group than in the other 3 groups ( p < 0.01). Conclusion: ICAM1 expression presents in all subtypes of myeloma. The ICAM1 antibody BI-505 significantly inhibits primary MM cell growth and bone destruction in the SCID-hu mice to the same degree as bortezomib, indicating its clinical applicability in therapy of MM.
