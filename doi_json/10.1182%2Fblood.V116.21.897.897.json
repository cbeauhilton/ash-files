    "abstract_text": "Abstract 897 Recent changes in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) including increased use of reduced-intensity conditioning, peripheral blood cells as the graft source (PB) and unrelated donors (URD) warrant re-evaluation of risk factors for acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and its impact on overall survival (OS). Risk factors for these outcomes were analyzed using more recent data from CIBMTR observational database. Methods: The cohort included adult patients \u2265 20 y transplanted from an HLA-identical sibling (SD) (n=3191) or URD (N=2370) for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), or myelodsyplastic syndrome (MDS) using a T-cell replete graft from 1999\u20132005. Six groups were created to evaluate the impact of conditioning [(myeloablative (MA) and reduced-intensity or non-myeloablative (RIC)], total-body irradiation (TBI) and graft source [(bone marrow (BM) or PB] as follows: MA+TBI+PB (group 1), MA+TBI+BM (group 2) MA+ no TBI+PB (group 3), MA+ no-TBI+BM (group 4), RIC+PB (group 5) and RIC+BM (group 6). Separate analyses were performed for SD and URD. IBMTR grade was used to classify aGVHD. A p-value of \u2264 0.01 was considered significant. Results: Among the SD cohort, the probability of aGVHD grade B-D and grade C-D at 100 days was 39% (95% CI, 37\u201341%) and 16% (95% CI, 14\u201317%). In multivariate analyses, non-TBI based MA regimens with a BM graft (group 4), RIC conditioning with PB (group 5) and tacrolimus plus methotrexate aGVHD prophylaxis were associated with lower odds ratio of grade B-D aGVHD ( Table 1 ). The probability of OS was 51% (95% CI: 49\u201353%) at 3 y and 46% (95% CI: 44\u201349%) at 5 y. In multivariate analyses, grade B-D aGVHD was associated with a higher risk of death. Other independent risk factors for OS are shown in Table 2 . Among the URD cohort, the probability of aGVHD grade B-D and C-D at 100 days was 59% (95%, CI 57\u201361%) and 32% (30-34%). In multivariate analysis, BM with MA (TBI and no TBI) or RIC conditioning (groups 2, 4 and 6) were significantly associated with lower odds ratio of grade B-D aGVHD ( Table 1 ). Other independent risk factors included a diagnosis of CML. HCT from a 7/8 HLA-mismatched URD showed a trend for higher incidence of aGVHD (p=0.02). The probability of OS was 38% (95% CI: 35\u201340%) at 3 y and 33% (95% CI: 31\u201335%) at 5 y. In multivariate analysis, grade B-D aGVHD was associated with a higher mortality. Table 2 shows other independent risk factors for OS. Conclusion: Intensity of the conditioning regimen, TBI and the graft source has a combined effect on the risk of aGVHD. In both SD and URD cohorts, BM with MA, non-TBI regimens were associated with lower risk of aGVHD. In URD cohort, BM after a RIC also was associated with a reduced risk of aGVHD. Modulation of these risk factors is needed to reduce acute GVHD incidence and death after allogeneic transplantation. Table 1: Risk Factors for grade B-D aGVHD  . SD . URD . Variable . N .
