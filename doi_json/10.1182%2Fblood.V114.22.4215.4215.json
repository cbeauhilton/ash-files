    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4215 Introduction Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a disease of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) resulting in a clone of hematopoietic cells deficient in glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol anchored proteins. The clinical spectrum of PNH is highly variable with classical hemolytic PNH at one end, and PNH in association with aplastic anemia (AA/PNH) or other bone marrow failure states at the other end. It is still largely unknown what is causing these highly variable clinical presentations. Immune-mediated marrow failure has been suggested to contribute to the development of a PNH clone by selective damage to normal HSC. However, in classic PNH patients with no or only mild cytopenias, a role for immune mediated marrow failure is less obvious. No series of trephine biopsies has been previously documented of patients with PNH and AA/PNH to investigate the similarities and differences in these patients. Methods We have reviewed a series of trephine biopsies of 41 PNH patients at the time the PNH clone was first detected. The histology was compared of 27 patients with aplastic anemia and a PNH clone was compared to that of 14 patients with classic PNH. Age related cellularity, the ratio between myeloid and erythroid cells (ME ratio), and the presence of inflammatory cells (mast cells, lymphoid nodules and plasma cells) were evaluated. The relation with clinical and other laboratory parameters of PNH was established. Results Classic PNH patients showed a normal or hypercellular marrow in 79% of patients, whereas all AA/PNH patients showed a hypocellular marrow. Interestingly, a decreased myelopoiesis was observed not only in AA/PNH patients but also in 93% of classic PNH patients, despite normal absolute neutrophil counts (ANC \u2265 1,5 \u00d7 10 9 /l) in 79% of these patients. The number of megakaryocytes was decreased in 29% of classic PNH patients although thrombocytopenia (< 150 \u00d7 10 9 /l) was only present in 14% of the patients. Median PNH granulocyte clone size was 70% (range 8-95%) in classic PNH patients, whereas in AA/PNH patients this was only 10% (range 0.5-90%). PNH clones below 5% were exclusively detected in the AA/PNH group. Clinical or laboratory evidence of hemolysis was present in all classical PNH patients and in 52% of AA/PNH patients and correlated with PNH granulocyte clone size. Bone marrow iron stores were decreased in 71% of classic PNH patients. In contrast, increased iron stores were present in 63% of AA/PNH patients, probably reflecting their transfusion history. AA/PNH patients showed increased plasma cells in 15% of patients and lymphoid nodules in 37%, versus 0% and 11% in classic PNH. Increased mast cells (>2/high power field) were three times more frequent in AA/PNH (67%) than in PNH (21%). Conclusion Classic PNH patients were characterized by a more cellular bone marrow, increased erythropoiesis, larger PNH clones and clinically by less pronounced or absent peripheral cytopenias and more overt hemolysis. Decreased myelopoiesis and/or megakaryopoiesis was observed in both AA/PNH and classic PNH patients, even in the presence of normal peripheral blood counts, suggesting a role for bone marrow failure in classic PNH as well. More prominent inflammatory infiltrates were observed in AA/PNH patients compared to classical PNH patients. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
