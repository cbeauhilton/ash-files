    "abstract_text": "Background: Amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis is caused by the deposition of misfolded light chain (LC) proteins, which may cause organ failure and death. Current treatments, which target the plasma cells that produce LC, induce organ responses in only 30% to 40% of patients. There is a substantial need for a safe and effective amyloid-directed therapy to improve recovery of organ function. NEOD001, a monoclonal antibody that targets misfolded LC, is hypothesized to neutralize circulating LC aggregates and to clear insoluble organ deposits. In an ongoing phase 1/2 study (NCT02613182; Gertz M et al. J Clin Oncol . 2016;34(10):1097-1103) in 27 patients with AL amyloidosis and persistent organ dysfunction, monthly NEOD001 infusions were well tolerated and produced no infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions. In a best response analysis of subjects who fulfilled eligibility criteria at baseline, 57% met cardiac and 60% met renal response criteria. Supported by these positive results, the current study (VITAL; NCT02312206) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of NEOD001 in patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis. Here we present the study design for this trial in progress. Patients and Methods: Eligible patients (estimated enrollment, 236) with a diagnosis of AL amyloidosis (newly diagnosed, treatment naive) and cardiac dysfunction (N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP] \u2265650 and 12 mm, or cardiac biopsy-detected amyloidosis) and with estimated glomerular filtration rate \u226530 mL/min/1.73 m 2 will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive NEOD001 (24 mg/kg q28d) plus standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy or placebo plus SOC therapy. Subjects will be stratified according to Mayo Clinic stage, renal stage, and 6-minute walk test (6MWT) distance. The primary end point is a composite, evidence-based measure consisting of all-cause mortality or cardiac hospitalization. Key secondary end points include cardiac response measured by NT-proBNP (as defined by Comenzo RL et al. Leukemia . 2012;26(11):2317-2325) and change in 6MWT distance, Short Form-36 Health Survey response, Neuropathy Impairment Score-Lower Limb and renal response (as defined by Palladini G et al. Blood . 2014;124(15):2325-2332).
