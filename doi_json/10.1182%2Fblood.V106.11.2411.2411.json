    "abstract_text": "[Background]: MCL is an aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with a median survival of 3-4 years. New agents with mechanisms of action different than standard chemotherapy are needed to improve the outcome of MCL. Recent studies have documented single agent activity of bortezomib and rituximab in MCL. Analogs of rapamycin (temsirolimus) have also shown single agent activity in MCL (J Clin Oncol, June 27, 2005 epub). In order to provide rationale for a clinical trial combining rapamycin analogs with bortezomib or rituximab, we performed in vitro studies of the effect of combinations of these drugs on human MCL cell lines. [Methods]: Two human lymphoma cell lines - Granta 519 and M0258 - were incubated with various concentrations of rapamycin, bortezomib, and rituximab to determine the LD50 of each drug alone. For the experiments with rituximab a secondary goat anti-human (GAH) IgG Fc antibody was used to crosslink cell bound rituximab and induce cell killing. Percent viability was assessed after 48 hours using annexin/propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Tests for drug synergy used combinations of rapamycin and bortezomib and the Granta 519 cell line. Fixed ratios of the two drugs were tested and the results were evaluated for synergism (combination index <1 in median effect analysis) in inducing cell death. The drug concentrations used spanned the LD50 of each drug determined from the single-agent studies. In the studies combining rituximab with bortezomib or rapamycin, a single fixed dose of rituximab and GAH Fc was tested with various concentrations of the other drugs to detect additive anti-tumor effects. Studies were performed at least in triplicate. [Results]: All three drugs exhibited single-agent activity in vitro against the two cell lines. The LD50 for rapamycin ranged from 17.5 \u2013 25 micromolar for the Granta 519 cell line and 7.5\u201310 micromolar for M0258. The LD50 for bortezomib ranged from 2\u20135 ng/ml in both cell lines. Incubation of the cells with various concentrations of rituximab and GAH Fc had mild cytotoxic activity (reduced viability to 50\u201370% compared to GAH Fc control). This activity was not concentration dependent indicating saturation of CD20 by rituximab; therefore, a fixed concentration of rituximab was used for the combination experiments. When rituximab was added to bortezemib the % viability decreased by up to 37% (compared to bortezomib alone), and the bortezomib LD50 typically decreased to <1\u20132 ng/ml (LD50 was 2\u20135 ng/ml with bortezomib alone). The addition of rapamycin to rituximab increased the cytotoxicity by 23% compared to either drug alone and decreased the rapamycin LD50. When rapamycin and bortezomib were combined as treatment of Granta 519 cells, rapamycin was synergistic with bortezomib with a combination index <1. Sequencing the rapamycin either before or after the bortezomib treatment did not effect synergy in either direction. [Conclusion]: In vitro, rapamycin synergizes with bortezomib to enhance its cytotoxicity in MCL lines. Rituximab enhances the cytotoxicity of both of rapamycin and bortezomib. These in vitro studies provide the rationale to test combinations of these active agents in patients with MCL.",
