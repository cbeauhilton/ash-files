    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2257 Background: Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT) is an effective anti-tumor strategy in multiple myeloma (MM) and lymphoma patients. However, a significant proportion of patients cannot mobilize a sufficient number of CD34+cells to proceed to transplantation. Plerixafor addition to G-CSF significantly increases the proportion of lymphoma and MM patients, mobilizing \u22652\u00d71010 6 /kg CD 34+ cells, considered the minimum dose safe for ASCT; however there are very few data about the use of Plerixafor after mobilizing chemotherapy (CHT). Patients and Methods: We report here 39 MM or lymphoma patients, candidate for ASCT, who received Plerixafor to collect peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) after CHT, followed by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF); 17 were affected by non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, 16 by MM and 6 by Hodgkin's Lymphoma; 21 were male and 18 female and the median age was 58 years (20-72). In this population the PBSC collection was planned after disease-specific chemotherapy, followed by G-CSF. These patients were considered poor mobilizers (PM), and therefore eligible for Plerixafor addition, according to the following criteria: i\u0300-previous failure of at least one mobilization attempt (proved PM); i\u0300i\u0300- presence of factors predicting unsuccessful harvest (predicted PM), such as: advanced disease, extensive Bone Marrow involvement, previous treatment with extensive radiotherapy or previous prolonged treatment with stem cell poisons (Fludarabine, Alkylating agents, Lenalidomide); i\u0300i\u0300i\u0300- CD34 + cells count <10 cells/\u03bcL in Peripheral Blood (PB), during the recovery phase after CHT plus G-CSF for at least 7 consecutive days (probable PM). All patients had advanced disease and the median number of previous CHT regimens was 2 (range:1-4); 24 failed at least one mobilization attempt (proven PM); 5 had been considered predicted PM, according to disease status and/or previous treatment; 10 patients have been considered \u201cprobable PM\u201d, due to the persistently low CD34+ cell count after G-CSF for at least 7 consecutive days. Retrospectively only 10 out of the 39 mobilized patients reached a CD34+ cell count \u226510/mcl in PB, before receiving Plerixafor. Plerixafor (0.24 mg/Kg), was administered subcutaneously for up to 3 consecutive days (median 2 days; range: 1\u20133), while continuing G-CSF, 9\u201311 hours before the planned leukapheresis. G-CSF was administered starting 48\u201396 hrs after the end of the mobilizing CHT. In all cases the mobilizing CHT was part of a disease-specific protocol: 13 patients received high-intermediate-dose Cytoxan (3-7 g/m2), 13 DHAP, 5 high-dose VP16 (2 g/m2), 4 HyperC-VAD and 4 other CHT (Dexa-BEAM, DCEP, IVAC, High-dose ARA-C). Results: Plerixafor administration was safe and no significant adverse events were recorded. Following Plerixafor we observed a 3,3 median fold-increase (range 0\u201320) of the circulating CD34 + cells, (median CD34+ peak: 31; range: 0\u2013202/mcl) as compared to the day before Plerixafor (median CD 34+ peak: 5; range 0\u201332/mcl). In 30/39 patients we collected \u22652\u00d710 6 CD34 + cells/Kg (median 3.7\u00d710 6 /kg; range 0\u201315) after 1\u20133 leukaphereses (median 2). Twenty-five patients have been transplanted with Plerixafor-mobilized PBSCs, 24 of them showing a rapid and durable hematological recovery. The median time to reach PMN recovery (PMN\u2265500/mcl) was 13 days (9-23); median days to reach unsupported Platelet count \u226520.000/mcl and \u226550.000/mcl were 15 (89-88) and 22 (15-180) respectively. At present 22 patients are alive and maintain stable engraftment after ASCT; 1 died before engraftment while 2 died of disease progression. Our results suggest that \u201con-demand\u201d addition of Plerixafor to G-CSF after disease-oriented-CHT is safe and may allow a satisfactory harvest in lymphoma and MM patients, considered to be proven or predicted PM, but still eligible for ASCT.
