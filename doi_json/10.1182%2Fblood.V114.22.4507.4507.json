    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4507 Adoptive immunotherapy with antigen-specific T cells can be effective in the treatment of melanoma, as well as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, to obtain sufficient antigen-specific T cells for treatment, T cells have to be cultured for several weeks in vitro, and in vitro expanding T cells is difficult to control. Alternatively, transfer of T cell receptors (TCR) with defined antigen specificity into recipient T cells may be simply generation of antigen-specific T cells. The TCR-transferred T cells have been demonstrated to be functionally active in mouse models. TCR gene transfer is shown as a safe strategy, but appears limited by an objective response rate of 12%. It is adversely affected by newly formed TCR\u03b1\u03b2 heterodimers comprising exogenous and endogenous TCR chains that dilute expression of transgenic TCR\u03b1\u03b2 and are potentially self-reactive or by reduced expression of CD3\u03b6 which has been found to be decreased in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells isolated from the tumor site or from the peripheral circulation of patients with cancer. Our previous study has identified the oligoclonal V\u03b221 with different oligoclonal V\u03b1 partner in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with CML.In the present study, full-length gene sequences of oligoclonal V\u03b221, V\u03b113 and V\u03b118 had been obtained from a case with CML using PCR, then the TCR genes were fused with whole human CD3\u03b6 chain gene respectively. Each of chimeric V\u03b118-CD3\u03b6 and V\u03b113-CD3\u03b6 pairing V\u03b221-CD3\u03b6 was cloned into PIRES plasmid respectivelyto construct two recombinant plasmids V\u03b113-CD3\u03b6-IRES-V\u03b221-CD3\u03b6 and V\u03b118-CD3\u03b6-IRES-V\u03b221-CD3\u03b6. Subsequently, their sequences were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestionanalysis and nucleotide sequencing. Each recombinant plasmids was transfected into K293 cells and Molt-4 cellsusing Lipofectamine TM 2000 or nucleofection respectively. The mRNA expression of TCR V\u03b118, V\u03b113, V\u03b221 and CD3\u03b6 chain genes in transfected cells were detected by RT-PCR and real-timePCR. The erpression of TCR V\u03b221 chain in transfected cells was confiomred by staining with FITC-conjugated anti-TCR V\u03b221.3 mAb using laser confocal microscopy(LCM) and flow cytometry (FCM) analysis. The expression of CD3\u03b6 chain in transfected K293 and Molt-4 cells were detected by western-blot using anti human CD3\u03b6 mAb. The results showed that two kindsof eukaryotic expression plasmids encoding chimeric TCR V\u03b113-CD3\u03b6/V\u03b221-CD3\u03b6 and V\u03b118-CD3\u03b6/V\u03b221-CD3\u03b6 specific for CMLwere constructed successfully and could express the relevant proteins well in vitro after transfecting both K293 cells and Molt-4cells. Farther studies will be performed to transfect the chimeric TCR V\u03b1-CD3\u03b6/V\u03b2-CD3\u03b6 plasmids in recipient T cells to detect the specific cytotoxicity. Chimeric TCR that encompasses whole human CD3\u03b6 may be a dual strategy that might enhance the efficacy and safety of TCR gene transfer and improve T cell immunodeficiency induced impaired expression of the CD3\u03b6 chain, farther study is required to confirm the suggestion.
