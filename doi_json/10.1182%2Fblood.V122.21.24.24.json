    "abstract_text": "Platelets release different types of secretory granules into their local environment, and this allows them to contribute to a variety of physiologic processes. These platelet granules include alpha granules, dense granules, and lysosomes, which all derive from the endosomal-lysosomal system. However, the mechanism of the biogenesis of each type of granule is not completely understood. Phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,5)P 2 ] is a membrane phosphoinositide that is essential for the regulation of membrane homeostasis, as well as for vesicle trafficking and cargo transport along the endolysosomal system in mammals. PtdIns(3,5)P 2 is synthesized on endosomes by the lipid kinase PIKfyve. Given the role of PIKfyve-mediated PtdIns(3,5)P 2 production in the endolysosomal pathway in other mammalian cells, we hypothesized that PtdIns(3,5)P 2 was an essential regulator for the biogenesis of granules within platelets. To analyze the contribution of PtdIns(3,5)P 2 to platelet granule biogenesis, we generated mice lacking PIKfyve kinase activity specifically in their platelets and in their megakaryocytes (PIKfyve flox/flox Pf4-Cre). We found that when compared with the control mice, PIKfyve flox/flox Pf4-Cre mice contained higher levels of the lysosomal enzyme, \u03b2-hexosaminidase, within their platelets and within their plasma. The PIKfyve-ablated platelets also released excessive \u03b2-hexosaminidase ex vivo upon stimulation with ADP, collagen or thrombin. However, the percentage of the total cellular \u03b2-hexosaminidase that was released from the PIKfyve-ablated platelets was comparable with that of control platelets. This suggests that the increased release of \u03b2-hexosaminidase from the PIKfyve-ablated platelets is due to the excessive storage of this enzyme within these platelets and not because of increased efficiency of lysosome secretion. In addition, we observed that PIKfyve-ablated platelets expressed increased amounts of Lysosomal Associated Membrane Protein 1 (LAMP-1), a marker of late endosomes and lysosomes. However, PIKfyve-ablated platelets expressed normal amounts of Early Endosome Antigen 1 (EEA-1), a marker of early endosomes. These results suggest that PIKfyve is critical for a component of platelet lysosome biology that occurs after the maturation of early endosomes. Together, these data demonstrate that PIKfyve is essential for the homeostasis of the endolysosomal system in platelets. Notably, the generation and secretion of the alpha granule components were intact in the PIKFyve-ablated platelets. This was shown by the normal expression of von Willebrand factor, platelet basic protein, and platelet factor 4. Likewise, secretion of ATP stored in the dense granules was similar between the PIKfyve flox/flox Pf4-Cre mice and their control littermates. Together, these results suggest that PIKfyve plays an essential regulatory role along the endolysosomal pathway in platelets, and the loss of PIKfyve in platelets can lead to an abnormality of lysosomal storage. Unexpectedly, we also found that the loss of PIKfyve exclusively within platelets triggers an inappropriate inflammatory response. This is shown by the massive tissue infiltration of aberrant vacuolated macrophages. In turn, this leads to multiple organ defects that impair development, body mass, and survival in mice. Moreover, mice lacking PIKfyve within their platelets developed accelerated arterial thrombosis in vivo, despite having normal platelet aggregation ex vivo. It is also remarkable that mice lacking PIKfyve in their platelets attenuated their organ defects when the secretion of their platelet lysosomes were inhibited in vivo . Collectively, our study demonstrates that PIKfyve is an essential regulator of platelet lysosome biogenesis. This study also highlights the previously unrecognized and important contributions of platelet lysosomal storage to inflammation, arterial thrombosis, and macrophage biology.
