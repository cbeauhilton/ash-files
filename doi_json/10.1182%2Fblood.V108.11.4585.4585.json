    "abstract_text": "Arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3 , arsenite) efficiently kills cells from various hematologic malignancies and has successfully been employed for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and multiple myeloma. Investigating the mechanisms of arsenic trioxide-induced cell death, we recently demonstrated that arsenite-mediated cell demise has a partially necrotic phenotype, occurs independently of the extrinsic death receptor pathway of apoptosis, and is not hampered by the absence of functioning caspases. On the contrary, cell death proceeded entirely via an intrinsic, mitochondrial pathway and was efficiently blocked by the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 or Bcl-x L . Here, we address the role of the pro-apoptotic multi-domain Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak. By employing different cell lines deficient for Bax and/or Bak, we demonstrate that Bax- or Bak-deficiency as well as the combined absence only partially blocks arsenite-induced cell death. While the detection of an additive effect of the combined Bax-/Bak-deficiency argues for a non redundant function of Bax and Bak, the persistence of a substantial percentage of arsenite-mediated cell demise in different double deficient cell lines nevertheless suggests a mode of arsenic trioxide-mediated cell death independent from these central inducers of apoptotic cell demise. The presented data add to the notion that arsenic trioxide kills tumor cells independent of the apoptotic machinery, and warrants further investigation on the efficacy of this compound in malignancies with deficiencies of the apoptotic cell death pathways."
