    "abstract_text": "Direct intramuscular injection (IM) of adeno\u2212associated viral (AAV) serotype 2 in humans with hemophilia B (HB) is a promising therapeutic strategy since muscle biopsies obtained >3 years after vector injection demonstrated stable local gene expression. However to achieve therapeutic FIX levels using AAV\u22122 would required hundreds IM injections. The use of alternate AAV serotypes is an attractive strategy since AAV\u22121 or AAV\u22126, resulted in a >10\u2212fold increase in transgene levels compared to AAV\u22122 in large animals, but the immune response to the transgene product has been consistently demonstrated as a major limitation of this strategy. There is growing evidence that blood proteases play an important role in modulating inflammatory and immune responses through activation of PARs. Mice lacking PAR\u22121(\u2212/\u2212) or PAR\u22122(\u2212/\u2212) alleles presented amelioration of immune\u2212 or infection\u2212mediated diseases. Here we sought to determine whether inhibition of PARs could be used as a strategy to prevent immune responses to the FIX following AAV\u2212mediated gene transfer to skeletal muscle. We used PAR\u22121 and PAR\u22122 knockout mice on C57Bl/6 background and littermate mice received IM injection of AAV1\u2212CMV\u2212hFIX. At dose 5x10 11 vg/kg, PAR\u22122 (\u2212/\u2212) mice (n=5) exhibited circulating FIX levels of 500\u00b1 99ng/ml (8\u201310%) which remained stable for the duration of the experiment (10 weeks), and no antibodies for FIX were detected (n=5). In contrast, all PAR\u22122 (+/+) mice (n=4) developed antibodies to FIX which inhibits FIX clotting activity, as determined by Bethesda assay (2.1\u00b1 0.6 BU). However, when similar vector doses were delivered to PAR\u22121(\u2212/\u2212) or PAR\u22121(+/+) (n=4/genotype) mice, antibodies to FIX developed in all animals. We next tested a higher vector dose in PAR\u22122 models. At dose 1x10 12 vg/kg, PAR\u22122(\u2212/\u2212) mice(n=7) resulted in FIX levels of 1,500\u00b1353ng/ml, and again no antibodies for FIX were detected. At the same dose, 6 out of 10 mice of PAR\u22122 (+/+)/(+/\u2212) developed inhibitory antibodies (1.8\u00b1 0.7 BU). Further increase in the vector dose to 5 x 10 12 vg/kg resulted in the development of inhibitor to FIX in both PAR\u22122 (\u2212/\u2212) (4/11 mice, 36%) and PAR\u22122(+/+)/(+/\u2212) (10/17 mice, 60%). This suggests a threshold value in the protective effect in the PAR\u22122 (\u2212/\u2212) model. We sought to assay for FIX\u2212specific T\u2212cell by ELISPOT assay to quantify IFN\u2212\u03b3 secretion from splenocytes of PAR\u22122 (\u2212/\u2212) and PAR\u22122 (+/+) mice injected at 5x10 11 or 1x10 12 vg/kg. No difference in IFN\u2212\u03b3 secretion was observed between PAR\u22122 (\u2212/\u2212) and their controls. Moreover, upon repeated challenges with FIX protein following vector injection antibody to FIX was detected in only 1/4 PAR\u22122 (+/+) mouse and none of 5 PAR\u22122 (\u2212/\u2212). Thus, PAR\u22122 inhibition does not compromise the tolerance to FIX. In a different model, intravenous injection of FIX protein into normal mice upon simultaneous activation of PAR\u22122 by using specific agonist peptide the rates of FIX antibody formation were comparable with those of a control peptide group. Thus, PAR\u22122\u2212mediating antibody formation to FIX may differ among distinct immunologic challenges. Together, these data suggest that PARs play a role in the immune response to FIX and that inhibition of PAR\u22122 (but not PAR\u22121) could be a novel target in preventing inhibitor formation in hemophilia gene therapy and potentially for protein\u2212based therapy.",
