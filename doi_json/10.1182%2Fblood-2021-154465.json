    "abstract_text": "Background: Patients who are diagnosed with hematologic malignant diseases (HMD) almost invariably receive placement of central venous catheters (CVCs), whether temporary or permanent. These catheters are used for administration of various chemotherapies, antibiotics and even nutrition. Although the patients with HMD are immunocompromised, prophylactic use of antibiotics among these patients, especially related to CVC placement, remains controversial. This retrospective analysis evaluates the rates of development of neutropenic fever in patients with HMD with CVCs receiving prophylactic antibiotics. Methods: Data were collected retrospectively in a cohort of 268 patients with HMD who received treatment at our academic institution between 2002 to 2019. Demographic and other related data was abstracted and descriptive analysis was performed using Epi-Info - 7 software. Results : Of the 268 patients with HMD, 175 patients (65.3%) received prophylactic antibiotics and among these patients, 180 (67.2%) had a permanent CVC and 109 (40.7%) had a temporary CVC. Comparatively, 93 patients (34.7%) did not receive prophylactic antibiotics and among these individuals, 64 (68.8%) had a permanent CVC and 34 (36.6%) had a temporary CVC. In patients with a permanent central line, 84.3% of patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics developed neutropenic fever while 85% of those who did not receive prophylactic antibiotic also developed neutropenic fever. Among the individuals with a temporary CVC, 79.7% of patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics developed neutropenic fever and 65.4% of patients who were not receiving prophylactic antibiotics also developed neutropenic fever. None of the differences were statistically significant (p=0.8990 and p=0.1547 respectively). Conclusion: In this cohort of HMD patients, the rate of neutropenic fever development in patients with central venous access receiving prophylactic antibiotic was not significantly different compared to the rate of neutropenic fever development in patients with central venous access who did not receive any prophylactic antibiotic. This data suggests that there does not appear to be a significant clinical utility for prophylactic antibiotics in the prevention of neutropenic fever in patients with HMD who have central venous catheters in place. Further studies analyzing the impact of prophylactic antibiotics on true infections as an etiology for neutropenic fevers in patients with HMD and central venous catheters is warranted.
