    "abstract_text": "MiRNAs are small regulatory RNAs which control gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Tumor cells of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), the so-called Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells, originate from defective germinal center B cells. HRS cells are characterized by their loss of B cell phenotype, large multi-nucleated cell size, a disturbed cell cycle and resistance to undergo apoptosis. The aim of our study is to investigate the role of deregulated miRNA expression to the pathogenesis of HL. To identify genes which are regulated by miRNAs in a high throughput manner, an approach called Ribonucleoprotein ImmunoPrecipitation \u2013 microarray (RIP-CHIP) was applied. As a first step, the AGO2 protein, which is part of the RISC complex, is immunoprecipitated (IP) with an AGO2 specific antibody. RNA isolation of the IP fraction followed by microarray analysis thus leads to the identification of miRNA targets from the whole transcriptome. With this approach, 1255 genes were found to be commonly regulated by miRNAs in both L1236 and L428 HL cell lines. Genes known to be absent or down regulated in HRS cells, like CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and PRDM1 , were included in this gene list. Gene ontology analysis of these candidate miRNA target genes using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) revealed a significant enrichment in KEGG pathways termed p53 signaling pathway and cell cycle. TargetScan prediction and seed sequence search at the 3\u2032UTRs of these genes both indicated that about half of these genes were targets of the highly abundant miRNAs found in Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines. 10 randomly selected target genes were analyzed using luciferase reporter assays. For all genes, targeting by the predicted miRNA was confirmed using specific antisense Locked Nucleic Acids (LNA) inhibitors. In conclusion, we demonstrated an approach for large scale identification of endogenous miRNA targets without prior manipulation of the cells. HL specific target genes that may contribute to the characteristic phenotype of HRS cells and to the malignant transformation of germinal center B cells were identified."
