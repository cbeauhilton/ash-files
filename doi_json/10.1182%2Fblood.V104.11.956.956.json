    "abstract_text": "The critical importance of specific proteins including Bcl-2, Mcl-1, XIAP, Bax, Caspase-3, Traf-1, and ZAP70 in predicting disease progression, prognosis, and response to therapy in CLL have been extensively studied through in vitro experiments. We now report molecular data obtained from a large prospective clinical trial involving 278 previously untreated patients with CLL. This ECOG-led intergroup trial involved participation from CALGB and SWOG, and currently provides quantitative information regarding protein levels on 217 cases assessed immediately prior to treatment. NCI criteria for therapy in CLL were met before patients were randomized to receive either Fludarabine or Fludarabine plus Cytoxan. On-study analyses included: interphase cytogenetics by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), p53 mutational analysis, immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IgV H ) gene rearrangement, and quantitative analysis of the aforementioned specific proteins. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from each patient at registration before starting therapy. Lysates were prepared from the patient cells and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis using the multiple antigen detection method previously developed by our group. Detection was performed by an enhanced chemiluminescence method and quantified by densitometry. Expression levels were calculated relative to expression in the Jurkat T cell line (for ZAP70) or the RS11846 lymphoblastoid cell line (for apoptosis-related proteins). Using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test, molecular data were compared with FISH and IgV H mutational status. Patients with either p53 mutations or del(17p) had significantly lower levels of XIAP (p=0.022). Patients with del(11q) had significantly higher Bcl-2/Bax ratios (p=0.052). Patients with trisomy 12 had lower levels of Bcl-2 (p=0.066); higher Mcl-1 (p=0.026); higher Bax (p=0.09); and higher Caspase-3 (p=0.019) levels. Interestingly, these specimens also had lower ratios of Bcl-2/Bax (p=0.0016). Patients with del(13q) had significantly higher levels of Bcl-2 (p=0.0059) lower levels of Caspase-3 (p=0.047), and higher Bcl-2/Bax ratios (p=0.0569). IgV H mutated patients had significantly lower levels of Caspase-3 using either a 98% cut-off (p=0.0008) or the 97% cut-off (p<0.0001). Finally, patients with higher ZAP70 protein expression had significantly higher levels of Caspase-3 (p=0.0099) and Traf-1 (p=0.016). In 163 patients evaluable for both response and the molecular studies, either elevation of Bcl-2 protein (p= 0.01) or an abnormality of p53 (either del 17p or a p53 mutation) (p=0.08) correlated significantly with attainment of a complete remission. Potential opportunities to predict response to therapy in CLL will hopefully identify those patients likely to benefit from therapy. Based upon our previous work, these molecular parameters can be modulated both in vitro and in vivo . Therefore, understanding the relationship of these important proteins to therapeutic response can facilitate strategic plans to circumvent drug resistance to chemotherapy and immunotherapy in CLL.",
