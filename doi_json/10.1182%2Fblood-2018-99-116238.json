    "abstract_text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a single nucleotide mutation in the \u03b2-globin gene, resulting in an altered red cell physiology that causes vascular complications such as hemolytic anemia, chronic inflammation, activation of coagulation, and vaso-occlusion. We have shown that infusion of hemin results in tissue factor (TF)-dependent activation of coagulation in mice. Furthermore, TF-dependent activation of coagulation contributes to inflammation in a mouse model of SCD. Interestingly, thrombin-dependent inflammation in sickle cell mice was not attenuated by deficiency of the main thrombin receptor protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1). However, others have shown that the activation of endothelial cell PAR-1 with agonist peptide enhances interactions of these cells with sickle RBCs in a P-selectin-dependent manner. Importantly, P-selectin inhibition reduces microvascular stasis in mouse models of SCD and prevents vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell patients. We propose that thrombin-mediated PAR-1 activation promotes microvascular stasis in mouse models of SCD via increased expression of P-selectin and VWF on the endothelium, triggered by exocytosis of Weibel-Palade bodies. To investigate if the TF/thrombin/PAR-1 pathway contributes to microvascular stasis, dorsal skinfold chambers were implanted in NY1DD sickle mice 3 days before the experiment. Microvascular stasis was determined in 20-25 preselected micro-vessels in response to intravenous infusion of stroma-free hemoglobin (SFH, 1.6 \u00b5mol/kg) and was expressed as % non-flowing vessels (mean \u00b1 SEM). We previously demonstrated that infusion of SFH results in microvascular stasis that is inhibited by hemopexin in NY1DD mice, indicating that hemoglobin releases heme into the circulation. In NY1DD mice treated with control IgG antibody, SFH infusion caused stasis in 28.3 \u00b1 1.7% and 36.7 \u00b1 1.7% of preselected vessels at 1 and 4 hrs after infusion, respectively. Treatment with an inhibitory anti-TF antibody 1H1 (25 mg/kg; IP) 30 minutes before SFH infusion significantly reduced stasis to only 3.3 \u00b1 1.5% and 2.8 \u00b1 1.6% of vessels at 1 and 4 hrs, respectively (p<0.01). To investigate if TF contributes to SFH-induced microvascular stasis via generation of downstream coagulation proteases, NY1DD mice were fed with control chow or chow containing either Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor rivaroxaban (0.4 mg/g chow) or thrombin inhibitor dabigatran (10 mg/g chow) ad libitum for 4 days prior to stasis experiments. We previously showed that these doses efficiently anticoagulated sickle mice without bleeding complications. FXa inhibition significantly reduced stasis at 1 hr (4.9 \u00b1 0.1% versus 22.4 \u00b1 3.8%, p<0.001) and 4 hrs (1.7 \u00b1 1.6% versus 12.8 \u00b1 1.9%, p<0.001) after SFH injection. Similarly, dabigatran also significantly attenuated SFH-induced stasis (3.1 \u00b1 1.5% non-flowing vessels at 1 hour and 1.6 \u00b1 1.6% non-flowing vessels at 4 hours). Next, to investigate if thrombin contributes to SFH-induced stasis through activation of PAR-1, we used bone marrow transplantation to generate sickle mice lacking PAR-1 expression in all non-hematopoietic cells. PAR-1 +/+ and PAR-1 -/- mice were lethally irradiated and transplanted with bone marrow from Townes sickle (SS) mice. Efficient reconstitution of bone marrow was confirmed by hemoglobin electrophoresis. We found that PAR-1 -/- SS mice were significantly protected from SFH-induced stasis compared to PAR-1 +/+ SS mice at both 1 hr (13.2 \u00b1 3.4% versus 37.6 \u00b1 3.9% stasis; P<0.001) and 4 hrs (6.6 \u00b1 1.7% versus 18.0 \u00b1 1.5% stasis; p<0.05) after hemoglobin challenge. We have previously shown that a monoclonal antibody to murine P-selectin or a polyclonal antibody to VWF markedly inhibit stasis in sickle mice. After the 4 hr stasis measurement, lungs were harvested from PAR-1 +/+ SS and PAR-1 -/- SS the mice and stained for P-selectin, VWF, and CD31 (a marker for endothelial cells). We found that intensity of P-selectin and VWF staining was markedly reduced in the lungs of PAR-1 -/- SS mice compared to the staining observed in lungs of PAR-1 +/+ SS mice. Our data indicates that SFH-induced microvascular stasis is significantly diminished by inhibition of TF, FXa, or thrombin activity or knockout of endothelial PAR-1, which leads to reduced expression of P-selectin and VWF on endothelium in a mouse model of SCD. We speculate that inhibiting the TF/thrombin/PAR-1 axis may reduce vaso-occlusive crises in SCD patients. Disclosures Vercellotti: CSL Behring: Research Funding.
