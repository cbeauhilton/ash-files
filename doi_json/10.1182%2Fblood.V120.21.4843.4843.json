    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4843 Regulatory B cells (Bregs) are a unique CD5 + /CD1d + /IL10 + B cell subtype which has novel immunosuppressive capabilities. It remains to be determined if subjects suffering from autoimmune ailments such as multiple sclerosis (MS) display a defect in number or function of Bregs in association with their disease. Our hypothesis is that total B cell number, and Breg subset in particular, is distinct when comparing peripheral blood B cell populations from MS to healthy controls (HC). This study herein focuses on establishing a phenotypic baseline of the peripheral B cell profile. The total number of CD19 + B cells in HC is 892\u00b1816 cells/\u03bcL (average \u00b1SD, n=28), of which CD5 + /CD1d + Breg subset is 4.6\u00b15.6 cells/\u03bcL. We found a greater number of B cells in MS subjects, 1441\u00b11011 cells/\u03bcL (n=22, p<0.05, Student's t-test). However, the number of Bregs in MS patients is not significantly different from HC, 7.5\u00b17.6 cells/\u03bcL (p=0.13). We further interrogated the phenotype of B cells in MS subjects and found that there is an increased number of CD27 \u2212 IgD + nai\u0308ve/intermediate phenotype in MS, 1041\u00b1794 cells/\u03bcL, versus HC, 624\u00b1606 cells/\u03bcL (p<0.05). Our findings demonstrate that MS is not associated with a deficiency in the absolute number of CD5 + /CD1d + Bregs but rather a 60% increase in CD27 \u2212 IgD + B cells. We hypothesize that altered B cell distribution may be functionally associated to the underlying immune disease process of MS. This finding may inform the design of clinical trials examining B cell depletion strategies for treatment of MS. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
