    "abstract_text": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains eventually fatal in 30-40% of the patients, despite intensive chemotherapy (CHOP) in combination with rituximab. A subgroup of chemotherapy-refractory DLBCL is characterized by high expression levels of both pro- and anti-apoptotic genes, including MCL-1. Alternative splicing of the MCL-1 gene results in a Bcl-2-like anti-apoptotic MCL-1L protein and a BH3-only pro-apoptotic MCL-1S protein. In the present study, we investigated if a switch in alternative splicing of MCL-1 is involved in apoptosis-resistance in primary lymphoma cells of 20 DLBCL patients and 5 DLBCL cell lines. RT-MLPA analysis revealed that MCL-1L and MCL-1S are both expressed in all tested DLBCL samples and DLBCL cell lines, however expression levels varied strongly. An imbalance between the expression levels of MCL-1L and MCL-1S to an anti-apoptotic status was observed in DLBCL patient cells and DLBCL cell lines, especially in activated B-cell like (ABC)-DLBCL, compared to tonsillar germinal center B-cells. MCL-1 mRNA expression was confirmed at protein level using immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that MCL-1L inhibited apoptosis by binding of Bak in MCL-1L positive DLBCL cell lines. Knockdown of MCL-1L with siRNA analysis resulted in induction of apoptosis in both GCB- and ABC-DLBCL cell lines and also in increased sensitivity to the conventional chemotherapeutical drugs etoposide. Downregulation of MCL-1L using flavopiridol induced apoptotic cell death of MCL-1L-positive DLBCL cells with low Bcl-2 expression. In summary, a switch in alternative splicing of MCL-1 occurs in a subgroup of DLBCL leading to an increase in the level of anti-apoptotic MCL-1L that contributes to therapy-resistance. These preclinical data suggest that targeting of MCL-1L might be a therapeutic option for MCL-1L positive DLBCL. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
