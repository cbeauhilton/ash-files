    "abstract_text": "Background. Bispecific antibodies that target tumors by engaging innate-like T cell subsets with inherent antitumor activity, such as V\u03b39V\u03b42-T and type 1 natural killer T (NKT) cells, may combine high therapeutic efficacy with limited off-tumor toxicity. Type 1 NKT cells respond to self and foreign (glyco)lipid antigens presented in the context of the MHC class I like molecule CD1d which is expressed on various malignancies. V\u03b39V\u03b42-T cells respond to intracellular accumulation of phosphoantigens in cancer cells by sensing conformational alterations in the butyrophilin (BTN) 2A1-3A1 complex. CD1d is expressed by the majority of patients with CLL and MM, while expression in AML is most pronounced on (myelo)monocytic subtypes. Methods. LAVA-051 is a 27kD humanized bispecific single domain antibody (bsVHH) that directly engages CD1d and the V\u03b42-TCR chain of V\u03b39V\u03b42-T cells. The anti-CD1d VHH specifically stabilizes the interaction between CD1d and the type 1 NKT cell TCR and thereby triggers strong activation of type 1 NKT cells (Nature Cancer 2020;1:1054-1065). V\u03b39V\u03b42-T and type 1 NKT effector cell activation, proliferation, cytokine production and target cell lysis were assessed in in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies. Due to lack of cross reactivity of LAVA-051 with non-human primate (NHP) CD1d and V\u03b39V\u03b42-T cells, a cross-reactive surrogate bispecific engager was generated to assess tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters. Results. The CD1d-V\u03b42 bsVHH LAVA-051 triggers activation of both V\u03b39V\u03b42-T and type 1 NKT cells (EC 50 4 pM for V\u03b39V\u03b42-T and 366 pM for type 1 NKT; induction of > 80% degranulation in 4h assays) and mediates potent killing of CD1d expressing tumor cells by engagement of V\u03b39V\u03b42-T and/or type 1 NKT cells (EC 50 1 pM for V\u03b39V\u03b42-T and 216 pM for type 1 NKT; > 85% target cell lysis in 16h assays at a low 1:2 E:T ratio). Further, LAVA-051 triggered pro-inflammatory cytokine production, proliferation of V\u03b39V\u03b42-T and type 1 NKT cells, and exerted substantial antitumor activity against patient AML, CLL and MM cells that express CD1d and improved survival in in vivo T-ALL, AML and MM mouse models. Multiple dose studies in NHP (7 daily doses up to 1 mg/kg iv) showed clear V\u03b39V\u03b42-T cell engagement and some cytokine release after the first administration, but no clinical, laboratory, or histopathological toxicity. Reflecting the low molecular size of this bispecific engager, PK studies revealed a short plasma half-life which was however compensated for by prolonged (up to 5 days) binding of the engager to peripheral blood V\u03b39V\u03b42-T cells allowing intermittent dosing. Conclusions. In this study, we demonstrate that the CD1d-V\u03b42 bsVHH LAVA-051 triggers activation of both type 1 NKT and V\u03b39V\u03b42-T cells, which translates directly into antitumor activity. Based on the expression of CD1d in CLL, MM, and AML, the strong preclinical activity of LAVA-051 against CD1d-expresssing tumors, and the favorable tolerability profile of the surrogate engager in NHP, LAVA-051 is currently evaluated in a first-in-human clinical Phase 1/2a study in patients with CD1d-expressing CLL, MM, or AML refractory to prior therapy (NCT04887259).
