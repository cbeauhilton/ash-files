    "abstract_text": "SH2-containing-5\u2032inositol phosphatase-1 (SHIP), via removal of the 5\u2032 phosphate group from PI (3,4,5) P3 (PIP3), influences signals downstream of cytokine/chemokine receptors that play a key role in megakaryocytopoiesis. Thombopoietin (TPO) influences megakaryocytes (MK) development by controlling their proliferation, differentiation and survival. SHIP phosphorylation, resulting from TPO receptor activation (c-mpl) influences MK cycling and proliferation. Stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) induces transendothelial MK migration facilitating platelet shedding. SHIP-deficient myeloid progenitors exhibit enhanced chemotaxis towards SDF-1/CXCL-12, indicating SHIP influences signaling downstream of its receptor (CXCR-4). In addition, colony-forming-unit-MK are decreased in SHIP\u2212/\u2212 bone marrow (BM) and SHIP regulates PIP3 levels after thrombin or collagen platelet activation. To further explore SHIP effects on megakaryocytopoiesis, we measured MK compartment size, by flow cytometry, in mice with SHIP promoter/first exon deletion (SHIP\u2212/\u2212) and with inositol phosphatase deletion (SHIP\u0394IP/\u0394IP) in order to confirm that the observed phenotype is highly penetrant. Lin\u2212 cKit+ CD41+ (n=5/strain), representing MK progenitors (MKP), were statistically significantly increased in BM (3-fold in SHIP\u2212/\u2212 and SHIP\u0394IP/\u0394IP), spleen (18-fold in SHIP\u2212/\u2212; 50.8-fold in SHIP\u0394IP/\u0394IP) and peripheral blood (PB) (2.4-fold in SHIP\u0394IP/\u0394IP) compared to their wild type (WT) littermates; not reaching statistical significance in SHIP\u2212/\u2212 PB (1.6-fold). These findings suggest that SHIP may control MKP homeostasis. Lin\u2212 cKit- CD41+ (n=5), representing mature MK, were statistically significantly decreased in BM (2.6-fold in SHIP\u2212/\u2212; 2.2-fold in SHIP\u0394IP/\u0394IP), increased in spleen (11-fold in SHIP\u2212/\u2212; 26.7-fold in SHIP\u0394IP/\u0394IP) and PB (7.7-fold in SHIP\u2212/\u2212; 2.6-fold in SHIP\u0394IP/\u0394IP); suggesting that SHIP may control MK redistribution. BM histopathology and Glycoprotein IIB/IIIa (CD41) immuno-staining showed that MK numbers were similar in SHIP\u2212/\u2212 and WT, although morphologically we detected hypolobulated/micro (HM) MK in SHIP\u2212/\u2212 and hyperlobulated (HL) MK in WT mice, consistent with MKP and MK flow cytometry phenotype respectively. Spleen histopathology and CD41 immuno-staining showed that the MK numbers were increased in SHIP\u2212/\u2212; cells with HM and HL morphology were present. These findings suggest that SHIP may control pathways that mediate MK localization and/or migration. Mean platelet numbers (0.95 x 10 6 /\u03bcL SHIP\u2212/\u2212; 0.75 x 10 6 /\u03bcL SHIP\u0394IP/\u0394IP) were not significantly different compared to WT (1x 10 6 /\u03bcL SHIP\u2212/\u2212 and SHIP\u0394IP/\u0394IP) although splenomegaly in SHIP\u2212/\u2212 animals may prevent an increase in circulating platelets. In conclusion, SHIP regulates essential signaling pathways that control megakaryocytopoiesis in vivo. SHIP enzymatic activity could be targeted to increase MKP pool to enable this compartment to replenish platelets more rapidly following chemotherapy and radiation treatment."
