    "abstract_text": "Background: Nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), a transcription factor essential for inflammatory responses, is constitutively activated in many lymphomas. Pelabresib (CPI-0610) is a first-in-class, oral, small-molecule inhibitor of the tandem amino-terminal bromodomains (BD1 and BD2) of bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, which regulate gene expression pathways. In preclinical studies, pelabresib downregulated NF-\u03baB signaling and demonstrated antitumor activity in vitro. Here we report the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety and tolerability, and preliminary efficacy results from the first-in-human Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study of pelabresib in patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory lymphomas (NCT01949883). Methods: Adults with relapsed non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma after at least one prior therapy or who were not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (HD-ASCT) or had refused HD-ASCT were enrolled. Pts were required to have platelet count \u226575 \u00d7 10 9 /L, absolute neutrophil count \u22651.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of \u22642. Pelabresib was administered under fasting conditions orally once daily (QD) for 14 days followed by a 7-day break in continuous 21-day cycles. Cohorts of three to six pts were sequentially enrolled with increasing doses of pelabresib (6, 12, 24, 48, 80, 120, 170, 230 and 300 mg with the capsule formulation, and 125 and 225 mg QD with the micronized tablet formulation) to assess maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Results: A total of 64 lymphoma pts, with a median of four prior therapies, were enrolled and treated with pelabresib, 47 pts with the capsule formulation and 17 pts with the tablet formulation. Pelabresib exhibited dose-proportional exposure with rapid absorption, with maximum plasma concentrations reached at 2.9 hours post dose. Plasma concentrations declined in a generally monophasic manner with a half-life of ~16 hours. Following 14 days of QD dosing, accumulation of pelabresib plasma concentrations was low (~40%), confirming the suitability of a QD dosing schedule. The tablet formulation displayed increased bioavailability compared with the capsule formulation (75 vs 60 %, respectively) and was selected for use in subsequent trials. PD analysis demonstrated appreciable suppression of interleukin-8 ( IL8 ) and C-C motif chemokine receptor 1 ( CCR1 ) mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells at capsule doses greater than or equal to 120 and 170 mg, respectively, and for both tablet dose levels (125 and 225 mg) of pelabresib. Decreased expression of both IL8 and CCR1 were seen as early as 2 hours post dose, suggesting rapid transcriptional regulation following treatment. A total of 8 pts among all dosing groups had a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during cycle 1 (hematologic changes [n = 5], gastrointestinal events [n = 2], and rash [n=1]). All 64 pts had \u22651 treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) during the study; 44 (68.8%) pts had \u22651 TEAE of Grade 3 or higher. The most common TEAEs (>20%) were fatigue, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, thrombocytopenia, platelet count decreased, anemia, and lymphocyte count decreased. Gastrointestinal TEAEs were common but mostly low grade and easily manageable. Thrombocytopenia, frequently reported hematological TEAE and a class effect for all BET inhibitors, was dose dependent in both frequency and intensity, reversible, non-cumulative and not associated with bleeding events. There was a strong dose-dependent correlation of platelet count. There were no treatment related deaths. Four pts had an objective response (two complete responses in pts treated with 48 mg and 230 mg and two partial responses in pts treated with 230 mg and 300 mg), and five pts had prolonged (>6 months) stable disease, as per Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (2007). Conclusions: Pelabresib has a wide therapeutic index capable of BET target gene suppression with an acceptable safety profile. As previously reported, the MTD was 225 mg (Blum KA, et al. Ann Oncol 2018;29(Suppl 3):mdy048). Due to the dose dependent nature of the observed platelet count decrease, the 125 mg dose (with the ability to titrate up to 225 mg, if needed) was selected and is currently being studied in Phase 2 (MANIFEST; NCT02158858) and Phase 3 (MANIFEST-2; NCT04603495) trials of pts with myelofibrosis.
