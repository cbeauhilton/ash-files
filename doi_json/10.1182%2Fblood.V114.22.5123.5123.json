    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5123 Background The term autolymphocyte therapy refers to an adoptive cellular transfer strategy based on the ex vivo activation of memory T cells. The assumption is that because patients with metastatic cancer have been previously exposed to tumor antigens, memory T cells exist which can be collected and activated ex vivo. The result in autologous cytokines that can be used to activate other T cells. The method is simpler than it sounds and basically consisted of 2 cell collections using a cell separator and 2 cell cultures. The supernatant from the first culture, which contains the desired cytokines, is used to activate the second cohort of T cells. Objective To establish a preparative method of autologous memory T lymphocyte and use this T lymphocyte to treat hematologic malignancies and solid tumor. Method 14 patients of hematologic malignancies and solid tumor had autolymphocyte therapy in 4 hospitals since 2002(Plasmacytoma1,NHL1, colon cancer3,HCC3,NSCLC1, nasopharyngeal carcinoma3, breast cancer1, Ovarian cancer1). These patients, including 11 male and 3 female, with a mean age of 55 (range, 25-71), were finally confirmed by pathology and histology autologouslymphokine, anti-CD3 antibody, IL-2. Cimetidine and Indomethacin induced peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) ex vivo to memory T lymphocyte by two steps. We tested memory T lymphocyte by flow cytometry before and after culture, we observed side effect during infusion. Result After culturing peripheral blood lymphocyte for 9 days, the number of cell and CD4+/CD45RO+T cell increased. The data demonstrated: PBMC before culture was 1.07-67.2\u00d710 9 (median was 2.16\u00d710 9 ),the cell after culture was 2.0-6.5\u00d710 9 (median was 3.2\u00d710 9 ),CD4+/CD45RO+T cell rate was 27.59-86%(median was 77.76%) before culture and 82.09-99.55%(median was 89.49%) after culture. The absolute number of CD4+/CD45RO+T cell increased. Among 14 patients after infusion, one patient who had no medicine before infusion had fever of 39\u00b0C, 4 patients had low-grade fever and the rest 9 patients had no side effect. Follow-up: 5 patients abroad had no follow-up. In 1 to 10 months after therapy, all patients were alive. 4 patients were in partial remission and 5 patients in stable stage. Conclusion Autologous memory T lymphocyte is a safe and an effective way to treat advanced-stage hematologic malignancies and solid tumor. The mechanism and long-tem effect need more research and observe. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
