    "abstract_text": "Background: Sorafenib is an orally active multi-kinase inhibitor with potent activity against the Raf/ERK/MEK pathway, VEGFR, PDGFR-\u03b2, and c-KIT. In vitro , it has growth-inhibitory effects in several AML cell lines with or without constitutive activation of ERK signaling. Sorafenib selectively induces cell growth arrest and apoptosis in FLT3-mutant human AML cell lines at nM concentrations. In a phase I study of single agent sorafenib in patients (pts) with AML escalating doses were well tolerated with no myelosuppression and with significant clinical activity predominantly (but not exclusively) in FLT3 mutated pts. Methods: This study was conducted to determine the tolerability and efficacy of combination of sorafenib with cytarabine 1.5 g/m 2 iv over 24 hours daily \u00d7 4 (\u00d7 3 for pts over 60) and idarubicin 12 mg/m 2 iv daily \u00d7 3. In the phase I portion of study, pts with relapsed AML were treated with escalating doses of sorafenib po (400 mg qod, 400 mg daily and 400 mg bid) for 7 days during induction, and 400 mg bid was established as a safe dose for phase II evaluation. Pts achieving CR receive up to 5 courses of consolidation with idarubicin 8 mg/m 2 iv daily \u00d7 2 and cytarabine 0.75 g/m 2 iv daily \u00d7 3 in addition to continuous sorafenib 400 mg po bid for up to 28 days per cycle. Maintenance with sorafenib 400 mg bid would continue for up to a year after consolidation. Results: Ten pts (median age 34 years, range 21\u201358) with relapsed AML (median prior therapy 2, range 1\u20136) were treated on the phase I portion. Seven had FLT3-ITD mutation (5 with high mutation burden, 2 with low), and 3 were negative. Four achieved CR, and 6 failed. In the phase II portion, 30 pts (including 8 with FLT3-ITD and 2 with FLT3-TKD) have been treated. Median age is 53 years (range 18 \u2013 65) Cytogenetics were diploid in 13, +8 in 3, \u22125/\u22127 in 3, t(9;11) in 1, miscellaneous in 6, and unavailable in 4. The median presentation WBC was 4.6 \u00d7 10 9 /L (range 1.5 \u2013122.7 \u00d7 10 9 /L). FLT3 mutation burden was low in blasts from 4 pts, and high in 6). Five pts were FLT3-ITD+/NPM1-. Among 25 evaluable pts, 22 (88%) have achieved CR (n=19), or CRi (n=3); 1 achieved PR, 1 died at induction from pneumonia, 1 was resistant; 5 pts are too early. The regimen is well tolerated and grade 3 adverse events thought to be possibly related to the study combination have included elevation of transaminases (3), hyperbilirubinemia (4), small bowel obstruction (1), diarrhea (2), rash (2), pericarditis (1), elevated creatinine (1), and atrial fibrillation (1). Median follow-up is 8 weeks (range, 1 \u2013 28) with the probability of survival at 6 months of 87%; 2 pts have relapsed with CR durations of 2 and 3 months. Samples from 8 pts were studied prior to and 24\u201348 hours post sorafenib administration, and prior to chemotherapy. In six pts (75%), sorafenib alone induced apoptosis in peripheral blood blasts and in CD33/CD34 positive leukemia progenitor cells as determined by flow cytometry. Expression of phospho-ERK (pERK) was detectable by flow cytometry in 5 out of 7 samples tested at baseline; 24-hour exposure to sorafenib resulted in >50% downregulation of pERK in 3 of the 5 samples. Plasma inhibitory assay was performed using day 7 samples from 10 pts; mutant FLT3 was suppressed by all samples with 5-fold more potent suppression against mutant versus wildtype FLT3. Conclusions: Combination of sorafenib with idarubicin and cytarabine is safe and has a high CR rate in frontline therapy of younger pts with AML. Correlative studies confirm potent activity of sorafenib against ERK and FLT3 signaling.",
