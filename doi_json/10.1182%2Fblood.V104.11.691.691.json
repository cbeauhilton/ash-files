    "abstract_text": "Coagulation proteases are crucial for hemostasis and have also been implicated in inflammatory responses, blood vessel formation, and tumor cell metastasis. Cellular responses triggered by proteases are mediated by protease-activated receptors (PAR). Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-2 vectors hold promise for the treatment of several diseases and were already tested in Phase I studies for hemophilia B following intramuscular or hepatic artery deliveries. Previously, we determined an unexpected inhibitory effect (60\u201370% downregulation) on AAV-2 and adenovirus mediated gene transfer by thrombin- or FXa inhibitors. These results were independent of mouse strain, transgene product, or vector promoter, and gene expression by vectors of alternate serotypes AAV-5 or -8, which do not share cellular receptors with AAV-2, were not affected by any drug. Here we present in vivo evidence of a novel role of coagulation proteases and PARs in modulating gene transfer by viral vectors. We tested AAV-2 gene transfer efficacy in (a) animal models for proteases deficiency [FX and FIX deficient animals], (b) PAR-1 or PAR-2 deficient mice, (c) and following in vivo activation of PARs. FX knockout mice with residual activity of only 1\u20133% of normal (n=9) were injected with AAV-2-human(h)FIX vector and compared to littermates with FX levels of 50% (n=4). FIX expression levels were 2-fold lower among FX-deficient mice compared to controls (p<0.03). The second model, FIX deficient mice, received AAV expressing \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin (AAT-1). Severe hemophilia B models due to large-gene deletion (n=5) or missense mutation (R180T) in the FIX gene (n=3, <1% FIX) were compared to littermate controls with normal FIX levels (n=6). The results showed that AAT-1 levels among hemophilia B mice were 2-fold lower than in controls (24 vs 48 ng/ml, p<0.05, respectively). Because PAR activation by thrombin enhances \u03b1V\u03b25 (co-receptor for AAV-2 and adenovirus)-dependent cellular function (JBC 276:10952) we hypothesized that PAR modulates AAV-2 gene transfer. Homozygous (\u2212/\u2212) or heterozygous deficient (+/\u2212) PAR-1 (n=24) or PAR-2 (n=25) mice received AAV-2-hF.IX and were compared to littermate controls (+/+). FIX levels among PAR-1 controls (1.9 \u03bcg/ml) were comparable to levels obtained among heterozygotes but higher than in homozygotes (1.1 \u03bcg/ml, p<0.02). Similarly, PAR-2 deficient mice presented 2-fold lower FIX levels than controls (0.7 vs 1.3 \u03bcg/ml, p<0.02) whereas heterozygous mice presented intermediate levels. To further confirm the role of PARs in AAV-2 gene transfer we activated PARs prior to AAV-2 injection. C57BL/6 mice received specific peptide agonists at doses ranging from 10 to 60 \u03bcM/kg (n=4 per dose and per peptide) and were compared to controls receiving scramble peptide. FIX levels increased 1.5 to 5-fold in a dose-dependent manner and the activation of PAR-1 and -2 simultaneously was superior to single peptide. Gene copy monitoring revealed low vector uptake by livers of PAR knockout mice while activation of PARs increased uptake. In conclusion, these data demonstrated a novel in vivo role of coagulation proteases and PARs on viral vectors (AAV-2 and adenovirus)-mediated gene expression and provide an alternative target to modulate gene therapy strategies.",
