    "abstract_text": "Over-expression of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) is a hallmark of many inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and septic shock and hepatitis, making it a potential therapeutic target for clinical interventions. To date, significant advances have been made in the development of biological agents targeting TNF\u03b1 and its signaling components. There are several well known commercial TNF\u03b1 inhibitors, such as infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept, all of which are TNF\u03b1 antibodies or TNFR1-Fc chimeras and function to prevent TNF\u03b1 from binding to its receptor. Those biomacromolecular agents have been proved to be effective in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis due to their unique superiorities such as high specificity. However, several severe limitations such as poor stability, cost-ineffective commercial-scale production and exclusion from blood/brain barrier have also emerged. Instead, small-molecule chemical compounds have been appreciated as appropriate alternatives for overcoming most disadvantages associated with macromolecular inhibitors. Furthermore, they offer additional clinical benefits such as simpler preparation for oral medicine. Now by the use of computer-aided drug design (CADD) and cell-based assays in vitro, several selective small-molecule antagonists of TNF\u03b1 activity have been identified. They include broad-spectrum inhibitors targeting the key molecules of the intracellular TNF\u03b1 pathway, functionally uncharacterized inhibitors of TNF\u03b1 expression, inhibitors of the processing enzyme TNF\u03b1 converting enzyme (TACE), and molecules that directly bind to TNFR or prevent TNF\u03b1-TNFR interactions. Although the small-molecule inhibitors are capable of blocking the biological activity of TNF\u03b1 in vitro, few have been shown to abrogate or reduce TNF\u03b1-induced inflammatory responses in vivo and exhibit high IC50 and severe side effects. Also, none of the small-molecular inhibitors have been reported to successfully block TNF\u03b1\u2019s interaction with TNFR through direct binding to TNF\u03b1. Thus, development of small molecules for TNF\u03b1 therapy remains a major challenge. In this study, to explore chemical inhibitors against TNF\u03b1 activity, we applied CADD combined with in vitro and cell-based assays and identified a lead chemical compound (named as C87 thereafter) from a compound library including about 90,000 small molecular compounds, which directly binds to TNF\u03b1 indicated by SPR assay, and it potently inhibits TNF\u03b1-induced cytotoxicity (IC50=8.73\u03bcM) and effectively blocks TNF\u03b1\u2013triggered signaling activities. More importantly, by using a murine acute hepatitis model, we showed that C87 attenuates TNF\u03b1-induced inflammation, thereby markedly reducing injuries to the liver and improving animal survival. Thus, our results lead to a novel and highly specific small-molecule TNF\u03b1 inhibitor, which can be potentially used to treat TNF\u03b1 mediated inflammatory diseases.
