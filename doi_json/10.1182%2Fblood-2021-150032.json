    "abstract_text": "Despite significant improvements in myeloma (MM) therapies, patients (pts) refractory to immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs), proteasome inhibitors (PIs) and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Daratumumab (DARA), an anti-CD38 mAb, is active in pts with relapsed/refractory MM through mechanisms that include complement-dependent and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, apoptosis and immunomodulation. DARA + IMiDs have substantial efficacy, probably through the combination of their immune and microenvironmental effects. The mechanisms of resistance are not fully elucidated but resistance to DARA may be reversed by addition of IMiDs and vice versa, as previously shown (Gavriatopoulou Blood 2019, Nooka Cancer 2019). We prospectively evaluated the combination of DARA + IMiD following refractoriness to both agents, to assess clinical activity but also to longitudinally assess immune cell populations in the peripheral blood (PB) in order to understand the resulting immunomodulation. Consecutive PB samples from 35 pts refractory to an IMiD (LEN or POM) and progressing on DARA monotherapy were analyzed. The last IMiD on which each patient was refractory was added without modulating DARA backbone (RESET). In consenting pts, PB samples were collected at the time of DARA initiation, at progression to DARA monotherapy and IMiD addition, at response and at progression to DARA-IMiD. Samples were viably frozen and analyzed using specific two 8-color panels. Panel 1: CD38-FITC, Granzyme B-PE, CD127-PeCy7, CD25-APC, CD4-APCCy7, CD3-BV510, Lag-3-BV421 and 7-AAD as viability dye; panel 2: CD14-FITC, CD56-PE, CD66-b-PeCy7, CD80-APC, CD45-APCCy7, CD3/CD19-BV510, CD16-BV421 and 7-AAD as viability dye. Pts' median age was 73 years (range 52-86; 66% male); median prior treatment lines were 3 (range 1-16); all had prior exposure and refractoriness to at least one PI; all were refractory to LEN and 51% to POM, 40% had prior ASCT. The IMiD added was the last used prior to DARA, i.e., LEN in 49% (17/35) and POM in 51% (18/35). Median duration of DARA monotherapy prior to RESET was 7.9 months (range 1-38) and 64% responded (\u2265PR) before progression. Median duration of RESET therapy was 5.5 months (range 0.46 to 23.86) and 43% had \u2265PR (\u2265MR: 60%) [including VGPR: 8.6% (n=3), PR: 34.3% (n=12), MR: 17.1% (n=6), SD/NR: 28.6% (n=10), PD: 11.4% (n=4)]. Median PFS was 5 months (95% CI 1.5-8.4) and median OS was 19 months (95% CI 13.5-24.5). Based on response at 3-month landmark, PFS was 9 months for pts who achieved \u2265 PR vs 4 months for < PR (p=0.031). PFS and response to RESET were independent of type or dose of IMiD, prior response to DARA monotherapy or IMiD, number of prior treatments, ISS at diagnosis or at time of RESET. Multivariate flow cytometry analysis showed significant heterogeneity between pts (n=20). After DARA monotherapy there was an increase in CD8+ T cells compared to baseline which persisted throughout DARA-containing therapy with CD4+ T remaining at similar levels at all time-points. Total Tregs reduced after DARA start; however, within Tregs the relative proportion of Lag3+ Tregs tended to increase during DARA monotherapy. NK cell levels were significantly reduced after DARA and remained low throughout DARA therapy, with no recovery after IMiD addition; within NKs, we noticed an increase of CD16-/CD56+ immunomodulatory/cytokine producing and, to a lesser extent, of CD56-/CD16+ cytotoxic subsets compared to mature CD56+/CD16+ NK cells which tended to decrease, especially during DARA monotherapy. Although the samples at response to DARA/IMiD combination are few (n=10), CD56-CD16+ NK cell percentages at the time of progression to DARA were associated with response to DARA/IMiD. Finally, there was a noticeable increase in M1- and a decrease in M2-type macrophage subsets at response to DARA/IMiD. In conclusion, retaining DARA backbone therapy may be associated with clinically relevant activity (ORR 43%, 5 months median PFS) among pts refractory toDARA and IMiD, when these drugs are combined. Longitudinal evaluation of PB immune cell composition showed DARA-specific immunomodulation, which was not altered after addition of IMiDs, but may be related to restoration of sensitivity to the DARA/IMiD combination. Further investigation is in progress to reveal potential immune signatures of clinical relevance. Disclosures Krevvata:  Janssen: Current Employment.
