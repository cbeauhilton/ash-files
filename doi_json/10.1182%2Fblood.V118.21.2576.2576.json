    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2576 FLT3-ITD mutations in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) are associated with early relapse after standard chemotherapy and poor survival. AC220 is a potent, selective, oral FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor that showed promising activity in FLT3-ITD+ patients (pts) in a Phase I study. This Phase II monotherapy trial was conducted to examine the safety and efficacy of AC220 monotherapy in pts with relapsed/refractory FLT3-ITD+ AML. Patients were enrolled into two cohorts: Cohort 1 enrolled pts \u226560 yrs and relapsed/refractory to 1st-line chemotherapy and Cohort 2 pts \u226518 yrs and relapsed/refractory to 2nd-line chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A planned analysis was performed in February 2011 on the first 62 pts which comprised the exploratory group with the subsequent \u223c240 pts being the confirmatory group for which the data will remain sequestered until study completion. The exploratory group was enrolled between 19 November 2009 and 25 August 2010. 53/62 (85%) pts were evaluable for efficacy (FLT3-ITD+ by central laboratory, received at least 1 dose of AC220, 1 post-tx response assessment and no major efficacy-related protocol deviations). The composite CR (CRc=CR+CRp+CRi) rate was 45% (24/53: 2 CRp, 22 CRi) and PR rate was 24% (13/53). Importantly, of the pts refractory to any prior therapy, 62% (16/26) had CRc and 19% (5/26) had PR in response to AC220. Median duration of CRc has not yet been reached in Cohort 1 and was 10.6 wks in Cohort 2. Overall, 8% (2/25) of pts in Cohort 1 and 30% (11/37) of pts in Cohort 2 underwent HSCT and were censored for duration of CRc. Median overall survival was 24.7 weeks for efficacy evaluable pts, 24.1 wks for Cohort 1 and not yet reached in Cohort 2 (pts were not censored at HSCT). At the time of the analysis 51/62 patients were off study (most commonly due to disease progression (19), HSCT (13) or adverse event (7). 55% of pts were still alive. The most common (>19%) drug-related AEs were nausea, QTc prolongation, vomiting, fatigue, dysgeusia, anorexia, febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, and dyspepsia. QTc prolongation occurred in 21 (34%) pts (Grade 3 in 11 pts, 18%). The incidence of QTc prolongation was decreased by reducing AC220 starting dose from 200 (35%) to 135 mg/day (8.3%) (males) and 90 mg/day (5.9%) (females). 15 pts (24%) experienced fatal treatment-emergent AEs; none were considered drug-related. An additional analysis will be conducted when all pts have > 1 yr follow up which will be available at the time of the meeting. These preliminary data suggest that AC220 achieves clinically meaningful reductions in marrow blasts in a substantial proportion of pts with both refractory and relapsed FLT3-ITD+ AML, and many of these pts were successfully bridged to HSCT. These encouraging efficacy results and an acceptable safety profile in this high risk population support continued clinical evaluation in mono- and combination therapy.
