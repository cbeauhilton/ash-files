    "abstract_text": "Abstract 468 The requirement for BAFF and BAFF-R in normal human and murine B cells is well studied, but there is also significant evidence to suggest that BAFF plays an important role in malignant B cell proliferation and survival. Serum BAFF levels are elevated in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and high BAFF levels correlate with aggressive disease and a poor response to therapy. There is also increasing genetic evidence suggesting an association between the development of human disease and genetic variation in genes encoding BAFF and its receptors. Mutations in TNFRSF13B (TACI) were identified in patients with familial common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and IgA deficiency and we have found that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in TNFSF13B (BAFF) are associated with elevated BAFF levels and risk for developing NHL. To build upon these findings we sequenced BAFF and its receptors; TNFSF13B , TNFRSF13B , TNFRSF17 (BCMA), and TNFRSF13C (BAFF-R) in NHL patients to identify novel genetic variants that may be associated with NHL risk. Among 40 individual samples (20 controls and 20 follicular lymphoma (FL) cases) that were bi-directionally sequenced we identified a heterozygous cytosine to thymidine transition in 1 patient specimen at position 475 (C475T) of TNFRSF13C. The C475T transition encodes a missense substitution of tyrosine for histidine in codon 159 (H159Y) in the highly conserved cytoplasmic tail of BAFF-R, adjacent to the TRAF3 binding motif PVPAT. We next expanded our analysis of BAFF-R H159Y and analyzed NHL tumor biopsies for the presence of the mutation. 4/41 (10%) follicular lymphomas (FL), 2/42 (5%) diffuse large B cell lymphomas, 1/22 (5%) lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas (LPL), and 1/24 (4%) mucosal associate lymphoid tissue lymphomas carried the heterozygous mutation. The BAFF-R H159Y mutation was not detected in any of the normal control DNA from healthy donors (n=100). Given its close proximity to the TRAF3 binding site in the cytoplasmic domain of BAFF-R we first wanted to determine if the H159Y mutation altered BAFF induced signaling. We generated cell lines that express HA-tagged wildtype BAFF-R, BAFF-R with the H159Y mutation, or BAFF-R with an ablated TRAF3 binding site as a negative control. Analysis of cells expressing H159Y BAFF-R demonstrates that this mutation results in increased BAFF-R-mediated NF\u03baB1 and NF-\u03baB2 activation. The enhanced signal activated by BAFF-R H159Y is coupled with a several fold increase in TRAF3, TRAF2, and TRAF6 recruitment to BAFF-R and increased IgM production. We further demonstrate that recruitment of TRAF6 to BAFF-R is not unique to the mutant H159Y BAFF-R, but is also an important and necessary feature of BAFF-R signaling in normal B cells. Collectively, our data identify a novel lymphoma-associated mutation in BAFF-R and describe exciting new aspects of BAFF-R signaling that are important for understanding normal B cell homeostasis and function, as well as pathogenic BAFF-R contributions to human disease.
