    "abstract_text": "The immune attack against malignant tumors requires the concerted action of CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) as well as CD4 + T helper cells. The contribution of T cell receptor (TCR)\u03b1\u03b2 + CD4 \u2212 CD8 \u2212 double-negative (DN) T cells to anti-tumor immune responses is widely unknown. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that DN T cells with a broad TCR repertoire are present in humans in the peripheral blood and the lymph nodes of healthy individuals. Here we characterize a human DN T cell clone (T4H2) recognizing an HLA-A2-restricted melanoma-associated antigenic gp100-peptide isolated from the peripheral blood of a melanoma patient. Antigen recognition by the T4H2 DN clone resulted in specific secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF. Although lacking the CD8 molecule the gp100-specifc DN T cell clone was able to confer antigen-specific cytotoxicity against gp100-loaded target cells as well as HLA-A2 + gp100 expressing melanoma cells. The cytotoxic capacity was found to be perforin/granzymeB-dependent. Together, these data indicate that functionally active antigen-specific DN T cells recognizing MHC class I-restricted tumor-associated antigen (TAA) may contribute to anti-tumor immunity in vivo ."
