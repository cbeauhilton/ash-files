    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Bosutinib is a potent SRC/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML in adults resistant or intolerant to prior therapy. This analysis evaluated the efficacy of first-line bosutinib versus imatinib in the BFORE study (NCT02130557) by 3-month BCR-ABL1 transcripts \u226410% versus >10% and examined baseline and on-treatment characteristics as predictors of time to major molecular response (MMR). Methods: In this ongoing, multinational, phase 3, open-label study, 536 patients were randomized 1:1 to bosutinib 400 mg or imatinib 400 mg once daily. The present analysis is based on \u226512 months of follow-up. Baseline and on-treatment time-dependent covariates were analyzed using a proportional subdistribution hazards model predicting time to initial MMR. No adjustment for multiple comparisons was made. Results: The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included 268 patients in the bosutinib arm and 268 patients (including 3 untreated patients) in the imatinib arm. Among evaluable patients (\u22653000 ABL1 analyzed) at 3 months in the ITT population, more patients in the bosutinib arm than in the imatinib arm had BCR-ABL1 transcripts \u226410% (80.6% of 248 patients vs 60.5% of 253 patients; P 10% at 3 months with bosutinib (117 [58.5%] vs 7 [14.6%], P <0.0001) and with imatinib (83 [54.2%] vs 14 [14.0%], P <0.0001). The cumulative MMR rates were also higher in evaluable patients with transcripts \u226410% with bosutinib (138 [69.0%] vs 12 [25%]; P <0.0001) and with imatinib (100 [65.4%] vs 30 [30.0%]; P 10% or not evaluable) at 3 months was a predictor of time to MMR in both arms ( Table ; bosutinib: hazard ratio [HR]=6.44, P <0.0001; imatinib: HR=3.69, P <0.0001). The only other predictor of time to MMR among the covariates examined was not having a bosutinib dose reduction to 300 mg due to an adverse event. Conclusion: BOS treatment was associated with a higher number of patients presenting transcripts \u226410% at 3 months than those treated with IMA. Patients with transcripts \u226410% at 3 months had higher rates of 12-month MMR and achieved response faster than those with transcripts >10%. These findings suggest that the transcript level at 3 months may be a predictor of response to first-line bosutinib and imatinib.
