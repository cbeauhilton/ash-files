    "abstract_text": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a stem cell neoplasm characterized by the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and the related oncoprotein, BCR/ABL. Despite the availability of novel BCR/ABL-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), many patients relapse which may be due to resistance of neoplastic stem cells (NSC) against TKI. So far, little is known about specific markers and targets expressed on CML NSC. We here report that CML NSC express the interleukin-2R alpha-chain CD25 in a specific (aberrant) manner. Whereas normal bone marrow (BM) stem cells were found to express only low amounts or did not express CD25, CD34 + /CD38 \u2212 NSC in CML were found to express CD25 in almost all patients examined (31/33=95%), independent of the phase of disease. CML NSC were also found to express IL-1RAP, DPPIV (CD26), Siglec-3 (CD33), Campath-1 (CD52), KIT (CD117) and IL-3RA (CD123). We were also able to show that highly purified CD25+ NSC express BCR/ABL and engraft irradiated NOD-SCID-IL-2Rg -/- (NSG) mice with BCR/ABL+ cells, whereas CD34+/CD38-/CD25-/CD26- cells from the same patients failed to express BCR/ABL, and engrafted NSG mice with BCR/ABL-negative cells. To define signalling-molecules contributing to the expression of CD25 in CML NSC, we employed primary murine hematopoietic cells infected with bcr/abl-p210 in combination with a retrovirus encoding for STAT5A or STAT5B. Enforced expression of either STAT5A or STAT5B resulted in enhanced expression of CD25 in Lin-/Sca-1+/Kit+ mouse BM stem cells (LSK cells), regardless of the presence or absence of bcr/abl. In fact, the CD25-promoting effect of STAT5 was seen in normal stem cells as well as in bcr/abl-transformed LSK cells. Correspondingly, shRNA against STAT5 was found to downregulate expression of CD25 in the human CML cell line KU812. The BCR/ABL-targeting TKI imatinib, nilotinib and ponatinib were also found to inhibit expression of CD25 on KU812 cells. In primary CML NSC, ponatinib was found to induce marked suppression of CD25, whereas imatinib and nilotinib showed only weak effects. In consecutive experiments, we found that the MEK inhibitors RDEA119 and PD032509, the STAT5-targeting drug pimozide and the dual PI3 kinase/mTOR blocker BEZ235 all inhibit 3 H-thymidine uptake and thus proliferation in KU812 cells. However, whereas RDEA119 and PD032509 as well as pimozide were found to downregulate expression of CD25 in KU812 cells, BEZ235 was found to even upregulate expression of CD25 on KU812 cells. We next applied an shRNA against CD25. The shRNA-induced knock-down of CD25 in KU812 resulted in an increased proliferative capacity, suggesting that CD25 may act as a potential tumor suppressor in CML stem- and progenitor cells. Together, our data show that CD25 is a novel functionally relevant marker-antigen and potential tumor suppressor of CML NSC. Expression of CD25 in CML cells appears to be triggered by MEK and STAT5 activity, and may be negatively regulated by the PI3 kinase/mTOR pathway. Whether modulation of CD25 can be exploited clinically and used as basis for the development of novel NSC-targeting treatment concepts in CML remains to be determined in future studies.
