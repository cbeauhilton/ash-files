    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4356 Background: Platelet inhibition by clopidogrel is highly variable. Patients with reduced inhibition have increased risk for major adverse cardiovascular events. The aim of this study was to determine whether known genetic, drug, dietary, compliance and lifestyle factors affecting clopidogrel absorption and metabolism fully account for the variability in clopidogrel pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Methods and Results: Healthy subjects (n=160; age 20\u201353; homozygous CYP2C19 extensive metabolizer genotype; no nicotine 6 weeks, prescription drugs 4 weeks, over-the-counter drugs 2 weeks, caffeine and alcohol 72 hours; confined; restricted diet) received clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 9 days. At steady-state, clopidogrel active metabolite (clopidogrel AM ) pharmacokinetics varied widely between subjects (CVs 33.8% and 40.2% for clopidogrel AM AUC t and C max , respectively). On-treatment pharmacodynamic endpoints VASP P2Y 12 platelet reactivity index (PRI), maximal platelet aggregation (MPA) to ADP, and VerifyNow P2Y12 platelet response units (PRU) also varied widely (CVs 32 \u2013 53%). All identified factors together accounted for only 18% of inter-subject variation in pharmacokinetic parameters and 32 \u2013 64% of inter-subject variation in PRI, MPA, and PRU. High on-treatment platelet reactivity was present in 45% of healthy, homozygous CYP2C19 extensive metabolizer subjects, free of nicotine, alcohol, and co-medications, with witnessed clopidogrel 75 mg/d treatment for 9 days. Conclusions: Clopidogrel pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics vary widely despite rigorous exclusion or control of known disease, polymorphisms ( CYP2C19 , CYP3A5 , ABCB1 , PON1 ), non-compliance, co-medications, diet, smoking, alcohol, demographics, and pre-treatment platelet hyperreactivity. Thus, as yet unidentified factors contribute to high on-treatment platelet reactivity with its known increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.
