    "abstract_text": "A variety of tissues can be differentiated from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in vitro through stepwise exposure to morphogens, or by conversion of one differentiated cell type into another by enforced expression of master transcription factors (TFs). Despite considerable effort, neither approach has yielded functional human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Building upon recent evidence that HSCs derive from definitive hemogenic endothelium (HE), we performed morphogen-directed differentiation of human PSCs into HE followed by screening of 26 candidate HSC-specifying TFs for the capacity to promote multi-lineage hematopoietic engraftment in irradiated immune deficient murine hosts. From genomic PCR of engrafted cells, we recovered seven TFs ( ERG, HOXA5, HOXA9, HOXA10, LCOR, RUNX1, SPI1 ) that were sufficient to convert HE into hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that engraft GLY-A+ erythrocytes, CD33+ myeloid, CD15+ CD31+ neutrophils, CD19+ IgM+ B and CD3+ T cells in primary and secondary murine recipients for 12-14 weeks. Limiting dilution analysis indicated that the frequency of repopulating cells generated by this method was 1 in 4,707-15,029, lower than the frequency in CD34+ cord blood cells (1 in 1,819-5,173). Functional characterization of terminally differentiated cells demonstrated features of definitive erythropoiesis (expression of adult beta globin and enucleation). Engrafted neutrophils responded to cytokine stimuli by activation of myeloperoxidase. Human IgM and IgG could be detected in the serum of engrafted mice, and titers of ovalbumin specific antibody increased in response to protein immunization, indicating boostable immunity. T-cells responded to PMA/Ionomycin stimuli by activation of IFN\u03b3, and sequencing of the T cell receptor revealed a broad clonotype diversity. Proviral integration analysis demonstrated derivation of myeloid and lymphoid progeny from common clones in secondary animals, indicating generation of self-renewing, multipotential HSC-like cells from PSCs. Mechanistically, the seven TFs induced HOXA target genes ( LMO2, SOX4, MEIS1 and ID2 ); upregulated expression of homing-related genes ( CXCR4, VLA5 and S1PR1 ); and enhanced the endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT), as indicated by a 2.4-fold induction of a RUNX1c -reporter. Our combined approach of morphogen-driven differentiation and TF-mediated cell fate conversion produced HSPCs from PSCs that hold promise for modeling hematopoietic disease in humanized mice and for therapeutic strategies in genetic blood disorders.
