    "abstract_text": "Increased sensitivity to inhibition of hematopoiesis by TGF-\u03b2 has been hypothesized to be a mechanism of hematopoietic failure in Fanconi Anemia (FA). To determine whether abrogation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling rescued biologic parameters of hematopoiesis, we derived a novel DKO mouse strain (SMAD3 -/- (129/Sv) Fancd2 -/- (C57BL/6)) by breeding double heterozygote mice. The DKO mice were small at birth, but achieved normalized growth and development by six - eight weeks. Hematopoiesis in long-term bone marrow cultures derived from DKO mice, ceased generating day 14 CFU-GEMM hematopoietic progenitors by 18 weeks, similar to that observed with Fancd2 -/- marrow cultures. In contrast, cultures from SMAD3 -/- (129/Sv) demonstrated continuous hematopoiesis for over 30 weeks confirming results with marrow from SMAD3 -/- (C57BL/6J) mice (Epperly, et al., Experimental Hematology, 33:353-362, 2005), and significantly longer than that in control 129/Sv X C57BL/6J F1 mouse long-term marrow cultures. Bone marrow stromal cell lines derived from long-term marrow cultures were tested for the diagnostic criterion of FA, increased sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agent, Mitomycin-C. Cells were incubated in Mitomycin-C at concentrations ranging from 0-20 ng/ml for four days and then plated in 4 well tissue culture plates, incubated for 7 days at 37 o C in a CO2 incubator, stained with crystal violet, and colonies of greater than 50 cells counted. Similar to Fancd2 -/- marrow stromal cells, DKO marrow stromal cells showed increased sensitivity to Mito-C, while marrow stromal cell lines from wild type or SMAD3 -/- mouse marrow cultures were relatively resistant (p = 0.0086 comparing Fancd2-/- to control 129/Sv X C57BL/6J F1 cells, p = 0.0156 comparing DKO with control 129/Sv X C57BL/6J F1 cells, and p = 0.4676 comparing Smad3-/- cells to control 129/Sv X C57BL/6J F1 cells). Fresh bone marrow from DKO mice, similar to that from SMAD3 -/- mice, demonstrated resistance to inhibition of hematopoietic cell colonies in vitro by increasing concentrations of TGF-\u03b2. Therefore, abrogation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in DKO cells did not alter the sensitivity of Fancd2-/- marrow stromal cells to Mitomycin-C. Supported by research grant NIAID/NIH, U19A168021.
