    "abstract_text": "Platelets are relatively short-lived, anucleated cells derived from megakaryocytes that are essential for proper hemostasis. Although they lack a nucleus, platelets possess a highly organized structure with multiple cellular organelles including mitochondria and a number of specific granules. Upon recruitment to sites of endothelial injury, platelet activation stimulates their adhesion, aggregation and release of granule components leading to coagulation. Many of the cellular changes observed during platelet activation and platelet senescence resemble those observed during apoptosis in nucleated cells, including loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase activation, phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, cell shrinkage and microparticle formation (analogous to membrane blebbing). ABT-263 is an orally bioavailable Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor currently in clinical development. This compound is a potent antagonist of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w and induces apoptosis in cancer cells dependent on these proteins for survival. ABT-263 induces a unique thrombocytopenia in multiple species that is characterized by a rapid clearance of circulating platelets with recovery to normal platelet counts within several days after treatment cessation. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this thrombocytopenia, a series of in vitro experiments were performed using freshly isolated platelets comparing ABT-263, its enantiomer (which has significantly lower activity against Bcl-2 family proteins) and known platelet activators. ABT-263, but not the enantiomer control, reduced the viability of dog and human platelets and activated key apoptotic processes, including cytochrome c release, caspase 3 activation, and PS externalization. ABT-263 did not induce aggregation of isolated platelets and did not induce surface expression of GPIIb/IIIa that is essential for platelet adhesion to fibrinogen during clot formation. While ABT-263 had no effect on markers of lysosomal- or alpha-granule release, increases in a marker of dense granule release were apparent at high concentrations. Taken together these data suggest that ABT-263 induces an apoptotic-like response in platelets that is distinct from platelet activation. Furthermore, the lack of effect of the enantiomer control compound suggests this effect is mediated through inhibition of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Loss of membrane asymmetry and PS externalization has been suggested to be the primary signal for the recognition and clearance of senescent platelets by phagocytes of the reticuloendothelial system. Induction of apoptosis in platelets by Bcl-2 family protein inhibitors such as ABT-263 may coopt this process inducing a premature platelet senescence resulting in a novel type of thrombocytopenia, in vivo .",
