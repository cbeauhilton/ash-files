    "abstract_text": "AB002 is a recombinant thrombin analog that generates endogenous activated protein C (APC) on intravascular surfaces in a thrombomodulin-dependent manner but does not promote thrombosis. Endogenously generated APC downregulates thrombin generation, thereby reducing pathological clot formation. During hemodialysis (HD), thrombi can form within the dialyzer filter and circuit, reducing dialyzer efficiency, and increasing blood loss. Heparin administration reduces clotting within the filter and circuit, but increases bleeding risk and is not tolerated in all patients. Since end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing HD are at higher risk of both thromboembolism and bleeding, a safe, short-term and self-limiting anticoagulant alternative to heparin is currently an unmet need for this population. This is a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AB002 at two dose levels when administered to ESRD patients during heparin-free HD. A total of 36 adult patients are planned to be enrolled into two cohorts and dosed sequentially. Within each cohort, patients will be randomized to active drug (12) or placebo (6). Dose levels (1.5 \u00b5g/kg or 3 \u00b5g/kg; iv infusion) were based on safety data from a completed phase 1 study performed in healthy adult subjects (NCT03453060), which demonstrated that a single dose of AB002 was well tolerated, as well as based on preclinical efficacy studies performed in a baboon vascular thrombosis model. The primary objective of this phase 2 proof-of-concept study is safety and tolerability assessed as the number and severity of adverse events (AE), changes in baseline physical and lab parameters and immunogenicity of AB002. The number and severity of AE will be tabulated and summary statistics evaluated. The secondary objectives are to assess 1) pharmacodynamics using activated protein C/protein C inhibitor complexes in plasma as a surrogate marker for drug exposure, and 2) efficacy via pre-post dialyzer pressures, visual inspection of thrombus accumulation in the HD filter and dialysis efficiency based on urea kinetics. The study population includes ESRD patients on a stable outpatient HD regimen at least 3 times per week and excludes patients with history of acute vaso-occlusive thrombotic events, concomitant use of anticoagulant/antiplatelet agents immediately prior to and during the study, active cancer and bleeding disorders. This study is currently recruiting participants at one study site (Orlando Clinical Research Center) in Orlando, FL and is estimated to complete in October 2020 (NCT03963895).
