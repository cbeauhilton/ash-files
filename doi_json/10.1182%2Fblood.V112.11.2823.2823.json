    "abstract_text": "PTLD is a heterogeneous group of neoplasms arising in patients after solid-organ or allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Although most cases of PTLD are related to Epstein - Barr virus (EBV) infection, a subset (10\u201320%) shows no association with EBV infection. Anecdotal uncontrolled studies have described EBV-negative PTLD as appearing late in the post-transplant period and having poor response to reduction of immunosuppression and poor outcome in general. We identified 30 patients who were diagnosed with EBV-negative PTLD in the University of Pennsylvania between November 1990 and April 2008. We compared the clinical and pathological characteristics, response to therapy and survival of these patients with 51 control patients matched by organ type who had EBVpositive PTLD. The average age at diagnosis was 53.1 in the EBV (\u2212) group and 49.2 in the EBV (+) group (p=NS). 3/30 (10%) of the EBV (\u2212) cases and 16/51 (31.4%) appeared within the first year after transplant (p60 were significant predictors for poor prognosis in both groups, verifying that some of the classic risk factors for lymphoid malignancies are valid in PTLD. The strongest predictor of mortality was the type of transplanted organ, where lung transplant recipients had the worst outcome and kidney transplant recipients did well (log rank p-value=0.02 for both overall survival and disease-free survival). We conclude that in our single-center series, EBV-negative PTLD is a distinct subtype which appears later in the post-transplant period. Compared with EBV-positive PTLD, it is more likely to be monomorphic and similar to common B-cell malignancies; however it still responds well to reduction of immunosuppression and specific anti-B-cell immunotherapy without compromising allograft survival. It does not necessarily require chemotherapy and can be cured similarly to EBV-positive PTLD. View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure  Close modal",
