    "abstract_text": "Background : Bleomycin-containing chemotherapy regimens have become the mainstay of treatment in Hodgkin\u2019s Disease (HD). The risk of bleomycin pulmonary toxicity (BPT) ranges from 0\u201346% and mortality rates range from 0\u201327%. Although there is no excepted standard treatment for BPT, corticosteroid treatment, withholding bleomycin from subsequent chemotherapy, and proceeding with a non-bleomycin containing regimen is the most common approach. We reviewed our experience to better delineate outcome and appropriate treatment in these patients. Methods : We reviewed all patients managed for HD at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, from January 1986 to February 2003. BPT was defined by the presence of pulmonary symptoms, bilateral interstitial infiltrates, and no evidence for an infectious etiology. Results : A retrospective review identified 141 patients with HD treated with a bleomycin-containing regimen. The mean age of patients at diagnosis was 34 years. Fifty four percent were males. The histology was nodular sclerosing in 85%. The Hasenclever index was 0 in 15%, 1 in 35%, 2 in 24%, 3 in 16%, 4 in 9%, and >5 in 1%. Frontline chemotherapy included ABVD in 57%, MOPP-ABV(D) in 33%, COPP-ABV in 8%, BEACOPP in 3%, and Stanford V in 2%. Forty one percent of patients received radiation. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) for all patients were 87% and 79% respectively. BPT was observed in 18% of patients (25/141). There was a significant decrease in OS, 63% in patients with BPT versus 90% in non-BPT patients at 5 years (p=0.0013). The mortality from BPT was 4.2% (6/141) in all patients and 24% (6/25) in patients who developed the pulmonary syndrome. These 6 patients all died within 9 months of their HD diagnosis from BPT. The Hasenclever index was 3 or less in 5 of these 6 patients. CR rates were equal at 91% and 93% in BPT and non-BPT patients respectively (p=0.299). Twenty two percent (31/141) of patients, either symptomatic or asymptomatic, had bleomycin omitted at any time from their regimen with no difference in OS or PFS, 83% versus 88% (p=0.369) and 82% versus 78% (p=0.853) respectively. The mean bleomycin dose was 84 mg/m2 (range of 20\u2013180 mg/m2). Bleomycin dose had no impact on OS or PFS. In BPT patients subsequent non-bleomycin therapy included AVD 44%, MOPP-AV 31%, or no further chemotherapy 25%. The five-year OS was equal between the AVD and MOPP-AV groups at 91%. However in patients who received no further chemotherapy 5-year OS was 30% (p=0.0001). Conclusion : Bleomycin pulmonary toxicity (BPT) results in a significant decrease in OS survival at 5 years in patients being treated for Hodgkin\u2019s Disease. In patients who do not die acutely from pulmonary toxicity both OS and PFS appear equal despite the omission of bleomycin.",
