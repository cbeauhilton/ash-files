    "abstract_text": "Deregulation of cyclin D genes is a uniform event in multiple myeloma (MM) and represent a striking addiction as observed in pan-cancer genome-wide CRISPR screening data. However, early stage Cyclin D and other cell cycle kinases inhibitors have shown a lack of single agent activity suggesting that targeting of cell cycle regulation is insufficient to produce a durable response in MM. Recent evidence recognizes the Cyclin D and CDK4 activities within the immune tumor microenvironment, supporting a previously unrecognized immunomodulatory functions of CDK4/6. This is particularly important in MM, a highly heterogeneous disease that resides in a complex ecosystem comprising of immune, endothelial, and stromal cells. We here evaluated the tumor intrinsic and extrinsic effects of CDK4/6 inhibition in MM with the goal to define rationally designed combination strategies to effectively impact MM growth. We have evaluated MM cell sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors (both Palbociclib and Abemaciclib) in a panel of 32 MM cell lines and primary MM patients' samples. As expected, both inhibitors were mostly cytostatic with G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and significant impact on the pRB-E2F axis both in vitro as well as in vivo. In luminescence subcutaneous SCID models engrafted with H929 or MM1S MM cells expressing an E2F-driven luciferase reporter, treatment with low dose Palbociclib or Abemaciclib caused regression of bulky tumors, evidenced by a ~40% reduction in tumor volume at the 14-day end-point and a decreased E2F1 reporter activity. We next studied genome-wide transcriptional response to treatment using RNA-seq analysis in two MM cell lines using multiple doses and duration (24 and 72 hours) to evaluate the effect of short and long exposure to the drug. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of RNA-seq data confirmed significant downregulation of proliferation and E2F target genes at 24 hours post treatment. Interestingly, after longer exposure to both drugs we observed modulation of signatures for Ag presentation (including upregulation of HLA-A,B, and C; B2MG), innate immune response (ICAM-1 and 2; IL-8 and several CCLs) and interferon inducible genes IFN response (IRF1, IRF9, STAT1, STAT2, STAT4, OSA1, OSA2, MX1). To confirm genomic data and evaluate if CDK4/6i promotes the induction of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) program in MM cells, we performed cytokine profile to assess the secretion of 174 soluble factors in the MM cell supernatant upon CDK4/6i. We confirmed a significant increase of chemokines involved in NK cell recruitment (CCL2, CCL4, CCL5), as well as cytokines that promote NK cell proliferation and activation. Moreover, we found that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and the NKG2D ligands ULBP2 and MICA, required for activation of NK cell cytotoxicity and tumor cell targeting, were induced after CDK4/6i in MM cells. Although not secretory per se, these NK cell ligands are part of the transcriptional module linked to the SASP. Overall, these data suggest that, in addition to a more stable cell cycle arrest, CDK4/6i may promote MM cell immune surveillance through induction of the SASP program. To further confirm the immune effects, we tested freshly isolated NK cells from MM patients and healthy donors using in vitro MM-NK cell coculture assay and observed enhanced degranulation and cytokine production (intracellular IFN-\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1) by NK cells in response to MM cells. We finally investigated the potential of combining CDK4/6i with daratumumab in a standard 4-h ADCC assays using NK cells from MM patients as effector and MM cell lines as target. Daratumumab-mediated ADCC against MM cells was significantly augmented in the combination compared to single agent. In conclusion, we here report a novel anti-MM activity of CDK4/6i which is beyond the previously reported growth arrest. The observed ability to directly modulate the immune system along with decrease in the proliferative potential of MM cells may provide opportunities to develop unique combination approaches in MM.
