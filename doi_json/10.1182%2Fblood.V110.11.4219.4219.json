    "abstract_text": "For childhood T-ALL, the significance of early differentiation markers CD34 and CD13/33 in relation to outcome is unclear. In this study of 72 pediatric T-ALL patients, CD34 and CD13/33 expression was related to a poor 5 yrs survival ( p =0.0013 for CD34 + and p =0.035 for CD33/CD13 + ). Expression of CD34 was associated with elevated MDR1 ( p =0.01) and MRP1 ( p =0.019) levels and CD13/33 + expression with MRP1 levels ( p =0.028). However, none of these MDR genes independently predicted for poor outcome. We conclude that T-ALL with CD34 and CD13/33 expression has a relatively poor survival that is not explained by expression of MDR genes."
