    "abstract_text": "Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia (WM) is characterized by bone marrow (BM) infiltration with lymphoplasmacytic cells and production of an IgM paraprotein. Lymphocytosis is uncommon in WM, and many patients exhibit peripheral B-cell lymphopenia. Recently, by whole genome sequencing, we identified a highly recurrent somatic mutation (L265P) in MYD88. Using real-time allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR), we demonstrated the presence of MYD88 L265P in 93% and 54% of patients with WM and IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), respectively (Xu et al, Blood 2013). To clarify the feasibility of using real-time AS-PCR assay to detect MYD88 L265P in peripheral blood, we first examined unselected mononuclear cells from peripheral blood (PB) samples of 88 patients with untreated WM. 81/88 (92%) of these patients were MYD88 L265P positive by bone marrow (BM) examination of CD19 selected B-cells; Of the 81 BM-MYD88 L265P positive patients, 32 (40%) demonstrated MYD88 L265P by AS-PCR in unselected PB mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained at the time of BM examination. To enhance the ability to detect MYD88 L265P in PB samples, we next used AS-PCR in CD19 selected PBMC obtained from 198 WM patients which included untreated and previously treated patients. Among untreated patients, 106/118 (89.8%) were positive for MYD88 L265P in CD19 selected PB, whereas among previously treated patients, 55/80 (68.8%) were positive for MYD88 L265P (p=0.0002 vs. untreated). Simultaneously analyzed PB and BM samples from 65 untreated WM patients demonstrated positivity for MYD88 L265P in 58/65 (89.2%) and 55/65 (84.6%) of CD19 selected BM and PB samples, respectively. These findings yielded a sensitivity of 94.8%, specificity of 100%, positive and negative predictive values of 100% and 70%, respectively for AS-PCR testing of PB CD19 + cells for MYD88 L265P in untreated WM patients. In addition, we analyzed 12 untreated IgM MGUS patients with paired sampling of CD19 selected PB and BM cells. 6/12 (50%) IgM MGUS patients were positive for MYD88 L265P in BM CD19 + cells, with 5/6 (83%) of these positive patients demonstrating MYD88 L265P by AS-PCR in CD19 selected PB samples. The overall results demonstrate a high concordance of MYD88 L265P status between PB and BM CD19 selected samples, particularly in untreated WM patients. The detection of MYD88 L265P by CD19 selected PB AS-PCR examination provides a convenient and less invasive method to support the diagnosis of WM and IgM MGUS.
