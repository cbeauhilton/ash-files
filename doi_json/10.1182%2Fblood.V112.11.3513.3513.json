    "abstract_text": "G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood has emerged as the dominant source of stem cells for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. G-CSF modulates T cell function and Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling-3 (SOCS3) is the major regulator of signaling by this cytokine, although the downstream effects in vivo remain unclear. We have therefore examined the effect of SOCS3 in the well established B6 \u2192 B6D2F1 murine model of acute GVHD directed to major histocompatibility antigens. Using SOCS3 \u2212/\u0394vav mice in which SOCS3 deficiency is restricted to the haematopoietic compartment we transplanted splenocytes from G-CSF mobilized wild-type (WT) or SOCS3 \u2212/\u0394vav donors and demonstrated that the absence of SOCS3 within the graft accelerated GVHD (median survival 23 vs. 39 days, P=0.04). By using SOCS3 \u2212/\u0394LysM and SOCS3 \u2212/\u0394lck donors in which SOCS3 deficiency was restricted to the myeloid or T cell lineage respectively we confirmed SOCS3 deficiency enhanced GVHD via effects only within the donor T cell (median survival 19 vs. 35 and 39 days in SOCS3 \u2212/\u0394lck vs. WT and SOCS3 \u2212/\u0394LysM , P<0.0001). This protective effect of SOCS3 was also seen in the absence of G-CSF mobilization since bone marrow and purified donor T cells from SOCS3 \u2212/\u0394vav donor mice significantly accelerated GVHD mortality (median survival 29 vs. 44 days, P=0.04). In mixing experiments this acceleration of GVHD was again seen only when the donor T cell was SOCS-3 deficient. SOCS3 \u2212/\u0394lck donor T cells underwent enhanced alloantigen dependent proliferation after transplantation as determined by CFSE dilution and demonstrated increased IL-10, IL-17 and IFN\u03b3 generation but reduced IL-4 secretion. In contrast no effects were seen in IL-6 and TNF secretion, or CD8 cytotoxicity against host-type targets. Consistent with the increased mortality, SOCS3 \u2212/\u0394lck donor T cells induced significantly more severe gastrointestinal GVHD as determined by semi-quantitative histopathology (GI tract scores 18 \u00b1 1.7 vs. 10.2 \u00b1 1.1, P =0.008). Blockade of the IL-10 receptor or IL-17 neutralization from the day of transplant or after the initiation of GVHD failed to attenuate the enhanced GVHD mortality induced by SOCS3 \u2212/\u0394lck donor T cells. The suppression of acute GVHD by SOCS3 is thus consistent with its ability to suppress IFN\u03b3 generation by the donor T cell, a cytokine which we have shown to be a key and direct mediator of GVHD within the GI tract ( Burman A et al, Blood  2007 : 110 : 1064 ). These studies highlight the previously unrecognized role of the SOCS3 molecule in regulating alloreactive T cell responses and suggest that the delivery of small molecule SOCS3 agonists may prove to be useful for the inhibition of Th1 dependent acute GVHD.",
