    "abstract_text": "Purpose: Splenectomy can improve the quality of life of patients with \u03b2-thalassaemia major to some extent, but also increase some unpredictable risk.In order to understand the effects of splenectomy before transplantation on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation reconstruction time, infection, graft versus host disease and hepatic veno-occlusive disease of matched sibling and unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the following studies were conducted. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 80 \u03b2-thalassaemia major patients in the southern hospital between January 2012 and December 2017 for matched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and 35 of them had a splenectomy before the transplant. Cox model adjustment, t test and \u03c72 test were used to compare the incidence of neutrophil implantation time, hemoglobin implantation time, platelet implantation time, infection, graft versus host disease and hepatic vein occlusion. Results: Neutrophilic granulocytes and platelets were implanted more rapidly in patients who underwent splenectomy than those who did not (P < 0.05).There was no significant difference in the incidence of infection, graft versus host disease and hepatic vein occlusion. Conclusion : For level of \u2161-\u2162 \u03b2-thalassaemia major patients, hypersplenism can cause delayed reconstruction of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, while before transplantation splenectomy to speed up the implantation of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and does not increase the incidence of complications after transplantation.
