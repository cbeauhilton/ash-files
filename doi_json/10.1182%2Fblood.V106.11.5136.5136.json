    "abstract_text": "Introdution: Lenalidomide (Revlimid\u2122) is Celgene\u2019s lead clinical compound in a new group of drugs called IMiDs, which have immunomodularory properties. The drug has been evaluated in phase-I, II, and III clinical trials for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Lenalidomide shows substantial anti-tumor activity in patients with refractory or relapsed MM and significantly prolongs time to tumor progression (TTP) compared to standard therapy in these patients. Lenalidomide was well tolerated in these trials, the only dose limiting toxicity in a phase-I trial was myelosuppression. In order to further improve therapeutic efficacy and to overcome drug resistance we are currently evaluating Lenalidomide (Revlimid\u2122) in combination with doxorubicin and dexamethasone (RAD) for the treatment of patients with refracrory or relapsed MM in a phase-I/II trial. Methods: Patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma recieve a fixed dose of either 10 mg or 15 mg Revlimid Revlimid\u2122 given daily for 21 days (d 1\u201321) in combination with doxorubicin (adriamycin) and dexamethasone, to be repeated on day 29. Three dose levels of doxorubicin (adramycin) are planned: 4 mg/m 2 day 1\u20134, 6 mg/m 2 day 1\u20134 and 9 mg/m 2 day 1\u20134. 40 mg dexamethasone is given orally day 1\u20134 and day 17\u201320 at a fixed dose. 3\u2013 6 cycles are applicated unless severe toxicity or disease progression occurs. Results: RAD treatment was well tolerated at dose level 1 and dose level 2. Therefore, current dose escalation is continued. All patients treated at the first two dose levels (6/6) responded to RAD treatment. Further updated results on this trial will be presented.",
