    "abstract_text": "Recent advances in understanding the major bottlenecks in derivation of engraftable HSCs and lymphoid cells from pluripotent stem cells (PSC), have identified deficiencies in NOTCH and HOXA signaling as contributing factors to the observed functional deficits of PSC-derived hematopoietic progenitors. However, little is known about the mechanisms that are essential for establishing these pathways during PSC differentiation. Here, we revealed the critical role of SOX17 in linking HOXA and NOTCH-mediated arterial programs in hemogenic endothelium (HE) and specification of definitive lympho-myeloid hematopoiesis. Using SOX17-knockout (SOX17 -/- ) and SOX17 DOX-inducible (iSOX17) hESCs, we found that SOX17-deficiency substantially reduces formation of CD144 + CD43 - CD73 - DLL4 + CXCR4 +/- arterial HE and definitive lympho-myeloid hematopoiesis, while SOX17 upregulation at mesodermal stage of development causes the opposite effect. Molecular profiling of HE generated from iSOX17 hESCs in DOX+ and DOX- conditions using RNAseq, SOX17 ChIPseq and ATACseq, revealed that SOX17 overexpression upregulates 522 genes enriched in NOTCH, TGFb, HEDGEHOG and WNT signaling, including DLL1, DLL4, NOTCH4, LFNG, WNT5a, WNT5b, GLI3, and genes associated with HSC development, CXCR4, KITLG and ALDH1A2 . In addition, we noted significant upregulation of HOXA7, HOXA9 , HOXA10, HOXB8, HOXC4 and CDX2 homeobox genes in SOX17-induced cultures, with no expression of HOXA genes observed in HE from SOX17 -/- cells. ChIPSeq analysis revealed DOX+ specific SOX17 binding at transcriptional start sites (TSS) of 316 significantly upregulated genes, including ALDH1A2, CDX2, DLL1, DLL4, HEY1, HOXA7, HOXB8, HOXC4 and KITLG, suggesting that upregulation of these genes could be explained by their direct activation by SOX17. Since ALDH1A2 and CDX2 are known to play a role in the activation of HOXA genes, we investigated whether SOX17's effect on HOXA expression could also be mediated by ALDH1A2 and CDX2. We found that adding ALDH1 inhibitor to DOX+ cultures had no effect on arterial HE development and HOXA expression. In contrast, transfection of iSOX17 hPSCs cultures with CDX2 shRNA significantly decreased arterial HE formation and downregulated HOXA7, HOXA9, and HOXA10 expression. Overall, our studies indicate that SOX17 plays a critical role in the activation and integration of arterial and HOXA programs in HE, which is mediated by CDX2. These findings will be important for designing a strategy for direct HSC fate programming from hPSCs. Disclosures Uenishi: Casebia Therapeutics: Employment.
