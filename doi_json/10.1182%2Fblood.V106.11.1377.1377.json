    "abstract_text": "The identification of LSC has important implications for future research as well as for the development of novel therapies. The phenotypic description of LSC now enables their purification and should facilitate the identification of genes that are preferentially expressed in these cells compared to normal HSC. However, gene-expression profiling is usually conducted on mononuclear cells of AML patients from either peripheral blood and/or bone marrow. These samples contain a mixture of blasts cells, normal hematopoietic cells and limited number of leukemic stem cells. Thus, this results in a composite profile that obscure differences between LSC and blasts cells with low proliferative potential. The aim of this study was to compare the gene expression profile of highly purified LSC versus leukemic blasts in order to identify genes that might have important roles in driving the leukemia. For this purpose, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of highly purified LSCs (Lin\u2212CD34+CD38\u2212) and more mature blast cells (Lin\u2212CD34+CD38+) isolated from 7 adult AML patients. All samples were previously tested for the ability of the Lin\u2212CD34+CD38\u2212 cells but not the Lin\u2212CD34+CD38+ fraction to engraft using the non-obese diabetic/severe combined immuno-deficiency (NOD-SCID) repopulation assay. Affymetrix microarrays (U133A chip), containing 22,283 genes, were used for the analysis. Comparison of Lin-CD34+CD38- cell population to the Lin\u2212CD34+CD38+ cell fraction showed 5421 genes to be expressed in both fractions. Comparative analysis of gene-expression profiles showed statistically significant differential expression of 133 genes between the 2 cell populations. Most of the genes were downregulated in the LSC-enriched fraction, compared to the more differentiated fraction. Gene ontology was used to determine the categories of the up-regulated transcripts. These transcripts, which are selectively expressed, include a number of known genes (e.g., receptors, signalling genes, proliferation and cell cycle genes and transcription factors). These genes play important roles in differentiation, self-renewal, migration and adhesion of HSCs. Among the genes showing the highest differences in expression levels were the following: ribonucleotide reductase M2 polypeptide, thymidylate synthetase, ZW10 interactor, cathepsin G, azurocidin 1, topoisomerase II, CDC20, nucleolar and spindle associated protein 1, Rac GTPase activating protein 1, leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, myeloperoxidase, cyclin A1 (RRM2, TYMS, ZWINT, CTSG, AZU1, TOP2A, CDC20, NUSAP1, RACGAP1, LILRB2, PCNA, MPO, CCNA1). Some transcripts detected have not been implicated in HSC functions, and others have unknown function so far. This work identifies new genes that might play a role in leukemogenesis and cancer stem cells. It also leads to a better description and understanding of the molecular phenotypes of these 2 cell populations. Hence, in addition to being a more efficient way to further understand the biology of LSC, this should also provide a more efficient way of identifying new therapeutics and diagnostic targets.",
