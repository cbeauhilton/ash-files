    "abstract_text": "With increasing understanding of the genetic basis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), more targeted therapies have been developed. However, most of these therapies have activities only against a subset of DLBCL, activated B-cell like subtype (ABC), in particular, where the BCR pathway is known to be chronically active. Specific single-molecule directed therapies, although effective, often induce resistance over long term treatment. Agents with broader activities are needed for the treatment of this heterogeneous disease. Since both the BCR and JAK/STAT pathways are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of DLBCL, in the present study, we evaluated the anti-lymphoma activity of PRT062070 (PRT2070), a novel compound that dually targets both JAK and SYK signaling pathways. We analyzed a panel of DLBCL cells lines, of both ABC and germinal center B-cell like (GCB) subtypes, as well as DLBCL patient samples, for cellular and molecular events affected by PRT2070. Immunoblotting analyses showed that ABC and GCB subtype of DLBCL cells exhibit different JAK/STAT and BCR signaling profiles. For instance, AKT was highly expressed in GCB cells, whereas STAT3 was more strongly expressed in ABC cells. In GCB cell lines, PRT2070 blocked G 1 /S transition and caused cell cycle arrest. In contrast, in ABC cells, the drug induced apoptosis and down-regulated MCL1 protein. Furthermore, array of PRT2070-treated ABC subtype of DLBCL cells revealed that several STAT3 regulated cytokines and chemokines, including IL10, were down-regulated, confirming that PRT2070 affects ABC-DLBCL cells via JAK/STAT pathway. Genetic knockdown of both JAK and SYK reduced the growth and the survival of DLBCL cells more pronouncedly than knockdown of JAK or SYK alone, suggesting the anti-tumor activity of PRT2070 was mediated by dual inhibition of JAK and SYK signaling pathways. Importantly, JAK/STAT and BCR signaling can be blocked by PRT2070 in GCB and non-GCB primary human DLBCL cells, which led to death of these cells. Our work provided mechanistic insights into the actions of JAK/SYK dual inhibitor PRT2070 suggesting that the drug may be a potent treatment of DLBCL with a broader anti-tumor activity in both ABC and GCB subtypes of the lymphoma.
