    "abstract_text": "Abstract 7 Notch signaling is activated in \u223c70% of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) samples and many human and mouse T-ALL cell lines require Notch signals for growth and survival. To gain insight into the role of Notch during induction of T-ALL, we used a fully penetrant, conditional, transgenic Kras G12D mouse model in which \u223c80% of T-ALLs acquire activating Notch1 mutations in the endogenous locus. We crossed mice bearing this transgene with Rosa26-DNMAML f/f mice, which conditionally express the pan-Notch inhibitor DNMAML. T-ALL developed in these mice despite the expression of DNMAML throughout T-cell development. \u223c75% of T-ALL tumors acquired activating Notch1 mutations and suppressed expression of DNMAML, which is consistent with frequent \u201cescape\u201d of Notch from inhibition for efficient T-ALL development. We next compared T-ALL cells that lacked DNMAML expression with T-ALL cells that continued to express DNMAML. T-ALL cells lacking DNMAML expressed the direct Notch target c-Myc at higher levels, proliferated at a higher rate, and contained \u223c10-fold higher levels of leukemia-initiating cells. Moreover, DNMAML-positive T-ALLs lost DNMAML after transfer into secondary recipients. These data underscore the strong selective pressure for Notch signals during generation and maintenance of T-ALL. We next sought a mechanistic answer for the strong selective pressure for Notch activation. c-Myc and Akt have both been posited to be critical targets of oncogenic Notch signals. To compare the relative contributions of c-Myc and Akt to lymphomagenesis, we overexpressed c-Myc and activated AKT in the Kras G12D -driven mouse model. T-ALLs induced by Kras G12D and Akt acquired activating Notch1 mutations in \u223c70% of tumors, which were sensitive to Notch inhibitors (gamma-secretase inhibitors [GSI]). In contrast, T-ALLs induced by Kras G12D and c-Myc did not acquire Notch1 mutations and were resistant to GSI. We conclude that upregulation of c-Myc is sufficient to substitute for Notch in lymphomagenesis, whereas activation of Akt signaling is not. These data identify c-Myc not AKT as the driving force behind Notch-induced lymphomagenesis. These data emphasize the Notch/c-Myc axis as an attractive, rational, therapeutic target in T-ALL.
