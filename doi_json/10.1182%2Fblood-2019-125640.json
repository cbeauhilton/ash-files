    "abstract_text": "Background. Despite the improvement of therapeutic regimens, a relevant proportion of multiple myeloma (MM) patients (pts) experience early relapse (ER) [Majithia, Leukemia 2016] and represents an unmet medical need. It is therefore of high clinical interest to identify baseline factors that may predict ER. Aims To design models predictive of ER (defined as pts with a time-to-progression \u226418 or \u2264 24 months). To assess the accuracy of every model on an independent validation set. To build a score to predict ER. Methods Data were obtained from 2326 pts enrolled in 8 multi-center clinical trials: NCT01093196, NCT01346787, NCT01857115, NCT01190787, NCT00551928, NCT01091831, NCT01063179 and 2005-004730-41. Here, we included 14 baseline features (fts): age, creatinine, albumin (alb), b2microglobulin (b2m), bone marrow plasma cell (PCbm) were evaluated as continuous variables; free light chain (FLC, \u03bb vs K), M-component subtype (IgA vs others), Revised International Staging System (R-ISS stage II/III vs I), lactate dehydrogenase levels >/\u2264 upper limit of normal (LDHULN), presence vs absence of chromosomal abnormalities detected by FISH [del17p, t(4;14), t(14;16), t(11;14)], and presence of plasmacytomas as categorical values. Trials were assigned to training and validation set to have a superimposed median (\u03bce) age and follow-up in the two subsets. From the training set, a univariate analysis (UV) on outcome was performed according to both Chi-square and Kruskal tests, as appropriate. Features with p<0.05 were then tested in a multivariate (MV) logistic regression model. Each MV model was based on pts with complete data available. We performed and compared 2 MV models, one including R-ISS and one including fts (LDHULN, alb, b2m and chromosomal abnormalities) defining the R-ISS considered individually. Secondly, each model was tested on the validation set assessing the area under the curve (AUC). From the most accurate model, a score defined low (L), intermediate (I) and high (H) chances of ER. Statistical analysis was performed via R (v.3.5.2). Results ER\u226418 models . 10/14 fts were selected based on UV analysis: age, FLC, PCbm, del17p, t(4/14), t(14/16), alb and b2m, LDHULN and R-ISS stage. Pts with complete data were included in the training set (n=923; \u03bce age =66 years [y]; ER=35%) and the validation set (n=313; \u03bce age=67 y; ER=36%), respectively. In the MV incorporating the R-ISS, the R-ISS II/III vs I (OR=1.75, 95% CI:1.26-2.44) and increased PCbm (OR=1.05, 95% CI:1.02-1.08) increased the risk of ER. When the MV analysis was performed including single fts instead of R-ISS, increased PCbm (OR=1.05, 95% CI:1.02-1.08), \u03bb FLC (OR=1.34, 95% CI:1.01-1.79), LDHULN (OR=1.80, 95% CI:1.16-2.81), presence of both del17q (OR=1.58, 95% CI:1.07-2.33) and t(4/14) (OR=2.01, 95% CI:1.36-3.01) increased the probability of ER; increased alb (OR=0.75, 95% CI:0.61-0.94), reduced the risk of ER (table 1). ER\u226424 models . 8/14 fts were selected based on UV analysis: FLC, PCbm, del17p, t(4/14), alb and b2m levels, LDHULN and R-ISS stage. Pts with complete data were included in the training set (n=1009; \u03bce age=67 y; ER=45%) and in the validation set (n=352; \u03bce age=67 y, ER=45%). In MV analysis, including R-ISS, both R-ISS (OR=1.88, 95% CI:1.39-2.55) and PCbm (OR=1.04, 95% CI:1.02-1.06) impacted on outcome. When the MV analysis was performed including single fts, \u03bb FLC (OR=1.31, 95% CI:1.01-1.69), PCbm (OR=1.04, 95% CI:1.02-1.07), del17p (OR=1.86, 95% CI:1.30-2.65) and t(4/14) (OR=2.00, 95% CI:1.38-2.88) retained their impact on outcome (table 1). Validation. Each MV model was tested on the validation set. Among the 4 MV models, the ER\u226418 incorporating individual fts resulted in the highest AUC (0.66) and was therefore used to build up a prognostic score. Score. The ER score was calculated as 0.047 \u00d7 PCbm + 0.589 \u00d7 LDHULN + 0.459 \u00d7 del17q (IF present) + 0.705 \u00d7 t(4/14) (IF present) + 0.293 \u00d7 FLC (IF FLC =\u03bb) - 0.284 \u00d7 alb. The ER score was calculated as 3 groups of pts with different risks of ER: L (42% of pts; risk of ER18=23%), M (33% of pts; risk of ER18=39%) and H (26% of pts; risk of ER18 =55%). Discussion . This is the first analysis proposing a score that includes standard baseline fts and aims at identifying pts at high risk of ER in the context of novel agent-based therapy. Based on our score, 26% of pts can be defined at high risk. To improve the clinical applicability, the construction of a simplified model with categorized variables is ongoing.
