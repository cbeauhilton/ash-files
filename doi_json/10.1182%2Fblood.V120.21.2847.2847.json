    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2847 Background and Purpose: Myelofibrosis (MF) is a progressive Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by debilitating symptoms, massive splenomegaly, and anemia, which severely impairs quality of life. When medical therapy is not effective or tolerated, splenectomy may be required to ease symptoms in patients with symptomatic portal hypertension, massive splenomegaly, and/or frequent red blood cell transfusions (Barbui et al. J Clin Oncol. 2011;29:761\u2013770). In a recent study (Tefferi et al. Mayo Clin Proc. 2012;87:25\u201333) up to 27% of patients diagnosed with MF eventually underwent splenectomy. However, splenectomy is associated with limited duration of symptom response, high rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality, and acceleration of hepatomegaly. Clinical studies in patients with MF have demonstrated that ruxolitinib, an oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, provides significant and durable reductions in splenomegaly, the burden of MF-associated symptoms, and also improved quality of life. In this post hoc analysis of pooled data from these studies, we determined the incidence of splenectomy in patients treated with ruxolitinib and those who received placebo or best available therapy (BAT) to evaluate whether ruxolitinib therapy may affect the need for splenectomy. Methods: This analysis included patients who participated in the ruxolitinib phase I/II trial (N=153; Verstovsek et al. N Engl J Med . 2010;363:1117\u20131127); COMFORT-I, a phase III, 24-month placebo-controlled trial of ruxolitinib (N=309; Verstovsek et al. N Engl J Med. 2012;366:799\u2013807); and COMFORT-II, a phase III, 48-month randomized trial comparing the effects of ruxolitinib and BAT (N=219; Harrison et al. N Engl J Med . 2012;366:787\u2013798). Incidence of splenectomy while on treatment or during the protocol-specified follow-up period, adjusted for differences in the duration of follow up, was calculated for patients on ruxolitinib, placebo, or BAT. Results: As a result of the crossover rules and a higher discontinuation rate on the comparator arms in the phase III studies, mean follow-up duration for placebo (0.67 years) or BAT (0.95 years) overall was substantially shorter than mean follow-up duration for ruxolitinib (1.78 years). Baseline characteristics of the 14 patients who underwent splenectomy were as follows: median age=63 years; median time since initial diagnosis=7.8 years; median spleen length (n=13): 17.0 cm (range: 0\u201328.0 cm); median spleen volume (in those with measurement, n=11)=2924 cm 3 (range: 1203\u20136807 cm 3 ); IPSS high risk=50%, intermediate-2 risk=43%, intermediate-1=7%. Among patients originally randomized and treated with ruxolitinib, the incidence of splenectomy was 1.1 events per 100 patient years (Table). For patients treated with placebo or BAT in the phase III studies, the incidence of splenectomy was approximately three times higher at 2.9 events per 100 patient years, despite the fact that patients on placebo or BAT were allowed to crossover to ruxolitinib if they had worsening symptomatic splenomegaly. Conclusions: Although limited by small numbers, results of this analysis suggest that ruxolitinib reduces the need for splenectomy in patients with MF. Because of crossover to ruxolitinib and higher discontinuation rates in placebo and BAT, follow-up duration was shorter in these treatment arms compared with ruxolitinib. Further, ruxolitinib treatment in crossover patients may have prevented progression of symptomatic splenomegaly in some patients who may have otherwise become candidates for splenectomy. Our analysis may underestimate the true incidence of splenectomy among patients not receiving ruxolitinib therapy and therefore, the relative reduction in splenectomy rate in patients receiving this therapy. Longer-term follow up will better define the splenectomy rate in ruxolitinib-treated patients. Table: Incidence of Splenectomy During Clinical Studies of Ruxolitinib  Patient group . Patients, n .
