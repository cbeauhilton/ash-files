    "abstract_text": "AVID200 is an engineered TGF-\u03b2 ligand trap comprised of TGF-\u03b2 receptor ectodomains fused to a human Fc domain. AVID200 has antibody-like properties and is 1,000 times more selective for neutralizing TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b23 (pM potency), compared to TGF-b2. Since TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b23 are negative regulators of hematopoiesis, while TGF-b2 is a positive regulator of hematopoiesis, the unique isoform selectivity profile of AVID200 makes it an attractive agent for the treatment of Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) associated anemia. As TGF-\u03b22 is implicated in normal cardiovascular function and tumor cell dormancy, the specificity profile of AVID200 also minimizes the potential for cardiotoxicity and promotion of metastasis, which have been observed with pan-neutralizing TGF- \u03b2 agents. MDS consist of a group of disorders that lead to cytopenia through ineffective hematopoiesis. One critical factor that is commonly associated with the occurrence of these disorders is the pathological overproduction of TGF-\u03b2. Increased TGF-\u03b2 results in the arrest of myeloprogenitor cells preventing hematopoiesis. This disruption of the differentiation program and resulting cytopenia can lead to development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in one-third of MDS patients. A critical feature of MDS is an increased level of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) activity, a low fidelity form of DNA damage repair, as compared to high-fidelity homologous recombination (HR) repair. The increased level of NHEJ repair in MDS cells results in a hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents such as mitomycin C (MMC). Previously, in a model of MDS, treatment with TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors was shown to restore the ratio of NHEJ:HR repair to normal, resulting in more accurate DNA repair. Therefore, the effect of increased TGF-\u03b2 in patients with MDS is deleterious in two ways. First, elevated levels of TGF-\u03b2 suppress erythropoiesis leading to anemia. Second, the shift from HR to NHEJ allows for less precise DNA repair and the development of mutations which could result in AML formation. Using a TGF-\u03b2 responsive AML line, we have shown that AVID200 prevents the growth inhibition induced by TGF-\u03b21. Additionally, AVID200 reversed the hypersensitivity to MMC, implying an improvement in DNA damage repair. Currently, we are investigating the effectiveness of treating two MDS cell lines (MDS-92 and MDS-L) with AVID200 to determine its ability to not only prevent the growth inhibition associated with TGF-\u03b21, but also to enhance DNA damage repair. The safety of AVID200 has been evaluated in several preclinical models. In a chick embryo model of metastasis, AVID200 did not promote the growth of metastatic foci, whereas a pan-neutralizing TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor did. This result is important since a significant percentage of patients with MDS go on to develop AML and other cancers. The cardiac safety of AVID200 was evaluated in a single-dose pilot non-human primate study. No adverse cardiovascular events were observed at doses of up to 30 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. These results indicate that AVID200 is a promising new agent for the safe and effective treatment for MDS associated anemia.
