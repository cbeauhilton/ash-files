    "abstract_text": "The immunologically hostile microenvironment of MM contributes to the limited success of immunotherapy strategies. In addition to direct tumour-induced immunosuppression, tumour cells may generate suppressor cells such as T reg cells which can profoundly suppress immune responses and induce tolerance. This study aimed to determine if T reg subsets are increased in the peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) of patients with MGUS/MM and how this correlates with increasing disease burden. PB samples from 166 patients with MGUS/MM (Newly diagnosed (ND), n=34; Plateau/low disease burden (LD), n=63; Relapsed/refractory (R/R), n=27 and MGUS, n=42) with a median age of 69 years (range 39\u201389 yrs) were analysed by FACS and compared to PB from 32 age/sex matched controls. Using a sequential gating strategy, naturally occurring T reg cells (nT regs ) were identified as CD4 + /CD25 + / FoxP3 + T-cells and expressed as a percentage of the CD4 + T-cells. Double negative T cells (DN T regs ) were identified as CD3 + /CD4 \u2212 /CD8 \u2212 /alphabeta-TCR + /gammadelta \u2212 TCR \u2212 and expressed as a percentage of the CD3 + cells. Sera were analysed by ELISA for IL10 and TGF-beta. nT Reg cells were significantly increased in patients with MGUS/MM compared with controls (Controls 1.6% \u00b1 0.2, MGUS 2.3% \u00b1 0.3, ND 2.4% \u00b1 0.2, LD 4.2% \u00b1 0.7 & R/R 3.8% \u00b1 0.5; p=0.003). There was a positive correlation of nT Regs number with paraprotein level (R=0.3, p=0.005). Patients on Thalidomide at the time of sample collection had significantly higher numbers of nT Regs of 6% in comparison to patients who never received Thalidomide (3%) and patients who previously received the drug (3.5%, p=0.005). Analysis of BM (n=12) demonstrated a significantly reduced number of nT Regs in comparison to PB (1.6% vs 3.0%, p=0.025), which is higher than the number of nT Regs in the BM of controls (0.7%). Functionally, nT Regs from patients demonstrated suppressive activity of both autologous and allogeneic T-cells similar to nT Regs cells from control PB (p=NS). In contrast, DN T Regs were significantly reduced in patients with myeloma (ND 1.0% \u00b1 0.2, LD 1.1% \u00b1 0.1, R/R 1.3% \u00b1 0.2) compared with MGUS and controls (2.1% \u00b1 0.9 & 3.3% \u00b1 0.7, respectively; p=0.02). Serum IL10 levels were significantly lower in ND (17 \u00b1 38 pg/ml) and LD (29 \u00b1 36 pg/ml) than in Controls (55 \u00b1 89 pg/ml), MGUS (72 \u00b1 151 pg/ml) and R/R (90 \u00b1182 pg/ml, p=0.02). TGF-b levels differed significantly between groups (Controls 3765 \u00b1 1593 pg/ml, MGUS 3506 \u00b1 1504 pg/ml, ND 4774 \u00b1 9879 pg/ml, LD 1915 \u00b1 1324 pg/ml, R/R 2802 \u00b1 2011 pg/ml, p=0.025). These results provide further evidence of immune dysregulation in MM. The association with advanced disease stage suggests a causal association.",
