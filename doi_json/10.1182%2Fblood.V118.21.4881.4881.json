    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4881 We have recently shown that NB4,an APL cell line, is dependent on glycolysis, while THP-1, a monocytic cell line, is relatively dependent on oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, where oxidation of fatty acid is important. (Leukemia and Lymphoma 51:2112,2010) Here, we examined the energy metabolism of these leukemia cell lines in immunodeficient mice. 1.0\u00d710 7 cells of each cell line were inoculated subcutaneously in NOD/scid mice with the treatment of anti-asialo GM1 antibody. Mice were divided into two groups: normal diet (carbohydrate;65.3%, fat;6.3%) or carbohydrate-restricted (high fat) diet (carbohydrate;19.6%, fat;62.2%). At day 42, tumor volume (TV) of NB4 in three normal diet-fed mice became 694\u00b1358mm 3 , which was greater than that in three high fat diet-fed mice:173\u00b1216mm 3 (P= 0.043). On the other hand, tumor volume of THP-1 in three normal diet-fed mice became 1130 \u00b1 600mm 3 , which was smaller than that in three high fat diet-fed mice: 3300 \u00b1 1053mm 3 (p = 0.050). Then, since 14 days after inoculation of leukemia cells in NOD/scid mice fed with normal diet, glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) (35mg/mouse) was administered intraperitoneally once a week. Tumor size at day 41 of both leukemia cells were suppressed by 2-DG treatment. (THP-1: 2-DG (-): TV = 3099 \u00b1 193mm 3 , 2-DG (+): TV = 513 \u00b1 550mm 3 ) (THP-1: p = 0.040). (NB4: 2-DG (-): TV = 495 \u00b1 417mm 3 , 2-DG (+): TV = 87 \u00b1 89mm 3 ) (NB4: p = 0.313). Pathological examination of tumors have shown that 2-DG treated tumor had larger areas of dead cells in both cell lines. Our study demonstrated that NB4 is dependent largely on glucose and THP-1 on fat. In addition, 2-DG is effective in growth suppression of leukemia cells in vivo. These findings will help the future therapy for leukemia targeting energy metabolism. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
