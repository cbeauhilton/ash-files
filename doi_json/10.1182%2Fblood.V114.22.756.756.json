    "abstract_text": "Abstract 756 Background: Myelofibrosis (MF) is the most serious of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) for which there is no approved therapy. Exaggerated JAK2 signaling, either by gain-of-function mutations (eg, JAK2V617F) or high circulating levels of JAK1/2 activating cytokines (eg, interleukin [IL]-6), is believed to play a key role in MPN pathogenesis. INCB018424 (424), a selective oral inhibitor of JAK1/2, has demonstrated clinical benefits including reduction of splenomegaly and improvement of symptoms in a Phase I/II trial in MF patients. Thrombocytopenia was identified as the dose limiting toxicity occurring in 30% of patients at 25mg BID. Methods: Patients with primary, post-PV or post-ET MF were enrolled in the study. Following the characterization of multiple dosing regimens, an individually optimized dose regimen strategy was developed, based on available efficacy and safety data. In a subset of patients, spleen volume change was measured by MRI at 1, 3 and 6 months of treatment in order to establish an objective measure of spleen response. The impact of 424 on MF associated symptoms was assessed using a validated instrument, MFSAF (Mesa et al., Leukemia Research 2009). As a surrogate marker of functional benefit, exercise capacity was assessed with a standardized 6-minute walk test (6MWT) at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months of therapy. Results: 155 patients were enrolled in the study, with median duration of treatment of 1+ years and the duration of drug exposure of >150 patient years (76 patients received >1 year of therapy). Clinical responses have been maintained over the entire duration of treatment and most patients remain on therapy (115 of 155 patients; 74%). Progression to AML occurred in 3 patients, which is below the expected frequency based on published data (Barosi et al., Blood 2007). SAEs related to 424 occurred in 12 patients, and are generally related to bone marrow suppression or return of or exacerbation of signs and symptoms of MF when therapy is discontinued. Further optimization of the dosing regimen utilized baseline platelet count to determine the starting dose (10 or 15mg BID) and allowed dose titration after 1 and 2 months of therapy; most patients were optimized to 15 or 20mg BID. This approach significantly reduced the incidence of thrombocytopenia (<5%, N=35), while providing equivalent efficacy to higher dose regimens. With an optimized dosing regimen, spleen volume reduction was evident as early as 1 month, and durable over 6 months, of therapy (33 % median decrease after 6 months, N=23). Eleven of 23 (48%) of patients achieved \u2265 35% reduction (equivalent to IWG clinical improvement criteria of 50% reduction by palpation) from baseline in spleen volume at month 6. MF patients have impaired exercise capacity at baseline (decreased 6MWT performance by 60-90 meters vs. age-matched controls). Treatment with 424 resulted in improved 6MWT performance, with median increase from baseline of 33, 58 and 70 meters after 1,3 or 6 months of therapy, respectively. Rapid and durable reduction of a total symptom score based on key symptoms (fatigue, abdominal discomfort/pain, bone/muscle pain, night sweats and pruritus) was noted (51 % and 58% of patients achieving 50% reduction in the total score following 1 and 6 months of treatment, respectively). Improvement in symptoms coincided with a rapid and sustained reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1b, IL-1ra, IL-6 and TNFa, without tachyphylaxis to therapy. Finally, spleen response was associated with greater improvements in total symptom score, exercise capacity, and reduced fatigue (see Table ).  Parameter . Non-Responder . Moderate Responder a .

Safety and efficacy of 424 in MF patients is further supported by the follow-up data of >1 yr of 424 therapy. Disclosures: Verstovsek: Incyte: Research Funding.
