    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2908 Objectives This study was to detect if there were abnormalities of membrane hemopoietic cytokine receptor expression on CD34 + bone marrow cells in MDS. Methods 34 newly diagnosed MDS(12 in low-risk and 22 in high-risk) cases and 32 normal controls were enrolled in this study. Their CD34 + CD38 + and CD34 + CD38 - bone marrow cells and the expressions of stem cell factor receptor(SCF-R),erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) and thrombopoietin receptor (TpoR) on those cells were measured by flow cytometry. Results The mean percentage of CD34 + BMMNCs of MDS cases in high risk[(2.94\u00b14.79)%)] was significantly higher than that of control group[(0.95\u00b11.06)%]( P <0.05). The mean percentages of CD34 + CD38 + cells were significantly lower in low risk and high risk groups[(86.98\u00b16.83)% and (83.57\u00b19.86)% respectively] than that in control group [(92.41\u00b13.43)%], thus the percentage of CD34 + CD38 - cells was significantly higher in either low-risk or high-risk group[(13.03\u00b16.84)% and (16.42\u00b19.85)% respectively]than that in control group[(7.59\u00b13.43)%]( P <0.05). In control group, the mean percentage of antigen expression of EpoR was significantly lower in CD34 + CD38 + cells [(17.72\u00b120.24) %] than that in CD34 + CD38 - cells [(64.65\u00b121.02)%]( P <0.01), The expressions of SCF-R,G-CSFR and TpoR on CD34 + CD38 - cells were not significantly different from these on CD34 + CD38 + cells. The expression of EpoR on CD34 + CD38 + cells of low-risk and high-risk MDS groups[(7.01\u00b16.82)% and (7.16\u00b19.45)% respectively] were significantly lower than that of control group[(17.72\u00b120. 24) %] ( P <0.05), The expression of G-CSFR on CD34 + CD38 + cells of low-risk and high-risk MDS groups[(22.65\u00b112.14)% and (26.50\u00b119.65)% respectively] were significantly lower than that of control group[(45.13\u00b123.41)%]( P <0.01). The amount of EpoR on CD34 + CD38 - cells of low-risk and high-risk MDS groups[(40.18\u00b120.38)% and (28.58\u00b117.00)% respectively] were significantly lower than that of control group[(64.65\u00b121.02)%]( P <0.01), The expression of TpoR on CD34 + CD38 - cells of low-risk and high-risk MDS groups[(4.46\u00b17.45)% and (3.23\u00b14.55)% respectively] were significantly lower than that of control group[(15.33\u00b114.95)%]( P <0.01). The incidence of cytopenia of MDS cases with low expression rates of hemopoietic cytokine receptors on CD34 + cells were higher than that of MDS with high expression rates of hemopoietic cytokine receptors. Conclusions There were abnormalities of differentiation and membrane hemopoietic cytokine receptors expression of CD34 + bone marrow cells in MDS, which were associated with MDS cytopenia and might be useful for MDS diagnosis.
