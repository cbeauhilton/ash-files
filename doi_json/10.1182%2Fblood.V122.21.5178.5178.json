    "abstract_text": "Background Patients who develop severe thrombocytopenia while treated with TK inhibitors may be forced to stop them, face a worse prognosis, and eventually require a treatment with a bone marrow transplant. Eltrombopag is a TPO receptor agonist that stimulates megakaryocytic proliferation. Case 62-year-old man presented in October 2008 with splenomegaly and leukocytosis. The bone marrow biopsy was diagnostic of CML. Imatinib was started at 400 mg daily resulting in hematological response and resolution of splenomegaly, but severe thrombocytopenia necessitated 50 % dose reduction. Thrombocytopenia was not responsive to Prednisone, and a trial of platelets transfusions with the standard dose of Imatinib had to be stopped because of thrombocytopenia below 10 K and the risk of bleeding \u2013 reducing the dose of the TKI was improving the platelet count. Treatment with Dasatinib and with Nilotinib also necessitated 50 % dose reductions because of thrombocytopenia. These reduced TKI dosing resulted in the best Quantitative RT-PCR for bcr/abl product reduction level at \u2013 1.01. Bone marrow biopsy in December 2010 showed no morphologic evidence of CML, and no dysplasia; it was normocellular marrow with erythroid hyperplasia and megakaryocytic hypoplasia. Cytogenetic analysis and FISH showed presence of the Philadelphia chromosome rearrangement. The patient declined the treatment with a Bone marrow transplant. In April 2011 a TPO agonist Eltrombopag 50 mg daily was started, given on two weeks on two weeks off schedule. As platelets remained adequate since then, the Nilotinib was escalated to the full dose of 400 mg twice daily. The patient tolerated the treatment well. Results The patient required about half-a-year support with Eltrombopag; after that it was discontinued as the platelet count remained above 40 K. No dose reduction of Nilotinib was necessary. In January 2012 the patient reached the milestone of Complete Cytogentic Response with the level of bcr/abl transcript minus 2 or less, which continued to decrease and now the patient is achieving a Major Molecular Response. Conclusion Treatment of CML with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors \u2013 Imatinib, Dasatinib, or Nilotinib in our patient \u2013 can be complicated by severe thrombocytopenia. These patients\u2019 next treatment option may be a Bone marrow transplant. Limited use of Eltrombopag can improve thrombocytopenia, and allow these patients to continue TKIs with attainment of the treatment milestons. Disclosures: Off Label Use: Eltrombopag. It is used in thrombocytopenia, in ITP. In this presentation it was used to treat thrombocytopenia secondary to Thyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia.",
