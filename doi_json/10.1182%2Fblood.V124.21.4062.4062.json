    "abstract_text": "Important therapeutic approaches to sickle-cell disease (SCD) are based upon the observation that the abnormal properties of Hb S (Hb \u03b1 2 \u03b2 S 2 ) can be mitigated by exchanging the pathological \u03b2 S -globin subunit for a related \u03b2-like subunit. We previously demonstrated that exchange of the non-pathological \u03b1-globin subunit for a \u03b6-globin subunit (a developmentally silenced globin that can be derepressed both by natural and experimental conditions) inhibits deoxyHb S polymer assembly in vitro and reverses hematological, biochemical, and physiological characteristics of SCD in mouse models in vivo . While its therapeutic potential is clear, the underlying structural basis for the profound antipolymer activity of \u03b6-substituted Hb S (Hb \u03b6 2 \u03b2 S 2 ) is less certain. X-ray crystallographic studies conducted at 1.95\u00c5 resolution revealed that liganded (CO-) Hb \u03b6 2 \u03b2 S 2 is trapped in a tense (T-state) quaternary structure, rather than in a relaxed (R-state) structure that is characteristic of nearly all liganded hemoglobins. Specifically, CO-Hb \u03b6 2 \u03b2 S 2 exhibited several intact T-state intersubunit salt-bridge/hydrogen-bond interactions, a preserved T-state \u03b61-\u03b22 (\u03b62-\u03b21) interface, and a characteristically enlarged T-state central water cavity and \u03b2-cleft. This structure wrongly predicts that liganded Hb \u03b6 2 \u03b2 S 2 will be included, rather than excluded, from the deoxyHb S polymer; and suggests that changes in the positions or the biochemical identities of individual amino acids, rather than the overall quaternary structure of liganded Hb \u03b6 2 \u03b2 S 2 , are the chief determinants of its antipolymer activity. To define key differences in the structures of T-state deoxyHb \u03b1 2 \u03b2 S 2 and CO-Hb \u03b6 2 \u03b2 S 2 , we superposed their corresponding globin subunits and calculated the specific displacement of individual amino-acid residues as root mean square deviation (rmsd) values. Among \u03b2 S -chain residues, \u03b1\u2192\u03b6 exchange effects a significant 1.9\u00c5 shift in the position of the pathological \u03b2 S Val6, and correspondingly large displacements of \u03b2Thr4 (2.2\u00c5) and \u03b2Asn19 (1.4\u00c5); each repositioning predicts weakening of an intermolecular interaction that would otherwise stabilize the deoxyHb S polymer. Similar superposition analyses of the \u03b1 and \u03b6 chains reveal a significant displacement of \u03b1Pro114 (1.3\u00c5), a well-described determinant of deoxyHb S polymerization that is conserved between the two \u03b1-like subunits. Three additional \u03b1-chain residues that stabilize the deoxyHb S polymer undergo nonconservative replacement in the \u03b6-globin chain, but are not materially repositioned: \u03b1His20\u2192\u03b6Gln (basic\u2192neutral polar), \u03b1Asn68\u2192\u03b6Asp (neutral polar\u2192acidic), and \u03b1Asn78\u2192\u03b6Gly (neutral polar\u2192neutral). While all three replacements are predicted to weaken or ablate intermolecular contacts, the \u03b1His20\u2192\u03b6Gln substitution is particularly noteworthy as it reproduces the specific mutation that defines the naturally occurring anti-sickling variant \u03b1 Le Lamentin . Finally, we considered the possibility that \u03b6-substituted Hb S is fully excluded from the deoxyHb S polymer--and therefore reduces the rate of its assembly--by comparing the crystal packing of the two hemoglobins. While deoxyHb \u03b1 2 \u03b2 S 2 packs in a familiar two-strand structure, CO-Hb \u03b6 2 \u03b2 S 2 assembles into a unique trimeric arrangement comprising three lateral heterotetramers, each of which interacts with an axial heterotetramer that is constituent to a separate trimer assembly. This remarkable structure is sustained by intermolecular interactions that are distinct from those observed for deoxyHb S. Moreover, the calculated buried solvent-accessible surface area for CO-Hb \u03b6 2 \u03b2 S 2 (4806\u00c5 2 ) is nearly two-fold higher than for deoxyHb \u03b1 2 \u03b2 S 2 (2510\u00c5 2 ), suggesting that Hb \u03b6 2 \u03b2 S 2 exists in solution as a stable trimer of heterotetramers, and validating the hypothesis that Hbs \u03b1 2 \u03b2 S 2 and \u03b6 2 \u03b2 S 2 do not co-assemble in solution. In sum, our crystal analyses indicate that the antipolymer activities of liganded Hb \u03b6 2 \u03b2 S 2 arise through movements in the positions of \u03b2 S -chain residues, and through changes in the identities of \u03b1-chain residues. Our studies also demonstrate a novel packing structure for T-state liganded Hb \u03b6 2 \u03b2 S 2 that is consistent with its exclusion from the deoxyHb S polymer. These data account for the significant antipolymer activity of \u03b6-substituted Hb S, and recommend the utility of therapeutic approaches to SCD that are based upon \u03b1-globin subunit exchange.
