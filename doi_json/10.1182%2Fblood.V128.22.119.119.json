    "abstract_text": "Multiple Myeloma (MM) remains an incurable malignancy in part because of an incomplete understanding of which genes are critically responsible for MM cell survival and proliferation. To address this unmet need, and building on our recent functional genomics studies with the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing platform (ASH 2015; Int. MM Workshop, Rome 2015), we reasoned that quantification of sgRNA depletion in the absence of any treatment could identify genes essential for the survival or proliferation of MM cells and better define their role as candidate therapeutic targets. To this end, we transduced Cas9-expressing RPMI-8226 and MM.1S cells with the lentiviral genome-scale GeCKO pooled library of sgRNAs. After culture of these cell lines for 2, 6, 8 or 12 weeks without any treatment, we identified, based on next generation sequencing for the sgRNA sequences, genes with significantly depleted sgRNAs (4-6 sgRNAs/gene, >2-fold average depletion, FDR=0.05, based on MAGECK algorithm) in Cas9+ cells compared to their initial sgRNA plasmid pools, baseline cultures, or isogenic parental Cas9-negative cells. These results were confirmed for each cell line with a 2nd independent genome-wide analysis and with a focused sgRNA library containing a subset of candidates defined by the genome-wide analyses. We compared these results with data from our in-house or publicly available CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing studies, involving a total of 50 cell lines from other hematologic malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma) and from 8 different types of solid tumors. We identified 3 broad categories of essential genes in MM cells: a) core essential genes, with sgRNA depletion across the majority of MM and non-MM lines of our study, representing cellular processes critical for practically all lineages (e.g. genes involved in regulation of basic transcription factor complexes, ribosomal function, proteasome, spliceosome, structural proteins for mitochondria and other key organelles, et.c.); b) genes selectively essential for MM cell lines, but not for the overwhelming majority of leukemia, lymphoma or solid tumor cell lines; c) genes with a role in small subset(s) of cell lines, across diseases, which harbor defined genetic features correlating with this dependency. We integrated our CRISPR/Cas9-based data on MM-selective essential genes with a reanalysis of the Achilles Heel shRNA screen in MM and non-MM cell lines (10 and 493, respectively) of the Cell Line Encyclopedia Program (CCLE) program. We applied a series of statistical tests (e.g. Wilcoxon rank test or marker selection feature of GENE-E algorithm with 1000 permutation tests) to identify genes with a significantly lower rank in sgRNA or shRNA depletion in MM vs. non-MM cell lines, across different specific thresholds for fold change and statistical significance. We identified more than 50 high-value candidate target genes with preferential essentiality in MM, compared to non-MM cell lines of diverse lineages. Prominent examples of such MM-selective, essential genes included: transcription factors (e.g. IRF4 , CCND2 , MAF , NFKB1, NFKB2, RELA, RELB); otherNF-kB-related genes (e.g. IKBKB ); PIM2 (but not PIM1 or PIM3 in this cell line panel); regulators of protein homeostasis, including diverse E2 and E3 ubiquitin ligases; and several other known or biologically-plausible dependencies which are under further evaluation. Many of these MM-selective dependencies exhibited significantly higher expression in MM, compared to non-MM cells, both in cell lines (based on the CCLE dataset) and patient-derived samples (comparison of Broad/MMRF vs. TCGA datasets, respectively). Notable observations of context-dependent essential genes include ARID1A in MM.1S cells (plausibly due to deficiency in its paralog ARID1B); and cases of both MM and non-MM cells with RAS mutations but lack of dependency on that gene. Targeting of lineage-specific dependencies (e.g. ER or AR in breast or prostate Ca, respectively) has provided major clinical benefit in some tumors; while context-specific dependencies are a cornerstone of molecularly-guided individualized treatments. Therefore, by identifying lineage- and context-dependent essential genes for MM, our integrated genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 and shRNA analyses in molecularly annotated panels of MM vs. non-MM cell lines provide an attractive framework towards designing novel therapies for MM.
