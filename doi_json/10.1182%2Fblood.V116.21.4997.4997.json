    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4997 Purpose This analysis was aimed to compare clinical features in different age cohorts of multiple myeloma (MM) patients and to identify the impact of the clinical characteristics on survival in the patients in a single center. Patients and Methods We retrospectively analyzed data from 513 patients between Sep 1995 and Feb 2010 in the Asan Medical Center. Correlation of baseline characteristics with survival was made by the following age strata: <45, 45\u201354, 55\u201364, and \u226565 years of age. Results Median observed overall survival (OS) in the entire cohort was 3.20 years (95% confidence interval: 2.71\u20133.68). Observed survival decreased steadily with ages from 4.56 years in patients younger than age 45 years to 2.50 years in patients \u226565 years ( P =0.003). The patients in the oldest group (age 65 years or older) were more likely to have International Staging System (ISS) stage II or III than others ( P =0.007). There were no significant differences in hypercalcemia (\u226510 mg/dL), elevated serum creatinine (\u22652 mg/dL), anemia (Hb <10 g/dL) and osteolytic bone lesion, so called CRAB among the different age cohorts. Prognostic factors including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (\u2265 0.8mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bone marrow plasma cell infiltration also did not differ significantly among 10-year age cohorts. However, hypoalbuminemia (<3.5 g/dL) and high serum \u03b22-microglobulin (\u22653.5 mg/dL) level were more frequent in patients \u226565 years of age ( P =0.001 and P =0.046, respectively). Furthermore, higher proportion of patients underwent ASCT in the younger 10-year age cohorts (71.4%, 53.7%, 43.4%, 2.5% in < 45, 45\u201354, 55\u201364, and \u2265 65 years of age, respectively, P <0.001). Conclusion No significant differences in the myeloma related organ or tissue impairment and prognostic markers including CRP, LDH and bone marrow infiltration of myeloma cells were noted among different age groups. However, survival significantly declined in the higher age group, which might be related to higher ISS stage associated with hypoalbuminemia, high serum \u03b22-microglobulin level and lower proportion of patients receiving ASCT.
