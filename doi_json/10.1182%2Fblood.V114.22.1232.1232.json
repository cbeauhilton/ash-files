    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1232 Poster Board I-254 B-Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) shows a strong familial risk and also co-aggregates with other indolent lymphomas. Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is an asymptomatic hematologic condition characterized by small B-cell clones, most with a surface phenotype similar to that of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). These clones are detectable at low absolute lymphocyte cell (ALC) numbers in otherwise healthy individuals using sensitive 6 or 8 color flow cytometry analysis and can be a precursor to CLL. In the general population, MBL increases with age with a prevalence of 5% in individuals over age 65. In contrast, the rate of MBL is 13-18% in first degree relatives of CLL patients in high risk families. In the largest study to date, we report the characteristics of MBL among 430 first-degree relatives of CLL patients (with no associated lymphoproliferative diseases [LPD]) in 132 high risk families. Patients and Methods Individuals studied came from \u201chigh risk\u201d families (defined as those with two or more confirmed cases of CLL) that are participating in the Genetic Epidemiology of CLL Consortium. Multi-parameter flow cytometry analysis with a detection sensitivity of 0.02% was performed on either fresh or cryopreserved PBMC and MBL was classified according to previously published criteria (Marti et al, Br. J Haematol 130:325, 2005). Both the ALC and the absolute B cell count (B-ALC) were calculated for each individual. Survival analysis was used to compute the probability of developing MBL with age using the life table method. Results The overall rate of MBL was 17% (73/430) among first\u2013degree relatives but the probability for developing MBL by age 90 was 51%. Males had a slightly higher (but non-significant) risk for MBL than females. MBL patients had significantly higher ALC and B-ALC than did those with normal immunophenotype. The mean ALC was 2.5\u00d710 9 /L among MBL patients, and 20% had an ALC greater than 3 \u00d710 9 /L. The B-ALC count averaged 0.51 \u00d710 9 /L. Ninety percent of the MBL cases had a CLL-like phenotype (CD20dim, CD5+, CD23+). Conclusions MBL is found at a very high rate in families selected for having 2 or more patients with CLL suggesting that MBL reflects inherited predisposition to CLL. Although most of the MBL cases in these families had low cell counts and thus have a presumed low likelihood of progressing to CLL or other LPD, a higher proportion of them had lymphocytosis compared to those with normal immunophenotype. We hypothesize that if MBL is an early step in the process of development of CLL, then germ line genes are likely to be acting early in carcinogenesis with more \u201chits\u201d required before CLL develops. By looking for genes associated with MBL or CLL in families or in the population, we could substantially increase our power to identify germ line genes predisposing to CLL.
