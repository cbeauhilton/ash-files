    "abstract_text": "The use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in cancer treatment is seriously hampered by the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and cancer relapse. During acute GVHD, inflammatory cytokines play a pivotal role in the amplification of GVHD. Therefore, assessment of agents with known anti-neoplastic activity that also reduce cytokine production may be useful in both the prevention of GVHD and cancer relapse. The synthetic triterpenoid, CDDO (2-cyano-3, 12-dioxooleana-1, 9-dien-28-oic acid) is multifunctional molecule which has shown potent anti-cancer activities both in vitro and in vivo through the induction of apoptosis. We first examined the effects of CDDO on both human and murine T cell mitogen responses in vitro. CDDO significantly inhibited mitogen responsiveness of both human and murine T cells in vitro with evidence of cell cycle arrest of the human T cells. We then proceeded to examine the effects of CDDO on acute GVHD induction and progression. In these studies, lethally irradiated C57BL/6 mice received 10 million bone marrow cells (BMC) and 40 million spleen cells from fully MHC-mismatched BALB/c donors. All of the control mice succumbed rapidly due to acute GVHD. In contrast, the mice that received CDDO (120 ug/BID) given from days 0-3 following BMT exhibited significant improvement in survival (P < 0.001). Body weights from the treated mice also were significantly increased compared to untreated controls. We found that the timing of CDDO administration was a critical factor for protection from GVHD as protection only occurred when CDDO was administered early after BMT. Importantly, donor myeloid reconstitution was not adversely affected by CDDO treatment as determined by peripheral blood cell count and donor chimerism assessment on day +14 post-transplant. No adverse toxicities or effects on reconstitution were observed in the mice receiving BMC alone with CDDO being administered continuously. Given the reported direct anti-tumor effects of CDDO, it will be of particular interest in examining the effects of CDDO and allogeneic BMT in tumor-bearing recipients. Our findings suggest that CDDO can enhance the efficacy of allogeneic BMT by decreasing acute GVHD in mice."
