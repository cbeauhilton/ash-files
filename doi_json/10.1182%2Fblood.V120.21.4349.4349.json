    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4349 Background: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in immune-tolerance to allograft. Unbalance between Tregs and effector T cells is involved in graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and other autoimmune disorders. Adoptive use of inducible Tregs (iTregs) is a candidate immunosuppressive therapy, and major concern has been focused on sustained expression of Foxp3 in iTregs. We previously reported that iTregs can be efficiently expanded from cord blood (CB)-derived CD4 + T cells in the presence of IL2, TGFb and a mTOR inhibitor, Everolimus (Eve). However, the effect of Eve on in vitro induction of iTreg remains to be elucidated. Here we studied the impact of Eve on CB-CD4 + T cells. Methods: CD4 + T cells were prepared from CB with a purity of >95% and put into the flask coated with anti-CD3/CD28 MAb. For Treg induction, these cultures were supplemented with IL2, IL-2/TGFb, IL2/TGFb/Eve, or IL2/Eve and kept for two weeks. The resulting CD4+ T cells including variable proportion of iTregs were subjected to mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) along with CFSE-labeled autologous responder T cells and allogeneic dendritic cells (DCs) as stimulator. Results: The basal proportion of CD25 + Foxp3 + cells in CB-CD4 + T cells was 0.60 \u00b1 0.59%. After two weeks, the induction rate of CD25 + Foxp3 + CD4 + T cells was higher in the culture with IL2/TGFb/Eve than that with IL2/TGFb, but Eve itself could not significantly induce iTregs in the absence of TGFb ( Figure1 .). The iTreg ratio (CD25 + Foxp3 + cells/total CD4 + T cells) was 79.3 \u00b1 17.4% in the culture with IL2/TGFb/Eve, 53.1 \u00b1 23.8% with IL2/TGFb, 35.5\u00b118.6% with IL2/Eve and 22.7 \u00b1 18.6% with IL2, respectively. There was no significant relationship between the dose of Eve and the iTreg ratio, but the highest ratio and induction rate of iTregs were observed at 10nM Eve. Thus, an average of 2.95 \u00b1 2.8 \u00d710 7 iTregs was obtained from 5 \u00d710 4 CB-CD4 + T cells after two weeks of culture with IL2/TGFb/Eve. The iTreg-rich population cultured with IL2/TGFb/Eve and IL2/TGFb, but not IL2 alone, efficiently inhibited MLR triggered by allogeneic DCs ( Figure 2 .). These iTregs were also active in MLR using allogeneic responder T cells. Interestingly, IL2/Eve-treated CB-CD4 + T cells also inhibited MLR, irrespective of the low or moderate iTreg ratio. The inhibitory effect on MLR was much less observed by another mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, rather than Eve ( Figure2 ). Expression of CD26 on CD4 + T cells was inversely correlated to Foxp3 expression and significantly down-regulated by TGFb with or without Eve. Discussion: Treatment of CB-CD4 + T cells with IL2/TGFb/Eve results in the efficient ex vivo expansion of functional iTregs. Eve enhanced TGFb induction of Foxp3 expression, but did not induce Foxp3 expression by itself. mTOR is a complex of TORC1 and 2. Rapamycin is reported to inhibit TORC1, while Eve inhibits both of them, at general dose. In recent report, mTOR-deficient T cells (TORC1/2, not TORC1 alone) displayed normal activation and IL-2 production upon initial stimulation, but failed to differentiate into effecter T cells, instead, differentiated into Tregs. Although the direct mechanism to inhibit MLR by CB-CD4+ T cells treated with Eve remained to be elucidated, these results suggested the aberrant pathways of immunological inhibition.
