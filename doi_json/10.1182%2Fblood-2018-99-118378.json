    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) are routinely exploited in the clinic to treat patients with cancers or other hematologic diseases. The transcription factor nuclear factor I-X (NFIX) has a proven role regulating migration, adhesion, differentiation and quiescence in neural stem cells. Importantly, Nfix was recently shown to be upregulated in FLT3-ITD+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples and the NFI binding motif was protected during DNase hypersensitivity screening. We recently identified Nfix as a novel regulator of HSPC repopulating potential. Using our mouse models, Nfix flox/flox Rosa26 -CreER T2 and Nfix +/+ Rosa26 -CreER T2 , we induced the deletion of Nfix and performed competitive transplants; here we observe a 50% increase in chimerism 20 weeks post-transplant accompanied by a 10% increase in reconstitution of peripheral blood (PB) B cells. Primary recipient whole bone marrow (WBM) was then transplanted into secondary recipients. Beginning four weeks post-transplant, a 2.5-fold loss of PB myeloid reconstitution was observed in secondary recipients of Nfix -deficient WBM. This effect persisted beyond 20 weeks post-secondary transplant, suggesting that a self-renewing myeloid-biased HSPC is functionally perturbed by the loss of Nfix . To identify genes transcriptionally regulated by NFIX, we recently validated an anti-NFIX monoclonal antibody that is currently being used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by paired-end sequencing. Future efforts will focus on investigating Nfix -deficient myeloid-biased HSC subsets. This study will illuminate the transcriptional control of specific HSC subsets.
