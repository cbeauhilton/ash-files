    "abstract_text": "Besides their role as antigen presenting cells, human peripheral blood mononuclear cell and CD34+ cell-derived dendritic cells (DCs), now have been demonstrated to exert cytotoxicity against some tumor cells, and their tumoricidal activity can be enhanced by some stimili. However, there have been no reports concerning the tumor-cell killing activity by human cord blood cell-derived dendritic cells (CBDCs). We report here that human cord blood monocyte-derived DCs aquire the ability to kill tumor cells after activation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interferon-\u03b3(IFN-\u03b3), associated with the enhanced TNF-\u03b1-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) expression in CBDC cytoplasm. The CD14-positive cells collected from cord blood from healthy volunteers were cultured with interleukin-4 and granulocyte-machrophage colony- stimulating factor for seven days to induce CBDCs, which showed no cytotoxicity. However, after activation with IFN-\u03b3 for additional 12 hours, CBDCs exhibited cytotoxicity against HL60 and Jurkat cells, while activation with LPS for 12 hours induced cytotoxicity against Daudi and Jurkat cells as we detected in human peripheral blood monocytes- drived DCs (PBDCs). IFN-\u03b3 or LPS stimulation enhanced intracellular but not cellular surface TRAIL, and neither intracellular nor cellular surface Fas Ligand as analyzed by flow cytometry. Our results suggest that activated CBDCs can serve as immunological effectors against tumor cells, through TRAIL- dependent and Fas-independent mechanisms."
