    "abstract_text": "Abstract 16 Immunization using tumor antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DC) holds promise for the adjuvant treatment of cancer to control residual disease. In a phase I/II trial, we investigated the effect of autologous DC vaccination in 17 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in remission but at high risk of full relapse. Wilms\u2019 tumor 1 protein (WT1), a nearly universal tumor antigen, was chosen as an immunotherapeutic target because of its established role in leukemogenesis and superior immunogenic characteristics. Two out of 3 patients, who were in partial remission with morphologically demonstrable disease after chemotherapy, were brought into complete remission following 4 biweekly intradermal injections of WT1 mRNA-electroporated DC. In those 2 patients as well as in 7 other patients who were in complete remission but who had molecularly demonstrable residual disease, there was a return to normal of the AML-associated WT1 mRNA tumor marker following DC vaccination, compatible with clinical and molecular response in 9/17 patients. In 3 patients, the WT1 mRNA tumor marker returned to pathological values following normalization after initial DC vaccination and additional injections of DC were needed to bring back the tumor marker to normal. Of the 9 responders, 3 have relapsed and 2 have died. Of the 8 non-responders, 7 have relapsed and 7 have died. Of the 2 patients in partial remission who were brought into complete remission by the DC vaccination, 1 has relapsed and has died. Median overall survival was 52.0 months in responders as compared to 6.0 months in non-responders (P=0.0007). Median relapse-free survival was 47.0 months in responders and 3.0 months in non-responders (P smaller than 0.0001). Immunomonitoring performed on the first 10 patients, showed a significant increase in WT1-specific interferon-gamma+ CD8+ T cells and signs of general immune stimulation, such as a significant increase of plasma levels of interleukin 2 and of HLA-DR+ CD4+ T-cells. Clinical responses were correlated with elevated levels of activated natural killer cells post-vaccination. Long-term clinical responses, lasting for at least 3 years, were significantly correlated with an increase in polyepitope WT1-specific tetramer+ CD8+ T-cell frequencies. There was no significant change post-vaccination in WT1 antibody levels or of regulatory T lymphocytes. In conclusion, DC-based immunotherapy elicits both innate and adaptive cellular immune responses correlated with clinical benefit. WT1 mRNA-loaded DC emerge as a feasible and effective strategy to control residual disease in AML, in particular as a post-remission treatment to prevent full relapse.
