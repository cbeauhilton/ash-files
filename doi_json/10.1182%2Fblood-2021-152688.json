    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy of plasma cells that is nearly always incurable. T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) that target B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) can recognize and eliminate MM. The murine or other non-human sequences in the single-chain variable fragments (scFv) of many anti-BCMA CARs can elicit recipient immune responses against CAR T cells. We constructed a CAR incorporating an anti-BCMA fully-human heavy-chain variable domain designated FHVH33. FHVH33 lacks the light chain, the artificial linker sequence, and the 2 linker-associated junctions of a scFv, so FHVH33 is smaller than a scFv and is likely to be less immunogenic. The FHVH33-containing CAR utilized in this clinical trial also incorporated a CD8a hinge and transmembrane domain, a 4-1BB domain, and a CD3z domain. The CAR was designated FHVH33-CD8BBZ and was encoded by a gamma-retroviral vector. T cells expressing FHVH33-CD8BBZ were designated FHVH33-T. The FHVH33-T production process was initiated with unsorted peripheral blood mononuclear cells and took 7 days. The treatment protocol was 300 mg/m 2 of cyclophosphamide and 30 mg/m 2 of fludarabine on days -5 to -3 followed by infusion of FHVH33-T on day 0. Twenty-five patients received FHVH33-T infusions. Median age of the treated patients was 62 (range 39-73). Patients received a median of 6 prior lines of therapy (range 3-10). Five dose levels were assessed (Table). Dose level 4, 6x10 6 CAR + T cells/kg was identified as the maximum feasible dose after considering efficacy and manufacturing factors. Twenty-three of 25 patients (92%) obtained objective responses (OR) of partial response (PR) or better. Seventeen patients (68%) attained a best response of stringent complete response (sCR) or very good partial response (VGPR). Thirteen patients have ongoing responses. To date, the median duration of response is 50 weeks for the highest two dose levels. At present, the overall median progression free survival (PFS) is 78 weeks; as responses are ongoing in 13 patients (52%), PFS will likely improve. Nine of 25 patients had extramedullary plasmacytomas at baseline; patients with extramedullary plasmacytomas at baseline were less likely to achieve sCR (P=0.011). All 25 treated patients were evaluable for toxicity. Eighteen patients had grade 1 or 2 cytokine-release syndrome (CRS), and 6 patients had grade 3 CRS. One patient had no CRS. No patients had grade 4 CRS. Five patients received tocilizumab and 4 patients received corticosteroids for CRS. Two of twenty-five patients had grade 3 neurological toxicity possibly attributable to FHVH33-T. No patient had grade 4 neurologic toxicity attributable to CAR T cells. One patient died of influenza pneumonia. We assessed blood CAR+ cells by quantitative PCR. The median peak blood CAR+ cell level was 126.5 cells/\u00b5l (range 3-1071 cells/\u00b5l), and the median time post-infusion of peak blood CAR + cell levels was 10.5 days (range 7-14). Peak CAR T-cell level was not associated with obtaining a sCR. In contrast, blood CAR+ T cell levels at both 1 and 2 months after infusion were statistically higher for patients obtaining sCR. For the 1-month time-point, blood CAR+ cell levels in cells/mL were 20 for sCR patients and 4 for not sCR patients (P=0.04). Pretreatment serum BCMA was not statistically different when patients obtaining or not obtaining sCR were compared (median serum BCMA in pg/mL: sCR patients 86,243; not sCR patients 261,675, P=0.20). We assessed cell-surface BCMA expression level on MM cells by antibody binding capacity (ABC) flow cytometry. Cell-surface BCMA expression level was not statistically different in sCR versus not sCR patients (median ABC in sites/cell: sCR patients 844; not sCR patients 535, P=0.29). Patients with MM expressing low levels of BCMA obtained durable responses of greater than 2 years duration, which suggests that FHVH33-T can recognize low levels of cell-surface BCMA. Eight patients had extramedullary plasmacytomas at relapse; 4 patients had plasmacytomas biopsied. Two of the biopsied plasmacytomas were BCMA+, and two were BCMA-negative by immunohistochemistry. FHVH33-CD8BBZ CAR T cells caused relatively mild toxicity and a high rate of sCRs in patients with relapsed MM including MM with low cell-surface BCMA expression.
