    "abstract_text": "Increased TGF-\u03b2 expression in the bone marrow microenvironment is present in most cases of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), however, its contribution to disease pathogenesis is not well understood. Multiple prior studies show that TGF-\u03b2 suppresses the proliferation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) in vitro . However, its impact on HSCs in vivo is less clear, with conflicting data showing that TGF-\u03b2 suppresses or induces HSPC proliferation, depending upon the dose of TGF-\u03b2 and cell context. Here, we explore the hypothesis that HSPCs carrying a Jak2 V617F mutation are resistant to the suppressive effects of TGF-\u03b2, conferring a fitness advantage that contributes to their expansion in MPNs. To test this hypothesis, we first assessed TGF-\u03b2 signaling in wildtype (WT) and Jak2 V617F HSPCs. Whereas TGF-\u03b21 induced robust Smad2/3 phosphorylation in WT phenotypic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), it was barely detectable in Jak2 V617F HSCs. Interestingly, this phenotype was lost in lineage-restricted progenitors, where TGF-\u03b21-induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation was comparable in WT and Jak2 V617F cells. These data suggest that TGF-\u03b2 signaling, at least Smad2/3 phosphorylation, is selectively loss in Jak2 V617F HSCs but not lineage-restricted progenitors. Competitive repopulation assays (CRAs) were performed using WT and Jak2 V617F HSPCs in which Tgfbr2 was deleted to abrogate TGF-\u03b2 signaling in HSCs. We first established bone marrow chimeras containing equal amounts of WT and UBC-Cre ERT2 ; Tgfbr2 f/f HSPCs (hereafter referred to as TR2 KO cells). Tamoxifen was given 6 weeks after transplantation to activate Cre expression and delete Tgfbr2 . Multilineage donor chimerism of the Tgfbr2 -deleted cells increased over time, suggesting that TGF-\u03b2 signaling negatively regulates HSPC repopulating activity. However, when competing Jak2 V617F cells with Jak2 V617F TR2 KO cells, the TR2 KO compartment no longer had competitive advantage, suggesting that Jak2 mutated HSPC are insensitive to the suppressive effect of TGF-\u03b2. To extend these findings, CRAs were established that included the following 4 cohorts: 1) WT vs. Jak2 V617F ; 2) TR2 KO vs. Jak2 V617F ; 3) TR2 KO vs. Jak2 V617F TR2 KO ; and 4) WT vs. Jak2 V617F TR2 KO . In each case, a 5:1 ratio of competitor to Jak2 -mutated cells was used and tamoxifen was given 6 weeks after transplantation to induce both Cre-mediated deletion of Tgfbr2 and activation of the Jak2 V617F allele. In cohort 1, as expected, donor chimerism with Jak2 mutated cells increased over time (Figure 1A, black). Consistent with this finding, Jak2 mutant chimerism in HSPCs was increased at 12-14 weeks (Figure 1B). In cohort 2 (orange), the loss of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in WT HSPCs completely abrogated the competitive advantage of Jak2 V617F HSPCs. In fact, the TR2 KO cells outcompeted Jak2 V617F HSPCs. In cohort 3 (red), we asked whether loss of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in both WT and Jak2 V617F HSPCs \"leveled the playing field\". Indeed, no expansion of Jak2 mutant peripheral blood leukocytes or HSPCs was observed in these mice. Finally, in cohort 4 (blue), we observed that loss of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in Jak2 mutant cells had little impact on their repopulating activity. To assess the impact of TGF-\u03b2 signaling on WT and Jak2 V617F HSPC proliferation, we generated bone marrow chimeras containing either WT vs. Jak2 V617F HSPCs or TR2 KO vs. Jak2 V617F TR2 KO HSPCs. Of note, in both types of bone marrow chimeras, the presence of Jak2 mutant cells is expected to increase the local level of endogenous TGF-\u03b2. As expected, in the WT vs. Jak2 V617F chimeras, the Jak2 V617F HSPCs were less quiescent than WT cells. Surprisingly, loss of TGF-\u03b2 signaling resulted in an increase in HSC quiescence in both TR2 KO and Jak2 V617F TR2 KO HSCs. Of note, the loss of TGF-\u03b2 signaling again \"leveled the playing field\" with a similar percentage of quiescent TR2 KO vs. Jak2 V617F TR2 KO HSCs. Collectively, these data suggest that attenuated TGF-\u03b2 signaling in Jak2 V617F HSPCs plays a key role in the pathogenesis of MPN. Specifically, the data support a model in which increased local production of TGF-\u03b2 by Jak2 V617F hematopoietic cells selectively inhibits WT HSPCs, thereby promoting the expansion of Jak2 V617F HSPCs. Targeting TGF-\u03b2 signaling early in the course of MPN or in persons with Jak2 V617F clonal hematopoiesis may prevent or delay clonal progression.
