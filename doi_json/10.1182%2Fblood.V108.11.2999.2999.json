    "abstract_text": "RIC regimens permit older and less fit patients to receive allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We designed a novel RIC regimen (cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, TBI [CY/FLU/TBI]) to achieve sufficient anti-neoplastic potency for cytoreduction and adequate immunosuppression for engraftment yet have limited treatment related mortality (TRM). We report the results of 72 patients (58% male) receiving sibling donor HLA-identical (n=66; 92%) or single antigen mismatched (n=6; 8%) G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood SCT from 2002\u20132005. Eligible patients were >55 years or had prior SCT, ongoing but controlled infections, ventricular ejection fraction 35\u201345% or corrected DLCO 30\u201350%. All patients had chemotherapy sensitive disease or remission. Most patients had lymphoma (n=29; 40%) or acute leukemia/MDS (n=23; 32%); others (28%) had multiple myeloma, CML, CLL, aplastic anemia, or renal cell carcinoma. All acute leukemia patients were in CR (CR1=14, \u2265CR2=4). All lymphoma patients were chemosensitive; 4 were in CR. All patients received conditioning with FLU 40 mg/m 2 /day \u00d7 5 days, CY 50 mg/kg and 200 cGy TBI. Equine ATG 90 mg/kg plus methylprednisolone were given to those without recent combination chemotherapy (29%). GVHD prophylaxis included mycophenolate mofetil 1 gm BID and cyclosporine. The median age was 55 years (range, 11\u201365). The median graft cell dose infused was 5.4 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg (range, 0.6\u201315.5). Seventeen (24%) had previous SCT (14 autologous, 3 allogeneic). Neutrophil engraftment occurred at a median of 7 days (range, 0\u201313) and median time to platelet recovery >20K and >50K was 9 days (range, 0\u201351) and 14 days (range, 0\u201368), respectively. Median bone marrow chimerism by day 28 was 100% (range, 50\u2013100); only 11 patients were <90%. The cumulative incidence (95% CI) of Grade 2\u20134 acute GVHD was 47% (35\u201359) and Grade 3\u20134 acute GVHD was 24% (14\u201333). Chronic GVHD at 2 years was 48% (34\u201362). Treatment related mortality at 100 days and 1 year was low [100 day (95% CI): 11% (4\u201318%); 1 year: 17% (8\u201325)]. Causes of death (n=29) included relapse (52%), GVHD (21%), organ toxicity (24%), and fungal infection (3%). The cumulative incidence (95% CI) of relapse/progression for all patients was 37% (25\u201349) at 2 years [acute leukemia/MDS, 47% (24\u201371); lymphoma, 37% (18\u201355)]. After a median 29 months (range, 6\u201348) follow-up of survivors, progression-free (PFS) and overall (OS) survival were encouraging: [PFS: 1 year, 51% (39\u201362); 3 years, 43% (31\u201355); OS: 1 year 68% (57\u201379); 3 years, 58% (45\u201370)]. Importantly, almost no events (relapse or death) have occurred beyond 2 years yielding a plateau in PFS and OS. This novel CY/FLU/TBI conditioning regimen is well tolerated, effective, and associated with promising PFS and OS. Further application and testing in multi-center studies is warranted.
