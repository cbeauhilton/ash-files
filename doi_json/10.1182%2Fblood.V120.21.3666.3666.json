    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3666 Introduction With the FDA and EMA approval of Bendamustine a new treatment option has recently become available to patients (pts) with indolent (low-grade) non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL). Clinical registries provide insight into real-life treatment of pts. They can help to answer the question whether patients may benefit from new research findings. Methods The clinical registry on lymphoid neoplasms (TLN Registry), conducted by iOMEDICO in collaboration with the Arbeitskreis Klinische Studien (AKS) and the Kompetenznetz Maligne Lymphome (KML), prospectively collects data on the treatment of pts with lymphoid B-cell neoplasms as administered in hematology outpatient centres in Germany. Pts are followed for 5 years. A broad set of data regarding patient and tumor characteristics, comorbidities, all systemic treatments, response rates, progression-free survival and overall survival are recorded. Since May 2009, 106 sites have actively recruited a total of 2579 pts. Results From the overall sample, 645 pts received systemic 1 st -line treatment for indolent Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL). 53% of pts are male, mean age at time of primary diagnosis was 65 years (yrs) and at start of therapy 66 yrs. Tumor stage was 7% Stage I, 15% Stage II, 25% Stage III and 54% Stage IV. 61% of pts (n=387) were diagnosed with at least one comorbidity, mainly hypertension (33%) or diabetes (12%); the average Charlson Comorbity Index of 0.6 indicates that pts have few comorbities. Rituximab is part of the 1 st -line treatment in 94% (n=606) of pts with iNHL. Bendamustine is part of the 1 st -line treatment in 71% (n=455) of pts with iNHL. It is mostly applied in combination with Rituximab (BR, 66%, n=428). Further 2% (n=10) receive Bendamustin as monotherapy. Rituximab/Cyclophosphamide/Doxorubicin/Vincristine/Prednisone (R-CHOP) as 1 st -line treatment is applied in 16% (n=105) of pts with iNHL. Pts receiving BR or R-CHOP differ. Pts characteristics indicate that BR is applied preferably in elderly pts (mean 67.3 vs. 60.9 yrs). However, BR is the preferred treatment also in pts younger than 66 yrs (60% vs. 23%). The use of BR has increased from 62% in 2009 to 68% in 2011, whereas the rate of R-CHOP has decreased from 19% in 2009 to 15% in 2011. Of all pts with iNHL, 121 have received 2 nd -line treatment. Rituximab is part of the 2 nd -line treatment in 84% (n=102) of pts with iNHL. Bendamustine is part of the 2 nd -line treatment in 68% (n=82) of pts with iNHL. It is mostly applied in combination with Rituximab (BR, 60%, n=72). Further 7% (n=9) receive Bendamustin as monotherapy. R-CHOP as 2 nd -line treatment is applied in 7% (n=9) of pts with iNHL. Conclusion BR is the most frequently used systemic treatment for pts with iNHL in German hematology outpatient centres. The use of BR has continuously increased since 2009. In contrast, the use of R-CHOP has decreased. This indicates that in Germany R-CHOP can no longer be considered as \u201cstandard of care\u201d for pts with iNHL. These data also show that results from clinical trials are quickly implemented into daily practice. The impact of BR on quality of life and survival remains to be of central interest in the future.
