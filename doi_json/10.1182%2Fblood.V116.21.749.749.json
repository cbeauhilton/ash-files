    "abstract_text": "Abstract 749 Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is characterized by an overwhelming reactive infiltrate and the involvement of Epstein Barr virus (EBV) as a causative agent in a proportion of patients. We previously did a population-based genetic screening study of the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region in Dutch cHL patients and found a strong association between HLA class I (HLA-A1) and susceptibility to EBV+ cHL. This association might be explained by the known lack of HLA-A1 restricted T cell responses to EBV latent antigens. We now performed a case-control study to determine allele frequencies of all major HLA class I and class II genes in this cHL population. HLA genotyping of 294 cHL patients was performed by a polymerase chain reaction-based sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization (PCR-SSOP) approach in Luminex assays. The resulting single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data were converted into two-digit HLA typing for the HLA class I and class II genes. Phenotype frequencies of serologically defined HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR blood donors were retrieved from the database of the blood bank of the University Medical Center Groningen. Allele frequency differences between these controls and cHL patients (total group and EBV+ and EBV- subgroups separately) were analyzed by Chi-square tests. In addition, we analyzed the HLA genotyping data for every PCR-SSOP probe to assess potential differences between the EBV+ and EBV- cHL group using PLINK software. Frequencies of HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR7 were significantly decreased and HLA-B5 and HLA-B37 were significantly increased in cHL as compared to the controls. In EBV+ cHL, HLA-A1, HLA-B37 and HLA-DR10 frequencies were significantly increased and HLA-A2 was decreased. An increase in HLA-B8, an allele that can present EBV peptides and that usually is in strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA-A1, was not present in these patients. In EBV- cHL, HLA-DR5 was significantly more common and HLA-DR4 was underrepresented. The SNP analysis revealed significant differences for 16 HLA-A probes between EBV+ and EBV- cHL. Eight probes that represented a high susceptibility for EBV+ cHL were specific for HLA-A1, whereas the other 8 probes correlated with a low risk for EBV+ cHL and were specific for HLA-A2. Most of the corresponding SNPs had a presumed antigenic peptide or T cell receptor binding function. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that certain HLA alleles are protective or predisposing for cHL with specific associations for the EBV+ and EBV- cHL subgroups. The genotype analysis indicates that the complete HLA-A1 and HLA-A2 alleles are more important than individual T-cell receptor or antigen binding polymorphisms for the association with EBV+ cHL.
