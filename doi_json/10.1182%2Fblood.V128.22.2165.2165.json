    "abstract_text": "Encouraging clinical outcomes in autologous cellular immunotherapy have garnered hope and excitement. However, considerable challenges and limitations of patient-derived cancer immunotherapies remain and need to be addressed in order to consistently deliver reliable and efficacious therapies with broadened applicability. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are a unique, renewable source for the continuous generation of cellular therapeutics for the treatment of hematological and non-hematological malignancies, and represent a highly promising approach for overcoming many of the limitations of autologous therapy. To advance the promise of hiPSC technology as an \"off-the-shelf\" source of cellular therapeutics, several considerations need to be addressed. Enabling cell transfer across histocompatibility barriers to permit persistence and therapeutic efficacy in an allogeneic setting is a key requirement. In addition to improving persistence, the ability to overcome histocompatibility barriers may facilitate multi-dosing regimens which may be a requirement in more advanced and complicated disease settings. Genetic incompatibilities between donor and recipient among the classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules is the leading cause of alloresponse by the host immune system and is currently mitigated by immunosuppressive strategies. Unfortunately, this treatment strategy is not only a stressful event for the patient but also damages the endogenous immune system, compromising the patient's ability to continue to fight the disease and opportunistic infections. Genetic editing of the HLA genes to generate histocompatible universal cell products is a viable opportunity that is currently being investigated. In addition to selective editing of unique genes to avoid a T cell mediated alloresponse, additional considerations such as natural killer (NK) cell-mediated rejection will need to be addressed. We have previously demonstrated that our proprietary reprogramming platform supports efficient and rapid derivation of clonal hiPSC lines with properties indicative of the na\u00efve state of pluripotency. In addition to maintaining a homogeneous renewable population of hiPSCs, our platform is amenable to precise multi-gene and multi-loci targeted engineering at the single cell level, in both nuclease -dependent and -independent strategies. Furthermore, we have shown through small molecule-guided differentiation protocols, these highly-stable pluripotent cell lines can be banked and repeatedly tapped to consistently produce homogenous populations of immune cells with enhanced effector properties. Here we demonstrate a multi-faceted and comprehensive approach for the generation of immune tolerant hiPSCs and hiPSC-derived immune effector cells. We successfully combined deletion of classical HLA molecules with enforced expression of robust immunosuppressive proteins, including non-classical HLA molecules, to generate clonal hiPSC lines with the ability to escape immune rejection for \" o ff- t he- s helf\" (OTS-hiPSCs) cellular immunotherapy. Utilizing in vitro real-time quantitative live cell analysis we determined that OTS-hiPSCs elicit a significantly decreased cytotoxic response from both activated peripheral blood (PB)-NK cells and primed PB-T cells compared to wildtype controls. Furthermore we demonstrate that OTS-hiPSCs exhibit improved persistence in xenograft studies in vivo. Bilateral teratomas were formed in a non-conditioned, fully immune-competent recipient mice using luciferized wildtype and OTS-hiPSCs. Daily bioluminescence imaging over a period of 7 days revealed a significant increase (>50 fold difference) in persistence of OTS-hiPSCs compared to wildtype hiPSCs during the 60-144 hour post injection window. Lastly we demonstrate that OTS-hiPSCs can successfully differentiate into functional effector lymphocytes using our potent chemically-defined monolayer hematopoietic differentiation platform. Our current studies focus on the functional characterization of OTS-hiPSC-derived effector lymphocytes in humanized mouse models and generating increased potency of OTS-hiPSC-derived effector lymphocytes through precise genetic engineering of antigen targeting and costimulatory proteins to create and optimized source of \"off-the-shelf\" cell-based immunotherapies.
