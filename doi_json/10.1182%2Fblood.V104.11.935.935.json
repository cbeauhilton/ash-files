    "abstract_text": "Background: Total therapy III (TT-III) is designed to improve the outcome of newly diagnosed myeloma (MM) patients (pts), especially those presenting with unfavorable cytogenetics. Induction employs 2 cycles of V-DTPACE (Velade \u2122 , dexamethasone, thalidomide, cisplatin, adryamycin\u00ae, cytoxan\u00ae, etoposide) followed by tandem melphalan 200 mg/m 2 autologous stem cell transplants (ASCT). Objective: to evaluate the safety outcome of TT-III pts. Materials and Methods: Prospective evaluation of the toxicities occurring throughout treatment in 62 TT-III pts enrolled between February and July 2004. Results: Median age was 59 years (range: 23\u201374) and 41 pts (66 %) were males. The 1 st and 2 nd induction cycles were completed in 42 (68%) and 22 (35%) pts respectively, whereas 19 pts (31%) underwent their 1 st ASCT. Infections and/or Grades III\u2013IV gastrointestinal tract (GIT) toxicities (NCI Common Toxicity Criteria) were observed throughout treatment in 32 (76%) patients (table). One treatment-related death occurred in an 80 y.o. male with significant pre-existing comorbidities. Conclusion: Gastrointestinal tract toxicities and pneumonia were the most frequent complications following TT-III. Studies are ongoing to identify the risk factors for and interventions to decrease their incidence and severity. Infections and Grade III -IV GIT toxicities throughout TT-III  Toxicity .
