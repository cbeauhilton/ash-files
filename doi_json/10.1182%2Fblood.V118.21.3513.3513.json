    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3513 To identify targets for rational combination therapies with 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza) in myeloid malignancies, we utilized high-throughput RNA-interference (RNAi) viability screening. A siRNA library targeting 572 kinases and a custom collection of 289 putative cancer targets, including cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory genes, were screened alone and in combination with 5-Aza in TF-1 and ML-2 myeloid leukemia cell lines to identify synergistic interactions in reducing cell viability. Of the 572 kinases that were individually silenced, less than 1% significantly increased sensitivity to 5-Aza. The kinase library was also screened in combination with 5-Aza in a third myeloid cell line, THP-1, confirming that few kinases sensitize to 5-Aza when inhibited. While few kinases sensitized to 5-Aza, the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family of genes emerged as potent sensitizers to 5-Aza from RNAi screens. Therefore, silencing by siRNA of BCL-XL, BCL-2, BCL-W, MCL-1 and BFL-1 was evaluated in combination with 5-Aza treatment in an expanded panel of myeloid cell lines including TF-1, HEL, THP-1, ML-2 and MDS-L. BCL-XL validated as a vulnerability and potent sensitizer to 5-Aza in erythroid leukemia cell lines TF-1 and HEL, whereas MCL-1 was a strong vulnerability in the monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 and also a moderate sensitizer to 5-Aza in ML-2, THP-1, TF-1 and HEL. Published proteomics data from our group indicate that M6 and M7 leukemias exhibit higher levels of BCL-XL, while additional unpublished data suggest elevated levels of MCL-1 in M4 and M5 leukemias, supporting our functional observations. Additionally, data from the public database Oncomine suggest that BCL-XL expression is elevated in M6 and M7 leukemias while MCL-1 shows a trend towards elevation in M4 and M5 leukemias. Based on RNAi screening results, siRNA validation experiments and proteomic/mRNA expression data, we evaluated the BCL-2/BCL-XL/BCL-W inhibitor ABT-737 in combination with 5-Aza. ABT-737 resulted in dose-dependent sensitization to 5-Aza in all AML-derived cell lines examined (including M7, M6, M5, M4 and M2 FAB subtypes) and in the MDS cell line MDS-L; however, no sensitization was observed in the CML cell line K562. In extensive ex vivo experiments with 17 primary specimens, potent synergy between 5-Aza and ABT-737 was observed in AML, MDS and MPN samples, but not in most CML samples examined. Calculations with CalcuSyn software demonstrate synergy, with combination index values as low as 0.2, between 5-Aza and ABT-737 both ex vivo and in vitro . The combination of 5-Aza with ABT-737 resulted in substantial induction of apoptosis, measured by the induction of cleaved caspase 3 in TF-1 and HL-60 cells, as compared to either compound alone. Interestingly, although siRNA silencing of MCL-1 in combination with 5-Aza was potent across several cell lines, and silencing of BCL-XL preferentially in an erythroid differentiation background, ABT-737 with 5-Aza sensitized across a variety of cell lines and all myeloid primary specimens ex vivo . We suggest that inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members is a most promising rational combination strategy with 5-Aza for the treatment of leukemias. Our results also highlight the potential utility of more specific anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family inhibitors in the lineage-specific treatment of myeloid malignancies.
