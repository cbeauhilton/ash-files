    "abstract_text": "Abstract 355 Approximately one-third of patients considered for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched related donors (MRD). HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) HCT is an alternative approach for the others. A prior CIBMTR analysis showed that transplantation from MUD and MRD donors produces similar survival for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (Blood 2012; 119(17):3908\u201316). Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) often are older and have more compromised performance status than patients with AML. There are also differences in disease biology and pre-transplant therapies between the disorders that could lead to different outcomes. Therefore, a disease-specific analysis of post-HCT outcomes after MUD vs. MRD was performed. Outcomes of 701 adult MDS patients who underwent allogeneic HCT between 2002 and 2006 were analyzed (MRD, n=176; 8/8 HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 allele matched MUD, n=413; 7/8 MUD, n=112). Median age was 53 years (range, 22\u201378). Thirty-one percent had Karnofsky performance scores (KPS) <90% at HCT. Sixty-five percent had advanced disease and 19% had therapy-related MDS. Seventy-seven percent received peripheral blood stem cells; 40% received reduced intensity conditioning regimens. The 100-day cumulative incidence of grades B-D (IBMTR Index) acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was significantly lower in MRD HCT recipients than in 8/8 MUD and 7/8 MUD HCT recipients (42%, 54%, and 57%, respectively; p=0.009). The corresponding 3-year cumulative incidences of chronic GVHD were similar among the three groups (51%, 49%, and 41%; p=0.25). In multivariate analyses, 8/8 MUD HCT recipients had similar DFS and survival rates compared to MRD HCT recipients (relative risk [RR] 1.11 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.89\u20131.39) and 1.24 (95% CI 0.98\u20131.56), respectively); 7/8 MUD HCT recipients had inferior DFS (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.91) and survival (1.62, 95% CI 1.21\u20132.17) when compared to MRD HCT recipients and when compared to 8/8 MUD HCT recipients (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.00\u20131.65 for DFS and 1.30, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.68 for survival) ( Tables 1 , 2 and Figure ). Differences in outcome were largely related to excess TRM; relapse was not significantly different among the three groups (overall p value=0.33) ( Tables 1 and 2 ). In patients with MDS, transplantation from 8/8 MUD and MRD donors produces similar survival, however, 7/8 MUD HCT is associated with inferior outcomes. Table 1.
