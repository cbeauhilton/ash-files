    "abstract_text": "Background. In the World Health Organization classification system (WHO), Splenic Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma (SMZBCL) is described as an indolent B-cell lymphoma, which generally presents as splenomegaly with involvement of the bone marrow and peripheral blood. The immunophenotype is usually IgM+, IgD+/\u2212, cytoplasmic-Ig\u2212/+, pan B antigens+, CD5\u2212, CD10\u2212, CD23\u2212, CD43\u2212/+ and cyclin D1\u2212. A minority of cases (< 20%) express CD5 antigen. The most frequent cytogenetic aberrations are deletions at 7q22\u2013q32, gains of chromosome 3/3q and involvement of chromosomes 1 and 8. The objective of this study is the genetic characterization of SMZBCL by conventional cytogenetics and FISH. Patients and methods. We present 92 patients with SMZBCL from a multicenter study after being diagnosed morphologically and immunologically. Conventional cytogenetic studies were carried out on lymphoid cells from 72 hour-peripheral blood and/or spleen cultures stimulated with TPA. FISH was performed with centromeric probes from chromosome 3 and 12 and locus specific probes from P53 gene and 7q31 loci. Cross-species color banding FISH (RxFISH) probe was applied in 11 patients and SKY in 4 patients to redefine/confirm G-banding karyotype. Results. A clonal chromosome abnormality was found in 62/92 patients (67%) being identified in 37 (60%) as a complex karyotype. The most frequent recurrent abnormalities were deletions of 7q (30 cases) and gains of chromosome 3 (20 cases). 6/20 cases with gains #3, were gains of 3q arm, in three of them resulting from an unbalanced translocation. Thirteen cases showed rearrangements of 3q without gain of material. The chromosomes most frequently involved were: 7q, 3q, 14q, 8q and 1q (in more than 10 cases). Four cases presented gain of chromosome 3/3q and 7q deletion in the same karyotype. Four novel cytogenetic aberrations involving 14q32 were found in this series: t(6;14)(p12;q32) in two cases, t(14;19)(q32;q13) in two cases and t(10;14)(q24;q32), t(1;14)(q21;q32) and t(9;14)(pter-p22::14q32-14q11::9q22) in one case respectively. Conclusions. -In our series, the most frequent cytogenetic aberration in SMZBCL is a deletion at 7q (48%) and could be considered as a cytogenetic marker of these entity. -Gains of chromosome 3 or partial gains affecting only 3q arm are frequently observed in SMZBCL (32%) being chromosome 3 commonly rearranged. -RxFISH ans SKY techniques help us to define new aberrations not detected by conventional cytogenetics. -We describe translocations involving 14q32 that could help us to identify novel oncogenes related to SMZBCL."
