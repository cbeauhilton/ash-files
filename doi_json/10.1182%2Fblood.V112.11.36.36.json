    "abstract_text": "Four multinational, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy phase III studies (RECORD1, 2, 3 and 4) investigated the oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery. A total of 12,729 patients were randomized to receive oral rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily (od) starting 6\u20138 hours after surgery, or subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg od starting the evening before surgery (RECORD1\u20133), or 30 mg bid starting 12\u201324 hours after wound closure or adequate hemostasis (RECORD4). In both RECORD1 and 2, patients undergoing total hip replacement (THR) were given rivaroxaban for 31\u201339 days. Enoxaparin was given for 31\u201339 days in RECORD1 or 10\u201314 days in RECORD2. In RECORD3 and 4, patients undergoing total knee replacement (TKR) received prophylaxis for 10\u201314 days. All patients were followed up for 30\u201335 days after the last dose of study medication. All outcomes, including symptomatic outcomes, were adjudicated by the same independent, blinded committees for all four studies. In each of the studies, the rivaroxaban regimens tested significantly reduced the incidence of the primary efficacy outcome (total VTE; the composite of any deep vein thrombosis [DVT], non-fatal pulmonary embolism [PE], and all-cause mortality) compared with enoxaparin regimens tested, with similar rates of bleeding in both groups. The rivaroxaban regimens also consistently reduced the incidence of major VTE (the composite of proximal DVT, non-fatal PE, and VTE-related death) in all four trials compared with the enoxaparin regimens tested. This pre-specified pooled analysis was performed on all randomized patients who received at least one dose of double-blind study medication to evaluate the effect of rivaroxaban on the composite of symptomatic VTE (comprising DVT or PE) and death, and bleeding. These primary outcomes were analyzed at day 12\u00b12 in the active treatment pool (i.e. during the enoxaparin-controlled period common to all studies, to allow for unbiased comparison with enoxaparin), and for the total study duration pool (planned treatment period and 30\u201335 days follow-up). The results are shown in the table. Rivaroxaban significantly reduced the incidence of symptomatic VTE and death compared with enoxaparin regimens at day 12\u00b12 (0.47% vs 0.97%; p =0.001) and for the total study duration (0.81% vs 1.63%; p <0.001). Rivaroxaban was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of major bleeding (Table). These data demonstrate that in the regimens tested, rivaroxaban reduced the composite of major clinical outcomes compared with enoxaparin regimens, with no significant increase in the risk of major bleeding in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery.  .
