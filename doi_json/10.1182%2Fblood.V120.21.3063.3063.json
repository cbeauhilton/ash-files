    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3063 Background: Dying mammalian cells release danger signals that stimulate antigen presenting cells (APCs) to promote an immune response. It has been demonstrated that uric acid released from injured cells alerts the immune system to cell death, acts as a danger signal to stimulate cytotoxic T cell responses and that elimination of uric acid in mouse models reduces this immune response (Ref: Nature 2003; 425:516\u2013521). Rasburicase is a recombinant urate-oxidase enzyme that catalyzes oxidation of uric acid into an inactive soluble metabolite and is currently used to prevent tumor lysis syndrome. We hypothesized that rasburicase administered during myeloablative conditioning prior to allogeneic HCT will reduce the serum levels of uric acid and thereby may decrease the incidence of acute GVHD via inhibition of danger signal-mediated activation of host APCs. Methods: In this pilot trial at the Massachusetts General Hospital, between 2007 and 2010, 23 patients (median age: 41 years, range: 19\u201359) with hematologic malignancies in complete remission (AML, n=13; ALL, n=8; MDS, n=1; MPD, n=1;) received myeloablative preparative regimens (Bu/Cy, n=14; Cy/TBI, n=7; Bu/Flu, n=2) followed by GCSF-mobilized HLA-matched (MRD, n=18; MUD, n=5) peripheral blood HCT. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine or tacrolimus and methotrexate for MRD transplants and tacrolimus/MTX and anti-thymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin) for MUD transplants. Rasburicase was administered beginning on the first day of conditioning therapy, at a dose of 0.20 mg/kg intravenously daily for 5 consecutive days. Outcomes were compared to 44 controls at this institution from the same time period identified using retrospective chart review. Patients in the control group received allopurinol during the conditioning as a part of the institutional guidelines. Associations between categorical variables were evaluated using Fisher's exact test. Overall and disease-free survival (OS and DFS) were estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier. Results: The mean serum uric acid concentration was 0.2 mg/dl (range, 0\u20131.7) on 6 consecutive days, beginning the day after the first dose of rasburicase. Engraftment was achieved in all patients, and the median times to neutrophil (at least 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /ul) and platelet engraftment (at least 20 \u00d7 10 9 /ul) were 18 days (range, 7\u201326 \u00d7 10 9 /ul) and 16 days (range, 8\u201357 \u00d7 10 9 /ul), respectively. The only serious toxicity caused by rasburicase was intravascular hemolysis in one patient who was found to have G6PD deficiency; this patient received only 2 doses of rasburicase. Greater than or equal to grade II-IV acute GVHD occurred in 5 out of 23 patients (22%), 4/18 in MRD and 1/5 in MUD recipients: grade II, n=1; grade III, n=2; and grade IV, n=2. When compared with 44 patients (AML 28, ALL 5, MDS 4, NHL 5, MPD 1, CML 1), comparable to rasburicase-treated patients with respect to age, gender, disease status, donor sources, conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis, who received myeloablative HCT (MRD, n=32; MUD, n=12) at the MGH during the same time period as the patients in the rasburicase-treated group, there was significantly less grade II or higher aGVHD in the rasburicase group (rasburicase: 22% vs. institutional control: 48% [total 21/44, 13/32 in MRD and 8/12 MUD recipients], Fisher's exact test, p=0.033). There was no significant difference in the incidence and severity of chronic GVHD between the two groups (rasburicase, 61%, control 48%; Fisher's exact test, p=0.721). At 3 years, there was no significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) between the rasburicase-treated and control groups (DFS: rasburicase vs. control 51.2% vs. 40.4%, p=0.97; OS: rasburicase vs. control 55.3% vs. 44.9%, p=0.88). Conclusion: Rasburicase can be safely administered during myeloablative conditioning, results in a profound lowering of serum uric acid levels and has the potential to reduce the incidence of acute GVHD. Based on these data a prospective randomized phase II trial is planned in order to verify whether rasburicase inhibits acute GVHD after myeloablative HCT and to study the possible mechanisms of protection from GVHD.
