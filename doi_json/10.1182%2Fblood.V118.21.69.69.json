    "abstract_text": "Abstract 69 Infant (< 1 year of age) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a rare disease characterized by rearrangements of the M ixed L ineage L eukemia ( MLL ) gene at 11q23 and a poor prognosis. In an effort to determine the total complement of somatic mutations occurring in this high risk leukemia, we performed paired-end whole genome sequencing (WGS) on diagnostic leukemia blasts and matched germ line samples from 22 infants with MLL rearranged ALL using the Illumina platform. In addition, we sequenced 2 paired relapse samples. Somatic alterations, including single nucleotide variations (SNV), and structural variations (SV) including insertions, deletions, inversion, and inter- and intra-chromosomal rearrangements were detected using complementary analysis pipelines including Bambino, CREST and CONSERTING. Validation of identified somatic mutations was performed using PCR amplification of the leukemia and germ line DNA followed by Sanger or 454-based sequencing, or by array-based capture followed by Illumina-based sequencing. Analysis of the structure of MLL rearrangements at the base pair level revealed that over half had complex rearrangements that involved either three or more chromosomes, or contained at the breakpoints deletions, amplifications, insertions, or inversion of sequences. In five of the complex cases, chromosomal rearrangements were predicted to generate not only a MLL-partner gene fusion, but also novel in-frame fusions including KRAS - MLL ; RAD51B - MLL / AFF1 - RAD51B ; MLLT10 - CTNNAP3B ; MLLT10 - ATP5L / ATP5L-YPEL4 ; and CRTAM - GNL3 . An analysis of the sequence surrounding the breakpoints of MLL and its partner genes suggest that the predominant mechanism of rearrangement involved non-homologous end joining. An analysis of the total number of non-silent mutations revealed infant ALL to have the lowest frequency of non-silent somatic mutations of any cancer sequenced to date. After removal of SVs and CNAs associated with the MLL rearrangements, a mean of only 2 somatic SVs and 2 SNVs affecting the coding region of annotated genes or regulatory RNAs were detected per case, with a range of non-silent mutation of between 0 and 11 per case (0\u20137 SV and 0\u20135 SNV). Despite the paucity of mutations several pathways were recurrently targeted. Mutations leading to activation of signaling through the PI3K/RAS pathway was observed in 45% of the cases with mutation of individual components including KRAS (n=4), NRAS (n=2), and non-recurrent mutations in NF1 , PTPN11 , PIK3R1 , and the GTPase activating protein ARHGAP32 (p200Rho/GAP), which mediates cross-talk between RAS and Rho signaling. Other pathways altered include B cell differentiation, with 23% of cases containing mono-allelic deletion or gains of PAX5 , 14% with deletions of the CDKN2A/B , and 2 cases with focal deletions of the non-coding RNA genes DLEU1/2 . WGS of two infant ALL relapse samples and comparison with the data from their matched diagnostic samples revealed a marked increase in the number of mutations at relapse with additional SVs, SNVs, and CNAs identified. Moreover, an analysis of the allelic ratios of mutated genes revealed clonal heterogeneity at diagnosis with relapse appearing to arise from a minor diagnostic clone. Because of the exceedingly low frequency of mutations detected in infant ALL, we decided to define the frequency of non-silent SNVs in MLL rearranged leukemia occurring in older children (7\u201319 years of age). Exome sequencing was performed on 13 MLL leukemias (8 ALLs and 5 AMLs). This analysis revealed that non-infant pediatric MLL rearranged leukemias harbor a significantly higher number of non-silent somatic SNVs than infant ALL (mean 8/case in older patients versus 2/case in infants, p<0.001). Although the increased frequency of mutations may be a reflection of the older age, the low number of cooperating mutations in infants raises the possibility that the target cell of transformation differs between infants and older children, with the cells present during early development requiring fewer cooperating mutations to induce leukemia. In summary our analysis demonstrated an exceedingly small number of mutations required to generate infant MLL rearranged leukemia. The number of detected somatic mutations may represent the lower limit of mutations required to transform a normal human cell into cancer.
