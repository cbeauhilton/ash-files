    "abstract_text": "Some patients with hemochromatosis (HC) experience fatigue, heart failure or arrhythmias, diabetes mellitus, liver damage, impotence, or arthritis. We examined self-reported symptoms and clinical conditions in persons homozygous for HFE C282Y, the major HC-associated gene mutation, identified in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study, a multi-center, multi-ethnic study in which 101,168 adults were recruited from primary care settings. Non-Hispanic Caucasian C282Y homozygotes were compared to participants without HFE C282Y or H63D alleles (controls) with transferrin saturation (TfS) and serum ferritin (SF) levels in the middle half of gender-specific distributions. Evaluation included a medical history, focused physical examination, and repeat SF. Among 44,082 non-Hispanic Caucasian participants screened at five Field Centers in the United States and Canada, 282 persons homozygous for C282Y were identified, comprising three groups: newly-diagnosed cases with normal (N=64) or elevated (N=131) SF (>200 \u03bcg/L in women, >300 \u03bcg/L in men), and previously-diagnosed cases (N=87). There were 364 non-Hispanic Caucasian controls. Significant differences were observed for six of 38 outcomes. Previously diagnosed C282Y homozygotes and newly diagnosed homozygotes with elevated SF reported significantly more chronic fatigue than controls (p=0.002). All groups of C282Y homozygotes reported weight loss more often than controls (p<0.001). Excessive thirst was reported more often than controls by newly diagnosed C282Y homozygotes, regardless of SF level (p=0.004), but there was no difference in self-reported history of diabetes. Joint stiffness was more common among newly diagnosed C282Y homozygotes with elevated SF than among control subjects (p<0.001). Swelling or tenderness of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints and increased pigmentation were also more common among previously diagnosed C282Y homozygotes and newly diagnosed homozygotes with elevated SF than among controls (p=0.001 and p=0.002, respectively). The prevalences of manifestations related to liver or heart disease among C282Y homozygotes were not significantly different from controls. There were no differences among the three groups of C282Y homozygotes in the prevalences of any symptoms or clinical conditions. In summary, some symptoms and conditions associated with HC were more prevalent among C282Y homozygotes than among controls. However, C282Y homozygotes identified by screening in primary care settings did not have a higher prevalence of most symptoms and signs associated with HC than control subjects."
