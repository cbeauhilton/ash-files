    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by proliferation of plasma cell, mostly in the bone marrow. It is established that cytokines including IL-6 play a key role as growth and survival factor for plasma cells through the specific receptors on the cell surface. Abnormalities of chromosome 1q have frequently been reported in various cancers as well as multiple myeloma (MM). Recent studies suggest that amplification of chromosome 1q is a negative prognostic factor. To determine whether increase of the IL-6 receptors located at chromosome 1q21 stimulate secretion of cytokine IL-6 we performed a gene expression evaluation on 136 newly-diagnosed MM, analyzed by interphase FISH for IL-6R(1q21) amplification, Rb1(13q14) deletion, and IGH translocation and additional copies of 9,17,20. We found that the correlation of IL-6R gene and other major genetic risk factor in MM. IL-6R gene amplification (3 to 12 orange signal) was detected in 46 of 136 (34%). These results indicate that IL-6R gene occur the gain of chromosome 1q. It is suggest that the identification of interleukin-6 receptor associated with 1q amplification is useful in providing diagnostic information on multiple myeloma.",
