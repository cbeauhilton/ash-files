    "abstract_text": "Background Bortezomib (BTZ) is highly effective in the treatment of multiple myeloma; however, emergent drug resistance is common. The underlying mechanisms of such proteasome inhibitor resistance are still incompletely understood. Methods To further understand its resistant mechanism, we generated eight multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines resistant to bortezomib (BTZ) by exposure to increasing drug concentration: five of them acquired novel PSMB5 mutations. Given the rarity of similar mutations in over 1,500 analyzed MM patients, we explored in depth the role of the proteasome on MM cell viability and BTZ sensitivity by systematically deleting the major proteasome targets of BTZ by CRISPR. Results We demonstrated that MM cell lines without PSMB5 were surprisingly viable (mutation corresponding yeast gene pre2 is lethal). PSMB5 mutated, BTZ resistant, MM cell lines were re-sensitized to BTZ when PSMB5 was experimentally deleted, implying that this mutation is activating in its drug resistance function. In contrast PSMB6 knockout was lethal to MM cell lines, which were efficiently rescued by re-introduction of wild type PSMB6. Interestingly, reduction in PSMB6 levels also prevented the splicing of the major catalytic subunits PSMB5, PSMB7, PSMB8 and PSMB10. PSMB6 engineered with no splicing function or catalytic activity, also restored viability, inferring that the contribution of PSMB6 to proteasome structure is more important than functional activity. Supporting this observation, BTZ sensitivity was restored in resistant MM cells line by introducing low level expression of mutated PSMB6 lacking splicing function. As with PSMB6, PSMB7 knockout was lethal to MM cell lines. In contrast, loss of immunoproteasome subunits PSMB8 and PSMB9 was neither lethal nor restored sensitivity to BTZ. Our results demonstrate that expression of the three constitutive proteasome subunits PSMB5, PSMB6 and PSMB7 is highly co-dependent. This dependence is relying on the structure, but not the function, of PSMB5 and PSMB6. Conclusions In summary, PSMB5 and PSMB6, but not PSMB8 and PSMB9, are highly relevant for BTZ sensitivity in MM. Absence of PSMB6 or PSMB7, but not PSMB5, was lethal in MM cell lines. Expression of PSMB5, PSMB6 and PSMB7 was highly co-dependent. Together these findings suggest that the modulation of expression rather than function of PSMB5, PSMB6 or PSMB7 may be a new therapeutic strategy.
