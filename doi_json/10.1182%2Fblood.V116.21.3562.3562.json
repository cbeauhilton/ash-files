    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3562 Aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of a large series of younger patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM) who were enrolled in two subsequent clinical trials of thalidomide-dexamethasone (thal-dex) incorporated into double autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) to support high-dose melphalan (200 mg/m2). In both studies, thal (100 mg/day for the first 14 days and then 200 mg/day) and pulsed dex (between 480 and 160 mg per cycle), were administered from the onset until the second ASCT. The analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis on a total of 593 patients who were followed for a median of 36 months. The best VGPR and CR rates were 69% and 35%, respectively. The median duration of CR was 66 months. Median TTP and PFS were 53 and 44 months, respectively. The 5-year projected rates of TTP and PFS were 46% and 38%, respectively, while the corresponding value for OS was 67%. More than 80% of the patients were screened at diagnosis for the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities by FISH analysis. Forty-five percent of patients had del(13q), while t(4;14) and del(17p) were found in 16 % and 7 % of patients, respectively. The presence of del(17p) and/or t(4;14) was associated with a significantly shorter 5-year projected TTP, PFS and OS in comparison with the absence of these abnormalities, indifferently from the presence or absence of del(13q) (TTP: 30% vs 53%, respectively P=0.0000; PFS: 28% vs 45%, respectively, P=0.0000; OS: 53% vs 69%, respectively, P=0.0000). OS and PFS curves of patients carrying del(13q) alone were almost superimposable to those of patients without cytogenetic abnormalities, while TTP was significantly shorter for patients with del(13q) alone (5-year projected rates: 40% vs 53%, respectively, P=0.04). Patients carrying del(17p) in the absence of t(4;14) had similar 5-year projected TTP and PFS as compared with t(4;14) positive but del(17p) negative patients. However, OS was significantly shorter for the subgroup with del(17p) and absence of t(4;14) in comparison with that of patients carrying t(4;14) without del(17p) (5 year projected rates: 18% vs 70%, respectively, P=0.03). In a multivariate analysis, presence of del(17p) and high beta2-m at baseline were the most important variables adversely influencing TTP (HR: 2.3, P=0.001 and HR: 1.8, P=0.002, respectively), PFS (HR: 2.0, P=0.001 and HR: 1.9, P=0.001, respectively), and OS (HR: 3.9, P=0.000 and HR: 2.0, P=0.005, respectively). Additional variables predicting for shorter TTP and PFS were the presence of t(4;14) (HR: 1.8, P=0.004) and of del(13q) (HR: 1.6, P= 0.009). Also the quality of best response to the overall treatment program influenced clinical outcomes. In particular, patients achieving CR had a significantly longer PFS and OS than those achieving a VGPR (PFS: median 68 vs 40 months, respectively, P=0.007; 5-year projected OS rates: 84% vs 70%, respectively, P=0.01). In conclusion, incorporation of thal-dex into double autotransplantation failed to overcome the poor prognosis conferred by del(13 q), t(4;14) and del(17p). In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, del(17p) and high levels of serum beta2-m at diagnosis were the strongest variables adversely influencing PFS and OS. In comparison with the presence of t(4;14) but absence of del(17p), patients carrying del(17p) without t(4;14) had a significantly shorter OS, possibly due to their worst outcome after relapse. Presence of del(13q) alone conferred a significantly shorter TTP, but did not have an adverse impact on OS due to the favorable role of effective salvage therapies incorporating either bortezomib or lenalidomide.
