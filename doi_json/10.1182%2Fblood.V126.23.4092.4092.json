    "abstract_text": "Background: Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a rare myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the accumulation of neoplastic mast cells (MC) in one or more extracutaneous organs. In all forms of SM, anti-mediator drugs are used to control symptoms of MC degranulation. In advanced forms of SM, organ damage is common and patients (pts) exhibit reduced life expectancy. In these individuals, cytoreductive agents such as cladribine and interferon-alpha have been used off-label, and inhibitors of KIT D816V are under investigation. A significant unmet need exists for these patients. Siglec-8 is an inhibitory receptor of the CD33-related family of sialic acid-binding, Ig-like lectins (Siglecs) that is expressed selectively on the surface of mature MC, eosinophils, and basophils. Engagement of Siglec-8 with monoclonal antibodies has been previously shown to inhibit IgE-mediated MC degranulation and to induce apoptosis of cytokine-activated eosinophils. Thus this receptor is a potential target for antibody therapy of SM with or without associated eosinophilia. Anti-Siglec-8 antibodies do not directly affect MC viability but antibodies with effector function can induce antibody cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Here we show that a recombinant anti-Siglec-8 IgG1 monoclonal antibody can elicit ADCC activity against MC derived from SM patients ex vivo. Methods: Bone marrow (BM) aspirates from SM patients were evaluated for Siglec-8 cell-surface expression on CD117 + Fc\u03b5RI + MC or CD25 + MC by flow cytometry. For ADCC assays, BM MC enriched using CD117-targeting magnetic beads or a Siglec-8 transfected Ramos cell line were used as target cells. Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) or NK cells purified from peripheral blood were used as effector cells at an effector:target ratio of 10:1. Recombinant anti-Siglec-8 antibody or an isotype control antibody was added at various concentrations and the percent viable CD117 + Fc\u03b5RI + MC remaining after 48 hours of culture was determined by flow cytometry. Results: Samples from 9 pts with SM were included in the analysis (ISM, n=1; SSM, n=1; SM-CMML, n=3; SM-MDS, n=1; SM-CEL, n=1; ASM, n=1; MCL, n=1). Eight pts were KIT D816V positive. At the time of sample collection, treatments included midostaurin (n=3); cladribine (n=1); corticosteroids (n=1); and 4 pts were not receiving any biologic or cytoreductive therapy. All BM samples showed detectable CD117 + MC. Robust and selective cell-surface expression of Siglec-8 was observed in all 6 cases evaluated and 100% of CD117 + Fc\u03b5RI + MC were Siglec-8 positive by FACS, including CD25 + MC. Levels of Siglec-8 were comparable to or higher than levels on mature MC isolated from normal skin. In this limited sample size, no difference in Siglec-8 expression was observed between patients receiving different therapies or no therapy. To evaluate the ADCC activity of recombinant anti-Siglec-8 antibody on MC, enriched BM MC were incubated with anti-Siglec-8 antibody or isotype-matched control antibody at 1 \u03bcg/ mL in the presence of purified NK effector cells. In two patients evaluated, significant anti-Siglec-8-mediated ADCC activity on MC was observed using non-autologous NK cells (69% reduction, 1 pt) or autologous NK cells (76% reduction, 1 pt) indicating that anti-Siglec-8 has the potential to reduce MC burden in these patients. ADCC activity has been reported to be defective in some cancer patients. To evaluate the ability of effector cells in SM patients to mediate ADCC, an assay was developed using a Siglec-8 transfected target cell line to screen blood samples for ADCC activity induced by anti-Siglec-8 antibody. Using PBL as effector cells, ADCC was observed in all samples tested (5/5). Titration of antibody was performed on 2 samples and potent ADCC activity was observed in both, with an EC 50 for target depletion of 49 and 65 ng/mL of anti-Siglec-8 antibody, respectively. Conclusion: These data provide a strong rationale for evaluating the effect of an antibody to Siglec-8 with ADCC activity in patients with SM.
