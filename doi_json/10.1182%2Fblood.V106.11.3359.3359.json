    "abstract_text": "The two subunits of core binding factor (RUNX1 and CBF\u03b2) play critical roles in hematopoiesis and are frequent targets of chromosomal translocations found in leukemia. CBF\u03b2 functions to increase the DNA-binding of the RUNX1 subunit 20\u201340 fold and to protect the Runx1 subunit against ubiqitination and subsequent proteasome degradation, making this protein-protein interaction critical for CBF function. Two of the most common translocations involving the subunits of CBF are the inv(16) and the t(8;21) which produce the chimeric proteins CBF\u03b2-SMMHC and AML1-ETO, respectively. We are characterizing both the structures and biochemical properties of these translocation products to gain insights into their function and provide novel avenues for therapeutic development. The inv(16) results in the fusion of the N-terminal 165 amino acids of CBF\u03b2 to the coiled-coil region of smooth muscle myosin protein. The CBF\u03b2-SMMHC fusion protein causes dysregulation of CBF function by means of anomalously tight binding to RUNX1. As there is still one copy of the normal CBF\u03b2 present in those leukemic cells harboring the inv(16), inhibition of CBF\u03b2-SMMHC may enable the wildtype CBF\u03b2 to restore normal CBF function. Since binding to RUNX1 is required for the dysfunction associated with this protein, this binding represents an excellent target for inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy. A small molecule inhibitor of this kind has the potential to be a useful and highly specific therapeutic agent. As an initial step in this direction, we have developed small molecules which bind to CBF\u03b2 and inhibit RUNX1 binding. This represents the first step toward our overall goal of developing compounds which can specifically inhibit CBF\u03b2-SMMHC while minimally perturbing the activity of CBF\u03b2 itself. We previously solved the 3D structure of CBF\u03b2 using solution NMR methods and mapped the binding interface with RUNX1 by both chemical shift perturbation as well as Ala mutagenesis of the binding interface. Using this data, we employed virtual screening of CBF\u03b2 and experimental screening with NMR spectroscopy and FRET to identify initial lead compounds that could bind to CBF\u03b2 and inhibit its interaction with the RUNX1 Runt domain. Using a traditional medicinal chemistry approach, we have elaborated these compounds to identify structure-activity relationships (SAR). Based on the SAR results and NMR-based docking of the compounds to CBF\u03b2, we have optimized the initial leads to generate compounds with low micromolar affinity which effectively inhibit the binding of RUNX1 to CBF\u03b2. These compounds represent the first small molecule inhibitors of this protein-protein interaction. These compounds demonstrate activity in a protein localization assay in mammalian cells with no generalized toxicity, indicating they are good leads for further development. NMR-based docking of these molecules to CBF\u03b2 shows these compounds bind at a site displaced from the binding interface for RUNX1 on CBF\u03b2, i.e. these compounds function as allosteric inhibitors of this protein-protein interaction, an approach which may be generalizable to other protein-protein interactions. We are pursuing several approaches to modify these compounds to achieve selective inhibition of CBF\u03b2-SMMHC with minimal perturbation of native CBF\u03b2 activity.",
