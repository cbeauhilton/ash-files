    "abstract_text": "Background : Recent studies highlight immunoregulatory functions of type I interferons (IFN-I) during the pathogenesis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). We demonstrated that selective activation of IFN-I pathways including RIG-I/MAVS and cGAS/STING prior to allo-HSCT conditioning therapy can ameliorate the course of GVHD. However, direct effects of IFN-Is on immune cells remain ill characterised. Methods : We applied selective RIG-I agonists (3pRNA) to stimulate IFN-I production in murine models of conditioning therapy with total body irradiation (TBI) and GVHD . Results: Using IFNAR1-deficient donor T and hematopoietic donor cells, we found that endogenous and RIG-I-induced IFN-Is do not reduce GVHD by acting on these respective cell types. However, 3pRNA applied before conditioning therapy reduced the ability of CD11c + recipient cells to stimulate proliferation and interferon gamma expression of allogeneic T cells. Consistently, RIG-I activation before TBI reduced the proliferation of transplanted T-cells after allo-HSCT. The reduced allogenicity of CD11c + recipient cells was dependent on IFN-I signalling. Notably, this immunosuppressive function of DCs was restricted to a scenario of genotoxic tissue damage as neither RIG-I activation and IFN-I induction in naive (non-irradiated) mice altered allogeneic T cell activation. Conclusion : Our findings uncover a hitherto unknown IFN-I- and context dependent immunosuppressive function of dendritic cells. This needs to be considered in the development of IFN-I based therapeutic approaches to modulate donor T cell activation after allo-HSCT.
