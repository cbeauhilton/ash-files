    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3680 Background: Current NHL radioimmunotherapy is administered with unlabeled antibody targeting the same B-cell antigen. This decreases sequestration of the radiolabeled antibody by normal B-lymphocytes, but potentially blocks access of the radiolabeled antibody to the tumor sites. In clinical studies, yttrium-90 radiolabeled anti-CD22 epratuzumab ( 90 Y-epratuzumab) has demonstrated therapeutic activity with acceptable toxicity when given weekly \u00d7 2 at doses up to 20 mCi/m 2 (Morschhauser et al., J Clin Oncol. 2010;28:3709\u201316), while separate studies showed that a 200-mg/m 2 dose of anti-CD20 veltuzumab given weekly \u00d7 4 readily depletes peripheral blood B-cells and is also therapeutically active (Morschhauser et al., J Clin Oncol , 2009;27:3346\u201353). In mice bearing human B-cell lymphoma xenografts, this non-competing combination showed improved therapeutic responses over either agent alone (Mattes et al., Clin Cancer Res. 2008;14:6154\u201360). As such, a multicenter, phase I/II study was undertaken to evaluate combination therapy with 90 Y-epratuzumab and veltuzumab. Methods: Adult patients with aggressive NHL who failed \u2265 1 prior standard regimen (excluding autologous SCT) were eligible if they had measurable CT lesions, ECOG 0\u20131 performance status, <25% bone marrow involvement, hemoglobin \u2265 10 g/dL, ANC \u2265 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L, platelets \u2265 100 \u00d7 10 9 /L and were >4 weeks beyond last treatment. All patients received a 4-week treatment regimen (weekly 200 mg/m 2 veltuzumab, 3\u20135 mCi 111 In-epratuzumab on week 2, 90 Y-epratuzumab on weeks 3 and 4). Using NCI CTCAE v4.0 toxicity criteria, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as Grade 4 hemoglobin, platelet or neutrophil levels >7 days or not recovered to Grade 1 by 12 weeks, or any non-hematologic Grade 3 or 4 events. Starting at 15 mCi/m 2 , a standard 3+3 dose escalation determined the MTD of 90 Y-epratuzumab. Treatment response utilized CT-based 2007 IWG revised criteria. Serial 111 In imaging and serum samples were used to assess biodistribution, tumor targeting and determine normal organ radiation dosimetry. ELISA-based assays were used to measure veltuzumab pharmacokinetics and any human anti-veltuzumab antibodies (HAHA). Results: Fifteen patients (10 male/5 female, 56 \u2013 84 years old) with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL N=7), transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL, N=4) or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL, N=4) have now been enrolled. They had 3 median prior treatments (1 \u2013 7) [RCHOP (N=15); bendamustine plus rituximab (N=5); ICE, lenalidomide, bortezomib (N=2 each); others (1 each)] and had low (N=3), low-intermediate (N=3), high-intermediate (N=7), or high (N=2) IPI risk scores. Treatment was well-tolerated with no infusion reactions. 111 In-imaging showed normal biodistribution, with acceptable normal organ dosimetry for the scheduled 90 Y dose, and tumor targeting occasionally visualized. There was no evidence of HAHA, and the serum clearance of veltuzumab and 111 In-epratzumab in combination was comparable to that reported previously for these agents alone. The 90 Y dose was repeatedly de-escalated from 15 (N=3) to 12 (N=3), 9 (N=6), and currently 6 (N=3) mCi/m 2 due to 7 hematologic DLTs at \u2265 9 mCi/m 2 in 6 patients involving Grade 3-thrombocytopenia (N=5) or neutropenia (N=2). Clinically, there were 3 SAEs (pneumonia, non-infectious pneumonitis, fracture from fall), but no other major infections or bleeding. Of 11 patients who have now had treatment response assessments, 5 (45%) had objective responses, including one DLCBL patient with a complete response (CR) continuing 12 months later and 4 patients (1 DLBCL, 3 TFL) with partial responses (PRs), with one continuing at 4 weeks and 3 relapsed at 3 \u2013 6 months. Four other patients (1 DLBCL, 3 MCL) achieved stable disease (SD) continuing up to 6 months as best response, resulting in a disease control rate of 82% (CR+PR+SD). Conclusions: Combination treatment was well-tolerated, with the PK behavior of the two agents substantially unchanged, and with initial evidence of therapeutic activity (including one durable CR) in these difficult-to-treat patients. Hematologic toxicity necessitated lowering the 90 Y dose, most likely due to the prior aggressive chemotherapies or depletion of the normal sequestering B-cell pool by veltuzumab preceding 90 Y-epratzumab. The trial is continuing to determine an acceptable 90 Y dose and define the safety and efficacy profile of this combination approach. Disclosures: Sharkey: Immunomedics: Employment.
