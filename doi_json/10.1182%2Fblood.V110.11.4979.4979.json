    "abstract_text": "Background: Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is an important risk factor for predicting chronic GVHD. The transplant outcome can be influenced by the onset time of acute GVHD in patients who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) Methods: The medical records of one hundred six patients with hematological malignancies who received allogeneic transplantation were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Fifty four (39.7%) patients developed grade II to IV acute GVHD within D+30 after allogeneic SCT (<D+30 group) and 13 (9.6%) patients manifested acute GVHD after D+30 (\u2265D+30 group). The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 81.5% and 53.8% in <D+30 group and \u2265D+30 group, respectively.(p<0.001) On multivariate analysis, grade II to IV acute GVHD developed before D+30 and primary diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia were identified as independent variables predicting chronic GVHD. The overall survival rate was significantly lower in the <D+30 group than grade 0 or I group (p<0.001). But there was no statistical difference between the group with grade 0 or I and \u2265D+30 group in terms of the incidence of chronic GVHD (p=0.295). Among the 54 patients with grade II to IV acute GVHD developed at before D+30, 26 (48.1%) patients developed into quiescent chronic GVHD and 20 (37%) patients progressive chronic GVHD. The quiescent chronic GVHD showed a better survival than progressive chronic GVHD (p=0.063). Conclusion: Acute GVHD of early onset (within D+30) was regarded as a worse prognostic indicator in terms of chronic GVHD and survival.",
