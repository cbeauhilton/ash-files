    "abstract_text": "Background: Depression and anxiety are associated with poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL), lower functioning and decreased treatment adherence. In 2019, 7% adults in the US had moderate/severe symptoms of depression, while <5% had anxiety. Impacts of depression and anxiety in persons with von Willebrand disease (VWD) are unclear and less studied. Objective: We assessed sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with depression and anxiety in a geographically diverse cohort of individuals with VWD obtaining care at seven US Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTCs). Methods: The study enrolled and collected data on individuals age \u226512 with VWD Type 1 (VWF:Ag/RCo: \u226430%), low VWF(VWF:Ag/RCo: 30-50%), Type 2, and type 3 between September 2018-June 2021. Participants completed a survey at enrollment to collect sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, self-reported pain, joint problems and HRQoL measured by the EQ-5D-3L. A quarterly survey administered one year post-enrollment collected similar data. The patient health questionnaire (PHQ-8) and the generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) were administered with the last follow-up survey after August 2019. Chart reviews abstracted VWD type information. The association of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics with depression or anxiety was assessed using Chi-square tests for categorical variables, as well as logistic regression models with stepwise selection. Results: We analyzed data from 77 participants who completed both baseline and last follow-up surveys. Mean age was 34.2 (standard deviation (SD)=18.8) years, 74.0% were adults \u226518 years, 79.2% were female, 60.8% had Type 1/low VWF, and 3.9% had Type 3 VWD. Mean age at VWD diagnosis was 13.9 (SD=13.2) years. Overall reported depression rate was 63.4%, and 58.3% for anxiety (values \u226510 on either PHQ-8 or GAD-7). Proportion of those with depression (75% vs. 62%) or anxiety (58% vs. 58%) prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic were not significantly different. Persons with low VWF had higher rates of depression (86.7%) or anxiety (69.2%) as compared to those with type 1 VWD (55.3% for depression, 52.8% for anxiety) or types 2 and 3 (62.5%, 60.9%, p=0.10, not significant (NS) for depression and p=0.56, NS for anxiety, respectively). Females reported a higher rate of anxiety (61.4%) than males (46.7%, p=0.30, NS). When compared to individuals who rated their general health as the same or better than 3-months ago, those who rated their health as worse had significantly higher rates of depression (92.3% vs. 57.8%, p=0.02) and anxiety (83.3% vs. 53.3%, p=0.05). Participants with chronic pain reported a significantly higher depression rate (81.6% vs. 36.8%, p=0.0003). Those who reported having joint problems also reported depression at a significantly higher rate (82.4% vs. 48.8%, p=0.002) or anxiety (74.1% vs. 46.3%, p=0.02) than those without joint problems. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that among adults or parents of pediatric patients, being single or not with a partner was the most important variable associated with depression (odds ratio (OR)=7.0, confidence interval (CI): 1.7-29.0), followed by having joint problems (OR=6.3, CI=2.0-20.1). The most important variable associated with anxiety was being a youth aged 12-18 years old (OR=6.7, CI=1.6-26.9), followed by being single or not with a partner (OR=10.8, CI=2.5-47.5), or having worse health compared to 3-months prior (OR=12.3, CI=1.3-116.2). Mean covariates adjusted EQ index scores were lower among persons with depression (0.75\u00b1standard error (SE) 0.03 vs. 0.83\u00b10.04, p=0.06 NS) or anxiety (0.75\u00b10.03 vs. 0.82\u00b10.04, p=0.7 NS) than among those without depression or anxiety. As compared to individuals without depression or anxiety, mean covariates adjusted EQ VAS was significantly lower in persons with depression (68.7\u00b13.1 vs. 77.6\u00b14.2, p=0.03), but not among those with anxiety (69.3\u00b13.7 vs. 71.3\u00b14.3, p=0.66 NS). Conclusions: Our study revealed higher rates of major depression and anxiety in this VWD sample than the general US population. Depression had a significant negative impact on HRQoL. Mental health screening is imperative for persons with VWD, especially those with low VWF, chronic pain or joint problems. Special attention should be paid to women and youth. This study underscores the need for a multidisciplinary approach in the comprehensive care of patients seen at HTCs.
