    "abstract_text": "We analyzed the prognostic impact of the most frequent genetic abnormalities detected by fluorescence-in situ-hybridization combined with immunofluorescent cytoplasm immunoglobulin staining (cIg-FISH) in 101 patients with multiple myeloma, who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation after reduced melphalan/fludarabine-based conditioning from related (n=34) and unrelated (n=67) donors. The abnormalities were del(13q14) [62%], t(11;14)(q13;q32) [11%], t(4;14)(p16.3;q32) [16%], CMYC-gains (8q24) [17%], del(17p13.1) [16%], t(14;16)(q32;q23) [4%], whereas none of the patients had t(6;14)(p25;q32). Translocation t(4;14), CMYC-gains and del 17p were frequently associated with del(13q14): 64%, 80% and 92%, respectively. The complete remission (CR) rate was 45% for all patients. Patients with del(17p13) achieved fewer complete remission than others (7% vs. 56%; p=0.001), while no difference was seen for t(4;14) and other abnormalities. Univariate analysis revealed higher relapse rates for age > 50 years (p=0.002), del(13q14) (p=0.006) and del(17p13) (p=0.003). Patients with translocation t (4;14) had a similar four year event-free survival than others (50 vs 45%). In a multivariate analysis, only del(13q14) [HR: 2.34, p=0.03] and del(17p13) [HR: 2.24; p=0.04] influenced the risk of relapse, while for event-free survival, only age [HR 2.8; p=0.01] and del(17p13) [HR: 2.05; p=0.03] retained the prognostic value. These data seem to indicate that some adverse cytogenetic risk factors such as t(4;14) can be overcome by allogeneic stem cell transplantation, probably due to the graft versus myeloma effect. Del(17p13.1) is a significant factor for a lower chance of complete remissions and shorter event free survival following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The presented data will have implications for risk-adapted strategies in the future.",
