    "abstract_text": "The preceding trial HD9 had shown a significant superiority for escalated BEACOPP (EB) for failure-free survival (FFTF) and overall survival (OS) over COPP/ABVD or baseline BEACOPP (BB) (each 8 cycles). HD12 aimed to de-escalate chemotherapy by comparing 8 cycles EB with 4 cycles EB plus 4 cycles BB, with or without consolidatory 30 Gy radiation (RT) to initial bulky and residual disease. A total of 1661 patients aged 16\u201365 with HL in stage IIB (large mediastinal mass and/or E-lesions) or stage III-IV were randomised from 9/1999-1/2003 according to a factorial design between: 8EB + RT, 8EB no RT, 4EB+4BB + RT, 4EB+4BB no RT. A central diagnostic panel reviewed CT images after completion of chemotherapy independent of randomisation arm, and prescribed RT in selected cases. In the fifth analysis of HD12 (5/2006), 94% of all 1593 eligible randomised patients were evaluable, including 1498 for the chemotherapy comparison and 1449 for the radiotherapy comparison. Patient characteristics were very similar for all 4 arms. Radiation was given in arms with planned RT in 65%, in arms with no planned RT in 10%. 93% of all patients reached a complete remission, 2.2% suffered early progression, 4.6% relapsed and 8.2% died with a median folllow-up time of 48 months. Death due to acute toxicity was 3.2% (sepsis, cardiac, pulmonary, infection), with 21 such deaths in the 8EB arms and 27 in the 4EB+4BB arms. Secondary neoplasias were observed in 55 patients (3.7%): 14 AML/MDS, 12 NHL and 29 solid tumors/others. Four-year Kaplan-Meier estimates for arm pairs according to the factorial design were:  4 year rates, %(95% CI) 8EB vs. 4EB+4BB with RT vs. without RT FFTF 88(86\u201391) 86(83\u201389) 91(89\u201393) 88(86\u201391) OS 93(91\u201395) 91(89\u201393)  4 year rates, %(95% CI) 8EB vs. 4EB+4BB with RT vs. without RT FFTF 88(86\u201391) 86(83\u201389) 91(89\u201393) 88(86\u201391) OS 93(91\u201395) 91(89\u201393)  View Large No significant differences were observed when comparing treatments according to the sequential analysis plan (N.B. 10% received RT in arms \u2018without RT\u2019). The final analysis, scheduled when 80% of patients have 5 years follow-up, must be awaited before final conclusions can be drawn."
