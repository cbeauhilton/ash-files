    "abstract_text": "Background: Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) accounts for approximately 5% of all Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) cases. One hallmark of NLPHL is the consistent expression of CD20 on the malignant lymphocyte predominant (LP) cells. To shed more light on the role of anti-CD20 antibody treatment in relapsed NLPHL, we conducted a phase II study evaluating the fully humanized anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab in 28 patients. Treatment consisted of 8 weekly doses (week 1: 300 mg, week 2-8: 1000 mg) of the antibody. Results: The median age of study patients was 45 years (range: 22-68) and the majority were male (64%). A median of 1 line of therapy (range: 1-5) had been applied prior to study treatment and 7/28 patients (25%) already had rituximab-containing treatment. At the final restaging 3 months after the end of treatment, response was documented in 27/28 patients (96%; 95%-CI: 84%-100%). After a median follow-up of 26 months, 1-year and 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) estimates were 93% and 80%, respectively. No patient died. Transformation into aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) occurred in 2/28 patients (7.1%). No grade III/IV toxic events were observed. Conclusion: In summary, the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab represents a highly active and well tolerated treatment option in relapsed NLPHL. Longer follow-up is required for final conclusions.
