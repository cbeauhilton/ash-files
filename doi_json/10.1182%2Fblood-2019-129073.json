    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) give rise to all cells of the hematopoietic system and are classically defined by their ability to stably engraft and reconstitute the blood system of ablated recipients after transplantation. The first transplantable HSCs arise from hemogenic endothelium at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) of mouse development and migrate to the fetal liver (FL), where they undergo a robust expansion followed by a second migration to the fetal bone marrow (FBM) at E15.5. The dynamics of hematopoiesis within the FBM has been largely unexplored. To gain a better understanding of FBM hematopoiesis, we catalogued the frequency, absolute numbers, phenotype and function of HSPCs in murine FBM from E15.5 through post-natal day 28 (P28). To avoid assumptions regarding HSPC location during fetal and neonatal development, we pooled bone marrow from the entire fetal skeleton for these studies. HSCs were rare in the FBM, ranging from 70-150 total HSCs at E15.5-E17.5, followed by a burst at E18.5 to 2,200 total HSCs. The frequency and absolute number of HSCs in the bone marrow steadily increased from E18.5 to P6, followed by a continual increase in the absolute number of HSCs from P6 to adulthood. This may reflect the dynamics of HSC cycling, or an influx or expansion of more differentiated progenitors in the fetal and neonatal bone marrow. We also found that the most prevalent hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) population within Lineage-Sca-1+c-Kit+ (LSK) cells in E15.5-E18.5 FBM was Flt3-CD48+CD150+ cells (MPP2). MPP2 cells, which are a megakaryocyte-biased multipotent progenitor population, comprised up to 75% of the LSK compartment at these time points, compared to 3% in adult bone marrow. The percentage of MPP2 cells dropped abruptly and dramatically right before birth ( e.g. to 17% at E19) and continued to drop until adulthood. Transplantation of limiting numbers of MPP2 cells revealed that E16.5, E18.5, and P0 MPP2s displayed no repopulating potential, while adult MPP2s showed transient reconstitution of irradiated recipients. Fetal bone marrow MPPs displayed no colony potential in single-cell methylcellulose colony assays until E18.5 and P0, with a bias for erythroid-megakaryocyte colonies. Therefore, fetal bone marrow MPP2s are functionally distinct from their adult counterparts. Whole fetal bone marrow transplants showed that the first transplantable FBM HSCs appeared at E16.5, with up to 75% reconstitution in the peripheral blood (PB) of irradiated recipients. E16.5 FBM HSCs also displayed secondary transplantation activity, while E15.5 FBM HSCs displayed limited ability to reconstitute the PB of primary recipients. In sum, our studies reveal that until birth the predominant HSPC population in the fetal bone marrow is an immunophenotypic MPP2 that is functionally distinct from adult MPP2s, and that HSCs do not begin to accumulate in significant numbers until right before birth. These studies suggest the presence of key mechanisms during birth that influence the HSPC landscape of the fetal and neonatal bone marrow, and work is currently underway to systematically characterize global changes in the bone marrow niche during parturition.
