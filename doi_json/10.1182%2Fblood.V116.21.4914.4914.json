    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4914 Background. We and others have previously demonstrated that microRNA-155 (miR-155) is overexpressed in patients with Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM) and Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) compared to healthy subjects; indicating that miR-155 may play a crucial role in regulating the pathogenesis of these diseases. We therefore evaluated the role of the novel locked nucleic acid (LNA) antimiR against miR-155 in WM and CLL-derived cell lines. Methods. WM and CLL-derived cell lines (BCWM.1, MEC1) have been treated with 20\u03bcM antisense LNA antimiR-155 or scramble probe (Santaris Pharma, H\u00f8rsholm, Denmark). Efficiency of delivered LNA oligos into cells was determined by using FAM-labeled LNA, followed by Flow cytometry (FACS). Survival and cell proliferation were assessed by MTT assay and thymidine uptake, respectively. Serum levels of miR-155 from peripheral blood of WM patients or healthy subjects and the level of miR-155-targeted genes were detected by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). Results. Efficiency of delivered LNA oligos into both WM and CLL-derived cell lines was higher than 90%. LNA antimiR-155 reduced proliferation of WM and CLL-derived cell lines, as compared to LNA scramble probe used as a control. In contrast, LNA antimiR-155 did not exert any effect on survival of them. We demonstrated increased expression of miR-155-targeted genes, such as CEBP\u03b2, SOCS1, and TP53DINP1 in WM cells upon LNA antimiR-155 treatment. Moreover, we found miR-155 could be detected in peripheral blood serum of WM patients, but not the serum of healthy subjects. Summary. These data provide preclinical evidence for using the novel antisense LNA antimiR-155 in WM and CLL. Moreover, serum levels of miR-155 could potentially be used as a biomarker in patients with WM.
