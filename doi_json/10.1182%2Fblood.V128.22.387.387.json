    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) remains a major source of morbidity and mortality following allogeneic transplantation. While corticosteroids remain first line therapy for cGVHD, they are associated with significant toxicity, and a substantial proportion of patients fail to completely respond. Treatments for steroid-refractory cGVHD are limited. While the pathophysiology of chronic GVHD is complex, activated T cells play a critical role, driven by allo-antigen stimulation. As such, inhibition of T cell activation via blockade of co-stimulation has potential as a therapeutic target in cGVHD. Abatacept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human CTLA-4 and a fragment of the Fc domain of human IgG1 that has been modified to prevent complement fixation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Abatacept is the first drug in a class of agents termed \"selective co-stimulation modulators.\" The CTLA-4 moiety of Abatacept binds specifically to CD80 and CD86 and down-modulates the CD28-mediated co-stimulation of T cells. We conducted a phase I clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the safety, clinical and immune effects of Abatacept in patients with steroid-refractory cGVHD. Methods: The study followed a 3+3 design with two escalating doses of Abatacept to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD): 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were defined as Grade 3 or 4 toxicities judged to be probably or definitely related to Abatacept. Infection was not considered a DLT. Abatacept was administered for a total of 6 doses. Doses 1-3 were administered at two-week intervals. One month following Dose 3, Abatacept was given at four-week intervals for three doses (Doses 4-6). Inclusion criteria included recipients of allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation with myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning , with cGVHD defined by NIH consensus criteria. Patients must have had treatment with \u2265 0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone for at least 4 weeks. Patients with active malignant disease relapse or other active malignancy and patients with uncontrolled infection were excluded. Peripheral blood was drawn prior to each dose of Abatacept and following completion of therapy to assess the effect of treatment on circulating T cells. PD-1 expression on circulating T cells, and T cell expression of interferon gamma versus IL-10 was assessed by multichannel FACS analysis. Results: 17 subjects were treated. Three patients were treated at a dose of 3 mg/kg without DLT. Three evaluable patients completed treatment on cohort 2, at a dose of 10mg/kg without DLT. A forth participant withdrew consent following one dose of treatment and therefore is not evaluable. Ten patients were treated on an expansion cohort at a dose of 10mg/kg. We observed one grade 4 pulmonary infection, and three grade 3 pulmonary infections which resolved. Other Abatacept related adverse events included grade 2 gastritis (n=1), grade 2 pain (n=1), and grade 1 diarrhea (n=2), fatigue (n=2), rash (n=1), and skin pain (n=1). Of the 16 evaluable patients, 7 (44%) achieved a clinical partial response as defined by improvement of two disease systems based on the 2011 NIH consensus criteria. Abatacept resulted in a 51.3% reduction in prednisone usage in clinical responders with a mean baseline dose of 27mg compared to a mean dose of 14mg 1 month following the 6 th dose of Abatacept (p = 0.01). PD-1 expression on circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells increased from a mean of 3.4% and 2.7% respectively at baseline to a mean of 8.9% and 7.6% respectively at one month following the 6 th dose of Abatacept in clinical responders (n=3; p<0.05). In contrast, no change in T cell expression of PD-1 was observed in non-responders. A shift from Th1 to Th2 cytokine secretion was observed in clinical responders, with a mean 2.8 fold decrease in interferon gamma and a mean 2.5 fold increase in IL-10 secretion by circulating T cell populations (n=4). Conclusion : Abatacept is well-tolerated in the treatment of steroid-refractory cGVHD. Abatacept resulted in the improvement in NIH cGVHD scores in 44% of patients with steroid-refractory GVHD with a significant decrease in prednisone dose. An increase in PD-1 expression and a skewing toward Th2 cytokines was observed in clinical responders. Based on this promising data, a phase II trial is being initiated.
