    "abstract_text": "Dasatinib (SPRYCEL\u00ae, formerly BMS-354825) is a novel, oral, multi-targeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC. Relapsing pts with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+) ALL) who have been previously treated with chemotherapy including im have a very poor prognosis. START-L is an open label, multi-center, global phase-II study, which treated 46 im-r or im-i pts with Ph(+) ALL from January through June 2005. Dasatinib was given orally, 70 mg twice daily (BID) with escalation to 100 mg BID for poor response or reductions to 50 mg and 40 mg BID for toxicity. Response was assessed on weekly blood counts and monthly bone marrow exams, including cytogenetics. Mutation analysis was conducted at baseline and at end of study. Quantitative PCR was carried out pretreatment and at the time of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR). At the time of this update, all 46 pts had a minimum of 9 months (mo) of follow-up. Of these, 44 (96%) were im-r; due to the small number of im-i pts, data for all pts are presented. 59% of patients were male and median age was 48 years. The median time from initial Ph(+) ALL diagnosis to first dose was 18 mo. All patients had been pretreated with im including 46% with 600 mg per day or more, and 52% whose duration of im treatment was more than 12 mo. 37% of the pts had received a stem cell transplant. At baseline, 67% of pts had WBC <2000/mm 3 , 74% had platelets <100 \u00d7 10 3 /mm 3 , and 24% had extramedullary disease outside of the spleen. In the 40 pts with baseline mutation data, im-resistant BCR-ABL mutations were observed in 78%, one with T315I. The median duration of therapy was 3.0 mo (range 0.03\u201316.5) for all pts and was 13.0 mo (9.2\u201316.5) for pts still on study. The overall complete hematologic response rate was 35%. The major cytogenetic response was 57%, including 54% CCyR. The major hematologic response (MHR) in the 31 pts with baseline mutations was 45%. The median duration of MHR was 11 mo and the median progression-free survival was 3.7 mo (95% CI 1.6\u20136.1). Grades 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 13% and 67%, respectively and grades 3 and 4 neutropenia occurred in 27% and 52% of pts, respectively. Most frequent non-hematologic toxicities included diarrhea in 30% (grade 3\u20134, 7%), nausea in 22% (no grade 3\u20134), pyrexia in 22% (grade 3\u20134, 2%), and pleural effusion in 22% (grade 3\u20134, 7%) of pts. Dose was reduced in 30% and interrupted in 43% of pts, primarily due to non-hematologic toxicities. Dasatinib has important efficacy in this Ph(+) ALL pt population. Updated efficacy (including molecular response), safety, and mutational analysis data will be presented at the meeting."
