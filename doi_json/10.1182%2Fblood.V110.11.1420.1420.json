    "abstract_text": "Background: Due to lacking of appropriate culture systems, it has been difficult to analyze mechanisms of human B lymphocytes. However, we recently found that human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have high ability to support human B lymphopoiesis. Although many investigators have believed that stromal layers are essential for supporting the differentiation of human B lymphocyte progenitors, this hypothesis is not a case. By manipulating our co-culture system, we have successfully established stroma-free suspension cultures, which produce CD10 + B cells from human umbilical cord blood (CB) CD34 + cells. Methods: Our stroma-free culture of CB CD34 + cells was performed in QBSF\u00ae medium with 10% FCS in the presence of 10 ng/ml stem cell factor (SCF) and 5 ng/ml Flt3-ligand (FL) with or without 5 ng/ml IL-7. Results: Even when co-cultures were separated from MSC with membrane filters, they could produce CD10 + cells. Moreover, addition of MSC supernatant to the cultures permitted CD34 + cells to emerge CD10 + cells in the absence of MSC. Therefore, the cell-cell contact between MSC and B lymphocyte progenitors was not essential. For stroma-free human B cell cultures with MSC supernatant, QBSF\u00ae was the most suitable and serum components were essential while depending on their lot. Although addition of thymic stromal lymphopoietin or IL-7 increased the production of CD10 + cells, neutralizing antibodies for them showed no effect. Addition of Hemokinin-1 antagonist diminished, albeit to a limited degree, the production of CD10 + cells. Addition of neutralizing antibody for CXCR4 had no effect. Therefore, MSC supernatant contains some supportive factors except for them. When cultures without MSC or their supernatant stared at 1x10 4 cells/ml, they could successfully produce CD10 + cells. The density of the cultured cells was critical. The production of CD10 + cells was not detected when CD34 + cells were seeded at low density (1x10 3 /ml). Moreover, when the cultured cells were diluted and adjusted at 1x10 4 /ml weekly, the emergence of CD10 + cells was not observed while the production of CD33 + myeloid cells was enhanced. Therefore, surrounding hematopoietic cells seemed to be required to support human B lymphopoiesis. Our suspension cultures of 1x10 4 CD34 + cells in the presence of SCF, FL, and IL-7 without any stromal materials generated approximately 0.5\u20131x10 6 CD10 + cells at 4 week. CD33 + cells were first expanded within 2 weeks, and then CD10 + cells appeared. When the cultured cells were transplanted into NOD/SCID/\u03b3 c null mice, they reconstituted both myeloid and B lymphoid lineages. Therefore, some cultured cells maintain stem cell character. Conclusions: We have established stroma-free suspension cultures, which effectively produce CD10 + B cells from CB CD34 + cells. High cell density condition can in part substitute for stromal layers in supporting human B lymphopoiesis although the addition of MSC supernatant enhances the production of CD10 + cells. Our suspension culture does not use any stromal cells, which produce many positive or negative regulators for human B lymphopoiesis. This simplicity proposes that this culture system is useful in a variety of fields such as the screening direct effects of drugs influencing on human B lymphocyte development and the evaluation of progenitors in patients with B-cell malignancies as well as the cloning of human B lymphocyte-supportive molecules.",
