    "abstract_text": "Endothelial outgrowth cells (EOC) can be generated from mononuclear blood cells. Based on proliferative and functional characteristics, EOC were claimed to derive from an immature endothelial progenitor cell or angioblast. Several investigators have claimed that these cells constitute a subpopulation of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells(HSC). However, the EOC-precursor is not well defined and its nature remains elusive. Methods and results: Umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells were sorted into a small (< 1 %) CD34 + CD45 \u2212 non-hematopoietic cell fraction (purity > 99.5%) and CD34 + CD45 + HSC (purity > 99.2 %) (n=5). The cell fractions were cultured separately in EBM2/EGM2 medium (Cambrex, Verviers, Belgium) onto gelatine coated 24 wells. EOC were exclusively derived from the CD34+CD45\u2212 cell fraction and not from the CD45+ HSC. We further analysed the CD34+CD45\u2212 cell fraction for expression of endothelial progenitor genes. Analysis showed the presence of VEGFR2, VE-Cadherine and CD146 on the CD34+CD45\u2212 precursor population whereas CD45+ HSC were consistantly negative for these markers. CD133, which was claimed to be a marker for endothelial progenitors was negative on the CD34+CD45\u2212 cells. No VEGFR2+ CD133+ cells could be detected either by flowcytometry or at the mRNA level. In adult bone marrow, EOC only derived from CD45 \u2212 CD31 + cells, and not from the CD45+ HSC or CD45 \u2212 CD31 \u2212 mesenchymal cells. CD34 + CD45 + HSC or CD14+ CD45+ monocytes generated under the same conditions large flat adherent cells positive for CD31, LDL uptake and the lectin UEA-1. On RT-PCR and real time RT-PCR analysis, cells were positive for VEGFRII, CD146 and VE cadherin. However, membrane staining was consistently negative for VE-cadherin on flowcytometric analysis and positive for monocytic markers such as CD14 and CD45. In functional assays, the majority of the cells were shown to be phagocytic and were unable to form vascular tubes in the matrigel angiogenesis assay. These data demonstrate that monocytes may acquire a phenotype in vitro which is difficult to discriminate from endothelial cells. Conclusion : Endothelial cell generated in vitro from cord blood or bone marrow derive from a CD45\u2212 nonhematopoietic precursor.",
