    "abstract_text": "Background VOD/SOS is an unpredictable, potentially life-threatening complication of conditioning regimens for HSCT or post-chemotherapy without HSCT. VOD/SOS with multi-organ dysfunction (MOD) may be associated with >80% mortality. For pediatric and adult patients, defibrotide is approved to treat hepatic VOD/SOS with renal or pulmonary dysfunction post-HSCT in the United States and to treat severe hepatic VOD/SOS post-HSCT in the European Union. The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation notes that clinical presentation, incidence, and survival rates of VOD/SOS may differ between pediatric and adult patients. Kaplan-Meier Day +100 estimated survival results specific to pediatric patients receiving defibrotide 25 mg/kg/day include those of pediatric patients with and without MOD in a compassionate-use study (CUP; 70.2%, n=131). Here, we report outcomes from the largest pediatric cohort of VOD/SOS patients treated with defibrotide. Methods The original T-IND protocol required VOD/SOS diagnosis by Baltimore criteria or biopsy post-HSCT, with MOD (renal or pulmonary). The study was amended to include patients without MOD (off-label), with VOD/SOS per modified Seattle criteria, or VOD/SOS post-chemotherapy without HSCT (off-label). Defibrotide (25 mg/kg/d) was recommended \u226521 days. Day +100 survival was analyzed for all pediatric patients, subgroups with and without MOD, and post hoc with VOD/SOS onset after Day +21 (ie, late-onset). A post hoc exploratory analysis examined the relationship between Day +100 survival and time from VOD/SOS diagnosis to start of defibrotide, using cutoffs before and after particular days (Fisher's exact test for each cutoff day) as well as for treatment initiated on particular days post-diagnosis (Cochran-Armitage trend test). Results Of 1000 patients with VOD/SOS post-HSCT enrolled in the T-IND and receiving \u22651 dose of defibrotide, 570 were aged \u226416 years: 281 (49.3%) had MOD and 289 (50.7%) did not ( Table 1 ). Median age at HSCT was 4 years, with 52.5% aged 2 to 11 years. The most common primary diseases were acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; 19.6%), neuroblastoma (18.2%), and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL; 18.1%). Characteristics were similar in the 95-patient late-onset subgroup (MOD, n=51; no MOD, n=44); the median age was slightly higher (5 years), and neuroblastoma was the most common primary disease (n=24, 25.5%), followed by ALL (n=21, 22.3%), and AML (n=18, 19.1%). Kaplan-Meier estimated survival rate at Day +100 for the entire post-HSCT pediatric population was 67.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 63.8%-71.6%): MOD patients, 58.1% (95% CI, 52.0%-63.7%); no MOD patients, 77.6% (95% CI, 72.2%-82.1%). In the late-onset group, Kaplan-Meier estimated Day +100 survival was: 60.4% (95% CI, 49.5%-69.7%) for the total group; with MOD, 45.4% (95% CI, 31.0%-58.6%); no MOD, 78.4% (95% CI, 62.5%-88.1%). In the timing of initiation analysis for the overall population, Day +100 survival was significantly higher with earlier treatment after diagnosis at most cutoff days ( Figure 1A ). The trend test was statistically significant over time for higher Day +100 survival with earlier initiation ( P <.001; Figure 1B ). Reasons for treatment delay were not assessed. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 374/570 (65.6%) patients, with treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) in 122 (21.4%; Table 2 ). TRAEs in >1% of patients were pulmonary hemorrhage (n=36, 6.3%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (n=15, 2.6%), hypotension (n=11, 1.9%), epistaxis (n=8, 1.4%), and lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage (n=6, 1.1%). TRAEs leading to discontinuation in >1% of patients were pulmonary hemorrhage (n=33, 5.8%) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (n=8, 1.4%). The only TRAE leading to death in >1% of patients was pulmonary hemorrhage (n=10, 1.8%). The safety profile was similar for the subgroup with late-onset VOD/SOS. Conclusions Final analyses of the pediatric population in the T-IND study demonstrated Kaplan-Meier estimated Day +100 survival (67.9%). No new safety signals were observed. Post hoc analyses provided supportive evidence for the clinical utility of defibrotide in patients with VOD/SOS onset after Day +21. This post-hoc analysis showed that prompt treatment with defibrotide improved survival outcome for VOD/SOS in pediatric patients with and without MOD. Support: Jazz Pharmaceuticals.
