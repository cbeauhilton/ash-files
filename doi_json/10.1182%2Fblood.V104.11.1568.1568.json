    "abstract_text": "The \u03b1 2A -adrenergic receptor mediates important physiologic responses, such as regulation of blood pressure, control of sympathetic autonomic responses, as well as the platelet response to epinephrine. The gene encoding the \u03b1 2A -adrenergic receptor is polymorphic. One of the polymorphisms, known as the Dra I polymorphism, is located in the 3\u2032 untranslated region of this gene. The Dra I polymorphism of the \u03b1 2A -adrenergic receptor is associated with a higher incidence of systemic arterial hypertension among African-Americans. Although the presence of this polymorphism was known by Southern-blot analysis of the human genomic DNA for more than a decade, the exact location and nature of this polymorphism was unknown. We have located the Dra I polymorphism in the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the \u03b1 2A -adrenergic receptor gene (G 1838 A) and developed a PCR-based detection method. The allele and haplotype frequencies for polymorphisms of the \u03b1 2A -adrenergic receptor gene in different ethnic groups were identified. After studying the correlation between epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation and the genotypes for the G 1838 A polymorphism among 235 human subjects, it was found that the 1838G allele is associated with an increase in the level of platelet aggregation in response to epinephrine among African-Americans, but not among Caucasians or Hispanics. This polymorphism may be responsible for the variability in the epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation among individuals and acts as a risk factor for thrombotic vascular event.",
