    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2524 WT1 monitoring is an almost universal target to follow de novo AML. Its exppression in myeloid malignancies is upregulated in parallel to the blast percentage. Recently, WT1 determination has been standardized as result of an European Leukemia Net initiative. Early reports have demonstrated that the best results are obtained when peripheral blood is used to establish clinical predictions. Pediatric studies in AML have shown that raised WT1 levels after induction associate with unfavourable outcome. Despite all the mentioned, WT1 quantitation has not yet gained widespread use, in part because some AML show normal WT1 levels at diagnosis. To investigate the prognostic impact of the normalized bone marrow WT1 levels at diagnosis and post-induction in a consecutive series of de novo AML patients enrolled in the CETLAM group trials. Available bone marrow samples at diagnosis (586 cases) and post induction (367 cases) were obtained in each participating center and sent to the CETLAM repository center at the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau for complete immunophenotype and molecular analyses. One \u03bcg of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA in a total reaction volume of 20\u03bcl containing Cl 2 Mg 5mM, 10\u00d7 Buffer, DTT 10mM, dNTP's 10mM each, random hexamers 15\u03bcM, RNAsin 20 units (Promega) and 200 units of MMLV enzyme. WT1 expression levels were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) in an ABI PRISM 7700\u00ae Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the primers and conditions described by the ELN group (Cilloni et al J. Clin. Oncol 2009;27:5195-201). For WT1 copy number titration, the IPSOGEN\u00ae (Marseille, France) plasmid was employed. Results were expressed as copies and four normal bone marrow samples were used as test controls. Patients were treated between 2004 and 2011 according to the CETLAM03 protocol. Adults up to 70 years of age received induction chemotherapy with idarubicin, intermediate-dose cytarabine and etoposide, followed by consolidation with mitoxantrone and intermediate-dose ara-C. Subsequently, patients with favourable cytogenetics at diagnosis received one cycle of high-dose cytarabine.G-CSF priming during induction and consolidation was used. Patients with favorable cytogenetics and high leukocyte counts at diagnosis were treated with autologous transplantation instead of high-dose cytarabine. Furthermore, patients with a normal karyotype but an adverse molecular profile (FLT3 mutations or MLL rearrangements) were allocated to the treatment for unfavorable cases; this included allogeneic transplantation from an HLA-identical donor. Overall survival (OS) was measured from the date of enrolment until the date of death. Leukemia-free survival (LFS) for patients who achieved a CR was calculated from the date of CR to relapse or death. OS and LFS were plotted by the Kaplan-Meier method; differences between curves were analyzed by the log-rank test. The probability of relapse was calculated using cumulative incidence estimates and taking into account the competing risk of death in remission. A WT1 cut-off value of 5065.2 copies at diagnosis was obtained. Two hundred and four samples had WT1 levels greater than this value, whereas 382 samples showed levels below this cut-off. These groups had statistically different OS 55\u00b13 vs 33\u00b15 p<0.001, LFS 52\u00b13 vs 30\u00b16 p:0.004 and CIR 34\u00b13 vs 56\u00b16 p<0.001. As regards the post-induction results, four groups were established: Group 0 (135 patients) with WT1 levels between 0 and 17.5 copies, Group 1 (107 patients) with WT1 values ranging from 17.6 to 76 copies, Group 2 (54 patients) with WT1 between 76.1 and 170.5 copies and Group 3 (71 patients) with WT1 levels after induction greater than>170.6 copies. These groups showed statistically significant differences(p<0.001) in terms of OS: Group 0 59\u00b14 months, Group 1 50\u00b15 months, Group 2 45\u00b17 months and Group 3 23\u00b16 months. LFS was also statiscally different: Group 0: 58\u00b14, Group 1: 46\u00b15, Group 2: 39\u00b18 and Group 3:19\u00b18 (all p<0.001). Lastlly, CIR was markedly different between the four groups: Group 0:25\u00b14, Group 1: 44\u00b15, Group 2: 46\u00b18 and Group 3: 68\u00b18(p<0.001) . WT1 quantitation at diagnosis and post-induction provide a simple and well standardized measurement of the prognostic risk of adult AML patiens. Larger series need to be analyzed to ascertain whether this determination could be incorporated to initial AML risk stratification. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
