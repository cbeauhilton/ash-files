    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5197 Introduction Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive malignancy that accounts for nearly 40% of all lymphoid tumors. Both miR-155 and miR-146a expression levels are suggested to be regulated by NF-KB expression in DLBCL. In present study, the expression of miR-155 and miR-146a were investigated to evaluate the prognosis in DLBCL patients. Patients and Methods The expression levels of miR-155 and miR-146a in formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded tissue of patients with DLBCL (n=50) have been compared with reactive hyperplasia lymphoid nodes (n=20) by using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Clinical characters of patients such as LDH, \u03b2 2 -MG, International Prognostic Index (IPI), ECOG score and c-myc expression levels have also been investigated. Results 1) The expression levels of miR-155 and miR-146a were significantly higher in DLBCL patients than control ( P <0.001).

(For miR-155 5y-PFS, Hazards ratio 0.260, 95% CI, 0.058\u20130.801; for miR-146a 5y-PFS, Hazards ratio 0.251, 95% CI, 0.068\u20130.922) 8) Compared to CHOP protocol, the higher miR-155 expression level patients who chose R-CHOP protocol for treatment achieved better 3y-PFS and 3y-OS ( P <0.05). Conclusions The expression levels of miR-155 and miR-146a were higher in DLBCL patients. Moreover, high expressions of these two microRNAs were associated with the disease progression. Patients with higher miR-155 expression levels may be benefit from the protocol including Rituximab. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
