    "abstract_text": "Background: Elderly patients with multiple myeloma are a challenging population to treat, and there is a need for effective treatment options. Carfilzomib, a selective proteasome inhibitor, is approved in the United States and other countries for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). A subgroup analysis of interim results from the randomized, phase 3 ENDEAVOR study showed that carfilzomib (56 mg/m 2 ) and dexamethasone (Kd56) resulted in longer median progression-free survival (PFS) and higher overall response rates (ORRs) than bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd) in patients with RRMM, regardless of age (Table; Ludwig et al, Leuk Lymphoma . 2017;58:2501-2504). Mature overall survival (OS) data has recently been reported from ENDEAVOR and demonstrated that Kd56 resulted in statistically and clinically significant improvement in OS compared with Vd in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (median, 47.6 months vs 40.0 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.791; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.648-0.964; 1-sided P =0.0100; Dimopoulos et al, Lancet Oncol . In press). Here, we report a subgroup analysis from ENDEAVOR to evaluate OS and updated safety outcomes by age. Methods: Adults with RRMM who received 1-3 prior regimens were eligible for the ENDEAVOR trial. Patients treated with Kd56 received carfilzomib (30-min intravenous [IV] infusion) on days (D) 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 (20 mg/m 2 on D1, 2 [cycle 1]; 56 mg/m 2 thereafter) and dexamethasone (20 mg) on D1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23 of 28-day cycles. In the Vd arm, patients received bortezomib (1.3 mg/m 2 ; IV or subcutaneously) on D1, 4, 8, and 11 and dexamethasone (20 mg) on D1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of 21-day cycles. Patients were treated until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable toxicity. OS was compared between treatment arms in patients grouped according to age (i.e., <65, 65-74, and \u226575 years of age) using an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model. Results: The ITT population included 929 patients enrolled in the study (<65 years: Kd56, n=223; Vd, n=210; 65-74 years: Kd56, n=164; Vd, n=189; \u226575 years: Kd56, n=77; Vd, n=66). OS was improved with Kd56 vs Vd within each age subgroup (<65 years: median, 47.6 months vs 41.9 months [HR, 0.847; 95% CI, 0.634-1.132]; 65-74 years: median, not estimable vs 37.0 months [HR, 0.706; 95% CI, 0.508-0.981]; \u226575 years: median, 42.4 months vs 25.9 months [HR, 0.841; 95% CI, 0.522-1.355]) (Table). Kaplan-Meier OS curves by age are shown in the Figure. In the safety population (n=919), the median duration of treatment was longer with Kd56 than with Vd within each age subgroup (<65 years: median, 49.0 weeks vs 27.0 weeks; 65-74 years: 49.9 weeks vs 27.6 weeks; \u226575 years: 43.3 weeks vs 20.6 weeks). Rates of any-grade adverse events (AEs) and grade \u22653 AEs of interest are shown in the Table. Grade \u22653 hypertension, dyspnea, cardiac failure, acute renal failure, and cardiac ischemia were generally more common with Kd56 vs Vd within each age subgroup, whereas grade \u22653 peripheral neuropathy occurred more often with Vd vs Kd56 within each subgroup (Table). AEs were not adjusted for exposure. Conclusions: Clinically meaningful improvements in OS were observed with Kd56 compared with Vd across all age groups examined, including patients aged \u226575 years. The safety results were comparable to those reported in the age subgroup analysis of the PFS interim results for ENDEAVOR. Overall, these data support the favorable benefit-risk profile of Kd56 in patients with RRMM, regardless of age.
