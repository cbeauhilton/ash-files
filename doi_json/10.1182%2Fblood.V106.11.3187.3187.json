    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The prevalence of pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is high in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Although most patients have only mild increases in their pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), the presence of PHT is strongly associated with an increased risk of death. While PHT seen in SCD is thought to progress over time, both the rate of development of PHT and the factors that affect disease progression remain unknown. Methods: The 41 subjects in this study were drawn from an original cohort of 60 patients followed in the Sickle Cell Clinic at UNC-Chapel Hill. All patients were previously evaluated for PHT (defined using an age-, sex-, and BMI-adjusted reference range). Of the 60 patients in the original cohort, six are now deceased and 13 others were not available for repeat evaluation. The PASP was determined using Doppler echocardiography and then applying the modified Bernoulli equation (PASP = 4V 2 + right atrial pressure). Individuals were not studied if they: 1) showed clinical evidence of left ventricular failure; 2) had a recent acute illness (e.g., vaso-occlusive crisis); or 3) had experienced an episode of acute chest syndrome within the preceding 4 weeks. Means and standard deviations were calculated for all measures at the time of initial evaluation and at the time of follow-up. Results: Of the 41 subjects in our study, PHT was originally present in 12, while no evidence of PHT was present in 29. Of the 29 subjects who initially had no evidence of PHT, 4 (or 14%) have now developed PHT (mean follow-up period of 3.3 \u00b1 0.4 years). In these 4 subjects, the mean PASP at the time of initial and follow-up evaluations respectively were: 37.0 \u00b1 2.0 mm Hg vs. 55.8 \u00b1 11.0 mm Hg. The patients who developed PHT during the course of the study had lower systolic BP (143 \u00b1 12 mm Hg vs. 128 \u00b1 12 mm Hg), lower fetal hemoglobin levels (6.2 \u00b1 5.7 % vs. 4.2 \u00b1 3.7 %), and higher platelet counts (276 \u00b1 119 X 10 3 /\u03bcL vs. 426 \u00b1 96 X 10 3 /\u03bcL) at the time of their follow-up analyses. By contrast, 3 of the 12 subjects (or 25%) who were thought to have PHT at the time of their original evaluations were found to have normal PASP determinations at the time of their repeat echocardiograms (mean follow-up period of 3.2 \u00b1 0.6 years). In these latter 3 subjects, the mean PASP values at the time of the initial and follow-up evaluations respectively were: 40.0 \u00b1 4.6 mm Hg vs. 33.7 \u00b1 4.7 mm Hg. Conclusion: In this small group of patients with SCD, we found that PHT developed in 14% of subjects who had no evidence of PHT 3 years earlier. Based on this observation, it seems that periodic echocardiograms to screen for the development of PHT would be appropriate. On the other hand, our observation that some patients initially classified as having PHT failed to have elevated PASP measurements at the time of follow-up illustrates the limitation of a single echocardiographic evaluation in establishing this diagnosis. Because of the increase in PASP that occurs during acute vaso-occlusive episodes, and the difficulty usually encountered in distinguishing steady state from crisis, the initial elevation of the PASP in these patients could have resulted from sub-clinical crisis states. For these reasons, a patient found to have an elevated PASP at the time of a screening echocardiogram should have a repeat study, and perhaps a right heart catheterization, before the diagnosis of PHT is firmly established."
