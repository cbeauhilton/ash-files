    "abstract_text": "Abstract 694 Background: Small leucine rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) are a family of glycosylated proteins normally expressed in the extracelluar matrix (ECM) of collagen rich tissues. The biological role of the SLRPs is multifactoral, but mostly these proteins are secreted and bind to membrane receptors or ECM proteins affecting cell proliferation and cell migration. Some SLRPs (eg. Decorin, Lumican) have been reported to be expressed in cancer, but the expression as well as the glycosylation pattern differ. Microarray studies have revealed that the SLRP family member fibromodulin (FMOD) gene is overexpressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We later reported the specific expression of FMOD in CLL and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). FMOD is located on chromosome 1q32 adjacent to two other members of the SLRP family, proline/arginine-rich end leucine-rich repeat protein (PRELP) and opticin (OPTC). Aims: To analyse 1) the expression of PRELP and OPTC in CLL and other hematological malignancies. 2) the glycosylation pattern of PRELP and OPTC, and cellular localization of OPTC in CLL cells. Methods: PRELP: Gene expression was tested by RT-PCR and realtime-PCR. Protein expression was tested by western blot. Chemical deglycosylation was performed to characterize the glycosylation pattern of the PRELP protein. OPTC: Cell fractionation was performed using four different methods. Protein expression (molecular weight and cellular location) was tested by western blot. Chemical deglycosylation was performed to characterize the glycosylation pattern of the OPTC protein. Results: PRELP was expressed at the gene level (RT-PCR) in all CLL patients tested (n=30) and in 3/5 patients with mantle cell lymphoma, but not in normal leukocytes (n=10) or in other hematological malignancies (7 different types, n=35). The PRELP protein was detected in all CLL samples tested but not in leukocytes of healthy donors (western blot). Molecular analysis of the CLL PRELP protein revealed a unique unglycosylated 38 kDa core protein, with an intact signal peptide. This protein was not detected in serum that, in combination with the uncleaved signal peptide, suggests cellular retention. A \u201cnormal\u201d OPTC protein (50 kDa) was detected in cell lysates of both CLL tumor cells (n=30) and normal leukocytes (n=10). However, the CLL cells also expressed a 37 kDa OPTC that was not detected in healthy controls. This 37 kDa OPTC was detected in all CLL samples and molecular analysis revealed a unique unglycosylated core protein that was located in the cell nucleus and endoplasmatic reticulum of the CLL cells. Conclusion: The unique expression of the SLRPs PRELP and OPTC in CLL (in addition to the previously reported FMOD) is unexpected and merits further studies since the specific expression of three closely related SLRP genes may indicate a role in the pathobiology of the disease.
