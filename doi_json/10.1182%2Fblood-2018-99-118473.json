    "abstract_text": "Background: CTCL represents a rare group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas with substantial negative impact on patient (pt) quality of life and mortality in advanced-stage disease. Mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common subtype of CTCL, and the rarer leukemic variant S\u00e9zary syndrome (SS) are distinct subtypes of CTCL. Mogamulizumab is a first-in-class, defucosylated monoclonal antibody directed against C-C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4), which is highly expressed on malignant T-cells in CTCL. Primary results from the MAVORIC study (data cut-off December 2016), a phase 3 trial comparing mogamulizumab to FDA-approved vorinostat in adults with relapsed/refractory MF/SS, showed mogamulizumab significantly prolonged median progression-free survival compared with vorinostat (7.7 vs 3.1 months, P<0.0001), with a confirmed overall global response rate (comprised of all disease compartments) of 28% and an expected and generally manageable safety profile. This follow-up analysis assessed the safety and efficacy of mogamulizumab based on treatment exposure in order to characterize pts with MF/SS who were able to achieve long-term clinical benefit with mogamulizumab. Methods: This was an open-label, randomized, international, phase 3 study (NCT01728805). Pts with MF/SS who were treated with \u22651 prior systemic therapy were randomized 1:1 to receive mogamulizumab (1.0 mg/kg, administered once weekly for the first 28-day cycle, then on Days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles) or oral vorinostat (400 mg daily). In this follow-up analysis (data cut-off September 2017), exposure quartiles were determined, and baseline demographics, confirmed global response rate, and safety were analyzed by exposure group. To detect linear trends across exposure quartiles, frequencies were analyzed using Chi-square test and continuous data were assessed by analysis of variance. Results: A total of 184 pts randomized to mogamulizumab were included in this analysis. Mean time of mogamulizumab exposure was 275 days (d; standard deviation [SD]: 292 d; range: 1-1617). Based on quartile assessment, >351 d was defined as cut-off for long-term exposure. Baseline characteristics across exposure groups are shown in the Table. Significant trends were observed for baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS; P=0.04), disease type (P=0.03), and blood involvement (defined as \u2265B1 per Olsen et al J Clin Oncol 2011; P351 d, 76% had a confirmed global response (ie, either complete or partial response). The percentage of pts reporting a treatment-emergent adverse event (AE) or serious AE did not vary with increasing exposure to mogamulizumab (351 d: 21% and 4%, respectively). The most common treatment-related AEs reported by pts after >351 d of exposure to mogamulizumab were drug eruption (9/45 [20%]), thrombocytopenia (5/45 [11%]), stomatitis (4/45 [9%]), and anemia (4/45 [9%]). Conclusions: This follow-up analysis of the phase 3 MAVORIC study demonstrated mogamulizumab treatment of pts with MF/SS for approximately 1 year was not associated with an increased safety risk. Significant long-term clinical benefit was observed in pts with blood involvement at baseline, regardless of CCR4 expression status. A higher proportion of pts who had long-term (>351 days) exposure attained confirmed global response versus those who had less exposure.
