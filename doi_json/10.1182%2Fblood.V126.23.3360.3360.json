    "abstract_text": "Objective: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is commonly associated with different types of anemia. The diagnosis and treatment of IDA is a medical necessity; being a well-recognized cause of both short and long term morbidity plus being strongly related to poor disease outcome. In the presence of concomitant chronic illness or inflammation, the diagnosis of iron deficiency using the conventional laboratory parameters is a major medical challenge. Therefore, the utility of two recent iron status parameters; hepcidin-25 \"active form of iron metabolism negative regulator\" and reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) \"functional anemia indicator\" was compared to that of two conventional ones; transferrin saturation (TSAT) and red cell distribution width percentages (RDW%) in diagnosing iron deficiency anemia in patients with JIA. Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 43 JIA patients whose ages ranged from 3 to 16 years and 20 age and sex matched healthy children as control group. Three different types of anemia; iron deficiency anemia (IDA), anemia of chronic disease (ACD) and combined anemia (IDA/ACD) were identified within the studied patients using iron profile, ESR and C-reactive protein. Serum hepcidin-25 was assessed by ELISA technique; CHr, TSAT% and RDW% were all estimated using Siemens ADVIA 2120 analyzer in patients and the control group. Results: Anemia was identified in 22 (51.2%) patients. Serum hepcidin-25 and TSAT% were significantly lower in IDA than ACD & IDA/ACD patients (p= 0.032 and p=0.034 for hepcidin and p= 0.004 and p=0.012 for TSAT%). Significantly lower CHr and higher RDW% were found in IDA/ACD compared to ACD patients (p= 0.032 and p< 0.001, respectively). Serum hepcidin \u2264 3.8ng/mL and TSAT% \u2264 5.8% differentiated IDA from both ACD and IDA/ACD with 80 and 100% sensitivity and 88.24% specificity. CHr \u226424.4pg and RDW % > 16.4% showed 80 and 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity; distinguishing IDA/ACD from ACD. Conclusion: Serum hepcidin and CHr were not superior to TSAT% and RDW%; discriminating among different types of anemia in JIA patients. Table 1.
