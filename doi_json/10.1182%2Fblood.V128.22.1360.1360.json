    "abstract_text": "Platelets are produced from mature megakaryocytes (MK) following a profound cellular reorganization. This includes the assembly of microtubules (MT) into a unique submenbranous coiled structure, the marginal band (MB). This process is thought to depend on a specific \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin isotype repertoire. The MK-restricted-\u03b21-tubulin, the predominant isoform of the MB, is already known to be important for platelet biogenesis but the implication of other isotypes is currently unknown. Our goal was to establish the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin repertoire in platelets and during megakaryopoiesis and to evaluate the implication of selected isotypes in platelet formation. To establish an exhaustive list of the tubulin isotypes, we used combination of RT PCR and proteomic analyses to quantify the expression of each isotype in human platelets and in human MK differentiated in culture from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors. Information gained on the hierarchical combination of tubulin isoforms in the course of platelet biogenesis has been extended at the functional level to investigate both their role in marginal band formation and platelet functions \u03b26-, \u03b25- and \u03b11c-tubulin transcripts were already present in CD34+ cells and decreased during the final stages of megakaryopoiesis. On the other hand, \u03b21-, \u03b14A- and \u03b18-tubulin transcripts were only observed later during MK differentiation and in platelets. Quantitative LC-SRM mass spectrometry confirmed the predominant expression of \u03b21 and \u03b14A-isotypes in platelets. A functional role of the newly identified \u03b14a-tubulin was supported by the thrombocytopenia and enlarged platelets with a decreased number of MT coils (1-3) comprising less-acetylated tubulin in mice carrying a point mutation in tuba4a . Additionally, a tendency to increased responses to several agonists was observed in these platelets. This study reveals new information on the evolution of the tubulin isotype repertoire in platelet formation pointing to a role of less-widely expressed \u03b1-isotypes.
