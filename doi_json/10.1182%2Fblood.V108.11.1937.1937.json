    "abstract_text": "Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by the infiltration of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) by leukemic cells presenting a block of differentiation at the stage of promyelocytes. At the cytogenetic level, APL is associated with the t(15;17) which causes the fusion of two genes: Retinoic Receptor \u03b1 (RAR\u03b1) and Promyelocytic Leukemia (PML), on chromosomes 17 and 15, respectively. C/EBP\u03b1 is a leucine zipper transcription factor essential to normal granulopoiesis. Mutations in C/EBP\u03b1 gene are detected in 6\u201310% of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cases and C/EBP\u03b1 activity is down-regulated by AML1-ETO fusion protein associated with FAB M2 subtype. We decided to test whether PML-RAR\u03b1 interferes with C/EBP\u03b1 function, thus contributing to the blockage of differentiation characteristic of APL. We generated mutant mice expressing PML-RAR\u03b1 and haploinsufficient for C/EBP\u03b1 (PR C/EBP\u03b1 +/\u2212 ) by crossing hCG PML-RAR\u03b1 transgenic mice (PR TM) and C/EBP\u03b1 +/\u2212 . Leukemia was not detected in WT (n=415) and C/EBP\u03b1 +/\u2212 (n=47) mice after 800 days of follow up. In contrast, 8.2% PR TM (19/233) and 14.9% (13/87) PR C/EBP\u03b1 +/\u2212 mice developed a form of leukemia that closely resembled human APL and identical to that developed by PR TM. The leukemia-free survival was significantly shorter in PR C/EBP\u03b1 +/\u2212 compared to PR TM (644.3 days; 95% Confidence Interval, 95%C.I.: 586.4 \u2013 702.2 vs 718.4 days; 95%C.I.: 689.3 \u2013 747.5, P =0.02). Both groups presented a long latency for the development of the disease with a mean age (95%C.I.) at diagnosis of 399.9 days (184\u2013673) and 495.8 days (215\u2013757) in PR and PR C/EBP\u03b1 +/\u2212 , respectively. PR and PR C/EBP\u03b1 +/\u2212 leukemic mice presented similar WBC counts (107.1 \u00b1 82.65x10 3 vs 63.55 \u00b1 57.82x10 3 cells/ml, P =0.26), hemoglobin concentrations (10.87 \u00b1 3.69 vs 9.92 \u00b1 2.39 g/dl, P =0.57) and platelet counts (283.8 \u00b1 188.7x10 3 vs 177.8 \u00b1 149.5x10 3 platelets/ml, P =0.24). In both groups, the leukemic cells resembled promyelocytes, and expressed the phenotype CD11b + Gr1 + CD34 \u00b1 c-Kit + , which represented 46.65 \u00b1 26.89%; 32.72 \u00b1 15.16% and 1.91 \u00b1 1.42% of the spleen cells from PR; PR C/EBP\u03b1 +/\u2212 and WT, respectively. In order to isolate PML-RAR\u03b1 leukemic cells and their normal counterparts to gene expression assessment, BM samples from WT mice (pooled from 2 mice), non leukemic PR C/EBP\u03b1 +/\u2212 mice (pooled from 2 mice), and spleen cells from WT and leukemic PR C/EBP\u03b1 +/\u2212 mice were first submitted to red cells lyses, stained with previously conjugated antibodies. Cells expressing CD16/32, CD11b, c-kit and CD34, but neither CD3 nor CD45/B220 were isolated. These cells presented medium to large size with a granular cytoplasm. C/EBP\u03b1 and PML-RAR\u03b1 expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR in the sorted cells. Compared to WT cells, promyelocytes from leukemic and non leukemic PR C/EBP\u03b1 +/\u2212 mice expressed significantly less C/EBP\u03b1, with the lowest levels detected in leukemic samples. As expected, PML-RAR\u03b1 was not detected in WT samples. Comparison between cells suspensions containing similar numbers of promyelocytes revealed that PML-RAR\u03b1 expression was higher in leukemic compared to non leukemic PR C/EBP\u03b1 +/\u2212 mice. In conclusion, our data strongly suggest that PML-RAR\u03b1 fusion protein acts as a dominant negative product on C/EBP\u03b1 gene expression in a specific subset of early myeloid cells and contribute to the pathogenesis of APL.",
