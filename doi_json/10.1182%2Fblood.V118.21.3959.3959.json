    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3959 Introduction: Interleukin (IL)-6 serves as a growth factor for B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma (MM), and Castleman's disease (CD). Siltuximab (CNTO 328) is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the biological activity of human IL-6. We have previously reported interim safety and efficacy of siltuximab, which is highly notable in CD (van Rhee et al, Blood 2008;112:1008; Kurzrock et al, Blood 2008;112:1009). We now report the long-term safety of siltuximab in the 29 patients who were treated for more than 1 yr. Methods: An open-label, dose-finding, phase 1 trial of siltuximab in patients with B-cell NHL, MM, or CD was conducted. Five dose-escalation cohorts with increasing total dose exposure [3 mg/kg q 2 weeks (n=6), 6 mg/kg q 2 weeks (n=7), 12 mg/kg q 3 weeks (n=10), 6 mg/kg q 1 week (n=6), 12 mg/kg q 2 weeks (n=6)] were studied initially. Two additional cohorts were subsequently added: 12 mg/kg q 3 weeks as a 1-hour infusion (n=12) and a CD extension cohort with exploratory biomarkers (9 mg/kg q 3 weeks, n=12; 12 mg/kg q 3 weeks, n=8). Between Jun 2005 and Sep 2009, 67 patients (37 CD, 13 MM, 17 NHL) with median age 54 (range 18\u201382) yrs were enrolled. Results: Twenty-nine patients (24 CD, 3 MM, 2 NHL) were treated for at least 1 yr, including 19 and 15 patients treated for >2 and >3 yrs, respectively, with maximum duration of therapy up to 5 yrs. The grade \u22653 AEs most commonly reported between yrs 1 and 2 (irrespective of attribution to siltuximab) were infections (n=7, 24%), including device-related infection and bacteraemia (n=1), staph bacteraemia (n=1), wound abscess and pneumonia (n=1), limb and vulval abscesses (n=1), rectal abscess (n=1), bronchitis (n=1), and herpes zoster (n=1). Other common grade \u22653 AEs were blood and lymphatic system disorders (14%, most were neutropenia [10%]), and gastrointestinal disorders (10%, most were nausea [7%]). Incidence of AEs in these system-organ classes did not increase with longer duration of treatment. AEs of all grades reported in >10% of patients between yrs 1 and 2 were: nausea (31%); diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection (each 28%); leukopenia, hepatic function abnormal, hypertriglyceridemia (each 21%); anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, sinusitis, hypercholesterolemia (each 14%). However, the majority of these AEs were low grade and tended to decrease with time. SAEs did not increase over time (n=5 between yrs 1\u20132, n=2 between yrs 2\u20133, n=4 at >3 yrs), and no specific SAE was reported in more than 1 patient. No patient discontinued therapy due to an AE during the long-term follow-up period, and there were no treatment-related deaths. Although some patients experienced clinically significant laboratory-related AEs, the laboratory results showed that mean levels of creatinine and triglycerides remained stable over time. In the 15 patients treated for \u22653 yrs, the following laboratory parameters showed modest trends of increase in mean value at 36 mos: hemoglobin increased to 13.9 g/dL from 12.4 g/dL at baseline, cholesterol increased to 201.07 mg/dL from 160.73 mg/dL at baseline, and bilirubin increased to 0.76 mg/dL from 0.49 mg/dL at baseline. On the other hand, at 36 mos in these 15 patients, the mean neutrophil count decreased to 3.70 x10 3 /\u03bcL from 6.65 x10 3 /\u03bcL at baseline, and the mean platelet count decreased to 216.0 x10 3 /\u03bcL from 381.8 x10 3 /\u03bcL at baseline. No severe infusion-related reactions were reported. At the time of database lock, 20 patients (1 MM, 19 CD) were still receiving study treatment. All 24 CD patients treated for \u22651 yr had sustained clinical responses, and half (n=12) also had an objective radiologic response, including 1 CR and 11 PR based on central radiology review. Ten of the 12 responders were treated with the highest dose of siltuximab (12 mg/kg), including 1 patient who responded after switching to 12 mg/kg. In addition, 3 unconfirmed PR were seen in the CD patients. Five patients with MM or NHL treated for \u22651 yr also had clinical benefit, including 2 CR and 1 prolonged SD in 3 MM patients and durable PR (>4 mos) in 2 NHL patients. Conclusion: Siltuximab appears to have a favorable safety profile suitable for chronic dosing and shows clinical activity as a single agent, especially in treating Castleman's disease. Phase 2 and 3 studies are ongoing to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of siltuximab in patients with multicentric Castleman's disease and in combination with other agents in patients with multiple myeloma.
