    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells utilize several mechanisms of survival, some propagating proliferation and preventing apoptosis through intrinsic cell cycle signals, and others suppressing anti-tumor immune responses. Patients often present with a predominant population of regulatory T-cells (Tregs), and general features of T-cell exhaustion. Given the unique phenotype of CLL cells and the observed T-cell abnormalities we hypothesized that these cells function as regulatory B-cells (Bregs). Bregs, mostly explored in the autoimmune disease setting, produce interleukin-10 (IL10), which mediates attenuation of effector T-cell responses and enhances regulatory activity. These features have also been suggested to be responsible for weakening of anti-tumor immune responses. Breg activation requires stimulation of various combinations of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the B-cell receptor (BCR) and CD40. Our previous studies have demonstrated that TLR9-stimulated CLL cells \"acquire\" Breg markers as well as PD1 and PDL1, which, while not being classic Breg discriminators, are established players in immune modulation. Moreover, such stimulation resulted in inhibition of proliferation of autologous T-cells. The current study aimed to further explore the regulatory characteristics of CLL cells focusing on additional suppressive mechanisms that may have a role in CLL immune evasion, particularly, the PD1/PDL1 axis. Methods: B-cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of untreated CLL patients (Rai stages 0-IV). These B-CLL cells were stimulated with TLR-9 agonist (ODN) or CD40 ligand (CD40L) followed by their co-culture with isolated autologous CD4+ T cells. The regulatory features of B-CLL cells were studied by testing their effect on T cells. Their proliferation was evaluated using the CFSE method following stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and IL2; induction of Tregs (CD4 + CD25 high Foxp3 + population) was assessed by FACS analysis. The involvement of the PD1/PDL1 axis was examined by incubating B-cells with antiPD1 neutralizing antibodies prior to co-culture. Cell contact dependence was evaluated by plating B-cells in hanging cell culture inserts denying B and T cell contact while allowing flow of small soluble molecules. Results: CLL cells stimulated with ODN or CD40L, induced a significant increase in Tregs: 1.35\u00b10.1-fold (p=0.03, N=12) for ODN and 1.7\u00b10.2-fold (p=0.008, N=14) for CD40L, occurring in 68% and 80% of patients, respectively, while co-culture with unstimulated B-CLL cells did not result in the expansion of the Treg population. Treg induction was observed only under contact conditions (N=5), suggesting that this regulatory function requires cell-to-cell contact and cannot be carried out solely by secreted factors like IL10. Neutralization of PD1 on CLL B-cells affects both Treg induction and T-cell proliferation. Following CD40L stimulation, a 1.3-fold reduction in Treg percentage was observed when PD1 signaling was blunted (N=10). In contrast, PD1 blockage of ODN-stimulated CLL cells did not reduce Treg induction; however, it did adversely affect inhibition of T-cell proliferation (10%-decrease in inhibited T-cells; N=6). Conclusions: CLL cells \"acquire\" a Breg phenotype and function, inhibiting T-cell proliferation and inducing Tregs. These properties, while working together to promote immune regulation and cancer evasion, are elicited by different ligands in the cell environment and are likely to be mediated via separate pathways. The involvement of B-cell-associated PD1 in the induction of Tregs and inhibition of T-cell proliferation suggests a biologic role of PD1 signaling in CLL cells, strengthening the Breg phenotype. The current study has shown that CLL cells recruit several mechanisms operating cooperatively to support immune modulation and promote their survival.
