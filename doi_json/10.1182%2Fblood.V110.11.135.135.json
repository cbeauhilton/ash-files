    "abstract_text": "Integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 activation is critical for platelet physiology and is controlled by agonists- induced signal transduction through kinases and phosphatases. Compared to kinases, a role of phosphatases in platelet integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 signaling and activation is less understood. We have previously demonstrated that the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) associates constitutively with the integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 and regulates myosin light chain phosphorylation. Platelets express three isoforms of PP1c namely PP1c\u03b1, PP1c\u03b2/\u03b4 and PP1c\u03b31, however their role in platelet physiology is unclear. In this study, we explored a role for the PP1c\u03b3 in integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 activation using the PP1c\u03b3 null mice that lacks both PP1c\u03b31 and PP1c\u03b32 splice variants. Deletion of PP1c\u03b3 did not alter the expression of PP1c\u03b1 and PP1c\u03b2/\u03b4 in platelets. Compared to the wild type mice, PP1c\u03b3 null mice had significantly (P=0.03) more platelets but not other blood cells and increased megakaryocytes in an in vitro bone marrow culture system, suggesting that PP1c\u03b3 may regulate platelet production. Compared to the wild type platelets, PP1c\u03b3 null platelets exhibited a \u223c50% decreased activation (P=0.007) of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 in response to low doses of thrombin as measured by the binding of soluble Alexa-flour 488-conjugated fibrinogen or Jon/A, an antibody to high affinity integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 . Consistent with this observation, PP1c\u03b3 null platelets showed decreased aggregation in response to thrombin or protease activated receptor activating peptide. Soluble fibrinogen binding and aggregation to ADP, collagen and cross linked collagen -related peptide was not different between the PP1c\u03b3 null and wild type platelets. Surface expression of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 was comparable in the PP1c\u03b3 null platelets indicating that the decreased activation of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 in PP1c\u03b3 platelets was not due to decreased integrin expression. These studies suggest that PP1c\u03b3 is required for thrombin-induced \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 inside-out signaling process. In contrast, \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 outside-in signaling process was not altered in PP1c\u03b3 null mice as revealed by normal adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen. Intravital microscopy revealed that the thrombus formation induced by a light/dye injury in the cremaster muscle venules was significantly (P=0.03) delayed in PP1c\u03b3 null mice compared to wild type mice. These studies illustrates that PP1c\u03b3 is an essential component of thrombin signaling that is downstream of protease activated receptors and promotes thrombus formation in part by supporting soluble fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation.",
