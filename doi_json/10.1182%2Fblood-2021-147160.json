    "abstract_text": "Introduction: CC-90009 is a novel cereblon E3 ligase modulator (CELMoD \u00ae ) agent that is a first-in-class degrader of translation termination factor G1 to S phase transition 1 (GSPT1). CC-90009 has demonstrated antileukemic activity as a single agent and is currently under investigation in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; NCT02848001). Treatment with CC-90009 led to rapid reductions in peripheral and bone marrow blasts, and demonstrated preliminary promising efficacy, including several complete remissions, in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. Here, we describe the identification and preclinical activity of select anti-AML agents as potential combination partners of CC-90009 to further improve its efficacy and therapeutic index. Based on these results, the combination activity of CC-90009 with venetoclax (VEN)/azacitidine (AZA) is being evaluated in a phase 1/2 trial in patients with AML (NCT04336982). Methods: A high-throughput cell viability screen was performed to identify synergistic partners of CC-90009. AML cell lines (HL-60, HNT-34, KG-1, ML-2, NOMO-1, MOLM-13, MV4-11, F-36P, OCI-AML2, OCI-AML3) were treated with CC-90009 in combination with > 70 compounds, including standard anti-AML agents, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), unfolded protein response inducers, transcription inhibitors, and epigenetic agents. MOLM-13 and MV4-11 are fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) cell lines. Hits were validated in a colony formation (CF) assay using primary AML cells and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) from healthy donors. Synergy of the combination partners with CC-90009 was further assessed in AML patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Synergy between the isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) inhibitor enasidenib and CC-90009 was evaluated in a TF-1 erythroleukemia cell line overexpressing IDH2 R140Q mutant, and an IDH2 R140Q PDX model, AM7577. Results: Our high-throughput combination screen revealed multiple TKIs, epigenetic agents, and pro-apoptotic agents as potential combination partners of CC-90009 in AML cell lines. FLT3 inhibitors, including sunitinib, pexidartinib, midostaurin, lestaurtinib, crenolanib, and gilteritinib, synergized with CC-90009 to reduce viability in FLT3-ITD AML cell lines MV4-11 and MOLM-13. Similarly, the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitor VEN potentiated CC-90009-induced apoptosis and accelerated cell-autonomous killing. Reduction in levels of MCL-1, an anti-apoptotic factor, by CC-90009 most likely contributed to the synergy with VEN. We prioritized the evaluation of FLT3, BCL2, and IDH2 inhibitors as partners of CC-90009. In CF assays, midostaurin enhanced the inhibitory effect of CC-90009 in primary AML cells, without augmenting the effect of CC-90009 in CD34+ BMMC from healthy donors. Similarly, VEN enhanced the reduction in CF by CC-90009 in AML patient-derived BMMC without exacerbating the decrease in CF by CC-90009 in BMMC from healthy donors. We characterized FLT3 inhibitor/CC-90009 and BCL2 inhibitor/AZA/CC-90009 combinations in a FLT3-ITD PDX murine model, PDX1. The FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib significantly prolonged survival when combined with CC-90009 compared with either agent alone ( P < 0.001). Similarly, VEN/AZA/CC-90009 combination markedly extended survival compared with single agents or VEN/AZA doublets ( P < 0.001). The synergy between CC-90009 and epigenetic modulators was validated and further characterized in customized cell differentiation assays. Addition of CC-90009 to enasidenib, a mutant IDH2 inhibitor, enhanced differentiation and killing of CD34+ stem and progenitor cells, and increased differentiated CD235a+ erythroblasts, compared with enasidenib alone in a TF-1 cell line overexpressing IDH2 R140Q. Enasidenib/CC-90009 combination treatment reduced CD45+ malignant populations and increased differentiated CD14+ cells, leading to significantly prolonged animal survival in an IDH2 R140Q PDX model, AM7577, compared with either agent alone ( P < 0.0001). Conclusion: Using a high-throughput combination screen, we identified rational combination partners that synergize with CC-90009 in in vitro and in vivo AML models. Collectively, these results support the clinical evaluation of CC-90009 in combination with FLT3, BCL2, and IDH2 inhibitors to further improve treatment outcomes for patients with AML.
