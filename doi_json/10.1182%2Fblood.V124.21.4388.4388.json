    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The appropriate classification of bone marrow (BM) failure syndromes in children is challenging, particularly in relation to histological distinction between aplastic anemia (AA), refractory cytopenia of childhood (RCC), and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD). The goal of this study is to characterize the molecular pathogenesis of these conditions by identifying the full spectrum of gene mutations in 29 children with three diseases using whole-exome sequencing. Patients and Methods: Wediagnosed AA, RCC, or RCMD on the basis of morphology and histological findings of bone marrow (BM) according to the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification criteria. Patients with AA exhibited hypocellular BM and no morphologically dysplastic changes in any of three hematopoietic cell lineages, while patients with RCC had 10% in one cell lineage. Patients with RCMD exhibited >10% dysplastic changes in two or more cell lineages. We obtained peripheral blood and BM samples from 29 children (16 boys and 13 girls) with AA (n = 8), RCC (n = 11), or RCMD (n = 10). The median age at diagnosis was 11 years (range, 2\u201315 years). We performed exome capture from paired DNA (non-T cells/CD3 + lymphocytes) using SureSelect\u00ae Human All Exon V4 kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), which covered all part of the coding exons, followed by massively-parallel sequencing using HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Candidate somatic mutations and germline variants were detected through our pipeline for whole-exome sequencing (Genomon-exome). All candidate somatic nucleotide changes were validated by Sanger sequencing. The ethics committee of Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine approved this study. Results: Whole-exome sequencing pipeline identified a total of 14 non-synonymous somatic (one nonsense, 11 missense, and two frameshift) changes among the 29 patients, which resulted in only 0.48 mutations per patient. The average numbers of somatic mutations per sample were not significantly different among these groups (0.50 in AA, 0.36 in RCC, and 0.60 in RCMD). As a whole, childhood AA, RCC, and RCMD were characterized by a paucity of somatic mutations compared with adult myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in which 10 or more mutations per exome were detected on average. Among the mutated genes, BCOR -inactivating mutations in two patients (p.S158fs in AA and p.E1286X in RCMD) were considered significant genetic events based on previous reports that it is a driver gene in MDS. With regard to germline events, we did not detect any germline mutations of inherited BM failure syndromes. Moreover, we did not identifiy significantly frequent germline events in the entire cohort or any genetic hallmarks to be able to discriminate between these three diseases. When comparing the clinical outcomes of patients with somatic mutations (n = 7) versus those without somatic mutations (n = 22), response rate to immunosuppressive therapy at 6 months (50% vs. 50%), 5-year clonal evolution rate (95% confidential interval) [0% (0%) vs. 6% (0%\u201326%)], and the 5-year overall survival rate (95% confidential interval) [100% (100%\u2013100%) vs. 95% (70%\u201399%)] were not significantly different. Conclusion: We usedwhole-exome sequencing analysis for gene mutational profiling of children with AA, RCC, and RCMD. Idiopathic bone marrow failure syndromes in children are characterized by a paucity of somatic gene mutations, irrespective of histological diagnosis. These findings suggest that histological diagnosis based on the WHO classification system does not discriminate the mutational profile of idiopathic BM failure syndromes in children.
