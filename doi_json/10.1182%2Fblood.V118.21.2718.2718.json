    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2718 Background: Inotuzumab ozogamicin (INO) is a humanized anti-CD22 antibody conjugated to cytotoxic calicheamicin. In a prior study, INO combined with rituximab (INO+R) had an overall response rate (ORR) of 78% in patients (pts) with relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who were not candidates for high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplant (HDT-aSCT). An ORR of \u223c20% was seen in pts with refractory aggressive lymphoma. Objectives: Safety and activity of INO+R followed by HDT-aSCT in relapsed/refractory DLBCL pts. Primary endpoint: ORR. Secondary endpoints: successful peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection, aSCT rate, progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Patients, Treatment: CD20+/CD22+ B cell DLBCL, HDT-aSCT eligible, \u22652 adverse prognostic factors (prior R exposure, early relapse/persistent disease with prior therapy, sIPI \u22652). R 375 mg/m 2 on day (d) 1, INO 1.8 mg/m 2 on d 2 every 21 d, up to 6 cycles; PBSC mobilization with G-CSF (+/\u2212 plerixafor injection) on d \u22658, cycle 2. Chemo-priming if insufficient PBSC collected by G-CSF and after response observed. INO+R responders with >2\u00d710 6 CD34+ cells/kg proceed to HDT-aSCT. Results: 63 pts were enrolled; 61 received INO+R in this ongoing trial. Median age was 60 y (range 19\u201375 y); 46% had 1 prior therapy, 41% had 2, and 11% had \u22653. Pts had adverse prognostic factors: 100% prior R treatment; 78% sIPI \u22652 (range 0\u20134); 25% had no response to most recent prior therapy, 60% responded with early relapse/failure (12 mo, early relapse/failure (2\u00d710 6 CD34+PBSC/kg (range 2.1\u20137.1 \u00d710 6 /kg): 7 mobilized with G-CSF, 6 with G-CSF + plerixafor, 3 with G-CSF + chemo-priming (2 also received plerixafor). Five pts collected <2\u00d710 6 CD34+ PBSC/kg, including 1 with PD prior to collection attempt and 1 with insufficient counts to initiate apheresis (12 mo had longer PFS than those with early relapse/failure or no response (median 12.8, 2.1, 2.7 mo, respectively). Pts who underwent HDT-aSCT had 6- and 12-mo PFS rates of 79% and 35%, respectively (median 10 mo); median OS not reached. Common adverse events during INO+R treatment: thrombocytopenia (68%), nausea (46%), lymphopenia (41%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (38%), fatigue (38%), neutropenia (30%), pyrexia (29%), and vomiting (24%). Two pts had veno-occlusive disease, each occurred after HDT-aSCT: 1 recovered without intervention, the other did not recover, ultimately dying from CMV complications (above). In addition, 26 other deaths occurred: 22 due to PD, 2 due to infection after HDT-aSCT (1 neutropenic sepsis pre-engraftment, 1 sepsis post-engraftment), 1 due to neutropenic sepsis (death 77 d after last INO dose), and 1 attributed to complications of pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (death 101 d after last INO dose). Conclusion: In this selected high-risk population with relapsed/refractory DLBCL, INO+R shows activity and a 12-mo PFS rate of 35% after aSCT. The safety profile was most notable for some toxicities (hematologic, infectious, and hepatic) after aSCT. Further follow-up is required to assess long-term impact after aSCT.
