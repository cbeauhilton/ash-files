    "abstract_text": "Background: Engineered toxin bodies (ETBs) are comprised of a proprietarily engineered form of Shiga-like toxin A subunit (SLT-A) genetically fused to antibody-like binding domains. ETBs work through novel mechanisms of action and are capable of forcing internalization, self-routing through intracellular compartments to the cytosol, and inducing potent cell-kill via the enzymatic and permanent inactivation by SLT-A of ribosomes. MT-3724 represents a novel ETB modality comprised of an anti-CD20 single-chain variable fragment genetically fused to SLT-A, is capable of efficient internalization once bound to CD20 and can induce potent direct cell-kill via enzymatic ribosome inactivation. In a Phase 1/1b dose escalation/expansion study of MT-3724 monotherapy in subjects with heavily pretreated (including CD20 monoclonal antibodies) relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/rNHL) the most common grade \u22653 treatment-related adverse events were myalgia and neutropenia (n=3 each). Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were indicative of innate immune response. In subjects with negative rituximab serum concentrations there was a 38% objective response rate (Hamlin et al. ASH 2019). MT-3724 is currently being studied in five ongoing (three actively recruiting, two in development) Phase 2 studies for r/rNHL. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of MT-3724 in two cohorts of subjects with r/r mantle cell lymphoma (r/rMCL). Study Design and Methods: This phase 1, multicenter, open-label, single arm study will include adults \u226518 yrs with histologically confirmed r/rMCL (histology plus expression of Cyclin D1 in association with CD20 and CD5 or evidence of t(11:14)) who have received \u22652 prior systemic therapies (including anti-CD20 antibody alone or in combination with other agents) and have \u22651 measurable lesion (Lugano criteria). Subjects with CNS involvement or recent treatment with rituximab (within 84 days of study initiation; if received within 12-37 weeks of start of treatment, serum rituximab level must be confirmed to be negative [<500 ng/mL]), obinutuzumab (within 184 days), or ofatumumab (within 88 days) will be excluded. The washout period for these anti-CD20 antibodies, based on published half-life data for these agents, is required due to direct binding competition with MT-3724 for the same CD20 epitope. The primary objective is to evaluate safety and determine the RP2D of MT-3724 in subjects with r/rMCL. Secondary objectives include overall response rate based on the Lugano criteria as determined by the investigators, duration of response, disease control rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, PK, PD, and immunogenicity. An exploratory endpoint will assess if responders become eligible for potentially curative therapy (rate of bridge-to-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or bridge-to-chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy). Subjects will receive escalating doses of MT-3724 as a one hr IV infusion in cycle (C) 1 on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 18, and 25. In C2+, subjects will receive the highest MT-3724 dose on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle. Two sequential cohorts will be studied. The study will be initiated with Cohort 1 to evaluate DLTs during the first 42 days of therapy. Subjects will have a dose increase only if they do not experience DLTs and dose reductions will be permitted for treatment-related toxicities. If Cohort 1 is deemed tolerable, Cohort 2 (higher doses) will begin; if Cohort 1 dosing is not tolerable, Cohort 0 (lower doses) will begin ( Table 1 ). A Bayesian optimal interval design will be used to identify the RP2D more accurately (target toxicity rate \u03c6=0.3). Enrollment is anticipated to begin in December 2020.
