    "abstract_text": "Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) is a life-threatening disease in which intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is the major risk. Although thrombocytopenia caused by maternal antibodies against \u03b23 integrin and occasionally against other platelet antigens (e.g. GPIb\u03b1) has long been assumed to be the cause of bleeding, the mechanism of ICH has never been adequately explored. Utilizing murine models of FNAIT and a high frequency ultrasound imaging system, we found that ICH only occurred in fetuses and neonates with anti-\u03b23 integrin- but not anti-GPIb\u03b1-mediated FNAIT, despite similar thrombocytopenia in both groups. Only anti-\u03b23 integrin-mediated FNAIT reduced brain and retina vessel density, impaired angiogenic signalling, and increased endothelial cell apoptosis; which were abrogated by maternal administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). ICH and impairment of retinal angiogenesis was further reproduced in neonates by injection of anti-\u03b23 integrin- but not anti-GPIb\u03b1-antisera. Utilizing cultured human endothelial cells, we found that cell proliferation, network formation, and Akt phosphorylation were inhibited only by murine anti-\u03b23 integrin-antisera and human anti-HPA-1a IgG purified from mothers with FNAIT children. Our data suggest fetal hemostasis is unique in that impairment of angiogenesis rather than thrombocytopenia is likely the cause of ICH; importantly maternal IVIG therapy can effectively prevent this devastating disorder.
