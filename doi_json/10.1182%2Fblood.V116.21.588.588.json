    "abstract_text": "Abstract 588 We recently defined a novel role of histone deacetylase 11 (HDAC11), the newest member of the HDAC family, as a negative regulator of IL-10 gene transcription in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). 1 To better understand the role of HDAC11 gene expression in immune cells in vivo , we have utilized a BAC (Bacterial artificial chromosome) transgenic mouse in which the EGFP reporter gene was inserted downstream of the HDAC11 promoter region but immediately upstream of the HDAC11 coding sequence (TgHDAC11-EGFP mice). 2 In the steady-state, macrophages and B-cells isolated from spleen of TgHDAC11-EGFP mice express low levels of HDAC11 as evidenced by a slight shift in EGFP fluorescence from background. In sharp contrast, we identified a discrete population (11.9%) of T-cells over-expressing HDAC11 as demonstrated both by flow cytometry for EGFP and by qRT-PCR for HDAC11, a majority of which were CD4 + T-cells. Sorting of this EGFP + , CD4 + T-cell population confirmed that the increased EGFP expression correlated with an increased HDAC11mRNA expression. Reminiscent of our prior data in APCs, the increased expression of HDAC11 in T-cells was also inversely correlated with IL-10mRNA expression. Further analyses revealed that in the absence of any stimulation or T-cell polarizing conditions, this EGFP positive population expressed significantly elevated levels of ROR-\u03b3t and IL-17 mRNA, markers specific for the TH17 subpopulation. Polarization of wild type CD4 + T-cells into functional TH17 cells was associated with reduction of HDAC11 expression, suggesting a potential role for HDAC11 in regulating T-cell function and/or activation, in particular within the TH17 subset. Further support for this regulatory role of HDAC11 has been provided by our additional findings that T-cells devoid of HDAC11 are indeed hyper-reactive in vitro and in in vivo models. 1.
