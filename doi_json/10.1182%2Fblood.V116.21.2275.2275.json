    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2275 Background: Dasatinib is known to induce large granular lymphocyte (LGL) expansion, which correlates with better clinical efficacy. The current retrospective study attempted to investigate the incidence of lymphocytosis following second-line dasatinib therapy in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and to analyze the clinical factors predictive of the development of lymphocytosis, as well as association with treatment outcomes. Method: Fifty CML patients who failed imatinib treatment and received dasatinib for 3 months or more, were enrolled from 9 centers in the Republic of Korea. The cumulative incidence of lymphocytosis was assessed, and cytogenetic and molecular response, treatment failure, loss of response, progression to advanced disease, and survival were evaluated and analyzed according to the development of lymphocytosis. Results: After a median of 17 months of dasatinib therapy, complete cytogenetic (CCR) and major molecular response (MMR) was noted in 23 and 16 patients, respectively. Twenty three patients (46%) developed lymphocytosis following dasatinib therapy (median onset 4 months). No clinical predictive factor for the development of lymphocytosis was found. The cytogenetic response was significantly better in the group that developed lymphocytosis (LC+), as compared to the group without lymphocytosis (LC-); the LC+ group showed a higher complete cytogenetic response (CCyR; 78.3% vs. 29.6%, p=0.001) and major molecular response (MMR; 52.2% vs. 14.8%, p=0.005), in comparison to the LC- group. The development of lymphocytosis after dasatinib was identified as a favorable independent marker for predicting a CCyR (p=0.002) or MMR following dasatinib therapy (p=0.003). Conclusion: The present study suggested that 1) lymphocytosis following dasatinib therapy is not rare phenomenon with incidence of 46%; 2) it might be associated with higher response following dasatinib therapy. Further study is necessary to identify which subset of lymphocytes was expanded and to reveal the exact mechanism by which dasatinib induces lymphocyte expansion.
