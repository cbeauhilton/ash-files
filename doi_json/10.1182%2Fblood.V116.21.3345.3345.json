The EPO receptor (EPO-R) is expressed by erythroid cells and by several non-hematopoietic cell types including various neoplastic cells. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are used clinically for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia. The results of some recent randomized clinical trials have reported an increased incidence in adverse events and reduced survival in ESA-treated metastatic breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, potentially related to EPO-induced cancer progression. These results have raised concerns over ESA treatment in metastatic cancer patients. However, very little pre-clinical data is available regarding the impact of EPO on breast cancer metastasis. The goal of the current study was therefore to determine if EPO can influence the malignant behavior of breast cancer cells and/or influence the metastatic process. Methods: MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, and 4T-1 breast cancer cell lines were treated with recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO; 10 U/ml) or control media and screened for EPO-R mRNA expression levels by RT-PCR, and for EPO-R protein expression by Western blot and flow cytometry. MDA-MB-231 (231) and MDA-MB-435 (435) cell lines were used for functional assays in vitro and in vivo . Untreated or rHuEPO treated cells were grown in 2D and 3D in vitro systems (standard tissue culture plates and 0.6% soft agar, respectively) to determine if rHuEPO influenced growth. In vitro cell survival was also assessed in response to treatment with rHuEPO in the presence or absence of paclitaxel chemotherapy (10mg/ml), radiation (10G), or hypoxic conditions (1% O 2 ). Following mammary fat pad injection, in vivo effects of rHuEPO (300U/kg) alone or in combination with paclitaxel treatment (10mg/kg) were assessed in mouse models of tumorigenicity and spontaneous metastasis. Results: Expression analysis of EPO-R mRNA and protein revealed a large variation in levels across different cell lines. The majority of cell lines did not express cell surface EPO-R by flow cytometry, although two cell lines (231 and 435) did show weak expression of EPO-R mRNA, with only the 231 cell line showing EPO-R expression by Western blot. In vitro, a small protective effect from rHuEPO on radiation-treated 435 cells was seen (p<0.05); however, rHuEPO treatment alone or combined with chemotherapy or hypoxia did not cause a significant increase in cell survival relative to untreated controls cells. In contrast, in vivo studies demonstrated that rHuEPO increased the incidence and burden of lung metastases in immunocompromised mice injected with 231 or 435 cells and treated with paclitaxel relative to mice treated with paclitaxel alone (p<0.05). Conclusions: The lack of an in vitro effect of rHuEPO highlights the importance of in vivo studies to delineate the effects of EPO on the metastatic process. Our novel findings demonstrate that rHuEPO can reduce the efficacy of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting in vivo , and in some cases enhance the inherent metastatic growth potential of human breast cancer cells.
