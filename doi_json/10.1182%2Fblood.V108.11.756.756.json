    "abstract_text": "New immunosuppressive compounds are currently investigated to reduce the rate of lethal Graft-versus-Host disease (GvHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation without adding relevant toxicity. Although positive reports on the efficacy of Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) in patients with acute and chronic GvHD are available, there is only limited data on the optimal prophylactic dosing schedule in patients at high risk for GvHD. Since very low trough-levels of MPA are measured in recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplants, we performed a prospective phase I/II trial targeting daily MMF doses according to MPA AUC levels determined at several time-points after transplantation. Twenty-nine patients (18 male, 11 female) with a median age of 53 years were included. The indication for allogeneic transplantation from matched sibling (n=7) and unrelated donors (9/10 alleles matched as minimum requirement; n=22) was high-risk AML/MDS (n=19) or relapsed lymphoma/multiple myeloma (n=10). Conditioning therapy included 30 mg/m 2 Fludarabine on days \u22129 to \u22126 (4 x 20 mg/m 2 ) combined with intravenous Busulfan 3.45 mg/kg from day \u22125 to day \u22122 (4 x 3.45 mg/kg i.v.). Tacrolimus was given orally starting on day \u22121 at 0.03 mg/kg in order to achieve trough blood levels of 5\u201310 ng/ml. MMF was started on day 1 at 1500 mg intravenously every 12 hours. AUC measurements of mycophenolic acid (MPA) and its metabolite MPAG by HPLC were scheduled on day 3, 8, 14, 21 and 28 after transplantation. The MMF dose was modified in order to achieve an AUC of 35\u201360 \u03bcg/m*h. MMF was tapered from day 56 on, if possible The dose of MMF had to be increased in 15/29 (52%) patients to 1750\u20132500 mg every 12 hours on day 4. No patient required a reduction of dosing on day 4. With the respective dose adjustments 52% and 80% of patients reached the AUC target on day 8 and 14, respectively. There was no direct association between dose level and extramedullary toxicity. Early grade 3\u20134 gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 4 patients and lead to a reduction of MMF back to 1000 mg every 12 hours. Trilineage engraftment and complete donor chimerism was observed in all patients included. Only one out seven patients with a matched related donor experienced acute GvHD > grade II. The respective proportion of grade III\u2013IV acute GvHD in the unrelated setting was 7/20 (33%). The rate of viral (CMV) and fungal infections was not increased compared to historical controls using standard antimicrobial prophylaxis. With a median follow-up of 18 months 15 (52%) patients are alive and 14 are in complete remission. Reasons for death were relapse (n=5; 17%), pneumonia/sepsis (n=2; 7%), GvHD (n=5; 17%) and organ failure (n=2; 7%). So far, 8 out of 24 evaluable patients (33%) suffer from limited (n=3) or extensive (n=5) chronic GvHD. A retrospective analysis revealed a significant correlation between C max levels and the AUC for MPA. The respective target C max was shown to be 16 \u03bcg/ml. Given the high-risk patient population and the high proportion of unrelated donors (70%) the clinical results observed with the combination of tacrolimus and MMF as prophylactic regimen are encouraging. The regimen has to be optimised for recipients of unrelated transplants. MMF doses of up to 2500 mg every 12 hours can be infused early after stem cell transplantation without an increased risk of toxicity. A simplified MMF targeting strategy based on MPA C max levels seems to be warranted in future trials."
