    "abstract_text": "We retrospectively compared the impact of treatments based on thalidomide, bortezomib or tranditional regimen (VAD) on renal function recovery in a consecutive, unselected population of newly diagnosed myeloma patients presenting with renal failure. Between May 2005 and February 2014, 130 (24.3%) patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and RI were treated upfront with VAD or a novel agent containing regimen and all received a similar supportive care in our single center. A complete recovery of renal function(renal complete response )was observed in 56.1% of patients treated with bortezomib, in 38.9% with thalidomide and in 28.6% with VAD (P=0.033), a significant improvement of renal function (\u2265renalPR (renal partial response)) was observed in 63.6% of patients treated with bortezomib, in 66.1% with thalidomide and in 42.9% with VAD (P=0.162). There has a significantly difference in the rates and quality of renal response among patients with different quality of myeloma response: renal CR rates for patients who achieved \u2265VGPR, PR, MR or NR were 63.1% vs 46.8% vs 35.7% vs 25.8%, P<0.05, respectively. eGFR \u226530 ml/min and myeloma response higher than PR were independently associated with a higher probability of major renal response in the multivariate analysis. The median follow-up for all patients was 36.5 months and the median survival was 74 months. The median survival for patients of groups B,T and VAD was79 months,71 months and 39 months, respectively (P=0.007). Patients died within the first 2 months from initiation of therapy and the corresponding frequencies in groups B, T and VAD were 0%, 2.8% and 17.9%, respectively (P<0.05). In multivariate analyses on survival, myeloma response higher than PR and new agents-based therapy are identified independent prognostic factors. For newly diagnosed myeloma patients with RI, bortezomib or thalidomide based regimen should be selected promptly to achieve rapid effective myeloma rate and high rates of renal recovery.
