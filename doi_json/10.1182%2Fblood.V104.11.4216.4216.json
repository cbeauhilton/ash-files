    "abstract_text": "Despite many apparently contradictory reports, IFN-\u03b3 is well known as a hematopoiesis-inhibitory cytokine and is implicated in the pathogenesis of aplastic anemia. It has been shown that IFN-\u03b3 intrinsically and simultaneously induces specific and conflicting signalling pathways and transcriptional programs that contribute to the potential dual effects of IFN-\u03b3 in promoting or inhibiting proliferation of murine pro-B cells ( Asao et al, J Biol Chem  275 : 867 , 2000 ). We explored the dual roles of IFN-\u03b3 in the inhibition or promotion of the survival and growth of hematopoietic progenitors, especially with regard to interactions with stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). IFN-\u03b3 partially rescued normal bone marrow CD34+ cells and colony-forming cells from apoptosis induced by serum- and growth factor-deprivation. SDF-1 further enhanced cell survival, in synergy with IFN-\u03b3. Short-term IFN-\u03b3 treatment of CD34+ cells enhanced the clonal growth of the cells in synergy with SDF-1. In contrast, IFN-\u03b3 inhibited the clonal growth of hematopoietic progenitor cells in a standard methylcellulose clonogenic assay and inhibited the growth factor-mediated survival of normal CD34+ cells, CD34+ cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia, and MO7e cells. The addition of SDF-1 did not alter these outcomes. IFN-\u03b3 did not activate PI3K/Akt, enhance SDF-1-induced activation of PI3K/Akt, or up-regulate the expression of CXCR4 or its chemotactic function in bone marrow CD34+ cells. IFN-\u03b3 up-regulated the expression of Socs1 mRNA in CD34+ cells and MO7e cells. Referring to a previous report describing that Socs1 binds to multiple signalling proteins and suppresses stem cell factor-dependent proliferation of bone marrow-derived mast cells (De Sepulveda et al, EMBO J 18: 904,1999), it is suggested that IFN-\u03b3-induced inhibition of the growth factor-dependent survival of CD34+ cells might be mediated, at least in part, through the induction of Socs1. Paradoxically, IFN-\u03b3 down-regulated SDF-1 production in primary human bone marrow stromal cells. These results indicate that IFN-\u03b3, partly in concert with SDF-1, exerts dual effects on the survival and growth of hematopoietic progenitor cells; the effects of IFN-\u03b3 on hematopoietic progenitor cells can differ depending on the particular in vitro experimental conditions, especially the presence of hematopoietic growth factors."
