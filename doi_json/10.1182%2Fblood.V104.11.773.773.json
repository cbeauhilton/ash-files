    "abstract_text": "V3-21 gene usage defines a distinct genetic subgroup of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) characterized by a poor clinical outcome regardless of the VH mutation status. V3-21 cases exhibit a highly characteristic B-cell receptor (BCR) structure as demonstrated by homologous CDR3 sequences and a restricted use of VL genes implicating a common antigen involved in tumor pathogenesis of this specific CLL subgroup. To investigate the role of antigenic stimulation in the pathogenesis of V3-21 using CLL, we analyzed the quantitative expression of genes involved in BCR signaling (ZAP-70, SYK, BLNK, LYN, PI3K, PLCG2, FOS), B-cell activation (TRAF3, STAT6, NFKB), and cell cycle or apoptosis control (ATM, BCL-2, BAX, CDK4, CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, p27, E2F1, MYC) in V3-21 cases in comparison to VH mutated (VH MUT) and VH unmutated (VH UM) cases not using the V3-21 gene. To obtain native expression signatures we studied a non-CD19-purified (nPU) cohort (V3-21: 18 cases, equally divided into VH mutated and VH unmutated cases; VH MUT: 17; VH UM: 19) and, for verification, a CD19-purified (PU) cohort (V3-21: 10 cases, equally divided into VH mutated and unmutated; VH MUT: 12; VH UM: 16) to exclude a contamination of the results by non-tumor cells. All cases were analyzed by FISH for +3q, 6q-, +8q, 11q-, +12q, 13q-, 17p-, and t(11;14) to avoid major imbalances of genomic alterations between the subgroups under study. As expected, ZAP-70 expression was higher in VH UM as compared to VH MUT cases in the nPU (p=0.007) as well as the PU cohort (p=0.009). V3-21 cases showed a higher ZAP-70 expression as compared to VH MUT (nPU: p=0.033; PU: p=0.038). This applied also when restricting this comparison to V3-21 mutated cases (nPU: p=0.018). Median ZAP-70 expression in the PU cohort was 1.15 in VH MUT vs. 7.69 in VH UM cases, as compared to 7.05 in V3-21 cases (V3-21 mutated cases: 10.69; V3-21 unmutated: 6.7). Other genes differentially expressed between the V3-21 and VH MUT subgroups in nPU cases were PI3K (p=0.048), PLCG2 (p=0.007), CCND2 (p=0.003), p27 (p=0.003), BCL-2 (p=0.025), and ATM (p=0.006). In addition, a set of genes was detected with a differential expression between V3-21 and VH UM (nPU) including PLCG2 (p=0.014), NFKB (p=0.023), CCND2 (p=0.001), p27 (0.002), and BAX (p=0.028). Notably, except for ZAP-70, all of the differentially expressed genes showed a lower expression in V3-21 as compared to the other subgroups. When comparing the V3-21 mutated and V3-21 unmutated subgroups (nPU), there were no significant gene expression differences except for CDK4, which showed a lower expression in V3-21 unmutated cases. Therefore, cases with V3-21 usage appear to show a rather homogeneous gene expression pattern independently of the VH mutation status, which can be distinguished from VH MUT and VH UM cases not using V3-21. The expression differences observed suggest a role of differential BCR signaling in the pathogenesis of this distinct CLL subgroup. Deregulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, and candidate genes such as ATM indicate the involvement of additional pathways in the pathogenesis of CLL cases using V3-21.",
