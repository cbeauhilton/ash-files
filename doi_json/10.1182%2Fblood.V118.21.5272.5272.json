    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5272 Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, is the most common erythroenzymopathy of glycolytic pathway (prevalence of 1:20,000) associated with chronic non spherocytic hemolytic anemia from mild to severe. More than 180 mutations in the PK-LR gene have been so far reported, and genotype-phenotype correlation has been established for some of them. Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) is the most common congenital hemolytic anemia in Caucasians, with an estimated prevalence ranging from 1:2000 to 1:5000. The main clinical features are hemolytic anemia from compensated to severe, variable jaundice, splenomegaly and cholelythiasis. The molecular defect is highly heterogeneous, caused by proteins involved in the attachment of cytoskeleton to the membrane integral domain (spectrin, ankyrin, band 3 and protein 4.2). We describe a case of PK deficiency associated with HS. The propositus was a 13 years-old Italian male with neonatal jaundice and need of blood transfusion (Hb 5.8 g/dL) during an infectious episode. At the time of the study Hb was 13.9 g/dL, MCV 81.8 fL, reticulocytes 207\u00d710 9 /L, unconjugated bilirubin 2.16 mg/dL, LDH 605 U/L, haptoglobin <20 mg/dL. The peripheral blood smear examination showed the presence of spherocytes (16%) and some ovalocytes (2%). The study of the most important red cell enzymes revealed reduced PK activity (59% of normal). Direct sequencing of PK-LR gene showed compound heterozygosity for the 994A mutation (Gly332Ser) and the \u2212148T variant localized the erythroid specific promoter region. The presence of spherocytes in peripheral blood smear prompted us to investigate for the coexistence of HS. Erythrocyte osmotic fragility was decreased and SDS\u2013PAGE analysis of red cell membrane proteins revealed a 30% spectrin reduction. Family study demonstrated a heterozygous condition for the 994A mutation in the father, who also displayed comparable enzyme deficiency, whereas promoter variant \u2212148T was detected in the mother and in the brother. No red cell membrane abnormalities were present in the family members, although positive EMA binding test and increased osmotic fragility were found in the father and brother. The co-existence of HS and PK deficiency is very rare event, only few cases are described to date. Clinical, family and molecular studies allowed the determination of the interrelationship between the two RBC abnormalities in the patient and his relatives. The reduced PK activity in the propositus and his father is justified by heterozygous 994A mutation. The more severe clinical picture in the propositus could be caused by the coexistence of HS and by the presence of \u2212148T mutation, that although it seems not to have effects on PK-LR mRNA expression, is often detected in PK deficient subjects with heterozygous PK mutations.
