    "abstract_text": "Objective: To study the distribution of CMV glycoprotein B (gB) genotypes in the patients with CMV infection after allo-HSCT Methods: Seventy-four patients undergoing allo-HSCT were enrolled in this study. After allo-HSCT, all the patients were detected for CMV gB DNA in peripheral blood by haplo-nested PCR methods;The CMV gB DNA positive samples were screened, which were sufficient for enzyme digestion. Glycoprotein B typing was performed through digesting PCR products with RsaIand HinfI;The sequences were mensurated with ABI PRISM 377 XL DNA Sequencer. Results: The PCR products of thirty-eight patients were digested with enzyme. the distribution of gB genotypes was as follows:I(gB1) 19/38 (50.0%), II(gB2) 3/38 (7.89%),III(gB3) 14/38 (36.84%), and unclassification 2/38 (5.27%). Conclusion: The distribution of gB genotypes was different in the patients with CMV infection after allo-HSCT; There may be exiting new genotype.",
