    "abstract_text": "Background : Approximately 40% of patients (pts) with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) have disease that will relapse or is refractory to chemotherapy and/or immunotherapies; management of these pts remains a challenge. Although follicular lymphoma (FL) generally responds well to first-line treatment (tx), this disease is characterized by frequent relapses with shorter intervals between tx lines. Pts with early relapse (ER) (progressive disease <2 y after initial diagnosis) and those who are double-refractory (DR) to both rituximab and chemotherapy, have particularly poor outcomes. Avadomide (CC-122) is a small molecule oral agent that induces cereblon-mediated degradation of the transcription factors Ikaros and Aiolos and promotes antilymphoma activity. Results from the dose-escalation part of the CC-122-NHL-001 study demonstrated preliminary antitumor activity of avadomide in combination with obinutuzumab in pts with relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) FL. Here, we report long-term safety and efficacy results from the dose-escalation and dose-expansion parts of the CC-122-NHL-001 study in pts with R/R FL. Methods : CC-122-NHL-001 (NCT02417285) is an ongoing, open-label, phase 1b study of avadomide in combination with obinutuzumab conducted at 8 sites in 3 European countries with dose-escalation and dose-expansion parts in R/R FL. Eligible pts (age \u226518 y) had histologically confirmed, CD20-positive R/R NHL. Pts with FL (grade 1, 2, or 3a) had \u22651 prior standard regimen. Avadomide active ingredient in capsule (1.0-4.0 mg) or formulated capsules (3.0 or 4.0 mg) was administered orally once daily on days 1-5 followed by 2 days off (5/7-day schedule) every week of each 28-day cycle. Obinutuzumab 1000 mg was given intravenously on days 2, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of cycles 2-8. Primary objectives were to determine the safety and tolerability of the combination, including the non-tolerated dose, maximum tolerated dose, and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Response was assessed using Cheson 2007 criteria every 2 cycles to cycle 6, then every 3 cycles to cycle 12, and every 6 cycles thereafter. Median duration of response (mDOR) and median progression-free survival (mPFS) were assessed by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Results : As of January 10, 2020, 73 pts with R/R NHL were enrolled and treated, including 19 with R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 1 with marginal zone lymphoma, and 53 with R/R FL; all 35 pts in the dose-expansion part of the study had R/R FL. The median age among treated pts was 61 y (range, 26-83), the median number of prior antilymphoma therapies was 3 (range 1-11), and 26 pts (36%) had prior autologous stem cell transplantation. As of July 14, 2020, tx was ongoing in 3/38 pts (8%) in dose-escalation (all ongoing in cycle >24, 1 pt ongoing in cycle >40). In the dose-expansion, tx was ongoing in 15/35 pts (43%); of these pts, all were ongoing in cycle >21 and 1 was ongoing in cycle 30. The RP2D of avadomide was established as 3.0 mg formulated capsule. In the expansion part of the study, pts received a median of 15 tx cycles (range, 1-33), and median tx duration was 60 wk (range, 1-132). The most common (\u226510%) grade 3/4 TEAEs were neutropenia, reported in 19 pts (54%) and thrombocytopenia, reported in 7 pts (20%). Sixteen pts (46%) had a serious TEAE; only pyrexia (11%) and sepsis (9%) occurred in >2 pts. The objective response rate (ORR) among the 35 pts with R/R FL in the dose-expansion part of the study was 71%, including 40% with a complete response (CR). The mDOR was 14.6 mo (95% CI, 14.6-not estimable [NE]), and mPFS was 16.4 mo (95% CI, 8.3-NE). The median duration of PFS follow-up in dose-expansion was 14.4 mo (range, 0.8-30.3). Two pts had CRs lasting 13.7 mo and 15.3 mo before discontinuation owing to receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Response rates were similar among all 53 R/R FL pts in both parts of the study (dose escalation and dose expansion) and in high-risk (ER and/or DR) FL pts (Table). Conclusions : Long-term follow-up results demonstrate that avadomide plus obinutuzumab has a manageable safety profile and durable responses in patients with R/R FL. The antitumor activity of cereblon modulators plus next-generation anti-CD20 antibodies in heavily pretreated R/R NHL warrants further investigation as a novel chemotherapy-free option.
