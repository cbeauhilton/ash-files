    "abstract_text": "Background: The progress of childhood BL and DLBCL has improved dramatically in the past three decades; however, patients with a 13q-deletion have a significantly poorer outcome (Cairo/Patte et al Blood, 2007 and Patte/Cairo et al Blood, 2007; Poirel/Cairo et al Leukemia 2008). DLEU1, a potential tumor suppressor gene, is located within the 13q-deletion. DLEU1 was reported to be a key gene in the Burkitt classifier genes (Dave/Staudt et al NEJM, 2006) and c-myc binds to the promoter region of DLEU1. DLEU1-network proteins include, among others, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (UBR1), Tubulin beta-2C (TUBB2C) and RASSF1A. We previously demonstrated that UBR1, TUBB2C, and RASSF1A, were differentially expressed in BL vs DLBCL patients and cell lines by global gene profiles and real time RT-PCR studies (Day/Cairo et al AACR 2008; Day/Cairo et al ICML 2008). We further demonstrated decreased expression of UBR1 (33.2\u00b14.5% reduction compared to control (p<0.02)) and TUBB2C (30.0\u00b13.5% reduction compared to control (p<0.001)) by DLEU1 gene siRNA knock down, while expression of RASSF1A was not changed (Day/Cairo, et al SIOP 2008). Taken together, these data suggest the hypothesis that DLEU1 interacting with UBR1 may interfere with microtubule function, and therefore act as a tumor repressor in c-myc-activated BL lymphomagenesis, by arrest of the cell cycle at G2/M and subsequent inducion of apoptosis. Objective: In this study, we investigated the role of DLEU1 in regulation of apoptosis in BL by inhibition of DLEU1 gene expression by a DLEU1 siRNA and evaluated it effects on the apoptotic rate in a BL cell line. Methods: The Ramos BL cell line was transiently transfected with a 25-nucleotide modified DLEU1 siRNA (5\u2032-AUACUUGGCAUGAAUGAACUUAUGU-3\u2032 and 3\u2032-UAUGAACCGUACUUACUUGAAUACA-5\u2032). Stealth RNAi whose GC content is similar to that of this DLEU1 siRNA was used as negative control. The transient transfection of DLEU1 siRNA (10 \u2013 20 nM) was achieved using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX. The transfection efficiency of siRNA was evaluated using Alexa Fluor Red Fluorescent Oligo. DLEU1 contents were measured by qRT-PCR with ddCt relative quantitative determination. GAPDH was used as endogenous control. Statistical analysis was conducted by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test. To determine the early and late stages of apoptosis, we transfected Ramos BL cells with DLEU1 siRNA, and then incubated cells with Annexin V-FITC and Propidium Iodide for 15 minutes, respectively (BD Pharmingen), followed by FACS using BD LSRII with FACSDiva. Results: The DLEU1 siRNA decreased the expression of DLEU1 RNA (52\u00b113%; p<0.0006). The transfection efficiency of siRNA was 85 \u2013 90%. Comparing to untreated cells, DLEU1 siRNA treatment significantly reduced early apoptosis (16.90\u00b10.37%; p<0.001) and late stage apoptosis (14.70\u00b10.27%; p<0.0001). Conclusion: These results suggest that when DLEU1 gene expression is decreased in BL cells, there is a significant reduction in both early and late apoptosis. The results strongly support a relationship between DLEU1 gene and regulation of BL apoptotic mechanisms. In concert with previous investigations, this data suggests that DLEU1 may function as a tumor growth repressor via UBR1 and TUBB2C-regulated mechanism in the cellular apoptotic process. Since c-myc binds promoter region of DLEU1 and these two genes are a part of the c-myc signaling network, this further underscores the importance of DLEU1 and its network proteins may play in c-myc-activated BL lymphomagenesis."
