    "abstract_text": "Background: Aggressive care at the end of life (EOL) leads to unnecessary suffering and healthcare costs for patients with cancer. We have previously shown that among patients with solid tumor malignancies, EOL utilization of chemotherapy, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and >1 emergency department (ED) visits are higher in Washington State vs Alberta (AB). In this study, we use cancer registry and claims data to compare EOL care among patients with hematological malignancies between western Washington (WW) and AB. Methods: Adult patients with hematological malignancies diagnosed between 2007 and 2017 who died before December 31, 2018 were identified from regional population-based cancer registries in WW and AB. Data sources were 1) WW Cancer Surveillance System (a regional SEER registry) with data from 13 counties linked to enrollment files and claims from four regional insurers and 2) Canada National Ambulatory Care Reporting System, Discharge Abstracts Database, and chemotherapy records from AB Health Services. Proportions of patients receiving chemotherapy, ICU admission, or >1 ED visit in the last 30 days of life (DOL) in WW and AB were determined among all patients and those \u226565 years and compared using two sample z-test with two-tailed hypothesis (\u03b1=0.006 after Bonferroni correction). Results: 7859 AB and 3767 WW patients met study inclusion criteria. Median age was 76 (IQR 66-83) and 79 (IQR 71-86) for AB and WW, respectively; 78% and 85% were over age 65, 33% and 59% with \u22652 Charlson Comorbidity Score. Cancer distribution was 33% (AB) and 54% (WW) non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 14% (AB) and 20% (WW) myeloma and 27% (AB) and 19% (AB) leukemia. Table 1 shows utilization of chemotherapy, >1 ED visits and ICU admissions in AB and WW for all patients and Table 2 in those \u226565 years. More patients in WW vs AB were treated with chemotherapy (21% WW vs 7% AB) and admitted to ICU (34% WW vs 9% AB) in the last 30 DOL, whereas multiple ED visits were more similar between WW and AB (17% vs 19%, respectively). Similarly, among patients \u226565 years, chemotherapy use and ICU admissions were higher in WW. The same was true for patients in the last 60 and 90 DOL. Conclusions: Similar to what was noted in solid tumor patients, intensity of healthcare use at EOL is greater in WW vs AB for patients with hematological malignancies. However, \u22651 ED visits were similar between populations. Further work is needed to understand drivers of high intensity healthcare use and identify interventions to minimize low value care at EOL.
