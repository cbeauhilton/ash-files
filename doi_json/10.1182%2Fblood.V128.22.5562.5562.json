    "abstract_text": "Introduction : BDNF is a neuronal growth factor that previously showed to exert survival effect in B cells. The role of BDNF in CLL is unknown. Objectives : To study the circulating levels of BDNF in CLL patients and their association with disease prognosis. We also looked for CXCR-4 as a possible mechanisms underlying BDNF effect in CLL. Design and methods : The total BDNF levels and the levels of the BDNF precursor; proBDNF were quantified in the serum of 36 CLL patients and 5 healthy controls by commercial ELISA kits (DY248 and DY3175 DuoSet, respectively, from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The patients' BDNF levels were correlated to the disease characteristics and clinical course. mRNA and protein expression of the high affinity receptor for BDNF; TrkB were evaluated by real time PCR and flow cytometry respectively. The effect of BDNF on CXCR4 surface expression and migration of CLL cells towards SDF-1 were studied in-vitro . Results : The total serum levels of BDNF in CLL patients was not statistically different compared to healthy controls (mean\u00b1SD; 19.9\u00b115.1ng/ml vs. 10.5\u00b19.5ng/ml respectively, p=0.19). Serum proBDNF levels in both CLL patients and healthy controls were under the detection limit of the kit. Within the CLL group we found higher total BDNF levels in patients with mutated immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain (IGHV) status than in patients with unmutated IGHV (25.2\u00b114.6ng/ml vs. 14.1\u00b113.0 in mutated and unmutated status, respectively, p=0.028). We also found higher serum levels of total BDNF in CLL patients in Binet stage A compared to those with a more advance clinical stage (mean\u00b1SD ; 24.5\u00b114.6ng/ml vs. 17.0\u00b116.9 and 10.2\u00b19.6 in A,B and C, respectively, p=0.013). Accordantly, higher BDNF levels were detected in patients who had a clinically stable disease compared to patients who had disease progression and required treatment (23.1\u00b114.7ng/ml vs. 13.4\u00b114.5, respectively, p=0.013). The mRNA levels of the BDNF receptor; TrkB, were twofold lower in CLL cells compared to normal B cells. However, the overall TrkB mRNA transcripts were very low in CLL cells and normal B cells compared to the normalized housekeeping genes of Beta-2-microglobulin and CD19. Likewise, surface expression of TrkB in CLL was undetectable using several commercial monoclonal Abs by flow cytometry. In vitro culture of CLL cells in serum free media for 24h resulted in an increased CXCR4 surface expression and greater apoptosis. Culture of CLL cells in the presence of recombinant BDNF (50ng/ml) resulted in downregulation CXCR-4 surface levels and protection from spontaneous apoptosis, irrespectively of the IGHV mutational status. The effect of BDNF on CXCR4 downregulation was also confirmed at 1h culture as it shows to induce similar effect to SDF-1 (50ng/ml) and additive effect when combined with SDF-1. Finally, possible competition between BDNF and SDF-1 was indicated as pretreatment of CLL cells with BDNF inhibit their migration toward SDF-1. Discussion : Our findings show association between high BDNF levels and favorable disease prognosis in CLL. Undetected TrkB expression in CLL cells is compatible with previous reports showing sequestration of TrkB in normal and malignant B cells and suggests TrkB independent effect of BDNF in CLL. The effect of BDNF on the survival and migration of CLL cells via CXCR-4 needs to be further investigated. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
