    "abstract_text": "Introduction Introduction of next-generation sequencing has defined the somatic mutational landscape in MDS. Comprehensive high-throughput structural variant profiling (SVP) is as important as mutation profiling in characterizing MDS clonal architecture since these large genomic aberrations have already shown to be critical for diagnosis and risk-stratification of MDS. A subset ( MECOM , KMT2A rearrangements) are therapeutic targets in clinical trials. At this time, technical advances in SVP for copy number alterations (CNAs) and fusions have not been congruent with mutation profiling due to the inability of short-read (150bp) NGS to detect SVs. Currently available long-read (10-20Kbp) and whole genome sequencing cannot detect all SVs due to the presence of repeat sequences. Hence, conventional karyotyping (CK) remains the gold standard. Optical genome mapping (OGM) is a novel single-platform technique that measures ultra-long-range sequence patterns (>300Kbp), thereby unaffected by repeat sequences, enabling unbiased evaluation of all types of SVs at a high resolution. Here, we performed comprehensive SVP and mutation profiling in a large well-characterized cohort of MDS. Methods We selected samples with available fresh/frozen BM cells from consecutive treatment-na\u00efve MDS pts who also underwent standard-of-care tests (CK, FISH, targeted 81-gene NGS for mutations). For OGM, ultra-high-molecular-weight-DNA was extracted, followed by labeling, linearization and imaging of DNA (Saphyr, Bionano) [median coverage:>300X]. The results were analyzed using de novo (>500 bp), rare variant (>5000 bp) and copy number (>500,000 bp) pipelines. The data was compared against 200 healthy controls to exclude common germline SVs. Clinical significance of the SVs was determined based on the location/overlap with the coding region of myeloid malignancy associated genes. The detection sensitivity was 10%. Results There were 76 treatment na\u00efve MDS patients. Baseline characteristics, comprehensive cytogenetic scoring system (CCSS) and R-IPPS risk categories and somatic mutations are in Fig 1 . OGM identified all clonal abnormalities detected by CK [CNAs, inversions, inter/intra-chromosomal translocations, dicentric, complex derivative chromosomes]. Precise mapping of SVs by OGM at gene-level allowed determining the status of clinically informative biomarkers such as TET2, MECOM, TP53 and KMT2A, without the need for confirmatory assays. Detailed gene-level characterization of different SVs included KMT2A-ELL [t(11;19)] in MDS with WT1 mut , t(9;11) with SYTL2 fusion (and not KMT2A ), der(1;7) leading to del(7q) in MDS with GATA2 mut /IDH2 mut and t(1;3)(p36;q21) rearrangements with potential PRDM16 disruption in SF3B1 mut /RUNX1 mut MDS, among others. Using OGM, we mapped the sequence patterns in both samples with IM with high level of confidence. Additionally, OGM identified 23 cryptic, clinically significant SVs in 14 (18%) of 76 pts. These included deletions of TET2, KMT2A , and del(5q), KMT2A amplification in MDS with FLT3-ITD/ DNMT3A mut / RAS mut , NUP98-PRRX2 , MECOM rearrangement in TET mut mutated NK-MDS. In addition, there were SVs of uncertain significance: duplications of chr1 ( PDE41P ), deletions of chr21 (involving RUNX1) , chr2 ( DNMT3A, ASXL2 ), chr12 ( ETV6 ) and chr22 ( EP300 ) and der(16)t(12;16)(q21.1;q12.1). These cryptic SVs were noted across all R-IPSS risk categories (highest yield in very-low and low R-IPSS) and across all cytogenetic risk-groups (very-good to very-poor). In complex karyotype setting, OGM could resolve the markers and additional genetic material, and in most cases, showed a much higher the degree of complexity within the genome than was apparent by CK. Four pts showed SV patterns typical of chromothripsis/chromoplexy. The median number of mutations per pt was 1 (0-6). When compared to mutation subsets, cryptic SVs were only identified in pts with \u22643 mutations. Majority represented either MDS with TP53 mut (6, 29%) or SF3B1 mut / TET mut (deletions of TET2 , KMT2A , NOTCH1 and EP300 genes). Conclusions Unbiased, high-throughput whole genome SVP revealed cryptic, clinically significant SVs in ~18% of MDS pts. OGM is a single-platform cytogenomic tool that can facilitate SVP at a gene-level resolution. This study provides strong support for further validation in expanded cohorts to guide clinical implementation and integration of SVP for routine work-up.
