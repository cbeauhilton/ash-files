    "abstract_text": "Background . Myelofibrosis in the setting of CML has been historically associated with poor prognosis and with transformation. Its significance in the context of imatinib therapy is unknown. Study Aims . To evaluate the prognostic relevance of myelofibrosis in patients with chronic phase CML post interferon-a failure treated with imatinib. Patients and Methods . 110 patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive CML were analyzed. Imatinib was given at 400 mg orally daily. Marrow biopsies obtained prior to imatinib were subjected to Snook\u2019s reticulin staining and graded on a scale of 1 to 4 for the degree of reticulin fibrosis as previously reported (Dekmezian.Cancer 59:1739, 1987). Severe fibrosis included grades 3\u20134. Results . Patients\u2019 median age was 57 years (24 to 81). Median duration of chronic phase was 31 months (range 6\u2013148). Reticulin fibrosis was grade 1 in 4%, grade 2 in 35%, grade 3 in 28% and grade 4 in 33%. Splenomegaly was more frequent with grade 3\u20134 fibrosis (p=0.04). However, patients with severe fibrosis had a similar incidence of complete cytogenetic response and survival as those with lesser degrees of fibrosis.  Parameter .

Imatinib, being a highly effective therapy in CML, may have reduced or eliminated the previously known prognostic impact of myelofibrosis in CML.",
