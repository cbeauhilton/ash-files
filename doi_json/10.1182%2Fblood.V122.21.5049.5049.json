    "abstract_text": "Introduction In 1998, Hasenclever et al published the International Prognostic Factor for patients with advanced stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Since then, the IPS has been considered the most important prognostic score for cHL and has been validated in different populations, and also in early stage cHL. From the seven factors analyzed in the IPS, albumin is the only that can be influenced by environmental, economic and nutritional status. We hypothesized if, in developing countries, albumin should still be a prognostic factor, and if so, what is the ideal cutoff value. Objectives To assess if albumin at diagnosis of cHL patients in Brazil was prognostic for overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) and what would be the best cutoff. Patient and Methods This is a retrospective multicenter study conducted by the Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Only confirmed cases of cHL, diagnosed between April 1996 To January 2013, with clinical, epidemiological and laboratorial parameters available after a thorough chart review were included in this study. Response was defined as complete (CR) or less than CR (partial response or refractory disease). Event was defined as treatment related mortality, progression (defined as time for initiation of salvage therapy) or relapse. Advanced stage disease was defined as stage I or II with B symptoms and/or bulky disease and stage III or IV. Patients with conflicted data or loss of follow up were excluded from the analysis. Results A total of 179 patients were selected for this study. Nodular sclerosis subtype was diagnosed in 125 (68.9%) of all patients. Median age at diagnosis was 28 years old (ranging from 13-76). Only 22.9% of patients presented with early stage disease. ABVD chemotherapy protocol was the initial therapy in 91% of patients. Consolidation radiotherapy was done in 48.6%. Median serum albumin was 3.74 (range: 1.34 \u2013 5.52). Median albumin for patients treated in private hospital was 3.6 (range: 2.7 \u2013 4.7) in contrast to patients treated in public hospitals with a median level of 3.0 (range: 1.34 \u2013 5.52), although this difference was not statistically different. Overall responses were: CR in 90%, Partial response/Refractory disease in 10%; one patient died due to treatment-related toxicity. Overall Survival (OS) for the entire group was 93% in 5 years (CI95% 87-96%), with a progression free survival (PFS) of 79% (CI95% 73-86%). When applying the cutoff of 4g/dL, albumin was not related to OS (91% vs 98%, p=ns) or PFS (85 vs 77%, p=ns). However, an albumin value greater than 2g/dL was related to a better OS (94% vs 71%, p=0.01). Conclusions Prognostic factors may differ from different studied populations. This is particularly truth for albumin, which is the only IPS factor influenced by the environment. In our study, however, albumin was not significantly related to OS or PFS, unless when a cutoff of 2g/dL was used. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
