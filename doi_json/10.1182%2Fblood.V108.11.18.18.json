    "abstract_text": "Treatment strategies for younger patients (2.667 (poor risk) which gave excellent discrimination for survival from CR at 5 years of 63%, 47% and 24% (p<0.00001). The score was prospectively validated in 897 patients who entered the MRC AML15 trial and was confirmed to be predictive with survivals from CR of 69%, 61% and 42% (p<0.00001). The value of the new score was to move patients out of the old cytogenetic category. The major effect was to move 274 patients from intermediate risk to poor risk and 42 poor risk patients to intermediate risk (table). This score has implications for treatment approach since, relatively, 60% more patients were identified as high risk and are therefore candidates for experimental therapy, or may, from Mantel-Byar analysis, benefit from transplantation.  . .
