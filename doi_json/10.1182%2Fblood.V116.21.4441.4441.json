    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4441 Introduction: When the cell surface marker CD34 became available for enumerating HPC there was controversy as to whether it was useful for predicting time to engraftment after autologous peripheral blood HPC transplant (autoHPCT). It was demonstrated that a threshold dose of 2.0\u20132.5 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg in the product, measured before cryopreservation, predicted reliable engraftment within a reasonable period of time. CD34 is expressed on the surface of HPC ranging from primitive to committed progenitor cells. ALDH is highly expressed in primitive cells such as HPC, endothelial progenitor cells and mesenchymal stromal cells. ALDH br cells are by definition viable, while measurement of viable CD34+ cells requires an additional assay. We tested the correlation of CD34 and ALDH activity in fresh HPC products and then examined the usefulness of these two assays for predicting time to WBC and platelet engraftment after autoHPCT. Materials and Methods: We identified 42 consecutive HPC apheresis products used for autoHPCT for which data on CD34+ numbers and viability as well as ALDHbr cell numbers were available. Data from 5 of these product were not used for predicting engraftment due to lack of engraftment data. Viability was assesed by flow cytometry on pre-cryopreservation (fresh) and post-thaw samples by looking at propidium iodide or 7-AAD uptake within the CD34+ population identified using the ISHAGE method. ALDH activity was measured by flow cytometry on pre-freeze samples using the manufacturers prescribed method. HPC were cryopreserved using a controlled rate freezer and 10% DMSO, then stored in liquid nitrogen. Data on time to WBC and platelet engraftment were determined by chart review. The patents received a median of 3.78 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg (range 2.43\u20138.59 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg) for autoHPCT. Regression analyses were performed to see if viable CD34 in the fresh product, and in the thawed product, correlated with ALDH and whether any of these measures correlate with time to WBC (ANC >500/mm 3 ) or platelet engraftment (>20,000/mm 3 ). Results: The correlation coefficients for ALDHbr vs viable CD34+ cells pre-cryopreservation (r=0.97; n=42) and for ALDHbr cells vs post-thaw CD34+ cells (r=0.96; n=42) were both significant. The percent of variation for ALDHbr cells to WBC engraftment (r 2 = 2.2%; n=37) and for CD34+ cells both pre-freezing and post-thaw to WBC engraftment (r 2 =1.9%; n=37) were not significant. The r 2 for ALDHbr cells and platelet engraftment was 0.9%, the r 2 for CD34+ cells and platelet engraftment was 1.1% pre-freeze (n=37) and was 0.9% post-thaw (n=37) were also not significant. Conclusion: Enumeration of HPC by ALDH correlates well with CD34, suggesting that the two assays are equivalent when analyzing autologous peripheral blood. Neither the number of ALDHbr cells or CD34+ cells in fresh products, nor the number of viable CD34+ cells in the thawed products, correlates with time to WBC and platelet engraftment. Since our patients received at least 2.4 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg, our observations support previous data showing no correlation between cell dose and time to engraftment if more than the HPC threshold dose for engraftment is given for transplant.
