    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3488 Ph + leukemia is effectively treated with BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors such as imatinib (IM). However, recent studies suggest that IM therapy does not eradicate Ph + leukemia stem cells (LSCs). In order to examine the mechanisms of Ph + LSC resistance to IM and seek strategies to overcome this, Ph + ALL patient cells were serially xenotransplanted into immunodeficient NOD/SCID/IL2r\u03b3 null (NOG) mice and abundant spleen cells derived from leukemic NOG mice were co-cultured with S17-stromal cells using methods previously reported (Minami et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 2008). Slow-cycling (Hoechst-33342 low /Pyronin-Y low ) CD34 + cells were insensitive to IM despite complete dephosphorylations of BCR-ABL and its substrate CrkL, which indicated that addiction of BCR-ABL activity is lower for survival in such quiescent cells. From comprehensive drug screening of other small compounds using this co-culturing system, we found that inhibitors of PI3K/AKT/mTOR-axis signaling, including rapamycin, were promising candidates. Aberrant activation of mTOR signaling has also been reported to be involved in some systems of leukemia initiating cells. In vitro , combination treatment with IM and rapamycin analogue, everolimus (RAD001), induced substantial cell death in the slow-cycling CD34 + population with p70-S6K dephosphorylation and decreased expression of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein, MCL-1. In the leukemic NOD/SCID mouse ALL model, in vivo RAD001-treatment showed a decrease of tumor burden including slow-cycling CD34 + cells. However, during the cell death by RAD001-treatment, however, negative feedback-loop effects were detected such as reversely increased phosphorylations of AKT (Ser473) and FOXO1/3a. In vitro , the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, NVP-BEZ235 (BEZ), induced substantial cell death including slow-cycling CD34 + cells at lower doses than those required by RAD001. In biomarker analyses, BEZ-treatment inhibited not only p70-S6K phosphorylation but also phosphorylations of mTOR (Ser2481) itself, 4E-BP1, AKT (Ser473) and FOXO1/3a. At the same time, expression of MCL-1 decreased during the cell death by BEZ-treatment. In T315I-mutated BCR-ABL dependent cell lines such as murine Baf3/p210-T315I and human-derived TCC-Y/T315I, treatment with BEZ induced growth inhibition and cell death. The effects of BEZ on normal stem cells and in mouse Ph + leukemia models are under investigation. These results suggest that treatment with BEZ might have potential for overcoming the resistance to IM due to quiescent property in Ph + LSCs or T315I-mutation.
