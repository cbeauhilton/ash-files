    "abstract_text": "Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is a form of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) that has long been considered a good candidate for gene therapy (GTx). In 2001\u20132002, we treated 4 ADA-SCID patients in a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of 2 different retroviral vectors while continuing enzyme replacement with pegylated bovine ADA (PEG-ADA). No chemotherapy was used. All patients have been monitored for 6 years. No treatment-related serious adverse events occurred. A mild transient elevation in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was seen in 2 patients early post-treatment, however, no durable immunologic changes were observed. Low levels (0.1\u20130.7%) of vector-marked peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) persist in 2 patients treated at the age of 4\u20135 years. All patients remain on PEG-ADA, prophylactic antibiotics and intravenous immunoglobulins. In 2004, we revised the protocol in order to facilitate engraftment and selective advantage of gene-corrected cells by withdrawing PEG-ADA and giving busulfan (75 mg/m^2) before GTx. In November 2005, a first patient was treated who developed unexpected prolonged bone marrow (BM) aplasia. Cytogenetics revealed trisomy 8 aberrations that were found to be present on a BM specimen obtained pre-GTx ( Blood  2007 ; 109 : 503 ). Our second patient enrolled in January 2007. He received 5x10^6 CD34+ cells/kg that showed 40\u2013200 units (U) of ADA activity (normal range 58\u2013128). Over 6 months, this patient showed a slow increase in ALC (up to 750/mcL) and lymphocyte function. PBMC ADA activity has been up to 50U. The deoxyadenosine metabolite (dAXP) level has decreased to 500/mcL were 36 and 45 days, respectively. In >200 combined days of observation, there has been only one temperature above 38 \u00b0C, which resolved with acetaminophen. These data are consistent with the positive results of GTx for ADA-SCID obtained in Milan and London and show that PEG-ADA withdrawal and reduced conditioning improve the outcome of GTx for this disease. Longer follow-up should allow us to study engraftment of cells containing vector-specific sequences and conclude if either vector contributes more to recovery of lymphoid immunity."
