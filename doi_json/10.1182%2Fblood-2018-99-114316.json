    "abstract_text": "Background: The interaction of multiple myeloma (MM) cells with macrophages (M\u03a6s) in the bone marrow microenvironment contributes to the pathophysiology of MM. In addition to promoting angiogenesis through vasculogenic mimicry, MM-associated M\u03a6s (mM\u03a6s) protect MM cells from spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. mM\u03a6s therefore represent a potential target for myeloma treatment and it is essential to explore the mechanisms underlying normal M\u03a6 polarization to mM\u03a6s. We previously showed that IL-32 is overexpressed in MM patients and is mainly derived from MM cells. The present study was designed to explore the clinical significance of IL-32 in MM and to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the IL-32-mediated immune function of M\u03a6s. Methods: We examined the expression of IL-32 in bone marrow biopsy samples using immunohistochemistry. Quantitative real-time PCR, western blot analysis and immunofluorescence were applied to measure the expression of IL-32, IDO and proteinase 3 (PR3). We obtained the global transcriptional profile of the IL-32\u03b3-treated M\u03a6s by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Immunoprecipitation (IP) and GST pulldown experiments was applied to confirm the binding affinity of PR3 for IL-32. We created IL-32-knockdown MM cells by transfection of IL-32 shRNA and silenced PR3 expression in M\u03a6s using siRNA targeting PR3. CD4 + T cell proliferation and IL-2, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 production were measured by flow cytometry. Results: We found that high IL-32 expression in MM patients was associated with advanced clinical stage and high serum \u03b22-microglobulin levels. Several isoforms of IL-32 were detected in MM cells and IL-32\u03b3 was the most active subtype. RNA sequencing revealed that IL-32\u03b3 significantly induced the production of the immunosuppressive molecule indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in M\u03a6s and this effect was verified at the protein level. Furthermore, IL-32-knockdown MM cells showed less ability than control MM cells to promote IDO expression. As a binding protein for IL-32, PR3 was universally expressed on the surface of M\u03a6s and knockdown of PR3 or inhibition of the STAT3 and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathways hindered the IL-32\u03b3-mediated stimulation of IDO expression. Finally, IDO-positive IL-32\u03b3-educated M\u03a6s inhibited CD4 + T cell proliferation and IL-2, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 production in response to activation. Conclusion: Our study showed that MM cell-derived IL-32\u03b3 induced IDO production in M\u03a6s through PR3 and the downstream STAT3 and NF-\u03baB pathways, resulting in the suppression of the proliferation and effector function of CD4 + T cells. High IL-32 expression in MM may contribute to an immunosuppressive microenvironment by upregulating IDO production in M\u03a6s and promote MM progression.
