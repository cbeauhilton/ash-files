    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2072 Introduction: Many randomized control trials demonstrated that HDT-ASCT is superior to conventional therapies in myeloma patients and prolongs progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (Attal M, 1996, Childs JA, 2003). However, in treating a malignancy with a median age of diagnosis of 69 years, the majority of the patients will not be eligible for this beneficial approach if a nominal numerical age cut-off (<65 years) is followed based on the assumption that elderly patients cannot tolerate HDT-ASCT; nor will they be eligible for clinical trials involving HDT-ASCT if stringent age-restricted inclusion criteria are incorporated. Therefore, we have evaluated if the elderly patients benefit from HDT-ASCT. Methods: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 registry data ( www.seer.cancer.gov ) as our comparator (reflects 28% of the US population);to provide information on incidence, prevalence and survival from 1973\u20132009. The data from an institutional cohort (IC) is obtained from the records of patients that underwent HDT-ASCT from January 2000 to January 2012. We used IBM SPSS version 20 to generate the Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Results: Of the 6,571,117 malignant cases listed in SEER registry, a total of 74,826 cases (1.1%) of multiple myeloma (ICD-03 code 9732) were identified (39735 males and 35091 females). Median age of the patients is 70 years. Among these patients 48,988 patients (65%) are over the age of 65. A total of 901 myeloma patients underwent HDT-ASCT from IC during the evaluable period and 167 patients (19%) were over the age of 65. The median survival for each subset is listed in Table 1 . Both male and female WCI-ASCT myeloma patientshad prolonged OS compared to the SEER myeloma patients, despite the difference in magnitude of advantage in IC-ASCT male patients vs. female patients. Both white and black patients, as well as patients undergoing HDT-ASCT across all age subgroups had a significant survival advantage. Conclusions: In each subgroup, by the decade of diagnosis, gender, race, age subsets we have consistently demonstrated a significant survival benefit for IC transplant patients \u2265age 65 compared to SEER myeloma patients \u2265age 65 if offered HDT-ASCT. Selection-bias prevails in the groups showing improved overall survival. Hence, a careful selection process considering physiologic age as a determinant for transplant eligibility would result in better outcomes, and not preclude the elderly from the survival benefits of HDT-ASCT.
