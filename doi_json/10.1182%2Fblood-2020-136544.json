    "abstract_text": "Background . R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) is currently considered as the standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, three-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates remain at 60% and 70%, respectively. We recently reported a new tool to help the early identification of ultra-high risk DLBCL patients 1 . This tool was identified in a cohort of 301 patients included in the REMARC study, responders to R-CHOP, and was based on a combination of 2 factors at baseline: 1/ total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) above 220cm 3 measured on baseline 18FDG-PET and 2/ elevated ECOG PS \u22652. Here, we validated this combination in multiple cohorts including two large clinical trials and in real world. Methods: We evaluated the combination TMTV-PS in a series of 2306 patients with DLBCL including patients treated in clinical trials in Europe and the United States; PETAL (n= 510) and GOYA (n=1315) and 481 patients treated in Real world (RW) across multiple centers in Europe (France, Poland, Portugal, UK). All patients were treated with a combination of immuno-chemotherapy with curative intent (Rituximab (R) or Obinutuzumab (0)-CHOP (R-CHOP n= 70%%, O-CHOP n= 29 %, and intensified regimen n=1%). Patients in PETAL were treated by a PET-guided strategy. Associations of TMTV and ECOG PS at baseline were explored with the International Prognostic Index (IPI) and outcome. Results . For the PETAL, GOYA, and RW series, the median age was 62 (18-80), 62 (18-86), and 65 (17-92), and 55%, 58%, 60%, were > 60y respectively. ECOG PS>2 was present in 11%, 12%, 23% of the patients; IPI 3-5 in 38%, 44%, 51%; TMTV>220 in 45%, 61%, 44%, respectively. The combination of TMTV>220cm 3 and ECOG PS>2 defined in PETAL, GOYA, and RW, patients with no risk factor representing 53%, 37% and 49% of the patients, one risk factor (either TMTV> 220cm 3 or ECOG PS>2) representing 38%, 53.5%, 35% of the patients, and two risk factors representing 9%, 10%, and 16%, respectively. Patients with 2 risk factors had a significantly worse PFS than patients with 0 or 1 risk factor in the PETAL, GOYA and RW series, HR=3.32 (95% CL: 2.0-5.5); HR=2.68 (95% CL: 2.0-3.6), HR=4.06 (95% CL : 2.7-6.1), respectively. Overall survival was also significantly worse in patients with 2 risk factors than patients with 0 or 1 risk factor, HR=3.85 (95% CL: 2.2-6.8); HR=3.16 (95% CL: 2.2-4.5), HR=5.23 (95% CL: 3.4-8.1), respectively. The combination of TMTV-PS performed better than IPI with a positive C-Index for PFS and OS across all the series, PETAL, GOYA, and RW (figure 1) Conclusion . The combination of TMTV and ECOG PS improves risk stratification for patients with DLBCL treated in frontline by standard treatment or intensified immuno-chemotherapy. This observation meets an unmet need for early and better identification of ultra-high risk DLBCL patients.
