    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5035 Background: The incidence of multiple myeloma (MM) is known to be variable according to ethnicity. However the difference of clinical characteristics between ethnic groups is not well-defined. In Asian countries the incidence of MM has been lower compared with Western countries. However, there are growing evidences that MM is increasing very rapidly in this region. Until now, only few data of Asian patients has been reported. Asian myeloma network (AMN) decided to analyze the first multinational project to explore clinical characteristics of Asian MM patients and clinical practice performed in Asian countries. Methods: Data were collected from 22 centers from 7 countries and regions were collected retrospectively. Clinical characteristics of 3377 symptomatic MM patients at diagnosis were described. Overall survival (OS) and prognostic factors were analyzed for 3324 patients who have survival data. Results: Clinical and genetic characteristics were summarized at table 1 . Median OS was 47 months (95% CI 48. 0\u201360. 0). Patients who were diagnosed before 2000 were shorter survival. Transplantation was performed to 607 patients with better survival (84 vs 40 months, p<0. 001). First line treatment of 2906 evaluable patients was analyzed. Overall response rate was 71% including VGPR or better 31%. Novel drug-based regimens including bortezomib, thalidomide or lenalidomide were used for 32. 5% of all 2906 patients without difference in response rate or OS. Conclusions: We successfully described clinical characteristics of Asian MM patients and this project will be the base for future studies or clinical trials for Asian MM patients. Updated analyses and comparison with Western data will be presented. AMN, supported by the International Myeloma Foundation (IMF) IMWG initiative. Table 1.
