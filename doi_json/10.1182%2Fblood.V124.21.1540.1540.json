    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are indicated for the prevention of systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation and for the prevention and treatment of venous thrombosis. Although DOACs offer advantages over the vitamin K antagonists, some hesitancy remains over their use given the lack of specific antidotes for management of life threatening bleeding events. In vivo studies, case reports and case series have shown that prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and activated PCC might potentially be used to control life threatening bleeding in patients with DOAC-associated bleeding episodes. Herein we describe management and outcomes of DOAC-associated life threatening bleeding events using an activated PCC (FEIBA\u2122). Methods: A retrospective review of patients presenting with DOAC-associated (dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban) life threatening bleeding to The Ottawa Hospital between January 2013 and June 2014 are included. Patients received 25 \u2013 50 units/kg of FEIBA\u2122. The primary outcome was adverse thrombotic and embolic events during follow-up. Secondary outcome was symptomatic control of bleeding. Results: Nine patients presented to hospital with life threatening bleeding episodes (post trauma: n=3; spontaneous bleeding: n=6). Spontaneous episodes included epistaxis or gastro-intestinal bleeding. Baseline characteristics are depicted in Table 1. A majority of patients had atrial fibrillation (n=8) and received rivaroxaban (n=5). The last dose of DOAC was taken within 24 hours of bleeding events for all patients. All patients received supportive management, interventions/procedures aimed at attaining source control of bleeding when possible, and transfusion of FEIBA\u2122 for reversal of anticoagulant effect. Adverse events after receiving FEIBA\u2122 were uncommon with one patient experiencing a TIA with expressive aphasia and visual field deficit on the evening of FEIBA\u2122 transfusion; deficits resolved by the time of hospital discharge. Two patients with GI bleeding continued to have ongoing bleeding despite FEIBA\u2122 administration and two patients died as a result of major bleeding. Conclusions: In this cohort of patients with major bleeding associated with DOACs, FEIBA\u2122 administration, in addition to supportive care, was helpful in minimizing further complications of most bleeding events and associated with a low rate of adverse events. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate benefits and harms of FEIBA\u2122 for management of DOAC associated major bleeding. Abstract 1540.
