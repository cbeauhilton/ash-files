    "abstract_text": "Abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 6 are a common feature in various B-cell malignancies. However, in most cases the involved genes have not yet clearly been identified. We have molecularly characterized the recently established cell line BLUE - 1 that has been derived from a relapsed sporadic Burkitt lymphoma. This cell lines carries a t(6;20)(q15;q11.2) rearrangement in addition to the typical t(8;14) with MYC - IgH fusion. The involved gene loci on chromosomes 6 and 20 were up to now unknown. To identify the involved gene loci on both chromosomes we applied a sequential BAC clone mapping strategy. BAC RP11-243J16 clone (20q11.21, bp 29,756,679\u201329,925,538) was found to hybridize with der(6) as well as der(20). BAC RP1-104D1 (6q15, bp 91,001,943\u201391,064,406) also covered the breakpoint region. Two of the involved genes in this region are the transcription factor BACH2 ( basic leucine zipper transcription factor 2 ) on 6q15 and BCL2L1 ( BCL - X ) on 20q11, a member of the BCL2 anti-apoptosis gene family. We hypothesized that these two genes could be involved and by testing different primer combinations were able to amplify a BACH2 - BCL2 fusion mRNA transcript using RT-PCR. In this fusion transcript the first (non-coding) exon of BACH2 was fused to the second (partially coding) exon of BCL2L1 thus effectively placing the BCL2L1 gene under the control of the BACH2 promotor. Western blot analysis showed a strong expression of BCL2L1 . This is the first report of a fusion gene involving the genes BACH2 and BCL2L1 . The prototype of the BCL2 family, BCL - 2 on 18q21.3 is known to play a crucial role in various lymphomas but a clear role for the closely related BCL2L1 gene in lymphomas has not yet been established. BACH2 is known to be expressed in B-cells at various maturation stages and is believed to be involved in the machinery of class switch recombination (CSR). Bach2 \u2212/\u2212 mice show increased IgM but decreased IgG and IgA levels and a deficient T cell-independent and T cell-dependent IgG response associated with defective CSR. In summary, this molecularly characterized translocation provides a new tool for studying recurrent 6q aberrations in lymphomas and for the action of the BCL2L1 antiapoptosis gene."
