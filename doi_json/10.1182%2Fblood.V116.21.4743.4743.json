    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4743 We evaluated a novel e-notebook -based education program for patients with multiple myeloma. The program was developed by the Myeloma Initiative in the Veteran's Administration (MIVA) consortium to educate patients while they wait for clinic appointments or procedures. The goals of this study were to assess feasibility of the program in a busy clinic setting, patients\u2019 gain in knowledge from the program, patients\u2019 acceptance of the e-notebook format, and potential use of program in other populations and in different formats. Study subjects were patients with multiple myeloma being treated at the Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System McClellan Hospital. Eligibility criteria were diagnosis of multiple myeloma, ability to follow instructions in the program and complete a paper questionnaire. Study subjects underwent the program while awaiting their oncology visit and then completed a survey consisting of ten multiple-choice questions designed to measure the goals of the study. The scope of the questions were: patients\u2019 perceived benefit of the education program in improving their understanding of their disease (three questions), patients\u2019 primary source of medical education, patients\u2019 preferences in regard to educational formats (three questions), and multiple myeloma knowledge (three questions). Program use did not adversely affect patient flow in our busy oncology clinic, and was well accepted by the patients. Eight patients were enrolled in the study. All patients considered their oncologist to be their primary source of information about their disease. All patients stated that the education program helped them better understand the information provided by their oncologists and better understand multiple myeloma treatment options. Five patients (63%) answered that the program motivated them to learn more about myeloma. Seven patients (88%) recommended that this program be expanded to spouses or family members, and seven patients (88%) advocated creating a video format of the program for repeat viewing. Five patients (63%) stated they plan to view the content again at a later time. Of all multiple myeloma knowledge questions, 71% were answered correctly and 50% of the patients attributed their correct answers to information they learned in the education program. We conclude that this e-notebook -based multiple myeloma education program is well accepted, can be adopted in a busy clinic and has the potential for further applications. It is an effective and motivating tool for patient education in adjunct with physician efforts. It can be a productive utilization of waiting room time.
