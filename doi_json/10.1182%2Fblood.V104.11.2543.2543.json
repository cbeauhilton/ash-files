    "abstract_text": "Ritonavir (RTV) is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome p450 (CYPs) enzymes. This study explores the effects of RTV on CYP24 which converts 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [1,25(OH) 2 D 3 ] to its inactive form 1,24,25,(OH) 3 . Real-time RT-PCR showed that exposure of HL-60 cells to 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 (10 \u22127 M, 1h) induced expression of CYP24 by 80-fold, and pre-incubation of these cells with RTV (2X10 \u22125 M, 3h) decreased 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 -stumulated expression of CYP24 transcripts by 30 %, resulting in increased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 in culture media (50.7 vs 82.4 nmol/L). Importantly, pre-incubation of HL-60 cells with RTV (2X10 \u22125 M, 3h) and then exposure to 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 (10 \u22127 M, 24 h) also increased intracellular levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 (1.20 vs 2.46 nmol/L) and potentiated the ability of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 to induce growth arrest of HL-60 cells. Clonogenic assay showed that either RTV (5X10 \u22126 M) or 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 (10 \u22128 M) alone inhibited colonal growth of HL-60 cells by either a mean 30 \u00b1 12 (\u00b1SD) % and 40 \u00b1 12 %, respectively; when both were combined, colony formation was inhibited by a mean 80 \u00b1 13 % ( p <0.01). Measurement of CD14 expression, NBT reduction, and non-specific esterase staining showed that RTV augmented the prodifferentiative effects of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 in HL-60 cell. For example, 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 (10 \u22128 M, 2 days) induced approximately 48 % of HL-60 cells to become CD14 antigen positive. RTV (2X10 \u22125 M, 48h) alone did not stimulate expression of CD14 antigen; when 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 was combined with RTV, approximately 65 % of cells expressed CD14. Furthermore, androgen-independent DU145 human prostate cancer cells, that are resistant to growth inhibition by 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 , expressed 80-fold higher levels of CYP24 transcripts compared to HL-60 cells, and intracellular levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 were not detectable (<0.3 nmol/L) after exposure of these cells to 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 (10 \u22127 M, 24 h). Of note, pre-incubation of these cells with RTV (2X10 \u22125 M, 3h) and then exposure to 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 (10 \u22127 M, 24 h) increased intracellular levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 0.94 nmol/L and sensitized DU145 cells to growth inhibition mediated by 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 as measured by MTT assay. Taken together, inhibition of CYP24 might open a new paradigm for therapy using vitamin D compounds."
