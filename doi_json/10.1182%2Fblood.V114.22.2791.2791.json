    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2791 Poster Board II-767 Gene silencing by promoter methylation is as potent as functional inactivating of tumor suppressor genes by mutations. DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-azacytidine (AC) and 5-aza-2 -deoxycitidine (DAC), which is proved to be effective in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) can induce re-expression in cancer; however their mechanism remains controversial. 25 tumor suppressor genes by MS-MLPA (methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification) were analyzed in 44 MDS patients treated Vidaza\u00ae (5-azacitidine, AC). Hypermethylation of at least one gene was detected in 9/44 patients (20.5%), including four genes CDKN2B, FHIT, ESR1 and IGSF4. Interestingly, of 9 hypermethylated patients, 8 patients showed demethylation in concordance with their clinical responses after three to five cycles AC treatment. Lack or decrease methylation was observed in four patients with hematological improvements. Persistence methylation was observed in four others who became AML transformation or no response after treatment, especially reinforcing methylated gene in a case progressed to leukemia later. Our study also founds out IGSF4 gene hypermethylation in MDS as a first report. Additionally, mRNA expression of CDKN2B, IGSF4, and ESR1 in MDS were significantly lower than those in the control group ( p < 0.05). Our results suggest that the methylation changes of specific genes contributes to disease pathogenesis and might present a molecular marker that can be used to monitor the efficacy of AC treatment in MDS.
