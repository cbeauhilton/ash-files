    "abstract_text": "Factor VIII (FVIII) with a multi-domain structure (A1-a1-A2-a2-B-a3-A3-C1-C2) is a procofactor and precursor for the anti-hemophilic cofactor protein, FVIIIa. Following the intracellular processing within the B domain, secreted FVIII circulates as a heterodimer with variably sized (90K-200K) heavy chain (A1-a1-A2-a2-B) and an 80K light chain (a3-A3-C1-C2). Proteolytic activation of FVIII by thrombin that yields heterotrimeric FVIIIa (A1-a1/A2-a2/A3-C1-C2), the cofactor for intrinsic tenase, involves cleavage of three peptide bonds between Arg 372 -Ser 373 , Arg 740 -Ser 741 , and Arg 1689 -Ser 1690 . Cleavage at Arg 740 removes the B-domain, and cleavage at Arg 1689 removes the a3-acidic region and releases FVIII from vWF, its carrier protein, and exposes membrane binding sites within the FVIII light chain. Cleavage at Arg 372 separates A1-a1 and A2-a2 domains and is implicated in the cofactor-dependent recognition and enhancement in the rate of factor X (FX) activation by intrinsic tenase. Subsequently, the separated A2-a2 domain dissociates spontaneously from the heterotrimeric FVIIIa resulting in the rapid loss of cofactor activity. We speculated that the requirement for cleavage at Arg 372 might be obviated by the insertion of an optimized linker sequence between A1-a1 and A2-a2 domains on an uncleavable Gln 372 backbone. To investigate this possibility, we prepared cDNA constructs of B-domain deleted FVIII variants; FVIII wild-type (FVIII WT ), FVIII 372Q , and FVIII 372Q followed by a rigid (Ala-Pro) 5 linker sequence (FVIII 372Q -AP 5 ). All three FVIII constructs were stably transfected into BHK cells and high expressing clones were selected by one stage aPTT and western blotting of expression media. Selected stable clones were further expanded to collect 15L of expression media over 5-day period, and recombinant FVIII variants were purified using a three-step chromatographic approach. These FVIII variants were studied using SDS-PAGE, western blotting, aPTT assays, thrombin generation assay (TGA) and purified assays to assess kinetics of FX activation and spontaneous loss of cofactor activity. In contrast to FVIII WT , FVIII 372Q and FVIII 372Q -AP 5 were completely resistant to cleavage at Gln 372 by thrombin, yielding bands corresponding to A1-a1-A2-a2 (90K) and A3-C1-C2 (73K). In one stage aPTT assays, FVIII 372Q showed prolonged clotting times with specific activity in the range of 200-400 U/mg, while FVIII WT and FVIII 372Q -AP 5 displayed comparable clotting times with specific activities ranging between 8000-10000 U/mg and 4500-5500 U/mg, respectively. In TGA initiated with either 0.1 pM tissue factor or 1 pM factor XIa, both FVIII WT and FVIII 372Q -AP 5 displayed similar TGA profiles. In steady state kinetic studies of FX activation using limiting concentrations of factor IXa, saturating concentrations of FVIII variants pretreated with thrombin, membranes and increasing concentrations of FX, the cofactor function of thrombin-cleaved FVIII 372Q was severely impaired. However, despite lack of cleavage at Gln 372 in FVIII 372Q -AP 5 , catalytic efficiency for FX activation by intrinsic tenase assembled by this variant was comparable to that seen with FVIIIa WT . At the physiological concentration of FX, the initial velocity for Xa formation (v/E) for intrinsic tenase assembled with FVIIIa 372Q -AP 5 was within a factor of 2 of that observed with FVIIIa WT while the rate observed with FVIIIa 372Q was >10-fold lower. Following rapid activation with thrombin, loss of cofactor function was significantly slower for FVIIIa 372Q -AP 5 (t 1/2 ~ 10 min) compared to FVIIIa WT (t 1/2 ~ 2 min). Our findings indicate that the requirement for cleavage at Arg 372 for the development of full FVIIIa cofactor function can be overcome by modulating the A1-A2 connector with an optimized linker sequence. Failure to yield an infinitely stable cofactor in the case of FVIIIa 372Q -AP 5 suggests that cleavage at Arg 372 does not solely explain the spontaneous loss of FVIIIa cofactor function.
