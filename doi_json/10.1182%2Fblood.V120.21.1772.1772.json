    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1772 CD49d (\u03b14 integrin chain) is a strong negative prognosticator in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with a key role in CLL cell microenvironmental interactions. CD49d triggering by its main ligands Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and non-RGD sites (CS-1 fragments) of fibronectin (FN) activates signalling pathways delivering pro-survival signals, and promoting resistance to drug-induced apoptosis in CLL. Recently, the globular (g) C1q-like domain of Elastin MIcrofibriL INterfacer1 (EMILIN1), an adhesive extracellular matrix constituent, was described as a new ligand for CD49d, where it operates as a negative modulator of proliferation signals in substrate-adherent non-hematopoietic CD49d+ cells (Danussi et al, J Cell Biol, 2011). Here, we investigated the distribution of EMILIN1 in normal and CLL-involved tissues, and the effects of EMILIN1/CD49d interaction in CLL in terms of adhesion and survival. By taking advantage of a specific anti-human EMILIN1 monoclonal antibody (Spessotto et al, J Biol Chem, 2003), exploratory staining in reactive lymphoid tissues (tonsil) indicated a clear extracellular EMILIN1 specific reactivity in the outer zone of the mantle/marginal areas. When investigated in lymph node tissues from CLL cases (n=3) by both immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses, a clear EMILIN1 positive staining was detected intermingled with the neoplastic component. To verify whether EMILIN1 could promote CLL cell adhesion, we took advantage of the CLL-derived CD49d+ Mec-1 CLL-like cell model, previously demonstrated by us to adhere to both VCAM-1 and FN (Zucchetto et al, Leukemia, 2012). Results demonstrated similar adhesion levels of Mec-1 cells on VCAM-1, CS-1 fragment of FN and the gC1q-like EMILIN1 domain (mean number of adherent cells per field 267\u00b124, 272\u00b17 and 317\u00b121, respectively).Consistently, adhesion experiments with primary CLL cells characterized by high and homogeneous CD49d expression confirmed similar levels of adhesion on both VCAM-1 and EMILIN1 (mean number of adherent cells per field 141\u00b155 and 135\u00b176, respectively). In all cases adhesion was specifically blocked by pre-treatment with the anti-CD49d HP1/2 blocking antibody. Immunofluorescence analysis with Mec-1 and primary CLL cells showed the recruitment of phospho-Vav-1 at the CD49d/EMILIN1 adhesion sites, with concomitant F-actin reorganization, confirming the activation of the integrin signalling pathway. The effects of EMILIN1/CD49d interactions in CLL were next investigated performing short-term adhesion experiments (2 and 5 minutes) on gC1q-like EMILIN1 domain and VCAM-1 using CLL cells from three CD49d+ cases, and verifying the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 kinases, key mediators of survival signals by western blotting. In all cases, an increased intensity of Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was documented after two-minutes of adhesion on both EMILIN1 (mean fold increase =1.2\u00b10.1, and =5.0\u00b11.0 as compared to controls, respectively) and VCAM-1 (mean fold increase =1.6\u00b10.2, and =4.0\u00b11.9, respectively). The phosphorylation was even greater after five minutes (mean fold increase =2.4\u00b10.5, and =10.0\u00b14.0, for EMILIN1 and =2.4\u00b10.6 and =5.0\u00b10.7 for VCAM-1, respectively). The concomitant increase of phospho-Vav-1 confirmed the activation of the integrin signalling pathway. Finally, we verified whether CD49d/EMILIN1 interaction was able to protect CLL cells from spontaneous apoptosis, by culturing purified cells from 6 CLL cases on gC1q-like EMILIN1 domain, VCAM-1, or control substrate (1% BSA), and checking cell viability after 5 days. Both VCAM-1 and EMILIN1 were able to protect CLL cells from spontaneous apoptosis (p=0.03 and p=0.001, respectively), the viability obtained on EMILIN1 being also significantly higher than that observed on VCAM-1 (p=0.007). In conclusion, we showed here for the first time that EMILIN1 is present in normal and CLL-involved lymphoid tissues, and it is able to efficiently bind to CD49d, as expressed by CLL cells. At variance of what demonstrated in non-hematopoietic models, EMILIN1 was shown to be able to deliver anti-apoptotic/pro-survival signals to circulating CLL cells. EMILIN1/CD49d interactions may have a role in the maintenance of the neoplastic clone in CD49d-expressing CLL. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
