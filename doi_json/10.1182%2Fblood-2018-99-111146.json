    "abstract_text": "Background: The cure rate for advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is approximately 70%, which is calculated based on data from clinical trials performed in North American and/or European countries (Canellos GP, et al. N Engl J Med. 1992;327:1478-84; Carde P, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2016;34:2028-36; Gordon LI, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2013;31:684-91). However, there are limited outcome data available in other countries, apart from some small hospital-based studies (Ramirez P, et al. Rev Bras Hematol E Hemoter. 2015;37:184-9; Law MF, et al. Arch Med Sci. 2014;10:498-504; Jaime-P\u00e9rez JC, et al. Oncologist. 2015;20:386-92; Omer Al-Sayes FM, Sawan A. J Taibah Univ Med Sci. 2006;1:48-56). The B-HOLISTIC retrospective chart review study seeks to address the paucity of data on cHL treatment patterns, clinical outcomes, and healthcare resource utilization in 13 countries across Latin America, Africa, Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region. Methods: The study will collect data from approximately 2,600 patients aged \u226518 years and newly diagnosed with stage IIB-IV cHL or relapsed/refractory cHL (RRHL) between 01 January 2010 and 31 December 2013, and will follow them until death or chart review, whichever occurs first. The primary objective is to describe progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with RRHL. Secondary objectives include describing demographic and clinical characteristics, clinical outcomes (overall survival, best clinical response after completion of treatment, response duration), key adverse events associated with each line of therapy, and cHL-related healthcare resource use. Results: As of 14 May 2018, a total of 165 patients from 12 sites have been included in the interim analysis, predominantly from Turkey and South Korea. At this time, 150 patients had cHL and 24 patients had RRHL, including 9 patients who were enrolled in the cHL group and had a documented relapse/progression during the study period. Here, we report the results of the newly diagnosed cHL group; data from the RRHL group will be reported in subsequent publications. At diagnosis, 64.7% of the cHL group were male, with a median age of 36.5 years (range, 18-89 years); 22.7% had stage IV disease, 30% had extranodal disease, 59.3% had 'B' symptoms, and 34.9% had an International Prognostic Score (IPS) of \u22654. Patients were classified as 13.3% in stage I-IIA; 24% in stage IIB; 53.3% in stage IIIA-IVB; and 9.3% as unknown. Patients classified as stage I-IIA are a deviation from the clinical study protocol and will be removed from the final study analysis. The proportion of patients alive was 94%, with the cause of death reported as either HL-related (44.4%), due to an adverse event (11.1%), or other (44.4%). Positron emission tomography (PET) or PET-computed tomography (CT) imaging was performed in 58.5% of patients at baseline, 48% of patients at interim, and 36.6% at end-of-treatment; CT imaging was performed in 68.7% of patients at baseline, 83.6% of patients at interim, and 59.7% of patients at end-of-treatment. At frontline treatment, 95.3% of patients received chemotherapy (mostly doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine [ABVD], 92.3% [median number of cycles, 6; range, 2-8]), 22.7% of patients received radiotherapy, with 22% of patients receiving radiotherapy and chemotherapy (median total dose, 34.5 Gy; range, 24-45 Gy). The majority of patients received involved-field radiotherapy (53.1%), with other modalities including involved-node (21.9%), involved-site (18.8%), whole body (3.1%), or other (3.1%). The proportion of patients who achieved a complete or partial response to frontline treatment was 52.1% and 21.1%, respectively. The PFS for treatment in frontline cHL in the overall patient population at 48 months was 81% (95% CI, 73.1-86.7; Figure 1), with a median duration of follow-up of 58.9 months (range, 2.6-128.3 months). The PFS for treatment in frontline cHL excluding ineligible patients classified as stage I-IIA (13.3%) at 48 months was 78.9% (95% CI 69.7-85.6). Due to the retrospective nature of this study, adverse events were under-reported and will be presented once the data are mature. Conclusion: The B-HOLISTIC study is ongoing, with final patient enrolment anticipated in December 2018. These interim data provide real-world information on the incidence, treatment, and outcomes of cHL in countries where little is known about this patient population.
