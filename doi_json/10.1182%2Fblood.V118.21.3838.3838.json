    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3838 Background: SAR302503 (SAR503, formerly TG101348), a potent, oral JAK2-selective inhibitor was studied in a Phase I/II trial for the treatment of patients with high- or intermediate-risk primary, post-polycythemia vera (PV) and post-essential thrombocythemia (ET) myelofibrosis (MF). SAR503 was administered orally once daily in 28-day cycles. Eligibility criteria included platelet count of \u226550 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Interim safety and efficacy data from this study up to April 2010 have been previously published ( JCO 2011, 29(7):789\u2013796 ). The aim of this presentation is to report updated safety and efficacy of ongoing patients as well as an analysis of the JAK2V617F allele burden in this cohort. Results: Overall, 59 subjects (median age 64 years) were treated. Forty four patients had PMF, 12 post-PV MF and 3 post-ET MF; 86% were JAK2 V617F-positive. Median palpable spleen size was 18 cm at study enrollment. Twenty eight patients were treated in the dose-escalation cohort (30\u2013800 mg administered as a single daily dose); thirty one patients were treated at the MTD (680 mg) in the dose confirmation cohort. 43/59 patients (73%) completed 6 cycles of treatment and continued treatment on the extension study. Currently, 22 patients (37%) remain on treatment with a median number of 28.5 cycles (24\u201341 range) and a median of last dose of 440 mg/day. Safety: Treatment-emergent toxicities in cycle 1\u20136 have been previously reported; toxicities were dose-dependent and generally alleviated with dose-reduction. Five patients discontinued treatment beyond cycle 6 for treatment-related adverse events: thrombocytopenia, depression, mental status changes, creatinine elevation and subdural hematoma. For the subgroup of patients with a baseline platelet count between 50\u2013100 \u00d7 10 9 /L ( n =13; median 73, range 51\u201394); the platelet count at defined times points during follow up was: cycle 3; median 50, range 21\u2013138 (p=0.09) and cycle 6; median 47, range 13\u201385 (p=0.01). Despite 7 of the 13 patients being treated at \u2265680 mg/day, only 2 instances of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia were noted in this group Spleen response: As previously reported, spleen responses were seen early, usually within first 3 cycles, with half or more patients in each dose level \u2265240 mg/day showing a durable \u226550% decrease in palpable spleen size. Spleen size (mean, median, range, and proportion with \u226550% reduction) at the following time points was: Baseline ( n=58; 18.33cm, 18cm, 4\u201338cm, NA ) ; 6 months ( n=57; 9.05cm, 9cm, 0\u201330cm, 54.4%; ) 12 months ( n=42; 8.55cm, 9cm, 0\u201328cm, 66.7% ) 18 months ( n=36; 8.03cm, 8.5cm, 0\u201333cm, 52.8% ); 24 months ( n=31; 8.10cm, 8cm, 0\u201330cm, 54.8%, ) 30 months ( n=18; 6cm, 7.5cm, 0\u201316cm, 61.1%,and ) 36 months (n=9; 5.89cm, 3cm, 0\u201316cm, 66.7%) . JAK2V617F allele burden: We previously reported a significant decrease in JAK2V617F allele burden at the end of cycles 6 and 12. A durable decrease was also demonstrable after 24 cycles of treatment ( n =21; median 9%, range 0\u2013100%) relative to baseline ( n =51; median 20%, range 3\u2013100%) (p=0.03). Similarly, for patients with JAK2 V617F allele burden >20% at baseline; there was a significant decrease after cycle 24 ( n =12; median 21%, range 6\u2013100%) relative to baseline ( n =23; median 60%, range 23\u2013100%) (p=0.03). Conclusions: SAR503 is safe and efficacious treatment with long term effect on spleen size and JAK2V617F allele burden in patients with high- and intermediate-risk myelofibrosis. Additional follow up information will be updated at the time of meeting.
