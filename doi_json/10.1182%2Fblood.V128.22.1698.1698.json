    "abstract_text": "In recent years expression levels of several genes & microRNAs (miR) were identified as strong prognostic markers, capable to refine AML risk stratification. So far technical difficulties, including the limitations of established methods for comparable, absolute quantification & the lack of defined cut points prevented translation of these findings into clinical practice. Innovative digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) is a novel technique with high sensitivity, specificity that allows absolute quantification - without the need for standard curves - & promises better inter-laboratory comparability. In AML pts, high miR-155 expression levels associate with the presence of FLT3 -ITD & independently predict inferior outcome. Here, for the first time we applied ddPCR for absolute quantification of pre- miR-155 to define an absolute cut point to discriminate between high & lowexpressers, which was then validated in a second set of AML pts. We analyzed a homogeneous test set of 71 AML pts treated between January 2000 & June 2012 in our institution. All pts received cytarabinebased induction therapies & were consolidated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) after non-myeloablativeconditioning (NMA; consisting of fludarabine[30mg / m\u00b2 at days -4 to -2] & 2Gy total body irradiation [day 0]). At NMA-HCT ptswere in first (n=43; 60.6%) or second complete remission (CR; n=16; 22.5%) or CR with incomplete recovery (n=12; 16.9%). At diagnosis, cytogenetics & mutation status of the NPM1 , CEBPA , IDH1 , IDH2 & DNMT3A gene & presence of FLT3 -ITD or FLT3 -TKD mutation were assessed. The expression of the pre- miR-155 stem loop was measured using an EvaGreen-based ddPCR assay & normalized to the absolute copy numbers of ABL1 . The R Package OptimalCutpointswas used to determine a cut point of 1.104 copies pre- miR-155 per 100 ABL1 copies to discriminate between high (n =29; 40.8%) & low (n =42; 59.2 %) miR-155 expressers. High miR-155 expressers, more often had a FLT3 -ITD (p=.039) & less frequently a mutation in the FLT3 -TKD (p=.010). No significant association was found for other clinical or biological markers at diagnosis. In the test set, pts with more than 1.104 copies pre- miR-155 per 100 ABL1 copies at diagnosis had a significant shorter event-free survival (EFS; p=.03, figure 1A) & overall survival (OS; p=.009, figure 1B). To validate these findings, we used a second set of 71 pts (median age 63.4y [range 37.1 to 74.7]) with a median follow-up of 3.7y for pts alive that all received cytarabinebased induction therapies & NMA-HCT as consolidation. The ptsin the validation set also did not differ significantly in the analyzed clinical or molecular characteristics ( i.e. white blood count, hemoglobin, platelets, blasts in bone marrow or peripheral blood at diagnosis, remission status at HCT [CR1 vs. CR2 vs. CRi], ELN genetic group, mutational status of FLT3 -TKD, NPM1 , CEBPA , DNMT3A , IDH1 or IDH2 & presence of FLT3 -ITD). Using the determined cut point of 1.104 copies pre- miR-155 / 100 ABL1 copies in the test set, patients in the validation set were divided in 39 patients (54.9%) with a high miR-155 expression & 32 (45.1%) with a low miR-155 expression. Pts with high miR-155 expression in the validation set had shorter EFS (p=.11, figure 2A) by trend & a significant shorter OS (p=.05, figure 2B). In conclusion, ddPCRis a novel, feasible method that allows absolute quantification of miRexpression. We defined an absolute cut point of 1.104 copies pre- miR-155 per 100 ABL1 copies for the prognosticator miR-155 in AML without the need for standard curves. Pts with pre- miR-155 expression above the cut point had a significant shorter EFS & OS. Remarkably, using a second clinically comparable set, we were able to validate our test set findings. Future studies are planned to confirm the clinical impact of pre- miR-155 expression levels at diagnosis, as well as the identified absolute pre- miR-155 / ABL1 copy number cut point to distinguish high from low miR-155 expressers.
