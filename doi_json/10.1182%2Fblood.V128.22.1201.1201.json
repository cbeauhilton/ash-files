    "abstract_text": "The molecular mechanisms that control leukemic transformation in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia remain unclear. Leukemic stem cells/progenitors (LSC/P) hijack common pathways utilized by hematopoietic stem cells/progenitors (HSC/P) while they also activate other unique pathways that result in increased self-renewal and differentiation arrest susceptible of therapeutic intervention. A major regulator of HSC self-renewal vs differentiation is the distribution of polarized cell fate determinants. Atypical protein kinase C (aPKC)-\u03b6 and aPKCi in humans or its homologue aPKC\u03bb in mice are the catalytic components of the apical polarity complex PAR3-PAR6. aPKCs have also been argued to function as tumor suppressors. We have previously shown that the genetic deficiency of aPKC activity is dispensable for normal HSC/P activity (Sengupta A et al., PNAS 2011). We had found that primary human and murine BCR-ABL + LSC/P have ~2-3 fold increased activation of aPKC\u03bb/i. To investigate the possible role of aPKCs in LSC/P activity, we utilized a lymphoid blast-crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia model and evaluated the role aPKC\u03b6 and aPKC\u03bb inducible deficiency in leukemic progression. After leukemia induction resulting from doxcycycline withdrawal in Scl-tTA/TRE-BCR-ABL mice that were also transgenic for Mx1Cre, aPKC\u03b6 -/- and/or aPKC\u03bb flox/flox , leukemic mice (dox-off) were treated with polyI:C to induce deletion of aPKC\u03bb. aPKC\u03bb \u0394/\u0394 LSC (Lin - cKit + Sca1 + CD135 - CD34 - ) and progenitors (CFU-C) of transplanted recipient mice were 40 and 87% reduced, respectively, suggesting a critical role of aPKC\u03bb in the maintenance of LSC/P. Upon serial transplantation of bone marrow (BM) from CML animals, all WT and aPKC\u03b6 -/- recipient mice died by 6-10 weeks of B-ALL. However, mice transplanted with aPKC\u03bb \u0394/\u0394 or aPKC\u03b6 -/- ;aPKC\u03bb \u0394/\u0394 BM cells did not die after serial transplantation followed for over one year, despite maintaining leukemic B-cells in circulation and hematopoietic tissues with catalytically active BCR-ABL expression. Leukemic ProB/PreB cells deficient in aPKC\u03bb activity showed ~67% reduced proliferation and 2-fold higher apoptosis than WT and aPKC\u03b6 deficient ProB/PreB cells while non-leukemic aPKC\u03bb deficient B-cell lymphopoiesis was grossly normal. Similarly, shRNA-mediated knock-down of aPKCi, in CML patient derived LSC/P led to reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis and enhanced differentiation indicating that aPKCi is also required for the survival and maintenance of human LSC/P. Strikingly, the B-cell differentiation program was restored in aPKC\u03bb \u0394/\u0394 mice with expansion of IgM expressing B cells. Downstream, the activation of CrkL, MEK/ERK and Myc signaling pathways were attenuated in absence of aPKC\u03bb in leukemic B-progenitor cells. Unlike non-leukemic B-cell progenitors, the transcriptome of aPKC\u03bb-deficient leukemic B-progenitors showed up-regulation of the B-lymphoid differentiation gene network ( Pax5 , Ebf1, Ikzf1 , Ikzf2, Ikzf3, Rag1 & Rag2) . Interestingly, Myc protein expression was reduced and the cell fate determinant Numb mislocalized in aPKC\u03bb \u0394/\u0394 leukemic B-cell progenitors, with predominant nuclear distribution. The mRNA/protein expression of Satb2, a chromatin modifier controlling Myc and Numb expression as well as B-cell differentiation, was significantly reduced in aPKC\u03bb-deficient leukemic B-cell progenitors while the expression of its antagonist Satb1 was unchanged. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of leukemic B-cell progenitors showed ~16-200 fold increased enrichment of Satb2 binding to promoter sequences of Cdkn2a and B-cell differentiation genes Pax5 and Ebf1 over non-leukemic B-cell progenitors. Finally, forced expression of Satb2 in aPKC\u03bb \u0394/\u0394 deficient LSC/P rescued leukemic proliferation and B-cell differentiation arrest in vivo indicating that Satb2, downstream of aPKC\u03bb, is required for BCR-ABL + LSC/P activity. Taken together, these data indicate that aPKC\u03bbacts as an oncogene in leukemic B-cell progenitors. Loss of aPKC\u03bb reduces LSC/proB proliferation and survival, and restores B-cell differentiation through combined reduction of MAPK activation, Numb mislocalization and differential expression/activity of the chromatin modifier Satb2. This data defines the role of aPKC\u03bb in LSC/P activity and identifies aPKC\u03bb as a new target for pharmacological intervention dispensable for normal lympho-hematopoiesis.
