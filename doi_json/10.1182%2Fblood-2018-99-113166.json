    "abstract_text": "Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) remains the only curative treatment for myelofibrosis (MF). Due to high incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) in patients with MF who underwent allo-HCT with myeloablative conditioning (MAC), transplants in these patients are mostly done by utilizing a reduced intensity conditioning regimen with calcineurin inhibitors for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. We previously published very good outcomes in patients with acute leukemia (AML and ALL) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who underwent Ex- vivo CD34+-selected T-cell depleted (TCD) allo-HSCT following MAC regimens (Barba P et al. BBMT 2017; Tamari R et al. BBMT 2018). Aim: To study retrospectively the outcomes of patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis (PMF or SMF) who underwent a CD34+ cell-selected Allo-HSCT. Methods : Twenty-one MF patients who underwent a CD34+-selected Allo-HSCT at a single center between October 2010 and November 2017 were included in this retrospective analysis. All patients received MAC regimen including busulfan, melphalan and fludarabine and antithymocyte globulin to prevent graft rejection. None of the patients received post-transplant GVHD prophylaxis. G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cell grafts were depleted of T-cells using immunomagnetic CD34+ selection by CliniMACS device. Overall survival (OS), relapse free survival (RFS), relapse, NRM and the composite endpoint of GVHD-free/relapse-free survival (GFRS: defined as grade 3-4 acute GVHD, chronic GVHD requiring systemic treatment, relapse, or death) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier and cumulative incidence method, with death considered a competing risk for relapse. Log-rank and Gray's tests were used to assess differences in patient and treatment characteristics. Results: Patient's and donor's characteristics are summarized in table 1. Neutrophils engraftment occurred in all patients at a median of 11 days (range: 8 - 14) and 90% (N = 19) achieved platelet engraftment at a median of 24 days (range, 14 - 77). Another patient achieved platelet engraftment only after splenectomy which was performed on post-transplant day 54. With a median follow-up of 54.06 months, the estimated 3-year OS and RFS were 84.4 % (95% CI, 69.6% to >99.9%) and 74.7% (95% CI, 57.6 to 96.9%), respectively (figure 1). The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD at day 100 was 33.3% (95% CI 11.2-54.1%); majority (N=5) had grade II and 2 patients had grade III (N=1) and grade IV (N=1) acute GVHD. Chronic GVHD developed in 2 patients including only 1 case requiring systemic treatment. The 3-year cumulative incidence rate of relapse was 9.5% (95% CI, <0.1 to 22.4%); three relapse cases include 2 patients with molecular/cytogenetic relapse and 1 patient with clinical relapse. Patients who relapsed were treated with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) (N=1), with azacytidine plus DLI (N=1) and both are alive with minimal molecular disease. The 3 rd patient is alive without evidence of disease recurrence 43 months after second unmodified Allo-HSCT from the original donor. NRM at 3 years was 15.6% (95% CI, <0.1% to 32.4%) and the cause of all deaths (n=3) was primarily attributed to acute GVHD. The estimated 3-year GRFS was 66.7% (95% CI, 49.3 to 90.2%) (figure 2). TCD boost and unmodified boost were conducted successfully for patients with poor graft function (N=1) and late graft failure (N=1). Six patients received 8 DLIs for the following indications: mixed chimerism (N=3), relapse (N=3) and poor immune reconstitution (N=2). Conclusions: In this analysis we demonstrate that CD34+ selected Allo-HSCT following a chemotherapy only based MAC regimen is well-tolerated and an effective treatment for patients with myelofibrosis. We noted higher incidence of acute GVHD when compared to our reported outcomes in patients with acute leukemia and MDS undergoing a CD34+ selected allo-HSCT and all cases of mortality in this analysis were secondary to GVHD. This may suggest differences in the biology of the diseases and a more inflammatory milieu in pts with MF. Relapse incidence was notably low and all patients who relapsed were salvaged with further cellular therapy suggesting a strong graft-versus-leukemia effect in this disease.
