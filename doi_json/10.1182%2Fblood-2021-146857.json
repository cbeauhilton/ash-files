    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Primary mediastinal B cells lymphoma (PMBCL) is a rare subtype of aggressive non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Despite therapeutic progresses, 10 to 30% of PMBCL patients are primary refractory or experience early relapses (R/R). Despite Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT) after bridging therapy or new therapies such as PD-1 inhibitors or CAR-T cells, R/R PMBL patients have a very poor outcome. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is thus a potentially curative treatment for patients who relapsed after salvage therapies. Only limited data have been published about allo-SCT in R/R PMBCL (Herrera A. F, BBMT 2019). In the present study conducted on behalf the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Francophone de Greffe de Moelle et de Th\u00e9rapie Cellulaire (SFGM-TC) and the lymphoma study association (LYSA) group, we investigated the outcomes of allo-transplanted adult R/R PMBCL. Methods This multicenter retrospective study included all adult R/R PMBCL patients reported to the SFGM-TC and who underwent an allo-HCT between 1999 and 2018. Data have been obtained through ProMISe (internet-based system shared by all European transplantation centers) and completed by consulting the medical files of the LYSA group centers. All patients have given signed informed consent. Results Thirty-three patients with R/R PMBCL from 19 French (n=29) and 3 Belgium (n=4) centers were included. The median age at transplant was 33 y (18-61), with a predominance of female patients (58%). Majority of patients had a low HCT-CI score [0 = 9/17 (53%), data missing in 16 patients]. Seventy-six percent of patients had an IPI score between 1 and 2 and Ann Harbor score was \u2265 3 in 56.6% at diagnosis. Median number of treatment lines before allo-HCT was 3 (1-6). All patients received poly-chemotherapies with anthracyclines and anti-CD20 as first-line therapy. Most sixty-one percent of patients had previously undergone auto-HCT and one patient received CAR-T before allo-HCT. Forty one percent of patients were primary refractory. At time of transplant, 50% of patients were in complete response, 40% in partial response, and 10% had a progressive disease. Conditioning regimen was reduced intensity regimen in 63%. Stem cell source was PBSC in 88%. Donors were sibling in 42% or matched related donor in 39%. An alternative donor was chosen in 18%. GVHD prophylaxis included antithymocyte globulin in 61%, and calcineurin inhibitor in 97%. Median follow up was 78 months (3.5-157). Considering the whole cohort, 2y OS, DFS, NRM, and cumulative incidence of relapse were 48% (95%CI: 33-70), 60% (95%CI: 44-82), 18% (95%CI: 7-34), and 34% (95%CI: 18-50) respectively. Cumulative incidences of day 100 grade I-II and III-IV acute GVHD 36% and 0%, respectively. Cumulative incidence was 32% among whom 33% had an extensive cGVHD. Patients with progressive disease at transplantation had worst 2y PFS and OS (PFS: HR: 6.12, 95%CI: 1.32-28.31, p=0.02 and OS: HR: 7.04, 95%CI: 1.52-32.75, p=0.013). Conclusion : To our knowledge, this is the largest published study evaluating outcomes of allo-HCT for R/R PMBCL. Although this is a retrospective study with a limited number of patients, the outcomes suggest that allo-HCT is a therapeutic option providing durable remissions for patients with R/R PMBCL.
