    "abstract_text": "Background Ofatumumab is a human IgG1-kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to CD20 on normal B cells and on B chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, resulting in B cell lysis. Ofatumumab has single-agent activity in patients (pts) with refractory CLL (Wierda, JCO 2010). Pts with CLL who have early stage disease (Rai 0-II) but have high-risk prognostic markers such as deletion 17p or deletion 11q have an increased risk of disease progression. Currently, these pts are offered watch-and-wait approach. The objective of this Phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy of ofatumumab in treating these pts with the goal to delay time to first chemoimmunotherapy treatment. Methods Pts with CLL/SLL were eligible provided they had high-risk for progression based on the presence of at least one of the following features: Rai stage II, serum beta-2 microglobulin (\u03b22M) \u22653 mg/L, absolute lymphocyte count \u226525,000/\u00b5L, unmutated (\u22642%) IGHV gene or mutated IGHV3-21, ZAP70 positive, CD38 positive (\u2265 30%), or 11q or 17p deletion by FISH. Pts having a 2008 IWCLL/NCI-WG indication for CLL treatment were not eligible. Pts with Rai stage III-IV CLL were not eligible. Ofatumumab 300 mg dose 1, then 1000 mg weekly for 7 additional weeks (8 doses) was administered. Response assessment, including bone marrow evaluation, was done at least 2 months after last dose of ofatumumab and pts were followed for progression-free survival and time to first chemoimmunotherapy. Results Twenty-five pts (9 women, 16 men) were enrolled so far. The median age was 59 yrs (range, 40-81). The baseline characteristics are listed in the Table. Fifty percent of pts had unmutated IGHV gene. Thirty-four percent of pts had high-risk cytogenetic by FISH analysis. The median follow-up on the study is 4.7 months (range, 0.5-26). Grade 3-4 adverse events included infusion reaction in 6 pts. Autoimmune hepatitis with grade 4 ALT, grade 4 AST, and grade 4 alkaline phosphatase elevations was seen in 1 pt. Other grade 3-4 toxicities included rash (1 pt), shingles (1 pt), and tumor lysis (1 pt). Tumor lysis was seen in the pt with the WBC count of 207 K/\u00b5L. Eighteen pts (7 too early) are evaluable for response. Responses are as follows: 6 CR, 3 nPR, 3 PR, and 6 with stable disease. Three pts have progressed at 18.8, 14.1 and 3.2 months after starting the study treatment; 2 pts had unmutated IGHV gene (FISH negative) and one pt had trisomy 12 ( IGHV mutation status unknown). None of the pts with deletion 17p or deletion 11q have progressed. All pts are alive at this time. The median overall follow up time is 7.6 months (range, 1-28). Conclusions Ofatumumab is well tolerated in pts with early stage CLL and may delay time to first chemoimmunotherapy.  Characteristic . N=25 .
