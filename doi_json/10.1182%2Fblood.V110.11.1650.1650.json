    "abstract_text": "Relapse of AML/MDS after allogeneic SCT is associated with poor outcome. A subset of patients (pts) can be salvaged with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) with or without preceding chemotherapy or with a second SCT. It was previously speculated that pts given RIC may have a better chance to be salvaged than pts failing high-dose conditioning. To answer this question we retrospectively analyzed results of 171 SCTs for AML/ MDS with intravenous busulfan (ivBu) -based regimens. 58 pts were eligible for myeloablative conditioning and were given ivBu (12.8 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (BuCy). Among all others, 57 were given RIC consisting of fludarabine (F) and ivBu (FB2, 6.4 mg/kg) and 56 were given a modified myeloablative conditioning consisting of F and full-dose ivBu (FB4, 12.8 mg/kg). Median age was 40 (17\u201364), 60 (43\u201375) and 52 (18\u201366) years, respectively (p 6 months and < 6 months after SCT had a median survival of 7.2 and 1.4 months, respectively and estimated 2-year overall survival (OS) 22% (95C.I. 2\u201341) and 2% (95C.I. 0\u20137), respectively (p< 0.001). The 2-year OS after relapse was 20%, 0% and 4% after BuCy, FB2 and FB4, respectively (p=0.04). SCT in refractory disease was also predictive of poor outcome after relapse in univariant analysis (p<0.001). Multivariable analysis determined short remission after SCT and conditioning with FB regimens as independent factors predicting short survival after relapse, with hazard ratios of 3.3 (1.9\u20136.3, p< 0.001) and 2.0 (1.0\u20134.0, p=0.04), respectively. In conclusion the notion that pts given RIC can be salvage more easily if they relapse is not substantiated and should not be a rationale to select RIC over myeloablative conditioning. Although this observation may be explained by inability of pts ineligible for myeloablative conditioning to tolerate further intensive therapies, other mechanisms related to differences in the biology of the different transplants may be possible."
