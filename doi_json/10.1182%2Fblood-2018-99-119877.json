    "abstract_text": "The translation of genomic discoveries to the clinic is the cornerstone of precision medicine. However, incorporating next generation sequencing (NGS) of hematologic malignancies into clinical management remains limited. We describe 235 such patients who underwent integrated NGS profiling (406 genes) and analyze the alterations and their potential actionability. Overall, 227 patients (96.5%) had adequate tissue. Most common diagnoses included myelodysplastic syndrome (22.9%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (17.2%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (13.2%), acute myeloid leukemia (11%), myeloproliferative neoplasm (9.2%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (8.8%) and multiple myeloma (7.5%). Most patients (N = 197/227 (87%)) harbored \u22651 genomic alteration(s); 170/227 (75%), \u22651 potentially actionable alteration(s) targetable by an FDA-approved (mostly off-label) or an investigational agent. (Table 1) Altogether, 551 distinct alteration s were seen, most commonly involving TP53 (9.3% of patients), TET2 (4.2%), DNMT3A (3.3%), ASXL1 (2.5%), MLL (2.5%), and KRAS (2.2%). (Figure 1 and Figure 2) The median tumor mutational burden (TMB) was low (1.7 alterations/megabase); 12% of patients had intermediate or high TMB (higher TMB correlates with favorable response to anti-PD1/PDL1 inhibition in solid tumors). In conclusion, 96.5% of patients with hematologic malignancies have adequate tissue for comprehensive genomic profiling. Most patients had unique molecular signatures, and 75% had alterations that may be pharmacologically tractable with gene- or immune-targeted agents.
