    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2798 Background: Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the most common hematologic malignancy, with an estimated >65,000 new cases in the US in 2010. The indolent follicular lymphoma (FL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) subtypes account for approximately 22% and 10% of cases, respectively. Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone, with doxorubicin (R-CHOP) or without (R-CVP) are the most common regimens used for frontline and relapsed/refractory FL. Bortezomib (VELCADE \u00ae ) has shown activity alone and with rituximab in relapsed/refractory FL/MZL, and also in combination with chemo-immunotherapy regimens such as R-CHOP. However, overlapping peripheral neuropathy (PN) with vincristine may limit bortezomib dosing. Thus, the aim of this phase 2, two-arm, non-randomized, multicenter study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of administering bortezomib in place of vincristine in the R-CHOP and R-CVP regimens. Methods: Patients aged \u226518 years with relapsed or refractory FL (including transformed FL) or MZL following \u22651 prior chemotherapy, \u22651 measurable tumor mass, ECOG performance status \u22642, no grade \u22652 residual toxicity from previous therapy/surgery, no grade \u22652 PN, and adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function were eligible. Based on investigator preference, patients received up to six 21-day cycles of bortezomib 1.6 mg/m 2 IV on days 1 and 8, rituximab 375 mg/m 2 IV on day 1, and prednisone 100 mg PO on days 1\u20135, plus either cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m 2 IV (VR-CP arm), or cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 IV and doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2 IV (VR-CAP arm) on day 1. All patients then received rituximab 375 mg/m 2 IV every 3 months for \u22642 years as maintenance. The primary endpoint was complete response (CR) rate, determined after all patients completed the 12-week follow-up visit. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR; CR + partial response [PR]), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety/tolerability. Response was assessed by investigators using modified International Workshop Response Criteria. Toxicities were graded using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. Results: A total of 55 patients have been enrolled, 48 to VR-CP and 7 to VR-CAP; reasons for selecting VR-CP included extent of prior anthracycline therapy (56%), study center preference (25%), response to prior R-CVP (13%), and age (10%). Of the 48 VR-CP patients, 50% were male, 88% were white, median age was 63.5 years (range 40\u201385), 47 had FL (52/33/15% grade 1/2/3; 19/43/38% low/intermediate/high risk by FL International Prognostic Index [FLIPI]), and 1 had MZL. Median number of prior lines of therapy was 2 (range 1\u201310), which included R-CHOP in 27 (56%), rituximab in 19 (40%), and R-CVP in 7 (15%) patients. Of 47 evaluable patients, 14 (30%) achieved CR and 23 (49%; including 1 MZL) PR (ORR 79%). Median DOR and PFS have not been reached. Patients received a median of 6 (range 2\u20136) cycles of VR-CP; 40 (83%) received all 6 cycles, and 28 (58%) have continued into the rituximab maintenance phase. All patients reported \u22651 adverse event (AE), including 65% with grade \u22653 AEs, and 25% with serious AEs. Most common AEs included diarrhea (52%), nausea (46%), fatigue (44%), neutropenia (31%), constipation, and vomiting (each 23%); grade \u22653 AEs included neutropenia (27%), lymphopenia (10%), and thrombocytopenia (6%). The incidence of PN was 21% (2% grade \u22653). Four (8%) patients discontinued due to AEs. Of 7 VR-CAP patients (2 male, 7 white, median age 57 years [range 55\u201373]), 4 had FL (3 grade 1, 1 unknown; all FLIPI high-risk), 2 MZL, and 1 chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Median number of prior lines of therapy was 1 (range 1\u20138). Of 6 response-evaluable patients, 0/4 achieved CR/PR (3 FL, 1 MZL; ORR 67%). Five patients received all 6 cycles; 4 have continued into rituximab maintenance. AEs included fatigue (n=5), alopecia, neutropenia (each n=4), anemia, constipation, nausea, rigors, and thrombocytopenia (each n=3). Neutropenia (n=4) was the only grade \u22653 AE reported in >1 patient. PN was seen in 2 patients (no grade 3). Two patients had serious AEs. There have been no on-study deaths in either arm. Conclusion: These results indicate that VR-CP is active, with a 30% CR rate, in patients with relapsed or refractory FL/MZL, including those who had received prior chemo-immunotherapy. Prolonged follow-up is required to evaluate DOR and PFS; updated results will be presented.
