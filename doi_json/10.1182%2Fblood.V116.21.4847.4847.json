    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4847 Objective: To investigate the prevalence of p53 gene deletion in leukemia patients with complex chromosome abnormalities (CCA) and their relative prognostic impact. Methods: The chromosome abnormalities in acute leukemia cases with R banding method, karyotype is named according to international nomenclature ISCN 2005. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) determinations were performed to detect the percentage and frequency of p53 gene deletion in 38 leukemia patients with CCA and 24 patients without CCA. The rate of complete remission (CR) and median survival time (MST) were observed between the two groups in patients with CCA or without CCA. Results: (1) Complex karyotype abnormality in the leukemia patients involved in almost all of chromosomes, especially chromosome 17, chromosome 5, and chromosome 7. And the reduction of chromosome number was more common than the increase. (2) The threshold of two green and one red (2G1R) was 7%, the threshold of one green and one red (1G1R) was 4.9%. (3) The percentage of p53 gene deletion was 44.74% in CCA group and 4.16% in non-CCA group ( p <0.0001). (4) p53 gene deletions were found in 9 of 10 cases with chromosome 17 abnormalities. The percentage of p53 gene deletion was achieved in 90%. (5) The CR rate was 57.14% and the MST was 31 months in patients with non-CCA compared to 11.76% CR rate and 2 months MST in patients with CCA ( p <0.0001). Conclusion: The deletion of p53 gene appears to be associated with complex chromosome abnormalities and may play an important role in the prognosis of patients with leukemia Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
