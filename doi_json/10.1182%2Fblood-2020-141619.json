    "abstract_text": "Introduction Immunotherapy offers the promise of a new paradigm for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). CD123, the IL-3 receptor alpha-chain, represents an attractive target for antibody therapies because of its high expression on AML/MDS blasts and leukemic stem cells compared to normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. APVO436, a novel bispecific anti-CD123 x anti-CD3 ADAPTIR\u2122 molecule, depleted CD123+ cells in AML patient samples ex vivo (Godwin et al. ASH 2017), reduced leukemia engraftment in a systemic AML xenograft model (Comeau et al. AACR 2018), and transiently reduced peripheral CD123+ cells in non-human primates with minimal cytokine release and in a dose-dependent fashion (Comeau et al. AACR 2019). These data provide a basis for the clinical application of APVO436 as a treatment in AML and MDS. Here, we report preliminary data from a first-in-human dose-escalation study of APVO436 in patients with R/R AML and high-risk MDS. Study Design/Methods This ongoing Phase 1/1b study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03647800) was initiated to determine the safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity of APVO436 as a single agent. Major inclusion criteria were: R/R AML with no other standard treatment option available, R/R MDS with > 5% marrow blasts or any peripheral blasts and failure of a hypomethylating agent, ECOG performance status \u2264 2, life expectancy > 2 months, white blood cells \u2264 25,000 cells/mm 3 , creatinine \u2264 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN), INR and PTT < 1.5 x ULN and alanine aminotransferase < 3 x ULN. Patients were not restricted from treatment due to cytogenetic or mutational status. Intravenous doses of APVO436 were administered weekly for up to six 28-day cycles (24 doses) with the option to continue dosing for up to 36 total cycles (144 doses). Flat and step dosing regimens were escalated using a safety-driven modified 3 + 3 design. Pre-medication with diphenhydramine, acetaminophen, and dexamethasone was administered starting with dose 1 to mitigate infusion related reactions (IRR) and cytokine release syndrome (CRS). First doses and increasing step doses of APVO436 were infused over 20-24 hours followed by an observation period of 24 hours or more. Bone marrow biopsies were performed every other cycle with responses assessed by European Leukemia Net 2017 criteria for AML or International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria for MDS. Results The data cut-off for this interim analysis was July 9, 2020. Twenty-eight patients with primary R/R AML (n=19), therapy-related R/R AML (n=3), or high-risk MDS (n=6) have been enrolled and received a cumulative total of 186 doses. The number of doses received per patient ranged from 1 to 43 (mean of 6.4 doses). Most patients discontinued treatment due to progressive disease; however, blast reduction was achieved in 2 patients, with one patient with MDS maintaining a durable response for 11 cycles before progressing. APVO436 was tolerated across all dose regimens in all cohorts tested. The most common adverse events (AEs), regardless of causality, were edema (32%), diarrhea (29%), febrile neutropenia (29%), fever (25%), hypokalemia (25%), IRR (21%), CRS (18%), chills (18%), and fatigue (18%). AEs \u2265 Grade 3 occurring in more than one patient were: febrile neutropenia (25%), anemia (18%), hyperglycemia (14%), decreased platelet count (11%), CRS (11%), IRR (7%), and hypertension (7%). After observing a single dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at a flat dose of 9 \u00b5g, step dosing was implemented and no DLTs have been observed thereafter. No treatment-related anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were observed. Transient serum cytokine elevations occurred after several reported IRR and CRS events, with IL-6 most consistently elevated. Conclusions Preliminary results indicate that APVO436 is tolerated in patients with R/R AML and MDS at the doses and schedules tested to date, with a manageable safety profile. Dose escalation continues and the results will be updated for this ongoing study.
