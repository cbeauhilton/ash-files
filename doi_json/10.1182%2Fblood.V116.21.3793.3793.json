    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3793 Introduction: Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a clonal proliferative disease of antigen presenting cells. Clinically, it is associated with aberrant secretion of cytokines from both Langerhans cells (LCs) themselves and immune cells associated with the disease. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are membranous and cytoplasmic proteins involved in pattern-based recognition of bacterial and viral products. Activation of TLRs results in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, modulation of the immune response, and maturation of LCs. TLRs activate signal transduction pathways involving IRFs (interferon regulatory factors), NFkB (Nuclear Factor-k-B) and MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinases). In this study, we have examined LCH samples for their expression of TLRs and downstream effector proteins. Methods: We examined archived samples from 42 LCH patients. Paraffin embedded samples were sectioned and stained for immunohistochemistry (IHC) using antibodies directed against TLR1-9; IRF3, 7 and 8; MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. RNA was isolated from the same samples using laser-capture microdissection, and the expression of TLR receptors, effectors and downstream targets was analyzed using qRT-PCR. These data were compared with gene expression data published in Gene Expression Omnibus using data set GSE16395 . Results: IHC results showed upregulation in pathologic LCs compared to normal LCs of TLR 1, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9, but not TLR 4 and 6. Moreover, upregulation of downstream pathways involving MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 and IRF8 in was also observed in pathologic LCs. Gene expression analysis showed up-regulation of the effectors of TLRs including CASP8, MAP3K7, and PPARA as well as genes in the NFKB pathway (CCL2, NFKb1, NFKB2, NFKBIL1, NFRKB, and REL), the JNK/p-38 pathway (ELK1, c-FOS, MAP3K1 and MAP3K8), and the interferon regulatory factor pathway (CXCL10, IRF7, IRF8 and TBK1). Comparison with the gene expression data base confirmed the results obtained from qRT-PCR for the gene expression of TLRs, their effectors, and downstream. Conclusion: Upregulation of TLRs and the pathways they control occurs commonly in LCH. Therapies directed toward inhibition of TLRs and their downstream targets may provide a means of modulating the adverse inflammatory aspects of LCH.
