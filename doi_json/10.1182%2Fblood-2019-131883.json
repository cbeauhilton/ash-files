    "abstract_text": "Self-renewal is a key feature of the cells that initiate acute myeloid leukemia. To identify the mechanisms involved in PML-RARA (PR) -driven self-renewal, we made use of Ctsg-PR mice, which have PR knocked into the UTR of the first exon of Ctsg . Ctsg-PR drives the expression of PR in myeloid progenitor cells and gives these cells the ability to serially replate in methylcellulose-based colony assays. Most Ctsg-PR mice develop acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with an average latency of ~300 days. To identify target genes regulated by Ctsg-PR , we performed single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on whole bone marrow from young, preleukemic Ctsg-PR mice or age-matched littermates. We identified 959 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within myeloid progenitors (546 upregulated by PR, and 413 downregulated). Gata2 was identified as a DEG in this analysis, and we confirmed this phenotype with bulk RNA-seq of purified promyelocytes from young, preleukemic WT vs. Ctsg-PR mice. All APLs derived from Ctsg-PR mice also expressed high levels of Gata2 . To identify the immediate-early target genes of PR , we transduced human CD34+ cord blood cells with MSCV-IRES-GFP retroviruses containing PR , a mutant PR with a RARA DNA binding mutation (C88A, known to abolish PR replating), or an empty vector. ScRNA-seq analysis of these cells after 7 days of ex vivo culture identified 1815 DEGs (1301 upregulated and 514 downregulated by PR ) in GFP+ cells expressing PR , compared to GFP+ cells transduced with PR C88A or empty vector. Among the DEGs, Gata2 was upregulated 5-fold in the PR GFP+ cells. Identical short-term retroviral overexpression studies with mouse marrow revealed that PR expression caused an expansion of hematopoietic progenitor cells that overexpressed Gata2 . Finally, although normal human promyelocytes do not express GATA2 , virtually all primary human APL samples do. Combined, these studies strongly suggest that GATA2 is a target gene of PR , and may therefore play a role in the development of APL. Based on our expression data, we hypothesized that Gata2 inactivation would reduce PR -driven self-renewal. To test this hypothesis, we bred Ctsg-PR mice to Rosa26-Cas9 mice, which ubiquitously express Cas9. Marrow from the resulting Ctsg-PR x Cas9 mice was electroporated with guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting the zinc finger 1 (ZF1) domain or exon 2 of Gata2, or control loci ( Actb intron 5 or Rosa26 intron 1) and serially replated in methylcellulose with SCF, IL-3, and IL-6. CRISPR-Cas9 efficiently induced a wide array of indel mutations at all gRNA target sites. Two days after electroporation, the frequency of Gata2 alleles with indels at the target site ranged from 64% to 93% (n=4); hundreds of different Gata2 indels were generated in each experiment. To our surprise, the Gata2 targeted Ctsg-PR cells replated with dramatically higher efficiency than control locus targeted cells ( Figure 1 ). The enhanced replating efficiency was dependent upon PR , since Gata2 targeted Rosa26-Cas9 bone marrow did not serially replate. Further, cells with Gata2 indels were positively selected for over time. For example, in one experiment, the frequency of a 12 bp deletion in Gata2 (that caused an in-frame deletion in ZF1) rose from an initial variant allele frequency (VAF) of 3% to 70% after 8 weeks of replating. A larger Gata2 deletion was co-selected at a similar frequency, and resulted in the deletion of Gata2 exon 4, which encodes 90% of ZF1. Virtually all of the positively selected cells contained Gata2 indels, demonstrating the competitive advantage of Gata2 loss-of-function mutations in this setting. Control gRNAs did not lead to significant changes in plating efficiency, nor were any indels selected for. Additionally, Ctsg-PR x Cas9 cells with Gata2 indels shifted from a neutrophilic phenotype (Gr1+ CD11b+) to a monocytic one (CD11b+ Gr1-) at late passages. To further investigate the role of Gata2 in Ctsg-PR induced APL, we sequenced the genomes of 16 mouse APLs and found that 2 samples had spontaneous mutations in Gata2 (R330L and N363fs, with VAFs of 74% and 39% respectively). In summary, these data provide evidence that PR positively regulates Gata2 , and that Gata2 in turn promotes neutrophilic differentiation of committed, \"reprogrammed\" myelomonocytic progenitors. Surprisingly, Gata2 appears to contribute to the lineage fate and proliferative capacity of PR -expressing hematopoietic progenitor cells.
