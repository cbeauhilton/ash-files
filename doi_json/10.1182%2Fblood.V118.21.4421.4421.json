    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4421 The coexistence of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the same patient is rare. A 61-year-old man developed a lymphocytosis with morphologic and immunophenotypic feature of B-CLL (stage I according to the modified Rai classification), without indications for treatment. Ten months later he presented with a markedly elevated leukocytes count and splenomegaly. Myeloblasts, promyelocytes, myelocytes and metamyelocytes appeared in his peripheral blood. A bone marrow aspirate was hypercellular with an increased proportion of the myeloid series in all maturative stages; the percentage of lymphocytes was 3%. The immunophenotypic study demonstrated the typical feature of chronic phase of CML, simultaneously 2% of CD5+ CD19+ cells have been found. Unstimulated bone marrow culture shoved a 46,XY,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) karyotype, and interphase FISH detected the presence of BCR/ABL fusion with 4,55\u00d710 6 of p 210 and 1,55\u00d710 3 of p 190 copies/ml. Previously it has been shown that these two different hematological malignancies derive from distinct progenitors. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
