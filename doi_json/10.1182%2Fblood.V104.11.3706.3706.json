    "abstract_text": "The fact that the average hemoglobin concentration (Hb) of AA is lower than that of whites has been documented extensively. Several investigations have shown that this difference of approximately 0.8 g/dL is due neither to iron deficiency nor to socioeconomic status. Its cause remains unknown. We compared the Hb of 1,493 AA and 31,029 white anonymized patients attending a Health Appraisal Clinic and confirmed the known difference in Hb, both for females and males (0.79 and 0.47 g/dL) respectively. The difference persisted when a subset of the subjects were paired by age and narrowed slightly in females when those with serum ferritin levels of 9 ng/ml and a transferrin saturation of >16%. Excluding subjects with sickle trait had no effect.  . Ethnic Group . Genotype . n . Mean Hb . SE Hb . Mean MCV .

We conclude that one cause of the lower Hb of AA compared to white subjects is the high prevalence of \u03b1-thalassemia in the AA population, but that it accounts for only about one-quarter of the difference after iron deficiency has been excluded. There are other, as yet undefined, causes that play a role. These may include the lower ATP ( Biochem. Genet.  1 : 25 , 1967 ) and higher 2,3 BPG ( Transfusion  18 : 108 , 1978 ) levels that have been documented in the red cells of AA subjects.",
