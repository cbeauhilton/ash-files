    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND. Tissue factor (TF) is critical for hemostasis. However, TF also plays a pathogenic role in a multitude of diseases, including: thrombosis, coagulation-associated inflammation, multi-organ failure associated with infections, tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI), the regulator of TF actions, produces FXa-dependent feedback inhibition of the FVIIa/TF catalytic complex, directly inhibits FXa, and suppresses cellular signaling by FVIIa/TF/FXa complexes. In man, TFPI is expressed as isoforms TFPI\u03b1 and TFPI\u03b2. The pathophysiologic impacts of the individual \u03b1 and \u03b2 isoforms have yet to be elucidated. Mouse models have been used extensively to provide insight into human physiology and disease, including abnormalities concerning hemostasis and TF-associated diseases. Like man, mice express TFPI \u03b1 and \u03b2, but unlike man, mice express a third transcript encoding TFPI\u03b3. In fact, we recently reported that the vast majority (98%) of TFPI in mouse plasma is derived from TFPI\u03b3. We also reported that anti-TFPI antibodies enhance in vitro thrombin generation in hemophilia mouse plasma that contains only the TFPI\u03b3 isoform, which demonstrated that TFPI\u03b3 possesses anticoagulant activity. RESULTS. We report herein that, while complete TFPI gene deletion is 100% embryonic lethal, TFPI\u03b3 only mice [TFPI\u03b1\u03b2(-/-)] are viable and reproduce. Offspring genotypes from parents with intact TFPI\u03b3(+/+) exons and TFPI\u03b1\u03b2(+/-) were 33 TFPI\u03b1\u03b2(+/+), 57 TFPI\u03b1\u03b2(+/-) and 34 TFPI\u03b1\u03b2(-/-) at weaning. Also, TFPI\u03b3 only mice produced similar numbers of pups per litter as wild type mice. The viability of TFPI\u03b3 only mice proves endogenous mouse TFPI\u03b3 possesses substantial functional activity. TFPI\u03b1 is considered to be a much more potent anticoagulant than TFPI\u03b3. Our preliminary thrombin generation assay data suggests that the sum total anticoagulant activity of the endogenous low level (0.07 nM) of TFPI\u03b1 is similar to the sum total anticoagulant activity of the endogenous high level (3.5 nM) of TFPI\u03b3. The presence of active TFPI\u03b3 in mice, not found in man, confounds attempts to translate results from wild type mouse studies to the human condition. The extents to which TFPI\u03b3 influences the various wild type mouse models of human diseases are unknown. The presence of mouse TFPI\u03b3 also precludes our ability to properly distinguish the roles of TFPI \u03b1 and \u03b2 isoforms independently. Deletion of the TFPI\u03b3 exon eliminates this confounder. Fortunately, in TFPI\u03b1\u03b2 mice the levels, properties and location of TFPI\u03b1 and TFPI\u03b2 in mice reflect those in man. Importantly, we can now report that our CRISPR-Cas9-generated TFPI\u03b3 KO strains - TFPI\u03b1\u03b2 mice, TFPI\u03b1 only mice, and TFPI\u03b2 only mice are viable and reproduce. To illustrate the potential influence of TFPI\u03b3 in a mouse model, we used a tail vein-rebleeding assay to assess bleeding in TFPI isoform-specific mice in a FVIII KO background. Reported as mean number of clots per 15 minutes, results were: 4.8 for hemophilia controls; 25.4 for controls with FVIII replacement; 4.2 for TFPI\u03b1 KOs; and 13.5 for TFPI\u03b2\u03b3 KOs. (The S.E.M. of each group was 0.5 vs controls), whereas deletion of TFPI\u03b2 and \u03b3 improves hemostasis ( P<0.001 vs controls). In hemophilia mice, suppressing TFPI\u03b1 was without effect. We don't expect this observation to translate to man. Rather, suppressing TFPI\u03b1 in man is anticipated to enhance coagulation in hemophilia patients. (Note, multiple trials show that TFPI antibodies that inhibit all TFPI forms enhance coagulation). Moreover, in the absence of the confounding influence of TFPI\u03b3, we anticipate suppression of TFPI\u03b1 will improve coagulation and reduce bleeding in TFPI\u03b3 deleted hemophilia mice. Further studies in our TFPI\u03b3 deleted strains are necessary to determine if this prediction is correct and could influence future anti-TFPI approaches for man. CONCLUSIONS. 1.) Endogenous mouse TFPI\u03b3 possesses significant functional activity. 2.) TFPI\u03b3 confounds the extrapolation of results in wild type mouse models to human diseases. 3.) The TFPI\u03b3 KO mouse possesses a TFPI\u03b1\u03b2 profile that is similar to man. 4.) For essentially all studies of human TF-associated diseases in mouse models, it would be prudent to delete TFPI\u03b3. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
