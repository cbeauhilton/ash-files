    "abstract_text": "Abstract 892 The myeloablative, reduced toxicity regimen, IV Busulfan (Bu) and fludarabine (Flu), is effective conditioning for allogeneic stem cell transplantation for treatment of patients with AML and MDS. We performed a prospective randomized study to optimize the antileukemic cytoreduction of this regimen, testing the hypothesis that pharmacokinetically (PK-) guided IV Bu-dosing to an average daily AUC of 6,000 \u03bcMol-min yields improved leukemia-free survival compared with a fixed IV Bu dose of 130 mg/m2, which gives a median AUC of approximately 5000 \u03bcMol-min. The study was approved by the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center IRB and all patients provided informed consent. 139 patients were in a first or second complete remission (CR), 86 were not in remission, including patients with marrow remission but with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) or with active disease. Median age was 50 years (range 13\u201365). 51% received a transplant from a related donor and 49% had unrelated donors. 28% patients received bone marrow and 72% PBPC grafts. Disease characteristics are summarized in the following table. Median follow-up of surviving patients was 25 months (2\u201366).

Overall survival at 3 years for the two groups was 57% (46\u201368%) vs 47% (36\u201357%) p=0.2. View large Download slide View large Download slide The greatest effect was seen in patients not in remission at the time of transplant. The cumulative incidence of disease progression for the PK Guided and Fixed dose groups was 20% and 25% in patients transplanted in remission (P=0.5), and 29% and 50% for patients transplanted not in remission (P=0.03). Major outcomes are summarized in the following table. There was no significant difference in toxicity pattern, incidence of acute GVHD or treatment related mortality between the PK-guided/adjusted and fixed- dose groups. In multivariate analysis, poor risk cytogenetics and flt3 mutation was associated with inferior PFS.
