    "abstract_text": "We have analyzed the incidence and risk factors for developing a secondary malignancy (SM) in patients with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (HL) treated with an autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). From 639 patients autografted for HL [383 males and 256 females with a median age of 30 (1\u201366) years and a median follow-up after ASCT of 53 (3\u2013202) months] reported to the GEL/TAMO Spanish Cooperative Group between January/1984 and January/2003, 37 patients (6% of the series) developed a SM at a median time of 35 months after ASCT [24 patients (65%) a myelodisplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 3 patients (8%) a non Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) and 10 patients (29%) a solid tumor (ST)]. There were 24 males and 13 females with a median age of 39 (13\u201360) years [23 patients (61%), 24 months in 23 patients (62%). Twenty-three patients (62%) were in CR when they developed the SM and the remaining 14 (38%), had active disease. Median time to develop a myeloid malignancy was of 12 (4 \u2013 34) months, to develop a lymphoid malignancy (T cell NHL, 2 patients; B cell NHL, 1 patient) was of 23 (12 \u2013 31) months and to develop a ST (2 squamous cell carcinomas of the lung, 2 rabdomisarcomas, 2 adenocarcinomas of the rectum, 1 basocelular carcinoma, 2 in situ bladder carcinoma and one oropharyngeal carcinoma) of 60 (34 \u2013 91) months, respectively (p = 0.0001). Twenty eight patients have died: 18 patients (64%) due to the SM and 10 (36%) due to HL progression. Multivariate analysis identified age at ASCT > 40 years and the time between diagnosis and ASCT > 24 months as the only two bad prognostic factors for developing a SM [relative risk (RR) 2.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.20\u20135.10), p = 0.01 and 2.17, 95%CI (1.06\u20134.46), p = 0.034], respectively. The risk of developing a SM is a real long time side effect after an autologous procedure in HL patients. Advanced age at ASCT and a long time interval between diagnosis and ASCT, a probable surrogate marker of the amount of CT given to the patient before the ASCT have been, in our experience, the only two risk factors for developing this complication.",
