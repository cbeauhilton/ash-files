    "abstract_text": "Genetic analysis has an increasing role in the diagnosis, classification, and management of patients with CLL. Although translocations involving the IgH locus are well characterized in B-cell malignancies such as follicular cell lymphoma, their frequency and significance in CLL are less well defined. We studied a series of patients with a clinical diagnosis of CLL using a FISH probe set including IgH. Methods: FISH was performed on blood using a DNA probe set designed to detect common chromosome anomalies associated with CLL and translocations involving IgH. Patients with an IgH abnormality were further studied using FISH probes sets for IgH and cyclin D1, BCL-2, BCL-3, BCL-6, BCL-11a, c-MYC, MALT-1, c-MAF, FGFR-3 or PAX-5. The clinical presentation, pathology, and flow cytometric immunophenotype was reviewed in patients with various translocations involving IgH. Results: Between 1/1/03 and 6/15/04, samples from 1032 patients with a clinical diagnosis of CLL were analyzed by FISH. Of these, 76 patients (7%) had translocations involving the IgH locus. Sixty one patients had a single translocation partner gene (cyclin D1 45%, BCL-2 24%, BCL-3 8%, c-MYC 2.5%, or BCL-11a 1.3%). Two patients had two independent clones (cyclin D1 and BCL-2; BCL-3 and BCL-11a). In 13 pts (17%) we could not identify the translocation partner. Thirty five (46%) of the 76 patients with IgH translocations had been seen at Mayo Clinic Rochester and had clinical and laboratory data for detailed review. Among these 35 patients, 16 (45%) had fusion of IgH and cyclin D1 and were diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The immunophenotype of the monoclonal B cells was typical of MCL (CD5+, CD23-) in 6 patients and typical of CLL (CD5+, CD23+) in 4 patients. Six MCL patients had non-diagnostic immunophenotypes: CD5-, CD 23+ (n = 3) and CD5-, CD23- (n = 3). Twelve (34%) of the 35 patients had the IGH/BCL-2 fusion gene. Of these, 3 patients had leukemic phase follicular lymphoma, one had both CLL and MCL, and 8 had the diagnostic immunophenotype of CLL. The remaining 7 patients (19%) had a variety of translocation partners: BCL-3 (n = 1), BCL-3 and BCL-11a (n = 1), c-MYC (n = 2), and unknown (n = 3). The patients with a translocation involving BCL-3 had a typical CLL immunophenotype. Discussion: The IgH FISH probe detected a molecular defect in 7% of patients with a circulating monoclonal B cell population. In patients with a CLL immunophenotype, use of the IgH probe identified the IgH/cyclin D1 translocation characteristic of MCL in 4 patients, a finding of major clinical significance. Interestingly, after exclusion of MCL patients, more than 4% patients with CLL had other translocations involving IgH, a proportion comparable with other better defined chromosomal abnormalities in CLL. Although IgH/BCL-2 translocation is usually associated with follicular lymphoma, we identified 8 patients with CLL and this translocation. Translocations involving BCL-3 had been described before in CLL with an \u201catypical\u201d immunophenotype. In contrast both of our patients with BCL-3 had typical phenotypes. Translocations involving IgH and BCL-11a have not been previously described. We conclude that FISH studies using the IgH probe improve the precision of diagnosis in CLL and could also have prognostic value.",
