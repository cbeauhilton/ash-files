    "abstract_text": "In spite of tremendous advances in the analysis of hematopoietic progenitors and transcription factors that give rise to different lineages, molecular insight into the mechanisms that underlie cell fate choice at the level of individual cells is lacking. We utilized single-cell RNA sequencing of murine granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) to analyze the molecular basis of cell fate choice. Over 200 libraries were generated with average read depths of 4 million per library and an expressed gene call of over 3,800 genes with FPKM >3. Our data reveal a varied but coherent spectrum of gene expression patterns in individual murine GMPs. The majority of cells could be clustered into ones expressing either granulocytic or monocytic genes, suggesting that they were primed for lineage determination. A minority of GMPs expressed a mixed-lineage pattern of genes. The single-cell data suggested an antagonistic transcription factor circuit involving Gfi1 and IRF8 that was validated with both loss- and gain-of-function experiments in GMPs. Our data highlight the utility of single cell RNA-Seq analysis to reveal molecular mechanisms controlling lineage fate decisions in hematopoiesis.
