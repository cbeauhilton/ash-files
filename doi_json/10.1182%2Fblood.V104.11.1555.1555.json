    "abstract_text": "The hereditary bleeding disorder Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) is caused by an absent or dysfunctional GPIb/IX complex. Lopez et al. have reported that three subunits of the complex (GPIb\u03b1, GPIb\u03b2 and GPIX) are all necessary for efficient translocation to the cell surface. In contrast, Meyer et al. have demonstrated that GPIb\u03b1 alone can incorporate into the cell surface. We have established a cell culture system with inducible levels of GPIb\u03b2 and GPIX. Using these cell lines, we characterize an intrinsic ability of GPIb\u03b1 to form dimers and the relevance of specific GPIb\u03b1 sequences for dimer formation and the assembly of a GPIb/IX complex. A stable CHO cell line was established that expresses GPIb\u03b2 and GPIX under the control of Tet-responsive elements. This cell line was then transfected with WT GPIb\u03b1 and truncated GPIb\u03b1 mutants. Expression was monitored by Western blot analysis and flow cytometry. We observed that expression of GPIb\u03b1, by itself, targets GPIb\u03b1 to the cell surface as a dimer albeit at reduced levels. The GPIb\u03b1 binding domain for filamin (residues 545\u2013605) is essential for forming a dimer but not for assembly of a GPIb/IX complex. We also observed GPIb\u03b1 dimer formation in a transgenic mouse that expresses human GPIb\u03b1 and a mouse chimeric GPIb-IX complex suggesting dimer formation can occur in the platelet. To investigate the role of filamin in the dimerization process, we established a stable cell line deficient in filamin by targeting filamin expression with RNAi. We observed GPIb\u03b1 dimers in the absence of filamin expression. These results illustrate the importance of expressing all three subunits of the GPIb/IX complex, but also document as intrinsic potential within GPIb\u03b1 for surface expression via intermolecular homodimerization."
