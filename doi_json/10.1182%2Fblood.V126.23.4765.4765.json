    "abstract_text": "Objective To detect the percentage of CD5 + B cells in peripheral blood (PB) of patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) /Evans syndrome and the expression of active molecules on CD5 + B cells. Methods The expressions of CD80, CD86, CD69 and HLA-DR on CD5 + B cells in PB of 25 cases with AIHA/Evans syndrome, (11 newly diagnosed, 14 remission) and 14 normal controls were detected by flow cytometry. Results (1) The percentage and the quantity of CD19 + B cells in newly diagnosed patients were [(22.78\u00b119.77)%, (34.47\u00b122.88)\u00d710 7 /L] respectively, which were obviously higher than those of remission patients [(6.80\u00b15.47)%,(10.09\u00b17.69)\u00d710 7 /L] and normal controls [(7.76\u00b12.6)%,(10.03\u00b13.31)\u00d710 7 /L](p<0.05), but there was no significant difference between the latter two groups. (2)The percentage of CD5 + B cells in B cells of untreated patients was [(27.44\u00b118.43) %], which was higher than that of normal controls [(13.49\u00b16.95) %, P=0.008]. The percentage of CD5 - B cells of untreated patients and normal controls were [(72.56\u00b118.43) %], [(83.92\u00b111.46) %] and there was no significant difference. (3)CD80 on CD5 + B cells of untreated patients was [(46.04\u00b126.93)%], which was obviously higher than that of remission patients [(8.82\u00b18.78)%,P=0.003] and normal controls [(6.27\u00b14.87)%,P=0.002], the latter two groups had no significant difference. There was no significant difference of CD80 on CD5 - B cells among the three groups. CD86 on CD5 + B cells of untreated patients was [(37.37\u00b124.18)%], which was significantly higher than that of remission patients [(16.53\u00b110.31)%,P=0.004] and normal controls [(14.90\u00b19.62)%,P=0.029], the latter two groups had no significant difference. But CD86 on CD5 - B cells are similar in the three groups and there was no difference. CD69 on CD5 + B cells of newly diagnosed patients was (median: 5.77%), which was higher than that of remission patients (3.34%) and normal controls(4.01%), but without any significant difference within three groups. CD69 on CD5 - B cells showed no significant difference among three groups. HLA-DR on CD5 + B cells and CD5 - B cells showed no significantly difference within three groups. (4)The expression of CD80[(46.04\u00b126.93)%] and CD86[(37.37\u00b124.18)%] on CD5 + B cells were higher than those on CD5 - B cells [(22.57\u00b110.54)%,P=0.016], [(17.92\u00b116.27)%,P=0.006]. The expression of CD69 (median: 5.77%) on CD5 + B cells was higher than that of on CD5 - B cells (median: 1.20%), but without significant difference. The expression of HLA-DR on CD5 + B cells and CD5 - B cells had no significant difference. (5)The expression of CD80 on CD5 + B cells [(8.82\u00b18.78) %] was lower than that of on CD5 - B cells [(28.68\u00b118.59) %, P=0.001]. The expression of CD86, CD69 and HLA-DR on CD5 + B cells and CD5 - B cells showed no significant difference. (6)The expression of CD80 on CD5 + B cells [(6.27\u00b14.87)%] was lower than that of on CD5 - B cells [(27.54\u00b19.42)%,P<0.05]. The expression of CD86ACD69 and HLA-DR on CD5 + B cells and CD5 - B cells had no significant difference. Conclusions The percentage and quantity of B lymphocytes in PB of AIHA/Evans syndromes patients increased. CD5 + B lymphocytes are mainly cells and CD80 and CD86 on CD5 + B cells went up. The activated molecules on cell surface may be the basis of the different function of CD5 + and CD5 - B lymphocytes. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
