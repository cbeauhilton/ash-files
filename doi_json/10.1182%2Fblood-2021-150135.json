    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Prior to the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the presence of BCR-ABL1 conferred a poor prognosis in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We published in 2017 in Br J Haematology our analysis comparing the survival of Ph-Positive (Ph+) and Ph-negative ALL during the period when TKIs were universally available in the United States for Ph+ ALL using a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Database analysis. Despite using TKIs, we have continued to remain reliant on cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) to achieve the best long-term outcomes. However, with the introduction of more potent TKIs and other novel agents, as well as better methods for monitoring minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD) the best approach is yet to be determined. In this study we present data from our institution with incorporation of TKIs in our modified USC ALL pediatric-based regimen without pegaspargase (PEG) (Table 1). Methods: This retrospective, single institution chart review included adults aged >18 with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL between 2016 and 2020. Primary objectives were Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) at 3 years for Ph+ ALL patients and secondary objectives were rates of complete remission/complete remission with incomplete recovery (CR/CRi), minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry and presence of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript by real time polymerase chain reaction. Descriptive statistics of patients were reported and evaluated using Fisher's exact test. OS and EFS were reported through Kaplan Meier curves and Log-rank tests. Two-sided p value \u22640.05 was significant. RESULTS: 26 Ph+ ALL patients were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 42.5 years, with 42.3% males and 57.7% females. Median BMI was 31.1 kg/m 2 , 42.3% had hepatic steatosis and 34.6% had CNS disease pre-induction. After induction 1, 91.3% of patients achieved CR/CRi, 8.7% were refractory, and 64.3% were MRD flow negative with 24% of patients with undetectable BCR-ABL1. After induction 2, 94.1% had achieved CR/CRi, 64.3% were MRD flow negative with 44.4% of patients with undetectable BCR-ABL1. After consolidation I, 78.6% were MRD flow negative. 50% of patients had received blinatumomab for MRD flow positivity early in the course and 34.6% underwent allo-HSCT. Of note, 65.4% of patients received Dasatinib only and 30.8% received at least 2 TKIs. Overall, 11.5% had known relapse, 12.5% died. 3-year OS was 83.3% and 3-year EFS was 86.6% (Table 2). When survival was stratified by transplant status, 3-year OS with allo-HSCT was 100% versus 70% without allo-HSCT (p=0.15) and 3-year EFS with allo-HSCT was 100% compared to 77.9% without allo-HSCT (Table 3). CONCLUSIONS: The use of the modified USC ALL regimen without PEG for the treatment of newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL combined with TKI at our institution led to an excellent 3-year OS (83.3%) and 3-year EFS (86.6%). All patients received TKI, half of the patients received blinatumomab and at least one third received allo-HSCT which likely led to higher OS even without PEG. We also observed a trend towards improved OS in recipients of allo-HSCT compared to patients who did not receive allo-HSCT (100% vs. 70%, p=0.15) although statistically not significant, it highlights the role of allo-HSCT in the management of Ph+ ALL patients.
