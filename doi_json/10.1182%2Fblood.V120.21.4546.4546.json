    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4546 Introduction: Consolidation with autologous transplantation (AutoSCT) may extend progression free survival when administered following initial induction. Published data suggest intensive cytarabine containing induction may improve outcome when administered prior to autologous transplantation. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated all patients with MCL transplanted at our institution before 2010. We identified 57 patients, among whom 52 were transplanted in first or second remission. Results: 21 patients had received a cytarabine containing induction (most commonly R-HyperCVAD), among whom 14 also received cytarabine as a component of conditioning (BEAM+/\u2212R). The most common induction in the remaining patients was R-CHOP. Among the 31 who did not receive a cytarabine based induction, 23 received cytarabine as a component of the pre-transplant conditioning regimen (BEAM+/\u2212R). The median PFS for those getting cytarbine with induction and conditioning was approximately 28 months (at which time 51% of patients continued without progression). The median PFS for those getting cytarabine with conditioning only was approximately 38 months (at which time 47% continued without progression). Logrank analysis shows no statistically significant difference between these groups (p one-sided = 0.29). Alternatively, those who did not receive any cytarabine had a median PFS of 20 months, with no survival beyond 33 months. Logrank analysis shows this to be inferior to those receiving cytarabine with induction/conditioning (p one-sided = 0.049), as well as among those who received cytarabine with conditioning only (p one-sided = 0.001). Conclusions: In the absence of randomized comparisons it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on the role of induction. These analyses would suggest that among those with chemosensitive disease able to proceed to transplant, more modern conditioning with cytarabine containing regimens may make up for lack of exposure to this agent during induction.
