    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1645 Poster Board I-671 Human Dectin-1 (hDectin-1) is a member of the C-type lectin-like receptor family that was shown to be the major receptor for fungal beta-glucans and to play an important role in the cellular responses mediated by these pathogens. Activation of Dectin-1 via extracts such as zymosan or more specifically with curdlan can lead to DC activation characterized by upregulation of surface molecules or secretion of cytokines. Futhermore, Dectin-1 is important for recruitment of leukocytes and production of inflammatory mediators at the site of infection.. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and its ligands, cyclopentenone prostaglandins or thiazolidinediones, have been shown to have profound modulatory effects on B and T lymphocytes as well as DCs. Cyclopentenone prostaglandins are produced during the late phase of inflammation due to up-regulation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), a key enzyme for the synthesis of cyclopentenone prostaglandins, that mediate their effects by activation of PPAR-gamma dependent and independent pathways. In our study we analyzed the effects of troglitazone (TGZ), a high affinity synthetic ligand of PPAR-gamma, on the Dectin-1 mediated activation of antigen presenting cells (APC). TGZ was added to the cell culture medium during the differention of monocyte derived DC. On day 5-6 of culture the cells were additionally treated with curdlan or zymosan and phenotypical and functional analyses were performed. Activation of PPAR-gamma resulted in a reduced stimulation of APC via Dectin-1 characterized by down-regulation of CD1a, CD83 and costimulatory molecules on the cell surface and reduced secretion of cytokines and chemokines involved in T-lymphocyte activation and recruitment including IL-1beta, TNF-a, IL-6, IL-12, MIP-1a and Rantes. Western blot analyses revealed that these inhibitory effects were mediated by the inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways characterized by a reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38. Furthermore, we found that Dectn-1 induced c-Jun phosphorylation was reduced by pretreatment with TGZ. In addition, Dectin-1 induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB family members RelB and cRel was dramatically reduced in APC incubated with TGZ. The observed inhibition of signaling pathways was not due to a reduced expression of Dectin-1, phosphorylation of Syk or increased secretion of IL-10 and TGF-beta. TGZ had no effect on the Dectin-1 induced phosphorylation and nuclear expression of NFAT. Our data demonstrate that PPAR-gamma ligands inhibit Dectin-1 mediated activation by interfering with the MAP kinase, c-Jun and NF-kappaB signaling pathways, thus confirming their important role as a negative feedback mechanisms in the regulation of potentially harmful inflammation signaling pathways.
