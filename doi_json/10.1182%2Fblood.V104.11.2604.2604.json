    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is a multifactorial disease caused by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The atherosclerotic plaque, the pathological hallmark of CVD, is an inflammatory process, where pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1). TNF\u03b1 secretion shows a high degree of interindividual variability, which is at least partly genetically determined. We have analysed the prevalence of \u2212238 G/A and \u2212308 G/A polymorphisms in the regulatory region of the TNF\u03b1 gene promoter in CVD. Patients and methods : Genotypic analyses were performed on 308 consecutive unrelated patients diagnosed with ischemic CVD, 147 women and 161 men, mean age 70\u00b10.8 years, who were diagnosed according to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment. All included cases were age and sex matched to a control from the same geographic area who had no history of vascular disease. Patients and controls completed a questionnaires including blood pressure, diabetes status, total serum cholesterol level and smoking history. The TNF\u03b1 variants were detected by PCR using primers containing a single base-pair mismatch to introduce a restriction site into the wild-type nucleotide sequences after amplification. PCR products were digested with NcoI and MspI to detect \u2212308 and \u2212238 variants, respectively. The strength of the association of the polymorphisms with the occurrence of CVD was estimated by calculation of the OR and its 95%CI by exact method. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Logistic regression analysis was applied to estimate the risk in a multivariable predictive model with dependent variable (case/control) and all independent variables significant in the bivariate analysis. SPSS 9.0 was used for the statistical analysis. Results: Genotype analysis showed a significant higher prevalence of the G/A and A/A genotypes of \u2212238 G/A TNF\u03b1 in patients (p< 0.01;OR= 2.16;95%CI= 1.40\u20133.34). The prevalence of the A allele was also significantly increased in the group of CVD patients than in the controls (13.6% vs 7.0%; p<0.01;OR=2.10;95%CI=1.40\u20133.17). By contrast, the distribution of \u2212308 genotypes for patients did not differ from their control group (84.9% vs 81.1% and 14.4% vs 16.9%, respectively; p=0.21;OR=0.76;95%CI=0.48\u20131.20) or in the A allele frequencies (7.9% vs 10.4%; p=0.12;OR=0.73;95%CI=0.48\u20131.11). When analysis was performed for the two more frequently subtypes of CVD, atherotrombotic subtype showed an higher prevalence of the A allele of -238 G/A polymorphism, as compared with the undetermined etiology (16.5% vs 11.2%;p=0.06;OR=1.86;95%CI= 0.91\u20133.82). By contrast, the variant \u2212308 G/A did not differ from the different subtypes. Logistic regression analysis showed a independent association of A haplotype of \u2212238 G/A TNF\u03b1 with CVD. Also hypertension, diabetes mellitus and current smoking status were statistically associated with CVD. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the A allele of \u2212238 G/A TNF\u03b1 promoter polymorphism is a genetic risk factor for ischemic CVD in Spanish population. Data on the distribution of genotypes and corresponding allelic frequencies of \u2212238 G/A and \u2212308 G/A TNF\u03b1 polymorphisms in CVD are scant. The present study is the first to analyses these variants in CVD patients from this geographic area.",
