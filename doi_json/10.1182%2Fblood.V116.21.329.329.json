    "abstract_text": "Abstract 329 Activated protein C (APC) has anti-coagulant and cytoprotective effects. Recently we have shown that APC protects against diabetic nephropathy by inhibiting endothelial and podocyte apoptosis. The cytoprotecive effects of APC in endothelial cells require endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) and protease activated recetor-1 (PAR-1). However, the signalling mechanism through which APC exerts its cytoprotective effects in podocytes is not known. Here we have used a mouse model of LPS-mediated podocyte injury and show that APC protects against LPS induced podocyte apoptosis and proteinuria. These cytoprotective effects of APC require activation of PAR-3. Supplementary in vitro experiments were performed using immortalized differentiated human and mouse podocytes to delineate the receptor mechanism. LPS administration (200 \u03bcg/mice, i.p.) induced podocyte apoptosis, foot process effacement and albuminuria by 24h. Administration of APC (20 \u03bcg/ mice, i.v, 6 h after LPS injection) protected against podocyte apoptosis, foot process effacement and albuminuria. Pre-incubation of APC with HAAPC antibody which blocks the anticoagulant, but not the cytoprotective properties of APC did not abolish the cytoprotective effect, establishing that the protective effect of APC is independent of its anticoagulant property. To demonstrate the direct cytoprotective effect of APC on podocytes, FITC labelled APC was administered i.v. Within 3 min FITC-APC accumulated in the pericapillary space of mouse glomeruli. In addition significantly elevated levels of PC were detected in urine samples of LPS treated mice as well as of diabetic patients or mice. These results suggest that APC transverses the glomerular filtration barrier, thus being able to directly modulate podocyte signalling in vivo . Furthermore experiments with PAR-3 -/- mice, EPCR deficient (EPCR d/d ) mice or PAR-1 antagonist (pepducin PI pal12S) showed that the cytoprotective effect of APC in podocytes is independent of EPCR but requires PAR-3 and PAR-1. In vitro APC (2 nM) inhibited puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) induced podocyte apoptosis. These anti-apoptotic effect of APC require limited proteolysis of PAR-3 and cross-activation of either PAR-1 (mouse, rat podocytes) or PAR-2 (human podocytes). In addition, ectopic expression of PAR-3 in mesangial cells which lack PAR-3 is sufficient to render these cells APC sensitive and inhibit staurosporine induced apoptosis. In conclusion, we demonstrate a novel cyto-protective mechamism of APC in an acute model of nephropathy, which depends on APC mediated limited proteolysis of PAR-3. This novel podocyte protective signalling pathway may lay ground to the delineation of new pathophysiological concepts and therapeutic approaches.
