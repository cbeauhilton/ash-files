    "abstract_text": "Immune cells show quick responses to infection. Many studies concerning cellular and humoral immunity have focused on the regulation of mature lymphocyte function. However, recent studies revealed that the early stage of hematopoiesis plays an important role in the immune system. In bone marrow, hematopoietic stem/ progenitors (HSPC) are targets of pathogen products and danger signals. After the exposure to Gram-negative lipopolysaccharide, the ligand of Toll-like receptor 4, hematopoietic stem cells enter cell-cycle and differentiate into myeloid lineage cells while B lymphopoiesis almost arrests. Little has been known how early T lymphopoiesis in thymus changes. Previously, we cloned signal-transducing adaptor protein-2 (STAP-2) as a c-fms/M-CSFR interacting protein, and found STAP-2 in T lymphocytes or macrophages is crucial for immune responses. The function of STAP-2 is generally recognized under inflammatory condition, interacting with a variety of signaling or transcriptional molecules. We reported that STAP-2 binds to STAT5 for regulation of T cell proliferation, and in macrophages, STAP-2 combines with MyD88 and I\u03baB kinase to activate NF-\u03baB and enhances the production of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1. In this study, the effects of STAP-2 on early T progenitors were evaluated using gene-modified mice. All experimental procedures were conducted under specific pathogen-free conditions, according to protocols approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Osaka University. We first evaluated the expression level of STAP-2 in murine thymus with quantitative PCR. STAP-2 mRNA was ubiquitously observed all through T cell development, including the CD4 - CD8 - double-negative (DN) stage. To test the influences on T lymphopoiesis, we generated knock-out and transgenic mice (Tg) that are modified STAP-2 gene expression. In Tg mice, STAP-2 was overexpressed under the control of the Lck proximal promoter. The promoter could drive expression of the inserted cDNA in T lineage cells from the late of DN 2 stage (CD44 + CD25 + ). We found that thymus was significantly enlarged in Tg mice (46.7 \u00b1 11.15 mg in WT vs 88.1 \u00b1 25.2 mg in Tg), while the number of T lymphocytes in periphery was comparable to wild-type mice (WT). Results from flow cytometric analysis showed STAP-2 enhanced the percentages of DN2 and DN3 (CD44 - CD25 + ) T progenitors, and the actual numbers of DN2, DN3, DN4 (CD44 - CD25 - ) and CD4 + CD8 + double-positive subpopulations. There were no differences between control and knock-out mice in thymus and peripheral bloods. When Lin - Sca1 + cKit High HSPC derived from Tg mice were cultured with Delta-like 1-transduced OP9 stromal cells (OP9-DL1) under T cell generation condition, the development of DN4 cells was accelerated (26.9 \u00b1 6.2 % in WT vs 35.2 \u00b1 4.1 % in Tg). Co-cultures from Lin - CD44 + CD25 - cKit High early T cell progenitors showed the same tendency. These results indicate that STAP-2 regulates the proliferation and differentiation of T progenitors during DN3 to DN4 stage. To elucidate the signaling regulated by STAP-2, microarray experiment with DN3 T progenitors was conducted. The bioinformative approach with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed the canonical pathways related with IL-12 signaling, 4-1BB (CD137) signaling and helper T cell differentiation were significantly influenced. Interestingly, we found that STAP-2 affected the distribution of functional T lymphocytes. The ratio of helper CD4 + cells to suppressor CD8 + cells in peripheral bloods was lower in Tg mice than that in WT. In summary, we found that STAP-2 regulates the early T lymphopoiesis in thymus. DN2 to DN4 stages of T progenitors increased in STAP-2 transgenic mice, and STAP-2 promoted the differentiation in vitro. Moreover, STAP-2 affected the cell decision in development to helper CD4 + cells or suppressor CD8 + cells. Our study indicates the up-regulation of STAP-2 under inflammatory condition might be crucial for immune response at the early stage of T lymphopoiesis. Further study would clarify the precise molecular mechanisms of the enhancement of T lymphopoiesis by STAP-2. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
