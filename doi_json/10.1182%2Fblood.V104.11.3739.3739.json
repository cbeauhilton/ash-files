    "abstract_text": "Three new Hb variants were found in four blood donors, which we named Hb Itapira [\u03b130(B11) Glu\u2192Val)], Hb Bom Jesus da Lapa [\u03b130(B11) Glu\u2192Ala)] and Hb Boa Esperanc\u0327a [\u03b116 (A14) Lis\u2192Thr], according to their carriers\u2019 origin. The first one was detected in a Caucasian man from Southeastern Brazil; electrophoresis at alkaline pH showed a low proportion Hb S-like band (5,5%), which was not distinguished from Hb A at acidic pH. High performance liquid chromatography-HPLC exhibited a short peak at D-Window. The abnormal \u03b1-globin was demonstrated by globin-chain electrophoresis at acid pH, with a slower migration than the normal \u03b1-chain. The \u03b1 genes were sequenced (ABI PRISM-377-DNA automated sequencer, Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) and a base substitution found at the 30th codon of the \u03b11-gene (GAG\u2192GTG), in heterozygosis, causing Glu\u2192Val replacement in the \u03b1-chain. Familial analysis revealed that the carrier\u2019s mother and brother have the same alteration. All the affected members of this family are also heterozygous for the \u03b1-globin gene triplication (\u03b1\u03b1\u03b1anti3.7), explaining the low percentage of the variant and suggesting an association of the mutation with the triplicate haplotype. Hb Bom Jesus da Lapa results of a mutation at the same gene and position: \u03b11, 30th codon (GAG\u2192GCG), causing Glu\u2192Ala replacement. It was detected in an African descendant woman from the northeastern region of Brazil; the electrophoretic behaviour was similar to that of Hb Itapira, but it eluted with Hb A2 on HPLC, in a total of 24.8%, and the mutant did not separate from normal \u03b1-chain at the acidic globin electrophoresis. Two other variants with replacement of the \u03b1-chain 30th residue have been described [Hb O-Padova (Glu\u2192Lys), found in Italian, Turkish and Spanish families, and Hb G-Chinese (or G-Honolulu, G-Hong Kong, G-Singapore) (Glu\u2192Gln), encountered in Chinese families], none of them with clinical or hematological manifestations although this residue is involved in the \u03b1l\u03b21 contacts of the molecule. Hb Boa Esperanc\u0327a was detected in two apparently not-related individuals, one of them of African descent, both originate from the state of Minas Gerais, Southeast Brazil. This variant moved faster than Hb A at alkaline pH, was not distinguished at acid pH, and eluted as an additional peak at P3 on HPLC (25%); globin-chain electrophoresis showed a slower \u03b1-chain. Sequencing revealed a base substitution at the 16th codon of the \u03b12-gene, in heterozygosis (AAG\u2192ACG; Lys\u2192Thr). Although the carriers have different surnames and do not know each other, \u03b2-cluster haplotypes are suggestive of a common ancestor. Three other mutations have already been described in this position [Hb I (Lys\u2192Glu), Hb Beijing (Lys\u2192Asn), in asymptomatic heterozigotes, and Hb Harbin (Lys\u2192Met), slightly unstable, resulting in anemia to its carrier. All the three variants described here showed normal instability and solubility tests."
