    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2168 Several members of the protein disulfide isomerase family of enzymes are important in platelet function and in thrombosis. Platelet protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) has been shown to have an important role in platelet function but is reported to not be required for thrombus formation in vivo. A novel platelet PDI called ERp57 mediates platelet aggregation but its role in thrombus formation is unknown. To determine the specific role of platelet-derived ERp57 in hemostasis and thrombosis we generated a megakaryocyte/platelet specific knockout. Despite normal platelet counts and platelet glycoprotein expression, mice with ERp57-deficient platelets had prolonged tail-bleeding times and thrombus occlusion times, and defective activation of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin and platelet aggregation. The aggregation defect was corrected by addition of exogenous ERp57 implicating surface ERp57 in platelet aggregation. Platelet surface ERp57 protein and activity increased substantially with platelet activation. We conclude that platelet-derived ERp57 is required for hemostasis and thrombosis and platelet function.
