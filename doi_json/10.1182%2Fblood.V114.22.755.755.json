    "abstract_text": "Abstract 755 Background: TG101348 is a potent, orally bioavailable, JAK2-selective small molecule inhibitor, that is currently being evaluated in a Phase I study for the treatment of myelofibrosis. Data from the dose escalation cohort (n=28; 30-800mg administered as a single daily dose) showed dose-linear plasma exposure, with mean elimination T 1/2 at steady state ranging from 20 to 52 hours. The dose-limiting toxicity was asymptomatic grade 3 or 4 amylasemia/lipasemia that was reversible, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 680mg. The most frequent non-hematological toxicities were mild nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea that were easily controlled or resolved spontaneously. Grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 14% and 25% of patients, respectively. TG101348 had activity in reducing spleen size, leukocyte count, and JAK2V617F (VF) allele burden. Here, we present updated results with a focus on data from the dose confirmation cohort who initiated treatment at a dose of 680mg/day. Results: Fifty nine patients (median age=66 years; range 43-86) have been treated \u2013 28 in the dose escalation phase, and 31 in the dose confirmation phase. Overall, 44 patients had PMF, 12 post-PV MF, and 3 post-ET MF; 86% were VF-positive. Median palpable spleen size was 18cm and 22 patients were RBC transfusion-requiring at study enrollment. After a median follow-up of 12 weeks (range <1-76), 18 (31%) patients have discontinued treatment due to toxicity (n=7; thrombocytopenia=3, neutropenia=1), comorbidities (n=5), withdrawal of consent (n=4), or non-compliance/lack of response (1 each). The remaining 41 patients are currently at the following dose levels: 680mg (n=14), 520-600mg (n=16), 360-440mg (n=10), and 240mg (n=1). The cumulative drug exposure to date is 362 patient-months; exposure at or above MTD (\u2265680mg) is 154 patient-months. Forty patients (68%) started treatment at \u2265680mg. Toxicity: TG101348 is well tolerated. Of the patients who started at \u2265680mg, Gr3/4 neutropenia was observed in 15/0% and Gr3/4 thrombocytopenia in 20/10%. Twenty four (60%) patients did not require RBC transfusions at baseline (median Hgb=9.6g/dL; range 7.4-13.1); of these, 42% and 8% of patients developed Gr3 and Gr4 anemia, respectively. The majority of patients who started at \u2265680mg developed mild nausea (1 Gr3), vomiting (1 Gr3), and/or diarrhea (3 Gr3) that were self-limited or easily controlled. Other non-hematological toxicities included Gr1/2 transaminitis (38%), Gr1/2 serum creatinine elevation (38%), and asymptomatic hyperlipasemia (33%). Efficacy: Thirty three patients who started at \u2265680mg have completed at least 3 cycles of treatment; at 3 months, reduction in palpable spleen size (baseline median=18cms; range 6-32) was at least 50% in 22 (67%) patients; the spleen became non-palpable in 9 (27%) patients. All 21 patients with leukocytosis at baseline (WBC range 11 to 203 \u00d710 9 /L) who started at \u2265680mg have experienced a marked reduction in their WBC count (range 4 to 90); 70% had a normal WBC count at their last follow-up visit. Overall, 48 of the 51 VF-positive patients completed at least 1 cycle and were evaluable for response in VF allele burden; at last available follow-up, the median decrease in granulocyte mutant allele burden was 48%; 21 (44%) patients have had a \u226550% reduction, and in the group who started treatment at \u2265680mg, 48% have had a \u226550% reduction. Of those evaluable, there was clinically significant benefit or resolution of constitutional symptoms, including early satiety, fatigue, cough, pruritus, and night sweats. Conclusions: TG101348 continues to be well tolerated in patients with myelofibrosis. Spleen and leukocyte responses are frequent, observed early, and produce substantial clinical benefit for patients. These responses are associated with significant decrease in VF allele burden and point to activity of TG101348 against the malignant clone in myelofibrosis.
