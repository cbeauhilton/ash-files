    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4981 Objective: To investigate the expression of bone marrow CD38+CD138+, CD38+CD138-plasma cells and the expression of Notch1 on the membrane of them in the patients with multiple myeloma(MM), and explore the importance of Notch signaling pathway in the formation and progression of MM further. Methods: Thirty-three MM patients and 15 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. The expression of bone marrow CD38+CD138+, CD38+CD138-plasma cells and the expression of Notch1 on the membrane of them were analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of Notch1 mRNA of bone marrow mononuclear cells were analyzed by RT-PCR. Results: The ratio of CD38+CD138+ plasma cells from 24 newly diagnosed MM patients was (51. 50%\u00b112. 48%) which was significantly higher than CD38+CD138- plasma cells of MM patients (42. 88%\u00b111. 41%)(P=0. 016)and controls 20. 13%\u00b15. 8(P=0. 000). The expression of CD38+CD138+ plasma cells from 24 newly diagnosed MM patients was correlated to the level of malignant plasma cells in there bone marrow(r=0. 546, p=0. 006), serum level of lactate dehydrogenase(LDH)(r=0. 567, p=0. 004), and \u03b22-MG(r=0. 431, p=0. 035). The ratio of Notch1 on the membrane of CD38+CD138+ plasma cells of MM patients was (60. 21%\u00b125. 06%) which was significantly higher than those of CD38+CD138- plasma cells of MM patients 39. 84%\u00b118. 94%(P=0. 000)and controls (38. 34%\u00b119. 39%)(P=0. 004). There was no statistical difference between the two latter groups(P>0. 05). The expression of Notch1 on CD38+CD138+ plasma cells from 24 newly diagnosed MM patients was correlated to the level of malignant plasma cells in there brone marrow(r=0. 914, p=0. 000), serum level of lactate dehydrogenase(LDH) (r=0. 604, p=0. 002), and \u03b22-MG(r=0. 455, p=0. 026). The ratio of Notch1 on the membrane of CD38+CD138+ plasma cells of MM patients who had renal dysfunction was correlated to their abnormal serum creatinine levels. The expression of Notch1 on CD38+CD138+ plasma cells from 17 MM patients who received VD chemotherapy was correlated to the ratio of plasma cell reduction after the first VD chemotherapy(r=0. 842, p=0. 000). The expression of Notch1 mRNA of bone marrow mononuclear from 10 MM patients was (0. 8252\u00b10. 4079) which was significantly higher than those of controls (0. 3759\u00b10. 0813)(p=0. 032). Conclusion: Notch1 over expressed on CD38+CD138+ plasma cells with relation to the effects of early VD therapy and long term outcome of MM.
