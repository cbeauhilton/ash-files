    "abstract_text": "Background The median age of AML is approximately 70 years, and the survival of older adults age \u226560 years remains poor with standard therapy. Clofarabine (CLO) has significant single agent activity in AML, and in vitro studies demonstrate synergy with Ara-C. We therefore performed a phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CLO with standard dose Ara-C (100mg/m 2 /day D1-7 by 24hr continuous infusion) as AML induction therapy. CLO was administered daily \u00d7 5 days beginning D2 to allow for pharmacokinetic (PK) & pharmacodynamic (PD) studies. Methods Enrollment was restricted to newly-diagnosed de novo AML patients age \u226560 years considered candidates for intensive therapy; those with prior MDS or hypoplastic AML (<20% bone marrow cellularity) were excluded. Pts were treated in cohorts of 3\u20136 to determine MTD of CLO with standard dose infusional Ara-C (100mg/m 2 \u00d7 7). DLT was defined as grade III/IV non-hematologic toxicity occurring in >1 pt per cohort. The CLO starting dose was 30mg/m 2 /day \u00d75 (dose level 1), with the intention to increase to CLO 40mg/m 2 if tolerated. However, CLO dose reductions of 25% (CLO 22.5 mg/m 2 /day \u00d7 5, dose level -1) & 50% (CLO 15mg/m 2 /day \u00d75, dose level -2) were allowed in the event of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Pts achieving complete remission (CR) received 2 cycles consolidation with CLO \u00d75 & Ara-C 100mg/m 2 \u00d7 5. Results A total of 13 pts (median age 69 yrs, range 61\u201377; 10 male) have been treated. DLT was observed at dose level 1 (Table 1), and the protocol was amended to mandate additional hydration with CLO, and antibiotic/antifungal prophylaxis. At dose level -1, 1 pt died from PE on D27 after hematologic recovery, considered treatment-related per protocol, mandating dose de-escalation to dose level -2. Pt 13 is in active induction therapy, and not yet evaluable for response, although DLT has not been encountered. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 11/13 pts. The MTD in this study is CLO 15mg/m 2 /day \u00d7 5 with standard infusional Ara-C (dose level -2). Significant clinical activity was observed, particularly at higher CLO doses, including CR in 2 pts with complex karyotype. In contrast, only 1/5 evaluable pts at dose level-2 achieved CR. PK & PD studies are in progress. Conclusions In contrast to prior reports using intermediate dose bolus Ara-C (1g/m 2 ), the MTD of CLO combined with standard dose infusional Ara-C in older adults with AML is lower, and the toxicity profile appears different. Significant clinical activity was noted at higher CLO dose levels & with complex karyotype. Based on this observation an escalation to CLO 20mg/m 2 is now planned.
