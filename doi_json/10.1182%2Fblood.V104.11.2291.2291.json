    "abstract_text": "Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinemia is a serious and frequently fatal illness, however many of the mechanisms leading to this disease are not yet known. It is clear, however, that there is dysregulation of the balance between cell proliferation and programmed cell death. BLyS (B-lymphocyte stimulator) is a newly identified TNF family member expressed by monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. BLyS has been shown to be critical for maintenance of normal B cell development and homeostasis, and has been found to stimulate lymphocyte growth. BLyS is overexpressed in a variety of B-cell malignancies and has been shown to inhibit apoptosis in malignant B-cells. Studies of the effects of BLyS on B cell physiology have shown that it also regulates immunoglobulin secretion. To determine the relevance of the BLyS receptor-ligand system in Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinemia, we examined malignant B cells from 5 patients with Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinemia for their ability to bind soluble BLyS and for the expression of the known BLyS receptors, TACI, BAFF-R, or BCMA. The malignant B cells were found to bind BLyS and express BAFF-R and TACI. BCMA expression was undetectable. We then determined the expression of BLyS in bone marrow specimens from 5 patients with Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinemia by immunohistochemistry and compared it to the expression in 5 normal bone marrow specimens. The lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltrate in the bone marrow of patients with Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinemia showed significantly increased BLyS expression. We further determined the serum BLyS levels by ELISA in stored serum specimens from patients with Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinemia (n=20), and compared them to serum BLyS levels in other patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma without elevated immunoglobulin levels (n=10) and to serum levels in normal controls (n=50). Serum BLyS levels in Waldenstrom\u2019s patients (mean: 49.6ng/ml) as well as those in patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (mean; 46.7ng/ml) were significantly higher than normal controls (mean 12.6ng/ml). In conclusion, we have demonstrated that malignant B cells from patients with Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinemia express the receptors for BLyS and can bind soluble BLyS. Furthermore, we have found that serum BLyS levels are significantly elevated in patients with Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinemia when compared to controls. Strategies to inhibit BLyS may potentially have significant therapeutic efficacy in Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinemia.",
