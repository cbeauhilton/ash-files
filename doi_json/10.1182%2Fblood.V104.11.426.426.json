    "abstract_text": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT), especially in older patients. We previously showed that host-reactive donor T cells are selectively depleted (SD) from an allograft ex vivo, following a short co-culture of donor cells with irradiated T cell stimulators from the recipient and subsequent treatment with an anti-CD25 immunotoxin. We report a pilot study to test the hypothesis that GVHD could be decreased in a cohort of elderly patients receiving SD allografts from HLA-identical sibling donors. Sixteen patients, median age 65 years (range 51\u201373), with advanced hematologic malignancies were transplanted following reduced-intensity conditioning with fludarabine and either cyclophosphamide (n=5), melphalan (n=5), or busulfan (n=6). Cyclosporine was used as the only additional GVHD prophylaxis. SD allografts contained a median CD34 dose of 4.5x10 6 /kg (range 3.5\u20137.3) and an SD CD3 dose of 1.0x10 8 /kg (range 0.2\u20131.5). Fifteen patients achieved sustained engraftment. The helper T lymphocyte precursor (HTLp) frequency assay demonstrated depletion of host-reactive donor T cells in 9/11 cases tested from a mean of 1/182,089 to 1/822,354 (mean 5.5-fold depletion), while third party responses were conserved. Kaplan-Meier estimates of probability of grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute GVHD were lower than those seen in a historical control group of patients receiving cyclosporine alone for GVHD prophylaxis (35\u00b113% vs. 57\u00b110%, p=0.34) and (7\u00b16% vs. 38\u00b16%, p=0.05), respectively. Of note, the two patients who developed visceral (gut \u00b1 liver) GVHD showed ineffective allodepletion by HTLp (figure). Chronic GVHD occurred in five of 14 evaluable patients. At a median follow-up of 212 days (range 60 \u2013 690), seven of sixteen patients remain alive and in remission. Relapse deaths occurred in four patients (refractory AML [2], therapy-related MDS [1], and CMML [1]). Non-relapse mortality in this high-risk cohort of patients included graft failure [1], GVHD [2], infection [1], and myocardial infarction [1]. In summary, CD25-directed allodepletion of stem cell allografts can reduce clinically relevant acute GVHD following matched related donor transplantation.
