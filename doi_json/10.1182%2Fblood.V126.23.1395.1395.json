    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous and aggressive malignant disease characterized by poor patient outcome and suboptimal front-line chemotherapy. To identify novel anti-AML compounds and potential molecular markers that confer drug-specificity, we performed a high-throughput screen of an in-house library consisting only of food-derived bioactive molecules (n=300). This screen was performed against the AML cell line (TEX), which has several properties of leukemia stem cells, the cells responsible for disease pathophysiology and patient relapse. This screen identified diosmetin as a novel anti-leukemia agent (IC50: 6.8 \u00b1 1.7\u00b5m). Diosmetin (10\u00b5M) reduced clonogenic growth of primary AML patient cells with no effect on normal hematopoetic stem cells. In leukemia mouse xenografts, administration of diosmetin (50mg/kg) reduced tumor weight (>40%) without evidence of toxicity. Collectively, this shows that diosmetin is a novel anti-AML agent. Diosmetin-induced apoptosis (e.g., increased Annexin V staining and DNA fragmentation) was abolished in the presence of caspase-inhibitors. Importantly, diosmetin, which is a flavonoid and a known ROS-inducer, induced death in the presence of anti-oxidants demonstrating that death was not related to ROS activity. Instead, we demonstrate that diosmetin-induced caspase 8-, not caspase 9, mediated apoptosis that was facilitated by increased TNF-\u03b1. To identify diosmetin's molecular target we employed a novel method utilizing several free-online bioinformatics tools. Here, the protein data base (PBD), Pocket Similarity Search using Multi-Sketches (PoSSuM) and Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) tool, were used sequentially to identify potential diosmetin binding partners. This method identified the estrogen receptor (ER) as a potential molecular target for diosmetin's anti-leukemia activity. There are two types of ERs. When activated, ER\u03b1 increases cell proliferation whereas ER\u03b2 inhibits proliferation. These opposite and opposing roles have led to the hypothesis that ER expression patterns dictate the cell's response to estrogen, as hormones like estradiol can bind to both ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 with different affinities. To first determine to which ER diosmetin bound, we mapped the binding sites of both ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 using the Discovery Studio (DS), Structure-Based-Design program and determined the relative affinity of diosmetin to these ERs. Diosmetin bound with far greater affinity to ER\u03b2 than ER\u03b1. Next, we interrogated publically available AML patient datasets to determine the expression pattern of ER\u03b1 versus ER\u03b2. Interestingly, we noted a subset of AML patients that upregulate ER\u03b2 but not ER\u03b1 expression (log4 fold increase; p<0.001) suggesting the clinical relevance of targeting ER\u03b2 in a subset of AML patients. To assess the cell and molecular role of ERs, we measured ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 levels in diosmetin sensitive and insensitive cell lines. Interestingly, diosmetin sensitive cell lines (TEX, LP1, AML2) display significantly elevated ER-\u03b2 protein and mRNA levels (4 fold, as determined by Western blotting and qtPCR, respectively) compared to diosmetin insensitive cell lines (K562, DU145). This pattern was not observed for ER-\u03b1. Furthermore, this ER expression pattern was also observed in primary AML cells; as AML cells sensitive to diosmetin displayed an increase in ER\u03b2, but not ER\u03b1, mRNA. Finally, ER reporter assays demonstrated that diosmetin binds and acts as a partial agonist in ER\u03b2 but not ER\u03b1 reporter cells. Together, these results show that diosmetin binds to ER\u03b2 and that ER\u03b2 is functionally important to diosmetin's activity. In summary, these studies highlight ER\u03b2 as a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of AML. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
