    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4188 The frequency of minor blood group antigens has not been described among Hispanic blood donors. A retrospective cohort study was performed using the South Texas Blood and Tissue Center (STBTC) donor database, LifeTrak. Blood donors self-identified race and ethnicity. Caucasian and Hispanic donors were eligible. Donors who did not have minor antigen testing performed were not included. The STBTC has a high proportion of Hispanic blood donors (299047/779409, 38%), who are primarily of Mexican ancestry. Minor antigen testing was performed in 10% (74140/779409) of all donors; 8% (25394/299407) of Hispanic donors and 11% (42891/392074) of Caucasian donors. Hispanic donors were significantly more like to express blood type O Rh+ than Caucasian donors (13920/25394, 55% v 14947/74140, 35%; p<0.001). The frequency of ABO and RhD blood groups were similar to those reported previously in Caucasian and Hispanic donors (Garraty, et al. Transfusion, 2004). Of the minor antigens, expression of Rh E also differed significantly between Hispanic and Caucasian donors (4706/11744, 40% v 5416/19497, 28%; p<0.001). The prevalence of the other minor antigens were more similar and are reported in Figure 1. Complete Rh haplotypes were available in 8296 Caucasian donors and 7176 Hispanic donors. The haplotype RhDce differed significantly in 36% of Caucasians and 50% of Hispanics (3022/8296 v 3589/7176). The haplotype RhDce was previously reported as most common in African-Americans at 44% (Avent, et al. Blood, 2000). Haplotype RhDCE was found in 8% of Caucasians and 10% of Hispanics (660/8296 v 643/7176); haplotype RhDcE in 16% of Caucasians and 15% of Hispanics (1354/8296 v 1041/7176); and haplotype RhDCe was found in 39% of Caucasians and 27% of Hispanics (3260/8296 v 1903/7176). Differences exist in the frequency of minor blood group antigens among Caucasian and Hispanic blood donors in Southwest Texas.
