    "abstract_text": "Background CD20 is selectively expressed on the surface of early pre-B-cells, remains throughout B-cell development, and is then lost from plasma cells. Because CD20 is present on the majority of B-cell lymphomas, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (MAb) therapy is widely employed in the treatment of NHL. However a majority of NHL patients eventually become refractory to CD20 MAb(s). Resistance mechanisms may include increased MAb catabolism, initial or post treatment selection of low CD20 expressing tumor cells, trogocytosis of surface CD20, failure of MAb effector mechanisms and/or impaired patient immune cell function. MT-3724 is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of a CD20 binding variable fragment (scFv) fused to the enzymatically active Shiga-like toxin-I A1 subunit (SLT-I A1). SLT-I A1 is an N-glycosidase that catalytically inactivates 60S ribosomal subunits causing inhibition of protein synthesis. Upon its scFv binding to cell surface CD20 in vitro, SLT-I A1 forces MT-3724 internalization which then routes in a predictable fashion to the cytosol and irreversibly inactivates the cell ribosomes triggering cell death. MT-3724 has been shown to specifically bind and kill CD20+ malignant human B-cells in vitro and non-human primate (NHP) B-cells in vivo . MT-3724 was tested for safety in healthy NHPs: 6 intravenous (IV) doses of MT-3724 were given over 12 days at doses of 50, 150, and 450 mcg/kg. There were no deaths or effects on serum chemistries in the NHP studies. The major observed toxicity (inappetence) resolved within 48 hours of last dose. There was a significant, dose-dependent NHP B-cell depletion by Day 3 at all doses. Given the preclinical activity and mechanism of action, a Phase I/Ib study of MT-3724 was initiated in NHL. Methods MT-3724 is being tested for safety and tolerability in a first-in-human, open label, ascending dose study (3 + 3 design) in sequential cohorts of 5, 10, 20 and 50 mcg/kg/dose. Eligible subjects who previously responded to a CD20 MAb containing therapy followed by relapse/recurrence of NHL receive 6 doses by 2 hour IV infusions over the first 12 days of a 28 day cycle (first cycle). With continued safety, tolerability and lack of tumor progression, subjects may receive up to 4 additional 6-dose cycles (21 days) with tumor assessments after cycles 2, 4 and 5. Dose escalation is based on < 33% dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed during the first 28 day cycle. Results Three NHL subjects (2 transformed DLBCL, 1 FL) have completed at least one cycle in the 5 mcg/kg/dose cohort with no protocol DLTs or infusion related reactions and are evaluable for safety. Non-DLTs included grade (Gr) 2-3 transient hyperglycemic episodes related to pre-infusion corticosteroid therapy (n=1); transient Gr 4 neutropenia, possibly related to MT-3724 during cycle 1, week 4 (n=1); Gr 4 hypercalcemia and acute kidney injury with Gr 3 hypophosphatemia during cycle 1, week 4 due to leukemic disease progression (n=1). Subject 1 completed 5 cycles of therapy, with a partial response achieved post cycle 2 sustained through cycle 5; Subject 3 had a mixed response (both subjects had transformed DLBCL). Three subjects have now initiated treatment in the 10 mcg/kg/dose cohort with updated data to be presented at the meeting. Conclusions MT-3724 at 5 mcg/kg/dose has been safely administered for up to 5 cycles in this first-in-human study in relapsed/refractory NHL subjects. Treatment with the 10 mcg/kg cohort has commenced with continuing dose ascension planned. There is early evidence of clinical activity.
