    "abstract_text": "Background The prognosis for AML or MDS patients (pts) with monosomal karyotype (MK) is dismal. Although a benefit for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) compared to chemotherapy or autologous HCT has been demonstrated in young (\u2264 60) pts (Cornelissen, 2012), the curative potential of allo-HCT in older (\u2265 60) pts with monosomal karyotype AML/MDS is not known. Patients and methods In this retrospective review, we analyzed outcomes for 69 AML (n = 49) or MDS (n = 20) pts \u2265 60 who underwent allo-HCT at Mayo Clinic Arizona between 2005 and 2013, based on cytogenetic grouping as follows: cytogenetically normal (CN, n = 23), cytogenetically abnormal but not MK (CA, n = 32), and MK (n = 14). Monosomal karyotype was defined (Breems, 2008) as a karyotype with at least two autosomal monosomies or a single autosomal monosomy in combination with at least one structural abnormality. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of these 3 cytogenetic groupings on outcome (primary endpoint progression-free survival). The median age for all pts was 66 (60-76), and median follow-up for surviving pts was 22 months (range 70 days \u2013 7.1 years). Thirty-seven pts had high-risk disease (MDS > 5% blasts or AML not in CR), while 32 were considered standard risk (MDS <5% blasts or AML in CR). The majority of pts had good performance status (KPS \u2265 90% in 66), but 34 pts (49%) had an HCT-CI score of \u2265 3. Conditioning was myeloablative (Bu-Cy) in 4, reduced toxicity FBM (Fludarabine, BCNU, Melphalan) in 36, and RIC/NMA in 29. Donors were matched related in 18, matched unrelated in 36, and mismatched unrelated in 15. GVHD prophylaxis included tacrolimus in all pts combined with mycophenolate mofetil (37) or methotrexate (32); 49 pts received in-vivo T-cell depletion with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG, Thymoglobulin, Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). Results The Kaplan-Meier estimate of progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 yrs was 59% (CN), 39% (CA), and 1.5% (MK); P = 0.004 ( Fig. 1 ). The cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 yrs (with death without relapse as a competing risk) was 34% (CN), 25% (CA), and 94% (MK); P = 0.009). In a Cox proportional hazards analysis adjusted for age (\u2264 66 vs. > 66), risk status (standard vs. high), conditioning (myeloablative [Bu-Cy + FBM] vs. RIC/NMA), use of ATG (yes/no), donor type (unrelated vs. related), and HCT-CI (0-2 vs. \u2265 3), the only factor predictive for inferior PFS was cytogenetic status (MK vs. CN, HR 4.64 [95% CI, 1.7 \u2013 13]; P = 0.003); (MK vs. CA, HR 2.4 [95% CI 0.97 \u2013 5.9]; P = .057).

Although larger studies will be required to confirm our results, novel transplant approaches or post-transplant strategies to prevent relapse should be a focus of future studies in this incurable pt population.
