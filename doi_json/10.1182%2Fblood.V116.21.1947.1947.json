    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1947 The introduction of novel agents and improvements in supportive care over the last years resulted in a significant improvement of the overall survival (OS) of myeloma patients (Brenner et al Blood 2008, Kumar et al Blood 2008, Kastritis et al Leukemia 2009). However, these retrospective studies indicated that this survival benefit was more pronounced in younger patients while in older patients there was only a marginal improvement in outcome. Randomized studies have shown that upfront use of thalidomide with melphalan and prednisone (MPT) offers superior progression free survival (PFS) than MP alone, and in some of these studies there was also a survival advantage. Bortezomib with MP was also superior to MP in a randomized study, both in terms of PFS and OS. However, these studies included selected patients that may not be representative of the general population of elderly patients with myeloma. Thus, we analyzed our database in order to assess the effect of the upfront use of novel agents (thalidomide, bortezomib, lenalidomide) in consecutive patients older than 65 who were treated in a single center, in Athens, Greece. Many of these patients had been included in clinical trials; however, several patients who were ineligible because of poor performance status, significant renal impairment or comorbidities were also treated with novel agent-based regimens. Thus, these patients are more representative of the general myeloma population. We included patients who started treatment from January 1995 to January 2010, i.e patients who received similar supportive care. All patients were included in the analysis, regardless of performance status, infections, comorbidities etc. Patients were divided in two groups: those who were treated upfront with conventional regimens (group A, N=76) and those who were treated upfront with novel agent-based regimens (group B, N=115). Demographics of the two groups of patients, including gender and age were similar. Performance status at presentation was also similar among the two groups: 56% of those treated upfront with conventional agents and 57% of those treated upfront with novel agents had an ECOG performance status of 2 or higher. Thirty per cent of patients in group A and 44% of patients in group B were older than 75 years, respectively (p=0.07). The presence of osteolytic bone disease (p=0.313), anemia (Hb 75 years (HR=2, p=0.002). We conclude that in the general population of elderly patients with MM the upfront use of novel agents is associated with improved survival.
