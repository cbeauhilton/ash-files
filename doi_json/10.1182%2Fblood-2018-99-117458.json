    "abstract_text": "Background : Type 1 calreticulin ( CALR ) variants comprise ~70% of all CALR mutations in primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and form a distinct phenotypic and prognostic disease subset ( Leukemia. 2014;28:1568 ). Determinants of long-term outcome have not, however, been systematically appraised in this population. The current study documents the natural history, molecular correlates, and independent predictors of overall (OS), leukemia-free (LFS), and thrombosis-free (TFS) survival in CALR type 1/like-mutated myelofibrosis. Methods : Patients were recruited from the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. Diagnoses were consistent with World Health Organization (PMF, fibrotic/leukemic transformations) ( Blood . 2016;127:2391) and International Working Group for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment criteria (post-essential thrombocythemia (ET) MF) ( Leukemia. 2008;22:437 ). Laboratory and clinical data were retrospectively abstracted corresponding to time of referral (PMF) or myelofibrotic transformation (post-ET MF). Conventional prognostic scoring was as previously outlined ( Blood. 2010;115:1703; J Clin Oncol. 2018;36:1769 ). Recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplant were censored at the time of transplant. Standard statistical methods were used for all analyses using the JMP\u00ae Pro 13.0.0 software package (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Results : A total of 162 consecutive patients with CALR type 1/like-mutated myelofibrosis were identified: 139 (86%) with PMF and 23 (14%) with post-ET MF with median age 55 years (range 23-85), 62% male. The PMF and post-ET MF cohorts displayed similar phenotypic features with the exception of higher platelet counts (median 443 vs 340 x 10 9 /l; P =0.02) in post-ET MF (Table 1). The most frequent co-existing mutations were ASXL1 ( n =47; 37%) and SRSF2 ( n =4; 3%), with ASXL1 seen more frequently in PMF (39% vs 11% post-ET MF; P =0.07). Over a median follow-up of 6 years (range 0-25 years), a total of 20 (12%) leukemic transformations and 66 (41%) deaths were recorded, with no significant differences between the PMF and post-ET MF cohorts ( P =0.16 and 0.11, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates revealed comparably favorable median OS in both CALR type 1/like-mutated variants: not yet reached and 13 years in post-ET MF vs PMF, respectively ( P =0.7) (Figure 1A). Multivariable analysis disclosed moderate to severe sex-adjusted anemia ( P <0.001), \u22652% circulating blasts ( P <0.001), very high risk (VHR) karyotype ( P 70 years ( P =0.006), and constitutional symptoms ( P =0.008) to be independent predictors of inferior OS in CALR type 1/like-mutated PMF (Table 2). LFS was significantly shortened in the presence of IDH1 mutations ( P =0.01) and platelets <100 x 10 9 /l ( P =0.02) while IDH2 mutations ( P =0.02), leukocytosis \u226511 x 10 9 /l ( P =0.03) and history of arterial thrombosis ( P =0.04) were independent predictors of shortened TFS. Importantly, myelofibrosis variant (primary vs post-ET) did not influence survival ( P =0.7) or complication rates ( P =0.8 for LFS, P =0.09 for TFS) (Table 2). The karyotype- and mutation-enhanced international prognostic scoring system (MIPSS70+ version 2.0 ), was effective in risk stratifying type 1/like CALR -mutated PMF ( P -values 0.01 to <0.0001), with the exception of low vs intermediate ( P =0.22) and intermediate vs high risk ( P =0.49) (Figure 1C). The detrimental influences of unfavorable/VHR karyotype and ASXL1 mutations were confirmed (Figure 2A-B) while borderline adverse and prognostically neutral effects were seen on OS for U2AF1 ( n =116; P =0.05) and SRSF2 ( n =120; P =0.98) respectively (Figure 2C-D). Conclusions : The current study documents analogous disease patterns in primary and post-ET CALR type 1/like-mutated MF and provides information on determinants of long-term survival.
