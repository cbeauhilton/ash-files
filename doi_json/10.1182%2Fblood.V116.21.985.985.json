    "abstract_text": "Abstract 985 Introduction: CFZ is a novel and highly selective epoxyketone proteasome inhibitor currently in clinical development for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Ph 1 and 2 studies with CFZ have demonstrated durable single-agent antitumor activity in pts with relapsed or refractory (R/R) MM. The present study, PX-171-003-A1, was an open-label, single-arm Ph 2b trial and enrolled patients with multiply relapsed MM whose disease was refractory (defined as <25% response on, or progression during or <60 days after completion of, therapy) to their last treatment regimen. Patients must have received \u22652 prior therapies including: 1) bortezomib (BTZ) and either thalidomide (THAL) or lenalidomide (LEN), and 2) an alkylating agent. Materials and Methods: Pts received CFZ at 20 mg/m 2 on a QDx2 schedule (Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 every 28 days) in cycle (C) 1 and were dose escalated to 27 mg/m 2 on the same schedule thereafter for up to 12 C. Pts completing 12 C were eligible to enter an extension study (PX-171-010). The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) (\u2265 partial response [PR]). Secondary endpoints included: clinical benefit response (CBR) (ORR + Minimal response [MR]), duration of response for \u2265PR (DOR), overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP), progression free survival (PFS), and safety. Responses and progression were determined according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria and were assessed and confirmed by an Independent Response Committee (IRC). Results: 266 pts were enrolled with a median duration of MM of 5.4 years including 83% whose disease had progressed on or within 60 d of last therapy and 17% whose disease had achieved <25 % response to the regimen immediately preceding study entry. Of the 266 pts enrolled pts, 257 were evaluable for response; 9 patients were considered not evaluable based on missing baseline or lacking at least one post-baseline M-protein. An ORR (\u2265PR) of 24% with a median DOR of 7.4 mo (range 6.2\u201310.3) was determined. Responses are detailed in the table .  Response category (n=257) . n (%) * .

Median DOR of pts with MRs was 6.3 months, indicating that long-term MRs were observed. An additional 32% (83 pts) achieved SD for at least 6 wks. To date, 79 pts (30%) completed \u22656 C and >11% of pts have completed all 12 C of protocol specified therapy and most have entered the extension protocol; 15 pts remain on study (all >10 C). OS and TTP data for the overall population will also be reported. The enrolled pts in this study were heavily pretreated having received a median of 5 prior lines of therapy (range 1\u201320, median of 13 anti-myeloma agents). 85% of pts had received at least 2 and 37% had received at least 3 drugs in the regimen just prior to entering the study. Prior anti-myeloma agents included 99.6% (265/266 pts) BTZ (median 2 prior regimens containing BTZ), 99.6% either THAL (74%) or LEN (94%), 98% corticosteroids, 91% alkylating agents, and 74% stem cell transplant; 65% of pts were refractory to BTZ at any point in time prior to study entry. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events \u2265 Grade (G) 3 regardless of relationship to study drug were predominantly hematologic and included thrombocytopenia (22%), anemia (20%), lymphopenia (10%), pneumonia (8%), neutropenia (8%), fatigue (7%), hyponatremia (5%), and hypercalcemia (5%). Although 206 pts (77%) had G1/2 peripheral neuropathy (PN) at baseline, new onset PN was infrequent and G \u22653 PN occurred in <1%. Interestingly, in this subset of patients, efficacy response was nearly identical to that seen in the full study population with an ORR (\u2265PR) of 24%. Conclusions: Single-agent CFZ achieved durable responses in pts with R/R MM whose disease had relapsed after all available therapies including BTZ and immunomodulatory agents. The CBR and median DOR achieved with this steroid-sparing regimen establish that CFZ has the potential to offer substantial clinical benefit to patients with relapsed or refractory disease. CFZ was well-tolerated and side effects were clinically manageable with no new or unexpected toxicities observed. Importantly, exacerbation of pre-existing PN was uncommon. Cumulative side effects were not observed, allowing prolonged single-agent dosing for chronic disease control. Disclosures: Siegel: Millenium: Consultancy, Honoraria; Celgene: Consultancy, Honoraria.
