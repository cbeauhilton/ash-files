    "abstract_text": "We have reported on the safety and efficacy of RIC UCB transplantation for patients with advanced hematologic diseases. Here we report on 65 patients, median age of 46 yrs (range, 6\u201368), who underwent RIC UCB transplantation for the treatment of advanced lymphoid malignancies between October 2001 and December 2006. Patients received either one (n=9) or two (n=56) UCB unit grafts matched at 4\u20136/6 HLA loci. Forty were male and 27 CMV seropositive. Diagnoses were follicular lymphoma (FL, n=11), small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL/CLL, n=9), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL, n=8), large cell lymphoma (LCL, n=14), and Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (HL, n=23). Conditioning regimen was cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg (Day-6), fludarabine 40mg/m2 for 5 days (Day-6 to -2), and single fraction total body irradiation of 200cGy (Day -1), plus cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil (to day +30). At transplantation 53 patients (81%) had chemotherapy sensitive disease, 5 (8%) had bulky adenopathy (\u2265 5 cm), 27 (42%) had prior radiation therapy, 26 (40%) had prior autologous transplant, 22 (34%) had an elevated LDH, and 10 (15%) had marrow involvement. The median number of prior treatment courses was 4 (range, 1\u20139). The median follow-up for survivors is 23 mos. (range, 4\u201362). Patients were analyzed as indolent (IND=FL+ SLL/CLL), aggressive (AGR=LCL+MCL), and HL. Incidence of acute GVHD grades II\u2013IV was 57% (95%CI, 43\u201370); grades III\u2013IV 25% (95%CI, 14\u201335); chronic GVHD 23% (95%CI, 11\u201335), with similar incidence of acute and chronic GVHD between lymphoma subgroups. The 3-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 15% (95%CI, 5\u201326) with no significant difference among lymphoma subgroups (IND 5% vs. AGR 24% vs. HL 13%, p=.41). Thirty-five patients (53%) had relapsed or progressive disease with a 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) of 31% (95%CI, 19\u201344); IND 44% (95%CI, 22\u201366); AGR 20% (95%CI, 2\u201339); HL 35% (95%CI, 15\u201354) (p=.30). Fourteen of these 35 patients were treated with tapering of immunosuppression and rituximab and/or chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and 8 achieved a complete remission. Three-year OS was 55% (95%CI, 42\u201368); IND 69% (95%CI, 48\u201390); AGR 54% (95%CI, 33\u201375); HL 43% (95%CI, 18\u201369) (p=.37). We conclude that RIC UCB is effective alternative for the treatment of patients with advanced lymphoid malignancy resulting in acceptable NRM and encouraging OS and PFS. Patients with advanced lymphoid malignancies should be considered for a RIC UCBT as a promising alternative for those with no available sibling donor."
