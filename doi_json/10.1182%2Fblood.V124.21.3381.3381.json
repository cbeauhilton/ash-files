    "abstract_text": "P21-activated serine/threonine kinase 4 (PAK4) is a major effector of Cdc42 and is essential for cytoskeleton reorganization. PAK4 is activated in cancer cells, promotes cell migration and anchorage-independent cell growth, and protects against apoptosis induction. With cellular migration playing a significant role in multiple myeloma (MM) cell growth and survival, we investigated the expression and subcellular localization of PAK4 in MM cells. We observed a high level of un-phosphorylated PAK4 in the cytoplasm and high levels of phosphorylated PAK4 in the nucleus. In a gain-of-function study, over-expression of PAK4-eGFP in PAK4-deficient MM cells (RPMI8226) significantly increased cell proliferation and survival. Conversely, in a loss-of-function study, conditional knock-down of PAK4 expression with TRIPZ-lentiviral vectors decreased MM cell proliferation and survival proportionally to the reduction in PAK4. With a significant impact of PAK4 on MM cell growth, we identified a class of orally bioavailable PAK4 allosteric modulators (PAMs; e.g. KPT-6604, -7189, -7657, -8752). We observed inhibition of MM cell growth and survival after treatment with PAMs even in the presence of bone marrow microenvironment. In addition, there is a significant correlation between PAK4 expression and the inhibition concentration (IC 50 s) of PAMs in proliferation assays. Moreover, inhibition of PAK4 induced receptor and mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathways via Caspase-3, -8, and -9 activation. PAMs had no significant effect on normal PBMCs, suggesting a favorable therapeutic index in MM treatment. Finally, in two murine models of human myeloma, orally bioavailable KPT-8752 given daily was able to inhibit tumor growth in vivo and prolong overall survival. In summary, PAK4 plays an important cellular and molecular function in myeloma and its inhibition with a new class of PAK4 allosteric modulators provides a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of MM.
