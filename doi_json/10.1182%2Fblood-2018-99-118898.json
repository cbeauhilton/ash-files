    "abstract_text": "OBJECTIVE: Relapse after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is still challenging for high-risk aggressive lymphoma. This study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of maintenance therapy post-ASCT. METHODS: From June 2009 to March 2018, patients with high-risk aggressive lymphoma in our hospital were treated with maintenance therapy post-ASCT according to the patient's wishes, and then assigned to maintenance group or observation group. The end point of follow-up was disease progression or death. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared between these two groups. RESULTS: A total of 79 patients were enrolled, with a median age of 38 years (8-64 years), 50 males and 29 females. IPI score \u22652 points in 28 cases, stage III-IV in 58 cases, B symptoms in 21 cases, Extranodal lesions \u2265 2 in 17 cases, bone marrow infiltration in 15 cases, and 24 cases with partial remission (PR) prior to ASCT. In addition to 2 cases of early death, the remaining 77 patients with lymphoma were underwent successfully transplantation and achieved CR post-ASCT. 54 patients were assigned to the observation group, and 23 patients to the maintenance group, including 17 with rituximab and 6 with DPP/DCEP-G alternation regimen. There were no s ignificant differences in gender, age, pre-transplant disease status, and hematopoietic reconstitution between the two groups. The main causes of death were disease recurrence. No serious adverse reactions occurred during the maintenance treatment period. After a median follow-up of 616 days (12-2854 days), the relapse rates of the observation group and the maintenance group were 49.1% vs 12.9%, and the DFS of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd years were 62.8% VS 93.8%, 48.1% VS 87.1%, and 45.3% VS 87.1% (P = 0.007), respectively. The OS of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd years were 89.3% VS 100%, 83.2% VS 92.9%, and 76.2% VS 92.9% (P=0.212), respectively. Conclusion: Maintenance therapy post-ASCT could reduce the risk of relapse and promote disease-free survival, which deserves further investigation.
