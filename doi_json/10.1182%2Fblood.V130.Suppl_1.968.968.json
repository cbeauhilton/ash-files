    "abstract_text": "For the past decades the principal strategy for treating the \u03b2-globinopathies [sickle cell disease (SCD) and \u03b2-thalassemia] has been to devise methods for increasing the levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in adult erythroid cells, as a strong clinical literature has demonstrated that high HbF levels ameliorate disease pathophysiology. We originally reported the lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1) as a new protein involved in the regulation of the fetal \u03b3-globin genes. Inhibition of LSD1 using either RNAi or by the momoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine in primary human erythroid progenitor cells induces HbF to therapeutic levels. Thus, inhibition of LSD1 activity presents a novel exploratory avenue as a therapeutic strategy to treat SCD. Subsequent studies using another inhibitor RN-1 showed that RN-1 treatment of SCD mice results in increased HbF synthesis and leads to effective improvement of many aspects of the disease pathology normally associated with sickle cell disease. Here we report studies designed to examine the in vivo effects of some additional, publically available small molecule chemical inhibitors of LSD1 on HbF synthesis and erythroid physiology in SCD mice. In control SCD mice treated with DMSO only, the number of HbF positive cells was about 2.5% of total in RBC, while in SCD mice exposed to GSK-LSD1, or OG-L002, there was a statistically significant increase in the percentage of HbF positive cells after 4 weeks of treatment (up to 8%, or 6% respectively). Furthermore, sickled RBCs and reticulocytes are significantly reduced while the number of mature erythrocytes increased markedly in the peripheral blood of GSK-LSD1, or OG-L002 treated SCD mice. These findings suggest that GSK-LSD1 and/or OG-L002 could be potentially new HbF inducers based on LSD1 inhibition. We believe that these experiments will be of wide general interest and will be the foundation for development of small molecule therapeutics with which to treat hemoglobinopathies.
