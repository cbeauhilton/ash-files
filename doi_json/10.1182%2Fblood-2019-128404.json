    "abstract_text": "Background: Acalabrutinib is a highly selective, covalent irreversible Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor with minimal activity against other kinases. Acalabrutinib has demonstrated durable responses as a single agent or combined with O in treatment-na\u00efve (TN) CLL. Here, interim results are presented for the multicenter, open-label Phase 3 ELEVATE-TN study (NCT02475681), which evaluated the efficacy and safety of acalabrutinib + O vs acalabrutinib alone vs O + Clb in pts with TN CLL. Methods: Eligible pts had TN CLL requiring treatment per iwCLL criteria and were aged \u226565 y or 6, creatinine clearance <70 mL/min). Pts were randomized 1:1:1 to receive oral acalabrutinib (100 mg twice daily continuously) alone or combined with intravenous O (1000 mg on Days 1, 2 [split 100/900], 8, and 15 of Cycle 2, and Day 1 of subsequent 28-day cycles for a total of 6 cycles), or O plus oral Clb (0.5 mg/kg on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for 6 cycles). Pts were stratified by del(17p) status, ECOG status (\u22641 vs 2), and geographic region. The primary endpoint was independent review committee (IRC)-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) with acalabrutinib + O vs O + Clb. Key secondary endpoints included IRC-assessed PFS with acalabrutinib vs O + Clb, IRC-assessed overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and safety. Minimal residual disease (MRD) in peripheral blood or bone marrow was assessed in pts with investigator-assessed complete response (CR)/CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi). Crossover to acalabrutinib monotherapy was allowed for pts in the O + Clb arm with IRC-confirmed progression. Results: From 9/14/2015-2/8/2017, 535 pts were randomized to the acalabrutinib + O (n=179), acalabrutinib (n= 179), or O + Clb (n=177) arms. The median age was 70 y (range, 41-91); 69% had high- and 12% had very high-risk CLL IPI scores. At a median follow-up of 28 mo, acalabrutinib + O significantly prolonged PFS vs O + Clb (median not reached [NR] vs 22.6 mo; HR 0.10, 95% CI 0.06-0.18, P <0.0001), reducing the risk of progression or death by 90% (Figure). Acalabrutinib (median NR) also prolonged PFS vs O + Clb (HR 0.20, 95% CI 0.13-0.31, P <0.0001). Estimated 30-mo PFS rates with acalabrutinib + O, acalabrutinib, and O + Clb were 90%, 82%, and 34%, respectively. PFS improvement with acalabrutinib + O or acalabrutinib vs O + Clb was consistent across subgroups examined including del(17p) (HR [95% CI]; 0.13 [0.04-0.46]; 0.20 [0.06-0.64]). Median OS was not reached in any arm; (HR [95% CI]; acalabrutinib + O vs O + Clb, 0.47 [0.21-1.06], P =0.0577; acalabrutinib vs O + Clb, 0.60 [0.28-1.27], P =0.1556). In the acalabrutinib + O, acalabrutinib, and O + Clb arms, the estimated 30-mo OS rates were 95%, 94%, and 90%, respectively. Five pts (3%) in the acalabrutinib + O arm, 11 pts (6%) in the acalabrutinib arm, and 55 pts (31%) in the O + Clb arm had received a next therapy; 45 pts (25%) in the O + Clb arm crossed over to the acalabrutinib monotherapy arm. IRC-assessed ORR was higher with acalabrutinib + O (94%; 95% CI, 89.3%-96.5%) vs O + Clb (79%; 95% CI, 71.9%-83.9%; P <0.0001); the ORR with acalabrutinib monotherapy was 85%. CR rates were higher with acalabrutinib + O (13%) vs O + Clb (5%); there was 1 CR in the acalabrutinib monotherapy arm. MRD data will be presented. The median treatment duration was 27.7 mo for acalabrutinib + O (range, 2.3-40.3) and acalabrutinib (range, 0.3-40.2) and 5.6 mo (range, 0.9-7.4) for O + Clb. Common adverse events (AEs) are shown in the Table. AEs were similar between the acalabrutinib-containing arms. Infusion reactions were less frequent with acalabrutinib + O (13%) than with O + Clb (40%). AEs led to treatment discontinuation in 20 pts (11%) on acalabrutinib + O, 16 pts (9%) on acalabrutinib, and 25 pts (14%) on O + Clb. With >2 y of follow-up, 79.3% of pts in both the acalabrutinib-containing arms remain on single-agent acalabrutinib. AEs of interest (acalabrutinib + O or acalabrutinib vs O + Clb) were atrial fibrillation (any grade: 3% or 4% vs 1%), bleeding (any grade/Grade \u22653: 43%/2% or 39%/2% vs 12%/0%), and hypertension (Grade \u22653: 3% or 2% vs 3%). Conclusions: Acalabrutinib + O and acalabrutinib monotherapy significantly improved PFS vs O + Clb, with tolerable safety in pts with TN CLL. Despite cross over for disease progression in the O + Clb arm, a trend toward improved OS was observed in both acalabrutinib arms, though longer follow-up is needed.
