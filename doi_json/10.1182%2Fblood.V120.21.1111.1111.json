    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1111 Collapse of membrane lipid asymmetry is a hallmark of blood coagulation. TMEM16F of the TMEM16 family that includes TMEM16A/B Ca 2+ -activated Cl \u2212 channels (CaCCs) is linked to Scott Syndrome with deficient Ca 2+ -dependent lipid scrambling. We generated TMEM16F-knockout mice that exhibit bleeding defects associated with platelet deficiency in Ca 2+ -dependent phosphatidylserine exposure and procoagulant activity, and lack a Ca 2+ -activated cation current in the platelet precursor megakaryocytes. TMEM16F channels permeate both monovalent and divalent cations including Ca 2+ , and exhibit synergistic gating by Ca 2+ and voltage. We further pinpointed a residue in the putative pore region important for the cation versus anion selectivity of TMEM16F-SCAN and TMEM16A-CaCC channels. This study thus identifies a novel Ca 2+ -activated channel permeable to Ca 2+ and critical for Ca 2+ -dependent scramblase activity. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
