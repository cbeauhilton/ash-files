    "abstract_text": "The introduction of Imatinib in the treatment of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) leads to the achievement of Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCR) in about 70% of patients: however, in the remaining 30% of patients there is a persistance of Ph+ cells also after standard (400 mg/day) and increased (600 mg/day) dose of Imatinib. These patients are thus cytogenetically resistant to Imatinib alone and their management is at present unclear. From 11/2002 to 11/2003, 10 patients in chronic phase (6 male and 4 female, median age 52.5 years, range 29 \u2013 68 years) with persistance of 100% Ph+ cells (9 patients) or BCR/ABL + cells (1 patient with Ph- BCR/ABL+ CML at onset) after standard (at least 6 months of treatment) followed by increased dose (at least 3 months of treatment) of Imatinib alone, were considered resistant and added Hydroxyurea (HU) to Imatinib. Seven patients have been pretreated with IFN before Imatinib; median times from diagnosis and from Imatinib treatment to HU addition were 51 months (range 23 \u2013 151) and 14 months (range 10 \u2013 31), respectively. HU was given according to WBC count: patients with WBC < 10 x 10 9 /l started HU at the dose of 1 g/day, patients with WBC > 10 x 10 9 /l at the dose of 1.5 g/day. Imatinib was continued at the same previous dosage (600 mg/day in 6 patients and 400 mg/day in 4 patients who did not tolerate increased dosage for hematological toxicity). Three patients achieved a complete response (2 CCR after 3 and 12 months respectively and 1 molecular complete response after 9 months in the patient Ph- BCR/ABL+ at onset) and 1 patient achieved a partial CR (Ph+ < 33%) after 9 months: the remaining 6 patients were resistant with persistance of 100% Ph+ cells. Toxicity was mild and only 1 patient discontinued for 2 weeks the association due to transient thrombocytopenia: no extra-hematological toxicity has been recorded. After a median follow-up of 14 months (range 20 \u2013 10), 2 patients (1 resistant and 1 after 5 months from the achievement of CCR) evolved in Blastic Phase (BP), 5 patients are in stable chronic phase with 100% Ph+ cells and 3 patients are still in response after 4,6 and 7 months respectively. In conclusion, the association of HU with Imatinib seems capable to induce cytogenetic response in at least one third of patients resistant to Imatinib alone, with minimal toxicity: a longer follow-up and a comparison with other associations is needed to evaluate the quality and duration of response in such group of patients.",
