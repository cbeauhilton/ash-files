    "abstract_text": "Several lines of evidence indicate that the pharmacological activation of fetal hemoglobin is an effective therapy for sickle cell anemia and beta thalassemia, but novel treatments for these diseases are needed. We developed and validated a high throughput assay to detect differential regulation of the globin genes and utilized this assay in a small molecule screen to identify novel compounds that increase the relative expression of gamma globin. In our assay, transcripts for the alpha, beta, delta, epsilon, gamma, theta, and zeta globin genes are amplified by multiplexed ligation-mediated PCR. Labeled amplicons are captured on different fluorescent microspheres using molecular barcodes, and the relative abundance of labeled amplicons is detected by high speed flow cytometry. To recapitulate the activity of compounds in the bone marrow of patients as accurately as possible, the screen was performed using primary human erythroid progenitor cells cultured in vitro . The assay was adapted to 384-well format with robotic liquid handling. In validation studies, the assay detected the expected increases in globin gene expression during erythroid differentiation, increased gamma globin expression in umbilical cord blood progenitor cells, and increased gamma globin expression in cells treated with known inducers of fetal hemoglobin including hydroxyurea and sodium butyrate. We screened a library of 1040 known bioactive compounds, 75% of which are FDA approved drugs, and a library of 600 compounds produced by diversity oriented synthesis that have been shown to inhibit histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. In the screen, we rediscovered previously identified globin gene regulators, further validating our globin assay. For example, corticosteroids, known activators of fetal hemoglobin, increased the relative expression of gamma globin. Thyroid hormone specifically increased expression of delta globin, consistent with clinical observations that hemoglobin A 2 levels are increased in hyperthyroidism and decreased in hypothyroidism. We identified ten novel compounds from the diversity oriented synthesis library that powerfully induce expression of the gamma globin gene relative to beta globin. Moreover, HDAC inhibition reversed the ontogeny of globin gene expression, coordinately increasing expression of fetal and embryonic relative to the adult globin genes. Relative to beta globin gene expression, gamma and epsilon globin were induced while delta globin was unaffected by HDAC inhibitors; relative to alpha globin expression, zeta globin was increased and theta globin was unaffected. The identification of compounds that differentially regulate globin gene expression may provide lead compounds for the development of novel therapies for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia and may help elucidate the molecular events underlying switching of the globin genes during normal development.",
