    "abstract_text": "Background Hypomethylating agents are the standard therapy for higher-risk (HR, Int-2 and high-risk) myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Lenalidomide is effective in lower-risk (LR) MDS, with or without 5q-, in HR-MDS and in acute leukemia. Many patients remain resistant to a single agent. A potential synergistic effect of both agents has been shown [Sekeres M et al, Am J Hemat 2010; Blood 2012]. Thus, the MDS Israel group has designed a phase II clinical trial (NIH trial #: TASMC-10-MM-0437-09-CTIL). Protocol The ViLen-01 protocol consists of 3 phases. The induction phase includes 6 monthly cycles of SC azacitidine (Aza), 75 mg/m daily, days 1-5, and PO lenalidomide (Len) 10 mg daily, days 6-21, followed by a 7-day (days 22-28) respite. The consolidation consists of 6 monthly cycles of Aza only for 5 days each, followed by 12 months of maintenance with Len only. Response is evaluated by the IWG criteria [Cheson B et al, Blood 2006]. Results As of July 2013, 7 medical centers have enrolled 18 patients. Patients had been diagnosed with either HR-MDS, or LR-MDS with transfusion-dependence, erythropoietin resistance and poor cytogenetics. Adverse events (AE) were as expected in these elderly HR-MDS patients. The common AEs were grade IV transient cytopenias, requiring dose modification in 15 patients. Only 2 patients stopped the protocol due to AE. Thirteen patients completed the induction, 8 continued to consolidation, and 5 patients continued to maintenance. Eight of the 18 enrolled patients (44%, 8 of the 13, 61.5%) who had completed the induction, achieved CR. Three of the 8 patients in CR also attained cytogenetic response. The other 5 had normal karyotype on study initiation. Five other patients obtained erythroid response and became transfusion-free, and another patient achieved platelet response, for a total of 14 (78%) responders. It is still too early to evaluate response duration and survival. One patient is in early induction, and 4 are still being treated. The others have either died or have discontinued for various reasons (patient refusal, progressive disease, transplant). Conclusions These preliminary data in a small group of patients with HR-MDS and expected poor prognosis, demonstrate a high response rate and a reasonable safety profile. The study is ongoing. If these results are confirmed in randomized trials, it may set new standards for the treatment of this disease. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
