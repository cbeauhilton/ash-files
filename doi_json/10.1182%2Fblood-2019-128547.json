    "abstract_text": "Background : Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a therapeutic challenge in elderly or unfit patients (pts) and high-risk subgroups. DEC10-VEN has shown high efficacy in these pts. However, outcomes in specific mutational subgroups are unknown. Here we present the results in mutational subgroups and resistance patterns in pts treated with DEC10-VEN (NCT03404193). Methods : This single-institution phase II study enrolled pts with newly diagnosed (ND) AML (>60 years) ineligible for intensive chemotherapy, relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML, and secondary AML (sAML) with or without prior therapy. DEC was given 20 mg/m 2 IV daily on day 1-10 until CR/CRi, followed by 5-day cycles. VEN was given for 21-28 days in cycle 1 and day 1-21 or shorter duration thereafter. BCR-ABL1 and FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i) were allowed as appropriate. Amplicon-based next-generation sequencing targeting the entire coding regions of 81 myeloid genes was performed on screening bone marrow aspirate with a MiSeq platform. The analytical sensitivity was established at 5% mutant reads in a background of wild type reads. Previously described somatic mutations registered in COSMIC were considered as potential driver mutations. Results : High response rates were noted across mutational subgroups of both previously untreated and previously treated AML ( Table 1 and 2 ). The median follow-up for the entire cohort was 8.1 months (mo). In previously untreated AML (ND AML and untreated sAML, n=49), the CR/CRi rate in NPM1 mut pts was 100% (n=13), in RUNX1 mut pts was 100% (n=8), in IDH1/2 mut pts was 92% (n=12), in TP53 mut pts was 85% (n=13), and in N/KRAS mut pts was 77% (n=13, Table 1 ). The median overall survival (OS) among previously untreated NPM1 mut pts was not reached (NR), for RUNX1 mut pts was NR, for IDH1/2 mut pts was 12.4 mo, for TP53 mut pts was 5.8 mo, and for N/KRAS mut was 12.4 mo. The median DOR for NPM1 mut pts was 8.5 mo, for RUNX1 mut pts was NR, for IDH1/2 mut pts was NR, for TP53 mut pts was 5.7 mo, and for N/KRAS mut pts was 6.7 mo ( Table 1 ). The one pt with NPM1 mut who relapsed had co-occurring ASXL1 mut and NRAS mut at screening. In previously treated AML (treated sAML and R/R AML, n=52), the CR/CRi rate in NPM1 mut pts was 60% (n=10), in IDH1/2 mut pts was 50% (n=8), and in TP53 mut pts was 21% (n=14, Table 2 ). The median OS for NPM1 mut pts was NR, for IDH1/2 mut pts was 7.8 mo, and for TP53 mut pts was 4.5 mo. The median DOR for NPM1 mut pts was NR, for IDH1/2 mut pts was NR, and for TP53 mut pts was 3.2 mo ( Table 2 ). The only grade 4 TLS event occurred in a pt with NPM1 mut and IDH2 mut and baseline WBC of 28x10 9 /L. 2 other pts with high % of PB blasts and FLT3 mut experienced grade 3 TLS. Among 15 pts with FLT3 -ITD/TKD, 8 pts received sorafenib, 5 pts received midostaurin, and 2 pts did not receive FLT3i (1 insurance non-approval and 1 very low ITD ratio). Among ND FLT3 mut AML pts (n=7), the CR/CRi rate was 100% (n=5) in pts receiving FLT3i with negative MRD by flow cytometry (FCM) in 80% pts, with median OS of 8.8 mo and median DOR not reached ( Table 1 ). Of the 2 FLT3 -ITD pts not receiving FLT3i, 1 pt with FLT3 -ITD of 0.47 did not respond, and 1 pt with low FLT3 -ITD of 0.02 achieved CR MRD-. Among previously treated FLT3 mut pts (n=8), all received FLT3i with a CR/CRi rate of 38% (n=5) and negative MRD by FCM in 75% pts tested (3/4). The median OS was 6.4 mo and the median DOR was 6.6 mo ( Table 2 ). 2 pts had received prior FLT3i, 1 pt achieved morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS), and the other pt did not respond. 1 pt with new t(9;22) identified at 4 th relapse achieved a MLFS after 1 cycle with addition of ponatinib and transitioned to allogeneic transplant. Overall, pts with durable CR/CRi/MLFS sustained without relapse till data cut-off, had significantly higher proportion of mutations in NPM1 and DNA methylation pathways ( DNMT3A , TET2 , IDH1/2 ) compared to pts refractory to, or relapsing after DEC10-VEN ( Table 3 , Fig. 1 ). Pts with relapsed or refractory disease to DEC10-VEN had significantly higher frequency of N/KRAS mut , ASXL1 mut , and TP53 mut compared to pts with durable CR/CRi/MLFS ( Table 3, Fig. 1 ). TP53 mut associated with worse OS on multivariable analysis (HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-5.7, p=0.003). Conclusion : DEC10-VEN is an effective regimen for AML. Addition of FLT3i to DEC10-VEN was safe and may improve upon responses in FLT3 mut pts. Mutations in NPM1 and DNA methylation pathways were associated with more durable responses while mutations in ASXL1 , RAS and TP53 were associated with refractory disease or relapse.
