    "abstract_text": "The third-generation combined oral contraceptive pill, Yasmin\u00ae, which contains 30 ug ethinyl estradiol and 3 mg of drospirenone, has been marketed as safe and effective, but the risks of arterial thrombotic events in women using Yasmin\u00ae are unknown. We report a case of retinal artery occlusion in a woman using Yasmin\u00ae, and review the literature for other cases of arterial thrombotic events in women taking Yasmin\u00ae. An extensive search using Pubmed, Ovid, and Medline, revealed three previously reported cases of arterial thrombotic events, in women using Yasmin\u00ae (see table below). Similar to the three prior cases, our case study had no known acquired or hereditary thombophilic conditions. Unlike the previous three cases, our subject did not smoke and developed her arterial thrombus late, approximately three years after initiating Yasmin\u00ae. It appears that the risk for arterial thrombotic events may occur at anytime. Large scale studies determining relative incidence, as well as post-marketing adverse effects are needed to determine risk and incidence while using Yasmin\u00ae.
