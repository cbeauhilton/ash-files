    "abstract_text": "Introductio n: Clinical trials in patients with high risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have shown that these patients benefit from the available hypomethylating agents 5-azacytidine and decitabine. The majority of these patients display hypercellular bone marrow, but a small proportion despite the excess of blasts, exhibit marrow hypocellularity (<30% cellularity). Data are limited for the efficacy and safety of treatment with hypomethylating agents in this patient subgroup. In the present study we examined the effect of bone marrow cellularity in the overall survival in patients with MDS treated with azacitidine. Patients & Methods: This is a retrospective multicenter study from the Hellenic National MDS Registry (EAKMYS) on behalf of the Hellenic MDS Study Group. Between 1.1.2009 and 31.12.2018 a total of 1161 MDS patients who have received treatment with azacytidine have been registered. Complete patient information and follow-up were available for 989 patients, and all these have been included in the final analysis. Statistical analysis was performed and overall survival (OS) was evaluated, using Kaplan-Meier estimates (GraphPad Prism software, CA). A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Forty nine patients had a hypocellular bone marrow (hMDS), representing the 4.95% of the whole patient population. Of these patients 39 were men (5.3% of all men included in the study) and 10 were women representing the 2.98% of all women enrolled (male to female ratio 3.9). In the non-hypoplastic group, 750 were men and 358 were women (male to female ratio 2.09). The median age at diagnosis for the hMDS group was 70.8 years, compared to 72.8 years in the non-hypoplastic group. The IPSS-R prognostic risk categorization included 15 hMDS patients in the low group, 9 in the intermediate, 14 in the high and 11 in the very high risk group. Twenty-six patients (53%) of the hMDS group had bone marrow blasts between 10 and 20%, and the remaining 23 (47%) had 5-10% blasts. The patients with hMDS received an average of 10 cycles of azacytidine treatment during the follow-up period (range 2-29 cycles). The outcomes tested were overall survival and progression to AML. The median overall survival of patients with hMDS, following azacytidine treatment start, was not significantly different from the median survival of patients with non-hypoplastic MDS [20 months versus 16 months in the non-hypoplastic group (95% CI of ratio: 0.839 to 1.863). The survival curves were not significantly different between the hMDS and non-hypoplastic MDS group (p=0.32, Figure 1). Progression to AML was also evaluated. Eleven (22.4 %) hMDS patients showed disease progression to AML. Patients with hMDS had significantly prolonged estimated median time to AML transformation, compared to the non-hypoplastic MDS population (31.7 versus 22 months respectively, p<0.001). There were not any major safety issues among patients with hMDS, despite the increased RBC and Platelet transfusion needs. The infectious episodes and the hospitalization courses did not differ significantly between the hMDS and the non-hypoplastic group. Discussion and Conclusive remarks: In this retrospective study, in which a large number of MDS patients was analyzed, we showed that bone marrow cellularity does not affect the outcome in patients treated with azacyitidine. Patients with hMDS show statistically significant slower AML progression compared to non-hypoplastic MDS. Bone marrow cellularity should not be a contraindication for using hypomethylating agents as a therapeutic option, and this type of treatment can be used safely, when indicated, also in patients with hMDS.
