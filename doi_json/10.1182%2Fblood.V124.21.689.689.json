    "abstract_text": "Background: The aim of FVIII prophylaxis in Hemophilia A management is the reduction of risk for any bleed events (BE) in order to preserve long-term joint health and QOL. One proposed measure of the ideal prophylactic outcome is the virtual elimination of all BE not associated with trauma and/or of spontaneous etiology. Given the wide inter-patient variance in PK parameters, long-term prophylaxis outcomes and costs of therapy, PK-guided dosing has become an attractive approach to add more precision to dosing decisions and improve outcomes. Knowledge of the appropriate FVIII trough target for each individual patient to achieve a bleed-free outcome is needed however to design the ideal personalized PK-guided regimen. Objective: Model individual FVIII trough targets for achieving ideal outcomes in hemophilia A patients prescribed PK-guided prophylaxis every third day. Methods: FVIII infusion and BE records, and PK parameters from each subject participating in the 12-month PK-guided dosing arm of the randomized rAHF-PFM prophylaxis study (Valentino et al, 2012) were used to determine the predicted FVIII level at time of each BE. Median and maximum predicted FVIII values at time of spontaneous/non-trauma BE for all sites, and for joint and non-joint sites were estimated per subject. Number (%) of subjects with any spontaneous/non-trauma BE that occurred at predicted FVIII levels (maximum value and/or median value for those with more than one bleed) above and below specific theoretical FVIII trough values was modeled. Results: Of 34 subjects on PK-guided prophylaxis with rAHF-PFM targeting 1% trough every third day, 19 (56%) had no spontaneous BE during one year observation at FVIII levels (median) above the theoretical trough value of 1%. The number (%) of subjects with no spontaneous/non-trauma BE at FVIII levels (median) above the theoretical trough value of 3%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% levels increased to 71%, 79%, 31 91%, 97%, and 100%, respectively ( Figure 1 ). All 57 spontaneous/non-trauma BE occurred at predicted FVIII levels \u226430%.

Targeting a 1% trough FVIII level every 72 hrs was effective with 56% of subjects achieving a full year with no spontaneous BE. Modeling showed that targeting a 3 - 5% FVIII trough level would have led to more than 75% overall achieving zero spontaneous annual bleed rate (ABR), and that others may have benefitted from trough targets even as high as \u226515%. While this study could not necessarily account for or examine the role of differing levels of physical activity and/or arthropathy on levels of bleeding risk, modeling of FVIII levels post-infusion using individual PK parameters and infusion records along with the contemporaneous overlay of BE should provide valuable insight when designing the optimal, personalized prophylaxis regimen for patients.
