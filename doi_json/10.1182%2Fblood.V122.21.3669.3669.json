    "abstract_text": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) recently emerged as central regulators of chromatin and gene expression. We created a comprehensive lncRNA HemAtlas in human and murine blood cells. We sampled RNA from differentiated granulocytes, monocytes, erythroid precursors, in vitro maturated megakaryocytes, CD4-T and CD8-T cells, NK cells, B cells and stem cells (human CD34 + cord blood hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells [CB-HSPCs]) and subjected them to microarray analysis of mRNA and lncRNA expression. Moreover, the human LncRNA HemAtlas was complemented with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs; CD34 + /CD38 - ), megakaryocytic/erythroid progenitors (MEPs; CD34 + /CD38 + /CD45RA - /CD123 - ), common myeloid progenitors (CMPs; CD34 + /CD38 + /CD45RA - /CD123 + ) and granulocytic/monocytic progenitors (GMPs; CD34 + /CD38 + /CD45RA + /CD123 + ) from fetal liver (FL), CB and peripheral blood (PB) HSPCs. The complete microarray profiling of the differentiated cells yielded a total of 1588 (on Arraystar\u00ae platform) and 1439 lncRNAs (on NCode\u00ae platform), which were more than 20-fold differentially expressed between the blood lineages. Thus, a core fraction of lncRNAs is modulated during differentiation. LncRNA subtype comparison for each lineage, schematics of mRNA:lncRNA lineage coexpression and genomic loci correlation revealed a complex genetic interplay regulating hematopoiesis. Integrated bioinformatic analyses determined the top 50 lineage-specific lncRNAs for each blood cell lineage in both species, while gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) confirmed lineage identity. The megakaryocytic/erythroid expression program was already evident in MEPs, while monocytoc/granulocytic signatures were found in GMPs. Amongst all significantly associated genes, 46% were lncRNAs, while 5% belonged to the subgroup of long intervening non-coding RNAs (lincRNA). For human megakaryocytes, erythroid cells, monocytes, granulocytes and HSPCs we validated four lincRNA candidates, respectively, to be specifically expressed by qRT-PCR. RNAi knock-down studies using two shRNA constructs per candidate demonstrated an impact on proliferation, survival or lineage specification for at least one specific lincRNA per lineage. We detected a 3 to 4.5-fold increased colony-forming capacity upon knockdown of the HSPC-specific PTMAP6 lincRNA in methylcellulose colony-forming unit (CFU) assays. Inversely, knockdown of monocyte-specific DB519945 resulted in 3.5 to 5.5-fold reduction of the total number of CFUs. Likewise, the total CFU counts was 4.3-fold reduced upon knockdown of megakaryocyte-specific AK093872. Kockdown of the granulocyte-specific LINC00173 perturbed granulocytic in vitro differentiation as assessed by the percentage of CD66b + /CD13 + granulocytes (2-fold reduction) and nuclear lobulation (MGG-stained cytospins). The erythroid-specific transcript AY034471 showed 25 to 50% reduction in burst-forming units in collagen-based assays. Thus, our study provides a global human hematopoietic lncRNA expression resource and defines blood-lineage specific lncRNA marker and regulator genes.
