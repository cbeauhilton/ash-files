    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4599 Filamin A is a major non-muscle actin binding protein that plays an important role in cross-linking cortical actin filaments into three-dimensional networks. In addition to its role as a cytoskeletal scaffolding molecule, Filamin A is also known to bind more than 30 other proteins, regulating their subcellular location and coordinating their ability to signal. To analyze the role of filamin A in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell maturation, we generated filamin A Low ES cells by introducing a micro-RNA that specifically downregulates filamin A expression under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. Filamin A Low ES cells exhibited a more rounded morphology than did their wild-type filamin A Normal counterparts, and expressed increased levels of the ES cell transcription factor Nanog. In contrast, non-transfected cells in the same culture dish retained normal expression of filamin A, expressed low levels of Nanog, and exhibited a more elongated and spread phenotype characteristic of differentiating cells. Further evidence for a role for filamin A in ES cell differentiation was provided by the observation that withdrawing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to induce ES cell differentiation was accompanied by increased expression of filamin A, a concomitant loss of Nanog expression, and acquisition of a differentiated morphology. Filamin A Low ES cells were able to retain their undifferentiated phenotype, as evaluated by alkaline phosphatase (Alp) activity, in the presence of a 10-fold lower concentration of LIF than was permissive for filamin A Normal ES cells, or following exposure to the differentiating agent, bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4). LIF-induced phosphorylation of ERK was decreased in filamin A Low relative to filamin A Normal ES cells, as was BMP-induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5 - two signaling pathways that initiate ES cell differentiation. Finally, embryoid bodies comprised of filamin A Low ES cells were unable to differentiate into CD41+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that filamin A plays a previously unrecognized, but critical, scaffolding function that support both the LIF - ERK and BMP4 - Smad1/5 signaling pathways leading to ES and hematopoietic cell differentiation. Manipulation of filamin levels might be useful in the future to modulate the differentiation requirements for a variety of clinically-and therapeutically-useful stem cells.
