    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1759 Background: Pomalidomide is a second generation IMiDs O\u0300 immunomodulatory drug that has been shown to be active in the treatment of myelofibrosis (MF)-associated anemia ( J Clin Oncol 2009; 27: 4563; Leukemia 2011; 25: 301). In the current sponsor-independent analysis, we report long-term follow up data on patients from the Mayo Clinic who had participated in three consecutive clinical trials using single agent pomalidomide for MF. Methods: From May 2007 to January 2010, 94 patients with MF (including primary and post-polycythemia/essential thrombocythemia) were enrolled in three consecutive phase I and II clinical trials involving pomalidomide with or without prednisone. Eight two patients who received only single agent pomalidomide constitute the study population for the current study. Follow up information was updated in July, 2011. Results: Among the 82 study patients, 19 were included in a phase I dose escalation study (2.5-3.5 mg/day), 58 in a phase II low-dose single agent pomalidomide study (0.5 mg/day), and 5 in a phase II randomized study (2 mg/day). Median age was 67 years and 63 (77 %) patients were red blood cell transfusion dependent at study entry. Forty-five (55%), 24 (29%), 7 (9%), and 2 (2%) patients remained on pomalidomide therapy for at least 6, 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively ( Table 1 ). The overall anemia response rate per IWG-MRT criteria was 27% (22/82). Response occurred in the first 6 months in 21 (96%) of the 22 responders. The median time for response was 2.3 months (range, 1\u201310). The median response duration was 16.5 months (2\u201340). The anemia response rate in patients with spleen size palpable at less than 10 cm below the costal margin was 44 % (17/39) vs. 10 % (4/39) in those whose spleen was palpable at or above 10 cm (p=0.002). The anemia response rate was twice as likely in JAK2 mutated versus non-mutated cases (30% vs 15% p=0.2). Anemia response rate was also higher in patients with at least 50% increase in absolute basophil count during the first month of therapy: 39% (19/49) vs 6% (2/32) p=0.001). The anemia response rate was not significantly affected by karyotype, transfusion need or leukocyte count. Among the anemia responders (n=22), 3 (14%) relapsed in the first 12 months; relapse was more likely in the presence of baseline leukocytosis (p=0.006). Among the 24 patients who took pomalidomide for at lease 12 months, grade 1 sensory neuropathy developed in 4 (16%) patients. Table 1.

Long-term treatment with pomalidomide might be associated with sensory peripheral neuropathy in a subset of treated patients. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
