    "abstract_text": "To improve the effectiveness of Factor VIII replacement therapy for Hemophilia A, we sought to develop a PEGylated Factor VIII that would effectively treat bleeding episodes, while reducing the frequency of intravenous injections required for prophylaxis. Previously, we found that the site-specific PEGylation of Factor VIII (PEG-FVIII) preserves full clotting activity, prolongs circulating half-life and extends therapeutic efficacy in a number of bleeding models in hemophilic mice. To further characterize its activity, four nai\u0308ve Hemophilia A dogs were treated with either PEG-FVIII or unmodified BDD-FVIII in a cross-over study design. All treated dogs showed normalized Whole Blood Clotting Time (WBCT), whole blood Thromboelastograph (TEG) profile, and Cuticle Bleeding Time within 30 min from dosing. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the decay of plasma FVIII activity and antigen levels showed that PEG-FVIII achieved 2-fold longer half-life and reduced clearance and volume of distribution relative to BDD-FVIII. Consistently, PEG-FVIII also demonstrated significantly prolonged efficacy relative to BDD-FVIII by measurement of WBCT and TEG. Both BDD-FVIII and PEG-FVIII were well tolerated in nai\u0308ve HemA dogs, normal hematology and serum chemistry values were observed following administration. However, two naive dogs that received BDD-FVIII and one naive dog that received PEG-FVIII developed detectable neutralizing antibodies to human FVIII as early as on day 9 post-treatment. In summary, consistent with our previously reported findings in hemophilic mice, in comparison to BDD-FVIII, PEG-FVIII demonstrated superior half-life, full activity in stopping acute bleeding and prolonged efficacy in hemophilia A dogs. Taken together, the results support the use of site-specific PEGylation to create a homogeneous therapeutic for both prophylactic and on-demand treatment of patients with Hemophilia A.",
