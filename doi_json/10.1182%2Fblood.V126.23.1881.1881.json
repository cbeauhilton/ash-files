    "abstract_text": "Background: Targeting T cells alone has yielded limited success in the prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) following allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation (BMT). Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in alloreactivity and therefore represent a suitable target. Proteasome inhibitors (PI), with their ability to inhibit the function and maturation of DC, have prompted investigators to examine their potential role in the prevention of GvHD. The investigational PI, ixazomib (IXZ), dissociates rapidly from 20S and is therefore truly reversible. It is also orally bioavailable. Our aim in this study was to explore its effect on healthy volunteer peripheral blood dendritic and T cells and in a pre-clinical GvHD mouse model. Methods: To characterize the effects of IXZ on healthy volunteer peripheral blood DCs, DCs were isolated using EasySep Pan-DC Pre-Enrichment Cocktail with purity over 90% (STEMCELL Technologies). DCs were then treated with IXZ at different concentrations (10-40nM) for 4 hrs and then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 16 hrs. After this treatment, DCs were surface stained with antibodies against maturation markers and analyzed by flow cytometry. DC survival was evaluated with 7AAD staining and FACS analysis. To assess the effect of IXZ on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, DCs were incubated with IXZ at increasing concentration before or after the addition of LPS. Total pro-inflammatory cytokines in the supernatant of tissue culture were measured using EMD Millipore cytokine arrays. Standard mixed lymphocyte reaction and T cell proliferation assays were used to evaluate T cell function. At a minimum, all experiments were done in triplicate. Unpaired t test was used for statistical analysis. A p -value < 0.05 was considered significant. The B6 \u2192 BALB/c pre-clinical GvHD model was adopted to evaluate the effect of IXZ on GvHD development. Mice were transplanted in 3 groups. Group 1 received a lethal dose of total body irradiation (TBI), donor bone marrow (BM) cells, and IXZ, group 2 received TBI, donor BM cells donor splenocytes, and a vehicle, and group 3 received TBI, donor BM cells, donor splenocytes, and IXZ. The dose of BM cells and splenocytes was 5 X 10 6 each. IXZ was given at 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously. Two dosing schedules were tested in 2 separate experiments: day-1 and +2 or day +1 and +4. Results: IXZ inhibited the expression of 6 DC maturation markers including CD40, CD54, CD80, CD83, CD86 and CD197 (CCR-7). The inhibition started at a concentration of 10nM and was dose-related. IXZ also decreased the percentage of total DCs simultaneously expressing multiple markers. DCs viability remained unchanged in comparison to control at a concentration of 10nM and dropped to 68% and 43%, on average with concentrations of 20nM and 40nM, respectively. IXZ significantly decreased DC production of IL-6, IL-12, and IL-23 starting at the concentration of 20nM. IL-1\u03b2 was decreased at the concentration of 40 nM. Importantly, there was no significant change in the cytokine production by DCs when IXZ was added 4 hrs after LPS except for IL-1\u03b2 which increased at 30nM. Starting at the concentration of 10nM, IXZ dose-dependently inhibited T cell proliferation. At 40nM IXZ abolished T cells. In our in vivo study IXZ improved GvHD scores on days +7 and +11 in group 3 in comparison to group 2 when it was given on days -1 and +2. Conversely, when IXZ was given on day +1 and +4, group 3 mice had higher scores of GvHD and worse survival outcomes when compared to group 2. There was no noticeable drug toxicity in group 1 mice. Conclusion: In summary: 1) IXZ inhibits DC maturation with relative preservation of cell viability and inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production in DCs when added before LPS stimulation; 2) IXZ inhibits T-cell proliferation; 3) IXZ affects GvHD development in a schedule-dependent fashion with early administration improving and late administration worsening GvHD. Additional analysis of tissue and serum samples is in progress. These results provide background for careful design of clinical trials using IXZ for the prevention of GvHD.
