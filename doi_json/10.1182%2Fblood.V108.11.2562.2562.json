    "abstract_text": "Objective: Due to absence of a single definitive marker of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and low incidence in human bone marrow, the primary culture of MSCs, conventionally isolated with its characteristic of adherent, were considered to be heterogeneous containing of several subpopulations, which had currently limited our understanding of their biology and therapeutic applications. In our previous study, a novel murine monoclonal antibody (McAb) ZUC3 was produced by hybridoma technology, which was specifically reactive with human MSCs, while showed negative cross-reactivity when screened against a variety of human tissues. Now, ZUC3 antigen positive MSCs population would be further identified by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS). Methods: Bone marrow were taken from the iliac crest of normal healthy adult volunteers, and mononuclear cells were separated by density gradient centrifugation, then separated into positively- and negatively-labelled fractions with McAb ZUC3 by immunomagnetic activated cell sorting. The purity of positive cells was analyzed by flow cytometry, then ZUC3 antigen positive and negative cells were plated respectively in human MSCs medium consisting of 10% FBS, LG-DMEM. Characteristics of ZUC3 antigen positive cells phenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry, and proliferation and multiple differentiation potential of the cells was observed in vitro. Results: Flow cytometric analysis showed that ZUC3 antigen expression by cultured MSCs and mononuclear cells derived from bone marrow were 91.31\u00b12.92%, 0.96\u00b10.28% respectively, and western blotting showed the molecular mass of antigen was about 33KD. The purity of the recovered fractions for ZUC3 by MACS was 76.82\u00b16.32%. The positive cells have adhered to culture flask in vitro, and the quantity of adhered cells that had fibroblast-like morphology increased and proliferated during primary expansion period, while the negative cells were observed as round shape cells without any proliferation. It was demonstrated that ZUC3 antigen positive cells continued growth with spindle-shape, extending beyond 30 population doublings in long-term culture. Analyzed by flow cytometry, the culture-expanded positive cells were uniformly positive for CD29, CD44, CD105, CD106, and lack typical hematopoietic antigens such as CD14, CD34, CD45, HLA-DR, which demonstrated that ZUC3 postive cells sorted from bone marrow mononuclear cells by McAb were MSCs. With proper medium, the ZUC3 antigen positive cells could be successfully induced to differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and neuro-like cells which were positive of neuron markers such as nestin, NSE and NF-M. Conclusion: ZUC3 McAb was a specific surface marker against human MSCs for cell sorting. The ZUC3 antigen positive cells separated from bone marrow mononuclear cells had potential capacity of high proliferation and multiple differentiation.",
