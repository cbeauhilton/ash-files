    "abstract_text": "RS occurs in 5\u201315% CLL, depending on follow-up length and re-biopsy policy. The value of biological and clinical risk factors in predicting RS is unknown and represents the aim of this study. The analysis was based on a consecutive series of 185 CLL. Diagnosis of RS was based on lymph node or extranodal tissue biopsy. RS was diagnosed in 17 cases all represented by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Cumulative incidence of RS at 5 and 10 years was 13.6% (95%CI: 7.0\u201320.1%) and 16.2% (95%CI: 8.0\u201324.4%), respectively. Transformation plateaued at 82 months of follow-up. Median time to transformation was 23.0 months (95%CI: 15.9\u201330.1 months) from CLL diagnosis. IGHV studies documented clonal relationship between CLL and DLBCL in 15/17 (88.2%) cases. At the time of CLL diagnosis, molecular variables predicting RS were: IGHV4\u201339 usage (5-year risk IGHV4-39: 56.2% vs IGHVnon-VH4-39: 11.2%; p1.2 \u00d7 ULN: 37.5% vs LDH <1.2 \u00d7 ULN: 8.6%; p=0.001). Age, sex, Rai stage, splenomegaly, Hb, platelet count, percentage of BM lymphocytes, B2M, ALP, albumin and lymphocyte doubling time did not predict RS. Landmark analysis at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months documented: a significantly increased risk of subsequent RS in progressive CLL vs stable CLL starting from 24 months; and no RS in stable CLL after 48 months of follow up. Multivariate analysis identified CD38 expression (HR 4.22, 95%CI 1.26\u201314.05; p= 0.019) and IGHV4-39 usage (HR 4.29, 95%CI 1.28\u201314.29; p=0.018) as biological predictors of RS, and lymph node \u22653 cm as clinical predictor of RS (HR 8.73, 95%CI 2.45\u201331.05; p=0.001). Our data suggest that RS is predicted by: predominant nodal disease at diagnosis; CD38 expression; and usage of specific IGHV genes, namely IGHV4-39. These results suggest the need for a close monitoring and a careful biopsy policy in patients with molecular, phenotypic and clinical predictors of RS identified at the time of CLL diagnosis.",
