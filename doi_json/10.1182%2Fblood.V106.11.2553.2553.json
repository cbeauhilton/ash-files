    "abstract_text": "Bortezomib (Velcade\u2122) is an effective treatment for advanced multiple myeloma (MM). The association of Velcade\u2122 to standard MP significantly increased response rate.When combined with Thalidomide, Velcade\u2122 showed additive activity. Based on these observations, a phase II multicenter trial of Velcade\u2122 plus Melphalan, Prednisone and Thalidomide (V-MPT) as salvage treatment was conducted. This is a dose escalation study with three sequential dose levels of Velcade\u2122. The V-MPT regimen included 6 five-week courses of oral Melphalan (6 mg/m 2 on days 1\u20135), Prednisone (60 mg/m 2 on days 1\u20135), Thalidomide (100 mg continuously). In the first cohort Velcade\u2122 at 1 mg/m 2 was added on days 1, 4, 15, 22 of each course followed by a 13-day rest period. In the second and in the third cohort, Velcade\u2122 was administered at 1.3 mg/m 2 and 1.6 mg/m 2 , respectively. DLT was defined as the occurrence in the first 2 courses of any grade 3\u20134 non hematological toxicities, a grade 4 neutropenia \u2265 a week, or any grade 4 hematological toxicity except neutropenia. Velcade\u2122 dose increment was implemented whenever at least 3 patients (pts) completed 2 courses without any DLT. As of July 2005, 20 pts have been enrolled in this study, median age 65 years (range 38\u201373), 65% IgG, 20% IgA, 15% Bence Jones. The median b2 microglobulin was 3.83 mg/L (range 0.5\u201313.8). Nine pts received V-MPT as second line therapy, 11 as third line. Fourteen patients received prior autologous transplant, 5 conventional chemotherapy and 4 thalidomide-based regimens. In the first 10 pts cohort, 3 DLT were observed in the first 2 courses (grade 3 pneumonia at cycle 1, grade 3 febrile neutropenia at cycle 1 and grade 3 vasculitis at cycle 2). Treatment was discontinued in pts who experienced pneumonia and vasculitis. Velcade\u2122 was reduced to 0.7 mg/m 2 in patient who experienced febrile neutropenia. Grade 3 hematological toxicities included thrombocytopenia (3 pts) and neutropenia (5 pts). The most common grade 1\u20132 toxicities were: constipation, infections, rash. In the second cohort, five of the 10 pts completed at least 2 cycles. Two DLT in the first 2 courses were observed (grade 3 Herpes Zoster infections). Grade 3 hematological toxicities included thrombocytopenia (1 pt) and neutropenia (1 pt). The most common grade 1\u20132 toxicities were: constipation, infections, fatigue. After introduction of prophylaxis with acyclovir, no new HZV reactivation was observed. Among the 6 pts with baseline peripheral neuropathy before V-MPT treatment, 4 pts remained stable, and 2 worsened (grade 2). Treatment-related (grade 1) neuropathy developed de novo in 2 pts. After a median of 3 courses (range 2\u20136) and a median follow-up of 5 months, 10 pts (67%) had a response \u2265 50%: 2 complete responses (CR), 1 near CR, 7 partial responses. Two pts (13%) achieved minor response (MR) and one stable disease. One pt experienced progressive disease after a MR and one was refractory to treatment. Initial results showed that V-MPT is a promising regimen for advanced myeloma. Further investigation is ongoing to determine the maximum tolerated dose of this combination. Updated results will be presented at the meeting."
