    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Myelofibrosis (MF) is a clonal stem cell disorder that originates from acquired mutations in the hematopoietic stem cells leading to abnormal kinase signaling, cell proliferation, cytokine expression, and splenomegaly and ultimately bone marrow (BM) fibrosis. Primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythemia vera (PV) MF and post-essential thrombocythemia MF are categorized under MF with overlapping disease phenotypes including progression to BM fibrosis. A genetic mutation in Janus kinase 2 ( V617F ) was identified as causative in ~95% PV, and ~50% of ET and PMF patients. Currently, treatment of MF patients with a JAK2 inhibitor offers symptomatic benefit, but does not alter the natural history of the disease or improve BM fibrosis. It is known that TGF\u03b21 is a critical regulator of fibrosis in many disease states. Elevated TGF\u03b21 levels were reported to be important for fibrosis in patients with MF. We hypothesize that inhibition of TGF\u03b21 signaling may prevent fibrosis and help reduce secondary morbidities associated with disease in MF patients. Therefore, we evaluated this hypothesis using a TGF\u03b21 antagonist in a murine model of MF. Methods: Transgenic JAK2 ( V617F ) mutant mice (MF model) and age-matched wild-type controls were used in the studies. Mice were dosed twice weekly with TGF\u03b21 antagonist (10 mg/kg). Complete blood counts (CBC), serum TGF\u03b21, bone metabolism and inflammatory cytokines levels were determined at different ages (2-12 months) during disease progression. Bone marrow and spleen cells were analyzed for different cell lineages by flow cytometry. Tissue sections were stained with H&E and reticulin to determine cellularity or degree of fibrosis respectively. Results: To understand the onset and progression of MF disease in JAK2 ( V617F ) mice, we initially analyzed the CBC and degree of fibrosis at various ages (2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10 and 12 months) and compared the data with wild-type mice. These data were then correlated with the levels of TGF\u03b21 and other cytokines. As expected, red blood cells (RBC) and platelets were elevated in JAK2 mutant mice at all ages compared to wild-type mice, although a trend towards a progressive increase was observed between 2 to 5 months followed by a decrease from 8 to 14 months. Bone marrow fibrosis was detected starting at 5 months and worsened with age. JAK2 mutant mice displayed splenomegaly that increased as the disease progressed. Interestingly, serum levels of TGF\u03b21, TGF\u03b23 and bone metabolism cytokines (OPG, OPN, aFGF and Trance) displayed an increase at earlier ages (2-5 months) compared to the latter ages, a trend similar to RBC levels. These levels peaked during the initiation of fibrosis at 5 months. In contrast, inflammatory cytokines (such as IL6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF\u03b1) were elevated at later ages consistent with disease progression. We initiated treatment with TGF\u03b21 antagonist in JAK2 ( V617F ) mice (N=8/treatment group) at 4 months of age, the age corresponding to elevated serum TGF\u03b21 levels and prior to the onset of fibrosis (at 5 months of age). Following 6 months of treatment, vehicle (VEH) treated JAK2 mutant mice displayed elevated RBC (+37.1%, P<0.001), platelets (+74.5%, P<0.001) and spleen weights (+9.5 fold, P<0.001) compared to wild-type mice. BM and spleen sections from VEH treated JAK2 mutant mice revealed severe fibrosis. TGF\u03b21 antagonist treatment of JAK2 mice displayed moderate effect on RBC (-8.4%, N.S) without any effect on platelet counts compared to VEH treatment. Flow-cytometry identified a reduced proportion of Ter119 + erythroid precursors in BM and spleen (-15%, P<0.05) and no change in CD41 + megakaryocytes. TGF\u03b21 antagonist treated mice displayed reduced spleen weights (-29%, P<0.01), and marked reduction in fibrosis in bone marrow (Figure) and spleen sections compared to VEH. Consistent with the reduction in fibrosis, TGF\u03b21 antagonist treated JAK2 mice displayed reduced IL-6 levels (-48.9%, P<0.05) compared to VEH treatment. Conclusion: Together, these data demonstrated that TGF\u03b21 levels were correlated with bone marrow fibrosis in a murine model of MF disease, and its inhibition using TGF\u03b2 antagonist reduces fibrosis, splenomegaly and inflammation in this murine model of myelofibrosis.
