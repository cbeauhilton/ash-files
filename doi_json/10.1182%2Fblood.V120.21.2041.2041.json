    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2041 Introduction: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) following reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) using fludarabine (FLU) and busulfan (BU) is a treatment option for heavily pretreated or comorbid patients. There is limited published experience with this approach in patients aged \u226565 years, and the influence of patient age on outcome remains to be evaluated. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 79 consecutive adult patients (median age 60 years, range 30\u201374, f=34, m=45) after allogeneic HCT using FLU (30 mg/m 2 , day -6 to -2) and BU (0.8 mg/kg q 6 hrs from day -4 to -2) for RIC at our institution from 2005 to 2012. Antithymocyte globulin, calcineurin inhibitor combined with mycophenolate mofetil (n=18) or methotrexate (n=61) were used as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. For statistical analysis, patients were grouped in 2 age categories: Patients <65 years (group A, n=59, median age 57 years) and patients \u226565 years (group B, n=20, median age 67 years). Results: Diagnoses were acute myeloid leukemia (AML, A=22, B=10), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, A=14, B=6) and myeloproliferative disease (MPD, A=23, B=4). At time of HCT, 34% of patients in A and 50% in B were in complete remission ( p =0.20). Grafts either from matched related (MRD, A=13, B=1), matched unrelated (MUD, A=21, B=8) or mismatched unrelated (MMUD, A=25, B=11) donors were used. In all patients, grafts consisted of G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (median CD34+ cells/kg, A=6.0\u00d710 6 , B=7.4\u00d710 6 , p =0.52). CMV disparity was equally distributed between both groups ( p =0.39). Median time to neutrophil count >500/\u03bcl was 21 days in group A and 20 days in group B ( p =0.24). Median time to platelet recovey >20,000/\u03bcl was 18 days in group A and 16 days in group B ( p =0.36). Complete donor chimerism in peripheral blood was established in group A and B after a median of 45 and 34 days, respectively ( p =0.11). Because of mixed chimerism or relapse after HCT, 21 patients (A=16, B=5, p =0.85) received CD3+ donor lymphocyte infusions (A: median 10\u00d710 6 /kg, range 1\u2013140\u00d710 6 /kg; B: median 13\u00d710 6 /kg, range 3\u2013177\u00d710 6 /kg; p =0.77) after a median of 131 and 119 days, respectively ( p =0.64). Current overall survival (OS) is 44/79 patients with a median follow-up of 818 days (range 53\u20132386) of patients alive resulting in a Kaplan-Meier estimated 3-year event-free survival (EFS) and OS of 42% and 52%, respectively. Although not statistically significant, AML was associated with an adverse outcome (3-year OS 37% compared to 60% for MDS, p =0.19 and 63% for MPS, p =0.09). The use of a related donor was not superior to an unrelated donor (3-year OS 49% compared to 44% for MUD, p =0.48 and 57% for MMUD, p =0.72). For the whole cohort, complete donor chimerism in peripheral blood on day +100 was associated with an improved survival (3-year OS 76% vs. 38%, p =0.002). The elderly subgroup showed a similar outcome compared to the younger patients (3-year OS in A 44% vs. 53% in B, p =0.90). Cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) adjusted for relapse as competing risk was 23% in group A and 10% in group B at 3 years ( p =0.31). Cumulative incidence of relapse at 3 years with death due to NRM as competing risk was 34% in group A and 54% in group B ( p =0.61). Causes of death were relapse (A=13, B=6), sepsis (A=7, B=0), GVHD (A=3, B=1) and others (A=4, B=1). CMV reactivation after HCT occurred comparably in both groups (A=19, B=7, p =0.82). Incidence of acute GVHD\u22652 was similar in group A and B (10% vs. 15%, p =0.56) and had no significant influence on survival of the whole cohort (3-year OS 60% vs. 51%, p=0.94). Incidence of chronic GVHD was 41% in A (limited=15, extensive=9) and 55% in B (limited=8, extensive=3) ( p =0.27). Analyzing the whole cohort, extensive chronic GVHD (3-year OS 31%) showed a trend towards an adverse outcome compared to limited (3-year OS 57%, p =0.07) or absent (3-year OS 55%, p =0.22) chronic GVHD. Conclusion: RIC with FLU/BU for allogeneic HCT is an important treatment option in the elderly patient population. Age itself has no negative impact on survival. Complete donor chimerism on day +100 is associated with an improved OS. Disclosures: Off Label Use: Conditioning in elderly patients.",
