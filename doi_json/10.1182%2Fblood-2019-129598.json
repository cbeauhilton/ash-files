    "abstract_text": "Background: Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are the standard of care in patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but the survival of patients after failure of HMA therapy is poor at approximately 4 to 6 months. Expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was increased in CD34 positive cells from patients with MDS with further upregulation following HMA therapy and HMA failure (Yang H, Leukemia 2014). Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting PD-1, thus blocking its interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. A phase Ib, multicohort study of pembrolizumab in advanced hematologic malignancies showed a small number of patients with long-term survival and no immune-mediated adverse events in the higher-risk MDS cohort (Garcia-Manero G, Blood 2016). We report updated results from an ongoing phase II clinical trial evaluating the safety and clinical activity of azacitidine and pembrolizumab in patients with higher-risk MDS. Methods: Adult patients with intermediate-1- or higher-risk disease by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) with adequate renal and hepatic function and no prior stem cell transplantation, active autoimmune disease, or immunodeficiencies were eligible for the study. Patients were divided into two cohorts: those who were treatment-na\u00efve and those who had not responded to, progressed on, or relapsed after HMA therapy. Patients received azacitidine 75 mg/m 2 intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously daily for 7 days every 28-day cycle and pembrolizumab 200 mg IV starting on cycle 1 day 1 and every 21 days thereafter independent of the azacitidine dosing schedule. The endpoints were overall response rate, survival, and safety. The criteria for early trial termination included an overall response rate (ORR) < 20%, incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) > 30%, poor adherence to protocol and regulatory requirements, severe and adverse drug reactions, and plans to modify or discontinue development of the study drug. Clinical trial information: NCT03094637. Results: At data cut-off (July 2019), 35 patients have been enrolled and 30 patients treated with combination azacitidine and pembrolizumab with a median follow-up time of 10.7 months and 10 patients continuing on treatment in cycles 1-16. Twenty patients were enrolled in the HMA failure cohort and 10 patients in the treatment-na\u00efve MDS cohort. Overall responses rates were 30% in the HMA failure cohort and 70% in the HMA therapy-na\u00efve cohort. In the HMA failure cohort, 2 patients achieved complete remission (CR), 2 patients attained marrow CR (mCR), and 2 patients showed hematological improvement of platelets (HI-P). In the previously untreated MDS cohort, 2 patients reached CR, 2 patients had mCR, 2 patients exhibited mCR with HI-P, and 1 patient demonstrated HI-P. The most frequently observed mutations in the 13 responding patients were ASXL1 and TET2 in 4 patients each and DNMT3A and TP53 in 3 patients each. Six of the responders had normal cytogenetics, 1 had del(20q), and 2 had complex karyotype. Overall survival was 5.9 months in the HMA failure cohort and 12.9 months in the HMA na\u00efve cohort. Treatment was overall well-tolerated. The most common treatment-related adverse events (all grades) were neutropenia (37%), myalgias/arthralgias (20%), constipation (17%), and elevated alanine aminotransferase levels and injection site reactions (13%) . Three patients died in the first 60 days while receiving treatment from the unrelated causes of cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation, septic shock and multiorgan failure, and fungal pneumonia. Conclusions: In this ongoing phase II trial, preliminary data suggest that azacitidine and pembrolizumab was relatively safe and well-tolerated. Combination therapy may have antitumor activity in patients who failed HMA, though no significant improvement in overall survival was observed.
