    "abstract_text": "The IL-3 receptor regulates myeloid cell survival and proliferation and is overexpressed on AML blasts and CD34+CD38- AML \u201cstem-like\u201d cells suggesting it plays a role in leukemic cell survival that could be exploited by targetted therapy. We have previously shown that Serine 585 in the cytoplasmic domain of the beta subunit of the IL-3 receptor is phosphorylated in response to sub-picomolar concentrations of cytokine, binds 14-3-3 zeta adaptor and is required for cytokine mediated survival (Guthridge et al, 2006 , EMBO ). We wished to examine the phosphorylation status of this receptor in AML blasts from patients and the expression levels of downstream Ser585 target genes. Results: We show that Ser585 of the beta common subunit is constitutively phosphorylated in the majority of leukaemic patients regardless of Flt3 status or cytogenetics (18/21 patients). In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor is not deregulated and remains cytokine-dependent (20/21). We have identified a panel of 139 Ser585-regulated genes by microarray (WT receptor vs Ser to Gly mutant) and show that a specific subset of these genes is deregulated in AML blasts confirmed by RT-PCR compared to normal mononuclear cells consistent with constitutive activation of this pathway in AML. We have identified a 4-gene signature that is a molecular correlate of the Ser585-survival pathway in AML. We further identify Ser585-regulated genes that are prognostic indicators of clinical outcome in a cohort of adult patients AML (n=33) independent of WCC or cytogenetic abnormalities. Targetting Ser585 survival genes using siRNA or blocking mAbs induces apoptosis in AML blasts validating Ser585-regulated genes as potential targets for therapy. Conclusions: Given the emerging problem of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and limited success of Flt3 inhibitors in AML, new strategies for therapy are needed. By interrogating a cytokine survival pathway that functions independently of tyrosine phosphorylation we have uncovered novel Ser585 gene targets with promising clinical utility in leukaemia.",
