    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1502 Poster Board I-525 Studies with human and mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have shown that a common precursor to both vascular (endothelial and smooth muscle cells) and hematopoietic cell lineages called the hemangioblast can be produced from ESC-derived embryoid bodies in culture. We have developed a simple strategy to efficiently and reproducibly generate hemangioblasts from multiple hESC lines under serum- and stromal-free conditions, which will be important for their productive use in regenerative medicine. Previous work has shown that hESC-derived hemangioblasts can effectively differentiate into erythroid and myeloid lineages, but their ability to produce lymphoid lineage cells, including those with immunotherapeutic potential, is relatively unknown. Natural killer (NK) cells, which are part of the innate immune system, provide rapid, non-specific responses against viral infection and are involved in tumor cell detection and elimination. Interplay between various activating and inhibitory signals control the three main functions of NK cells, which are cytokine release, natural cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Using hemangioblasts generated from both H7 and HuES-3 hESC lines, we have been able to produce mature CD56 low/\u2212 CD16 + NK cells and found that their production does not require the use of stromal feeder layers. The differentiation procedure involves an initial 4 day culture to generate embryoid bodies, followed by a 12-14 day culture in methylcellulose supplemented with a set of cytokines and growth factors for the production and expansion of a hemangioblastic population. An additional 14-17 days in liquid culture plus human serum and a cocktail of cytokines allows for the differentiation of NK cells as assessed by flow cytometry. A non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay similar to the 51 Cr release assay shows that these hemangioblast-derived NK cells harbor natural cytotoxicity function as they are able to effectively induce apoptosis in target K562 erythroblastic leukemia cells after a standard 4 hr co-culture. Using hemangioblasts as an intermediary cell source may enhance the capability and/or efficiency of hESCs to differentiate in vitro and importantly, allow for the development of feeder-free systems for the production of cells with immunotherapeutic potential.
