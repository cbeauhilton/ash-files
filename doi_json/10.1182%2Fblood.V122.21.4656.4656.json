    "abstract_text": "Background Erythropoietin(EPO) response to anaemia has been reported to be suboptimal in HIV infected anaemic patients. Objectives To assess the relationship between EPO levels and degree of anaemia, CD4+ cell count and viral load of HIV infected treatment naive subjects and if there is any association with inflammatory cytokines. Subjects and Methods A total of 120 subjects aged 18-66 years, comprises (1) HIV infected treatment naive subjects who had anaemia with Hb level <10g/dL. Control subjects were: (2) HIV infected non-anaemic, (3) non-HIV infected anaemic and (4) non-HIV infected non-anaemic individuals. Full blood count using automated counter; CD4+ cell count by semi-automated flow cytometer; and viral load were estimated. Serum erythropoietin levels, serum ferritin levels, CRP levels, TNF-\u03b1 levels and IL-6 levels were estimated. Appropriateness of EPO response was determined by calculating EPO response ratio. Results Majority (72%) of the HIV infected anaemic patients had a normocytic hypochromic type of anaemia. A weak positive correlation between EPO levels and CD4+ cell count (r=0.075, p=0.572) was obtained. A significant negative correlation between EPO levels and haemoglobin levels (r=-0.268, p=0.003). Twenty-seven (71.05%) of the 38 HIV infected anaemic subjects had EPO response ratio less than 0.8. Serum ferritin level was significantly higher in HIV infected anaemic subjects compared to the controls (p=0.000). Serum interleukin-6 level was significantly higher in HIV infected anaemic subjects compared to HIV infected non-anaemic subjects (p=0.003). Serum C-reactive protein level was significantly higher in HIV infected anaemic subjects compared to non-HIV infected non-anaemic (p=0.004) and non-HIV infected anaemic subjects and(0.001). Serum tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 level was significantly higher in HIV infected anaemic subjects compared to other arms of the study population (p=0.000). Conclusion The present study revealed that HIV infected anaemic subjects had reduced serum EPO levels. However, serum inflammatory cytokines levels were raised in the same subjects.
