    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5129 Several generic versions of argatroban) (Mitsubishi; Tokyo, Japan) have been introduced in Japan (Argaron, Gartban, Slovastan). In addition, other generic versions of argatroban are being considered by the European and North American regulatory bodies. While the generic versions of argatroban exhibit similar antithrombin potency (Ki values), because of the differential compositional variations their anticoagulant effects in whole blood systems may differ due to their cellular and plasmatic protein interactions. Branded and generic versions of argatroban may exhibit differential anticoagulant actions in the whole blood and plasma based assays due to their differential interactions with blood cells, platelets and plasma proteins. Three generic versions of argatroban that are commercially available in Japan namely Argaron, Gartban and Slovastan and a powdered version of generic argatroban (Lundbeck) were compared with the branded argatroban. Native whole blood thrombelastographic (TEG) analysis was carried out at 0.1 ug/mL, the Activated Clotting Time (ACT) assay was carried out in a concentration range of 0\u201310 ug/mL, and such coagulation tests as the PT/INR, aPTT, Heptest, and calcium thrombin time were performed. Plasma retrieved from the supplemented whole blood was also assayed. Ratios of the clotting time test values from whole blood and plasma were calculated. Retrieved plasma samples were also assayed in the thrombin generation assays (TGA). All of the different versions of argatroban produced a concentration dependent anticoagulant effect in the native whole blood TEG and ACT. In the TEG, while argatroban and Slovastan showed a similar effect, Gartban, Argaron and a powdered generic showed weaker effects. Argatroban was also different in the ACT assay. At a concentration of 5 ug/ml the ACTs were, Arg 340+15.2 secs, S 297+10.5 secs, G 292.0+19.1 secs and A 285.2+21.7 secs. In the citrated whole blood systems, all agents produced a concentration dependent anticoagulant effect; however, the generic versions produced a stronger anticoagulant effect in comparison to branded argatroban (p<0.001). In the PT assay at 5 ug/mL, argatroban showed 32 \u00b1 3 sec vs 40\u201350 sec for the generic products. Similarly in the aPTT, Heptest and thrombin time tests argatroban was weaker than the generic products. Differences among generic versions were also evident. Similar results were obtained in the retrieved plasma, however the ratio of whole blood over plasma varied from product to product. The IC 50 of the generic and branded argatrobans in the TGA were also different. These results show that while in the thrombin inhibition assays generic and branded argatroban may show similar effects, these agents exhibit assay dependent differences in the whole blood and plasma based assays. Such differences may be more evident in the in vivo studirs where endothelial cells and other interactions may contribute to product individuality. Therefore, based on the in vitro antiprotease assays, generic argatrobans may not be considered equivalent and require a multi-parametric study. Currently available generic argatrobans may not be equivalent in the in vivo anticoagulant effects. Therefore, clinical validation of the clinical equivalence for these drugs is warranted.
