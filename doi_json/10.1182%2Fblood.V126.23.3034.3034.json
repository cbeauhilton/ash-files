    "abstract_text": "Background A lack of objective data exists on differences in treatment practices and outcomes for MM between countries. The EMMOS study aimed to document and describe current treatment regimens and disease progression patterns of MM pts at different stages of the disease in real-world medical practice. Methods Adult pts initiating any new MM therapy, irrespective of treatment line at study entry or therapy type received, were eligible for inclusion in the EMMOS registry. A multi-staged pt/site recruitment model was applied to minimize selection bias; enrollment was stratified by country, region, and practice type. Pts' medical/disease features, treatment history, and remission status were recorded at baseline. Prospective data on treatment, efficacy, and safety were collected electronically every 3 mos until 2 yrs after the last pt enrolled. Responses were investigator-assessed (no predefined criteria). Here we report data from the final analysis of EMMOS. Pts were grouped according to receipt of high-dose chemotherapy/stem cell transplantation in any treatment line (SCT pts, non-SCT pts). Within a given line, pts may have received induction, SCT, consolidation, and/or maintenance therapy; if multiple drug combinations were used within a line, the line grouping was based on the combination received in cycle 1. Results 2358 pts were enrolled between Oct 2010-Oct 2012 in 22 countries in Europe and Africa; the last pt completed follow-up in Oct 2014. Of these, 775 pts had undergone SCT in any treatment line. Baseline characteristics in the prospective phase by starting line are shown in the Table. As expected, there was a higher proportion of younger pts (\u226465 yrs) in the SCT vs non-SCT group across all treatment lines, and in both groups a higher proportion of pts in 4 th + vs earlier lines with ISS stage III disease. While cytogenetics were evaluated in a small number of pts overall (670/2358 [28%]), these assessments were performed significantly more frequently in SCT vs non-SCT pts (p<0.0001). In 380 prospective 1 st line (L1) SCT pts, 299 (79%) underwent SCT-based treatment in L1; induction was with a bortezomib (btz)-based combination in 83% (47% btz without immunomodulatory drug [IMiD]; 36% btz + IMiD), IMiD in 11%, and other (ie. no btz/IMiD) in 6%. In 81 SCT pts who received non-SCT-based treatment in L1 (21%), 36% received btz without IMiD, 40% other, and 17% IMiD-based combinations. In 345 pts receiving L2, most frequent therapies were btz without IMiD (45% of pts), IMiD without btz (30%), other (13%), and btz + IMiD (12%); non-btz/IMiD combinations were increasingly prevalent in pts receiving L3 or L4 (24% and 40%, respectively). In the non-SCT population, 58% of pts received a btz-based combination in L1, most frequently btz without IMiDs (54%). In pts receiving L2, btz or IMID were equally represented (39%); in L3, non-SCT pts were most likely to receive other therapies (39%) versus 27% btz without IMiD and 32% IMiD without btz. Based on preliminary data, mean EQ5D score at baseline was 0.316 (range -0.594, 0.731) in the overall pt population, which increased slightly to 0.410 (-0.429, 0.731) at 12 mos and was largely comparable between countries. Resource utilization (hospitalization, ICU, ER visit, outpatient visit, full-time care) appeared highest in Germany (67.6 records per pt) and lowest in Croatia (7.5 per pt), with those in Germany spending a mean of 12.1 days in hospital per stay. Efficacy/safety data will be presented at the meeting. Conclusion This large, real-world, observational study provides for the first time a comprehensive picture of the baseline characteristics and therapy of MM pts treated in Europe, the Middle-East, and Africa. These data provide a framework towards the design of future protocols aiming to improve outcomes in MM. Table. Baseline characteristics by starting line  . Non-SCT pts . SCT pts . L1 (n=897) .
