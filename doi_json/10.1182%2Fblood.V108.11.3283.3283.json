    "abstract_text": "Formation of inhibitory antibodies is a significant problem encountered in the treatment of hemophilia by replacement therapy. Nonviral gene transfer of a factor VIII plasmid into hemophilia mice induced strong humoral responses through predominantly TH2 signals. The plasmid-treated mice produced persistent, high-level inhibitory antibody specifically against FVIII, representing a unique and useful model for testing various immunomodulation strategies. It was previously demonstrated by our group that transient immunosuppression by CTLA4-Ig and anti-CD40L (MR1) can prevent inhibitory antibody formation following nonviral gene transfer of FVIII plasmid into hemophilia A mice. In this study, we tested if blockade of inducible costimulator (ICOS)-ICOS ligand (ICOSL) pathway in combination with or without agents blocking other co-stimulatory pathways can modulate the immune response following gene therapy treatment. Three groups of mice (n=5/group) were subjected to administration of FVIII plasmid via hydrodynamics-based tail-vein injection, and transient immunosuppressive regimens including anti-ICOS (8 treatment in 2 week period), combination of anti-ICOS (same dose) and CTLA4-Ig (2 treatment at day 0 and 2), and combination of anti-ICOS (same dose) and MR1 (5 treatment in 2 week period). 2 mice from anti-ICOS only group, 3 mice from combination treatment of anti-ICOS and CTLA4-Ig group, and 2 mice from combination treatment of anti-ICOS and MR1 group developed inhibitors at 2 weeks post treatment. The rest of the mice did not develop inhibitors. These results imply that neither synergistic nor additional modulation was achieved by combining CTLA4-Ig or MR1 with anti-ICOS compared to anti-ICOS alone. Subsequently a more frequent and longer anti-ICOS treatment (16 treatment in 4 week period) was administered in two separate groups of FVIII plasmid-treated mice (n=5 and 11 per group, respectively). All the treated mice did not produce inhibitory antibodies against FVIII and produced persistent, high-level (100\u2013300 \u03bcg/ml) FVIII gene expression for at least 150 days (experimental period). The CD4+ T cells isolated from the spleen of tolerized mice did not proliferate in response to FVIII stimulation in vitro. Furthermore, higher population of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells were detected in peripheral blood in the tolerized mice compared to untreated and plasmid-treated mice. Adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells isolated from tolerized mice is performed to test if these cells can protect the recipient mice from developing inhibitory antibodies against FVIII. Anti-ICOS treatment has the potential for a new immunomodulatory strategy for preventing the formation of inhibitory antibodies against FVIII following gene therapy."
