    "abstract_text": "We developed new ITD detection algorithm (ITDetect) based on whole exome sequencing (WES) data for FMS-like tyrosine kinase internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD). ITDetect is based on BWA and is specified for ITD detection including FLT3-ITD. We validated and compared result of ITDetect with other ITD detecting algorithms using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Nested PCR uses two types of primer specified for FLT3-ITD detection. In 81 acute myeloid leukemia patients with WES data, FLT3-ITD was positive in 11 patients (13%) when called with ITDetect, all of whom were validated with nested PCR. Meanwhile FLT3-ITD was positive only in 7/81 patients by conventional PCR. The concordance rate of ITDetect and nested PCR was 95% (77/81). ITDetect showed better ITD detection performance when compared with previously reported ITD callers. In large AML cohort (n=213), patients who were positive for FLT3-ITD with nested-PCR but not with conventional PCR had shorter survival outcomes than patients who were negative for FLT3-ITD with nested PCR, suggesting clinical significance of sensitive FLT3-ITD detection. In conclusion, we developed more sensitive detection methods for FLT3-ITD based on WES data that is clinically meaningful. Utilization of more sensitive detection method than conventional PCR in clinic should be considered. Figure View large Download slide FLT3-ITD detection procedure.
