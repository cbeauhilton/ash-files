    "abstract_text": "Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is an immunosuppressive lentivirus of domestic cats that serves as an animal model for the pathogenesis of CD4+ lymphopenia and thymus dysfunction in HIV infected humans. During most cases of adult and pediatric HIV infection, nai\u0308ve CD4+ T lymphocytes recognized by the expression of the RA isoform of the leukocyte common antigen (CD45RA) are infected at a lower level than memory CD4+ T\u2212 lymphocytes; however, children with rapidly progressive disease due to thymic insufficiency harbor high levels of HIV within the CD45RA+ subpopulation. In FIV infected cats, the fate of nai\u0308ve CD4 lymphocytes is unknown due to the lack of specific markers. Recently, a mAb (755) was reported to recognize the feline homologue to CD45RA, allowing the enumeration of nai\u0308ve CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes in cats. The purpose of this study was to characterize the fate of CD4+CD45RA+ blood cells eight weeks after FIV infection. One-day-old kittens (n=6) were infected with virions either from a wild type clone (JSY3) or mutant ORF-A clone at equivalent reverse transcriptase units and compared to historical control data. Eight weeks after inoculation, the percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ cells belonging to the CD45RA+ subpopulation were measured by two-color flow cytometry. Both FIV inocula were associated with a reduction in total CD4+ lymphocytes from a median of 13% in controls to 8% in infected cats (P=0.004), contributing to a reduction in the CD4:CD8 ratio from 2.45 in controls to 0.76 in infected cats (P=0.007). The decline in CD4+ lymphocytes was attributable to a disproportionate loss of CD4+CD45RA+ cells: 69% of CD4+ cells were CD45RA+ in controls, as compared to 7% in FIV infected cats (P=0.004). In contrast, nai\u0308ve CD8+ lymphocytes did not change significantly with FIV infection (67% of CD8+ cells were CD45RA+ in FIV infected cats as compared to 80% in controls). The distribution of CD45RA+ cells in the lymph nodes of FIV infected cats mirrored those in the blood. Together, these data suggest that acute FIV infection results in a rapid depletion of nai\u0308ve CD4 lymphocytes throughout the blood and secondary lymphoid tissues, while proportions of nai\u0308ve CD8 lymphocytes remain unchanged. CD4+CD45RA+ cells may be depleted during pediatric FIV infection through lytic infection or a transition to a memory phenotype lacking CD45RA.",
