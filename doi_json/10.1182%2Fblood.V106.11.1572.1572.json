    "abstract_text": "GX15-070 is a small-molecule antagonist of the BH3-binding groove of the Bcl-2 family of proteins and can thus induce apoptosis by inhibiting the interaction between pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. In addition, GX15-070 activates a cellular pathway, which leads to the activation of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Bim, a natural cellular inhibitor of anti-apoptotic members. Together, the direct inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and the activation of pro-apoptotic Bim by GX15-070 can sensitize tumor cells to apoptosis. Bcl-2 family members, particularly Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 have been implicated in the survival of myeloma cells and may be responsible, in part, for drug resistance. Consequently, GX15-070 was tested against the MMRC 12 validation cell line panel, a panel of 12 standardized and annotated human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs). Western blots preformed on 8 HMCLs confirmed expression of Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and/or Bcl-XL. Basal levels of Bcl-2 and MCl-1 were relatively similar across all HMCLs studied whereas levels of Bcl-XL were variable GX15-070 inhibited the viability of all 12 myeloma cell lines as determined by MTT assay. The mean IC50 was 215 nM; range (6.4-678nM) and sensitivity did not correlate with level of Bcl-2, MCL-1 or Bcl-XL expression. On the other hand cytotoxicity to normal human blood lymphocytes, stroma and bone marrow CFUs was not observed at concentrations which were effectively cytotoxic to HMCL. Time course experiments demonstrate that apoptosis and cleavage of caspase 3 began by 12 hours and continued to increase over a 96 hour period. Co-culture with human bone marrow stroma cells (BMSCs) failed to protect HMCL from GX15-070 induced cytotoxicity. Similarly, potent MM growth factors, Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1 did not confer resistance to GX15-070. Of interest, overexpression of Bcl-2 has been shown to attenuate PS-341-induced cell death (Mitisades); however, the combination of PS-341 and GX15-070 did not reveal synergistic interaction in preliminary results. Studies looking at other drug combinations are planned. Finally, GX15-070 produced cytotoxic responses in the first primary myeloma sample tested with further testing ongoing. Mouse xenograft studies are also ongoing and will be presented. These studies indicate extensive pre-clinical activity of GX15-070 in multiple myeloma and set the stage for planned Phase II clinical trials.",
