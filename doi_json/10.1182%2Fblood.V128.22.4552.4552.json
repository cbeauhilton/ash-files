    "abstract_text": "Hallmarks of effective adoptive T cell therapy include: 1) the ability to access and expand T cells of interest 2) measurable anti-tumor efficacy of these cells upon reinfusion and 3) T cell persistence over time. In examining the long-term follow-up of patients treated with MILs, we show evidence of persistence of adoptively transferred MILs for over five years post transfer. In a clinical trial conducted in 2007, Prevnar na\u00efve myeloma patients were immunized against the modified diphtheria toxin, CRM197 with the Prevnar vaccine administered 2 weeks prior to collecting marrow infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs) from bone marrow. Patients received a CD34-selected (T cell depleted) autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) and had activated and expanded MILs infused 3 days later. As such, 99% of infused T cells were Prevnar-primed, ex vivo expanded MILs. This approach enabled us to track the fate of the non gene-modified MILs by examining CRM197 specific T cells. As originally reported, persistence at one year of both CRM197 and myeloma antigen-specific T cells correlated with clinical responses. 1 Long-term follow up was performed in a subset of the patients that had undergone bone marrow biopsies for clinical purposes. The results showed that patients who had been in a complete response at the end of the clinical trial maintained a greater number of both CRM197 and myeloma antigen-specific T cells over time for up to 7 years after the clinical trial. Patients who did not achieve a complete response and subsequently relapsed showed a loss of both CRM197 as well as myeloma antigen- specific T cells in most cases. Considering that the patients received a T cell depleted stem cell graft, the CRM197-specific T cells that were measured were likely a result of the Prevnar-primed MILs. From these results, we conclude that: 1) adoptively transferred CRM-197 specific MILs showed persistence up 7 years following their infusion. 2) the magnitude of CRM197 and myeloma antigen-specific T cell responses correlated with clinical responsiveness. Taken together, these data demonstrate several unique attributes of MILs which are critical for successful adoptive T cell therapy Adoptive transfer of activated marrow-infiltrating lymphocytes induces measurable antitumor immunity in the bone marrow in multiple myeloma.
