    "abstract_text": "Background: An abnormal free light chain (FLC) indicating the presence of excess monoclonal FLC is associated with an increased risk of progression of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) to multiple myeloma (MM) or related disorder. In addition, the risk of progression rises with increasingly abnormal FLC ratio, suggesting that the mechanism for markedly abnormal FLC ratios may be different compared to ratios closer to normal range. We hypothesized that as in light chain MM (in which IgH expression is completely lost), a more markedly abnormal FLC ratio is a marker for IgH translocations (TCs) involving 14q32. We tested this hypothesis using data obtained from gene expression profiling (GEP) to identify the presence of specific IgH TCs and correlating them to serum FLC ratio. Methods: We examined data from 128 GEPs from pts with MM (92), smoldering MM (13), MGUS (9) and primary amyloidosis (14). Presence of IgH translocations were identified using the specific probes for the partner chromosome TC sites, namely FGFR3/MMSET (4p16), cyclin D3 (6p21), cyclin D1 (11q13), c-maf (16q23), and mafB (20q12) as previously described. FLC estimation was carried out on stored serum samples from these patients using the serum FLC assay (FreeliteH, The Binding Site Limited, UK) performed on a Dade-Behring Nephelometer. Based on the established reference range, kappa/lambda FLC ratio 1.65 were defined as abnormal indicating the presence of monoclonal lambda and kappa FLC, respectively. The monoclonal LC isotype was considered the involved FLC isotype, and the opposite LC type as the uninvolved FLC type. Differential expression of genes was examined using Genespring 7.2 software. Results: Among the 92 pts with MM, 36 (42%) had evidence of one of the 5 primary IgH TCs: 20 pts with 11q13 (22%), 7 pts with 4p16 (8%), 4 pts with16q23 (4%), 3 pts with 20q12 (3%), and 2 patients with 6p21 (2%). Among the 11 pts with MM with an FLC ratio of > 1000, 8 (72%) had an IgH TC. The proportion of pts with an FLC ratio >1000 was significantly higher in pts with an IgH TCcompared to those without, 22% vs 5% respectively, P=0.02. The mean FLC ratio was 1728 (range; 1.6 to 31,008) in patients with an IgH TC vs. 412 (1\u201311340) for those without IgH TCs, P=0.09. Similarly in pts with MGUS, SMM or AL all three pts with a ratio > 50 had evidence of an IgH translocation. compared to 14/33 with lower ratio. The mean FLC ratio was 29 (range;1 to 209) in pts with an IgH TC vs. 9.1 (1\u201341) for those without IgH TCs, P=0.1. We correlated the results of FISH tests where available (122 of 128 pts) to determine the ability of GEP to identify IgH TCs. IgH translocation identified by the GEP could be detected on FISH in 42 of 47 patients (89%). Correspondingly, 61 of 75 patients (81%) without an IgH translocation on GEP had a similar result by FISH as well. We compared the GEP of MM pts with FLC ratio of >500 to the rest and identified 34 genes which were 2 fold differentially expressed between the two groups. Conclusion: By combining GEP data and serum FLC measurements, we show that very high FLC ratios is associated with IgH translocations. However, the correlation is not absolute, likely reflecting that markedly abnormal FLC ratios may be mediated through other mechanisms including increasing tumor load. To further explore this we analyzed differentially expressed genes between patients with high and low ratios and identified a set of 34 genes, which are currently being studied further.",
