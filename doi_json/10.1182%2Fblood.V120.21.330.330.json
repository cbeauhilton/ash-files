    "abstract_text": "Abstract 330 Background: Our previous study demonstrated that inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) acts by severely depleting intracellular NAD+ content and thus eliciting mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagic MM cell death. The proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib induces anti-MM activity by affecting a variety of signaling pathways. However, as with other agents, dose-limiting toxicities and the development of resistance limit its long-term utility. Here, we demonstrate that combining Nampt inhibitor and bortezomb induces synergistic anti-MM cell death both in vitro using MM cell lines or patient CD138+ MM cells and in vivo in a human plasmacytoma xenograft mouse model. Material and Methods: We utilized MM.1S, MM.1R, RPMI-8226, and U266 human MM cell lines, as well as purified tumor cells from patients relapsing after prior therapies. Cell viability and apoptosis assays were performed using Annexin V/PI staining. Intracellular NAD+ level and proteasome activity were quantified after 12, 24, and 48h exposure to single/combination drugs by specific assays. In vitro angiogenesis was assessed by Matrigel capillary-like tube structure formation assay. Immunoblot analysis was performed using antibodies to caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, PARP, Bcl-2, and tubulin. CB-17 SCID male mice (n = 28; 7 mice/EA group) were subcutaneously inoculated with 5.0 \u00d7 10 6 MM.1S cells in 100 microliters of serum free RPMI-1640 medium. When tumors were measurable (3 weeks after MM cell injection), mice were treated for three weeks with vehicle alone, FK866 (30mg/kg 4 days weekly), Bortezomib (0.5 mg/kg twice weekly), or FK866 (30 mg/kg) plus Bortezomib (0.5 mg/kg). Statistical significance of differences observed in FK866, Bortezomib or combination-treated mice was determined using a Student t test. Isobologram analysis was performed using \u201cCalcuSyn\u201d software program. A combination index < 1.0 indicates synergism. Results/Discussion: Combining FK866 and Bortezomib induces synergistic anti-MM activity in vitro against MM cell lines (P<0.005, CI < 1) or patient CD138-positive MM cells (P< 0.004). FK866 plus Bortezomib-induced synergistic effect is associated with: 1)activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP; 2) improved intracellular NAD+ dissipation; 3) suppression of chymotrypsin-like, caspase-like, and trypsin-like proteolytic activities; 4) inhibition of NF-kappa B signaling; and 5) inhibition of angiogenesis. Importantly, the ectopic overexpression of Nampt rescues this observed synergistic effect; conversely, Nampt knockdown by RNAi significantly enhances the anti-MM effect of bortezomib. In the murine xenograft MM model, low dose combination FK866 (30 mg/kg) and Bortezomib (0.5 mg/kg) is well tolerated, significantly inhibits tumor growth (P < 0.001), and prolongs host survival (2\u20132.5 months in mice receiving combined drugs, P = 0.001). These findings demonstrate that intracellular NAD+ levels represent a major determinant in the ability of bortezomib to induce apoptosis of MM cells, providing the rationale for clinical protocols evaluating FK866 together with Bortezomib to improve patient outcome in MM.
