    "abstract_text": "FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD are the most frequent tyrosine kinase mutations in AML, with the former strongly associated with a poor prognosis. We have recently revealed that FLT3-ITD confers resistance to the PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors by protecting the mTOR/4EBP1/Mcl-1 pathway through STAT5 activation in AML. The proteasomal inhibitor bortezomib (BZM) has recently been reported as a promising agent for treatment of AML. We examine here the molecular mechanisms involved in induction of apoptosis by BZM in hematopoietic cells, including AML cells, and evaluate the effects of FLT3-ITD and TKD on these mechanisms and on the sensitivity of cells to BZM-induced apoptosis. We first comparatively examined the effect of BZM on survival of hematopoietic 32D cells and human leukemic UT7 cells driven by FLT3-ITD (32D/ITD and UT7/ITD) or FLT3-D835Y (32D/TKD and UT7/TKD). BZM induced activation of Bax, decline in mitochondrial membrane potential, and activation of caspase-9, thus leading to apoptosis, more conspicuously in cells driven by FLT3-ITD than FLT3-TKD. These results indicate that FLT3-ITD, as compared with FLT3-TKD, conferred resistance to apoptosis induced by BZM through the intrinsic pathway in these cells. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in BZM-induced apoptosis in these cells, we next examined the effect of BZM on expression levels of FLT3 in these cells as well as in human leukemic MV4-11 cells expressing FLT3-ITD. Intriguingly, treatment of these cells with BZM conspicuously reduced expression levels of FLT3. It was further reveled that BZM further facilitated the decline in FLT3-ITD expression in MV4-11 cells treated with actinomycin D to shut down the transcriptional activity. Furthermore, BZM significantly retarded the recovery of FLT3-ITD expression in MV4-11 cells washed out from the translation inhibitor cycloheximide. These results suggest that BZM may downregulate the FLT3-ITD expression mainly at the translational level. However, we did not observe any significant difference in extent of the BZM-induced decline in expression levels between FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD. We next examined the effect of BZM on the mTOR/4EBP1 pathway, which we have shown to play important roles in regulation of apoptosis downstream of FLT3-ITD. It was found that BZM downregulated this pathway more significantly in 32D/TKD cells than in 32D/ITD cells. Because we have also previously found that STAT5 activated robustly by FLT3-ITD plays an important role in modulation of the mTOR/4EBP1 pathway, we examined the effects of BZM on 32D/TKD cells forced to express the constitutively activated STAT5 mutant, STAT5A1*6. As expected, STAT5A1*6 conferred resistance to BZM-induced downregulation of the mTOR/4EBP1 pathway as well as apoptosis in 32D/TKD cells. Consistent with this, the STAT5 inhibitor pimozide, clinically in use for neuropsychiatric disorders, abrogated the resistance of 32D/ITD, UT7/ITD, and MV4-11 cells to BZM-induced inhibition of the mTOR/4EBP1 pathway and apoptosis. We finally examined the possible involvement of the STAT5 target gene product Pim-1 in acquisition of resistance to BZM by cells expressing FLT3-ITD. We fist confirmed that Pim-1 was expressed at a higher level in 32D/ITD cells than in 32D/TKD cells and that STAT5A1*6 increased the expression level of Pim-1 in 32D/TKD cells. We then examined the effects of a specific Pim kinase inhibitor, AZD-1208, and found that it synergistically downregulated the mTOR/4EBP1 pathway and induced apoptosis with BZM in 32D/ITD cells as well as 32D/TKD cells expressing STAT5A1*6. We also examined the effects of a BET bromodomain inhibitor, JQ1, which has recently been shown to inhibit the STAT5 activity and to reduce specifically the expression level of Pim-1 as well as c-Myc in MV4-11 cells. As expected, pretreatment of 32D/ITD or MV4-11 cells with JQ1 conspicuously sensitized these cells to BZM-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that BZM downregulates FLT3 expression and the mTOR/4EBP1 pathway to activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and that robust STAT5 activation by FLT3-ITD confers resistance to BZM on AML cells through protection of the mTOR/4EBP1 pathway at least partly by inducing Pim-1 expression. The present study may contribute to development of novel therapeutic strategies against FLT3-ITD-positive AML by combined use of BZM and the STAT5/Pim-1 pathway inhibitors.
