    "abstract_text": "Deficiencies in DNA repair-related genes such RecQ DNA helicases lead to human genetic disorders such as Bloom\u2019s syndrome, Werner\u2019s syndrome, and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome characterized by premature aging and cancer predisposition. We hypothesized that deficiency in RecQ DNA helicases may lead to drug hypersensitivity and/or stem cell failure after serial transplantation. Several genotoxic agents were tested on the bone marrow cells isolated from Bloom (Blm) \u2212 / \u2212 and RecQ4 \u2212 / \u2212 knockout mice and compared to wildtype bone marrow cells. RecQ4 \u2212 / \u2212 bone marrow showed mild sensitivity to \u03b3-ray irradiation and very mild sensitivity to cisplatin. RecQ4 \u2212 / \u2212 bone marrow did not show sensitivity to etoposide. However, Blm \u2212 / \u2212 bone marrow cells did not show hypersensitivity to either \u03b3-ray irradiation or etoposide treatment, implying each RecQ DNA helicase may have different roles for DNA repair and/or proliferation in bone marrow cells. To assess how deficiency in RecQ DNA helicase affects hematopoietic stem cell function, serial transplantation capacity into lethally irradiated recipients was compared between bone marrow cells isolated from Blm \u2212 / \u2212 (Ly5.2) and wildtype (Ly5.1) mice. Competitive repopulating capacity was monitored by Ly5.1 / Ly5.2 marker analysis of peripheral blood every three weeks. There was no difference in early repopulating capacity between Blm \u2212 / \u2212 and wildtype in primary transplants at 3, 6 and 9 weeks post-transplantation (wt 46.6% \u00b1 11.9% vs. Blm \u2212 / \u2212 53.5% \u00b1 11.9%, n=6, p=0.33 at 9 weeks post-transplantation). However, at 15 weeks post-transplantation, Blm \u2212 / \u2212 cells showed higher repopulation than wildtype bone marrow cells (wt 30.7 % \u00b1 7.1 % vs. Blm \u2212 / \u2212 69.3% \u00b1 7.1%, n=3, p=0.003), implying Blm \u2212 / \u2212 cells might gradually accumulate a proliferative advantage over wildtype cells. To assess whether drug treatment may cause sensitivity in Blm \u2212 / \u2212 cells after transplantation, primary recipients of an equal mixture of Blm \u2212 / \u2212 and wildtype bone marrow were treated with 1 mg/kg cisplatin biweekly i.p. between 9 to 15 weeks post-transplantation and repopulation capacity was monitored. The repopulation advantage of Blm \u2212 / \u2212 cells in primary transplants was abolished by cisplatin treatment (wt 61.3 % \u00b1 17.3 % vs. Blm \u2212 / \u2212 38.7% \u00b1 17.3%, n=3, p=0.19, in the cisplatin-treated cohort compared to wt 30.7 % \u00b1 7.1 % vs. Blm \u2212 / \u2212 69.3% \u00b1 7.1%, n=3, p=0.003, in the control cohort). Thus, a proliferative advantage of progenitors is apparent in Blm \u2212 / \u2212 bone marrow, but lost after cisplatin-mediated DNA damage. This suggests that defective DNA repair of Blm \u2212 / \u2212 cell may promote deregulated proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors."
