    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3006 Poster Board II-982 P2Y12 inhibitors decrease the reactivity of platelets. Since the P2Y12 receptor acts through G\u03b1ai-induced signals, which inhibit adenyl cyclase, P2Y12 inhibitors are thought to act through phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA) substrates. One PKA substrate is serine166 (S166) of GPIb\u03b2. Using a phospho-specific antibody, Western blots, and FACS of whole blood, we found that ADP and epinephrine, which activate P2Y12 receptors caused a dose-dependent dephosphorylation of S166 while apyrase and a P2Y12 inhibitor prevented this dephosphorylation. Since S166 functions with S609 of GPIb\u03b1a to bind 14-3-3, we determined whether i) dephosphorylation was associated with release of 14-3-3 from GPIb, and ii) 14-3-3 regulated \u03b1aIIb\u03b23 function. GPIb bound \u223c91 \u00b1 5% of the 14-3-3, as determined by its insolubility in streptolysin O-permeabilized platelets and its solubilization by phospho-S609 and -S166 peptides. Quantitation of 14-3-3 in GPIb immunoprecipitates showed that graded G\u03b1ai-induced dephosphorylation of S166 was accompanied by graded release of 14-3-3 from GPIb. Evidence that 14-3-3 participates in \u03b1aIIb\u03b23 signaling came from its co-immunoprecipitation with \u03b1aIIb\u03b23 from sheared platelets. Moreover, when CHO/\u03b1aIIb\u03b23 cell 14-3-3 was sequestered by expression of GPIb, \u03b1aIIb\u03b23-induced activation of RhoGTPases and cell spreading were inhibited; overexpression of 14-3-3 restored these functions. These studies: i) show that 14-3-3 is critical for \u03b1aIIb\u03b23-induced spreading; ii) describe a novel function of GPIb in dampening the transition to firm adhesion through the regulated sequestration of 14-3-3; and iii) suggest that the availability of 14-3-3 for \u03b1aIIb\u03b23-mediated adhesion is determined by the Gai-modulated level of GPIb phosphorylation.
