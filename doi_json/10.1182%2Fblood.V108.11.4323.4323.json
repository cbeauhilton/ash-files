    "abstract_text": "Heat shock protein 32 (Hsp32), also known as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), is a stress-related survival factor that has recently been implicated in enhanced survival of neoplastic cells. We here show that Hsp32/HO-1 is expressed abundantly in primary neoplastic cells in various solid tumors and hematopoietic neoplasms such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and in respective cell lines including the AML cell lines HL60, KG1, KG1a, and U937, CML cell lines K562 and KU812, eosinophilic leukemia cell line EOL-1, mast cell leukemia cell line HMC-1, myeloma cell lines RPMI8226 and U266, breast cancer cell line MDA MB 231, lung cancer cell line A549, pancreatic carcinoma cell line BxPC-3, colon carcinoma cell lines COLO201, COLO205, COLO320DM, and DLD-1, and the ovarian carcinoma cell line OVCAR-3. Expression of Hsp32 mRNA was demonstrable by RT-PCR and Northern blotting, and expression of the Hsp32 protein by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. The CML-specific oncoprotein BCR/ABL and the transforming oncoprotein KIT D816V that is expressed in neoplastic mast cells, were found to promote expression of Hsp32 in Ba/F3 cells. In order to examine the functional role of Hsp32 in neoplastic cells, a specific siRNA was employed. Expression of Hsp32 siRNA resulted in reduced viability and induction of apoptosis in all cell lines tested. To further explore the value of Hsp32 as a target in neoplastic cells, a novel specific Hsp32-targeting compound, styrene maleic acid copolymer zinc protoporphyrin micelles (SMA-ZnPP) was applied. Exposure to SMA-ZnPP resulted in a significant decrease in proliferation determined by 3 H-thymidine uptake, in all cell lines as well as in all primary neoplastic cells tested (AML, n=5; CML, n=5; mastocytosis, n=3; breast cancer, n=2; lung cancer, n=1). As assessed by AnnexinV-staining, Tunel assay and electron microscopy, the growth-inhibitory effects of SMA-ZnPP were found to be associated with induction of apoptosis. In each cell type, the effect of SMA-ZnPP on growth was dose-dependent and found to occur at pharmacologic concentrations (IC 50 1\u201330 \u03bcM). Moreover, SMA-ZnPP was found to synergize with various anti-neoplastic drugs (tumor cell lines: cisplatin, leukemias: cytarabine, myeloma: bortezomib) in producing growth inhibition. In summary, these data show that Hsp32/HO-1 is an important survival factor and novel interesting target in various hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic neoplasms. Based on these data, it seems desirable to explore the value of the Hsp32-targeting drug SMA-ZnPP in clinical trials in patients with leukemias and solid tumors."
