    "abstract_text": "Introduction: in recent years the feasibility of the discontinuation of tyrosine kinase treatment in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has been proven, and several clinical factors influencing the duration of treatment-free remission (TFR) after discontinuation have been studied. Aim: we analyzed the influence of bone marrow (BM) lymphocyte subsets on the molecular recurrence after discontinuation of Imatinib (IM) in CML. Methods: in a recent discontinuation study performed at our Institution (EDI-PIO trial) we assessed BM lymphocyte subsets before and after introduction of pioglitazone which was given 3 months before discontinuation of IM. Criterias for discontinuation were: patient in chronic phase at diagnosis, a minimum of 3 years on TKI and sustained molecular remission MR4.5 for at least 2 years. Lymphocyte populations studied: B, TCD8, TCD4, T CD4+CD8+ and T CD4- CD8- besides T na\u00efve and memory, TCR\u03b1\u03b2, TCR\u03b3\u03b4, NK-t and NK cells. The influence of Sokal score at diagnosis, the duration of imatinib treatment together with the BM lymphoid subsets on the time of treatment-free remission (TFR) were examined by uni- and multivariate Cox regressions. Results: we studied 30 out of 32 patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2013 that reached criteria for discontinuation that were included in EDI-PIO trial: 13 male and 17 female. Median age at diagnosis: 41 years (22-65). Median time of IM treatment: 116.3 months (38.2-209.3); 11 patients (36%) had a molecular recurrence in a median of 5,17 months (2.4-29.4). For patients remaining in TFR the median time of follow-up was 46 months (26.3-55.9). Median overall time of IM treatment (IM-Tr) was 65 months for patients recurring and 124 months for those remaining in TFR. In the univariate Cox regression a significant value was found for IM-Tr, higher percentages of T CD4+CD8+ and lower ones of TCR\u03b3\u03b4 lymphocytes at discontinuation. In the multivariate model only the T CD4+CD8+ remained. Conclusion: discontinuation of IM is feasible in patients remaining in continuous MR4.5 for more than 2 years. A longer time of IM treatment and higher values of BM T CD4+CD8+ predict a lower risk of relapse.
