    "abstract_text": "Background: Vasoregulation is impaired in human and murine sickle cell disease (SCD). Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress impair vasodilation. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) plays an important role in attenuating inflammatory responses. Previously we showed 4F, an apoA-I mimetic designed to improve HDL function, dramatically restores vasodilation in SCD mice. Here, we examine mechanisms by which D-4F restores vasodilation in SCD mice and in mice made to develop SCD via fetal liver hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Effects of proinflammatory lipids and D-4F were determined in HSCT-SCD- LDL receptor null (Ldlr\u2212/\u2212) mice fed either chow or western diet (WD). The role of HDL was examined in HSCT-SCD-apoA-I null (apoA-I\u2212/\u2212) mice. Finally, the role of eNOS was examined in HSCT-SCD-eNOS deficient (eNOS\u2212/\u2212) mice. Mice were treated with or without D-4F (1mg/kg/d for 6\u20138 wks). Results: Total cholesterol concentrations in HSCT-SCD-Ldlr\u2212/\u2212 mice fed lab chow were slightly increased compared to transgenic SCD mice (40\u201360 vs. 90\u2013130 mg/dL, p<0.05) with no change in HDL. Acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation (Ach, 10-7 to 10-4M) in HSCT-SCD-Ldlr\u2212/\u2212 mice was impaired compared to untreated non-SCD Ldlr\u2212/\u2212 mice (10 vs 43%, p<0.05). D-4F restored eNOS-dependent vasodilation in HSCT-SCD-Ldlr\u2212/\u2212 mice to the level in non-SCD Ldlr\u2212/\u2212 mice. D-4F did not alter total cholesterol or HDL in HSCT-SCD-Ldlr\u2212/\u2212 mice but did decrease proinflammatory HDL (580 vs 380, p<0.05), an index of oxidizability. In contrast to HSCT-SCD-Ldlr\u2212/\u2212 mice fed chow diet, HSCT-SCD-Ldlr\u2212/\u2212 mice fed WD had little to no ACh vasodilation (0\u20133%). D-4F increased vasodilation slightly in HSCT-SCD-Ldlr\u2212/\u2212 fed WD (~12%). Total cholesterol and HDL increased in response to WD in HSCT-SCD-Ldlr\u2212/\u2212 mice (p<0.01). D-4F induced minimal changes in total cholesterol, HDL or proinflammatory HDL in these mice. To examine the role of HDL, we found that vasodilation in HSCT-SCD-apoA-I\u2212/\u2212 mice was reduced to ~25% compared to 65% in C57BL/6 mice (p<0.01). D-4F nearly doubled vasodilation to ~43% in HSCT-SCD-apoA-I\u2212/\u2212 mice (p<0.05). L-NAME (100\u03bcM) blocked vasodilation in all HSCT-SCD-apoA-I\u2212/\u2212 mice, indicating vasodilation was mediated exclusively by eNOS. In contrast, when we examined the effect of eNOS deficiency, ACh induced minimal increases in vasodilation (~22%). Dissection of cellular mechanisms mediating vasodilation revealed that a small portion HSCT-SCD-eNOS\u2212/\u2212 mice was inhibited by L-NAME (i.e., NOS, ~12%), with none mediated by COX-prostacyclin (0%) and a small portion mediated by cytochrome P450 (~10%). Inhibitor studies revealed D-4F restored vasodilation in HSCT-SCD-eNOS\u2212/\u2212 mice to ~52% (p<0.05) by predominately a L-NAME-inhibitable mechanism (NOS = 40%; COX-prostacylcin = 0% and cytochrome P450 = 11%). Conclusions: D-4F improves eNOS-dependent vasodilation even when hypercholesterolemia is superimposed on SCD. Measurements of proinflammatory HDL reveal D-4F restores vasodilation by protecting HDL against oxidation. Interestingly, D-4F protects vasodilation even in mice that have low levels of apoA-I-deficient HDL. Taken together, these data indicate proinflammatory HDL plays a critical role in mechanisms by which SCD impairs eNOS-dependent vasodilation and D-4F increases vasodilation, at least in part, by decreasing proinflammatory HDL in SCD."
