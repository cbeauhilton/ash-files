    "abstract_text": "Introduction and Methods: RIC HSCT has become a therapeutic option for elderly patients (pts) with AML and MDS in 1 st CR (CR1). However the overall applicability of this procedure in such pts has not been assessed. To do so we wrote a protocol stipulating that all pts age > 50 with AML would be seen by a transplant service consult at first MDACC presentation. A donor search would be initiated and all pts with a matched sibling, or unrelated donor would receive RIC HSCT in 1 st CR using a Fludarabine/Melphalan conditioning regimen. Results: 99 of 257 pts undergoing induction therapy from 2001\u20132003 achieved a CR (39%). BMT consulted on 62 of the 99 (63%), and 25 of the 62 (40%) had a potential donor (20 sibling, 5 unrelated). 14 pts received a HSCT in CR1 (14% of CR1 pts, 5 % of all pts; 13 sibling, 1 unrelated). Survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were each worse in non-consulted pts (group A) than in consulted pts ( p =0.009 for S, medians of 28 and 66 weeks; p =0.019 for RFS, with medians of 20 vs. 36 weeks). This may have reflected the worse performance status of Group A pts (ECOG-PS 3,4 in 19% vs. 5%). Consulted pts without a donor (group B) did worse than consulted pts with donor (groups C+D [OS 49 vs. 124 wks ( p =0.03); RFS 23 vs. 52 wks ( p =0.016)]. Transplanted pts in CR1 (group C) did better than the remainder of consulted pts (groups B+D) and OS ( p =0.023) and RFS ( p <0.001) were not reached at 86 wks median f/u. Median time to HSCT was 17 weeks and transplant-related mortality zero. Among pts with donors in CR1 transplanted pts did better [RFS: p =0.001; OS: p =0.156]. The primary reason for not receiving a HSCT in CR1 pts with potential donor (Group D) was disease relapse in 81%. Significant group differences included: younger age of consulted pts ( p =0.01); younger age of consulted pts with donor ( p =0.03); younger age of transplanted pts ( p =.01), less frequent \u22125/\u22127 ( p =0.02) but more frequent 11Q abnormalities ( p =0.007) in the donor and transplant group.

The improved RFS in the transplant group persisted but was no longer statistically significant ( p =0.197). Conclusion: RIC HSCT in selected elderly CR1 pts improved OS and RFS, likely due to the graft-versus-leukemia effect. However, transplant efficacy could also be due to younger age, better cytogenetics, less comorbidity, lead-time bias or unknown selection factors. The performance of RIC HSCT in only 14% of elderly pts in CR1 and only 5% of elderly pts raises questions about the general applicability of this procedure, since most pts die before receiving a HSCT or do not enter CR1.",
