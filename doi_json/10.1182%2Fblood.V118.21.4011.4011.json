    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4011 Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells with anti-inflammatory activity. MyD88 is a cytoplasmic adaptor molecule essential for integrating and transducing the signals generated by the toll-like receptor (TLR) family. Activation of inflammatory signaling through MyD88, presumably through ligation of multiple TLRs, plays a key role in the expansion of MDSCs. We therefore investigated how the MyD88-dependent expansion of MDSCs from donor bone marrow (BM) contributes to protection of acute GVHD. To test this, we employed an intestinal GVHD murine model, C57BL/6 (H-2 b ) \u2192 B6D2F1 (H-2 b/d ), which differs at major and minor histocompatibility loci. Lethally irradiated recipient mice were transplanted with wild-type (WT) or MyD88 knock out (KO) mice T cell-depleted (TCD)-BM together with WT spleen T cells. Morbidity and mortality of GVHD was significantly worse in recipients of MyD88 KO TCD-BM with higher intestinal pathologic grading. Animals that underwent syngeneic HSCT did not show early mortality regardless of presence of MyD88 in BM, which ruled out myelosuppression-associated toxicity. The expression of Gr-1 + CD11b + in blood, mesenteric lymph nodes and liver on day 13 was significantly reduced in the recipients of MyD88 KO TCD-BM compared with those of WT TCD-BM while the percentage of donor T cells infiltrating colon and liver was significantly higher. In parallel, the percentages of donor T cells to undergo apoptosis in response to alloantigens in vivo were significantly decreased in recipients of MyD88 KO TCD-BM. Injection of MDSCs from BM of non-tumor bearing donor markedly inhibited GVHD lethality in recipients of MyD88 KO TCD-BM. Moreover, i n vivo administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR ligand, to donor mice expanded GR-1 + CD11b + in BM with enhanced expression of MyD88 mRNA. Recipients of TCD-BM from WT mice injected LPS showed attenuated GVHD severity as measured by weight loss and survival compared to those of TCD-BM from WT mice injected diluent. In summary, MyD88-dependent expansion of GR-1 + CD11b + population from donor TCD-BM appears to be critical for survival after allo-HSCT. Incomplete expansion of GR-1 + CD11b + population in target organs correlates with decreased apoptosis and increased infiltration of donor T cells into the target organs.
