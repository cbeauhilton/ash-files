    "abstract_text": "Control of intensity and duration of erythropoietin (Epo) signalling is necessary to tightly regulate red blood cells production. After Epo stimulation of erythroid cells, 2 types of signal are transduced via the Epo receptor (Epo-R): positive signals involved in survival and proliferation, and negative signals involved in signal arrest. We have recently shown that the ubiquitin/ proteasome system plays a major role in the control of Epo-R signalling duration and desensitisation processes. Indeed, after Epo stimulation the Epo-R is ubiquitinated and its intracellular part is degraded by the proteasome, preventing further signal transduction. The remaining part of the receptor, together with associated Epo is internalised and degraded by the lysosomes (Walrafen et al 2005 Blood, 105, 600-608). Our aim was to identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in Epo-R ubiquitination. The Epo-R contains a putative \u03b2-Trcp binding site in its intracellular domain. Interestingly, this putative binding sequence is located in a region of the Epo-R that is deleted in erythroid progenitors from patients with familial polycythemia. We show that \u03b2-Trcp is responsible for Epo-R ubiquitination upon Epo stimulation. After Epo stimulation, \u03b2-Trcp binds to the Epo-R and this binding is dependent on Jak2 activation. Mutation of the Ser 462 residue of the Epo-R, located in the consensus \u03b2-Trcp binding site abolished \u03b2-Trcp binding, Epo-R ubiquitination and EpoR cleavage by the proteasome. Activation of the mutated Epo-R is prolonged in comparaison with Epo-R WT and BaF3 cells expressing this mutated receptor unable to bind \u03b2-Trcp are hypersensitive to Epo. Whether the removal of the \u03b2-Trcp binding site contributes to the hypersensitivity to Epo in familial polycythemia is currently under study.]"
