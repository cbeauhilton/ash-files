    "abstract_text": "Introduction: ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) improved outcomes for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive leukemia, however, some patients are still resistance to ABL TKIs. One of the most common mechanisms involves point mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1, however, mechanisms of intrinsic resistance without point mutation of ABL kinase domain are not fully understood. Moreover, ABL TKIs cannot cure the Ph-positive leukemia patients because of leukemia stem cells in the bone marrow niche. Therefore, new approach against leukemia stem cells may improve the outcome of Ph-positive leukemia patients. Hypoxia is an important component of the bone marrow microenvironment. Because oxygen tension plays a key role in driving normal hematopoiesis, leukemia stem cells may be maintained in hypoxic areas of the bone marrow. Materials and methods: In this study, we established ABL TKI-resistant in vitro cell line models (K562 imatinib-R, K562 nilotinib-R, K562 dasatinib-R, K562 ponatinib-R and Ba/F3 T315I). We investigated gene expression profiles in cultured ABL TKI resistant cells and parental cell line, K562 in normoxia and hypoxia condition by DNA microarray. Results: We first investigated gene expression profiles in cultured K562 cells in hypoxia condition. We found gene expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) was increased K562 cells in hypoxia condition by DNA microarray. We next examined ABL TKI resistant cell lines (K562 imatinib-R, K562 nilotinib-R, K562 dasatinib-R, K562 ponatinib-R) in this study. We could not detect the BCR-ABL point mutation in ABL TKI resistant cells. We found gene expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) receptor (IGF1R) was increased ABL TKI resistant K562 cells. IGF1R gene amplification was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. IGF is tightly regulated by six related IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). One of IGFBP, IGFBP5 is related to imatinib sensitivity and resistant in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients (GSE12211). In hypoxia condition, several IGFBPs were also increased in ABL TKI resistant cells. IGF cause intracellular signaling that ultimately results in cellular growth and proliferation. Thus, we initially examined whether addition of IGF1R inhibition could enhance ABL TKIs sensitivity. One of IGF1R inhibitor, linsitinib was inhibited ABL TKI resistant cells and parental cell line, K562 in hypoxia condition. ABL TKI resistant cell lines were more sensitive against linsitinib. Combined treatment of ABL TKI resistant cells and K562 cells with ABL TKIs and linsitinib caused more cytotoxicity than each drug alone in hypoxia condition. Caspase 3/7 activity and cellular cytotoxicity was also increased after ABL TKIs and linsitnib treatment. In the colony formation method, the number of cell colonies were also reduced in hypoxia condition. Intracellular ATP levels have been implicated in vitro as a determinant of cell death by apoptosis. The concentrations of intracellular ATP were reduced after ABL TKIs and linsitinib. We next blocked IGF1R function by small interfering RNA (siRNA). SiRNA transfected cells were reduced cellular proliferation. We also found drug sensitivity of the cells to the imatinib was increased compared to mock-transfected cells. Apoptotic cells and caspase 3/7 activity were increased after imatinib treatment in siRNA transfected cells. Conclusion: The IGF1 pathway is involved in Ph-positive leukemia cells in hypoxia condition and ABL TKI resistant in CML cells. We also provide the promising clinical relevance as a candidate drug for treatment of residual leukemia cells in bone marrow niche which is in hypoxia condition.
