    "abstract_text": "Thrombopoietin (TPO), the primary regulator of megakaryocyte (MK) and platelet formation, modulates the activity of multiple signal transduction molecules, including those in the Jak/STAT, p42/p44 MAPK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways. In the previous study, we reported that PI3K and Akt are necessary for TPO-induced cell cycle progression of primary MK progenitors. The absence of PI3K activity results in a block of transition from G 1 to S phase in these cells ( Geddis AE et al. JBC  2001  276 : 34473 \u201334479 ). However, the molecular events secondary to the activation of PI3K/Akt responsible for MK proliferation remain unclear. In this study we show that FOXO3a and its downstream target p27 Kip1 play an important role in TPO-induced proliferation of MK progenitors. TPO induces phosphorylation of Akt and FOXO3a in both UT-7/TPO, a megakaryocytic cell line, and primary murine MKs in a PI3K dependent fashion. Cell cycle progression of UT-7/TPO cells is blocked in G 1 phase by inhibition of PI3K. We found that TPO down-modulates p27 Kip1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in UT-7/TPO cells and primary MKs in a PI3K dependent fashion. UT-7/TPO stably expressing constitutively active Akt or a dominant-negative form of FOXO3a failed to induce p27 Kip1 expression after TPO withdrawal. Induced expression of an active form of FOXO3a resulted in increased p27 Kip1 expression in this cell line. In an attempt to assess whether FOXO3a has an effect of MK proliferation in vivo, we compared the number of MKs in Foxo3a -deficient mice and in wild type controls. Although peripheral blood cell counts of erythrocytes, neutrophils, monocytes and platelets were normal in the Foxo3a -deficient mice, total nucleated marrow cell count of Foxo3a -deficient mice were 60% increased compared with wild type controls. In addition, the increase of MKs was more profound than that of total nucleated marrow cells; CD41 + MKs from Foxo3a -deficient mice increased 2.1-fold, and mature MKs with 8N and greater ploidy increased 2.5-fold, compared with wild type controls. Taken together with the previous observation that p27 Kip1 -deficient mice also display increased numbers of MK progenitors, our findings strongly suggest that the effect of TPO on MK proliferation is mediated by PI3K/Akt-induced FOXO3a inactivation and subsequent p27 Kip1 down-regulation in vitro and in vivo."
