    "abstract_text": "It has been well-documented in cardiac patients and in the general population that physical activity improves physical and mental health. Physical activity could also improve the health and quality of life of long-term lymphoma survivors, but little is known about physical activity in this group of patients. Using the Mayo Tumor Registry, we identified eligible patients who were 16 years or older at diagnosis, U.S. residents, first diagnosed with Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma from 1984\u20131998, diagnosed and/or initially treated at Mayo Clinic Rochester, and survived for 5 to 20 years (N=2,485). In October of 2004, we mailed a 23-page survey to 95 randomly selected patients; 7 were found to be ineligible (deceased or too ill). Of the 88 remaining patients, we were able to find a correct address for 82, and 57 completed a survey for a 70% participation rate. Physical activity was self-reported using the Godin (1985) Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. Of the 54 patients with complete data for this report, the mean age at completion of the questionnaire was 60.8 years (26.1\u201386.7). The mean time since diagnosis was 12.0 years (6.3\u201319.9), and 52% survived more than 11 years. The histologies included 22 (39%) Hodgkin lymphoma, 21 (38%) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 3 (5%) follicular lymphomas, 1 (2%) high-grade lymphoma, 5 (9%) peripheral T-cell lymphomas, and 4 (7%) other. Regular fitness was reported by 21% of the respondents. This is lower than a recent report of adults aged 50 years and older, where approximately 40% of those free of chronic disability were attaining recommended daily physical activity levels. It is also lower than the expected 30% in patients with disabilities from the Behavioral Risk Factor Survey ( Brown DR et al., Med Sci Sports Exerc  2005 ; 37 : 620 \u20139 ). In addition, although not statistically significant, there were effect sizes observed suggesting that sedentary responders had higher levels of depression, higher anxiety levels, more distress, and lower quality of life (QOL) compared to physically active respondents. These finding need to be verified in a larger sample to obtain better estimates. In conclusion, levels of physical activity were lower than general population samples. These results also suggest that physical activity level may be related to improved mood and QOL in this population.",
