    "abstract_text": "Introduction Silk fibroin, derived from Bombyx mori silkworm cocoons, is used extensively in biomaterials and regenerative medicine. The useful characteristics of this protein include self-assembly, robust mechanical properties, biocompatibility and biodegradability. Moreover, silk can be enhanced through a variety of chemical modifications that affect cell attachment, growth and differentiation. Thrombocytopenia occurs when a patient suffers from an abnormally low platelet count in the peripheral blood; usually a result of disease, trauma, or cancer treatment. To treat these patients, it is estimated that two million platelet transfusions are performed in the U.S. each year. This high demand for platelets has created a clinical demand for studying the causes of thrombocytopenia and alternative routes for treatment. Platelets are anuclear cells that are released into the bloodstream in the bone marrow by megakaryocytes via the extension of long filaments called proplatelets. It is hypothesized that platelet production from megakaryocytes is regulated by environmental factors at the site of bone marrow vascular niche. Studies of megakaryopoiesis are typically performed on extracellular matrix protein-coated culture plates and transwell membranes. While these initial studies have provided invaluable insight into the process of megakaryopoiesis, the goal of the present project was to create a bone marrow model that mimics the vascular niche for functional in vitro platelet production. We hypothesized that a silk-based in vitro tissue model would allow the effects of substrate surface properties and endothelial co-culture on megakaryopoiesis to be studied in a holistic manner, thereby enabling further elucidation of the mechanisms involved in the process of platelet production. Results In order to more closely mimic the bone marrow vascular niche structure, a porous silk sponge was assembled around the silk vessel-like tubes. Megakarycytes seeded in the porous silk sponge migrated toward the silk tube and released platelets into the tube lumen. The perfusion bioreactor moved the platelets into the platelet collecting bags. After perfusion the platelets were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry. The bioreactor platelets exhibited similar morphology, CD41 positive staining, and activation compared to peripheral blood platelet controls. Megakaryocyte attachment and proplatelet formation through the silk vascular wall were improved by altering the silk properties. Silk functionalized by entrapping extracellular matrix proteins within the tube membrane resulted in increased megakaryocyte attachment and proplatelet compared to unfunctionalized silk tube controls. Silk surface roughness improved megakaryocyte attachment compared to the control but did not affect proplatelets. Decreasing the silk stiffness improved proplatelets, but did not significantly affect megakaryocyte attachment. Co-culture with endothelial cells improved megakaryocyte attachment while maintaining a high level of proplatelet formation. Additionally, megakaryocyte and endothelial cell co-culture on the silk vessel model resulted in an icreased platelet production compared to megakaryocytes cultured alone. Conclusions The goal of this project was to develop an in vitro model of megakaryopoiesis using a tissue engineering approach. Using human megakaryocytes and endothelial cells, we demonstrate the following advanced features of the silk-based model: (1) immobilization of extracellular matrix components within the membrane, (2) tunable surface topography, (3) tunable mechanical properties, (4) physiologically relevant thickness for appropriate proplatelet extension, and (5) controlled localization of a vascular endothelium. Thus, by functionalizing silk, we can control megakaryocyte function on silk. The broader impact of this work offers a versatile new tool for studying megakaryocyte development and platelet production in vitro. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
