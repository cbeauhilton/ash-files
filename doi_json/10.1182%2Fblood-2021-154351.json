    "abstract_text": "Background : Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family proteins represent a novel target class for patients (pts) with myeloid malignancies. Pharmacologic inhibition of BET proteins transcriptionally downregulates critical pro-survival and anti-apoptotic genes. We hypothesized that combination of BET inhibitor (BETi) with hypomethylating agent (HMA) azacitidine (AZA) could lead to clinical benefit for high-risk (HR) pts with R/R MDS and AML. Methods : We conducted an investigator-initiated, single-center, phase I, 3+3 dose-escalation and cohort expansion study of PLX51107 (BETi) + AZA in pts with R/R HR MDS (intermediate-2 score or >10% blasts) or R/R AML. PLX51107 was administered PO on days 1-21 and AZA 75 mg/m2 IV on days 8-14 of a 28-day cycle. Dose-escalation phase of PLX51107 doses included: 40mg (n=4), 80mg (n=3), and 120mg; ultimately, no formal MTD was reached, therefore the 120mg dose was administered to the remaining 30 pts treated on study. Results : 37 pts were treated [R/R AML (n=33); R/R HR MDS (n= 4)]. Baseline characteristics included in Table. Median age was 64 years [18-85 years]. 51% female. Baseline cytogenetics: Notably, 18 pts (49%) had chromosome (chr) 3 abnormalities (abnl) [(either alone or with complex cytogenetics) with 15/18, or 89%, + for EVI1/MECOM gene rearrangement by FISH. 81-gene panel Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) showed: NRAS (n=11); TP53 (n=9); ASXL1 , PTPN11 , RUNX1 , SF3B1 , & WT1 (n=6 each). Median prior # therapies = 3 [1-9]; 97% had prior HMA therapy; 84% had prior venetoclax (VEN).17 (46%) pts had prior stem cell transplant (SCT); 7 of whom were on concurrent active immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD prophylaxis at time of enrollment and continued on study (n=6 tacrolimus; n=1 sirolimus). 9 had prior myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) or MDS preceding AML. 16 (43%) had prior malignancy (including lymphoma n=3). Toxicities: Median # cycles on therapy = 2 [1-19+]. Most common grade 1/2 non-hematologic toxicities: fatigue 3%; cholecystitis 3% and vomiting 3%. Notable grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicities: 9 (24%) pts had elevated bilirubin/liver function tests (n=2 Grade 4 and n=7 Grade 3) and n=24 had infections. Hematologic toxicities were n=7 (4 Grade 3, 3 Grade 4) anemia; n=6 (all Grade 4) thrombocytopenia, n=3 (2 Grade 3, 1 Grade 4) neutropenia. Outcomes : Overall Response Rate (ORR) = 8/37 (22%): complete remission with incomplete platelet counts (CRp) (n=1); morphological leukemia-free state (MLFS) (n=2) (both MLFS responders had chr 3 abnl); hematologic improvement (HI) (n=5). Additionally, 5 other pts had >50% bone marrow blast reduction. 4 pts were able to stay on study \u22656 months, with one patient staying on active therapy with ongoing clinical benefit for \u22651 year (16.7 months+). Notably, 10/13 (77%) of all of these responding pts occurred in prior VEN-treated pts. 6/13 (46%) of all responses occurred in RUNX1 or NRAS/KRAS family-mutated pts. Median time on study was 4.8 months [0.4-16.7]. Median overall survival was 3.6 [0.4 - 16.7] months (Figure). One remarkable responder, a 70 year-old woman with R/R AML and extensive leukemia cutis, (prior VEN-based therapy), achieved CRp and almost complete resolution of all skin lesions with no major toxicities after 3 cycles of therapy. Laboratory correlative analysis : RNA-Seq analysis of mononuclear cells harvested on- treatment (day 3) vs pre-treatment demonstrated markedly greater fold changes in mRNA expressions in the complete responders, with downregulation of MYC , BCL2 , IL7R and CDK6 genes and upregulation of HEXIM , CD93 , DCXR and CDKN1A genes. Immunoblot analyses confirmed reduction in the protein levels of c-Myc, CDK6, BCL2 and BCL-xL and induction of BRD4 and HEXIM1 protein levels in the responding pts. Conclusions : In a heavily pre-treated, high-risk group of pts with R/R HR MDS and AML, with 49% chr 3 abnl, 46% prior SCT, and 25% TP53-mutated, we demonstrate that the combination of BETi and HMA is safe, well-tolerated, and results in modest clinical benefit predominantly in prior VEN-treated pts. Future directions may include investigation of novel BETi combinations in VEN-nai\u0308ve pts, further investigation into high-risk subsets of pts with chr 3 abnl/ EVI1/MECOM rearrangements, RUNX1 , and RAS -family mutated pts, and further clinical/translational investigation of BETi activity in leukemia cutis/skin lesions in myeloid malignancies.
