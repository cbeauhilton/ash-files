    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2661 Background: Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) identifies mature T-cell neoplasms based on detection of populations with aberrant expression of T-cell antigens or on the recognition of largely expanded T-cell populations with a regular T-cell immunophenotype. In cases with equivocal findings the differentiation between clonal T-cell populations and reactive conditions is not possible and molecular genetic assessment of T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements is needed to prove clonality. The flow cytometric analysis of the TCR V\u03b2 repertoire of T-cell populations has been suggested to improve diagnostics in this regard. Aims: To assess the diagnostic capabilities of the flow cytometric analysis of the TCR V\u03b2 repertoire of T-cell populations in identifying clonal T-cell populations. Methods: We studied 83 patients with a differential diagnosis of mature T-cell neoplasms (29 female, 54 male; median age 65.8 yrs, range 18.4\u201386.3; peripheral blood n=52, bone marrow n=31). The repertoire of the V\u03b2 chain was analyzed by applying the IOTest\u00ae Beta Mark Kit (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL). This kit contains monoclonal antibodies against 24 different members of variable regions of the TCR\u03b2 chain covering about 70% of all members. V\u03b2 analysis was performed 1) for the complete T-cell population of the respective samples identified by CD45-side scatter gating and detection of the expression of pan-T-cell antigens and 2) for T-cell subpopulation identified by an aberrant pattern of T-cell antigen expression. Results were validated using molecular genetic findings on TCR rearrangements as standard: 49 patients had genetically proven TCR rearrangements and 16 patients had not while in 18 patients only a small T-cell clone within a polyclonal background was detected. Results: The median percentage of expression of the different V\u03b2 members per patient was 1.1% (range, 0% to 99.3%). While the respective median expression values were similar for the different V\u03b2 members ranging from 0.4% to 4.1% the maximum values for the different V\u03b2 members varied considerably between 1.9% and 99.3%. Thus, this data suggests that V\u03b2 members with low expression only, e.g. V\u03b211 (range 0% to 1.9%) and V\u03b24 (range 0% to 4.8%), were not expressed in any clonal T-cell population in the present cohort while other V\u03b2 members with high expression in some patients clearly were, e.g. V\u03b217, V\u03b29 and V\u03b28 with maximum percentages of 99.3%, 98.3% and 97.8%, respectively. 65 patients with clear-cut genetic results (49 clonal, 16 non-clonal) were subject of validating the use of MFC to identify T-cell clonality. The first step was performed applying a cut-off of 16% for any V\u03b2 member which was found to be the optimum cut-off level. A V\u03b2 member expression >16% was found in 33 cases all of which with were proven clonal by genetics. However, 16 out of the remaining 32 patients with no V\u03b2 member expressed at >16% were also proven clonal by genetics and thus were missed by this first MFC step. Since only about 70% of V\u03b2 members are detected by the applied kit a large clonal T-cell population expressing an undetected V\u03b2 member would result in reduced percentages for the detected V\u03b2 members. Therefore, the second MFC step to identify the presence of clonal T-cell populations was based on the sum of the percentages for all analyzed V\u03b2 members. In 14 of the remaining 32 patients this sum amounted to 58%: 16 were proven non-clonal by genetics and 2 were proven clonal by genetics. Thus, overall 47 cases were identified as clonal by MFC with 100% specificity while 2 genetically positive cases were not identified by MFC resulting in a sensitivity of 95.9%. Interestingly, within the 18 cases with only small T-cell clones within a polyclonal background by genetics 6 and 8 were identified positive by MFC using step 1 and 2, respectively, as defined above. The remaining 4 cases revealed subpopulations of T-cells with aberrant immunophenotypes featuring a high expression of single V\u03b2 members (range 26.0 to 88.9%). Conclusions: The flow cytometric assessment of the T-cell receptor V\u03b2 repertoire identifies clonal T-cell populations with high specificity and sensitivity. It can be performed very easily and quickly and may substitute molecular genetic testing in many cases.
