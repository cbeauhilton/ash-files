    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4509 Objective We have previously reported that lung-derived microvesicles (MVs) can enter target marrow cells, resulting in increased levels of lung-specific mRNAs (Stem Cells 25:2245, 2007). Marrow cells which have been exposed to MVs also show increased production of pulmonary epithelial cells after transplantation into irradiated mice. The present studies have addressed the universality of the mRNA modulation and the underlying mechanisms. Methods/Results Co-culture of heart, brain, liver, and lung tissue across from murine marrow, but separated by a 0.4 micron cell-impermeable membrane, show tissue specific elevations of mRNA. MVs were found to contain lung-specific mRNA and 200 microRNAs. Proteomic studies of MVs showed up to 75 individual proteins, some of which are known to be associated with MV biogenesis and trafficking. Studies using rat/mouse hybrid cultures demonstrated that the target cell induced lung-specific mRNA elevations were mediated by transcriptional mechanisms. In these experiments, rat lung was co-cultured across from murine marrow cells and RT-PCR was performed using rat or mouse-specific primers for surfactant B. High levels of rat-specific surfactant B were seen in the co-cultured marrow cells indicating that transcription had been induced in the target cells. These conclusions were supported by additional studies employing the transcription factor inhibitors actinomycin-D and alpha-amantin. RNase treatment of conditioned media prior to marrow cell co-culture suggested that transfer of RNA may be involved in these mRNA elevations. However, our transcriptional studies indicate that we are not observing a simple transfer of MV lung-specific mRNA. One possible mechanism may be transfer of microRNA with epigenetic changes resulting in lung-specific mRNA production. Conclusion In summary, these observations suggest the existence of unique pathways for information transfer and cell phenotype determination. MV transfer could represent an underlying mechanism for much of the previous reported stem cell plasticity in different tissues. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
