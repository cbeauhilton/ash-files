    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Tissue factor exposing microparticles (TF + MPs) are capable to activate hemostasis in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of TF + MPs during physiologic activation of hemostasis in vivo in human. Methods: In a double-blind, cross-over study healthy male volunteers (n=13) were randomized to 7 days treatment with 100 mg aspirin and placebo, respectively. At the end of each treatment period TF + MPs were determined in venous blood and in blood emerging from a skin incision reflecting hemostasis in an activated state (shed blood). TF + MPs were analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with annexin V, a TF-antibody and cell-specific antibodies. Results: Compared to venous blood, the median (interquartile range) number of TF + MPs was significantly higher in shed blood: 16.2 (11.3 \u2013 20.1) k/ml vs. 8.2 (5.9 \u2013 14.8) k/ml ( p = 0.004). TF + MPs from platelets were higher in shed blood than in venous blood [4.7 (3.7 \u2013 8.6) k/ml vs. 3.3 (2.0 \u2013 5.0) k/ml, p = 0.03], whereas TF + MPs from endothelial cells were not [1.7 (1.2 \u2013 5.8) k/ml vs. 2.7 (1.7 \u2013 4.5) k/ml, p = 0.9]. Aspirin did not significantly influence the level of TF-MPs both in venous blood and in shed blood. Conclusion: High levels of TF + MPs can be detected at the site of physiologic activation of hemostasis in vivo in human.",
