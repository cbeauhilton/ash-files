    "abstract_text": "Background: The use of haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using post- transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy), calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and mycophenolate as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis is rapidly increasing in patients (pts) lacking suitable HLA-matched donors. Herein we compare outcomes of haploidentical HCT using this GVHD prophylaxis with 8/8 allele-level MUD HCT. Methods: Included are 917 adult (>18) lymphoma pts who underwent allogeneic HCT between 2008 and 2013. All pts received non-myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning regimens. The study cohort was divided into 3 groups; haploidentical (n=185), MUD without (w/o) antithymocyte globulin (ATG; n=491) and MUD with (w/) ATG (n=291). The primary end-point was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included cumulative incidence (Cum-Inc) of acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse/progression (rel/prog) and progression-free survival (PFS). The study had an 83% power to detect an 11% difference in OS. Results: The baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Pts in the haploidentical group received conditioning with Flu/CY/2Gy TBI and PT-Cy + CNI and mycophenolate as GVHD prophylaxis, while the two MUD cohorts received fludarabine-based (+ an alkylator or 2GyTBI) conditioning and CNI-based GVHD prophylaxis. Graft source was bone marrow in 93% of the haploidentical pts and peripheral blood in 94% and 91% of MUD w/o ATG and MUD w/ ATG pts, respectively. The 28-day neutrophil recovery and platelet recovery were 94%, 97%, 97% (p=0.32) and 63%, 89%, 84% (p0.05), but compared to MUD w/ ATG, the MUD w/o ATG pts had a reduced mortality risk (RR=0.67; p=0.001). We tested for a transplant center effect on survival and found none. Conclusion: With lower-intensity conditioning regimens the early (up to 3 years) survival outcomes are comparable between conventional MUD transplants (w/ or w/o ATG) and haploidentical HCT with PT-Cy approach. Chronic GVHD was significantly lower with haploidentical HCT. Prospective, randomized confirmation of these findings is necessary before wide spread adoption of haploidentical HCT over MUD transplants in lymphomas. Table 1. . Haploidentical N=185 (%) .
