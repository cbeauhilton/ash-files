    "abstract_text": "Background: Outcomes with salvage regimens in pts with MCL who progress after Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) therapy are poor, with a median overall survival (OS) of 5.8 months (Martin, et al. Blood . 2016) and few pts proceeding to allogeneic stem cell transplant. ZUMA-2 is a Phase 2, registrational, multicenter, global study evaluating KTE-X19, an autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy, in pts with R/R MCL who received 1-5 prior therapies, including a BTKi. Here, we present interim efficacy and safety results from ZUMA-2. Methods: Eligible adults (aged \u2265 18 years) with R/R MCL had an ECOG score of 0 - 1 and \u2264 5 prior therapies, including chemotherapy, an anti-CD20 antibody, and a BTKi. Pts underwent leukapheresis and conditioning chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m 2 /d and fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 /d for 3 days) followed by a single infusion of KTE-X19 at a target dose of 2 \u00d7 10 6 CAR T cells/kg. Pts could have received bridging therapy with dexamethasone, ibrutinib, or acalabrutinib after leukapheresis and before conditioning chemotherapy at the investigator's discretion. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR [complete response (CR) + partial response]) assessed by an Independent Review Committee according to the Lugano Classification (Cheson, et al. J Clin Oncol . 2014). Interim efficacy endpoints were investigator-assessed using the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson, et al. J Clin Oncol . 2007). Key secondary endpoints were duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), OS, frequency of adverse events (AEs), levels of CAR T cells in blood, and levels of cytokines in serum. Efficacy and safety analyses included all pts who received KTE-X19. A total of 60 pts received KTE-X19; here, we present results in pts who had \u2265 1 year of follow-up. Updated safety and efficacy results in the full 60 pts, including pts who received revised AE management with the aim of decreasing toxicity, will be reported in the presentation. Results: As of May 30, 2018, 28 pts received KTE-X19 with \u2265 1 year of follow-up (median 13.2 months [range, 11.5 - 18.5]). The median age was 65 years (range, 50 - 75) and 86% of pts were male. Forty-three percent of pts had ECOG score of 1, 21% had blastoid morphology, 82% had stage IV disease, 50% had intermediate/high-risk MIPI, 86% received a median of 4 (range, 1 - 5) prior therapies, and 57% were refractory to last prior therapy. In 20/28 pts with available data, the median Ki-67 index was 38% (range, 5% - 80%). Eight pts received bridging therapy; all had disease present post-bridging. Investigator-assessed ORR was 86% (95% CI, 67% - 96%) with a CR rate of 57% (95% CI, 37% - 76%). As of May 30, 2018, 75% of responders remained in response and 64% of treated pts had ongoing responses. The 12-month estimates of DOR, PFS and OS were 83% (95% CI, 60% - 93%), 71% (95% CI, 50% - 84%), and 86% (95% CI, 66% - 94%), respectively and the medians were not reached. The most common Grade \u2265 3 AEs (\u2265 20% of pts) were anemia (54%), platelet count decreased (39%), neutropenia (36%), neutrophil count decreased (32%), white blood cell count decreased (29%), encephalopathy (25%), and hypertension (21%). Grade 3/4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) assessed by Lee et al. ( Blood. 2014) was reported in 18% of pts, most commonly manifesting as hypotension (14%), hypoxia (14%), and pyrexia (11%). Grade 3/4 neurologic events (NE) were reported in 46% of pts and included encephalopathy (25%), confusional state (14%), and aphasia (11%). No Grade 5 CRS or NE occurred. All CRS events and most NE (15/17 pts) were reversible. Median time to onset and resolution of CRS was 2 days (range, 1 - 7) and 13 days (range, 4 - 60), respectively. Median time to onset of NE was 6 days (range, 1 - 15) and median time to resolution was 20 days (range, 9 - 99). There was 1 Grade 5 AE of organizing pneumonia that was considered related to conditioning chemotherapy. Median CAR T cell levels as measured by peak and area under the curve were 99 cells/\u00b5L (range, 0.4 - 2589) and 1542 cells/\u00b5L (range, 5.5 - 27239), respectively. Peak CAR T cell expansion was observed between Days 8 and 15 and declined over time. Conclusions: ZUMA-2 is the first multicenter Phase 2 study of CAR T cell therapy in pts with R/R MCL. With \u2265 1 year of follow-up, KTE-X19 demonstrated significant and durable clinical benefit, including a majority of pts achieving CR, and a manageable safety profile in pts with R/R MCL for whom there are no curative treatment options.
