    "abstract_text": "Regulation of human \u03b3-globin expression depends on localized combinatorial interactions of trans-factors with cis-elements in the proximal promoter however, the full complement of proteins involved in \u03b3-gene regulation remains obscure. We previously demonstrated the ability of Stat3 \u03b1 to bind a +9 site in the A \u03b3-globin 5\u2032untranslated region ( A \u03b35\u2032UTR) to activate transcription. To expand on this observation we identified an overlapping Stat3/GATA-1 site (GAGATTATCAA) at nucleotide +21\u03b3. Recently Stat3 and GATA-1 were shown to participate in protein-protein interactions to regulate cell differentiation. Therefore we hypothesized that GATA-1 and Stat3 may regulate \u03b3-gene transcription through a similar mechanism. Initial chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed to demonstrate in vivo GATA-1 and Stat3 binding to the \u03b3-promoter. ChIP assay for the A \u03b3-globin region between \u2212122 to +65 produced 9-fold and 4-fold chromatin enrichment in K562 cells with GATA-1 and Stat3\u03b1 antibodies respectively compared to no enrichment with IgG. Treatment with Interleukin-6 mediated a 12-fold increase in bound Stat3\u03b1 and a concomitant 2-fold decrease in GATA-1 interactions. TFIID binding increased from 25-fold to 40-fold supporting transcriptional activation. To provide in vitro evidence for competitive binding in the +21\u03b3site, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed with K562 nuclear extracts and 32 P- labeled \u03b341 (+1 to +41), +21\u03b3, and Stat3 and GATA-1 consensus probes. Four specific DNA-protein complexes were established with \u03b341. Stat3 and GATA-1 antibody studies with the four probes demonstrated that Stat3 dimers and GATA-1 dimers were bound in the Band 1 and Band 4 complexes respectively; in contrast Stat3/GATA-1 heterodimers were present in the Band 3 complex. Studies with the +21\u03b3 probe confirmed our findings with \u03b341. The data are consistent with our hypothesis that GATA-1 and Stat3 compete for binding to the +21\u03b3 cis-element. To further our understanding of the in vivo consequences of GATA-1/Stat3 interactions, preliminary transient transfections were performed in K562 cells. The wild type -210\u03b3Luc reporter containing the \u2212210 to +36 \u03b3-promoter (10\u03bcg) and this mutant \u2212201\u03b3(+21mStat3)Luc reporter were co-transfected individually with \u03b2-galactosidase. The luciferase activity of \u2212201\u03b3Luc increased 110-fold after enforced pZeoStat3\u03b1 (30\u03bcg) expression which dropped 75-fold when tested with the mutant Stat3 reporter. Residual activity was attributed to the intact +9\u03b3 Stat3 site. Enforced pGFP-GATA-1 expression activated the \u2212201\u03b3Luc reporter 35-fold which increased further to 70-fold for the mutant reporter. Additional cotransfection studies will be completed to determine whether competitive interactions of Stat3 and GATA-1 occur to regulate \u03b3-globin transcription in vivo. To confirm and verify these observations, vitro competitive binding utilizing purified Stat3 and GATA-1 proteins will be performed. 2-Dimensional EMSA coupled with mass spectroscopy will be used for comprehensive identification of the protein components of complexes bound to the A \u03b35\u2032UTR."
