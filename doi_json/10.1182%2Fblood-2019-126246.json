    "abstract_text": "Background and Aim : Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common subtype of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) wherein those with advanced stage have a poor prognosis. The objective of this study was to describe clinical characteristics and survival in MF patients who were refractory or had relapsed after a first systemic therapy. Methods : A retrospective chart review study was conducted at 27 sites in Europe. Patients enrolled had a diagnosis of MF and proved to be relapsed/refractory (R/R) prior to 1-Jan-2016 after a first systemic therapy. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated from the date of R/R event (defined as the index date) using Kaplan-Meier estimates. PFS was defined as death, progression, second relapse or refractory, or presence of subsequent treatment after index date. Results : This study included 104 advanced R/R MF patients with a median age of 54.5 years (range: 21-82). The median follow-up was 3.5 years (range: 0-20.7) after index date. In total 80% of patients experienced a second R/R, with a median time to second R/R of 15.8 months (range: 0.6-174.6). The median age at death was 65 years (range: 42-85). In total 39 deaths (37.5%) were observed. Among those patients who had a known cause of death (N=35), 18 died of CTCL progression, 11 of CTCL complication or drug toxicity and 7 of other causes. The estimated median OS was 11.5 years (95% CI: 6.5 - not reached). The median PFS was 1.3 years (95% CI: 1.0-2.1). Conclusions : The high rate of R/R and low PFS suggest that the clinical burden of R/R MF is significant in five European countries, and recently approved targeted therapies have the potential of improving outcomes.
