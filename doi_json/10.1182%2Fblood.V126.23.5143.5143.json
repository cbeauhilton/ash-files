    "abstract_text": "Avascular necrosis of the femoral head is not specific disease. It occurs as a complication or secondary to various causes. These conditions probably lead to impaired blood supply to the femoral head. The diagnosis of AVNFH is based on clinical findings and supported by specific radiological manifestations. AVNFH occurs as a complication traumatic and non-traumatic disorders. Most cases of AVNFH are non-traumatic and occur secondary to excessive corticosteroid use and alcohol abuse.Other causes include coagulopathies, hemoglobinopathies (sickle cell disease), chronic liver disease ,gout, idiopathic hyperlipidemia, metabolic bone disorders, pregnancy, radiation, chemotherapy, smoking, systemic lupus erythematosus and vasculitis syndromes. Intravascular coagulation appears to be the central event associated with nontraumatic AVNFH , Coagulation may occur secondary to extravascular compression (marrow fat enlargement), vessel wall injury (chemotherapy, radiation), or a thromboembolic event (fat emboli). Magnetic resonance imaging MRI considered the preferred method for diagnosis of occult AVN, since it is more sensitive than bone scan or plain films. Due to the high incidence of bilateral AVN, MRI may pick up AVN in opposite asymptomatic hip. MRI has 90-100% sensitivity for symptomatic disease AVNFH can be presenting Manifestation for patient with CML as illustrated in table 1 Table 1.

Two issues to be considered; either the condition is rare or there is under-reporting of this side effect. Observational studies with proper reporting are required to accurately measure the incidence of this complication which could significantly affect patients' safety and quality of life.
