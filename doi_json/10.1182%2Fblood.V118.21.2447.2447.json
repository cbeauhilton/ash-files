    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2447 We examined the oncogenic potential of CBL deletion mutant found in AML patients in cytokine receptor and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTKs) expressing cells. In addition, we analyzed the interaction sites of FLT3/CBL and the critical pathways activated by CBL deletion mutants. RTK, CBL and AKT constructs were expressed in Ba/F3 cells via a retroviral expression vector. Stable protein expression after transduction and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was confirmed by western blotting and cellsurface-marker expression of receptors by flow cytometry. Cell Proliferation and apoptosis assays were done in presence and absence of IL-3 or receptor-ligands. Coexpression of RTK III-WT (PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FLT3, KIT) and CBL deletion mutants cause IL-3 independent and ligand dependent growth of Ba/F3 cells. RTK III-WT/CBL\u0394exon8 cells show a more than 10 fold hyperproliferation in response to ligand stimulation. In contrast Non-class III receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR, EPOR, MPL, IGF1R) and CSF1R show just a very weak hyperproliferation if coexpressed with the CBL deletion mutant. Selective protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors abrogate this proliferation. In cells coexpressing RTK-III receptor and CBL\u0394exon8 the receptor internalization is delayed and cells were protected from apoptosis after cytokine withdrawal. Ba/F3 cells after ligand stimulation and AML cell lines coexpressing CBL deletion mutants and FLT3 show an enhanced AKT phosphorylation. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the AKT inhibitor MK2206 abolish the CBL mutant mediated hyperproliferation. Furthermore, a combined pharmacological inhibition of PI3K/AKT pathway and RTK shows an additive effect. The transforming potential of the CBL mutant is completely abolished by a mutated PTB domain of CBL (G306E) and decreased by mutation of tyrosines 589 and 591 in the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3. A constitutive active AKT mutant (E17K) recapitulates the CBL deletion mutant induced phenotype in Ba/F3 cells. CBL is a selective negative regulator of class III RTK receptors and the PI3K/AKT pathway is critical for the transforming potential of the CBL oncogene. An alternative mechanism for the constitutive activation of RTKs in tumors occurs through inactivation of a negative regulator. CBL mutants mirror the phenotype of oncogenic RTK and cause an enhanced AKT phosphorylation. Targeted inhibition of FLT3 and AKT might be of therapeutic value in AML patients carrying CBL deletion mutants.
