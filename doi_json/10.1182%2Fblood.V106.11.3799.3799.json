    "abstract_text": "Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) involving the circle of Willis and documented using time-averaged maximum velocity (TAMM) on transcranial Doppler (TCD) and on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), is common in sickle cell anemia (SCA). Few studies have examined the natural history of CVD. The relationship between TAMM and MRA turbulence is also unclear. We aimed to examine time trends in TAMM and any relationship with clinical stroke and silent infarction (SI) on MRI. We also wanted to determine (a) the degree of MRA turbulence associated with TCD V>200 cm/sec (b) the TCD signature of MRA occlusion and (c) the proportion of patients with no TCD signal who did not have MRA occlusion. TCD was performed in a cohort of 169 patients with highest TAMM measured in either internal carotid/middle cerebral artery recorded (time point 1). Studies were categorised as follows: 0=normal TAMM, 1=170\u2013200cm/sec (conditional TAMM), 2=>200cm/sec, 3=200cm/sec; 3 had not been screened for SCD neonatally. 11 (7%) patients had abnormally low TAMM 200cm/s at time point 1 had TAMM<50cm/s at time point 2 and 3/5 patients with TAMM<50cm/s at time point 1 remained low at time point 2. Patients with abnormally high or low TAMM at time point 1 were more likely to have abnormally low TAMM at time point 2 ( x 2 , p= 0.001). Although clinical stroke ( x 2 , p=0.001)and SI were commoner in those with abnormal TCD, the latter relationship was not significant ( x 2 , p=0.94). 92 patients had both TCD and MRA within 1 month. The results were analysed for symptomatic (n=63) and asymptomatic (n=29) groups. There was no difference between groups for age (median 13; range 0\u201327 years). MRAs were examined for evidence of MCA turbulence graded as none, mild, moderate, severe or occlusion. There was a significant association between TAMM and MRA turbulence for the whole (ANOVA, right p=0.0001, left p=0.001), and symptomatic groups (ANOVA, right p=0.01, left p=0.025). All patients with TAMM>200 cm/sec had severe MCA turbulence but 2/3 with TAMM>17080 cm/sec are unlikely to have occlusion. As silent infarction is not predicted by TCD, MRA has a role as an additional tool to identify high risk patients, particularly in those with low TAMM. TAMM>200cm/sec appears to be a screen for severe turbulence, although this condition may represent specific pathophysiology rather than part of a spectrum.",
