    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The analysis of what goes awry in a malignant cell has focused primarily on mutations of protein-encoding genes and their regulatory sequences. However, recent work on microRNA (miRNA) has shed light on the possible involvement of miRNA genes in human disease. miRNA are small \u201cnoncoding\u201d or \u201cnon-messenger\u201d RNAs of about 21\u201325 nucleotides in length that function as regulators of gene expression essentially by pairing to the mRNA of protein-coding genes to initiate mRNA degradation or repression of translation. We are interested in characterizing miRNA expression profiles in human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) and myeloma patient samples. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell tumor characterized by frequent chromosomal translocations. Materials and methods: The expression of miRNA in HMCLs, primary MM cells (hyperdiploid samples) and normal plasma cells was determined using human microRNA chips. The GenoExporer TM Human microRNA chips were developed by GenoSensor (Tempe, AZ) and the microarray contains 226 human microRNA sequences in addition to control sequences. The DNA oligo probes are synthesized and immobilized on the chips (1\u201dx 3\u201d standard glass microslide). The probes are designed based on the active mature miRNA sequences and some of their flanking sequences. Our analysis included seven myeloma patients (hyperdiploid MM), eight different HMCLs (MM1, 8226 with t(14;16); SKMM2, U266, INA-6 with t(11;14) and H929, KMS11, UTMC-2 with t(4;14)), and eight normal human plasma cells. The normal human plasma cells were collected at Mayo Clinic Rochester from bone samples of patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. For the assay 5\u201310 \u03bcg of total RNA per sample were used at a concentration of 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcL. The RNA is directly labeled with biotin and used as a target for the on-chip hybridization assays. A streptavidin-Alexa dye is used to stain the hybridized targets and the fluorescent signals are captured and analyzed. The gene signal intensities were normalized to tRNA signal intensity. Results: The primary MM cells and HMCLs displayed a distinctive miRNA expression profile compared with normal plasma cells. Using the GeneSpring 7 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) for gene expression analysis we have identified miRNA genes with significant variation in expression levels between tumor and normal samples including miR-125b, miR-133a, miR1, and miR-124a (p<0.01). Recently defined algorithms were used to identify putative targets for the miRNA genes of interest such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) as targets of miR-125b and Stat3 and angiopoietin-1 precursor as targets of miR-124a (Lewis et al. 2003). Of note, miR-15 and miR-16, previously identified to be downregulated in CLL, were expressed at low levels in some MM patients and HMCLs, but not in the normal plasma cells. Further analysis will be carried out to validate the data from miRNA profiling using northern blot analysis or real-time RT-PCR to measure expression levels of miRNA genes and that of their target genes. Conclusion: Analysis of miRNA expression pattern (along with aCGH and gene expression profiling studies) will undoubtedly refine our understanding of the various genotypic subtypes of multiple myeloma.",
