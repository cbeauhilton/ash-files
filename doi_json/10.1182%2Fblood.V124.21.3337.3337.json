    "abstract_text": "Introduction New therapies are needed for patients (pts) with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). BCL2 is an anti-apoptotic protein that is overexpressed in CLL and may be associated with resistance to available therapies; GDC-0199 is an orally available, selective BCL2 inhibitor. The combination of bendamustine (B) and rituximab (R) has demonstrated efficacy in relapsed/refractory (R/R) and previously untreated pts with CLL and is often used in these pts. Preclinical data suggest that GDC-0199 combined with BR may show synergistic activity in CLL. Moreover, clinical data from single-agent studies of GDC-0199, and in combination with rituximab in pts with CLL, support combining GDC-0199 with BR in this population. Data presented here are from an ongoing phase 1b study that is evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of GDC-0199 when given in combination with BR, as well as the safety, tolerability, and order of administration of this combination in R/R or previously untreated pts with CLL. Methods Pts with an ECOG PS \u22641, adequate marrow, hepatic, renal and coagulation function are being enrolled in dose finding cohorts ranging from 100 to 600 mg/day of GDC-0199 using a 3+3 dose escalation design. Pts are assigned to one of two dosing schedules ( Figure 1 ) with GDC-0199 (Schedule A) or BR (Schedule B) introduced first, both incorporating a gradual dose ramp-up of GDC-0199 to reduce the risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Prophylaxis measures to mitigate TLS include IV hydration, treatment to prevent hyperuricemia and hospitalization. After completing combination therapy, R/R pts will continue single-agent GDC-0199 until disease progression. Previously untreated pts will continue single-agent GDC-0199 for up to 18 months. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) data are identified after all pts in a cohort have completed \u00b321 days of combination treatment at the target dose of GDC-0199 and focus on treatment emergent TLS and cytopenias. Figure 1 View large Download slide Figure 1 View large Download slide Results As of May 2014, 6 pts with R/R CLL have been enrolled in the dose finding stage of the study with a median time on study of 67 (range 43-113) days. All 6 pts were enrolled on Schedule A; 3 pts were enrolled in the 100 mg GDC-0199 cohort and 3 pts were enrolled in the 200 mg cohort. Baseline characteristics of the 6 pts are as follows: median age 67 (range 52-71) years, 3 male pts, median of 2 prior CLL therapies (range 1-3, including 4 pts with previous exposure to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab [FCR] and 1 with previous exposure to FCR and B), beta-2 microglobulin \u22653.5 mg/L in 2 pts, and unmutated IGHV in 5 pts. Prior to starting therapy, the median lymphocyte count was 40.85 x 10 9 cells/L (range 2.11-169 x 10 9 cells/L), hemoglobin level was 101.5 g/L (range 99-134 g/L), neutrophil count was 2.54 cells/\u03bcL (range 1.81-3.8 cells/\u03bcL), and platelet count was 83.5 x 10 9 /L (range 49-250 x 10 9 /L). Pts were assigned to 1 of 3 TLS risk groups based on screening ALC and tumor bulk: low risk 1 pt, medium risk 4 pts, and high risk 1 pt. Cytogenetic data are available for 3 pts: 1 pt had del17p, 2 pts had del 11q, and 3 pts had del 13q. No DLTs were observed. All 6 pts have experienced adverse events (AEs, Figure 2 ). The most common AE was anemia with most Grade \u00b33 AEs being hematological toxicities ( Figure 2 ). One serious AE of bronchitis was observed in a pt enrolled in the 100 mg GDC-0199 cohort and resolved after treatment. Two pts in the 100 mg GDC-0199 cohort discontinued BR after the 21-day DLT window secondary to treatment emergent cytopenia: 1 with neutropenia after completing 1 cycle of BR (previous treatment FCR without baseline cytopenia) and the second with thrombocytopenia after completing 3 cycles of BR (previous treatment FCR and chlorambucil with thrombocytopenia at screening). Both pts remain on single-agent GDC-0199. No TLS events (laboratory or clinical) were observed and no deaths reported. Figure 2 View large Download slide Figure 2 View large Download slide Conclusion This is the first study to evaluate the combination of GDC-0199 and BR in pts with CLL. Despite 5 pts being identified as medium or high risk for TLS, no pts developed TLS as a result of the ramp-up dosing of GDC-199 and prophylactic measures. The most frequent AEs were hematological toxicities and generally manageable; however, 2 pts had to discontinue BR (after 1 and 3 cycles) but were able to remain on GDC-0199. Dose escalation in R/R pts is continuing in order to evaluate the optimal dose/schedule with a plan to enroll previously untreated pts in the near future.
