We investigated the prognostic impact of these genetic abnormalities, detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), on the outcome in patients who underwent allogeneic SCT. Patients and methods: This is a retrospective study performed in 20 centres for a total of 175 patients, using the database register of the SFGM-TC and the cytogenetic files of the IFM and MAG groups. The median age of the population at diagnosis was 51 years (range, 28-62 years). FISH analysis was performed either at diagnosis or at relapse before allograft. Chromosomal abnormalities were found in 127 of 175 patients (73%), distributed as follows (in percent of patients evaluable for each abnormality): 59% for del (13q), 26% for t (4;14), 25% for del (17p), 24% for t (11;14) and 4% for t (14;16). Be\u0301ta2microglobuline was superior to 4 mg/L in 51% and more than 92% had received at least one prior high-dose therapy followed by autologous SCT. Forty percent of patients were transplanted in the first course of the disease. Most patients (79%) received two or less lines of treatments before transplantation. Prior treatments included thalidomide and bortezomib in, respectively, 25% and 27% of cases. At transplant, 12% of patients were in complete response (CR), 6% in very good partial response (VGPR), 66% in partial response (PR), 8% in stable disease (SD) and 8% in progressive disease (PD). The median time from diagnosis to transplant was 15 months (range, 4-175 months). Seventy seven percent of patients received reduced conditioning regimen, including antithymoglobulin (ATG) in 52% of cases. Peripheral blood and bone marrow were used as the source of cells in 78% and 19%, respectively. Most donors (69%) were match related donors. Results: Best response to transplant was CR, VGPR, PR, SD and PD in, respectively, 38%, 12%, 33%, 7% and 10% (among 130 patients with available data). With a median follow-up of 36 months, the 3-year progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 34% and 52%, respectively. Three-year post-transplant progression occurred in 53%. One-year transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 21%. Grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) was present in 33%. Limited and extensive chronic GvHD occurred respectively in 16% and 23% of evaluable patients. In univariate analysis, del (13q), t (4;14) and del (17p) had no impact on the PFS, OS and progression. Three-year PFS and OS were, respectively, 39% and 53% for del (13q), 29% and 38% for del (17p), 26% and 38% for t (4;14), 25% and 43% for t (11;14), 31% and 45% for the group of patients without any of these cytogenetic abnormalities. Patients transplanted in the first course of the disease with t (4;14) ( n=14 ) and with del (17p) ( n=6 ) had a 3-year PFS of 36% and 44%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, better PFS was significantly associated with younger age ( P = 0.02, HR=1.1), sensitive disease status at transplant ( P =0.04, HR=0.55) and two or less prior lines of treatments ( P <0.001, HR=0.3); better OS was associated with younger age and two or less prior lines of treatments (respectively, P =0.01, HR=1.1; and P =0.02, HR=0.5). Conclusion: These data suggest no impact of genetic abnormalities after allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma and did not confirm the encouraging results of allogeneic SCT for t (4;14) myeloma (Schilling et al., Leukemia , 2008). More studies are warranted to better define the possible role of early allograft in poor prognostic myeloma and to further develop risk-adapted strategy based on cytogenetics.
