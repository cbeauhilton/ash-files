    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3909 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is a hematological malignancy of mature B cells and constitutes the most common leukemia in adults. It is characterized by a progressive accumulation of clonal B cells, which coexpress CD19, CD23 and CD5. The clinical course of CLL can be predicted by serveral prognostic markers like CD38, ZAP70 and cytogenetic abnormalities. While the treatment of CLL has significantly improved during recent years, it remains an essentially uncurable disease and the molecular events that lead to its development are still largely ellusive. NFAT is a family of highly phosphorylated transcription factors residing in the cytoplasm of resting cells. Upon dephosphorylation NFAT proteins translocate to the nucleus where they orchestrate developmental and activation programs in diverse cell types. NFAT is inactivated by a network of several kinases. Several recent studies have demonstrated that Ca 2+ /NFAT signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of a wide array of different tumor types including pancreatic adenocarcinoma, breast cancer and Non Hodgkin\u2032s lymphoma. In this study we investigated the significance of the Ca 2+ /NFAT signaling pathway in B-CLL. For this purpose, we analyzed CLL cell lines (MEC-1, JVM-3) as well as primary blood samples from patients with CLL (n=30). The analyzed patient population exhibited a representative distribution of age, sex, Binet stage, WBC count, cytogenetics and IGVH mutational status. PBMC were obtained by ficoll density gradient centrifugation and B cells were subsequently isolated using magnetic bead technology. NFAT2 expression and aberrant nuclear translocation was then assessed by Western Blotting and Immunofluorescence staining. In addition, NFAT2 mRNA levels were measured by qRT-PCR and its DNA binding capacity was assessed using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Transcriptional activity of NFAT2 proteins in CLL cells was further analyzed by determining the expression of several well characterized NFAT target genes by qRT-PCR and Western Blotting. In our analysis, we detected a profound overexpression of NFAT2 mRNA as well as NFAT2 protein in all CLL samples. Using qRT-PCR we found that CD19 + CD5 + CLL cells exhibited an at least three fold overexpression of NFAT2 as compared to CD19 + B cells isolated from healthy donors. In one case, NFAT2 expression in CLL cells was 200 times higher than in the corresponding control cell population. This profound overexpression of NFAT2 in CLL cells could be confirmed on the protein level using Western Blotting and Immunocytochemistry. We could further demonstrate that even under resting conditions significant amounts of NFAT2 protein had translocated to the nucleus in CLL cells, whereas virtually all NFAT2 was in the cytoplasm in healthy B cells. NFAT2 nuclear translocation could be inhibited using pretreatment with Cyclosporin A demonstrating that this process was still calcineurin-dependent in CLL cells. We could further show that nuclear NFAT2 in CLL cells was able to bind DNA but that its transcriptional activity with respect to several apoptosis and cell cycle regulating genes was severely compromised when compared with healthy CD19 + CD5 + B cells. In summary, these results provide strong evidence that the Ca 2+ /NFAT signaling axis is con-stitutively activated in CD19 + CD5 + CLL cells. Reduced expression of several apoptosis and cell cycle regulating proteins which are known target genes of NFAT2 potentially links deregulation of this signaling cascade to CLL progression. This is in line with our observation that genetic loss of NFAT2 can induce acceleration of CLL in TCL1 mouse model. Further investigation is warranted to decipher the therapeutic potential of modulating Ca 2+ /Calcineurin/NFAT signaling in CLL. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
