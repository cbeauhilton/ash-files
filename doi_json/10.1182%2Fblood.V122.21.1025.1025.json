    "abstract_text": "Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by defective production and viability of neutrophil granulocytes and predisposition to life-threatening bacterial infections. Currently, OMIM lists five defined monogenic SCN: SCN1 ELANE , SCN2 GFI1 , SCN3 HAX1 , SCN4 G6PC3 . Here, we describe a novel SCN subtype (SCN6) caused by recessively-inherited loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the granulocyte colony-stimulating receptor ( CSF3R ). We have identified four affected children in two distinct families. Family A had a homozygous missense mutation in close proximity of the highly conserved WSXWS motif (c.922T, p.Arg308Cys) and family B had two compound heterozygous small deletions provoking frameshift mutations (p.Gly316fs and p.Gly415fs). Mutated G-CSFR p.Arg308Cys protein was characterized by perturbed N-glycosylation and aberrant localization to cell surface. G-CSF induced phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 was greatly diminished. In contrast to other SCN subtypes, all patients had morphological evidence of full myeloid cell maturation in bone marrow. However, none of the patients responded to granulocyte colony-stimulating growth factor (GCSF) treatment in vivo, confirming aberrant GCSF-receptor dependent signaling. Our studies highlight the genetic and morphological variability of SCN and provide evidence both for functional importance and redundancy of G-CSFR-mediated signaling in human granulopoiesis.
