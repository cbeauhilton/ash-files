    "abstract_text": "Abstract 984 Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital bone marrow failure syndrome, characterized by red blood cell aplasia, macrocytic anemia, and increased risk of malignancy. Approximately 90% of patients present during the first year of life or in early childhood. About 40\u201350% of DBA cases are familial with autosomal dominant, while the remainder is sporadic cases whose mode of inheritance is largely unknown. Although anemia is the most prominent feature of DBA, up to 40% of patients also accompany other symptoms including growth retardation and/or a variety of congenital malformations. Recent studies have shown that the disease could be associated with heterozygous mutations in ribosomal protein (RP) genes, including six small subunit RP genes RPS7 , RPS10 , RPS17 , RPS19 , RPS24 , and RPS26 as well as four large subunit RP genes RPL5, RPL11 , RPL26 , and RPL35A , which collectively account for about 50% of patients with DBA. In addition, germline mutations in the GATA1 gene encoding a hematopoietic transcription factor, have been also reported in two DBA families. However, it is clear that the molecular etiology of many DBA cases remains to be covered. To identify new mutations that are responsible for DBA, we performed whole-exome sequencing on 40 DBA patients with no documented mutations/deletions involving known DBA genes. After excluding all variants registered in the 1000 Genomes Project, or dbSNP131, or found in our inhouse SNP database, we searched for non-synonymous mutations involving RP genes as possible candidate for novel DBA genes. In this study, we identified probable pathogenic mutations in two novel RP genes, RPS27 and RPL27 in two patients. The first case was a 1-year-old girl who harbored a single nucleotide substitution at the splice acceptor site in intron 1 of RPL27 (c.-2\u20131G>A), which results in splicing error. She had atrial septal defect and pulmonary stenosis, and responded to steroid treatment. The second case was a 2-year-old girl carrying a frameshift deletion of RPS27 (c.90delC, p.Tyr31ThrfsX5), leading to a premature truncation. This patient had no abnormalities and responded to steroid treatment. An additional five missense SNVs affecting single cases was identified in five genes, including RPL3L , RPL8 , RPL13 , RPL18A , and RPL31 , together with two in-frame deletions of RPL6 and RPL14 in two patients, which cause deletion of a single amino-acid. However, the pathological significance in these 7 cases is uncertain. In the remaining 31 patients, no mutations were detected in RP genes. In conclusion, we identified novel germline mutations of RP genes that could be responsible for DBA, further confirming the concept that the RP genes are common targets of germline mutations in DBA patients and also suggested the presence of non-RP gene targets for DNA.
