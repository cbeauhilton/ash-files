    "abstract_text": "The t(11;17)(q23;q21) translocation involves the production of reciprocal fusion proteins PLZF-RAR\u03b1 and RAR\u03b1-PLZF, which mediate malignant transformation by binding to and dysregulating RAR\u03b1/RXR and PLZF target genes, respectively. In order to investigate the molecular basis for PLZF-RAR\u03b1 induced leukemogenesis, we used a gain of function model in which PLZF-RAR\u03b1 was ectopically expressed in U937 leukemia cells. After demonstrating in our system that PLZF-RAR\u03b1 is capable of inducing a G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibiting cell growth and myeloid differentiation, we sought to identify genes directly bound and transcriptionally regulated by PLZF-RAR\u03b1. Chromatin from U937PLZF-RAR\u03b1 expressing cells (+10nM RA) was immunoprecipitated using PLZF antibodies, amplified by ligation-mediated PCR and biological triplicates were hybridized to NimbleGen 2.7kB promoter arrays, which represent 24,275 human promoters. We identified 1797 genes that are directly bound by PLZF-RAR\u03b1 in at least 2 out of 3 arrays, and the majority of these genes (89%) are also bound in the absence of exogenously added RA. Quantitative real time PCR using primary ChIP samples was used to validate ChIP-on-CHIP results and all genes tested to date (n=11) were confirmed as direct targets of PLZF-RAR\u03b1. Ontological analyses of genes identified by ChIP-on-CHIP revealed enrichment for genes involved in myeloid cell functions including immune, inflammatory and defense responses, in addition to genes involved in apoptosis and signal transduction pathways. Furthermore, genes encoding nuclear proteins were also highly enriched and these included previously identified RAR\u03b1/RXR target genes (ie. CEBP\u03b5, RAR\u03b22, PRAM1, NFE-2), which are likely targeted by the PLZF-RAR\u03b1 oncoprotein, as well as novel PLZF-RAR\u03b1 targets, many of which have roles in blood cell development and have been implicated in leukemia (ie. RUNX1, MLL2, MCL1, PIM1, FANCB). Of these 1797 genes, a significant percentage (22%) are also transcriptionally regulated by PLZF-RAR\u03b1 (>1.5 fold, p2 fold, p<0.03). In U937 cells, PLZF-RAR\u03b1 repressed RUNX1, KLF10 and ID1 in the absence of exogenous RA. Intriguingly, RUNX1, KLF10 and ID2 were also identified as direct target genes of PLZF in the KG1a cell line and were transcriptionally regulated by PLZF in U937 cells, suggesting that PLZF and PLZF-RAR\u03b1 may co-regulate a subset of target genes. Given the roles of RUNX1, KLF10, ID1 and ID2 in myeloid differentiation and growth inhibition, these genes may represent PLZF-RAR\u03b1 specific targets that potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of t(11;17) APL.",
