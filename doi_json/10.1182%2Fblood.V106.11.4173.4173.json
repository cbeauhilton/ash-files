    "abstract_text": "Arterial compliance disturbances are frequently observed among patients with chronic anemia. Few non-invasive studies were performed to determine hemodynamic changes in anemic patient. In this work we studied parameters of large arteries (C1) and small arteries (C2) compliance before and after blood transfusion (one packed cells unit(400cc)) by CR 2000 Hypertension Diagnostics Inc/Pulse Wave (Minneapolis MN, USA). We included 20 patients with chronic transfusion dependent anemia. The median age was 74\u00b16 years. Twelve patients had MDS, 1 CML, 2 myelofibrosis, 2 NHL, one CLL, one thalassemia, and one patient with anemia of chronic disease. Hemoglobin range before transfusion was 7.5\u20139.0 g/dl. 14 patients also suffered from arterial hypertension, 5 from diabetes mellitus and received oral treatment; eight patients were smokers. Large arterial compliance before hemotransfusion was 9.8\u00b13.8 ml/mmHgx10, and 9.2\u00b12.9 after hemotransfusion (p<0.05). Small arterial compliance before and after blood transfusion were without significant changes (2.8\u00b11.2 ml/mmHgx10 and 3.04\u00b11.2 ml/mmHgx10 respectively). The decrease in C1 is explained by increased blood pressure. Systolic blood pressure rose from 135\u00b117mmHg to 152\u00b126mmHg (p<0.05), and diastolic pressure rose from 65\u00b18mmHg to 72\u00b110mmHg(p<0.05). In conclusion, hemotransfusion of one packed cells for patients with chronic anemia led to significant decrease in large artery compliance most probably due to increase in blood pressure and blood volume. Hemotransfusion increases the small artery compliance but not significantly.",
