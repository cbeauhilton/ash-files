    "abstract_text": "Background: V617F mutation in Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) gene has been found in chronic myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) including polycythemia vera (90%), essential thrombocythemia and chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (30\u201350%), and occasionally in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). \u201c5q- Syndrome\u201d is a MDS that shares features with MPD and characterized by an atypical megakaryocytic hyperplasia in bone marrow and usually thrombocytosis in peripheral blood. The most common deleted region for this syndrome is 5q13.3q33.1. An interstitial deletion with variable proximal (5q12-14) and distal (5q31-33) breakpoints has been found in other MDS with/without additional chromosomal abnormalities beyond \u201c5q- Syndrome\u201d. To date, JAK2 mutation was detected in 6/97(6.2%) of patients having diagnosis of MDS with \u201c5q- Syndrome\u201d. Design: In our study 21 MDS patients (10 with \u201c5q- Syndrome\u201d and 11 MDS with isolated or complex 5q-) whose diagnosis by both bone marrow aspiration/biopsy and conventional chromosomal analysis were confirmed. Materials and Method: Primers were created to amplify a 460 bp fragment containing the site of JAK2 V617F mutation. Forty-five cycles of PCR were performed at an annealing temperature of 57\u00b0C. Resulting PCR product was digested with 2 U BsaXI for 16 hours and with an additional 2 U BsaXI for another 16 hours at 37\u00b0C, then analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. The mutant allele remained undigested whereas the wild-type allele was digested into 241 bp, 189 bp and 30 bp fragments. All experiments included a positive (HEL cells) and negative (K562 cells) control. Results: PCR results showed clear wild type PCR patterns in all 21 cases. Conclusion: No JAK2 mutations were detected in 21 patients either with \u201c5q- Syndrome\u201d or other 5q- associated MDS suggesting that JAK2 mutations are infrequent in these MDS patients."
