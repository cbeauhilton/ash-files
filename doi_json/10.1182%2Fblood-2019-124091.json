    "abstract_text": "Background: Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) based liver transduction has emerged as a potentially viable gene therapy approach for the treatment of hemophilia patients. Fidanacogene elaparvovec (previously SPK-9001) is a hepatotropic bioengineered AAV based vector that delivers a high activity factor IX (FIX) transgene driven by a liver specific promoter. The Phase 1/2a development consists of a dosing study where patients are followed for 52 weeks post vector infusion followed by a long-term follow-up study for an additional 5 years. Data on the first 10 patients were previously published and demonstrated safe and sustained expression of a high activity FIX protein with an associated decreased requirement for exogenous factor administration and markedly reduced annualized bleeding rate. Here we present data on 15 patients infused with fidanacogene elaparvovec with \u2265 1 year of follow-up, which represents the largest cohort of Hemophilia B (HB) patients treated with the same vector at the same dose. Methods: Fifteen (15) adult HB patients were infused with 5 x 10 11 vg/kg of fidanacogene elaparvovec and followed for at least 1 year as part of the Phase 1/2a dosing study. FIX activity (FIX:C) levels were measured using a one-stage assay. Endpoints include: Safety and tolerability, steady-state activity calculated as the geometric mean of all observed FIX:C activity levels from week 12 through week 52; annualized bleeding rate (ABR) prior to and 52 weeks after vector infusion; T cell response to fidanacogene elaparvovec capsid and transgene monitored post-infusion using an interferon-\u03b3 enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay. Results: Three of fifteen patients were treated with corticosteroids for elevations in hepatic transaminases of which 2 were positive for capsid reactive T cells by interferon-\u03b3 ELISpot. There were otherwise no treatment related adverse events. The mean post-infusion steady-state FIX:C was 22.9%\u00b19.9% at 1 year post vector infusion as measured in a central laboratory by one-stage assay utilizing Actin-FSL. Mean ABR during the first 52 weeks following fidanacogene elaparvovec infusion was 0.4\u00b11.1 compared to 8.9\u00b114.0 in the 52 weeks preceding infusion (p<0.001). Twelve (12) out of 15 patients reported zero bleeds in the 52 weeks post-vector infusion. Five of 15 subjects infused factor for a total of 20 infusions. Additional follow-up data will be presented for all patients enrolled in the long-term follow-up study. Conclusions: Fidanacogene elaparvovec was well tolerated in 15 patients with no serious adverse events. Data for all patients at 52 weeks post-infusion demonstrated a marked reduction in bleeding frequency and exogenous FIX use. All hepatic transaminase elevations responded to treatment with corticosteroids. Collectively, to date, this represents the largest cohort of HB patients treated with the same AAV based gene therapy and at the lowest dose. Treatment has been efficacious for all patients with manageable immune responses when present. These data support progression to a pivotal Phase 3 study at the dose evaluated.
