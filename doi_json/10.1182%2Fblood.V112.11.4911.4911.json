    "abstract_text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV), being lymphotrophic as well as hepatotrophic, has been reported to induce B-cell proliferative disorders such as mixed cryoglobulinemia and B-cell lymphoma. To investigate the association between HCV and B-cell proliferation, we evaluated the incidence and characteristics of monoclonal B cells in the circulating blood of HCV-infected cases relative to controls with non-HCV hepatic diseases. We first evaluated the surface immunoglobulin \u03ba:\u03bb light-chain ratios of the circulating B (CD19+) cells in 240 HCV-infected cases and 150 controls. Light chain restriction (\u03ba:\u03bb ratio >3:1 or < 1:2) was detected in 7 cases with HCV (2.9%) (Table 1), but was never detected in the controls ( p <0.05). As these monoclonal B cells were not identified morphologically, they were analyzed for CD5/CD20 expression. None of them showed the so-called chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)-phenotype cells. The clonal and normal B cells did not differ significantly in their intensity of CD5 expression (Figure 1). The B-cell clonality was confirmed in all 7 cases by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( IgH ) gene rearrangements and the t(14;18) fusion gene was detected in one case. The loss of clonality was observed in 2 cases treated with interferon and in one case treated with splenectomy. The longitudinal study is required to determine whether these circulating monoclonal B cells progress to lymphoproliferative disorders or not. Table 1.
