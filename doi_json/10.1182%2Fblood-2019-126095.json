    "abstract_text": "Background: Previous articles have identified the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) as an integral part in the formation of coated platelets. Coated platelets are preactivated platelets featuring degranulation, increased fibrinogen binding, and increased serine protease activity leading to fibrin generation. Furthermore, phosphatidylserine exposure is increased and integrin \u03b12b\u03b2III is inhibited - leading to a prothrombotic phenotype despite decreased platelet aggregation. We hypothesize that bile acids, as natural ligands of FXR, lead to a change of platelet phenotype and therefore play a pivotal role in the formation of coated platelets, especially in presence of cholestasis. Methods: Based on previous findings, we incubated human washed platelets of healthy adult volunteers with the synthetic FXR ligand GW4064 in various concentrations (0, 10, 20, 50, 100\u00b5M) and used flow cytometry to detect a shift in p-selectin expression, PAC-1 binding and annexin-V-binding. Moreover, we used different concentrations (0, 100, 200, 400, 600\u00b5M) of three bile acids (ursodeoxycholic acid, UDCA; chenodeoxycholic acid, CDCA; glycochenodeoxycholic acid, GCDCA) to see if natural FXR ligands induce an effect on the platelet phenotype. Results: We observed a dose dependent shift in annexin-V-binding when treating washed platelets with GW4064 as well as CDCA and GCDCA. Similarly, GW4064 led to increased p-selectin expression while increased PAC-1-binding was only detected at the highest concentration. In contrast, CDCA and GCDCA showed merely slight changes in p-selectin expression whereas PAC-1-binding seemed to be unaffected. However, none of these effects were seen when using UDCA. Conclusion: We conclude that pretreatment of washed platelets with CDCA and GCDCA initiate a dose-dependent shift towards a prothrombotic platelet phenotype. Therefore, we assume that increased levels of certain bile acids drive thrombosis in patients with cholestatic liver injury. Furthermore, a recent mouse model study suggested that platelet derived growth factor \u03b2 (PDGF\u03b2), a component of \u03b1-granula, drives liver fibrosis. Hence, in addition to their prothrombotic effects, coated platelets might exacerbate liver fibrosis. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
