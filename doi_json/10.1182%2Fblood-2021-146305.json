In severe cases, excess oxidative stress produced by a 'cytokine storm' may generate excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lead to tissue damage in the lungs and elsewhere. As the potential role of RBCs in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 remains controversial (1), we investigated for evidence of increased oxidative stress and increased thrombotic tendency in RBCs from patients with COVID-19 infection. Following ethical approval and written informed consent, we used flow cytometry (BD FACSCanto II) to measure baseline RBC ROS following incubation with 2'-7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF). RBC ROS were also measured following pre-incubation with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (2mM) +/- antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) (0.6mM). We also measured RBC surface expression of adhesion molecules CD44, CD47 and CD242, as well as CD147. Results were expressed as mean +/- standard deviation (SD). RBC ROS were measured in 22 COVID-19 positive patients and in 10 age matched healthy controls. One patient died from respiratory failure, whilst only 3 others required ITU admission for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or intubation. There was no statistical difference in mean basal RBC DCF mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) levels between COVID-19 positive patients and controls. However, mean increase in RBC DCF MFI following H2O2 incubation was significantly higher in the COVID-19 positive group (1105.7+/-336.3) compared to the control group (843.4+/-256.7)( p= 0.042). The increase in RBC DCF MFI in the COVID-19 positive group correlated with CRP (p=0.014) but not with D-dimer, serum ferritin or any complete blood count (CBC) parameters. Incubation of RBC with 0.6 mM NAC for 30 minutes prior to H2O2 exposure caused a mean reduction in DCF MFI of 26.7% in the COVID-19 positive group. RBC expression of CD44, CD47, CD242 and CD147 were measured In a separate cohort of COVID-19 positive patients (n=32), and in 22 age matched controls. There were no statistically significant differences in mean expression levels of CD44, CD47 and CD242 between the 2 groups. However, mean RBC CD147 MFI expression was higher in the COVID-19 group (1319.64+/-374.76) compared to controls (1061.59+/-253.33) (p=0.018). There was no significant correlation between RBC CD147 MFI and D-dimer, CRP, serum ferritin or any CBC parameters in the COVID-19 positive group. However, 21 of the 32 COVID-19 positive patients had blood lactate levels measured and there was a positive correlation between CD147 MFI expression and blood lactate (R=0.56, p=0.0077). Induction of oxidative stress by H2O2 resulted in a greater increase in ROS in RBCs from COVID-19 patients compared to controls and with correlation to CRP, despite the fact that there were very few patients with severe disease in the study. This suggests a role for oxidative stress in disease pathogenesis. Pre-incubation with NAC attenuated this increase in ROS, suggesting a possible role for antioxidants in therapy. Increased RBC cell surface expression of adhesion molecules CD44, CD47 and CD242 can facilitate RBC interaction with platelets and/or endothelial cells, potentially contributing to thrombosis. We found no increase in their expression in COVID-19 patients compared to controls although RBCs may contribute to thrombosis in COVID-19 infection by other means (1). CD147 is tightly associated with and enables proper expression of monocarboxylate transporter 1, the lactate transporter for RBCs. We found increased surface expression of CD147 on RBCs of COVID-19 patients, whilst CD147 expression showed a moderate correlation with serum lactate levels, suggesting that RBCs in COVID-19 infection may be acting as a lactate sink to protect against lactic acidosis. In summary, our study suggests that COVID-19 infection causes increased oxidative stress and increased lactate influx in RBCs. Further studies are warranted into the role of RBCs in COVID-19 infection. Reference: (1) Murphy P, Glavey S, Quinn J. Anemia and red blood cell abnormalities in COVID-19.
