Patients and Methods The impact of surveillance imaging on diagnosis of first relapse and outcomes was determined by analysis of a defined patient population with relapsed HL who underwent high dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue (HDT/ASCR). We retrospectively identified 114 patients from the HDT/ASCR database with biopsy-confirmed, relapsed HL; 94 patients had adequate data and follow-up for inclusion in the analysis. Details of surveillance imaging were obtained including: frequency; type; indication; and results of post-remission imaging. The indication for imaging was classified as asymptomatic surveillance (AS) or clinically indicated (CI; i.e. to investigate symptoms or physical examination findings). We have previously reported a validated prognostic model for relapsed HL that found time from initial therapy, presence of B symptoms at relapse and extra-nodal disease at relapse to be adverse factors (Moskowitz et al. Blood 97:616). We determined the prognostic risk group (PRG) (low [L] 0-1 factor, intermediate [I] 2 factors, high risk [H] 3 factors) for all patients. Overall and failure-free survivals were determined using the methods of Kaplan and Meier. Results Patient characteristics included: median age 32 years; PRG L: 65%, I: 31%, H: 4%; AS 36 (38%), CI 58 (62%). The median follow-up for surviving patients was 7.4 years. The PRG (L, I/H) correlated to outcome, validating its applicability in this patient cohort: FFS at 5 years was 64.8% and 49.4% respectively, p=0.045. PRGs were evenly distributed between the AS and CI groups: L: 64% v 66%; I/H: 36% v 37% p=0.48. The FFS at 5 years for patients in the AS and CI groups was 58.4% and 59.3% respectively, p=0.9; similar there was no difference in 5 year OS, AS 62.4% and CI 73.3% p=0.6. Within a given risk group (L or I/H) patients in the AS group did not have a superior outcome compared to the CI group. Conclusion AS does not identify a group of patients with first relapse of HL with a more favorable risk profile according the MSKCC prognostic model. While nearly 40% of patients were identified with relapse as a consequence of AS imaging, this did not identify a group of patients with relapsed HL with improved outcomes compared to patients who had CI imaging. If these results are confirmed in a prospective study, AS may be safely eliminated in HL after remission to reduce cost and long-term risk of the diagnostic imaging.
