    "abstract_text": "Reduced levels of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27 Kip1 connote poor prognosis in cancer. In human Burkitt lymphoma, and in pre-cancerous B cells and lymphomas arising in E\u03bc- Myc transgenic mice, p27 Kip1 expression is markedly reduced. Furthermore, the Cks1 component of the SCF Skp2 complex that is necessary for p27 Kip1 ubiquitylation and degradation, and to a lesser extent Skp2, are induced by Myc ex vivo and in E\u03bc- Myc B-cells and lymphomas, and up-regulation of CKS1 and SKP2 are hallmarks of Burkitt lymphoma. While loss of Skp2 has rather modest effects, the deletion of Cks1 in E\u03bc- Myc B-cells elevates p27 Kip1 levels, reduces proliferation and delays lymphoma development. In contrast, Myc-induced apoptosis and transcriptional activity are not affected by Cks1 (or Skp2 ) loss. Therefore, Myc accelerates cell proliferation and promotes tumorigenesis through its ability to selectively induce Cks1.",
