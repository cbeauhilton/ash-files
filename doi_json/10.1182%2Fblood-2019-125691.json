    "abstract_text": "Background : Genetic variants resulting in quantitative defects in the production of \u03b1-spectrin are associated with autosomal recessive hereditary spherocytosis (HS). Because erythroid cells produce \u03b1-spectrin in a 3-4:1 ratio in relation to \u03b2-spectrin, one defective allele is typically well-tolerated and a single null allele combined with a second partially defective allele may display a sub-clinical phenotype. Protein expression can be reduced by nonsense, frameshift, missense or splicing variants but reported large deletion events are extraordinarily rare (n = 1). Splicing variants include the low expression alleles \u03b1 LELY - Low Expression LYon ( SPTA1 :c.6531-12C>T, p.?) and \u03b1 LEPRA-Low Expression PRAgue ( SPTA1 :c.4339-99C>T, p.?) which reduce protein expression by 50% and 16%, respectively. Here, we present a family study with a whole gene SPTA1 deletion that characterizes the patient phenotype when a full gene mutation is co-inherited with the \u03b1 LEPRA and \u03b1 LELY low expression alleles. Methods : The 6 month-old male proband had a history of congenital Coombs negative hemolytic anemia requiring transfusion from 3 months of age and in whom a red cell membrane disorder was clinically suspected. Pretransfusion CBC and peripheral blood smear results were unknown. Transfused CBC indices were as follows: RBC 4 x 10 12 /L, HGB 11 g/dL, MCV 76 fL, MCH 27 pg, MCHC 36 g/dL and a reticulocyte count of 1.8%. The proband's mother, of Cuban descent, and father, of European descent, had no history of anemia or HS. Targeted high throughput sequencing of genes related to hereditary hemolytic anemia was performed for the detection of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertion/deletion variants (indels). Relative quantitative real time PCR (RT-PCR) was utilized to confirm large structural variants. Results : Sequencing identified a large heterozygous deletion that spanned the entire SPTA1 gene (NC_000001.11:g.(?_158656337)_(158581024_?) in the proband and his mother. In addition, the proband had inherited hemizygous \u03b1 LEPRA from his father. The mother had hemizgous \u03b1 LELY. The father showed heterozygous \u03b1 LEPRA and no other SPTA1 variants (Table 1). Conclusion : To our knowledge, only Iolascon et al in 2011 has reported a SPTA1 gene large deletion (Spectrin Exeter , exon 11-exon 12 deletion, loss of 83 amino acids) which resulted in a structurally abnormal protein and ellipto-poikilocytosis phenotype when in trans to \u03b1 LELY . Our current case is the first reported SPTA1 full gene deletion and our family study allows comparison of the effects of coinheritance of the low expression alleles \u03b1 LEPRA and \u03b1 LELY . When in combination with complete absence of the SPTA1 gene in trans configuration, \u03b1 LELY manifests in subclinical effects and \u03b1 LEPRA causes a recessive HS phenotype, which resulted in severe anemia. This contrast further demonstrates that, unlike \u03b1 LEPRA , \u03b1 LELY does not decrease the \u03b1-spectrin concentration sufficiently to contribute to the baseline phenotype regardless of the severity of the second allele mutation for quantitative disorders such as HS.
