    "abstract_text": "Background Momelotinib (MMB, previously CYT387) is a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of JAK 1 and JAK 2, and is currently under investigation for the treatment of myelofibrosis (MF). In a Phase 1/2 study of patients with MF, the 300 mg capsule administered once daily was selected as the Phase 3 dose based on a favorable benefit:risk profile. An immediate release tablet formulation (MMB tablet) with better thermodynamic stability and similar biopharmaceutical properties as the capsule formulation (MMB capsule) was developed. \u00a0The relative bioavailability of MMB tablet vs capsule, effect of food on MMB tablet pharmacokinetics (PK), and the effect of omeprazole on MMB tablet PK were evaluated in a Phase 1 study. Methods The MMB tablet (dose: 100 to 300 mg) vs MMB capsule PK (300 mg) was evaluated in a Phase 1, single dose study in healthy subjects.\u00a0 MMB tablet PK at supratherapeutic doses (up to 800 mg), under fed and fasted conditions, and with an acid reducing agent (i.e.,. omeprazole) was also evaluated.\u00a0 Intensive PK and PD sampling occurred from 0.5 hour up to 36 hours post dose. Safety was monitored throughout the study. A parametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) using a mixed-effects model was used to fit to the natural logarithmic transformation of PK parameters (AUC and C max ). The 90% confidence intervals were constructed for the ratio of geometric means of MMB tablet PK at 100, 150, 200 and 300 mg vs MMB capsule 300 mg, using equivalence bounds of 70% to 143% for AUC and C max . A similar approach was used to assess the effect of food or omeprazole. MMB tablet PK at supratherapeutic doses of 400 mg and 800 mg were also evaluated. Results MMB tablet provided plasma exposures that were less-than dose-proportional from 100 mg to 800 mg (Figure 1). MMB tablet at 200 mg provided plasma exposures that were equivalent to MMB capsule at 300 mg (Table 1). Intake of light and high-fat meal modestly increased C max (38% and 28% increase for light and high-fat meals, respectively) and AUC inf (16% and 28% increase for light and high-fat meals, respectively) for MMB tablet. Omeprazole reduced the exposure of MMB tablet by 36% for C max and 31% for AUC inf .\u00a0 These differences were not considered clinically relevant.

MMB tablet plasma exposures increased in a less than dose-proportional manner. No clinically relevant effects of food or acid reducing agent were observed on MMB tablet PK.
