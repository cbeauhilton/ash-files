    "abstract_text": "Abstract 645 Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) are a family of Cys 2 His 2 zinc-finger DNA binding proteins that regulate gene expression through CACCC/GC/GT box binding in various gene promoters. The CACCC element is also critical for developmental regulation of the human \u03b3-globin and \u03b2-globin genes; therefore studies to identify transcription factors that bind the CACCC element to alter gene expression are desirable. By microarray-based gene profiling, we identified two Kruppel-like factors, KLF4 and KLF12 whose expression levels decreased simultaneously with \u03b3-globin silencing during in vitro erythroid maturation. Subsequent reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis confirmed KLF4 and KLF12 mRNA levels decreased 56-fold and 16-fold respectively in erythroid progenitors from day 7 to day 28 with over 90% \u03b3-globin gene silencing. The effects of known fetal hemoglobin inducers hemin (50\u03bcM) and sodium butyrate (2mM) on KLF factor expression was tested in K562 cells. Hemin and sodium butyrate increased KLF4 3-fold (p<0.05) and 13-fold (p<0.01) respectively while KLF12 was only induced by butyrate. Likewise, hemin treatment of KU812 leukemia cells, which actively express \u03b3-globin and \u03b2-globin, produced a 7-fold increase in KLF4 (p<0.05) while KLF12 levels were not changed suggesting KLF4 may be directly involved in \u03b3-globin gene regulation. To characterize its role further siRNA-mediated loss of function studies were performed in K562 cells. A 60% knockdown of KLF4 expression produced 40% attenuation of \u03b3-globin transcription (p<0.05). To confirm this effect, rescue experiments were performed as follows: K562 cells were treated with 100nM siKLF4 alone or in combination with the pMT3-KLF4 expression vector (10 and 20\u03bcg) for 48 hrs. The 40% knockdown of \u03b3-globin expression produced by siKLF4 was rescued to baseline levels after enforced pMT3-KLF4 expression (p<0.05). To establish whether KLF4 directly stimulates \u03b3-globin promoter activity, we performed co-transfection of pMT3-KLF4 and the G\u03b3-promoter (-1500 to +36) cloned into the pGL4.17 Luc2/neo vector; a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity (2- to 5-fold; p<0.001) was observed. Furthermore, enforced expression of pMT3-KLF4 augmented endogenous \u03b3-globin expression 2-fold (p<0.01). Collectively, these studies suggest that KLF4 acts as a trans-activator of \u03b3-globin gene transcription. To address the physiological relevance of these findings, studies were extended to human primary erythroid cells grown in a two-phase liquid culture system. At day 11 when \u03b3-globin gene expression was maximal, siKLF4 treatment produced a 60% decrease in \u03b3/\u03b2-globin mRNA levels (p<0.001). By contrast, enforced pMT3-KLF4 expression enhanced \u03b3/\u03b2-globin 1.5-fold at day 11 and day 28 (after \u03b3-globin silencing); HbF levels were induced 1.5-fold (p<0.05) which was demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To gain insights into the molecular mechanism of KLF4-mediated \u03b3-globin regulation, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) were completed. Since CREB binding protein (CBP) is known to function as a co-activator for KLF1, 4 and 13, we also tested its role in \u03b3-globin gene regulation. EMSA performed with K562 nuclear extract and a [\u03b3- 32 P] labeled \u03b3-CACC probe (-155 to -132 relative to the \u03b3-globin cap site) produced three DNA-protein complexes; the addition of KLF4 or CBP antibody resulted in a marked decrease in intensity of all complexes suggesting these factors bind the \u03b3-CACC element. ChIP assay demonstrated 10-fold and 20-fold chromatin enrichment with KLF4 and CBP antibody respectively (p<0.001) confirming in vivo binding at the \u03b3-CACC region. Lastly, co-immunoprecipitation established protein-protein interaction between KLF4 and CBP in K562 cells. Future studies will investigate the role of CBP in KLF4-mediated \u03b3-globin regulation which will provide molecular targets for fetal hemoglobin induction and treatment of sickle cell anemia and \u03b2-thalassemia.
