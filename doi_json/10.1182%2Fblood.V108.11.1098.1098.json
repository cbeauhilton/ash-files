    "abstract_text": "Glanzmann Thrombasthenia is a recessively inherited hemorrhagic disorder caused by the quantitative or qualitative deficiency of integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23, platelet fibrinogen receptor. We previously analyzed the phenotypic effects of the \u03b1IIbG236E substitution, which is located in a strategic point of the highly organized \u03b1IIb propeller. We demonstrated that the effect of \u03b1IIbG236E is to hamper the association with \u03b23, impairing the correct assembly of the complex. In the present study we analyze the phenotypic effects of two other mutations in the same domain of \u03b1IIb. The first mutation, the \u03b1IIbP258S substitution, is a newly found missense substitution that was identified during a genetic screening of a cohort of patients with Glanzmann Thrombasthenia coming from Southern Iran. The presence of the mutation was confirmed in several family members affected by Glanzmann Thrombasthenia; no other additional mutations were identified. The effect of the substitution is to eliminate the key proline from blade 4 of \u03b1IIb propeller. The second mutation, the \u03b1IIbG349D substitution, has been previously described in an Italian patients with Glanzmann Thrombasthenia. It causes a charge substitution in strand D of blade 5 of the propeller. Both substitutions were inserted by site directed mutagenesis in pCDNA3.1 containing normal \u03b1IIb cDNA. Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells were then transfected by electroporation with normal or mutated \u03b1IIb in conjunction with pCDNA3.1 containing normal \u03b23. After 48 hours cells were analyzed by flow cytometry: the binding of 10E5-FITC (murine anti-human \u03b1IIb\u03b23) in cells expressing \u03b1IIbP258S\u03b23 or \u03b1IIbG349D\u03b23 was approximately at the same level of negative controls (cells transfected with \u03b1IIb only) and greatly reduced in comparison to the binding to cells transfected with normal \u03b1IIb\u03b23. HEK cells transfected with either \u03b1IIb\u03b23 or \u03b1IIbP258S\u03b23 or \u03b1IIbG349D\u03b23 were lysed; cells lysates were analysed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and immunoblotting. All the lysates were reacting at the same level with antibodies directed against \u03b23. When immunoblotting was done in non-reducing conditions utilizing an antibody reacting with \u03b1IIb (mab1990) a band corresponding to \u03b1IIb was present in both lysates, although less intense in cells transfected with mutants \u03b1IIb. In reducing condition \u03b1IIb from cells transfected with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 was nearly all mature, while in cells transfected with \u03b1IIbP258S\u03b23 or \u03b1IIbG349D\u03b23 the ratio pro-\u03b1IIb: \u03b1IIb was 1:1. In conclusion we report the identification of a new mutation responsible for Glanzmann Thrombasthenia located in \u03b1IIb propeller. This mutation, in addition with \u03b1IIbG349D, causes Glanzmann Thrombasthenia interfering with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 complex formation in the endoplasmic reticulum as shown by the increase amount of pro-\u03b1IIb found in cells expressing these mutants.",
