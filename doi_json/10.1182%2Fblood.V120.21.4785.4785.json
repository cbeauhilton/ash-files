Some groups have reported the negative prognostic value of complex karyotype (CK, defined as \u22655 unrelated chromosomal abnormalities) in adult ALL (Moorman et al, Blood. 2007:109;3189-97). On the other hand, monosomal karyotype (MK, defined as \u22652 distinct autosomal chromosome monosomies or 1 single monosomy in the presence of structural abnormalities) has been associated with a worse outcome in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. We aimed to assess the prognostic value of cytogenetic abnormalities, especially CK and MK, in adults with ALL treated with protocols of the Spanish PETHEMA Group. Patients and Methods The karyotypes of 783 adult ALL patients from 63 Spanish centers treated according to the protocols of the PETHEMA Group between 1993 and 2011 were reviewed. The several PETHEMA protocols were risk-adapted (standard-risk \u2013SR\u2013, high-risk \u2013HR\u2013) or subtype-oriented (Philadelphia chromosome [Ph+] ALL -with or without imatinib-, and Burkitt's ALL [BL]). The impact of the main cytogenetic abnormalities as well as of the CK and MK on complete remission (CR) rate, CR duration, overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) was analyzed. Results The median age of the series was 33 years (range 15\u201382) and 448 patients (57.2%) were male. The karyotypes of 560 out of 783 patients were evaluable after review: normal karyotype 153 patients, t(9;22) 120, t(v;11q23) 30, t(8;14), t(8;22) or t(2;8) 47, high hyperdiploidy (>50 chromosomes) 53, low hyperdiploidy (47\u201350 chromosomes) 52, hypodiploidy (45\u201339 chromosomes) 32 and extreme hypodiploidy (<39 chromosomes) 2. Twenty-eight patients (8.3% of the 338 evaluable karyotypes) had CK and 54 (11.2% of the 481 evaluable karyotypes) had MK. The CR rate, probability of CR duration, the OS probability and the EFS probability are described in table 1 . In our study the CK and the MK did not have any impact on CR, CR duration, OS and EFS. Analysis of OS probabilities at 4 years of the most important cytogenetic abnormalities showed: normal karyotype: 46\u00b15%, t(9;22): 20\u00b112%, t(v;11q23): 26\u00b117%, hyperdiplody: 54\u00b115%, hypodiploidy: 47\u00b127%, t(1;19): 44\u00b131% and t(8;14)/t(8;22)/t(2;8): 48\u00b116% (p<0.001).

Patients with t(9;22) and t(v;11q23) had the worst prognosis and the t(1;19) did not have prognostic significance. The introduction of imatinib in patients with t(9:22) ALL significantly improved their outcome. The CK and the MK were not associated with a worse prognosis in patients treated with risk-adapted or subtype-oriented protocols of the PETHEMA group.
