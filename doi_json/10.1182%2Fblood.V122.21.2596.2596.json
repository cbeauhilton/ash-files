    "abstract_text": "Isochromosome 17q [i(17q)], a poor prognostic cytogenetic abnormality is a product of the breakage or inappropriate division of the pericentromere leading to the duplication of the long and loss of the short arm of chromosome 17. The region of the breakpoints maps at 17p11, a region encompassing a key tumor suppressor gene: TP53 . I(17q) are detected in myelodysplastic/ myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/ MPN), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This abnormality can occur as a sole structural abnormality or in combination with other chromosomal defects. The presence of i(17q) is associated with poor therapeutic response, disease progression, and an unfavorable clinical outcome. Elucidation of the molecular architecture of patients (pts) carrying i(17q) may lead to better understanding of disease biology and development of novel compounds that can target this disease. We selected 11 pts with i(17q) to characterize their genomic differences. We applied whole exome sequencing (WES) in order to define latent molecular defects explaining the clinical phenotype of this disease. The index case was a male MDS/MPN pt with isolated i(17q), 27% RS, hypercellular bone marrow (BM), mild splenomegaly, and atypical megakaryocytes. The pt developed 7% BM blasts without clinical response to growth factors. Molecularly this pt was a wild type SF3B1 , a gene frequently mutated in RARS-T and associated with lower transformation rate to leukemia, better survival, and good/intermediate risk cytogenetic abnormalities. WES was performed on 2 ug of total DNA extracted from BM cells. Non-clonal CD3+ cells were used as source of germ-line control. Twenty-millions reads were run on an Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer. Using a stringent bio-informatic algorithm developed in house, all variants were filtered based on a variation score (>=30) and a coverage (30X) and the tumor nucleotide variation analysis was performed for each pair (tumor vs. germ-line), where only the variants unique to the tumor were retained. Variants were ultimately filtered in order to exclude SNPs by an in-house annotation and importing the hg19 SNP135. We detected 65 unique candidate genes. Four genes were confirmed to be somatic: 3 were novel: ZFP42 (4q35.2), P4HTM (3p21.31), and VPRBP (3p21.2) and 1 includes the newly discovered SETBP1 (18q12.3) gene. Three variants detected on the chromosome 17 had a wild type configuration. The subsequently genotyped all the pts (MDS/MPN/-U 3; AML 4; RCMD 1; CML 1; RAEB-1 2; mean age: 68 years; male/female: 8/3; i(17q)/other abnormalities:3/8) for the above genes and for a panel of genes known to be mutated in MDS/MPN and other diseases in order to find any genetic association explaining the disase phenotype. We applied Sanger sequencing to DNA derived from BM/peripheral blood cells (BM/PB:7/4) for the following genes and respective exons: TP53 (all exons), SF3B1 (13-16), SRSF2 (1-2), U2AF1 (2 and 6), TET2 (all exons), DNMT3A (18-23), IDH1/2 (4), CBL (8-9), N/KRAS (1-2), ASXL1 (12), JAK2 (12 and 14), EZH2 (16, 18 and 19), MPL (exon 10), BCAS3 (12, 15 and 16), FLT3 (11 and 17), and CSF3R (13,14, and 17). In total, we found 16 heterozygous missense mutations and 1 tandem duplication. We found somatic mutations in ZFP42 , P4HTM , and VPRBP in 1 pt. The index case reported a mutation in SETBP1 and SRSF2 . SF3B1 was detected as a sole abnormality in 1 patient. Of note, the patient with SF3B1 mutation (K700E) had 50% RS and achieved a complete hematologic remission after decitabine therapy. The most frequent mutations were found in SETBP1 and SRSF2 . SETBP1 was found to be mutated in 4/11 (36.3%) pts (D868N, I871T, and G870S was common in 2 pts) while SRSF2 mutations (P95H/R) were found in 3/11 (27.2%) pts. Three pts showed concomitant SRSF2 and SETBP1 mutations. NRAS (G12D) was mutated in 1 pt and associated with SRSF2 and SETBP1 mutations. One pt showed mutations in TET2 , JAK2 , and TP53 . Of note, this pt did not respond to treatment. One pt with MDS/MPN showed a mutation in CSF3R (Q741X), a novel gene discovered in chronic neutrophilic leukemia and atypical CML. The pt also has monosomy 7 and i(17q) abnormality. FLT3-ITD was found in 1 pt. As of last follow-up, only 2 pts remain alive. In sum, we found that poor risk molecular mutations in SRSF2 and SETBP1 are frequently found in i(17q) myeloid malignancies and may be the drivers of poor outcomes in this disease.
