    "abstract_text": "Although anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (HL) are distinctive disease entities, there is a considerable overlap in morphological and immunophenotypical features between the two lymphoma subtypes. We performed a supervised clustering analysis comparing gene expression profiles of ALCL/HL cell lines with those of a variety of B-cell tumor cell lines. The result showed that the genes, expressions of which in the ALCL/HL cluster were lower than those in B-cell tumors, included a set of genes for protein tyrosine kinases. It is suggested that in ALCL/HL, genes encoding for signal transduction molecules downstream of T- and B- cell receptor are down-regulated, even though both diseases are of lymphoid cell origin. On the other hand, we found a total of 21 genes whose expressions were shared with ALCL and HL, including JUN , ems 1 oncogene ( EMS1 ), cyclin-dependent kinase 6 ( CDK6 ), and integrin alpha 4 ( ITGA4 ). We next performed a second supervised clustering to effectively separate ALCL and HL. Of 87 genes differentially expressed between ALCL and HL, 54 genes were expressed to a higher degree in ALCL than HL, whereas expression levels of 33 genes were higher in HL than ALCL. The ALCL-associated genes included cdk inhibitors, p19 INK4d and p21 WAF1/CIP1 , suggesting that genes involved in cell cycle-regulating pathways are differentially expressed between ALCL and HL. Our study provided potentially interesting molecules that can account for the similarity and difference of ALCL and HL.",
