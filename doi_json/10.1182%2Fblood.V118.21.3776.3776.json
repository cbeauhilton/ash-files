    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3776 Cumulative evidence suggests that dormant self-renewing leukemia stem cells (LSC) contribute to relapse and blast crisis transformation by evading therapies that target cycling cells. Previously, sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling was shown to modulate cell cycle regulation and self-renewal in normal mouse hematopoietic stem cells. However, its role in human LSC regeneration and quiescence had not been elucidated. Here we investigated the role of Shh signaling in maintenance of dormancy. We show that, compared to chronic phase CML and normal progenitors, human blast crisis LSC harbor enhanced expression of the Shh transcriptional activator, GLI2, and decreased expression of a transcriptional repressor, GLI3. Treatment of human blast crisis LSC engrafted RAG2 \u2212/\u2212 gc \u2212/\u2212 mice with a selective Shh inhibitor, PF-04449913, reduced leukemic burden in a niche-dependent manner commensurate with GLI downregulation. Full transcriptome RNA sequencing performed on FACS-purified human progenitors from PF-04449913 treated blast crisis LSC engrafted mice demonstrated greater Shh gene splice isoform concordance with normal progenitors than vehicle treated controls. In addition, RNA sequencing revealed significantly decreased cell cycle regulatory genes expression and splice isoform analysis demonstrated reversion towards a normal splice isoform signature for many cell cycle regulatory genes. Moreover, cell cycle FACS analysis showed that selective Shh inhibition permitted dormant blast crisis LSC to enter the cell cycle while normal progenitor cell cycle status was unaffected. Finally, PF-04449913 synergized with BCR-ABL inhibition to reduce blast crisis LSC survival and self-renewal in concert with increased expression of Shh pathway regulators. Our findings suggest that selective Shh antagonism induces cycling of dormant human blast crisis LSC, rendering them susceptible to BCR-ABL inhibition, while sparing normal progenitors. Implementation of novel LSC splice isoform detection platforms to assess efficacy of Shh inhibitor-mediated sensitization to molecularly targeted therapy may inform dormant cancer stem cell elimination strategies that ultimately avert relapse.
