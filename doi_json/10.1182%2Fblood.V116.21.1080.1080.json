    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1080 Background: The role of arsenic trioxide (ATO) in the frontline treatment of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) remains unclear with a number of studies reporting high and durable responses with single agent ATO. We have conducted a trial combining all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) with ATO with or without gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) in patients with previously untreated APL. Patients and methods: From July 2002 to June 2010, 104 patients with newly diagnosed APL were treated with a combination of ATRA plus ATO in two studies. The first cohort of 47 patients received ATRA (45 mg/m 2 daily) and ATO (0.15 mg/kg daily beginning on day 10 of ATRA). High-risk patients (White blood cell count [WBC] > 10 \u00d7 10 9 /L) received GO 9 mg/m 2 on the first day of induction. From July 2007, the second cohort of 57 patients received ATRA (45 mg/m 2 daily) and ATO (0.15 mg/kg daily) concomitantly on day one of induction. They also received GO 9 mg/m 2 on day 1, if high risk, and any time during induction if the WBC rose to > 30 \u00d7 10 9 /L (and more recently if > 10 \u00d7 10 9 /L). Monitoring for PML-RARA fusion gene using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted after induction and throughout consolidation and follow up. The median age for the 104 patients was 46 years (range, 14\u201381). Their median presenting WBC was 2.7 \u00d7 10 9 /L (0.4-131.4 \u00d7 10 9 /L) and their median platelet count was 36 \u00d7 10 9 /L (range, 7\u2013261 \u00d7 10 9 /L). Seventy three (70%) had low risk and 31 (30%) high risk disease (based only on the presentation WBC \u2264 or > 10.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L). Results: Overall, 102 patients (98%) achieved complete remission (CR) and 2 died during induction. With a median follow-up of 115 weeks (range, 4 to 397 weeks), 94 patients remain alive. The estimated 5-year survival rate was 88% and event-free survival 86%; only 5 of the patients achieving a CR (5%) have relapsed. The median overall survival, remission duration and event-free survival have not been reached ( Figure ). Thirty six patients have been alive and in remission for more than 3 years and 21 for more than 5 years. Two late deaths (beyond 300 weeks) occurred in CR from unrelated causes. Conclusion: The combination of ATRA and ATO (with or without GO) as initial therapy for APL is highly effective and safe; it can potentially substitute for chemotherapy containing regimens in high and low risk patients.
