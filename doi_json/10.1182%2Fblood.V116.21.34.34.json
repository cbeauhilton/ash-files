    "abstract_text": "Abstract 34 We performed randomized phase III study to compare the regimen related toxicities (RRT) of two different conditioning regimens, cyclophosphamide (CyATG) vs. cyclophosphamide plus fludarabine (CyFluATG) given in addition to anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHSCT) for bone marrow failure syndrome including severe aplastic anemia (AA) and hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). CyATG consisted of Cyclophosphamide (Cy) 50 mg/kg (D \u20135 to \u20132). CyFluATG arm received fludarabine (Flu) 30 mg/m2 (D \u20136 to \u20132) and Cy 50 mg/kg (D \u20133 to \u20132). Thymoglobuline 3 mg/kg, lymphoglobulin 15 mg/kg on days -4 to -2 or alemtuzumab 20mg on day -4 were infused in both arms. Patients were stratified by stem cell donor (related vs. unrelated). Total 83 patients (40 patients to Cy-ATG and 43 patients to Cy-Flu-ATG) were enrolled from February 2003. All patients except for one patient, who had assigned to Cy-Flu-ATG arm and died during conditioning, received full planed regimen and all planned patients were included in this analysis. Median age was 34 (15-60) years and male patients were 42/83 (50.6%). AA patients were 79 and MDS were 4. Matched sibling donors were 53 (63.9%). ATG was used in form of thymoglobulin (n=75, 90.4%), and some patients had received ALG (n=5, 6.0%) or alemtuzumab (n=3, 3.6%). Median duration from diagnosis to transplantation was 4.7 (0.2-177.7) months. Age, gender, donor type were not different in both arms ( Table 1 ). Various TRT were similar between Cy-ATG and Cy-Flu-ATG ( Table 2 ); granulocyte graft failure rate (p=0.959), platelet graft failure rate (p=0.625), acute GvHD (p=0.388), chronic GvHD (p=0.991), CMV antigenemia (p=0.550), hematuria (p=0.480). However, pulmonary complications (p=0.005) was significantly lower in CyFluATG arm. Infection rate (p=0.130) and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS, p=0.101) seemed lower in CyFluATG arm but were not statistically significant. Any RRTs were significantly higher in CyATG arm (80.0% vs. 39.5%; p<0.001) but any treatment-related toxicities were similar in both arms (85% vs. 79.1%; p=0.483). Figure 1 shows that 4-year survival rates (77.7% vs. 87.6%) were higher in CyFluATG arm without any statistical significance (p=0.265) and this trend was similar in MRD (81.9 vs. 92.1%; p=0.354) and AD (69.3 vs. 80.2%; p=0.442). In conclusion, overall treatment-related complications and survival were similar between CyATG CyFluATG, however, CyFluATG seemed superior over CyATG in terms of pulmonary complications and RRT.
