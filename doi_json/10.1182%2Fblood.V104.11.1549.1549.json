    "abstract_text": "The interaction of platelets with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Previously, we have shown that native LDL (nLDL) is a mild activator of platelets increasing their sensitivity to aggregation-inducing agents. Binding of nLDL to platelets was saturable, reversible and initiated signal transduction to p38 MAPK suggesting the involvement of a receptor. A peptide mimic of the B-site in apoB100 resembled nLDL in its platelet-activating properties, suggesting that the receptor is a member of the LDL-receptor family. Platelets from familial hypercholesterolemia patients, who lack or have a defective apoB/E receptor, responded normally to nLDL and an antibody against this receptor left nLDL-induced activation of normal platelets undisturbed, excluding the involvement of the classical LDL (apoB/E)-receptor. In this study, we provide evidence that nLDL initiates platelet signaling to p38 MAPK via a splice variant of the LDL-receptor family member Apolipoprotein E Receptor 2 (ApoER2\u2032). This conclusion is based on (i) blockade of nLDL-induced p38 MAPK activation by receptor-associated protein (RAP), an inhibitor of ligand binding to members of the LDL-receptor family, (ii) confocal microscopy showing a high degree of co-localization of nLDL and ApoER2\u2032 at the platelet surface, (iii) binding of both nLDL and the B-site peptide to soluble ApoER2\u2032, (iv) activation of p38 MAPK by an anti-ApoER2 antibody with similar kinetics as nLDL, and (v) tyrosine phosphorylation of ApoER2\u2032 upon binding of nLDL. The nLDL-induced phosphorylation of ApoER2\u2032 could be abolished by PP1, an inhibitor of Src-like tyrosine kinases. In the absence of PP1, ApoER2\u2032 phosphorylation was accompanied by co-association with the Src-family member Fgr. We conclude that binding of nLDL to platelets involves ApoER2\u2032. Upon nLDL binding, the receptor is phosphorylated which induces the recruitment of Fgr, a kinase known to activate p38 MAPK . The ApoER2\u2032-Fgr complex subsequently activates p38 MAPK , an upstream element in the formation of thromboxane A 2 that primes the platelets to further stimulation by aggregation-inducing agents.",
