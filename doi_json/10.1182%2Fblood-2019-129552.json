    "abstract_text": "Background : Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is a heterogeneous group comprising about 10-15% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas in Western populations. Only a minority (~30%) of patients with the most common PTCL subtypes achieve a durable remission and long-term survival. Data on the clinical features of PTCL in a Chinese population are limited. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 342 patients with pathologically diagnosed T cell lymphoma at Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital from June 2007 through March 2019. We evaluated the incidence of PTCL subtypes, clinical characteristics and survival status. Results: Of the 342 patients, 17.3% (n=59) had PTCL-not otherwise specified(NOS), 9.4% (n=32) had angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma(AITL), 19.6% (n=67) had anaplastic large cell lymphoma(ALCL) (anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive ALCL:12.0%, n=41; anaplastic lymphoma kinase negative ALCL: 9.6%, n=26), 36.2%(N=124) had NK/T cell lymphoma, 12.9% (n=44)had lymphoblastic lymphoma(LBL), and 4.6%(n=16) had other subtypes. For next data analysis, NK/T cell lymphoma and LBL were excluded. Finally, a total of 164 patients with integrally follow-up information were analyzed. The median age was 49.5 years (range 15-87) old and the median follow-up time was 15.8 months (range 0.5-124.3). Most patients were males (62.0%) with advanced stage disease (III/IV, 74.5%), and 51.0% of patients presented with B symptoms and 83.0% with no bulky disease. For the total population, the median progression-free survival(PFS) and overall survival(OS) was 6.5 months and 13.5 months, respectively. ALCL patients had better PFS and OS than PTCL-NOS and AITL (PFS: 51.2 vs. 5.8 vs.4.7 months, P = 0. 000; OS: not reached vs. 13.4 vs. 8.8 months, P = 0.000). There were no difference of PFS and OS between PTCL-NOS and AITL( P = 0. 550 and P = 0. 333, respectively). Conclusions: ALCL has better outcome than other PTCL subtypes. However, no efficacy therapy has emerged for patients with relapsed/refractory PTCL and outcomes in this setting are still poor. Novel potential targets for PTCL, with particular focus on identifying markers of response and resistance need further investigation. Disclosures Li: Guangdong Province Hospital: Employment."
