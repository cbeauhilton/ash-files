    "abstract_text": "A gain-of-function mutation of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene has been recently reported in patients with polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF) [N Engl J Med. 2005 Apr 28;352(17):1779\u201390]. Abnormal trafficking of CD34-positive cells with increased numbers in the peripheral blood is found in CIMF and in advanced stages of other myeloproliferative disorders. To determine whether the unique JAK2 V617F mutation affects the mobilization of CD34-positive cells into peripheral blood, we studied the relationship between JAK2 mutation status, bone marrow and circulating CD34-positive cells in 72 patients diagnosed according to the WHO criteria. A quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based allelic discrimination assay was used for the quantitative detection of the JAK2 V617F alleles in circulating granulocytes. Bone marrow CD34-positive cells were quantitatively assed on paraffin immunostained sections, while circulating CD34-positive cells were enumerated by flow cytometry using a single-platform assay. Overall, 57% of the patients studied carried the JAK2 V617F mutation. Within these patients, median values for JAK2 V617F alleles in circulating granulocytes were as follows: 29% in PV, 4% in ET, 12% in prefibrotic CIMF, 27% in fibrotic CIMF, and 99% in post-PV myelofibrosis. The vast majority of circulating granulocytes were homozygous for the mutation in all but one of patients with post-PV myelofibrosis. Decreased numbers of bone marrow CD34-positive cells and increased counts of circulating CD34-positive cells were detected in patients with fibrotic bone marrow. The higher the degree of fibrosis, the higher the circulating CD34-positive cell count (P<0.001) and the lower the bone marrow CD34-positive cell count (P<0.01). All patients with PV, ET and prefibrotic CIMF, and 7 out of 21 patients with fibrotic CIMF had circulating CD34-positive cell counts lower than 10 x 10 6 /L. Conversely, all patients with post-PV myelofibrosis had counts higher than 10 x 10 6 /L. In univariate analysis, there was an inverse relationship between percentage of JAK2 V617F alleles and bone marrow CD34-positive cells (r=\u22120.35, P<0.01), and a direct relationship between percentage of JAK2 mutant alleles and circulating CD34-positive cells (r=0.46, P=0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that disease category (P=0.0008) and percentage of JAK2 V617F alleles (P=0.03) were independently related to circulating CD34-positive cell counts. These observations suggest that the JAK2 V617F mutation might be involved in the constitutive mobilization of CD34-positive cells into peripheral blood that is found in patients with myeloproliferative disorder. Nonetheless, constitutive mobilization is present in a considerable portion of patients who do not carry the JAK2 mutation, pointing to additional pathogenetic mechanisms. Findings on patients with PV suggest that transition form heterozygosity to homozygosity for JAK2 V617F may represent an important step in the progression of PV to myelofibrosis. Thus, sequential evaluation of the percentage of JAK2 mutant alleles and enumeration of circulating CD34-positive cells may be useful for disease monitoring in PV.",
