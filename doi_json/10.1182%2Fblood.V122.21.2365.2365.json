    "abstract_text": "von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a large multimeric glycoprotein secreted from platelet \u03b1-granules and Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells. VWF mediates the initial adhesion of platelets at sites of vascular injury and binds to and stabilizes blood coagulation factor VIII in the circulation to protect it from inactivation and clearance. von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common hereditary bleeding disorder and results from the deficiency or dysfunction of VWF leading to mucocutaneous bleeding, including epistaxis, menorrhagia, and excessive bleeding after trauma or surgery. Bleeding in patients with VWD is treated with infusion of plasma-derived VWF containing FVIII concentrates or 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP, desmopression). DDAVP is an analog of vasopressin antidiuretic hormone which can stimulate the exocytosis of VWF from storage sites and increase VWF and FVIII levels. DDAVP can be administrated by intravenous and intranasal routes. There are several reports of the safety and efficacy of intravenous DDAVP, but few with concentrated intranasal DDAVP (Stimate\u00ae). Here we report on the efficacy and safety of Stimate\u00ae in patients with VWD Methods Hospital records for 72 patients with VWD who received Stimate\u00ae from 1998 to 2012 were reviewed. The primary endpoint was the patients\u2019 biological response to Stimate\u00ae, defined as at least a 3 fold increase compared to baseline of both ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:RCo), factor VIII procoagulant activity (FVIII:C), or both VWF:RCo and FVIII:C are over 100% after Stimate\u00ae. Individuals not meeting the response criteria were deemed to be nonresponse. The adverse events were analyzed between different VWD types, response, age, gender, and race. Result Of those 72 VWD patients, 45 have type 1 (62%), 7 have type 2 (10%), and in 20 cases the subtype was unclear (28%). Responsive to Stimate\u00ae was observed in 43 (95.6%) of type 1, 4 (57.1%) of type 2, and 19 (95%) in which the diagnosis was unclear. In total, 16 patients (22.2%) had adverse events: 1 \u2013 allegoric response, 8 - mild headache, 4 - mild hyponatremia, and 4 - blood pressure (BP) reduced more than 20 mmHg. Conclusion Patients with VWD 1 have higher response rates to Stimate\u00ae than patients with VWD 2 in our test. The Stimate\u00ae is effective and safe for treatment of VWD.
