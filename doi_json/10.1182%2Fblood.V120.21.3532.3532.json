    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3532 B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) arises by transformation of progenitor (pre-B) cells. Cure rates in adults remain low and treatment is complicated by microenvironment-mediated resistance to cytotoxic drugs, indicating an urgent need for development of new, more targeted treatment approaches. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), a B cell receptor (BCR)-associated tyrosine kinase, recently was identified as a novel therapeutic target in mature B cell malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Besides its role in BCR signaling in mature B cells, Syk also plays an important role in maintenance and expansion of immature B cells. Syk-deficient mice display a severe defect of B lymphopoiesis, with a block at the pro-B to pre-B transition, consistent with a key role for Syk in pre-BCR signaling. We therefore hypothesized that pre-B ALL cells which express pre-BCRs might be more sensitive to Syk inhibition than other ALL subtypes, which either do not have functional pre-BCRs (pro-B ALL) or display modifying genetic lesions (Ph + /BCR-ABL + B-ALL). PRT060318, a highly specific, ATP-competitive, small molecular inhibitor of Syk, has preclinical activity in CLL and DLBCL models (Hoellenriegel J et al., Leukemia 26:1576\u201383, 2012). Syk specificity was confirmed by cellular and non-cellular kinase inhibition assays. We performed metabolic assays using the tetrazolium dye XTT to screen B-ALL cell lines (RS4;11, REH, TOM-1, Nalm-20, Nalm-21, Nalm-6, 697, Kasumi-2, KOPN-8, RCH-ACV, SMS-SB) for responses to PRT060318. ALL cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of PRT060318 (100 nM \u2013 10 \u03bcM) for 72 hours. Based on the XTT assays, we determined half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ), and separated B-ALL cells into responsive (IC 50 < 4.5 \u03bcM) and non-responsive (IC 50 > 4.5 \u03bcM) groups. Interestingly, the responsive group consisted only of pre-B ALL cells (CD10 + , TdT + , cytoIg\u03bc + ), whereas the resistant group comprised only ALL cell lines with a pro-B cell phenotype (CD10+/\u2212, TdT+, cytoIg\u03bc-). All BCR-ABL positive cell lines tested exhibit the pro-B cell phenotype and, similar to their BCR-ABL negative counterparts, were resistant to PRT060318. The Figure depicts XTT assay results for two PRT060318-sensitive pre-B (grey lines) and two resistant pro-B (black lines) B-ALL cell lines. Western Blot analysis demonstrated SYK protein expression in all B-ALL cell lines, excluding lack of target protein expression as possible cause for different response rates between pre-B and pro-B ALL cells. Cell proliferation assays revealed a significant, dose-dependent inhibition of pre-B ALL cell proliferation by PRT060318. Concordantly, dose depended S phase reduction was detected in all PRT060318-sensitive cell lines. In apoptosis assays, in which sensitive pre-B ALL lines were incubated with increasing concentrations of PRT060318 (up to 5 \u03bcM) we did not find any significant induction of apoptosis, suggesting anti-proliferative, rather than cytotoxic effects as a main mechanism of action of PRT060318. Preliminary data of primary ALL patient samples, cultured with KUSA-H1 marrow stroma cells in the presence or absence of PRT060318 demonstrate induction of apoptosis in 3 out of 10 samples, other assays are ongoing. In conclusion, we provide evidence that the Syk inhibitor PRT060318 thwarts pre-B ALL cell proliferation, providing a first rationale for clinical testing of PRT060318 in selected patients with B cell ALL.
