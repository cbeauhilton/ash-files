    "abstract_text": "Gain-of-function mutations of erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) resulting from truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of EPOR are associated with primary familial and congenital polycythemia (PFCP). We generated and previously reported a PFCP mouse model where the murine EpoR gene (m EpoR ) was replaced with wild-type human EPOR (wtH EPOR ) or mutant human EPOR (mtH EPOR ) genes. We showed that mtH EPOR mice become polycythemic at 3-6 weeks of age, but not at birth, similar to the polycythemia phenotype of affected humans, while the wtH EPOR mice were anemic (Divoky et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2001;98:986). In addition, we previously reported (Yoon et al, ASH Annual Meeting Abstracts 2005 106: Abstract 567) that mtH EPOR fetuses are polycythemic at the mid- and late-gestation stages (embryonic days, E12.4-18.5), while wtH EPOR fetuses are anemic, similar to what we observed in adult mice. The mtH EPOR fetal liver cells (FLCs) revealed augmented and sustained activation of Stat5, while wtH EPOR FLCs had significantly reduced Stat5 activation. We also previously presented (Yoon and Prchal, ASH Annual Meeting Abstracts 2007 110: Abstract 3664) that the fetal polycythemia of mtH EPOR mice is associated with a delayed switch from primitive to definitive erythropoiesis, and that polycythemia in mtH EPOR mice is transiently corrected in perinatal life and reappears at 3 weeks after birth. Here, we hypothesized that the change of oxygen tension at delivery (from the uterus to ambient atmosphere) and differences in Epo levels may account for the inexplicable perinatal absence of polycythemia in mtH EPOR mice. Epo levels in adult mice were substantially elevated in wtH EPOR (1271\u00b1240 pg/mL) and significantly reduced in mtH EPOR (98\u00b151 pg/mL) when compared to m EpoR mice (265\u00b162 pg/mL). We then proposed that destruction of young red blood cells (RBCs), termed neocytolysis (a mechanism that overcorrects increased RBC mass generated during chronic hypoxemia after restoration of normoxic conditions) contributes to the anemia of newborns (Song et al, J Mol Med 2015;93:857). When adult mice were challenged by rapid conversion from 10 days of hypoxia (12% of O 2 ) to normoxia, the mtH EPOR mice had greater changes of hematocrit (drop of 16.9%) than other genotypes (drop of 14.8% for m EpoR and13.8% for wtH EPOR ). Similarly, the most pronounced decrease of hematocrit after birth, at perinatal day 7, (PN7) was detected in mtH EPOR mice (drop of 56%) followed by m EpoR (drop of 48%) and only a relatively moderate decrease of hematocrit in wtH EPOR neonates (drop of 24%). In parallel, PN7 mtH EPOR newborns had the lowest levels of Epo (310\u00b1102 pg/mL), while PN7 wtH EPOR neonates had Epo levels markedly increased (2757\u00b1912 pg/mL); the Epo levels of control m EpoR at PN7 littermates were 494\u00b1102 pg/mL. This suggests that Epo protects from neocytolysis. These changes corresponded to exposure of phosphatidylserine; a stimulus for RBC removal from circulation. There was a gradual increase of phosphatidylserine-positive RBCs in mtH EPOR neonates and, to a lower extent, also in m EpoR between PN0 and PN7 with a maximum positivity at PN7 (mean fluorescence: 6.5\u00b12.8 and 6.2\u00b11.7 for mtH EPOR and m EpoR , respectively). This correlated with a maximal decrease of hematocrit and lowest Epo levels at PN7 in mtH EPOR . The proportion of phosphatidylserine-positive RBCs then declined with age (mean fluorescence of 0.6 in adult mtH EPOR mice). In contrast, wtH EPOR mice had the lowest numbers of phosphatidylserine-positive RBCs, which were comparable at all analyzed time-points (mean fluorescence at PN0=0.7\u00b10.1; PN7=1.3\u00b10.3; in adults=0.6\u00b10.04), consistent with the lowest reduction in perinatal hematocrit and very high Epo levels in these mice. In conclusion, our study describes that transient correction of polycythemia of the mt HEPOR PFCP mouse model in the perinatal period is associated with low Epo levels and increased erythrocyte phosphatidylserine exposure. Increased phosphatidylserine exposure on the membrane of mtH EPOR RBCs is consistent with accelerated destruction of these cells by macrophages, thus contributing to the decrease of hematocrit in mt HEPOR neonatal mice.
