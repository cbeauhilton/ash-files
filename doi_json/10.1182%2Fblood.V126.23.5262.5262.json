    "abstract_text": "Background: The use of azatidine (AZT) is the agent of choice for first line treatment of elderly (age >74 years) patients (pts) with high risk MDS or AML (2015 National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines). The Hematology consultant is frequently involved in the care of very elderly (age >79 years) individuals. Our aim is to report our experience with 3 patient aged 80 or above that received treatment with AZT. Methods: Retrospective review Results: We reviewed the medical records of patients treated for high risk MDS or AML at our institution between July 2009 and March 2012. A total of 3 pts aged 80 or above were identified. All three pts were males, and all received AZT 100 mg/m2/day x 7 days subcutaneously in every cycle of 28 days. Patient 1 (aged 81) had 12 % of blasts in the bone marrow (BM), was diagnosed with Refractory Anemia with Excess Blasts-2 (RAEB-2) applying the 2008 World Health Organization Classification (WHO) of MDS. Patient 2 (aged 90) had AML with multilineage dysplasia and 38% blasts in BM. Patient 3 (aged 80) had AML with multilineage dysplasia and 30% blasts in BM. Pts characteristics and results are summarized in Table 1. Conclusions: In pts diagnosed with high risk MDS or AML, advanced chronological age (> 79 years) alone should not preclude the use of effective and well tolerated therapy. Identification of pts in this geriatric subgroup who may benefit from AZT merits additional research. Table 1.  . Diagnosis . Age(years) .
