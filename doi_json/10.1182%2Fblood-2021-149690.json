    "abstract_text": "The importance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) dose in the outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has been demonstrated by analyses of the threshold dose of CD34+ cells required to achieve donor engraftment, usually defined as endpoints of donor-derived neutrophil (PMN) or platelet (PLT) absolute numbers, and RBC transfusion independence. We recently described the heterogeneous HSPC composition of prospectively obtained umbilical cord blood samples and lack of correlation between CD34+ cell dose and the frequency of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC)(Mantri S et al, Blood Adv 2020). We describe here a pilot analysis of the relationship between HSPC graft composition and engraftment after HSCT. The study population is comprised of 17 children (3.4-22 years, median 13 years) treated with \u03b1\u03b2T/CD19B - cell depleted mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) HSCT (\u03b1\u03b2haplo-HSCT). Eight patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, seven had acute myeloid leukemia, and two myelodysplastic syndrome. All patients received serotherapy with Thymoglobulin and Rituximab, and a myeloablative conditioning consisting of either TBI 1200 cGy in combination with Fludarabine/Thiotepa (15 patients), Melphalan/Thiotepa (1 patient), or TBI (400 cGy) with Fludarabine/Thiotepa (1 patient receiving a second HSCT). Only 2/17 patients received 1-2 doses of G-CSF before Day+30. The CD34+ Lin- cells in the PBSC products were analyzed for HSPC composition, including HSC (CD38- CD90+ CD45RA-), Multipotent Progenitors (MPP, CD38- CD90- CD45RA-), Common Myeloid Progenitors (CMP, CD38+ CD123+ CD45RA-), Granulocyte-Monocyte Progenitors (GMP, CD38+ CD123+ CD45RA+), Megakaryocyte-Erythroid Progenitors (MEP, CD38+ CD123- CD45RA-) and Common Lymphoid Progenitors (CLP, CD38+ CD127+). Similar HSPC analyses were performed on marrow obtained at Days +30, +60, and +90 post-HSCT. The CD34+ cell dose in the grafts ranged from 8.5-40 x 10e6/kg recipient body weight (mean 15.6). The median time to Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) > 500 or 1000/mm 3 were Days +12 and +14, respectively, and for PLT > 50K or 100K/mm 3 Days +14 and +15, respectively. The time to either PMN or PLT engraftment did not correlate with the HSC dose. In contrast, the GMP dose was predictive of PMN engraftment: 7/8 patients receiving the highest GMP dose achieved ANC > 500 at 0-3 days before the median day of engraftment, while PMN engraftment was delayed by 1-5 days beyond the median in 6 of the 9 receiving the lowest GMP dose (\u03c7 2 = 8.14, p=0.004)(Fig A). Of the patients with the highest MEP dose, 7/8 achieved PLT >50K/mm 3 0-4 days before the median, while 5/9 receiving the lowest dose engrafted 1-6 days beyond the median (\u03c7 2 4.9, p=0.026) (Fig B). In the first 100 days post-HSCT, na\u00efve CD4+ T-cells were all CD31+ CD45RA+ Recent Thymic Emigrants (RTE), indicating that they were newly produced T cells and not adoptively transferred from the \u03b1\u03b2haplo-HSCT. The HSC dose did not correlate with the number of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells until Day+180 (Fig C). Like PMN and PLT recovery, early T lymphoid recovery after HSCT was mainly derived from infused CLP, and likely switched to HSC-derived lymphopoiesis by Day +180. Consistent with this concept, HSC dose in the PBSC products was unrelated to the numbers of committed progenitors, e.g., CMP, MEP, CLP, in early (Day +30) post-transplant marrow samples. These data are consistent with clonal analyses of patients receiving lentiviral gene therapy and murine experiments demonstrating prolonged steady-state contribution of committed progenitors to peripheral blood cell maintenance (Biasco L et al, Cell Stem Cell 2016; Sun J et al, Nature 2014). While post-HSCT PMN or PLT numbers are frequently equated with \"HSC engraftment\" and na\u00efve T-cell numbers with HSC-derived immune reconstitution, these early events reflect blood cell production by committed progenitors, which are variably present in the grafts. Although CD34+ cell dose is currently used to predict post-transplant engraftment and to qualify stem cell products for release, more accurate clinical predictions may be determined by the HSPC grafts' composition. Further, engineering of the progenitor composition of clinical HSCT products, e.g., co-transplantation of additional committed progenitors like GMP or CLP, could be strategically used to control post-transplant lymphohematopoietic recovery.
