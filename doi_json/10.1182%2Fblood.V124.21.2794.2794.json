    "abstract_text": "I ntroduction We present a case of TTP refractory to usual therapies treated successfully with eculizumab. Case presentation A 64 year-old African American female with history of diabetes and hypertension presented with left sided weakness and seizure-like activity preceded by 2 days of headaches and 2 weeks of easy bruising. On admission her vital signs and physical exam were unremarkable. Her basic metabolic panel, ANA panel, hepatitis panel, HIV, and anti-phospholipid panel was negative. Her hemoglobin was 9.0 g/dL, platelets were 13K/uL, LDH was 954IU/L , haptoglobin 100% and there is no inhibitor. Discussion TTP and aHUS are both thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA). TTP is caused by acquired or inherited deficiency of the ADAMTS 13 protein or due the formation of an inhibitor to the ADAMTS13 protein. aHUS results, in most cases, from a genetic mutation in complement factor H in the alternative pathway of the complement cascade. Recent studies have described the importance of the complement system in all forms of TMA (Update on the role of the complement system in the pathogenesis of thrombotic microangiopathies. Prilozi. 2014;35(1):115-22). While plasma exchange is the cornerstone of TTP treatment, complement inhibition with drugs such as eculizumab is the treatment of choice for aHUS. The use of complement inhibiting drugs has not yet been studied in TTP. We report an unusual case of TTP, with confirmed ADAMTS 13 inhibitor and low activity, which did not respond to conventional treatment for TTP. Theorizing that this patient either had concurrent aHUS or had TTP with a dysregulated alternate complement pathway, we used eculizumab, to which the patient had a remarkable and persistent response. There are other reports in literature of patients with aHUS having reduced levels of ADAMTS13 protein; however, these patients did not have an inhibitor as was seen in our patient (Partial ADAMTS13 deficiency in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. Blood. 2013 Aug 22;122(8):1487-93). There is one other case in the literature where TTP was treated successfully with eculizumab. In that case, discontinuation of eculizumab was associated with a relapse of TTP and so had to be continued (Eculizumab in the treatment of refractory idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Br J Haematology. 2012 June;157 (6):772-4). To our knowledge, we report the first case of a confirmed diagnosis of TTP treated successfully with eculizumab with remission continuing 3 months after discontinuation of the drug. The use of eculizumab and the role of the complement pathway in TTP deserves further study.
