    "abstract_text": "AIMS Computerised Tomography (CT) scanning is the primary modality for assessment of therapeutic response in DLBCL. We evaluated whether functional imaging utilising FDG-PET may provide additional prognostic information in response assessment prior to completion of chemotherapy for patients with DLBCL. METHODS We performed a retrospective, single-centre study of patients with DLBCL who received anthracycline-based chemotherapy +/\u2212 radiotherapy (RT) and had PET prior to completion of therapy. RESULTS From 1996\u20132004 there were 45 eligible patients. Median age was 59 years (range 26\u201382) with disease stage I\u2013II (n=25) or III\u2013IV (n=20). Median IPI was 2[IPI 0\u20132(n=27), IPI 3\u20134(n=13)] in 40 evaluable patients. Therapy included full-course CHOP/CHOP-like therapy (n=26); HyperCVAD (n=6) and limited (3\u20134 cycles) CHOP/CHOP-like chemotherapy with RT (n=13). Rituximab was used concurrently in 18 patients. Planned RT was administered in 23 patients. 13 (29%) patients were PET positive after a median of 3 chemotherapy cycles (range 1\u20135). Of these, 7 (54%) progressed a median of 7.2 months following completion of therapy. Of the 6 progression-free, 4 demonstrated residual low-grade activity at sites of prior bone involvement (median follow-up 50.8 months), while 2 patients (stage I and IV disease) had limited follow-up (<8 months). Of 32 patients who were PET-negative, only 3 have progressed (median 7.7 months follow-up); 2 with stage IV (IPI 1 and 2 respectively) and 1 with stage I disease. Overall the Positive predictive value (PPV) of a positive-interim PET was 58.3% [Hazard Ratio of 6.67 (95% C.I. 2.6 \u2013 46.3)] and Negative PV(NPV) was 90.9% (see figure 1). Excluding patients with Stage IE bone lymphoma (see Figure 2), the PPV of positive-interim PET was 88%(77\u201398%) and NPV was 91%(82\u2013100%). The median number of chemotherapy cycles after which PET was performed was equivalent according to interim PET status (3 cycles) as was median baseline IPI [IPI 2(PET-positive), IPI 1.5(PET-negative); p=0.17]. CONCLUSIONS Patients with DLBCL receiving chemotherapy who have persisting PET-positivity during their therapy have a greatly increased risk of treatment failure and should be considered for treatment intensification. Bone lymphoma may represent a distinct entity with a good prognosis despite some minor persisting PET-positivity prior to completion of therapy.
