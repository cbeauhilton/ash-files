    "abstract_text": "Background: The FACT-Lym was developed to address the disease-specific quality-of-life (QOL) issues for patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL). Methods: Items for inclusion in the lymphoma subscale for the FACT instrument were generated from interviews with health care providers and published literature on NHL. Items were selected based on symptom relevance, disease-specificity and clinical relevance. Validation testing was conducted with NHL patients. Patients completed the FACT-Lym and other measures at three timepoints: baseline (T1), 3\u20137 days (T2), and 8\u201312 weeks (T3). These patients were also interviewed about item content. Results: From a pool of 69 items, 22 items were selected for testing based on relevance ratings of 17 experts. Items included B symptoms, sleep disturbance, anorexia, pruritus, pain, swelling, dyspnea, fatigue, emotional lability, worries, and uncertainty about the future. 75 NHL patients participated in validation testing (55% female, 59% with indolent disease, and 84% currently receiving treatment). Patient interviews confirmed item relevance and comprehensiveness. Item correlations, expert relevancy ratings, and patient input further reduced the subscale to 15 items. Internal consistency coefficients (alpha) for the 15\u2013item subscale (.80, .86, .83) and test-retest stability (.85) suggest very good reliability. Correlations between the subscale and the SF-36 physical (r=.62) and mental (r=.47) summary scores reflect concurrent validity. Responsiveness to ECOG performance status rating and treatment status (on vs. off) equaled or exceeded that of the more established FACT subscale scores. From T1 to T3, subscale scores declined (\u22126.8, effect size= \u22120.86) in 14 patients who reported themselves as worsened, increased (3.9, effect size= 0.49) in 28 patients who reported themselves as improved, and did not change (\u22120.2, effect size= \u22120.02) in 18 patients who reported themselves as unchanged. Conclusions: The FACT-Lym addresses QOL concerns that are relevant to NHL patients and is reliable and valid for use in clinical research.",
