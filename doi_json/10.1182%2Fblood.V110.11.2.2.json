    "abstract_text": "AMG 531 is a novel thrombopoiesis-stimulating peptibody that acts by stimulating the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor. We report efficacy data in splenectomized patients from a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AMG 531 in patients with chronic ITP. Sixty-three splenectomized patients were enrolled (placebo, 21; AMG 531, 42), with a median age of 52 years (range 26 to 88) and a mean baseline platelet count 14.7x10 9 /L. Subcutaneous AMG 531 or placebo was administered weekly for 24 weeks at a starting dose of 1\u03bcg/kg, and adjusted to maintain a target platelet count of 50\u2013200x10 9 /L. The primary study endpoint was the incidence of a durable platelet response, defined as a platelet count \u226550x10 9 /L for \u22656 weeks during the last 8 weeks of the 24 week treatment period in the absence of rescue medications. Sixteen of the 42 splenectomized patients (38.1%) receiving AMG 531 achieved a durable platelet response compared to 0/21 (0.0%) receiving placebo (p=0.0013). Overall response, defined as either durable or transient platelet response (\u22654 weekly platelet responses), was observed in 33/42 (78.6%) patients receiving AMG 531, compared to 0/21 (0%) placebo patients. The mean number of weekly platelet responses (platelet count \u226550x10 9 /L) was significantly greater in patients receiving AMG 531 (12.3/24 weeks, 51%) compared to placebo (0.2/24 weeks, 1%) (p25% their concurrent ITP medications. AMG 531 was well-tolerated. There were 2 treatment-related serious adverse events; 1 patient with elevated bone marrow reticulin that returned to baseline 3 months after withdrawal of AMG 531, and 1 patient experienced thrombosis that was successfully treated allowing study continuation. No patient developed neutralizing antibodies against either AMG 531 or endogenous TPO. In summary, AMG 531 was well-tolerated, and effectively increased and sustained platelet counts in splenectomized patients with ITP. AMG 531-treated patients required less frequent rescue medications in comparison to those receiving placebo, and were able to reduce their use of concurrent therapies."
