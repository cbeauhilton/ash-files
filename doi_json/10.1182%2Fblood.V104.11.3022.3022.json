    "abstract_text": "HIT is usually caused by platelet-activating antibodies of IgG class that bind to neoepitopes on platelet factor 4 (PF4) bound to heparin or certain other polyanions. Commercial enzyme-immunoassays (EIAs), however, measure PF4/polyanion-reactive antibodies of IgA and IgM class, in addition to IgG class antibodies. This raises the question: Does the detection of these IgA and IgM class antibodies improve HIT assay operating characteristics (perhaps because IgA and IgM are a marker for pathogenic HIT-IgG and/or for clinical HIT) or worsen operating characteristics (perhaps via detection of numerous non-HIT sera containing non-pathogenic IgA and/or IgM class antibodies)? We performed systematic serologic studies of 362 stored sera from a clinical trial of heparin therapy ( Arch Intern Med  2003 ; 163 : 2518 ) in which 12 patients developed HIT by clinical criteria (>50% platelet count fall) and 350 patients did not develop HIT. Assays used included: serotonin release assay (SRA); in-house PF4/heparin-EIA that individually detects IgG (EIA-G), IgA (EIA-A), and IgM (EIA-M) class antibodies; and commercial EIA from GTI (EIA-GTI). The 12 patients with clinical HIT tested strongly positive in the SRA, EIA-G, and EIA-GTI (Table 1). Positive tests among the 350 non-HIT patients (to calculate test specificity) were seen in 12 (SRA), 28 (EIA-G), and 69 (EIA-GTI) patients. Table 1.

Further, the magnitude of the IgA and IgM anti-PF4/heparin immune response did not differ between the 12 HIT patients, and the 69 non-HIT patients who had any PF4/polyanion immune response, as defined by a positive EIA-GTI without HIT (Table 2).

CONCLUSION: Detection of PF4/polyanion-reactive IgA and IgM class antibodies worsens the operating characteristics of HIT assays through the detection of numerous non-pathogenic antibodies, without any offsetting advantages in the detection of pathogenic HIT antibodies. Optimal diagnostic laboratory testing for HIT antibodies should include a platelet activation assay and an EIA that detects only IgG class antibodies reactive against PF4/heparin (or PF4/polyanion).",
