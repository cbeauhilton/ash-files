    "abstract_text": "Background: In multiple myeloma (MM), reproducible criteria of disease response and progression are critical to ensuring consistency in trial analysis and reporting. Regulatory Agencies responsible for drug approval often require clinical trials use objective endpoints that are evaluated by Independent Response Adjudication Committees (IRACs). The International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) has developed objective criteria to define disease evaluability, response, and progression (Durie, Leukemia 2006). However, there are scenarios were IMWG criteria are ambiguous, potentially leading to inconsistency amongst IRAC members or between different IRACs when interpreting response data. To address these practical issues, we developed rules for applying IMWG response criteria to the FIRST trial, the largest study in newly-diagnosed MM (Facon, Blood 2013). Patients and Methods: FIRST is a pivotal phase III trial for previously untreated patients with MM not eligible for ASCT that enrolled 1623 patients; the primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). At 12 in-person meetings between 2010-2013, the IRAC assessed eligibility, evaluability and response status of all patients after each cycle until PD or study discontinuation. These evaluations were used in the trial\u2019s primary analysis. Response was based on central laboratory values and assessed using IMWG criteria. For circumstances where IMWG criteria were ambiguous, rules were developed through unanimous consensus of IRAC members and then applied uniformly throughout the study. Results: Rules addressing identified issues on evaluability, response and progressive disease are shown in tables 1-3. Common situations posing a need for rules concerned to measurability, missing laboratory values, timing of BM exam to assess CR, discrepancies between screening and baseline lab values or measurements in the size of extramedullary plasmacytomas Conclusions: These recommendations provide explicit descriptions of response assessment of the FIRST trial, can be used for a more uniform evaluation and reporting in future clinical studies and can assist investigators\u2019 adherence to clinical trial requirements.
