    "abstract_text": "Background: Chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T) targeting CD19 have shown clinical efficacy in high-risk B-cell lymphomas, which has led to approval of 2 such therapies (axicabtagene ciloleucel and tisagenlecleucel) for large B-cell lymphoma after 2 lines of treatment. Despite the promising results, complete remission (CR) is achieved in ~ 50% of patients, and with longer follow-up progression-free survival is around 40%. Therefore, finding effective treatments for high-risk B-NHLs remains an unmet need. CD20 is a proven therapeutic target for B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (B-NHL), supported by previously approved naked and radiolabeled anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and a number of studies investigating novel bispecific antibodies targeting this antigen. CD20-targeted CAR-T is another potential adoptive immunotherapy option that could be utilized in combination or sequentially before or after CD19 CAR-T, depending on efficacy. Here, we present our ongoing phase I/II clinical trial investigating safety and efficacy of CD20 CAR-T for high-risk B-NHLs (NCT03277729). Methods: MB-106 is a fully human third-generation CD20 targeted CAR-T with both 4-1BB and CD28 costimulatory domains. In the phase I portion of the study we use a continual reassessment method dose escalation design to find the maximally tolerated dose. Lymphodepletion (LD) chemotherapy consists of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Patients (pts) will undergo a mandatory biopsy before LD to confirm the diagnosis and CD20 expression. A repeat research biopsy will be done between 10-16 days after CAR-T infusion (Figure 1). Except for the first patient of each dose cohort, treatment is given in the outpatient setting (Fred Hutch/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance) and pts will only be admitted to the University of Washington Medical Center if clinically indicated after CAR-T infusion. Response to treatment will be assessed on day 28 using Lugano criteria. Patients with relapsed or refractory CD20 positive B-NHL are eligible, including but not limited to DLBCL, primary mediastinal lymphoma, follicular lymphoma or other indolent histologies, and mantle cell lymphoma. Prior treatment with CD19 CAR-T is permitted as long as there is evidence of B-cell recovery in peripheral blood (\u2265 20 B cells/\u00b5l) as a functional test to rule out persistent CD19 CAR-Ts. Patients need to meet standard organ function criteria and have adequate blood counts (ANC >750, Hb >8.5, Plts >50,000). Patients with significant neurologic conditions, active CNS lymphoma, or need for systemic immunosuppressive therapy are excluded from the study.
