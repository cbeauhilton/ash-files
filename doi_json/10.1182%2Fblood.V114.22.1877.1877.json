    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1877 Poster Board I-902 Background: PD 0332991 (PD) a potent orally bioavailable small molecule, is the only known CDK4/CDK6-specific inhibitor. Through selective inhibition of CDK4/6, PD induces G1 cell cycle arrest thereby preventing DNA replication. As PD acts reversibly, it can induce synchronous G1-S progression upon its discontinuation. It has been shown that PD potently induces G1 arrest in primary human bone marrow (BM) myeloma cells/lines in the presence of BM stroma and prevents tumor growth in animal models (IC50, \u223c60 nM) (Baughn et al 2006). Moreover, it has been shown that induction of prolonged G1 arrest and synchronous S phase entry by PD profoundly enhances bortezomib (B) and dexamethasone (D) killing of primary BM myeloma cells in vitro and in animal models (Huang et al, unpublished). The synergistic anti-myeloma effect provides a compelling rationale for evaluating two methods of targeting CDK4/6 using PD in combination with B and D: a \u201cconcurrent regimen\u201d aims at enhancing B killing during prolonged G1 arrest and a \u201csequential regimen\u201d to enhance B killing during both G1 arrest and synchronous progression to S phase. Methods: Patients (pts) who had relapsed and refractory myeloma after at least 2 previous treatments and who were Rb positive were eligible. This phase 1 dose escalation study is being conducted to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the combination including dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). PD was given orally once a day for 3 weeks (21 days) followed by one week (7 days) off (Schedule A), starting on Day 1 of each cycle. B was given during G1 arrest by IV bolus together with 20 mg PO of D on Days 8, 11, 15 and 18 of each cycle (up to a maximum of 10 cycles). The study design followed a 3+3 dose-escalation scheme, with planned doses of PD/B starting from 100 mg/1.0 mg/m2 and escalating up to a maximum dose of 125 mg/1.3 mg/m2, respectively. Alternatively, in case of toxicity, de-escalation was planned to a minimum dose of 50 mg/0.7 mg/m2 for PD/B, respectively. Results: Nine patients were enrolled in Schedule A. Pt characteristics included 90% > SD stage II, 50% > ISS stage II with median \u03b22 M 4.0 (range 1.6\u201310.5), median serum albumin 3.8 (2.2\u20134.6), median Hgb 10.5 (8.1\u201314.4) and median calcium 9.9 (8.7\u201310.7) values at screening. The median number of prior therapies was 6 (2\u201310) with 7/9 pts showing progression to their latest prior therapy. One patient achieved VGPR (12.5%) while 1 patient each achieved MR and SD respectively for an ORR 25%. The VGPR and MR were achieved with the lowest dose combination (75 mg/0.7 mg/m2 PD/B). Six pts had progression of disease while on therapy. The most commonly reported adverse events were >Grade 3 reversible uncomplicated cytopenias. PD was absorbed relatively slowly with a median Tmax of 4 hours (range 2\u20138 hours). PD plasma exposures (normalized to the 100 mg dose level) ranged from 345\u20131128 ng.hr/mL for AUC 0\u201312 and from 36\u2013111 ng/mL for Cmax and were consistent with those observed in prior solid tumor studies. Immunohistochemistry of BM on Day 8 (prior to initiation of BD) in 7/8 pts demonstrated preferential and complete inhibition of CDK4/6-specific phosphorylation of Rb and Ki67 in tumor cells. Follow up BMs after 21 days, showed G1-S cell cycle progression upon PD withdrawal, confirming PDs synchronization effect. Conclusions: Targeting CDK4/6 with PD to induce prolonged G1 arrest in combination with B/D represents the first mechanism-based targeting of the cell cycle in cancer, and it appears to be effective in MM. Pts are being actively accrued to Schedule B consisting of sequential PD-B/D (12 days of PD followed by B/D as in Schedule A) to assess the safety of this novel schedule and the efficacy following cell cycle synchronization.
