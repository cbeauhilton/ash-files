    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1394 Background Herpes zoster incidence is higher in patients undergoing chemotherapy for hematologic malignancy [HM] (25-100 cases/1000 person-years) than in the general population (\u2242f3-5 cases/1000 person-years) and the general older adult population (7-12 cases/1000 person-years). The licensed live-attenuated zoster vaccine was heat-treated [ZV HT ] and assessed in adults with HM. Methods Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase I study of 4 ZV HT doses (\u2242f30 days apart) in adults \u226518 years with HM. Eighty subjects were enrolled, of whom 61 received ZV HT and 19 placebo (Pbo). Blood was collected at baseline and \u2242f28 days after each dose to measure (1) VZV antibody concentrations by glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA), and (2) varicella zoster virus (VZV) T-cell responses by interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT) assay. All vaccinated patients were evaluated for adverse events (AEs) through day 28 postdose 4. The primary hypothesis was that 4 doses of ZV HT would elicit a statistically significant VZV-specific immune response (lower bound of 90% CI on geometric mean fold rise [GMFR] >1.0) in adults with HM. Results Injection-site adverse events (AEs) occurred in 31.1% of the ZV HT group and 10.5% of the Pbo group. Of overall vaccine-related systemic AEs (ZV HT : 18.0%, Pbo: 15.8%), only nausea was reported by >10% in either group (ZV HT : 0.0%, Pbo: 10.5%). There were 2 reported vaccine-related serious AEs in the ZV HT group (vomiting, 2 days postdose 1; peripheral neuropathy, 6 days postdose 2). Four AEs resulting in death were reported in the ZV HT group (coronary arteriosclerosis, 24 days postdose 1; malignant neoplasm, 18 days postdose 2; leukemia, 10 days postdose 2; neutropenic sepsis, 48 days postdose 2), all deemed not vaccine-related by the investigator. Two subjects discontinued due to vaccine-related AEs (peripheral neuropathy, ZV HT 6 days postdose 2; nausea and vomiting, Pbo 2 days postdose 1). No ZV HT recipient had a rash that was PCR positive for the vaccine strain of VZV. Adverse Event Summary  . ZV HT Group (N=61) . Placebo Group (N=19) . n . (%) . n . (%) .

Both measures increased Postdose 4: gpELISA GMT was 262 (90% CI: 204, 336); IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT GMC was 24 (90% CI: 14, 41). The primary hypothesis was met, as Postdose 4 immune responses were significantly higher than baseline for both gpELISA (GMFR=1.3 [90% CI: 1.1, 1.5], p=0.003) and IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT (GMFR= 2.2 [90% CI: 1.4, 3.5], p=0.004).
