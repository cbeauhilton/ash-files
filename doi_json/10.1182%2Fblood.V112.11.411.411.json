    "abstract_text": "Platelet activation by agonists stimulates high affinity binding of adhesive ligands, such as fibrinogen, to integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23. In turn, ligand binding initiates Src kinase-dependent outside-in signaling, platelet spreading on sub-endothelial matrices, and platelet aggregation. Short-term integrin blockade by parenteral \u03b1IIb\u03b23 antagonists is effectively anti-thrombotic in certain clinical situations, but long-term blockade by oral \u03b1IIb\u03b23 antagonists has been problematic. As an alternative approach, we evaluated the feasibility of disrupting outside-in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 signaling in vivo. A \u201c\u03b23(\u0394760-762)\u201d knock-in mouse was generated that lacked the three C-terminal \u03b23 amino acid residues (RGT) necessary for \u03b1IIb\u03b23-dependent c-Src signaling, but retained \u03b23 residues necessary for agonist- and talin-dependent fibrinogen binding. \u03b23(\u0394760-762) mice were compared with wild-type \u03b23+/+ littermates, \u03b23+/\u2212 heterozygotes, and \u201c\u03b23/\u03b21(EGK)\u201d knock-in mice where \u03b23 RGT was replaced by three C-terminal residues in \u03b21 (EGK) to potentially enable outside-in integrin signaling by certain Src kinases other than c-Src. Whereas \u03b23+/+, \u03b23+/\u2212 and \u03b23/\u03b21(EGK) platelets spread and underwent tyrosine phosphorylation normally on fibrinogen, \u03b23(\u0394760-762) platelets spread poorly and exhibited reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src substrates, including the \u03b23 cytoplasmic domain itself (Tyr-747). Furthermore, unlike the three groups of control mice, all of the \u03b23(\u0394760-762) mice tested were protected from carotid artery occlusive thrombosis following vessel injury with FeCl3. The median tail bleeding time for the \u03b23(\u0394760-762) mice was approximately two-fold longer than that of the control mice. However, \u03b23(\u0394760-762) mice did not exhibit spontaneous bleeding, excess bleeding after surgical exposure of the carotid artery, fecal blood loss or anemia. Fibrinogen binding to \u03b23(\u0394760-762) platelets was normal in response to saturating concentrations of agonists to the PAR4 thrombin receptor or the GP VI collagen receptor; however, responses to ADP were impaired. These studies establish that deletion of \u03b23 RGT disrupts outside-in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 signaling and confers protection from arterial thrombosis in vivo. Currently available anti-platelet drugs either inhibit agonist-induced activation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 or block fibrinogen binding to the integrin. The studies reported here suggest that targeting outside-in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 signaling may represent an alternative anti-thrombotic strategy."
