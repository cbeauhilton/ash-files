    "abstract_text": "Traditionally, the focus of anti-tumor immunity has been on CD8+ CTL responses. It is now realized that CD4+ T cells play a relevant role in protective anti-tumor responses. HLA Class II molecules are expressed on AML blasts, predicting that AML cells may stimulate CD4+ T cells. Based on our studies of inducing AML dendritic cell (AMLDC) differentiation and priming in situ AML-reactive T cells, we developed a novel method of generating multiple autologous AML reactive T cell lines by competitive limiting dilution (LD) AML MNC culture. Most autologous AML reactive T cell lines generated from this culture were CD4+. These CD4+ T cell lines with high IFN-gamma secretion in response to autologous AML cells showed low to moderate specific lysis of autologous AML cells in 4-hour 51 Cr release assays. However, co-culture assays demonstrated that these CD4+ AML reactive T cell lines exerted intense cytotoxicity toward autologous AML cells, depleting more than 95% of autologous AML line cells in 2 days, and more than 99% in 7 days, with no or weak toxicity to allogeneic AML cells and cell lines, HL60, NB4, U937 KG1a and ak LCL cell line. Anti-HLA class II, Dr, Dp, Dq mAb (67\u00b116% inhibition) and anti-HLA-Dr mAb (69\u00b111% inhibition) but not anti-HLA class I mAb significantly inhibited IFN-gamma secretion of six CD4+ T cell lines stimulated by autologous AML cells confirmed the HLA class II restriction of reactivity of these CD4+ T cell lines. Flow cytometry analysis showed that these CD4+ T cell lines induced significant Annexin-V expression on autologous AML cells. The induction of Annexin-V+ on AML cells by CD4+ T cell lines correlated significantly with IFN-gamma secretion in response to autologous AML cells (n=11; r=0.84). This result suggested that the most important mechanism of autologous AML cell elimination by CD4+ AML reactive T cells generated from LD-AML-MNC cultures was apoptosis induction related to IFN-gamma secretion.",
