    "abstract_text": "Haploinsufficiency in genes encoding ribosomal proteins (RP) or ribosome-associated proteins either by mutation or deletion leads to a predominant erythroid phenotype. In acquired 5q- myelodysplasic syndrome (MDS), the macrocytic anemia has been linked to the monoallelic deletion of RPS14 gene which results in altered ribosome biogenesis. Because of the defective maturation of the small 40S ribosome subunit, the RPL5/RPL11/5SrARN complex, normally involved in the assembly of the large 60S subunit assembly, accumulates and inhibits E3-ligase-HDM2 leading to the stabilization and activation of p53 resultig in cell cycle arrest, increased apoptosis and defective differentiation of maturing erythroblasts. In the present work, we hypothesized that p53 could play a key role in the control of normal erythroid differentiation by ribosome biogenesis and we further investigated the involvement of the decreased pool of ribosome on erythroid defects in the 5q- syndrome. To investigate the first hypothesis, we studied the kinetics of ribosome biogenesis in human primary erythroblasts by mass spectrometry after pulse-SILAC. We noted that ribosome renewal collapses begining at the polychromatophilic erythroblast stage. We subsequently used the pharmacological agent CX-5461 to inhibit RNA polymerase I. When ribosome biogenesis in proerythroblasts is blocked by CX-5461, p53 is activated and proerythroblasts enter the terminal differentiation by expressing GATA1-erythroid target genes without apoptosis. By ChIP-seq in primary erythroblasts, we demonstrated that p53 binds to 1289 genes including 263 genes specifically activated by CX-5461, 6 of them being upregulated during CX-5461-induced erythroid differentiation and 3 of them being known GATA1 targets. We further used an shRNA strategy to demonstrate that one of these genes is required to permit entry into terminal erythroid differentiation when ribosome biogenesis is abrogated. We thus showed that normal erythroid differentiation is controlled by ribosome biogenesis through a p53-dependent checkpoint. In 5q- syndrome, ribosome biogenesis is continuously decreased along all stages of erythropoiesis and in contrast to the normal conditions, erythroid differentiation is defective with an excess of apoptosis affecting mature erythroblasts. We previously reported that GATA1 is targeted by a caspase-dependent cleavage since GATA1 is not protected by its chaperone HSP70 in the nucleus of MDS erythroblasts. We confirmed that GATA1 protein is decreased in 5q- primary erythroblasts and in RPS14 shRNA-expressing normal erythroblasts. To obtain further insights into the defective erythroid maturation of RPS14-deleted erythroblasts, we developed an inducible shRNA to RPS14 in the UT7/Epo cell line. Polysome profiling confirmed the decrease of 40S subunit and absolute quantification of RP by deep proteomics demonstrated a 50% decrease of RPS in conjunction with 50% reduction of ribosome content in these cells. GATA1 expression was decreased and was only partially rescued by treatment with either caspase inhibitor qVD or proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib. We then tested the hypothesis of a decrease in GATA1 translation, as previously shown in a shRNA RPS19 Diamond-Blackfan model, by analyzing and comparing the global transcriptome and the translatome corresponding to transcripts present in high molecular weight polysomes using Affymetrix HTA 2.0 microarrays. We observed a decoupling between transcriptome and translatome suggesting a selectivity of translational defects. Thermodynamic characteristics i.e. the fold energy, energy per base and length of the 3'UTR and the energy per base of the 5'UTR (Vienna RNA Package, UCSC genome browser) were the determinants of transcript selection on the polysome. The shortest transcripts with a highly structured 3'UTR including GATA1 were the transcripts which were less effectively translated. Consistently, the diminution of GATA1 protein was associated with a decrease of its target genes. Our results suggest that GATA1 is a potentially interesting therapeutic target. In summary, our results show that ribosome biogenesis controls erythroid differentiation via a p53-dependent transcriptional regulation and that a reduction of the ribosome pool leads to a selective translation at the expense of erythroid master gene GATA1.
