    "abstract_text": "Abstract 64 Megakaryocytes are one of the few cell types that undergo a modified form of the cell cycle termed endomitosis, in which cells skip the late stages of mitosis to become polyploid. Murine and human megakaryocytes commonly reach modal ploidy states of 32N and 16N, respectively, and can sometimes achieve DNA contents as high as 64N. Polyploidization is associated with upregulation of megakaryocyte lineage specific genes, proplatelet formation and expression of genes related to apoptosis. RNA expression array studies have shown that high ploidy states are strongly correlated with megakaryocyte differentiation and maturation. Importantly, the choice of a megakaryocyte to undergo polyploidization and differentiation is inextricably linked to exit from the proliferative cell cycle. Given that megakaryocytes in patients with essential thrombocythemia are hyperproliferative and that those in primary myelofibrosis fail to undergo normal differentiation or polyploidization, we hypothesized that small molecule inducers of polyploidization would drive these cells to exit the proliferative cell cycle and undergo terminal differentiation or death. In collaboration with the Broad Institute, we performed a high throughput screen and identified small molecules that induce polyploidization and proliferative arrest of malignant megakaryocytes, including those that express MPLW515L and JAK2 V617F. We have shown that these compounds, including the Rho kinase inhibitor dimethylfasudil (diMF), selectively increase polyploidization, expression of megakaryocyte cell surface markers, and apoptosis of murine and human megakaryocytic cell lines and primary cells. Furthermore, diMF blocked the growth of primary human AMKL blasts both in vitro and in vivo. With respect to MPNs, diMF showed potent activity against megakaryocytic cell lines and primary cells expressing either JAK2 V617F or MPL W515L alleles commonly associated with these disorders. diMF inhibited proliferation, induced polyploidization and upregulation of lineage specific markers CD41 and CD42, and increased apoptosis of megakaryocytes transduced with JAK2 V617F or MPLW515L. diMF also significantly reduced megakaryocyte colony forming units (CFU-MK), and induced polyploidization and differentiation of bone marrow and fetal liver megakaryocytes from Gata1 mutant mice, which develop a PMF-like disease. Given that diMF induces growth arrest, polyploidization and apoptosis of cells that express activated mutants of JAK2 and MPL, we predicted that it, as well as other small molecule inducers of polyploidy, would be efficient at restraining aberrant megakaryocyte proliferation in both PMF and ET. To assay the effectiveness of diMF in these disorders, we treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with either PMF or ET with diMF and monitored growth and maturation of megakaryocytes. We discovered that diMF induced polyploidization and subsequent apoptosis of both types of MPN primary samples. diMF also reduced CFU-MK of these MPN patient samples. Next, we assessed the activity of diMF in a model of MPN in which congenic recipients of MPLW515L transduced Balb/C bone marrow cells develop a rapid MPN characterized by leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, bone marrow fibrosis, and death. diMF led to a significant decrease of fibrosis in the bone marrow, diminished infiltration of megakaryocytes and granulocytes in the liver, and a profound reduction in the numbers of megakaryocytes within the spleen of a mouse model of PMF. diMF also led to a significant reduction in the platelet count and a trend towards decreased white cell count, with no effect on hematocrit. Overall, diMF results were comparable to intermediate doses of INCB16562. These encouraging results strongly suggest that diMF induces a decline in megakaryocyte lineage, which leads to reduction in platelet count, and support pre-clinical development of diMF for megakaryocytic subtypes of MPNs. Of note, diMF did not inhibit the phosphorylation of Stat5 or Stat3, suggesting that it acts through a mechanism distinct from JAK2 inhibitors. Interestingly, combination of diMF with a selective JAK2 inhibitor greatly enhanced the efficacy of diMF to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in MPLW515L transduced megakaryocytic cell line. These data support combining JAK inhibition and induction of megakaryocyte polyploidy as a new therapeutic strategy for MPNs. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
