    "abstract_text": "Clinical comorbidity measures enhance the estimates of HCT tolerance and outcomes, thereby aiding therapeutic decisions. Ex vivo T cell depletion (TCD) of the graft reduces the risk of graft-versus-host disease and improves the tolerability of allogeneic transplantation in patients with impaired pretransplant performance. However, prediction tools such as the hematopoietic cell transplantation-specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI), have only been validated in conventional T-replete HCT. To improve outcome prediction in TCD transplants we therefore evaluated published comorbidity measures and other potential biomarkers of outcome in a series of myeloablative TCD transplant recipients. Pre transplant (week -2) factors measured were: HCT-CI, ECOG performance status, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin (ALB), pre-albumin (PAB), ferritin, absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC), and absolute lymphocyte / monocyte ratio (LMR). CRP was also studied serially post transplant. CRP increased after conditioning, peaked (p =0.0001) in the first week of HCT, with recovery to baseline at 5 weeks post-HCT. We evaluated outcomes in a cohort of 79 patients in our institute with hematological malignancies receiving myeloablative total-body irradiation, and an HLA-identical sibling peripheral blood HCT, T cell depleted using Miltenyi CD34+ selection. The median age of recipients was 43 years (range 13-68 years). Of the 79, 34 (43%) had standard risk disease, and 45 (57%) recipients had high-risk disease. At a median follow up of \u223c 5 years, overall survival (OS) was 42.9% and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 33.9%. Comorbidity measures were first screened to eliminate highly-correlated covariates. Univariate Cox regression models were used to identify significant factors (p 0 were found to be significantly associated with the cumulative incidence of relapse (both p=0.01). In conclusion, this is the first study to explore comorbidity scores and biomarkers to predict outcome after ex vivo TCD HCT. Our results suggest that HCT-CI score, preCRP, postCRP and the LMR are important independent clinical predictors of OS and NRM in TCD HCT. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
