    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4691 Introduction Amyloid precursor protein(APP) gene was increasingly expressed in solid tumors, promoted the proliferation of tumor cells and the overexpression of APP was a bad prognostic factor to oral squamous cell carcinoma. However, little has been known about the clinical significance and role of APP in acute myeloid leukemia(AML). Methods The expressions of APP mRNA in 85 AML patients and 20 nonmalignant hematological diseases that worked as control were measured by real-time PCR and the expressions of APP in AML cell lines were examined by real-time PCR and western blot. Small interfering RNAs(siRNAs) targeting APP gene were synthesized and transfected into HL60 cell by lipofectamine2000, after RNAi 24h, 48h and 72h, cell growth of HL60 was measured by trypan blue dye exclusion method and MTT, differentiation was observed by Wright-Giemsa staining, cell cycle was examined by PI/RNase staining, apoptosis induction was analyzed by Annexin V/PI and Hoechst33342 staining; apoptosis-related proteins NF-\u03baB, bcl-2 and Caspase-3 were detected by Western blot after RNAi 48h; sensitivity of HL60 to adrimycin was measured by MTT. Results The expression of APP mRNA among AML subtypes was significantly different( P =0.019), M2 with t(8;21) was the highest expression subtype and M5b was the lowest. APP expression had no significant effect on AML clinical characteristic excepting AML subtypes. kasumi-1 was the highest expression cell in AML cell lines and U937 was the lowest( P <0.05), and the expression of APP in HL60/ADM was significantly lower than HL60( P <0.05). The APP expressions in AML cell lines was in agreement with its expressions in primary AML subtypes. After RNAi 24h, 48h, and 72h, no significant differences in proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, cell cycle and sensitivity of HL60 to adriamycin were detected between interfering group and control groups. Conclusions The APP mRNA expression in M2 with t(8;21) was high and M5b was low. Down-regulation of APP expression had no significant effect on biological behaviour of HL60 and APP was not tightly related to pathogenesis of AML.
