    "abstract_text": "The FLT3 receptor is a potential target in AML due to its role in leukemogenesis and its high degree of expression on blasts from approximately 90% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. In addition, mutant forms of FLT3, including internal tandem duplications (ITD) in the juxtamembrane region and point mutations in the kinase domain, constitutively activate FLT3 signaling. ITD mutations in particular are also associated with poor prognosis. A number of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) against FLT3 are currently in clinical trials and have shown some clinical activity. However, TKIs have various limitations, including their lack of specificity, which may produce toxicities, and can select for drug resistant cells. In an attempt to overcome some of these limitations and to generate new agents which might cooperate in targeting FLT3, we generated a fully humanized phage display monoclonal antibody (EB10). This antibody is capable of inhibiting both ligand-activated wild-type and, to a lesser degree, ligand-independent mutant FLT3 signaling. When EB10 is used to treat cells expressing activated FLT3, inhibition of downstream pathways including STAT5, AKT and MAPK are also frequently seen. EB10 treatment of cells expressing FLT3 in the presence of NK cells leads to antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). EB10 treatment of NOD/SCID mice injected with FLT3 expressing AML cell lines or with primary AML blasts significantly prolongs survival and/or reduces engraftment of leukemic cells. EB10 proved efficacious in vivo against cells even when in vitro EB10 treatment did not significantly reduce FLT3 signaling. This indicates that ADCC may be the primary mechanism mediating cytotoxicity as opposed to direct FLT3 inhibition. In contrast to the effects on AML cell lines and primary samples, EB10 treatment did not significantly reduce NOD/SCID engraftment of normal human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. Anti-FLT3 antibodies, like EB10, may be a promising therapeutic agent that can specifically target malignant cells with limited toxicities against normal hematopoietic stem cells and should be considered for clinical trials.",
