    "abstract_text": "This analysis studied 197 autologous HSCT performed in 132 patients treated for multiple myeloma (MM) in our center between 2000 and 2007. There were 53 females and 79 males with a median age of 56.8 years (34\u201372). At diagnosis there were 71 IgG (49\u03ba, 22\u03bb), 26 IgA (15\u03ba,11\u03bb), 2 IgD (1\u03ba, 1\u03bb), 27 light chain (18\u03ba,9\u03bb), 2 plasma cell leukemia, 3 non secretory, 1 non secretory/non excretory. There were 11 stage I (10A and 1B), 12 IIA, 96 III(75A and 21B) and 13 not classified. At diagnosis, 24/98pts had a del(13), and 65/179 had high levels of \u03b22microglobulin. Before 2004, 50% of transplants were done and the median interval between diagnosis and HSCT was 7.8 months (3.5\u2013131). We divided the population into 2 groups (I = 65: double-auto, II = 67 simple auto). The disease status pre-transplant according to the number of apheresis were: 1 apheresis (group I: 3CR, 29PR, 3SD, 1PD; group II: 2CR, 24PR, 3PD), 2 apheresis (group I: 16PR, 1SD, 1PD; group II: 3CR, 9PR, 1PD), 3 apheresis (group I: 1CR, 4PR; group II: 10PR, 1unknown), 4 apheresis (group I: 4PR, 1PD; group II: 1CR, 10PR, 2SD), 6 apheresis (group II: 1PR) and 8 apheresis (group: 1PR). PBSC were mobilized in steady state in 135 cases, 53 after cyclophosphamide alone, 9 cyclophosphamide with other drugs. During mobilization, we used GCSF in 179cases, GM-CSF in 5cases, SCF in 4 cases and associations of GM-CSF+ GCSF in 2(1%) cases and SCF+GCSF in 7(3.5%) cases. The median number of infused cells were: TNC 5\u00d710 7 /kg (1\u201359), CFU-GM 70.5\u00d710 4 /kg (0\u20132616) and CD34+cells 3\u00d710 6 /kg (0\u201327). Of these, 115 (58%) had a number of CD34+cells<4\u00d710 6 /kg and 82 (42%) \u22654\u00d710 6 /kg. As conditioning regimens, all pts received melphalan alone with a median total dose of 304mg [130\u2013440]. After transplantation, 156(79%) have received growth factors [1(0.5%) GM-CSF, 148 (95%) G-CSF and 7 (4.5%) SCF] and 195 pts well engrafted (99%). Concerning red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, 60% of pts did not received any RBC transfusions, 30% received between 1 and 4 transfusions, 7% between 5 and 8 and 3% 10 or more and concerning platelet (Pt) transfusions, 35,5% did not received any Pt transfusions, 53% received between 1 and 3, 9% between 4 and 7 and 2.5% 10 or more. The median number of RBC and Pt transfusions were 0 [0\u201323] and 1 [0\u201320] respectively. The median number of days with neutrophils <0.5G/L was 6 (0\u201333) and with Pt<50G/L 17 (2\u2013104) and the median length of hospitalization for auto transplantation was 18 days (14\u201354). The probability of 5-year overall and event-free survival (OS and EFS) were 64.3% (56.3\u201373.4%) and 32.4% (24.9\u201342.2%) and the median OS was not reached. Among all pts, 25 received an allogeneic HSCT as further treatment. Statistical analysis studied age disease status at transplant infused TNC, CD34+cell and CFU-GM, growth factors during mobilization and after transplantation, mobilization chemotherapy, interval Diag-T and transplantation period in a conditional logistic-regression model to analyze associations between these variables and length of hospitalization, number of RBC and Pt transfusions; a multivariate analysis using Cox model to analyze the impact of these variables on length of aplasia (<0.5G/L neutrophils and <50G/L Pt). We observed no significant impact of all studied variables on length of hospitalization and RBC transfusions and a significant negative impact of long interval diagnosis-T (p=0.05) and of the period > 2004 on Pt transfusion number (p=0.03). We showed a significant positive impact of CFU-GM number [HR=1 (1000\u20131.002) (p=0.03)] and growth factor use after transplantation [HR=0.55 (0.36\u20130.85) (p=0.005)] on days <0.5 G/L neutrophils and a significant negative impact of CD34+cell<4 \u00d710 6 /kg on the number of days <50G/L Pt ([HR=1.65 (1.09\u20132.50) (p=0.01)]. A more refined analysis of the groups, as well as a medico-economic analysis are ongoing and will be presented. In conclusion, this retrospective analysis showed an interesting long-term overall survival probability for this high risk MM population. We demonstrated no apparent impact of the pre-transplant, mobilization, and graft variables on number of transfusions and the length of hospitalization in this global analysis. However, we did show a significant influence of the diagnosis-T interval on platelet transfusions and of the CD34+ cell number, GCSF post-transplant and CFU-GM number on the length of aplasia.",
