    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4643 Background: The thrombopoietin-receptor agonist (TPOra) romiplostim is recommended for second-line treatment of adult ITP (Provan, Blood 2010). Romiplostim registration studies were conducted in selected patient (pt) populations and may not reflect clinical practice. Moreover, regional variations may exist in the clinical utility of romiplostim. A recent French study enrolled adult ITP pts failing previous treatments and receiving romiplostim on a compassionate use basis before commercial availability (Khellaf, Blood 2011). We report interim data from French pts enrolled in a large observational study of romiplostim use in clinical practice, with broader inclusion criteria. Methods: This ongoing study enrolls ITP pts \u226518 years old, who have received romiplostim in clinical practice. Pts participating in another study, who initiated romiplostim prior to commercial launch or received other TPOra or related products are excluded. Data recorded as per clinical practice is collected for up to 2 years following romiplostim initiation. Study outcomes include pt characteristics (at romiplostim initiation), romiplostim dose, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and bleeds, summarized for pts meeting the eligibility criteria (Full Analysis Set; FAS). Amgen (Europe) GmbH funded the study and medical writing assistance. Results: As of February 2012, 86 (95%) of 91 pts enrolled in France were included in the FAS. Of these, 59% (51/86) remained on study, 31% (27/86) had completed the 2-year observation period and 9% (8/86) had withdrawn (death, 6 [7%]; lost to follow-up, 2 [2%]). At romiplostim initiation, median (Q1, Q3) age, weight and platelet count were 65.0 (48.0, 77.0) years, 74.00 (62.20, 84.00) kg and 18.0 (7.0, 31.0) \u00d7 10 9 /L; 38% (33/86) of pts had been diagnosed with ITP for < 1 year (median [Q1, Q3] time from diagnosis, 3.04 [0.51, 13.04] years), 74% (64/86) had received \u22653 prior ITP therapies, 71% (61/86) had received prior rituximab, 30% (26/86) were splenectomised and 52% (45/86) female. Romiplostim was initiated at 1 and \u22653 \u03bcg/kg/week in 63% (54/86) and 24% (21/86) of pts; 36% (31/86) of pts stopped romiplostim before the end of the 2-year observation period, with requirement for alternative therapy (11 [13%]), haemostatic platelet count/no further treatment necessary (6 [7%]; last platelet count before romiplostim stopped, 68\u2013616 \u00d7 10 9 /L; 1 pt splenectomised, 4 had ITP disease duration of 50 \u00d7 10 9 /L thereafter (Figure). Grade \u22653 bleeds were rare and occurred at a lower rate after romiplostim initiation (Table). The most commonly reported ADRs were thrombocytosis, asthenia, myalgia and headache (9.7\u20133.2 events per 100 pt-years). Three pts reported a total of 6 serious ADRs: pulmonary embolism, 2 events; deep vein thrombosis, drug ineffective, myelofibrosis (initial disease diagnosis inconsistent with ITP, myelofibrosis more likely due to MDS), and thrombocytosis (platelets 477 \u00d7 10 9 /L), 1 event each. No fatal ADRs were reported. View large Download slide Platelet counts View large Download slide Platelet counts  Close modal Grade \u22653 Bleeds *  . FAS (N=86) . . Before rom initiation .

View Large Summary/conclusions: This study provides further insight into the clinical utility of romiplostim in France. At an interim analysis, pts tended to have less chronic disease than those enrolled in a previous observational study (Khellaf, Blood 2011). With lower doses than reported by Khellaf, and no new safety signals, pts achieved sustained increases in platelet counts and experienced a lower rate of grade \u22653 bleeds following romiplostim initiation.
