    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1790 CLL is incurable with conventional therapies and prognosis is poor in patients with relapsed or treatment refractory disease. Patients with purine analogue refractory disease and defective TP53 function have limited therapeutic options. Based on: 1) The ability of purine analogues to decrease tumor burden; 2) Higher response rates in patients treated with alemtuzumab and rituximab vs. alemtuzumab alone; and 3) Data showing that more frequent lower doses of rituximab could be more effective than standard therapy, we hypothesized that combination therapy with pentostatin, alemtuzumab and low dose rituximab (PAR) would be effective and tolerable therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory CLL and those with previously untreated progressive CLL who had 17p13-. This two stage phase II University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic Lymphoma SPORE clinical trial ( NCT00669318 ) was approved by Mayo Clinic and the University of Iowa IRBs according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The aims are to assess: 1) Complete (CR) and overall responses; and 2) Progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response, and time to next treatment (TTT). Patients with progressive CLL (including the SLL variant) defined by standard criteria are eligible for this study if they had either previously treated CLL or previously untreated CLL with 17p13-. Cycle 1 of therapy is 5 weeks with rituximab 20 mg/m 2 /d IV Mon-Wed-Fri starting day 1, subQ alemtuzumab beginning days 3\u20135 with a dose escalation (3 mg\u201310 mg\u2013 30 mg/d) and then 30 mg/d Mon-Wed-Fri, and pentostatin 2mg/m 2 /dose/IV days 8 & 22. Cycles 2\u20133 are each of 4 weeks duration and are the same as weeks 2\u20135 of cycle 1. Patients who achieve CR after cycle 2 with a negative CT scan and bone marrow study with no evidence of residual CLL cells after immunohistochemical staining, do not receive cycle 3 of therapy. All patients receive granulocyte growth factor support after pentostatin therapy as well as PCP and herpes virus prophylaxis. Patients are tested for CMV reactivation by PCR weekly during therapy and treated with valganciclovir if reactivation is detected. We report the results of the planned interim analysis performed after completion of therapy for the first 19 patients (July 2008 - October 2010). The median patient age was 63 years (range 47\u201378) with 74% males. Two patients with 17p13- were previously untreated. Of the 17 previously treated patients (median 2 prior regimens, range 1\u20136), 8 (47%) had purine analogue refractory CLL (disease progression < 6 months of treatment). Nine (47%) patients had advanced clinical stage (Rai III-IV). Adverse molecular prognostic factors were 17p13- (n=8, 42%, 2 also had 11q22-), 11q22- (n=1), unmutated IGHV (12/17, 71%), ZAP70+ (\u226520%, 12/17, 71%) and CD38+ (\u226530%, 6/18, 33%). The median beta-2-microglobulin level was 4.3 (range 2.4 \u2013 12.6). Grade 3\u20134 treatment related toxicities were 9 non-hematological and 20 hematological events. Grade 3\u20134 infections occurred in 3 patients including one patient requiring hospitalization for CMV re-activation. Fourteen (74%) patients responded to treatment with 6 (32%) CR (includes 2 CRi) and 8 (42%) partial responses (PR). Five (26%) patients had stable disease (SD). Eleven (58%) patients completed 3 cycles of therapy. One patient achieved a CR with no residual disease after 2 cycles of therapy and received no further treatment per protocol. Median duration of response is 7 months (95% CI: 4\u2013not reached (NR)). Among the 8 patients with 17p13- there were 3 CR/CRi, 4 PR, and 1 SD. Four patients proceeded to allogeneic transplant with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and were censored for TTT at the initiation of transplant related therapy. With a median of 16 (range 6 \u2013 35) months of follow up, median PFS is 7 months (95% CI: 5\u2013NR), median TTT is 27 months (95% CI: 5-NR) and the calculated median overall survival is 23 months (95% CI: 14\u2013NR). We report that PAR is effective and tolerable therapy in this population of relapsed refractory patients with high to very-high risk CLL. In addition, the responses in patients with 17p13- were similar to that of the patients who did not have 17p13-. The treatment regimen was useful for disease control in 3 patients who proceeded to reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic transplantation. This study shows that PAR could play an important role in the treatment of recurrent and high risk CLL.
