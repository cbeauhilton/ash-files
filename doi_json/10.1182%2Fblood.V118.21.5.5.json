    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5 Background: Hemophilia B (HB), an X-linked bleeding disorder, is ideally suited for gene therapy. We investigated a novel approach using peripheral vein infusion of a single dose of a serotype-8 pseudotyped self-complementary adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing a codon-optimized coagulation factor IX (FIX) transgene (scAAV2/8-LP1-hFIXco). Methods: Six severe HB subjects (FIX \u22641%) were enrolled sequentially into one of three dose cohorts with two subjects in each group. Vector was administered without immunosuppression. The subjects were followed for 6\u201316 months post treatment. Results: AAV-mediated expression of FIX at 2\u201311% of normal was observed in all subjects. Four of the six have discontinued prophylaxis and remain free of spontaneous hemorrhage. The other two have increased the interval between FIX prophylaxes. A high-dose subject developed asymptomatic, transient elevation of serum transaminases associated with detection of AAV8 capsid specific T cells in peripheral blood. The second high-dose subject experienced a slight increase of liver enzymes, of less clear etiology. Treatment of each with a short course of steroids led to rapid normalization of the transaminases and maintenance of FIX levels in the 3\u201311% range. Conclusion: Peripheral vein administration of scAAV2/8-LP1-hFIXco was well tolerated and resulted in FIX transgene expression at levels sufficient to improve the bleeding phenotype. Immune-mediated clearance of AAV-transduced hepatocytes remains a concern but our data suggest that this process may be controlled with a short course of steroids without loss of transgene expression. Hence, our novel approach shows promise for gene therapy of HB and other protein deficiencies.
