    "abstract_text": "Background and Aims A novel genetic subtype of B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is characterized by rearrangement of NUTM1 ( NUTM1 r) on 15q14 resulting in fusion of NUTM1 to one of several partner genes such as CUX1 , ACIN1 , BRD9 , and IKZF1 . The downstream effects of NUTM1 r include upregulation of the proto-oncogene BMI1 and specific fusions also induce transcription of the HOXA gene cluster (Hormann et al. Haematologica 2019; Li et al. PNAS 2018). This novel subtype is rare in children, but appears to be more prevalent among infants negative for KMT2A rearrangement ( KMT2A r) based on the frequency of karyotypic 15q aberrations (De Lorenzo et al. Leukemia 2014). This international collaborative study aimed to determine the frequency of NUTM1 r in infant and pediatric cohorts, and to characterize the demographic, clinical and molecular features of NUTM1 r-positive B-ALL. Patients and Methods Interfant-related study groups provided NUTM1 screening results for KMT2A r-negative Interfant-99 and -06 cases with karyotypic 15q aberration, normal karyotype, or missing karyotype. Additionally, NUTM1 r-positive cases of any age were collected from the study groups united in the Ponte di Legno consortium. The identified NUTM1 r-positive children were diagnosed between 1995-2019, infants (\u2264365 days of age) included in the Interfant-99 or 06 trials were diagnosed between 2000-2016, and remaining infants between 1986-2019. The techniques used for the detection of NUTM1 r were break-apart FISH, RNA sequencing, and RT-PCR. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated according to Kaplan-Meier, standard error according to Greenwood, and the curves were compared by log-rank test. Results We identified 81 NUTM1 r cases, including 35 Interfant-enrolled infants, 10 other infants and 36 children. NUTM1 r was reported to be rare among pediatric B-ALL with an estimated frequency range of 0.28-0.86%. The median age among NUTM1 r-positive children was 4.5 years (range 1-15). Among KMT2A r-negative infants the frequency of NUTM1 r was 21.7%. Of NUTM1 r-positive infants, 54% were <6 months at diagnosis (median 5.6, range 0.4-11.0 months) compared with 16% in the remaining KMT2A r-negative infants (median 9.3, range 0.1-11.9; p<0.0001). Other baseline characteristics (WBC, gender, prednisone poor response) were similar between NUTM1 r-positive and -negative infants. Of the NUTM1 r-positive cases, all achieved complete remission, 82% had minimal residual disease <10e-4 at the end of induction, and no patient received stem cell transplant in first remission. The 4-year EFS was 100% in Interfant-enrolled NUTM1 r-positive patients versus 74% (95% CI 65.1-81.0, p=0.001) in the remaining KMT2A r-negative cases (n=126). The better outcome was confirmed also after adjusting for WBC, gender and prednisone response (p=0.0001). The 4-year OS were 100% and 88.0% (95% CI 80.5-92.7) for NUTM1 r-positive and other KMT2A r-negative infant cases, respectively (p-value=0.04). Children and non-Interfant-enrolled infants treated on different treatment protocols showed 89.4% (95% CI 78.6-1) 4-year EFS and 100% 4-year OS. In order of frequency, NUTM1 fusion partners were ACIN1 (30.4%), CUX1 (21.7%), BRD9 (17.4%), ZNF618 (13%), AFF1 (4.3%), SLC12A6 (4.3%), IKZF1 (2.9%), and three novel partners: ATAD5 (2.9%), CHD4 (1.4%) and RUNX1 (1.4%). Infants mainly showed fusions with ACIN1 , CUX1 , BRD9 and AFF1 , associated with HOXA9 upregulation. Older infants and children showed both HOXA -upregulating and non- HOXA -upregulating fusions. Epigenetic profiling showed a distinct pattern of DNA methylation and histone modification of the HOXA gene cluster region in leukemic cells of an ACIN1-NUTM1 pediatric case compared with KMT2A r-positive and KMT2A r/ NUTM1 r-negative pediatric cases. Conclusions NUTM1 r ALL was identified as the second largest subtype in infants, found in 21.7% of KMT2A r-negative infant B-ALL, representing 5-7% of total infant ALL, and associated with excellent outcome on Interfant standard risk protocols. The favorable outcome was confirmed in the Ponte di Legno cohort of infant and pediatric NUTM1 r-positive patients enrolled on different treatment protocols over more than two decades. We conclude that NUTM1 r ALL is a favorable genetic subtype in infants and children and possibly eligible for treatment reduction. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
