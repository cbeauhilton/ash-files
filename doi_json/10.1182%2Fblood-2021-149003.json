    "abstract_text": "Bone marrow suppression and associated neutropenia that renders the patient more susceptible to infection is a major complication and limiting factor for current chemotherapy. Strategies aimed at neutrophil reconstitution using transfusions or accelerating neutrophil recovery with G-CSF show a limited effect in reducing the rate of infection. To overcome these limitations, administration of ex vivo expanded somatic hematopoietic progenitors (HPs) has been explored as a way to facilitate a more rapid myeloid recovery and improve overall survival following myeloablation. Recent advances in reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technologies have created alternative platforms for off-the-shelf supply of immunologically compatible HPs, including cellular products derived from MHC homozygous superdonors which can increase the degree of MHC matching and may provide a maximum utility for stem cell banking. In these studies, we developed Mauritian cynomolgus macaque (MCM) model to evaluate the utility and safety of CD34 + CD45 + hematopoietic progenitors derived from iPSCs (iHPs) generated from MHC homozygous animals in the treatment of cytopenia following myeloablative stem cell transplantation. MCM iPSCs were generated from MHC homozygous animals and used to generate iHPs in coculture with OP9. Three groups of MCMs underwent myeloablative total body irradiation (TBI) followed by transplantation of cryopreserved autologous CD34 + HSPCs. Four days after autologous HSPC transplantation, animals received transfusion of 30x10 6 /kg cryopreserved iCD34 + cells tagged with eGFP or tdTomato from homozygous MHC-matched iPSCs (group 2) or homozygous MHC mismatched iPSCs (group 3). We have demonstrated that infusion of iHPs is safe and well tolerated. No teratoma or tumor formation was observed in animals one year after infusion of iHPs. Although we detected few iPSC derived hematopoietic cells in the blood within 1-week post-infusion, we did not see any significant differences in blood counts or other peripheral blood parameters between all animal groups. Intriguingly we found footprints of iPSC-derived cells in the colon, lymph node, skin and brain specimens collected 25 days after iHP infusion from one animal. This suggests a possibility of migration and retention within these tissues of iHP and iHP-derived myeloid cells. To assess immunogenicity, MHC homozygous iHPs were infused into immunocompetent MCMs across different MHC barriers. 10x10 6 /kg of cryopreserved iCD34+ from homozygous iPSCs were transfused every week for 3 weeks, into animals that were divided into 4 groups namely autologous (group I), MHC matched homozygous (group II), MHC matched heterozygous (group III) and MHC mismatch (group IV). Overall, these studies revealed low immunogenicity of MHC homozygous iHPs in MHC matched homozygous and heterozygous animals, while weak immune response was detected following iHP infusion in some MHC mismatched animals.
