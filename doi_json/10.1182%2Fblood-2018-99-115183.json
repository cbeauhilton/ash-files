    "abstract_text": "Background: MDM2, a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor p53, is overexpressed in several cancers including hematological malignancies. Disrupting the MDM2-p53 interaction represents an attractive approach to treat cancers expressing wild-type functional p53. Anticancer activity of small molecule MDM2 inhibitor milademetan (DS-3032b) has been demonstrated in preclinical studies and in a phase 1 trial in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome. Quizartinib is a highly selective and potent FLT3 inhibitor that has demonstrated single-agent activity and improvement in overall survival in a phase 3 clinical study in relapsed/refractory AML with FLT3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutations. We present here the preclinical studies exploring the rationale and molecular basis for the combination of quizartinib and milademetan for the treatment of FLT3-ITD mutant/TP53 wild-type AML. Methods: We investigated the effect of quizartinib and milademetan combination on cell viability and apoptosis in established AML cell lines, including MV-4-11, MOLM-13 and MOLM-14, which harbor FLT3-ITD mutations and wild type TP53. Cells were treated with quizartinib and milademetan at specified concentrations; cell viability and caspase activation were determined by chemiluminescent assays, and annexin V positive fractions were determined by flow cytometry. We further investigated the effect of the combination of quizartinib and the murine specific MDM2 inhibitor DS-5272 in murine leukemia cell lines Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD, Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD+F691L and Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD+D835Y, which harbor FLT3-ITD, ITD plus F691L and ITD plus D835Y mutations, respectively. F691L or D835Y mutations are associated with resistance to FLT3-targeted AML therapy. In vivo efficacy of combination treatment was investigated in subcutaneous and intravenous xenograft models generated in male NOD/SCID mice inoculated with MOLM-13 and MV-4-11 human AML cells. Results: Combination treatment with milademetan (or DS-5272) and quizartinib demonstrated synergistic anti-leukemic activity compared to the respective single-agent treatments in FLT3 mutated and TP53 wild type cells. Combination indices (CIs) were 0.25 \u00b1 0.06, 0.61 \u00b1 0.03, 0.62 \u00b1 0.06, 0.29 \u00b1 0.004 and 0.50 \u00b1 0.03, respectively, in MV-4-11, MOLM-13, MOLM-14, Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD+F691L and D835Y cell lines, all of which harbor FLT3-ITD or ITD plus TKD point mutations. The combination regimen triggered synergistic pro-apoptotic effect in a p53-dependent manner as shown by annexin-V staining and caspase 3/7 assays. Mechanistically, the combination treatment resulted in significant suppression of phospho-FLT3, phospho-ERK and phospho-AKT and anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family proteins (eg, Mcl-1), as well as up-regulation of p53, p21 and pro-apoptotic protein PUMA, compared to single agent treatments. Of note, the combination regimen also exerted a synergistic pro-apoptotic effect on venetoclax (BCL-2 inhibitor)-resistant MOLM-13 cells (CI: 0.39 \u00b1 0.04) through profound suppression of Mcl-1. In an in vivo study using the MOLM-13 subcutaneous mouse xenograft model, quizartinib at 0.5 and 1 mg/kg and milademetan at 25 and 50 mg/kg demonstrated a significant tumor growth inhibition compared with vehicle treatment or respective single-agent treatments. In MV-4-11 intravenous mouse xenograft model, the combination of quizartinib plus milademetan showed a significantly prolonged survival, with no animal death in the combination group during the study period, compared to respective single agent treatments and untreated control (Figure). Conclusion: Synergistic anti-leukemic activity was observed for quizartinib plus milademetan combination treatment in preclinical AML models. A phase I clinical trial of quizartinib/milademetan combination therapy in patients with FLT3-ITD mutant AML is underway. Figure.
