    "abstract_text": "A total of 551 pts with newly diagnosed CML-CP received imatinib (IM) 400 mg orally once daily as part of the IRIS study (O\u2019Brien et al, NEJM 2003). We now summarize the correlation of clinical responses with the steady-state trough plasma concentrations (Cmin) of IM and its major active metabolite CGP74588 . Cmin is a reflection of IM clearance and metabolism in CML pts. Trough PK samples (24 hrs post dose) were obtained in IM pts at Day 1 and steady state (Day 29). The plasma concentrations of IM and CGP74588 were determined by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Estimated rates of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR - 0% Ph+) and major molecular response (MMR - \u2265 3 log reduction in BCR-ABL/BCR ratio from a standardized baseline value for untreated pts) were given for the lower and upper quartiles (below Q1=25 th percentile, above Q3=75 th percentile) and the inter-quartile range of PK trough levels. After 4 weeks of IM at 400 mg, the overall mean (\u00b1SD, CV%) steady-state trough levels (Cmin) for IM and CGP74588 (n=351 pts) were 979 (\u00b1530, 54.1%) and 242 (\u00b1106, 43.6%) ng/mL, respectively. Median (Q1\u2013Q3, min-max) values (in ng/mL) were 879 (647\u20131170, 153\u20133910) for IM and 223 (169\u2013291, 50\u2013841) for CGP74588 . Times to CCyR and MMR within CCyR pts were significantly different between the three groups of IM plasma exposure (low/intermediate/high; p<0.025). The same was observed for CGP74588 , since the parent drug and metabolite levels were highly correlated (0.77, Spearman correlation coefficient). Overall, Cmin of IM was statistically significantly higher in pts who achieved CCyR (1009\u00b1544 ng/mL vs. 812\u00b1409 ng/mL, p=0.0116). The estimated MMR rate among all pts was significantly lower in pts with low IM levels: only an estimated 59%x43%=25% of all pts with IM levels <647 ng/mL achieved a MMR at 1 year (yr), compared to 40% of all other pts. By 4 yrs an estimated 53% achieved MMR despite low steady state Cmin levels compared with 80% for pts with high Cmin (and 72% for pts within inter-quartile range).

Although all CML-CP pts had received 400 mg qd IM, CCyR and MMR rates at 1 to 4 yrs were depending on their IM trough level (24 hrs after the last dose) after 4 weeks of IM. Similar results were observed for the major active metabolite of IM. These results suggest that achieving and maintaining an adequate plasma concentration of IM is important for a good clinical response, and that therapeutic drug monitoring could be done by measuring trough levels at steady state conditions."
