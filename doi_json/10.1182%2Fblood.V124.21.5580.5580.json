    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Myelofibrosis ( MF) is a clonal disorder associated mainly with JAK2V617F and MPL mutations. Recently, a new mutation in the gene encoding calreticulin (CALR) was discovered in the majority of JAK2/MPL negative patients. MF is burdened by a high rate of potentially life-threatening infections. The issue of recurrent and opportunistic infections is increased after the introduction in clinical practice of JAK inhibitors with immunosuppressive activity. However, the role of crucial immune cell subsets is still poorly characterized. Here, we investigated the phenotype/function of selected immune cells in MF. Specifically, we focused on circulating regulatory (Tregs) and IL-17-producing T cells (Th17 cells), monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs). Monocyte-derived DCs were also characterized. Methods: We characterized circulating Th17 cells, Tregs, monocytes and DCs of 17 untreated MF patients and 8 healthy controls (HC) by flow cytometry. Th17 cells were identified as CD4 + CD161 + CD196 + cells while Tregs were enumerated as CD4 + CD25 high CD127 low T cells. We also tested the in vitro suppressive activity of circulating CD4 + CD25 + Tregs with a mixed leukocyte reaction assay. Two subpopulations of circulating DCs, myeloid CD11c + and plasmacytoid CD123 + cells, were enumerated as well. In addition, after immunomagnetic selection, we tested both phenotype of circulating monocytes and their capacity to differentiate into CD14-derived immature and mature DCs, using a specific cytokines cocktail. JAK2V617F and MPL mutations were detected with RT-PCR while the presence of CALR mutations were tested with Exon 9 Next Generation Sequencing assay. Results: JAK2V617F (11 cases), MPL (3 cases), and CARL (3 cases) mutations were detected. We found that circulating CD4 + CD25 high CD127 low Tregs were reduced in MF patients as compared with healthy controls (p=0.043) , although their suppressive ability was maintained. We also found a lower number of circulating Th17 cells (p=0.0026) in MF patients. This finding was particularly evident in JAK2V617F + (p=0.008) and CARL + (p=0.03) patients. Despite their number was in the normal range, circulating monocytes from MF patients showed reduced expression of the CD86 co-stimulatory molecule. Moreover, as compared with the normal counterparts, immature monocytes-derived DCs from patients maintained low CD14 expression without upregulating the CD80 co-stimulatory molecule expression ( p=0.0063 ). Interestingly, at variance with plasmacytoid DCs, a reduced number of circulating myeloid DCs was observed in MF patients as compared with that of HC (p=0.01 ). Conclusions: Here we demonstrated that specific crucial subsets of immune cells show quantitative and/or qualitative abnormalities in MF patients. These findings may be useful to better understand the increased susceptibility of these patients to infections, since Th17 cells play a role in bacterial and fungal infections while myeloid DCs regulate Th1 activity. Of note, DCs inhibition might result in increased propensity to infections and compromised immune response to cancer.In addition, since monocytes are DC precursors, alterations in their differentiation pathway may contribute to develop defective immune responses.
