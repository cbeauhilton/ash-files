    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2224 Poster Board II-201 Although acyclovir (ACV)-resistant herpes simplex virus (HSV) occurs in healthy patients, higher rates have been reported in 7-27% of immunocompromised patients, particularly in the setting of acyclovir prophylaxis. Infection due to ACV-resistant HSV (ACV-R HSV) is frequently severe and poses challenges to treatment, particularly following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Unfortunately, currently available alternative therapies including foscarnet, cidofovir, and ganciclovir are frequently limited by their toxicity profile. We present a series of five HCT patients from 1997-2008 with severe infections due to ACV-R HSV who were successfully treated with continuous infusion of high dose acyclovir. A Pubmed search of published literature from 1948-2009 confirmed this as the first report of ACV-R HSV in HCT patients treated with this regimen. The characteristics of the patients are summarized in the table . Patients ranged in age from 24 to 55 and had undergone an allogeneic HCT following a myeloablative preparative regimen. All grafts were composed of peripheral blood hematopoietic cells. Underlying diseases included acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and essential thrombocytosis. Four of the five patients were receiving treatment for GVHD of the skin (grades 2-4), with regimens that included varying doses of prednisone. Infection was due to HSV-1 in three patients and HSV-2 in two. In vitro testing revealed that high median inhibitory concentrations were necessary to inhibit viral replication by 50% (MIC50) for all five isolates consistent with resistance to acyclovir, ganciclovir, and foscarnet. Failed HSV treatment regimens included standard, intermittent doses of acyclovir (5-10 mg/kg IV every eight hours), foscarnet, cidofovir, and/or famciclovir. Adverse reactions to these agents included severe renal insufficiency, hyponatremia, and neutropenia. The doses of ACV administered via continuous infusion ranged from 30 to 50 mg/kg per day, and time to resolution of lesions ranged from 1 week to 2 months. No patients experienced toxicity associated with continuous infusion of high dose acyclovir and therapy could be continued as an outpatient when appropriate.  Age, sex . Disease . HCT Type .

At this time it is not clear how the altered pharmacokinetics that results from continuous infusion of high doses of acyclovir overcomes viral resistance. We are currently investigating the mechanisms by which the sustained levels of ACV provide this therapeutic advantage. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
