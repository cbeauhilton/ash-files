    "abstract_text": "A stepwise approach which combined genome wide expression profiling and a TaqMan realtime PCR based screening was used to identify new markers for the monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Leukemic cells from 52 children with AML were analyzed. Seven genes were identified which are vastly over-expressed in many patients with AML compared to healthy bone marrow: CCL23, GAGED2, MSLN, SPAG6, and ST18 as well as the previously described markers WT1 and PRAME. This set of genes was analyzed in 141 follow-up samples from 25 patients. The expression of all genes decreased to normal levels in patients who achieved a continuous complete remission. Elevated levels of MRD markers were found prior to relapse in 7 out of 10 patients who relapsed. This set of genes should allow a sensitive and specific monitoring of MRD in AML. Notably, some of these markers could also serve as therapeutic targets or might be involved in leukemogenesis. MSLN is already used as a target for immunotherapy in clinical trials in other malignancies. GAGED2 and SPAG6 belong to the family of cancer testis genes which are also studied intensively as targets for immunotherapy. ST18 is a recently discovered tumor suppressor which was not yet described in hematological malignancies. CCL23 is a chemokine that inhibits the proliferation of healthy hematological stem cells.
