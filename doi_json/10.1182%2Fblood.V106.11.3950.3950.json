    "abstract_text": "Tarvacin\u2122 is a chimeric anti-PS antibody that is currently in Phase I clinical trials in cancer patients. It acts by targeting PS that becomes exposed on vascular endothelium in tumors in response to oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment. Tarvacin\u2122 recognizes a complex of PS and the PS-binding protein, \u03b22 glycoprotein I. Host leukocytes are induced to bind to the complex in tumor vessels and destroy tumor vessels by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxity. However, antibodies directed against PS-associated proteins are also known to elicit anti-phospholipid syndromes (APS). Anti-PS antibodies possibly cause APS by displacing anticoagulant proteins from PS on activated cell or by enhancing the binding of prothrombin; another explanation might be a direct activation of endothelial cells and platelets. The aim of the study was to determine whether Tarvacin \u2122 induces or interferes with platelet activation caused by ADP, collagen type I or calcimycin in vitro. Blood was drawn from 3 healthy volunteers, aged 31\u201354, who have not taken any antiplatelet medication for 14 days prior to the study. Dual channel whole blood aggregometer (Chronolog, Havertown, PA, USA) was employed for platelet aggregation studies in whole blood (WB/impedance method) and platelet rich plasma (PRP/optical method). Platelet count in PRP was adjusted to 200 K/\u03bcL. Platelet agonists (PS exposure triggers) used in the experiments were as follows: collagen (0.5, 1, 2 \u03bcg/mL), ADP (1.25, 2.5, 5, 10 \u03bcM), Calcimycin (10, 20, 30 \u03bcM) and Calcium ions (1, 2 mmol/L). Tarvacin\u2122 was provided by Peregrine Pharmaceuticals Inc, Tustin, CA. The Anti-CD 20 antibody, Rituxan \u2122 and physiologic saline were used as controls. Specimens (WB diluted with saline in 1:1 ratio or PRP) with the addition of Tarvacin\u2122 (100 \u03bcg/mL) or Rituxan \u2122 (100 \u03bcg/mL) or saline were first incubated on a gentle mixer for 10 minutes; incubation was then continued at 37 \u00b0 in the aggregometer well for another 5 minutes. Agonist-induced platelet aggregation was subsequently examined. Platelet aggregation studies in both WB and PRP showed that Tarvacin\u2122 neither induced platelet activation, nor inhibited platelet activation in response to ADP, collagen or calcimycin in vitro. In conclusion , Tarvacin\u2122 does not affect platelet function in the present in vitro assays. Possibly, the epitope on the PS -\u03b22 glycoprotein I complex does not orientate the antibody in a manner that interferes with platelet activation. Alternatively, activated endothelial cells or other factors may be critical to support platelet activation.",
