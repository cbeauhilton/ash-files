    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2085 Introduction. Although advanced patient age is commonly used as a factor in selecting therapy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), based on presumed associations with functional status, limited data exist regarding the relationships between age and physical, emotional, social, and functional well being. We examined the relationships between age and these domains of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for CLL patients treated in US community practices. Methods. Baseline data were collected as part of Connect CLL\u00ae, a prospective observational registry initiated in March 2010 involving centers in the US. Data on patient demographics and clinical characteristics were provided by clinicians. HRQOL was self-reported by patients in the clinic at enrollment. Patients completed 3 psychometrically validated instruments: the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), EQ-5D, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia (FACT-Leu). Standard analyses were conducted of each instrument given clinical characteristics at that time. Reported mean BFI, EQ-5D and FACT-Leu scores were analyzed by age group (74). Statistical significance of score differences among sub-cohorts was ascertained by ANOVA using SAS 9.1. Results. Baseline HRQOL data were reported by 604 patients, enrolled from 161 centers. Patients were predominantly male (62%) and white (90%) with mean age at 69.9 (standard deviation [SD] 11.2) yrs. HRQOL scores by age group are presented:  Baseline HRQOL by Age Group . . . . .

Anxiety/depression and self care are EQ-5D domains that also did not vary by age. Although mobility was most impaired in the oldest age group compared to the two younger groups, usual activities and pain/discomfort were worse in both the younger and older cohorts compared to those 65\u201374 years of age. FACT-Leu results indicated that the social/family domain scores did not vary by age, but that physical, emotional, and functional domains did vary statistically with the oldest typically doing better than the 65\u201374 year olds, but not necessarily better than those <65. Conclusions. Initial results from the Connect CLL\u00ae Registry indicate that HRQOL does not worsen monotonically with older age. In this cohort, both the youngest and oldest age groups had worse HRQOL in certain domains, presenting an inverted v-shaped relationship. Future analyses should be conducted on: (1) how HRQOL may be affected over time with changes in disease; and, (2) how HRQOL may be influenced by alternative therapies. Results reported here should serve as a useful baseline reference. Disclosures: Pashos: Celgene: Membership on an entity's Board of Directors or advisory committees.
