    "abstract_text": "Abstract 14 Several studies found that in patients with severe congenital neutropenia (CN) harboring mutations in the ELANE gene mutated NE protein induced unfolded protein response (UPR) leading to elevated apoptosis and diminished differentiation of myeloid cells. However, it is unclear, why UPR was not detected in patients with cyclic neutropenia (CyN) carrying the same ELANE mutations, which have been found in CN patients. Several UPR components have been identified in mammalian cells, which include three transducers (IRE1, PERK, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF-6) as well as one master regulator (BiP/GRP78). BiP is known to be regulated by ATF6. The activation of ATF6 and its target genes (GADD34, CHOP and BiP) in CN patients has not been studied yet. We were able to detect significantly elevated levels of ATF6 and BiP in myeloid cells of CN patients with ELANE mutations, in comparison to CyN patients and to healthy individuals. Therefore, we investigated the mechanism of UPR and activation of ATF6 and ATF6 target genes in CN patients in comparison to CyN patients. We transduced the myeloid cell lines HL60 and NB4 with lentiviral constructs contained either wild type (WT) ELANE cDNA, or mutated (MUT) ELANE cDNA and measured mRNA and protein expression of ATF6 as well as mRNA expression of ATF6 target genes. We compared the effects of three ELANE mutations: C42R, V145-C152del (both mutations presented in CN patients, but not in CyN patients) and S97L (typical for CN and CyN patients) with WT ELANE. We found that in both cell lines only C42R ELANE MUT, but not V145-C152del ELANE MUT or S97L ELANE MUT induced expression of ATF6, GADD34, CHOP and BiP, as compared to control transduced cells. Furthermore, we hypothesize that degradation of mutated NE protein by Secretory Leukocyte Protease Inhibitor (SLPI) might be involved in UPR induction. However, we detected only very low levels of SLPI mRNA in CD33 + myeloid cells and in PMNs of patients with severe congenital neutropenia (CN), as compared to patients with cyclic neutropenia (CyN) and to healthy individuals. The lack of the NE inhibitor, SLPI in CN patients may further contribute to elevated UPR triggered by ELANE MUT and normal levels of SLPI in CyN patients might protect from ELANE MUT-induced UPR. Indeed, inhibition of SLPI using SLPI-specific shRNA led to a significantly elevated expression levels of ATF6, GADD34 and BIP, as compared to ctrl shRNA transduced cells. More importantly, co-transduction of NB4 cells with SLPI shRNA in combination with ELANE S97L MUT (which is common for both CN and CyN patients), but not with WT ELANE led to elevated levels of ATF6, GADD34 and BIP. In summary, different ELANE mutations have different effects on UPR as judged by ATF6 activation and the level of ELANE-triggered UPR is regulated by SLPI.
