    "abstract_text": "Background: Cardiac and vascular toxicities are known complications on Bruton Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi)drugs. Ibrutinib, acalibrutinib and zanubrutinib are all approved BTKi drugs. We did a retrospective analysis on adverse effects (AE) of BTKi's that has been made available to public by the FDA. Methods: The FDA has made the data on AEs of various treatments available to general public through the FDA Adverse Events Reports System (FAERS) public dashboard. We investigated the infectious, cardiac and vascular AEs of various BTKi for the years 2019-2021. Results: The percentage of cardiac AE compared to total AEs reported for ibrutinib, acalibrutinib and zanubrutinib were 12%, 7.3% and 6.2% respectively. The most common cardiac toxicity was atrial fibrillation. The percentage of vascular AE compared to total AEs reported for ibrutinib, acalibrutinib and zanubrutinib were 8.2 %, 5.2 % and 3.9 % respectively. The most common vascular toxicity was hemorrhage. The percentage of infectious AE compared to total AEs reported for ibrutinib, acalibrutinib and zanubrutinib were 18.3%, 13.6% and 35.5% respectively. The most common vascular toxicity was pneumonia. Conclusions: Out of the reported cases of AEs to BTKis approved, ibrutinib have most and acalibrutinib have least cardiac AEs. Zanubrutinib has least vascular AEs. Out of the reported cases of AEs to BTKis approved, zanubrutinib have most infectious AEs. Disclosures Master:  Blue Bird Bio: Current holder of individual stocks in a privately-held company.",
