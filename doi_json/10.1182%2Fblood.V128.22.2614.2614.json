    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The use of Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) for the prevention and treatment of Venous Thromboembolic Disease (VTE) is increasingly common. Patients on longstanding anticoagulation for the prevention of VTE frequently undergo invasive procedures that necessitate interruption of anticoagulation in order to avoid excessive bleeding during the procedure. There is little evidence surrounding the safety of perioperative DOAC interruption in patients with VTE. Methods: This study represents a retrospective analysis of adult patients on DOAC therapy for prior VTE, who underwent temporary interruption of anticoagulation therapy for inpatient or outpatient invasive procedures. The timing to hold and resume DOAC anticoagulation was based on the estimated half-life of the DOAC, as well as the bleeding risk of the procedure (Standard vs High). Our primary outcomes included the 30-day thromboembolic complication rate, as well as the 30-day major bleeding rate (ISTH non-surgical and surgical major bleeding criteria). Secondary outcomes included clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) and overall mortality. Results: To date, a total of 87 patients have been included in the analysis, 68% of which were male. The mean age of the cohort was 58.3 years. All patients were on DOAC anticoagulation for acute treatment or secondary prevention of recurrent VTE. A large majority of patients (94%) were anticoagulated with rivaroxaban. Procedures were performed on an inpatient or outpatient basis in 24 and 63 patients, respectively. Forty six patients underwent procedures with standard bleeding risk. Mean time to anticoagulation discontinuation for standard and high bleeding risk procedures was 41.3 (SD = 20.8) and 49.3 (SD = 17.7) hours, respectively. The 30-day thromboembolic complication rate was 1.2% (95% CI: 0.2 to 6.2%), whereas the 30-day major bleeding rate was 0% (95% CI: 0 to 4.2%). The rate of CRNMB was 3.5% (95% CI: 1.2 to 9.7%). Overall mortality was 0% (95% CI: 0 to 4.2%). Conclusion: The perioperative interruption of direct oral anticoagulation for invasive procedures in patients with prior VTE appears to be associated with a relatively low risk of major bleeding, as well as recurrent VTE. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the benefits and risks of perioperative interruption of direct oral anticoagulation in patients with prior VTE.
