    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5065 The Latium is a region of central Italy that counts approximatively 5.600.000 of residents. We reported herein a preliminary analysis of 1572 patients affected by MPN diagnosed in the last 20 years and treated in 9 of the Centers belonging to our group. Our centers are mainly located in Rome (7 centers) and neighboring districts (2 centers, Latina and Viterbo). The diagnosis was performed according to PVSG criteria until 2001 and then according to the WHO criteria: the majority of the patients underwent bone marrow biopsy. 218 patients were affected by primary myelofibrosis (PMF), 779 by Essential thrombocytemia (ET) and 575 by Policytemia Vera (PV). Epidemiological and clinical findings of all patients at diagnosis as well as thrombotic complications and evolution are reported in the table:  . ET (779 pts) . PV (575 pts) . PMF (218 pts) .

Many clinical findings in our unselected cohort of patients are similar to those reported in literature; in particular, thrombotic events were seen in about 13 \u2013 17% of patients, without any correlation with Jak-2 status in both pre-diagnosis and follow-up. However, 2 main differences were noted: a lower incidence of JAK-2 V617F mutation among our PV patients and a lower rate of evolution in myelofibrosis and AML among our ET and PV patients. Both these features warrant further insights to be fully elucidated. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
