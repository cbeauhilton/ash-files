Methods ICR mice were assigned randomly into four groups which were treated with normal saline, the dose of 300mg/kg, 600mg/kg and 1200mg/kg MNP-Fe 3 O 4 . The mice were killed when they were exposed by intragastric administration after 2 weeks. The ratios of spleen to body weight, lymphocyte transformation rate in spleen suspension, phagocytic index of macrophage in belly cavity were detected. Results The ratios of spleen to body weight in all experimental groups were not significantly difference in comparison to the control group(P>0. 05). The lymphocyte transformation rate in spleen suspension in experimental groups were all higher than that of the control group, especially in the media dose group(600mg/kg)(P < 0. 05). And the results of phagocytic index of macrophage in belly cavity indicated that though all experimental groups showed that they enhanced the phagocytic function of macrophage more than the control group, media dose group(600mg/kg) could increase the phagocytic index more than the other two experimental group(P < 0. 05). Conclusion It is concluded that suitable dose of MNP-Fe 3 O 4 supplement enhance cellular immune function and phagocytic funtion of macrophage of mice.
