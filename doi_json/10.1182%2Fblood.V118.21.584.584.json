    "abstract_text": "Abstract 584 The Human Germinal center Associated Lymphoma ( HGAL ) gene is exclusively expressed in germinal center (GC) B-lymphocytes and GC-derived lymphomas. In patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), HGAL expression identifies a subgroup of patients with biologically distinct tumors associated with improved survival. Our previous in vitro studies demonstrated that HGAL decreases spontaneous and chemoattractant-induced cell motility by activating the RhoA signaling pathway and by directly interacting and augmenting F-actin and myosin II binding. However, the major function of HGAL in GC lymphocytes remains largely unknown. Based on our previous observation of tyrosine phosphorylation of a modified ITAM motif in the HGAL by Lyn, we hypothesized that HGAL may be involved in B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Indeed, following BCR stimulation of two GCB-like lymphoma cell lines (Raji and VAL), we observed marked reduction of Syk, Btk and PLC \u03b3 phosphorylation upon knockdown of endogenous HGAL by specific but not control siRNAs. Concordantly, HGAL knockdown in BCR-stimulated Raji cells reduced Ca 2+ mobilization and decreased NFAT transcriptional activity as analyzed by a luciferase reporter assay. HGAL expression in the BCR-stimulated HBL1 lymphoma cell line (lacking endogenous HGAL protein) resulted in increased Syk, Btk and PLC \u03b3 phosphorylation. Syk plays a major role in coupling BCR activation to downstream effectors. Endogenous HGAL was detected in immunoprecipitates of endogenous Syk and vice versa . Nanoscope microscopy studies confirmed co-localization of HGAL and Syk proteins in cell membranes, which was enhanced following BCR stimulation. In BCR-stimulated cells, Syk kinase activity was markedly increased following addition of HGAL protein as measured by an in vitro Syk kinase activity assay. To comprehensively examine HGAL effects on immune system and BCR signaling, we generated a transgenic mouse model in which HGAL is expressed under the control of the mouse Ly-6E.1 promoter in Sca1 + hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors of C57BL/6 \u00d7 CBA mice. The Sca1-HGAL transgenic mice showed normal embryonic and post natal development, and at 8 weeks of age demonstrated normal lymphoid development without any significant changes in the major hematopoietic compartments (bone marrow (BM), spleen, thymus and peripheral lymph nodes) and in peripheral blood. They also exhibited normal GC development in response to a T-cell dependent antigen immunization. In contrast, at 12 months of age the Sca1-HGAL mice developed a decrease in BM immature B-cells at the expense of recirculating B-cells (B220 + IgD hi ) compared to the age-matched normal littermates, suggesting a defect in B-cell lymphopoiesis. All the Sca1-HGAL transgenic mice became ill from approximately 12 months of age and all died between 12 to 22 months of age with statistically shorter survival as compared to the wild type controls. Analysis of these animals showed massive splenomegaly with marked white pulp hyperplasia and presence of multiple, frequently contiguous nodules predominantly composed of polyclonal follicular (B220 + CD21 int CD23 hi ) B lymphocytes. Extra-lymphatic infiltration by similar B lymphocytes was observed in the liver, lungs and kidneys of Sca1-HGAL mice with advanced disease. IgG isotype titers in these animals tended to be higher than in the wild-type controls, reaching a statistically significant difference for the IgG1 isotype. Follicular hyperplasia in the Sca1-HGAL transgenic mice is likely attributable to increased RhoA activation and enhanced BCR signalling manifested by increased Syk phosphorylation, Ca 2+ mobilization and in vitro B cell proliferation following BCR stimulation, in agreement with similar data observed in human DLBCL cell lines expressing HGAL. Gene expression profiling of lymphoid tissues confirmed significantly enhanced BCR signalling and RhoA pathway activation in Sca1-HGAL transgenic mice, corresponding to similar pathway activation in human lymphoma cell lines over-expressing HGAL. Overall, our findings demonstrate that HGAL, specifically expressed in GC B cells, enhances responsiveness to antigens by stimulating Syk kinase activity that without appropriate regulation may lead to lymphoproliferation. Further studies are needed to examine the role of HGAL in the pathogenesis of GC-derived lymphomas. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
