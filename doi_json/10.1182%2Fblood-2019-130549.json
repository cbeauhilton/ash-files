    "abstract_text": "The discovery that thalidomide derivatives recruit the E3 ligase CRBN to induce neomorphic degradation of proteins critical for multiple myeloma (MM) cells stimulated the research into proteolysis-targeting chimeric compounds (PROTACs), led to development of several CRBN- or VHL-based PROTACs against various oncoproteins and put a new spotlight on the biology and therapeutic targeting of E3 ligases in human neoplasias. However, so far only a few of the ~600 known/presumed E3 ligases have been leveraged for generation of PROTACs. The mechanisms regulating the function of most E3 ligases have not been systematically examined. Because the function of an E3 ligase is considered essential for anti-tumor activity of its respective PROTACs, we applied CRISPR knock-out (KO) systems to identify candidate regulators of E3 ligase function, via characterizing the the network of genes which modulate MM cell responses to PROTACs. We thus performed genome-scale CRISPR-based gene editing (for loss-of-function, LOF) studies in MM.1S cells treated with PROTACs targeting BET bromodomain proteins through MDM2 (A1874), CRBN (dBET6) or VHL (ARV-771 or MZ-1) or targeting CDK9 through CRBN (Thal-SNS-032); and validated key hits with individual sgRNAs in different MM cell lines. The top individual LOF events conferring resistance to PROTACs did not involve a compensatory mechanism or \"work-around\" the loss of the respective oncoprotein, but were predominantly associated with LOF of the respective E3 ligase; or with LOF for genes with known or plausible role in regulating the respective E3 ligases. For instance, sgRNAs against members of the COP9 signalosome complex decreased MM cell responses to CRBN- and (to a lesser extent) VHL-, but not MDM2-based PROTACs. PROTACs leveraging different E3 ligases were regulated by different cullin ring ligase (CRL) complex members (e.g. CUL2 , RBX1 , TCEB1 , TCEB2 for VHL- vs. DDB1 for CRBN- vs. no CRL member for MDM2-based PROTACs) or E2 conjugating enzymes (UBE2R2 vs. UBE2G1 for VHL- vs. CRBN-based PROTACs). Collectively, these results suggest that MDM2 regulation is largely CRL- and COP9-signalosome independent; while VHL regulation is less COP9 signalosome-dependent compared to CRBN. These mechanistic differences suggest that PROTACs targeting the same oncoprotein through different E3 ligases should not be associated with cross-resistance, a result which we validated in experiments involving sequential administration of different PROTACs against BRD4/3/2. In turn, this observation implied that developing PROTACs that leverage a more extended spectrum of E3 ligases may facilitate sequential uses of existing and these new PROTACs to delay or prevent treatment resistance. Building on results of our genome-scale CRISPR essentiality screens, we examined the dependency landscape of known E3 ligases of MM (n=20 cell lines) and 500+ non-MM cell lines. CRBN is redundant for nearly all MM or non-MM cell lines tested, while most other E3 ligases leveraged for PROTACs (e.g. MDM2, BIRC2, DCAF15, DCAF16, RNF114) are essential for only modest or small subsets of human cancer cell lines, suggesting that resistance to respective PROTACs may readily emerge through LOF of these E3 ligases without major fitness cost to tumor cells. We thus sought to identify E3 ligases which are highly expressed in subsets of human tumor cell lines (at levels well above the large majority of normal tissues) and are major dependencies for these \"high expressor\" cell lines: we identified MDM2 as a major dependency for p53-wild-type cell lines (consistent with MDM2 role as E3 ligase for p53) and we validated this result by documenting the preferential activity of a MDM2-based PROTAC for BRD4/3/2 against p53 wild-type cells. We also identified other E3 ligases genes with well-known roles in tumor cell biology (e.g. members of anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome); as well as E3 ligases (e.g. KCMF1, RNF4) which, to our knowledge, have not been leveraged for design of PROTACs, but warrant consideration given their patterns of essentiality in \"high expressor\" tumor cells. Our study provides insights on differential regulation and distinct patterns of essentiality for different E3 ligases and informs the design of new PROTACs which leverage different E3 ligases to help delay/overcome treatment resistance in MM and beyond.
