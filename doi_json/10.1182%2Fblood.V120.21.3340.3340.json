    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3340 Bernard Soulier Syndrome (BSS) is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by a defect in the platelet glycoprotein (GP)Ib/IX complex. Platelet transfusion is the primary treatment for hemorrhage but is often limited because of the potential for provoking allo-immunization and refractoriness. We have previously shown that the macrothrombocytopenia and prolonged bleeding of murine BSS (GPIb\u03b1 null ) can be corrected by myeloablative total body irradiation (TBI) and transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) transduced with a lentivirus that expresses hGPIb\u03b1 under integrin \u03b1IIb promoter control (2bIb\u03b1LV). For application of this gene therapy approach to the treatment of human patients, it is important to minimize treatment-related adverse effects. In this study, we established a transgenic mouse that expresses hGPIb\u03b1 at levels similar to the average levels observed in 2bIb\u03b1LV transduced HSC recipients that can be used as a consistent source of bone marrow HSCs (hGPIb\u03b1 tg+ ). We undertook two approaches for evaluation of HSC transplantation using hGPIb\u03b1 tg+ mouse bone marrow (BM) cells; 1) determine the percentage of hGPIb\u03b1 tg+ HSCs necessary for therapeutic benefit and 2) determine if non-myeloablative strategies can achieve hGPIb\u03b1 expression levels sufficient to correct the bleeding phenotype of GPIb\u03b1 null mice. In order to determine the percentage of HSCs required to achieve therapeutic effects, mixed BM chimeras were generated by reconstituting lethally irradiated GPIb\u03b1 null mice with variable mixtures (5% - 100%) of BM cells isolated from hGPIb\u03b1 tg+ and GPIb\u03b1 null mice. Tail bleeding time assays performed after BM reconstitution demonstrated that 10% hGPIb\u03b1 tg+ BM mononuclear cells mixed with 90% GPIb\u03b1 null BM mononuclear cells were sufficient to correct the tail bleeding time (n=5). Platelet analysis showed that the bleeding phenotype was rescued in recipients having higher than 40 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcl of hGPIb\u03b1 tg+ platelets, which corresponds to 6.5% of wild type mouse platelet counts (630 \u00b1 57 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcl, n = 8). These results suggest therapeutic potential for non-myeloablative conditioning regimens for the treatment of murine BSS. Thus we next tested the transplantation of hGPIb\u03b1 tg+ mouse BM cells into GPIb\u03b1 null recipients conditioned with two non-myeloablative doses of busulfan (25 mg/kg on days -2 and -1). Analysis of platelets by flow cytometry showed that, as expected, the percentage of hGPIb\u03b1-positive platelets in busulfan-conditioned recipients was lower than those transplanted after lethal TBI conditioning (63.2% \u00b136.6%, n = 15 vs. 95.2% \u00b11.7%, n = 8). However, tail bleeding time assays showed that bleeding times of busulfan-conditioned recipients were corrected and not significantly different from lethally irradiated recipients (2.7 \u00b1 3.1 minutes, n = 15 vs 1.9 \u00b1 1.5 minutes, n = 8), while no untreated GPIb\u03b1 null mice (n=8) stopped bleeding within 10 minutes. Platelet counts were also significantly increased in busulfan-conditioned recipients compared to untreated GPIb\u03b1 null mice (381 \u00b1 132 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcl, n = 11 vs. 181 \u00b1 35 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcl, n = 11). Thus non-myeloablative doses of busulfan conditioning and transplantation of hGPIb\u03b1 tg+ mouse BM cells were shown to achieve relevant levels of engraftment in murine BSS with significantly corrected bleeding times and platelet counts. Antibody response to hGPIb\u03b1 and immune-mediated thrombocytopenia was documented in 3 of 15 recipient mice, suggesting immunogenicity of hGPIb\u03b1 transgene protein in GPIb\u03b1 null mice partially immunosuppressed with busulfan. However, immunotolerance was identified without treatment and antibody disappeared in all three mice 3 to 7 months after BM transplantation. In conclusion, non-myeloablative doses of busulfan conditioning may be a reasonable alternative to TBI for the BMT-based treatment of BSS and could be utilized in non-myeloablative autologous gene therapy in human BSS.
