    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Numerous strategies utilizing chemotherapy followed by filgrastim allow for the successful mobilization of peripheral hematopoietic progenitor cells. To eliminate the need for self-administration of multiple growth factor injections and to minimize cost, we piloted a mobilization strategy consisting of low-dose Pegfilgrastim and chemotherapy. Methods: Seven consecutive patients scheduled to undergo hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant for hematologic malignancy received a single 6mg injection of Pegfilgrastim 24\u201348 hours after chemotherapy. The targeted CD34+ collection was 5x10 6 cells/ kg. The number of apheresis, CD34+ cell yield, time to engraftment and toxicities were recorded. These patients were compared to the 15 previous patients who received Filgrastim and chemotherapy for mobilization. Results: In the pilot population, the median age was 60 (range: 39\u201367) years. Chemotherapy priming before Pegfilgrastin for three patients with multiple myeloma and two with stage IV mantle cell lymphoma was 4.5grams/m 2 of cyclophosphamide; one patient with relapsed, stage IV Hodgkin\u2019s disease received ICE and one multiple myeloma patient with a serum creatinine of 3.1mg/dL, received 2.5grams/m 2 of cyclophosphamide. Five patients required a single apheresis, two patients required two apheresis collections. The median CD34+ yield was 6.7 x10 6 /kg (range: 3.2\u201313.7). The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 10 days (range: 9\u201312). The median time from Pegfilgrastim to apheresis was 9 days (range: 7\u201310). The Pegfilgrastim cost per patient was $3,250.00. Toxicity was limited to grade II bone pain. The comparison group consisted of seven multiple myeloma, four leukemia and four lymphoma patients. Their median age was 51.5 years (range: 24\u201367). The median number of apheresis procedures was 2 (range: 1\u20133). The median CD34+ yield was 5.6 x10 6 /kg (range: 2.9\u201317.6). The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 11 days (range: 9\u201311). The median time from cytokine to apheresis was 8.5 days (range: 3\u201316). The median cost of Filgrastim per patient was $3,650.00 (range: $2,290\u2013$8,760). The median number of Filgrastim injections was 10 (range: 10\u201314). Toxicity was limited to grade II bone pain. Discussion: In a two cohorts of patients with hematologic malignancies Pegfilgrastim as compared to Filgrastim resulted in a decreased cytokine cost, a fewer number of apheresis collection procedures, a more predictable time to first apheresis and no self-administration of medication. There was no significant difference in the time to engraftment. Conclusion: Low-dose Pegfilgrastim in conjunction with chemotherapy results in as effective CD34+ progenitor cell mobilization with less drug cost and apheresis time as compared to Filgrastim with chemotherapy.",
