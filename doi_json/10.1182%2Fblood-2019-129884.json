    "abstract_text": "Background: The Hyper-CVAD regimen is safe and effective in the frontline treatment of B-ALL. The addition of rituximab to the Hyper-CVAD regimen (HCVAD-R) improved the 3-year overall survival (OS) to 60% in pts with B-ALL. Ofatumumab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that binds to the small extracellular loop of the CD20 molecule and has greater in vitro potency and increased complement-mediated cell lysis compared to rituximab. We hypothesized that ofatumumab plus Hyper-CVAD may increase the rates of complete remission (CR) and measurable residual disease negativity (MRD-) and improve survival by decreasing relapse rates. Methods: Pts were eligible if they had newly diagnosed untreated or minimally treated (\u2264 1 cycle) Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative CD20+ B-ALL. CD20 positivity was defined as \u2265 1% positive B-ALL cells. Pts received 8 alternating cycles of Hyper-CVAD and high-dose methotrexate/cytarabine (MTX/AraC). Ofatumumab was administered on days 1 and 11 of cycles 1 and 3; and days 1 and 8 of cycles 2 and 4. Pts then received POMP maintenance on cycles 1-5, 8-17 and 20-30 and late intensifications on cycles 6-7 and 18-19 (Hyper-CVAD + ofatumumab followed by MTX + peg-asparaginase). Pts received a total of 8 intrathecal injections of MTX and AraC for CNS prophylaxis. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival (RFS) and secondary endpoints include CR rates, MRD negativity rates and OS. On a subset of 27 patient samples, transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to identify translocations and RNA expression signature for Ph-like ALL. We also performed a comprehensive detection of fusions and mutations reported in Ph-like ALL on RNA from these 27 samples using a multiplex fusion and mutation detection assay (Archer\u00ae FusionPlex\u00ae ALL). Results: Between August 2011 and May 2017, 69 pts were enrolled, including 4 already in CR at baseline after receiving 1 cycle of chemotherapy. Pts characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The median age was 41 years (18-71) and 48% pts were in the adolescent and young adult (AYA) age category (18-39 year-old). 7 of the 27 pts (26%) who had RNA-seq had Ph-like ALL gene expression signature. Among the 7 pts; 5 had Ph-like ALL fusions identified by Archer and/or RNA-seq-based fusion detection, including 2 P2RY8-CRLF2 , 1 IGH-CRLF2 , 1 BCR-FGFR1 , and 1 ATF71P-PDGFRB . One patient had high CRLF2 expression with an unknown fusion partner. The remaining case lacked a fusion by either platform. Pts with Ph-like ALL had a higher median WBC of 41 x 10 9 /L (range, 2 - 184). 43 pts (62%) had CD20 expression on \u226520% of the leukemic cells. 10/44 tested pts (23%) had TP53 mutation and 10/37 (27%) had CRLF2 overexpression by flow cytometry (4/5 CRLF2 rearrangement confirmed by Archer). 4 pts (6%) had low-hypodiploidy / near triploidy (Ho-Tr) and 2 (3%) pts had complex karyotype (CK). All but 1 pt (98%) achieved CR (2 after 2 cycles); only 1 pt (2%) died during induction. The MRD- rate was 65% after cycle 1 and 93% overall. These rates were 14% and 71%, respectively for pts with Ph-like ALL. The median time to MRD- was 0.7 month (range, 0.4-8 months) overall and 3 months (range, 0.7-6.5 months) for pts with Ph-like ALL. A total of 13 pts (19%) underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation for adverse-risk cytogenetics (CK or Ho-Tr), Ph-like ALL (n=1/7), or persistent MRD+. The most common non-hematologic grade 3-4 toxicity was infection which occurred in 56% and 81% of pts, during induction and consolidation, respectively. With a median follow-up of 44 months, 46 pts (64%) are alive, including 37 pts (54%) in CR1. The median RFS and OS were 52 months (95% CI, 43 - NR) and not reached (95% CI, 65 - NR), respectively. The estimated 4-yr RFS and OS rates were 60% (95% CI, 49 - 73%) and 68% (95% CI, 58 - 81%), respectively (Figure 1A-1B). For AYA pts, the 4-yr OS rate was 74% (95% CI, 60 - 91%) (Figure 2A). The 4-yr OS rates were 54% (95%, 26 - 100%) for pts with Ph-like ALL compared to 74% (95% CI, 57 - 97%) for pts without Ph-like ALL (Figure 2B). There was no difference in OS according to the CD20 expression level (20% cut-off ; p = 0.31). Using historical control pts, there was a trend towards improved OS with HCVAD-O versus HCVAD-R for pts with CD20 \u2265 20% (4-yr OS rate 63% vs 49%, p = 0.16) and HCVAD-O versus HCVAD alone for pts with CD20 1-19% (4-yr OS rate 73% vs 62%, p = 0.46). Conclusion: HCVAD-O is a safe and highly effective regimen in pts with CD20+ Ph-negative B-ALL. This regimen achieves excellent outcomes in the AYA population.
