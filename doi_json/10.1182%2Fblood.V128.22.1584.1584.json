    "abstract_text": "Although improved treatment of pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) has become increasingly successful with cure rates of up to 90%, leukemia reoccurrence is clearly associated with inferior prognosis. Treatment failure and resistance in leukemias are considered to involve defects in apoptosis signaling, which forms the basis for apoptogenic treatment approaches such as the use of Bcl-2 inhibitors. Identification of alternative cell death programs like lysosomal membrane permeabilization-induced cell death may provide a novel strategy for the treatment of ALL. Previous studies showed that lysosomal activity, as well as their traffic properties are greatly altered during tumorigenesis. Intralysosomal hydrolases such as cathepsin B, L and D have been implicated in cancer progression and high expression levels are generally associated with poor prognosis. Lysosomotropic agents modulating lysosomal integrity may overcome cell death resistance and might therefore also improve the outcome of high risk or ALL relapse patients. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of the lysosomotropic compound B10, a derivative of Betulinic acid, as well as its combination with the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-263 in B-cell precursor- (BCP-) ALL. In BCP-ALL cell lines, B10 showed induction of cell death combined with increased DNA fragmentation. Interestingly, additional treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk only partially rescued B10 triggered loss of cell viability, indicating that B10 is not exclusively inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis, but also induces an additional alternative cell death program. B10 permeabilized lysosomes as indicated by the significant decrease of LysotrackerRED positive populations detected by flow cytometry, and treatment with E-64d, a potent inhibitor of thiol proteases and cathepsins, reduced B10-induced cell death, thus emphasizing the cathepsin-dependent effect of B10. To exclude that B10-induced lysosomal permeabilization might represent a secondary effect, a panel of different substances was tested for their activity on lysosomal membrane integrity. While treatment with dexamethasone, chloroquine, vincristine and asparaginase also showed lysosomal permeabilization, co-treatment with E-64d did not reduce cell death indicating a secondary effect of these compounds on lysosomes. In addition to cell lines, we tested the effect of B10 on 15 primary leukemia samples isolated from ALL bearing mice of established patient-derived NOD/SCID/hu BCP-ALL xenografts. In a majority of these individual patient-derived leukemias, B10 induced cell death that could be inhibited by E-64d, thus demonstrating a lysosomal protease-dependent death program also in primary ALL. In addition to its classical role in triggering the intrinsic mitochondria dependent apoptosis pathway, the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax was previously described to be involved in the regulation of lysosomal membrane integrity, pointing to a possible synergistic effect of B10 and BH3-mimetics. Intriguingly, in cell fractionation assays we observed increased Bax recruitment to lysosomal membranes when B10 is present. Interestingly, co-treatment with the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-263, which displaces Bcl-2 from its inhibitory binding to Bax, led to increased lysosomal permeabilization, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase activation indicating involvement of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. The importance of lysosomal Bax recruitment for the activity of ABT-263 and its concomitant effect on lysosomal membrane permeabilization was further supported by Bax knockdown experiments, since induction of lysosomal disruption, release of cathepsins and their subsequent effect on cell death activation by B10 was reduced. Taken together, our findings suggest an important role of lysosomal membrane permeabilization-induced cell death for the activity of Bcl-2 inhibitors such as ABT-263. The combination of BH3 mimetics with lysosomotropic compounds may provide the basis for novel molecular directed treatment strategies. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
