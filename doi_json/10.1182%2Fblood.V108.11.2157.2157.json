    "abstract_text": "Sokal and Hasford scores have been used to estimate the survival of CML patients following alkylator-based or interferon-based therapy, and may also predict the outcome of patients receiving first-line imatinib. These scores were designed for patient characteristics at the time of diagnosis and they have been assumed to have no clinical value at other times during the course of the disease (eg. second-line or subsequent therapy). We seek to determine the applicability of the Sokal and Hasford scores in predicting outcomes in patients receiving second or subsequent-line therapy with imatinib and other novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). This analysis is based on 379 CML patients in chronic phase (90%) or accelerated phase as defined by cytogenetic clonal evolution (10%), who were enrolled on clinical trials of imatinib following interferon failure (n=294), or nilotinib or dasatinib following imatinib failure (n=85). Significance of relationship between Sokal and Hasford risk categories and response were tested using the Chi-Square test, and differences in survival assessed using the log-rank method. P-values are summarised below:  . Imatinib following Interferon Failure . Nilotinib/Dasatinib Following Imatinib Failure . . Sokal . Hasford . Sokal . Hasford . *comparison between low and intermediate risk groups only Low Risk 219 (74%) 176 (60%) 39 (46%) 45 (53%) Intermediate Risk 65 (22%) 111 (38%) 34 (40%) 38 (45%) High Risk 10 (3%) 6 (2%) 12 (14%) 2 (2%) Any Cytogenetic Response p<0.001 p<0.001 p=0.01 p=NS Major Cytogenetic Response p<0.001 p<0.001 p=0.002 p=0.04* Complete Cytogenetic Response p<0.001 p<0.001 p=0.005 p=0.07* Survival p<0.0001 p<0.0001 Insuff Events Insuff Events .

Due to the low number of deaths (n=5) on the nilotinib and dasatinib trials, the effect of Sokal and Hasford scores on predicting survival could not be assessed but they remain predictive of cytogenetic response. We conclude that the Sokal and Hasford scores calculated at the time of therapy failure are useful predictors of subsequent response to salvage therapy with imatinib and other TKIs.",
