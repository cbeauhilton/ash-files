    "abstract_text": "Haemopoietic stem cell transplantation is a well-established treatment modality for \u03b2 thalassaemia. The challenge is to minimise graft failure due to the expanded haemopoietic compartment whilst reducing the risk VOD due to the effects of iron load. From 2011 to 2016 thirty-five consecutive sibling transplants were conditioned with fludarabine 160 mg/m 2 , treosulfan 42 g/m 2 , thiotepa 10 mg/kg and ATG (Thymoglobulin) 7.5 mg/kg (FTTA). Endogenous haemopoiesis was suppressed pre-transplantation with hypertransfusions for a minimum of 8 weeks. GvHD prophylaxis was provided with ciclosporin and MMF. The median age was 5 years (2 - 16). The source of stem cells was BM in 30 patients and mixed cord blood and BM in 5 patients. The median cell dose was 4.17 x10 8 TNC/kg (range 0.23 - 8.51, including patients having red cell depletion for major ABO incompatibility) and 7.28 x 10 6 CD34+/kg (range 2.05 - 14.43) for the patients receiving bone marrow only; 1.64 x 10 8 TNC/kg (range 1.22 - 3.9) and 4 x 1 0 6 CD34+/kg (range 2.06 - 8.79) for BM and 3.8 x 10 7 TNC/kg (range 0.8 - 7.32) and 0.53 x 10 6 CD34+/kg (range 0.06 - 1.8) for cord blood for the patients receiving a combination of cord blood and bone marrow. The median survival was 21.1 months (0.4-50.7). Patients were Pesaro class I or II (Pesaro class III patients were intensively chelated pre-transplantation to reduce the stage of fibrosis and return to class I or II). All patients were evaluated with liver biopsy pre-transplantation and defibrotide prophylaxis given if Ishak stage \u2265 3. All patients engrafted and achieved evidence of donor haemopoiesis on day +28, and all but one patient achieved transfusion-independence and donor haematological values. Two patients had secondary graft failure: one patient had progressive reduction of donor haemopoiesis with reestablishment of ineffective thalassaemic haemopoiesis and transfusion dependence on day +313, another patient had reestablishment of ineffective thalassaemic and myelodysplastic haemopoiesis with 7 deletion on day +532; both patients established normal haemopoiesis following a second BMT. There was one death (2.9%), on day +89 due to idiopathic pneumonia syndrome. Acute GvHD \u2265 grade 2 occurred in 4 patients (11.4%). Chronic limited GvHD occurred in 5 patients (14.3%) and extensive in 1 patient (2.9%). Chronic GvHD was only present at 18 months in one patient (2.9%). VOD occurred in 2 patients (5.7%, days +7 and +9 respectively) and responded to standard measures and defibrotide treatment. The median neutrophil engraftment was 11 days (range 9 to 21). The median platelet engraftment >20 x10 9 /L was 28 days (range 16 to 73) and >50 x10 9 /L was 32 days (range 19 to 73). The median time to cessation of immunosuppression was 160 days (105-309). Chimerism studies on day +28 demonstrated 97.1% in whole blood (WB) and 76.9% in T cells (T) >95%, 2.9% WB and 3.8% T >90-95%, 0% WB and 19.2% T >50-89%, and 0% WB and 4.8% T 95%, 3.1% WB and 13.3% T >90-95%, 12.5% WB and 23.3% T >50-89%, 3.1% WB and 6.7% T 95%, 33.3% WB and 19.2% T >90-95%, 11.1% WB and 38.5% T >50-89%, 7.4% WB and 0% T 95%, 8% WB and 20.8% T >90-95%, 16% WB and 20.8% T >50-89%, 20% WB and 16.7% T <50%. In conclusion, the 3 year's overall survival was 97.1% and the disease-free survival 89.2%. Hence, FTTA leads to early and sustained engraftment with low rate of graft failure, and minimal occurrence of VOD and IPS, whilst the incidence of GvHD is low, though there is a high rate of mixed chimerism, the large majority which is stable. Further improvements should focus on minimising unstable cases. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
