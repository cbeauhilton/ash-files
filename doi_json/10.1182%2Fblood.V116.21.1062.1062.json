    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1062 Background: Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) incur significant morbidity and mortality among neutropenic patients after chemotherapy. The risk for these infections is related to the intensity and duration of neutropenia, and varies from 2% to 40%. Mortality rates associated with documented IFIs are considerable, reportedly ranging from 30% to 60%. Empirical antifungal therapy is the standard care for neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies who remain febrile despite broad-spectrum antibacterial treatment. Several antifungal agents including voriconazole (VRCZ) or liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) have been studied as empirical therapy for febrile neutropenia (FN). However, limited data are available concerning the efficacy of micafungin (MCFG) in FN patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods: We conducted a randomized, cooperative group, open-label trial comparing MCFG (150 mg once daily) with VRCZ (6 mg/kg twice on day 1 followed by 4 mg/kg twice daily) as first-line empirical antifungal treatment for 95 hospitalized FN patients with AML during induction or consolidation chemotherapy (MCFG, 49; VRCZ, 46). The efficacy end point was a favorable overall response, as determined by a five-component end point according to the criteria of Walsh et al (N Engl J Med 2004; 351: 1391). Results: At the time of enrolment, there were no significant differences in the demographics or baseline characteristics between the two groups. The mean treatment duration for MCFG and VRCZ was 10 and 9 days, respectively. The efficacy rates of MCFG and VRCZ were not significantly different (37.8% vs. 32.4%). The rates of breakthrough fungal infections (proven, probable and possible IFIs), successful treatment of baseline fungal infections, survival 7 days after end of therapy, and resolution of fever during neutropenia were similar in the two groups. However, premature discontinuation of therapy occurred less often in the MCFG group than in the VRCZ group (32.4% vs. 55.9%, P=0.0457*). In safety evaluation, there were fewer adverse events in the MCFG group than in the VRCZ group (27.0% vs. 64.7%, P=0.0013*). *: Chi square test Conclusions: MCFG was as effective as VRCZ, and better tolerated than VRCZ as empirical antifungal therapy in FN patients with AML. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
