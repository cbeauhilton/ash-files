    "abstract_text": "Characterization of pathogenic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has led to development of promising targeted therapies, including FLT3 (FLT3i) and IDH1/2 inhibitors (IDHi), with several approved for use; midostaurin (MIDO), gilteritinib, enasidenib (ENA), and ivosidenib (IVO). A proportion of patients (pts) have concurrent FLT3 and IDH mutations at diagnosis or develop a second mutation during therapy. FLT3 mutations, in particular, are associated with poor response rates to IDHi therapy, and treatment-emergent FLT3 mutations also appear to confer therapeutic resistance to these agents. There is therefore growing interest to study combined therapies that target multiple pathways, but the clinical experience with combined IDHi and FLT3i therapy has not yet been reported. We performed a retrospective data collection and analysis at 5 institutions (Massachusetts General Hospital, University of Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins University, University of California San Francisco, and MD Anderson). Using de-identified information from institutional databases, pts treated with concurrent IDHi and FLT3i were identified. Collected data included demographic data, date of initial diagnosis, number of prior therapies, prior hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), prior targeted therapy, type of IDH and FLT3 mutation, concurrent mutations and cytogenetics, duration of concurrent therapy, therapy-related toxicity, best response, toxicities, and vital status. We identified 12 pts who received concurrent IDHi and FLT3i therapy, 11 of which had relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML. Median age was 57 (range 31-84) and 9 (75%) were male. 7 (58%) were Caucasian, 3 (25%) African American, and 2 (17%) Asian. All pts had intermediate-risk cytogenetics. IDH1 R132 mutations were detected in 3 (25%), and IDH2 R140 mutations in 9 (75%) pts. One IDH2 mutation arose at relapse. All pts had FLT3-ITD mutations, and for 3 (38%), this mutation was known to have emerged at relapse. Common concurrent mutations included DNMT3A (75%) and NPM1 (58%). Median number of prior lines of therapy was 2 (range 0-6), and 4 pts (33%) had underwent prior HCT. Six pts (50%) had received FLT3i monotherapy in a prior line of treatment; 4 sorafenib, 1 gilteritinib, 1 MIDO, and 1 with FF-10101 (one pt had 2 prior lines of FLT3i). Six pts were initiated on concurrent therapy in simultaneous fashion, and the remainder were sequential; 2 pts (17%) were on IDHi therapy to which the FLT3i was added, and 4 (33%) had been on FLT3i with subsequent IDHi addition. Four pts (33%) received concurrent gilteritinib and ENA, 3 (25%) received gilteritinib and IVO, 3 (25%) received sorafenib and ENA, and 2 (17%) MIDO and ENA. Three pts received hypomethylating therapy concurrent with combined FLT3i/IDHi therapy; 2 received azacitidine (AZA) with ENA/MIDO, and 1 received AZA with ENA/gilteritinib. Pts were on concurrent therapy for a median of 75 days (range 9-343). Two pts had rash attributable to sorafenib, leading to temporary treatment pause in one and discontinuation in the other. No other toxicities were thought to be related to concurrent treatment. Four pts (33%) achieved CR or CRi (2 CR, 2 CRi), all with persistence of molecular residual disease (MRD). The median duration of remission for these pts was 310 days (range 85-326), and 3 have since relapsed. One pt experienced MLFS, 1 had peripheral blast reduction and 1 had improvement in platelets. An additional pt had MRD(+) CR (by NPM1 PCR) on gilteritinib prior to addition of ENA, and then achieved MRD(-) CR with dual therapy. The 4 remaining pts did not respond to concurrent treatment. Two pts (17%) were effectively bridged to HCT following dual therapy. Five pts (42%) remain alive. In this retrospective analysis, a notable proportion of pts benefitted from concurrent FLT3i and IDHi therapy. Composite remission rate was 33%, and overall response rate (CR+CRi+MLFS) was 42% among a largely R/R patient cohort, the majority of whom had received IDHi or FLT3i monotherapy in a prior line of treatment. An additional pt in MRD(+) CR cleared MRD following concurrent treatment. Concurrent therapy appeared to be largely well-tolerated. These response rates are particularly intriguing, given the presence of FLT3/ITD mutations, alterations thought to confer resistance to IDHi monotherapy. Larger, prospective studies are needed to fully assess the promise of concurrent FLT3i and IDHi therapy in co-mutated pts with AML.
