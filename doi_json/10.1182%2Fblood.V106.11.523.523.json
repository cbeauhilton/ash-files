    "abstract_text": "The human \u03b1 globin cluster includes an embryonic gene \u03b6 and 2 fetal/adult genes (\u03b12 and \u03b11) arranged along the chromosome in the order in which they are expressed in development (5\u2032-\u03b6-pseudo\u03b6- \u03b1D- \u03b12-\u03b11-\ud835\udec9-3\u2032). Fully activated expression of these genes in erythroid cells depends on upstream regulatory elements of which HS-40, located 40kb upstream of the cluster, appears to exert the greatest effect. We have recently shown that during terminal differentiation, key transcription factors (GATA-2, GATA-1, NF-E2, SCL complex) sequentially bind the \u03b1 promoters and their regulatory elements and a domain of histone acetylation develops which eventually encompasses the entire \u03b1 globin cluster including the upstream regulatory sequences. \u03b1-thalassemia most frequently results from deletions or point mutations affecting the structural \u03b1 globin genes, but may also result from rare sporadic deletions which remove the upstream regulatory sequences. In a single family \u03b1 globin expression was silenced by a mutation which drives an anti-sense RNA through the \u03b1 gene. Alpha thalassemia may also result from inherited and acquired mutations in a trans-acting factor called ATRX. Over the past few years we have continued to screen for new mechanisms which lead to \u03b1 thalassemia and thereby elucidate new principles underlying the regulation of gene expression in hemopoiesis. Here we describe a new mechanism of \u03b1 thalassemia occurring in Pacific Islanders in whom we could detect no mutations or rearrangements in the \u03b1 globin gene locus. Despite this, extensive genetic analysis showed unequivocally that the causative mutation is linked to the terminal 169kb of chromosome 16 (Viprakasit et al accompanying abstract). Analysis of globin synthesis, steady state RNA levels and detection of RNA in situ demonstrated that the mutation downregulates \u03b1 globin transcription. To identify the mutation, we constructed a new BAC library from an affected homozygote, isolated and re-sequenced the candidate region and focussed further analysis on 8 SNPS within the \u03b1 globin cluster, one of which creates a new GATA-1 binding site (GACA>GATA). Using primary erythroblasts from normal individuals and patients with this form of thalassemia, together with interspecific hybrids containing either the normal or abnormal copy of chromosome 16, we have shown that this SNP creates a new binding site in vivo for GATA-1 and the SCL complex. Furthermore, the chromatin at this site becomes activated as judged by acetylation of histone H3 and H4 (H3ac2 and H4ac4) and methylation of histone H3 (H3K4me2). Based on these data we postulate that an active transcriptional complex binding this new GATA site created by the SNP-mutation, could distract the upstream regulatory regions, which normally interact with the \u03b1 globin promoter, and silence \u03b1 globin gene expression. This model thus represents a new example of \u03b1 globin gene down-regulation and a new mechanism by which gene expression can be perturbed during hemopoiesis.",
