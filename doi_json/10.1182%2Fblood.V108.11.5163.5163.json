    "abstract_text": "Objective: To study Effectiveness of GVHD and GVL of donor-derived NK cell of MHC haplotype-mismatched BMT in mice. Methods: CB6F 1 H-2b/d mice model of EL9611 (H-2 d ) erythroleukemia was developed by injection of EL9611 (H-2 d ) cells in tail vein, CB6F 1 H-2b/d mice as the recipient, and C 57 BL/6 H-2b mice as the donor. 70 CB6F 1 H-2b/d mice were randomly separated into 7 groups (10 mice per group). Control groups (4 groups): the first group was the one without treatment, the second one was simple-irradiation group, the third one was the Ara-c-treated group which Ara-c were injected into mice at 50mg/(kg\u00b7one)\u00d76d followed by infusion of EL9611(H-2 d ) 5 days, the fourth one was haplotype-mismatched GVHD-control group which bone marrow cells and spleen cells of C 57 BL/6 H-2b mice were injected into the mice after 4 hours irradiation. Experimental groups(2 groups): Irradiated 9Gy, mice were injected C 57 BL/6 H-2b NK cells(1\u00d710 6 ) and then BM cells after 4 hours in the first experimental group. After irradiation of 9Gy, mice were injected C 57 BL/6 H-2b NK cells(1\u00d710 6 ) and then BM cells and spleen cells after 4 hours secondly. The effect was assessed by blood routine test, survival time, body weight, and histopathology in the recipients. Results: [circ1]Life span: the survival time was (10.10\u00b10.88) days, (9.80\u00b10.92)days, (22.70\u00b13.23) days and (20.10\u00b11.73) days in the first, second, third and fifth control groups respectively, (30.10\u00b115.95) days in the fourth control group in which the survival time of 2 mice was more than 30 days. The survival time was (39.10\u00b118.11) days and (49.30\u00b117.24) days in the first and second experimental groups respectively. The survival time in 4 mice of the first experimental group was more than 30 days and 7 mice of the second experimental group. The survival time of the first of experimental group was much longer than that in the first, second, third and fifth control groups ( P <0.01). The survival time of the second experimental group was much longer than that in other groups ( P <0.05). [circ2]Histopathology change: It was observed that the liver and spleen were enlarged and destroyed in the mice died from leukemia by leukemia cells. [circ3]It was noted that chimerism of Y chromosome appeared in mice of experimental groups of long survival time. Conclusion: The findings provide that donor-derived NK cell has the ability of antileukemia and can reduce GVHD in C 57 BL/6 H-2b \u2192CB6F 1 H-2b/d of erythroleukemia mice (EL9611, H-2 d ).",
