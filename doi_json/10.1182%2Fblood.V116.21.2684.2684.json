    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2684 NLPHL accounts for 6.5% of all Hodgkin lymphoma cases in the West. It is characterized by a nodular or a nodular & diffuse proliferation of scattered large atypical CD20+ neoplastic B-cells referred to as lymphocyte predominant (LP) cells and typically associated with small lymphocytes mainly of B-cell type. Patients with NLPHL typically have an indolent clinical course but can frequently relapse. Progression to a higher grade lymphoma, notably T-cell/Histiocyte rich B-cell lymphoma (T/HRBCL) has been described in a relatively small number of cases. Because of its rarity, limited information is available about the role of non-neoplastic lymphocytes in NLPHL. Some studies suggest that NLPHL with T-cell rich background may behave differently than the conventional type with predominance of B-cells within the nodules. The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes of differential tumor microenvironment namely B-cell versus T-cell rich in patients with NLPHL. We document the clinicopathologic profiles of 29 patients with biopsy proven NLPHL, consisting of 22 male & 7 female, median age 26 years (range, 13\u201380 years). All patients had lymphoadenopathy & 2 cases showed extranodal involvement in addition to nodal disease. Two patients had a bulky mass, and three had stage 4 disease at presentation. The pathological diagnoses was reviewed and confirmed by an expert hematopathologist in all 29 cases. The LP cells in all cases had a prototypic immunophenotype of CD20+, CD79a+, PU.1+, Bcl-6+, CD15 \u2212 CD30 \u2212 & Fascin \u2212 . T/HRBCL was excluded as all cases demonstrated preservation of follicular dendritic meshwork by CD21 staining. The meshwork was expanded in 20 cases & in 9 cases it was partially disrupted evincing an irregular architectural pattern. Epstein-Barr Virus encoded RNA by in situ hybridization was negative in 8/8 cases tested. 27/29 patients received systemic multi-agent chemotherapy consisting of: doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbacin (ABVD), 24 patients; cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristin, and prednisone (CHOP), 2 patients; Rituximab + CHOP (R-CHOP), 1 patient. 9/29 (31%) cases underwent autologous stem cell transplant. One patient in stage 2A refused therapy and one patient (stage 3A) developed significantly decreased cardiac ejection fraction following initial 2 cycles of ABVD. Both of these cases did not have adequate follow-up information available. Results: Twelve of the 29 cases (42%) were designated as having T-cell rich background population, whereas 17 (58%) were considered as conventional variant with a vast predominance of non-neoplastic small lymphocytes being B-cells. A few of the cases seemed to show admixture of both B-cells & T-cells. Comparing T-cell rich & B-cell rich background NLPHL no significant differences were detected in clinical parameters: age, sex, and stage at presentation, absolute lymphocyte count, LDH & Hb. All 27 (100%) patients in this study responded to first-line treatment: 23 with complete response & 4 with partial response. 13/27 (48%) had relapse/s. Five cases had more than one relapses. No patient died within a clinical follow-up period ranging from 18 to 84 months. When the overall survival (OS) of T-cell rich NLPHL was compared with the conventional variant there was no statistical significance between the two groups (log rank p= 0.1206). However, comparison of relapse rate showed that cases with T-cell rich background had higher relapse rate as well as greater incidence of multiple relapses as compared to B-cell rich type of NLPHL even after adjusting for the type of treatment received (log rank p= 0.003). Moreover, 2/12 (17%) T-cell rich NLPHL cases showed transformation to a high grade lymphoma (both T/HRBCL) at the time of recurrence. These findings suggest that in NLPHL a tumor microenvironment rich in T-cells rather than B-cells is characterized by an unfavorable clinical course although OS appears to be similar. These cases perhaps represent a distinctive clinicopathologic variant within the framework of NLPHL. Lately, the term \u2018NLPHL with nodules resembling T/HRBCL\u2019 has been used to express the immunobiological overlap between these two entities. It is possible that such cases could be regarded as \u201cintermediate lymphomas\u201d treading between NLPHL and T/HRLBCL. Further studies using gene array profiling analysis may help clarify the molecular differences between these closely related entities. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
