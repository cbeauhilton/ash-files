    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) is an antibody drug conjugate targeting CD22 antigen linked to N-acetyl-g-calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide, a potent cytotoxic antibiotic that induces double strand DNA breaks. The pharmacokinetics of InO has been characterized in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The primary objective of this analysis was to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of InO in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment. Methods: The effects of renal and hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of InO clearance (CL) were evaluated in adult patients with relapsed or refractory ALL (n=234) following administration of 1.2-1.8 mg/m 2 fractionated over 2 or 3 doses given weekly. For assessment of renal function, patients were stratified into 5 subgroups using baseline creatinine clearance (BCrCL): normal (\u226590 mL/min), mild (60-89 mL/min), moderate (30-59 mL/min), severe (15-29 mL/min), and end-stage renal disease (<15 mL/min). For assessment of hepatic impairment, patients were stratified into 5 subgoups per criteria from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Organ Dysfunction Working Group (ODWG), which categorizes impairment based on baseline total bilirubin (TB) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST): normal (TB and AST \u2264 upper limit of normal [ULN]), mild B1 (TB \u2264 ULN and AST > ULN), mild B2 (TB >1-1.5 x ULN, any AST), moderate (TB >1.5-3 x ULN, any AST), and severe (TB >3 x ULN, any AST). Data from adult patients with relapsed or refractory ALL (n=161) who received InO at a starting fractionated dose of 1.8 mg/m 2 were used to evaluate the safety of InO in patients with some degree of renal and/or hepatic dysfunction. For each of the renal function and NCI ODWG hepatic impairment subgroups, the percentage of patients exhibiting Grade \u22653 for any adverse events and Grade \u22653 hepatoxicity adverse event, respectively, was reported. Severity of hepatoxicity was determined through standardized search criteria with Standard Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities queries (cholestasis and jaundice of hepatic origin; hepatic failure, fibrosis and cirrhosis, and other liver damage-related conditions; hepatitis, noninfectious; and liver-related investigations, signs, and symptoms) and preferred terms (veno-occlusive liver disease or veno-occlusive disease; hepatic vein occlusion or thrombosis; portal vein thrombosis; Budd-Chiari syndrome; chronic graft versus host disease in liver; and acute graft versus host disease in liver). Results: For renal impairment, the median InO CL was 0.0394, 0.0403, 0.0308, and 0.0273 L/h, respectively, in individuals with normal ( n =184), mild (n=32), moderate ( n =17), and severe renal impairment (n=1). There were no patients with end-stage renal disease. Grade \u22653 adverse events were reported in 91.7% of patients with normal, 81.8% with mild, 100% with moderate, and 0% with severe or end-stage renal disease renal impairment. For hepatic impairment, the median InO clearance was 0.0363, 0.0520, 0.0382, and 0.0238 L/h, respectively, in individuals with normal ( n =167), mild B1 (n=58), mild B2 (n=8), and moderate hepatic impairment (n=1). There were no patients with severe hepatic impairment. Hepatotoxicity Grade \u22653 adverse events were reported in 23.6% of patients with normal, 6.8% with mild B1, and 3.1% with mild B2 hepatic function; no such events occurred in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Conclusions : InO pharmacokinetics were not affected by renal or hepatic impairment status, and safety was similar regardless of renal and/or hepatic function. Therefore, no starting-dose adjustment is required for patients with relapsed or refractory ALL with pre-existing mild to severe renal dysfunction or mild hepatic impairment.
