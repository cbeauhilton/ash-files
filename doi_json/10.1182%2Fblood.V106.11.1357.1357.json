    "abstract_text": "Erythroid Kruppel-Like Factor (EKLF) is a zinc finger transcription factor which is essential for \u03b2-globin gene expression. Knockout mice die from anemia at E15, but restoration of globin chain imbalance does not rescue anemia or increase survival. Cell lines derived from EKLF null mice undergo proliferation arrest upon reactivation of a conditional EKLF-ER fusion protein, suggesting a role in cell cycle control. A transcriptional profiling experiment comparing the global gene expression in EKLF null and wild type fetal liver identified many differentially expressed genes, a number of which function in G1 and at the G1/S checkpoint of the cell cycle. The Cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor, p18, and the S phase transcription factor E2F4 were both found to be significantly down regulated in EKLF null mice and this result was confirmed by real-time PCR. Interestingly, E2F4 knockout mice have a similar phenotype to EKLF knockout mice. Bioinformatic searches of the p18 and E2F4 genes shows that each contains phylogenetically conserved CACC box motifs capable of binding EKLF within longer regions of conservation in promoter and intron regions. The p18 gene contains two conserved CACCC sites upstream of the start of transcription, which are required for EKLF dependent promoter activity in luciferase reporter assays. The transcription factor E2F4 contains a conserved EKLF-binding CACC site within an intron that is closely associated with two conserved GATA1 binding sites. We show by a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays that the E2F4 intron and p18 promoter are occupied by EKLF in vivo . Together, these results suggest that EKLF is likely to directly regulate expression of key cell cycle genes in vivo to drive the switch from proliferation to differentiation of erythrocytes. The loss of EKLF is likely to result in aberrant proliferation and predisposition to leukemia.",
