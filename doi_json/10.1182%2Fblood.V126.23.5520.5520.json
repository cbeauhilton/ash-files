    "abstract_text": "Objectives: To evaluate the influence of pretransplantation serum ferritin on children \u03b2-thalassemia major (\u03b2-TM) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 266 HLA-matched children with \u03b2-TM from January 2009 and November 2014 was performed. Transplantation conditioning regimen of these children was the NF-08-TM protocol. Median follow-up time was 28 months (3~62months). We observed the relationship between pretransplantation serum ferritin level and transplantation complications which included infection, graft versus host disease(GVHD),veno-occlusive disease(VOD) and death. Results: Transplantation-related death occurred in 18 of 266 patients (6.8%). Five-year overall survival (OS) was found to be 92.8%. Among various complications, only infection was significantly associated with the high serum ferritin level (t=-2.673, P=0.008), especially serum ferritin above 3449.5\u03bcg/L(P=0.000). Meanwhile infection was the most common complication and severe infection would be main cause of deaths. Conclusions: NF-08-TM conditioning regimen was the optimization for HLA-matched \u03b2-TM patients. High pretransplantation serum ferritin level would bring high infection occurrence.
