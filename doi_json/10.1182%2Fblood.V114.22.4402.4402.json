    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4402 Introduction Dysfunction in cellular and humoral immunity entails an increased risk of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). It has been suggested that innate immunity, especially natural killers cells play key role in antitumor cytotoxicity regulated by interaction between killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) on NK cells and some T-cell subpopulations and their HLA-class I ligands on target cells. KIRs receptors have been divided into two functional groups: with long cytoplasmic tails (DL) - inhibitory and with short cytoplasmic tails (DS) - activating. Two broad haplotypes of KIR genes have been defined: the A haplotype characterized by presence of single activating KIR gene ( 2DS4 ) and the B haloptype characterized by two or more activating KIR genes ( 2DS1, 2DS2, 2DS3, 2DS5 and 3DS1 ).The 2DL2, 2DL3 and 2DS2 KIRs bind to HLA-C1 allotype (Asp80), while 2DL1 and 2DS1 KIRs bind to HLA-C2 allotype (Lys80). Due to lack of representative data in literature the study was undertaken to determine the association between polymorphism of KIR genes and HLA-C allotypes and susceptibility to B-CLL. Patients and methods The following KIR genes were typed: 2DL1, 2DL2, 2DL3, 3DL1, 2DS1, 2DS2, 2DS3, 2DS4fl, 2DS4del, 2DS5, 3DS1, in 200 B-CLL patients and 199 healthy individuals using PCR-SSP method. The HLA-C1 and HLA-C2 were determined using Olerup SSP typing kit in 187 B-CLL patients and 104 controls. Results Individual KIR gene content was similar in B-CLL cases and healthy controls although patients with KIR2DS3 gene were more common among cases compared to controls (36% vs. 27%, p=0.06) (Table1). The frequency of AA haplotype did not differ between studied groups (29% vs. 28%). Moreover no differences were found between incidence of HLA-C allotypes ( HLA-C1 : 74.3% vs. 76.0%, HLA-C2: 67.4% vs.70.2%), genotypes ( C1/C1 : 32.6% vs 29.8%, C1/C2 : 41.7% vs 46,2% and C2/C2 : 25.7% vs 24.1) and KIR genes in combination with genes for their HLA-C ligands in B-CLL patients and controls ( Table 2 ).
