    "abstract_text": "There are growing evidences that myelo-monocytic cells play a key role in mediating tissue repair and stimulating angiogenesis in response to ischemia. However, the subpopulations of myelo-monocytic cells participating in vascularization and their underlying mechanisms have not been well identified. We previously demonstrated that CD11b + CX3CR1 + cells, a type of proangiogenic myelo-monocytic cells, promotes angiogenesis in a C57BL/6 hind-limb ischemic mouse model. We now provide insight into mechanisms of CD11b + CX3CR1 + cells during recovery of blood perfusion after ischemia. Ischemic injuries were induced by dissecting the femoral artery of C57BL/6 mice. Single-cell suspensions were made from ischemic muscles, and ischemic muscle-derived CD11b + CX3CR1 + cells were isolated with a FACS Sorter. Extracted proteins (50ug) from the cells were loaded on nitrocellulose membranes, containing 53 different capture antibodies in proteome profiler mouse angiogenesis Kits (R&D systems, ARY105). For aortic ring sprouting assay, thoracic aortas were embedded in Matrigel. Proangiogenic effects of CD11b + CX3CR1 + cells were confirmed by enhanced blood perfusion upon injection of additional CD11b + CX3CR1 + cells into ischemic tissues after femoral artery dissection in C57BL/6 mice. Sprouting effects were specifically confirmed through purified CD11b + CX3CR1 + cells co-cultured with aortic ring sprouting assay. Also, medium conditioned by CD11b + CX3CR1 + cells was as efficient as CD11b + CX3CR1 + cells in supporting sprouting, suggesting that vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are likely activated by the proteins secreted by CD11b + CX3CR1 + cells in a paracrine fashion. To investigate whether muscle-derived CD11b + CX3CR1 + cells could secrete angiogenic proteins, we examined the angiogenic proteins in CD11b + CX3CR1 + cells isolated from ischemic muscles after 4 days of surgery. Contrary to our expectations, VEGF proteins were not detected from CD11b + CX3CR1 + cells. However, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, platelet factor-4 (PF-4) and MMP-9 were expressed at a higher level in CD11b + CX3CR1 + cells than those of CD11b + CX3CR1 - and CD11b - CX3CR1 - cells. MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1 and MMP-9 have been reported to promote angiogenesis, while PF-4 is recognized as an angiostatic factor. However, it has recently been reported that PF-4 combined with VEGF is essential for the initial separation of ECs from vessels prior to angiogenic sprouting. It is postulated that, after ischemia, collaboration of VEGF with PF-4 secreted from CD11b + CX3CR1 + cells dissociates the ECs from vessels and promotes vascular branching processes. In summary, CD11b + CX3CR1 + cells are a newly identified myelo-monocytic subset for vessel formation, capable of vascular sprouting via secreting PF-4.
