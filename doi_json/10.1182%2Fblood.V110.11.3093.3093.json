    "abstract_text": "We analyzed the correlation between well-established biological parameters of prognostic relevance in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL] (i.e, mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region [IgV H ], ZAP-70- and CD38-expression) and serum levels of BAFF (B-cell activating factor of the TNF family) by evaluating the impact of these variables on the time to first treatment [TFT] in a series of 69 previously untreated Binet stage A B-cell CLL patients. By using a commercial ELISA (R & D Systems, USA) we found that higher levels of BAFF characterized more frequently patients with Rai stage 0 (P=0.008) and mutated IgV H (P=0.03). In contrast, peripheral blood lymphocytosis (P=0.06), serum \u03b2 2 -m (P=0.159), LDH (P=0.333) and percentage of ZAP-70-positive (P=0.242) or CD38-positive B-CLL cells (P=0.142) did not reflect circulating levels of BAFF. The relationship among various bio-pathological parameters, analyzed by the multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), showed two different clinico-biological profiles. The first, characterized by higher BAFF serum levels (i.e., > 336 ng/mL), presence of mutation in the IgV H , low percentage of CD38-positive B-CLL cells (< 30%) and low LDH was associated with a stable pattern of disease generally not requiring therapy. The second, defined by lower BAFF levels, absence of mutation in the IgV H , high percentage of CD38- positive B-CLL cells and high LDH was associated with a more progressive pattern of disease and a shorter TFT. After a median follow-up time of 35 months (range, 2\u2013120 months) 26 (37.6%) out of 69 patients experienced a need for chemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier estimates of patientsTFT, plotted after searching the best cut-off for BAFF (i.e., 336 ng/mL), demonstrated that low BAFF concentration was associated with a shorter TFT (median TFT 36 months) while median was not reached by patients with BAFF levels higher than 336 ng/mL (P<0.0001). Along with lower serum levels of BAFF (Hazard Ratio [HR], 0.19; P<0.0001), the univariate Cox proportional hazard model identified absence of mutation in IgV H (HR, 0.17; P<0.0001), CD38-positivity (HR, 3.32; P=0.01) and lower platelet count (HR, 0.19; P=0.03) as predictor of shorter TFT. Finally, in multivariate analysis only mutational status of IgV H (HR, 0.25; P=0.007) and serum concentration of BAFF (HR, 034; P=0.04) affected significantly TFT. Our results indicate that in early B-cell CLL clinico-biological profile including among other parameters BAFF may provide a useful insight into the complex interrelationship of prognostic variables and semplify their interpretation. The possible presence of BAFF isoform in B-CLL could peraphs account for the unexpected correlation between low soluble BAFF levels and poor clinical outcome in patients with early disease.",
