Methods : Evaluated the intracellular arsenic concentrations,the apoptosis rates, and the ratios of differentiation phenotypes on cell surface CD33 (\u2212)/CD11b (+), when incubated cells with As 2 O 3 in different culture media in vitro and treated leukaemia patients with As 2 O 3 in different administration styles in vivo. Results : When incubated cells in a constant arsenic concentration culture medium for 24 hours, the intracellular arsenic concentrations were (33.4\u00b10.88) \u03bcg/L in NB 4 , (18.6\u00b11.12) \u03bcg/L in K 562 , and (28.8\u00b10.64) \u03bcg/L in APL; the apoptosis rates were NB 4 56.6%, K 562 27.6%, APL 52.2%; the ratios of differentiation phenotype CD33(\u2212)/CD11b(+) were: NB 4 (19.5\u00b10.5)%, K 562 (24.5\u00b10.6)%, APL (18.5\u00b10.6)%, whereas, when incubated cells above in a changing arsenic concentrations culture medium for 24hours, which initial arsenic level was 5\u03bcmol/L, the intracellular arsenic concentrations were: NB 4 (17.6\u00b10.88) \u03bcg/L, K 562 (9.2\u00b10.64)\u03bcg/L, APL(15.2\u00b11.04)\u03bcg/L, the apoptosis rates were: NB 4 23.2%, K 562 11.0%, APL 21.0%; the ratios of differentiation phenotype CD33 (\u2212)/CD11b (+) were: NB 4 (51.5\u00b10.4)%, K 562 (57.5\u00b10.8)%, APL (46.5\u00b10.5)%. 24hours after one time continuous and slowing intravenous As 2 O 3 infusion, the intracellular arsenic concentrations were APL (26.6\u00b12.5) \u03bcg/L,AML-M 2 (15.5\u00b13.1) \u03bcg/L, CML (18.5\u00b12.3) \u03bcg/L; the apoptosis rates were APL 28.5%, AML-M 2 9.5%, CML 12.5%; the ratios of differentiation phenotype CD33 (\u2212)/CD11b (+) were: APL (29.5\u00b10.5)%, AML-M 2 (28.5\u00b10.6) %, CML (23.5\u00b10.5)%. Whereas, when 24hours after treated with one time general speed intravenous As 2 O 3 , the intracellular arsenic concentrations were: APL(12.3\u00b12.1) \u03bcg/L, AML-M 2 (5.5\u00b12.3) \u03bcg/L, CML (8.5\u00b12.7) \u03bcg/L; the apoptosis rates were: APL 13.2%, AML-M 2 3.9%, CML4.2%; the ratios of differentiation phenotype CD33 (\u2212)/CD11b (+) were: APL (53.6\u00b10.8) %, AML-M 2 (48.5\u00b10.9) %, CML (67.5\u00b10.8) %. Conclusions: The administration styles affect the intracellular arsenic concentrations, the differentiation rates and the ratios of apoptosis of leukaemia cells. Treated with the continuous and slowing intravenous As 2 O 3 infusion can obtain a higher intracellular arsenic concentration, a higher efficiency of apoptosis and a lower differentiation ratio than that in general speed intravenous As 2 O 3 infusion in clinical dosage. The continuous and slowing intravenous As 2 O 3 infusion can promote apoptosis and inhibit from differentiation, so this As 2 O 3 medication can relieve leukocytosis and elevate therapeutic effects.",
