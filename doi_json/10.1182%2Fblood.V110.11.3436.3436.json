    "abstract_text": "Background: The introduction of rituximab into the therapy of DLBCL has improved the prognosis dramatically. However, relapse in CNS is still the issue. We studied the prognosis and risk factors of CNS recurrence in DLBCL. Method: Between Jan. 1996 and Apr. 2007, 441 patients were diagnosed to have DLBCL in our institute, of whom 31 patients were excluded due to CNS involvement at the time of initial diagnosis. We have analyzed 410 cases, in which 37 cases had relapsed in CNS. Before Sep. 2003, 168 patients were treated with the regimen based on CHOP, and after Sep. 2003, 242 patients were treated with the regimen based on CHOP plus rituximab. Once relapsing in CNS, the patients were treated with systemic chemotherapy plus high-dose methotrexate or radiation with intrathecal methotrexate. The risk category by the international prognostic index of these 411 cases was assessed as low: 36%, low-intermediate: 15%, high-intermediate: 23%, and high: 26%. Results: The median age was 71 years old (range: 17\u201392). Median follow-up period was 507 days, and the median period free from relapsing in CNS was 331 days. The mean survival period of the cases with CNS relapse, of the cases relapsed outside the CNS, and of the non-relapsed cases was 1328 days, 2290 days, and 2817days, respectively. The overall survival rate of cases with CNS relapse was significantly lower than that of the cases relapsed outside the CNS, or than that of the non-relapsed cases (p=0.0233, p=0.0003, respectively). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified the increased lactate dehydrogenase (p=0.014), the involvement of more than one extranodal site (p=0.006), and not using rituximab before CNS relapse (p=0.040) as an independent predictor of CNS recurrence. Conclusion: CNS relapse has extremely poor prognosis than relapse outside the CNS in DLBCL. Rituximab may be effective in preventing CNS relapse. Since rituximab poorly penetrates into CNS, this may partly due to the reduction of all recurrence by rituximab. According to the risk assessment in CNS relapse, an effective CNS prophylaxis strategy should be determined.",
