    "abstract_text": "Human myeloma cells have the marked phenotypic heterogeneity of surface marker expressions, possibly because of loss of PAX-5 expression. Especially, ectopic expression of CD56, one of non-B cell lineage markers, is frequently detected on primary myeloma cells from more than 80% patients with overt myeloma. However, only 2 (NOP2 and AMO1) out of 10 myeloma cell lines were CD56(+). In primary myeloma cells as well as CD56(\u2212) myeloma cell lines, the treatment with forskolin could induce the expression of CD56 in the in vitro culture. In most CD56(+) primary myeloma cells as well as myeloma cell lines, the expressions of neuronal cell markers such as neuron specific enolase (NSE), nestin, \u03b2-tubulin III or chromogranin A were found coincidentally. By gene expression profiling, CD56(+) myeloma cell lines showed the marked expressions of transcription factors involved in neuronal cell lineage. On the other hand, addition of IL-6 down-regulated the expression of CD56 in CD56(+) myeloma cell lines in the in vitro culture. In 13 out of 60 patients with overt myeloma, these myeloma cells showed CD56(\u2212) and their values of plasma CRP were significantly increased and MPC-1(\u2212)CD45(+) immature myeloma cells were also increased compared to those in CD56(+) myeloma cases. Therefore, these results indicate that the expression of CD56 is possibly due to phenotypic changes into neuronal cell lineage, and IL-6 can block these phenotypic changes, keeping PAX-5 (\u2212) myeloma cells being uncommitted cells to any lineage.",
