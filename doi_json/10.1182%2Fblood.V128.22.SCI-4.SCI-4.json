    "abstract_text": "Hematopoiesis is highly complex and dynamic, and consist of large numbers of different cells expressing many molecules. Despite intensive research, many long-standing questions in hematopoiesis research remain disputed. One major reason is the fact that we usually only analyze populations of cells - rather than individual cells - at very few time points of an experiment. Tracking of individual cells would be an extremely powerful approach to improve our understanding of molecular cell fate control. We are therefore developing imaging systems to follow the fate of single cells over many generations. We program new software to help recording and displaying the divisional history, position, properties, interaction, etc. of all individual cells over many generations. In addition, novel microfluidics devices are designed and produced to allow improved observation and manipulation of cells. Our technologies allow continuous long-term quantification of protein expression or activity in living cells. Among other approaches, we generate knock in models expressing transcription factor to fluorescent protein fusions from endogenous gene loci. This enables non-invasive long-term live quantification of transcription factor protein dynamics in single stem and progenitor cells throughout their differentiation. The resulting novel kind of continuous quantitative single cell data is used for the generation and falsification of models describing the molecular control of hematopoietic cell fates.
