    "abstract_text": "Background and aim Tetracosactide Acetate (SR-TA) stimulates the release of corticosteroids such as cortisol from the adrenal gland. It is absorbed on to a zinc phosphate complex which ensures the sustained release of the active substance from the intramuscular injection site. SR-TA is currently used in the management of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, juvenile/adult rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthrosis. However, its properties indicate that this compound may be particularly useful in patients unable to tolerate oral glucocorticoid therapy or where normal therapeutic doses of glucocorticoids turned to be ineffective. Eltrombopag is an oral, non-peptide thrombopoietin receptor agonist that has been shown efficacy and safety in chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) patients not responding to previous therapy. Based on these premises, we treated with a combination of Eltrombopag and SR-TA selected ITP patients undergoing a platelet count fluctuation despite a standard eltrombopag dose was given . Material and methods A total of 6 adult patients, female (60%),median (range) age 37 (28 - 54) years, median (range) baseline platelet count 31 (28 - 46) \u00d7 10 9 /L, median of 3 (2 - 4) prior ITP therapies, received a combo of Eltrombopag 50 mg by mouth daily and SR-TA 1 mg intramuscularly daily until the target platelet count of 50\u00d7 10 9 /L was reached, then a dose of 1mg of SR-TA was given every 3 days; in responding patients , i.e. without platelet count fluctuation, the dose was further reduced to 1mg per week. Results 5 out of six patients responded to treatment reaching and maintaining the platelet count between 50\u00d7 10 9 /L and 100\u00d7 10 9 /L. After a median follow-up of 6 months with combo treatment, all patients maintained their response. Self-administration was started by 100% of patients (6/6). No adverse events have been observed. Our experience has shown that eltrompopag/SR-TA combo is effective and safe in maintaining the platelet count above 50x10 9 /L in those patients not reaching this target with the TPO mimetic alone. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
