    "abstract_text": "In recent years, new agents for multiple myeloma treatment (e.g., proteasome inhibitors) have become more efficacious, yet nearly all patients eventually relapse and develop refractory disease. Growing evidence suggests that clonal heterogeneity in multiple myeloma may constitute the basis for treatment resistance. Therefore, a multi-pronged approach with novel agents is needed to increase the efficacy of standard therapy and prevent or overcome resistance to standard treatments. We have undertaken a research effort to discover novel targets that potentiate the anti-tumor effects of proteasome inhibition in myeloma cells. We hypothesized that proteins that are stabilized in tumor cells following proteasome inhibition likely constitute components of both pro-apoptotic and pro-survival pathways. A mass spectrometry approach, referred to as UbiScan\u00ae, was employed to determine the identity and levels of cellular proteins modified with ubiquitin. MM cell lines (U266 and NCI-H929) were treated with either carfilzomib (CFZ) or bortezomib (BTZ) for 1 hour and the ubiquitome was profiled at 1 and 3 hours after culture in drug-free media. A concentration of 125 nM was chosen in order to reflect physiologically relevant drug and target inhibition levels and to induce cell death in \u223c80% of cells after 48 hours. Approximately 400 proteins showed similar increases in ubiquitination with CFZ or BTZ. One of these proteins was PIM2, a serine/threonine proto-oncogene required for plasma cell proliferation that is highly expressed in multiple myeloma cell lines. We determined that ubiquitination on PIM2 was occurring at lysine 61, which is known to be associated with proteasomal degradation. Four hours after exposure to CFZ, PIM2 ubiquitination increased 34.6 and 24.9 fold in U266 and H929 cells, respectively, and similar changes were measured following BTZ treatment. Western blot analysis of CFZ-treated cells showed a dose-dependent accumulation of total PIM2 protein, confirming that the increase in ubiquitination correlated with protein accumulation. Next, we employed a siRNA-mediated knockdown approach to study the role of PIM2 in proteasome inhibitor mediated-cell death. Knockdown of PIM2 caused a 20% - 50% decrease in viability in both myeloma cell lines. When CFZ was added 48 hours after siRNA transfection, a significant and dose-dependent decrease in viability was observed, suggesting a synergistic interaction. Based on these results, we tested the combination of CFZ and (Z)-5-(4-propoxybenzylidene)thiazolidine-2,4-dione (PIM1/2 inhibitor), which is known to inhibit both PIM1 and PIM2. The PIM1/2 inhibitor decreased levels of phosphorylation on 4E-BP1, a downstream target, confirming its activity in cells. Chemical inhibition of PIM2 potentiated the effect of CFZ in both MM cell lines . These data suggest that the combination of targeting PIM2 and the proteasome will be efficacious in the treatment of multiple myeloma. Disclosures: Lin: Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Employment.
