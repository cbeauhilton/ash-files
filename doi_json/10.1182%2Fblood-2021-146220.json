    "abstract_text": "Recent phenotypic, functional and transcriptomic analyses of natural killer (NK) cells in human and animals have established the presence of tissue resident NK(trNK) cells with specific characteristics and a central role in NK memory. The lack of endogenous clonal markers on NK cells impedes understanding the clonal genesis of trNKs. Transplantation of lentivirally-barcoded autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) has allowed tracking of NK cells at a clonal level in rhesus macaques (RM). We reported large KIR-restricted clonal expansions of mature CD56 - CD16 + NK in the peripheral blood (PB) of RM, clonally distinct from myeloid, T, B and CD56 + 16 - NK, persisting for months to years, suggesting self-renewal independent of ongoing production from HSPCs (Wu et al, Cell Stem Cell, 2014 and Science Imm, 2018). We have now used this model to investigate the clonal distribution of NK cell populations in bone marrow (BM), liver, spleen, lymph nodes (LN), jejunum, colon and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Serial of tissue biopsies were obtained from 3 barcoded monkeys by endoscopy and laparotomy overtime at steady state post transplantation , as well as tissues from necropsy. We compared clonal patterns between various trNKs and PB NKs collected from barcoded RM. Tissue or PB NK were defined as CD3-CD14-CD20-NKG2+ (NKG2A+ and NKG2C+), and NK subsets were further sorted for CD16, CD56, CD49a (putative liver tissue memory-like NK marker), and CXCR3 (critical for NK cell migration into tumor or normal tissues). The same expanded CD56 - CD16 + NK clones found in the PB were also detected at high abundance within BM, LN, liver and/or spleen CD56 - CD16 + NK, but not found in tissue CD56 + 16 - NK and CD56 - 16 - NK subsets. The liver and spleen bulk NK clonal patterns were highly correlated, and distinct from other tissues. We also observed tissue specific barcoded NK clones in BAL, jejunum and colon samples with no or very low abundance in other tissues and PB. Strikingly, a group of markedly expanded trNK clones, distinct from the expanded CD56 - CD16 + NK clones present concurrently or previously in PB, were present and shared across all tissues examined. These clones were enriched in CD56 - 16 + trNK and absent in CD56 + 16 - trNK. Notably, in both tissue and PB these clones were expanded in NKG2+ CD56-CD16- NK. These common expanded trNK cells were specifically enriched in both tissue and PB CD56 - 16 - CXCR3 + NK, suggesting a role for this chemokine receptor and the ability of these clones to move between tissues. In contrast, CD49a expression did not enrich for these expanded clones. Clonally-expanded and persistent mature trNK cells, shared across multiple tissues but not present within PB mature CD56 - CD16 + NK subsets, combined with prior functional data suggesting NK memory is restricted to liver or other trNK cells, suggests these clonally-expanded trNK cells may be of interest. The pattern of shared clones across tissues, together with identification of a rare PB CD56-CD16-NK subpopulation harboring the clones, suggests preferential hematogenous homing of these clones to multiple tissues. Further analyses of gene expression and clonal dynamics are ongoing and should shed light on the ontology of trNK cells, with implications for the development of NK based immunotherapies and NK memory.
