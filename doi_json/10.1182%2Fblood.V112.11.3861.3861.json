    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) clonally differentiate into all myeloid, B-lymphoid, and T-lymphoid lineages. Mouse HSCs are known to form in vitro colonies comprised of morphologically identifiable myeloid cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes. Whether HSCs are able to differentiate along B-and T-lymphoid lineages in such colonies remains obscure. The co-culture systems with stromal cells such as S17, OP9, OP9/Delta cells have been shown to support B- and T-cell development. These systems have been used to identify subclasses of progenitors with lymphoid potentials. However, neither B cells nor T cells have been successfully generated from HSCs in vitro . This is most likely due to the lack of culture conditions which support HSCs to differentiate into a certain stage of lymphoid progenitors. In this study, we attempted to use serum-free single-cell culture to identify cytokines which fill the developmental gap between HSCs and lymphoid progenitors. Here we show that myelo-lymphoid colonies are formed by HSCs in the presence of thrombopoietin (TPO), interleukin (IL)-11, or IL-12 together with stem cell factor (SCF). CD34-negative/low, c-Kit-positive, Sca-1-positive, lineage marker-negative (CD34-KSL) bone marrow cells were individually cultured with a combination of cytokines for 7 days. All cells in each colony were transplanted into each from a group of lethally irradiated mice, along with compromised bone marrow cells. The recipient mice were periodically analyzed after transplantation to detect transient myeloid and lymphoid reconstitution. All myeloid, B-, and T-lymphoid progenitor activities were detected in single colonies formed in the presence of SCF+TPO, SCF+IL-11, SCF+IL-12. Only myeloid progenitor activity was predominantly detected in single colonies formed in the presence of SCF+IL-3, consistent with previous observations in blast colony assays. All these combinations of cytokines support self-renewal in HSCs to varying degrees. We conclude that TPO, IL-11, and IL-12 directly act on HSCs and support them to differentiate into progenitors with lymphoid differentiation potential. Early differentiation pathways in HSCs are likely to be used in common by myeloid and lymphoid lineages and be supported in common by multiple cytokines."
