    "abstract_text": "Background: Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) factors regulate activation and Ca 2+ signaling in B-cells. Store-operated Ca 2+ entry (SOCE) is regulated by Orai1 and Stim1 and upstream of NFAT. We previously reported on the observation of autonomous oscillatory Ca 2+ signal activity in BCR-ABL1 -driven B-ALL. Autonomous Ca 2+ oscillations may provide oncogenic survival signals to B-ALL cells, however their significance and mechanism remained unclear. Results: Here we found that autonomous Ca 2+ oscillations are common across multiple subtypes of B-cell lineage ALL and mature B-cell lymphoma and reflect downstream survival and proliferation signals from oncogenic BCR-signaling or oncogenes that mimic active BCR-signaling (e.g. ABL1 -kinase fusions, CD79B mutation, EBV-encoded oncoprotein LMP2A, RAS-pathway lesions). By contrast, multiple myeloma and Hodgkin's lymphoma that lack BCR-expression and function also lack Ca 2+ oscillations ( Figure, top panel ). As Orai1 and Stim1/2 are essential SOCE-effector genes, we performed genetic experiments to test the impact of Cre-mediated deletion of Orai1 and Stim1/2 in BCR-ABL1 and NRAS G12D -dependent models of B-ALL. Inducible deletion of Orai1 or S tim1/2 not only abrogated SOCE but also autonomous Ca 2+ oscillations. Signal amplitudes of residual autonomous Ca 2+ oscillations were significantly reduced ( P < 0.0001; Figure, bottom panel ). Further, deletion of either Orai1 or Stim1/2 induced cell death and abrogated colony-forming capacity in both models of B-ALL. In agreement with these findings, NFATc1 no longer translocated to the nucleus upon Cre-mediated ablation of Orai1 or Stim1/2 induced, which reflected functional inactivation of NFATc1. These results demonstrated that Orai1- and Stim1/2-mediated SOCE signaling and autonomous Ca 2+ oscillations are critical in BCR-ABL1 and NRAS G12D -dependent B-ALL. A NFAT-calcineurin association inhibitor, INCA-6, was tested for its ability to suppress NFATc1 and autonomous Ca 2+ signaling in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of B-ALL, mantle cell lymphoma and DLBCL. Treatment with INCA-6 suppressed survival and proliferation signals in all six PDX of B-ALL, mantle cell lymphoma and DLBCL but not multiple myeloma cells. Unlike myeloma cells, B-ALL, mantle cell and DLBCL cells expressed a functional (pre-)BCR. These findings suggest that the SOCE-NFAT pathway is linked to Ca 2+ signaling downstream of a functional BCR- or oncogenic BCR-mimics. Furthermore, to determine whether high expression levels of ORAI1 , STIM1, STIM2 and NFATC1 represents a biomarker of clinical outcome for patients with B-ALL, we segregated patients from two clinical trials (Children's Oncology Group P9906 (n=207) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (E2993; n=215)) into two groups on the basis of higher or lower than median expression levels of ORAI1 , STIM1 , STIM2 and NFATC1 at the time of diagnosis. Higher than median expression levels of each of these four genes at the time of diagnosis predicted shorter overall and relapse-free survival ( P < 0.02 or lower for each of these genes). These findings identify SOCE-NFAT signal as a novel biomarker with potential use in risk stratification of children and adults with B-ALL. Conclusions: We identified Orai1 and Stim1 as central mediators of SOCE. Most BCR-dependent B-cell malignancies are driven by oncogenic BCR-signals, which result in autonomous Ca 2+ oscillations. While the significance of autonomous Ca 2+ -oscillations remains unclear, deletion of Orai1 and Stim1/2 resulted in a complete loss of Ca 2+ oscillations, loss of NFATc1-activation and cell death. We conclude that previously unrecognized Ca 2+ -oscillations downstream of oncogenic BCR-signaling are required for survival and proliferation of B-ALL and B-cell lymphoma cells. Pharmacological inhibition of SOCE (Orai1 and Stim1/2) or NFATC1 (e.g. INCA-6) represents a selective strategy to disrupt autonomous Ca 2+ oscillations and oncogenic BCR-signaling in a broad range of B-cell malignancies.
