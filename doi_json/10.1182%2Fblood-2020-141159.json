    "abstract_text": "Mutant calreticulin (CALR) has been shown to play a causal role in the development of essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) via activation of the thrombopoietin receptor MPL. The oncogenic property of mutant CALR originates from a +1 frameshift mutation in its carboxyl-terminal domain, which is found in approximately 30% of patients with ET and PMF. Because the domain is uniquely found in mutant CALR, it has been recognized as a neoantigen and can therefore be used to target CALR-mutant cells using immunotherapy. In the present study, we found that a large portion of the domain generated by the frameshift in the mutant CALR was cleaved by an endoprotease belonging to the subtilisin family in multiple cell lines and primary cells. The cleaved form of mutant CALR was detected in the cell lysate; however, it was more abundant in the culture supernatant, implying that the cleavage occurred on the cell surface and/or outside the cells. Using mass spectrometric analysis, we determined the cleavage site of mutant CALR. To examine whether the cleavage was required for the oncogenic properties of mutant CALR, we introduced point mutations at the cleavage site. The mutant CALR construct that was resistant to protease cleavage exhibited full oncogenic capacity when expressed in UT-7/TPO cells. Consistent with this observation, chemical inhibition of the protease, which blocked the cleavage of mutant CALR, did not interfere with mutant CALR-dependent cell growth in UT-7/TPO cells. Next, we generated B3, a rat monoclonal antibody that recognized the mutant-specific sequence, even after cleavage. B3 recognized both the uncleaved and cleaved forms of mutant CALR by immunoblot in cell lysates prepared from the platelets and peripheral blood cells of CALR-mutant ET and PMF patients. B3 also recognized mutant CALR expressed on the cell surfaces of monocytes and granulocytes from CALR-mutant ET and PMF patients. Based on these results, we developed B3-chimera, a mouse chimeric antibody of B3, and evaluated its therapeutic potential for ET in vivo. We used an ET mouse model created by transplantation of LSK (lin - sca1 + c-kit + ) cells transduced with CALR del52 into the bone marrow. Intravenous injection of B3-chimera markedly suppressed the thrombocytosis induced by CALR del52, which was associated with a significant reduction in the megakaryocyte count in the bone marrow (Figure 1). In conclusion, we demonstrated that targeting the cleaved form of mutant CALR on the cell surface was a promising strategy for the treatment of CALR-mutant myeloproliferative neoplasms.
