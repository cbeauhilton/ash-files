    "abstract_text": "Abstract 632 Introduction. Diagnosis of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) depends on the detection of autoantibodies against phospholipid-bound \u03b2 2 -glycoprotein I (\u03b2 2 GPI), the most prominent antigen in APS. One of the main problems faced is the high variability observed between different commercially available anti-\u03b2 2 GPI assays. Anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibodies constitute a heterogeneous population, but predominantly antibodies reacting to a cryptic epitope Glycine40-Arginine43 (G40-R43) in domain I of \u03b2 2 GPI are associated with a strong risk to develop thrombosis. b 2 GPI is present in blood in a native conformation (either circular or S-shaped). After interaction with anionic surfaces it opens up (J-shaped conformation), resulting in exposure of the epitope G40-R43 in domain I. It is therefore important that in diagnostic assays b 2 GPI is presented in the open conformation enabling antibodies to react with the G40-R43 epitope. We hypothesize that the high variability between different commercial anti-b 2 GPI ELISA assays arise from variation in exposure of the G40-R43 epitope of b 2 GPI. Methods. Two patient-derived monoclonal antibodies P2-6 and P1-117 were tested for their reactivity towards \u03b2 2 GPI in different conformations. Using both antibodies, we compared exposure of epitope G40-R43 on \u03b2 2 GPI in five different commercial anti-\u03b2 2 GPI IgG assays. 10 patient samples selected for their low to high positivity towards epitope G40-R43, were tested in two anti-\u03b2 2 GPI IgG assays. Results. Using neutral versus anionic ELISA plates, we have shown that antibody P1-117 specifically reacts with epitope G40-R43, exposed only in the open conformation, while antibody P2-6 recognizes \u03b2 2 GPI irrespective of its conformation ( Fig. 1 ). In one of the tested anti-\u03b2 2 GPI assays, both antibodies showed equal reactivity towards \u03b2 2 GPI, indicating that all the coated \u03b2 2 GPI exposes epitope G40-R43. In this assay, all ten anti-domain I positive patients tested positive. In other assays P1-117 displayed lower reactivity towards \u03b2 2 GPI than P2-6, demonstrating a reduced exposure of G40-R43. Only 3 out of the 10 patients tested positive in such assay, illustrating that a significant number of patients can be falsely assigned negative in assays characterized by a reduced exposure of epitope G40-R43. Conclusions. The exposure of epitope G40-R43 on \u03b2 2 GPI is highly variable in commercial anti-\u03b2 2 GPI assays, and influences the diagnosis of APS. Our results have major implications for the diagnosis of APS, as it provides suitable controls to ensure sufficient exposure of the G40-R43 epitope or suggests the development of alternative assays coating only domain I of \u03b2 2 GPI.
