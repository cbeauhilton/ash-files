    "abstract_text": "Objective To explore the relationship among CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cell, the expression of FOXP3 mRNA levels of donor BM and GVHD in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(allo-HSCT). Methods (1)Thirty patients undergoing allo-HSCT were enrolled in this study. The levels of donor CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cell were compared in the patients with GVHD and those without GVHD by immnofluorescence and flowcytometry. (2)The donor BM expressions of FOXP3 mRNA levels were analyzed by using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results (1)All patients achieved engraftment. ANC \u2265 0.5\u203210 9 \u2022L \u22121 and Plt \u2265 20\u203210 9 \u2022L \u22121 were at day 14(range, 12~15)and day 18 (range, 15~25) respectively. Acute GVHD occurred in 15 of 30 patients(50.0%) with gradeII\u00b0-IV\u00b0 aGVHD (40.0%). Chronic GVHD developed in 6 (extensive 2, limited 4) out of 30 patients (20.0%). 3 patients relapsed.(2)The levels of CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cell pre-and pro-mobilization were (2.67\u00b10.38) % and (5.01\u00b1 1.33)% respectively, no difference were observed(P>0.05).(3)Patients with I\u00b0~II\u00b0 aGVHD demonstrated higher donor-type CD4 + CD25 + immune regulatory T cell level than those with III\u00b0~IV\u00b0 aGVHD; Patients with III\u00b0~IV\u00b0 aGVHD showed much lower donor-type CD4 + CD25 + immune regulatory T cell level than those without GVHD; no difference were observed between patients withI\u00b0~II\u00b0 aGVHD and those without aGVHD.(4)The transcripts of FOXP 3 donor BM were detected in seven donors of thirty recipients who received allo-HSCT. Three relapsed after transplantation;two developedI\u00b0aGVHD; and the other two had no GVHD. Donor BM FOXP 3 transcripts were never detected in patients with II\u00b0~IV\u00b0 aGVHD. Conclusion(1)Donor-type CD4 + CD25 + immune regulatory T cell level was relative to recipient II\u00b0~IV\u00b0 aGVHD. Up-grade donor-type CD4 + CD25 + immune regulatory T cell level could reduce the incidence of aGVHD.(2)Donor BM FOXP 3 transcripts were detected in patients without serious aGVHD after transplantation.",
