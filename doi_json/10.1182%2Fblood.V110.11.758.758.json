    "abstract_text": "Improved outcomes for children with acute lympboblastic leukemia (ALL) have been achieved, in part, from adaptation of risk-stratified therapy. The Children\u2019s Oncology Group (COG) has implemented a real-time risk classification system (AALL03B1) using a combination of NCI-Rome risk criteria, blast cell genetic features, and early treatment response to determine the intensity of post-induction therapy. Between December 29, 2003 and June 1, 2007, more than 4,000 children over 1 year of age with B-precursor ALL were enrolled on AALL03B1, including 2293 (62%) with NCI Standard Risk (SR) and 1406 (38%) with NCI High Risk (HR) features who were subsequently enrolled on companion clinical trials. The most favorable genetic features used in AALL03B1 were identified in legacy COG studies and included TEL/AML1 (TEL) or triple trisomies of chromosomes 4, 10, and 17 (TT). Unfavorable genetic features included the presence of BCR/ABL , MLL rearrangements, or extreme hypodiploidy (DNA index  0.1% at day 29 were defined as slow early responders (SER). Among the favorable cytogenetic subsets, patterns of early response differed. The presence of TEL was significantly associated with an RER to induction therapy in both NCI SR and HR groups (p< 0.0001), while the presence of TT was not (p=0.058). For NCI SR patients, the presence of TEL was significantly associated with the achievement of an M1 bone marrow by day 8 (50.9% of TEL+ pts vs. 41.2% of TEL- pts, p< 0.0001). Patients with an M1 or M2 BM on day 29 who had MRD >1% received extended induction (EI) for two weeks followed by an additional evaluation of BM morphology and MRD at day 43 of induction. One hundred and nineteen patients received EI, with 40% having NCI SR features at diagnosis. Of the patients who received EI, 63% achieved an M1 marrow with MRD < 1% by day 43 and were eligible to continue on protocol therapy. This was more likely to occur in NCI SR patients (77% vs. 55%, p 220 COG institutions.",
