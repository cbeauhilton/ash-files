    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3396 Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the BCR/ABL fusion gene. However, secondary molecular events leading to accelerated (AP) or blast phase (BP) have not been sufficiently clarified. We hypothesized that, in analogy to other MDS/MPN or MPN, TET2 , ASXL1 , CBL and IDH family mutations may also occur in CML and contribute as secondary events leading to progression to AP or BP. Similarly, higher resolution of cytogenetic testing by single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A)-based karyotyping may reveal additional chromosomal abnormalities associated with stepwise progression. This study is focused on the combined analysis of chromosomal lesions and mutations associated with AP, BP and Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the association of these defects with clinical features. We screened TET2 , ASXL1 , CBL and IDH for mutations in AP (N=14) and BP (N=26) and Ph+ ALL (N=9). Chronic phase (CP) (N=14) and Ph negative ALL (N=9) served as controls. We identified 3 CBL family (9%), 7 TET2 (21%), 2 ASXL1 (6%) and 2 IDH family (6%) mutations in patients with AP and myeloid BP. Subsequently, we also detected a TET2 mutation in a case of Ph+ ALL. None of these mutations were found in patients with CP or Ph negative ALL. We also performed SNP-A-based karyotyping and only included lesions which did not overlap with copy number variations (CNVs) or germ line regions of homozygosity present in any of the controls. 23 gains, 21 losses and 4 regions of somatic UPD lesions were identified. By SNP-A, additional copy number abnormalities, including microdeletions were found in 67% and 50% of patients with AP and BP, respectively. Recurrent lesions were detected on chromosome 1, 8, 9, 17 and 22. Microdeletions on chromosome 17 and 21 involved tumor associated genes NF1 and RUNX1 . Deletions flanking the ABL1 and BCR genes were observed in 3 cases with der(22)t(9;22) or der(9)t(9;22) by metaphase cytogenetics. Gains including 1q25.3q41, chromosome 8 and 17q24.3 were found in 3 cases. Regions of UPD included UPD5q, 8q, 11p and 17q but no UPD involving 11q ( CBL ) and 4q ( TET2 ) regions were found confirming heterozygous nature of the corresponding mutations. Newly detected molecular lesions associated with AP and BP may change the biology and thereby clinical features of affected cases. Overall survival of patients with mutations did not differ from those without mutations. Of note is that BCR/ABL1 kinase domain mutations were detected in 9/10 patients with imatinib resistance. In these 9 cases, 3 TET2 and 2 CBLB mutations were detected (but no mutations in the other genes). In an imatinib-resistant patient without BCR/ABL1 kinase domain mutation , CBL mutation was present. In the patients with TET2 mutations, additional chromosomal lesions were found by SNP-A, significantly more frequently when compared with WT cases (P=0.017). Of the 9 TET2 variants in 8 cases, 7 (78%) were missense substitutions, 1 (11%) was frame shift and 1 (11%) produced a stop codon and were located within the N-terminus as well as in a conserved DSBH 2OG-Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase domain. The presence of nonsense and frameshift mutations suggests that mutated lesions result in inactivation, consistent with putative tumor suppressor functions, while heterozygous mutations indicate that the wild type allele is not completely protective. Since no TET2 mutations were identified in chronic phase CML, these mutations might represent an additional pathogenic event and contribute to progression. In 3 cases we observed a combination of 2 mutations. Coincidence of CBLB and TET2 mutations in 2 cases suggests that these might cooperate in the evolution of advanced phase of CML. We also found a combination of IDH1 and ASXL1 mutations in a patient with BP, suggesting that both mutations contribute to clonal advantage. In conclusion, while CBL family, ASXL1 and IDH family mutations as well a additional unbalanced chromosomal abnormalities not seen by metaphase cytogenetics can occur in myeloid type advanced phase CML, TET2 mutations were identified in Ph+ ALL, as well as myeloid BP and AP. These mutations likely represent secondary lesions which contribute to either disease progression or more aggressive features and commonly occur in association with imatinib-resistant BCR/ABL mutations.
