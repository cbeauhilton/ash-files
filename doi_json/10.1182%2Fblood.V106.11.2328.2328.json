    "abstract_text": "Patients with sickle cell disease have decreased nitric oxide bioavailability, and studies from several groups have confirmed a blunted response to various NO donors in humans and mice with sickle cell disease. Recently published studies show that nitrite induces vasodilation in humans, apparently mediated by conversion of nitrite to NO. This study is designed to determine the potential therapeutic effect of intra-arterial nitrite infusion to restore nitric oxide dependent blood flow in the forearms of patients with sickle cell disease. Venous occlusion strain gauge plethysmography is used to measure the change of forearm blood flow in patients with sickle cell disease, before and after sequential brachial artery infusions of increasing doses of sodium nitrite. In addition, NO responsiveness before and after nitrite infusion is measured by test doses of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Six patients have completed the study and enrollment is continuing. These data indicate that nitrite promotes regional blood flow in patients with sickle cell disease, albeit with a blunted response compared to our healthy control subjects, in whom we previously have found increased blood flow up to 187% with comparable dosing. The significant but blunted response is consistent with the state of nitric oxide resistance to NO donors that has been seen by several groups in patients and mice with SCD. Additionally, we find in these patients that nitrite partially restores SNP responsiveness, with baseline maximal SNP responses more than doubling on average following nitrite infusion, although this finding is preliminary. No adverse effects of nitrite were seen in these six patients. Our early results support a role for nitrite as an NO donor effective in restoring NO-dependent blood flow in patients with sickle cell disease. Additional translational studies are warranted to evaluate the therapeutic effects of systemic nitrite dosing. Table 1. Forearm Blood Flow Response to Nitrite Infusion  Nitrite Dose (micromole/min) .
