    "abstract_text": "The transcription factor PLZF is expressed in hematopoietic development and rearranged in t(11;17) acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). PLZF expression is high in the quiescent progenitor CD34+ cell, and declines during differentiation along myeloid and erythroid lineages. PLZF encodes a BTB-Zinc finger transcriptional repressor that inhibits the cell cycle through inhibition of targets genes such as cyclin A and c-myc through the recruitment of histone deacetylase complexes. However, PLZF itself is regulated by acetylation. In a separate study we demonstrate that acetylation of PLZF by p300/CBP enhances the transcriptional repression activity of PLZF. Through a yeast two-hybrid study we found that PLZF associates with the protein deacetylase SIRT1. SIRT1 is a member of the sirtuin family of class III histone deacetylases. In model organisms such as yeast, worms and flies, sirtuins play a common role in lifespan extension. The interaction between PLZF and SIRT1 was confirmed by co-precipitation of endogenous proteins and localized to the zinc fingers of PLZF, the region targeted for acetylation by p300/CBP. Acetylation of PLZF mediated by p300/CBP was reversed by SIRT1. Furthermore while acetylation of PLZF enhances its ability to repress transcription, co-expression of SIRT1 decreased PLZF transcriptional repression activity, consistent with loss of acetylation. Conversely, inhibition of SIRT1 activity with nicotinamide enhanced both PLZF acetylation and transcriptional repression of PLZF on its endogenous target gene c-myc. Further, increasing PLZF acetylation by inhibition of SIRT1 was associated with decreased PLZF stability. Acetyl-PLZF levels were stabilized by inhibition of the proteosomal degradation machinery, together implying that PLZF acetylation and activation results in increased protein turnover. These data point to the increasing complexity of the role of acetylation in transcriptional regulation and stand in contrast with data for the related Bcl6 repressor where acetylation of the protein inhibits repression. These data also indicate a novel function for sirtuins in regulation of transcriptional repression.",
