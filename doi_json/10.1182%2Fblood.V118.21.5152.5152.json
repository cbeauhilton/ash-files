Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) comprise a group of diseases with some features of MDS and is separately classified in the current WHO system. While the immunophenotype of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia has been described in detail, data is scarce on the use of MFC in myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms, unclassifiable (MDS/MPNu) as well as on refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (RARS-T), which is a provisional entity in the current WHO classification. Aim: To assess patients with MDS/MPNu and RARS-T for MDS-related aberrant immunophenotypes in the context of a comprehensive diagnostic work-up including cytomorphology, cytogenetics, and molecular genetics. Patients and Methods: A total of 91 patients were analyzed in parallel by cytomorphology, cytogenetics, and MFC applying an antibody panel designed to diagnose MDS. MFC was used to detect expression of mature antigens in myeloid progenitors; abnormal CD13-CD16- and CD11b-CD16-expression patterns, aberrant expression of myeloid markers and reduced side scatter signal in granulocytes; reduced expression of myelomonocytic markers in monocytes; aberrant expression of CD71 in erythroid cells; as well as expression of lymphoid markers in all myeloid cell lines. In 77/91 patients molecular genetic markers were investigated. The median age of the patients was 75.1 years (range, 35.3\u201387.4). The male/female ratio was 60/31. Six patients had RARS-T and 85 had MDS/MPNu. Results: In 54/91 (59.3%) patients MFC identified an MDS-immunophenotype. This was true in 4/6 (66.7%) RARS-T and in 50/85 (58.8%) MDS/MPNu (n.s.). Cases with MDS-immunophenotype displayed aberrancies significantly more frequently than those without as follows: in myeloid progenitor cells (number of aberrantly expressed antigens, mean\u00b1SD: 0.5\u00b10.6 vs. 0.2\u00b10.4, p=0.002), granulocytes (2.7\u00b11.3 vs. 1.2\u00b11.1, p<0.001), and monocytes (1.7\u00b11.2 vs. 0.5\u00b10.7, p<0.001). Accordingly, there was a significant difference in the total number of aberrantly expressed antigens (4.9\u00b12.4 vs. 2.0\u00b11.4, p<0.001). The presence of an aberrant karyotype was not related to an MDS-immunophenotype which was observed in 11/18 (61.1%) cases with aberrant karyotype and in 43/73 (58.9%) with normal karyotype (n.s.). Mutations in RUNX1 and TET2 as well as FLT3 -ITD were predominantly present in cases with an MDS-immunophenotype (10/33, 30.3%) and occurred less frequently in cases without (1/7, 9.1%, n.s.). In detail, RUNX1 mutations were present in 4/26 (10.3%) vs. 0/2, TET2 mutations were present in 4/6 (66.7%) vs. 1/2 (50%), and FLT3 -ITD was present in 3/29 (10.3%) vs. 0/5. Accordingly, in cases with RUNX1 or TET2 mutations or with FLT3 -ITD a significantly higher number of aberrantly expressed antigens was observed as compared to cases with none of these mutations (mean\u00b1SD, 6.4\u00b12.0 vs. 4.4\u00b12.5, p=0.024). In contrast, JAK2 V617F mutations occurred at identical frequencies in patients with and without MDS-immunophenotype (11/38, 28.9% vs. 9/31, 29.0%). Regarding prognosis, the presence of an MDS-immunophenotype had no impact on overall survival. Conclusions: These data demonstrates that MDS-related aberrant antigen expression is present in the majority of patients with RARS-T and MDS/MPNu. While there is no association between the presence of an MDS-immunophenotype and the detection of JAK2 mutations cases with an MDS-immunophenotype tended to more frequently carry mutations in RUNX1 and TET2 as well as FLT3 -ITDs. These data therefore suggests that MDS/MPNu may be subdivided based on molecular genetics and on the immunophenotype into cases with MDS-related features and those without. Further analyses are needed to validate these findings and their potential significance in RARS-T. Disclosures: Kern: MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory: Employment, Equity Ownership.
