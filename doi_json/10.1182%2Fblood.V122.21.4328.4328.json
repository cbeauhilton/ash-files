    "abstract_text": "Introduction Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL) is an indolent lymphoma in which the use of PET/CT is poorly explored and also controversial due to the heterogeneous 18F- FDG avidity described in these types of lymphoma. Our aim in the present study is to evaluate the role of 18F-FDG-PET/ CT (PET/CT) in comparison to CT with intravenous contrast enhancement at initial staging and response assessment to chemotherapy in these patients. Methods and Materials A retrospective single-center study that included 34 patients, diagnosed of MZL between 1998 and 2012, with at least one PET/CT available. A total of 55 PET/ CT were performed: 25 at initial diagnosis, 19 for first- line response assessment, 6 in relapse and 5 after relapse- treatment. Locations of involved areas were registered comparing staging CT and PET/CT and were classified as discrepancy or not. Results Patients\u00b4 baseline characteristics are shown in table 1. At diagnosis, all patients presented with at least one abnormal focal FDG uptake except for one, which reflected a sensitivity of 96%. Median SUVmax was higher in nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL) and extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (ENMZL): 6,1 (4- 8,4) and 6,9 (2- 13,8) respectively, in comparison to splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) 3,4 (3,2- 3,6) p=0,3. SUVmax was much higher in a patient with histological transformation to a DLBCL (SUVmax 37). Among 17 patients with both radiological imaging at the time of diagnosis, there were 8 patients (47%) with more involved areas demonstrated by PET/ CT than by CT alone, 75% of them were extranodal lesions. PET/CT upstaged 5 patients but in only 2 of them entailed a change in therapeutic management. Four patients did not show FDG avidity by PET/CT in some areas suspected to be involved by CT, what generated a CT sensitivity of 76%. Table 1 Patients\u00b4 baseline characteristics (N=33).

N=21(63%) N=4(12.1%) N=3(9%) N=5(15.1%) View Large Overall, CR was attained in 24 patients (66%) with 5-y OS 78%. Among 19 patients with a PET/CT available for first-line response assessment, responses were: 12 CR, 2 PR, 1PD and isolated residual lesions in 4 patients. Progression was documented in 2 of the 4 patients with residual lesions which were considered positive, and in 2 patients who maintained remission, the image was interpreted as a false positive (FP). The response assessment was performed by both radiological imaging in 13 patients. Discrepancies were found in 4 cases: CT showed CR in 3 patients while PET/CT detected localized residual disease and in another patient, CT showed stable disease whereas PET/CT demonstrated CR. Overall, none of the patients in CR by PET/CT relapsed. Five-year OS was 100% in contrast to 64% for those patients with a positive PET/CT after completing treatment (p=0,2), with a mean follow-up of 50 months (10-152). The NPV was 100% and PPV was 71% (5/7). Relapse was detected in 9 patients (37.5%). Six patients had PET/CT for re-staging and 5 for response assessment. All re-staging PET/CT had FDG-avidity with a median SUVmax of 9.9 (4.6-17.2). PET/CT for response after salvage treatment demonstrated 3 CR and 2 localized residual lesions. The NPV and PPV was 100% and 50%, respectively. Conclusions MZL shows higher 18F- FDG avidity in NMZL y ENMZL subtypes. PET/CT is more sensitive than CT at initial staging, chiefly in identifying extranodal involvement. Response assessment PET/CT had a NPV of 100% and PPV of 71 and 50% after first and second-line treatment, respectively. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
