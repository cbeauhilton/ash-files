    "abstract_text": "Introduction and Methods: Salvage chemotherapy followed by high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is standard care for relapsed/refractory DLBCL. In the CORAL study, 477 patients were assigned to one of two salvage regimens (R-DHAP or R-ICE). Only the 240 responding patients underwent per protocol ASCT and were randomly assigned to rituximab or observation. The four-year event-free survival (EFS) post ASCT were 52 and 53% for the rituximab and observation groups, respectively (p=.7). Secondary IPI (sIPI) independently predicted EFS, PFS and OS after ASCT (Gisselbrecht et al , JCO 2010 & 2012). Outcome data are limited in DLBCL patients who relapse after ASCT, with reported overall survival (OS) of 9.9 months in rituximab-pretreated patients (Nagle et al , AJH 2013). To shed more light on outcome and prognostic factor in this population, 75 patients included in the CORAL study who relapsed after scheduled BEAM/ASCT were reviewed. Results: Median time between ASCT scheduled in CORAL and relapse was 7.1 months (range 3.1-61.9) with 32.9% relapsing > 12 months. Median age was 56.1y (range 20.9-67.7), M/F ratio 51/24, sIPI 0-2 in 71.6%, >2 in 28.4%. 49.3% were in the rituximab and 45.3% in the observation arm of the CORAL. All patients had previously received rituximab. Third-line therapy consisted of ICE-type (17.3%), DHAP-type (24%), gemcitabine-containing (28%), CHOP-like (13.3%), and miscellaneous regimens (17.3%). Overall response rate to third-line chemotherapy was 44%, with 32% complete response (CR)/CR unconfirmed (CRu), and 12% PR. Among the 75 patients, 16 (21.6%) could eventually be transplanted 3 ASCT and 13 allogeneic SCT with conditioning regimens including fludarabine. Median OS, calculated from time of relapse until death, was 10.0 months (95% CI 6.6-12.6; min: 0.9-max: 55.2 months; median follow-up: 32.8 months) with an estimated 1-y OS of 39.1%. Median OS was statistically different (p=.0007) according to sIPI at CORAL failure: sIPI 0-2: 12.6 months (1-y OS 51.3%), sIPI > 2: 5.3 months (1-y OS 21.6%, HR 2.805). Median OS in patients achieving CR/CRu, PR, or no response after third-line regimen was 37.7 m (1-y OS 90.5%, p 6 and < 12 months (11.3 months, n=21) or > 12 months after ASCT (12.6 months, p=0.01, fig. 1)). In multivariate Cox analysis (with the following variables entered: age, sex, sIPI, response to third line and time between CORAL ASCT and relapse), sIPI >2 (HR 2.464, p=0.01), achievement of CR (HR 0.1, p<.0001) or PR (HR 0.242, p=0.02), and post-ASCT remission lasting < 6 months (HR 2.270, p=0.05) independently predicted for OS. Conclusions: Overall, the outcome of DLBCL patients relapsing after second-line R-DHAP/R-ICE followed by ASCT is poor. However, prognostic factors predicting better outcome in this group are late (> 6 months) relapse, lower sIPI and achieving at least PR after third-line salvage followed by transplantation. In the transplanted patients (allo SCT or second ASCT) a 2-year OS of 50% was observed. Thus, new salvage regimens can be a bridge to transplantation in patients with late relapse and/or low sIPI,. New drugs improving salvage efficacy are urgently needed, especially for patients relapsing < 6 months following ASCT. Figure 1.
