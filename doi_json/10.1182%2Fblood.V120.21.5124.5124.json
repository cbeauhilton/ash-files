    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5124 Background & Objectives: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a complex genetic disease involving many fusion oncogenes (FGs) (Xu et al., 2012). The frequency of various FO can vary in different ethnic groups & these FGs have important implications for prognosis & treatment outcome (van-Dongen et al, 1999). Methods: We studied FGs in 101 pediatric ALL patients using Interphase FISH & RT-PCR (van-Dongen et al, 1999), & their association with clinical features & treatment outcome. Results: Five most common FGs i. e. BCR-ABL [t(9;22)], TCF3-PBX1 [t(1;19)], ETV6-RUNX1 [t(12;21)], MLL-AF4 [t(4;11)] & SIL-TAL1 (del 1p32) were found in 89/101 (88. 1%) patients. Frequency of BCR-ABL was 44. 5% (45/101) ( Table 1 ). BCR-ABL positive patients had a significantly lower survival (43. 73 \u00b1 4. 24 weeks) ( Figure 1 )& higher white cell count as compared to others except patients with MLL-AF4. The highest relapse-free survival (RFS) was documented in ETV6-RUNX1 (14. 167 months) followed closely by those cases in which no gene was detected (13/100). RFS in BCR-ABL, MLL-ASF4, TCF-PBX4 & SIL-TAL1 was less than 10 months (7. 994, 3. 559, 5. 500 & 8. 080 months respectively) ( Figure 2 & 3). BCR-ABL: Frequency of occurrence was directly proportional to age (3 less than 2 year age group, 16 in the 2\u20137 year age group & 26 in the older than 7 group. Total leukocyte count (TLC) was higher when compared to patients with other oncogenes. Organomegaly was not common. BCR-ABL positivity was associated with low remission rates & shortened survival. ETV6-RUNX1: The median age of the patients was 1. 85 years. The gene frequency was highest in patients younger than 2 years. TLC was not very high & patients had a good prognosis. MLL-AF4: 17 patients had MLL-AF4 gene rearrangement with a median age of 9 years. Five patients were younger than 2 years, two between 2 & 7 years, & ten patients were in the 7\u201315 age group. Majority of our patients were older unlike the usual occurrence where most of the patients are infants. TCF3-PBX1: This FG occurs in around 2% of patients. Only two female patients were diagnosed with this translocation. Both the patients were over 2 years of age. It was associated with an inferior outcome in the context of response to chemotherapy & a higher risk of CNS relapse although small numbers preclude any firm conclusions. SIL-TAL1: Patients were older than 2 years, with the majority falling in the age range 7 to 15 years. The immunophenotype data were available in all SIL-TAL1 patients showing this fusion gene was associated with T-ALL with organomegaly being observed frequently. Discussion & Conclusion: This is the first study from Pakistan correlating molecular markers with disease biology & treatment outcome in pediatric ALL. Our study revealed the highest reported frequency of BCR-ABL FO in pediatric ALL, in consistent with various other reports from Pakistan & rest of the world ((Iqbal & Akhtar, 2007; Faiz et al ., 2011; (Gaynon et al., 1997; Iacobucci et al., 2012).) which, consequently, was associated with poor overall survival. The data indicates an immediate need for incorporation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of BCR-ABL+ pediatric ALL in this population & the development of facilities for stem cell transplantation.
