    "abstract_text": "Background . Management of patients with suspected Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is problematic if diagnostic imaging is not available. Pretest Clinical Probability (PCP) and D-dimer (D-d) assessment were shown to be useful to identify those high risk patients for whom empirical, protective anticoagulation is indicated ( Siragusa S et al. Arch Intern Med  2004 ; 164 : 2477 \u201382 ). Objective of the study . In consecutive patients with suspected PE, we evaluated whether PCP and D-d assessment, together with the use of low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), allow objective appraisal of PE to be deferred for up to 72 hours. Methods . In case of deferment of diagnostic imaging for PE, patients identified at high-risk (those with high PCP and those with moderate PCP and a positive D-d), received a protective full-dose treatment of LMWH; the remaining patients were discharged without anticoagulants. All patients were scheduled to undergo objective tests for PE (ventilation/perfusion lung scanning or computed tomography lung scan) within 72 hours from the index visit (figure). Standard antithrombotic therapy was then administered when diagnostic tests confirmed Venous ThromboEmbolism (VTE). Results . 336 patients with suspected PE were included in this study. The prevalence of VTE was 6.1% (95% CI 2.7\u20139.3) in the \u201clow-risk group\u201d and 50.4% (95% CI 41.7\u201359.1) in the \u201chigh-risk group\u201d. In total, VTE was confirmed in 76 (22.6%) of 336 patients (95% CI 18.2\u201327). Patients\u2019 characteristics, median time for deferral test and for LMWH administration are listed in table 1. Events at the short-term (72 hours) and long-term follow-up are listed in table 2. None of the patients had major bleeding events during the follow-ups. Conclusions . When objective diagnostic assessment of PE is not immediately available, management of symptomatic PE patients can prove highly unsatisfactory. This study demonstrates that a simple and reproducible approach allows a safe deferral of diagnostic imaging for PE for up to 72 hours. patients\u2019 characteristics  Baseline features .
