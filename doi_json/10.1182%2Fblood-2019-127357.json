    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Acute leukemias (AL) are clonal diseases classified into two large groups: acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), more common in children, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), more rare in childhood, besides the rare phenotype leukemias such as acute biphenotypic leukemia (ABL) and undifferentiated acute leukemia (UAL). Although the cytomorphology still be relevant in theses leukemias diagnoses, the immunophenotyping by flow cytometry (FC) have become essential in the diagnosis, classification and follow-up of these neoplasms, standing out as a modern and practical methodology, presenting characteristically as a method of multiparametric and quantitative analysis of the leukemic cells. Objective: The objective of this study was realize a retrospective study of immunophenotyping in 371 patients with AL. Methodology: Immunophenotyping was performed biological samples by FC after labeling with a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific for AL directed against lymphoid antigens (B, T and NK cells), myeloid, and markers related to other cell immaturity. At the same time, information was obtained regarding patients such as age, sex, clinical data related to the disease, and previous hematological analysis. Results: From 371 cases, 127 were ALL (71 B lineage and 55 T=ALL), 239 AML, 04 ABL and 2 UAL. In the ALL, it was observed a higher frequency in children, contrasting with the cases of AML, ABL and UAL more prevalent in adults. In ALL, clinical signs and laboratorial data related to disease were more present in the ALL-T and mature-B corroborating with information in the literature. In AML, ABL and UAL the most clinical parameters observed were splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and bleeding. The classification FAB subtypes of AML more predominant were M1, M2 and M4 and lower incidence of the M7 subtype. Conclusion: These data demonstrate the importance of FC technology in the diagnosis, classification and establishment of prognostic factors of these neoplasms.
