    "abstract_text": "Chronic idiopathic/immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder in which anti-platelet antibodies induce platelets destruction due to an imbalanced immune response. Recently, data indicated the \u03b3\u03b4+T cells may play an important role in mediated autoimmune disease. Our previous study has showed the restricted expression of TCR V\u03b2 subfamilies and the alteration of peripheral TCR V\u03b2 repertoire pattern in the majority of ITP patients. In the present study, we farther analyze the feature of TCR V\u03b3 and TCR V\u03b4 repertoire distribution and clonality in patients with ITP. The CDR3 size of three TCR V\u03b3 and eight TCR V\u03b4 subfamily genes were analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 8 cases with ITP and 10 healthy individuals, using RT-PCR and genescan technique. To determine the expression level of TCR V\u03b3 subfamily genes, quantitative analysis of TCR V\u03b3 I\u2013III subfamilies was performed by real-time PCR. TCR V\u03b3 I to III subfamilies could be detected in the most samples from ITP as well as in healthy control. However, oligoclonal expansion of TCR V\u03b3 I was identified in 3 cases with ITP, which display polyclonality in all of samples from healthy control. The expression level of all TCR V\u03b3 I\u2013III subfamilies in PBMCs from ITP was significant lower than that from healthy control (P=0.003,P=0.000,P=0.005 respectively). the pattern of TCR V\u03b3 I\u2013III repertoire in ITP was TCR V\u03b3I> TCR V\u03b3III> TCR V\u03b3II, in contrast, TCR V\u03b3II> TCR V\u03b3I> TCR V\u03b3II was found in healthy control. TCR V\u03b41 and TCR V\u03b42 could be detected in most samples from ITP as well as in healthy control, whereas TCR V\u03b43 could be detected only in 2 out of 8 cases with ITP, which could be found in 90% of healthy controls (p=0.02), TCR V\u03b48 could not be identified in all of samples from ITP, which could be found in 30% of healthy control. Oligoclonal expanded TCR V\u03b41and TCR V\u03b42 T cells could be identified in the half of samples from ITP, similar results were found in healthy control. In conclusions, the alteration of peripheral TCR V\u03b3 and TCR V\u03b4 repertoire pattern might be important in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated platelet destruction in some cases with ITP. Our report is the first description of feature of TCR V\u03b3 and TCR V\u03b4 repertoire pattern in ITP patients.",
