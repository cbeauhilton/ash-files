    "abstract_text": "Recent studies demonstrate that inflammatory signals regulate hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is often induced with infection and plays a key role in the stress granulopoiesis response. However, its effects on HSCs are unclear. Herein, we show that treatment with G-CSF induces expansion and increased quiescence of phenotypic HSCs, but causes a marked, cell-autonomous HSC repopulating defect. RNA profiling and flow cytometry studies of HSCs from G-CSF treated mice show that multiple toll- like receptors (TLRs) are upregulated in HSCs upon G-CSF treatment, and gene set enrichment analysis shows enhancement of TLR signaling in G-CSF-treated HSCs. G-CSF-induced expansion of phenotypic HSCs is reduced in mice lacking the TLR signaling adaptors MyD88 or Trif, and the induction of quiescence is abrogated in mice lacking these adaptors. Furthermore, loss of TLR4 mitigates the G-CSF-mediated HSC repopulating defect. Interestingly, baseline HSC function is also dependent on TLR signaling. We show that HSC long-term repopulating activity is enhanced in Tlr4 -/- and MyD88 -/- mice, but not Trif -/- mice. One potential source of TLR ligands affecting HSC function in the bone marrow is the gut microbiota. Indeed, we show that in mice treated with antibiotics to suppress intestinal flora, G-CSF induced HSC quiescence and hematopoietic progenitor mobilization are attenuated. Moreover, in germ free mice, HSC long-term repopulating activity is enhanced. Collectively these data suggest that low level TLR agonist production by commensal flora contributes to the regulation of HSC function and that G-CSF negatively regulates HSCs, in part, by enhancing TLR signaling. Our finding of enhanced TLR signaling upon G-CSF treatment, and the mitigation of G-CSF\u2019s effects in mice deficient for TLR signaling or commensal organisms, suggest that TLR antagonists and/or agonists may ultimately be used clinically to enhance engraftment following bone marrow transplantation or applied toward the treatment of patients with bone marrow failure.
