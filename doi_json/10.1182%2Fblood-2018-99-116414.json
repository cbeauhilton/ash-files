    "abstract_text": "Background MBL is a precursor state to CLL, with a prevalence of ~5-8% in the general population and 15-18% in CLL families. To date, 41 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found to be associated with CLL. We previously showed that a PRS of the weighted average of the number of risk alleles of these SNPs is associated with CLL risk using cases and controls from the International Lymphoma Epidemiology (InterLymph) Consortium. We validated this score in an independent sample of CLL cases and controls from the Genetic Epidemiology of CLL (GEC) Consortium, a cohort of families with \u22652 members with CLL. In the CLL families we also reported an association between the PRS and MBL risk, where 93% of MBLs were low-count MBL. Here we evaluate the PRS in an independent sample ascertained from the Mayo Clinic Biobank. Methods The Mayo Clinic Biobank is a large-scale bio-repository of adult patients assembled to provide a wide array of health-related research studies. Biobank participants (N=2530) were screened for MBL using a highly-sensitive, 8-color (CD38, CD45, Kappa, Lambda, CD19, CD23, CD5 and CD20) flow-cytometry assay on stored cryopreserved peripheral blood mononucleotide cells. Low-count and high-count MBL were defined as those individuals who had <85% and \u226585 clonal B-cells out of total B-cells, respectively. Individuals without MBL (\"controls\") were frequency matched to MBLs based on age and sex, after excluding non-Caucasian and non-interpretable flow results. Participants were genotyped using the Illumina OmniExpress array. Standard genotyping quality-control metrics were applied. We computed the PRS as previously published and categorized it by quintiles based on values previously used with InterLymph controls. The middle quintile served as the reference category. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for age at consent, sex, and socioeconomic status. In addition, we compared the median PRS by low-count MBL and high count MBL using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results We identified 276 MBLs overall and 2109 controls; 97% (N=267) of MBLs had low-count MBL and only 3% (N=9) had high-count MBL. We then selected 844 controls frequency matched to the MBL cases on age and sex. Family history of leukemia/lymphoma was 11.3% among MBLs overall and 8.8% among controls. The median PRS was 7.88 and 7.46 (Figure) among MBLs overall and controls, respectively. The continuous PRS had a 1.75-fold increased risk for MBL overall (CI:1.5-2.1, P=2.65x10 -12 ). Compared to the middle quintile, the highest quintile had 2.2-fold increased risk for MBL overall (CI:1.5-3.3, P=1.46x10 -4 ) and the lowest quintile had 0.6-fold decreased risk (CI:0.4-0.96, P=0.03). The median PRS for low-count and high count MBL were 7.86 and 8.04, respectively. The continuous PRS had a 1.75-fold increased risk for low-count MBL (CI:1.5-2.1, P=4.81x10 -12 ) and a 1.89-fold increased risk for high-count MBL (CI:0.8-4.2, P=0.13), however, the effect is not statistically significant between high-count and low-count MBL (P=0.89). Conclusion In this independent sample, we validated our previous findings that the CLL PRS is associated with MBL risk. Although the sample size of high-count MBL was limited (N=9), there is evidence of a weak trend towards a higher PRS compared to low-count MBL and controls Larger sample size of high-count MBL is warranted in order to stratify MBL risk by low-count and high-count MBL. These results may help identify individuals at higher risk of MBL including low-count and high-count MBL, beyond the risk associated with age and family history of CLL.
