    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4507 A 53 years old male started in February 2010 with ecchymosis, petechiae and spontaneous gum bleeding. He was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and was started on HYPER-CVAD, in combination with anti-tumoral lysis syndrome measures and antimicrobial, antiviral y antifungal prophylaxis. After finishing HYPER-CVAD phase A, he developed severe myelosuppression even with the use of G-CSF, 72 hours later he presented with abdominal cramping, fever up to 38.2\u00b0C and hypotension, with a high clinical suspicion of neutropenic colitis; his mean arterial pressure average was 45 mmHg, he was started on intravenous colloids, dobutamine and norepinephrine drips. Because of severe myelosuppression, septic shock and myocardial depression, a granulocyte transfusion without previous mobilization was performed with an identical sibling donor with concomitant use of granulocytic colony stimulation factor. Severe myelosuppression was maintained during 7 days, however shock state was reversed some hours after performing granulocyte transfusion, without infectious signs, 36 hours later a mononuclear cell infusion was performed from the same donor, with previous 2 days G-CSF mobilization. A gradual increase in leukocyte number appeared, with 400, 900 and finally 1900. A new bone marrow aspiration was performed, where hematopoietic recovery was confirmed from his sister's cells with confirmation by karyotype and microsatellites. He was then considered bone marrow grafted HLA compatible. On April 2010 he presented with acute diarrheic syndrome secondary to a CMV infection, he was started on ganciclovir and intravenous immunoglobulin. On May he presented an Aspergillus pneumonia that was treated both clinically with antifungal therapy and surgically with thoracoscopy to remove the fungi lesion. On October 2010 he started with graft versus host manifestations on the skin and in the liver. He started immunosuppressive treatment with Prednisone and Sirolimus. On November he developed anogenital herpes zoster infection. After this complication, every GVHD manifestation ceded. Now, 28 months post-bone marrow transplant he presents full remission with no evidence of leukemia. Granulocyte transfusion is an uncommon technique. Preferably it should be done with and identical donor. In this case report, the justification of the procedure was to be able to achieve a remission from a potentially irreversible septic shock; this was successfully done, in an unexpected clinical scenario with severe life threatening, and in a casual manner, the patient achieved a successfully bone marrow transplant, and now 30 months post-granulocyte infusion the patient is free from any evidence of disease.
