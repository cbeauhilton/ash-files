    "abstract_text": "Introduction The French health agency granted access to KTE-X19 in its early access program (French ATUs) for patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL) who failed after at least one line of chemoimmunotherapy and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. DESCAR-T is the French national registry for all patients treated with CAR-T cells (commercial or early access program). DESCAR-T designed and sponsored by LYSA/LYSARC aims to collect \"real-life\" data about CAR-T cell eligible patients in all hematological malignancies. We report the first results of \"real-life\" use of KTE-X19 in R/R MCL. Methods. All patients with MCL and registered in DESCAR-T were eligible for the present study. The data collection started at time of the medical decision to treat with KTE-X19. All patients gave informed consent before DESCAR-T registration. Response was determined by investigators per the Lugano criteria. CAR-T cells were monitored in peripheral blood samples of 14 patients by multiparametric flow cytometry routine procedures, using the biotinylated CD19 CAR detection reagent (Miltenyi Biotec\u00a9). Results Our study started at the beginning of the French early access program on January 7 th 2020 until data extraction on June 18 th 2021. A total of 57 patients were registered, including 6 commercial use registrations of KTE-X19 (after the end of early access program). KTE-X19 product has been ordered for 55 patients of whom 47 have been infused with CAR-T cells. KTE-X19 was not ordered in 2 cases because of patient decision. It was not infused in 8 patients because of disease progression (n=3), manufacturing failure (n=3), cardiac disease (n=1) and uncontrolled infection (n=1). At the time of registration in DESCAR-T, median age of infused patients was 67 years (range 45-79), 93.6% of patients were male. Median number of prior lines of treatment was 3 (range 2-8) with 34% of autologous stem cell transplant. Initial Ki67 was high (>30%) in 78.6% of patients, 52.4% of patients had elevated LDH and 21.1% had a poor performance status (PS\u22652) at inclusion.Median time between CAR-T order and infusion was 56 days (range 35-134) and 87.2% of patients had a bridging therapy. Median follow-up since CAR-T administration was 3.3 months (range 0-12.6). The best overall response rate for the 42 patients with at least one efficacy evaluation was 88%, including CR in 61.9%. PFS calculated from KTE-X19 infusion at 6 months was 57.9% (Figure A) and median duration of 5.3 months. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was observed in 78.7% of patients and a neurotoxicity in 48.9%. Transfer in ICU was needed in 27.7% of patients, with a median duration of hospitalization of 5 days. CRS or neurotoxicity of \u2265 grade 3 were seen in 4 patients (8.5%), one patient presented both AEs. Among the 47 infused patients, 5 died, 4 of progressive disease and 1 of grade 5 CRS. Cellular kinetics parameters including area under the curve (AUC) representing the exposure from day 0 to day 28 (Figure B), maximal expansion post infusion (C MAX, Figure C) and time to maximal expansion (T MAX, Figure D) are shown. We observed a statistical trend to a shorter T MAX in responders. Conclusion This first analysis of \"real-life\" use of KTE-X19 supports results of clinical trials using CAR-T cells in R/R MCL. The safety profile and the overall response rate are also in line with previously published data. Taken together, the present \"real-life\" study experience supports the use of KTE-X19 in R/R MCL who failed after BTKi. Updated results will be presented at the meeting.
