    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1411 Glucocorticoids (GC), such as prednisolone and dexamethasone, are an integral component of the multi-agent treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). GC-resistance is a significant prognostic indicator of a poor treatment outcome and remains a clinical problem, with the underlying mechanisms still unclear. Mutation or loss of the primary mediator of GC-action, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), underlies the GC-resistant phenotype in several commonly used leukemic cell lines. However, these events are rare in primary leukemic cells, with relatively few examples in vivo . This suggests that it may be possible to reverse the GC-resistant phenotype pharmacologically. We have used an iTRAQ proteomics approach for hypothesis generation of potential mechanisms for GC-resistance in childhood ALL. To achieve this, we compared a well-characterized GC-sensitive cell line, PreB 697, and a GC-resistant sub-clone (R3F9), both bearing wildtype GR , in a comparative proteomic experiment using 4-channel isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). A comparison of protein profiles before and after dexamethasone exposure of the two cell lines identified two transcription factors involved in B-cell differentiation, PAX5 and IRF4, to be differentially upregulated in the PreB 697 compared to the R3F9 cell line in response to GC. Experimentally, there was approximately 50% reduction in PAX5 basal protein expression in R3F9 compared to its GC-sensitive parent, a finding which was also evident in four other resistant sub-lines. This was accompanied by a decreased expression of CD19 and CD10, indicative of an increased B-cell maturation state. The reduced PAX5 level in the GC-resistant cell lines was not due to mono-allelic loss or mutation and mRNA levels were not significantly altered, suggestive of a post-transcriptional mechanism for PAX5 protein reduction. Paradoxically, knockdown of PAX5 reversed the GC-resistant phenotype of the R3F9 cell line such that the apoptotic response to dexamethasone was similar to that of the GC-sensitive parent line as measured by Annexin V staining (R3F9: mean 52.22%, SD 12.54%, n=3; PreB 697: mean 67.23%, SD 9.96%, n=3) and cell viability assays. This chemosensitization after PAX5 knockdown was specific to GC, with no difference in cell viability observed in either cell line after exposure to daunorubicin, vincristine or L-asparaginase when compared to negative siRNA or mock controls. This increase in GC-sensitivity was coupled with a significant upregulation of GR and its transcriptional target, GILZ. We also showed an enhanced GC response after PAX5 knockdown in two out of eight primary, diagnostic pre-B lineage ALL patient samples. Thus, in this ALL cell line model, quantitative proteomic analysis revealed increased maturation as a recurrent mechanism underlying GC-resistance and identifies PAX5 as a possible therapeutic target to fully re-sensitise GC-response in childhood ALL.
