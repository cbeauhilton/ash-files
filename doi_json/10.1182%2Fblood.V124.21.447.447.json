    "abstract_text": "The deacetylation of histone and non-histone proteins by histone deacetylase (HDACs) plays a critical role in gene transcription and many other cellular processes in eukaryotic cells. Class II deacetylase HDAC6 is mainly localized in the cytoplasm and deacetylates tubulin and other cytoplasmic proteins. Earlier studies from our laboratory showed that HDAC6 can be transported to the nucleus, and can interact and deacetylate nuclear proteins, such as histones. In this study, we investigate the function of HDAC6 during erythroid differentiation. In proerythroblast cells, HDAC6 is detected in the nucleus and gradually migrates to the cytoplasm upon the induction of differentiation, indicating different HDAC6 functions during erythropoiesis. Inhibition of HDAC6 in mouse fetal liver erythroblasts impairs differentiation and enucleation. \u03b2-globin gene transcription is reduced by HDAC6 specific inhibitor, Tubastatin A, in cultured fetal erythroblasts. HDAC6 knockout mice also showed impaired globin gene transcription. HDAC6 specifically interacts with serine 2 phosphorylated Pol II and is recruited mainly at the transcribed region of \u03b2-globin, correlating with RNA Pol II recruitment. These results suggest that HDAC6 promotes erythroblast differentiation through the regulation of transcription elongation. HDAC6 also plays a role in regulating the enucleation process during the late stage of erythropoiesis. The formation of the contractile actin ring is disrupted and the enucleation process is blocked in cultured mouse fetal erythroblasts treated with the HDAC6 inhibitor. We further investigated the molecular mechanism of HDAC6 regulated enucleation. We found that HDAC6 interacts with and deacetylates mDia2, an effector of Rho GTPases that is required for erythroblast enucleation. Deacetylation of mDia2 is required for the formation of the contractile actin ring and subsequent enucleation. Altogether, our results identify the important role of HDAC6 in regulating transcription and enucleation during the different stages of mammalian erythropoiesis.
