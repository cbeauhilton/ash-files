    "abstract_text": "Purpose: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is characterized by a t(11;14) resulting in overexpression of cyclin D1, a member of the phosphatidylinosital 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway. This study tested whether CCI-779, which inhibits the PI3K pathway at the level of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) could produce tumor responses in patients (pts) with MCL. Patients and Methods: Eligible pts had biopsy-proven, cyclin D1 positive MCL and had relapsed or were refractory to therapy. Pts received CCI-779 250 mg IV every week as a single agent. Pts were re-staged after 1 cycle (4 doses) and every 3 cycles thereafter. Pts with a tumor response after 6 cycles were eligible to continue drug for a total of 12 cycles or 2 cycles after complete remission (CR) and then were observed. Results: Thirty-five pts were enrolled and evaluable for toxicity; 1 patient had MCL by histology but was cyclin D1 negative and ineligible for efficacy evaluation. The median age was 70 years (range, 38\u201389), 91% were stage 4, and 69% had \u2265 2 extranodal sites. Pts had received a median of 3 prior therapies (range, 1\u201311) and 54% were refractory to their last treatment. The overall response rate was 38% (13/34) with 1 CR (3%) and 12 PRs (35%), surpassing the pre-defined criteria for a promising agent. Responses tended to occur rapidly with median time to response of 1 month (range, 1\u20138). To date, 26 patients have progressed, with a median time-to-progression of 6.8 months (95% CI: 3.8 \u2013 9.7). Median duration of response for the 13 responders was 5.7 months (95% CI: 5.2 \u2013 13.2). Overall, 32 out of 35 patients who received treatment had grade 3 or 4 toxicity. The most common toxicities were hematologic with grade 3 (n=24) or grade 4 (n=4). Thrombocytopenia was the most frequent grade 3/4 toxicity (n=25) and the largest cause of dose-reductions, although counts typically recovered within one week. Only 4 patients could tolerate sustained 250 mg per week throughout their treatment (including one who went on to alternate treatment after 1 cycle) and the median dose/month was 175 mg. Conclusions: Single-agent CCI-779 has substantial anti-tumor activity in relapsed MCL. This study demonstrates that agents, which selectively target cellular pathways dysregulated in MCL cells can produce therapeutic benefit. The high response rate warrants further studies of this agent in MCL, but the high incidence of hematologic toxicity suggests that a lower dose should be explored. CCI-779 at 25mg is currently being evaluated in MCL through an NCCTG trial",
