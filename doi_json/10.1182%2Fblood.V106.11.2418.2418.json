    "abstract_text": "We have previously reported that agents that inhibit ATP binding and chaperone function of hsp90 are highly active against wild type and mutant Bcr-Abl and mutant FLT-3 containing human acute leukemia cells. In the present studies, we determined the effects of a more soluble and potent geldanamycin analogue, DMAG (Kosan Biosciences Inc.), and/or hydroxamate histone deacetylase inhibitor (HHDI), vorinostat (Merck & Co., Inc.), against human MCL Jeko1 and MO2058 cells. These cells contain the characteristic MCL-associated chromosomal translocation t(11; 14)(q13;q32), which results in the overexpression of cyclin D1. Recently, HHDIs, such as vorinostat, have been shown to inhibit HDAC6, which results in the acetylation of hsp90 and inhibition of its ATP binding and chaperone function. Treatment with vorinostat (0.5 to 2.0 \u03bcM) induced the accumulation of the cells in the G1 and DMAG (0.1 to 0.5 \u03bcM) in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Both agents induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (up to 50%). While vorinostat induced both p21 and p27 levels, DMAG only increased the intracellular levels of p21. Treatment with either agent depleted the intracellular levels of c-Myc, c-Raf, Akt and cdk4 in a dose dependent manner. It is well established that the chaperone association with hsp90 maintains Akt, c-Raf, cyclin D1 and cdk4 in the native and active conformation, and inhibition of hsp90 promotes their polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. Notably, co-treatment with DMAG (e.g., 0.25 \u03bcM) and vorinostat (e.g., 2.0 \u03bcM), more than either agent alone, markedly attenuated the levels of cyclin D1 and cdk4, as well as the levels of c-Myc, c-Raf and Akt. The combination of DMAG and vorinostat also induced significantly more apoptosis of Jeko1 and MO2058 cells, as compared to the treatment with either agent alone (p < 0.01). These findings demonstrate that the combined treatment with vorinostat and DMAG is highly active against human MCL cells, and support the rationale to determine the in vivo efficacy and safety of the combination against human MCL.",
