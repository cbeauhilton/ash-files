    "abstract_text": "MK-0457 (VX-680) is a small molecule inhibitor of aurora kinases A, B, and C, FLT3, and JAK-2 with nanomolar level broad spectrum pre-clinical anti-tumor activity. The T315I BCR-ABL mutation mediates high level resistance to imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib. MK-0457 has in vitro activity against cells expressing wild-type or mutated BCR-ABL, including the T315I BCR-ABL mutation. A Phase I study of MK-0457 is being conducted in patients with refractory hematologic malignancies. The study regime is a 5-day continuous IV regimen given every 2 to 3 weeks. To date, dose levels of 8 (N=4), 12 (N=5), 16 (N=3), 20 (N=4), 24 (N=15), 28 (N=6), and 32 (N=3) mg/m 2 /hr have been investigated. No MK-0457-attributable extramedullary Grade 3 adverse events (AEs) have been observed to date, and thus, the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) has not yet been reached. Grade 1 nausea was observed in 1 patient each at the 12 and 24 mg/m 2 /hr levels, and there have been 4 patients with Grade 1 alopecia. Dose-proportional PK has been observed across dose levels. Myelosuppression is consistently seen with MK-0457 at all dose levels studied to date and appears dose-related. Of 40 patients on study to date, 15 had CML, 2 had ALL, 13 had acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 10 had rapidly progressive or transforming MPD. A nested PCR strategy followed by direct DNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method was used to detect and monitor mutations in codons 221 to 500 of the BCR-ABL kinase domain in CML and ALL patients. Of 15 patients with CML, 11 had a T315I BCR-ABL mutation as had 1 of 2 ALL patients. Of 14 currently evaluable patients with CML, 11 had an objective (hematologic, cytogenetic, and/or molecular) response, including all 11 patients with the T315I mutation. The patient with T315I-mutant ALL also had an objective response. Six of 8 currently evaluable patients with JAK-2 positive refractory MPD have achieved an objective response. Downregulation of BCR-ABL and CrkL phosphorylation in leukemia cells from CML and ALL patients treated on study has been documented \u2013 the possible role of aurora kinase inhibition in these clinical responses requires further investigation. Accrual to the study is ongoing at the 36 mg/m 2 /hr dose level. The currently reported cases are the first observed clinical activity of a kinase inhibitor against the T315I positive CML/ALL and JAK-2 positive MPD. The observation of responses in these patients to doses of MK-0457 associated with no significant toxicity warrants further study."
