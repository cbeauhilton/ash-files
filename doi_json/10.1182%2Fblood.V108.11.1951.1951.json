    "abstract_text": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of clofarabine, a novel deoxyadenosine analog, in adult patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia and in selected elderly patients with untreated AML and heart disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a phase II, open-label trial, 23 patients with de-novo AML, AML evolved from MDS or relapsed AML received a 5 day regimen consisting of clofarabine 40 mg/m 2 intravenously over 1 hour followed within 4 hours by Ara-C 1000 mg/m 2 . The median age was 68 years (range 39\u201379 years). Fifteen (65%) had received at least one prior cytotoxic regimen (excluding 5-AZA). Significant cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction, bypass grafting, cardiomyopathy) was present in 52% (12/23) prior to therapy. RESULTS: 22/23 received at least one cycle of therapy and 5 received 2 cycles. One early death was due to disease progression. Grade 4 neutropenia developed in all patients. There were no cases of regimen-related cardiac toxicity. Most patients had some degree of edema and third-spacing syndrome. Several developed a significant but reversible acral rash. 20 patients are evaluable for response. The histologic response rate (defined as marrow blasts <5%) is 60% (12/20) consisting of 10 (50%) complete remissions and 2 (10%) partial responses. Complete cytogenetic remissions occurred in 9 patients. Durable remissions and low toxicity allowed some patients to proceed to nonablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSION: Clofarabine (40mg/m 2 ) and Ara-C (1000mg/m 2 ) x 5 days is an active and well tolerated regimen in myeloid malignancies including \u201celderly AML\u201d\u2014a distinct entity usually associated with poor response rate and high treatment-related toxicities. Other drug combinations with clofarabine are being explored for use in allogeneic transplant regimens and with other high-risk patient groups.",
