    "abstract_text": "Neutrophil-specific granule deficiency (SGD) is a rare congenital disorder. Neutrophils of SGD patients show abnormal bilobed nuclei and lack secondary and tertiary granule gene expression. Since neutrophils of SGD patients are deficient for bactericidal activity, the patients display immunodeficiency and suffer from frequent and severe infections. The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein epsilon (C/EBP\u03b5) is one of the major regulators of granulopoiesis and is known to be the responsible gene for the disease. At least two homozygous germline mutations (5bp deletion and A-nucleotide insertion) of C/EBP\u03b5, which are functionally defective, have been reported. Here, we report a novel in-frame deletion of the C/EBP\u03b5 gene in a 55 years-old female patient with a life-long history of recalcitrant skin infections with ulcer and scar formation. Peripheral blood smear showed characteristic changes, including reduction of cytoplasmic granules and increased bilobed nuclei of the neutrophils, monocytosis, absence of eosinophils and increased basophils. Flow cytometric examination revealed significant reduction of CD16 and abnormal expression of CD14 on the neutrophil surface. Sequencing of the C/EBP\u03b5 gene revealed a homozygous deletion of 6 base-pairs (arginine and serine residues deletion; \u0394RS) within the leucine zipper domain. Activation of luciferase driven by G-CSF receptor promoter was not induced by \u0394RS; and endogenous expression of granule genes, including B9, NGAL and lactoferrin, was induced by wild-type C/EBP\u03b5 but not by \u0394RS in NIH3T3 cells, suggesting that transcriptional activity of \u0394RS was diminished. GFP-tagged \u0394RS, as well as wild-type C/EBP\u03b5, were localized to the nucleus in NIH3T3 cells, and DNA binding activity of \u0394RS, which was determined by biotin-labeled DNA pulldown assay, was intact. Meanwhile, \u0394RS together with Gata1 and PU.1 were not able to induce expression of eosinophil major basic protein (MBP) in NIH3T3 cells. Of note, wild-type C/EBP\u03b5 associated with Gata1; however, \u0394RS did not interact with Gata1, indicating that the \u0394RS likely impairs protein-protein interaction of other transcription factors resulting in loss of transcriptional activation. These results further support the importance of the leucine zipper domain of C/EBP\u03b5 for its essential function and indicate multiple molecular mechanisms leading to SGD.
