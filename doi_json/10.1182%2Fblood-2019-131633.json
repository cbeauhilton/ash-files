    "abstract_text": "Several therapeutic approvals in recent years have resulted in a change in the paradigm for standard treatment of patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory (r/r) AML. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) was resurrected in 2017 for CD33+ newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory AML using a safer fractionated dosing regimen. Since its re-approval it has been incorporated in combination with standard 7+3 (cytarabine 100mg/m2 + daunorubicin 60mg/m2; Castaigne S et al, Lancet 2012) as upfront therapy for good and intermediate risk AML patients (pts) treated at institutions with access to rapid risk stratification (molecular/cytogenetic results) including ours (Roswell Park; RP). In the five randomized studies of GO combinations for newly diagnosed AML, varied doses of cytarabine and anthracyclines were used (Lancet Oncol, 2014). In these, cytarabine doses ranged from (100-200 mg/m 2 ), daunorubicin doses ranged from 45-60 mg/m 2 . These studies did not intensify daunorubicin beyond 60mg/m2 and did not incorporate FLT3 inhibitors. Previous work has demonstrated that anthracycline dose intensification (90mg/m 2 ) provides a recognized survival advantage for younger AML pts (Luskin MR et al, 2016.), particularly those with mutations in FLT3 . Optimal combination approach(s) including GO for the management of patient with AML are unclear. Adaptation of GO in combination with 7+3 for upfront AML management has led to the evolution of institutional standards to optimize early identification of good/intermediate risk AML pts. Unfortunately, there is limited data on the safety and efficacy of higher doses of daunorubicin in combination with GO and/or FLT3 inhibitors. Here we present outcomes and adverse events (AEs) using varied upfront treatment regimens in combination with GO at RP. We additionally present a cohort of r/rAML pts treated with GO alone or in combinations under an expanded access protocol (NCT02312037) at RP prior to re-approval in 2017. R/R AML pts treated on expanded access had AEs collected prospectively, all other cases were identified by retrospective chart review in accordance to IRB approval. 218 patients with a diagnosis of AML and a median age of 66.5 years were seen at RP since GO approval. Of these all good risk and 45% of intermediate risk AML underwent induction chemotherapy. During 2015-2017 r/rAML patients were treated with GO based therapy (N=32) on NCT02312037 trial. Since FDA approval another 48 pts have been treated with GO at our institution. Of the 80 patients in this cohort, N=25 underwent GO based induction therapy (Table 1). The most frequently used other combinations were: (i) daunorubicin 60mg/m 2 and cytarabine 200mg/m 2 (N=17), (ii) daunorubicin 90mg/m 2 + cytarabine 100mg/m 2 , N=4), (iii) FLAG-GO (used in patients with cardiac comorbidities; N=2) and hypomethylating agents combined with GO (N=10), monotherapy was used in 45 pts. The ORR (CR+Cri) for patients treated with GO based induction was 88%. The overall (OS) and event free survival (EFS) were 48 and 17 months for induction-treated pts respectively. The most common AEs were febrile neutropenia (60%), infusion reactions (30%), transaminitis (20%), cytopenias beyond 30 days from induction (10%). The most common reason for change of therapy was disease progression. Toxicity was not higher in those patients receiving higher doses (>60mg/m2) of daunorubicin or cytarabine (200mg/m2). Two patients received GO+7+3+FLT3 inhibitors; this was well- tolerated in a very small sample. In the R/R cohort, pts received a median of 2 cycles of therapy, the ORR was 18%. GO had no activity in those treated with >2 prior regimens for relapsed disease. In conclusion, anthracycline intensification as part of a 7+3 combination with GO was not associated with increased toxicity. Although the number was small, FLT3 inhibitors following 7+3+GO were also well tolerated. These data require confirmation in a larger cohort. Our results confirm the EFS reported in the literature (18 months in ALFA 0701 study), and suggest a higher mean OS of 40 months compared with conventional 7+3 induction. The response rate for GO monotherapy in r/rAML is low and was exceedingly poor for heavily pretreated pts.
