    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4960 Introduction: Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder with a proclivity for extranodal involvement, including the lungs, brain, kidney, liver, and skin. It usually affects middle-age adults, with male predominance (M:F ratio >2:1). Its association with EBV (Epstein Barr Virus) infection has been described. Objectives: To present our experience of 8 cases of lymphomatoid granulomatosis at Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) in the last 10 years. Results: We collected the data of 8 cases of lymphomatoid granulomatosis that were diagnosed and treated at MCC from January 2000 to January 2011. The median follow up was 7.5 months. Five out 8 (63%) cases were males. The median age was 65. 3/8 (12.5%) had a performance status (PS) more than 2. 4/8 (50%) of cases had elevated LDH. All patients (100%) had an Ann Arbor Stage IVE. The IPI (International Prognostic Index) was more than high-intermediate in 6/8 (75%) cases. 4/8 (50%) of cases were positive for EBV. 6/8 (75%) have received chemotherapy to date, most commonly R+CHOP. The median time to progression was 8.6 months (1-8 months) following the first treatment and was shorter after the second treatment (4.8 months). 2/8 (25%) are disease free after chemotherapy, all remaining patients have active disease. 2/8 (25%) have died at 7 and 13 months after diagnosis. Conclusions: Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare lymphoproliferative disease. In our experience it presents as an advanced and high risk disease. Interestingly, EBV was found in only 50% of cases. The overall response to standard chemotherapy is suboptimal and further strategies are needed for optimal management. These might include aggressive chemotherapy and up front stem cell transplantation. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
