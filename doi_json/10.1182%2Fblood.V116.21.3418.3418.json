    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3418 Introduction: Mobilisation and collection of in vivo-purged CD34+ stem cells for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients while in complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR) may offer a therapeutic option for those who develop resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM), the recommended first line therapy. Indeed, several groups have reported on retrospective studies showing autologous stem cell mobilisation to be safe and efficacious during IM therapy. However, assessing the clinical utility of managing patients using this approach is difficult as long-term follow-up is lacking. Here, we report the clinical outcome for 22 CML patients with a median of 99.5 months follow-up post G-CSF induced stem cell mobilisation. We assessed the efficacy and the the impact on BCR-ABL1 expression levels in these individuals. Material and Methods: Stem cell mobilisation was achieved by administering 10 mg/kg body weight (bw)/day filgrastim (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, G-CSF) subcutaneously. Stem cell apheresis was performed if the absolute number of circulating CD34+ cells exceeded 5/ml. Target stem cell yield was 3 2\u00d710 6 CD34+ cells/kg body weight. BCR-ABL1 transcripts were quantified by real time PCR (Q-PCR) of reverse transcribed total RNA using LightCycler\u00ae with \u03b2-actin as endogenous control gene. Results: For the twenty-two patients included in the present study, median age was 47 years (range, 24 \u2013 71) and median disease duration was 20 months (range, 1 \u2013 77). At the start of IM, 19 patients were in chronic phase (CP), and 3 in accelerated phase (AP). With a median duration on IM of 16 months (range, 2 \u2013 29), time to first CCyR was 6 months (range, 0 \u2013 25) and time from CCyR to apheresis was 8.5 months (range, 1 \u2013 20). Mobilisation was performed once in 16 patients and twice in 6 patients, of whom eighteen patients (82 %) proceeded to apheresis. Overall, mobilisation was successful in 17 of 22 patients (78 %) with a median CD34+ cell number of 3.1\u00d710 6 /kg body weight (range, 0,7 - 6). BCR-ABL1 transcripts were undetectable in 12 of 22 peripheral blood samples (55 %) at the time of apheresis and 7 of 14 stem cell harvests (50 %) without discernible correlation with matched peripheral blood samples. Progression-free survival at 5 and 8 years was determined to be 63 %, and overall survival at 5 years and 8 years was 95 % and 90 %, respectively. Sixteen of 22 patients (73 %) continue to be treated with IM and twelve of 22 patients (55 %) are without detectable BCR-ABL1 transcripts, i.e. in complete molecular remission (CMR). Of the six patients that stopped IM (3 resistant and 3 intolerant), all received nilotinib as second-line TKI. Five of these six patients are still alive (1 in CHR; 1 in MCyR; 1 in MMR; and 2 in CMR), and one patient who subsequently received dasatinib died after progressing to blast crisis. Conclusion: These observations show G-CSF induced stem cell mobilisation and collection during IM therapy for autologous transplantation to be safe and efficient with a favourable long-term outcome.
