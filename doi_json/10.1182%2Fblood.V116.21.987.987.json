    "abstract_text": "Abstract 987 Background: IMiD\u00ae compounds are effective in immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis (AL), a systemic plasma cell disorder related to multiple myeloma (MM). Pomalidomide is a new IMiD\u00ae compound. Methods: Persons with symptomatic, biopsy-proved, previously-treated AL were eligible for treatment with pomalidomide if they had measurable hematologic disease, ECOG PS\u22652, adequate hematologic reserve and creatinine \u22642.5 mg/dL. Pomalidomide, 2 mg/d, and dexamethasone, 40 mg/w, were given orally along with low-dose aspirin. Dose-escalation to 4 mg/d was allowed for non-responders. Exclusion-criteria were uncontrolled infection, cancer, NYHA classification >II, serum troponin-T >0.1 ng/mL, \u2265grade-3 neuropathy, thrombosis or other AL therapy within 2 weeks of enrollment. 31 subjects enrolled, but only 29 are evaluble for toxicity and response due to recent enrollment. Results: Median age was 66 y (range, 52 82 y); 19 were male. Median time from diagnosis to study-entry was 36 mo (range, 0.9\u2013104.1 mo). 24 had cardiac involvement, 10, renal involvement and 8, nerve involvement. Cardiac biomarker staging was: I, N=3, II, 21, and III, N=7. Subjects were extensively pretreated: 28 received an alkylator (including an autotransplant in 13), 15, prior lenalidomide or thalidomide and 12, prior bortezomib. 193 cycles of pomalidomide were given to 29 subjects. 11 subjects had protocol-specified dose-increases (no response) and 16, dose-reductions (AEs). 20 subjects had dexamethasone dose-reductions. \u2265Grade-3 AE's \u2265possibly attributed to therapy occurred in 21 subjects. 7 of these subjects had only hematologic AE's. Neutropenia was the most common severe AE (N=10); severe thrombocytopenia occurred in 2 subjects. Other grade-3/-4 AEs included infection/fever (N=3); fatigue (N=4), and pleural effusion, ascites/edema, and edema each in one patient. 1 subject each had dyspnea, increased creatinine, thrombosis, muscle weakness, atrial tachycardia, and diarrhea. There were 2 episodes of syncope attributed to AL rather than therapy. A subject died 5 d after beginning therapy presumably from cardiac AL. As of 7/27/010, median time on-study is 8.4 mo (range, 0.2\u201316.2 mo). 18 subjects discontinued therapy for: progression/death (N=9); consent withdrawal (N=4), AE (N=3) and physician choice (N=2). Overall hematologic response rate (N=29) is 38% (95% CI, 20\u201358%) There were 8 PRs and 3 VGPRs including 4 PRs and 2 VGPRs among 14 subjects failing prior lenalidomide and/or thalidomide. 3 subjects had confirmed organ responses (2 heart and 1 kidney) and 4 unconfirmed organ responses. 1 y survival and PFS are 77% (95% CI, 60\u201398) and 56% (95% CI, 36\u201385). Conclusion: These data suggest that pomalidomide could provide a safe and effective therapy in previously-treated persons with AL including those failing lenalidomide and/or thalidomide.
