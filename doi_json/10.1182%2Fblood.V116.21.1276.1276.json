    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1276 Reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) post allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) has shown to be controlled by the adoptive transfer of donor derived CMV-reactive T cells (CMV-T). A current method for the generation of CMV-T cells is CMV antigenic stimulation of donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), followed by isolation of interferon-gamma (IFN-g) secreting cells, by magnetic enrichment. The feasibility of generating a CMV-T cell product for clinical use, using PBMC from a G-CSF mobilised donor stem cell apheresis has yet to be fully determined. Small aliquots (<1ml) were taken from the mobilised apheresis of CMV positive donors (n=5), the PBMC separated using density gradient centrifugation and then stimulated in a 16 hour culture using a commercially available CMVpp65 peptide pool (Peptivator \u2013 Miltenyi Biotec). CMV-T cells were then isolated using both IFN-g secretion and expression of the activation marker CD25. Results were then compared directly against the same methods in non-mobilised PBMC. Figure 1 View large Download slide Figure 1 View large Download slide Close modal The proportion of CMVpp65 stimulated CD25+ T cells was equivalent between mobilised (53.15%) and non-mobilised (63.28%) PBMC. The CMV-T response was also predominantly CD4+ in both mobilised (98%) and non-mobilised (88%) PBMC. In contrast IFN-g secretion was shown to identify CMV-T in mobilised PBMC (41.77%), but this was consistently 50\u201360% lower in frequency compared to non-mobilised PBMC (95.59%). This 1\u20132 fold reduction in IFN-g+ T cell activation does not appear to effect the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells, which was comparable between mobilised (1:1.1) and non-mobilised (1:1.5) PBMC ( Figure 1  ) . Furthermore a reduction was observed in both yield (6.62% vs. 58.93%) and purity (35.68 vs. 76.01%) post enrichment of IFN-g+ CMV-T cells from mobilised PBMC. Of the IFN-g+ cells isolated from non-mobilised PBMC \u223c30% were also positive for CD25 whereas this number was undetectable (<1%) in the mobilised setting) ( Figure 2 a and b ). Figure 2a View large Download slide Figure 2a View large Download slide Close modal Figure 2b View large Download slide Figure 2b View large Download slide Close modal Enrichment of CD25+ CMV-T cells showed parity between mobilised and non-mobilised PBMC in terms of both yield (26.12% vs. 34.75%) and purity (89.92% vs. 93.39%). We have also observed that enrichment of CD25+ CMV-T cells depleted the naturally occurring CD25+ T cells seen in the unstimulated PBMC. Background expression of CD25 has been thought previously to be a barrier to selection of activated cells by CD25. However, CD25+ selections from non-stimulated cultures resulted in a yield of <1%. These results indicate that G-CSF can suppress the Ag-specific T cell responses following in vitro stimulation with a CMVpp65 peptide pool but CMV-T can still be detected and isolated. We hypothesise that the reduced IFN-g+ T cell activation in mobilised PBMC could be as a result of the suppressive nature of an increased frequency of FoxP 3 + IL-10 secreting T cells compared to that in non-mobilised PBMC. We have demonstrated G-CSF suppression of CMVpp65 stimulated T cell responses with reference to a type 1 cytokine profile. Both CD25+ and IFN-g+ CMV-T from mobilised and non-mobilised PBMC are being tested for secretion of a profile of type 1 and type 2 cytokines to include TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10. Direct selection of CMV-T by CD25 expression represents a potential approach for isolating these cells for clinical use.
