    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1703 The majority of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cases are characterized by the presence of a PML-RARA fusion gene. In a small subset, RARA is fused to a different partner including PLZF, NPM1, NuMA , STAT5b, PRKAR1A and FIP1L1 . Here we identified a novel RARA fusion transcript, BCOR-RARA in a t(X;17)(p11;q12) variant of APL. The patient was a 45-year-old man. Although the patient was clinically responsive to ATRA, repeated standard chemotherapy with ATRA did not effect a cure. The bone marrow promyelocytes had unique morphologic features, including rectangular and round cytoplasmic inclusion bodies . They were more granular than those of AML M2 but less granular than the classical t(15;17) APL. Flow cytometric analysis revealed strong expression of CD13, CD33, CD56, weak expression of CD11c and lack of HLA-DR and CD7. The karyotype analysis detected a novel chromosomal translocation described as 45,-Y, t(X;17)(p11.2;q12)[19]/ 46,XY[1]. FISH analysis indicated one intact and two split signals of RARA and two intact signals of PML. To amplify unknown chimeric fusion transcripts, we performed 5'-RACE. The sequence revealed that BCL6 co-repressor, BCOR cDNA from exons 9 to 12 to be fused to RARA exon 3. By RT-PCR, we confirmed full length chimeric fusion transcripts spanning from the start codon to 4,948 nt of BCOR cDNA (NM_001123384) fused to RARA cDNA from exon 3 to the stop codon. The chimeric cDNA had an in-frame codon from BCOR through RARA , creating a 1,931 amino acid fusion protein. One of the consistent features in all known RARA fusion partners is self-association. To determine whether BCOR-RARA self-associate, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays . These results showed that BCOR-RARA is able to self-associate both through the region of BCOR-S and the ankyrin repeat domain of BCOR. In addition, BCOR-RARA associated with BCL6. RXR recruitment is a critical determinant of transforming potential of oligomeric RARA fusion proteins. To investigate how BCOR-RARA associates with RARE in vitro , we performed EMSA. These results showed that BCOR-RARA/RXRA complex associates with RARE in an alternative manner compared to RARA and PML-RARA. Deregulation of RARA transcriptional activations has a central role in pathogenesis of APL. Therefore, we evaluated ATRA-induced transcriptional activation of 4\u00d7 RAREs with a reporter assay in HepG2 cells. Without ATRA, BCOR-RARA repressed the reporter activity. With addition of ATRA, BCOR-RARA induced transcriptional activation very weakly. Subsequently, we evaluated dominant-negative effects of the samples in the RARA/RXRA pathway. In contrast to BCOR, BCOR-RARA clearly inhibited ATRA-induced RARA transcriptional activation as well as PML-RARA. Furthermore, we asked which domains are sufficient for the dominant-negative effects with the deletion mutants. The results indicated that the region spanning from 999 to 1,409 aa of BCOR-RARA has pivotal roles in the dominant-negative effects. Correct protein function is highly dependent on intracellular localization. To investigate subcellular localization of BCOR-RARA, we performed immunofluorescence analysis in 293T cells. In BCOR-RARA - expressing cells, BCOR-RARA localized as two patterns; (I) diffusely in the nucleus as well as PML-RARA in 82% of the cells, (II) diffusely in the nucleus and aggregately in the cytoplasm in 18% of the cells. The subcellular localization of BCOR-RARA was clearly distinguishable from the punctuate pattern as shown in the nucleus of BCOR - expressing cells. Moreover, co-immunofluorescence analysis between BCOR-RARA and BCL6 indicated that the subcellular localization of BCOR-RARA/BCL6 is distinct from BCOR/BCL6. BCOR-RARA was found to possess common features with other RARA fusion proteins. These included: (I) the same break point in RARA cDNA; (II) self-association; (III) RXRA is necessary for BCOR-RARA to associate with the RARA responsive element; (IV) action in a dominant-negative manner on RARA transcriptional activation; (V) aberrant subcellular relocalization. It should be noted that there was no intact BCOR found in the 45,-Y,t(X;17)(p11;q12) APL cells because they featured only a rearranged \u00d7 chromosome. These results highlight essential features of pathogenesis in APL in more detail. BCOR appears to be involved not only in human congenital diseases but also in a human cancer.
