    "abstract_text": "Background: Drug-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) can be observed as an adverse event (AE) during the administration of dasatinib (DAS), which is a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). The occurence of DAS-induced PAH at a late onset in most of the cases suggests a chronic pathological mechanism rather than an acute inflammatory or cardiac etiology. The treatment strategies of DAS-induced PAH include the cessation of the drug and PAH-specific therapies. Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate the frequency, clinical features, management strategies and outcomes of patients with DAS-induced PAH among a cohort consisted of CML and Ph+ ALL patients who had received DAS as a salvage treatment after imatinib (IM) failure or intolerance. Patients and Methods: Forty patients with Ph+ leukemias who received second-line DAS were enrolled. Patients' demographics, Sokal risk scores, molecular and cytogenetic responses, comorbidities [including preexisting cardiac disease, renal insufficiency, hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)], DAS dose, dosing intervals and treatment durations, durations of IM therapy prior to DAS, and if any, treatments prior to IM (interferon (IFN), cytarabine (Ara-C), and hydroxyurea (HU)) and follow-up periods were noted retrospectively. TKI response criteria were based on the recommendations of European LeukemiaNet, and the definitions of the CML phases and responses were as described elsewhere. Results: Twenty-four patients were male, and the median age was 45 years (range, 18-81 years). There were 39 patients with CML and one with Ph+ ALL. Among the thirty-nine CML patients, 3 were in accelerated phase (CML-AP), two with blast crisis (CML-BC), and the rest were in chronic phase (CML-CP). The percentanges of low, intermediate, and high Sokal risk scores were 46%, 33%, and 21%, respectively. Thirteen patients received only IM prior to DAS, whereas the others had used HU, IFN and Ara-C prior to IM. After a median duration of 41.5 months (range, 1-93 months) of IM, the reason for switching to DAS were IM failure and intolerance in 37 and 3 patients, respectively. DAS was administered with a median of 50 months (range, 2-78 months). During DAS treatment hematological AEs were observed in 6 patients, whereas in twenty-one pulmonary complications including exacerbation of COPD and pneumonia (n=1), pleuro/pericaridal effusions (n=19), PAH (n=5) and gastrointestinal bleeding (n=1) were detected. DAS therapy was ceased in 13 patients, of which ten were switched to nilotinib (NIL) due to AEs (n=7) and failure (n=3). Also, two patients received cytotoxic treatment due to BC and one had allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Five patients (12.5%) had DAS-induced PAH (Table 1). Four of them were in CML-CP at diagnosis, and one was in CML-AP. All cases received DAS due to IM failure. At the time of DAS initiation, 4 cases were in CML-CP and one in CML-BC. PAH was diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in 3 patients, and by right heart catheterization (RHC) in 2, and it was observed after a median of 8 months (range, 2-25 months) of DAS. Three patients had accompanying pleuro/pericardial effusions. All patients with DAS-induced PAH were alive at the time of the analysis, and the management of PAH included dose reduction in two, and DAS was switched to NIL in 2 cases and allo-HSCT was performed in one. Conclusion: DAS-induced PAH seems to be reversible with the cessation and/or modification of DAS \u00b1 PAH-specific treatments. As pulmonary vascular toxicity related to DAS is thought to be molecule-related rather than class-related, it seems reasonable to switch to another TKI. The patients in our cohort had good responses to dose modification and drug cessation and none received PAH-specific therapy. Although DAS-induced PAH is mainly defined as a late complication, we detected that PAH can be observed even after 2 months of drug exposure. PAH can be observed during DAS treatment and physicians should be aware of this AE. Routine cardiopulmonary evaluation prior to and/or during DAS may be beneficial. Mechanisms under this pathological condition, preceding and prognostic factors, and treatment strategies are needed to be evaluated with prospective trials.
