    "abstract_text": "Therapy related Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (t-ALL) refers to ALL developed in patients who have received prior cytotoxic therapies, including chemotherapies (CT) and/or radiotherapy (RT). Contrary to therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, t-ALL has not been fully recognized and its clinical and biological features remain poorly described. We reviewed all consecutive cases of adult t-ALL treated at our institution and described their clinical, phenotypic, and genetic characteristics. Between 1998 and 2019, 36 patients were admitted at Institut Paoli-Calmettes for t-ALL which represents 3.5% of all ALL admitted during the same period (n=1036). Median age was 67.5 years (ranges, 20-83). Twenty-eight (78%) patients were females. Thirty-eight (78%) patients of the t-ALL were secondary to a solid cancer. Among the most frequent solid tumors, we found 14 (39%) breast cancers, 5 (14%) pulmonary cancers and 4 (11%) thyroid cancers. Eight patients had a t-ALL secondary to a hematological malignancy (4 Non-Hodgkin lymphomas, 3 Hodgkin lymphomas and one myeloma). Three (8%) patients presented with more than one primary cancer. Primary malignancies were treated with CT in 7 cases (19%), RT in 11 cases (31%) and CT+RT in 16 cases (44%), in association or not with surgery of the primary tumor. Median time between the start of first malignancy treatment and t-ALL diagnosis was 5.4 years (ranges, 0.3-35). Median white blood cell count (WBC) was 15.9 (ranges, 0.6-386). Phenotypic characteristics at diagnosis were consistent with B-ALL for 31 patients (86%), and T-ALL or acute mixed-lineage leukemia for 2 (6%) and 3 (8%) patients, respectively. 9 (22%) cases were Philadelphia chromosome-positive by karyotype or Fluorescent in situ hybridization, 5 (14%) cases had MLL rearrangement, 5 (14%) cases had hypodiploidy, 3 (8%) cases had hyperdiploidy and 3 (8%) cases had normal karyotype. The 11 (30%) other cases had other genetic abnormalities. Thirty-one (86%) patients received intensive CT and 5 (14%) patients received a palliative treatment. For one patient, treatment modalities were missing. Twenty-eight (78%) were in complete remission (CR) after CT and 7 (19%) patients underwent an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in first CR. Median follow-up was 52 months. Median overall survival calculated from the time of t-ALL diagnosis was 16 months and median leukemia-free survival was 14.3 months. Multivariate analyses taking age, WBC, MLL alteration, complex karyotype and BCR-ABL rearrangement into account, found that BCR-ABL alteration was associated with a higher OS (HR=4.9; ranges, 1.1-22.6). In conclusion, our results confirm that t-ALL is a rare event. Besides an older age at diagnosis, t-ALL does not display specific phenotypic or genetic characteristics. In our series, the patient outcome was poor. Further genetic studies are needed to better understand the pathogenesis of this ALL subgroup. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
