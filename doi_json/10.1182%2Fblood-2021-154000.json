    "abstract_text": "Background: N-terminal myristoylation is the transfer of the saturated fourteen carbon fatty acid myristate to an N-terminal glycine residue. This co- or post-translational protein modification promotes protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions and is essential for proper membrane localization and/or activity of up to 600 human intracellular proteins. N-myristoyltransferases (NMTs) are the enzymes responsible and two isoforms are found in humans. NMT1 (ubiquitous and essential for cell survival) and NMT2 (more variably expressed) differ in activity level and substrate specificities. NMT expression levels vary in some cancers, and with myristoylation being essential for activity of certain oncogenes including Src Family Kinases (SFKs). NMTs have therefore been proposed as an anti-cancer target. Dysregulation and oncogenic activity of SFKs occurs frequently in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), suggesting NMT inhibition could provide therapeutic benefit. PCLX-001 is a low nanomolar small molecule pan-NMT inhibitor with high oral bioavailability in clinical trials as once daily oral therapy for lymphoma and solid tumors. Methods and Results: Data from the TCGA Transcriptome database showed high NMT1 and low NMT2 were associated with reduced overall and event-free survival in adult AML, and high NMT1 - but not NMT2 - expression is associated with proliferative gene sets in AML cell lines. AML cell lines treated with PCLX-001 showed a significant reduction in total protein myristoylation, as well as reduced levels of SFK proteins and SFK phosphorylation. PCLX-001 induced apoptosis in AML cell lines and patient blasts at concentrations which spared a large proportion of peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes from healthy individuals. AML cell lines showed significant increase in BIP protein and ER stress in response to PCLX-001, along with caspase 3 cleavage. In an AML cell line derived xenograft (CDX) and two AML patient derived xenograft (PDX) series (n=1 DX for MV-4-11 and n=2 PDX), PCLX-001 monotherapy had dose-dependent anticancer activity and resulted in complete remissions in subcutaneous AML cell deposits. In tail-vein injection PDX models, PCLX-001 treatment resulted in up to 95% reduction of human CD45+ cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow. Conclusions : These findings validate NMT inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy for AML. PCLX-001 preferentially targeted AML cells that rely on oncogenic activity of myristoylated proteins, inducing apoptosis and reducing leukemic burden. PCLX-001 warrants evaluation in clinical trials for adult AML. Disclosures Gamma:  Pacylex Pharmaceuticals: Current holder of individual stocks in a privately-held company.
