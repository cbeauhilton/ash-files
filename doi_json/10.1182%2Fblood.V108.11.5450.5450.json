    "abstract_text": "ASCT has been reported as a feasible, safe and effective treatment in HIV associated lymphoma patients (pts) receiving Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART). Nevertheless comparative studies with HIV\u2212 lymphoma population have not yet been performed. We present a retrospective matched analysis comparing clinical outcomes in both HIV+ and HIV\u2212 auto-transplanted HL pts. Patients and Methods: 6 HIV+ HL pts who underwent ASCT since June 2000 were included. Twelve transplanted HIV\u2212 HL auto-transplanted pts were selected as controls. Both groups (HIV+ vs HIV\u2212) were comparable for the most relevant clinical features (Mann-Whitney or chi-square tests p value > 0.05): median age (40 vs 36), Ann Arbor advanced stage (50% vs 25%), status at ASCT (CR>1 or PR, 83% vs 75%), all 18 pts received 2 lines of chemotherapy before ASCT. BEAM was used as conditioning regimen in all 18 pts. In the HIV+ group HAART was maintained during mobilization and ASCT, except during the conditioning in 1 Pt, in which it was needed to be resumed due to an increase in viral load. The median number of infused CD34+ cells/kg was 3,65\u00d710 6 in HIV+ pts and 4,75\u00d710 6 CD34+ in HIV\u2212 pts (p: NS). G-CSF was used in all HIV+ pt until engraftment starting at a median of 5 days (d) after ASCT. Results: All 18 pts engrafted, at a median of 13,5 (9\u201329) d after ASCT in HIV+ pts and 14 (11\u201318) d in HIV- pts. The incidence of acute infectious and toxic events was not different in both groups. All pts developed neutropenic fever. Documented infections were (HIV+ vs HIV\u2212): Gram+ bacteraemia (2 vs 3), Gram\u2212 bacteraemia (1 vs 0), CMV antigenemia (2 vs 1). Pneumonia was documented in one pt from each group. One HIV+ pt showed grade II liver toxicity and grade II renal toxicity occurred in 1 HIV\u2212 pt. All events were succesfully resolved. In 4 out of 6 HIV+ pts, HAART was withdrawn due to gastrointestinal toxicity. The median follow-up time was 36,5 mo in HIV+ pts and 37,5 mo in HIV\u2212 pts. Two pts relapsed in each group. Within the HIV+ group 1 pt died, due to disease progression. Within the HIV\u2212 group 3 pts died, 2 of disease progression and 1 due to post-ASCT secondary acute leukaemia. The OS at 36 mo was 83% for HIV+ pts and 80% for HIV\u2212 pts (p=NS). EFS at 36 mo was 55% in HIV+ pts and 70% in HIV\u2212 pt (p=NS). Conclusions: Our results show that clinical outcomes are comparable in HIV+ and HIV\u2212 HL pts undergoing ASCT. Engraftment, complication events and survival were not different. ASCT may be applied with guarantees in HIV associated HL on HAART pts in a similar way that in the HIV\u2212 setting.",
