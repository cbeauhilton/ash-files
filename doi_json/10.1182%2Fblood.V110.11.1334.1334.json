    "abstract_text": "Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), also known as interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP), is a transcription factor that expresses in T cells, B cells and macrophages and plays a role in myeloid development. Targeted deletion of IRF8 in mice (IRF8 \u2212/\u2212 ) induced progressive increase in the numbers of granulocytes in various lymphoid organs and development of a syndrome similar to human chronic myelogenous leukemia. In addition to defective development of macrophages and dendritic cells, B cell development was also impaired in IRF8 \u2212/\u2212 mice. This includes decreased numbers of early B cells, expanded marginal zone (MZ) B cells and diminished follicular (OF) B2 cells. Because abnormal myeloid cells could alter microenvironment required for normal B cell development, we have generated IRF8 conditional knockout mice to specifically investigate the function of IRF8 in B lineage cells. Mice were engineered to have exon 2, encoding the DNA binding domain of IRF8, flanked by loxP sites (designated IRF8 f/+ ). These mice were then crossed with the CD19Cre strain in which the expression of Cre-recombinase is controlled by the endogenous CD19 locus. Homozygous mice (designated (IRF8 f/f x Cre)F1) underwent germline excision of IRF8 in CD19 + B lineage cells. As a result, there was no detectable mRNA and protein of IRF8 in their splenic B cells. Flow cytometry analysis revealed expanded MZ B cells and reduced OF B2 cells in the spleen of (IRF8 f/f x Cre)F1 mice. Interestingly, the expression level of CD23 on OF B cells was significantly decreased in (IRF8 f/f x Cre)F1 mice, indicating that IRF8 is required for maintaining a normal OF phenotype. In the peritoneum of (IRF8 f/f x Cre)F1 mice, while the numbers of B1a and B2 cells were slightly decreased, the number of B1b cells was slightly increased. Furthermore, BXH2 mice carrying a mutation (C915T) in the Icsbp1 gene exhibited similar expansion of MZ B cells and low expression of CD23 in OF B cells. Taken together, these analyses indicate that IRF8 is required for development of normal MZ and B2 cells.",
