    "abstract_text": "Introduction : FISH is able to recognize chromosomal deletions and translocations with a greater sensitivity than conventional cytogenetics. Specific abnormalities have been associated with prognosis. Initial observations suggest a poor outcome for patients with -17p13.1, chromosome 13 abnormalities (\u039413) and t(4;14)(p16.3;q32). In contrast a good outcome has been shown in some series for patients with t(11;14)(q13;q32). We analyzed the value of FISH in patients receiving high dose therapy . Patients and Methods : We studied by cIg-FISH 226 patients undergoing high dose therapy at Mayo Clinic between 1/1990 and 9/2001. All patients had a pretransplant cIg-FISH done on cytospin slides from marrow aspirates for t(11;14)(q13;q32), t(4;14)(p16.3;q32), and -17p13.1(p53). Information was available regarding \u039413 for all patients (+ in 52%). Results : The prevalence of the abnormalities were: t(11;14)(q13;q32) 17% ( n =197), t(4;14)(p16.3;q32) 13% ( n =153), and -17p13.1 11% ( n =168). The overall survival (OS)was significantly shortened in patients with t(4;14)(p16.3;q32) (18.2 vs. 43.3 mo, p=0.001) (figure) and patients with -17p13.1 (14.7 vs. 38.6 mo, p=.01). OS was not different for patients with the t(11;14)(q13;q32) (36.2 vs. 34.8 mo, p=ns). Likewise time to progression (TTP) was shortened in patients with t(4;14)(p16.3;q32) (8.5 vs 17.7 mo, p=.001) and -17p13.1 (8.3 vs. 16.2 mo, p=0.005). TTP was also not affected significantly by the t(11;14)(q13;q32) (20.7 vs. 14.9 mo, p=NS). To dissect the specific contribution of t(4;14)(p16.3;q32) we did a subset analysis of patients who also had \u039413, since 85% of patients with t(4;14)(p16.3;q32) are expected to have \u039413. Of 84 studied for both abnormalities 22 had both \u039413 and t(4;14)(p16.3;q32). The OS was significantly shorter in patients with both abnormalities versus those with \u039413 alone (26.6 vs. 18.2 months, p=0.001). When a multivariable analysis of the impact of \u039413 and t(4;14)(p16.3;q32) were placed into a Cox model the hazard function for t(4;14)(p16.3;q32) was greater than \u039413 (2.6 versus 1.6). \u039413 had only borderline significance in this model (p=0.06). Conclusion : We have been unable to corroborate the improved outcome after transplant for patients with t(11;14)(q13;q32). As has been reported in patients with conventional and high dose therapy -17p13(p53) and t(4;14)(p16.3;q32) have clinical importance for estimation of OS and TTP. In this patient group the t(4;14)(p16.3;q32) carried a greater adverse impact than did \u039413, and identifies a subset of patients whose time to progression is 8.5 months. These patients likely do not benefit from autologous transplant and are candidates for novel therapeutic approaches. Outcome  . Successful determination . Patients with translocation or deletion .
