    "abstract_text": "Background Crovalimab is a novel anti-human complement component 5 (C5) antibody engineered to significantly extend half-life and enable subcutaneous (SC) administration once every 4 weeks in C5-mediated diseases. Based on the promising results of the Phase I/II COMPOSER trial (NCT03157635; R\u00f6th et al. Blood . 2020), crovalimab is currently under investigation as a potential therapy for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a life-threatening disorder characterized by hemolytic anemia and thrombosis. Eculizumab and ravulizumab are C5 inhibitors currently approved for the treatment of patients with PNH, yet treatment limitations include breakthrough hemolysis due to unsustained C5 inhibition, lack of efficacy in patients with C5 mutational variants, and the treatment burden of regular intravenous (IV) infusions. Study Design and Methods The Phase III, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter COMMODORE 2 study (NCT04434092) is evaluating the efficacy and safety of crovalimab compared with eculizumab in patients aged \u2265 12 years with PNH not previously treated with complement inhibitors. Patients are randomized 2:1 to receive crovalimab or eculizumab (Figure 1). Two hundred patients in the crovalimab arm will receive a loading series of crovalimab (IV dose on Day 1, followed by weekly SC doses for 4 weeks starting on Day 2). This is followed by SC maintenance dosing every 4 weeks starting at Week 5. Patients in the eculizumab arm receive a weekly IV loading dose of eculizumab for the first 4 weeks, followed by IV maintenance dosing starting at Week 5 and then once every 2 weeks for 24 weeks. After 24 weeks of treatment, patients can continue crovalimab or switch from eculizumab to crovalimab if their physician determines this is in their best interest. The primary efficacy objective of COMMODORE 2 is to evaluate the noninferiority of crovalimab compared with eculizumab based on the co-primary endpoints of (1) the proportion of patients who achieve transfusion avoidance and (2) the proportion of patients with hemolysis control. Secondary efficacy objectives are to evaluate the noninferiority of crovalimab compared with eculizumab in regard to the (1) proportion of patients who experience breakthrough hemolysis, (2) proportion of patients who achieve stabilization of hemoglobin, and (3) mean change in fatigue, as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue questionnaire. The safety objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of crovalimab compared with eculizumab based on the incidence and severity of adverse events, including infections (meningococcal meningitis and other infections), injection-site reactions, infusion-related reactions, hypersensitivity, and adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation. Pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity, biomarker, and health status utility objectives will also be assessed.
