    "abstract_text": "Objective To investigate how autoimmune mechanism playing a role in generation of colony-forming-cells(CFC), bone mononuclear cells(BMNC) from MDS were removed of autologous activated CD4 + T cells in vitro and cultured to find out effect of T cells on MDS hemopietic progenitor. Methods BMNC from 25 patients with low-grade MDS and 5 normal donors were depleted of CD4 + CCR5 + T lymphocytes using magnetic sorting. Depleted and plused CD4 + CCR5 + T BMNC were seeded onto methycellulose and the correlation of colony-forming-cell (CFC) number and the polarization of T cells were analyzed, the generation of CFC, the immunophenotype and the clonal cells(which had cytogenetic markers detected by FISH), was compared respectively. Results \u00a2A\u030a The capacity of BMNC from 5 healthy donors to generate CFC remained unchanged in the CD4 + CCR5 + T lymphocyte-depleted and lymphocyte-plused BMNC. In contrast, cultures initiated with CD4 + CCR5 + T lymphocyte-depleted BMNC from patients with low-grade MDS exhibited significantly increased generation of CFC compared with the corresponding lymphocyte-plused cultures, but the lymphocyte-plused cultures had no generation of CFC. \u00a2\u00c6 The number of CFU-E from the CD4 + CCR5 + T lymphocyte-depleted BMNC from patients with low-grade MDS showed significantly correlation with the percentage of Th1 (r=0.52, p\u2264\u00bc 0.05), but had no correlation with the percentage of Tc1 and the rate of Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2 (p >0.05); The number of CFC, CFU-G and CFU-GE had no correlation with the polarization of T lymphocyte (P >0.05). \u00a2C\u0327 The percentage of CD34 in bone nucleated cells of low-grade MDS was higher than that in healthy donors(1.8% vs . 1.0%, P >0.05), that of CD33 in nucleated cells of low-grade MDS was significantly higher than that in healthy donors[(20.3\u00b15.8)% vs .(13.8\u00b11.8)%(P\u2264\u00bc0.05)], and that of CD13 in nucleated cells of low-grade MDS was significantly higher than that in healthy donors[(21.1\u00b16.4)% vs . (11.6\u00b11.8)%(p0.05), that of CD33 decreased to (12.1\u00b13.7)%(p<0.05), and that of CD13 decreased to (17.1\u00b15.4)%(p<0.05), but the percentage of CD34, CD33 and CD13 had no significantly changed in healthy donors between pre-culture and post-culture. \u00a2E\u0300 FISH analysis in 6 patients revealed that +8 clone was increased(from 51% to 61%), but 20q- and -7 clone cell had no significantly changed. Conclusion In certain subtypes of MDS, selectedly removement of autologous activated CD4T cells can increase the generation of colony-forming-cells(CFC) in vitro, and improve the differentiation of MDS medullary system, but the increased CFC consisting of residual normal hemopoiesis or conal hemopoiesis were still unconcluded."
