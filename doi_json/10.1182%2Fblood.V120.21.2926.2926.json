    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2926 Introduction Angiogenesis plays a central role in the progression of both solid and hematological tumors. In particular, in multiple myeloma (MM) the critical role of bone marrow (BM) microenvironment and angiogenesis has been well documented. The past decade has witnessed a dramatic improvement in the therapeutic options in MM. However, the disease remains incurable, underscoring the need for continued efforts towards understanding MM biology and exploitation of novel therapeutic approaches. In this setting, monoclonal antibodies against myeloma-specific cell surface antigens represent a promising therapeutic approach, which is however hampered by a lack of appropriate target structures expressed across all pathogenic myeloma cells. The Eph receptors, a large family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) activated by ephrins binding, have been implicated in many processes involved in malignancy, including alteration of the tumor microenvironment and in angiogenesis, in both of which EpHA3 likely plays an active role. Aberrant expression of EpHA3 is seen in many types of hematolologic malignancies (some leukemic cell lines, T-cell lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myeloproliferative neoplasms) although it is not expressed ubiquitously. Finally, the over-expression of Eph is believed to be sufficient to confer tumorigenic potential although probably further mechanisms can occur to abnormally activate the receptor. Basing on the role of EpHA3 in haematological malignancies, a first-in-class engineered IgG1 antibody targeting the EpHA (KB004) was developed and it is now under phase I clinical trials in USA and Australia for the treatment of EpHA3 overexpressing hematological myeloid malignancies refractory to conventional treatment. We investigated the EpHA3 role and its preferential membrane\u2013bound by GPI linker ligand EFNA5, in MM patients in order to define EpHA3 as new molecular target for a novel therapeutic approach with a specific anti EpHA3 monoclonal antibody. The EpHA3 expression has been studied through a comparative proteomic analysis between BM endothelial cells (ECs) of patients with MM (MMECs) or with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGECs), of control subjects (normal ECs) and in MM cell lines. Methods After written informed consent, BM aspirates have been collected from 20 MM and 4 MGUS patients. Normal ECs were derived from 3 BM aspirates of subjects with anemia due to iron or vitamin B12 deficiency. We analyzed the expression levels of EpHA3 in normal ECs, MGECs and MMECs and MM cell lines evaluating the mRNA and protein levels by RT-qPCR and by WB coupled to ImmunoFluorescence analysis. The biological effects of EpHA3 targeting in MMECs have been studied silencing the EpHA3 mRNA in MMECs and testing them at 72h after silencing in series of functinal assays including viability assay by trypan blue exclusion staining and by in vitro angiogenesis assay followed by measurement of mesh areas and vessel length. Moreover, we studied EFNA5 mRNA expression levels in Normal ECs, MGECs and MMECs and in MM cell lines by PCR. Results Our data showed that EpHA3 mRNA levels are progressively increased from ECs to MGECs reaching the highest values in MMECs. Subsequent analysis by WB and immunofluorescence confirmed EpHA3 protein upregulation among the different EC types. The MMECs in which EpHA3 has been silenced revealed a protein level reduction of approximately 60% when compared to the control. We could not detect major viability defects. Furthermore, in vitro angiogenesis inhibition was marginal when compared to the not silenced counterpart. To know whether EpHA3 may impact not only MM angiogenesis but also plasma cells, three MM cell lines were studied for the EpHA3 expression. We found the plasma cell lines gave constant over expression of EpHA3. Finally, the preliminary data regarding EFNA5 mRNA expression level showed it is expressed in either MMECs and MM plasma cell lines. The evaluation of KB004 effect on MMECs in term of apoptosis induction and in vitro tube formation inhibition, as well as the analysis of EpHA3 levels in primary MM plasma cells are in progress. Conclusions From this study we expect to characterize the role of the EpHA3in MM patients and to provide experimental evidences supporting the possibility of using EpHA3 as a new molecular target for MM by proving the in vitro efficacy of a monoclonal antibody to target the angiogenesis of MM.
