    "abstract_text": "GVHD is the major cause of morbidity and mortality following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We developed a consistent and sensitive model of human GVHD by retroorbitally (ro) injecting huT cells into sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID-\u03b22m null mice (\u03b22). Using this model, 59% (20/34) mice conditioned with 250cGy and injected ro with 10 7 huT cells developed lethal XGVHD and exhibited huT cell engraftment, weight loss, and infiltration in multiple target tissues. \u03b22 mice injected with huT through the lateral tail vein (iv) had only small and transient huT cell engraftment and failed to develop lethal XGVHD. To evaluate why the ro versus iv route affected huT cell engraftment and the development of lethal XGVHD, we performed in vivo BLI and sequential [ 18 F]FHBG microPET imaging studies. We used huT cells transduced with a click beetle red luciferase/enhanced green fluorescent protein (CBRluc/egfp) BLI reporter gene (huT*) and/or a chimeric CD34-thymidine kinase fusion suicide/PET gene. We injected 10 7 huT* cells either iv or ro into 250cGy irradiated \u03b22 mice. Mice injected iv (n=5) failed to develop lethal XGVHD, whereas 60% of the mice injected ro (n=5) developed lethal XGVHD. During the first week, mice injected ro presented early expansion of the huT cells in the retroorbital cavity and local regional draining lymph nodes followed by widespread dissemination throughout the whole body, with increased percentage of huT in the blood (p10-fold increase in the BLI signal during the first 2 weeks. This homing pattern and strong BLI signal of the ro-injected huT* cells remained until death from GVHD. The BLI signal of the iv-injected huT* cells increased between days 21 and 45. However, this late expansion was not associated with the development of XGVHD. We also generated huT cells that co-expressed the suicide gene CD34-TK75 and CBRluc/egfp (huT**). We observed the same results after we injected 0.25\u00d710 7 huT** cells into 250cGy irradiated and anti-CD122 mAb-treated NOD/SCID mice followed with BLI and PET. These studies demonstrated the ability to image trafficking of the transduced T cells in vivo with BLI and PET. In summary, all mice that received huT iv showed initial clearing of the huT cells in the lungs and a significant delay in their in vivo expansion abrogating their potential to cause XGVHD. In contrast, the development of lethal XGVHD in immunodeficient mice was dependent upon the initial retention and early expansion of huT in the retroorbital cavity.",
