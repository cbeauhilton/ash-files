    "abstract_text": "Background: The analysis of overall survival (OS) of patients with a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who were receiving treatment with tyrosinekinase inhibitors (TKI) - imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib in routine practice is a promising direction. Aims: To assess the efficacy of the 1- nd (imatinib) and 2-nd (nilotinib, dasatinib) lines therapy of TKI - OS in non-selected patients with a CML in routine practice. Methods: The study included non-selected group of 88 patients with CML in different phase: 44 patients with CML in early chronic phase (ECP), 44 patients with CML in late chronic phase (LCP) who have received early in the disease the imatinib in the 1-nd line therapy in routine practice. We have estimated OS during 12 years of treatment with TKI, defined by standard statistical methods. Results: 31 (70.5%) of 44 patients in ECP were alive by 12 years of therapy of TKI. 23 (74.2%) of 31 patients receiving imatinib, 8 (25.8%) - nilotinib in the 2-nd line therapy. 13 (29.5%) of 44 patients died, 6 of them (13.6%) - due to disease progression. Thus, the 12-year OS was 70.5%. 26 (59%) of 44 patients in LCP were alive by 12 years of therapy of TKI. 18 (41%) of 44 patients died, 15 of them (34.1%) - due to disease progression. 13 (50%) of 26 patients receiving imatinib in the 1-nd line therapy, 13 (50%) - TKI in the 2-nd line therapy: 5 (38.5%) patients receiving nilotinib, and 8 (61.5%) patients receiving dasatinib. Thus, the 12-year OS was 59%. Summary/Conclusion: Our study showed the high efficacy of TKI in the 1- nd and 2-nd lines therapy in non-selected patients with CML in routine practice.
