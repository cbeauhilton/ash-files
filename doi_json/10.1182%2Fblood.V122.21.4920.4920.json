    "abstract_text": "The present study was designed to evaluate the biocompatibility of DNR-PEG-PLL-PLGA as nanoparticles which provide the evidence before clinical application. We applied some tests to assess the safety of DNR-PEG-PLL-PLGA nanoparticles. There was low cytotoxicity of the PEG-PLL-PLGA nanoparticles in vitro when detected by the MTT assay. Cell apoptosis and intracellular accumulation of PEG-PLL-PLGA were determined by FCM assay. The apoptosis induced by nanoparticles and the fluorescence intensity of intracellular DNR demonstrated that DNR-PEG-PLL-PLGA could be taken up by L929 cells, in which DNR was persistently released. Hemolysis test and micronucleus (MN) assay were carried out to estimate the nanoparticles that they were no blood toxicity and no genotoxicity. DNR-PEG-PLL-PLGA nanoparticles were injected into mice through tail vein to calculate the median lethal dose ( LD 50), the results showed that they had a wide safe scale. The pathologic changes of heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney were observed in nanoparticles treated mice. The influence of DNR-PEG-PLL-PLGA to mice hepatic and renal functions were measured by extracting the blood by retro orbital injection, they were no significant difference compared with the control group. These results clearly illustrated that DNR-PEG-PLL-PLGA appear to be highly biocompatible and safe nanoparticles that are suitable for further application in the treatment of tumor.
