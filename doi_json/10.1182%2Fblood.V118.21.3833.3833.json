    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3833 Background: Survival in primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is assessed by the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) ( Blood 2010;115:1703 ) and DIPSS-plus ( JCO 2011;29:392 ). The latter is based on eight risk factors including age>65 years, constitutional symptoms, hemoglobin 25 \u00d7 10 9 /L, platelet count <100 \u00d7 10 9 /L, peripheral blood (PB) blasts \u22651% and unfavorable karyotype. Recent studies have highlighted the prognostic significance of monosomal karyotype (MK) ( Blood 2011;117:5612 ), unfavorable karyotype ( Leukemia 2011;25:82 ) and platelet count <100 \u00d7 10 9 /L (( JCO 2011;29:392 ), for leukemic transformation (LT) in PMF. Methods: A combination of multivariable and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were applied to a Mayo Clinic database of 884 karyotypically-annotated patients with PMF, in order to define karyotype-dependent and karyotype-independent risk models for LT. The karyotype-independent model was further validated in a separate cohort of 525 PMF patients from an international database ( Blood 2010;115:1703 ). Patients in the Mayo cohort were evaluated at time of referral and those of the international database at time of initial diagnosis. Results I: Sixty cases of LT were documented. Karyotype (categorized into MK, inv(3)/i(17q) abnormalities, other unfavorable, and favorable), PB blast percentage (as a continuous variable), and platelet count (as a continuous variable) were the most reliable (p<0.01) in predicting leukemia-free survival (LFS). The best discriminant levels for inferior LFS were MK (HR 6.2, 95% CI 2.2\u201317.1), inv(3)/i(17q) abnormalities (HR 7.6, 95% CI 1.8\u201333.3), PB blast \u22652% (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.4\u20134.2) and platelet count \u226441 \u00d7 10 9 /L (HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3\u20135.1). MK and inv(3)/i(17q) abnormalities were subsequently consolidated into one \u201cvery high risk\u201d cytogenetic category ( n =27), with a corresponding HR of 6.6 (95% CI 2.7\u201316.0). HR-based risk scores were assigned to \u201cvery high risk\u201d karyotype (2 points), PB blast \u22652% (one point) and platelet count \u226450 \u00d7 10 9 /L (one point) to classify patients into low (no adverse points; n =522), intermediate (one adverse point; n =290) and high risk (two or more adverse points; n =72) groups; the corresponding 3-year LT rates were 3%, 10% (HR 2.6; 95% CI 1.4\u20134.6) and 35% (HR 9.4, 95% CI 4.7\u201318.7) ( Figure 1 ).

The karyotype-independent model was validated in a separate cohort of 525 PMF patients with 70 documented cases of LT, from an international database ( Blood 2010;115:1703 ). Conclusions: The current leukemia risk models are applicable at diagnosis or during follow-up, in the presence or absence of cytogenetic information, and complement DIPSS-plus in the comprehensive prognostication of patients with PMF.
