    "abstract_text": "Sequential conditioning regimens, comprising cytoreductive chemotherapy shortly applied prior to reduced intensity conditioning are successfully used for high-risk (HR) AML/MDS in matched related and unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, few data are available for sequential conditioning in the context of HLA-haploidentical transplantation (haplo-HSCT), especially in the elderly. To investigate the relative merits of sequential haplo-HSCT in the elderly we retrospectively analyzed the outcome of thirty-five patients (pts) with advanced AML/MDS (>=50 years old). Thirty-three pts suffering from HR AML, defined by refractory, relapsed or secondary leukemia, or complete remission with adverse-risk genetics according to ELN criteria and two pts with HR MDS according to IPSS-R, who underwent T-cell-replete haplo-HSCT at our institution between January 2009 and November 2016 were included. Disease was active in 29 pts while 6 had achieved CR. Pre-transplantation risk factors were scored using the hematopoietic cell transplantation-specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI) which was \u22653 in 13 pts (median HCT-CI:2, range 0-8). A sequential therapeutic concept using either FLAMSA (n=26) or clofarabine (n=9) for cytoreduction was used prior to RIC in all pts. Bone marrow (54%) and peripheral blood stem cells (46%) were both used as graft source. Post-grafting immunosuppression consisted of high-dose cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus and MMF in all pts. Median age was 60 years (50-70). One graft rejection occurred. Three pts died early in aplasia. Neutrophil and platelet engraftment was achieved in 95% and 77% of evaluable pts, respectively at a median of 16,5 (13-89) and 31,5 (11-103) days.Acute GvHD grade I-III occurred in 25/32 of the pts (grade III n=2); no patient developed grade IV aGvHD. Chronic GvHD was observed in 13/29 pts and was most frequently assessed as mild (n=6) or moderate (n=5) while 2 pts developed severe cGvHD. No GvHD related death was observed. CI of NRM at day 100, 1-year and 3-years was 11%, 23% and 23%, respectively. CI of relapse at 1- and 3-years was 15% and 27%, with a median time to relapse of 152 days (20-413). At a median follow up of 27 months (4-74), estimated one- and three-year overall survival (OS) was 62% and 52% respectively. One- and three-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 59% and 52%. Our results suggest that using a sequential therapeutic concept in PTCY-based haplo-HSCT is safe and properly tolerated while it provides a favorable disease control when treating elderly HR MDS/AML pts. Thus, sequential haplo-HSCT seems to be a valuable alternative in pts who lack a conventional donor or are in urgent need for prompt transplantation.
