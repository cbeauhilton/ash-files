    "abstract_text": "Background: WHIM (Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections, and Myelokathexis) syndrome is a rare, autosomal-dominant primary immunodeficiency. Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in the CXCR4 gene are the most common cause of WHIM syndrome, manifesting as panleukopenia with severe neutropenia, lymphopenia, and monocytopenia, recurrent bacterial infections, unusual susceptibility to human papillomavirus infections with intractable mucocutaneous warts, and increased risk of malignancy (McDermott DH, et al. Immunol Rev. 2019;2878:91-102). Mavorixafor is an investigational, small-molecule, selective antagonist of the CXCR4 receptor being developed as an oral, once-daily (QD) treatment for patients with WHIM syndrome (Dale DC, et al. Blood. 2020;136(26):2994-3003). Objective: We present an update on the clinical outcomes of patients with WHIM syndrome who continued in the long-term extension of the phase 2 study, highlighting long-term safety and efficacy. Methods: A long-term extension is ongoing as part of the open-label, prospective, dose-escalation, phase 2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of mavorixafor (NCT03005327) in adults with WHIM syndrome. Individuals with a pathogenic GOF CXCR4 mutation and absolute neutrophil count \u2264400/\u03bcL and/or absolute lymphocyte count \u2264650/\u03bcL were included. All provided written informed consent. The primary objectives were to evaluate safety and tolerability and assess safe dosage. Exploratory efficacy end points included changes in infection rates, number of cutaneous warts, and white blood cell counts, compared to baseline. Researchers completed detailed interviews of 4 participants continuing in the study to assess their overall study experience and perceived treatment effects. Results: Five of 8 patients in the dose-finding phase 2 study entered into the long-term extension (LTE); median treatment duration was 148.4 weeks. One patient left the LTE because of study fatigue, and all 5 patients had dose escalation to 400 mg oral QD as of May 2021. As of the November 2020 data cutoff, annualized infection rates decreased from 5.6/year at study baseline to 2.2/year at 40 months' treatment, providing evidence of persistent reduction of infections over time. At doses of 300 and 400mg QD (n=7), the mean time above threshold for ANC and ALC were 12.7 hours (SD \u00b1 9.8) and 16.9 hours (SD \u00b1 5.9) compared to 2.1 hours (SD \u00b1 3.3) and 11.5 hours (SD \u00b1 5.9) at doses \u2264200 mg QD, respectively. One patient experienced a 79% reduction in warts. Safety data review at May 2021 showed that there were 12 minor treatment-emergent adverse events (grade 1) with long-term treatment (46 months), no treatment-related infections of grade 3 or higher, no treatment-related serious adverse events, and no clinically significant laboratory abnormalities with mavorixafor treatment. Patient interviews revealed that all 4 LTE participants experienced good tolerability of mavorixafor and decreased frequency, severity, and duration of infections and decreased hospital/doctor visits. Three of 4 participants reported previous need for prophylactic treatment to prevent infection of minor wounds, but with mavorixafor, minor wounds healed without infection or need for prophylaxis. The mechanism of action of mavorixafor was of interest to 3 of 4 participants, who found it important that treatment address the underlying cause of disease, not simply the symptoms. Two participants reported a QOL improvement, and the other 2 reported that WHIM syndrome never affected their QOL Conclusion: Ongoing long-term treatment of adults with WHIM syndrome with mavorixafor 300 to 400mg shows durable increase in neutrophils and lymphocytes and sustained improvements in infections and warts. Detailed patient interviews for patient global impression of changes are consistent with sustained clinical benefit of long-term treatment. Mavorixafor has the potential to be a safe, effective, and long-term therapy targeting the underlying cause of WHIM syndrome. A global phase 3 registrational study is ongoing.
