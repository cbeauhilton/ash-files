    "abstract_text": "Background: The SIPPET study investigated inhibitor development in 251 previously untreated patients (PUPs) treated with either plasma-derived FVIII products containing von Willebrand factor (pdFVIII/VWF; n = 125), or recombinant FVIII (rFVIII; n = 126) from hamster cell lines. Amongst PUPs with non-null F8 mutations, none developed inhibitors when treated with pdFVIII/VWF while the cumulative inhibitor incidence was 43% in those treated with hamster-cell-derived rFVIII. In patients with null F8 mutations, the cumulative inhibitor incidences were 31% and 47% in patients treated with pdFVIII/VWF and rFVIII, respectively. In patients with null mutations the cumulative incidences of high-titre inhibitors were 22% and 30% with pdFVIII/VWF and rFVIII, respectively. Aim: To investigate the relationship between inhibitor development and F8 mutation type in PUPs with severe hemophilia A treated with either a rFVIII from a human cell line (Nuwiq \u00ae ; simoctocog alfa) or either of two pdFVIII/VWF products, one with a VWF/FVIII ratio of 0.4 (octanate \u00ae ) the other with a VWF/FVIII ratio of 1.0 (wilate \u00ae ). Materials and Methods: Data from completed multicenter, prospective trials with octanate \u00ae and wilate \u00ae and interim data from the NuProtect study with Nuwiq \u00ae were analyzed. Data on F8 mutation type were available for 50/51, 27/28 and 58/66 patients in each of the studies. All patients in the three studies had no previous treatment with FVIII concentrates or other blood products containing FVIII. Results: In the three studies, 18% (9/50), 7.4% (2/27) and 19%.0% (11/58) of patients had non-null mutations. None of the patients with non-null mutations developed inhibitors with octanate \u00ae , wilate \u00ae or Nuwiq \u00ae . In patients with null mutations, 9.8% (4/41), 12.0% (3/25), and 17.0% (8/47) developed high-titre inhibitors. Conclusions: PUPs with non-null F8 mutations did not develop inhibitors when treated with octanate \u00ae , wilate \u00ae or Nuwiq \u00ae . Whilst the different studies are not directly comparable, the findings with these products, two pdFVIII/VWF and a rFVIII from a human cell line, show similar behavior to the SIPPET trial where no patients with non-null mutations treated with pdFVIII/VWF products developed inhibitors.
