    "abstract_text": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura(TTP) is a serious, low morbidity and high mortality disease, which can simultaneously affect multiple systems in the patients\u2019 body. In the event that the patients cannot be treated by plasma exchange(PE), mortality will be 95\u2013100% (1) . Between September, 2000 and May, 2003, thirteen patients with TTP were treated mainly by heparin, vincristine, dexamethasone, six of whom have acceptted one or two PE. The results were excellent. Twelve of the thirteen patients survived. One patient was dead. The ADAMTS13 activity was measured in 10 patients using a Residual-Collagen Binding Assay(R-CBA)."
