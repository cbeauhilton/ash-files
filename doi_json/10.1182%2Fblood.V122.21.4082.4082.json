    "abstract_text": "Introduction Evolution to myelofibrosis (MF) represents a relatively rare but always severe event in patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV). Few reports have focused on the clinical and biological features at diagnosis of ET and PV that correlate with progression to MF. Aims and Methods We retrospectively studied a series of patients with post-ET and post-PV MF and compared with a group of ET and PV patients with a long follow-up without myelofibrotic evolution, with the aim to identify prognostic factors for MF. Forty-three patients with post-ET (n=29) and post-PV (n=14) MF followed at our institution were compared with 125 ET and 75 PV patients with at least 9 years of follow-up without evolution. Diagnosis of ET and PV was confirmed according to WHO criteria (including JAK2 analysis, performed since 2006 and study), evolution to MF was defined according to IWG-MRT proposed criteria. The following parameters, available for all patients at diagnosis of ET or ET, were taken into consideration to find prognostic risk factors for myelofibrosis: age, platelet (PLT) count, hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels, white blood cell (WBC) count. Statistical analyses were conducted using Student t test. Results Median time from diagnosis of ET/PV and progression to MF was 156 months (range: 29-314). Comparing baseline characteristics of patients who evolved to MF and those who did not, we did not found any significant correlation. Mean data at diagnosis for patients with (n = 43) or without (n=200) subsequent evolution to MF were as follow: age 52.1 vs 53.1 years (p=0.79), Hb 15.4 vs 15.7 g/dl (p=0.59), Hct 47.2 vs 47.1% (p=0.67), WBC 9.8 vs 9.1 x 109/l (p=0.11), PLT 713 vs 689 x 109/l (p=0.87). Also when considering only the 29 post-ET MF and the 125 ET patients, there was no clinical feature present at diagnosis that could foresee a future myelofibrotic evolution. Conversely, in the 14 post-PV MF and 75 PV patients, progression to MF was predicted only by higher WBC count (11.4 vs 9.3 x 109/l, p=0.046), while no correlation was found with age, Hb, Hct or PLT [ Table 1 ].

Other clinical characteristics present at diagnosis, such as advanced age, anemia or polycythemia and thrombocytosis do not seem to be associated with higher risk of fibrotic evolution in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.
