    "abstract_text": "Background: Atypical HUS is a rare disorder caused by uncontrolled activation of the alternative pathway of complement. It presents with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), renal insufficiency and in 20% of cases extrarenal manifestations. Most cases of aHUS result from a genetic defect. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all adult patients with TMA assessed by our apheresis service between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2013. Complement genetics studies included screening CFI, CFH, CFB, MCP/CD46, CFHR5, C3 and THBD/CD141 genes and were performed at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. Complement protein and function studies (CH50, AH50, C3d, sC5b-9, C3, factor H, factor I, and anti-CFH antibody) were performed at the University of Heidelberg, Germany. Results: During the study period, 65 patients with TMA were assessed. On clinical and laboratory grounds, 16 patients (25%) were diagnosed with aHUS. 15 patients underwent complement genetics studies and 10/15 (73%) had no disease causing mutations identified. Data on 5 patients with genetic abnormalities are summarized in Table 1. All patients were women, mean age 33 years. 4 patients (80%) had extra-renal manifestations. Mean PLT count nadir during acute episode was 40xE9/L. In most TMA episodes, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) resulted in a partial response (normalization/stabilization of thrombocytopenia and/or LD and/or creatinine) (Table 1). Due to limited access to eculizumab, the drug was not consistently used. 3 patients (2, 3 and 5) had low C3 and normal C4, a pattern classically described in aHUS. 4 patients underwent additional complement protein studies during acute episode (Table 2).

Extrarenal manifestations were common and, in most cases, TPE resulted in only a partial response. Only 3 patients had a classically described pattern of low C3 and normal C4. The utility of extensive complement protein studies requires further study. Disclosures Pavenski: Alexion Pharmaceuticals: Honoraria.
