    "abstract_text": "Solitary plasmacytoma (SP) is a rare plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by the presence of bone or extramedullary tumors consisting of monoclonal plasma cells, without evidence of systematic multiple myeloma (MM). The treatment of choice is local radiotherapy (RT) with or without surgical excision (SE). Our aim was to describe the clinical features, the outcome and prognosis of SP patients. Thus, we studied 97 consecutive patients, 65 with solitary bone plasmacytoma (SBP) and 32 with solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma (SEP), (M/F: 66/31, median age: 61 years, range 17-85 years) who were diagnosed and treated in 12 Greek Myeloma Centers; treatment was given according to each center\u2019s local policy. Patients with SBP and SEP did not differ in age, gender, performance status (PS), Hb, CRP, LDH, calcium, beta2-microglobulin, renal function or impairment of humoral immunity (immunoparesis). Patients with SEP presented more often with serum or urinary monoclonal component (p24 vs. \u226424 months had a 10-year OS of 82% vs. 60% (p=0.01). Achievement of CR predicted positively for PRFS. Immunoparesis (n=24) predicted negatively for progression to MM. Chemotherapy including NA had no prognostic impact on OS, PRFS or MMFS. Our study demonstrated that patients with SP enjoy a prolonged OS that is favorably influenced by young age and PRFS. We also confirmed that patients with SBP progress more frequently to MM compared to SEP in the era of novel agents. Radiotherapy with or without SE remains the treatment of choice for SP. The additional use of systematic therapy including novel anti-myeloma agents increases toxicity without improving survival or decreasing the probability of SP relapse or progression to MM. Immunoparesis predicts for progression to MM. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
