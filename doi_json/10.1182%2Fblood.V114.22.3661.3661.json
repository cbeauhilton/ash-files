Previous data suggested routine use of this procedure may be unnecessary. The Ann Arbor classification is currently used to detect pts requiring BMB, despite sensitivity (sen) of 100%, specificity (spec) is only 40%. We sought to determine whether a modified IPS [Hasenclever and Diehl (1998)] would yield greater spec while maintaining good sen. Methods We retrospectively reviewed charts of 1215 histologically proven HL pts from Jan 2000-Dec 2008 at Cleveland Clinic Taussig and Moll Cancer Centers. Of 1215 pts, 1089 had BMB (90%). 876 pts were included in our study. 213 were excluded due tor un-interpretable BMB or missing data. Each component of IPS was equally weighted such that one point is assigned to each positive variable [male sex, age \u226545, albumin (alb) <4 g/dL, hemoglobin (hem) <10.5 g/dL, stage IV, white blood cell (WBC) \u226515,000/mm 3 , lymphocyte (lymph) <600/mm 3 and/or <8% of total WBC], Multivariable logistic regression was initially used to assess the association between bone marrow involvement (BMI) and each factor in the IPS. All 7 factors were significant (p<.001 for sex, age, albu, hem, stage and lymph; .07 for WBC); and therefore recursive partioning algorithm was used to identify a cutoff for determining BMI. Result 88 pts (10%) had BMI, we used a modified IPS formally by calculating a score that uses \u201cweights\u201d based on the results of a multivariable model including all 7 factors and the relative magnitude of the associated regression coefficients (RC), [modified IPS= WBC+2x(sex+age+hem)+3x(stage+alb)+4xlymph]. This model suggests lymphopenia has a stronger impact on the presence of BMI, while leukocytosis has the least impact. The percentage of BMI was 0.1,17,48, and 87 % for pts with a score of 0-8, 9-10, 11-12, and >12 respectively. Using a score of >8 as a rule for BMI, sensitivity was 99% and specificity was 87%. The prevalence of BMI by histology was 4% lymphocyte-rich, 5% nodular sclerosis, 20% mixed-cellularity and 21% lymphocyte-depleted, further analysis showed using modified IPS, sensitivity and specificity were similar across all types of histologies. Conclusions Using a modified IPS of > 8 for predicting BMI in HL doubled the spec associated with Ann Arbor classification. The implementation of modified IPS is a practical and reliable tool that will allow physicians to predict BMI in HL pts. Therefore eliminate unnecessary painful procedure in many pts.  factor . RC .
