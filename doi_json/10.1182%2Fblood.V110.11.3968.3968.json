    "abstract_text": "Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is an effective treatment for both hepatitis C associated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hemophilia A. Factor VIII activity usually increases into the normal range. Only a few patients with hemophilia complicated by an inhibitor have undergone OLT with both successful outcomes and uncontrolled bleeding being reported. We report early results of OLT in a middle-aged white male severe hemophilia A patient with a history of a high responding inhibitor (historical high - 70 Bethesda units) who had been on immune tolerance for greater than 10 years prior to transplant. A regimen of 40 u/kg of Factor VIII three times per week successfully suppressed inhibitor titers to less than 2 Bethesda units in the previous years. Hand surgery was managed with Factor VII infusions in the year prior to OLT with good results. At the time of transplantation, his inhibitor titer was 0.7 B.U. Due to his history of non-linear kinetics with factor VIII infusion, (5% of a dose remaining at 24 hours), frequent bolus dosing during surgery was employed. He received 10,500 units (116 units/kg) prior to the incision with smaller doses repeated every 2\u20134 hours. During the operation and the 24 hr immediately post op he required another 27,300 units (300 units/kg) of factor VIII infusion to maintain activity between 61\u2013122%. On post op day 1 he required 46 units/kg to keep activity between 60.2\u2013108%. On post op day 2 he required 35 units/kg to keep activity between 36.8\u201368.4%. His immunosuppresion included tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and solumedrol taper of 120 mg on day 2, 80 mg on day 3, 40 mg on day 4, and 20 mg day 5. From day 6 to day 8, his total bilirubin increased to 15 and his requirement for Factor VIII also increased to 70 units/kg daily for 3 days to keep his activity between 33.1% to 71.2%. His immunosuppression was increased because of possible acute rejection and solumedrol 500 mg IV was given daily for 3 days. On day 9 his requirement for factor decreased to 11.6 units/kg daily for 4 additional days. Solumedrol was tapered off to prednisone 10 mg po daily. On day 13 post operation, Factor VIII replacement was stopped and his activity was 56.8%, which gradually rose to 81% on day 25. We conclude: Orthotopic liver transplantation was successful in a hemophilia A inhibitor patient on long term immune tolerance. Factor VIII production by the transplanted liver suppressed the inhibitor and normalized Factor VIII activity up to 4 weeks post transplant. Close follow-up will be required.",
