    "abstract_text": "CD38 expression can be detected on a majority of NK/T cell lymphoma (NKTCL). Based on the clinical data of 94 patients with ENKTL, high CD38 surface expression was an adverse prognostic factor for progression free survival, and these patients had significantly inferior outcomes (Wang, 2015). This corroborates with our own studies showing that relapsed and refractory NKTCL patients almost always exhibit high CD38 expression, thereby proposing that it may be worthwhile to target CD38 as a novel therapeutic option. Daratumumab is a human anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody which has shown significant anti-cancer activity in multiple myeloma. In this study, we investigated the potential cytotoxic effects and mechanisms of actions of Daratumumab in a panel of 10 NKTCL cell lines. Firstly, we identified that cell lines can be stratified into CD38 Hi , CD38 Mid and CD38 Lo as quantified by mRNA expression and CD38 protein surface expression which was qualitatively analysed by FACS and IHC. Daratumumab is able to induce antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in a CD38-dependent manner and in a dose-dependent fashion. We also observe a greater induction of antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) activation in correlation with CD38 expression. Furthermore, complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) was significantly triggered by Daratumumab in CD38 Hi and CD38 Mid cells. However, we found evidence of an additional level of regulation provided by the expression of complement inhibitory proteins(CIPs) CD46, CD55 and CD59 on NKTCL cell lines which can limit and inhibit the induction of CDC regardless of CD38 surface expression levels. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is a vitamin A derivative that binds to retinoic acid receptor alpha leading to the upregulation of CD38 expression. Treatment with ATRA increases CD38 mRNA and surface protein expression in all CD38 Hi-Lo NKTCL cell lines. Interestingly CD38 Lo cell lines showed the greatest fold increase of CD38 mRNA and surface protein expression. Notably, addition of ATRA to SNK-10, a CD38 Lo CD55 Hi cell line, prior to Daratumumab treatment was able to improve the induction of ADCC but not CDC. This suggests a critical role for CIPS in mediating the induction of CDC in NKTCL. Subsequent investigation for the efficacy of Daratumumab in vivo is currently being performed. We also discovered a synergistic cytotoxic effect in NKTCL CD38 Hi cell lines mediated by L-Asparaginase (a component of the current chemotherapeutic regimen in NKTCL) treatment in combination with Daratumumab. Altogether,these results propose a rationale therapeutic option for single or combined Daratumumab treatment in the clinic especially for relapsed and refractory patients.
