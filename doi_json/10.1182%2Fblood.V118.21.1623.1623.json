    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1623 Background: Peripheral T-cell non-hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) comprise a heterogeneous group of malignancies, characterized by an aggressive disease course and a poor clinical outcome. T-cell lymphomas present in lymph nodes and they also frequently involve extra nodal sites. The first line treatment consists in CHOP-like regimen. Consolidation treatment in first line or in relapse is autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Patients and methods: We retrospectively analysed the data of 189 adults who had received chemotherapy in our institution between 2000 and 2010. Results: Median age at time of presentation was 55 (range 17\u201389) years, 76% were <65 years. 50% had B symptoms and 50% serum elevated LDH. ECOG was 0\u20131 in 60% and 2\u20134 in 40%. According to the Ann Arbor classification, 15% were stage I-II and 85% were stage III-IV. 50% had low IPI (0-1-2) and 50% had elevated IPI (3-4-5). The histologic subtypes were 42% peripheral T-cell NHL unspecified (PTCL-U), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), 8% had ALK+ and 10% had ALK-, 24% angioimmunoblastic lymphoma (AILT), 3% transformed mycosis fungoide, 2% instestinal T-cell lymphoma, 2% hepatosplenic \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell lymphoma and 1% adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia. Primary extranodal lymphoma represented 17% and 8% were diagnosed with hemophagocytosis. Five-year overall survival (OS) was 28.3% (21.8\u201336.8%), and five-year progression free survival (PFS) was 18.4% (13.1\u201325.7%). On multivariate analysis, ALCL-ALK+ (p=0.008), AILT (p1 (pN (p=0.003) were independent adverse factors for OS. Moreover B symptoms (p<0.01) was a significant factor for PFS. 86% received CHOP-like induction treatment. The median number of chemotherapy was 2 (1\u20137). 59% experienced a complete response during the therapeutic procedure, while 22% were primary refractory. 44% had ASCT and 14% allogenic SCT. Only 28% of patients referred for allogenic SCT received this treatment. Conclusions: This 10-year review of patients treated in a single institution with initial conventional chemotherapy followed by more intensive treatments confirms the poor OS and PFS in the case of T-cell lymphoma. Despite a low incidence, T-cell lymphoma could be a priority area of research for new treatments with a potential to improve OS and PFS. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
