    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4827 Background: The introduction of HAART has significantly improved the outcome of pts with HD-HIV. However there are no data on the long term follow-up of HD-HIV pts treated with conventional chemotherapy (CT) regimens. In 2002, we reported the results of a prospective phase II study with the intensive 12-week CT with adjuvant radiotherapy (Stanford V) and concomitant HAART in 59 pts (Spina et al. Blood 2002;100:1984-1988). Methods: To analyze the long term outcome of patients included in the Stanford V and HAART protocol. Results: The median follow-up is 67months (range 3\u2013156 months The 5-yr overall survival (OS), freedom from progression (FFP), disease free survival and event free survival are 54%, 52%, 60% and 37%, respectively. The 5-year OS is significantly different in pts with an international prognostic score (IPS) >2 in comparison to that of pts with an IPS <3 (84% vs 36%, p= 0.0005). Similarly, the percentages of FFP at 5 years in these groups are 72% and 45% (p= 0.03). Conclusions: Our data confirm the long term efficacy of Stanford V regimen in combination with HAART in HD-HIV. However, Stanford V is significantly less effective in pts with IPS>2 and therefore new strategies be tested in this setting. Supported by AIRC and ISS grants.
