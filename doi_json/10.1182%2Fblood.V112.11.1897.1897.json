    "abstract_text": "Human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a cell surface adhesion molecule member of the Immunoglobulin Superfamily (IgSF). Aberrant upregulation and secretion of soluble CEA is a common feature found in a wide variety of human cancers such as colon, breast and lung. Previous in vitro and in vivo results have demonstrated that CEA can affect tumor cell behavior including the inhibition of cell differentiation and apoptosis. However, any functional effects on angiogenic endothelial cell behavior are so far unknown. In the present work we found that in endothelial cells exogenous CEA led to a time and dose dependent increase in ERK phosphorylation, which was inhibited by the specific MEK inhibitor U0126. Thereby, the observed CEA effect was comparable in time and intense with the canonical angiogenic growth factor VEGF. The CEA-induced ERK phosphorylation was not affected by the blockage of VEGFR-2 / flk-1 using a specific inhibiting peptide (CBO-P11), which indicates a VEGF-independent mechanism. Furthermore, co-stimulation of endothelial cells with VEGF and CEA shows synergistic effects on ERK phosphorylation. While in endothelial cells no endogenous expression of CEA is detected, its putative receptor, the CEA receptor (CEAR), is highly expressed as shown by immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded colon carcinoma sections as well as in biochemical analyses. When an activating antibody against CEAR was used, CEA-induced ERK phosphorylation was mimicked, while downregulation of CEAR by siRNA diminished CEA-induced signal transduction, significantly. To test a biological relevance of our findings, we first measured endothelial cell proliferation: CEA led to a dose dependent increase in endothelial cell proliferation in vitro, which again revealed a synergistic effect with VEGF. Thereby, CEA-induced endothelial cell proliferation was again independent of VEGFR-2 / flk-1. A biological role of CEA in tumor-angiogenesis was reflected by an in vivo model using CEA Mimotope immunized BALB/c mice, which were transplanted with MethA/CEA overexpressing tumor cells. Immunohistological analyses of these tumors revealed a significantly reduced vascular density, which was accompanied with diminished tumor growth. Our data provide first evidence of CEA as a novel pro-angiogenic activator of endothelial cells, which results in an increase in endothelial cell proliferation, independent of VEGFR-2. Furthermore, by targeting CEA in an in vivo mouse model, tumor-angiogenesis was markley reduced, indicating a potential therapeutic target in cancer.",
