    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5053 Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic malignancy in the United States. There are over 20, 000 newly diagnosed MM cases every year and despite the recent advances in care of MM patients, more than 10, 000 MM patients still die from their disease. After experiencing only modest improvements in the care of patients for over 30 years, treatment of MM has dramatically improved over the last decade due to the advent of multiple novel agents. Significant variations in practice patterns among medical oncologists have been observed. In addition to problems with quality of care, health care costs for MM patients can vary dramatically because physicians often treat patients with the same condition differently in choice of drugs. Many times significant variety is present even among oncologists who work in the same practice. Cancer Care Northwest (CCNW) is the largest cancer group in the Inland Northwest with over 20 board certified cancer physicians. In addition to having a well-established myeloma program, CCNW also offers autologous stem cell transplantation to the patients in the community setting (approximately 25 transplants/year). CCNW implemented \u201cMultiple Myeloma Clinical Care Pathways\u201d in 2008. These pathways have been regularly updated according to the newest data presented at the national meetings, recent publications, and new FDA approvals. Over the last 4 years more than 100 unique MM patients have been treated on clinical care pathways. At the meeting, we will present our data including patient characteristics and outcomes. We will also show how our center's multiple myeloma clinical care pathways have evolved over the years. Treating multiple myeloma according to clinical care pathways standardizes treatment and decreases variation. Disclosures: Kaya: Millennium, Celgene, Onyx, Novartis: Honoraria, Speakers Bureau."
