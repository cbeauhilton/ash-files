    "abstract_text": "In resting platelets, the cytoplasmic domains of glycoprotein (Gp) Ib\u03b1 and \u03b23 integrin link the GpIb-IX-V and \u03b1IIb\u03b23 complex with adapter proteins, cytoskeletal elements and lipid and tyrosine kinases. Biochemical and pharmacological analyses of intact platelets and genetic analyses of recombinant GpIb-IX-V and \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in CHO cells point towards the hypothesis that a series of cytoskeletal proteins form a functional tether connecting the cytoplasmic domains of GpIb\u03b1 and \u03b23 integrin. To test the hypothesis that dynamic contractility of this tether modulates VWF-induced signaling between GpIb-IX-V and \u03b1IIb\u03b23, we examined how pathological shear stress affects connections between tethering elements and how altering the contractile function of the tether affects VWF-induced platelet adherence and aggregation. We observed in resting platelets that there is no co-immunoprecipitation of GpIb\u03b1 and \u03b1IIb\u03b23. The large dimeric actin-binding protein filamin A co-immunoprecipitates with both GpIb\u03b1 and \u03b23 integrin, but its association with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is inhibited by DNaseI, indicating that it binds indirectly to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 through cytoskeletal connections. These connections were investigated in resting platelets by examining a series of immunoprecipitates (IP) for co-precipitating proteins using immunoblotting (IB). We observed the following IP/IB pairs [(+) designates that the co-precipitation is DNaseI-sensitive]: \u03b23/talin (+); talin/\u03b1-actinin (+); talin/vinculin (+); and talin/filamin A (\u2212). We also observed that myosin heavy chain (MHC) and the tyrosine kinase Syk co-immunoprecipitate with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in resting platelets. When washed platelets in buffer containing calcium (1 mM) and VWF (5 \u03bcg/ml) were sheared at 120 dynes/cm 2 for 2 minutes, the cytoskeletal linkage separates: there was enhanced filamin A, actin and \u03b1-actinin binding to GpIb\u03b1, enhanced vinculin binding to \u03b1-actinin, enhanced talin binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23, and both myosin and the tyrosine kinase Syk disassociated from the \u03b23 tail. Inhibiting myosin contractility with the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) inhibitor ML-9 (1 mM) inhibited the shear-induced association between talin and \u03b23, as well as platelet aggregation in response to 120 dynes/cm 2 in the cone plate viscometer and platelet-dependent thrombosis from whole blood onto type I collagen in a parallel plate flow chamber with a shear rate of 500 sec \u22121 (shear stress of ~ 20 dynes/cm 2 ). The data presented support a model of shear-induced platelet aggregation in which a series of cytoskeletal proteins serve as a mechanotransducing scaffolding linking the cytoplasmic domains of GpIb\u03b1 and \u03b23 integrin. When GpIb-IX-V engages ligand under shearing forces, the force is transduced from GpIb\u03b1 to filamin to actin/\u03b1-actinin to vinculin to talin to \u03b23, and contractility driven by the activation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23-associated myosin enhances talin binding to \u03b23, thereby effecting a conformation change that creates a ligand-receptive \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Such interactions may be regulated by cytosolic ionized calcium (which effects MLCK activation) and tyrosine kinases (\u03b1IIb\u03b23-associated Syk disassociates from \u03b23 following shear). These results provide evidence that the structural scaffolding connecting GpIb-IX-V with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 localizes signaling elements to functionally important compartments that modulate \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation and shear-induced platelet aggregation.",
