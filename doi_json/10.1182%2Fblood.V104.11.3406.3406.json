    "abstract_text": "Motexafin gadolinium (MGd, Xcytrin\u00ae) is a tumor-selective redox mediator that catalytically oxidizes intracellular reducing metabolites and produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this report, we demonstrate that MGd induces apoptosis or growth inhibition in several hematopoietic tumor-derived cell lines and tumor cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Lymphoma (HF-1, Ramos, DHL-4, DB, Hut78 and Raji) and leukemia (Jurkat, HL-60) cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 media with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum with or without 50 u M MGd. MGd inhibited the growth of 6 of the cell lines (HF-1, Ramos, HL-60, DHL-4, Jurkat and DB) and was cytotoxic to HF-1. ROS were implicated in MGd-induced cell death since their presence was detected by dichlorofluorescein diacetate staining and peroxiredoxin oxidation in MGd treated HF-1 cells that undergo apoptosis, but not in Jurkat cells that do not undergo MGd-induced apoptosis. MGd triggered an apoptotic pathway in HF-1 cells as demonstrated by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, activation of caspases, cleavage of PARP and annexin-V binding. MGd also induced cell death and activated caspases in vitro in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. Protein lysates from cultured cell lines (HF-1, Ramos) were subjected to immunoblot analysis to determine caspase cleavage patterns, and the phosphorylation status of Akt, a kinase that regulates survival pathways. In MGd treated HF-1, phospho-Akt protein levels initially increased 2\u20133 fold between 30 min and 1 hr (n=4) and then decreased to 40\u201350% of control levels by 24\u201348 hrs (n=4). The drop in phospho-Akt protein coincided with an increase in apoptotic cell death as indicated by morphology, staining with Annexin-V and activation of caspases. Addition of a specific inhibitor of Akt phosphorylation (SH-5) reduced Akt phosphorylation in MGd treated HF-1 cells by 90% and enhanced the cytotoxic effect of MGd. In Ramos cells, which do not undergo apoptosis when treated with MGd, co-treatment with MGd and SH-5 decreased phospho Akt levels by only 15% and did not result in cytotoxicity. These data point to a potential role for Akt in MGd-induced apoptosis and suggest that MGd activity may be enhanced by inhibition of Akt. These data show that the pro-apoptotic effects of MGd involve caspase activation and provide a rationale to evaluate MGd in the treatment of lymphoma and leukemia patients.",
