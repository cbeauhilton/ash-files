    "abstract_text": "There is an ongoing controversy as to whether cancer is always maintained by a rare population of highly specialized cancer stem cells or whether cancer-propagating cells may be more abundant in some cancer types. We have previously shown that in a heterogeneous group of childhood ALL different blast populations, regardless of their expression of the progenitor/stem cell marker CD34 or the lymphoid differentiation antigen CD19, contain leukemia-initiating activity (Cancer Cell 2008, 14(1), 47\u201358). By profiling B cell transcription factor expression, these different populations appeared to mirror stages of normal B cell development. Here we extend our experiments to another lymphoid differentiation marker, CD20, to provide further evidence that ALL blasts at different stages of maturation possess the ability to re-initiate the leukemia.

Bone marrow was harvested from leukemic mice and flow sorted candidate populations (CD19 + CD20 \u2212/Low and CD19 + CD20 High ) were re-transplanted into 52 secondary and 8 tertiary mice. As expected from our previous experiments both CD19 + CD20 \u2212/Low and CD19 + CD20 High cells were able to re-establish the disease in unconditioned NOD/scid y \u2212/\u2212 mice (see table). Leukemic engraftment ranged from 0.5 to 73% as determined by flow cytometry on bone marrow aspirates. Both populations re-established the complete phenotype of the original leukemia including CD20 \u2212/Low and CD20 High blasts. These results were confirmed by directly sorting primary ALL blasts from L754 without prior passage in the mice. Cell purity after flow sorting was high (81\u201399%) and low numbers of cells engrafted (5000 for both CD19 + CD20 \u2212/Low and CD19 + CD20 High ). The three patients reflected different ALL subtypes (L736 intermediate risk ALL: high WBC/MRD low risk, L754:high hyperdiploid/MRD high risk; and A67: high risk ALL/t(9;22)). In conclusion, these results confirm our previous observation that ALL blasts irrespective of the expression of lymphoid differentiation markers are able to engraft immune-deficient mice. Therefore, leukemia-propagating cells in childhood ALL may be more abundant than previously thought."
