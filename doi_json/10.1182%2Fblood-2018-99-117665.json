    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder caused by \"antiphospholipid\" antibodies (aPL) directed against \u03b22-glycoprotein I (\u03b22GPI). In the presence of \u03b22GPI, aPL activate endothelial cells through TLR4-mediated and other pathways. Previous studies suggest that a region encompassing amino acids 39-43 of \u03b22GPI domain 1 comprises an important binding site for pathogenic aPL. However, due to difficulty in expressing full-length recombinant \u03b22GPI, antibody specificity has only been tested using individual, recombinant \u03b22GPI domains. Further definition of antibody specificity using intact recombinant \u03b22GPI provides a new approach for diagnostic and mechanistic studies. In the present study we describe the expression of full-length, wild-type recombinant \u03b22GPI and site-directed mutants encompassing the putative \u03b22GPI binding region in domain 1. Binding of APS patient-derived anti-\u03b22GPI antibodies to these proteins and their ability to support anti-\u03b22GPI-mediated endothelial cell activation was determined. Methods: Full length APOH cDNA with a modified signal peptide (spm) was cloned into the lentiviral vector pLenti CMV Puro DEST. We generated two mutants spanning the 39 to 43 amino acid region: SEGVG (R39S; G40E; M42V; R43G) and AAGMA (R39A; G40A; R43A). The final recombinant plasmids were termed as pDEST-spmAPOH-WT; pDEST-spmAPOH-SEGVG and pDEST-spmAPOH-AAGMA. Lentivirus was produced using the Lentiviral Gateway Expression kit using GP2-293 (HEK) cells. Stable cell lines were generated by transducing HEK cells with APOH-lentivirus and selecting against puromycin. Stable cell lines were transferred to serum-free media and grown in suspension. Cell culture supernatants containing secreted \u03b22GPI were filtered and concentrated, and recombinant \u03b22GPI was purified using a hitrap-heparin column. Anti-\u03b22GPI antibody binding to plasma-derived and r\u03b22GPI was determined using a standard \u03b22GPI ELISA and SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance) on a Biacore 3000. Biosensor analysis was performed by crosslinking \u03b22GPI to carboxymethyl-dextran coated sensor chips using amine coupling. Anti-\u03b22GPI antibodies at concentrations ranging from 1-15,000 nM, were flowed through channels until equilibrium binding was achieved, at which point dissociation was assessed over a 10 minute interval. The BIAevaluation program was used to calculate association and dissociation rates. Endothelial cell activation was assessed by measuring cell surface E-selectin expression after incubating cells with control IgG or anti-\u03b22GPI antibodies in the presence or absence of wild-type or mutant r\u03b22GPI. Molecular modeling was performed using PyMol. Results: After transduction with lentivirus encoding \u03b22GPI with a modified signal peptide, HEK-293 cells were able to express and efficiently secrete r\u03b22GPI and site-directed mutants. Using a standard \u03b22GPI-ELISA and SPR we found no significant differences in binding affinity of aPL towards plasma-derived and wild-type r\u03b22GPI. However, in the anti-\u03b22GPI ELISA, binding of patient-derived aPL (APS21) to both mutants was reduced by ~70% compared to wild-type r\u03b22GPI. Consistent with binding specificity for a region encompassing aa 39-43, the Kd for binding of APS21 anti-\u03b22GPI antibodies to wild-type and r\u03b22GPI-SEGVG determined by SPR was 20 nM and 5000 nM, respectively. Moreover, the ability of patient-derived APS21 anti-\u03b22GPI antibodies to activate endothelial cells was reduced by >60% in the presence of r\u03b22GPI-SEGVG compared to wild-type r\u03b22GPI. Molecular modeling of \u03b22GPI demonstrated that a mutation in the aa 39-43 region is predicted to cause a change from a net positive to a net negative charge without any structural change (Figure 1). Conclusion: These studies are the first to assess binding of human anti-\u03b22GPI antibodies to r\u03b22GPI and site-directed mutants expressed in mammalian cells. No significant differences between binding of aPL to plasma derived and wild-type r\u03b22GPI were observed. APS21 aPL has specificity towards epitope 39-43 of \u03b22GPI domain 1 and its binding affinity to r\u03b22GPI-SEGVG was significantly reduced. Functional studies demonstrate the importance of \u03b22GPI aa 39 to 43 in supporting endothelial cell activation by anti-\u03b22GPI antibodies. These recombinant proteins should facilitate further studies concerning the role of aPL-\u03b22GPI interactions in the diagnosis and pathogenesis of APS.
