    "abstract_text": "Background: Loss-of-function mutations in the transcription factor IKZF1 (IKAROS) correlate with poor prognosis in B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), and are particularly prevalent in the high-risk BCR-ABL1+ and BCR-ABL1-like disease subtypes. While recent studies using mouse models of Ikaros-deficient B-ALL have uncovered Ikaros-regulated genes, the mechanisms by which IKAROS loss promotes leukemogenesis and confers treatment resistance remain unclear. Results: We have generated a novel transgenic mouse model that allows tet-regulated, shRNA-mediated Ikaros knockdown or restoration in normal lymphocytes and leukemias in vivo . Ikaros knockdown significantly decreases disease latency in mouse models of B-ALL driven by transgenic or retroviral expression of the BCR-ABL1 fusion oncogene, recapitulating a common genetic interaction in high-risk pediatric B-ALL. Remarkably, we find that restoring endogenous Ikaros expression in established BCR-ABL1+ ALL causes rapid disease regression and sustained remission despite ongoing expression of BCR-ABL1, indicating that disabled Ikaros remains a critical disease driver in this context. Using integrated in vivo RNA-seq analysis we have identified a novel set of genes that are (1) differentially expressed in Ikaros-low versus Ikaros-wildtype leukemias and (2) concordantly differentially expressed upon acute Ikaros restoration in established Ikaros-low leukemias. We are now performing in vitro and in vivo loss-of-function genetic screens to interrogate these high confidence Ikaros-regulated genes, focusing on potential roles for Ikaros-activated genes in tumor suppression and Ikaros-repressed genes in promoting BCR-ABL1+ ALL self-renewal. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that B-ALL driven by expression of BCR-ABL1 and Ikaros loss remains dependent on ongoing Ikaros suppression, suggesting that re-engaging or inhibiting critical components of the Ikaros-regulated gene expression program may provide new therapeutic avenues in this high-risk B-ALL subtype.
