    "abstract_text": "Introduction . Screening for inherited thrombophilia has been recommended in patients with cryptogenic ischemic strokes and anticoagulant therapy is frequently indicated based on these results. However, current evidence suggests that thrombophilia screening is over utilized in stroke patients and may provide more risks than benefits. Patients and Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke who had a thrombophilia screen and determined the proportions of each thrombophilia trait, and the proportion of high risk thrombophilia in this population. Pre-specified subgroup analyses were conducted for patients with ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attacks, and for patients with patent foramen ovale. Results. We included 412 patients (152 male and 260 female). The prevalence of thrombophilia was 7.52% (95% CI 5.35-10.48). The proportion of major thrombophilia was 2.18 (95% CI=1.15 - 4.09). The proportion of thrombophilia traits in ischemic stroke patients was lower 4.92% (95% CI 2.61 - 9.08) than that in patients with transient ischemic attacks 9.57% (95% CI = 6.41 - 14.06); Only 2 individuals had both a positive thrombophilia screen and a patent foramen ovale. Discussion . In this study the prevalence of thrombophilia traits in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack was low, including high risk thrombophilic traits. Further studies are needed to determine if thrombophilia screening exposes these patients to additional risks without any benefits.
