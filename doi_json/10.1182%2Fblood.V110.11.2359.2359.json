    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy for Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma (NHL) is initially effective, but often limited by toxicity and resistance. New agents for the treatment of NHL are needed. HB22.7 is a monoclonal antibody that binds CD22 and has previously been shown to reduce human lymphoma xenograft volume in nude mice. OBJECTIVES: (1) Develop a 64 Cu-DOTA-HB22.7 antibody, for in vivo imaging and potential therapy of NHL. (2) Determine if tumor targeting of 64 Cu-DOTA-HB22.7 is equivalent between intravenous (IV), intraperitoneal (IP), and subcutaneous (SQ) routes of administration. METHODS: DOTA-HB22.7\u2019s ability to bind CD22+ cells was assessed by flow cytometry. 64 Cu-DOTA-HB22.7 was injected IV, IP, or SQ into xenograft-bearing nude mice and tumor targeting assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) and biodistribution assay. Pharmacokinetics were determined by measuring radioactivity of blood samples. Serum was analyzed by radio-TLC. RESULTS: DOTA conjugation does not affect HB22.7\u2019s ability to bind CD22. 64 Cu-DOTA-HB22.7 demonstrates specific tumor targeting at 24 and 48 hrs. Targeting is equivalent regardless of route of administration. Pharmacokinetics demonstrate that 64 Cu-DOTA-HB22.7 can access the bloodstream (and thus, target tumor) in IP or SQ injections. By 48 hrs, blood 64 Cu levels are (a) equivalent, regardless of injection route and (b) below peak levels, indicating clearance from the circulation. Serum analysis shows that right-shifted TLC peaks, possibly 64 Cu-DOTA-HB22.7 metabolites, are present only in the IV injected group at 48 hrs. CONCLUSION: These findings establish 64 Cu-DOTA-HB22.7 as an NHL-specific imaging agent and indicate its potential for use in radioimmunotherapy. These findings provide evidence that more accessible routes of administration can achieve equivalent targeting results, and may lead to more efficient and accurate administration of antibody-based therapeutics in mice."
