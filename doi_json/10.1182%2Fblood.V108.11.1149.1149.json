    "abstract_text": "NE-180 is a glycoPEGylated recombinant human erythropoietin that binds to and activates the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor. It has demonstrated in vitro activities comparable to EPO and an extended serum half-life in animal studies. This may allow less frequent dosing in patients being treated with chronic anemia. METHODS: A single center, open-label study of NE-180, administered as single escalating doses given by the SC or IV route, was conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD. Subjects (male or female NHV) were planned to be assigned to one of 4 dose groups, 10 subjects per dose with 5 SC and 5 IV subjects per group: 0.5, 1.5, 3, or 4.5 mg/kg. Each dose group was planned to be initiated in an ascending, sequential fashion unless or until stopping rules were met. RESULTS: 25 NHV (16 females) were enrolled in the first two dose cohorts and have completed 56 day follow-up. The 1.5 mg/kg IV cohort met the protocol-specified Hb rate of rise stopping rule (change in Hb greater than 1 g/dL during any 14 day period). Injections were generally well tolerated with no discontinuations for adverse events or serious adverse events. Reticulocyte increases were dose proportional. Average reticulocyte count at baseline was 1.0\u00b10.3%. The maximal increase occurred at day 7. The mean change from baseline for the 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg SC group was: 0.9\u00b10.4% and 2.2\u00b10.9%, respectively. The mean change from baseline for the 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg IV group was: 1.7\u00b10.8% and 2.3\u00b10.8%, respectively. PK data will be presented. CONCLUSIONS: Single doses up to 1.5 mg/kg of NE-180 administered to NHV were generally well tolerated and demonstrated potent dose-dependent erythropoietic activity."
