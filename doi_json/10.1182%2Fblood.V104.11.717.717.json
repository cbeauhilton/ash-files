    "abstract_text": "Bcr-Abl, the translocation product of the Philadelphia chromosome implicated in human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), is a kinase affecting hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) behavior with respect to proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion and migration. Rho GTPases, particularly the Rac subfamily, have been shown to regulate these same cell functions in normal HSC and also regulate gene expression in many mammalian cells. BCR contains a \u201cGTPase-activating protein\u201d domain and a guanine nucleotide exchange domain, the latter or which is preserved in p210 Bcr-Abl. Since HSC functions regulated by Bcr-Abl and Rac are similar, we studied the potential involvement of Rac activation in Bcr-Abl signaling cascade. Human CML samples demonstrate baseline activation of Rac proteins that is reversed by in vitro treatment with STI571. To study the specific involvement of Rac2, we used a gene targeted mouse model with Rac2 null bone marrow. Using retovirus-mediated gene transfer, we introduced p210 Bcr-Abl in the MSCV vector into wild-type or Rac2\u2212/\u2212 HSC/P and studied the behavior of these cells in vitro and in vivo. Irradiated recipient mice injected with LDBM cells transduced with p210 developed a uniformly fatal myeloproliferative syndrome (Median survival: 45 days, N=12), while mice injected with p210 transduced Rac2\u2212/\u2212 LDBM cells (N=12, 2 independent exp.) had 100% survival and no development of leukocytosis, splenomegaly or organ infiltration of hematopoietic cells. These data suggest that Rac GTPases are critical for the transformation of HSC by Bcr-Abl and provide an additional therapeutic target for intervention in CML.  . WILD TYPE . Rac 2 \u2212/\u2212 . .
