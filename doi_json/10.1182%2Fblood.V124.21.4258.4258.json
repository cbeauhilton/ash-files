    "abstract_text": "Background: Pediatric Anti-Phospholipid Syndrome (APS) is the most commonly acquired state of hypercoagulability in children, and is defined by venous and/or arterial thrombosis in the presence of circulating anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPLs) (most commonly lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) and anti-\u03b22-glycoprotein antibody (a\u03b22GP)). Catastrophic APS (CAPS) is a rare manifestation of APS, with thrombosis of multiple vessels that can lead to multi-system organ failure. Purpose: To determine the thromboses outcomes and factors predisposing to the risk of thrombotic recurrence in pediatric patients with a diagnosis of APS. Methods : Retrospective review of patients between the ages of 0-21 years diagnosed and treated with APS from 1997-2013 at our institution. Clinical data and long-term outcomes of these patients were reviewed. Exclusion criteria included neonatal APS and thrombosis with fetal loss. Statistical tests were performed using JMP software (\u00a9 2014 SAS Institute Inc., North Carolina, US). Associations between categorical variables were tested using chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test when required. Differences were considered statistically significant if p<0.05. Results: The study identified 23 patients (12 female; 11 male). Three patients with CAPS were identified and excluded from the analysis (3 female). Gender distribution for primary and secondary APS was similar (5 female/6 male primary APS; 4 female/5 male secondary APS). The median follow up period was 3.2 years (range; 0.01 \u2013 16.87 years ). Median age at diagnosis of first episode of thrombosis was 16.16 years (range; 6.05 \u2013 20.6 years) . Nine patients (45%) with secondary APS had underlying autoimmune disease or malignancy (7 systemic lupus erythematosus, 1 ulcerative colitis, 1 Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma) and the remaining 11 patients were diagnosed as primary APS. Arterial and venous thrombosis occurred as the first thrombotic event in 7 (35%) and 13 (65%) patients, respectively. Lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was the most frequent thrombotic event 11/20 (55%), followed by pulmonary embolism 7/20 (35%), ischemic stroke 4/20 (20%), lower extremity arterial thrombosis 3/20 (15%), upper extremity DVT 2/20 (10%), and IVC thrombosis 2/20 (10%). Recurrent or progressive thrombotic events occurred in 12/20 patients (60%). Of those, 7 were venous (58%), 5 were arterial (42%). At the time of recurrence, 3 patients were fully anticoagulated, (INR 2.5-3.5) versus 9 who were subtherapeutic (INR<2.0). Recurrent/progression thrombotic events occurred at the original site of thrombosis in 8 patients (3 arterial, 5 venous) while the remaining 4 recurrent thrombotic events occurred at other sites than the primary site. Overall venous and arterial thrombotic events were no different among primary or secondary APS (p=0.88). Thrombosis recurrence/progression risk at the original site or distant site was no different among primary or secondary APS (p=0.22 and p=0.30 respectively). Risk of recurrence/progression was not associated with subtherapeutic levels of anticoagulation (p=0.08), or presence of residual thrombosis at primary site at the time of recurrence (p=0.48). Conclusion: Recurrence and/or progression of thrombosis in APS occurred in 60% of the patients in our cohort, with 25% of the thrombosis recurrences occurring despite documented therapeutic anticoagulation in these patients. In contrast to other studies, our APS cohort demonstrated a higher rate of recurrence with other groups reporting thrombosis rates of recurrence such as 19-25%. Our cohort demonstrated similar rates of primary and secondary APS among female patients, in contrast to other studies suggesting higher rates of secondary APS in females. Potential risk factors such as primary versus secondary APS, subtherapeutic anticoagulation, and residual thrombosis from primary thrombotic event were not found as significant risk factors for thrombosis recurrence. Larger pediatric APS studies are needed in order to address other potential risk factors for thrombosis (ie obesity, inherited thrombophilia, intensity of anticoagulation, immune suppression approach for secondary APS), in order to establish treatment strategies for the prevention of recurrent thrombosis.
