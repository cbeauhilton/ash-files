This has made FLT3 an important target for drug development in AML. Several FLT3 inhibitors are currently being developed (eg, sorafenib, PKC-412, AC-220, CEP-701, IMC EB10, sunitinib). Results from early trials with many of these agents suggest they have clinical activity in the treatment of MDS and AML, although most responses are represented by a marked decrease in blast counts, with few complete remissions(CR). Whether these responses ultimately improve long-term outcome of pts, and whether they may be particularly beneficial for pts with FLT3 mutations compared to those with FLT3 wild-type (WT) is being investigated. Aims: To ascertain outcomes of patients given treatment with FLT3 inhibitors, alone or in combination with other therapies, and to compare outcomes in those patients with FLT3 mutations (ITD or D835) versus those with FLT3-WT. Methods: We reviewed the records of patients with MDS and AML who were enrolled on clinical trials with FLT3 inhibitors at our institution. We compared patient outcomes in those who received a FLT3 inhibitor in both FLT3 positive and FLT3 negative patients. Pts were classified as receiving FLT3 inhibitors 1) as part of their initial therapy, 2) as first salvage, or 3) as second salvage or beyond. Results: A total of 128 pts were included: 51 (40%) with FLT3-WT, 56 (44%) with FLT3-ITD, 11 (9%) with D835, and 10 (8%) had both FLT3-ITD and D835. The overall median age was 62 yrs (range, 17-88); by FLT3 status, median age was 70 yrs (35-88) for FLT3-WT pts and 58 yrs (17-81) for FLT3 mutated. Sixty-four pts (50%) were female. Twenty-three (18%) pts received FLT3 inhibitors as part of their induction therapy (18 FLT3-WT, 5 FLT3 mutated; median age 74 yrs); 22 (17%) as first salvage (4 FLT3-WT, 18 mutated; median age 67 yrs); and 83 (65%) as second or later salvage (29 FLT3-WT, 54 mutated; median age 59 yrs). Nine pts overall, all of whom were FLT3 mutated, achieved either CR (n=6) or CRp (n=3) with FLT3 inhibitors. Eight of the nine CR/CRp have been lost with a median CR duration of 8 months (mo) (3-12+). After a median follow-up of 3.5 mo, 115 (90%) pts have died, including 47 (92%) FLT3-WT, and 68 (88%) FLT3 mutated. The median survival is 3.8 mo for the total population. Survival by mutation status and timing of FLT3 inhibitor therapy is presented in table 1.  Group . FLT3-WT . FLT3 mutated . p value * . No. . Median survival (mo) . . Median survival (mo .

Additional studies incorporating these agents in AML therapy are warranted. Disclosures: Off Label Use: Sorafenib has not been FDA approved for use in MDS and AML.
