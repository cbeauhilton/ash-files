    "abstract_text": "Objectives To explore the effect of donor CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells (T Reg ) on hematopoietic reconstitution, immune reconstitutuion and GVHD in patients who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Methods 30 patients were divided into high T Reg cell group (T Reg \u226510.0\u00d710 6 cells/kg) and low T Reg cell group (T Reg <10.0\u00d710 6 cells/kg) according to the number of T Reg cells in the grafts. 13 patients were in high T Reg cell group and 17 in low T Reg cell group. The patients details of the two groups are in the following table. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to continuously detect the percentage of T Reg cells in the graft, T lymphocyte subsets and T Reg cells in the recipients\u2019 peripheral blood at different time after allo-HSCT. The hematopoietic reconstitution, immune reconstitution, T Reg cell reconstitution, the incidence of GVHD and the disease-free survival were observed in the two groups. Results The reconstitution of WBC and plantelet of high T Reg cell group and low T Reg cell group were 8.62\u00b12.293 and 8.88\u00b12.713, 12.69\u00b15.736 and 15.18\u00b116.708 days, respectively, and differed little between the two groups (P value was 0.778, 0.613, respectively). The incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) in high T Reg cell group (15.38%) was obviously lower than that in low T Reg cell group (58.82%) ( P =0.016). There was significantly negative correlation ( r =\u22120.382, P =0.037) between the number of infused donor T Reg cells and severity of aGVHD. The reconstitution of CD4 + CD3 + T, CD45RO + CD4 + T cells at 15 days and CD3 + T, CD4 + CD3 + T cells at 30 days in high T Reg cell group were notably faster than those in low T Reg cell group after allo-HSCT (P value was 0.039, 0.024, 0.014, 0.020, respectively). The reconstitution of T Reg cells at 15 and 180 days were significantly faster than those in low T Reg cell group after allo-HSCT (P value was 0.013, 0.005, respectively). The 2-year disease-free survival of high T Reg cell group and low T Reg cell group were (69.90\u00b115.50)% and (85.60\u00b19.50)%, respectively, and there were no significantly difference between the two groups (P=0.514). Conclusion T Reg cells could contribute to decreasing the incidence of aGVHD, promoting immune reconstitution and T Reg cells reconstitution.",
