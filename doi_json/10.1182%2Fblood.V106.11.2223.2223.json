In adults, a significant number of skeletal diseases have been linked to abnormal osteoclast function(s), including rheumatoid arthritis, periodontal disease, multiple myeloma, and metastatic cancers. Although, a clear picture of the critical players that regulate osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption has begun to emerge; further studies detailing the intracellular signaling pathways is necessary for the rationale development of new drugs for the treatment of bone disorders involving OCs. While recent studies utilizing pharmacologic inhibitors of PI-3Kinase have suggested a role for this pathway in osteoclastogenesis, these inhibitors interfere with the function of all classes of PI-3Kinase and result in extensive in vivo toxicity. Therefore, to therapeutically manipulate PI-3Kinase signaling cascade in osteoclasts, additional data evaluating the specific role of individual PI-3Kinase isoforms is necessary. Class IA PI-3Kinase are heterodimeric kinases consisting of a regulatory subunit and a catalytic subunit. Five different proteins, namely p85\u03b1, p55\u03b1, p50\u03b1, p85\u03b2, and p55\u03b3, have been identified to date as the regulatory subunits. The p85\u03b1, p55\u03b1, and p50\u03b1 proteins are derived from the same gene locus by alternative splicing mechanism. In contrast, distinct genes encode the p85\u03b2 and p55\u03b3 subunits. Utilizing mice deficient in the expression of p85\u03b1 subunit, we have recently shown that p85\u03b1 subunit of PI-3Kinase plays an important role in regulating growth and actin based functions in bone marrow (BM) derived macrophages. Here, we demonstrate that OCs express multiple regulatory subunits of class IA PI-3Kinase, including p85\u03b1, p85\u03b2, p50\u03b1 and p55\u03b1. Deficiency of p85\u03b1 in OCs alone results in a significant increase in bone mass and bone density (% bone volume [BV]/trabecular volume [TV]: WT 6.7\u00b10.01 vs p85 \u03b1\u2212 / \u2212 14\u00b10.01*, *p<0.01). Histologic sections of p85 \u03b1 \u2212 / \u2212 bones reveal markedly increased cortical and trabecular mass. Despite their increased bone mass, mutant mice contain significantly greater numbers of OCs in vivo compared to wildtype controls (WT 45.6 vs p85 \u03b1 \u2212 / \u2212 118*, *p<0.01). Thus, although OCs appear in p85 \u03b1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice, nonetheless, the bones of these mice become osteosclerotic, suggesting that osteoclasts lacking p85\u03b1 may be defective. Consistent with this notion, p85 \u03b1 \u2212 / \u2212 BM derived OCs show reduced growth and differentiation in response to M-CSF and RANKL stimulation in vitro . Impaired differentiation due to p85\u03b1 deficiency is manifested in the form of a significant reduction in TRAP positive multinucleated OCs (WT: 23.6\u00b14 vs p85 \u03b1 \u2212 / \u2212: 11.7\u00b15*, n=3, *p<0.01), which is associated with a significant reduction in the activation of Akt and ERK MAP kinase. The transcription factor microphthalmia (MITF) is required for multinucleation of OCs. Mutations in MITF result in severe osteopetrosis. Recent studies have suggested that M-CSF induced ERK MAP kinase activation regulates MITFs function during multinucleation, therefore, we examined the expression of MITF in p85 \u03b1 \u2212 / \u2212 OCs. A 80% reduction in the expression of MITF was observed in p85 \u03b1 \u2212 / \u2212 OCs compared to controls. Remarkably, the defects in p85\u03b1 deficient OCs were observed in spite of the continuous expression of p85\u03b2, p50\u03b1 and p55\u03b1 subunits, suggesting that p85\u03b1 functions with specificity in regulating OC functions in vivo, in part by modulating the expression of MITF. Thus, p85\u03b1 is a potential new target for antiosteoporosis therapy.",
