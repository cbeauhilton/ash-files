    "abstract_text": "In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the variant t(15;17) translocation is responsive to differentiation therapy with retinoic acid (RA) while the t(11;17) APL is a more aggressive disease with poor prognosis. The latter produces two fusion proteins, PLZF-RARa and RARa-PLZF, and both proteins are required for leukemogenesis. To define the role of RARa-PLZF, we ectopically expressed the fusion gene in 32D cells and in primary bone marrow cells. First, our results show that RARa-PLZF inhibits myeloid gene expression, specifically CEBPa targets, which fulfill important function in cell survival and differentiation along the granulocytic lineage. Second, we found that repression by RARa-PLZF is dependent on the binding of C/EBPa to its cognate sequence in the promoter of CEBPa target gene, GCSFR. Third, we confirmed by chromatin immuprecipitation that RARa-PLZF associate with C/EBPa on DNA. Fourth, we showed that as PLZF, RARa-PLZF interact directly with HDAC1 and that this interaction causes a deacetylation of histone H3 at the promoter. This inhibition is reversed by treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitor (TSA) both in vitro and in vivo . Thus, this repression is dependent on direct interaction of RP with C/EBPa and recruitment of HDAC1, causing histone deacetylation at C/EBPa target loci. Finally, our data indicate that C/EBPa activity is severely impaired in leukemic cells from patients with t(11;17) APL, as compared to the t(15;17) APL, which is more amenable to therapy. In summary, our study indicates that the oncogene RARa-PLZF inhibits C/EBPa function through direct protein-protein interaction, and thus contributes to leukemogenesis in t(11;17) APL.",
