    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4486 Objective: In this study, we explored the efficiency and toxicity of 46 cases of double-unit CBT in adults with hematologic disease. Methods: The tolerance; transplant related complications; survival rate and disease free survival rate were observed and analyzed. A nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen included cyclophosphamide, fludarabine and 2Gy TBI. Cyclosporine combined mycophenolate mofetil and ATG were used to prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD). Results: All these 46 patients tolerated the therapy well while four patients had graft failure. Severe acute GVHD was presented in 6 patients. Chronic GVHD was occurred in 18 patients. Fatal infection complications were occurred in 7 patients (including CMV idiopathic pneumonia in 2 patients) and 5 patients relapsed after transplantation. Neutrophil engraftment obtained on day +17 and platelet reconstitution occurred on day +42 on median. In the follow-up duration of 29 months on median, the expected 3-year relapse mortality was 16.7%; non-relapse mortality was 26.1%; overall survival was 57.7%, and disease free survival was 48.2%. Conclusion: The use of double-unit CBT after reduced intensive conditioning therapy in adults with hematologic disease is an effective and safe treatment. Fatal infection and relapse are the main reasons of failure. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
