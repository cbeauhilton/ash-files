    "abstract_text": "Integrins are a large family of transmembrane \u03b1/\u03b2 heterodimers that subserve various cell-cell, cell-matrix, and cell-pathogen interactions. Integrins are present on cell surfaces in a dynamic equilibrium between inactive and active conformations that can be regulated by interactions involving their transmembrane (TM) domains. Thus, in their inactive conformation, the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunit TM domains interact, whereas the TM domains separate when integrins assume their active conformations. The role of TM domains in regulating integrin function has been extensively studied using the platelet integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and has revealed that the \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 subunit TM domains interact in both a heteromeric and homomeric fashion. These observations have led to a \u201cpush-pull\u201d hypothesis for regulating integrin function: events that disrupt the heteromeric association of integrin TM domains stabilize the active integrin conformation and push the equilibrium toward the activated state, whereas interactions that require separation, or are more favorable when the TMs are separated, pull the equilibrium toward the activated state. Although the factors that influence the homo- and hetero-association of the platelet \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 TM domains have been well studied, the \u201cpush-pull\u201d hypothesis for regulating integrin function has yet to be applied to other integrins, specifically to the leukocyte integrins \u03b1M\u03b22 (MAC-1) and \u03b1L\u03b22 (LFA-1). To determine the importance of TM interactions in \u03b1M\u03b22 and \u03b1L\u03b22, we used modified ToxR-based assays, ToxRed and Dominant-Negative (DN)-ToxRed, to measure the specificity and strength of the homomeric and heteromeric associations of the \u03b1M, \u03b1L, and \u03b22 TM domains in a bacterial membrane. ToxR is a single-pass TM transcriptional factor from V. cholera that activates the cholera toxin (ctx) promoter when it undergoes TM-driven dimerization in the inner membrane of E. coli. By co-expressing ToxR containing a \u03b22 integrin TM domain with either wild-type ToxR or a R96K ToxR mutant that can dimerize but is unable to activate the ctx promoter, we can measure both the homomeric and heteromeric interaction of each TM domain. In contrast to the TM domains of \u03b23-containing integrins that preferentially form homooligomers, the tendency of the \u03b1M, \u03b1L, and \u03b22 TM domains to form homo- and heterooligomers is nearly the same. To identify residues that are important for the homo- and heterooligomerization of these TM domains, each was scanned with leucine replacements. A small residue motif that lies along one face of the \u03b1M TM helix, similar to that identified in the \u03b1IIb TM domain, was found to mediate \u03b1M TM domain interactions. Based on these observations, we designed CHAMP (Computed Helical Anti-Membrane Peptide) peptides to specifically target the \u03b1M TM interface. In the CHAMP method, the backbone conformation for an \u03b1M-binding peptide is selected based on known structural preferences for the motifs identified in the \u03b1M helix. The sequence for the binding peptide is then designed computationally using a side-chain repacking algorithm. Ten anti-\u03b1M CHAMP peptides were designed and tested for their ability to bind to the \u03b1M TM domain in the DN-ToxRed assay. All ten designed sequences interacted with the \u03b1M TM domain to an equivalent or better extent than the natural \u03b1M and \u03b22 TM domain sequences. Thus, our studies indicate that like the TM domains of \u03b23-containing integrins, the TM domains of the \u03b22 integrins undergo both homomeric and heteromeric interactions, making use of canonical TM helix interaction motifs. Further, we have demonstrated the successful application of computational methods to design peptides that selectively target the \u03b1M TM domain, providing a novel method to address mechanistic questions about \u03b22 integrin structure and function."
