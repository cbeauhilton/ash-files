    "abstract_text": "Jak-Stat pathway is essential to transduce cytokine signalings. We previously reported that tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2), one of the Jak kinases, was essential but Stat1 was dispensable in IFN-alpha-induced B lymphocyte apoptosis. This indicates the existence of other signaling molecules besides Stat1 downstream of activated Tyk2. Therefore, in order to find Tyk2-activated signaling molecules which transduce IFN-alpha signal and induce B lymphocyte apoptosis, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with Tyk2, and identified Siva-1, which had been originally cloned as a CD27 binding protein. Siva-1 has a death domain (DD) homology region and induces apoptosis in various cells through binding CD27, which belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. We found that Tyk2 interacts with and phosphorylates Siva-1. Two regions of Siva-1, the N-terminus and the middle portion of the protein containing a death domain homology region, contributed to binding to Tyk2, and two tyrosines of Siva-1, Tyr 53 and Tyr 162 , were phosphorylated by Tyk2. Because Siva-1 is so far thought to be a proapoptotic protein, we assessed whether Tyk2 had any effects on Siva-1-mediated apoptosis through the Tyk2-Siva-1 interaction. First, we established BaF3 cell (IL-3 dependent murine proB cell) lines stably expressing either wild-type Tyk2 (BaF3/WT Tyk2) or constitutively activated Tyk2 which Valine 678 was replaced by Phenylalanine (BaF3/V678F Tyk2). In BaF3/V678F Tyk2 cells, Tyk2 and Stats are constitutively activated, and they grow in the absence of IL-3. We transiently transfected either GFP-Siva-1 or control GFP vector into BaF3/parent cells, BaF3/WT Tyk2 cells or BaF3/V678F Tyk2 cells. Thirty-six hours after transfection, we measured annexin V positive cells by flow cytometry on GFP-positive cells. Approximately 24% of both BaF3/parent cells and BaF3/WT Tyk2 cells transfected with GFP-Siva-1 fell into apoptosis, whereas only less than 7% of the cells transfected control vector showed apoptosis. The frequency of this Siva-1-induced apoptosis was increased in BaF3/V678F Tyk2 cells (over 43% vs <10% of expressing control vector), suggesting that activated Tyk2 augmented the apoptotic function of Siva-1. In conclusion, we show that Tyk2 associates with and phosphorylates Siva-1 and that this Tyk2-Siva-1 interaction enhances the apoptotic effect induced by Siva-1. This indicates that Siva-1 might be a probable key molecule downstream of Tyk2 which is activated in response to IFN-alpha.",
