    "abstract_text": "Background: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treatment in Mexican mestizos since the use of TKIs has been well described. Most of the studies only refers to the response rather than epidemiology. There are two large cohorts reported this years (Gad Med Mex 2016;152:208-212 and Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk 2016;16:57-62), but all national information is not available. Methods: Epidemiological data from samples referred to Laboratorios Fatima de Michoacan for identification of BCR-ABL translocation by chromosome or molecular analysis in patients with suspected chronic myeloid leukemia. Results: 77 positive samples for identification of BCR-ABL were analyzed. By physician indication 46 karyotype and 31 PCR. Male 40 and females 37, ratio 1.08/1. Age range from 15 to 87 years, mean 44.8. Three less than 19 years, thirteen from 20 to 29, twenty from 30 to 39 years, twelve from 40 to 49, twelve from 50 to 59, seven from 60 to 69, nine from 70 to 79 and one more than 80 years. Conclusions: Compared with data from other Mexican CML studies (cited above) the age at diagnosis was similar: 44.8, 45.8 and 47.0 years; important to mention that in the three studies there are patients less than 15 years old; in the ratio M/F there was a difference: 1.08, 1.37 and 1.32. Compared to CLL epidemiology data that we presented last year in the 57 th ASH Annual Meeting (Blood 2015;126:5269), CML presented more than 20 years earlier, 66.0 to 44.8 years; M/F ratio is elevated in CLL 1.6 a 1; and CML is more frequent, 77 to 52 cases in CLL.
