    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Despite the availability of iron chelation therapy, accumulation of excess iron in the heart results in cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure (CHF) and death in approximately 71% of transfused patients with \u03b2-thalassemia (\u03b2-thal) major. In preclinical and single-institution clinical studies, Exjade \u00ae (deferasirox, DFX) has demonstrated efficacy in decreasing cardiac iron. This ongoing study evaluates the effects of DFX on cardiac iron and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients (pts) with \u03b2-thal major in a prospective, single-arm, multi-center trial using cardiac MRI T2*. Here, we report preliminary results from patients who have completed 12 or 18 months of treatment. Methods: Twenty-eight pts were enrolled at four US centers. DFX was administered at 30\u201340 mg/kg/day for 18 months. Entry criteria included MRI evidence of cardiac iron (T2* <20 ms) and normal LVEF (\u226556%). Serum ferritin (SF) was assessed monthly and MRI assessments for liver iron concentration (LIC), cardiac T2* and LVEF were done every 6 months. Serum creatinine (SCr), biochemical and hematological status were also monitored. All results are reported as mean\u00b1SE (range) unless otherwise stated. Results: At the time of analysis, 18 pts had 12-month evaluations and 12 pts had 18-month evaluations. Five pts discontinued (one non-compliance, two patient decisions, and two deaths). Both deaths were considered unrelated to DFX treatment; the first patient enrolled with markedly elevated baseline cardiac iron (T2*=1.8 ms) and died secondary to CHF. The second patient death was due to sepsis and multi-organ failure. Baseline: All 18 evaluable pts (three male, 15 female; aged 10\u201344 years) received \u2265150 lifetime transfusions. SF was 4324\u00b1912 ng/mL (395\u201316,249). Cardiac T2* was 9.6\u00b10.97 ms (4.6\u201316.1), LIC was 18.7\u00b13.8 mg Fe/g dry weight (dw; 3.6\u201362.3) and LVEF was 61.7\u00b11.0%. 12-Month results: At 12 months, 7/18 pts were on 40 mg/kg/day. 12/18 pts (67%) had an increase in cardiac T2* with a mean difference of 2.2 ms (18%; P =0.025). 13/18 pts (72%) had a decrease in LIC with a mean difference of 2.4 mg Fe/g dw (25%; P =0.032). LVEF remained stable. SF fell by 583 ng/mL (n=18; 22%; P =0.147). 18-Month results: At 18 months, 3/12 pts were on 40 mg/kg/day. 10/12 pts (83%) had an increase in cardiac T2* with a mean difference of 4.1 ms (35%; P =0.001). 11/12 pts (92%) had a decrease in LIC with a mean reduction of 4.7 mg Fe/g dw (50%; P =0.003). Mean LVEF trended upward from 61.5 to 63.3% (n=13; P =0.2). SF fell by 1373 ng/mL (n=11; 46%, P =0.006). Safety data from pts (n=25) treated with 30\u201340 mg DFX were in line with previous studies. The most common drug-related adverse events (AEs; eight pts; 32%) were gastrointestinal in nature. 1/25 patients experienced a suspected SAE (hospitalization due to abdominal pain and vomiting) but completed the study. One patient developed SCr >upper limit of normal (ULN). Two pts (8%) had abnormal transaminases (\u22655\u00d7ULN) on \u22652 occasions but both had abnormal values at baseline. Conclusions: DFX monotherapy significantly improved cardiac and liver iron after 12 and 18 months. Overall, doses from 30\u201340 mg/kg/day were well tolerated. Cardiac T2* improvement rates were 1.5\u20131.9% per month, which is comparable to other monotherapy trials. A trend towards improved LVEF was seen in patients completing 18 months of therapy; however, a larger, long-term study will be required to confirm whether DFX can significantly improve cardiac function in this population.
