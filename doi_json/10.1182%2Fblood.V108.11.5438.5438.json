    "abstract_text": "43 patients with acute myeloid leukemia have undergone transplantation at our institution over the past 14 years. Patient selection criteria included age less than 70 years, creatinine less than 2mg/ml, no active infection, cardiac ejection fraction >40%, DLCO > 50% of predicted and no other co-morbid conditions that would jeopardize survival. 39 patients were in first remission, 4 were in second or higher remission. 3 patients had favorable cytogenetics, 40 had intermediate or unfavorable cytogenetics. After achieving remission for at least 30 days, patients were consolidated with Etoposide and AraC, followed by G-CSF. Hematopoietic stem cells were collected when the WBC rebounded to at least 10,000/\u03bcl. The target dose of CD34 positive cells was 5\u00d710 6 /kg. The minimum dose given was 2.3 \u00d7 10 6 /kg). High dose therapy consisted of Busulfan 1mg/kg and Etoposide 60mg/kg. The average age at transplantation was 42 years (range 20 to 61). Days of neutropenia (AGC<500/\u03bcl) ranged from 2 to 10 (average 5.2). The median length of follow up is 4.0 years. Kaplan-Meier progression-free survival is 38% at 5 years and 35% at 10 years. Currently 26 patients are alive, and 23 are free from progression. Overall survival is 60%.
