    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2353 Poster Board II-330 Background Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) results in accumulation of mature, malignant, monoclonal B cells in blood, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and bone marrow. Patients with CLL have fundamental defects in both humoral and cell-mediated immunity that significantly impact on its clinical course. It is still not known if these immune abnormalities include a decrease of new B- and T-cell mobilization from their production sites. During early lymphocyte development and differentiation, occurring in bone marrow and in thymus, B- and T-cells undergo rearrangements of B-cell and T-cell receptor genes whereby specific chromosomal sequences are excised to produce episomal DNA products identified respectively as T-cell receptor excisional circles (TRECs) and Kappa-deleting recombination excision circles (KRECs). Being stable circular fragments of DNA, TRECs and KRECs do not replicate during the mitotic process required for cell proliferation and, therefore, they are diluted out by cell divisions and are lost when the cells die. Since T-cells leaving the thymus are 70% TRECs+ and KRECs are present randomly in about 50% of neo-produced normal B-cells, the quantification of TRECs and KRECs allows a good estimation of the thymic and bone marrow output. Aim To investigate the extent of neo-synthesis of normal B and T cells in untreated patients with CLL. Patients and Methods Twelve previously untreated CLL patients were enrolled in this study. M:F ratio was 5:1; median age was 66; 7 patients had mutated IgVH genes, while 5 patients had unmutated IgVH genes; all patients were stage A Binet; FISH analysis including del(13q), del(11q), del(17p) and trisomy 12 detected 13q deletion in 6 patients while the other 6 patients presented no abnormalities. TRECs and KRECs were measured in mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood by duplex quantitative Real-Time PCR. This new assay, based on the use of a standard curve prepared with a plasmid containing fragments of TRECs, KRECs and of a reference gene, allows to quantify neo-produced B and T lymphocytes. T-cell subpopulations were determined by flow cytometry as follows: recent thymic emigrants (RTE) as cells with CD4 + CD45RA + CCR7 + CD31 + phenotype, regulatory T cells (Treg), as CD4 + CD25 int/high CD127 low , RTE-Treg as Treg expressing CCR7 + CD31 + CD25 int/high markers, effector memory (T EM ) and central memory (T CM ) T cells as lymphocytes displaying CD4 + CD45RA - CCR7 - and CD4 + CD45RA-CCR7+ phenotype. Results The overall number of CD4+ lymphocytes was increased in chemotherapy-nai\u0308ve patients with CLL (1585/\u03bcl vs 953/\u03bcl; p=0.02). TRECs were significantly higher in CLL patients compared to age-matched healthy controls (2.9/ml vs 1.4/ml; p=0.04), while the proportion of RTE was lower (24.9% vs 32.4%; p=0.02). No significant differences were observed in the percentage of Treg and RTE-Treg as well as of T CM . On the contrary, the percentage of T EM was higher (22.4% vs 10.4%; p=0.01) in CLL patients. The number of KRECs was lower in CLL patients than in controls (3.8/ml vs 7.4/ml; p=0.004). No correlation between IgVH gene mutational status, Ig levels and KRECs was found. Conclusions The neo-synthesis of normal T, with the exception of Treg, and B cells is reduced in patients with CLL compared to controls, even in a good prognosis, chemotherapy-nai\u0308ve subset. The increased number of TRECs+ cells and T EM together with low RTE could be ascribed to the increased number of circulating CD4+ lymphocytes which do not appear to be recently mobilized from the thymus (CD31- cells) or to undergo peripheral expansion, but to accumulate in the peripheral blood. The low number of KRECs compared to normal controls could be interpreted as a consequence of the abnormal leukemic B-cell expansion which may impair normal B cell neo-synthesis. The level of KRECs did not seem to correlate to the mutational status of IgVH genes or the Ig level but a larger number of patients is needed to confirm these preliminary data and to establish whether the analysis of TRECs and KRECs may help clarify the complex immune abnormalities in CLL.
