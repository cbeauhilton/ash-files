    "abstract_text": "Introduction The 5-year survival for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has stagnated for over two decades at about 60% for children, 40% for young adults, and <15% for elderly patients. While most patients achieve remission, approximately 50% will relapse which is generally attributed to the persistence of leukemic stem cells. Interferon \u03b1 (IFN\u03b1) is an effective therapy for patients with AML due to multiple mechanisms of action. However, high serum levels are associated with many adverse effects. In this proof-of-concept study, we used engineered mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) to deliver high concentrations of IFN\u03b1 locally to an AML chloroma, potentially diminishing the poorly tolerated systemic side-effects. Methods Bone marrow MSCs from C57BL/6 mouse were isolated and transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing murine IFN\u03b1 (IFN\u03b1-MSCs) and/or GFP (GFP MSCs). After measuring IFN\u03b1 secretion by ELISA and confirming activity by the induction of the MHC I expression on the transduced cells, the anti-AML activity of these transduced MSCs was assessed by co-culture with the C57BL/6 AML cell line c1498 which expresses DsRed and firefly luciferase (FFluc). Apoptotic cell frequencies and cell cycle phase distributions of leukemia cells with or without MSCs were assessed by flow cytometry. The in vivo validation has been performed by subcutaneous injection of c1498 cells (chloroma) with or without GFP MSCs or IFN\u03b1 MSCs in C57BL/6 mice. Tumor growth was monitored by bioluminescence imaging every 3 or 4 days. Results Flow cytometric analysis and ELISA confirmed the secretion of bio-active of IFN\u03b1 by transduced MSCs (41.5 ng/1E06 MSCs/24h). In co-cultures, the presence of IFN\u03b1 MSCs at the ratio 100:1 (c1498: MSC) significantly decreased the population of c1498 cells mainly by inducing apoptosis compared to MSC-free or GFP MSC co-cultures while no effect was observed on cell cycle distribution. The pro-apoptotic effect of IFN\u03b1 MSCs was then investigated in vivo by subcutaneous injection of c1498 cells with or without MSCs (ratio 10:1) in C57BL/6 mice.The presence of IFN\u03b1 MSCs significantly decreased leukemic cell mass as shown by the bioluminescence of the DsRed+ FFLuc+ c1498 cells. This result was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of the percentage of DsRed + cells in the chloroma. Conclusions This study shows that IFN\u03b1 MSCs present a strong anti-leukemic effect in vitro and in vivo promoting apoptosis and thus decreasing the leukemic burden. Further experiments will focus on a potential synergetic effect with Cytarabine treatment and a preclinical study using human IFN\u03b1 MSCs in a xenograft murine model.
