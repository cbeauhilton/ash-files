    "abstract_text": "Background Physician overwork has long been a problem in Japanese society. Mean weekly working durations are reportedly 70.6 hours. The working hours of hematologists are estimated to be especially long. In addition, there is no payment system for specialist medical care in Japan and there is no difference in payments for treatment between specialists and general physicians. The average hourly wage is $30 for both specialists and general physicians in Japan, while the respective values are $100 and $70 in the United States. Given this situation, we advocate that working hours of Japanese hematologists be reduced by improving their work efficiency. One of the problems lies in dose calculations for anticancer drugs. With the conventional ordering system, the method of rounding the dose fractions varies among physicians and there is a potential risk of incorrect administration. We developed an anticancer drug administration system designed to reduce hematologists\u2019 workloads and improve the appropriateness of anticancer drug dosing. We then examined its efficacy. Methods EGMAIN-GX (Fujitsu Ltd., Japan) version 2 is an electronic medical record system incorporating an ordering function. We developed a drug administration system named Regimen version 4 in order to update the EGMAIN-GX version 2 ordering system. The new system allows dose calculation with a rounding function in which the dose is automatically rounded off to the nearest whole number. Seven hematologists were asked to order five regimens (IDR/araC, Flu/ivBU, R-CHOP, hyper-CVAD, R-ESAHP\uff09for a patient (165 cm in height and weighing 52 kg) using the new and old systems. Times required for ordering and prescribed doses of anticancer drugs were compared between the two systems. Statistical analysis was performed using Student\u2019s t test. Results The mean time and standard deviation (seconds) for ordering are shown in Table 1 . Table 1  Regimen Version 4 Version 2 p- value IDR/araC 41 \u00b1 37 115 \u00b1 33 p < 0.01 Flu/ivBU16 52 \u00b1 14 217 \u00b1 29 p < 0.01 R-CHOP 55 \u00b1 12 45 \u00b1 13 p = 0.16 hyper-CVAD 38 \u00b1 11 103 \u00b1 21 p < 0.01 R-ESAHP 64 \u00b1 27 93 \u00b1 18 p = 0.04 Cumulative time 1543 \u00b1 88 3440 \u00b1 85 p < 0.01 Regimen Version 4 Version 2 p- value IDR/araC 41 \u00b1 37 115 \u00b1 33 p < 0.01 Flu/ivBU16 52 \u00b1 14 217 \u00b1 29 p < 0.01 R-CHOP 55 \u00b1 12 45 \u00b1 13 p = 0.16 hyper-CVAD 38 \u00b1 11 103 \u00b1 21 p < 0.01 R-ESAHP 64 \u00b1 27 93 \u00b1 18 p = 0.04 Cumulative time 1543 \u00b1 88 3440 \u00b1 85 p < 0.01 View Large The time was significantly reduced with version 4 as compared to version 2, except for R-CHOP. The cumulative time was reduced by 54% with version 4. As to the prescribed doses of anticancer drugs, significant differences between the two systems were found in busulfan (42.0 mg vs. 40.7 mg, p < 0.0001; figures rounded off to the nearest whole number in the present system, i.e., 42.0 mg) and rituximab (529 mg vs. 583 mg, p = 0.002; figures rounded down to the nearest 100 in the present system, i.e., 500 mg). Conclusions The new drug administration system significantly reduced the time required for ordering and facilitated appropriate anticancer drug dosing. These results show that the new drug administration system can reduce hematologists\u2019 workloads and also reduce the risk of incorrect administration of anticancer drugs.
