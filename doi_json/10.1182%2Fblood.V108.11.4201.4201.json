    "abstract_text": "The NIHGRI has sponsored a multi-group enterprise to use a variety of approaches to map DNA elements in one per cent of the human genome-the ENCODE Project. As part of this effort we have mapped sites of active transcription (transcriptionally active regions or TARS) for myeloid cells including the undifferentiated and retinoic acid treated promyelocytic NB4 cell line and normal neutrophils, as well as the erythroid cell line K562. The results show a large number of intergenic and intronic transcripts, particularly in neutrophils. One feature of note is the amount of cell type specific intergenic transcription in the HoxA cluster. In addition we have been developing simple methods to map the sites of polyadenylation of RNAs and applied this to several cell types. This method also indicates the presence of polyadenylated transcripts derived from the multiple introns of known genes as well as intergenic regions. In parallel with the transcript mapping, we have been performing microarray based chromatin immunoprecipitation studies (Chip-chip) on several factors, analyzing them on oligonucleotide arrays tiling the ENCODE selected genomic regions. These include various phosphorylated forms of RNA polymerase, various methylated forms of histone H3, certain DNA sequence specific transcription factors, and some other factors either broadly involved in chromatin remodeling or specifically found to be associated with certain sequences in the beta globin cluster. Among other things, our results as well as those of other members of the ENCODE consortium, provide a signature motif commonly associated with promoters.",
