    "abstract_text": "Background During clotting, factors IXa and VIIa participate in the activation of Factor X, leading to thrombin generation. This process occurs on the surface of activated platelets. Activated platelets release an array of proteins that can modulate thrombin generation. This includes platelet factor 4 (PF4), a chemokine that modulates coagulation by promoting protein C activation and by attenuating the anticoagulant activity of activated protein C. PF4 shares significant homology with another protein released in high concentration by platelets, \u03b2-thromboglobulin (\u03b2TG). The physiological effects of \u03b2TG, including effects on blood coagulation, are poorly characterized. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of \u03b2TG on blood coagulation. Methods The effect of purified human \u03b2TG on coagulation was determined using the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), calibrated automated thrombography (4\u00b5M phospholipids \u00b1 1pM tissue factor (TF)) and chromogenic FX and prothrombin activation assays. Mass spectrometry and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) were used to assess the composition of the purified \u03b2TG preparation and to measure protein-protein interactions respectively. Results Mass spectrometry confirmed the absence of TF, FVIIa, FVIIIa, FIXa, FVa, and FXa in the \u03b2TG preparation. In normal pooled plasma, \u03b2TG dose-dependently increased the rate and extent of TF stimulated thrombin generation. In the absence of \u03b2TG, the lagtime was 9\u00b11 min, which was shortened in a dose-dependent manner upon incubation with \u03b2TG (100\u00b5g/ml; 5\u00b11 min, p<0.05). Incubation with \u03b2TG (50\u00b5g/ml) also shortened the APTT (35\u00b11 to 25\u00b11 secs, p<0.05) and reduced the lagtime to thrombin generation (26\u00b15 to 7\u00b11 min, p<0.05) and increased the peak thrombin generation (60\u00b130 to 97\u00b123nM, p<0.05) in the absence of an exogenous TF stimulus. Immunodepleted plasmas and inhibitory antibodies were used to determine the underlying mechanism of action. In FVIII-deficient plasma, thrombin generation was not observed in the absence of an exogenous TF stimulus. However, upon incubation with \u03b2TG (50\u00b5g/ml), thrombin generation was observed and peak thrombin generation increased from 1\u00b11 to 75\u00b112nM IIa (p<0.05). \u03b2TG also shortened the APTT in FVIII-deficient plasma from 131\u00b18 to 103\u00b114 secs (50\u00b5g/ml, p<0.05). The procoagulant effect of \u03b2TG in FVIII-deficient plasma was not inhibited by TF or FVIIa inhibitory antibodies, suggesting that the effect was independent of the intrinsic tenase complex, TF or FVIIa. Interestingly, homologous PF4 did not induce thrombin generation in FVIII-deficient plasma (peak thrombin generation was 75\u00b112nM v 0\u00b10nM IIa upon incubation with 50\u00b5g/ml \u03b2TG and PF4 respectively). The procoagulant effect of \u03b2TG persisted when thrombin generation was independent of FV activation (supplementation of FV-deficient plasma with FVa). In contrast, the effect was not observed when thrombin generation was independent of FX activation (supplementation of FX-deficient plasma with FXa). Collectively, these data raised the possibility that \u03b2TG may modulate FX activation. To investigate this hypothesis, chromogenic FX activation was measured. Cleavage of a FXa-specific chromogenic substrate was observed upon incubation of \u03b2TG with FX, suggesting a direct effect of \u03b2TG upon FX activation. No measurable chromogenic substrate cleavage was observed upon incubation with \u03b2TG or FX alone. In contrast, \u03b2TG did not induce prothrombin activation, measured using a thrombin-specific chromogenic substrate. Using SPR, \u03b2TG was found to bind directly to immobilised FX (KD 1.36\u00b10.7x10 -7 M). The kinetics of the interaction between \u03b2TG and FX was lower than that between FIXa and FX (KD 4.25\u00b11.90 \u00d7 10 -9 M). Conclusion In conclusion, we have identified that \u03b2TG is a potential novel platelet-derived activator of coagulation FX. Moreover, \u03b2TG is capable of inducing thrombin generation in immunodepleted FVIII and FIX-deficient plasma, a finding that may be of translational relevance to patients with haemophilia.
