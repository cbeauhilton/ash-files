    "abstract_text": "Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) represents a heterogeneous group of T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) mainly affecting children and young adults. About 70% of systemic ALCLs are associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation, t(2;5)(p23;35) which fuses the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene on chromosome 2 with the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene on chromosome 5, resulting in the NPM-ALK fusion gene, its over-expression and constitutive kinase activity. Immunophenotypic characterization of human ALCL revealed highly CD30-positive cells of T- or Null-Cell-origin and resulted in promising clinical trials with CD30-coupled antibodies. However, the impact of CD30 on disease development remains unclear and the relationship between NPM-ALK and CD30 has been investigated mostly using cell line models. Syngeneic mouse models of cancer can serve as useful models since the tumors develop in situ where the contribution made by the immune system and the extracellular matrix can be investigated. Here, we focus on the involvement of CD30 in a retroviral murine bone marrow transplantation model of ALCL. In this model, the BM of Lck-Cre-transgenic mice is infected with a MSCV-Stop-NPM-ALK-IRES-EGFP vector leading to expression of NPM-ALK in early T-cells. With a latency of 3-4 months, mice develop lymphomas and die from neoplastic T-cell-infiltration of BM and lymphatic organs. To investigate the impact of abrogation of CD30 signals on the development of NPM-ALK+ ALCL in our model, CD30 knockout mice were crossed with Lck-Cre mice. Both Lck-Cre NPM-ALK CD30 wt and Lck-Cre NPM-ALK CD30 ko recipients develop a human ALCL-like lymphoma with a pure T-cell phenotype characterized by Thy1.2+ cells infiltrating the thymus, lymph nodes, spleen and BM. First results from Lck-Cre NPM-ALK CD30 ko transplanted mice showed impaired disease induction and prolonged survival compared to CD30 wt animals. Moreover, secondary transplantation of NPM-ALK thymic lymphomas led to distinct deceleration of disease development upon CD30 deletion. Microarray analyses have shed some light on the mechanisms underlying the delayed lymphoma progression of CD30 deleted tumors with an upregulation of inflammatory pathways and proteins that are master players in inflammation and immune responses. Further characterization of the role of CD30-mediated immune response in disease progression using this mouse model and immunocompromised mice is ongoing. An improved understanding of how the immune system affects tumor progression will extend the rationale in translational strategies to use immunotherapies for patients with T-NHLs.
