    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Chemo-refractory patients with DLBCL have a particularly poor outcome with standard-of-care treatment (median overall survival of 6 months) and represent a population with a significant unmet medical need (Crump et al, ASCO 2016). CC-122 is a novel oral agent that binds cereblon ubiquitin ligase complex, resulting in degradation of the hematopoietic transcription factors Ikaros and Aiolos. CC-122 has shown promising phase I clinical activity as a single agent or in combination with obinutuzumab in DLBCL and follicular lymphoma (FL) (NCT01421524 Rasco et al, ASH 2013; NCT02417285 Michot et al, ASH 2016). Preliminary data from CC-122 DLBCL-001, a dose escalation study of CC-122 combined with CC-223, CC-292, or rituximab (R), has shown encouraging activity in relapsed/refractory DLBCL (Ribrag et al, ASH 2016). Herein we report updated results including the dose expansion phase and DLBCL subgroup analyses for the CC-122 plus R combination arm of the CC-122 DLBCL-001 study. Methods: CC-122-DLBCL-001 is a phase Ib dose escalation/expansion study of the novel compounds CC-122, CC-223, and CC-292 administered as doublets and triplets in combination with R as well as a CC-122 plus R doublet (Arm D) (NCT02031419). Cohorts of DLBCL and FL patients in the dose expansion phase of R + CC-122 received 3 mg CC-122 as a formulated capsule. All DLBCL subjects in dose expansion were chemo-refractory by eligibility. Study endpoints were: safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, preliminary efficacy (overall response rate [ORR] and complete response [CR]), and blood pharmacodynamic markers of CC-122. DLBCL cell-of-origin and a novel gene expression classifier representing tumor microenvironment content were tested using Nanostring on tumor biopsies and correlated to efficacy (Gandhi et al, ASH Meeting on Lymphoma Biology 2016). Results: As of May 1, 2017, a total of 40 subjects (DLBCL, n=26; FL, n=14) were enrolled in Arm D expansion. Only DLBCL data are described here while FL data are immature and will be reported at a later time. At enrollment, median age was 64 years (range, 33-84), 81% had stage III-IV disease, and 27% had transformed DLBCL. Median number of prior systemic anticancer regimens was 3 (range, 2-6). Eleven (42%) discontinued from the study either due to progressive disease (N=7) or death due to underlying disease (N=4). The most common adverse events (AEs) (grades 1-4) included neutropenia (50%), anemia 19%), peripheral edema (23%), cough, constipation, fatigue, and rash (19% each). Grade 3/4 AEs occurring in more than 1 subject were neutropenia (42%), increased lipase (12%), febrile neutropenia, abdominal pain, fatigue, and pain in extremity (8% each). Nine subjects experienced serious AEs (SAE); 1 SAE of asthenia was suspected to be related to study drugs. CC-122 dose reduction was required in 10 subjects (39%); the most common reason was neutropenia. Median relative dose intensity was 100% of intended dose. Thirteen patients (50%) received at least 1 dose of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. ORR was 39% with a CR rate of 15% in the treated population (n=26). Efficacy results based on subgroup analysis of patients are shown in Table 1. Classifier positive patients had a CR rate of 50% with mPFS not reached compared with 0% CR rate in classifier negative patients and mPFS of 2.9 months. Conclusions : Data from this ongoing study suggest that CC-122 is well-tolerated when combined with rituximab. Promising activity was observed accross DLBCL cell-of-origin in this chemo-refractory patient population at the recommended phase II dose of 3.0 mg/day using CC-122 formulated capsule. Gene expression classifier based on tumor microenvironment content shows a trend towards predicting deeper and durable responses.
