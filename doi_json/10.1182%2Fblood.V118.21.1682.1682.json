    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1682 Background: The introduction of Imatinib has significantly improved the outcome for patients with Ph+ CML. The complete cytogenetic response (CCgR) is a strong and confirmed predictor of improved long-term outcome. According to current recommendations, Imatinib (IM) should be continued indefinitely. However, optimal responders can be eligible for investigational trials of treatment discontinuation. AIMS: This study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 00858806) describes the effects of a policy of intermittent Imatinib (INTERIM) treatment (one month on/one month off) on cytogenetic and molecular responses in a selected population of patients \u2265 65 years old who were receiving treatment with Imatinib for > 2 years and were in stable complete cytogenetic response (CCgR). The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients who maintained CCgR after 1 year of INTERIM. The secondary endpoint was the level of BCR-ABL transcripts during INTERIM METHODS: Cytogenetic and molecular responses were monitored by FISH and RT-Q-PCR every 3 months. The definition of CCgR, and of CCgR loss was based on CBA of marrow metaphases which was performed at baseline and in all the patients who became FISH positive (BCR-ABL\u2013positive nuclei > 1%). Major molecular response (MMR), corresponding to a 3-log reduction in BCR-ABL transcript level from the standardized baseline, was defined as BCR-ABL \u22640.1% IS and was indicated as MR 3.0 . For the purposes of this study, complete molecular response (CMR) was defined as a 4-log reduction in BCR-ABL transcript level (<0.01% IS ), with a sensitivity of at least 10,000 ABL copies, and is indicated as MR 4.0 . In case of loss of CCgR or MMR, Ph+ additional cytogenetic abnormalities (ACA) and BCR-ABL kinase domain (KD) point mutation analysis were also performed. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients have been enrolled. Six patients (8%) lost CCgR (CBA positive), and 3 other patients became FISH positive while remaining CBA negative. At 12 months, the probability of maintaining CBA negativity was 92% (95% CI 86\u201398%), while the probability of maintaining FISH negativity was 87% (95% CI 79\u201394%). None of the factors that were examined by univariate and multivariate analysis were found to be associated with an higher probability of either loosing the CCgR (CBA) or showing a FISH positivity (> 1%), with the exception of the duration of imatinib therapy (HR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.008\u20130.73, P =.01). Among patients with prior Imatinib treatment longer or shorter than 48 months, the probability of maintaining FISH negativity was 94% (95% CI 88\u2013100%) vs 71% (95% CI 53\u201389%), respectively, HR = 0.23 ( P =.007). All the 6 patients who lost CCgR regained the CCgR with daily Imatinib, at the same dose, defined by FISH negativity after 3 to 9 months (4/6 also CBA negative, 2 patients refused bone marrow aspiration). At baseline, all but one patient (99%) were in MMR (MR 3.0 , BCR-ABL \u22640.1% IS ), and 63 patients (83%) were in MR 4.0 (<0.01% IS ). After one year of intermittent Imatinib, 18/76 patients (24%) lost MR 3.0 and 25/63 (39%) patients lost MR 4.0 . No patient lost complete hematologic response, progressed to accelerated or blastic phase, developed ACA in Ph+ cells, or developed BCR-ABL mutations. After one year, the remaining 70 patients were allowed to go back to continuous treatment, or to continue the intermittent treatment. During the first six months of follow-up (month 13 to 18), 1 of 70 discontinued Imatinib for atrial fibrillation and 9 of 70 went back to continuous treatment because FISH negativity loss (1 patient) or MMR (MR 3.0 ) loss (8 patients). All the patients continue to be regularly observed and monitored and the first twelve months of follow-up will be presented. CONCLUSIONS: The intermittent use of imatinib in older patients in stable CCgR after continuous imatinib treatment results in the transient loss of the CCgR in a minority (8%) of the patients. However, the disease burden at the molecular level significantly increased. A policy of intermittent treatment may be an alternative both to chronic continuous treatment and to treatment discontinuation, particularly in the elderly. However, a longer follow up is required before drawing final conclusions.
