    "abstract_text": "PMBL is a distinct clinicopathologic entity characterized by young age, female preponderance, localized disease, prominent sclerosis and CD30+. Gene expression profiling reveals a unique molecular signature, distinct from other DLBCL subtypes, with similarity to classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) (J Exp Med 198: 851, 2003). HL is typically CD20 negative whereas PMBL has robust CD20 staining. As with HL, the risk of local failure after anthracycline-based therapy in PMBL has led to routine mediastinal radiation. Given the young median age, female predominance and high cure rates, long-term toxicities from secondary malignancies and coronary artery disease can be life threatening. We prospectively evaluated the role of DA-EPOCH\u00b1 R without routine radiation in 44 patients with untreated PMBL. The first 18 patients received DA-EPOCH alone and the subsequent 26 received DA-EPOCH+R. DA-EPOCH was administered for 6\u20138 cycles as described ( Blood 99 : 2685 , 2002 ). Most patients had adverse prognostic features with bulky disease, elevated LDH and extranodal sites, which were balanced among the 2 groups. Patient Characteristics Characteristics . All Patients .

Analysis of 40 cases showed CD20+ 40/40 (100%), CD10+ 2/30 (7%), BCL-6+ 21/26 (81%), MUM-1+ 10/24 (42%) and high MIB-1 with median (range) of 82% (54\u201398). At a median potential follow-up of 9.5 and 4.2 years, EFS and OS are shown below for DA-EPOCH and DA-EPOCH-R, respectively. Rituximab was associated with a significantly improved EFS (p=.038) and OS (p=0.023) by 2-tailed exact log-rank test with caveats associated with any non-randomized comparison. Three patients on DA-EPOCH-R had positive PET and biopsy after treatment. One received radiation (event), one recieved salvage chemotherapy and radiation (event), and one no further treatment after biopsy. DA-EPOCH-R is highly effective in PMBL with OS of 100% and obviated the need for radiation/surgery in 23/26 (88%) patients. Rituximab may significantly improve EFS and OS with DA-EPOCH-based treatment. Accrual continues.
