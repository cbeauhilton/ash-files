    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4356 Introduction: Prognosis of elderly patients (age>60 years) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is poor as compared to younger patients with a higher incidence of cardiac co-morbidities. With standard induction therapy, complete remission (CR) is achieved in 35% to 50% of elderly patients. However, the induction anthracycline containing chemotherapy related mortality is in this population has been reported to be approximately 30%. We attempted to decrease this by replacing the anthracycline with topotecan. Alternative therapies are needed that are less toxic but equally efficacious. In a phase I/II trial of the combination of topotecan, fludarabine, cytarabine and G-CSF (T-FLAG) in elderly AML and MDS, there was 50% CR and 15% treatment related deaths. In this study, we report patients >60 years of age treated with T-FLAG as an initial therapy for AML at our institute. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of elderly patients with AML treated with T-FLAG at our institution. Elderly patients were defined as more than 60 years of age. IRB approval was obtained for the study. All patients received topotecan 2mg/m 2 , fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 , and cytarabine 2000 mg/m 2 all given over 30 min from day 1 to day 4 and G-CSF 400 \u03bc g/m2/day from the day 5 to neutrophil counts recovery. International working group criteria was used to assess responses. All statistical analysis was done using SAS statistical software. Descriptive statistics were used. Progression free survival was defined from the time of diagnosis to progression, death or last follow up, whichever comes first. Overall survival and progression free survival was calculated using Kaplan and Meier method. Results: Thirteen elderly patients were treated with T-FLAG. The median age of diagnosis was 73 years (Range: 60\u201386 years). There were 10 male and 3 female patients. Ten (77%) patients had complex cytogenetics. Cardiomyopathy (EF 500/\u03bc L) was 22 days (Range: 10\u201347 days). Conclusions: In this study of unfavorable risk group elderly patients, T-FLAG induction chemotherapy results in comparable remission rates with low induction chemotherapy related mortality. It may be an alternative regimen for elderly patients with complex cytogenetics or patients who cannot tolerate anthracyclines. More studies are needed to confirm these results. This however, may be useful to bridge patients to transplant or maintenance demethylating agents to improve survival. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
