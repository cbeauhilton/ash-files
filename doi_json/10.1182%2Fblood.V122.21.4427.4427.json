    "abstract_text": "Although the introduction of bortezomib and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) has led to improved outcomes in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), the disease remains incurable. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, is widely used in the treatment of MM and has resulted in marked therapeutic effects; however, this therapy is often complicated by peripheral neuropathy (PN), of which grade \u22653 PN is dose-limiting toxicity and can necessitate cessation of therapy. Subcutaneous administration of bortezomib can reduce the incidence of PN; however, among cases of PN that still occur, 24% are grade 2 PN and 6% are grade 3 PN. These data suggest that the incidence of PN higher than grade 2 is not attenuated by the subcutaneous delivery of bortezomib. In addition, patients often become refractory to bortezomib after long-term use. In an effort to identify potent and well-tolerated agents, clinical trials of novel agents (e.g., carfilzomib, pomalidomide, and monoclonal antibody against CS-1) are being conducted both in patients with newly diagnosed MM and in those with relapsed/refractory disease. We previously reported that 1\u2019-acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA) obtained from the rhizomes of the plant Languas galanga induces cell death of MM cells in vitro and in vivo through inhibition of NF-\u03baB-related functions ( Cancer Res, 2005; 65: 4417). Subsequently, we developed several ACA analogs based on quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis to develop more potent NF-\u03baB inhibitors, and successfully synthesized a novel benzhydrol-type analog of ACA, named TM-233, that exerted potent growth inhibition against various MM cells (U266, RPMI8226, and MM-1S cells) in a dose- and time-dependent manner when compared with ACA ( Chem Pharm Bull., 2008; 56: 1490). Further, TM-233 inhibited constitutive phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 and down-regulated the expression of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein. TM-233 directly bound and activated the transcription of the Mcl-1 gene promoter. Mcl-1 is the downstream molecule of STAT3; therefore, these results suggest that TM-233 induces cell death in MM cells with down-regulated Mcl-1 via modulation of the JAK/STAT pathway. In addition, we examined the DNA-binding activity of NF-\u03baB in TM-233-treated MM cells and found that NF-\u03baB was inhibited by TM-233. Further, Western blotting showed that TM-233 rapidly decreased the nuclear expression of NF-\u03baB but increased the accumulation of NF-\u03baB in the cytosol, suggesting that TM-233 inhibits the translocation of NF-\u03baB from the cytosol to the nucleus. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that the p50/RelA dimer of NF-\u03baB was located in the cytosol and not in the nucleus in TM-233-treated MM cells. We then examined the effects of TM-233 on bortezomib-resistant MM cells. Bortezomib-resistant MM cell lines (i.e., KMS-11/BTZ and OPM-2/BTZ) were established by limiting dilution. We found that these cells have a unique point mutation, G322A, in the gene encoding the proteasome \u03b25 subunit ( Leukemia 2010; 24: 1506). TM-233, but not bortezomib, inhibited cellular growth and induced cell death in KMS-11/BTZ and OPM-2/BTZ cells in a time- (0-48 hours) and dose- (0-5 \u03bcM) dependent manner. Furthermore, the combination of low-dose TM-233 (less than 2 \u03bcM) and bortezomib (10 nM) significantly induced cell death in bortezomib-resistant MM cells via inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity. These results indicate that TM-233 could overcome bortezomib resistance in MM cells by acting via different mechanisms from those of bortezomib. In conclusion, TM-233 induced cell death in MM cells, and this effect was mediated through the JAK/STAT and NF-\u03baB dual-signaling pathways. These data indicate that TM-233 might be a more potent and more specific NF-\u03baB inhibitor than that of original compound (ACA), and might be able to overcome bortezomib-resistance in MM cells. Therefore, further studies investigating clinical approaches, including combination therapy, are warranted. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
