    "abstract_text": "Background: Chemotherapeutic agents can cause severe oral and gastrointestinal mucositis, for which there is currently no treatment. Previous research demonstrates that palifermin - keratinocyte growth factor - is potentially antimucotoxic, reducing the duration and severity of oral mucositis after intense chemotherapy in hematological cancers. The primary aim of this study was to determine palifermin effectiveness in ameliorating chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea and oral mucositis incidence. Palifermin adverse events were also assessed. Methods: Retrospective observational study involving patients with hematological malignancies undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation after myelotoxic therapy. All the patients received antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral prophylaxis. Patients being treated with palifermin to decrease the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis (Palifermin Group) were compared to a control group of patients who did not receive palifermin (Control Group). Palifermin was administered during 3 consecutive days, before and after myelotoxic therapy in a 60 \u03bcg/Kg daily intravenous dose. Results: Twenty-four patients were included, 8 in Palifermin Group and 16 in Control Group. Baseline malignancies were Hodgkin and non Hodgkin lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and multiple myeloma. All patients underwent autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation after the following conditioning regimes: BEAM, BuCy, and Mel200 respectively. In Palifermin Group, 62.5% were male, mean age 47.6\u00b113.0 years, mean disease duration of 22.3\u00b110.1 months (N=8). In Control Group 56.3% were male, mean age 45.8\u00b112.1 years (N=16). Mean performance status (Karnofsky Index) was 80\u00b114.1% and 71.3\u00b115.1%, in each group, respectively. No statistically significant differences between Palifermin and Control Groups were found regarding the degree of diarrhoea, although in the Palifermin Group the majority of patients presented a grade 2 (N=3) and in the Control Group a grade 3 (N=6). In the Palifermin Group there was a tendency for a lower incidence of hypoalbuminemia [12.5% (Palifermin Group) vs. 50% (Control Group)], which corresponded to a significant lower difference in the needs for receiving parenteral nutrition ( P =0.011). Nevertheless, these findings were not translated in less febrile episodes or less iv antibiotic therapy days. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding the degree of oral mucositis, the number of days of analgesic opioids use, and the number of hospitalization days, most probably due to the small sample considered. The most common adverse events in the Palifermin Group were reversible erythema and edema of the face and upper trunk that have occurred only in 3 patients. Weight increase was mild and similar in both groups of patients [Median weight increase\u00b1SD: 1,0\u00b11,7 Kg (Palifermin Group) vs 2,0\u00b12,5 Kg (Control group)]. Conclusion: Gastrointestinal and oral mucositis are common consequences of cancer therapy with a direct and significant impact on the quality of life and care costs, also affecting patient\u2019s survival. Our exploratory study shows that palifermin treatment is well tolerated, potentially reducing diarrhoea and the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, and significantly reducing the needs for parenteral nutrition. However further studies with an increased number of patients will be necessary to provide more evidence concerning palifermin efficacy in the management of these cancer therapy\u2019s debilitating side-effects."
