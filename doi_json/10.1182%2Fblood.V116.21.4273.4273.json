    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4273 Introduction: Pulmonary hypertension is a common and serious cardiovascular complication in patients with thalassemia intermedia and sickle cell disease. Circulating platelet and erythrocyte fragments, as well as cell-free hemoglobin from intravascular hemolysis, may contribute to nitric oxide depletion, intimal proliferation, and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Splenectomy has been also been associated with pulmonary hypertension in some studies. Ineffective erythropoiesis, via release of PLGF and elevation of other proinflammitory cytokines, has also been associated with pulmonary hypertension. However, the risk for pulmonary hypertension in thalassemia major patients remains controversial, with prevalence estimates ranging from 10%-60%. We report echocardiography results from 80 thalassemia major patients enrolled in the Early Detection of Iron Cardiomyopathy Trial (EDICT) at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. Methods: Patients were enrolled from August 2004 until May 2009 in a combined cross-sectional and observational trial probing for early predictors of cardiac dysfunction. Patient visits were scheduled within one week of transfusion. All patients underwent echocardiography and cardiac MRI analysis within 4 months of each other; most were performed during the same clinical visit (median time between scans one day). Comprehensive assessments of pulmonary artery pressure (tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation velocities), systolic function, and diastolic function were performed using two dimensional imaging, M-mode, and routine and tissue Doppler. All images were collected by experienced echocardiography technicians and analyzed by the principal investigator. Three to five beat averages were used to improve measurement stability. Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet was only reported if a full envelope was recognized; at our institution, the upper limit of normal for TR jet is 2.7 m/s. Results: Patient demographics are summarized in Table 1 . Patients were gender-balanced and well distributed between 11 and 47 years of age. Patients who had been splenectomized (N=34) tended to be older. Iron overload was severe, with a mean liver iron concentration of 12.4 \u00b1 14.2 mg/g dry weight. Roughly half of the patients had detectable cardiac iron and 9% had overt left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF < 56%). TR jet was detectable in 62/80 patients. Only one patient exhibited pulmonary artery hypertension (TR jet 2.9 m/s), however this patient also had severe cardiac iron overload and overt left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction (LVEF 42.7%, E/E' 10). Two patients had TR jets of 2.6 ms and three had TR jets of 2.5 m/s. Pulmonary insufficiency jets were normal in all patients. TR velocity did not correlate with age, cardiac index, cardiac iron or liver iron, but demonstrated a weak (r=0.29, p=0.02) association with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (E/E\u2032). Discussion: The EDICT patient cohort suggests a low risk for pulmonary hypertension in well-transfused thalassemia major patients. The single elevated TR jet was explained by iron cardiomyopathy and normalized (2.2 m/s) after two years of aggressive chelation therapy. TR velocities at the upper limits of normal (2.5-2.7 m/s) were observed in five patients; these have been associated with poor outcomes in some sickle cell disease cohorts, but not in thalassemia major. Long-term surveillance remains critical as pulmonary hypertension risk may increase with age.  Parameter . All Patients . Splenectomized . Nonsplenectomized .
