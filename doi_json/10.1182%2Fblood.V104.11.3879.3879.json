    "abstract_text": "Objective To explore the effects of chloride channels on the regulations of platelet cytoplasmic free calcium concentration ([Ca 2+ ]i) and platelet aggregation (PAG). Methods Platelet were separated freshly and then activated by thrombin; The chloride channel blockers 4,4\u2032-diisothiocyano-2, 2\u2032-disulfonic acid stilbene (DIDS) or niflumic acid (NFA), and calcium channel blockers 1-{\u03b2-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]- 4-methoxyphenethyl}- 1H - imidazole hydrochloride (SK&F96365) or Nifedipine were added to react with the activated platelets. The effects of each agent on platelet [Ca 2+ ]i and PAG were detected. The combine effects and the interactions among chloride channel blockers (DIDS, NFA) and calcium channel blockers (SK&F96365, Nifedipine) were also investigated. Results Both DIDS and NFA [the concentration were12.5, 25, 50, 100 and 200\u03bcmol\u2022L \u22121 respectively] could inhibit the PAG induced by thrombin (1U/ml) and the effect was dose-dependent. Compared with the control, they had no significant effects on resting [Ca 2+ ]i. Compare with the control group, DIDS (100\u03bcmol\u2022L \u22121) , SK&F96365 (100\u03bcmol\u2022L \u22121 ) and Nifedipine (100\u03bcmol\u2022L \u22121 ) could significantly reduce the PAG, Ca 2+ release and Ca 2+ influx activated by thrombin in platelet ( P <0.05). DIDS (100\u03bcmol\u2022L \u22121 ) and SK&F96365 (100\u03bcmol\u2022L \u22121 ) could enhance each other\u2019s effect on reducing the PAG, Ca 2+ release and Ca 2+ influx ( P <0.05). DIDS (100\u03bcmol\u2022L \u22121 ) and Nifedipine (100\u03bcmol\u2022L \u22121 ) could enhance each other\u2019s effect on reducing Ca 2+ release ( P <0.05). NFA (100\u03bcmol\u2022L \u22121 ) and SK&F96365 (100\u03bcmol\u2022L \u22121 ) could weaken each other\u2019s effect on Ca 2+ release ( P <0.05). NFA (100\u03bcmol\u2022L \u22121 ) and Nifedipine (100\u03bcmol\u2022L \u22121 ) could weaken each other\u2019s effect on PAG, Ca 2+ release and Ca 2+ influx activated by thrombin in platelet ( P <0.05). Conclusion The chloride channel blockers DIDS and NFA have no effect on the resting [Ca 2+ ]i and the leak calcium influx of platelet. DIDS can inhibit the Ca 2+ release, Ca 2+ influx and PAG of platelet induced by thrombin, while NFA can only inhibit the Ca 2+ release of platelet induced by thrombin. There are interactions between chloride channel blockers and calcium channel blockers in resting [Ca 2+ ]i and PAG of platelet. The opening of chloride channel can influence the cellular calcium movement of platelet."
