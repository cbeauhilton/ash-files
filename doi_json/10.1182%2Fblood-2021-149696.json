    "abstract_text": "Background The BCR-ABL -negative Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal stem cell disorders characterized by constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway that include Polycythemia Vera, Essential Thrombocytosis, Primary (PMF) and Secondary Myelofibrosis (SMF). Splenomegaly is a characteristic feature of MPNs that can be ameliorated by JAK inhibitors (JAKi). Up-to one-third of MPN patients also experience portal hypertension (PH). Thrombosis of the splanchnic circulation is the most widely recognized etiology of PH in MPNs, however PH also occurs in the absence of intra-abdominal thrombosis. The influence of PH on outcomes of JAKi therapy in MPN patients has not been characterized. To this end, we aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of JAKi therapy in MPN patients complicated by PH with and without underlying splanchnic circulation thrombosis (ST). Methods All patients with MPNs assessed at Princess Margaret Hospital between 01/1998 and 01/2021 were identified from the MPN program's database. Patients who had undergone esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and had endoscopic evidence of PH, namely esophageal or gastric varices or portal hypertensive gastropathy were included. The study population was further limited to patients who started JAKi therapy following diagnosis of PH. Outcomes were compared between patients with and without underlying ST. The primary endpoint was palpable spleen reduction at 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints included best palpable spleen reduction within one year of starting JAKi, improvement in PH severity as determined by serial EGD assessments during JAKi therapy, overall survival, and \u2265grade 3treatment emergent adverse events. Statistical differences in the frequencies of baseline characteristics were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank sum and Chi-Square tests. Overall-survival (OS) estimates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method using STATA/IC 16.1 software. Results All MPN patients with evidence of PH on endoscopy who started JAKi therapy after diagnosis of PH were included (n=33). Thirteen patients experienced ST prior to the start of JAKi. The proportion of younger patients and those with PH-related complications (i.e., variceal bleeding and/or ascites) was higher in patients with underlying ST (5/20 [25%] vs 9/13 [69%], p=0.01). The median palpable spleen change at approximately 24 weeks of therapy and the best palpable spleen reduction within the first year of therapy was -40.5% ([-100%[ -[+100%]) and -50% ([-100%]-0%) in the entire cohort, respectively. Better spleen responses with JAKi therapy were observed in PH patients without prior ST compared to those with underlying ST (median palpable spleen change at approximately 24 weeks was -58% (-24%-(-100%)] (n=13) vs -26.5% ([-100%]-[+100%]) (n=9), p=0.062; median best palpable spleen change at any time within 1 year of JAKi therapy start was -71% ([-14%]) -[-100%]) (n=17) vs -35% ([0%-[-100%]) (n=9), p=0.045). Of 21 patients with serial EGDs during JAKi treatment, improvement in PH severity as observed in 8 (38%). There were no differences in survival between patients with and without prior ST. Grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events included anemia (5/33 [15%]), thrombocytopenia (5/33 [15%]), neutropenia (1/33 [3%]), and suspected Wernicke encephalopathy associated with Momelotinib (1/33 [3%]). Conclusion: In this observational study, JAK inhibitor therapy appears to be safe and effective in MPN patients complicated by PH, with a trend towards improved spleen responses among portal hypertensive patients without splanchnic circulation thrombosis.
