    "abstract_text": "Background: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a novel treatment modality for patients with R/R LBCL. Limited information exists regarding patients' views of CAR T cell therapy. Our research aimed to better understand patients' needs by capturing their expectations/concerns, current well-being, and treatment experiences during the beginning stages of CAR T cell therapy in the clinical trial setting. Methods: Patients with R/R LBCL from 2 ongoing trials of the investigational, CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy liso-cel (TRANSCEND WORLD [NCT03484702] or PLATFORM [NCT03310619]) were invited to participate in an optional interview component. Semistructured interviews were conducted to gain insight about patients' experience with CAR T cell therapy in the clinical trials. Interviews of \u22641 hour (in-person or over the phone) were conducted in parallel with screening procedures (interview 1), after leukapheresis (interview 2), and up to 3 days after liso-cel infusion (interview 3). Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. MAXQDA (VERBI GmbH, Berlin, Germany) qualitative analysis software was used to manage and thematically organize interview transcript data to identify key concepts related to each research objective. Previously reported results of interview 1 showed a high perception of unmet needs, lack of alternative options, and expectations for positive outcomes. The analysis presented here primarily focused on interviews 2 and 3. Denominators shown in the Results vary by question as some patients skipped questions. Results: A total of 75 interviews were analyzed, including 35, 24, and 16 patients at interviews 1, 2, and 3, respectively, across sites in the US (n = 14), Europe (n = 26), and Japan (n = 2). Among 42 patients who completed \u22651 interview, the mean age was 62 years and 69% were male. Treatment Experience: Of 24 patients who completed interview 2, 22 (92%) reported positive experiences during leukapheresis and 16 (67%) reported the procedure was as expected. Patients thought the most difficult part of leukapheresis was the length of the procedure (n = 8/21 [38%]). Of 15 patients who provided feedback on lymphodepleting chemotherapy, a majority reported that it was as expected (n = 8 [53%]) or easier than expected (n = 3 [20%]); when asked about the most difficult part, many patients (n = 7/17 [41%]) discussed side effects (eg, nausea, fatigue, and lack of appetite). Of patients who described liso-cel infusion as different than expected, differences included easier (n = 12/13 [92%]) or quicker (n = 3/12 [25%]) than expected, and 5/12 (42%) reported few/no side effects within 3 days post-infusion. Over half of patients (n = 8/14 [57%]) reported that the infusion, as a whole, was not difficult. Changes over Time: At interviews 1, 2, and 3, respectively, 47% (n = 14/30), 47% (n = 9/19), and 69% (n = 9/13) of patients reported hoping for successful treatment. Similarly, patients generally had fewer concerns later in the process, with 21 (64%) and 11 (33%) of 33 patients reporting side-effect and treatment efficacy concerns, respectively, during interview 1 vs 5 (33%) and 3 (20%) of 15 patients, respectively, during interview 3. At time of enrollment, most patients (n = 21/34 [62%]) were able to function normally or with minimal impact from their lymphoma, although most reported some symptoms like fatigue, pain, or stomach problems. At interview 1, 14 (40%) of 35 patients were employed; most patients reported no changes in their work life at interviews 2 (n = 19/20 [95%]) and 3 (n = 11/12 [92%]). From enrollment to immediately post-infusion, the physical health of most patients remained stable (n = 4/16 [25%]) or deteriorated (n = 9/16 [56%]). However, most patients (n = 14/15 [93%]) reported feeling positive at interview 3. Conclusions: This study provided the unique opportunity to gather feedback directly from patients participating in clinical trials of liso-cel therapy, specifically during the initial treatment stages. The overall impression of the treatment was positive, with most patients reporting that study procedures were easier than expected. The results of this qualitative research provide useful insight into the motivations, expectations, and experiences of patients with R/R LBCL receiving liso-cel therapy, which can inform the design of health care support systems and future clinical trials to better meet patients' needs.
