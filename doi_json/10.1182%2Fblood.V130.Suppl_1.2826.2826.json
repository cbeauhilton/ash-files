    "abstract_text": "Background : Axi-cel, an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, has shown promising efficacy in refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the ZUMA-1 trial with an objective response rate (ORR) of 82%, including 54% complete responses (CRs; Locke et al. AACR 2017. #9986). Checkpoint expression within the tumor environment, at baseline and post-CAR T cell infusion, suggests that checkpoint blockade could augment axi-cel activity (Galon et al. ASCO 2017. #3025; Vranic et al. PLOS One. 2016). ZUMA-6 is a phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of combination treatment with axi-cel and the anti-PD-L1 antibody, atezolizumab (atezo), in patients with refractory DLBCL (NCT02926833). Methods : Eligible patients (\u2265 18 years) had received \u2265 1 prior CD20-targeting and anthracycline-containing regimen with stable or progressive disease to last line of therapy or early relapse after autologous stem cell transplant, had an ECOG \u2264 1, and had adequate bone marrow and organ function. Patients received low-dose conditioning with fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 /day and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m 2 /day \u00d7 3 days, followed by axi-cel infusion at a target dose of 2 \u00d7 10 6 cells/kg. In the phase 1 portion of the study, in cohorts 1, 2, and 3, atezo 1200 mg was administered every 21 days for 4 doses starting on day 21, 14, and 1 post-axi-cel infusion, respectively. This report describes phase 1 results from the first 2 dosing cohorts. The primary endpoint of phase 1 was incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) within 21 days from the first atezo dose. Secondary endpoints included frequency of adverse events (AEs), ORR, and biomarkers. Results : As of the June 23, 2017 data cut-off, there were 6 patients dosed with axi-cel and atezo (3 in cohort 1; 3 in cohort 2). Median age was 52 years (range, 29-66). Patients had a median of 3 prior therapies (range, 2-4), 4 had disease progression as best response to last prior treatment before study entry, and 3 had an International Prognostic Index score of 3 or 4. No DLTs were observed in either cohort and there was no evidence of worsening or recurrent AEs consistent with cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurologic events (NE), or other CAR T cell-related toxicities following atezo administration in either dosing schedule. All patients experienced at least 1 AE, the majority of which were cytopenias attributed to conditioning chemotherapy. The most common grade \u2265 3 AEs were anemia (67%), encephalopathy (67%), and hyponatremia (50%). Incidences of grade \u2265 3 CRS and NE were 33% and 67%, respectively. Five patients were evaluable for response; ORR was 100% (5/5) with 1 CR observed. One CR and 2 partial responses are ongoing. All 6 ZUMA-6 patients demonstrated a CAR T cell area under the curve in the first 28 days (AUC 28 ) that was over 2-fold higher than the median observed in patients with DLBCL enrolled in ZUMA-1 (ZUMA-6 range, 816-2301 days \u00d7 cells/uL; ZUMA-1 median, 374 days \u00d7 cells/uL). A second peak of > 2-fold over the pre-atezo level in serum concentrations of the immune-modulating cytokine interferon gamma was also observed 1 week after the first atezo infusion in 4/5 evaluable patients. Cohort 3 is currently enrolling and updated results, including those from cohort 3, will be presented. Conclusions : In this ongoing phase 1 study, PD-L1 blockade with atezo following axi-cel infusion appeared to have a manageable safety profile, and translational evidence suggested an enhancing pharmacodynamic action on CAR T cells. Results collected thus far support further evaluation of the combination in the phase 2 portion of the study. Disclosures Locke: Kite Pharma: Consultancy; Cellular Biomedicine Group Inc: Consultancy.
