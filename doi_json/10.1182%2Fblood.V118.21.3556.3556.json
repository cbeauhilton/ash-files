    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3556 IDH1/2 , TET2 and DNMT3A mutations have been reported in myeloid malignancies including de novo AML. In this study, we have analyzed the frequency and prognostic impact of these mutations in a large retrospective cohort of patients (pts) with secondary AML (SA) which encompass myelodysplasia-related changes (MRC) AML and therapy-related (TR) AML according to the WHO classification. Bone marrow samples were collected from 247 pts at diagnosis with SA and the mutational status of IDH1/2, TET2 and DNMT3A genes together with other genes frequently mutated in AML ( NPM1, FLT-3, N and K-RAS, WT1 ) was determined by Sanger sequencing or high resolution melting analysis. The cohort of 247 pts consisted in 201 MRC AML and in 46 TR AML, 39.5% of which with a normal karyotype (NK). The frequency of IDH1/2 , TET2 and DNMT3A mutations was 12.6, 19.8 and 4.5%, respectively. Two pts had both TET2 and IDH1/2 mutations, 2 pts had TET2 and DNMT3A mutations and 5 pts had both IDH1/2 and DNMT3A mutations showing that these mutations were not mutually exclusive in SA. IDH1/2 and TET2 mutations were significantly more frequent in MRC AML (14.1 and 22.3%) than in TR AML (6.4 and 8.7%) ( P =0.04 and P =0.03) while the frequency of DNMT3A mutations was identical in the two subgroups. The SA pts harbouring at least one IDH1/2 or TET2 or DNMT3A mutation were significantly older ( P <0.0001) and presented higher leukocyte count and lower MCV ( P <0.05) than unmutated pts. Percentage of blasts in the bone marrow was similar in the two groups. Karyotype was normal in 48% of the IDH1/2 or TET2 or DNMT3A mutated pts and 18% of the unmutated patients, indicating that these mutations were strongly associated with NK ( P < 0.001). A statistically significant link was found between TET2 or IDH1/2 or DNMT3A mutations and NPM1 mutations, but not with FLT-3, N/K-RAS or WT1 mutations. Complete remission rate and overall survival were evaluated in a group of 158 pts which had received intensive chemotherapy at diagnosis, and were identical in the IDH1/2 or TET2 or DNMT3A mutated and unmutated groups. These mutations did significantly influence survival neither in the subgroup of pts with normal karyotype, nor in the subgroup of MRC-AML, or TR-AML which were of very poor prognosis. These data show that IDH1/2 , TET2 or DNMT3A mutations could modify the clinical presentation without impact on prognosis. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
