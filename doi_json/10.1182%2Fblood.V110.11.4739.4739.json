    "abstract_text": "[Purpose] It is considered that human myeloma cells have the constitutively high NF-kB activity involved in survival and proliferation. PPAR (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) \u00df is ubiquitously expressed in all cells and considered to be involved in the lipid metabolism and regulating the inflammatory response and cell proliferation. We already have found that adrenal cortex hormones (DHEA and DHEA-S etc), dexamethasone (Dex) and baicalein augmented the expression of reporter gene. However, it remain to be clarified the role of PPAR\u00df in human myeloma cells. We focus on the mechanism of PPAR\u00df suppressed NF-kB activity. [Method] To know NF-kB activity of human myeloma cells, we performed EMSA with NF-kB consensus oligo. To investigate NF-kB and PPAR\u00df after stimulation of PPAR agonist, we did EMSA with NF-kB and PPAR consensus oligo. To confirm whether it is repression according the NF-kB activity suppression accompanying PPAR\u00df activation to the interaction of PPAR\u00df and NF-kB, we conducted immunoprecipitation - western blot analysis. To check whether the expression of NF-kB target genes ( cIAP1, Bcl-xL , etc) were suppressed after stimulation of PPAR agonist, we performed RT-PCR analysis. [Result and discussion] It was suggested that human myeloma cell lines have constitutive NF-kB activity, and its activity mainly regulated p50. NF-kB activity and its target genes were repressed by stimulation of PPAR agonist. From the above, it was suggested that the activated PPAR\u00df interacted NF-kB and then its activity was suppressed.",
