    "abstract_text": "Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the standard treatment for eradicating BCR-ABL-positive progenitor cells in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); however, disease often relapses upon drug discontinuation because TKIs do not effectively eliminate leukemic stem cells (LSC). The development of novel strategies aimed at eradicating LSC without harming normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) is essential for the cure of CML patients. The generation of LSC-directed therapy relies on the identification of novel molecular pathways that selectively regulate LSC function independent of BCR-ABL. The Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4(KLF4) is a transcription factor that can either activate or repress gene transcription acting as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor depending on the cellular context. Analysis of a published dataset from chronic phase CML patients revealed elevated levels of KLF4 in LSC compared to progenitor cells indicating that KLF4 is likely implicated in LSC regulation. To study the role of KLF4 in LSC function, we used a CML mouse model combining somatic deletion of the Klf4 gene and retroviral transduction and transplantation of HSC. In contrast to mice receiving BCR-ABL-transduced Klf4 fl/fl HSC that developed and succumbed to CML, mice transplanted with BCR-ABL-transduced Klf4 \u0394/\u0394 ( Klf4 fl/fl Vav-iCre + ) HSC showed a progressive loss of leukemia despite an initial expansion of myeloid leukemic cells, which led to increased overall survival. This inability to sustain CML in the absence of KLF4 was caused by attrition of LSC in bone marrow and the spleen. Furthermore, deletion of KLF4 impaired the ability of LSC to recapitulate leukemia in secondary recipients suggesting a loss of self-renewal capacity. In contrast to LSC, KLF4 deletion led to increased self-renewal of normal HSC assessed by serial competitive transplantation. To identify KLF4 target genes involved in LSC self-renewal, we performed a global gene expression analysis using Klf4 \u0394/\u0394 LSC purified by cell sorting from leukemic mice. Analysis of gene expression in Klf4 \u0394/\u0394 LSC revealed significant upregulation of G\u03b2L, a component of mTOR complexes. Finally, we identified that KLF4 binds to G\u03b2L promoter by Chip-Seq analysis and that silencing resulted in inhibition of mTORC2 but not mTORC1 activity in 32D-BCR-ABL-positive CML cells. Our findings suggest that KLF4 transcriptionally represses G\u03b2L expression in LSC and that mTORC2 inhibition has the potential to completely eradicate LSC and induce treatment-free remission.
