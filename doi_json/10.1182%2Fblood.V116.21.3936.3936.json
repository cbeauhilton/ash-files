    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3936 Deacetylases (DACs) are enzymes that remove the acetyl groups from target proteins [histones (class I) and non-histone proteins (class II)], leading to regulation of gene transcription and other cellular processes. Panobinostat (LBH589) is a novel and potent DAC class I and II inhibitor undergoing pre-clinical and clinical testing. In order to better characterize the role of DAC inhibitors in the treatment of refractory/resistant B-cell lymphoma., We studied the anti-tumor activity of panobinostat as a single agent or in combination with the proteasome inhibitor (BTZ) against a panel of rituximab-[chemotherapy]-sensitive cell lines (RSCL), rituximab-[chemotherapy]-resistant cell lines (RRCL), and primary lymphoma cells isolated from patients with treatment-nai\u0308ve or refractory/relapsed B-cell lymphoma. In addition, we characterized the mechanisms responsible for panobinostat anti-tumor activity. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cell lines were exposed to escalating doses of panobinostat (0.5-5nM) +/\u2212 BTZ (1-5nM). Changes in mitochondrial potential and ATP synthesis were determined by alamar blue reduction and cell titer glo luminescent assays, respectively. Subsequently, protein lysates were isolated from panobinostat +/\u2212 BTZ exposed cells and changes in members of Bcl-2 family proteins were evaluated by Western blot. Finally, to characterize panobinostat's mechanisms-of-action, lymphoma cells were exposed to panobinostat with or without pan-caspase (Q-VD-OPh, 5mM) or autophagy (3-methyladenine [3MA] 5mM) inhibitors and changes in cell viability were detected as above. Optimal experimental conditions were confirmed by Western blot. Panobinostat exhibited dose-dependent activity as a single agent against RSCL, RRCL and patient-derived primary tumor cells (N=25). In addition, synergistic activity was observed by combining panobinostat with BTZ in vitro . The pharmacological interactions between panobinostat and proteasome inhibitor could be explained in part by the effects each agent has on the expression levels of Bcl-2 family members. In vitro exposure of lymphoma cells to panobinostat resulted in Bcl-XL down-regulation, whereas BTZ exposure causes up-regulation of Bak and Noxa and downregulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL. Caspase inhibition diminished panobinostat anti-tumor activity in RSCL but not in RRCL. On the other hand, exposure of RRCL to 3MA, significantly inhibited the anti-tumor activity of panobinostat in RRCL. Together this data suggest that, panobinostat has a dual mechanism-of-action and can induce cell death by caspase-dependent and -independent pathways. Our data suggests that panobinostat as a single agent is active against rituximab-chemotherapy sensitive and resistant lymphoma cells and potentiates the anti-tumor activity of a proteasome inhibitor (BTZ). A better understanding in the molecular events (caspase-dependent and -independent) triggered by panobinostat in combination with proteasome inhibition is important in order to develop optimal combination strategies using these exciting agents in future clinical trials.
