Objective: To estimate risk of recurrent VTE related to interim hospitalization by conducting a population-based longitudinal review of provider-linked detailed medical records. Methods: We performed a nested case-cohort study. The cohort consisted of all Olmsted County residents with incident VTE 1988\u20132000 and \u22651 day follow-up. Cases were cohort members with recurrent VTE. Subjects were followed for all interim hospitalizations and warfarin use from incident VTE until earliest of emigration, death, recurrent VTE, or 12/31/2005. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards and time dependent covariates to test for the effects of interim hospitalization and prophylaxis on VTE recurrence, adjusting for gender and age at incident VTE. Analyses were limited to subjects who survived free of death and recurrent VTE for \u2265 6 months. Results: Of 1262 incident VTE events (cohort), there were 309 VTE recurrences (cases). We randomly sampled 272 subjects from the cohort and 163 cases. Of the random samples, 210 incident events and 83 cases survived \u2265 6 months free of death and recurrent VTE and form our analysis population. The rate of secondary (interim) prophylaxis was approximately 50% for both incident events and cases, and was not predictive of recurrence (p=0.73). Male gender and interim hospitalization were associated with increased VTE recurrence even after adjusting for age at incident VTE and use of secondary warfarin prophylaxis. The hazard of recurrent VTE was nearly 10-fold higher for subjects with interim hospitalization versus those with none (HR: 9.6; 95% CI: 6.6, 13.8); men had a 1.5-fold increased recurrence rate compared with women (HR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.1). Conclusions: Our results, for the first time, show the importance of interim hospitalization as a predictor of VTE recurrence. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
