    "abstract_text": "The t(4;14) translocation that occurs uniquely in a subset (15%) of multiple myeloma (MM) patients results in the ectopic expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase, Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor3 (FGFR3). Wild-type FGFR3 induces proliferative signals in myeloma cells and appears to be weakly transforming in a hematopoeitic mouse model. The subsequent acquisition of FGFR3 activating mutations in some MM is associated with disease progression and is strongly transforming in several experimental models. The clinical impact of t(4;14) translocations has been demonstrated in several retrospective studies each reporting a marked reduction in overall survival. We have previously shown that inhibition of activated FGFR3 causes morphologic differentiation followed by apoptosis of FGFR3 expressing MM cell lines, validating activated FGFR3 as a therapeutic target in t(4;14) MM and encouraging the clinical development of FGFR3 inhibitors for the treatment of these poor-prognosis patients. CHIR258 is a small molecule kinase inhibitor that targets Class III\u2013V RTKs and inhibits FGFR3 with an IC50 of 5 nM in an in vitro kinase assay. Potent anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activity has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. We employed the IL-6 dependent cell line, B9 that has been engineered to express wild-type FGFR3 or active mutants of FGFR3 (Y373C, K650E, G384D and 807C), to screen CHIR258 for activity against FGFR3. CHIR258 differentially inhibited FGF-mediated growth of B9 expressing wild-type and mutant receptors found in MM, with an IC50 of 25 nM and 80 nM respectively as determined by MTT proliferation assay. Growth of these cells could be rescued by IL-6 demonstrating selectivity of CHIR258 for FGFR3. We then confirmed the activity of CHIR258 against FGFR3 expressing myeloma cells. CHIR258 inhibited the viability of FGFR3 expressing KMS11 (Y373C), KMS18 (G384D) and OPM-2 (K650E) cell lines with an IC50 of 100 nM, 250 nM and 80 nM, respectively. Importantly, inhibition with CHIR258 was still observed in the presence of IL-6, a potent growth factors for MM cells. U266 cells, which lack FGFR3 expression, displayed minimal growth inhibition demonstrating that at effective concentrations, CHIR258 exhibits minimal nonspecific cytotoxicity on MM cells. Further characterization of this finding demonstrated that inhibition of cell growth corresponded to G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and dose-dependent inhibition of downstream ERK phosphorylation. In responsive cell lines, CHIR258 induced apoptosis via caspase 3. In vitro combination analysis of CHIR258 and dexamethasone applied simultaneously to KMS11 cells indicated a synergistic interaction. In vivo studies demonstrated that CHIR258 induced tumor regression and inhibited growth of FGFR3 tumors in a plasmacytoma xenograft mouse model. Finally, CHIR258 produced cytotoxic responses in 4/5 primary myeloma samples derived from patients harboring a t(4;14) translocation. These data indicate that the small molecule inhibitor, CHIR258 potently inhibits FGFR3 and has activity against human MM cells setting the stage for a Phase I clinical trial of this compound in t(4;14) myeloma."
