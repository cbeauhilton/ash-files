    "abstract_text": "Background: We reported that addition of rituximab (R) to chemotherapy significantly improves outcome in DLBCL patients (pt) >60 years ( JCO  24 : 3121 \u201327, 2006 ). Although the IPI is a robust clinical prognostic tool in DLBCL, Sehn et al (ASH 2005: abstract 492) reported that a revised (R) IPI more accurately predicted outcome in pt treated with rituximab-chemotherapy. Methods: We evaluated outcomes of the Intergroup study with respect to the standard IPI, R-IPI, age-adjusted (aa) IPI for evaluable pt treated with R-CHOP alone or with maintenance rituximab. We further assessed a modified IPI (mIPI) using age \u2265 70 y as a cutoff rather than age 60 y. Results: The 267 pt in this analysis were followed for a median of 4 y. Pt characteristics were: age > 70 (48%) (median=69), male 52%, stage III/IV 75%, >1 EN site 30%, LDH elevated 60%, PS \u22652 15%. On univariate analysis all of these characteristics were significant for 3 y failure-free survival (FFS) and overall survival (OS). The IPI provided additional discrimination of risk compared to the R-IPI with significant differences in FFS and OS for 3 vs 4\u20135 factors. The aa-IPI defined relatively few pt as low or high risk. The impact of age was studied using a cut-off of 70 years in a modified IPI, yielding 4 risk groups as shown below. Conclusion s : For pt \u2265 60 treated with rituximab-chemotherapy the distinction between 3 vs 4,5 factors in the IPI was significant.The IPI also provided additional discrimination of risk compared to the R-IPI. In this older group of pt, use of an age cutoff \u226570 y placed more patients in the low risk category. It is of interest to apply the mIPI in other datasets with DLBCL pt >60 y.
