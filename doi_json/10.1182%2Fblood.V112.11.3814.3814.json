    "abstract_text": "Purpose: Symptomatic catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) complicates roughly 5% of central venous catheter insertions in cancer patients. Recent studies have failed to show a reduction in CRT with routine use of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in all patients. We conducted a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data to identify independent, baseline risk factors of CRT that may help to select high-risk patients for prophylaxis. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, DARE, Grey literature databases were searched in all languages from 1995\u20132008. Only prospective studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The primary end-point was objectively confirmed symptomatic and asymptomatic CRT. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of 17 prespecified baseline characteristics was conducted. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Results: A total sample of 5636 subjects from 5 RCTs and 7 prospective studies was included in the analysis. Among these subjects, 425 CRT events were observed (8%). In multivariate logistic regression, the use of implanted ports as compared with peripherally implanted central venous catheters (PICC), decreased CRT risk (OR = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.23\u20130.80). Alternatively, past history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (OR = 2.03; 95% CI, 1.05\u20133.92), subclavian venipuncture insertion technique (OR = 2.16; 95% CI, 1.07\u20134.34), and improper catheter tip location (OR = 1.92; 95% CI, 1.22\u20133.02), increased CRT risk. Conclusions: CRT risk is increased with using PICC catheters, previous history of DVT, subclavian venipuncture insertion technique and improper positioning of the catheter tip. These factors may be useful for risk stratifying patients to select those for thromboprophylaxis. Prospective studies are needed to validate these findings."
