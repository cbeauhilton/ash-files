    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Cord blood transplantation (CBT) represents an alternative source of stem cells for adult patients who lack a matched sibling or unrelated donor. However, the optimal type and intensity of the preparative regimen for patients receiving a CBT is not clear. We hypothesized that a conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine, melphalan and thiotepa will be associated with an acceptable rate of engraftment and treatmentrelated mortality in patients receiving a CBT. METHODS: 37 patients, median age 31 years (2\u201357) and a median weight of 73kg, were treated between 8/2003 and 5/2008. All had advanced hematologic malignancies (24 with acute leukemia, 12 with lymphoma and one with CLL) At the time of transplant, 21 pts (57%) were in complete remission (CR) (first CR=20%) and 16 had relapsed/refractory disease. Grafts consisted of double (29 pts) or single (8 pts) CB units. Cytogenetics for patients with acute leukemia were poor in 11, intermediate in 9, good in 1 and unknown in 3 pts. Donor recipient HLA matching was (intermediate resolution class I HLA A and B and high-resolution DRB1): 3/6 (n=1, 1.5%), 4/6 (n=47, 71.2%) and 5/6 (n=18, 27.3%) alleles (n=66 units). Median total nucleated cell count was 1.8\u00d710 7 /kg (range 1\u20135.8). Nineteen patients received ex-vivo expanded units. The conditioning regimen consisted of melphalan 140 mg/m 2 on day -8, thiotepa 10 mg/m 2 on day -7, fludarabine 160 mg/m 2 over 4 days on days -6, -5, -4, -3, and rabbit ATG 1.25 mg/kg on day -4 and 1.75 mg/kg on day -3 (FMT). Patients with CD 20+ lymphoid malignancies also received rituximab 375mg/m 2 on day -9 (n=8, 22%). GVHD prophylaxis was tacrolimus and mini-methotrexate in 23 (62%) and tacrolimus and mycophenolate in 14 pts (38%). RESULTS: 36 patients (97%) were evaluable for engraftment. 1 patient died within 30 days due to progressive leukemia. 34/36 patients (95%) engrafted neutrophils and had hematopoietic recovery with 100% cord blood-derived cells. At day 30, of the 29 patients who received a double CBT, 75% had chimerism derived entirely from one donor while 25% had mixed donors chimerism. Neutrophil recovery to ANC >0.5 \u00d7 10e9/l occurred after a median of 21 days (range 6\u201345) and platelet recovery to >20 \u00d7 10e9/l after a median of 37 days (range 26\u2013134, N=24; 67%). 32/37 pts (87%) were in CR after transplant with 16 surviving after a median follow-up of 12.1 months. Thirteen patients (36%) developed gr II\u2013IV aGVHD (gr III\u2013IV aGVHD in 5 patients, 14%), and 13 of 32 patients had cGVHD (40%), with the majority experiencing extensive GVHD. 11 patients (29.7%) relapsed after a median of 7 months post transplant and 12 died of nonrelapse causes. Day-100 treatment-related mortality in this heavily pre-treated population was 10%. Overall, causes of death included disease relapse (n=9), infections (n=6), organ failure (n=3), pulmonary hemorrhage (n=1) and GVHD (n=2). CONCLUSIONS: The FMT regimen was sufficiently immunosuppressive to support high rate of engraftment with acceptable TRM in heavily pre-treated adult patients with advanced hematologic malignancies undergoing CBT. These results support further evaluation of this regimen in CBT.",
