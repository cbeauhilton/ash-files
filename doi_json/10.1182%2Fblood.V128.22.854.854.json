    "abstract_text": "Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is associated with a chronic inflammatory state. The inflammasome complex, responsible for IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 cytokine maturation and release, is formed by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as the NLRP3 protein, which recognize damage (or pathogen) associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), in turn recruiting the ASC adapter protein, and cleaving pro-caspase-1, which processes pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 into their bioactive forms. While elevated plasma IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 levels have been reported in SCA, organization of the inflammasome and its components, and the cells in which this occurs, have yet to be identified in the disease. We aimed to determine whether inflammasome assembly occurs in the leukocytes of individuals with SCA, and associate this formation with levels of some circulating inflammatory DAMPs. Leukocytes (separated by ficoll or percoll gradients) and plasma were obtained from healthy control individuals (CON) and SCA patients in steady state (SCA) not on hydroxyurea therapy. Plasma cytokines and DAMPs were quantified by colorimetric/ bioluminescence assays/ ELISA. Caspase-1 activity was determined in phenotypically-characterized leukocyte populations by flow cytometry (Fam-FlicaTM kit). Both IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, hallmarks of inflammasome formation, were significantly increased in SCA plasma, compared to CON (IL-1\u03b2: 0.531\u00b10.221, 0.056\u00b10.026 pg/ml; IL-18: 884.0\u00b1240.7, 304.8\u00b132.4 pg/ml, for SCA [N=13] and CON [N=11], respectively; P0.05). Accordingly, IL-1\u03b2 secretion from SCA monocytes was not significantly augmented (P>0.05). Interestingly, while caspase-1 inhibition (co-incubation with 40 \u00b5M YVAD-FMK) abrogated IL-1\u03b2 release from SCA neutrophils (2x106 cell/ml) during 2 h (decreased from 18.9\u00b11.9 pg/ml to 9.8\u00b11.1 pg/ml; N=5, P0.05). However, no significant correlations were observed between DAMP concentrations and plasma IL-1\u03b2 or neutrophil caspase activity (P>0.05). In conclusion, data indicate that augmented inflammasome assembly occurs in the neutrophils of individuals with SCA; in contrast, we found no evidence of augmented inflammasome activation in the monocytes of these same individuals. Given the high number of neutrophils in the circulation of SCA patients, it seems reasonable to assume that these cells may contribute to augmented IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 processing in this disease. DAMPs, associated with both red cell destruction and ischemia-reperfusion injury, were found elevated in the plasma of the SCA individuals studied and may, collectively, contribute to triggering inflammatory pathways, including inflammasome formation. In conclusion, we present data to confirm that inflammasome assembly occurs in sickle cell anemia and may represent a therapeutic target for SCA.
