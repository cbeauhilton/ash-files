    "abstract_text": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by rapid disease progression. Although the clinical outcome of MCL patients has improved in the recent years, relapses and progressive emergence of resistance to treatment are common. Therefore, alternative therapeutic strategies are in great need for the treatment of MCL patients. Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), the mammalian enzymatic complex plays crucial roles in regulation of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), the catalytic subunit of PRC2 complex is frequently amplified or overexpressed in most solid tumor types. However, EZH2 has been reported to harbor mutations of tyrosine 641 to asparagine (Y641N) in 22% of GCB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and 7% of follicular lymphoma (FL), but not in MCL. In the current study, we sought to elucidate the role of PRC2 in MCL and its implications for epigenetic therapy. We first assessed the expression of PRC2 components EZH2, SUZ12 and EED in several MCL cell lines (Jeko, Mino, Granta, JVM2 and Z138) and normal B-cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that SUZ12 and EED along with EZH2 are overexpressed in proliferating MCL cell lines but not in normal B-cells. Furthermore, aberrant expression of H3 trimethylation (H3K27me3), di-methylation (H3K27me2) and mono-methylation (H3K27me1) was observed in all five MCL cell lines tested as compared to normal B cells. In order to understand if MCL cells have stable and enzymatically active PRC2 methyltransferase complex, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assay using EZH2 antibody and IgG as control. Significant amount of EED and SUZ12 enrichment was observed in the EZH2 immunoprecipitates from Granta and Mino MCL cells. Collectively this data demonstrates that in the MCL cells, PRC2 complex is aberrantly active and is associated with EZH2 upregulation. To study the role of EZH2 and EED in MCL cells, we generated expression constructs of the full-length and deletion fragments EZH2-F (full length EGH2), EZH2-del (EZH2 with deletion of SET domain), EED-F (full length EED) and EED-del (EED with deletion of WD40 domain), respectively. Interestingly, overexpression of EED WT and EZH2 WT led to a significantly (p=0.05) increased cell proliferation resulted in increased H3K27 trimethylation as compared to cells transfected with empty vector. Co-transfection with EZH2-del (SET domain) with the EZH2-F attenuated EZH2-F induced H3K27me3 and cell proliferation, suggesting oncogenic role of EZH2 enzymatic activity. Interestingly, co-transfection of EED-del (deficient in WD40 domain) had no effect on EED-F induced H3K27Me3, and the proliferation was less pronounced as compared with EED-F alone. EZH2 gene inhibition with EZH2-shRNA inhibited the growth of the MCL cells. Pharmacological inhibition of global methyltransferase activity by DZNep or EZH2 specific inhibitor GSK343 greatly suppressed the H3K27me3 level with little effect on H3K27me1 in Granta cells. However, treatment with GSK343 (but not DZNep) inhibited interaction between EZH2 and EED. Furthermore, treatment with EZH2 inhibitor, GSK343, produced significant growth inhibition (more than 90%) at 20uM concentration in Mino, Granta and Z138 cells. Taken together, these results suggest wild-type EZH2 is an epigenetic target for MCL, and MCL cells are highly sensitive to the EZH2 inhibition regardless of EZH2 mutations. Our findings indicate the use of PRC2 and EZH2 epigenetic inhibitors for the treatment of MCL patients. Overall, this study implies that overexpression of wild-type EZH2 has an oncogenic role in MCL, and suggest that wild-type EZH2 may confers similar active PRC2 addiction as mutant-EZH2 does in DLBCLs, FLs and other malignancies.
