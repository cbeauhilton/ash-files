    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Emicizumab is a novel, subcutaneously injectable, recombinant humanized bispecific monoclonal antibody which mimics the function of activated coagulation factor VIII. Due to its mechanism of action and lack of sequence homology, emicizumab is not expected to induce or be affected by anti-factor VIII (FVIII) antibodies (inhibitors). Emicizumab once-weekly dosing has been approved for hemophilia A patients with inhibitors of all ages in several countries. A clinically meaningful prophylactic effect and favorable safety of emicizumab given every 2 weeks (Q2W) and every 4 weeks (Q4W) in adult/adolescent patients has been demonstrate in HAVEN3 study (NCT02847637) and HAVEN4 study (NCT03020160). This is the first report to assess emicizumab prophylaxis in pediatric patients without inhibitors including a patient previously untreated with FVIII. Methods : The present study (JapicCTI-173710) enrolled Japanese patients aged <12 years with hemophilia A without inhibitors. Patients received a loading dose of 3 mg/kg weekly for the first 4 doses, followed by a maintenance dose of 3 mg/kg Q2W or 6 mg/kg Q4W. This interim analysis was performed after at least 6 patients in each dosing cohort had completed at least 12 weeks of treatment with emicizumab prophylaxis. Results : A total of 13 male patients were enrolled in 2 cohorts. The numbers of patients aged 0 - < 2, 2 - < 6, and 6 - < 12 years were 1, 2, and 3 in the Q2W cohort and 2, 2, and 3 in the Q4W cohort. All patients had been previously treated with FVIII prophylaxis except for 1 patient aged 4 months in the Q4W cohort who was previously untreated. As of the data cutoff date of March 14, 2018, the medians (range) of treatment duration were 21 (18.3 - 22.1) and 16 (4.3 - 16.6) weeks in the Q2W and Q4W cohorts, respectively. The interim analysis results showed a clinically meaningful effect of emicizumab prophylaxis with the Q2W and Q4W regimens. As of the data cutoff date, 3/6 patients in the Q2W cohort and 5/7 patients including 1 patient previously untreated with FVIII in the Q4W cohort experienced no treated bleeds. There were no treated spontaneous bleeds and a total of 6 treated bleeds were traumatic. Two out of them were treated joint bleeds. Model-based annualized bleeding rates for treated bleeds with FVIII products under emicizumab prophylaxis were 1.6 (95% CI, 0.60 to 4.25) and 1.0 (95% CI, 0.25 to 4.06) in the Q2W and Q4W cohorts, respectively. All 13 patients experienced at least 1 adverse event (AE) and a total of 78 AEs were reported. There were no AEs that were grade 3 or higher, serious, led to withdrawal from treatment, or resulted in dose modification or interruption. None of the AEs were considered related to emicizumab. Neither thromboembolic events, thrombotic microangiopathy, systemic hypersensitivity reactions, nor local injection site reactions were reported. The most frequent AEs were contusion in 10 (76.9%) patients, excoriation and nasopharyngitis in 4 (30.8%) patients each, and ligament sprain and influenza in 3 (23.1%) patients each. The emicizumab exposures observed in this study were within the observed variability in preceding studies. No effects of age or body weight on emicizumab exposure were evident. Conclusions : This interim analysis results suggested clinically meaningful efficacy and favorable safety of the emicizumab Q2W and Q4W regimens in patients aged <12 years with severe hemophilia A without inhibitors. This suggests that it should be appropriate to apply the same dosing regimens of emicizumab for pediatric patients without inhibitors and other patient populations of hemophilia A. The updated results of primary analysis after completing at least 24 weeks on emicizumab treatment will be presented at the meeting.
