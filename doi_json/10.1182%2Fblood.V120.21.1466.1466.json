    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1466 Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy. Although cure rates for this disease are approximately 90%, ALL remains one of the leading causes cancer-related deaths in children. Thus, new treatments are needed for those patients that do not respond to or recur following standard chemotherapy. Understanding the mechanisms underlying resistance of pediatric ALL to therapy offers one approach to improving outcomes. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of communication between cancer cells and their microenvironment and how this contributes to the progression and therapeutic resistance but this has not been well studied in the context of ALL. Since the bone marrow is presumed to be the site of initiation of B precursor ALL we set out in our study to determine how ALL cells utilize the bone marrow milieu in a syngeneic transplantable model of preB cell ALL in immunocompetent mice. In this model, intravenously injected preB ALL develops first in the bone marrow, followed by infiltration into the spleen, lymph node, and liver. Using flow cytometry to detect the CD45.2 isoform following injection into B6CD45.1+ congenic recipients, leukemic cells can be identified in the bone marrow as early as 5 days after IV injection with a sensitivity of 0.01%-0.1%. The pre-B ALL line is B220+/CD19+/CD43+/BP1+/IL-7Ralpha (CD127)+/CD25-/Surface IgM-/cytoplasmic IgM+ consistent with a pre-pro B cell phenotype. We find that increasing amounts of leukemic infiltration in the bone marrow leads to an accumulation of non-malignant developing B cells at stages immediately prior to the pre-pro B cell (CD43+BP1-CD25-) and a reduction in non-malignant developing pre B cells at the developmental stage just after to the pre-pro B cell stage (CD43+BP1+CD25+). These data potentially suggest occupancy of normal B cell developmental niches by leukemia resulting in block in normal B cell development. Further supporting this hypothesis, we find significant reduction in early progression of ALL in aged (10\u201312 month old) mice known to have a deficiency in B cell developmental niches. We next explored whether specific factors that support normal B cell development can contribute to progression of precursor B cell leukemia. The normal B cell niche has only recently been characterized and the specific contribution of this niche to early ALL progression has not been extensively studied. Using a candidate approach, we examined the role of specific cytokines such as Interleukin-7 (IL-7) and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in early ALL progression. Our preB ALL line expresses high levels of IL-7Ralpha and low but detectable levels of TLSPR. In the presence of IL-7 (0.1 ng/ml) and TSLP (50 ng/ml) phosphSTAT5 is detectable indicating that these receptors are functional but that supraphysiologic levels of TSLP are required. Consistent with the importance of IL-7 in leukemia progression, preliminary data demonstrates reduced lethality of pr-B cell ALL in IL-7 deficient mice. Overexpression of TSLP receptor (TSLPR) has been associated with high rates of relapse and poor overall survival in precursor B cell ALL. We are currently generating a TSLPR overepressing preBALL line to determine the effect on early ALL progression and are using GFP-expressing preB ALL cells to identify the initial location of preB ALL occupancy in the bone marrow. In conclusion, or model of early ALL progression provides insight into the role of the bone marrow microenvironment in early ALL progression and provides an opportunity to examine how these microenvironmental factors contribute to therapeutic resistance. Given recent advances in immunotherapy for hematologic malignancies, the ability to study this in an immunocompetent host will be critical.
