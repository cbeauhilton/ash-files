    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1550 Background: Clofarabine is a second generation nucleoside analogue with activity in adults with AML. A recent randomized phase III study in AML relapse showed higher response rates and better event-free survival with the combination of clofarabine and cytarabine (CA) compared to cytarabine alone. We have also reported the feasibility and safety of the addition of idarubicin to CA (CIA) in a previous phase I and II study. To explore this combination further, we conducted a phase II study of CIA in pts</= 60 years with previously untreated AML. Patients and Methods: Patients (Pts) were eligible if they were  2, cardiac ejection fraction < 45%, or active and uncontrolled infection. For the first 30 pts, induction therapy consisted of Clofarabine 22.5 mg/m 2 iv daily (days 1\u20135), Idarubicin 6 mg/m 2 daily (days 1\u20133), and Cytarabine 0.75 g/m 2 daily (days 1\u20135). From pt 31 onward, induction doses were amended to Clofarabine 20 mg/m 2 \u00d7 5, Idarubicin 10 mg/m 2 \u00d7 3, and Cytarabine 1 g/m 2 \u00d7 5. Pts who have not achieved a complete remission following the induction could receive one re-induction course. Pts in CR or CRp continued with up to 6 consolidation cycles with Clofarabine 22.5 mg/m 2 \u00d7 3, Idarubicin 6 mg/m 2 (days 1\u20132), and Cytarabine 0.75 g/m 2 \u00d7 3, subsequently amended to Clofarabine 15 mg/m 2 \u00d7 3, Idarubicin 8 mg/m 2 \u00d7 2, and Cytarabine 0.75 g/m 2 \u00d7 3. Supportive care was standard. Pts \u2265 50 yrs were admitted to a laminar air flow room for the duration of the induction. Results: From April 2010 until August 2011, 51 pts have been accrued with a median age of 49 yrs (range 19\u201359): 33 pts (65%) with de novo AML and 18 pts (35%) with secondary AML (18 related to MDS, 7 related to therapy). Three pts (5%) had a PS of 2. Median WBC at diagnosis was 3.4 \u00d7 10 9 /L (0.6-92.3). Thirty-three (65%) pts had abnormal cytogenetics (21/33[64%] poor risk and 5/33 [15%] intermediate risk). Molecular profile: 6 pts (11%) had FLT3/ITD, 3 pts (6%) CEBPA, and 8 pts (16%) NPM1 mutations. Thirty-five pts (69%) achieved CR and 1 (2%) CRp for an overall response rate (ORR) of 71%. 61% pts (31/51) achieved CR following one induction cycle. 18% (9/51) pts required a re-induction and 44% (4/9) of them responded after the re-induction. Responding pts received a median of 2 courses (1\u20138) courses. With a median follow-up of 23 weeks (3\u201336+) median remission duration has not been reached with a 1-yr remission probability of 85%. Ten pts (19%) died on study including 2 (4%) who died < 28 days from treatment start (one from septic shock and multi-organ failure, and one from Steven Johnson syndrome). Median overall survival (OS) for responding pts has not been reached (2\u201336 weeks). One-yr survival probability is 65%. Sixteen pts (31%) proceeded with an allogenic stem cell transplant in CR1. Most toxicities were  grade 2 included elevated bilirubin (4%), hypokalemia (4%), cellulitis (4%) and seizure (1%). Myelosuppression was ubiquitous but prolonged myelosuppression > 42 days was infrequent. 76 % (39/51) pts had neutropenic fever. Conclusion: Clofarabine, Idarubicin and Cytarabine achieve a response rate of 71% in patients </=60 yrs with previously untreated AML. Induction mortality was low and the toxicity profile was expected and manageable. Longer follow up and comparisons with standard induction therapy will be needed to further assess the role of this combination in AML therapy.
