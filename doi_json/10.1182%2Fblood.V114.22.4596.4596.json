    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4596 Normal platelet production is dependent on the formation of branched long cytoplasmic extensions, called proplatelets (PPT). Mutations of the Myh9 gene (encoding for the nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA) result in autosomal dominant disorders, where patients develop various degrees of macrothrombocytopenia, with sometimes glomerular impairment, hearing loss and cataracts. There has been questioning as to whether the mechanism for the macrothrombocytopenia is haploinsufficiency, or a dominant negative effect of the mutated gene. We performed an in vitro study to investigate PPF from patient megakaryocytes (MK). By this approach, a decrease in PPF from patient CD34 derived MKs was observed in comparison to normal cultured MK. Surprisingly this defect of PPF observed in patients was rescued by blebbistatin, an inhibitor of class II myosin. Immunofluorescence studies performed showed that besides clusterization of GPIb in patient's platelets, no major repartition abnormalities were seen in cultured MKs derived from patient's CD34 for myosin, actin, tubulin, vWF, and Rac (except in one patient where actin and Rac formed aggregates to some extend, in a small number of MKs). In order to better understand the role of myosin during normal and abnormal PPF, we used a shRNA strategy to disrupt the Myh9 expression during normal MK differentiation and compared shRNA-treated MKs with MKs derived from patient CD34. Megakaryocytes treated with a shRNA that knocks down the protein of about 50%, did not alter MK ploidization, but decreased in vitro PPF, as previously observed for cells issued from patients. Moreover, shRNA-treated MKs exhibited the same ultrastructural abnormalities as patient MKs. Addition of Blebbistatin to shRNA treated MKs led to an increase of PPF, suggesting that the remaining myosin II might be hyperactivated and inhibit PPF. Altogether this study strongly suggests that the thrombocytopenia of the Myh9 syndrome is essentially related to haploinsufficiency in myosin II.
