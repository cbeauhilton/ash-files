    "abstract_text": "Objective: To inquire into the clinical features of acquired multiple coagulation factors inhibitors associated bleeding disorder. Methods: A case of acquired multiple coagulation factors inhibitors in clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment and result was described and related literatures were reviewed. Results : A 74-year-old man developed sustained wound bleeding after implantation of heart pacemaker. Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were prolonged significantly. But thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen (Fg), platelet count(PLT) and liver function were normal. 3P test was negative. Further tests revealed that the activities of factor 2, 5, 7,8,9,10,11,12 were all less than 10%, and the inhibitors of these factors could be detected, with the titers ranging from 8~64 Bu. So acquired multiple coagulation factor inhibitors was diagnosed. Transfusion with frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate was ineffective, whereas the combination therapy with glucocorticoid plus plasma exchange seemed to be successful. The patient was cured. Conclusion: Acquired multiple coagulation factors inhibitors is a rare bleeding disorder. In fact, this is the first case, as far as we are aware. It may develop serious bleeding. Immunosuppressive agents, such as corticosteroids, used for suppression of autoantibodies formation and plasma exchange, used for eradication of inhibitors may have beneficial effects.",
