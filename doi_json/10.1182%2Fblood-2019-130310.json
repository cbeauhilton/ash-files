    "abstract_text": "Background: Myelofibrosis (MF) is a life-threatening disease characterized by splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, and shortened survival. Although ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, is approved for Intermediate or High-risk MF and can reduce the spleen size and improve quality of life, many patients discontinue due to loss of efficacy. In preclinical models, the activity of mutated JAK2 is tightly regulated by epichaperomes, a complex network of proteins which forms under cellular stress, such as cancer, and nucleates on heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), which in turn assumes a specific conformation in its ATP binding domain. PU-H71 is a first-in-class inhibitor of tumor epichaperome-specific Hsp90, which potently kills cancer cells via disruption of the epichaperome and degradation of JAK2 as well as other client proteins. Prior dose-ranging studies of PU-H71 administered intravenously to patients with cancer identified a safe and tolerable dose. In this study, we assess an oral formulation of PU-H71 and evaluate the hypothesis that its cancer-specific mechanism combined with ruxolitinib may result in added clinical benefit as well as a wider therapeutic window. Methods: This is a multicenter, Phase 1b study with dose escalation and expansion cohorts designed to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of PU-H71 in patients with PMF, Post-PV MF, Post ET MF. Up to 24 patients who have active disease and receiving \u22653 months of ruxolitinib therapy (and on a stable dose for 8 weeks before starting therapy with PU-H71) will be enrolled. Evidence of persistent or worsening disease consisting of disease-related symptoms and splenomegaly of at least 5 cm below the costal margin as measured by physical examination are required. Additional inclusion criteria include a baseline platelet count of \u226550,000/mL and AST/ALT \u22642 x Upper Limit of Normal. Patients with a QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) >480 ms (corrected) or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u226450% are excluded. The study will employ a standard 3+3 dose escalation design beginning with 50 mg/day to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), with additional patients treated in a dose expansion cohort. Response to treatment will be assessed by the 2013 revised International Working Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Research and Treatment and European Leukemia Net. Additional assessments will include symptom burden assessment using the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form Total Symptom Score, bone marrow histology, JAK2V617F allele burden, serum cytokine profiles, flow cytometry of peripheral blood mononuclear cells for epichaperome status, and pharmacokinetic studies. Enrollment is ongoing. Clinical trial information: NCT03935555.
