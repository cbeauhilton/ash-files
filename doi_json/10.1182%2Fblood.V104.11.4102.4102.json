    "abstract_text": "Background: The incidence and distribution of unexpected antibody screening test has been evaluated with Caucasian RBC panel cell. In spite of high incidence of Di a and Mi a antigen phenotype in Korea-Mongoloid and south-east population respectively, there has been no documented research on the incidence of anti-Di a and anti-Mi a in Korea particularly. To investigate the frequencies and clinical significance of unexpected antibody, screening test including Di a and Mi a panel cell was performed. Method: We analyzed the result from 17,664 antibody screening tests performed during recent 30 month period (March 2001\u2013Sep 2003). Antibody screening and identification test are performed using Liss/Coombs gel test with DiaMed-ID system (DiaMed AG, Cressier, Morat, Switzerland) including Di a and Mi a panel cell. The incidence of Di a and Mi a phenotype was simultaneously evaluated. Results : The incidence of unexpected antibodies was 1.2% (214/17,664). Antibodies that were detected most frequently were anti-Rh (74 patient), followed by anti-Lewis (21 patient) and anti-Di a (15 patients). Out of 6345 patients, 3 anti-Mi a (0.047%) were detected. Antibodies of Di a and Mi a were IgG specificity and anti-Di a was immune antibody, anti-Mi a was mixed with immune and natural antibodies. The frequencies of Di a and Mi a phenotye were 12.2% and 0.93% respectively. Conclusion : This study shows that anti-Di a and Mi a antibodies are detected frequently for Korean. For safer transfusions, therefore, Di a and Mi a panel cell should be also included in antibody screening test for Korean.",
