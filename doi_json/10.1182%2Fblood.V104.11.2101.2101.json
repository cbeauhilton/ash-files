    "abstract_text": "We have recently demonstrated that co-expression of HOXB4 enables the enhanced delivery of HSC harbouring a second therapeutic trans-gene. Nonetheless, it is of great importance to elaborate the current knowledge about the mechanism of HOXB4 action in order to both evaluate the safety implications of its use in a clinical strategy, and to gain greater insight into the regulation of HSC self-renewal/expansion. To these ends we have performed an extensive in vitro analysis of the consequences of HOXB4 overexpression in primary murine BMC and in a murine multipotent myeloid progenitor cell line (FDCP-mix). We demonstrate for the first time in murine cells, that ectopic HOXB4 reduces the responsiveness of murine hematopoietic cells to differentiation stimuli. Furthermore, by performing a detailed investigation into the kinetics of FDCP-mix differentiation, we reveal that HOXB4 overexpression results in a specific differentiation delay as opposed to an outright block. We propose that an analogous delay is in operation in repopulating cells in order that the shift to increased assymetrical self-renewal, a requirement for stem cell expansion, is achieved. Notwithstanding this, it is clear that any perturbation in differentiation constitutes an increased risk of cellular transformation if this technology were transferred to a clinical setting. In order to further define the repercussions of ectopic HOXB4 delivery, we have developed a retroviral vector which encodes an activatable version of HOXB4. We have shown that this vector is able to mediate an in vitro differentiation delay in primary murine BMC and FDCP-mix as well as enable enhanced engraftment of BMC in vivo , both dependent upon the addition of the estrogen analogue; tamoxifen. Using this system, we are currently examining the effect of ectopic HOXB4 on the transcriptome of FDCP-mix cells, in addition to performing an in depth study into the biological mechanisms affected by HOXB4 overexpression in BMC in vivo . We envisage that these model systems will be particularly amenable to the manipulation required for target gene identification/validation.",
