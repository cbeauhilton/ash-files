    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: The FLIPI score has been shown to predict survival in FL pts. Previous studies have suggested that type of treatment, and quality of response may not affect survival in pts with stage IV IFL. We address here the significance of TTF and quality of response as prognostic factors for survival in stage IV IFL. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 580 pts with stage IV IFL treated from 1972- to 2002 with anthracycline containing regimens +/\u2212 rituximab. Demographics: male 51%, age 60 28%, Hgb<12 17%, high LDH 23%, 5 or more nodal groups 66%, BM+ 93%, FLIPI 3 or more 76%. RESULTS: With a median f/up of 7 years  Response . <PR (n=17) . PR (n=86) . CR (n=477) . % dead 88 74 34 Median OS (mos) 19* 56* 185* TTF <1yr (n=60) 1\u20132yr (n=88) >2yr (n=432) % dead 85 53 33 Median OS (mos) 25* 76* 191* *p=0.001  % ORR (% CR) TTF (mos) Median OS (yrs) FLIPI<3 (n=151) 98 (89) 84 20.5 FLIPI\u22653 (n=429) 96 (80) 44 10 Response . <PR (n=17) . PR (n=86) . CR (n=477) . % dead 88 74 34 Median OS (mos) 19* 56* 185* TTF <1yr (n=60) 1\u20132yr (n=88) >2yr (n=432) % dead 85 53 33 Median OS (mos) 25* 76* 191* *p=0.001  % ORR (% CR) TTF (mos) Median OS (yrs) FLIPI<3 (n=151) 98 (89) 84 20.5 FLIPI\u22653 (n=429) 96 (80) 44 10 View Large Regression analysis for survival showed that both TTF and FLIPI correlated well with survival and were independent of each other (p<0.00001). CONCLUSION: As expected, FLIPI <3 correlated with longer survival in IFL treated with anthracycline containing regimens. Interestingly, achievement of CR, longer response duration as measured by TTF also correlated with longer survival."
