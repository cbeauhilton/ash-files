    "abstract_text": "In a process termed \u201chop diffusion\u201d, membrane proteins diffuse randomly within a cytoskeletally-enclosed compartment over short time scales, periodically hopping from one compartment to the next. Band 3 diffuses in the erythrocyte membrane bilayer in a manner that is thought to be restricted by the size and stability of the spectrin network. Although a fraction of band 3 may exhibit reduced mobility due to its association with spectrin (mediated by proteins such as ankyrin and adducin), another subpopulation of band 3 is thought to diffuse freely within the spectrin compartments, hopping from one corral to the next by transient opening of the barrier (presumably a spectrin tetramer) separating adjacent corrals. Based on this hypothesis, measurement of the compartment size and hopping frequency of a band 3 molecule in the erythrocyte membrane can provide information on the structure and stability of the spectrin network. We have combined single particle tracking (SPT) techniques with high-speed video microscopy to determine the average compartment size and diffusion coefficient of the mobile fraction of band 3 in both normal and diseased red blood cells (RBCs). Streptavidin-linked quantum dots (525nm emission) and 40 nm fluorescent beads were attached to band 3 via a DIDS-biotin-linker, and fluorescence microscopy coupled to a high speed camera was used to determine the position of band 3 with a time resolution of 8 ms (120 fps). Labeling specificity was demonstrated by blotting with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase, and flow cytometry studies established the binding constant of DIDS-biotin for band 3 in the intact cell of \u223c1-2*10 \u22125 M. For diffusion studies, RBCs were incubated with 10 \u221211 M conjugate in order to attach only one or two streptavidin-quantum dots per cell. SPT data were collected on both healthy and pathologic human RBCs, including HbSS (sickle cells), HbSC (sickle cell hemoglobin C), HbSB o (sickle cell zero-beta-thalasamia), HbSB + (sickle cell beta-plus-thalasamia), HS (hereditary spherocytosis), and HPP (hereditary pyropoikilocytosis). Movement within the observed compartments was found to be random, with an average diagonal length for the mobile fraction in healthy cells of \u223c100nm and a diffusion coefficient of \u223c1\u20132*10 \u221210 cm 2 /s . HbSS cells, however, displayed a comparatively smaller compartment size (\u223c60\u201380nm) with a lower diffusion coefficient (0.1\u22121*10 \u221210 cm 2 /s). In contrast, HPP cells exhibited an average compartment size of \u223c133nm with a diffusion coefficient of 6*10 \u221210 cm 2 /s. SPT data further suggest the presence of multiple populations of band 3, exhibiting both free diffusion and restricted mobilities with different characteristics. Details of band 3 diffusion in all of the aforementioned diseased and normal blood cells will be provided, and a model accounting for the multiple populations of band 3 will be presented.",
