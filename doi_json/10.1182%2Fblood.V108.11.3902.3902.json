    "abstract_text": "This study was aimed to investigate functions of glycosylation cooled rabbit platelets in vivo and in vitro and the method to store cold platelets with UDP-gal. We collected rabbit heart blood, prepared concentrated platelet suspensions in a normal way to which we added UDP-Gal, and then stored them for ten days in 4\u00b0 refrigerator. Thereafter platelet counts, mean platelet volume, platelet distributing width, platelet aggregation function, the activity to urge coagulation including PF3aT and APCT and apoptosis were determine- d. Meanwhile, survival time in vivo was tested after cold-stored rabbit platelets labeled with Cr 51 were transfused into rabbits. Rabbit ear bleeding time and percentage plate recovery(PPR) were determined 1 hour and 24 hour after they were transfused into rabbit thrombocytopenia model. Results show that there was not significant difference in PLT counts, MPV, PDW, PF3aT and APCT between UDP-Gal cold-stored platelet group and fresh platelet group(p>0.05). On the contrary, platelet counts decreased significantly, MPV, PDW jumped and PF3aT and APCT went down in cold control group compared to fresh platelet group(p0.05). PPR was 66.1%\u00b10.5%,47.8%\u00b10.6%;60.9%\u00b10.3%,41.6%\u00b10.4%;47.7%\u00b10.5%,9.4%\u00b10.5% respectively in fresh platelet group, UDP-Gal cold-stored platelet group and cold control group. PPR after transfusion of galactosylation cooled rabbit platelet had no statistical difference compared with that of fresh platelet group(p>0.05), and they in both groups were much higher than that in cold control group(p<0.01). Conclusion: Galactosylation can improve functions of cooled rabbit platelets in vivo and in vitro. and prolong the storage time of them.",
