    "abstract_text": "Background Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized peripheral blood stem cell has been used more frequently than bone marrow as the source of stem cells in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Although it contains more mature T cells, neither the incidence nor the severity of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is higher compared with bone marrow transplantation. This might be due to the immunoregulatory effects of G-CSF on T cells, including that G-CSF directly modulated via its receptor on T cells or indirectly modulated T cell immune responses via effector cells and cytokines. Recent studies have shown that \u03b3\u03b4 + T cells have immunoregulatory function, and might also participate in the pathogenesis of GVHD. However, these mechanisms are not fully understood, and whether G-CSF could influence the immunoregulatory-associated gene expression of \u03b3\u03b4 + T cells remains unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of G-CSF mobilization on the expression of immunoregulatory-associated molecules and G-CSFR gene in the peripheral blood \u03b3\u03b4 + T cells. Methods Peripheral blood \u03b3\u03b4 + T cells were sorted by magnetic activated cell-sorting system. The expression levels of immunoregulatory- associated molecules (Foxp3, CD25, CTLA-4, GITR, TLR8, STAT-1, STAT-3 and RORc) and G-CSFR gene were analyzed in peripheral blood \u03b3\u03b4 + T cells from 10 donors before and after G-CSF mobilization, using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with SYBR Green I staining. The \u03b2 2 -microglobulin gene was used as an endogenous reference, and the relative mRNA expression level of each gene was evaluated by the 2 -\u0394Ct \u00d7100% method. Results The expression levels of Foxp3, CD25, CTLA-4 and GITR genes in peripheral blood \u03b3\u03b4 + T cells were similar before and after G-CSF mobilization ( P =0.827, P =0.667, P =0.053 and P =0.129). The expression level of TLR8 gene in peripheral blood \u03b3\u03b4 + T cells after G-CSF mobilization (0.731% \u00b1 0.350%) was significantly higher than that before mobilization (0.188% \u00b1 0.176%) ( P =0.001). The expression level of STAT-1 gene in peripheral blood \u03b3\u03b4 + T cells did not differ significantly before and after G-CSF mobilization ( P =1.000), while the expression levels of STAT-3, RORc and G-CSFR genes in peripheral blood \u03b3\u03b4 + T cells after mobilization (0.536% \u00b1 0.234%, 0.683% \u00b1 0.250%, 8.208% \u00b1 6.175%) were significantly higher than that before mobilization (0.243% \u00b1 0.134%, 0.356% \u00b1 0.179%, 1.947% \u00b1 1.442%) ( P =0.003, P =0.003 and P =0.007). Conclusions G-CSF mobilization might increase the expression levels of TLR8, STAT-3, RORc and G-CSFR genes in peripheral blood \u03b3\u03b4 + T cells. The result suggested that G-CSF might play the role of immunoregulation by affecting \u03b3\u03b4 + T cells.
