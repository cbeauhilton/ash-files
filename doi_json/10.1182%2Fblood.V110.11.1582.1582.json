    "abstract_text": "Background: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an incurable non-Hodgkin lymphoma. MCL is characterized by the chromosomal translocation t(11;14) leading to overexpression of cyclin D1 (CCND1), a regulator of the cell cycle. NF-\u03baB plays a central role in key cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, and it has been shown to be constitutively activated in MCL cell lines and in patient biopsy samples and to play a key role in the growth and survival of MCL cells. In an exploratory study, we evaluated the hypothesis that germline variation in candidate genes from the cell cycle and NF-\u03baB pathways predict overall survival in MCL. Methods: We genotyped 235 SNPs from 29 cell cycle genes and 447 SNPs from 55 NF-\u03baB genes in 39 MCL patients aged 38\u201364 years who participated in a population-based study conducted from 1998\u20132000 through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registries in Detroit, Seattle, Iowa, and Los Angeles county. Tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected from HapMap. Stage, presence of B-symptoms, first course of therapy, date of last follow-up, and vital status were derived from linkage to registry databases at each study site. To assess the statistical significance of a gene, we first used principal components analysis to capture the genetic variation of the SNPs within a gene. Cox proportional hazards analysis was then used to assess the association between the top principal components from a gene with overall survival. Results: Through early 2005, there were 22 deaths in 39 patients (56%). The median follow-up of the 17 surviving patients was 56 months (range 36\u201370). Eleven of the 55 genes ( TNFSF14 p=0.0007, NF- \u03ba BIA p=0.003, IL1R2 p=0.01, TNFRSF25 p=0.02, TNFSF13B p=0.02, FAS p=0.03, TLR2 p=0.04, TNFSF10D p=0.04, TNFSF10 p=0.06, MAP3K2 p=0.06) in the NF-\u03baB pathway were associated with overall survival. In the cell cycle pathway, only 3 of the 29 genes ( CASP5 p=0.06, CASP9 p=0.09, BCL2 p=0.09) were associated with overall survival, and a previously reported SNP in CCND1 ( rs603965 ) showed no association (p=0.5). Permutation p-values for observing at least this number of associated tests in each pathway due to chance (from multiple testing) was p=0.8 for the cell cycle pathway and p=0.03 for NF-\u03baB pathway. The small sample size precluded multi-gene modeling. Conclusion: In a population series of MCL patients, we found suggestive evidence that host genetic variation in candidate NF-\u03baB pathway genes affects overall survival. These results complement tumor expression data implicating this pathway in the pathogenesis of MCL. In addition, such findings further support the value of developing therapeutic targets from this pathway."
