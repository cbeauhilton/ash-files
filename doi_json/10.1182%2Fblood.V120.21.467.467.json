    "abstract_text": "Abstract 467 Background: While donor-recipient disparity at HLA loci is associated with greater risk for severe acute graft vs. host disease (GVHD) and inferior survival after unrelated donor allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), the impact of amino acid substitution (AAS) at peptide binding pockets of the HLA molecule is incompletely understood. Methods: Adult and pediatric patients who received myeloablative or reduced intensity/non-myeloablative first unrelated bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for AML, ALL, CML or MDS between 1988 and 2009 were included. Donors and patients were fully high resolution matched for HLA-A, B, C, and DRB1 (8/8) or had single mismatch (7/8) at one HLA class I locus. Among 7/8 donor-recipient pairs, cases were categorized based on the presence or absence of the AAS of interest at positions 9, 77, 99, 116, or 156 of the class I molecule. In multivariable analysis accounting for patient, disease, and transplantation variables, we studied the independent impact of AAS at these residues on risk for grade III-IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, treatment-related mortality, primary malignancy relapse, and overall survival. We compared 7/8 donor-recipient pairs with AAS of interest to 7/8 pairs without these AAS in the primary analyses. Additionally, we performed this analysis restricted to each HLA class I locus. Results: Donor-recipient pairs were 8/8 matched (n=5282), 7/8 with AAS of interest (n=1713), or 7/8 without AAS of interest (n=318). In multivariable analysis, AAS at position 116 was associated with increased risk for grade III-IV acute GVHD (HR 1.21, 1.04\u20131.42, p=0.0165). No other significant association was detected between AAS studied and clinical outcomes. In multivariable analysis restricted to each class I HLA locus, we detected the following: Among 7/8 matched pairs with mismatch at HLA-C, AAS at position 116 was associated with increased risk for severe acute GVHD (HR 1.42, 1.13\u20131.79, p=0.0031) and inferior OS (HR 1.2, 1.01\u20131.41, p=0.0343). AAS at position 99 was associated with increased TRM (HR 1.37, 1.11\u20131.69, p=0.0037). Of 7/8 pairs with mismatch at HLA-B, AAS at position 9 was associated with increased chronic GVHD (HR 2.19, 1.31\u20133.66, p=0.0029). Specific amino acid substitution pairs with frequency > 30 were tested for association with HCT outcomes. None met the significance level of 0.00125, pre-specified for multiple comparisons. Conclusions: These results support the concept that AAS at key peptide-binding residues in the HLA class I molecule are associated with increased risk for severe acute GVHD and lower survival.
