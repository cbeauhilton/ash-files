    "abstract_text": "Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked hematopoietic disorder that is characterized by immune deficiency, eczema and severe thrombocytopenia with small platelets. Platelets isolated from WAS patients are cleared rapidly from the circulation when transfused autologously. However, the role of WASp, the protein mutated or absent in WAS, is unclear since platelets isolated from WAS patients function normally. WASp knockout (KO) mice only have a mild thrombocytopenia. Because 1) human, but not mouse platelets express the Fc receptor for IgGs, Fc\u03b3RIIA (CD32A), and 2) platelet-associated IgGs (PAIgGs) are often observed in WAS patients, we sought to determine whether Fc\u03b3RIIA expression in humans was involved in the severe thrombocytopenia associated with WAS. WASp KO mice expressing human Fc\u03b3RIIA on the surface of their platelets were generated by breeding female mice carriers for WASp deficiency with heterozygous Fc\u03b3RIIA transgenic (TG) males. A total of 221 offsprings were obtained, of which only 97 were males. WASp KO / Fc\u03b3RIIA TG males were a minority, with a total of 19 animals, compared to 24 WASp WT / Fc\u03b3RIIA WT, 30 WASp WT / Fc\u03b3RIIA TG and 24 WASp KO / Fc\u03b3RIIA WT males. WASp KO / Fc\u03b3RIIA WT and WASp KO / Fc\u03b3RIIA TG males had about 70% of normal platelet count compared to WASp WT / Fc\u03b3RIIA WT and WASp WT / Fc\u03b3RIIA TG mice (Table 1). Thus, Fc\u03b3RIIA expression did not affect the thrombocytopenia associated with WASp deficiency. PAIgGs were not detected on the surface of WASp KO / Fc\u03b3RIIA TG platelets, as evaluated by flow cytometry using an anti-mouse IgG antibody. Spleen weight was increased in WASp KO / Fc\u03b3RIIA TG compared to WASp WT / Fc\u03b3RIIA WT and WASp WT / Fc\u03b3RIIA TG males, but similar to that of WASp KO / Fc\u03b3RIIA WT males (Table 1). Age of the mice was not involved since similar results were obtained with 6-, 12- or 24-weeks old mice. However, an increased population of macrophages appeared in the spleen of mice lacking WASp as they aged, as evidenced by flow cytometry using anti-mouse Mac-1 (CD11b) and Gr-1 (Ly-6G) antibodies. Our data indicate that expression of platelet Fc\u03b3RIIA alone does not explain the difference observed between the severe thrombocytopenia of WAS patients and the mild thrombocytopenia of WASp KO mice. WASp deficiency may affect the surface organization of platelets such that clearance is accelerated by spleen macrophages. Table 1.
