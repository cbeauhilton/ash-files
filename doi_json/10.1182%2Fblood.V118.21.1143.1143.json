The polymorphism of the \u03b23 gene of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 results in an amino acid exchange with a leucin (HPA-1a) or a prolin (HPA-1b) at residue 33. We have shown in patients with coronary artery disease that the HPA-1b variant of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is associated with premature manifestation of acute myocardial infarction (MI) (JTH 2005). Autopsy studies have confirmed that HPA-1b is strongly associated with coronary thrombi after MI. Recently, we have documented that HPA-1b platelets display increased adhesion, increased thrombus stability, and increased outside-in signaling corresponding to their prothrombotic character. To explore the nature of this phenotype in further detail, we have now generated a model overexpressing fluorescent proteins fused with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in transfected cells to assess the postulated differences between both HPA-1 isoforms with regard to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation and its concomitant conformational changes. Materials and Methods: Transfected and fluorescently tagged HEK293 cells stably expressing either HPA-1a or HPA-1b of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 were generated. The cyan (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) were cloned to the C-termini of the \u03b23 and \u03b1IIb subunits prior to cell transfection. To explore conformational changes in the cytoplasmic tails and the activation of integrin, dynamic measurements were performed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) under static and dynamic conditions (shear rates of 100 to 1600 s \u22121 ) using an established flow model. Results: Functional integrity of both integrin variants and correct membrane insertion were examined by flow cytometry and documented intact activation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in the transfected cells upon phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced (PMA)-induced stimulation of protein kinase C and specific binding of alexa647 fibrinogen (Fg) to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 upon inside-out activation. In the presence of abciximab, binding of alexa647 Fg to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 was completely blocked in both isoforms (PMA, mean: 119 units vs. abciximab 10 units). Upon cell adhesion under static condition and subsequent outside-in signaling, the HPA-1b isoform displayed a quantitatively different activation pattern than HPA-1a, as detected by FRET analyses. Thus, FRET signals, defined by the ratio of acceptor to donor fluoresecence intensity, revealed a faster and more distinct decrease in HPA-b (67+5) than in HPA-1a (75+6) (HPA-1b vs. HPA-1a, p=0.0053). This finding corresponds to are more pronounced spatial separation of the cytoplasmic tails in the HPA-1b variant of \u03b1IIb\u03b23. By contrast, stimulation with PMA (1 \u03bcM) caused an opposite effect in HPA-1a transfectants, as compared to HPA-1b (p<0.001), indicative of a distinct property upon inside-out activation. Upon interaction of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 with immobilized fibrinogen to induce outside-in signaling, HPA-1b exhibited an increased activation of the phosphotyrosine motif at residue Y418 (pY418) of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23-associated Src kinase, as compared with HPA-1a (p<0.05). No such difference was observed in Src phosphorylation upon stimulation with PMA (inside-out signaling). These findings suggest that the HPA-1 polymorphism of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 can modulate indeed outside-in signaling upon interaction of the transfectants with immobilized fibrinogen. When \u03b1IIb\u03b23-transfected HEK293 cells adherent onto immobilized fibrinogen were exposed to increasing arterial shear rates (800 to 1600 s \u22121 ), FRET analyses and digital imaging confirmed a more pronounced spatial separation of the cytoplasmic tails (\u03b1IIb-CFP; \u03b23-YFP) in HPA-1b than in HPA-1a cells (p=0.0029). Likewise, the rate of residual adherent cells was significantly higher with HPA-1b than HPA-1a cell clones (p 800 s \u22121 ) but not venous shear rates increased the observed conformational changes in adherent HPA-1b cells. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the prothrombotic phenotype of the HPA-1b variant is caused by increased outside-in signaling. The observed quantitative differences between both HPA-1 isoforms of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 are related to distinct conformational changes in their C-terminal cytoplasmic tails. These findings are in agreement with the contention that the HPA-1 polymorphism of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 can have a major impact on platelet adhesion, aggregation and thrombus formation under pathological conditions resulting from abnormally high shear stress.
