    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4993 Objective: To investigate prognostic significance of cytogenetics abnormalities, staging, patient factors, serum p53 protein concentration with Non\u2013Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Methods: 43 patients with NHL were identified form August 2003 to December 2010. The clinical characteristics of these cases were performed by morphological, immunohistochemical, cytogenetic analyses and quantitative detection of human serum p53 protein were performed. Results: After conventional chemotherapy, a higher proportion of complete/ partial remission (CR/PR) rates and a prolonged overall survival (OS) in patients with early-stage(I\u2013II) lymphoma, normal karyotype and lower level of Serum p53 protein compared with patients with advanced-stage (III\u2013IV) lymphoma, cytogenetic abnormalities and higher p53 protein level (\u22650.35U/ml) in serum, respectively. Bone marrow infiltration is also a predictor of poor response and OS. No statistical difference was noted with respect to the rate of disease remission between male versus female(<70 years versus \u226570 years), B-cell lymphoma versus T-cell lymphoma subgroups. Conclusions: Staging is an effective way of assessing disease extent; Cytogenetic examination provided useful information on diagnosis, staging and prognostic estimation; Serum p53 protein level may be a potential prognostic marker in patients with NHL.
