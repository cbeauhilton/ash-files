    "abstract_text": "The NUP98 gene has been reported to be fused with at least 17 partner genes in leukemia with 11p15 translocation. An adult patient with de novo acute myeloid/T lymphocytic leukemia harboring t(3;11)(q29q13;p15) has been investigated to characterize the genes involved in that translocation. Through molecular cytogenetic analysis, we identified a fusion transcript between NUP98 gene and a novel partner gene named as NUP98 related gene ( NRG) at 3q29. Further molecular analysis showed that exon 13 of NUP98 was fused in-frame to exon 10 of NRG . Moreover, the segment from 3q13 to 3q29 translocated at 11p15 had been inverted and accompanied by the deletion of the distal portion of breakpoint at chromosome 3q29. Interestingly, the NUP98-NRG protein showed nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution, a pattern different from that of wild type NUP98 or NRG. When assayed in a GAL 4 reporter system, the fusion gene showed an aberrant trans-regulatory activity. Transfection in HL-60 cells demonstrated that NUP98-NRG could promote cell proliferation, survival and arrest differentiation. Therefore, NUP98-NRG may exert transforming effects by interfering with the cellular mechanism of transcriptional regulation. Our data provide thus new evidence that NUP98 -related molecular abnormality is a recurrent genetic event in leukemogenesis.",
