    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Clinical tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which manifests most often as acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and devastating complication of rapidly proliferating hematologic malignancies. Epidemiologic studies of attributable risk factors for AKI in this setting are small, focus on only aggressive lymphomas rather than the more prevalent intermediate risk disease subtypes, and predate contemporary risk stratification, diagnostic criteria, and supportive care. Additionally, early administration of rasburicase to enhance uric acid (UA) elimination has been adopted without robust evidence in support of its impact on clinical outcomes, specifically, prevention of AKI. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of adult lymphoma patients at intermediate or high risk for TLS treated at Mayo Clinic between 2009 and 2017. Patients were excluded if they had AKI at hospital admission, received pre-admission rasburicase, or were on dialysis. Consensus definitions were used to stratify TLS risk and stage AKI. The incidence of new AKI in the setting of TLS was described along with predictors of its development, including early rasburicase use. Results: Of the 461 patients with a new lymphoma diagnosis during the study timeframe at intermediate or high risk of TLS, 78 were excluded, primarily due to prevalent AKI at hospital admission. The 383 included patients were predominantly at intermediate risk for TLS (73%) and had a diagnosis of Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (64%). Incidence of new onset AKI during hospitalization was 6% and 91% of cases were stage 1. All new onset AKI occurred within the first 5 days of hospital admission. Independent predictors of new AKI included age > 60 years, history of chronic kidney disease or cardiovascular disease, and UA >8 mg/dL at any time during hospital admission. Rasburicase was given to 48 patients, 6 (13%) of whom still went on to develop AKI. Rapid UA reduction with rasburicase did not impact the risk of developing AKI (HR 2.3; p = 0.11). Uric acid level at the time of administration did not modify the effect of rasburicase on prevention of AKI (p = 0.36 for the interaction term). Conclusion: In conclusion, for lymphoma patients at intermediate or high risk for TLS, if not present at admission, AKI only infrequently developed during the course of a patient's hospitalization. Predictors of AKI included advanced age, comorbid conditions, and elevated UA levels. Early rasburicase administration, regardless of UA level, did not alter AKI risk.
