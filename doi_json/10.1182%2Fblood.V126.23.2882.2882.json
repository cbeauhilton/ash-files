    "abstract_text": "Background: Addition of sex combs-like 1 ( ASXL1 ) is frequently mutated (mutational frequency 14-29%) and is prognostically relevant in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) ( Bejar, NEJM 2011, Thol, JCO 2011 ). The prevalence and prognostic impact of ASXL1 mutation in MDS with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS) is not known. MDS-RS is defined by the presence of \u226515% RS in bone marrow (BM), with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) being the prototype but may also be seen in other categories. Methods : Our institutional database was reviewed to identify patients with WHO-defined primary MDS with \u22651% BM RS. Pathology slides, including iron stains, were reviewed to accurately quantify BM RS percentage and confirm WHO morphologic categories. All patients were annotated for their mutational status including ASXL1, JAK2 , MPL and IDH with a subset for SF3B1 by PCR sequencing performed on BM specimens obtained at diagnosis. Results : i) Patient characteristics: A total of 76 MDS patients displayed \u22651% BM RS (median age 72 years; 76% males); 51 (67%) patients had \u226515% BM RS. IPSS-R risk categories for the entire 76 study patients were 30% very low, 37% low, 14% intermediate, 11% high and 8% very high; IPSS-R karyotype was normal in 63%, very good/good risk 17%, intermediate risk 12%, and poor/very poor in 8%; 3% had monosomal karyotype. ii) Prevalence of ASXL1 mutations: Twenty-one (28%) of the 76 study patients were ASXL1 mutated; ASXL1 mutational frequencies were 25% (16/63 patients) in the absence and 38% (5/13 patients) in the presence of excess blasts ( P =0.34). When considering only those patients with \u226515% BM RS ( n =51), ASXL1 mutations were detected in 12 (24%) patients with mutational frequencies of 24% (11/46 patients) in the absence and 20% (1/5 patients) in the presence of excess blasts ( P =0.84); ASXL1 mutational frequencies were 13% (3/23 patients) in RARS and 37% (7/19 patients) in RCMD-RS (P=0.07). In terms of other mutations, all 76 study patients were wild-type for JAK2 and MPL , whereas IDH2 R140Q mutations were present in 4 (5%) patients, including 3 with concomitant ASXL1 and IDH2 mutations. IDH1 mutation was seen in only 1 patient. 25 of 43 (58%) patients screened were mutated for SF3B1 , including 4 (9%) who were mutated for both ASXL1 and SF3B1 . Significant associations were evident between ASXL1 and IDH2 mutations ( P =0.02) but not between ASXL1 and SF3B1 mutations ( P =0.61). iii) Clinical correlates of ASXL1 mutations: Among all 76 study patients, presence of ASXL1 mutation did not correlate with age ( P =0.30), hemoglobin level ( P =0.17), platelet count ( P =0.53), BM blast percentage ( P =0.17), WHO morphologic category ( P =0.34), transfusion dependence ( P =0.84), IPSS-R cytogenetic categories ( P =0.93), or IPSS-R risk group ( P =0.33). The results were unchanged when analyzing the 51 patients with MDS-RS (i.e. \u226515% BM RS). Amongst the ASXL1 mutated patients ( n =21) IPSS-R cytogenetic categories were as follows: 13 patients with normal karyotype (62%), 2 patients with trisomy 8 (10%), 1 patient each with -Y, del(11q), del(5q), del(20q), isochromosome 17 and monosomy 7 (5% each). iv) Prognostic impact of ASXL1 mutations: Median follow-up was 42.5 months, during which time 69 (91%) deaths and 8 (11%) leukemic transformations were documented. ASXL1 mutated patients had a median survival of 29 months, compared to 45 months in ASXL1 wild-type patients ( P =0.04). However, the difference in median survival was no longer significant during multivariable analysis, which instead identified only IPSS-R and transfusion need as being independent predictors of inferior survival. Amongst those patients without excess blasts ( n =63), presence of ASXL1 mutation predicted inferior survival in univariate analysis ( P =.04) and significance was sustained during multivariable analysis that included IPSS-R cytogenetic categories ( P =.04) but became borderline when WHO morphologic category was included ( P =0.06); ASXL1 mutated patients had a shortened median survival of 43 months compared to 66 months in ASXL1 wild-type patients ( P =.04). In the presence of \u226515% BM RS, ASXL1 mutations did not affect survival ( P =0.48); the results were the same for RARS ( P =0.9) and RCMD-RS ( P =0.64). Conclusions : ASXL1 mutations might not affect survival in MDS patients with \u226515% BM RS, including those with RARS or RCMD-RS. Furthermore, an apparent survival disadvantage seen in ASXL1 -mutated MDS patients with \u22651% BM RS was accounted for by IPSS-R. Disclosures Pardanani: Stemline: Research Funding.",
