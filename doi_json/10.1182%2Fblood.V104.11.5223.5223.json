    "abstract_text": "Background: For a long time, multiple myeloma has been a disease with a poor outcome. High dose (melphalan) chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation has been reported to improve the overall and progression-free survival of these patients. Objective: To determine the survival of multiple myeloma patients treated with conventional chemotherapy and compare it with that of patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Design/Methods: 83 myeloma patients treated at a single institution were included in this retrospective study. They were divided into two groups: one group of patients who were received high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (n=42) and one group of patients who only received conventional chemotherapy and were eventually also treated with thalidomide and/or corticosteroids (n=41). The distribution of the stages of the disease according to Salmon and Durie were similar in both groups of patients. For both groups, the overall and progression-free survival was calculated. Results: In the general analysis, myeloma patients who underwent an autologous transplant had a significantly longer overall survival (58.8 vs. 52.2 months, p=0.036) and progression-free survival (39.6 vs. 11.8 months, p < 0.001) in comparison with the conventional chemotherapy group. If analysis was restricted to those patients who were transplanted as a first-line treatment, there was no significant difference in overall survival in comparison with conventional chemotherapy (51.8 vs. 52.2 months, p= 0.422); progression-free survival was significantly better in the first-line transplant arm as compared to the conventional chemotherapy arm (35.4 vs. 11.8 months, p= 0.003). As the median age in the transplant arm was significantly lower than in the conventional chemotherapy arm, we also performed a sub-analysis of patients who were between 60 and 70 years of age at diagnosis; there was no significant difference in overall survival between the two groups (60.7 vs. 69.5 months, p= 0.656), while the progression-free survival was again better in the autologous transplant group as compared to the conventional chemotherapy group (41.0 vs. 8.4 months, p= 0.020). Conclusion: High-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation in the treatment of myeloma is associated with improved progression-free survival and in the general analysis, with improved overall survival. The overall survival of patients who were only treated with conventional chemotherapy is somewhat higher (more than 4 years) as compared to that of historical controls (2\u20133 years).",
