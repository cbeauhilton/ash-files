    "abstract_text": "B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS also called BAFF), is a potent cell survival factor expressed in many hematopoietic cells. However, many aspects of BLyS signaling pathway remain unclear. In order to investigate BLyS signaling pathway, we studied the function of BAFF-R (also called BR3), a major BLyS receptor, in normal and neoplastic B cell survival and proliferation. In our initial study, we found that BAFF-R was also present in nucleus, in addition to its presence in the plasma membrane of B cells. A candidate nuclear localization sequence was identified in the BAFF-R protein sequence. We also found BAFF-R mediated transcriptional activity, that could be increased through over expression of a NF-\u03baB family member c-rel. Further study showed that BAFF-R co-localized with, c-rel in the nucleus and bound to the NF-\u03baB binding site on the promoters of NF-\u03baB target genes such as BLyS, CD154, Bcl-xL, Bfl-1/A1 and IL-8. The I\u03baB kinase (IKK) protein complex is critical for regulating NF-\u03baB pathway activation. The IKK complex includes three important subunits: the catalytic subunits IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 (also known as IKK1 and IKK2) and the regulatory subunit IKK\u03b3 (also known as NEMO). In the cytoplasm, activation of the IKK complex induces processing of precursors p105 and p100 into p50 and p52 respectively, resulting in NF-\u03baB subunit dimeric partners that migrate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. In recent studies, IKK\u03b1 has also been identified in the cell nucleus, functioning in histone H3 phosphorylation. Although IKK\u03b2 was also previously observed in the cell nucleus, its nuclear function has been obscure. Besides functioning as a transcriptional co-factor with c-rel, we also found BAFF-R interacted with IKK\u03b2 in the nucleus of normal and neoplastic (lymphoma) B cells, enhancing histone H3 phosphorylation through IKK\u03b2 by immuno precipitation experiments and in vitro kinase assays. Inhibition of BAFF-R entry into the nucleus by BAFF-R NLS mutant transfection, decreased the level of phosphorylated histone H3 compared to the controls in NHL-B cells. These findings not only demonstrate a novel nuclear function of IKK\u03b2, but also determine a new mechanism of how BAFF-R promotes survival and proliferation of normal B cells and NHL-B cells. In addition to activating NF-\u03baB pathways in the plasma membrane, BAFF-R also functions as a transcriptional regulator binding to NF-\u03baB targeted gene promoters possibly through a chromatin remodeling mechanism(s).",
