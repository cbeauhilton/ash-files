    "abstract_text": "Approximately 60% of thalassemic patients can not apply to \u201cgene therapy today\u201d which the insertion of one allogenic HLA identical stem cell into the empty bone marrow as the vector of the normal gene for beta globin chain synthesis. We studied the use of the haploidentical mother as the donor of hematopoietic stem cells assuming that the immuno-tollerance established during the pregnancy will help to bypass the HLA disparity and allow the hemopoietic allogeneic reconstitution in the thalassemic recipient of the transplant. We have employed a new preparative regimen for the transplant in fourteen thalassemic children aged 3 to 12 years (median age 5 years) using T cell depleted peripheral blood stem cell (PBSCTs) plus bone marrow (BM) stem cells. All patients received hydroxyurea (OHU) 60 mg/kg and azathioprine 3 mg/kg from day -59 until day-11, fludarabine (FLU) 30 mg/m 2 from day -17 to day -11, busulphan (BU) 14 mg/kg starting on day -10, and cyclophosphamide(CY) 200mg/kg, Thiotepa 10 mg/kg and ATG Sangstat 2.5 mg/kg, followed by a CD34 + t cell depleted (CliniMacs system), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-csf) mobilized PBSC from their HLA haploidentical mother. The purity of CD34+ cells after MACS sorting was 98\u201399%, the average number of transplanted CD34+ cells was 15, 4 x 10 6/kg and the average number of infused T lymphocytes from BM was 1,8 x 10 5/Kg.The patients received cyclosporin after transplant for graft versus host disease(GVHD) prophylaxis during the first two months after the bone marrow transplantation. Results. Thirteen patients are alive. Four patients rejected the transplant and are alive with thalassemia One patients died six months after bone marrow transplant for central nervous system diffuse large B cell lymphoma EBV related. Nine patients are alive disease free with a median follow up of 30 months (range12\u201347). None of the seven patients showed AGVHD and CGVHD. This preliminary study suggest that the transplantation of megadose of haploidentical CD34+ cell from the mother is a realistic therapeutic option for those thalassemic patients without genotipically or phenotipically HLA identical donor.",
