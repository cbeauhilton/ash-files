    "abstract_text": "Early thymic progenitors enter the thymus and are exposed to regional hypoxia while they develop in a step-wise manner to mature functional T-cells. Therefore, hypoxia might represent an important component of the highly specialized thymic microenvironment. On the molecular level the hypoxia-inducible factor pathway controls the cellular response to hypoxia. In this pathway, the von-Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) continuously mediates the destruction of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) under normoxic conditions. Under hypoxia HIF-1\u03b1 degradation is inhibited leading to the activation of HIF-1\u03b1 target genes. Others used lck-Cre transgene-mediated conditional in vivo deletion of the Vhl gene to study the role of the oxygen-sensing pathway in developing thymocytes and found normal numbers of early double-negative (DN; CD4-CD8-) thymocytes (Biju et al., Mol Cell Biol, 2004). However, lck-Cre deletion initiates at the DN3 (CD25+CD44-) stage leaving the Vhl locus of very early DN1 (CD25-CD44+), DN2 (CD25+CD44+) and DN3 thymocytes unaltered. Therefore, we here used the ubiquitous hematopoietic deleter strain vav-Cre to investigate the role of pVHL in very early thymocytes ( vav-Cre;Vhl loxP;loxP mice). Using a PCR-based strategy we confirmed complete deletion of the Vhl gene in this model. We observed unaltered DN1 and DN2 progenitor numbers, however in contrast to the published lck-cre -mediated system we consistently observed an up to twofold expansion of the DN3 cellular compartment. As the hypoxia-inducible factor pathway was shown to modulate NOTCH1 signaling we studied Notch1 expression on Vhl -deficient thymocytes. Strikingly, Notch1 expression was significantly increased on expanded Vhl null DN3 thymocytes. At the DN3 developmental stage selection of cells with an accurately re-arranged T-cell receptor \u03b2-locus occurs. Thus, we analyzed pre- and post-\u03b2-selection DN3 cells by CD28 staining. Interestingly, we found both pre- and post-\u03b2-selection DN3 subpopulations expanded. In order to investigate whether the progenitor expansion is mediated by the lack of HIF-1\u03b1 inhibition in the Vhl -deficient context we studied DN3 thymocytes in a conditional hematopoietic HIF-1\u03b1 gain-of-function model ( vav-Cre;HIF1dPA ). Overexpression of HIF-1\u03b1, which is insensitive to pVHL-mediated degradation in vav-Cre;HIF1dPA mice, also resulted in expanded DN3 thymocytes. In summary, we describe novel conditional models to genetically alter the hypoxia-inducible factor pathway within very early thymic progenitors. Genetic Vhl loss led to an expansion of DN3 thymocytes. This DN3 expansion is most likely due to the absence of HIF-1\u03b1-inhibition, because HIF-1\u03b1 overexpression phenocopied the Vhl -deficient DN3 thymocyte expansion.
