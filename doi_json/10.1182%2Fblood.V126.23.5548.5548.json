    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Genetic modification of autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) is a promising clinical intervention to cure inherited monogenic diseases. Successful gene therapy trials have already been conducted using CD34+ cells from bone marrow and from mobilized peripheral blood. In this regard, cord blood (CB) represents an attractive source of HSCs due to its high concentration of high proliferative HSPC and increased susceptibility to be transduced by lentiviral vectors. Unfortunately, the major disadvantage is the limited number of HSC in the CB collection. Consequently, ex-vivo expansion of CB-HSC is desirable to extend clinical applications. Purposes: To investigate the ability of UCB-cd34+ cells to be expanded in serum-free media supplemented with the early acting hematopoietic cytokines SCF,TPO and Flt-3 ligant (STF) and to characterize CD34+ cells subtypes, clonogenic capacity and gene expression profile during expansion. We also wanted to investigate the susceptibility of the expanded cd34+ cells to be transduced by a GFP-lentiviral vector (LV-GFP) Material and Methods: CD34+ immunoselected cells from 10 UCB were grown for 8 days in customized serum-free medium formulated for HSC expansion, supplemented with STF cytokines. Numbers end frequency of CD34+cells and co-expression of the primitive surface antigens (CD38, CD133, CD90) was evaluated during expansion. Colonies developed in methylcellulose were scored for enumeration ad typing. LV-GFP transduction efficiency was evaluated in CD34+ cells cultured for 4 days in expansion medium plus STF and for 24 hrs in X-vivo10 medium with STF\u00b1IL-3 cytokines; the last condition slightly expands CD34+ cells (1.3 fold) and are currently used for HSPC-lentivector transduction in gene therapy clinical trials. The transduction efficiency was evaluated by measuring the percentage of GFP+ cells in the bulk and in colonies developed in methylcellulose and the VCN/cell by Q-PCR. Gene expression profiles were analyzed by human whole genome Agilent microarray Technology to detect differentially expressed genes between expanded, ex-vivo medium cultured and un-cultured cells. Results: We found an average of 8 fold-increase CD34+cells at day 4 and of 22 fold- increase at day 8 of culture. The frequency of CD34+ was maintained at day 4 and declined of about 50% at day 8. CD34+/CD38- early progenitors doublet as early as day 4, differences in CD34+/CD133+ and CD34+/CD90+cells were not significant. The number of CFU slightly increased during expansion while the relative frequency of colonies type did not significantly changed. Four days expanded CD34+ cells were transduced more efficiently than those grown in ex-vivo medium even in presence of IL-3 added to the STF cytokine cocktail. Comprehensive gene expression profile analysis highlighted about 4000 genes differentially expressed in CD34+ cells expanded for 4 and for 8 days compared to that of the un-cultured cells. Conversely, the expression profiles analysis did not show any clear separation between different cell culture methods (expansion vs ex-vivo medium). Specifically, the number of differentially expressed genes in common between the different culture conditions compared with the un-cultured cells was statistically significant. Unsurprisingly, the common up-regulated genes were related to the cell cycle. The likeness between the gene expression profiles of the different culture conditions was also validated by the identification of a significantly small number of differentially expressed genes between them. Conclusions: UCB-CD34+ cells can be efficiently expanded and transduced in serum free conditions. The expanded cells exhibited phenotypic marchers typical of early progenitors and developed colonies in number and in type similar to the unmanipulated cells and exhibited whole gene expression profile that is consisted with that of CD34+ cells exposed for the short term culture conditions currently used in gene therapy trial mediated by lentiviral vectors. Results from this study open a window on the future possibility of using homologous UCB-HSC as target for gene correction in patients diagnosed for a genetic disorder in prenatal time. The genetically modified cells would be stored and used for gene therapy in the same individual in pediatric age.
