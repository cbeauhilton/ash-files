CD 117 , whether the cell surface is expressed and the quality of its expression, is highly correlated with the tyrosine kinase selective inhibitors. And whether Multiple myeloma (MM) cells express CD 117 and its expression quality is not reported domestic yet but only several reported overseas. In this study, CD 117 expressed in MM cells is evaluated, which provide an theoretical evidence for tyrosine kinase selective inhibitors used in the MM, meanwhile, the value of the CD 117 expressed in MM cells is estimated. METHODS: CD 117 ,CD 56, CD 54 were measured by three -color flow cytometry with CD45/SSC gating strategy. RESULTS: Of 48 patients with MM, 17(35.5%) CD 117 expression was positive in myeloma cells, and CD 56 , CD 54 expression was positive in 39(81.2%), 48(100.0%), respectively. CD 117 expression in myeloma cells was low compared with CD 56 , CD 54 in 48 patients with MM; CD 117 positive expression showed a positive correlation with myeloma cells in the bone marrow; CD 117 positive in IgG type of MM was 64%, higher than other types such as light chain or IgA.CD 117 positive showed no significant difference in different stage, untreated, relapsed and refractory patients (P>0.05, P>0.01); In untreated MM patient, chemotherapy of VAD in CD 117 positive patient, the effectiveness was 71.4%, compared with the reaction rate 66.7% in CD 117 negative, showed no significant difference (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CD 117 </SU",
