    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have demonstrated the clinical activity of the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 in low- grade lymphomas. Our preclinical studies demonstrated activity of mTOR inhibitors in Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM) cell lines and patient samples. This phase II study aimed to determine safety and activity of the oral mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (Novartis Pharmaceutical, MA) in patients with relapsed or refractory WM. METHODS: Patients who had at least one previous therapy for WM, and who had symptomatic relapsed or refractory disease were eligible. NCI CTCAE v3.0 was used for toxicity assessment. All patients received daily RAD001 at 10 mg. A cycle was considered 28 days. Patients were allowed to stay on therapy until progression of disease or excessive toxicity. This study was conducted in a collaborative effort between Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) and Mayo Clinic College of Medicine. Here, we report the data on the patients accrued at DFCI. RESULTS: 19 pts (15 men and 4 women) have been treated to date. All patients had symptomatic disease and required therapy. The median number of lines of prior treatment was 3 (range 1 \u2013 5) including included rituximab, nucleoside analogues (fludarabine or 2-CDA), combination chemotherapy (e.g. CHOP, CVP), chloramucil, and bortezomib. The median IgM at baseline was 3330 mg/dL (range 1010\u2013 7410). The median follow on RAD001 was 8 months (range 3 \u2013 22 months). Eighteen pts are currently evaluable for response. Best responses to RAD001 after 2 cycles using IgM monoclonal protein were as follows: partial remission in 8 (44%), minimal response in 5 (28%). Progressive disease occurred in 4 (22%) and stable disease occurred in 1 (6%). The overall response rate (PR+MR) was 72%. The median duration of response has not been reached (3\u201322+ months). Patients tolerated therapy well without significant toxicities. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities included grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 1 patient, grade 3 pneumonia in 1 patient, grade 3 hyperglycemia in 1 patient and grade 3 mucositis in 1 patient. Other adverse events of grade 2 or lower included nail cracking, mucositis, diarrhea, and fatigue. Attributable toxicities otherwise proved manageable with appropriate supportive care, and RAD001 was generally well tolerated. One patient enrolled on the study withdrew consent and changed to hospice care within 3 weeks of therapy, and passed away due to disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the oral RAD001 single agent RAD001 in patients with relapsed or refractory WM was welltolerated and demonstrated significant activity achieving an overall response rate in 72% of patients. Future studies of combination of this agent with rituximab and bortezomib are currently being planned.",
