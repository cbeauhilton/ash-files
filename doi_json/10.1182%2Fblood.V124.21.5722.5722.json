    "abstract_text": "Background Ig light chain (LC) diseases such as AL amyloidosis and monoclonal light-chain deposition disease are caused by pathologic free LC. Treatment is aimed at eliminating LC production but success is limited. RNA interference (RNAi) can stop LC production but the diversity of LC variable region sequences poses a challenge that targeting consensus sequences in the constant region (CR) of LC mRNA may overcome (Blood 2014;123:3440). We have developed siRNA pools designed to target the \u03ba or \u03bb LC CR mRNA in human plasma cells and impair LC production and secretion, and have shown that the pool targeting the \u03bb LC CR can do so, and can also trigger a terminal unfolded protein response in clones producing intact Ig due to intracellular accumulation of unpaired heavy chains (ibid). Here we report the results of continued in vitro and in vivo testing of these pools in patient specimens and in a murine xenograft model. Methods Pools of siRNA for the \u03ba or \u03bb LC CR (si[ IGLC\u03ba CR ], si[ IGLC\u03bb CR ]) were custom produced with a non-target control (si[-]). They were introduced in vitro into human plasma cells by an optimized streptolysin O-based method (SLO) and in a NOD.SCID xenograft flank plasmacytoma model by in vivo electroporation as per Gene Therapy 2011;18:1150. In vitro we evaluated LC gene expression, production and secretion at 24 hours in human myeloma cell lines and CD138-selected specimens from patients with plasma cell neoplasms, using real-time PCR (qPCR) for LC mRNA, flow cytometry for intracellular LC mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and ELISA (Bethyl Laboratories) for LC secretion in 24-hour suspension cultures (10 6 cells/ml). In vivo we inoculated each of the flanks of NOD.SCID mice with 10 7 human myeloma cells (ALMC-1 or ALMC-2). When plasmacytomas were 0.5cm 3 we injected si[ IGLC\u03bb CR ] or si[-] one time to each flank plasmacytoma respectively, allowing each mouse to serve as its own control. Two days later, the mice were sacrificed and the plasmacytomas excised for qPCR for \u03bb LC mRNA and serum was obtained to measure human \u03bb LC levels by ELISA. Results We have previously described results with siRNA targeting the \u03bb LC CR in human cell lines that make \u03bb LC (ALMC-1, ALMC-2, EJM, OPM2, MM.1S, and MM.1R) and in 16 AL \u03bb patient specimens. We demonstrated significant decreases in LC mRNA, intracellular LC MFI, and \u03bb LC secretion by cell lines (Blood 2014;123:3220); moreover, transcriptional profiling indicated minimal off-target effects (ibid; Supplement). We now report that in vitro secretion of \u03bb LC by CD138-selected plasma cells from AL patients (n=3, newly diagnosed \u03bb) treated with si[ IGLC\u03bb CR ] was reduced by 65% from a mean of 3.1 to 1.0\u00b5g/ml and that the residual \u03bb LC mRNA was 49% of control. Similarly we treated \u03ba LC secreting human myeloma cell lines with si[ IGLC\u03ba CR ] and si[-] (IM9, H929, JJN-3, and ARH77). By qPCR the residual \u03ba LC mRNA was 13%, by flow cytometry the MFI was reduced by a median of 67.3% (22.5-90.8), and by ELISA mean \u03ba LC secretion was reduced from 3.7 to 0.8\u00b5g/ml ( P = 0.055, paired t test). We treated CD138-selected \u03ba patient samples (AL 3, LCDD 1, MM 6) in the same way. By qPCR the residual \u03ba LC mRNA was 57% control, by flow cytometry the MFI was reduced by a median of 37.5% (14-69.8), and by ELISA secretion was reduced from 9.4 to 6.5\u00b5g/ml ( P = 0.02, paired t test). In the murine dual-flank xenograft model employing \u03bb secreting cells, by qPCR there was a reduction in \u03bb LC mRNA with si[ IGLC\u03bb CR ] treatment in 13 of 16 mice (ALMC-1 11/114, ALMC-2 2/2). In these 14, the median \u03bb LC expression was 66% of control (range, 17-97). In 6/13 the average reduction in \u03bb LC expression was 59%. Of note, measurable levels of human \u03bb LC were found in the blood of all mice at sacrifice. Conclusion With one pool of siRNA targeting the constant region of the \u03ba or \u03bb LC we can significantly reduce production and secretion of LC by clonal human plasma cells, including patient cells, and also reduce the expression of LC in xenograft plasmacytomas in vivo . Two methods of siRNA delivery have been employed in this work thus far, SLO and in vivo electroporation, neither of which require endosomal escape. The specificity of the siRNA pools for plasma cell LC genes and the possible receptivity of plasma cells to RNAi are important positive aspects of this work. Further pre-clinical development of Ig LC CR RNAi employing lipid-based nanoparticle platforms is warranted in order to optimize cell-specific delivery, delivery efficiency and siRNA targeting.
