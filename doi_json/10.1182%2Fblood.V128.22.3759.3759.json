    "abstract_text": "Introduction Gamma- (\u03b3-) carboxylation of glutamate residues is a vitamin K-dependent post-translational modification critical to the function of several plasma proteins. Found in the N-terminal domains of specific proteins, most of which are involved in hemostasis, these \u03b3-carboxyglutamate residues (Gla) help mediate binding of divalent cations and are essential to protein function. Coagulation factor VII (a) bears 10 known Gla residues as characterized by N-terminal sequencing, yet Thim et al.( Biochemistry 27:7785 1988) used amino acid analysis to quantify 11.0 mol of Gla/mol of protein for plasma-derived factor VII (a) . We used mass spectrometry to map and validate Gla residues of coagulation factor VII (a) to potentially identify Gla residues outside of the Gla domain. Methods Four sources of factor VII (a) (2 plasma-derived and 2 recombinant) were extracted, digested, and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Each sample was digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin to provide orthogonal coverage. Peptides derived from factor VII (a) proteolysis were analyzed on a nanoLC coupled to a quadrupole-Orbitrap-quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Thermo Scientific). Multiple fragmentation methods were used to map and validate the sites including collisional based dissociation (CAD), higher energy collisional activated dissociation (HCD), electron transfer dissociation (ETD), and electron-transfer/higher-energy electron transfer activation (EThcD). Tandem MS spectra were collected at resolution 30K at 200 m/z, and data were processed using MaxQuant, COMPASS, and Proteome Discoverer. All identified sites were validated through manual annotation of spectra. We estimate that any site with >1% occupancy will be identified as Gla with this method. To validate select sites of novel gamma carboxylation, synthetic peptides were made for 4 different sites that were consistently identified in factor VII (a) from all 4 sources. Synthetic peptides were analyzed using MS methods described above, generating \"true positives\" to match with peptides identified from the factor VII (a) sources. Spectra from the synthetic peptides and factor VII from each source were compared using manual spectral annotation. Results In addition to identifying known Gla residues at positions 6, 7, 19, 20, 29, and 35 of factor VII (a) , we detected and validated 9 novel Gla residues outside of the N-terminal Gla domain. Novel sites include residues 94, 116, 132, 219, 215, 229, 265, 196 and 385. Four of these residues (210, 220, 296 and 385) were identified as Gla in all 4 sources of factor VII (a) and were validated with synthetic peptides using a combination of fragmentation methods, providing high confidence in their characterization. Published crystallographic data suggest that residues 210 and 220 of factor VIIa-tissue factor are closely approximated to a Ca 2+ ion complexed to the C-terminal protease domain; this is not the case for residues 296 and 385. We continue to refine the technique to map the Gla residues (novel and known), and to quantify the fraction of factor VII (a) molecules from each source that contain the modification at each site, in order to better incorporate our data with established studies showing >90% occupancy at each of the 10 Gla domain sites. These data suggest there is room to expand our understanding of how carboxylation contributes to specific protein function, in order to provide more comprehensive understanding of this post-translational modification, and refine our understanding of hemostatic mechanisms.
