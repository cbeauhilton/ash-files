    "abstract_text": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a heterogeneous disease, initiated by reciprocal translocation of chromosome 9 and 22, resulting in the generation of a BCR-ABL fusion protein and constitutive activation of the ABL kinase. ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been very successful in suppressing CML disease. However, TKIs may not eliminate leukemia stem cells (LSCs), as evidenced by the frequent re-emergence of the disease upon TKI discontinuation. Moreover, blast phase CML (bpCML) remains a formidable challenge in disease management. Recent clinical evidence suggests that the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax (Ven) in combination with ABL-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) can eradicate bpCML LSCs. However, the exact mechanism by which this combination may targets LSCs is not known. In this report, we confirm the efficacy and LSC-targeting capacity of Ven/TKI combination in preclinical models of bpCML and we further identify that inhibition of free fatty acid (FFA) mobilization pathways may provide enhanced efficacy against LSCs. To establish the efficacy of Ven/TKI combination, we treated bpCML samples with Ven+Dasatinib (Das) combination for 24h, this resulted in a significant decrease in the viability of bulk and primitive populations (CD34+, CD38+). Patient-derived xenografts of bpCML samples in NSGS-mice, were treated with Ven/Das as well as single agents. The result showed a significant decrease in leukemia burden in the combination treated group, compared to either drug alone, albeit, some resistant cells survived in the combo treated group. Furthermore, using a syngeneic mouse model of bpCML, co-expressing Bcr-Abl and Nup98-HOXA9 translocations, the mouse leukemic cells treated with Ven/Dasatinib combination demonstrated a significant loss of viability of the bulk as well as phenotypically defined LSCs (Lin-/Sca1+). Treatment of leukemic mice with Ven/Das had a significant survival benefit and remained disease free at 80 days post treatment. We also showed significant survival benefits of Ven/ponatinib in NSGS-mice harboring syngeneic bpCML cells with the T315I gatekeeper mutation. Treatment of normal mice with Ven/Das combo did not affect the colony forming ability of LSK cells from the bone marrow, indicating a leukemia-specific response. Based on these results, we conclude that Ven/TKI combination effects were due to direct targeting of the LSC population. To investigate the potential mechanism of Ven/TKI activity in LSC targeting, we performed gene expression studies using RNA-seq based methods after short term treatment. Our findings indicated that the LSC population from Ven/TKI-treated mice showed enrichment of a gene signature associated with lysosome biology. Pre-treatment of mouse leukemia cells with bafilomycin, an inhibitor of lysosome function, resulted in increased sensitivity to Ven/TKI combo. Intriguingly, we also found significant induction of lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA), an enzyme involved in the generation of free fatty acids for energy needs. Metabolomic analysis of LSCs isolated after short term treatment with Ven/TKI, showed that a number of fatty acids were up-regulated in the Ven/Das treated group compared to control. Knocking down Lipa using CRISPR technology resulted in increased sensitivity to Ven/TKI combination, whereas overexpression of Lipa resulted in decreased sensitivity to the Ven/TKI combination, implicating Lipa upregulation and a resultant increase in free fatty acids as a protective response to Ven/TKI treatment. Furthermore, knocking down CPT1A, an important free fatty acid mitochondrial transporter, resulted in increased sensitivity to Ven/TKI combination both in mouse and primary human leukemic cells, leading to the hypothesis that activation of fatty acid processing through enhanced Lipa activity may represent a compensatory response to venetoclax based therapies in bpCML. In summary, we demonstrate the preclinical efficacy of Ven/TKI combination therapies for targeting of bpCML LSCs. Furthermore, our data suggest that blocking upregulation of free fatty acids through mechanisms such as inhibition of LIPA activity, might synergize with Ven/TKI combinations to eradicate LSCs, allowing for more durable response. Our findings provide a therapeutic rationale for blocking pathways involved in free fatty acids generation, as a potential strategy for increasing remission duration.
