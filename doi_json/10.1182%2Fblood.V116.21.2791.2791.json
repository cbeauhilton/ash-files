    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2791 Introduction: Elderly mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients (pts) do not benefit from dose-intensive chemotherapy upfront. 1 The GOELAMS group recently demonstrated that a regimen comprising Vincristine/Adriamycine/Dexamethasone plus Chlorambucil (VAD+C) was well tolerated, had a good efficacy/toxicity profile and induced similar PFS than R-CHOP (median PFS between 16 to 18 months 2,3,4 ). Additionally, it has been shown that bortezomib (Velcade\u00ae), with or without Rituximab has efficacy in relapsed/refractory MCL patients 5,6 . These data prompted, our group to conducte a phase II prospective non randomized clinical trial evaluating the combination of Velcade plus Rituximab/Adriblastine/Dexamethasone/Chlorambucil (RiPAD+C) as a first line therapy for elderly MCL patients. Aims: To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) and toxicity after 4 cycles of RiPAD+C regimen (main objective) and to evaluate prognostic factors for survival (secondary objective). Protocol: RiPAD+C : Rituximab 375 mg/m2 on d1 (and d8 for cycle 1); PS 341, Velcade\u00ae 1.3 mg/m2 on d1, 4, 8 and 11; Adriblastine 9mg/m2/d as a continuous infusion for 4 days; Dexamethasone 20 mgx2/d from d1 to d4; Chlorambucil 12 mg/d, d20 to d29. Repeat cycles every 35d. After 4 cycles, responding pts (Cheson 1999 criteria) received 2 additional cycles for a maximum of 6. Patients and methods: Inclusion criteria : All untreated elderly (65 to 80 years old) MCL patients (including blastoid forms) presenting with a stage II to IV disease with a good PS (ECOG<3) were eligible. Histologic samples were centrally reviewed and Ki67 expression was evaluated for each sample according to the European guidelines 7 . Results: Population : from June 2007 to December 2009, 39 pts were enrolled in the study with a majority of males (n=30). Median age at diagnosis was 72 years [65-80]. All patients had stage III/IV disease and PS was \u22652 in 5 cases (15%). Elevated serum LDH were observed in 47% of cases. According to the MIPI, 28 patients (80%) had an intermediate or high score. Eleven (30%) patients presented with a blastoid variant and Ki67 staining was superior to 30% in 12 cases (37%). Toxicity : A total of 195 courses have been performed. Fourteen hospitalization (median duration = 7 days [1 and 55]) due to toxicity were necessary involving 12 pts (34%). Seven pts (18%) experienced grade 3 peripheral neuropathy. ten (25%) pts required blood transfusions for a total of 8 red blood cells and 14 platelets transfusions. Response after 4 cycles : ORR was 80% (n=31) including 51% of CRs. Eight pts discontinued the treatment before reaching cycle 4, two of them for toxicity reasons. Six patients (15%) were refractory or in progression. Response after 6 cycles (n=25; 64%) : ORR was 74% including 20 pts in CRs (59%). Survival : With a median follow-up of 24 months, 27 pts are still alive. Two pts died of toxicity (severe sepsis) and 10 pts progressed. The median PFS is 26 months and the median OS has not been reached yet. According to the MIPI score, no differences in PFS were between pts with low and int/high scores. Conversely, the recently described Goelams index 2 stratified pts with a low score (normal LDH, Ki67\u226426%, PS\u22641, and no B symptoms) from patients with an int/high score (p=.055). Conclusion: The results of the current phase II trial indicate that the RiPAD+C regimen, integrating bortezomib, is feasible and well tolerated as a first line therapy in elderly MCL pts. Historical comparisons suggest that this regimen compares favourably to the classical R-CHOP regimen in terms of response rates and duration.
