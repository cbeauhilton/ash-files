    "abstract_text": "Design/Methods: We recently demonstrated in a phase III trial that the addition of rituximab to each of 8 cycles of CVP (R-CVP) chemotherapy significantly improves the clinical outcome of previously untreated patients with stage III/IV CD20 positive follicular NHL when compared to CVP alone ( Marcus et al., Blood  2005 ; 105 : 1417 \u201323 ). A multivariate Cox regression analysis of time to progression or death (TTP) showed a treatment benefit in all patient subgroups according to baseline risk factors, except for patients with a baseline hemoglobin level below normal. We now present an updated analysis of all major trial endpoints with 42 months follow-up (FU). Results: A total of 321 patients (median age 53 years) were recruited (159 CVP, 162 R-CVP). Approximately half of the patients had high-risk disease according to the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI, score 3\u20135). The median TTP was more than doubled for patients receiving R-CVP compared to CVP alone (33.6 months vs 14.5 months, p<0.0001). Median time to new lymphoma treatment or death (TNLT) was 12.3 months in the CVP group and nearly quadrupled to 46.3 months in the R-CVP group (p<0.0001). Superior response rates for R-CVP were confirmed (CR+CRu rate 41% vs 11%, p<0.0001) with a median response duration (DR) of 13.5 months in the CVP arm versus 37.7 months in the R-CVP arm. Median disease free survival (DFS) in complete responders was 44.8 months for patients receiving R-CVP and 20.5 months in patients receiving CVP alone (p=0.0005). Thirty-five patients in the CVP arm and 23 patients in the R-CVP arm have died. Kaplan-Meier estimates of 3-year OS rates were 81% in the CVP arm and 89% in the R-CVP (p=0.07). Importantly, significantly more patients receiving CVP died due to lymphoma progression compared to patients receiving R-CVP (25 vs 12 deaths, p=0.02). Subgroup analysis for TTP, ORR, DR and OS according to risk factors at baseline are ongoing and will be presented. Conclusion: With longer FU, the combination of 8 cycles of rituximab with CVP chemotherapy continues to provide a major benefit as first line treatment for patients with advanced stage follicular NHL.
