    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5036 Objective: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of bortezomib with dexamethasone for patients with primary systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis or multiple myeloma-associated AL amyloidosis. Methods: Twelve newly diagnosed patients with primary systemic AL amyloidosis and six patient with multiple myeloma-associated AL amyloidosis were treated with a combination of bortezomib (1. 3 mg/m2 d1, 4, 8, 11) and dexamethasone (20 mg d1\u20134). Results: Sixteen patients was evaluable. 12/16 had a hematologic response and 6/16 (37. 5%) a hematologic complete response. Median cycles to response was 1 cycle and median cycles to best response was 2 cycles. In patients with primary AL amyloidosis, 8/10 (80. 0%) had a hematologic response and 5/10 (50. 0%) a hematologic complete response. In patients with myeloma-associated AL amyloidosis, 7/10 (70. 0%) had a hematologic response and 1/6 (16. 7%) a hematologic complete response. Twelve patients (75. 0%) had a response in at least one affected organ, in which 7 in patients with primary AL amyloidosis and 5 in myeloma-associated AL amyloidosis. Person correlation between hematologic response and organ response was 0. 667 ( p =0. 005). Fatigue, diarrhea and infection were the most frequent side effects. Three patients developed herpes zoster and had to stop chemotherapy. Conclusions: VD produces rapid and high hematological responses in the majority of patients with newly diagnosed AL regardless of primary or associated with myeloma. It is well tolerated with few side effects. This treatment may be a valid option as first-line treatment for newly diagnosed patients with primary systemic AL amyloidosis and multiple myeloma-associated AL amyloidosis.
