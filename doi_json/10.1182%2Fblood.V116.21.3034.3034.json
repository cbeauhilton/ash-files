    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3034 Background: The combination of lenalidomide (R), bortezomib (V), and dexamethasone (D) (RVD) in newly diagnosed MM patients is well tolerated and associated with a very high overall response rate. The goal of the current trial is to improve on the CR rate compared with RVD by adding a novel targeted agent. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that vorinostat (Vor), an HDAC inhibitor, is synergistic with bortezomib, immunomodulatory (IMiD\u00ae) compounds and dexamethasone. Clinical studies in the relapsed setting using either bortezomib or lenalidomide with vorinostat have yielded promising results with manageable toxicity. The aim of this study is to determine the tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the combination of RVD with vorinostat in newly diagnosed patients with symptomatic MM. Methods: Patients (Pts) received the current standard RVD regimen (lenalidomide 25 mg days 1\u201314, bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 days 1, 4, 8, 11 and dexamethasone 20/10 mg PO [cycles 1\u20134/5-8] days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12 for up to 8 21 day cycles) combined with oral vorinostat (Vor), provided by Merck and Co. Inc., at 100, 200, 300 or 400 mg daily days 1 \u2013 14 of each cycle. Pts were assigned to one of the four dosing cohorts according to the Bayesian Escalation with Overdose Control (EWOC) algorithm. DLT (\u2265 G3 non hematologic toxicity, G4 hematologic toxicities defined as G4 thrombocytopenia of any duration; failure of recovery of ANC to \u22651,000/\u03bcL or platelets to \u226550,000/\u03bcL within 14 days of the last treatment; or inability to receive Day 1 dose for Cycle 2 due to continued drug-related toxicity from cycle 1) was determined in the first cycle of therapy. Toxicities were assessed and graded for all cycles using the NCI CTCAE v 3.0. Responses were assessed by modified EBMT and Uniform criteria. Pts with PR or better could proceed to autologous transplant after \u2265 4 cycles. Results: Eleven pts (median age 54, 82% men, 54.5% ISS Stage II/III) have been enrolled to date with n=4 pts each in cohorts 1 (Vor 100mg) and 2 (Vor 200mg), and 3 pts in cohort 3 (Vor 300 mg). One patient has completed 8 cycles, 1 pt completed 4 cycles and proceeded to transplant, 6 pts remain on study treatment and 3 pts have discontinued therapy (1 for significant peripheral neuropathy {grade 3}, 1 for patient choice unrelated to toxicity and 1 for non adherence). Two DLTs have occurred: syncope (cohort 1) and asymptomatic grade 3 elevation of ALT (cohort 2) with none in cohort 3.The episode of syncope was not related to cardiac arrhythmia. One study related SAE has occurred (syncope). One other episode of grade 3 elevation of ALT occurred in a pt in cycle 3 in cohort 1. Both episodes of increased ALT resolved and patients remained on study with dose modification. One patient developed grade 3 diarrhea in cohort 1. No patients have developed a grade 4 toxicity. Treatment emergent peripheral neuropathy occurred in 6 patients (4 grade 1, 1 grade 2 and 1 grade 3). No episodes of study related grade 3 fatigue, nausea, or vomiting have occurred. The MTD has not been reached. Eight patients are evaluable for response. All have responded to study therapy with 3 CRs, 1 VGPR and 4 PRs. Three patients went on to stem cell collection after 4 cycles and all collected an adequate dose for transplant of >5 \u00d710 6 CD34+ cells/kg. Conclusion: The combination of RVD with vorinostat has been generally well tolerated to date. No unexpected toxicity has been noted with side effects commensurate with prior experience with each of the drugs and no additive toxicity seen to date. While asymptomatic elevation of ALT has been seen and will require ongoing monitoring, grade 3 ALT elevation was a DLT in the original RVD study and related to dexamethasone, so may not be related to the addition of vorinostat. Early efficacy data is promising with 50% of patients achieving a VGPR or higher. Accrual is ongoing to determine the MTD.
