    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1004 Data from single institutional clinical studies have indicated that the content of CD34+ cells, T-cells, and dendritic cells in a bone marrow allograft are associated with clinical outcomes. The relationship between the cellular constituents of hematopoietic allografts and clinical outcomes was prospectively studied in BMT CTN 0201 in which patients with hematological malignancies (and their donors) were randomized to transplantation with bone marrow or G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (PB) allografts. A secondary objective of this study was to correlate graft characteristics with overall survival (OS). 551 patients were enrolled at 50 North American centers between January 2004 and September 2009 in a BMT CTN-sponsored randomized clinical trial supported by the NHLBI and NCI. Of the 278 subjects randomized to BM, aliquots from 173 BM allografts collected in North America were analyzed at a central laboratory for the content of CD34+ progenitors and immune cell subsets by flow cytometry, and of 151 of these BM transplants had complete clinical data and are the subject of this analysis. The subset of 151 patients were similar to the total group of patients transplanted in BMT CTN 0201, with a median age of 38, and 42% of patients with AML, 26% with ALL, 10% CML, and 21% MDS. 74% of patients had low risk disease, and 47% received 12 Gy TBI and cyclophosphamide with the remainder receiving myeloablative busulfan-based (48%) or fludarabine/melphalan conditioning (5%). GvHD prophylaxis was predominately a calcineurin inhibitor plus methotrexate (91%). 26.5% of patients received grafts from HLA mismatched donors. Clinical outcomes, including OS, acute GVHD III\u2013IV and chronic GVHD, were similar between the subset of patients with analysis of BM cells and the 127 BM recipients without product analysis. 46 progenitor and immune cell subsets were selected for study based upon the absence of a strong correlation with another graft subset (Pearson or Spearman correlation >0.8) and a priori interest or the number of evaluable patients. Graft characteristics were then described separately for survivors and those who died and compared using a nonparametric Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon test. P-values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons, but only covariates for which the q value is <0.2 are presented. The median number of nucleated cells, CD34+ cells, and total T-cells in the allograft were 256, 2.7, and 23 \u00d7 10E6/kg, respectively. The numbers of these donor cells, and the numbers of B-cells, NK cells, and activated T-cells in the BM graft, were not significantly associated with OS. Two of the cell subsets in the BM graft were identified as being significantly associated with transplant outcomes with univariate p-values <0.01 and q values of <0.2: pre-plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) (median number 0.3 \u00d7 10E6/kg; p=0.007), and naive CD8+ T-cells (CD8 N ; median number of 1.3 \u00d7 10E6/kg; p=0.009). Stratifying the entire group of transplant recipients by median values for either pre-pDC or CD8 N showed better overall survival among patients receiving larger numbers of each donor cell subset ( Figure 1 ). Estimated 3 year OS for patients receiving > 0.3 \u00d7 10E6 pre-pDC/kg was 56% versus 35% for recipients of  1.3 \u00d7 10E6 CD8 N /kg versus 37% for recipients of <1.3 \u00d7 10E6 CD8 N /kg (p=0.012, HR for high versus low of 0.52, 95% CI 0.32\u20130.87). Transplantation with more than the median number of CD8 N was also associated with a significantly decreased risk of grade III\u2013IV acute GvHD 0.34 (0.12\u20130.96), p=0.041, but with a higher cumulative incidence of cGVHD at 2 years: 0.55 vs. 0.26, p=0.004. Relapse rates were similar among recipients of larger versus lower numbers of donor pre-pDC and CD8 N . Figure 1.
