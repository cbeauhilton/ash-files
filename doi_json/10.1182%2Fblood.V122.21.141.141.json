    "abstract_text": "Survivin is broadly expressed by hematological malignancies as well as by solid tumors and may be a suitable target for T-cell immunotherapy. Previously, the utility of this target has been challenged by the occurrence of \u201cfratricide\u201d when T cells expressing a high avidity survivin-specific T cell receptor (TCR) killed each other because survivin epitopes can be presented by the T cells themselves (Leisegang M et al, J Clin Invest. 2010 Nov;120(11):3869-77). To overcome this obstacle, we used limiting dilution to isolate a new T-cell clone targeting the HLA-A*02-restricted survivin epitope ELT (survivin 95-104 ) and its variant LML (survivin 96-104 97M) starting from autologous cultures, rather than from the allogeneic cultures previously used for this approach. In 51 Chromium (Cr)-release assays, this T-cell clone, with nanomolar avidity, displayed specific killing against the survivin + HLA-A*02 + leukemia cells BV173 (39\u00b116% specific lysis, E:T 40:1) and multiple myeloma cells U266 (20\u00b17%) but not against HLA-A*02 \u2013 HL-60 cells (2\u00b12%). Furthermore, the colony formation of primary myeloid leukemias was inhibited (>50% reduction) while that of healthy bone marrow (BM) was unaffected. The TCR \u03b1- and \u03b2-chains were then cloned in an optimized retroviral vector that was used to transduce CD8 + T cells which then efficiently expressed the transgenic \u03b1\u03b2TCR (89\u00b14%, n=6). As compared to non-transduced (NT) T cells, survivin-\u03b1\u03b2TCR + T cells produced significant lysis of BV173 (46\u00b114% vs 8\u00b16%, E:T 20:1, n=12, p<0.001) and U266 (27\u00b112% vs 14\u00b16%, p=0.003) but not of HL-60 (14\u00b17 vs 14\u00b16 %, p=NS). Blocking the target cells with specific anti-MHC class I antibodies confirmed the HLA-restriction of TCR transgenic T cells. Importantly, transgenic cells recapitulated the function of the original clone by inhibiting colony formation (range 32-78% reduction, n=5) of primary myeloid leukemias while preserving normal clonogenic capacity of healthy BM or cord blood (n=5). When tested in vivo in a xenograft model of established systemic acute leukemia (FFLuc + BV173) using bioluminescent imaging, leukemia progression was significantly slower in mice treated with survivin-\u03b1\u03b2TCR + versus NT T cells (40x10 6 \u00b1 71x10 6 vs. 128 x 10 6 \u00b1 176 x 10 6 photons/sec by day 28) (p=0.04) and survival improved (n=12/group, p=0.01). This effect was even more pronounced when T cells were transferred to mice with limited leukemia burden (bioluminescent signal by day 40: 8.1 x 10 6 \u00b1 9 x 10 6 vs. 195 x 10 6 \u00b1 85 x 10 6 photons/sec) (p=0.003, n=10/group). Overall survival was improved by day 80 (p<0.001) and 3/10 mice treated with TCR + T cells completely cleared the leukemia. Crucially, the TCR cloned from our autologous culture system produced no fratricidal activity in 51 Cr-release assays against HLA-A*02 + activated T cells (1\u00b12%, E:T 20:1, n=7). Activated T cells were only killed by TCR + T cells when they were also pulsed with survivin peptides (46\u00b112% for LML, 68\u00b114% for ELT, n=7). To elucidate at the molecular level why our \u201cautologous\u201d TCR had selective antitumor activity unlike the fratricidal activity of \u201callogeneic\u201d TCRs (Leisegang M et al, J Clin Invest. 2010 Nov;120(11):3869-77), we modeled the structure of each TCR-peptide-HLA ternary complex using the Rosetta software. While the overall binding energies of TCR-peptide-HLA interfaces for both TCRs were similar, the \u201cautologous\u201d TCR showed a 48% higher binding energy contribution for the peptide as compared to the fratricidal TCR, whose interaction was primarily with the HLA molecule rather than with the survivin peptide in the HLA-binding groove. In conclusion, we have cloned a novel survivin-TCR with a highly epitope-specific binding mode that can be efficiently expressed in polyclonal T cells and provides antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo without affecting the survival of T cells or normal hematopoietic progenitors. Our results indicate that maximal recognition of the peptide presented in the HLA groove is critical for TCR selectivity.
