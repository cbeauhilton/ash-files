    "abstract_text": "Background Several observational studies in patients at high risk of arterial vascular disease have shown that statin use is associated with a decreased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). A recent meta-analysis showed that the odds ratio for a first venous thromboembolic event for statin users was 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78\u20131.01) compared with non-users (Rahmini K, et al. PLoS Med 2012;9: e1001310 doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.1001310). Objective To evaluate the risk of recurrent VTE in patients with VTE treated with an anticoagulant (rivaroxaban or enoxaparin/vitamin K antagonist [VKA]) in relation to the concomitant use of statin therapy in the EINSTEIN-DVT and EINSTEIN-PE studies. Measurements Incidence densities of symptomatic recurrent VTE and major bleeding were expressed per 100 patient-years of exposure (or not) to statins. A Cox proportional hazards model was employed, with statin use as a time-dependent variable, for each treatment group (rivaroxaban vs enoxaparin/VKA) and adjusted for aspirin use, age, body mass index, cardiac disorders, gender, and creatinine clearance at baseline. Results A total of 1509 (18%) of the 8240 patients included in EINSTEIN-DVT and EINSTEIN-PE used statins during the course of the studies. Statin users were more likely to have cardiovascular disorders (31% vs 10%) and also used aspirin more often (26% vs 5%). During statin/rivaroxaban treatment, recurrent VTE occurred with an incidence of 2.0 per 100 patient-years versus 3.6 during non-statin-use (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.29\u20131.32). During statin/enoxaparin/VKA use, recurrent VTE occurred at an incidence of 3.2 per 100 patient-years versus 4.0 during non-statin-use (adjusted HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.47\u20131.69). Major bleeding during statin/rivaroxaban treatment occurred at an incidence of 2.2 per 100 patient-years versus 1.6 during non-statin-use (adjusted HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.43\u20131.98). During statin/enoxaparin/VKA treatment, the rate of major bleeding was 3.7 per 100 patient-years compared with 3.0 during non-statin-use (adjusted HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.36\u20131.32). Due to the adjustments in the Cox regression model the direction of these hazard ratios are in contrast to the crude comparison of rates by patient-years. This is largely because, in general, statin users are older and most of the major bleeding events in statin users occur in the \u226560 years age group. Limitations The study comprised a post-hoc analysis of data collected in two randomized clinical trials. Because the analyses were not a comparison of randomized groups, residual confounding is possible. Conclusions A modest, but not statistically significant, reduction in recurrent VTE was observed with statin use in patients treated for VTE. This reduction was similar in patients receiving enoxaparin/VKA or rivaroxaban therapy. Disclosures: Gebel: Bayer HealthCare AG: Employment, Equity Ownership.
