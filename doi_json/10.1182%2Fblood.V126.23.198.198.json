    "abstract_text": "Introduction. The definitive management of R/R FL remains controversial due to various treatment options, including chemoimmunotherapy, pathway inhibitors, and autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT). These options can provide prolonged progression-free survival (PFS). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) remains the sole curative therapy for FL. Herein, we report the long term outcome of the largest sample of allo-SCT for FL ever studied as well as the identification of patient and disease related factors that were significantly associated with treatment failure. Patients. Eligible were adult patients with R/R FL having received a first allo-SCT between 2001 and 2011 from an HLA identical sibling donor (SIB) or a well-matched unrelated donor (MUD). Patients with transformed lymphoma were excluded from the analysis as well as planned second transplants, allotransplants from cord blood, mismatched donors, and transplants with ex vivo T cell depletion (TCD). Results. 1567 patients met the eligibility criteria (EBMT, n = 1115; CIBMTR, n = 452). Demographics separated by data source demonstrate some differences in transplant practices between the two regions. The CIBMTR cohort had a higher proportion of MUD recipients [167 (37%) vs 252 (23%), p < 0.001], more cases with chemoresistant disease [113 (25%) vs 145 (13%), p < 0.001], less patients having received a prior auto-SCT [53 (12%) vs 403 (36%), p < 0.001], more use of myeloablative conditioning (MAC) (145 (32%) vs 220 (20%), p < 0.001) and less use of alemtuzumab in-vivo TCD [29 (6%) vs 201 (18%), p < 0.001] compared to the EBMT cohort. Median (range) follow up of survivors in months was 58 (3 - 130) and 54 (3 - 160) for CIBMTR and EBMT patients, respectively. Cumulative incidence of acute (grades II-IV) graft versus host disease (GVHD) was 20% (18-22) at 100 days and of chronic GVHD 45% (42-48) and 55% (52-58) at 1 and 3 years, respectively for the whole series; this risk was slightly but significantly reduced in the EBMT cohort. All major outcomes [non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse/progression (R/P), overall survival (OS) and PFS] were comparable between the CIBMTR and EBMT samples (Table 1). Table 1.  Outcomes . CIBMTR .

Of note, outcomes between SIB and MUD were similar (3y OS 68% and 62%, P=0.114). Moreover a significant impact of TCD and prior auto-SCT could not be detected. Conclusions. This study represents an example of a fruitful cooperation between two important scientific transplant societies, the EBMT and CIBMTR. Despite significant differences in patient characteristics and transplant strategies between these 2 hitherto largest samples on allo-SCT for R/R FL, long-term disease control was similar and remarkably good with an R/P risk of about only 20% at 5 years. Chemoresistant disease, higher age, multiple pretreatment lines, poor KPS, and MAC all were predictors for an adverse outcome, whereas MUD, TCD, and prior auto-SCT had no impact on any survival endpoint.
