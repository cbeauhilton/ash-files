    "abstract_text": "The \u03b23 integrins, including \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1V\u03b23, are among the most well studied integrins. \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is specific to platelets and essential for hemostasis and thrombosis. \u03b1V\u03b23 is ubiquitously expressed in many cell types, including platelets and endothelial cells, and is important for cell growth and survival. The \u03b23 subunit contains the headpiece formed by PSI, hybrid, \u03b2I, and I-EGF1 domains, the leg piece formed by the I-EGF 2-4 and \u03b2-tail domains, a transmembrane (TM) domain and a short cytoplasmic tail (CT). Structural studies revealed both \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1V\u03b23 complexes as a bent conformation with the headpiece folded onto the leg piece, representing a resting state. Upon activating by ligand binding to the headpiece or talin/kindlin binding to the CT, \u03b23 integrin undergoes a large conformational rearrangement, showing the headpiece extension from the leg piece and the separation of the leg from the \u03b1 subunit. Only the interface at the headpiece between the \u03b23 \u03b2I and the \u03b1 \u03b2-propeller domains is maintained during the bent to extended transition. The interactions at the \u03b1/\u03b2 TM, CT and leg domains are broken in the active conformation. It remains unknown how the extended state of \u03b23 is triggered and maintained, especially whether the \u03b1 subunit contributes to regulating the \u03b23 conformation. A Leu 33 Pro polymorphism at the \u03b2 3 PSI domain, forming human platelet antigen-1a/1b (HPA-1a/1b), can induce alloantibodies against incompatible HPA-1a during pregnancy or after blood transfusion, leading to two severe bleeding disorders, fetal/neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) and post-transfusion purpura (PTP). The severe risk of FNAIT is intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), often leading to death or life-long neurological disability. The direct cause of ICH remains unknown, but recent studies suggest a strong connection between the ICH and the presence of a subtype of anti-HPA-1a that is specific to the \u03b1V\u03b23 complex on endothelial cells. The other anti-HPA-1a subtypes are \u03b1IIb\u03b23 specific and complex independent. The \u03b1V\u03b23-specific anti-HPA-1a can interfere with endothelial cell function by inhibiting the \u03b1V\u03b23-mediated cell adhesion and angiogenesis, which may be responsible for the development of ICH. Certain anti-HPA-1a antibodies were also found to affect \u03b1IIb\u03b23-mediated platelet function. It is unknown how the anti-HPA-1a antibodies, which bind to the \u03b23 PSI domain, can distinguish the \u03b23 between \u03b1V\u03b23 and \u03b1IIb\u03b23, and how they block \u03b23 integrin function. To address the above questions, we engineered a chimeric \u03b23 integrin (c\u03b23) by replacing the \u03b2I domain with the \u03b1I domain of \u03b1L integrin, enabling to express the full-length \u03b23 as a monomer in the absence of \u03b1 subunit. With this strategy, the conformation of \u03b23 can be studied without \u03b1 subunit. On the cell surface, the c\u03b23 constitutively adopts an extended active conformation, evidenced by the binding of the \u03b1L ligand ICAM-1 in a metal ion-dependent manner, and the binding of active conformation-dependent anti-\u03b23 mAbs. Very surprisingly, the c\u03b23 ectodomain exists in a compact conformation in solution as indicated by size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering. This was confirmed by a high-resolution crystal structure of c\u03b23, which shows a bent shape that is comparable with the \u03b23 conformation in the bent structures of \u03b1V\u03b23 and \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Our c\u03b23 structure revealed a rotational movement at the ankle region connecting the I-EGF4 and the \u03b2-tail domains. Mutagenesis study demonstrated that the plasticity of the ankle region regulates the activation of \u03b23 integrin. These data demonstrate that the \u03b23 integrin can adopt either a bent or extended conformation even without \u03b1 subunit. Our data suggest that the TM, CT, cell membrane, and/or other interacting molecules are responsible for the active form of \u03b23 on the cell surface. We next used our monomeric c\u03b23 to detect the anti-HPA-1a antibodies in FNAIT and PTP, aiming to distinguish the complex-dependent and independent subtypes. Remarkably, we found that anti-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 alloantibodies in FNAIT only recognize the bent conformation of either \u03b1IIb\u03b23 or c\u03b23 but not the extended form. Structural analysis of the PSI domains of the available \u03b23 crystal structures revealed conformational diversity and flexibility, which may account for the heterogeneity of the anti-HPA-1a antibodies. More importantly, the bent conformation specific anti-HPA-1a antibodies may stabilize the resting integrin and block its cellular function. Disclosures Curtis: Ionis Pharmaceuticals: Consultancy.",
