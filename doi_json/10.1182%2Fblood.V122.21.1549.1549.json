    "abstract_text": "Conventional cytogenetic (CC) still remains a mandatory step in the routine diagnostic work-up of every MDS patient (pt), is one of the major determinant of disease outcome and guides potential treatment decisions. However, CC is not informative in about 50% of chromosomally normal (CN) pts and provides limited information in those with very rare defects even if the revised IPSS cytogenetic categories have tried to overcome this drawback. More sensitive techniques (aCGH, SNP-a and NGS), still used in the research setting only, suggest that CN pts may instead contain novel unexpected chromosomal lesions which prognosis is still undefined. Thus, the principal goal of our study was to establish whether FISH with disease specific probes (i.e. for chromosomal regions most commonly affected in MDS) along with non-disease specific probes (i.e. for regions which alteration in MDS has been demonstrated by aCGH only) may effectively unmask clonal cryptic defects. Other aims were to establish the nature of these defects, to identify the potentially targeted genes and to estimate their possible prognostic relevance. The one-hundred twenty-seven consecutive CN MDS pts of the present study came to our observation in the period January 2003-December 2012. They were forty-nine females and seventy-eight males, median age 66 years (range 24-88). Twenty-one pts were diagnosed as RARS, 29 as RA, one as CRMDS, one as U-MDS, 25 as RCMD, 26 as RAEB-1 and 24 as RAEB-2. On CC 122 pts presented a normal karyotype and five no mitotic figures. Considering the revised IPSS score, 62 pts were considered very low-risk, 32 low-risk, 23 intermediate risk, 8 high-risk and 2 very high-risk. Median follow-up was 22 months (range 1-90). At the time of the study nine pts have died. FISH probes were chosen based on the frequency of their involvement in MDS and their Mb position determined using UCSC genome browser on Human Mar. 2003 assembly. They were obtained from BACPAC Resources Center at C.H.O.R.I. (Oakland, USA), labelled and applied as previously described. These probes were: RP11-912D8 (19q13.2); RP11-196P12 (17q11.2); RP11-269C4 (14q12); RP11-351O1 (10q21.3); RP11-144G6 (10q11.2); RP11-122A11 (7q34); RP11-951K18 (5q13.1); RP11-101K5 (4p14); RP11-544H14 (2q33). i-FISH cut-off values were fixed at 10%. Thirty-one pts (24.4%) presented at least a single defect, always represented by deletions or gains of chromosomal material. Among them 8 pts (25.8%) presented at least two defects. Bands most commonly targeted by deletions/amplifications were 19q13.2 (61.3%), 14q12 (32.2%), 17q11.2 (16.1%), 5q13.1 (12.9%), 7q34 (12.9%), 4p14 (9.6%). Deletions of bands 10q11.2, 10q21.3 and 2p33 were more rare. As the RMD-1 gene, involved in DNA double strand breaks and homologous recombination, maps at band 19q13.2, the most commonly deleted chromosomal area, additional molecular tests are being developed to analyse this gene. An abnormal FISH pattern was observed in 2/21 (9.5%) RARS, in 7/29 (24.1%) RA, in 5/25 (20.0%) RCMD, in 8/26 (30.6%) RAEB-1 and in 9/24 (37.5%) RAEB-2. Considering IPSS, an abnormal FISH pattern was revealed in 7/62 (11.3%) very low-risk, in 8/32 (25%) low-risk, in 10/23 (43.4%) intermediate risk, in 5/8 (62.5%) high-risk and in 1/2 very high-risk patients. Disease evolution occurred in a total of 34 pts (3 RARS, 7 RA, 5 CRMD, 11 RAEB-1 and 8 RAEB-2), 16 (one RARS, 3 RA, 2 CRMD, 6 RAEB-1 and 4 RAEB-2) with an abnormal FISH pattern. All the 8 patients with at least two chromosomal deletions experienced disease progression. In conclusion, i) FISH reveals novel unexpected karyotype defects, most commonly deletions pinpointing genes involved in DNA repair, in about 24.4% of CN MDS; ii) band 19q13.2 deletion is the most common defect, frequently associated with disease evolution; ii) an abnormal FISH pattern is correlated with an advanced disease stage and an intermediate/high revised IPSS score; iii) >two lesions are associated with an increased risk of disease progression.
