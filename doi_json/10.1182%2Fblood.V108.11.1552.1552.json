    "abstract_text": "Background and Aim: The role of IV iron supplementation during treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in patients with CIA is of increasing interest as a possible means of improving response. This randomized, open-label, multicenter study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IV iron vs standard practice in CIA patients receiving darbepoetin alfa. Interim efficacy analyses showed a higher response rate for darbepoetin alfa with IV iron compared to darbepoetin alfa with standard iron practice with no difference in the safety profile between the treatment arms (Vanderbroek et al, EHA 2006). Iron parameters are reported here. Methods: Eligible patients were diagnosed with a non-myeloid malignancy and had CIA with a baseline hemoglobin (Hb) value < 11g/dL. All patients received darbepoetin alfa 500 mcg administered Q3W with the SureClick\u2122 prefilled autoinjector. Patients were randomized 1:1 to IV iron 200 mg (single dose Q3W at the same time as darbepoetin alfa or in 2 doses of 100 mg within 3 weeks) or standard practice (oral iron or no iron). Randomization was stratified by tumor type and baseline Hb category (< 10 or \u226510 g/dL). Results: A total of 400 patients were randomized. Mean (SD) age of the study population was 61.4 (11.5) years; range, 20\u201386. Sixty percent (n=241) of participants were women; 28% (n=114) had lung or gynecological tumors; and 52% (n=208) had a baseline Hb value \u226510 g/dL. In the interim analysis population (n=196), the mean (SD) weekly dose of IV iron was 64.8 (6.6) mg in the IV iron group (n=100). In the standard practice group, 28 of 96 patients (29%) received oral iron and 2 (2%) received IV iron (these patients were analyzed as randomized). Mean (standard error) serum ferritin concentrations and percent transferrin saturation (TSAT) in the 2 groups from baseline (BL) to end of study (EOS) are shown in the figure. Conclusions: The combination of darbepoetin alfa Q3W and IV iron appeared to be associated with a trend toward increased mean serum ferritin levels compared to the standard practice control arm. In contrast, mean TSAT surprisingly appeared to be similar in the 2 groups for most of the study period, perhaps suggesting that TSAT is influenced by other factors. Iron management appears to be an important factor in the response to ESAs and the findings presented here suggest the need for additional exploration into iron uptake and demand in cancer patients treated with darbepoetin alfa.
