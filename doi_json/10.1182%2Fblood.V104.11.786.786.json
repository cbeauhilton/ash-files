    "abstract_text": "Waldenstro\u0308m macroglobulinemia (WM) is a lymphoid neoplasm associated with accumulation of lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow and an elevated monoclonal IgM in the serum. Although the genetic and molecular mechanisms behind the pathogenesis of WM are not well understood, losses of the long arm of chromosome 6 have been found as the only recurrent genomic aberration. These deletions, mostly starting at 6q21, are observed in upwards of 50% of patients and involve the majority of the clonal cells. To better characterize pathologic gene expression signatures in different types of WM at the molecular level (6q deleted versus not), we examined gene expression level changes of more than 20000 human gene probes in bone marrow tissues of clinically proven WM patients. We used Affymetrix HG-U133A v2 chips (n = 24). Clonal cells were purified using a combination of anti-CD138 and anti-CD19 Miltenyi \u2122 magnetic microbeads. Based on cIgM-FISH results, we classified samples into two groups - 6q normal (ND) group and 6q deletion (D) group. We then proceeded to identify genes that showed differential expression between the two groups. We selected 165 differentially expressed genes (DEG) using SAM, and underwent further investigation of biological annotations of them using Gene Ontology \u2122 (GO) terms. Among165 DEG, only 32 showed high level of expression in ND group compared to D group while 133 showed high level of expression in D group. As expected, all genes that reside in 6q region showed under-expression in D group, constituting 53% (17 genes) of genes under-expressed in D group (32 genes). According to GO analysis, the 6q-deletion-induced under-expression affects many biological processes, and is associated with a transcriptional upregulation of downstream genetic cascades. This likely indicates release of regulatory control by a tumor suppressor gene. Genes involved in cell growth and maintenance, cell communication and morphogenesis are also over-expressed in D group. Interestingly, a gene that is involved in innate immune response and inflammatory response shows under-expression in D group but is not accounted for by other mechanisms. In similar vein, a gene that is involved in negative regulation of cytokine biosynthesis showed over-expression in D group. We think these transcriptional characteristics can provide basic framework for differentiating subtypes of WM and search for genes associated with WM pathogenesis",
