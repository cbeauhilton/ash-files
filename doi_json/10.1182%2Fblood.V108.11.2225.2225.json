    "abstract_text": "All- trans -retinoic acid (ATRA) and the gene encoding retinoic acid receptor-\u03b1 (RAR\u03b1) have been implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Nevertheless, the role of these molecules in the pathogenesis and therapy of non-APL acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) remains unclear. Previously we have shown that expression of the ATRA-inducible RAR\u03b12 isoform is downregulated in a variety of AML cell lines and increases with hematopoietic differentiation along the myelomonocytic lineage. Using quantitative real-time PCR we have now investigated expression of the RAR \u03b1 gene in primary AML cells (n=23) and report that as in AML cell lines the levels of RAR\u03b12 mRNAs are markedly reduced (by 48 fold in APL, p\u22640.05, and by 52 fold in non-APL AML, p\u22640.01) relative to cord blood (CB) derived CD33 (or CD34) positive cell population (n=4). However, in contrast to the AML cell lines and normal hematopoietic progenitors, the expression of the RAR\u03b11 isoform was also significantly reduced in primary AML samples (up to 26 fold, p\u22640.05). Examination of potential mechanisms underlying the silencing of the RAR \u03b1 gene expression in AML revealed that the RAR \u03b1 2 promoter possesses two small CpG islands that are fully methylated in all AML cell lines examined. Consistent with the expression pattern of RAR\u03b11 a single CpG island in the RAR\u03b11 promoter region was unmethylated in all these samples. As expected from such results expression of RAR\u03b12, but not RAR\u03b11, could be stimulated with a DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2\u2032deoxycytidine and synergistic effects between 5-aza-2\u2032deoxycytidine and ATRA were observed on both RAR\u03b12 expression and cellular differentiation of APL and non-APL AML cell lines. Extending this analysis to clinical material we have surprisingly discovered that RAR\u03b11 and RAR\u03b12 CpG islands are unmethylated in all AML patient samples, including 3 APL cases, suggesting that DNA methylation may not play a significant role in silencing of the RAR \u03b1 gene expression in primary AML cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of the RAR\u03b12 regulatory region with antibodies to specific histone modifications revealed presence of other negatively acting chromatin states in primary AML samples (relative to normal CD33 positive CB cells), including decreased histone H3 acetylation as well as decreased di- and tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 4. A possibility that microRNAs targeting sequences in the common 3\u2032-UTR regions of the RAR\u03b11 and \u03b12 isoforms may also contribute to silencing of both RAR\u03b11 and \u03b12 expression in AML cannot be excluded. These results underscore the complexities of mechanisms that are responsible for silencing of gene expression in AML and support the notion that diminished RAR \u03b1 expression contributes to leukemogenesis.",
