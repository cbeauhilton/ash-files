    "abstract_text": "Factor XI (FXI), a coagulation protein essential for normal hemostasis, is a homodimer consisting of two identical subunits of 80 KDa linked by a disulfide bond formed by Cys321 within the Apple 4 (A4) domain of each subunit. Prekallikrein (PK), in spite of its high homology with FXI both in amino acid sequence and domain structure, is a monomer. Cys321 in PK forms an intrachain disulfide bond with Cys326. However FXI/C321S (in which interchain disulfide bond formation is precluded) is a noncovalent dimer. Thus, there are interacting residues between the two subunits of FXI that are responsible for mediating its unique homodimeric structure. Examination of the crystal structure of FXI ( Papagrigoriou E, McEwan P, Walsh PN, Emsley J. Nature Structural & Molecular Biology . 2006 ; 13 : 557 \u20138 ) shows salt bridges between Lys331 of one subunit with Glu287 of the other subunit as well as hydrophobic interactions at the interface of the A4 domains involving Ile290, Leu284 and Tyr329. FXI/C321S, FXI/C321S/K331A, FXI/C321S/E287A, FXI/C321S/I290A, FXI/C321S/Y329A, FXI/C321S/L284A and FXI/C321S/K331R were expressed in HEK293 cells and characterized using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), and functional assays. Whereas FXI/C321S existed in a monomer/dimer equilibrium (Kd \u223c40 nM) all other mutants were predominantly monomers by SEC with impaired dimer formation by AUC (Kd 3.4\u201338 \u03bcM). All the monomeric mutants when converted to the active enzyme, FXIa, were able to hydrolyze the small chromogenic substrate S-2366 with normal values of Km and Vmax and cleaved the macromolecular substrate FIX at both its scissile bonds at rates similar to those observed with wtFXIa strongly suggesting that all mutant proteins were properly folded. However all the monomeric mutants displayed impaired clotting activity in an APTT assay and displayed markedly decreased rates of activation by FXIIa or thrombin and autoactivation in the presence or absence of dextran sulfate. We conclude that salt bridges formed between Lys331 of one subunit and Glu287 of the other together with hydrophobic interactions of residues Ile290 with Leu284 and Tyr329 with Tyr329 and are essential for normal homodimer formation, which is essential for normal proteolytic activation of FXI by FXIIa, thrombin and FXIa either in solution or on an anionic surface."
