    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4538 Introduction International reassessments of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) for anemia have recently occurred. While ESAs prevent blood transfusions and, improve select quality of life domains among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, 8 trials individually identified increased mortality and/or tumor progression among cancer patients treated with ESAs. For CKD, one study of non-dialysis CKD patients targeted to higher versus lower hemoglobin (Hb) levels identified 34% increased relative risk (17.5% vs. 13.5%) for death, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure hospitalization, or stroke with a higher Hb target. Methods Guidelines, notifications from regulatory agencies and manufacturers, reimbursement policies, and utilization for ESAs in the cancer and CKD settings within the U.S., Europe, and Canada were reviewed. Results: Cancer Setting In 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) restricted ESAs from cancer patients seeking cure. Reimbursement is limited to Hb levels < 10 g/dL. In the U.S., ESA usage increased 340% between 2001 and 2006, and decreased 60% since 2007. The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) reports that ESA benefits do not outweigh risks. In Europe, ESA reimbursement is included in global provider payments. Between 2001 and 2006, ESA use increased 51%; since 2006, use has decreased 10%. Canadian manufacturers recommend ESA usage based on patient preference. In Canada, reimbursement for myelosuppressive chemotherapy with ESAs is restricted to Hb levels of 10-11 g/dL in Alberta and 11-12.5 g/dL in British Columbia. Usage increased 20% between 2004 and 2007. CKD Setting The FDA recommends Hb levels < 12 g/dL and Medicare reimbursement is restricted to Hb levels \u2265 13 g/dL. Between 2001 and 2006, usage increased 480% (non-dialysis) and 40% (dialysis) in the U.S. Since 2007, ESA use has decreased 30% (non-dialysis) and 17% (dialysis). The EMEA recommends target Hb levels of 10-12 g/dL. In Europe, ESA usage has increased 10% since 2001. The 2009 Canadian label recommends Hb levels < 12 g/dL. Within Canada, ESA usage increased 30% since 2004. Conclusions While reassessments of ESA safety have occurred internationally, safety concerns in the U.S. have resulted in marked decrements in ESA use among cancer and CKD patients, whereas in Europe and Canada ESA use has increased over time.
