    "abstract_text": "Background Idelalisib (IDELA) is a first-in-class, selective, oral inhibitor of PI3K\u03b4 that reduces proliferation, enhances apoptosis, and inhibits homing and retention of malignant B cells in lymphoid tissues. Phase 1 trials demonstrated that IDELA is highly active as a single agent or in combination with rituximab (R) in heavily pretreated patients (pts) with CLL. Pts in these trials experienced reductions in disease-associated chemokines, improvement of organomegaly and cytopenias, profound reductions in lymphadenopathy, and durable clinical benefit with an acceptable safety profile (Brown 2013; Barrientos 2013). Patients with early progression and significant co-morbidities have limited treatment options; single-agent rituximab is an option in these pts (NCCN 2013; Zelenetz 2013). Methods This Phase 3 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of IDELA + R vs placebo + R in pts with previously treated CLL. Eligibility criteria included the need for treatment per IWCLL guidelines, measurable lymphadenopathy, and CLL progression  6), renal dysfunction, or cytopenias due to poor marrow reserve. All pts received R at 375 mg/m 2 [1st dose] and then 500 mg/m 2 q2 wks x 4, followed by q4 wks x 3 [8 doses total]) and were randomized to Arm A (n=110; IDELA 150 mg BID continuously) or Arm B (n=110; placebo BID continuously). Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Response and progression in both arms were assessed by an independent review committee using standard criteria (Hallek 2008; Cheson 2012). Results were reviewed by an external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). Results Results are from a pre-specified interim analysis after \u223c50% of the total number of 119 planned events of CLL progression or death from any cause. Data cutoff was 30 Aug 2013. Pt characteristics (n=220) included a median age of 71 yrs (78% \u2265 65 yrs); CIRS > 6 in 85%; median creatinine clearance of 63.6 mL/min; and presence of anemia (73%), thrombocytopenia (61%), neutropenia (34%). Median time since diagnosis was 8.5 yrs, median number of prior therapies was 3 (range: 1-12), 44% had del(17p)/TP53 mutation, and 84% had unmutated IGHV . PFS in the IDELA + R arm was superior to placebo +R (HR [95% CI] = 0.15 [0.08, 0.28]; p = 3.0 x 10 11 ). Median PFS of pts treated with IDELA + R was not reached and for placebo + R was 5.5 mos. At 24 wks, the PFS rate for IDELA +R was 93% compared to 46% for placebo + R. PFS strongly favored IDELA + R in all subgroups, including those with del(17p)/TP53 or unmutated IGHV . Pts treated with IDELA + R and with \u22651 post-baseline assessment also had a superior overall response rate (ORR) relative to those in the control arm (81% vs. 13%; odds ratio 29.9; p = 3.0 x 10 19 ) and a higher lymph node response (LNR) rate (93% vs. 4%; odds ratio 264.5; p = 1.3 x 10 -30 ). Relative to the control group, pts treated with IDELA +R also had a significant improvement in overall survival (OS): HR (95% CI) = 0.28 (0.09, 0.86), p = 0.018. Adverse events (AEs) occurring in \u226520% of pts (any Gr/Gr \u22653) by arm were: pyrexia (IDELA + R 29%/3%; placebo + R 16%/1%), fatigue (IDELA + R 24%/3%; placebo + R 27%/2%), nausea (IDELA + R 24%/0%; placebo + R 22%/0%), chills (IDELA + R 22%/2%; placebo + R 16%/0%), infusion-related reactions (IDELA + R 16%/0%; placebo + R 28%/4%), and cough (IDELA + R 15%/0%; placebo + R 25%/2%). Other selected AEs (any Gr/Gr \u22653) included diarrhea (IDELA + R 19%/4%; placebo + R 14%/0%) and rash (IDELA + R 10%/2%; placebo + R 6%/0%). Select lab abnormalities (any Gr/Gr \u22653) included ALT elevation (IDELA + R 31%/6%; placebo + R 9%/1%), anemia (IDELA + R 26%/6%; placebo + R 30%/14%), neutropenia (IDELA + R 55%/34%; placebo + R 49%/22%), and thrombocytopenia (IDELA + R 17%/10%; placebo + R 26%/16%). The most common SAEs were pneumonia (6.4%), pyrexia (6.4%), and febrile neutropenia (4.5%) in IDELA + R, and pneumonia (8.4%), febrile neutropenia (5.6%), and dyspnea (3.7%) in placebo + R. AEs led to study drug discontinuation in 9 pts (8.2%) in IDELA + R and 11 pts (10.3%) in placebo + R. Based on a review of efficacy and safety, the DMC recommended stopping the study early. Conclusions IDELA + R demonstrated statistically significant improvement with acceptable safety over placebo + R in PFS, ORR, LNR and OS in heavily pretreated pts with relapsed CLL, including those with adverse genetic features.
