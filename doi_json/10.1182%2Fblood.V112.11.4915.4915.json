    "abstract_text": "Patients with Gaucher disease exhibit substantial evidence of impairment of their immune system, namely, increased serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines and immunoglobulins, and increased incidence of B-cell malignancies, such as non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, MGUS and multiple myeloma. We investigated peripheral blood T-lymphocyte subpopulations with dual color flow cytometry, as well as the direction of T-lymphocyte activation, by using intracytoplasmic immunostaining for IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-gamma, on resting CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes and following activation with PMA- 1 with the presence of Brefeldin-A. Evaluations were performed on 16 patients with type I Gaucher disease and on 17 healthy controls. Patients had significantly decreased absolute lymphocyte count (1621\u00b1684 vs 2148\u00b1566/mm 3 , p=0.013), CD3+ (1197\u00b1478 vs 1508\u00b1431/mm 3 , p=0.045) and CD4+ T-lymphocytes (658\u00b1245 vs 945\u00b1253/mm 3 , p=0.021), but not CD8+ T-lymphocytes (491\u00b1331 vs 486\u00b1189/mm 3 , p: n.s.), resulting in a significant reduction of the CD4/CD8 ratio (1.59\u00b10.68 vs 2.16\u00b10.83, p=0.041). The populations of naive CD4+CD45RA+ and of memory CD4+CD45RO+ T-lymphocytes were also significantly decreased (218\u00b1128 vs 432\u00b1179/mm 3 , p=0.0005 and 484\u00b1185 vs 631\u00b1231/mm 3 , p=0.056 respectively), however, CD8+CD45RA+ and CD8+CD45RO+ subpopulations did nor differ significantly, when compared to controls. CD3\u2212CD56+, but not CD3+CD56+ lymphocytes were also decreased (131\u00b182 vs 199\u00b197/mm 3 , p=0.037). Patients had higher percentages of CD8+ (29.2\u00b19.7 vs 23.5\u00b16.8%, p=0.042), CD8+CD45RA+ (22.1\u00b16.2 vs 18.3\u00b15.0%, p=0.046) and CD8+CD45RO+ T-lymphocytes (13.2\u00b16.2 vs 9.6\u00b13.7%, p=0.027), as well as of activated CD8+HLA-DR+ (0.93\u00b10.68 vs 0.48\u00b10.21%, p=0.008) and CD4+HLA-DR+ T-lymphocytes (1.77\u00b10.93 vs 1.09\u00b10.48%, p=0.008). Moreover, although both, the absolute number and the percentage of CD20+ B-lymphocytes were similar, patients exhibited significantly increased absolute number and percentage of CD5+CD20+ B-lymphocytes (1.63\u00b10.55 vs 0.64\u00b10.37% p=0.00002 and 29\u00b120 vs 13\u00b18/mm 3 , p=0.011, respectively). Finally, patients with Gaucher disease had significantly increased resting TH2-polarized CD4+T-lymphocytes (CD4+IL-10+: 0.41\u00b10.29 vs 0.24\u00b10.11%, p=0.045) and TH1-polarized CD8+ T-lymphocytes (CD8+IFN\u03b3+: 0.15\u00b10.07 vs 0.08\u00b10.04%, p=0.005, CD8+IL10+: 0.22\u00b10.08 vs 0.32\u00b10.014, p=0.052, and IFN\u03b3+/IL4+ ratio among the CD8+ population 2.54\u00b12.1 vs 1.08\u00b10.91, p=0.018). Following mitogenic activation a very significant impairment of obtaining the TH1 phenotype was observed (CD4+IL2+ lymphocytes 33.7\u00b117.1 vs 65.4\u00b16.1%, p<0.00001). The above findings suggest that in patients with Gaucher disease there is a significant numerical impairment of T-helper lymphocytes and a shift towards TH-2 direction of lymphocyte activation. These findings may explain the rarity of autoimmune manifestations despite the chronic inflammatory reaction, as well as the increased incidence of lymphoid malignancies, which has been reported among patients suffering from this disease.",
