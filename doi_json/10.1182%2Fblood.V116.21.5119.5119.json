    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5119 Introduction: It has been previously reported that both short and long term vascular and thromboembolic events (TEE) occur following cisplatin containing chemotherapy for germ-cell cancer (GCC) (Bokemeyer et al. 1998, Weijl et al. 2000, Diekmann et al. 2010). It has also been shown that patients with GCC are at higher risk of TEE than patients with non-GCC, while on cisplatin-based chemotherapy (Piketty et al. 2005). Method: We reviewed all GCC patients treated in our department from 2008 until 2010 with cisplatin-based chemotherapy and assessed the incidence of TEE. Cases were analyzed with respect to risk factors for vascular events (obesity, diabetes, nicotine abuse, prior cardiovascular disease, prior TEE), tumor characteristics (low- vs. intermediate/high-risk GCC) and age. In addition, further analysis of hemostasis laboratory tests of these patients is being performed. Result: Eight patients (8/50=16%) treated with cisplatin-containing chemotherapy developed TEE. Of these TEE, two were myocardial infarctions, four pulmonary embolisms, one patient showed thrombosis of the jugular vein and one a peripheral (femoral) arterial thrombosis. TE-risk factors included: nicotine abuse in two patients, obesity and nicotine abuse in one patient and no identifiable factors in the others (hemostasis laboratory tests are currently being performed). The median age of these 8 patients was 42 years (range 16\u201361). Patients were treated with PEB (cisplatin, etoposide, bleomycin) or PIV (cisplatin, ifosfamide, etoposide) initially applying continuous heparin prophylaxis with 15000IE/day (d), d1-5 only during PEB or PIV, but no low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH-) and/or aspirin (ASS-) medication for venous and arterial TEE prophylaxis thereafter. With these clinically very relevant and severe TEEs, we have adapted our PEB- and PIV protocols, adding a LMWH prophylaxis (enoxaparin 40mg d6-21 after chemotherapy). Conclusion: We observed an increased risk of major thromboembolic and vascular events with an incidence rate of 16% in GCC patients after cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. Prior studies have identified TEE-risks in GCC and with cisplatin-chemotherapy, albeit LMWH- and/or ASS-prophylaxis - without clinical trials - has not been recommended as yet. Prospective studies investigating thrombosis prophylaxis measures are currently performed in order to achieve the best standard of care for these patients. Currently an extensive hemostasis diagnostic testing from all patients with TEE is being performed. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
