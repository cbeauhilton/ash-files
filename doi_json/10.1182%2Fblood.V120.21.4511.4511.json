    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4511 Introduction: The outcome for patients with primary refractory or refractory relapse of acute leukaemia, particularly those with disease present at the time of transplant, remains very poor even using full intensity conditioning schedules. With the aim of improving outcome, we have employed the use of pre-conditioning chemotherapy prior to the delivery of both reduced toxicity (RTC) and full intensity transplants during the subsequent period of cytopenia. Initial results indicate feasibility and efficacy in this poor risk disease. The bi-halogen purine analogue Clofarabine has significant activity as a single agent for the treatment of ALL and AML and is well tolerated, characteristics suggesting Clofarabine is an ideal agent to use in pre-conditioning. Patients and methods: We have treated 11 patients with high-risk, refractory acute leukaemia or advanced myelodysplasia (MDS) using Clofarabine pre-conditioning to reduce disease burden before full intensity or RTC allogeneic transplantation. Patient characteristics for the two groups are shown below ( Table 1 ). Table 1  Median age (range) . Sex (%) . Underlying disease (%) . M . F . Primary refractory AML . Refractory Relapse of AML .

Indications for using Clofarabine included severe allergy to Cytarabine, heavy prior exposure to anthracycline or lack of response to other salvage agents. 10 of 11 patients had significant marrow involvement prior to administration of Clofarabine. Results: In this cohort we have not seen additional unexpected complications. One patient who received a RTC regimen, was treated for VOD on clinical suspicion but liver biopsy indicated grade 3\u20134 haemosiderosis only. Two patients who received TBI-based transplants suffered grade 3\u20134 mucositis. The extended period of pancytopenia compared with conventional transplant schedules was manageable, with no unexpected infectious complications. The median time to a neutrophil count of > 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /l was 18 days post stem cell infusion (range 12\u201333 days) and to a platelet count > 20 \u00d7 10 9 /l was 13 days (range 11\u201332 days). All patients achieved \u2265 98% donor chimerism by day +30. 2 of 11 patients (18%) experienced grade 3\u20134 acute GvHD (1 cutaneous, 1 gut) which responded to additional immunosuppression. 9 of 10 patients with disease present at the time of Clofarabine achieved substantial bulk reduction or eradication of marrow leukaemic blasts following the Clofarabine. 5 of 11 patients died from disease relapse post allograft at 2\u201313 months post transplant, including the patient with Clofarabine-refractory disease. 6 patients are currently in CR at 1\u201377 months follow up. Overall survival for the 11 patients, using Kaplan-Meier analysis, is 48% with a median follow up of survivors of 26 months (range 1\u201377), shown below in figure 1 : Figure 1 View large Download slide Figure 1 View large Download slide  Conclusions: The use of Clofarabine as a pre-conditioning agent prior to the administration of the transplant conditioning schedule is well tolerated with both full intensity and reduced toxicity protocols. This approach to allogeneic transplantation shows promise for the therapy of patients with high risk refractory acute leukaemia.
