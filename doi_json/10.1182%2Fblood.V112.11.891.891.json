    "abstract_text": "CD9 is a four transmembrane protein belonging to a tetraspanin family and regulates cell motility and adhesion. Several reports have indicated that CD9 form complexes with integrin including platelet fibrinogen receptor integrin aIIb-b III and involve in platelet function. We have previously reported that the c-myb knock down (KD) mice exhibited anemia and thrombocytopenia, and the expression level of CD9 mRNA was markdly increased in the c-myb KD mice. Reverse correlation of c-Myb expression with the CD9 gene expression was verified and agonistic antibody of CD9 stimulated megakaryocytic colony formation. These observations suggested that the CD9 expression was downregulated by c-myb . In our current study, we investigated the role of CD9 during megakaryopoiesis and platelet function by using CD9-null mice. Numbers of megakaryocytes and platelets, CFU-Meg, and ploidy were not different between wild-type and CD9-null mice. However, proplatelet formation (PPF) was significantly impaired in CD9-null megakaryocytes, and the size of proplatelets was smaller than those generated by wild-type megakaryocytes. Furthermore, after the bone marrow suppression with 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu), the recovery phase of platelet counts were delayed in the CD9-null mice. To clarify the reason of this platelet- recover delay, the number of bone marrow megakaryocyte was investigated using anti-vWF antibody staining, but the serial measurement of megakaryocyte number in CD9-null mice was not changed compared with wild-type mice. And also megakaryocyte ploidy was not changed in CD9-null mice compared with wild-type mice. Previous reports revealed that the cytoskeleton reorganization has a key role for the PPF formation, and Rac1-PAK1 signaling is important for actin restructure and aggregation prior to the cytoskeleton reorganization. The PPF formation was suppressed by Rac1 inhibitor. Although the mRNA expression levels of Rac1 in CD9-null mice were almost same as that in wild-type mice, PAK1 activation, major target of Rac1, was delayed in CD9-null mice compared with wild-type mice using thrombin-stimulating platelets. These results suggested that the delay of PAK1 activation cause the suppression of PPF formation in CD9-null mice. Our previous and current studies demonstrate that c-Myb suppresses the CD9 expression in a steady-state condition, while in the stress megakaryocytosis, CD9 is upregulated and acts to induce megakaryopoiesis and platelets production through Rac1-PAK1 signaling pathway. Elucidation of c-Myb-CD9 regulatory function seems to be important to understand the stress megakaryopoiesis.",
