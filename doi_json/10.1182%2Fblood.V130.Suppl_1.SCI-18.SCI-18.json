    "abstract_text": "Thirty percent of Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) cases result from haploinsufficiency of ribosomal protein S19 and ~40% from haploinsufficiencies of 15 other ribosomal proteins. The macrocytic anemia of myelodysplasia with deletion of chromosome 5q (del(5q)MDS), which results from the acquisition of RPS14 haploinsufficiency, has a similar clinical phenotype. Although these mutations disrupt ribosome assembly and impair protein translation, how this causes macrocytic anemia remains uncertain and controversial. Since 95% of the protein content of red cells is globin, we hypothesized that any germline or somatic mutation that slows protein synthesis would impair globin production relative to heme production. This is because the synthesis of heme, a chemical chelate, depends on only small amounts of protein (enzymes) and the rate limiting enzyme, ALAS2, is an early GATA1 target. Studies of marrow cells from patients with DBA and del(5q) MDS show that heme synthesis indeed progresses normally, while globin synthesis is delayed. This results in excess heme in CFU-E/proerythroblasts, excessive ROS and cell death ( Sci Transl Med 8:338RA67, 2016). Similar results are seen in a murine model of heme excess ( Flvcr1 -deletion) ( J Clin Invest 125:4681, 2015) and murine models of DBA. As slowing heme synthesis improves the coordination of heme and globin and improves red cell production, a phase 2 study is underway (PI Bart Scott) to determine the efficacy of aggressive iron chelation to slow heme synthesis in patients with very low to intermediate risk MDS and anemia. More recently, we have quantitated the cell surface expression of CD71, CD44 and Ter119 on individual murine erythroid cells from normal, Flvcr1 -deleted mice with macrocytic anemia, and erythropoietin-treated mice. We then barcoded and assessed the cell's total transcriptome. By linking these datasets, we uncovered a GATA1-heme autoregulatory loop which regulates normal erythropoiesis and contributes to the failed erythropoiesis of ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency. We show that heme normally upregulates ribosome protein transcription in early erythroid cells. Thus, in addition to increasing globin transcription and translation (via Bach1 and HRI), heme assures adequate ribosomes for globin synthesis. In later erythroid cells, heme decreases GATA1, GATA1 target genes and mitotic spindle gene expression, assuring that red cell differentiation appropriately terminates and cell division ceases. In human marrow CD36+GlyA- or CD36+GlyA+ cells, these changes occur within 15 minutes of inducing endogenous heme synthesis with ALA (bypasses ALAS2) and iron. As excess heme would increase ROS, increase ribosomal protein imbalance to intensify P53 expression, prematurely lower GATA1, and impede mitosis, our data explain the ineffective (early termination of) erythropoiesis in DBA and del(5q) MDS, help explain why these anemias are macrocytic, and reconcile the disparate observations of others.
