    "abstract_text": "Platelets contain a high concentration of transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21). Platelet TGF\u03b21 has been shown to contribute to plasma TGF\u03b21 levels and resultant cardiac fibrosis and systolic dysfunction in a murine pressure overload model. TGF\u03b21 has also been reported to be involved in the development of liver fibrosis, but the cellular source of TGF\u03b21 was not known. In this study, we tested whether platelet TGF\u03b21 contributes to liver fibrosis by comparing three groups of mice: 1) mice with platelet-specific deletion of TGF\u03b21 (PF4Cre/Tgfb1 flox/flox ), 2) littermate control Tgfb1 flox/flox , and 3) WT C57Bl/6 mice. Mice were injected with CCl 4 (1ml/kgBW) with peanut oil (1:100) i.p. 2 times a week for 6 weeks. CCl 4 -induced liver injury was evaluated by in situ hybridization of two liver-specific genes, albumin and Cyp2e, which are expressed in periportal and pericentral areas of the liver, respectively. Liver fibrosis was quantified by slide stitching picrosirius red stained whole liver sections under polarized light. Total collagen content in liver homogenate was evaluated by hydroxyproline assay. Blood was collected before and after CCl 4 injections by retrobulbar puncture method into tubes containing 0.1 vol of 3.8% Na-citrate containing10\u00b5M PGE 1 to minimize platelet activation in vitro. TGF\u03b21 levels in plasma were measured by ELISA. PF4Cre/Tgfb1 flox/flox mice had > 90% lower levels of total TGF\u03b21 in their platelets and ~50% lower plasma TGF\u03b21 levels than WT or littermate control mice, (TGF\u03b21 levels in 10 9 platelets/ml were 73 \u00b1 10 ng in WT and 4.0 \u00b1 1.0 ng in PF4CreTgfb1 flox/flox mice, p<0.0001; and in plasma 2.5 \u00b1 0.7 ng/ml in WT and 1.3 \u00b1 0.2 ng/ml in PF4CreTgfb1 flox/flox ; p<0.001). Plasma TGF\u03b21 levels increased 24 hours after CCl 4 injection in WT (3 ng/ml before and 6 ng/ml after CCl 4 injection), but not in PF4Cre/Tgfb1 flox/flox mice (1.2 ng/ml before and 1.5 ng/ml after CCl 4 injection). In situ hybridization showed high expression of Cyp2e gene primarily in the pericentral vein area where damage occurred within 3 days after the first CCl 4 injection. However, albumin gene expression was normal in all non-damaged periportal areas. Liver fibrosis was ~ 20% less in PF4Cre/Tgfb1 flox/flox mice (n=11) compared to WT (n=14), or littermate control mice as quantified by both picrosirius red staining and hydroxyproline assays (picrosirius staining area fraction was 2.6 \u00b1 0.4 % in PF4Cre/Tgfb1 flox/flox , 3.2 \u00b1 0.6 % in WT, and 3 \u00b1 0.4 % in littermate controls; p=0.004 between WT and PF4Cre and P=0.07 for littermate control vs. PF4Cre). There was a lower trend in total collagen content in PF4CreTgfb1 flox/flox mice compared to combined controls mice (collegen in PF4Cre/Tgfb1 flox/flox was 0.8 \u00b1 0.1 ng/ml and 1.6 \u00b1 1 ng/ml in controls (p=0.07). Staining platelets in frozen sections of liver after 1 day of CCl 4 injection with anti-CD41 (eBioscience) showed platelet accumulation in the damaged area of the liver, so we created a transient thrombocytopenia in WT mice by injecting a single dose of anti-GP1b\u03b1 (2.5 mg/kg) antibody (R300, Emfret), which caused an 80% decrease in platelet count within 24 hours, and we found a 20% reduction in fibrosis in the CCl 4 treated thrombocytopenic mice compared to isotype-matched antibody-injected mice (p=0.02). Because myofibroblast accumulation is a hallmark of tissue fibrosis, we quantified this in the damaged area by counting aSMA and vimentin double-stained cells and found reduced myofibroblast accumulation in PF4Cre/Tgfb1 flox/flox mice vs. WT or littermate control mice. Evidence of active TGF\u03b21 signaling was detected as transient loss of phosphoSmad2 signaling in damaged tissue after 1 day of CCl 4 challenge, but intensity increased as the liver tissue began to repair after 3 days. PhosphoSmad2 signaling intensity was 20% less in PF4Cre/Tgfb1 flox/flox mice compared to WT mice after 3 days. Liver function was evaluated by measuring plasma levels of albumin and globin and we found that albumin to globin ratio was decreased in WT mice, but not in PF4Cre/Tgfb1 flox/flox mice after 3 days of CCl 4 injection. We conclude that platelet-derived TGF\u03b21 contributes at least partially to the development of liver fibrosis and the deterioration of liver function in the CCl 4 -induced liver injury model. These data have important implications for understanding TGF\u03b21 biology in various tissue injuries and in assessing the role of TGF\u03b21 in murine models of human diseases.
