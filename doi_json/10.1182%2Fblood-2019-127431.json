    "abstract_text": "Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and the CXCR4 chemokine receptor antagonist Plerixafor are used to mobilize hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC). However, in the autologous setting, prior chemotherapy and radiotherapy impair HSPC mobilizing response to G-CSF and Plerixafor thereby precluding autologous HSC transplantation. We now demonstrate in mice that oncostatin M (OSM) production in the bone marrow (BM) is dramatically increased in response to G-CSF and that OSM counteracts the mobilizing effect of G-CSF and Plerixafor indirectly through the BM stroma. Indeed, by immunohistochemistry, a 4-day G-CSF treatment strongly increased OSM protein expression in cell clusters containing F4/80+ macrophages in the endosteal and central region of the mobilized BM. OSM concentration was 7-fold higher in BM fluids of G-CSF mobilized mice compared to control mice as measured by ELISA. To investigate OSM effects on HSPC mobilization, C57BL/6 mice (WT) and mice lacking the OSM receptor gene (OSMR-/-) were treated with 125 \u03bcg/kg human G-CSF bidaily for 2-6 days and/or Plerixafor (10 mg/kg) one hour before harvest. Absence of OSMR increased HSPC mobilization with a 4-fold increase in colony forming cells (CFC), phenotypic Lin-Kit+Sca1+ HSPC (LKS+ cells) and LKS+Flt3-CD48-CD150+ HSC into the blood at days 2 and 4 of G-CSF treatment and increased accumulation of HSPC and HSC in the spleen of OSMR-/- mice at day 6 of G-CSF treatment. In a competitive repopulation assay with serial dilutions of mobilized blood, deletion of OSMR gene enhanced \u22484-fold mobilization of functional reconstituting HSC in response to G-CSF as shown by Poisson's distribution analysis. HSPC mobilization in response to Plerixafor was also significantly enhanced with a doubling of CFC, HSPC and HSC into the blood of OSMR-/- mice compared to WT. OSMR gene deletion also significantly enhanced HSPC mobilization (3-fold) in response to G-CSF plus Plerixafor combination, the most effective mobilization regimen currently approved. To further demonstrate that endogenous OSM restrains HSPC mobilization in response to G-CSF, we produced a recombinant mouse OSM-trap, a dimeric protein chimera made of the extracellular domain of mouse OSMR and mouse gp130 fused with a mutant Fc fragment of mouse IgG2a. Co-administration of this OSM-trap together with G-CSF also increased HSPC and HSC mobilization into the blood in response to G-CSF compared to mice treated with G-CSF and control trap construct. This negative effect of endogenous OSM on HSPC mobilization was indirectly mediated by BM stromal cells. qRT-PCR on BM myeloid and stromal cells sorted from steady-state or mobilized mice showed that Osm mRNA is mostly expressed by CD11b+F4/80+CD169+VCAM1+ macrophages and CD11b+F4/80-Ly6G+ neutrophils. In sharp contrast, Osmr mRNA was undetectable in any sorted BM leukocyte population, but abundantly expressed by CD45-Lin-CD31+Sca1+CD105+ endothelial and CD45-Lin-CD31-CD51+PDGFR\u03b1+/-Sca-1+/- mesenchymal progenitor cells. OSMR protein was expressed by vascular beds in the BM as detected by IHC. Confirming the indirect effect of OSM, we found that recombinant OSM had no effect on HSPC chemotaxis in response to CXCL12, or HSPC adhesion to immobilized VCAM-1 or selectins in vitro. However, HSPC freshly isolated from the BM of OSMR-/- mice had enhanced chemotaxis in response to CXCL12 compared to HSPC isolated from WT mice. In conclusion, G-CSF increases OSM expression in the BM, and this appears to restrain HSPC mobilization in response to G-CSF via OSMR-expressing endothelial and mesenchymal cells that decreases HSPC responsiveness to CXCL12 gradient.
