    "abstract_text": "In this study, we examined gene expression profiles of immunomagnetically enriched CD34+ cells from bone marrow (BM) of 9 patients with untreated CML in chronic phase and from 8 healthy volunteers using Affymetrix GeneChips. Additionally, in 3 patients CD34+ from peripheral blood (PB) were compared with those from BM. Differential expression of 12 candidate genes was corroborated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Following hybridization of labelled cRNA to Affymetrix GeneChips covering 8793 genes we used the statistical scripting language \u201cR\u201d for data analysis. For normalization a method of variance stabilization transformations was used. To identify significantly differentially expressed genes we used the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) algorithm. The intraindividual comparison of CD34+ cells from BM and PB in CML showed no differentially expressed genes which is different to normal CD34+ cells which had distinct gene expression patterns comparing circulating and sedentary CD34+ cells (Steidl et al., Blood, 2002). Comparing malignant BM CD34+ cells from CML with normal BM CD34+ cells 792 genes were significantly differentially expressed (fold change: >1.3; q-value: 3-log (major molecular remission) during therapy. Comparing pretherapeutic gene expression profiles of both groups we could not identify a pattern predictive for major molecular response. In conclusion, malignant CD34+ cells in CML have a specific gene expression pattern which seems not to be predictive for response to imatinib therapy.",
