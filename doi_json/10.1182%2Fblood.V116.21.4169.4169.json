    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4169 Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is an indolent B-cell neoplasm involving the spleen, bone marrow, and, in a fraction of cases, the peripheral blood. With the exception of TP53 disruption in a minority of cases, the molecular pathogenesis of SMZL is poorly understood. Although activation of the NF-kB pathway occurs frequently in SMZL, knowledge of the genetic mechanism driving NF-kB deregulation in this lymphoma is lacking. This study aims at providing a comprehensive molecular characterization of the NF-kB pathway in SMZL. The study included 99 SMZL, and followed a discovery-validation approach. Mutation analysis of 33 NF-kB pathway genes ( BIRC2 , BIRC3 , BCL10 , CARD11 , CD40 , CD79A , CD79B , CHUK , CSNK1A1 , CYLD , IKBKB , IKBKG , MALT1 , MAP3K14 , MAP3K7 , MAP3K7IP2 , MAP3K7IP3 , NFKB1 , NFKBIA , NFKBIB , PRKCB1 , REL , RIPK1 , TNFAIP3 , TNFRSF11A , TNFRSF13C , TNFSF13B , TRAF1 , TRAF2 , TRAF3 , TRAF4 , TRAF5 , TRAF6 ) was applied to a discovery panel of 16 SMZL. The discovery panel allowed the identification of at least 1 mutated case (probability >0.9) for mutations whose prevalence is \u2265 10% in the SMZL population. Genes found to be mutated in the discovery panel were further sequenced in a cohort of 83 SMZL in order to characterize the frequency and recurrency of the genetic lesion. Copy number changes of the 33 NF-kB genes investigated were obtained by SNP array (GeneChip Human Mapping 250K NspI, Affimetrix). SMZL was characterized by an array of lesions affecting genes at different levels of the NF-kB pathway. Overall, 15/99 SMZL (15.0%) carried somatic mutations in genes regulating the NF-kB pathway, including TNFAIP3 , TRAF3 , BIRC3 and CD79A . Mutations of TNFAIP3 , TRAF3 , BIRC3 and CD79A were mutually exclusive among SMZL cases. Mutations of TNFAIP3 were most frequent and occurred in 6/99 (6.0%) SMZL. All mutations were represented by small insertions/deletions leading to frameshift. By SNP array, deletions encompassing TNFAIP3 were observed in 9/99 (9.0%) SMZL. By combining SNP array and mutation analysis, 13/99 (13.0%) SMZL harbored TNFAIP3 disruption by mutation and/or deletion. Mutations of TRAF3 occurred in 4/99 (4.0%) SMZL. Mutations were small insertions/deletions leading to frameshift (n=2), non-sense mutations (n=1), and missense mutations (n=1). By SNP array, deletions encompassing TRAF3 were observed in 7/99 (7.7%) SMZL. By combining SNP array and mutation analysis, 10/99 (10.0%) SMZL harbored TRAF3 disruption by mutation and/or deletion. Mutations of BIRC3 occurred in 4/99 (4.0%) SMZL. Mutations were non-sense mutations (n=1) or insertions/deletions leading to frameshift (n=3). By SNP array, deletions encompassing BIRC3 were observed in 5/99 (5.0%) SMZL. By combining SNP array and mutation analysis, 9/99 (9.0%) SMZL harbored BIRC3 disruption by mutation and/or deletion. Mutations and deletion of BIRC3 were mutually exclusive, suggesting a haploinsufficiency effect of BIRC3 genetic lesions. One mutation of the CD79A gene was observed out of 99 SMZL, and was represented by a single bp insertion leading to frameshift of the entire ITAM domain. Overall, by combining mutation analysis with SNP array data of the TNFAIP3 , TRAF3 , BIRC3 and CD79A genes, 28/99 (28.2%) SMZL harbored at least one genetic lesion affecting the NF-kB pathway. The prevalence of genetic lesions affecting the NF-kB pathway did not differ between HCV- (20/77, 26.0%) and HCV+ (4/15, 26.7%) SMZL (p=1.000). Also, the prevalence of NF-kB pathway genetic lesions did not differ among SMZL subgroups defined by TP53 disruption, immunoglobulin gene mutation status, or stereotyped B cell receptor. These observations document that genetic lesions targeting the NF-kB pathway by mutation and/or deletion are frequently involved in the pathogenesis of SMZL and might provide novel therapeutic targets for this lymphoma. The novel finding of BIRC3 inactivating mutations in SMZL points to a more general role of BIRC3 (also known as cIAP2 ) in marginal zone lymphoma, since BIRC3/cIAP2 is also involved in the t(11;18) translocation of MALT lymphoma.
