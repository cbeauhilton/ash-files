    "abstract_text": "The fusion of the genes for core binding factor beta and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain ( CBFB-MYH11 ) is the recurrent mutation found in inversion 16 (inv(16)) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The expressed fusion protein, CBF\u03b2-SMMHC, binds to the transcriptional regulator RUNX1, and this interaction is required for leukemogenesis. Recent data shows CBF\u03b2-SMMHC and RUNX1 are associated with promoters of both transcribed and repressed genes, implying that the CBF\u03b2-SMMHC:RUNX1 complex directly regulates target gene expression. However, it is not known whether other transcriptional co-factors are also required for this activity. Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) removes acetyl groups from histone tails to regulate the accessibility of chromatin to transcriptional machinery. It is recruited to chromatin by transcription factors, including RUNX1. HDAC1 also colocalizes with RUNX1 and CBF\u03b2-SMMHC to promoter regions in ME-1 cells, a human inv(16) cell line. Based on this, we hypothesized that HDAC1 could bind to the RUNX1: CBF\u03b2-SMMHC complex and plays a role in transcriptional regulation in inv(16). To test if CBF\u03b2-SMMHC and HDAC1 form a complex, we transfected COS-7 cells with expression plasmids for HDAC1-FLAG and CBF\u03b2-SMMHC and performed immunoprecipitations (IP) with nuclear extracts. IP with anti-MYH11 showed an interaction between HDAC1 and CBF\u03b2-SMMHC, as did IP with anti-FLAG. Importantly, we found that HDAC1 and CBF\u03b2-SMMHC co-immunoprecipitate in mouse leukemia cells from our knockin model which expresses CBF\u03b2-SMMHC from the endogenous CBF\u03b2 promoter (CBF\u03b2-SMMHC+). Confirming the specificity of this interaction, we found that IP with anti-MYH11 in ME-1 cells shows HDAC1 interaction, but the same IP in the t(8;21) AML cell line Kasumi-1 did not show HDAC1 interaction even though similar levels of HDAC1 are expressed. We next tested whether RUNX1 mediates the interaction between CBF\u03b2-SMMHC and HDAC1. We performed IP experiments using a CBF\u03b2-SMMHC mutant lacking RUNX1 binding (CBF\u03b2-SMMHC N63K,N104K , \u0394179-221 ). This mutant was co-immunoprecipitated with HDAC1, but not RUNX1, indicating that CBF\u03b2-SMMHC's interaction with HDAC1 does not require RUNX1. We tested a construct lacking the c-terminal 95 amino acids, CBF\u03b2-SMMHC \u0394C95 , the domain known to interact with the related protein, HDAC8. We found that HDAC1 immunoprecipitated with CBF\u03b2-SMMHC \u0394C95 , suggesting that HDAC1 binds to a unique region of CBF\u03b2-SMMHC. To test if HDAC1 plays a role in CBF\u03b2-SMMHC-mediated gene expression, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitations on mouse CBF\u03b2-SMMHC+ primary leukemia cells with antibodies against HDAC1, RUNX1, and MYH11, followed by real-time PCR for the promoter regions of three CBF\u03b2-SMMHC target genes: MPO, CSF1R, and CEBPD. We observed all three proteins enriched on the target gene promoters as compared to immunoglobulin controls. This indicates that HDAC1 localizes with CBF\u03b2-SMMHC and RUNX1 on target gene promoters in mouse primary leukemia cells. To test if HDAC1 is required for expression of these target genes, we used shRNA to knockdown Hdac1 expression. Mouse CBF\u03b2-SMMHC+ leukemia cells were transduced with one of 2 different shRNAs against Hdac1 or with a control construct. We found that expression of all three genes was decreased with Hdac1 knockdown, implying that HDAC1 is required for CBF\u03b2-SMMHC induced changes in gene expression. These results also suggest that HDAC1 may have a role in transcriptional activation for certain genes, which is in contrast to its traditional role as a transcriptional repressor. These findings imply that HDAC1 activity is required for the maintenance of CBF\u03b2-SMMHC expressing leukemia cells, and that HDAC1 inhibitors may be effective against inv(16) AML. To test this possibility we performed colony-forming assays using mouse leukemia cells grown in the presence of two different HDAC inhibitors, entinostat which is specific for HDAC1, and vorinostat, a nonspecific HDAC inhibitor. Our preliminary results indicate that both entinostat and vorinostat reduce the ability of primary CBF\u03b2-SMMHC+ mouse leukemia cells to form colonies as compared to the vehicle control, while having minimal effects on growth of normal hematopoietic cells. In summary, we demonstrated that HDAC1 forms a complex with CBF\u03b2-SMMHC and is required for its regulation of target gene expression, and that HDAC inhibitors may be effective for the treatment of inv(16) AML patients.
