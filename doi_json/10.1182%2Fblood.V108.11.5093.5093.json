    "abstract_text": "Background The combination of thalidomide/dexamethasone (TD) induces remission in approximately 70% of previously untreated patients with low or intermediate tumor mass. TD appeared superior to previous programs because of the high response rate and reasonable survival and its low frequency of serious complications. The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy of thalidomide plus dexamethasone as first line therapy and the incidence of deep vein thrombosis. Material and methods Patients with newly diagnosed and symptomatic MM (untreated patients) were evaluated. We enrolled all patients who fulfilled entire criteria for multiple myeloma between January 1998 and December 2005. Patients were divided into 2 groups: thalidomide plus dexamethasone (TD) and VAD group. The present study is a prospective, descriptive, longitudinal and observational one. Thalidomide was prescribed in an oral dose of 100 mg qhs and increased by 50 mg every 7 days to a maximum dose of 300 mg, depending on side effects. Dexamethasone was given in an oral dose of 20 mg/m2 each morning after breakfast on days 1\u20134, 9\u201312 and 17\u201320, followed by 10 days without therapy prior to the next cycle. Treatment with the combination was continued for at least 6 months or until the earliest occurance of maximum plateau of myeloma protein reduction, autologous transplant-supported intensification or other treatments. VAD was given as an Out-patient regimen including: vincristine (0.4mg/day, continuous IV), doxorubicin (9mg/m2/day, continuous IV) and dexamethasone (40 mg/day PO) with a median of 6 courses. Citrate plasma was used to investigate coagulation and anticoagulation parameters. Results Sixty newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients were included in the study, 35 (58%) male and 25 (42%) female, aged 45\u201385 (mean 63). Underlying diagnosis was IgG MM in 44 (73.3%), IgA in 12 (20%) and light chain disease in 4 (6.7%). Clinical characteristics were similar for both groups. According to Durie Salmon criteria patients were grouped into: IA (n6, 10%), IB (n3, 5%), IIA (n12, 20%), IIB (n6, 10%), IIIA (n19, 31.6%) and IIIB (n14, 23.4%). The frequency of response (CR, NCR/VGPR and PR) in the group of thalidomide and dexamethasone was 73% being higher than VAD (53%)p0.005. CR was observed in 5 patients treated with thalidomide/dexamethasone (16%). Thrombosis complications DVT was observed in 7 patients. DVT occurred in 4 patients treated with TD and 3 with VAD. From the last 40 patients, 5 presented APC-R and 3 of them developed DVT. A significant shorter time to DVT was observed in patients exposed to VAD chemotherapy (first 2 cycles p 0.007). Patients developing APC-R were tested for Factor V Leiden mutation resulting negative. After patients developed any response criteria were retested for acquired activated protein C resistance, all of them went back to normal. Finally we conclude TD is an effective, less toxic therapy in comparison with VAD as first line therapy and in order to reduce incidence of DVT effective prophylactic anticoagulation should be implemented in all controlled trials, at least during the first few cycles of treatment.",
