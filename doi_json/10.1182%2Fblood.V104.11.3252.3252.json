    "abstract_text": "The peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) post-autologous stem cell transplantation is an independent predictor for survival in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. The role of ALC recovery during and after standard CHOP chemotherapy for newly diagnosed diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has not been reported. We hypothesized that ALC recovery during/after CHOP chemotherapy has a direct impact on survival. 135 consecutive newly diagnosed patients with DLBCL treated with CHOP from 1994 through 2000 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary end point was to assess the role of ALC recovery during and after CHOP on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The ALC recovery before each of the 6 cycles and at 3 months follow-up after completion of therapy were analyzed. Of the 135 patients, 41 patients received concomitant radiation therapy. The median age was 64 years (range: 21\u201383) and median follow-up was 46 months (range: 1\u2013124). Superior OS and PFS were identified in patients achieving the ALC cut-off value that discriminated clinical outcomes at a high level of significance for blood counts obtained before cycles 1 (ALC \u2265 1.5 x 10 9 /L, OS = not reached vs 54 months, p< 0.0048; PFS = not reached vs 23 months, p <0.0005), 2 (ALC \u22651.5 x 10 9 /L, OS = not reached vs 59 months, p <0.0255; PFS = not reached vs 30 months, p <0.0082), 3(ALC \u22651.2 x 10 9 /L, OS = not reached vs 59 months, p<0.0074; not reached vs 30 months, p <0.0060), and at 3 months (ALC \u2265 1.2 x 10 9 /L, OS = not reached vs 60 months, p< 0.0080; PFS = not reached vs 42 months, p < 0.0017). Similar cut-off points for cycles 4 through 6 could not be identified. The ALC recovery between each cycles 1\u20133 and at 3 months were not independent of each other. Multivariate analysis demonstrated ALC for cycles 1\u20133 and at 3 months post CHOP to be independent prognostic factor for OS and PFS when compared to other significant prognostic factors including International Prognostic Index and radiation therapy. Patients were stratified into three groups based on whether or not they achieved cut-off values of ALC in the first 3 cycles: group I= ALC achieved in at least 2 of 3 cycles; group II= ALC achieved in only 1/3 cycles; and group III= ALC cut-off not achieved. A trend towards worse OS (p< 0.0035) (Figure 1) and PFS (p< 0.0003) was identified if patients did not achieve any of the cut-off values of ALC in the first 3 cycles. These data further support the hypothesis that there is a critical role of lymphocyte (immune) recovery during and after CHOP chemotherapy in DLBCL.
