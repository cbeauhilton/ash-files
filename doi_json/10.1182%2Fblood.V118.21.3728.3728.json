    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3728 Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a distinct and aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) commonly presenting with pleural, peritoneal, or pericardial malignant effusions usually without a contiguous tumor mass. PEL is most commonly diagnosed in HIV-positive patients, accounting for 4% of all NHLs in this population, yet may also develop in immunosuppressed HIV-negative individuals. While Human Herpes Virus 8 (HHV8 or Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus) is directly implicated in the oncogenesis of this lymphoma, most PEL cases are also associated with Epstein-Barr virus and the combination of the two may facilitate transformation. The tumor cells exhibit plasmablastic features and express CD45, CD38, CD138, HHV8 and CD30. PEL is an aggressive tumor characterized by a short median survival of only 6 months with current therapeutic approaches underscoring the urgent need for development of new therapeutics. Brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody cAC10 conjugated by a protease-cleavable dipeptide linker to a potent cell killing agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). Following binding to CD30, brentuximab vedotin is rapidly internalized and is transported to lysosomes, where the peptide linker is selectively cleaved allowing binding of the released MMAE to tubulin and leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Brentuximab vedotin was recently reported to have promising antitumor activity in CD30 expressing tumors, such as Hodgkin and Anaplastic large cell lymphomas. Since PEL tumors are reported to express CD30, we have hypothesized that brentuximab vedotin might be effective in the treatment of this NHL subtype. Initially, we have confirmed by flow cytometry the expression of CD30 on PEL cell lines (UM-PEL 1, UM-PEL 3, BC-1 and BC-3), and by review of immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry results in patients with previous diagnosis of PEL at our institution. To examine in vitro potency of brentuximab vedotin, UM-PEL 1, UM-PEL 3, BC-1 and BC-3 PEL cell lines were treated with brentuximab vedotin at concentration ranging from 0\u2013100 micrograms/ml. Staining with YO-PRO and Propidium Iodide (PI) demonstrated dose dependent cell apoptosis and death in all the cell lines at 72 hours post treatment. In contrast, control IgG conjugated with MMAE failed to induce apoptosis and cell death of PEL cell lines confirming specific brentuximab vedotin cytotoxicity. Furthermore, brentuximab vedotin decreased proliferation of PEL cells at 48 hours leading to a complete proliferation arrest at 72 hours, as measured by MTS assay. These effects were absent after equivalent doses of control IgG conjugated drug treatment. Supportive to this, labeling of cells with PI to detect active DNA content by flow cytometry showed that bretuximab vedotin induced growth arrest in G2/M phase. To further establish the anti-tumor potential of brentuximab vedotin in vivo, we used the direct xenograft UM-PEL 1 model, established in our laboratory (Sarosiek, PNAS 2010), which mimics human PEL tumors. UM-PEL 1 bearing mice were injected intraperitoneally 3 times a week with brentuximab vedotin or control IgG conjugated MMAE for 4 weeks. Brentuximab vedotin treatment markedly prolonged overall survival of UM-PEL-1 bearing mice compared to controls (p Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
