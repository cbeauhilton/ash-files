    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5084 Background: Waldeyer's ring (WR) is circular band of lymphoid tissue located at the opening of the respiratory and digestive tract. There is controversy as to whether WR should be considered as a nodal or extranodal site. In this study, we conducted retrospective analyses of WR involving MZLs (WR-MZLs) to identify their clinical features, treatment, prognosis- favor nodal or extranodal. And we want to get additional information about specific organ relationship between WR-MZL and other MALT sites. Patients and Methods: From 1987 to 2010, 124 patients who were histologically confirmed as a MZL arising from head and neck (H&N) area was including WR (47 patients) were reviewed. Primary orbit and ocular adnexa MZL patient was excluded this data collection. Results: The male/female ratio of the 47 patients was 23 to 24. The median age was 53 years (range, 17\u201377). The commonly involving sites were tonsil (53.2%) followed by nasopharyn (40.4%). Fourteen patients (29.7%) were accompanied with extra-WR area MALT site- gastrointestinal tract (14.9%), ocular and adnexa (12.8%). Ann Arbor stage I/II disease was present in 50% (23 out of 46). Thirty-nine patients were categorized into the low/low-intermediate risk group (84.8%) according to International Prognostic Index (IPI). Complete and partial remissions were achieved in 18 (78.3%) and 2 (8.7%) of the 23 stage I/II patients. In 23 patients with stage III/IV, CR and PR were achieved in 15 (65.2%) and 4 (17.4%), respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.6 years (95% CI, 2.4\u20134.8 years). The estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) was 88%. Compared with H&N MALT site MZLs, WR-MZLs were significantly poor in PFS and OS (P=0.005 and P=0.007). Conclusion: WR-MZLs were also an indolent disease like general MZL. But, WR-MZL patients presented with more advanced stage and poorer survivals than other site H&N MZL patients. Therefore, even though WR has been considered histologically extranodal MALT organ, clinically it is closer to nodal MZL. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
