    "abstract_text": "Background: Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a Philadelphia chromosome\u2013negative myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by persistent thrombocytosis, excessive proliferation of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, and normal erythrocyte mass. As with the other Philadelphia chromosome\u2013negative MPNs, myelofibrosis (MF) and polycythemia vera (PV), ET is associated with dysregulated Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling. Ruxolitinib is an oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor that has shown clinical benefit in patients with MF and PV. Objective: To report the long-term efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib in patients with ET from an open-label, phase II study (INCB18424-256; NCT00726232) in patients with ET or PV. Long-term results from the patients with PV have been published (Verstovsek S et al, Cancer. 2014;120:513-520). Methods: Eligible patients had ET refractory to or intolerant of hydroxyurea as assessed by the investigator, platelet count > 650 \u00d7 10 9 /L unless receiving treatment, and absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1.2 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Efficacy endpoints included achievement of platelet counts \u2264 400 \u00d7 10 9 /L in patients with baseline counts > 400 \u00d7 10 9 /L, platelet count \u2264 600 \u00d7 10 9 /L in patients with baseline counts > 600 \u00d7 10 9 /L, white blood cell (WBC) counts \u2264 10 \u00d7 10 9 /L in patients with baseline counts > 10 \u00d7 10 9 /L, and a \u2265 50% reduction in palpable splenomegaly in patients with a palpable spleen at baseline. Patients assessed their ET-related symptoms (pruritus, bone pain, night sweats, asthenia, and paresthesia) on a scale from 0 (not present) to 10 (worst imaginable) at each study visit, reporting the worst level of symptoms experienced during the 7 days preceding the study visit. Patients who discontinued were counted as nonresponders for all response analyses. Results: At baseline (N = 39), median age was 51.0 years, median disease duration was 87.6 months, median hematocrit was 40.4%, median platelet count was 849.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L, and median WBC was 8.15 \u00d7 10 9 /L. At the time of data cutoff, the median exposure to ruxolitinib was 205.6 weeks (approximately 4 years; median total daily dose 30.1 mg) and 61.5% of patients were still receiving treatment. The majority of patients (71.8%) received ruxolitinib for \u2265 96 weeks (24 months). Platelet count decreased rapidly after initiation of therapy and remained relatively stable over time ( Figure 1 ). Of the patients with baseline platelet count > 400 \u00d7 10 9 /L (n = 38), 2.6%, 10.5%, and 13.2% of patients had a platelet count \u2264 400 \u00d7 10 9 /L at week 12, 48, and 192 (month 3, 12, and 48), respectively. Of the patients with baseline platelet count > 600 \u00d7 10 9 /L (n = 35), 48.6%, 40.0%, and 57.1% of patients had a platelet count \u2264 600 \u00d7 10 9 /L at week 12, 48, and 192, respectively. Of the patients with baseline WBC count > 10 \u00d7 10 9 /L (n = 11), 100%, 72.7%, and 72.7% of patients had a WBC count \u2264 10 \u00d7 10 9 /L at week 12, 48, and 192, respectively. Of the 4 patients with palpable spleen at baseline (median 5.0 cm), all patients achieved \u2265 50% reduction and 3 patients achieved absence of palpable splenomegaly by the week 36 visit. Rapid reductions in pruritus, bone pain, night sweats, asthenia, and paresthesia symptom scores were reported by patients during the study, which were largely sustained through week 192 ( Figure 2 ). New or worsening grade 3 or 4 leukopenia, neutropenia, and lymphopenia occurred in 3 patients each (7.7%), and new or worsening grade 3 anemia occurred in 1 patient (2.6%). The most common nonhematologic adverse events of any grade regardless of causality were increased weight (35.9%), diarrhea (28.2%), cough (25.6%), and headache (25.6%). Most adverse events were grade 1 or 2. Infections of any grade were reported in 26 patients (66.7%); of these, grade \u2265 3 infections were reported in 2 patients (5.1%; n = 1, bronchitis and n = 1, pneumonia). No patients experienced transformation to post-ET MF or acute myeloid leukemia. Conclusions: Ruxolitinib treatment was generally well tolerated in this population of patients with ET who were refractory or intolerant to hydroxyurea and resulted in improvements in platelet count, WBC count, splenomegaly, and disease-related symptoms.
