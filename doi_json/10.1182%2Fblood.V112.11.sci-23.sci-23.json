    "abstract_text": "Acute viral infections induce long-term humoral and cellular immunity. However, the nature of T- and B-cell memory is different. Antiviral B-cell memory is usually manifested by continuous antibody production that lasts for many years after infection or vaccination. In contrast, the effector phase of the T cell response is short-lived (a few weeks), and \u201cmemory\u201d in the T-cell compartment results from the presence of memory T cells, which are found at higher frequencies and can respond faster and develop into effector cells (i.e., CTL or cytokine producers) more efficiently than can nai\u0308ve T cells. In this talk, I will discuss the following aspects of immunological memory: Functional differences between nai\u0308ve and memory T cells; Memory T cell differentiation and memory cell subsets; and Protective immunity by memory CD8 T cells.",
