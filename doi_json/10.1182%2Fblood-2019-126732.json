    "abstract_text": "Introduction: PATP in solid cancer patients remains uncertain and is not routinely recommended although thrombosis is shown to be the second leading cause of death in cancer patients. Many studies failed to demonstrate in solid cancer outpatients improvement in overall survival despite decreasing venous thromboembolism (VTE) rates by PATP. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs to determine the benefit and risk of PATP with low-molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with gastrointestinal cancers receiving chemotherapy. Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature search using MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through June 30, 2019. The references of all potential studies were also reviewed for any additional relevant studies. The RCTs with reduction in VTE as a primary or secondary endpoint and the major bleeding (MB) as a safety outcome were incorporated in the analysis. The primary meta- analytic approach was a fixed effects model using the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) method. It was used to calculate the estimated pooled risk ratio (RR), and risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed with Cochran's Q- statistic. Results: A total of 1,932 patients with gastric, gastroesophageal junctional (GEJ) and colorectal cancers from a subgroup of three RCTs were included in our meta-analysis. The prophylactic doses of LMWHs and DOAC (rivaroxaban) were used in the studies. The duration of LMWH and DOAC ranged from 3 to 6 months. The randomization ratio was 2 to 1 in PROTECHT study and 1 to 1 in all other studies. The I 2 statistic for heterogeneity was 0, suggesting homogeneity among RCTs. The VTE incidence was 13 (1.26%) in PATP group and 23 (2.55%) in control group with a RR of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.25 to 0.96, P = 0.04). The absolute RD in VTE was -0.01 (95% CI: -0.03 to -0.00, P 0.04) with an estimate of the number needed to treat (NNT) of 78 to prevent one VTE event. In a subset of patients with gastric and GEJ cancers (n=587), the VTE incidence was 4 (1.37%) in PATP group and 10 (3.40%) in control group with a RR of 0.40 (95% CI: 0.13 to 1.24, P = 0.11). Conclusions: In our study, the relative risk reduction is 48% with a NNT of 78 to prevent one VTE in ambulatory patients with gastrointestinal cancers. Nevertheless, there is no statistically significant reduction in VTE events in a subset of gastric and GEJ cancers which are considered high risk in Khorana score. Based on the findings, PATP is not recommended in patients with gastrointestinal cancers on chemotherapy at this time. Further studies are necessary to define high risk subsets of gastrointestinal cancer patients receiving chemotherapy who may benefit from PATP.
