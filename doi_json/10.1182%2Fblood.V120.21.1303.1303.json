    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1303 B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) is the most common form of cancer in children, characterized by genetic aberrations affecting master regulators of lymphoid differentiation, such as RUNX1, IKZF1, TCF3 , and PAX5 , as well as tumor suppressor genes that control the cell cycle, including RB1 and CDKN2A . Another gene frequently altered in BCP-ALL is BTG1 , which displays highly clustered mono-allelic deletions in childhood BCP-ALL (9%) and adult ALL (6%). The frequency of BTG1 deletions is two- to three-fold higher in ETV6-RUNX1 - and BCR-ABL1 -positive leukemias. BTG1, and its close homologue BTG2 regulate gene expression, for instance by associating with protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), affecting the activity of a variety of transcription factors, including several nuclear hormone receptors and HoxB9. In addition, BTG1 and BTG2 have been implicated in regulating mRNA stability by interacting with the Ccr4-Not complex. Recent studies have also identified missense point mutations in BTG1 and BTG2 in about 20% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, arguing that altered function of these genes contributes to B cell malignancies. To investigate a role of BTG1 and BTG2 in B cell development, we studied the phenotype of Btg1 and Btg2 single knockout (KO) and Btg1;Btg2 double KO mice. Animals deficient for either BTG1 or BTG2 displayed a mild B cell phenotype with a moderate reduction of \u223c20% in the total amount of B220 + progenitor B cells in bone marrow, while splenic B cells were present at normal frequencies. More detailed analyses revealed that Btg1 \u2212/\u2212 and Btg2 \u2212/\u2212 mice both showed a partial block at the pre-pro-B cell stage (Hardy fraction A). Methylcellulose colony assays in the presence of interleukin-7 (IL-7) demonstrated 30% fewer colonies using bone marrow from Btg2 \u2212/\u2212 mice, whereas 70% fewer colonies were obtained using bone marrow derived from Btg1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. To assess whether BTG1 and BTG2 fulfill redundant functions during B cell development, we analyzed the phenotype of Btg1 \u2212/\u2212 ;Btg2 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Hence we observed that the combined loss of BTG1 and BTG2 led to a much stronger block in B cell differentiation, with the majority of progenitor B cells arrested at the pre-pro-B cell stage. In the spleens of these double knockout mice we observed a roughly 50% reduction in B220+ IgM+ B cells, suggesting that these genes act to modify the activity of B lineage transcription factors rather than to fully block their activities. This is consistent with a role for these genes as modifiers of transcriptional activity. Current studies are aimed at defining the molecular targets regulated by BTG1 and BTG2 during early B cell development using RNA sequencing and protein interaction experiments. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that BTG1 and BTG2 act as important regulators of normal B cell differentiation, and that this function might be critical for their role as tumor suppressors in (early) B cell malignancies.
