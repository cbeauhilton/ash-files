    "abstract_text": "Introduction Disruption of miR34a, -b, and -c has been implicated in lymphomagenesis, and in CLL it has been suggested that miR34a expression is a surrogate marker for TP53 disruption associated with a poor prognosis. P53 is a transcription factor for the miR34s, and overexpression of miR34s in p53 deficient cells can reinstate p53 functions (Chang et al , Mol Cell 26, 2007, He et al , Nature 447, 2007). However, in cellular senescence miR34a may be activated independently of p53 (Christoffersen et al , Cell Death Differ 17, 2010). A recent multicenter study shows that in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), TP53 disruption is still a negative prognostic factor for survival after the implementation of Rituximab (Xu-Monette et al , Blood 19, 2012). Information on the role of the miR34s in normal CD19+ B-cells (PBL-B), activated B-cells, and de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is limited. Aims Given that MIR34A and MIR34B/C locate to regions of allelic loss in DLBCL (1p36.23 and 11q23.1, respectively), and the importance of the miR34 targets in DLBCL pathogenesis, we investigated a large panel of newly diagnosed cases of DLBCLs for MIR34A and MIR34B/C promoter methylation, TP53 mutational status, clinical presentation patterns, and outcome. Methods MIR34A/B/C promotor methylation was performed by MsMCA and bisulfite sequencing. Histone modifcations at the MIR34A/B/C promotor was examined by ChIP RT-qPCR. Expression of miR34s was performed using miRCURY LNA\u2122 Universal RT-qPCR. The coding sequences and splice sites of exons 5-9 of the TP53 gene were scanned for mutations by PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Differences in clinical characteristics using the one-way Anova, the Pearson chi-square, or Fisher\u2019s exact tests. Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. For assessment of independent predictors of survival a multivariate Cox regression hazard model with backward stepwise (likelihood ratio) entry was applied. Effects not meeting a p-value < 0.05 were removed from the model. Results We show that only miR34a-5p is expressed in PBL-B, and significantly induced in activated B-cells ( P =0.017) and reactive lymph nodes ( P <0.001). No significant induction of the other miR34s is observed. In PBL-B, the MIR34A and MIR34B/C promoters are unmethylated, but the latter show enrichment for the H3K4me3/H3K27me3 silencing mark. One hundred and twenty two (81%) of 150 de novo DLBCLs carried one or more of the following alterations: TP53 mutations: 24 (16%), MIR34A methylation: 42 (28%), and MIR34B/C methylation: 116 (77%). Nine cases (6%) carried combined TP53 mutation and methylation of MIR34A . MIR34B/C methylation, and either mutation of TP53 or methylation of MIR34A (+/- MIR34B/C methylation) did not influence survival. However, the 9 patients with concomitant mutation of TP53 and MIR34A methylation had a median survival of only 9.4 months ( P <0.0001), and multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that TP53/MIR34A \u201cdouble-hit\u201d is an independent negative prognostic factor for survival ( P =0.0002). Interestingly, none of the Rituximab treated patients with TP53 mutation only had died after >3 years, while all but one of those Rituximab treated patients with concommitant disruption of TP53 and MIR34A died within the first 13 months from diagnosis. In 2 DLBCL-cell lines with concomitant TP53 mutation and methylation of MIR34A, miR34a-5p was upregulated by 5-aza-2\u2019deoxycytidine. Conclusion Studies of many different cancer cell types including the present study suggest that miR34s for the larger part are downregulated by promoter hypermethylation, and we show that miR34a-5p can be upregulated by a hypomethylating agent in DLBCL cells with a methylated MIR34A promoter in cells with and without TP53 mutations. Thus we believe, we have identified a novel rare, aggressive, but treatable \u201cdouble-hit\u201d DLBCL. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
