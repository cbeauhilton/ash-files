    "abstract_text": "Background: Due to their lower incidence, pathological heterogeneity and varied geographical distribution, the clinicopathological features and prognostic factors in mature T/NK cell lymphomas have not been comprehensively studied in international studies. Materials and methods: Consecutive adult new cases of mature T cell neoplasms from 1990\u20132002 from 21 clinical centers in 13 countries were reviewed. NK/T nasal/nasal type lymphoma was defined by standard WHO criteria after central review. Results: Among 1159 cases of proven T cell lymphomas, 136 cases (11.7%) of NK/T lymphomas were registered (nasal 68%, nasal-type 26%, aggressive or unclassified 6%). Its incidence among T cell lymphoma was higher in Oriental (22%) than in Western countries (4%) and in Continental Asia (43%) than in Japan (11%, 19% excluding ATLL), where nasal-type subcategory is particularly uncommon (6% vs 42%). The median age was 49 years with male to female ratio of 2:1. The nasal-type cases had higher stage (p=0.0002) and LDH (p=0.01), more B symptoms (p=0.042), bulky disease (p=0.026) and poorer performance status (p50% (p=0.05), transformed T cell >40% (p=0.022), raised CRP (p=0.025), hemoglobin <11g/dl (p=0.0038), platelet count <150\u00d710 9 /l (p=0.0092), B symptoms (p=0.042) were associated with poorer OS on univariate analysis. Their prognostic values were retained on multivariate analysis, after controlling for factors used for the IPI, T-IPI and NK/T PI. However, none of the histological or clinical prognostic factors or prognostic indices was significant for nasal-type disease. Conclusion: The prognosis of nasal/nasal-type lymphoma is distinctly worse than other categories of peripheral T cell lymphomas. The clinical feature, treatment response and epidemiology of nasal type lymphoma is different from that of nasal NK lymphoma and the poor response preclude the finding of any favorable prognostic factors. There are still grounds for developing a better prognostic model for nasal cases to triage patients to more aggressive or novel treatment."
