    "abstract_text": "Background Results of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aloHSCT) depend on many patient-, donor- and procedure-related factors. In recent years, in a setting of AML we demonstrated that also socio-economic status of a country and center experience may influence outcome. The goal of the current analysis, focused on patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), was to evaluate specific effects on non-relapse mortality (NRM) related to health care expenditure (HCE) of a country as well as distribution of transplant centers in addition to previously studied human development index (HDI) and center activity. Patients and methods Results of myeloablative alloHSCT from HLA-identical siblings performed between 2004-2008 for adults with ALL in CR1 were analyzed. Among 983 individuals treated in 27 European countries the median age was 35 (18-55) years and the interval from diagnosis to alloHSCT \u2013 158 (42-831) days. TBI was used for conditioning in 820 (83%) cases and peripheral blood was a source of stem cells in 656 (67%) cases. The following factors were studied for their impact on outcome: current HCE, HCE as % of gross domestic product, public HCE, private HCE, no. of teams per country area and population, HDI and center activity (no. of alloHSCT for ALL in a study period). All variables were categorized by medians. The median follow-up was 34 months. Results In a univariate analysis the probability of day 100 NRM was increased for countries with lower current HCE (p=0.06), lower HDI (p=0.02) and for centers with lower experience (p=0.04). Also overall NRM was affected by current HCE (p=0.09), HDI (p=0.03) and center activity (p=0.07). In a multivariate model adjusted for recipient age, interval from diagnosis to HSCT, source of stem cells, type of conditioning, and donor/recipient gender, the variables of interest were included separately due to strong internal correlations. The best predictive model for day 100 NRM included HDI < median (HR = 2.38, 95%CI = 1.3-4.35, p=0.005). The overall NRM was most strongly predicted by current HCE < median (HR = 2.56, 95%CI = 1.41-4.76, p=0.002). In a univariate analysis lower values of HDI and current HCE were also associated with decreased probability of the overall survival (p=0.004 and p=0.006, respectively). Conclusion Both macroeconomic factors and the socio-economic status of a country influence strongly non-relapse mortality and overall survival after alloHSCT for adults with ALL. Our findings should be considered in interpretation of clinical studies in the field of alloHSCT. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
