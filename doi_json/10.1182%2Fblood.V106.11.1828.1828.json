    "abstract_text": "Obesity predicted decreased EFS in pediatric ALL (ASH 2004, Abstract#992). Here we report the effect of obesity, defined as body mass index >30, in 906 adults enrolled in two GIMEMA trials. The first study (1996\u20132001) included 45 obese (9.5%) and 426 non-obese patients. Obese patients were older, received lower total doses of vincristine (VCR) and daunomicin (DNR) and had more hepatic and pulmonary toxicity during induction than not-obese patients; the incidence of toxic deaths and complete remissions (CR) were similar. By multivariate analysis, obesity, high WBC, age >30y and presence of BCR-ABL at diagnosis independently predicted EFS. Hazard ratios (HR) for any events were respectively 1.506 (1.059\u20132.142, p=0.0228), 1.002 (1.001\u20131.003, p=0.0022)), 1.015 (1.006\u20131.025, p=0.0014) and 1.8 (1.4\u20132.4, p30 y of age and BCR-ABL-positive. The incidence of toxicity, toxic deaths and CR were similar in obese and non-obese patients. In the BCR-ABL negative patients, obesity tended to predict EFS. 2y-EFS was 26.6% in the obese and 49.4% in the non-obese patients (p=0.067). By multivariate analysis HR for any events of obesity, WBC>50 and age>30 were respectively 1.53 (0.92\u20132.58, p=0.107), 1.64 (1.12\u20132.39, p=0.012) and 1.74 (1.19\u20132.54, p=0.004). In conclusion, obesity seems associated with a poorer EFS in patients with BCR-ABL negative ALL; this might be caused by the lower doses of chemotherapy obese patients receive. Studies aimed to clarify chemotherapy pharmacokinetics, toxicity and efficacy in obese patients are warranted."
