    "abstract_text": "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is primarily characterized by the presence of leukemic B lymphocytes resistant to the process of apoptosis. Causes for this resistance include aberrant expression of multiple anti-apoptotic proteins, perhaps including Tcl-1 ( 1 ). Tcl-1 is expressed during normal development of both B and T cells and activates Akt to provide a survival signal through phosphorylation and inactivation of apoptotic pathway components. Overexpression of Tcl-1 in the B cells of transgenic mice results in a B-cell leukemia phenotype typical of human CLL, suggesting a primary role for Tcl-1 in CLL tumorigenesis. A recent report showed that Tcl-1 protein expression in CLL cells correlated with other biological parameters, but no data were available as to its clinical relevance ( 2 ). We therefore examined Tcl-1 expression in relation to clinical outcome using 51 peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from a Phase II clinical trial testing the combination of pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab in previously untreated CLL patients (Kay et al., ASH 2006). Tcl-1 protein expression was measured by immunoblot using GAPDH as a normalization control across lanes and lysate from a single Tcl-1 transgenic mouse spleen as a normalization control across immunoblots. All samples were run at least in duplicate and digital quantitation was performed using a ChemiDoc instrument (BioRad). Tcl-1 expression in patient cells was calculated in comparison to Tcl-1 expression in the mouse lysate, arbitrarily set to 1.0. Data were analyzed as a continuous measure as well as by specific cutoffs. Higher Tcl-1 expression was associated with failure to achieve a minimal residual disease-negative state after treatment. Specifically, Tcl-1 expression (measured as a continuous variable) was associated with residual disease measured by post-treatment CD5+/CD19+ cell percentages (continuous variable as well as dichotomized by cutpoint of 1.0% for CD5+/CD19+; p=0.03 for both comparisons). For the dichotomized Tcl-1 expression with the cutpoint of 0.275 (second tertile), this variable was marginally significantly associated with whether or not post-treatment CD5+/CD19+ was less than 1.0%. Using this same cutoff, there was also a suggestion that patients with reduced Tcl-1 were more likely to achieve a complete response. Finally, progression-free survival was shorter in patients with increased Tcl-1 expression, although these data did not reach statistical significance in this sample set.  . Tcl-1 < 0.275 .

These data further support the clinical relevance of the Tcl-1 mouse model to human CLL, and provide preliminary evidence that Tcl-1 protein expression correlates with clinical outcome of CLL patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy. If validated in larger studies, Tcl-1 expression may serve as a novel prognostic factor.",
