    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-33 Epigenetic deregulation of gene expression through aberrant DNA methylation or histone modification plays an important role in the malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells. In particular, acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) can be classified according to epigenetic signatures affecting DNA methylation or histone modifications affecting specific gene sets. Heterozygous somatic mutations in the loci encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 ( IDH1/2 ) occur in \u223c20% of AMLs and are accompanied by global DNA hypermethylation and hypermethylation and silencing of a number of specific gene promoters. IDH1/2 mutations are almost completely mutually exclusive with somatic loss-of-function mutations in TET2, which hydroxylates methylcytosine (mCpG). DNA hydroxymethylation can function as an intermediate step in mCpG demethylation. TET2 mutant de novo AMLs also display global and promoter specific hypermethylation partially overlapping with IDH1/2 mutant cases. Mutations in the IDH1/2 loci result in a neomorphic enzyme that generates the aberrant oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) using \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG) as a substrate. 2HG can disrupt the activity of enzymes that use \u03b1KG as a cofactor, including TET2 and the jumonji family of histone demethylases. Expression of mutant IDH isoforms inhibits TET2 hydroxymethylation and jumonji histone demethylase functions. IDH and TET2 mutant AMLs accordingly exhibit reduced levels of hydroxymethylcytosine and a trend towards increased histone methylation. Mutant IDH or TET2 loss of function causes differentiation blockade and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells and TET2 knockout results in a myeloproliferative phenotype in mice. Hydroxymethylcytosine is in abundance in hematopoietic stem cells and displays specific distribution patterns, yet the function of this covalent modification is not fully understood. Recent data link TET2 with the function of cytosine deaminases as a pathway towards DNA demethylation, which has implications as well for B cell lymphomas and CML lymphoid blast crisis, which are linked with the actions of activation induced cytosine deaminase. Altogether, the available data implicate mutations in IDH1/2 and TET2 in promoting malignant transformation in several tissues, by disrupting epigenomics programming and altering gene expression patterning.
