    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Topotecan has activity in several hematological malignancies. We have previosuly described a phase I trial of the combination of Topotecan, Cisplatin, Ara-C and Prednisolone (TOPOSHAP) ( Acta Haematol . 2004 ; 112 (3): 121 \u20135 ). In this phase I study the recomended doses were Topotecan 1,0 mg/m 2 /d, IV, given on days 1 to 3, Cisplatin 25 mg/m 2 /d, IV, on days 1 to 3, Ara-c 500 mg/m 2 , IV, on day 4, prednisolone 250 mg, IV, on days 1 to 4. Patients and Methods: We treated 22 patients (19 to 73 years old) with primary refractory or relapsed Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin\u2019s disease (HD), with measurable disease, with the TOPOSHAP regimen in the aforementioned doses. Tumor reponse was evaluated after the second cycle of this regimen. Results: Fifty four cycles of chemotherapy were given, ranging from 2 to 6 per patient. One patient died before completing the second cycle of chemotherapy. In the 19 evaluable patients we observed a response rate of 53% (5 CR and 6 PR). All patients had grade IV myelotoxicity and 8 required dose reduction. Seven patients had febrile neutropenia and 3 had mucositis, 2 had diarrhea and 1 had WHO grade 1 renal insuficiency. Conclusion: We conclude that the TOPOSHAP regimen is an active regimen for the salvage of refractory or relapsed patients with hematological lymphoid malignancies.",
