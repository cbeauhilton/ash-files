    "abstract_text": "Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T lymphocytes (CART cells) have shown benefit as an adjuvant immunotherapy in the treatment of B cell malignancies. This success of re-targeted T cells has not been extended to other hematologic malignancies. We have developed an immunotherapeutic approach to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using CAR T cells re-directed against the myeloid-specific antigen CD33 (CART-33). CART-33 cells are potent and specific in eliminating AML cells in vitro and in vivo. Despite this, CART-33 cells have shown poor in vivo expansion and persistence in NOD-SCID IL2r\u03b3 (-/-) (NSG) AML xenograft models. To address the reason for this, we assessed the impact of AML-expressed programmed death ligands 1 & 2 (PD-L1/2) on CART-33 cell activity. PD-L1 inhibits T cell functions upon binding PD-1, which is upregulated with T cell activation. Less is known about PD-L2's effect. Interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), a primary effector cytokine secreted by CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells, is a known potent inducer of PD-L1 on AML blasts. Using AML cell lines U937, Oci-AML3, CMK, and MV4-11 we show that IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and activated CART-33 supernatant can induce up-regulation of PD-L1 and PD-L2 on AML. IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 synergize strongly in up-regulating PD-1 ligands on AML. The kinetics and induction of PD-L2 are distinct from that of PD-L1. Although PD-L1 is well documented to suppress T cell function via ligation of T cell expressed PD-1, induction of PD-L1/L2 had no effect on the cytolytic activity of CART-33 cells against AML in short term (<48 h) cultures. Paradoxically, 24 hr pre-treatment of AML with either IFN-\u03b3 or CART-33 supernatant increased AML susceptibility to killing by CART-33 cells despite elevated expression of PD-L1/L2 by AML. Our results highlight the regulatory complexity of AML cytolysis by re-targeted T lymphocytes, and argue that tumor-expressed PD-L1 and PD-L2 impacts the sustainability, but not short-term killing activity, of adoptively transferred CAR T cells in the treatment of AML.
