    "abstract_text": "Background: Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) is a high-risk disease with a frequency of about 20% in patients of all ages. Ph-like ALL can be characterized in different groups based on their chromosomal rearrangements. The most common rearrangements involve CRLF2, ABL1, and EPOR and lead to activation of JAK kinase dependent activation of STAT5, PI3 kinase and other signaling pathways. We have previously shown that Ph-like ALL is a high-risk disease with a poor prognosis in older adults. The focus of this study is to further understand the biology of Ph-like ALL and how the cells develop drug resistance by modulating their signaling pathways to escape apoptosis. Results : We and others have identified activated STAT5 and AKT signaling in Ph-like ALL cell lines and patient samples. Interestingly, inhibition of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway using JAK-kinase inhibitors abrogated short term STA5 signaling as well as AKT signaling, but Ph-like ALL cells showed only a mild apoptotic effect or arrest in cell proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, even though xenotransplantation models of Ph-like ALL show a decrease in leukemia burden when treated with ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, all mice ultimately succumb to the disease, demonstrating that Ph-like ALL does not demonstrate oncogene addiction. Based on these results we hypothesize that Ph-like ALL cells can adapt to JAK kinase inhibition by activating other signaling pathways. To test this hypothesis, we performed a time course experiment in Ph-like ALL cell lines and detected AKT reactivation shortly after JAK-kinase inhibition. In addition, we detected activation of SYK and a reduction in the PI3K negative regulator PTPN6. These observations lead to the hypothesis that Ph-like ALL may have expression and activation of the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR). Indeed, gene expression data from the clinical trial P9906 demonstrate that Ph-like ALL cases with CRLF2-rearrangment and JAK2 mutations express high mRNA levels of pre-B cell receptor signaling molecules, including BLNK, IGGL1, VpreB3, and ZAP70. We next hypothesized that pre-BCR mediated activation of PI3 kinase rescues Ph-like ALL cells from JAK inhibition. To study PI3K signaling we first treated Ph-like ALL cell lines and xenografts with idelalisib or INCB-50465, both selective PI3K\u03b4 inhibitors. PI3K inhibition had only a minor effect on cell viability and again AKT was reactivated 48h later. Importantly, combining both JAK-kinase inhibition with PI3K inhibition, prevented AKT reactivation and had strong synergistic effect on cell viability and cell proliferation in vitro. Xenotransplantation models of Ph-like ALL with ruxolitinib and INCB-50465 showed a significantly lower leukemia burden as compared to the single agent treatments but disease eradication was not achieved. Pre-BCR signaling can also activate SRC family kinases and we hypothesized that CRLF2-rearanged Ph-like ALL might be sensitive to SRC inhibition as well. Strikingly, combining JAK2, PI3K, and SRC inhibition further reduced the cell viability by one log scale compared to the JAK2/PI3K inhibitor treated samples and less than 0,2% viable cells were detected, while other ALL subtypes were not affected. In vivo validation of treatment strategy is pending. Clinical relevance : While children with ALL currently have a 5-year survival rate of 90%, adults, especially those over the age of 40, have a very poor clinical outcome with survival rates of about 40%. Adults often do not tolerate high doses of chemotherapy regimens and are therefore in clinical need of alternative treatment regimens. We therefore combined JAK1/2 and PI3K inhibitory treatments with dasatinib, a frequently-used tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is well tolerated by older patients. Strikingly, the combinatory treatment had a strong effect on cell viability and represents so far, the first study using specific signaling inhibitors combined in Ph-like ALL. Conclusion : These findings identify that Ph-like ALL are not oncogene addicted like Ph+ ALL. While BCR-ABL1 activates multiple signaling pathways that can be inhibited with ABL kinase inhibitors, Ph-like ALL need to be treated with multiple inhibitors to induce the same effect. Here we show that a combination of JAK, PI3K and SRC-kinase inhibitors is needed to prevent reactivation of signaling pathways and to induce an apoptotic effect that may be clinically relevant.
