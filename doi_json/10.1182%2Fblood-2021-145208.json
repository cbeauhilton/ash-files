    "abstract_text": "Background: Magrolimab (Hu5F9-G4) is an antibody blocking CD47, a macrophage immune checkpoint and \"don't eat me\" signal on cancer cells, that eliminates leukemia stem cells by inducing tumor phagocytosis. Hypomethylating agents synergize with magrolimab by inducing \"eat me\" signals on leukemic blasts, thereby enhancing phagocytosis. Magrolimab with azacitidine (AZA) has shown encouraging activity in frontline acute myeloid leukemia (AML) unfit for intensive chemotherapy and myelodysplastic syndrome. In TP53 -mutant ( TP53 m) AML, it demonstrated an objective response rate of 69%, complete response (CR) rate of 45%, and median overall survival (OS) of 12.9 months. The TP53 gene mutation is observed in approximately 10-15% of newly diagnosed AML and is associated with poor survival. The published first-line median OS in TP 53m AML is 5-7 months, regardless of whether patients are treated with intensive chemotherapy or non-intensive approaches, such as a hypomethylating agent with venetoclax (VEN). AML patients harboring the TP53 gene mutation represent a significant unmet medical need. Aims: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of magrolimab+AZA vs physician's choice of VEN+AZA or \"7+3\" chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated TP53 m AML. Design and Methods: This is a phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Approximately 346 patients will be randomized (1:1) to magrolimab+AZA (investigational arm) or physician's choice of VEN+AZA or 7+3 chemotherapy, based on patient fitness (NCT04778397). Randomization will be stratified by appropriateness for non-intensive vs intensive therapy, geographic region (US vs non-US sites), and age (<75 vs \u226575 years). Patients are eligible if they are \u226518 years old with histologically confirmed AML with no prior antileukemic therapy, with at least one TP53 gene mutation that is not benign or likely benign (confirmed by central laboratory) or biallelic 17p deletions (based on a locally evaluated karyotype/fluorescence in situ hybridization report). During the first 28-day cycle, patients randomized to magrolimab+AZA will receive magrolimab intravenously (IV) at a priming dose of 1 mg/kg on Days 1 and 4, 15 mg/kg on Day 8, and 30 mg/kg on Days 11, 15, and 22. Magrolimab 30 mg/kg will then be administered weekly during cycle 2 and then every other week from cycle 3 onward. For patients randomized to the VEN+AZA arm, VEN and AZA will be administered according to labeled indications. Patients treated with 7+3 chemotherapy will receive 1-2 induction cycle(s) with IV daunorubicin or idarubicin on Days 1-3 and cytarabine 100 mg/m 2 or 200 mg/m 2 on Days 1-7 followed by up to 4 consolidation cycles with high-dose cytarabine (3,000 mg/m 2 ). Patients receiving magrolimab+AZA or VEN+AZA will remain on treatment until disease progression, relapse, loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicities, or stem cell transplant. Patients can undergo stem cell transplantation per investigator decision. The primary endpoint is OS in patients appropriate for non-intensive therapy, and the key secondary endpoint is OS in all patients. Status : Patients will be enrolled at approximately 140 centers globally. Accrual is ongoing.
