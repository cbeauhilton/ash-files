    "abstract_text": "Background: For children with AL candidate to receive an allograft and lacking a suitable HLA-matched donor, HLA-haplo-HSCT after abTCD may represent a valid alternative. Due to delayed recovery of adaptive T-cell immunity with abTCD-haplo-HSCT alone, we conducted a phase I/II trial testing the safety and efficacy of post-transplant infusion of a titrated number of donor-derived T cells transduced with the iC9 gene (rivogenlecleucel; ClinicalTrials.gov id: NCT02065869) in children with malignant and non-malignant diseases. Here, we report on the cohort of 70 patients with AL treated in Italy with abTCD-haplo-HSCT+rivogenlecleucel, comparing the results with those of 88 patients given abTCD-haplo-HSCT alone and previously published by our group (Blood 2018; 132:2594-2607). Patients and methods: Patients (age < 18 years) were transplanted between 2010 and 2018. Patient and disease characteristics are shown in Table 1. Median age at HSCT was 6 years (range 0.3-18), and median follow-up was 71 and 31 months for abTCD-haplo-HSCT and abTCD-haplo-HSCT+rivogenlecleucel, respectively. Compared to the control group, abTCD-haplo-HSCT+rivogenlecleucel recipients were transplanted more recently and from a younger donor, and received a higher number of CD34+ cells (Table 1). Diagnosis did not differ between the 2 groups, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) being the most frequent diagnosis. All patients were transplanted in morphological complete remission (CR1 and CR2) and received myeloablative preparation. Graft composition is reported in Table 1; notably all patients received >10x10 6 CD34+cells/Kg and <1x10 5 alpha-beta+ T-cells/Kg. Patients did not receive any pharmacological post-transplant graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. Results : Graft failure occurred in 2% of patients in each group. Median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 14 (6-23) and 11 (5-56) days, with no differences between groups (p=0.28). Rivogenlecleucel were infused at a median time of 21 days (range 11-59). Treatment was well tolerated; no infusion-related side effects were recorded. Cumulative incidence (CI) of 100-day grade II-IV acute GvHD was 18.9% vs 15.9% (p=0.77) and CI of 1-year chronic GvHD was 6.9% vs 5.7% (p=0.56) in abTCD-haplo-HSCT and abTCD-haplo-HSCT+rivogenlecleucel, respectively. The 4-year non-relapse-mortality (NRM) was significantly lower in abTCD-haplo-HSCT+rivogenlecleucel (1.4% vs 8%, p=0.05) (Figure 1). There was no statistically significant difference in the 4-year CI of relapse (RI) (17% vs. 25%, p=0.30), respectively. Disease recurrence was the most common causes of death in both groups, viral and fungal infections being the most frequent non-relapse fatalities. The 4-year overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 70% vs 87%, p=0.01 (Figure 2) and 67% vs 82%, p=0.05, for abTCD-haplo-HSCT and abTCD-haplo-HSCT+rivogenlecleucel, respectively. There was no difference in 4-year CI of CMV reactivation between the 2 groups (p=0.68), median time to CMV reactivation being 29 and 30 days (p=0.29), respectively. Once infused, rivogenlecleucel expanded (mainly in the CD8+ subset), reaching a peak at 9 months after infusion. At 6-months, median CD3+, CD3/CD4, CD3/CD8, CD3-/CD56 and CD20/CD19 count/microL were 820, 265, 225, 141, 171, for abTCD-haplo-HSCT and 898, 294, 288, 214, and 161 for abTCD-haplo-HSCT+rivogenlecleucel, (p=ns, p=ns, p=0.02, p=0.03, p=ns), respectively. The advantage in the recovery of CD3/CD8 and CD3-/CD56 after abTCD-haplo-HSCT+rivogenlecleucel persisted at 1 year (p=0.01, p=0.03, respectively). In multivariable analysis, abTCD-haplo-HSCT+rivogenlecleucel was associated with better OS (HR 0.27, p=0.003) and LFS (HR 0.40, p=0.001); there was also a trend for lower relapse risk (HR 0.50, p=0.098). Age below the median value at HSCT (HR 2.62, p=0.01), CR1 at HSCT (HR 0.35, p=0.03) and use of irradiation in the conditioning regimen (HR 0.32, p=0.02) were other factors correlating with OS and LFS. Conclusions: These data confirm that the infusion of donor-derived rivogenlecleucel is safe and well tolerated. Rivogenlecleucel cells infusion contributed to enhance recovery of cytotoxic T and NK cells, improving patients NRM and OS/LFS. Rivogenlecleucel (with the possibility of inducing apoptosis of donor T cells) may facilitate the cellular therapy approaches aimed at optimizing immune recovery after HSCT.
