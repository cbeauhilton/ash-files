    "abstract_text": "Background Der(1;7)(q10;p10) (der(1;7) is an unbalanced translocation recurrently found in myeloid neoplasms, particularly in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and related disorders. Caused by a recombination between two homologous alphoid sequencing D1Z7 and D7Z1 on chromosomes 1 and 7, respectively, it results in monosomy 7q and trisomy 1q, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of der(1;7)-positive myeloid neoplasms. Previous studies reported frequent co-occurrence of +8 and del(20q), as well as RUNX1 mutations, the genetic and clinical characteristics of this abnormality has not fully been elucidated. Methods In this study, we enrolled a total of 153 cases myeloid neoplasms positive for der(1;7) from Japanese and German cohorts, in which co-occurring genetic lesions were analyzed using whole exome and/or targeted-capture sequencing. An additional 3,223 MDS and related neoplasm cases were also analyzed using targeted-capture sequencing to identify der(1;7)-specific genomic features. Results Ethnicity was evaluated comparing the frequency of der(1;7) in 944 German MDS cases and 763 Japanese MDS cases. Der(1;7) cases were observed at a higher frequency in Japanese MDS cohort compared to German MDS cohort (73/763 cases versus 4/944 cases, p < 0.00001). Der(1;7) cases showed a strong male predominance (86.3%) (p<0.001). Of 153 myeloid neoplasm patients harboring der(1;7), 114 were diagnosed with MDS, 28 with AML, 5 with MDS-MPN and 1 with MPN. Targeted-capture sequencing revealed mutations in common myeloid drivers (n=61) in 96% of der(1;7) cases. The most frequently mutated gene was RUNX1 with 46%, followed by ETNK1 (24.5%) and EZH2 (24.5%). Of interest, ETNK1 mutation was identified as the most unique to der(1;7) when compared to myeloid neoplasm cases without der(1;7) (n=3,066) [odds ratio (OR)=15.06], followed by ETV6 (OR=9.35) and EZH2 (OR=6.52). To further examine the uniqueness of this mutation profile, the mutational profile of der(1;7) was compared to those myeloid neoplasm cases harboring amp(1q) (n=52) and monosomy 7 (n=105). Highly frequent ETV6 and ETNK1 mutations were highly unique to der(1;7) cases when compared to amp(1q) cases (OR=3.72, OR=2.57, respectively). BCOR and ETNK1 mutations were highly unique to der(1;7) cases when compared to monosomy 7 cases (OR=35.88, OR=4.29, respectively). Both amp(1q) and monosomy 7 cases showed a higher mutation rate in TP53 compared to der(1;7) cases (49.1% and 51%, respectively, vs 3.5 %) . From these mutational characteristics, ETNK1 was identified as being the most unique to der(1;7) when compared to amp(1q), monosomy 7 and other myeloid neoplasm cases. ETNK1 -mutated der(1;7) cases were featured with eosinophilia (p < 0.0005), a lack of RAS pathway mutations and trisomy 8 when compared to ETNK1 -wild type der(1;7) cases. Survival analysis was conducted to elucidate the difference in survival in der(1;7) cases (n=65) versus myeloid neoplasm cases (n=2066). Der(1;7)-harboring myeloid neoplasm cases had a median overall survival of 6.8 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 11.9) and non-der(1;7) harboring myeloid neoplasm cases were 11.8 months (95% CI, 10.5 to 12.6). Thus, der(1;7)-harboring myeloid neoplasm cases had poorer prognosis (p<0.001). Conclusion In conclusion, der(1;7) is an unbalanced translocation that occurs predominantly in males and is seen more frequently in Japanese than Caucasian populations. Der(1;7) cases present with a mutational profile that is distinct from other myeloid neoplasm cases such as those with amp(1q) and monosomy7/del(7q), showing frequency of ETNK1 mutations.
