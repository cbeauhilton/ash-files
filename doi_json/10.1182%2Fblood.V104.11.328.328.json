    "abstract_text": "Platelet \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin undergoes extensive structural rearrangement upon activation. Crystallographic and high-resolution electron microscopic observation revealed that integrins could assume multiple conformers under physiological conditions. However, functional assignment of each conformer has not been clearly determined. It is postulated that transition from the bent to the extended conformer (switchblade-like movement) and widening of the angle between the \u03b2A and the \u03b2 hybrid domains (swing-out of the hybrid domain) that accompanies the extension is the critical event for integrin activation. To examine the authenticity of this hypothesis, we created and characterized mutant \u03b1IIb\u03b23 of which conformation was fixed in a specific conformer with an artificially introduced disulfide bridge. A double cysteine mutation \u03b2V332C/\u03b2S674C was designed to ligate \u03b2A and \u03b2TD, thus it is expected to fix integrin in a bent conformer by stabilizing the \u03b2A/\u03b2TD interface. Another mutation \u03b1D319C/\u03b2V359C was designed to ligate \u03b1 \u03b2-propeller and the \u03b2 hybrid domains. This mutation is expected to prevent the swing-out of the hybrid domain and the possible \u03b1/\u03b2 headpiece dissociation. When expressed in CHO cells, both mutants were unable to bind fibrinogen, unless the disulfide bridge had been disrupted by DTT treatment. The LIBS epitope expression in \u03b2V332C/\u03b2S674C was significantly impaired and did not respond to induction by RGD peptide. The binding of ligand-mimetic mAb OP-G2 was also significantly impaired. By contrast, \u03b1D319C/\u03b2V359C showed comparable LIBS epitope expression and OP-G2 binding as wild-type \u03b1IIb\u03b23. The RGD peptide induced LIBS epitope expression, albeit slightly weaker than wild-type. Consistently, the \u03b2G327C/\u03b2V419C mutation that was designed to ligate \u03b2A and \u03b2 hybrid domains, thus fix integrin headpiece in closed conformer by preventing the swing-out of the hybrid domain without affecting the \u03b1/\u03b2 head interface, specifically blocked fibrinogen binding without affecting the binding of anti-LIBS or OP-G2. These results indicate that \u03b2V332C/\u03b2S674C is absolutely inactive and incapable of undergoing structural rearrangements associated with activation, while the \u03b1D319C/\u03b2V359C and \u03b2G327C/\u03b2V419C are capable of doing so upon binding to ligand-mimetic RGD peptide. Disruption of the \u03b2A/\u03b2TD interface by introducing a bulky amino acid residue in the interface or by deletion of the CD loop in the \u03b2TD did not induce integrin activation. However, introducing a bulky N-glycan at \u03b2V332 or at \u03b2S674 in the \u03b2A/\u03b2TD interface significantly potentiated ligand binding. Notably, the effects of the two N-glycans were synergistic. In summary, these results suggest, 1) that the bent conformer represents an inactive conformer, 2) that the contribution of the putative \u03b2A/\u03b2TD interface interaction in restraining integrin in the bent conformer is minimal, 3) that increasing the distance between the \u03b2A and the \u03b2TD, i.e. decreasing the angle of the bend, makes integrin highly susceptible to activation, 4) integrin with closed headpiece represents low affinity conformer, but it is capable of undergoing structural rearrangement upon ligand binding. Taken together, our results are consistent with the switchblade model. Conformational change other than the swing-out of the hybrid domain may trigger the structural rearrangement from bent to extended conformer upon ligand binding.",
