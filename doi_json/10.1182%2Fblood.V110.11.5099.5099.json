    "abstract_text": "Background: Therapy-related MDS/AML (t-MDS/AML) is a common and devastating complication of treatment with alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors, often employed with curative intent, in standard or high-doses, in the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Allogeneic HSC transplant is considered the standard treatment for t-MDS/AML but its applicability is limited by the unavailability of donors, comorbidities in the recipient and risk of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease. Patients carrying diseases commonly treated with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous HSC transplant (such as multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma) who latter develop t-MDS/AML occasionally have stored HSC harvested prior to the diagnosis of the secondary malignancy (hereafter called early-stored HSC). The benefit of using early-stored HSC to support myeloablative therapy for the treatment t-MDS/AML is unknown. Methods: Retrospective, single center analysis of patients with t-MDS/AML receiving myeloablative chemotherapy with or without irradiation supported with early-stored HSC. Results: Six patients received early-stored HSC transplant for treatment of t-MDS/AML between 2000 and 2007. Median age at the time of the transplant was 57 years (range 15\u201371). Three patients had been primarily diagnosed with follicular lymphoma, 2 with multiple myeloma and 1 with Ewing\u2019s sarcoma. One patient had received prior autologous HSC transplantation. Two patients developed AML, 1 patient CMML, 1 patient RCMD, 1 patient RAEB1 and 1 patient RAEB2. Median time from diagnosis of primary malignancy to HSC harvesting was 26 (2\u2013122) months and from harvesting to development of t-MDS/AML 44 (7\u201379) months. Conditioning regimen was Cy/TBI in three patients, BuCy in 2 patients and Samarium + Melphalan in one patient. Five patients engrafted neutrophils and 4 patients engrafted platelets 10\u201334 and 13\u2013126 days after transplant respectively. In 3/6 patients there was disappearance of the pre-transplant chromosomic abnormality (2 patients -7 and 1 patient -7 and t(1;7)). Two patients obtained hematologic CR and two patients obtained CR without full recovery of platelets. One patient died of sepsis 230 days after transplant, one died with refractory disease on day 103 after transplant and one patient is alive with recurrence of t-MDS. Three patients are alive and free of disease 7, 73 and 87 months after transplant. Conclusion: Myeloablative conditioning followed by autologous, early-stored HSC transplant can provide prolonged survival to patients with tMDS/AML not suitable to allogeneic SCT.",
