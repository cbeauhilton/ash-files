    "abstract_text": "TWIST1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, plays a critical role in mesodermal development and organogenesis. Overexpressed TWIST1 has been thoroughly related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in solid tumors (QIN Q et al., 2012) and has been described as an emerging risk factor in hematological neoplasms (MERINDOL et al., 2014). . Many questions remain to be addressed concerning to the role of TWIST1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The understanding of TWIST1 in leukemia cells and its interaction with microenvironment can offer new insights in regards to disease biology and therapeutic targets for patients with AML. Objectives: 1) to evaluate the role of stroma contact and hypoxia in TWIST1 expression in myeloid cell lines. 2) To evaluate the functional impact of overexpressing TWIST1 on KG1a and PL21 cells. 3) To evaluate TWIST1 expression in primary cells of AML patients. Methods: In order to mimic bone marrow microenvironment, myeloid cells were co-cultured with mesenchymal HS5 cell line and PO 2 1% was established with Smart -Trak\u00a8 2 (Sierra Instruments, Inc.) equipment. Quantitative mRNA was determined using TaqMan\u00a8 Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and 3-step standard cycling conditions with sequence-specific primer TWIST1 normalized to the expression of \u03b2-actin. KG1a and PL21 cells were transduced with lentivirus vector carrying e-GFP (\"enhanced green fluorescence protein\") for stable expression of TWIST1. Transduced cells were sorted by FITC fluorochrome and then verified through western blot analysis with TWIST1 antibody. For quantification of apoptosis, cells were labeled with PE-conjugated antibody using annexin V-phycoerythrin and propidium iodide (BD Biosciences, USA). DAPI (4',6- diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride) was used to stain DNA and determine cell cycle information . Apoptosis and cell cycle were analyzed by FACS -Becton Dickinson Canto II (BD Biosciences). Statistical analysis was assessed with unpaired t test. Results: Hypoxia induced TWIST1 mRNA expression in OCIAML3, PL21, KG1a and ML1 cell lines (fold-increased 46.3, 29.8, 12.9 and 2.3 respectively). Cells expressing endogenous TWIST1 protein (OCIAML3 and ML1) showed resistance to apoptosis in a hypoxic microenvironment (normoxia versus hypoxia: OCI/AML3, 22.6 % vs 11.7% and ML1, 29.8% vs. 7.5%) in contrast, cells not expressing endogenous TWIST1 protein (KG1a and PL21) went to apoptosis in the same conditions. Thus, overexpressing TWIST1 in KG1a and PL21 induced apoptosis protection in hypoxia (KG1a unmodified vs. modified: 17.6 \u00b1 6.3 vs. 2.8 \u00b1 6.3, p=0.04; PL21 unmodified vs. modified: 26.9 \u00b1 10.9 vs. 3.2 \u00b1 0.6, p=0.04) (fig 1). We found increased TWIST1 mRNA levels in bone marrow samples of 23 AML patients (3.88 \u00b1 1.59) compared with 5 healthy controls (0.54 \u00b10.25) (p= 0.02) (fig 2). Patients in the highest tertile of TWIST1 expression did not show differences in percentage of blasts in bone marrow and complete remission after treatment compared with patients in low and middle tertile. Conclusion: Our data suggest TWIST1 gene expression protects acute myeloid leukemia cells from apoptosis in a hypoxic microenvironment. Moreover, our results showed increased expression of TWIST1 in AML patients. Thus, TWIST1 is a potential gene involved in leukemogenesis and should be further explored to understand disease biology and potential therapeutic targets.
