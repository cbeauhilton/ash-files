    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Familial Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (FHLH) is an autosomal recessive disease affecting young children. It manifests itself as a severe hyperinflammatory syndrome with activated macrophages and T-lymphocytes. Mutations in Perforin ( PRF1 ) are responsible for FHL-2 in about 15 to 50 % of the patients. Defective granule exocytosis due to mutations in UNC13D have recently been described as the genetic defect underlying FHL-3. Both types are phenotypically not distinguishable from one another. Patients and Methods: Genetic analysis was performed in either the 2 or the 32 exons of PRF1 and UNC-13D , respectively, in 61 patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) of different geographic origin (28 from Germany, 24 from Turkey and 9 from other countries). Results: We identified mutations in 28 samples investigated (18 in PRF1 , 10 in UNC-13D ). Besides several known mutations novel deletions, missense and nonsense mutations were detected in both genes scattering the whole coding regions. The Trp374stop mutation (11/13 patients with a PRF1 mutation from Turkey) was the only single mutation repeatedly observed in several patients with a common geographic origin. In HLH patients from Germany, 7/28 patients showed homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in either PRF1 (3) or UNC13D (4). In 24 HLH patients from Turkey 13 patients with a mutation in PRF1 and 4 patients with a mutation in UNC13D were identified. In addition, four out of 9 patients with a different geographic origin showed mutations in one of this genes. In 10 patients only one heterozygous mutation in UNC13D was detected so far. In these cases, control samples or regulatory regions of the gene have to be analysed to ascertain the relevance of the underlying mutation.  Defect . Turkey . German . Other . All .

Our results indicate that FHL-2 and FHL-3 account for more than 60% of the HLH cases of Turkish origin with only a small number involving UNC-13D. In contrast, gene defects were identified in only 25% of the patients with a German ancestry. This work was supported by the Foerdergemeinschaft Kinderkrebszentrum Hamburg e. V.",
