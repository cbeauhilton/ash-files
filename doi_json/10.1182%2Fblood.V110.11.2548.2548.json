    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the prognostic relevance of aberrant serum lipid values in the myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) of primary myelofibrosis (PMF), polycythemia vera (PV), and essential thrombocythemia (ET). METHODS: The Mayo MPD patient institutional database was queried to identify clinical history and lipid profiles (within a year of diagnosis). Serum cholesterol (CHOL), low density lipoprotein (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TRI) were assessed compared to clinical outcomes. RESULTS: 558 patients with MPDs (PMF 28%, PV 27%, and ET 45%) (median age at diagnosis of 56 (range18\u201381)) were identified. A lipid profile obtained a median of 0.0 months from diagnosis (range (-8 to 12 months) from MPD patients displayed low CHOL, LDL-C, and higher HDL-C than typical for the USA. Amongst MPD disease types PMF patients had lower CHOL (p<0.001) and HDL (p<0.001) compared to ET and PV (see table). Amongst PMF patients, although hypocholesterolemia was not a surrogate for malnutrition (p=0.13) median serum albumin 4.1 g/dL (range 2.7\u20134.8)), there was correlation with the presence of weight loss, hypercatabolic symptoms, and worse Mayo-CBC myelofibrosis prognostic scores ( Cancer  2006 ; 106 : 623 ; p<0.01). Amongst the study group PMF patients had the poorest survival (followed by PV then ET; p<0.001). Decreased cholesterol (CHOL <150mg/dL, or HDL <60 mg/dL) was associated with decreased survival (P<0.001), but only in PMF patients (see figure). Decreased PMF survival was also associated with traditional PMF risk factors of hemoglobin 30 \u00d7 10(9)/L, platelets <100 \u00d7 10(9)/L, and circulating blasts. In multivariate analysis (Cox-Proportional Hazard) only the Mayo-CBC score, hemoglobin <10g/dL, circulating blasts and decreased CHOL remained significant for decreased survival (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of hypocholesterolemia is very common in patients with PMF and is independently associated with inferior survival.
