    "abstract_text": "Backgroud: An increasing number of bacterial and viral infections have been linked with specific subtypes of lymphoma. Preliminary evidence suggests that hepatitis C virus (HCV) might play a pathogenetic role in autoimmune-related, non-malignant B-cell lymphoproliferation, as well as a subset of B-cell non-Hodgkin, s lymphomas (B-NHL), often with extranodal localization. Design and methods: The study was conducted in the Department of Hematology and consisted 149 (86 male, 63 female) untreated patients with a new diagnosis of B-NHL for 5-years period (2000\u20132004). HCV infection was investigated by testing for HCV antibodies in serum samples. The controls were 587 patients (without intravenous drug users) in other departments of the same hospital. Results: HCV infection was documented in 13 cases (8,4%) with NHL. The infected patients were not clinically relevant cryoglobulinemic activity, increased rate of autoimmune disorders and extranodal localizations prevalence. There was statistically significant difference between the NHL and control group (p0,05) into the NHL group. Overall, the clinical outcome of HCV-positive NHL does not seem to be different from that of NHL patients without HCV infection. However, the evidence of a significant liver injury may predict a worse prognosis in these cases. Conclusions: Our date suggest that HCV infection may be associated with B-NHL. With regard to the mechanism(s) by which HCV might favor B-cell expansion and malignant transformation, most date support an indirect pathogenetic role of the virus as an exogenous trigger. A direct oncogenetic role of HCV by direct cell infection and deregulation has only been hypothesized on the basis of the lymphotropism of the virus.",
