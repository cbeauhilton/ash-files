    "abstract_text": "Background: About two-thirds of AML patients harbor mutations in signaling and kinase pathways (e.g., FLT3, KRAS, NRAS, PTPN11, NF1, KIT), which utilize the growth factor receptor bound protein-2 (Grb2) to induce AML progression. Prexigebersen (BP1001), a liposome-incorporated Grb2 antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits Grb2 expression, suppresses cancer growth and survival. A Phase I/IB single center study (Ohanian, Lancet Haematol 2018) in relapsed/refractory AML patients demonstrated BP1001 safety up to 90 mg/m 2 and demonstrated CR/CRi in 3 of 6 relapsed/refractory AML patients treated with BP1001 + low dose cytarabine combination in the Phase IB portion. Preclinical studies indicated that BP1001 enhanced the inhibitory effects of decitabine (DAC), or DAC + venetoclax (VEN) against AML cells. Thus, we designed a clinical trial with three treatment arms: (1) BP1001 + DAC + VEN for newly diagnosed AML, (2) BP1001 + DAC + VEN for relapsed/refractory AML, (3) BP1001 + DAC for relapsed/refractory AML patients who are VEN-resistant or -intolerant [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02781883]. The study was amended to obtain safety run-in data for patients treated with BP1001 + DAC first before proceeding to safety run-in for patients treated with BP1001 + DAC + VEN. Here we report the safety run-in and efficacy data of AML patients treated with BP1001 + DAC or BP1001 + DAC + VEN. Methods: This is a multi-center open-label, Phase II study in newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory AML patients to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of BP1001 (given at 60 mg/m 2 over 2-3 h twice weekly for a total of 8 doses over a 28-day cycle) in combination with DAC (20 mg/m 2 , once daily for 5 days) or in combination with DAC and VEN (400 mg, once daily). Eligible patients were considered unsuitable for or refused intensive chemotherapy and had ECOG performance status of 0-2. Patients treated with at least 1 cycle of therapy were evaluable for safety run-in. Results: Between April 2018 and May 2020, 6 patients (4 male: 67%) with median age 72 years (range, 51 - 76) were treated with at least 1 cycle of BP1001 + DAC combination therapy. Four patients (67%) had de novo AML and two (33%) had secondary AML. All patients in this cohort were considered high risk due to having either adverse risk status by ELN (n=5) or treated secondary AML (n=1) (transformed from myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm after failing 4 lines of prior therapy). Adverse events (AEs) were generally consistent with those expected with DAC and/or AML and included diarrhea (67%), fatigue (50%), constipation (50%), nausea (50%), dyspnea (50%), hypoxia (50%), hypotension (50%) and pain in extremity (50%). The most frequent serious AE (SAE) was bacteremia (33%). Two de novo patients (33%) achieved a CRi and 1 treated secondary AML patient (17%) achieved a PR. Patients received a median of 2.5 cycles of therapy (range, 1 - 6); median duration of follow-up was 140 days (range, 72 - 678). Since May 2020, 6 patients (2 male: 33%) with median age 61 years (range, 44 - 81) were treated with at least 1 cycle of BP1001 + DAC + VEN combination therapy. Two (33%) had de novo AML, and four (67%) were relapsed/refractory. All patients in this cohort were adverse-risk by ELN (n=2) or relapsed/refractory (n=4). AEs were generally as expected with DAC, VEN and/or AML, including fatigue (67%), diarrhea (67%), constipation (67%), decreased appetite (67%), hypokalemia (67%), hypocalcemia (50%), edema peripheral (50%), asthenia (50%), nausea (50%), abdominal pain (50%), dysphagia (50%), hypotension (50%) and febrile neutropenia (50%). The most frequent SAEs were sepsis (33%) and febrile neutropenia (50%). Four patients (67%) achieved a CR/CRi/MLFS (n=1/2/1) and 1 (17%) achieved a PR. Of these patients, 3 were relapsed/refractory (1 CR/1 CRi/1 MLFS) and two were de novo (1 CRi/1 PR). Patients received a median of 4 cycles of therapy (range, 1 - 9); median duration of follow-up was 177 days (range, 113 - 318). Conclusions: BP1001-based combination therapy has been safely administered to high-risk and relapsed/refractory AML patients who were considered unsuitable for standard chemotherapy. Preliminary data showed the combination treatment of BP1001 + DAC or BP1001 + DAC + VEN was well-tolerated, with encouraging efficacy signals. The study will continue enrollment across all three cohorts. Drug dosing for the study will proceed as planned.
