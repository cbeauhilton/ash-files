    "abstract_text": "Approximately 75% of patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) harbour mutations in PTPN11 , NF1 and RAS genes. The remaining cases presumably carry somatic mutations in other genes in the RAS pathway. BRAF plays a central role in this pathway between RAS and downstream molecules including MEK and ERK. BRAF mutations frequently occur in cancer. Recently, BRAF mutations were found in leukemia. Besides that, germline BRAF mutations cause cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, which shares many features with Noonan syndrome (NS). NS predisposes to a myeloproliferative disease resembling JMML. In 65 JMML patients screening for V600E mutations in exon 15 of the BRAF gene was performed from mononuclear cells. In a subset of patients, without RAS or PTPN11 mutations, and no clinical signs of NF1, the entire coding sequence of BRAF was analyzed. Sequence analysis was performed by direct, bidirectional sequencing of purified polymerase chain reaction products. In none of the 65 cases a V600E mutation of the BRAF gene was found. In a subset of patients in which the entire coding sequence of BRAF was analyzed, no mutations were identified either. Mutant proteins of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway play an important role in the pathogenesis of JMML, resulting in GM-CSF hypersensitivity. In about 75% of the JMML cases these mutations affect RAS , NF1 or PTPN11 genes. The hypothesis for this study was that BRAF might play an important role in JMML as it is an important downstream effector of RAS. Our data show that apparently BRAF mutations do not play a role in JMML. Therefore, additional analysis of genes of the RAS pathway will be necessary to identify genetic aberrations in cases without known mutations.",
