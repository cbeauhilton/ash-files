    "abstract_text": "Poorly differentiated aggressive myeloid diseases such as Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) and blast crisis Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (bcCML) are often resistant to standard therapy and associated with significantly poor survival in both children and adults. There is thus a significant need for a better understanding of the mechanisms that drive disease progression and for finding novel therapeutic targets. Thus, to determine the molecular effectors of myeloid leukemia growth in vivo , we carried out a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 dropout screen using the lentiviral Brie gRNA library. This library targets 19,674 genes, and has on average 3 gRNAs for each gene, and 1000 control non-targeting gRNAs. We carried out this whole-genome screen in a mouse model of Cas9 + blast crisis CML (bcCML) driven by BCR-ABL/ NUP98-HOXA9 since this represents a very aggressive phase of myeloid cancer where 90% of the leukemic blasts are undifferentiated and cancer stem cell-like. This in vivo screen led to the identification of 3636 genes essential for leukemic growth and propagation in the bone marrow of recipient mice, constituting pathways such as metabolism, protein translation and DNA replication. The genes that were significantly depleted included known drivers of myeloid cancer progression and regulators of myeloid cancer stem cells (for example, Brd4 , Kdm1a , Pafah1b1/Lis1 , Rptor ), indicating that our screening strategy can successfully identify functional drivers of cancer growth. While intrinsic signals that drive myeloid cancer progression are well described, little is known about how interactions with the surrounding microenvironment can control leukemic growth and propagation. Our whole-genome screen identified ~130 cell surface genes that are significantly depleted in the bcCML stem cells transplanted in vivo . Since environmental factors commonly signal through receptors on the surface of leukemic cells, this subset is likely to include most, if not all, genetic effectors of niche driven signals required for in vivo growth and propagation of aggressive myeloid leukemia cells. Of these 130 genes, several have earlier been shown by us and others to be essential for myeloid cancer progression including Itgb1, Cxcr4 and Cd44 . We are currently testing the functional contribution of novel candidate cell surface molecules, which can integrate signals from the environment, on the in vivo growth and progression of myeloid malignancies. We anticipate that these studies will provide a basis for testing antibody-mediated therapeutic inhibition of specific microenvironmental signals on myeloid leukemia growth and propagation.
