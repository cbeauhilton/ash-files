    "abstract_text": "Mouse mutagenesis using forward genetics is valuable as a gene function discovery tool. We are looking for blood defects in a large ENU mutagenesis screen, and have isolated many new mouse mutants that reveal new mechanisms in hematopoiesis. One mutant mouse strain, called redears, is an intriguing model of inflammatory disease and thrombocytopenia. Animals homozygous for the redears ( rd ) mutation develop spontaneous inflammatory lesions of the ears and tail characterized by neutrophil infiltration and peripheral neutrophila. Unexpectedly, blood platelet numbers are dramatically reduced in rd/rd animals. A thorough analysis of platelet biogenesis shows that the platelet precursor cell, the megakaryocyte, undergoes abnormal maturation, which results in gross morphological abnormalities, increased ploidy and abortive platelet shedding. Here we report a mutation in a novel gene related to the yeast actin-interacting protein Aip1 in rd/rd mice. In yeast, Aip1 interacts with, and increases the activity of cofilin, a key regulator of actin depolymerization. Our data confirm that actin dynamics are dysregulated in rd/rd megakaryocytes and neutrophils. The massive cytoplasmic reorganization that is required for megakaryocyte maturation and platelet shedding has long been assumed to depend on the actin cytoskeleton. Intriguingly, recent studies suggest the process is caspase-dependent, and represents a form of \u2018para-apoptosis\u2019. With this in mind, we found that chemotaxis and apoptosis are perturbed in rd/rd neutrophils, suggesting that neutrophils are playing a key role in driving the inflammation. Disrupted actin depolymerization would provide an explanation for chemotactic deficiencies. Further, recent evidence implicating cofilin and other actin regulators in the initiation of apoptosis would suggest that this novel protein may play an essential role in neutrophil cell death. Thus, the redears mouse not only provides the first in vivo demonstration of the critical role of the actin cytoskeleton in megakaryocyte development and platelet production, but also represents a unique reagent to examine the relationship between actin dynamics, cellular maturation, inflammation and apoptosis. Our ongoing mutagenesis efforts continue to reveal new developmental mechanisms. New mutants, genetic tools, and resources can be found at www.mouse-genome.bcm.tmc.edu"
