    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2530 Heparin is the anticoagulant used when performing low density lipoprotein (LDL)-apheresis using the Liposorber\u00ae system for patients with hypercholesterolemia. This system removes LDL particles via adsorption to a dextran sulfate cellulose bead column (LA-15 column). Despite the exposure to large amounts of heparin and the predisposition of patients with vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis to heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), HIT in patients undergoing LDL-apheresis is very rare. We, therefore, investigated the possibility that the LDL apheresis procedure decreases platelet factor 4 (PF4) adsorbed to cell surfaces and/or plasma HIT antibody levels, either of which would disfavor HIT. We enrolled 25 patients undergoing LDL apheresis (Liposorber\u00ae) in the Apheresis and Infusion Clinic at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Patients were 28\u201377 years old with high levels of LDL-cholesterol or Lp(a). Whole blood samples were drawn before (pre-treatment), immediately after (post-treatment), and 30 minutes after treatment (30' post-treatment). Plasma samples were also drawn proximal (pre-column) and distal (post-column) to the LA-15 column after \u223c350-500ml (\u223c15-30 minutes) of plasma volume had been processed. PF4, anti-PF4-heparin complex (HIT) antibodies and soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L; as a marker of platelet activation) were measured using ELISA. Serotonin release assay was performed on samples that were positive for HIT antibodies. Platelet surface PF4 and P-selectin were measured by flow cytometry. Heparin levels were measured using the heparin anti-Xa chromogenic assay. The Student's t test, ANOVA and Wald tests were used to compare results. There were more males than females. None of the patients had any clinical symptoms of HIT. The LA-15 column was found to efficiently remove PF4 (pre-column mean \u00b1 SD=133.8 \u00b1 88.26 IU/ml, post-column mean \u00b1 SD=0 IU/ml; P<0.0001, 2-tailed). The PF4 level in peripheral blood plasma did not change significantly after LDL apheresis (pre-treatment mean \u00b1 SD=116.5 \u00b1 79.14 IU/ml, post-treatment mean \u00b1 SD=110.8 \u00b1 67.28 IU/ml; P=NS). However, the amount of PF4 on the platelet surface was significantly decreased by LDL apheresis (pre-treatment mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) mean \u00b1 SD=46.32 \u00b1 20.98, post-treatment MFI mean \u00b1 SD=31.37 \u00b1 10.11, 30' post-treatment MFI mean \u00b1 SD=29.83 \u00b1 10.35; P<0.001 for pre-treatment vs post-treatment and pre-treatment vs 30'post-treatment, 2-tailed). Heparin concentration in the plasma sample increased during treatment and remained elevated 30 minutes after treatment ended (pre-treatment mean \u00b1 SD=0.05 \u00b1 0.10 U/ml, post-treatment mean \u00b1 SD=0.89 \u00b1 0.09 U/ml, 30'post-treatment mean \u00b1 SD=0.79 \u00b1 0.17 U/ml, P<0.0001 for pre-treatment vs post-treatment and pre-treatment vs 30'post-treatment, 2-tailed). HIT antibodies were found in only 2 patients and these antibodies were nonfunctional as assessed by the serotonin release assay. Platelet surface P-selectin, a marker of platelet activation, did not change during treatment (pre-treatment MFI mean \u00b1 SD=49.07 \u00b1 27.24, post-treatment MFI mean \u00b1 SD=45.14 \u00b1 25.77; P=NS) nor did sCD40L levels which were low before and after treatment. These data provide a potential explanation for the near lack of HIT in hypercholesterolemic patients undergoing LDL apheresis. They also suggest the possibility that the Liposorber\u00ae system (or the dextran sulfate adsorption column) may be useful for lowering PF4 in patients with HIT and may have therapeutic potential in its treatment as surface-bound PF4 is the pathologic target of HIT antibodies.
