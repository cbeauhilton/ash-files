    "abstract_text": "Background VMP regimen for newly diagnosed myeloma patients is well-documented treatment. However patients in real practice generally have worse performance status and less attention than those in clinical trials. Thus we conducted observational study to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of VMP treatment in newly diagnosed Korean myeloma patients. Patients and Methods Data were prospectively collected from 39 hospitals. One hundred seventy three patients who started VMP as first line from 2011 May to 2012 April were included for analysis. Results Median age was 71 and 22.5% were more than 75 years old. Fifty-seven per cent were male sex. IgG type was most common (61.9%) and IgA 24.9%. ISS stage I was 13.8% and III was 51.5%. Patients with high risk FISH (Del17p, t(4;14), and t(4;16)) were 4.1%, 4.1%, and 2.3% respectively. Dose and schedule was followed original VISTA trial except for use of prednisolone instead of prednisone. Median 5cycles (range 1-9) were given and 105 patients stopped in the course of treatment. Most common cause were adverse event (28.8%) followed by disease progression or no response (19.6%). Twenty-five mortality cases were reported and 22 were in the course of treatment. The most common cause of mortality was infection (61%) followed by disease progression (13%). Overall response rate was 72.3% and response more than VGPR was 37.6%. Median progression free survival is 455 days and median OS was 504 days. One year PFS was 80.9 % and one year OS was 83.4%. Most common toxicity was cytopenia, peripheral neuropathy, and gastrointestinal toxicities such as nausea and diarrhea. Peripheral neuropathy of all grade and grade 3 or more was 58.6% and 6.36%, respectively Discussions Even though patients with higher proportion of ISS stage, efficacy of VMP regimen was considerable in Korean patients. With relatively high mortality due to infection in the course of treatment prophylactic measures for infection need to be developed. To reduce the incidence of peripheral neuropathy, close observation and intervention are needed to prevent aggravation of neuropathy.
