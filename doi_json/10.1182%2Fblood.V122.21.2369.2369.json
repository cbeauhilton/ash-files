    "abstract_text": "Introduction Hereditary antithrombin (AT) deficiency is an autosomal dominant thrombophilia. It is classified into type 1 (quantitative) or type 2 (qualitative) deficiency based on the AT antigen and activity levels ( Haemophilia 2008:14; 1229 ). The goal of this study was to correlate clinical phenotype with AT molecular defects. Methods After IRB approval, patients with a diagnosis of hereditary AT deficiency established at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, were identified from the clinical database (1997-2012). AT activity was assayed by a chromogenic Factor Xa assay and AT antigen level was assayed by latex immunoassay. Peripheral blood leukocyte genomic DNA was extracted using standard methods. PCR-amplification and ABI BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit was performed for all SERPINC1 exons, intronic splicing regions and the 3\u2019UTR. SERPINC1 sequence was analyzed using Mutation Surveyor software (SoftGenetics). Clinical data were obtained from patient interview and medical record review. An event was defined as an episode of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism; arterial thrombosis, including cerebrovascular event and/or myocardial infarction, and an obstetric event, including miscarriages and/or spontaneous abortions. Statistical analysis was performed with SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC). Results Of 30 patients with hereditary AT deficiency; sequence data was available on 22. Twenty-nine (97%) patients were white, and 19 (63%) were females. Six patients (20%) were smokers and 9 (30%) had a body mass index of >30. Based on the AT activity and antigen levels, 18 (81%) had type 1 AT deficiency, while the remainder had type 2. Eleven patients were heterozygous for six novel (all type 1) mutations. One patient was also a homozygous carrier for the Factor V Leiden mutation. The median age at first thrombotic event was 24.4 years (range, 16.2-70.7), and the median age at diagnosis of AT deficiency was 40.7 years (range, 17.8-76). Both, the median ages at first thrombotic event and at diagnosis were comparable in type 1 versus type 2 AT deficiency patients (P=0.52 and 0.97 respectively). Thirteen patients (43%) had unprovoked thrombotic events. Majority had VTE (n=21, 70%), which included one patient each with splanchnic venous thrombosis, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. At last follow up, twenty-one patients (70%) were on chronic anticoagulation [17 (81%) were on warfarin, 2 (9.5%) on enoxaparin and 2 (9.5%) were on rivaroxaban]. Median number of events was 1 (range 0-7). Four patients (19%) had bleeding complications from anticoagulation. Only one death was noted in the cohort and cause of death could not be determined. Conclusions Type 1 hereditary AT deficiency is the most clinically prevalent subtype in practice. Of the patients who developed thrombosis; clinical characteristics did not differ between type 1 and type 2 AT deficiency. We report 6 novel mutations in patients with hereditary AT deficiency.
