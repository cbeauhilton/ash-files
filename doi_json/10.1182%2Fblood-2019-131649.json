    "abstract_text": "DEAD-Box helicase 41 ( DDX41 ) is one of the most commonly reported familial hematological malignancy (HM) genes, first reported in 2015. Mutated, it predisposes to both MDS/AML and lymphoma with an age of diagnosis similar to that of sporadic cases. Consequently, unrecognized DDX41 mutated cases are present in 'sporadic' cohorts with families often identified this way. Individuals with DDX41 mutation or deficiency have generally poor outcome with no effective targeted therapies available. The biological mechanism by which mutant DDX41 predisposes to HM is poorly understood making risk assessment for asymptomatic carriers difficult. In over 50% of HM affected individuals with germline DDX41 mutations, an acquired somatic mutation is identified on the other DDX41 allele with R525H being most common. Analysis of other somatic mutations in germline DDX41 mutation carriers reveals a minimal fingerprint of acquired somatic alterations in known myeloid malignancy driver genes with an absence of NPM1 and FLT3 mutations and an under-representation of mutations in DNMT3A , TET2 , IDH1/2 and RUNX1 . This may indicate a mechanism of leukemia development unique to germline DDX41 cases. Through an integrative combinatorial genomics approach of whole exome sequencing, leukemic panel sequencing and RNA-sequencing, we are in the process of comprehensively assessing six independent DDX41 germline mutated families. We and others have identified that DDX41 mutations are recurrently associated with MDS with erythroid dysplasia and erythroid subtype leukemia consistent with functional in vitro experiments showing that DDX41 mutations including loss-of-function can impact erythroid differentiation. Our preliminary RNA-Seq analysis on peripheral blood mononuclear cells of DDX41 carriers with HM reveals altered expression of genes involved in hemoglobin complex and innate immunity. DDX41 is reported to bind RNA splicing components such as SF3B1 and PRPF8 which are recurrently mutated in MDS/AML and intriguingly, the R525H mutation disrupts this interaction. Further analysis of our RNA-Seq data interrogating alternative splicing, gene expression analysis and biological pathways to uncover mechanisms for mutant DDX41 oncogenicity is currently ongoing. We have used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to generate Ddx41 M1I mice as a model for one of the most common germline mutations in familial HM to investigate the direct effect of DDX41 mutation on hematopoiesis. Preliminary results indicate a sub-clinical reduction in hemoglobin levels in mice carrying the M1I mutation in heterozygosity when compared to their wildtype littermates. We are further investigating these mice with particular emphasis on characterizing hematopoiesis longitudinally to better understand mechanisms of disease onset and progression. This integrative genomic and functional approach to evaluate both mutations and biological pathways affected in DDX41 mutated malignancies will provide biological insight facilitating advancement in diagnosis, risk assessment, monitoring and personalized treatment.
