    "abstract_text": "Previous studies have shown that anemia is frequently associated with higher morbidity and mortality in HF pts. Our aim was to determine the impact of anemia in pts hospitalized with congestive HF at our hospital. We analyzed data from 277 pts with diagnosis of HF admitted between 1 June 2004 and 31 December 2005, with a follow up of at least 6 months. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin (Hb) 1.9 mg/dl. Pts with HF were assigned to group A (with anemia) or B (control). Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson\u2019s Chi square, Spearman\u2019s rho, Fisher test and Kaplan Meyer survival function. Results: We evaluated 229 (82,7%) pts with a median follow up of 594 days (range: 1\u20131129 days). Mean age was 68,02 years (median 71, range: 17\u201391). 143/229 (62,4%) were male. In 75 /229 (32.75%) cases a Hb < 11,5 g/dl was measured at admission. The mean Hb was 13,1 g/dl for the entire group. Anemia pts showed a mean Hb of 10.6 g/dl. Demographic, clinical and outcome features are shown in table 1.Group A showed a higher number of readmissions because of HF and other cardiac. Conclussions: In our analysis the prevalence of anemia was 33% in pts hospitalized for HF. There was no significant differences among clinical variables between anemic and non-anemic pts. Anemia was associated with worse clinical outcome (Group A pts required more readmissions for HF and other cardiological causes)and all cause mortality. Mean survival was longer in Group B pts.according to Kaplan Meyer analysis. TABLE 1: RESULTS  . GROUP A (n=75) . GROUP B (n= 154) . p .
