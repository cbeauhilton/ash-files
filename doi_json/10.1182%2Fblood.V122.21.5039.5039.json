    "abstract_text": "Objectives Relapsed/refractory AML patients\u00a0 have a poor prognosis; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only chance in this setting to achieve long-term disease-free survival (1). It was previously established the activity of clofarabine plus cytarabine in AML relapse (clofarabine dosed once daily for 5 days with 40 mg/m2\u00a0 followed 4 hours later by ara-C at 1 g/m2 per day)(2).However, modifications of this combination in AML therapy of relapsed/refractory patients warrant further evaluation.\u00a0Therefore, our goal was to determine the efficacy and safety of clofarabine at lower dosage followed by\u00a0 cytarabine (Ara-C) in adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and to evaluate the capacity of this regimen as a bridge for HSCT. Methods Patients aged 18-65 years with refractory/relapsed AML were treated at the dose of clofarabine 30 mg/mq on days 1-5 and cytarabine 1000 mg/mq gg on days 1-5. We evaluated the complete remission rate (CRR), duration of remission (DOR) and overall survival (OS). Minimal residual disease (MRD) by molecular targeting was considered in all patients. Results Twenty-five (25) patients aged 29-64 years (median 47), who were fit for allogenetic HCT,\u00a0 received one cycle of 30 minutes infusion of\u00a0 clofarabine 30 mg/mq, followed 4 hours later by 3 hours infusion of\u00a0 intermediate dose cytarabine 1000 mg/mq\u00a0 days 1-5. Only in the first three patients this schedule was followed by gentuzumab. Nine (36%) patients had refractory disease (seven after one induction regimen, one after two previous regimes, one after a prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT);\u00a0 16 (64%) patients\u00a0 were in their first (12 patients) or second relapse (4 patients); among the 12 patients in first relapse, 5 were from an allogeneic stem cell transplant.\u00a0 Fourteen patients (56%) \u00a0achieved a complete remission (CR), seven (28%) was refractory and 4 (16%) died of treatment related mortality. Eleven (44%) patients\u00a0 underwent (9 in CR) to allogeneic transplants or DLI infusion (3 patients refractory, and 8 patients relapsed), only one\u00a0 patient underwent to autologous transplant. One patient, who was relapsed after prior HSCT, obtained a CR but he developed acute\u00a0 graft vs host disease after therapy\u00a0 and died in molecular CR*.\u00a0 Among all patients underwent HSCT after Clofa/Ara-c salvage, six patients (50%) are still alive and in complete remission, six patients (50%) died because of\u00a0 HSCT complications or AML relapse. The complete remission rate (CRR) was\u00a0 (56,00 %), the median\u00a0 Overall Survival\u00a0 was 5 months for all patients (range 1-38 M), 11 Months for those underwent to tranplantation and 1,5 Months for non transplanted group. Treatment was complicated by neutropenic fever (n=17), grade III-IV mucositis (n=2) , skin rush\u00a0 (n=4) grade II- III, hepatic transaminase elevations (n=2).\u00a0 Two (n=5) patient died before their disease status could be evaluated. Conclusions These preliminary results suggest that combination treatment with clofarabine 30 mg/mq and ARA-C 1000 mg/mq is effective in this particularly poor prognosis category of patients, resulting in an ORR very favorably,\u00a0 representing a potential \u201cbridge\u201d toward bone marrow transplant procedures (among the 14 patients who achieved a CR, twelve (85%) proceeded to HSCT, and six are still alive). The safety profile is acceptable in this relapsed/refractory population, and our results are very similar to previous regimes using higher clofarabine dosages. \u00a0More studies with this combination in adults are warranted.
