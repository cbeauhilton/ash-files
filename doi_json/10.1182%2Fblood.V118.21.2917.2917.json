    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2917 The inhibitory Fc receptor, Fc \u03b3RIIb, is expressed on plasma cells, controls their persistence in the bone marrow (BM) and their ability to produce serum Ig. Activation of Fc \u03b3RIIb leads to the phosphorylation of ITIM and recruitment of SH2-containing inositol 5'-phosphatase (SHIP) in plasma cells. Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) and ITIM provide the basis for two opposing signaling modules that duel for control of plasma cell activation. Fc \u03b3RIIb-mediated SHIP phosphorylation activates downstream ITAM or ITIM signaling. To determine whether multiple myeloma (MM) cells express Fc \u03b3RIIb, we performed immunohistochemical staining on bone marrow mononuclear cells from MM patients and controls. We found that not only CD20 + B cells expressed Fc \u03b3RIIb but more importantly CD138 + cells from MM patients also showed expression of this receptor. Next, we examined whether Fc \u03b3RIIb was present and expressed in CD138 + primary MM cells purified from fresh MM BM and the MM cell lines MM1s, RPMI8226, and U266 using PCR and RT-PCR on DNA and mRNA, respectively. We focused on the transmembrane domain of the Fc \u03b3RIIb gene with four primers from different parts of this domain since this portion plays a critical role in this receptor's function. The MM cell lines expressed different amounts of Fc \u03b3RIIb. Notably, we found that 17% (5/30) of MM patients showed absence of Fc \u03b3RIIb both using RT-PCR for mRNA and PCR for DNA. Moreover, use of these same primers on nonmalignant PBMCs from the MM patients also showed absence of this gene in the same five patients. As a result of these findings, we are currently sequencing Fc \u03b3RIIb in MM patients to determine if additional patients show mutational changes that affect the function of this receptor. We also further determined SHIP-1 phosphorylation using Western blot analysis since this protein mediates downstream signaling of Fc \u03b3RIIb. Following stimulation with Fc complexes, phosphorylation of SHIP-1 was markedly reduced in MM tumor cells compared to normal CD20 + B cells. Interestingly, the patients with missing Fc \u03b3RIIb expressed higher levels of SHIP-1 gene expression compared to patients with normal Fc \u03b3RIIb expression. We investigated the IgG-binding ability of MM patients (n=33) and normal donors (n=33) to Fc \u03b3RIIb. Each serum sample was incubated with cells from MHC1, a cell line that specifically expresses Fc \u03b3RIIb but not Fc \u03b3RI and Fc \u03b3RIIa. The results showed MM patients' serum IgG have much lower Fc \u03b3RIIb-binding ability than normal human IgG (P<0.05) by using both flow cytometric and immunofluorescence assays . Our findings suggest that the monoclonal protein produced by MM patients has a very low Fc \u03b3RIIb-binding ability and is incapable of signaling through the inhibitory ITIM pathway. Germline loss of Fc \u03b3RIIb in MM patients with variation in its expression level and its downstream signaling molecule SHIP and its phosphorylation as well as the inability of MM IgG to bind cells containing this receptor is a potential new mechanism that contributes to the uncontrolled growth of MM.
