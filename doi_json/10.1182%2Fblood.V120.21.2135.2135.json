    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2135 Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a multisystem disorder characterized by immune dysregulation and hypercytokinemia. Diagnostic criteria include a genetic mutation consistent with familial HLH or the presence of 5 of 8 defined clinical criteria (fever, splenomegaly, bicytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, hemophagocytosis, low/absent NK cell function, hyperferritinemia, and elevated soluble CD25). In pediatrics, a ferritin value of >10,000 m\u03c7\u03b3/L has been reported to have 90% sensitivity and 96% specificity in defining the presence of HLH (Allen, C. E., Yu, X., Kozinetz, C. A. and McClain, K. L. (2008). Pediatr. Blood Cancer). We examined if hyperferritinemia (all patients with ferritin level >10,000 m\u03c7\u03b3/L between 2007 and 2012) correlated with diagnosis of HLH in 94 patients (73 adult; 21 pediatric) at our institution. Chart reviews were performed to evaluate the presence or absence of HLH criteria, additional clinical features that may be indicative of HLH, and diagnosis. These data resulted in our classification of patients into four groups ( Table 1  ): (1) \u201cclinically defined HLH\u201d when predetermined criteria were met; (2) \u201cpotential HLH\u201d when clinical criteria was suggestive of HLH, but not all criteria were met; (3) \u201cpossible HLH\u201d when rheumatologic syndromes, liver disease, or fever/DIC was present of unknown etiology; or (4) \u201cNon-HLH\u201d when the elevated ferritin was a result of a known etiology ( Table 2  ). As expected, 18 (86 %) of pediatric patients with a ferritin > 10,000 m\u03c7\u03b3/L had clinically defined or potential/possible HLH. Notably, 44 (60 %) of adult patients with a ferritin > 10,000 mg/L had clinically defined or potential/possible HLH. Such an incidence of HLH in the adult population with elevated ferritin raises caution for appropriate diagnosis of this population and clearly warrants further study. If patients with sickle cell disease, GVH, or known causes for liver failure are excluded, then HLH should be suspected in 83% of adult patients with ferritins >10,000 mcg/L.
