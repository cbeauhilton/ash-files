    "abstract_text": "Background: CAR T cell therapies are generally administered in an inpt setting owing to concerns of AE management. Infusion and monitoring of pts who receive CAR T cell therapy at nonuniversity medical centers (NMC) and in outpt settings have not been studied specifically. Liso-cel is an autologous CD19-directed, defined composition, 4-1BB CAR T cell product administered at equal target doses of CD8 + and CD4 + CAR + T cells. In TRANSCEND NHL 001 (NCT02631044) in pts with third- or later-line LBCL, liso-cel treatment showed an ORR of 73% (CR rate, 53%), with grade \u2265 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in 2%, and grade \u2265 3 neurological events (NE) in 10% of pts (Abramson et al. Lancet 2020). We report outcomes of liso-cel in pts with R/R LBCL across inpt and outpt settings at NMCs in the United States treated in the OUTREACH study (NCT03744676). Methods: The study enrolled pts at NMCs, including those with university affiliations and centers na\u00efve to CAR T cell therapy. Adults with R/R PET-positive LBCL after \u2265 2 lines of therapy and ECOG PS \u2264 1 were eligible. Pts with grade 3-4 cytopenias, mild to moderate organ function (LVEF \u2265 40%; serum CrCl > 30 mL/min), secondary CNS lymphoma, and prior autologous HSCT were eligible. After leukapheresis and lymphodepleting chemotherapy (LDC), pts received liso-cel at a target dose of 100 \u00d7 10 6 CAR + T cells. Primary endpoint was incidence of grade \u2265 3 CRS, NEs, prolonged cytopenias (Day 29 grade \u2265 3 lab values), and infections. Secondary endpoints included safety, ORR, CR rate, duration of response (DOR), and liso-cel PK. B-cell depletion analyses were exploratory. AEs, including NEs, were graded using NCI CTCAE v4.03; CRS was graded per Lee criteria (2014). NEs were defined as investigator-identified neurological AEs related to liso-cel. All study sites had a multidisciplinary CAR T cell therapy team and standard operating procedures (SOP) for outpt monitoring of toxicity and admission for CRS/NE management. Results: At data cutoff, 71 pts were treated with liso-cel at NMCs; 52 and 19 were monitored as outpts and inpts, respectively. Median age was 65 years (range, 28-83; \u2265 65 years, 51%; \u2265 75 years, 18%); 65% of pts had de novo DLBCL, 68% had screening ECOG PS of 1, 82% were chemotherapy refractory, 31% had \u2265 3 prior therapies, and 48% had markers of high tumor burden (pre-LDC LDH \u2265 500 U/L or SPD \u2265 50 cm 2 ). Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were generally similar in outpts and inpts, respectively, with differences of \u2265 20% noted in incidences of high-grade B-cell lymphoma (4% vs 42%) and DLBCL transformed from indolent lymphoma (29% vs 0%). Overall, any-grade CRS occurred in 39% of pts (no grade \u2265 3) and NEs in 32% (grade 3-4, 10%); 27% received tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids for CRS or NEs. Incidences of any-grade CRS and NEs were similar in outpts and inpts, while grade \u2265 3 NEs, infections, and prolonged cytopenias were numerically higher in outpts, but similar to pivotal trial observations ( Table ). The most common treatment-emergent AEs were neutropenia (68%), leukopenia (45%), CRS (39%), anemia (38%), thrombocytopenia (37%), and fatigue (35%). No grade 5 AEs were reported. Early (study Day \u2264 4) and overall hospitalization occurred in 33% and 69% of outpts, respectively; median time to hospitalization was 5.0 days (range 2-141) in outpts. The median (range) length of initial hospital stay after liso-cel administration was 6.0 days (1-28; n = 36) for outpts versus 10.0 days (0-31; n = 19) for inpts; 31% of outpts were not hospitalized. All pts were efficacy evaluable. The ORR was 77% and the CR rate was 51%. Median DOR was 14.8 months (95% CI, 3.9\u2012not reached [NR]) for outpts and was NR (95% CI, 2.0\u2012NR) for inpts at a median follow-up of 8.1 months and 11.3 months, respectively ( Table ). PK profiles were similar in outpts and inpts. Target depletion of CD19 + B cells in peripheral blood was also similar between oupts and inpts, and was maintained over the period of 1 year. Conclusions: Pts with R/R LBCL were successfully treated with liso-cel in outpt and inpt settings at NMCs and monitored for CAR T cell therapy-related toxicities using SOPs and multidisciplinary teams. Liso-cel demonstrated durable clinical activity with a favorable safety profile in both outpts and inpts. Incidences of severe CRS and NEs were low, as was tocilizumab and/or corticosteroid use. These data support liso-cel administration at NMCs and in the outpt setting.
