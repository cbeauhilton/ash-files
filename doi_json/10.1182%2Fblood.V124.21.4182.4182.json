    "abstract_text": "Background Integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 plays an essential role in platelet aggregation and quantitative or qualitative defects in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 lead to severe bleeding diathesis, which is known as Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT). Although platelet counts and morphology are usually normal in GT patients, we and others found that several mutations around transmembrane regions of \u03b1IIb or \u03b23, which cause constitutive activation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23, are associated with macrothrombocytopenia. Among them, \u03b1IIb(R995W) was found in four unrelated Japanese families, suggesting that the mutation may be the most prevalent in Japanese regarding \u03b1IIb\u03b23-associated macrothrombocytopenia (Kunishima, Kashiwagi, et al. Blood . 2011;117:5479-84). We also found reduction of surface expression of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 on platelets in patients with \u03b1IIb\u03b23-associated macrothrombocytopenia, suggesting that activating mutations may affect platelet function via not only activating state of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 but also its expression (Kashiwagi, et al. Mol Genet Genomic Med . 2013;1:77-86). In this study, we generated \u03b1IIb(R990W), which is corresponding to human \u03b1IIb(R995W), knock-in (KI) mice and analyzed the effects of constitutive activation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 on platelet numbers, morphology and function. Methods : \u03b1IIb(R990W) mutation was introduced to C57BL/6-derived ES cells by homologous recombination and KI mice were generated. Reticulated platelets were detected by flow cytometry after thiazole orange staining. Platelet life span was assessed by flow cytometry after injection with NHS-biotin. Platelet function was assessed by light transmission aggregometry and platelet adhesion/aggregation on collagen-coated glass under shear stress in vitro. Platelet function was also assessed by tail bleeding time and thrombus formation induced by FeCl 3 injury on mesenteric artery in vivo. Results : Hetero and Homo KI mice were born in accordance with Mendel\u2019s laws and showed no obvious bleeding tendency. Platelet counts were decreased in KI mice [WT: 1.22\u00b10.11(x10 6 /\u03bcl), Hetero: 1.10\u00b10.14*, Homo: 0.91\u00b10.11* (*p<0.05 compared with WT)] and platelet size assessed by forward side scatter of flow cytometry showed mild increase of platelet size in KI mice [WT: 26.3\u00b10.60 (arbitrary unit), Hetero: 27.7\u00b10.56*, Homo: 32.5\u00b10.98*(*p<0.05 compared with WT)]. Absolute reticulated platelet numbers of Homo were decreased compared with WT [WT: 102\u00b121.9 (x10 3 /\u03bcl), Hetero: 84.0\u00b123.7, Homo: 66.6\u00b112.3*(*p10min in 8 of 10 mice]. Thrombus formation on collagen-coated coverslip under flow conditions as well as platelet aggregation induced by collagen and PAR4-TRAP was markedly impaired in Homo platelets. Homo mice also showed markedly impaired thrombus formation in FeCl 3 -induced thrombus model. There were no significant differences in platelet function between Hetero and WT. Conclusion : The \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activating mutation, \u03b1IIb(R990W), leads to macrothrombocytopenia in mice. Homo KI mice also show marked reduction of surface \u03b1IIb\u03b23 expression in platelet, leading to severe impairment of platelet aggregation and thrombus formation like GT.
