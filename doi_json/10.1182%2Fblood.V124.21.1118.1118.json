    "abstract_text": "Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) has been successfully used clinically to augment the graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in relapsed patients. However, improvements can still be made in enhancing anti-tumor activity, reducing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and decreasing complications from opportunistic infections. Our studies present clear evidence of increased tumor clearance via cytokine therapy in combination with DLI as a way to \u201cboost\u201d the infused cells function. Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a potent cytokine that increases CD8+ T and NK cells number and function in normal mice and recipients of stem cell transplantation. Despite this, obstacles remain for use of IL-15 therapeutically, specifically its low potency and short in vivo half-life. To overcome this, a new IL-15 superagonist (IL-15 SA-(ALT-803)) has been developed with a longer half-life and increased potency. Administration of IL-15 SA to recipients of CFSE labeled T cells increases proliferation of CD8+T cells and IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 secretion from CD8+T cells. We developed a murine DLI model by titrating the dose of infused T cells in a parent-F1 model, and then combined IL-15 SA administration with DLI in murine recipients of allogeneic HSCT. In this model, lethally irradiated CB6F1 (H2K b/d ) mice were transplanted with T- cell depleted bone marrow cells from C57BL6 mice (H2K b ). All recipients of HSCT were also co-injected A20 B-cell lymphoma cells transfected with a luciferase-producing gene, which allows bioluminescent imaging and tracking of tumor progress in vivo . Mice receiving DLI (2.5 X 10 5 T cells) with IL-15 SA injections given at 1\u03bcg/mouse on days 17 and 24 post-BMT show less tumor burden and increased overall survival (p = 0.04) and decreased tumor growth (p = 0.02) (Figure 1). The IL-15 SA treated group had a significantly less weight loss than the control group (p = 0.007). No GVHD symptoms were noted via weekly clinical scoring, highlighting both the efficacy and overall safety of the IL-15 SA therapy. Furthermore, we evaluated T- cell exhaustion markers on CD8+ T cells in surviving mice. We found increased programmed death-1 (PD-1) expression on T cells even when the tumor burden is cleared. Treatment with IL-15 SA reduced PD-1 expression on donor CD8+ T-cells in mice surviving more than 120 days post-transplant. We conclude that IL-15 SA enhances CD8+ T cell function by increasing cytokine secretion and proliferation of T cells whereas could also prevent T cell exhaustion. We suggest that IL-15 SA is a long-waited lymphoid growth factor and has the potential to use in combination with DLI for the treatment of recurrent disease after HSCT.
