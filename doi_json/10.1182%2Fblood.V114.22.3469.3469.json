    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3469 Poster Board III-357 Epigenetic inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (TSG) by promoter CpG island hypermethylation is a common hallmark of cancer. It is generally agreed, that CpG island hypermethylation profiles are specific for different tumor types [Costello et al., 2000, Nat Genet 25:132-138]. Using MS-MLPA (methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification), methylation of 24 different TSG was analyzed in 40 lymphoma cell lines representing Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), Burkitt lymphoma (BL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). On average 8 \u00b1 2.8 TSG out of the 24 analyzed were methylated per lymphoma cell line, whereas 0/24 TSG were methylated in healthy donor tonsils. Methylation frequencies decreased from HL, ALCL, BL, FL, DLBCL to MCL cell lines. The TSG methylation status of the most relevant genes was verified by methylation-specific PCR. Moreover, TSG hypermethylation correlated with transcriptional silencing as assessed by quantitative real time PCR. While our studies on the methylation status of TSG in lymphoma cell lines support previous methylation analyses performed on primary lymphoma patient material for many of the genes analyzed here, MS-MLPA screening also revealed a new interesting candidate: CD44. Hypermethylation of CD44 was characteristic of ALCL, BL, FL and DLBCL cell lines and allowed their discrimination from MCL and HL cell lines. In CD44 hypermethylated cell lines expression of CD44 was re-inducible at mRNA and protein levels by treatment with the demethylating agent 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine, confirming its epigenetic regulation. Furthermore, CD44 ligation with an anti-CD44 antibody induced apoptosis in CD44 + ( CD44 unmethylated) lymphoma cell lines whereas CD44 hypermethylated cell lines showed no response. Thus, CD44 might be an interesting new epigenetic marker and a potential molecular target for the diagnosis and treatment of specific lymphoma subtypes.
