    "abstract_text": "Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia(MMM) is a progenitor cell colony disease. The mechanism is not very clean. The prognosis is poor in MMM patients of the traditional treatment with Hydroxyurea, Interferne, Prednisone, transfusion. Thalidomide is a new anti-angiogenesis drug of inhibiting the genesis of fibrosis. Some reports presented that the cure method only is stem cell transplantation includes autologous and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Patient Sui, Man, 55 years, Chinese. He was hospitalized on Aug fifth, 2004, because he has had pale, severe weakness, for 5 months. T 36.C, HR 70, R 18/min, BP114/59 mmHg. Hb56g/L, WBC 5.7x10 9 /L, Plt 72 x10 9 /L.There were 0.66 plasma cell in bone marrow and his bone marrow aspiration with dry draw at the diagnosis,. The result of bone marrow biopsy was fibrosis. He received 4 courses of VAD regimens (VCR 0.4mg,d1\u20134; ADM 10mg,d1\u20134, DXM 40mg d1\u20134) before autologous peripheral stem cell (PBSCs) transplantation. The plasma cell count decreased from 0.66 before to 0.025 after the first course of VAD regimen in the bone marrow. The stem cell mobilization regimen was chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, Cy, 2g/m2), high-dose methylprednisolone (MP), and G-CSF 250 ug, bid d1\u20135. The nucleated cell count of collection showed the a minimum of 4.17x10 8 /kg per kg of body weight, CD34+ was 0.834x106/kg.The conditional regimen was melphalan 200mg/kg divided 2 times a day and cyclophosphamide 600mg VD. He received re-transfused PBSCs on March 25,2005. His neutrophil cell decreased 0 at +4 day after transplantation. He received platelet transfusion of single donor two times when his platelet decreased 7 x 10 9 /L. his hemotopoietic recovered at +11d. He left transplantation ward +13 d. His platelet, WBC were normal, Hb 108g/L At+d. Bone marrow draw was no dry. There was 0.07 of plasma cell in his bone marrow. The result of reticulum protein stain was degree 3 after and 4 before PBSCT at +70d. Discussion: MM is incurable tumor because the tumor cells polluted in graft of bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells. Some author considered the pollution tumor cell decreases with high-dose MP mobilization. Mobilization of stem cell in advanced MMM is difficulty, so we (1) increased the 3 times of mobilization, (2) added high-dose of MP to mobilization regimen of combination of Cy and G-CSF. The patient had received pre-transplantation of four courses of VAD chemotherapy regimen and the combination of west and Traditional Chinese Medicine to manage during stem cell transplantation. The patient had chronic gastric ulcer so we afraid of the condition result in relapse of it so we given the patient intravenous melphalan. Some researchers studied 21 cases of multiple myeloma were treated by autologous bone marrow transplantation. The condition regimen was melphalan 16 mg/kg. The role of allogeneic BMT as compared with autologous BMT is not yet defined. The patient had been followed up for 4 months, the result showed his plasma cell was 0.07 in his bone marrow. The degree of myeloid metaplasia had changed from degree 4 to 2. Conclusion: Intensive treatment with marrow rescue could induce complete remission of long duration in some patients and provided the basis for increased attempts to cure myeloma by intentive chemoradiotherapy and BMT. It is effective in multiple myeloma treatment with autologous stem cell transplantation. The curable method is only allogeneic stem cell maybe.",
