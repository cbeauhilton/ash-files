    "abstract_text": "Background: Clinical outcome studies have shown that it is safe to withhold anticoagulant therapy in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) who have a negative D-dimer result and a low pre-test probability (PTP) either using a PTP model or clinical gestalt. Purpose: To assess the safety of the combination of a non-high PTP using the Wells or Geneva models with a negative VIDAS\u00a9 D-dimer result to exclude PE. Data Source: A systematic literature search strategy was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials and all EBM Reviews. Study Selection: Seven studies (6 prospective management studies and 1 randomized controlled trial) reporting failure rates at three months were included in the analysis. Non-high PTP was defined has \u201cunlikely\u201d or \u201clow/intermediate\u201d PTP using either, the Wells\u2019 score, the Geneva, Revised Geneva Score, or gestalt estimation. Data extraction: Two reviewers independently extracted data onto standardized forms. Data Synthesis: A total of 5,622 patients with non-high PTP were assessed using the VIDAS\u00a9 D-dimer. PE was ruled out by a negative VIDAS\u00a9 D-dimer test in 40% (95% confidence intervals (CI) 38.7 to 41.2%) of patients. The three-month thromboembolic risk in patients left untreated was 0.14% (95% CI 0.05 to 0.4%). Table 1. Accuracy Indices  . Total non-high PTP and negative VIDAS\u00a9 D-Dimer .
