It is also thought that these transcription factors drive the overexpression of oncogenes involved in IgH translocations through upregulation of the IgH enhancers. We sought to evaluate the expression of Oct-2 and Bob1 in multiple myeloma, a malignancy of the B cell/plasmacyte lineage, in order to determine their potential biological significance as determinants of disease behaviour/prognosis and as potential therapeutic targets. Methods: A tissue microarray containing triplicate samples from 220 myeloma patient samples was generated. Samples were collected at the time of diagnosis between 1993 and 2008. To measure Oct-2 and Bob-1 protein expression in the CD138+ plasma cells of each sample, fluorescent immunohistochemistry was used to stain the samples and the HistoRx PM-2000 platformTM was used to generate an AQUA score for each patient. Oct-2 AQUA scores were available for 169 patient samples and Bob-1 AQUA scores were available for 169 patient samples. The analysis was repeated using conventional immunohistochemistry and visual scoring of staining intensity. Results: The Oct-2 and Bob-1 AQUA scores were continuously distributed over the patient cohort; thus, subsequent analyses were done by dividing the patient cohort by the median Oct-2 or Bob-1 AQUA score and comparing the group with high AQUA scores to the group with low AQUA scores. The patient group with high Oct-2 AQUA scores had an OS of 52.8 months compared to 73.1 months in the group with low Oct-2 AQUA scores (hazard ratio [HR]=1.74, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.11-2.73, p=0.0164). The patient group with high Bob-1 AQUA scores had an OS of 70.5 months compared with 38.3 months in the group with low Bob-1 AQUA scores (HR=0.46, 95% CI=0.29-0.71, p=0.0008). In a Cox regression proportional hazards model including autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) status, serum albumin, serum \u03b22-microglobulin and Oct-2 or Bob-1 AQUA scores, only ASCT status was independently predictive of OS. The patient group with low Oct-2 AQUA scores had a significantly higher proportion of ASCT recipients than the group with high Oct-2 AQUA scores. Conversely, the patient group with high Bob-1 AQUA scores had a significantly higher proportion of ASCT recipients than the group with low Bob-1 AQUA scores. Results were similar but not statistically significant when analyzing the TMA with conventional immunohistochemistry and visual scoring of staining intensity. Discussion: In this retrospective study high Oct-2 expression was found to be associated with decreased OS, while high Bob-1 protein expression was associated with increased OS. These results suggest that Oct-2 is a negative prognostic factor in myeloma, while Bob-1 is a favorable prognostic factor, and demonstrates the applicability of the HistoRx platform to myeloma bone marrow TMA analysis. Since this was a small, exploratory study these results must be interpreted with caution and must be confirmed in a larger, prospective analysis.
