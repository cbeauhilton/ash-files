    "abstract_text": "Background: Several targeted therapies have been recently approved as treatment options for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), however, complete remissions (CR) in relapsed/refractory (R/R) patients remain low. Due to suboptimal responses to standard therapies, most of these patients do not receive an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). In addition, AML patients \u226555 years have poor tolerance and high morbidity from a myeloablative HCT. The SIERRA trial (Study of Iomab-B in Elderly Relapsed or Refractory AML) has been investigating the use of Iomab-B, an 131 I-labeled anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody, to reduce relapse in patients with active, R/R AML who receive HCT as compared to Conventional Care (CC) therapies. With the recent approval of various targeted therapies like BCL-2 inhibitors (e.g., venetoclax), FLT-3 inhibitors (e.g., midostaurin and gilteritinib) and IDH inhibitors (e.g., ivosidenib), the protocol was amended to include patients refractory to these therapies. We are reporting on the success rate of engraftment and tolerability of Iomab-B among the CC patients who cross-over to receive Iomab-B and HCT after failing these agents. Methods: Approximately 150 older patients with R/R AML are to be randomized (1:1) to receive Iomab-B followed by fludarabine, total body irradiation (2 Gy) and allogeneic HCT, or to conventional care (CC). CC patients receive physician's choice of therapy, including targeted therapies, and may proceed to standard of care allogeneic HCT if they achieve CR. CC patients not achieving CR may cross over to Iomab-B-based HCT. Results: Available data for 136 patients (>90% of target enrollment; median age 65) demonstrated they had a median of 3 (range: 1-7) prior lines of AML therapies. Median marrow blast at time of study entry was 25%. Prior to enrollment, 85 (63%) patients received targeted therapies, including BCL-2 inhibitors (62%), FLT-3 inhibitors (18%), IDH inhibitors (7%) and others (13%; e.g., gemtuzumab ozogamicin). Among the 50 evaluable patients in the Iomab-B group that received HCT, all successfully engrafted after a median radiation dose delivered to marrow of 14.7 Gy (range: 4.6 - 44.6) with a median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment of 14.5 (range: 9-28) and 18 (range: 4-58) days, respectively. Of 63 patients randomized to the CC arm and with data available, 11 (17%) achieved CR and proceeded to standard of care HCT without Iomab-B while 52 (83%) did not respond to CC therapy. Twenty-seven of 63 (43%) CC patients received targeted therapy, of whom 21 received venetoclax with hypomethylating agents (HMA) or low-dose Cytarabine (LDAC). Seven of the 27 (26%) CC patients remission after targeted therapy and received standard of care HCT. Of the 20 patients who did not respond to targeted therapies, 11 (55%) crossed-over and received Iomab-B/HCT with a median radiation dose delivered to marrow of 18 Gy (range: 12.6 - 22.6). Median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 12 (range: 10-27) and 20 (range: 15-38) days, respectively. Safety data are available for 103 transplanted patients in both groups and are presented in table. The incidence of Grade \u22653 febrile neutropenia (FN) was 37% vs 55%, sepsis 5% vs 30%, and mucositis 10% vs 20% in the Iomab-B group compared to all transplanted patients in the CC group. In patients who received targeted therapy and HCT (crossover or standard HCT), incidences of FN, sepsis and mucositis were 39%, 28% and 22%, respectively. Conclusion: SIERRA trial patients not achieving CR with recently approved targeted therapies who then crossed-over to receive HCT with Iomab-B successfully engrafted. Time to engraftment was similar to those who were randomized to receive Iomab-B and HCT. Available data suggest incidences of sepsis and mucositis are lower in the Iomab-B group.
