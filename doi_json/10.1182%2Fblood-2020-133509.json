The presentation consisted of features typical of hemolytic anemia with other causes excluded, signifying a viral etiology of this disease process that has not yet been reported. Other known etiologies of hemolytic anemia were ruled out with extensive history and laboratory data, implying the SARS-COV2 virus was the only determining factor.
