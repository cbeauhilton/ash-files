It has been reported that THAP11 is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues and frequently downregulated in several tumors. In CML cells, we found that THAP11 expression was inhibited. We investigated the mechanisms of the suppression of THAP11 and its function in CML cell proliferation. [Methods] The cells used in this study were human CML cell lines, K562 and Meg01 cells. Primary CML cells were obtained from the bone marrow of CML (CP) patients. Human normal mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated from bone marrow of healthy volunteers after obtaining informed consents. For analysis of THAP11 mRNA expression, quantitative RT-PCR was performed in all cell lines treated with Abl kinase inhibitors (STI571, AMN107, and BMS354825). For proliferation analysis and the expression of c-Myc in CML cells, MTT assays, western blot and cell cycle analysis were performed in all cell lines transfected with Bcr-Abl siRNA, THAP11 siRNA, or THAP11 cDNA respectively. Moreover, THAP11 expression, c-Myc expression, and the colony counts of CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM, and BFU-E were analyzed in CML stem/progenitor cells transfected with Bcr-Abl siRNA or treated with Abl kinase inhibitors. [Results] In CML cell lines treated with Abl kinase inhibitors or transfected with Bcr-Abl siRNA, the expressions of THAP11 and c-Myc mRNA and protein were significantly increased compared to untreated cells. On the other hand, in CML cells transfected with the THAP11 cDNA, the c-Myc expression was suppressed. The overexpression of THAP11 induced G1 cell cycle arrest through p27 and p21 accumulation, and inhibited the CML cell proliferation. Moreover, in CML stem/progenitor cells obtained from patients with CML, the transfection with Bcr-Abl siRNA or treatment with Abl kinase inhibitors increased the expression of THAP11 mRNA and protein, and decreased the c-Myc expression and the counts of CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM and BFU-E. [Conclusion] Our results demonstrated that the Bcr-Abl suppressed the expression of THAP11, the depletion of THAP11 induced c-Myc expression, and induced the proliferation of CML cells through cell cycle progression. Moreover, induction of THAP11 expression inhibited the proliferation of CML stem/progenitor cells. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
