    "abstract_text": "Adoptive transfer of T cells with a CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to treat B-cell malignancies shows remarkable clinical efficacy. However, long-term persistence of T cells targeting CD19, a pan-B cell marker, causes sustained depletion of normal B cells and consequent severe hypogammaglobulinemia. In order to target B-cell malignancies more selectively, we exploited the clonal restriction of mature B-cell malignancies, which express either a \u03ba or a \u03bb-light immunoglobulin (Ig) chain. We generated a CAR specific for \u03ba-light chain (CAR.\u03ba) to selectively target \u03ba + lymphoma/leukemia cells, while sparing the normal B cells expressing the reciprocal \u03bb-light chain, thus minimizing the impairment of humoral immunity. After preclinical validation, we designed a phase I clinical trial in which patients with refractory/relapsed \u03ba + non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are infused with autologous T cells expressing a CAR.\u03ba that includes a CD28 costimulatory domain. The protocol also included patients with multiple myeloma with the aim of targeting putative myeloma initiating cells. Three dose levels (DL) are being assessed, with escalation determined by a continual reassessment method: 0.2 (DL1), 1 (DL2) and 2 (DL3) \u00d710 8 T cells/m 2 . Repeat infusions are allowed if there is at least stable disease after treatment. End points being evaluated include safety, persistence of CAR + T cells and antitumor activity. T cells were generated for 13 patients by activating autologous PBMC with immobilized OKT3 (n=5) or CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibodies (n=8). In 2 patients with >95% circulating leukemic cells, CD3 positive selection was performed using CliniMACS. After transduction, T cells (1.2\u00d710 7 \u00b10.5\u00d710 7 ) were expanded ex vivo for 18\u00b14 days in the presence of interleukin (IL)-2 to reach sufficient numbers for dose escalation. CAR expression was 81%\u00b113% by flow cytometry (74,112\u00b123,000 transgene copy numbers/mg DNA). Products were composed predominantly of CD8 + cells (78%\u00b110%), with a small proportion of na\u00efve (5\u00b14%) and memory T cells (17%\u00b112%). CAR + T cells specifically targeted \u03ba + tumors as assessed by 51 Cr release assays (specific lysis 79%\u00b110%, 20:1 E:T ratio) but not \u03ba \u2013 tumors (11%\u00b17%) or the NK-sensitive cell line K562 (26%\u00b113%). Ten patients have been treated: 2 on DL1, 3 on DL2 and 5 on DL3. Any other treatments were discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to T-cell infusion. Patients with an absolute leukocyte count >500/\u00b5L received 12.5 mg/kg cyclophosphamide 4 days before T-cell infusion to induce mild lymphopenia. Infusions were well tolerated, without side effects. Persistence of infused T cells was assessed in blood by CAR.\u03ba-specific Q-PCR assay and peaked 1 to 2 weeks post infusion, remaining detectable for 6 weeks to 9 months. Although the CAR contained a murine single-chain variable fragment (scFv), we did not detect human anti-mouse antibodies following treatment and CAR.\u03ba + T cell expansion continued to be observed even after repeated infusions. We detected modest (<20 fold) elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, at the time of peak expansion of T cells, but systemic inflammatory response syndrome (cytokine storm) was absent. No new-onset hypogammaglobulinemia was observed. All 10 patients are currently evaluable for clinical response. Of the patients with relapsed NHL, 2/5 entered complete remission (after 2 and 3 infusions at dose level 1 and 3, respectively), 1/5 had a partial response and 2 progressed; 3/3 patients with multiple myeloma have had stable disease for 2, 8 and 11 months, associated with up to 38% reduction in their paraprotein; and 2/2 patients with CLL progressed before or shortly after the 6-week evaluation. In conclusion, our data indicate that infusion of CAR.\u03ba + T cells is safe at every DL and can be effective in patients with \u03ba + lymphoproliferative disorders.
