    "abstract_text": "Increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels can ameliorate the symptoms of patients with sickle cell disease and increase their life span. The DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor decitabine increases HbF in non-human primates (baboons) and sickle cell patients and offers great promise as an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of this disease. The goal of this investigation was to develop and test new compounds that inhibit DNMT, increase HbF, and offer significant advantages compared to decitabine such as increased stablity, reduced cytotoxicity, and a lower potential for mutagenicity. S110 is decitabine-guanine dinucleotide developed by Supergen, Inc., that is cytosine deaminase resistant and more stable in plasma than decitabine. Experiments were performed to compare the effect of S110 and decitabine on \u03b3-globin expression in human erythroid progenitor cell cultures derived from CD34+ peripheral blood cells. Cultures were treated with decitabine (1 X 10 \u22126 M) or S110 (1 and 5 X 10 \u22126 M) on day 8. Forty eight hours later, RNA was purified for real time PCR analysis of \u03b5- and \u03b3-globin gene expression by the \u0394\u0394CT method using \u03b1-globin as a control. Effects on globin polypeptide chain expression was determined by HPLC analysis of freeze-thaw lysates prepared 72 hours following drug addition. Both S110 and decitabine increased expression of \u03b5-globin and \u03b3-globin mRNA and the \u03b3/\u03b3 + \u03b2 polypeptide chain ratio (see Table).

Two baboons (PA 7256; PA 7470, P. anubis) were phlebotomized for eight days to achieve a HCT of 20 followed by treatment with S110 (1mg/kg/d; sc) for ten days. Pretreatment HbF levels were 3.1% (PA 7256) and 3.5% (PA 7470). Following S110 treatment, peak HbF levels of 46.1% (PA 7256) and 75.5% (PA 7470) were attained that were similar to levels observed in animals treated with equivalent molar doses of decitabine. Bisulfite sequence analysis showed that the level of DNA methylation of 5 CpG sites within the \u03b3-globin promoter in purified BM erythroblasts following S110 administration was significantly lower (41.5%, PA 7256; 16.3%, PA 7470) compared to erythroblasts from bled, untreated baboons (70.8%; n=4). Pharmacokinetics was also evaluated in parallel to assess systemic exposure. These data demonstrate that S110, a newly developed decitabine-guanine dinucleotide, effectively increased HbF and reduced DNA methylation in cultured human erythroid progenitor cells and in experimental non-human primates.",
