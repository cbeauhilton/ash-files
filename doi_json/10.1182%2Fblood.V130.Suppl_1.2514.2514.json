    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Stathmin 1 is a microtubule destabilizer protein involved in the proliferation and differentiation of early hematopoietic progenitors. Aberrant Stathmin 1 expression has been reported in hematological malignancies. Stathmin 1 silencing reduces cell proliferation and clonogenicity of leukemia cell lines. A previous study identified that the PML-RAR\u03b1 fusion protein, which is necessary to acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) genesis, positively regulates Stathmin 1 at transcription and protein activity levels. However, Stathmin 1 expression and its impact on prognosis and leukemia cell biology have rarely been studied in APL. Objectives : To evaluate Stathmin 1 expression and its association with laboratory and clinical parameters in a cohort of APL patients. To investigate Stathmin 1 expression and activity upon all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment and during cell cycle in the PML-RAR\u03b1 cell lines. Finally, to phenocopy the effects of Stathmin 1 inhibition using the pharmacological microtubule stabilizing agent paclitaxel. Methods : Bone marrow samples from 121 APL patients enrolled in the International Consortium on Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (IC-APL) at diagnosis and 22 healthy donors were included. Patients were treated with ATRA and chemotherapy as described elsewhere. Patients were dichotomized according to Stathmin 1 expression using the median as cut-off. The PML-RAR\u03b1 cell lines, NB4 (ATRA-sensible) and NB4-R2 (ATRA-resistant) were used for functional assays. Cell cycle was synchronized by double thymidine block. For dose-response curves (MTT), PML-RAR\u03b1 cells were treated with graded concentrations of paclitaxel and IC 50 values were calculated using a nonlinear regression analysis. For apoptosis assay (annexin V/PI), PML-RAR\u03b1 cells were treated with ATRA (1 \u00b5M) and/or IC 50 paclitaxel dose for 72 hours. Gene and protein expressions were evaluated by qPCR and Western blot, and microtubule networks by confocal microscopy. For statistical analyses, Fisher's exact test or Chi-square test were used to compare categorical variables. Mann-Whitney test, t Student test or ANOVA test and Bonferroni post-test were used to compare continuous variables. Log-rank test and Cox regression were used for survival analyzes. P -value <0.05 was considerate statistically significant. Results : Stathmin 1 transcripts were significantly increased in bone marrow samples from APL patients compared with healthy donors (median 1.21 [range 0.02-4.62] versus ( vs. ) 0.66 [0.01-1.71]; p <0.01). Stathmin 1 levels did not impact on disease-free survival, overall survival and complete remission rates of APL patients. No relevant association between Stathmin 1 expression and clinical and laboratory parameters were observed. In NB4 cells, but not in NB4-R2, ATRA induced granulocytic differentiation, associated with a prominent reduction of Stathmin 1 gene and protein expression ( p <0.05). Paradoxically, ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation strongly reduced \u03b1-tubulin acetylation (microtubule stability marker) in NB4 cells. Using thymidine-synchronized cells, we observed that Stathmin 1 phosphorylation at serine 16 (an inhibitory site) was predominant in pool of mitosis-enriched cells, and its phosphorylation was marked reduced in pool of G1-enriched cells. NB4 and NB4-R2 cells presented high sensibility to paclitaxel treatment (IC 50 of 3.6 nM and 1.8 nM, respectively). In NB4-R2 cells, but not in NB4 cells, paclitaxel increased the number of apoptotic cells after 72 hours of ATRA treatment; increased annexin V and caspase 3 cleavage ( p <0.05). Paclitaxel treatment increased acetyl-\u03b1-tubulin, y-H2AX and CDKN1A levels. Conclusions : Stathmin 1 is highly expressed, but does not impact clinical outcomes in APL patients. Stathmin 1 reduces during ATRA-induced cell differentiation. Stathmin 1 activity is reduced during mitosis (as demonstrate by increased p-Stathmin 1 S16 ) and increases post-mitosis (reduced p-Stathmin 1 S16 ), indicating that this protein participates in microtubule dynamics and cell cycle progression in PML-RAR\u03b1 cells. Paclitaxel was an efficient pharmacological agent in inducing microtubule stabilization, reducing cell viability, increasing mitotic catastrophe as monotherapy or in combination with ATRA, in PML-RAR\u03b1 cells, including ATRA-resistant cells. Our study provides new insights on Stathmin 1 and microtubule dynamics in APL. Disclosures Bittencourt: Janssen, Takeda: Honoraria.",
