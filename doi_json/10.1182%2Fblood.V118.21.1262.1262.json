    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1262 Introduction: Surgical bleeding is among the most frequent symptoms in Factor VII (FVII) deficient patients: in an analysis by our group, post-surgical bleeding was reported in 24% of cases (Mariani G. et al. Thromb Haemost 2005;93:481). A recent retrospective study showed a similar prevalence of surgical bleeding (15%) with a significant relation between this type of bleeding, deep hematomas and a FVII coagulant activity (FVIIc) of less than 7% (Benlakal F et al. J Thromb Haemost 2011;9:1149). Little is known about prevention of bleeding in \u2018minor surgical interventions\u2019, important tools in modern medicine, bearing not a negligible risk of bleeding, as local hemostasis may not always be punctually achieved. Aim: Analysis of Replacement Therapy (RT) for minor surgeries in patients with FVII deficiency, prospectively reported in the Seven treatment Evaluation Registry (STER). Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01269138 . Methods: Analysis of RTs used in 38 minor surgical procedures (34 patients; FVIIc:<1\u201320%). Minor surgical procedures were defined as suggested by Kitchens (Surgery and hemostasis. Textbook of Consultative Hemostasis and Thrombosis. 2007). Results: Reported interventions included: oral surgery (n=15), endoscopic biopsies ( n =7), catheter insertions ( n =3), ear-nose-throat and head-neck ( n =5), mixed type ( n =8). RT schedules were based on recombinant-activated FVII (rFVIIa; n =29), plasma-derived FVII (pdFVII; n =8), or Fresh-Frozen-Plasma ( n =1). One-day RT schedule was employed in 27 procedures, 2\u201310 days in 11 procedures. Total doses ranged from 7.2\u2013510 \u03bcg/kg (rFVIIa) and 9\u2013300 IU/kg (pdFVII). FFP was given at a total dose of 50 ml/kg (1-day treatment, split into 4 doses of 12.5 ml). Antifibrinolytics were administered together with RT in 16 procedures (11 dental) for a minimum of 1 day to a maximum of 7 days. No bleeding nor thrombotic events occurred; one patient developed an inhibitor ( Table 1 ). Table 1. Type of intervention, replacement therapy schedules and outcome  Minor Surgery Procedures . n .

In complicated and more elaborate interventions, longer-lasting RT schedules and higher doses may be needed. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
