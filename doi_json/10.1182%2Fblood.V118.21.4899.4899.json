    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4899 [Background] The WHO classification has been widely accepted among physicians who are engaged in treating pediatric AML patients. In 2008, the revised WHO classification has expanded the two categories in AML; AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities and AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. The epidemiology and prognostic significance of these refined categories remains to be explored in children. [Methods] JPLSG AML-05 is a nationwide clinical trial for children with de novo AML, excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia and myeloid leukemia with Down syndrome, which was conducted between November 2006 and December 2010 in Japan. A central review of diagnosis based on the WHO classification was prospectively performed on each case soon after morphological, cytogenetical and immunological data were submitted to data center. Regarding the cases with discrepant results among these parameters, further diagnostic tests including FISH and chimera gene analyses were underwent to confirm the diagnoses. [Results] Four hundred and eighty four patients were enrolled in the study. Thirty patients did not meet the criteria of AML. We could not collected suitable data for diagnosis in 6 patients. Regarding the rest 448 patients, diagnoses based on the WHO classification 2001 and 2008 were determined. According to the 2001 version, 227 (50.6%) had AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities:124 (27.7%) of AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22);(AML1/ETO ), 32 (7.1%) of AML with inv(16)(p13q22); (CBF\u03b2/MYH11), 38 (8.5%) of AML with t(9;11)(p22;q23), and 33 (7.4%) of AML with the other11q23 (MLL) abnormalities, 36 (8.0%) had AML with multilineage dysplasia, and 185 (41.3%) had AML, not otherwise categorized. According to 2008 version, 235 (52.5%) had AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities: 124 (27.7%) of t(8;21)(q22;q22);(AML1/ETO ), 32 (7.1%) of AML with inv(16)(p13q22); (CBF\u03b2/MYH11), 38 (8.5%) of AML with t(9;11)(p22;q23), 33 (7.4%) of AML with the other11q23 (MLL) abnormalities,4 of AML with t(6;9)(p23;q34);DEK-NUP214,2 of AML with inv(3)(q21q26.2) or t(3;3)(q21;q26.2);RPN1-EVI13, and 2 of AML with t(1;22)(p13;q13);RBM15-MKL, 88 (19.6.7%) had AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (29 from morphological features of myelodysplasia and 59 from myelodysplasia-related cytogenetic abnormalities), 119 (26.6%) had AML, not otherwise categorized and 7(1.6%) had mixed phenotype acute leukemia (6 of T/myeloid and 1 of B/myeloid). [Discussion] Our comprehensive approach for diagnosis was a useful modality for precise diagnosis of uncertain cases, which might have been assigned to the category of AML, with not otherwise categorized, previously. As a result, the present study shows an increased prevalence of AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities or AML with myeloid dysplasia-related changes among pediatric patients with previously untreated AML. Analysis of the AML-05 trial will elucidate the prognostic impact of these categories. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
