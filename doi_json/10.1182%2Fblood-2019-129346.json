    "abstract_text": "Introduction: HIV infected individuals are 17x more likely to receive a diagnosis of Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) compared to their uninfected counterparts. Moreover, DLBCL is more aggressive in HIV infected individuals. However, the molecular pathology driving the aggressive nature of HIV related DLBCL is poorly understood. Previously, we demonstrated that HIV-associated [HIV(+)] germinal center B-cell (GCB) DLBCL tumors are more proliferative, with enhanced genomic stability and increased expression of DNA repair genes compared to their HIV-not associated [HIV(-)] counterparts (Maguire et al, Int J Cancer,2019). Given the immunocompromised nature of these patients, herein we assessed whether specific immunological signaling pathways are also altered in HIV(+) GCB DLBCL tumors, that may work in conjunction with, or independently of, increased DNA repair, to drive the enhanced aggressive nature of HIV related DLBCL. Methods: We used our previously studied cohort of patient samples, which included a total of 39 molecularly defined GCB DLBCL cases. Of these, 18 were HIV(+) cases from the AIDS Cancer Specimen Resource Network (https://acsr.ucsf.edu/) and 21 were HIV(-) institutional cases. Samples underwent hematopathologist review for diagnosis confirmation and tumor content assessment. Samples with <60% tumor content were macrodissected, with a total of 4x 5\u00b5m FFPE sections per sample used for RNA/DNA extraction. Digital gene expression profiling was used to assess differential expression of 579 immune related genes using the NanoString PanCancer Immune Profiling panel. The data was normalized using nSolver, and differential expression analysis was performed using the R statistical software package NanoStringDiff. The resulting expression data were then analyzed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and GSEA Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) overlap analyses. Results: A total of 110 genes were differentially expressed between the HIV(+) and HIV(-) cohorts at p<0.05. As expected due to immunosuppression in HIV(+) individuals, 100 genes (91%) were significantly reduced and 10 genes (9%) were significantly increased in the HIV(+) cohort compared to the HIV(-) cohort. GSEA and MSigDB analyses revealed that the genes with reduced expression in the HIV(+) cohort were associated with losses in both adaptive and innate immune signaling including cytokine interactions, the IL1 pathway and B-cell receptor signaling amongst others. MSigDB overlap analyses of the 10 genes upregulated in the HIV(+) cohort identified 3 Gene Ontology molecular functions, all of which were receptor signaling related; including Receptor Binding (CD8A, CD160, CCL8, C1QBP, MIF), Receptor Activity (CD8A, CD160, CCRL1, TFRC, KLRC2), and Cargo Receptor Activity (CCRL1, TFRC). Gene overlaps between the subsets include genes associated with NK and cytolytic T cells (CD8A, CD160), as well as the transferrin receptor TRFC/CD71, which with a fold increase of 3.9, was the most significantly increased gene in the HIV(+) cohort (p=0.002, FDR=0.0025). Conclusions: As expected, the results demonstrate a loss in both adaptive and innate immune signaling in the HIV(+) cohort compared to the HIV negative cohort as well as alterations in receptor signaling. In line with our previous observation that HIV(+) GCB DLBCL tumors have higher expression of proliferation genes and the Ki67 antigen than their HIV(-) counterparts, the results of this study also reveal overexpression of TRFC/CD71 mRNA in HIV(+) GCB DLBCL tumors compared to the HIV(-) cases. TFRC/CD71 is well known as a mediator of iron uptake in erythroid cells. Iron uptake through TFRC/CD71 is also necessary for, and positively regulates T and B cell proliferation; and is commonly expressed on aggressive B cell lymphomas. We suggest that TFRC/CD71 may play a role in the enhanced proliferative capabilities of HIV(+) GCB DLBCL. These effects may be mediated through the HIV protein Nef, which has known effects on TFRC/CD71 protein recycling in lymphoid populations (Madrid et al, J Biol Chem 2005), and has been shown to be transferred from HIV infected macrophages to uninfected B-cells via contact-dependent cellular conduits (Xu et al, Nat Immunol 2009). Nef transfer between cells has also been described to occur via microvesicle transfer and trogocytosis (reviewed in Ellwanger et al, Infect Genet Evol 2017). Further analysis of these pathways is ongoing. Disclosures Rimsza: NanoSting: Patents & Royalties: Named inventor on a patent licensed to NanoSting [Institution].",
