    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1136 Introduction: Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited bleeding disorder characterized by an impaired platelet aggregation and variable bleeding tendency. Inherited genetic mutations in integrin alpha IIb and beta3 (ITGA2B, ITGB3) result in a heterogeneity of the thrombasthenia phenotypes. It is phenotypically expressed in homozygotes or compound heterozygotes, given that 50% of normal aIIbb3 is sufficient to guarantee unimpaired platelet function that result in asymptomatic carriers. Defects in ITGB3 result in failure of binding of B3 and alpha IIb. These defects had been reported in Arabs (Iraqi Jews). We are reporting some results of Saudi GT genotype project. Materials & Methods: In this study, we analyzed the entire coding region ITGB3 gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing with primers specifically designed to amplify the coding region of exon 1\u201315 and exon /Intron boundaries in a cohort of 51 GT patients diagnosed and treated in our institute. Results: Out of 51 cases from 20 families had mutational screening of the ITGB3 gene with the aim to detect the causative pathogenic mutations to enable the pre-symptomatic diagnosis in at risk family members. In this study we detect 1 novel germline mutation c.2190delC (p.Ser703fs) in exon 13. The mutation is predicted to result in premature stop codon and protein truncation. The mutation was detected in 6 patients in homozygous stat (3 males and 3 females). Three tested samples from the patients family members detected the mutation in heterozygous state and all of them were asymptomatic with normal PFA and Intact expression of Platelet Glycoprotiens CD41(Gpllb), CD42a(GPIX), CD42b(GPlb), and CD61(Gpllla). All the GT patients with this mutation were type I GT with Prolonged PFA and complete absence of CD41(Gpllb) and CD61(Gpllla) glycoprotein. Conclusion: The result of this study represents the first Molecular analysis of ITGB3 gene in Saudi Arabia and displays the existence of novel pathogenic and possibly a founder effect in Saudi families.
