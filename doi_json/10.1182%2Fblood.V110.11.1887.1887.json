    "abstract_text": "ASCT has been reported as a feasible, safe and effective treatment in HIV-Ly patients (pts) receiving Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART). We hereby present an updated analysis of the EBMT experience on HIV-Ly pts treated with an ASCT since 1999. Sixty eight pts from 20 institutions [56 (82%) males, median age of 41 (29\u201362) years] were included. Twenty-two pts met AIDS criteria (other than lymphoma) at the time of HIV-Ly diagnosis. Forty-nine pts were diagnosed of NHL (31 DLBCL; 8 Burkitt/Burkitt-like; 4 plasmablastic; 3 anaplastic, 3 PTCL), 80% of them presenting with stage >II and 18 pts of HL, 61% of them presenting with stage >II. Median (range) lines of therapy before ASCT was 2 (1\u20135). Thirty-five pts were autografted in CR (16 in CR1), 25 in chemosensitive disease and 8 in chemoresistant disease. Sixty-five pts received the BEAM protocol as a conditioning regimen and the remaining three received TBI-based protocols. Two pts received more than 1 ASCT (censored at time of 2 nd ASCT). At the time of ASCT the median number of CD4+ cells was 162 (8\u20131159)/mcl and 34 pts had undetectable HIV viral loads. HAART was given in 55/57 pts during conditioning but withdrawn in 25% of them. The median number of CD34+ cells infused was 4.5 (1.6\u201321.2) \u00d710 6 /kg and G-CSF was used until engraftment in 60/67 pts for a median of 8 (2\u201321) days. All pts but one who died on day +15 reached neutrophils>500/ml at a median time of 11 (8\u201336) days. Platelet count >20.000/ml was reached in 61 pts at a median time of 14 (6\u2013455) days. Twenty three pts (34%) died: disease-progression (n=15), acute ASCT-related complications (n=6) [bacterial infections (n=4), multi-organ failure (n=1), other complications (n=1)] and 2 pts died from HIV-related complications. Cumulative incidence of NRM was 4.4% (95%CI 1.5\u201313.3) and 7.6% (95%CI 3.3\u201317.6) at 3 and 12 months, respectively. Age > 50 years at ASCT [RR 4.37 (95%CI 1.01\u201318.89), p = 0.05] was the only independent adverse prognostic factor for NRM. Relapse occurred in 19 (28%) pts giving a cumulative incidence of 23.6% (15.2\u201336.9) and 29.6% (20.0\u201343.8) at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Median time to progression was 4.5 (0.5\u201332) months. Histology (NHL other than DLBCL) [RR 3.2 (95%CI 1.0\u20139.6), p = 0.04], the use of >2 previous treatment lines [RR 2.7 (95%CI 1.0\u20137.2), p = 0.05] and not being in CR at ASCT [RR 3.5 (95%CI 1.2\u20139.7), p = 0.02] were significantly associated with a higher risk of relapse post-ASCT. With a median follow up time of 32 (2\u201381) months, PFS and OS were 56% (CI95% 43\u201370) and 61% (CI95% 48\u201374) at 3 years, respectively. Pts with refractory disease showed a poorer OS [RR 5.1 (95%CI 1.8\u201314.6), p = 0.002] and PFS [RR 5.3 (95%CI 2.0\u201313.7), p = 0.001]. One pt developed an in-situ epithelioma and myelodisplastic syndrome (+4y) and another one a kidney adenocarcinoma (+3y). The results of the largest experience on ASCT for HIV-Ly indicate that this approach is a useful treatment in terms of NRM, long-term OS, and PFS, with significantly better results in patients autografted with chemosensitive disease.",
