    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3174 Poster Board III-114 Fibrinogen is the zymogen precursor to the main structural protein in blood coagulation, and is proteolytically activated during coagulation to form fibrin clots. Fibrinogen is an acute phase protein that is produced by the liver, and elevated fibrinogen levels are a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke. Fibrinogen is synthesized from three separate genes, FGA, FGB, and FGG encoding the A\u03b1a, B\u03b2, and \u03b3 chains, respectively. Several inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6), are known to up-regulate fibrinogen synthesis, while interleukin-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1a, and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 are known to antagonize IL-6 stimulation of fibrinogen synthesis. Here we report that interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), a cytokine that is highly expressed in atherosclerotic lesions, decreases the production of fibrinogen by two-fold over a 24 hour period in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, both at the protein and mRNA level. In addition, IFN-\u03b3 antagonizes IL-6 up-regulation of fibrinogen production. Since IFN-\u03b3 is known to signal via the IFN-\u03b3 receptor through a STAT1-dependent pathway, we investigated the mechanism by which IFN-\u03b3 inhibits fibrinogen production. We identify a previously unknown IFN-\u03b3 activation sequence (GAS), AGGAGCTTACATAAAGGGACAA, within the promoter of the human \u03b3 chain gene FGG. This sequence is homologous to the known GAS consensus sequence TTNCNNNAA. Nuclear extracts from IFN-\u03b3-stimulated HepG2 cells, but not from unstimulated HepG2 cells, form a complex with oligonucleotides containing this GAS sequence, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The formation of this complex is blocked by unlabeled competing oligonucleotides and by an antibody to phosphorylated STAT1. The involvement of pSTAT1 in this complex is consistent with the known role of pSTAT1 downstream of IFN-\u03b3 receptor signaling. In addition, IFN-\u03b3 stimulates STAT1 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, using an FGG promoter construct fused to a luciferase reporter gene in transiently transfected HepG2 cells, we show that IFN-\u03b3 inhibits luciferase expression in a dose-dependent manner. Together, these data demonstrate that IFN-\u03b3 down-regulation of fibrinogen production occurs through a pSTAT1-mediated pathway. Since IFN-\u03b3 is known to demonstrate both pro and anti-atherogenic actions, this down-regulation of fibrinogen production may serve an anti-atherogenic function in vivo.
