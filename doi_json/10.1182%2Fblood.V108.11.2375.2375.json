    "abstract_text": "Gene expression profiling has provided new insights into the understanding of mature B cell neoplasms by relating each one to its normal counterpart, so that they can be to some extent classified according to the corresponding normal B-cell stage. Thus, diffuse large B cell (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL) have been related to a germinal center precursor whereas mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) are more likely to derive from nai\u0308ve and memory B cell, respectively. However, little is still known about the physiopathology of B-cell lymphomas and particularly the deregulated pathways involved in their oncogenesis. To further investigate that point, we performed laser capture microdissection (LCM) of the three anatomic lymphoid compartments (i.e germinal center, mantle zone and marginal zone) taken from nine normal spleens and lymph nodes and magnetic cell separation of the four normal B cell subpopulations (i.e nai\u0308ve B cells, centroblasts, centrocytes and memory B cells) purified from twelve normal tonsils for gene expression profiling by cDNA microarray. These molecular profiles have been compared to those of the four most frequent mature B cell neoplasms in adult (i.e DLBCL, FL, MZL and MCL), each one isolated from five previously untreated patients. Unsupervised analysis by hierarchical clustering of the normal anatomic and cellular populations could discriminate the germinal from the extra-germinal populations by genes involved in cell proliferation (e.g. E2F5, CCNB2, BUB1B and AURKB), DNA repair (e.g. PCNA and EXO1), cytokine secretion (e.g. IL8, IL10RB, IL4R and TGFBI) and apoptosis (e.g. CASP8, CASP10, BCL2 and FAS). Supervised analysis of the comparison between each B-cell lymphoma and its anatomic and cellular physiologic equivalent identified molecular deregulations concerning several genes\u2019families characterizing the different histologic subtypes. Genes associated with cellular adhesion and ubiquitin cycle were significantly up-regulated in MCL (FCGBP, ITGAE, USP7, VCAM1) and MZL (CTGF, CDH1, ITGAE) whereas germinal center derived lymphomas (i.e. DLBCL and FL) mainly showed up-regulation of genes involved in cell proliferation (TNFRSF17, SEPT8) and immune response (FCER1G, XBP1, IL1RN). Few deregulated genes were common to the four subtypes, principally associated with cell proliferation (CYR61, GPNMB), cytosqueleton organization (EPB41L3) and carbohydrates metabolism (GNPDA1), suggesting potential similar oncogenic pathways. Those preliminary results are compatible with both subtype-specific and overall mechanisms of lympomagenesis and should be verified in a wider range of samples to confirm the oncogenic events involved in this heterogeneous disease."
