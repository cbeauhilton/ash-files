    "abstract_text": "Background: Acalabrutinib (acala) is a next-generation, highly selective, covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor approved for patients (pts) with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received \u22651 prior therapy. The efficacy and safety of acala in relapsed/refractory (R/R) MCL pts was demonstrated in a single-arm phase 2 study (ACE-LY-004; NCT02213926) after a median follow-up of 26 mo (Wang M, et al. Leukemia . 2019;33:2762-6). Here, we present results after an additional year of follow-up. Methods: Adults with MCL and ECOG PS \u22642 who had relapsed or were refractory to 1-5 prior therapies, had no prior BTK/BCL-2 inhibitor exposure, and did not require warfarin/vitamin K antagonists, received oral acala 100 mg twice daily until progressive disease (PD) or toxicity. Overall response rate (ORR; investigator-assessed partial response [PR] or better per Lugano classification), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety were assessed. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was analyzed in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples and peripheral blood by next-generation sequencing (5x10 -6 ) in pts with available paired samples. Results: 124 pts were included (median age, 68 [range: 42-90] y; ECOG PS \u22641, 93%; bulky lymph nodes \u226510 cm, 8%; extranodal involvement, 72%; intermediate-/high-risk simplified MCL International Prognostic Index score, 44%/17%; median number of prior therapies, 2 [range: 1-5]; refractory disease, 24%). After a median follow-up of 38.1 mo (range: 0.3-59.5), 24 (19%) pts remain on treatment and an additional 31 pts (55 total; 44%) remain in follow-up for survival. Of the 31 pts in post-acala follow-up, 6 remain PD-free (4 received post-acala treatment: anticancer treatment combinations and allogeneic stem cell transplant [n=3]; radiotherapy [n=1]). ORR was 81% (95% CI: 74, 88); 48% (95% CI: 39, 57) achieved complete response (CR). Median DOR was 28.6 mo (95% CI: 17.5, 39.1) and the estimated 36-mo DOR rate was 41.9% (95% CI: 31.7, 51.8). Median PFS was 22.0 mo (95% CI: 16.6, 33.3; Figure ); estimated 36-mo PFS rate was 37.2% (95% CI: 28.2, 46.1). ORR and PFS were not significantly different between subgroups divided by Ki-67 index (\u226450%, >50%); PFS also did not differ significantly by prior treatment regimen (bendamustine/rituximab [BR]-based, non-BR) or prior therapy line (1, 2, \u22653). Median OS was not reached; estimated 36-mo OS rate was 60.5% (95% CI: 51.1, 68.7). Of 30 MRD-evaluable pts, 6 (20%) achieved CR and undetectable MRD (uMRD) and maintained uMRD at last assessment. The adverse event (AE) profile was largely unchanged with an additional year of follow-up. The most frequent AEs (\u226520%) of headache (39%), diarrhea (37%), fatigue (30%), cough (23%), myalgia (22%), and nausea (22%) were primarily grade 1/2. Grade 3/4 AEs (\u22655%) were neutropenia (11%), anemia (10%), and pneumonia (6%). Overall, 16 pts (13%) had cardiac AEs (11 with prior cardiac risk factors); 3 of the 16 pts had cardiac AEs in the last year of follow-up (grade 3/4: n=2). Overall, 6 pts (5%) had grade 3/4 cardiac AEs (acute coronary syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, complete atrioventricular block, cardiac failure, cardiorespiratory arrest, coronary artery disease, sinus arrest; n=1 each). One pt had grade 3/4 hypertension in the last year (total any grade, n=5 [4%]; total grade 3/4, n=2 [2%]). Five pts had bleeding AEs in the last year (n=46 [37%] total) including 2 with grade 3/4 AEs of gastrointestinal hemorrhage (n=2 total) and 1 with grade 3/4 subdural hematoma (n=1 total). Three pts had grade 3/4 infections in the last year (n=21 [17%] total). Treatment discontinuation was primarily due to PD (n=74; 60%) and AEs (n=14; 11%). Seventeen AEs led to discontinuation in 14 pts; each AE occurred in only 1 pt. There were 57 deaths (46%), most commonly due to PD (n=38; 31%) or AEs (n=6; 5%); 14 deaths (11%) occurred in the last year of follow-up (PD, n=9; other, n=1; unknown, n=4). There were 6 deaths due to AEs (bilateral pulmonary embolism, critical aortic stenosis, myelodysplastic syndrome, pneumonia, suicide, non-small cell lung cancer); none were related to acala. Conclusion: Extended follow-up demonstrates no emerging safety concerns for acala in R/R MCL pts. After a median of 38.1 mo, 19% of pts remain on acala. Overall, an estimated one-third of pts remain progression free at 36 mo, with median OS not yet reached. These data support long-term use of acala in R/R MCL pts.
