    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4964 [Background and Purpose]: Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine with hypomethylating and cytotoxic activity. Although azacitidine is currently approved for subcutaneous (SC) injection and intravenous(IV) administration for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in the US, there are limited data available on the treatment effects of IV versus SC administration. To compare the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of IV with SC administration, a phase I/II study of azacitidine in Japanese patients with MDS was conducted. [Patients and Method]: Patients with RA, RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RAEB, or RAEB-t defined by the French-American-British (FAB) classification were enrolled. RA and RARS must fulfill the additional criteria of significant marrow dysfunction (defined by cytopenias and/or transfusion requirements). Eligible patients were at least 20 years of age but younger than 80 and had a ECOG PS between 0 and 2. The patients were alternately assigned to receive azacitidine SC or IV (10-minutes) at 75 mg/m 2 /day for 7 days every 4 weeks for a minimum of 4 cycles. Patients who achieved a complete response (CR) received additional 3 cycles of azacitidine and were followed up without treatment. Subjects with a partial response (PR) or hematologic improvement (HI) received azacitidine until disease progression with a maximum of 18 cycles. Ten patients received azacitidine by both SC and IV administration on the different cycle and PK parameters were compared on day 1 of each cycle. The primary endpoints of this study were the safety, PK and HI according to the International Working Group (IWG 2006) criteria for MDS, respectively. [Results]: A total of 54 patients (10 in phase I portion and 44 in phase II portion) were enrolled between October 2007 and November 2008. Of these, 53 patients received at least one dose of azacitidine; 17 patients (32 %) were female; the median age was 65 years (range 35\u201377 years). FAB MDS subtypes were: RA (16/53, 30%); RARS (3/53, 6%); RAEB (20/53, 38%); RAEB-t (14/53, 26%). IPSS risk groups were: Low (0%); Int-1(23/53, 43%); Int-2(15/53, 28%); High(15/53, 28%). IPSS cytogenetic groups were: good (24/53, 45%); intermediate (13/53, 25%); poor (16/53, 30%). Fifty-one patients have completed the treatment protocol to date. The median number of treatment cycles was 7(range 1 \u2013 18). Seven patients have completed 18 cycles of treatment. Two patients are continuing to receive treatment in their cycles 16 and 17. HI was observed in 53% (26/49) of patients. Median time to HI was 55 days (range 20\u2013217). Of the 27 patients who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline, 15 (56%) became transfusion independent. Hematologic response (CR, PR, or marrow CR) was achieved in 29% (15/51) of patients. Median time to hematologic response was 113 days (range 49\u2013247). HI rate in SC and IV administration was 50 % (12/24) and 56 % (14/25), respectively. Hematologic response rate in SC and IV administration was 29% (7/24) and 30% (8/27), respectively. There were no significant differences between SC and IV administration of azacitidine for HI and hematologic response. The Cmax following IV administration was approximately 4-fold of that obtained following SC administration; however, the AUC(0-\u221e) following SC administration was 92.3 \u00b1 15.8% compared to that of IV, indicating good bioavailability following SC administration. Overall, the PK profile was similar to that of the previously reported study. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events included neutropenia 80% (41/51), leukopenia 76% (39/51), hemoglobin decreased 71% (36/51) and thrombocytopenia 65% (33/51). Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic adverse events which were observed more than 10% included pneumonia 12% (6/51) and hypophosphatemia 16%(8/51). There was no death during the study that occurred within 29 days of last dose of azacitidine. The safety profile did not differ significantly different between SC and IV administration with the exception of injection site reactions observed with SC administration, only. [Conclusions]: Azacitidine is generally well tolerated and demonstrated a beneficial effect in Japanese patients with MDS. The higher Cmax of IV dose was not translated into clinical outcomes; no difference was shown in both efficacy and safety profiles between SC and IV administration. Both IV and SC azacitidine are promising therapeutic options for Japanese patients with MDS. Disclosures: Kobayashi: Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd.: Research Funding.
