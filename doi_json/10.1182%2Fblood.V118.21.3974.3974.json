The purpose of this study was to assess how high cut-off (HCO) dialysers are being used internationally to achieve this target. Methods: Data was collected for 54 patients, from 18 centers in 10 countries. Clinical presentation and treatment parameters, including details of removal of FLCs with high cut off hemodialysis and chemotherapy treatment, were captured using a web-based collection database. Demographics: All patients were Caucasian, median age of 65 years (range 43\u201381). Median biochemistry at presentation was: GFR of 8mls/min/1.73m 2 (1\u201327). creatinine 633.5\u03bcmol (168\u20132263); calcium 2.3mmol/L (0.91\u20133.83); albumin 34g/L (14\u201346) and \u03b22M 9.45mg/L (0\u201355.7). Baseline monoclonal \u03ba and \u03bb FLCs levels were: 5070mg/L (range 2250\u201320200) and 4200mg/L (range 300\u201313300), respectively. Of the patients who received a renal biopsy, 81% had myeloma kidney as their primary diagnosis. For initial chemotherapy prescriptions: 78% received bortezomib and 34% received thalidomide. 68.75% of the patients were treated with the Theralite HCO dialyzer; the other 31.25% received treatment with the HCO1100 dialyzer. There was a total of 626 HCO dialysis sessions recorded, with each patient receiving on average 13 session each (median, range 3\u201335) treatments per patient. Of the 54 patients, only 3 were treated with HDF. Results: 73.2% of patients demonstrated a decreased serum FLC level over the course of treatment, with 86.7% of these patients demonstrated decreased levels by day 12. The median FLC reduction achieved was 72.96% (15.09\u201399.62%) by day 12 and 93.03% (40.23\u201399.96%) by the last dialysis treatment. There was no difference in the percentage FLC reduction achieved between bortezomib (median: total 94.09%, day 12 79.14%) and thalidomide (median: total 77.65%, day 12 66.51%) treatment groups (total p=0.179, day 12 p=0.300). FLC removal was significantly increased in patients receiving Theralite treatment over those receiving HCO1100 at both day 12 (p=0.030) and by the end of treatment (p=0.031) Dialysis independence occurred in 68.2% of patients, median time 32 days (10\u2013249). Patients who became independent of dialysis had significantly greater reductions in serum FLC by day 12 (p=0.032). No significant adverse events related to the study device were reported. Conclusion: Reducing FLC in patients with myeloma kidney is associated with increased levels of dialysis independence. This study adds further evidence that a combination of chemotherapy and FLC removal by HCO hemodialysis improves patient outcomes following acute kidney injury secondary to multiple myeloma.
