    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Prognosis in patients with post allogeneic HCT-early relapse of AML is dismal and response to salvage treatment is less than 20%. Venetoclax has been shown to be safe and efficacious in frail/elderly patients with AML. Treatment results in an increase of pro-apoptotic function, thus the addition of alloreactive T cells may augment the anti-leukemic potency. We hypothesized that the combination of donor lymphocyte infusion may further enhance this response. Methods: Eligibility criteria for this protocol were - age>18 y, early (<6 months post allogeneic HCT) relapse and no concurrent GVHD. Venetoclax was administered at a daily dose of 400 mg for up to 6 cycles with DLI in escalating doses for up to 4 doses. Additional chemotherapy was allowed according to physician discretion. Primary endpoint of study included assessment Overall response (CR/CRi/CRp) rate at 3 months post treatment. Secondary endpoints included 1-year OS, rate of acute and chronic GVHD, documented infections, hematological complications, and other safety measures. Results: From January 2017 until May 2019, 19 patients were given the study protocol. Median age was 60 (43-75) years, Table . There were no cases of tumor lysis syndrome. Microbiology documented infections occurred in 5 patients (26%) and 2 patients were admitted during protocol (10%). No cases of significant bleeding were observed, and majority of patients were able to tolerate the protocol without any admissions. Acute GVHD was observed in 2 (10%) patients and chronic GVHD was observed in 4 (21%) patients. Overall response was observed in 8 (47%) patients (CR, n=3; CRi, n=2; CRp, n=3). Median time to response was 28 (18-67) days (median number of courses 2 (1-6)) and duration of response was 106 (31-395) days. Survival at 6 months was 3.5 months (95% CI 1.5-5.5). Median survival of patients achieving complete remission was 16.2 months (CI not det.), Figure . On univariate analysis there was no association between patients and disease's characteristics and overall survival, however any type of GVHD (entered to the model as a time dependent variable) was associated with a lower rate of mortality (HR=0.2, p= .03). Conclusions: These results may endorse the hypothesis that enhancing alloreactivity as a therapy may lead to a chemotherapy free approach to relapsed AML. A phase 2 study is under preparation with a larger sample size and a standardized approach to additional salvage chemotherapy added versus Venetoclax + DLI regimen only for a more robust analysis of this therapeutic approach.
