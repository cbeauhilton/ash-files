    "abstract_text": "Background : Carfilzomib (CFZ) is a novel proteasome inhibitor of the epoxyketone class that exhibits a high level of selectivity for the proteasome and has been shown in a phase 1 study to result in greater than 80% proteasome inhibition on a QDx2 consecutive day schedule. We piloted this agent in MM patients with relapsed and refractory disease, who had failed bortezomib (BTZ) and at least one immunomodulatory (IMiD) agent, e.g., thalidomide (THAL) and/or lenalidomide (LEN). Method s: PX-171-003 is an open-label, multicenter study enrolling pts with MM who have relapsed from at least 2 prior therapies and who are refractory; defined as progressing on or within 60 days of last therapy or<25% response to the last therapy. Pts received CFZ 20 mg/m 2 IV Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16 every 28 days, for up to 12 cycles. Dexamethasone 4 mg po was administered prior to each dose in Cycle 1. Responses were evaluated by the International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma. Clinical benefit response (CBR) was defined as complete response (CR) + partial/very good partial response (PR/VGPR) + minimal response (MR, as defined by EBMT criteria). Responses were adjudicated by an independent review committee. Results : 46 pts were enrolled, including 78% with progression on or within 60days of last therapy and 22% with no response to last therapy. 39 pts initiated treatment, completed at least one cycle of CFZ, had measurable M-protein, and were evaluable (eval) for response. The mean number of prior therapies (excluding transplant) was 6.4(range 1 to 18). 100% of pts received prior BTZ, 91% prior THAL, 89% prior LEN, and 83% prior stem cell transplantation (SCT). To date, pts received a median of 3 cycles(range 1\u20139) of CFZ; 22 started at least 4 cycles. The CBR was 26% (10/39 eval pts), including 5 pts achieving PR, 5 pts achieving MR, and 16 additional patients achieving stable disease (SD). Time to response was rapid, frequently occurring in the 1 st cycle. CFZ was generally well tolerated; the most common adverse events (AEs) were fatigue(65%), nausea (37%), upper respiratory infection (37%), and diarrhea (33%). Worsening of hematologic parameters: anemia (65%); thrombocytopenia (46%) and neutropenia(20%) were predominantly Grades 1 and 2. Increased creatinine, both drug and non-drug related, was seen in 15/46 pts (33%), but treatment was discontinued in only 3 patients due to a renal adverse event. Acute renal failure was documented in 4 pts (9%), 2 (4%) of whom also had possible tumor lysis. 78% of pts had Grade 1 or 2 peripheral neuropathy (PN) at baseline. Exacerbation of PN was rare, and there were no study discontinuations or dose reductions due to PN. Conclusions : In the context of this heavily pre-treated MM population, single agent CFZ was able to induce CBR in 26% of MM patients, the majority of whom had failed BTZ, LEN, THAL, and SCT. CFZ was generally well-tolerated, and toxicities were manageable. Importantly, exacerbation of pre-existing PN was rare and did not result in dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy. These observations support further evaluation of CFZ as a promising new agent in MM. Enrollment is proceeding at an escalated dose (based on tolerability) in this trial. Additional studies of CFZ in patients who are less heavily pretreated and in combination with other chemotherapy agents are ongoing.",
