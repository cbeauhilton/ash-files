    "abstract_text": "Background: MDSs are clonal hematopoietic stem cell malignancies characterized by cytopenias resulting from ineffective hematopoiesis. A phase 2 study of lenalidomide (MDS-002) demonstrated hematological improvement in patients with MDS without an associated deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality ( List AF, et al. Haematologica  2006 ; 91 [suppl1]: 379 [abst 1032] ). We now report multicenter results after \u30092 yrs follow-up. Methods: A total of 214 pts with transfusion-dependent anemia were categorized into the following IPSS MDS risk groups after central review of bone marrow morphology, karyotype, and peripheral blood findings: Low/Int-1 (168 [78%]); Int-2/High (8 [4%]); and unclassified (38 [18%]). Patients were unclassified for missing or inadequate marrow studies for central review (morphology [29] or cytogenetic [7]) or other diagnoses (AML [1], atypical CML [1]). Patients were evaluated for frequency and duration of red blood cell transfusion independence (RBC-TI) (IWG criteria), hemoglobin (Hgb) response, and safety. The starting dose of lenalidomide was 10 mg (daily or daily \u00d7 3 wks q28d cycle). Results: Overall, 56 (26%) of 214 enrolled patients achieved RBC-TI. Median time to RBC-TI was 5 wks, median duration of RBC-TI response was 41.0 wks (range, 8.0\u2013136.4), and median Hgb increase achieved during RBC-TI was 3.2 g/dL (range, 1.0\u20139.8). An additional 36 patients experienced a \u2265 50% reduction in RBC transfusions (overall hematological improvement in 92 [43%] patients). Overall, 47 (22%) patients had an abnormal karyotype at baseline and 9 (19%) patients achieved a cytogenetic response (4 complete). The most common drug-related grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (25% and 20%, respectively). Deep vein thrombosis occurred in only 2 (1%) patients. The duration of RBC-TI was \u2265 52 weeks in 21 (38%) patients. Among these 21 patients, 14 (67%) did not require a lenalidomide dose reduction during the first 52 weeks of treatment. Analyses of response variables will be presented. Dose-limiting neutropenia/thrombocytopenia was not reported after 52 weeks. The most commonly reported AEs after 52 weeks were mild-moderate diarrhea and fatigue (38% and 29%, respectively). Conclusion: Lenalidomide is an active, well-tolerated treatment in MDS patients with transfusion-dependent anemia that is not associated with a deletion 5q abnormality. The rate of erythroid hematologic improvement and duration of RBC-TI is encouraging and offers a possible alternative to cytokine therapy."
