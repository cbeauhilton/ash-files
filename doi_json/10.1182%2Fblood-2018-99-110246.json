    "abstract_text": "Objective: Studies demonstrated that inappropriate usage of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is associated with adverse reaction and poor health outcome in the hospitalized patients. Reducing inappropriate FFP administration in the inpatient settings can minimize potential for adverse events, and foster controllable cost expenditure. Guideline regarding indication of FFP transfusion is scarce. We aimed to assess the appropriateness of FFP transfusion in the setting of community teaching hospital. Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients received FFP transfusion in two community teaching hospitals between 2016-2017 were included in our study. Frequency of appropriateness of FFP transfusion was reported. We also reported percent increase from previous years to compare the FFP usage from 2010-2011 to 2016-2017. Results: Of 138 patients received FFP transfusion in 2016-2017, 62% (86 patients) received inappropriate transfusion. 18% of patients received FFP to correct high INR (>1.6) requiring emergency surgery. 53% of the patients received inappropriate transfusion for bleeding in 2016-2017 compared to 25% in 2010-2011. There was 10% rise of inappropriate or overuse of FFP transfusion in 2016-2017 than 2010-2011. Conclusion: Inappropriate FFP transfusion is significantly associated with adverse health outcome and increased healthcare cost. This study justifies the need for continuous audit for appropriate use of FFP. View large Download slide View large Download slide  Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
