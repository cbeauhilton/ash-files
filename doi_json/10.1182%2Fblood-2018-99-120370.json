    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an uncommon subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with distinguishes clinical, biologic, and molecular characteristics. The MCL-International Prognostic Index (MIPI) incorporates age, EGOC performance status, normalized LDH level and WBC and has improved discriminatory power. The aim of this retrospective single-center study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and response to treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma. Methods : This single center retrospective study included 297 adult patients diagnosed with MCL between December 2005 and May 2018. The diagnosis of MCL was rendered in accordance with the later World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Outcome was determined as response to treatment, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) by Kaplan-Meier analysis using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics 21; IBM Corp., Chicago, IL) statistical tool kit. We also compared the PFS and OS according to simplified MIPI (s-MIPI) index. Results : All clinical data were available in 149 cases and these patients were further evaluated. There were 38 (26%) female and 208 (74%) male patients. The median age at diagnosis of MCL was 66 years (range, 31-93 years). The median time of follow-up was 14.5 months (range, 3-139.3 months). The median s-MIPI was 6 points (range 2-11). Most patients were in the high-risk group (62.2%). Induction chemotherapy was administered in 128/146 patients and remaining two patients had deceased after diagnosis of MCL. Altogether 115 out of 146 patients (78.8%) were treated with a combination of chemotherapy and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab.One elderly patient received Rituximab immunotherapy only. The majority (56.5%) of the patients received CHOP with rituximab as induction chemotherapy. Thirty-one patients underwent ASCT after remission was obtained in relapse setting. Sixty-four patients (43.8%) had bone marrow involvement and 23 patients (15.7%) had extra-nodal involvement. In total 40 patients (41.2%) achieved a complete remission (CR) with an overall response rate of 63.9% after the induction therapy. During follow up, 20 relapses and 28 deaths were noted. Infection was the most common cause of death (50%). Following ASCT, OS was significantly improved; estimated median OS in transplant cohort was 115.7 months vs. 60 months compare with non-transplant group (p=0.013) (Figure-2). According to the long-rank test, estimated 5-year OS was not significantly different between intermediate-risk and high-risk s-MIPI categories (72.4%\u00b11.2% vs. 72.6%\u00b10.7%; p=0,202). Estimated 5-year PFS was significantly different between intermediate-risk and high-risk s-MIPI cohorts (47.1%\u00b11.3% vs. 33%\u00b110.3%; p=0,05). Among the transplanted patients, there is no differences between the OS of s-MIPI groups (p=0.952). No patient died or progressed in the low-risk group. Conclusion: We have confirmed the validity of the MIPI and simplifed MIPI for the prognosis of patients with MCL even in the era of rituximab. e general results of both indexes are fully comparable, facilitating the broad application of s-MIPI as a simple bedside prognostic tool.
