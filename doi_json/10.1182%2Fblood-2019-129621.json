    "abstract_text": "Background : Patients (pt) with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) with FLT3 mut have poor prognosis. FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i) as single agent, and in combination improve outcomes in FLT3 mut AML. However, recent clinical trials of FLT3i have had different inclusion criteria, and determinants of outcomes with FLT3i are not well known. Methods : We conducted a retrospective study to determine factors affecting outcomes in FLT3 mut R/R AML with first salvage therapy. We reviewed medical records of R/R FLT3 mut AML pts for data regarding prior therapy, salvage regimen and outcomes. Univariate analysis and multivariate Cox analysis were performed to evaluate the association of baseline covariates and outcomes. Evaluated baseline factors included ECOG PS, ELN cytogenetic risk group, FLT -ITD ratio, FLT3 -D835 mutation, frontline therapy factors including intensive chemotherapy (IC), hypomethylating agent (HMA), or non-intensive chemotherapy (NIC)-based regimen, anthracycline use, FLT3i use, stem-cell transplantation (SCT), response to frontline therapy, salvage regimen related factors including IC vs. HMA vs NIC-based regimen, FLT3i use, SCT, AML mutations, etc. Efficacy endpoints of interest included CR/CRi per modified IWG criteria for AML, overall survival (OS) and duration of response (DOR). Results : Between June 2002 and July 2019 we identified 202 pts with R/R FLT3 mut AML who received first salvage therapy at our institution with or without an FDA-approved or investigational FLT3i. The baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1 and treatment characteristics and outcomes are shown in Table 2 . The median follow-up duration was 54 months (mo, 95% CI 46-89) and median OS 7.9 mo (95% CI 6.2-9.8). 53 out of 105 responding pts relapsed and median DOR was 3.6 mo (95% CI 2.7-5.8). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed higher odds of achieving CR/CRi with salvage IC (OR 2.9), and IC+FLT3i (OR 8.1) compared to HMA, and RUNX1 mut was associated with lower odds of achieving CR/CRi compared to RUNX1 -WT (OR 0.06, Table 3 ). Single agent FLT3i as salvage therapy did not have significant association with CR/CRi or OS, as compared to HMA. Similarly, multivariate Cox model for analysis of factors associated with OS showed higher risk of death in pts who had received FLT3i in frontline setting (HR = 2.9) and pts with TET2 mut (HR = 2.2, Table 4 ). Different salvage regimens of IC, NIC, HMA with or without FLT3i, and single agent FLT3i did not show survival benefit compared to HMA alone. Pairwise comparison between salvage regimens for OS censored at SCT ( Fig. 1a-f ) showed HMA improved OS compared to IC (median OS 10.2 vs 6.4 HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.36-0.99, p=0.046). Addition of FLT3i to HMA or IC did not yield significantly different OS compared to single agent FLT3i ( Fig. 1 a-d ). On univariate analysis, there was no significant difference in DOR between salvage HMA vs other salvage therapies including IC, NIC, single agent FLT3i, and IC with FLT3i. Covariates not associated with CR/CRi or OS on univariate analysis included ECOG PS, ELN cytogenetic risk group, frontline HMA or IC, prior anthracycline, prior SCT, response to prior regimen, FLT3 -ITD ratio, FLT3 -D835, and other recurrent AML mutations. Hence, these factors were not included in the multivariate models. Limitations of this study included retrospective nature and small sample sizes in subgroups. Conclusions : This multivariate analysis of a large cohort of R/R FLT3 mut AML undergoing first salvage therapy showed association of RUNX1 mut with lower odds of achieving CR/CRi, and frontline FLT3i use and TET2 mut with worse OS. Both IC, and IC with FLT3i were associated with higher odds of achieving CR/CRi compared to HMAs. However, pairwise comparison of salvage regimens suggested improved OS with HMA compared to IC.
