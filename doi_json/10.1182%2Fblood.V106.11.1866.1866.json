    "abstract_text": "Several compounds currently in development for the treatment of thrombotic disorders demonstrate high levels of specificity for single targets of the blood coagulation cascade such as factor Xa and thrombin. However, development of a single molecule dual inhibitor against factor Xa and thrombin may expand the efficacy to safety ratio of treatment options for arterial and venous thrombosis. The objective of this study was to determine if simultaneous administration of PD 0313052, a selective Xa inhibitor and argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor, would lead to a synergistic antithrombotic effect in a rabbit AV shunt model of thrombosis. Intravenous administration of PD 0313052 alone at doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg/min resulted in thrombus weight (TW) reductions of 11\u00b13, 25\u00b110 and 67\u00b17 % compared to the vehicle group. Argatroban at 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg/min reduced TW 16\u00b113, 47\u00b110 and 75\u00b16 %. When PD 0313052 was administered at 0.1 mg/kg/min in combination with argatroban at 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg/min TW was reduced 50\u00b17, 60\u00b17 and 82\u00b19 %. Likewise, argatroban at 1 mg/kg/min combined with 0.1, 0.3 or 1mg/kg/min of PD 0313052 resulted in TW reductions of 56\u00b19, 60\u00b19 and 84\u00b15 %, respectively. At the lowest combined doses of PD 0313052 and argatroban there was no change in bleeding time relative to the additive fold-increases from each drug alone. The EC 50 of intravenously administered PD 0313052 and argatroban was 67\u00b123 and 178\u00b158 ng/ml, respectively. When the drugs were combined the EC 50 was reduced to 12\u00b16 ng/ml with the PD 0313052/argatroban combination and to 83\u00b129 ng/ml with the argatroban/PD 0313052 combination. A synergistic effect was also observed in an ex vivo assay of thrombin generation (TG). Predicted additive inhibition of TG based on the individual effects of each compound was \u22129\u00b17, 9\u00b12 and 29\u00b17 % compared to 10\u00b15, 32\u00b15 and 55\u00b13 % with the 313052/argatroban combination. The predicted effects of the argatroban/PD 0313052 combination was \u22129\u00b17, 1\u00b17 and 16\u00b19 % compared to the actual inhibition of 5\u00b13, 14\u00b15 and 31\u00b17 %. These results demonstrate a significant synergistic antithrombotic effect by combining low doses of a factor Xa and a thrombin inhibitor and support the hypothesis that development of a single molecule inhibitor against different hemostatic targets may offer greater efficacy in the prevention and treatment of venous and arterial thrombosis.",
