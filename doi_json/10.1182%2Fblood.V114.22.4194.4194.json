    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4194 Backgroud Autologous peripheral blood stem cells transplantation is widely used in treatment of malignant blood diseases, solid tumors and autoimmune diseases recently. Before apheresis, we filled the pipelines of Baxter CS-3000PLUS blood cell separator with the autologous blood instead of irradiated allogenetic blood. Objective The study is aimed to explore the safety and clinic efficacy of autologous blood donation for apheresis of stem cell in low body weight pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes. Method: There were three pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in our hospital between August 2007 and December 2007. These patients included 2 male and 1 female with age of 5, 9, 9 respectively. Their weight was 15,18 and 23.5 kilograms respectively. Their blood test indexes were HB>120g/L,HCT>34%. On the 14th day before apheresis, 100ml autologous blood was collected and preserved in 4\u00b0C. Mobilization program was CTX 2g/m 2 for 2 days and G-CSF 5\u223c10 \u03bcg/kg/d on the 5th day of before apheresis. Apheresis was initiated when WBC>5.0\u00d710 9 /L. SVSCH and SVCC were installed to blood cell separator at first. Before apheresis, we filled the pipelines of blood cell separator with the autologous blood instead of irradiated allogenetic blood. Result On the 9th day after the autologous blood donation, RBC ? AHB and HCT went back to the original level. In the process of apheresis.,every vital sign including blood pressure and heart rate was normal during apheresis. Hypotension or hyperthermia did not appear. The amount of CD34+ cell reached to 1.28-3.05\u00d7106/kg. Conclusion It is concluded that autologous blood donation is a safe and an effective method to avoid allogenetic blood transfusion for apheresis of stem cell in low body weight pediatric patients.
