    "abstract_text": "Abstract 191 A series of salicylamides, fully synthetic cationic foldamers designed to disrupt the binding of the pentasaccharide unit of heparin to antithrombin III, were found to be potent neutralizers of the activity of unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs). A compound from this series, PMX-60056, is currently in human clinical trials for neutralization of UFH and LMWHs. PMX-60056 potently neutralizes UFH and LMWHs but is not as efficacious versus fondaparinux (FPX). The goal of the present research was to 1) identify back-up compounds to optimize activity against the LMWHs and FPX and 2) mitigate the hemodynamic effects commonly associated with protamine and observed clinically with PMX-60056 in the absence of heparin. Compounds were first tested for their ability to neutralize the anticoagulant activity of enoxaparin (ENX), tinzaparin or FPX in an in vitro amidolytic assay for factor Xa activity. While only minor improvements were observed in the neutralization of ENX and tinzaparin, compounds were identified which had 6 to 40 fold increase in activity against FPX (EC50s of 0.09 \u2013 0.58 uM) in comparison to PMX-60056 (EC50 3.64 uM). Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assays demonstrated that these compounds maintained activity against heparin in a plasma based clotting assay. Rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM) was used to show that these compounds are able to neutralize heparin and ENX in human whole blood, restoring normal coagulation profiles. As an initial test for safety, compounds were tested in hemolysis and cytotoxicity assays using isolated human erythrocytes, a transformed human liver cell line (HepG2 cells) and a mouse fibroblast cell line (NIH3T3). Lead back-up compounds were not cytotoxic (or hemolytic) at >100 fold concentrations over their EC50 concentrations in the anti-coagulation assays, indicating a high selectivity index between toxicity and efficacy. Five compounds were selected for further studies based on their in vitro profiles. The in vivo efficacy of these compounds was evaluated in a rat coagulation model for neutralization of ENX (2 mg/kg). Three minutes following IV dosing with ENX, either saline, protamine or one of the five salicylamide test compounds was administered. Blood was collected before dosing with ENX, and at 1, 3, 10, and 60 min after dosing, for aPTT and factor Xa analysis. Three of the five salicylamides (PMX640, PMX686 and PMX747) were more efficacious than protamine; with PMX640 and PMX686 neutralizing 91 \u2013 100% and PMX747 neutralizing 78\u2013100% of the ENX anti-factor Xa activity over the entire 60 minute time course. In a second in vivo model, PMX747 and PMX686 (2 mg/kg) completely neutralized the prolonged bleeding times in a rat tail bleeding model caused by treatment with 2 mg/kg ENX. Significantly, with protamine at a 5 mg/kg dosage, only partial restoration was obtained. Protamine routinely causes a transient decrease in blood pressure upon dosing, and hemodynamic effects have also been observed with PMX-60056 in human subjects in the absence of heparin. To address this issue, structural features that have successfully reduced hemodynamic liabilities in other cationic compounds were incorporated into the design of the back-up salicylamides. The effect of compounds on blood pressure and heart rate was measured via arterial catheters in rats following IV administration of protamine, PMX-60056, or test agents. As expected, in rats treated with a low dose of UFH (50 u/kg) and high dosages of antagonist, both protamine and PMX-60056 displayed transient or prolonged blood pressure reductions at 8 and 16 mg/kg, respectively. However, the lead back-up salicylamides, PMX640, PMX686 and PMX747 had little to no effect on blood pressure at these same dosages. In conclusion, we have discovered compounds in the salicylamide series that have greater efficacy versus LMWHs and that have significantly reduced hemodynamic liabilities in rats as compared to protamine. Furthermore, these compounds potently neutralize FPX activity in vitro ; exceeding the activity of protamine and our clinical lead salicylamide, PMX-60056, by up to 40 fold. Thus we have been able to optimize the salicylamide series, identifying compounds that offer the potential to greatly improve upon the current clinical heparin antagonist, protamine, in respect to both activity against LMWHs and side effect profile.
