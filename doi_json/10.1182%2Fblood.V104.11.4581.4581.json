    "abstract_text": "Introduction The treatment of early stage Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma is controversial. Radiotherapy alone, chemotherapy alone or a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy are all considered effective options. Purpose The purpose of this study is to review the treatment approaches and outcomes used for early stage Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma over the past two decades at ORCC Methods Retrospective chart review of all patients with stage IA /IIA treated from 1984\u20132002 was performed. Patients were separated into three groups according to initial treatment modality: radiation alone (Rads), chemotherapy alone (Chemo), or combined modality (Combined). Disease-free survival and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Result Between May 1984 and January 2003, 172 patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (28% stage 1A, 72% stage 2A) were seen at our centre. Treatment was as follows: 49% Rads, 13% Chemo and 38% Combined. The median age was 33.7 years (range: 17 \u2013 82 years) and the median follow-up of 73 months (range: 3 \u2013 204 months). The 5-year disease free and overall survival rates for the entire group were 90% and 96 % respectively. The 5-year disease-free and overall survival by treatment modality was: Rads 87% and 93 %; Chemo 80 % and 100 %; Combined 97 % and 98%. In the Combined group, there was no difference in outcome between patients receiving involved-field radiation and those receiving extended-field radiotherapy. The relapse rate in a patient who received abbreviated chemotherapy and greater than four cycles was 4.3% (1 out of 23) and 2.4% (1 out of 41) respectively. The incidence of acute Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were 9 % and 0.5% respectively. Conclusions Our data confirms the excellent prognosis of early stage Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma with all the approaches used at our centre. At present, we favour combined modality treatment with involved-field radiotherapy and our results support its continued use."
