    "abstract_text": "The introduction of plasma exchange therapy in early 1970s significantly reduced the rate of mortality in patients affected by thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a disease characterized by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. A similar improvement was never achieved in the prevention of the disease recurrence. Still, 20\u201350% of patients, who survived the fatal disease, experience a relapse one month or even years after the acute episode of TTP. There is no pathognomic marker or laboratory test that can be used for the surveillance of TTP during remission and predict which patients will relapse. We have retrospectively analyzed for the first time at remission the role of ADAMTS13, anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies and von Willebrand Factor (VWF) in 109 patients who survived the acute episode of TTP. ADAMTS13 activity and ADAMTS13 antigen levels were measured as described by Gerritsen et al (TH 1999) and Feys HB et al. (JTH 2006), respectively. The total anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies (with and without neutralizing activity) were measured by western blot analysis and the presence of neutralizing anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies was checked according to Gerritsen et al (TH 1999). VWF antigen was measured using an ELISA assay and VWF multimers analysis was carried out using low-resolution SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis and exposing gels to human anti-VWF antibodies labeled with I125 for autoradiography (Ruggeri & Zimmerman, Blood 1981). All variables have been statistically analyzed in 2 subgroups of patients with or without TTP recurrence, in order to understand the role of each variable as a potential predictor marker for recurrence. Univariate and multivariate analysis were carried out to evaluate adjusted and unadjusted odds ratios (Ors) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as a measure of the relative risk of relapse associated with the risk factors under investigation. Our data showed that the median value of ADAMTS13 activity and antigen levels at remission were significantly lower in patients with recurrent TTP than in patients with no relapse (ADAMTS13 activity: 12% vs. 41%; p =0.007; ADAMTS13 antigen: 36% vs 58%; p =0.003). Furthermore, the prevalence of patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (\u226410%) was significantly higher in the group of patients who relapsed (OR=2.9 CI95% 1.3\u20136.8, p =0.01). The prevalence of anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies (with or without neutralizing activity) resulted to be significantly higher in patients with recurrent TTP (OR= 3.1 CI 95% 1.4\u20137.3, p =0.006). A higher VWF antigen levels or the presence of ultralarge VWF (ULVWF) multimers at remission did not increase the risk of recurrence ( p =0.4 for VWF:Ag and p =0.7 for ULVWF multimers). In conclusion, our data showed that the association of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency and the presence of anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies is a negative prognostic marker at remission and increases the relative risk of TTP recurrence by 3.6 times (OR=3.6 CI95% 1.4\u20139). Therefore our results would suggest that our efforts should go in the direction of maintenance therapy which aims at reducing or abolishing the presence of antibodies during remission and increasing the level of ADAMTS13 in plasma in order to prevent the recurrence of TTP."
