    "abstract_text": "Background : Pulmonary function is particularly susceptible to acute and chronic injury occurring in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA). Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS), a common and potentially fatal complication of SCA, can be the cause or the consequence of abnormal pulmonary function (Siddiqui & Ahmed, 2003). Use of hydroxyurea therapy (HU) is increasing for children with recurrent pulmonary complications, following the findings that HU reduces risk of ACS in adults (Charache et al, 1995). How HU may improve pulmonary function in children with SCA is still ill-defined. The purpose of this study was to assess the change observed on serial pulmonary function tests (PFT) for children prescribed HU for abnormal pulmonary function. Methods : Over 240 children with pulmonary complications, such as acute chest syndrome, reactive airway disease, and chronic hypoxia, have been evaluated in the Sickle Cell Pulmonary Clinic at Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta since beginning in July 2000. As part of the Clinic\u2019s standard of care, PFT were routinely attempted on children over the age of 5. A retrospective review of PFT results was done for the children with SCA and prior abnormal PFT. Children were included in the HU cohort (+HU) if repeat PFTs were available following > 3 months on HU therapy and if time on HU did not include frequent RBC transfusions. Children without history of HU therapy (\u2212HU) were selected for comparison. PFTs were performed on a standard plethysmograph. Paired t-test was used to evaluate observed differences. Results: Thirty-one children with prior abnormal PFT had test before and following prescription of HU. Their mean age was 12.6 (range 6\u201320) years and mean duration of HU was 21 (range 4\u201347) months at the time of the repeat PFT. Hematologic changes expected on HU occurred for all 31 children. Twenty-four children followed for abnormal PFT had no history of HU (\u2212HU) and matched the +HU group by gender, age (mean 12.3, range 7\u201319 years), duration followed at time of repeat PFT (mean 19, range 3\u201366 months; p=0.36), and initial hematologic parameters. Spirometry findings changed for +HU group, and remained stable for \u2212HU group. Mean FVC and FEV1 values improved significantly on HU, when compared to initial (PreHU) PFT and to \u2212HU controls. Conversion to a normal PFT, as interpreted by a pediatric pulmonologist masked to treatment status, occurred in 18 (58%) and 2 (8%) children in the +HU and \u2212HU groups, respectively.

Routine PFT assessments of children prescribed HU may serve as an objective measure of clinical response in children with SCA and pulmonary complications. These results will help in the design of future prospective studies examining the clinical benefits of HU therapy for children at risk for long-term pulmonary complications."
