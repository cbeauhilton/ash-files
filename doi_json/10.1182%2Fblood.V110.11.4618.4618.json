    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is frequently associated with various chromosomal abnormalities. \u20185q\u2212 syndrome\u2019 is low-risk MDS known as good responder of lenalidomide recently. However, the patients with other abnormalities in chromosome 5 showed quite different clinical features from those with \u20185q\u2212 syndrome\u2019. The aim of this study was a retrospective evaluation for Korean MDS patients with abnormalities in chromosome 5 other than \u20185q\u2212 syndrome\u2019. Materials and Methods: Among 456 patients with MDS diagnosed at 16 hospitals in Korea between 1996 and 2006, 370 with available cytogenetic data entered the study. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed. Results: Ninety three patients (25.1%) showed abnormalities in chromosome 5 and the \u20185q\u2212 syndorme\u2019 was only 10 patients (2.7%). Among the rest, 39 patients (10.5%) had various abnormalities other than 5q deletion such as translocation or 5 monosomy, 38 (10.3%) had complex abnormalities with 5q\u2212, and 2 had mosaic pattern with normal chromosome. Four patients had isolated 5q\u2212 but blasts in marrow were over 5%. The deletion of 5q was interstitial but with a predominance for 5q13-33 deletions (34.8%). MDS patients with chromosome 5 abnormalities other than \u20185q\u2212 syndrome\u2019 didn\u2019t share the clinical features with \u20185q\u2212 syndrome\u2019. There was no leukemic transformation in \u20185q\u2212 syndrome\u2019 group, but 18 (21.7%) with other abnormalities in chromosome 5 finally transformed to acute leukemia. Five year overall survival was significantly inferior in non-\u20195q\u2212 syndrome\u2019 patients than \u20185q\u2212 syndrome\u2019 (14.3% vs. 79.6%, P =0.0115). Conclusions: Patients with isolated 5q\u2212 and excess blast (>5%), other abnormalities than isolated 5q\u2212, or mosaic chromosome with isolated 5q\u2212 and normal chromosome didn\u2019t share the clinical features such as lower rate of leukemic transformation and long survival.",
