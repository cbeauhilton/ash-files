    "abstract_text": "De novo generation of HSCs has been described as a \"holy grail\" of stem cell biology, however the factors required for converting human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to true hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) capable of robust long-term engraftment have yet to be fully characterized. Two groups have shown that injection of PSCs into immunodeficient mice leads to teratomas containing niches producing hematopoietic progenitors capable of long-term engraftment. Once these hematopoietic progenitors and their microenvironments are better characterized, this system could be used as a model to help direct in vitro differentiation of PSCs to HSCs. Toward this end, we have injected human PSCs into immunodeficient mice expressing human rather than mouse M-CSF, IL-3, GM-CSF, and thrombopoietin, as well as both human and mouse versions of the \"don't eat me signal\" Sirpa (collectively termed MISTRG mice). These cytokines are known to support different aspects of hematopoiesis, and thrombopoietin in particular has been shown to support HSC maintenance, suggesting these mice may provide a better environment for human PSC-derived HSCs than the more traditional mice used for human HSC engraftment. The majority of teratomas developed so far in MISTRG contain human hematopoietic cells, and the CD34+ population isolated from over half of the teratomas contained hematopoietic colony forming cells by colony forming assay. These findings further corroborate this approach as a viable method for studying human PSC to HSC differentiation. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
