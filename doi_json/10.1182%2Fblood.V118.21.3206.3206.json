    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3206 Blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), the receptor for aldosterone (ALDO), improves cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. There is growing evidence for a critical role of ALDO in inflammation in addition to its well-described effects on sodium homeostasis. However, the role of ALDO on neutrophil activation is not entirely clear. We studied the role of ALDO on HL-60, a human promyelocytic cell line, induced to differentiate into neutrophil-like cells by incubation for 3 days with 1.3% DMSO. We detected the presence of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), the receptor for ALDO, by western blot analyses and MR transcript by quantitative RT-PCR using TaqMan detection probes in these cells. Cells incubated with ALDO (10 \u22128 -10 \u22127 M) showed a dose-dependent rise in cytosolic Ca 2+ that peaked within 3 min using FURA-2AM fluorescence; an event not observed when cells were incubated with 10 \u22128 M dexamethasone (DEXA). Consistent with these results, incubation with 10 \u22128 M ALDO led to increases in the oxidative-respiratory burst [superoxide production] ( P <0.01, n=3); an event not observed when cells were incubated with either 10 \u22128 or 10 \u22127 M dexamethasone. The oxidative responses to ALDO were blunted by pre-incubation of cells with 1 uM canrenoic acid (CA), a well-described MR antagonist ( P <0.03, n=3). We then studied the effect of ALDO on HL-60 transmigration and observed that 2 hr incubation at 37C with 10 \u22128 M ALDO led to augmented migration ( P <0.03, n=2) when compared to vehicle as estimated by CyQuant cell migration assays. We then isolated untouched circulating human neutrophils by immunomagnetic isolation following density gradient sedimentation with PolymorphPrep from otherwise healthy subjects. Flow cytometric analyses showed greater than 97% neutrophils as these cells were positive for CD45, CD16 and CD66b. Live/dead cell automated analyses shows greater than 90% cell viability by acridine orange and propidium iodide fluorescence. These cells likewise express MR as determined by western blot analyses for MR as reported in kidney and endothelial cells. Cells incubated with ALDO (10 \u22128 M) showed a rise in cytosolic Ca 2+ and an increase in the oxidative-respiratory burst ( P <0.01, n=3); a response that was sensitive to 1 uM CA. We also observed that 4 hr 10 \u22129 M ALDO incubation led to augmented neutrophil transmigration ( P <0.03, n=2). Thus our results suggest that activation of MR by ALDO leads to neutrophil activation that may contribute to the inflammatory responses associated with MR activation in vivo .
