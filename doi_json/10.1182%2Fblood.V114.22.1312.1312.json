GT results from defects of the platelet fibrinogen receptor \u03b1IIb\u03b23. GT mutations provide useful tools for structure-function relationship studies of \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Patient and methods Genomic DNA from 6 patients has been amplified for \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 promoters and exons sequences. PCR products were directly sequenced. Potential RNA processing alterations have been studied in silico by using Genscan, NNSPLICE and ESEFinder online tools. When no RNA splicing anomaly was predicted, the effect of single point mutation on \u03b1IIb\u03b23 expression has been studied by using transiently transfected Cos cells. Finally, structural consequences of amino acid substitutions has been studied using the published model of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 (code PDB 2VDL ) and structural modelling. Results 7 new mutations have been characterized. 1 deletion / insertion, 2 single point mutations inducing stop codon and 1 resulting in splicing site disruption were identified. The 3 last identified single point mutations were not predicted to affect normal RNA processing but has been shown to prevent normal expression of mutant \u03b1IIb\u03b23 at the surface of Cos cells. The p.Meth118Arg and p.Gly221Asp substitutions that induce both important steric hindrance and charge modifications, are located inside the \u03b2-I domain of \u03b23. So they should deeply alter the proper folding of the \u03b2-I domain, preventing the complex expression at the platelet surface. On the other hand, the p.Lys253Met protrudes from the \u03b2-I domain toward the \u03b1IIb \u03b2-propeller. A structural model of the Met253 \u03b2-I mutant has been done. An estimation of the direct electrostatic and desolvation free energies of interaction between the \u03b2-I domain surface and the \u03b1IIb \u03b2-propeller indicated that rather than the presence of a methionine, it is the lost of the Lys253 which is responsible for the complex expression defect. Conclusion Seven new GT mutations have been identified and the p.Lys253Met substitution helped to define a key role of the Lys253 in the \u03b1IIb \u03b2-propeller / \u03b23 \u03b2-I domains interaction.
