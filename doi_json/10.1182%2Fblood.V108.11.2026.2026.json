    "abstract_text": "Background: Isolated brain parenchyma relapse as initial site of relapse is a rare complication of NHL and carries a poor prognosis. Few large series focus on treatment characteristics and outcomes of isolated brain parenchyma relapse of NHL. Methods: The IPCG conducted a retrospective review of patient and treatment characteristics and outcomes of this complication. Following initial diagnosis and treatment of NHL (1980\u20132004), cases with brain parenchyma relapse as initial relapse site, with no evidence of lymphoma elsewhere in the body at the time of brain relapse, were eligible. Cases with brain, spine or leptomeningeal involvement at NHL diagnosis were not eligible. Results: 113 cases were assembled from 13 investigators in 8 countries. Preliminary data summaries are: 94 (83%) cases had diffuse large B-cell NHL, 5 (4%) follicular lymphoma, 3 (3%) Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, other NHL subtypes (11) . Median age at NHL diagnosis was 61yrs (16\u201385 yrs). 55% were male. Median ECOG at NHL diagnosis was 1. Median time from NHL diagnosis to isolated brain relapse was 1.8 yrs (3 months\u201315.9 yrs). 76 (67%) relapsed in brain less than 3 yrs after NHL diagnosis. Symptoms at brain relapse included mental status changes in 37%, gait/balance disturbance (27%), motor/sensory symptoms (23%). Median ECOG at brain relapse was 2. Parenchyma relapse was documented by brain imaging plus biopsy in 54 (48%), or imaging without biopsy in 58 (52%); not reported (1). 53 (48%) cases had one brain lesion; 56 (50%) had two or more lesions; not reported (4). Site of relapse was cerebral hemispheres in 53 (48%) cases, deep brain structures (brain stem/cerebellum) in 30 (27%), cerebral hemispheres and deep brain structures in 23 (21%); not reported (7). At brain relapse, CSF was positive in 11 (10%) cases, negative in 56 (50%); not reported (46[40%]). Treatment for brain relapse was chemotherapy alone in 52 (46%) cases, WBRT alone in 34 (30%), chemotherapy followed by RT in 26 (23%), and brain surgery alone (1). 78 (69%) cases are deceased. Median survival from brain parenchyma relapse to death was 1.6 yrs (95% CI: 11 months\u20132.6 yrs). Effect of treatment type at brain relapse on survival, will be reported. Brain lymphoma was the cause of death in 49 (63%) cases; CNS toxicity was the cause in 6 (8%) cases. Conclusion: Though a rare relapse site, prospective studies are needed to improve understanding and outcomes of isolated brain parenchyma relapse of NHL."
