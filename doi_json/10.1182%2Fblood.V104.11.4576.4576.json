    "abstract_text": "ABVD is widely considered as the gold standard treatment for advanced Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (HL), although about 40% of patients relapse or do not respond to initial treatment. Recently, the HD9 trial of the German Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma Study Group has shown that escalated (esc) BEACOPP regimen can achieve better disease control than ABVD, but has a high incidence of acute and long-term toxicities including high occurrence of AML/MDS. In an attempt to decrease toxicity while preserving the potential benefit of upfront intensive therapy, we conducted a pilot study, which tested the feasibility, toxicity and efficacy of combined escBEACOPP-ABVD regimen as therapy for newly diagnosed patients with high risk (IPS\u22653) stage III\u2013IV HL. Patients initially received 2 cycles of escBEACOPP followed by reevaluation with CT and gallium or PET/CT-FDG scans. When complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) was achieved, patients continued to receive 4 cycles of ABVD, while those failing to achieve a response were withdrawn from the study. Since August 2001, 21 patients entered the study and at the time of present analysis four of them are still receiving therapy. Three (18%) of 17 patients, who completed chemotherapy, received consolidative radiotherapy. Median age at diagnosis was 26 years (range 18\u201356) and 11 (57%) were males. Stage IV and B symptoms were evidenced in 19 (90%) and 17 (81%), respectively, and 7 (33%) had bulky mediastinal mass. Histology included nodular sclerosis in 18 patients (86%), mixed cellularity in 2 (10%) and lymphocyte predominance in 1 (5%). Following the first 2 cycles of escBEACOPP the overall response rate (CR+PR) was 100%. At the end of all therapy 15 patients (88%) were in CR, one patient in PR and only a single patient had progressive disease. With a median follow-up of 20 months no patient relapsed or died. Toxicity included WHO grade III\u2013IV granulocytopenia in 15 patients (88%) and grade III\u2013IV infection in one patient. Hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics was necessary in 10 patients (59%). Almost all of these events occurred during the first two cycles of escBEACOPP, while acute toxicity during the ABVD phase was mild. In conclusion, the combined escBEACOPP-ABVD regimen is well tolerated and is associated with a high CR rate when used in advanced HL patients with high IPS scores. Further follow-up is obviously required in order to determine long-term survival and late complications of this regimen.",
