    "abstract_text": "SNS-595 is a novel, cell cycle active cytotoxic naphthyridine analog that induces G2 arrest in a variety of preclinical tumor models. We initiated an escalating-dose phase 1 trial of SNS-595, administered as a weekly x 3 (arm A) or twice weekly x 2 bolus (arm B), in patients with advanced or refractory acute leukemias. Objectives: The primary objectives were to: establish safety, tolerability, and MTD of SNS-595 given on each schedule, characterize pharmacokinetics (PK) of SNS-595 when given on these schedules. Secondary objectives were: assessment of clinical activity, exploration of potential biomarkers. Methods: SNS-595 was administered as a slow IV push on days 1, 8, 15 (arm A) or days 1, 4, 8, 11 (arm B). Minimum cycle length was 42 days (arm A) and 39 days (arm B). Additional cycles were permitted if patients achieved stable disease or better. The starting dose was 18 mg/m 2 /d on arm A, and 9 mg/m 2 /d on arm B and escalated by cohort using a modified Fibonacci schema. PK analyses for SNS-595 were performed on plasma samples collected during cycle 1. Pretreatment peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate samples were collected for exploratory analyses of the level and functional activity of the DNA damage repair proteins DNA-PK and MSH2. Results: To date, 21 patients have been enrolled and are evaluable in the live database, including 13 patients assigned to arm A and 8 assigned to arm B, 12 males and 9 females with a median age of 64 years. Diagnoses included AML (19 patients) and ALL (2 patients). All patients had disease refractory to or relapsed from prior therapy (median 3 prior regimens (range 1\u20136)). Dose escalation has proceeded to 50 mg/m 2 /d (arm A) and 19 mg/m 2 /d (arm B). No dose-limiting toxicities have been observed to date. Non-dose limiting toxicities included nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis . Grade 4 neutropenic fever was observed in only one patient. Plasma exposures at the first two dose levels in each arm increased linearly, resulting in AUCs of 5.5 \u2013 17.8 ughr/mL for 9\u201327 mg/m 2 doses. CL, Vss, and terminal half-lives were similar to those reported previously in solid tumor patients, and averaged ~2 L/hr/m 2 , 58 L/m 2 , and 23 hr, respectively. No patients have achieved complete response to date, although 6 patients (distributed across all dosing groups) experienced >50% reductions in peripheral blasts following cycle 1. Conclusion: SNS-595 appears to be well-tolerated in patients with advanced leukemias, with preliminary and promising signs of clinical activity as measured by decreases in leukemic blasts. Bone marrow ablation has not yet been achieved; patient accrual and dose-escalation are ongoing.",
