    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2842 IGHV gene mutational load and use of specific IGHV genes and stereotypes have all been reported to have prognostic significance in CLL. In the UK CLL4 trial there were significant differences in response rate and progression free survival regardless of whether a 97% or 98% cut off was used, and the percentage of mutations which correlates best with clinical outcome remains controversial. We performed IGHV gene sequencing on 1071 patients with CLL or \u2018clinical\u2019 MBL (n= 153) in whom biomarkers, time to first treatment (TTFT) and overall survival (OS) were available. Four hundred and ninety six cases were entered into the UK CLL4 trial and 575 presented or were referred to the Royal Bournemouth Hospital. TTFT and OS were determined for cases with 97% identity (TTFT -13.1 months p=0.052 and OS-84.5 months p=0.177). When TTFT was determined for patients with early stage disease only (stage A CLL or CLL-like MBL, n=571), those with 97% identity, determined using either leader sequence or BIOMED 2 primers, had a significantly longer median TTFT than those with >97% identity (92.0 and 36.4 months respectively; p=0.012) and significantly shorter than those cases with 97% identity (TTFT; 68 vs. 26 months p=0.034). However, when compared to cases with <97% identity, there was a trend towards a shorter TTFT but significance was not reached (68 vs. 128 months p=0.060). A series of Cox Regression analyses were conducted to see if the prognostic value of the 98% cut off in MBL/stage A cases could be improved. In univariate analyses a model which incorporated 97% identity and stereotype subset 2 was the best discriminator of TTFT (p=0.0011) ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1.

Further analyses were performed to investigate whether the differences in TTFT between cases with 97% identity could be explained by differences in IGHV gene usage. Sixty-one percent of cases with 97% identity to germline utilised only five genes; IGHV3-21, IGHV3-23, IGHV3-48, IGHV3-53 and IGHV1-18 and these genes were significantly over-represented in cases with 97% compared to either, cases with 0.001) or >97% (p>0.001). When subset 2 cases were excluded, there was no difference in TTFT between cases using the above 5 genes and all other IGHV genes at this identity (p=0.288). In contrast to previously published data we found no difference in TTFT between mutated IGHV3-23 cases and other mutated cases (using a 98% cut-off), but IGHV3-23 cases with 97% identity had a shorter TTFT than cases with <97% identity (p<0.001). In conclusion the clinical course of cases with 97% identity, especially if diagnosed early in their disease, appears distinct from other cases defined as having mutated IGHV genes using the conventional 98% cut off. This is not accounted for by differences in IGHV gene usage, the incidence of stereotypy or other biomarkers and may reflect differences in response to BCR stimulation between cases with 97% and <97% identity.
