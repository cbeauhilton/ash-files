    "abstract_text": "Background/Aim: Hepcidin, a hepatic antimicrobial protein, is usually over-expressed in iron deficiency anemia. However, whether gastric Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) infection effects a change in hepcidin level in iron deficiency anemia is still uncertain. We evaluated whether H. pylori eradication decreased hepcidin level and increased hemoglobin and ferritin levels in iron deficiency anemia. Method: From October 2006 to April 2007, nine females (mean age of 32.2 year-old) who were diagnosed as iron deficiency anemia without definite blood loss, were included in the study. All the subjects underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy to diagnose gastric H. pylori infection and to exclude any source of gastrointestinal bleeding. Blood samplings for hemoglobin, hematocrit, iron (Fe), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), ferritin and hepcidin tests were taken just before H. pylori eradication and four weeks after H. pylori eradication and oral iron supplement therapy, respectively. Serum prohepcidin level was measured by Hepcidin Prohormone ELISA (Solid Phase Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) kits. Statistical analysis was done by Wilcoxon signed rank test. Result: H. pylori eradication was successful in all the subjects who revealed negative in urea breath test. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, Fe, TIBC and ferritin levels improved in all the subjects after H. pylori eradication (Table 1). Mean serum hepcidin level was 224.8 \u00b1 23.2 ng/ml initially, but decreased to 179.7 \u00b1 40.8 ng/ml after H. pylori eradication therapy ( p = 0.015). Conclusion: Our result provides evidence that hepcidin level decreases after successful H. pylori eradication with the improvement of iron deficiency anemia. A fall in serum hepcidin level resulting from successful H. pylori eradication reflects that hepcidin is an important mediator of iron absorption in iron deficiency anemia associated with gastric H. pylori infection.
