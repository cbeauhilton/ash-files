    "abstract_text": "Background Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation post- allogeneic transplant increases mortality(1). Very few studies have explored the significance of pre-engraftment CMV reactivation on subsequent CMV-related outcomes or therapy. Aim To determine the incidence and outcome of pre-engraftment CMV reactivation. Methods All consecutive patients transplanted May 2015-Jan 2019 at the Royal Melbourne Hospital were included in this observational retrospective study. Plasma CMV DNA load was monitored by real-time PCR assays twice per week. Pre-emptive CMV treatment was commenced when the CMV viral load was greater than 400 IU/ml. Risk factors for pre-engraftment CMV were assessed by univariate logistic regression analysis. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare post-transplant CMV reactivation and time of treatment initiation; the Fisher's exact test was used for CMV disease and acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD); neutrophil engraftment, relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared using the Log-Rank Method. Results Of the 220 patients, 182 patients had CMV reactivation and pre-engraftment CMV levels available. Of these 182, 102 (56%) had CMV detected on at least one occasion before engraftment (D-10 to D+30). No pre-transplant factors including conditioning type and CMV serostatus were found to be associated with the development of pre-engraftment CMV reactivation. Patients who had pre-engraftment viraemia patients had a shorter time to post-transplant CMV detection (p<0.0001; Y=27.2d vs N=36.3d). These patients also had a longer time to neutrophil engraftment (p=0.049, median 19d vs 18d). Despite the shorter time to detection, there was no difference in likelihood of commencement of pre-emptive anti CMV therapy (p=0.88), day of CMV therapy commencement (p=0.29) and the total length of treatment (p=0.82). Patients with pre-engraftment viraemia were not at an increased risk of CMV disease (P=0.65) or aGVHD (p=0.87). There was no difference in RFS (p=0.99) or OS (p=0.14). Conclusion These results suggest that pre-transplant CMV detection should not affect the decision to proceed to transplant or require earlier initiation of prophylactic or pre-emptive therapy.
