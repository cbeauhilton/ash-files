    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2431 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a clinically heterogeneous disease. A very reliable prognosticator is the mutational status of the tumor immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV): patients with unmutated (UM) IGHV have a worse prognosis than patients with mutated (M) IGHV. Soluble factors (i.e. IL-4 and CD40L) and cellular components of the local microenvironment [i.e. bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and nurse-like cells (NLCs)] are important survival factors for CLL B cells. It is currently unknown to what extent UM and M CLL cells depend on the local microenvironment for their survival. We have evaluated the spontaneous apoptotic rate of tumor cells isolated by immunomagnetic selection from the peripheral blood (PB) of M and UM CLL patients. Both M and UM CLL B cells underwent spontaneous apoptosis throughout the culture period. However, the UM CLL B cells showed a significantly higher degree of apoptosis in 7-day cultures as compared to M CLL B cells. In both M and UM CLL B cells, high basal levels of Bcl-2 expression and NF-kB activity were detected. On day 7, the percentage of Bcl-2 + leukemic cells was significantly lower in UM than in M CLL B cells. EMSA test showed that NF-kB was totally inactivated in UM CLL B cells and only partially reduced in M CLL B cells. Quantitative analysis of RelA and RelB subunits showed that NF-kB inactivation in UM CLL B cells consisted in a strong reduction of both RelA and RelB nuclear expression. CD40L, IL-4 and stromal cells significantly improved UM CLL B cells viability and significantly recovered Bcl-2 expression. The protective effect exerted by these stimuli was totally independent from the recovery of NF-kB expression. Indeed, after 7 days of culture, the UM CLL B cells had completely lost the nuclear form of NF-kB, and none of the stimuli was capable of restoring it. We observed that UM CLL cells were less susceptible to spontaneous apoptosis when cultured as unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (M or UM PBMC) as compared to purified leukemic cells (M and UM CLL B cells). The reduced apoptosis detected in UM PBMC was accompanied by a retained expression of Bcl-2 and by a restored activity of NF-kB and suggested the presence of a pro-survival element in the peripheral blood of these patients. To investigate the role of NLC in rescuing UM CLL B cells from apoptosis we first evaluated whether M and UM PBMC generated NLC with the same efficiency. Unexpectedly, the former generated significantly higher numbers of NLC than UM PBMC. Despite the lack of generation of NLC, CLL B cells viability was very similar in the non-adherent fraction of M and UM PBMC on day 7 and 14 of culture. This observation ruled out a role for NLC in supporting UM CLL B cells survival. Conversely, a pro-survival effect on UM CLL B cells was exerted by autologous T cells. Indeed, a significant reduction in the apoptotic rate of leukemic cells was observed when purified UM CLL B cells were cultured in the presence of autologous peripheral blood T cells (UM CLL B cell/T cell co-cultures). NF-kB activity was completely lost in UM CLL B cells cultured for 7 days in medium alone whereas it was restored in UM CLL B cells / T cells co-cultures. The prosurvival effect of circulating T cells was exerted both in cell-to-cell contact and in trans-well condition and was associated to increased secretions of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB and interleukin-8 (IL-8) as detected by analyses of supernatants through a Multiplex system. These data indicate that despite their more aggressive features, UM CLL B cells are more susceptible to spontaneous apoptosis and depend from environmental prosurvival signals. This vulnerability of UM CLL B cells can be exploited as a selective target of therapeutic interventions.
