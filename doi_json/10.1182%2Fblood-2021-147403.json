    "abstract_text": "Background: ZUMA-1 is the registrational Phase 1/2 study of axi-cel, an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, in pts with refractory LBCL. In ZUMA-1 Cohorts 1+2 (C1+2; N=101), rates of Grade (Gr) \u22653 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events (NEs) were 13% and 28%, respectively, at the 6-mo primary analysis; the objective response rate (ORR) was 82% (54% complete response [CR]; Neelapu et al. NEJM. 2017). ZUMA-1 safety management C6 assessed whether prophylactic and earlier corticosteroids and/or tocilizumab could reduce incidence and severity of CRS and NEs. With a median follow-up of 8.9 mo (N=40) for C6, there were no Gr \u22653 CRS, a low rate of Gr \u22653 NEs (13%), and high response rates (Oluwole et al. BJH. 2021). Here, we present a 1-yr updated analysis of C6 supported by propensity score matching (PSM) analysis to compare outcomes for pts in C6 vs C1+2. Methods: Eligible pts could receive optional bridging therapy after leukapheresis. Pts received conditioning chemotherapy for 3 d prior to a single axi-cel infusion. Pts received once-daily oral dexamethasone 10 mg on Days 0 (before axi-cel), 1, and 2; corticosteroids and/or tocilizumab for adverse event (AE) management were given earlier vs C1+2. The primary endpoints were incidence and severity of CRS and NEs. Other endpoints included efficacy outcomes and biomarker analyses. To ensure comparability for pts in C6 and C1+2, an exploratory PSM analysis was performed after balancing for key baseline disease characteristics (tumor burden, IPI score, no. of prior lines of chemotherapy, disease stage, and LDH level). Results: As of December 16, 2020, the median follow-up time was 14.9 mo. Gr \u22653 AEs were reported in all 40 treated pts, and the most common were neutropenia (45%), neutrophil count decreased (33%), and white blood cell count decreased (23%). No Gr \u22653 CRS occurred. Gr \u22653 NEs were reported in 15% of pts. Median time to CRS and NE onset was 5 and 6 d, respectively, after axi-cel infusion. Infections of any grade occurred in 50% of pts (20% Gr \u22653). Since the 6-mo analysis, no new cases of CRS were observed. Four new axi-cel-related NEs occurred in 2 pts (pt 1: Gr 2 mental status changes and seizure-like phenomena both on Day 441; pt 2: Gr 1 dementia [occurred on Day 93 but was reported late] and Gr 5 toxic encephalopathy on Day 369 [resultant from a Gr 4 event that started on Day 351]). Two new infections of Gr 2 pneumonia and Gr 1 bronchitis were observed; the latter was axi-cel-related. One death due to progressive disease occurred. The investigator-assessed ORR was 95% (80% CR). Median DOR, PFS, and OS were not reached. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 12-mo DOR, PFS, and OS rates were 60%, 63%, and 82%, respectively. At data cutoff, 53% of pts were in ongoing response. Median peak CAR T-cell levels were comparably high in pts with ongoing response and relapse (64 cells/\u00b5L [n=21] and 66 cells/\u00b5L [n=15], respectively) at 12 mo and considerably lower in nonresponders (18 cells/\u00b5L [n=2]). In all, 32 matched pts each in C6 and C1+2 were identified during PSM analysis; 8 pts from C6 were not included due to nonavailability of matched pts in C1+2. No Gr \u22653 CRS was observed in C6 vs 13% of pts in C1+2. Incidence of Gr \u22653 NEs was comparable in C6 and C1+2 (19% and 22%, respectively), with median time to onset of 12 d in C6 vs 7 d in C1+2. The ORR was 94% in both C6 and matched C1+2 (75% and 78% CR rates, respectively); 47% and 59% of pts were in ongoing response at 12 mo. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the 12-mo PFS rate was 61% in both C6 and matched C1+2. Median peak CAR T-cell levels were 65 and 43 cells/\u00b5L, respectively, in C6 and C1+2. Serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers associated with CAR T-cell treatment-related AEs (IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, GM-CSF, and ferritin) were lower in C6 vs C1+2. Median cumulative corticosteroid dose including prophylaxis was 1252 mg in C6 (n=32) and 7418 mg in C1+2 (n=6). Conclusion: With \u22651-y follow-up, prophylactic and earlier corticosteroid and/or tocilizumab intervention continued to demonstrate a manageable safety profile, absence of new safety signals, and high, durable response rates, which was corroborated by PSM analysis. Although fewer pts in C1+2 received corticosteroids after matching, the median cumulative corticosteroid dose was 4-fold lower in C6 vs C1+2. These findings suggest that the C6 AE management strategy can improve long-term safety of axi-cel in R/R LBCL without compromising durability of responses.
