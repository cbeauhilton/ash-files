Disruption of the Hoxa9 gene in mice leads to defects in erythroid, lymphoid and myeloid hematopoiesis while over-expression of Hoxa9 leads to leukemia in mice. Transcription of Hoxa9 is partly regulated by the Mixed lineage leukemia gene ( Mll ) product. Bone marrow cells of mice carrying the leukemic Mll-AF9 fusion gene as a knock-in mutation (henceforth called Mll ), display an increase in expression of several Hox genes - Hoxa5 , Hoxa6 , Hoxa7 , Hoxa9 and Hoxa10 , when compared to age matched wild type mice (Kumar et. al, 2004, Blood ). Since the over-expressed Hox genes all belong to the same Hox-a cluster, we hypothesized that these genes might be co-regulated during normal hematopoiesis. Co-regulation of neighboring genes within the same cluster has been reported by others for the Hox-b and c clusters. To test this hypothesis for the 5\u2032 Hox-a cluster genes, we compared expression levels of Hoxa5 , Hox7 and Hoxa10 in Hoxa9 homozygous knockout ( Hoxa9 \u2212/\u2212 ) and wild type bone marrow by real-time quantitative RT-PCR using Taqman primers/probe sets (Applied Biosystems, CA). Expression levels of Hoxa5 , Hoxa7 , and Hoxa10 were all reduced by 65% \u00b1 2% in Hoxa9 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to wild type mice. In contrast, levels of Hoxb4 and Meis1 - homeobox genes that are not part of the Hox-a cluster - were identical in Hoxa9 \u2212/\u2212 and wild type mice. These results show no compensatory increases in expression of other 5\u2032 Hox-a genes in the absence of Hoxa9 , but instead demonstrate that disruption of Hoxa9 decreases the expression of neighboring genes in the Hox-a cluster. The hematopoietic defects seen in Hoxa9 \u2212/\u2212 mice (leucopenia, lymphopenia and blunted granulocytic response to G-CSF) might thus be attributable to the deficiency of multiple Hox-a gene products, rather than of Hoxa9 alone. To further evaluate the extent of this co-regulation, we studied the expression levels of these genes in Mll mice that lacked Hoxa9 ( Hoxa9 \u2212/\u2212 /Mll-AF9 +/\u2212 , henceforth called Mll/Hox ). The Mll/Hox mice develop leukemia at the same rate and time course as the Mll mice, but with a phenotype that is relatively more immature. In Mll/Hox mice, the expression levels of Hoxa5 and Hoxa7 were increased 13 fold and 4 fold respectively, while those of Hoxa10 remained decreased at 35% of wild type. These results indicate that the decreased expression of neighboring Hox-a genes in Hoxa9 \u2212/\u2212 mice was reversed by Mll-AF9 for Hoxa5 and Hoxa7 , but not for Hoxa10 , suggesting a second level of co-regulation for Hoxa9 and Hoxa10 . Overall, our findings demonstrate a co-regulated relationship between the 5\u2032 Hox-a cluster genes during normal hematopoiesis, and provide evidence that deregulation of a single Hoxa9 gene significantly alters the expression of neighboring Hox-a cluster genes with implications for understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms of leukemia.",
