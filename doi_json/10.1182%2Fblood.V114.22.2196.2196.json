The European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations were designed to help identify ECP CML patients responding poorly to front-line IM, suggesting, at given time points, when the treatment strategy should be changed (\u201dfailure\u201d), or when \u201cthe long-term outcome of the treatment would not likely be as favourable\u201d (\u201csuboptimal response\u201d). Suboptimal response is a \u201cgrey zone\u201d: the patient may still have substantial benefit from continuing IM, but other therapies should be considered. AIM: To assess the outcome of \u201cfailure\u201d and \u201csuboptimal responders\u201d Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) CML patients in a large multicentric, nationwide experience. METHODS: Between January 2004 and April 2007, 559 patients were enrolled in an observational study and in 2 independent intervention studies of the GIMEMA CML WP (Clin Trials Gov. NCT00514488 and NCT00510926 ). Response monitoring was based on conventional cytogenetic examination of bone marrow cell metaphases every 6 months and RT Q-PCR evaluations of blood cells after 3, 6, 12 months, and every 6 months thereafter. Definitions: major molecular response (MMR): BCR-ABL/ABL ratio < 0,1% IS ; failure (according to ELN criteria): no hematologic response (HR) at 3 months, no complete HR (CHR) at 6 months, no cytogenetic response (CgR) at 6 months, no partial CgR (PCgR) at 1 year, no complete CgR (CCgR) at 18 months, loss CHR or CCgR, progression or death; suboptimal response (according to ELN criteria): no CHR at 3 months, no PCgR at 6 months, no CCgR at 12 months, no MMR at 18 months ; optimal response: non-suboptimal and non-failure at each time-point; event: failure or treatment discontinuation for any reason. All the calculations have been made according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: The patients who fitted the ELN criteria for failure had a significantly lower probability of subsequently achieving a CCgR and a MMR, and had a significantly lower overall survival (OS), failure-free survival (FFS) and event-free survival (EFS). The patients who fitted the ELN definitions of suboptimal response at 6 months (data not shown) and at 12 months ( figure 1 ) had a significantly lower probability than \u201coptimal\u201d responders of subsequently achieving a CCgR and a MMR, and a significantly poorer FFS and EFS ( figure 1 ), while the OS was not different in the two groups (90% and 95%, p= 0.35). CONCLUSIONS Our data confirms that suboptimal responders at 6 and at 12 months have a poorer outcome with respect to \u201coptimal\u201d responders, comparable to the outcome of failure patients.
