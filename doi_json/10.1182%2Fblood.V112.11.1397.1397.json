    "abstract_text": "TGF-\u03b21 is a cytokine with pleiotropic effects. It has been considered that TGF-\u03b21plays a major role on hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) based on in vitro experiment. Achieving in vivo experiments proved to be difficult because constitutive TGF-\u03b21 knock-out (KO) in mice leads to lethality during the first 4 weeks of life from a wasting syndrome related to tissue infiltration by activated T cells and macrophages. For this reason, hematopoiesis of TGF-\u03b21\u2212/\u2212 mice has not been studied in details. In contrast the role of TGF-\u03b21 has been recently extensively studied in conditional TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor (T\u03b2RI) KO mice. No clear effect was observed on HSC functions, suggesting that TGF-\u03b21 was not a key physiological regulator of hematopoiesis in the adult. However, these experiments have some limitations. They do not exclude a putative role for TGF-\u03b21 during fetal hematopoiesis and they do not specifically address the role of TGF-\u03b21 on hematopoiesis because KO of TGF-\u03b2 receptor leads to signaling arrest for all TGF-\u03b2s. In addition, other receptors may be involved in TGF-\u03b21 signaling. For these reasons, we have investigated the hematopoiesis of constitutive TGF-\u03b21 KO mice with a mixed Sv129 \u00d7 CF-1 genetic background allowing the birth of a high proportion of homozygotes. In 2 week-old neonate mice, we have shown a decrease of bone marrow (BM) and spleen progenitors and a decrease of immature progenitors colony forming unit of the spleen (CFU-s). Moreover this was associated with a loss in reconstitutive activity of TGF-\u03b21\u2212/\u2212 HSC from BM. However, although asymptomatic, these mice had an excess of activated lymphocytes and an augmentation of Sca-1 antigen on hematopoietic cells suggesting an excess of \u03b3-interferon release. Thus we studied hematopoiesis of 7 to 10 days-old neonate mice, before phenotypic modification and inflammatory cytokine release. Similar results were observed with a decrease in the number of progenitors and in the proliferation of TGF-\u03b21\u2212/\u2212 BM cells along with an increased differentiation but without an augmentation in apoptosis. Moreoever, a loss of long term reconstitutive capacity of BM Lineage negative (Lin\u2212) TGF-\u03b21\u2212/\u2212 cells along with a diminution of homing of TGF-\u03b21\u2212/\u2212 progenitors was found. These results demonstrate that TGF-\u03b21 may play a major role on the HSC/Progenitor compartment in vivo and that this defect does not seem to be linked to the immune disease. To completely overpass the risk of the inflammatory syndrome, we analyzed hematopoiesis of fetal liver (FL) of TGF-\u03b21\u2212/\u2212 mice and still found a decrease in progenitors, a profound defect in the proliferative capacities, in long term reconstitutive activity and homing potential of primitive FL hematopoietic cells. Our results demonstrate that TGF-\u03b21 plays an important role during hematopoietic embryonic development. Altogether these findings suggest that TGF-\u03b21 is a potent positive regulator for the in vivo homeostasis of the HSC compartment."
