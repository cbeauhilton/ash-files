    "abstract_text": "Background : FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A R882 mutations are both independent factors for poor prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has been confirmed to improve the outcome of AML with either of gene mutations. However, the clinical characteristics of AML with both of FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A R882 mutations and their outcome post allo-HSCT had been rarely evaluated. Objective : To investigate the clinical characteristics and transplantation outcomes of AML patients with the double mutations. Methods: A total of 241 patients were included in this retrospective analysis. Molecular genetic mutation sets in bone marrow (including FLT3-ITD, DNMT3A, C-kit, CEBPA, FLT3-TKD , and NMP1 ) of 241 AML patients were detected at diagnosis using direct sequencing method. And the clinical data of these patients were analyzed retrospectively. Results: (1)According to the genetic mutation types, the 241 AML patients were divided into four groups: FLT3-ITD+DNMT3A R882+, FLT3-ITD+DNMT3A R882-, FLT3-ITD-DNMT3A R882+ and FLT3-ITD-DNMT3A R882- groups, which consisted of 19, 38, 21 and 163 patients, respectively. (2) Patients with FLT3-ITD+DNMT3A R882+ have high white blood cell count and a low complete remission rate after first induction chemotherapy (52.6%), which are common in M5\u3001M2\u3001M4 with normal chromosome karyotype, higher early cumulative incidence of relapse(6m-CIR 36.8\u00b11.3%\u300112m-CIR 49.7\u00b11.6%) and cumulative mortality rate (6m-CMR 26.3\u00b110.1%\u300112m-CMR 48.5\u00b111.8%) . (3) 2-year CIR of the FLT3-ITD+DNMT3A R882+ was (72.2\u00b12.7%), which was significantly higher than that of the FLT3-ITD+DNMT3A R882- group (38.6\u00b10.7%) and FLT3-ITD-DNMT3A R882+ group (36.8\u00b11.6%). While the 2-year overall survival (OS) rate and 2-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) rate of double mutation group were (30.9\u00b113.3% ) and (11.3\u00b110.2%), respectively, which were considerably lower than those of the FLT3-ITD+DNMT3A R882- and FLT3-ITD-DNMT3A R882+ groups (2y-OS: 67.5\u00b17.8%, 61.4\u00b112.4%: 2y-LFS: 47.9\u00b18.4%, 56.8\u00b112.5%). Meanwhile, the 2-year CIR rates of the FLT3-ITD+DNMT3A R882- and FLT3-ITD-DNMT3A R882+ groups were significantly higher than that of the FLT3-ITD-DNMT3A R882- group (16.3\u00b10.1%), while their 2-year OS rate and 2-year LFS rate were significantly lower than those of the FLT3-ITD-DNMT3A R882- group (2y-OS: 82.5\u00b13.1%\u30012y-LFS: 80.9\u00b13.2%). (3) Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that disease status prior to transplantation, grade III-IV aGVHD, FLT3-ITD, DNMT3A R882 and FLT3-ITD+DNMT3A R882+ were independent factors for poor prognosis post transplantation. Conclusion: AML patients with FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A R882 double mutations still present a very poor prognosis after transplantation with low OS and LFSas well as a high CIR rate. Therefore, it is necessary to explore prevention strategy for relapse post transplantation. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
