    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Natural Killer (NK) cells play a key role in defense against tumor cells that have the capacity to downregulate Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I expression. It has been reported that leukemic cells can have down-regulated expression of HLA class I molecules. Apparently, the NK cells of these patients are not able to destroy these leukemic cells and may allow malignant cells to escape from innate immune control. This failure may be due to the fact that NK cells are part of the malignant clone and therefore might have a decreased function. An alternative hypothesis could be that these patients may display a NK cell Receptor (NKR) genotype incapable of destroying leukemic cells with aberrant expression of HLA class I molecules. The polymorphic nature of the NKR genes generates diverse repertoires in the human population, which display specificity in the innate immune response. Materials and Methods: In the present study, 11 Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor (KIRs) and 2 CD94/NKG2 receptors were genotyped by PCR-SSP in 96 leukemic patients and 148 healthy Caucasians. Results and Conclusion: We report a significant increased frequency of the more inhibitory AB KIR phenotype in leukemic patients compared to the controls (31.1% in healthy controls vs. 51.0% in leukemic patients, P c = 0.002), which is related to the high prevalence of the inhibitory KIR2DL2 in this population ( P c = 0.007). Moreover, two specific KIR phenotypes AB1 and AB9, including all inhibitory KIRs, were significantly associated with leukemic patients. Our study suggests that an important percentage of leukemic patients express a KIR phenotype in favor of escape from NK cell immunity."
