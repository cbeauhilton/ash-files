    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4469 The BCR-ABL1 translocation occurs in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and in 25% of cases with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We screened a panel of BCR-ABL1 positive cell lines to find models for imatinib-resistance studies. Five of 19 BCR-ABL1 positive cell lines were resistant to imatinib-induced apoptosis (KCL-22, MHH-TALL1, NALM-1, SD-1, SUP-B15). None of the five resistant cell lines carried mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 and \u2013 consequently \u2013 all also showed resistance to the second generation kinase inhibitors, nilotinib or dasatinib. All Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive cell lines demonstrated constitutive phosphorylation of STAT5 and S6. Imatinib induced dephosphorylation of both BCR-ABL1 downstream effectors in responsive cell lines, but - remarkably \u2013 induced dephosphorylation of STAT5 in resistant cell lines as well. By administering well-described signalling pathway inhibitors we were able to show that activation of mTOR complex 1 was responsible for the constitutive S6 phosphorylation of imatinib-resistant cells. Neither BCR-ABL1 nor Src kinases or Ras/Rac-GTPases underlie tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in these cell lines. In conclusion, none of the five TKI-resistant cell lines showed aberrant activation of previously-described oncogenic pathways which would explain their resistance. These findings raise the question whether these cell lines might help to find a novel \u2013 alternative \u2013 explanation for TKI resistance. Interestingly, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib induced apoptosis in TKI-resistant and \u2013sensitive Ph+ cell lines. Bortezomib is being used for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Our findings support the notion that bortezomib might also be useful for the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
