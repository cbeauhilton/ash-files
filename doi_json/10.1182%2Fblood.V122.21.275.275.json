    "abstract_text": "Background Glycosylation is a stepwise procedure of covalent attachment of oligosaccharide chains to proteins or lipids, and alterations in this process, especially increased sialylation, have been associated with malignant transformation and metastasis. The adhesion and trafficking of multiple myeloma (MM) cells is strongly influenced by glycosylation and multiple myeloma cells express a variety of adhesion molecules, including selectin ligands and integrins, which are typically dependent on glycosylation for their function. We have previously reported that the sialyltransferase ST3GAL6 is up-regulated in plasma cells from MM patients and that increased expression is associated with inferior overall survival (OS) in MM gene expression profiling (GEP) datasets. The functional significance of increased sialylation of MM cells has not previously been reported. Methods MM cell lines MM1s and RPMI-8226 were confirmed to have high expression levels of ST3GAL6 at the gene and protein level compared to healthy controls. Knockdown of ST3GAL6 was confirmed in MM cell lines RPMI-8226 and MM1s using lentiviral shRNAs targeting different regions in the ST3GAL6 mRNA. Specific ST3GAL6 knockdown was confirmed by reduced ST3GAL6 mRNA and protein expression in comparison to a scrambled control. In a calcein-AM fluorescence based adhesion assay we next evaluated the effects of ST3GAL6 knockdown on MM-cell adhesion to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC\u2019s) and fibronectin coated plates. Migration to 30nM SDF1-\u03b1 was assessed using transwell plates comparing ST3GAL6 knockdown cells to scrambled controls. The commercially available sialyltransferase inhibitor 3Fax-Neu5Ac was used to pre-treat MM cells in vitro prior to assessment of apoptosis by flow cytometry. shST3GAL6 MM1s cells positive for green fluorescent protein and luciferin (GFP-Luc+) were injected into tail veins of SCID-Bg mice (5x10 6 cells, n=5/group) and mice were followed weekly using bioluminescent imaging (BLI) for tumor development. Bone marrow homing of tumor cells was assessed using in vivo confocal imaging of the skull vasculature (n=3/group). Results Knockdown of ST3GAL6 in MM cell lines resulted in a 50% reduction in cell surface staining with the monoclonal antibody HECA-452. This indicated reduced expression of cutaneous lymphocyte associated antigen (CLA), a carbohydrate domain shared by sialyl Lewis X (sLex) and sialyl Lewis a (sLea) antigens, confirming suppression of ST3GAL6 activity. There was a significant reduction in the ability of knockdown cells to adhere to BMSC\u2019s and fibronectin in-vitro compared to scrambled controls (P=0.016, 0.032 respectively). Migration ability of these cells in response to SDF1-\u03b1 was also reduced (P=0.01). In vivo in a xenograft SCID-Bg mouse model shST3GAL6 cells demonstrated a reduced tumor burden as assessed by weekly BLI (P=0.017 at week 4). A consolidated map of the skull bone marrow niche in mice injected with shST3GAL6 MM1s GFP-Luc+ cells revealed a reduced homing ability of these cells in comparison to mice injected with scrambled control cells. Treatment of the MM cell lines MM1s and RPMI-8226 with a sialyltransferase inhibitor 3Fax-Neu5Ac resulted in almost complete elimination of cell surface sLex and/or sLea expression as determined by HECA-452 staining. Following pre-treatment with 3Fax-Neu5Ac, MM1S cells grown in co-culture with BMSC\u2019s cells showed increased sensitivity to Bortezomib compared to cells treated with bortezomib alone. Conclusions shRNA knockdown of ST3GAL6 in MM cells significantly inhibits adhesion and migration in vitro with reduced homing and proliferation potential in vivo . In conjunction with the results of enzymatic inhibition this indicates that sialylation may play an important role in the malignant behavior of MM cells. Studies are ongoing to address the potential role of altered glycosylation in MM.
