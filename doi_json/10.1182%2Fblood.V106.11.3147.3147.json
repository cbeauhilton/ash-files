    "abstract_text": "Megakaryopoiesis is a highly specialized cellular process which sustains platelet production. At the end of megakaryopoiesis, megakaryocyte (MKs) fragments into platelets via long and thin cytoplasmic extensions called proplatelets. Proplatelet formation (PPF) is associated essentially with cytoskeleton changes, including actin dynamics. The Rho/Rock pathway is a well characterized regulator of the actin reorganization. In the present study, we have tried to understand the precise role of the Rho/Rock pathway in PPF from human CD34+ derived MKs. Our results show that Rho is expressed in MKs and that its expression and activity remain stable during megakaryopoiesis. Overexpression of a RhoA dominant negatif (RhoA N19) in MKs leads to an increase in PPF. Conversely overexpression of a RhoA spontaneous active (RhoA V14) in MKs leads to a decrease in PPF. These results indicate that Rho activation could inhibit PPF in vitro. It is known that Rho/ROCK promotes actin cytoskeleton dynamics by regulating myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) phosphorylation. To demonstrate that Rho/Rock inhibits PPF through MLC2 phosphorylation, we added MLC kinase inhibitor (P18), Rho inhibitor (TatC3) and ROCK inhibitor (Y27362) in MKs culture just before PPF. Western blot analysis shows that MLC2 phosphorylation was inhibited by these 3 compounds, in contrast, PPF was significantly increased. Moreover, the platelet produced have an identical size and ultrastructure as control platelets and could be normally activated. These results suggest that Rho/ROCK could inhibit PPF through MLC phosphorylation during megakaryopoiesis.",
