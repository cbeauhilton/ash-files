    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2164 Following administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) there is a marked but transient drop in circulating neutrophils. To determine the contribution of integrin activation to these events, a monoclonal antibody (mAb 24) that recognizes the activated \u03b1-subunit cation binding domain of the integrin family of receptors was used to evaluate human leukocytes following G-CSF administration. A single 480 mcg dose of human recombinant G-CSF (Neupogen, Amgen) was administered in the upper arm of six healthy human subjects (3 male, 3 female). EDTA and heparinized blood samples were collected prior to and at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 240 minutes after injection. Mean absolute neutrophil count decreased from 2,557 \u00b1 654/\u03bcl at baseline to 227 \u00b1 193 (p<0.001) at 30 and 45 minutes. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a dramatic increase in binding of mAb24, which recognizes the occupied divalent cation binding site of the activated integrin \u03b1 subunit, to neutrophils but not other circulating nucleated cells within 15 to 30 minutes after G-CSF administration, concurrent with a dramatic decrease in circulating neutrophil numbers. This activation, like the drop in neutrophil count, was transient, with a return to baseline status by 60 minutes. Intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels were also evaluated. Within 30\u201390 minutes following G-CSF injection there was a significant drop in iPTH from a baseline of 52.5 \u00b1 31.1 to a nadir value of 30.6 \u00b1 20.9 pg/ml (p=0.01). A rebound in iPTH levels to 63.4 \u00b1 27.0 pg/ml (p<0.001) occurred at 90 to 240 minutes. There were no significant changes in ionized calcium or magnesium levels. These results demonstrate that the integrin on circulating neutrophils is transiently activated following G-CSF administration and that this activation may mediate the transient neutropenia seen in this setting. In addition, alterations in PTH levels occur following G-CSF administration. As it is known that iPTH influences the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche, fluctuations in iPTH levels following G-CSF administration may play a role in HSC expansion.
