    "abstract_text": "Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Mechanisms of resistance to Bortezomib are undefined. Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) is an antiapoptotic protein, which protects tumor cells against spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In MM, specific downregulation of Mcl-1 induces apoptosis. Here, we examined the role of Mcl-1 in Bortezomib- and doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. We demonstrate that Bortezomib, but not doxorubicin, triggers caspase-dependent generation of a 28 kDa Mcl-1-fragment, in several MM cell lines, including MM.1S cells. Conversely, transient transfection of MM.1S cells with a previously reported 28 kDa Mcl-1(128\u2013350) fragment, but not with the Mcl-1(1\u2013127) fragment, induces apoptosis. Therefore, both downregulation of full-length antiapoptotic Mcl-1, as well as Bortezomib-induced generation of Mcl-1(128\u2013350) cleaved protein, contribute to MM cell apoptosis. To verify further these findings, we next compared effects triggered by Bortezomib, doxorubicin and melphalan in Mcl-1(wt/wt) and Mcl-1(Delta/null) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Our results show that Bortezomib, but not doxorubicin or melphalan, triggers Mcl-1 cleavage in Mcl-1(wt/wt), but not Mcl-1(Delta/null) MEFs and induces sub-G(1) phase cells; caspase-3 and -9, and PARP cleavage as well as morphological signs of apoptosis. Interestingly, Bortezomib-induced generation of the Mcl-1(128\u2013350) fragment was accompanied by the induction of the BH3-only protein NOXA and its increased binding to Mcl-1. Indeed, NOXA tightly binds Mcl-1 but not Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or Bcl-w, thereby displacing Bak. In turn, free Bak induces apoptosis via permeabilization of organellar membranes and induction of caspase activation. Besides Mcl-1, Bcl-XL is also a guardian of Bak.Consistent with these data, our results show that Bortezomib induces apoptosis dependent on Mcl-1. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that lack of Mcl-1 and Mcl-1 128\u2013350 fragment confers resistance to Bortezomib and protects against Bortezomib-induced caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, highlighting the complexity of Mcl-1 post-translational regulation and its role in mitochondrial and caspase-3-mediated drug-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, our results identify a new mechanism of drug resistance, implicating a role for Mcl-1 not only as an antiapoptotic protein that opposes drug-induced apoptosis, but also as a proapoptotic cleaved protein enhancing mitochondrial/caspase activation and thereby leading to apoptosis. From a clinical point of view, our results suggest the potential utility of combining therapies that trigger Mcl-1-dependent and -independent pathways, that is Bortezomib and doxorubicin or Bortezomib with histone deacetylase inhibitors (Pei et al. , 2004) and Bortezomib and doxorubicin with seliciclib, a small molecule cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (Raje et al. , 2005). Recently, Orlowski et al. (2005) have combined these two drugs and demonstrated remarkably activity in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies, supporting the potential utility of this therapeutic strategy.",
