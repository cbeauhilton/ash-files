    "abstract_text": "Novel targeted therapies have substantially improved the prognosis of patients with B cell malignancies. However, a substantial fraction of patients still relapse, even after initially achieving deep remissions. Many studies have characterized the interactions between tumor cells and their microenvironment as integral to leukemia/ lymphoma homeostasis and for the provision of survival signals, also contributing to drug resistance (referred to as environment-mediated drug resistance (EMDR)). Therapeutic efforts to antagonize microenvironment-emanating survival cues have predominantly focused on perturbation of tumour cell adhesion enabling the physical displacement from protective niches (e.g. BCR-inhibitors). In an effort to address whether direct stromal targeting could more precisely mitigate EMDR, we recently characterised the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor-stroma interactions in B cell malignancies and identified a protein kinase C-\u03b2 (PKC-\u03b2) as an essential kinase, required for activation of NF-\u03baB in mesenchymal stromal cells (Lutzny et al Cancer Cell 2013). The dependency on stroma PKC-\u03b2 was uniformly found for acute (ALL) and chronic (CLL, MCL) B cell malignancies. Importantly, our data further demonstrate that targeting stroma PKC-\u03b2 is of key importance for multi-drug resistance of malignant B cells and can be used for therapeutic interventions (Park et al Science Trans Med 2020). Here we demonstrate novel mechanistic insights into stroma-mediated drug resistance in B cell malignancies. We identified that stroma PKC-\u03b2 drives a transcriptional program in tumor cells, dependent on the activation of TGF-\u03b2 and BMP-signaling, which ultimately leads to the stabilisation of BCL-XL. Our data show that BCL-XL expression in tumor cells is associated with SMAD1-induction by cytotoxic therapies, which simultaneously suppress SMAD4 expression. Importantly, SMAD1 expression was strictly dependent on stromal PKC-\u03b2 activity. Antagonizing stroma signals with TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors inhibits SMAD1 induction, abrogates the up-regulation of BCL-XL and overcomes stroma-dependent resistance to Venetoclax and conventional chemotherapy. The TGF-\u03b2 pathway operates in parallel to the activation of the transcription factor EB (TFEB) as a down-stream target of PKC-\u03b2. Interference with these signaling pathways impairs plasma membrane integrity of stromal cells by down-regulation of numerous adhesion and signaling molecules, such as ADAM17, required for the reciprocal stabilization of BCL-XL in tumor cells. The significance of microenvironment PKC-\u03b2 for drug resistance was demonstrated in vivo, using C57B/6 mice, diseased with E\u03bcTCL-1 driven B cell tumors and treated with Venetoclax in combination with or without PKC-\u03b2 inhibitors. Combined treatment significantly prolonged survival, based on PKC-\u03b2 mediated impairment of EMDR. Similarly, concurrent treatment of PKC-\u03b2 inhibitors with chemotherapy also improved survival in an ALL-PDx model Our data demonstrate that mitigating EMDR with small molecule inhibitors of PKC-\u03b2 or TGF-\u03b2 signalling enhance the effectiveness of both targeted and non-targeted chemotherapies and moreover, has the ability to overcome Venetoclax resistance in B cell malignancies. Clinical trials with repurposed drugs inhibiting the here described pathways mediating EMDR are in planning. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.
