    "abstract_text": "Nilotinib is a rationally designed 2 nd -generation bcr-abl inhibitor. It is \u223c30-fold more potent than imatinib against wild-type bcr-abl and active against 32/33 imatinib-resistant bcr-abl mutants in preclinical models. In an open-label phase II study of nilotinib in imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML-CP patients (pts), we assessed the occurrence of mutations and the efficacy stratified by BCR-ABL mutational status. Prior to therapy, 35 mutations affecting 28 amino acids in the BCR-ABL kinase domain were identified by direct sequencing in 39% (106/270) of the pts analyzed. The incidence of baseline mutation was higher in imatinib-resistant (100/183, 55%) versus imatinib-intolerant pts (6/86, 7%). After 12 months of therapy, complete hematologic response (CHR) was achieved in 85%, major cytogenetic response (MCR) in 60%, and complete cytogenetic response (CCR) in 45% of pts without baseline mutations versus 67, 49 and 29% of pts with mutations. Among patients with baseline mutations, responses were observed broadly in all genotypes identified, but rates of responses differed by the in vitro sensitivity of the mutant clone against nilotinib. Pts with sensitive mutations of \u2264100 nM cellular IC50 had the best response rate and were comparable to pts without baseline mutations. Pts with less sensitive mutations (IC50 201\u2013800nM:Y253H, E255K, E255V, F359C) had responses but the response rate were lower then those of the two other groups (IC50 101\u2013200nM and 201\u2013800nM). The nilotinib-resistant T315I mutation (IC50>800nM) was identified at baseline in 5 cases (one pt had a limited response followed by progression). The less sensitive mutations (IC50 201\u2013800nM) and the T315I mutation occurred in 8% and 2% of all pts assessed for baseline mutations, respectively. With a median follow up of 12 months, progression occurred in 15% (25/164) versus 40% (42/106) of pts without and with baseline mutations. Nine of 18 with less sensitive baseline mutations and 3 of 5 with T315I progressed, but the baseline mutation most frequently associated with progression was F359V (7/9). In 67 cases of progression, mutational data at or within 3 months of progression were available in 28 cases. Among the 28 pts, 7 (25%) had no mutation; 9 (32%) had the same baseline mutation (including F359V in 3; Y253F/H in 3; E255K in 1; and T315I in 1). A further 12 (43%) pts showed new emerging mutations at progression, 4 with T315I, 4 E255K, 3 Y253H, and 1 F359C. The other 7 pts with emerging mutations had not progressed. In total 21 pts were found with emerging mutations, 19 (90%) had a different mutation at baseline. In summary, nilotinib responses were observed across a variety of BCR-ABL mutations. Preliminary data suggest that mutational status at baseline and/or the emergence of new mutations may influence disease progression. Less sensitive or resistant mutations represented 10% of the pt population and may be associated with less favorable responses. Longer follow up is required.",
