    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3638 Background: CAG regimen (cytarabine, aclarubicin, G-CSF) has been commonly used in China and Japan for the treatment of AML and MDS. This study is to summarize the data and to analyze the efficacy as well as the toxic effects of CAG regimen in acute leukemia (AL) and MDS pts. Methods: The databases of PubMed, Wanfang Data, as well as American Society of Hematology ( ASH ) annual meeting abstracts were searched for articles published in English, Chinese and Japanese languages between January 1995 and December 2010. Eligible studies were relevant clinical trials on AL and MDS pts treated with CAG regimen. Complete remission (CR) rates and odds ratio (OR) were compared through a meta-analysis using a random-effects or fixed-effects model. Results: 37 trials with a total of 1045 AL and MDS pts were included for analysis. Among the 1045 pts treated with CAG, 819 pts were AML, 215 pts were de novo MDS or transformed AML (MDS/tAML), 6 pts were ALL, and 5 pts were biphenotypic acute leukemia (BAL). The AML CR rate of CAG from 29 studies was 58.0% (95% CI, 53.1%-62.7%). The MDS/t-AML CR rate from 12 studies was 45.7% (95% CI, 39.0%-52.4%). The AML CR rate was significantly better than that of MDS /tAML (Q=8.072, p0.05). The CR rate for the 367 elderly AML pts was 52% (95% CI 51.5%-62.3%). The CR rate was also significantly higher in pts with favorable (64.5%, 95% CI 38.8%-83.9%) and intermediate (69.6%, 95% CI 60.4%-77.5%) cytogenetics than those with unfavorable one (29.5%, 95% CI 19.7%-41.8%) (p<0.05). There were 7 trials that compared the CR rates of CAG regimen with those of other induction regimens in AML pts. Surprisingly, the CR rate of CAG was significantly higher than those of other induction regimens (OR 2.425, 95% CI, 1.515\u20133.880). CAG regimens were well tolerated with cardiotoxicity in 0.42% cases (4/954) and early death occurred in 4.40% cases (44/1000). Conclusions: CAG regimen induced significantly higher CR rates in AML than in MDS pts. The CR rates of CAG regimen was significantly better than those of other induction regimens in AML pts. This regimen was well tolerated with low cardiotoxicity and early death rate. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
