    "abstract_text": "HuM195, a humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody, targets myeloid leukemia cells and has single-agent activity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To enhance the potency of native HuM195 and avoid nonspecific cytotoxicity seen with \u03b2-emitting radioimmunoconjugates, the \u03b1-emitting radiometal 213 Bi was conjugated to HuM195. The feasibility, safety, and antileukemic activity of 213 Bi-HuM195 were shown in a phase I trial (Jurcic et al. Blood 2002). Because of the short-range (50\u201380 \u03bcm) and high linear energy transfer (8400 keV) of \u03b1 particles, radioimmunotherapy with 213 Bi is ideally suited for the treatment of residual disease. To determine the effects of 213 Bi-HuM195 against cytoreduced disease, we treated 31 patients (median age, 67 years; range, 37\u201380) with cytarabine 200 mg/m 2 /day for 5 days followed by 213 Bi-HuM195 in a phase I/II trial. Thirteen patients had untreated AML (5 with de novo AML; 8 with secondary AML). Eight patients had AML in untreated first relapse, and ten patients had heavily pretreated relapsed AML (n=7) or primary refractory AML (n=3). Nine patients had poor-risk cytogenetics. During the phase I portion of the study, cohorts of 3\u20136 patients were treated with 18.5, 27.75, 37, and 46.25 MBq/kg. Prolonged myelosuppression with grade 4 leukopenia > 35 days was the most common dose-limiting toxicity. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 37 MBq/kg. Extramedullary toxicity was primarily limited to \u2264 grade 2 events, including infusion-related reactions; however, grade 3/4 liver function abnormalities were seen in four patients (13%). Treatment-related deaths occurred in two of 21 patients (10%) who received the MTD. Significant reductions in marrow blasts were seen at all dose levels, and clinical responses were observed in 6 of the 25 patients (24%) who received doses of at least 37 MBq/kg (2 CR, 2 CRp, 2 PR). The median response duration was 7.7 months (range, 2\u201312). Pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies suggested that saturation of all available CD33 sites by 213 Bi-HuM195 was possible after cytoreduction with cytarabine. Sequential administration of cytarabine and 213 Bi-HuM195 is tolerable and can produce complete remissions in patients with AML."
