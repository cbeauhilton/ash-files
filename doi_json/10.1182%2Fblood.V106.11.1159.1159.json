    "abstract_text": "Backround: Arsenic trioxide (ATO), an active agent against multiple myeloma, has been shown to be synergistic with melphalan both in vitro and in vivo. We conducted a phase I/II trial to determine the safety and efficacy of a combination of arsenic trioxide, melphalan and ascorbic acid (AA) as prepaprative regimen in patients undergoing high-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (AHPCT) for multiple myeloma (MM). We also assessed the impact ATO levels on melphalan pharmacokinetics (PK), engraftment and toxicity. Methods: Twenty-five patients with secretory myeloma (11 females, 14 males median age: 53, range: 49 \u2013 69) were treated b/w 4/04 and 1/05. All patient received melphalan 100 mg/m 2 IV on days -4 and -3 and AA 1000 mg/day IV on days \u22129 to \u22123. Patients were randomized to 3 arms; no ATO (arm 1), ATO 0.15 mg/kg IV on days \u22129 to \u22123 (arm 2) and ATO 0.25 mg/kg IV on days \u22129 to \u22123 (arm 3). Seven patients had a prior autograft. Median CD34 cells dose infused was 4.4 x 10 6 /kg (range 2.3\u201310.9). Results: Patients were evenly matched except for a high median \u03b2 2 m level (3.6 vs. 2.4 in arms 1 and 2, p=0.04) in arm 3. With a median F/U of 7.1 months post autograft, no dose-limiting toxicity or non-relapse mortality was seen. Median ATO level on day 0 in arms 1, 2 and 3 were 0.2, 26.3 and 46.2 ng/ml, respectively. Toxicity was limited grade I or II nausea, vomitting and diarrhea. Median time to neutrophil engraftment (ANC >500/dl) was 9 days. There were no engraftment failures or delays in the ATO arms. Response rates (RR) are shown in Table 1. With a median F/U of 7.1 months (range, 6.4 \u2013 8.9 months), the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) are as shown in Figure 1. There was no significant difference in RR, PFS or OS between the 3 arms. Melphalan PK was not altered by ATO pretreatment. Conclusions: Arsenic trioxide, given in combination with melphalan and ascorbic acid as preparative regimen, is safe and well tolerated. A longer follow up is needed to determine the impact of this combination on survival. Response Rate at 3-Month Evaluation . Response at 3 months . . . . . CR . PR . MR . SD .
