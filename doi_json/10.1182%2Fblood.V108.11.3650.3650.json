    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSC) are routinely obtained from bone marrow, mobilized peripheral blood, and umbilical Cord Blood. Traditionally, adult bone marrow has been utilized as a source of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC). Bone marrow derived MSC (BM-MSC) have previously been shown to maintain the growth of HSC obtained from cord blood and have been utilized for cord blood expansion purposes. However, the use of a mismatched BM-MSC feeder stromal layer to support the long term culture of cord blood HSC is not ideal for transplant purposes. The isolation of MSC from a novel source, the Wharton\u2019s Jelly of Umbilical Cord segments, was recently reported ( Romanov Y, et al. Stem Cells.  2003 ; 21 : 105 \u2013110 ) ( Lee O, et al. Blood.  2004 ; 103 : 1669 \u20131675 ). We therefore hypothesized that Umbilical Cord derived MSC (UC-MSC) have the ability to support the long term growth of cord blood derived HSC similar to that previously reported for BM-MSC. To test this hypothesis, MSC were isolated from the Wharton\u2019s Jelly of Umbilical Cord segments and defined morphologically and by cell surface markers. UC-MSC were then tested for their ability to support the growth of pooled CD34 + cord blood cells in long term culture - initiating cell (LTC-IC) assays as compared to BM-MSC. We observed that like BM-MSC, CB-MSC express a defined set of cell surface markers. By flow cytometry we determined that that both UC-MSC and BM-MSC are positive for CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD166, HLA-A and negative for CD45, CD34, CD38, CD117, HLA-DR expression. Utilizing Mitomycin C treated (200 \u03bcM, 15 min.) UC-MSC from multiple donors as a feeder layer we observed that UC-MSC have the ability to support the maintenance of long term hematopoiesis during the LTC-IC assay. Specifically, UC-MSC isolated from separate umbilical cord donors support the growth of 69.6\u00b111.9 (1A), 31.7\u00b13.9 (2B), 67.0\u00b113.5 (3A), and 38.5\u00b113.7 (3B) colony forming cells (CFC) per 1\u00d710 4 CD34 + cord blood cells as compared to 64.0\u00b14.2 CFC per 1\u00d710 4 CD34 + cord blood cells supported by BM-MSC (Mean\u00b1SEM, N=4 separate segments from three different donors). Thus, Umbilical Cord derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells, a recently described novel source of MSC, have the ability to support long term maintenance of Hematopoietic Stem Cells, as defined by the LTC-IC assay. These results may have potential therapeutic application with respect to ex vivo stem cell expansion of Cord Blood Hematopoietic Stem Cells utilizing a Mesenchymal Stem Cell stromal layer. In addition, these data suggest the possibility of co-transplantation of matched Mesenchymal and Hematopoietic Stem Cells from the same umbilical cord and cord blood donor respectively. Lastly, these results describe a novel model system for the future study of the interaction between Cord Blood Hematopoietic Stem Cells and the appropriate supportive microenvironment represented by the Umbilical Cord - Mesenchymal Stem Cells.",
