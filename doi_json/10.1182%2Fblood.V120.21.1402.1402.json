    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1402 Over 20 different fusion partner genes of NUP98 have been reported in hematological malignancies with the majority of NUP98 fusions occurring in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recently, a specific fusion of NUP98 with Nuclear receptor-binding SET domain protein 1 (NSD1) has been analyzed in a large cohort of pediatric and adult AML patients. In this report, 16.1% of pediatric AML samples and 2.3% of adult cytogentically normal (CN)-AML cases were found to be NUP98/NSD1 -positive. NUP98/NSD1 -positive patients had an adverse outcome. The aim of our study was to investigate the frequency, clinical features and the prognostic impact of NUP98/NSD1 in another large, uniformily treated adult AML cohort, and in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, which frequently precede overt leukemia. We studied 504 younger AML patients (<60 years) and 193 MDS patients for the presence of NUP98/NSD1 translocations. Analysis in the AML cohort was also performed for mutations in FLT3- ITD, NPM1, DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2. Additional mutation analyses were performed in the subgroup of CN-AML for CEBPA, MLL-PTD, WT1 and WT1 SNP rs16754 , NRAS . The NUP98/NSD1 fusion was identified by a nested RT-PCR using patient-derived cDNA. cDNA from a patient with proven NUP98-NSD1 fusion was used as a positive control. NUP98/NSD1 fusions were identified in 7 out of 504 younger adult AML patients (1.4%) while the NUP98/NSD1 fusion was not found in any of the 193 MDS patients. In the AML cohort, NUP98/NSD1 positive patients showed a higher number of peripheral blood blasts (P=.002), while other clinical characteristics such as FAB-subtype, type of AML, hemoglobin levels, white cell count or platelet count did not significantly differ between patients with or without the NUP98/NSD1 fusion. The majority of NUP98/NSD1 positive patients (5 out of 7) showed a normal karyotype while one patient was found to have a del(9) and another patient an inv(3)(q21q26) with monosomy 7. We identified an association between FLT3- ITD and NUP98/NSD1 fusion in our cohort (P=.007, 5 patients with NUP98/NSD1 also had a FLT3 -ITD). This finding confirms the data by Hollink et al. and suggests a possible functional link between FLT3-ITD and the NUP98/NSD1 fusion in leukemogenesis. NUP98/NSD1 fusions were not associated with other mutations like those suggested in epigenetic regulation ( DNMT3A , IDH1 and IDH2 ). In CN-AML, we also looked for an association between BAALC , ERG, EVI1, MN1 , MLL5 and WT1 expression but did not find a significant difference between the expression of these genes and NUP98/NSD1 fusion genes. Due to the low frequency of the aberration outcome analysis was performed for explorative purposes. Considering the whole AML cohort we did not detect a significant difference for OS and for RFS between NUP98/NSD1 positive and negative patients (OS, HR 1.6; 95%CI 0.66\u20133.88; P=.3; RFS, HR 2.33; 95%CI 0.74\u20137.30; P=.147). However, NUP98/NSD1 positive patients had significantly lower complete remission (CR) rates (43 vs. 77 percent, P=.037). When considering only patients with CN-AML the NUP98/NSD1 positive patients (n=5) had no significantly different OS and RFS (OS, HR 2.08; 95%CI 0.77\u20135.64; P=.15; RFS, HR 2.88; 95%CI 0.71\u201311.71; P=.14). Again, a significantly lower CR rate was observed in the NUP98/NSD1 positive patients compared to NUP98/NSD1 negative patients with CN-AML (40 vs. 80 percent, P=.03). Because of the association between FLT3-ITD and NUP98/NSD1 we also investigated the prognostic impact in the subgroup of CN-AML patients also positive for FLT3-ITD . Again, OS and RFS did not differ between NUP98/NSD1 positive and negative patients (OS, HR 1.31; 95%CI 0.47\u20133.64; P=.61; RFS, HR 2.04; 95%CI 0.49\u20138.57; P=.33). For this subgroup a trend towards a lower CR rate was observed for NUP98/NSD1 positive FLT3-ITD positive CN-AML patients (40 vs 75 percent, P=.08). In summary, our analysis confirms the presence but low incidence of the NUP98/NSD1 fusion gene in adult AML patients and the strong association with FLT3-ITD. The specific association of NUP98/NSD1 with FLT3 -ITD mutations warrants clinical investigation with FLT3 inhibitors in these patients. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
