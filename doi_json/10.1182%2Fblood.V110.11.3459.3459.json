    "abstract_text": "All trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induces remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) by induction of granulocytic differentiation. Since CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b5 play important roles in normal granulocytic differentiation we compared their expression and regulation in ATRA differentiation inducible NB4 and HL-60 cells to their ATRA differentiation resistant subclones R4 and HL-60/Res cells. All four cell lines robustly express C/EBP\u03b1 but have low or absent C/EBP\u03b2 and \u03b5 expression. ATRA treatment increases the levels of C/EBP\u03b2 and \u03b5 protein in NB4 and HL-60 cells but not in the R4 and HL-60/Res cells which is correlated with the degree of differentiation induction. Knockdown of C/EBP\u03b2 or \u03b5 using shRNA decreases ATRA differentiation induction of HL-60 cells. HL-60 cells with BCR-ABL stable transfection lose expression of C/EBP\u03b1, and ATRA-induced differentiation and expression of C/EBP\u03b2 and \u03b5 are no longer seen. K562 cells which express BCR-ABL do not have detectable or inducible C/EBP\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b5 after ATRA treatment and are resistant to ATRA differentiation induction. Ectopic expression of C/EBP\u03b1-estrogen receptor (ER) or C/EBP\u03b2-ER, but not C/EBP\u03b5-ER, induces granulocytic differentiation in K562 cells after addition of estradiol or tamoxifen which activates these fusion factors. C/EBP\u03b1-ER or C/EBP\u03b2-ER infected K562 cells is followed by induction of C/EBP\u03b5 expression and knockdown of C/EBP\u03b5 in C/EBP\u03b1-ER or C/EBP\u03b2-ER infected K562 cells decreases induction of differentiation. The induction of C/EBP\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b5 expression by ATRA is investigated in ten additional myeloid leukemia cell lines and it is found that the expression of C/EBP\u03b2 and \u03b5, but not C/EBP\u03b1, are induced in THP-1 and ML-1 cells which are responsive to ATRA differentiation induction. These results indicate that induction of C/EBP\u03b2 is required and C/EBP\u03b5 plays a collaborative role with C/EBP\u03b2 in ATRA-induced differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells."
