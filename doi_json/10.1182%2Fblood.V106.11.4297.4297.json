    "abstract_text": "Objective To explore the inducing differentiation and apoptosis in a novel human acute monocytic leukemic cell line SHI-1. Methods Cell morphological analysis, NBT reduction test, the expression of CD11b and CD14, cell cycle analysis and binding of annexinV tested by FCM, DNA electrophoresis were performed to evaluate whether tributyrin (TB), arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3 ), and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13 acetate (TPA) could induce the differentiation and apoptosis in the SHI-1 cell line. Results The results of morphological analysis, NBT reduction test, and FCM assay showed that TB could induce differentiation of SHI-1 cells. The SHI-1 cell line presented typical apoptotic evidences including morphology features, DNA ladders and the increased apoptotic rate determined by FCM. Moreover, the SHI-1 cell line presented typical apoptotic morphology after being treated with As 2 O 3 . The apoptotic rate of the SHI-1 cell line treated with As 2 O 3 was increased determined by FCM. The expression level of CD14 was upregulated while that of CD11b was unchanged in the SHI-1 cell line. Most of the SHI-1 cells adhered to the flask after being treated with TPA for 24 hours. Conclusions TB may produce dual effects of differentiation and apoptosis. The cell line could be induced to differentiation partially or apoptosis after being treated with 0.5\u03bcM, 1.0\u03bcM, and 2.0\u03bcM As2O3. TPA could induce differentiation and adhesion of the SHI-1 cell line.",
