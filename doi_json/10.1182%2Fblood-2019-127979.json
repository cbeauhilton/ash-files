    "abstract_text": "Classification of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) based on the immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) gene somatic hypermutation (SHM) status has established predictive and prognostic relevance. The SHM status is assessed based on the number of mutations within the sequence of the rearranged IGHV gene excluding the VH CDR3. This is mostly due to the difficulty in discriminating actual SHM from random nucleotides added between the recombined IGHV, IGHD and IGHJ genes. Hence, this approach may underestimate the true impact of SHM, in fact overlooking the most critical region for antigen-antibody interactions i.e. the VH CDR3. Relevant to mention in this respect, studies from our group in CLL with mutated IGHV genes (M-CLL), particularly subset #4, have revealed considerable intra-VH CDR3 diversity attributed to ongoing SHM. Prompted by these findings, here we investigated whether SHM may also be present in cases bearing 'truly unmutated' IGHV genes (i.e. 100% germline identity across VH FR1-VH FR3), focusing on two well characterized stereotyped subsets i.e. subset #1 (IGHV clan I/IGHD6-19/IGHJ4) and subset #6 (IGHV1-69/IGHD3-16/IGHJ3). These subsets carry germline-encoded amino acid (aa) motifs within the VH CDR3, namely QWL and YDYVWGSY, originating from the IGHD6-19 and IGHD3-16 gene, respectively. However, in both subsets, cases exist with variations in these motifs that could potentially represent SHM. The present study included 12 subset #1 and 5 subset #6 patients with clonotypic IGHV genes lacking any SHM (100% germline identity). IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ gene rearrangements were RT-PCR amplified by subgroup-specific leader primers and a high-fidelity polymerase in order to ensure high data quality. RT-PCR products were subjected to paired-end NGS on the MiSeq platform. Sequence annotation was performed with IMGT/HighV-QUEST and metadata analysis was undertaken using an in-house purpose-built bioinformatics pipeline. Rearrangements with the same IGHV gene and identical VH CDR3 aa sequences were defined as clonotypes. Overall, we obtained 1,570,668 productive reads with V-region identity 99-100%; of these, 1,232,958 (mean: 102,746, range: 20,796-242,519) concerned subset #1 while 337,710 (mean: 67,542, range: 50,403-79,683) concerned subset #6. On average, 64.4% (range: 1.7-77.5%) of subset #1 reads and 49.2% (range: 0.7-70%) of subset #6 reads corresponded to rearrangements with IGHV genes lacking any SHM (100% germline identity). Clonotype computation revealed 1,831 and 1,048 unique clonotypes for subset #1 and #6, respectively. Subset #1 displayed a mean of 157 distinct clonotypes per sample (range: 74-267), with the dominant clonotype having a mean frequency of 96.9% (range: 96-98.2%). Of note, 44 clonotypes were shared between different patients (albeit at varying frequencies), including the dominant clonotype of 11/12 cases, which was present in 2-6 additional subset #1 patients. Subset #6 cases carried a higher number of distinct clonotypes per sample (mean: 219, range: 189-243) while the dominant clonotype had a mean frequency of 95.6% (range: 94.5-96.5%). Shared clonotypes (n=30) were identified also in subset #6 and the dominant clonotype of each subset #6 case was present in 3-5 additional subset #6 patients. Focusing on the VH CDR3, in particular the IGHD-encoded part, the following observations were made: (1) in both subsets, extensive intra-VH CDR3 variation was detected at certain positions within the IGHD gene; (2) in most cases, the observed aa substitutions were conservative i.e. concerned aa sharing similar physicochemical properties. Particularly noteworthy in this respect were the observations in subset #6 that: (i) the valine residue (V) in the D-derived YDYVWGSY motif was very frequently mutated to another aliphatic residue (A, I, L); (ii) in cases were the predominant clonotype carried I (also in the Sanger-derived sequence), several minor clonotypes carried the germline-encoded V, compelling evidence that the observed substitution concerned true SHM. In conclusion, we provide immunogenetic evidence for intra-VH CDR3 variations, very likely attributed to SHM, in CLL patients carrying 'truly unmutated' IGHV genes. While the prognostic/predictive relevance of this observation is beyond the scope of the present work, our findings highlight the possible need to reappraise definitions ('semantics') regarding SHM status in CLL.
