    "abstract_text": "Activating mutations in RAS and somatic loss-of-function mutations in the ten-eleven translocation 2 ( TET2 ) are frequently detected in hematologic malignancies. Global genomic sequencing revealed the co-occurrence of RAS and TET2 mutations in chronic myelomonocytic leukemias (CMMLs) and acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), suggesting that the two mutations collaborate to induce malignant transformation. However, how the two mutations interact with each other, and the effects of co-existing RAS and TET2 mutations on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and leukemogenesis, remains unknown. In this study, we generated conditional Mx1-Cre + ; Nras LSL-G12D/+ ; Tet2 fl/+ mice (double mutant) and activated the expression of mutant Nras and Tet2 in hematopoietic tissues with poly(I:C) injections. Double mutant mice had significantly reduced survival compared to mice expressing only Nras G12D/+ or Tet2 +/- (single mutants). Hematopathology and flow-cytometry analyses showed that these mice developed accelerated CMML-like phenotypes with higher myeloid cell infiltrations in the bone marrow and spleen as compared to single mutants. However, no cases of AML occurred. Given that CMML is driven by dys-regulated HSC function, we examined stem cell competitiveness, self-renewal and proliferation in double mutant mice at the pre-leukemic stage. The absolute numbers of HSCs in 10-week old double mutant mice were comparable to that observed in wild type (WT) and single mutant mice. However, double mutant HSCsdisplayed significantly enhanced self-renewal potential in colony forming (CFU) replating assays. In vivo competitive serial transplantation assays using either whole bone marrow cells or 15 purified SLAM (CD150 + CD48 - Lin - Sca1 + cKit + ) HSCs showed that while single mutant HSCs have increased competitiveness and self-renewal compared to WT HSCs, double mutants have further enhanced HSC competitiveness and self-renewal in primary and secondary transplant recipients. Furthermore, i n vivo BrdU incorporation demonstrated that while Nras mutant HSCs had increased proliferation rate, Tet2 mutation significantly reduced the level of HSC proliferation in double mutants. Consistent with this, in vivo H2B-GFP label-retention assays (Liet. al. Nature 2013) in the Col1A1-H2B-GFP;Rosa26-M2-rtTA transgenic mice revealed significantly higher levels of H2B-GFP in Tet2 mutant HSCs, suggesting that Tet2 haploinsufficiency reduced overall HSC cycling. Overall, these findings suggest that hyperactive Nras signaling and Tet2 haploinsufficiency collaborate to enhance HSC competitiveness through distinct functions: N-Ras G12D increases HSC self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation, while Tet2 haploinsufficiency reduces HSC proliferation to maintain HSCs in a more quiescent state. Consistent with this, gene expression profiling with RNA sequencing on purified SLAM HSCs indicated thatN-Ras G12D and Tet2haploinsufficiencyinduce different yet complementary cellular programs to collaborate in HSC dys-regulation. To fully understand how N-Ras G12D and Tet2dose reduction synergistically modulate HSC properties, we examined HSC response to cytokines important for HSC functions. We found that when HSCs were cultured in the presence of low dose stem cell factor (SCF) and thrombopoietin (TPO), only Nras single mutant and Nras/Tet2 double mutant HSCs expanded, but not WT or Tet2 single mutant HSCs. In the presence of TPO and absence of SCF, HSC expansion was only detected in the double mutants. These results suggest that HSCs harboring single mutation of Nras are hypersensitive to cytokine signaling, yet the addition of Tet2 mutation allows for further cytokine independency. Thus, N-Ras G12D and Tet2 dose reduction collaborate to promote cytokine signaling. Together, our data demonstrate that hyperactive Nras and Tet2 haploinsufficiency collaborate to alter global HSC gene expression and sensitivity to stem cell cytokines. These events lead to enhanced HSC competitiveness and self-renewal, thus promoting transition toward advanced myeloid malignancy. This model provides a novel platform to delineate how mutations of signaling molecules and epigenetic modifiers collaborate in leukemogenesis, and may identify opportunities for new therapeutic interventions.
