    "abstract_text": "Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are powerful tools that enable MHC-independent activation of T cells. Recent reports have indicated that constitutive, low-level (tonic) signaling by CARs can impair the utility of the engineered T cells. The single-chain antibody (scFv) binding domain was one of the features determined to promote tonic signaling. We have recently developed a novel chimeric receptor, known as the T cell antigen coupler (TAC), that is less prone to tonic signaling than second-generation CARs. The TAC consists of a scFv-based antigen binding domain, a CD3-binding domain that couples the TAC to endogenous T cell receptor (TCR), and a transmembrane and cytoplasmic coreceptor (CD4) domain. In contrast to CARs, this design enables TAC-T cells to signal through the endogenous TCR, which we propose provides a fidelity to natural T cell signal regulation. Interestingly, we have recently reported that CAR-T cells have a greater propensity for off-target activation than TAC-T cells, suggesting a safety advantage to TAC-T cells (Helsen et al., Nat. Comm., 2019). Further characterization of the differences between CAR- and TAC-T cell signal initiation and activation is required to understand how their design affects sensitivity, specificity and regulation of T cell activation. Examination of the activation requirements for BCMA-specific CAR-T cells and TAC-T cells confirmed that TAC-T cells are reliant upon the endogenous TCR for T cell activation whereas CAR-T cells are TCR-independent. TRAC knock-out CAR-T cells retained potent effector function at levels similar to CAR-T cells with intact TCR expression, whereas TRAC knock-out TAC T-cells showed significant impairment in effector function. Consistent with TCR-dependence, the immunological synapse produced by TAC-T cells displays all the hallmarks of a conventional immunological synapse, whereas CAR-T cells form unconventional synapses. Unlike TAC-T cells, immunological synapses formed by CAR-T cells display non-uniform central supramolecular activation clusters, disperse Lck distribution, a lack of an LFA-1 associated adhesion ring (Figure), as well as more disperse delivery of perforin to the cell interface. CAR-T cells also formed synapses faster than TAC-T cells. This suggests that while TAC T-cells are beholden to the requirement of organized, mature synapse formation, CAR T-cells can rapidly form less structurally organized synapses. Transcriptional profiling of CAR-T cells in the absence of antigen stimulation revealed a basal activation status associated with upregulation of Nur77, a transcription factor that is downstream of TCR activation. Transcriptional profiling of TAC-T cells failed to reveal evidence of TCR signaling in the absence of stimulation. Further evaluation of CAR- and TAC- T cells in the absence of stimulation revealed elevated levels of CD69, PD-1 and LAG-3 in CAR-T cells compared with TAC-T cells, as well as higher expression of IL-2, IFN\u03b3, and TNF in CAR-T cells. Interestingly, the level of tonic signaling was dependent on the antigen-binding scFV, as otherwise identical BCMA-specific CAR- and TAC-T cells displayed different levels of CD69, PD-1 and LAG-3 depending on the identity of the BCMA-specific scFv. Despite different levels of basal activation, both CAR- and TAC-T cells displayed comparable activation kinetics as measured by upregulation of CD69 and Ki-67, as well as proliferation. However, the elevated level of basal activation rendered the CAR-T cells more easily activated by a cross-reactive off-target antigen that failed to stimulate TAC-T cells carrying the same binding domain. These data suggest that the TAC receptor offers a valuable alternate platform to CAR-T cells. The antigen-binding scFv domain has a direct impact on tonic signaling and basal activation in CAR-T cells. Conversely, TAC-T cells are less susceptible to basal activation and this works suggests that the TAC receptor can deploy scFv binding domains that are not suitable for CARs.
