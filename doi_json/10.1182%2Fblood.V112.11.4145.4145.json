    "abstract_text": "The t(14;18)(q32;q21) involving the MALT1 and IGH genes is a recurrent abnormality in MALT lymphomas. So far, molecular genetic characterization of the t(14;18)/ IGHMALT1 has only been performed in 2 cases and revealed a fusion of the entire coding region of MALT1 to the IGH locus. We herein report the molecular genetic analyses of 2 new cases of MALT lymphoma harboring the t(14;18)/ IGH - MALT1 using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and we determined the molecular characteristics at the IGH - MALT1 junctions using long-distance PCR (LD-PCR). The first case, a 71-year-old female, presented with an extranodal MALT lymphoma of the conjunctiva, stage I E A. The second case, a 53-year-old-male patient, was diagnosed as having a MALT lymphoma originating from the lung. FISH with PAC clones 117B5 and 59N7 revealed a translocation involving MALT1 . Further FISH assays with probes hybridizing to MALT1 and IGH showed the t(14;18)(q32;q21)/ IGH - MALT1 . By FISH with specific probes for the P53 , P16 , RB1 , and ATM genes no deletions of these genes were found. The IGH - MALT1 fusion was confirmed by LD-PCR on patients\u2019 DNA with nested primers for the MALT1 and IGH genes. Cloning and sequencing of the purified PCR products revealed a fusion of sequences upstream of the coding region of MALT1 to the J H segment of the IGH locus in both cases. The breaks on chromosome 18 were located in the 5\u2032 non-coding region of MALT1 , only 13 nucleotides apart from each other. The breaks at IGH were located in the J H 4 joining segment in both cases and showed features of a V(D)J-mediated recombination. Deletion and \u201cde novo\u201d nucleotides additions at the point of joining were observed in case 1. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the \u201cde novo\u201d nucleotides additions in this case revealed the presence of D H segments of the D H gene D3-10 in the J H /MALT1 junction. Our findings indicate that the pathomechanism underlying the t(14;18)/ IGH - MALT1 in MALT lymphomas is probably based on an illegitimate V(D)J recombination at IGH , similar to other IGH -associated translocations, such as the t(14;18)/ IGH - BCL2 in follicular lymphomas and the t(11;14)/ CCND1 - IGH in mantle cell lymphomas and that the events leading to the t(14;18)/ IGH - MALT1 might take place during an initial D H -to- J H or a later V H -to- DJ H joining.",
