    "abstract_text": "Transgenic human CD40 ligand (hCD40L) activates B-Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL) cells by CD40 stimulation and may thereby enhance their capacity to present tumor antigens. Pre-clinical models show that co-expression of IL-2 further potentiates the immunogenicity of CD40L-expressing tumor cells. To discover whether these promising pre-clinical data could usefully be applied to patients with B-CLL, we used adenovectors to prepare hIL2- and hCD40L-expressing autologous tumor vaccines. Within these vaccines, a mean of 92% B-CLL cells were CD40L positive (versus 1/1500 post vaccination) and of Granzyme-B expressing T-cells (1/2500 post). This reactivity is mediated at least in part by CD8-positive T cells with specificity to survivin, a known B-CLL associated tumor antigen. Although these immunologic effects have as yet been accompanied by only transient disease responses, our continuing accrual of additional patients who will receive immunomodulatory doses of vaccine should indicate whether the approach could contribute to the management of early or advanced B-CLL."
