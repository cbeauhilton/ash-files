    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4033 Adoptive immunotherapy with cytomegalovirus (CMV) specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) is an effective strategy for preventing and treating viral reactivation following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We have previously shown that CMV CTL can be generated in 1\u20132 weeks by stimulating donor lymphocytes with peptide mixes derived from full length pp65 and IE1. We conducted a multi-institutional study of CMV specific CTL for patients with persistent or anti-viral resistant CMV infections following allogeneic SCT, to determine the safety, feasibility, and immunologic effects of this approach. We were successful in stimulating CTL from 10/10 donors with pooled CMV overlapping peptide mixes. Five of the 7 subjects who met infusion criteria had new onset CMV specific CTL activity detected within 4\u20136 weeks post infusion. Of the two subjects who did not have immunologic responses post-infusion, one received CTL with a low viability post-thawing, and the other patient was receiving cyclosporine A and systemic corticosteroids at the time of the infusion, achieving only a low, transient increase (10%) in pp65 specific activity. There was no GVHD attributable to these infusions. These findings indicate that the infusion of CTL stimulated over 1\u20132 weeks with overlapping CMV peptides can result in virus specific immune reconstitution in SCT recipients, without exacerbations of GVHD.
