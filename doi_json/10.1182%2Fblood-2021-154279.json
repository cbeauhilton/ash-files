    "abstract_text": "Background: Dysfunction of T cells, NK cells and other immune subsets is common in patients (pts) with CLL and Richter's transformation (RT). Venetoclax (VEN), a BCL-2 inhibitor and obinutuzumab (OBIN), a CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) have clinical activity in pts with DLBCL and RT (Davids, JCO 2017; Davids, ASCO 2020). Atezolizumab, a PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor (CPI), is approved for melanoma, lung cancer and other solid tumors. Preclinical studies showed synergy of VEN and CD20 mAb with CPI (Kohlhapp, Cancer Discovery 2021; Westin, Lancet Oncology 2014). Clinical studies have shown activity of PD1 inhibition in pts with RT (Ding, Blood 2017; Jain, ASH 2018). To our knowledge, no prior study has evaluated PD-L1 inhibition in pts with RT and DLBCL histology. Methods: This is an investigator-initiated Phase II trial of combined VEN, OBIN and atezolizumab in pts with RT (NCT02846623). Eligibility criteria included age \u226518 years, adequate organ function (total bilirubin \u22641.5 x ULN, ALT and AST \u22642.5 x ULN, creatinine \u22641.5 x ULN). Pts with either previously untreated or relapsed/refractory (R/R) RT were enrolled. Pts who received prior treatment with VEN were excluded. OBIN was given at a flat dose of 100mg IV Cycle (C)1 Day (D)1, 900 mg C1D2, 1000mg on C1D8, 1000mg on C1D15 and then 1000mg on C2-9 D1. Atezolizumab was given at a flat dose of 1680 mg IV (split over 2 days) on C1D3-4 and then C2-9D1-2. VEN was initiated at the start of C2 with weekly dose-escalation (20mg daily to a target dose of 800mg daily) and continued daily until end of C26 (total 24 cycles of VEN). Response assessments were done with PET imaging and bone marrow aspirate/biopsy with MRD assessment (multi-color flow cytometry; sensitivity 10 -4 ) at the end of C1 (prior to VEN initiation), end of C4, end of C9, and end of C26. Results: From March 2020 to June 2021, a total of 8 pts were enrolled with DLBCL RT. The median follow-up is 11.2 months. Newly diagnosed RT (n=7) : Seven pts had newly diagnosed RT. The median age was 70 years (range, 52-80); 4 pts were \u226570 years; 4 pts were female. Previous therapy for CLL included ibrutinib, n=4; chlorambucil + OBIN and then acalabrutinib, n=1; BR, n=1; one pt had no prior therapy for CLL). CLL IGHV mutation status was available for 6 pts and all 6 were IGHV unmutated. CLL FISH panel showed del(17p) (n=4), del(11q) (n=1), trisomy 12 (n=1), and normal (n=1). Three pts had complex karyotype. Three pts had a TP53 mutation and 2 pts had a NOTCH1 mutation. All 7/7 (100%) pts achieved a response (complete metabolic response, n=5; partial metabolic response, n=2). Three pts proceeded to an allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) in complete metabolic remission after 4.1, 4.2 and 6.6 months; these 3 pts also achieved bone marrow undetectable (U)-MRD remission. One of these pts who went to allo-SCT has subsequently relapsed and is currently receiving a salvage regimen. One pt achieved partial metabolic remission and relapsed in C8, prior to a planned allo-SCT; this patient is now in remission after receiving a non-covalent BTK inhibitor. Three pts are continuing to receive treatment on the trial in C2, C5 and C12. Details about 2 pts including PET imaging and bone marrow findings are provided in Figures 1-2 . Majority of the responses were seen after the introduction of VEN in C2; however, 1 pt achieved complete metabolic response and bone marrow U-MRD remission after C1 with combined atezolizumab and OBIN (prior to VEN initiation). Progression-free survival without censoring for transplant is shown in Figure 3 . No pt has died. One pt developed CPI-induced pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus. One pt required dose reduction of VEN to 400mg daily. R/R RT (n=1) : One pt (58-year-old male) with previously untreated CLL (unmutated IGHV, del(17p), TP53 mutation, NOTCH1 mutation) developed RT and received R-CHOP for 3 cycles with no response. The pt was subsequently enrolled on the current trial but did not respond. Conclusions: Treatment with combined VEN, OBIN and atezolizumab leads to high rates of remission in pts with previously untreated RT; all 7 pts achieved a remission and 3 pts proceeded to allo-SCT. With the limitation of small numbers, these results are encouraging in relation to combined ibrutinib plus nivolumab in previously untreated RT (7/14, 50% response rate; Jain, ASH 2018). Enrollment in the trial continues and updated data will be presented at the ASH meeting.
