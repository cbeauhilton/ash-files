    "abstract_text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a homozygous mutation in the \u03b2-globin gene, which leads to erythrocyte sickling, vaso-occlusion, and premature hemolysis . Vaso-occlusion and hemolysis are the two predominant pathophysiologic events in SCD that contribute to chronic organ damage and acute systemic painful vaso-occlusive episode (VOE). Previous studies both in vivo and in vitro have confirmed the role of endothelial and platelet adhesion marker P-selectin in sickle cell vasoocclusive crisis. Moreover, a phase 2 study showed a significant reduction in painful vaso-occlusive episodes among SCD patients receiving the P-selectin-blocking antibody crizanlizumab . However, the long-term effect of crizanlizumab in SCD and associated organ injuries is not known. To understand the roles and regulation of P-selectin dependent vasoocclusion in SCD associated organ injuries, we have introduced the first SCD mice genetically lacking P-selectin in hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic compartments. Using this model (SS- Selp \u2212/\u2212 ) we have shown that P-selectin deficiency protects SCD mice from lung vaso-occlusion. Here we have used this model to study the liver injury in SCD. Using quantitative liver intravital imaging (qLIM) technique, we show that P-selectin deficiency protects SCD mice from liver vaso-occlusion. However, we found persistent hepatobiliary injury in SS- Selp \u2212/\u2212  mice . Mechanistically, we show that blocking P-selectin causes significant enrichment of circulating inflammatory cells however the organ specific recruitment of inflammatory cells was drastically impaired. Remarkably, impairment of organ specific recruitment of inflammatory cells exacerbated cellular senescence and injury in sickle mouse. We found significant enrichment of senescent markers including P21, P16 and phosphor P53 using both western blot and immunohistochemistry. Colocalization analysis confirmed that hepatocytes, cholangiocytes and macrophages were susceptible to senescence. Moreover, we also found impaired iron trafficking in in SS- Selp \u2212/\u2212  mice . Work is currently underway to understand how p-selectin loss promotes liver senescence and impaired iron trafficking in the liver. In summary, our results reveal a significant defect in iron homeostasis and exacerbated senescence in the liver of SS- Selp \u2212/\u2212  mice suggesting that increased liver senescence might impair iron homeostasis which then contribute to hepatobiliary injury in SCD. Thus, the efficacy of P-selectin inhibition in preventing SCD warrants further studies to determine whether long term inhibition of P-selectin would lead to end stage complications.
