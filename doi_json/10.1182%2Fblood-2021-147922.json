    "abstract_text": "Introduction Vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a severe complication of recombinant adenoviral vector vaccines used to prevent COVID-19, likely due to anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) IgG antibodies. The specificity and platelet-activating activity of VITT antibodies strikingly resemble that of antibodies detected in \"autoimmune\" heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), but their features remain poorly characterized. In particular, a better knowledge of these antibodies should help to understand the mechanisms leading to hypercoagulability and the particular thrombotic events observed in VITT, but rarely in typical HIT. We have recently developed a chimeric IgG1 anti-PF4 antibody, 1E12, which strongly mimics \"autoimmune\" HIT antibodies in terms of specificity and cellular effects. Therefore, we assessed whether 1E12 could mimic VITT antibodies. We then evaluated the capability of DG-1E12, a deglycosylated form of 1E12 unable to bind Fc\u03b3R, to inhibit cellular activation induced by VITT antibodies. Methods and Results Using a PF4-sensitized serotonin release assay (PF4-SRA) (Vayne C, New Engl J Med, 2021), we demonstrated that 1E12 (5 and 10 \u03bcg/mL) strongly activated platelets, with a pattern similar to that obtained with human VITT samples (n=7), i.e. in a PF4-dependent manner and without heparin. This platelet activation was inhibited by low heparin concentration (0.5 IU/mL), an effect also observed with VITT samples. Serotonin release induced by 1E12 was also fully inhibited by IV-3, a monoclonal antibody blocking Fc\u03b3RIIa, or by IdeS, a bacterial protease that cleaves IgG and strongly inhibits the binding of IgG antibodies to Fc\u03b3RIIa. This inhibitory effect of IV-3 and IdeS strongly supports that interactions between pathogenic anti-PF4 IgG and Fc\u03b3RIIa play a central role in VITT. Incubation of 1E12 or VITT samples with isolated neutrophils (PMN) and platelets with PF4 (10 \u00b5g/mL) strongly induced DNA release and NETosis, supporting that PMN are involved in the processes leading to thrombosis in VITT. Furthermore, when whole blood from healthy donors incubated with 1E12 or VITT plasma was perfused in capillaries coated with von Willebrand Factor, numerous large platelet/leukocyte aggregates containing fibrin(ogen) were formed. To investigate whether 1E12 and VITT antibodies recognize overlapping epitopes on PF4, we then performed competitive assays with a deglycosylated form of 1E12 (DG-1E12), still able to bind PF4 but not to interact with Fc\u03b3 receptors. In PF4-SRA, pre-incubation of DG-1E12 (50 \u00b5g/mL) dramatically reduced platelet activation induced by VITT antibodies, which was fully abrogated for 9 of the 14 VITT samples tested. Additional experiments using a whole blood PF4-enhanced flow cytometry assay recently designed for VITT diagnosis (Handtke et al, Blood 2021), confirmed that DG-1E12 fully prevented platelet activation induced by VITT antibodies. Moreover, when platelets and neutrophils were pre-incubated with DG-1E12 (100 \u00b5g/mL), NETosis and thus DNA release, nuclear rounding, and DNA decondensation induced by VITT antibodies were completely inhibited. Finally, DG-1E12 (100 \u00b5g/mL) also fully abolished VITT antibody-mediated thrombus formation in whole blood in vitro under vein flow conditions. Comparatively, DG-1E12 did not inhibit ALB6, a murine monoclonal anti-CD9 antibody, which also strongly activates platelets in a Fc\u03b3RIIa-dependent manner. Conclusions Our results show that 1E12 exhibits features similar to those of human VITT antibodies in terms of specificity, affinity and cellular effects, and could therefore be used as a model antibody to study the pathophysiology of VITT. Our data also demonstrate that DG-1E12 prevents blood cell activation and thrombus formation induced by VITT antibodies, likely due to the competitive effect of its Fab fragment on antibody binding to PF4. DG-1E12 may allow the development of a new drug neutralizing the pathogenic effect of autoimmune anti-PF4 antibodies, such as those associated with VITT.
