    "abstract_text": "The bone microenvironment plays a critical role in supporting the growth and survival of myeloma cells and the development of osteolytic bone disease. Signalling through p38 \u03b1 MAPK mediates synthesis of myeloma cell survival factors by stromal cells; whereas, inhibiting p38 \u03b1 MAPK reduces myeloma cell proliferation and inhibits osteoclast formation in vitro. However, it is unclear whether p38 \u03b1 MAPK inhibition will prevent the growth and survival of myeloma cells and the bone disease in vivo. The aim of this study was to determine whether SCIO-469, a selective p38 \u03b1 MAPK inhibitor, would inhibit myeloma growth and prevent the development of bone disease in the 5TMM syngeneic models of myeloma. Treatment of 5TMM cells, in vitro, with SCIO-469 resulted in a clear inhibition of p38 phosphorylation, as assessed by Western blotting and an inhibition up to 35% of stromal cell induced 5T33MM proliferation. Injection of 5T2MM murine myeloma cells into C57Bl/KaLwRij mice resulted in the growth of myeloma in bone and the development of bone disease characterized by increased osteoclast surface (p<0.05), a reduction in cancellous bone (p<0.01) and the presence of osteolytic bone lesions on x-ray (p<0.01). Treatment of 5T2MM-bearing mice with SCIO-469 (150mg/kg in the diet, therapeutical treatment from paraprotein detection) resulted in a 42% decrease in serum paraprotein and prevented development of osteolytic lesions (p<0.01). Injection of 5T33MM cells into C57Bl/KaLwRij mice also resulted in the development of myeloma but not associated bone disease. Treatment of 5T33MM-bearing mice from the time of tumor cell injection with SCIO-469 resulted in a decrease in serum paraprotein (8.8+/\u22121.4g/dl to 0.04+/\u2212 0.03g/dl, p<0.001) and a reduction in the proportion of tumor cells in the bone marrow (67 +/\u2212 8.1% to 1.09 +/\u2212 0.58%, p<0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated an increase in disease-free survival (veh=27.5 days vs 96 days, p<0.001) after treatment of the mice with SCIO-469. These data demonstrate that targeting p38 \u03b1 MAPK with SCIO-469 is associated with an anti-myeloma effect, which indirectly prevents the development of myeloma bone disease.",
