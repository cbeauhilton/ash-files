    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-1 (SATB1) is critical for genome organizer that reprograms chromatin organization and transcription profiles, and associated with tumor growth and metastasis in several cancer types cancer. However, their expression patterns and function values for adult T-cell leukemia (ALT) are still largely unknown. METHODS: Expression of SATB1 in normal and ALT peripheral blood leucocytes (n=50 for normal, n=30 for ALT) were evaluated by RT-qPCR in mRNA level. Expression of protein SATB1 in leukemia cell lines were evaluated by Weston Blot.SATB1-shRNA was constructed in psuper-retro-puro retrovirus vector. Jurkat-SATB1-sh and control stable cell lines were established after virus infection and puromycin selection. Cellular proliferation and invasion of Jurkat-ctr and SATB1 knockdown Jurkat cells were evaluated by CCK-8 kit and transwell matrigel invasion assay, respectively. RESULTS: SATB1 mRNA expression was decreased in ALT (p<0.001) compared with normal peripheral blood leucocytes cells. SATB1 protein expression in Jurkat cell was higher than other leukemia cell lines. SATB1-shRNA was constructed successfully. Weston Blot show Jurkat-SATB1-sh and control stable cell lines were established successfully. Knockdown of SATB1 expression significantly enhanced invasion of Jurkat cell in vitro but no effect in proliferation CONCLUSIONS: Decreased expression of SATB1 in ALT was associated with cell invasion.
