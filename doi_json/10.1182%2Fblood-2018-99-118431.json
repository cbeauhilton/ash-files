    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Tissue Factor Pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is a plasma serine protease inhibitor that modulates the initiation of coagulation by directly binding and inhibiting the Tissue Factor (TF)/Factor VIIa/Factor Xa complex. TFPI is a multi-Kunitz domain protein that directly binds to and inhibits both activated Factor Xa (FXa) and FVIIa. Blocking TFPI can act as a bypass therapy by facilitating hemostasis initiated by tissue factor/FVIIa, thereby, compensating for loss of Factor VIII or Factor IX (in hemophilia A or B). PF-06741086, a fully human antibody engineered to inhibit TFPI, exhibits broad cross reactivity to TFPI from numerous species, including mouse. PF-06741086 is being developed as a potential treatment for bleeding disorders including hemophilia A and hemophilia B with and without inhibitors. aPCC (activated Prothrombin complex concentrates or FEIBA, Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypass Agent) is a bypass agent for to control bleed in Hemophilia patients with inhibitors. Since it is a plasma-derived concentrate containing various prothrombin complex coagulation factors in their enzymatic or zymogen form, it is possible that FEIBA could potentially impact the activity of PF-06741086. AIMS: Here, we directly compare the hemostatic effect of PF-06741086 alone, and in combination with aPCC in Hemophilia A mouse model using severe tail vein transection. METHODS: Male hemophilia A mice were dosed with a single intravenous dose of PF-06741086 (0.5, 1, 2 or 6 mg/kg) 30 minutes prior to a 3mm tail clip, or aPCC (50, 100 or 200 U/kg) was administered 5 minutes before the tail clip. Mice were also treated with a combined dose of 0.5 mg/kg anti-TFPI PF-06741086 and aPCC at 50, 100 or 200 U/kg. Blood was collected for 10 minutes and quantified against a standard curve of hemoglobin as volume blood loss. RESULTS : PF-06741086 demonstrated a dose dependent response in improving hemostasis in Hemophilia A mice after tail clip. PF-06741086 was able to restore hemostasis at 1 mg/kg (49%), and higher doses further improved hemostasis at 2 mg/kg (63%), and 6 mg/kg (78%). aPCC also demonstrated a dose dependent reduction in blood loss and improved hemostasis with all tested doses of 50 U/kg (25%), 100 U/kg (23%) and 200 U/kg (66%). At a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, PF-06741086 did not show any improvement in hemostasis over vehicle control. We used this dose for all combination studies with aPCC. Combined use of low dose PF-06741086 (0.5 mg/kg) and 100 U/kg aPCC shows a trend towards improvement in hemostasis compared to either drug alone. A higher dose of aPCC (200 U/kg) combined with low dose PF-06741086 (0.5 mg/kg) significantly reduces blood loss (86%) in Hemophilia A mice in tail clip model compared to saline, TFPI or aPCC alone used at the same dose of 0.5 mg/kg or 200 U/kg respectively. CONCLUSIONS : Prophylactic administration of PF-06741086 exhibits a dose response and improves hemostasis in an injury model in Hemophilia A mice. The addition of aPCC alone restores hemostasis at 200 U/kg and this effect was enhanced in combination with PF-06741086 in this mouse model. Disclosures Barakat: Pfizer: Employment.
