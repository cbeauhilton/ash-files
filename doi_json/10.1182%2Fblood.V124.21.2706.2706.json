In sickle cell disease (SCD) stroke is common, however accurate quantification of basal cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO 2 ) has not been performed. Early PET studies suggested CMRO 2 was decreased in SCD patients, but these studies lacked data regarding brain volume and gray-white matter fractions; lower CMRO 2 may simply have reflected brain loss from prior stroke. In contrast, NIRS and global resting energy expenditure studies have demonstrated elevated peripheral metabolic rate in SCD patients at baseline, with further increases during painful crisis. In those studies, oxygen consumption was correlated with markers of inflammation, particularly white blood cell count, consistent with metabolic consequences of neutrophil activation. Characterizing CMRO 2 in SCD provides insight into better prevention and management of stroke in the SCD population. Accordingly, we measured CBF and cerebral venous saturation (S v O 2 ) via a recently developed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique: T2 Relaxation Under Spin Tagging (TRUST). Using the Fick Principle, this allowed for quantification of oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and the first quantitative measurements of CMRO 2 in SCD patients. Methods All patients were recruited with informed consent or assent and this study was approved by the CHLA IRB. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, previous stroke, acute chest or pain crisis hospitalization within one month. Fifteen patients with SCD and 12 healthy ethnicity matched controls (CTL) were studied. Arterial oxygen saturation (S a O 2 ) was measured via peripheral pulse oximetery. TRUST was used to measured T2 relaxation of blood within the sagittal sinus; T2 relaxation was converted to S v O 2 using established calibration curves. OEF represented the difference of S a O 2 and S v O 2 . Phase Contrast (PC) of the carotid and vertebral arteries was used to measure global CBF. CMRO 2 was calculated as the product of CBF and OEF. High resolution, 3D, T1 weighted images were used for grey-white segmentation and brain volume calculations using BrainSuite \u00f1 software. Relative grey matter CMRO 2 and white matter CMRO 2 were estimated by assuming that (gm) CMRO 2 was three-fold higher than (wm) CRMRO 2 . Complete blood count, cell free hemoglobin, LDH, and hemoglobin electrophoresis were measured at the study visit. Results Table 1 summarizes the results. To compensate for their chronic anemia, SCD patients had 67% greater CBF than control subjects, producing a normal S v O 2 and OEF. Oxygen delivery also trended higher than for controls leading to higher total CMRO 2 in the SCD patients. CMRO 2 increases remained significant even after correction for differences in grey and white matter volumes. We found no correlation between WBC and CMRO 2 when tested by population. Discussion Our study demonstrates elevated cerebral metabolism in SCD, mirroring increases in global resting energy expenditure and peripheral metabolic rate described by other groups. The etiology of the increased CMRO 2 is unknown but could reflect neuroinflammation or energy demands from chronic injury/repair. Regardless, our observation at least partially explains the increase of CBF beyond predicted by anemia alone. By excluding patients with overt stroke and by correcting for differences in brain volume and composition, our results are the first CMRO 2 measurements in SCD that are unconfounded by brain volume loss. Given the age differences between our study and control populations, we cannot exclude developmental differences in CMRO 2 among patients and controls. However, in general, CMRO 2 increases with age, which would tend to lessen rather than increase the CMRO 2 differences seen in our study. Table 1  . Controls . SCD . p .
