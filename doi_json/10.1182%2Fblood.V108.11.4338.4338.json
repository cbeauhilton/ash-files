    "abstract_text": "Recently, we and others have shown that protein-protein interactions play an important role in the pathogenesis of leukemia, and that the transcription factor C/EBP\u03b1 is a key player in granulopoiesis and leukemogenesis. In the present study, we sought to identify C/EBP\u03b1 interacting proteins. A glutathione-S-transferase-C/EBP\u03b1 fusion protein was used to pull down interacting proteins from U937 nuclear extracts. These proteins were analyzed by 2-D gel electrophoresis, 1-D nano LC and identified by MALDI or MALDI-TOF/TOF. Several novel C/EBP\u03b1 interactors were identified including known proteins like Rb, hnRNP and E2F4. Two novel interactions, one of cell cycle regulator protein MCM5 and the other with the MYST domain histone acetyl transferase TIP60 with C/EBP\u03b1 were further confirmed by using pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. TP60 was able to markedly enhance C/EBP\u03b1 mediated transcription in reporter gene assays, suggesting that TIP60 is a co-activator of C/EBP\u03b1. This co-activator function of TIP60 was dependent on an intact histone acetyl transferase domain and on the C/EBP\u03b1 DNA binding domain. TIP60 was found to be associated with the human C/EBP\u03b1 promoter in-vivo in a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay with a concomitant increase in histone H3 and H4 acetylation. Furthermore, we observed a lower expression of TIP60 mRNA in U937 CD11b \u2212 compared to retinoic acid induced U937 CD11b + cells suggesting that higher TIP60 expression is associated with myeloid differentiation. There was also a marked correlation between the expression levels of TIP60 and C/EBPa in normal bone marrow, chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia samples with t(8;21), inv(16) and t(15;17). This finding further confirms the functional synergism between C/EBP\u03b1 and TIP60 and suggests that TIP60 might be an important player in leukemogenesis."
