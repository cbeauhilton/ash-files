    "abstract_text": "Introduction VMP is a standard of care (SOC) for transplant ineligible NDMM. Daratumumab (D), a human IgG\u03ba anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody with a direct on-tumor and multifaceted immunomodulatory mechanism of action significantly improves PFS and depth of response in combination with SOC in relapsed MM. Treatment-na\u00efve pts may benefit greatly with the addition of D to SOC regimens. Here we report the results from the ALCYONE study, where D is added to VMP in transplant ineligible NDMM. Methods Pts \u226565 years or otherwise ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation were randomized 1:1 to VMP \u00b1 D and stratified by International Staging System (ISS [I, II, III]), region (Europe vs other) and age (<75 vs \u226575 years). All pts received up to a maximum of nine 6-week cycles of VMP. V: 1.3 mg/m 2 SC on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, 32 (Cycle 1) and Days 1, 8, 22, and 29 (Cycles 2-9); M: 9 mg/m 2 PO and P: 60 mg/m 2 PO on Days 1-4 (Cycles 1-9). In the D-VMP arm, D was given at 16 mg/kg IV QW for Cycle 1, Q3W for Cycles 2-9, and Q4W for Cycles 10+ (post VMP-treatment phase) until disease progression. The primary endpoint was PFS. Key secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), rate of very good partial response (VGPR) or better, rate of complete response (CR) or better, minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity rate (10 -5 threshold, Adaptive clonoSEQ \u00ae Assay), overall survival (OS), and safety. Results Of 706 pts randomized (350 D-VMP; 356 VMP), median (range) age was 71 (40-93) years; 29.9% were \u226575 years; 46.3% were male. 74.9% of pts had ECOG scores \u22651, and 19.3%, 42.4%, and 38.4% were ISS stage I, II, and III, respectively. Of 616 pts evaluable for FISH/karyotyping cytogenetic analysis, 84.1% and 15.9% were standard and high risk (positive for del17p, t[14;16], t[4;14]), respectively. At the timepoint of the prespecified analysis after 231 PFS events on 12 June 2017, pts had received a median (range) of 12 (1-24) vs 9 (1-9) treatment cycles for D-VMP vs VMP, respectively. 80% of pts in the D-VMP arm completed 9 treatment cycles of VMP vs 62% of pts in the VMP arm. Median (range) cumulative bortezomib doses were 46.9 (1.3-55.3) mg/m 2 vs 42.2 (2.6-55.0) mg/m 2 for D-VMP vs VMP, respectively. At a median follow-up of 16.5 months, the hazard ratio for PFS (D-VMP vs VMP) was 0.50 (95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.65, P <0.0001), representing a 50% reduction in the risk of progression or death in pts treated with D-VMP ( Figure ). Median PFS was not reached vs 18.1 months for D-VMP vs VMP. The PFS treatment benefit of D-VMP vs VMP was consistent across all pre-specified subgroups, including age \u226575 years, ISS stage III, and high-risk cytogenetics. ORR (90.9% vs 73.9%), \u2265VGPR (71.1% vs 49.7%), \u2265CR (42.6% vs 24.4%) and MRD-negativity rate (22.3% vs 6.2%) were significantly higher for D-VMP vs VMP (all P < 0.0001; Table ). OS data were immature after 93 deaths (45 vs 48 deaths for D-VMP vs VMP). The most common (\u226520%) all-grade treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE; D-VMP/VMP) were neutropenia (49.7%/52.5%), thrombocytopenia (48.8%/53.7%), anemia (28.0%/37.6%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (28.3%/34.2%), upper respiratory tract infection (26.3%/13.8%), diarrhea (23.7%/24.6%), pyrexia (23.1%/20.9%), and nausea (20.8%/21.5%). Most common (\u226510%) grade 3/4 TEAEs (D-VMP/VMP) were neutropenia (39.9%/38.7%), thrombocytopenia (34.4%/37.6%), anemia (15.9%/19.8%), and pneumonia (11.3%/4.0%). Only 1 pt in each arm discontinued treatment due to pneumonia. The rates of grade 3/4 infections were 23.1% vs 14.7% and treatment discontinuations due to infections were 0.9% vs 1.4% for D-VMP vs VMP. D-associated infusion-related reactions (27.7%) mostly were grade 1/2 (grade 3/4, 4.3%/0.6%) and most (92.7%) occurred during the first infusion. Tumor lysis syndrome occurred in <1% of pts in each arm. Second primary malignancy occurred in 2.3% vs 2.5% pts in D-VMP vs VMP. Conclusion The combination of D with VMP in transplant ineligible NDMM pts doubled the PFS (HR 0.50), which was driven by more pts achieving deep responses, including significantly higher \u2265CR rate and tripling of the MRD-negativity rate. No new safety signals were observed when combining D with VMP. Three phase 3 studies have now demonstrated a consistent doubling of PFS and more than threefold increase in MRD-negativity rate when combining D with SOC regimens. These results support the use of a D-based combination, D-VMP, in transplant ineligible NDMM.
