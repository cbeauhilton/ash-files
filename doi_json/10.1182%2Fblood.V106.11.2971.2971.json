    "abstract_text": "It is often questionable as to whether or not therapeutic benefit documented in prospective studies reflects that which is observed in routine use. Four prospective studies have explored the efficacy of alemtuzumab in heavily pretreated B-CLL patients, reporting response rates (RR) between 33% to 55%, and median survival between 13\u201328 months. Here, we report clinical outcomes after therapy with alemtuzumab of 106 consecutive, unselected B-CLL patients treated in 25 centers in Austria. Seventy-two patients were male and 34 female, the median age was 66 years (range, 46\u201388 years). The majority of patients had advanced stage disease, with 58% having Rai stage IV disease. The patients had received a median of 3 prior therapies (range, 1\u201311). Alemtuzumab was administered according to guidelines, but in the majority of cases, dosing was individualized, according to tolerability, side effects, and economic considerations. Thus, the median duration of therapy was 7 weeks (range, 2\u201324 weeks), and median dose was only 390 mg (range, 11\u20131333 mg). Therapeutic response was determined, strictly adhering to the NCI criteria (duration of complete response [CR]/partial response [PR]/stable disease [SD] \u2265 2 months; adequate radiologic studies of all non-palpable manifestation; marrow for CR). CR, PR, and SD were achieved in 5%, 17%, and 34% of patients (RR 22%). Progressive disease occurred in 34%, and responses were not evaluable in 9%, due to early death. In the 59 patients with overall CR/PR/SD, peripheral blood responses were as follows: 63% CR, 25% PR, and 12% SD. Survival times were encouraging and comparable with other studies. The median survival for all patients was 19 months; 15 months for fludarabine-refractory patients (n = 67) and 31 months for fludarabine-sensitive patients (n = 24; P = 0.04). Survival was dependent on response ( P = 0.0001), the number of previous therapy lines (0\u20133 vs >3; P = 0.0001), and the presence of bulky disease ( P = 0.005). Route of administration (IV: 49%; IV to SC 38%; upfront SC 13%) did not influence outcome. Toxicities were within the expected range, with grade 3/4 infections in 37% of patients; grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in 25% and 23% of patients, CMV reactivation in 14% (CMV disease in 3%) of patients, and early death (<2 months after last dose) in 12% of patients. We conclude that in the routine clinical setting, alemtuzumab is a safe and effective treatment with profound prolongation of survival in pretreated B-CLL patients. This retrospective study is an important contribution to continuous, nationwide quality control.",
