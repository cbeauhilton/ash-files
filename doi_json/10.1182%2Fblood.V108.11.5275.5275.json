    "abstract_text": "Objective To evaluate hematopoietic reconstitution, immune reconstitution, infection, incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and other complications between unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation and bone marrow (BM) transplantation. Methods The clinical results in 21 patients receiving a PBSC graft mobilized by granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) from unrelated donors were compared to 32 patients receiving unrelated BM transplants. Results The PBSC graft contained significantly more nucleated cells ( P =0.000), and resulted in a significantly shorter time-to-neutrophil (12.43\u00b13.67 versus 16.16\u00b12.99 days) and platelet engraftment (14.67\u00b16.19 versus 21.23\u00b18.25 days), compared to the BM group ( P =0.000, 0.003, respectively). T cell reconstitution between the two groups differed little after transplantation. The incidences of early-stage infection were 42.86% and 53.13% (not significant [NS]) in the PBSC and BM groups, respectively. Probabilities of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) were 61.90% and 71.88% (NS), of grades III to IV aGVHD 23.81% and 15.63% (NS) and of chronic GVHD 47.06% and 43.48% (NS) in the PBSC and BM groups, respectively. The probabilities of relapse were 6.90% and 12.50% (NS) in the PBSC and BM groups, respectively. The 2-year disease free survival (DFS) rates of the two groups were (50.14\u00b112.00) % and (59.81\u00b18.99) %( NS), respectively. Conclusion G-CSF-mobilized PBSCs engraft rapidly in unrelated donor recipients compared to conventional BM, but T cell reconstitution and the incidence of infection between the two groups differed little. There were no significant differences of the incidence and severity of aGVHD and cGVHD, and 2-year DFS rates between the two groups."
