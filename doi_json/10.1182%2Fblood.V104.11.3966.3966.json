    "abstract_text": "Objective : To study the changes of thrombomodulin(TM) in both plasma and tissue extracts of cancer patients for evaluating its clinical significance. Methods : Plasma TM levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) in both plasma of 188 cancer patients and 24 cancer tissue extracts including their adjacent non-cancer tissues. Results : The plasma TM levels both in cancer patients and in metastasis patients were significantly higher than that in controls [(33.47\u00b114.25)ug/L/(41.68\u00b116.96)ug/L, vs (20.40\u00b17.22)ug/L, P <0.01]. The plasma TM levels in cancer patients after operation decreased obviously than that before operation [(18.45\u00b19.96)ug/L, vs (28.29\u00b111.74)ug/L, P <0.01], whereas, the plasma TM levels in patients with recurrence and metastasis after operation increased obviously [(34.50\u00b112.57)ug/L]. Among the type of cancer, the plasma TM levels in metastasis including lung cancers and gastric cancers and pancreatic cancers were significantly higher than that in non-metastasis respectively, but no significant differences were foundPOST http://www.call4abstracts.com/hem/body.p including gastric cancers and pancreatic cancers and nasopharyngeal cancers and large intestine cancers and laryngeal cancers ( P >0.05). The TM levels in cancer tissue extracts were significantly lower than that in their adjacent non-cancer tissue extracts [(647.71\u00b1317.51)ug/L vs (1455.63\u00b1772.22)ug/L, P <0.01]. On the contrary, the plasma TM levels in these cancers were significantly higher than that in controls. Conclusion : The rise of plasma TM levels in cancer patients was associated with metastasis and diffusion of cancers. The TM levels can be served as a sensitive index for judging progression and metastasis of cancers.",
