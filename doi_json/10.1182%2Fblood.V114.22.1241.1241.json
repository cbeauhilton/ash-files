    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1241 Poster Board I-263 Background and Significance Monoclonal B lymphocytosis (MBL) is a hematologic syndrome characterized by accumulations of clonal B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. Most MBL have a CLL-like immunophenotype, though other, less common phenotypes are observed. Although some MBL, particularly those with MBL cell counts >1.9 \u00d7 10 9 / L, progress to CLL, \u201clow count\u201d MBL (<0.2 \u00d7 10 9 MBL / \u03bcL) have little potential to progress to MBL and may have different biologic characteristics from MBL with lymphocytosis or Rai Stage 0 CLL. Our hypothesis was that detailed characterization of family-associated MBL may also provide biologic insights into the pathogenesis of CLL. Methods Individuals with MBL were identified by flow cytometry screening of fresh and cyropreserved peripheral blood from unaffected members of CLL kindreds ascertained by Genetic Epidemiology of CLL Consortium (GEC) sites. We defined MBL as populations of CD5 + , CD19 + , CD20 lo , CD23 + B cells that comprised at least 0.02% of the PBMC and did not exceed 5.0 \u00d7 10 9 MBL cells / L. Flow cytometry was used to determine the surface immunophenotype including prognostic parameters of CD38, intracellular ZAP-70, immunoglobulin isotype, CD49d, and the ratio of CD69:71. mRNA and genomic DNA from single MBL cells isolated by flow cytometric sorting were analyzed using PCR to determine immunoglobulin heavy and light chain sequences (IGVH status). MBL cells were sorted in bulk for FISH determination of genetic loci associated with clinical CLL. Results Fifty-four unaffected family members were found to have MBL, of these 48 (89%) showed a typical CLL immunophenotype (CLL-like MBL). We observed significant variability in the size of the MBL clone as a percentage of the CD19 + B cell compartment (mean 30%, median 16%; range 2% - 97%). CD38 positive (defined as CD38 surface expression in \u2265 30% of MBL cells) was observed in 6 of 38 (16%) subjects tested. ZAP-70 positive (defined as intracellular expression in \u2265 20% of MBL cells) was expressed in 5 of 28 (18%) participants. CD49d positive (defined as surface expression in \u2265 45% of MBL cells) was observed in 4 of 17 (24%) subjects. The ratio of surface expression of CD69:CD71, a measure of cellular activation that also correlates with an unmutated IGVH, was \u22652.0 in 3 of 34 (9%) subjects tested. Among 36 subjects tested, 9 (25%) MBL expressed both surface IgD and IgM (defined as surface expression \u2265 40% for both IgM and IgD), 12 (33%) expressed IgD only, 2 (6%) expressed IgM only, and 13 did not express IgD or IgM (36%). Analysis of IGVH status has been completed in 10 individuals. Both immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGVH) region mutated (n = 14) and unmutated (n = 5) sequences were observed. Six of 10 individuals had 2 or more unrelated MBL clones (range 2 - 4), including two individuals with both unmutated and mutated clones. Among the 19 MBL clones identified in these 8 subjects, V H 3 or V H 4 rearrangements were observed in all MBL clones. The most commonly rearranged IGVH genes were 3-07 (3 MBL clones), 3-15 (3), and 4-34 (3). No V H 1 family gene rearrangements were observed. MBL cells were bulk sorted for FISH from 14 subjects. Mono or biallelic deletion of 13q14.3 was observed in 9 subjects, 4 were normal, and one showed trisomy 12. Conclusions Our data affirms that CLL-like MBL are commonly observed among the unaffected family members from CLL kindreds. We found that family associated MBL clones (most of which were small clones) express ZAP-70, CD38, and CD49d at an apparently lower frequency than observed in CLL. Unlike in CLL, the surface immunoglobulin isotype showed co-expression of IgM and IgD in only one third of cases. Moreover, small MBL clones are commonly oligoclonal and predominantly express mutated IGVH genes with an IGVH usage that also appears different from CLL. Taken together, these findings suggest that small MBL clones, though phenotypically similar to CLL, have important biologic differences from CLL that may explain the limited potential of these clones to progress to CLL. The clinical outcome of these MBL clones in relation to our baseline prognostic characterization will be of interest. In addition the further investigation of family associated MBL is being conducted and may clarify the genetics and immunobiology of familial CLL.
