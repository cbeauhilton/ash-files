    "abstract_text": "Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) post-autologous stem cell transplantation is an independent predictor for survival in Hodgkin\u2019s Disease (HD). Lymphopenia at diagnosis is associated with worse prognosis in patients with newly diagnosed HD. The role of ALC recovery during standard chemotherapy for HD is unknown. We analyzed all patients managed for HD at the Mayo Clinic from 1986 to 2003. Of the 141 consecutive patients, two patients were excluded due to missing ALC data. Of the 139 patients, 63 patients were females and 76 males. The median age of patients at diagnosis was 31 years (range 6\u201375 years). 118 (85%) patients presented with nodular sclerosis HD, 10 (7%) with mixed cellularity, 2 (1%) with lymphocyte predominance, 1(1%) with lymphocyte depletion, 4 (3%) with lymphocyte predominant (nodular variant), and 4 (3%) unclassified. Frontline chemotherapy included ABVD (N = 79), MOPP-ABV (N = 47), COPP-ABV (N = 8), BEACOPP (N = 3), and Stanford V (N =2). The median number of cycles was 6 (range: 2\u201310). The median follow-up for the cohort was 62 months (range: 4\u2013221 months). The ALC recovery was analyzed during the first 4 cycles as 90% of the patients received at least 4 cycles of therapy. Patients with an ALC \u2265 1.3 x 10 9 /l at any time point within the first four cycles of chemotherapy (N = 93) demonstrated improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to patients with an ALC < 1.3 x 10 9 /L at all time points within the first four cycles of chemotherapy (N =46) (10 years OS and PFS: 91% vs 51%, p < 0.0001; 85% vs 52%, p < 0.0001, respectively). Both groups were balanced for the Hasenclever Index: albumin < 4g/dl (p = 0.1), hemoglobin < 10.5 g/dl (p = 0.46), male gender (p =0.21), age \u2265 45 years (p = 0.06), stage IV disease (p = 0.68), leukocytosis \u2265 15 x 10 9 /L (p = 0.58), and lymphopenia < 600 cell/ml (p = 0.211). Multivariate analysis demonstrated ALC recovery to be independent predictor of OS and PFS when compared to the Hasenclever index. These data suggest a critical role of lymphocyte (immune) recovery during standard chemotherapy in HD.",
