    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: AML risk classification is based on genetics (cytogenetics and molecular features) and more recently also on minimal residual disease (MRD) after chemotherapy. These two aspects allow predicting relapse and supporting or not the most anti-leukemia treatment that remains allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). We prospectively investigated the combined use of the two predictive markers to allocate post-remission therapy with or without HCT. Objectives of the study were testing: a) if this approach was feasible in a multicenter setting; b) the proportion of patients who were allocated to an allogeneic HCT and finally received the procedure; c) the final distribution into the risk categories and their outcome; d) to analyze the outcome of patients with favorable or intermediate genetics moved to the high risk category because of positive MRD. METHODS: Adult patients with primary AML treated at 15 academic hospitals were included between February 2012 and December 2018. Induction chemotherapy consisted of idarubicin 12 mg/m 2 days 1-2-3 and cytarabine 200 mg/m 2 days 1 to 7. Consolidation courses were high-dose cytarabine (3 g/m 2 or 1.5 g/m 2 if \u226560 y/o). The number of consolidation courses was based on genetic risk: 3 in favorable genetics category (FGC) (CBF, NPM1mut/FLT3-ITDwild or ratio0.1%) and/or quantitative PCR of the specific transcripts (RUNX1/RUNX1T1, CBF\u03b2/MYH11 and NPM1). RESULTS: Seven hundred forty-five patients (median age: 55, range18-70 y/o, 51% male) were enrolled. Cytogenetics according the revised MRC classification in 707 informative cases was: CBF AML 12%, intermediate 65% (75% of them normal karyotype), and adverse 23%. FLT3-ITD was detected in 28% of patients with intermediate risk cytogenetics and NPM1 mutation in the same group was present in the 48%. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 81% (n=603) of patients, 82% and 80% in patients up to and above 60 yrs, respectively. Induction death occurred in 9% of patients, 7% and 11% the two age groups, and 10% of patients had refractory leukemia; 542 (90%) of the 603 CR patients completed the consolidation phase and were risk allocated taking into account genetics and MRD. The remaining CR patients were not allocated because of early relapse (n=22), death in CR (n=5), severe toxicity (n=22) or others (n=12). After risk allocation, 208 (38%) patients were in the genetics-MRD combined favorable group (CFG), 103 (19%) in combined intermediate group (CIG) and 231 (43%) in the combined adverse group (CAG). In the latter, 185 (80%) of patients received an allogeneic HCT in first CR. Fifty-seven patients (11%) moved from the genetically FGC or IGC to the CAG because of high MRD at the end of consolidations. Median follow-up in survivors was 25 months. Overall 4-years survival (OS) of the whole series is 48\u00b12%; event-free survival (EFS) is 77+3% in the CFG group, 45+6% in the CIG and 34+4% in the CAG (p<0.001) due to difference in the cumulative relapse incidence (19%, 38% and 45%, respectively, p<0.001 ). In the 57 patients who were MRD positive at the end of consolidation (FGC and IGC) had an OS of 53\u00b18% and EFS of 45\u00b17% at 4 years. CONCLUSION Risk adapted therapy for primary AML based on genetics and MRD is feasible in a cooperative group setting. The proportion of CR was high (>80%) even in patients older than 60 y/o. MRD assessment at the end of consolidation moved 57 patients with favorable or intermediate genetics to the CAG. Avoiding HCT in first CR in the FGC patients associated to EFS above 75% at 4 years. Allogeneic transplantation feasibility was 80% when this was the intended treatment because of adverse genetics and/or MRD positivity. Risk assessment based on genetics and MRD continues separating three groups of patients with different outcomes. Since relapses remain frequent when adverse AML features are present, further approaches after transplantation, such as targeted agents and immune therapies deserve investigation.
