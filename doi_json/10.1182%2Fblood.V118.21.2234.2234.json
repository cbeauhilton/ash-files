    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2234 Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) is extensively glycosylated with both N- and O-linked carbohydrates. Moreover, these complex glycan structures influence VWF functional properties, including susceptibility to ADAMTS13 proteolysis, and plasma clearance. The molecular mechanisms through which VWF glycosylation (including ABO blood group antigens) act to influence VWF physiology remains unexplained. However, recent data suggest that VWF circulates in normal plasma bound to various carbohydrate-binding proteins, including specific members of the galectin family. In addition, galectin-3 binding has been reported to influence VWF cleavage by ADAMTS13. In this context, we sought to elucidate the role of specific VWF glycan determinants in modulating galectin interaction. VWF was purified from human plasma (pdVWF) by cryoprecipitation and gel filtration. VWF glycosylation was then modified using exoglycosidases and quantified by specific lectin ELISAs. Blood group specific VWF was also purified from pooled group AB, O, or Bombay plasmas. Galectins-1 and -3 were transiently expressed in competent E-coli cells with an N-terminal histidine tag, and purified by nickel chromatography. Finally, binding interactions were characterized via modified immunosorbant assay. In keeping with the previous report of Lenting et al , human pdVWF bound to both galectin-1 and galectin-3 in a dose-dependent manner. Enzymatic desialylation of pdVWF with \u03b12-3,6,8,9 neuraminidase (Neu-VWF) markedly enhanced binding to galectin-1 (231\u00b16%, p <0.0001). Similarly, removal of terminal sialic acid also increased binding to galectin-3, albeit to a lesser extent (136\u00b16%, p<0.05). To further define the role of VWF glycans in regulating galectin binding, pdVWF was exposed to sequential neuraminidase and galactosidase digestions to remove terminal sialic acid and sub-terminal galactose residues (NeuGal-VWF). In contrast to the enhanced binding of Neu-VWF, binding of NeuGal-VWF to both galectin -1 and -3 was significantly reduced (51\u00b15% and 52\u00b16% compared to pdVWF; p <0.005). Cumulatively these findings suggest that loss of capping sialic acid and exposure of sub-terminal galactose critically regulates VWF-galectin binding. Treatment with PNGase F to completely remove N-linked carbohydrate structures (PNG-VWF) markedly decreased binding to galectin -1 and -3 (13\u00b11% and 57\u00b12%, p<0.001). Moreover, combined PNGase F and O-glycosidase digestions further attenuated galectin-3 binding (21\u00b11%, p<0.001), suggesting that both the N- and O-linked glycans are involved in mediating the VWF-galectin interaction. ABO(H) blood group antigens are expressed on both the N-linked and O-linked glycans of human VWF. Moreover, ABO(H) determinants influence VWF susceptibility to ADAMTS13 proteolysis and plasma VWF half-life, through unknown mechanisms. Purified VWF from normal group AB individuals bound to both galectin-1 and galectin-3 significantly better than group O VWF (146\u00b18% and 483\u00b119%; p<0.01). Conversely, no significant difference in binding was observed between Group O and Bombay VWF. Consequently, although terminal A (GalNAc) and B (Gal) sugar moieties promote galectin binding, expression of terminal \u03b11\u20132 fucose residues is not important. The glycosylation profile of platelet-VWF differs from that of pdVWF. In particular, platelet-VWF expresses reduced levels of both capping sialic acid and sub-terminal galactose residues (\u223c50%), and lacks AB blood group antigens. To characterize the effects of this differential sugar expression on galectin binding, platelet-derived VWF was isolated and purified (platelet freeze-thawing followed by immuno-affinity chromatography with monoclonal CLB-Rag20). In keeping with the reduction in Gal and AB blood group antigen expression, platelet VWF bound less well to galectin-1 and galectin-3 (72\u00b16% and 67\u00b17% versus pdVWF; p<0.05). These novel data demonstrate that both the N- and O-linked oligosaccharide structures of VWF are involved in mediating galectin binding. In particular, expression of terminal AB blood group antigens, and expression of sub-terminal galactose moieties following loss of capping sialic acid, both markedly enhance galectin binding affinity. Further studies will be required to define how galectin binding is involved in mediating the functional consequences of variation in VWF glycans.
