    "abstract_text": "Chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, angiogenesis and extramedullary hematopoiesis. No specific genetic defect underlying the disease has been identified so far. The spectrum of cytogenetic abnormalities in CIMF includes del (13q), del (20q) and partial trisomy 1q as well as abnormalities of chromosomes 1, 7 and 9. Hypermethylation of CpG islands within gene promoter regions is associated with transcriptional inactivation and represents an important mechanism of gene silencing in the pathogenesis of hematopoietic malignancies. This epigenetic phenomenon acts as an alternative to mutations and deletions to disrupt tumor suppressor gene function in cancerogenesis. In order to investigate the role of DNA methylation changes in the pathogenesis of CIMF, we have analyzed the methylation status of the promoter-associated CpG islands of 13 well-characterized tumor suppressor genes by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in peripheral blood cells from 20 adult patients with CIMF. The frequency of aberrant methylation among the patient samples was 25.0 % (5/20) for SOCS-1 and 5.0 % (1/20) for E-cadherin, MGMT, p73 as well as TIMP-2. There was no hypermethylation of p15, p16, RARbeta, DAP kinase 1, SOCS-3, hMLH1, TIMP-3 and RASSF1A. We detected at least one hypermethylated gene promoter region in 35.0 % (7/20) of the primary patient samples. Our data indicate that hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is a common event in CIMF. Epigenetic modification of genes regulating growth factor signaling, cell adhesion and DNA repair may, in addition to genetic aberrations, contribute to the malignant phenotype in CIMF. The exploration of our growing knowledge about epigenetic aberrations in tumorigenesis may help develop novel strategies in diagnosis and treatment of CIMF for the future."
