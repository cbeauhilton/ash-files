    "abstract_text": "Abstract 110 [ Background ] Despite the excellent efficacy of imatinib for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), trough imatinib plasma levels can vary widely among patients. This may be due, in part, to inter-individual variation in imatinib metabolism and drug transport efficacy. To investigate the role of genetic variation in the pharmacokinetics of imatinib, we analyzed common single nucleotide polymorphisms within important imatinib pathway genes including ABCG2 ( BCRP ), ABCB1 ( MDR1 ), ABCC2 ( MRP2 ), CYP3A5 , and SLC22A1 ( OCT1 ) in 67 CML patients treated with imatinib. In addition, trough imatinib plasma levels were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. [ Results ] Distinct imatinib pharmacokinetics were identified in association with ABCG2 c.421C>A (p.Q141K; rs2231142 ) genotype. Specifically, the presence of the variant c.421A allele was significantly (p=0.024) associated with higher imatinib concentrations [median Cmin/Dose 2.70 (range: 1.50-8.30) ng/ml/mg; n =25] compared to patients with the wild-type ABCG2 (c.421C/C) genotype [median Cmin/Dose 2.27 (range: 0.37-5.30) ng/ml/mg; n =42]. ABCG2 is an efflux transporter for many xenobiotics, including imatinib, and is expressed at high levels in the human liver. Previous studies indicate that c.421A causes a 40% reduction in imatinib transport in vitro when compared to the wild-type genotype. Our data suggest that CML patients with ABCG2 c.421A allele may have deficient ABCG2 activity in vivo , resulting in reduced hepatic excretion of imatinib. Of note, although less common among Africans and individuals of European decent, the ABCG2 c.421C>A allele occurs at a high frequency in the Japanese (0.311) and Han Chinese (0.289) populations. [ Conclusion ] The association of ABCG2 c.421C>A with imatinib pharmacokinetics may explain why some Japanese CML patients administered less than 400 mg/day of imatinib have clinically sufficient trough imatinib plasma levels. Prospective studies are warranted to confirm the association between ABCG2 genotype and imatinib pharmacokinetics in large patient populations.
