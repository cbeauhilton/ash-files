    "abstract_text": "Background: Relapse from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is one of the most common causes of pediatric cancer-related death. Early relapse of ALL is associated with recurrent mutations of histone methyltransferase NSD2 (nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 2), which is specific for H3K36me2, suggesting a link to therapy resistance or other mechanisms underlying relapse such as central neural system (CNS) infiltration. NSD2 p.E1099K affects gene expression through disturbing the balance of H3K36me2/H3K27me3. Using CRISPR/Cas9-edited isogenic ALL cell lines and PDX cells, we found that NSD2 p.E1099K drives oncogenic programming, CNS infiltration and glucocorticoid (GC) resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the relapse of this subtype of ALL are still under investigation. Aim: To elucidate the epigenetic landscape underlying the mechanism of the relapse of pediatric ALL with NSD2 mutation. Methods: We performed in vivo experiments to observe tumor burden, leukemia cell infiltration and survival of the NOD/SCID mice injected with a NSD2 p.E1099K mutation knock-out SEM cell line and knock-in CEM cell line. We determined transcriptome (RNA-Seq), chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq) in isogenic RCH-ACV, SEM, RPMI-8402 and CEM cell lines, transcription factor binding and histone modification (ChIP-Seq) and 3D organization (Hi-C) in RCH-ACV cells. Finally, we integrated analysis of RNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq, ChIP-Seq and Hi-C to comprehensively disclose the epigenetic landscape in ALL with NSD2 mutation. Results: NOD/SCID mice xenografted with NSD2 mutant cells developed high tumor burden and infiltration to spleen, liver and brain while the mice injected with WT cells accumulated significant less tumor cells and had extended survival. RNA-Seq analysis showed that reversion of NSD2 mutation to WT caused more genes downregulated while insertion of NSD2 mutation to WT cells led to more genes upregulated (Mutant vs WT: RCH-ACV 838 vs 494, SEM 1567 vs 1158, RPMI-8402 1922 vs 1745, CEM 1809 vs 1031). 50 upregulated genes and 3 downregulated genes were in common in B-ALL and T-ALL with NSD2 mutation. Most of the upregulated genes correlated with neural development and adhesion which might contribute to CNS infiltration (e.g., NCAM1 and NEO1) . A few genes were associated with GC resistance such as decreased NR3C1 and increased NR3C2 . Accordingly, ATAC-Seq showed that NSD2 mutant cells had more open chromatin peaks than those of WT (RCH-ACV 4853 vs 3212, SEM 10052 vs 7595, RPMI-8402 20392 vs 12133, CEM 10155 vs 6437). ChIP-Seq revealed general large gains of H3K36me2 in intergenic regions in NSD2 mutant cells. Importantly, genes upregulated with NSD2 mutation (e.g., NCAM1 and NEO1 ) lost H3K27me3 at promoters but gained H3K36me2 at promoters and whole gene bodies, accompanied with increased H3K27ac at enhancers. Conversely, a small subset of genes gained H3K27me3 and lost H3K36me2 in their promoters. Concentrated H3K36me2 in gene bodies diffused and broadened was less prominent and H3K27me3 accumulation became dominant. This for example was associated with repression of NR3C1 to drive GC resistance of NSD2 mutant cells. Genes upregulated in NSD2 mutant cells were enriched for binding sites for lymphoid transcriptional activators such as EBF1 and IRF2. The promoters of the downregulated genes had motifs for transcription factors poorly expressed in lymphoid cells and were enriched for binding sites for the BCL6 transcriptional repressor. Hi-C analysis revealed 430 topologically associated domains (TADs) with increased loop interactions while 136 TADs with decreased interactions were in NSD2 mutant cells compared to WT cells. Overall, 491 regions switched from compartment A to B and 444 regions switched from B to A in NSD2 mutant cells compared to WT cells. Compartment switching from inactive B to active A correlated with upregulated gene expression levels while the reverse was true for switching from A to B. Increased intra-TAD interactions were linked to upregulated genes while decreased intra-TAD interactions were linked to downregulated genes. Conclusions: The NSD2 mutation led to increased tumor burden, CNS infiltration and glucocorticoid resistance due to dysregulation of epigenetic patterns and 3D chromatin architecture, indicating mechanisms underlying the relapse of pediatric ALL and potential therapeutic targets in ALL with NSD2 mutation.
