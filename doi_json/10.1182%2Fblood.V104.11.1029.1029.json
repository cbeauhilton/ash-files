    "abstract_text": "Trauma is the leading cause of death in the younger population in the United States, frequently from the development of hemorrhagic shock. Controversy exists over the type of volume resuscitation to be used (dilutions ranging up to 66%) in hemorrhagic shock for restoring hemodynamic stability. Trauma results in massive exposure of tissue factor to the circulation and explosive amounts of thrombin being generated. We studied the effect of various resuscitative formulas to blood coagulation, specifically thrombin generation and fibrin formation, in a controlled setting using corn trypsin inhibited whole blood initiated with a 5pM stimulus of tissue factor. Thrombin generation measured as its complex with antithrombin III (TAT) was evaluated periodically over a time course of 20 min. Fibrin clots were collected and weighed. We investigated four diluents (0.9% NaCl (NS), lactated Ringer\u2019s solution (LR), 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) and 3% NaCl (HS)) each at a 0,10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60% blood dilution. At a 10% dilution TAT generation was in the order of LR (\u22124%) < HES (\u22128%)< NS and HS (\u221212%). Diluting by 20% resulted in further decreases of TAT formation. The fibrin clot mass decreased dramatically with a 20% dilution for NS (\u221242%) and HES (\u221230%). Conversely, HS produced no change in fibrin mass but effected the largest change in thrombin generation rate (\u221256%). At a 50% dilution, comparable thrombin generation profiles were obtained for LR, HES and NS (~35% decrease). However, the fibrin masses decreased by 27% with LR, 46% with NS and 74% with HES. No clot formation or thrombin generation was seen with HS at > 20% dilution. This in vitro study shows that: 1) LR has the least effect on thrombin generation and gave higher than anticipated clot weights; 2) HES reduced the fibrin clot mass at higher dilutions; 3) HS abolishes coagulation after a 20% dilution. Overall, both the extent and nature of hemodilution cause profound alterations in the hemostatic mechanism.",
