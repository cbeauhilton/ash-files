    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2677 Poster Board II-653 There are clear differences in the response of umbilical cord blood (UCB) T-cells with regards to improved immune tolerance after allogeneic stem cell transplant and lower incidence of acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) which have not been determined at a cellular level. Activated, UCB CD4 + T-cells express less TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 then their adult complement. At the protein level, NFAT1, a transcription factor known to regulate the expression of FoxP3, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 is attenuated in resting UCB CD4 + T-cells. In addition, activated NFAT1 temporal response to stimulation is delayed by \u223c6 hours. However our analysis by gene array did not see any attenuation of FoxP3 mRNA compared to normal nai\u0308ve adult peripherial CD4 + /CD45RA + T-cells. The absence of a key transcription factor activity having little or no effect on subsequent downstream gene expression is normally a strong indicator of compensatory regulatory factor(s). Previous observation demonstrated that the transcription factor BACH2 plays a compensatory regulatory role in the up-regulation of IL-2 in UCB CD4 + /CD45RA + T-cells. Studies of the effect of BACH2 inhibition on FoxP3 expression in UCB CD4 + /CD45RA + T-cells were conducted. Loss of BACH2 expression correlated with the loss of FoxP3 mRNA and protein expression in transient siRNA knockdown experiments as observed by qRT-PCR, and validated by Western Blot. Using cross-linking chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we show that BACH2 binds to the proximal promoter and within intron 1 of FoxP3 gene in nai\u0308ve UCB CD4 + /CD45RA + T-cells and within the intron 1 of adult CD4 + /CD45RA + T-cells. This report summarizes studies demonstrating a functional role for BACH2 in UCB CD4 + /CD45RA + T-cells. Transient knockdown of BACH2 by siRNA results in decreased FoxP3 expression at both at mRNA and protein level prior to CD3/CD28 stimulation. There were several putative BACH2 DNA binds sites both associated and unassociated with NFAT1 sites. ChIP analysis demonstrated that BACH2 co-precipitated with 2 separate sites surrounding exon 1 of the FoxP3 gene in unstimulated UCB CD4 + /CD45RA + T-cells, but with only one site in unstimulated AB CD4 + /CD45RA + T-cells. In addition, the bZip protein sMafK was observed co-immunoprecipitated with the same DNA regions in UCB and AB CD4 + /CD45RA + T-cells. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
