    "abstract_text": "Introduction: CD20-TCB (RG6026) is a novel T-cell-engaging bispecific (TCB) antibody with a '2:1' molecular format that comprises two fragment antigen binding regions that bind CD20 (on the surface of B cells) and one that binds CD3 (on the surface of T cells). CD20-TCB offers the potential for increased tumor antigen avidity, rapid T-cell activation, and enhanced tumor cell killing versus other bispecific formats. The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers, and antitumor activity of CD20-TCB are currently being investigated in a multicenter Phase I dose-escalation trial (NP30179; NCT03075696). We recently presented preliminary clinical data demonstrating promising clinical activity in relapsed or refractory (R/R) non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients with indolent or aggressive disease (Dickinson et al. ICML 2019). Here, we present preliminary blood and tissue biomarker analyses to explore modes of action, support optimal biological dose selection, and identify potential outcome predictors. Methods: For biomarker analyses, we performed immune profiling of peripheral blood by flow cytometry, analyzed plasma cytokine levels by ELISA, and characterized baseline and on-treatment tumor biopsies by immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence assays and RNA sequencing. Biomarker data were obtained from 122 patients dosed with 0.005-25mg CD20-TCB. Results: CD20-TCB infusion led to a rapid and transient reduction in T cells in the peripheral circulation (T-cell margination) in all patients. T-cell margination reached nadir 6 hours after the first CD20-TCB infusion, and showed a strong association with CD20-TCB dose and receptor occupancy (RO%; as determined by Djebli et al. ASH 2019). Interestingly, rebound of T cells 160 hours after the first CD20-TCB infusion was associated with response to treatment. Responding patients showed long-term T-cell activation after the first infusion of CD20-TCB at doses from 0.6mg and above. T-cell activation was demonstrated by 2-4-fold elevation of T-cell activation markers such as Ki67, HLA-DR, PD-1, ICOS, OX40, and 4-1BB, which was sustained up to Cycle 5 (105 days). Analysis of paired pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsies (n=6) obtained before and 2-3 weeks after the first dose of CD20-TCB showed evidence of T-cell-mediated tumor cell killing. Analysis of archival and pre-treatment tumor biopsies (n=80) revealed that clinical responses were achieved irrespective of the amount of tumor T-cell infiltration at baseline. In contrast, preliminary baseline bulk tumor RNA sequencing data (n=46) showed upregulation of gene signatures associated with cell proliferation/Myc and T-cell subsets (effector vs exhausted-like) in non-responding patients. Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrated the mode of action of CD20-TCB, a novel bispecific antibody with promising clinical activity in R/R NHL. We also demonstrated that biomarker data on T-cell activation can support dose finding in conjunction with pharmacokinetics. Additional analysis is ongoing to evaluate response predictors and better characterize the population that will benefit most from T-cell mediated therapies.

OffLabel Disclosure: CD20-TCB (also known as RG6026, RO7082859) is a full-length, fully humanized, immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody with two fragment antigen binding (Fab) regions that bind to CD20 (on the surface of B cells) and one that binds to CD3 (on the surface of T cells) (2:1 format). The 2:1 molecular format of CD20-TCB, which incorporates bivalent binding to CD20 on B cells and monovalent binding to CD3 on T cells, redirects endogenous non-specific T cells to engage and eliminate malignant B cells. CD20-TCB is an investigational agent."
