    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-35 Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are responsible for sustaining and propagating malignant disease and, therefore, are promising targets for therapy. The current paradigm for LSC frequency, maturation and hierarchical organization is primarily based on transplantation studies in xenograft mouse models. To circumvent potential limitations of this experimental approach, investigators have recently employed syngeneic mouse models to study LSCs. In a mouse model of AML initiated by MLL oncogenes, which are associated with the FAB-M4 or M5 subtypes of human AML, LSCs are remarkably frequent, accounting for up to one-quarter of malignant myeloid cells at late-stage disease. Even in this syngeneic setting, however, transplant assays alone markedly underestimate LSC frequency due to poor engraftment efficiency. LSCs are organized in a phenotypic and functional hierarchy, and express myeloid lineage-specific antigens, placing them downstream of the known hematopoietic progenitor compartments. Thus, LSCs in this model are not synonymous with normal upstream progenitors that are targeted for leukemia initiation, but rather constitute myeloid lineage cells that have acquired an aberrant self-renewal program as well as other biologic features of hematopoietic stem cells. Gene expression profiling confirms the downstream myeloid character of LSCs in this model, and further demonstrates the aberrant expression of a stem cell associated transcriptional subprogram. However, LSC maintenance in the self-renewing compartment of AML employs a global transcriptional program more akin to embryonic rather than adult stem cells. Expression of LSC maintenance program genes is enriched in poor prognosis human malignancies, suggesting that the frequency of aberrantly self-renewing progenitor-like cancer stem cells may be linked to prognosis in human cancer. Consistent with this possibility, LSC frequencies in different syngeneic models of Hox-associated AML can vary over three orders of magnitude, depending on the particular initiating oncogene and expression levels of Hox pathway co-regulators, and correlate with leukemia biology. Studies in a human cord blood cell transduction/transplantation model of AML further support the downstream character of MLL LSCs. These findings prompt a revision of the current paradigm that AML leukemia stem cells are always rare and solely located within the most immature bone marrow progenitor compartments. The fact that LSCs can be more analogous to precursors and employ ESC-like genetic programs for their maintenance, may allow for their selective therapeutic targeting that spares HSCs required for hematopoiesis.
