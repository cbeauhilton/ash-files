    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1064 Poster Board I-86 Introduction: Decreased fibrinolysis has been reported in venous thrombosis. Thrombus degradation depends on its structure: thicker fibrin fibers are permeable to blood flow and highly susceptible to fibrinolytic enzymes, while thinner fibers are poorly permeable to flow and are resistant to fibrinolysis. Thrombin concentration present at the time of gelation profoundly influences fibrin clot structure: decrease in thrombin generation leads to the formation of thick fibrin fibers and to a decrease in activation of thrombin-activated fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI). Rivaroxaban, an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, is in late stage clinical development for the prevention and treatment of venous and arterial thrombosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of Rivaroxaban on whole blood (WB) clot structure and degradability by t-PA. Compared to plasma clots, WB clots might better represent the in vivo formed thrombi. Methods: 1- Clots were formed by adding to WB or to corresponding plasma, low concentration of tissue factor and calcium in the presence or absence of Rivaroxaban at therapeutic concentrations (0.15 and 0.25 \u03bcg/ml). 2- Clot permeability was calculated by measuring the flow rate of liquid through the clot. It was expressed as Darcy constant. 3- Clot degradability was evaluated by D dimers generation during clot perfusion with plasminogen and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Results: 1- In the absence of Rivaroxaban, WB clots had a lower porosity than that of corresponding plasma clots: Darcy constant of WB clots was 3.1 \u2013fold lower than that of plasma clots. This decreased porosity of WB clots leads to thrombolysis resistance by preventing access of fibrinolytic enzymes to fibrin network: D dimers generation in t-PA-perfused clots for 60 min was 38 -fold lower in WB clots compared to plasma clots. 2- Rivaroxaban increased the permeation rate of WB clots and thrombolysis by t-PA: the addition of Rivaroxaban at 0.15 \u03bcg/ml in WB (corresponding in fact to plasma concentration of 0.25 \u03bcg/ml), increased the Darcy constant by 5.5 \u2013fold and the clot degradability in 60 min by 108 -fold. These effects of Rivaroxaban were higher in WB clots than in corresponding plasma clots, as Rivaroxaban at 0.25 \u03bcg/ml in plasma clots increased the Darcy constant by 2.5-fold and clot degradation by 9.6-fold. In the presence of Rivaroxaban, the Darcy constant and the degradability of WB clots and of plasma clots were nearly identical. 3- To explain the greater efficacy of Rivaroxaban on WB permeation constants and thrombolysis in comparison to plasma clots a) we tested the possibility for Rivaroxaban to reduce the entrapment of red blood cells (RBC) into the network of fibrin as RBC can be responsible for fibrin pore occlusion. This possibility was excluded since Rivaroxaban had no effect on clot permeation rate in clots formed by clotting purified fibrinogen with thrombin in the presence or in the absence of RBC (condition in which there is no generation of thrombin): RBC induced a 2.5 times decrease in permeation rate due to entrapment of RBC into fibrin network, regardless of presence or absence of Rivaroxaban. b) we analyzed the effect of RBC on thrombin generation and its modification by Rivaroxaban: the addition of 0.1 ml RBC diluted \u00bd to 0,2 ml plasma increased the thrombin generation (540 % of control without RBC). This is probably due to exposure of phosphatidyl serine at surface of RBC during thrombin generation. The increase in thrombin generation by RBC was reduced to 140 % in presence of Rivaroxaban at 0.15 \u03bcg/ml. This is explained by Rivaroxaban's inhibition of factor Xa bound to cells. Conclusion: Thrombin generation was greater in WB than in plasma, leading to a lower porosity and degradability of WB clots as compared to plasma clots. Rivaroxaban, by decreasing thrombin generation, increased clot permeability and degradability to the same level in WB clots and plasma clots. This property of Rivaroxaban may contribute to its antithrombotic effect. This study received a support from Bayer-Schering-Pharma France. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
