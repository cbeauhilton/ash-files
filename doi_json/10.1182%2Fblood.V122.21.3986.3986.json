    "abstract_text": "Background and Aim although BCR-ABL kinase domain (KD) mutations can frequently be identified in patients who develop resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) leukemias, other mechanisms may play a role. Small insertions and deletions within the BCR-ABL KD have occasionally been reported in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients who failed TKI therapy and have been hypothesized to have a causative role in drug resistance. Some were in-frame insertions and deletions, others were predicted to result in truncated BCR-ABL proteins. However, the detection of these sequence variations is hampered by the fact that they are almost always confined to subclones co-exisiting with full length BCR-ABL. This has most likely resulted in an underestimation of their frequency and complexity, since i) they can be confused with background noise/reduced quality readings in direct sequencing chromatograms and ii) cloning would be needed to better resolve overlapping sequences in these samples. The recent development of Deep Sequencing (DS) technologies has opened the way to a more accurate characterization of molecular aberrations. DS enables greater sensitivity, quantitation of sequence variant abundance and clonal analysis of a given DNA region. We thus took advantage of DS to better characterize the spectrum of insertions and deletions in CML and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients with response or resistance to TKI therapy. Methods a total of 110 samples of 41 CML and 16 Ph+ ALL patients who received one or multiple lines of TKI therapy were analyzed. DS was performed on a Roche GS Junior instrument, according to an amplicon sequencing design and protocol set up and validated in the framework of the IRON-II international study. Runs were designed to achieve high sequencing depth; this allowed to reliably identify and characterize deletions or insertions with a lower detection limit of 0.1%. In order to reconstruct the dynamics of evolution of these sequence variations in relation to the TKI administered and to the level of response achieved, we evaluated their presence in serial follow-up samples collected during TKI therapy in 15 patients. Results DS revealed a 35-base pair (bp) insertion in 35/41 (85%) CML and 14/16 (87%) Ph+ ALL patients. This sequence variation, already reported in the literature as \u201835INS\u2019, consists in the retention of 35 nucleotides (nt) from intron 8 at the exon 8 to exon 9 border. It leads to a truncated BCR-ABL variant having 10 a.a. encoded by intron 8 sequences but lacking 653 C-terminal a.a., including 22 a.a. of the KD, along with the entire C-terminal region. 35INS was detected with variable abundance (range 0.1%-96% of all BCR-ABL transcripts), but in only three samples abundance was higher than 15-20% - thus detectable also by conventional sequencing. Re-sequencing a set of samples in the same and independent runs confirmed the presence of the 35INS and demonstrated that this variant was not a PCR or sequencing artifact. Longitudinal analysis showed that the expression of 35INS fluctuated over time with no apparent correlation with response levels. In addition, DS detected one in-frame deletion in 20/41 (48%) CML patients and 7/16 (44%) Ph+ ALL patients, with an abundance ranging from 0.2% to 19%. This previously unreported variant consisted of a 72bp deletion (nt.1233-1304) at the junction of exon 6 to exon 7, that causes the loss of 24 residues (a.a. 359-383) of the KD. Conclusions Our results further underline that DS technologies allow more accurate sequence characterization in comparison to conventional methods. Minor clones harboring insertions or deletions (always involving intron/exon junctions - which implicates alternative or aberrant splicing mechanisms) were found to be very frequent both in CML and in Ph+ ALL patients but, apparently, did not correlate with response or resistance to TKI therapy. In line with our findings, a very recent functional study has demonstrated that the truncated BCR-ABL protein resulting from the 35INS is kinase-inactive and should not play any role in TKI-resistance - in contrast to what had initially been hypothesized. However, further analysis of a larger number of samples would be needed to better understand the biological and clinical meaning of these minor clones surviving TKI therapy.
