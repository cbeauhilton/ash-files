    "abstract_text": "Introduction: FMS- like tyrosine kinase gene 3 ( FLT3 ) internal tandem duplications (ITD) are associated with poor outcome in AML. They are less frequent in MDS, and their prognostic impact is not clear (Daver et al. Am J Hematolo. 2013; 88 (1): 56-9). Although RAS ( NRAS and KRAS ) mutations occur at higher frequency, their presence is not associated with outcome in MDS. Several studies have reported the dynamic acquisition and prognostic value of FLT3-ITD and RAS mutations ( FLT3-ITD m and RAS m) in patients with MDS (Takahashi et al. Leukemia. 2013; 27 (10): 2081-3). We further studied the acquisition FLT3-ITD m and/or RAS m at the time of transformation to AML in a larger group of patients and assessed its impact on survival. Method: We retrospectively analyzed 289 MDS patients who had wild type (wt) FLT3- ITD and RAS at diagnosis and were referred to our institution between 2002 and 2013. Among them, 102 (35%) patients had repeat mutation testing at the time of transformation to AML. We evaluated these patients for the frequency of FLT3-ITD m and/or RAS m acquisition at transformation and its clinical implications. Result: Twenty nine (28%) out of 102 patients acquired FLT3- ITD m or RAS m at the time of transformation to AML (23 [79%] RAS m and 6 [21%] FLT3- ITD m), but none of the patients acquired both mutations. The median age for our patients was 65 years (range, 40-83). Three (11%), 13 (46%), 11 (39%), and 2 (7%) patients had IPSS low, int-1, int-2, and high-risk disease, respectively. Eleven (38%) patients had complex cytogenetics (CG), including 8 (28%) diploid and 4 (14%) -7/7q- , and 5 (17%) patients had other CG abnormalities. Eight (28%) patients had therapy-related MDS. Fifteen (52%) patients received hypomethylating agents (HMA) alone as initial therapy for MDS, with 3 (10%) patients receiving lenalidomide, 3 (10%) HMA and investigational agents, and 3 (10%) pts received growth factors. Five (17%) patients did not receive any therapy for MDS. Four (14%) patients had stem cell transplant (SCT) at MDS diagnosis. The median number of therapies patients received for MDS was 1(range, 0-3), and 6 (21%) patients received more than 2 therapies for MDS. At the time of transformation to AML in patients who acquired FLT3-ITD m or RAS m, 8 (28%) patients had CG, including 7 (24%) diploid, 3 (10%) -7/7q- , and 4 (14%) trisomy 8, and 6 (21%) patients had other CG abnormalities. Seven (24%) patients received cytarabine + nucleoside analogues (clofarabine/cladarabine/fludarabine) as induction therapy for AML, 7 (24%) idarubicin + cytarabine (IA), 6 (21%), HMA with or without investigational agents, 5 (17%) investigational agents alone, and 4 (14%) patients received cytarabine or the IA regimen with or without investigational agents as induction therapy for AML. The median number of therapies patients received for AML was 1 (range, 1-5). Six (21%) patients had stem cell transplant (SCT) during the course of their AML therapy. The median survival after leukemia transformation in patients with FLT3-ITD m and/or RAS m was 2.43 months compared to 7.5 months in FLT3-ITD/RAS wt patients (p= <0.0001) (Fig. 1A). The median overall survival (OS) was 24 months, with no significant difference between groups (25.6 months for FLT3-ITDm and/or RAS m patients and 23.7 months for FLT3-ITD/RAS wt; p= 0.93). Patients > 60 years old had survival time of 4.7 months after AML transformation compared to 7.3 months in patients < 60 years old (p= 0.26). Patients with poor-risk CG at AML transformation (according to IPSS) had a median survival of 4.6 months compared to 7.5 months for patients with good/intermediate risk CG (p= 0.023). On multivariable analysis, FLT3-ITD m/ RAS m and poor-risk CG retained independent prognostic significance (hazard ratio [HR] 3.11, p= <0.0001, and HR 1.81, p= 0.014, respectively). In subset analysis of 52 (51%) patients with good/intermediate risk CG, 17 (33%) patients acquired mutations (12 [71%] RAS m and 5 [29%] FLT3-ITDm ). The median survival in FLT3-ITD m/ RAS m patients was 2.4 months compared to 9.3 months in wt patients (p= \u2264 0.0001) (Fig.1B). Conclusion: The temporal acquisition of FLT3-ITD or RAS mutations at transformation to AML is associated with poorer outcome. This occurs in close to a third of patients at the time of transformation and may provide opportunities for targeted therapy.
