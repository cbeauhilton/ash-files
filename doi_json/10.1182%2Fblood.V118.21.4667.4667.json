Hemostatic treatment modalities, bypassing the need for platelet transfusion, would be desirable for control of serious acute bleeds in patients with ITP. This study aimed at (i) performing a thorough characterization of the coagulopathy of ITP, (ii) investigate new ways to obtain acute correction of the coagulopathy performing in vitro experiments with recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa, NovoSeven\u00ae), fibrinogen (RiaSTAP\u00ae), and the combination of rFVIIa and fibrinogen, and finally (iii) investigate the correlation of the hemostatic response to the baseline platelet counts of the ITP patients. We challenged the hypothesis that rFVIIa combined with fibrinogen concentrate can correct whole blood (WB) clot formation in patients suffering from ITP even at very low platelet counts. Methods: Blood from 12 ITP patients and 15 healthy controls was drawn into 3.2% citrate containing corn trypsin inhibitor 18.3\u03bcg mL \u22121 to inhibit artificial contact activation. The WB (mean platelet count 22 \u00d7 10 9 L \u22121 (range 0\u201342)) was spiked in vitro with buffer (control), fresh donor platelets (+40\u00d710 9 L \u22121 ), rFVIIa (1 or 4\u03bcg mL \u22121 ), or fibrinogen (1 or 3mg mL \u22121 ) as well as the combination of rFVIIa and fibrinogen. Dynamic WB coagulation profiles were recorded by ROTEM\u00ae Thromboelastometry using activation with tissue factor (0.03pM) and re-calcification. Parameters of clot initiation (clotting time, CT), clot propagation (maximum velocity, MaxVel) as well as clot termination (maximum clot firmness, MCF) were evaluated. Thrombin generation in \u201cplatelet-rich\u201d ITP plasma was evaluated using calibrated automated thrombography. Overall differences between groups were evaluated by paired and unpaired t-tests as appropriate. Simple linear regression analyses were performed using the differences observed after addition of the various interventions (intervention \u2013 baseline) as the dependent variable (y) and the platelet count as the independent variable (x). The slope was used to evaluate dependency of the hemostatic response on the platelet count, whereas the intercept was used to evaluate the hemostatic response at very low platelet counts. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Compared with healthy controls the WB coagulation profiles of the ITP patients were characterized by a prolonged CT (mean: 1490 vs. 941s, p<0.001) as well as a markedly reduced MaxVel (3.4 vs. 9.7mm\u00d7100s \u22121 , p<0.001) and MCF (38.2 vs. 49.4mm, p=0.01). Fibrinogen showed no positive hemostatic effect. Recombinant FVIIa reduced the CT (744s, p<0.001) and increased the MaxVel (6.28mm\u00d7100s \u22121 , p 0.45) and the intercept showed a significant improvement at very low platelet counts (1\u03bcg mL \u22121 : \u2212643s, p<0.001; 4\u03bcg mL \u22121 : \u2212811s, p<0.001). In contrast, the increase in MaxVel after addition of rFVIIa was highly dependent on the platelet count (1\u03bcg mL \u22121 : R 2 = 0.81, p < 0.001; 4\u03bcg mL \u22121 : R 2 = 0.86, p < 0.001) and the intercept was not significant (1\u03bcg mL \u22121 : 0.05mm\u00d7100s \u22121 p=0.87; 4\u03bcg mL \u22121 : 0.54 mm\u00d7100s \u22121 p=0.15). The combination of fibrinogen and rFVIIa revealed a synergistic effect also showing an increased MCF (50.7mm) in addition to a reduced CT (794s) and improved MaxVel (7.9 mm\u00d7100s \u22121 ) displaying larger effects than following fresh donor platelet substitution (CT 1164s; MaxVel 6.96mm\u00d7100s \u22121 ; MCF 49.6mm). Furthermore, rFVIIa together with fibrinogen also showed a significant response at very low platelet counts in all parameters (Intercept: CT \u2212788s, MaxVel 3.3mm\u00d7100s \u22121 , MCF 13.9mm, p-values<0.004) Conclusions: Data suggest that rFVIIa combined with fibrinogen can correct the coagulopathy of ITP even at very low platelet counts, and may be an alternative to platelet transfusion. Clinical trials are needed to further investigate if this new treatment modality holds the potential to serve as an effective acute treatment option in ITP.
