    "abstract_text": "Intergenic transcripts have been discovered in globin and other multigene clusters. The role of this transcription activity in gene regulation is still unclear. We found aberrant globin gene transcripts that initiated from the regions 77 kb and 236 kb 5\u2032 to the e gene in K562 and primary cells. The most abundant splicing form of the transcripts is a 500\u2013600 bp RT-PCR product containing 36 bp RNA from the \u2212240 kb region spliced to the upstream region starting at \u2212270 bp of the e gene promoter. Several spliced transcripts also contain RNA fragments from the \u221277 kb region, or from the \u221212 kb region (between HS3 and HS2 of the LCR), or from the \u22128 kb region (between HS2 and HS1). A total of 17 different transcripts were found in K562 cells. Transient transfection assays showed that the \u221277 kb and \u2212236 kb regions had promoter activity in K562 cells. DNase I hypersensitive sites were detected in these two regions in K562 cells, but not in Jurkat cells. The \u2212236 promoter activity is located within the region encompassing a retrotransposon and the \u221277 region is located at 2 kb 5\u2032 to an olfactory receptor gene. To test whether such aberrant transcripts occur in primary cells, we tested various human tissues. In fetal bone marrow (72 days) a spliced transcript was detected by RT-PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing, which contained a 36 bp RNA from the \u2212236 kb region and was spliced to the e gene promoter starting at \u2212270 bp. Using a RNA RACE technique, we also found several aberrant globin gene transcripts in human placenta, adult bone marrow, and fetal liver (20\u201340 weeks, BD Biosciences). These transcripts contained 181 bp RNA from the \u221276 to \u221277 kb region 5\u2032 and the sequence starting at \u2212214 bp 5\u2032 to the cap site of the e gene. While it is unclear whether these transepts or transcription itself has any biological function, this erythroid-specific transcription occurring in the 200 kb region 5\u2032 to the LCR may play a yet-unknown role in globin gene regulation.",
