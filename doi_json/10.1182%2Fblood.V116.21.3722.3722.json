    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3722 Ex vivo expansion of cord blood (CB) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and cotransplantation of two CB units can enhance applicability of CB transplants to adult patients. This is the first study on cotransplantation of ex vivo expanded and unexpanded human CB units in immunodeficient mice, simulating conditions for ex vivo CB expansion clinical trials. CB units were cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with Stem Cell Factor, Flt-3 ligand, Thrombopoietin and Insulin Growth Factor Binding Protein-2 with mesenchymal stromal co-culture. Cotransplantation of unexpanded and expanded CB cells was achieved by tail vein injection into forty-five sublethally irradiated nonobese diabetic SCID-IL2\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 (NSG) mice. Submandibular bleeding was performed monthly and mice were sacrificed 4 months following transplantation to analyze for human hematopoietic engraftment. CB expansion yielded 40-fold expansion of CD34 + cells and 18-fold expansion of HSCs based on limiting dilution analysis of NSG engraftment. Mice receiving expanded grafts had 4.30% human cell repopulation, compared to 0.92% in mice receiving only unexpanded grafts at equivalent starting cell doses (p = 0.07). Ex vivo expanded grafts with lower initiating cell doses also had equivalent engraftment to unexpanded grafts with higher cell dose (8.0% vs 7.9%, p= 0.93). However, the unexpanded graft, richer in T-cells, predominated in final donor chimerism. Ex vivo expansion resulted in enhanced CB engraftment at equivalent starting cell doses, even though the unexpanded graft predominated in long-term hematopoiesis. The expanded graft with increased stem/progenitor cells enhanced initial engraftment despite eventual rejection by the unexpanded graft. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
