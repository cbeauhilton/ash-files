Survival at 2 years increased from 78% to 82%. Figure 2 The major determinants of early mortality (before day 100) were the presence of cardiac involvement with amyloid and increased levels of cardiac biomarkers, lower serum albumin, higher serum creatinine, and a higher number of organs involved. ( Table 2 ) On multivariate survival analysis, higher levels of serum troponin T and N-terminal pro\u2013brain natriuretic peptide were the only predictors of early mortality after SCT.

Recognition of this decrease in mortality is important for physicians caring for these patients as they weigh the pros and cons of SCT vs novel agent-based treatment in management of amyloidosis.
