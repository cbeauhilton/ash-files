    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3184 Background: Osteonecrosis (ON) of the femoral and humeral heads is frequently seen in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Earlier studies reported a high prevalence of thrombophilia in patients with ON. Aims: To study the prevalence of thrombophilia in patients of SCD with ON. Methods: Case records of SCD patients with ON were retrospectively reviewed for protein S, protein C, and anti-thrombin deficiency, along with activated protein C resistance (APCR). Results: A total of sixty-three patients were identified, 35 of whom were males, with a median age of 21 years (range 15to 46). Median haemoglobin, total white cell count and platelet counts were 10 g/dL (range 7.7to 13.3), 7.5 \u00d710 9 /L (range 3.4 to 16.7) and 302 \u00d710 9 /L (range 72 to 1101) respectively. Twenty-eight patients were on hydroxyurea. Thrombophilia testing showed that 29% (95% confidence interval: 17\u201340), 47% (95% CI: 29\u201364) and 79% (95% CI: 65\u201393) of the patients had low levels of functional (<60 unit/dl), total antigenic (<70 unit/dl) and free antigenic (<70 unit/dl) protein S respectively, while 21% (95% CI: 10\u201331) and 67% (95% CI: 46\u201387) had low levels of functional (<70 unit/dl) and antigenic (<70 unit/dl) protein C respectively. In addition, 14% (95% CI: 5\u201323) and 22% (95% CI: 0\u201356) of the patients had low levels of functional (<80 unit/dl) and antigenic (<80 unit/dl) anti-thrombin levels respectively. Only 2% (95% CI: 0\u20135) of these patients had an abnormally low APCR (APCR ratio \u22642.3). Summary/Conclusions: Patients with SCD and ON have a high prevalence of thrombophilia. These results indicate that a prospective study with more detailed thrombophilia work-up, along with confirmatory DNA analysis, as well as a study of the role of prophylactic anticoagulation in such patients is highly warranted.
