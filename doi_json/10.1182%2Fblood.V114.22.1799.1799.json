    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1799 Poster Board I-825 Multiple myeloma (MM) patients often present with anemia at the time of initial diagnosis. This has so far only attributed to a physically marrow suppression by the invading malignant plasma cells and the overexpression of Fas-L and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) by malignant plasma cells triggering the death of immature erythroblasts. Still the impact of MM on hematopoietic stem cells and their niches is scarcely established. In this study we analyzed highly purified CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell subsets from the bone marrow of newly diagnosed MM patients in comparison to normal donors. Quantitative flowcytometric analyses revealed a significant reduction of the megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor (MEP) proportion in MM patients, whereas the percentage of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP) was significantly increased. Proportions of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and myeloid progenitors (CMP) were not significantly altered. We then asked if this is also reflected by clonogenic assays and found a significantly decreased percentage of erythroid precursors (BFU-E and CFU-E). Using Affymetrix HU133 2.0 gene arrays, we compared the gene expression signatures of stem cells and progenitor subsets in MM patients and healthy donors. The most striking findings so far reflect reduced adhesive and migratory potential, impaired self-renewal capacity and disturbed B-cell development in HSC whereas the MEP expression profile reflects decreased in cell cycle activity and enhanced apoptosis. In line we found a decreased expression of the adhesion molecule CD44 and a reduced actin polymerization in MM HSC by immunofluorescence analysis. Accordingly, in vitro adhesion and transwell migration assays showed reduced adhesive and migratory capacities. The impaired self-renewal capacity of MM HSC was functionally corroborated by a significantly decreased long-term culture initiating cell (LTC-IC) frequency in long term culture assays. Cell cycle analyses revealed a significantly larger proportion of MM MEP in G0-phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, the proportion of apoptotic cells in MM MEP determined by the content of cleaved caspase 3 was increased as compared to MEP from healthy donors. Taken together, our findings indicate an impact of MM on the molecular phenotype and functional properties of stem and progenitor cells. Anemia in MM seems at least partially to originate already at the stem and progenitor level.
