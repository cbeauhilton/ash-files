    "abstract_text": "Plasma cell (PC) proliferative disorders vary in behavior ranging from MGUS, a usually indolent disorder, to multiple myeloma, an aggressive disease with poor long-term survival. Detecting PC immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain restriction is commonly used to demonstrate PC clonality and establish the diagnosis. Furthermore, greater degrees of peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM) involvement are associated with more aggressive disease types and, therefore, are adverse prognostic indicators. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCIP) is often used for detecting PC Ig light chain restriction. Shortcomings of FCIP as traditionally performed include its relative insensitivity and its underestimation of PC number. For these reasons, the FCIP PC clonality assessment in our laboratory is currently supplemented with a slide-based immunofluorescence (IF) technique. Recent advances in flow cytometry have led to the development of powerful instruments and reagents, potentially enhancing the ability of FCIP to analyze PC clones. In this study a newly available single tube, 6-color FCIP approach for detecting and enumerating monotypic PCs was compared to the current combined FCIP/IF assay. 94 PB and 124 BM samples were analyzed by combined FCIP/IF and single tube 6-color FCIP assays. For PB, FCIP/IF used 2-color CD38-PE/ CD45-PerCP FCIP to enumerate PCs and slide based IF to detect Ig light chain restriction. For BM FCIP/IF used two 4-color FCIP tubes (Tube1: cytoplasmic (cy)-kappa Ig-FITC/CD20-PE/CD45-PerCP/CD38-APC; Tube 2: cy-lambda Ig-FITC/CD56-PE/CD45-PerCP/CD38 APC) and slide-based IF to confirm clonality. These FCIP assays were performed on a FACSCaliber. The single tube, 6-color FCIP assay used the following fluorochrome-antibody combination: cy-kappa Ig-FITC/cy-lambda Ig-PE/CD138-PerCP-Cy5.5/CD38-APC/CD19-PE-Cy7/CD45-APC-Cy7 with data acquired on a FACSCanto. The results are summarized in Tables 1 & 2, the concordance between the methods was high. All false-negative 6-color FCIP results were attributable to the use of isotonic lysis for cell isolation. When limiting the comparison to the ficolled cells alsoused for FCIP/IF, 6-color FCIP was consistently more sensitive. The 6-color assay also allowed for the discriminition between CD19-positive polytypic PCs and CD19-negative monotypic PCs and the detection of CD45-positive monotypic PC subsets which were often present and which were not identified in the combined FCIP/IF approach. Estimates of PB disease burden generated from the 6-color technique were similar to those determined from the FCIP/IF data which have previously been shown to be of prognositic significance. 6-color FCIP allows for the rapid, sensitive detection of monotypic PCs. The ability of 6-color FCIP to detect phenotypically distinct clonal PC subsets enhances the sensitivity and may provide prognositically significant data through both more complete cell enumeration and charactarization. Given these advantages, 6-color FCIP may eventually supplant traditional FCIP methods of PC analysis. Method Comparsion in BM  Bone Marrow . . 6-color FCIP . 6-color FCIP . . . .
