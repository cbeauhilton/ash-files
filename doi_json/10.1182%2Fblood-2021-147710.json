    "abstract_text": "Iron overload and chronic viral hepatitis underlie the increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with Beta thalassemia, as recently emerged due to the prolonged survival. Conversely, there are very few studies examining the relationship between thalassemia and other malignancies. Although some Authors have indicated an increase in incidence of hematologic and solid tumours such as thyroid cancer and renal cell carcinoma, there are not enough data to make a conclusion. Moreover, there is even less data on a possible relationship between other Hemoglobinopathies and tumors risk. Seven Italian Specialized Centres for the treatment of Hemoglobinopathies, with the patronage of the \"Societ\u00e0 Italiana Talassemie ed Emoglobinopatie\" (SITE), evaluated the incidence of malignant neoplasms in Hemoglobinopathies, their site and features. Each Center considered all consecutive patients of its own historical series; the cohort included 4104 patients (48% males), followed between 1970 and 2021 (Figure 1A), for a total of 143255 person-years of observation. The most common diagnosis was Transfusion-Dependent Beta Thalassemia (TDT) with 2122 subjects (51.7%), followed by Non-Transfusion-Dependent Beta Thalassemia (NTDT, 789 subjects, 19.2%), Sickle Cell Disease (SCD, 787, 19.2%), Hemoglobin H Disease (HbH, 375, 9.1%) and Other (34, 0.8%). Two-hundred-sixty-two patients had undergone bone marrow transplantation (BMT). A total of 157 diagnoses of cancer (153 patients, 52% males) was reported during the period of observation, corresponding to a prevalence of 3.8%, with the mean age at the diagnosis of 47\u00b113 years. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was the most frequent site (62 cases) in both sexes (males 50%, females 32%) contributing to 41% of total number of cases, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, and in all type of hemoglobinopathies (except HbH). No significant differences were found in the age of diagnosis of HCC stratifying for gender (males 48\u00b114 years, females 51\u00b19 years) and types of Hemoglobinopathies (TD 48\u00b19 years, NTDT 51\u00b110 years, SCD 50\u00b114 years). After HCC, hematologic tumours (11), kidney (6), and lung (6) were the most frequent sites in men, accounting for 29% of all male cancers. For women, the most common incident cancers were breast (9), thyroid (8) and kidney (7), these representing 33% of all female cancer cases (Figure 1B). The first diagnoses of cancer dated back to the 1980s and their number sharply increased after the 2000s with a peak in the five-year period 2008-2012 and a (not significant) reduction in recent years. A similar trend may be noted considering HCC alone but in this specific case, the reduction reaches the level of significance (Figure 1C). The overall age-adjusted incidence rate of cancer in Hemoglobinopathies was estimated to be 391 cases/100000 person-years (95% C.I. 290-650) which was not statistically different from that of the Italian general population (632 cases/100000 person-years), both considering Hemoglobinopathies in total and each subgroup of patients. However, age-adjusted incidence rate of HCC was more than 7 times lower in general population (22 cases/100000 person-years) than in patients with Hemoglobinopathies (153 cases/100000 person-years, 95% C.I. 96-222, p<0.05). TDT patients had the highest HCC incidence rate and therefore the greatest difference with general population (462 cases/100000 person-years, 95% C.I. 114-899, p<0.05), followed by NTDT patients (94 cases/100000 person-years, 95% C.I. 33-188, p<0.05). The comparison between the age-adjusted incidence rate of HCC patients with SCD and general population did not reach the statistical significance. No other malignancies had a higher incidence in patients with Hemoglobinopathy than in the general population. Although preliminary, these findings provide novel insights into the relationship between cancer and Hemoglobinopathies, suggesting that the overall cancer risk is not increased in these patients. HCC is confirmed as the most frequent tumor, especially in patients with Beta Thalassemia (TD and NTDT), but advances in chelation, with renewed attention to hepatic iron, and the new drugs that have led to the eradication of hepatitis C even in these patients, may explain the recent reduction in the number of diagnoses that we have reported in this study.
