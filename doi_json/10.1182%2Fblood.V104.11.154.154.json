    "abstract_text": "To examine whether ex-vivo expanded human bone marrow (BM)-derived AC133 + cells may participate in post myocardial infarction (MI) healing, we have examined the effect of the copper chelator tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) on the ex-vivo expansion potential of BM-derived stem cell populations and the effect of the resulting ex-vivo expanded AC133 + cells in a MI animal model. AC133 + cells isolated from human BM, using the CliniMACS device, at purities greater than 90% were expanded in Teflon bags, in the presence of IL-6, TPO, Flt-3 ligand, and SCF with or without TEPA for three weeks. The progenitor cell composition and potential were examined at the end of the treatment time and after long-term incubation in culture. After 3 weeks in TEPA-treated cultures the total nuclear cell expanded more than 200\u00b120 fold. The increase in the CD34 + , AC133 + and AC133 + /CD38 - cell populations was 17\u00b113, 16\u00b11 and 270\u00b1110 - fold, respectively, and the CFU content was 84\u00b128 fold higher than at the initiation of the cultures. Contrary to TEPA treated cultures, the cultures treated in the absence of the chelator lost their progenitor populations by week 5-7 in culture. Ex-vivo expanded AC133 + cells for 3 weeks expressed VEGF and VEGF receptor RNA as examined by RT-PCR. An MI model was established in athymic nude rats by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Ex-vivo expanded AC133 + cells (6x10 6 cells/rat) or saline (control) were injected at the scar tissue 6 days post MI. Four weeks after cell therapy, the hearts were harvested and examined. Staining for smooth-muscle alpha-actin detected a 1.6-fold increase in capillary and arteriole density in the expanded cell-treated vs. control hearts. Preliminary echocardiographic studies compared 4 weeks post-treatment with those observed prior to treatment. Expanded BM-derived AC133 + injection into the infarcted myocardium improved left ventricular (LV) remodeling as demonstrated by increasing LV systolic dimensions only by 11%\u00b14 while increasing by 53%\u00b117 in control animals (p=0.02). Similarly, AC133 + cell injection improved LV contractility as demonstrated by increasing fractional shortening (FS) by 58%\u00b144 whereas FS decreased by 20%\u00b1 5 in control animals (p=0.14). In addition, AC133 + cell injection prevented scar thinning as demonstrated by a decrease in anterior wall thickness of 10%\u00b14 whereas the decrease in anterior wall thickness was 30%\u00b17.5 in control saline-treated animals (p<0.05). Clinical trials examining the safety and feasibility of intra-corronary injection of ex-vivo expanded autologous BM-derived AC133 + to patients with ischemic heart disease, are currently in preparation. Conclusion: A . TEPA allows BM-derived AC133 + cells to self renew by permitting proliferation ex-vivo while hindering their differentiation. B. Our preliminary results suggest that injection of ex-vivo expanded BM-derived AC133 + cells into infarcted myocardium results in new vessel formation and improves left ventricular function.",
