    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Elderly pts with R/R AML not eligible for cytotoxic therapy have limited therapeutic options, and dismal outcomes with available therapies. In preclinical studies, inhibition of BCL-2 and MDM2 with Ven and Idasa, respectively, has demonstrated potent synergistic apoptotic activity. In this ongoing, open-label, Phase Ib study, the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of Ven+cobimetinib (Arm A) and Ven+Idasa (Arm B) is being assessed in R/R AML (NCT02670044). Initial analysis indicated a tolerable safety profile for Ven+Idasa. Here, we present updated safety and efficacy results from Arm B. Methods: Pts (\u226560 years) with R/R AML or secondary AML, previously treated for an antecedent hematologic disease but treatment na\u00efve for AML, and ineligible for cytotoxic therapy/allogeneic stem cell transplant were enrolled. The maximum tolerated dose of Ven+Idasa was determined by two-dimensional dose escalation. Pts received Ven orally (PO) daily (400 or 600mg) + Idasa PO daily on Days (D) 1-5 (150mg, 200mg, or 400mg) in 28-day cycles. Responses were assessed according to revised International Working Group Response Criteria 2003. Pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses were performed on plasma samples on Cycles (C) 1 and 2, D1 and 5, and C4, D1. Exploratory assessments included minimal residual disease (MRD), assayed centrally at Covance Laboratories using 8-color flow cytometry. Data cut-off was June 21, 2019. Results: At data cut-off, 49 pts were treated with Ven+Idasa. Median age was 72 years (range 62-93); Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1: 84%; refractory AML: 57%; relapsed AML: 33%; and secondary previously untreated AML: 10%; Intermediate-I or Intermediate-II European Leukemia Net (ELN) risk classification: 66%; adverse ELN classification: 30%; de novo (49%) versus secondary (51%) AML; and median prior lines of treatment: 1 (range 1-4). Most common adverse events (AEs; any grade) irrespective of attribution were diarrhea (90%) and nausea (78%); the most common grade \u22653 AEs were febrile neutropenia (45%), neutropenia (27%), and thrombocytopenia (25%; Table 1 ). Laboratory tumor lysis syndrome occurred in 3 pts; none resulted in treatment discontinuation. Ven and Idasa treatment discontinuation due to AEs were noted in 18% and 20%, respectively, most commonly due to infections. 30- and 60-day mortality rates were 6% and 17%, respectively. No apparent PK drug-drug interaction was found between Ven and Idasa; overlap in Ven and Idasa exposure was substantial over the doses tested. Anti-leukemic response rate (complete response [CR] + CR with incomplete platelet count recovery [CRp] + CR with incomplete blood count recovery [CRi] + partial response [PR] + morphologic leukemia-free state [MLFS]) across all dose levels was 41% ( Table 2 ). Across the two Ven 600mg cohorts being considered for the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D), the anti-leukemic response rate was 50% (CR+CRp+CRi rate 29%). Median time to CR+CRp+CRi+PR was 1.4 months (range 1-3), with a median response (CR+CRp+CRi) duration of 4.9 months (range 0.6-9.7). Median overall survival in all pts and in the Ven 600mg cohorts was 4.4 months and 5.7 months, respectively, with a median follow-up of 3.4 months (range 0.03-18). Individual pt responses are shown in Figure 1. MRD negativity (<0.1%) was achieved in 45% (5/11) of pts with CR+CRp+CRi. Updated pre- and post-therapy mutation and BCL-2 family protein data and association with clinical response will be presented. Conclusions: The non-chemotherapy combination of Ven+Idasa demonstrated encouraging safety and efficacy in elderly pts with R/R AML who were ineligible for cytotoxic chemotherapy. The anti-leukemic response rate at the dose levels being considered for the RP2D was 50%, with a CR+CRp+CRi rate of 29%. Updated predictive biomarker data will be presented. Evaluation of Ven+Idasa RP2D is ongoing, and will be followed by dose expansion.
