    "abstract_text": "The development of resistance to chemotherapy represents an adaptive biological response by tumor cells that leads to treatment failure and patient relapse. During the course of their evolution (intrinsic resistance) or in response to chemotherapy (acquired resistance), tumor cells may undergo genetic alterations to possess a drug resistant phenotype. Dysregulation of membrane transport proteins and cellular enzymes, as well as altered susceptibility to commit to apoptosis are among the mechanisms that contribute to the genesis of acquired drug resistance. Recently, the development of approaches to prevent and/or to reverse this phenomenon has attracted special interest and a number of drug candidates have been identified. Despite strong effects observed for these candidates in vitro , however, most of them fail in vivo . In the present study, we have identified a novel small molecule inhibitor of dual NF-\u03baB and oxidative stress pathways, OT-304, as a potential candidate to reverse drug resistance. Initial investigations indicate that this compound effectively inhibits proliferation of doxorubicin-sensitive and doxorubicin-resistant cells to the same extent, suggesting that it is capable of bypassing the development of drug resistance. Additional experiments reveal that OT-304 enhances cancer cell sensitivity to doxorubicin and to etoposide, particularly in cells characterized by the over-expression of the drug transporter P-glycoprotein. These findings suggest that either the expression/and or the function of P-glycoprotein could be affected by OT-304. In vivo studies using tumor xenografts in nude mice showed that OT-304 is also capable of preventing the growth of drug resistant cancer cells. This later finding further confirms the role of OT-304 as a drug resistance-reversing agent and warrants further pre-clinical and clinical investigation to determine its efficacy in treating aggressive tumors.",
