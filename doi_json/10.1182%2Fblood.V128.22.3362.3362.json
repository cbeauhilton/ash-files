    "abstract_text": "Adoptive T-cell therapy with single-chain variable fragment (scFv)-derived chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) has transformed cancer therapy. Nevertheless, treatment failure can occur and is often associated with loss of the targeted antigen-an outcome affecting nearly 65% of patients that have failed CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy (1). Targeting more than one tumor antigen expressed on the surface of tumor cells to mitigate antigen loss is a strategy that has been tested preclinically with CAR-T therapy. This approach is challenging due to the complexities of validating numerous CAR constructs or generating functional CARs which contain several tandem scFvs. The Antibody-Coupled T-cell Receptor (ACTR) platform is a universal, engineered T-cell therapy technology developed to mediate anti-tumor activity in combination with tumor-targeting antibodies. The ACTR construct, derived from human CD16 and coupled to T-cell signaling domains, is designed to engage the Fc domain of therapeutic antibodies, resulting in a novel platform for T-cell targeted cancer therapy. In contrast to CAR T-cell constructs that are restricted to a single antigen, the ACTR platform is highly adaptable, which can be targeted against a diverse set of tumor antigens-thus circumventing the need to generate and characterize multiple CAR-T therapeutics. We first determined whether ACTR expressing T cells could be combined with a diverse array of tumor-targeting antibodies directed against B cell malignancies. Using cell lines derived from B cell lymphomas or multiple myeloma, we found that ACTR-expressing T cells could be activated with antibodies against multiple B-cell targets including CD19, CD20, CD22, CD38, and CS1. One approach to address CD19 antigen loss in patients relapsing following CD19 CAR-T therapy is to treat with a CD22 CAR-T therapy (2). Given that ACTR can be paired with single antibodies as described above, a flexible sequential administration of targeted antibodies could be utilized. However, we also sought to determine whether combinations of antibodies against CD19 and CD22, when used concurrently, could improve ACTR-activity. We found that dual antigen targeting with anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 antibodies could enhance both ACTR-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine production in an antibody dose-dependent manner. Taken together, our results provide preclinical evidence for ACTR as a universal, chimeric receptor that could engage multiple tumor antigens with potential to improve patient outcomes by eliminating antigen negative relapse.
