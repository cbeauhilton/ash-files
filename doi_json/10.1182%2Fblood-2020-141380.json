    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The combination of hypomethylating agents with venetoclax (HMA+VEN) has demonstrated preferential activity in patients (pts) with isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH ) 1/2 mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). With the increasing availability of single and combination therapies including oral small-molecule inhibitors of IDH1 and IDH2 , respectively, additional detail regarding depth of remission and duration of response (DOR) with the various combinations of active agents in larger datasets are desired. Methods: We reviewed pts with newly diagnosed (ND) and relapsed/refractory (R/R) IDH1/IDH2 mutated AML treated with HMA+VEN at our institution between 2014 and present. A subset of these pts received IDH inhibitor (IDHi)-based regimens at alternate timepoints; these data were used for within-patient comparisons. Responses were defined by 2017 ELN criteria with the additional incorporation of measurable residual disease (MRD) assessment by flow cytometry (MRD-FC, sensitivity 10 -3 -10 -4 ). Mutant IDH ( mIDH ) variant allele frequency (VAF) from amplicon-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) of bone marrow samples performed pre-treatment, at best response, and other available timepoints were analyzed for MRD by NGS (MRD-NGS, limit of detection 1-2%). OS was defined as the time from start of HMA + VEN to death or last follow up. Results: Sixty-five pts (36 ND, 29 R/R; 45 mIDH2, 19 mIDH1, 1 both isotypes) received HMA+VEN; pre-treatment characteristics are shown in Figures A and B. Median age was 69 years; 45% percent had ELN adverse risk disease. Most frequent co-mutations (Figure C) were SRSF2 (42%), DNMT3A (38%), and NPM1 (28%). After a median of 1 cycle (range 1-5), ORR for HMA+VEN received as any line of therapy was 79% (CR 42%, CRi 26%, MLFS 11%, PR 0%). Ninety percent (36/40) of CR+CRi responses with evaluable MRD-FC were MRD negative. CR+CRi rates were 86% in ND pts and 100% in ND pts with mutated NPM1. Presence of a RAS-pathway and/or TP53 mutation was associated with a trend to lower likelihood of CR/CRi in R/R disease (35.7% vs. 53.3%, p=0.46). Fifty-two percent (23/44) of pts with available longitudinal mIDH VAF data were negative by MRD-NGS at time of best response (16 pts) or subsequently, the latter after a median of 4 (range 2-6) additional cycles of therapy. The median change in mIDH VAF from pre-treatment to time of best response or subsequent MRD-NGS negativity was -19%, corresponding to a median within-pt VAF reduction of 98%. MRD negativity by FC and mIDH NGS corresponded to quality of marrow response (Figure C). Median DOR was 17.0 months for all pts and 24.1 months when HMA+VEN was given frontline. Median OS was 42.2 months and is stratified by 2017 ELN risk in Figure D. Of the 65 pts treated with HMA+VEN, 34 pts received 37 different IDHi-containing regimens as separate lines of therapy. Most (35/37) IDHi regimens (monotherapy 32%, IDHi+HMA 32%, IDHi+HMA+VEN 27%, IDHi+ICT 8%) were given after progression/relapse on antecedent therapy. After a median of 4 cycles (range 1-23), ORR was 54% (CR 24%, CRi 19%, MLFS 8%, PR 3%); the highest CR+CRi rate (67%) was seen with the IDHi + HMA + VEN combination. The median change in mIDH VAF from pre-treatment to best response was -1%, corresponding to a median within-pt VAF reduction of 31%. Comparing within-patients, subsequent treatment with an IDHi-containing regimen after HMA+VEN led to a salvage response rate of 52%; 10/13 responses were CR/CRi, and 8/13 responses bridged the pt to SCT. In pts who instead received HMA+VEN after lack/loss of response to an IDHi regimen, the salvage response rate was higher at 72%; 6/8 responses were CR/CRi, 5/8 responses bridged the pt to SCT. Conclusions: While not targeted therapy per se, we confirm that the combination of HMA+VEN leads to an impressive CR/CRi rate with longstanding DOR in IDH1/IDH2 mutated AML, particularly in the frontline setting and in NPM1 co-mutated disease. Although accompanying MRD negativity by flow cytometry is frequent, almost half of pts retain an IDH mutation detectable by NGS, suggesting a role for combination therapy with IDH inhibitors. Additionally, we identify excellent outcomes in the relapsed setting, although the presence of a RAS-pathway or TP53 mutation may confer treatment resistance. The high within-patient salvage response rates when switching between HMA+VEN and IDHi-containing regimens warrant further investigation of combination vs. sequential therapy approaches.
