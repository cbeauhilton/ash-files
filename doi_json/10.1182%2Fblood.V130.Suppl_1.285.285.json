    "abstract_text": "Normal erythroid maturation is highly regulated to maximize the production of HbA heterotetramer (\u03b12\u03b22) and minimize the accumulation of potentially toxic free \u03b1- or \u03b2-globin subunits. In \u03b2-thalassemia, \u03b2-globin gene ( HBB ) mutations cause buildup of free \u03b1-globin, which forms intracellular precipitates that impair erythroid cell maturation and viability. Endogenous mechanisms exist to detoxify free \u03b1-globin, as evidenced by clinical observations that most individuals with HBB haploinsufficiency (\u03b2-thalassemia trait) are asymptomatic. Previously, we showed that free \u03b1-globin is eliminated in erythroid precursors by the ubiquitin-proteasome (UPS) system and by a lysosomal-dependent process presumed to be autophagy (Khandros et al., Blood 2012;119:5265). Our current study investigates the latter. Atg5 is required for basal autophagy and autophagosome formation via conjugation with Atg12 in most cell types. We investigated whether Atg5 played a selective role in eliminating free \u03b1-globin during unbalanced globin chain synthesis. \u03b2-thalassemic mice ( Hbb Th3/+ ) carrying a conditional Atg5 allele ( Atg5fl ) in which exon 3 is flanked by loxP sites were interbred with mice expressing erythroid-specific Cre recombinase (EpoR-Cre). Loss of Atg5 in \u03b2-thalassemic erythroid precursors inhibited autophagy, as evidenced by the accumulation of the markers p62/SQSTM1 and LC3. However, there was minimal effect on the \u03b2-thalassemic phenotype as measured by RBC count, Hb, hematocrit, reticulocyte count, and spleen weight. Moreover, loss of Atg5 did not alter the level of insoluble \u03b1-globin in \u03b2-thalassemic RBC fractions, as assessed by triton-acetic acid-urea (TAU) gel electrophoresis to resolve the \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin chains. Thus, Atg5, a key component of canonical autophagy, is not required for the elimination of free \u03b1-globin in \u03b2-thalassemia. The Ulk1 (unc-51\u2212like kinase 1) protein kinase participates in canonical and alternative autophagy pathways and mediates mitophagy during erythropoiesis. To determine the role of Ulk1 in a-globin degradation, we introduced a null allele into Hbb Th3/+ mice. Ulk1 \u2212/\u2212 Hbb Th3/+ mice were born at normal Mendelian ratio, but exhibited a high rate of perinatal death. Only 20% of double-mutant mice survived for 30 days (n=5), compared to 70% of Ulk1 +/+ Hbb Th3/+ mice (n=13) ( P 87% engraftment after 30 days). Loss of Ulk1 exacerbated the \u03b2-thalassemic phenotype, as evidence by reduced Hb (10.85 \u00b1 0.18 vs 10.21 \u00b1 0.18 g/dL, n=14 vs 8; P <0.01), reduced RBC number (7.37 \u00b1 0.13 vs 6.35 \u00b1 0.09 \u00d7 10 6 /mL; P <0.0001), increased reticulocyte count (17.99 \u00b1 2.76 vs 39.41 \u00b1 2.14%; P <0.0001), and increased spleen weight (0.24 \u00b1 0.01 vs 0.34 \u00b1 0.03 g; P <0.01). Moreover, insoluble \u03b1-globin was increased by approximately 2-fold in Ulk1 \u2212/\u2212 Hbb Th3/+ reticulocytes, ascompared to Ulk1 +/+ Hbb Th3/+ cells (Figure). To assess the turnover of newly synthesized free \u03b1-globin, we pulse-labeled reticulocytes with 35 S amino acids and chased with or without a proteasome inhibitor (MG132) or a lysosome inhibitor (chloroquine or bafilomycin A1). Analysis of control ( Ulk1 +/+ Hbb Th3/+ ) reticulocytesshowed that newly synthesized insoluble free \u03b1-globin was cleared by separate proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. In marked contrast, the lysosomal-dependent \u03b1-globin degradation pathway was completely eliminated in Ulk1 \u2212/\u2212 Hbb Th3/+ reticulocytes. Thus, we conclude that Ulk1 mediates the degradation of free \u03b1-globin in \u03b2-thalassemia. Our findings illustrate a new mechanism through which protein quality-control pathways can modulate the severity of \u03b2-thalassemia by eliminating unstable free \u03b1-globin, and they open up possibilities for new therapeutic approaches, as Ulk1 activity can be modulated pharmacologically.
