    "abstract_text": "Abstract 665 Historically, age has been the main patient (pt)-specific decision-making factor for allogeneic HCT. The HCT comorbidity index (CI) was developed to capture pretransplant comorbidities. The index predicts non-relapse mortality (NRM) and has revolutionized outcome analysis for allogeneic HCT. Whether calendar age adds additional level of information to the HCT-CI in outcome prediction is unknown. Here, we investigated 1) how well the HCT-CI predicts outcomes across different age groups and 2) whether age could be incorporated into the HCT-CI. Data from 3033 consecutive pts treated with allogeneic HCT between January 2000 and December 2006 from HLA-matched related or unrelated donors at five collaborating institutions were used for this study. All data were collected by a single investigator, who was blinded from the final outcomes of pts, to ensure consistent comorbidity coding. Median age was 45 (range 0.1\u201374.5) years. Overall, there was a weak correlation between increasing age and increasing HCT-CI scores (r=0.26). Pts were randomly divided into training (n=1853) and validation (n=1180) sets. In the training set, the HCT-CI predicted increased cumulative incidence rates of NRM and worsening of overall survival (OS) rates consistently in the 5 separate age groups ( Table 1 ). Pulmonary function tests were not performed in 51% of pts <20 years of age, which might have affected the assignment of HCT-CI scores. Scores of 0, 1\u20132, and \u22653 were assigned to 28%, 32%, and 40%, respectively, of pts \u226520 years of age compared to 55%, 27%, and 18% of pts <20 years of age. Nevertheless, HCT-CI scores predicted OS of 73%, 61%, and 41% ( p <0.0001), respectively, among pts <20 years of age.

In this model, tests of homogeneity of HRs associated with HCT-CI scores of 1\u20132 and \u22653 across age groups were not rejected for either NRM ( p =0.66 and p =0.86, respectively) or OS ( p= 0.76 and p =0.24, respectively). Increasing HCT-CI scores were associated with the highest HRs for NRM compared to other covariates. Pts in age groups 40\u201350, 50\u201360, and >60 years had HRs for NRM ranging between 1.48\u20131.84 compared to pts 40 years was assigned a score of 1 to be added to the HCT-CI scores. In the validation set, although we continued to observe increases in HRs for NRM with increasing age, only minor improvement in c-statistics for NRM (0.66 versus 0.68) was detected when age was added to the HCT-CI.

Age >40 years had an impact equivalent to a single comorbidity with a weight of 1, and therefore should be assigned a score of 1 when using the HCT-CI/Age composite index.
