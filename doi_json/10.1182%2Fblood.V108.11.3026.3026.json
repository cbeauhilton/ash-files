    "abstract_text": "Background: T cell NHL represent approximately 10\u201315% of all lymphomas. Pts with T cell NHL are often treated similarly to patient with B cell NHL, although the clinical outcomes of most patients with T- NHL tend to be worse with the exception of ALK positive anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL). Updated classifications in recent years have recognized specific clinical and pathologic T cell entities with distinct clinical courses and this poses a challenge to the systemic study of these diseases. The exact role of allogenic transplant in T- cell NHL is unknown. Methods: We looked at 45 pts who underwent an allogeneic HSCT for T cell lymphomas between Jan 2000 to Dec 2005. There were 18 males, 27 females. Median age at transplant was 32 (7\u201374). Histology was Mycosis fungoides /Sezary syndrome (SS/MF) n=10, T cell lymphobalstic leukemia (PTLL) n=16, PTCL including AILD and ALCL n=14, NKT cell n=5. Syngeneic donor 1, Sibs 31, MUD 13. Median time from diagnosis to transplant was 12.5 (3.6\u201388.3) mo. Source of stem cells BM 9, PBSCT 35, cord blood 1. Conditioning, fully ablative 29, reduced intensity 16. Median number of prior regimens MF/SS 5, PTLL 2, PTCL 3, NKTL 2 with only 2 pts with prior auto transplants. 18 pts were in remission at the time of transplant and 12 pts had induction failure. Results: Median follow up from transplant was 45.3 mo(0.7\u201364.7) with a 55.6%OS. Incidence of GVHD was Acute n= 27 extensive chronic n=20. Cause of death was transplant related in 16 pts with only 3 pts dying of disease progression. The overall survival is 61.2 % at 1 year,55.4% at 2 years and 48.5% at 5 years with a 5 year progression free survival at 48.5%. Based on different histologies, the results are 50.0% overall survival at 1 year and 40.0% at 2 and 5 years for SS/MF, 55.6% at 1 and 2 years for PTLL, 70.1% at 1 and 2 years and 52.6% at 5 years for PTCL and 80% at 1 year for NKT shown in fig 1 and 2. Conclusion: Allogenic transplant can result in long term survival for some patients with T cell NHL suggesting a graft vs lymphoma effect. Timing of transplant needs to be better defined. Most patients are heavily pretreated which may have resulted in more transplant related mortality with 11/20 pts dying of infection. Most patients did not have a prior auto transplant indicating early progression of disease after standard therapies defined for B cell malignancies.
