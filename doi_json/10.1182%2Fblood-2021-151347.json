    "abstract_text": "Missense variants in the von Willebrand factor (VWF) platelet binding domain, A1, may pathologically hyperactivate or weaken interactions with its platelet receptor, GPIb\u03b1, and lead to von Willebrand disease (VWD) subtypes 2B or 2M, respectively. Variants identified in VWD patients and tested as recombinant VWF have supported genotype-phenotype associations and subtyping of VWD by genetic analyses. However, novel variants, most classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are poorly defined. To functionally characterize a large subset of VWF A1 variants (P1254-L1460), we screened a phage display library for binding to a recombinant form of GPIb\u03b1 used to clinically assess VWF platelet binding activity, GPIbM. Comprised of ~5x10 6 independent clones, the phage display library contained 1,427 unique, missense variants (~36% of all possible single amino acid substitutions) which could be scored for significant enrichment, depletion, or no change following selection for GPIbM binding. The enrichment of phage displayed VWD variants previously classified as VWD subtype 2B significantly segregated from reported 2M variants (mean fold change from preselected phage ~1.06 for 2B vs. ~0.68 for 2M, p < 0.005). To further validate these findings, five depleted, four unchanged, and seven enriched VWF A1 variants were introduced into the full length VWF sequence by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed by transient transfection of HEK293T cells. Conditioned media were collected and analyzed for VWF level (VWF:Ag) and activity (VWF:GPIbM). Of the sixteen variants examined, fourteen (87.5%) exhibited a VWF GPIbM:Ag ratio that was concordant with the phage display findings. Furthermore, the VWF GPIbM:Ag ratios were well correlated with the degree of enrichment by phage display (Pearson R = 0.69, p< 0.01). Taken together, these findings demonstrate phage display as a high content approach to measure and functionally define the platelet-binding activity of genetic variants within the VWF A1 domain.
