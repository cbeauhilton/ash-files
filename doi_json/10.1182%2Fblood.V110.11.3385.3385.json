    "abstract_text": "Although overexpression of members of the ATP-Binding-Cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily has been implicated in chemotherapy failure in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in some studies, results have been conflicting. Previously we found no consistent difference in pre-treatment ABC transporter expression when comparing total blasts of 18 patients achieving complete remission (CR) and 13 patients who were refractory to induction chemotherapy (NR). However, among the CD34 + CD38 \u2212 AML cells (enriched for candidate \u201cleukemic stem cells\u201d which engraft in immunodeficient mice), as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR, elevated expression of MDR1 and/or BCRP1 , two ABC transporters associated with drug resistance, was found in 8/10 NR patients as compared to 0/7 CR patients. No difference between CR and NR samples was observed in the more differentiated CD34 + CD38 + or CD34 \u2212 AML cells while none of the subpopulations showed a significant difference in MRP1 expression between CR and NR patient samples. To determine if this difference in gene expression was associated with altered functional activity of MDR1 / BCRP1, the relative sensitivity of subpopulations of AML cells to induction of apoptosis following ex vivo treatment with daunorubicin with or without ABC inhibitors (PSC-833 and Verapamil) was assessed. All subpopulations of AML cells isolated from 2 CR patients showed similar drug sensitivity profiles (IC 50 <0.04 \u03bcg/ml). In contrast, CD34 + CD38 \u2212 cells from 6 NR patients were more resistant to daunorubicin-induced apoptosis (p<0.05 for comparison of IC 50 s between CR and NR samples). ABC transporter inhibition in CD34 + CD38 \u2212 cells did not change daunorubicin sensitivity in CR samples, but increased drug sensitivity in a dose-dependent manner in NR samples, particularly in the CD34 + CD38 \u2212 fraction. This suggests a role for ABC transporters in sustaining a population of chemotherapy resistant leukemic stem cells which may allow survival of the malignant clone in patients following induction therapy. If the value of measuring MDR1 / BCRP1 expression among these cells in predicting chemotherapy outcome is confirmed in a larger patient population, it may be possible to use such analysis to modify therapy for individual AML patients to overcome drug resistance.",
