    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic malignancy that is treated in medically fit patients with intensive induction chemotherapy (IT) and postremission therapy to achieve a complete and long-term remission. The incidence of obesity in the general population is steadily increasing and has been identified as a major risk factor for all-cause mortality. Despite previous studies assessing the role of obesity in AML patients undergoing IT, there is an ongoing debate on the impact of obesity on patient outcome as well as the optimal dosing strategy in obese AML patients. We conducted a retrospective registry study assessing 1677 AML patients who were treated with IT for newly diagnosed AML. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) while event-free survival (EFS), the rate of first complete remission (CR1), relapse/refractory disease and non-relapse/refractory-related mortality (NRRrM), treatment-related toxicities, patient comorbidities and chemotherapy dosing strategies were analyzed as secondary endpoints. Obese patients (body mass index, BMI \u2265 30) displayed a significant inferior median OS (29.44 vs. 47.94 months, p = 0.015) without a significant difference in median EFS (7.8 vs. 9.89 months, p = 0.3) compared to non-obese patients (BMI < 30). The cumulative incidence (CI) of NRRrM was significantly increased in obese patients compared to non-obese patients while no differences could be observed regarding the CI of relapsed or refractory disease. Obesity was identified as an independent risk factor for death (HR 1.27, [95% CI 1.07-1.51], p = 0.005) in a multivariable Cox regression analysis. When the cohort was stratified by age (\u2265/< 60 years), the difference in OS as well as the significantly increased CI of NRRrM was only observed in patients \u2265 60 years. Notably, obese patients demonstrated higher rates of cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities regardless of their age. No disparities for OS, EFS, CR1 rate or treatment-related toxicities were observed when the entire study population was stratified for the used dosing strategy (dose calculation using total body weight, idealized body weight, adjusted idealized body weight or capped at body surface area of 2 m 2 ). In conclusion, the present study identifies obesity as a major independent risk factor for worse overall survival and increased CI of non-relapse/refractory-related mortality in older (\u226560 years) AML patients undergoing curative IT. These findings may be most likely attributed to obesity related comorbidities and not to dose adaption of chemotherapy in obese AML patients.
