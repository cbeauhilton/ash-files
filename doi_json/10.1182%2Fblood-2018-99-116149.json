    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene ( FLT3- ITD), resulting in duplication of 3 to more than hundreds of nucleotides, are present in approximately 25% of adults with newly diagnosed AML. Several studies have shown that ITD mutations are associated with poor prognosis due to a high relapse rate, in particular in case of a high mutant to wild-type allele ratio and/or insertion site in the beta1-sheet of the tyrosine kinase domain-1 (beta1-sheet). Aims: To investigate the relationship between ITD insertion site and patient outcome, Roche 454 next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed in 452/555 (81.4%) FLT3- ITD positive patients (pts) enrolled into the RATIFY trial (NCT00651261). Results: NGS identified 908 ITDs with up to 9 ITDs per case (1 ITD: n=210, 46.5%; 2 ITDs: n=131, 29.0%; 3 ITDs: n=58, 12.8%; 4 ITDs: n=24, 5.3%; 5 ITDs: n=18, 4.0%; 6 ITDs: n=3, 0.7%; 7 ITDs: n=7, 1.5%; 9 ITDs: n=1, 0.2%). Median ITD-size was 45 nucleotides (range, 6-246); all ITDs were in-frame with direct head-to-tail orientation. According to the 4 functional groups, 488 ITDs (53.7%) were located within the juxtamembrane domain (JMD), 155 ITDs (17.1%) within the hinge region, 211 ITDs (23.2%) within the beta1-sheet, and 54 ITDs (5.9%) 3\u00b4of beta1-sheet. ITD size strongly correlated with insertion site, in that the more C-terminal the insertion site, the longer the size of the inserted fragment ( P <.001). In 242 pts (53.5%) featuring multiple ITD clones, 698 concurrent integration sites were delineated, with coexistent integration sites within JMD being the most frequent interaction (37%) followed by JMD and beta1-sheet (13.5%), and within beta1-sheet (7.8%). NPM1 mutations ( NPM1 mut ) were present in 203/358 pts (56.7%). Correlation of ITD insertion site with NPM1 mut revealed a significantly lower incidence of NPM1 mut in pts with insertion located within the hinge region (50/106, 47.2% vs 153/252, 60.7%; P =.02) and 3\u00b4of beta1-sheet (14/41, 34.1% vs 189/317, 59.6%; P =.002), whereas NPM1 mut were significantly more frequent in pts with insertions affecting JMD (143/235, 60.9% vs 60/123, 48.8%; P =.03). Clinical characteristics differing among the 4 functional ITD groups were gender and WBC. Pts with insertions 3\u00b4of beta1-sheet were predominantly male (28/46, 60.9% vs 178/406, 43.8%; P =.03); pts with JMD insertions exhibited lower WBC (median 36.5 vs 52.7 x10 9 /L; P =.03). Complete remission (CR) was achieved within 60 days in 248/452 pts (54.9%). To evaluate the impact of ITD insertion site on response to induction, a logistic regression model was used. ITD insertion sites were categorized in (i) only in beta1-sheet, (ii) in beta1-sheet and other sites, and (iii) outside the beta1-sheet. Other variables were ITD mutant to wild-type allelic ratio (fragment analysis, cutoff at 0.5), number of ITDs per patient, log2 of WBC counts, age, NPM1 mut , and midostaurin treatment. In this model, only number of ITDs predicted lower CR rate (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57-0.90), while NPM1 mut was a favorable marker for CR (OR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.70-4.28). Median follow-up for survival was 60.6 months (mo); median event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.9 mo and 24.4 mo, respectively. The 4-year EFS and OS rates were 21.0% (95% CI, 17.2%-24.8%) and 42.6% (95% CI, 37.9%-47.4%), respectively. Survival analysis according to categorized insertion site groups showed that pts exhibiting insertion exclusively in the beta1-sheet had significantly inferior OS ( P =.014) compared to the other two groups. Multivariate models for OS and EFS including hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) as a time-dependent covariate revealed WBC counts as unfavorable and NPM1 mut as favorable for both endpoints; further unfavorable factors were older age and exclusive insertion in the beta1-sheet (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.01-2.20) for OS and number of ITDs (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.04-1.28) for EFS; HSCT was a favorable factor only for EFS (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44-0.99). Midostaurin treatment was associated with in trend improved EFS (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.63-1.03) and OS (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.57-1.02). Conclusions: In this large cohort of 452 FLT3- ITD mutated AML treated within the RATIFY trial the negative prognostic impact of beta1-sheet insertion site of FLT3 -ITD could be confirmed. Further analyses to investigate potential predictive effects of midostaurin treatment are ongoing. Support: U10CA180821, U10CA180882, U24CA196171, (CCSRI) #704970.
