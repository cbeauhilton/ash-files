    "abstract_text": "Ex vivo expansion of cord blood products (CB) has been proposed as an approach to increase the number of cells available from a single CB unit. We and others have reported the requirement of CD34 selection for optimal expansion of CB products, however, the selection of frozen CB products results in significant losses of CD34+ cells with a median recovery of 43% (range 6 to 203%, N=40) and low purities resulting in decreased expansion. Therefore we explored approaches to expand CB without prior selection and have described the use of co-culture of CB mononuclear cells (MNC) on mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). In the present study we have evaluated the expansion of clinical CB products (provided by Duke University CB Bank CB). MNC were obtained after ficol separation of RBCs and 10% of the CB product was cultured on preformed layers of MSC in T150 flasks containing 50ml of defined media (Sigma Aldrich) plus 100 ng/ml each of rhSCF, rhG-CSF and rhTpo. After 6 days of culture, the non adherent cells were transferred to a Teflon bag and a further 50 ml of media and GFs added to the flask. Again at day 10, non adherent cells were transferred to the Teflon bag and media and growth factors replaced. At day 12 to 13 of incubation the cells were harvested, washed and total nucleated cell (TNC) counts and progenitor assays performed. In three separate experiments we have achieved greater than 20 fold expansion of TNC with a median of 22, and a median expansion of GM-CFC of 37 fold. Morphologic analysis demonstrated the expanded cells contained high levels of mature neutrophils and neutrophil precursors. In vivo studies in NOD/SCID mice also demonstrated that the expanded cells maintained in vivo engraftment potential. Clinical studies are being designed to evaluate the in vivo potential of CB MNC products expanded on MSC."
