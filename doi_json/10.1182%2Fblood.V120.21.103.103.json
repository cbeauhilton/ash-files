    "abstract_text": "Abstract 103 Background: Besides its well-known role in initiation and propagation of thrombus formation, thrombin may have multiple pro-atherogenic actions. Hypothesis: Pharmacologic thrombin inhibition attenuates the onset and progression of atherosclerosis and favors plaque stability in hypercoagulable mice prone to aggressive atherosclerosis development. Methods and Results: Hypercoagulability in TM Pro/Pro :ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in severe atherosclerotic burden formation compared to ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice (389.1*10 3 \u03bcm 2 vs. 187.0*10 3 \u03bcm 2 , p<0.0005). Pro-coagulant mice showed larger necrotic cores, decreased plaque collagen content, vast stenosis (up to 90%) and enhanced outward remodeling. Hypercoagulability markedly increased systemic and vascular inflammation, represented by significantly higher CXCL1, MCP-1 and G-CSF plasma levels, pronounced neutrophilia, enhanced Ly6G+ cells arrest to carotid plaques, increased neutrophil recruitment (IHC/Intravital Microscopy), massive intraplaque hemorrhage and spontaneous plaque ruptures. Genetically diminished prothrombin levels (FII -/WT :ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice) caused a significant decrease in atherosclerosis (72.5*10 3 \u03bcm 2 vs. 128.4*10 3 \u03bcm 2 , p<0.01) with a pronounced stable phenotype with less/smaller necrotic cores, thicker fibrous caps and abundant collagen and vascular smooth muscle cell content. Ly6G + cell intraplaque recruitment was reduced and white blood cell counts and IL-6 levels (3.8\u00b11.66 vs. 8.8\u00b15.34 pg/mL, p<0.05) were diminished compared to control mice. Remarkably, administration of the oral direct thrombin inhibitor Dabigatran etexilate or the anticoagulant activated protein C (APC) in TM Pro/Pro :ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice reduced lesions formation by > 80%, suppressed leukocyte recruitment, enhanced plaque stability, whereas numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines were diminished to levels comparable to non-atherosclerotic mice. Conclusion: These data establish a pivotal role for thrombin generation in controlling the level of inflammation related to atherosclerosis development in ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice. The potential clinical impact of long term administration of novel classes of anticoagulants on atherosclerosis merits further study.
