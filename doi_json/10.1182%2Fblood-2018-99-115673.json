    "abstract_text": "Background: Trabectedin is an FDA-approved DNA minor groove binder (MGB) that has activity against translocation-associated sarcomas. Lurbinectedin is a next-generation MGB with pre-clinical activity against myeloid leukemia cells. A dose-finding phase 1 clinical trial was performed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with further assessment of safety and tolerability. Methods: Forty-two patients with relapsed/refractory AML/MDS received lurbinectedin administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion in a 3+3 study design. Two dosing schedules were used: 3.5 mg, 5 mg, 7 mg, or 6 mg on days 1 and 8 or 2 mg, 3 mg, 1 mg, or 1.5 mg for 3 consecutive days on days 1 to 3. Patients 18 years or older with a diagnosis of advanced, relapsed/refractory AML (non-acute promyelocytic leukemia) and MDS were eligible and treated on study. Eligible patients had adequate hepatic, renal, and cardiac function and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2. Patients with uncontrolled infection, human immunodeficiency virus, cardiac and neurological disorders, or those who were pregnant were ineligible. Clinical trial information: NCT01314599. Results: Three patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities of rhabdomyolysis (grade 4), hyperbilirubinemia (grade 3), and oral herpes (grade 3) with the days 1 and 8 schedule. Otherwise, adverse events mainly consisted of gastrointestinal manifestations (n=11), febrile neutropenia/infections (n=4), pulmonary toxicity (n=2), and renal failure (n=2). The most common laboratory abnormalities observed were an increase in creatinine (93%) and anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia (100%). Overall, 33 of 42 patients (79%) had reduction in blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow. One patient achieved a partial response and two patients a morphologic leukemia-free state. Most (n=30, 71%) were discontinued due to progressive disease. Early deaths occurred from disease-related causes that were not attributable to lurbinectedin. Four patients with a chromosome 11q21-23 abnormality had significantly greater bone marrow blast reduction than those without such abnormality, with decrease of 31\u00b114% (n=4) vs. 8\u00b18% (n=16), respectively ( P =0.04). Conclusions: Overall, lurbinectedin was safe and tolerated using the schedules and dose levels tested. While no sustained remissions were observed, single-agent lurbinectedin was transiently leukemia suppressive for some patients. Disclosures Rodr\u00edguez: PharmaMar: Employment.
