    "abstract_text": "In the homocysteine metabolic pathway, several key enzymes, including methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR), have been implicated in abnormal homocysteine accumulation in the presence of rare alleles. In previous study, we showed that lower maternal Cbl levels were associated with higher tHcy and lower S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio in pregnant women and their neonates.The aim of this study is to investigate whether MTHFR and MTRR polymorphisms are involved in the risk for elevated total homocysteine (tHcy) and its interaction with low cobalamin (Cbl) or serum folate (SF) levels. Genotypes for polymorphisms MTHFR C677T and MTRR A66G were determined by PCR-FLRP. The serum levels of Cbl, SF and tHcy were determined in 377 pregnant women (37\u201342 weeks of gestational age), and cutoff values for Cbl and SF were considered the first quartile (low values). Four models of univariate logistic regression analyses were used (Table 1). Pregnant women with MTHFR 677T allele have high risk for elevated tHcy that is increased when 677T allele is associated with low Cbl. Increased risk for elevated tHcy is also met when MTRR 66G allele and low Cbl levels were associated. Women with low SF and common MTHFR and MTRR alleles have high risk for elevated tHcy, that is increased when in association with 677T allele or with 66G allele.
