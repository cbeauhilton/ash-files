    "abstract_text": "CD38 expression is a marker of poor prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) but to-date no clear rationale for this has been elucidated. Using high speed cell sorting and subsequent gene expression profiling, we investigated the transcriptional characteristics of purified CD38 + and CD38 \u2212 sub-clones derived from the same patient (n = 12). Our analysis revealed a distinct, differential gene expression profile between CD38 + and CD38 \u2212 subsets with 35 genes found to be consistently over expressed in the CD38 + cells (of which CD38 was one; 9.1 fold). Of particular interest were four genes, CXCL-2 (9.4 fold), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (5.8 fold), MIP1\u03b1 /CCL3 (5.4 fold) and Interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2 ) (4.1 fold). In a number of different tumor models IL-1\u03b2 has been shown to induce the expression of CXCL-2, VEGF, and MIP1\u03b1 resulting in angiogenesis, survival signaling and/or tumor proliferation. Protein analysis revealed 2\u20133 fold elevated levels of IL-1\u03b2 and VEGF in CD38 + cells confirming that the elevated transcription was translated. Furthermore, the differential transcription of these genes corroborates our previous findings; CD38 + cells have a higher proliferative index and higher levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. Our data strongly suggests that the CD38 + clones preferentially utilise an autocrine VEGF loop and given that the CD38 \u2212 clones also express VEGF receptor the potential for bystander paracrine effects of secreted VEGF seem likely in bimodal patients. Therefore, the relative over expression of IL-1\u03b2 and VEGF provide a rationale for the disease progression and poor clinical prognosis of CD38 + CLL patients.",
