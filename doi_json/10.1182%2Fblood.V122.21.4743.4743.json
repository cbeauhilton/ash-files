    "abstract_text": "Contrary to most animals which are capable of obtaining ascorbic acid (vitamin C) by metabolizing glucose, humans require an exogenous source of vitamin C. It is a water-soluble vitamin found in various foods, including citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, grapefruit), green vegetables (peppers, broccoli, cabbage), tomatoes, and potatoes. It is essential for growth and repair of tissues, particularly blood vessels. Deficiency of vitamin C is relatively rare; the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988-1994) found approximately 13% of the US population to be vitamin C deficient. Smoking cigarettes lowers the amount of vitamin C in the body, so smokers are at a higher risk of deficiency. Additionally, alcoholics, the elderly, patients with psychiatric disorders and individuals who experience social isolation are also at risk. Symptoms can manifest after 3 months of deficient intake of vitamin C -containing foods. Since ascorbic acid is required for collagen synthesis, deficiency usually manifests with bleeding gums, ecchymoses, petechiae, coiled hairs and hyperkeratosis. Diagnosis can be established when plasma levels of vitamin C fall below 0.2mg/dl. There are currently no evidence based guidelines for supplementation once low levels are detected. We describe a case of a 33 year old Caucasian female seen in our clinic for easy bruising of 10 years duration. She would wake up in the morning with bruised arms and legs without any inciting trauma. She denied prolonged bleeding after dental extractions, frequent nose bleeds, menorrhagia any genitounrinary or gastrointestinal blood loss. Her exam revealed ecchymoses on her arms and legs with no evidence of perifollicular hemorrhage or gingival hyperplasia. Workup including CBC, Coagulation profile and Von Willibrand factor levels were all within normal limits. She had a vitamin C level of 0.1mg/dl. She was subsequently advised to increase vitamin C intake through fruits and vegetable and was started on vitamin C supplementation with 500mg twice a day for four weeks. Her repeat vitamin C level on her one month follow up was noted to be 1.9mg/dl. She noticed complete resolution of her symptoms. This case illustrates the fact that vitamin C deficiency should be excluded in adults presenting with bruising. It also offers a supplementation regimen that resulted in improvement of clinical symptoms as well as laboratory value normalization. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
