    "abstract_text": "Latent CMV infection is controlled by a limited repertoire of immunodominant T-cells specific for viral peptides, particularly CMVpp65 and CMV IE-1. The antigen-specific T-cell subsets responsible for maintaining memory T-cells in this repertoire and repopulating them in response to periodic viral reactivations remain unclear. In this study, we generated T-cells specific for CMVpp65 from na\u00efve (T N ), T SCM , T CM and T EM subsets isolated from the blood of HLA-A*0201 normal seropositive donors and then comparatively characterized NLV-HLA-A*0201 Tetramer + T-cells from each of these subsets. Following in vitro sensitization with artificial antigen-presenting cells transduced to express HLA-A*0201 and CMVpp65 and expansion with IL-7, IL-15 and IL-2, Tet + T-cells were regularly generated from CD62L + CD45RO - CD95 - T N and from CD62L + CD45RO - CD95 + T SCM , as well as T CM and T EM . Isolated Tet + T N , T SCM , T CM and T EM were each able to generate IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and granzyme B. Each Tet + subset also expressed similar level of PD-1 and KLRG-1. However, Tet + T N and T SCM expressed higher levels of CD27 and lower levels of CD57 than T CM or T EM . Tet + T SCM were distinguished from Tet + T N , T CM and T EM by a significantly greater level of proliferation and by their rapid and selective expansion of NLV-specific T-cells bearing TCRs identical by amino acid sequences to those expressed by T EM and T CM in the blood. Thus, Tet + T SCM rather than Tet + T N constitute the principal repertoire for repopulation of immunodominant memory T-cells sustained in the circulation.
