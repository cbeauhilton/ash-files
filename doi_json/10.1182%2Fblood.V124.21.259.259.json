    "abstract_text": "Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) is an RNA and DNA binding protein that regulates critical pathways controlling differentiation and proliferation programs. While alterations in hnRNP K expression are associated with neoplastic malignancies, we currently do not understand how changes in hnRNP K expression contribute to tumor phenotypes in vivo . Previous biochemical and cell line studies demonstrate that hnRNP K transcriptionally regulates p53-dependent activities, suggesting it functions as a potential tumor suppressor. However, hnRNP K has also been shown to positively regulate c-Myc expression, indicating it may behave as an oncogene. The HNRNP K gene maps to a region of chromosome 9 (9q21.32), which is lost in a subset of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RNA expression analyses of patient samples with AML that harbor 9q21.32 deletions revealed a significant reduction in HNRNP K expression compared to wild type control samples, supporting the notion that hnRNP K acts as a tumor suppressor ( Figure 1 A). However, patients with AML who do not harbor a 9q21.32 deletion displayed a significant increase in hnRNP K expression ( Figure 1 A). Thus, to examine the association between altered hnRNP K expression and disease status in patients with AML, we performed reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis on CD34+ bone marrow cells from 415 de novo AML patient as well as healthy donor controls. Interestingly, we observed a significant correlation between elevated hnRNP K levels and poor outcomes, which supports the idea that hnRNP K has oncogenic potential ( Figure 1 A). Together, these observations indicate that any change in hnRNP K expression may contribute to the etiology of AML and supports the idea that hnRNP K may potentially act as either a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor or oncogene in AML. To directly interrogate these possibilities in vivo , we generated mouse models that either harbor a deletion of one hnRNP K allele ( hnRNP K +/ - ) or overexpressed hnRNP K ( hnRNP K Tg ) in the hematological compartment. Western blot analyses demonstrated that hnRNP K haploinsufficiency results in a significant reduction in hnRNP K expression while tissue-specific activation of hnRNP K resulted in overexpression of hnRNP K. Similar to our observation in AML patients, either hnRNP K haploinsufficiency or overexpression resulted in similar phenotypes in vitro and in vivo . Lin-CD117+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from hnRNP K +/ - and hnRNP K Tg mice had significant increases in differentiation and proliferation potential as determined by colony formation assays. In these experiments, we observed a significant increase in the number of total colonies and number of cells per colony in both hnRNP K +/ - and hnRNP K Tg HSCs as compared to wild type HSCs ( Figure 1 B). In vivo analyses of the hnRNP K +/ - and hnRNP K Tg mice revealed a significant increase in myeloid hyperplasia in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, increased tumor formation, genomic instability, and decreased survival compared to wild type mice ( Figure 1 C). Interestingly, both increased and decreased hnRNP K expression resulted in alterations in similar pathways that regulate differentiation and proliferations potential (e.g.; p53 and c-Myc pathways and alterations in C/EBP expression). Together, these clinical and animal model studies illustrate that either over-expression or under-expression of hnRNP K lead to strikingly similar phenotypes that directly impact the etiology of AML. Furthermore, these data not only implicate that hnRNP K behaves as both a tumor suppressor and oncogene, but also suggest that it functions as a master toggle that dictates the proliferation and differentiation potential of HSCs. We are currently using Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing (RNA-Seq) and ChIP-Seq to evaluate the mechanisms by which increased and decreased hnRNP K expression impact hematologic malignancies.
