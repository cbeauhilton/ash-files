    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3438 Background: The standard of care for most patients (pts) with CML has been imatinib mesylate at a dose of 400mg by mouth daily. Earlier studies have suggested that there may be a benefit to pts to start treatment at a higher dose as this may result in faster and more durable responses to imatinib. It is not yet known whether long-term event-free survival (EFS), transformation-free survival (TFS), and overall survival (OS) will be impacted by the higher dosing schedule. Objectives: To determine the long term responses and clinical benefit of imatinib 800mg daily versus 400mg daily dosing when used as upfront treatment strategy in CML. Methods: We conducted sequential prospective trials using imatinib 400mg or 800mg daily as initial therapy for patients with previously untreated chronic phase CML. Results: A total of 281 pts were included in these trials: 208 treated with 800mg and 73 with 400mg. The median follow-up for each group was 79 months (range: 3\u2013107) and 110 months (range: 2\u2013116). The overall, cumulative rate of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) was 91% and 87%, respectively (p=0.49) for those treated with high- and standard-dose, and the cumulative rate of major molecular response (MMR) was 87% and 78%, respectively (p=0.06). Rates of CCyR at 12 months were 90% and 66%, respectively (p < 0.001), and MMR at 18 months 82% and 68%, respectively (p=0.04). A significantly better EFS (definition per IRIS criteria) was observed for the 800 mg group compared to that in the 400mg group (log-rank test, p=0.049; estimated 7-year EFS 86% vs 76% by Kaplan-Meier method). No significant differences were seen for survival free from transformation to accelerated and blast phase (p = 0.46) and overall survival (p = 0.27). For OS, thus far 19 pts in the 800mg group have died (2 probable CML-related, 3 unknown causes, 14 non CML related) compared to 13 pts (10 probable CML-related, 3 non CML-related) in the 400mg group.

Conclusions: At 7-year follow up, pts treated with 800mg demonstrated a significantly better EFS (by IRIS criteria) compared to those treated with 400mg. There is a trend for a lower annual rate of events and transformation with the higher dose, particualry in the earlier years, but no difference in OS. These results suggest a modest benefit for patients treated with higher dose imatinib. Disclosures: Off Label Use: imatinib at dose of 800mg po daily for CML.
