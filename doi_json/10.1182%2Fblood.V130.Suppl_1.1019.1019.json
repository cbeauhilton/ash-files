    "abstract_text": "Lateral transmembrane (TM) helix-helix associations play essential roles in membrane-protein folding, assembly, and signal transduction. Thus, dissociation of the TM helices of resting integrins is central to integrin activation. Atomic-level models have revealed that a small residue-X 3 -small residue motif G-x 3 -G mediates the interaction of \u03b1IIb TM helix with \u03b23, whereas a reciprocating large residue-small residue motif V-x 3 -I-x 3 -G mediates the interaction of the \u03b23 helix with \u03b1IIb. Platelets contain a second \u03b23 integrin \u03b1v\u03b23. Like \u03b1II\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b23 on resting platelets is inactive until platelets are stimulated by agonists such as ADP and thrombin after which it is able to interact with immobilized ligands such as osteopontin (OPN) and vitronectin. It is noteworthy that besides a V-x 3 -I-x 3 -G motif, the \u03b23 TM domain contains the small residue-X 3 -small residue motif, S-x 3 -A and a small residue-X 3 -small residue motif in the \u03b27 TM domain mediates its association with \u03b14. Accordingly, we asked whether the motifs mediating the interaction of the \u03b23 TM domain with the TM domains of \u03b1IIb and \u03b1v are necessarily the same. To address this question, we scanned the TM helix of intact \u03b23 with leucine and alanine replacements, stably co-expressed the \u03b23 mutants with wild-type human \u03b1v in CHO cells, and used optical trap-based force spectroscopy to measure the constitutive interaction of \u03b1v\u03b23 with either immobilized OPN or the activation-dependent \u03b1v\u03b23-specific monoclonal antibody WOW-1 (a kind gift from Dr. Sanford Shattil). The latter method measures the probability of receptor-ligand binding and the forces required to rupture single receptor-ligand bonds. Initially, we measured the interaction of wild-type (WT) \u03b1v\u03b23 in its low-affinity state with OPN. The majority of measured rupture forces were in the range of 0-40 pN with a cumulative probability of detecting meaningful rupture forces >10 pN of only 1.1\u00b10.7%. However, when \u03b1v\u03b23 was shifted to its high-affinity state by 1 mM Mn 2+ , the range of rupture forces increased up to 100 pN with a peak in the force spectrum at 45-50 pN and a cumulative probability of detecting rupture forces >10 pN of 3.1\u00b11.3%. We then scanned the \u03b23 TM domain with leucine and alanine residues and found a periodic increase in the cumulative probability of constitutive OPN binding that was comparable to Mn 2+ -stimulated WT binding and with probability peaks at S699L, A703L, and I707L. To confirm the latter result, we replaced OPN with WOW-1. Again, there was a periodic increase in the cumulative probability of constitutive WOW-1 binding with peaks at S669L, V700A, A703L, I704L, I707L, and G708L. Thus, in contrast to \u03b1IIb\u03b23, these data indicate that the \u03b23 TM domain associates with the \u03b1v TM domain via its S-x 3 -A motif. To investigate the structure of the \u03b1v\u03b23 TM complex, we built a molecular model for the \u03b1v\u03b23 TM and cytoplasmic domains from an \u03b1IIb\u03b23 NMR model by threading the aligned \u03b1v sequence onto \u03b1IIb. The model was then subjected to cycles of minimization and rotamer optimization using the Rosetta modeling suite. The resulting structures deviated from the TM domain interface used by \u03b1IIb\u03b23, suggesting it is not favorable for \u03b1v\u03b23. Next, to investigate the preferred interface of the \u03b1v\u03b23 TM helices, we used the lowest energy model to build an all-atom water-lipid-protein system and then conducted unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. For the majority of these simulations, the helices were tightly associated and maintained a relatively uniform conformation. While the dimer complex was stable, the orientation of the \u03b1v and \u03b23 TM helices rapidly equilibrated to the small residue-X 3 -small residue heterodimer interface. No additional forces were applied to this system to bias the formation of helical geometries. Strikingly, the \u03b1v\u03b23 interface observed throughout the simulation correlated well with the helical face suggested by the optical force spectroscopy experiments. In conclusion, we found that compared to \u03b1IIb\u03b23, there is a clear shift in the helical register and periodicity of the \u03b1v\u03b23 TM heterodimer such that both the \u03b1v and \u03b23 helices interacted via small residue-X 3 -small residue motifs. Subsequent molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations were consistent with the results of the scanning mutagenesis experiments. Thus, these studies provide insight into how unique but homologous integrins regulate signal activation across diverse biological processes.
