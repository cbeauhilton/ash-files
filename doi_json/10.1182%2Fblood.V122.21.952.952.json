    "abstract_text": "To function effectively in O 2 uptake, transport and delivery, erythrocytes rely on sophisticated regulation of hemoglobin (Hb)-O 2 affinity by endogenous allosteric modulators. One of the best know allosteric modulators is 2,3-bisphophosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), a metabolic byproduct of glycolysis synthesized primarily in erythrocytes for the purpose of regulating Hb-O 2 affinity. Earlier studies demonstrated that erythrocyte 2,3-BPG levels are elevated at a high altitude and in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). We have recently shown that adenosine, a molecule well known to be induced under hypoxic conditions, is significantly elevated in SCD and contributes to increased 2,3-BPG induction in SCD erythrocytes. However, whether adenosine contributes to increased erythrocyte 2,3-BPG production at high altitude is unknown. To address this question we recruited 24 individuals who normally lived at sea level, and placed them at high altitude for different time points. Similarly, blood was collected from 45 SCD patients and 50 controls (at sea level). Here we report that 1) Plasma adenosine and erythrocyte 2,3-BPG levels were significantly elevated in normal individuals at high altitude after 24 hours compared to sea level; 2) The elevations of both molecules are further enhanced at high altitude after 16 days; 3) Elevated circulating adenosine levels significantly correlated with increased erythrocyte 2,3-DPG levels in normal individuals at high altitude and in SCD patients. These results suggest that adenosine is a common factor responsible for elevated 2,3-BPG as a function in normal individuals and in SCD patients. To test this hypothesis we took pharmacologic and genetic approaches. We found that NECA, a stable adenosine analog, significantly increased 2,3-BPG production in cultured erythrocytes from normal and SCD mice and humans. Additional genetic and pharmacologic experiment showed that adenosine-induced 2,3-BPG production was mediated by ADORA2B receptor activation and downstream signaling by protein kinase A. To examine the in vivo physiological relevance of our findings we used adenosine deaminase (ADA)-deficient mice that accumulate high levels of circulating adenosine as a result of their enzyme deficiency. We found that elevated adenosine correlated to elevated erythrocyte 2,3-BPG and decreased Hb-O 2 affinity. Experimental strategies to lower plasma adenosine or inhibit ADORA2B signaling in ADA-deficient mice resulted in reduced 2,3-BPG production and increased Hb-O 2 affinity in erythrocytes. These studies provide in vivo evidence that elevated adenosine signaling via ADORA2B contributes to elevated of 2,3-BPG production and thereby triggers O 2 release from erythrocytes. Taken together, our studies show that adenosine is a common factor regulating erythrocyte 2,3-BPG induction as a function of altitude and in patients with sickle cell disease. Our studies reveal numerous approaches to enhance oxygen release from oxyHb to physiologically or environmentally induced conditions of hypoxia.
