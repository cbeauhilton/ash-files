    "abstract_text": "T is a Farnesyltransferase inhibitor with clinical activity in elderly adults with newly diagnosed AML who are not candidates for TCC. For adults \u2265 age 65 with poor-risk AML, T 600 mg BID for 21 out of every 28\u201363 days induces complete remissions (CR) in 15%, median duration 7.3 mos, median survival 18 mos. In vitro, T+E exhibits synergistic anti-AML effects. In an attempt to increase CR rates in elderly AML pts, we are conducting a Phase I trial of oral T+E, with escalating doses of both drugs and 14 vs. 21 days of T every 28\u201363 days (median time to beginning cycle 2 is Day 31, range 29\u201343). To date, 60 adults \u2265 age 70 (median 77, range 71\u201391) have been treated at 10 dose levels of T (300, 400 or 600 mg BID, 14 or 21 days) + E (100, 150 or 200 mg daily days 1\u20133 and 8\u201310) and have received 145 cycles (median 3, range 1\u20137). A total of 35 (58%) have had secondary AML and 31 (52%) have had adverse cytogenetics. Marrow blast percent was median 55% (range 20\u201396%), with 75% >30,000 blasts. Nonhematologic toxicities include oropharyngeal mucositis (15% \u2265 grade 2), CNS (overall 30%, with 80% of those \u2264 grade 2), renal (6%), hyperbilirubinemia (6%), rash (20%) and fatigue (20%). Toxicities occurred across all T+E dose levels tested to date. Documented infections occurred in 16 (27%) pts during cycle 1 and 22/145 (14%) cycles. Twenty six pts (43%) required hospitalization during cycle 1 for median 7 days (range 2\u201328). Overall hospitalization rate for all cycles was 28% (41/145). Ten pts (17%) died on study: 6 during cycle 1 (4 infection, 1 emphysema, 1 cerebrovascular) and 4 during cycles 2\u20134 (3 acute myocardial infarctions, 1 ventricular arrhythmia). For 56 evaluable pts, 12 (21%) have achieved CR and 11(20%) have achieved partial remission/hematologic improvement (PR/HI). All pts achieving CR have done so within 2 cycles (9/12 after cycle 1). Eight of 30 pts (27%) receiving T \u2265 400 mg BID have achieved CR. Median age of CR pts is 79 (range 71\u201386), 8 (67%) have secondary AML, and 5 (42%) have complex cytogenetics. CR durations to date range from 2+ to 13.5+ mos, with median 7+ months. Three of 12 have relapsed at 3, 10, and 11 mos, 2 have been retreated with T+E, and both have achieved 2 nd CRs. In sum, the oral regimen of T+E is tolerable and feasible on an outpatient basis for elderly adults with newly diagnosed AML who are not candidates for TCC, with the suggestion of improvement of CR rates over T alone."
