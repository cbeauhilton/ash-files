    "abstract_text": "Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) characterized by the presence of JAK2 V617F mutation in >95% and 60% of patients (pts), respectively. This mutation usually affects one allele in ET while most PV pts are homozygous due to mitotic recombination. Acquisition of the JAK2 V617F mutation is strongly associated with the germline 46/1 predisposition haplotype. Ruxolitinib is a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor recently approved for myelofibrosis (MF) and under investigation in PV and ET pts intolerant or resistant to hydroxyurea. We enrolled 24 pts, 11 with PV and 13 with ET, in the phase II INCB18424-256 trial that overall included 34 PV and 39 ET pts. 21/24 pts were still on treatment at 5 years (yr), of which 19 JAK2 V617F mutated. Results of the PV cohort have been reported recently (Verstovsek et al. Cancer, 2014): with a median follow up of 35 months (mo), the JAK2 V617F allele burden decreased by a mean of 8%, 14%, and 22%, respectively, after 12, 24 and 36 mo. The proportion of pts who achieved a reduction \u226550 % at any time during the 1st yr, 2nd yr, and 3rd yr were 5.9%, 14.7%, and 23.5%, respectively, but no patients achieved a complete remission. In our series of pts we evaluated the JAK2 V617F allele burden by two RTQ-PCR methods, according to Lippert (sensitivity, 0.8%) and to Larsen (sensitivity, 0.08%) method. We also analysed by next generation sequencing (NGS; Ion Torrent platform) a series of MPN-associated mutations including TET2, ASXL1, IDH1/2, LNK, CBL, SRSF2, EZH2 and MPL at baseline and at 5 yr of treatment in ruxolitinib treated pts who achieved a >25% JAK2 V617F allele burden reduction at 5 yr (n=13/19). JAK2 V617F allele burden decreased by a mean of 7%, 11%, and 19% at 12, 24 and 36 mo, and decreased further by a mean of 28% after 60 mo. Three (1 PV, 2 ET) of 19 pts (16%) achieved a 50% or greater allele burden reduction after 2 yr; no additional pts achieved this degree of allele burden reduction even in prolonged follow up. These 3 pts further improved their molecular response to a complete molecular response (CMR) after 5 yr of treatment. Their mean JAK2 V617F allele burden was 46.6% at baseline, 28.3%, 16.3%, 8.7% and 0% after 1 yr, 2 yr, 3 yr and 5 yr, respectively. The JAK2 CMR was confirmed in at least one independent sample at 3 mo after first discovery. At this last timepoint, the PV pt was in complete haematological remission according to ELN criteria, the 2 ET pts were in partial remission due to platelet count still >400x10 9 /L: 422x10 9 /L and 812x10 9 /L, respectively. BM histopathology in the 2 ET pts at 5 yr, while they were in CMR, showed still evidence of megakaryocyte hyperplasia. In the PV pt, histopathology at 5 yr is pending; evaluation at 3 yr, a time when she was in complete hematologic remission and JAK allele burden had decreased from 69 to 8%, showed normalization of cellularity, megakaryocyte and myeloid lineage compared to baseline but still slight erythroid hyperplasia. All 3 pts had normal karyotype at baseline that remained unchanged thereafter. CMR for JAK2 V617F was confirmed by NGS. The 2 ET pts achieving CMR did not show any additional mutations, while the PV pts presented a TET2 Y867H mutation with an allele burden of 48.9% and 52%, respectively at baseline and 5 yr. No recurrent mutations in genes other than JAK2 were found in all other examined cases at baseline or at 5 yr. In 3 informative pts, we also analysed the proportion of JAK2 V617F homozygous, heterozygous and wild type clones by the method of Hasan et al (Leukemia 2013) based on allelic discrimination of 46/1 haplotype and JAK2 . We found that JAK2 V617F/V617F clones were reduced by a mean of 95.5%, JAK2 V617F/WT showed an uneven trend with a mean reduction of 45.54% while JAK2 WT/WT conversely increased (mean 61.43%) at 5 yr, suggesting that in a subset a patients who present significant reduction of VF allele burden ruxolitinib may preferentially target the homozygous clones. Until now, complete molecular remission in PV pts has been described only in patients treated with interferon. Our data suggest that a subset of pts who present a rapid and sustained reduction of the JAK2 V617F allele burden under ruxolitinib may eventually reach a condition of CMR with prolonged treatment. However, similar to findings with interferon, mutations establishing clonality, such as in TET2 , may still persist in patients who eventually show the disappearance of JAK2 V617F mutated subclones.
