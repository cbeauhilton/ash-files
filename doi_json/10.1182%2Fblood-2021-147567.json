    "abstract_text": "Background: Patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after prior autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy have poor outcomes with limited treatment options. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors are safe and effective agents in subsets of DLBCL with chronic active B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, but durations of remission are short. Acalabrutinib, a highly selective, covalent, potent next-generation inhibitor of BTK (Calquence \u00ae prescribing information [USPI]), is approved for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and is being explored in combination with other rational targeted agents in DLBCL. High levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) expression and activation have been preferentially detected in activated B-cell DLBCL (Ding et al, 2008), and inhibition of STAT3 has suppressed DLBCL in preclinical models (Scuto et al, 2011). A phase 1b study demonstrated the safety and tolerability of AZD9150 in DLBCL with some evidence of clinical activity including 2 complete responses (CRs) and 2 partial responses (PRs) in 27 patients (Reilley et al, 2018). We report results from one of the arms of a phase 1 master protocol PRISM study (NCT03527147: A Platform Protocol for the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma), which evaluated combination therapy of acalabrutinib with the anti-STAT3 allele-specific oligonucleotide AZD9150 in patients with R/R DLBCL. Methods: Study participants were patients with R/R DLBCL aged \u226518 years with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status \u22642 and after \u22651 line of prior chemo-immunotherapy (including patients failing or ineligible for ASCT or CAR-T therapy). Starting on cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1), acalabrutinib was administered at 100 mg twice daily until disease progression or discontinuation. AZD9150 200 mg was administered as a 1-hour intravenous (IV) infusion on D1, D3, and D5 of C1, followed by weekly infusions (starting D8C1 and beyond). The primary endpoint was safety, and there was a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) analysis after 6 subjects completed D28. Disease response (secondary endpoint) was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Lymphoma 2017. Exploratory analyses included longitudinal peripheral blood and tumor tissue samples including immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and gene expression from total blood RNA (using the Nanostring - PanCancer IO 360\u2122 Panel). Molecular classification at baseline was explored using available tumor tissue samples by LymphGen classification (Wright et al, 2020). Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis was conducted using whole gene sequencing and a custom next-generation sequencing panel (AZHeme 600; Collins GP et al, 2021) and correlated with clinical response. Results: A total of 17 patients were enrolled; median age was 72 (range, 34-88) years and 47% (8/17) of patients were \u226575 years. Median number of prior lines of therapy was 2 (range, 1-6). Overall response rate was 24% with a CR rate of 12%. The most commonly reported adverse events (\u226525%) of any grade independent of study drug attribution were anemia, AST/ALT elevation, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and fatigue. One DLT of grade 3 AST/ALT increase was observed, and there were no treatment-related deaths. Total cell-free DNA (cfDNA) levels and the allele frequency of mutations within ctDNA correlated with treatment response. One patient achieved an early CR to therapy after C2 (Figure 1A), which correlated with dynamic changes in ctDNA (Figure 1B) including the disappearance of copy number changes (Figure 1C). Patients with persistent copy number changes detected (\u22651 alteration) as early as C1D8 were less likely to respond to acalabrutinib in combination with AZD9150. Cell of origin phenotype of DLBCL or genetic subtype did not correlate with response. The pharmacokinetics of acalabrutinib, ACP-5862 (active metabolite of acalabrutinib), and AZD9150 were generally consistent with historical monotherapy profiles. Conclusions : Targeting BTK and STAT3 is safe and tolerable in relapsed DLBCL but has limited efficacy. Early clearance of copy number variations and decreased cfDNA levels were associated with clinical responses and may be a useful biomarker with targeted agents.
