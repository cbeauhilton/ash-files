    "abstract_text": "The concerted action of hematopoiesis supporting cytokines such as G-CSF, GM-CSF or IL-6 regulates hematopoiesis during steady state and emergency situations. Respective knockout mice show defects both in production and function of myelopoietic effector cells. However, alternative pathways are likely to exist as mice with single or combined deficiencies for G-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-6 or G-CSF and GM-CSF are still able to mount reactive neutrophilia responses during inflammatory conditions. In order to identify pathways for inflammation induced enhancement of hematopoiesis as well as to find new cytokines, which enhance myeloid cell regeneration, we analyzed the bone marrow (BM) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and vehicle injected wild type (WT) mice (single IP- injection) by gene expression microarray. Focusing on the identification of genes encoding for secreted or membrane proteins, we found 83 candidates to be up- and 14 to be downregulated after LPS treatment. Among known candiates, we found angiopoietin-like 4 (Angptl-4) as a predominantly upregulated gene in the BM of LPS-treated WT-mice. Upregulation was confirmed by RT-PCR as well as by Elisa in the BM of LPS treated mice and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) were identified as candidate producer cells. Functionally, we found recombinant Angptl-4 to stimulate the proliferation of myeloid colony-forming units (CFU) in vitro. In mice, repeated injections of Angptl-4 increased BM progenitor cell frequency and this was paralleled by a relative increase in phenotypically defined granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs). Furthermore, in vivo treatment with Angptl-4 resulted in elevated platelet counts both in untreated animals and after myelosuppressive therapy. After lethal irradiation and transplantation of syngeneic BM cells repetitive injections of recombinant Angptl-4 for 5 consecutive days resulted in an accelerated reconstitution of platelets starting at day 8 after transplantation. The 50% pre-treatment platelet count was reached on day 14 in Angptl-4-treated animals as compared to day 21 for transplanted controls receiving no Angptl-4 (n=8; p=0.03, student\u00b4s T test). In contrast, transplantation of BM cells from Angptl-4 pre-treated donor mice had no effect on the recovery of platelets in this setting. The frequency of CD41 low CD61 + immature megakaryocytes was significantly increased in the BM of Angptl-4 injected as compared to control mice (27% vs 19% of total megakaryocytes; p= 0.008, student\u00b4s T test). Furthermore, bone marrow cytology revealed local accumulation of megakaryocytes carrying dysplastic features in Angptl-4 injected mice. In summary, our data suggest that Angptl-4 plays a complementary role on hematopoiesis during emergency situations like sepsis. The use of Angptl-4 in the setting of autologous stem cell transplantation could represent a potential approach to accelerate the reconstitution of megakaryopoiesis.
