    "abstract_text": "The enzyme \u03b2-1-4 galactosyltransferase 1 (\u03b24GalT1) plays a critical role in thrombopoiesis by modulating sialo-glycan (sialyl N-acetyl-lactosamine or LacNAc) content and function of the \u03b21 integrin on megakaryocytes (MKs) (Nat. Commun. 2020;11(1):356). Recent data, however, point to a more complex role for \u03b24GalT1 in hematopoiesis, as the promoter region of its conserved gene, B4galt1 , is rich in enhancer sequences for transcription factors associated with cell identity and pro-oncogenic regulatory programs. Here, we investigated the homeostasis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in B4galt1 -/- mice . We demonstrate that lack of Sialylated LacNAc synthesis perturbs HSPCs beyond the homing deficiency associated with lack of homing sialo-glycan motifs. Flow cytometry analysis showed that B4galt1 -/- mouse bone marrows have increased numbers of Long-Term HSCs (LT-HSCs, defined as Lineage Neg /Sca-1 Pos /c-Kit Pos /CD150 Pos /CD48 Neg ). The increase in HSC numbers led us to investigate their phenotypic and functional features further. While quiescence markers in B4galt1 -/- LT-HSCs were indistinguishable relative to controls, LT-HSCs expressed more of the platelet marker CD41 on their surface, supporting a highly expanded CD41 + subset of LT-HSCs. Platelet-bias of LT-HSCs has been associated with inflammation and aging. However, our data do not support an increased cytokine inflammatory profile in the bone marrow. Instead, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) of sorted \u03b2 4galt1 -/- Lineage Neg /Sca-1 Pos /c-Kit Pos (LSK) cells showed a significantly increased expression of the proto-oncogene Pim-1, its target, Myc, and the heavily O-glycosylated transmembrane receptor mucin 13 ( MUC13 ), compared to control cells. Analysis of LT-HSC glycan expression using lectin microarray showed the expected decrease in N-glycosylation associated with B4galt1 deficiency, but also an increase in O-glycans, consistent with overexpression of MUC13, expression of which was enriched compared to other surface mucins. The data show that B4galt1 deletion leads to overexpression of the proto-oncogenes Pim-1, Myc, and MUC13 in HSPCs. The data suggest that MUC13-associated O-glycans and glyco-synthetic genes are potential therapeutic targets for hematologic malignancies since mucins have anti-inflammatory functions and alterations in mucin expression are with inflammation and cancer.
