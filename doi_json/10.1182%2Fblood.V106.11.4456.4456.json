    "abstract_text": "The introduction of ATRA-based differentiation therapy has significantly enhanced outcomes in patients with APL. However, retinoic acid syndrome and ATRA-resistance remain significant concerns. It would therefore be useful to develop drugs that reduce the therapeutic doses of ATRA needed, and would be effective in ATRA-resistant cases. We have shown previously that curcumin, the yellow compound isolated from spice turmeric, suppresses the initiation and promotion stages of cancer development. In the present study we evaluated whether curcumin affects differentiation of NB4 APL cells. The NB4 cells were derived from a patient with APL, and differentiate in response to ATRA, while NB4-R1 cells are resistant to ATRA. Treatment of NB4 cells with 5 \u03bcM curcumin enhanced ATRA-mediated differentiation. Differentiation was assessed by evaluating CD11b expression, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction and by morphologic examination. This curumin-mediated enhanced differentiation was apparent at 1 \u03bcM as well as 0.1 \u03bcM of ATRA. Curcumin alone did not cause differentiation of the NB4 cells, although higher concentrations of curcumin caused apoptosis. We then examined the effect of curcumin on the ATRA-resistant NB-R1 cells. Addition of ATRA and curcumin together induced differentiation of the NB4-R1 cells, whereas either agent alone did not cause differentiation. The differentiation was characterized by increased CD11b expression, NBT reduction and the typical morphologic changes. In addition, differentiation of the NB4-R1 cells was accompanied by restoration of the PML-oncogenic domains (PODs). These results indicate that curcumin may be another unconventional therapeutic agent in APL, following the successful use of ATRA and arsenic trioxide."
