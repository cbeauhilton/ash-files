    "abstract_text": "The PI3K/Akt pathway is dysregulated is some acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) and might therefore serve as therapeutic target. Indolylmaleimides exhibit inhibitory potencies against different protein kinases -like glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3\u03b2) or protein kinase c- influencing thereby several cellular processes. Recently, it was demonstrated that PDA-66, a newly synthesized indolylmalemide based on the well known GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor SB-216763, hinders microtubule polymerization in human neuronal progenitor and neuroblastoma cells. GSK3\u03b2 is a downstream substrate of the PI3K/Akt and Wnt pathways and is often deregulated in tumor tissues. Herein, we investigated the effects of PDA-66 and its derivates (PDA-66E und PDA-377) on B and T-lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Methods B- and T-ALL cell lines (SEM, RS4;11, REH, Jurkat, MOLT-4 and CEM) were incubated for 72\u00a0h with increasing concentrations (0.1 \u00b5M-5.0 \u00b5M) of PDA-66, PDA-66E, PDA-377 and comparatively analyzed to SB-216763. To evaluate the effect of each substance WST-1 assay, cell proliferation, cell cycle analyses as well as apoptosis rates were determined. Activities of indolylmalemides were analyzed by GSK3\u03b2 kinase assay. Detection of key molecules of Wnt and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was performed using Western blot. Results PDA-66 and derivates inhibited proliferation and metabolism of ALL cells significantly in a dose dependent manner. Interestingly, all PDA derivates showed a stronger inhibitory effect on proliferation than SB-216763 but the inhibitory effect on GSK3\u03b2 kinase was lower than SB-216763. Antiproliferative effects of PDA-66 were studied in more detail. The incubation of 1\u00a0\u00b5M PDA-66 led to condensation of chromatin in the nucleus, karyorrhexis and an increasing amount of vacuoles after 48\u00a0h of treatment. PDA-66 influenced the cell cycle distribution of ALL cell lines differently. While RS4;11 and MOLT-4 cells were arrested in G2 phase, SEM cells remained increasingly in G0/1 phase. After 48 h all PDA-66 treated cell lines showed a significant increase in apoptosis compared to control cells (SEM: 2.1 \u00b1 0.9 % to 10.5 \u00b1 1.3 %; RS4;11: 2.5 \u00b1 0.7 % to 7.4 \u00b1 1.1 %; Jurkat: 3.8 \u00b1 0.6 % to 8.3 \u00b1 1.9 %; MOLT-4: 3.7 \u00b1 1.2 % to 16.3 \u00b1 5.1 %). Apoptosis of ALL cells was initiated by cleavage of caspase 3 and 7 and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Furthermore, with increasing concentration of PDA-66 a decrease of pGSK3\u03b2Ser9 was observed after 4\u00a0h in SEM cells. However, no influence on the total form of \u03b2-catenin was detectable. Nevertheless, there was an influence of PDA-66 on the expression of 4EBP-1 and p4EBP-1Ser65. SEM, RS4;11 and Jurkat cells showed a decrease of the phosphorylated as well as the total form of 4EBP-1 after an incubation of 4 and 24\u00a0h. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the newly synthesized indolymalemides have pronounced antiproliferative effects in ALL cells. In particular, the indolymalemide PDA-66 should be further investigated concerning it\u2019s clinical efficiency as well as well as it's intracellular ways of action.
