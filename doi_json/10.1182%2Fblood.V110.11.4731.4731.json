    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable neoplastic disease characterized by an accumulation of plasma cells in bone marrow. Osteolytic bone lesions are the major source of morbidity in MM patients and are associated with bone pain and fractures and hypercalcemia. The bone lesions result from increased osteoclastic bone destruction in areas adjacent to the myeloma cells. New bone formation that normally happens at sites of previous bone resorption still occurs in early stages of the disease but is absent in advanced MM. Although the molecular basis for the increased osteoclastic activity has been intensely investigated, the basis for the decreased osteoblast activity is just beginning to be understood. Recently, inhibitors of WNT signaling pathway, Dickkorpf1 (DKK1) and secreted Frizzle-Related Protein-2 (sFRP2) have been identified as factors involved in osteoblast suppression in MM. In addition, IL-3 and IL-7 are increased in plasma of MM patients and suppress osteoblastogenesis in cell culture models. However, the role of those factors in the osteoblastic activity in MM patients is unclear. Studies in patients are confounded by cytotoxic therapy as well as bisphosphonates, which are standard therapy for MM patients. Therefore, preclinical in vivo models are required to delineate the mechanisms responsible for the profound osteoblast suppression in MM. We have developed a mouse model of myeloma bone disease in which genetically modified myeloma cells can be selectively ablated without the confounding effects of cytotoxic therapies and allows us to tract the growth of MM cells. The 5TGM1 cell line which is the most common version of murine MM, was stably transfected with the thymidine kinase (TK) gene from herpes simplex virus, which permits eradication of myeloma cells with ganciclovir, as well as GFP and luciferase genes to detect the presence of MM cells. One ug/ml ganciclovir treatment in culture results in 100% death of the transfected 5TGM1 cells in 4 days. Importantly, ganciclovir treatment of primary marrow cell cultures had no effect on growth and differentiation of osteoblast and hematopoietic progentitors. Co-culturing of primary marrow cells with 5TGM1 expressing TK has no bystander effect on osteoblast differentiation with ganciclovir treatment. Subcutaneously implanted 5TGM1 cells into SCID mice were eradicated by intraperitoneal injection of 20mg/kg ganciclovir/d for 2 weeks. The dose of ganciclovir did not affect osteoblast differentiation of primary marrow culture from the mice treated with ganciclovir. Then we injected the 5TGM1 cells into tibia of SCID nude mice (n=4 per group). After measuring the increase of serum IgG2b level, half of the mice were treated with ganciclovir for 2 weeks and the other with saline. Our preliminary data show that osteogenic cultures of bone marrow from the ganciclovir treated mice had significantly higher alkaline phosphatase activity than cultures derived from the saline treated group (p=0.03). In addition, the ganciclovir treated mice had tendency of higher trabecular bone volume than the saline-treated group (p=0.08). These results demonstrate that this model should be useful for studying mechanisms of osteoblast suppression in MM.",
