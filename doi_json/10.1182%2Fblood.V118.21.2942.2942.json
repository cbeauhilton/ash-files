However, its duration of response and long term outcome is unknown. We evaluated the long term outcomes of the first Mayo Clinic cohort of pts treated with Pom. Methods: Pts with relapsed/refractory myeloma with 1\u20133 prior therapies were enrolled. Pom 2 mg/d was given orally continuously on 28 day cycle with weekly dexamethasone 40 mg. All pts received DVT prophylaxis with aspirin, heparin or warfarin. Results: 60 pts with relapsed MM were enrolled from Nov 2007-Aug 2008. Median age was 65.5; 36 were male. Median time from diagnosis was 45.6 mo (9.\u2013-192.5). Nineteen (32%) were high-risk according to mSMART (msmart.org), and 78% were ISS Stage 2/3. Prior therapies included transplant (65%), bortezomib (33%), thalidomide (47%), lenalidomide (35%) [previous IMiD 60%] and radiation (38%). Toxicities at least possibly attributed to Pom included G3/4 anemia (5/0%), leukopenia (17/3%) and thrombocytopenia (3/0%). G3/4/5 non-hematological toxicities occurred in 30 (50%) and included fatigue (18/0/0%), pneumonia (8/2/2%), hyperglycemia (5/0/0%) and constipation (5/0/0%). Only one pt had grade 3 neuropathy. Treatment adjustment for occurred in 30 pts (50%) for pom (mostly for neutropenia) and 35 pts (58%) for dex. A median of 11.5 cycles were administered. With median follow up of 30.1 months (mo), overall response was seen in 39 (65%) [4 sCR, 5 CR, 16 VGPR, 14 PR]. Median time to first reponse (\u2265PR) was 1.7 mo (0.8\u201314.8). Median duration of response (in responders of \u2265PR) was 21.3 mo. Median PFS was 13 mo and the 2 year OS rate was 76%. Standard risk pts had median PFS of 18.4 mo and 2 year OS rate was 85%; high risk pts had median PFS of 9.2 mo and 2 year OS rate was 57%. ( Figure 1 ) Conclusions: Pom/dex is highly effective and well tolerated in relapsed MM, with a response rate of 65% even in pts with multiple prior therapies, including other IMiDs, bortezomib and transplant. The response is also durable, with median duration in excess of 21 months. Pom/dex provides long term benefit with median PFS 13 months and 2 year OS rate of 76%. Figure 1.
