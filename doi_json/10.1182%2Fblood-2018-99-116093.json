    "abstract_text": "Background. Acute Myeloid Leukemia is a heterogeneous disease, characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of hematopoietic precursor cells. AML accounts for 15% of acute leukemias in children, with a cure rate of 55-60% as overall survival (Pession A Blood 2013). Complete remission (CR) is achieved in 80-85% of children with AML. Current protocol defines CR by morphological evaluation (blasts <5%) and cytofluorimetric analyses (blasts <0,1%), after two cycles of high-dose chemotherapy. Around 10-15% of children and 30% of adults do not achieve remission and are defined as Primary Induction Failure (PIF). The majority of these cases are addressed to other form of high-dose chemotherapy blocks, experimental therapies or directly to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as salvage treatment, showing a very poor prognosis (Quarello P et al. British Journal of Haematology 2015). Strong efforts to generate biological data in order to define this subtype of AML are needed for early identification and for target therapy design. Aim . Our study aims to characterize a specific gene-expression profile in children with PIF-AML in order to early detect peculiar genetic aberrations and to identify potential targets to new compounds. Materials and Methods . We analyzed diagnostic samples from 4 children with PIF-AML, diagnosed and treated in our Center, from 2013 to 2016. All cases were female and 3 had more than 10 years of age. One presented with a monosomy of chromosome 11; two with complex karyotype (one with NUP98-NSD1 rearrangement) and one with no cytogenetic and molecular markers. After two cycles of Induction phase, one case showed complete blast regeneration (>60%); in the other three cases we detected, by flow-cytometry, a blast rate between 10-20%. In the attempt to compare these cases with those presenting with very high-risk (VHR) features but achieving CR after induction (Primary Induction Responder, PIR), we included in our analyses 8 children with VHR-PIR-AML, diagnosed and treated in our Center: 2 with FLT3-ITD and NUP98-NSD1 fusion genes; 2 with FLT3-ITD and complex karyotype; 2 with DEK-CAN fusion genes (1 with FLT3-ITD ); 2 with NUP98 rearrangements and complex karyotype. We performed whole transcriptome analyses using Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 (Affymetrix). Then we compared our analyses with a recently published data set, including a large population of children with AML (Bisio V Leukemia 2017). Based on transcriptomic findings, we determined the expression of specific genes, by Real-time PCR using gene-specific probes (UPL probes by Roche Merck, Germany), applying a QuantStudio7 Flex System technology (Applied Biosystem, California, USA) and the relative quantification method (the comparative 2 -\u0394\u0394Ct method). We applied a t-student test, for statistical analyses among different subgroups. Results . A direct comparison of PIF-AML vs PIR-AML subgroups revealed 919 protein-coding and 8 pri-miRNA overexpressed genes (fold-change >3, FDR adjusted p value -3, FDR adjusted p value <0.05). Marked differences were observed in cancer-related genes such as KIT , PTEN , FLT3 and POU4F1 , and in cell-cycle related genes such as cyclin transcripts ( CNNG1, CCNA1, CCND2, CCNJ, CCNC, CCNY ). Moreover some genes that discriminate PIF from PIR subgroups are also differentially expressed between cases with NUP98-negative and NUP98-positive AML ( PDGFD, CCNA1 ). The latter group is considered as a VHR-AML subtype. Based on these findings, we selected several genes including HOX-B3 , HOX-B5 , CEBP-D , CCNA1 , PDGF-D and performed a Real-Time PCR with specific-gene probes. Comparing gene expression data of our 4 PIF-AML cases with 8 VHR-PIR-AML cases, we observed a strong statistically significant different expression in CCNA1 (p<0.0001) and PDGF-D (p<0.0001). Conclusions . Our findings defined a characteristic profile of PIF-AML, highlighting the overexpression of cell-cycle related genes ( CCNG1, CCNA1 ) and several potential targets (KIT, FLT3, PDGF-D) to be considered for an alternative treatment in this very poor-prognostic subgroup of patients. In conclusion our results suggest that PIF-AML samples bear a specific gene expression profile, not overlapping with those of known molecular and karyotype AML subgroups. However, a larger population study is needed to confirm our preliminary data. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
