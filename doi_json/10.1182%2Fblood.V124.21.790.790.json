    "abstract_text": "Background & Significance: Pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) emerges in virtually all cases from B cell precursors that are arrested at the pre-B cell receptor checkpoint. In a gene expression survey of early B cell development, we found specific upregulation of FOXM1 at this developmental stage. FOXM1 belongs to the forkhead box transcription factor family and is a key regulator of cell growth by promoting cell cycle progression and has been implicated in progression of solid tumors. Therefore, we characterized the function and regulation of FOXM1 in normal B cell development as well as in pre-B ALL. Results: First, we verified the upregulation of FOXM1 during B cell development by qRT-PCR on sorted human and murine B cell progenitor populations. Then, we crossed Mb1-Cre tg mice to a Foxm1 conditional knockout mouse model ( Foxm1 fl/fl ) and analyzed the early B cell populations according to the Hardy fractions. Despite the observed high expression of Foxm1 mRNA in fraction C\u2019 and D, Foxm1 deletion did not alter B cell development. In order to investigate a potential role of FOXM1 in transformed B cells, we compared FOXM1 protein levels in patient-derived pre-B ALL samples with healthy B cells and B cell precursors and found 10-60-fold higher expression in the transformed B cell progenitors. To evaluate a potential predictive value of FOXM1 levels in patient-derived ALL samples, we measured FOXM1 mRNA levels at the time of diagnosis which strikingly correlate with risk stratification of ALL (intermediate-risk ALL n=31 vs. high risk ALL n=21; P =7.3e-5; BFM-REZ 2002). To further study the function and regulation of FOXM1, we cultured murine B cell precursors in the presence of IL7 and induced transformation with a retroviral BCR-ABL1 expression vector. BCR-ABL1 expression increased levels of FOXM1 compared to the normal IL7-dependent pre-B cells. Short-term inhibition of BCR-ABL1 did not affected protein levels of FOXM1. However, after 4 days of tyrosine kinase inhibition (TKI) treatment, FOXM1 protein levels were significantly downregulated in a dose-dependent manner. BCL2 overexpression prevented apoptosis induction by TKI but FOXM1 downregulation was retained. In addition, we found evidence that inactivation of FOXO factors by the PI3K/AKT pathway contributes to high FOXM1 expression in Ph + ALL. Overexpression of a constitutively active form of Akt to prevent activation of FOXO factors in the presence of TKI abrogated FOXM1 downregulation. Similarly, BCR-ABL1 + ALL derived from FOXO3a knockout mice prevented TKI-mediated FOXM1 reduction. Overexpression of a constitutively active form of FOXO3a but not FOXO1 significantly reduces levels of FOXM1 expression. In line with this, we found a significant inverse correlation of FOXM1 with FOXO3A mRNA levels in Ph + ALL patients from the ECOG E2993 trial. However, the requirement of long-term treatment indicates, that, in addition to FOXO3a activation, epigenetic regulation of the FOXM1 promoter downstream of BCR-ABL1 is required. Consistent with this finding, the FOXM1 promoter region was found to be de-methylated in a large fraction of ALL. In order to further study FOXM1 function, we transduced pre-B cells derived from Foxm1 fl/fl mice with BCR-ABL1 and with an inducible ERT2-Cre vector. Deletion of Foxm1 in BCR-ABL1-driven leukemia decreases cell viability, colony formation, and proliferative capacity in vitro as well as leukemia formation in vivo . FOXM1-deleted ALL cells revealed a strikingly higher sensitivity towards TKI-treatment compared to the control cells in Imatinib dose-response curves (IC 50 EV: 420 nM vs IC 50 Cre-ER T2 : 160 nM) as well as annexin V staining. We identified the ROS scavenger Catalase as a critical target of FOXM1 in mediating this drug resistance. As potential therapeutic agents to target FOXM1, we evaluated the effects of a previously described ARF peptide and the natural occurring antibiotic Thiostrepton. Both bind FOXM1 and inhibit its function as shown by reduced mRNA expression of FOXM1 target genes ( Cyclin B1, PLK1, AURKB ) and induced apoptosis in ALL and prolonged survival of patient-derived ALL transplant recipient mice. Conclusion: We have identified a critical function of the transcription factor FOXM1 in mediating proliferation and drug-resistance in B cell lineage ALL, but not in normal B cell progenitors and validated FOXM1 as a therapeutic target in a large fraction of drug-resistant B cell lineage ALL.
