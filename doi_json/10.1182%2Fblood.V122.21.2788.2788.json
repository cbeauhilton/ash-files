    "abstract_text": "Background In 2001, the World Health Organization modified the French-American-British (FAB) classification for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by folding the refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-t) category into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Whether this group of patients (pts) should be treated with AML versus MDS therapy remains controversial. A subset analysis of the AZA-001 trial showed that azacitidine prolongs overall survival (OS) in elderly pts with low blasts AML (bone marrow blasts [BM] 20-30%). Aim To compare the clinical outcome and OS of patients with MDS or AML with BM blasts between 10-30%, treated with hypomethylating agents (HMA) vs intensive chemotherapy (IC). Patients and Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of newly diagnosed pts with MDS (or AML by WHO) and BM blasts between 10-30% treated with either HMA (alone or in combination with investigational therapies) or IC on clinical trials. Eligibility was based on pt characteristics and specific protocol inclusion criteria. A univariate Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the overall effects of treatments and outcome (remission duration (RD), and OS). Then a regression model with the interactions between treatments and baseline covariates were used for subgroup analysis. The final model was obtained by a stepwise selection using 0.05 as a cut off of significant values. Results 330 patients were included in the final analysis, with 93 (28%) HMA-treated pts and 237 (72%) pts treated with IC. Clinical characteristics at diagnosis are summarized in Table1 . The overall response rate (ORR= CR+CR p) was 42% for the pts who treated with HMA and 60% for pts treated with IC ( P = 0.01). The median RD was similar between the two groups (14.7 mos (m) vs. 14.7 mos, respectively, P = 0.74). Early induction mortality was also similar among the two groups (4-week mortality was 5% vs. 7%, respectively, and the 8-week mortality was 10% vs. 13 %, respectively). With median follow up of 37 mos (range, 1-94 mos), the median OS was 18.8 mos for pts who treated with HMA vs. 14.6 mos for pts treated with IC ( P = 0.32). Moreover, the BM blasts percentage did not impact the overall outcome. In multivariate analysis, treatment with IC was associated with worse OS compared to HMA (HR 2.09, 95% CI 2.07-3.17, P = 0.003) but not for RD (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.89-2.68, P = 0.13).

Interestingly, BM blast percentages within this cohort did not impact overall outcome suggesting that pts with BM blasts 20-30% may achieve better outcome with MDS therapy.
