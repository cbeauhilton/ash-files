    "abstract_text": "Introduction Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive disease with genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity that results in a highly variable response to standard chemotherapy. Azacitidine (AZA) is a hypomethylating agent (HMA) and has been investigated in combination with intensive chemotherapy as an epigenetic primer to sensitize leukemic cells to treatment. In a phase 1 trial, this regimen was safe and well-tolerated with overall response rate (CR+CRi) of 61% and complete remission rate of 41% (Cahill et al, Blood Adv 2020). Predictive biomarkers for response to this treatment strategy have not yet been identified. Since 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is an epigenetic biomarker in cancer, we hypothesized that Nano-5hmC-Seal sequencing technology may serve as a novel approach to identifying 5hmC profiles predictive of treatment response to epigenetic priming. Methods We performed RNA-seq gene expression and Nano-5hmC-Seal DNA profiling from peripheral blood/bone marrow samples of patients with high-risk AML to identify potential 5hmC profile biomarkers and gene expression changes ( Figure 1A ). Patients (n=46) were treated in a 3+3 dose-escalation scheme of AZA (37.5 mg/m 2 , 50 mg/m 2 , or 75 mg/m 2 ) on days 1-5 followed by high-dose cytarabine (3000 mg/m 2 ) and mitoxantrone (30 mg/m 2 ) (AZA-HiDAC-Mito) on day 6 and day 10 in a phase 1 trial previously reported (Cahill et al, Blood Adv 2020). We compared pre-treatment RNA-seq gene expression and 5hmC DNA profiles between responders (CR+CRi) and non-responders, as well as between pre-treatment and after 5 days of AZA for individual patients. We used an XGBoost machine learning model in Python based on a training set of patients to develop a 5hmC gene signature to predict response to AZA-HiDAC-Mito in an independent test set of patients. We compared continuous variables with two-tailed Student's t-test and used the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test for survival analysis. Results Thirty-three patients (72%) had adequate RNA samples for RNA-seq gene expression analysis. Eighteen responded to treatment (CR +CRi) and were enriched with gene expression patterns involved in cell-cell interaction and activation of cell cycle, while non-responders (n=15) had a higher expression of leukemic stem cell (LSC) signatures. There was no difference in gene expression profile when comparing pre-treatment samples to day 5 samples after AZA exposure. From the 5hmC profiling [n=40 (87%) patients with adequate samples], increased 5hmC in LSC genes was associated with treatment resistance to AZA-HiDAC-Mito (p=0.044). The number of differentially hydroxy-methylated genes (DhMGs) increased with higher doses of AZA exposure suggesting a dose-dependent epigenetic effect from AZA. Patients with a greater number of DhMGs following 5 days of AZA treatment had improved survival (p=0.015) ( Figure 1B ). Using the 5hmC-based XGBoost machine learning model comparing 5hmC profiles between responders to non-responders from a training set of patients (n=22), we developed an 11-gene 5hmC pre-treatment signature (including SKP1, WNT8A, CYP2E1 , and NBPF9 ) to predict treatment response. The model was highly effective in predicting response to therapy, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 in an independent test set of patients (n=18) treated with AZA-HiDAC-Mito ( Figure 1C ). Conclusion In patients with AML treated with AZA-HiDAC-Mito, a pre-treatment LSC gene expression signature enriched with 5hmC was associated with treatment resistance. More DhMGs at day 5 appear to be a dose-dependent epigenetic effect that is induced by AZA and is associated with longer survival despite the absence of an immediate change in gene expression levels. An 11-gene 5hmC pre-treatment signature may be a predictive biomarker for AZA-HiDAC-Mito therapy and other HMA-based approaches. These findings warrant validation in a larger prospective trial.
