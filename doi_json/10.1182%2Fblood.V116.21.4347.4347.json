    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4347 Background: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a disease that is responsive to T-cell-mediated immunity. K562/granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a vaccine derived from a CML cell line that produces GM-CSF and expresses several CML-associated antigens. An initial pilot study was performed in 19 patients in chronic phase CML who had achieved at least a major cytogenetic response on imatinib mesylate (IM) but had measurable molecular disease. The results suggested that immunotherapy resulted in a lowering tumor burden in the majority of patients (n = 13) with a total of 7 patients achieving undetectable bcr-abl levels by QT-PCR. (Smith, Clinical Cancer Research, 2010). This extension study evaluated the biologic impact of K562/GM-CSF given as a \u201cbooster\u201d in subjects who completed the pilot study's scheduled 4 vaccinations and continued to have have persistent measurable disease or who lost their best response to the original therapy. Methods: This is a single-institution pilot study using open-label K562/GM-CSF vaccination as a \u201cbooster\u201d in chronic phase CML patients who were previously treated with a full 4-vaccination course of therapy and continued to have measurable CML disease. Patients were stratified as having either responded to the initial set of vaccines and had subsequent loss of response or as having had no measurable response to therapy. None experienced significant adverse events in the first set of vaccinations. \u201cBooster\u201d treatment consisted of 4 doses of 1 \u00d7 10 8 irradiated K562/GM-CSF given every 3 weeks. Imatinib was continued through the study at the patients\u2019 starting doses. Disease burden was measured using peripheral blood RT-PCR and FISH was every 3 months throughout the course of planned booster vaccinations for up to a year following the vaccination boost. Patients with evidence of advancing disease requiring adjustments to their IM dosing or those progressing to accelerated or blast phase were taken off study. Results: 11 patients met the eligibility to receive the booster vaccinations. Mean age was 54 (range 38\u201378) years. Median dose of IM therapy was 600 mg daily (range 400\u2013800 mg). The median time from final vaccination in the pilot study to first booster vaccination was 24 (range 18\u201324) months. Duration of follow up was a median of 36 months (range 6\u201342 months). In general, the trend for lower disease burden following booster vaccines was significant by Generalize Estimating Equation using all study measures (p pre-vaccination samples. Of these, 15 antigens were recognized in 2 or more subjects. The influence of the vaccine boost series on antibody titer and on the induction of antibodies to antigens not previously recognized is under study. K562/GM-CSF immunotherapy given as a \u201cbooster\u201d vaccination was associated with the lowering tumor burdens in 7 of 11 treated patients. Ongoing efforts to identify tumor-associated antigens that may be serving as immunologic targets is ongoing. Disclosures: Levitsky: HL vaccine: Patents & Royalties."
