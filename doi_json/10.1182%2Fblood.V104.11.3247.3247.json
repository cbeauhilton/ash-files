    "abstract_text": "Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM; CD106), a member of the Ig Superfamily of molecules, binds to the \u03b2-1 integrin, Very Late Antigen-4 (VLA-4; CD49d); this interaction plays an integral role in leukocyte trafficking as well as lymphocyte-stromal cell interactions. VCAM can be shed from the surface of cells, and, in humans, serum levels of soluble VCAM (sVCAM) parallel activity and remission states in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and inflammation. Although widely investigated as a stromal-cell associated molecule, our lab and others have recently identified VCAM expression on normal bone-marrow derived B-lymphoid cells. Using FACS technology, we found that surface expression of VCAM is closely modulated at specific stages of B cell development, with relatively high levels on the pro-B cell population, down-modulation in pre-B cells at the onset of immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement, and subsequent re-expression at variable levels in immature and mature peripheral B cell subsets. We have verified VCAM transcripts by cDNA PCR in highly purified populations of murine precursor B cells. Normal human bone marrow precursor B-lymphoid populations (hematogones) also demonstrate VCAM surface protein expression. Finally, in an animal model of BCR/ABL+ ALL, we found that VCAM expression is dramatically increased on lymphoblasts when compared to normal reference populations in bone marrow and spleen. VCAM expression in human lymphoid malignancies is currently under investigation. Antibody-mediated VCAM cross-linking on primary B-cell precursors ex-vivo generates intracellular reactive oxygen species, demonstrating that signaling through this molecule has functional consequences. Intriguingly, in-vivo, VCAM expression is limited to B-lymphoid cells harvested from tissues such as bone marrow, spleen and lymph node; since, in the same animal, peripheral blood lymphocytes and peritoneal cells do not express readily detectable levels of the surface antigen. VCAM-expressing B-lymphoid cells cultured ex-vivo gradually lose surface expression over 24 hours. The tissue-associated modulation of VCAM expression is preserved in the murine Ph+ lymphoblasts; leukemia cells isolated from the peripheral blood express very low levels of surface VCAM compared to those harvested from bone marrow or spleen. Our data suggests that VCAM expression is dependent on tissue-specific microenvironmental signals in-vivo. B-lymphoid expression of both VCAM and its ligand VLA-4 is a surprising finding that has broad implications regarding leukemic cell interaction with endothelial cells, the bone marrow retention and trafficking of precursor- and leukemic-B cell populations, and the interpretation of an extensive experimental database predicated on the stromal-cell specificity of VCAM expression and function.",
