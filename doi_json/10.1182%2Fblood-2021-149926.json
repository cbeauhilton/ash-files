    "abstract_text": "[Background] ETV6-FRK is a rare kinase-related fusion gene which was identified only in acute myeloid leukemia (Hosoya N, et al. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2005). Herein, we firstly identified ETV6-FRK fusion gene in a patient with high-risk pediatric B cell precursor ALL (B-ALL). Because FRK is Src family tyrosine kinase, we performed functional analysis of ETV6-FRK to establish molecular targeting therapy. [Patient] A 11-year-old boy with B-ALL was refractory to conventional chemotherapy and received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) following two courses of blinatumomab. This patient maintains complete remission for three months after allo-BMT. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated t(6;12)(q21;p13) as a part of complex karyotype. Targeted capture mRNA sequencing identified ETV6-FRK fusion transcript in this patient. [Materials and methods] ETV6-FRK fusion was validated by RT-PCR of the diagnostic leukemic sample from this patient. Full length of ETV6-FRK cDNA was cloned into retroviral vector with Tet-On system. Then, Ba/F3 cells, which are IL-3 dependent murine pro B-ALL cells, were transduced with retroviral vector to establish Ba/F3 cells expressing ETV6-FRK (Ba/F3-ETV6-FRK) under doxycycline (DOX) dependent manner. Ba/F3-ETV6-FRK was analyzed whether IL-3 independent growth was achieved. To determine whether aberrant activation of FRK-STAT pathway as the downstream effects of ETV6-FRK, activation of FRK-STAT pathway was evaluated by western blot. Finally, in cytotoxic assay, proliferation of Ba/F3-ETV6-FRK was assessed under the media with various concentrations of dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. [Results and discussions] Sequencing of RT-PCR product revealed that ETV6 exon 4 was fused in-frame to FRK exon 3, creating an ETV6-FRK fusion gene. The ETV6-FRK fusion gene produced a chimeric protein consisting of the entire pointed (PNT) oligomerization domain of ETV6 and the kinase domain of FRK (Fig 1). The expression of ETV6-FRK in Ba/F3 cells under DOX dependent manner was confirmed by western blot. Ba/F3-ETV6-FRK proliferated without IL-3 in contrast to Ba/F3 cells not expressing ETV6-FRK (p<0.01), suggesting ETV6-FRK had proliferation activity. Western blot analysis revealed constitutive phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of ETV6-FRK and STAT5/STAT3/STAT1, suggesting constitutive activation of FRK-STATs pathway was associated with IL-3 independent proliferation activity of ETV6-FRK. Considering that dasatinib, which is Src-kinase inhibitor, could block constitutive phosphorylation of ETV6-FRK, we hypothesized that dasatinib might block the IL-3 independent proliferation of Ba/F3-ETV6-FRK. In vitro killing assay showed that dasatinib suppressed efficiently the proliferation of Ba/F3-ETV6-FRK with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) 1.64 \u00b1 0.02 nM, although dasatinib didn't show any effect on Ba/F3 cells not expressing ETV6-FRK (Fig. 2). Annexin V assay determined that 35.8 \u00b1 6.9 % of Ba/F3-ETV6-FRK with dasatinib (10nM, 48hrs) were apoptotic than Ba/F3 cells not expressing ETV6-FRK (Fig. 3, p<0.01). These findings suggested that dasatinib abolished the proliferation activity of ETV6-FRK selectively. [Conclusion] We identified the first patient of pediatric high-risk B-ALL harboring ETV6-FRK fusion by targeted capture mRNA sequencing, who was refractory to the conventional chemotherapy. We also provide the first evidence that dasatinib could abrogate proliferation activity of ETV6-FRK  in vitro , suggesting that dasatinib might be effective for the patient with B-ALL carrying a ETV6-FRK fusion.
