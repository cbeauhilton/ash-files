    "abstract_text": "G-CSF is used for mobilization of hematopoietic cells in healthy adolescent donors and pediatric patients. In both groups it is important to ascertain factors predicting the success of apheresis as well as the number of procedures to achieve the target CD34+ cell number for hematologic recovery. We retrospectively analyzed factors predicting the yield for a target CD34+ cell dose in10 healthy adolescent donors and 43 children with solid tumours who were enrolled in the transplantation program at our center from January 1996 to July 2007. The healthy adolescents (n=10) had a median age of 15 years (range 13\u201316) and body weight (bw) of 45 kg (range 20\u201374) and the children with solid tumours (n=42) (Neuroblastoma n=28, Ewing sarcoma n=7 and other solid tumours n=7) had a median age of 4 years (range 1\u201315) and bw of 17 kg (range 9 \u2013 63). Mobilization regimen consisted of G-CSF in a dosage of 10 \u03bcg/kg per day, applied subcutaneously for 5 or 6 days. A pre-collection peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ count was performed in all children, by flow cytometric analysis. Standard volume apheresis was carried out using a Cobe Spectra blood cell separator, through peripheral veins in donors and central lines in patients. We estimated a minimum of 4 x10 6 and 2x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg bw receptor for successful engraftment for allogeneic and autologous transplant, respectively. The healthy adolescent donors had high number of PB CD34+ cells (median 62/\u03bcl, range 42 \u2013 75) and the majority (7/10) only required a single apheresis to collect sufficient cells for their family related recipients. The neuroblastoma patients with >10/\u03bcl PB CD34+ cells collected in one day the target cell dose (median 4.6x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg, range 2.6 \u2013 27.0). Those with 2.0 x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg in 2 apheresis. In summary all the children with solid tumours received a single course of G-CSF and presented on the 5 th day of mobilization a median PB CD34+ cell count of 9/\u03bcl (range 1\u2013216). The majority (75%) collected >2.0 x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg and the remaining (25%) had 10/\u03bcl was a good indicator for performing PBPC collections in paediatric patients from our institution.",
