    "abstract_text": "High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is a standard treatment for patients (pts) with relapsed or primary refractory lymphoma that is responding to salvage chemotherapy. Limitations of ASCT include significant morbidity, cost, restriction of further treatment options, and frequent relapse of lymphoma. To define the ability of FDG-PET to predict clinical outcome after ASCT, we conducted a retrospective analysis of lymphoma pts in our institution who received salvage chemotherapy followed by ASCT for relapsed or primary refractory lymphoma between 1999 and 2005. We identified 47 lymphoma pts (19 with diffuse large B-cell, 18 with Hodgkin, 4 with mantle cell, 3 with follicular and 3 with other lymphomas) who had an FDG-PET scan after at least two cycles of salvage chemotherapy and prior to ASCT. Three pts were excluded from the analysis because their FDG-PET scan results were non-conclusive. The remaining 44 pts (median age 44 yrs, range: 19\u201365) were categorized into FDG-PET scan negative (26 pts) and positive (18 pts) groups. Each group was evaluated for event-free survival (EFS), which was defined as the interval between the date of the transplant to the date of relapse after complete remission (CR) or the date of progression for pts without CR or the date of death from any cause without a documented relapse. The overall median follow-up was 14 mo (range: 2\u201358). There were no statistically significant differences in the distribution of lymphoma subtypes between the two groups. In the FDG-PET negative group, the median EFS was 18 mo (range: 3\u201358) with 14 pts (54%) remaining in CR. In the FDG-PET positive group, the median EFS was 5 mo (range: 1.5\u201319) with only 1 pt (6%) remaining in CR. Comparison between the two groups confirmed that the difference in the median EFS was highly statistically significant (p<0.001). Additional data to determine the correlation of the FDG-PET with conventional CT scans will be presented. Our study suggests that a positive FDG-PET scan after salvage chemotherapy and prior to ASCT indicates an extremely poor chance of achieving a prolonged remission after ASCT. Clinical trials of new approaches should be investigated for pts with relapsed or primary refractory lymphoma that remains detectable by FDG-PET after salvage chemotherapy.
