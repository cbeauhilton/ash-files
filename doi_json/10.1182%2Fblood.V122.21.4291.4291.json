    "abstract_text": "B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling has been identified as a critical driver of B-cell malignancies and as a target for therapeutic attack. Clinical responses to novel inhibitors of BCR-associated kinases have been relatively modest in follicular lymphoma (FL) and a more detailed knowledge of BCR function in these cells is required. Surface Ig (sIg) is unusual in FL since variable regions contain N -linked glycosylation sites which are introduced by somatic mutation. These are rarely found in normal B cells, indicating strong positive selective pressure in malignant cells. Remarkably, added sugars terminate with high mannose suggesting a novel function for FL BCRs in binding to, and perhaps receiving stimulation via, microenvironmental mannose-binding lectins. In previous studies we demonstrated that candidate mannose-binding lectins, including DC-SIGN, promote intracellular calcium mobilization in primary FL cells, but not normal B cells. In this work, we characterized in more detail the response of FL cells to DC-SIGN and its inhibition by BCR-targeted kinase inhibitors. Initial studies using immunoblotting demonstrated that, like anti-Ig antibodies, DC-SIGN caused increased phosphorylation of the downstream kinases AKT and ERK in primary FL samples. DC-SIGN treatment also resulted in increased expression of the MYC oncoprotein in a subset of samples. In contrast to FL samples, DC-SIGN did not increase AKT or ERK phosphorylation in normal B cells although anti-IgM induced strong responses in these cells. Overall, responses to DC-SIGN were similar in IgM + and IgG + FL samples. Flow cytometry demonstrated that DC-SIGN also increased phosphorylation of proximal signaling kinases (SYK and BTK), as well as phosphorylation of PLC\u03b32 in FL samples, and that DC-SIGN-induced signaling occurred within the CD19 + BCL2 + malignant cells. Flow cytometry also revealed intraclonal variation in responses to DC-SIGN and, like responses to anti-Ig, DC-SIGN responses were strongest in a sub-population of malignant cells with high CD20 expression. Finally, we demonstrated that tamatinib, the active form of the SYK inhibitor pro-drug fostamatinib, significantly inhibited phosphorylation of ERK and PLC\u03b32 induced by either anti-Ig or DC-SIGN. Overall our results are consistent with the hypothesis that N -linked glycosylation sites, introduced into BCRs by somatic mutation, are selected for in FL since they confer signaling responsiveness following binding of environmental lectins. Like canonical antigen signaling, lectin-mediated signaling via the BCR appears to be susceptible to therapeutic blockade using kinase inhibitors. However, further analysis of this novel lectin-mediated pathway may reveal novel targets for optimal therapeutic attack. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
