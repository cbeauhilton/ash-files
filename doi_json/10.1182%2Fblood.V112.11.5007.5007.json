    "abstract_text": "Lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin disease (LPHD) presents as early-stage disease with slow disease progression and excellent initial response to conventional chemotherapy. Although 96% of LPHD patients experience a complete remission (CR) upon first line treatment, many relapses occur. Residual tumor cells in Hodgkin\u2019s patients can survive standard therapy and cause relapse. Thus, the elimination of minimal residual disease after first line treatment might improve the outcome in Hodgkin disease. CD20+ is strongly expressed by malignant cells in LPHD, but so far there is limited information regarding the efficacy of Rituximab in this patient population. A 66 year-old woman presented with bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy in 2004 and complained on malaise and weight loss. Lymph node biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of LPHD and immunohistochemistry confirmed that CD20 antigen was expressed on more than 30% of malignant cells. Staging revealed II B disease. There were lymph node enlargements in the pelvis on CT. Her blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and albumin were normal with elevation of and lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phoshatase. She was treated with ABVD regiment 8 cycles and CR was achieved. After standard chemotherapy patient with CD20+ LPHD received four weekly doses of Rituximab at 375 mg/m 2 and maintenance therapy with additional four doses of Rituximab every three months for the next year. Treatment was well tolerated without any complications. Evaluation of disease assessment included physical examination and computed tomography, bone marrow biopsy and routine analyses, after the end of treatment and every 3 months after for the first two years, and on six months for the following year. There were no abnormalities on CT after the end of the treatment. Patient was in complete remission. CT after 36 months showed no detectible tumor mass. Patient remains still in complete remission three years after chemotherapy without detectible tumor mass. Our case report suggests that Rituximab is both safe and effective in patients with CD20+ LPHD. The optimal treatment for patients with LPHD remains uncertain. Current research aims to identify alternative treatment approaches that possess significant activity but less toxicity. Radiotherapy for early-stage patients and chemotherapy or combined modality treatment for advanced-stage patients remains to be standard of care. Initial observed benefit of Rituximab treatment in this group of patients suggests that there is a role for monoclonal antibodies in optimal treatment approach, especially in improving the outcome. Further studies with Rituximab are warranted in this patient population.",
