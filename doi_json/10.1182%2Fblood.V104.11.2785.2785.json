    "abstract_text": "Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) comprise a sub-family of TGF-beta-like molecules that exert a wide range of biological activities during development, and are essential for normal hematopoiesis. However, the precise stage in development that BMP signaling regulates hematopoiesis is not defined. Three proteins, Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 transmit BMP signals to the nucleus to activate the expression of hematopoietic-specific transcription factors. These Smads are homologous in their sequences, and appear to be regulated similarly, however their specificity in regulating hematopoiesis remains undefined. Although Smad proteins are regulated post-translationally, their expression is also under transcriptional control during development. We examined the specificity of Smad1/5/8 activity in the context of primitive erythropoiesis, using the mouse embryonic stem cell /embryoid body (ES/EB) system. We exploited ES cells with GFP targeted to the brachyury locus, in order to identify specific sub-sets of progenitors. Smad1 transcript levels are initially upregulated as ES cells become fated to mesoderm and hematopoietic progenitors, but the levels are significantly decreased in cells derived from differentiating primitive erythroid colonies. In contrast, Smad5 transcript levels show the opposite profile, being more correlated with erythroid differentiation. To directly assess the role of these Smads during erythropoiesis, their activity is being manipulated in ES cells during the commitment phases of embryonic hematopoiesis. For this purpose, inducible ES cell lines were generated capable of forcing the expression of wildtype Smad1 or Smad5, or a dominant-negative isoform of Smad5, at any stage of ES/EB development. Colony assays were used to analyze quantitatively the hematopoietic potential of these cells. Forced expression of Smad1 results in a marked increase in primitive red blood cell colony formation as compared to control ES cells. Maintenance of Smad1 expression does not appear to inhibit terminal differentiation. Based on a time-study of the induction, the effect on erythoid colonies could be due to expansion of earlier progenitors. Current experiments using the in vitro blast assay are examining the direct effect of Smad1 expression on earlier (hemangioblast) development. This data, and analogous analyses of cells induced to express Smad5 or the dominant-negative Smad isoform are in progress and will be presented. These studies should facilitate our understanding of the specificity of BMP-regulated Smads during commitment and differentiation of embryonic stem cells and hematopoietic progenitors."
