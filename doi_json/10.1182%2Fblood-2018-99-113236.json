    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) has emerged as a potential prognostic factor in solid tumors and lymphomas. Previous studies have shown an association between increased levels of RDW and inflammatory diseases, being a surrogate marker of inflammation and a predictor of poor outcome. Data on the impact of RDW in outcomes of patients with aggressive peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) are scarce. Methods: We performed a retrospective study on consecutive patients with a de novo diagnosis of aggressive PTCL diagnosed and treated at our institution between 2010 to 2016. All patients included were treated with chemotherapy with a curative intent. The RDW was collected from the hemogram of PTCL patients at diagnosis. RDW-CV >14% and RDW-SD >49 fL were our cut-offs for the categorical analysis. We fitted univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models for overall survival (OS). P<0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 101 patients with de novo aggressive PTCL were included. This study included 53 patients (52%) with PTCL, not otherwise specified, 16 patients (16%) with extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma,15 (15%) with adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia,14 patients (14%) with anaplastic large cell lymphoma, 2 patients (2%) with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, and 1 patient (1%) with enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. Median age was 57 with a male predominance (69%). Clinically, 45 patients (45%) were 60 years or older, 41 patients (34%) had ECOG \u22652, 63 patients (65%) had increased LDH levels, 68 patients (67%) had > 1 extranodal site, 65 patients (64%) had stage III/IV disease, and 55 patients (54%) had B symptoms. RDW-CV was >14% in 64 patients (64%). RDW-SD was >49 fL in 35 patients (35%). 38% of patients received CHOEP, 29% received CHOP, and 33% received other regimens. The overall response rate was 68%; 50% had a complete response and 18% had a partial response. At 5 years, median overall survival (OS) was 46%. In the univariate Cox regression analysis, ECOG \u22652 (p14% (p49 fL (p=0.007) and high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR >4) (p=0.002) were associated with a worse survival. In the multivariate Cox regression analyses, ECOG \u22652 (HR 3.1 CI 1.6-6.0; p=0.001) and high RDW-CV >14% (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.0; p=0.01) were independent predictors of poor survival. RDW-CV was an independent factor of survival when was compared with IPI and NCCN-IPI score. Conclusions: RDW is an independent marker for adverse prognosis in aggressive patients with aggressive PTCL treated with curative intent. Figure. View large Download slide Figure.
