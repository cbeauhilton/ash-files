    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2810 Poster Board II-786 We wished to explore the genetic events associated with disease progression and development of drug resistance in multiple myeloma (MM). To do so 11 patients were studied in whom at least two (range 2-3) temporally distinct samples of tumor DNA and RNA were available. The baseline genetic initiating event was defined for all patients (3 were genetic high risk; one with t(14;16) two with t(4;14)) as well as the gene expression profile (GEP) defined risk score using the Little Rock 70 or 17 gene panel (only one, the t(14;16) was GEP defined high risk). High resolution array CGH and gene expression were then performed on each sample. Of the 8 patients with a \u201clow risk\u201d tumor initiating event and low risk GEP score, 6 patients had no, or only one, copy number abnormality (CNA) change between the two temporally distinct MM samples. In stark contrast the 3 genetic high risk at baseline had between 17 and 40 distinct CNA changes at the time of progression. For all 11 patients 89 CNA were acquired with progression whereas 19 previously abnormal regions disappeared suggesting clones with these abnormalities were extinguished by the therapy received. In total we detected 0-40 CNA changes between the various timepoints, median 1, mean 10.7. The acquisition of new CNA was much more common than the loss of CNA. We then focused more specifically on the t(4;14) patient with the highest number of CNA changes. This patient has a well documented clinical course of having a sustained two year VGPR to Len/dex and then progressing while still taking Len/dex. Comparison of the pre and post-Len/dex samples identified 40 CNA changes(the most of any pair studied to date). Only six CNA were shared between the two samples, which included deletions of chr4, 9, 12, 13, and X plus a t(4;14) translocation. These likely represent the initiating \u201cdriver\u201d tumor events. The new CNA we identified originated from both remodeled genomic changes and the emergence of unique changes, indicating a new tumor clone had emerged while the previously dominant clone had regressed (e.g. a deletion of a large segment of chromosome 8 at diagnosis was no longer observed in the relapse sample). The newly acquired CNA encompassed 3968 genes (13.7% of the genes in the genome), however, only 1235 of these genes (4%) were expressed in this patient at diagnosis (1188 in the typical myeloma patient). Since 1235 genes is still a large number we hypothesized that whole genome sequencing (WGS) would help elucidate the mechanism of lenalidomide resistance. We isolated DNA from germline tissue and CD138 purified tumor cells including: diagnostic, first relapse and second relapse samples. Utilizing SOLiD (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) sequencing technology, we have completed fragment library WGS on both the germline and the final tumor samples. Quality control measures report the average number of sequence reads per start point to be less than 1.2, indicating the library is primarily composed of unique molecules. In addition, approximately 40% of the sequence reads map uniquely to the genome. Together these quality measures indicate our sample libraries are complex and provide good representation of the genome. Data on the whole genome sequence of myeloma at diagnosis and at the time of progression will be presented. Disclosures: Bergsagel: Celgene: Consultancy.",
