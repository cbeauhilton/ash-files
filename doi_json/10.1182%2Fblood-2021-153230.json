    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative therapy for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Though HSCT can reverse the SCD phenotype, both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been associated with HSCT. SCD alters renal function thus the impact of HSCT on renal function in SCD patients is a critical area of exploration. Here, we report the effect of HSCT on renal function in people with SCD. This study analyzes data from 195 patients who received HLA-matched sibling or haploidentical HSCT for SCD at Imperial College London (ICL), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). The former is a pediatric cohort and all sites employed a nonmyeloablative conditioning. Patients' renal function was assessed at baseline and annually thereafter for up to 3-years. We examined the prevalence of CKD before and after HSCT, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) trends after HSCT, and the incidence of AKI within 100 days of HSCT. We defined and staged AKI according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria; we calculated eGFR with the CKD- epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation for adults and Bedside Schwartz for children. The median eGFR declined annually but remained within the normal range throughout the follow-up period: the baseline median eGFR was 138 ml/min/1.73m 2 and declined by 7 in the first year of follow-up and by additional decreases of 5 and 3.6 ml/min/1.73m 2 in subsequent years (p-values of 0.07, 0.0002, and 0.0002 for years 1, 2, and 3 for comparison to baseline from regression model of eGFR). No differences in eGFR were seen for covariates in the model: haploidentical vs. matched sibling, engraftment status, gender, or site. The downward eGFR trend may represent an improvement in renal function toward normal as hyperfiltration (eGFR \u2265150 ml/min/1.73m 2 ) was present in 28% of patients at baseline and steadily declined to 7% by 3 years post-HSCT. There was a corresponding increase in patients with normal eGFR (60-149 ml/min/1.73m 2 ) from 59% at baseline to 88% at 3 years post-HSCT. Among the ICL and NIH cohorts (UIC excluded due to use of a different AKI determination strategy), 58% of patients developed AKI in the early post-HSCT period. 67% of AKI cases were mild, stage 1; 25% were moderate, stage 2; and 8% were severe, stage 3 AKI. This study demonstrates that HSCT in patients with SCD is associated with a transient increase in UACR but not associated with a significant increase in CKD prevalence by 3-years post-HSCT. The stability of UACR compared to baseline by the 3-year time point suggests that even more mild renal damage may stabilize after HSCT. While there is a substantial decline in eGFR from baseline to each annual follow-up, the proportion of patients whose eGFR was in the normal range increased as the prevalence of hyperfiltration decreased. Finally, while AKI occurred in more than half the patients in our cohort, the preponderance developed only mild AKI. Therefore, our data indicate that nonmyeloablative HSCT for SCD does not lead to significant kidney dysfunction post-HSCT.
