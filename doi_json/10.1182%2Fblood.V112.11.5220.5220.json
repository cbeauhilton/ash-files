    "abstract_text": "Background: IgM multiple myeloma (MM) are very rare plasmaproliferative disorders representing 0.5\u20131.2% of all cases of MM and < 0.2% of all IgM monoclonal gammopathies. Clinical criterion are not always helpful in differentiating IgM MM from Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. However, the presence of lytic bone lesions, absence of lymphadenopathy and/or hepatosplenomegaly, presence of translocation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus at 14q32 [t(11;14), t(14;16), t(4;14)], and strong expression of CD138 by the plasma cells are useful in the diagnosis of IgM MM. It has been our experience and of others that these cases have an aggressive behavior at presentation, shorter survival than IgG and IgA MM and poor response to therapy for lymphoplasmacytoid lymphomas. We present here 2 cases of IgM MM with a dramatic response to Lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone (Rev/Dex) Results: Baseline patient characteristics at time of diagnosis of IgM MM and therapy outcome are presented in the following 2 tables: Table 1.

On follow up there were insufficient number of plasma cells to perform test Standard: of 20 metaphases, 6 had a complex hypotetraploid karyotype with relative loss of 13q, 14, 15, 16, 20, and 22, and numerous unbalanced rearrangements. FISH: a plasma cell clone with monosomy 13 and IGH/c-MAF fusion, t(14;16). In addition, approximately 60% of plasma cells had a tetraploid clone with the same anomalies as well as relative loss of p53 Bone lesions Multiple non-traumatic spinal fractures and of stenum Several lytic lesions of long bones Renal insufficiency No No Anemia (Hbg g/dL) Yes (8.7) Yes (8.1) Hypercalcemia (Ca mg/dL) Yes (12.5) Yes (11.4) Beta 2 microglobulin (mg/dL) 5.79 8.51 Serum viscosity (cpoise) 5.9 4.8 Case . 1 . 2 .

Lenalidomide-based therapy might abrogate poor prognosis cytogenetics in this unusual subtype of MM (case #2), however, follow up for this patient is still very short.",
