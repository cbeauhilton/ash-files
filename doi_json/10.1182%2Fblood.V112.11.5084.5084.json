    "abstract_text": "Effective treatment options for patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are limited. However, around one-third of patients experience transformation to acute myeloid leukemia, and absent transformation, complications of chronic cytopenias (including infection), and iron-overload syndromes can be fatal. Although 5-azacitidine, decitabine, and lenalidomide have improved treatment options for patients with MDS, these are not routinely used in patients with lower-risk disease. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes are overexpressed in several tumor types including MDS, and regulate transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. Vorinostat (Zolinza \u00ae ) has been shown to inhibit class I and II HDAC enzymes, and has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations of T-cell lymphoma in patients with persistent or recurrent disease, on or following 2 prior systemic therapies. Vorinostat induces cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, or differentiation in a variety of cultured transformed cell lines, and has demonstrated activity against leukemias in in vivo non-clinical models and in phase I and II clinical trials. Efficacy data in these early phase trials prompted an investigation of vorinostat monotherapy in lower-risk MDS. The potency and tolerability of vorinostat suggest it may be effective in the treatment of MDS. Here, we report preliminary results of a randomized phase II study evaluating once-daily and three-times-daily (tid) intermittent dosing schedules of vorinostat in patients with low and intermediate-1 risk MDS. Primary objectives included assessment of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of vorinostat. Eligible patients were aged \u226518 years, had either previously untreated disease, or were \u22654 weeks from any prior treatment regimen (including growth factors). Patients\u2019 performance status was \u22642 on the ECOG performance scale, they had adequate organ function, and were either red blood cell transfusion dependent or had a hemoglobin level of \u226411g/dL at the time of screening, or had platelets \u2264100 \u00d7 10 9 /L at the time of screening. Eligible patients were assigned to 1 of 2 oral dosing regimens: vorinostat 400 mg daily or vorinostat 200 mg tid. Treatment was administered over a 21-day cycle (14 days\u2019 therapy and 7 days\u2019 rest), with patients receiving up to 8 cycles, or until the patient experienced unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or withdrew consent. In total, 18 patients (12 male, 6 female; mean age 67.4 years) have been randomized, including 5 with low-risk MDS and 13 with intermediate-1 risk MDS, as defined by the International Prognostic Scoring System. Of the patients enrolled, 12 (3 low-risk and 9 intermediate-1 risk MDS) were evaluable for response and have received between 2 and 6 cycles of treatment. Stable disease has been reported in all 12 patients, with a reported duration of between 22\u2013146 days (low-risk MDS) and 1\u2013136 days (intermediate-1 risk MDS). A total of 11/18 (61%) patients have discontinued, 2 due to adverse events (1 event of grade 4 neutropenia [unrelated to study medication] and 1 event of grade 3 neuropathy [drug related]), 1 due to deviation from protocol, 4 due to lack of efficacy, 3 due to physician decision, 1 due to progressive disease, and 1 because of withdrawal of consent. Most adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders: diarrhea in 10 patients (7 grade 1, 3 grade 2), nausea in 9 patients (6 grade 1, 3 grade 2), and vomiting in 6 patients (5 grade 1, 1 grade 2). Grade 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia were observed in 2, 1, and 1 patients, respectively; however these were unrelated to study medication. Data from this study indicate that vorinostat administered in a 21-day cycle has acceptable safety and tolerability.",
