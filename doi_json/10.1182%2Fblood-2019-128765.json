    "abstract_text": "Background: Gene therapy for hemophilia offers the possibility of ameliorating the disease severity to a milder or functionally curative state through a single treatment. AMT-061 is an investigational gene therapy for hemophilia B comprising an adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) vector containing a codon-optimized Padua variant human factor IX (FIX) gene with liver-specific promoter. Aims : Confirm that a single dose of AMT-061 will provide a minimum-therapeutic response of FIX activity 6-weeks post-dose in participants with severe or moderate-severe hemophilia B. Here, 1 year of follow-up will be presented for the first time. Methods: Phase 2b, open-label, multi-center trial (NCT03489291) in adult males with FIX \u22642% and without active hepatitis or uncontrolled HIV. Participants were not excluded based on neutralizing antibodies to AAV5. Participants received a single intravenous dose of AMT-061 (2x10 13 gc/kg) and will be followed for 5-years. The primary endpoint was FIX activity at Week 6. Secondary endpoints include e-diary recordings of bleeds and FIX concentrate use, laboratory parameters, joint health, patient-reported outcomes, and adverse events (AEs). Results : All participants had FIX \u22641% (severe or moderately-severe FIX deficiency), required routine FIX prophylaxis, and had neutralizing activity to AAV5 at baseline. Following AMT-061 treatment, FIX activity increased rapidly ( Figure ) to a mean of 31% at Week 6. At Week 36, mean FIX activity increased further to 45% with FIX activity levels of 54%, 30% and 51% in participants 1-3 respectively. As of 36 weeks, there were no bleeds post-treatment and no requirement for FIX replacement aside from protocol-specified use for perioperative management in participant 3. There were no clinically significant elevations in liver enzymes and no participants required steroids related to the treatment. One participant experienced 2 mild AEs possibly related to treatment shortly after dosing (self-limiting headache and slightly elevated CRP). One patient had hip surgery due to worsening of pre-existing avascular necrosis deemed unrelated by investigator to AMT-061 and received FIX per protocol according to standard clinical practice. No participant developed inhibitors to FIX. Updated results to 52 weeks of follow-up will be presented. Conclusions : Sustained elevation of FIX activity into the mild-to-normative range were observed in all participants 36 weeks after treatment with AMT-061. AMT-061 was safe and well-tolerated with no requirement for immunosuppression. These data support the ongoing Phase 3 study.
