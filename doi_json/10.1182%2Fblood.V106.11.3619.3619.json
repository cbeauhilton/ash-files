    "abstract_text": "We have been able to direct the differentiation of CD34 pos cells derived from H9 and H7 hESCs toward lymphoid lineages using OP9 or OP9DL1 feeder layers. OP9 and OP9DL1 stromal cell lines are consistently better than S17 or OP9-jagged in inducing hESC-derived CD34 pos cells at different time points in culture. By day 14 in culture, about 8.7% and 7.9% of differentiated H9 hES cells harvested from co-cultures in OP9 or OP9DL1 respectively were CD34 pos . The CD34 pos cells in these cultures were enriched for by magnetic sorting. The clonogenic potential of differentiated hES cell suspensions and of sorted CD34 pos cells were determined using methylcellulose colony assays. The highest clonogenic potential was noted after 18 days in co-culture when we obtained 142 +/\u2212 31 and 218 +/\u2212 38 colonies per million cells plated from OP9 and OP9DL1. Selection for CD34 pos cells enriched the clonogenic activity 27-fold. Morphologic analyses of representative colonies from the methylcellulose cultures showed cells of the erythroid, myeloid, lymphoid and megakaryocytic lineages were generated. Directed differentiation of CD34 pos cells towards lymphoid lineages was initiated by replating the sorted CD34 pos cells onto irradiated OP9 or OP9DL1 stromal cells supplemented with stem cell factor (SCF), IL3, IL7 and Flt3L. Under these conditions, B lineage (CD19 pos ) and myeloid lineage (CD14 pos or CD15 pos ) cells were observed when CD34 pos cells were grown in OP9, and T lineage cells were observed when CD34 pos cells were grown in OP9DL1. CD4 pos CD8 pos cells were evident after 12 days of secondary culture in OP9DL1 and were prominent by day 20. Only a few of the CD4 pos , CD8 pos and CD4 pos CD8 pos cells, however, were noted to be CD3 pos . Addition of SCF + IL3, SCF + Flt3L, or SCF + Flt3L + IL7 at initiation of hESC differentiation increased the percentage of CD34 pos cells and/ or increased the hematopoietic (clonogenic) potential of sorted CD34 pos cells. CD34 pos cells derived from hESCs grown in OP9DL1 for 14 days and replated in OP9DL1 supplemented with Flt3L + IL7 +/\u2212 SCF generated the highest percentages of CD4 pos CD8 pos cells. Additional phenotypic analyses and functional studies of sorted CD4 pos , CD8 pos and CD4 pos CD8 pos cells generated from these cultures are needed to further characterize their lymphoid properties.",
