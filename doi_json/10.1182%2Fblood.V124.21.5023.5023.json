    "abstract_text": "Most patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) respond to first line therapy. Rarely there are patients who remain with very low platelet counts despite administration of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG). A protocol at our institution (colloquially known as the \"platelet boilermaker\") for these refractory patients is to give 1 gram/kg of IVIG continuously over 24 hours concurrent with one unit of plateletpheresis product given over 6 hours repeated times 4. We examined the charts of 10 patients in the past 6 years who have received combined therapy. 70% were male; all were refractory to steroids and IVIG. Results are in table: Abstract 5023.

GIB - gastrointestinal bleeding 9/10 patients had at least a transient rise in platelets greater than 30x10 9 /L - 5 patients underwent emergent splenectomy with no bleeding complications. The patient with ICH had no extension and while the other patients who responded had cessation of bleeding. In summary for patients with IVIG refractory ITP who either have bleeding or need urgent splenectomy combined continuous platelets/IVIG is a therapeutic option.
