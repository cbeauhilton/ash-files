    "abstract_text": "Although the quantification of MRD by PCR or flow cytometry (FC) is of proven prognostic value in ALL, both methods were never compared in adults. Since 3- to 4-color FC showed equal or inferior sensitivity to PCR in childhood ALL, we herein prospectively compared six-color FC (6C-FC) at initial diagnosis and during early follow-up in adult ALL to RQ-PCR as reference method. Diagnostic samples from 70 consecutive ALL patients (pts) (22 T-, 48 B-lineage; 18 to 71 yrs) were screened by 14 different multiplex immungene consensus PCRs as published (Bruggemann et al., Blood, 2006) and simultaneously by 8 different 6C-FC combinations which included a total of 29 different antibodies. At least one of the consensus PCRs revealed monoclonality in 64/70 pts (91 %), whereas immunophenotypic aberrations could distinguish ALL from benign hematopoiesis in 67/70 cases (96 %). 6C-FC was positive in all PCR negative samples, while PCR was successful in all samples lacking immunophenotypic aberrations. The standardized 6C-FC method revealed a median of 4 immunophenotypic aberrations per pt (range 1 to 8). The most frequently observed aberrations in B-lineage ALL included CD58++ (76 %), CD11a++(50%), CD22++ (44 %), low CD38 (50%), and KORSA+ (35 %). Tdt+cytoplasmatic(cy)CD3+ hallmarked 86% of T-lineage ALL cases which were additionally characterized by CD7+ (100%), surface(s) CD3- (90%), CD99+ (52 %), and CD1a+ (38 %). Up to now, RQ-PCR assays have been established for 38 pts (median sensitivity 10 \u22124 ; range 10 \u22125 to 10 \u22122 ) thus allowing for comparisons of MRD assessments to 6C-FC in 155 follow-up samples. 110/155 (71 %) samples were collected during the first 4 therapy months. 6C-FC marker combinations for follow-up always included CD34/CD10/CD19/CD45 in B-lineage and TdT/cyCD3/sCD3/CD5 in T-lineage ALL. Stainings were individualized by adding 2 pt-specific markers each to up to 3 tubes. A total of 155 follow-up specimens comprised 13 FC-/RQ-PCR+ (8 %), 4 FC+/RQ-PCR- (3 %), 88 concordantly negative (57 %), and 50 concordantly positive (32 %) samples. Due to extremely low MRD, in 11/13 FC-/RQ-PCR+ samples (85 %) the results of RQ-PCR were qualitatively positive only, but not accurately quantifiable. The minimum MRD level detectable by 6C-FC was 3x10 \u22125 , as proven by a concordantly positive RQ-PCR result. MRD levels obtained by both methods correlated well (Spearman r = 0.85; p < 0.0001) in follow-up samples that were positive both by RQ-PCR and by 6C-FC. The median ratio between 6C-FC and RQ-PCR MRD results was 0.48 (range 0.012 to 113). In 11% of samples the ratio between MRD levels obtained by the two methods differed more than tenfold. Our novel standardized 6C-FC approach is highly sensitive for MRD assessments in adult ALL. Our results suggest the applicability of 6C-FC in a multicenter setting, an excellent specificity, a good quantitative correlation and a similar sensitivity when compared to RQ-PCR. Longer follow-up and the inclusion of more samples in particular from later time points are required to decide whether or not the two methods are of comparable clinical significance.",
