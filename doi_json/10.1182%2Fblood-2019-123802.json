    "abstract_text": "Objective: To determine the immunophenotyping of a population of blood donors, intended to build a database for transfusion medicine. 2) To make available to patients with chronic diseases that are systematically dependent on blood transfusions as compatible as possible in ABH, Rh (DCcEe) and Kell 1 antigen systems. Method: A cross-sectional study was carried out on 11,664 blood donors for the ABH system typing and of these, 1255 blood donors were selected randomly for the determination of blood group antigens of the Rh system and Kell antigen. Blood centrifugation methods, centrifuge hemolysis tube test and indirect Coombs test were used for blood typing. The results obtained were compared by the Chi-square test. A level of statistical significance of p \u2264 0.05 was considered. Results: Antigenic frequencies for the ABH system found: the frequency found for the blood group O 48.8%, the frequency found for the blood group A 35.4%; the frequency found for the blood group B 10.6% and the frequency found for the blood group AB 3.2%. In the Rh-Hr system the most frequent antigens found: e 94.5%, D 88.9%; c 80.6; C 56.4%; E 26.3%. For the Kell antigen, the frequency found was 6.7%. The most frequent phenotypes found were DCcee 23.3%; ddccee 18.1%, DCCee 16.7%; Dccee 11.0%; DCcEe 10.2% and DccEe 8.8%. The lowest frequency was found: DCcEE 0.64% and ddCcEe 0.08% Conclusion: The antigenic and phenotypic frequencies found show the great importance and necessity of the immunophenotyping of these antigens of blood groups in order to transfuse them, making them as compatible as possible, thus reducing the risk of alloimmunization. Due to the great miscegenation of our population, we find different frequencies in each region, making initiatives in this regard more relevant.
