    "abstract_text": "Phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3K\u03b3) in neutrophils plays a critical role in the directed-migration of these cells into inflamed tissues. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of the endothelial component of PI3K\u03b3 activity relative to its leukocyte counterpart in supporting neutrophil interactions with the inflamed vessel wall. Despite the reconstitution of class Ib PI3K function in neutrophils of p110\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 mice, we observed a 45% reduction in accumulation of these cells in an acute lung injury model. Mechanistically, this appears to result from a perturbation in selectin-mediated adhesion as manifested by a 70% reduction in WT neutrophil attachment to and 17-fold increase in rolling velocities on p110\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 microvessels in vivo in response to TNF\u03b1. This alteration in adhesion was further augmented by a deficiency in p110\u03b4, suggesting that the activity of both catalytic subunits is required for efficient capture of neutrophils by cytokine-stimulated endothelium. Interestingly, E-selectin-mediated adhesion in p110gamma] \u2212/\u2212 mice was impaired by > 95%, but no defect in NF-\u03baB-induced gene expression was observed. These findings suggest a previously unrecognized partnership between class I PI3Ks expressed in leukocytes and endothelium, the combination of which is required for the efficient trafficking of immunocompetent cells to sites of inflammation.",
