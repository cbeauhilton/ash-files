    "abstract_text": "Abstract 491 Introduction: Chronically-anticoagulated patients with active cancer (Ca) often require temporary interruption of warfarin for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. While such patients may be at increased risk for periprocedural thromboembolism and bleeding, there are virtually no estimates of these outcomes among Ca patients or the most appropriate periprocedural anticoagulation management. The aims of this study were to estimate rates of these outcomes among Ca patients and to test active cancer and \u201cbridging\u201d low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as potential predictors of these outcomes. Patients and Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, all chronically-anticoagulated patients referred to the Mayo Clinic Thrombophilia Center for periprocedural anticoagulation management over the 11-year period, 1997-2007, were followed forward in time for the outcomes of venous and arterial thromboembolism (VTE; ATE), major bleeding and vital status within 3 months of consultation. Warfarin was stopped 4-5 days prior to the procedure and patients received bridging LMWH according to the estimated risk of thromboembolism and bleeding. All outcome events were centrally adjudicated using pre specified criteria. Results: The total cohort (n=2517) included 500 patients with Ca. Chronic anticoagulation indications included prior VTE (n=1033), mechanical heart valve (n=669), atrial fibrillation (n=530) and other (mainly vascular bypass; n=285). 65% and 64% of patients with and without Ca received bridging LMWH, respectively. Prior VTE was more common among Ca patients compared to those without CA, both in the bridged (56% vs 37%; p<0.001) and the non-bridged (48% vs 39%; p<0.05) groups. The 3 month rate for the composite of VTE, ATE or bleeding was higher among Ca patients compared to patients without Ca (5% vs 2%; p=0.004) due to higher post procedure rates of VTE (1% vs 0.2%; p<0.001) and major bleeding (4% vs 1.7%; p=0.009); the post procedure ATE rates were low in both groups (0.40% vs 0.45%). For the entire cohort, patients receiving bridging LMWH had a significantly higher rate of post procedure bleeding (5% vs 1%; p<0.05). Finally, there were significantly more deaths in Ca patients compared to non-Ca patients (5% vs. 1%; p<0.001). Conclusions: The three-month rates of VTE, major bleeding and death among patients with Ca in whom anticoagulation is temporarily interrupted for an invasive procedure is significantly higher than in patients without Ca, especially the major bleeding rate. Use of heparin increases this rate even farther, suggesting that bridging should be used with caution in patients with active cancer. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
