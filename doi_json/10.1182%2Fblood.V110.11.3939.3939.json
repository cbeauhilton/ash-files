    "abstract_text": "The multimer distribution of Von Willebrand factor (VWF) in plasma is regulated by the specific VWF cleaving protease ADAMTS13, which cleaves at the Y1605-M1606 bond in the A2 domain of VWF under the shear stress, plays paramount roles in mediating platelet adhesion to the subendothelium during vascular damage. Quantitative deficiency or qualitative abnormity in VWF caused by the mutations in the VWF gene leads to von Willebrand disease (vWD). There exist three types of vWD. Type 1 vWD is characterized by the partial quantitative deficiency of VWF and normal multimers. Type 3 refers to complete deficiency of VWF. Type 2 vWD refers to the qualitative deficiency of VWF and is subdivided into types of 2A, 2B, 2M, 2N. Meanwhile, the subtype of 2A vWD is also subdivided into two groups regarding ADAMTS13-dependent proteolysis of VWF. Group I includes the mutations G1505R, S1506L, L1540P, V1607D, which hinder the multimer assembly and diminish the secretion of VWF while group II includes R1597W, R1597Q, G1505E, I1628T, E1628K, which make VWF more susceptible to ADAMTS13 -dependent proteolysis. All these published point mutations cluster in the A2 domain of VWF and the corresponding mutation mechanism upon VWF has been elucidated. We have identified a patient with bleeding symptoms and reduced plasma VWF antigen, factor VIII and ristocetin cofactor activity, compatible with clinical von Willebrand disease. Analysis of proband\u2019s plasma VWF multimers in low resolution agarose gels demonstrated similar results compared to the healthy. The patient carried a heterozygous deletion mutation from position 1648 to 1650 resulting in loss of three consecutive amino acids (ProIleLeu) in the pre-pro-VWF. It has been demonstrated that the minimal substrate for ADAMTS13 is intact VWF73, a region from Asp1596 to Arg1668 of von Willebrand factor. The novel deletion mutation in this patient occurred in the intact VWF73 and its mutated effect upon cleavage by ADAMTS13 could be clarified by further experiments such as in vitro recombinant expression of mutated VWF and might strengthen our understanding of the interaction between VWF and ADAMTS13.",
