    "abstract_text": "The MYB oncogene encodes a transcription factor, Myb, which is essential for normal haemopoiesis and also for the proliferation of most acute leukaemias (reviewed in ref. 1 ). While a number of Myb target genes have been reported previously, these do not completely account for key elements of MYB \u2019s activity, including its pro-leukaemic and differentiation-suppressing functions. We hypothesised that this reflects the fact that previous screens may have not been sufficiently comprehensive and/or employed the most appropriate cell systems. Thus we have embarked upon a program to identify and validate Myb targets critical for these functions. Here we report results from extensive expression profiling studies using a conditionally myb -transformed myeloid cell line, ERMYB ( 2 ). We have used ~44,000-element Illumina Beadchips in conjunction with a kinetic profiling strategy that selects candidates based on rapid, statistically-significant and consistent responses to both activation and inactivation of Myb. This has resulted in the identification of a substantial number of candidate Myb-activated and -repressed genes (381 and 502, respectively). In addition, we have used this cell system to identify candidate Myb-regulated microRNAs. Inspection of the list of candidate Myb-activated genes revealed several previously-described Myb targets including myc, bcl2, gstm1 and mpo , providing additional confidence in our approach. Our focus to date has been on novel candidates that may mediate myb \u2019s ability to enhance proliferation, suppress differentiation and possibly suppress apoptosis. Q-RT-PCR was used as an initial validation step for a number of such targets; to date 13/14 genes identified by array screening have been confirmed by this method in ERMYB cells. A second approach to validation is to confirm correlation with Myb over-expression in a second cell system (FDB-1) ( 3 ). As in primary cells, enforced Myb expression can suppress differentiation and promote proliferation of these cells in the presence of GM-CSF ( 4 ). Amongst the Myb-activated genes are gfi1 and nucleostemin/gnl3, which are involved in stem-cell functions, cellular proliferation and in the case of gfi1 , lineage-specific functions. Strikingly, candidate Myb-repressed genes include several important positive regulators of haemopoietic differentiation and/or negative regulators of proliferation, namely gata3, sfpi1/pu.1, cebpb, junb, klf\u2019s-3,-6 -13 and btg1 . Most of these genes have evolutionarily conserved internal or proximal candidate Myb binding sites. Our progress in validating these by chromatin immunoprecipitation will be presented. Finally, we have identified a number of microRNAs that are potentially regulated by Myb. These include members of the miR-17\u201392 cluster and mir-146b, which appear to be activated and repressed by Myb, respectively. These have been validated by Q-PCR for both the mature miR and the precursor pri-miR transcript. Interestingly, the mir-17\u201392 cluster has been strongly implicated in oncogenesis and cell cycle regulation ( 5 ), while miR-146a/b may have tumour suppressor activity.",
