    "abstract_text": "Abstract 153 Outside-in signal transduction is one of several amplification pathways that platelets employ following their adhesion to components of the extracellular matrix or to multivalent ligands like fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor. Previous studies have shown that outside-in signal transduction initiated by the binding of fibrinogen to its receptor, the integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23, results in the activation of \u03b23-associated Src family kinases (J Cell Biol 157:265, 2002; J Cell Sci 121:1641, 2008) that phosphorylate key tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing adaptor protein, Fc\u03b3;RIIa (Blood 112:2780, 2008). \u201cActivation\u201d of Fc\u03b3RIIa sets off a cascade of events that facilitate assembly and activation of other key signaling intermediates, including the tyrosine kinase Syk and phospholipase C\u03b32. PLC\u03b32, through its lipase activity, generates lipid products that support a multitude of cellular activation responses, including cytoskeletal rearrangements leading to platelet shape change and spreading, secretion of platelet granules, and activation of additional cell surface integrins. Curiously, mice lack the gene encoding Fc\u03b3RIIa, and murine platelets are notoriously poor at sending \u03b1IIb\u03b23-mediated outside-in signals into the cell. The purpose of the current investigation, therefore, was to determine whether enforced expression of Fc\u03b3RIIa in mouse platelets might serve to amplify murine platelet activation downstream of ligand binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23. We found that the spreading of platelets derived from Fc\u03b3RIIa transgenic mice was more robust and extensive compared to that of their wild-type counterparts. ADP- and collagen related peptide-induced granule secretion, as measured by P-selectin exposure, was also enhanced, as was the degree of integrin of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation, as reported by the binding of the activation-dependent monoclonal antibody, JON/A. Taken together, these data provide further support for importance of Fc\u03b3RIIa in transmitting \u03b1IIb\u03b23-mediated amplification signals into the cell, and help to explain the often-observed defect in \u03b1IIb\u03b23-mediated signal transduction in murine platelets.
