    "abstract_text": "While hematopoietic engraftment kinetics are well appreciated after lethal irradiation in the mouse, most observations have been limited to blood samples or terminal examination of marrow or spleen. The development of non-invasive bioluminescence in vivo imaging technology allows a dynamic picture of engraftment and clonal expansion to be defined. We have extended this technology to the process of drug resistance gene therapy. We hypothesized that drug selection would profoundly affect the extent and dynamics of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) engraftment and clonal expansion after lentiviral mediated gene transfer of the P140KMGMT gene into murine HSC. In previous studies, we have shown that P140KMGMT gene containing retroviral and lentiviral transduced bone marrow cells provided significant protection against chemotherapeutic drugs BCNU and TMZ given with BG (O 6 -Benzylguanine), in vitro and in vivo . We generated a bicistronic lentiviral vector containing P140KMGMT gene and firefly luciferase gene linked by 2A sequence of FMDV(Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus), which will cleave itself during ribosomal translation. Whole bone marrow cells was collected from BALB/c mice 4 days after 5-FU treatment and transduced with P140KMGMT-luc lentiviruses at MOI of 1.4. Transduced bone marrow cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated or non-myeloablated syngeneic recipient mice at different cell numbers. Initial bioluminescent signal emerged 6\u20138 days after transplantation in both lethally irradiated and non-myeloablated recipients. The onset of bioluminescent foci after transplantation occurred in a cell dose dependent manner. The initial signal emitted predominantly from bone marrow, especially femurs, humeri and vertebrae during the early stage of clonal expansion. Intense signal appeared in spleen at days 12\u201314 and became weaker or even disappeared by days 20\u201328. Clonal expansion and engraftment greatly increased after a single course of BG+TMZ treatment and initiated strong hematopoiesis in non-myeloablated recipients. Total body bioluminescence intensity of drug treated mice increased 24 fold and 7 fold compared to non-treated mice in both non-myeloablated and lethally irradiated recipients, respectively. A transient phase suggesting migration through the lymphatic system and in the spleen occurred in most mice and was exacerbated by drug selection, but this was less clear in lethally irradiated mice, where engraftment was more confined to the marrow spaces. Bioluminescence in vivo imaging reveals active migration between the bone marrow and the spleen during hematopoiesis. Drug selection has a significant impact on the patterns of engraftment and clonal expansion of HSC and progenitor cells after transplantation."
