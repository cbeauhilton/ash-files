    "abstract_text": "Introduction. A normal compression ultrasonography (CUS) safely excludes proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with a negative predictive value of 97% indicating the need to repeat CUS testing within one week. In 3 studies, the rapid ELISA D-dimer assay at a cut-off of 500 ng/ml did have a sensitivity of 100% for the exclusion of venographically documented distal and proximal DVT irrespective of clinical score. To test this hypothesis we performed a large prospective study in outpatients with suspected DVT. Methods. CUS and a rapid ELISA D-Dimer test (VIDAS, BioMe\u0301rieux L\u2019Etoile, France) were performed in patients with suspected DVT. A negative CUS with a D-Dimer result of 500 ng/ml was followed by a second CUS within one week. Results. The prevalence of DVT 1046 consecutive out patients with suspected DVT was 23,4%. The first CUS was positive in 228 with a rapid ELISA D-Dimer of >500 ng/ml in 227 and of 1000 ng/ml was 5.6% as documented by CUS repeat within on week. Conclusion. A normal rapid ELISA D-dimer test, <500 ng/ml, in outpatients with suspected DVT safely excludes DVT irrespective of clinical score. After a negative rapid ELISA result (<500 ng/ml), CUS is still indicated for safety reasons in patients with suspected DVT and persistent symptoms in search for an alternative diagnosis, or for a rare case of DVT. A negative CUS plus and ELISA D-Dimer result of <1000 ng/ml safely exclude DVT without the need to repeat CUS in 2/3 of patients with a negative first CUS.",
