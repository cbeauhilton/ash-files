    "abstract_text": "Abstract 923 Background: To enhance the response rate with a decrease in myelosuppression that were observed with oxaliplatin, fluradabine, Ara-C, and rituximab (OFAR1) (Tsimberidou et al , J Clin Oncol, 2008;26:196), the daily dose of oxaliplatin was increased from 25 to 30mg, the daily dose of Ara-C was decreased from 1 g/m 2 to 0.5 g/m 2 and the optimal number of days of fluradabine and Ara-C administration was explored (OFAR2). Methods: OFAR2 consisted of oxaliplatin 30mg/m 2 D1-4; fludarabine 30mg/m 2 ; Ara-C 0.5g/m 2 ; rituximab 375mg/m 2 D3; and pelfigrastim 6mg D6. Fludarabine and Ara-C were given on D2-3 (level 1) D2-4 (level 2) or D2-5 (level 3) every 4 weeks. Tumor lysis, DNA virus, and PCP prophylaxis was administered. A \u201c3+3\u201d design was used (Phase I) and and the planned number of patients in the Phase II was 90 (CLL, 60; RS, 30). Results: Overall 102 patients (rel. CLL 67, RS 35) were treated. Twelve patients were treated in the Phase I portion of the study. Dose-limiting toxicities were noted in 2/3 patients at level 3 (G4 diarrhea and G4 sepsis). Level 2 was the maximum tolerated dose. Ninety patients (CLL, 60; RS, 30) were treated in Phase II portion of the study (age > 60 years 67%, 17p del 37.5%, 11q del 15%, 13q del 18%, +12, 17%; neg. 12.5%; unmutated IgVH 81.5%, ZAP70-positive 77%, and CD38 30%, 63%). Response in 80 of 90 patients (Phase II) is shown in Table (too early, n=10).  . RS, N=27 . Refractory CLL, N= 53 . . No. of patients . % . No. of patients . % .

Twenty-nine patients underwent SCT after OFAR2 (response status to OFAR2 at the time of SCT: CR, n=3; nPR, n=2; 15; no response, n=9). With a median follow-up of 20.8 months, the median survival was 19 months (95% CI, 13\u201337+) and the median FFS was 6 months (95% CI, 3.4 \u2013 8.2). Overall, 238 cycles were administered. G3-4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia were noted in 67%, 74%, and 44% of patients (51%, 64%, and 25% of cycles); and G3-4 infections in 19% of patients. Clinical outcomes of OFAR2 were compared with those of OFAR1. In patients with RS, the overall response rate was 41% (11/27) with OFAR2 and 50% (10/20) with OFAR1 (p = 0.57, Fisher's test); the median survival with OFAR2 and OFAR1 was 8.3 months and 18+ months, respectively (p = 0.92, log-rank test); and the respective median FFS was 3.0 months and 4.1 months (p = 0.40, log-rank test). In patients with CLL, the overall response rate was 55% (29/53) with OFAR2 and 33% (10/30) with OFAR1 (p = 0.36, Fisher's test); the median survival with OFAR2 was 21.4 months and 13.8 months with OFAR1 (p = 0.19, log-rank test); and the respective median FFS was 6.6 months and 4.9 months (p = 0.69, log-rank test). Conclusion: OFAR2 induced response in 41% of patients with RS and 55% of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL in the phase II study. Antileukemic activity was also noted in patients with 17p deletion. Although the numbers of patients are small, OFAR1 was associated with a trend towards superior clinical outcomes in patients with RS compared to OFAR2; and OFAR2 was associated with a trend towards superior clinical outcomes compared to OFAR1 in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL.
