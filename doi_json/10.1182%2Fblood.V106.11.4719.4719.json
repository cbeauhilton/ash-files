    "abstract_text": "Patients with stage I-II A non bulky Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (HL) are successfully treated with 2\u20134 cycles of ABVD plus IF radiotherapy (RT). Although the negative impact in DFS and OS of B symptoms and bulky disease(X) is widely accepted, other risk factors such as number of lymph node regions involved or extensive spleen involvement have also been reported. What is the best treatment for such patients? Is radiotherapy necessary? We report here our experience with protocol HD 98 in 62 patients, with stage I\u2013II HL. Since January 98 we have included 30 individuals without risk factors and 32 with one of the following risk factors: B symptoms (n:11), X (n:9), extensive spleen involvement (n:1) and involvement of more than two lymph node regions (n:11). Other patient characteristics were: age: x 31yrs (15\u201369), sex: females 31, males :31. Ann Arbor stage IA :11, IB :1, IIA: 36, IIB :14. Histologic subtypes were: LP: 4, NS: 42, MC: 15, lymphocyte rich :1. Patients with favourable features received 4 cycles of ABVD plus IFRT, those with unfavourable factors received 6\u20138 cycles of ABVD plus RT in areas of bulky or residual disease. Results : 59/61 evaluable patients obtained CR or CRu. Two patients were considered primary resistant. Three patients relapsed at 7, 13 and 30 months after completion of treatment. Autologus bone marrow transplant was performed in four patients. The two primary resistant patients relapsed after the transplant and died with proggressive disease. Those patients transplanted in a chemosensitive relapse are currently in CR. With a median follow up of 46m (13\u201384) 96.7% of the patients are alive, in CR. Conclusions : In our experience patients with unfavourable stages I\u2013II HL are succesfully treated with 6\u20138 cycles of ABVD. In such patients RT might only be necessary in areas of bulky or residual disease."
