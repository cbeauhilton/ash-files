    "abstract_text": "Background: Perifosine is an oral AKT inhibitor which exerts a marked cytotoxic effect on human tumor cell lines. It is currently being tested in several phase II trials for the treatment of major cancers including multiple myeloma. While the proposed mechanism of action relates to downregulation of AKT expression, overepxression of constitutively active AKT does not abrogate perifosine induced cell death suggesting alternative mechanisms. Hypothesis: Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL, Apo2 ligand) effectively kills multiple myeloma cells in vitro after binding to their membrane specific receptors TRAIL-R1 (DR4) and TRAIL-R2 (DR5). It is our hypothesis that DR4/DR5 upregulation occurs in response to perifosine treatment, and thus may be additive with exogenous TRAIL. Materials and Methods: TRAIL-sensitive myeloma cell lines (MM.1S, RPMI8226, MM.1R) and TRAIL- resistant myeloma cell lines (U266) were used in this study. Apoptosis was assessed by annexin-V binding assay using flow-cytometry and cell death was assessed by MTT assay. Recombinant human TRAIL, chimeras of DR4 and DR5 were obtained from R&D systems. Results: Perifosine alone(5\u03bcM and 10\u03bcM) induced apoptosis of MM.1S in 40% and 50% of the treated cells as measured by flow cytometry, that increased to 81% and 91% when 50ng/ml of TRAIL was added to 5\u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM of perifosine. TRAIL alone induced only nominal apoptosis. Use of the TRAIL resistant U266 cell line showed only minimal apoptosis in response to perifosine, TRAIL, or the combination of both agents. Perifosine also induced DR4 and DR5 expression in less than 2hrs upon the Perifosine exposure in MM.1S as shown by RT-PCR. The combination of perifosine and TRAIL was not sequence specific. Furthermore, we observed that the enhanced apoptosis induced by perifosine and TRAIL in combination was almost or partially blocked by the administration of the DR4 and DR5 blocking antibodies only in the case of MM.1S, MM.1R, RPMI8226 TRAIL sensitive cells lines. Apoptosis was completely blocked in the case of U266 TRAIL resistant cell line when the chimera antibodies were used with perifosine alone or in combination with TRAIL. Conclusion and future directions: Perifosine, an agent proposed to function via inhibition of p-AKT and PDK-1, may have other effects on cell cycle regulation and it pro-apoptotic effects may be partially related to the TRAIL pathway. Our data suggests that an additional mechanism of action relates to the effect perifosine has on DR4 and DR5 expression thus directly effecting apoptosis via the TRAIL mediated effects. The limited response the trail resistant cell line U266 cells suggest that the TRAIL resistant myeloma cells have less DR4 or DR5 surface receptors as compared to the TRAIL sensitive cell lines, MM.1S, MM.1R, and RPMI8226 further validating this alternative mechanism. Further experiments such as inhibition of DR4, DR5, and FADD by small interfering RNAs, RT-PCR, the response in primary myeloma cells and also using more TRAIL resistant cell lines to support our preliminary observations are currently in progress.",
