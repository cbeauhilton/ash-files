    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Recent several cytokine studies have shown Th1 polarization of the immune response in Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients. IL\u201310 is most important factor regulating Th1 and Th2 cytokine synthesis and IL\u201310 polymorphism has been implicated in autoimmunity and tumorigenesis. We examined the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter regions of the IL\u201310 genes in patients with ITP, and analyzed the relationship between IL\u201310 SNPs and clinical features. Patients and methods : Seventy-eight patients (male/female; 19/59, median age; 59.4) diagnosed as chronic ITP and 202 healthy controls were included. ITP with severe thrombocytopenia was defined as thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 10\u00d710 9 /L) at initial diagnosis of ITP. ALL patients gave written informed consent about the study. The platelet count was ranged from 1\u00d710 9 /L to 100\u00d710 9 /L at an initial diagnosis. In addition, 53 patients (67.9%) had bleeding tendency, and 20 patients (25.6%) had severe thrombocytopenia. Steroid treatment was given to 48 patients (61.5%), while splenectomy was applied to only 9 patients (11.5%). Genotyping in IL-10-1082G/A, -819C/T, \u2212592A/C was determined by PCR based technique. Genotype and allele frequencies were compared between the study groups using \u03c7 2 -test. The characteristics and laboratory features of the ITP patients with each IL-10 promoter polymorphism were compared using X 2 -tests and student t-tests. Probability values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results : The frequencies of the genotypes were as follows: GG (0%), GA (6%), and AA (94%) for \u22121082; CC (12%), CT (51%), and TT (37%) for \u2212812; CC (12%), CA (51%), and AA (37%) for \u2212592 loci. The frequencies of each haplotype were as follows: ATA/ATA haplotype in 31 patients (40%), ATA/ACC haplotype in 35 patients (45%), ACC/ACC haplotype in 7 patients (9%). No significant differences in the genotype or haplotype frequencies demonstrated between chronic ITP patients and control group. However, patients with \u2212592AA genotypes showed severe thrombocytopenic state at initial diagnosis compared to those with \u2212592CA/CC genotypes (41.4% vs. 16.3%, p=0.01). Furthermore, patients with ATA/ATA haplotype showed severe thrombocytopenic state (38.7% vs. 17%, p=0.03) compared to those without ATA/ATA haplotype. In patients treated with steroids, the overall response rate was 71% with complete response rate of 23.2% and partial response rate of 47.8%. No significant difference was observed in treatment response according to IL-10 polymorphism. Conclusion : In previous investigations, \u2212592AA genotype or ATA/ATA haplotype have been reported to be associated with the lower levels of IL-10 expression. Our data suggest that the group with low IL-10 inducibility (i.e. \u2212592AA genotype, ATA/ATA haplotype) may have more severe thrombocytopenia compared to those with high IL-10 inducibility. It is also reported that low IL-10 inducibility type enhances Th1-type polarization in ITP. Furthermore, Panitsas et al . revealed that higher Th1/Th2 ratio in ITP patients correlate with lower platelet count. Thus, these findings suggest that IL-10 polymorphism reflect the severity of chronic ITP."
