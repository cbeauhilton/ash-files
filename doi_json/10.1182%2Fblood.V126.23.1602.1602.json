    "abstract_text": "Young patients (age < 60 years) with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and no history of thrombosis are considered at low risk of thrombosis and therefore managed on a conservative approach with antiplatelet therapy or even without any treatment. JAK2 V617F and CALR exon 9 mutations are the most frequent molecular alterations observed in ET, with CALR -positive ET being considered a distinct clinical entity due to its higher platelet counts and lower incidence of thrombosis as compared with JAK2 V617F-positive ET. There is some evidence supporting a role for antiplatelet therapy in JAK2 V7617F-positive neoplasms. However, the role of antiplatelet therapy in CALR -positive ET has not been studied. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of antiplatelet therapy in the primary prevention of thrombosis in patients with CALR -positive ET without indication of cytoreductive therapy. For such purpose, 240 patients (107 males, 133 females) diagnosed with ET at a median age of 42 years (range 13-59) were included in a multicenter retrospective study. Initial treatment consisted of antiplatelet therapy (n=109) or careful observation (n=108), whereas 23 patients received cytoreduction since diagnosis and were excluded. During a median follow up of 8 years, 137 patients were started on cytoreductive therapy because of the following indications: age > 60 years (n=10), thrombosis (n=10), bleeding (n=2), microvascular symptoms (n=18), extreme thrombocytosis (n=89), and others (n=8). Median time free of cytoreductive therapy was 3.2 years. Thrombosis-free survival restricted to the time of cytoreductive therapy abstention was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Variables attaining a significant level at the univariate analysis were included in a Cox proportional hazard model. During the period of abstention of cytoreductive therapy, a total of 10 thrombotic events and 8 major bleeding episodes were registered. The probability of thrombosis at 3 years was 5% in patients managed with careful observation and 1% in those receiving antiplatelet therapy (p = 0.2). At multivariate analysis, antiplatelet therapy did not result in a lower risk of thrombosis after correction for age, sex and presence of cardiovascular risk factors. Interaction studies did not identify any subgroup of patients that benefited from antiplatelet therapy in thrombosis prevention. Regarding major bleeding, patients receiving antiplatelet therapy experienced a higher rate than those managed on observation (3-year probability of major bleeding, 5.5% and 0%, respectively, p=0.05). At multivariate analysis, antiplatelet therapy was associated with a tendency towards and increased risk of major bleeding (HR: 7.7, 95%CI: 0.9-66.2, p=0.06) independently of platelet count at diagnosis, age and gender. In conclusion, CALR-mutated low-risk ET patients under cytoreductive therapy abstention may not obtain a clear benefit from antiplatelet therapy since the increase in the rate of bleeding may offset the reduction in the rate of thrombosis Disclosures Garc\u00eda-Gutierrez: Pfizer: Consultancy, Membership on an entity's Board of Directors or advisory committees, Research Funding; BMS: Consultancy, Membership on an entity's Board of Directors or advisory committees, Research Funding; Ariad: Consultancy, Membership on an entity's Board of Directors or advisory committees, Research Funding; Novartis: Consultancy, Membership on an entity's Board of Directors or advisory committees, Research Funding.
