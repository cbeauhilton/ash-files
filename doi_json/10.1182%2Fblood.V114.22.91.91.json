    "abstract_text": "Abstract 91 Through DNA strand breaks resulting from somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination, germinal center (GC) B cells are exposed to a high level of DNA damage stress. At the GC stage of development, B cells are protected against apoptosis by specific expression of BCL6, which functions as transcriptional repressor of genes in the DNA damage response pathway. In the absence of BCL6, GC formation is abrogated. During normal B cell development, BCL6 expression was only found in GCs, where the secondary B cell repertoire is shaped. Extensive DNA damage, however, also occurs during the development of the primary B cell repertoire in the bone marrow. B cell precursors in the bone marrow sustain DNA damage during V(D)J recombination at immunoglobulin heavy and light chain loci. It is currently unclear, through which mechanisms early B cell precursors are protected against extensive DNA damage stress caused by V(D)J recombination. Here we report that BCL6 plays a critical role during early B cell development by protecting pre-B cells from DNA damage-induced apoptosis during V(D)J recombination. At the transition from IL7-dependent to IL7-independent stages of B cell development, BCL6 is activated, reaches similar expression levels as in GC B cells. Compared to IL7-dependent pro-B cells and large cycling pre-B cells, BCL6 mRNA and protein levels in IL7-independent small resting pre-B cells were increased by 60- to 90-fold, respectively. We identified STAT5 as a critical negative regulator of BCL6 downstream of IL7 receptor signaling in pre-B cells. Expression of a constitutively active STAT5 mutant prevented BCL6 upregulation in differentiating pre-B cells at the transition from IL7-dependent to IL7-independent stages of B cell development. BCL6 function was then tested in bone marrow precursor cells from BCL6 \u2212/\u2212 and BCL6 +/+ mice: Comparing the gene expression pattern of BCL6 \u2212/\u2212 and BCL6 +/+ pre-B cells, we found that BCL6 is required for transcriptional repression of the ARF (Cdkn2a), p21 (Cdkn1a), Gadd45a and p53 genes, which all contribute to cellular senescence and cell cycle arrest. In agreement with gene expression analyses, ChIP-chip and single-locus q-ChIP studies identified ARF (Cdkn2a), p21 (Cdkn1a), Gadd45a and p53 as transcriptional targets of BCL6 in pre-B cells. BCL6-dependent transcriptional repression of these genes in pre-B cells is critical because BCL6 +/+ but not BCL6 \u2212/\u2212 pre-B cells were capable to proliferate in vitro and to form pre-B cell colonies in semisolid agar. Of note, peptide-inhibition of BCL6 suppressed growth and colony formation in ARF+/+ but not ARF\u2212/\u2212 pre-B cells, suggesting that ARF-deficiency rescues lack of BCL6 function. We conclude that BCL6-mediated transcriptional repression of ARF is critical for pre-B cell self-renewal. To determine whether BCL6 function is also required for normal early B cell differentiation in vivo, we performed a comprehensive analysis of B cell differentiation stages in bone marrow from BCL6 \u2212/\u2212 and BCL6 +/+ mice. In agreement with previous studies, the overall number of B cell precursors in the bone marrow was only slightly reduced and pro-B cell and large pre-B cell populations were normal. However, the pools of small-resting pre-B cells and new emigrant B cells were reduced in BCL6 \u2212/\u2212 mice by 3- and 7-fold, respectively. While the overall numbers of mature B cells in BCL6 \u2212/\u2212 mice were normal, we found that their clonal repertoire was extremely restricted. Using spectratype analysis, we found a broad polyclonal primary B cell repertoire in BCL6 +/+ mice, whereas the B cell repertoire in their BCL6 \u2212/\u2212 counterparts was strictly oligoclonal. We conclude that pre-B cell self-renewal and polyclonal B cell production critically depends on BCL6. While the self-renewal defect of BCL6-deficient pre-B cells can be numerically compensated by increased proliferation at later stages of development, the diversity of the B cell repertoire in BCL6 \u2212/\u2212 mice is permanently restricted. We conclude that BCL6 is required for pre-B cell self-renewal and the formation of a normal polyclonal B cell repertoire. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
