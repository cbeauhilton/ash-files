    "abstract_text": "Background: Despite recent advances in treatment that have improved the prognosis for patients with multiple myeloma (MM), the disease remains incurable. There is a need for MM treatments with new mechanisms of action. Leflunomide, a commercially available oral immunosuppressive agent that has been FDA-approved since 1998 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was evaluated as a potential MM therapy. The primary mechanism of action is de novo inhibition of pyrimidine synthesis by targeting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), and thus achieving an anti-proliferative effect in B- and T-lymphocytes. A secondary mechanism of action is inhibition of cytokine and growth factor receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity. Methods and Results: Pre-clinical studies of teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide, showed that it inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in MM cell lines (MM.1S, MM.1R, U266, H929, RPMI-8226) and primary MM patients' (CD138+) plasma cells at clinically achievable concentrations (50-200 uM) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We also found that teriflunomide induces cell-cycle arrest in both, glucocorticoid-sensitive (MM.1S) and resistant (MM.1R) MM cell lines at <200 uM. In addition, teriflunomide and dexamethasone synergized in the in vitro growth inhibition of MM cell line MM.1S. To identify MM-associated mRNAs and miRNAs whose expression levels are frequently altered upon teriflunomide exposure, MM cell lines (RPMI-8226, U266, MM.1S, NCI-H929) and CD138-enriched primary plasma cells from two MM patient samples were treated with 200 \u00b5M teriflunomide or DMSO control for 24 h before extraction and purification of mRNA and microRNA. mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq analysis from teriflunomide-treated MM samples revealed that similar changes were present between patient samples and cell lines. A total of 382 genes were found to be differentially expressed (225 upregulated, 157 downregulated). Upregulated genes included those that participate in defense response and negative regulation of cell growth. Genes involved in mitosis, rRNA biogenesis/processing, and immune response were generally downregulated. Analysis of microRNA-seq data from these samples revealed five differentially expressed, mostly newly discovered miRNAs that have unknown function. Conclusions: Leflunomide and its analogues demonstrated anti MM effects in vitro as well as synergy with dexamethasone. Based on our promising pre-clinical results we have initiated a single-agent phase I/II clinical trial in patients with relapsed/refractory MM.
