A better understanding of the extent to which patients are affected and how this in turn impacts global health-related quality of life (HRQOL) can improve management of patients. Methods: A survey in 11 centers in the United Kingdom and Germany gathered, among other items, data on HRQOL, measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer's (EORTC) generic cancer and MM modules (QLQ-C30 and QLQ-MY20 scales), from a cross-section of patients with multiple myeloma at various phases of the disease. The QLQ-C30 is comprised of a global QOL domain, 5 functional and 3 symptom domains, and 6 AE items; the QLQ-MY20 includes scales for disease symptoms, treatment side-effects, future perspective and body image. This analysis aimed to explore the association between individual QOL scales (from QLQ-C30 and QLQ-MY20) and global QOL. Values for each scale range from 0 to 100; higher values indicate better HRQOL for the global, functional, future perspective and body image scales, and worse HRQOL for the AE items, symptom domains, disease symptoms and side-effects scales. Scoring of the QLQ-C30 and MY-20 scales was described previously by Fayers et al. [i] and Cocks et al. [ii] respectively. The distribution and correlations (Spearman) between the various scales was explored. Moreover, a multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to assess the association between individual scales and global QOL (from QLQ-C30) with the aim to identify those that independently impact global QOL. Each scale was first considered alone as a predictor of global QOL; those with a statistically significant association at a p-value \u2264 0.10 were included in a multiple regression model. This was then trimmed to exclude scales that became non-significant (p-value > 0.10). Results: The survey included 154 patients: 63.0% were male and the mean age was 66.4 (SD: 10.0). Mean time since diagnosis was 3.7 years (SD: 3.7), 51.9% were currently on treatment, and 42.9% had at least one prior line of MM therapy. The mean global QOL score was 60.1 (SD: 25.5), with the middle two quartiles of patients scoring between 41.7 and 83.3. Cognitive and emotional functioning scores had means near or above 80, suggesting that these aspects of HRQOL were less affected than role (62.9 (IQR: 33.3\u2013100)), social (63.9(IQR: 33.3\u2013100)) and physical functioning (68.7(IQR:53.3-93.3)). While body image scores were generally high (77.9 (IQR:66.7-100)), future perspective appeared to be relatively more affected (59.9 (33.3-77.8)). Patients\u2019 HRQOL is most affected by pain and fatigue (based on symptom and AE scales of the QLQ-C30), with means above 30, followed by insomnia and dyspnoea with means above 20, while diarrhea and nausea/vomiting scales had the lowest mean scores (below 10). The Disease Symptom (23.3 (IQR:0-38.9)) and Side Effect scale scores (19.5 (IQR:7.4-29.6)) from the QLQ-MY20 were consistent with the AE and symptom scales from the QLQ-C30. All of the domains except diarrhea and nausea/vomiting individually showed at least moderate correlations with global QOL (Spearman correlations above 0.25 in absolute value), but also exhibited strong correlations between themselves. The final multiple regression model retained physical and social functioning, fatigue, disease symptoms (QLQ-MY20) and future perspective scales (QLQ-MY20), all of which had relatively similar strength of association with global QOL. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the impact of MM and treatment AEs can be seen on various dimensions of patients\u2019 HRQOL, particularly reduced physical and social functioning, future perspective and various disease symptoms such as bone pain (as captured by the disease symptoms scale of the QLQ-MY20) and fatigue.
