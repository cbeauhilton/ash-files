    "abstract_text": "Background : Hypomethylating agents (HMA) such as 5-Azacitidine (Aza) have overall responses rate of ~35-50% in acute myeloid Leukemia (AML) and higher risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients (pts). However, eventually all pts develop resistance on therapy. To improve upfront response rates and to address HMA failure, we performed genome-scale RNAi screens targeting genes on chromosomes 5 and 7, recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities in AML/MDS. These screens identified Hedgehog pathway (Hh) genes as potentially targetable vulnerabilities with Aza. Combination experiments with smoothened (SMO) inhibitors (SMO is a central activating gene within the Hh pathway) showed pre-clinical synergy. These and additional published data support the Hh pathway as a targetable vulnerability in AML, and provide a rational for a trial. Methods : A phase I/Ib protocol of the oral SMO inhibitor LDE225 (Sonidegib) in combination with Aza in untreated and relapsed/refractory (rel/ref) AML, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), MDS, or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm overlap pts. Objectives of the phase I part are to determine safety, toxicity and MTD and for the phase Ib part to assess the preliminary overall efficacy. Sonidegib was started at dose level (DL) 0 at 400mg oral daily continuously and Aza at the approved doses (75mg/m2 x 7 days or days 5-2-2) with dose adjustment per label. A classical 3+3 design was used and DLT (CTCAE v4.0) defined as > grade 3 CPK elevation or hepatic or non-hematologic adverse events (AEs) lasting > 7 days or any grade 4 event, except for hematologic toxicities. DLT was assessed after 42 days when steady-state concentrations of Sonidegib were reached. Pharmacokinetic assessments were not performed for this study. Results : Patients and Dose Levels : Between 5/22/2014 and the data cut-off date (7/20/2015), 36 pts were enrolled. Median age was 72 y (range 52-85 y) and 64% were male. Most AML pts (23 of 24) had intermediate or unfavorable cytogenetics and most MDS/CMML pts were in the int.- to high-/very high-risk group (IPSS-R). Six pts were treated at DL-0 of Sonidegib 400mg/day and one DLT of CPK elevation was observed. Another patient had grade 4 neutropenia (which at the time was included in the DLT definition, later removed). Due to overall tolerance of the combination at DL 0 and investigator assessment, despite only 1/6 pts having a formal DLT, DL -1 at Sonidegib 200mg was explored at which 0/3 pts (1 pt non-evaluable) had DLT and the phase Ib portion was opened at DL -1. To date a total of 24 AML (13 newly dx, 11 rel/ref), 11 MDS/CMML (5 newly dx, 6 rel/ref ) and 1 myelofibrosis pt have been enrolled. Safety and Tolerability : An initial safety and efficacy assessment for 25 of the 29 pts treated on the phase Ib (n=26) + the MTD cohort of 200 mg (n=3) and for who at least 2 cycles of treatment follow up was available, showed that all pts experienced at least one grade-3 or 4 hematologic AE with a lower rate in the untreated vs. treated cohort. Other, non-hematologic grade-3 and 4 AEs respectively were seen in 24 and 28% of patients-most commonly hyponatremia and fatigue, known AEs for this drug class. Treatment delays occurred in 28% of pts and Aza or Sonidegib dose reductions in 16%. 23 (79%) pts are alive and 6 have died (21%), with one death while pt was actively treated but was deemed unrelated; 11 pts remain on study, with the remainder showing disease progression (n=3) or taken-off study for other reasons (n=3 each for AEs and did not want further treatment; n=4 other). Efficacy : As of 7/20/15 with a median treatment duration of 2 cycles, 2/5 untreated MDS/CMML pts achieved CR/CRi; 1 HMA rel/ref AML had CR; 1 untreated AML pt each had PR and MLFS. 90% of pts have not progressed. Updated results will be presented at the ASH 2015 meeting; by then all 29 pts will have completed a minimum of 4-6 cycles on study and full efficacy and AE result on all pts will be reported. To date the OS at 6 mo is 77% (95% CI: 44-97%) with a median PFS of 4 mo (range: 2-NR). Many pts in the untreated cohorts have just enrolled. Conclusion : Hh pathway inhibition with the clinically well tolerated SMO inhibitor Sonidegib in combination with Aza in MDS and AML pts is well tolerated with mostly hematologic AEs as expected with early signs of clinical activity in untreated and HMA-failure pts. Full efficacy results of 29 pts and updated safety data will be reported for this first combination trial of a SMO inhibitor in combination with a HMA in MDS and AML pts.
