    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4660 One of the serious complication in hemophilia therapy is the development of high titre inhibitors to FVIII and less often to others coagulation factors. It makes treatment of bleeds very challenging. We report a case of hemarthrosis in hemophilia A pediatric patient with inhibitors, treated with sequential infuson of rFVIIa (rFVIIa, NOVOSEVEN; Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) and plasma activated prothrombin complex concentrate (pd- aPCC, FEIBA; Baxter AG Vienna Austria). rFVIIa and plasma activated prothrombin complex concentrate are, indeed, used as haemostatic bypassing agents to prevent eaemorrages, with the goal of limiting sequelae as arthropathy, or to control quickly heamostasis as intensive on\u2013demand treatment. A 3 years old male patient affected by haemophilia A with inhibitors came to our observation for a traumatic hemarthrosis of the left knee. Clinic examination showed swelling and pain. His inhibitor titre was 29 Bethesda Units. First we infused rFVIIa for seven consecutive days at the dose of 90 ug/kg every 3 hours. This therapy didn't determinate any clinical improvement. Then we infused plasma activated prothrombin complex concentrate for the next consecutive seven days at the dose of 60 UI/kg every 12 hours. At the end of treatment we noticed pain disappearance and reducing swelling. Medical literature recently describes similar paediatric cases treated with sequential infusion of rFVIIa and plasma activated prothrombin complex concentrate. Our positive experience could stimulate to use haemostatic bypassing agents because apparently safe. We encourage to use this therapeutic scheme because it seem to reduce healing times of acute events. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
