    "abstract_text": "Introduction Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a lymphoproliferative malignancy characterized by an uncontrolled growth of lymphoid progenitors of B or T lineage, who evade apoptosis and displace normal hematopoiesis. Based on the pediatric pre-induction steroid, the protocol assessed the impact ALL0288 GIMEMA 7 days pre-induction with steroids, complete remissions (CR). Similar to this study, our institutional protocol also considers the pre-induction with steroids, but unlike the Italian protocol fewer cases steroid responders and a lower rate of complete remissions were recorded. A 36 month follow-up overall survival was 32% The main objective of this study was to evaluate the results at 5 years of follow institutional protocol based on a pre-treatment with steroids HGMLAL07. Patients. We included patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia under morphological criteria French-American-British (FAB) and corroborated by flow cytometry. The criteria for complete remission was seen at 4 weeks of treatment (<5% blasts in bone marrow with normal number of leukocytes and platelets). Prophylaxis central nervous system was carried out by weekly and then monthly lumbar punctures to the maintenance stage. If express the BCR-ABL oncogene was added to treatment Imatinib 400mg PO every 24 hours you first 14 days of each cycle. Materials and methods. Study design. Retrospective cohort study of adult patients treated with institutional protocol HGMLAL07 carriers de novo acute lymphoid leukemia in the period from 2007 to 2015 in the Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Mexico. We excluded patients treated with another induction therapy and those of mixed lineage leukemia. General treatment. It was considered relapse if they had at any time monitoring the presence of more than 10% blasts in bone marrow or isolation in the cerebrospinal fluid. If u have HLA-matched donor, he referred to the area of stem cell transplantation. Statistic analysis. SPSS statistical software version 20.0 was used. Chi-Square test considered significant at p <0.05 (95% CI) was used to test hypothesis testing. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meyer test for comparing groups for overall survival and disease-free survival test was used log-rank2. The COX regression model was used for the risk function between different risk variables Results. Of the 262 patients with LLA de novo, 255 patients met the inclusion criteria and were treated with institutional protocol HGMLAL07, 52.9% were male gender (n = 135) and 47.1% (n = 120) Gender female. The mean age was 31 years (range 16- 80 years), the average for older female compared with male (34 versus 29years, p = 0.001, 95% CI). The average of leukocytes at diagnosis was 56.1 x 10 (9) / L. Phenotypically, most were classified leukemia B-cell (95.3%, n = 243) and the remaining T lineage (4.7%, n = 12). Only 3.1% of cases expressed the oncogene BCRABL1 (n = 8). Finally concluding that 62.7% of cases were classified as high risk (n = 160) and 37.3% (n = 95) and normal risk. Response to induction therapy. Of the 255 patients who started the protocol remission induction in 1.6% of confirmed with CNS infiltration diagnosis (n = 4). The complete remission rate was around 82.7% (n = 211), registering an induction mortality 3.9% (n = 10). A total of 34 patients were considered refractory leukemia (n = 34), requiring a second line treatment. Among the variables that showed the impact of the failure to initial treatment (refractory or death) were the type of risk at diagnosis (p = 0.020) and white blood cell count> 30 x 10 (9) / L (p = 0.001). Mean neutrophil recovery was 28 days and the platelet recovery was at 32 days. The main cause of death was infectious processes, followed by central nervous system bleeding. Postremisi\u00f3n treatment and outcome Of the total patients, 51% (n = 130) presented relapse, the main site bone marrow, followed by infiltration of the central nervous system Prognostic factors that impacted on survival The median overall survival (OS) was 1053 days, with survival at 5 years of follow-up of 29%, overall survival at 5 years was influenced by the type of risk (p = 0.020, 95% CI). None of the risk factors impact on survival at one year. The disease-free survival was 11% at 5 years of follow-up, within the variables that impacted on the SLE, a leukocyte count> 30 (9) / L and age> 35 years directly impacted prognosis (p = 0.006 and p = 0.030, 95% CI respectively).
