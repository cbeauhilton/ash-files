    "abstract_text": "Leukocytes may have a propagating and, possibly, initiating role in sickle cell disease (SCD) vaso-occlusion. In vivo studies suggest that adherent leukocytes capture sickle erythrocytes in the microcirculation and in vitro studies demonstrate an increased ability of SCD neutrophils ( neu ) to adhere to fibronectin, endothelial cells and endothelial proteins. Previous studies suggest that the expressions of the major neu integrins, CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1) and CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) may only be upregulated on the surface of SCD neu following their stimulation, indicating that alterations in integrin function (affinity or avidity) contribute to alter SCD neu adhesion. The objective of this study was to identify the integrins responsible for altered SCD neu adhesion. Neus were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy controls and SCD individuals in steady state over ficoll-paque gradients. Cell adhesion (2\u00d710 6 cells/ml in RPMI) to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) at confluence was assessed using static adhesion assays (30min, 37\u00b0C, 5%CO 2 ). Neus from SCD patients demonstrated a significantly greater adhesion to HUVEC than control neus (20.2\u00b12.8% compared to 11.2\u00b11.0%; n\u22657; p<0.03; Mann Whitney test). Subsequently, cells were co-incubated with adhesion molecule-blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) during assays. Control neu adhesion to HUVEC was significantly inhibited by the anti-CD11b mAb (6.7\u00b11.5%;n=6; P<0.05, paired t test), but not by mAbs against CD11a, the VLA-4-integrin subunit, CD49d, or a non-specific negative control mAb (neg control) (data not shown). In contrast, the adhesion of SCD neus to HUVEC was significantly inhibited by both the anti-CD11a and the anti-CD11b mAbs (20.2\u00b12.8% reduced to 11.4\u00b11.2% and 9.1\u00b11.5%; n=9; P<0.01 and P<0.001, respect.). Interestingly, a mAb against CD49d was also found to significantly decrease SCD neu adhesion to HUVEC (10.4\u00b11.1%; n=9; P<0.01), while the neg control mAb did not significantly affect SCD neu adhesion (data not shown). Following the stimulation of HUVEC with TNF-\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) (3h, 37\u00b0C, 5%CO 2 ) to simulate an endothelial layer under inflammatory conditions, the adhesions of control and SCD neus were increased but statistically similar (38.4\u00b12.9% and 34.4\u00b15.0%; n\u22654, respect.). Under these conditions anti-CD11a and CD11b mAbs significantly inhibited control neu adhesion to HUVEC (reduced to 28.8\u00b12.9% and 19.6\u00b14.6%; n=4; P<0.01 and P<0.05, respect.). In contrast, SCD neu adhesion to HUVEC was significantly inhibited by mAbs for CD11a (19.5\u00b12.6%; n=6; p<0.01) and CD11b (15.2\u00b12.0%; n=6; p<0.001). The anti-CD49d, but not the neg control mAb, also significantly decreased SCD neu adhesion to TNF-\u03b1-stimulated HUVEC (19.5\u00b13.7%; n=6; p<0.05). In conclusion, data indicate that control neu adhesion to endothelial cells appears mainly to be mediated by the Mac-1 (CD11b/18) integrin with a contribution from the LFA-1 integrin (CD11a/18) under inflammatory conditions. In contrast, SCD neu adhesion to endothelium (under both basal and stimulated conditions), at least in vitro , appears to be mediated by the Mac-1 and LFA-1 integrins and, interestingly, by VLA-4 (CD49d/CD29), an integrin found expressed at low levels on neus during certain inflammatory conditions. We speculate that alterations in the affinity/ avidity of these molecules contribute to SCD neu adhesion. Approaches to inhibit the adhesion of all three integrins may be important for preventing leukocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium and, in turn, vaso-occlusion.",
