    "abstract_text": "Abstract 955 Renal impairment (RI) is a common complication of multiple myeloma (MM) and is associated with increased mortality. High dose dexamethasone-based regimens have been extensively used for the initial management of patients with MM presenting with RI. Recently, novel agent-based regimens have been introduced in the frontline management of MM. The purpose of our analysis was to assess the effect of novel agent-based regimens on the rate of RI improvement and compare their efficacy with conventional chemotherapy (CC) plus dexamethasone (Dexa) in newly diagnosed MM patients. Over the last decade, 82 patients with newly diagnosed MM and RI, defined as creatinine clearance (CrCI) 60ml/min. Renal partial response (RPR) was defined as an increase of CrCI from30 ml/min (p=0.002, OR: 6.1, 95% CI 2.5-22.5) were independently associated with a higher probability of RCR+RPR. The median time to RPR was similar for patients treated with IMiDs compared to CC plus Dexa-based regimens (2.2 months for Group A, 1.5 months for Group B, p=0.587) but it was significantly shorter for Group C (0.7 months, p=0.017). Other factors associated with a shorter time to \u2265RPR included CrCl>30 ml/min (p=0.039) and age30 ml/min (p=0.006, OR: 2.5 95% CI 1.3-4.5) were independently associated with a shorter time to \u2265RPR. In landmark analysis (time was one month in order to reduce bias due to early deaths), rapid improvement of renal function (\u22641 month) was associated with a trend for a longer survival compared to patients who achieved renal response later (>1 month) (47 vs. 21 months, p=0.19). Myeloma response to treatment was 58%, 68% and 79% for the three treatment groups respectively and was associated with renal response (p=0.024), though less strongly with a major renal response (p=0.061). Our data indicate that novel agent-based regimens can improve renal function in most patients; furthermore bortezomib-based regimens improve renal function to a higher degree and significantly more rapidly than CC plus Dexa-based or IMiD-based regimens even in patients with severe renal impairment. We conclude that bortezomib-based regimens may be the preferred treatment for newly diagnosed myeloma patients who present with renal impairment.
