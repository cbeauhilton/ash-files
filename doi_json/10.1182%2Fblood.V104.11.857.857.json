    "abstract_text": "Previous studies have estimated the U.S. incidence of TTP to be 3.7/10 6 /year, based on U.S. death certificates ( Am J Hem  1995 ; 50 : 84 ), and 3.8/10 6 /year, based on claims submitted to a national health insurer ( Epidemiol  2004 ; 15 : 208 ). These methods are indirect and require extrapolation to determine incidence rates. We estimated the incidence directly from the Oklahoma TTP-HUS Registry. The Registry accrues all patients treated with plasma exchange (PE) for a clinical diagnosis of TTP or HUS (therefore excluding only children with typical HUS) in central, western, and southeastern Oklahoma since the Oklahoma Blood Institute (OBI) is the sole provider for PE in this region of 2.3 million people. Our estimates are based on patients who had their initial episode from 1/1/1996, after routine ADAMTS13 measurements began, to 6/30/2004. During these 8.5 years ADAMTS13 activity was measured in 189 (90%) of 209 consecutive patients. Prior to 1996, the number of patients accrued in the Oklahoma TTP-HUS Registry increased each year, similar to other data ( JAMA  2003 ; 290 : 1351 ); since 1996, there has been no consistent change in the annual number of patients accrued.

The incidence of patients with idiopathic TTP-HUS (3.92/10 6 /year) was similar to the previous reports for TTP. The incidence of patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (<5% activity) was 1.37/10 6 /year. For all patients with TTP-HUS the incidence of patients living in an urban area was 1.4-fold the incidence of patients living in rural areas. The rate of urban excess was greater for patients with idiopathic TTP-HUS (1.8-fold) and patients with ADAMTS13 deficiency (3.2-fold) (data not shown). Part of the urban excess may reflect better recognition of TTP-HUS because of familiarity with the Registry. However much of the urban excess can be attributed to the racial disparity that is greatest among patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. Although the number of patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency in the Oklahoma TTP-HUS Registry is small, the incidence among the Black population was 8.7-fold the incidence among the non-Black population (95% CI, 4.1\u201318.5, p<0.0001). The explanation for why Black race is a risk factor for TTP is unknown, but may be related to the reasons why there is a greater prevalence of other vascular and thrombotic diseases among Blacks.",
