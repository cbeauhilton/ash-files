    "abstract_text": "Objecitve: To investigate the feasibility ofxenotransplant leukemia model using by zebrafish, and lay the foundation for the study of acute myeloid leukemia and the screening of the drugs for targeting therapy of acute myeloid leukemia. Methods: Acute myeloid leukemia cell line KG1a was labeled with red fluorescent dye-MitoRed, then, the labeled cells was injected into the yolk sac of zebrafish embryos. Morphology observation, cell counting and histopathological detection were used to analysis the infiltration and metastasis of KG-1a cells in zebrafish. Results: KG1a cells could proliferate and gradually spread to the entire abdominal cavity of the zebrafish After KG1a cells were injected into the yolk sac during 1-7 dpi, the results of cell counting in vitro also proved a signification proliferation of KG1a cells in zebrafish, suggesting that the implanted leukemia stem cells could survive, proliferate and spread in zebrafish. Further study detected the implanted cells could transfered to the liver of zebrafish, these cells showed the signature of KG1a cells by hematoxy -lin -eosin(HE) staining. Conclusions: Human acute myeloid leukemia cells KG1a could survive, proliferate and migrate in zebrafish, suggesting xenotransplant leukemia model using by zebrafish is feasible. This model may provide benefit for the study of acute myeloid leukemia and the screening of the drugs for targeting therapy of acute myeloid leukemia.
