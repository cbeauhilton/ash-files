    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1938 Background: Carfilzomib (CFZ), a selective, epoxyketone proteasome inhibitor, produces potent, sustained proteasome inhibition and lacks many of the off-target activities associated with bortezomib (BTZ). Durable single-agent activity with CFZ has been observed in patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM) who have received multiple prior therapies as well as in pts with advanced stage disease or significant comorbidities (Jagannath et al . ASCO 2009 Meeting. Abstract 8504). PX-171-004, is an ongoing Phase 2 study of single-agent CFZ in pts with relapsed or refractory MM following 1\u20133 prior therapies. Here we present updated data on the BTZ-nai\u0308ve pts and report on activity observed in pts with significant comorbidities or poor-risk cytogenetic or FISH markers for myeloma. Methods: Enrolled pts received either 20 mg/m 2 for all treatment cycles, or a stepped-up, dose-escalating regimen of 20 mg/m 2 for Cycle 1 and 27 mg/m 2 for all treatment cycles thereafter. CFZ was administered on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16 every 28 days (one cycle), for a maximum of 12 cycles. Dexamethasone, 4mg, was administered prior to CFZ in Cycle 1 only. For the present analyses, pts were stratified according to several baseline criteria including ECOG performance score, cytogenetic or FISH markers of high-risk disease per mSMART criteria [del17p, t(4;14), t(14;16), del13 by karyotype and hypodiploidy] and serum \u00df 2 -microglobulin. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) per International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma. Results: Data are available for 110 BTZ-nai\u0308ve pts. Baseline pt characteristics included: 60% of ECOG PS \u22651; 53% baseline neuropathy Grade 1/2; 30% moderately impaired renal function (CrCl <60 mL/min), and 17% diabetes. Approximately 13% of pts had cytogenetic or FISH markers of poor prognosis. The ORR for the entire BTZ-nai\u0308ve population was 48%; the ORR for BTZ-nai\u0308ve pts receiving 20\u201327 mg/m 2 was 54%. The ORRs stratified according to dose and baseline measurements are detailed in the following table . Table 1:  . N . ORR n (%) .

Grade 3/4 AEs occurring in >5% of pts included lymphopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, thrombocytopenia, anemia and fatigue. Of note, there were no discontinuations for peripheral neuropathy and only 1 pt with impaired renal function at baseline was discontinued for creatinine increases. Twenty-four pts remain on study and 23% have completed the protocol-specified 12 cycles of therapy. Seventeen pts (20%) elected to continue CFZ on an extended treatment protocol (PX-171-010); no cumulative toxicities have been noted. Conclusions: Single-agent CFZ achieves high response rates in BTZ-nai\u0308ve pts with relapsed myeloma, with minimal neuropathy, even in the setting of high-risk disease. In addition, single-agent CFZ continues to demonstrate long-term tolerability even in pts with comorbid conditions, including renal insufficiency and diabetes, who may benefit from a steroid-sparing treatment regimen. The data from this ongoing trial show that CFZ is a promising new treatment for multiple myeloma in the relapsed or refractory setting. Disclosures: Vij: Onyx: Honoraria.
