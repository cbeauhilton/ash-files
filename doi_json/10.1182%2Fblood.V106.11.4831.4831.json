    "abstract_text": "The major mechanism for resistance to imatinib mesylate (IM) is the onset of ABL point mutations altering functional inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity by IM. Biochemical, cellular assays and clinical studies have demonstrated that different BCR-ABL mutations exhibit various degrees of resistance, and mutations occurring in the ATP-binding loop may be correlated with subsequent disease progression. In this study, we investigated the status of the K247R ABL polymorphism and correlated it to disease outcome. Patients and methods: Two patients (P1 and P2) were diagnosed with CML based on peripheral blood findings, karyotyping analysis (showing t(9;22)(q34;q11)) and molecular analysis for BCR-ABL (indicating M- BCR fusion transcripts) in 2,000 and 1,994, respectively. P1, a 54 years old male, enrolled in the Novartis IRIS study, was randomly assigned to the interferon + AraC arm after informed consent. The patient achieved a complete hematologic remission (CHR) at 3 months and a complete cytogenetic response (CCR) at 24 months. At time of cytogenetic relapse (2 years later), P1 had never received IM which was introduced in April 2,005. P2 received IM (400mg to 600mg/day) during 82 months and had shown only CHR during 14 months with no MCR. Epithelial cells were collected in the mouth through sterile foam tipped applicators for both patients. DNA was obtained from blood samples of 232 individuals, including 124 patients with CML, 72 patients with acute myeloid leukemias (AML) and 36 normal healthy donors. The K247R change was studied by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique (AluI restriction enzymatic site abolished) and was confirmed by direct sequencing. Results: Both patients, showing the K247R substitution located close to the P-loop, were retrospectively investigated during disease progression. We found that this change accounted for 100% of the BCR-ABL transcripts at CML diagnosis (and in all the further samples) for P1 (no material was yet available from P2 at this time) and for 50% of the ABL gene in extracted DNA from epithelial cells in the 2 patients. P1, despite of the K247R substitution received IM (400 mg/day) and achieved a CHR, a CCR and a good molecular response (one log reduction after two months of IM). IM resistance observed in P2 was probably due to the presence of an additional F317L mutation, known to induce a very strong resistance to IM. The F317L mutation accounted for 100% of the BCR-ABL transcripts at the resistance, was absent in DNA from epithelial cells. The screening showed the K247R exchange in 1 normal subject (heterozygote), in 2 CML patients (P1 and P2: at heterozygous state in normal cells and at homozygous state in BCR-ABL transcripts) and in none AML samples. According to that, the incidence of this polymorphism seems to reach nearly 1 to 1.5%. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the K247R substitution in ABL tyrosine kinase domain is not a mutation leading to IM resistance but only a rare polymorphism. Detailed analysis of this polymorphism status will be reported.",
