    "abstract_text": "Abstract 578 MLN4924 is an investigational small molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme that has shown clinical activity in a Phase I clinical trial in Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). To identify potential combination partners of MLN4924 we performed a high-throughput viability screen in AML cells with 40 approved and investigational agents. In vitro characterization of AML cell lines revealed two distinct cell cycle phenotypes suggesting alternate mechanism of action following MLN4924 inhibition of NAE. One group demonstrated moderate S-phase accumulation with greater than 4N DNA content consistent with DNA-rereplication as a result of CDT1 dysregulation. The second group demonstrated distinct and rapid accumulation of subG1 cells without S-phase accumulation or DNA re-replication suggesting induction of apoptosis and cell death. These observations led us to choose two cells lines representative of each mechanism to understand potential for synergy in AML cells. Two hypomethylating agents were included in the screen (decitabine and azacitidine) and were found to be synergistic with MLN4924 by Combination Index and Blending Synergy Analysis. These data were confirmed with a second NAE inhibitor that is structurally dissimilar to MLN4924. The combination of azacitidine and MLN4924 were shown to result in significantly increased DNA-damage and cell death compared to single agent alone as measured by Western Blotting and FACS analysis of cell cycle distributions. In vivo studies were performed in HL-60 and THP-1 xenografts using MLN4924 on a clinically relevant dosing schedule twice weekly. Single agent azacitidine at its Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) had minimal activity in the HL-60 model and was combined with a sub-optimal dose of MLN4924 that when combined induced complete and sustained tumor regressions. The mechanism for the apparent synthetic lethality in this in vivo model is currently under evaluation; however it is supported by a dramatic elevation in DNA damage and cleaved caspase-3 in vivo in the combination arm. A second xenograft model (THP-1) that was also insensitive to single agent azacitidine treatment underwent complete and sustained tumor regressions when combined with MLN4924. Thus MLN4924 and azacitidine can combine to produce synergistic antitumor activity in pre-clinical models of AML. Coupled with their non-overlapping clinical toxicities these data suggest the potential for future combination studies in clinical trials. Disclosures: Smith: Millennium Pharmaceuticals: Employment.
