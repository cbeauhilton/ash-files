    "abstract_text": "OBJECTIVE: To detect the expression of \u03b2-catenin in mononuclears of bone marrow of healthy people, primary and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma(MM), and analysis the clinical date and the curative effect of the MM patient, to open out the clinical significance of the expression of the \u03b2-catenin in MM. METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Wes tern blot were used to detect mRNA and protein expression of \u03b2-catenin in bone marrow samples of 12 primary MM patients, 14 relapsed/refractory MM patients, and 11 healthy people. RESULTS: The positive rates and the expression levels of \u03b2-catenin mRNA were significantly lower in healthy people than in MM patients (27.3% vs. 88.5%, 0.22\u00b10.09 vs. 0.80\u00b10.15, P <0.01), the expression level of \u03b2-catenin mRNA(\u03b2-catenin/\u03b2-actin) was significantly lower in newly diagnosed patients than in MM patients (0.7196\u00b10.11 vs. 0.8517\u00b10.16, P <0.05). \u03b2-catenin protein were not detected in all of the healthy people; while the positive rates of \u03b2-catenin was 69.2% in MM patients (P <0.01), and its expression levels was significantly higher in relapsed/refractory patients than in primary patients (0.3231\u00b10.11 vs. 0.2065\u00b10.08, P<0.05). In 10 primary MM patients which can be evaluated the curative effects, the expression rate in no response patients was significant lower than in response patients (14.3% vs. 100%, P <0.05). To stage the patients, the statistics show the expression of \u03b2-catenin protein in Durie/Salmon stage III was significant higher than stageII(87.5% vs. 40%, P <0.05) and in ISS stage III was significant higher than lor IIstage(100% vs. 45.5% or 33.3%). CONCLUSION: To analysis the relationship between \u03b2-catenin and \u03b22-MG or serum LDH, we found the \u03b2-catenin protein was positive correlative with the expression level of \u03b22-MG (r=0.688, P<0.01). and serum LDH(r=0.502, P<0.05)."
