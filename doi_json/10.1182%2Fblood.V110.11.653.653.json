    "abstract_text": "The protein-protein interaction between the subunits of the nuclear transcription factor core binding factor, RUNX1 (CBF\u03b1) and CBF\u03b2, plays a critical role in hematopoiesis. Chromosomal rearrangements that target CBF genes are among the most common mutations in leukemia, including t(8;21) found in approximately 12% of cases of AML and resulting in the protein AML1-ETO. We describe the development of small molecule inhibitors of the interaction between RUNX1 and CBF\u03b2. We used virtual screening to identify lead compounds. These leads were used to generate a library of compounds to explore the structure-activity relationships and optimize activity, resulting in the identification of low micromolar IC 50 inhibitors of this protein-protein interaction. We confirmed by FACS FRET that inhibition also occurs in mammalian cells. HEK-293 cells were transfected with Cerulean-Runt domain and Venus-CBF\u03b2. FRET emission from cells was monitored on a flow cytometer to assess binding of CBF\u03b2 and the Runt domain. Results with drug were compared to FRET between Runt and wild-type CBF\u03b2 and FRET between Runt and a mutant CBF\u03b2 with 2 point mutations abrogating binding to Runt. The small molecule inhibitor KG-3-275 inhibited CBF\u03b2 - Runt domain binding in a dose dependent manner (Table 1). Treatment of the t(8;21) leukemia cell lines Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 results in inhibition of proliferation. SKNO-1 cells are inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by KG-3-275 but not by the weak inhibitor KG-1-253 (Fig 1). KG-3-275 does not inhibit the growth of renal tubular and hepatocellular cell lines (Fig 1). Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 undergo apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner upon treatment with KG-3-275 (Table 2). Finally, KG-3-275 shows synergy with ATRA in increasing differentiation of Kasumi-1 cells as measured by CD11b expression, consistent with recent published results establishing a link between AML1-ETO and repression of RAR signaling (Fig 2). These data indicate drugs inhibiting CBF interactions hold promise as targeted agents in the treatment of CBF leukemias.
