    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1273 The maintenance and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are critical for blood cell homeostasis, which is tightly regulated by a variety of factors. In spite of extensive investigation of HSC biology, however, the mechanism of regulation of HSC and progenitor cell division, particularly the unique molecular events controlling the mitosis process during HSC differentiation, remains unclear. RhoA GTPase is a critical intracellular signaling nodal that has been implicated in signal transduction from cytokines, chemokines, wnt/notch/shh, and adhesion molecules to impact on cell adhesion, migration, cell cycle progression, survival and gene expression. Recent mouse genetic studies in keratinocytes and embryonic fibroblast cells showed that RhoA is a key regulator of mitosis. By using an interferon-inducible RhoA conditional knockout mouse model (Mx-cre;RhoA lox/lox ), we have made the discovery that RhoA plays an indispensible role in primitive hematopoietic progenitor differentiation through the regulation of mitosis and survival. RhoA deficient mice die at \u223c10 days because of hematopoietic failure, as evidenced by a loss of bone marrow, splenocyte and PB blood cells. Syngenic as well as reverse transplant experiments demonstrate that these effects are intrinsic to the hematopoietic compartment. RhoA loss results in pancytopenia associated with a rapid exhaustion of the lin \u2212 c-kit + (LK) phenotypic progenitor population (within 4 days after two polyI:C injections). Meanwhile, the lin \u2212 c-kit + sca1 + (LSK) primitive cell compartment is transiently increased in BM after RhoA deletion due to a compensatory loss of quiescence and increased cell cycle. Interestingly, we find that within the LSK population, there is a significant accumulation of LSKCD34 + Flt2 \u2212 short-term HSCs (ST-HSC) and a corresponding decrease in frequency of LSKCD34 + Flt2 + multipotent progenitors (MPPs). Consistent with these phenotypes, the LK and more differentiated hematopoietic cell populations of RhoA knockout mice show an increased apoptosis while the survival activities of LSK and more primitive compartments of WT and RhoA KO mice remain comparable. These data suggest that RhoA plays an indispensible role in the step of ST-HSCs differentiation to MPP cells, possibly through the regulation of MPP cell survival. This hypothesis is further supported by a competitive transplantation experiment. Deletion of RhoA in a competitive transplantation model causes an extinction of donor derived (CD45.2 + ) differentiated cells (myeloid, erythroid, T and B cells) in the peripheral blood. Interestingly, bone marrow CD45.2 + LSK cells are only marginally affected by deletion of RhoA and RhoA \u2212/\u2212 LSK cells are able to engraft into 2 nd recipient, whereas CD45.2 + LK and more differentiated cells are mostly eliminated after RhoA deletion. This effect is associated with a decrease in the survival of CD45.2 + RhoA \u2212/\u2212 LK, but not LSK cells. Further in vitro culture of isolated lin \u2212 progenitors demonstrates that RhoA deficiency results in a failure of cytokinesis, causing an accumulation of multinucleated cells, further suggesting that RhoA is essential for the cytokinesis of hematopoietic progenitors. Surprisingly, the well-defined Rho downstream target, actomyosin machinery, does not appear to be affected by RhoA knockout. We are further exploring the mechanism of RhoA contribution to the differentiation of HSCs by dissecting the signaling and functional relationship of RhoA regulated survival activity and cell cycle mitosis in early hematopoietic progenitors.
