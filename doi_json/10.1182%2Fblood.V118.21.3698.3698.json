    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3698 Background: Randomized trials had demonstrated that rituximab improved outcome in newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma (FL) and this anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody was approved in France since 2004 in combination of chemotherapy (CT) for LF in first line therapy. As these results were obtained in selected patients with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria used in clinical trials, whether the improvement of patient's outcome is valuable in unselected population of FL patients with various medical history, different CT regimens is questionable. We performed a retrospective analysis to evaluate if the management and the outcome of FL have significantly changed in our institution before and after rituximab approval in 2004. Patients and Methods: all adult patients referred for first line LF were included and separated into cohort 1 diagnosis between 1996 and 2003 (103 patients) and cohort 2 between 2004 and 2010 (144 patients). Baseline clinical and biological datas, Follicular Lymphoma International prognostic Index (FLIPI), type of therapy, treatment response, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared. Results: There were no statistical differences in patients' characteristics between the 2 cohorts, including FLIPI score. In cohort 2, 71% received in first line therapy a rituximab based regimen (19% in monotherapy and 52% with CT). In cohort 1, 58% of patients were treated with CT and 10% with rituximab, 2% in monotherapy and 8% in combination with CT. Response rate were significantly improved in cohort 2 compared to cohort 1: complete response rate was 74.3% versus 57.8%, P <.001. With a median follow-up of 115.5 and 46.5 months in cohort 1 and 2, the 2-year PFS was 67% for cohort 1 and 82% for cohort 2 ( P =.0039), respectively. The 2-year OS was also improved between the two periods (98% versus 87%, P =.0007). We could confirm the prognostic value on OS of the FLIPI score in whole series, in cohort 1 before the rituximab era but not in cohort 2. In fact, the 2-year OS was respectively 100% in low risk, 98% in intermediate risk and 95% in high risk (P =.14)/ Conclusions: These datas confirms the improvement of FL patients' outcome observed in clinical trials after the approval of rituximab in first line therapy prescript in a context of daily practice whatever age, medical history, and type of CT.
