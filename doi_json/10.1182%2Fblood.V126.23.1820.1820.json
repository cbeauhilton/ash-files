    "abstract_text": "Background: Tumor cells exhibit elevated ROS levels and cancer stem cells have lower ROS levels than their normal counterparts [Kobayashi et al., 2011]. However, little is known about the effect of ROS levels on multiple myeloma (MM) plasma cell (PC) chemosensitivity. Previously we found that ROS levels are variable in CD138-selected MMPCs from different cases at diagnosis. However, ROS levels in MMPCs from focal lesions (FL, n=42) are lower than PCs from random bone marrow (BM) aspirates (n=192, p=0.02). ROS levels also vary among MM molecular subgroups, with MF and CD2 subgroups having low ROS levels, suggesting that the microenvironment and genetic factors affect their oxidative capacities. We hypothesized that ROS level may reflect the cancer stemness properties of MM cells. We first sought to establish a model to investigate MM cells with different ROS levels and then determine if this property confers cancer stemness and chemoresistance. Methods: We analyzed gene expression profiles (GEP) of primary myeloma cells from newly diagnosed patients with low (n=48) and high (n=48) ROS level by gene set enrichment analysis. We compared viability, proliferation, cell cycle status, drug efflux ability, chemosensitivity, and clonogenic capacity of MM cell lines H929 and U266 with high and low ROS levels, sorted by FACS using H 2 DCFDA. We also investigated whether MMPCs with low or high ROS levels would differ in their sensitivity to BBI-608, a drug that is reported to target STAT3 driven gene transcription and cancer stemness properties in solid cancers [Li et al., 2015] and is currently being tested in hematologic cancers [BBI608-103HEME]. Results: Pathways enrichment analysis revealed that primary MM cases with low ROS had increased oxidative phosphorylation, proteasome activity, and nucleotide excision repair compared to cases with high ROS that had increased glycolysis, and chemokine and calcium signaling pathways. To explore these differences we separated MMCLs into cells not sorted by ROS level (non-ROS sorted), ROS Lo , and ROS Hi groups. After sorting, H929 cells retained significant differences in ROS levels for 48-72 hr and U266 cells returned to basal ROS levels within 24hr. ROS Lo H929 cells had significantly reduced cell number (p<0.0001) compared to non-ROS sorted and ROS Hi cells. Similarly, ROS Lo cells had reduced and ROS Hi cells had significantly increased proliferation index compared to non-ROS sorted cells (H929-p<0.05, U266-p<0.001). ROS Lo cells also have a significantly larger percentage of cells in S phase (p <0.01) and reduced percentage in G2 (p< 0.001) compared to non-ROS sorted cells. While ROS Hi cells (but not ROS Lo cells) were less sensitive to melphalan compared to non-ROS sorted cells, there was no difference in sensitivity to bortezomib. Examination of ABC transporter efflux activity revealed that ROS Hi cells had increased drug efflux capacity via the multidrug resistance protein MRP1 (p<0.01). ROS Lo cells showed greater colony forming capacity, however after serial replating, ROS Hi cells increase colony forming capacity after each passage eventually matching that of ROS Lo cells. Interestingly, if clonogenic cells are re-sorted into ROS Lo and ROS Hi groups between passages, ROS Lo cells retain superior colony forming capacity compared to ROS Hi cells. ROS Lo (IC 50 -0.656\u03bcM) and ROS Hi (IC 50 -0.56\u03bcM) cells had significantly increased sensitivity to BBI-608 compared to non-ROS-sorted cells (IC 50 -0.991 \u03bcM). Cell number was significantly reduced in all 3 groups without significantly affecting viability. The STAT3 target gene, CCND1 is significantly elevated in ROS Hi cells and effectively reduced by BBI-608. After low dose BBI-608 (0.6\u03bcM) treatment, the remaining cells were subjected to colony forming assays. While BBI-608 reduced colony forming capacity to some extent in all 3 groups, ROS Hi cells were most sensitive. Conclusions: Characterization of MM cells with variable ROS levels revealed that ROS Hi cells have greater drug efflux capacity and are more proliferative and chemoresistant, whereas ROS Lo cells have reduced proliferation and increased clonogenic capacity. ROS Lo MMPCs may represent a subpopulation of tumor cells with stemness properties that are enriched in the hypoxic BM niche and in MM focal lesions.
