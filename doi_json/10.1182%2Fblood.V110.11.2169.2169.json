    "abstract_text": "Rapamycin-generated donor Th2 cells attenuate established acute murine GVHD (Foley et al, JI, 2005) and are dependent in part upon IL-4 and IL-10 secretion (ASBMT Meeting, 2007). That is, Th2.rapa cell recipients (Th2 infusion, d 14 post-BMT) had increased survival relative to GVHD controls (post-BMT survival, median days; 33.7\u00b10.4 vs. 24.8\u00b11.2; p=0.0002) whereas recipients of IL-4 or IL-10 knockout Th2.rapa cells did not have increased survival (28.9\u00b10.3 and 24.6\u00b10.2 days, respectively; p=NS). These data indicate that Th2.rapa cells operate through a Th2-type mechanism rather than a Treg cell mechanism; in addition, we found that Th2.rapa cells expressed low levels of the Treg cell transcription factor, Foxp3 (<5% CD4+Foxp3+). Additional experiments were performed to further investigate a potential role of Treg cell biology to Th2.rapa cell therapy. First, we hypothesized that IL-2 therapy may promote Th2.rapa cell expansion and efficacy in a manner analogous to IL-2 promotion of Treg cell responses in vivo. Second, we hypothesized that enrichment of the Th2.rapa cell product with natural (unmanipulated) Treg cells may enhance an anti-GVHD effect. Contrary to our first hypothesis, we found that IL-2 therapy (50,000 IU bid; d14\u201318 post-BMT) reduced the number of splenic Th2.rapa cells at d 19 post-BMT (CD90.1-marked cells, million [M]/spleen; 5.0\u00b10.4 [no IL-2] vs. 2.3\u00b10.4 [+IL-2]; p=<0.001) and increased the number of unmanipulated donor CD4+ cells (CD45.2-marked cells, M/spleen; 16.6\u00b10.7 [no IL-2] vs. 26.6\u00b12.4 [+IL-2]; p=0.004) and CD8+ cells (15.9\u00b11.7 [no IL-2] vs. 23.9\u00b12.4 [+IL-2]; p=0.03). IL-2 therapy also inhibited Th2.rapa cell-mediated cytokine polarization (d 19 post-BMT, pg/ml; IL-4 reduced from 3501\u00b1179 [no IL-2] to 1116\u00b1261 [+IL-2], p=<0.0001; IL-10 reduced from 707\u00b156 [no IL-2] to 288\u00b137 [+IL-2], p=0.0002; and IFN-\u03b3 increased from 81\u00b122 [no IL-2] to 320\u00b197 [+IL-2], p=0.042). Importantly, for Th2.rapa cell recipients, IL-2 therapy reduced post-BMT survival (d post-BMT; 42.0\u00b10.5 [no IL-2] vs. 33.8\u00b11.0 [+IL-2], p=<0.0001). With regard to our second hypothesis, we found that addition of Treg cells to the Th2.rapa cell product (Treg to Th2.rapa cell ratio, 1:10) reduced the number of Th2.rapa cells at d 19 post-BMT (M/spleen; 16.6\u00b11.3 [no Treg] vs. 7.9\u00b11.2 [+ Treg], p=0.0012) and increased the number of unmanipulated donor CD4+ cells (M/spleen; 12.4\u00b10.7 [no Treg] vs. 20.7\u00b10.8 [+Treg], p=<0.0001) and CD8+ cells (M/spleen; 8.4\u00b10.8 [no Treg] vs. 16.1\u00b11.4 [+Treg], p= 0.0014). Treg cell co-infusion also inhibited Th2.rapa cell-mediated cytokine polarization (d 19 post-BMT, pg/ml; IL-4 reduced from 497\u00b147 [no Treg] to 100\u00b115 [+ Treg]; p=<0.0001); IL-10 reduced from 160\u00b132 [no Treg] to 27\u00b17 [+Treg]; p= 0.004; and IFN-\u03b3 increased from 83\u00b15 [no Treg] to 230\u00b140 [+Treg]; p=0.006). Finally, for Th2.rapa cell recipients, co-infusion of Treg cells reduced post-BMT survival (median d post-BMT; 44.2\u00b11.1 [no Treg] vs. 30.7\u00b11.3 [+Treg]; p=0.0002). In conclusion, interventions that promote Treg cell responses, namely infusion of IL-2 and co-administration of natural Treg cells, reduce Th2.rapa cell promotion of IL-4 and IL-10 post-BMT and reduce the Th2 cell-mediated survival advantage against established GVHD. Because IL-4 and IL-10 are required for Th2.rapa cell therapy of GVHD in this model, these new data indicate that Treg cells abrogate Th2.rapa cell therapy by inhibiting the Th2 cell effector response.",
