    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2124 Background: Without effective iron chelation therapy (ICT), patients with transfusional iron overload are at risk of excess iron-related cardiac complications. Cardiac iron accumulation can be measured using T2* magnetic resonance (normal >20 ms, high risk <10 ms). There are few randomized controlled trials assessing ICT for cardiac iron removal. CORDELIA is a Phase II, multinational, randomized comparison of efficacy and safety of 1-yr treatment with deferasirox or deferoxamine (DFO). Primary objective was non-inferiority of deferasirox vs DFO for cardiac iron removal after 1 yr. Methods: Patients with \u03b2-thalassemia major, cardiac T2* 6\u201320 ms, no clinical symptoms of cardiac dysfunction, aged \u226510 yrs, history of \u226550 transfusions, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u226556% and liver iron concentration (LIC) \u22653 mg Fe/g dry weight (dw) were recruited. Patients were randomized to an intensified DFO regimen with a target dose of 50\u201360 mg/kg/d sc for 8\u201312 hrs, 5\u20137 d/wk, or deferasirox with a target daily oral dose of 40 mg/kg/d. Dose adjustment recommendations were based on continuous assessment of efficacy and safety markers. Efficacy was assessed in the per-protocol analysis population. Primary efficacy endpoint was change after 1-yr treatment (using last available value \u2265150 d after randomization) in cardiac T2* expressed as the ratio of geometric means (Gmean) at end of study (EOS) over baseline (BL) for deferasirox divided by the ratio of Gmeans for DFO. Non-inferiority was pre-defined if the lower limit of the 2-sided repeated 95% confidence interval (CI) for ratio of Gmeans was >0.9. Results: From 925 screened patients, 197 patients (mean age 19.8 \u00b1 6.4 yrs) were randomized. Mean time since start of transfusions was 19.3 and 18.4 yrs in deferasirox and DFO patients, respectively. All patients had received previous ICT. At BL, Gmean cardiac T2* was 11.4 ms; mean \u00b1 SD LIC was 29.8 \u00b1 17.5 mg Fe/g dw in deferasirox patients and 30.3 \u00b1 17.9 mg Fe/g dw in DFO patients; median (range) serum ferritin level was 5062 (613\u201315331) and 4684 (677\u201313342) ng/mL, respectively. 160 (81.2%) patients completed 1 yr. Mean actual dose of deferasirox was 36.7 \u00b1 4.2 mg/kg/d and DFO was 41.5 \u00b1 8.7 mg/kg/d for 7 d/wk. Overall, Gmean cardiac T2* increased by 12% with deferasirox and 7% with DFO after 1 yr (Fig A). The Gmean ratio between the two arms was 1.0557 (95% CI 0.9981, 1.1331). Lower limit of the 95% CI was >0.9, demonstrating non-inferiority of deferasirox vs DFO, with a trend towards superiority ( P =0.0567). Trends toward increases were observed in patients with severe or mild/moderate cardiac iron (Fig B, C). In patients with BL LIC <7 mg Fe/g dw, increase in cardiac T2* was 30% for deferasirox (n=11) and 10% for DFO (n=8), for BL LIC 7\u2013<15 mg Fe/g dw increase was 19% (n=14) for deferasirox and 13% (n=14) for DFO, and in patients with BL LIC \u226515 mg Fe/g dw increase was 9% (n=66) and 5% (n=59), respectively. LVEF was stable with deferasirox (BL 66.9 \u00b1 5.61%; EOS 66.3 \u00b1 5.8%) and DFO (BL 66.4 \u00b1 5.2%; EOS 66.4 \u00b1 5.8%). LIC absolute change from BL was \u20138.9 \u00b1 11.4 (95% CI \u201311.5, \u20136.4) mg Fe/g dw for deferasirox and \u201312.7 \u00b1 11.4 (\u201315.3, \u201310.1) mg Fe/g dw for DFO. Overall adverse event (AE) rates were 67.7% in deferasirox patients and 75.8% in DFO patients. In deferasirox patients, most common AEs were diarrhea (12.5%), proteinuria (11.5%) and influenza (10.4%). Most common AEs in DFO patients were proteinuria (8.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (8.8%) and influenza (6.6%). Serious AEs occurred in 10.7% patients overall (10.4% deferasirox; 11.0% DFO), with many related to the underlying disease. 3 deferasirox patients and 1 DFO patient had 2 consecutive serum creatinine increases >33% above BL and >upper limit of normal (ULN). Overall, 14.6% of deferasirox patients and 3.3% of DFO patients had ALT levels >5xULN and >2xBL. One death (arrhythmia) in the deferasirox arm was considered unrelated to study drug. One death (meningitis) in a DFO patient was suspected to be related to DFO. Discussion: CORDELIA, the first randomized controlled trial comparing deferasirox with DFO for cardiac iron removal, met its primary endpoint in demonstrating non-inferiority of deferasirox vs DFO, with a trend for superiority. There was a trend toward more pronounced improvements in cardiac T2* with deferasirox vs DFO in patients with BL LIC <15 mg Fe/g dw. The frequency of AEs was similar between treatment groups and the deferasirox safety profile was comparable to previous reports.
