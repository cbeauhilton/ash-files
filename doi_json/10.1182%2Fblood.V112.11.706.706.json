    "abstract_text": "The OTT1 gene is fused with the MAL gene in t(1;22) infant-associated acute megakaryocytic leukemia generating a chimeric protein, OTT1-MAL. OTT1 is a transcriptional activator/repressor related to the spen/SHARP/Mint family. Mint was shown to regulate follicular versus marginal zone B-cell development in the spleen; however, Ott1\u2019s physiologic role in B cell development is not fully understood. Recent data utilizing conditional deletion of a targeted Ott1 allele in mice delineated multiple regulatory roles for Ott1 in myeloid and lymphoid differentiation. Previous work by our laboratory showed that loss of Ott1 in addition to causing a myeloid and megakaryocytic expansion, results in a block in B development prior to the B220+CD43-IgM+ stage. We have characterized Ott1-deficient B-cell progenitors to identify stage- and process-specific requirements for Ott1 in pre B development. Ott1-deleted bone marrow and fetal liver could not generate pre B colonies in methylcellulose, however, we were able to establish IL-7-dependent pro B cell lines in vitro and observed no significant differences in proliferation, apoptosis or the ability to form v-Abl-transformed cell lines. Activated Ras or overexpression of Bcl2 failed to rescue pre B colony formation. In vivo, Ott1 null fetal liver pre B-cells expressed Ig heavy chain but failed to express the B-cell receptor (BCR) on their surface even though kappa rearrangement was detectable in vitro. In comparison to wildtype cells, B220+CD43-IgH+ Ott1 null cells were larger in size, had lower levels of IL-7R, but proliferated at higher levels and with an associated increase in apoptosis. Moreover, these cells had normal pre-BCR proximal signaling as judged by phospho-Blnk and phospho-Erk, but increased phosphorylation of S6 after IL7 and Ig stimulation. Ott1 null large pre B-cells had normal expression of Myc, but higher levels of expression of Cyclin D1. Taken together, these data indicate that loss of Ott1 results in enhanced proliferation and apoptosis in the pre B-cell compartment causing a developmental block at the large to small pre B-cell transition. Differentiation blocks at the pro and pre B stage through mutations in B cell regulatory genes, such as PAX5, BTK and BLNK, have been recently demonstrated in acute lymphocytic leukemias. It is plausible that mutations in OTT1, given its position in the tightly regulated process of B cell development, may likewise contribute to pre B-leukemogenesis.",
