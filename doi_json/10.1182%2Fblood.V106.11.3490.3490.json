    "abstract_text": "Background: Most newly diagnosed patients with MM have detectable M-protein in serum or urine; only ~5% have non-secretory MM and another 5% are \u201clow secretors\u201d with serum M < 0.5 g/dL and < 100mg/d of Bence Jones proteinuria despite marked tumor burden detected in the bone marrow and on imaging studies. Serum FLCs are present in the majority of such patients and are useful for response assessment. The aim of this study was to examine sFLC in the context of a comprehensive staging work-up for MM. Patients and Methods: TT2 protocol consists of intensive induction with VAD, DCEP, CAD and DCEP followed by tandem transplants, while in TT3 Velcade (V) is added to the DT-PACE regimen in 2 cycles as induction prior to MEL 200 tandem transplant and 2 cycles as consolidation, followed by VDT maintenance. 328 patients from these 2 protocols had baseline sFLC along with the other standard variables. The association between baseline sFLC levels and sFCL ratio (FLCr) and standard parameters was evaluated using Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient and a Kruskal-Wallis test. During the induction therapy, bi-weekly samples were available for TT3 patients while TT2 patients had weekly samples procured. Results: Significant positive baseline correlations between sFLC and B2M, LDH, creatinine, bone marrow PC% and urine-M excretion (all p=30 mg/dL and serial sFLC measurements were considered: 19% and 23% had normalization of sFLC by 30 days of induction therapy and prior to transplant 1. Normalization of sFLC increased probability of subsequent CR both at 30 days (HR: 3.1; p=0.002) and prior to TX1 (HR=3.9; p=\u2212.001) (Figure 1). Conclusion: S-FLC and FCLr are both highly correlated with CA and ISS, the 2 most important prognostic factors for both EFS and OS, and can hence be expected to have major independent predictive power with longer follow-up. Importantly, subsequent CR was significantly lower in the absence of sFLC normalization by 30 days and prior to transplant 1. Fig 1.
