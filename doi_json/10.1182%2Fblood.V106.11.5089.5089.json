    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Justification and Objectives There are little epidemiologic data about Myeloma Multiple in Spain. The heterogeneity and complexity of this pathology, and the several sociodemographic factors, justify the interest of this type of studies. On the other hand, this disease needs a high assignement of welfare and therapeutic resources, and besides new strategies have arisen for its treatment. The Spanish Leukaemia and Lymphoma Foundation (FLL)has analyzed the actual situation of Myeloma Multiple in Spain, compiling several epidemiologic and welfare parameters about the disease in a Multiple Myeloma \u201cWhite Book\u201d for Spain. Patients and Methods The period of analysis was 10 years, from 1.991 to 2.001. The information was compiled from a Hospital Based Survey about MM and the following official sources: International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC): \u201cCancer incidence in Five continents\u201d and \u201cIncidence and Mortaliity for Cancer In Spain, Patterns and Tendences\u201d Data Base of EUCAN and GLOBOCAN (Cancer Incidence, Mortality and Prevalence Worldwide) EUROCARE III study, (IARC Cancer Base Number 5, Lyon, IARCPress). \u201cNatural Changes of Population and Demography. Spanish National Statistic Institute (INE) and National Spanish Center for Epidemiology (CNE.) Official Records for Mortality Rates by MM in Spain in Spanish Regions (CCAA) (death records Demograhy Records of INE). INE Hospital Case Rate Inquest. CMBD Data Base of Department of Health (Inmunoproliferative Neoplasm and Multiple Myeloma, CIE-9 Diagnosis Code: 203.0)The indicators used were: Deaths number, median of age, proportional mortality, mortality rates, mortality rates adjusted by age, gender and potential years of life lost due to multiple myeloma, (item 203 of ICD-10, OMS) during the last ten years in Spain. Results The incidence rates of MM, adjusted to the European population were: 3,54 cases by 100.000/year for men and 2,54 cases by 100.000/year for women. The global incidence rate were 4,44 cases by 100.000/year for men and 4,22 cases by 100.000/year for women. These rates were similar in all geographic regions. Performed predictions show a prevalence increase during the following five years, which means more than 2.400 cases in men and more than 2.100 in women MM cases per year. Regarding mortality, rates, myeloma is a very slightly frequent cause of death: 3.23 cases by 100.000/years of men and 2.3 cases of women. A whole an increase of mortality of 45.2 per cent was observed for the period of time between 1992 and 2001. Comments and Conclusions The MM incidence and mortality rates in Spain for this period were lower than expected in comparison with other European epidemiology studies. Nevertheless we observed that the MM mortality and prevalence rates present a continuous and uniform increment in the last years. Part of these increases can be due to the incorporation of new technologies, more sensitive for diagnosis, and to the increase of aging of the population. Furthermore certain occupational and chemical exposures and other environmental changes could explain these trends."
