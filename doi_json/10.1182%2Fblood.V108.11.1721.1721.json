    "abstract_text": "The anti-tumor effect of adoptively transferred tumor-specific CTLs is impaired by the limited capacity of these cells to expand within the tumor microenvironment. Administration of IL2 has been used to overcome this limitation, but the systemic toxicity and the potential expansion of unwanted cells including regulatory T cells limit the clinical value of this strategy. To discover whether transgenic expression of lymphokines by the CTLs themselves might overcome these limitations, we compared the effects of transgenic expression of IL2 and IL15 in our model of tumor antigen-Epstein Barr Virus-specific CTLs (EBV-CTLs). Bicistronic retroviral vectors were generated encoding hIL2 or hIL15 and a truncated form of the human CD34 molecule (DCD34) as a marker to track transgenic cells. The two genes were linked using a 2A peptide cleavable sequence. Based on the expression of CD34, the transduction rate was 29\u00b16%, 26\u00b112% and 34\u00b119% respectively for CTLs/IL2v, CTLs/IL15v and CTLs/DCD34 alone. Twenty eight days after stimulation with the antigen (LCLs) at E:T ratio 1:1, we observed significant expansion of CTLs/IL2v (2283 fold expansion, range 410\u20135131) and CTLs/IL15v (1194, range 41\u20133420) compared to CTLs/DCD34 without cytokines (90% CD3+/CD8+) and remained polyclonal as assessed by staining for the TCRVb repertoire. Antigenic specificity was maintained since CTLs/IL2v and CTLs/IL15v killed autologous LCLs (40\u00b110% at E:T ratio 20:1) but not allogeneic LCLs or K562 cells (0.8\u20131 cm, while 5/7 mice receiving CTLs/IL15v or CTLs/IL2v had undetectable tumor. In conclusion, our data indicate that transgenic expression of either IL2 or IL15 improves the expansion and anti-tumor effect of EBV-CTLs in vivo. However, IL15 preferentially expands transduced CTLs, and may avoid an increase of unwanted cells in the tumor microenvironment.",
