    "abstract_text": "DNA methylation at cytosine position 5 (5mC) is a genetic modification that regulates gene expression and is critical for cancer initiation and development. The methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2 participates in active DNA demethylation by converting 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and its subsequent intermediates thereby regulating gene expression. TET2 gene is frequently mutated in hematological disorders, including 15-25% of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases. Loss of TET2 function leads to DNA hypermethylation and subsequent dysregulated gene expression in hematopoietic stem cells, and has been considered as an initial step of myeloid malignant transformation including MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). While enzymatic activity of TET2 is well studied, little is known about post-translational modifications (PTMs) that regulate its activity in hematopoietic cells. Lysine acetylation, one of the most crucial PTMs, occurs in a variety of proteins and modulates protein-protein or protein-nucleic acids interactions. Here, we first observed that ectopic expression of histone acetyltransferase EP300 or CREB binding protein (CBP) increased the endogenous TET2 acetylation in 293T cells. Mass spectrometry analysis of TET2 identified several conserved acetylated lysine residues located on the exterior surface of its catalytic domain (CD), which is predicted to be essential for the interaction of TET2 with DNA. Modeling of TET2/DNA interaction using x-ray crystal structure (PDB code: 4NM6) indicates acetylated TET2 interferes with DNA binding thereby impairing the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Like other acetylated proteins, TET2 modification is reversible, since ectopic expression of the protein deacetylase Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) significantly decreases acetylation of TET2. A domain mapping analysis revealed that SIRT1 preferentially interacts with TET2 CD, further supporting the regulatory role of SIRT1 on TET2. To explore the role of SIRT1 mediated deacetylaion of TET2 in more physiological condition, SIRT1 knockdown (KD) MDS-L cells as well as SIRT1 knockout (KO) murine hematopoietic c-kit + cells were used. In MDS-L cells derived from a MDS patient, SIRT1 KD promoted hyperacetylation of endogenous TET2 which is associated with 50% decrease in 5hmC levels compared to control (p=0.03, n=3). Similarly, SIRT1 KO murine c-Kit + cells showed TET2 hyperacetylation and 62% decrease in 5hmC compared to wildtype (WT) counterpart (p=0.009, n=5). Phenotypically, the transforming ability of SIRT1 shRNA transduced MDS-L cells was evaluated in vitro through serial replating assay. In contrast to first plating which showed no difference between two groups, the number of colonies derived from SIRT1 KD cells was 2.39 fold higher than that from the control shRNA transduced group after two rounds of replating (p=0.0002, n=3). Importantly, we tested the in-vivo effect of SIRT1 KD on MDS-L cells engrafted in immunodeficient NSGS mice. SIRT1 KD significantly enhanced MDS-L cell engraftment compared to control shRNA (50\u00b15% of human CD45 + cells in SIRT1 KD group vs. 19\u00b14% human CD45 + cells in control group, p=0.003, n=6). Interestingly, increased transformation capacity of SIRT1 KD MDS-L cells was associated with decreased expression of TET2 regulated tumor suppressor genes. For example, expression levels of Mtss1 and Dusp6 were significantly decreased in SIRT1 KD MDS-L cells compared to control shRNA counterpart (Mtss1, 49\u00b15% decrease compared to control, p=0.005; Dusp6, 25\u00b12% decrease compared to control, p=0.01). Similar results were observed in SIRT1 KO cells. The validation of physical binding of TET2 to its targets is ongoing. Moreover, the effect of an SIRT1 allosteric activator-SRT1720 in MDS-L cells is similar to that of Vitamin C, a known TET2 activator. Specifically, SRT1720 significantly increased Mtss1 expression in MDSL cells (p=0.0005, n=3), indicating that SIRT1 agonist may lead to activation of TET2 downstream tumor suppressor genes. In summary, our data demonstrate that TET2 activity can be functionally modified by acetylation and may be enhanced in MDS patients that do not harbor loss-of-function mutations through the SIRT1 mediated deacetylation. These results support further exploration of molecular mechanisms inducing TET2 acetylation, and evaluation of SIRT1 activation as a potential therapeutic approach in MDS.
