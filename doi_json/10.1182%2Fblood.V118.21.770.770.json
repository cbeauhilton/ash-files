    "abstract_text": "Abstract 770 Background: Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) is a B-cell lymphoma characterized by high serum monoclonal IgM and infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells into the bone marrow. As with many hematologic malignancies, cytokines within the tumor microenvironment play an important role in supporting the growth and survival of malignant WM cells. IL-21 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells. During malignancy, IL-21 has demonstrated diverse effects promoting the growth of myeloma and Hodgkin lymphoma cells while inducing apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, the biologic significance of IL-21 has not been examined in WM. Our objective here was to assess the expression of IL-21 and its receptor in WM cells and to examine whether IL-21 contributes to the biology of WM. Results: When compared to normal bone marrows, immunohistochemistry revealed significant IL-21 staining in the bone marrow of patients with WM (n=5). To determine whether WM cells are susceptible to IL-21 in the microenvironment, expression of the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) was assessed via PCR in CD19 + CD138 + cells isolated by positive selection from patients with WM (n=8) and in the newly characterized WM cell line, MWCL-1. Nearly all (7/8) CD19 + CD138 + WM cells expressed IL-21R, as did MWCL-1 cells. Using flow cytometry we detected expression of IL-21R protein on the surface of WM cells as well. The contribution of microenvironmental IL-21 to the biology of WM tumors was then examined. In MWCL-1 cells, IL-21 (100 ng/mL) increased proliferation by 37% (p=0.005) over untreated controls as determined by thymidine incorporation at 72 hr, and in primary WM cells, proliferation increased by nearly 50% (p=0.003). Interestingly, the immortalized B cell line, IM-9, responded to IL-21 with a significant decrease in proliferation, consistent with previous data indicating differential effects of IL-21 depending on the pathological status of the B-cell in question. IL-21 also significantly induced (p<0.0005) IgM secretion in WM as measured by ELISA (MWCL-1 5,956 +/\u2212 393 ng/mL vs. 10,013 +/\u2212 730 ng/mL; CD19 + 138 + WM 504 +/\u2212 33 ng/mL vs. 811 +/\u2212 32.5 ng/mL). Annexin/PI staining was used to assess viability, but no apoptotic effects were associated with IL-21 in WM. To better understand the mechanisms through which IL-21 increases cellular proliferation and IgM secretion in WM, we characterized STAT activation in response to this cytokine. In MWCL-1 cells, IL-21 significantly increased the phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT3, and to a lesser extent, STAT5. Treatment with a STAT3 inhibitor completely abolished the effects of IL-21 on cellular proliferation and IgM secretion suggesting IL-21 mediates its biologic activity through a STAT3-dependent mechanism. The expression of transcription factors involved in B-cell differentiation was also measured in MWCL-1 cells treated with IL-21. Both BLIMP-1 and Bcl-6 levels significantly increased upon addition of IL-21, whereas PAX5 was significantly decreased. IL-21 had no effect on the expression of XBP-1, which is involved in regulating Ig secretion, suggesting that the increase in IgM secretion in MWCL-1 cells may occur secondary to the increase in proliferation, as opposed to an actual increase in the production of IgM. Lastly, IL-21 significantly enhanced IL-10 secretion from MWCL-1 cells (669 +/\u2212 152 pg/mL vs. 1,948 +/\u2212 279 pg/mL, p=0.0002). While the interplay between IL-10 and IL-21 in WM remains to be examined, IL-10 is known to be involved in normal B-cell development and may have synergistic effects with IL-21 in malignant WM cells. Overall our data indicate that IL-21 in the bone marrow microenvironment significantly affects the biology of WM tumor cells through a STAT3-dependent mechanism.
