    "abstract_text": "The Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium (MMRC) Genomics Initiative was instigated to harness the power of multiple genomic approaches to further the understanding of multiple myeloma. To date, 137 samples from patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed myeloma (out of an estimated final total of 250 by the end of the year) have been subjected to expression profiling and array comparative genomic hybridization. To identify regions of recurrent copy number alteration with a high degree of confidence, we have used the Genomic Identification of Significant Targets In Cancer (GISTIC) algorithm, which detects such regions and assigns a probability to each. Application of GISTIC to the MMRC collection identified 14 significant regions of amplification and 15 significant regions of deletion. The algorithm further detects peaks of copy number change that contribute to each region\u2019s significance. Of genes that were expressed in our dataset, a total of 64 across the genome were found to lie within the boundaries of significant amplification peaks and 30 were found to lie within significant deletion peaks. Given the likelihood that this gene collection is highly enriched for genes important in the pathogenesis of myeloma and potential therapeutic targets, it has been prioritized for further validation with the amplified genes submitted for arrayed RNAi and the deleted genes expedited for re-sequencing. In order to define a poor prognosis group, we developed and applied a model based on the gene expression dataset of Shaughnessy and colleagues. To identify pathways activated in poor prognosis disease, we applied Gene Set Enrichment Analysis with the Molecular Signatures Database. This demonstrated enrichment of multiple canonical pathways within the poor prognosis group, including those associated with proliferation, cell cycle progression and DNA repair. A search for recurrent copy number events associated with poor prognosis disease revealed that by far the most significant event, and the only one surviving correction for multiple hypothesis testing, was mono- or bi-allelic deletion of CDKN2C (p18). Interestingly, the poor prognosis group also demonstrated higher expression of p18 in those samples without bi-allelic deletion and of CDKN2A (p16). Deletion and increased expression of p18 in high proliferation index myeloma samples has previously been described. However, our analyses demonstrate the pre-eminence of p18 loss for defining poor prognosis disease compared to other recurrent copy number changes. Furthermore, it expands on work in other tumors demonstrating feedback mechanisms between cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor pathways, suggesting a more complex model of interplay between the pathways than previously described. In conclusion, the MMRC reference collection is proving an important tool in the fight to understand key genetic events in multiple myeloma and would ultimately be anticipated to contribute towards development of improved therapy for the disease.",
