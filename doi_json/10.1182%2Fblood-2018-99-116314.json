    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Black Americans have been reported to have a higher incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared to white Americans. The underlying cause of this disparity is not well characterized. Protein S, protein C, and antithrombin deficiency are known risk factors for VTE. There is inconsistent data regarding racial variation on the effect of protein S, protein C, and antithrombin levels and/or deficiency and risk of VTE. Most prior studies have not included a large black study population. The aim of this investigation is to compare levels of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin between VTE cases and controls by race among enrollees in the Genetic Attributes and Thrombosis Epidemiology (GATE) study, accounting for genetic differences such as hemoglobin genotype that may contribute to differences in protein levels by race. Methods: Testing for protein S, protein C, and antithrombin deficiency was performed on a subset of participants enrolled in the GATE study, a case-control study comprised of VTE cases and controls frequency-matched on age, sex, and race (self-identified). Controls had no history of VTE and did not receive anticoagulant therapy. Antigen and activity levels in cases were measured at least one month after completion of anticoagulation therapy. A priori cutoff levels for determining deficiency status were standardized per Centers for Disease Control Hemostasis Laboratory reference ranges. Beta hemoglobin genotype was determined by either a multiplex genotyping assay or sequencing of the beta hemoglobin gene. Differences in protein levels between cases and controls were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between protein S, protein C, or antithrombin deficiency and VTE. Crude models were conditioned on the matching factors, and adjusted models were conditioned on the matching factors and controlled for patient characteristics found to be associated with VTE and protein S, protein C, or antithrombin deficiency. Potential effect modification was assessed using likelihood ratio tests. Results: Among 2,454 subjects enrolled in the GATE study, 1,436 subjects (63.6%) had samples available for analysis. Protein S activity and total protein S antigen levels were significantly lower among VTE cases compared to controls in both white and black participants; however, antithrombin levels were higher among VTE cases compared to controls in white participants only. (Table 1) The prevalence of protein S and protein C deficiency was higher among VTE cases compared to controls in both white and black participants in the GATE study (Table 2). The prevalence of antithrombin deficiency was similar between VTE cases compared to controls. Adjusting for the effect of family history of VTE, history of cancer, and hemoglobin genotype, the effect of protein S and protein C deficiency on odds of VTE was stronger among black participants compared to white participants (Table 2). Conclusions: The effects of protein S and protein C deficiency on the odds of being a VTE case were higher among black participants in the GATE study, controlling for confounding variables including hemoglobin genotype. While these results indicate protein S and protein C deficiency may be important contributors to disparities in VTE occurrence, additional investigations using a larger study populations and different study designs are warranted.
