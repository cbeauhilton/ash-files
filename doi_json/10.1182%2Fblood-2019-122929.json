    "abstract_text": "Background : Advances in the understanding of the genetic determinants of AML and the widespread use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) have led to the refinement of prognostically distinct molecular subgroups. Mutations in ASXL1 and SRSF2 , which are common in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), rarely co-occur in patients (pts) with AML. The largest reported cohort (n=15) of ASXL1 / SRSF2 co-mutated AML had no long-term survivors (Papaemmanuil et al. NEJM 2016). It remains unknown how clinical factors such as prior history of a myeloid neoplasm or intensity of treatment influence outcomes. We sought to assess the clinical characteristics and analyze outcomes in a larger cohort of pts with ASXL1 / SRSF2 co-mutated AML. We hypothesized that this profile may be a genomic footprint of prior myeloid neoplasia. Methods : We conducted a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of newly diagnosed adult AML pts with both ASXL1 and SRSF2 mutations at the University of North Carolina and at Moffitt Cancer Center from 2011-2018. NGS was performed on DNA using the Illumina TruSight Myeloid 54-gene sequencing panel. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) defined as time from diagnosis of AML to death. Pts were stratified by secondary AML (s-AML), defined as having a documented history of MDS/MPN. Secondary outcomes included rates of complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi). Multivariable analysis was performed with baseline characteristics. Results : Forty-six pts were identified and included. The median age of pts was 72 years (range 42 - 85). Sixty-seven percent (28/42) had normal cytogenetics; 88% (37/42) were intermediate risk cytogenetics by current ELN guidelines. Sixty-one percent (n=28) were classified as having s-AML. One pt had therapy-related AML without preexisting MDS/MPN and was therefore not included in s-AML. The Figure illustrates co-existing mutations and individual responses to upfront therapy stratified by s-AML and non-s-AML. The median number of mutations was 5 (range 2 - 7). The most common co-occurring mutations were TET2 (52%), RUNX1 (35%), IDH2 (15%), and STAG2 (15%). Median OS was 7.0 months (m) (CI 5.3, 15.4). Median OS for pts with s-AML (n=28) and non-s-AML (n=18) was 6.1 and 15.4 m (p=0.05), respectively. There was no significant difference in median OS between s-AML and non-s-AML on multivariable analysis (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.56, p=0.07). Median OS did not differ by age (Age <65 years v. older, p=0.54), total # of mutations (\u2265 5 v. less, p=0.73), or etiology of s-AML (MDS v. MPN, p=0.66). Twenty-two (47%) pts received upfront intensive induction chemotherapy (IC), 17 (37%) received hypomethylating agents (HMAs), and 7 pts (15%) received no AML-directed chemotherapy. Median OS did not significantly differ between pts receiving upfront IC and HMAs (15.3 v. 7.04 m, p=0.21). Among non-s-AML pts, median OS was longer in those receiving IC (n=10) versus HMAs (n=7) (15.4 v. 3.5 m, p=0.01). Among all pts receiving IC, median OS was longer in non-s-AML pts (n=10) versus s-AML pts (n=12) (15.4 v. 5.9 m, p=0.01). Median OS did not differ by treatment intensity for s-AML pts (IC v. HMA: 5.9 v. 9.9 m, p=0.38). Six pts underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) with a median OS NR (median follow-up 15.6 m). Overall rate of CR/CRi was 35% and was similar between pts receiving IC and HMAs (45% v. 21%, p=0.29). Among pts with non-s-AML, CR/CRi rates with IC and HMAs were 70% and 29%, respectively (p=0.11). Among pts with s-AML, CR/CRi rates with IC and HMAs were 42% and 20%, respectively (p=0.38). On multivariable analysis of baseline characteristics, only ECOG performance status (PS) was significantly associated with OS (HR 2.25, p=0.01). ECOG PS remained significant (HR 2.65, p=0.03) after adjusting for HCT and treatment intensity. Conclusions : ASXL1 / SRSF2 co-mutated AML represents a rare but distinct genotype with most pts having pre-existing myeloid neoplasms and associated co-mutations commonly seen in MDS/MPNs. OS is dismal regardless of age, number of mutations, treatment intensity, or prior history of myeloid neoplasm. HCT may mitigate these poor outcomes and lead to long-term survival. This represents the largest reported cohort to date of pts with ASXL1 / SRSF2 co-mutated AML. Further study is warranted to inform risk stratification and prognosis of pts with ASXL1 / SRSF2 -mutated AML.
