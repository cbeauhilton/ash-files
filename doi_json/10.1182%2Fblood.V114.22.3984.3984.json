Objectives We conducted a randomized, allocation concealed, controlled, assessor-blinded multicenter pilot trial to provide preliminary data on the effectiveness of a 6-month exercise training program in improving the PTS. Methods Patients aged 18-75 years with unilateral DVT diagnosed >6 months previously and ipsilateral PTS (Villalta criteria) were screened for participation in the trial at 2 centres in Canada (Montreal & Ottawa). Eligible, consenting patients were randomized to Active Training (AT) , a 26-week trainer-supervised program consisting of leg strengthening, leg stretching and aerobic exercise, or Attention Control (AC) , a 1-hour presentation on PTS + monthly phone follow-ups. Participants had study visits at Baseline (T0), 3 mths (T3) and 6 mths (T6) to measure generic (SF-36) and venous disease-specific (VEINES-QOL) quality of life (QOL), PTS severity (Villalta scale), leg strength (number of heel lifts) and leg flexibility (stretch angle, in degrees, for quadriceps, hamstring, gastrocnemius and soleus muscles). Within-subject changes from T0 to T6 were compared in AT vs. AC using repeated measures two-way ANOVA. Results From 2007-2008, 43 patients were recruited (21 randomized to AT, 22 to AC). Mean age was 47 years, 44% were male, and 49% had moderate or severe PTS. At 3 and 6 mths, PTS severity category improved in 65% of AT vs. 26% of AC (p=0.02) and 61% of AT vs. 46% of AC (p=ns), respectively. Other results are shown in Table (for all outcomes except Villalta score, + change signifies improvement from T0 to T6).  Outcome measure . Active Training Within subject change, T6-T0, Mean (SD) .

Exercise training appears to be a promising modality to treat PTS, and a large, adequately powered trial is warranted.
