    "abstract_text": "Imatinib mesylate (STI571), a specific Bcr-Abl inhibitor, has shown a potent antileukemic activity in clinical studies of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Early prediction of response to imatinib cannot be anticipated. We used a standardized quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) for bcr-abl transcripts on 191 out of 200 late-chronic phase CML patients enrolled in a phase II clinical trial with imatinib 400 mg/day. Bone marrow samples were collected before treatment, after 3, 6 and 12 months or at the end of study treatment (12 months) while peripheral blood samples were obtained after 2, 3, 6, 10, 14, 20 and 52 weeks of therapy. The amount of Bcr-Abl transcript was expressed as the ratio of Bcr-Abl to \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22M). We show that, following initiation of imatinib, the early Bcr-Abl level trends in both bone marrow and peripheral blood samples made it possible to predict the subsequent cytogenetic outcome after 6 and 12 months of treatment, and that these early trends were also predictive of progression-free survival.",
