    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3463 ERdj4 is a critical component of the unfolded protein response (UPR) that facilitates the removal of unfolded/misfolded substrates from the ER lumen for proteasomal degradation. Since previous studies have linked the UPR to B lymphopoiesis [Reimold, A.M. et al. , Nature, 2001; Zhang, K. et al. , JCI, 2005], we hypothesized that a deficiency in ERdj4 would impact B cell development. The ERdj4 allele was disrupted by a gene trap leading to hypomorphic expression of ERdj4 in mice homozygous for the gene trap allele (ERdj4 GT/GT ). Pro-B, pre-B, immature, and mature B cell populations were significantly reduced in the bone marrow of ERdj4 GT/GT mice, which was associated with an increase in pro-B cell death. ERdj4 GT/GT donor cells transplanted into ERdj4 +/+ recipients rescued all stages of B cell development, implicating a defect in the bone marrow microenvironment. Osteoblasts support B cell development through VCAM-1, SDF-1 and IL-7 signaling [Visnjic, D. et al. , Blood, 2004; Zhu, J. et al. , Blood, 2007]; coincidently, the UPR is essential for osteoblast differentiation [Tohmonda, T. et al. , EMBO, 2011; Wei, J. et al. , J Cell Physiol, 2008]. ERdj4 deficiency in primary bone cells was associated with increased ER stress. Osteoblast-specific markers and the B cell growth factor SDF-1 was also significantly reduced in primary ERdj4 GT/GT bone cells. Importantly, osteoblasts were reduced in femur tissue sections of ERdj4 GT/GT mice. Collectively, these data suggest that the loss of ERdj4 in osteoblasts is associated with a defect in B lymphopoiesis. This research was supported by the NHLBI (HL103923 and HL086492).
