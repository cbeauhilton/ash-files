    "abstract_text": "Objective To explore the quantity and function of macrophages in the patients with BMMNC-Coombs Test(+)hematocytopenia. Methods Sixty-one patients with BMMNCcoombs test IgG(+)hemocytopenia were enrolled in this study. The ratio of macrophages (CD68+/BMMNC), the activation status(CD68+CD69+/CD68+) were detected with Facs. The phagocytic index of macrophage was detected too. Results There was significant difference of the macrophage ratio and phagocytic index between the patients with BMMNC-IgG(+) and those without BMMNC-IgG(P0.05).The level of WBC in the patients with CD15IgG(+) was significant lower than that of patients with CD15IgG(\u2212)(P<0.05).The levels of RBC, Hb and Reticulocyte of patients with GlycoAIgG(+) was significantly lower than those of the patients with GlycoAIgG(\u2212)(P<0.05).There were significant differences of the levels of RBC, Hb and reticulocyte between the patients with BMMNC-IgG and those without BMMNC-IgG(P<0.05).There were also significant differences of the ratio of macrophage, the percentage of activated macrophages and the function of macrophages between the patients with IgG(+)and those without IgG(P<0.05). Conclusion The ratio of macrophage, percentage of activated macrophages and function of macrophages were higher in the patients with BMMNC-Coombs test-IgG(+) hematocytopenia. The pathogenic mechanism of this kind of disease might be associated with the activated macrophages phagocyting and destroying BM hematopoietic cells coated with autologous IgG.",
