    "abstract_text": "Macrophages commonly infiltrate tumor microenvironments and can phagocytose and destroy malignant cells. Cancer cells, however, can inhibit the tumoricidal activity of macrophages by expressing CD47 on their surface. CD47 delivers an anti-phagocytic (\"do not eat\") signal by binding signal-regulatory protein \u03b1 (SIRP\u03b1) on the surface of macrophages. There is strong evidence that many liquid and solid tumors exploit the CD47-SIRP\u03b1 pathway to escape macrophage-mediated destruction. Blockade of this inhibitory axis using a soluble SIRP\u03b1-Fc fusion protein (SIRP\u03b1Fc) has emerged as a promising strategy to neutralize the suppressive effects of CD47 and promote the eradication of tumor cells. Here we have examined the effect of SIRP\u03b1Fc on malignant human B cells in vitro and in vivo . We first assessed the binding of SIRP\u03b1Fc to a panel of established cell lines and primary cells from patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, multiple myeloma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. SIRP\u03b1Fc exhibited strong, dose-dependent binding to all tumor cells, with an average effective half-maximal concentration of approximately 150 nM. Next, the ability of SIRP\u03b1Fc to promote macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of human tumor cells was examined using confocal microscopy. In cultures left untreated or treated with a control Fc fragment, macrophages exhibited a low level of phagocytosis, consistent with CD47-mediated suppression. Blockade of CD47 on the target cells using SIRP\u03b1Fc dramatically increased macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells. The majority of established cell lines and all primary human tumors were sensitized to macrophage-mediated destruction, including both peripheral blood- and bone marrow-derived primary tumor samples. Finally, we assessed the in vivo activity of SIRP\u03b1Fc in CD20 hi (Raji) and CD20 low (Namalwa) B lymphoma xenograft models. SIRP\u03b1Fc treatment significantly reduced Raji growth and increased host mouse survival (time to euthanasia), and completely ablated the growth of Namalwa tumors, the latter being insensitive to rituximab therapy. In conclusion, SIRP\u03b1Fc demonstrated in vitro activity against a broad range of human B cell tumors and was highly effective at controlling the growth of aggressive B lymphoma xenografts in mice, including a CD20 low tumor that was non-responsive to rituximab. These data support the evaluation of SIRP\u03b1Fc in patients with B cell malignancies. Disclosures Nielsen Viller: Trillium Therapeutics Inc.: Employment.
