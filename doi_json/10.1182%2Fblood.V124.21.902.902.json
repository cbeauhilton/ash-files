    "abstract_text": "Daunorubicin (Dnr) has been the choice of anthracycline in the induction chemotherapy of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) along with Cytarabine for the past 4 decades. Drug resistance and relapse of the disease has been the major concern in the success of AML therapy. Several factors, including pharmacokinetics (PK) of Dnr could have impact on treatment outcome as pharmacokinetic effects might limit the amount of drug that reaches the tumor. In this study, we analyzed the factors influencing plasma PK of Daunorubicin and its major metabolite Daunorubicinol (DOL) in AML patients receiving induction chemotherapy and compared PK parameters with clinical outcome (relapse). Sixty four adult denovo AML patients were enrolled in the study after obtaining informed consent. Dnr was given as 1 hour bolus infusion at a dose of 60mg/m2/day for the first 3 days of induction chemotherapy. Peripheral blood were collected at 0, 15min, 1hr, 2hr, 4hr, 6hr and 24hr on the first day of induction chemotherapy. Plasma levels of Dnr and DOL were measured using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detector. Population PK was analyzed by nonlinear mixed effects modeling using Monolix version 4.3.2. Common single nucleotide polymorphisms in ABCB1 , ABCG2 , CBR1 and CBR3 genes were screened by PCR followed by either sequencing or restriction digestion. In vitro cytotoxicity of the primary AML cells to Dnr was assessed by MTT cell viability assay and IC50 was calculated using ADAPT5 software. The role of plasma Dnr PK on relapse of disease was estimated using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. Demographics of the patients enrolled in the study are listed in table 1. PK parameters of Dnr and DOL showed wide inter-individual variation (table2). Older patients had a trend towards lower Dnr clearance (CL) (p=0.09). Patients harboring FLT3-ITD mutations had higher CL than the patients without mutation though not reaching statistical significance. Patients with variants of SNPs rs20572 (exon3) and rs9024 (3\u2019UTR) in CBR1 (which were in complete linkage disequilibrium) had a trend towards significantly higher Dnr AUC [median-0.2711; (0.04903-2.165) vs. median 0.2117; (0.0546-0.9036); p=0.06] than patients with wild-type. Among the 64 patients, complete remission (CR) was documented in 42 (65%) of which, 31% relapsed eventually [median time to relapse 328 (104-864) days]. AML patients who relapsed had significantly lower Dnr AUC [median 0.17 (0.049-2.165) vs. median 0.31 (0.1-1.74); p=0.009] and higher DOL AUC [median 8.67 (1.6-20.1) vs.4.99 (1.3-16.5); p=0.015].Also, relapsed patients had higher Dnr clearance (CL)[median -546.54 (41.5-1632)vs. 329.3 (42.9-944.5); p=0.011] and lower DOL CL[median-9.8 (4.9-56)vs. median- 19.7 (6.1-57); p=0.015]than patients who did not relapse. IC50 of Dnr was higher in patients who relapsed (median-0.7 (0.02-1.46) vs. median- 0.23 (0.007-1.11); p=0.056) than in patients who did not relapse. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first population PK report in AML which is designed to evaluate various factors which might influence Dnr and DOL PK in AML. Though the number is small, our results suggest that plasma PK of Dnr influences clinical outcome in AML. Lower systemic exposure of Dnr in relapsed patients suggests that amount of drug required to completely eradicate the leukemic cells is not achieved and escalating dose might be an option to decrease relapse rates. Cellular pharmacokinetics of Dnr in these patients is ongoing in the lab, which will be more informative and help in prognosticating and dose adjustment for better treatment outcome. This data provides a probable biological basis for the previously reported clinical benefit of decreased relapses following the increase of the dose of DNR in induction to 90mg/m2/day (Tallman et al. NEJM 2009).Wide inter-individual variation in Dnr PK also suggests that this increased dose may not be necessary for all patients. Further studies are required to confirm this finding in a larger cohort of patients and to work towards strategies for TDM of Dnr in AML Figure 1 View large Download slide Figure 1 View large Download slide Close modal Figure 2 View large Download slide Figure 2 View large Download slide Close modal Disclosures Srivastava: Octapharma: Consultancy, Other.",
