    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3840 Poster Board III-776 Hsp90 is an essential chaperone molecule that helps in the maturation and folding of a number of cellular client proteins. Hsp90 function is essential for malignant plasma cell survival, since its inhibition in multiple myeloma (MM) cells results in cell death and activation of apoptosis. Clinical trials using Hsp90 inhibitors are currently ongoing in MM patients. Hsp90 inactivation in MM cells causes perturbation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/unfolded protein response (UPR), eventually triggering the apoptotic cascades. Protein kinase CK2 critically regulates the activity of the chaperone complex formed by the Cdc37 and Hsp90 proteins. We already described that CK2 is over-expressed in a fraction of MM patients and is an essential MM pro-survival molecule. We have here investigated its role in the ER stress/UPR pathways and in Hsp90 inhibition-induced apoptosis in MM cells. Down-regulation of the catalytic CK2 alpha subunit with selective chemical inhibitors or RNA interference resulted in significant modifications of the main UPR regulating signaling cascades: 1) a marked reduction of IRE1alpha protein levels; 2) a reduction of BiP/GRP78 and Hsp70 chaperone protein levels; 3) an increase of PERK activity and phospho eIF2alpha levels. When UPR was triggered by thapsigargin in CK2-inactivated cells, we observed that the IRE1alpha-dependent axis of the UPR was greatly impaired, as XBP-1short isoform generation and the levels of some induced chaperones were reduced. Interestingly, thapsigargin was able to induce CK2 kinase activity. Remarkably, treatment of CK2-silenced MM cells with Hsp90 inhibitors geldanamycin or its derivative 17-AAG (17-(demethoxy)-17-allylamino geldanamycin) resulted in 1) an even more pronounced reduction of IRE1 alpha protein levels; 2) a marked inhibition of GA or 17-AAG-triggered BiP/GRP78 protein level raise; 3) a more evident increase of eIF2 alpha phosphorylation. Of note, CK2 plus Hsp90 inhibition was followed by apoptotic cell death to a much greater extent than that obtained with the single inhibition of the two molecules. Noteworthy, these effects were also reproduced upon modelling the MM bone marrow (BM) microenvironment by co-culturing MM cells with BM stromal cells. These data suggest that CK2-mediated signaling regulates the ER stress/UPR pathways and modulates the threshold to apoptosis of ER stressed MM cells. CK2 interacts with Hsp90, since its inhibition synergizes with GA or 17-AAG treatments in terms of induction of apoptosis and shift of the ER stress/UPR pathways towards the terminal phase. These results might be useful to set the groundwork in designing novel combination treatments for MM patients. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
