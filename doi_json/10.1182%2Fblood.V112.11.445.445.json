    "abstract_text": "Background . Patients with Ph+ CML receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are frequently monitored for response by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) studies for minimal molecular disease. The clinical significance of rising levels of QPCR in CGCR is uncertain. Study Aims . To evaluate the relevance of increases of QPCR levels in patients with CML in CGCR on therapy. Study Group and Methods . Of 258 patients on imatinib therapy for newly diagnosed CML, 116 patients in durable CGCR on imatinib therapy for at least 18 months had significant QPCR increases (documented at least twice) as defined by literature reports. These were analyzed by the achievement of major molecular response (MMR; QPCR < 0.05%), and by the degree of QPCR increase. Results. The outcome of patients by disease status (still in MMR vs. loss of MMR vs. never in MMR) and by the QPCR level increase are shown in the Table. Only 13 of 116 patients (11%) with significant QPCR increases had CML progression; 11 of them were among 44 patients (25%) who either lost a MMR or never had a MMR, and had > 1 log increase of QPCR. The 5-year survival of all 116 patients was 92%, suggesting the minimal relevance of QPCR increases in patients in CGCR. Conclusion . Most patients with significant QPCR increases remain in CGCR. Patients who lose a MMR or never achieve a MMR, and have > 1 log increase of QPCR, should be monitored more closely, and may be evaluated for mutations of BCR-ABL kinase domain and considered for investigational therapeutic interventions. Allogeneic stem cell transplant should not be considered in view of the excellent survival. Outcome of Patients in CGCR by QPCR Increases  Disease Status . QPCR Log increase . No. Patients .
