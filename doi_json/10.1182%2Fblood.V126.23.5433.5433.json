Stem cell mobilization before autologous stem cell transplantation is a source of considerable costs of transplant procedure. Whether modern induction regimens affect outcome of stem cell mobilization has not been extensively studied. Aim: The goal of this study was to compare efficacy of stem cell mobilization after different induction regimens in patients with multiple myeloma. The primary goal was to compare CTD (cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, dexamethasone), CVD (cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, dexamethasone) and VTD (bortezomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone) and regimens in terms of succesful stem cell collection. Methods: All patients with multiple myeloma who have been planned for stem cell collection and were treated with one of the above mentioned regimens were included in this retrospective analysis. The demographic data, amount of stem cells collected, number of days needed to reach the target collection were recorded. All patients received high dose cyclophosphamide 2,5 g/m2 prior to stem cell collection and were primed with G-CSF twice daily from day 5. The collection was started at day 10. Collection goal was 8x10 6 /kg CD34+ cells. Results: 15 patients received CTD, 25 patients CVD and 16 patients VTD regimen before stem cell collection. Groups were comparable according to age, gender and myeloma stages. Mean collected cells at the end of collection were 9.2 (SD 2.8) for CTD, 12.3 (SD 5.6) for CVD and 10.1 (SD 2.1) for VTD (p=0.066). Mean daily harvest was 3.4, 8.0 and 7.6 x10 6 /kg respectively (p=0.01). Mean days needed to reach desired harvest were 3, 2.25 and 1.6 days (p=0.001). No collection failure was observed. Conclusion: The best collection results were seen in patients after induction with CVD or VTD regimen. VTD regimen also required the least days for collection and seems to be most beneficial for cost of collection. CTD regimen shows the least efficacy in stem cell collection before autologous transplantation. All patients managed to harvest for at least one stem cell transplant. Figure 1.
