    "article_date": "November 16, 2008",
    "session_type": "Myeloproliferative Syndromes",
    "abstract_text": "The Src homology-2 (SH2) domain-containing phosphatase 2 (Shp2), encoded by Ptpn11 , is an ubiquitously expressed non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) that positively regulates Ras/Erk activation in many receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RTK) and cytokine receptors. Mutations in PTPN11 are found in ~35% of patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and at lower incidence in other neoplasms. To model JMML pathogenesis, we generated knock-in mice that conditionally express the leukemia-associated mutant Ptpn11 D61Y . Ptpn11 D61Y expression in all hematopoietic cells evokes a fatal myeloproliferative disorder (MPD), featuring leukocytosis, anemia, hepatosplenomegaly with extramedullary hematopoiesis, and factor-independent colony formation by bone marrow (BM) and spleen cells. The Lin \u2212 Sca1 + cKit + (LSK) compartment is expanded and \u201cright-shifted\u201d, accompanied by increased stem cell factor (SCF)-evoked colony formation and Erk and Akt activation. However, stem cell activity is decreased in diseased mice, and mice engrafted with Ptpn11 D16Y stem cells fail to develop MPD. Ptpn11 D16Y common myeloid (CMP) and granulocyte-monocyte (GMP) progenitors produce cytokine-independent colonies in a cell-autonomous manner, and demonstrate elevated Erk and Stat5 activation in response to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-SCF) stimulation. Ptpn11 D61Y megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEP) yield increased numbers of erythrocyte burst-forming units (BFU-E), but MEP and erythrocyte-committed progenitors (EP) produce fewer erythrocyte colonyforming units (CFU-E), indicating defective erythroid differentiation. Our studies provide a mouse model for Ptpn11 -evoked MPD and show that this disease results from cellautonomous, and distinct lineage-specific effects of mutant Ptpn11 on multiple stages of hematopoiesis.",
