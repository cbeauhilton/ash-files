    "abstract_text": "Background: CTCs may be responsible for MM spreading and accordingly, their numbers in peripheral blood (PB) could be a potential surrogate marker for the rate of dissemination and overall tumor burden in bone marrow (BM). In such case, CTCs may be a powerful biomarker of malignant transformation and disease aggressiveness. Aim: To investigate the clinical significance of CTCs in patients with smoldering (SMM), newly diagnosed (NDMM) and relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM), and to compare the transcriptional profile of CTCs across the disease spectrum. Methods: Next-generation flow (NGF) cytometry was used to assess the percentage of CTCs in PB of 1,157 patients: 316 with SMM, 650 with NDMM and 191 with RRMM. In each disease setting, patients were sub-classified into three groups with undetectable, low and high percentage of CTCs. Cutoffs were defined using maximally selected rank statistics adjusted for time to progression (TTP) in SMM and progression free survival (PFS) in NDMM/RRMM. A subset of SMM patients (n=86) was enrolled in GEM-CESAR. Transplant eligible (n=374) and ineligible (n=276) NDMM, as well as RRMM patients, were homogenously treated according to the GEM2012MENOS65, GEM-CLARIDEX and GEM-KYCYDEX clinical trials, respectively. In 40 patients (2 SMM, 33 NDMM and 5 RRMM) paired CTCs and BM tumor cells were FACSorted and their transcriptional profile was analyzed using RNAseq. Differentially expressed genes were investigated using DESeq2 . Results: CTCs were detected in 248/316 (78%), 597/650 (92%) and 170/192 (89%) of SMM, NDMM and RRMM patients. Median CTC frequencies were: 0.001% (0.05 CTCs/\u00b5L), 0.01% (0.64 CTCs/\u00b5L) and 0.005% (0.22 CTCs/\u00b5L), respectively. There were 79 genes differentially expressed between patient-matched CTCs and BM tumor cells (e.g., FLNA , EMP3 , LGALS9 , MUC1 ). These were functionally related with TNF\u03b1 signaling and inflammatory response (enriched in CTCs), as well as to cell cycle and MYC targets (enriched in BM tumor cells). Interestingly, the enrichment of these signatures in CTCs and BM tumor cells was progressively more pronounced from SMM to NDMM and RRMM. Altogether, these data suggest that the CTC-based dissemination potential peaks at the stage of NDMM, which could be related to greater inflammation in BM and cell cycle arrest driving tumor cell egression into PB. There were significant associations between the percentage of CTCs and the 2/20/20 IMWG risk model in SMM, the ISS in NDMM, and high-risk cytogenetics in all three-disease settings. Untreated SMM patients (n=230) with high CTC levels (\u22650.02%) showed ultra-high risk of transformation vs those with low and undetectable CTCs (median TTP of 11 months vs not reached [NR] in both; P < .0001). Notably, SMM patients with \u22650.02% CTCs enrolled in GEM-CESAR have not reached a median TTP; thus, early intervention abrogated the poor prognosis of high CTC levels. Transplant-eligible NDMM patients stratified by undetectable, low and high (\u22650.2%) CTC levels showed median PFS of NR, 78 and 47 months, respectively ( P < .0001). Significant risk stratification was further observed in transplant ineligible NDMM (median PFS: NR, 31 and 14 months, respectively, P = .002) and RRMM (median PFS: NR, 24 and 7 months, respectively, P = .004). In untreated SMM, multivariate analysis of TTP including CTCs, serum M-component (>2 g/dL), sFLC ratio (>20) and BM plasma cells (>20%) selected CTCs as an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.61, P = .015) together with the M-component and sFLC ratio. In NDMM, multivariate analysis of PFS including CTCs, BM plasma cells counts by morphology and flow cytometry, ISS, LDH, cytogenetics and transplant eligibility showed that high CTC levels had independent prognostic value (HR: 1.43, P = .003). Only the achievement of undetectable measurable residual disease (MRD) abrogated the poor prognosis of high CTC levels. Conclusions: This is the largest study investigating the role of CTCs in smoldering and active MM. Our results show that tumor cells are continuously trafficking in PB, possibly through a dynamic mechanism of egression that peaks in NDMM. Evaluation of CTCs in PB outperformed quantification of BM tumor burden in SMM and NDMM, and showed prognostic value in all three-disease stages. Thus, CTC assessment should be part of the diagnostic workup of MM. Early intervention in high risk SMM and undetectable MRD in NDMM may abrogate dismal outcomes associated with high CTC levels.
