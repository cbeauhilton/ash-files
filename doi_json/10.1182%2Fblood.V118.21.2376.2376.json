    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2376 Thrombopoietin (TPO) is recognized as the main regulator of platelet production, yet its genetic ablation in mice does not completely obliterate thrombopoiesis, suggesting that alternate pathways could lead to platelet formation. We recently identified a naturally-occurring protein that acts as a potent agonist of platelet production by a mechanism distinct from that of TPO. This protein belongs to a novel class of human extracellular signaling proteins called physiocrines that are generated from tRNA synthetases by alternative splicing or proteolysis. Physiocrines interact with several classes of receptors through unique mechanisms to modulate cellular differentiation and tissue homeostasis in normal and pathological processes. The newly identified thrombopoietic physiocrine, termed ATYR0030, is an engineered version of a naturally-occurring physiocrine derived from the tyrosyl tRNA synthetase (YRS). In vivo , systemic administration of ATYR0030 or YRS physiocrine to rats led to an increase in platelets counts comparable to that seen with TPO treatment, but with a greater effect in animals with low baseline platelet levels. When injected into normal animals preselected for low platelet counts, ATYR0030 treatment resulted in an increase in platelets up to, but not beyond, normal levels ( Figure 1 ), suggesting a role in platelet homeostasis and differentiating its effects from the known activity of TPO. Intravenous administration of ATYR0030 also accelerated recovery of platelet counts in carboplatin-treated rats, indicating a possible role in bone marrow reconstitution after chemical insult. Consistent with homeostatic properties, no toxicity was seen in a repeat-dose 28-day non-GLP safety study in rats dosed up to 100-fold above the efficacious range. Histopathology assessment revealed no tissue abnormalities, no increase in bone marrow reticulin and no hyperplasia of myeloid precursors. Clinical chemistry and hematology parameters were in the normal range with a modest increase in platelet counts, as anticipated in animals with normal platelet levels.

In contrast to TPO, ATYR0030 does not directly signal through the TPO receptor and does not activate the JAK/STAT pathway but rather appears to engage specific G-protein coupled receptors. In vitro , ATYR0030 does not stimulate proliferation of cultured M07e human megakaryoblasts or primary bone marrow cells isolated from AML patients ( Figure 2 ). The parent synthetase is present in human platelets and is secreted in response to platelet activation, perhaps providing a feedback mechanism to stimulate the release of new platelets. In an effort to link the biological activity of ATYR0030 and the role that the parent synthetase plays in human physiology, we have begun to analyze samples from patients with abnormal platelets counts to determine circulating levels of the parent synthetase. View large Download slide View large Download slide Close modal The unique thrombopoietic activity of ATYR0030 may lead to an orthogonal approach to restoring normal platelet levels in thrombocytopenic patients who currently have limited treatment options. For example, in the myelodysplastic syndrome population, TPO-receptor agonists carry a risk of stimulating blast proliferation and accelerating disease progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The distinct proliferation profile of ATYR0030 may translate into important safety benefits by reducing the risk of progression to AML. In addition, the potential role of ATYR0030 in regulating platelet homeostasis may provide a greater safety margin in the normalization of platelet levels, thereby also limiting the risk of thrombosis. Leveraging the therapeutic potential of this thrombopoietic physiocrine may lead to the development of a novel treatment option with a favorable safety profile.
