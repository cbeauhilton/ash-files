    "abstract_text": "Transplant strategies involving natural killer (NK) cell alloreactivity (KIR-ligand mismatch [KIR-L mismatch]) have demonstrated superior outcomes for patients receiving T cell depleted HLA haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell allografts. It is unknown whether KIR-L mismatch has a similar effect in recipients of partially HLA-matched umbilical cord blood (UCB) grafts which contain comparatively few T-cells. We examined the clinical impact of KIR-L mismatch in 257 UCB recipients treated with either a myeloablative (n=155) or reduced intensity (n=102) regimen. After myeloablative conditioning, KIR-L mismatch had no demonstrable effect on grades III\u2013IV acute GVHD (17% [CI, 6\u201328%] vs. 17% [CI, 10\u201324], p=.97), transplant-related mortality (TRM) (27% [CI, 14\u201340%] vs. 18% [CI, 11\u201325%], p=.19), relapse at 2 yrs (18% [95%CI, 6\u201330%] vs. 28% [95%CI, 19\u201327%], p=.37) and survival at 3 yrs (50% [CI, 32\u201368%] vs. 57% [CI, 47\u201367%], p=.46). In contrast, following reduced intensity conditioning when the engrafting unit was KIR-L mismatched there was a significantly higher incidence of grades III\u2013IV acute GVHD (42% [CI, 27\u201359) vs. 13% [CI, 5\u201321], p < .01). Multivariate analysis confirmed NK cell alloreactivity as the only predictive factor associated with severe acute GVHD was (RR 1.8, CI [1.1\u20132.9]; p=.02). TRM was higher (27% [CI, 12\u201342%] vs. 12% [CI, 5\u201319%], p=.03) and three year survival was poorer (32% [CI, 15\u201359%] vs. 52% [CI, 47\u201367%], p=.03) when the engrafting unit was KIR-L mismatched, but relapse was unaffected (39% [95%CI, 21\u201357%] vs. 47% [95%CI, 34\u201360%], p=.72). KIR-L mismatch in recipients of a RIC UCB transplant was associated with a significant increased risk of death (RR 1.8, 95%CI, 1.0\u20133.1, p=.05). This data identify divergent effects of NK cell alloreactivity which are unmasked when comparing myeloablative versus RIC transplant platforms. We conclude that KIR-L mismatch should be avoided in recipients of a reduced intensity UCB transplant.",
