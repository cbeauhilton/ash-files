    "abstract_text": "Introduction: JAK2, which is located on chromosome 9p24, encodes a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase involved in cytokine-mediated signal transduction, and is fused to 10 partner genes in hematological malignancies, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia, atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome/ myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), and Hodgkin lymphoma with 9p24 translocations. Furthermore, a somatic acquired activating mutation of JAK2 (V617F) was noted in a majority of patients with MPN, and mutations at R683 of JAK2 was detected not only in ALL with Down syndrome, but also in high-risk pediatric B-cell progenitor (BCP)-ALL. Case presentation: A 14-year-old boy presenting with a persistent fever was admitted to our hospital because of hyperleukocytosis and thrombocytopenia. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated the 46,XY,t(9;17)(p24;q21) in 17 of 20 bone marrow cells. He was classified as extremely high risk BCP-ALL with myeloid marker and treated on TCCSG L95-14 HEX/SCT protocol. He obtained a complete remission after the induction therapy, relapsed after 7 months. Although he underwent an auto bone marrow transplant because he had no matched donor, 19 months after the initial diagnosis, he died due to progressive disease. Materials&Methods: To characterize the breakpoints, FISH analysis was performed on metaphase chromosome using BAC clones closely flanking JAK2 . Genomic DNA and total RNA were isolated from bone marrow cells at diagnosis and relapse. For the mRNA-Seq sample preparation, sequencing libraries were generated according to the standard Illumina protocol for high-throughput sequencing. Using a HiSeq 2000 sequencer, 100 bp-paired end reads were obtained. Mapping reads to genes were performed by using a Bowtie software and fusion transcript discovery was done by a deFuse data analysis software. We evaluated DNA copy number changes by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis and Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis. Results: FISH showed a fusion signal on normal chromosome 9, and split signals on der(9) and der(17). We identified a novel JAK2 fusion gene by paired-end mRNA-seq. This fusion transcript was identified. RT-PCR followed by direct sequencing confirmed the in-frame fusion of SPAG9 exon 26 and JAK2 exon 19. Moreover, the homozygous deletion of CDKN2A, TRG, TRA/D, and IGH and hemizygous deletion of CDKN2B, PAX5, BTG1 , CDK6, TRB, ADARB2, IGL and IKZF1 were identified by MLPA and SNP array. Discussion: This ALL having both rearrangement activating tyrosine kinase and genomic lesions affecting lymphoid transcription factors is similar to the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)/ BCR-ABL1 like ALL subgroup. In conclusion, we have identified SPAG9 as a novel fusion partner of JAK2 gene in adolescent BCP-ALL as a consequence of a t(9;17)(p24;q21). The further examination of this fusion gene may be worthwhile to consider that JAK2 would be a good target for treatment in refractory ALL patients with rearrangements in JAK2 .
