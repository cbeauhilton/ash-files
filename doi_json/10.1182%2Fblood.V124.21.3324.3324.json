    "abstract_text": "Background: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common adult leukemia in the western world, remains an incurable B-cell malignancy. It is characterized by the accumulation of malignant mature B cells in the blood, lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. CLL cells display up-regulated B-cell receptor (BCR) activation, which maintains B cell survival and proliferation through transmitting microenvironmental stimuli. Due to aberrant regulation of the BCR, CLL cells display constitutively activated survival and proliferation pathways, such as phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) and Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK) pathways. Small molecules that target such kinases in the BCR pathway have shown significant clinical activity in CLL patients. Both the PI3K p110\u03b4 inhibitor, idelalisib, and the BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib, have received approval by FDA for treatment of relapsed CLL. However, patients still relapse on these therapies. Methods/Results: Here we use pharmacologic and genetic approaches to further characterize the role of PI3K signaling in the leukemia pathogenesis in the CLL cell and in the microenvironment. We describe that a PI3K p110\u03b4 and p110\u03b3 inhibitor, duvelisib (IPI-145), which is in late stage clinical development, attenuates pro-survival signals in the OSU-CLL cell line and primary human and murine CLL cells and promotes apoptosis and downstream pathway inactivation in primary human and murine CLL cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. To examine the cytotoxicity of duvelisib in normal immune cells, we incubated whole blood from CLL patients with 0.25-5 \u03bcM duvelisib for 48 hours and analyzed by flow cytometry for absolute count of live CD3 + T cells, CD56 + NK cells and CD19 + B cells. T cells and NK cells were sensitive to duvelisib, displaying about 20% decrease in viability at concentrations greater than 0.5\u03bcM; however, the B cell population showed about 50% decrease in viability. To specifically examine normal B cells, we isolated CD19 + B cells from healthy volunteer blood and incubated with 1 \u03bcM duvelisib for 48 hours and observed no cytotoxicity, despite observing a significant decrease in CLL cells viability under the same conditions. Additionally, duvelisib is highly effective at reducing downstream PI3K signaling in a B cell line with the ibrutinib resistance conferring BTK C481S mutation. Genetically we show that the PI3K p110\u03b4-inactivating and the TCL1 leukemia murine models can be utilized to further explore the differential role of PI3K p110\u03b4 in the leukemic cell and microenvironment. Our study indicates that systemic disruption of PI3K p110\u03b4 function in the TCL1 mouse significantly prevents spontaneous leukemia development, indicating that PI3K p110\u03b4 is a critical kinase for CLL disease initiation and expansion. Moreover, inactivation of PI3K p110\u03b4 in the microenvironment showed a dose-dependent effect in delaying leukemia engraftment. This suggests that PI3K p110\u03b4 activity is also critical in the non-B cell compartment for leukemia progression. While our group has focused on the role of PI3K p110\u03b4, we continue to examine the role of PI3K p110\u03b3 using the PI3K p110\u03b4 and p110\u03b3 inhibitor, duvelisib.
