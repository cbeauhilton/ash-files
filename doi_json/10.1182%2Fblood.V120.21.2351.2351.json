    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2351 Stem cells reside in a physical niche. The organization of cellular niches has been shown to play a key role in regulating normal stem cell differentiation, stem cell maintenance and regeneration. Various stem cell niches have been shown to be hypoxic, thereby maintaining the stem cell phenotype of e.g. hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or cancer stem cells. The bone marrow (BM) niche is a rich reservoir of tissue-specific pluripotent HSCs. Proteases such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in cell movement, partly due to their proteolytic function, and they have been linked to cellular processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation. The proteolytic function of Membrane-type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP/MMP-14) is essential for angiogenesis, arthritis and tumour growth. Recently, it has been reported that MT1-MMP is highly expressed in HSCs and stromal/niche cells. However the clear function of MT1-MMP in hematopoiesis is not well understood. To reveal the functional consequences of MT1-MMP deficiency for post-natal hematopoiesis in vivo , we have taken advantage of MT1-MMP \u2212/\u2212 mice to demonstrate that MT1-MMP deficiency leads to impaired steady state hematopoiesis of all hematopoietic cell lineages. In a search for factors whose deficiency could cause this hematopoietic phenotype, we found not only reduced protein release, but also reduced transcription of the following growth factors/chemokines in MT1-MMP \u2212/\u2212 mice: erythropoietin (Epo), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1a/CXCL12), interleukin-7 (IL-7) and Kit ligand (KitL, also known as stem cell factor). All of these factors, except for Epo, are typical stromal cell-derived factors. To ensure that impaired gene transcription in vivo was not due to a lower number of stromal cells in vivo , we demonstrated that MT1-MMP knockdown in stromal cells in vitro also reduced transcription of the stromal cell derived factors SDF-1a/CXCL12, IL-7 and KitL. In contrast, overexpression of MT1-MMP in stromal cells enhanced gene transcription of these factors. All genes, whose transcription was altered in vitro and in vivo due to MT1-MMP deficiency, had one thing in common: their gene transcription is regulated by the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) pathway. Further mechanistic studies revealed that MT1-MMP activates the HIF-1 pathway via factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1) within niche cells, thereby inducing the transcription of HIF-responsive genes, which induce terminal hematopoietic differentiation. Thus, MT1-MMP in niche cells regulates postnatal hematopoiesis by modulating hematopoietic HIF-dependent niche factors that are critical for terminal differentiation and migration.
