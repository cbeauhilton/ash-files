    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3956 Background: Recently in large randomized studies, the addition of Rituximab to standard chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of follicular lymphoma (FL) demonstrated improvements in long-term outcome in FL. Methods: We compared the outcome of 111 naive FL patients (pts) treated at our institution from 1995 to 2009 with a single alkylating agent in combination or not with Rituximab: 58 pts received Chlorambucil plus Rituximab (R-Chl) and 53 pts Chlorambucil and prednisone (Chl+PDN). The 2 schedules included an induction phase, where Chlorambucil was given at 6mg/mq for 6 consecutive weeks in both groups and the Rituximab in 4 weekly administrations. The maintenance phase was longer in the Chl+PDN group: Chlorambucil was administered 6mg/mq daily 14 days each month for a total of 12-months of treatment versus 14 days with monthly-Rituximab for 4 consecutive months in the R-Chl group. Results: The demographic and prognostic factors are reported in Table 1 .  . R-Chlorambucil (58 pts) . Chlorambucil+prednisone (53 pts) .

No significant incidence of adverse events were reported and only one HBsAg positive patient in R-Chl group discontinued the therapy. One case of myelodysplastic syndrome was described in a Chl+PDN relapsed patient. With a median follow up of 34 months, the OS and the EFS in R-Chl pts is 95% and 76% respectively. Otherwise, with a median observation time of 82 months in the Chl+PDN group 73% are alive and only 28% of pts maintained the response. The median time to subsequent therapy (TTST) is 21 and 15 months respectively in the 2 groups. Conclusions: The addition of Rituximab to alkylating in first-line treatment in previously untreated FL pts improves significantly the EFS and prolongs the time to next antilymphoma therapy compared with alkylating alone. Because of its low toxicity profile, our combination with Rituximab and Chlorambucil could be considered a first-line therapy, especially in FL patients not eligible for aggressive chemotherapy regimens.
