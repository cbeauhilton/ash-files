    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the t(9:22) translocation known as the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), imatinib and second-generation ABL TKIs, nilotinib and dasatinib have demonstrated the potency against CML patients. However, resistance to ABL TKI can develop in CML patients due to BCR-ABL point mutations. Moreover, ABL TKIs do not eliminate the leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Therefore, new approach against BCR-ABL mutant cells and LSCs may improve the outcome of Ph-positive leukemia patients. In eukaryotic cells, histone acetylation/deacetylation is important in transcriptional regulation. Chromatin acetylation is controlled by the opposing effects of two families of enzymes: histone acetyltransferases (HAT) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Deregulation of HDAC activity may be a cause of malignant disease in humans. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway also regulates cell metabolism, proliferation and survival. Furthermore, aberrant activation of PI3K signaling pathway has been shown to be important in initiation maintenance of human cancers. CUDC-907 is an oral inhibitor of class I PI3K as well as class I and II HDAC enzymes. CUDC-907 is currently being investigated in a pivotal phase 1 clinical trial against hematological malignancies such as malignant lymphoma. We suggested that CUDC-907 mediated inhibition PI3K and HDAC activity and in combination with ABL TKIs may abrogate the proliferation and survival of Ph-positive leukemia cells including T315I mutation and ABL TKI resistant. Materials and methods: In this study, we investigated the combination therapy with a CUDC-907 and an ABL TKIs (imatinib, nilotinib and ponatinib) by using the BCR-ABL positive cell line, K562, murine Ba/F3 cell line which was transfected with T315I mutant, nilotinib resistant K562 and ponatinib resistant Ba/F3 cells and primary samples. Results: The treatment of imatinib, nilotinib and ponatinib exhibits cell growth inhibition partially against K562 cells in the presence of feeder cell (HS-5). We found that mRNA of PI3K subunit is significantly increased after a co-culture with HS-5 in K562 and primary CD34 positive CML samples. 72 h treatment of CUDC-907 exhibits cell growth inhibition and induced apoptosis against K562 cells in a dose dependent manner. We examined the intracellular signaling after treatment of CUDC-907. Phosphorylation of JNK, histone acetylation and activity of caspase 3, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was increased. Anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1 was decreased in a dose dependent. We next investigated the efficacy between imatinib and CUDC-907 by using these cell line. Combined treatment of K562 cells with imatinib and CUDC-907 caused significantly more cytotoxicity than each drug alone. Caspase activity was increased and Akt activity was reduced. Phosphorylation of BCR-ABL, Crk-L was reduced and cleaved PARP was increased after imatinib and CUDC-907 treatment. We investigated the CUDC-907 activity against T315I positive cells. CUDC-907 potently induced cell growth inhibition of Ba/F3 T315I cells in a dose dependent manner. Combined treatment of Ba/F3 T315I cells with ponatinib and CUDC-907 caused significantly more cytotoxicity than each drug alone. Caspase activity was increased and Akt activity was reduced after ponatinib and CUDC-907 treatment. To assess the activity of ponatinib and CUDC-907, we performed to test on tumor formation in mice. We injected nude mice subcutaneously with Ba/F3 T315I mutant cells. A dose of 20 mg/kg/day p.o of ponatinib and 30 mg/kg/day p.o of CUDC-907 inhibited tumor growth and reduced tumor volume compared with control mice. The treatments were well tolerated with no animal health concerns observed. We also found that the treatment of CUDC-907 exhibits cell growth inhibition against Ba/F3 ponatinib resistant cells, K562 nilotinib resistant cells, T315I mutant primary samples and CD34 positive CML samples. Conclusion: These results indicated that administration of the dual PI3K and HDAC inhibitor, CUDC-907 may be a powerful strategy against ABL TKI resistant cells including T315I mutation and enhance cytotoxic effects of ABL TKI against those Ph-positive leukemia cells.
