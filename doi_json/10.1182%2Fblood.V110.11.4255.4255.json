    "abstract_text": "Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) is a rare hematological malignancy. Childhood AMKL is classified into three categories including AMKL associated with Down syndrome (AMKL-DS), AMKL with t(1;22)(p13;q13)/RBM15-MKL1, and others. Previous studies have revealed AMKL with t(1;22)(p13;q13) occurs mainly in infant with poor prognosis, and patients with AMKL-DS generally show favorable course, mostly associated with GATA-1 mutation. Appropriate treatment strategy and the role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) remained controversial in childhood AMKL. Cases and Methods: Eleven cases with AMKL were analyzed and reviewed. Cytogenetic analysis was performed with G banding. Expression of RBM15-MKL1 was analyzed with RT-PCR method on seven cases with the material available. Results. The age at onset ranged from 6 months to 2 years and 6 months. Three were males and eight females. Five of 11 cases were AMKL-DS. Three were AMKL with t(1;22)(p13;q13), of which both two cases analyzed express RBM15-MKL1. Translocation at 11q23 was confirmed in two. Preceding MDS had been confirmed in one AMKL-DS and one AMKL with t(1;22)(p13;q13). The treatment differed among the cases; however, the regimens including high dose cytarabine (HD-CA) were utilized as first-line therapy in eight cases out of 11, resulting in long term remission in five. In particular, three AMKL with t(1;22)(p13;q13) attained long term remission with HD-CA containg regimen. Three cases underwent SCT on disease and two of three remain in remission for 7 years and 4 months, respectively. Two poor prognostic AMKL-DS cases had breakpoint at 22q13 where MKL1 resides and at 17p13 where TP53 is localized. Discussion. Childhood AMKL is heterogenous on cytogenetic/molecular aspects. HD-CA containing regimens might have favorable effect even on AMKL with t(1;22)(p13;q13) and the other poor prognostic AMKL. SCT might be effective even for refractory disease. patient characteristics  case . sex . age at onset . clinical feature . karyotype .
