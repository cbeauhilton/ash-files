    "abstract_text": "Background Epigenetic therapeutics such as the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, vorinostat, and the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) I inhibitor, azacitidine, sensitize AML cells in vitro to the CD33-targeting immunoconjugate, gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO). This observation, together with the improved clinical activity when HDAC inhibitors are used with DNMT inhibitors, prompted a phase 1/2 study (NCT00895934) of GO with vorinostat and azacitidine for primary refractory AML or AML in first relapse (remission duration \u226412 months) requiring 1 st salvage therapy. Methods Patients aged \u226550 years were eligible if they had an ECOG performance status of 0-3 and had adequate organ function. Patients with prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) were eligible if relapse occurred 6-12 months post-transplant. Excluded were patients with a second active malignancy, prior treatment with any of the study drugs, or central nervous system disease. Hydroxyurea was given to reduce the total white blood cell count to 48 hours that results in >7 day delay of the subsequent treatment cycle, with the exception of febrile neutropenia or infection; 2) any grade \u22654 non-hematologic toxicity, with the exception of febrile neutropenia/infection or constitutional symptoms if recovery to grade \u22642 within 14 days; and 3) prolonged myelosuppression (platelet count <20,000/\u03bcL and/or absolute neutrophil count <500/\u03bcL at day 42 after treatment in patients without evidence of persistent leukemia). During phase 2, a Simon minimax two-stage design was to monitor whether a response rate of 0.34 was reached, with type I and II errors set at 0.1 and assuming a historical CR rate of 17% in these patients. Results 52 eligible patients, median age 64.8 (range, 50.2-78.9) years, with either primary refractory disease (n=29) or first relapse (n=23; median duration of first CR: 3 months) were enrolled and received a median of 2 (range, 1-4) cycles of therapy. During dose escalation, 1 DLT (death due to sepsis and respiratory failure) occurred at the 4 th tested dose level after cycle 1, identifying vorinostat (400 mg/day orally from days 1-9), azacitidine (75 mg/m 2 /day IV or SC from days 1-7), and GO (3 mg/m 2 /day IV on days 4 and 8) as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). A total of 43 patients received therapy at the MTD level. Ten of these achieved CR, while 8 achieved CRi, for a CR/CRi rate of 18/43 (41.9%; exact 95% CI: 27.0-57.9%). Thirteen of the 18 patients that achieved CR/CRi were taken off protocol to receive additional, more intensive consolidative chemotherapy, including HCT (n=12). Of these 18 patients, 5 relapsed after a median of 122 (38-146) days, while 3 died while in remission after a CR duration of 46, 97, and 130 days, and 10 are in ongoing remission after a median of 326 (68- 710) days, respectively. Median overall survival for the 18 patients achieving CR/CRi was significantly longer than for those 21 patients who failed therapy but lived at least 29 days (i.e. did not experience treatment-related mortality) after treatment initiation (224.5 [range 70-798]) vs. 95 [36-900] days, log rank P -value=0.0023). Four patients died within 28 days of treatment initiation. Besides grade 3-4 cytopenias, infectious complications were the most common grade 3 3 adverse events. Only 1 patient developed possible liver toxicity (abdominal pain/distention and mild ascites) after 4 cycles of therapy, although bilirubin and transaminases were only minimally elevated and doppler studies were unremarkable. Conclusion Our study indicates that GO in combination with vorinostat and azacitidine has encouraging anti-AML activity in older adults with relapsed/refractory AML.
