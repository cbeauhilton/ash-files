    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Previously we identified B-cell lineage leukemic lymphoblasts as a new expression site for subunit A of blood coagulation factor XIII (FXIIIA) 1 . On the basis of FXIIIA expression, various subgroups of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) can be identified. Methods. Fifty-five children with BCP-ALL treated within the frame of BFM ALL-IC 2002 clinical trial were studied retrospectively. Bone marrow samples were obtained by aspiration and the expression of FXIIIA was detected by flow cytometry. G-banding and fluorescent in situ hybridization was performed according to standard procedures. Results. The 10-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rate of FXIIIA-positive and FXIIIA-negative patients showed significant differences (EFS: 84% vs. 61%, respectively; p=0.031; OS: 89% vs. 61%; p=0.008). Of all the parameters examined, the only correlation was between the lack of FXIIIA expression and 'B-other' genetic subgroup. Further multivariate Cox regression analysis of FXIII-subtype and genetic group or 'B-other' subgroup identified FXIIIA-negative characteristics as an independent predictor for poor outcome in BCP-ALL. Conclusion. We found an excellent correlation between long-term survival and FXIIIA-positive phenotype of lymphoblasts in de novo childhood BCP-ALL. The results presented seem to be convincing enough to suggest a possible role for FXIIIA expression in the prognostic grouping of childhood BCP-ALL patients. In addition, lack of FXIIIA expression is associated with the 'B-other' characteristics, therefore, FXIIIA can help to identify those cases that may require further detailed genetic examination by using expensive methods.
