    "abstract_text": "CD38 is a validated target for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Daratumumab (Darzalex\u00ae), an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (mAb), has shown great clinical efficacy and has been approved for multiple myeloma treatment. However, both primary refractoriness and development of resistance to daratumumab therapy have been reported. Based on the therapeutic benefits of this CD38 antibody, we developed a CD38-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), employing a fully human anti-CD38 antibody STI-6129, identified from Sorrento's G-MAB\u00ae antibody library, and proprietary linker-toxin technology. The toxin payload is duostatin 5.2 (Duo.5.2), a microtubule inhibitor, conjugated to STI-6129 via a non-polyethylene glycol linker resulting in our lead ADC CD38-077. Cell binding studies showed that it specifically binds to CD38-positive tumor cells but not CD38-negative cell lines. The cell binding was proportional to the CD38 expression level on the cell surface. The ADC was internalized into CD38-positive cells at a rate comparable to that of the unconjugated antibody, indicating that conjugation did not change the binding characteristics of STI-6129 to its antigen. In cytotoxicity studies, CD38-077 exhibited a CD38-dependent cytotoxic activity against a panel of CD38-expressing tumor cell lines and was more potent in cells with high CD38 expression. The cytotoxic effect of CD38-077 was also examined against human PBMC cells, as it has been reported that certain types of the immune cells express CD38. The result indicated that normal PBMC cells were generally insensitive to the ADC up to 1 \u00b5M following 120 hr exposure. We investigated the anti-tumor activity of CD38-077 in xenograft animal models of Burkitt's lymphoma and two different multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines. The studies evaluated different dose levels and dosing regimens, including single dose and multiple doses at various intervals. The data showed that the ADC has a broad, potent and CD38-dependent in vivo efficacy in all three xenograft tumor models examined. In a pharmacokinetic study in na\u00efve mice, CD38-077 was found to be stable, with T 1/2 of about 7-11 days, comparable to that of the unconjugated STI-6129 antibody. In summary, CD38-077 exhibits strong anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. The ADC showed specific activity towards CD38-expressing tumors but was less active against CD38-expressing normal PBMC cells, which express relatively low levels of CD38 level and where internalization was not detectable. These results warrant further development exploration of CD38-077. Disclosures Li: Concortis Biotherapeutics: Employment, Equity Ownership. Lau: Levena Biopharma: Employment, Equity Ownership.
