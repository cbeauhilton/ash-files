    "abstract_text": "MDS is characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis with increased intramedullary apoptosis which has been correlated in turn with high levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- \u03b1. Previously, we showed that TNF-\u03b1 strongly upregulates the secretion of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and -9 in normal CD34 + cells. Elevated expression of MMPs has been suggested to contribute to cancer progression and leukemic dissemination and MMPs also facilitate the secretion of TNF-\u03b1. In this work, we hypothesized that TNF-\u03b1-induced MMP production plays a role in the progression of MDS. We therefore examined the effects of recombinant human (rh) TNF-\u03b1 on the expression and secretion of MMP-2, MMP-9 and membrane type (MT) 1-MMP (known activator of MMP-2), by MNC from MDS patients (using RT-PCR, zymography and Western blotting), as well as the effects of TNF-\u03b1 on migration of MDS MNC across the reconstituted basement membrane Matrigel. We observed higher mean levels of TNF-\u03b1 in media conditioned by mononuclear cells (MNC) obtained from 20 patients diagnosed with MDS (RAEB-T (4); RAEB (5), RA (10) and RARS (1)) in comparison to normal controls. We found that (i) MMP-9 is secreted by MDS MNC and this secretion is increased by TNF-\u03b1, (ii) MT1-MMP is expressed by the majority of MDS MNC and this expression is upregulated by TNF-\u03b1, and (iii) MMP-2 is detectable only in RAEB-T MNC samples and is activated by TNF-\u03b1. TNF-\u03b1 also stimulated the migration of MDS MNC across Matrigel, which was inhibited by the inhibitor of MT1-MMP, epigallocatechin-3-gallate. Moreover, Enbrel (soluble TNF receptor fusion protein), which blocks TNF-\u03b1, also inhibited the expression of MT1-MMP and secretion of MMP-9 by MDS MNC as well as their migration across Matrigel. In addition, we observed increased activation of the latent form of MMP-2 in co-cultures of MDS MNC with bone marrow fibroblastic cells. We suggest that in MDS patients, TNF-\u03b1 stimulates the expression of MMP-9 and MT1-MMP, inducing a highly proteolytic environment in bone marrow which could further increase processing and secretion of endogenous TNF-\u03b1. Therefore, we suggest that use of TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors combined with MMP inhibitors could have therapeutic value in abrogating the progression of MDS.",
