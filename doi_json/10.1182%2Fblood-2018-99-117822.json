    "abstract_text": "Background: The frequency of preventive health practices (PHP), including age-appropriate screening for malignancies and immunizations, and compliance with PHP guidelines in lymphoma survivors is not known. We hypothesized that lymphoma survivors are more compliant with PHP than the general population but PHP rates may differ based on patient, disease and treatment characteristics. Methods: We identified eligible lymphoma patients from the SPORE Molecular Epidemiology Resource (MER) cohort, in which they were prospectively enrolled within 50 years and compliant if they had fecal occult blood test <1 year or sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy <10 years of FU3. Eligible female survivors age 50-75 were considered compliant if they had a mammogram after lymphoma diagnosis. Since USPTF recommended against PSA for prostate cancer screening in 2012, males aged 55-69 prior to 2012 were eligible and considered compliant if PSA test was <1 years of FU3. Survivors who received influenza vaccine <1 year of FU3 were considered compliant. Chi-square test was used to compare characteristics of compliant vs non-compliant patients; p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Of 4248 lymphoma patients enrolled in the MER from 2002 to 2012, 2038 participants completed FU3. 1105 (54%) were male. The median age at diagnosis was 61 (IQR 51-69) years. There were equal numbers of indolent (N=1002) and aggressive (N=995) histologies with follicular (N=515, 25%) and diffuse large B-cell (N=427, 21%) being the most common. Majority (N=1221, 60%) had advanced stage (Ann Arbor III-IV) disease. 469 (23%) had events prior to FU3 and majority 1777 (88%) had received lymphoma treatment prior to FU3. Of 2038 survivors who completed FU3, 1576 (79%) reported having colon cancer screening in their lifetime. 1328 (91%) of 1570 eligible survivors were compliant, 124 (9%) were not and 118 had missing information. Survivors of age >60 years (93% vs 88%, p<0.001), those with indolent lymphomas (93% vs 90%, p=0.046), or diagnosed between 2010-2012 (94% vs 90% 2002-2009, p=0.007) were more likely to be compliant. There was no difference in colon cancer screening by sex, events prior to FU3 or treatment prior to FU3. 872 (96%) of 933 female survivors reported having a breast exam and 836 (91%) had a mammogram at least once in their lifetime. 495 (96%) of 561 eligible female survivors were compliant, 23 (4%) were not and 43 had missing information. There was no difference in mammographic screening based on age (60), histology (indolent vs aggressive), events prior to FU3, treatment prior to FU3 or year of diagnosis (2010-2012 vs 2002-2009). 737 (78%) of 1105 male survivors had a PSA test at least once in their lifetime. 115 (71%) of 216 eligible men were compliant, 47 (29%) were not and 54 had missing information. There was no difference in PSA screening by age (60), histology (indolent vs aggressive), events prior to FU3, and treatment prior to FU3. 1818/2038 (90%) survivors had received an influenza vaccine in their lifetime. 1567 (81%) were compliant, 373 (19%) were not and 98 had missing information. Survivors >60 years of age (87% vs 75%, p<0.001) and those with indolent lymphoma (83% vs 78%, p=0.015) were more likely to be compliant. There was no difference in influenza vaccination by sex, events prior to FU3, treatment prior to FU3, and year of diagnosis (2010-2012 vs 2002-2009). As a comparison in the US general population [Figure], between 2002-2015 the highest rates published by the Center for Disease Control are 62% for colon cancer screening (2015), 75% for mammography (insured, 2003) and influenza vaccination 42% (2015). Per the American Cancer Society, the highest rate of PSA screening was 54% (2010). Conclusion: Lymphoma survivors have high compliance with PHP recommendations compared to the general population. Although older individuals and those with indolent histologies were more likely to receive influenza vaccination and colon cancer screening, this difference was not seen in breast and prostate cancer screening practices. Lymphoma treatment and events did not seem to affect the frequency of PHP among survivors. Figure. View large Download slide Figure.
