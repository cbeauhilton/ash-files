    "abstract_text": "In order to understand the mechanisms underlying the increased rates of stem cell transplant rejection in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) we have developed a mouse model of transplant rejection utilizing the Berkeley SCD mouse. We find that Berkeley SCD mice exhibit a significantly higher rate of transplant rejection when transplanted with fully allogeneic bone marrow from an SJL donor after non-myeloablative conditioning and peri-transplant T cell costimulation blockade. Thus, while control C57BL/6 (BL/6) mice or hemizygous litter-mates exhibit 80\u201385% engraftment rates, only 20% of Berkeley SCD mice engraft with donor marrow. Transplant rejection in the SCD mice is mediated by CD8+ and/or NK1.1+ cells, as depletion with antibodies directed at either of these cell-surface molecules increases engraftment rates to 75\u201390%. To dissect the mechanistic underpinnings of these observations, we performed a multiparameter phenotypic and functional flow-cytometric analysis of leukocytes from the peripheral blood, lymph nodes and spleen from SCD mice, and compared them to the two non-SCD controls. We observed that SCD mice displayed striking phenotypic differences compared to normal mice, but that their hemizygous litter-mates were indistinguishable from the BL/6 controls, underscoring the sickle-specific nature of our observations. SCD mice showed minimal phenotypic variation in the peripheral blood, but the spleens and lymph nodes from SCD mice were highly abnormal. Sickle mice exhibited \u223c10-fold more splenic NK and NK-T cells than either the BL/6 or hemizygous controls. These cells produced large quantities of both TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, potentially contributing to the inflammatory milleu that is associated with SCD. Furthermore, while absolute numbers of splenic T cells were not different in sickle mice compared to controls, their phenotype was skewed toward a highly activated state. Thus, while many (40%) splenic memory T cells from normal controls exhibited a Central Memory (Tcm) phenotype, there were fewer Tcm cells in SCD mice (6%), and a skewing of the memory repertoire towards a more activated Intermediate Memory phenotype (71% in SCD mice compared to 25% in controls). Finally, in ELISpot analysis, lymph node cells from naive sickle mice, having never been previously exposed to allo-antigen, were able to secrete IFN-\u03b3 when briefly co-cultured with donor SJL stimulators, a phenomenon not observed with either control BL/6 or hemizygous controls, again, pointing to the increased inflammatory milieu and potential for rejection in the sickle mice. In summary, we have observed evidence for a multi-faceted increase in immune activation in SCD mice, which correlates with their increased transplant rejection. These results point both toward possible therapeutic targets aimed at decreasing SCD-mediated transplant rejection and toward future studies in SCD patients, in order to determine whether similar mechanisms of immune activation also occur in the patient population.",
