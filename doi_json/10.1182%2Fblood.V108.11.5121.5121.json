    "abstract_text": "Osteonecrosis of the jaw or maxilla (ONJM) is a rare but clinically significant disorder recently reviewed in a large retrospective study by our group (Hoff et al, 27 th ASBMR Meeting 2005, Presentation #1218). A subset of the ONJM patients with breast cancer or myeloma was followed at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) dental clinic. This analysis describes the natural history of ONJM in this subset. Thirteen of 29 ONJM patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates (IVBP) at UTMDACC and 1 ONJM patient treated elsewhere were evaluated in the dental clinic for more than 6 months (myeloma, n=7; breast cancer, n=7). Measurement of the maximum length of exposed bone was documented at each visit. Each patient received a standard regimen of conservative dental care with debridement only when indicated. All patients received zoledronic acid (mean cumulative dose 80mg; range 24\u2013152mg) and 10 patients also received pamidronate (mean cumulative dose 1665mg; range 90\u20132700mg). This subset was followed for a median duration of 18.2 months (range: 7.1\u201367.3 months). The mean length of exposed bone at initial evaluation was 11 mm (range: 2\u201329 mm). The lesion from baseline to the most recent clinic visit progressed in 7 patients (50%), remained stable in 2 (14%), regressed in 2 (14%), and resolved in 3 (21%). Persistent ONJ was seen if IVBP was stopped (n=8), decreased in frequency (n=1), or continued at the same dose/frequency (n=2) (Graphs 1, 2). Complete resolution occurred in 3 multiple myeloma patients; IVBP was decreased in one and discontinued in 2 of the resolved cases (heavy lines on Graph 1). Our experience shows that ONJM is a disorder with slow resolution in most patients, lasting as long as 5 years. In the oncologic setting where there is clear benefit of bisphosphonate therapy, studies to optimize the dosing regimen may be needed. View large Download slide Graph 1.
