    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3064 Introduction: Perifosine (Peri) a novel, oral signal transduction modulator with multiple effects including inhibition of Akt and activation of JNK, has demonstrated clinical activity when combined with dexamethasone (Dex) in patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory MM ( ASH 2007 #1164 ). Lenalidomide (Revlimid , Rev) a novel, oral immunomodulatory drug has activity against MM when combined with Dex. We previously reported encouraging safety data and observed clinical activity of the oral triplet combination ( ASH 2008 # 3691 ). We now report the final phase I results of this study which aimed to determine the MTD and to evaluate activity of Peri + Rev + Dex, as an oral combination in pts with relapsed or refractory MM. Methods: Four cohorts ( 6 pts each) were planned, dosing Peri at 50 or 100mg (daily), Rev 15 or 25mg (d 1\u201321) and Dex 20mg (d 1\u20134, 9\u201312 and 17\u201320 for 4 cycles, then 20 mg d 1\u20134) in 28-d cycles. To limit dex-related toxicities, the protocol was amended to use weekly dex (40 mg), applying to cohorts 3, 4, and the MTD cohort. Toxicity was assessed using NCI CTCAE v3.0; DLT was defined as grade (G) 3 non-hematologic toxicity, G4 neutropenia for 5 d and/or neutropenic fever, or platelets <25,000/mm 3 on >1 occasion despite transfusion. Response was assessed by modified EBMT criteria. Pts had to have received at least 1 prior therapy and no more than 4. Pts refractory to Rev/Dex were excluded. Results: 32 pts (17M/15F, median age 64 y, range 37 \u2013 79) were enrolled; 6 pts in cohort 1 (Peri 50mg, Rev 15mg, Dex 20mg); 6 pts in cohort 2 (Peri 50mg, Rev 25mg, Dex 20mg); 8 pts in cohort 3 (Peri 100mg, Rev 15mg, Dex 40mg/wk); 6 pts in cohort 4 (Peri 100mg, Rev 25mg, Dex 40mg/wk) and 6 pts at MTD (Cohort 4). Median prior lines of treatment was 2 (range 1\u20134) with a median PS of 1. Relapsed (53%), Refractory to last therapy prior to study entry (47%). Prior therapy included dex (94%), thalidomide (75%), bortezomib (44%), and stem cell transplant (72%). Two pts (6%) were previously treated with Rev. 63% (15/24) of the prior thalidomide + dex (Thal/Dex) treated pts had progressed on a Thal/Dex regimen while 43% (6/14) of the prior bortezomib (Vel) treated pts had progressed on a prior Vel based regimen. Two pts did not complete one full cycle (non-compliance and adverse event not related to study drugs \u2013 both in cohort 3) and were not included in the efficacy analysis. 31/32 pts were evaluable for safety (non-compliant patient never took study drug and was excluded). The most common grade 1/2 events (any causality) included fatigue (48%), diarrhea (45%), upper respiratory infection (35%), nausea (32%) and hyperglycemia (32%). Grade 3/4 events > 10% included neutropenia (26%); hypophosphatemia (23%); thrombocytopenia (16%) and leucopenia (13%). There was one reported DLT in cohort 3 (Nausea). No grade 3/4 events of peripheral neuropathy or DVT were reported. Rev dose was reduced in 11 pts, Peri reduced in 9 pts and Dex reduced in 7 pts: 30 pts are evaluable for response, with best response as follows: Response: n = 30 . n (%) . ORR (\u2265PR) . Near Complete Response (nCR) 4 (7%) 15 (50%) Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) 3 (10%) Partial Response (PR) 8 (33%) Minimal Response (MR) 7 (20%)  Stable Disease (SD) 6 (23%)  Progression (PD) 2 (7%)  Response: n = 30 . n (%) . ORR (\u2265PR) . Near Complete Response (nCR) 4 (7%) 15 (50%) Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) 3 (10%) Partial Response (PR) 8 (33%) Minimal Response (MR) 7 (20%)  Stable Disease (SD) 6 (23%)  Progression (PD) 2 (7%)  View Large Median progression-free survival (PFS) for all pts was 10.8 mos (CI: 4.6, 27.7) and 7 pts have not progressed. The median overall survival (OS) was 30.6 mos (CI: 16.7, NR) with 15/30 pts still alive. Of the 8 thalidomide nai\u0308ve pts, 4 have progressed with a median projected PFS of 30 mos and all 8 pts remain alive (range 28 \u2013 43 mos). Conclusions: Pts have tolerated Peri + Rev + Dex well with manageable toxicity, and with promising clinical activity demonstrated by an ORR (\u2265 PR) of 50%, an extended PFS and OS. Given that most pts were exposed to Thal/Dex with more than half refractory to a prior Thal/Dex regimen, the encouraging response rates and survival appear to suggest benefit with the addition of perifosine to Rev/Dex. This data thus warrants further study, including a potential randomized trial to confirm the activity of perifosine added to Rev/Dex. A randomized phase III trial of Peri/Vel/Dex vs. Vel/Dex is underway for previously Vel exposed MM patients.
