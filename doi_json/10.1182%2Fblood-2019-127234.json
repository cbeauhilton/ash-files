    "abstract_text": "Background : Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is common malignancy in Western countries. However, little known about this disease entity in our area. This study exploring the biology in out patients' population. Method: Patients with confirmed CLL under IGHV and TP53 mutational analysis at presentation or during follow up. We also integrated other clinical and biological parameter in this study. Results: A total of 137 cases were analyzed, median age 61 years (range:34-89); 30% of the cases age was<55 years at presentation. There was 108 males vs. 29 females M:F ratio 3.7. Two patients gave a family history of CLL, while 1 patient gave a history of other lymphoproliferative disorders. Binet staging system available in 134 cases, A: 109 (81.3%), B: 12 (9%), C:13 (9.7%). B2 macroglobulin elevated in 40/112 (36%) cases and 10/103 (10%) had M-spike. CD38 positivity reported in 37/112 (33%) of cases. Cytogenetics data evaluable in 85 cases: isolated del(13q): 35%, isolated trisomy 12 (16.5%), del(11q) (4.5%), del(17p)(2.4%). IGHV mutational status mutated vs unmutated: 40% vs 60%. Cases with available treatment information on 132 cases. Fifty cases required treatment due to disease progression. First line treatment Bendamustine-Rituximab (BR) 3 cases, Fludarabine Cyclophosphamide Rituximab (FCR) 30 cases and Chlorambucil with anti-CD 20 antibody 6 cases. At the time of review, 3 cases on ibrutinib (2 in 3 rd line and 1 case in the 4 th line). Conclusion: This is the first study to shed light on CLL in our area. There are biological differences between our patients' population and the western countries.
