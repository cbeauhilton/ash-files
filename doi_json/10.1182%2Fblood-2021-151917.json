    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic malignancy with poor prognosis for which the standard-of-care chemotherapy treatment regimen has remained virtually unchanged over the past 40 years. We have employed \"Image-Seq\", a new technology that was developed in our laboratory, to study spatial variations in early leukemia progression in a mouse model of HoxA9-Meis1 AML. We visualized leukemia cells with differing proliferative phenotype using intravital microscopy, captured these cells under image guidance from individual bone marrow microenvironments and studied their differential expression by single-cell RNA sequencing. This analysis identified DPP4 as a key upregulated gene in AML cells from more proliferative bone marrow compartments and associated DPP4 expression with a cell cluster enriched in progenitor cell markers for HoxA9-Meis1 AML, including Flt3, Itgb7 and Ddx4. Strikingly, DPP4 is not expressed in vitro, and its expression in vivo (as quantitated by FACS analysis) correlated with disease progression and marked a more proliferative phenotype both at the 1-week and 2-week time-points during disease progression.
