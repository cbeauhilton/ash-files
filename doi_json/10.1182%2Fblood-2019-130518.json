    "abstract_text": "The current paradigms of known peripheral immune abnormalities in B-Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) are not able to consistently explain patient complications and it is difficult to correct a given CLL patient's immune status. Here, we expand on our initial report demonstrating bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic dysfunction in untreated CLL patients (Manso et al., Leukemia volume 33, pages 638-652, 2019). CLL patient BM had significantly reduced frequencies and short-term functional capacity of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Additionally, the remaining progenitors exhibited increased protein levels of the key hematopoietic transcriptional regulators GATA-2 and PU.1. We further evaluated the frequency and function of myeloid stem cells from controls and untreated CLL patients by limiting dilution analysis in long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) assays. Over the 5 week duration of the assay, we observed delayed and partial recovery of myelopoiesis from CLL-derived HSPCs (Figure 1A). These data suggest that removal of HSPCs from the CLL leukemic microenvironment partially recovers their ability to sustain myelopoiesis. A known inflammatory mediator and hematopoiesis-modulating cytokine that is constitutively produced by CLL cells, TNF-\u03b1, induced increased expression of GATA-2 and PU.1 in specific HSPC subsets and reduced formation of short-term colony forming units in vitro . Addition of TNF-\u03b1 to LTC-IC assays resulted in a striking ablation of myelopoiesis in a dose-dependent manner, partially reproducing the ex vivo results (Figure 1B). To further assess the direct impact of CLL cells on HSPC biology, isolated HSPCs from controls were exposed in vitro to leukemic CLL cells. The co-culture induced overexpression of GATA-2 and PU.1 in distinct HSPC populations, recapitulating our ex vivo findings (Figure 1C-D). When cell-cell contact was inhibited by use of Transwell inserts, an intermediate increase in GATA-2 and PU.1 was observed, highlighting the contributions of both soluble mediators and cell-cell contact to HSPC alterations. In both direct and Transwell co-culture conditions, overexpression of GATA-2 and PU.1 was reversed when TNF-\u03b1 was neutralized (Figure 1E-F). Taken together, these findings indicate a significant role for CLL-derived TNF-\u03b1 in HSPC modulation and expand our previous observations of BM dysfunction in untreated CLL patients. This data offers new molecular insight into the contribution of the leukemic microenvironment to altered hematopoiesis, contributing to immunodeficiency in CLL, and identifies TNF-\u03b1 as a potential therapeutic target for correction of hematopoiesis in CLL disease.
