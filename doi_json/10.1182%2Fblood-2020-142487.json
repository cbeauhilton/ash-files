    "abstract_text": "Introduction Primary or secondary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma is a rare and aggressive disease. Prior database analyses have enriched our knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical presentation and prognosis for these patients, although data regarding treatment patterns and long-term survival data is lacking. Ours is the first study investigating epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns and potential prognostic factors using the Texas Cancer Registry (TCR). This is a statewide database, population-based registry that serves as the foundation for measuring the cancer burden in Texas and it is one of largest cancer registries in the United States 1 . Methods We used the TCR database to retrospectively identify patients diagnosed with CNS lymphoma from 1997 to 2017. Data collected included age, race, histology (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma), location and outcomes (alive/dead). Treatment (chemotherapy, radiation therapy or both) data was collected from 2004 to 2017. Differences in patient-level characteristics between cohorts were compared using a chi-square test and Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests were used to compare survival distributions. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analysis. Results There were 1134 patients with CNS lymphoma identified between 1995 and 2017. Most of them were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (97.4%); only 22 patients had T cell lymphoma. The most common locations were brain (73.9%), unspecified (14.1%) and spinal cord (6.7%). Almost 50% of all patients were over 65 years old; male to female ratio was 1.23. Patients were frequently reported to be Caucasian (62.7%) followed by Hispanic (27.0%) and African-american (6.9%). The median follow-up time was 11 months. Treatment data was available for 485 patients. They either received chemotherapy (58.1%), radiation (9.7%) or both (12.8%). Survival was better for patients receiving chemotherapy and radiation than radiation alone (HR 1.8, p=0.02) or no treatment (HR 3.3, p < 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference when compared with chemotherapy alone (HR 1.4, p= 0.0931) (Figure 1). Overall survival (OS) for patients with DLBCL at 5-years was 27.4 % (95% CI: 24.7%, 30.1%) and 42.0% for T-cell (95% CI: 23.9%, 59.0%). Five-year disease specific survival (DSS) was similar at 39.2% (95% CI: 35.9%, 42.5%) for DLBCL and 51.8% for T-cell lymphoma (95% CI: 30.3%, 69.5%). There was no statistically significant difference between these two cohorts for OS (p = 0.5063) and DSS (p=0.2819). Age over 65 years was associated with poor survival (32 months vs 6 months, p<0.0001). Spinal cord involvement was associated with a better prognosis than other nervous system, cerebellum, or brain (34 months vs 21 months vs 9 months vs 10 months, p < 0.0001) (Figure 2). Conclusion CNS lymphoma is a rare lymphoma presentation. Most of them are DLBCL and commonly found in patients older than 65 years old. Spinal cord disease alone was associated with a better prognosis and age over 65 years old was associated with a worse outcome. Treatment with chemotherapy (either with radiation or alone) is associated with better outcomes. 1.
