    "abstract_text": "Background: Treatment of primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) with a combined systemic and intraventricular chemotherapy (Bonn protocol) has achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 84% and long term complete remissions in a substantial fraction of patients younger than 60 years. Purpose: Due to a high infection rate of the Ommaya reservoir the question was addressed if intraventricular treatment is dispensable in this polychemotherapy protocol. Patients and Methods: Fifty patients with histologically confirmed PCNSL were enrolled onto a phase II-study evaluating chemotherapy without radiotherapy and without intraventricular treatment. A high-dose methotrexate (MTX) (cycles 1,2,4,5) and cytarabine (ara-C) (cycles 3,6) based systemic therapy (including dexamethasone, vinca-alkaloids, ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide) was administered. Results: In an ongoing trial thirty-five of 50 patients (18 pat. < 60 years, 17 pat. over 60 years) are yet assessable for response after a median follow up of nine months (range: 1 to 26 months). In 18 patients < 60 years, the ORR was 78%. However, median time to treatment failure (TTF) was eight months, and median progression free survival (PFS) only 7 months according to frequent early relapses. Conclusions: Early relapses are frequent in younger patients treated with the modified Bonn protocol without intraventricular treatment despite a high ORR. These preliminary results support the assumption that intraventricular treatment is essential to achieve sustained remissions after successful treatment of PCNSL."
