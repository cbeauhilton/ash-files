    "abstract_text": "Outcome results in AML are a continued challenge for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. C-28 methyl ester of 2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolen-1,9-dien-28-oic acid, CDDO-Me, a novel triterpenoid, induces apoptosis in myeloid and lymphoid leukemic cell lines and in primary AML samples in sub-micromolar concentrations. We reported previously that CDDO-Me inhibits the activation of ERK1/2, blocks Bcl-2 phosphorylation, and promoted apoptosis in AML-derived U937 cells (Blood 2002, 99(1):326\u201335). Here, we examined the effects of CDDO-Me on CD34 + AML progenitor cells in vitro . Exposure to 1\u03bcM CDDO-Me induced apoptosis in all but one AML sample (46\u00b14% annexin(+) CD34 + cells, n=20). To assess the anti-leukemia activity of CDDO-Me in vivo , scid mice intravenously injected with U937 cells were treated with liposomally-delivered CDDO-Me (20mg/kg/day IV every other day, starting at day 7, for a total of 9 injections). While CDDO-Me was not toxic to the mice, pathological and flow cytometry analysis revealed reduced (55\u201386%) leukemia burden in the bone marrow, liver, and spleen of mice. Since we had shown that CDDO-Me inhibits phosphorylation of pERK in U937 cells, a further goal of this study was to assess the role of ERK in CDDO-Me-induced cell death in primary AML samples. ERK was expressed and phosphorylated in all (n=15) patients\u2019 samples studied. CDDO-Me inhibited ERK phosphorylation in 9 of 15 patient samples and promoted apoptosis. However, CDDO-Me still induced apoptosis in 5/6 samples that displayed no significant changes in pERK levels in response to the drug. This finding suggests that ERK is not the sole target of the compound. The stress-activated protein kinases JNK and p38 are related to ERK but in general activate pathways that are opposed to ERK. By Western blot analysis, CDDO-Me induced early (30 min) phosphorylation of JNK and p38, which preceded induction of cell death. Pre-treatment of U937 cells with JNK and p38 inhibitors SP600125 and SB203580 partially abrogated induction of apoptosis, while MEK inhibitor PD-98059 significantly enhanced cytotoxicity. CDDO-Me induced p38 phosphorylation in 5 of 6 primary AML samples tested. Collectively, these finding indicate that CDDO-Me markedly shifts signaling toward the JNK and p38 MAPK stress-related pathways and away from the cytoprotective MAPK cascade. In summary, the triterpenoid CDDO-Me is a potent inducer of apoptosis in primary AML including CD34 + AML progenitor cells. Induction of apoptosis is in part mediated via inhibition of ERK signaling combined with JNK/p38 activation. These studies in primary AML samples and the anti-leukemia activity of the compound in vivo suggest potential utility of CDDO-Me for the treatment of AML patients.",
