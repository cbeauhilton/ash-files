    "abstract_text": "von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a large adhesive glycoprotein synthesized in megakaryocytes and endothelial cells and stored in platelet a-granules and Weibel-Palade bodies respectively. It protects Factor VIII (FVIII) from proteolysis and mediates the initial contact of platelets with the injured vessel wall thus playing an important role in hemostasis and thrombosis. VWF is crucial for the formation of occlusive thrombi at arterial shear rates. However, with only a few conflicting studies published, the role of VWF in venous thrombosis is still unclear. Therefore in order to understand the in vivo role of VWF and FVIII in experimental thrombosis under venous flow conditions, we decided to evaluate thrombosis in VWF \u2212/\u2212, FVIII \u2212/\u2212 and transgenic mice lacking the GPIb\u03b1 extracellular domain which was replaced by human Interleukin-4 receptor (IL4R\u03b1/GPIb\u03b1-tg). In ferric chloride-injured veins, platelet adhesion to subendothelium is decreased and thrombus growth is impaired in the VWF \u2212/\u2212 mice when compared to wild-type (WT). In the WT mice, thrombi grew to occlusive size with a mean time of 18 min and all injured venules occluded, whereas in VWF \u2212/\u2212 mice none of the vessels occluded by 40 min after injury, when observation was terminated. Venules of mice deficient in FVIII treated similarly also did not occlude because of embolization. The infusion of recombinant human-FVIII (r-hu-FVIII) in FVIII \u2212/\u2212 mice normalized the occlusion time to WT values. We also observed thrombus instability in the VWF \u2212/\u2212 mice, which was due to lower FVIII levels in these mice since r-huFVIII restored thrombus stability i.e. prevented breaking of the thrombi with large platelet aggregates moving downstream. Despite normalization of blood clotting time and thrombus stability after r-FVIII infusion, the VWF \u2212/\u2212 thrombi grew at a slower rate than WT and the venules did not occlude. In transgenic mice lacking the GPIb\u03b1 extracellular domain, all injured venules occluded. Thus, VWF uses other adhesion receptors besides GPIb\u03b1 in thrombus growth under venous shear conditions. Our studies document crucial independent roles for VWF and FVIII in experimental thrombosis under venous flow conditions in vivo .",
