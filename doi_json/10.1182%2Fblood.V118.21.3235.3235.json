    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3235 T cell development relies on the interaction between the T-cell receptor (TCR) on thymocytes and the self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expressed on thymic epithelial cells in the thymus. This process, called positive selection, rescues developing thymocytes from cell death while leading to their differentiation into mature T cells. Since it is believed that the proper development of CD8 T cells requires an intact thymus, several groups studied their development using fetal or reaggregation thymus organ cultures in vitro . Unfortunately, these models were shown to be cumbersome requiring a complicated set-up while generating limited cellular yield. Thus, we sought of developing a novel in vitro system using bone marrow-derived stromal cells to support CD8 T cell development and maturation in vitro . We selected the OTI system as a working model due to the availability of previously identified positively selecting peptides. Non-selected T-cell-committed double-positive (DP) OTI thymocytes (CD4 + CD8 + CD69 \u2212 ) were first fractionated based on the surface expression intensity of both TCR and CD5. These 3 subsets designated as TCR lo CD5 lo (DP1), TCR int CD5 hi (DP2), and TCR hi CD5 int (DP3) express different levels of ZAP70. Following fractionation, the DP subsets were co-cultured with bone marrow-derived stromal cells presenting OTI-selecting peptides. In the absence of cytokines, no CD8 + OTI cell development occurred in vitro . When repeated in the presence of \u03b3c-cytokines (IL2, IL4, IL7, IL9, IL15 and IL21) only rIL4 and rIL7 were able to induce CD8 T cell development. Supplementing the co-culture system with rIL4 led to the generation of 50\u201360% single-positive (SP) CD8 T cells only from the DP3 fraction whereas rIL7 induced the development of a minor fraction of CD8 T cells from DP2s (3\u20134%) and a major population from DP3 (50\u201376%). Furthermore, we found that rIL4 treatment triggers the development of 2 distinct populations of SP OTI cells (based on their CD8 expression intensity) which we termed CD8 int and CD8 hi . When analyzed by flow-cytometry, ex vivo generated CD8 int , but not CD8 hi , expressed high levels of CD69, PD-L1 and CD44. In contrast, SP CD8 T cells developed in the presence of rIL7 did not upregulate these markers. Since IL7 promotes survival and proliferation of TCR-triggered DPs while IL4 affects their differentiation, we admixed both cytokines during the co-culture and found a dominant rIL4 effect: the phenotype of SP CD8 T cells was similar to that induced by rIL4 alone. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that some DP thymocytes are efficiently selected in our system by OTI-specific positively selecting peptides. Notably, the addition of rIL7 leads to the development and maturation of classic CD8 T cells whereas rIL4 induces both classic and innate CD8 T cells. This work was supported by grant a from CIHR.
