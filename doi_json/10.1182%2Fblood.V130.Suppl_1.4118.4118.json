    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Approximately 40% of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who receive standard therapy relapse or develop refractory disease, have poor clinical outcomes (median overall survival of 6 months) with subsequent salvage therapies (Sehn LH. Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program. 2012; Crump, et al. ASCO 2016). The novel cereblon modulating agent CC-122 promotes ubiquitination and degradation of hematopoietic transcription factors Ikaros and Aiolos in a cereblon-dependent manner, resulting in both DLBCL cell autonomous activity as well as immunostimulatory effects. CC-122 induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradation leads to increased apoptosis in both activated B-cell (ABC) and germinal center B-cell (GCB) DLBCL cell lines, in contrast to the ABC subtype selectivity of lenalidomide (Hagner P et al. Blood. 2015). The maximum tolerated dose of CC-122, active ingredient in capsule (AIC) was established for continuous oral dosing at 3 mg AIC daily (QD) in multi-tumor cohorts (Gandhi A, et al. Blood. 2013). Subsequently, intermittent dosing schedules were evaluated in lymphoma; 4 mg AIC taken 5 out of 7 days (5/7) was chosen for further expansion (Carpio C, et al. Blood 2015 126:1494). Finally, a formulated capsule was introduced, CC-122 (F6); the recommended phase II dose was chosen based on pharmacokinetics and tolerability (3 mg, 5/7). Methods : Subjects received oral doses of CC-122 AIC on continuous (28/28) or intermittent (21/28 or 5/7) schedules, or CC-122 F6 on the 5/7 schedule. Key inclusion criteria include age \u226518 years, and relapsed or refractory disease, defined as progression following (or unable to tolerate) \u22651 prior anthracycline or alkylating agent containing regimen (with or without anti-CD20). Adverse events (AE) were evaluated per NCI CTCAE v4.03 and efficacy by 2007 IWG Criteria. DLBCL cell-of-origin and a novel gene expression classifier representing tumor microenvironment content were tested using NanoString on tumor biopsies and correlated to efficacy. Results:As of May 1, 2017, 97 R/R DLBCL subjects from 18 institutions were enrolled/treated; 81 were enrolled at doses/schedules selected for expansion (3 mg QD AIC n=24, 4 mg 5/7 AIC n=39, and 3 mg F6 5/7 n=18), and 16 were enrolled at other dose levels. Eight subjects were ongoing as of the data cutoff date. Twelve subjects had transformed lymphoma (12.4%) and 85 DLBCL, not otherwise specified (NOS) (87.6%). The median age was 62 (36% were >65) and 57% were male, 98% had ECOG 0-1 at screening, 62% were refractory to their last prior therapy (SD/PD), 30% had CR to prior R-CHOP, and 44% had <CR to prior R-CHOP. Median prior lines was 3 (range 1-13), 86% were treated with \u22652 prior lines of therapy. Of the 57 R/R DLBCL subjects enrolled in the 5/7 schedule at doses chosen for expansion, a total of 46 subjects (81%) experienced \u22651 Grade 3-4 treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE), of which 34 (60%) was suspected to be related to CC-122, and serious adverse events (SAE) suspected to be related to CC-122 were reported in 25% of subjects. The most common grade 3-4 TEAEs were neutropenia (39%) and infections (combined term, 17.5%). There was 1 grade 5 event of pneumonia suspected to be related to CC-122. Dose reduction due to AEs (most commonly due to neutropenia) occurred in 12 subjects (21.1%); 40.4% of subjects received at least one dose of G-CSF. Fifty-one subjects (89%) had discontinued treatment as of the data cutoff; the most common reasons for study discontinuation were disease progression (60%), adverse event (16%), death (5%), and candidate for transplant (4%). Pooled efficacy is shown for DLBCL NOS subjects with at least 2 prior lines of therapy treated at doses/schedules of CC-122 selected for expansion. As observed in Table 1, gene classifier positive patients had a better outcome than gene classifier negative patients Conclusions:CC-122 appears well tolerated with encouraging activity in patients with R/R DLBCL. CC-122 has broad activity across cell of origin including in ABC, GCB, and unclassified subsets. Preliminary efficacy data demonstrated differential effects of CC-122 between gene classifier positive and negative subjects. A novel gene expression signature is being established to enrich for responders to CC-122. The observed signals of efficacy are encouraging in this R/R DLBCL subset. CC-122 studies are ongoing both as a single agent and in combination with other anti-lymphoma agents.
