    "abstract_text": "Human B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (BLIMP-1) was originally described as a repressor of the interferon-beta response to viral infection. Subsequently, the murine orthologue was identified as a regulator of plasma cell differentiation. The involvement of BLIMP-1 in hemopoietic differentiation is not restricted to the B-cell lineage as BLIMP-1 is induced during differentiation of myeloid progenitors. During in vitro macrophage and plasma cell differentiation the expression of BLIMP-1 is cytokine driven. However, the BLIMP-1 response to virus infection can be reproduced by transfection with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), indicating that BLIMP-1 is a target of dsRNA responsive signaling pathways. A central regulator of the intracellular response to viral infection is the interferon-inducible double-stranded RNA activated kinase, PKR. PKR belongs to a family of kinases that phosphorylate the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha (eIF2\u03b1) and activate common downstream signaling pathways. PERK, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) PKR-homologue is activated during the unfolded protein response (UPR), a stress response involved in both macrophage activation and terminal B-cell differentiation. This suggested the hypothesis that BLIMP-1 may represent a shared target of signaling pathways in the response to cellular stresses such as virus infection and the UPR. In this study we demonstrate that BLIMP-1 is rapidly upregulated during the UPR in human myeloid and B-cell lines. This response is conserved in primary murine macrophages, in which mimics of physiological stress and classical activation stimuli also induce Blimp-1 . During the UPR, BLIMP-1 mRNA is induced at the level of transcription, with enhanced recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the BLIMP-1 promoter. Furthermore the stress response is limited to induction of BLIMP-1 \u03b1 mRNA and does not affect levels of an alternate transcript encoding a truncated protein, BLIMP-1\u03b2. The common induction of BLIMP-1 mRNA by stimuli which trigger the UPR supports the hypothesis that BLIMP-1 is a target of the eIF2\u03b1 kinase family. To test this hypothesis directly, we employed a dominant negative mutant PERK. Our data demonstrate that the BLIMP-1 response to UPR stress is dependent on an intact PERK signaling pathway. Collectively our results provide evidence for a novel link between cellular stress, the eIF2\u03b1 kinase family and a regulator of differentiation in macrophages and B-cells.",
