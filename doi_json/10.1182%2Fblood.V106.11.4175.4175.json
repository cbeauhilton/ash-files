    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Platelet concentrates (PC) collected by apheresis are effective in supporting deeply thrombocytopenic patients. The reduced risk of multiple allogeneic exposure and transmissible infectious diseases together with the high WBC depletion and diminished transfusion reactions are the main advantages offered by PC transfusion. At moment, the availability of several synthetic solutions for platelets storage permits to prepare hyperconcentrate( dry ) apheresis platelets with the advantage of reducing febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions and, in low body weight patients the citrate toxicity, without the necessity of further manipulations. The aim of this study was to test the quality of 20 dry platelets (DP) in comparison to 20 standard plateletpheresis (SP) concentrates. Materials and methods: A total of 40 apheresis procedures were performed by the single-needle Cobe Trima separation device (Gambro BCT, Lakewood, CO, USA) collecting either DP or SP concentrates. Within 1h after collection, the bag containing DP was added with the appropriate amount (70% of DP final volume) of synthetic solution for platelets storage (SSP, MacoPharma). Both DP and SP concentrates were stored at room temperature with gentle agitation for 4 days. For both concentrates, platelet yield was calculated and in vitro studies of membrane glycoproteins expression and aggregation at day +1 and day +4 were carried out. Results: The comparison between 20 DP and 20 SP concentrates in terms of ability to aggregate in vitro and membrane glycoproteins expression at day +1 and day +4 of storage is reported in table A and B respectively. Conclusions: The in vitro tests documented a major activation of dry platelets. In particular, the ability to aggregate was reduced in the 20 DP concentrates analised and this phenomenon was more evident at day +4 of storage. The alteration of membrane glycoproteins expression (markers of storage lesion) confirms the lower in vitro quality of DP concentrates. The effectiveness of this new blood component in vivo should be evaluated in a controlled clinical trial. Table A.  At collection . Day +1 . Day +4 . SP . DP . SP . DP . SP . DP .
