    "abstract_text": "Background: follicular lymphoma (FL) is histologically subdivided into grades 1/2(FL1/2), 3A(FL3A), and 3B(FL3B). FL3B is more like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), while the clinical approach to FL1/2 and FL3A has been debated. We aim to explore the clinical, biological characteristics and outcomes between them. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 195 de novo FL patients within the same time frame (1999 to 2020) was identified. 141 patients were FL1/2, and 54 patients were FL3A. Results: Comparing with FL1/2, FL3A patients tend to present ECOG\u22651, B symptoms, bone marrow involvement, digestive tract involvement, elevated LDH, Ki-67\u226530%, CD10 negative, and multiple myeloma oncogene-1(MUM1) positive, while Ann Arbor stage I or II was usually seen in FL1/2. After received CHOP\u00b1R (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone \u00b1rituximab), the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 89.5% for FL1/2 and 61.1% for FL3A [ HR =3.742(95%CI:1.838-7.620),P <0.0001], the 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 62.5 for FL1/2 and 47.6% for FL3A [ HR =2.113(95%CI:1.297-3.443),P =0.003]. Conclusion: FL3A is more aggressive both clinically and biologically compared with FL1/2, and more attention should be paid to the difference of treatment between them.
