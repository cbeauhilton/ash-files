    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3568 Introduction: High dose chemotherapy with melphalan followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) is a standard treatment regimen for young patients with multiple myeloma. However, there are few studies, mainly with low patient counts, testing the benefit of the reapplication of high dose chemo therapy in relapsed or refractory myeloma. Methods: Here we retrospectively analyzed 178 patients (56% male, 44% female, median age 60 years) with relapsed or refractory myeloma who were treated by reapplying high dose chemotherapy with melphalan followed by autologous PBSCT in our institution over the last 18 years. The median follow up of this study was 54 months. Result: Median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after relapse autologous transplantation were 16 and 35 months, respectively. 66% of the patients received newer antimyeloma agents for reinduction therapy (39% thalidomide, 6% bortezomib, 21% lenalidomide). In univariate analysis, time between first transplantation and progression of disease had a significant impact on PFS and OS (p=0.001 and p<0.001). Estimated hazard ratio (HR) for prolongation of time to progression (TTP) after first transplantation of one year for PFS and OS are 0.85 and 0.73, respectively. The effect of TTP after first PBSCT on PFS and OS with respect to different clinically relevant cutoff values is illustrated in Table 1 .
