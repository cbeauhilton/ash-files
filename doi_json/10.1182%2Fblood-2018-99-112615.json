    "abstract_text": "Background: Flotetuzumab (FLZ; MGD006/S80880) is a novel CD123 x CD3 bispecific DART\u00ae protein being tested in a Phase 1/2 study (NCT02152956) in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). As with all T-cell redirecting therapies, cytokine secretion, inherent in T-cell activation, with ensuing potential for cytokine release syndrome (CRS), remains an important side effect. We have previously reported that multi-step dosing mitigates CRS severity (1). CRS diagnosis and treatment is guided by the occurrence of non-specific clinical signs, such as fever, chills, hypotension and tachycardia. Therefore, identification of predictors of CRS will be useful for optimal pt. management. Here we report on potential biomarkers of CRS severity that may help guide CRS management. Methods: Data from pts treated with FLZ at RP2D (lead-in dose of 30ng/kg/d for 3d, 100ng/kg/d for 4d for week 1 followed by 500ng/kg/d CIV week 2-4 of cycle 1, and a 4d-on/3d-off schedule for Cycle 2 and beyond in 28-day cycles) was collected and analyzed. Incidence and severity of CRS were analyzed for correlation with cytokine levels and changes in BM blasts. Relation between immune cells (T-cell subsets, monocytes) with tumor burden, percent CD123+ AML blasts, and CD123 expression, were interrogated as potential determinants of CRS. Administration, dose and frequency of tocilizumab (TCZ), an IL-6 receptor antagonist, were evaluated for their relationship with CRS severity, frequency, CRP and cytokine levels. Results: 30 pts were dosed at RP2D. Most pts experienced mild to moderate CRS (G1 26.7%, G2 60%) of short duration (median 1 day(d), range 1-26 d) and were conservatively managed to full resolution. Grade \u2265 3 events occurred in 4/30 pts (13%), with vasopressors use in 2 pts, and a median duration of 2.5 d (range 2-13 d). CRS frequency decreased with time on treatment: 42% occurred within the first week (LID), 39.6% occurring in week 2 (step up to 500ng/kg/day) and 18% occurring during week 3 and 4. IL-6 levels showed the best relationship with CRS severity, as previously shown (1). IL-6 levels, however, did not correlate with response. Twenty pts (67%) received at least one dose of TCZ (median 2 doses/pt; range 1-12 doses). As anticipated, mean IL-6 levels increased after administration of TCZ. CRS severity showed a relationship with the baseline frequency of circulating CD4+ cells (median 47% in G1 vs 73% in G \u22652, p = 0.0082), while CD8+ cell frequency did not correlate with CRS. Disease burden (absolute AML blasts, % CD123 AML blasts), CD123 expression on AML blasts, monocytes levels or effector-to-target ratio in the peripheral blood did not show a relationship with CRS severity. Importantly, CRS severity was not correlated with FLZ anti-leukemic activity. Conclusion: The frequency of CD4+ cells at baseline may be a potential biomarker for identifying pts at risk of more severe CRS. Early use of TCZ can effectively modify the activity of IL-6, a significant contributor to CRS, and blunt CRS severity. Since severity of CRS and IL-6 levels did not correlate with FLZ anti-leukemic activity, blunting its severity should be aggressively pursued. Early identification of pts at greater CRS risk together with multistep dosing (1) and early use of TCZ can effectively manage CRS with no impact on FLZ anti-leukemic activity. Jacobs et al.
