    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4623 Recently, clinical importance of disease status by computed tomography (CT) before treatment in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is increasing. The present study was conducted to evaluate whether splenic volume (SV) by CT would predict the clinical outcome in CLL patients. SV were measured in 61 Rai II-IV CLL patients who underwent CT scan before chlorambucil therapy. SV was reconstructed and measured from the cross-sectional CT images by using 3 dimensional Voxar analytical volume software. Median SV was 721.3 cm 3 (223.7-3576.6 cm 3 ) is the most significant separated cut-off point on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Low SV group was associated with longer PFS and OS than high SV group ( p <0.001; p <0.001). High SV (SV \u2265 721.3 cm 3 ) was associated with higher Rai stage (SV between Rai II and III, p =0.005; Rai III and IV, p =0.026) and poorer response (SV between CR and PR, p =0.075; PR and SD, p =0.366; SD and PD, p =0.019). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that high SV was independent prognostic factor on PFS (HR, 2.924; 95%CI, 1.308\u20136.538; p =0.009) and OS (HR, 3.024; 95%CI, 1.106\u20138.270; p =0.031). SV before therapy reflected the clinical outcome in CLL patients. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
