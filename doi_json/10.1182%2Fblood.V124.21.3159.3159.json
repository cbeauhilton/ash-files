    "abstract_text": "Background: Second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (2G-TKIs) are more potent than imatinib against chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) as a first-line therapy, and the majority of patients (pts) on 2G-TKIs could achieve favorable molecular responces over MR 3.0 by 24 M (Saglio G, et al. Blood 2011, Kantarjian HM, et al. Blood 2012). It is also likey that molecular response at 3 M will predict outcome for CML-CP pts on imatinib. Furthermore, Mustjoki S, et al. showed that Ph+ stem cell burden at diagnosis is a prognostic marker of molecular responses at 3-9 M on dasatinib or imatinib (Leukemia 2013). Thus, early prognostic marker of outcome is feasible for CML-CP on TKIs. Methods: We are conducting a phase II study (N-road) for newly diagnosed CML-CP pts, in which nilotinib 300mg BID is given for 24 M and is to be escalated to 400mg BID if no optimal response at any check points. The primary endpoint is CMR rate by 24 M, and secondary endpoints include MR 3.0 /MR 4.0 by 12 M and exploring prognostic factors. In this setting, the impact of initial Ph+ stem cell burden on clinical findings and therapeutic responses has been investigated in a sub-study. By July 2014, 48 pts were enrolled and BM CD34+ cell fractions could be evaluated by FACS-FISH analysis at diagnosis in 43 pts, among those 35 pts passed 3 M, 34 pts 6 M and 15 pts 12 M, respectively. Results: MR 3.0 rate was 8/35 at 3M, 23/34 at 6M and 10/15 at 12M. When 43 pts were classified into two groups (higher: H, lower: L) according to the mean CD34+ cell counts at diagnosis (5995/mL of BM aspirates), there were significant differences (p<0.05) in BCR-ABL transcripts indicated as IS (77.66 vs 64.03 %, p=0.030) and WBC count (81.3 vs 22.3 /mL, p=0.012), but no differences in molecular responses at 3, 6 and 12 M between the two groups. There was a positive correlation between CD34+ cell count and WBC count (r=0.328, p=0.035). The median percentage of Ph+ cells, as measured by FISH (~1000 cells analyzed), in CD34+CD38- fraction at diagnosis was 97.1% (range 2-100%) compared to 98.6% (range 28.2-99.8%) in CD34+CD38+ fraction. The proportion of Ph+ cells in CD34+CD38- fraction correlated with PLT count (r=0.394, p=0.014) but inversely with RBC count (r=-0.474, p=0.003), Hb (r=-0.587, p=0.0001) and Ht (r=-0.475, p=0.003), respectively. Between the two groups divided by the median percentage, there were significant differences in RBC count (406 vs 460 x10 4 /mL, p=0.046), Hb (11.7 vs 14.5 g/dL, p=0.009) and Hct (38.8 vs 44.7%, p=0.040). There were no significant differences in molecular responses at any check points. On the other hand, when divided by the mean percentage (81.1%), there was only a significant difference in PLT count (48.1 vs 27.2 /mL, p=0.028). Absolute Ph+ cell counts in CD34+CD38- fraction were estimated in each patient by combining 3 parameters of CD34 cell counts/mL of BM aspirates, proportion of CD38- fraction and percentage of Ph+ cells. Ph+CD34+CD38- cell counts siginificantly correlated with WBC count (r=0.365, p=0.021) and inversely with RBC count (r=-0.361, p=0.002), Hb (r=-0.409, p=0.009) and percentage of lymphocytes (r=-0.339, p=0.032). Between the 2 groups divided by the median cell counts (256/mL), there were significant differences in RBC (406.5 vs 472.0 x10 4 /mL, p=0.005), Hb (11.8 vs 14.3 g/dL, p=0.004), Hct (39.0 vs 44.6 %, p=0.024). Although we could not find significant difference in molecular responses at any check points, patients with lower number of Ph+CD34+CD38- cells tend to achieve MR 3.0 faster than those with higher number of cells (p=0.059) ( Figure 1 ). When divided by the mean cell counts (578/mL), there was a significant difference in WBC count (94.45 vs 22.44 /mL, p=0.016). Conclusion: increased Ph+ stem cell burden apparently affects the level of leukocytosis and anemia at diagnosis, but not MR 3.0 /MR 4.0 rate by 12 M on nilotinib, although it is likely to extend time to achieve MR 3.0 .
