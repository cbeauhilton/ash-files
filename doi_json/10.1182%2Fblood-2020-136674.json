    "abstract_text": "Introduction Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has been extremely efficacious in pediatric patients with multiply relapsed and/or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with overall remission rates of 81% by three months post-infusion (Maude et al., N Engl J Med , 2018), and achieved FDA approval for this indication. In order for the product to meet the standards of this approval for commercial release, both the leukapheresis and manufactured products must meet a variety of specific requirements, some of which are more stringent than those in these pivotal clinical trials. The Managed Access Program (MAP) provides access to tisagenlecleucel for patients with B-ALL or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that is out of specification (OOS) for whom repeat leukapheresis is not feasible. Patients may also receive OOS tisagenlecleucel by applying for a single-patient Investigational New Drug (IND). Previous reports have shown no difference in efficacy or toxicity between patients receiving tisagenlecleucel that meets commercial release specifications and those receiving OOS tisagenlecleucel (Grupp, et al., Blood Abstr 614, 2019; Jaglowski, et al., Blood Abstr 627, 2019). This study seeks to evaluate outcomes in pediatric and young adult patients who received tisagenlecleucel via the MAP or a single-patient IND in our Pediatric Real World CAR Consortium (PRWCC). Methods Retrospective data were abstracted from the PRWCC database of patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL from fifteen different US institutions who received tisagenlecleucel as an FDA-approved therapy outside the context of a clinical trial. Patients whose cellular product was obtained through the MAP (NCT03601442) or with single patient IND approval due having either a cryopreserved leukapheresis product and/or manufactured tisagenlecleucel that did not meet specifications for commercial release were categorized as MAP/IND and those whose product met all release criteria were categorized as standard of care (SOC). Results Among 185 total infused patients in our database, 24 (13%) received tisagenlecleucel either via the MAP (n=14) or a single patient IND (n=10). Baseline patient and disease characteristics were not significantly different for MAP/IND patients versus the SOC cohorts (Table 1). Median duration of follow-up post-CAR T cell infusion for these infused patients was 342.5 days (range 107-780) versus 318 days (range 6-863) for the SOC cohort (p=0.43). Reasons for products being OOS included cell viability <80% (n=17), total nucleated cell count <2x10 9 in leukapheresis product (n=3), failed interferon gamma release assay (n=2), cryopreserved leukapheresis product collected >9 months prior (n=1), and determination of residual beads >50 beads/3x10 6 cells (n=1). Overall survival at 6- and 12-months was 96% versus 83% and 85% versus 70% for the MAP/IND versus SOC, respectively. Event-free survival at 6- and 12-months was 65% versus 63% and 55% versus 51%, respectively. Probability of continued remission at 6- and 12-months among patients who achieved a complete remission (CR) at day 28 was 79% versus 75% and 66% versus 63% for the MAP/IND versus SOC, respectively (Figure 1). Comparing toxicities between patients in the MAP/IND versus SOC cohorts, cytokine release syndrome (CRS, any grade) occurred in 46% versus 61%, CRS (>grade 3) in 17% versus 19%, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) in 8% versus 22%, and infectious complications in 54% vs. 37%, respectively (p=ns for all). Conclusions In our retrospective cohort evaluating the use of tisagenlecleucel to treat pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL in the real-world setting, neither the efficacy nor safety of tisagenlecleucel seem to be compromised by use of products OOS for commercial release. Larger studies are needed to further delineate specific cut-offs outside of which either efficacy and/or safety may truly be impacted.
