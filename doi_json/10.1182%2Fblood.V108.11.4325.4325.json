    "abstract_text": "Activating mutations at codon 617 of the Janus-2 tyrosine kinase (JAK2 V617F) have recently been described in hematological malignancies. In adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the reported frequencies vary, and JAK2 V617F mutations have mainly been detected in secondary AML following a myeloproliferative disorder. In adult de novo AML, the mutation was less frequent, and detected in 2/11 (18%) acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (FAB M7) samples (Jelinek et al., Blood 2005), and occasionally in other FAB-types. This prompted us to analyze a cohort of pediatric AML FAB M7 samples for this particular mutation. In children, at least 3 different subsets of AML M7 can be identified: infants with AML M7 characterized by t(1;22)(p13;q13), older children with random cytogenetic aberrations, and myeloid leukemia of Down syndrome (DS ML). DS ML is often preceded by transient myeloproliferative disease (TMD), hence we also screened TMD samples to detect whether JAK2 V617F mutations would be involved in clonal evolution from TMD to DS ML. To exclude germ-line mutations in DS, we tested normal mononuclear bone marrow cells (NBMC) from children with DS. These NBMC were obtained from a sternal aspirate from children undergoing cardiac surgery, after informed consent was obtained. Genomic DNA was harvested from leukemic cells, and JAK2 exon 12, including the intron-flanking regions, was amplified and sequenced to screen for the JAK2 V617F mutation. As a positive control for the JAK2 V617F mutation, we used HEL 92.1.7 cells (an erythroleukemic cell line). In a dilution experiment we could still detect the mutation, using direct sequencing, if 10% HEL/JAK2 mutated cells were mixed with 90% wild-type control cells. We tested 49 samples, comprising of 9 NBMC, 11 TMD, 14 DS-ML M7, 11 non-DS AML M7 and 4 relapsed non-DS AML M7 samples (including 2 initial diagnosis-relapse pairs). The median age of the TMD cohort was 3 days, for DS-ML children 1.9 years (range 0.9\u20133.8 yrs), and for non-DS AML 1.5 years (range 1.2\u201313.7 yrs). The median white blood cell count for TMD was 25.8x10 9 /l, for DS-ML 13.8x10 9 /l, and for non-DS AML 12.4x10 9 /l. Cytogenetic data were available in 5/11 non-DS AML cases only, which showed no cases with a t(1;22). No JAK2 V617F mutations were detected in any of the clinical samples. We conclude that the role of JAK2 V617F mutations in pediatric DS and non-DS acute megakaryoblastic leukemia is limited at best. However, we were not able to screen the subgroup of non-DS AML cases with t(1;22).",
