The integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 has been shown to primarily mediate platelet-fibrin interactions, but the mechanism of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 binding to fibrin is largely unknown and may be significantly different from binding to fibrinogen. To elucidate mechanisms of platelet interactions with fibrin, we have compared the overall reactivity, binding strength, and specificity towards \u03b1IIb\u03b23 of human fibrinogen vs. monomeric fibrin, using single-molecule optical trap-based rupture force spectroscopy of the surface-bound proteins. In this system, a ligand-coated bead is trapped by the laser and repeatedly brought into contact with a receptor-coated surface so that the forces required to separate the two can be measured and displayed as rupture force histograms. We have applied this technique to the interaction of fibrin(ogen) and \u03b1IIb\u03b23 by measuring the force required to separate a laser-trapped bead coated with either fibrinogen or monomeric fibrin from an immobilized pedestal coated with purified \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Experiments were performed with plasma-purified or recombinant homodimeric \u03b3A/\u03b3A and \u03b3\u2032/\u03b3\u2032 fibrin(ogen)s. The latter protein represents a splicing variant in which the \u03b3 chain has a substitution in the C-terminal four amino acids in 400-411 dodecapeptide, the major \u03b1IIb\u03b23-binding site in fibrinogen. Surface-bound monomeric fibrin was obtained by treating fibrinogen-coated surfaces with thrombin. Control integrin-fibrinogen interactions manifested as a characteristic bimodal rupture force histogram with rupture forces ranging from 20 pN to 140 pN, similar to what we had observed previously (PNAS, 2002, 99, 7426). The interactions were highly sensitive to inhibitory effects of abciximab and eptifibatide, specific \u03b1IIb\u03b23 antagonists, and to Mn 2+ -induced activation, indicating that they were mediated by the functional integrin. Monomeric fibrin \u03b3A/\u03b3A was at least as reactive towards \u03b1IIb\u03b23 as the parental fibrinogen \u03b3A/\u03b3A, sometimes exhibiting even higher binding probabilities and slightly stronger rupture forces. Fibrin-integrin interactions were less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of abciximab compared to fibrinogen, suggesting that some additional structures in \u03b1IIb\u03b23, not completely blocked by this Fab fragment, might be involved in binding to fibrin. Similar to fibrinogen, fibrin-integrin interactions were partially sensitive to eptifibatide, cRGD peptide and \u03b3C-dodecapeptide, indicating that their specificity is akin to fibrinogen but may not be identical. Fibrinogen \u03b3\u2032/\u03b3\u2032, lacking the established binding site for the integrin, was reactive with \u03b1IIb\u03b23, but the binding strength was somewhat smaller. The effect of replacing the \u03b3A with the \u03b3\u2032 chains in fibrinogen was qualitatively similar to competitive inhibition by the \u03b3C-dodecapeptide and resulted in complete cutoff of the larger force peak as well as in partial reduction of weaker interactions. That fibrinogen \u03b3\u2032/\u03b3\u2032 maintained its ability to bind \u03b1IIb\u03b23 suggests that the \u03b3400-411 motif is not the only structure involved in the binding of immobilized fibrinogen to the integrin. Fibrin \u03b3\u2032/\u03b3\u2032 was as reactive with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 as fibrinogen \u03b3\u2032/\u03b3\u2032. Both of them interacted with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in an RGD-sensitive manner. The data show that both surface-bound fibrinogen and monomeric fibrin are highly reactive with the integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Fibrin is somewhat more reactive than fibrinogen in terms of binding probability and strength and is less sensitive to a specific inhibitor, abciximab, suggesting that \u03b1IIb\u03b23-fibrin interactions have distinct specificity. Susceptibility to competitive inhibitors, such as cRGD and \u03b3C-dodecapeptide, along with maintenance of integrin-binding activity of fibrinogen \u03b3\u2032/\u03b3\u2032 suggest that the \u03b1IIb\u03b23-binding sites in fibrin(ogen) are complex and include, but are not confined to, the \u03b3C-terminal 400-411 motif.
