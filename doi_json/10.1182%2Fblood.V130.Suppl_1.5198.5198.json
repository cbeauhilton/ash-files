    "abstract_text": "Fascin is an actin bundling protein used to form cellular projections (e.g. filipodia) involved in cell motility and invasion. Cancer cells often upregulate fascin, and in many cancer types this is associated with poor prognosis, likely due to increased invasive and metastatic potential. We have developed fascin inhibitors that prevent actin bundling and block breast cancer metastasis in mice. Here we explored the potential role of fascin inhibition in lymphoma. We have shown that fascin is upregulated in 44% of canine B-cell (n=62) and 57% of T-cell lymphoma cases (n=28), and that increased fascin expression is correlated with worse overall survival (p=0.03). B-cell lymphoma cases had a median survival time of 388 days while that of T-cell cases was 263 days. We have further shown that a fascin inhibitor, NP-G2-044, kills human and canine diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells in vitro , and in vivo in mice bearing canine DLBCL xenografts, with GI50s ranging from 5 to 200uM. Animal toxicology studies (performed by Charles River Laboratories) show no hematologic or other toxicity in dogs and rats at concentrations up to 1,000 mg/kg/day for 28 days; these doses are much higher than the doses needed to achieve concentrations that kill lymphoma in vivo . Therefore, we are planning clinical studies in pet dogs with lymphoma to establish proof of principle prior to a human clinical trial. Collectively, our results demonstrate that fascin is a potential new therapeutic target in DLBCL.
