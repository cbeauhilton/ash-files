    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4418 Evidence suggests that extracts from mistletoe (Viscum album L.) have anti-cancer effects on many human cancers. Little is known about the relationship between mistletoe extracts and hematological malignancies. In this study, we investigated the effect of abnobaVISCUM O\u0300 Flaxini, a commercially available mistletoe extracts from ash tree, on growth of K562 human chronic leukemic cells. Results of c ell count and DNA fragmentation assays demonstrated that there was strong growth suppression and induction of apoptosis in K562 cells after treatment with abnobaVISCUM O\u0300 Flaxini at 2 mg/ml for 8 h. Western blot and RT-PCR analyses revealed that abnobaVISCUM O\u0300 Flaxini treatment also led to activation of caspase-9 and -3 and PARP cleavage, but had no effect on expression of death receptor (DR)\u22124 and \u22125 in K562 cells. E xpression of Bak and Bax was not changed, but that of Mcl-1 protein was strongly repressed in abnobaVISCUM O\u0300 Flaxini-treated K562 cells. Moreover, while treatment with abnobaVISCUM O\u0300 Flaxini decreased phosphorylation of ERK-1/2 and PKB, it stimulated phosphorylationof JNK-1/2 and p38 MAPK in K562 cells. I mportantly, pharmacological inhibition studies demonstrated that treatment with z-VAD-fmk (a pan-caspase inhibitor), but not SP600125 (a JNK-1/2 inhibitor ) or SB203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor ), suppressed abnobaVISCUM O\u0300 Flaxini -induced loss of survival and apoptosis in K562 cells, and z-VAD-fmk also blocked abnobaVISCUM O\u0300 Flaxini -induced Mcl-1 protein down-regulation. Induction of ER stress was also seen in abnobaVISCUM O\u0300 Flaxini -treated K562 cells, as judged by increased phosphorylation of eIF-2a and expression of GRP78 and CHOP, three known ER stress sensors. Collectively, these findings provide the first evidence of abnobaVISCUM O\u0300 Flaxini -mediated anti-survival and apoptosis inducing effects on K562 cells via activation of caspases, Mcl-1 down-regulation, and triggering ER stress.
