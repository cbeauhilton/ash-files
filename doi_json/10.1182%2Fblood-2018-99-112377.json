    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Ph-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) represent a heterogeneous group of hematological malignancies which differ in various aspects such as clinical manifestation, underlying genetic aberrations, cytomorphological features and life expectancy. However, across all subtypes, patients (pts) with MPN often suffer from severe symptoms, resulting in an impairment of the quality of life (QoL). Methods: The German Study Group for MPN (GSG-MPN) Bioregistry is a non-interventional prospective study including pts of at least 18 years with diagnosis of Ph-negative MPN according to WHO criteria (2008) having provided written informed consent. The Bioregistry study also includes assessment of QoL at baseline and on an annual basis, with all pts completing the standardized MPN-SAF-TSS questionnaire (German version) and an additional item indicating pts' subjective overall QoL on an 11- point Likert scale . Total scores range from 0 to 90 and were calculated if at least 6 items were answered (Emanuel RM et al., J Clin Oncol. 2012; 30 (33): 4098-103.)). Clinical variables, as documented in the registry, included comorbidities, reported symptoms as assessed by the physician, bleeding, and thromboembolic events (TEE). For statistical analysis, standard descriptive methods, Spearman correlation coefficient, Wilcoxon test/Kruskal-Wallis test for significance testing, and Kendall\u00b4s tau-b statistics were used. Results: 1,403 pts who had completed at least six items of the QoL assessment at baseline were included in this analysis. Median age at diagnosis was 58 years (interquartile range [IQR] 22), 98% were Caucasian, 50% were female. 494 pts were diagnosed with essential thrombocythemia (ET, 35%), 444 pts with polycythemia vera (PV, 32%), 302 pts with primary myelofibrosis (PMF, 22%), 83 pts with MPN-unclassifiable (MPNu, 6%), 43 pts with post-ET-myelofibrosis (pET-MF, 3%) and 37 pts with post-PV-myelofibrosis (pPV-MF, 3%). The most common complaint reported via the MPN-SAF-TSS was fatigue, occurring in more than 80% of the pts in all entities except MPNu (77%). More than 50 % of pts in each entity reported to suffer from early satiety, night sweats, concentration problems, or overall impairment of QoL. Table 1 summarizes all 9 symptoms and overall QoL from the questionnaire categorized by entity. Interestingly, the pts suffering from PET-MF reported the highest symptom burden, while PPV-MF pts showed the lowest overall symptom burden (median total QoL score of 23 vs. 16; p=0.01). The strongest correlations among the different symptoms were seen for fatigue and overall QoL (Spearman\u00b4s rho 0.57, p=6 points. The most concordant symptom was night sweats (further details in table 2). Conclusions : Most MPN pts suffer from a significant symptom burden which impairs their QoL. TEE influence fatigue and concentration problems. The perception of symptoms (particularly with respect to fatigue) differs between pts and treating physician which suggests that questionnaires should be used on a routine basis in order to faithfully reflect patient\u00b4s degree of suffering from MPN and/or treatment.
