    "abstract_text": "Platelet recovery following bone marrow transplant and radiochemotherapy is crucial to prevent bleeding complications. Defects in glycosylation have been associated with decrease in blood platelet counts. However, the role of posttranslational modification in platelet production remains elusive. We here investigated the role of \u03b21,4 galactosyltransferase 1 (\u03b24GalT1), the key glycosyltransferase regulating lactosaminoglycan (LacNAc or \u03b2Gal1,4 GlcNAc) expression by adding galactose (Gal) to terminal N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), in platelet production. Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), but not thrombopoietin promotes megakaryocyte (MK) migration towards the bone marrow sinusoids, thereby increasing platelet production. SDF-1 (CXCL12) upregulated LacNAc expression in fetal liver wild type (WT), but not \u03b24galt1-null megakaryocytes (MKs) lacking \u03b24GalT1, suggesting that SDF-1 promotes LacNAc expression in vivo to regulate MK migration and platelet production. In support of this hypothesis, \u03b24galt1-null mice had severe macrothrombocytopenia with increased bone marrow MK numbers, but normal platelet clearance. Ploidy, expression of the major glycoproteins (GPIb\u03b1/V/IX and \u03b1IIb\u03b23) and the surface expression of the SDF-1 receptor CXCR4 were normal in \u03b24galt1-null bone marrow MKs. However, \u03b24galt1-null bone marrow MKs had increased surface and total \u03b21 integrin expression, as determined by flow cytometry, immunoblot and immunofluorescence. Mature CD42b/CD41 positive \u03b24galt1-null MKs co-localized poorly with endoglin positive bone marrow sinusoids (49.9 \u00b1 2.1 %), compared to WT MKs (72.4 \u00b1 0.6 %). Expression of laminin, the major \u03b21 integrin ligand, was upregulated in \u03b24galt1-null MKs, suggesting that loss of LacNAc expression on \u03b21 integrin increased its function. To exclude an extrinsic contribution to the failure of \u03b24galt1-null MKs to migrate, \u03b24galt1-null fetal liver (E14.5) hematopoietic cells (FLHCs) were transplanted in lethally irradiated WT mice. Transplanted \u03b24galt1-null FLHCs restored bone marrow MKs, but failed to migrate to sinusoids and produce circulating platelets. In marked contrast, production of \u03b24galt1-null white blood cells was normal. Together, our results suggest that SDF-1 upregulates \u03b24GalT1-dependent LacNAc expression to promote MK migration and interaction with BM sinusoids, likely regulating MK \u03b21 integrin expression and interaction with components of the extracellular matrix, specifically laminin. Understanding of the mechanisms regulating posttranslational modifications induced by various hematopoietic stimulating chemokines and cytokines will contribute to better platelet recovery following bone marrow transplant and radiochemotherapy.
