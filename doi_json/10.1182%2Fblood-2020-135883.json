    "abstract_text": "Introduction: In PACE (NCT01207440), patients with refractory chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) with substantial prior second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment demonstrated deep, lasting responses to ponatinib. However, long-term follow-up identified rates of arterial occlusive events (AOEs) as a risk. OPTIC (NCT02467270) is a randomized Phase 2 trial evaluating ponatinib at 3 starting doses: 45 mg, 30 mg, and 15 mg daily in patients with CP-CML resistant/intolerant to \u22652 TKIs or with a T315I mutation. The interim analysis showed that the 45-mg (vs 30 mg or 15 mg) starting dose (with reduction to 15 mg upon response) provided the best clinical outcomes and responses were maintained in >75% of patients who dose reduced. Here, we present efficacy and safety outcomes by baseline mutation status and line of treatment for the 3 dose cohorts. Methods: Patients with CP-CML resistant/intolerant to \u22652 TKIs or with T315I mutation were randomized to ponatinib starting doses of 45 mg (Cohort A; 45 mg \u2192 15 mg), 30 mg (B; 30 mg \u2192 15 mg), and 15 mg (C) once daily (qd). Doses were reduced to 15 mg on achievement of \u22641% BCR-ABL1 IS in Cohorts A and B. Doses also could be reduced for safety. The primary endpoint is \u22641% BCR-ABL1 IS at 12 months. In this analysis, the outcome was analyzed by baseline mutation status (none, any, T315I, and non-T315I) and number of prior TKIs (\u22642 or \u22653) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious TEAEs, and AOEs by adjudication were summarized by number of prior TKIs (\u22642 or \u22653). Interim analysis results are descriptive. Results: Patients (N=283) were randomized: A/B/C n=94/95/94; median age was 48 y (18\u201281 y). Seven patients were excluded from the intent-to-treat population (N=276) because they had atypical transcripts. Mutation status was well balanced between cohorts; 59% had no mutation, 41% had \u22651 baseline mutation, 24% had T315I, and 17% had a non-T315I mutation. In all categories of mutation status, the rate of \u22641% BCR-ABL1 IS by 12 months was highest in Cohort A, with the most notable differences seen in patients with T315I (A: 60%, B: 25%, C: 6%) ( Table 1 ). Patients with no mutations or other mutations had smaller differences but the outcomes all still favored 45 mg. Patients in all cohorts were treated with multiple TKIs, with 54% (A), 60% (B), and 53% (C) having 3 or more prior TKIs. The rate of \u22641% BCR-ABL1 IS by 12 months was highest in Cohort A, both in patients treated with \u22642 or \u22653 prior TKIs (43% and 49%, respectively) ( Table 1 ). Table 2 shows rates of TEAEs and TE-AOEs by cohort and number or prior TKIs. There was a trend toward higher event rates in Cohort A and for patients treated with \u22653 TKIs. Rates of adjudicated AOEs were low (\u22646%) in all 3 cohorts irrespective of the number of prior TKIs. Conclusions: At this interim analysis with a median follow-up of ~21 months, the maximum benefit:risk, regardless of mutation status or number of prior TKIs, was observed in patients treated with a 45-mg starting dose, with a reduction to 15 mg upon achievement of response. Patients with the T315I mutation who initiated ponatinib at 45 mg experienced better response rates than those who initiated ponatinib at 30-mg or 15-mg starting doses. Primary analysis will provide a refined understanding of the benefit:risk profile of 3 different starting doses of ponatinib.
