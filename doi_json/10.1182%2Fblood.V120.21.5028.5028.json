    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5028 Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy of the bone marrow caused by the dysregulated proliferation of monoclonal antibody producing plasma cells. A hallmark feature of cancer is the ability to evade cell death signals induced by stress response cues. The Bcl-2 family of proteins regulates the intrinsic apoptosis pathways and consists of pro-apoptotic (Bax, Bak, Bad, Bim, Noxa, Puma) and pro-survival (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1); the balance of which dictates the life or death status of MM tumor cells. Thus, there is a strong rationale to target members of the Bcl-2 proteins for the treatment of MM. ABT-199 is a potent BH3-only mimetic that selectively antagonizes Bcl-2 and is currently in phase I clinical trials for the treatment of hematological malignancies. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of ABT-199 as a single agent and in combination with standard of care drugs such as Velcade (bortezomib) in preclinical models of MM. A panel of 21 human MM cell lines was evaluated in vitro for to sensitivity to ABT-199. ABT-199 potently inhibited cell viability in a sub-set of MM cell lines (7/21) with EC50 values less than 1 \u03bcM. Expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, Bim and other Bcl-2 family proteins were evaluated by protein and mRNA. Cell line modeling identified thresholds for expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 that best predicted sensitivity and resistance to ABT-199 and the dual Bcl-2/Bcl-xL antagonist, navitoclax. Consistent with the target inhibition profile of these drugs, we found that MM lines that were Bcl-2high/Bcl-xLlow/Mcl-1low are the most sensitive to ABT-199 treatment. Whereas cell lines that are Bcl-xLhigh remain sensitive to navitoclax but not ABT-199. MM cell lines that are Mcl-1high are less sensitive to both ABT-199 and navitoclax, suggesting that Mcl-1 is a resistance factor to both drugs. Utilizing a novel Mesoscale Discovery based immunoassay we determined that levels of Bcl-2/Bim complexes also correlated with sensitivity of ABT-199 in the MM cell lines tested. In addition, the t(11;14) status in these cell lines associated with sensitivity to ABT-199. The clinical relevance of the Bcl-2 pro-survival expression pattern in MM cell lines, was determined by a collection of bone marrow biopsies and aspirates (n=27) from MM patients by immunohistochemistry for prevalence of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Similar to our in vitro observations, the majority (75%) of the MM bone marrow biopsies and aspirates had high Bcl-2 levels whereas 50% had high Bcl-xL expression. Therefore, a subset of patient samples (33%) were identified with a favorable biomarker profile (Bcl-2high/Bcl-xLlow) that may predict ABT-199 single agent activity. ABT-199 synergized with bortezomib in decreasing cell viability in the majority of MM cell lines tested in vitro based on the Bliss model of independence analyses (Bliss score range = 10 to 40). However the window of combination activity was reduced due to high degree of sensitivity to bortezomib alone. Therefore, the combination efficacy of ABT-199 and bortezomib was further evaluated in vivo in MM xenograft models that expressed high levels of Bcl-2 protein (OPM-2, KMS-11, RPMI-8226, H929 and MM. 1s). Bortezomib treatment alone at a maximum tolerated dose resulted in tumor regressions or stasis in all xenograft models tested. ABT-199 at a maximum tolerated dose was moderately efficacious (defined by tumor growth delay) as a single agent in xenograft models that expressed high protein levels of Bcl-2 but relatively lower levels of Bcl-xL. However, the combination of ABT-199 with bortezomib significantly increased the overall response rate and durability of anti-tumor activity when compared to bortezomib, resulting in increased cell death in vivo. Treatment with bortezomib increased levels of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein, Noxa, in MM xenograft models that expressed high levels of Mcl-1. Given that the induction of Noxa by bortezomib results in neutralization of Mcl-1 pro-survival activity in MM models [Gomez-Bougie et al; Cancer Res. 67:5418\u201324 (2007)], greater efficacy may be achieved when Bcl-2 is antagonized by ABT-199 thereby inhibiting pro-survival activity occurring through either Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 and increasing cell death. Thus, our preclinical data support the clinical evaluation of ABT-199 in combination with bortezomib in MM patients in which relative expression of the Bcl-2 pro-survival proteins may serve as predictive biomarkers of drug activity.
