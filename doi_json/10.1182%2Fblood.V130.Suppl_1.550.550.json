    "abstract_text": "Integrins are a family of 24 \u03b1/\u03b2 heterodimeric adhesion receptors that transmit bidirectional signals across the cell membrane. Each integrin subunit contains a large extracellular domain composed of headpiece and leg piece, a transmembrane domain and usually a short cytoplasmic tail. The \u03b1 headpiece consists of the common \u03b2-propeller and thigh domains, and an extra \u03b1I domain inserted into the \u03b2-propeller domain in a subset of \u03b1 subunits such as \u03b1L. The \u03b1 leg piece includes calf-1 and -2 domains. The \u03b2 headpiece contains \u03b2I, which is a structural homolog of \u03b1I domain, hybrid, PSI, and I-EGF1 domains. The \u03b2 leg piece contains I-EGF2-4 and \u03b2-tail domains. Structural studies in the last 15 years, largely based on the two \u03b23 integrins, \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1V\u03b23, greatly advanced our understanding of integrin conformational regulation upon activation. The platelet specific \u03b1IIb\u03b23 plays an essential role in hemostasis and thrombosis, while the \u03b1V\u03b23 is important for the growth and survival of many cell types. In the resting state, integrin adopts a bent conformation with the headpiece folded onto the leg piece. Crystallographic and EM studies of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1V\u03b23 revealed two major conformational rearrangements, the swing-out motion of the hybrid domain, resulting in headpiece opening, and the switchblade-like movement of the headpiece from the leg domains, leading to integrin extension and leg separation. Despite the visualization of \u03b23 extension by EM at very low resolution, a high-resolution extended \u03b23 structure has been missing. A Leu33Pro polymorphism at the \u03b23 PSI domain defines the human platelet alloantigen 1 (HPA-1) system. The mismatched HPA-1a/b (Leu33/Pro33) is a major cause of two severe bleeding disorders, fetal/neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) and post-transfusion purpura (PTP) due to the generation of anti-HPA-1 alloantibodies. In addition, it has been controversial whether the Pro33 variant can enhance \u03b23 activity, being a risk factor for thrombosis. It is also unknown whether the Leu33Pro substitution affects the conformation of PSI domain, which undergoes outward movement along with the headpiece opening and extension. It has been difficult to obtain the crystal structure of a full-length extended integrin largely due to the conformational heterogeneity and flexibility, especially in the lower leg domains. In this study, we engineered a chimeric \u03b23 fragment, denoted as c\u03b23-E2, including the domains of PSI, hybrid, I-EGF1, I-EGF2, and the \u03b2I replaced with the \u03b1L \u03b1I domain, which enables the expression of \u03b23 in the absence of \u03b1 subunit. We determined the crystal structures of c\u03b23-E2 in both Leu33 and Pro33 forms. Strikingly, two conformations of c\u03b23-E2, an intermediate state and a fully extended state are simultaneously present in one crystal. The \u03b23 extension occurs at the I-EGF1 and I-EGF2 interface, denoted as \u03b2-knee. Our structure revealed the structural changes of the flexible loop, C473-C486 or C1-C2 loop of I-EGF2 in the \u03b2-knee, which has been shown to modulate integrin activation by mutagenesis studies. No significant structural differences were observed between the PSI domains having Leu33 and Pro33. We next compared the ligand binding of \u03b23-Leu33 and \u03b23-Pro33 induced by Mn 2+ or talin head domain. No significant differences were observed either in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 or \u03b1V\u03b23, indicating that the Leu33Pro substitution may not affect \u03b23 integrin activation. However, the PSI C26-C38 loop harboring the Leu33Pro polymorphism moves closer to the I-EGF1 domain in the extended conformation. In addition, we found that a completely conserved arginine (Arg93 in \u03b23) at the PSI/hybrid domain interface is important for maintaining the resting integrin state since the alanine or glutamine substitution renders \u03b21, \u03b22 and \u03b23 integrin hyperactive. Interestingly, a naturally occurring \u03b23-Arg93Gln substitution has been shown to disrupt the HPA-1a epitope. Finally, based on our c\u03b23-E2 structure, we built the extended full-length \u03b23 structures with either closed or open headpiece, which can perfectly fit into the EM structures of extended \u03b1IIb\u03b23 with either closed or open headpiece, respectively. In summary, our study provides structural details of an extended \u03b23 integrin, showing the conformational changes at the PSI, I-EGF1 and I-EGF2 domains, demonstrating their importance in regulating integrin activation and alloimmune response.
