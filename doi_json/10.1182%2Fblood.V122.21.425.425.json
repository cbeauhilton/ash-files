    "abstract_text": "Context Increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, dementia, cancer, and death has been found among individuals with elevated transferrin saturation (TS). Although TS has been linked to specific diseases, little research has focused on the relationship between elevated TS and current health status. Purpose This study examined the relationship between elevated TS and measures of health status (telomere length and patient-reported health-related quality of life) to assess whether elevated TS is associated with negative patient outcomes beyond increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Methods We conducted an analysis of the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study supplemented with assays for leukocyte telomere length in adults (>25 years old). The HEIRS Study identified individuals through a multiethnic, multicenter sample of 101,168 US and Canadian adults. Screening was done with serum biochemical tests of iron status and hemochromatosis ( HFE) gene mutation testing. Our sample was comprised of HEIRS subjects with responses on health-related quality of life (general health (GH) and mental health (MH) subscales of the SF-36 Health Survey), and known leukocyte telomere length (n=669). Leukocyte telomere length was assessed through a quantitative PCR-based technique (qPCR). Unadjusted mean values of the general health status subscale, the mental health status subscale and telomere length were compared between groups with elevated TS (>45% for women and >50% for men) versus non-elevated TS (60% versus with non-elevated TS (<45% for women and <50% for men). For each of the quantitative outcomes of GH, MH, and telomere length, separate general linear regression models were formed with TS elevation as a dichotomous predictor, controlled for demographic characteristics as well as health conditions associated with iron overload. Results Among individuals with elevated TS (>45% for women and >50% for men), who also had a usual source of care, only 5.2% reported ever being told by a doctor that they had an elevated iron condition. Mean values for GH and MH, and telomere length were significantly lower in those with elevated TS ( Table 1 ; p60%) versus non-elevated TS.

View Large Conclusions Increased surveillance of elevated TS may be in order as elevated TS is associated with decreased health status and very few patients with elevated TS are aware of their condition.
