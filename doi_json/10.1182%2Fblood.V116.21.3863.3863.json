    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3863 The transcription factor Runx1 is required for the generation of all definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and for normal megakaryocyte, lymphocyte and granulocyte terminal maturation. Runx1 and its cofactor CBF-\u03b2 are also the most common targets of chromosomal translocations in human leukemias. Somatic and germline point mutations in Runx1 occur in myelodysplastic syndrome and undifferentiated leukemias, and are associated with a poor prognosis. Despite the key roles that Runx1 plays in normal and malignant hematopoiesis, its transcriptional mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this study, we purified Runx1 containing multiprotein complexes from megakaryocytic cells and identified several associated chromatin-remodeling complexes, including Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), NuRD, SWI/SNF and MLL/TrxG. Interactions were validated by independent biochemical assays and demonstrate a direct interaction between Runx1 and the PRC1 component Bmi1. ChIP-seq studies identified a large overlap between Runx1/CBF-\u03b2 and Ring1b (another PRC1 core component) occupied sites, with 45% of the peaks at these genes < 200 bp from each other. ShRNA mediated gene knockdown of CBF-\u03b2 shows differential gene expression of many of the co-occupied genes. Among the direct CBF-\u03b2/Ring1b co-occupied targets are other key hematopoietic transcription factors including FOG-1, SCL and Lyl1, and a number of cell adhesion related genes. ShRNA knockdown of Ring1b impairs megakaryocyte endomitosis, partially phenocopying Runx1 deficient megakaryocytes. Morpholino mediated knockdown of Ring1b or Bmi1 in zebrafish embryos reduces the number of phenotypic definitive HSCs, also partially phenocopying Runx1 morphants. We also show that Runx1/CBF-\u03b2 interact with Ring1b in the human T cell line Jurkat, and that Ring1b occupies Runx1/CBF-\u03b2 bound sites of key direct target genes in primary murine thymocytes, including CD4, TCR\u03b2, and Th-POK. Surprisingly, we did not find enrichment for histone 2A monoubiquitination at most of the megakaryocytic and T-lymphocyte co-occupied sites examined, suggesting that PRC1 acts through alternate mechanisms at these genes. Collectively, these data provide evidence for a broad role of PRC1 in Runx1 mediated gene regulation.
