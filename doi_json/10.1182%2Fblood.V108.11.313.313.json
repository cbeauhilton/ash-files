    "abstract_text": "Background : Intravenous busulfan formulation results in less variability in patient systemic busulfan exposure when compared to oral dosing using the plasma area under the time-concentration curve (AUC). With four times daily busulfan dosing in other regimens, low AUC is associated with relapsed leukemias and graft failure, and high AUC with toxicities. We investigated a convenient once daily IV busulfan dosing regimen, which allows complete drug clearance between doses, in combination with fludarabine as conditioning for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Purpose : To assess once daily IV busulfan together with fludarabine for interpatient variability in AUC and correlation between busulfan AUC and transplant toxicities and outcomes. Methods : 130 patients with hematologic malignancies received IV busulfan (Busulfex, ESP Pharma) 3.2 mg/kg on days \u22125 to \u22122 and fludarabine 50 mg/m 2 on days \u22126 to \u22122 prior to HCT in a myeloablative regimen. TBI 200 cGy \u00d7 2 was given to 51 patients with acute leukemias. Graft vs host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis comprised methotrexate, cyclosporine A, and Thymoglobulin (Genzyme) 4.5 mg/kg in divided doses over three days pretransplant. Busulfan concentrations were determined by UV-HPLC. Results : Plasma AUC varied four-fold (range 2184\u20137794 \u03bcM.min, median 4822) with once daily IV Bu dosing. Previous studies have shown increased toxicity with four daily doses of Bu when AUC >1500\u03bcM.min/dose, therefore patients were analyzed in groups with once daily IV busulfan AUC greater than (n=16) and less than (n=114) 6000\u03bcM.min. Patient characteristics between groups were similar except for a higher rate of ABO incompatibility (p=0.02) in the group with AUC >6000\u03bcM.min. Estimated overall survival (OS) of the entire group was 70% at 12 months (95% CI 61\u201377%) and 62% at 36 months (95% CI 52\u201370%). Patients with an AUC >6000\u03bcM.min had worse overall survival than those with AUC 6000\u03bcM.min (NRM 44% vs 14%, p=0.002; 3y PFS 16% vs 58%, p=0.0003). There was no difference in grade II-IV acute graft vs host disease (GVHD) or chronic GVHD, and no difference in specific toxicities other than a trend to less grade II-III stomatitis vs grade 0\u20131 stomatitis in the low AUC group (p=0.08). Conclusion : Although daily IV busulfan dosing provides more predictable AUC than oral dosing, four-fold variability remains when it is used with fludarabine in this regimen. These data suggest AUC >6000\u03bcM.min is associated with poorer outcomes and support the role of therapeutic dose monitoring and dose adjustment.",
