    "abstract_text": "Background Prevnar, is a multi-valent conjugate vaccine given to children and adults over 50 for the prevention of Streptococcus pneumonia , otis media and pneumococcal pneumonia. The conjugate in Prevnar is a CRM-197 protein molecule which is a nontoxic recombinant Diphtheria toxin . Prevnar serves as an excellent tool in monitoring overall immune response changes in myeloma patients\u2019 pre and post treatment. Humoral B-cell responses can be measured by antibody responses to the pneumococcal antigens, while T cell responses to CRM-197. Clinical Study We previously conducted a study to determine the efficacy of lenalidomide to augment vaccine specific responses in patients with myeloma. Two cohorts of patients were studied. In cohort A (N=10), the first Prevnar vaccine was given two weeks prior to starting lenalidomide and the second vaccine on day 14 of cycle 2 of lenalidomide. In cohort B (N=7), both Prevnar vaccines were given on lenalidomide (day 14 of cycle 2 and 4). As we previously reported patients in cohort B had an overall better B and T cell response to Prevnar compared to cohort A. These responses were due to an overall change in B and T cell phenotype attained with lenalidomide therapy. Results Prospectively, patients in cohort B also had an unexpected overall increase in disease response and in response duration. In Cohort A only 10% of patients responded to therapy while 60% of patients in Cohort B had a clinical response. The patients with a measurable clinical response had a 5-fold increase in the percentage of tumor specific bone marrow (BM) T cells after two vaccinations with Prevnar whereas the non-responding patients had no increase in tumor specific BM T cells. Parelleling the anti-tumor response, responders showed a 15 fold increase in CRM-197 specific BM T cells after the second vaccination. Patients with no clinical response showed minimal CRM-197 T cell immunity. CRM-197 is a specific inhibitor of HB-EGF; syndecan-1 (CD138) is an HB-EGF co-receptor as well as a marker for myeloma plasma cells. We hypothesized that HB-EGF specific responses produced by vaccination with the Prevnar vaccine, and CRM-197 specifically, may have contributed to the overall increased clinical responses in our clinical trial. Responding patients had a 5-fold increase in HB-EGF specific BM T cells after vaccine 2 while clinical non-responders had no increase in HB-EGF specific BM T cells. T cells specificity for purified HB-EGF correlated with both CRM-197 and tumor specific responses. Finally the myeloma cell lines U266, H929, KMS-11 and KMS-12 co-stained for CD138 and HB-EGF with 47% of CD138+ myeloma cells co-expressing HB-EGF. Conclusions We hypothesize that the CRM-197 moiety of the Prevnar vaccine can prime T cell responses against HB-EGF on plasma cells. This immune response, in turn, weakens the tumor stromal interactions in the tumor microenvironment and potentially enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of immunomodulatory drugs such as lenalidomide. Therefore, Prevnar may possibly serve as a candidate anti-myeloma vaccine. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
