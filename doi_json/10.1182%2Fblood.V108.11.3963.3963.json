    "abstract_text": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) in association with sickle cell crisis is rare. We present a case of sickle cell crisis and TTP. This is 48 years old Nigerian male with history of mild sickle cell anemia since childhood presented with sickle cell crisis and mental state changes. On admission labs are hematocrit of 20 and platelet count of 212,000. He was treated for sickle cell crisis but developed acute dysuria and progressively worsening anemia (Hct-13.7) and thrombocytopenia (Plt-9000) with sickle cell and fragmented RBCs on peripheral smear with LDH of 8772. This picture was consistent with TTP. Patient was immediately started on plasma exchange. Patient received a course of plasma exchange as well as hemodialysis and his condition improved, with return of platelet count to normal (232), LDH to baseline (276). Patient was discharged with mild renal insufficiency (serum creatinine-2.3) off dialysis and plasma exchange. Conclusion: TTP is a micro vascular occlusive disorder characterized by systemic or intrarenal aggregation of platelets, thrombocytopenia, and mechanical injury to erythrocytes. It is associated with pentard of signs and symptoms: thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes on peripheral blood smear), neurological abnormalities, renal failure and fever. In practice thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels are often sufficient for the diagnosis. Our patient with sickle cell crisis was a diagnostic challenge and it is our belief that TTP evolved during inpatient therapy for painful crisis. We believe his hemolysis was due to sickle cell disease and TTP. The syndrome was reversed with prompt and aggressive treatment with plasmapharesis. (1, H. E. Lee, V. J. Marder, L. J. Logan, S.
