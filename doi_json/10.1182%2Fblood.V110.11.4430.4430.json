    "abstract_text": "Background: SEER data indicate that African Americans (AA) have a lower incidence of DLBCL but a higher mortality rate than Caucasians (C). To investigate this, we conducted a single-center analysis of AA and C patients with DLBCL at UAB. UAB is a primary care facility and the main tertiary referral center in Alabama. It is located in Jefferson County where the average African American population of 39% is nearly triple the national average. Methods: After IRB approval, patients diagnosed with DLBCL from 1995 to 2007 were identified from pathology, referral, and UAB tumor registry databases. Baseline demographic data including race, age at diagnosis, stage, treatment administered, response to treatment, and survival were extracted. Serum LDH levels and performance status were not consistently available in medical records and therefore not included in the final analysis. Patients with monomorphic post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease and primary CNS lymphoma were excluded. Associations between race and stage, treatment (first-line rituximab, anthracycline, or combination therapy), response, and outcome were analyzed using Chi-squared or Cochran Mantel-Haenszel statistical analysis. Results: A total of n=309 (n=32 AA and n=277 C) patients were identified. AA patients were diagnosed at a significantly younger age than C patients [median age 49 (range: 22\u201390) vs. 61 (range: 16\u201391), respectively; p=0.0131]. AA patients also presented with advanced stage disease (Ann Arbor stage III\u2013IV) more frequently (69% vs. 52%, p=0.046). No difference in extranodal disease presentation or in complete response rate to first-line therapy was noted. As expected, those with early stage disease, age <60, and those given first-line rituximab +/\u2212 anthracycline therapy had superior survival regardless of race. No difference in overall survival was seen between AA and C patients (p=0.1306). However, AA patients had an inferior survival to C patients when the analysis was restricted to patients who received either first-line treatment with rituximab (p=0.0658), anthracycline (p=0.0188), or combination (p=0.0196).

This single-center experience confirms SEER data and suggests a possible difference in tumor biology or treatment effect, although potential socioeconomic factors can not be excluded.",
