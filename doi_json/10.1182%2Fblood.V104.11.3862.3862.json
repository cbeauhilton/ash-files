    "abstract_text": "Autologous T lymphocytes can be employed for immune therapy of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In an earlier study ( Biol Blood Marrow Transplant  2002 ; 8 : 557 ), we found that AML cells can be used as antigen presenting cells to activate and expand T cells in culture with IL-2 and monoclonal antibody (mAb) to CD3. In this study, we found that a substantial proportion of the expanded T cells expressed CD33 (34 \u00b1 16%; range: 8 \u2013 58%; N=11) and CD13 (26 \u00b1 5%; range: 22 \u2013 33%), but not CD14. It is unlikely that the myeloid markers were absorbed onto the activated T cells, since the same expression pattern was observed in cultures with purified T cells from normal donors. A literature review disclosed two reports that also observed co-expression of CD33 on activated T cells from both AML patients and normal controls ( Schmidt-Wolf et al, Br J Haematol.  1995 ; 90 : 512 ; Nakamura et al, letter in Blood , 1994 ; 83 : 1442 ). We measured the functional capacity of the activated T cells in a 4-hr Cr-51 release assay. Pre-incubation of the T cells with anti-CD33 mAb and/or anti-CD13 mAb did not change the cytotoxicity against AML cells. Also, killing of AML cells was not affected by the depletion of CD33 + or CD13 + activated T cells using magnetic beads. The activated T cells migrated in a chemotactic response to a peptide analog (CTCE-0214) of Stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) when measured in a trans-well assay. When activated T cells were pre-incubated with anti-CD33 mAb, enhanced chemotaxis was observed in response to CTCE-0214 (39.9 \u00b1 0.5% vs 26.9 \u00b1 0.3%, p < 0.001). However, incubation with anti-CD13 mAb did not change the proportion of chemotactic cells. The results of this study confirmed that myeloid antigens can be induced on activated T cells from patients with AML and that there are differences in the mobility of CD33 + T cells in the presence of a chemotactic molecule. Further study of the biological significance of CD33 expression on activated T cells in AML and other diseases is warranted.",
