    "abstract_text": "Aims: The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of pegfilgrastim in patients affected by heavily pretreated MM, treated with pomalidomide-dexamethasone, in order to determine whether a single subcutaneous injection of pegfilgrastim is as effective as daily injections of standard filgrastim, in terms of haematological toxicity, febrile neutropenic episodes, antibiotic usage and hospedalization duration. Methods: We enrolled 33 patients (19 male and 14 female) median age at diagnosis 69 years (r. 52-84), and median age at start of treatment 76 years (r.56-90) treated with several lines of treatments (median 7, r. 2-11), every refractory to all the drugs previously received, received Pomalidomide-Dexamethasone (Pomalidomide 4 mg for 21 days, Dexamethasone 40 mg days 1,8,15,22, pegfilgrastim day +8) every 28 days, until progression. Results: Since first course, received in domestic setting, with a very good compliance, patients performed blood counts once weekly and received, from day +8 to day +19 (\"day + 1\" when the protocol starts), prophylactic oral chinolonic antibiotics and anti-fungal drugs. During neutropenia after first cycle, Filgrastim (5 \u03bcgr/kg/day for 3 days) was given if neutrophils count was <1500 x 10^9 cells/L. Median number of filgrastim administrations was 4.8 (r. 3-6); nadir neutropenia was registered after a median of 10.7 days (r. 7-14); median of nadir neutrophil count was 1.17 x 10^9 cells/L (range 0.3 - 1.5 x 10^9 cells/L), with maximum duration of 14 days. From the second course, all patients switched to prophylaxis with pegfilgrastim (6 mg), injected subcutaneously with a single administration on day +3 independently from the neutrophil count at that time. During pegfilgrastim, neutropenia was never longer than 8 days, with a consequent reduction of neutropenia-related infections. Median nadir neutrophil count, evaluated for every patients for at least three courses of therapy (r. 3-6) registered at day +11, was 1.39 (range 0.9-2.2 x 10^9 cells/L). Only 4 patients needed a supplement of 3 administrations of filgrastim. Pegfilgrastim was well tolerated in all patients: main side effects in our patients were mild fever and bone pain (21.2%). Conclusions: In conclusions, in patients affected by heavily pretreated MM treated with pomalidomide-dexamethasone, pegfilgrastim seems to reduce the incidence of severe neutropenia and infections and may increase the possibility to maintain the scheduled time of treatment.
