    "abstract_text": "CD25, CD27, CD30 and CD40 are receptors for IL-2, CD70, CD153 and CD154, respectively, which provide important signaling for both B- and T-cell immune responses. We therefore examined the sera of patients with Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinemia (WM), a B-cell disorder characterized by excess IgM secreting bone marrow lymphoplasmacytic cells (LPC) for the presence of soluble CD25, CD27, CD30, CD40, IL-2, CD153, and CD154. Sera were from patients with active disease and off-therapy. Sera from healthy age matched donors (HD) was used for controls. The results of these studies were as follows:  . . WM ELISA Results .
