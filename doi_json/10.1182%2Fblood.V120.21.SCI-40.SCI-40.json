    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-40 During systemic infection and inflammation, immune effector cells are in high demand and are rapidly consumed at sites of need. While adaptive immune cells have high proliferative potential, innate mature immune cells are mostly postmitotic and need to be replenished from bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Indeed, severe clinical infection, particularly infections challenging the innate immune response, lead to an increase in hematopoietic differentiation and throughput in bone marrow, involving subsequent differentiation stages from hematopoietic stem cells, multipotent progenitors, as well as early-lineage and late-lineage restricted hematopoietic progenitors. A fundamental question is how the increased need is sensed and translated in enhanced production and how adequate levels of response are guided. Recent research has shed light on conserved intracellular and extracellular pathogen recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors, that are expressed on nonhematopoietic and hematopoietic effector cells and cause activation upon ligation. This activation results in production of hematopoietic growth, survival, activation, and migration factors operating at site on effector cells, but also at remote primary hematopoietic sites to increase production upon need. Recent research by several groups, including ours, surprisingly revealed that conserved pattern-recognition receptors are also expressed on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in bone marrow, implying a direct effect of systemically available ligands on these cellular populations. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that, for example, ligation of Toll-like receptor 4 by its cognate agonist lipopolysaccharide can lead to divisional activation, proliferation, lineage-directed differentiation, and migration of hematopoietic stem and lineage-restricted progenitor cells, all aimed at efficient contribution to immune responses and rapid reestablishment of hematopoietic homeostasis. The relative contribution of pathogen sensing by hematopoietic and diverse nonhematopoietic cells to appropriate hematopoietic responses, as well as the subcellular translation of the signals, is the focus of ongoing research. Also to be discussed will be how chronic infectious and inflammatory processes, which are frequently associated with aging, might impinge on hematopoiesis, potentially fostering hematopoietic stem cell diseases as exhaustion or transformation.
