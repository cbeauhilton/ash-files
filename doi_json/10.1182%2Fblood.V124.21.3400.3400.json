    "abstract_text": "Introduction. The role of TP53 tumor-suppressor gene in mediating cellular basic tumor suppressive mechanisms is crucial: its utmost importance is underscored by a 50% mutational rate among most human cancers. In MM, TP53 is rarely reported as being affected either by deletions or mutations, even if chromosome (chr) 17p13 copy number (CN) loss defines a samples subgroup with a particularly poor prognosis. Here we aim at retrospectively analyzing by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) the TP53 gene inactivation in newly diagnosed MM, assessing the mutational events\u2019 frequency and their clinical impact. Samples and methods. A cohort of 92 MM, receiving up-front velcade (vel)-based regimens, followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, was included in this molecular study. Response to therapy was evaluated according to the IMWG criteria. DNA was obtained from CD138+ highly purified plasma cells and profiled by SNPs array (Affymetrix). TP53 gene mutational status was analysed employing an amplicon-targeted deep NGS approach (GSJ, 454 Life Sciences). A novel upcoming NGS data analysis software was employed to detect variants from raw sequencing data and to compare them to IARC database. As a validation, 30 randomly chosen samples have been re-sequenced. p53 activity was evaluated by p-p53 and p53 immunoblot assays. Results. Ultra-deep TP53 coding sequence analysis (median depth: 1060) highlighted the presence of a median of 1.8 variants per samples in 73/92 (79%) MM: a total of 131 nucleotide substitutions emerged, with variants allele frequencies (VAF) ranging from 1 to 99% (median 1.3%). The polymorphism c.215C>G (validated as SNP1042522) was the most prevalent detected variant, recurring in ~40% of the analysed samples. TP53 variants were assessed according to the SIFT classification, in order to identify either neutral or deleterious mutations, on the basis of their predicted effect at amino acid level. 36 cases carried 42 deleterious variants (VAF=1.2%): they were mostly missense substitutions affecting mainly the DNA binding domain; most deleterious variants (67%) were predicted as non-functional at protein level. 9 samples carried 21 neutral variants (VAF=1.1%), which were mostly missense mutations, again mainly affecting the DNA binding domain. Finally, 28 samples carried 68 SIFT unclassified variants \u2013 among which several polymorphisms were counted \u2013 (VAF=94.6%). Of these, 29 were silent substitutions affecting the DNA-binding domain, 32 were missense variants affecting the SH3-like/Proline- rich domain. To assess the genomic background of deep-sequenced MM, SNPs arrays were performed on 83/92 samples: 14/83 (17%) carried a TP53 CN loss (1N) on chr17p13.1. The incidence of TP53 hemizygous deletion was higher among cases carrying deleterious mutations, as compared to cases carrying either neutral or unclassified mutations (25%, 12,5% and 12%, respectively). 2/17 non-mutated samples carried TP53 hemizygous deletion, as well. Interestingly, an Rb1 tumour suppressor gene CN loss on chr13q14.2 significantly characterized samples carrying either mutated (deleterious variant) or deleted TP53 (p=0.006). The activation state of p53 was evaluated by p-p53 immunoblotting assay, showing the absence of phosphorilation either in 3 TP53 deleted cases, or in 3 cases carrying deleterious variants; on the contrary p-p53 was observed in 4 non-mutated cases. Finally, clinical correlations were performed on 81 MM, for whom clinical data were available, showing that the presence of either TP53 hemizygous deletions or at least one TP53 deleterious variant was more likely associated to the response to vel-based induction therapy (frequencies of \u2264partial response were 35% and 64% among samples carrying or not impaired TP53 , respectively; p =0.05). Conversely, the frequency of progression events was slightly higher among MM carrying impaired TP53 (69% vs. 50%). Conclusions. The analysis by ultra-deep next generation sequencing of TP53 coding sequence in a cohort of newly diagnosed MM highlighted an unexpected, still un-explored, high rate of TP53 variants, recurring with a wide range of frequencies among samples. The impact of TP53 damage on MM disease course has to be confirmed in randomized clinical trial.
