    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1316 In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), translocations and the resulting fusion proteins (FPs) such as PML/RAR, AML1/ETO and DEK/CAN represent the leukemia initiating event. t(6;9)(DEK/CAN)-positive AML is classified as a separate clinical entity, because of its early onset and poor prognosis. We recently have shown that DEK/CAN is a leukemia-inducing oncogene, which targets a very small subpopulation of primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) for leukemic transformation. Like other FPs, DEK/CAN also interferes with the epigenetic regulation of transcription by modifying key processes of chromatin modeling such as histone acetylation and methylation as well as DNA methylation. In the DEK/CAN fusion protein, all the chromatin binding domains of DEK are conserved and we recently showed that DEK/CAN is associated to chromatin and strongly interferes with chromatin modeling by inhibiting the decondensation of chromatin and accessibility to transcription. As a \u201cClass 1 mutation\u201d, the oncogenic internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the receptor tyrosine kinase Flt3 (Flt3-ITD) is found in 88% of the t(6;9)-positive AML-patients, which otherwise is present in about 30% of other AML cases. The simultaneous presence of Flt3-ITD and DEK/CAN in AML is correlated with a high WBC and significantly lower rates of complete remission. Aim of the study was to determine the effect of Flt3-ITD on the DEK/CAN-induced leukemic phenotype. Therefore we expressed Flt3-ITD and DEK/CAN from a single vector as p2A fusion protein in order to obtain an equimolar expression of the two proteins. We investigated the capacity to mediate factor-independent growth of the single factors and in combination in the myeloid progenitor cell line 32D upon IL-3 withdrawal. The leukemic phenotype was studied in primary Sca1+/Lin- murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (mHSPC) retrovirally transduced with DEK/CAN, FLT3-ITD and FLT3-ITD-p2a-DEK/CAN. These cells were tested for their differentiation potential in liquid culture, for their serial replating capacity in semi-solid medium, their stem cell capacity in colony-forming unit spleen - day12 (CFU-S12) assays, and their potential to induce leukemia in sublethally irradiated recipients. Here we show that I.) Flt3-ITD mediated factor-independent growth alone and in presence of DEK/CAN, but the onset of factor-independent growth was delayed by DEK/CAN; II.) FLT3-ITD did not influence the differentiation potential of DEK/CAN-positive HPSCs; III.) Flt3-ITD increased the colony-number of DEK/CAN-positive, but not the overall serial replating efficiency of DEK/CAN-positive HPSCs; IV.) FLT3-ITD accelerated and increased efficiency of leukemia induction by DEK/CAN in vivo , without modifying either the morphological or the immunological phenotype of DEK/CAN-induced leukemia. Finally we investigated whether FLT3-ITD influences the known capacity of histone-deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACi) to revert the leukemogenic potential of DEK/CAN. Therefore we employed a xenograft model based on the patient derived FKH-1 cell line expressing both FLT3-ITD and DEK/CAN. We found that exposure to the HDACi Dacinostat prevented the leukemia-induction in this model. Taken together these findings strongly suggest that DEK/CAN drives the transformation of immature HPSCs which is supported by the presence FLT3-ITD regarding proliferation, without strong effects on the leukemic phenotype induced by DEK/CAN.
