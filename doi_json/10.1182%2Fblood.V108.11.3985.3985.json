    "abstract_text": "The platelet counts of patients with cyclic thrombocytopenia (CT) are occasionally associated with menstruation, yet its mechanism is unknown. Leptin has been shown to stimulate the production of Th1 cytokines ( Nature  1998 ; 27 : 897 ), which dominate in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) ( Blood  2004 ; 103 : 2645 ), and a recent study showed that the serum levels of leptin, whose secretion is menstruation-related, are high in ITP ( Eur J Haemataol  2004 ; 72 : 348 ). Here we examined the serial serum levels of leptin in 3 patients with CT by radioimmunoassay. Case 1 is a 29-year-old woman with ITP who had repeated spontaneous abortion at an early phase of pregnancy accompanied by transient severe thrombocytopenia. Case 2 is a 37-year-old woman diagnosed as having ITP and autoimmune neutropenia during her second pregnancy, whose platelet counts became cyclic after delivery. Case 3 is a 28-year-old woman, who developed CT after splenectomy performed for refractory ITP two years before. The serum leptin levels were inversely correlated with the platelet counts in case 1 (r = \u22120.573, P =0.047, n=13) and case 3 ( r = \u22120.771, P =0.029, n=9), and a similar inverse correlation was observed in case 2, although the correlation was statistically not significant (r = \u22120.524, P=0.116, n=10). These findings suggest that leptin might play an important role in the pathogenesis of menstruation-associated CT. Further interventional studies to give leptin and its antagonists to the patients with CT, as well as to ITP model mice, will be warranted."
