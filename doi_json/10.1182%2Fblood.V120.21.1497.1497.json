    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1497 Background: Vincristine is active in many pediatric cancers, but cumulative neuromuscular toxicity is often dose limiting and requires a maximum dose cap. Liposomal carriers are capable of increasing the therapeutic index of anticancer agents by altering pharmacokinetic behavior. Vincristine sulfate liposomes injection (VSLI, Marqibo\u00ae) is a novel preparation of standard vincristine encapsulated in sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposomes. Clinical trials have demonstrated safety, tolerability and activity in adults with leukemias, lymphomas and solid tumors. Pediatric experience with VSLI is limited. Design: This single center Phase I dose-escalation study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to assess safety, pharmacokinetics and activity of VSLI in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory cancer. Patients with active central nervous system disease or \u2265grade 2 sensory or motor neuropathy are excluded. Dose escalation is per a standard 3 + 3 Phase I trial design with enrollment following a rolling 6 strategy. VSLI is administered IV over 60-minutes every 7 days (\u00b1 3 days) for 4 consecutive weeks for a 28-day treatment cycle (4 doses/cycle). Cycles may be delayed by up to 1 week for toxicity. Two dose levels have been tested to date: 1.75 mg/m 2 and 2.25 mg/m 2 (adult MTD). No individual dose cap is employed. A validated HPLC tandem mass spectrometry assay was used to quantitate total (liposomal encapsulated and non-encapsulated) vincristine. Results: 9 patients have been treated (Table): 6 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 3 with solid tumors. All patients were heavily pre-treated and 2 had prior stem cell transplants. 6 of 9 completed at least 1 cycle of therapy, with 1 each removed early for alternative therapy, complications of ALL, or dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Most treatment-related adverse events were reversible grade 1 and 2 severity including hepatic transaminase elevation, parasthesia, low white blood cell count, neutropenia and fatigue. 2 patients evaluable for hematologic toxicity developed grade 4 neutropenia that spontaneously and rapidly resolved. No DLT occurred on dose level 1. Grade 4 aspartate aminotransferase elevation was observed in one patient at the second dose level and this dose level is being expanded. 1 patient treated at dose level 1 had dose de-escalation starting with Cycle 2 Dose 3 due to neuropathy. No patient was taken off study due to neurotoxicity. 7 of 9 patients received a VSLI dose that exceeded the 2 mg dose limit set for standard vincristine. 6 patients were evaluable for response: 1 had a complete remission (CR) (minimal residual disease negative by flow cytometry); 3 had stable disease (SD); and 2 had progressive disease (PD). First-dose pharmacokinetic analysis revealed wide interpatient variation (Table). The median (range) maximum concentrations (C max ) of total vincristine (ng/ml) were 1,485 (845-2,120) and 2,450 (1,690-3,690) at dose levels 1 and 2 respectively. The median plasma half-life (T\u00bd) was 8.5 and 13.5 hours at dose levels 1 and 2 respectively (range 1.8 to 40.4 hours). Conclusions: VSLI appears to be safe, tolerable and demonstrates preliminary activity in pediatric patients with refractory ALL and solid tumors. The toxicity spectrum appears to be similar in children and adults. Clearance of total vincristine in our study is approximately 100-fold lower in comparison to administration of standard vincristine. VSLI allows for intensification of vincristine therapy in children with cancer. Accrual to the Phase I component at the adult recommended dose is ongoing and an expanded Phase II cohort in pediatric patients with ALL is planned.  Diagnosis . Age (yr) . Dose Level . Dose (mg) .
