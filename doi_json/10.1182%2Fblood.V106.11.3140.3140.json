    "abstract_text": "To reveal the novel function of erythroid progenitor cells in fetal erythropoiesis, the gene expression pattern in umbilical cord blood (CB)-derived CD36 + erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) was analyzed using cDNA microarray containing 240 cytokine and growth factor related genes. Among the genes analyzed, insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) gene showed a 124-fold higher level of expression in CB-EPCs, compared with that seen in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (table1). Real-time PCR revealed that the IGF-II mRNA levels in CB-EPCs were higher than those seen in lymphocytes or monocytes separated from CB or PBMCs. When CB-EPCs were cultured with erythropoietin (EPO) in serum-free medium, the number of erythroid colonies was decreased in the presence of IGF-II-neutralizing antibody. To further assess the role of IGF-II in erythropoiesis, we purified erythroid colony-forming cells (ECFCs) from human umbilical cord blood by magnetic selection and liquid culture with IL-3, stem cell factor and EPO. The expression levels of IGF-II, type 1 or 2 IGF receptor in the mature ECFCs were higher than those in the immature ECFCs. Addition of IGF-II-neutralizing antibody decreased the number of ECFCs in liquid culture with EPO. The anti-proliferative effect of IGF-II-neutralizing antibody was evident in both dimethylthiazole tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assays. When apoptosis of cells was examined using Annexin V, the addition of IGF-II-neutralizing antibody increased apoptosis, thereby indicating the anti-apoptotic effects of IGF-II secreted from erythroid cells. Furthermore, ECFCs failed to undergo normal erythroid maturation in the presence of IGF-II-neutralizing antibody, as assessed by flow cytometric and morphologic analyses. These findings indicate that IGF-II, which is produced by erythroid progenitor cells themselves, has crucial roles in controlling erythropoiesis by modulating apoptosis, proliferation and maturation via an autocrine mechanism.
