    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4829 Introduction: Medical indication of flow cytometric immunophenotyping includes diagnosis, classification, prognosis and disease monitoring. This is an important tool that each time is more used in hematology. Third world countries could not stay away from this technology, effort should be made to get access to it and not only make diagnosis in morphology. Objective: To determinate the prevalence of immunophenotypes in neoplastic hematology in our region (Central-West Mexico). Material and Methods: Bone marrow samples referred to Laboratorios Fatima de Michoacan for flow cytometry immunophenotyping for neoplastic hematological disease. The protocol is based on the Report on the Second Latin American Consensus Conference for Flow Cytometric Immunophenotyping of Hematological Malignancies (Cytometry Part B (Clinical Cytometry) 2005;70B:39\u201344), and Immunophenotyping of acute leukemia and lymphoproliferative disorders: a consensus proposal of the European LeukemiaNet Work Package 10 (Leukemia 2011;25:567\u2013574). Results: One hundred and seventy two cases were diagnosed. Fourteen myelodisplastic syndromes were detected. Forty five acute myeloid leukemia; M0-M1 twenty two cases, 5 with aberrant expression of CD7, one with CD19 and one CD20; M2 four cases, 1 with aberrant expression of CD 2 and 1 with CD7; M3 four cases; M4 one case; M5 twelve cases, 3 aberrant expression of CD7; M6 and M7 one case each. Sixty five B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia; BI twenty three cases, 2 with aberrant expression of CD7, and 2 aberrant expression of CD13 and one with aberrant expression of CD 33; BII twenty cases, 1 aberrant expression of CD2, 1 aberrant expression of CD5, and 4 aberrant expression of CD33; BIII twenty one cases, 1 aberrant expression of CD3; BIV one case. Five T cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Thirty four chronic lymphoproliferative disorders; eighteen B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, two T cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, seven follicular lymphoma, three mantle cell lymphoma, three splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes and one hairy cell leukemia One adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma. One natural killer cell leukemia (CD94+, perforin +, granzyme +) Seven monoclonal gammapathies. Conclusions: It is important to create the experience with new diagnostic tools based on the regional protocols. Low prevalence of AML M2 presumably because of classic morphologic features. Low prevalence of monoclonal gammapathies because for recent incorporation to diagnosis, treatment and response criteria; it is expected that in future this prevalence will arise. This data is complemented, whenever it is possible, with chromosomal analysis to determinate the risk and treatment. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
