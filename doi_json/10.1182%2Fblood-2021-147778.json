    "abstract_text": "Background: Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) is the third most common lymphoma in Western countries, accounting for 8-12% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Delinger NM. Cancer Manag Res. 2018;10:315-24). MZL is categorized into nodal, extranodal, and splenic subtypes. While the relative 5-year survival rate for patients (pts) with MZL is 84.4% (Olszewski AJ, Castillo JJ. Cancer. 2013;119:629-38), pts often experience relapse or refractory (R/R) disease. Parsaclisib is a potent, highly selective, next-generation inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)\u03b4. Here we report results of the primary analysis of the cohort of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor (BTKi)-naive pts with R/R MZL treated with parsaclisib monotherapy in the open-label, phase 2 study CITADEL-204 (NCT03144674, EudraCT 2017-000970-12). Methods: Pts \u226518 years of age, with histologically confirmed MZL, prior receipt of \u22651 line of systemic therapy including anti-CD20 treatment, and either disease progression or inadequate response to most recent regimen were eligible. Pts had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) \u22642, radiologically measurable lymphadenopathy, lymphoid malignancy (extranodal), or histologically confirmed bone marrow infiltration (splenic). The study enrolled 2 cohorts: pts who received prior treatment with ibrutinib (cohort 1, N=10) or pts naive to BTKi therapy (cohort 2, N=100). Only data from cohort 2 are presented in this abstract. Pts were allocated to receive parsaclisib 20 mg once daily (QD) for 8 weeks followed by either 20 mg once weekly (weekly-dosing group [WG]) or 2.5 mg QD (daily-dosing group [DG]). Pts received prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia during the study. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC); secondary endpoints were duration of response (DOR), complete response rate (CRR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety and tolerability. All radiology-based endpoints were evaluated by an IRC. Results: At data cutoff for the primary analysis (Jan 15, 2021), 100 pts with MZL enrolled in cohort 2 (nodal 31.0%, extranodal 34.0%, and splenic 35.0%) had been treated (WG, N=28; DG, N=72). Median (range) age was 71.0 (35-95) years, 53.0% were male, and 95.0% had ECOG PS \u22641. 49.0% of pts had received 1 line, 31.0% received 2 lines, and 20.0% received \u22653 lines of prior systemic therapy (median [range], 2.0 [1-8]); 46.0% of pts had relapsed disease and 49.0% were refractory to their most recent prior therapy. 65.0% of pts had discontinued treatment, primarily due to adverse events (29.0%) or progressive disease (28.0%). The median (range) duration of treatment and follow-up from first dose to data cutoff were 13.4 (0.4-30.9) and 22.8 (11.9-37.0) months for all pts (N=100), and 11.6 (0.4-30.9) and 21.0 (11.9-37.0) months for the DG (N=72), respectively. The ORR (95% CI) was 58.0% (47.7-67.8) for all pts and 58.3% (46.1-69.8) for the DG ( Table 1 ); CRR (95% CI) was 6.0% (2.2-12.6) for all pts and 4.2% (0.9-11.7) for the DG. Among all treated pts who achieved complete or partial response, 65.5% of responses occurred at the first disease assessment (median time to response, 8.1 weeks); median DOR (95% CI) was 12.2 (8.1-17.5) months for all pts and the DG. Median PFS (95% CI) was 16.5 (13.5-19.6) and 16.5 (11.5-20.6) months for all pts and the DG, respectively. Median OS was not reached. Among 100 pts treated in cohort 2, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 96.0% of pts (grade \u22653 in 63.0%). The most common TEAEs were diarrhea (47.0%) and cough (23.0%), and the most common grade \u22653 TEAEs included diarrhea (12.0%), neutropenia and pneumonia (9.0% each), and colitis (7.0%). TEAEs leading to dose interruption or dose reduction occurred in 56.0% and 16.0% of pts, respectively. TEAEs led to treatment discontinuation in 29.0% of pts, the most common were diarrhea (9.0%) and colitis (5.0%). Serious TEAEs were experienced by 47.0% of pts overall, the most common was pneumonia (9.0%). 6.0% of pts experienced fatal TEAEs including febrile neutropenia and sepsis (1 pt each) that were considered treatment-related. Conclusion: Pts with R/R MZL demonstrated a rapid and durable clinical response to parsaclisib monotherapy. Treatment was generally well tolerated, and the safety profile was manageable. Results suggest parsaclisib may be a potential treatment option for R/R MZL.
