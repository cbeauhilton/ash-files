    "abstract_text": "Standard consolidation therapy of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) contains high-dose cytarabine (HiDC). However, optimal dose of cytarabine and benefit of additional chemotherapeutic agents remain unresolved problems. One hundred and forty-two patients among 173 newly diagnosed AML patients, who achieved complete remission following induction chemotherapy and subsequently received different consolidation therapies in 4 independent institutes, were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into 3 groups by consolidation regimens: HiDC (1.5-3g/m 2 , bid, Days 1,3,5) alone in 44 patients (Group A), HiDC plus anthracycline in 46 patients (Group B), and intermediate-dose cytarabine (1g/m 2 , bid, Days 1,3,5) plus anthracycline in 52 patients (Group C). Overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and event-free survival (EFS), were not significantly different in Group A vs. Group B. However, Group B showed longer RFS, DFS, and EFS, as compared with Group C. Treatment-related mortality was significantly higher in Group B, as compared with Group A ( P =0.040) and Group C ( P =0.013). Cytogenetic risk was the only significant prognostic factor in OS, RFS, DFS and EFS. In this study, the addition of anthracycline to HiDC as consolidation chemotherapy in AML patients did not improve treatment outcomes, and had more toxicity. HiDC enhanced RFS, DFS, and EFS, as compared with intermediate-dose cytarabine. Therefore, HiDC single therapy could be considered as standard consolidation therapy for non-promyelocytic AML Disclosures Choi: Alexion Pharmaceuticals: Research Funding.",
