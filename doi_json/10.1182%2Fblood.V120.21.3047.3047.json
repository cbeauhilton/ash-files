    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3047 Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) can expose patients to a transient but marked immunosuppression, during which viral infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. The control of these infections will ultimately depend on the restoration of adequate T-cell immunity. Most viral infections after SCT are caused by endogenous reactivation of persistent pathogens such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus (ADV) and Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV). Risk of viral complications is even higher under GvHD treatment or prophylaxis like calcineurin inhibitors and steroids. Post transplant often the immunosuppression needs to be reduced to improve viral complications with the risk of GvHD. The virus-specific T-cell responses in peripheral blood have been shown to be a good marker of immunological protection, but has not been used for clinical decision making and the guidance of drug plasma levels. Therefore, we performed a prospective clinical trial in 33 adult and pediatric patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation receiving pharmacologic immunosuppression with steroids, Cyclosporin A, Tacrolimus, Everolimus or Mycophenolate. Median Age was 16 years. T-cell responses were analyzed ex vivo against Cytomegalovirus (pp65), Adenovirus (hexon antigen) and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBNA, LMP) using intracellular cytokine staining. In addition in vitro analysis of the proliferation responses using CFSE were performed. Responses were compared to healthy donors. The T-cell responses in vitro under low, high and supraphysiologic plasma concentrations of the respective drugs were investigated. Under the direct influence of steroids, activated, virus-specific T-cells underwent apoptosis. Among the Calcineurin inhibitors, Tacrolimus had the strongest inhibition on virus-specific T-cell immunity, followed by Cyclosporin A. But, under low therapeutic levels, Virus speciffic T-cell responses have been able to develop in PBMCs. Mycophenolate had only in high concentrations a strong effect on the T-cell response against viral pathogens. Relevant differences in the frequency of virus-specific T-cells secreting IFN-g could be detected within the CD4 compartment in correlation to the level of immunosuppression. In conclusion we could show that detection of virus-specific T-cells could be used to guide the level of immunosuppression in case of viral complications after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, since emergence of in vivo T-cell responses was closely associated with a clearance or reduction of the viral load.
