    "abstract_text": "Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a leading cause of blood transfusion-related fatalities without available therapies. The pulmonary endothelium is damaged in TRALI, through incompletely understood pathogenic mechanisms, resulting in pulmonary edema. Generally, anti-leukocyte antibodies or biological response modifiers in the transfusion product, in combination with predisposing risk factors in the transfused recipient (e.g. inflammation), are responsible for initiation of TRALI. Remarkably, not all anti-leukocyte antibodies cause TRALI. In a previous in vitro study, we identified increased Fc-mediated complement activation to be a key feature of murine TRALI-inducing antibody 34-1-2S (anti-H-2K d ) compared to TRALI-resistant antibody SF1.1.10 (anti-H-2K d ) (Zeeuw van der Laan et al, Blood Adv 2020). In the current study, we further explored antibody-mediated TRALI mechanisms in vivo using our previously established TRALI mouse model in which mice are pre-depleted of protective CD4+ T cells and primed with LPS, followed by infusion of antibody 34-1-2S (Kapur et al, Blood 2017, Blood Adv 2018, Blood 2019). A key read-out for TRALI was the lung wet/dry weight ratio (Lung W/D, measure for pulmonary edema). We found that in vitro antibody-mediated complement activation was associated with in vivo antibody-mediated TRALI. 34-1-2S caused severe TRALI (complement activation: +++, Lung W/D: 7.4 \u00b1 0.21), while SF1.1.10 did not cause TRALI (complement activation: +, Lung W/D: 4.68 \u00b1 0.16). Furthermore, Fc-deglycosylated 34-1-2S still caused significant TRALI (complement activation: ++, in vivo Lung W/D: 5.16 \u00b1 0.52). TRALI development was fully Fc-dependent as 34-1-2S-Fab did not cause any TRALI (no complement activation, Lung W/D: 4.35 \u00b1 0.18). Importantly, we found significantly increased levels of complement C1q-C4 complexes in plasma samples of TRALI patients (n=46) compared to healthy controls (n=25): 6.49 \u00b1 5.27 vs 3.84 \u00b1 2.27 AU/ml, respectively, P: 0.0005,***. Similarly, C5a levels were significantly elevated in plasma samples of TRALI patients (n=53) compared to healthy controls (n=30): 2.52 \u00b1 2.17 vs 1.37 \u00b1 1.08 ng/ml, respectively, P: 0.0006,***. To further dissect the effect of the Fc-part of 34-1-2S in TRALI-induction, we aim to investigate the contribution of Fc-mediated complement activation vs Fc-receptor interaction. We therefore successfully generated chimeric variants of 34-1-2S with a humanized IgG1 Fc-domain containing mutations making them functionally complement dead (K322A), Fc-receptor dead (dG236) or both complement and Fc-receptor dead (PG LALA). We are currently investigating the effects of these variants on in vivo TRALI induction. We next investigated how the in vivo murine TRALI reaction was related to numbers of macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils in blood and lungs. We found that 34-1-2S-TRALI was associated with significantly decreased levels of macrophages in the lungs and increased levels in blood, compared to mice infused with PBS, SF1.1.10 or 34-1-2S-Fab, suggesting that Fc-mediated complement activation and TRALI induction is related to macrophage trafficking from lungs to blood. We did not observe any significant differences between blood and lung neutrophil levels of 34-1-2S-TRALI mice compared to SF1.1.10 TRALI-resistant mice. We hypothesized that in TRALI neutrophils undergo formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) induced by complement. We observed that C5a enabled potent neutrophil-chemotaxis in vitro (P: 0.0048,**). In addition, using direct immunofluorescence staining of extracellular DNA and Citrullinated histone H3, we observed that both LPS and C5a on their own could induce NET formation in vitro, which was synergistically increased with a combination of both LPS and C5a (P: 0.0417,*), as occurring during TRALI. Furthermore, we found increased levels of NETs to be present in plasma samples of TRALI patients (n=53) compared to healthy controls (n=30): 1.64 \u00b1 0.97 vs 0.80 \u00b1 0.34 MPO-DNA OD, respectively, P: 0.0002,***. Finally, we targeted the C5a-receptor (C5aR) using a C5aR-antagonist in our TRALI mouse model. Surprisingly, this did not prevent but even worsened TRALI (P: 0.0398,*), with elevated levels of blood monocytes and macrophages. This suggests that an approach directly targeting complement components may be a more promising therapeutic strategy to explore in combatting TRALI.
