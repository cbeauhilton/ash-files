    "abstract_text": "Introduction Several oral anti-factor IIa and factor Xa agents have recently been developed. These include the thrombin inhibitors Ximelagatran/Melagatran (M) and Dabigatran Etexilate/Dabigatran (D), which require endogenous conversion to the active agents D and M. The factor Xa inhibitors, Rivaroxaban (R) and Apixaban (A), are anti-Xa agents that do not require any endogenous activation. Ximelagatran was withdrawn from the market due to adverse reactions. Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, and Apixaban are approved for various clinical indications. Antagonism of the anticoagulant effect may be required in bleeding complications. Contradictory results were reported for the efficacy of various prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) with these new oral anticoagulants (NOACs). The purpose of this study was to determine the differences in the thrombin generation inhibitory profiles of the newer oral anticoagulant agents. Methods Commercially available PCCs namely Octaplex and Beriplex, were used as a source of Factors II, VII, IX and X. To investigate the effect of each of these agents, a working solution of 1U/ml of both PCCs were supplemented in a graded concentration of 0-1250ng/ml with M, D, R and A. Thrombin generation studies were carried out using a thromboplastin activator (RC High, Technoclone Vienna, Austria). Total thrombin generated was measured in terms of nM\u2019s. The IC-50 for each agent was calculated individually. The time course of thrombin generation was also measured following the kinetic profiles and AUC. Results Dabigatran and Melagatran produced relatively weaker inhibition of thrombin generation with the IC-50 values ranging from 410-110ng/ml in Beriplex and 350-1120ng/ml in Octaplex. Both Rivaroxaban and Apixaban produced strong inhibition of thrombin generation, with the IC-50 ranging from 58-62ng/ml in Octaplex; whereas, in Beriplex these values ranged from 48-50ng/ml. The onset time for thrombin generation and total thrombin formation was concentration dependent. The kinetics of thrombin generation with A and R were distinct from D and M. At concentrations below 310ng/ml the total amount of thrombin generated was comparable to the control; however, its formation was delayed. In both systems, D exhibited the weakest thrombin generation inhibitory potential. While the onset time of thrombin generation was delayed at concentrations below 310ng/ml the levels were comparable to or higher than the control. Discussion This data suggests that PCC\u2019s such as Octaplex and Beriplex can be used to generate thrombin and it\u2019s inhibition by new oral anticoagulant drugs. Octaplex generates much higher amount of thrombin than Beriplex at equivalent units. These results also show that in comparison to the oral anti-Xa agents, the oral anti-IIa agents are relatively weaker inhibitors of thrombin generation. These studies also suggest that the differential inhibition of the generation of thrombin through tissue factor by the anti-Xa and IIa agents may contribute to the potential neutralization profile of PCC\u2019s for these drugs.
