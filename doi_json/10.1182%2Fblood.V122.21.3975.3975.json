    "abstract_text": "Despite the success of targeted therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) remains largely incurable, most likely due to the treatment resistance of leukemic stem cells. Specific T-cell based immunotherapies for patients with CML might be able to eliminate these residual CML cells. For this goal the identification of tumor associated HLA-presented peptides, which are able to induce a tumor-specific T cell response, is indispensable. However, only few tumor associated antigens for CML are described till date. Thus the aim of this study was to identify for the first time naturally processed and presented HLA ligands from the cell surface of primary CML cells. HLA class I ligands from primary CML cells as well as from bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMNCs) and peripheral blood PBMCs of healthy donors were analyzed using the approach of direct isolation and identification of naturally presented HLA peptides by affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). LC-MS/MS peptide analysis provided qualitative and semi-quantitative information regarding the composition of the respective ligandomes. Comparative analysis of malignant and benign samples served to identify ligandome-derived tumor associated antigens (LiTAAs) and to select peptide vaccine candidates. So far 10 CML patients (8 chronic phase, 2 accelerated phase) and 30 healthy donors were analyzed within this study. We were able to identify a total of more than 8200 CML derived HLA ligands representing >4500 different source proteins, of which 734 were exclusively represented in CML, but not in healthy PBMCs/BMNCs. 55 of these CML exclusive antigens are presented on 3 or more of all examined CML patients, representing, as broadly represented LiTAAs, promising targets for peptide vaccination. For the first time, previously predicted CML tumor associated antigens for example Myeloperoxidase (10 peptide sequences on 7 CML patients) and Proteinase 3 (5 peptide sequences on 4 CML patients) were here confirmed by direct elution from primary CML cells, which also served to validate our methodological approach. Notably, beyond that we also identified a vast array of novel proteins (e.g. Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 8, CEACAM8; Matrix metallopeptidase 8, MMP8; intracellular adhesion molecule 3, ICAM3) that are broadly and exclusively represented in the ligandome of CML cells. By providing for the first time HLA class I tumor associated antigens, directly obtained from the HLA ligandomes of CML patients, this study may pave the way for the future development of a multipeptide-based immunotherapy approach to eradicate residual CML cells after conventional TKI therapy.
