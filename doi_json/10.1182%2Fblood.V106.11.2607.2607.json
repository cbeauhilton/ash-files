    "abstract_text": "The proteasome is a novel target in the therapeutic approach against different subtypes of lymphomas due to its role in the degradation of many proteins involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis. This multi-enzyme complex controls gene expression by degrading transcription factors such as NF- k B, p53, c-Jun, c-Myc, HIFla, and MATa2. Among these, the best characterized is the NF k B family of transcription factors. Mammals express five NF k B proteins including REL-A (p65), c-REL, REL-B, p50 and p52. All NF k B proteins contain a highly conserved REL-homology domain (RHD), which is responsible for DNA binding, dimerization, nuclear translocation, and interaction with the I k B proteins. Active NF k B is present in the nucleus as heterodimers of p65 and p50 or p52 and REL-B subunits. In contrast, inactive NF k B dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm due to their interaction with inhibitory proteins such as the I k B\u2019s or the large NF k B subunits p105 and p100. Activation of the NF k B pathway is mediated by proteasome processing of p105 and p100 to produce p50 and p52, respectively, and proteasome degradation of the I k B proteins. Therefore, the proteasome plays a central role in the equilibrium between anti-apoptotic signals derived from p50 and p52, and the NF k B inhibitory signals of p105 and p100. However, it is still undetermined whether modulation of the inhibitory signals or the anti-apoptotic signals by proteasome inhibition is more important for the induction of apoptosis in lymphomas. To address this question we tested the apoptotic effect of the proteasome inhibitor PS341 in two lymphoma cell lines (Daudi and SC) after knocking down p105 and/or p100, using lentivirus expressing siRNA\u2019s. After 24 hours of treatment with titration doses of PS341 (5, 10, 50, and 100nM), we measured apoptosis and NF k B inhibition by Annexin V-Alexa fluorescence and an NF k B luciferase reporter assay, respectively. Interestingly, co-expression of siRNA against both p100 and p105 rendered cells resistant to the induction of apoptosis at clinical doses of PS341 (5 and 10nM) compared to the controls (see table). Similar results were obtained after selective knock down of either p105 or p100. Western Blot analysis showed much lower accumulation of p105 and p100 in siRNA expressing cells than in control cells. However, I k B levels remain stable or increase during treatment in the p105 and/or p100 siRNA expressing cells, despite the observed reduction in apoptosis. These results suggest that the accumulation of p105 and p100, rather than I k B, contributes to the induction of apoptosis. In addition, the expression of NF k B anti-apoptotic signals, such as BCL-xL, increased in all cell lines, including controls. Therefore, the presence of anti-apoptotic signals has no impact on the apoptotic effect produced by PS341. In conclusion, the current study in our lymphoma model demonstrates that the accumulation of p105 and p100 is essential for the induction of apoptosis produced by proteasome inhibition. siRNA Against p100 and/or p105 Reduces PS341 Induction of Apoptosis   ps314(nM) 5 10 50 100 SC Luciferase siRNA 61.2\u00b13.2 70\u00b13.6 72.5\u00b13.6 79.5\u00b15  Both siRNA\u2019s 23.5\u00b11.5 33\u00b12.9 59.2\u00b13.9 72.1\u00b15.7  p100 siRNA 27.2\u00b10.4 29\u00b10.5 56\u00b12.7 66.3\u00b16.3  p105siRNA 32.2\u00b17.3 45\u00b12.4 55.4\u00b17.7 78.4\u00b14.1 DAUDI Luciferase siRNA 45.6\u00b13.3 49.5\u00b15.1 61.5\u00b17.1 69.9\u00b15   Both siRNA\u2019s 21.4\u00b14.6 29.3\u00b11.7 34.5\u00b12.4 55.3\u00b17.7  p100 siRNA 17.3\u00b14.2 24.4\u00b19.9 44.5\u00b13.3 56.6\u00b14.7  p105 siRNA 19.7\u00b11.6 34.3\u00b13.3 31.3\u00b12.6 46.3\u00b13.4  ps314(nM) 5 10 50 100 SC Luciferase siRNA 61.2\u00b13.2 70\u00b13.6 72.5\u00b13.6 79.5\u00b15  Both siRNA\u2019s 23.5\u00b11.5 33\u00b12.9 59.2\u00b13.9 72.1\u00b15.7  p100 siRNA 27.2\u00b10.4 29\u00b10.5 56\u00b12.7 66.3\u00b16.3  p105siRNA 32.2\u00b17.3 45\u00b12.4 55.4\u00b17.7 78.4\u00b14.1 DAUDI Luciferase siRNA 45.6\u00b13.3 49.5\u00b15.1 61.5\u00b17.1 69.9\u00b15   Both siRNA\u2019s 21.4\u00b14.6 29.3\u00b11.7 34.5\u00b12.4 55.3\u00b17.7  p100 siRNA 17.3\u00b14.2 24.4\u00b19.9 44.5\u00b13.3 56.6\u00b14.7  p105 siRNA 19.7\u00b11.6 34.3\u00b13.3 31.3\u00b12.6 46.3\u00b13.4 View Large"
