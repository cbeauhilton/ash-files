    "abstract_text": "FGFR3 is disregulated in approximately 15% of cases of multiple myeloma (MM) occurring by chromosomal translocation in the Igh switch region which results in the juxtaposition of FGFR3 next to the regulatory elements of the IgH locus, causing its ectopic expression in plasma cells. The acquisition of FGFR3 activating mutations in some tumors indicate a role for FGFR3 in tumor progression. In order to study its role in MM progression we developed a strain of transgenic mice in which the expression of the activated form of FGFR3 is mediated by isotype switch recombination by replacing the IgH gamma1 costant region with an FGFR3-IRES-EGFP cassette in a BAC that covers the entire murine IgH locus. We predict that in the transgenic mice B cells that undergo switch recombination to g1 on the productive allele will also undergo switch recombination to g1 at the transgenic locus and express FGFR3 and EGFP. To evaluate FGFR3 expression in vitro, we collected splenocytes from our transgenic mice and induced their proliferation and differentiation to plasma cells (mainly IgG1) using LPS and IL4. After four days of stimulation, the average number of EGFP positive cells went from 0.2% to 80%. We then analyzed FGFR3 expression by RT PCR, Northern and Western blot and detected LPS/IL4 inducible FGFR3 expression in plasma cells mediated mainly by the Igamma1 promoter and in a subset of them by the Vh promoter. We then tested if forced FGFR3 expression in B cells would affect their proliferation rate and ability to differentiate in vitro by MTT assay, cell cycle analysis and PI staining on LPS/IL4 stimulated splenocytes at different time points. With this system, we did not observe any FGFR3 mediated alteration of splenocytes growth parameters when compared to wild type controls. Similarly, in vivo no monoclonal gammopathy has been observed by serum protein electrophoresis and all the transgenic mice remaine tumor free at 1.5 years. Although we have not been able to demonstrate a tumorigenic role for FGFR3 in switched plasmacells we were able to obtaine regulated FGFR3 expression in them. It is possible that FGFR3 expression alone is not sufficient to induce plasma cells transformation and that FGFR3 has a dispensable role in tumor initiation, but that it could still play a role in tumor progression. Consistently, FGFR3 expression is lost in about 25% of multiple myeloma wih a t(4;14). To address this hypotesis we are currently crossing these mice with MMSET (the other gene disregulated in the t(4;14)) transgenic mice to investigate a possible collaborative role between these two genes in the development of MM."
