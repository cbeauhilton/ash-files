    "abstract_text": "Abstract 710 Background: Pediatric cohort studies in previously untreated [PUPs] children with hemophilia A [HA] identified potential risk factors for clinical meaningful inhibitor development [IH], among them HA severity < 1%, high risk gene mutations [HRS], high dose FVIII replacement therapy [HD] and use of recombinant FVIII concentrates [rFVIII]. The aim of the present study was to develop a simple score to rate inhibitor development in HA children. Patients and methods: 184 consecutively ascertained PUPs [enrollment between 1982 and 2008] with HA [severity < 5%] followed over a period of 200 exposure days were randomly selected into two groups [G1; G2] of 92 patients each. Three variables [HRS: 2 points], [HD: median single dose > 30 IU/kgbw within 8 to 12 weeks after therapy start] and [rFVIII] 1 point each, were incorporated into a risk assessment model, which was i ) evaluated in patient group G1 [pilot cohort: patients not included in the CANAL study] and ii ) validated in the second group [G2: confirmation cohort]. The risk discrimination cut-off was calculated using two independent statistical methods [ROC-analysis: MedCalc 11.0.0; CART regression tree: CART 6.0]. In addition, model specific cumulative IH-free survival [Cox regression analysis: hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI)], negative predictive values [NPV], sensitivity and specificity were calculated. In Cox regression analysis adjustment was performed for i ) age at first symptomatic bleed [proxy for early start of prophylaxis], ii ) severity of factor VIII-deficiency, and iii ) for treatment periods [1982-2008: divided into 3 to 5 year intervals]. Results: The risk discrimination cut-off in the pilot cohort G1 was calculated as \u201c2\u201d. Model sensitivity was 78.8 % and specificity was 49.8% respectively. In the confirmation cohort G2 seventeen children with HA developed a high responding IH [18.5%]: 16 out of 52 in children with a risk score > 2 [30.8%] and one out of 40 with a risk score < 2 [2.5%: p 2 was significantly reduced with an adjusted HR [CI] of 11.2 [1.5-83.5]. The corresponding NPV to rule out a high responding IH development in the confirmation cohort was 92% [80.5-98.5]. Conclusion: The model is able to rule out the development of high responding IH in white children with HA < 5% with good discriminative ability. Thus the model can be instrumental to individualize treatment strategies in HA patients. The score needs to be validated in other populations to test its generalizability.
