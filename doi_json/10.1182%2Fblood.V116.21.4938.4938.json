    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4938 Introduction: Dasatinib 100 mg once daily (QD) has superior efficacy compared with imatinib in patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP, as demonstrated by a randomized phase 3 trial in this setting (CA180-056/DASISION; Kantarjian et al, N Engl J Med 2010;362:2260-70). Exposure-efficacy response was characterized by examining the relationship between weighted time-averaged dasatinib concentration (wC avg ) and the probability of achieving a confirmed complete cytogenetic response (cCCyR; defined as CCyR detected in 2 consecutive assessments), the primary endpoint of DASISION. Exposure-safety response was characterized by describing the relationship between dasatinib trough concentration (C min ) and occurrence of pleural effusion in DASISION. Methods: wC avg and C min were determined by a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model that described concentration-time data from 235 subjects in DASISION. wC avg was calculated within the treatment duration up to the time of cCCyR or discontinuation (whichever occurred earlier) excluding dose interruptions. The probability of cCCyR was described by a logistic regression model with respect to C avg and the following covariates as predictors: cumulative duration of dose interruption (calculated as a percentage of the overall treatment duration [P intr ] until cCCyR or discontinuation, whichever occurred earlier), age, gender, and race. The relationship of C min to the hazard of pleural effusion (any grade) was characterized using a Cox proportional-hazards model that also examined the following covariates: age, gender, race, history of cardiac disease, and dasatinib treatment status (first line/after prior imatinib). Results: Concentration-time data for dasatinib were described by a linear two-compartment PPK model with first-order absorption. No statistically significant or clinically relevant differences in dasatinib PK were found between patients with newly diagnosed disease or those with prior imatinib therapy. Within the limited range of exposure produced by dasatinib 100 mg QD treatment and measured in the analysis dataset, the probability of achieving cCCyR in patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP was similar irrespective of dasatinib wC avg : high rates of cCCyR (>70% by 12 months) were observed across the exposure range. The probability of cCCyR decreased by 14% for each doubling in duration of dose interruption (P intr ; p<0.01). Among analyzed patients, pleural effusion (any grade) was reported in 10% of patients at 1 year in the DASISION trial. The risk of pleural effusion increased with dasatinib steady-state C min (hazard ratio of 1.1 for every unit increase of C min ; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04\u20131.17; p<0.01) and age (hazard ratio of 2.01 for every decade increase in life; 95% CI: 1.73\u20132.34; p<0.01). Conclusions: These analyses show that the probability of cCCyR in patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP was similarly high across the exposure range/wC avg produced by dasatinib 100 mg QD treatment. C min and age are associated with the risk of pleural effusion.  Analysis . Predictor . Median (5th\u201395th percentiles) . Odds/hazard ratio coefficient (95% CI) . P-value .

CCyR coefficients are with respect to log 2 of predictor variable; log 2 P intr increases by 1 unit for each doubling in value. Pleural effusion coefficients are with respect to C min and age/10; age/10 coefficient increases by 1 unit for each additional 10 years. Disclosures: Wang: Bristol-Myers Squibb: Employment.
