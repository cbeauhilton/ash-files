    "abstract_text": "Adult, Philadelphia chromosome-positive, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Ph-positive ALL) had a poor prognosis, but with the use of an initial BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor such as Dasatinib in conjunction with chemotherapy such as hyper-CVAD, the projected 24 month disease free survival is 64%. More recently Foa et al. on behalf of the GIMEMA investigators published a phase II trial of Dasatinib and Blinatumomab as initial therapy for adults with ALL. The complete remission rate was 98%, and the projected disease-free survival at 24 months is 88%. We wished to analyze the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the Dasatinib and Blinatumomab therapy as compared to Dasatinib and hyper-CVAD. The comparison is based on retail costs of chemotherapy for Dasatinib, Blinatumomab and hyperCVAD and excluded hospital and outpatient charges. The cost of hyperCVAD is based on treatment of a person with a BSA I.8m2. The retail cost of therapy is shown below. Drug  Dose  Cost Dasatinib 100 mg $505.67 Blinatumomab 1 mg $126.81 Cyclophosphamide 1,000 mg $231.00 Mesna 1,000 mg $42.89 Vincristine 2 mg $18.52 Dexamethasone 40 mg $4.12 Cytarabine 100 mg $22.88 Leucovorin 25 mg $7.48 The ICER formula is the cost of new therapy minus ( - ) the cost of standard therapy/quality of adjusted life new therapy - the quality of adjusted life standard (QALY). The yearly cost of Hyper-CVAD and Dasatinib is $147,288.48 per QALY, whereas, the yearly cost of Dasatinib-Blinatumomab is $187,940.46 per QALY. The difference is $42,451.98 which is less than the 50,000-threshold using cost-effective analysis. In conclusion, the combination of Dasatinib-Blinatumomab appears to be cost effective.
