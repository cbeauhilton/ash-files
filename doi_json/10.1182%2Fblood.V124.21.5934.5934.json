    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Myelofibrosis (MF), chronic myeloid malignancy associated with shortened survival, in majority of patients develops de novo as Primary MF, but also polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocythemia (ET) may progress into post-PV or post-ET MF. Although management of MF includes several treatment options, the only potentially curative treatment approach in MF is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Aim of this study was to evaluate the results of allo-HSCT in patients with MF treated in Katowice, Poland. Material and Methods: 27 pts (14 male and 13 female) with median age 51 years (range 21\u201363) were treated with allo-HCT due to PMF (20), post-PV (4) or post-ET (3) MF. 11,7,11,26 and 41% of pts had DIPSS 0,1,2,3 and 4, respectively. Median bone marrow cellularity was 70% (10-100%), fibrosis was collagen-type (14 pts including 2 with osteosclerosis), reticulin (10) or it was not specified (3). Splenomegaly was present in all pts: 13-20 cm (14 pts), > 20 cm (13 pts). JAK2V617F point mutation was present in 18 pts. Karyotype was available in 14 pts: in 9 normal, in 5 with variable abnormalities. Median time from diagnosis to allo-HCT was 1.5 (0.4\u20139.5) years. 16 pts (59.3%) received cells from HLA-matched related donor (MRD), 11 pts (40.7%) from unrelated donor: 10/10 (9) or 9/10 (2) HLA-A,B,C,DR,DQ alleles matched. Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) was used in 26 pts, 1 patient received myeloablative conditioning (MC). Sources of stem cells were: peripheral blood (21), bone marrow (4) and both (2). All pts but one had chronic phase of MF at time of transplantation. Results: 14/27 (52%) pts are alive at median 3.4 (0.4-5.4) years after allo-HSCT: 11/16(69%) from MRD and 3/11(27%) from MUD, p=0.032. Graft failure, graft loss or PRCA were observed in 3, 5 and 1 pt, respectively. Absolute neutrophil count >0.5\u00d710 9 /L and platelet count >50\u00d710 9 /L were achieved at median 16 and 28 days, respectively. 12/27 (44%) pts reached complete blood count of Hb>10 g/dl, Plt>100 G/l and WBC>3.5 G/l; 11 of them (92%) are alive. 6/27 (22%) pts remained either RBC or PLT transfusions dependent post-transplant; 3 of them (50%) died. 9/27 (33%) pts remained both RBC and PLT transfusion dependent and all of them died. JAK2V617F mutation was completely eradicated in 11/16 evaluated previously positive patients (69%), decreased in 4 (25%) and stable in 1(6%) pt. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) III-IV developed in 5/27 (19%) and extensive chronic GVHD in 5/19 (26%) pts. Relapse occurred in 4 pts and was treated with subsequent second transplant (in 1 pt thereafter by 3-rd allo-HSCT). Spleen length decreased at median by 5 (0.3-9.2) cm. Out of 7 pts with initial collagen fibrosis who were evaluated post-transplant, 1 had no fibrosis, 5 reticulin type and only in 1 pt collagen fibrosis was stable. Out of 3 pts with initial reticulin fibrosis it disappeared in 2 and progressed to collagen type in 1. Causes of death were GVHD (5 pts: 3 aGVHD, 2 cGVHD) and pancytopenia with either infection (7 pts) or CNS hemorrhage (1 pt). Conclusions: Allo-HSCT, the only curative treatment of myelofibrosis, provides chance of long survival, regression of the disease (lower stage of fibrosis, JAK2V617F eradication) and improved quality of life (transfusion independency, decreased splenomegaly). Transfusion independency may indicate good outcome. Favorable results are observed after allo-HSCT from MRD. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
