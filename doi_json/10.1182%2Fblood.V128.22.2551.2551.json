    "abstract_text": "Background: Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune heterogeneous disorder that Treg cells were numerically or functionally deficient 1-3 . It was shown that human FoxP3 + CD4 + T cells were composed of three phenotypically and functionally distinct subpopulations: CD45RA + FoxP3 lo resting Treg cells (rTreg cells, group I) and CD45RA - FoxP3 hi activated Treg cells (aTreg cells, group II), and CD45RA - FoxP3 lo non-suppressive Treg cells (group III) 4 . Our current study was aimed to determine whether the subtypes alterated in ITP patients or not. Methods: Ten healthy volunteers (normal contral, NC) and 15 newly diagnosed ITP patients (platelet below 30\u00d710 9 /L) donated 2mL peripheral blood to test the percentages of peripheral Treg cells subtypes by Flow Cytometry (FCM) before and after first-line glucocorticoid treatment. Among them, 10 NCs and 9 ITP patients donated additional 20mL peripheral before treatment for Treg cells subtypes functional study. CD4 + CD25 - Teffs and CD4 + CD25 + Tregs were purified. CD4 + CD25 - Teffs, labeled with CFSE, were cultured with Tregs for 5 days. Treg cells subtypes and their IL-10 fluorescence intensity were determined by FCM. Results: After treatment, 9 patients got complete or partial remission (ITP R), while the other 6 patiests were evaluated as non-remission (ITP NR). Before treatment, group I rTreg cells in ITP R pre ((11.77\u00b14.71)%, p =0.0048)or ITP NR pre ((10.30\u00b14.29)%, , p =0.0071) patients were both lower than NC (21.71\u00b17.61)%. As to group II aTreg cells, the percentage in ITP R pre (4.04\u00b12.09)% was higher than NC ((1.40\u00b10.69)%, p =0.0008) or ITP NR pre ((2.17\u00b10.78)%, p =0.0339), and there was no statistic difference between NC and ITP NR pre ( p =0.0652). The non-suppressive group III Treg cells was higher in ITP R pre ((84.07\u00b14.93)%, p =0.0185) and ITP NR pre ((84.25\u00b17.92)%, p =0.0090), when compared to NC (75.82\u00b17.83)%. After treatment, the subtypes in ITP R (ITP R post) were group I (14.69\u00b15.74)%, group II (4.18\u00b12.67)%, and group III (81.01\u00b15.66)%, none of them had statistic difference when compared with ITP R pre. In the term of ITP NR patients, the treatment also didn't change the subtypes alteration (group I (10.41\u00b16.16)%, group II (2.69\u00b12.09)%, and group III (86.71\u00b15.25)% in ITP NR post). In the co-culture study, ITP patients' Treg cells subtypes altered in the same pattern. That is decreased group I (NC (21.67\u00b110.71)%, ITP (8.94\u00b18.38), p =0.0222), increased group II (NC (7.94\u00b13.49)%, ITP (13.89\u00b17.13)%, p =0.0327), and increased group III (NC (59.9\u00b114.37)%, ITP (77.17\u00b19.31)%, p =0.0330). When we looked into the IL-10 producing capacity (represented by the mean fluorescence intensity, MFI) of each subtypes, the group II Tregs cells produced the most IL-10 in NC (group I (636.5\u00b1378.8), group II (3012.0\u00b13165.3), and group III (834.3\u00b11365.4), p =0.0463) as well as ITP (group I (385.5\u00b1416.9), group II (3934.6\u00b13633.3), and group III (556.0\u00b1416.6), p =0.0007). However, there were no statistic difference between NC and ITP in terms of IL-10 MFI. Conclusions: Tregs cells subtypes percentage altered when ITP occurred. The increased group II aTreg cells may forecast the better glucocorticoid treatment efficacy. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
