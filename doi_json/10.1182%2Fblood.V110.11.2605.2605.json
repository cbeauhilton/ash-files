    "abstract_text": "Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily and mediate their effects mainly through the Smad signaling pathway. TGF-\u03b2 is one of the most potent negative regulators in hematopoietic cells, and many cancers develop reduced sensitivity towards TGF-\u03b2 induced growth inhibition by several mechanisms, including functional loss of TGF-\u03b2 receptors and Smad proteins. We have previously shown that BMP-6 inhibits the growth of normal peripheral blood B cells. As high BMP-6 mRNA expression is associated with poor outcome in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL; Rosenwald et al, N Engl J Med 2002), we hypothesized that reduced sensitivity towards BMP-induced growth inhibition might contribute to lymphomagenesis. In the current study, 10 B lymphoma cell lines (representing Burkitt, DLBCL and FL) and tumor material from lymphoma patients were investigated to unravel the role of BMPs in lymphomas. We found that 5 \u2013 7 out of 10 lymphoma cell lines were resistant towards BMP-2, -4, -6 and -7 induced growth inhibition. In comparison, only 3 of the cell lines were resistant towards TGF-\u03b2. Analysis of BMP receptor expression by FACS analysis showed that all lymphoma cell lines and the malignant B cells from primary lymphoma biopsies expressed the BMPR type I Alk-2, whereas the expression of Alk-3 and Alk-6 was variable. Interestingly, the expression of BMPRII was low or undetectable in BMP-6 resistant cell lines, whereas it was highly expressed in 3 out of 4 sensitive cell lines. Also, malignant B cells from lymphoma biopsies showed reduced levels of BMPRII, suggesting that downregulation of BMPRII is a mechanism for evading BMP induced growth inhibition. Interestingly, upregulation of Smad6 or Smad7 was seen in 3 of the BMP-6 resistant cell lines and might represent another way of escaping the inhibitory effects of BMP. The lymphoma cell lines were investigated for endogenous production of BMPs by real-time RT-PCR, and 2 out of 10 cell lines had detectable BMP-6 mRNA, whereas 7 cell lines expressed BMP-7 mRNA. Analysis of purified malignant B cells or normal tumor infiltrating T cells from patient biopsies, confirmed the expression of BMP-6 and BMP-7 in the malignant B cells. Altogether, the data suggest that escape from BMP induced growth inhibition might contribute to increased tumor growth in B cell lymphomas."
