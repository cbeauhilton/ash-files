Recently we published a study showing that in a Brazilian population, plasma levels of FVIII over 180U/dl and VWF over 165U/dl were associated with the occurrence of venous thrombosis (odds ratio = 4.1 and 3.8 respectively) (Mello TB et al, 2009). The level of VWF in plasma and consequently FVIII is the result of genetic and acquired factors. ADAMTS13 ( A D isintegrin A nd M etalloprotease with T hrombo s pondin type 1 repeats) is an enzyme responsible for cleavage of VWF, and its activity could contribute to VWF and FVIII plasmatic levels in patients with DVT. Objective To evaluate the activity of ADAMTS13 in patients with DVT associated with an increase of VWF and FVIII. Patients and methods: Fifty-six patients with FVIII > 180U/dl or FVW>165U/dl were selected from a cohort of 175 patients with DVT from the study mentioned above. Fifty-four normal subjects were selected as controls. The activity of ADAMTS 13 was performed by binding of residual VWF to collagen; VWF activity was measured by collagen binding, VWF antigen was determined by ELISA and FVIII was measured by a one-stage coagulation assay. Continuous variables were analyzed by Mann-whitney test and categorical variables by the Chi-square test. Results The demographic distribution of patients and controls were similar. Among the 56 patients the median age was 37.5 years, 39 were women, 46 had blood typing \u201cnon-O\u201d, 34 had DVT caused by transient risk factor, especially the use of oral contraceptives, 10 patients had a hereditary thrombophilia and 3 were carriers of antiphospholipid antibodies. No patient had renal, hepatic or malignant disease. The median ADAMTS 13 activity was significantly lower in patients (112.9%, 44.4 - 327.6%) when compared to controls (142.9%, 76.7 - 323.6%), P = 0.001. The VWF activity was also higher in patients (109.7%, 26.8 - 422.6%) when compared to controls, (79.1%, 45.5 - 203.8%), P=0.038. The median level of VWF antigen was significantly higher in the group of patients when compared to the control group (178.1U/dl versus 111.9 U/dl respectively, P <0.0001). There was an inverse correlation between ADAMTS13 activity and VWF activity. Conclusion: This study suggests that the increased VWF and FVIII activity in patients with DVT can be a result of decreased ADAMTS13 activity. The decreased activity of ADAMTS13 may be influenced by the action of cytokines in inflammatory processes, even after acute period. Future studies will be important to determine the correlation between activity of ADAMTS 13, VWF, and inflammatory markers in the pathogenesis of DVT.
