    "abstract_text": "Introduction: It has been previously reported that pegylated interferon alpha-2a can induce hematologic and molecular responses in patients with essential thrombocythemia \"ET\" and polycythemia vera \"PV\", but the follow up in these studies were relatively short. Objective: We present longer-term efficacy and safety results of a prospective phase II study of pegylated interferon alpha-2a in patients with ET and PV after a median follow up of 82.5 months (range, 8-107). Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of ET or PV, in a need of therapy, either newly diagnosed or previously treated, were eligible for this study. Median interferon starting dose of 180 mcg/week SQ (range, 450-90; 39% started on 90mcg/week) was modified in majority of the patients based on toxicity or lack of efficacy. Clinical and molecular responses were assessed every 3 to 6 months. Results: Among 83 enrolled patients (43 PV, 40 ET), 32 patients (39%) are still on study (but in 8 therapy is on hold: 5 due to toxicity, and 3 for financial reasons). Median age was 53 years (range, 19-78). Overall 37% of patients did not receive prior cytoreductive treatment. The overall median exposure to therapy was 87 months (range, 58-107) and was no different for patients still enrolled on the study and those who stopped study participation. Nine (28%) patients still on study are currently on a dose equal or higher than 90 mcg/week and 15 (47%) are on dose equal or smaller than 45mcg/week. JAK2 status or allele burden had no impact on achievement of response (clinical or molecular), time to response or duration of therapy. 55 of 59 (71%) JAK2V617F positive patients were evaluable for molecular response (Figure); 8 patients carried CARL mutation, 3 carried MPL and in 13 were triple negative. Median duration of hematologic and molecular response was 66 and 53 months, respectively; and directly correlated with treatment length and type of response (CMR had the longest duration of response). Overall yearly discontinuation rate were gradually decreasing for first 5 years, from 17% to 5%, and slowly increasing afterward to 10%. Of the 51 patients not on the study anymore, 27 (35% of the total) discontinued therapy primarily due to treatment toxicity. New late (\u226524 months from start of therapy) G3/4 toxicity occurred in 17% of patients. Among patients in complete hematologic response treatment failure due to vascular adverse event or disease transformation was seen in 5 patients each. Three patients died on study (not related to therapy or disease), and 8 after stopping participation. Mean changes in allele burden over time in JAK2 positive patients are depicted in figure. Conclusions: Although pegylated interferon alpha-2a can induce significant hematologic and molecular responses; toxicity still limits its use over longer period of time and loss of response or transformation is encountered.
