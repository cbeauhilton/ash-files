    "abstract_text": "Wilms tumor protein (WT1) is a transcription factor selectively over expressed in several types of leukemia and solid tumors, making it a promising potential target antigen for immunotherapy. Several open clinical trials use native or altered peptide sequences derived from the WT1 protein in order to overcome the weak immunogenicity of the self-antigen. Here we report a new strategy to circumvent tolerance by designing peptides that incorporate non-natural amino acids into the native sequence of WT1 peptides. Starting from the nonamer sequences WT1 187\u2013195 and WT1 235\u2013243, eight peptides containing natural amino acids and nine peptides in which different chemical modifications (fluorination, photo-reactive azido groups or benzophenone groups) were introduced at major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and T cell receptor binding positions, were synthesized. The new non-natural peptides could stabilize MHC class I molecules better than the native sequences and were also able to elicit strong specific T-cell responses. Photo-reactive peptides were additionally modified with biotin handles to allow streptavidin-biotin pull down and western blot analysis of kinetics of binding and catabolism. Upon UV irradiation, these peptides covalently bound to MHC molecules on the live cells; clearance of the peptide-MHC covalent complex occurred over 24 hours, consistent with the T2 thermo-stabilization data for the same peptide. Further catabolic studies may elucidate the important or novel cellular proteins involved in antigenic peptide processing and cross presentation and should aid in vaccine development. We are investigating whether covalent interaction with the MHC may lead to alterations in immune responses as well. T cells stimulated with one of the synthetic peptides (WT1J-W4W F ) cross-reacted with the native WT1J sequence and were able to kill WT1 positive HLA-A0201 matched acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. In conclusion, this study shows that peptides with non-natural amino acids can be successfully incorporated into T cell epitopes to provide increased immunogenicity and novel biological information."
