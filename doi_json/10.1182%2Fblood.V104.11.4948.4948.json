    "abstract_text": "Objective Because of the central role of the transcription factor nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) in cell survival and proliferation in many kinds of cancer cells, NF-\u03baB inhibitor may have a potential role in the therapy of cancer. Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is one of the most common complications following stem cells transplantation. Some data report that CMV infection has a very close relation with NF-\u03baB activation. But it is unknown what effect of NF-\u03baB inhibitor pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PTDC) on the infection and activation of cytomegalovirus in mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs). Methods MSCs were infected by 1 TCID 50 of CMV combined with/without 1\u03bcmol/L of PTDC. After 48h of culture with DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, MSCs shapes were observed. RT-PCR assay was used to detect the mRNA expression of CMV immediate early (IE) gene and GAPDH gene. Flow Cytometry was used to detect the CMV PP65 antigen positive cells. Results Shape of some MSCs changed after the infection of 1 TCID 50 of CMV. But in MSCs infected by 1 TCID 50 of CMV combined with 1\u03bcmol/L of PTDC, Cell shape changed more dominantly, almost all cells changed from thin shuttle shape to round and thick ball shape. While in the cells treated only with PDTC, shape of the cells did not changed. RT-PCR assay showed that there was a very bright band of CMV IE mRNA in MSCs infected by 1 TCID 50 of CMV combined with 1\u03bcmol/L of PTDC compared with the cells infected only with 1 TCID 50 of CMV. More CMV pp65 antigen positive cells were found in MSCs infected by 1 TCID 50 of CMV combined with 1\u03bcmol/L of PTDC with Flow Cytometry. Conclusion NF-\u03baB activation may affect CMV infection of cells. NF-\u03baB inhibitor PTDC can increase the infection and activation of CMV in MSCs and we should pay more attention to CMV infection when we use NF-\u03baB inhibitor in clinical work.."
