    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (pHLH) is a rare, genetic life-threatening syndrome characterized by hyper-inflammation that is mainly driven by high production of interferon (IFN)-\ud835\udefe, leading to the development of fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias and coagulopathy. There are currently no approved treatments for HLH, and recent attempts to improve the dexamethasone/etoposide-based regimen (HLH-94) did not show a significant improvement in overall probability of survival. Emapalumab (NI-0501) is a fully human, anti-IFN-\ud835\udefe monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralizes IFN-\ud835\udefe and is in development for treatment of HLH. Methods : This open-label pivotal study (NCT01818492) includes patients \u226418 years with a diagnosis of pHLH based on genetic confirmation, family history, or the presence of \u22655 of the 8 HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria. Patients were either treatment-na\u00efve or had failed previous conventional HLH therapy prior to study entry. The emapalumab initial dose was 1 mg/kg given intravenously every 3-4 days. Subsequent doses could be increased up to 10 mg/kg based on the evolution of clinical and laboratory response parameters. Emapalumab was administered concomitantly with 5 to10 mg/m 2 /day of dexamethasone which could be tapered during the study. Treatment duration was 8 weeks (with possible shortening to a minimum of 4 weeks). Treatment could be extended up to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) whenever needed. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was overall response at end of treatment assessed by pre-defined objective parameters. Overall Response Rate (ORR) was assessed as normalization or at least 50% improvement from baseline of fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, hyperferritinemia, fibrogen and/or D-Dimer levels, central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities, with no sustained worsening of sCD25 serum levels. The primary analysis used an exact binomial test to evaluate the null hypothesis that ORR be at most 40% at a one-sided 0.025 significance level. Data presented are from 34 patients of whom 27 entered the study after failing conventional HLH therapy. Following completion of the main study patients entered into an extension phase (NCT02069899). The data cut-off applied is July 20 2017. Results : Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Disease presentation at study entry was consistent with the broad spectrum of pHLH abnormalities, both in terms of HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria and other known HLH features; over 30% of patients had signs and/or symptoms of CNS disease. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 2. ORR was significantly higher than the pre-specified null hypothesis of 40%; thus the primary endpoint was met. The response rate based on investigator's clinical judgement was 70.6% and 70.4% in the two groups. Emapalumab infusions were in general well tolerated, with mild to moderate infusion-related reactions reported in 27% of patients. The observed safety events pre-HSCT conditioning mostly included HLH manifestations, infections or toxicities due to other administered drugs. Infections caused by pathogens potentially favored by IFN-\ud835\udefe neutralization occurred in 1 patient during emapalumab treatment (Disseminated histoplasmosis), and resolved with appropriate treatment. No off-target effects were observed. Conclusions : This is the first prospective HLH study that reports response rates based on pre-defined objective criteria. Our results indicate that emapalumab should be considered as a new therapeutic option in pHLH thanks to its targeted mode of action. Treatment with emapalumab was able to control HLH activity with a favorable safety and tolerability profile in a very fragile population. The majority of patients proceeded to HSCT with favorable outcome.
