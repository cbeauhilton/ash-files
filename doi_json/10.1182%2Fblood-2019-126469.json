    "abstract_text": "Introduction N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) RNA methylation is the most abundant epitranscriptomic modification, dynamically installed by the m 6 A methyltransferases (termed as \"writers\"), reverted by the demethylases (termed as \"erasers\"), and recognized by m 6 A binding proteins (termed as \"readers\"). Emerging evidence suggests that m 6 A RNA methylation regulates RNA stability, and participates in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases including cancers. Nevertheless, the role of m 6 A RNA methylation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains to be unveiled. Herein, we hypothesized that m 6 A RNA methylation contributed to the tumorigenesis and maintenance of CLL. Moreover, the risk-prediction model integrated with the m 6 A regulators could serve as a novel and effective prognostic indicator in CLL. This study aimed to identify robust m 6 A RNA methylation-associated fingerprints for risk stratification in patients with CLL. Methods A total of 714 de novo CLL patients from 4 cohorts (China, Spain, Germany and Italy) were enrolled with informed consents. EpiQuik m 6 A RNA methylation colorimetric quantification assay was utilized to assess m 6 A RNA methylation levels. LASSO Cox regression algorithm was performed to calculate m 6 A RNA methylation-associated risk score (short for \"m 6 A risk score\") in R software. Besides, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with log-rank test, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses and ROC curve analysis of overall survival (OS) were conduct to explore the prognostic value of m 6 A signature in CLL. Furthermore, RNA-seq, MeRIP-seq, Ribo-seq, functional enrichment analyses in silico and preclinical experiments ex vivo were applied to confirm the biological mechanism of the m 6 A regulators in CLL. Results In the present study, we performed a comprehensive analysis to dissect the role of m 6 A RNA methylation regulators in CLL. Compared with normal B cells from healthy donors, obvious decreased level of m 6 A RNA methylation was observed in primary CLL cells ( p <0.01; Figure 1A). In addition, down-regulated m 6 A RNA methylation was also detected in CLL cell lines MEC1 and EHEB ( p <0.05; Figure 1A). Then, we further investigated the association of the m 6 A RNA methylation regulators with clinical outcomes of CLL patients. By LASSO Cox regression analysis in 486 CLL patients, the m 6 A risk score was established with the coefficients of fourteen m 6 A regulators at the minimum lambda value of 0.00892 (Figure 1B-C). Based on the median risk score as the cut-off value, a clear distribution pattern was delineated in CLL patients (Figure 1D). Kaplan-Meier curves showed stratified high-risk patients presented significantly shorter OS versus the low-risk group (HR=4.477, p <0.001; Figure 2A). Besides, m 6 A risk score also predicts inferior prognosis in stable subgroup (HR=3.097, p =0.037; Figure 2B), and progressed/ relapsed subgroup (HR=3.325, p =0.001; Figure 2C). Moreover, univariate, multivariate cox regression analyses and ROC curve confirmed high m 6 A risk score as an independent survival predictor in CLL patients ( p <0.001; Figure 2D-E). Thereafter, the clinicopathological relevance and underlying mechanism of m 6 A risk score were explored. Significant elevated m 6 A risk score was detected in patients with unfavorable treatment responses compared with stable status ( p <0.001; Figure 3A). Furthermore, CLL patients with advanced Binet stage, positive ZAP-70 and unmutated IGHV present increased m 6 A risk score ( p <0.05; Figure 3B-C). Intriguingly, we also observed the significantly negative correlation between highrisk score and 13q14 deletion, in accordance with patients' inferior outcome ( p =0.047; Figure 3D). Moreover, Pearson correlation analysis, STRING interactive network and functional enrichment analyses deciphered that the m 6 A regulators exerted crucial roles in CLL progression potentially via modulating RNA metabolism and oncogenic pathways (Figure 4A-C). Conclusion To date, our study provides evidence for the first time that reduced m 6 A RNA methylation contributes to the tumorigenesis of CLL. Distinct m 6 A risk scoreis demonstrated as an efficient tool facilitating prognosis evaluation in CLL patients. However, validation of the signature in more independent cohorts are warranted. Further interrogations will be elucidated on the biological mechanism of m 6 A regulators, highlighting insights into pathogenesis and therapy strategy of CLL.
