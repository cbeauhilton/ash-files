It is of paramount importance to determine which children have serious bacterial infections in this vulnerable period. We studied the ability of interleukin 6 (IL-6), high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) and procalcitonin (PCT) to act as a sensitive diagnostic marker for bacterial sepsis in febrile neutropenic children and their utility as a predictive marker for serious infections. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. Patients: Sixty-two episodes in children (aged 5 months to 17 yrs) with a known malignancy/aplastic anemia who presented with fever and neutropenia. Interventions: Serial blood samples were obtained (admission, and 48 hrs), and concentrations of PCT, IL-6, TNF \u03b1 and hsCRP were determined. Demographic and laboratory data from the patients were collected from the medical records. Measurements and Main Results: Out of 62 episodes of febrile neutropenia, fifteen (24%) of the children had proven sepsis (13 positive blood cultures, 1 invasive aspergillosis and 1 local abscess with fever). Plasma levels of IL-6, hsCRP, TNF\u03b1 and PCT were increased at all time points in children with sepsis compared with those without sepsis. In culture positive patients the value of TNF-alpha was higher but statistically not significant. No major differences were found in hsCRP concentrations. IL-6 at 0 and 48 hrs were reliable markers for sepsis (area under the curve 0.73 and 0.77, respectively). Using cutoff values of IL-6 > 137.5 pg/mL at 0 hrs and >69 pg/mL at 48 hrs of admission produced a screening test for sepsis with 67% sensitivity, 75% specificity at 0 hrs and 75% sensitivity and 78% specificity at 48 hrs respectively. Also using the cutoff values of 1.73ng/ml for procalcitonin at 0 hrs was a good screening test with 73%sensitivity and 70% specificity. When IL-6 cutoff was brought down to 20pg/ml at 0 hr then sensitivity increased to 100%. 42/62 children with febrile neutropenia had IL6 >20 which included all 15 proven sepsis cases and all 6 deaths. Rest of 20 patients all had negative cultures and no deaths. PCT value of >1 ng/ml was seen in 39/62 and included 12 of 15 cases of proven sepsis. PCT was < 1ng/ml in a case of invasive aspergillosis and another case of candida line infection and a case of local abscess with fever. Conclusions: Our data shows the utility of a rapid and sensitive assay for interleukin-6 along with procalcitonin as a sensitive diagnostic marker of bacterial sepsis in febrile neutropenic children. The use of these markers as a clinical tool may allow for early discharge on oral antibiotics or no antibiotics in patients with IL6 less than 20 pg/ml and PCT less than 1 ng/ml.",
