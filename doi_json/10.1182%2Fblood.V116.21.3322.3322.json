Background Although adjunctive cilostazol intensifies platelet inhibition in AMI patients, it is not established whether this regimen can overcome the loss-of-function effect of CYP2C19 variants. Methods We randomly assigned 126 AMI patients with available CYP2C19 genotyping to receive adjunctive cilostazol (triple group; n = 64) or high maintenance-dose (MD) clopidogrel of 150-mg/day (high-MD group; n = 62). Using conventional aggregometry and VerifyNow, platelet reactivity was measured at pre-discharge and 30-day follow-up. Primary endpoint was change in maximal platelet aggregation (Agg max ). High post-treatment platelet reactivity (HPPR) was defined as 5 \u03bcmol/l ADP-induced Agg max > 50%. Results In non-carriers, the two groups did not differ with respect to changes in platelet measures, and could achieve fewer rates of HPPR at 30-day follow-up (< 5%). In carriers, changes in 5 and 20 \u03bcmol/l ADP-induced Agg max were significantly higher in the triple (n = 39) versus high-MD group (n = 38) (21.8 \u00b1 13.9% vs. 9.0 \u00b1 13.3%, p < 0.001, and 24.2 \u00b1 17.2% vs. 7.7 \u00b1 15.5%, p < 0.001, respectively). Likewise, changes in late platelet aggregation and P2Y 12 reaction unit were consistently greater in the triple vs. high-MD group. Fewer patients in the triple group met the criteria of HPPR at 30-day follow-up compared with the high-MD group (2.6% vs. 21.1%, p = 0.014). Conclusions Among AMI patients with CYP2C19 variants, adjunctive cilostazol enhances platelet inhibition and reduces the rate of HPPR, as compared with high-MD clopidogrel.
