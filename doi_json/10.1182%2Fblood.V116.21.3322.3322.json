    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3322 Objectives The aim of this study was to assess the degree of platelet inhibition by adjunctive cilostazol in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) according to CYP2C19 genotype. Background Although adjunctive cilostazol intensifies platelet inhibition in AMI patients, it is not established whether this regimen can overcome the loss-of-function effect of CYP2C19 variants. Methods We randomly assigned 126 AMI patients with available CYP2C19 genotyping to receive adjunctive cilostazol (triple group; n = 64) or high maintenance-dose (MD) clopidogrel of 150-mg/day (high-MD group; n = 62). Using conventional aggregometry and VerifyNow, platelet reactivity was measured at pre-discharge and 30-day follow-up. Primary endpoint was change in maximal platelet aggregation (Agg max ). High post-treatment platelet reactivity (HPPR) was defined as 5 \u03bcmol/l ADP-induced Agg max > 50%. Results In non-carriers, the two groups did not differ with respect to changes in platelet measures, and could achieve fewer rates of HPPR at 30-day follow-up (< 5%). In carriers, changes in 5 and 20 \u03bcmol/l ADP-induced Agg max were significantly higher in the triple (n = 39) versus high-MD group (n = 38) (21.8 \u00b1 13.9% vs. 9.0 \u00b1 13.3%, p < 0.001, and 24.2 \u00b1 17.2% vs. 7.7 \u00b1 15.5%, p < 0.001, respectively). Likewise, changes in late platelet aggregation and P2Y 12 reaction unit were consistently greater in the triple vs. high-MD group. Fewer patients in the triple group met the criteria of HPPR at 30-day follow-up compared with the high-MD group (2.6% vs. 21.1%, p = 0.014). Conclusions Among AMI patients with CYP2C19 variants, adjunctive cilostazol enhances platelet inhibition and reduces the rate of HPPR, as compared with high-MD clopidogrel.
