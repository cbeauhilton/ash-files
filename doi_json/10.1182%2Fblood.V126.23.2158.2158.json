    "abstract_text": "Background: Among patients with beta-thalassemia early detection of transfusion-induced myocardial iron loading and its intervention with aggressive chelation therapy may delay or reverse heart failure. Three dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (3D-STE) is a novel tool that may early detect myocardial affection in these patients. Methods: Thirty-two thalassemic patients with a mean age of 18.1\u00b1 7.03 years and 30 aged matched healthy control subjects have been included in the study. Patients have been recruited from pediatric hematology clinics in both Cairo University, Egypt (n=18) and Padova University, Italy (n=14). 3D-STE was performed to all patients and control subjects in addition to the myocardial relaxometry T2* by cardiac MRI. Results: The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) derived from 3D echocardiography among the studied thalassemia patients was within normal range 62.5\u00b1 5.6%. Compared to the normal subjects, thalassemia patients had a statistical significant reduction of the left ventricular global longitudinal strain (-16.81\u00b1 0.93% vs -18.76 \u00b1 1.12 %, p=0.001), the left ventricular global circumferential strain (-10.56 \u00b1 0.61% vs -11.83 \u00b1 0.71 %, p=0.001 ) and the left ventricular global area strain (-20.13 \u00b11.18% vs -22.48 \u00b1,1.29 %, p=0.001). No statistical significant correlation was found between the severity of myocardial iron overload measured by T2* and the measured left ventricular global strain. Conclusion: In asymptomatic thalassemia patients with preserved left ventricular global systolic function 3D-STE derived strain can detect early subtle myocardial dysfunction. The observed subtle myocardial deformation dysfunction is not related to the extent of myocardial iron deposition. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
