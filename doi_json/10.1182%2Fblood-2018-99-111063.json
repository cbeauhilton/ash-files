    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND : Mutations of internal tandem duplication in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ( FLT3 -ITD) contributed to poor prognosis in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib in combination with chemotherapy was applied to treat FLT3 -ITD AML patients with limited efficacy. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) was considered as a potent therapeutic regimen in FLT3 -ITD patients, but additional sorafenib maintenance was indispensable to support their long-term survival after allo-HSCT. Studies showed that increasing ITD size may be accompanied with decreasing OS and RFS in AML patients, but it remained controversial about the prognostic implication of ITD mutant lengths, the prognostic influence was important to evaluate in determining the therapeutic strategy for AML patients with different ITD lengths. METHODS: Total 185 CN-AML patients with and without FLT3 -ITD mutations were enrolled in this study. We retrospectively studied the clinical characteristic, treatment response, survival and relapse risk after chemotherapy or allo-HSCT plus sorafenib in these patients. Distribution of ITD lengths detected in AML patients suggested two groups including long (\u226570bp) and short ITD length (<70bp). Influence of FLT3 -ITD mutation and its length were investigated after chemotherapy or allo-HSCT plus sorafenib. RESULT: FLT3 -ITD mutations were detected in 15 percentage of AML patients, and associated with leukocytosis, high blast percentage in bone morrow (BM) and increased risk of treatment failure. FLT3 -ITD mutations indicated decreased complete remission (CR) rate, overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS), and increased relapse risk (RR) in AML patients after chemotherapy plus sorafenib. Patients with long ITD length (\u226570bp) had worse OS and RFS, and more relapse probability than these with short ITD length (< 0bp) or FLT3 -WT, but patients with short ITD length and FLT3 -WT had the similar RFS and RR after chemotherapy. Allo-HSCT plus sorafenib maintenance significantly prolonged OS and RFS, decreased RR in FLT3 -ITD patients, especially in these with long ITD length instead of those with short ITD length. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that FLT3 -ITD mutation and long ITD length had negative effect on treatment response and prognosis in CN-AML patients. Allo-HSCT plus sorafenib maintenance was an effective strategy to improve survival and decrease relapse probability, abrogated disadvantage from long ITD length in FLT3 -ITD patients.
