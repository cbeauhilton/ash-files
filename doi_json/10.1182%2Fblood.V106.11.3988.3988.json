    "abstract_text": "WinRho\u00ae SDF is licensed in the USA, Canada and Europe to treat ITP and prevent Rh isoimmunization. Although safe, efficacious and cost-effective, WinRho\u00ae SDF has only been available in a freeze-dried formulation. In order to simplify injection preparation and reduce the possibility of preparation errors, a liquid formulation of WinRho\u00ae SDF has been developed. The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of the liquid and freeze-dried preparations were compared in 2 randomized, double-blind, multi-center phase 1 studies that were conducted in healthy adult volunteers. Subjects were administered one of the formulations either IM (300 \u03bcg or 15 \u03bcg/kg) or IV (50 \u03bcg/kg). Pharmacokinetics (AUC, C max , t 1/2 , t max ) and safety data (adverse events and laboratory assessments) were assessed over 84 days. In total, 142 subjects received either the liquid or freeze-dried formulations (N=71 each group). Following IV or IM administration, the ratios (90% confidence intervals) for AUC and C max were within the FDA required acceptance range of 80\u2013125% to demonstrate bioequivalence. Both formulations had comparable half-lifes of ~18\u201319 days and ~26 days following IV or IM administration, respectively. While t max occurred immediately following IV administration, t max was ~3\u20137 days after IM administration. Both formulations were similarly tolerated following either IV or IM administration. The most common adverse events were headaches and neck/back pain. Liquid WinRho\u00ae SDF was demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the freeze-dried formulation following IV or IM administration. This suggests that liquid WinRho\u00ae SDF may be therapeutically equivalent to the freeze-dried formulation and provide a more convenient presentation for use.",
