    "abstract_text": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disease (LPD) is a serious complication following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In 86 patients undergoing HSCT in a single center we prospectively performed a quantitative EBV-specific polymerase chain reaction in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) weekly after HSCT. Cellular immune reconstitution was monitored by flow cytometric analysis on days 30 and 60 after transplantation. We observed an EBV reactivation (>10 3 EBV-genome copies/10 5 PBMC) only in patients who received antithymocyte globulin (ATG) for immunosuppression. 15 of 46 patients (33%) who received ATG experienced EBV reactivation. Interestingly, we found a similar incidence of EBV reactivation in 7 of 21 patients (33%) who received ATG (Fresenius) at a median total dose of 40 mg/kg and in 8 of 26 patients (31%) who received ATG (Sangstat) at a median total dose of 20 mg/kg. However, in patients with ATG (Fresenius) EBV reactivation was observed only in the range between 10 3 and 10 4 EBV-genome copies/10 5 PBMC and no EBV-associated LPD occurred. In contrast, in patients with ATG (Sangstat) EBV reactivation was always greater than 10 4 EBV-genome copies/10 5 PBMC. Median values for CD3+ cells were 157.7/\u03bcl versus 1.5/\u03bcl on day 30 and 327.0/\u03bcl versus 15.5/\u03bcl on day 60 in the group receiving ATG (Fresenius) or ATG (Sangstat), respectively. For CD3+CD4+ cells the corresponding numbers were 57.8/\u03bcl versus 0.5/\u03bcl on day 30 and 90.8/\u03bcl versus 10.0/\u03bcl on day 60. Median values for CD3+CD8+ cells were 89.4/\u03bcl versus 0.3/\u03bcl on day 30 and 237.3/\u03bcl versus 9.4/\u03bcl on day 60 in the group receiving ATG (Fresenius) or ATG (Sangstat), respectively. Patients with ATG (Sangstat) had significantly lower numbers of CD3+, CD3+CD4+, and CD3+CD8+ cells than patients with ATG (Fresenius) on day 30 ( P <.001) and day 60 ( P 10 4 EBV-genome copies/10 5 PBMC). In contrast, 79 patients who had a copy number lower than 10 4 EBV-genome copies/10 5 PBMC did not develop EBV-associated LPD ( P 10 4 EBV-genome copies/10 5 PBMC). Pre-emptive therapy was performed with a single dose of rituximab (375 mg/m 2 ) at a median of 52 days after HSCT. Following administration of rituximab a dramatic decrease of EBV-genome copies and B cells was observed. In all 3 patients no EBV-associated LPD occurred until 6 months after rituximab infusion. We conclude that in comparison to ATG (Fresenius) the use of ATG (Sangstat) as part of the conditioning regimen leads to a significant delay in T-cell reconstitution and to a significantly higher increase of EBV DNA load which predicts for EBV-associated LPD. Pre-emptive therapy with rituximab results in a dramatic decrease of EBV-genome copies and B cells and appears to be effective for preventing EBV-associated LPD.",
