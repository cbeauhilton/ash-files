    "abstract_text": "A phase I study of oral temozolomide, administered daily for 5 days every 28 days, was performed in children with relapsed or primary refractory leukemias. The starting dose was 200 mg/m 2 /day with subsequent dose escalation to 260 mg/m 2 /day. Ten patients (5 male, 5 female), median age 9 years (range: 1\u201318 years), with leukemia (6 with acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL], 4 with acute myelogenous leukemia [AML]) received a total of 14 cycles of temozolomide. Serum pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were obtained in 6 patients using a limited pharmacokinetic sampling strategy. Samples were also obtained from 8 patients for correlative biology studies, including analysis of methyl-guanine methyl transferase (MGMT) activity and microsatellite instability (MSI). MGMT activity was measured in 7 patients; all 3 patients with ALL tested for MGMT had elevated MGMT activity, with a median MGMT activity of 1240 fmol/mg protein (range: 356\u20131756). In contrast, 3 out of 4 patients with AML had MGMT activity below the limits of detection. Eight patients were tested for microsatellite instability by multiplex PCR using a panel of 13 MSI loci. Two patients (one with ALL and one with AML) demonstrated probable MSI instability. Temozolomide has been well tolerated, with no patients developing dose-limiting toxicity to date. One patient with AML, undetectable MGMT activity and no microsatellite instability had a partial response (PR) lasting 4 cycles (<10% myeloblasts in bone marrow). Further analysis is underway to determine the frequency of elevated MGMT activity in ALL and AML patients at diagnosis and following relapse."
