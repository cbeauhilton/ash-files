    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Despite the growing interest about the optimal treatment of older patients with cancer, only few data are available for indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of comorbidities on treatment choice and survival in a cohort of older indolent NHL patients. Material and Methods: In an IRB-approved protocol, we reviewed the records of 742 patients with age\u226560 years diagnosed of indolent NHL between January 1990 to December 2012 at our Center. Patients not receiving a treatment (N=177) and those treated with local therapy for stage I disease (N=138) were excluded from the analysis. Clinical information was gathered from the electronic charts, comorbidity was assessed using the cumulative illness rating scale-geriatrics (CIRS-G). Association between categorical variables was assessed with chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were the end-point of the study, defined respectively as the time from diagnosis to death or last visit and time to death or relapse/progression, which one occurred first, or last visit. Differences among groups in terms of OS and PFS were verified with both log-rank test in univariate setting and Cox proportional hazard model in multivariable analysis. Results: A total of 427 patients with a median follow-up of 4.04 years (range 0.1-20) were evaluated in the study. Patients were diagnosed as follicular NHL (n=207), marginal zone NHL (MALT N=93, splenic N=32, nodal N=38) and lymphocytic NHL (N=57). Median age was 69.9 years (range 60-93.9) with 11% of the patients older than 80 years, M/F ratio was 0.81. At least one comorbidity were present in 363 patients (85%), CIRS total score 2 was recorded in 161 patients (38%). At least one score 3-4 comorbidity was present in 176 (41%) and the most frequent categories involved were vascular (N=191, 45%), metabolic/endocrine/breast (N=102, 24%) and heart (N=71, 17%). Patients were further categorized in fit (N=224, 52%) or unfit/frail (N=203, 48%) on the basis of age (>80 years) and CIRS parameters (>1 grade 3-4 or >4 grade 2 categories). Patients categorized according these comorbidity scores were balanced for main clinical factors, with the exception of age. First line treatment was CHOP/CHOP-like (N=179, 42%), CVP (N=112, 26%), chlorambucil (N=104, 24%) or other (N=32, 7%) with the addition of rituximab in 53% of the cases. Severity index>2 (P=0.0146), presence of >1 score 3-4 category (P=0.0167) and frail/unfit status (P2 (P=0.0310), presence of >1 score 3-4 category (P=0.0239) and frail/unfit status (P<0.0001) independently influenced PFS as well as age, clinical advanced stage and rituximab use (Figure 1A). Overall survival was deeply influenced by age<80 (P=0.000), rituximab use (P=0.000) and frail/unfit status (P<0.0001, Figure 1B). Conclusions: Age and comorbidity scores influenced treatment intensity as well as the decision to add rituximab, this was associated to a significant impact on overall outcome of indolent NHL.
