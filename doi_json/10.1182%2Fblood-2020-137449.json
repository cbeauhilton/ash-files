    "abstract_text": "Objective:To evaluate the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of rituximab, fotemustine, pemetrexed and dexamethasone (R-FPD) regimen for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) patients. Methods:A prospective, single-center, single-arm, phase II clinical trial. Patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL diagnosed from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from July 2018 to July 2020. R-FPD regimen consisted of rituximab (375 mg/m2 i.v. on D0), fotemustine (100mg/m2 i.v. on D1) ,pemetrexed (600mg/m2 i.v. on D1), and dexamethasone (40 mg i.v. on D1).(NCT04083066) Results: 30 patients were included. After two cycles, the objective response rate(ORR) was 96.4%(27/28,26 PR,1 CR,0 SD,0 PD,2 Censored),the disease control rate(DCR) was 96.4%(27/28); After four cycles, the ORR was 71.4% (15/21, 5PR,10 CR,1SD,5PD,7NR,2 Censored),DCR was 76.2%(16/21). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 20.3 months (95%CI:5.2--35.4),The median overall survival (OS) was 22.0 months (95%CI:16.1-27.9).The grade III-IV toxicities were mainly leukopenia(17.9%), thrombocypenia(25%) and anemia(10.7%). Conclusion: Fotemustine-based in combination with Rituximab chemotherapy can improve outcomes with the progress free survival and the overall survival benefits, as well as with better tolerability for newly diagnosed PCNSL patients.
