    "abstract_text": "Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) are frequent malignancies with considerable mortality. A recurrent somatic and oncogenic driver mutation in the Toll-like receptor adaptor gene MYD88 , Leu265Pro (L265P) has been identified in up to 90% of certain NHL subtypes. Genetic alterations affecting a protein-coding region have the potential to generate mutation-derived peptides that are presented by HLA class I proteins and might be recognized by cytotoxic T cells. Because MYD88 L265P is a widely occurring and tumor-specific mutation, we investigated the potential of MYD88 L265P -containing peptides for CD8 + T cell mediated immunotherapy as a new therapeutic approach for MYD88 L265P+ NHL. Based on in silico prediction we identified potential HLA ligands encompassing the MYD88 L265P mutation for several HLA class I allotypes. Functional characterization of the candidate HLA class I MYD88 L265P -derived HLA class I ligands with regard to induction of T cell responses identified a set of immunogenic peptides for HLA-B*07 and -B*15. In one MYD88 L265P -mutated NHL patient, memory T cell responses targeting three different MYD88 L265P -derived HLA class I ligands were detected by IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT. Efficient T cell priming was demonstrated in vitro using na\u00efve T cells of healthy volunteers (HVs). In detail, three HLA-B*07 peptides (P1-3 B*07 ) and one HLA-B*15-restricted peptide (P4 B*15 ) were analyzed using artificial antigen-presenting cell-based (aAPC) in vitro priming experiments in three to six HVs, respectively. For all tested peptides proliferation of peptide-specific CD8 + T cells could be detected after in vitro priming. For the HLA-B*07-restricted ligands, peptide-specific CD8 + T cells could be induced in 6/6 (P1 B*15 ), 1/3 (P2 B*07 ) and 3/4 (P3 B*07 ) HVs, respectively, with a maximum frequency of 14.1% peptide-specific CD8 + T cells. For the HLA-B*15-restricted ligand (P4 B*15 ), peptide-specific CD8 + T cells could be induced in 2/3 HVs with a maximum frequency of 9.5% tetramer-positive CD8 + T cells. The functionality and specificity of peptide-specific CD8 + T cells after aAPC-based in vitro priming was validated by intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 as well as for the expression of the degranulation marker CD107a. In 3/3 HVs primed with P1 B*07 (RPIPIKYKAM) as well as in 1/2 HVs primed with P4 B*15 (HQKRPIPIKY), we detected specific and functional CD8 + T cell populations after stimulation with the mutated peptides, but not after stimulation with the corresponding wild type peptides (P1 WT : RLIPIKYKAM, P4 WT : HQKRLIPIKY). Furthermore, the peptide-specific cytotoxic activity of specific CD8 + T cells was demonstrated in a VITAL assay. The polyclonal P1 B*07 - and P4 B*15 -specific CD8 + T cells (0.12% and 0.76% peptide-specific T cells, respectively) lysed autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells loaded with the mutated peptides, but not cells presenting the wild type peptides. P4 B*15 -specific CD8 + T cells showed 17.9% (\u00b11.2%) MYD88 L265P -peptide-specific cell killing at an E/T ratio of 1:1 compared to 2.6% (\u00b11.2%) of non-specific cell lysis of unspecific effector cells against the same targets in three independent replicates, respectively. The specific lysis showed an E/T ratio-dependent manner as the specific lysis decreases with reducing E/T ratios. P1 B*07 -specific CD8 + T cells specifically killed 11.4% (\u00b11.7%) of MYD88 L265P loaded targets at an E/T ratio of 0.7:1 in comparison to 2.1% unspecific lysis of unspecific effector cells. In this study, we identified and characterized MYD88 L265P mutation-derived HLA class I ligands for T cell mediated immunotherapy. The strong immunogenicity of the HLA-B*07 and HLA-B*15-restricted mutation-derived peptides as well as the functionality and specificity of peptide-specific CD8 + T cells, demonstrated by cytotoxicity assays, underline the potential of the MYD88 L265P mutation as tumor-specific target. These data highlight the potential of MYD88 L265P mutation-specific immunotherapy as a novel broadly applicable and tumor-specific treatment approach for patients with MYD88 L265P+ NHL.
