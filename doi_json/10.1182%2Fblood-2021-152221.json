    "abstract_text": "Introduction. The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) regulates the 3D chromatin architecture by facilitating chromosomal loops and forming the boundaries of structural domains. In addition, CTCF is an important transcription factor and regulator of antigen receptor and T cell receptor recombination events. CTCF inactivating events have been found in various human cancers. Loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) or inactivating missense mutations in specific zinc- fingers have been identified in many human cancers including sporadic breast cancer, prostate cancer, Wilms-tumors and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Heterozygous deletions or point mutations have been identified in over half of the patients with breast cancer or uterine endometrial cancers, deregulating global gene expression by altering methylated genomic states and poor survival. Here, we investigated the functional significance and molecular-cytogenetic associations of CTCF aberrations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. Methods. Biopsies from a cohort of 181 pediatric T-ALL patients who enrolled on DCOG or COALL protocols and/or their derivative patient-derived xenograft models were screened for alterations in global DNA copy number, methylation status, topologically associating domain organization and CTCF and cohesion binding patterns and changes in local TLX3 and BCL11B promoter enhancer loops using array-comparative genomic hybridization, single molecule Molecular Inversion Probe sequencing, targeted locus amplification, gene expression and DNA methylation microarrays, Hi-C sequencing, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and/or real-time quantitative PCR. Ctcf f/fl mice 1 were crossed on a the Lck -cre transgenic background 2 to study the impact of Ctcf loss during early T-cell development. Results. We here describe that inactivation of CTCF can drive subtle and local genomic effects that elevate oncogene expression levels from driver chromosomal rearrangements. We find that for T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), heterozygous CTCF deletions or inactivating mutations are present in nearly 50 percent of t(5;14)(q35;q32.2) rearranged patients that positions the TLX3 oncogene in the vicinity of the BCL11B enhancer. Functional CTCF loss results in diminished expression of the \u03b1\u03b2-lineage commitment factor BCL11B from the non-rearranged allele and \u03b3\u03b4-lineage development. Unexpectedly, it also drives higher levels of the TLX3 oncogene from the translocated allele. We demonstrate that heterozygous CTCF aberrations specifically occur in TLX3 -rearranged patients with distal breakpoints that preserve CTCF bindings sites in the translocation breakpoint areas in between the BCL11B enhancer and the TLX3 oncogene. We show that these intervening CTCF sites insulate TLX3 from the enhancer by forming competitive loops with TLX3 . Upon loss of CTCF, or the deletion of the intervening CTCF sites, these competitive loops are weakened and loops with the BCL11B enhancer are stimulated, boosting TLX3 oncogene expression levels and leukemia burden in these T-ALL patients. Conclusions.  CTCF aberrations are especially associated with t(5;14)(q35;q32.2) rearranged T-ALL patients who maintain TLX3 -proximal CTCF sites reflects a necessity to neutralize these sites in order to topologically enable the distal BCL11B enhancer to interact with the TLX3 oncogene and to boost its expression. Collectively, this provides direct demonstration of a mechanism in which loss of CTCF result in removal of enhancer insulation that facilitates elevated levels of an oncogene in leukemia.
