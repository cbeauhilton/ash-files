    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3596 Introduction: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease with a variable clinical course and a large spectrum of treatment options. Based on FISH data, a prognostic classification system has been established with 13q deletions as sole abnormality associated with a favorable prognosis and 17p and 11q deletions correlating with an unfavorable outcome. Recently, the combined evaluation of FISH data, IGHV mutation status and chromosome banding analysis (CBA) revealed that the impact of distinct genetic parameters differs with respect to overall survival (OS) and time to treatment (TTT). Thus far only few data is available on less frequent genetic abnormalities such as 14q deletions and translocations involving the IGH@ locus (tIGH). Therefore, we analyzed CLL with tIGH in detail with respect to frequency, partner genes and impact on prognosis. Methods/Patients: 78 CLL cases with tIGH were identified from 2,135 CLL sent to our laboratory for diagnostic work-up. All cases had been evaluated by immunphentotyping, FISH and CBA. Result: The most frequent tIGH was t(14;19)(q32;q13) (BCL3, n=21) followed by t(14;18)(q32;q21) (BCL2, n=19), t(8;14)(q24;q32) (CMYC, n=7) and t(11;14)(q13;q32) (CCND1, n=6). In the remaining 25 cases 5 recurrent translocations (t(2;14)(p13;q32), n=3; t(4;14)(p16;q32), FGFR3, n=2; t(11;14)(p15;q32), n=2; t(14;17)(q32;q25), n=2; and t(7;14)(q21;q32), n=2) were observed while the remaining 14 translocations were identified in single cases only. In 9/78 cases (11.5%) the tIGH was the sole abnormality. Recurrent additional chromosome abnormalities were +12 (n=7), del(13q) (n=9), del(11q) (n=3). A 17p deletion was observed in 1 case. In two cases tIGH was present only in a subclone and was a secondary abnormality occurring in addition to an del(11q) and a +12, respectively. CLL with tIGH were compared to 401 CLL without tIGH comprising all other genetic subgroups (subdivided according to Do\u0308hner et al.: del(17p) n=26, del(11q) n=42, +12 n=42, \u201cnormal\u201d n=88, del(13q) sole n=177 and del(14q) n=26). An unmutated IGHV status was more frequent in CLL with tIGH as compared to all others (26/46 (54.3%) vs 128/353 (36.3%); p=0.023). For 53 cases with tIGH and all cases of the non-tIGH cohort clinical follow-up data was available. Median OS was 143.8 months (mo) in CLL with tIGH and 72.9 mo in patients with del(17p) while it was not reached in all other subgroups. In Cox regression analysis only del(17p) and mutated IGHV status were significantly associated with OS (p<0.0001, relative risk (RR)=7.0; p=0.014, RR=0.38). Median TTT was as follows: total cohort: 60.9 mo; tIGH: 27.8 mo; del(17p): 58.9 mo; del(11q): 19.7 mo; +12: n.r.; \u201cnormal\u201d 63.9 mo; del(13q) sole: 83.0 mo and del(14q): 21.0 mo. In univariate Cox regression analysis the following parameters were significantly associated with shorter TTT: tIGH (p=0.004, RR=1.82), del(11q) (p<0.0001, RR=2.55), and del(14q) (p=0.007, RR=2.1), while del(13q) sole and mutated IGHV status were associated with longer TTT (p<0.0001, RR=0.40; p<0.0001, RR=0.23). In multivariate analysis including tIGH, del(11q), del(14q) and del(13q) sole all parameters retained their impact on TTT. However, if IGHV mutation status was included in the model only the mutated IGHV mutation status retained an impact on TTT (p<0.0001, RR=0.26). Next, patients with tIGH were subdivided according to their partner genes. Median OS was not reached in all subgroups, while median TTT was as follows: t(11;14): 101.2 mo, t(14;18): 47.9 mo, t(14;19): 11.0 mo, t(8;14): 18.5 mo and other partner genes: 27.8 mo. In univariate Cox regression analysis only t(14;19) was significantly associated with shorter TTT (p<0.001, RR=3.1). Including t(14;19) into multivariate analysis revealed a significant impact of both mutated IGHV mutation status and t(14;19) on TTT (p<0.0001, RR=0.286; p=0.004, RR=3.60). Conclusion: Translocations involving the IGH@ locus occur at low frequency in CLL. They are associated with unmutated IGHV status and a shorter TTT. TTT is especially short in cases with t(14;19). The prognostic impact of t(14;19) is independent of IGHV mutation status. In contrast CLL with t(11;14) and t(14;18) are neither associated with shorter OS nor shorter TTT. This data supports the application of CBA in CLL in order to identify all clinically relevant chromosomal aberrations, including those not detected by routine FISH analysis.
