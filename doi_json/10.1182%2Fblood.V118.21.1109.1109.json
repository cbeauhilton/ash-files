    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1109 Plasma cell differentiation is initiated by antigen stimulation of B cell receptor (BCR). Until BCR stimulation, BLIMP1, a master regulator of plasma cell differentiation, is suppressed by PAX5, a key transcriptional repressor to maintain B cell identity. After BCR stimulation, upregulation of BLIMP1 and subsequent suppression of PAX5 by BLIMP1 are observed and thought to be the trigger of plasma cell differentiation; however, the trigger that derepresses BLIMP1 expression is yet to be revealed. Here, we demonstrated PAX5 phosphorylation by ERK1/2, the main component of BCR signal, in vitro and in vivo . The sites of PAX5 phosphorylation were identified by PCR mutagenesis assay. In luciferase reporter assays, transcriptional repression on BLIMP1 promoter by PAX5 was canceled by PAX5 phosphorylation. Furthermore, transcriptional repression by phosphorylation-defective mutant of PAX5 was attenuated by CA-MEK1 co-expression to a significantly lesser extent than that by wild-type PAX5, indicating its resistance to ERK1/2 signal-dependent cancelation of the transcriptional repression ( Figure A). Finally, BCR stimulation induced strong ERK1/2 activation, phosphorylation of endogenous PAX5 ( Figure B), and upregulation of BLIMP1 mRNA expression in B cells. These phenomena were inhibited by U0126, MEK1 inhibitor. These data imply that PAX5 phosphorylation by BCR signal is the initial event in plasma cell differentiation ( Figure C).
