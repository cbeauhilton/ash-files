    "abstract_text": "Background: Activating mutations of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) occur in 30% of patients (pts) with de novo AML and confer a worse prognosis. KW-2449 is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor highly potent against mutant FLT3 (IC 50 = 1\u20137 nmol/L) and other tyrosine kinases including FGFR1, TrkA, Abl (including T315I), JAK2, c-KIT, and c-SRC and Aurora A serine tyrosine kinase. Based on the anti-leukemia activity of KW-2449 demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo preclinical leukemia models, KW-2449 is being evaluated in hematologic conditions in the first-in-man study. Methods: The study objectives were to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic effects of KW-2449 in pts with refractory/relapsed AML or treatment resistant/intolerant CML/ALL and MDS. A range of daily doses of KW-2449 (25\u2013500 mg/day) divided into q 12h dosing on 2 treatment schedules (14 days vs. 28 days) with a recovery period of 7\u201328 days between cycles. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximally tolerated dose were assessed for the 1 st cycle. Serial samples for PK analysis were collected immediately before and after KW-2449 on treatment days 1, 14 and 28. The 28-day schedule was later eliminated. Plasma concentrations of KW-2449 and its active metabolite (M1) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. A plasma inhibitory activity (PIA) assay [Blood 108(10) 3477\u201383] for P-FLT3 and P-STAT5 was used to measure FLT3 inhibition. Results: To date, 29 pts (15 female) have been enrolled (median age 60 years; range 25\u201382) and treated at 5 dose levels: 25, 50, 100, 200, and 300 mg daily. Twenty-five pts had AML and 4 CML (3 with T315I mutation); 24 pts completed at least 1 cycle. KW-2449 was rapidly absorbed and metabolized to M1. Elimination half-lives were 2.8\u20133.9 h for KW-2449 and 3.8\u20135.5 h for M1. Plasma levels of M1 were lower on Days 14 and 28 compared to Day 1, suggesting inhibition of this pathway upon multiple dosing. A single DLT of grade 3 pneumonia was reported on 100 mg but no further DLTs were seen in the expanded cohort at that dose or at 200 or 300 mg daily. A total of 33 SAEs were reported of which 6 were considered possibly related (by the Investigator) to KW-2449: dyspnea, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, cardiac ischemia, ventricular arrhythmia, and pleural effusion. There have been 5 deaths on study (none drug-related): disease progression (2), neutropenic sepsis, infection with renal failure, and pneumonia. Seven pts had stable disease after 1 cycle. Three pts with AML (2 FLT3+) had \u2265 50% reduction in peripheral and/or bone marrow blasts in the 1 st cycle. In vivo FLT3 inhibition, as measured directly in patient blasts, correlated with blast reduction. The extent and duration of FLT3 inhibition increased with increases in dose. Conclusions: KW-2449 appears safe and well tolerated at the dose levels evaluated. Transient decreases in peripheral blood and bone marrow blasts have been observed in a few patients justifying continued investigation with this agent. Accrual is ongoing and a different schedule to accommodate the short t 1/2 will be explored."
