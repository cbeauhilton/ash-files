    "abstract_text": "Motexafin gadolinium (MGd, Xcytrin \u00ae ) is a novel anti-cancer drug that selectively concentrates in cancer cells and disrupts redox dependent pathways by targeting oxidative stress related proteins such as thioredoxin reductase and metallothioneins. MGd has been shown to generate reactive oxygen species and induce apoptosis in tumor cells. We initiated a study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MGd in two B-cell malignancies, relapsed/refractory LG and relapsed/refractory CLL or CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). MGd was given intravenously (IV) at 6mg/kg/day for 3 days q 2 weeks for LG and 5mg/kg/day for 10 days q 3 weeks for CLL/SLL. Ten patients (pts) with LG (2 grade 1, 5 grade 2, 1 grade 3 follicular, 2 marginal zone), 2 pts with CLL/SLL and 1 pt with CLL have been enrolled. Median age was 64.5 yrs (range 44\u201377), median prior treatment regimens was 3.5 (range 1\u20136) and median time from diagnosis to treatment was 52 mo. Many LG pts had failed prior aggressive treatment regimens including: CHOP (4), ICE (1), HyperCVAD(1), auto-bone marrow transplant (1); all failed rituxamab and 6 failed Zevalin. CLL/SLL and CLL pts had failed rituxamab (3), fludarabine (2), and R-CHOP (1). MGd related adverse events included skin and urine discoloration (6 and 4 pts), diarrhea, nausea, vesiculobullous rash, peripheral neuropathy (3 pts each). MGd related \u2265gr 3 adverse events included skin rash (3 pts), fatigue, neuropathy, photosensitivity (1 pt each). Importantly, no MGd-related myelosuppression was observed. In 12 evaluable pts, there have been three PRs of 2+, 5+ and 8 months duration (2 follicular, 1 CLL). Two pts had SD (follicular, SLL) one of these had resolution of lymphoma related autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Responses occurred after \u22642 cycles of therapy and were seen in patients after extensive prior treatment (mean 4.3 prior regimens, range 3\u20137). MGd is a non-myelosuppressive drug with single agent activity in LG and CLL/SLL.",
