    "abstract_text": "Fhl2 is a member of four and one half LIM domain protein family. It acts as a transcriptional modulator, regulating proliferation and apoptosis in a cell-context dependent manner. The role of endogenous Fhl2 in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSCs/HPCs) is still unknown. To determine the in vivo function of Fhl2 in hematopoiesis, we characterized the HSCs/HPCs in Fhl2 -null mice. At age of 3 months, Fhl2 -null mice revealed normal hematopoietic parameters. As shown by flow cytometric analysis, Fhl2 -null mice had a normal distribution of Mac-1 + Gr + myeloid cells, B220 + B cells and CD3 + T cells in bone marrow and spleen, suggesting that Fhl2 l oss does not affect mature cell differentiation in young mice. The frequency and total number of stem cell enriched population LSK (Lin - Sca + c-Kit + ) and Long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) (Lin - Sca + c-Kit + CD48 - CD150 + ) were marginally increased in Fhl2 -/- mice as compared to wildtype mice, whereas the frequency and the number of hematopoietic progenitor cells was reduced in Fhl2 -/- mice as compared to Fhl2 +/+ mice. Transplantation exposes HSCs to various stresses including replicative and oxidative stresses. To examine whether Fhl2 regulates the function of HSCs/HPCs under stress, we transplanted bone marrow cells from Fhl2 -/- or control mice into lethally-irradiated wildtype mice to generate chimeric mice. 7 months after transplantation, the Fhl2 -/- chimeric mice developed MDS-like disease with a significant decrease in platelet, red blood cell (RBC) counts and Hemoglobin (Hb) level as compared to control chimeric mice. The number of LT-HSC, LSK and HPCs in Fhl2 -/- chimeric mice were significantly less than they were in control chimeric mice, as determined by flow cytometric analysis. However, the frequency of Mac-1 + Gr-1 + myeloid cells, B220 + B cells and CD3 + T cells were comparable in Fhl2 -/- and Fhl2 +/+ chimeric mice, suggesting that Fhl2 loss reduces repopulation capacity of LT-HSCs but does not affect HPCs differentiation in recipient mice. As evidenced by the reduced G 0 population of HSCs and LSKs in Fhl2 -null chimeric mice as compared to control chimeric mice, Fhl2 may regulate HSCs self-renewal under stress by controlling HSC quiescence. To further determine the function of HSCs, we performed the competitive repopulation assay. In agreement with the observation that Fhl2 -/- HSCs have a reduced repopulation capacity, the ratio of Fhl2 -/- derived total Peripheral Blood (PB) cells vs. competitor-derived PB cells was significantly decreased as compared to Fhl2 +/+ - derived recipients at secondary transplantation, and the ratio gradually decreased up to 4-5-fold as compared to Fhl2 +/+ - derived recipients at tertiary transplantation. Previously, we showed that FHL2 is down-regulated in subsets of Therapy-related Myelodyplastic Syndrome or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (t-MDS/t-AML patients). Together, these data suggest that Fhl2 is required for maintenance of HSCs/HPCs, and its downregulation may contribute to the development of t-MDS/t-AML in patients.
