    "abstract_text": "NK cells largely contribute to the success of monoclonal antibody (mAb) application in cancer due to their ability to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a feature considered critical for therapeutic success. Up to now, no immunotherapeutic antibodies are available for the treatment of myeloid leukemias. Recently, we reported on the development of mAb targeting CD133, which is expressed on a wide variety of tumor cells (Koerner et al., Blood 2014 124:2309). Here we extend our analyses and provide further data on the preclinical characterization of an Fc-engineered CD133 mAb for the treatment of myeloid leukemia. Compared to two other anti-human CD133 mAb (clones AC133 and W6B3), which both bound to primary AML and CML cells in 15/25 and 7/10 cases, respectively, clone 293C3 recognized the leukemic cells in 22/25 AML cases and 7/10 CML cases. Based on these results, clone 293C3 was chosen to generate chimeric mAb with either a wildtype Fc part (293C3-WT) or a variant containing amino acid exchanges (S239D/I332E) to enhance affinity to the activating Fc receptor CD16 on NK cells (293C3-SDIE). Treatment with 293C3-SDIE resulted in significantly enhanced activation, degranulation and lysis of primary CD133-positive AML cells by NK cells in allogeneic and autologous experimental ex vivo settings as compared to its wildtype counterpart. Considering the expression of CD133 on healthy hematopoietic progenitor cells, we further performed colony forming unit assays with healthy bone marrow (BM) cells. In line with the observed lower expression levels of CD133 on healthy compared to malignant hematopoietic cells no relevant toxicity of 293C3-SDIE at the level of committed hematopoietic progenitor cells was observed. Moreover, 293C3-SDIE did not induce lysis of of healthy BM cells by allogeneic or autologous NK cells. In a NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid IL2rg tmWjl /Sz (NSG) xenotransplantation model, induction of ADCC by treatment with 293C3-SDIE resulted in the elimination of patient AML cells by NK cells from a matched human donor. Thus, 293C3-SDIE constitutes an attractive immunotherapeutic compound, in particular for the elimination of minimal residual disease in CD133 bearing leukemia in the context of allogenic SCT.
