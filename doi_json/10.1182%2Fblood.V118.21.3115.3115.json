    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3115 Background: EATCL is a rare subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma frequently observed in patients with a history of celiac disease. EATCL is characterized by poor prognosis when treated with conventional chemotherapy with only 10\u201320 % of long-term survivors. Limited data are available on feasibility and efficacy of stem cell transplantation in this lymphoma entity. Patients and methods: The database of the EBMT was used to identify patients with EATCL who had received autologous and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation in 2000\u20132007. All centres reporting these patients were contacted to receive confirmation to histopathology report/pathology review and to obtain information in regard to treatment prior to stem cell transplantation and more recent follow-up data. Results: Altogether 85 patients with EATCL were identified. Seventy-three patients had received ASCT and 12 patients allogeneic SCT. Histological report/review with additional follow-up data was available from 22 ASCT treated patients which are reported here. There were 14 females (64 %) and eight males with a median age of 55 years at the time of transplant. Half of the patients had a history of coeliac disease. The median number of treatment lines before ASCT was 1 and 50 % of the patients were in the first remission at the time of ASCT. BEAM was the most commonly used high-dose regimen (17 pts, 77 %) and all patents received blood stem cell grafts. The median time from the diagnosis to ASCT was 6 months. The median follow-up time for living patients was 45 months from ASCT. During the follow-up relapse has been observed in 13 patients (59 %), the median time was only four months from ASCT. The median disease-free survival and overall survival were nine months and 15 months, respectively. Two-year overall survival, disease-free survival, cumulative incidence of relapse and non-relase mortality (NRM) was 45%, 40%, 55% and 4%, respectively. Conclusions: ASCT is feasible in selected patients with EATCL with a low NRM. Of transplanted patients 40 % remained disease-free beyond 2 years. This seems to be superior when compared to historical experiences although selection factors should be taken into account. ASCT is a treatment option in transplant eligible EATCL patients who respond to initial therapy. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
