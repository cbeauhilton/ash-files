    "abstract_text": "The clinical benefits of chelation therapy for treating iron overload are well established. In a large randomized Phase III study conducted in 586 iron overloaded patients with \u03b2-thalassemia to assess once daily oral therapy with deferasirox versus subcutaneous deferoxamine (DFO), we previously showed that deferasirox led to a statistically significant reduction of iron burden in patients whose baseline LIC was \u2265 7 mg Fe/g dw and that this change was similar to that observed with DFO. We have subsequently analyzed the role of transfusional iron intake in influencing individual responses. In this study, transfusion data were collected among 296 patients receiving deferasirox and 290 patients receiving DFO. If volumes (in mL RBC) were provided for the transfusions, iron intake (in mg) was calculated by multiplying the mL RBC by 1.08. If transfusion was reported as number of units, each unit was assumed to contain 185 mL RBC or 200 mg iron. For each patient, the cumulative transfusion amounts during the study were recorded, and the total iron intake was calculated as mg/kg/day using the patients\u2019 body weight and their time on study. The average iron intake rate during the study was 0.38 mg/kg/day which corresponds to approximately 0.35 mL/kg/day. The 25\u201375th percentiles included 0.30 to 0.47 mg/kg/day. Among patients receiving deferasirox, 70 (23.6%), 174 (58.8%) and 52 (17.6%) had a transfusional iron intake rate of 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively. Patients in the lowest transfusional iron loading group (0.5 mg/kg/day had an average intake rate of 0.39 and 0.55 mg/kg/day, respectively. The iron intake in mg/kg/day was higher in young children compared to adolescents and adults (0.48 for 0.5 mg/kg/day group.
