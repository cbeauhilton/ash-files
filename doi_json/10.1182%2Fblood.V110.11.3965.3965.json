    "abstract_text": "Background AL amyloidosis can be associated with coagulopathy due to acquired factor X (FX) deficiency. Published experience, limited to case reports, suggests that infusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets, plasma exchange, and vitamin K are of limited hemostatic efficacy for periprocedural management of coagulopathy. Therefore, we reviewed our cumulative experience of managing patients (pt) with FX deficiency due to AL amyloidosis who underwent an invasive procedure. Methods Pt with AL amyloidosis and isolated FX deficiency (\u2264 50%), who underwent an invasive procedure between January 1975 and May 2007, were retrospectively identified from institutional databases. We excluded bone marrow biopsies as well as procedures >3 months prior to the diagnosis of FX deficiency. Endpoints of the study were bleeding, thrombosis, and death. Results Sixty-one pt fit the study criteria. They were arbitrarily classified as having severe (<10%; n=6), moderate (10\u201325%; n=16), or mild (26\u201350%; n=39) FX deficiency. The pt underwent a total of 115 procedures, 13 (11.3%) of which were considered major procedures and 102 (88.7%) were minor procedures. Major Procedures 13 pt underwent a major procedure; 4 had severe FX deficiency, 2 moderate, and 7 mild. Procedures included splenectomy, colon resection, renal transplant, and others. All 4 of the pt with severe deficiency were treated with hemostatic agents (FFP, plasma exchange, tranexamic acid, danazol, aminocaproic acid, and rFVIIa) in the perioperative period. Two (50%) of these patients had complications: intraabdominal hematoma and death. The death occurred in a patient with splenic rupture and uncontrolled hemorrhage refractory to rFVIIa and FFP. None of the pt with moderate deficiency experienced complications, despite not receiving hemostatic agents. Similarly, 0/7 patients with mild deficiency developed complications (2 received hemostatic agents FFP, platelets, vitamin K, and DDAVP). Minor Procedures All 61 pt underwent a minor procedure; central venous catheter placement was the most common (n=26), followed by EGD with biopsy (n=16) and renal biopsy (n=10). Six pt with severe deficiency underwent 7 minor procedures, 2 (29%) of which were associated with excess bleeding, despite rFVIIa treatment in both cases. An additional 3 procedures were performed with hemostatic agents and were uncomplicated. 2/16 (13%) pt with moderate deficiency had excess bleeding, 1 of whom was treated with rFVIIa and the other was not treated. Two others received perioperative treatment and did not have a complication. There were 7 complications in the 39 patients with mild deficiency (18%), including 1 AV fistula thrombosis after rFVIIa. Five of the patients with a bleeding complication did not receive treatment. One patient with mild deficiency received procoagulants and did not have excess bleeding. Conclusions -This is the largest series examining the perioperative management of pt with FX deficiency due to AL amyloidosis -Complications occurred in 11.3% of procedures, including one death -In this series, there were no clear predictors of bleeding -FX deficiency did not contribute to mortality, with the exception of 1 case -Bleeding risk is relatively infrequent in pt with mild or moderate FX deficiency, particularly with non-vascular procedures -Although optimal management of pt with severe FX deficiency is unclear, options include rhFVIIa +/\u2212 FFP and aminocaproic acid in those requiring procoagulant therapy.",
