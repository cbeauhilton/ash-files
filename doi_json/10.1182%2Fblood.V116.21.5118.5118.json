    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5118 Background: Increased factor VIII:C ( FVIII:C ) and hypofibrinolysis are VTE risk factors, and beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors reduce FVIII:C and enhance fibrinolysis, respectively. Objective: To test the hypotheses that beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors reduce VTE risk. Methods: Using longitudinal, population-based Rochester Epidemiology Project resources, we identified all Olmsted County, MN residents with objectively-diagnosed incident VTE over the 13-year period, 1988\u20132000 (n=1306), and one to two Olmsted County residents per case matched on age, event year and duration of prior medical history (n=1500). For cases and controls, we reviewed their complete medical history in the community for previously-identified VTE risk factors (e.g., hospitalization with or without surgery, nursing home confinement, trauma/fracture, leg paresis, active cancer, superficial vein thrombosis and varicose veins), as well as body mass index ( BMI ), coronary artery disease ( CAD ), congestive heart failure ( CHF ), and the use of statins, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonist drugs. Using conditional logistic regression, we tested beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor antagonists for an association with VTE, both individually and after adjusting for age, BMI, previously-identified VTE risk factors, CAD, CHF and the use of statins. Results: Among cases and controls respectively, 191 and 173 received beta-blockers, and 171 and 154 received ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Univariately, both beta-blockers (unadjusted OR=1.31; p=0.02) and ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor antagonists (unadjusted OR=1.32; p=0.02) were modestly associated with increased VTE risk. However, after controlling for age, BMI, previously-identified VTE risk factors, CAD, CHF and the use of statins, beta-blockers (OR=1.06; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.51; p=0.75) and ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor antagonists (OR=0.94; 95% CI: 0.65, 1.37; p=0.75) were no longer associated with VTE. Conclusions: Beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor antagonists do not appear to be protective against VTE. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
