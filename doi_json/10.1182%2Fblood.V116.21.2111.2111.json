    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2111 INTRODUCTION: The integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 mediates platelet aggregation by binding to fibrinogen and other plasma proteins. Inherited defects of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 result in the mucocutaneous bleeding disorder, Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT). However, pharmacological inhibition of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 can reduce mortality after myocardial infarction and percutaneous stent placement. Thus the degree to which \u03b1IIb\u03b23 functions is critical. One element influencing the degree of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 function is its level of surface expression on the platelet. The post-translational mechanisms controlling surface expression remain unclear, but their stringency is evident in certain GT patients whose full length \u03b1IIb\u03b23 complexes are completely retained and degraded intracellularly. A clearer understanding of the post-translational processes controlling \u03b1IIb\u03b23 surface expression can provide insight into a pathway that is a potential target for novel \u03b1IIb\u03b23-targeted therapies. Toward that end we previously reported the interaction of \u03b1IIb with DNAJC10, an hsp40 type chaperone protein, which was identified by a proteomic analysis of \u03b1IIb-interacting proteins. Continuing that investigation, we have explored the function of DNAJC10 in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 biogenesis pathway. METHODS: Megakaryocytes were derived from human umbilical cord blood (UCB) by enrichment of UCB leukocytes for CD34+ progenitor cells followed by culture in serum-free medium with thrombopoietin and stem cell factor. Under our conditions the UCB leukocytes differentiate into a population of large cells of which > 90% express \u03b1IIb\u03b23, > 80% express GPIb, and about 50% express \u03b12\u03b21. Interaction of \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 with DNAJC10 was tested by co-immunoprecipitation with mAbs specific for \u03b1IIb (CA3, M148, B1B5), b3 (7H2), or the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 complex (10E5). Megakaryocytes were treated with a proteasome inhibitor (MG-132) to increase the capture of \u03b1IIb (and potential interacting proteins) that had been routed to the proteasome for degradation. DNAJC10, \u03b1IIb, and \u03b23 localization within megakaryocytes and platelets was observed with immunofluorescence, and compared to localization of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. The effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of DNAJC10 on \u03b1IIb\u03b23 expression was assessed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. RNA depletion was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: DNAJC10 co-immunoprecipitated with \u03b1IIb-specific (CA3, M148, B1B5), \u03b23-specific (7H2), and complex-specific (10E5) mAbs, indicating that it associated with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in megakaryocytes. An antibody (B1B5) that recognized pro-\u03b1IIb and pro-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 co-immunoprecipitated much more DNAJC10 than antibodies preferentially recognizing mature \u03b1IIb and \u03b1IIb\u03b23. The amount of DNAJC10 immunoprecipitated was markedly increased after cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor. siRNA against DNAJC10 resulted in significantly elevation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 surface expression on megakaryocytes as judged by flow cytometry. Immunofluorescence with confocal microscopy surprisingly revealed that DNAJC10, nominally an endoplasmic reticulum protein, did not colocalize with ER markers, but was distributed in foci throughout the megakaryocytes, proplatelet processes, platelet buds, and mature peripheral blood platelets. CONCLUSIONS: DNAJC10 engages the precursor forms of \u03b1IIb and \u03b1IIb\u03b23 at a point upstream of degradation and may be an intermediate step in targeting these to the proteasome. Since siRNA mediated knockdown of DNAJC10 resulted in increased \u03b1IIb\u03b23 surface expression, this chaperone may be a negative regulator of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 surface expression.
