    "abstract_text": "Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) is a noninfectious acute lung injury, often fatal, following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Similar to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), IPS is mediated by type 1 cytopathic T cells accompanied with high levels of proinflammatory cytokines. We previously showed that elevated plasma soluble Stimulation-2 (sST2), which acts as a decoy receptor for IL-33, is a risk factor of death by GVHD ( N. Engl. J. Med, 2013 ) or by IPS ( Biol Blood Marrow Transplant, 2018 ). ST2 blockade of the excess of sST2 with a neutralizing antibody or small molecules released plasmatic IL-33, increasing its availability to cytoprotective T cells expressing the transmembrane molecule form of ST2, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) reducing the type 1 proinflammatory T cell-response ( Sci Transl Med, 2015; JCI Insight, 2019 ). The membrane-ST2 is also expressed on type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), mostly present in lungs. Herein, we first confirmed in a cohort of 673 HCT patients that plasma sST2 measured 14 days following HCT is increased 10 fold in IPS patients (n=22) as compared to controls with no IPS/GVHD (n=271), and is 6 fold higher as compared to GVHD patients (n=380) ( Figure 1A ). Patients with IPS and high sST2 levels above the median of 200 ng/ml, were significantly more likely to die than patients with lower sST2 levels ( Figure 1B ). In a therapeutic translational purpose, we then inquired if local administration of IL-33 via intranasal route at a dose of 500 ng/mouse daily (5 doses from day -1 to +3) will ameliorate the recipients' pulmonary function tests in a major-mismatched B6 \u2192 Balb/c HCT murine model. Allogeneic recipients that received IL-33 improved their lung compliance (C), lung resistance (R), and elastance (E) as compared to vehicle treated mice ( Figure 2A ). Based on our patients' data, we further explored the sST2/IL-33 ratio. Although the treatment was local, plasma IL-33 increased at day +7 post-HCT and therefore the sST2/IL-33 ratio was significantly decreased in IL-33 treated mice ( Figure 2B ). Parraleling this decrease, both systemic IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 at day +7 post-HCT were significantly lower in mice treated with IL-33 compared to vehicle treated mice ( Figure 2B ). Findings in the plasma were also correlated with a local decrease of IFN\u03b3 secretion in the bronchoalveolar lavage of IL-33 treated mice (not shown). The frequencies and numbers of donor CD45.1 + IFNg + CD4 + and IFNg + CD8 + donor T cells in the lungs of IL-33 treated mice were also significantly decreased as compared to vehicle treated mice ( Figure 2C ). We next sought to determine if IL-33 had an impact on recipient ILC2s (CD45.2 + Lin-CD90.2 + GATA3 + ST2 + ). As shown in Figure 2D , recipient mice treated with IL-33 had significant higher frequencies of lung ILC2s at day +7 post-HCT compared to mice treated with vehicle. RNA-seq analysis of sorted ILC2s from the lungs of na\u00efve GATA3 reporter mice treated with IL-33 showed increased Il9 and PU.1 transcripts in lung ILC2s, validated at the protein level in allogeneic mice treated with IL-33 as compared to allogeneic vehicle treated mice in which ILC2s were undetectebale ( Figure 2D ). As antibody (Ab) injection is more clinically relevant than local cytokine instillation, and since we have shown that anti-ST2 Ab results in IL-33 increase, we tested this in a minor-mismatched B6 \u2192 C3H.SW HCT murine model, and respectively treated mice with anti-ST2 Ab 100\u03bcg/dose every other day (6 doses total) or anti-ST2 Ab 200\u03bcg/dose for 2 doses at days -1 and +1 or isotype 100\u03bcg/dose for 6 doses. Prophylactic administration of anti-ST2 Ab with 6 doses and 2 doses significantly decreases mortality as compared to isotype with six doses allowing a better survival than the peritransplant administration ( Figure 3A ). Plasma IL-33 increased in both anti-ST2 treated groups vs. isotype ( Figure 3B ). Consistently, both plasma IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 were significantly decreased in anti-ST2 Ab treated groups ( Figures 3C, 3D ). Percentages of cytopathic lung donor CD4 + IFN\u03b3 + and CD8 + IFN\u03b3 + T cells were decreased ( Figure 3E ) while cytoprotective lung recipient total, IL-9 + , and PU.1 + ILC2s were increased in anti-ST2 Ab treated groups vs. isotype ( Figures 3F, 3G ). Tregs in both anti-ST2 Ab treated groups were concomitantly increased ( Figure 3H ). We concluded that not only is sST2 a prognostic biomarker for IPS but it is also a promising therapeutic target that may prevent IPS via IL-33 induced IL-9 secreting ILC2s.
