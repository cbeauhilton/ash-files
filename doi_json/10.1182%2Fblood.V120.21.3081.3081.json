    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3081 Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only proven curative therapy for the hematological abnormalities in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA). In the mid-1990s, survival after alternative donor (AD)-HCT was reported to be 18% with excessive rates of regimen-related toxicity, graft failure, graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and opportunistic infections (OI). Between 1990 and 2010, 127 FA patients underwent AD-HCT at the University of Minnesota using one of 5 consecutive, prospective phase I-II total body irradiation (TBI) containing clinical trials, representing the largest single center experience. All patients received cyclophosphamide (CY, 40 mg/kg) and single fraction TBI. Sequential changes were made to prevent GVHD, graft failure and OI and ultimately enhance survival; in 1994, all patients received T cell depleted (TCD) bone marrow (BM) or umbilical cord blood (UCB) to reduce GVHD; in 1999, fludarabine (FLU) was added to enhance engraftment; in 2003, thymic shielding (TS) was added to reduce OI risk; and in 2006, TBI dose reduction was evaluated to reduce toxicity. Over this time period, HLA-matched unrelated donor BM was the donor of choice with partially HLA matched BM and UCB only used as alternatives. Neutrophil recovery was twice as likely after FLU-containing regimens than non-FLU containing regimens and was not deleteriously affected by TS or reducing TBI dose to 300cGy. Grade II-IV acute GVHD was significantly reduced by the use of TCD (18%) compared to T replete BM or UCB (50% and 38%, respectively: p10 years) or CMV seropositive, received any transfusions before HCT, or developed OI before HCT (Table). Mortality was lowest using CY/FLU/ATG, TBI 300 cGy with TS (Trial 5, relative risk [RR] 0.1; p<0.01). For 10 patients on Trial 5 who had no prior history of transfusions or OI, incidences of neutrophil and platelet are 100% and 100%, acute and chronic GVHD 17% and 0%, and probability of survival is 92%.

View Large Substantial progress has been made in the successful application of AD-HCT for FA. These data support the urgency of transplant prior to the onset of severe pancytopenia when risk of OI and transfusions are more likely, particularly when a suitable BM donor is available. While other regimens are being explored, CY/FLU/ATG/TBI300 with TS should be considered a new standard of care for FA patients undergoing AD-HCT.
