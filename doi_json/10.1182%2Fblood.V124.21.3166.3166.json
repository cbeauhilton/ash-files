    "abstract_text": "Background : Approximately 25% of patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) harbor calreticulin ( CALR ) mutations, which have been associated with longer survival (Klampf et al. NEJM 2013). More than 80% of CALR mutated patients harbor one of two mutation variants: type 1, a 52-bp deletion (p.L367fs*46) or type 2, a 5-bp TTGTC insertion (p.K385fs*47). Recent studies have suggested phenotypic and prognostic differences between these two variants (Tefferi et al. Blood 2014, Leukemia 2014 and AJH 2014). Furthermore, data are emerging that suggest functionally-relevant structural differences between type 1 and type 2 CALR variants, including a higher alpha-helix content of the mutant C-terminus in type 2, compared to type 1 (Eder-Azanza et al. Leukemia 2014). Objectives : We used statistical models to calculate helix propensity for thirty-one unique amino acid sequences that were altered by CALR mutations and used the results to subclassify non-type 1/2 CALR mutations into \u201ctype 1-like\u201d and \u201ctype 2-like\u201d variants. Subsequently, we examined the prognostic relevance of these subgroups. Methods : Calculation of helix propensity, which is the percentage of residues that are predicted to be involved in the formation of an alpha-helix, was performed using AGADIR, which is a statistical approximation algorithm (Munoz et al. Biopolymers 1997). The helix tendency calculations were performed using conditions of pH 7.0, 5 and 25 \u00b0C, an ionic strength of 0.1 M and no N- or C-terminal protection. Results : 532 PMF patients were screened for JAK2 , CALR and MPL mutations; the respective mutational frequencies were 58%, 24.6% and 7.3%. Among the 131 CALR -mutated cases, 98 (74.8%) harbored type 1, 15 (11.5%) type 2 and 18 (13.7%) other variants. Based on predicted helix propensity scale, the \u201cother\u201d CALR mutations were subclassified as type 1-like ( n =12) or type 2-like ( n =6) and respectively grouped with type 1 and type 2 variants, for purposes of phenotypic and prognostic comparisons. The AGADIR-derived predicted helix propensity scale was 29.69 for wild-type CALR and 8.6 or 34.17 for type 1 and type 2 mutant CALR , respectively; accordingly, CALR variants with values that are close to or above the value for wild-type CALR were classified as \u201ctype 2-like\u201d (range 26.47-36.12) and those with values close to or below the value for type 1 as \u201ctype 1-like\u201d (range 2.11-17.3). Comparison of \u201ctype 1/type 1-like\u201d ( n =110) and \u201ctype 2/type 2-like\u201d ( n =21) CALR mutations showed the latter to be associated with higher DIPSS-plus score (p=0.01), EZH2 mutations (p25 x 10(9)/L (p10 cm (p<0.01). Comparison of \u201ctype 1/type 1-like\u201d CALR and JAK2 mutations ( n =309) showed the former to be associated with younger age, higher platelet count, lower transfusion need, higher hemoglobin level, lower leukocyte count and lower DIPSS-plus score (p<0.01 for all comparisons). None of these associations was evident during comparison of \u201ctype 2/type 2-like\u201d CALR with JAK2 mutations. Survival was similar between patients with type 1 and \u201ctype 1-like\u201d (p=0.8) and between type 2 and \u201ctype 2-like\u201d (p=0.63) CALR mutations. In contrast, survival was significantly shorter in patients with type 2 (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.8) and \u201ctype 2-like\u201d (HR 3.2, 95% CI 1.0-10.6), when compared to those with type 1 CALR mutations. Survival was also significantly shorter with \u201ctype 2/type 2-like\u201d vs \u201ctype 1/type 1-like\u201d CALR mutations (p=0.003; HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4-4.5) and the difference remained significant when analysis was adjusted for age (p=0.047), ASXL1 (p=0.003) or EZH2 (p=0.001) mutations. Similarly, compared to JAK2 -mutated cases ( n =309), survival was longer in patients with \u201ctype 1/type 1-like\u201d (HR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.5) but not in those with \u201ctype 2/type 2-like\u201d (HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.5-1.6) CALR mutations; the difference in survival between JAK2 and \u201ctype 1/type 1-like\u201d CALR mutated cases remained significant (P<0.01) when analysis was adjusted for age, ASXL1 or EZH2 mutations or DIPSS-plus score. Conclusions : CALR mutations in PMF might be subclassified into type 1-like and type 2-like variants, based on predicted helical propensity of their mutant C-terminus . The favorable impact of CALR mutations in PMF might be restricted to type 1 or \u201ctype 1-like\u201d variants. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
