    "abstract_text": "Homologous deletion recombinant negative DKO mice, missing action of both Fancd2 and SMAD3 proteins were derived to test the hypothesis that abrogation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling would reverse Fanconi Anemia (FA) stem cell sensitivity to TGF-\u03b2. To determine whether DKO mouse tissues demonstrated detectable differences in production of the ligand for TGF-\u03b2 receptor, tissues from adult six - eight week old DKO mice were compared to those from Fancd2 -/- (C57BL/6J background), SMAD3 -/- (129/Sv genetic background), or wild type F1 mice (129/Sv X B6) for levels of TGF-\u03b2. Tissues examined included bone marrow, intestine, spleen, liver, muscle, and brain. Tissues were homogenized, and analyzed for bone marrow protein by Luminex analysis using a TGF beta 1 multispecies kit for Luminex Platform (Life Technologies). The results demonstrated decreased but not significant production of TGF-\u03b2 in the bone marrow of DKO mice (3068 \u00b1 753 pg TGF-\u03b2/mg protein) compared to 5211 \u00b1 1662 (p = 0.0761) for wild type F1 mice (129/Sv X B6), and 5192 \u00b1 705 (0.1085) for Fancd2 -/- mice. However, TGF-\u03b2 production in DKO was significantly decreased compared to Smad3-/- (129/Sv) mice (9828 \u00b1 1076, p = 0.0127). The lungs from DKO also had decreased TGF-\u03b2 production compared to wild type F1 mice (436 \u00b1 125 and 1159 \u00b1 44 pg/mg, respectively, p= 0.0217). Decreased TGF-\u03b2 production was also seen in the DKO liver compared to F1 wild type liver (13.2 \u00b1 1.7 and 33.5 \u00b1 3.6, respectively, p = 0.0072). Bone marrow stromal cell lines derived from long-term bone marrow cultures of each mouse strain were tested for production of TGF-\u03b2. SMAD3-/- bone marrow stromal cells also had an increased production of TGF-\u03b2 (236 pg/mg) compared to wild type F1, Fancd2-/- and DKO cell lines (117, 136 and 144 pg/ml). Bone marrow CFU-GEMM from each mouse strain was tested for sensitivity to inhibition by increasing concentrations of TGF-\u03b2, and both fresh bone marrow from DKO and SMAD3 -/- mice demonstrated no TGF-\u03b2 mediated abrogation of colony formation. In contrast, fresh marrow from wild type and Fancd2 -/- mice demonstrated TGF-\u03b2 concentration dependent inhibition of CFU-GEMM colony formation in vitro . These data indicate that TGF-\u03b2 production in DKO mice is decreased in bone marrow, lung and liver compared to that in F1 wild type, SMAD3 -/- or Fancd2 -/- mice, and suggest that the control of TGF-\u03b2 production by abrogation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in the setting of deletion of Fancd2 may be modulated in an organ specific manner.
