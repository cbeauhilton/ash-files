    "abstract_text": "Background: Despite many treatment options, multiple myeloma (MM) remains largely incurable with poor outcomes among patients who progress after treatment with a protease inhibitor, immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs), and/or an anti-CD38 antibody. Multiple targeted therapies have been developed for different subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL); however, these therapies are typically not curative for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease. IMiDs are a standard of care for treatment of MM and have shown activity in some NHL subtypes. However, given that many patients treated with these agents frequently develop disease progression, an unmet need remains. CFT7455 is a next-generation IKZF1/3 degrader, which is more potent and catalytically active than other approved agents targeting the cereblon E3 ligase complex that degrade IKZF1/3. CFT7455 is orally bioavailable and selective for IKZF1 (Ikaros) and IKZF3 (Aiolos). Depletion of these targets from malignant B cells result in tumor cell death, and depletion from the tumor microenvironment results in T-cell activation. In i n vitro and in vivo models of MM and NHL, including anaplastic large cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), CFT7455 demonstrated greater activity than other agents in similar classes. These results provided rationale for a first-in-human, phase 1 study to evaluate CFT7455. Study Design: This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1 clinical trial with dose escalation and dose expansion phases. The dose escalation phase, beginning with a starting dose of 50 mcg daily, may include single-participant cohorts at initial dose levels, after which 3-6 patients are enrolled per cohort using a Bayesian logistic regression model. After initial exploration of single-agent CFT7455 in a mixed cohort of patients with R/R MM or select NHLs, dose escalation is split to perform dose determination in R/R MM separate NHL. Once a safe dose of CFT7455 in R/R MM is determined, the combination of CFT7455 with dexamethasone will be explored in R/R MM. CFT7455 is dosed orally in 28-day cycles, on a 21-day on, 7-day off schedule, until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Expansion cohorts of single-agent CFT7455 and CFT7455 plus dexamethasone in R/R MM, and single-agent CFT7455 for peripheral T-cell lymphoma and MCL are planned. Primary objectives include: safety and tolerability, randomized phase 2 dose (RP2D)/maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CFT7455, and estimation of antitumor activity of CFT7455. Secondary objectives include assessment of pharmacokinetics. Exploratory objectives include characterization of target engagement and IKZF1/3 degradation and assessing the immunomodulatory effects of CFT7455. For MM patients, key inclusion criteria include histologically/cytologically-confirmed MM that is R/R. Patients must not be candidates for regimens known to provide clinical benefit, defined as having received \u22653 prior anti-myeloma regimens including \u22652 consecutive cycles of lenalidomide, pomalidomide, a proteasome inhibitor, a glucocorticoid, and an anti-CD38 antibody. Key exclusion criteria include the presence of central nervous system malignancy, recent venous thromboembolism or inability to undergo its prophylaxis. Plasma cell leukemia is excluded. For NHL patients, key inclusion criteria include histologically/cytologically-confirmed NHL that is R/R. Patients mustn't be candidates for regimens known to provide clinical benefit, defined as the requisite prior lines of therapy according to an indication-specific basis. Key exclusion criteria include the presence of central nervous system malignancy, recent venous thromboembolism or inability to undergo its prophylaxis. Several lymphoma subtypes less likely to benefit are excluded (eg, Richter transformation, Burkitt lymphoma, Sezary syndrome, and lymphoblastic lymphoma). Approximately 164 patients at approximately 13 US sites will be enrolled. This trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04756726, enrollment is ongoing.
