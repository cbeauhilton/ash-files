    "abstract_text": "Abstract 750 Background: DKK1 is a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway in bone that is overexpressed in a subset of newly-diagnosed MM patients with osteolytic lesions as well as in refractory and relapsed patients. Expression also correlates with the number of osteolytic lesions in untreated MM patients. BHQ880 is a novel anti-DKK1 human monoclonal antibody. Alleviation of DKK1 inhibition by BHQ880 results in activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, leading to increased bone mass mediated via upregulation of osteoblasts in mice and monkeys. In murine models of MM bone disease; this anabolic activity of BHQ880 increased trabecular and cortical bone density. Lytic bone disease in MM is caused by osteoclast activation and osteoblast inhibition. Current approved therapies for the treatment of MM bone disease are focused on osteoclast inhibition (e.g., bisphosphonates) and BHQ880 therapy may be able to reverse the effects of DKK1-induced osteoblast inhibition. Therefore, dual therapy with zoledronic acid to decrease bone resorption and BHQ880 to increase new bone formation may provide an effective treatment strategy for MM bone disease. Methods: In the phase I portion of this phase I/II study, patients with relapsed or refractory MM with prior skeletal-related event (SRE) were treated with BHQ880 as an IV infusion Q28 days. Patients also received Zol (4 mg) and approved MM Tx (bortezomib not allowed). Bone markers and total DKK1 levels along with bone mineral density are being measured. Full PK profiles were collected during the first and second cycle, after which predose (trough) samples were collected to assess accumulation. Results: Ten pts (6:M, 4:F), median age: 66.5 yrs (range 41- 70), performance status-0(5 pts), 1(4 pts), 2 (1 pts) have been enrolled in the following dose levels (mg/kg) 3 (2 pts), 10 (starting dose level -4 pts), 20 (4 pts) and have been on treatment for 1 day to 5 28-day cycles. No BHQ880-related AE's have been observed to date. Bone mineral density (BMD) data from the first two patients treated at 10 mg show the following: a.) Pt 1 (hip +5.8%, spine N/A due to surgery, wrist -1.8%); b.) Pt 2 (hip -0.2%, spine +6.1%, wrist not done). The biomarker data from these patients show: a.) Pt 1 shows a maximal +98% change over baseline in PINP at day 15 post-treatment, while osteocalcin (OC) changes +17% at day 15, reaching a +56% change over baseline at cycle 4 day 1; uNTx/Cr changes \u2013 43 % at cycle 2 day 15. b) Partial data from Pt 2 suggests a -44 % change in PINP and \u201373 % change in OC and a +73% change in uNTx/Cr. Baseline total DKK1 levels on 3 patients ranged from 8.8 to 21.5 ng/mL. Preliminary PK analysis is available in 1 out of 3 patients treated at 10mg/kg. The Cmax achieved after the first infusion was 165 ug/mL and 201 ug/mL after the second infusion. Calculated t1/2 was 188 hours after the first infusion and 254 hours after the second infusion. Regarding overall exposure, AUC0-672 hours after first infusion was 36081 hr*ng/mL and 48533 hr*ng/mL after the second infusion. Conclusion: BHQ880 given IV Q28 days appears to be well tolerated in combination with Zol and chosen MM Tx. Once safety of 40 mg/kg BHQ880 or the MTD dose has been determined, pts will be enrolled in the phase II portion to assess activity on a SRE endpoint. Updated safety, efficacy, bone density and biomarker data will be presented on all patients at the upcoming ASH meeting.
