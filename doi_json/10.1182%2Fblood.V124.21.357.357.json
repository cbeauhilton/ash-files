    "abstract_text": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a complex genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, multiple congenital anomalies, and genomic instability resulting in predisposition to cancer. Disruption of the FA signaling network impairs multiple genome-housekeeping processes, including DNA damage recognition and repair in interphase, DNA replication as well as high-fidelity chromosome segregation during mitosis. Recent data published by several groups, including our work ( J Clin Invest 2013 ; 123: 3839-3847), implicated FA signaling in the control of several cell division events essential for chromosomal stability, including the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), centrosome maintenance, resolution of ultrafine anaphase bridges and cytokinesis. Understanding the mechanistic origins of chromosomal instability leading to carcinogenesis and bone marrow failure has important scientific and clinical implications. However, the relative contribution of the interphase and mitotic events leading to genomic instability in Fanconi anemia has not been systematically evaluated. In this work, we dissected the origins and mechanistic significance of chromosomal instability in Fanconi anemia ex vivo and in vivo . We employed the cytochalasin micronucleus assay to quantify the patterns of spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced genomic lesions in FA-A patient-derived primary fibroblasts and Fancc-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In this assay, dividing cells are treated with cytochalasin to inhibit cytokinesis and generate binucleated daughter cells. The presence of micronuclei in the resulting cells is indicative of genomic instability caused by either interphase DNA damage or chromosome mis-segregation. Centromere-negative micronuclei (CNMs) represent chromosomal fragments due to unresolved ds-DNA damage. Centromere-positive micronuclei (CPMs) result from whole-chromosome mis-segregation during mitosis. The frequency of both CPMs and CNMs was significantly increased in FA-deficient human and murine cells compared to gene-corrected isogenic control cells. These results indicate that genomic instability in FA is caused by a combination of interphase DNA damage and disordered mitosis. We confirmed the biological significance of these findings by showing that FA patient cells are hypersensitive to low concentrations of taxol (a spindle checkpoint-activating chemotherapeutic) similarly to mitomycin C (a cross-linking agent). Finally, we found increased frequency of micronuclei in Fancc-/- murine red blood cells compared to age-matched wild-type mice, which indicates that spontaneous chromosome mis-segregation occurs in FA-deficient bone marrow in vivo . Our study supports the emerging model of the FA family of proteins as holistic guardians of the genome during interphase and mitosis (see figure based on F1000Prime Rep . 2014; 6: 23, modified). This model furthers our understanding of genomic instability in Fanconi anemia and FA-deficient cancers, and opens new inroads towards targeted therapeutic interventions in these diseases.
