    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4287 Introduction\u25a1F The safety of these nano-systems for human body should be carefully studied for the potential clinical application. Here in this report, we firstly study the effect of anticancer drug daunorubicin (DNR) and Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) for the neurotoxicity of rat brain. The microdialysis experiment gave the precise and real-time method to investigate the effect. Method: SD rats(240\u2013250 g) were randomly assigned to three groups containing three rats in each group. Microdialysis Probes were deployed corpus striatum. Then the animals were solitary breed to recovery the wound for about 24 h. The different drugs systems were administered by vena caudalis injection. Amino acids were measured in dialysates by HPLC. Results: The results indicated that the anticancer drug DNR had the serious bad effect for the rat brain to cause the neurotoxicity by influencing the concentration changes of amino acids in which some excitatory amino acids (such as Asp) and the inhibiting amino acid (such as Gly) especially decreased and the inhibiting amino acid GABA increased. For the system of nanocomposites for DNR conjugated with Fe3O4 NPs, the side effect of DNR for these amino acids was visibly cut down, and the time for DNR to affect the side neurotoxicity for the rat brain was shorten. Conclusion\u25a1F So these nanocomposites for DNR conjugated with Fe3O4 NPs had the better biocompatibility and biosecurity in the application of cancer therapy in vitro and in vivo. These nanocomposites system had the potential prospect to be further studied and utilized in the clinic therapy. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
