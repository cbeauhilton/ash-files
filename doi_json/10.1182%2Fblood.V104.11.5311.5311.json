    "abstract_text": "In order to contain costs, MDs must first identify the clinical factors contributing to increased resource utilization associated with an autologous stem cell transplant. We performed a retrospective clinical and cost analysis of all autologous transplants performed at Dartmouth- Hitchcock Medical Center over a 30 month period (2002-2004) and identified patients who had a prolonged length of stay > 25 d (PLOS). We pinpointed the clinical characteristics and hospital course of each patient to identify trends. The hospital cost-accounting system highlighted resource utilization and costs of the transplants, allowing a comparison between patients with a PLOS and all other transplant patients.

The average daily costs are $4252. The PLOS cohort had grade > 3 toxicity, increased infection rate, engrafted later and required more transfusional support. 1 pt was transferred to the ICU for temporary management. Of the 29 patients identified with PLOS, none died and all were discharged from the hospital. 45% of NHL/HD patients experienced a prolonged LOS, representing 68% of the PLOS cohort. The median LOS25d is 30.5d. At an average daily cost of $4252, these additional 10.5 days of hospitalization costs are substantial. Based on these findings, identification of factors underlying PLOS in the NHL/HD cohort may provide the key to minimizing cost of autologous stem cell transplant. Accordingly, we are assessing the impact of age, number of pre-transplant treatment regimens, number of peripheral blood stem cells reinfused, use of IL-2 for post-transplant immune modulation, and the day 15 absolute lymphocyte count on LOS in this population.",
