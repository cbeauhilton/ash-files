    "abstract_text": "Adoptive cellular therapies using engineered chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells) are rapidly emerging as a highly effective treatment option for a variety of life-threatening hematological malignancies. Small molecule-mediated modulation of T cell differentiation during the in vitro CAR-T manufacturing process has great potential as a method to optimize the therapeutic potential of cellular immunotherapies. In animal models, T cells with a central or stem memory (T CM/SCM ) phenotype display enhanced in vivo efficacy and persistence relative to other T cell subpopulations. We sought to identify small molecules that promote skewing towards a T CM/SCM phenotype during the CAR-T manufacturing process, with associated enhanced viability, expansion and metabolic profiles of the engineered cells. To this end, we developed a high-throughput functional screening platform with primary human T cells using a combination of high-content immunophenotyping and gene expression-based readouts to analyze cells following a high-throughput T cell culture platform that represents a scaled-down model of clinical CAR-T cell production. Multicolor flow cytometry was used to measure expansion, cell viability and the expression levels of cell surface proteins that define T CM cells ( e.g., CCR7, CD62L and CD27) and markers of T cell exhaustion ( e.g. , PD1, LAG3, and TIM3). In parallel, a portion of each sample was evaluated using high content RNA-Seq based gene expression analysis of ~100 genes representing key biological pathways of interest. A variety of known positive and negative control compounds were incorporated into the high-throughput screens to validate the functional assays and to assess the robustness of the 384-well-based screening. The ability to simultaneously correlate small molecule-induced changes in protein and gene expression levels with impacts on cell proliferation and viability of various T cell subsets, enabled us to identify multiple classes of small molecules that favorably enhance the therapeutic properties of CAR-T cells. Consistent with results previously presented by Perkins et al. (ASH, 2015), we identified multiple PI3K inhibitors that could modify expansion of T cells while retaining a T CM/SCM phenotype. In addition, we identified small molecules, and small molecule combinations, that have not been described previously in the literature that could improve CAR-T biology. Several of the top hits from the screens have been evaluated across multiple in vitro ( e.g., expansion, viability, CAR expression, serial restimulation/killing, metabolic profiling, and evaluation of exhaustion markers) and in vivo ( e.g., mouse tumor models for persistence and killing) assays. Results from the initial screening hits have enabled us to further refine the optimal target profile of a pharmacologically-enhanced CAR-T cell. In addition, we are extending this screening approach to identify small molecules that enhance the trafficking and persistence of CAR-T cells for treating solid tumors. In conclusion, the approach described here identifies unique small molecule modulators that can modify CAR-T cells during in vitro expansion, such that improved profiles can be tracked and selected from screening through in vitro and in vivo functional assays.
