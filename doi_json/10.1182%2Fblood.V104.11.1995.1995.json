    "abstract_text": "Interactions between the histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) suberanoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and sodium butyrate (SB) and the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) antagonist 17-AAG have been examined in Bcr-Abl + human leukemia cells (K562 and LAMA84), including those sensitive and resistant to STI571. Co-administration of 17-AAG with SAHA or SB for 24 h synergistically induced mitochondrial dysfunction (cytochrome c and AIF release), caspase-3 and -8 activation, apoptosis, and growth inhibition. Similar effects were observed in LAMA84 cells and K562 cells resistant to STI-571 as well as in CD34 + leukemic cells obtained from patients with CML including those who had developed a resistance against STI-571. These events were associated with increased association of Bcr/abl, Raf-1, and Akt with Hsp70, whereas the total level of these proteins markedly decreased. A pronounced inactivation of ERK1/2, and activation of JNK were also observed. In addition, 17-AAG/SAHA abrogated DNA binding and transcriptional activities of STAT5 in K562 cells, including those ectopically expressing a constitutively active STAT5A construct. Co-administration of 17-AAG and SAHA also induced downregulation of Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, B-Raf, and p21 CIP1 , upregulation of Bak, cleavage of 14-3-3 proteins, and a profound conformational change in Bax accompanied by translocation to the membrane fraction. Together, these findings raise the possibility that combining HDACIs with the Hsp90 antagonist 17-AAG may represent a novel strategy against Bcr-Abl + leukemias, including those resistant to STI571.",
