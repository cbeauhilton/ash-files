    "abstract_text": "Introduction PAM score is a simple tool for predicting mortality risk in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Originally developed and validated at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, this has recently been validated in 276 patients from Japan. We retrospectively evaluated this in our cohort of T deplete myeloablative allogeneic transplants as there are no published studies validating PAM score in T deplete myeloablative setting. Results After a median follow up of 63 months 51% of the patients are alive. The predicted mortality for category 2, 3 and 4 patients via PAM score was 28%, 48% and 28% respectively. This was concordant with the predicted mortality at 2yrs for category 2 and 3. Category 4 was not concordant (Chi-square test, P=0.0035). Characteristics . N=51 .
