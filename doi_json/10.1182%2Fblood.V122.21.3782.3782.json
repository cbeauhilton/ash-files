    "abstract_text": "Chromosomal rearrangements involving the H3K4 methyltransferase MLL trigger aberrant gene expression programs in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and give rise to an aggressive subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that is associated with intermediate or poor survival. Insights into MLL fusion-mediated leukemogenesis have not yet translated into better therapies in the clinic, in part because mutant MLL is difficult to target directly and it is incompletely understood which of the genes affected by altered epigenetic regulation in MLL-rearranged AML are responsible for malignant transformation. To search for essential signaling pathways in MLL-rearranged AML that might serve as new therapeutic targets, we performed loss-of-function RNA interference (RNAi) screens in 5 AML cell lines (NOMO-1, THP-1, OCI-AML3, HL-60, U937) using a lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library, and observed that the cell cycle regulator CDK6, but not its functional homolog CDK4, was preferentially required by MLL-AF9 pos NOMO-1 and THP-1 cells. The enhanced CDK6 dependence of MLL-rearranged cells was confirmed in an expanded panel of AML cell lines (MLL-rearranged, n=6; MLL wildtype [WT], n=4) that also included cell lines harboring other MLL fusions (MLL-AF4 and MLL-AF6), and the RNAi-induced phenotype was countered by overexpression of an shRNA-resistant CDK6 cDNA. Stable knockdown of MLL-AF9 in MLL-AF9 pos cell lines and overexpression of MLL-AF9 in WT MLL-expressing cell lines, normal human CD34 pos cells, or Ba/F3 murine pro-B cells led to concordant changes in CDK6 mRNA and protein levels that resembled those of HOXA9, a known MLL-AF9 target, indicating that CDK6 is rendered essential via transcriptional activation by truncated MLL. Analysis of cell cycle distribution, apoptosis induction, and myeloid differentiation demonstrated that the differential growth-inhibitory effect of CDK6 suppression was mainly attributable to myeloid differentiation, as MLL-AF9 pos cell lines upregulated CD11b expression and assumed a more mature, macrophage-like morphology upon CDK6 knockdown, effects not observed in WT MLL-expressing cells. Furthermore, the immature phenotype of NOMO-1 cells could be rescued by overexpression of an shRNA-resistant CDK6 cDNA. Consistent with the observations in AML cell lines, knockdown of Cdk6 also impaired the proliferation and in vitro clonogenic activity of primary murine bone marrow (BM) cells stably transduced with MLL-AF9, whereas cells expressing another leukemogenic fusion gene ( MOZ - TIF2 ) and Ba/F3 cells were largely unaffected. We also expressed MLL-AF9 in unfractionated BM derived from Cdk6 knockout mice and observed that colony numbers were gradually reduced in cultures initiated with Cdk6 +/- and Cdk6 -/- BM compared to WT BM. Furthermore, most of the colonies obtained were small and displayed loose morphology in contrast to the large, dense, blast-like colonies seen in cultures initiated with transduced WT BM. We are currently investigating whether Cdk6 is also required for AML development and propagation in vivo using a murine BM transplantation model of MLL-AF9-induced leukemia. The context-dependent effects of lowering CDK6 expression could be recapitulated in cell lines and primary human AML specimens using palbociclib (also known as PD-0332991), a small-molecule inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6 enzymatic activity that is in clinical development as an anticancer agent. We are currently devising strategies to combine this compound with cytotoxic chemotherapy as well as other targeted therapeutics, such as small-molecule bromodomain inhibitors, to maximize killing of MLL-rearranged AML cells. Together, our data (1) identify CDK6 as a critical and potentially \u201cactionable\u201d effector of MLL fusion proteins in leukemogenesis, (2) link the catalytic activity of CDK6 to arrested myeloid differentiation in MLL-rearranged AML, and (3) underscore that cell cycle regulators thought to normally act redundantly may have distinct functions in different genetic contexts.
