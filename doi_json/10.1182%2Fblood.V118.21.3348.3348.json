    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3348 Introduction: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a multifactorial disease, and increased levels of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) has been demonstrated as risk factor for first and recurrent episodes of VTE. Some authors reported that these high levels of FVIII were still persistent after 4 years of the episode, but median follow-up in these studies are relatively short. The aim of the study was investigate if after a long-term follow-up of 4\u201315 years (median of 10 years), patients with high levels of FVIII after anticoagulant treatment still showed this alteration. Design and Methods: Previously, we selected 174 adult patients with a first episode of acute VTE between January 1990 and September 2004. One hundred seventy four healthy adult individuals selected from blood donors were chosen as controls, from the same geographic area of origin. Of this group of VTE patients, 68 patients with plasma FVIII: C levels above the 90th percentile were selected. FVIII levels (FVIII:C) were measured by a one-stage clotting assay with FVIII-deficient plasma in duplicate in an automated coagulometer. Levels were measured twice, in 2004 and then in 2011. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were determined in the same samples by a nephelometric method to evaluate the influence of inflammation on FVIII levels. For individuals with CRP values higher than 1mg/dL, an additional blood sample was analyzed. High FVIII levels were only considered for further analysis when in the presence of normal CRP levels. The presence of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) was evaluated and classified clinically by the Clinical-Etiologic-Anatomic-Pathophysiologic (CEAP) classification System. Results: 68 patients with VTE and high levels of FVIII (19M:49F) with a median age of 47 years (range 20\u201370) were included in the study. The control group consisted of 59 subjects (42M:17F) with a median age of 35 years (range 21\u201356 years). VTE was spontaneous in 26 (38.2%) patients and secondary to an acquired risk factor in 61.8%. In the 1 st evaluation, in 2004, patients with VTE had higher plasma levels of FVIII:C (median 235.8 IU/dL vs. 127.0 IU/dL; p<0.001) compared to controls. In 2011, seven years after the first evaluation and after a median follow-up of 10 years after the first VTE episode, this difference was still present (median 144.6 IU/dL vs. 96.4 IU/dL; p<0.001). Patients with severe PTS (167 IU/dL) showed higher plasma levels of FVIII when compared with patients without PTS (median 141.4 IU/dL), mild PTS patients (median 142.8 IU/dL), and moderate PTS patients (median 143.2); p=0.04. Conclusions: Our results show that even after a median of 10 years of VTE, patients still have increased levels of FVIII. Moreover, there seems to be a relationship between severe post-thrombotic syndrome and increased plasma levels of FVIII. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
