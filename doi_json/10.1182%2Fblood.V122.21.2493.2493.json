    "abstract_text": "DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) play an important role in regulation of DNA methylation and mutations of DNMT3A are frequently found in AML. In previous studies using a tetracycline-inducible DNMT3B mouse model, we could show that overexpression of DNMT3B affected leukemia initiation and maintenance upon retroviral transduction and serial transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with MSCV-MLL-AF9-GFP and MSCV-cmyc-bcl2-mcherry oncogenic vectors, respectively. Sublethally irradiated recipient mice of DNMT3B overexpressing MLL-AF9 and cmyc/bcl2 leukemic cells developed leukemia with a prolonged latency when compared to recipients of wildtype cells. We performed serial transplantation assays of MLL-AF9 leukemic stem cells, which were sorted for high expression of ckit. The life-prolonging effect of DNMT3B expression was stem cell-specific, as the potential to initiate leukemia was maintained upon serial retransplantation and recipients of DNMT3B overexpressing leukemic stem cells also died significantly later in secondary (p<0.001) and tertiary transplantations (p<0.001). Analysis of global DNA methylation levels in MLL-AF9 ckit+ leukemic stem cells and cmyc/bcl2 leukemic cells via Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) revealed a strong hypermethylation in DNMT3B overexpressing cells, independent of the oncogene used for leukemia induction. Differentially methylated CpG sites were defined as CpGs with at least 20% methylation difference between wildtype and DNMT3B overexpressing samples. Hypermethylation in MLL-AF9 leukemic cells directly correlated with observed hypermethylation in cmyc/bcl2 leukemic cells and inversely correlated with hypomethylation in cmyc/bcl2 cells, indicating that in both leukemias, the same sites are prone to DNMT3B induced DNA methylation. To investigate, if these changes in DNA methylation resulted in different gene expression patterns, we performed microarray analysis of the same MLL-AF9 leukemic wildtype and DNMT3B expressing samples which were also used for DNA methylation analysis. In microarray analyses, we could identify several genes differentially expressed in DNMT3B overexpressing cells when compared to wildtype samples. Interestingly, changes in expression levels could not be attributed to differential DNA methylation in promoter regions. Instead, hypermethylation in exons and gene bodies resulted in downregulation of the respective genes, whereas genes with hypomethylated exons and gene bodies showed higher expression levels. Genes downregulated in DNMT3B overexpressing cells, were mainly cancer-associated genes, which are known to have functions in cellular growth and proliferation, as well as in the hematopoietic system development and maintenance. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of wildtype cells revealed a strong enrichment of genes upregulated in different stages of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells as well as in leukemic stem cells, whereas DNMT3B overexpressing samples were enriched in genes which have been shown to be downregulated in hematopoietic and leukemic stem cells and upregulated in mature hematopoietic cells. This strengthens our hypothesis that DNMT3B induced DNA methylation mainly influences the phenotype and function of hematopoietic stem cells and thereby, exerts its inhibitory function on leukemia initiation and maintenance. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that DNMT3B exerts its anti-leukemic effect mainly via induction of aberrant DNA methylation in hematopoietic and leukemic stem cells, thereby changing expression patterns of genes known to be important for stem cell function. The identification of differentially expressed DNMT3B target genes could help to find promising targets for new therapeutic strategies in AML.
