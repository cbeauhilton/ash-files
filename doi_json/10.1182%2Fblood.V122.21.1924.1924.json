    "abstract_text": "While direct inhibition of Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-x L is an exciting new approach in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, current agents in clinical testing including navitoclax (ABT-263) and ABT-199 are not predicted to be efficacious in most cases of multiple myeloma. Navitoclax and the related molecule ABT-737 promote apoptosis by releasing the pro-apoptotic BH3 only protein Bim from Bcl-2 and Bcl-x L , but are incapable of disrupting the interaction between Bim and Mcl-1, the predominant anti-apoptotic protein in both normal and malignant plasma cells. However, despite their dependence on Mcl-1, some human myeloma cell lines (HMCL) as well as freshly isolated patient-derived myeloma cells are sensitive to ABT-737 in vitro. Knowing that myeloma normally requires the bone marrow niche for survival, we hypothesized that a stromal derived factor might mediate the resistance to ABT-737 in vivo and identified IL-6 as a key resistance factor. In our initial experiments, the HS-5 stromal cell line induced resistance to ABT-737 in the HMCL MM.1s, as did conditioned media from both HS-5 cells and patient derived bone marrow stromal cells. Blocking IL-6 with an IL-6 neutralizing antibody reversed the protective effect of conditioned media, while addition of 10 ng/ml IL-6 protected cells to the same degree as conditioned media. In order to understand the mechanisms of IL-6 mediated resistance to ABT-737, we have focused on the effect of IL-6 on the Bcl-2 family of proteins. In previous work from our lab, the ABT-737 sensitive HMCLs KMS18, MM.1s, and 8226 all showed increased binding of Bim to Bcl-2 and Bcl-x L compared to ABT-737 resistant lines. We therefore examined the effect of IL-6 on the distribution of Bim among Bcl-2, Bcl-x L , and Mcl-1. In KMS18, stimulation with 10 ng/ml IL-6 for 24 hours increases binding of Bim to Mcl-1. The increased binding correlates with a 2 fold increased Mcl-1 expression at both the RNA and protein level. The increased Mcl-1 expression in response to IL-6 may be limited to KMS18 as it was not observed in MM.1s, 8226, or KMS11. IL-6 also does not prevent ABT-737 from disrupting the interaction between Bim and Bcl-x L . We also examined Bim for IL-6 induced post-translational modifications that could alter its binding to Bcl-2 proteins. Bim is known to be phosphorylated on serine 69 by Erk in response to growth factor stimulation. We observed Bim serine 69 phosphorylation within 5 minutes of IL-6 stimulation in both KMS18 and MM.1s cells. Phosphorylation was reversible with 10 \u03bcM of the MEK inhibitor U0126. Although serine 69 phosphorylation has been reported to result in Bim degradation, we do not observe any change in Bim levels over the course of 24 hours. Interestingly, the MEK inhibitor sensitized both KMS18 and MM.1s to ABT-737 and was able to partially overcome IL-6 induced resistance. Inhibition of Akt with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 had no effect on Bim serine 69 phosphorylation or IL-6 induced resistance. Of note, the MEK inhibitor failed to prevent upregulation of Mcl-1 in KMS18, suggesting an alternative pathway mediates this effect. We are currently studying the role of JAK signaling in Mcl-1 expression with the inhibitors AZD1480 and ruxolitinib, and are also extending our results to additional cell lines and patient samples. These results suggest that targeting IL-6 or its downstream pathways may sensitize myeloma to Bcl-2 antagonists such as ABT-199 and navitoclax.
