    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1656 Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive type of B-cell lymphoma characterized by a t(11;14)(q13;q32) chromosomal translocation resulting in a constitutive over-expression of cyclin D1. Cyclin D1 is a multifunctional protein not only regulating cell cycle progression but also affecting other cellular functions including glucose and lipid metabolism. In this study, we investigated the effects of the fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitors orlistat and C75 on viability of different MCL cell lines including JEKO-1, MINO, Granta-519, JVM-2, and Rec-1. In all cell lines inhibition of FASN alone induced apoptosis. In contrast, normal peripheral blood lymphocytes were resistant to these compounds. This proapoptotic effect was dependent on cyclin D1 as silencing of cyclin D1 partially rescued cells from induction of cell death following FASN inhibition. Inhibition of FASN led to a strong induction of the proapoptotic protein NOXA (PMAIP) in all MCL cell lines investigated independent of the p53 status. Pre-treatment of cells with NOXA siRNA significantly reduced induction of cell death demonstrating the predominant role of this proapoptotic protein for the observed effects. We then analyzed the combined effects of inhibition of FASN with a panel of compounds with potential clinical relevance. Combination of FASN inhibitors with the BH3 mimetic ABT737, the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib, and the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) led to an almost complete loss of viability. These combinatory effects were selective for MCL cells as the same treatments had almost no effects on cell viability of primary PBMCs or fibroblasts from healthy donors. Bortezomib, 2-DG, and ABT737 enhanced the proapoptotic effect of FASN inhibitors by further disturbing the balance of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins: FASN inhibitor mediated induction of NOXA was enhanced by Bortezomib whereas 2-DG significantly reduced the NOXA antagonist Mcl-1. In summary, our results suggest that FASN inhibitors exert significant antitumoral activity especially in combination with Bcl-2 family modulators in different MCL cell lines and may therefore represent an attractive model for the design of new therapeutic approaches for this entity.
