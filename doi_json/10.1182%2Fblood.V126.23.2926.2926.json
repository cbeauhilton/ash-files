    "abstract_text": "Background Severe cytopenias in CLL are typically associated with bone marrow failure due to massive infiltration of the bone marrow by leukemic cells and negatively impact patient morbidity/mortality. Although near complete marrow replacement by CLL is typically observed in patients whose degree of cytopenia meet criteria for advanced Rai stage disease (Hg<11g/dL; platelet <100 x10^9/L), profound variability in the degree of cytopenia and the extent of marrow infiltration exists, and the relationship between these dimensions is not well characterized. Methods We used the Mayo Clinic CLL database to identify all previously untreated CLL/SLL patients who underwent bone marrow biopsies. CLL patients known to have autoimmune-based cytopenias were excluded from this study. Hemoglobin, platelets, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), and absolute monocyte (AMC) at the time of bone marrow biopsy were collected. Characteristics from bone marrow biopsy including marrow cellularity, % CLL involvement, CLL leukemic index (calculated as % cellularity times % CLL), and non-CLL leukemic index (calculated as % cellularity times (1-% CLL)) were also collected. Bone marrow cellularity and % CLL involvement were recorded in the Mayo Clinic CLL database based on clinical estimates made by Mayo hematopathologists. Clinical characteristics and CLL prognostic factors (e.g., Rai stage, CLL FISH, IGHV, ZAP-70, CD38 and CD49d) were also obtained from the database. Age- and sex-adjusted Pearson correlations between the bone marrow measurements and hemoglobin and platelet levels were computed, and scatterplots were created. Results A total of 695 untreated CLL patients diagnosed between 1972 and 2015 who had a CBC test at the time of bone marrow biopsy performed at Mayo Clinic were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 61 years, and 487 (70%) patients were men. Mean time from CLL diagnosis to bone marrow biopsy was 2.2 years. At the time bone marrow biopsy was performed, 20% of patients had advanced stage disease (Rai III/IV) disease, while 44% and 36% had intermediate (Rai I/II) and early stage (Rai 0), respectively. With respect to prognostic parameters, 53% had unmutated IGHV and 20% had high risk CLL FISH (11q- and 17p-). The distribution of other prognostic factors included 43% CD49d+, 35% CD38+, and 42% ZAP-70+ CLL diseases. Median peripheral blood counts were: hemoglobin 13g/dL, platelet 167,000/mL, ALC 26,600/mL, ANC 4100/mL, AMC 700/mL. The median bone marrow cellularity and percent CLL involvement were 70% and 70%, respectively. The median CLL leukemic index was 42%, and median non-CLL leukemic index was 21%. Pearson correlation analysis of bone marrow measurements with peripheral blood hemoglobin found the strongest correlation with the CLL leukemic index (r= -0.49, p<0.001) (Figure), followed by the % marrow CLL involvement (r= -0.45, p<0.001), cellularity (r= -0.40, p<0.001), and non-CLL leukemic index (r= 0.37, p<0.001). Pearson correlation analysis of the bone marrow measurements with platelet count also found the strongest correlation with the CLL leukemic index (r= -0.39, p<0.001), followed by % marrow CLL involvement (r= -0.38, p<0.001), non-CLL leukemic index (r= 0.35, p<0.001), and cellularity (r= -0.28, p<0.001). The peripheral blood ANC levels did not correlate with the four bone marrow measurements. Age- and sex-adjusted Pearson correlations between the bone marrow measurements and hemoglobin and platelet levels were similar to the above unadjusted results. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the relationship between peripheral blood counts and the extent of bone marrow infiltration in patients with CLL. Although the bone marrow leukemic index had the strongest correlation with peripheral blood Hg and platelet counts, the correlation was modest with an r value of -0.49. These findings suggest that the extent of infiltration of the bone marrow by CLL cells only partially explains of the anemia and thrombocytopenia observed in CLL, indicating other biologic interactions between CLL B-cells and hematopoietic cells contribute to anemia and thrombocytopenia in these patients. More research is needed to determine the nature of these interactions. Disclosures Ding: Merek: Research Funding.
