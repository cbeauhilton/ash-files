    "abstract_text": "Despite the significant improvement in outcomes for myeloma patients (pts) in the more recent years (yrs), the disease remains incurable. Because of high morbidity and mortality the role of allo-SCT in treatment of myeloma remains controversial. Registry data from the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) suggest an increasing use of allo-SCT as salvage therapy after failure to auto-SCT. In present single center study we provide data on the use of allo-SCT focusing on pts with first relapse/progressive disease after autografting. A total of 89 pts (males, 62%) with median age of 53y (24-73) relapsed after an autograft (single, 64%; tandem, 36%) and received an allo-SCT during 2000 - 2015 yrs at University of Hamburg were included. The majority of the pts experienced advanced disease (stage III, 80%) and short remission duration after auto-SCT (\u226424 mo, 81%) with median of 15 mo (2-91). A total of 76% of pts received a reinduction therapy prior to allo-SCT, whereas 24% did not. Twelve pts (14%) had high risk cytogenetics (defined as detection of del17p and/or t(4;14) by FISH). Twelve pts experienced extramedullary relapses. At time of transplantation pts were in CR (10%), vgPR (22%), PR (27%), SD (16%) or PD (25%). Allo-SCTs were performed mostly with peripheral stem cell (92%) and from unrelated (matched, 40%; mismatched, 32%) donors. Myeloablative conditioning was used in 70% of pts (busulfan-based, 61%; treosulfan-based, 9%). A total of 28 pts (31%) received a maintenance therapy (lenalidomide, 79%) starting at median 6 mo (4-8) post-transplant. Furthermore, 19 pts (24%) received DLIs (positive immunofixation, n=15; prophylaxis, n=4) within a median of 10 mo (4-27). The cumulative incidence (CI) of acute GvHD (grade II-IV) at d100 was 43% (32-55%). The CI of chronic GvHD at 5y post-transplant was 51% (39-63%; mild, n=19, moderate, n=12, severe, n=5). Of the 19 pts receiving DLIs, 5 (26%) developed GvHD (grade II-IV). Six (40%) of 15 pts responded (CR). The CI of TRM at d100 and at 5y were 8% (4-16%) and 19% (12-28%), respectively. We observed improved TRM in pts who didn't receive radiation before allo-SCT (p=0,03). The CI of relapses at 5y was 61% (49-72%). We observed a trend to lower relapse rate of 29% in pts with longer remission duration (>24 mo, p=0,07). The 5y probability of EFS was 28% (19-39%). The median EFS was 29 mo (22-36). In univariate analysis, we observed decreased survival probability for pts with high risk cytogenetics (p=0,026), remission duration \u226424 mo (p=0,008) and non-responders to salvage therapy (p=0,037). In multivariate analysis the negative impact of remission duration \u226424 mo (HR 6,9; 1,8-25,6; p=0,004) and failure to salvage therapy (HR 3,3; 1,2-9,0; p=0,021) were confirmed. In landmark analysis at d100 we observed improved survival for responding pts (p<0,001), pts in CR (p=0,028), those in \"stringent\" CR compared to CR (p=0,014) and those with negative MRD (minimal residual disease, FACS, p=0,037). Intriguingly, the median EFS for pts in \"stringent\" CR was not reached. In landmark analysis at 6 mo we observed improved survival for pts receiving preemptive/prophylactic DLIs (p=0,045). After a median follow up of 48 mo (6-170), the 5y probability of OS was 57% (46-78%). The median OS was 76 mo (42-110). In univariate analysis, we observed decreased survival probability for pts with extramedullary relapse (p=0,039), high risk cytogenetics (p=0,001), remission duration \u22646 mo (p=0,044) and those who received reduced intensity conditioning (p=0,022). In multivariate analysis the negative impacts of extramedullary relapses (HR 7,3; 2,7-20; p<0,001), reduced intensity conditioning (HR 3,5; 1,4-8,5; p=0,006) and short remission duration (HR 2,6; 1,1 - 6,2; p=0,038) were confirmed. In landmark analysis at d100 we observed improved survival for responding pts (p<0,001), pts in CR (p=0,028) and those in \"stringent\" CR compared to CR (p=0,014). In landmark analysis at 6 mo we observed improved survival for pts receiving DLIs (p<0,001) and maintenance therapy (p=0,002). Allo-SCT being performed as salvage therapy after autograft failure resulted in around 30% 5y EFS. The response on d100 post-transplant, augmented by the MRD detection, seems to be prognostic important and might be used for planning further therapeutic strategies post-transplant. The use of DLIs and maintenance therapy post-transplant represent a possible approach to further improve survival.
