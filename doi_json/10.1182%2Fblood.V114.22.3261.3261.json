    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3261 Poster Board III-1 A crucial role of segmental duplications (SDs) of the human genome has been demonstrated in chromosomal rearrangements associated with several genomic disorders. Limited knowledge is yet available on the molecular processes resulting in chromosomal rearrangements in tumors. The t(9;22)(q34;q11) causing the 5'BCR/3'ABL gene formation has been detected in more than 90% of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cases. Some years ago, a 76-kb duplicon was reported, closely located to both ABL and BCR genes which are involved in the t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation associated with CML. However, the exact role of this duplicon in mediating the t(9;22) rearrangement remained mostly speculative. In 10\u201318% of CML patients genomic deletions were detected on der(9) chromosome next to translocation breakpoints. The molecular mechanism triggering the t(9;22) and deletions on der(9) is still unknown. Our study presents an experimental evidence of the involvement of SDs in the genesis of the t(9;22) translocation in CML and in the occurrence of genomic deletions on der(9) chromosome. We identified 71 (17%) cases with der(9) deletions by FISH screening of 416 CML patients at diagnosis. Fine-mapping of deletions was performed using appropriate bacterial and Phage P1-derived artificial chromosome clones. The deletions sizes were heterogeneous, ranging from 230 Kb to 12.9 Mb on chromosome 22 and from 260 Kb to 41.8 Mb on chromosome 9. The mapping of all breakpoints revealed an evident breakpoints clustering, on both chromosomes 9 and 22, in two regions of about 2 Mb in size. Indeed, these regions contained the breakpoints detected in 54 out of 60 (90%) patients bearing chromosome 9 deletions and in all patients with chromosome 22 sequences loss. Bioinformatic analysis of chromosome 9 and chromosome 22 genomic regions involved in the deletions was performed to search for features that could correlate with the breakpoints clustering. To this aim, the breakpoint regions were subdivided into 250 Kb intervals. The most striking result was the fact that both clusters contain the above reported 76-kb duplicon, shared by chromosome 9 and 22 (SD_9/22). The SD_9/22 is the only duplication located inside the breakpoints clustering region on chromosome 9, whereas the chromosome 22 clustering region harbors several duplications. A remarkable feature of the chromosome 9 clustering region was the high frequency of Alu repeats. The mean Alu frequency overall on chromosome 9 is 10.8%, whereas the average Alu content on this cluster is 31.3%. Accordingly, as expected, the content in LINE sequences of the region was relatively low (average overall on chromosome 9: 21.2%, as opposed to 8.7% on the cluster region). Gene distribution analysis of chromosome 9 and 22 showed that both SD_9/22 map inside gene-poor regions, of about 460 Kb and 250 Kb in size, respectively. To corroborate the observations on the distribution of SDs and Alu/LINE repeats, the chromosome 9 and 22 regions surrounding the SD_9/22 were once more divided into 250 Kb segments, positioning the SD_9 and SD_22 as landmarks. A statistically significant negative association was observed between the number of breaks and the distance from SD_9/22, on both chromosomes 9 (p=0.01) and 22 (p=0.006), respectively. The relationship between the breaks and the interspersed repeats revealed, on chromosome 9, a positive linear regression with Alu repeats (p=0.04), and a negative one with LINEs (p=0.04). Very similar conclusions were obtained by comparing the distance from the SD_9 and the Alu (p= 0.03, positive) and LINE distribution (p=0.02, negative). No statistically significant relationship was observed on chromosome 22. In our study the involvement of SDs was proposed to explain the recurrent t(9;22) translocation in CML and the genomic deletions that could accompany the rearrangement. Although the chromosomes 9 and 22 breakpoints clustering regions are quite large, the strong non-randomness of SD_9/22 location and the genomic features identified in our work suggest that the chromosomal segments near the ABL and BCR genes are brought together by an active process, facilitating recombination. At the light of these findings, the analysis of secondary non-recurrent events could represent a new methodological approach able to identify architectural elements involved in the occurrence of recurrent primary rearrangements in human neoplasia.
