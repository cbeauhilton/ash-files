    "abstract_text": "Despite cytogenetic and molecular remissions, residual chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells persist in the primitive CD34+ compartment in the majority of imatinib treated patients. It has been demonstrated that CD34+ CML cells have a reduced sensitivity to imatinib induced apoptosis. Factors which may contribute to this reduced sensitivity are reduced dependence on BCR-ABL, an increase in BCR-ABL transcripts, increased expression of efflux proteins or decreased expression of drug influx proteins. Our previous studies show that a patient\u2019s intrinsic sensitivity to imatinib-induced kinase inhibition (IC50) is related to the intracellular uptake and retention (IUR) of imatinib in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The organic cation transporter 1 (OCT-1) is the major active influx transporter for imatinib in these cells, and the functional activity of this protein (determined using functional inhibition of OCT-1, in the IUR assay) directly correlates with molecular response to imatinib. In the present study we investigated the role that OCT-1 plays in stem cell resistance to imatinib. Primitive CD34+ and mature CD34\u2212 cells were isolated from CML patients and normal individuals using magnetic cell sorting. CML CD34+ cells had a significantly lower IUR imatinib than that of CML CD34\u2212 cells (Table 1). The addition of the OCT-1 inhibitor, prazosin (100\u03bcM), eliminated this difference in IUR (Table 1), indicating that variation in IUR imatinib is due to variation in the functional activity of the OCT-1 protein. In addition, the OCT-1 Activity (Table 1) and OCT-1 mRNA expression (expressed as % of BCR: mean CD34+=0.25; CD34\u2212=4.9, p=0.040, n=10) was significantly lower in CML CD34+ cells compared with CML CD34\u2212 cells. These differences in IUR imatinib and OCT-1 activity between CD34+ and CD34\u2212 cells were not observed in normal individuals (Table 1), suggesting this phenomenon is specific to leukemic cells. Furthermore, we isolated the more primitive compartment, CD34+38\u2212 cells and less primitive CD34+38+ cells in 4 CML patients. The CD34+38\u2212 cells demonstrated a 13% reduction in IUR imatinib and a 41% reduction in OCT-1 activity compared with CD34+38+ cells. These data suggest a reduced IUR mediated by low OCT-1 function and/or expression may play a role in the resistance of CML stem cells to imatinib.

The effect of an ABCB1 inhibitor (PSC833) and ABCG2 inhibitor (Ko143) was assessed in CD34+ cells from 3 CML patients, using the IUR assay. Neither of these drugs had any effect on the IUR imatinib in CML CD34+ cells. Additionally the mRNA expression of ABCB1 did not differ between CML CD34+ and CD34\u2212 cells (expressed as a % of BCR: mean CD34+=33.7; CD34\u2212=33.77, p=0.064, n=10). These data suggest that alterations in imatinib influx (via OCT-1) are more critical for development of stem cell resistance rather than differences in efflux. We have previously demonstrated that, unlike imatinib, the OCT-1 protein is not involved in nilotinib transport, as the addition of OCT-1 inhibitors does not alter IUR nilotinib in patients. Assessing the IUR of nilotinib in CD34+ and CD34\u2212 CML cells reveals no significant difference between the two populations (Table 2). Additionally, the IUR nilotinib is significantly higher than IUR imatinib in CML CD34+ cells (Table 2). In summary, the reduced OCT-1 mediated uptake of imatinib in more primitive, CD34+ CML cells may result in inadequate kinase inhibition and contribute to stem cell resistance in CML. Since nilotinib uptake into CML CD34+ cells is not impaired in the same manner as imatinib, more substantial depletion of the primitive CML cells may be achieved.
