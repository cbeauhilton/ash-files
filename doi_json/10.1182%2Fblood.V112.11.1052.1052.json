    "abstract_text": "Background and aims . In CLL, TL has been associated to outcome. However a larger patient sample and an analysis on a blinded validation series are required to fully establish the independent prognostic value of TL and to define its impact on prognostic subgroups defined according to established predictors. These issues have been addressed on a CLL learning cohort and validated on an independent blinded cohort, overall accounting for 401 CLL patients. Also, we have tested TL as a risk factor of Richter\u2019s Syndrome (RS), an extremely severe event that most of the currently available biomarkers fail to predict. Methods. The learning series (LS) included 191 patients from the university of Torino (UT), while the blinded validation series (BVS) included 210 patients from University of Eastern Piedmont (UEP). TL was assessed on PBMC collected at diagnosis by Southern blotting and no biological or clinical feature of BVS patients was available to the laboratory performing the analysis. Detailed clinical history, clinical parameters at diagnosis as well as VH-mutational status, cytogenetics, CD38 expression and Zap-70 were available for the vast majority of patients and employed together with TL as covariates for multivariate survival analysis. Results . The two series showed no differences for any clinical and biological features except age that was slightly higher in the BVS series. Also TL distribution was similar in the two series (median TL 6024 and 5959 bp respectively). By applying ROC analysis and Youden\u2019s index to the LS we identified a cut-off point of 5000bp segregating 26% (104/401) of patients in the high-risk subgroup. TL was a powerful and independent outcome predictor for both TFS (24.6 vs 73 months p65 years, p65 years (p=.004), Binet stage B-C (p<.001), or unfavorable cytogenetics (p=.001). Conclusions. These results demonstrate that TL is a powerful independent predictor of multiple outcome events in CLL and contributes to refine the prognostic assessment of CLL when utilized in combination with other prognostic markers. We thus recommend a more widespread use of this biomarker in CLL. View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure "
