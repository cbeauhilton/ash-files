    "abstract_text": "In iron overload conditions such as thalassemia major and hereditary hemochromatosis, the iron-carrying capacity of plasma transferrin is exceeded, giving rise to non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI). NTBI is taken up preferentially by the liver, and to a lesser extent, the kidney, pancreas, and heart. How NTBI is taken up by various tissues has been elusive. We recently demonstrated that the plasma membrane metal-ion transporter SLC39A14 (ZIP14) mediates NTBI uptake and iron loading of the liver and pancreas, but not the kidney, heart or most other tissues\u00b9 Given that the heart is particularly susceptible to iron-related toxicity, we are currently investigating the contribution of other iron transporters to iron loading of this organ. Possible alternative cardiac iron importers include L-type and T-type calcium channels, divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), and SLC39A8 (ZIP8). To examine the role of DMT1 and ZIP8 in cardiac iron metabolism, we generated mice with cardiomyocyte-specific disruption of DMT1 ( Dmt1 heart/heart ) or ZIP8 ( Zip8 heart/heart ). The mice were then crossed with hemojuvelin knockout ( Hjv -/- ) mice, a model of juvenile hemochromatosis characterized by high circulating levels of NTBI. Dmt1 heart/heart mice were found to have cardiac non-heme iron concentrations that were 30% lower ( P <0.01) than those of wild-type littermate controls at 6 weeks of age. Interestingly, however, double mutant Hjv -/- ; Dmt1 heart/heart mice accumulated more cardiac non-heme iron (3.9X control) than did single-mutant Hjv -/- mice (2.3X control) at 6 weeks of age. Cardiac-specific disruption of Zip8 did not affect cardiac non-heme iron concentrations under basal conditions or when mice were crossed with Hjv -/- mice. Collectively, these data indicate that DMT1 and ZIP8 are dispensable for iron loading of the heart in a mouse model of hemochromatosis. Our data additionally suggest that DMT1 may play a role in normal cardiac iron metabolism. Reference: Jenkitkasemwong S, Wang C, Coffey R, et al.
