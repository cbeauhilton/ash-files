    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) short telomeres were shown to be associated with mutational status, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (Damle et al., 2004). Chromosomal instability increases with shortening of telomeres. Recently, a relationship between telomere length and number of chromosomal aberrations has been shown if telomere length was investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Tel-PCR) (Roos et al., 2008). The aim of the present study was to correlate average telomere length of individual cells measured by multicolor flow-FISH to established prognostic factors and genomic aberrations. PATIENTS and METHODS: Blood samples from 64 patients with CLL were analyzed. Flow cytometry was performed for quantification of ZAP-70 and CD 38 expression with a cut off at 20%. Immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IGVH) genes were sequenced. An IGVH gene sequence with less than 98% homology with the corresponding germ-line sequence was considered to be mutated. Chromosomal alterations were investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with the following gene probes: LSI 13q14, LSI 13q34, CEP 12, LSI 17p13, LSI 11q22\u201323. Copy number changes were also detected in 18 samples by SNP-chip analysis. The average length of telomere repeats at chromosome ends was measured by multicolor flow-FISH. Values of telomere length from CLL cells were correlated to values of telomere lengths of B lymphocytes from healthy age matched individuals (delta telomere length=\u0394tel). RESULTS: The average telomere length of the clonal B-cells was short. Patient samples from advanced Binet stages (B/C) had significantly shorter telomeres (\u0394tel \u22124.8 \u00b1 1.0 kb) than patients samples from Binet A (\u0394tel \u22123.4 \u00b1 1.2 kb, p=0.03). The average telomere length was significantly shorter for ZAP-70+ (\u0394tel \u22125.0 \u00b1 0.5 kb) and CD38+ (\u0394tel \u22124.9 \u00b1 0.7 kb) patient samples than for ZAP-70\u2212 (\u0394tel \u22122.4 \u00b1 0.8 kb) and CD38\u2212 (\u0394tel \u22123.0 \u00b1 1.0 kb) patient samples, respectively (p<0.005, p<0.005). IGVH unmutated CLL samples exhibited significant shorter telomere lengths (\u0394tel \u22124.8 \u00b1 0.4 kb) than mutated samples (\u0394tel \u22122.8 \u00b1 0.9 kb, p<0.005). Interestingly CLL samples harbouring del 17p and del 11q had significantly shorter average telomere length (\u0394tel \u22125.3 \u00b1 0.2 kb, n= 8) than samples without these aberrations (\u0394tel \u22124.0 \u00b1 1.2 kb; n= 56, p<0.005). Furthermore we found a tendency of an increase in the number of chromosomal aberrations detected by SNP-chip with shorter telomeres. DISCUSSION: We are able to confirm significant shorter telomeres in CLL samples with unfavourable prognostic factors like advanced Binet stage, positivity for ZAP-70 or CD38 and unmutated IGVH genes compared to their favourable counterparts. CLL samples with the chromosomal aberrations del 17p and del 11q are associated with bad clinical outcome. CLL with these aberrations of the present study demonstrated significantly shorter telomeres compared to cases without these abnormalities. Additional studies relating impact of telomere length on genomic instability detected by SNP-chip are ongoing."
