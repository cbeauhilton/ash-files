    "abstract_text": "iNKT cells are activated in mice and people with vaso-occlusive sickle cell disease (SCD) and play a pivotal role in initiating an inflammatory cascade. In mice, iNKT cell activation requires NF-\u03baB signaling [Stanic, AK et al. J Immunol. 172:4667, 2004]. In mice with SCD, lung inflammation is associated with induction in iNKT cells of IFN-\u03b3 and anti-inflammatory adenosine A 2A receptor (A 2A R) mRNAs [Wallace, KL et al. Blood 116:5010, 2010]. The A 2A R is one of four G protein coupled adenosine receptors (A 1 , A 2A , A 2B and A 3 ) and it is the most abundant adenosine receptor expressed in T cells. In patients with SCD, painful vaso-occlusive crisis (pVOC) is associated with NF-\u03baB activation and increased expression of A 2A R immunoreactivity detected with the monoclonal Ab, 7F6-G5-A2, in circulating iNKT cells. Infusion of a moderate dose (6 nM) of the A 2A R agonist, regadenoson during pVOC reduced iNKT cell activation over time [Field, J. et al. Blood 121:3329, 2013]. Since A 2A R activation inhibits iNKT cell activation, we reasoned that iNKT cell activation during pVOC might occur preferentially in iNKT cells with low A 2A R expression. However, in the current study we show that activated human V\u03b124+ CD4+ iNKT cells concordantly (i.e. on the same cells) expressed Ser-536 phosphorylated/activated NF-\u03baB (p-NF\u03baB), cytokines and A 2A Rs. These findings suggest that NF-\u03baB signaling increases A 2A R expression as a counter-regulatory mechanism to render activated iNKT cells highly sensitive to inhibition by A 2A R activation. Spare receptor theory predicts that enhanced receptor expression will increase the functional potency of agonists. To test this hypothesis we infused into stable SCD patients at steady state a low dose of regadenoson (2 nM) well below its receptor binding K D that was measured by competition for radioligand binding to be 12 nM. Low-dose regadenoson infusion reduced the percentage of p-NF-\u03baB-high/activated iNKT cells by an average of 69% over 12 hours ( P = 0.005). These findings suggest that A 2A R induction is a counter-regulatory mechanism that limits iNKT cell activation by increasing the sensitivity of activated iNKT cells to inhibition by adenosine. In order to further test the hypothesis that NF-\u03baB activation stimulates A 2A R transcription, we examined cultured human iNKT cells. Blockade of NF-\u03baB with Bay 11-7082 or IKK inhibitor VII prevented rapid induction of cytokine and A 2A R mRNA and protein upon iNKT activation by plate-bound anti-CD3 antibodies. In conclusion, NF-\u03baB-mediated induction of A 2A Rs in iNKT cells serves as a counter-regulatory mechanism to limit the extent and duration of inflammatory immune responses. We conclude that A 2A R agonists have therapeutic potential for treating inflammatory diseases associated with iNKT cell activation, including SCD.
