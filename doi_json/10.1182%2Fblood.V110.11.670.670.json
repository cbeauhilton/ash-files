    "abstract_text": "NF-\u03baB pathway plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis in cancer cells including multiple myeloma (MM). The NF-\u03baB complex is dimer in different combinations of Rel family proteins, including p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, p50 (NF-\u03baB1), and p52 (NF-\u03baB2). Recent studies have revealed that NF-\u03baB activity is mediated via two distinct pathways. In the canonical pathway, NF-kB is typically a heterodimer composed of p50 and p65 subunits. In the non-canonical pathway, NF-kB is typically a heterodimer composed of RelB and p100 subunits. We have shown anti-MM activities of IKK\u03b2 inhibitors (PS-1145, MLN120B); however, effects of these agents were modest. Our studies therefore suggest that baseline NF-kB activity in MM cells is not totally dependent on the canonical pathway, and that inhibition of only canonical NF-\u03baB pathway may not be sufficient to block total NF-kB activity. In this study, we therefore hypothesized whether non-canonical inhibitors significantly enhanced NF-\u03baB inhibition induced by canonical inhibitors in MM cells. We first examined baseline NF-\u03baB activity using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). NF-\u03baB activity varied between cell lines; for example MM.1S, MM.1R and H929 cells have higher level of NF-\u03baB activity than in RPMI8226, INA6 and OPM2 cells. To define the role of canonical and non-canonical pathway, we next examined protein expression of p50, p65 and p52 NF-\u03baB in these cell lines: p65 was highly expressed in all MM cell lines; however, expression of p50 and 52 is variable. Surprisingly, no detectable or weak expression of p50 was observed in U266, RPMI8226, LR5, H929 and OPM2 cell lines, suggesting that baseline NF-kB activity in these cell lines is not maintained only by the canonical pathway. We then attempted to block non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway in MM cell lines. Specifically since IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 are client proteins of heat shock protein (Hsp) 90, we examined whether 17AAG could inhibit expression and/or function of IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 in MM cells. Importantly, both IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 were significantly downregulated by 17AAG in MM cell lines. To determine whether downregulation of these IKK proteins by 17AAG was due to inhibition of transcription, we next performed real-time quantitative PCR and no significant inhibition of relative expression of IKK\u03b2 was observed by 17AAG treatment, suggesting that downregulation of these proteins was a post transcription event. We further examined whether 17AAG enhanced the effect of IKK\u03b2 inhibitor MLN120B on NF-\u03baB activity. Although the inhibitory effect by either MLN120B or 17AAG alone on phosphorylation (p) of I\u03baB\u03b1 triggered by TNF\u03b1 was marginal, combination treatment of MLN120B with 17AAG almost completely blocked I\u03baB\u03b1, suggesting that this combination synergistically inhibit canonical NF-\u03baB activity in MM cells. Importantly, the combination of MLN120B with 17AAG also significantly blocked baseline and TNF\u03b1-triggered NF-\u03baB activity, assessed by EMSA, in MM cells. Finally, 17AAG augmented the growth inhibitory effect of MLN120B in the context of bone marrow stromal cells. Taken together, these results showed that baseline and TNF\u03b1-triggered NF-\u03baB activities were completely blocked by this combination treatment, and provide the rationale for its clinical evaluation to induce maximum inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity and improve patient outcome in MM.",
