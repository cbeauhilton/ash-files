    "abstract_text": "Thalidomide-Dexamethasone (TD) is an active regimen both in patients (pts) with relapsing/refractory and in untreated pts with multiple myeloma (MM). Here we compare TD with standard Melphalan-Prednisone (MP) in previously untreated elderly pts with MM. 274 pts have been enrolled (median age: 72 yrs, stage I: 9 (3%), stage II: 84 (31%), stage III: 179 (65%). Pts were randomized to T 200mg/day and D 40mg, days 1\u20134 and 15\u201318 (on odd cycles) and days 1\u20134 (on even cycles) or M 0.25mg/kg days 1\u20134 and P2mg/kg days 1\u20134, q 4\u20136 weeks. T should be dosed up to 400mg/day, if feasible. Pts achieving response or SD were randomized to maintenance therapy either with T (\u2264200mg/day)-Interferon-a2b (IFN, 3Mega U, TIW) or IFN (3Mega U/TIW). Zoledronic acid (4mg) was administered monthly to all pts during the entire treatment period. Response is defined according Blade\u2019s criteria, plus nCR defined as IF positive or >90%\u2193 in PP and VGPR defined as >75% \u2193reduction in PP. 231 pts are evaluable per protocol. Best response to TD: CR (14%) nCR 17%, VGPR 17%, PR 21%, yielding an ORR (CR-PR) of 68%. Best response to MP: CR 7%, nCR 8%, VGPR 14%, PR 22%; ORR 51% (ORR in TD vs. MP p=.0044). Time to response and time to best response were shorter in the TD (6, 16 weeks, respectively) compared to the MP group (16, 25 weeks, respectively; p72 yrs treated with MP (median: 46.5.9 vs. 25.4, p72 years but not in those aged \u226472 who showed similar OS with TD and MP. Pts on TD had more neuropathy, DVT, psychological toxicity, and a higher rate of early treatment discontinuations, while haematological toxicity was higher in pts treated with MP.",
