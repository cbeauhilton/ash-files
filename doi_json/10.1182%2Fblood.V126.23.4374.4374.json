    "abstract_text": "Background With the advent of imatinib and the other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting BCR-ABL1, the outcomes of Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) improved substantially. Nonetheless, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) in first complete remission (CR1) remains the consolidation therapy of choice in Ph+ ALL. Evidence is emerging that post-transplant relapse is influenced by the persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD), with an inferior outcome of patients undergoing transplantation with measurable level of MRD (Sramkova L et al, Pediatr Blood Cancer 2007; Bar M et al. Leuk Res Treatment 2014). Considering that a deeper molecular response can probably be achieved with innovative targeted therapies, such as second and third-generation TKIs or immunotherapy, an accurate evaluation of MRD values before alloSCT may be very relevant. Aim of the study . To evaluate the predictive relevance of MRD levels before transplant in Ph+ALL patients in CR1 on the probabilities of (i) overall survival (OS), (ii) relapse incidence (CIR) and (iii) leukemia free survival (LFS) Patients and methods . One hundred and six adult patients (median age 41.2, range 19-62) with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL (as determined by cytogenetic or molecular analysis) were enrolled into 2 prospective NILG protocols (09/00 ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier: NCT00358072 and 10/07 ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier: NCT00358072) and were treated with chemotherapy and imatinib. One hundred (94%) achieved CR1, of whom 72 patients underwent an alloSCT in CR1 and are the subject of this report. MRD was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) according to validated methods. Results. Among the 72 patients undergoing alloSCT, MRD status before transplant was available for 65 patients (90%). Twenty-four patients (37%) achieved a complete molecular response (BCR-ABL/ABL<1x10 -5 ) at time of conditioning (MRD- group), while 41 (63%) remained carriers of any positive MRD level in the bone marrow or peripheral blood (MRD+ group), ranging from 1.2x10 -4 to 2x10 -1 . Patients' characteristics were similar between MRD+ and MRD- groups, except for a higher hemoglobin levels and a predominance of male gender in MRD- group, as summarized in Table 1. Thirty-five patients received alloSCT from a sibling and 37 from unrelated donor. The conditioning regimen to alloSCT was myeloablative in 85% and reduced intensity in 15% of patients. The stem cell source was the bone marrow in 19%, the peripheral blood in 78% and cord blood in the remaining 3% of patients. For the whole patient cohort (n=106), the median follow-up was 2.8 years (range 0.06-11.8), with a 5 years OS of 41%. The OS of patients receiving alloSCT was 50%. The MRD negativity at time of conditioning was associated with a significant benefit in terms of risk of relapse with a CIR of 8% compared to 39% of patients with MRD positivity (p=0.007) (Figure 1A). Nonetheless, the LFS and OS probability were not significant different in MRD- compared to MRD+ patients (58% vs 41%, p=0.17 and 58% vs 49%, p=0.55, respectively) (Figure1B), likely due to the effective post-relapse treatment with TKIs and/or DLI. The cumulative incidence of non relapse mortality was similar in MRD- compared to that of MRD+ group (33% vs 20%, p=0.22). Conclusions . Our results confirm that patients undergoing alloSCT with measurable levels of MRD show a significant increase risk of relapse after transplant. These results highlight the importance of achieving a complete molecular remission before transplant that should be considered an essential prerequisite for successful alloSCT. Table 1.
