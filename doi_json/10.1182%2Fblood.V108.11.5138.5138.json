    "abstract_text": "Transplantation of HLA-mismatched nucleated cells from cord blood (CB) has reduced risks of graft rejection and severe acute graft-versus-host disease. In this study we analyzed the in-vitro alloantigen presenting capacity of cord blood nucleated cells. CB mononuclear cells (MNCs) or immunomagnetically-selected CD34+ cells, or CD14+ monocytes, were irradiated and tested as stimulators of allogeneic blood T cells in primary (stimulator:responder ratio = 1:1) or secondary (stimulator:responder ratio = 1:2) mixed leukocyte culture (MLC), or in cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) assays. CB-MNCs failed to induce allogeneic T cell proliferation in 6-days primary MLC, whereas CD34+ or CD14+ cells stimulated brisk T cell responses. A suppressive effect of CB-MNCs was ruled out since CD3+ cell-depletion of CB-MNCs did not restore CB immunogenicity and the addition of increasing doses of CB-MNCs did not inhibit T cell alloreactivity to CD34+ cells. Despite allogeneic T cells were unresponsive to CB-MNCs after primary and secondary MLC, T cell anergy was ruled out since T cells that were unresponsive after primary MLC proliferated potently in secondary MLC stimulated with CB CD34+ cells, and even more with CB monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DC) generated in-vitro with GM-CSF and IL-4. Interestingly, after co-culture with irradiated allogeneic T cells for 6 days, CB-MNCs showed a greater proportion of CD86+ cells and elicited allo- T cell proliferation. In addition, allo-CTL activity was induced by CB-MNCs only after restimulating effector cells for 3\u20134 weeks (26\u00b17% lysis of antigen-specific PHA-blast at 50:1 E:T ratio), and was comparable to CTL activity induced after 1 week by Mo-DC generated from the same CB. When T cell effectors were stimulated by combining two incompatible cord blood MNCs mixed together, CTL activity was then detected after 4 weeks against both of them regardless of the CB:CB cell ratio. These results show an impaired allo-APC activity of CB-MNCs, without suppressive or tolerogenic activity. These findings might partially explain the initial engraftment of combined HLA mismatched CB grafts in vivo, however they also suggest that a delayed T cell response may occur due to CB-derived APCs activating CTLs.",
