    "abstract_text": "Starch-conjugated deferoxamine (S-DFO) is a long-acting, polymeric iron chelator designed to achieve iron balance in patients requiring frequent transfusions. Results from an ascending single dose study in 16 patients with beta-thalassemia showed that S-DFO is capable of achieving up to 7 days of iron balance ( Br. J. Haematol . 138 , 374 \u2013381, 2007 ). The multiple dose toxicology study described here was conducted to support extended clinical studies in patients with thalassemia and other iron overload disorders. The study was designed to evaluate physiological effects of S-DFO in iron-loaded animals; to seek evidence of cardiovascular side-effects; to find evidence of drug accumulation in plasma and other tissues; and to determine the No Observable Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) following biweekly intravenous infusion for 4 weeks. Iron loading was achieved by multiple biweekly infusions of iron-dextran so as to give a cumulative dose of 500 mg of iron/kg body weight. Equilibration of iron was then allowed to proceed for 10 weeks before initiation of treatment. The study included four groups of 10 iron-loaded animals (5M/5F): saline controls; 210 and 420 mg/kg of deferoxamine (DFO) equivalents as S-DFO; 105 mg/kg of non-conjugated DFO; and two groups of 10 normoferremic animals (5M/5F): saline controls; and 210 mg/kg of DFO equivalents as S-DFO. All animals received 8 doses of either S-DFO, DFO or saline over 28 days. Six animals in each group (3M/3F) were euthanized on Day 29 for histological examination, the remaining 4 animals in each group on Day 43. Safety parameters for cardiovascular pharmacology, hematology and clinical chemistry showed no changes attributable to S-DFO treatment. The polymeric chelator is cleaved/metabolized by serum amylase(s). While trough concentrations of S-DFO fragments prior to the final drug infusion on Day 25 showed some accumulation, there was no evidence of resulting pathological changes. Thus, the NOAEL is at least 420 mg/kg of DFO equivalents. The hepatic iron content of the iron-loaded animals was approximately 20 times greater than that of the normoferremic controls. Treatment with 420 mg/kg of DFO equivalents led to a 13% reduction in the liver iron content. Neither iron loading nor treatment with S-DFO had a significant effect upon the cardiac iron status. The lack of toxicity in normoferremic animals suggests that S-DFO may have applications in clinical situations where increased iron stores are not characteristic of the disease. Furthermore, the ability to safely infuse up to 420 mg/kg of DFO equivalents without concern for hypotension indicates that S-DFO may also be well suited for treatment of acute iron poisoning. Finally, these results support initiation of multidose studies of S-DFO in patients with thalassemia and other iron overload disorders. Supported by NIDDK Contract Number N01-DK-32624."
