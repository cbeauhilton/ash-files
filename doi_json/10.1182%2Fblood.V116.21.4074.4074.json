    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4074 Aberrant protein folding results in the accumulation of misfolded/unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which in turn triggers ER stress followed by unfolded protein response (UPR), an adaptive response against ER stress. Since multiple myeloma (MM) cells have high protein synthesis, they are sensitive to ER stress and require strict ER quality control for cell survival. Upon UPR, IRE1\u03b1 is activated by auto-phosphorylation resulting in activation of its endoribonuclease domain to splice XBP1 mRNA from XBP1 unspliced form (XBP1u: inactive) to XBP1 spliced form (XBP1s: active). Since XBP1 is a transcription factor regulating genes which are responsible for protein folding and ER associated degradation (ERAD), IRE1\u03b1-XBP1 pathway acts as a pro-survival signaling pathway under the UPR condition. In this study, we examined whether IRE1\u03b1-XBP1 pathway is a potential novel therapeutic option in MM. We first examined IRE1\u03b1 expression and confirmed its expression in all MM cell lines. In contrast, XBP1s was not detected by RT-PCR in most cell lines except in for RPMI8226 cells. To assess biologic significance of IRE1\u03b1 in MM cell, we knock-downed its expression using shRNA and found that downregulation of IRE1\u03b1 inhibited MM cell growth, indicating that IRE1\u03b1 has a crucial role in MM cell survival. We next examined the impact of inhibition of XBP1 splicing by a small molecule IRE1\u03b1 endoribonuclease inhibitor MKC-3946 (Mannkind, Valencia CA) in MM cells in vitro. As expected, MKC-3946 significantly inhibited tunicamycin-induced XBP1s without affecting phosphorylation of IRE1\u03b1. MKC-3946 induced only modest cytotoxicity in MM cell lines without toxicity in normal mononuclear cells from healthy donors; however, it significantly enhanced cytotoxicity in combination with bortezomib or 17-AAG. Both bortezomib and 17-AAG induced ER stress evidenced by induction of XBP1s; conversely, MKC-3946 blocked XBP1s triggered by these agents. Furthermore, apoptosis induced by these agents was enhanced with MKC-3946 associated with increased CHOP, which is a known pro-apoptotic protein induced in uncompensated ER stress condition. Importantly, MKC-3946 enhanced the cytotoxicity of bortezomib or 17-AAG in INA6 cells, even in the presence of increased IL-6 or bone marrow stromal cells. Finally, MKC-3946 was active inhibiting XBP1 splicing in a model of ER stress and significantly inhibited growth of RPMI8226 plasmacytoma in a xenograft murine model when used in combination with a low dose of bortezomib. Taken together, our results demonstrate that inhibition of XBP1 splicing by blockade of IRE1\u03b1 is a promising therapeutic option in MM.
