    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Copanlisib, a pan-class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, is approved in the US for the treatment of patients (pts) with relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received \u22652 prior systemic therapies; it also has Breakthrough Therapy designation for pts with relapsed marginal zone lymphoma who have received \u22652 prior therapies. The Phase II CHRONOS-1 study in pts with indolent lymphoma treated with copanlisib (NCT01660451; Part B) demonstrated an objective response rate of 59.2% with manageable safety and low rates of severe adverse events (AEs) (Dreyling M et al. J Clin Oncol 2017). We report pooled safety data from 8 Phase I and II studies of pts with hematologic malignancies following long-term treatment with copanlisib. Methods: Pts with hematologic malignancies treated with copanlisib monotherapy in completed open-label Phase I or II studies were included. Copanlisib 60 mg (i.v.) was administered intermittently on days (d) 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-d cycle until disease progression (PD) or unacceptable toxicity. AEs were reported using MedDRA (v.21.1) and assessed by time of onset (worst grade or new AEs occurring \u2264180 d, 181-360 d, or \u2265361 d) and treatment duration. Results: A total of 364 pts received copanlisib (data cut-off Feb 2019). Median age was 65 years (range 22-93); the predominant histology was FL (42.0%). At data cut-off, 34 pts (9.3%) remained on treatment. Duration of treatment ranged from 0.2 to 62.1 months, with 56 pts (15.4%) treated for >1 year. All-grade treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were reported in 97.8% of pts; 51.4% had TEAEs of worst grade [g] 3, and 24.7% had TEAEs of worst g4. The most common (\u226520%) TEAEs (all grade / g3 / g4) were hyperglycemia (50.5% / 28.3% / 4.4%), hypertension (38.7% / 29.1% / 0%), diarrhea (37.1% / 4.9% / 0%), nausea (28.3% / 1.4% / 0%), fatigue (27.2% / 2.7% / 0%), pyrexia (23.1% / 3.0% / 0%), and neutropenia (23.1% / 9.3% / 9.6%). Hyperglycemia and hypertension were infusion related, transient, and manageable. Events generally were reported early, with higher incidence at \u2264180 d ( n =364) vs 181-360 d ( n =118) or \u2265361 d ( n =56), and no increased incidence of g\u22653 events with prolonged exposure, with the exception of diarrhea (all grade [g\u22653]): hyperglycemia (49.2% [31.6%] / 21.2% [11.0%] / 19.6% [10.7%]), hypertension (37.4% [27.2%] / 21.2% [15.3%] / 21.4% [17.9%]), diarrhea (32.7% [3.0%] / 20.3% [4.2%] / 30.4% [12.5%]), nausea (27.5% [1.4%] / 0.8% [0%] / 3.6% [0%]), fatigue (24.2% [2.5%] / 5.9% [0.8%] / 10.7% [1.8%]), pyrexia (19.2% [2.7%] / 16.1% [0.8%] / 10.7% [0%]), and neutropenia (19.5% [16.2%] / 13.6% [8.5%] / 21.4% [16.1%]). A similar trend was observed in pts treated for >1 year (Table), though these pts had a broad range of exposures, with 22 pts treated for \u22652 years. Incidences of g\u22653 diarrhea in pts treated for >1 year remained stable and were comparable with prolonged exposure (\u2264180 d 8.9%; 181-360 d 7.1%; \u2265361 d 12.5%). Pneumonitis was infrequent overall (all grade / g\u22653: 5.2% / 2.7%) and in pts treated for >1 year (10.7% / 3.6%). Copanlisib-related TEAEs of all grades / g3 / g4 were reported for 88.7% / 54.1% / 18.4% of pts; most events were reported early (\u2264180 d) with generally no increase in incidence or severity observed in pts treated for >1 year. Serious AEs (SAEs) occurred in 57.1% of pts, most commonly (\u22652%; all grade / g\u22653) pneumonia (6.0% / 5.5%), general physical health deterioration (5.2% / 4.9%), pyrexia (4.1% / 1.4%), hyperglycemia (4.1% / 4.1%), pneumonitis (4.1% / 2.7%), lung infection (3.0% / 2.2%), and febrile neutropenia (2.2% / 2.2%). All-grade / g3 / g4 copanlisib-related SAEs were reported for 30.2% / 18.7% / 5.8% of pts. As with TEAEs, SAEs mostly occurred early with no general increase in incidence or severity with treatment >1 year. Thirty-nine pts died either during copanlisib treatment or within 35 d post discontinuation of treatment (10.7%), most commonly due to PD (4.7%). No g4 late-onset colitis, hepatotoxicity, or other intestinal toxicity occurred after 6 months of treatment. Conclusions: These data provide evidence for the manageable safety profile of long-term copanlisib treatment, with no late-onset toxicities or worsening of severity of TEAEs, and few severe gastrointestinal TEAEs. Transient, manageable hyperglycemia and hypertension were among the most common TEAEs; no new unexpected safety issues were identified. These results support the known safety profile and approved indication of copanlisib.
