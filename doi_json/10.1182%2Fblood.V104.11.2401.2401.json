    "abstract_text": "Atiprimod (N-N-diethl-8,8-dipropyl-2-azaspiro [4.5] decane-2-propanamine) is an orally-bioavailable cationic amphiphilic compound which significantly inhibits inflammation in rat arthritis and multiple sclerosis models. It acts, at least in part, by significantly inhibiting production of interleukin (IL)-6. Since IL-6 mediates MM cell growth, survival and drug resistance in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, we in this study characterized the effect of Atiprimod on human MM cells. We first demonstrated that Atiprimod significantly inhibited growth ( p <0.05) in MM.1S, U266, and RPMI8226 MM cell lines in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, with IC50s of 0.5\u20131.25 mM. It also induced cytotoxicity in dexamethasone (Dex)-, doxorubicin (Dox)-, and melphalan (Mel)-resistant MM cell lines; as well as in patient MM cells, but not in normal PBMCs. Atiprimod triggered MM cell apoptosis via activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3, followed by PARP cleavage. Importantly, neither IL-6 nor insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, which completely abrogate Dex-induced apoptosis, protects against Atiprimod-induced apoptosis in MM.1S cells. In combination treatment studies, both conventional (Dex, Dox, Mel) and novel (As 2 O 3 ) agents augment MM cell apoptosis induced by Atiprimod. Atiprimod inhibits STAT3 and Akt, but not ERK1/2, phosphorylation triggered by IL-6, BAX, Bcl-xl, and Mcl-1 in MM.1S cells. Importantly Atiprimod inhibits both IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion in BM stromal cells (BMSCs) triggered by MM cell adherence to BMSCs, as well as associated MM cell growth. Finally, Atiprimod inhibits tumor OPM1 MM cell growth in vivo and prolongs survival in a SCID mouse model. Our data therefore demonstrate that Atiprimod both induces MM cell apoptosis and inhibits cytokine secretion in the BM milieu, providing the framework for ongoing clinical trials of this agent to improve patient outcome in MM."
