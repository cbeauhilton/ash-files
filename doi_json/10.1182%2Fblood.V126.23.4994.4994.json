    "abstract_text": "Purpose: Next-generation sequencing methods recently have been applied for leukemia patients to discover genetic variants. In this study, we conducted whole-exome sequencing (WES) in Korean acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) children to identify putative genetic drivers of leukemia. Methods: Four Korean ALL children were included for WES. For two of them, we also conducted WES after remission, considered as germline control. The characteristics of subjects and the diagnostic information are described in Table 1. Genomic DNA was extracted from the subject\u00a1\u00afs bone marrow aspirates at diagnosis of leukemia and/or after remission. Whole-exome was captured by SureSelect Human All Exon V4 (Agilent Technologies, California, USA). Sequencing was performed using HiSeq2000 (Illumina, California, USA). Variants in dbSNP135 and TIARA database were excluded. Variants with minor allele frequencies > 0.5% of 1000g were filtered out. Functional variants (gain of stop codon, frameshifts and nonsynonymous SNVs) were selected as pathogenic mutations and were scanned for the 571 cancer gene set using \u00a1\u00b0Cancer gene Census\u00a1\u00b1 in COSMIC website. The finally selected variants were verified by PROVEAN, SIFT and PolyPhen-2. This research was approved by The Institutional Review Board in Keimyung University Dongsan Medical Center (Approval No., 2015-05-029-002). Results: After comparison between WES at diagnosis and WES after remission, p.W112C in PAX5 in patient 1 andp.G315C in KMT2C, p.T311P in NOTCH1, p.G11A in HOXD13 in patient 2 were considered as pathogenic, respectively. In patient 3 and 4, p.R293C in FNBP1, p.R254H in PCSK7, p.E11Q in TP53, p.R806Q in MYO5A, p.R108G in PPFIBP1, p.C1785R in RNF213 , and p.A963P in WRN were suspected as putative drivers of leukemia. The respective variants are shown in Table 2. Conclusions: This is the first attempt of WES in Korean children with leukemia. WES is a valuable method to identify genomics of childhood ALL. Table 1.
