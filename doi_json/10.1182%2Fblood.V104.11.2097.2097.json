    "abstract_text": "The impetus for kinase inhibition as a therapeutic endpoint in leukemia research has been driven largely by the success of imatinib mesylate in chronic myelogenous leukemia. However, while imatinib mesylate has been extremely effective in the treatment of chronic phase CML, resistant disease often emerges in both Philadelphia positive ALL and aggressive phase CML patients. Adaphostin is a tyrphostin inhibitor originally developed to target the bcr/abl kinase and demonstrates selectivity in CML patient isolates. Here we show that in vitro, adaphostin is cytotoxic in numerous models that are resistant to imatinib. Features of adaphostin action in bcr/abl containing cells include apoptosis induction via an oxidant dependent mechanism and degradation of bcr/abl protein. Cell lines containing point mutations in p210 bcr/abl which confer imatinib resistance exhibit intracellular peroxide production and DNA fragmentation in response to adaphostin. Bcr/abl degradation also occurs but can be dissociated from peroxide production and subsequent apoptosis signaling. Similar data has also been obtained in cell lines containing p190 bcr/abl. Studies extending these observations into mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells from imatinib resistant CML patients and Ph+ ALL patients confirm the same mechanism in primary clinical isolates. Collectively, these data suggest that reactive oxygen species generation by adaphostin bypasses imatinib resistance in CML and Ph+ ALL. Further studies dissecting the mechanism of ROS generation by adaphostin in imatinib resistant cells may lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets.",
