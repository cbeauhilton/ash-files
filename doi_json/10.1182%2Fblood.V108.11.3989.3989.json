    "abstract_text": "Previous studies have shown that severe ADAMTS13 deficiency in TMA is associated with lower platelet counts, a greater number of plasma exchange procedures, and a higher rate of relapse compared to non-severely-deficient ADAMTS13. To further explore prognostic factors in TMA, we retrospectively analyzed associations between several pre-TPE laboratory analytes and the number of TPE procedures in a large cohort of surviving TMA patients. We evaluated TMA patients with severely deficient (2-fold more TPE procedures (median 6.5 TPE) than CRP>1.0 ng/dL (median 15 TPE) (p=0.0026). By contrast, there was no relationship between platelet count, Hct or CRP level and the number of TPE in ADAMTS13-N patients. However, evidence of sepsis (elevation of both PCT and CRP) was present in 40% of ADAMTS13-N patients, but was not associated with number of TPE procedures. No ADAMTS13-D patient had elevated PCT. In conclusion, lower pre-TPE platelet counts, higher Hcts and higher CRP levels were associated with significantly greater numbers of TPE in ADAMTS13-D TMA. By contrast, no laboratory parameter was associated with number of TPE in ADAMTS13-N patients. ADAMTS13 levels combined with other laboratory parameters may therefore be helpful in the prognosis, resource management, and guidance of adjunctive therapy in TMA. In addition, rapid assays such as PCT may allow early identification of sepsis in TMA patients, which may not have prognostic significance, but could prompt antibiotic treatment that may enhance outcome. The distinct difference in prognostic factors between ADAMT13-D and ADAMTS13-N patient subsets further supports the pathogenic importance of ADAMTS13 in TMA."
