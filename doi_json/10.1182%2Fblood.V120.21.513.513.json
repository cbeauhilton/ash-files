    "abstract_text": "Abstract 513 Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital erythroid hypoplasia associated with physical abnormalities and predisposition to cancer. Mutations in genes that encode ribosomal proteins have been identified in approximately 60\u201370 % of the patients. Among these genes, ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) is the most common DBA gene (25 % of the cases). Current DBA therapies involve risks for serious side effects and a high proportion of deaths are treatment-related underscoring the need for novel therapies. We have previously demonstrated that enforced expression of RPS19 improves the proliferation, erythroid colony-forming potential and differentiation of patient derived RPS19-deficient hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro (Hamaguchi, Blood 2002; Hamaguchi, Mol Ther 2003). Furthermore, RPS19 overexpression enhances the engraftment and erythroid differentiation of patient-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells when transplanted into immunocompromised mice (Flygare, Exp Hematol 2008). Collectively these studies suggest the feasibility of gene therapy in the treatment of RPS19-deficient DBA. In the current project we have assessed the therapeutic efficacy of gene therapy using a mouse model for RPS19-deficient DBA (Jaako, Blood 2011; Jaako, Blood 2012). This model contains an Rps19-targeting shRNA (shRNA-D) that is expressed by a doxycycline-responsive promoter located downstream of Collagen A1 gene. Transgenic animals were bred either heterozygous or homozygous for the shRNA-D in order to generate two models with intermediate or severe Rps19 deficiency, respectively. Indeed, following transplantation, the administration of doxycycline to the recipients with homozygous shRNA-D bone marrow results in an acute and lethal bone marrow failure, while the heterozygous shRNA-D recipients develop a mild and chronic phenotype. We employed lentiviral vectors harboring a codon-optimized human RPS19 cDNA driven by the SFFV promoter, followed by IRES and GFP (SFFV-RPS19). A similar vector without the RPS19 cDNA was used as a control (SFFV-GFP). To assess the therapeutic potential of the SFFV-RPS19 vector in vivo, transduced c-Kit enriched bone marrow cells from control and homozygous shRNA-D mice were injected into lethally irradiated wild-type mice. Based on the percentage of GFP-positive cells, transduction efficiencies varied between 40 % and 60 %. Three months after transplantation, recipient mice were administered doxycycline in order to induce Rps19 deficiency. After two weeks of doxycycline administration, the recipients transplanted with SFFV-RPS19 or SFFV-GFP control cells showed no differences in blood cellularity. Remarkably, at the same time-point the recipients with SFFV-GFP homozygous shRNA-D bone marrow showed a dramatic decrease in blood cellularity that led to death, while the recipients with SFFV-RPS19 shRNA-D bone marrow showed nearly normal blood cellularity. These results demonstrate the potential of enforced expression of RPS19 to reverse the severe anemia and bone marrow failure in DBA. To assess the reconstitution advantage of transduced hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with time, we performed similar experiments with heterozygous shRNA-D bone marrow cells. We monitored the percentage of GFP-positive myeloid cells in the peripheral blood, which provides a dynamic read-out for bone marrow activity. After four months of doxycycline administration, the mean percentage of GFP-positive cells in the recipients with SFFV-RPS19 heterozygous shRNA-D bone marrow increased to 97 %, while no similar advantage was observed in the recipients with SFFV-RPS19 or SFFV-GFP control bone marrow, or SFFV-GFP heterozygous shRNA-D bone marrow. Consistently, SFFV-RPS19 conferred a reconstitution advantage over the non-transduced cells in the bone marrow. Furthermore, SFFV-RPS19 reversed the hypocellular bone marrow observed in the SFFV-GFP heterozygous shRNA-D recipients. Taken together, using mouse models for RPS19-deficient DBA, we demonstrate that the enforced expression of RPS19 rescues the lethal bone marrow failure and confers a strong reconstitution advantage in vivo. These results provide a proof-of-principle for gene therapy in the treatment of RPS19-deficient DBA. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
