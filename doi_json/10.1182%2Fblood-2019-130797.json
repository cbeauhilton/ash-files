    "abstract_text": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an incurable B cell malignancy, defined by the t(11;14) translocation and comprises 3-6% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas diagnosed annually. MCL is associated with a poor prognosis due to emergence of resistance to immuno-chemotherapy and targeted agents. Due to the late median age of diagnosis, aggressive chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation are often not realistic options. The average overall survival of patients with MCL is 5 years and for the majority of patients who progress on targeted agents like ibrutinib, survival remains at a dismal 3-8 months. There is a major unmet need to identify new therapeutic approaches that are well tolerated by elderly patients to improve treatment outcomes and quality of life. Our group has identified the type II protein arginine methyltransferase enzyme, PRMT5, to be dysregulated in MCL and to promote growth and survival by supporting the cell cycle, PRC2 activity, and signaling via the BCR and PI3K/AKT pathways. We have developed first-in-class selective inhibitors of PRMT5 and, in collaboration with Prelude Therapeutics, we have demonstrated that novel SAM-competitive PRMT5 inhibitors provide potent anti-tumor activity in aggressive preclinical models of human MCL. Selective inhibition of PRMT5 in these models and MCL cell lines leads to disruption of constitutive PI3K/AKT signaling, dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of FOXO1, and enhanced recruitment of this tumor suppressor protein to chromatin. We identified 136 newly emerged FOXO1-bound genomic loci following 48 hours of PRMT5 inhibition in the CCMCL1 MCL line by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq analysis. These genes were markedly upregulated in CCMCL1 cells treated with the PRMT5 inhibitor PRT382 as determined by RNA-seq analysis. Among those genes, we identified and confirmed FOXO1 recruitment to the promoter of BAX , a pro-apoptotic member of the BCL2 family of proteins. Treatment of MCL cell lines (Granta-519, CCMCL1, Z-138, and SEFA) with the selective PRMT5 inhibitor PRT382 (10, 100nM) led to upregulation of BAX protein levels and induction of programmed cell death as measured by annexin V/PI staining and flow cytometry. We hypothesized that induction of BAX would trigger a therapeutic vulnerability to the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax, and that combination PRMT5/BCL2 inhibitor therapy would drive synergistic cell death in MCL. Single agent and combination treatment with venetoclax and PRT382 was performed in eight MCL lines including a new cell line generated from our ibrutinib-refractory PDX model (SEFA) and IC50 and synergy scores were calculated. The Z-138 line was most sensitive to venetoclax (IC501uM). All lines reached an IC50  20) in 4 lines and moderate synergy (scores 10-20) in 2 lines. The two lines with the highest levels of synergy, Z-138 and SEFA, express high levels of BCL-2 and are Ibrutinib resistant. Overall there was a strong positive correlation between BCL2 expression and synergy score (r=0.707), and no correlation between PRMT5 expression and synergy score (r=0.084). In vivo evaluation in two preclinical MCL models (Granta-519 NSG mouse flank and an ibrutinib-resistant MCL PDX) showed therapeutic synergy with combination venetoclax/PRT382 treatment. In both models, mice were treated with sub-therapeutic doses of venetoclax and/or PRT543 (Granta) or PRT382 (IR-MCL PDX) and tumor burden assessed weekly via flank mass measurement (Granta) or flow cytometry (IR-MCL-PDX). Combination treatment with well-tolerated doses of venetoclax and PRMT5 inhibitors in both MCL in vivo models showed synergistic anti-tumor activity without evidence of toxicity. This preclinical data provides mechanistic rationale while demonstrating therapeutic synergy and lack of toxicity in this preclinical study and justifies further consideration of this combination strategy targeting PRMT5 and BCL2 in MCL in the clinical setting. PRT543, a selective PRMT5 inhibitor, has been advanced into clinical studies for the treatment of patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, including MCL (NCT03886831).
