    "abstract_text": "Introduction Data on the economic burden of disease progression among multiple myeloma (MM) patients who have had a stem cell transplant (SCT) in the US are limited. This study evaluated the impact of disease progression on healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and costs among these patients in the US. Methods Adult patients (pts) with a confirmed MM diagnosis (Dx), defined as \u22651 inpatient or \u22652 non-diagnostic outpatient claims 30-365 days apart who initiated a course of MM therapy (Rx) during the study period (Jan 1, 2006 to Dec 31, 2016) and received SCT during the first year after the initial diagnosis of MM were identified from the Truven Analytics MedStat MarketScan\u00ae Commercial Claims and Encounters and Medicare and Coordination of Benefits databases. The first date with Dx for MM was defined as the \"Dx date\" and line of therapy (LOT) was identified based on an adaptation of a previously-developed algorithm. Pts were excluded if they had a gap in enrollment during the period beginning 6-month before the Dx date through 30-days after the first LOT (1L) initiation date, received MM Rx, unclassified antineoplastic medications, or SCT before the Dx date, or had missing information required to identify LOT or assess baseline characteristics or study outcomes. The 12 months after initiation of each LOT was designated the \"event identification period\" for progression. Disease progression was defined as advancement to next LOT, diagnosis or procedure codes indicative of bone metastasis, hypercalcemia, soft tissue plasmacytoma, skeletal related events, or acute kidney disease while off MM Rx, or death. The \"event date\" for progression was defined as date with evidence of progression. For each pt with progression, one pt without progression was randomly selected and assigned an event date to ensure that the distribution of time from LOT initiation to event date for pts without progression was the same as the distribution of time from LOT initiation to event date for pts with progression. For each LOT (L1-L3), annual HCRU and costs from index date, defined as 30-day before the event date, through disenrollment or end of the study period were compared for pts with vs without progression using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to adjust for differences between groups in baseline characteristics including year of index date, age, gender, region, plan type, Medicare status, comorbidities, and pre-index HRU and healthcare costs. All costs were adjusted to 2016 US $. In a subgroup analysis, HCRU and costs were evaluated for LOTs initiated from 2013 to 2016 to reflect patterns of treatment in current era. Results Of the 28,184 adult MM pts who received \u22651 MM Rx during the study period, 3226 qualified for the study, including 837 pts with progression and 2389 without progression during 1L. The corresponding numbers for 2L, and 3L were 412 and 589, and 226 and 196, respectively. Mean age at index date was 57 years; 57% were male. After IPTW, all baseline characteristics were well balanced in all LOTs with standardized mean differences <0.1 for most baseline characteristics. The mean number of hospitalizations per year was greater for pts with progression in all LOTs, with differences ranging from 1.11 (95%CI 0.85, 1.37) for 2L to 0.34 (95%CI 0.21, 0.47) for 1L. In all LOTs, annual costs of inpatient and outpatient services were greater for pts with progression while costs of outpatient prescriptions were greater among patient without progression. Total healthcare costs were greater for pts with vs without progression in all LOTs with hospitalizations and outpatient visit costs being key drivers. Total incremental annual costs in those who progressed were higher by $13,386 (1L), $105,004 (2L), and $70,206 (3L). When the analysis was restricted to LOTs initiated between 2013 and 2016, the incremental costs in pts who progressed were generally greater in the most recent era: $43,381 (1L), $113,797 (2L), and $115,327 (3L). Conclusions For MM pts receiving drug Rx and SCT the economic burden of disease progression is substantial across all LOTs. Incremental costs of progression are largely attributable to hospitalizations and outpatient visits. Treatments that prevent or delay progression are likely to yield important reductions in downstream disease management costs. These savings should be considered in frameworks assessing the value of innovative treatments for MM.
