    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) represent a heterogeneous group of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas, with suboptimal outcomes with conventional chemotherapy. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHCT) is a therapeutic strategy for patients in first remission. However, progression-free survival (PFS) after AHCT is only 36-45% (d'Amore et al JCO 2012, Reimer et al JCO 2009), signifying an unmet therapeutic need for improving outcomes post-transplant. Maintenance therapy after AHCT may improve PFS. Romidepsin is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that is FDA approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory T-cell lymphoma, and is a potential option for maintenance therapy. We present the results of the first multicenter study to evaluate the PFS of patients receiving maintenance therapy after upfront AHCT in PTCL patients. Methods: This was a phase 2, open-label, multicenter, investigator-initiated study in adult patients with PTCL (Table 1). 25 patients transplanted in first complete response or first partial response (CR1 or PR1) (Cohort 1) were evaluable for the primary endpoint of 2-year PFS. We enrolled another cohort (n=8) with high-risk histologies in CR/PR1 (n= 1), or transplanted in CR/PR2 or later (n=7) (Cohort 2). Patients underwent AHCT with carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan (BEAM) conditioning. Maintenance romidepsin 14 mg/m2 was initiated between days 42-80 post AHCT, and administered every other week through 6 months, every 3 weeks through 1 year and every 4 weeks from 1 year through 2 years post AHCT. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate PFS. Desired 2-year PFS was 70%. Results: Table 1 lists patient and disease characteristics. In Cohort 1, median follow up was 13.8 months (3.5 - 54.1 mon). Estimated 2-year PFS was 49% (30 - 80, 95% CI) (Figure 1). Median PFS was 20.0 months (12.0- NA, 95% CI). In Cohort 2, median follow up was 23.2 months (range, 9.1 - 35.7 months). Median PFS was 13.9 months (5.6 - NA, 95% CI). Estimated 2-year PFS was 47% (21 - 100, 95% CI). Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) patients represented the largest subgroup within the study. 2-year PFS of these patients in Cohort 1 was 44% (20-96, 95% CI). In Cohort 1, 16 patients are off therapy (9 for disease progression, 2 for toxicity, 2 for patient choice and 3 completed therapy). Across cohorts, 5 patients required dose reduction. 6 patients experienced \u2265 grade 3 toxicity (neutropenia=4, anemia=2, thrombocytopenia=2 and lymphopenia=2). 8 serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 6 patients after romidepsin treatment (epistaxis, fever, febrile neutropenia, hypotension, fatigue, myalgia, generalized muscle weakness, dyspnea, and CMV retinitis). Grade 2 toxicities included dysgeusia (5), neutropenia (3), anorexia (2), atrial fibrillation (1), hematuria (1), nausea (1), and fatigue (1). Grade 1 toxicities included dysgeusia (7), fatigue (4), nausea (4), anorexia (2), constipation (2), diarrhea (1), neutropenia (1), thrombocytopenia (1), and vomiting (1). Conclusions: Maintenance romidepsin was overall well-tolerated without significant additional grade 3-4 toxicity. At first assessment, the estimated median 2-year PFS in Cohort 1 of 49% does not indicate PFS improvement with romidepsin maintenance. Enrollment is complete and 9 patients in Cohort 1 are still on treatment. Final PFS will be updated.
