    "abstract_text": "Background: The current study attempted to evaluate the role of a simple quantitative measurement of peripheral lymphocyte subsets, especially CD4 + helper T-cell recovery, in predicting transplant outcomes, including overall survival (OS), non-relapse mortality (NRM), and opportunistic infections, after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Methods: A total of 69 patients receiving an allogeneic SCT were included. The disease entities were as follows: AML 42, ALL 5, CML 15, NHL 5, and high-risk MDS 2. The peripheral lymphocyte subset counts, such as CD3 + T-cells, CD3 + 4 + helper T-cells, CD3 + 8 + cytotoxic T-cells, CD19 + B-cells, and CD56 + natural killer (NK) cells, were measured 3, 6, and 12 months post-transplant. Results: The CD19 + B-cell reconstitution was slow, while a rapid CD56 + NK cell recovery was noted. The CD4 + helper T-cell reconstitution at 3 months was strongly correlated with OS (p<0.0001), NRM (p=0.0007), and opportunistic infections (p=0.0108) when stratifying patients with cut-off value of 200\u00d710 6 /L CD4 + helper T-cells. A rapid CD4 + helper T-cell recovery was also independently associated with a higher CD4 + helper T-cell transplant dose (p=0.006) and donor type (p<0.001) in a regression analysis. An early CD4 + helper T-cell recovery at 3 months was associated with a subsequent faster helper T-cell recovery until 12 months, yet not with B-cell recovery. In a multivariate survival analysis, a combination of a higher CD34 + cell dose and rapid recovery of CD4 + helper T-cells at 3 months was found to a have favorable prognosis in terms of OS (p=0.001, hazard ratio [HR] 3.653) and NRM (p=0.005, HR 4.836), yet not relapse. Conclusion: A rapid recovery of the CD4 + helper T-cell count above 200\u00d710 6 /L at 3 months seemed to correlate with a faster immune reconstitution and predict a successful transplant outcome.
