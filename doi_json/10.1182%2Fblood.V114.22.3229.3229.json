    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3229 Poster Board III-166 Introduction Low platelet count prior to mobilization is a significant predictive factor for mobilization failure in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin's disease (HD) undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation (auto-HSCT; Hosing C, et al, Am J Hematol . 2009). The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of HSC mobilization with plerixafor plus G-CSF in patients with concomitant thrombocytopenia undergoing auto-HSCT. Methods Patients who had failed successful HSC collection with any mobilization regimen were remobilized with plerixafor plus G-CSF as part of a compassionate use program (CUP). Mobilization failure was defined as the inability to collect 2 \u00d710 6 CD34+ cells/kg or inability to achieve a peripheral blood count of \u226510 CD34+ cells/\u03bcl without having undergone apheresis. As part of the CUP, G-CSF (10\u03bcg/kg) was administered subcutaneously (SC) every morning for 4 days. Plerixafor (0.24 mg/kg SC) was administered in the evening on Day 4, approximately 11 hours prior to the initiation of apheresis the following day. On Day 5, G-CSF was administered and apheresis was initiated. Plerixafor, G-CSF and apheresis were repeated daily until patients collected the minimum of 2 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg for auto-HSCT. Patients in the CUP with available data on pre-mobilization platelet counts were included in this analysis. While patients with a platelet count <85 \u00d7 10 9 /L were excluded from the CUP, some patients received waivers and were included in this analysis. Efficacy of remobilization with plerixafor + G-CSF was evaluated in patients with platelet counts \u2264 100 \u00d7 10 9 /L or \u2264 150 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Results Of the 833 patients in the plerixafor CUP database, pre-mobilization platelet counts were available for 219 patients (NHL=115, MM=66, HD=20 and other=18.). Of these, 92 patients (NHL=49, MM=25, HD=8 and other=10) had pre-mobilization platelet counts \u2264 150 \u00d7 10 9 /L; the median platelet count was 115 \u00d7 10 9 /L (range, 50-150). The median age was 60 years (range 20-76) and 60.4% of the patients were male. Fifty-nine patients (64.1%) collected \u22652 \u00d7 10 9 CD34+ cells/kg and 13 patients (14.1%) achieved \u22655 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg. The median CD34+ cell yield was 2.56 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg. The proportion of patients proceeding to transplant was 68.5%. The median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 12 days and 22 days, respectively. Similar results were obtained when efficacy of plerixafor + G-CSF was evaluated in 29 patients with platelet counts \u2264 100 \u00d7 10 9 /L (NHL=12, MM=10, HD=3 and other=4). The median platelet count in these patients was 83 \u00d7 10 9 /L (range, 50-100). The median age was 59 years (range 23-73) and 60.4% of the patients were male. The minimal and optimal cell dose was achieved in 19(65.5%) and 3(10.3%) patients, respectively. The median CD34+ cell yield was 2.92 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg. The proportion of patients proceeding to transplant was 62.1%. The median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 12 days and 23 days, respectively. Conclusions For patients mobilized with G-CSF alone or chemotherapy \u00b1G-CSF, a low platelet count prior to mobilization is a significant predictor of mobilization failure. These data demonstrate that in patients with thrombocytopenia who have failed prior mobilization attempts, remobilization with plerixafor plus G-CSF allows \u223c65% of the patients to collect the minimal cell dose to proceed to transplantation. Thus, in patients predicted or proven to be poor mobilizers, addition of plerixafor may increase stem cell yields. Future studies should investigate the efficacy of plerixafor + G-CSF in front line mobilization in patients with low platelet counts prior to mobilization.
