    "abstract_text": "Background The age distribution character makes Multiple myeloma (MM) a geriatric disease. Several geriatric assessment models have built for the identification of the unfit patients and making individual treatments. However, their prediction value on treatment-related toxicities is limited or lacking. It is time to identify the significance of treatment-related toxicities. Methods A total of 119 patients consecutively diagnosed as active MM with previous untreated between 2010 and 2018 in Nanfang Hospital were reviewed. Results Among all 119 patients analyzed, 30 patients exhibited grad 3-4 non-hematologic adverse events (non-HAEs). The MM patients with non-HAEs showed more likely to present geriatric features, such as poor physical status (PS) and renal function, lower hemoglobin (HGB) and albumin (Alb), higher N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (P<0.01). Patients with non-HAEs presented poor overall survival (OS), higher drugs discontinuation rate and poor overall response rate (ORR) at 4 months (P<0.01). The multivariate analysis showed that non-HAEs is an independent unfavorable factor for OS, drug discontinuation and response at 4 months. Conclusions Non-hematologic therapy toxicities are correlated with geriatric features, poor survival, high drug discontinuation rate and poor response at 4 months.
