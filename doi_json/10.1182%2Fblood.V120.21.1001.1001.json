    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1001 Introduction: SCT occurs in 8% of African Americans and is not commonly associated with clinical disease. Nonetheless, the United States Armed Forces has reported that SCT conveys a 30-fold risk of sudden cardiac arrest and a 200-fold risk from exertional rhabdomyolysis. In fact, rhabdomyolysis in athletes with SCT has been the principal cause of death in NCAA football players in the last decade, leading to recently mandated SCT testing in all Division-1 players. In SCT, RBC sickle only under extreme conditions and with slow kinetics. Therefore, rhabdomyolysis most likely occurs in SCT when a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of factors converges to critically imbalance oxygen supply and demand in muscles. We hypothesize that in SCT subjects, abnormal RBC rheology, particularly aggregation and deformability, play an important role in abnormal muscle blood flow supply and distribution to exercising muscle. To test this hypothesis, we examined whole blood viscosity, RBC aggregation, and RBC deformability in 11 SCT and 10 control subjects prior to and following maximum handgrip exercise. Methods: Maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) was assessed by handgrip dynamometer in the dominant arm. Baseline blood was collected for CBC, whole blood viscosity, RBC aggregation, and RBC deformability. Patients then maintained 60% MVC exercise until exhaustion. Following 8 minutes of recovery, a venous blood gas and blood for repeat viscosity assessments was collected from the antecubital fossa of the exercising limb. Whole blood viscosity over a shear rate range of 1\u20131, 000 1/s was determined by an automated tube viscometer, RBC deformability from 0.5\u201350 Pa via laser ektacytometry (LORCA) and RBC aggregation in both autologous plasma and 3% dextran 70 kDa using an automated cone-place aggregometer (Myrenne). Aggregation measurements included extent at stasis (M), strength of aggregation (GT min) and kinetics (T \u00bd). Results: Baseline CBC and aggregation values are summarized in Table 1 . Both static RBC aggregation in plasma and RBC aggregation in dextran (aggregability) were significantly increased in SCT ( Table 1 ). The rate of aggregation formation trended higher in SCT but the strength of aggregation was not different between the two groups. In SCT subjects, red cell deformability was impaired at low shear stress but greater than controls at higher shear stress ( Figure 1 ). Red cell deformability was completely independent of oxygenation status states in both SCT and control subjects. Whole blood viscosity did not different between the two groups whether oxygenated or deoxygenated and prior to or following handgrip exercise. Table 1  . SCT . Controls . P value .

Figure 1: View large Download slide Plot of RBC deformability (elongation index) versus shear stress (Pa).  Discussion: Three important hemorheological differences were observed for SCT subjects versus controls: a) RBC deformability was below control at low stress levels yet greater than control at higher stress; b) The extent of RBC aggregation in autologous plasma was about 40% greater; c) The extent of RBC aggregation for washed RBC re-suspended in an aggregating medium (i.e., 3% dextran 70 kDa) was about 30% higher. RBC deformability is a major determinant of in vivo blood flow dynamics, especially in the microcirculation; decreased deformability adversely affects tissue perfusion. RBC aggregation is also an important determinant since it affects both resistance to blood flow and RBC distribution in a vascular bed (e.g., plasma skimming). The finding of greater aggregability (i.e., higher aggregation in the defined dextran medium) indicates that RBC in SCT have an altered membrane surface in which the penetration of this polymer into the glycocalyx is abnormal. The combined effects of these three rheological parameters is likely to impair in vivo blood flow in SCT, perhaps to a degree resulting in pathophysiological changes of the cardiovascular system.
