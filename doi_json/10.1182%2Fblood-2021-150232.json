    "abstract_text": "Background: Once multiple myeloma (MM) becomes refractory to \u03b1CD38 mAb, pts have limited effective treatment options and poor prognoses. With standard therapies, overall response rate (ORR) to the first regimen after refractoriness to an \u03b1CD38 mAb is 31%, median progression-free survival (PFS) - 3.4 months and median overall survival (OS) - 9.3 months (Gandhi et al, Leukemia , 2019). Exportin 1 (XPO1) mediates the nuclear export and functional inactivation of tumor suppressor proteins. XPO1 is required for MM cell growth, is associated with poor prognosis and mediates resistance to standard MM and other anticancer therapies. Selinexor (SEL) is a first-in-class, oral selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) compound approved for patients (pts) with previously treated MM as well as DLBCL. The doublet SEL-dexamethasone (Xd) achieved ORR ~26% in triple-class (Immunomodulatory drug [IMiD], proteosome inhibitor [PI], \u03b1CD38 mAb) refractory MM and improved OS over matched cohorts in community (Richardson et al, eJHaem , 2021) and academic (Cornell et al, AJH , 2020) settings. Hence, SEL-based triplets could be more effective in this triple class-treated population. We analyzed the efficacy and safety of SEL-containing triplets in pts in the STOMP study who were previously treated with regimens containing \u03b1CD38 mAb. Methods: STOMP is a multi-arm, open-label, Phase 1b/2 study evaluating SEL in various combinations (NCT02343042). Here, we analyzed ORR, clinical benefit rate (CBR), duration of response (DOR), PFS, OS, and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of pts who received Xd plus pomalidomide (XPd, n=23) or carfilzomib (XKd, n=23) after prior therapy with \u03b1CD38 mAb. Results: Among 46 pts treated, median age was 64 yrs (XPd), 70 yrs (XKd), females 57% (XPd) and 39% (XKd), median time from diagnosis was 5 yrs, and median number of prior regimens 4 (range, 2-10). All pts were previously treated with a PI and IMiD and \u03b1CD38 mAb; 78% (XPd) and 52% (XKd) had triple refractory MM. Prior treatment with \u03b1CD38 mAb included daratumumab (XPd: 91%, XKd: 100%) and isatuximab (XPd: 9%); 52% (XPd) and 74% (XKd) had \u03b1CD38 mAb in their most recent prior regimen. Refractoriness to daratumumab was documented in 87% (XPd) and 96% (XKd); isatuximab in 9% (XPd). Median durations from end of most recent \u03b1CD38 mAb therapy to first dose of study treatment were 8 weeks (XPd), 4 weeks (XKd). Among evaluable pts, ORR and CBR were 52% and 76%, respectively in the XPd arm (n=21; 2 pts were not efficacy evaluable) and 65% and 74%, respectively in the XKd arm. In the XPd arm median PFS was 8.7 months (95% CI: 7.6, NE), median DOR was 7.9 months (95% CI: 3.9, NE), and median OS was 21.8 months (95% CI: 8, NE). In the XKd arm median PFS was 15 months (95% CI: 12.0, NE), median DOR was 13.1 months (95% CI: 10.2, NE), and median OS was 33.0 months (95% CI: 20.4, NE). Among the evaluable pts, response to SEL-containing triplets compared favorably to the prior \u03b1CD38 mAb-containing regimen used at least 1 line earlier: XPd arm (n=21), ORR 52% vs 58% for prior regimen, CBR 76% vs 58%, median PFS 8.7 months (95% CI: 7.6, NE) vs 10.2 months (95% CI: 5.2, 20.5); XKd arm (n=23), ORR 65% vs 52%, CBR 74% vs 57%, median PFS 15.0 months (95% CI: 12.0, NE) vs 8.5 months (95% CI: 5.9, 17.3). The most common hematological TEAEs (total; grade\u22653) were thrombocytopenia (XPd: 35%; 30%; XKd: 78%; 39%), anemia (XPd: 57%; 39%; XKd: 57%; 22%), and neutropenia (XPd: 57%; 48%; XKd: 35%; 4%). Other common TEAEs (total; grade\u22653) were nausea (XPd: 74%; 0; XKd: 74%; 4%), fatigue (XPd: 61%; 4%; XKd: 52%; 4%) and decreased appetite (XPd: 48%; 4%; XKd: 48%; 4%). No cases of severe bleeding with thrombocytopenia occurred. Three pts (13%, all XPd) had febrile neutropenia (the outcome of which was fatal in 1 pt, deemed related to SEL and pomalidomide). TEAEs were managed with standard supportive care and dose modifications. Summary/Conclusion: XPd and XKd administered to pts with heavily pretreated MM, including prior \u03b1CD38 mAb therapy, exhibit tolerability and comparable effectiveness to that of the prior \u03b1CD38 mAb-containing regimen. These results suggest that the use of SEL-containing triplets, implementing the novel XPO1 inhibition mechanism, can provide prolonged disease control with good tolerability rather than recycling previously utilized drugs/mechanisms. The all oral XPd regimen will be evaluated in Study EMN29 against elotuzumab-Pd in patients who have received lenalidomide, a PI and an \u03b1CD38 mAb.
