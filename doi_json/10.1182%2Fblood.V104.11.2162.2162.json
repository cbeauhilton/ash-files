    "abstract_text": "While it has been established that c-Kit/stem cell factor (SCF) interactions are indispensable for normal mast cell development and functions, the intracellular signals that regulate the development and function of these cells downstream from c-Kit are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that p85 regulatory subunits of class IA PI-3Kinase (p85\u03b1 and p85\u03b2) play an essential role in regulating mast cell growth and maturation. We show that deficiency of p85\u03b1 in mast cells results in reduced growth and survival in response to SCF stimulation, which is associated with impaired activation of Akt, Rac and JNK MAP kinase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in addition to regulating growth and survival, loss of p85\u03b1 also impairs the maturation of mast cells as seen by significantly reduced expression of c-Kit and the IgE receptor on p85 \u03b1\u2212 / \u2212 mast cells compared to wildtype controls. To determine the extent to which Akt contributes to the growth, survival and maturation of p85 \u03b1\u2212 / \u2212 mast cells, we reconstituted p85 \u03b1\u2212 / \u2212 mast cells with a retrovirus encoding an activated form of Akt. Remarkably, p85 \u03b1\u2212 / \u2212 mast cells expressing an activated Akt completely rescued the proliferative defect associated with p85\u03b1 deficient mast cells in response to IL-3 as well as IL-3 plus SCF, and a 70% correction in response to SCF alone. The phenotypic abnormalities seen in p85 \u03b1\u2212 / \u2212 mast cells were surprising in light of the sequence homology and continued expression in these cells of p85\u03b2 subunit of class IA PI-3Kinase, and suggested that p85\u03b1 might function with specificity in mast cells in regulating c-Kit functions. To examine the relationship between p85\u03b1 and p85\u03b2 in regulating mast cell functions, we generated mast cells from p85 \u03b2\u2212 / \u2212 mice and compared them with p85 \u03b1\u2212 / \u2212 mast cells. We found that p85\u03b1 and p85\u03b2 perform qualitatively distinct functions in regulating mast cell growth and differentiation. We found that although deficiency of p85\u03b1 in mast cells consistently results in reduced growth and impaired maturation, deficiency of p85\u03b2 in these same cells results in enhanced growth and no significant defect in maturation. To further demonstrate that p85\u03b1 and p85\u03b2 play qualitatively distinct functions in regulating mast cell growth and differentiation, a genetic intercross between p85 \u03b1 +/ \u2212 and p85 \u03b2 +/ \u2212 mice was performed. Since mice completely deficient in both the isoforms of p85 (\u03b1 & \u03b2) die early in embryonic development, we analyzed mast cell growth and differentiation in mice that were deficient in the expression of p85\u03b1( p85 \u03b1\u2212 / \u2212 ) and heterozygous at the p85\u03b2 ( p85 \u03b2 +/ \u2212) locus, along with the appropriate controls. We found that heterozygosity of p85\u03b2 ( p85 \u03b2 +/ \u2212 ) in the setting of p85\u03b1 deficiency ( p85 \u03b1\u2212 / \u2212 ) significantly corrected the mast cell defect associated with p85\u03b1 deficiency ( p85 \u03b1\u2212 / \u2212 ) alone. Finally, we reconstituted p85 \u03b1\u2212 / \u2212 mast cells with a bicistronic retrovirus encoding EGFP and a cDNA for p85\u03b2, and found that p85\u03b2 could not rescue the mast cell defect associated with p85\u03b1 deficiency. In contrast, reconstituting p85 \u03b1\u2212 / \u2212 mast cells with a retrovirus encoding the p85\u03b1 cDNA completely rescued the mast cell growth defect associated with p85\u03b1 deficiency. The level of expression of p85\u03b1 and p85\u03b2 in p85 \u03b1\u2212 / \u2212 reconstituted mast cells was similar as determined by western blot analysis. Taken together, our results demonstrate qualitatively distinct functions for two closely related regulatory subunits of class IA PI-3Kinase in controlling mast cell growth and maturation.",
