    "abstract_text": "Background: Although classified by WHO 2008 as belonging to the category \u201cAcute myeloid leukemia and related precursor neoplasms\u201d, Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm (BPDCN) presents as an acute leukemia (AL) only in a minority of cases. There are only few studies describing the comprehensive immunophenotypic pattern of BPDCN in the bone marrow. Furthermore, given the rarity of this hematologic malignancy optimal frontline therapy is unclear. Patients and Methods: This retrospective analysis evaluates the diagnostic flow cytometry pattern and outcome of 9 patients who were diagnosed with BPDCN at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre between December 2008 and June 2014. A four tube 10-color flow cytometry (FCM) panel has been used to correctly make the diagnosis of BPDCN in 6 patients, whereas a 5-colour panel was used in the remaining patients in conjunction with immunohistochemistry. The following markers were included in the10-color panel: Tube 1: CD65 FITC, CD13 PE, CD14 ECD, CD33 PC5.5, CD34 PC7, CD117 APC, CD7 A700, CD11b A750, CD16 PB, and CD45 KO; Tube 2: CD36 FITC, CD64 PE, CD56 ECD, CD33 PC5.5, CD34 PC7, CD123 APC, CD19 A700, CD38 A750, HLA-DR PB, and CD45 KO; Tube 3: CD71 FITC, CD11c PE, CD4 ECD, CD33 PC5.5, CD34 PC7, CD2 APC, CD10 A700, CD235a A750, CD15 PB, and CD45 KO; Tube 4: nuclear (n) TdT FITC, cytoplasmic (cyt.) MPO PE, CD14 ECD, CD33 PC5.5, CD34 PC7, cyt.CD79a APC, cyt.CD22 A700, CD19 A750, cyt.CD3 PB, and CD45 KO. Results: Median age was 66 years (range, 25 to 91 years); 3 patients were over the age of 70 years. Fifty-six percent were males. All presented with skin lesions and 78% presented each with lymphadenopathy and bone marrow involvement. Cytogenetics were poor-risk in 2 patients, intermediate-risk in 3 and unknown or inconclusive in 4. By 10-color FCM, leukemic cells were in the blast gate (CD45dim/low SSC) and were positive for CD4(bright), CD33(dim), CD56(heterogenous), CD123(bright), CD36, CD38, HLA-DR, CD71, but negative for CD10, CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD16, CD19, CD34, CD64, CD65, CD235a. Other markers, such as cyt.MPO, cyt.CD3, cyt.CD22 and nTdT were negative, while dim cyt.CD79a was seen in 3 cases. CD7 expression was found in 5 cases, whereas CD2 and CD117 were found in single cases only. BM involvement by BPDCN leukemic cells ranged from 27% to 92% of the marrow cellularity. Skin involvement showed dense infiltrate of cells with blastoid morphology and characteristic grenz zone. Seven patients received front-line induction therapy with HyperCVAD with an overall response rate of 86% (4 complete remissions (CR), 2 unconfirmed CRs). One patient died of multi-organ failure during induction. Three of 6 responders underwent planned allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT); 1 patient has since died of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), whereas 2 are alive in remission with chronic GVHD, 12 and 14 months post transplant with complete donor chimerism. One transplant ineligible patient relapsed 22 months after achievement of CR1. Median follow-up of all patients was 12 months with a overall survival at 1 year of 59.3% for the entire group. Patients who underwent allogeneic HCT had overall survival at 1 year of 66.7% and for the chemotherapy group was 27.8% at 1 year.(p=0.34). Conclusion: An accurate diagnosis of BPDCN can be made by 10-colour FCM using a 4-tube acute leukemia panel. BPDCN demonstrates a characteristic pattern of antigen expression . Although front-line induction chemotherapy with HyperCVAD can yield high CR rates, allogeneic HCT should be performed in first CR for transplant eligible patients, as this appears to be required for long term durable remissions. For transplant ineligible or relapsed BPDCN patients, there is an unmet need for novel therapeutic agents. Disclosures Porwit: Beckman-Coulter: Speakers Bureau.
