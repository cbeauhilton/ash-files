    "abstract_text": "Purpose: To report our experience with large volume leukapheresis (LVL) for allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) transplantation, evaluating its safety and efficacy in 69 consecutive healthy donors. Methods: Donor medical records from 1995\u20132004 were reviewed. These consisted of 38 males, 31 females, age range 16\u201365 (median: 37). All were mobilized with G-CSF, based on a dose of 7.5 mcg/kg/day (median: 600 mcg, range 300\u2013960 mcg) for four days prior to outpatient LVL (Cobe spectra). Vascular access was femoral vein in 59 and antecubital veins in 10 donors. Pre- and post-LVL determinations included: WBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, serum potassium, and calcium (Ca ++ ). Oral KCL and oral/intravenous Ca ++ were given as indicated by laboratory values and symptoms. Catheter-related complications and blood product requirements associated with collection were assessed. Final CD34/kg recipient body weight (rec. BW) and recipient engraftment data was evaluated. Results: LVL was well tolerated by all donors undergoing a total of 74 procedures.  Data/LVL Procedure .

BW 8.2 1.36\u201333.9 View Large Adverse reactions were minor and occurred in 40% of the donors. Local parasthesias accounted for majority (86%) of the adverse events. Bone pain secondary to G-CSF accounted for the remainder of the cases and was well controlled with analgesics. Oral electrolyte supplements were administered in 61% of the donors. Eleven (15.9%) required intravenous Ca ++ during collection. There were no catheter-related complications and no requirement for blood products during or after collection. Target values of 2 x 10 6 CD34/kg rec. BW was obtained in 68 cases (98.6%). Engraftment was achieved in 92% of the cases (6 died prior to engraftment). There were no early or late graft failures. Median time to ANC recovery was 10 days (range 8\u201325 days). Self-sustained platelet count was achieved in a median of 13 days. Conclusion: LVL was a safe and efficacious method of allogeneic HPC collection. The use of a lower G-CSF dose for mobilization is more economical and well tolerated. This dose allows for adequate collection of CD34 positive cells. These cells support the sustained recovery from high-dose chemotherapy for allogeneic transplantation.",
