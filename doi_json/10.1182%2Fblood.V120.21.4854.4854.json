    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4854 The incidence of B cell Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) is steadily increasing with age and about 40% of cases occur in patients aged over 70 years. Some series have reported that low grade NHL lymphomas represent about 35% of all B NHL in elderly patients. However few data are available on the outcome of patients aged over 75 years. Methods We report in a retrospective study the outcome and management of 62 patients aged over 75 years and followed between Jan, 2006, and Jan, 2012 from 2 french centers (Amiens, Abbeville). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints were response rates, progression free survival (PFS), and toxicity. Results 62 patients were registered with median age of 80,4 years (75\u201392): 31 patients with follicular lymphomas (FL) and 31 other low grade LNH: 15 Marginal Zone Lymphomas (MZL) of witch 11/31 splenic MZL, 1 gastric MALT, 5 lymphoplasmocytic and 10 lymphocytic lymphomas. At diagnostic, evaluation included: computed tomography scan for 46/62 patients (76%), bone marrow biopsy: 17/62 (27%), abdominal echography for 13/62 (24%) patients, echocardiography 24/62 (39%) and positron emission tomography for 11/62 (17%) patients. Charlson score (0\u201327) was evaluable for all of them with a median score of 2(0\u20134). At analysis, the median follow up was 23 months (range 0\u201379). Median FLIPI was 3 (0\u20135) for FL and median IPI 3(0\u20135) for other NHL. 21/31 (68%) FL patients and 27/31 (87%) other NHL had stage III or IV in the Ann Arbor classification. 47/62 (76%) patients received chemotherapy: 27/31 (89%) FL patients and 20/31 (65%) with other NHL. 12/62 (19%) patients were undergoing watchfull waiting (11 patients with other NHL, 1 FL); 1 patient refused chemotherapy; 1 FL patient died before any treatment. 29/47 (61%) treated patients received Rituximab (R). In the FL group, 12/31 (39%) received RCVP (C=Cyclophosphamide, V=Etoposide, P=Prednisone), 12/31 (39%) RCHOP-like regimen, 2/31 (6%) chlorambucil, 1/31 (3%) corticotherapy alone, 1/31 (3%) radiotherapy alone and 2/31 (6%) chemotherapy plus radiotherapy. For other low grade NHL, 2/31 (6%) received RCVP, 3/31 (9%) RCHOP-like regimen, 10/31 (32%) Chlorambucil, 1/31(1%) Fludarabine, 4/31(13%) orally cyclophosphamide and corticosteroid. 17 on 47 treated patients (36%) were in complete remission: 10/27 (37%) FL and 7/20 (35%) other NHL. The 2-years OS was 67%: 61% in the FL group and 74% other NHL (difference not significative); the 2-years PFS was 68%: 60% for FL and 77% for other low grade NHL. In univariate analysis, OS was affected by IPI (p=0,02) and FLIPI (p=0,008) (figure), but not by serum albumin concentration \u2264 35g/L, lymphopenia \u22641G/L, or Charlson score. 25 deaths were reported (14 FL and 11 other NHL): 9 lymphoma progressions, 6 sepsis, 3 attributed to cardiac failure and 1 to pulmonary embolism. The most frequent side-effects were hematological: febrile neutropenia (15 patients) and cardiac: acute failure (4 patients). Conclusion Our results in older patients with low grade lymphoma compare favorably with results in younger population. IPI and FLIPI only affect OS whereas geriatric evaluation with Charlson score is not relevant, possibly due to the small number of patients and short follow-up. These results prompt us to realize prospective studies in this population, reducing toxicity and improving efficacy with novel approach. Figure.
