    "abstract_text": "Abstract 686 Introduction: Anemia of chronic disease (ACD), the second most prevalent form of anemia, is commonly associated with chronic inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic conditions. ACD is characterized by high hepcidin levels that decrease serum iron levels by inducing degradation of the iron exporter ferroportin. In contrast, a relative deficiency of hepcidin leads to ferroportin overexpression and iron overload. Hepcidin is transcriptionally regulated by interleukin-6 (IL-6) and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling. Binding of BMP ligands to type II and type I BMP receptors induces the type II receptor to phosphorylate and activate one of four type I receptors. We sought to identify the type I BMP receptor that participates in the ability of IL-6 to induce hepatic hepcidin gene expression. Methods: The four type I BMP receptors are Alk1, Alk2, Alk3, and Alk6. Alk1 is predominantly expressed in the endothelium. Alk6 is expressed at low levels in murine liver. In contrast, Alk2 and Alk3 are abundantly expressed in hepatocytes. Global deficiency of Alk2 or Alk3 is embryonic lethal. To selectively delete Alk2 or Alk3 in hepatocytes, we studied mice homozygous for Alk2 or Alk3 sequences flanked by loxP sites ( Alk2 fl/fl and Alk3 fl/fl , respectively) that also carried a transgene specifying Cre recombinase under the control of the albumin gene promoter ( Alb-Cre ). Eight- to 12-week-old male mice ( Alk2 fl/fl , Alk2 fl/fl ; Alb-Cre , Alk3 fl/fl , Alk3 fl/fl ; Alb-Cre ) on a standard, iron-replete diet were injected via the tail vein with an adenovirus specifying IL-6 (Ad.IL-6) or an adenovirus specifying green fluorescent protein (GFP; Ad.GFP), as a control (10 10 particles per ml for both). Seventy-two hours later, mice were euthanized, and blood was obtained for measurement of serum iron levels and transferrin saturations. Livers were harvested, and RNA was extracted. Hepatic levels of mRNAs encoding Alk2, Alk3, hepcidin, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1, a transcriptional target of IL-6), and Id-1 (a BMP gene target) were measured by qRT-PCR. Hepatic STAT3 phosphorylation (a marker of IL-6 receptor activation) was measured using immunoblot techniques. Results: Liver-specific deletion of Alk2 or Alk3 caused mild and severe iron overload, respectively. Injection of Ad.IL-6, but not Ad.GFP, decreased serum iron levels and transferrin saturations in Alk2 fl/fl , Alk2 fl/fl ; Alb-Cre , and Alk3 fl/fl mice. In contrast, infection of Alk3 fl/fl ; Alb-Cre mice with Ad.IL-6 did not alter serum iron levels and only modestly reduced transferrin saturations. Infection with Ad.IL-6 induced of hepatic hepcidin gene expression in Alk2 fl/fl , Alk2 fl/fl ; Alb-Cre , and Alk3 fl/fl mice. Hepatic hepcidin mRNA levels were markedly reduced in Ad.GFP-infected Alk3 fl/fl ; Alb-Cre mice, and infection with Ad.IL-6 failed to increase hepcidin mRNA levels in this genotype. Ad.IL-6 infection induced hepatic Id-1 mRNA levels in Alk2 fl/fl , Alk2 fl/fl ; Alb-Cre, and Alk3 fl/fl mice, but not in Alk3 fl/fl ; Alb-Cre mice. Infection with Ad.IL-6 induced hepatic STAT-3 phosphorylation and HO-1 gene expression in all 4 genotypes of mice. Conclusions: Taken together, these results demonstrate that the response to IL-6, as reflected by STAT-3 phosphorylation and induction of HO-1 gene expression, does not require Alk2 or Alk3. In contrast, BMP signaling, predominantly via Alk3, is essential for the induction of hepcidin gene expression by IL-6. These results suggest that selective inhibition of Alk3 may represent a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of ACD.
