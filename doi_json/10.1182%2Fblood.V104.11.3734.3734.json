    "abstract_text": "Background: Renal involvement in patients with sickle cell disease has been reported to be as high as 20%. This can take the form of proteinuria, decreased GFR, isothenuria or hematuria. Our own clinical observation of patients attending our sickle cell clinic or admitted to the medical ward at our institution suggests lower rates of renal involvement than previously reported. In this report, we evaluate Saudi patients with sickle cell disease (SS) at our institution for renal involvement. Patients and Methods: Consecutive afebrile patients attending sickle cell clinic or admitted to inpatient wards were screened. Serum creatinine, urine analysis and 24 hr urine collection for creatinine clearance (GFR) and proteinuria were performed. Data on demographics and co-morbidities (DM, HTN, hepatitis B and C) and medications were obtained. Analysis was performed using SPSS 10.0\u00ae. Results: 62 patients were available for study; results are summarized in tables. Seven of 48 patients (15%) had proteinuria >300mg/d while two (4.2%) had proteinuria of more than 1.0 gram/24 hrs. Nearly 20% had GFR < 60ml/min. None of the patients had renal tubular acidosis. Serum creatinine was normal in all patients including those with low GFR and proteinuria. Conclusions: Contrary to our initial believes, significant percentage of Saudi sickle cell patients, like others, have renal involvement with low GFR and proteinuria. Serum Creatinine alone doesn\u2019t indicate this decline in renal function. We recommend annual evaluation for proteinuria and GFR determination in all sickle cell patients, and those at risk should be aggressively managed with nephroprotective agents like angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.
