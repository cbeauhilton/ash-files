    "abstract_text": "Imatinib mesylate has revolutionized treatment of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia. Yet for women of child bearing age problems may arise during pregnancy. While continuation of the drug is in the interest of maternal health, the safety of this approach for the fetus has been questioned. Therapy is therefore usually immediately interrupted on recognition of pregnancy. Only three successful pregnancies have been reported to date in which imatinib was continued. A 34-year-old woman of Chinese descent in complete cytogenetic and major molecular remission (i.e. 3-log reduction of BCR-ABL transcripts) of her CML in chronic phase on 400mg imatinib daily continued treatment during conception and throughout pregnancy. After an uneventful full term pregnancy she gave birth to an apparently healthy son. The mother retained her major molecular remission. Routine screening for congenital hypothyroidism of her child however repeatedly revealed an elevated TSH, rising from 11 mU/l at the age of 1 week to15 mU/l at 4 weeks, associated with a relatively low free T4 of 24.8 and 17.4 pmol/l respectively. Thyroglobulin and thyroxine binding globulin concentrations were normal for age. The mother was euthyroid and had no detectable anti-thyroid antibodies. A mild primary hypothyroidism was suspected. An ultrasound showed no developmental defect of his thyroid gland and a 123 I scan with a perchlorate discharge test ruled out an intra-thyroidal iodide organification defect. There was no family history of congenital hypothyroidism. The child was put on levothyroxine and is currently doing well. Hypothyroidism has been noticed as a potential side effect of imatinib therapy in thyroidectomized patients receiving levothyroxine and has been ascribed to enhanced non-deiodination clearance of T4 (de Groot et al Clin Pharmacol Ther  2005 ; 78 : 433 \u20138 ). An induction of uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferases by imatinib was hypothesized as mechanism for an altered levothyroxine metabolism in these patients. Congenital hypothyroidism has to the best of our knowledge not been reported as a potential consequence of imatinib therapy.",
