    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2128 Clinical phenotype in \u03b2-thalassemia syndromes is determined by the degree of chain imbalance. An increase in \u03b3-globin production will compensate for the absent or deficient \u03b2-globin synthesis and will result in the amelioration of the chain imbalance, and hence an improvement in clinical features. The known genotypes of \u03b4\u03b2-thalassemia are associated with an increase in Hb F production, which results in the amelioration of the clinical presentation. Most \u03b4\u03b2-thalassemias result from deletions that remove the \u03b4- and \u03b2-globin genes, (\u03b4\u03b2) 0 with a compensatory increase in \u03b3-globin (Hb F) expression. We report an unusual case of homozygous \u03b4 0 \u03b2 + thalassemia that provides interesting insights into increased \u03b3-globin expression and the regulation of \u03b2-globin gene expression. An 8-year old boy of African ancestry presented with lifelong jaundice and pallor. He also experienced episodes of worsening symptoms. He exhibited frontal bossing, pale mucosa, scleral icterus, and moderate splenomegaly. He was known to have G6PD deficiency and was suspected of having additional erythrocyte pathology. The CBC revealed a Hb of 8.7, Hct 26.4, MCV 64.7, WBC 10,700, platelets 283,000, reticulocytes 2.2%, and total bilirubin 5.3. Hemoglobin analysis by HPLC and IEF revealed HbA 13.4%, Hb F 86.6%, and no additional components. Alpha thalassemia \u22123.7kb deletion was not detected. Globin chain analysis revealed \u03b1, \u03b2, G\u03b3 and A\u03b3I chains. DNA analysis revealed a novel Senegalese-type deletion of the beta and delta genes, resulting in a delta 0 beta + thalassemia. The subject's parents who were both from the same small village in Niger had normal hematology values. Their hemoglobin analyses revealed Hb A 94. 8%, Hb A 2 2.0%, Hb F 3.2% and Hb A 93.5%, Hb A 2 2.1%, Hb F 4.5% in the father and mother, respectively. They were both heterozygous for the delta-beta deletion identified in their son. DNA analysis revealed a breakpoint in the delta gene at nucleotides 54755\u201354760 and a breakpoint in the beta gene at nucleotides 62153\u2013 62158 [GenBank Ref ID: HUMHBB] with a 5 nucleotide \u201cCAACA\u201d bp region overlapping area. The subject, who is homozygous for the identified deletions, has a clinical phenotype of thalassemia intermedia. He has not yet required red cell transfusions. This is the first instance of a Senegalese-type deletion occurring in the homozygous state. The genotype provides insights into regulation of globin gene expression. While the \u223c7 Kb deletion in the \u03b4\u03b2-intergenic region may be responsible for the increased expression of the \u03b3-globin gene similar to Hb Lepore deletions, the continued low level expression of the \u03b2-globin gene is most probably the result of the juxtaposition of the inefficient \u03b4-globin promoter brought in the vicinity of the \u03b2-globin gene.
