    "abstract_text": "In recent clinical studies, it has been shown that ASXL1 is frequently mutated in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), in particular in high-risk MDS patients who have a significant chance to progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The majority of ASXL1 mutations leads to truncation of the protein and thereby to loss of its chromatin interacting and modifying domain, possibly facilitating malignant transformation. However, the functions of ASXL1 in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are not well understood. In this study, we addressed whether manipulation of ASXL1-expression in the hematopoietic system in vitro mimics the changes observed in MDS-patients. We downregulated ASXL1 in CD34 + cord blood (CB) cells using lentiviral vectors containing several independent shRNAs and obtained a 40-50% reduction of ASXL1 expression. Colony Forming Cell (CFC) assays revealed that erythroid colony formation was significantly impaired (p<0.01) and, to some extent, granulocytic and macrophage colony formation as well (p<0.09, p<0.05 respectively). In myeloid suspension culture assays, we observed a modest reduction in expansion (two-fold at week 1) upon ASXL1 knockdown under myeloid conditions. In erythroid conditions, shASXL1 CB CD34 + cells showed a strong four-fold growth disadvantage, with a more than two-fold delay in erythroid differentiation. The reduced expansion was partly due to a significant increase in apoptosis (5.9% in controls vs. 14.0% shASXL1, p<0.02). The increase in cell death was restricted to differentiating cells, defined as CD71 bright- and CD71/GPA-double positive. In addition, we tested whether HSCs were affected by ASXL1 loss. Long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) assays revealed a two-fold decrease in stem cell frequency. To test dependency of shASXL1 CB 34 + cells on the microenvironment, transduced cells were cultured on MS5 bone marrow stromal cells with or without additional cytokines. shASXL1 CB CD34 + cells cultured on MS5 showed a modest two-fold reduction in cell growth at week 4. In the presence of EPO and SCF, we detected a growth disadvantage (three-fold at week 2) and a delay in erythroid differentiation, similar to what was observed in liquid culture. ASXL1 has been proposed to be an epigenetic modifier by recruiting/stabilizing the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Active PRC2 can lead to trimethylation of H3K27 and silencing of certain loci. It has been proposed that perturbed ASXL1 activity may disturb PRC2 function, leading to reduced H3K27me3 and increased gene expression. Using an erythroid leukemic cell line, we downregulated ASXL1 and as a positive control EZH2, one of the core subunits of PRC2. We then performed ChIP and did PCR for several loci. Upon knockdown of ASXL1, we did not observe changes in H3K27me3 on any of he investigated loci. However, upon knockdown of EZH2 we observed more than 50% loss of the H3k27m3 mark for many of the loci. This implies that our observed phenotypes may not be conveyed via the PRC2 complex but maybe via an alternative pathway. Preliminary data revealed an increase in H2AK119ub, suggesting that the BAP1-ASXL1 complex may be involved. In patients, mutations in ASXL1 are frequently accompanied by a mutation of TP53. Possibly, this additional mutation is necessary to allow ASXL1-mutant induced transformation thereby bypassing the apoptotic response. Therefore, we modeled simultaneous loss of ASXL1 and TP53 using shRNA lentiviral vectors. Our data showed that while in primary CFC cultures shASXL1/shTP53 did not give rise to more colonies, an increase in colony-forming activity was observed upon replating of the cells. Furthermore, shASXL1/shTP53 transduced cells grown in erythroid liquid conditions revealed a decrease in apoptosis compared to the ASXL1 single mutation and an outgrowth of these double positive cells. Nevertheless, no transformation occurred in vitro . We therefore injected shASXL/TP53 transduced CB CD34 + in a humanized scaffold model in mice to determine whether transformation can occur in vivo . In conclusion, our data indicate that mutations in ASXL1 trigger an apoptotic response in CB CD34 + cells with a delay in differentiation, which leads to reduced stem and progenitor output in vitro without affecting H3K27me3.
