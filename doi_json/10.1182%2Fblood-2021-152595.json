    "abstract_text": "Background: Hypotensive transfusion reactions are adverse events typified by a sudden decrease in blood pressure that usually occurs within the first minutes after the initiation of a transfusion and resolves shortly after the transfusion is stopped. Due to current passive reporting practices, the incidence is likely underreported, but recent studies estimate an incidence of 1.3 cases per 10000 RBC units. The pathophysiology of these reactions are not fully understood. One hypothesis proposed is that increased bradykinin (BK), a nonapeptide released from cleavage of high molecular weight kininogen (HK), as seen with the use of negatively charged leukoreduction filters and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, is a major contributor to the pathophysiology. We have recently demonstrated that red blood cell derived microvesicles (RBCMVs) from aging red blood cell (RBC) units are able to trigger thrombin generation via kallikrein activation - a predominant enzyme to cleave high molecular weight kininogen (Noubouossie, Blood, 2020). Thus, we hypothesize that the same RBCMVs would lead to bradykinin generation and might explain these hypotensive events. Objectives: To determine if RBC storage lesion-derived microvesicles are able to facilitate HK cleavage and BK release. Methods: RBCMVs were prepared from 4 recently expired RBC units (42 or 43 day old, AS-3 preserved, prestorage leukoreduced, all A+) via a series of centrifugations and washes. RBCMVs were quantified and characterized using nanoparticle tracking analysis. Obtained RBCMVs were first assessed for the capacity to initiate thrombin generation in microvesicle free human plasma via a substrate cleavage assay. Next, RBCMVs were added to a buffer reaction containing prekallikrein and HK, and kininogen cleavage was assessed via western blot. RBCMVs were also mixed with microvesicle-free human plasma and analyzed for evidence of kallikrein activation, cleavage of high molecular weight kininogen, and bradykinin production by ELISA. Cohn fractionation of plasma was used to enrich for BK. Results: RBCMVs were enumerated and concentrated to 7.5 \u00b1 1.4 x 10 12 per mL (mean\u00b1SD size 160 \u00b1 29\u00b5m). RBCMVs were able to initiate thrombin generation principally via contact pathway activation, independently of tissue factor. In a buffer system RBCMVs demonstrated activity to generate kallikrein with a sequential high molecular weight kininogen cleavage in a dose-dependent manner. Exclusion of kallikrein from the buffer system or addition of the small molecule inhibitor of kallikrein - ecallantide - halted cleavage of kininogen. A dose-dependent cleavage of high molecular weight kininogen indicated that RBCMVs could cause BK release in plasma; this was confirmed via an independent assay of Cohn -fractionated samples. Conclusions: Results of this current study demonstrate that RBCMVs are leading to high HK cleavage via kallikrein activation in vitro . We suspect that the same mechanisms could lead to BK generation in patients receiving older RBC units, possibly increasing the risk for hypotensive events from transfusion.
