    "abstract_text": "Sleep disordered breathing including transient hypoxemia and hypercarbia are reported in 60-80% of adolescents and children with sickle cell disease (SCD); oxygen desaturation 50 mm Hg during sleep are associated with increased frequency of acute vaso-occlusion events and are suspected of contributing to microvasculature alterations. To assess the prevalence and degree of sleep-related hypoxemia and potential associations with cardiovascular functions in young adults with SCD, we performed overnight sleep studies using a Type II sleep monitor NOX-T3 (Carefusion, Inc), 6-minute walk tests, echocardiograms, hematologic and chemistry panels, and PSQI questionnaires in 17 adults with SCD, ages 21-30 years. Subjects were attending a sickle cell clinic solely for routine care with no expressed complaints of SDB. Exclusion criteria included acute clinical events, hospitalizations, or red cell transfusions within 4 weeks, and chronic transfusions. AHI>5 (significant apnea/hypopnea hypoxemic episodes) during sleep occurred in 7/17 (41%) of subjects, and these subjects had a higher median number of hypopneas (34 vs 12, p=0.005), and oxygen desaturation indices (ODI, 5.9 vs 2.0, p5 (median MV EA ratio of 2.0 vs. 1.5, p = 0.08). TR jet velocity >2.5 was found in 2/17 asymptomatic subjects; (both were in the AHI>5 group). General quality of life was lower in patients with AHI>5 (mean score of 38 vs. 48, p = 0.012). As prolonged and frequent hypoxemic episodes may increase risks for vaso-occlusive, cardiovascular, and neurologic events, these common findings of significant nocturnal hypoxemia in young adult sickle cell subjects strongly suggest that SDB should be investigated further in larger patient populations, and interventions initiated. The observations, in addition to prior reports, also strongly suggest that screening of young adult SCD patients for SDB should be performed on a routine basis.
