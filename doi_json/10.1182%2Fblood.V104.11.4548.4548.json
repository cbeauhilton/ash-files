    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are usually characterized by aggressive and heterogeneous clinical behavior and a poor clinical outcome, plus apoptosis pathways are known to be involved in their pathogenesis. As such, the current study attempted to investigate the overexpression of Bcl-2, Bax, or p53 using an immunohistochemistry method with respect to the expression frequency, different expression patterns according to the histology, and association with the progression of PTCL. Patients and methods: Paraffin-embedded specimens from 74 patients were analyzed immunohistochemically for Bcl-2, Bax, or p53 overexpression. The enrolled diseases included PTCL-unspecified (PTCL-U; n=45), extranodal natural killer cell/T-cell lymphoma (NK/TL; n=10), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (ATL; n=7), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL; n=7), and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL; n=5). Results: The overexpression of Bcl-2 was exhibited in 33 patients (45%), Bax in 17 patients (23%), and p53 in 33 patients (45%). Bcl-2 overexpression was strongly associated with advanced stage (p=0.021) and higher international prognostic indices (IPI) (p=0.038), and Bax overexpression with advanced stage (p=0.039). For further analysis, the cases were divided into 4 groups according to Bcl-2 and p53 overexpression (Bcl-2 \u2212 /p53 \u2212 , Bcl-2 \u2212 /p53 + , Bcl-2 + /p53 \u2212 , and Bcl-2 + /p53 + ), and the Bcl-2 + /p53 + group was found to be associated with advanced stage (p=0.008) and higher IPI (p=0.001), plus a lower response rate (p=0.10) compared with the other groups. Meanwhile, when confined to the Bcl-2 overexpressing groups, p53 overexpression was significantly associated with poor survival (p=0.05), as the 3-year OS rate was 82.5\u00b110.2% for the Bcl-2 + /p53 \u2212 cases, yet only 32.9\u00b115.7% for the Bcl-2 + /p53 + cases. Multivariate analyses for OS also found the co-expression of Bcl-2/p53 (p=0.004, HR 17.787) as an independent prognostic factor, together with advanced stage (p<0.001, HR 20.090) and higher prognostic index for PTCL (p=0.008, HR 4.212). Conclusion: Bcl-2 overexpression seemed to correlate with the progression of PTCL. As such, the contribution of the co-overexpression of Bcl-2 and p53 on the poor prognosis of PTCL may imply that a Bcl-2 mediated apoptosis mechanism interacts with a p53-dependent pathway in the progression of PTCL.
