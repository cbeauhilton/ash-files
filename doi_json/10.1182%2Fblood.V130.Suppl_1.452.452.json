    "abstract_text": "Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT) is a life-threatening (20-30% mortality risk) disease in which IgG antibodies against the heparin-PF4 complex bind and activate platelets via Fc\u03b3RIIA. Our laboratory has identified that the Apoptosis Signal-Regulating Kinase (ASK1), a MAP3K, is present in both human and murine platelets and potentiates many platelet functions. Given that ASK1 regulates platelet function, and that platelets are known to play a major role in the pathogenesis of HITT, we hypothesized that ASK1 is a novel regulator of HITT. To establish if ASK1 is activated downstream of Fc\u03b3RIIA, we first stimulated washed human platelets with anti-CD9 (700ng/mL). Anti-CD9 induces the activation of Fc\u03b3RIIA. We found that anti-CD9 induced a robust activation of ASK1, as measured by phosphorylation of ASK1 Thr 845 (a marker of ASK1's kinase activity). ASK1 exclusively activates p38 in platelets; therefore we also measured phosphorylation of p38 a marker of ASK1's signaling activity. We found that anti-CD9 also induced a robust phosphorylation of p38. To determine the role ASK1 plays in platelet-Fc\u03b3RIIA signaling and HITT, we crossed Ask1 -/- mice to Fc\u03b3RIIA +/+ (hFcR) mice. We found that genetic ablation of Ask1 did not have any effect on anti-CD9-induced activation of PLC\u03b32 or Syk in hFcR/ Ask1 -/- (KO) platelets compared to hFcR/ Ask1 +/+ (WT). However, loss of Ask1 did result in the complete absence of p38 activation in KO platelets following activation of Fc\u03b3RIIA by anti-CD9 (500ng/mL). Further, we observed that anti-CD9-induced integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 activation, \u03b1-granule secretion, and platelet aggregation were all significantly attenuated in KO platelets (P<0.01). These in vitro results strongly suggested that ASK1 plays a prominent role in Fc\u03b3RIIA-mediated platelet activation. To further investigate the role of ASK1 in HITT pathogenesis, WT and KO mice were subjected to an in vivo model of HITT by injecting anti-CD9 IgG. Platelet counts were measured in samples of whole blood collected at various time points post-injection, and compared to resting platelet counts taken before HITT was initiated. We found that KO mice were significantly (P<0.01) protected from thrombocytopenia compared to WT mice when injected with 250\u03bcg/kg anti-CD9. However, when injected with 500\u03bcg/kg anti-CD9, both WT and KO mice displayed the same level of thrombocytopenia. Despite not protecting from thrombocytopenia, when observed for signs of shock, we found that KO mice were significantly (P<0.01) protected from anti-CD9 induced shock compared to WT mice regardless of the dose. Taken together these in vitro and in vivo data strongly suggest that ASK1 regulates Fc\u03b3RIIA-mediated platelet activation, and that ASK1 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of HITT. Furthermore, these data highlight the much-overlooked ASK1/p38 signaling pathway as key mediator of platelet activation during HITT pathogenesis. ASK1 may be a potential target for the development of novel drugs to treat HITT. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
