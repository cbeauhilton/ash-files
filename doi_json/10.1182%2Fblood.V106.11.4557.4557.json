    "abstract_text": "Thymic function is characterized its importance of thymus to T-cell diversity in the periphery of both children and adults during both health and disease. The generation of TCR diversity occurs in the thymus through recombination of gene segments encoding the variable parts of the TCR\u03b1 and \u03b2 chains. During these processes, by-products of the rearrangements are generated in the form of signal joint T-cell receptor excision circles (sjTRECs). As sjTRECs are stable extrachromosomal DNA fragments, are not replicated during mitosis and thus diluted with each round of cell division, and are therefore most frequent in nai\u0308ve T cells that have recently left the thymus, their quantification is actually considered as a very valuable tool to estimate thymic function. Quantitative of \u03b4Rec-\u03c8J\u03b1 sjTRECs can direct evaluate the recent thymic output function, but it is unable to analyze the particular thymic output function of different TCR V\u03b2 subfamily naive T cells. The complexity of TCR V\u03b2 repertoire is an important factor for immune reconstitution, it should be established the quantitative analysis of series TCR V\u03b2-D\u03b2 sjTRECs to evaluate the levels of different V\u03b2 subfamily naive T cells. In the present study, analysis of 24 TCR V\u03b2-D\u03b2 sjTRECs was established by semi-nested PCR using 24 V\u03b2 subfamily antisense primers and 2 D\u03b21 sense primers. TCR V\u03b2-D\u03b2 sjTRECs were amplified in genomic DNA from mononuclear cells of 10 cord blood samples, 10 cases of peripheral blood from normol individuals and 11 cases with AML-M2. Different amounts of DNA (corresponding to 2*10 5 , 5*10 4 , 1*10 4 and 1*10 3 cells respectively) from all samples were amplified to estimate the frequency of TCR V\u03b2-D\u03b2 sjTRECs. The results showed that most V\u03b2 subfamily sjTRECs could be detected in all samples from cord blood and peripheral blood at 2*10 5 or 5*10 4 cells level, some of V\u03b2 subfamily sjTRECs could be detected in 1*10 3 cells level. Whereas the frequency of V\u03b2 subfamily sjTRECs were lower in peripheral blood T cells from patients with AML-M2 than in normal individuals (p<0.05). V\u03b219, V\u03b223 and V\u03b224 subfamily sjTRECs could not be detected in all samples at 5*10 4 cells level. The results indicated that V\u03b2 subfamily naive T cells could be detected with different frequency in peripheral blood of normaol individuals as well as in some patients with AML-M2. Lower frequency of V\u03b2 subfamily naive T cells was found in most AML-M2 patients.",
