    "abstract_text": "NUP98 gene encoding a nucleoporin located at 11p15 has been reported to be fused with about 30 different partner genes by chromosomal translocations in hematological malignances. NUP98/IQCG was cloned in a patient of Myeloid/ T-lymphoid bi-phenotypic leukemia with 47, XX, t(3;11)(q29q13;p15)der(3)(q29), +21 karyotype. However, NUP98/IQCG\u2019s ability for leukemogenesis has not been identified yet.In this study, we established a retrovirus-mediated murine bone marrow transduction and transplantation (BMT) model of NUP98/IQCG to investigate its oncogenicity. In our model, half of the NUP98/IQCG mice developed a penetrable and transplantable acute myelomonocytic leukemia ,which was similar to the phenotype of patient with t(3;11). It suggested that NUP98/IQCG could induce the disease development. To investigate how the fusion gene promoted leukemogenesis, we transduced NUP98/IQCG into primary bone marrow cells, and found that NUP98/IQCG-expressing cells retained the ability to generate colonies in serial replating, while seldom control cells did, which indicated the increasing self-renewal ability caused by NUP98/IQCG. Meanwhile, when induced by Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor, NUP98/IQCG -expression bone marrow cells showed enhanced proliferation in vitro. Further molecular mechanism studies revealed that NUP98/IQCG could be involved in both NF\u03baB and CREB pathways during leukemia development. In summary, we showed that NUP98/IQCG promoted leukemogenesis in BMT mouse model through increasing the bone marrow cells\u2019 proliferation and self-renewal capacity, which explained the fusion gene\u2019s oncogenicity in patient with t(3;11). Our mouse model will be a powerful tool both to investigate the leukemogenic mechanism of NUP98-related fusion gene, and to find the drugs for treating the disease.
