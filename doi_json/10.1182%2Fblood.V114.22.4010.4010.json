Methods Based on the crystal structure of platelet GPIb\u03b1 (PDB:1P9A), virtual screening was employed to identify active compounds. Compounds in SPECS database were docked to VWF binding site on the surface of GPIb\u03b1. The screening was carried out with the DOCK4.0 program. The 150 highest-scoring compounds were obtained for further bioassay and those with inhibitory activity of VWF binding to GPIb\u03b1 were investigated the effect on platelet activation and aggregation. Results We found one compound, designated it as YC148, blocked ristocetin-induced plasma VWF binding to recombinant N-terminal fragment GPIb\u03b1 (H1-V289) by ELISA method. More interestingly, YC148 did not inhibit ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation, on the contrary, it induced platelet aggregation itself in the absence of exogenous modulators such as ristocetin and botrocetin. A VWF A1 blocking antibody could not block platelet aggregation induced by YC148 despite it completely inhibited ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination. And YC148 also stimulated washed platelet aggregation where VWF was absent in the resuspension buffer. These indicated that the aggregation stimulated by YC148 could not the result from VWF binding. Flow cytomety also showed that YC148 increased P-selectin expression on platelet membrane and promoted monoclonal antibody PAC-1 binding to platelet. The platelet aggregation stimulated by YC148 was inhibited by anti-GPIb\u03b1 monoclonal antibody AN51 and 6D1. Conclusion A novel exogenous small-molecule agonist was found to activate platelet through binding to GPIb\u03b1. It provides us a new tool for investigating platelet GPIb outside-in signaling pathway in platelet adhesion and aggregation. Furthermore, the structure of YC148 may provide a structural basis for developing new hemostatic drugs based on the inhibition of VWF-GPIb interaction. The effect of YC148 on platelet from Bernard-Soulier syndrome or GPIb\u03b1 N-terminal fragment deficient platelet after in vitro cleavage will be further investigated.
