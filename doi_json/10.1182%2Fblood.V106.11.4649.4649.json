    "abstract_text": "The association of lymphoma with a plethora of secondary immune defects is well established. However, most investigations were performed many years ago and little is known about disease specific alterations of the immune system. From January 2003 to August 2004 50 patients with newly diagnosed malignant lymphoma were analyzed and compared with 50 healthy volunteers Corresponding in age and gender. Parameters of cellular and humoral immunity, including CBC, FACS analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations, cytokines (sIL2-R, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a), serum complement components C3c, C4, CH50 and total concentrations of serum immunoglobulin IgG, IgM, IgA were measured. The median number of CD3+ and CD4+ lymphocyte subsets (p\u22640.01) were significantly lower in lymphoma patients compared with matched healthy volunteers. The number of CD8+ T-cells was decreased in patients with bulky disease (p\u22640.01). High-intermediate/high risk lymphoma (IPI 3-4 or aaIPI 2-3) had significantly higher CH50 (p=0,02), C3c (p\u22640,01), sIL2-R (p\u22640,01) and TNF-a levels (p=0,05) than patients with low/low-intermediate risk lymphoma. Infectious complications after chemotherapy (n=14) occurred frequently in patients with high initial LDH (p=0,04), low number of CD4+ (p=0,02) or CD8+ T-cells (p=0,04) and high levels of sIL2-R (p=0,02) or TNF-a (p=0,03). Relapse (n=6) was also observed in patients with decreased CD8+ T-cells (p=0,04) and in patients with high C4 levels (p=0,02). These results indicate that tumor burden in lymphoma patients significantly influenced the number of lymphocyte subsets, serum cytokine levels (sIL2R, TNF- a) and complement components (CH50, C3c). IPI-score and clinical course (infections and relapse) were related to the immunodeficiency. We conclude that measurement of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets, cytokines and complement factors can be expected to improve existing methods of risk assignment in lymphoma.",
