    "abstract_text": "Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative treatment for primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allows otherwise ineligible patients to proceed with HSCT. Host factors in PMF such as bone marrow (BM) fibrosis, massive splenomegaly, and transfusion related allo-immunization increase the risk of engraftment failure, especially with RIC. Spleen directed therapy (SDT) is often used in PMF patients with splenomegaly to help with engraftment, however little data exists supporting this practice. This study was carried out to investigate the role for SDT and the predictors of outcomes with RIC HSCT for PMF. Methods :After IRB approval, the Mayo Clinic HSCT registry was queried for patients with PMF that underwent RIC allo-HSCT from 2005-2014. Disease and transplant related data were retrospectively abstracted and analyzed for HSCT related outcomes. SDT was defined as a therapeutic strategy with specific intent to overcome an enlarged spleen prior to HSCT and included splenectomy, splenic artery embolization, splenic irradiation, or JAK inhibitor therapy that was stopped <30 days before HSCT. Survival estimates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and means were compared using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using Cox regression modeling. Results :51 patients (67% males) with WHO defined PMF with palpable splenomegaly that underwent RIC allo-HSCT were included in the study; median age 57 years (range, 35-68). The median follow-up was 12.2 months, and at last follow up, 19 deaths (37%) and 4 relapses (8%) were documented. The median OS for the group was not reached (mean 34.2 months); 88% at 100 days and 60% at 2 years. 17 deaths were attributed to non-relapse mortality (NRM). There were 3 engraftment failures (6%). 32 patients (63%) developed acute GVHD (grades II-IV) and 24 patients (47%) developed chronic GVHD (all grades). Twenty-one patients (41%) received SDT; 10 (48%) splenectomy, 2 (9%) splenic irradiation, and 9 (43%) JAK inhibitor therapy (ruxolitinib). The SDT group had a median spleen size of 14.5 cm (range, 1-29 cm) below the left costal margin (LCM) and 13 patients (62%) with spleen size >10 cm below LCM, while the no SDT group had a median spleen size of 7 cm (range, 1-19 cm) and 12 patients (40%) with spleen size >10 cm below LCM; p = 0.01. Seven (64%) of 11 patients receiving splenic irradiation (n = 1) or JAK inhibitor therapy (n = 6) were eligible for IWG-MRT spleen response, and 2 (29%) responded (both in JAK inhibitor group). Of the remaining 5 patients, 2 had a response not meeting IWG-MRT criteria. There were no differences in age (p = 0.09), gender (p = 1.0), DIPSS + score (p = 0.35), or HCT-CI (p = 0.61) between the two groups. There was a statistically significant difference in engraftment failure, with all 3 engraftment failures occurring in the SDT group (2 splenectomy patients, 1 splenic irradiation patient; p = 0.02). Engraftment failures were not attributable to insufficient cell dose, donor specific antibodies, or identifiable host factors. The patient with engraftment failure who underwent splenic irradiation had persistent massive splenomegaly. There were similar outcomes with regards to relapse rates, NRM, and acute and chronic GVHD. In the SDT group, the median OS was 13.3 months; 81% at 100 days and 33% at 2 years. In the no SDT group, the median OS was not reached; 94% at 100 days and 68% at 2 years; p=0.13. In a univariate survival analysis that included age, gender, SDT, DIPSS+ score, HCT-CI, CMV status, ABO status, HLA matching, donor source, graft source, engraftment status, and acute and chronic GVHD, predictors of survival were engraftment failure (p = 0.02) and major/bidirectional ABO incompatibility (p = 0.02). Similar results were obtained when JAK inhibitor therapy was considered separately from other forms of SDT. In a multivariate analysis, engraftment failure (HR 8.2, 1.8-27.2; p = 0.01) and major/bidirectional ABO incompatibility (HR 4.1, 1.4-10.9; p = 0.009) retained independent prognostic significance. Discussion:In patients with PMF and splenomegaly, there was no demonstrable benefit from SDT. Predictors of post-HSCT survival included engraftment failure and major/bidirectional ABO incompatibility. These findings need validation in a larger cohort of patients.
