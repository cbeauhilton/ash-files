    "abstract_text": "Introduction: HSCT has been developed in few Wm cases and is nowadays challenged by other innovative approaches. However, high dose therapy followed by autologous HSCT (HD-auto) produces high response rate and some long term responses while allogeneic HSCT performed after either myeloablative (MA-allo) or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC-allo) regimens may be cure of Wm (Dreger 1998, Tournilhac 2003, Maloney 2006). Methods: We updated and extended our retrospective experience on 32 HD-auto, 11 MA-allo and 11-RIC-allo performed from 1990 to 2006 in 51 patients from 18 institutions. A MA-allo and a RIC-allo were performed in 1 and 2 cases respectively following relapse after a 1 st HD-auto. Results: Data are presented in the table.  . HD-auto . MA-allo . RIC-allo .

Chronic GVHD developed following 7 MA-allo [limited (n=5), extensive (n=2)] and 5 RIC-allo [limited (n=2), extensive (n=3)]. Conclusion: We confirm that autologous HSCT achieves some long term responses even in heavily pretreated patients. Allogeneic HSCT induces very long term disease control and may cure WM. Specially, the RIC-allo gives impressive results on disease control in a set of older patients, with refractory disease, mostly heavily pretreated."
