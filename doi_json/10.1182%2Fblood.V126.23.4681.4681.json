    "abstract_text": "Background: Some studies had indicated that the joint damage progression could not be prevented by low-dose prophylaxis regimen though it had been practiced and achieved good outcomes as well as largely reduced bleedings. we initiated a retrospective study to compare the different outcomes between low-dose and intermediate-dose regimen of tertiary prophylaxis for adults with severe hemophilia A. Methods: Data collected from the hemophilia treatment centre at Nanfang hospital from July 2010 to February 2015 ( median 2 years of follow-up), a total of 40 adult patients with severe hemophilia A (FVIII < 1%) who are receiving prophylaxis treatment\u22651 year and treatment data available were eligible for enrollment in the study, including 25 patients in low-dose regimen(F\u2021[8-15 IU/kg 1-2times weekly or weekly5 times) under prophylaxis treatment. Screening out patients whose dosage and frequency adherence both >75% in two groups, including 15 patients in low-dose regimen and 14 patients in intermediate-dose regimen, observed the situation that breakthrough bleeding events occurred in different time period after clotting factors' injection and calculate the proportion. Results: 1. There were no statistical differences between two groups in age, weight, age at first bleeding, age at first treatment, family history of hemophilia and history of hepatitis. (the range of p-value was 0.221-1.000). 2. Intermediate-dose prophylaxis regimen reduced ABR than the low-dose regimen (median 13 vs. 5.5, P=0.000), as well as AJBR (median 10 vs. 4, p=0.001) and the annual target joint bleeding rate (median 8 vs. 3.5, p=0.002) .Reduced median annual absent days was found in intermediate-dose regimen group (median 7.5 vs. 0, p=0.005). In terms of total annual usages of FVIII, the intermediate-dose regimen group increased 35% than low-dose regimen group(2630 IU/kg/year vs.1950 IU/kg/year,P=0.000), but decreased 63% ABR, 60% AJBR and 56% annual target joint bleeding than low-dose regimen group. There was no statistical differences between low-dose and intermediate-dose groups in terms of target joint numbers (median 1 vs.1,P=0.579) and annual severe bleeding events(median 0 vs.0, P=0.911). 3. There was statistical differences between two groups on the improvement of FISH(P=0.008). The proportion that patients' annual joint bleeding rate \u22645 in low dose and intermediate-dose group were 12% and 73.3%. When AJBR \u22645, the mean improvement of Fish score of low-dose and intermediate-dose group was 0.33 and 1.18, When AJBR>5, the mean score was -0.09 and 1.00 respectively, while the joint function still improved in intermediate-dose group.3. The low-dose group had higher proportion of breakthrough bleeding in 24-48h after FVIII injection (median 45.5% vs.27.95%, P=0.000), while intermediate-dose group got higher proportion in more than 48h after FVIII injection (median 60% vs.43.75%,P=0.001). Conclusion: 1. Compared to low-dose prophylaxis regimen, the ABR, AJBR, annual target joint bleeding rate, annual absent days and joint functionwere significantly decreased in patients treated with intermediate-dose regimen.2. It is indicated the intermediate-dose prophylaxis treatment would be better in long-term effect than low-dose regimenin improving joint function. 3. The low-dose group had higher proportion of breakthrough bleeding in 24-48h after FVIII injection, while intermediate-dose group got higher proportion in more than 48h after FVIII injection. Once every other day regimen is beneficial to further reduce bleedings in intermediate-dose prophylaxis treatment. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
