    "abstract_text": "IPI-504 is a novel inhibitor of Hsp90 based on the geldanamycin pharmacophore. When placed in rat, monkey, and human blood, IPI-504 rapidly converts to the known and well-studied compound 17-allylamino-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin (17-AAG). 17-AAG is the subject of multiple clinical trials for the treatment of hematologic and solid tumors. However, 17-AAG suffers from poor aqueous solubility necessitating the use of sub-optimal formulations to deliver this agent to patients. IPI-504 is over 1000-fold more soluble than 17-AAG in aqueous solution. In vitro , both 17-AAG and IPI-504 bind tightly to, and selectively inhibit Hsp90 derived from cancer cells. The cytotoxic effect of IPI-504, as well as its ability to stimulate the degradation of Hsp90 client proteins and increase the intracellular levels Hsp70, were monitored in two human multiple myeloma cells lines (RPMI-8226 and MM1.S). The effects of IPI-504 were compared to 17-AAG. We demonstrate that the actions of IPI-504 are bioequivalent to 17-AAG and that both compounds induce apoptosis in these cells and stimulate the degradation of HER2 and c-Raf. In addition, both agents stimulate Hsp70 protein levels. In all cases the EC50s are virtually the same for both molecules (~200\u2013400 nM). Furthermore, IPI-504 inhibits the secretion of immunoglobulin light chain from the RPMI-8226 multiple myeloma cells (EC50 ~300 nM). Importantly, IPI-504 is active in tumor xenograft models of multiple myeloma. The data indicate that active metabolites of IPI-504 accumulate in these xenografts long after these metabolites are cleared from the plasma compartment, suggesting that they preferentially accumulate in tumor cells based on their increased affinity to Hsp90 derived from tumor cells. In conclusion, we have developed IPI-504 as a novel, potent inhibitor of Hsp90 with greatly increased solubility over 17-AAG, and that IPI-504 is an active anti-tumor agent in vitro and in vivo .",
