    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3629 Poster Board III-565 Fanconi anemia (FA) is a heterogeneous genetic disorder characterized by progressive bone marrow failure (BMF) and acquisition of malignancies. The only cure for BMF is a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched BM transplantation from a family member or autologous stem cells before BMF develops. Therefore, mobilization of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from BM into peripheral blood (PB) for collection has been a prerequisite for the therapy. However, patients with FA show a markedly decreased HSPC mobilization in response to the traditional mobilizing drug G-CSF and the mechanism(s) underlying the defect remains unknown. Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSPCs) have been known to be the common progenitor of a variety of cellular components in the bone marrow microenvironment. MSPCs express/secrete cytokines, extracellular matrix proteins and cell adhesion molecules, which regulate the homing, migration, proliferation and survival of HSPCs in vitro and in vivo. Recently, we reported that Fancg-/ - MSPCs have a defect in hematopoietic supportive activity both in vitro and in vivo (Li et al. Blood, 2009). In the current studies, we show that Fancg-/ - MSPCs have significant reduction in HSPC recruitment as compared to WT MSPCs in a transwell assay. Furthermore, Fancg-/ - MSPCs have an alteration in the production of multiple cytokines/chemokines. Application of a neutralizing antibody to the cytokine blocked WT MSPC mediated HSPC migration in vitro. Furthermore, administration of the specific cytokine significantly increased HSPC mobilization in the Fancg-/ - mice in vivo. These results demonstrated that an impaired BM microenvironment, specifically MSPCs in Fancg-/ - mice, is contributory to defective HSPC mobilization. This study provides evidence of alternative clinical therapeutics for the mobilization of HSPCs in FA patients. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
