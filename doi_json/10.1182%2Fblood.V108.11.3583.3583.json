    "abstract_text": "Background: PXD101 is a small molecule HDAC inhibitor of the hydroxamate class, which demonstrates broad anti-neoplastic activity in vitro and in vivo. PXD101 has antiproliferative activity on multiple myeloma cell lines, and shows additive/synergistic effects with standard agents used in myeloma, against these cell lines. PXD101 is being tested as monotherapy and in combination with standard agents for treatment of multiple myeloma. Methods: The primary objective of this study was to assess the activity of PXD101 alone or with dexamethasone, in multiple myeloma patients (pts) who have failed at least 2 prior therapies. Response was measured using the Blade criteria. PXD101 was administered as a 30-min IV infusion on Days 1\u20135 of a 3-wk cycle, at a dose of 1000 mg/m 2 /d (900 mg/m 2 /d in earlier patients). Patients are initially treated with PXD101 alone for two cycles. At the end of cycle two and every cycle thereafter, pts are evaluated for tumor response and continue on the study as follows: pts with objective response or stable disease continue on PXD101 monotherapy, while pts who have progressive disease (PD) are treated with a combination of PXD101 + dexamethasone (Dex). Dex was given orally 40 mg daily on Days 2\u20135 and 10\u201313 of the treatment cycle. Results: To date, 24 pts have been enrolled, 19 for which data are currently available. These pts have received a median of 5 (range 2\u201310) prior therapies. Seventeen pts are evaluable, 12 of whom are evaluable for \u2265 2 cycles, and 5 evaluable for 1 cycle only; 2 pts are unevaluable due to inconsistent baseline that prevented response assessment. Of the 5 pts evaluable for 1 cycle only, 4 discontinued due to PD and one withdrew from study. The 12 pts evaluable for \u2265 2 cycles received a median of 4 treatment cycles (range 2\u201312); 6 of these patients went on to receive PXD101+Dex. In these 12 pts, duration of PXD101 monotherapy was for 2\u20134 cycles, with almost all pts (10) receiving only 2 cycles. PXD101+Dex treatment in 6 pts was for 1\u201310 cycles (10, 6, 4, 4, 3, and 1). In 12 pts on monotherapy for \u2265 2 cycles, there were 6 SD (duration 6\u201312 wks) and 6 PD. The short duration of SD in PXD101 monotherapy was attributed to patient withdrawal or moving to Dex addition in spite of disease stabilization. All 6 pts receiving PXD101+Dex had previously received at least 2 Dex-containing regimens. One pt had MR (duration 6 wks), and 5 pts had SD. One pt has had SD for 35 wks, with 90% decrease in serum M-component sustained in the last 12 wks; another pt has had SD for 15 wks. In 69 cycles of treatment there were 7 Grade 3/4 adverse events assessed by the investigator as potentially related to study drug. These include anemia (2), infection, respiratory distress, hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, and fatigue. Conclusions: PXD101 treatment has resulted in stabilization of advanced and progressive disease, providing clinical benefit to patients. PXD101 combination with dexamethasone led to an MR as well as long duration of stable disease in patients who have previously received multiple Dex regimens. These observations support the continued exploration of PXD101 in combination with other agents for treatment of multiple myeloma."
