    "abstract_text": "CLL results from the accumulation of monoclonal B lymphocytes that derive from a small fraction of cells with proliferative activity. Because expression of the DNA mutator, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is restricted to these dividing cells, they can develop new DNA abnormalities leading to more lethal disease. Hence, such cells are important targets for therapy. Our previous study indicated that the B-cell subset with low levels of CXCR4 and high levels of CD5 (CXCR4 Dim CD5 Bright ) is enriched in these cells (\"proliferative fraction\", PF), whereas the less vital, resting cells exhibit a CXCR4 Bright CD5 Dim phenotype (\"resting fraction\", RF). In this study, we focused on analyzing the significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between PF and RF. PF and RF were isolated from 26 CLL (13 U-CLL and 13 M-CLL) and microarrays (llumina HT12) were performed. Selected DEGs between PF and RF were confirmed by rtQ-PCR and/or by flow cytometry. Array data were interpreted using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). First, focusing on the Immunologic Signature of B lymphocytes with GSEA, we found the PF was enriched in gene sets shared with IgM memory cells and pre-germinal center B cells, whereas RF was enriched in gene sets in common with na\u00efve, IgD + B cells. Notably, the PF also shared gene sets with myeloid dendritic cells and monocytes. Protein expression of 10 myeloid markers (CD68, CD1c, CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD13, CD31, CD205, CXCR3 and CLECL1) was documented in PF B cells from 11 U-CLL and 11 M-CLL patients, and each was more highly expressed in the PF than RF. No difference in myeloid markers was observed between U-CLL and M-CLL, suggesting that this expression is independent of IGHV mutation status. DEGs were also determined based on expression ratios for PF and RF for each patient; t tests were performed using R. With a fold change cutoff of > 1.5 or < -1.5 and a level of significance of P < 0.01, we identified 198 genes significantly upregulated in PF and 88 in RF. The top biological-function categories identified using IPA indicated that these genes related to cellular development (n=37), cellular growth and proliferation (n=49), cellular movement (n=42) and cell survival and death (n=50). In addition, these DEGs mapped to 8 canonical pathways with Z-scores \u22652, the highest being the integrin signaling pathway (Z-score = 2.887). Twelve of 13 genes were upregulated in the PF and correlated significantly with the integrin pathway: ACTG, ARPC5, ARPC1B, BCAR3, CAPNS1, ITGAX, ITGB1, ITGB2, ITGB7, PFN1, RAC2 and RHOC. Upregulation of integrin subunits was confirmed by Q-PCR and cell surface staining by flow cytometry. Preliminary cellular adhesion experiments suggest PF bind to fibronectin coated plates, and those cells that bind survive better. Next, comparing PF and RF expression ratios for U-CLL vs. M-CLL revealed 502 DEGs in U-CLL and 179 in M-CLL; 144 genes were shared by both U-CLL and M-CLL. IPA analysis of the latter genes correlated best with integrin signaling, and the potential upstream regulators of these were IFNg, IL1, F2 and IFNa. The Rho Family GTPases signaling pathway was significant (10 genes) for DEGs unique to U-CLL. No significant pathway or bio-function relationship was observed in DEGs only in M-CLL. Finally, IPA analysis showed IL4 as an upstream regulator of DEGs unique to the PF of U-CLL based on upregulation of 12 IL4 target genes (APRT, CCL5, CDKN1A, DECR1, IL17RB, ITGAL, ITGB1, LTA, MAPKAPK3, PIGR, SAMSN1, TIMP1). Three other IL-4 targeted genes were paradoxically under-represented in the U-CLL PF (BCL2, CCR7 and VIPR1). The upregulated findings are consistent with PF B cells inducing T cells to produce IL-4 via co-receptors on B/myeloid cells that foster a Th2 response (e.g., CLECL1). In conclusion, gene expression profiling indicates that cells of the PF display a dual activated B cell/myeloid cell phenotype suggesting enhanced antigen-presentation capacities. Integrin signaling appears to be a key pathway for these cells which could foster cell proliferation, survival, and migration, especially in U-CLL clones where integrin activation can lead to Rho GTPases activation. Finally, genes regulated by IL-4 in the PF could be induced by interactions of autologous T cells with CLL B cells. These findings suggest antigen-presentation and integrin and IL-4 signaling pathways as therapeutic targets in CLL, particularly for U-CLL.
