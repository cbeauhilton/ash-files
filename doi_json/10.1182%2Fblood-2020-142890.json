    "abstract_text": "MYC is a key oncogene overexpressed by many cancers, however, its oncogenic mechanisms are poorly understood. MYC is also central to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common and second most lethal pediatric malignancy. Much of MYC's oncogenicity has been attributed to its transcription factor function, but data suggest MYC also deregulates replication in transcription-independent fashion. As a known master regulator of cancer transcriptomes and epigenomes, we hypothesize that MYC dramatically alters both gene expression and replication timing (non-random spatiotemporal process where some part of the genome replicates early, and other late) in both types of ALL - B-ALL and T-ALL. Conceivably, MYC exerts oncogenic effects upon the ALL transcription and replication programs, with some changes shared by B- and T-ALL, and others unique to only one. We aim to address two novel questions not been investigated before. First, in ALL, do the same genetic loci show aberrant RNA transcription and DNA replication? Second, how similar are the affected loci in two closely-related, yet distinct, ALL types driven by the same oncogene? The basis of our project is a unique double-transgenic rag2 : hMYC , lck : GFP zebrafish pre-clinical model we established, which is the only animal model proven to develop both B-ALL and T-ALL. We previously showed that gene expression profiles (GEP) differentiating zebrafish B- and T-ALL also distinguish human B- and T-ALL, making this an ideal model system to study human ALL. In this model, B-ALL and T-ALL are induced by human MYC (hMYC ) regulated by a D. rerio (zebrafish) rag2 promoter . Since B and T lymphoblasts both express rag2 , both lineages over-express MYC, causing highly-penetrant B- and T-ALL. Differential activity of a D. rerio lck promoter causes B cells to fluoresce dimly and T cells to fluoresce brightly, allowing us to identify and purify B-ALL and T-ALL by fluorescent microscopy and fluorescence-based flow cytometry, respectively. This unique model enables comparing B- and T-ALL in one genetic background. We have purified >20 zebrafish ALL (both T-ALL and B-ALL) and isolated their RNA and DNA. We are now analyzing RNA-seq gene expression profiles (GEP) and replication timing (RT) profiles via next generation sequencing (NGS). We will compare both ALL types to identify mRNA signatures that are unique to, or shared by, both types. We seek loci that shift DNA replication from early-to-late, or late-to-early, to define the regions that replicate at the same time in both ALL types, versus loci that vary by ALL type. We will also interrogate these data to determine whether GEP and RT profiles correlate with each other, and with known MYC target genes. In conclusion, GEP and RT have never been analyzed in the same cancer sample, or in related cancers driven by the same oncogene. Exploiting our expertise with the hMYC zebrafish model, we are delineating how MYC alters transcription and replication, to ascertain if these affect the same loci and define which loci are unique to one ALL type or shared by both. MYC hyper-activity is seen ~70% of human cancers - making MYC a crucial oncogene in human cancer biology, so our findings are likely to inform not only mechanisms operative in ALL, but also other MYC-driven cancers.
