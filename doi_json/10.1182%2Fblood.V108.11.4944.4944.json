    "abstract_text": "Translocation t(14;19)(q32;q13) juxtaposing BCL3 in 19q13 with IGH in 14q32, is a rare recurrent event found in patients with B-cell malignancies. So far, a few cases of well-documented B-cell neoplasm have been reported. We analyzed 34 patients with t(14;19) and 1 patient with a variant t(2;19)(p11;q13) collected by the Groupe Francophone de Cytogenetique Hematologique on the basis of cytogenetic abnormality. Clinico-biological data, morphological review, immunophenotyping with Matutes\u2019 score, conventional karyotype and FISH analysis with BCL3, IGH, CEP12, 13q14, ATM, TP53, 6q21 probes, and IgVH mutational status were recorded. The sex ratio was 22M/13F, the median age at diagnosis was 61 [39\u201389], the lymphocyte count was > 4\u00d710 9 /l in 96% of patients, and spleen enlargement was found in 47%. 31% (11/35) were morphologically classified CLL, 37% (13/35) atypical CLL, 20% (7/35) MZL; 79% had features of disease progression; 3 of the 4 latter were Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma, possibly transformed from MZL. 87% were CD5+, 72% had a Matutes\u2019 score < 3. The IgVH genes were unmutated in 9/11 cases. The time to treatment was < 1 year in 68% of patients. The BCL3 locus involvement was confirmed by FISH analysis in all cases. 46% of cases showed complex karyotype. The chromosomal abnormalities associated with t(14;19) were +12 (57%), 6q- (27%), +3 (15%), 11q- (15%), 13q- (13%), 17p- (12%), +18 (12%), 7q- (12%). Comparison with published cytogenetic CLL data shows that deletion 6q was frequent and deletion 13q uncommon. Trisomies 3 and 18, and 7q deletion are less common than in published MZL. The independent analysis of our series of CLL/atypical CLL and MZL gave the same tendency. The chromosomal abnormalities associated with t(14;19) are not specific, but their frequencies are between those of typical CLL and MZL suggesting an intermediary status between the 2 malignancies. The t(14;19) identifies a subgroup of B-disorders CD5+ and Matutes\u2019 score < 3, which could be of poor prognosis, based on progressive disease and unmutated status.",
