    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1233 Poster Board I-255 Introduction Cytogenetic analysis has become a routine part of the evaluation of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) because specific chromosomal aberrations have been shown to assist in predicting disease progression, treatment efficacy, and overall survival. One such abnormality is del(17p13.1), which has been found to be associated with a need for early therapy, poor response to conventional treatment, and shortened survival. Identification of recurring abnormalities in this region represents great interest to identify genes relevant to CLL progression and poor prognosis. Patients and Methods We performed an extensive review of 1213 patients undergoing metaphase cytogenetics study at our institution and identified 16 (1.3%) with a recurrent unbalanced translocation between the p arms of chromosomes 17 and 18 that results in a dicentric chromosome with loss of much of 17p and 18p. The clinical features of these patients were characterized. Results A total of 16 patients were identified to have dic(17;18)(p11.2;p11.2) representing a 1.3% occurrence rate. The median age at diagnosis of these patients was 57 years (range 37-68). The dic(17;18)(p11.2;p11.2) was associated with a complex (3 or more unrelated cytogenetic abnormalities) karyotype in 12 patients (75%) at the time that the abnormality was first identified, and eventually associated with a complex karyotype in 94% of patients. This abnormality was associated with trisomy 12 in 7 patients (44%) and with del(13q) in 5 patients (31%) with no overlap between these two abnormalities. IgV H mutational analysis was un-mutated in 88% of cases. Except for one patient who was diagnosed with CLL incidentally during a workup for metastatic tonsillar cancer, all patients identified with dic(17;18)(p11.2;p11.2) met criteria for disease treatment, with a median time from diagnosis to first treatment of 15 months. Of the 12 patients who received fludarabine-based therapy, 7 (58%) were refractory. Three patients have received stem cell transplant for recurrent/refractory disease, and 4 are currently undergoing chemotherapy. With a mean follow-up of 54 months, 4 patients have died, 21, 42, 49, and 92 months after diagnosis. Conclusions Our study combined with small series reported by others demonstrate that dic(17;18)(p11.2;p11.2) is a novel recurrent cytogenetic abnormality in CLL. Here we demonstrate the clinical significance of this recurring abnormality that is associated with young age at diagnosis, accelerated disease progression, decreased response to fludarabine, and shortened overall survival. The dic(17;18)(p11.2;p11.2) is frequently accompanied by other negative prognostic markers including a complex karyotype and unmutated IgV H status. Additional studies to further characterize the prevalence of this abnormality and genes that are disrupted by the translocation are warranted.
