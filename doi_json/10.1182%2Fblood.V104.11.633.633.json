    "abstract_text": "Progression of myeloma (MM) is considered to be a multistage and dynamic process of cell differentiation, survival, proliferation and dissemination. We have previously demonstrated the proliferative potential of purified CD45 low CD38 high mature MM cells in SCID-hu mice ( Yaccoby & Epstein, Blood, 1999 ), the ability of CD138-selected MM cells to produce myeloma in our novel SCID-rabbit model (Yata et al., ASH, 2003), and the interdependence of MM bone disease and tumor growth whereby MM cells induce osteoclast activity and are dependent on osteoclasts in vivo ( Yaccoby et al., BJH, 2002 ) and ex vivo ( Yaccoby et al., Cancer Res., 2004 ). The aim of this study was to determine the osteoclast-induced phenotypic changes associated with survival of MM cells in long term co-culture. CD138-selected (>95% purity) MM cells from 16 patients were co-cultured with human osteoclasts for up to 20 weeks. The pre-cultured baseline cells were typically CD45 low/inermediate CD38 high , CD19 \u2212 CD34 \u2212 . At the end of long term co-culture (>6 weeks) MM cells had BrdU labeling index (LI) of 2.5\u00b12.0 and their viability was 97%\u00b11%. The phenotype of co-cultured MM cells consistently shifted to a less mature phenotype, with CD45 expression increasing from CD45 low to CD45 intermmediata/high and reduced expression of CD38 from CD38 high to subpopulations with CD38 intermediate levels, as determined by flow cytometry and confirmed by qRT-PCR. Further flow analysis revealed that co cultured MM cells also expressed low levels of CD19 and CD34, and identified a small subpopulation of CD138 low CD45 high MM cells. Morphologically, the co-cultured MM cells uniformly gained plasmablastic characteristics when compared to pre-cultured cells. Previous reports suggested that IL-6 was important for maintaining subpopulation of CD45-expressing MM cells. However, blocking IL-6 activity in co-cultures with anti-IL6 and anti-IL6R neutralizing antibodies (5 \u03bcg/ml, each) did not affect the immature phenotype of MM cells. Intriguingly, long term co-culture of normal CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with osteoclasts results in loss of CD34 expression, suggesting a common mechanism for osteoclast-induced MM PC and HSC plasticity. To investigate if the observed phonotypic changes are associated with apoptosis resistance, we determined the effects of 3 days exposure to the pro-apoptotic agent dexamethasone (DEX, 10 \u22127 M) on MM cells cultured alone or in co-cultures (n=5), at initiation (baseline) and after 6 weeks of co-cultures. The percent apoptotic cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion and annexin V flow cytometry. When baseline MM cells were cultured alone, DEX significantly increased the percent of apoptotic cells over that spontaneous rate (p<0.01). In contrast, when MM cells recovered from co-cultures after 6 weeks they survived and were resistant to DEX-induced apoptosis (16%\u00b111% and 24%\u00b121% apoptotic cells in the absence and presence of DEX, respectively). As reported, osteoclasts supported survival of MM cells at baseline and after 6 weeks of co-culture (p<0.01), and protected MM PCs from DEX-induced apoptosis. Our data demonstrate the phenotypic plasticity of primary myeloma cells, whereby mature MM cells are reprogrammed and acquire autonomous survival properties after co-culture with osteoclasts. We hypothesize that in vivo these cells are dormant, resistant to spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis, and could be responsible for relapse."
