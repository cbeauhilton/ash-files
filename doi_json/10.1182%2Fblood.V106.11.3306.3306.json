    "abstract_text": "Compelling evidence indicate that regulatory T (Treg) cells play an important role in the maintenance of immune tolerance to self and foreign antigens (Ag). Various subsets of T lymphocytes have been isolated in mice and humans that have the ability to down-regulate the proliferation of autoimmune effector cells. Recently, a novel subset of Ag-specific T-cell receptor (TCR)\u03b1\u03b2 + CD4 \u2212 CD8 \u2212 (double negative, DN) Treg cells has been found to be able to prevent the rejection of skin and heart allografts by specifically inhibiting the function of anti-graft-specific CD8 + T cells. Here we demonstrate that peripheral DN Treg cells are present in humans, where they constitute about 1% of total CD3 + T cells, and consist of both nai\u0308ve and Ag-experienced cells. Furthermore, analysis of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) indicate that DN T cells are not recent thymic emigrants, but rather an expanded T-cell subset. MHC multimer staining revelaed a distinct population of DN T cells recognizing common MHC class I-restricted CMV and EBV antigens. DN T cells exhibited a strong proliferative response upon stimulation with allogeneic antigen presenting cells (APC) and secreted high amounts of IFN-\u03b3 but no IL-2, with some IL-5, and marginal levels of IL-4 and IL-10. Similar to murine DN Treg cells, human DN Treg cells are able to acquire peptide-HLA-A2 complexes from APCs by cell contact-dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, such acquired peptide-HLA complexes appear to be functionally active, in that CD8 + T cells specific for the HLA-A2-restricted self peptide, Melan-A, became sensitive to apoptosis by neighboring DN T cells after acquisition of Melan-A-HLA-A2 complexes and revealed a reduced proliferative response. These results demonstrate for the first time that a sizeable population of peripheral DN Treg cells exists in humans that are able to suppress Ag-specific T cells. DN Treg cells may serve to limit clonal expansion of allo-Ag-specific T cells after transplantation.",
