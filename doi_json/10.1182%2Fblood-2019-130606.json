    "abstract_text": "Background: Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis, characterized by the infiltration of tissues by foamy CD68 + CD1a - histiocytes, with 1500 known-cases since 90 years. Mutations activating the MAPK pathway are found in more than 80% of ECD patients, mainly the BRAF V600E in 57 to 70%. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement during ECD lead to significant morbidity and mortality. We assessed CNS manifestations in a French cohort of 253 ECD patients. Since 2012, close to 200 patients worldwide with multi-systemic and refractory ECD (e.g. heart and/or CNS involvements) have benefited from BRAF and MEK inhibitors, which have proven highly beneficial. Methods: CNS manifestations were determined by clinical examination and brain and/or spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Targeted therapy efficacy was assessed using physician and radiologist global assessment. Results: Ninety-seven (38%) among the 253 of the whole cohort of ECD patients had CNS involvement. CNS involvement was significantly associated with a younger age at diagnosis (mean 55.5 years) and at symptoms onset (mean 50.5 years), and also with the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation (in 77% of cases), xanthelasma (34%), and diabetes insipidus (36%). Median survival among patients with CNS involvement was significantly lower than in ECD patients without CNS involvement (124 months versus 146 months, p=0.03). Seventy-four CNS MRI were centrally reviewed, corresponding to 3 patterns: tumoral in 66%, degenerative in 50%, and vascular in 18%. Targeted therapy (BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors) was associated with improvement of symptoms in 43% of patients, and MRI improvement in 45%. Conclusions: CNS manifestations are typically associated with a poor prognosis in ECD. Three distinct patterns may be recognized: tumoral, degenerative, and vascular. Targeted therapy leads to clinical and/or imaging improvement in almost 50% of patients. OffLabel Disclosure: Targeted therapies such as BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib) and MEK inhibitor (cobimetinib) are used in severe histiocytosis in EU but are off label"
