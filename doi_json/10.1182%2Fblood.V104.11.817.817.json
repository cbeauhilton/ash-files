    "abstract_text": "Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and its receptor (G-CSFR) are essential for neutrophil development. The G-CSF/G-CSFR pathway supplies normal circulating neutrophil levels and supports neutrophil terminal maturation. These activities have been exploited clinically, where G-CSF is used frequently to treat congenital or therapeutically induced neutropenia, or to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells for bone marrow transplant. Previous work from our laboratory and others has shown a role for the major G-CSF-responsive signaling molecule STAT3 in granulopoiesis. It is well established that STAT3 has an important negative function in controlling neutrophil production. Importantly, our studies have elucidated a critical positive regulatory role for STAT3 in G-CSF-responsiveness and development of functional neutrophils in vivo. Mice lacking STAT3 in the bone marrow (TIE2cre/Stat3 f/\u0394 ) fail to upregulate circulating neutrophil levels in response to a single dose of G-CSF administered subcutaneously, while their wild type littermates demonstrate a two-fold increase in circulating neutrophil levels (e.g., Gr-1 + /CD11b + cells) under these conditions. Inspection of bone marrow responses revealed an increase in the Gr-1 lo /CD11b hi population and a corresponding decrease in the Gr-1 hi /CD11b hi population of littermate control animals following G-CSF administration. Strikingly, mice that lack functional STAT3 in the bone marrow fail to respond to G-CSF similarly; these animals do not demonstrate an induction in the Gr-1 lo /CD11b hi population, or a decrease in the Gr-1 hi /CD11b hi population within the bone marrow following G-CSF treatment. These results indicate that in vivo G-CSF administration recruits early progenitors (e.g., Gr-1 lo /CD11b hi cells) into the granulocytic lineage while concomitantly decreasing levels of more mature granulocytes (e.g., Gr-1 hi /CD11b hi ) within the marrow, which are likely mobilized to the peripheral circulation, and suggest an essential role for STAT3 in these responses. Furthermore, neutrophils isolated from TIE2cre/Stat3 f/\u0394 mice demonstrate defective chemotaxis in response to MIP-2. This deficiency appears to be cell autonomous since granulocytes derived from an ex vivo differentiation system show a similar phenotype. Defective chemotaxis may be due in part to improper actin rearrangement dynamics, since STAT3 deficient neutrophils show enhanced actin polymerization in response to MIP-2 compared to wild type controls. To examine potential pathways by which STAT3 may function, we investigated the expression of the PU.1 transcription factor in TIE2cre/Stat3 f/\u0394 mice. PU.1 is known to control expression of genes that are essential for mature neutrophil functions. Our results demonstrate that PU.1 is expressed at high levels in the Gr-1 lo /CD11b hi population relative to the Gr-1 hi /CD11b hi population isolated from bone marrow of wild type mice. Ex vivo G-CSF treatment of wild type bone marrow stimulates an increase in the proportion of Gr-1 lo /CD11b hi cells within the culture, as well as the total PU.1 protein level of the population. By contrast, induction of Gr-1 lo /CD11b hi cells and total PU.1 expression by G-CSF treatment ex vivo is abrogated in bone marrow from TIE2cre/Stat3 f/\u0394 mice. Importantly, these effects are not due to significant changes in cell survival or selection in the ex vivo culture system. Collectively, our results indicate that STAT3 is essential for G-CSF-mediated neutrophil responses and function in vivo, and suggest that STAT3-dependent regulation of PU.1 may be an important intermediate in this pathway.",
