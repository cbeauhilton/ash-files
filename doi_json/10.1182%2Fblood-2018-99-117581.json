    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUNDS: Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by peripheral blood platelet count<100x10^9/L and increased risk of bleeding, but its exact pathogenesis remains unclear. Previous researches mostly emphasized on periphral blood, in order to elucidate the pathogenesis and provide new strategies for treatment, a series of studies about bone marrow B cells were carried out in our investigation. METHODS: 5ml bone marrow blood samples from 11 newly diagnosed ITP patients and 7 allo-HSCT healthy donors were collected into heparin anticoagulant tubes , bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) were separated with Ficoll density gradient-centrifugation in two hours. Different subsets of B lymphocytes were determined by multicolor flow cytometry including naive B cells, total memory B cells , plasma cells and regulatory B cells (Bregs) ,as well as some chemokine receptors of B cells (CXCR5, BAFFR, BCMA, TACI) . RNA were extracted from BMMCs using Trizol reagent, transcription factors related to development and differentiation of B cells (PRDM1, Pax5, IRF-4, XBP1) were detected by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The percentage of B cells (CD19 + ) in bone marrow lymphocytes in ITP patients was significantly lower than that in healthy donors (6.16\u00b10.74% vs . 17.28\u00b12.43%, P < 0.0001). The proportion of naive B (CD19 + CD27 - ) in B cells was also lower compared with normal controls (59.11\u00b17.60% vs . 81.58\u00b14.00%, P =0.041), and the proportion of memory B (CD19 + CD27 + ) was higher(40.17\u00b17.67% vs. 18.01\u00b13.89%, P =0.045),but there was no significant difference in plasma cells (CD19 - CD138 + ). Besides,there was a decrease of Breg (CD19 + CD24 high CD38 high ) in ITP patients compared with healthy donors (20.33\u00b15.05% vs. 57.98\u00b19.76% , P = 0.008), and its percentage of total lymphocytes was also significantly lower unsurprisingly (1.38\u00b10.38% vs. 12.23\u00b12.88%, P < 0.001). The level of BAFFR in mature B cells was elevated in ITP patients (80.72\u00b14.53% vs . 45.81\u00b18.49%, P = 0.002). However, no significant difference was observed in other three chemokine receptors. All four Transcription factors related to B cell development and differentiation was not found to be significantly different between ITP patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that memory B cells which represent the active form were increased, and Bregs which mediate immune tolerance were much more decreased in ITP patients. As BAFFR is the only specific receptor of B cell activating factor(BAFF), its elevated expression suggested the BAFF-BAFFR system enhanced chemotactic function of B cells in ITP patients. All those results indicated that the bone marrow B cells in patients with ITP were in a state of immune overstimulation, this may potentially constitute a novel therapeutic target. Figure.
