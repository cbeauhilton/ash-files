    "abstract_text": "The basic helix-loop-helix protein TAL-1/SCL, essential for the formation of the hematopoietic system, is also required for vascular development and more particularly for embryonic angiogenesis. We previously reported that TAL-1 acts as a positive factor for post-natal angiogenesis by stimulating endothelial morphogenesis. To understand how TAL-1 modulates angiogenesis, we investigated the functional consequences of TAL-1 silencing, mediated by small-interfering RNAs, in human primary endothelial cells (ECs). We found that TAL-1 knockdown impaired in vitro EC tubulomorphogenesis (in 2-D on Matrigel or 3-D in collagen I gel), with the notable absence of cell-cell contacts, a prerequisite for morphogenesis initiation. This cellular deficiency was associated with a dramatic reduction in the vascular-endothelial (VE)-cadherin at intercellular junctions, the major component of endothelial adherens junctions. In contrast, PECAM (or CD31) was present at cell-cell junctions at the same levels as control cells. Importantly, silencing of two known TAL-1-partners in hematopoietic cells, E47 or LMO2, produce the same effects as TAL-1. Accordingly, silencing of TAL-1, as well as E47 and LMO2, provoked down-regulation of VE-cadherin at both the mRNA and protein levels. Transient transfection experiments in HUVECs showed that TAL-1 and E47 regulate the VE-cadherin promoter through a specialized E-box element. Finally, endogenous VE-cadherin transcription could be directly activated in non-endothelial HEK-293 cells that neither express TAL-1 or LMO2, by the sole concomitant ectopic expression of TAL-1, E47 and LMO2. Overall, our data demonstrate that a multiprotein complex containing at least TAL-1, LMO2 and E47 act upstream of the VE-cadherin gene. We are currently performing chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to investigate whether the TAL-1-containing complex binds in vivo the VE-cadherin promoter. This study identifies VE-cadherin as an upstream TAL-1-target gene in the endothelial lineage, and provides a first clue in TAL-1 function in the control of angiogenesis."
