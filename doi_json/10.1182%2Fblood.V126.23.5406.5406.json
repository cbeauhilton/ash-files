    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Direct intra bonemarrow (IBM) infusion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) is assumed to improve the homing efficiency and to accelerate the early engraftment in comparison to the conventional intravenous application of HSC. Especially for transplantation of low cell numbers i.e. \"weak grafts\" that is generally associated with delayed engraftment. The direct infusion of HSC in close proximity to the HSC niche by intra bone marrow transplantation (IBMT) might be a promising way. Whether the HSC infusion rate might influence the homing process and therefore the outcome after IBMT is so far unknown. Aims: Herein, we analyzed in a canine DLA-identical littermate model the impact of different graft infusion rates on the hematopoietic recovery as well as on the engraftment kinetics after IBMT following reduced intensity conditioning. Methods: Recipient dogs received IBMT following a 4.5 Gy total body irradiation (TBI). From day (d) -1 until d+35 Cyclosporin A (15mg/kg) was administered orally twice a day as immunosuppression. For IBM transfusion the graft volume was reduced by buffy coat centrifugation and dogs obtained 2x25 ml simultaneously into the humerus and femur. The infusion rate of the graft was 25ml/10 min in group 1 (IBM10, n = 8) and 25 ml/60 min in group 2 (IBM60, n = 7). A 28 day follow-up is currently available for twelve dogs (IBM10 n = 7; IBM60 n = 5). The development of the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and granulocyte chimerism was tested weekly. Blood count, kidney and liver enzymes were monitored routinely. Results: All animals engrafted. One dog of the IBM10 group died at d+15 (infection) and was therefore not included into analysis. The median number of infused total nucleated cells were in IBM10 4.1*10 8 /kg (range 2.3-6.0*10 8 /kg) and in IBM60 3.2*10 8 /kg (range 1.8-4.4*10 8 /kg; p=0.4). The infused CD34 + numbers were median 3.2*10 6 /kg (range: 1.2-10.0*10 6 /kg; IBM10) and 3.6*10 6 /kg (range: 1.5-6.8*10 6 /kg; IBM60; p=0.7). Time of leukocyte recovery was median d+11 after IBMT in both groups (range: d+4 to d+11, IBM10; d+8 to d+14, IBM60; p= 0.5). Median leukocytes nadirs amounted to 0.2*10 9 /l for IBM10 and 0.3*10 9 /l for IBM60 (p= 0.08). The median duration of leukopenia (<1*10 9 /l) were similar (6d, range: 4-11d, IBM10; 3-9d, IBM60) (p= 0.6). Median platelet nadir was 0*10 9 /l for both cohorts (range: 0.0-7.0*10 9 /l, IBM10; 0.0-1.0*10 9 /l, IBM60). The period of thrombocytopenia (\u226420.0*10 9 /l) was significantly prolonged in the IBM60 group (median 10d, range) compared to 5d (range: 3-12d) in the IBM10 group (p=0.05). Donor PBMC chimerisms at d+7, d+14 and d+28 were median 22% (range: 8-34%), 50% (range: 29-53%) and 67% (range: 47-73%) in IBM10. The results of PBMC chimerism for IBM60 were 11% (range: 5-34%), 42% (range: 20-42%) and 59% (range: 44-66%) at these time points (p = n.s.). Donor granulocyte chimerisms of median 33% (range: 11-83%), 100% (range: 58-100%) and 100% (range: 82-100%) were detected at d+7, d+14 and d+28 after HSCT in IBM10, respectively. The granulocyte chimerism in IBM60 amounted to 34% (range: 3-87%), 96% (range: 94-100%) and 98% (range: 96-100%) at the above mentioned time points p=n.s. for all time points). Conclusion: Our data suggest that early granulocyte and PBMC engraftment is not influenced by modification of the HSC infusion rate. However, the period of thrombocytopenia seems to be prolonged following a 60 minutes application. Therefore, longer infusion times in an IBMT setting seem not to be beneficial following toxicity reduced conditioning regimen. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
