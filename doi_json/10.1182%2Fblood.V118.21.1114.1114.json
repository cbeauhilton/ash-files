    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1114 Antibodies directed against the B-cell associated CD20 surface antigen can target normal as well as malignant B cells. They are sucessfully used for the treatment of B-cell derived leukemia and lymphoma and antibody mediated autoimmune disease, respectively. We have previously described that bispecific antibodies with specificity for CD20 and the death receptor CD95 are capable of inducing CD95 mediated apoptosis selectively in CD20-positive lymphoma cells. We now show that CD20 X CD95 hybrid antibodies induce apoptosis in pokeweed mitogen (PWM) activated B cells expressing CD95, but not in resting cells lacking it. Antibody production induced by PWM in vitro is profoundly inhibited. These results indicate that bispecific CD20 X CD95 antibodies may be used for the treatment of antibody mediated autoimmune disease. Compared to monospecific CD20 antibodies these reagents offer a new effector principle and specificity for activated rather than resting B cells. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
