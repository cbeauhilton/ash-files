    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION Lymphomas represent the fourth most frequent type of cancer, 90% of them arising from B cell lymphocytes. Despite their high prevalence, around 40% remain incurable because of refractoriness to current chemoimmunotherapy or disease relapse after obtaining response (Li et al., 2018; Meng et al., 2020). The cell of origin is a B lymphocyte with a unique B cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is an immunoglobulin composed of two heavy chains (IgH) and two light chains (IgL) whose genes have multiple coding segments that through rearrangement first and further somatic hypermutation in the germinal center, generate a unique sequence that could be used to monitor the treatment response (Seifert et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020). This project studies the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to characterize and monitor such IgH clonality. The use of liquid biopsy samples would provide a minimally invasive method to identify refractory or relapse-risk patients since all of them will have residual tumor cells after treatment. METHODS The sample size of the study was 53 patients with several types of B-cell lymphomas. The IgH gene of the tumor clone was characterized from DNA of tumor samples at diagnosis by NGS and Sanger. The monitoring of this clone was studied by NGS from DNA and circulating tumor nucleic acids (ctNAs) during and after receiving treatment and at different times after clinical response was stablished (CR or PR). Relapse samples were analyzed by NGS and Sanger. RESULTS Characterization of the tumor clone IgH rearrangement is achieved in 45 of the 53 patients with B-cell lymphoma included in the study. As shown in Figure 1, after the two different amplification PCRs results are similar. In contrast, after sequencing the results obtained by Sanger and NGS are very different. In NGS, thanks to the massive amplification prior to sequencing, it is identify the tumor clone in approximately 80% of the samples. It is shown that the effectiveness in characterization is dependent on the origin of the DNA sample, with fresh material samples being the optimal (Figure 1). In monitoring, samples of different origin are used as shown in Figure 2. About 50% of these samples are plasma ctNAs whose average efficiency in the detection of IgH gene rearrangement is 73.3%, with a clear positive correlation between the sensitivity and the toal volume of plasma processed more starting plasma used (2 mL efficiency of 84.09%). Monitoring makes it possible to classify patients into three different groups (Figure 3): patients with complete remission, patients refractory to the different lines of treatment and patients with apparent complete response and subsequent relapse. In patients with complete response, the tumor clone decreases during treatment and at the end of the line it is no longer detectable, nor in subsequent follow-up samples. With respect to refractory patients, it is observed that the tumor clone remains present despite subsequent lines of treatment. Finally, in patients achieving CR with subsequent relapse, the clone can be detected in a small percentage at the end of the treatment schedule and remains present until relapse. A section of patients under treatment is also shown (Figure 3) to demonstrate the application of the study to clinical practice. Two patients with apparent complete response, one of them in complete remission and the other with a high risk of relapse, requiring a more exhaustive follow-up. The monitoring results obtained by flow cytometry are shown being these, in general, concordant. In some cases NGS shows greater sensitivity. CONCLUSION The use of NGS and liquid biopsy samples provides a minimally invasive method to monitor the IgH gene rearrangement of the tumor clone of patients with B-cell lymphomas. In our experience,, patients in remission can be clearly differentiated from those who are refractory or at risk of relapse. facilitating their treatment strategy and clinical decision making.
