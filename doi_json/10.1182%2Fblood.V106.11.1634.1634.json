    "abstract_text": "Background . Protein Z (PZ) is a vitamin-K dependent protein that serves as cofactor for PZ-dependent protease inhibitor, inactivating factor Xa. Therefore, deficiency of PZ could led to a prothrombotic phenotype. Contrasting data are available on the relationship between PZ and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Patients and Methods . We carried out a case-control study on 443 patients with deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs and/or pulmonary embolism who discontinued oral anticoagulant therapy and 394 controls, similar for age and sex. PZ was measured with an enzyme immuno-assay (Diagnostica Stago, France). A thrombophilia screening including DNA testing for factor V Leiden and G20210A prothrombin mutation and measurements of plasma antithrombin, protein C, protein S, and homocysteine (fasting and post-methionine load) was performed. Pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, liver or renal disease were exclusion criteria. Results . 443 patients and 394 healthy controls who underwent thrombophilia screening were investigated. Median PZ levels (range) were 1.95 \u03bcg/mL (0.22\u20136.26 \u03bcg/mL) in patients and 1.79 \u03bcg/mL (0.25\u20137.82 \u03bcg/mL) in controls (p=0.07). The odds ratios (adjusted for age, sex and the presence of thrombophilia) for VTE in patients with PZ levels in the lowest quartile was 0.8 (95% CI 0.5\u20131.1), and remained statistically non significant considering PZ levels below the 10 th percentile. However, low PZ levels (lowest quartile) increased the risk of VTE associated with factor V Leiden (odds ratio 14.6, 95% CI 1.9\u2013113), prothrombin G20210A (odds ratio 3.2, 95% CI 1.0\u201310.3), and hyperhomocysteinemia (odds ratio 4.7, 95% CI 1.7\u201317.0). These interactions remained, apart for prothrombin G20210A, when PZ levels below the 10 th percentile were considered. Conclusion . Low PZ levels are not an independent risk factor for VTE, but may enhance the relative risk due to already established risk factors, particularly factor V Leiden.",
