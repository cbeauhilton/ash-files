    "abstract_text": "Introduction: ALK + anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) overexpress C/EBP\u03b2, as a consequence of NPM-ALK kinase activity. C/EBP\u03b2 is a leucine zipper transcription factor, which plays a major role in cellular differentiation, inflammation, proliferation and metabolism control. To determine the role of C/EBP\u03b2 in ALK + ALCL transformation, and to identify its downstream targets, a highly specific C/EBP\u03b2-shRNA was used to knockdown C/EBP\u03b2. The consequences of C/EBP\u03b2 gene-silencing were analyzed by gene expression profiling. Materials and Methods: Four ALK + ALCL cell lines, SUDHL-1, Kijk, Karpas 299 and SUP-M2 were transfected with lentivirus containing the C/EBP\u03b2 shRNA or the vector without shRNA in triplicates. Western Blot analysis and qRT-PCR were performed to quantify the knockdown effect. At day three after infection, RNA was extracted and used for Gene Chip expression analysis (Affymetrix). Using Anova software for statistical analysis, we identified genes, which were regulated in all four cell lines. The effect of C/EBP\u03b2 knockdown on proliferation, cell cycle, and viability was analyzed by MTT assay and FACS analysis. Results: In all four ALK + ALCL, efficient C/EBP\u03b2 knockdown resulted in profound growth retardation (up to 84%) compared to control cells after 6 days of infection, and a clear shift from the S phase to the G1 phase in the cell cycle was observed. To identify genes regulated by C/EBP\u03b2 in all four cell lines, we performed statistical analysis applying a false discovery rate of 20%, and accepted only genes with a >1,1 and <0,9 fold ratio. We identfied 435 genes regulated after C/EBP\u03b2 knockdown (117 upregulated, 318 downregulated). Classification of the differentially expressed genes into biological categories revealed overrepresentation of genes involved in the regulation of kinase activity, cell cycle and proliferation, lymphocyte differentiation, and metabolic processes. In particular, kinases involved in the regulation of JNK activity, which have been shown previously to be involved in proliferation of ALCL, were highly affected by C/EBP\u03b2 knockdown. Genomatix Bibliosphere Pathway Analysis revealed C/EBP\u03b2 to be connected to pathways involving cell cycle (RUNX3, CCNG1, CDKN2A), apoptosis (FAS, PTPRC, BCL2A1, BIRC3) and MAPK cascades (TRIB1 and several MAP3Ks). Several of the genes identified contain known C/EBP\u03b2 binding sites. Conclusions: C/EBP\u03b2 silencing induces growth arrest in ALK + ALCL, which correlates with differential expression of genes involved in cell cycle, apoptosis and differentiation. This study reveals C/EBP\u03b2 as a master transcription regulator of NPM-ALK induced cellular proliferation, and therefore, an ideal candidate for targeted therapeutic intervention."
