    "abstract_text": "Introduction: We sought to compare outcomes among patients with hematologic neoplasms diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in a multiethnic urban academic medical center. Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients with hematologic neoplasms diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 17th to June 8 th 2020 was conducted. Subjects included were censored at last point of contact. Variables collected included age, gender, race/ethnicity, hematologic diagnosis, cancer treatment status, baseline and follow-up COVID-19 testing, neutrophil count, and lymphocyte count at time of diagnosis. Associations between hematologic diagnosis, cancer treatment status, age, gender, race/ethnicity, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and overall survival (OS) were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method with logrank test. Results: A total of 102 subjects with hematologic neoplasms and COVID-19 infection treated in Montefiore Health system were identified (Table 1). Thirty-nine (38%) subjects were undergoing active treatment, including 17 (16%) receiving conventional chemotherapy agents, 12 (12%) targeted therapy, and 10 (10%) combination therapy. Of those subjects, twenty (50%) experienced delay or discontinuation of treatment due to COVID-19 infection. Four subjects (4%) showed persistent infection by PCR at median duration of 25.1 days after initial diagnosis. Ten subjects (9.8%) showed clearance of the virus by PCR with median time-to-clearance of 51.8 days. Of 9 subjects with serologic testing, 8 tested positive for COVID-19 IgG antibody at median time of 62 days after initial COVID-19 diagnosis. Forty-seven (47%) subjects expired as a result of COVID-19 disease at the time of analysis. Disease type, treatment status, race/ethnicity, age, and gender showed no significant association with mortality. Patients older than 70 had worse outcomes than the younger population (p = 0.0082). Median neutrophil and lymphocyte count at time of diagnosis was 4500 and 900, respectively. NLR greater than 9 was associated with worse survival when compared to NLR less than 9 (p=0.0067). Conclusions: COVID-19 infection has adverse effects on patients with hematological neoplasms. Subjects older than 70 years had a significantly worse prognosis. Notably, subjects actively being treated with chemotherapy did not have worse outcomes than those not being treated in our cohort, supporting the notion than active COVID-19 infection per se should not result in treatment delays. In addition, high NLR correlates with worsened survival, suggesting that this could be a potential prognostic factor for COVID-19 mortality in the hematologic neoplasms population.
