    "abstract_text": "Background: The replacement therapy with plasma-derived factor VIII (FVIII)/von Willebrand factor (VWF) concentrates is the first line treatment for the patients with type 3 von Willebrand disease (VWD). However, development of anti-VWF alloantibodies (inhibitor) is a major problem since the inhibitor neutralizes the VWF activity and may cause anaphylactic reactions. As an alternative treatment, the usage of FVIII concentrates has been reported but the mechanism of the hemostatic effects remains to be elucidated. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to address the role of FVIII in the hemostatic mechanism in the absence of VWF by in vitro and ex vivo analysis in the treatment for type 3 VWD with recombinant FVIII (rFVIII). Patient/Methods: The patient is a 55-year-old male with type 3 VWD. Blood samples were obtained before and 30 min after bolus administration. Rotating thromboelastometry (ROTEM) assay was performed to examine global interactions in hemostasis. To elucidate the effect on platelet activation, \u03b1-thrombin- and shear-induced platelet aggregation studies were performed. Further, \u03b1-thrombin-induced [Ca 2+ ] i rise was assessed using fura2-AM loaded platelets. Results and Implications: The patient underwent two surgical procedures of multiple teeth extractions successfully with minimal bleeding by bolus administration of rFVIII (50 IU/kg) before procedure and followed by continuous infusion at rate of 10 IU/kg/h for 15 hours. FVIII:C was elevated from 1.0% to 20~30% 30 min after bolus infusion and maintained ~15% after 12 h-continuous infusion. ROTEM analysis showed that infusion of rFVIII shortened clotting time (preinfusion 2083.8\u00b1784.3 sec vs. post-infusion 1022.0\u00b1191.5 sec) and clot formation time (pre 1267.3\u00b1455.4 sec vs. post 705.8\u00b1261.8 sec) and increased \u03b1 (pre 8.5\u00b17.4 degree vs. post 23.5\u00b14.4 degree). The \u03b1 value and CFT indicate the rate of increase of elastic shear modulus. Addition of rFVIII to preinfusion blood in vitro corrected ROTEM parameters and thrombin-induced aggregation dose-dependently. Infusion of FVIII enhanced thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (% maximal aggregation: pre 26.3% vs. post 98.2%) as well as low shear-induced platelet aggregation (% maximal aggregation: pre 18% vs. post 52%). Furthermore, infusion of rFVIII meliorated thrombin-induced intracellular calcium flux of washed platelets (thrombin 10 nM, Ca flux: pre 414.0 nM vs. post 620.6 nM). Recently, the cell-based model of hemostasis provides a solid foundation for the relation between platelet and coagulation. Although coagulation initiation occurs normally via the extrinsic pathway, amplification mediated by the intrinsic pathway is seriously disturbed in type 3 VWD due to the marked decrease in FVIII. Therefore, correction of FVIII could result in the improvement of hemostasis. Our data demonstrated the effectiveness of FVIII in the surgical treatment for type 3 VWD and further suggested that FVIII molecules are incorporated into platelet phospholipids to facilitate platelet activation as well as act directly to intrinsic pathways to normalize coagulation. Conclusions: Our observations suggested that FVIII plays an essential role in hemostasis in the absence of VWF and provided the rationale for the usage of rFVIII in the hemostatic management of type 3 VWD.",
