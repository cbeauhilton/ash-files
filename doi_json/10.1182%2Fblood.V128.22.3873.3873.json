    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), at the apex of the blood hierarchy, generate a series of increasingly committed progenitors and ultimately produce terminally differentiated cells at the bottom of the hierarchy. Although HSC and their immediate downstream, multipotent progenitors (MPP) have full multilineage differentiation capacity, only HSC have the capacity for long term self-renewal. Thus comparison of HSC with downstream progenitors that exhibit gradual fate restriction by assuming the identity of a mature blood cell is central to defining how the stemness state is established and how lineage commitment is executed. Interestingly, few genes are differentially expressed between human HSC and MPP, suggesting that some important stem cell mechanisms are in a permissive state and therefore difficult to identify simply by differential gene expression analysis. We hypothesized that these permissive genetic regions could be identified by chromatin analysis. To identify permissive genomic regions, we delineated regions of accessible chromatin through ATAC-seq assays in HSC, MPP, committed progenitors and seven mature lineages from human Cord Blood. DNA recognition motif analysis across accessible chromatin in each developmental stage identified both known and unknown candidate master regulatory transcription factors for each step of lineage development. The DNA recognition motif for CTCF, a crucial effector of chromatin interactions, is enriched in accessible chromatin associated with progenitors but not in HSC, even though CTCF expression is not significantly different among stem and progenitor populations. Knockdown of CTCF in HSC by lentiviral vector system increased the proportion of HSC in G0 cell cycle and consequently reduced the number of mature cells generated in both conventional and high sensitivity single cell assays. The development of differentiated lymphoid and megakaryocytic lineages was affected. Few effects were seen when CTCF was silenced in MPP or more downstream progenitors. Collectively, our results suggest that CTCF is a \"gate keeper factor\" that regulates transition from dormant to active stages in HSC, and might control stem cell pool throughout life. In parallel to normal blood hierarchies, AML is also composed of a hierarchy with leukemia stem cells and non-stem-like leukemia cells; LSC and non-LSC fractions sorted from 24 AML patients have also been subjected to ATAC-seq. Currently we are comparing HSC and non-HSC with LSC and non-LSC fractions to identify the similarity and differences between normal HSC and LSC. Overall, our study is revealing insights into the stemness state of normal and leukemic stem cells in primary human tissues. Disclosures Takayanagi: Kyowa Hakko Kirin: Employment.",
