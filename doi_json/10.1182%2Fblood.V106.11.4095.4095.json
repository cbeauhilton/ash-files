    "abstract_text": "Type III vWD is a rare disorder characterized by absent or <0.01u/ml of ristocetin cofactor (vW:RCoF), and a Factor (F) VIII:C of 0.03\u20130.10 u/ml. A total absence of FVIII:C has never been reported in type III vWD. We wish to report one such case where there was no measurable level of FVIII:C in a child leading to an initial diagnosis of severe haemophilia A. This patient presented at birth with post circumcision bleeding that was controlled with local measures. A packed RBC transfusion of 12 ml/kg body weight was given to correct acute blood loss. Coagulation studies performed before red cell transfusion revealed a FVIII:C of <0.01u/ml leading to diagnosis of severe haemophilia A. Patient required no further treatment to control bleeding. At 14 months of age the patient presented with an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). rAHF (KogenateFS\u00ae) in doses of 50 to 400 u/kg resulted in poor recovery, half-life of 88 minutes and an in vivo survival of less than 4 hours. There was no FVIII:C inhibitor but vWF:RCoF, vWF:Ag and vWF multimers were totally absent. vWF concentrate (Humate-P\u00ae) in doses of 50\u2013100/u/kg as vW:RCoF resulted in good clinical response, appropriate in vivo recovery and survival as shown in graphs below. This patient has made an excellent recovery and is fully functional 8 weeks after the ICH. Further enquiry into the family history revealed consanguinity with marriage between first cousins. A female cousin is also affected with easy bruising. Both parents have normal FVIII:C and borderline low vWF:RCoF. DNA analysis of the parents, propositus and unaffected siblings is in progress. Our case illustrates the importance of excluding Type III vWD at initial diagnosis even when the FVIII:C is <0.01u/ml instead of assuming it to be a severe haemophilia A.
