    "abstract_text": "It is unclear how a paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) clone expands and bone marrow failure (BMF) occurs in PNH patients, although an immunologic mechanism by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) has been suggested. It has been also reported that immunization with HLA-binding peptides of Wilms\u2019 tumor gene (WT1) in hematopoietic cells induces a WT1 peptide-specific CTL response, and WT1 RNA is highly expressed in BM mononuclear cells (MNCs) in PNH patients (Shichishima T et al., Blood, 2002). In this study, to clarify some roles of WT1 peptide-specific and HLA-restricted CTLs, the frequencies of peripheral blood (PB) WT1 peptide-specific and HLA-A * 2402-restricted CTLs by flow cytometric tetramer analysis and WT1 peptide-stimulated interferon (IFN)-\u03b3-producing MNCs by enzyme-linked immunospot assay in 5 PNH patients with the HLA-A * 2402 allele were examined. We also investigated cytotoxicity of WT1 peptide-specific and HLA-A * 2402-restricted CTL clone (TAK-1) cells on BM MNCs by 51 Cr-releasing assay, colony forming-unit granulocyte-macrophage colony formation of CD34 + CD59 + and CD34 + CD59 \u2212 cells, and CD59 expression in viable 7AAD \u2212 CD34 + cells by flow cytometry in those patients, and expression of IFN-\u03b3 in TAK-1 cells by flow cytometry, after co-incubation of BM cells from them with TAK-1 cells. As controls, 8 healthy volunteers (HV) with the HLA-A * 2402 allele and 2 PNH patients and HV without the allele were examined. We found that the frequencies of PB WT1 peptide-specific and HLA-A * 2402-restricted CD8 + cells ( p <0.005) and WT1 peptide-stimulated IFN-\u03b3-producing MNCs ( p <0.02) were significantly higher in PNH patients with the HLA-A * 2402 allele (0.255 \u00b1 0.164% and 25.2 \u00b1 15.4 / 5 x 10 5 cells, respectively) than HV with the allele (0.052 \u00b1 0.025% and 6.6 \u00b1 6.8 / 5 x 10 5 cells, respectively). In PNH patients or HV, TAK-1 cells significantly killed BM MNCs, suppressed colony formations of CD34 + CD59 + and CD34 + CD59 \u2212 cells, and expressed IFN-\u03b3 in the absence and presence of a WT1 peptide or only in the presence of the peptide, respectively, in an HLA-A * 2402-restricted manner. Reduction rates of colony formation of CD34 + CD59 \u2212 cells from the patients with the HLA-A * 2402 allele by TAK-1 cells were significantly less than those of CD34 + CD59 + cells in PNH patients, in the absence (38.3 \u00b1 23.0% and 59.0 \u00b1 28.0%, respectively, p <0.01) and presence (74.7 \u00b1 12.8% and 90.6 \u00b1 11.1%, respectively, p <0.002) of a WT1 peptide. After co-incubation of BM MNCs from the patients with TAK-1 cells, proportions of viable CD34 + CD59 \u2212 cells from PNH patients significantly increased in the absence (62.87 \u00b1 27.29%; p <0.01) and presence (62.32 \u00b1 25.73%; p <0.01) of a WT1 peptide compared with those of the controls incubated without TAK-1 cells (52.40 \u00b1 24.58%) in an HLA-A * 2402-restricted manner. In conclusion, WT1 peptide-specific and HLA-restricted CTLs may play important roles in the expansion of a PNH clone during immunologic selection and in the occurrence of BMF via IFN-\u03b3 in PNH.",
