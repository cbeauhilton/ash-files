    "abstract_text": "Dysfunction of TGF\u03b2 signal transduction has been shown to result in leukemogenesis. It has been generally accepted that Smads mediate the TGF\u03b2 signaling to inhibit cell proliferation, while several Smad4-impaired cell lines retain certain levels of responsiveness to TGF\u03b2, suggesting an additional TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway for cell cycle arrest. Here we demonstrate evidence for a novel signal pathway for G1 arrest linking TGF\u03b2 and p53/Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in CD4+ T lymphocyte and megakaryocytes. TGF\u03b2 induced growth suppression, associated with increment of PP2A activity was clearly observed in cells with impaired Smad signal. In these cells, upon TGF\u03b2 stimulation, PP2A was transiently recruited by heteromeric complex of TGF\u03b2 receptors (T\u03b2Rs), released into cytosol, and activated. Subsequently, PP2A dephosphorylated p53 to import it into nucleus by interacting with importin-\u03b1/\u03b2 followed by p21Waf1 induction. The recruitment of PP2A by T\u03b2Rs and TGF\u03b2-induced growth suppression as well as nuclear import of p53 were inhibited by introduction of siRNA for PP2A-B\u03b1. Based on these preliminary observation, we next used human peripheral CD4+ T lymphocytes, which are reportedly impaired in Smad signaling, but sensitive to TGF\u03b2 when stimulated with PHA and IL-2. Growth suppression induced by TGF\u03b2 was almost completely abolished by siRNA for p53 (siRNA-p53), but not by siRNA for Smad4 (siRNA-Smad4). Further, nuclear translocation of p53 was inhibited by siRNA for PP2A-B\u03b1(siRNA-B\u03b1). These results suggest that growth suppressive activity of TGF\u03b2 in certain immunological responses could be ascribed to PP2A/p53 signal transduction. Thus these results define a novel pathway of TGF\u03b2-induced growth suppression linking p53-PP2A, and suggest that loss of function of p53 which is frequently observed in hematological malignancies may result in the escape from growth inhibitory signal of TGF\u03b2."
