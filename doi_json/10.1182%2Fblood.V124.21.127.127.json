    "abstract_text": "Pathologic germ line mutations that predispose patients to cancer are estimated to occur in 4-30% of all pediatric oncology cases. In addition to leukemia specific familial predisposition syndromes, children with rare constitutional syndromes, heterogeneous dysmorphic syndromes, and multiple-cancer hereditary predisposition syndromes are all at an increased risk for hematologic malignancies. However, to date no genome-wide analysis has been done to define the range of germ line mutations that occur in pediatric patients with hematological malignancies. To determine the frequency of pediatric cancer patients that have germ line variants of pathological significance in genes that predisposed to cancer, we analyzed the germ line and tumor DNA from 1120 pediatric cancer patients that were enrolled in the St. Jude \u2013 Washington University Pediatric Cancer Genome Project (PCGP). Samples were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing (n\u2009=\u2009595), whole-exome sequencing (n\u2009=\u2009456), or both (n\u2009=\u200969). Single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions/deletions (indels), structural variations (SV) and copy number alterations (CNAs) were detected using our analytical pipeline and all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously identified in non-cancer populations were filtered out. Our analysis then focused on the 23 cancer predisposition genes recently recommended for germ line analysis by the American College of Genetics and Genomics, along with an additional 8 genes that have been previously shown to predispose to pediatric cancer at a high penetrance. All variants in these 31 genes were classified as pathologic, likely pathologic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign based on literature review and in-silico predictions on the effect of novel mutations. An expanded analysis including a total of 565 genes known to play a role in oncogenesis was also evaluated. Pathologic or likely pathologic germ line variants in one of the 31 genes were detected in 8% (90/1120) of patients, including: 16% (46/287) of patients with solid tumors, 8.6% (21/245) with brain tumors, and 3.9% (23/588) with leukemia. Expanding this analysis to 565 cancer gene resulted in only a slight increase, with a pathologic or likely pathologic variant being detected in 8.6% (97/1120) of patients. The most frequently effected genes included TP53 (n=48), APC (n=7) and BRCA2 (n=6). Importantly, in >50% of these patients, analysis of their tumor DNA revealed the absence of a wild type allele for the cancer predisposition gene that was altered in the germ line. The 588 pediatric patients with leukemia included 116 acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs: FAB M7 n=20; Core Binding Factor leukemias n=86; MLL- R n=10) and 472 acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs: E2A-PBX 1 n=53; ERG-R n=39; TEL-AML1 n=53; Hyperdiploid n=69; Hypodiploid n=47; BCR-ABL1 n=40; T-ALL n=32; MLL-R n=40; BCR-ABL -like n=31; and Other n=68). Across this cohort, 3.9% (23/588) of leukemia patients harbored a pathologic germ line mutations in one of the 31 cancer pre-disposing genes. This number increased to 4.6% (27/588; 28 mutations) when the expanded gene list was evaluated. TP53 (n=10) was the most frequently altered germ line gene in pediatric leukemia patients and was found predominantly in low-hypodiploid ALL, as previously reported. Germ line pathologic variants were also identified in KRAS , RUNX1 , APC , BRCA2 , and RET (2 cases each), and NRAS , SH2B3 , BRCA1 , MUTYH , PTCH1 , SDHA, VHL , and NF2 (1 case each). Although germ line mutations in RUNX1 and SH2B3 are typically associated with myeloid neoplasms, we identified these lesions in 3 cases of B lineage ALL suggesting an association with a wider spectrum of leukemia. In conclusion, a small but significant proportion of pediatric patients with leukemia carry a germ line variant of pathologic significance in a cancer predisposition gene. These results suggest that these germ line lesions likely play a direct role in the pathogenesis of the patient\u2019s presenting leukemia. Moreover, our results suggest that these patients would benefit from future clinical surveillance for the development of a second cancer. Lastly, these data demonstrate the power of comprehensive next generation DNA/RNA sequencing for the identification of pediatric patients who carry a germ line pathologic variant in a cancer predisposition gene.
