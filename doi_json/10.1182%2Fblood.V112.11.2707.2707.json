    "abstract_text": "Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) allows a comprehensive profiling of gene expression within a given tissue and also an assessment of transcript abundance. Objectives : We generated SAGE libraries from normal and neoplastic plasma cells to identify genes differentially expressed in multiple myeloma (MM). Material and Methods: Normal plasma cells were obtained from palatine tonsils and MM SAGE library was generated from bone marrow plasma cells of MM patients. Results: We obtained 29,918 SAGE tags from normal and 10,340 tags from tumor libraries. Computer-generated genomic analysis identified 46 upregulated genes in the MM library. Ten upregulated genes were selected for further investigation. Differential expression was validated by quantitative real-time PCR in purified plasma cells of 31 patients and three controls. P53CSV, DDX5, MAPKAPK2, RANBP2 were found to be upregulated in at least 50% of the MM cases tested. All of them were also found upregulated in MM when compared to normal plasma cells in a meta-analysis using ONCOMINE microarray database. Antibodies specific to DDX5, RANBP2 and MAPKAPK2 were used in a TMA containing 57 MM cases and confirmed the expression of these proteins in 74, 96, and 21% of the MM samples, respectively. Conclusions: Analysis of differential expression using SAGE could identify new genes important for myeloma tumorigenesis ( P53CSV , DDX5 , MAPKPK2 and RANBP2 ) and that could potentially be useful as therapeutic targets."
