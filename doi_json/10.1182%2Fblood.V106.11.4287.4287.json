    "abstract_text": "Hematopoiesis involves highly regulated proliferation and differentiation during which a small number of multipotent stem cells give rise to differentiated progenies. In several developmental systems stem cells fate is influenced by soluble molecules acting via cell-cell interaction, including those mediate by the Notch receptor family. Members of Notch family transmembrane receptors are found on primitive hematopoietic precursors, suggesting a role for Notch signaling in mammalian blood cells development. Notch signaling regulates cell fate controlling asymmetric cell division during stem/progenitor cell differentiation. A previous study on K562 cell line showed that Notch signaling inhibits erythroid/megakaryocytic development by suppressing GATA-1 activity. Furthermore there are evidences that Notch is expressed in early murine erythroid precursors. Probably Notch signaling in these uncommittted precursors may lead to enhanced survival, preserving multilineage potential. The role of Notch pathway during human adult erytropiesis has not been described. The aim of this study is to investigate the modulation of Notch activity during \u201cin vitro\u201d human erythropiesis. Human CD34 + from perpheral blood of normal adult subjects were differentiate \u201c in vitro\u201d for two weeks by the addiction of IL-3, SCF and Epo. This method of colture reproduces all stages of adult erythropoiesis. We analized the modulation of the expression of Notch-1, of its effector Hes-1 and of several erythoid specific genes, at different stages of differentiation using real time PCR. Our analysis shows that Hes-1 expression, which indicates the activation of Notch-1 pathway, is very high in the early steps of differentiation (BFU-E, CFU-E) while in the late stages rapidly decreases to undetectable levels. The Notch-1 gene expression doesn\u2019t seem to be modulated way, but we didn\u2019t invstigate the protein levels yet. These data suggest that Notch pathway is involved in the early stages of erythroid differentiation where it may enhance erythroid progenitors survival up to CFU-E, as hypothisized in mouse model, preventing them from apoptotic stimuli and promoting their proliferation. Involvement of Notch-1 signaling in preventing erythroid progenitors from apoptosis during erythroid differentiation could be important in some erythropoietic disorders such as b-Thalassemia syndromes or diserythropoietic anemias.",
