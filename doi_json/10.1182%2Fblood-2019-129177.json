    "abstract_text": "Introduction Multiple myeloma (MM) bone disease is characterized by the development of osteolytic bone lesions due to the over-activation of osteoclast and inhibition of osteoblast cells. MM cells secret pro-osteoclastogenic factors which lead to osteoclast (OCL) activation. Our previous work demonstrated that matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) is a critical osteoclastogenic factor which is highly secreted by MM cells. MMP-13 induces osteoclast fusion and bone-resorption by triggering the ERK1/2-dependent up-regulation of the cell fusogen, DC-STAMP. This process operates independently of the MMP-13 proteolytic activity. The fact that MMP-13 regulates OCL signaling via a proteolytic independent mechanism suggests that MMP-13 functions as a paracrine message protein mediating the crosstalk between MM cells and OCL. However, the mechanism is yet to be identified. Methods and Results To screen for MMP-13 cellular binding proteins/receptors, we performed a MMP-13 pull-down assay wherein recombinant MMP-13-His 6 was incubated with mouse mononuclear bone marrow cells (BMCs) lysates and Ni-NTA magnetic beads were used to pull-down MMP-13- associated proteins. Following mass spectral analysis, programmed death-1 homolog (PD-1H) was identified as a major MMP-13-binding protein. PD-1H, also known as V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA), is a critical negative checkpoint regulator expressed on myeloid cells and involved in immune responses. Binding of MMP-13 and PD-1H was confirmed by co-expressing both proteins in HEK293 cells and subsequent co-immunoprecipitation assay. Further, following PD-1H expression in HEK293 cells, an MMP-13-GFP fusion fluorescence protein docked to the cell surface where mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the PD-1H extracellular domain (ECD) mediates the specific binding interaction. Western blot and immunohistochemistry revealed that PD-1H was highly expressed in mononuclear BMCs, pre-OCL and mature OCL. ShRNA-mediated knockdown of PD-1H in mouse mononuclear BMCs blocked the ability of MMP-13 to induce osteoclast fusion and activation. These results were further confirmed by using BMCs from Pd-1h -/- mice and WT littermates for in vitro osteoclast differentiation. While MMP-13 induced WT OCL fusion and activation, these effects were completely blocked in Pd-1h -/- OCLs in tandem with a loss in MMP-13 induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, NFATc1 and DC-STAMP upregulation. Conclusions Taken together, our study, for the first time, revealed that checkpoint inhibitor PD-1H is highly expressed in pre- and mature osteoclast. More importantly, we identified PD-1H as the critical receptor for MMP-13 in OCL, thereby mediating MMP-13-induced OCL fusion, activation and bone resorption. Hence, MMP-13 as a novel PD-1H ligand might not only induce bone disease, but also play a potential role in the regulation of T-cell activity in MM. As such, targeting MMP-13 and PD-1H interactions may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to treat MM bone disease and modulate the MM immune environment.
