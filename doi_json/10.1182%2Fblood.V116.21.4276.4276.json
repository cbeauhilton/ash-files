    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4276 Background: To date, the efficacy of various iron chelators in reducing cardiac iron, a leading cause of death in transfused patients with \u03b2-thalassemia major (TM), has been demonstrated in prospective controlled studies of up to 1-yr duration. Since removal of iron from the heart takes several years, it is important to assess longer-term effects of iron chelation therapy in terms of cardiac iron removal. We report here end-of-study (EOS) results from the EPIC cardiac substudy in TM patients treated with deferasirox for up to 3 yrs. Methods: Patients aged \u226510 yrs with myocardial T2* >5 to 2500 ng/mL, MR (R2) liver iron concentration (LIC) >10 mg Fe/g dry weight (dw) and \u226550 lifetime transfused blood units were included in the study. Deferasirox was initiated at 30 mg/kg/day and increased to 40 mg/kg/day by the start of yr 2. Dose decreases were allowed for safety reasons. Primary endpoint was change in myocardial T2* from baseline (BL) to 3 yrs. Results: Seventy-one patients completed 2 yrs of treatment and entered the 3 rd yr of the study. Mean age was 20.5 \u00b1 7.4 yrs. BL cardiac T2* was >5 to <10 ms (severe cardiac siderosis) in 24 patients (34%) and 10 to <20 ms (moderate-to-mild cardiac siderosis) in 47 patients (66%). All patients were previously chelated with deferoxamine (DFO) or DFO and deferiprone. Mean actual deferasirox dose was 33.3 \u00b1 3.9, 35.4 \u00b1 8.0 and 33.6 \u00b1 9.8 mg/kg/day during the 1 st , 2 nd and 3 rd yr, respectively. Geometric mean T2* significantly increased from 11.9 ms \u00b1 39.0% at BL to 13.9 ms \u00b1 46.9% after 1 yr, 15.6 ms \u00b1 57.7% after 2 yrs, and continued to increase to 17.1 ms \u00b1 62.0% after 3 yrs, (increase from BL of 17% at 1 yr, 31% at 2 yrs and 44% at 3 yrs; P 5 to <10 ms also showed significant increases; geometric mean T2* reached near moderate-to-mild severity (9.4 ms \u00b1 31.5%) by 2 yrs and continued to increase to 10.5 ms \u00b1 42.5% at EOS (22% and 36% increase from BL, respectively).

Mean LIC significantly reduced from 28.4 \u00b1 9.7 mg Fe/g dw at BL to 15.5 \u00b1 14.1 mg Fe/g dw at EOS (\u201347%; P <0.001). Median serum ferritin also significantly reduced from 5575 ng/mL at BL to 2794 ng/mL at EOS (\u201346%; P <0.001). Of 71 patients, 66 (93.0%) completed the 3 rd yr. Reasons for discontinuation were unsatisfactory therapeutic effect (n=3) and consent withdrawal (n=2). There were no deaths during the 3-yr study. Drug-related AEs (\u22655%) decreased year by year: increased blood creatinine (n=19 [26.8%] vs n=16 [22.5%] vs n=9 [12.7%]), rash (n=11 [15.5%] vs n=0 vs n=0), increased ALT (n=5 [7.0%] vs n=3 [4.2%] vs n=2 [2.8%]), increased AST (n=4 [5.6%] vs n=3 [4.2%] vs n=1 [1.4%]) and diarrhea (n=4 [5.6%] vs n=1 [1.4%] vs n=0). In yr 3, serious AEs included atrial fibrillation, chronic sinusitis, femur fracture, gastritis, muscle abscess and rheumatic fever (all n=1); none were considered deferasirox-related. Six patients (8.5%) had 2 consecutive increases in serum creatinine >33% above BL and upper limit of normal (ULN); 3 patients in the 1 st yr and 3 in the 3 rd yr. Two (2.8%) patients had 2 consecutive increases in ALT >10 \u00d7 ULN; 1 patient in the 2 nd yr and 1 patient in both the 2 nd and 3 rd yr. Conclusion: This is the first prospective study to report 3-yr data on cardiac iron removal for an iron chelator. Once-daily deferasirox monotherapy at doses of 30\u201340 mg/kg/day effectively removed cardiac iron, allowing 68% of patients with moderate-to-mild cardiac iron loading to normalize and 50% of patients with severe myocardial iron loading at BL to reduce their cardiac iron levels to the moderate-to-mild range, associated with a much lower risk of heart failure. Importantly, there were no reports of death during the study. The long-term improvements in cardiac iron loading with deferasirox at doses of >30 mg/kg/day were associated with a manageable safety profile, maintenance of normal cardiac function and a concomitant significant decrease in hepatic and total body iron burden by nearly 50% over the 3 yrs.
