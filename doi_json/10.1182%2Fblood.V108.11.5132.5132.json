    "abstract_text": "Analysis of T cell receptor (TCR) V\u03b1 and V\u03b2 repertoire is one of the sensitive methods to understand the distribution and clonality of T cells from different samples, which is used to identify clonal expansion T cells that response to tumor associated antigens. Cord blood has been used successfully as a source of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation. Recently, stem cells transplantation was demonstrated more important as immunotherapy against malignance cells. And cord blood T cells are resourceful for production the specific CTL to use in leukemia immunotherapy. But the feature of distribution and clonality of TCR V\u03b1 and V\u03b2 subfamily T cells in cord blood is not yet clearly defined. In the present study, the CDR3 of 29 TCR V\u03b1 and 24 V\u03b2 subfamily genes were analyzed in T cells from 10 cases of cord blood, which obtained at delivery from full-term healthy pregnancies, using RT-PCR and genescan technique. Peripheral blood of nine cases healthy adult volunteers served as controls. The results showed that 15\u201319 of 29 V\u03b1 and 9\u201315 of V\u03b2 subfamily T cells could be identified in the most cases, whereas only 2\u20134 of V\u03b1 subfamilies expressed was found in 3 cases. The most frequently expressed V\u03b1 subfamilies were V\u03b1 3 and V\u03b1 10 (100%), V\u03b1 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 15, 17 and V\u03b1 21 (70%), V\u03b11, 13, 25, and V\u03b126 (60%), with a lower expression rate found in V\u03b116, 24 and V\u03b1 28 (10%). V\u03b1 9 and V\u03b1 29 were not detected in both CB and healthy adults. In analysis of TCR V\u03b2 repertoire, V\u03b23, 5, 8 and V\u03b29 genes could be identified in all samples, V\u03b27 and V\u03b213 could be found in 90% of samples, whereas V\u03b24, 6, 11, 12, 18, 23 and V\u03b224 were absent in all samples, which could be detected in normal peripheral blood samples. Genescan analysis showed that all PCR products of TCR V\u03b1 and V\u03b2 subfamilies from cord blood displayed a Gaussian distribution of CDR3 lengths (multi-peaks), which are corresponding to polyclonal rearrangement pattern, except for tow cases, which displayed oligoclonal peak in V\u03b1 24 or V\u03b128 respectively. In contrast, some V\u03b1 subfamily products from 8 of 9 cases of healthy adult volunteers contained at least an oligoclonal peak in different V\u03b1 subfamilies respectively, however, multi-peaks were found in all PCR products of TCR V\u03b2 from normal peripheral blood. In conclusion, more than 20% of TCR V\u03b1 or V\u03b2 subfamily T cells were absent in cord blood. The majority of TCR V\u03b1 and V\u03b2 subfamily T cells in cord blood displayed polyclonality. Occasional oligoclonal peaks are identified in some cases."
