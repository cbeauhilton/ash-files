    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma is a disease that typically responds to initial treatment; however, the disease is not cured by chemotherapy, and drug resistance ultimately develops. Most studies investigating the problem of drug resistance have focused on acquired resistance or resistance that occurs after response to prior therapy as a result of residual disease. Intrinsic factors, such as reduced drug uptake, enhanced damage response (i.e., DNA repair), altered drug metabolism, or inhibition of programmed cell death pathways are known to contribute to acquired drug resistance. For example, it was recently reported that the acquired melphalan resistant phenotype in myeloma cell lines was associated with over-expression of the Fanconi anemia (FA)/BRCA pathway genes. Enhanced interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair via the FA/BRCA pathway was causally related to melphalan resistance and disruption of this pathway using knock-down techniques reversed drug resistance. Furthermore, bortezomib (Velcade) has been reported to enhance melphalan treatment, and recent pre-clinical data has shown that bortezomib reduces FA/BRCA gene expression and function. Clinical trials are necessary to determine the role of the FA/ BRCA pathway in acquired drug resistance for myeloma patients and whether targeting this pathway enables prevention of or the ability to overcome acquired melphalan resistance in myeloma patients. Conversely, factors that promote tumor cell survival and drug resistance that are external to the tumor cell itself might exist. Evidence supporting the importance of understanding the influence of the tumor microenvironment on drug sensitivity has been reported by several investigators. The tumor microenvironment for hematologic malignancies, including myeloma, is principally the bone marrow. The bone marrow contains candidate components that contribute to reduced drug activity, minimal residual disease, and emergence of drug resistant cells. Cell adhesion molecules expressed by myeloma cells, including the \u03b2 integrins, bind to fibronectin and other extracellular matrix components of the bone marrow, and this interaction contributes to a reversible, de novo drug resistance phenotype called \u201ccell adhesion mediated drug resistance\u201d or CAMDR. Adhesion via integrins is known to activate a network of signal transduction pathways that influence cell survival, growth, and differentiation. Several targets that are influenced by integrin adhesion and may contribute to CAM-DR include the following: reduced proapoptotic Bim levels, alterations in nuclear topoisomerase II levels, increased p27 kip1 levels, and changes in FLIP1 levels. In addition, myeloma cell adhesion to bone marrow stroma (BMS) involves other adhesion molecules and signaling events that promote CAMDR. For example, Notch1 receptors expressed on multiple myeloma cells when stimulated by Jagged causes growth arrest and protection from drug-induced apoptosis. Recently, approaches to inhibit integrin and Notch signaling associated with CAM-DR have been examined pre-clinically. Clinical trials are necessary to determine if these approaches will prevent or overcome CAM-DR in patients."
