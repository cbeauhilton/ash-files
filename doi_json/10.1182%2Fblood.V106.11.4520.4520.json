    "abstract_text": "The t(12;13)(p11-13:q11-14) is a recurring chromosomal abnormality found in different types of hematological malignancies. Three genes on 13q12-14, CDX2 , FLT3 , and TTL have been identified as fusion partners of ETV6 ( TEL ) on 12p13. These genes create different forms of fusion transcripts with ETV6 . In the present study, we identified novel types of ETV6-TTL fusion transcripts in a case of a 9 year-old female who developed myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukemia with t(12;13)(p13;q14). Cytogenetic analyses of the leukemic cells of the patient using a regular G-banding revealed 47, XX, del(2)(q?), -9, der(12)t(12;13)(p13;q14), add(13)(q1?2), +mar1, +mar2 [13/20]. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using YAC clone revealed that ETV6 gene was split in metaphase chromosomes of patient\u2019s leukemic cells. We performed reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis to detect the fusion transcripts of ETV6-CDX2 , ETV6-FLT3 or TTL-ETV6 , however, no fusion transcripts of previously described types were detected. We next performed RT-PCR analysis using various sets of primers to detect unknown types of fusion transcripts involving these genes, and detected novel types of fusion transcripts of ETV6-TTL . These fusion transcripts consisted of exons 1 to 5 of ETV6 and exons 5 to 8 of TTL , and exons 1 to 6 of ETV6 and exon 9 or exons 8 to 9 of TTL . No reciprocal fusion transcripts were detected. Predicted fusion proteins consisted of N-terminal ETV6 lacking whole or part of ETS-binding domain and C-terminal TTL. Previous report showed major type of TTL-ETV6 fusion transcript consisted of exons 1 to 5 of TTL and exons 2 to 8 of ETV6 which contained both helix-loop-helix and ETS-binding domains. These results suggested that novel types of ETV6-TTL act as different fusion proteins from previously reported TTL-ETV6 in leukemogenesis. At the cytogenetic level, it may be difficult to distinguish ETV6-CDX2 , ETV6-FLT3 , and ETV6-TTL . Further accumulation of the patients with t(12;13) and further analysis of these novel types of fusion transcripts may clarify the pathogenesis of t(12;13)-leukemia.",
