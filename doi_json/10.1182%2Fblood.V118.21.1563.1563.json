However, BEACOPP achieves a higher disease control at a cost of a definitely higher toxicity. Positron emission tomography (PET) after two chemotherapy cycles (PET2) is the most reliable predictor of treatment outcome in ABVD-treated patients. A PET-2 response-adapted strategy with a therapy shift from ABVD to BEACOPP in PET2 positive patients (A/B-T) was shown to increase the 2-y Failure Free Survival (FFS) in the latter from 12% to 62% by indirect retrospective comparison, and to improve the disease control in the overall patient population (Gallamini Br. J. Haematol 2011). However, PET is an expensive test which deserves a careful economic assessment before widespread adoption and reimbursement. Methods: We built a Markov decision model comparing A/B-T with AT strategies for advanced HL. The model was calibrated on the reported retrospective cohort of 154 ABVD-treated HL patients in which treatment intensification with BEACOPP was given in PET-2 positive patients. Briefly, patients were treated with standard ABVD \u00d7 2 courses and an interim-PET performed afterwards: PET-2 negative patients continued with ABVD \u00d7 4 and consolidation RxT in presence of bulky disease; PET-2 positive patients shifted to BEACOPP escalated \u00d7 4 + BEACOPP baseline \u00d7 4. Patients failing either AT or A/B-T underwent rescue treatment with IGEV \u00d7 4, followed by Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT). In patients failing ASCT, DHAP reinduction therapy was given and allogeneic SCT (alloSCT) was performed whenever possible. The model included 12 health-states: ABVD cycles 1\u20132, ABVD cycles 3\u20136, BEACOPP escalated (4 cycles), BEACOPP baseline (4 cycles), IGEV (4 cycles), ASCT, DHAP + allogeneic SCT, follow-up (FFS patients PET2 negative), follow-up (FFS patients PET2 positive), follow-up (FFS after ASCT/CST), relapse, death. Each health state last 1 month and the overall time horizon at baseline was 5 years. We considered severe toxicity needing inpatient care and transplant-related mortality. Quality of life was reduced by 20% for chemotherapy-treated patients, 30% for transplanted ones and 40% in relapsed ones. The model assessed the following endpoints: survival, quality of life \u2013 adjusted survival (QALY) and costs (in the perspective of the health-care system) as the principal end-points. TreeAge SW (2008) was run. National charges were used as estimators of unitary costs. First and second-order sensitivity analysis was performed. Results: A/B-T reduced the overall percentage of patients failing treatment (refractory and relapsing) from 27% to 14%. This clinical advantage induced a prolongation of quality-adjusted survival from 53.20 to 55.63 quality-adjusted months, that is a gain of 0.18 QALYs (90% CI: \u22120.1;+1.4). The number of interim PET needed to avoid one ASCT was 8.3. The cost of universal interim PET (\u20ac1,546) was offset by the reduced number of ASCT procedures (\u20ac36,575). Consequently, health-care costs were \u20ac27,861 for A/BT versus \u20ac29,050 for AT strategy which is a \u20ac1189 (90%CI: \u221241,208; +13,240) saving. At sensitivity analysis we verified that the results were mildly sensitive to the costs of PET and ASCT: A/B-T was not cost saving if PET would cost more than \u20ac3,031 and ASCT less than \u20ac20,200. A/B-T would cost more than \u20ac40,000/QALY only at a PET cost higher than \u20ac16,300. The results were also sensitive to the portion of PET2 positive patients: A/B-T wouldn't turn out cost saving if the portion was higher than 22%. The results were not sensitive to the rate of severe adverse events during chemotherapy. The results were overall robust, since A/B-T cost less than \u20ac30,000/QALY in more than 80% out of 100,000 simulations (MonteCarlo analysis). Conclusions: A/B-T is more efficacious and less expensive than standard AT treatment for advanced-stage HL patients, therefore the routine use of interim-PET is warranted in treatment planning and chemosensitivity adapting in these patients. Disclosures: Off Label Use: The study includes use of Rituximab as maintenance in responding patients after first line chemoimmunotherapy.",
