    "abstract_text": "Tissue factor (TF) is a cellular receptor for the clotting protease factor VIIa (FVIIa), and TF-FVIIa complex initiates activation of the coagulation cascade. TF-FVIIa also influences non-hemostatic functions via direct or indirect cell signaling. Constitutive expression of TF is primarily restricted to the surface of perivascular cells, sequestered from circulating blood clotting factors, to prevent aberrant intravascular clotting. It has been suggested that TF is also present in the blood associated with microvesicles (MVs). These circulating TF, however, do not induce any thrombotic complications as they are either cleared from the system before they could accumulate to a pathological level or lack procoagulant activity. However, various pathological conditions such as sepsis, diabetes, bacterial infection, atherosclerosis, and cancer can increase the levels of circulating TF + MVs, which can then trigger intravascular coagulation and inflammation. We hypothesized that oxidative stress, a pathological condition, central to most of the diseases mentioned above, plays a role in the generation of TF + MVs in vivo, which could contribute to intravascular coagulation and inflammation. We recently showed that 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), the most abundant and stable unsaturated aldehyde produced by the oxidation of \u03c9-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, enhances TF activity in monocytic cells and macrophages. However, the role of HNE in activation of intravascular coagulation is unknown. To investigate this, C57Bl/6J wild-type mice were administered with HNE intraperitoneally (10 mg/kg body weight) and generation of TF + MVs, activation of intravascular coagulation, and inflammation was assessed. HNE administration markedly increased TF activity associated with MVs. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) showed a 3-fold increase in the number of MVs in the plasma of HNE-treated mice. Measurement of thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes revealed a significant increase in TAT levels in HNE treated mice. Pre-treatment of the mice with anti-murine TF antibody attenuated the HNE-induced increase in TAT levels. Measurement of plasma clotting times showed a significant reduction in HNE treated mice (118.3 \u00b1 10.42 sec) compared to saline treated control mice (> 300 sec). Incubation of plasma with anti-TF antibody reversed the reduction observed in the plasma clotting time of HNE treated mice. Assessment of clotting in the saphenous vein injury bleeding model showed an increased number of clots, and reduced blood loss in HNE-administered mice compared to saline treated mice. Blockade of TF with 1H1 anti-TF antibody negated the HNE-mediated reduction in the clotting time. Next, we investigated whether HNE administration also induces a proinflammatory response in mice. Blood cells analysis showed approximately a 4-fold increase in circulating neutrophils in HNE-treated mice at 6 h following HNE treatment. Immunohistochemistry studies showed a robust infiltration of neutrophils into the lungs. Cytokine analysis of plasma showed a significant increase in IL-6 and CXCL1 levels in HNE-treated mice. Blockade of TF using 1H1 anti-TF antibody significantly reduced the HNE-mediated neutrophil infiltration into the lungs and completely abrogated the increase in plasma IL-6 levels. In additional studies, we attempted to identify the source of TF + MVs. It is unlikely that they are originated from monocytes or endothelial cells as HNE did not induce TF expression in these cell types. LPS, used as a positive control, showed significant induction of TF on both PBMCs and the endothelium Immunohistochemistry revealed that HNE disrupted endothelial barrier integrity of vessel wall, raising a possibility that TF + MVs could have come from perivascular cells. In summary, our data indicate that oxidative stress could induce the release of TF + MVs, and this would contribute to intravascular coagulation and inflammation. Our studies also suggest that TF-positive microvesicles can be a useful therapeutic target in the treatment of thromboinflammatory diseases.
