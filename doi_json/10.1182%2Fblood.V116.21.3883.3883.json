    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3883 Background: Hodgkin's disease (HD) is the most common non-AIDS defining tumour diagnosed in HIV setting. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has opened a new prospective in the treatment of pts with HD-HIV as the better control of the underlying HIV infection allows the use of more aggressive chemotherapy regimens, including high dose chemotherapy. However, up to now prognostic factors on overall survival (OS) or time to treatment failure (TTF) have not been identified yet. Methods: in order to identify prognostic factors, we analyze data on 596 pts with HD-HIV diagnosed and treated in 90 different Institution from 6 European countries from October 1983 to March 2010. All factors were analyzed for OS and TTF. Results: 86% of pts were male and the median CD4 cell count was 224/mL (range 3\u20131274); 52% of pts had mixed cellularity subtype, stages III-IV were diagnosed in 72% of cases and 55% of pts had extranodal involvement (bone marrow 35%, spleen 21%, liver 14%). Table 1 summarizes the results of multivariate analysis.  Factors . Overall Survival HR (95%CI) . Time to Treatment Failure HR (95%CI) .

This score should be considered for future prospective studies. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
