    "abstract_text": "Abstract 708 Aberrantly activated tyrosine kinases and their associated signaling pathways are critical to leukemogenesis and primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell viability. While aberrant kinase activation has been confirmed in a significant percentage of AML, constitutive phosphorylation of STAT5, a marker of tyrosine kinase activation, is present in the majority of AML samples indicating that as yet unidentified tyrosine kinases can be aberrantly activated and contribute to leukemogenesis. Efforts to identify activating tyrosine kinase mutations using high-throughput sequencing have identified low frequency mutations of uncertain functional significance. Because these studies failed to detect additional high-frequency kinase mutations, the identity and mechanism of tyrosine kinase activation may be unique in many AMLs. To avoid the imitations of high-throughput sequencing, we have developed a functional assay that can rapidly and simultaneously identify therapeutic targets while providing therapeutic options. Methods: To rapidly identify activated kinase pathways in individual, primary AML samples, we have developed a small-molecule inhibitor array which includes 90 small-molecule, cell-permeable inhibitor compounds including a core of 36 tyrosine kinase inhibitors that covers the majority of the tyrosine kinome. Many of the inhibitors are available for clinical use or are in clinical development. In this assay, inhibitors were placed in 96-well plates at four serial dilutions to allow IC 50 calculations. Three days after adding primary AML cells to each well, we performed an MTS cell viability assay to evaluate the effect of each inhibitor on cell viability. Because most inhibitors affect multiple kinases, we compared target specificities of compounds that decrease primary AML cell viability with those that have no effect to identify potential targets. Results: In preliminary proof-of-principal experiments, we tested leukemia cell lines with known activating tyrosine kinase mutations and Ba/F3 cell lines expressing activated tyrosine kinases. Appropriate inhibitor sensitivity profiles were obtained in CMK cells which depend on a JAK3 A572V mutation for viability, MKPL-1 cells with an activating CSF1R translocation, and in a Ba/F3 line expressing JAK2 V617F. In addition to the primary target, downstream targets were frequently identified; MKPL-1 cells also showed sensitivity to phosphoinositol 3-kinase and NFKB inhibitors. Thus, not only primary targets but the downstream signaling pathways critical to leukemic cell viability can be highlighted using this assay. To date, we have analyzed approximately 150 primary leukemia and lymphoma samples. In some cases, targets could be identified by comparison of overlapping kinase specificities for compounds that decreased leukemic cell viability and subtraction of possible kinase targets inhibited by compounds that had no effect on viability. However, many cases exhibited complex, often unique, inhibitor sensitivity profiles that complicated target identification. Comparison with sensitivity profiles for known aberrantly activated kinases was useful when available. Accordingly, additional leukemia cell lines and Ba/F3 lines that depend on a single aberrantly activated tyrosine kinase for viability are being evaluated. Automated scripts that correlate the leukemic cell inhibitor sensitivity with the inhibitor target specificity are also in preparation. Conclusions: These preliminary data demonstrate that the small-molecule inhibitor functional assays can rapidly identify disease causing genes, provide insights into their mechanism of action, and suggest therapeutic options. The distinct patterns of tyrosine kinase sensitivity in these samples support the hypothesis that tyrosine kinases and related pathways contributing to leukemogenesis in each patient may be different and that targeted therapy will be most effective when administered on an individualized basis.
