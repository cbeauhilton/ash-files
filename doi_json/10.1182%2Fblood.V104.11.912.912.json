    "abstract_text": "In a number of studies on Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (HL), autologous transplantation of peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells (autoPBSCT) was proved to result in faster hematopoietic recovery compared to bone marrow transplantation (autoBMT), however, no difference regarding long-term outcome has been demonstrated so far. In Katowice transplant centre we developed a new method of autoBMT with bone morrow not-cryopreserved but stored for 3 days in 4 0 C and reinfused 24 hours after completion of CBV conditioning. In this study we analyzed outcome of 40 HL patients treated with this method in comparison with 125 patients given autoPBSCT between 1993\u20132004. In this setting patients were treated with CBV (n=32), BEAM+/\u2212 procarbazine (n=63) or other preparative regimens (n=30). In the autoBMT group patients were transplanted in high-risk CR1 (achieved after >1 line of therapy) (25%), CR>=2 (22.5%), PR1 (35%), PR>=2 (5%), and primary or secondary refractoriness (12.5%). The indications for autoPBSCT were comparable. As well, both groups did not differ in terms of age, histological subtype, disease stage at diagnosis, organ involvement or preceding therapy. At six years, the overall- and progression-free survival for autoBMT and autoPBSCT group equaled 88% vs. 72% (p=0.1) and 69% vs. 54% (p=0.08), respectively. The relapse incidence was significantly lower for patients given autoBMT compared with autoPBSCT (23% vs. 41%, p=0.03). In a univariate analysis, among other analyzed factors (age, disease stage at diagnosis and at transplantation, organ involvement, histological subtype, conditioning regimen, preceding therapy), the only factor influencing the risk of relapse was disease status at transplantation (CR or PR vs. NR - 32% vs. 62%, p=0.001). In a multivariate analysis the impact of both disease status (p=0.001) and the source of stem cells (p=0.04) remained statistically significant. The 100 days incidence of non-relapse mortality equaled 2.5% for autoBMT and 1% for autoPBSCT (p=NS). The neutrophil >0.5 G/L recovery was faster in the autoPBSCT group compared with autoBMT (14.7 vs. 17 d., p=0.006) whereas the difference regarding platelet >50 G/L recovery was not significant (17.5 vs. 19 d., p=NS). Both procedures did not differ in terms of severe adverse events as well as the need for blood products substitution, iv antibiotic therapy, cytokine tharapy or the time of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: AutoBMT without cryopreservation results in lower relapse rate in high-risk HL patients compared with autoPBSCT. Although the neutrophil recovery is longer by 2.5 days, the toxicity of both procedures as well as the need for supportive treatment is comparable.",
