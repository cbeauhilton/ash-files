    "abstract_text": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disorder, clinically characterized by congenital abnormalities, a fatal progressive bone marrow failure (BMF), and a predisposition to develop malignancies. Gene therapy by infusion of FA-corrected autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) may offer a potential alternative cure and to get around the problems of the Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation toxicity or the donor restriction. For gene therapy, an adequate number of HSC collected is a key point to a successful engraftment. However, the HSC collection in FA patients implies particular challenges because of their reduced BM stem cells numbers and implies a theorical risk of an inner depletion in stem cell reserve following collection.The main objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility and the safety of co-administration of G-CSF and plerixafor in patients with FA for the mobilization and collection of peripheral HSC for potential use in a GT trial. We present the results of this open-label phase I/II trial (N\u00b0EUDRACT 2014-005264-14) from 4 selected FANCA mutated patients (FA-A) with a weight >10 Kg and an age between 2 to 18 years old. A systematic combination of G-CSF (12\u03bcg/kg twice a day) plus plerixafor (Mozobil\u00ae 0.240 mg/kg/d ) was used to maximise the CD34+ cells mobilization. CD34+ cells and white blood cells (WBC) blood counts were monitored tightly along the mobilization protocol. No short-term adverse events linked to the mobilization and the collection procedures were observed. The combination of G-CSF and Plerixafor allowed crossing the PB mobilization threshold (\u22655 CD34 + cells/\u03bcL) for 2 patients. Interestingly, CD34 + cells were mobilized quickly but transitionally after plerixafor injection. One patient mobilization had more than 100 CD34 + cells \u03bc/L with a early peak 2h after injection. The peak disappeared 11 hours after injection. We adapted the time of collection to the C34+ cells mobilization. No CD34 + blood cell rebound was observed after the apheresis was stopped. Our new datas suggest that mobilization of FA patients with G-CSF and plerixafor is safe. However, the age of the patient, a potential cytopenia or the lack of bone marrow progenitor cell may heavely compromise the collection. Nevertheless, the datas show a stable cytopenia despite the stimulation and collection of stem cells during the following months. This study underlines that a very cautious collection of stem cell in the Fanconi anemia to consider gene therapy is a necessity. These results also confirm that the kinetic of CD34+ cells mobilization is one of the key point to a successful stem cell harvesting for gene therapy trial.
