    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3359 Introduction: Bacterial sepsis in recipients of transfusion products due to contamination of blood components is an infrequent but serious and potentially a fatal complication. Unlike red cells, platelet concentrates (PC) are stored for up to 5 days at room temperature after collection, which is conducive for bacterial growth. In 42% of the sepsis cases following PCs, the most common bacterial contaminant is Staphylococcus spp. Timely detection of these contaminated units is a public health priority. Although a multitude of bacterial diagnostic tests are available for PCs, still there is a need for developing more sensitive, specific and rapid detection assays. The primary objective of this study is to develop a simple and highly sensitive procedure that facilitates rapid and enhanced detection of bacteria using Staphylococcus aureus as a model for PCs. Methods: A commercially available bacteriophage-displayed random 12-mer peptide library was screened against S. aureus . The screening and subsequent sequencing of the phage DNA identified a phage clone containing a coding sequence for 12-amino acid peptide that selectively binds to S. aureus. We assessed the binding specificity and detection sensitivity of the peptide to a panel of six bacteria spiked in platelets (including S. aureus) by dot blot, ELISA and fluorometry. The peptides were further labeled with streptavidin-conjugated fluorescent Nanocrystal quantum-dots (Q-dots) to enhance the sensitivity of the assay. Results: The membrane-based dot blot method revealed that the peptide binds specifically to S. aureus . ELISA and fluorometry analysis of spiked platelet samples revealed that the peptide binds to S. aureus at 10 3 CFU/ml concentrations. By using the peptide-Nanocrystal Q-dot combination (peptide probes), the detection sensitivity was further enhanced. The peptide binding remained relatively constant between pH 5 to 7.5. Conclusion: This model system demonstrates that peptides derived from random phage library in combination with Nanocrystal Q-dots facilitate high sensitivity detection of S. aureus. In general, this study provides a proof-of-concept that \u2018peptide probes' selected against specific bacteria are useful in detecting and monitoring them in various settings relevant to blood safety and transfusion medicine.
