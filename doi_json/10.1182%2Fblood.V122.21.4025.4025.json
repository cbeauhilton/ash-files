    "abstract_text": "Bosutinib (BOS) is an oral dual Src/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). This open-label, phase 1/2 study evaluated BOS in patients (pts) with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP CML) following TKI failure. Pts (n=118) aged \u226518 y with prior imatinib (IM) failure plus dasatinib (D) resistance (D-R; n=38) or intolerance (D-I; n=50), nilotinib (N) resistance (N-R; n=26), or N-I or D-R/I + N-R/I (n=4) received BOS starting at 500 mg/d. Median (range) age was 56 (20\u201379) y; time from CML diagnosis was 6.6 (0.6\u201318.3) y; follow-up duration was 33.1 (0.3\u201384.8) mo; BOS treatment duration was 8.5 (0.2\u201378.1) mo. Escalation to BOS 600 mg/d occurred in 21 (18%) pts. For the last enrolled pt, time from first dose was \u226536 mo; 19% are still receiving BOS. Confirmed complete hematologic response (CHR) was newly attained or maintained from baseline by 73% of pts ( Table  ). Major cytogenetic response (MCyR) was attained/maintained by 40% of pts (32% with complete cytogenetic response [CCyR]). Kaplan-Meier probability of maintaining CHR or MCyR at 3 y was 65%.  .

View Large Of 85 pts with known baseline mutation status, 19 unique BCR-ABL mutations occurred in 39 (46%) pts, including 7 (8%) with T315I. Responses were seen across mutations, but were low in pts with T315I (29% CHR; 14% MCyR). In pts with \u22651 mutation, excluding T315I, 75% had CHR and 40% had MCyR. 38 pts had known baseline and end of treatment mutation status; 8/38 had \u22651 new mutation (V299L, n=4; T315I, n=2; F359C, G250E, L248V, n=1 each); 7/8 discontinued BOS due to disease progression or lack of efficacy. Cumulative incidence of on-treatment transformation to accelerated-phase (AP) CML at 3 y was 4%; 77% discontinued without transformation. No pt transformed to blast-phase (BP); no transformations occurred after 2 y. Cumulative incidence of on-treatment progression (transformation to AP/BP CML, increasing white blood cell count [doubling over \u22651 mo with 2nd count >20\u00d710 9 /L and confirmed \u22651 wk later], or loss of confirmed CHR or unconfirmed MCyR) or death at 3 y was 25%; 55% of pts discontinued without an event. Overall survival (OS) at 2 y was 84% ( Table  ; 3-y OS estimates unreliable; pts followed for OS for only 2 y after BOS discontinuation]). Overall, 96 (81%) pts discontinued treatment, the most common primary reasons were adverse event (AE; n=29 [25%]), disease progression (n=25 [21%]), or unsatisfactory efficacy (n=23 [19%]). 26 (22%) deaths occurred on study, 5 within 30 d of last BOS dose. Most deaths were due to disease progression (n=11 [9%]) or AE (n=11 [9%], including 1 death reported as treatment-related due to lower gastrointestinal bleeding). 4 deaths had unknown cause 33\u2013615 d after the last BOS dose. Non-hematologic treatment-emergent AEs in \u226520% of pts (all grades; grade 3/4) were diarrhea (83%; 9%), nausea (48%; 1%), vomiting (38%; 1%), rash (27%; 3%), headache (26%; 3%), fatigue (23%; 2%), and abdominal pain (24%; 1%); common hematologic toxicities included thrombocytopenia (38%; 26%), neutropenia (20%; 15%), and anemia (19%; 7%). Cardiac events occurred in 15% of pts (8% grade 3/4). Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities in \u226510% of pts were thrombocytopenia (26%), neutropenia (20%), lymphopenia (16%), and hypermagnesemia (12%). 78 (66%) pts had \u22651 dose delay; 59 (50%) had \u22651 dose reduction. 31 (26%) pts discontinued BOS due to AE, most commonly thrombocytopenia (7%). BOS continues to demonstrate durable efficacy and manageable toxicity after \u226536 mo follow-up in CP-CML pts following resistance or intolerance to multiple TKIs.
