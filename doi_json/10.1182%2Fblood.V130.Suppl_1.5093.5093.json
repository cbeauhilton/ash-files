    "abstract_text": "Our previous study reported that patients with AML1/ETO+ (A/E+) and expression of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) tended to develop Extra-medullary infiltration (EMI) and carried out of poor prognosis. In this study, we used kasumi-1 cells which carry A/E+ oncogene and APP gene as our cell model to detect the mechanisms in detail. After knockdown of APP expression, the cell migration was significantly reduced (P<0.05). Furthermore, Western-Blot showed that the protein expression of p-ERK, MMP-2 and c-Myc were significantly reduced after interference of APP, while CXCR4 and MMP-9 didn't change. After that, we co-culture p-ERK and c-Myc inhibition with Kasumi-1 cells respectively and demonstrated that APP/p-ERK/c-Myc/MMP-2 pathway was the signal transduction in regulation of cell migration. In further, we constructed miR-144 MIMICs and transfected Kasumi-1 cells, qRT-PCR and Western-Blot showed miR-144 was negatively regulated of APP. Based on these findings, we concluded that miR-144 negatively related with APP gene and regulate cell migration via APP/p-ERK/c-Myc/MMP-2 pathway.
