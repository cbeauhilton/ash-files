It has been traditionally defined by the presence of an absolute plasma cell count of > 2000/microL or >20% circulating plasma cells (cPCs) in the peripheral blood. However, several recent studies have validated the optimal cutoff for defining pPCL to be >5% cPCs on a peripheral blood smear due to equally poor outcomes in this less restrictive cohort. Hence, given the rarity of this disease entity, we evaluated the clinical outcomes and cytogenetic features of patients diagnosed with pPCL at our institution with the new proposed definition of pPCL by >5% cPCs on peripheral blood smear that were treated with novel agent induction therapies. METHODS: We evaluated all patients with pPCL diagnosed between 2000 - 2018 evaluated at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Data regarding these patients were extracted from a prospectively maintained database and from the review of the electronic medical records. Patients were categorized as having high risk cytogenetics if any of the following abnormalities were present: del 17p, t(4;14), t(14;16) or t(14;20). Chi-square tests and Fisher exact tests were used to compare differences between the sub-groups of interest. Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method and differences assessed using the log rank test. RESULTS: This cohort consisted of 71 patients with pPCL with a median age of 62 years (range: 34-91) of which 33 (46%) were male. The median follow up was 46 months (95% CI: 41 - 90). The median bone marrow plasma cell content was 84% (Range: 10 - 100) and the median plasma cell percentage on the peripheral smear was 23% (range: 5 - 93). There were 48 (68%) patients with >20% cPCs in their peripheral blood smear. Only 23 (32%) patients had concurrent information on the number of cPCs by multiparametric flow cytometry at diagnosis and the median number of cPCs detected was 32,807 per 150,000 events analyzed (Range: 354 - 132,256). There were 15/54 (28%) patients who presented with a creatinine of 2 mg/dL or greater and 17/55 (31%) pts who presented with hypercalcemia (11 mg/dL or greater). Data for ISS classification was available in 45 patients and is as follows: Stage 1- 3 (7%) patients, Stage 2- 10 (22%) patients and Stage 3- 32 (71%) patients. Data on the presence of primary cytogenetic abnormalities were available in 60 (85%) patients of which 29 (49%) had high risk cytogenetics. The distribution of primary cytogenetic abnormalities among this cohort was as follows: t(11;14) - 27 (45%), t(4;14) - 5 (8%), t(14;16) - 8 (13%), t(14;20)- 3(5%) and del 17p- 15(25%). All patients received novel agent induction therapy with 40 (57%) of them having received at least one autologous stem cell transplant and 1 patient undergoing an allogeneic stem cell transplant. The median overall survival (OS) for all pPCL patients in this cohort was 23 months (95% CI: 19 - 38). The OS was similar in patient with 5-19% cPCs vs. >20% cPCs (24 vs. 23 months, P = 0.999). However, when the entire cohort was stratified by cytogenetic risk, the median OS was 51 months for standard risk vs. 19 months for high risk (P = 0.005) (FIGURE). There were only 17 (30%) patients in this cohort who were alive for 48 months or longer since diagnosis (i.e. twice the median OS of this cohort) and they were more likely to not have high risk cytogenetics at diagnosis (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: In this analysis of one of the largest contemporary cohorts of pPCL patients, the outcomes of patients diagnosed with pPCL remain poor despite the use of novel agent induction therapy. However, some patients appear to do better than expected and this phenomenon may be influenced by the absence of high risk cytogenetics.
