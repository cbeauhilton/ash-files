    "abstract_text": "Abstract Text: Objective: The mortality rate of refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is very high with poor prognostic. Three are still no standard treatments for these patients nowadays. Our research compared the treatment effect between patients with chemotherapy and transplantation. Method: A retrospective research of 45 patients with refractory/relapsed AML was performed in our center. We analyzed the clinical features including gender, age, classification of AML, performance status (PS), complete remission (CR) duration, cytogenetic and molecular abnormities. Survival analyses were made by using the Kaplan Meier method and took the Log - rank test. Results: The mean survival time of the 45 patients with refractory/relapsed AML was (36.25\u00a1\u00c08.40) months and the median follow up was (9\u00a1\u00c02.58) months. The one year and two years overall survival rate was (40.6\u00a1\u00c07.5)% and (23.7\u00a1\u00c07.0)%. Univariate analysis results demonstrated that age\u00a1\u00dd60 years and failing to undergo HSCT after relapse had poor influence on OS. Conclusion: Performance of HSCT after relapse can improve the prognosis through the single center study. HSCT is still the effective salvage therapy for patients with refractory/relapsed AML. Our research is benefit for individual therapy and can be applied to improve the survival. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
