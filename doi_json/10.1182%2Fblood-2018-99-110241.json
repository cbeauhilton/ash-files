    "abstract_text": "Abstract: Background: Upfront autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HCT) combined with novel anti-myeloma drugs is considered the standard of care for transplant-eligible patients with multiple myeloma (MM). However, this treatment is generally avoided in older patients due to concerns about toxicity. MM is primarily a disease of the elderly, with >35% patients being older than 70 years of age at diagnosis. We have previously reported on the role of auto-HCT in MM patients >70 years 1 . In this study, we evaluate the safety and feasibility of auto-HCT in patients \u226580 years who received auto-HCT at our institution. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of MM patients with age \u226580 years who underwent auto-HCT between January, 2007, and June, 2018. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated from the date of auto-HCT to the last follow up or the censored date. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate PFS and OS. Results: Between January, 2013, and December, 2017, out of a total of 1465 MM patients referred for evaluation for auto-HCT at our institution, only 10(0.68%) were of age \u226580 years. Also, between January, 2016, and June, 2018, a total of 210 MM patients with age \u226580 years were treated at our institution, and only 3(0.14%) underwent auto-HCT. Overall among 1740 patients with MM who received an auto-HCT at our institution between the beginning of 2007 to June, 2018, 9(0.5%) patients were \u2265 80 years of age (range 80-83). Table 1 summarizes the patient characteristics of these nine patients. All patients had an ECOG performance status of either 0 or 1. The median hematopoietic stem cell transplant - comorbidity index for the cohort was 3 (range, 0-5). Eight (89%) patients were in first remission, and 1 (11%) patient had relapsed disease at auto-HCT. All patients received melphalan at a reduced dose of 140 mg/m 2 as the conditioning regimen. Eight patients (89%) received maintenance therapy with lenalidomide. The median follow-up from auto-HCT was 18 months (range 0.5 - 50 months). No (0%) patient died within 100 days of auto-HCT. Out of 8 evaluable patients, 4 (50%) achieved a complete response, 2 (25%) very-good partial, and 2 (25%) achieved a partial response with an overall response rate of 100%. Eight (89%) patients were alive until the last follow-up. Median PFS was 31.5 months, while the median OS has not been reached (Fig1). 2-yr PFS and OS were 62.5% and 75% respectively. One patient died 22 months post-transplant due to non-transplant related cause. Conclusions: In selected MM patients \u226580 years old, auto-HCT was feasible, with 0% TRM, 100% response rate, and 2-year OS of 75%. Almost 90% of these patients went on to receive maintenance therapy. References: Qazilbash, M. H. et al.
