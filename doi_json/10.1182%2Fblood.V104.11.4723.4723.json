    "abstract_text": "To evaluate the efficacy of GO + ara-c in high risk pts, we treated 22 pts with MDS (10) and AML (12) with cytarabine 100 mg/m 2 /d x 7 d and GO 9 mg/m 2 x 1 on d 4. Pts with MDS were eligible if they had [1] RAEB-1 and either hgb < 8 gm/dl, platelet < 50,000/mm 3 , neutrophils < 1000/mm 3 , or cytogenetics other than 5q-, 20q-, -y, or normal, [2] RAEB-2, or [3] CMML. Pts with AML (newly diagnosed or relapsed) were eligible if they were ineligible for anthracycline-based therapy (poor performance status: 2 pts; low ejection fraction or high cumulative dose of anthracyclines: 6 pts, both reasons: 4 pts). The median age was 66, M:12, F:10. Diagnoses: RAEB-1: 4, RAEB-2: 5, CMML: 1, AML, newly dx\u2019d: 7, AML relapsed: 5. Cytogenetics were high risk: 10, intermediate risk: 11 pts, low risk: 1 pt. Overall, 18% had a complete response (CR) after one cycle of therapy. Three pts (14%) had a partial response (PR), of which one had a CR after a second course of therapy. Of the pts with AML: CR: 2/12, PR: 2/12, Failure (F): 5/12, Toxic Death (TD): 3/12. For pts with MDS: CR: 2/10, PR: 1/10, F: 5/10, TD: 2/10. Toxicities included neutropenic fever/sepsis, mucositis, diarrhea, increased LFTs, hemorrhage. One pt with a history of ABVD and RT to chest for HD developed direct pulmonary toxicity due to chemotherapy (diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, biopsy proven toxic lung damage). Although overall response rate is modest, some pts had remarkable responses: One pt with RAEB-1, transfusion dependent and multiple high risk cytogenetics (\u22125, \u22127, multiple others) remains in CR (including cytogenetic CR) 7 months post treatment. A second pt with RAEB-1, transfusion dependent and multiple high risk cytogenetics (\u22125, \u22127, multiple others) had a PR after one course, but was unable to receive further chemotherapy due to toxicity. The latter pts suggest that this regimen should be studied further in pts with MDS, poor risk cytogenetics and low blast counts."
