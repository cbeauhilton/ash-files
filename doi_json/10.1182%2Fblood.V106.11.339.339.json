    "abstract_text": "We recently demonstrated that signalling through the cytokine tyrosine kinase receptor flt3 and interleukin-7 receptor \u03b1 (IL-7R\u03b1 ) is indispensable for fetal and adult B cell commitment and development ( Sitnicka et al., J. Exp. Med . 198 : 1495 , 2003 ). We have also shown that flt3 ligand (FL)-deficient mice have reduced levels of the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) but normal levels of mature T cells ( Sitnicka et al., Immunity , 17 : 463 , 2002 ). However, previous studies failed to demonstrate a role of flt3 and its ligand in T lymphopoiesis. Herein, although having normal numbers of thymocytes, FL-deficient mice were shown to have distinct reductions in the earliest double negative (DN) progenitors in the fetal, postnatal and adult thymus. A critical role of flt3 in thymocyte development was most evident in the absence of Interleukin-7 receptor a (IL-7R\u03b1 ) signalling. Strikingly, in adult FL \u2212/\u2212 IL-7R\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 (double deficient) mice thymic cellularity was reduced 400 fold as compared to FL \u2212/\u2212 and wild type (WT) controls and 30 fold as compared to IL-7R\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. In agreement with previous studies, IL-7R\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 thymocytes revealed a partial block at the progression from the DN2 (CD4 \u2212 CD8 \u2212 CD44 + CD25 + ) to DN3 (CD4 \u2212 CD8 \u2212 CD44 \u2212 CD25 + ) stage, while in FL \u2212/\u2212 IL-7R\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 mice DN1 (CD4 \u2212 CD8 \u2212 CD44 + CD25 \u2212 ), DN2 and DN3 thymic progenitors were undetectable. The DP CD4 + CD8 + thymocytes were reduced more than 1000 fold as compared to IL-7R\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 mice and low levels of peripheral T cells remaining in FL \u2212/\u2212 IL-7R\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 mice had exclusively an activated/memory phenotype. Furthermore, FL \u2212/\u2212 IL-7R\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 bone marrow cells lacked T cell reconstituting potential after transplantation into lethally irradiated recipients. Taken together these data demonstrate indispensable and complementary roles of flt3 and IL-7R\u03b1 in T lymphopoiesis.",
