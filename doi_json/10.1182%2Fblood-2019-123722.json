    "abstract_text": "BCL-2 inhibition exerts effective pro-apoptotic activities in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but clinical efficacy as a monotherapy was limited in part due to the treatment-induced MCL-1 increase. Triptolide (TPL) exhibits anti-tumor activities in part by upregulating pro-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins and decreasing MCL-1 expression in various malignant cells. We hypothesized that combined BCL-2 inhibition and TPL exert synergistic anti-leukemia activities and prevent the resistance to BCL-2 inhibition in AML. We here report that TPL combined with BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 synergistically induced apoptosis in leukemic cells regardless of p53 status through activating the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in vitro. Although ABT-199 or TPL alone inhibited AML growth in vivo, the combination therapy demonstrated a significantly stronger anti-leukemic effect. Mechanistically, TPL significantly upregulated BH3 only proteins including PUMA, NOXA, BID and BIM and decreased MCL-1 but upregulated BCL-2 expression in both p53 wild type and p53 mutant AML cell lines, while the combination decreased both BCL-2 and MCL-1 and further increased BH3 only BCL-2 proteins. MCL-1 and BCL-2 increases associated with respective ABT-199 and TPL treatment and resistance were also observed in vivo. Significantly downregulating MCL-1 and elevating BH3 only proteins by TPL could not only potentially block MCL-1-mediated resistance but also enhance anti-leukemic efficacy of ABT-199. Conversely, BCL-2 inhibition counteracted the potential resistance of TPL mediated by upregulation of BCL-2. The combination further amplified the effect, which likely contributed to the synthetic lethality. This mutual blockade of potential resistance provides a rational basis for the promising clinical application of TPL and BCL-2 inhibition in AML independent of p53 status.
