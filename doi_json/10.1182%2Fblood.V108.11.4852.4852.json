    "abstract_text": "Objective: To explore the possible immune annormality of CD28 costimulatory super family and CD4 + T regulatory (CD4 + Treg) in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Methods: Gated by CD3 and SSC, the changes of CD28, CTLA-4, PD-1, and CD25, on CD3 + CD4 + cells were evaluated in 38 new diagnosed cases with MDS(RA 17, RAS 1, RAEB 14, RAEB-t 6) and 11 normal controls respectively by directive immune labels. Results: [circ1]In the group of MDS, the CD3 + CD4 + CD28 + was 79.82%\u00b18.99% ( RA 78.65%\u00b110.4%, RAEB/RAEB-t 80.10%\u00b17.28% respectively), was lower than 89.56%\u00b13.06% of normal controls (P<0.01); CD3 + CD4 + CTLA-4 + , CD3 + CD4 + PD-1 + , and CD3 + CD4 + CD25 + were 2.14%\u00b11.25% (RA 1.51%\u00b10.80%, RAEB/RAEB-t 2.65%\u00b11.33%), 1.44%\u00b10.88% (RA 0.93%\u00b10.63%, RAEB/RAEB-t 2.02%\u00b10.76%), and 3.18%\u00b12.11%(RA 2.80%\u00b11.38%, RAEB/ RAEB-t 3.41%\u00b12.46%) in MDS, which were all higher than those (0.11%\u00b10.12%, 0.09%\u00b10.14% and 1.65%\u00b11.14% respectively) of normal controls (P<0.01). [circ2] Along with the progress of MDS, the expression of CTLA-4, PD-1 and CD25 on CD3 + CD4 + cells increased significantly in RAEB/RAEB-t than RA. [circ3] The antagonism costimulatory of CTLA-4/CD28 decreased from normal controls (0.11\u00b10.11) to RA (2.14\u00b10.97), then to RAEB/RAEB-t (3.58\u00b11.55) significantly. Conclusion: [circ1] In MDS, the immune priming factor-CD28 decreased while the suppressive factor-CTLA-4 increased. [circ2] The negative immune CD4 + regulatory increased in MDS, and was predominance in immune balance. [circ3] Along with progression of MDS, negative regulatory factors was enforced, which promoted clone of MDS expansion."
