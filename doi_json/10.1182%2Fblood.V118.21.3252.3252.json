    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3252 PTEN (Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted in chromosome 10) is a well-known tumor suppressor. PTEN dephosphorylates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 into PtdIns(4,5)P2 and thereby negatively regulates PIP3-downstream signaling. According to present studies, PTEN is also a protein tyrosine phosphatase. In 2010 ( Blood. 2010;116(14):2579\u201381 ), we reported that hematopoietic specific PTEN deficiency causes an increased platelet count, a shortened tail vein bleeding time, and enhanced platelet activation in response to stimulation by collagen and other agonists along with augmented collagen-induced phosphorylation of platelet Akt at Ser473. The PI3K specific inhibitor LY294002 almost completely blocked collagen-induced WT platelet aggregation, but had less effect on PTEN-deficient platelets. This result implies that PTEN may regulate collagen-induced platelet activation via both PI3K/Akt signaling and an yet to be identified pathway. In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying PTEN regulation of collagen-induced platelet activation. It is well-known that the GPVI receptor signaling cascade is similar to that of T- and B-cell immune receptors. This signaling cascade relies on the formation of a signalosome composed of the transmembrane adapter LAT (linker for activation of T cells), the two cytosolic adapters SLP-76 and Gads , and the activation of PLC\u03b32. Accordingly, we investigated the phosphorylation of LAT, SLP-76 and PLC\u03b32 in PTEN-deficient and WT platelets in response to low level collagen (2\u03bcg/ml) , with and without LY294002 pre-incubation. The platelet lysate was immunoprecipitated with 4G10, a specific anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, to detect tyrosine phosphorylation. Interestingly, we found that in the presence of LY294002, the phosphorylation levels of LAT, SLP-76 and PLC\u03b32 were very high in PTEN-deficient platelets while the phosphorylation of these molecules was hardly detectable in WT platelets, all in response to low level collagen. These results suggested that PTEN may also regulate platelet activation through LAT, SLP-76 and PLC\u03b32. This hypothesis was supported by co-immunopricipitation experiments demonstrating that PTEN interacts with LAT in platelets upon collagen stimulation. Moreover, we also found that PTEN Ser380 phosphorylation was correlated with collagen-induced WT platelet activation without LY294002, and PTEN Ser380 phosphorylation could be inhibited by CK2 inhibitor DMAT and PDK1 inhibitor II, but not by Akt inhibitor SH6 or the GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor LiCl. In contrast, the PDK1 inhibitor II blocked collagen-induced activation of CK2. Radioactivity assays indicated that collagen-induced enzyme activity activation of CK2 was blocked by the PDK1 inhibitor II. Ser380 phosphorylation is thought to reflect the loss of PTEN phosphatase function. So, because inhibition of PI3K, and PDK1 do not result in phosphorylation of PTEN S380 and the resulting loss of PTEN phosphatase function, it may be true that PDK1 inactivates PTEN. Therefore, we conclude that the mechanism of PTEN involvement in collagen-induced platelet activation is complicated, and PTEN plays a key role in GPVI mediated platelet activation probably through down-regulating both the PI3K/Akt and PI3K-PDK1-LAT pathways. We also investigated PTEN's function in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 mediated platelet activation. Platelet spreading and clot retraction experiments were performed. We found that PTEN deficiency significantly promoted clot retraction, but had no effect on platelet spreading on immobilized fibrinogen. Moreover, U46619 and thrombin induced PTEN ser380 phosphorylation was inhibited in \u03b23 deficient platelet. These results indicate that PTEN is also involved in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 mediated outside-in signaling. Although the molecular mechanism of PTEN modulation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 mediated outside-in signaling is unclear, our results may partially explain why PTEN deficiency also enhances platelet aggregation and secretion in response to agonists other than collagen.
