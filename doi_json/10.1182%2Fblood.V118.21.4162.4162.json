    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4162 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been associated with a graft-versus-myeloma effect and may be the only potentially curative option for patients with advanced multiple myeloma. Unfortunately, the majority of patients (pts) do not have an HLA-identical sibling. Unrelated donor transplantation is an alternative option for these patients. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with advanced multiple myeloma who received an unrelated donor (URD) hematopoietic stem cell transplant at our institution between 11/1997 and 11/2010. Analyses were done using Kaplan Meier survival and Cox regression on the SAS version 9.2 software. Between 11/1997 and 11/2010, 27 pts with multiple myeloma received an URD transplant. One patient was lost to follow-up and 26 pts are evaluable. Patient characteristics included: median age 52 years (range 37\u201364), male 58%, all patients had prior autologous transplant (23% of pts had 2 or more prior transplants), and 43% of pts had refractory or progressive disease at the time of transplantation. Transplant regimens were ablative (defined as melphalan dose > 140mg/m2) in 73% of pts. GVHD prophylaxis was tacrolimus-based in all. Hematopoietic cell source was peripheral blood for 92% of pts, 46% of pts received a 10/10 HLA matched URD and 54% had a least one allele mismatch. Results: With a median follow up of 3.4 years, 54% of patients are alive and 47% of patients are progression-free. The treatment-related mortality at day 100 was 15%. The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 44% and chronic GVHD 25%. Univariate analysis of risk of progression or relapse and overall survival failed to show any significance for disease status at the time of transplantation, degree of donor match, transplant regimen, refractoriness to bortezomib or lenalidomide, acute or chronic GVHD. Conclusion: In this analysis, URD transplantation has an acceptable treatment related mortality, and leads to durable remissions even in patients with relapsed and/or refractory disease. The 3.4 year PFS is similar to the BMT CTN 0102 sibling data and compares favorably to related donor transplantation for relapsed disease. In comparison to the BMT CTN study, the preparative regimen in this current analysis was overall more intense and regimen intensity has been previously shown to be significant. Allogeneic transplantation is an effective treatment strategy in multiple myeloma. Unrelated donor transplantation should be offered to patients with advanced multiple myeloma who do not have an HLA-identical sibling. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
