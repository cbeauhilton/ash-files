    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND Combined fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) was the preferred regimen for young fit patients (pts) with CLL. The CLL10 trial established FCR as the preferred first-line chemoimmunotherapy (CIT). Recently, the E1912 trial compared first-line FCR vs. ibrutinib + rituximab for young fit pts with CLL. The ibrutinib arm showed an improved PFS and OS vs. the FCR arm; however, there was no difference in PFS for mutated IGHV (M-IGHV) group. With the FCR studies, it is already known that the long-term benefit is seen in pts with M-IGHV. In the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) FCR trial, long-term follow up demonstrated that the PFS at 10 yrs was approximately 55% for M-IGHV pts with a plateau after 8 yrs, suggesting that these pts may be cured of their CLL. Hence, CIT remains an appropriate first-line option for pts with M-IGHV with fixed duration treatment and expectation for long treatment-free interval. We hypothesized that 1) achieving higher U-MRD would improve PFS and OS and 2) reducing the amount of chemotherapy might lower the risk of t-MDS/AML. We thus developed a CIT regimen called iFCG which consists of ibrutinib, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and obinutuzumab (GA101) for young fit CLL patients with mutated IGHV and without del(17p)/mutated TP53 . To decrease chemotherapy exposure, we administered only 3 cycles of chemotherapy in the iFCG regimen. METHODS We designed a phase II study for previously untreated pts with CLL with M-IGHV and absence of del(17p)/mutated TP53 (NCT02629809). All pts had a 2008 IWCLL indication for treatment. Pts received ibrutinib, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, obinutuzumab for the first 3 cycles. Pts who achieved CR/CRi with bone marrow (BM) undetectable minimal residual disease (U-MRD) after the first 3 cycles received 9 additional cycles of ibrutinib with 3 additional cycles of obinutuzumab; all other pts received 9 additional cycles of ibrutinib and obinutuzumab. Pts with U-MRD (CR/CRi or PR) at 12 cycles stop all therapy, including ibrutinib. Responses were assessed by 2008 IWCLL criteria with BM and CT scans every 3 cycles during the first yr. BM MRD was assessed by flow cytometry (sensitivity 10 -4 ). Post-cycle 12, pts have MRD assessed in blood every 6 months. In pts with available BM samples, MRD was also assessed by an NGS assay (sensitivity up to 10 -6 ). RESULTS 45 pts were treated. Pretreatment characteristics are in Table 1. The median follow-up is 30.2 months. After 3 cycles of iFCG, 39% achieved CR/CRi and 89% achieved BM U-MRD. Responses improved with continued therapy with ibrutinib and obinutuzumab (Figure 1); 73% achieved CR/CRi and 100% achieved BM U-MRD after cycle 12. 41/45 pts completed all planned 12 cycles (4 pts came off study, details below). Per trial design, all 41 pts completing 12 cycles of treatment discontinued ibrutinib since all achieved U-MRD. PFS and OS are shown in Figure 2. No pt had MRD recurrence, CLL progression or Richter transformation, with a median follow-up of 18.7 months (range, 0.2-28.8) post discontinuing ibrutinib. In pts with available BM samples, we also assessed MRD by NGS assay. After 3 cycles of iFCG, 68% (n=28) achieved U-MRD at 10 -5 sensitivity and 50% (n=22) achieved U-MRD at 10 -6 sensitivity. After cycle 6, the corresponding numbers were 83% (n=30) and 58% (n=24), respectively. After cycle 12, the corresponding numbers were 91% (n=22) and 63% (n=16), respectively. Reasons for study discontinuation included 1) death due to CHF (see below), 2) pulmonary MAC infection, 3) infusion reaction to obinutuzumab, and 4) pt decision. One pt died; 26-yr-old man who developed CHF in cycle 9 (receiving ibrutinib and obinutuzumab). He had no known cardiac comorbidities; he started a weight loss supplement (sympathomimetic agent) few days prior to symptom onset. The pt died from worsening heart failure. One pt developed t-MDS. Grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 58% and 40% pts, respectively. Neutropenic fever occurred in 6 pts (culture negative 4 pts, PJP pneumonia 1 pt, staphylococcus skin infection 1 pt). Additional infectious complications without neutropenia leading to hospitalization included pneumonia (culture negative) (n=2), cellulitis (n=1), pulmonary MAC infection (n=1), fever (n=1), acute cholecystitis (n=1), and colitis (n=1). CONCLUSIONS The iFCG regimen with only 3 cycles of chemotherapy is an effective time-limited regimen for young pts with M-IGHV and without del(17p)/ mutated TP53 .
