    "abstract_text": "Background: TP53 mutant mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is associated with poor survival outcomes with chemoimmunotherapy (Eskelund Blood 2017) and there is no standard frontline treatment for this high-risk patient population. The combination of Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibition and the BCL2 inhibition have been shown to be synergistic and active in relapsed, refractory MCL, including in patients with TP53 mutation (Tam NEJM 2018). Obinutuzumab, ibrutinib, and venetoclax has been shown to be well tolerated and associated with high response rates in relapsed and untreated MCL patients (Le Gouill Blood 2021). We hypothesize that treatment with zanubrutinib (B; BGB-3111; BTK inhibitor), obinutuzumab (O; CD20 antibody), and venetoclax (Ven; BCL2 inhibitor) (BOVen) will be well tolerated and efficacious in untreated TP53 mutant MCL. Methods: In this multicenter, investigator-initiated phase 2 trial (NCT03824483), eligible pts had previously untreated MCL with TP53 mutation (any variant allele frequency allowed) and ECOG PS1, PLT >75, HGB >=9 (unless if due to MCL). BOVen is administered in 28D cycles: B 160 mg PO BID starting D1; O 1000 mg IV D1 or split D1-2, 8, 15 of C1, D1 of C2-8; Ven ramp up initiated C3D1 (target 400 mg QD). Tx duration is 2 years at minimum and primary endpoint is 2-year progression-free survival. Adverse events (AE) were assessed per CTCAE v5. Results: 12 patients have been enrolled of the 25 total planned accrual. The median age on study was 67.5 years (range 29 - 79); 83% were male (10/12); various histologic subtypes were included (9 conventional MCL, 2 non-nodal leukemic, and 1 blastoid variant); 100% stage IV (12/12); by MIPI: 75% high risk (9/12), 17% intermediate (2/12), and 8% low risk MIPI score (1/12); 90% Ki67 >=30% (n=9/10); 50% Ki67>=50% (n=5/10); and 50% 17p deletion (n=6/12). All 12 patients were evaluable for toxicity. The grade 3 treatment-related AEs were limited to infusion-related reaction (17%, n=2 pts), neutropenia (8%, n=1 pt) that resolved with GCSF support, and elevation of transaminases (8%, n=1 pt). The most common treatment-related AEs (occurred in more than 1 patient) were low-grade and included: infusion-related reaction (17%, grade 1-2, n=3), neutropenia (17%, grade 1-2, n=2), thrombocytopenia (25%, grade 1, n=3), nausea (33%, grade 1, n=4), elevation of transaminases, (17%, grade 1, n=2), and rash (17%, grade 1, n=2). There was one treatment-related serious adverse event of fever without neutropenia that occurred on C3D2 after BOVen treatment. Pt was discharged after brief hospitalization in stable condition with resolution of fever and negative infectious work up. No dose reductions or modifications were required. No pts had laboratory/clinical TLS (Howard). Median follow up was 4 months (0 - 11 months). One pt has progressed and eleven pts remain on study in continued response. Of the 10 patients who have undergone disease restaging by Lugano criteria at C3 post BO, 80% (n=8/10) achieved PET-CR which has been maintained in 2 patients at C7. One patient, who has TP53, CARD11, and SMARCA4 mutations, achieved stable disease at C3, converted to a partial response at C7, and is now progressing during C12. The other patient had progressive disease by Lugano criteria at C3 with a mixed response on PET/CT with some sites of tumor regression, but after the addition of venetoclax pt had resolution of bulky palpable adenopathy and systemic symptoms. All patients had baseline positive peripheral blood flow cytometry (PBFC) and at C3 90% (n=9/10) had negative PBFC. Conclusions: BOVen was well tolerated in untreated TP53 mutant MCL. The preliminary efficacy is promising in this high-risk subset of MCL, however, follow-up is limited. Updated response data, including minimal residual disease assessment using a next-generation immunosequencing (IS) assay, will be presented at the meeting.
