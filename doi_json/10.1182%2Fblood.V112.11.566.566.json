    "abstract_text": "This retrospective analysis concerned 374 patients (pts) who underwent an allogeneic HSCT for CLL reported to the EBMT registry. There were 282 males (75%) and 92 females with a median age of 53 years (24\u201369). The interval between diagnosis and transplantation was 53 months (3\u2013308). Forty-five pts (12%) have received a previous HSCT. At transplant, 302 among 323 evaluated patients had a good performance status (PS) (93%), 51 pts were in CR (14%), 163 in PR (45.5%), 39 in SD (11.5%) and 105 in PD (29%) among 353 evaluated patients. Two hundred and ninety-two pts received a standard (Std) and 82 a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (RIC); 314 pts received PBSC, 55 BM and 5 cord blood cells from 202 HLA siblings (Sib), 2 mismatched related donors and 170 unrelated donors (UD). There were 136 (36%) sex-mismatched (90 F/M and 46 M/F), 150 pairs (40%) had an ABO incompatibility (61 minor, 99 major) and for CMV: 80 pairs were +, 148\u2212 and 112 mixed. After transplantation, 359 pts engrafted, 201 pts developed an AGVHD (gr I: 76, gr II : 79, gr III: 30 and gr IV:16) and 153 presented a cGVHD (75 limited and 78 extensive). At day 100 after transplant, the cumulative incidence of AGVHD for the total population was 17% (13\u201322) for gr I, 31% (26\u201336) for gr \u2265 II. [Sib: 19% (13\u201325) gr I and 27% (21\u201334) gr \u2265 II; UD: 16% (9\u201322) gr I and 38% (29\u201347) gr \u2265 II]. Results concerning the cumulative incidence of AGVHD according to HLA typing and kind of conditioning are shown in Table I. At 1 year after transplant for the total population, the cumulative incidence of limited and extensive cGVHD were 15 % (6\u201324) and 29.5% (18\u201341) for Std; 18.6 (13\u201324) and 18% (13\u201323) for RIC respectively. With a median follow up of 38 months, the probability of 3-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for the total group were 56% (51\u201362) and 47.4 % (42\u201353); 49 % (43\u201356) and 42% (36\u201348.5) respectively. We observed a significant difference concerning 5-year OS according to the pretransplant disease status [CR: 73% (60\u201389), PR: 57% (48\u201368) and PD: 35% (26\u201346)] (p<0.00001). There was no significant difference between standard and RIC HSCT in term of OS with 52.4 % (42\u201366) and 47% (40\u201355.5) respectively (p=0.44) (Figure 1) [Std and RIC Sib: 51% (37\u201370) and 56% (47\u201367); Std and RIC UD: 60% (44\u201383) and 40% (29\u201355) respectively]. The multivariate analysis using Cox model showed a significant impact of 3 factors on OS: age: HR=1.061 (1.02\u20131.10) p<0.0001, gender: HR=2.29 (1.02\u20135.11) p=0.04 and PS: HR=3.15 (1.40\u20137.10) p=0.005. The cumulative incidence of non-relapse and relapse mortality (NRM and RM) at 3 months and 1 year after transplant were: 10 % (7\u201313), 5% (3\u20137) and 24% (19\u201328), 15% (12\u201319) respectively [Std:23 % (11\u201335.6), 6% (0\u201314) 1 year; RIC: 22.5% (17.5\u201327), 18% (13\u201322) at 1 year]. Results concerning the cumulative incidence of NRM and RM according to HLA typing and kind of conditioning are shown in Table I. This large retrospective analysis showed a high percentage of long-term OS after HSCT for CLL either after Std or RIC conditioning without any difference between the 2 groups except for the AGVHD (gr I, III and IV) where we had an higher incidence in the Std group, and for the RM with a higher level in the RIC group. Moreover, we demonstrated the important impact of disease status pretransplant (univariate); age, PS and sex-matching (multivariate) on the global OS.
