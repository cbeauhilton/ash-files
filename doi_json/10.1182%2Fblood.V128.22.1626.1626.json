    "abstract_text": "Background: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells with specificity against CD19 have demonstrated dramatic promise against highly refractory hematologic malignancies. Clinical responses with complete remission rates as high as 90% have been reported in children and adults with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, very significant toxicity has been observed and as many as 30% in average developing severe forms of CRS and possibly related neurotoxicity. CRS is occurring due to large secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly from macrophages/monocytes, and resembles macrophage-activating syndrome and hemophagocytosis in response to CAR T-secreting IFN-g and possibly additional cytokines. To better understand the mechanisms leading to CRS and to treat or prevent it, we have developed in vitro and in vivo models of CRS with and without CAR-modified T cells. Early apoptotic cells that have been successfully tested for the prevention of acute GVHD, including in 7 ALL patients, were tested in these models for their effect on cytokines and CAR T cell cytotoxicity. Methods: CD19-expressing HeLa cells were used alone or with co-incubation with human macrophages for in vitro experiments and intraperitoneal experiments. Raji was used in vivo for leukemia induction. LPS and IFN-\u03b3 were used to trigger additional cytokine release. CD19-specific CAR-modified cells were used (ProMab) for anti-tumor effect against CD19-bearing cells. Cytotoxicity assay was examined in vivo using 7-AAD with flow cytometry and in vitro by survival curves and analysis of tumor load in bone marrow and liver. CRS occurred spontaneously or in response to LPS and IFN-\u03b3. Mouse IL-10, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IP-10, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IFN\u03b1, IL-9, IL-13, IFN-\u03b3, IL-12p70, GM-CSF, TNF-\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, IL-17A, IL-15/IL-15R, and IL-7, as well as 32 human cytokines were evaluated by Luminex technology using the MAPIX system analyzer (Mereck Millipore) and MILLIPLEX Analyst software (Merek Millipore). Mouse IL-6R\u03b1, MIG (CXCL9), and TGF-\u03b21 were evaluated by Quantikine ELISA (R&D systems). Bone marrow and liver were evaluated using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. The IFN-\u03b3 effect was evaluated by STAT1 phosphorylation and biological products. Human macrophages and dendritic cells were generated from monocytes. Early apoptotic cells were produced as shown in GVHD clinical trial; at least 50% of cells were annexin V-positive and less than 5% were PI-positive. Results: Apoptotic cells had no negative effect in vitro or in vivo on CAR-modified T cells with specificity against CD19. There were comparable E/T ratios for CAR T in the presence or absence of apoptotic cells in vitro, and comparable survival curves in vivo. On the other hand, significant downregulation (p<0.01) of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IP-10, TNF-a, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, was documented. IFN-\u03b3 was not downregulated, but its effect on macrophages and dendritic cells was inhibited at the level of phosphorylated STAT1 and IFN-\u03b3-induced expression of CXCL10 and CXCL9 was reduced. Conclusion: CRS evolves from several factors, including tumor biology, interaction with monocytes/macrophages/dendritic cells, and as a response to the CAR T cell effect and expansion. Apoptotic cells decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines that originate from innate immunity and inhibit the IFN-\u03b3 effect on monocyte/macrophages/ dendritic cells without harming IFN-\u03b3 levels or CAR-T cytotoxicity.
