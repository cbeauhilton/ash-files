    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5131 Cytoxan is an active drug in the treatment of multiple myeloma. It is commonly reserved for patients who became refractory to common active drug therapy or in combination with other active agents such as bortezomib, pegylated liposmal doxorubicin, vincristine, melphalan and decadron in patients who are not eligible for autologous bone marrow transplant. This abstract is intended to present interesting side effect of cytoxan that seen only in multiple myeloma and not seen in other hematological malignancies or solid tumors. Gynecomastia is defined as hypertrophy of breast tissue in male which can be seen in various medical condition associated with endocrine disturbances. In this abstract will describe five cases of significant degree of gynecomastia that seen exclusively in african american males and not seen in white males. Median age of patients is 57 years, range 40\u201368. Three has failed tandem autologus bone marrow transplant and has been exposed to lenalidomide and bortezomib. The other two have failed many lines of therapy including melphalan and prednisone. Gynecomastia has not been seen in other white males who received cytoxan in the treatment of multiple myeloma. The degree of gynecomastia was very significant in all of the five african american males. Also this is a limited number of patients but it is interesting enough to draw attention on possible endocrine disturbances seen particularly in multiple myeloma and other plasma cell dyscrasia such as Poems syndrome. The fact that gynecomastia is exclusively seen in african american males who all denied abusing marijuana is of scientific interest that needed further study and attention.
