    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4017 Poster Board III-953 The integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 plays an essential role in platelet aggregation. Following platelet stimulation by agonists, \u03b1IIb\u03b23 on the platelet surface shifts from an inactive low affinity conformation unable to bind ligands to an active high affinity conformation that can bind fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor. These \u03b1IIb\u03b23-bound macromolecules then crosslink platelets into aggregates. \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is thought to be present on the platelet surface in a bent conformation that is maintained by interactions involving residues located in its cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and stalk domains. Crystal structures of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and related integrin extracellular domains indicate that large conformational movements occur during activation and specific point mutations in the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic domains lead to ligand binding, likely by disrupting the inactive state heterodimer interface. One region of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 that has not been studied in detail is the large intramolecular interface located in the stalk region. To test the hypothesis that the interface between the \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 stalks observed in the crystal structure of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 extracellular domain is an important part of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation equilibrium, we employed a negative design strategy in which the Rosetta energy function was used to predict alanine mutations in \u03b23 that would most destabilize the stalk interface. Negative design is a way to control the direction of protein interactions by introducing changes in protein structure that destabilize undesired interactions. In this case, the undesired interaction is the inactive heterodimer stalk interface. The Rosetta energy function used here has been shown to accurately predict the effect of alanine mutations at protein interfaces. Initially, mutations were predicted based on the available crystal structure of the \u03b1v\u03b23 heterodimer. Subsequently, a crystal structure for inactive \u03b1IIb\u03b23 was reported. The functional consequences of the predicted mutations were then tested by introducing the mutations into full-length \u03b23 expressed in CHO cells. Two mutations, V664A and Y594A, were selected by the design algorithm as particularly disruptive in the interface and caused substantial constitutive \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation when introduced into full-length \u03b23. By contrast, the mutation, D552A, predicted to be slightly destabilizing in \u03b1V\u03b23, but not destabilizing in \u03b1IIb\u03b23, had essentially no effect on \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activity. These results confirm the utility of the negative design approach to identifying functionally significant regions in integrins. Further, they demonstrate that the stalk interface, much like the transmembrane domain interface, plays an important role in the equilibrium between active and inactive states of \u03b1IIb\u03b23. The large intermolecular stalk interface appears to be important for inside-out integrin signaling and deserves further study for its role in the transmission of signals from the intracelluar to the extracellular regions of integrins.
