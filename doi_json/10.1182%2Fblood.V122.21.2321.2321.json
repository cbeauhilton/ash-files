    "abstract_text": "Background Different studies have investigated the link between helicobacter pylori and extra digestive diseases suchas ITP. Aims In most studies chronic ITP has been investigated, therefore in the present study, we focused on the effect of H.pylori eradication on chronicity of ITP in adult patients with acute ITP. Methods After obtaining informed consent, eighty five patients with acute ITP whose platelet count were less than 30 \u00d7103 /\u03bcl were enrolled to the study. Urea breath test (UBT) was carried out for all the patients. Based on the UBT results,the patients were divided into 3 groups: 1- H.pylori positive patients who underwent standard triple therapy. 2- ITPpatients negative for H.pylori and 3- ITP patients positive for H.pylori, but without eradication therapy. Evaluation of the H.pylori eradication was done 4 weeks after the treatment and also at the end of month 6. Results 52(61.2%) of patients were female and 33(38.8%) were male with mean age of 34.8\u00b112.2 years. There was nosignificant difference between the mean age and sex in different groups. No significant difference was seen in mean platelet count at the baseline among the groups, but there was a significant statistical difference in mean platelet betweenthe groups at the end of the first month. However, a significant difference was not seen in mean platelet count in months 2to 6. Chronicity in the first group was less than the 3rd group which statistically was significant. Also, the chronicity rate in non-infected ITP patients was lower than the H.pylori positive patients (P=0.03). Summary / Conclusion Our results show that eradication of H.pylori can reduce the chronicity rate in adult patients with acute ITP. Further studies on larger number of patients with longer follow-up are recommended. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
