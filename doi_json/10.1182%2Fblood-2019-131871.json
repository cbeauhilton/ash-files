    "abstract_text": "MiRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that control gene expression by binding to cognate sites in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032 UTR) of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). MiRNAs are transcribed as primary (pri) mRNAs and processed into precursor (pre) miRNAs by nuclear DROSHA before being exported into the cytoplasm via the Exportin 5 (XPO5)/RAN-GTP complex. Once in the cytoplasm, pre-miRNAs are further processed by Dicer into mature miRNAs. The FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) is one of the most common mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and confers growth and survival advantages to leukemia blasts. Among miRNAs, miR-155 has emerged as one of the most significantly upregulated in the FLT3-ITD+ AML and has been shown to play a pivotal role in uncontrolled blast hyperproliferation and survival. Herein, we report a previously unrecognized activity of FLT3-ITD that leads to deregulation of miR-155 expression by providing the evidence for the existence of FLT3-dependent non-canonical mechanisms of miRNA biogenesis. We initially observed that FLT3-ITD blocked the biogenesis of intronic miRNAs via inhibition of the \"gatekeeper\" XPO5/RAN-GTP complex that allow nucleus-to-cytoplasm pre-miRNA transport. By using in vitro phosphorylation assay with [ 32 P]-ATP labeling, we demonstrated that FLT3-ITD phosphorylates a Sprouty related EVH1 domain-containing protein 1 (SPRED1), and that phospho-SPRED1 in turn inhibited the XPO5/RAN-GTP complex thereby halting transportation of pre-miRNAs from the nucleus to cytoplasm. This resulted in a decrease of several intronic miRNAs involved in normal hematopoiesis (i.e., miR-29b, miR-181a, miR-146b, miR-126). Accordingly, knocking down of SPRED1 expression in FLT3-ITD+ AML cells resulted in increased production of mature intronic miRNAs. Since the XPO5/RAN-GTP complex is the main gatekeeper for miRNA biogenesis, these results appeared in contradiction with the miR-155 upregulation which has been invariably observed in FLT3-ITD+ AML blasts. Differently from intronic miRNAs, miR-155 is hosted at the genomic site of long non-coding RNA (lnc-RNA) and we therefore hypothesized that it follows a different path of biogenesis. In fact forced expression of FLT3-ITD in lin-Sca1+kit+ (LSK) cells decreased intronic miRNA biogenesis (i.e., miR-126) and increase production of lnc-RNA hosted miRNAs (i.e., miR-155). Accordingly, we demonstrated that upon FLT3-ITD activation, AKT phosphorylated DDX3X, a DEAD-box RNA helicase protein thereby reducing its ability to bind heterogeneous nuclear Ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U), a component of the hnRNP complex associated with pre-mRNA splicing. Consequently, in FLT3-ITD cells, BIC-155 splicing is decreased. In fact, we measured significant increased levels of phospho-DDX3X and unspliced BIC-155 in primary FLT3-ITD+ blasts compared with FLT3-ITD- AML blasts. In consistent, DDX3X knock-down (KO) in FLT3-ITD- cells decreased BIC-155 splicing whereas DDX3X re-expression reversed these effects. The excess of unspliced BIC-155 RNA then bound to nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1), a shuttle protein that transports poly A+ RNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In consistent, NXF1 KO blocked unspliced BIC-155 nucleus-to-cytoplasm transportation. In FLT3-ITD+ blasts, once in the cytoplasm, the unspliced BIC-155 RNA was then processed by cytoplasmic isoforms of DROSHA, as demonstrated using immunostaining, RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP), and other gain- and loss-of-function experiments. Furthermore, overexpression of cytoplasmic DROSHA but not nuclear DROSHA isoform increased the processing of unspliced BIC-155 to mature miR-155. None of the intronic miRNAs studies interacted with cytoplasmic DROSHA. The bound of BIC-155 RNA with cytoplasmic DROSHA was unique of FLT3-ITD+ blasts, as it was not observed in FLT3-ITD- blasts. Thus, our results indicate a two-fold activity of FLT3-ITD that leads to decreased levels of intronic miRNAs via XPO5/RAN-GTP blockage and upregulation of other lnc-RNA hosted miRNAs via cytoplasmic DROSHA activation. The net result is suppression of intronic miRNAs that participates to the regulation of normal hematopoiesis and upregulation of lnc-RNA-hosted miRNA, especially miR-155 that contribute to aberrant blast hyperproliferation in the FLT3-ITD AML phenotype (Figure 1).
