Studies in BCR-ABL positive cell lines have shown that BCR-ABL promotes proteasomal degradation of p27 in a pathway that involves the SCF SKP2 ubiquitin ligase, while cytoplasmic mislocalization has been described in primary CML cells. It has been suggested that the principal effect of this cytoplasmic mislocalization is to remove p27 from the nucleus, thereby relieving Cdks from p27 inhibition. However, recent studies have shown that a p27 mutant (p27 CK- ), that cannot bind to Cdks or Cyclins, actively contributes to oncogenesis. This raises the question as to whether cytoplasmic mislocalization of p27 in CML cells may in fact promote leukemogenesis rather than merely compromise Cdk inhibition. We therefore hypothesized that the net contribution of p27 in CML is to promote leukemogenesis due to the oncogenic activity of cytoplasmic p27 . Experimental approach and results: We determined p27 localization in BCR-ABL positive cell lines and CD34+ progenitor cells from newly diagnosed chronic phase CML patients (N=7) and from CML patients in blast crisis (N=2) by immunoblotting of nuclear and cytoplasmic cellular fractions. We found that p27 is predominantly cytoplasmic in most CML cell lines and in CD34+ cells from 8/9 (89%) patient samples, including patients in blastic phase. Cytoplasmic localization of p27 in CD34+ cells from CML patients was also confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis. Further, we observed that inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase by imatinib, an Abl kinase inhibitor increased nuclear p27 in all cell lines tested and in 4/9 patient samples (3/7 chronic phase and 1/2 blastic phase samples). However, we did not observe a substantial change in the cytoplasmic p27 levels. Similar results were obtained in Ba/F3 and 32D murine hematopoietic cell lines expressing BCR-ABL when compared with the respective parental cells. Further, SKP2 was up-regulated in CD34+ cell from CML patients as compared to the normal patients consistent withSKP2 mediated down-regulation of nuclear p27. These data suggest that nuclear but not cytoplasmic p27 levels are predominantly regulated by BCR-ABL kinase activity. To test whether p27 is crucial for BCR-ABL-driven leukemia, we compared leukemogenesis between recipients of BCR-ABL transduced p27 +/+ and p27 -/- bone marrow. Mice transplanted with BCR-ABL infected p27-/- marrow had significantly longer median survival (70 days, range 48-150 days) compared to recipients of p27+/+ marrow (37 days, range 14-56 days) (p=0.0123). To exclude that this difference was related to the differences in homing and engraftment capabilities of p27+/+ and p27-/- bone marrow cells, we compared short term homing and long term engraftment of p27+/+ and p27-/- bone marrow cells transplanted into wild-type recipients and found no differences. These data suggest that the net contribution of p27 to BCR-ABL-mediated leukemogenesis is positive. Further, to investigate the contribution of nuclear p27 to leukemogenesis, we utilized marrow from p27 S10A mice in the murine CML model. In p27 S10A mice, p27 is nuclear to to abrogation of the phosphorylation site implicated in nuclear export. We injected BCR-ABL transduced bone marrow cells of p27 S10A and p27 +/+ mice into wild-type recipients and compared the disease progression. We observed that mice transplanted with BCR-ABL infected p27 S10A marrow had significantly longer median survival (28 days, range 23-79 days) compared to the recipients of p27+/+ marrow (23 days, range 21-38 days) (p=0.0139). This data is consistent with nuclear tumor suppressor function of p27. Combined with the data above, this suggests that cytoplasmic p27 promotes BCR-ABL mediated leukemogenesis. Conclusions: Our data suggest that though nuclear p27 functions as a tumor suppressor, the net contribution of p27 in CML might be oncogenic due to an oncogenic role of the increased cytoplasmic p27. Restoring nuclear p27 or reducing cytoplasmic p27 may be therapeutically useful in malignancies with low nuclear and high cytoplasmic p27 expression.
