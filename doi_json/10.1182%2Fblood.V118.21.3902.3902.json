    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3902 Chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) is highly effective treatment and standard of care for patients (pts) with CLL. Response to treatment by NCI-WG/IWCLL criteria correlates with outcome; pts who achieve complete remission (CR) have superior progression-free and overall survival compared to pts who achieve partial remission (PR); and pts who fail therapy have the poorest outcome. Emerging data indicate improved outcomes for pts who achieve minimal residual disease (MRD)-free status in blood or bone marrow (BM) by end of treatment. We are conducting a clinical trial to prospectively evaluate pretreatment pt characteristics and prognostic factors and correlations with NCI-WG response, MRD-free status, and time to event outcomes with standard frontline fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) CIT. A total of 197 pts have been registered, 160 have completed treatment and are evaluable for response by NCI-WG criteria, and 127 have BM MRD status evaluated by standard 4-color flow cytometry at Course 3 and/or end of treatment. We report on pretreatment characteristics associated with MRD-free status at end of treatment. For the 160 pts evaluable for response by NCI-WG criteria, 63% were male; the median (range) age, \u03b22M, and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) were 58 yrs (38\u201384), 3.6 mg/l (1.3\u201314.1), and 78.7 K/\u03bcl (.8\u2013394), respectively. The percent pts with Rai high-risk disease, unmutated IGHV status, ZAP70 + by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and CD38 + (30% cutoff) was 35%, 60%, 63%, and 37%, respectively. According to the hierarchical categorization, FISH demonstrated 17p del in 9%, 11q del in 18%, +12 in 17%, 13q del in 36%, and no abnormality in 20% of pts. The median number of FCR courses given was 6; 57% received all intended 6, 21% received 4\u20135, and 23% received \u22643. Of the 160 pts, 63% achieved CR, 12% nodular PR (nPR), 23% PR and 3% did not respond. Of 127 pts with BM evaluated by 4-color flow cytometry at end of treatment, 56% were MRD-free. Of 71 MRD-free pts, 27 were negative at end of course 3, 33 converted to negative after course 3, and 11 were negative at end of treatment but did not have a course 3 evaluation. Univariable Chi-square analyses demonstrated pretreatment \u03b22M, IGHV mutation status, 17p del, and +12 correlated with MRD-free status at end of treatment (Table). The following did not correlate: age, Rai stage, WBC, ALC, HGB, PLT, ZAP70, CD38, or number of FCR courses received. Multivariable logistic regression model identified \u03b22M\u22654 mg/l (odds ratio=.78; p=.007) and unmutated IGHV (odds ratio=.77; p=.006) as independently associated with lower likelihood to achieve MRD-free status. In conclusion, mutated IGHV and \u03b22M <4 mg/l are independently associated with increased likelihood of achieving MRD-free status with frontline FCR CIT; further follow up is needed to correlate MRD-free status with improved survival outcomes for patients treated on this trial.
