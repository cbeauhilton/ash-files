It is important to continue to investigate new therapeutic agents based on the biology of MM cells. \u03b2-catenin is the downstream effector of Wnt signaling and it regulates genes implicated in malignant progression. We have demonstrated that blockade of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway inhibits the progression of MM by using RNA interference methods with an in vivo mouse model (Ashihara E, et al. Clin Cancer Res 15:2731, 2009.). In this study, we investigated the effects of AV-65, a novel inhibitor of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, on MM cells. The system to identify a series of small molecule compounds using a biomarker driven approach has been established. A gene expression biomarker signature reporting on the inhibition of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling was generated upon treatment of a colon cancer cell line with \u03b2-catenin siRNA. This gene expression signatiure was used to screen a small molecule compound library to identify compounds which mimic knockdown of \u03b2-catenin and thus potentially inhibit the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. One compound series, LC-363, was discovered from this screen and validated as novel Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling inhibitors (Strovel JW, et al. ASH meeting, 2007.). We investigated the inhibitory effects of AV-65, one of LC-363 compounds, on MM cell proliferation. AV-65 inhibited the proliferation of MM cells in a time- and a dose-dependent manner and the values of IC 50 at 72 hrs were ranging from 11.7 to 82.1 nM. AV-65 also showed an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of RPMI8226/LR-5 melphalan-resistant MM cells (provided from Dr. William S. Dalton). In flow cytometric analysis, apoptotic cells were increased by AV-65 treatment in a time- and a dose-dependent manner. Western blotting analysis showed that \u03b2-catenin was ubiquitinated and that the expression of nuclear \u03b2-catenin diminished ( Figure 1 ). Moreover, AV-65 suppressed T-cell factor transcriptional activities, resulting in the decrease of c-myc expression. Taken together, AV-65 promotes the degradation of \u03b2-catenin, resulting in the induction of apoptosis of MM cells. We next investigated the in vivo effects of AV-65 using an orthotopic MM-bearing mouse model. AV-65 inhibits the growth of MM cells and significantly prolongs the survival rates (Figure 2). In conclusion, AV-65 inhibited the proliferation of MM cells via inhibition of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. AV-65 is a promising therapeutic agent for treatment of MM.
