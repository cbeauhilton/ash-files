    "abstract_text": "The large number of experimental approaches, culture conditions, qualitative and quantitative methods, and in vitro and in vivo models employed so far to assess immune regulatory properties of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) has led to an excess of literature data that sometimes are poorly comparable, redundant, and even contradictory. Thus, quite paradoxically, the risk is that pre-clinical literature data may become eventually weak and scarcely useful, in both researchers\u2019 and Regulatory Authorities\u2019 opinion, for supporting experimentally specific MSC-based clinical trials aimed at treating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, some data in this field appear more solid and reproducible and may be generally accepted to suggest reproducible immunological assays to quantify the differences in immune modulatory properties of MSCs produced according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). The MSC Committee of the International Society of Cell Therapy (ISCT) released a statement paper in 2006 that established the minimal criteria characterizing human MSC, without focusing particularly on their immunological properties. In the 7 years following the publication of this statement paper, more than 10,000 manuscripts on MSC, and many of them deal with immune regulation. To consolidate the scientific research in this field, the MSC Committee of the ISCT is publishing a working proposal paper aimed at stimulating the general discussion about the need of shared guidelines for the immunological characterization of MSCs for clinical use: 1. A standard immune plasticity assay should be implemented by using IFN-\u03b3 + TNF-\u03b1 as model in vitro priming agent 2. Functional analysis of an expanded cell product may provide mechanistic insights on intra- and inter- study variance in clinical response amongst patients 3. The use of purified responders would be widely practicable and should provide more generalizable guidance on relative functional potency of MSC and as a companion to clinical trials 4. Interrogating the IDO response as part of an in vitro licensing assay should be considered central 5. Conclusions based on xenorecipient animal models on how to conduct clinical trials should be drawn with caution 6. The prospective hypothesis-driven analysis of lymphocyte populations in patients groups treated with MSC should be encouraged 7. Clinical analysis should also include the monitoring of whether injected MSCs are the target of an immune response. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
