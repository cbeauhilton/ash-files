    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND Surprisingly, some patients who reject donor marrow grafts following nonmyeloablative HCT sustain remissions of advanced hematologic malignancies ( Br J Haematol  2005 , 128 : 351 ). In murine mixed chimeras prepared with nonmyeloablative conditioning, we previously showed that recipient leukocyte infusions (RLI) induced loss of donor chimerism and anti-tumor responses against host-type tumors ( Blood  2003 , 102 : 2300 ) and that both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are necessary to achieve maximum anti-tumor effects ( J Immunol  2005 , 175 : 665 ). We now examined whether or not NK and/or NKT cells are required in the anti-tumor effect. METHODS Mixed chimerism was achieved in BALB/c (H-2 d ) mice conditioned with depleting anti-CD4 and CD8 mAbs on Day -5, cyclophosphamide 200 mg/kg on Day -1 and 7 Gy thymic irradiation on Day 0 prior to transplantation of 25x10 6 B10.BR (H-2 k ) or B10.RIII (H-2 r ) bone marrow cells. Some groups received RLI (3x10 7 BALB/c spleen cells) seven weeks post-BMT. A20 cells (5x10 5 ) were given i.v. one week after RLI. Some groups included J\u03b1281-deficient BALB/c (J\u03b1281 KO) mice that lack invariant NKT (iNKT) cells or NK1.1 + BALB/c mice whose NK and NKT cells can be depleted by anti-NK1.1 Ab, PK136. Some groups received a depleting dose of anti-NK1.1 antibody before and after RLI administration. RESULTS Untreated recipients of NK1.1-depleted RLI (n=9) showed similar tumor survival compared to recipients of NK1.1-sufficient RLI (n=9) (median survival time [MST] 52 versus 52 days respectively, p=0.68). NK1.1-depleted (with mAb in vivo) chimeras that received RLI (n=8) had shorter survival (MST 35.5 days) than NK1.1-sufficient chimeras that received RLI (n=10) (MST 68 days, P<0.01) and no anti-tumor effect was observed in the depleted group. J\u03b1281 KO chimeric recipients receiving with J\u03b1281 KO-derived RLI (n=12) had shorter survival than wild-type chimeric mice receiving wild-type RLI (n=11) (MST 41.0 vs 67.0 days, p<0.01) and no survival benefit of RLI was observed in J\u03b1281 KO recipients (p=0.93). CONCLUSION When NK and NKT cells were depleted from NK1.1 + BALB/c recipients, no anti-tumor effect was observed. In contrast, no reduction in anti-tumor effect was observed in chimeras given NK1.1-depleted RLI. Invariant NKT cells are required to achieve anti-tumor effects in this model. Therefore, NKT cells and possibly NK cells in the recipient are essential for the anti-tumor effect of RLI, but NK and NKT cells in the RLI do not play a role. The requirement for both T cells and NK/NKT cells suggests an essential interaction between the innate and acquired immune systems."
