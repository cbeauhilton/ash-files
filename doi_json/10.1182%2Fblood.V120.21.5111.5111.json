    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5111 Purpose We aimed to evaluate the clinicopathologic characteristics and clinical outcomes in patients with testicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Material and Methods We reviewed the medical records of 24 patients with testicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed at the Asan Medical Center between November, 2000 and June, 2012. Results Median age of the patients was 52 years (23\u201379 years). Histopathologic subtypes were as follows: DLBCL (n=18, 75%), Burkitt's lymphoma (n=2, 8. 3%), extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) (n=2, 8. 3%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (n=1, 4. 2%) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) (n=1, 4. 2%). Ten patients (41. 7%) were in stage I, 1 patient (4. 2%) in stage II, and the other 13 patients (54. 2%) were in stage IV. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) was 1 in 22 patients (87. 5%) and >1 in 5 patients (20. 8%). Serum LDH levels were elevated in 14 patients (58. 3%). International Prognostic index (IPI) score was low (0\u20131) in 6 patients (25%), low-intermediate (2) in 8 patients (33. 3%), high-intermediate (3) in 7 patients (29. 2%), high (4\u20135) in 3 patients (12. 5%). B-symptoms were present in 4 patients (16. 7%). Bilateral testicular involvement was observed in 5 patients (20. 8%). Fifteen patients (62. 5%) underwent orchiectomy as an initial therapeutic and diagnostic procedure. All the patients underwent chemotherapy: R-CHOP (n=16, 66. 6%), CHOP (n=2, 8. 3%), and other regimens (n=6, 25%). None received intrathecal prophylaxis just except a T-LBL patient. Prophylactic radiotherapy to contralateral testis was given in 12 patients (50%). Twenty-one patients (87. 5%) achieved complete response. At a median follow-up duration of 22 months (1\u2013139 months), 2 patients (8. 3%) showed disease progression and 7 patients (29. 2%) experienced disease recurrence; in the central nervous system (n=2, 8. 3%), regional lymph nodes (n=3, 12. 5%), bone marrow (n=1, 4. 2%), nasopharynx (n=1), skin (n=1), and testicular bed (n=1). Five patients (20. 8%) died of sepsis (n=3, 12. 5%) or progression of disease (n=2, 8. 3%). Median progression free survival and overall survival were 20 months (1\u2013139 months) and 22 months (1\u2013139 months), respectively. ECOG PS >1 (p=0. 015) and bilateral testicular involvement (p=0. 000) were associated with a significantly short progression free survival (PFS). ECOG PS >1 (p=0. 001), high-intermediate or high risk of IPI (p=0. 010), presence of B symptoms (p=0. 035), and bilateral testicular involvement (p=0. 001) were associated with a significantly short overall survival. Conclusions Testicular lymphoma is a rare but aggressive extranodal lymphoma. High ECOG PS, high IPI, B symptom, and bilateral testicular involvement were associated with poor prognosis. Table 1.
