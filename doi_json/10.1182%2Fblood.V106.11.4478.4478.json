    "abstract_text": "A SYBR Green I real-time quantitative RT-PCR method was established for investigating the correlation between CML28 mRNA expressing levels and relapse of leukemia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). pcDNA3.1HisA-CML28 plasmid had been constructed as the standard template. Serial monitorting of CML28 mRNA levels by SYBR Green I real-time quantitative RT-PCR technique was performed in 14 patients, including 10 patients with CML and 3 patients with AML, 1 patient with Ph + ALL. The sensitivity of the established method was at 10 \u22124 level, with interassay variation and intraassay variation of standard samples both < 10%. The CML28 was highly expressed in AML and CML-BP or AP. In newly diagnosed group, CML28 was (6.58\u00b12.34)\u00d710 \u22122 . In pre-conditioning regimen group was (2.19\u00b10.32)\u00d710 \u22122 , in group that 1 month after allo-HSCT was (1.35\u00b11.28)\u00d710 \u22122 , in group that 3 months after allo-HSCT was (4.57\u00b16.39)\u00d710 \u22123 . CML28 can be detected 3months after HSCT in 1 patient with CML-CP and 3 patients with CML-AP or BC. 2 of them with low level (<2\u00d710 \u22122 ) survived without relapse, the other 2 patients with high level (>2\u00d710 \u22122 ) relapsed within one year,1 died and1 received the second time allo-HSCT, CML28 level decreased rapidly after HSCT, but still higher than 2\u00d710 \u22122 and relapsed again. CML28 mRNA level was obviously correlated with the development of diseases. Serial quantification of CML28 mRNA levels were necessary for allo-HSCT recipients, and more informative than a single detection. Use of this assay to evaluate MRD in the patients performed allo-HSCT was helpful for predicition of relapse."
