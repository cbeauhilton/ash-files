Women with thrombophilic mutations (factor V leiden, prothrombin, and MTHFR) and inherited bleeding disorders, such as deficiency of factor XIII and fibrinogen, have been shown to be at increased risk of pregnancy loss. However, the risk of miscarriage in women with other inherited bleeding disorders has been discussed controversially. Due to the lack of data, it cannot be determined if the risk of miscarriage is increased in women with von Willebrand disease (vWD). The aim of our study was to clarify the association between inherited bleeding disorders and pregnancy loss. Patients and Methods: Subjects Concerning this investigation we included 91 female patients with two [n=46] or more [n=45] miscarriages occurring prior to 28 weeks of gestation and/or stillbirth without apparent reason. The median age of the examined group at the time of first fetal loss was 29 years, ranging from 17 to 41 years. Methods At first we compiled a detailed clinical history of bleedings of all patients. Subsequently, we performed various tests to gather information regarding coagulation abnormalities and thrombophilic defects. Therefore a molecular and functional assessment of the following data was performed: Coagulation factors, vWF:Ag, vWF:RCo, phospholipid antibodies, hyperhomocysteinaemia (HHCY), protein S (PS), protein C (PC), antithrombin (AT) and FV-Leiden mutation (G1691A), FII mutation (G20210A) and MTHFR C677T. Results: In our investigated population consisting of 91 women we registered 299 pregnancies of which 240 resulted in fetal loss, 232 prior to week 28 of pregnancy and 8 stillbirths. Seven out of 91 patients (8%) were carriers of inherited coagulation disorders; vWD: n=2 (2%), FVII deficiency: n=3 (3%), thrombocytopathy: n=2 (2%). In our study collective there was no increased rate of patients with vWD. None of the patients showed a FXIII- or fibrinogen deficiency. However, 17 patients (19%) have a bleeding diathesis. In 55 patients (60%) we could detect the following thrombophilic defects: FV-Leiden (G1691A): n=10, MTHFR C677T: n=42, PS: n=1, PC: n=1, APS: n=1. Conclusion: The incidence of vWD patients in our miscarriage collective is the same as the overall incidence of vWD patients in the general population. Therefore vWD is not associated with an increased risk of fetal loss. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
