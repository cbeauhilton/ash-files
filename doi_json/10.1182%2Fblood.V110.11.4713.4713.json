    "abstract_text": "Before the introduction of Alemtuzumab, the prognosis of fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was very poor. This humanised anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody was found to be effective in CLL patients with additional high-risk prognostic markers. In our case report, we present the courses of treatment with Alemtuzumab in a CLL patient with del q11, elevated ZAP-70 and CD38 levels. He was first admitted to our department because of CLL in 1996. He received high dose Chlorambucil, later fludarabine courses between 1996\u20132002. Because of early disease progression five courses of Alemtuzumab were administered between 2003\u20132007. The treatment resulting nodal partial remission lasting about 10\u201311 months. No CTC 3\u20134 grade side effects were registered, nor hospitalization was necessary. The patient responded favorably to each course of repeated therapy with single agent Alemtuzumab, suggesting, that Alemtuzumab retraitment is the choice of therapy for fludarabine refractory CLL patients."
