    "abstract_text": "Introduction Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have changed the natural course of CML. Their efficacy leads to normal life expectancy in the vast majority of patients. With the advent of 2nd generation TKI and the now available choice of drugs, safety issues have gained interest. We have used the randomized CML-Study IV for a long-term safety evaluation of imatinib. Study and Patients CML-Study IV comprises 1551 patients randomized to 5 treatment arms with 3 imatinib-based combinations and 2 different imatinib-dose schedules. 1501 patients have received imatinib and were evaluable. Median age at diagnosis was 53 years, 88% were EUTOS low risk. At the last evaluation (04/11/2013) 1003 patients still received imatinib, 164 had died, 275 were switched to a 2nd generation TKI, 106 were transplanted. The longest observation time was 11.5 years, the median observation time was 6.5 years, with a 10-year survival probability of 84 %. The median time to imatinib discontinuation has not been reached after 10.2 years. 80 patients are under observation for more than 10 years, 18 of these have discontinued imatinib. Out of the 1501 patients that had received imatinib, 1375 patients received imatinib as first-line treatment and had a sufficient documentation of treatment. Methods AE were reported at each follow-up visit. The CTC AE list of the NCI was used for coding of AE and severity grading. Additionally, for detection of hematologic AE lab results were screened for deviations from reference ranges. The AE were analyzed according to the \u201cas treated\u201d principle, using Kaplan-Meier curves (virtually no competing risks, almost all patients died after end of imatinib treatment). Only the first event of the respective type was considered. All analyses started at the first day of imatinib treatment and were censored when the patient discontinued imatinib, received another treatment or died. To assess the differences between men and women, Cox models were estimated. Results In 1137 out of 1375 patients (83%) non-hematologic AE (5160 singular events) were reported during imatinib treatment (all grades), in 322 grade 3/4 AE (23%) (645 singular events). At 3 years, probability of a non-hematologic AE (any grade) was already 76% (95%-CI: 73-79%), at 6 years 85% (95%-CI: 82-88%) and at 8 years 91% ( Fig.1 ). The probability of grade 3/4 non-haematologic AE was 38% (95%-CI: 34-42%) at 6 years and 43% (CI: 37-48%) at 8 years.

The most frequently reported non-hematologic AE (all grades, any time) were gastrointestinal (6-year-probability 52%, 95%-CI: 48-56%), fluid overload or edema (6y-prob. 45%, 95%-CI: 40-49%), rash (6y-prob. 32%, 95%-CI: 28-36%), myalgia or arthralgia (6y-prob. 30%, 95%-CI: 27-34%), fatigue (6y-prob. 26%, 95%-CI: 22-29%), flu-like symptoms (6y-prob. 22%, 95%-CI: 19-26%), infections (6y-prob. 24%, 95%-CI: 20-28%) and neurological symptoms (6y-prob. 26%, 95%-CI: 22-29%). AE probability profiles over time have been generated for each AE ( Figs. 2 - 3 ). For women the risk for non-hematologic events was increased 1.35-fold (95% CI: 1.18-1.55) for all grades ( Figs. 1 - 3 ) and 1.13-fold (95% CI: 0.91-1.41) for grade 3/4, and 1.26-fold (95% CI: 0.91-1.71) for grade 3/4 hematologic AE.

A definite association between any AE and death was not found. Conclusion As AE by definition may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment an exact assessment of the safety of imatinib is difficult. Most AE were recorded during the first three years with decreasing frequency later on. The increased AE risk in women was mostly grade 1/2 and is commonly seen also in other treatment areas. Given that no imatinib-related death was recorded and that grade 3/4 AE could typically be properly treated we consider imatinib as a safe, comparably well tolerated TKI even after prolonged treatment. After 10 years imatinib continues to be an excellent choice for the treatment of CML in most patients. Disclosures: Hehlmann: Novartis: Research Funding; BMS: Consultancy, Research Funding.
