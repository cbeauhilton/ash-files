    "abstract_text": "Abstract 729 Introduction: The prognosis of primary plasma cell leukemia (PPCL) remains poor. The \u201cnovel agents\u201d have recently shown promising results in PPCL patients in case reports or small retrospective series. Here we describe the first prospective, multicenter, phase II clinical trial of PPCL, where lenalidomide in combination with low dose dexamethasone (Ld) was tested as initial therapy in newly diagnosed patients fulfilling the IMWG diagnostic criteria of PPCL. Patients and methods: Ld regimen consisted of lenalidomide 25 mg/d for 21 days and oral dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for each 28-day cycle. After 4 cycles, responding patients not eligible for stem cell transplantation (SCT) continued until 8 cycles of full-dose Ld, followed by a maintenance dose of single agent lenalidomide equal to 10 mg/d on days 1\u201321 of each 28-day cycle. Patients responding after 4 cycles and eligible for SCT proceeded according to the treatment centre's transplant policy. Patients not responding after 4 cycles or progressing during this treatment were considered off-study. Appropriate dose reductions (in particular for patients with reduced renal function at baseline), double contraception methods and anti-thrombotic/anti-infective prophylaxis were recommended. The primary end-point was early response rate according to IMWG uniform response criteria. Secondary end-points were PFS, OS, feasibility and efficacy of SCT, safety. Results: According to the Simon optimal two-stage adaptive design, twenty-three patients were enrolled in between March 2009 and May 2011. The male/female ratio was 1.1, and median age was 60 years (range 44\u201380). The median absolute number and percentage of circulating plasma cells were 4.280/\u03bcl (range 1.500\u2013114.660) and 34% (range 21\u201390) respectively. Fifteen patients (65.2%) had abnormal renal function at presentation. Twenty-one patients (91.3%) were tested by FISH analysis and cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in all of them, del13q being the most frequently found (16 patients). Seventeen patients showed multiple chromosomal lesions. Involvement of chromosome 14 was observed in 18 patients, three of whom showed t(4;14). Chromosome 1q gain and del17p were detected in 10 and 7 patients, respectively. In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, overall response rate (ORR) after at least one Ld cycle was 73.9% (17/23), with 8 patients (34.7%) achieving partial remission (PR), 5 (21.7%) very good PR (VGPR), 3 (13%) complete response (CR), and 1(4.3%) near CR (nCR) (VGPR or better: 39%). In the efficacy-evaluable (EE) population, 14 out of 15 patients who received the initially planned 4 Ld cycles (65.2% of the ITT population) responded (ORR 93.3%), achieving 5 PR (33.3%), 5 VGPR (33.3%), 1 near-CR (6.6%) and 3 CR (20%) (VGPR or better: 59.9%). The maintenance phase was reached and safely performed in 4 responding patients not eligible for SCT, 3 of whom relapsed after 2, 8 and 22 months, respectively. After Ld induction therapy, 8 patients received single (n. 4) or double (n. 4) autologous SCT (ASCT); another patient underwent a sequence of ASCT followed by non-myeloablative allogeneic SCT (AlloSCT). Six eligible patients did not receive ASCT frontline, due to initial Ld failure or adverse events; three of them underwent single ASCT (n. 2) or tandem ASCT/non-myeloablative AlloSCT (n. 1) after a bortezomib-based salvage therapy, achieving 2 CR and 1 PR. After a median follow-up of 23 months, median OS and PFS in ITT population were not reached and 22 months, respectively. All transplanted patients remained alive, although three of them relapsed and started salvage treatments; OS was 12 months in the 11 patients who did not receive ASCT (p < 0.001). The correspondent figures for PFS were 29 and 16 months, respectively (p < 0.01). Considering ITT population, multivariate analyses showed that SCT was positively correlated to both OS and PFS. There were 17 episodes of grade 3/4 non hematological toxicity, which occurred in 13 patients (5 infections, 3 renal, 3 metabolic, 2 gastro-intestinal, 2 skin, 1 fatigue, 1 thromboembolic), causing early interruption of Ld treatment in 4 patients. Grade 3/4 hematological toxicity (mainly neutropenia) occurred in 11 patients (47.8%). Conclusions: Ld may be a feasible and effective initial therapeutic option for PPCL, particularly in patients who receive ASCT after a short course of induction treatment.
