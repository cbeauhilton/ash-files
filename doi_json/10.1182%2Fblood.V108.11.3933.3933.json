    "abstract_text": "The endothelial surface protein thrombomodulin (TM) generates activated protein C (aPC) that protects from sepsis-related DIC, vascular inflammation, and apoptosis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a novel recombinant mouse soluble TM (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) in a murine lethal endotoxin (LPS) sepsis model to determine both kinetic and survival endpoints. A dose effective in rodent reperfusion studies was employed in this sepsis model (D. Berg, Eli Lilly). C57BL6 mice were injected concomitantly with rmsTM 5 mg/kg (s.c.) and LPS 14 ug/g (i.p.) at time zero. Plasma concentrations were determined from citrated plasma at 3, 12, 24, and 48 hr, and plasma rmsTM concentrations were determined by ELISA. In vitro determinations of mouse aPC amidolytic activity and rmsTM dependent fibrinogen clotting time assays utilized rmsTM, murine thrombin, fibrinogen, and Protein C (Enzyme Research Labs). The in-vivo time-dependent mouse plasma kinetic studies confirmed plasma concentrations comparable to that achieved in human sTM antithrombotic studies. Thus, an rmsTM dose of 5 mg/kg was chosen for the 7-day LPS survival study (20% survival model). Twenty age-and weight-matched male C57BL6 mice, age 8\u201314 weeks, were treated with LPS 14 ug/g or LPS and rmsTM, 5 mg/kg, s.c. Survival curves were analyzed by Wilcoxon rank sum test (power 80%, alpha 2.5, p<0.05). An initial time course after rmsTM s.c. injection yielded a peak plasma rmsTM level at 3 hr (5,000 ng/mL) which persisted up to 48 hr (2,000 ng/mL). In vitro activation of aPC was saturating (2,000 ng/mL aPC with <20 ng/mL rmsTM). Prolongation of the thrombin clot time occurred at approximately 10 ug/ml of rmsTM. The LPS survival study in C57BL6 administered LPS (14 ug/g, i.p.) or LPS and rmsTM 5mg/kg s.c. demonstrated no survival difference (P=0.63). In vitro evaluation of aPC generation by rmsTM yielded ample amounts of aPC. Similarly, reduction of thrombin activity by rmsTM occurred at higher rmsTM concentrations. Thus, the lack of survival difference seen between endotoxemic mice treated with saline or adjunctive rmsTM in this model may be from the lack of thrombin inhibition, the lack of persistent (rmsTM:Thrombin) PC activation, or by more efficient clearance of aPC. Species specificity of TM is less likely a contributing factor. Further elucidation of the murine thrombin/thrombomodulin regulatory mechanism in vivo may be necessary to help explain our unexpected sTM survival results.",
