    "abstract_text": "In Oz, the yellow brick road led to dreams come true. In platelets, the road from agonist receptors to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 leads to thrombus formation, a response necessary for hemostasis and thrombosis. Upon platelet stimulation, agonist receptor pathways converge on the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of \u03b1IIb\u03b23, causing conformational changes that are propagated to the extracellular domain to effect high affinity ligand binding (activation). Numerous intracellular proteins have been implicated in\u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation, including protein kinase C (PKC), the Rap1 GTPase and talin. Indeed, talin recruitment to the \u03b23 cytoplasmic domain is a final common step in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation. However, the relationships of these signaling proteins to each other, and the mechanism(s) of talin recruitment to \u03b23 have not been established. Here we used forward, reverse, and synthetic genetics to engineer and order an \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation pathway. In a CHO cell model system, increased expression of PKC\u03b1and talin to levels approximating those in platelets reconstituted \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation in response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). This response was detectable by monitoring fibrinogen binding or the binding of a monovalent, ligand-mimetic antibody Fab fragment (PAC-1 Fab) that is specific for high-affinity \u03b1IIb\u03b23. PMA-induced activation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 could be blocked by over-expression of Rap1GAP, which inhibits Rap1 GTPase activity. In contrast, over-expression of constitutively-active Rap1A(G12V) caused \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation that bypassed the requirement for PKC\u03b1, indicating that Rap1 is downstream of PKC\u03b1in this integrin activation pathway. \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation by Rap1 was promoted by a specific Rap1 effector, RIAM, an adapter molecule with a PH domain and proline-rich and EVH-1 binding regions. For example, over-expression of RIAM, but not another Rap1 effector (RapL), caused activation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and bypassed the requirement for PKC\u03b1and Rap1. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of RIAM blocked \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation by PMA or Rap1A(G12V), and this effect could be rescued by an siRNA-resistant form of RIAM. The integrin activating effects of PKC\u03b1, Rap1A(G12V) and RIAM were not observed if an integrin binding-defective talin mutant (W359A) was expressed instead of talin. In both CHO cells and platelets, activated Rap1 formed an integrin-associated complex with talin and RIAM, as assessed by deconvolution microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation. In addition, when RIAM was knocked down by siRNA in ES cell-derived murine megakaryocytes, \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation in response to ADP or thrombin receptor agonists was impaired. These results identify and order a signaling pathway from agonist stimulation to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation. At the end of this road, Rap1 organizes an integrin activating complex composed of RIAM and talin. The ability to synthetically reconstruct an \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation pathway and validate it in platelets and megakaryocytes now provides molecular targets to facilitate characterization of clinical platelet activation defects and development of better anti-platelet drugs.
