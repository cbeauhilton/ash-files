    "abstract_text": "2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2, Panzem \u00ae ) is an endogenous metabolite of estradiol with antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and antiangiogenic activity. Some of these activities are mediated through the downregulation of HIF1-\u03b1. Panzem \u00ae capsules have been evaluated in several oncology clinical trials, including multiple myeloma where some patients have been on therapy for more than 4 years with stable disease. A new formulation of 2ME2 with enhanced absorption, Panzem \u00ae NCD, is currently in Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies in oncology. In anticipation of combination studies with Panzem \u00ae NCD, we evaluated the effectiveness of 2ME2 alone or with the proteosome inhibitor, Velcade \u00ae (bortezomib), in the RPMI-8226 myeloma xenograft tumor model. Preliminary in vitro studies indicated significantly increased antiproliferative activity when 2ME2 (1.5\u03bcM) was combined with Velcade \u00ae (5nM) compared to Velcade \u00ae alone (p<0.05 ANOVA). Additionally, 2ME2 in combination with Velcade \u00ae also resulted in decreased nuclear NF\u03baB in response to TNF\u03b1, as compared to either agent alone. Subsequent to these studies, female CB17 SCID mice were injected subcutaneously with 1 x 10 6 RPMI-8226 tumor cells. Starting 10 days after tumor cell inoculation when mean tumor volume was approximately 100\u2013200 mm 3 , cohorts of mice (n=8/group) began treatment with (a) vehicle alone ad libitum in the drinking water; (b) 2ME2 300 mg/kg ad libitum in the drinking water; (c) Velcade \u00ae 1.5 mg/kg i.p., biw; or (d) 2ME2 (300 mg/kg) in combination with Velcade \u00ae (1.5 mg/kg). On study day 27, mean tumor volume in vehicle-treated, control mice was approximately 3400 mm 3 . Under these experimental conditions, treatment with either 2ME2 alone or Velcade \u00ae alone generated a treatment/control (T/C) value of 0.66 and 0.64, respectively. In comparison, 2ME2 in combination with Velcade \u00ae resulted in a T/C value of 0.35. Velcade \u00ae is a well recognized and commonly used antineoplastic agent in multiple myeloma. The degradation of HIF1-\u03b1 is accomplished through the proteosome. These studies demonstrate that a combination strategy using Velcade \u00ae and 2ME2 can enhance the antitumor effectiveness of either agent alone in the treatment of a xenograft model of human multiple myeloma.",
