    "abstract_text": "Alteration of the p53 gene is one of the most frequent events in human tumorigenesis and about 50% of all solid tumors have been reported to carry p53 mutations. The inactivation of p53 in cancer has been associated with poor survival, refractory disease and chemoresistance. p53 mutations rarely occur in hematopoietic malignancies. Instead, MDM2 which is a principal cellular antagonist of p53, is overexpressed in the majority of leukemias. Recently, potent and selective small-molecule antagonists of MDM2, Nutlins, have been identified ( Science  303 : 844 \u2013888, 2004 ). Nutlins bind MDM2 in the p53-binding pocket and activate the p53 pathway in human cancer cells with wild-type p53, leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and growth inhibition of human tumor xenografts in nude mice. In this study, we investigated the potential antileukemic activity of the MDM2 antagonist. Treatment of wild-type p53 OCI-AML-3 cells with 5 \u03bcM of an active compound (Nutlin-3a) induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis as evidenced by flow-cytometric analysis (51% reduction of S-phase at 12 h, 27% sub-G1 DNA content and 57% Annexin V positivity at 48 h). Similar proapoptotic effects were observed in MOLM-13 cells which have wild-type p53, but not in p53-null (HL-60 and U937) or mutant p53 (Raji, Jurkat and NB-4) cells. Nutlin-3a induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and induced maximal effect on cell cycle arrest at 1 \u03bcM. Western blot analysis showed that in OCI-AML-3 cells, wild-type p53 accumulated at 1 h after exposure to Nutlin-3a. Increased levels of MDM2, p21 and Noxa proteins were observed at 1 to 3h. This resulted in cleavage of caspase-9 followed by cleavage of caspase-3. A pharmacologic interaction study between MDM2 inhibitor and Ara-C using a fixed-ratio (1:1) experimental design showed highly synergistic cell growth inhibition (CI = 0.44) and induction of apoptosis (CI = 0.83) in OCI-AML-3 cells. Initial studies conducted in primary leukemia cells demonstrated that Nutlin-3a induced apoptosis in 4 of 5 AML samples tested (68\u201397% Annexin V induction and 65\u201393% cell number reduction) and 2 CLL samples (>50% Annexin V induction and 37% and 58% cell number reduction). Since MDM2 protein is overexpressed and p53 is not mutated in the majority of primary leukemia cells, this approach may have therapeutic utility in leukemias.",
