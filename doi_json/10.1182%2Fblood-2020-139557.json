    "abstract_text": "Background: In Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), identification of measurable residual disease (MRD) thresholds with clinical significance is still a matter of debate. For this purpose, multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) is extensively employed for MRD quantification, due to high sensitivity (down to 1:10 -3/ 10 -5 cells) and wide applicability (up to 90% of cases). The identification of 20 clustered residual leukemic cells seems sufficient for the recognition of MRD presence (lower limit of detection [LOD]), whereas a cluster of 50 events may be the minimum threshold for the quantification of a cell population (lower limit of quantitation [LOQ]), provided a sufficient denominator of relevant events (500'000-1'000'000) is acquired. Methods: Using a MFC assay, we assessed the predictive power of a threshold calculated applying the criteria of LOD and LOQ on 261 intensively treated AML patients enrolled in the GIMEMA AML1310 prospective trial.According to the protocol design, patients with a bone marrow residual leukemic cells count (RLCc) equal or above 0.035% of the total no. of mononuclear (MNC) cells qualified as MRD pos, , whileusing LOD and LOQ, we selected the following categories of patients: 1) LOD neg if RLCc was below LOD (20x100/total no. of events); 2) LOD pos -LOQ neg if RLCc was between LOD and LOQ; and 3) LOQ pos if RLCc was above LOQ (50x100/total no. of events). Results: The ELN target of 500'000 events was reached in 182/261 (69.6%) patients. Overall, using the predefined AML1310 protocol MRD threshold, 154 (59%) and 107 (41%) were MRD neg and MRD pos , respectively, whereas 74 (28.4%), 43 (16.5%) and 144 (54.4%) patients were classified as LOD neg , LOD pos -LOQ neg and LOQ pos , respectively. Two-year overall survival (OS) was 75.4% vs. 79.8% vs. 66.4% for LOD neg , LOD pos -LOQ neg and LOD pos , respectively (p=0.1197), and 74.5% vs. 66.4% according to AML1310 protocol 0.035% threshold for MRD neg and MRD pos patients, respectively (p=0.3521). Due to superimposable outcome, LOD-LOQ neg and LOD pos -LOQ neg categories were combined. Accordingly, LOD neg /LOD pos -LOQ neg and LOQ pos groups clearly differed in terms of OS (77% vs. 66.4%, p=0.0437) [FIGURE 1A] . Such a figure was challenged in multivariate analysis (p=0.048, HR 0.628, 95% CI 0.396-0.997) that confirmed the independent role of LOD-LOQ approach in influencing OS. To enhance the predictivity of LOD-LOQ estimate, we then focused on samples acquisition of which passed the 500'000 events, according to ELN guidelines. Among 182/261 (69.7%) cases with > 500'000 MNC events as denominator, LOD neg /LOD pos -LOQ neg and LOQ pos subgroups were clearly distinct in terms of OS (2-years OS of 83.5% vs. 69.4%, p=0.009). [FIGURE 1B] Similarly, also when selecting those patients (158/261 [60.5%]) whose acquisition passed 500'000 CD45+ events, LOD neg /LOD pos -LOQ neg and LOQ pos showed a different behavior with 2-years OS of 86.7% vs. 69.0%, respectively (p=0.004). [ FIGURE 1C] Finally, when considering the interaction of the 3 LOD-LOQ categories with possible post-remissional strategies, LOD neg /LOD pos -LOQ neg patients submitted to autologous stem cell transplant showed the best 2-years OS (88.9%) as compared to all the other categories (allogeneic stem cells transplant and no graft-based treatments) (p=0.026). Summary/Conclusion: In conclusion, the use of LOD-LOQ method results in a more sensitive detection of MRD that, in turn, translates in a more accurate recognition of patients with different prognosis. Actually, such an approach allowed to dissect even further the category of patients called MRD neg according to the AML1310 protocol definition, since MRD neg subjects who belonged to a \"true negative\" LOD-LOQ sub-group [LOD neg /LOD pos -LOQ neg ] had a better outcome than the other MRD neg ones. This MRD approach could serve as a useful tool to personalize post-remission strategy in intensively treated AML patients, through selection of high-quality remission patients who may benefit from less intensive post-consolidation therapies.
