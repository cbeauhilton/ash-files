    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2295 Background: While interaction between Factor V Leiden and other VTE risk exposures compound VTE risk, whether other gene-environment interactions are associated with VTE is largely unknown. Objective: To test novel gene-environment interactions for an association with VTE. Methods: Genome-wide scan (Illumina 660Q [557,112 SNPs]) and candidate gene (12,551 SNPs in 764 genes within the anticoagulant, procoagulant, fibrinolytic and innate immunity pathways) genotypes from 1270 non-Hispanic adults of European ancestry with objectively-diagnosed VTE (cases; no cancer, venous catheter or antiphospholipid antibodies) and 1302 controls (frequency-matched on case age, gender, race, MI/stroke status) were merged and imputed to 2.5 million SNPs with MACH using HapMap Phase 2 (60 CEU). We tested pairwise interactions between these SNPS and each of 7 exposures (\u201cstress\u201d [defined as ever hospitalized, ever surgery, ever trauma, ever transfemoral procedure or ever leg paresis], ever surgery, ever neurosurgery, ever orthopedic surgery; and among women, ever pregnant, \u22653 pregnancies and ever oral contraceptives/hormone therapy), adjusted for age, gender, MI/stroke status and state of residence, using logistic regression. Results: The mean \u00b1 standard deviation case and control ages were 54.4 \u00b1 16.2 and 55.6 \u00b1 15.8 years, respectively and 51% were female. Among the 7 models, a significant interaction was found between stress and A2BP1 (rs735919, OR=0.2, p=2.8E-07), ever surgery and ABCG8 (rs6709904, OR=0.27, p=2.1E-07), orthopedic surgery and SLC24A3 (rs6081599, OR=0.53, p=2.8E-07), neurosurgery and TBC1D4 (rs17064485, OR=8.5, p=3.5E-07), every pregnant and MICALCL (rs11022321, OR=0.17, p=8.3E-07), >3 pregnancies and KLRB1 (rs2536929, OR=0.31, p=1.1E-07) and ever oral contraceptives/hormone therapy and LINGO2 (rs10969259, OR=2.02, p=4.9E-07). A2BP1 plays a role in RBC shape and size, ABCG8 is associated with severe hypercholesterolemia, SLC24A3 is important for intracellular calcium homeostasis, TBC1D4 participates in cell signaling in CD4+/CD45RO+ memory T-cells, MICALCL is an extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2-binding protein, KLRB1 regulates natural killer cell function, and LINGO2 encodes a leucine-rich repeat signaling protein. Our observed interaction of VTE risk factors with these genes to compound the risk of VTE requires replication in future studies. If confirmed, functional studies will be important to determine the roles of these gene products in the causal pathway to VTE. Conclusion: VTE risk factors and SNPs within several novel genes may interact to compound the risk of VTE. Disclosures: Heit: Daiichi Sankyo: Consultancy, Honoraria."
