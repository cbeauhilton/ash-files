    "abstract_text": "Cell lines from homozygous deletion recombinant negative manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2 \u2212/\u2212 ) mice have intrinsic ionizing radiation sensitivity that is reversed by expression of the transgene for human SOD2 ( Radiation Research  154 : 365 , 2000 ). This study tests whether redox status influences adipocyte differentiation potential of bone marrow stromal cells by comparing the differentiation potential of SOD2 \u2212/\u2212 and SOD2 +/+ bone marrow stromal cell lines. Cells were cultured in basal medium (Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium, 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin +/ \u2212 adipocytogenic supplements (10 \u03bcg/ml insulin, 1 \u03bcM dexamethasone, 100 mM indomethacin)). Adipocytogenesis was assessed by spectrophotometric content of oil red-O dye and by RT-PCR for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR\u03b3) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity or glutathione (GSH) levels were measured by a Glutathione Peroxidase, Cellular Assay Kit or Glutathione Assay Kit, respectively, by Calbiochem, Inc. SOD2 +/+ cells developed adipocytes only when treated with adipocytogenic supplements and expressed PPAR\u03b3 and LPL at day 5. SOD2 \u2212/\u2212 cells cultured in basal conditions demonstrated constitutive adipocytogenesis. The level of GPX activity in SOD2 \u2212/\u2212 cells (43.2 \u00b1 3.5 mU/ml) was 52.7% (p<0.001) of that in SOD2 +/+ cells (82.0 \u00b1 2.3). The level of GSH in SOD2 \u2212/\u2212 cells (173 \u00b1 2 \u03bcM) was 78.6% (p=0.0089) of that in SOD2 +/+ cells (220 \u00b1 4 \u03bcM). Three day treatment of SOD2 \u2212/\u2212 with 4 mM WR2721 resulted in 22% reduction in oil red-O content. In addition, in SOD2 \u2212/\u2212 cells cultured in adipocytogenic medium, 3-day treatment in 4 mM WR2721 resulted in 46% reduction in oil red-O content and undetectable expression of PPAR\u03b3 and LPL. In conclusion, WR2721 limits constitutive adipocytogenesis and inhibits induced adipocytogenesis in SOD2 \u2212/\u2212 cells. These data provide evidence for the involvement of the cellular redox pathway in adipocyte differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells."
