Method: In this study trypan blue dye exclusion assay, MTT assay, and soft agar colony formation assay were used to analysis growth inhibition of wogonoside the on AML (acute human promyelocytic) cell lines. Propidium iodide (PI)-staining and cell cycle-regulatory proteins detecting by western blots were applied to exam whether wogonoside could induce cell cycle arrest. Then a series of experiment were used to assess the ability of wogonoside to overcome the AML associated differentiation block, by using Giemsa staining, Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction assay, and cell-surface differentiation antigens expression analysis. Real time PCR, western blots, cycloheximide inhibition test and RNA interference, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation, immunofluorescent staining were used to investigate the underlying mechanism. In this point we mainly focus that wogonoside exerts antileukemic by modulating of PLSCR1 gene expression, as well as influence its subcellular localization to play a role in regulating gene transcription. Result: It was demonstrated that wogonoside have the capacity to decrease the growth of myeloid cell lines by induction of G0/1 phase cell cycle arrest and differentiation. This effect is mediated by the increasing in mRNA and up-regulating protein expression of phospholipids scramblase 1 (PLSCR1). Meanwhile wogonoside promoted PLSCR1 traffic into the nucleus, which let PLSCR1 to play a role in regulating cell cycle and differentiation-related genes transcription including p21, p27, c-myc and IP3R1. Conclusion: Wogonoside induced AML cell lines to undergo differentiation and G1 phase arrest by restricting phospholipid scramblase 1 gene expression and promoting its translocation into nuclear.
