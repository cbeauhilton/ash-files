    "abstract_text": "Background: There are limited treatment options for multiple myeloma (MM) patients who have a disease progression after CAR-T therapy. ATG-010 (selinexor) is a novel, oral selective inhibitor of nuclear export, inhibiting exportin 1. US FDA has approved selinexor plus low dose dexamethasone (Sd) to treat patients (pts) with penta-refractory MM. MARCH study, a single arm, Phase 2, registrational study evaluating Sd in Chinese RRMM pts, achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 29.3% (95% CI: 19.7, 40.4), rejecting the null hypothesis of the study. Given its unique and novel mechanism of action, Sd preserves anti-tumor activity regardless of specific prior therapies. In the MARCH study, encouraging activity was demonstrated in a small group of Chinese RRMM pts previously exposed to CAR-T therapy. Methods: The study enrolled 82 pts previously exposed and refractory to a proteasome inhibitor (PI), an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), and last line of therapy. Among them, 10 had received lymphodepleting conditioning followed by CAR-T cell therapy before study screening. ATG-010 (80mg) plus dexamethasone (20mg) was administered orally twice weekly. Response was assessed by an independent review committee. Results: Among 10 pts, 8 were male and 2 were female. Median age was 58.5 years. Median duration from MM initial diagnosis was 5.2 years. A total of 6 pts (60.0%) had high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, including 4 pts (40.0%) with del (17p). Three pts had baseline plasmacytoma. Five pts (50%) experienced very rapid disease progression as indicated by a median of 46.2% increase of tumor burden from screening to Cycle 1 Day 1. Patients were heavily pre-treated with a median of 9.5 prior regimens (range: 5-12), with 8 receiving more than 6 regimens. Four pts were exposed to daratumumab (triple-class exposure). ORR was 50% including 1 very good partial response and 4 partial responses. Disease control rate defined as SD and above was 70%. Median duration of response was 1.4 months (mo) (95% CI: 0.96, NE). Median progression free survival was 1.9 mo (95% CI: 0.93, 3.74). xx pts (xx%) pts died; median overall survival was not reached, and estimated 12-mo OS rate was 68.6%. Adverse events were consistent with those events previously reported with Sd regimen in RRMM patients. The most common grade\u22653 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) included anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and nausea. Most events were manageable with appropriate supportive care or dose modification. Four pts (40%) experienced TESAEs, including anemia, pneumonia, neutropenia, and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. There were no TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation or death. Conclusions: Sd was able to induce an encouraging response with a manageable safety profile for a group of Chinese RRMM patients desperately needing treatment after failing CAR-T therapy. With the small sample size, further investigation is warranted, including using ATG-010 in combination with other anti-MM therapies to potentially enhance and prolong therapeutic benefit.
