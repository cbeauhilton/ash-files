    "abstract_text": "A total of 46 patients (24 female, 22 male) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) received RIC allogeneic blood stem cell transplants from either fully HLA-compatible family donors (n=14) or unrelated HLA-compatible donors (n=32) between 3/1999 and 3/2007. The unselected consecutive single centre study patients (median age: 52 years, range: 22\u201364) were at high risk for treatment-related complications (older age, previous infectious complications, impaired organ function). 67% (n=31) of the cohort were not in first remisson but in an advanced status of AML. All patients received 30 mg\u00b7m \u22122 Fludarabine i.v. day \u221210 to \u22125, Busulfan 4mg\u00b7kg \u22121 orally day \u22125 to \u22124, and 10 mg\u00b7kg \u22121 i.v. Antithymocyteglobulin (ATG-Fresenius\u00ae) day \u22124 to \u22121 as RIC prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. A median of unselected 6.8 x 10 6 CD-34 positive stem cells (range: 1.9\u201314.3) were given. GvHD-prophylaxis consisted of Cyclosporin 3mg\u00b7kg \u22121 continuous infusion in case of 10/10 HLA compatibility donor situation (n=34), with the addition of mycophenolate mofetil 2gr. i.v. primarily starting from day +10 in one antigen mismatched HLA-unrelated donor situation (n=12). Nine patients (19.6%) died of therapy related mortality, due to GvHD (n=3), infections (n=4), or both (n=2). Relapses occurred in 18 patients (39%), in five patients even more than one year after transplantation. The median observation time of the study group was 19 months (range: 3\u2013101), the product-limit estimates (Kaplan-Meier) of overall survival (OS) at 36 months were 0.48 (\u00b10.08), of event-free survival (EFS) 0.44 (\u00b10.08), respectively.

RIC with Fludarabine/Busulfan/ATG prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation results in a consistently sustained long-term outcome for this otherwise adverse patient subgroup, favouring family-matched donor selection.",
