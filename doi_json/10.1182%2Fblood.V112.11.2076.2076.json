    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: CLL is a disorder with a wide variation in outcome. Patients with adverse cellular features are often refractory to treatment and have a short overall survival. Individuals with CLL-type MBL are unlikely to require treatment and in most cases will eventually die of an unrelated cause. Many factors that predict a poor outcome have been identified, including stage, IGHV mutation status, ZAP-70 expression, and deletions of chromosomes 17p (TP53) and/or 11q23 (ATM). Deletions and mutations in TP53 are generally not presenting features and appear to require clonal evolution. One hypothesis is that the degree of intraclonal variation in genes targeted by the somatic hypermutation machinery, e.g. IGHV and BCL6, may predict the potential for clonal evolution. We have previously tested 66 antigens for their capacity to differentiate proliferating CLL cells, resting CLL cells and normal B-cells and identified 30 potentially relevant markers, including common markers such as CD38 and less frequently used markers such as the Leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LAIR1). AIM: To compare the expression of relevant cell surface markers with the degree of intraclonal variation in the IGHV and BCL6 genes and to determine if these markers can be used to differentiate CLL-type MBL and CLL with or without adverse biological features. METHODS: The cell surface phenotype was assessed by 6-colour cytometry in 133 patients: 22 CLL with deletion 17p or 11q23, 69 CLL with no adverse prognostic chromosomal abnormalities, and 42 MBL. Surface phenotype was also compared with IGHV mutation status in a cohort of 29 CLL patients (16 \u22642% IGHV mutation, 13 >2% IGHV mutation). These antigens were also assessed using 4-colour flow cytometry in 20 cases (4 MBL, 16 CLL) and compared with IGHV & BCL6 mutation status and degree of intraclonal variation (defined as the proportion of mutations that were detected in a single clone only), and with ZAP-70 (AF488-1E7.2) expression. RESULTS: CLL cases with \u22642% IGHV mutation showed increased expression of CD38 (6.8 fold, p 0.02), CD49d (4.9-fold, P = 0.04), IgD (2.0-fold, P = 0.05), ZAP-70 (1.5-fold, P=0.04) and decreased expression of LAIR-1 (6.2-fold, P = 0.003) in comparison to CLL cases with >2% IGHV mutation. CLL cases with deletions of 17p and 11q23 showed decreased expression of CCR6 (1.7-fold, P = 0.0001), IgD (1.3-fold, P = 0.03) and LAIR-1 (7.1-fold, P2% overall IGHV mutation in both IGHV (median 0.075% vs. 0.049% unique mutations, P>0.05) and BCL6 (median 0.10% vs. 0.095% unique mutations, P>0.05). However, there was an inverse relationship between BCL6 and IGHV intraclonal variation and cases with the highest levels of BCL6 intraclonal variation showed significantly decreased expression of CD39 (1.9-fold, P = 0.04) and LAIR1 (4.7-fold, P = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: There were no markers or marker combinations that could discriminate MBL from CLL. The key differences were decreased expression of markers that are expressed during cell cycle, i.e. CD23, and adhesion markers such as CD62L and CD49d. These markers show sequential changes with disease stage, supporting the hypothesis that cellular interactions are central to the accumulation and expansion of CLL cells. However, the marker most consistently associated with adverse biological features is LAIR1, which is weak or negative in CLL with \u22642% IGHV mutation, high levels of intraclonal variation and TP53 or ATM deletions. LAIR-1 is an inhibitory receptor involved in regulating classs-witching. LAIR1 is strongly expressed in normal circulating peripheral B-cells. As with other prognostic markers, expression is a continuous variable and therefore a suitable cutoff will need to be identified. However, fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies are readily available and expression on CLL cells is stable for several days in EDTA samples which should minimise inter-laboratory analytical variation. LAIR1 expression in CLL is more closely associated with IGHV mutation status than CD38 or ZAP-70 expression. LAIR1 is a promising prognostic marker that appears to be central to the development of aggressive CLL as there is a strong association between downregulation of LAIR1, intraclonal heterogeneity in BCL6 and development of TP53 and ATM deletions."
