    "abstract_text": "Mature microRNA (miRNA) originated from primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) is a new group of potential regulator for cell differentiation, apoptosis, proliferation and oncogenesis. Some miRNAs were recently identified in hematopoietic cells, while the roles of miRNAs in erythrocytic and megakaryocytic cells had not been well examined. As a first step to explore for miRNAs specific for hematopoietic lineage, the expressions of several known primary microRNAs in erythrocytic and megakaryocytic cell lines, such as TF-1, HL-60, HEK293 and UT-7 leukemia cells, were examined by RT-PCR. We consequently focused on the pri-miR-10a, a primary transcript of miR-10a located within Hox gene clusters, and found the significant expression in TF-1 cells and UT-7/EPO cells. The UT-7/EPO cells were a subline established from the original UT-7 cells, as well as UT-7/GM and UT-7/TPO cells; therefore it was suitable for the further comparative analysis. Interestingly, in UT-7/EPO cells, the expression of pri-miR-10a increased under stimulation of erythropoietin (EPO; 1U/mL and 10U/mL). Based on these observations, it was postulated that pri-miR-10a might involve in modulating erythrocyte differentiation or proliferation. To clarify the role of pri-miR-10a in UT-7/EPO, we have established clonal cell lines by transfecting UT-7/EPO cells with either the control vector or the pri-miR-10a expression vector pCMV-pri-miR10a. Overexpression of pri-miR-10a in the UT-7/EPO cell line (miR10a-UT-7/EPO) was confirmed by RT-PCR. MiR10a-UT-7/EPO showed higher proliferation rate even at low concentration of EPO (0.1 mU/mL). Overexpression of pri-miR-10a did not appear to affect HOXB4 and HOXA1 expression, as similar mRNA levels were seen in both cell lines. It was notable that the cellular size of miR10a-UT-7/EPO became larger than its parental cells. Morphological studies of miR10a-UT-7/EPO were performed in detail. It is possible that miR-10a was capable to modulate morphological features particularly in cellular size relating to cell cycle regulation. For instance, loss of the E2F family members result in marked macrocytic anemia with megaloblastic features in adult mice (Mol Cell. 2000 Aug;6(2):281\u201391., Mol Cell Biol. 2003 May;23(10):3607\u201322., Blood. 2006 Aug 1;108(3):886\u201395.). Data presented here hypothesized that the roles of miR-10a in erythroid cells are tightly associated with cell cycle."
