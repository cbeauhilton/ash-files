    "abstract_text": "Retroviral transfer of T cell receptors (TCRs) to peripheral blood derived T cells generates large numbers of T cells with the same antigen specificity, which can potentially be used for adoptive immunotherapy. One drawback of this procedure is the formation of mixed \u03b1 \u03b2 TCR dimers with unknown specificities due to pairing of endogenous and introduced TCR chains. To completely prevent the formation of mixed TCR dimers by TCR gene transfer to \u03b1 \u03b2 T cells we investigated whether \u03b3 \u03b4 T cells can serve as alternative host T cells for \u03b1 \u03b2 TCR transfer, since the \u03b3 \u03b4 TCR is not capable of forming dimers with the \u03b1 \u03b2 TCR. Peripheral blood derived \u03b3 \u03b4T cells were isolated by immunomagnetic bead isolation and subsequent FACS sorting, resulting in >99% pure populations of \u03b3 \u03b4T cells. The isolated \u03b3 \u03b4T cells were retrovirally transduced with three different TCRs specific for the hematopoietic minor histocompatibility antigen (mHag) HA-2 in the context of HLA-A2, for CMV-pp65 in the context of HLA-B7, or for the HLA class II restricted mHag DBY. The TCR-transduced \u03b3 \u03b4T cells expressed both the introduced TCRs and the endogenous \u03b3 \u03b4TCR at their cell surface as determined by FACS analysis. When \u03b3 \u03b4T cells transduced with the HLA class I restricted HA-2-TCR or CMV-TCR were stained with tetramers, only the CMV-TCR expressing \u03b3 \u03b4T cells but not the HA-2-TCR expressing \u03b3 \u03b4T cells were capable of strong antigen specific tetramer binding. In contrast, functional analysis indicated that all TCR-transduced \u03b3 \u03b4T cells specifically recognized peptide pulsed target cells leading to target cell lysis and IFN\u03b3 and IL-4 production, indicating that while the avidity of the HA-2-TCR engineered \u03b3 \u03b4T cells was insufficient for strong antigen specific tetramer binding, the avidity was high enough for the specific recognition of peptide pulsed target cells. However, the functional reactivity of the TCR-transduced \u03b3 \u03b4T cells against target cells presenting endogenously processed antigens was low. FACS analysis indicated that most \u03b3 \u03b4T cells lacked the expression of the coreceptors CD4 and CD8. Therefore, we investigated whether introduction of the relevant coreceptor could enhance the functionality of the redirected \u03b3 \u03b4T cells. Co-transfer of the CD8\u03b1 \u03b2 coreceptor to the HA-2-TCR and CMV-TCR transferred \u03b3 \u03b4T cells turned them into effective, antigen specific tetramer binders. Furthermore, expression of CD8\u03b1 \u03b2 by the HA-2-TCR and CMV-TCR transduced \u03b3 \u03b4T cells and CD4 by the DBY-TCR transduced \u03b3 \u03b4T cells generated powerful effector cells exerting high levels of antigen specific lysis of both peptide pulsed target cells and target cells presenting endogenously processed antigen. In addition, coreceptor expressing TCR-engineered \u03b3 \u03b4T cells produced high amounts of IFN\u03b3 and IL-4 when stimulated with peptide pulsed target cells or endogenously processed antigen. To investigate the anti-leukemic reactivity of TCR-transferred \u03b3 \u03b4T cells, we determined the antigen specific cytotoxicity and cytokine production against primary CML and AML cells by \u03b3 \u03b4T cells equipped with the HA-2-TCR and CD8\u03b1 \u03b2 . We observed both antigen specific cytolytic activity and cytokine production against both CML and AML cells expressing the hematopoiesis specific mHag HA-2, while HLA-A2 + leukemic cells lacking expression of the HA-2 mHag were not recognized. These data demonstrate that transfer of \u03b1 \u03b2 TCRs to \u03b3 \u03b4T cells generated potent effector cells for immunotherapy of leukemia, without the expression of potentially hazardous mixed TCR dimers.",
