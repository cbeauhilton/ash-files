    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4770 Introduction: The care of patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is frequently complicated by difficult venous access complicating blood sampling for laboratory investigations including hemoglobin (Hb) measurement. Non-invasive hemoglobin concentration monitoring is a potential solution, albeit not validated yet in patients with SCD. The primary objective of this study was to validate non-invasive pulse CO-oximetry based hemoglobin estimation in this patient population. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study on patients with SCD admitted to the inpatient wards over 4 weeks in a tertiary care hospital. We estimated a spot Hemoglobin (Sp Hb) measurement using Masimo Pronto-7 Pulse CO-oximetry device (two measurements per patient) and compared it to a venous sample Hb (Reference Hemoglobin; Ref Hb) measured using Abbott CELL-DYN Sapphire hematology analyzer. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination (R 2 ). The multivariable linear regression model of predicting the estimation differences included age, gender, weight, height, blood pressure and reference hemoglobin. Results: We enrolled 98 patients (45 males, 53 females) with a mean age of 26 years (SD 8.8; 14\u201375) and a mean Ref Hb of 9.2 g/dL (SD 1.5; 5.3\u201313). The mean Sp Hb was 10.1 g/dL (SD 2.0; 5.3\u201314.5). The correlation coefficient between the Sp Hb and Ref Hb was 0.54 (R 2 = 29%) with a mean difference of 0.9 g/dL (SD 1.7; \u22124.8 to 4.5). In the multivariable model, gender (p =0.042) and Ref Hb level (p=0.001) were statistically significant predictors for the difference in measurement. A strong correlation between the two CO-oximetry Hb measurements was obtained (correlation coefficient = 0.81, R 2 = 65%). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated the validity of the CO-oximetry Hb measurement in adult patients with SCD. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm our results.
