Recent studies has shown that the Hox proteins are important in the control of differentiation and proliferation in hematopoietic cells. We found that the Abl kinase inhibitors increased the expression of HoxA10 gene in CML cells. In this study, we analyzed the role of HoxA10 in CML cell lines and the hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from CML patients by inhibiting the expression of HoxA10. Moreover, we investigated whether the regulation of HoxA10 eradicate Ph + hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, which are the targets for leukemic transformation in CML. [Methods] We used AMN107 and BMS354825 for the Abl kinase inhibitors, LY294002 for a PI3K inhibitor, PP2 for a Src kinase inhibitor, and SB203580 for a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor. For analysis of HoxA10 mRNA and protein, RT-PCR and western blot were performed in K562, Meg-01 and U937 cells, which untreated or treated with AMN107, BMS354825, LY294002, PP2, or SB203580 respectively. We then attempted to localize the intracellular locations of HoxA10 in K562 and Meg01, which untreated or treated with AMN107, BMS354825, or LY294002 by using conforcal fluorescence microscopy. For analysis of proliferation in K562, Meg-01 and U937 transfected with siRNA HoxA10, MTT assays were performed in untransfected or transfected K562, Meg-01 and U937 treated with or without AMN107, BMS354825, or LY294002. Finally, we counted the colony numbers of CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM, and BFU-E in K562 and Meg-01 treated with the Abl kinase inhibitors or LY294002. Results Both K562 and Meg01 cells expressed HoxA10 mRNA and protein at lower level compared to U937 cells. Interestingly, treatment with AMN107, BMS354825, or LY294002 increased the expression of HoxA10 mRNA and protein in both K562 and Meg01 cells. The fluorescence of HoxA10 was more strongly observed in the area corresponding to the cell\u2019s cytoplasm than nucleus, and the treatment with AMN107, BMS354825, or LY294002 increased the fluorescence in nucleus of K562 and Meg01 cells in a time-dependent manner. In K562 and Meg01 cells transfected with the siRNA HoxA10, treatment with AMN107 or BMS354825 slightly inhibited the proliferation compared to K562 and Meg01 transfected with control siRNA. Finally, we showed that the inhibition of HoxA10 expression by siRNA increased the numbers of CFU-GEMM, BFU-E, and CFU-GM when the cells were treated with the combination of BMS354825 and LY294002 compared to control cells. [Conclusions] In this study, we showed that the Abl kinase inhibitors induced the expression of HoxA10, and HoxA10 was regulated by PI3K pathway in CML cells. This finding indicates a new insight in the regulation of cell proliferation via the PI3K signal pathway in CML cells. Moreover, we found the role of HoxA10 in CML cell lines and the hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from CML patients by inhibiting the expression of HoxA10. We showed that the regulation of HoxA10 eradicated Bcr-Abl + hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, which are the targets for leukemic transformation in CML.",
