Determining correlates of PB pre-apheresis CD34+ counts would facilitate identifying patients that may be at high risk of mobilization failure. Methods. A total of 851 consecutive autologous apheresis procedures were performed at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between January 2005 and December 2009. We randomly selected half (N=413) of this study population to serve as a study sample (described in table ), and preserved the remaining for validation studies. In this study population, we observed that 96% of patients with PB pre-apheresis CD34+ counts of >40/\u03bcL collected >2\u00d710 6 CD34+cells/Kg on the first day of apheresis. We sought to determine patient and disease characteristics that are associated with higher PB pre-apheresis CD34+ counts (>40/\u03bcL). These factors included patient age (quartiles), gender, weight (quartiles), diagnosis (Multiple Myeloma vs. Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma), disease status at transplant (remission vs. active disease), number of prior chemotherapy regimens (< 2 vs. \u22652), blood count on day of collection: hemoglobin level (\u226410 vs. >10 g/dL), WBC (<4 vs. \u2265 4 \u00d710 9 /L), absolute neutrophil count [ANC] (< vs.\u2265 median), and platelet count (\u2264150 vs. <150 \u00d710 9 /L); and number days (\u2264 vs. > median) from the beginning of mobilization to the first apheresis procedure. Results. On univariate analysis, shorter duration from beginning of mobilization therapy to first day of apheresis (odds ratio [OR] =4.7, p 95 Kg (OR=1.8, p=0.01), were significantly associated with a PB CD34+count >40/\u03bcL; whereas a diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma (OR=0.5, p=0.002), age >60 years (OR=0.6, p=0.009), pre-apheresis WBC <4 \u00d7 10 9 /L (OR=0.5, p=0.004) and ANC (< median p=0.003) were significantly associated with PB CD34+ counts of \u2264 40/\u03bcL. These factors, with the exception of age, remained significant on multivariate analysis. Shorter duration of mobilization (OR=8.1, p40/\u03bcL. A diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma was associated with lower PB CD34+ count in patients who had a shorter mobilization course (OR=0.3, p95 Kg was still associated with higher PB CD34+ count, (OR=1.9, p 0.01). There was no association between PB CD34+ count and any of the remaining factors evaluated. Conclusion: Our data suggest that patients who take longer to mobilize, have low WBC and [ANC] pre-apheresis might benefit from early intervention with novel mobilization strategies. Table  . N=413 .
