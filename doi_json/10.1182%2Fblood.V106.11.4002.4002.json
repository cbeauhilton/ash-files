    "abstract_text": "Background: Helicobacter pylori ( H pylori ) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of some autoimmune diseases including idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Several studies recently showed a high prevalence of H pylori infection in patients with ITP and reported a platelet recovery after bacterial eradication therapy. The prevalence of H pylori infection and effect of its eradication in Korea patients with chronic ITP were investigated. Methods: The study included among 35 patients with chronic ITP from eight hospitals. H pylori infection was assessed by urea breath test, rapid urease test or microbial culture. H pylori eradication was performed with amoxicillin, clarithromycin and omeprazol regimen for 7 days or bismuth, metronidazol and tetracycline regimen for 10 days. Eradication was assessed by urea breath test 4 weeks after treatment. Platelet counts were monitored serially after the end of treatment. Results: Thirty five patients with chronic ITP were evaluated, including 12 males and 23 females. Median age was 57 years (range 30\u201379). The median platelet count before eradication was 23,000/uL (range 4,000\u201366,000/uL). Sixteen patients were performed the splenectomy previously. H pylori infection was found in 23 (65%) of 35 patients. In 21 patients performed the eradication, 6 patients (28.5%) had a significant increase in platelet count after 2 weeks and 2 months. The response duration was 1\u201327 (median 7.6) months. Conclusions: This study confirmed the efficacy of H pylori eradication in increasing platelet in adult chronic ITP patients. We must consider the investigation and eradication of H pylori infection in ITP patients as a simple, inexpensive tool in management of the chronic disease.",
