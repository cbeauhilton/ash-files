    "abstract_text": "The 2008 Guidelines for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia require a B-cell count \u22655.0\u00d710 9 /L ( Hallek et al, Blood , 111 , 5446 , 2008 ). Clonal B-cell populations below <5.0\u00d710 9 /L, and in the absence of adenopathy, organomegaly or cytopenia, are defined as Monoclonal B-Lymphocytosis (MBL) (Marti et al., Br. J. Haematol., 2005). We analysed the frequency and nature of small B-cell clonal populations identified in a large, non-hospital based pathology laboratory servicing both metropolitan and regional areas of New South Wales, Australia. There were 414 patients identified from 2000 to 2005 with an incidental finding of a B-cell clone with total B-lymphocytes (defined as CD19+ cells) <5.0\u00d710 9 /L fulfilling the criteria for MBL. There were 212 males (51%) and 202 females (49%) with a mean age of 69.7 years (range 14\u201397 years). Patients could be clearly divided into two major groups: 322 (77.7%) with a typical chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) phenotype (MBL[cll]) and 92 (22.3%) with a \u2018non-CLL\u2019 phenotype (MBL[nhl]). Analysis of MBL[cll] showed a near equal gender distribution of 168 (52.2%) males and 154 (47.8%) females with a mean age of 70.6 years (range 41\u201394 years). No patient had a CLL clone aged younger than 40 years, and for each subsequent age decade there were 4% (40\u201349 yrs), 13% (50\u201359yrs), 23% (60\u201369yrs), 40% (70\u201379yrs), 18% (80\u201389yrs) and 2% (>90yrs) of the patients with a CLL clone, mirroring the age distribution of CLL. The mean clonal level (CD19/CD5+) was 2.36\u00d710 9 /L (range 0.01\u20135.21\u00d710 9 /L), the mean B-cell count (CD19+) 2.50\u00d710 9 /L (range 0.02\u20134.97 \u00d710 9 /L) and the mean absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was 4.71 \u00d710 9 /L (range 0.4\u201310.5\u00d710 9 /L. Over half (52%) of these patients fulfilled NCI-1988/1996 criteria for the diagnosis of CLL (with ALC \u22655.0\u00d710 9 /L). The ALC was within the laboratory reference range (1.0\u20134.0 \u00d710 9 /L) in only 22% of patients. Follow-up analysis on a representative cohort of 146 patients showed progression to a lymphocyte count >30\u00d710 9 /L in 15 patients over a mean of 4.03 (range 1\u20138) years, and including 3 patients with clonal populations originally measuring <1.5\u00d710 9 /L. Analysis of the 92 patients with a \u2018non-CLL\u2019 phenotype (MBL[nhl]) showed 44 (47.8%) males and 48 (52.2%) females, with a mean age of 66.7 years (range 14\u201397 years). The mean clonal level in this group was 1.27\u00d710 9 /L. The level of the clonal population with MBL[nhl] was <2.0\u00d710 9 /L in 77% and <3.0\u00d710 9 /L in 92% of patients. There were 66 patients (71.7%) with MBL[nhl] with a phenotype of \u201clymphoma not otherwise unspecified\u201d (i.e. pan-B cell+, monoclonal surface immunoglobulin++, CD5\u2212, CD10\u2212, CD103\u2212) and the remainder had \u2018specific\u2019 diagnosis possible on review of the peripheral blood morphology and phenotype as follows: \u2018Mantle Cell Lymphoma\u2019-like (CD5+, CD23+) - 10 (10.9%), Splenic Lymphoma with Villous Lymphocytes - 7 (7.6%), \u2018Follicular Lymphoma\u2019 (CD10+) - 4 (4.3%), Hairy Cell Leukaemia (CD103+) - 4 (4.3%), Hairy Cell Leukemia Variant - 1 (1%). MBL is not uncommon in the immunophenotyping laboratory and can be conveniently divided into two dominant groups, the majority with a phenotype typical of CLL (MBL[cll]), while there are a range of non-CLL phenotype identified (MBL[nhl]), some with a \u2018specific\u2019 diagnosis. In 322 patients with an MBL[cll] clone below the defined cut-off point for CLL of B-cells <5.0\u00d710 9 /L, the absolute B-cell count is a linear continuous variable. This data suggests that MBL[cll] is not a precursor state or predisposition but rather the same biological process as early CLL (separated by an arbitrary definitional cut-off) from which some will progress but many will remain stable.",
