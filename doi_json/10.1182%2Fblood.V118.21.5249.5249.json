    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5249 TAFI (thrombin-activated fibrinolysis inhibitor) and PAI-1 play important roles in fibrinolysis, as they both reduce plasmin generation; PAI-1 a 50 KDa glycoprotein is a serine-proteinase inhibitor; TAFI is a 55 KDa plasma zymogen that is activated by either plasmin/thrombin or thrombin/thrombomodulin complex into an active carboxypeptidase, in particular, it is a basic zinc dependent metallo-carboxipeptidase specific for C-terminal lysine and arginine residue inhibiting degradation of the fibrin clot. We investigated the influence of PAI-1 and TAFI levels on stroke by determining their plasmatic antigen concentration by an electro-immunoassay. We found that PAI-1 levels are increased during the early stage of stroke and that it may also predict clot lysis resistance in patients treated with trombolysis (38.8 ng/ml +/\u2212 14.6, p 180 nmol/l (OR.12.9 CI 1.42 to 116.6), had a sensibility of 92.2%, and a specificity of 98.4% in predicting stroke. The analysis of these results showed that TAFI antigen levels higher than 180nmo/L combined with PAI-1 levels higher than 24 mg/ml are a strong risk factor for clot lysis, stroke (for the evolution, severity, and outcome) and showed a potentially attractive target for fibrinolytic therapies.
