    "abstract_text": "Background: During the past decade, prognostic tools and outcomes of patients with newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) markedly improved. Data from clinical trials evaluating early morbidity and mortality including patients with transplant-eligible NDMM treated with novel agents are scarce. Thus, we aimed to analyze early morbidity and mortality in this patient cohort, devise and validate a predictive score to identify patients at risk. Patients and methods: Between July 2005 and January 2018, 1333 patients with transplant-eligible NDMM from three subsequent phase III trials, HD4, MM5 and HD6 from the German-speaking Myeloma Multicenter Group (GMMG), received a novel agent-based induction therapy with either bortezomib (BTZ) / doxorubicine / dexamethasone (DEX; PAD: n=192, HD4; PAd: n=296, MM5), BTZ / cyclophosphamide / DEX (VCD: n=300, MM5), BTZ / lenalidomide / DEX (VRD: n=272, HD6) or elotuzumab / VRD (ELO-VRD: n=273, HD6). Severe infections (SI) were defined as any infection grade \u2265 3 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). SI and early deaths were counted on and up to 30 days post induction therapy. Uni-/multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess predictive factors for SI and early death and to account for trial effects. Data from the European Myeloma Network (EMN) 02 / Dutch-Belgian Cooperative Trial Group for Hematology Oncology Foundation (HOVON) 95 phase III trial including 1497 patients with transplant-eligible NDMM receiving induction therapy with VCD were used to validate a predictive score for SI and early mortality. Results: Overall, early mortality during induction therapy was low (n=24, 1.8%) in the GMMG cohort. SI were the most common cause for early deaths (n=15, 62.5%) as compared to MM progression-related death (n=5, 20.8%) and other causes (n=4, 16.7%). Rates of SI during induction therapy were 11.9% (n=159) and decreased in subsequent trial generations: HD4-PAD: 27.1%, MM5-PAd: 10.8%, MM5-VCD: 9.3%, HD6-VRD: 7.3% and HD6-ELO-VRD: 9.9% of patients. In the EMN02/HO95 trial, early mortality was 1.7% (n=25) and rates of SI were 6.8% (n=101). A multivariate model including patient and disease baseline characteristics identified four major risk factors for SI and/or early death on induction therapy in the GMMG cohort: age (>60 years; odds ratio [OR]=1.70, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.21-2.40, p=0.002), International Staging System (stage III; OR=1.92, 95% CI: 1.22-2.94, p=0.005), platelet count (1; OR=1.82, 95% CI: 1.10-3.06, p=0.022). A sum score based on these four risk factors (one risk factor = one point) was built and included 519 (39.5%), 550 (41.9%) and 245 (18.6%) patients with a score of 0, 1 and \u22652 points. A higher score gradually predicted an increasing risk for SI and/or death during induction therapy: 0 points=7.9%, 1 point=11.5% and \u22652 points=23.2% (p<0.001, Figure 1A); SI only: 0 points=7.7%, 1 point=10.9% and \u22652 points=21.6% (p<0.001, Figure 1B) and early death only: 0 points=0.4%, 1 point=1.3% and \u22652 points=5.7% (p<0.001, Figure 1C). In the EMN02/HO95 cohort, 673 (45.6%), 587 (39.7%) and 217 (14.7%) patients had a score of 0, 1 and \u22652 points. The score was successfully validated in the EMN02/HO95 cohort: SI and/or death during induction therapy: 0 points=5.0%, 1 point=8.3% and \u22652 points=11.9% (p<0.001); SI only: 0 points=4.5%, 1 point=7.0% and \u22652 points=10.0% (p=0.006) and early death only: 0 points=0.5%, 1 point=2.2% and \u22652 points=2.5% (p=0.01). Conclusions: To date, this is the largest pooled analysis of individual patient data on early morbidity and mortality in patients with transplant-eligible NDMM treated with novel agent-based induction therapy. Our analysis highlights a decreasing incidence of SI and early mortality and proposes a validated, easy-to-use score to identify patients at excessive risk for SI and/or early death during induction therapy. This allows the implementation of intensive monitoring, preventive and supportive strategies for this subgroup of patients in further clinical trials and also routine care.
