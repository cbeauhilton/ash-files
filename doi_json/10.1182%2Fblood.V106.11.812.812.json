    "abstract_text": "Background: In our study for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in 1980\u2019s (JCOG8701), human T-lymphotropic virus type-1- associated ATLL was the poorest prognostic subtype in NHL. The complete response (CR) rate was 42%, the median survival time (MST) was 8 months, and the 4-yr overall survival (OS) was 12% ( Proc ASCO  13 : 378 , 1994 ). Our previous phase II study (JCOG9303) of G-CSF-supported, dose-intensified multi-agent chemotherapy with VCAP (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisolone), AMP (doxorubicin, ranimustine, prednisolone) and VECP (vindesine, etoposide, carboplatin, prednisolone) with intrathecal prophylaxis for aggressive ATLL, showed promising results with response rate (RR) of 81% and MST of 13 months ( Br J Haematol  113 : 375 , 2001 ). To test the superiority of this VCAP-AMP-VECP regimen over biweekly-CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone), we conducted a phase III trial. Methods: Previously untreated patients (pts) with aggressive ATLL, acute-, lymphoma- or unfavorable chronic-type, were randomized either to receive 6 courses of VCAP-AMP-VECP every 4 weeks (arm A) or 8 courses of biweekly-CHOP (arm B) with minimization method balancing performance status and institution. Both regimens were supported with G-CSF and intrathecal prophylaxis using cytarabine, methotrexate and prednisolone. Eligibility included preserved organ functions and aged 15\u201369 years. Primary endpoint was OS to be compared by log-rank test. Assuming 60 eligible pts in each arm, the study had 0.8 power to detect a 15% difference in 3-year OS at 0.05 one-sided alpha. Results: 118 pts (57 in arm A, 61 in arm B) were randomized between 07/98 and 10/03. Median follow-up time in all randomized pts was 11.0 months at 12/04. 72 % of the pts responded, with 23 pts achieving CR (40%) and 18 achieving partial response (PR; 32%) in arm A. The RR was 66%, with 15 pts achieving CR (25%) and 25 achieving PR (41%) in arm B. The median progression-free survival (PFS) time and PFS at one-year in arm A were 7.0 months and 28.1%, respectively, whereas 5.4 months and 16.2% in arm B. The MST and OS at 3 years in arm A were 12.7 months and 23.6%, respectively, whereas 10.9 months and 12.7% in arm B. Log-rank p-value for primary end point, OS, was 0.085. After adjustment of patients\u2019 characteristics at registration by Cox regression, the p value became 0.029 because of unbalanced prognostic factors such as bulky lesion. In arm A vs. arm B, %G4 neutropenia, %G4 thrombocytopenia and %G4 infection were 98% vs. 83%, 74% vs. 17% and 7% vs. 3%, respectively. Three toxic deaths were reported in arm A. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that VCAP-AMP-VECP yields longer OS time than biweekly-CHOP but with higher toxicity profiles that are acceptable, and suggest that the former regimen should be the standard therapy for aggressive ATLL.",
