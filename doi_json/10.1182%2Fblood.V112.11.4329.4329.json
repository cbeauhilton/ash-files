    "abstract_text": "Models using acute GVHD (aGVHD) to predict post allo-HCT survival rely on criteria with considerable inter-observer subjectivity. We study the impact of clinical, laboratory and pharmacologic parameters, during the immediate post-transplant phase [from hematologic engraftment till day 90 (\u00b17)] on NRS and OS. In this analysis, 326 consecutive pts underwent allo-HCT between 09/2000 until 03/2007; 26 pts who died within 90 days from stem cell infusion and 3 recipients of syngeneic allo-HCT were excluded. A total of 297 (M/F=170/127) pts, median age 46 (range: 17\u201369) yrs received an allo-HCT [MRD=154 (52%), MUD=109 (37%), MMRD=3 (1%), MMUD=31 (10%)] using PBSC=261 (88%) or BM=36 (12%) following myeloablative=99 (33%), RIC=174 (59%), or NMT=24 (8%) for various hematologic malignancies stratified by CIBMTR risk [low=87 (30%); int=85 (29%); high=125 (42%)] using various GVHD prophylaxis regimens [MTX-based=244(82%); MMF-based=53 (18%)]. Pre-transplant variables [significant (p80) [OS: NS; NRS: NS], CIBMTR risk (low vs. int. vs. high) [OS: NS; NRS: NS], regimen (myeloablative vs. RIC/NMT) [OS: NS; NRS: NS], donor/recipient matching-status (MRD, MUD, mismatched (ref)) [OS: p=0.03, MRD vs. ref: HR=2.7 (95% CI: 1.2\u20136.1), MUD vs. ref: HR=2.7 (95% CI: 1.2\u20136.1); NRS: NS], CD34+ dose (< 3\u00d710 6 /kg, 3\u20137.9 \u00d710 6 /kg, \u22658\u00d710 6 /kg) [OS: NS; NRS: NS], GVHD prophylaxis (MTX-based vs. MMF-based) [OS: NS; NRS: NS], recipient/donor CMV status [OS: NS; NRS: NS]. Multivariable regression analysis of post-transplant variables (table 1) at day 90 show that a KPS0 episode by day 90) and cumulative dose of prednisone exceeding >2,650 mg are independent predictors of worse NRS. A KPS <80 and hypoalbuminemia (<3.0 g/dl), at day 90, are stronger predictors of survival than aGVHD, and should be considered when prognosticating outcome after allo-HCT.
