    "abstract_text": "Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) for allogeneic HSC transplantation but reconstitution of T cell immunity remains problematic even with double unit UCB transplantation (dUCBT). We previously reported that reconstitution of thymopoiesis plays a critical role in the clearance of CMV viremia, and is associated with improved overall survival in dUCBT recipients. Furthermore, we determined that T cell subset recovery after dUCBT depends on the production of IL-7 and SCF. In the present study we investigated whether thymic reconstitution after dUCBT depends on IL-7 and SCF and examined the prognostic role of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), IL-7 and SCF on clinical outcomes after dUCBT. We analyzed 52 adult patients with hematologic malignancies who enrolled in parallel Phase I/II clinical trials of dUCBT at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. Forty three patients received reduced intensity conditioning with fludarabine, melphalan and antithymocyte globulin; nine patients received myeloablative conditioning with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and TBI. Thirteen of these patients received human PTH and 13 patients received one untreated and one ex-vivo PGE 2 treated UCB unit, per study protocols. GvHD prophylaxis was tacrolimus in combination with sirolimus or mycophenolate mofetil. Assessments were performed at baseline (before conditioning) and at 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months after dUCBT. The median follow-up time among survivors was 71 months (range 24-96). The incidence of grade II-IV aGvHD was 15.4% and 14 out of 48 patients (29%) alive after 3 months developed cGvHD. The cumulative incidence of relapse at 5 years was 43%. The 5-year non-relapse mortality (NRM), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 31%, 26%, and 41% respectively. Plasma levels of IL-7 increased 3-fold from baseline at 1 month after dUCBT (median 26.4 pg/mL), remained elevated during the first three months, and gradually declined to pre-transplant levels by 1 year. SCF increased more slowly reaching peak levels at 2 months after dUCBT (median 1335.7 pg/mL), and gradually decreased thereafter. All but one evaluable patient had detectable TRECs at baseline with a median value of 3304 copies/ug DNA. TRECs were absent or extremely low during the first 3 months after dUCBT. At 6 months, 69.7% of patients had detectable TRECs, albeit below normal range (median value of 248 copies/ug DNA), but at 12 months 86.6% of the patients had detectable levels with a normal median value of 2404 copies/ug. We observed a statistically significant inverse correlation between IL-7 and TREC levels at 2 months after UCBT (r=-0.48, p=0.036). Similarly, SCF inversely correlated with TRECs at 6 months (r=-0.5, p=.004) and 12 months after dUCBT (r=-0.48, p=.02). We hypothesize that this inverse correlation is likely due to the uptake of IL-7 and SCF by thymocytes leading to their differentiation into TREC-containing Recent Thymic Emigrants (RTE). In support of this hypothesis, IL-7 and SCF inversely correlated with na\u00efve CD4CD45RA+ T cells at various time points after dUCBT. Next, we examined whether TREC, IL-7 and SCF levels might have a prognostic value for clinical outcomes after UCBT. In multivariable models, higher TREC levels were found to be independently associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) (p=0.02) and overall survival (OS) (p=0.02), and with less non-relapse mortality (NRM) (p=0.002). In contrast, higher levels of IL-7 and SCF were associated with lower OS (p=0.005 and p<.0001 respectively) and a trend towards lower PFS. Furthermore, higher levels of IL-7 and SCF were adverse prognostic factors for NRM (p=0.07 and p=0.007) but not for relapse. Taken together, our findings suggest that adult dUCBT recipients develop thymic reconstitution as early as 6 months after transplantation and TREC values correlate with improved clinical outcomes of dUCBT. In contrast, higher levels of IL-7 and SCF are associated with poor quantitative T cell and thymic reconstitution and they are negative prognostic factors for OS and NRM, which mainly reflects mortality due to infections and GvHD. These findings emphasize the link between cytokine-mediated immune reconstitution of post-thymic T cells and clinical outcomes of transplantation in adult dUCBT recipients.
