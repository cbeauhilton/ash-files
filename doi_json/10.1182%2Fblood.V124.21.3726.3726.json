    "abstract_text": "As they can kill Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) blasts in vitro and in vivo , Vg9Vd2T cells are key players in the design of new strategies of immunotherapy. AminoBisphonates (NBP) can enhance their activation in vitro and in vivo . Their combination with low-dose IL2 has shown promising results in 2 patients with AML who underwent partial remission. NBP treatment of blasts inhibits the Mevalonate pathway. The subsequent accumulation of Isopentenyl Diphosphate sensitize AML blasts to Vg9Vd2T cells killing but some AML cell lines blasts are resistant to this TCR mediated-lysis. Butyrophilin 3 A1 (BTN3A1) has been shown to be involved in IPP recognition and Vg9Vd2 T cells activation. Agonist monoclonal antibodies (mAb) recognizing the 3 isoforms of BTN3, can trigger BTN3 on tumor cell lines and sensitize them to Vg9Vd2 T cells lysis. We show that primary AML blasts from patient at diagnosis are heterogeneously killed by allogenic-IL-2-NBP-expanded Vg9Vd2 T. Some are resistant to this lysis and/or poorly sensitized by NBP. BTN3 molecules are highly expressed by blasts of AML cell lines and primary AML samples. We show that treatment of primary AML blasts with agonist anti-BTN3 mAb can overcome the resistance to Vg9Vd2 cells lysis in vitro . We assess this effect in vivo , showing that the addition of agonist anti-BTN3 mAb to Vg9Vd2 cells infusion decreased the tumor burden and increased the survival of NOG mice xenografted with luciferase-transduced U937 cell line. We confirm this effect in a model of mice xenografted with primary AML blasts, showing that treatment with anti-BTN3 mAb added to Vg9Vd2 cells infusion can decrease the number of blastic cells in the spleen, bone marrow and the blood, without requiring additional cytokine infusion. This drastic effect on sensitization of primary AML blasts to Vg9Vd2T cells killing could be of great interest especially in cases of refractory or relapsing AML.
