    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4007 Background: An increasing body of evidence in different organ systems suggests that the presence of the cytosolic enzyme Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH) correlates to stemcellness. Thus, in mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs), the side scatter low ALDH bright (SSC lo ALDH br ) population seems to be highly enriched for HSC as determined e.g. by Fallon et al 1 . However, these interesting preliminary findings need confirmation. Problem formulation: The generally accepted indirect relationship between CD34 content on the one hand, and successful hematopoietic regeneration after transplant on the other, is at least to a certain extent marred by the observation that, despite receiving sufficient weight-correlated amounts of CD34 positive HSC, some patients experience prolonged time to regeneration. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the number of CD34+SSC lo ALDH br is predictive of time to short and long-term regeneration following autologous bone marrow transplantation compared to the number of CD34+ cells alone. Results: PBSCs from 30 patients with refractory or relapsed diffuse large cell B-lymphoma referred for autologous stem cell transplantation after having failed at least three cytoreductive regimens were analyzed for ALDH expression. Laboratory results were registered on day 14 and day 100 post transplantation. Time to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) above 0,5 \u00d7 10 6 /mL on two consecutive days was registered for each of the 30 patients. While a trend was noted for number of reinfused viable CD34+ cells (10 6 /kg) to be correlated to ANC > 0,5 \u00d7 10 6 /mL r=0.33, P = 0.07), only the CD34+SSC lo ALDH br population correlated significantly to time to ANC > 0,5 \u00d7 10 6 /mL (r=0.41, P =0.024). Moreover, while a positive correlation was observed between both of the analyzed subpopulations and CFU-GM proliferation, this correlation was strongest for the number of reinfused CD34+SSC lo ALDH br /kg (r= 0.84, P 20 \u00d7 10 6 /mL on two consecutive days) an interesting finding emerged, when we considered day 100 platelet recoveries. Here, 11 patients were grouped as poor mobilizers (PM) having not attained a platelet count of 100 \u00d7 10 6 /mL at day 100, and 16 patients were grouped as good mobilizers (GM) while in three cases no data were available. While mere CD34 enumeration was once more not informative, we observed a trend towards low numbers of CD34+SSC lo ALDH br cells in the grafts in PM (p=0.06). With regard to long-term erythroid engraftment (defined as Hgb<100 g/L at day 100) 6 were PM (21 GM and data missing in 3) a significantly lower fraction of reinfused CD34+SSC lo ALDH br were administered to PM compared to GM (p=0.01). Once more, no significant difference in number of infused viable CD34+ cells between the groups was observed. Conclusion: In the autologous transplant setting the addition of SSC lo ALDH br to standard CD34 enumeration seems to constitute a valuable marker for the identification of both time to ANC > 0,5 \u00d7 10 6 /mL and inferior day +100 hematopoietic regeneration. While the assay does entail extra lab efforts, this layout is probably amply repaid by the possibility to institute pre-emptive therapy in PM patients. Moreover, application of the assay at the onset of leukapheresis sessions could provide a window of opportunity to administer alternative mobilization regimens, i.e. containing Plerixafor.
