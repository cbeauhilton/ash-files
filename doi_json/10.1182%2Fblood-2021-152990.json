    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Peripheral leukocyte deficiency is a common feature of multiple diseases and may render affected individuals susceptible to infections, both common and opportunistic. The CXCR4 chemokine receptor regulates the trafficking of leukocytes among the bone marrow, blood, and lymphatic system (Al Ustwani O, et al. Br J Haematol . 2014;164:15-23). Mavorixafor is an orally available investigational, small-molecule, selective antagonist of the CXCR4 receptor with potential to restore physiological trafficking and maturation of white blood cells (WBCs). Mavorixafor was previously shown to increase totals and subsets of WBCs in healthy volunteers and in a phase 2 clinical trial in adults with WHIM (Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections, Myelokathexis) syndrome (Stone N, et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother . 2007;51(7):2351-2358; Dale D, et al. Blood . 2020;136(26):2994-3003). Here, we report the effect of daily oral administration of mavorixafor on peripheral WBC counts and subsets in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), WHIM syndrome, and Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia (WM). Methods : Percentage changes in total peripheral WBC count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), and absolute monocyte count (AMC) from pretreatment levels were evaluated in the following settings: a phase 1/2 trial evaluating mavorixafor (200 mg twice daily or 400 mg once daily [QD]) in combination with axitinib (5 mg twice daily) in patients with advanced ccRCC who received \u22651 prior therapy; a phase 1b trial evaluating mavorixafor (400 mg QD) in combination with nivolumab (240 mg QD) in patients with metastatic ccRCC unresponsive to prior nivolumab monotherapy; a long-term extension of the aforementioned phase 2 trial evaluating mavorixafor 300 or 400 mg QD in patients with WHIM syndrome with pathogenic CXCR4 gain-of-function mutation and ANC \u2264400/\u03bcL and/or ALC \u2264650/\u03bcL; and an ongoing phase 1b trial evaluating mavorixafor (200 mg QD for 4 weeks, increased to 400 mg and 600 mg QD thereafter) in combination with ibrutinib (420 mg QD) in patients with WM with MYD88 and CXCR4 mutations. Results: In the study evaluating combination mavorixafor (400 mg QD) and axitinib in ccRCC, total WBC count, ANC, ALC, and AMC increased to 153%, 158%, 143%, and 182% of baseline after 4 weeks (n=49), and with increases sustained at 159%, 171%, 139% and 166% of baseline after 6 months' treatment (n=20). In the study evaluating mavorixafor in combination with nivolumab in ccRCC, total WBC count, ANC, ALC, and AMC increased to 146%, 143%, 141%, and 179% of baseline after 4 weeks (n=9), and with increases sustained at 147%, 136%, 152%, and 191% of baseline after 6 months (n=2). In an interim analysis of the phase 1b trial in WM, compared to screening values, total WBC count, ANC, ALC, and AMC increased to 192%, 170%, 219%, and 186% of baseline after 4 weeks (n=8), and with increases sustained at 163%, 192%, 106%, 172% of baseline after 6 months' (n=5) treatment. In the WHIM syndrome phase 2 extension, total WBC count, ANC, ALC, and AMC increased to 339%, 652%, 239%, and 486% of baseline after 6 months' (n=5) treatment, with annualized infection rate decreasing from 5.6 (SD \u00b1 3.13) events at baseline to 2.2 (SD \u00b1 0.93) events after 40 months. Mavorixafor was generally well tolerated, with manageable safety profile across all indications either alone or in combination with other drugs. Conclusions: Mavorixafor alone or in combination with other therapies is the first oral treatment to either acutely or chronically increase total peripheral WBCs 1.5- to 3-fold and WBC subsets across all disease populations examined, in both the presence (WHIM syndrome and WM) and absence (ccRCC and healthy volunteers) of CXCR4 gain-of-function mutation. Increases in WBC subsets occurred rapidly and were sustained during chronic treatment, with a larger treatment effect in patients with pre-existing cytopenia (WHIM syndrome) compared to patients without cytopenia at baseline (ccRCC and WM). Co-occurring reduction in infection burden was observed in the phase 2 trial in WHIM syndrome. Assessment of the beneficial effects of mavorixafor on total and WBC subsets is ongoing in a phase 3 trial of WHIM syndrome and a phase 1 trial of severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) that will assess the potential to correct cytopenias by elevating total WBC counts.
