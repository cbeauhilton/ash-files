    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1372 Background: Chemotherapy resistance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) can be mediated by anti-apoptotic signals produced by stromal or nurse-like cells. Developing strategies to overcome this resistance is hindered by the lack of suitable \u201cstromal\u201d targets responsible for these signals. We have discovered that erythroid differentiation regulator 1 ( ERDR1 ) may be a candidate target for such a strategy. In this study, we show Erdr1 is generated by several stromal cell types including bone marrow stromal cells, fibrocytes, and nurse-like cells. Furthermore, inhibition of stroma-generated Erdr1 results in increased apoptosis of co-cultured CLL cells. Methods/Results: We initially identified Erdr1 on an Affymetrix array that compared the gene expression of wild type and CCR5 -/- mice with pulmonary metastasis. The increased expression of Erdr1 in the wild type mice was particularly pronounced in the pulmonary mesenchymal cells. Therefore, these cells were transfected with one of two shRNAs (shRNA #9 or shRNA#11) and the survival of these cells was compared with mesenchymal cells transfected with a non-targeted control vector. After 15 days in culture, the control cells expanded normally; however, no significant expansion was seen in either the shRNA#9 or shRNA#11 transfected cells. These differences in cellular expansion were associated with differences in apoptosis. 21.4+1.6% of the Erdr1 knockdown cells were annexin V + compared to 11.2+1.9% of the non-targeted control ( p<0.03) . Using GFP as a marker for transfection, we were also able to show that knockdown of Erdr1 increased the apoptosis of surrounding non-transfected mesenchymal cells. Thus, Erdr1 is a critical protein for the survival of stromal cells. Further analysis of the mesenchymal cell subpopulations revealed the greatest expression of Erdr1 in the CD45 + , thy1.1 +/\u2212 fibrocytes. When compared to CD45 - fibroblasts, the fibrocytes expressed CCR5 and increased Erdr1 expression by 14.2+/\u22122.9 fold when treated with the CCR5 ligand CCL4. Given the similarities between fibrocytes and nurse-like cells, we went on to measure the effect of Erdr1 inhibition on CLL cells. In these experiments, stable Erdr1 knockdown and control clones were selected after the transfection of the bone marrow stromal cell line M2-10B4. These clones were then co-cultured with primary CLL cells. At 96 hours, leukemia cells co-cultured with the control lines had expanded by 1.33 + 0.9 compared to 0.74 + 0.22 fold in the knock-down lines ( p<0.03 ). As before, the lack of cellular expansion was associated with an increase in apoptosis. To further show the relevance of these findings to CLL, we demonstrated that human fibrocytes and nurse-like cells expressed mRNA and protein for ERDR1 in all patient samples tested. Implications for the treatment of human disease: Our data demonstrate that ERDR1 is a critically important protein for the survival of nurse-like cells. These data suggest that targeting ERDR1 or the upstream pathway through CCR5 might be a novel approach for the treatment of CLL. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
