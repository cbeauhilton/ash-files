    "abstract_text": "Objective Arterial and venous thrombosis are reported to be common in critically ill COVID-19 patients. This study aims to describe the thrombotic and bleeding rates in COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) in Singapore. Design Retrospective observational study involving all consecutive adult COVID-19 patients who required ICU admission between 23 January 2020 and 30 April 2020. Setting National multicenter study involving all eight public hospitals in Singapore. Patients 111 consecutive COVID-19 patients who required ICU admission were included. Measurements and Main Results Primary outcome was any venous or arterial thrombotic events occurred in ICU. Other measures included (1) the overall, venous and arterial thrombotic events throughout the hospitalisation, (2) major and minor bleeding events. The overall thrombotic rate in ICU was 11.7% (n=13), with 1.8% (n=2) venous and 9.9% (n=11) arterial events. The overall thrombotic rates throughout hospitalisation, censored at 30 April 2020, increased to 18.0% (n=20) with 6.3% (n=7) venous and 11.7% (n=13) arterial events. Major and minor bleeding rates were 14.8% (n=16) and 3.7% (n=4), respectively. Two-third of the patients received pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in ICU. Conclusions Critically ill COVID-19 patients in Singapore have lower VTE but higher arterial thrombosis rates with higher bleeding manifestations than other reported cohorts. Standard thromboprophylaxis may be sufficient to prevent thrombotic complications in patients with similar demographics. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
