    "abstract_text": "Abstract 365 Background: Translocations of the Mixed Lineage Leukemia ( MLL ) gene occur in a subset (5%) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in mixed phenotype acute leukemia in infancy, a disease with extremely poor prognosis. Animal model systems show that MLL gain of function mutations may contribute to leukemogenesis. Wild-type MLL carries histone methyltransferase activity and affects specific target genes, such us HOXA cluster genes. While the more than three dozen MLL fusion proteins known today exert different specific functions, they finally induce transcription of individual target genes. Consequently, acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) with MLL mutations ( MLL mu) exhibit typical gene expression profiles including high-level expression of HOXA cluster genes. Aim of this study was to find a correlation between the MLL mutational status and tumor suppressor gene methylation/expression in acute leukemia cell lines. Results: Using MS-MLPA (methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay), methylation of 24 different TSG was analyzed in 28 MLL mu and MLL wt acute leukemia cell lines. 1.8/24 TSG were methylated in MLL mu AML cells, 6.2/24 TSG were methylated in MLL wt AML cells. Hypomethylation and expression of the tumor suppressor genes (TSG) BEX2 , IGSF4 and TIMP3 turned out to be characteristic of MLL mu acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. MLL wild-type ( MLL wt) AML cell lines displayed hypermethylated TSG promoters resulting in transcriptional silencing. Demethylating agents and inhibitors of histone deacetylases restored expression of BEX2 , IGSF4 and TIMP3 confirming epigenetic silencing of these genes in MLL wt cells. The positive correlation between MLL translocation, TSG hypomethylation and expression suggested that MLL fusion proteins were responsible for dysregulation of TSG expression in MLL mu cells. This concept was supported by our observation that Bex2 mRNA levels in MLL-ENL transgenic mouse cell lines required expression of the MLL fusion gene. Conclusion: These results suggest that the conspicuous expression of the TSG BEX2, IGSF4 and TIMP3 in MLL mu AML cell lines is the consequence of altered epigenetic properties of MLL fusion proteins.
