In vitro , navitoclax shows potent targeted cytotoxicity (EC 50 \u2264 1\u03bcM) against T and B lymphoid malignancies that over-express Bcl-2. A phase 1 trial demonstrated oral navitoclax monotherapy to be well-tolerated and to have anti-tumor activity in patients (pts) with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, thrombocytopenia (TCP) was the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Phase 3 studies showed improved outcomes in CLL pts with the fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/rituximab (FCR) combination, and a phase 2 trial showed bendamustine/rituximab (BR) to be effective for pts with relapsed or refractory CLL. Navitoclax enhanced R (monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy) efficacy in preclinical models of B-cell lymphoma. Methods: This is an ongoing, international, phase 1 dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral navitoclax in combination with FCR (Arm A) or BR (Arm B) in pts with relapsed/refractory CLL. Secondary objectives are efficacy endpoints (PFS, ORR, TTP, OS, duration of response). Eligible pts had measurable disease, ECOG performance score \u22641, ANC \u2265100/\u03bcL, platelets \u2265100,000/mm 3 , and hemoglobin \u22659.0 g/dL. Preliminary results are reported. After obtaining informed consent, pts were assigned to Arm A or Arm B based on physician preference, each consisting of 28-day dose-escalation cycles with once-daily, pre-infusion, navitoclax treatment on Days 3\u20135 of Cycle 1 and Days 1\u20133 of subsequent cycles. In both arms, R was 375 mg/m 2 on Day 1 of Cycle 1; and 500 mg/m 2 on Day 2 of Cycle 2 and on Day 1 of subsequent cycles. In Arm A, F 25 mg/m 2 and C 175 mg/m 2 were dosed on Days 2\u20134 in Cycles 1 and 2, and on Days 1\u20133 in subsequent cycles. In Arm B, B was dosed at 70 mg/m 2 on Days 2 and 3 of Cycles 1 and 2, and on Days 1 and 2 in subsequent cycles. Navitoclax starting dose was 110 mg daily. Dose escalation to the next cohort (200 mg) was according to a continuous reassessment model. Tumor responses were evaluated using NCI-WG 1996 criteria. Pts could continue on navitoclax therapy for 1 yr in the absence of progressive disease or significant toxicity. Results: As of July 2010, 7 pts enrolled in the initially prioritized Arm B (BR+navitoclax); all completed the first cohort of 110 mg (median age 60 yr [range 55\u201372]). Study sites are currently enrolling pts in Arm A (FCR+navitoclax); 2 pts have enrolled to date. The median number of prior therapies was 2 (range 1\u20137). One pt had a DLT of elevated AST (Arm B, 110 mg cohort) and 1 pt had a DLT of neutropenic fever (Arm A, 110 mg cohort). In Arm B, neither TCP nor neutropenia have been DLTs. For the 7 pts with navitoclax-related AEs, the most common were diarrhea (3 pts), nausea (5 pts), and fatigue (3 pts). Seven pts remain on study; 2 pts discontinued due to disease progression and 2 withdrew per physician preference. In Arm B, preliminary antitumor best responses were assessable in 4 pts who received 2 cycles; 1 CRi in a pt with del17p- (based on lymph node [LN] response and no morphologic evidence of CLL in the bone marrow), 2 unconfirmed CRs (based on LN response and no bone marrow at this time), and 1 PR in a pt with del17p- (this pt subsequently received an allogeneic stem cell transplant). Preliminary PK results for the Arm B 110 mg cohort indicated that navitoclax PK was similar in Cycle 1 (navitoclax+BR) and Cycle 2 (navitoclax alone), and appeared comparable to PK in the navitoclax monotherapy study. Conclusions: Early results show that the combination of navitoclax with BR is well-tolerated, without DLTs of TCP or neutropenia, and show evidence of anti-tumor activity. Data are limited in the FCR portion of the study. The maximum tolerated dose of navitoclax has not been reached. Accrual is ongoing and following completion of the dose-escalation components of this study, expanded cohorts of pts will be assessed using the recommended phase 2 dose of navitoclax to further assess the tolerability and dose, and to continue to explore for efficacy signals in combinations. Preliminary data in combination with BR are encouraging. Disclosures: Kipps: Abbott Laboratories: Research Funding; Genentech/Roche: Research Funding.
