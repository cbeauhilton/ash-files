    "abstract_text": "Heterobifunctional proteolysis-targeting chimeric compounds leverage the activity of E3 ligases (e.g. CRBN and VHL ) to induce neopmorphic ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of target oncoproteins, with potent preclinical activity against diverse neoplasias. Despite intense recent efforts to develop pharmacological \"degraders\" against many different oncoproteins, the mechanisms regulating tumor cell sensitivity to different classes of these \"degraders\" remain incompletely understood. To address this question in an unbiased manner, we performed genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing loss-of-function (LOF) studies in MM.1S multiple myeloma (MM) cells treated with CRBN-mediated degraders of BET bromodomain proteins (dBET6) or CDK9 (Thal-SNS-032); or with VHL-mediated degraders of BET bromodomain proteins (ARV-771 or MZ-1). We observed that MM cell resistance to any of these \"degraders\" does not involve genes with recurrent LOF in MM patients and association with high-risk MM (e.g. for TP53 , PTEN , negative regulators of cell cycle, et.c.), suggesting that these degraders may exhibit activity against tumor cells with prognostically adverse genetic features. In tumor cells resistant to the CRBN-mediated degraders dBET6 and Thal-SNS-032, we observed significant enrichment of sgRNAs targeting CRBN itself or (to a lesser extent) other components or regulators of its cullin RING ligase ( CRL CUL4A ) complex, including members of the COP9 signalosome ( COPS7A , COPS7B , COPS2 , COPS3 , COPS8 , GPS1 , etc.), DDB1 , or the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBE2G1. In tumor cells resistant to the VHL-mediated degraders MZ-1 and ARV-771, we observed pronounced enrichment of sgRNAs for CUL2 , VHL itself, other members (e.g. RBX1 , elongin B/C [ TCEB1 , TCEB2 ] of the CUL2 complex with VHL), as well as COP9 signalosome genes ( COPS7B , COPS8 ) and UBE2R2 . We also validated, using individual sgRNAs for several of these candidate genes that their CRISPR knockout can decrease tumor cell response to dBET6 and Thal-SNS-032 treatment (e.g. for CRBN , COPS7B, COPS2 , or COPS8) or MZ-1 and ARV-771 (e.g. for VHL , COP7B and COPS8 ). Notably, the sgRNAs against COP9 signalosome genes conferred less pronounced decrease in sensitivity to VHL-, than CRBN-based, degraders, suggesting that COP9 signalosome loss has differential roles in the function of CUL4A CRBN vs. CUL2 VHL and potentially other CRL complexes. Tumor cells isolated from our CRISPR knockout screens with confirmed resistance to a given degrader were then treated with other degraders operating through the same or different E3 ligase; and against the same or different oncoprotein: we observed cross-resistance between degraders operating through the same E3 ligase against different oncoproteins, but not for degraders targeting the same protein via different E3 ligase/CRLs: this result is consistent with our observation for substantial gene-level differences (despite pathway-level similarities) for resistance mechanisms for CRBN- vs. VHL-based degraders. In conclusion, our study systematically defined at genome-scale the resistance mechanisms of tumor cells against degraders which leverage the same E3 ligase against different targets; or target the same oncoprotein through different E3 ligases/CRL complexes. We observed that for multiple types of degraders, tumor cell resistance is primarily mediated by prevention of, rather than adaptation to, breakdown of the target oncoprotein. The observed pathway-level similarities and major individual gene-level differences in resistance mechanisms for CRBN- and VHL-mediated degraders likely reflects the different composition and regulation of the respective CRL complexes mediating the action of these classes of degraders Our observations suggest that preventing or delaying resistance to pharmacological degradation of oncoproteins may require concurrent or sequential/alternating use of degraders operating through different E3 ligases and ideally, different CRL complexes; while synthetic lethal strategies to prevent COP9 signalosome LOF may also be contemplated to counteract a common, but quantitatively less pronounced, potential mechanism of resistance for several different classes of degraders. Collectively, our study highlights important new directions in the development of new pharmacological degraders for blood cancers and other neoplasias.
