    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4265 Background: High-dose melphalan (MEL) followed by autologous stem cell support has been an integral component of multiple myeloma (MM) therapy since the 1980's. In general, high-dose melphalan is well-tolerated however grade 3 and 4 mucositis has been reported in up to 75% of patients (Lilleby et al. Bone Marrow Transpl, 2006). The efficacy of cryotherapy in preventing mucositis was initially documented in patients receiving infusional 5- fluorouracil (Rubenstein et al. Cancer, 2004). It is presumed that vasoconstriction reduces exposure of the oral mucosa to chemotherapy. Due to similar pharmacokinetic properties of melphalan including its short half life, cryotherapy has been used in MM patients undergoing MEL and stem cell transplant (SCT) with small series and one randomized trial supporting its use (Lilleby et al. Bone Marrow Transpl, 2006). At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, ice chips administered for 30 minutes before, during and after melphalan administration was adopted in March 2011 for all MM patients receiving MEL (\u2265 140 mg/m 2 ). In this study we sought to determine if the incidence of mucositis has been reduced since instituting cryotherapy into our standard practice. Methods: We retrospectively identified MM patients who received MEL 140 or 200 mg/m 2 prior to SCT between January 1, 2009 and June 12, 2012 using our pharmacy database and electronic medical record. We analyzed two groups of patients by date of SCT and confirmed that patients transplanted prior to 3/2011 did not receive cryotherapy while all others did. Mucositis grade was recorded as documented by medical staff or determined by the investigators using the CTCAE version 4 criteria. Disease and treatment characteristics were collected in addition to narcotic use, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) requirement, and days of hospitalization. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the proportion of patients with mucositis, severe mucositis (defined as grade 3 or higher) and those requiring patient controlled analgesia (PCA), by cryotherapy use. Logistic regression was used to adjust for prior radiation and the number of prior lines of therapy. The number of hospital days was compared using a t-test. Results: During the study period, 214 patients underwent one or more autologous SCTs for MM; for patients who had more than one, only the initial SCT was included in this analysis. Of 214 patients, 85 (40%) received cryotherapy of whom 34% developed mucositis compared to 47% who did not receive cryotherapy ( P = 0.08). Grade 3 mucositis was seen in 2% and 16% of patients who did and did not receive cryotherapy respectively ( P = 0.004). No patient in either group developed grade 4 mucositis. After adjusting for radiation and lines of prior therapy the association between grade 3 mucositis and cryotherapy remained significant (OR: 0.13 (0.02, 0.47); P = 0.01). PCA use was lower in patients who received cryotherapy (19%) compared to those who did not (37%) ( P = 0.01), with the median duration of use being 5 days in both groups. TPN was not required for any patient. Hospital days were similar in both groups ( P = 0.88). Conclusion: Cryotherapy administration at the time of high-dose melphalan reduces the incidence of severe mucositis and PCA use. Cryotherapy is readily available and should be offered to all MM patients receiving \u2265 140 mg/m 2 of melphalan.
