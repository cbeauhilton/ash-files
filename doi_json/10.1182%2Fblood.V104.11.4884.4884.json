    "abstract_text": "We investigated the relevance of p53 deletions to the clinical outcome of multiple myeloma (MM) patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Hemizygous p53 gene deletions were detected by cytoplasmic Ig-enhanced interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (cIg-FISH) in 10 of 105 (9.5%) patients studied. p53 deletions were associated with higher serum calcium (p=0.0062) and creatinine (p=0.013) levels but there were no association with patient age, gender, \u03b2-2 microglobulin, C-reactive protein, hemoglobin, albumin, bone lytic lesions, or immunoglobulin isotype. There were no association of p53 deletions with chromosome 13q deletions, translocation t(11;14) or t(4;14). The overall response rates were similar in patients with and without p53 deletions (67% vs 71%). However, patients with p53 deletions had significantly shorter progression free (median 7.9 vs . 25.7 months, p=0.0324) and overall survival (median 14.7 vs . 48.1 months, p=0.0008) than patients without a p53 deletion. A multivariate analysis confirmed p53 deletion was an independent prognostic factor predicting shortened progression free (p=0.0009) or overall survival (p=0.0002) in myeloma patients after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation."
