    "abstract_text": "Background: The clinical outcome of transfusion-dependent TM patients with iron overload has been shown to depend on the dose and frequency of deferoxamine (DFO) use. However, the demanding regimen of slow subcutaneous infusions often leads to poor compliance. Deferasirox (Exjade \u00ae ), a once-daily oral chelator, has potential compliance advantages. Doses of 20\u201330 mg/kg/day are non-inferior to DFO >35 mg/kg in TM patients with baseline liver iron concentration (LIC) >7 mg Fe/g dry weight (dw). This analysis reports efficacy and safety data from TM patients with iron overload who received DFO in a 1-year core trial (107), and then switched to deferasirox in an ongoing 4-year extension trial (107E). Methods: TM patients with iron overload \u22652 years of age were randomized to DFO or deferasirox in study 107. Patients with LIC <7 or \u22657 mg Fe/g dw received DFO <25\u2013<35 or 35-\u226550 mg/kg, respectively, but some patients with baseline LIC <7 mg Fe/g dw remained on their higher pre-study DFO doses since these were efficacious. Patients completing the 1-year core trial had a repeat LIC assessment by biopsy or SQUID, and were continued on or switched to deferasirox during 107E for long term efficacy and safety evaluation. Deferasirox dose was based on the end of 1-year LIC, and adjusted according to trends in serum ferritin (SF) level. Efficacy and safety data were analyzed annually for patients receiving DFO in study 107 who switched to deferasirox in 107E, to determine long-term outcome. Results: 259 patients, 129 children (2\u20137 mg Fe/g dw in 85 and 174 patients, respectively. Median SF change after 12 months of DFO was \u2212264 ng/mL (baseline 2037 ng/mL). Patients crossed over to deferasirox and have received treatment for a median of 35.2 months. At month 42 of deferasirox, median SF had further decreased by \u2212257 ng/mL (baseline 1843 ng/mL) in a dose-related manner (Figure 1). Figure 1.

One patient had a serious drug-related AE. Three patients (1.2%) had an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase >10 \u00d7 ULN on at least one visit, where baseline ALT values were normal, \u22651\u2013<5 \u00d7 ULN and \u22655\u2013<10 \u00d7 ULN. Irrespective of relationship to DFO, deafness, tinnitus and hypoacusis were reported in five, four and three patients, while five and one had lenticular opacities and maculopathy, respectively. During year 1 of deferasirox treatment the most common drug-related AEs were rash (n=17, 6.6%), diarrhea (n=11, 4.2%) and nausea (n=7, 2.7%); the annual frequency of these drug-related AEs decreased to 33% above baseline and ULN on two consecutive visits, with a subsequent overall annual incidence of 2\u20133%. In year 1, four patients (1.5%) had an ALT increase >10\u00d7ULN on at least one visit (baseline values were \u22651\u201310\u00d7ULN were reported thereafter. Irrespective of relationship to deferasirox, hypoacusis, deafness and tinnitus were seen in four, two and one patients, respectively, and one had lenticular opacities. Conclusions: TM patients who have previously received chelation therapy with DFO can maintain effective chelation when switched to deferasirox, as demonstrated by a continued and dose-dependent decrease in SF. Over long-term deferasirox treatment with increased dose, there was no increased risk of toxicity, no evidence of progressive renal or liver dysfunction and an annual decrease in drug-related AEs.",
