    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3567 Autologous transplantation significantly improves the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with relapsed or resistant follicular (rFL) lymphoma compared with chemotherapy alone (Schouten H, et al. J Clin Oncol 2003;21:3918\u201327). Small phase II trials suggest, that rituximab (R) given peritransplant further improves survival outcome. Whilst the role of maintenance R post chemotherapy in FL is established, the benefit and safety of maintenance R following autologous transplant is unknown. In this randomised prospective study the efficacy and safety of R as in vivo purging pretransplant and as maintenance treatment immediately post transplant was assessed. From Oct 1999 to Apr 2006, 280 of a planned 420 R nai\u0308ve patients with rFL in first (n=16), second (n= 222) or third remission (n=41) who achieved either a complete remission (n=83) or a very good partial remission (n=196) to induction chemotherapy, with limited bone marrow infiltration (<25% B-lymphocytes) underwent a single randomisation in a 2 \u00d7 2 design to R purging 375 mg/m 2 weekly \u00d7 4 (RP) before high-dose therapy with BEAM conditioning (HDC) and maintenance R 375 mg/m 2 every 3 months for 2 years (RM). The primary endpoint of the study was PFS. All analysis is by intention to treat. The median age was 51 years (range: 26\u201370), and baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups. On average patients were 44.1 (range 3.4\u2013463.8) months from diagnosis with 79.3% having 2 lines of therapy and 15% three lines of prior therapy. Patients were equally distributed between low, intermediate and high FLIPI scores. Pretransplant 70% of patients were in PR and 30% in CR. Fifty seven patients failed to mobilise peripheral blood stem cells. Nineteen patients withdrew, 5 due to toxicity, 9 were ineligible. In the 196 (70%) patients transplanted, neutrophil engraftment > 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L was prompt, median 14.3 days (range 10\u2013115) and platelets > 50 \u00d7 10 9 /L,median 25.1 days (range 9\u2013190). Time to engraftment and early or late toxicities did not differ significantly between the groups apart from a lower neutrophil count at 3 months in patients on maintenance. No graft failures or late neutropenia was reported. Transplant related mortality was 0.5%. Only 3 infection related deaths have been reported post 100 days. Two hundred and seventeen patients are alive on continued follow-up. Median follow-up is 6.4 years. PFS at 5 years was 62.9% for patients receiving RP + RM versus 37.6 % for patients receiving no R (logrank PFS; p=0.004; HR 0.76, 95%CI: 0.66 \u2013 0.93). OS at 5 years was 79.5% % versus 78.4 % for patient receiving RP + RM versus no R (logrank PFS; p>0.1). Multivariate analysis was not able to define a high or low risk patient group. R in vivo purging and maintenance results in superior PFS compared to no R. R does not adversely affect peripheral blood stem cell harvesting or engraftment and maintenance R post transplant is safe. The impressive OS suggests that relapsed FL patients can be effectively salvaged post R purging and maintenance.  . R Purging + R Maintenance . R Maintenance . R Purging . No R .
