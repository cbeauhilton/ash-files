    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4115 Introduction: Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, skin changes associated with a paraproteinaemia (POEMS syndrome) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome secondary to a plasma cell dyscrasia. Effective treatment, including ASCT, of the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia can control the disease and often dramatically control symptoms. Limited data is available for ASCT in POEMS. Specific Aim: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical outcome of ASCT for patients with POEMS syndrome, determining the impact of patient and disease-specific factors on prognosis. The incidence of engraftment syndrome and the presentation of relapse were examined. Methodology: Patient-, disease-, and transplant-related variables were collected according to the data entries in the EBMT database, including tracking incomplete data entries from participating centers. Results: 116 patients underwent an ASCT between 1997\u20132009 and satisfied the entry criteria. The median age was 50 yrs (range 26\u201369) with 56.8% of patients '50 year of age. 58.6% had peripheral neuropathy, 66.2% volume overload, 48.3% had organomegaly, 19.8% had papiloedema, 46.6% had dermopathies and 34.5% had sclerotic bone lesions at presentation. The median time from diagnosis to ASCT was 7.8 mns (range 1\u2013346) with 34.5% of patients receiving an ASCT >12 months from diagnosis. The graft source was PBSC in 100% of patients. Disease status at ASCT was: 32% CR/PR, 30% SD/MR/untreated and 5 in PD. Missing information on stage in 33% of the cases. The conditioning regimen was Melphalan \u2265200mg/m 2 in 52.5%, Melphalan <200mg/m 2 in 9.3% (38.1 of data on dose is missing) and TBI-containing only 1 patient. Engraftment was seen in 112 (96.6%) patients with failed engraftment reported in 3 patients (2.5%). Details of the occurrence of engraftment syndrome are currently under collection and analysis though peri-engraftment fever was reported in 23.4% and pulmonary infiltrates in 4.8%. Haematological response was characterized as CR in 31%, PR in 20.7%, <PR in 20.7% and currently unknown in 27.6%. Best disease response, in terms of end-organ response is under evaluation. With a median follow-up of 30.1 mns (range 0.1\u2013161), 90.5 % of patients are alive and only 8.6% of patients have relapsed. The non-relapse mortality was 6.9%. Causes of death: 5 died of infection, 2 from graft failure, 1 from cardiac toxicity. The 3-year probabilities of PFS and OS are 82% and 94%, respectively. The 5-year probabilities of PFS and OS are 80% and 92%, respectively. The data analyzed in this study, to-date, demonstrates that ASCT can be an effective and safe therapeutic modality for patients with POEMS syndrome. The role of high dose therapy compared with more conventional dose therapies warrants further investigation. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
