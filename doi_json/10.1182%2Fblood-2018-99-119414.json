    "abstract_text": "Background. The main mechanism of the bone marrow (BM) failure in idiopathic aplastic anemia (AA) has an immunomediated character. Researching the T-cell clone's effect in the AA pathogenesis is very relevant at the present time. Oligoclonal expansion of T cells is frequent in AA and the identification of immunodominant T-cell clones can correlate with the disease activity and may possibly serve as response predictor to immunosuppressive therapy (IST). The aim. To identify T-cells subpopulations, expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 on T-cells and TCR-V\u03b2 repertoires by flow cytometry in different groups of AA patients. Methods. Thirty AA patients (pts) with median age of 30.5 (19-71), m/f ratio 1:1,3 were divided in 3 groups: pts with newly diagnosed (ND) AA (n=13), pts with overall response to IST (OR) (n=10), non-response pts (NR) for 2 and more lines of IST (n=7). Flow cytometry was performed with BD FACS Canto II. We used commercial kit (IOTest\u00ae Beta Mark TCR Vb Repertoire) for evaluation of TCR-V\u03b2 repertoire in the bone marrow (BM) of these patients. We performed analysis of BM samples from healthy donors as a control group (n=8). Due to low amount of donor samples the maximal value each of the 24 subclones (for CD4+ (T-helpers - Th) and CD8+ cells (T-cytotoxic cells - TCL)) was accepted as threshold. We concluded the presence of clonal expansion if TCR subclone exceeded this threshold. We identified different T-cell subpopulations in all 3 groups of AA and healthy donors by flow cytometry: double positive T-cells (CD3+CD4+CD8+), double negative T-cells (CD3+CD4- CD8-), Th (CD3+CD4+), TCL (CD3+CD8+), NK-T-cells (CD3+CD56+) out of CD3+ cells. Among Th and TCL cells was determined naive T-cells (CD28+CD95-), effector T-cells (CD28-CD95+), memory T-cells (CD28+CD95+), regulatory T-cells (CD4+CD127-CD25high) and subpopulations Th and TCL co-expressed PD-1 and PD-L1 . Multiple comparisons were assessed by ANOVA or Kruskal Wallis test by GraphPad Prism software. Results. In our study all 30 AA patients had an immunodominant TCR-V\u03b2 clones among Th and/or TCL cells. We identified the most common clonotypes in comparison with healthy donors - V\u03b21, V\u03b22, V\u03b23 among the Th cells and V\u03b23, V\u03b29, V\u03b213.1 among the TCL cells. In ND group V\u03b21 was highly expanded in 5 (38.5%), V\u03b23 - in 7 (53.8%) pts among Th, and V\u03b23 - in 3 (23.1%) and V\u03b29 - in 4 (30.8%) out of 13 pts among TCL. In OR group V\u03b22 expansion was in 4 (40%) and V\u03b23 - in 5 (50%) pts among Th; V\u03b23 in 6 (60%) and V\u03b29 in 6 (60%) out of 10 pts among TCL. In NR group the most frequent was V\u03b213.1 clone in TCL - in 3 (42.9%) out of 7 pts. In NR group in overall clonal expansion was less frequent than in ND and OR groups. We also analyzed the previously mentioned subpopulations of T-cells in patients with AA in three groups (ND, OR, NR) compared to healthy donors (table 1). We obtained significant differences in the count of naive Th and TCL cells, memory T-cells in all three groups of AA patients compared to donors: proportion of naive Th and TCL cells was significantly higher and proportion of memory Th cells was lower in the donor group than in AA pts. The percent of TCL effectors was higher in ND AA pts compare to donors. We also found that cell count of activated Th (CD4+CD25+) was higher in the group of refractory pts. In OR pts proportion of PD-1-positive Th was higher than in donors. In NR pts Th and TCL co-expressed with PD-L1 were lower compare to donors (table 1). Conclusions. In our study we found immunodominant clonotypes in different AA pts and depletion of the pool of naive T cells. Dynamic observation of changes in the most common clonotypes in AA pts during treatment will provide suitable therapy tactics (allogenic bone marrow transplantation or IST).
