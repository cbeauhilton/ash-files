    "abstract_text": "Abstract 131 Introduction. Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) after cytoreductive induction is considered standard of care for younger patients (pts) with multiple myeloma (MM). The previous standard of induction, the Vincristin-Adriamycin-Dexamethasone (VAD) combination, achieves inferior results compared with induction regimens which combine the proteasome inhibitor Velcade (V = Bortezomib) with Dexamethasone (D)(=VD) and a cytostatic drug such as Doxorubicin (PAD = VD plus Doxorubicin). Velcade-based induction therapy was shown to translate into better myeloma control after high dose melphalan and to lead to prolonged progression-free survival. In order to find a more efficacious and safer drug combination for induction therapy in MM, we tested the combination of Velcade with Cyclophosphamide and Dexamethasone (VCD). Methods. This trial was designed as an open, prospective, multi-center, uncontrolled, combined phase II/III study. As previously reported (Kropff M et al., Ann Hematol 2009), in the first 30 pts the optimal dose of iv Cyclophosphamide in combination with V and D was defined as 900 mg/m2 on d1. Between 03/2006 and 03/2009 we enrolled an additional 370 pts up to 60 years of age with untreated MM to receive three 3-week cycles of induction treatment with V 1.3 mg/m2 iv d1,4,8,11; D 40 mg/d orally d1,2,4,5,8,9,11,12; and C 900mg/m2 iv d1 before scheduled high dose melphalan and ASCT. The primary endpoint of the study is response rate on day 63 after 3 cycles of VCD according to EBMT and IMWG criteria. Results. Final data from 400 pts from 39 German centers will be presented at the meeting. In the currently evaluable 300 pts (mean age 52.3 years; 1.7% stage I, 21.3% stage II, 77.0% stage III) molecular cytogenetic analysis showed a prevalence of 13q- in 38%, of t[4;14] in 13% and of 17p- in 12% of pts (no changes in 35%). All 300 pts (88.3% of whom completed three cycles) were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Overall response rate (ORR = CR+PR) was 84%, with 10% CR and 74% PR, 5.7% MR, 7.3% NC and 2.3% PD. The negative prognostic impact of 13q- or t[4;14] was abrogated (ORR normal 87.3%, 13q- 83.7%, t[4;14] 90.0%), the unfavorable influence of p53 loss in the 17p- subgroup was still detectable (ORR 69.2%) but this did not reach statistical significance. VGPR rates will be reported at the meeting. Serious adverse events were documented in 78/300 (26.0%) patients. Death rate was remarkably low (1.3%, of which one was not related to the trial medication). 155/300 (52%) of pts experienced grade 3/4 non-serious AEs and of these leucopenia (93/300 pts= 31%), thrombocytopenia (7%), neutropenia (6%), anaemia (5%) were the most frequent events. 80 AEs grade 3 or 4 and 45 SAEs were of infectious origin and occurred in 47/300 pts. 80/130 SAEs (61.5%) were at least possibly related to Velcade. 101/300 pts (34%) developed episodes of peripheral neuropathy. PNP was grade 1 in 62/300 pt (20.7%), grade 2 in 31/300 pt (10.3%) and grade 3 in 7/300 pts (2.3%). Conclusion. This analysis demonstrates that proteasome inhibition by Velcade in combination with Dexamethasone and iv Cyclophosphamide (VCD) is an induction regimen for newly diagnosed MM which is highly effective in a short period of time, has a rather low toxicity profile and is feasible for administration in an outpatient setting. Based on these characteristics, VCD qualifies to become a new standard for MM induction therapy.
