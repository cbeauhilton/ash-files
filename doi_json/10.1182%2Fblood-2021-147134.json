    "abstract_text": "Objective: To report 2 cases of relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma with bulky lung involvement who failed PD-1 blockade, obtained long-term complete remission after treatment with PD-1 blockade in combination with ICE chemotherapy, and provide an alternative regimen for this kind of patient. Methods: The clinical data of 2 patients suffering refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma with bulky lung involvement who were resistant to PD-1 monoclonal antibody were collected, the treatment processes, efficacy and toxic side effects of the patients were summarized. Results: Both HL patients relapsed after multi-line chemotherapies and radiotherapy. One patient relapsed after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The main manifestations were cough and dyspnea caused by large lung masses. Both patients received 3 kinds of PD-1 blockade. One progressed after stopping Nivolumab and enrolled the clinical trial of decitabine and Camrelizumab for 6 courses and got stable disease\uff08SD\uff09, then changed to Camrelizumab combined with ICE for 4 cycles and obtain complete metabolic remission\uff08CMR\uff09. The other patient progressed with Nivolumab or Camrelizumab combined with A (B) VD regimen, and 2 courses of BV. She was then treated with Sintilimab combined with ICE for 4 cycles and obtain CMR. Both patients' cough and dyspnea were significantly improved, and lung lesions were significantly reduced after receiving 1 cycle of PD-1 blockade with ICE regimen and the quality of life was greatly improved. After 4 courses of treatment, the PET/CT assessment achieved CMR. The main side effect was a second-degree bone marrow suppression and can be tolerable for the patient. Conclusion: PD-1 blockade combined with ICE regimen chemotherapy has significant curative effect and mild adverse reactions, can be used to treat cases of relapsed or refractory classic HL with bulky lung involvement resistant to PD-1 blockade.
