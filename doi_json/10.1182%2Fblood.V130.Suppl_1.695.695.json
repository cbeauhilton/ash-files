    "abstract_text": "Background: The \u03b3c-family of cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, IL-21) control major immune responses and lymphocyte development. However, aberrant \u03b3c cytokine activity contributes to or pathologically drives human diseases including T-cell malignancies, graft-versus-host disease, and numerous autoimmune diseases (e.g., alopecia areata), where IL-2, IL-9, and IL-15 have been specifically implicated. Importantly, these multi-cytokine diseases are not effectively and safely treated by the currently available anti-cytokine approaches. Methods: BNZ-1 is the first of a novel class of rationally-designed, multi-cytokine inhibitors that selectively inhibits IL-2 and IL-15, and to a lesser degree, IL-9 signaling through the \u03b3c receptor, without affecting IL-4, IL-7, or IL-21. Preclinical proof-of-concept has been demonstrated in several animal models of T-cell malignancies (Nata et al., 2015 J Biol Chem), including Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia (LGL) and Adult T-cell Leukemia. In this open-label, single-dose, dose-escalation, first-in-human study conducted at a single center in the United States (NCT03046459), 18 healthy adults (n=3/cohort) received a single intravenous dose of 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2 or 6.4 mg/kg infused over \u22645 minutes on Day 1 and were followed for safety and sample collection for 30 days. Results : All subjects completed the study. BNZ-1 was considered well-tolerated with a good safety profile with no serious or severe adverse events (AEs), no dose-limiting toxicities, and no clinically-significant changes on clinical labs (serum biochemistry, hematology, liver enzymes), vital signs or electrocardiograms. Headache was the only AE reported in \u22651 subject (n=3). BNZ-1 exposure was generally dose proportional with an elimination half-life of ~5 days across the range of doses tested, which is consistent with other PEGylated peptides and supports weekly or every other week dosing. The pharmacodynamic activity of BNZ-1 was characterized by flow cytometry of PBMCs obtained on Days 4, 15 and 31 and used to calculate the maximum change from baseline (Emax) for regulatory T-cells (Tregs; IL-2 effect), NK cells (IL-15 effect) and CD8 + central memory T-cells (T cm ; IL-2 & IL-15 effect). For Tregs, a ~50-60% decrease was observed on Day 4 after doses of 0.4 to 1.6mg/kg, while doses of 3.2 and 6.4mg/kg produced an 80-93% decrease from baseline that peaked on Day 15. NK cells were decreased from baseline on Day 4 by 20%, 40% and 60% at 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8mg/kg, respectively, and plateaued at 70 to 80% decrease at doses \u22651.6 mg/kg. T cm were decreased at Day 4 for the three highest dose cohorts that continued to decline to Day 15 when all doses, except 0.2 mg/kg, showed a mean decrease ranging from 10 to 81% that generally trended with dose. Tregs, NK cells, and T cm returned to/toward baseline by 30 days post dose. Post-dose counts of CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells, B-cells, and monocytes were unchanged at all time points studied. Conclusions : These preliminary clinical data suggest that BNZ-1 is a highly-active, selective immunomodulator that safely decreases Tregs, NK cells and T cm , while leaving the major leukocyte populations unaffected. These data support the planned Phase 1/2 dose-ranging study in LGL and Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma. Disclosures Frohna: Bioniz Therapeutics: Employment. Tagaya: Bioniz Therapeutics: Equity Ownership.
