    "abstract_text": "Background Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) currently represent the main therapy for chronic myeloblastic leukemia (CML). Although they are therapeutically effective, some TKI-related events such as pleural effusion and elevation of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) have been reported. In addition, these events itself may affect the therapeutic response to TKIs. In the present study, we measured the levels of some cytokines, chemokines, soluble factors and coagulation markers in patients with CML, and investigated the relationship between these markers and TKI-related events. Methods The subjects were 48 patients with CML. Blood samples were collected and levels of cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, high-mobility group box 1), chemokines (monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, RANTES), soluble molecules (soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, soluble E-selectin, angiopoietin-2, vascular endothelial growth factor, and soluble thrombomodulin) and coagulation markers (plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, platelet-derived microparticles (PDMP)) were measured by ELISA. Results Levels of all markers except IL-6 and MCP-1 were significantly increased in patients with de novo CML. Level of LGL/lymphocyte was significantly higher in dasatinib-treated CML patients compared to other TKI-treated patients. LGL/lymphocyte and many biomarkers exhibit the time-dependent increase after dasatinib treatment. In addition, LGL/lymphocyte was already increasing in patients with pleural effusion before dasatinib treatment. Conclusion These results suggest that LGL and endothelial-cell-related factors play an important role in the pathophysiology of CML and its response to TKIs.
