    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-24 Erythroid precursors in the bone marrow require transferrin-bound iron for hemoglobin synthesis. Therefore, it is not surprising that the regulation of erythropoiesis and iron metabolism is interlinked. Iron demand for erythropoiesis is communicated to the iron-regulatory machinery through incompletely understood mechanisms. At the core of systemic iron homeostasis is the peptide hormone hepcidin, restricting cellular iron export to plasma by inducing the endocytosis and proteolysis of ferroportin. Hepcidin, a liver-synthesized peptide hormone, is released in response to increased iron load, and there is early evidence that circulating hepcidin concentrations affect the distribution of iron between the macrophage storage compartment (favored by higher hepcidin concentrations) and parenchymal cells, including cardiac myocytes and hepatocytes (favored by low hepcidin). Furthermore, ferroportin has recently been identified on erythroid precursors. Its purpose in this cell type and its function in the interface between erythropoiesis and iron metabolism are unclear. Additionally, in response to bleeding or the administration of erythropoietin, expansion of erythroid precursors suppresses hepcidin, most likely through one or more mediators released by the bone marrow and acting on hepatocytes. Iron-loading anemias with ineffective erythropoiesis, in particular \u03b2-thalassemia, demonstrate the effects of pathological \u201cerythroid regulators\u201d of hepcidin. Although erythrocyte transfusions are the main cause of iron loading in patients who receive them (\u03b2-thalassemia major), lethal iron overload is seen also in patients who are rarely or never transfused (\u03b2-thalassemia intermedia). Here, iron hyperabsorption is the cause of iron overload and, as in hereditary hemochromatosis, is caused by low hepcidin. Decreased hepcidin expression in \u03b2-thalassemia, with concurrent ineffective erythropoiesis and iron overload, indicates that the \u201cerythroid regulator\u201d may play an even more substantial role in iron metabolism than the \u201cstores regulator.\u201d Two members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, growth differentiation factor (GDF) 15 and Twisted Gastrulation (TWSG1), have been implicated as candidate bone marrow-derived hepcidin suppressors in \u03b2-thalassemia. Neither factor is responsible for the physiologic hepcidin suppression in response to hemorrhage-induced stress erythropoiesis, and the physiologic suppressor is not known. We focus here on the current state of knowledge regarding the regulation of iron metabolism and attempt to elucidate the interface between iron regulation and erythropoiesis using evidence in part derived from animal models of \u03b2-thalassemia. A more complete understanding of the coregulation of erythropoiesis and iron metabolism may lay the foundation for improving diagnosis, increasing treatment options, and ultimately impacting the well-being of patients afflicted with different anemias and/or iron overload related-disorders.
