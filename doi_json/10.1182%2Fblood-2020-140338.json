    "abstract_text": "Introduction: In 2017, a two-dose recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) containing glycoprotein E (gE) and a novel adjuvant was approved to prevent herpes zoster and its complications in adults \u226550 years of age in the US. There are limited data on the immunogenicity and safety of RZV in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Methods: Between 8/15/2018 and 11/4/2019, RZV-na\u00efve patients with CLL and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) seen at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN were enrolled in this IRB-approved study. All participants received two doses of vaccine, at 0 and 2 months after enrollment. Cell-mediated immunity was measured by dual-color interferon \u03b3 (IFN- \u03b3) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) FLUOROSpot in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after depletion of \u226550% leukemic B cells. Results were reported in spot forming cells (SFC)/10 6 PBMC in wells stimulated with gE overlapping peptides or varicella zoster virus (VZV) inactivated cell lysate. Response rate was defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a \u22652-fold increase in IFN- \u03b3 or IL-2 SFC/10 6 PBMC one month after the second dose of vaccine compared with pre-vaccination baseline levels. We also determined the geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) and geometric mean count (GMC) of SFC /10 6 PBMC at baseline and 90 days after the first dose of vaccine. Two cohorts were enrolled: Cohort 1 consisted of individuals with previously untreated MBL and CLL; and Cohort 2 consisted of CLL participants who were on Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) therapy. We compared the response data to historic age-and sex-matched healthy controls who received RZV. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests measured differences in response rates and Kruskall-Wallis tested for differences in continuous variables. Among CLL participants, multivariable regression analysis was used to investigate the association between day 90 SFC and prior BTKi treatment, accounting for age at RZV, age at CLL diagnosis, sex, and day 0 SFC. Results: Sixty-one participants were enrolled. Paired samples were available for 41 participants (22 in Cohort 1 and 19 [18 ibrutinib and 1 acalabrutinib] in Cohort 2), and 68 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Baseline characteristics of MBL/CLL participants are shown in Table 1 . Compared to healthy controls, participants with MBL/CLL had a significantly lower IFN-\u03b3 VZV-specific response rate (41% vs. 63%, p=0.03) and IFN-\u03b3 gE-specific response (56% vs. 96%, p<0.001); although there were no differences in IL-2 response rates to VZV (51% vs 68%, p=0.09) or gE (95% vs. 100%, p=0.14, Table 2 ). There were differences in GMFR between participants with MBL/CLL and controls that reached statistical significance for IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 gE-specific responses and borderline significance for IFN-\u03b3 VZV-specific responses ( Table 2 ). VZV-specific response rates did not significantly differ between individuals with untreated MBL/CLL and those receiving BTKi (52% vs. 28%, p=0.12 for IFN- \u03b3; (62% vs. 39%, p=0.15 for IL-2), nor did IL-2 gE-specific responses (96% vs. 95%, p=1.0). However, untreated MBL/CLL participants had significantly higher IFN- \u03b3 gE-specific response rate compared to BTKi-treated individuals (73% vs. 37%, p=0.02, Table 2 ). IFN- \u03b3 and IL-2 VZV- and gE-specific SFC GMC was significantly higher at Day 90 compared to Day 0 in all vaccinees, although the magnitude of response was significantly lower in MBL/CLL participants compared to healthy controls ( Table 3 ). Among participants with MBL/CLL, age at diagnosis, age at receipt of RZV, and sex did not predict response to vaccination after accounting for prevaccination values. No serious adverse events were noted among MBL/CLL participants while on this study. Additional analyses including determination of humoral immunogenicity and long-term follow up to ascertain risk of herpes zoster infection are ongoing at this time. Conclusion: RZV was associated with lower cell mediated immunogenicity in MBL/CLL participants compared to healthy older adults. Among individuals with CLL, BTKi treatment was associated with decreased cell mediated immunogenicity of the vaccine. Given the inferior response rates, an additional dose of RZV may be considered to boost responses and should be studied in this patient population.
