    "abstract_text": "Renal impairment (RI) of varying severity including end stage renal disease is a common manifestation of multiple myeloma (MM). Nevertheless, the influence of milder - and via creatinine (crea) determination invisible - RI as a risk factor in MM patients (pts) is less well defined. We have previously reported in 167 cancer pts that estimating the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as compared to serum crea- or cystatin-levels determines prognostically adverse risk groups ( Ann Oncol  18 : 950 \u20138, 2007 ). In order to analyze the frequency of RI stages in a homogenous pt group, we determined RI in 198 consecutive MM pts receiving standard (Std; n=103) or high-dose chemotherapy (hd-CTx; n=95) in a multi-center study. We analyzed disease-stage, sex, age, performance status, \u03b22-microglobulin, serum crea and GFR calculated by both the four-component \u201cModification of Diet in Renal Disease\u201d (MDRD) and Cockcroft-Gault (CG). Evaluated outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). Of note, although median crea, MDRD- and CG-eGFR-values appeared almost normal with 0.9mg/dl, 87 and 82ml/min/1.73m2, respectively, RI as determined as advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD stage >3 = eGFR60 with estimated median values of 15 vs. 20 months and 36 vs. 61.3 months, respectively (p60. In conclusion, we highlight the importance of efficiently detecting RI by means of eGFR-assessment, which allows to detect MM pts with mild - and/or via crea determination invisible - RI. Our data demonstrate that eGFR-decline substantially diminishes PFS and OS in consecutive MM pts, and suggest that with RI, Std- as opposed to hd-therapies do not substantially improve PFS/OS, so that novel therapy approaches are especially needed for those pts with RI, not receiving hd-CTx. These findings should also hold true for other cancer pts.",
