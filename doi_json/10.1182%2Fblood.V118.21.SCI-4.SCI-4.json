    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-4 Efficacious cancer immunotherapies will likely require combinations of strategies that enhance tumor antigen presentation and antagonize negative immune regulatory circuits. We demonstrated that vaccination with irradiated, autologous melanoma cells engineered to secrete granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) followed by antibody blockade of CTLA-4 accomplishes clinically significant tumor destruction with minimal toxicity in some advanced cancer patients. The detailed analysis of patients achieving sustained clinical benefits from these therapies illustrated the importance of a coordinated cellular and humoral anti-tumor immune response. Indeed, the extent of tumor necrosis in posttreatment biopsies was linearly related to the natural logarithm of the ratio of infiltrating CD8+ effector T cells to FoxP3+ Tregs. Moreover, therapy induced a potent antibody response to several key tumor cell surface and secreted proteins; these antibodies manifest functional activity in vitro , antagonizing tumor cell survival, invasive potential, and angiogenesis. Through an analysis of cytokine deficient mice, we delineated a critical role for GM-CSF in Treg homeostasis. GM-CSF is required for the expression of the phosphatidylserine-binding protein MFG-E8 in antigen-presenting cells, whereas the uptake of apoptotic cells by phagocyte-derived MFG-E8 maintains peripheral Treg activity. While blockade of MFG-E8 can enhance therapeutic immunity in the context of cancer vaccines, loss of Treg homeostasis with MFG-E8 deficiency can lead to chronic inflammation. Mice deficient in GM-CSF and IFN-g develop at high frequency germinal center derived lymphomas and non-small cell lung carcinomas. The pathogenesis of these tumors reflects a combination of tumor-promoting inflammation and a loss of protective tumor immunity. Taken together, these findings highlight dual roles for immunity in cancer pathogenesis and therapy. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
