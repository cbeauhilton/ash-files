    "abstract_text": "Background: Transfusion of red blood cells (RBC) into patients with anti-donor RBC antibodies (crossmatch incompatible transfusion) can result in antibody mediated hemolysis. Less well appreciated is the ability of anti-RBC antibodies to specifically remove their target antigen from donor RBCs without compromising cell survival. This phenomenon has now been reported for the major clinically significant blood group antigens, including Rh, Kell, Kidd and Duffy. Although this has been described multiple times in humans, no mechanistic elucidation has been accomplished. In an effort to investigate the mechanism of this process, we describe the first animal model of non-hemolytic antibody induced RBC antigen loss. Methods: mHEL mice express the model antigen Hen Egg Lysozyme (HEL) as a cell surface protein on RBC. Since mHEL mice are on a C57BL/6 background, the mHEL antigen represents a single antigenic difference between donor RBC and recipient mice. Immunizing C57BL/6 mice with HEL/CFA results in the generation of high titer IgG anti-HEL responses rendering the mice crossmatch incompatible with mHEL RBC. This system was utilized to study the effects of transfusing mHEL RBC into crossmatch incompatible recipients. Results: Similar to the antibody induced antigen loss observed in humans, transfusion of donor mHEL RBC into crossmatch incompatible mice results in selective loss of HEL antigen from donor RBC without affecting other blood group antigens or reducing the circulatory lifespan of the donor RBC. In addition, recovered RBC that have lost their antigen have normal morphology. This process is antigen specific and occurs in mice that have received passive injections of anti-HEL antisera. A spleen is not required for antigen loss to occur. However, antigen loss does not occur in animals with a targeted deletion of the Fc\u03b3III receptor. Although polyclonal anti-HEL antisera consistently causes antigen loss, and IgG1 and IgG2b are the predominant subclasses of anti-HEL IgG in the antisera, no antigen loss is observed in response to purified monoclonal anti-HEL antibodies of the IgG1 and IgG2b subclass. Conclusion: These studies demonstrate that antibody induced antigen loss is a process that involves interaction of RBC, anti-RBC IgG and Fc\u03b3III receptors, thus providing mechanistic insight into the phenomenon of antigen loss during incompatible transfusion. The lack of antigen loss in response to monoclonal anti-HEL IgG1 or IgG2b suggests that antigen loss occurs in response to a minor IgG subtype in antisera, depends upon biological properties of the antibody (such as affinity), or that additional serum cofactors are involved.",
