    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2224 Introduction OBI-1 is an investigational B-domain deleted recombinant porcine factor VIII (FVIII) with low cross-reactivity to anti-human FVIII antibodies. Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is caused by autoantibodies (inhibitors) against human FVIII. Patients are predominantly elderly and have co-morbidities. Current pharmacologic treatment of bleeds is guided by clinical assessment alone as there is no laboratory surrogate for efficacy. Importantly, OBI-1 efficacy can be monitored by FVIII levels in addition to clinical assessment. Methods Accur8 Auto-antibody trial ( NCT01178294 ) is a prospective, open label, Phase 2/3 study. The primary objective is to evaluate efficacy of OBI-1 treatment for serious (life- or limb-threatening) bleeds in patients \u226518 years with AHA. FVIII levels are obtained before and within 10\u201320 min following initial OBI-1 dose (200U/kg) and at 2\u20133 h. Additional OBI-1 doses (\u2264400U/kg every 2\u20133 h) are administered to achieve target FVIII levels. The primary efficacy outcome is the control of bleeding 24 h after starting OBI-1. Results As of July, 2012, fifteen patients with severe bleeds were entered into the trial along with one individual treated under compassionate use and all had successful control of hemorrhage at 24 h and subsequent resolution of the bleed. Therapeutic FVIII activity levels were achieved and maintained with intermittent OBI-1 administration based on FVIII levels. Six serious adverse events were reported including four deaths after treatment was discontinued, all being unrelated to OBI-1 as determined by the investigators. Antibodies to OBI-1 developed in two subjects indicated with an * in the table below. However, both responded toOBI-1.  Sex (Age) . Primary bleed site . Anti-human FVIII titer-pre-dose (BU) .
