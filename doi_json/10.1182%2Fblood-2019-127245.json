    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease that develops within a complex microenvironment. Reciprocal interactions between the bone marrow mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BM-MSCs) and AML cells can promote AML progression and resistance to chemotherapy (Jacamo et al., 2014). We have recently reported that BM-MSCs derived from AML patients (n=103) highly express p53 and p21 compared to their normal counterparts (n=73 p<0.0001) (Hematologica, 2018). To assess the function of p53 in BM-MSCs, we generated traceable lineage specific mouse models targeting Mdm2 or Trp53 alleles in MSCs ( Osx-Cre;mTmG;p53 fl/fl and Osx-Cre;mTmG;Mdm2 fl/+ ) or hematopoietic cells ( Vav-Cre;mTmG;p53 fl/fl and Vav-Cre;mTmG;Mdm2 fl/+ ). Homozygote deletion of Mdm2 ( Osx-Cre;Mdm2 fl/fl ) resulted in death at birth and displayed skeletal defects as well as lack of intramedullary hematopoiesis. Heterozygote deletion of Mdm2 in MSCs was dispensable for normal hematopoiesis in adult mice, however, resulted in bone marrow failure and thrombocytopenia after irradiation. Homozygote deletion of Mdm2 in hematopoietic cells ( Vav-Cre;Mdm2 fl/fl ) was embryonically lethal but the heterozygotes were radiosensitive. We next sought to examine if p53 levels in BM-MSCs change after cellular stress imposed by AML. We generated a traceable syngeneic AML model using AML-ETO leukemia cells transplanted into Osx-Cre;mTmG mice. We found that p53 was highly induced in BM-MSCs of AML mice, further confirming our findings in primary patient samples. The population of BM-MSCs was significantly increased in bone marrow Osx-Cre;mTmG transplanted with syngeneic AML cells. Tunnel staining of bone marrow samples in this traceable syngeneic AML model showed a block in apoptosis of BM-MSCs suggesting that the expansion of BM-MSCs in AML is partly due to inhibition of apoptosis. As the leukemia progressed the number of Td-Tomato positive cells which represents hematopoietic lineage and endothelial cells were significantly decreased indicating failure of normal hematopoiesis induced by leukemia. SA-\u03b2-gal activity was significantly induced in osteoblasts derived from leukemia mice in comparison to normal mice further supporting our observation in human leukemia samples that AML induces senescence of BM-MSCs. To examine the effect of p53 on the senescence associated secretory profile (SASP) of BM-MSCs, we measured fifteen SASP cytokines by qPCR and found significant decrease in Ccl4 , Cxcl12 , S100a8 , Il6 and Il1b upon p53 deletion in BM-MSCs (O sx-Cre;mTmG;p53 fl/fl ) compared to p53 wildtype mice. To functionally evaluate the effects of p53 in BM-MSCs on AML, we deleted p53 in BM-MSCs ( Osx-Cre;mTmG;p53 fl/fl ) and transplanted them with syngeneic AML-ETO-Turquoise AML cells. Deletion of p53 in BM-MSCs strongly inhibited the expansion of BM-MSCs in AML and resulted in osteoblast differentiation. This suggests that expansion of BM-MSCs in AML is dependent on p53 and that deletion of p53 results in osteoblast differentiation of BM-MSCs. Importantly, deletion of p53 in BM-MSCs significantly increased the survival of AML mice. We further evaluated the effect of a Mdm2 inhibitor, DS-5272, on BM-MSCs in our traceable mouse models. DS-5272 treatment of Osx-cre ; Mdm2 fl/+ mice resulted in complete loss of normal hematopoietic cells indicating a non-cell autonomous regulation of apoptosis of hematopoietic cells mediated by p53 in BM-MSCs. Loss of p53 in BM-MSCs ( Osx-Cre;p53 fl/fl ) completely rescued hematopoietic failure following Mdm2 inhibitor treatment. In conclusion, we identified p53 activation as a novel mechanism by which BM-MSCs regulate proliferation and apoptosis of hematopoietic cells. This knowledge highlights a new mechanism of hematopoietic failure after AML therapy and informs new therapeutic strategies to eliminate AML.
