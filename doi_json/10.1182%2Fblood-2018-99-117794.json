Djumhana Atmakusuma , MD, PhD 3, 4 1 Department of Internal Medicine, 2 Faculty of Medicine Yarsi University Jakarta, Indonesia, 3 Medical Hematology - Oncology Division of Internal Medicine Department Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, 4 Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia Correspondence: faizaldrissahsb@gmail.com phone +6281533197733 The prevalence of thalassemia in Indonesia is one of the highest in the world. It is estimated that the prevalence of beta thalassemia carrier is around 3-10%. In 2016, thalassemia center in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital (RSCM) Jakarta recorded 9031 patients suffering from major thalassemia in Indonesia. 441 are adult thalassemia patients (age 18 and above) recorded in Kiara thalassemia and hematology-oncology clinics in RSCM. Based on a survey from TIF, endocrine aspect of the thalassemia patients is often ignored by the clinicians. Growth retarded patients are commonly found in the thalassemia clinic in RSCM. Publication regarding the pancreas and its correlation with iron overload in adult beta TDT patients is currently not available in Indonesia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe iron overload condition based on the pancreatic MRI T2* and its correlation with beta TDT adult patients who suffer from growth retardation. A cross sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of endocrine disorders in adult TDT beta patients, followed by looking for correlation of excess iron load with endocrine function in adult TDT beta patients with growth retardation in adult Thalassemia clinic RSCM Jakarta on December 2017. Patients with HBsAg or Anti HCV positive were excluded. Excess iron is defined as Transferin Saturation (ST) greater than 50% regardless of serum ferritin or serum ferritin (FS) levels greater than 1000 ng/mL regardless of ST or both.The growth retardation is defined as the standing height of the research subject which is lower than the Mid Parental Height (MPH) value of both parents. Pancreatic MRI T2* used magneto avanto Siemens 1,5T with CMR software. We found from 58 patients who followed the study, 32 patients underwent the pancreatic MRI T2* examination with 13 female (40,6%) and 19 male (59,4%). Patients with homozygous beta thalassemia are 16 people (50%) and beta/HbE thalassemia 16 people (50%). The Proportion of low pancreatic MRI T2* values was found to be 87.5%, with moderate hemosiderosis in 13 patients (40.63%) and severe hemosiderosis not found (Table 2). The age range of the study subjects was relatively young with a median age of 21 years. Although the median body weight of study subjects was 42 kg, the median BMI still included in normal range. Excess iron content in this study was assessed with serum ferritin, obtained median 4982.5 ng/mL and transferin saturation with a median of 100%, indicates the subject of research are in a state of excess iron load. This is due to the possibility of inflammation, inadequate use of chelation, hemolysis in thalassemia, hypertransfusion to achieve the target of 12 g/dL for women and 13 g/dL for men. There was no significant correlation between serum ferritin and pancreatic MRI T2* value, nor did a significant correlation between transferrin saturation with pancreatic MRI T2* value (Table 3). In this study, there was a high proportion of subjects with low pancreatic MRI T2* value of 28 subjects (87,5%), divided into 15 mild hemosiderosis (46,87%), 13 moderate hemosiderosis (40,62%) and none of severe hemosiderosis. Our study is the first study which look for the correlation of the excess iron load (serum ferritin and transferrin saturation) with endocrine function in adult TDT beta patients with retardation of growth in Indonesia. This research has limitations. First, it was a cross sectional study so it is not known exactly the beginning of endocrine disorders in the subject . The second limitation, analysis of iron chelation therapy did not do in this study. Finally, we concluded that there was no correlation between pancreatic MRI T2* and iron overload based on serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. Further longitudinal studies in adult TDT patients with thalassemia who have not and have retarded growth were needed.
