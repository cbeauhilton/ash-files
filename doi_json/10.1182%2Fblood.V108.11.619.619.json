    "abstract_text": "Infections with cytomegalovirus are still a major clinical problem in immunosuppressed patients e.g. after bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. To prevent clinical overt disease resulting from disseminated virus infection, immunoprophylaxis and/or -therapy are considered a major goal. The humoral immune response contributes to immune protection against CMV by providing neutralizing antibodies. However, in the early phase after transplantation a primary immune response is not possible. Humoral anti-CMV immune effector functions can only be provided by memory B cells. The activation requirements for resting memory B cells are unclear. Using non-infectious hCMV particles in mice we have recently shown that activation of virus-specific memory B cells to secrete IgG is independent of cognate or bystander T cell help. To analyze whether transfer of memory B cells into immunodeficient mice can protect from lethal infection we switched to an infectious animal model using mCMV. When memory B cells from mCMV-infected mice were adoptively transferred into RAG-1\u2212/\u2212 mice, a strong IgG anti-mCMV titer developed within 4\u20136 days after infection with mCMV. Virus dissemination and subsequent disease was inhibited. A 100\u20131000 fold decrease of virus titers and a 1.000\u201310.000 fold decrease of viral DNA load in spleen and lung was observed in mice that received mCMV specific memory B cells. Even in an established mCMV infection virus dissemination and subsequent disease could be prevented by means of adoptive memory B cell transfer. In further experiments we also used a virus mutant that cannot be controlled by NK cells in C57Bl/6 mice. Even in this experimental system we could demonstrate that adoptive transfer of memory B cells in the absence CD4 and CD8 cells is sufficient to protect from viral dissemination and rapid lethality. Our results show that memory B cells can mediate protection against mCMV in the absence of cognate or bystander T cell help. Similar regimens might be a therapeutic option for CMV reactivation after bone marrow transplantation in patients.",
