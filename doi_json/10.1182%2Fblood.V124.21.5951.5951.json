    "abstract_text": "Background: The most severe form of \u03b2-thalassemia, \u03b2\u00b0-thalassemia major, is characterized by the complete absence of normal \u03b2-globin chain, and is often lethal. Autologous transplantation of genetically-modified hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) using lentiviral vectors have been used successfully to achieve clinical efficacy in one patient, although clonal expansion of a myeloid cell population also occurred in this patient which was associated with the activation of a cellular proto-oncogene, HMGA2. We reasoned that recombinant vectors based on a non-pathogenic human parvovirus, the adeno-associated virus (AAV), might offer a safer alternative. We have previously documented that although the conventional single-stranded (ss) AAV2 vectors mediated \u03b2-globin gene transfer and expression in primary human fetal liver cells and in human HSCs from patients with \u03b2-thalassemia patients in vitro , the level of transgene expression was sub-optimal. In the present study, we investigated whether double-stranded self-complementary (sc) AAV2 vectors could overcome this limitation. Methods: Human HSCs, obtained from a \u03b2-thalassemia homozygous patient, were mock-transduced or transduced with recombinant scAAV2-\u03b2-globin vectors at 5\u00d710 4 vgs/cell, followed by i.v. injection into sub-lethally irradiated NOD/SCID mice (2.65 cGy total body irradiation), which were also pre-treated with 200 \u00b5g purified anti-IL2RB/CD122 monoclonal antibody. Recipient mice were sacrificed 12 weeks post-transplantation. Bone marrow cells from recipient mice were analyzed by BFU-E assays. Human \u03b2-globin gene expression in human erythroid progenitor cells from transplanted mice was evaluated by RT-PCR. Results: Pre-treatment of NOD/SCID mice with anti-CD122 antibody improves engraftment of human HSCs in bone marrow of receipt mice. Human \u03b2-actin (538-bp) and \u03b2-globin (272-bp) transcripts were detected by RT-PCR in bone marrow cells from all recipient mice, indicating that recombinant scAAV2-\u03b2-globin\u2013transduced HSCs from a patient with \u03b2-thalassemia were successfully transduced and transplanted in these mice and that human \u03b2-globin gene was transcriptionally active 12 weeks post-transplantation. Conclusion: Our results indicate that human HSCs from \u03b2-thalassemia patients can be efficiently transduced by recombinant scAAV2-\u03b2-globin vectors followed by expression of normal human \u03b2-globin gene. These studies provide the proof-of-concept that scAAV2 vector-mediated gene transfer into human HSCs might be a potentially safer alternative approach for gene therapy of \u03b2-thalassemia.
