    "abstract_text": "Abstract 708 Nuclear Factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) is a key mediator of the inflammatory response and also inhibits apoptosis. Activation of NF-\u03baB is prevalent in AML, Hodgkin's lymphoma and subsets of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as in multiple solid tumors. NF-\u03baB p50 (NF-\u03baB1) and p65 (Rel A) are the most prevalent NF-\u03baB subunits. NF-\u03baB p65 has 30\u201350 fold higher affinity than p50 for the cytoplasmic protein I\u03baB, and so under basal conditions p50:p65 heterodimers are held in the cytoplasm whereas p50:p50 homodimers are found in the nucleus bound to chromatin where they repress NF-\u03baB target genes via association with HDACs. Canonical NF-\u03baB activation signals lead to I\u03baB proteosome-mediated degradation and translocation of p50:p65 heterodimers into the nucleus to replace inhibitory p50:p50 dimers with activating complexes on chromatin. We postulate an alternative means to activate NF-\u03baB target genes wherein induction or activation of C/EBP proteins allows them to bind chromatin-bound p50 and displace HDACs in cells lacking canonical NF-\u03baB activation. We found that C/EBP\u03b1 induces bcl-2 and FLIP RNA expression via promoter interaction dependent upon the presence of NF-\u03baB p50, that C/EBP\u03b1 present in two myeloid leukemia cell lines preferentially binds p50 compared with p65, and that mutation of the C/EBP\u03b1 basic region prevents bcl-2 induction and weakens interaction with p50 but not p65 (Paz-Priel et al 2005; 2009; Wang et al 2009). Using p50 and p65 variants containing the FLAG epitope at either their N- or C-termini we now demonstrate using reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation that p50 has much higher affinity than p65 for C/EBP\u03b1, for N-terminal or leucine zipper mutants of C/EBP\u03b1 expressed in a subset of AML cases, and for the longer LAP or shorter LIP isoforms of C/EBP\u03b2. The FLAG-tagged p65 proteins retained the ability to bind DNA in a gel shift assay and to activate a reporter containing two \u03baB sites as effectively as untagged p65. Deletion of the p65 trans-activation domain (TAD) did not increase p65 affinity for C/EBP\u03b1, indicating that an inhibitory effect of the TAD does not account for specificity of C/EBP\u03b1:p50 interaction. Moreover, the increased affinity of the p50 rel homolog domain (RHD) for C/EBP\u03b1 compared with the p65 RHD suggests that residues that differ between these RHDs rather than those in common make key contacts wih the C/EBP basic region. Germline deletion of the gene encoding p65, by injecting p65(flox/flox); Mx1-CRE mice with pIpC, did not reduce C/EBP\u03b1 expression, prevent interaction of C/EBP\u03b1 with the bcl-2 promoter in a ChIP assay, or reduce bcl-2 RNA expression, in contrast to our prior findings with p50 gene deletion. A C/EBP\u03b1 variant harboring a single point mutation in the basic region, C/EBP\u03b1(R300A), has minimal affinity for p50, and further saturating mutagenesis of the C/EBP\u03b1 basic region identifies an additional block of six amino acids, RERNNI, identical in C/EBP\u03b2 and critical for interaction with NF-\u03baB p50. In conclusion, increased affinity of C/EBP proteins for p50 compared with p65 lends support to the hypothesis that C/EBP interaction with p50:p50 complexes provides an alternative means for normal cells or cancer cells to activate NF-\u03baB target genes, for example in response to C/EBP induction or activation. C/EBP interaction with p50:p65 in activated cells may also occur, via p50, to further activate genes regulated by NF-\u03baB. In addition, these findings suggest that targeting the C/EBP:p50 interface rather than C/EBP:p65 interaction will prove more effective in the therapy of inflammatory or malignant conditions, and our mapping of relevant basic region residues and the finding that the p50 RHD retains increased affinity for C/EBP\u03b1 compared wih the p65 RHD provides a first step towards rational design of such inhibitors.
