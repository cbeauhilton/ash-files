    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3600 Poster Board III-537 The mobilization of blood monocytes and their differentiation into macrophages during the immune-inflammatory response helps to prepare the tissue for resolution. During the resolution phase of inflammation macrophages do not die locally: some cells emigrate by draining lymphatics whereas some remain at the site of inflammation. The major myelo-monocytic integrin \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 (Mac-1, CD11b/CD18), together with two related integrins \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 (CD11d/CD18) and \u03b1 X \u03b2 2 (CD11c/CD18), mediate critical adhesive reactions of monocyte/macrophages. However, the roles of these adhesion receptors in control of macrophage retention at sites of inflammation and their emigration to lymph nodes are unclear. Using a mouse model of sterile peritonitis induced by thioglycollate injection, we examined the dynamics of macrophage \u03b2 2 integrins during the resolution phase of inflammation. Macrophages were defined by FACS analyses as a population of cells expressing \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 high , \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 + and CD115 + . The initial population of resident \u03b2 2 , positive for \u03b2 D \u03b2 2 and negative for \u03b1 X \u03b2 2 . The thioglycollate-challenged mice showed a \u223c4-fold increase in macrophages on day 3 followed by a progressive decrease to normal resident cell numbers by day 13. Expression of \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 on macrophages on day 3 decreased by 2.5-fold as a result of dilution of the initial population of \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 high resident macrophages by infiltrating blood monocytes expressing \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 low . However, after day 3, the density of \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 on macrophages gradually increased and by day 13 returned to the high levels characteristic of resident macrophages. By contrast, expression of \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 and \u03b1 X \u03b2 2 on inflammatory macrophages increased by 2-fold by day 6-9 compared to that on resident macrophages and then returned to the resident levels by day 3. Thus, although the number of macrophages decreased from day 3 to day 9 by several fold, the population of macrophages which remained in the peritoneum was enriched in cells expressing the high levels of \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 and \u03b1 D \u03b1 2 . Tracking migration of fluorescently labeled peritoneal cells demonstrated that a population of macrophages which leaves the inflamed peritoneum and enters lymph nodes consists of cells expressing low levels of \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 and \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 . These data suggested that upregulation of \u03b2 2 integrins, especially \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 , may be responsible for the retention of macrophages in the peritoneum. Indeed, the rate of macrophage emigration from the peritoneum in the \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 -deficient mice was significantly higher than that in wild-type mice. The results indicate that macrophage emigration from the inflamed site is controlled by the level of integrin \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 and \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 with low expressors being migratory and high expressors remaining in the peritoneum. The data also highlight the importance of integrins \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 and \u03b1 X \u03b2 2 as specific markers of inflammatory macrophages.
