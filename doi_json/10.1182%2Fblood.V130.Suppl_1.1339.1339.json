    "abstract_text": "Background: Decitabine is widely used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in elderly patients. Low-dose ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) has also been indicated to induce DNA demethylation at the cellular level. Our previous study demonstrated its combined effect and safety with low-dose decitabine prior to aclarubicin andcytarabine (DCAG) in elderly patients with AML, in which it appeared to achieve a complete remission (CR) rate of 76.3% and a median overall survival of 10 months. Pharmacological concentrations of Vitamin C (10-1,000\u03bcM) induced a time- and dose-dependent increase in 5-hmC. However, little is known whether low-dose Vitamin C has a synergistic effect with decitabine in clinic. Methods: The effect of combined low-dose Vitamin C and decitabine on cell proliferation, the cell cycle, apoptosis and the expression level and activity of TET2 was investigated in HL-60 and NB-4 human leukemic cells. Additionally, we analyzed the clinical outcomes of 73 elderly AML patients who received A-DCAG (intravenous Vitamin C [IVC] plus DCAG [ n =39]) or DCAG ( n =34) treatment. Patients received one of the two induction courses: DCAG or A-DCAG. DCAG consisted of 15mg/m 2 of decitabine (intravenously, days 1-5) and 300 \u03bcg/day of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, days 0-9) for priming its combination with 10 mg/m 2 of cytarabine ( q12h , days 3-9), 8 mg/m 2 of aclarubicin (days 3-6, DCAG), or IVC (50-80 mg/kg/day, days 0-9; A-DCAG). The G-CSF priming was discontinued when white blood count (WBC) was \u226520\u00d710 9 /L. Results: We found that low-dose Vitamin C and decitabine has a synergistic efficacy on proliferation, apoptosis and TET2 activity, compared to drug-alone treatment in HL60 and NB4 cell lines in vitro . In clinic, feasibility and safety evaluations revealed that patients who received A-DCAG regimen have a higher complete remission (CR) rate than those who received the DCAG regimen (79.92 % vs. 44.11%; P =0.004) after one cycle of chemotherapy. IVC admission decision appeared to beat the discretion of attending physicians. The median overall survival (OS) was better in the A-DCAG group compared with the DCAG group (15.3 months vs. 9.3 months, P =0.039). Patients with adverse cytogenetics did benefit from CR. There was no clinically significant additional toxicity observed with the addition of IVC. Conclusion: On the basis of these results, the addition of IVC at low doses to DCAG appeared to improve CR and prolong OS, compared with DCAG, in elderly patients with AML.
