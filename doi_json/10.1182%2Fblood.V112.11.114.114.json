    "abstract_text": "Background: The anti-VEGF drug, bevacizumab (Bev), has been associated with arterial thromboembolism in colorectal cancer patients. However, the mechanism of this remains poorly understood, and preclinical testing in mice failed to predict thrombosis. Prevailing opinion on the molecular mechanism behind Bev-associated bleeding and thrombosis is that tissue factor driven coagulation, secondary to vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, may cause thrombosis due to VEGF suppression by Bev. Bev forms immune complexes (IC) with VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), a heparin-binding protein. In our previous in vitro studies we showed that, in the presence of heparin, Bev+VEGF immune complexes activate platelets via the IgG receptor Fc\u03b3RIIa \u2014a mechanism similar to that observed with antibodies from patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Objectives : First, we investigated whether Bev-associated thrombosis might be replicated in mice. Because mouse platelets do not carry Fc\u03b3RIIa, we used mice transgenic for this human IgG receptor (hFcR mice) in order to enable the signaling pathway identified above. Second, using human platelets in vitro , we studied the functional roles of heparin and platelet surface localization of IC in Bev-induced Fc\u03b3RIIa activation. Methods: Bev+VEGF IC were preformed using VEGF 165 or VEGF 121 (similar to VEGF 165 but lacking the heparin-binding domain). Platelet dense granule release and aggregation were measured by the serotonin release assay (SRA) and Chrono- Log aggregometers, respectively. Platelet surface localization was assessed by flow cytometry (50,000 events/test condition) and fluorescence microscopy using Alexa488- labeled Bev (Bev 488 ). For in vivo studies, Bev+VEGF+Heparin IC (60\u2013500 nM) or control reagents were injected intravenously into wild-type (WT) or hFcR mice. Platelet counts were measured 10\u201360 minutes following IC injection after obtaining blood (0.45 ml) by cardiac puncture. Immediately afterward, lungs were processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining and analyzed microscopically for evidence of thrombosis. Results: IC consisting of Bev+VEGF 165 +Heparin (0.2U/ml) caused thrombotic thrombocytopenia in hFcR but not WT mice, showing a requirement for Fc\u03b3RIIa. Injection of Bev+VEGF 121 +Heparin (0.2U/ml) into hFcR mice did not cause thrombocytopenia, suggesting a requirement for the VEGF 165 heparin binding domain. Bev+VEGF 165 was without effect in the absence of heparin or in the presence of excess (200 U/ml) heparin demonstrating that a limited range of heparin concentrations enable Bev-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. This mechanism is similar to that observed in HIT and our in vivo results were consistent with SRA and aggregation in vitro studies. By flow cytometry, maximal Fab-dependent Bev 488 platelet surface binding occured only with VEGF 165 +0.2U/ml heparin. Saturating IV.3 (anti-Fc\u03b3RIIa antibody) concentrations, present in all samples, excluded Bev-Fc binding to Fc\u03b3RIIa. Furthermore, binding of Bev 488 +VEGF 121 +0.2 U/ml heparin was not detected, suggesting the VEGF heparin binding domain is required for heparin-enhanced surface binding. Conclusions: In the presence of heparin, Bev can induce platelet aggregation, degranulation and thrombosis through complex formation with VEGF and activation of Fc\u03b3RIIa receptor. This mechanism may be relevant to the thromboembolic complications observed in patients receiving Bev therapy."
