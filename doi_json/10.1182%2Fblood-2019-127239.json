    "abstract_text": "Background: Plateletpheresis is the process by which a therapeutic adult dose of platelet concentrate is produced from a single donor using automated cell separator equipment. Recently, the demand for Apheresis Platelets concentrate transfusions has been increasing in our hospitals. This has been attributed to increased cases of malignancy associated bone marrow suppression and various other causes of thrombocytopaenia and thrombopathies. The Increasing use of myeloablative chemotherapy in treatment of haematological and other malignancies also results in transient severe fall in platelet count. The demand generally outstrips the supply necessitating the need to search for additional donor sources to increase the supply of platelets for transfusion. Is it therefore possible to reduce the time interval between plateletpheresis while maintaining donor safety? Aims and Objectives: The aim of the study was to determine the platelets recovery time after platelets concentrate donation with a view to determining the appropriate deferral time for repeat plateletpheresis Methods: The study was conducted at the National Hospital Abuja. Fifty seven healthy plateletpheresis donors were recruited over a period of seven months and their haematological parameters were analyzed on days 0, 2 and 7 post donation. We excluded donors whose pre-donation platelet count were less than 200 x 10 9 /L Results and Analysis: Analysis was done in only forty eight (48) donors as nine (9) participants withdrew before the end of the study. The results show There was a significant decrease in the platelets counts (p <0.001), with subsequent good platelets recovery post donation (Pre: 259.83\u00b144.61 x 10 9 /L; Post - Day 0: 205.29\u00b136.77 x 10 9 /L, day 2: 216.88\u00b132.71 x 10 9 /L and day 7: 240.3\u00b141.83 x 10 9 /L). The apheresis donors recovered 64.29% of the lost platelets by day 2 of donation and subsequently attain 92.49% of pre-donation count within 7 days of donation. There was a statistically significant transient increase in the immediate post donation haemoglobin concentration (14.72\u00b11.32)g/dL but this gradually reduced on day 2 (13.75\u00b11.04)g/dL and 13.83\u00b11.04g/dL on day 7 showing no significant different from the pre-donation Hb of 13.96\u00b11.02g/dL Conclusion: This study has shown statistically significant platelets recovery 7 days after plateletpheresis making a 7 day deferral for repeat plateletpheresis feasible in our environment. The study also shows feasibility of a 2 days deferral as recommended by AABB. Strict monitoring and pre-donation evaluation of donors should be done to prevent any adverse events such as anaemia and thrombocytopenia.
