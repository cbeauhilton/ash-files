    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2136 Introduction: Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is an inherited disorder of abnormal hemoglobin synthesis. Hydroxyurea (HU) is the only disease modifying agent available for use in patients with SCA. Clinically, HU has been shown to decrease pain, number of transfusions, and development of acute chest syndrome as well as improve life expectancy in adults with SCA. Although HU is increasingly utilized to treat children with SCA, drug exposure-response relationships and therapeutic drug monitoring are not well characterized in the pediatric population. The exposure-response relationships of HU are currently being evaluated as is the potential role of therapeutic drug monitoring. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model sufficient to describe HU disposition in serum and urine following oral drug administration in pediatric patients. Such a model is required for exploring concentration-effect relationships in children with SCA taking HU. Methods: PK was determined in 20 subjects (mean age 10.5 yr, range 5\u201317 yr) with SCA either as a single dose (SD, n=6, average dose 17.4 mg/kg) or at steady state (SS, n=14, average daily dose 25.5 mg/kg). Blood and urine samples for HU assay were taken throughout the 24 hour period post HU administration. HU was quantitated by a validated gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Population nonlinear mixed-effect modeling was done using NONMEM software. Measured HU concentrations at specific sampling time points were compared to model predicted area under the curves (AUCs) to find the most predictive relationship. Results: A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and two elimination pathways (metabolic and renal) was used. The mean absorption rate constant differed for children < 8.5 years of age (19.5 h \u22121 ) as compared to those \u2265 8.5 years of age (2.1 h \u22121 ) and demonstrated high intersubject variability (76%). The population apparent volume of distribution ( V/F ) was 21.3 L (for an average weight patient of 30.7 kg) with an intersubject variability of 24.7%. The apparent renal ( CL u /F ) and metabolic ( CL m /F ) clearance was 3.47 L/hr and 3.52 L/hr, respectively, with the same between subject variability of 42%. Significant relationships (p<0.005) between both CL/F and V/F and body weight were found with these parameters increasing by 2.96% and 2.49%, respectively, for every kilogram difference from the median weight. Significant linear correlations were apparent between the plasma HU concentration at 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, and 6 hours post-dose; the most significant (p<0.01, r 2 =0.71) occurring at 1.5 hours. Conclusion: In children with SCA, a population PK model parameterized from a classical PK study of HU was successful in describing HU disposition in plasma and urine. Data from the model also demonstrated that HU plasma concentrations at 1.5 or 2 hours after an oral dose of the drug were especially predictive of systemic drug exposure (as reflected by AUC). Data from this study also suggest that there may be age related differences in absorption rates. Further studies are warranted to confirm this finding.
