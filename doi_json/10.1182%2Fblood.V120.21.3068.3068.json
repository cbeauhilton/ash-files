    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3068 Advanced age is becoming less of a barrier to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and transplantation has become an established standard of care for many older patients (pts) with hematologic malignancies. We previously reported superior quality of life (QOL) scores in pts age 60 and over undergoing high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant compared with pts less than 60 (Dabney J et al, Blood 2008 112: Abstract 2381). These data prompted us to evaluate QOL assessments in pts\u226560 undergoing allogeneic HCT compared to pts<60 years. 435 adult pts underwent allogeneic HCT from June 2003 to December 2010. Prospective psychometric instruments were administered to 304 pts 1 compared to 74% in pts\u226560), preparative regimen, (84% myeloablative in pts <60, 21% in pts \u226560%), and source of hematopoietic cells, (29% peripheral stem cells in pts<60 versus 72% in pts\u226560), with a higher median CD34+ cell dose (4.51\u00d710 6 /kg in pts\u226560) compared with pts<60 (2.51\u00d710 6 /kg). Psychosocial functioning and QOL differences were compared between age groups over time by repeated measures analysis of variance, using intensity of transplant as a variable given the imbalance. On FACT, pts\u226560 reported better social (p=0.006) and functional well being (p=0.05), and had better total FACT scores, (p=0.043) across all time points. On POMS, pts\u226560 reported less fatigue than patients<60 (p=0.01), while COPE assessment indicated that older pts reported worse use of planning (p=0.012) and humor (p=0.041) compared with younger pts. Pts\u226560 years also reported worse scores for active coping, but only at day 365 (p=0.019), and scored worse on behavioral disengagement at the first post-transplant time point (p=0.016), but this difference became non-significant by day 100 (p=0.81). With a median follow up of 49 months, there were no significant differences in OS, RFS, relapse, or chronic GVHD. There was a lower incidence of grade 3\u20134 acute GVHD in pts\u226560 compared to pts<60, (6.4% versus 15.8% at 6 months, p=0.016). This study provides further evidence that advanced age should not be a barrier in the decision to pursue allogeneic HCT. Older pts achieved better total scores in QOL assessments when compared to younger pts. One can hypothesize that older pts are more likely to have experienced adversity or family and personal health related problems, making them better able to endure symptoms than younger pts. In addition, younger pts may be more affected due to non-health related concerns including the adverse effect of transplantation on their careers, family, and finances. While our older population has proven to have similar medical outcomes and improved QOL, younger pts may benefit from social work interventions that focus on adapting to changes in functioning and social well-being.
