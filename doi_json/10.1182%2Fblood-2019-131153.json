    "abstract_text": "The erythroid transcriptome is extensively remodeled during terminal erythropoiesis by dynamic changes in RNA splicing of cassette exons and retained introns. Mechanistic studies of these RNA processing networks will provide new insight into pathways that impact structure and function of the erythroid proteome during erythroblast differentiation. We previously showed that up-regulation of EPB41 exon 16 splicing imparts new functionality to the encoded protein, enhancing protein-protein interactions that mechanically strengthen the red cell membrane. More recently, RNA-seq analysis revealed that numerous erythroid transcripts exhibit up-regulation of intron retention (IR) events, some of which are controlled by a decoy exon-mediated mechanism that can reduce the output of translated mRNA so as to limit protein expression. Here we demonstrate that modulation of decoy-mediated IR quantitatively affects protein expression in primary human erythroid cells. We first studied the OGT gene (O-GlcNAc transferase), a key regulator of O-GlcNAC homeostasis. OGT expression responds to pharmacological inhibitors by regulating intron 4 retention, by a mechanism requiring a intronic splicing silencer (1) that functions as a decoy exon (2) to nonproductively engage annotated splice sites at the ends of the intron, thereby blocking excision and enforcing its retention. In erythroid CD34+ progenitors at day 7 of culture, we found that treatment with an OGT inhibitor (OSMI-1) reduced OGT IR and increased spliced OGT RNA and OGT protein. Conversely, an inhibitor of the antagonistic OGA enzyme (thiamet-G) induced greater OGT IR and reduced OGT protein expression. These results are similar to what was reported previously in established cell lines (1), and suggest that modulation of IR can vary mRNA and protein expression in primary cells >5-fold. To further explore the model, we independently blocked OGT IR in erythroid cultures by electroporation of an antisense morpholino directed against the OGT decoy exon 5' splice site. RT-qPCR and western blot analysis confirmed substantial reduction in IR, coupled with an increase in spliced RNA and elevated OGT protein expression, compared to control cells or cells treated with an irrelevant morpholino. The OGT-specific MO also substantially blocked IR induced by thiamet-G. These results show that pharmacological- or antisense-mediated alteration in IR can significantly change protein expression in primary erythroblast cultures. We propose that the abundance of IR transcripts in late erythropoiesis represents a widespread modulation of protein output by post-transcriptional pathways operating at the level of intron retention.
