    "abstract_text": "Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is the genetic form of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis with an autosomal recessive form of inheritance and early onset. FHL is characterized by prolonged fever, hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia. Type 3 of FHL (FHL3) which accounts for 30-35 % of all FHL patients, results from mutations in UNC13D gene encoding Munc13-4 protein. Munc13-4 controls fusion of lytic granules with the plasma membrane in cytotoxic lymphocytes and its defect leads to impaired cytotoxic activity in T and NK lymphocytes. The only curative method for FHL3 is allogenic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. For those patients without compatible bone marrow donor, gene therapy could represent a therapeutic option. Our study is based on a comparative analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of stem cell and T-cell gene therapy for FHL3. To this end we have generated SIN-lentiviral constructs expressing Munc13-4 and used them to produce either VSVG or T-cell specific pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. We also could obtain functionally mature T-cells in vitro , derived from umbilical cord blood HSCs which respond to TCR stimulation and show cytotoxic effect. Using these approaches, first we demonstrated that our SIN-lentiviral constructs are able to transduce efficiently human T-cells and HSCs. We used then these vectors to complement the FHL3 patient\u2019s cells. Transduction of FHL3 CD8 effector cells restored their cytotoxic function that was comparable to that of control cells. In addition we noted that the overexpression of Munc 13-4 in normal human HSCs didn\u2019t alter in vitro differentiation of these cells towards T-cells. The effect of this overexpression on B-cells and myeloid differentiation is currently under investigation. These preliminary results will be followed by ex vivo gene transfer experiments in Munc13-4 deficient \u201c Jinx \u201d mice to further investigate the functional restoration as well as toxic effects. This strategy, if approved, could offer a safe therapeutic method not only for FHL3 patients but also for other genetic or acquired dysfunctions of T-lymphocytes.
