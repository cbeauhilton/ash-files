    "abstract_text": "The insulin-like growth factor-1receptor (IGF-1R) is overexpressed in a variety of tumors and has been associated with cancer development. Here, we analysis the IGF-IR expression on the bone marrow cells from 45 newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by flow cytometry. IGF-1R universally expressed on AML blasts and the leukemia cell line HL-60, did not show significant correlation with FAB subtypes. However, the bone marrow cells from AML patients with high myeloblast counts (>80%) generally showed brighter IGF-IR expressions, which indicated the IGF-IR pathway might play an important role for AML blast proliferation and survival. Indeed, blocking the IGF-1R pathway by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could reduce the proliferation of HL-60 cells by 38.28% at 48 hr. This inhibitory effect on blast growth was observed in 4 of 5 AML samples. In the same IGF-1R blocking treatment, the apoptosis of HL-60 cells was significantly induced, resulting in apoptosis of 57% of the cell population with the measurement of Annexin V vs PI staining by flow cytometry. The control contained only 20% apoptotic cells. We also demonstrated that the blockade of the IGF-1R pathway inhibited the phophorylation of the PI3K pathway component Akt in HL-60 cells when cultured in a serum free system with a supplement of 50ng/ml exogenous IGF. Since PI3K pathway activation greatly contributes to the proliferation, survival and drug resistance of AML, it is of interest to study whether blockading IGF-IR could also inhibit the PI3K pathway in primary AML blasts and synergize other anti-leukemia agents to improve the therapeutic effectiveness. Conclusions: IGF-IR may play an important role in the proliferation and survival of the AML blast population; Blocking the IGF-IR pathway could significantly inhibit the growth of AML blasts and considerably induce the apoptosis of AML blasts; IGF-IR could become a critical molecular target in anti-leukemia drug discovery."
