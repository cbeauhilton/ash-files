    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4034 Natural Killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system with anti-viral and anti-cancer activity. Over the past decade, they have gained interest as a promising cellular source for use in adoptive immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer. Most notably, NK cells play an important role in the graft-vs-tumor effect seen in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), and a better understanding of NK cell biology has translated into improved transplant outcomes in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Small studies have demonstrated a role for NK cell activity in multiple myeloma (MM) patients receiving allo-HSCT. Investigators have also utilized haplo-identical killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) mismatched NK cells for adoptive immunotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Our group has focused on the development of NK cells from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as a novel starting source of lymphocytes for immunotherapy. We have previously demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity of hESC-derived NK cells in vitro and in vivo against a variety of different targets. We have also shown that iPSC-derived NK cells from a variety of different somatic cell starting sources posses potent anti-tumor and anti-viral activity. Here, we demonstrate hESC- and iPSC-derived NK cell development in a completely defined, feeder-free system that is amenable to clinical scale-up. These cultures contain a pure population of mature NK cells devoid of any T or B cell contamination, which are common adverse bystanders of cellular products isolated and enriched from peripheral blood. Our cultures are homogenous for their expression of CD56 and express high levels of effector molecules known to be important in anti-MM activity, including KIR, CD16, NKG2D, NKp46, NKp44, FasL and TRAIL. We have now tested the activity of hESC- and iPSC-derived NK cells against MM tumor cells in order to provide a universal source of lymphocytes for adoptive immunotherapy in patients with treatment refractory disease. We find that similar to peripheral blood NK cells (PB-NK), hESC- and iPSC-derived NK cells are cytotoxic against 3 distinct MM cell lines in a standard chromium release cytotoxicity assay. Specifically, activated PB-NK cells killed 48.5% of targets at 10 to 1 effector to target ratios, whereas hESC (46.3%) and iPSC (42.4%) derived NK cells also demonstrated significant anti-MM activity. Also, hESC- and iPSC-derived NK cells secrete cytokines (IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1) and degranulate as demonstrated by CD107a surface expression in response to MM target cell stimulation. When tested against freshly isolated samples from MM patients, hESC- and IPSC-derived NK cells respond at a similar level as activated PB-NK cells, the current source of NK cells used in adoptive immunotherapy trials. These MM targets (both cell lines and primary tumor cells) are known to express defined ligands (MICA/B, DR4/5, ULBP-1, BAT3) for receptors expressed on NK cells as well as a number of undefined ligands for natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) and KIR. As these receptor-ligand interactions drive the anti-MM activity of NK cells, we are currently evaluating expression of each of these molecules on the surface of both the effector and target cell populations. Not only do hESC- and iPSC-derived NK cells provide a unique, homogenous cell population to study these interactions, they also provide a genetically tractable source of lymphocytes for improvement of the graft-vs-myeloma effect and could be tailored on a patient specific basis using banks of hESC-or iPSC-derived NK cells with defined KIR genotypes for use as allogeneic or autologous effector cells.
