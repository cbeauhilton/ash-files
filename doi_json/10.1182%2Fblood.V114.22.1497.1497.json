    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1497 Poster Board I-520 KLF4 is a tumor suppressor in the gastrointestinal tract known to induce cell cycle arrest in a cell context dependent manner. We recently reported that KLF4 maintains quiescence of T lymphocytes downstream of T-cell receptor signaling (Yamada et al., Nature Immunology, 2009). The role of KLF4 in reprogramming adult somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells along with Oct3/4, c-Myc and Sox2 suggests that KLF4 restricts proliferation of undifferentiated cells. In spite of a redundant role of KLF4 in fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), its role in the maintenance of adult bone marrow HSCs has not been studied yet. To study the role of KLF4 in the hematopoietic system we used gain- and loss-of-function mouse models. Retroviral transfer of KLF4 into wild type bone marrow (BM) cells led to significant reduction of colony forming units (CFU) in methylcellulose cultures due to increased apoptosis and lower proliferation. Then, Mx1-Cre was used to induce deletion of Klf4-floxed mice by polyI:C administration. Analysis of peripheral blood cells up to 6-9 months post polyI:C administration showed significant reduction of monocytes, as previously reported, and expansion of CD8+CD44+ T cells due to their increased proliferative potential. BM cells from Klf4-deficient mice exhibited increased number of myeloid progenitor cells measured by flow cytometry (Lin-Sca-1-c-kit+FcRII/III+CD34+ cells), CFU and CFU-S8. Cytoablation with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) showed lower nadir of peripheral white blood cells in Klf4-deficient mice compared to control mice. In spite of normal multilineage reconstitution in BM transplants experiments, competitive reconstitution with Klf4-deficient and normal BM cells resulted in reduced contribution of Klf4-deficient cells to peripheral blood, likely due to homing and proliferative differences. Collectively, our data shows that KLF4 has an important role in function of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
