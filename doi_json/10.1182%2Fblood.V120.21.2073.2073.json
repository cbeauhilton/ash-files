    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2073 Background: Risk of bleeding is an important consideration among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), and different anatomical sites may carry greater risk for bleeding. Objective: To describe the incidence of critical anatomical site bleeding events among patients with NVAF in the pre-NOAC (novel oral anticoagulation) era. Methods: Administrative claims data were used for this retrospective study. Adults with healthcare claims related to atrial fibrillation (ICD-9-CM 427.31) between Jan 2005 and Jun 2009 but no evidence of valvular disease were included. Patients were followed until the earliest of death, disenrollment from the health plan, or 30 Jun 2010. Bleeding events in the follow-up period were considered major if they were associated with any of the following: inpatient care, blood transfusion, decreased hemoglobin or hematocrit, physician guided medical or surgical treatment, intracranial bleed, or death. Anatomical bleeding sites were identified based on diagnosis codes. Results: The mean (SD) age of the study sample (N=48,260) was 67 (13) years and 62.2% of the patients were male. Mean (SD) follow-up duration was 802 (540) days (median 673 days). Over 105,419 patient-years, the critical site with the highest rate of major bleeding events was the gastrointestinal tract, followed by intracranial bleeding ( TABLE ). Table.

Patients with NVAF have a high rate of major gastrointestinal bleedings. Disclosures: Deitelzweig: Bristol-Myers Squibb/OptumInsight: Research Funding, Speakers Bureau.
