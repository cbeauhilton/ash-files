    "abstract_text": "Introduction: CDK7 is a key regulator of transcription and cell cycle progression and has been implicated in multiple tumor types driven by aberrant transcriptional (e.g., MYC- , ESR1- activation) and/or aberrant cell cycle control (e.g., loss of RB pathway checkpoint function) mechanisms. SY-5609 is a potent and selective CDK7 inhibitor currently in development in patients with solid tumors (NCT04247126). To assess the potential for SY-5609 development in heme malignancies, we evaluated SY-5609 activity in preclinical models of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). MCL is an aggressive B cell lymphoma driven by genetic alterations in RB pathway genes (e.g. CCND1, RB1, CDKN2A ) and by hyper-activation of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling leading to activation of NF-kB-dependent transcriptional programs that drive cell proliferation and survival. Our results support evaluation of SY-5609 in MCL patients and highlight the potential for combining SY-5609 with Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitors, inhibitors of BCR signal transduction approved for treatment of MCL. Methods: SY-5609 in vitro antiproliferative activity was assessed in a panel of 7 MCL cell lines by evaluating growth rate inhibition (GR) curve metrics GR 50 (drug concentration at which growth rate is inhibited by 50%) and GR max (maximum depth of response) after 5-days of treatment. SY-5609 pharmacodynamic (PD) responses and combination activity with the BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib were further assessed in MCL cell line Mino-1. PD activity was assessed by measuring transcriptional changes in POLR2A using a NanoString-based PD assay from the SY-5609 solid tumor trial. Combination activity in vitro was assessed by comparing GR curve metrics between acalabrutinib, SY-5609, and acalabrutinib in combination with SY-5609. Expression of CCND1 and E2F1, a key transcriptional regulator of DNA replication commitment and progression, were assayed via western blot. Combination activity in vivo was assessed in mice bearing Mino-1 xenograft tumors by comparing tumor growth rate inhibition (GRI) and body weight change in mice treated with acalabrutinib (15mg/kg, QD) and/or SY-5609 (0.5mg/kg, BID, days 1-7 and 15-21) over 25 days. Results: SY-5609, as a single agent, potently inhibited proliferation of all 7 MCL cell lines tested with a GR 50 geometric-mean of 7 nM (range: 2 to 20 nM) and a GR max geometric-mean of -0.2 (range: -0.6 to 0.2). In MCL cell line Mino-1, SY-5609 induced a dose-dependent increase in POLR2A expression to levels associated with SY-5609 antiproliferative activity in Mino-1 cells in vitro and to levels comparable with those observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from SY-5609 solid tumor trial patients. In combination with acalabrutinib, SY-5609 demonstrated synergistic antiproliferative activity in Mino-1 cells in vitro , a dose-dependent decrease in acalabrutinib GR 50 (up to ~2-fold at the highest SY-5609 concentration tested, 5nM), and a dose-dependent increase in GR max (up to ~10-fold). In addition, the combination of SY-5609 and acalabrutinib caused dose-dependent decreases in CCND1 and E2F1 protein expression in vitro, which were not observed with either single agent alone. Finally, in mice bearing Mino-1 xenografts, the combination of SY-5609 and acalabrutinib significantly (p < 0.01) increased tumor GRI relative to each single agent at the doses and regimens tested and was well tolerated (no difference in body weight changes relative to vehicle treated mice). Conclusions: SY-5609 is a potent and selective CDK7 inhibitor that demonstrates antiproliferative activity in MCL cells in vitro , associated with PD changes comparable to those observed in patients enrolled in the SY-5609 solid tumor trial (ENA, 2020). The combination of SY-5609 and acalabrutinib is synergistic in MCL cells in vitro and inhibits expression of key cell cycle regulatory proteins CCND1 and E2F1 at concentrations that are preclinically subtherapeutic for either single agent alone. The combination of SY-5609 and acalabrutinib is also significantly more effective at inhibiting MCL xenograft growth in vivo than either single agent. These results support evaluation of SY-5609, including in combination with BTK inhibitors, in patients with mantle cell lymphoma.
