    "abstract_text": "CDK4 and CDK6 are rarely mutated but are overexpressed or hyperactivated at a very high frequency in human cancers. By inhibiting CDK4/CDK6 with an exceptionally selective and reversible inhibitor, palbociclib (PD 0332991), we have developed a novel strategy to reprogram cancer cells for cytotoxic killing through induction of p rolonged early G1 arrest ( pG1 ). We have demonstrated that pG1 sensitizes cancer cells expressing Rb, the substrate of CDK4 and CDK6, to cytotoxic killing by forcing an imbalance in gene expression because only genes scheduled for early G1 are expressed. This sensitization is exacerbated after palbociclib withdrawal due to incomplete restoration of gene expression despite S phase synchronization ( pG1-S ). This study aims to identify genes that mediate pG1-S sensitization to two clinically-relevant agents for myeloma, the proteasome inhibitors carfilzomib and bortezomib, in model cell lines by a sensitizing pool genome-wide shRNA screen, and by validating the hits in a clinical trial of palbociclib in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. We ranked the hits based on the enrichment of target shRNAs, and representation in replica of each cell lines and among different human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) as well as functional analyses. In myeloma cells, cell cycle control by palbociclib was intact in all hits, demonstrating that CDK4 and CDK6 are indispensable for myeloma replication. Among the top ranking 20 candidates, we found that NEDD4L was essential for proteasome inhibitor killing, FTH1 modulated the threshold of killing by diverse agents especially in pG1-S , and IL10RA appeared to be required for pG1-S sensitization to proteasome inhibitors. Moreover, RNA-sequencing analysis of primary myeloma cells from a phase II clinical trial targeting CDK4/CDK6 with palbociclib in combination with bortezomib in myeloma revealed that a higher level of FTH1 expression in myeloma cells in vivo correlated with sensitivity to this therapy, suggesting a role for FTH1 in differential sensitivity to this CDK4/CDK6-based therapy in myeloma. Selective inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 with palbociclib, or another specific inhibitor such as LY2835219 or LEE011, in combination therapy has now achieved unprecedented clinical efficacy in diverse human cancers. Most notably, palbociclib more than doubled the progression free survival of metastatic breast cancer patients when it was combined with letrozole, and has been designated a \u201cbreakthrough therapy\u201d by the FDA for breast cancer. Our work provides the first insight into genes that mediate cell cycle sensitization to cytotoxic killing through selective CDK4/CDK6 inhibition. It provides an exciting potential for further investigation in a clinical context, such as the ongoing phase I clinical trial combining palbociclib with the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide in patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma.
