    "abstract_text": "Purpose: The combination of rituximab and chemotherapy has improved overall survival of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients in recent decades. Relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients previously treated with rituximab-containing regimen had significantly poorer response to salvage therapy. To study the mechanisms of this resistance, our laboratory developed several rituximab resistant cell lines. Previous study from our group found demonstrated an aberrant imbalance in the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins in these cell lines, including Bak/Bak, Mcl-1/BCLxL/Survivin and inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family proteins resulting in acquired chemotherapy resistance. MDM2 is an E3 ligase which regulates the degradation of multiple cellular protein targets such as pRB, HIF-1, p73, NF-kB, and E2F1 as well as FOXO3a. It is also the major negative regulator of p53. Recently, we found that MX69 (a MDM2 inhibitor), which blocks the MDM2 protein-XIAP RNA interaction, led to both MDM2 and XIAP degradation, and induced apoptosis-dependent cell killing activity. Moreover, MX69 re-sensitized resistant DLBCL cell lines to chemotherapy agents or small inhibitors (i.e. Venetoclax) in vitro . However, MX69 cannot be used clinically stressing the need to use a clinically available MDM2 inhibitor. To this end, we evaluated Idasanutlin, an investigational Nutlin family MDM2 antagonist, in B-cell lymphoma pre-clinical models. Methods : We used a panel of different DLBCL subtypes cell lines including activated B-cell lymphoma cell lines (TMD8, U2932); germinal center B-cell lymphoma (DOHH2, VAL, OCILY2, DH4, DH6, ROS50); rituximab-sensitive cell lines (Raji and RL); and rituximab/-resistant cell lines (Raji 4RH and RL 4RH). Cells were exposed to escalating doses of Idasanutlin (1nM-100\u00b5M) without or with other chemotherapeutic agents for 24, 48 and 72 hrs. Differences in cell viability were evaluated utilizing PrestoBlue. IC 50 was calculated by GraphPad and Coefficient of synergy was calculated using CalcuSyn. Low mitochondrial potential was detected by staining cell with DiOC6 10ng/ml for 30 minutes and followed by flow cytometric analysis. Western blot was used to detect the changes of MDM2, XIAP and PUMA expression before and after exposure to Idasanutlin 1uM for 24h. Results: In vitro exposure Idasanutlin to DLBCL cell lines demonstrated a dose- and time-dependent cell death. IC 50 dosage of the cells was ranged from 0.7uM to 63.07uM at 48h. Low dose of Idasanutlin (1uM) was able to disrupt mitochondria and induced low mitochondrial membrane potential in both ABC and GCB cell lines. At molecular level, Idasanutlin reduced expression level of MDM2 in TMD8, U2932, VAL, OCILy2 DHL4 and ROS50 cell lines. XIAP was reduced in Val and DHL4. Meanwhile, PUMA, the downstream of p53 activation, was increased after Idasanutlin exposure. Idasanutlin enhanced the anti-tumor activity of proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib, ixazomib), Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax and Bryton kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. Conclusion: Idasanutlin showed potent anti-tumor activity as a single agent in DLBCL pre-clinical setting. Idasanutlin was able to decrease cellular mitochondrial membrane potential. At molecular level, Idasanutlin decreased MDM2 and XIAP protein level and induced PUMA expression. Moreover, Idasanutlin enhanced anti-tumor activities of other small inhibitors. Taking together, Idasanutlin could be used as a novel and promising drug in the clinical setting of DLBCL with relapsed/refractory disease. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
