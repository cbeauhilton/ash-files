    "abstract_text": "T-cell exhaustion is common during chronic infections, cancer, exposure to persisting antigens, and can prevent optimal immunity. Exhausted T cells are defined by the loss of ability to perform effector functions efficiently, low proliferative capacity, and poor survival following antigen stimulation. In addition, it has become clear that exhausted T cells co-express multiple inhibitory receptors that negatively regulate their function. Indeed, receptors such as PD-1 have become major targets of clinical immunotherapies in cancer and infectious disease aimed at re-invigorating exhausted T cells. Our work has recently defined transcriptional networks of T-cell exhaustion and has focused on the role of key transcription factors, including T-bet and Eomesodermin (Eomes), in controlling the sustainability and terminal differentiation of exhausted T cell populations. Chronic infections and persisting antigen exposure often strains the sustainability or regenerative capacity of exhausted T cell populations resulting in an eventual collapse in immunity. We have found a key role for T-bet in sustaining a progenitor pool of exhausted CD8 T cells during chronic infection, while the related transcription factor Eomes governs terminal differentiation. These represent unique functions for T-bet and Eomes since these transcription factors are associated with different roles in functional memory T cells, highlighting the contextual dependence of transcriptional regulation guiding T-cell exhaustion. Additional studies are focusing on the role of other transcription factors such as BATF in T-cell activation and exhaustion, and on the role of inhibitory receptors including PD-1 in shaping the differentiation of exhausted CD8 T-cell subsets. Ultimately, a more precise molecular understanding of T-cell exhaustion should lead to novel and more robust clinical interventions to reverse exhaustion in settings of persisting infections and cancer.
