    "abstract_text": "While hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were thought to rely mainly on glycolysis for energy supply, emerging evidence suggests that defects in mitochondrial functions can impact HSPC development with respect to self-renewal, differentiation and aging. The exact mechanisms underlying metabolic reprogramming and cell fate decisions during human hematopoiesis, however, remain elusive. Biallelic mutations in the mitochondrial enzyme adenylate kinase 2 (AK2), cause reticular dysgenesis (RD), one of the most profound forms of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). AK2 catalyzes the interconversion between adenine nucleotides and thereby controls the availability of ADP for oxidative phosphorylation. Clinically, RD patients not only present with profound lymphopenia, typical for classic SCID, but also suffer from severe congenital neutropenia. The developmental arrest across the T, NK and granulocytic lineages suggests that AK2 deficiency causes a metabolic defect with global impact on hematopoiesis. Our prior work in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from RD patients has shown that maturation-arrested iPSC-derived HSPCs exhibit increased oxidative stress and an energy-depleted adenine nucleotide profile, suggesting that AK2-regulated mitochondrial bioenergetics play an integral role in HSPC differentiation. Therefore, RD serves as an excellent model to study the impact of mitochondrial metabolism during human HSPC development. Methods: Since iPSCs do not recapitulate definitive hematopoiesis, we developed an AK2 biallelic knock-out model in primary human HSPCs using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Employing a homologous recombination-mediated dual color reporter strategy, we were able to select for HSPCs with biallelic AK2 knock-out. HSPCs edited at the safe harbor AAVS1 site were used as a control. FACS purified AK2 -/- and AAVS1 -/- HSPCs were in vitro differentiated along the granulocytic lineage, and cells at various differentiation stages were sorted for RNA-seq and metabolomics analysis. Results: We analyzed the myeloid differentiation potential of AK2 -/- HSPCs in vitro . Compared to AAVS1 -/- controls, AK2 -/- HSPCs displayed a severely decreased colony forming potential of both myeloid and erythroid lineages. In addition, AK2 -/- HSPCs showed a granulocytic maturation arrest at the HLA-DR - , CD117 + promyelocyte stage, consistent with the characteristic phenotype observed in RD patients. We then performed RNA-seq studies on in vitro differentiated promyelocyte and neutrophil subpopulations derived from AK2 -/- and control HSPCs. The RNA-seq analysis showed differential gene expression in glutathione metabolism and IL-10 signaling pathways, suggesting an increase in oxidative stress and inflammation, respectively, caused by AK2 deficiency. In addition, genes implicated in antimicrobial function and granule synthesis were downregulated in AK2 -/- neutrophils, suggesting a functional defect. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) studies to delineate differences in metabolite profile conferred by AK2 deficiency at different stages of HSPC development are currently in progress. Conclusions: We have established the first cell-traceable biallelic AK2 CRISPR knock-out model in primary human HSPCs that recapitulates the myeloid phenotype of RD patients. This model allows us to profile AK2 knock-out cells at different developmental stages. AK2 -/- granulocyte precursors showed a transcriptional signature suggestive of worsening oxidative stress, inflammation and defective effector cell functions during maturation. To understand the mechanistic underpinnings for these observations we are now using a global metabolomics approach to profile the changes in energy metabolites that occur during development in AK2-deficient and control HSPC subpopulations. Understanding how metabolism governs differentiation and self-renewal of human HSPCs has important translational implications to improve hematopoietic stem cell products and transplantation outcomes.
