    "abstract_text": "Adhesion molecules have been implicated in the interactions of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with the bone marrow extracellular matrix and stromal cells. In this study we examined the role of very late antigen-5 (VLA-5) in the process of stem cell mobilization and homing after stem cell transplantation. In normal bone marrow (BM) from CBA/H mice 79\u00b13 % of the cells in the lineage negative fraction express VLA-5. After mobilization with cyclophosphamide/G-CSF, the number of VLA-5 expressing cells in mobilized peripheral blood cells (MPB) decreases to 36\u00b14%. The lineage negative fraction of MPB cells migrating in vitro towards SDF-1\u03b1 (M-MPB) demonstrated a further decrease to 3\u00b11% of VLA-5 expressing cells. These data are suggestive for a downregulation of VLA-5 on hematopoietic cells during mobilization. Next, MPB cells were labelled with PKH67-GL and transplanted in lethally irradiated recipients. Three hours after transplantation an increase in VLA-5 expressing cells was observed which remained stable until 24 hours post-transplant. When MPB cells were used the percentage PKH-67GL + Lin \u2212 VLA-5 + cells increased from 36% to 88\u00b14%. In the case of M-MPB cells the number increased from 3% to 33\u00b15%. Although the increase might implicate an upregulation of VLA-5, we could not exclude selective homing of VLA-5 + cells as a possible explanation. Moreover, we determined the percentage of VLA-5 expressing cells immediately after transplantation in the peripheral blood of the recipients and were not able to observe any increase in VLA-5 + cells in the first three hours post-tranpslant. Finally, we separated the MPB cells in VLA-5 + and VLA-5 \u2212 cells and plated these cells out in clonogenic assays for progenitor (CFU-GM) and stem cells (CAFC-day35). It could be demonstared that 98.8\u00b10.5% of the progenitor cells and 99.4\u00b10.7% of the stem cells were present in the VLA-5 + fraction. Hence, VLA-5 is not downregulated during the process of mobilization and the observed increase in VLA-5 expressing cells after transplantation is indeed caused by selective homing of VLA-5 + cells. To shed more light on the role of VLA-5 in the process of homing, BM and MPB cells were treated with an antibody to VLA-5. After VLA-5 blocking of MPB cells an inhibition of 59\u00b17% in the homing of progenitor cells in bone marrow could be found, whereas homing of these subsets in the spleen of the recipients was only inhibited by 11\u00b14%. For BM cells an inhibition of 60\u00b112% in the bone marrow was observed. Homing of BM cells in the spleen was not affected at all after VLA-5 blocking. Based on these data we conclude that mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells does not coincide with a downregulation of VLA-5. The observed increase in VLA-5 expressing cells after transplantation is caused by preferential homing of VLA-5 + cells. Homing of progenitor/stem cells to the bone marrow after transplantation apparantly requires adhesion interactions that can be inhibited by blocking VLA-5 expression. Homing to the spleen seems to be independent of VLA-5 expression. These data are indicative for different adhesive pathways in the process of homing to bone marrow or spleen.",
