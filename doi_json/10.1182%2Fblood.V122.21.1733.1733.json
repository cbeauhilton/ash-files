    "abstract_text": "Introduction Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has become an important strategy for treatment of several diseases. However, in developing countries access is often limited by socioeconomic factors. The information about the costs of the procedure in Mexico is scarce which limits the development of public policies in the area. Objective Describe overall costs of HSCT as well as specific costs of resources used in a tertiary care center in Mexico City. Material and Methods Retrospective, descriptive, observational study. We calculated the median overall cost per transplant in the first 30 days and the median cost per resource category, using SPSS version 17. Results We evaluated a total of 50 TCPH from June 2010 to December 2012. Of all the procedures, 68% were autologous. The median cost for allo-HSCT was $ 24.910 USD, while for auto-HSCT was $14.742 USD. Specific charges were divided into the following areas: for allo-HSCT, conditioning chemotherapy and mobilization: $ 4.087 USD, hospitalization: $ 8.130 USD, laboratory studies: $ 3.922 USD, imaging: $ 1.012 USD, other medications: $ 5.278 USD, blood bank: $ 2.478 USD. For auto-HSCT, conditioning-mobilization: $ 4.997 USD, hospitalization $ 4.086 USD, laboratory $ 1.612 USD, imaging: $ 411 USD, other medications: $ 3.024 USD, blood bank: $ 611 USD. Estimated 5 year-overall survival for these patients was 71.6%. Conclusions These results contribute to the scarce information regarding costs of HSCT in our country. The cost of HSCT in INCMNSZ (government institution) is 10 times lower than in the U.S. with similar results regarding overall survival. These facts highlight the important role of non-profit institutions that contribute to the development of these programs. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
