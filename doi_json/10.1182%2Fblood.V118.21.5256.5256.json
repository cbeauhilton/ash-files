    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5256 BACKGROUND: Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is multi-causal disease associated to a high morbi-mortality due to complications as pulmonary embolism and post-flebitic syndrome. The incidence is about 20 to 30%, and 25% of the patients will present recurrence in 5 years. The identification of new risk factors is important in clinical practice to prevent new thrombotic events. The role of the platelets on DVT is still not well defined. AIM: The objective of this study was to analyze the hole proteins profile of platelets obtained from DVT patients and compare to the same matherial derived from healthy controls. PATIENTS: peripheral blood samples were collected from 3 spontaneous DVT patients and from 1 sibling and 1 neighbor for each patient in order to minimize the genetic and environmental interferences. These patients presented spontaneous and recurrent episodes of lower limbs proximal DVT and all of them mentioned a familiar history of coagulation disorders. METHODS: the platelets were washed, lysed, and the proteins were alkylated, reduced, precipitated with acetone and hydrolyzed by trypsin. 100mg of peptides were then separated by hydrophobicity using HPLC, and 8 fractions were obtained and directed to the LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The proteins search was performed by Sorcerer-SEQUEST. RESULTS: We identified 5 proteins that were present on patients and absent in all the controls: Apolipoprotein A1 Binding-Protein, Coatomer (z1 sub-unit), Estradiol 11\u201317-b Dehydrogenase, Leucotriene A-4 Hydrolase and Sorbitol Dehydrogenase. Western-Blotting was performed with specific antibodies and validated the results. CONCLUSIONS: with this study it was possible to identify proteins up to date non-related to the physiopathology of DVT, that could be involved with metabolic and inflammatory processes.
