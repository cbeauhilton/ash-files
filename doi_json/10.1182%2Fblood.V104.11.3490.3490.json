    "abstract_text": "Chromosomal rearrangements affecting RUNX1 and CBFB are common in acute leukemias. These mutations result in the expression of fusion proteins that act in a dominant negative manner to suppress the normal function of the CBF \u03b2/RUNX1 complex. In addition, loss-of-function mutations in RUNX1 have been identified in sporadic cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in association with familial platelet disorder with propensity to develop AML (FPD/AML). In order to examine the hypothesis that decreased gene dosage of RUNX1 may be a critical event in the development of leukemia, we treated chimeric mice generated from Runx1lacZ/lacZ embryonic stem (ES) cells that have homozygous disruption of the RUNX1 gene, as well as Runx1+/lacZ mice with N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea (ENU). The heterozygous Runx1+/lacZ mice did not show increased incidence of any malignancy. On the other hand, we observed an increased incidence of precursor T-lymphoblastic lymphoma in Runx1lacZ/lacZ compared to wild-type chimeras, and confirmed that the tumors were of ES cell origin. It was determined by PCR that Runx1lacZ/lacZ ES cells contributed to the T cell progenitor population in the chimeras prior to leukemia development, which may explain the tissue-specificity of the malignancy we observed. Our results suggest that deficiency of Runx1 can indeed predispose mice to hematopoietic malignancies.",
