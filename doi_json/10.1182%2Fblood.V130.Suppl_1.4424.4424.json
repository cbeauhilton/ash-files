    "abstract_text": "Background: Despite remarkable progress in treatment options of multiple myeloma (MM) over the last decade with proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), most of patients with high-risk multiple myeloma (MM) relapse and ultimately become refractory. Recently, novel monoclonal antibody directly targeting CS1(elotuzumab) or CD38 (daratuzumab) induced durable responses in patients with multidrug-refractory MM. CD26, a 110-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein which is expressed on several tumor cells including malignant lymphoma, has been implicated in tumorigenesis, whereas its role in plasma cell malignancies has not been characterized yet. Our recent work has revealed that CD26 is intensely expressed on activated osteoclasts (OCs) in MM. In addition, in vitro studies showed that although CD26 expression is only slightly detected on MM cell lines cultured alone, it is intensely and uniformly expressed on MM cell lines co-cultured with OCs. In this study, we clarify the direct on-tumor and immune mechanism of action with huCD26mAb, a humanized monoclonal IgG 1 antibody specifically targeting CD26, alone or in combination with approved agents in high-risk MM. Methods and Results: Immunostaining on bone marrow biopsy specimens showed that CD26 is expressed on plasma cells in several MM patients, but not in those of healthy individuals. So, we first analyzed the effect of huCD26mAb on survival of MM cell lines (KMS18, KMS26, KMS27, KMS28, KMS34, U266). HuCD26mAb had no direct effect on proliferation in any of tested CD26- MM cell lines cultured alone, but it inhibited growth of CD26+ MM cell lines co-cultured with OCs at higher concentrations (>10\u03bcg/ml), as measured by the MTT assay. Next, we examined the ability of huCD26mAb to lyse CD26 positive MM cell lines by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) using the calcein-AM release assay. HuCD26mAb, but not isotype control IgG 1 , triggered ADCC against CD26+ KMS18, KMS26, KMS28, KMS34 and U266 with t(4;14) by natural killer (NK) effector cells in a dose-dependent manner with lytic activity starting at 0.0001\u03bcg/ml and maximum lysis at 10\u03bcg/ml and in an effector to target (E/T) ratio-dependent manner. Moreover, huCD26mAb dose-dependently induced lysis of lenalidomide-resistant MM.1R via ADCC. We further asked whether pretreatment with conventional or novel agents is able to induce superior ADCC activity by huCD26mAb. CD26+ KMS18, KMS26 and KMS28 were pretreated with bortezomib (3nM), lenamlidomide (0.5\u03bcM) or dexamethasone (25nM) overnight. Indeed, subsequent MM cell lysis triggered by huCD26mAb (10\u03bcg/ml) was significantly augumented. Treatment with lenalidomide (0.5\u03bcM) followed by huCD26mAb (10\u03bcg/ml) also markedly reduced the viable MM.1R in the presence of NK effector cells. The synergistic ADCC efficacy of huCD26mAb in combination with lenalidomide resulted in 2.0-fold increase in MM.1R lysis. In addition, pretreatment of NK effector cells with lenalidomide also potentiated ADCC against MM.1R mediated by huCD26mAb in a dose-dependent fashion. Complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) of CD26+ MM cells by huCD26mAb was also tested using human serum as a source of complement. However, in the presence of human serum, the incubation with huCD26mAb or isotype IgG 1 exerted no effect on MM cell lysis. These results indicate that huCD26mAb (\u226610\u03bcg/ml) kills CD26+ MM cells by inducing ADCC but not CDC, regardless of sensitivity or resistance to conventional or novel agents. Finally, to further determine whether huCD26mAb alone or combination with lenalidomide affects side population (SP) fractions of drug-resistant MM cells, we first examined CD26 expression in SP and main population (MP) fractions by flow cytometry. Both CD26+ RPMI8226 and KMS11 exhibited SP fractions which equally expressed CD26 at high levels as MP fractions. So, we examined ADCC activity by huCD26mAb (10\u03bcg/ml) against these SP fractions, mixed with NK effector cells. Interestingly, although lenalidomide alone did not decrease the ratio of SP fractions, huCD26mAb substantially reduced their ratio and its further reduction was observed with both in combination against CD26+ RPMI8226 and KMS11. Conclusions: HuCD26mAb induced significant anti-MM efficacy chiefly through ADCC. CD26 may be a novel valuable target for antibody therapy and huCD26mAb, alone or in combination, may be a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of high-risk MM.
