    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1695 Background: A global, prospective registry was established to document the frequency of diagnostic testing, management (mgmt) strategies, and outcomes of patients (pts) with CML. Here, we summarize the reported deviations from published disease mgmt recommendations and the overall efficacy achieved by pts. Methods: 1853 pts (\u2265 16 years of age) within 6 months (mo) + 2 weeks of CML diagnosis were enrolled from Latin America (LA; n = 497), United States (US; n = 379), Asia Pacific (AP; n = 465), Middle East and Africa (MEA; n = 209), and Russia and Turkey (RT; n = 303). Baseline demographics and medical history were collected at enrollment; current disease status and mgmt information were collected at approximately 6-mo intervals or with a change in disease status or mgmt. Results: From February 2008 to June 2011, data were available for 1831 (99%) pts. Across all regions, nearly all (93.8%) screened pts were in chronic phase CML. Regardless of the time of evaluation (eval), disease burden was mostly assessed through the use of hematologic counts ( Table 1 ). Cytogenetic testing and molecular monitoring were used in a minority of pts at any timepoint. Hydroxyurea (HU) and imatinib were the first agents used in 61.9% and 29.5% of pts, respectively ( Table 2 ). Overall, 81.1% of pts received imatinib therapy at some time and it was the most common second agent (48.1%) pts received. Among the 49% of pts who had response assessments, subsequent treatment changes occurred most frequently (23.9% of pts) at the 3-mo timepoint ( Table 1 ). The median time from disease eval to dose/regimen modification was 3 days. Of those who received imatinib, 32% had dose modifications primarily for: lack of efficacy (20%), physician request (20%), and adverse events (19%). Of the pts with a corresponding eval at 12 mo after diagnosis, 88% had a CHR, 65.4% had a CCyR, and 42.5% had a MMR (BCR-ABL IS \u2264.1%). These data are preliminary; response assessments by treatment, as well as further efficacy analyses, are ongoing. Conclusions: Overall, the majority of pts did not have cytogenetic or BCR-ABL transcript level testing performed per the European LeukemiaNet recommendations. Furthermore, despite availability of more effective therapies for the treatment of CML, HU is still used as a primary therapy in a substantial proportion of pts. Based on this analysis, pts outside the US primarily receive HU as initial therapy rather than tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Overall, second-generation TKIs, such as nilotinib and dasatinib, are infrequently used. These results illustrate the need for continuing education on the mgmt of CML in order to improve outcomes for all pts. Table 1  .
