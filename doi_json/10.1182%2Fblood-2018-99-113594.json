    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematological malignancy in the U.S. with an estimated 30,700 new diagnoses in 2018. It is a clonal disease of plasma cells that, despite recent therapeutic advances, remains incurable. Myeloma cells retain numerous characteristics of normal plasma cells including reliance on survival signals in the bone marrow for long term viability. However, malignant transformation of plasma cells imparts the ability to proliferate, causing harmful bone lesions in patients, and in advanced stages independence of the bone-marrow microenvironment. Therefore, we are investigating the molecular mechanisms of myeloma cell survival that allow them to become extramedullary. We identified syntenin-1 (SDCBP) as a protein involved in myeloma cell survival and a potential therapeutic target. Syntenin-1 is an adapter protein that has been shown to regulate surface expression of several transmembrane proteins by binding with membrane phospholipids and mediating vesicular trafficking of proteins throughout the cell. Syntenin-1 regulates the surface expression of CD138, a plasma/myeloma cell marker. Syntenin-1 has been shown to regulate apoptosis in numerous cancer cell lines including breast cancer, glioma, and pancreatic cancer but its role in multiple myeloma survival has not been studied. To determine if syntenin-1 expression has an effect on myeloma cell survival, we utilized the CoMMpass dataset (IA12), a longitudinal study of myeloma patients that includes transcriptomic analysis throughout treatment. We found that patients with the highest expression of syntenin-1 mRNA (top quartile) had significantly worse overall survival, progression-free survival, and a shorter response duration than those in the bottom quartile of expression. To determine if syntenin-1 has a role in myeloma cell survival, we used short hairpin RNA to knock down syntenin-1 (shsyn) in RPMI 8226 and MM1.s myeloma cell lines. We then determined the amount of cell death using Annexin-V staining flow cytometry four days following lentiviral infection. We found increased cell death in syntenin-1-silenced cells compared to our empty vector control in both RPMI 8226 (control=42.17%, shsyn=71.53%, p=0.04) and MM1.s cell lines (control=8.57%, shsyn=29.9%, p=0.04) suggesting that syntenin-1 is important for myeloma cell survival. Syntenin-1 contains two PDZ domains that allow it to bind to receptor proteins via their corresponding PDZ-binding motifs. We therefore wanted to look at correlation of syntenin-1 expression with CD138 and CD86, two PDZ-binding domain containing proteins expressed on the surface of myeloma cells. Using the CoMMpass dataset, we found patients with high expression of syntenin-1 had a median expression of CD86 that was twice as high as the total population (P<0.0001) while syntenin-1-low patients expressed CD86 at levels that were half as much as the population (P<0.0001). In contrast, there was no clear relationship between syntenin-1 and CD138 mRNA expression. Indeed if one takes into account all patients, there is a positive correlation between CD86 and syntenin-1 expression (r=0.228, P<0.0001) while there is a negative correlation between CD138 and syntenin-1 (r=-0.1923, P<0.0001). The correlation with CD86 but not CD138 suggests a previously undescribed role for syntenin-1 in myeloma cells. Our lab has previously shown that expression of CD86 is necessary for myeloma cell survival, and signals via its cytoplasmic domain to confer drug resistance. Silencing syntenin-1 results in a decrease in CD86 surface expression. However, there is no change in CD86 transcript or total cellular CD86 protein levels in our shsyn treated cells. Moreover, knockdown of CD86 resulted in increased protein expression and transcript levels of syntenin-1. Taken together, these data suggest that syntenin-1 may regulate CD86 expression on the cell surface. Our data supports a novel role for syntenin-1 in myeloma cell viability and as a potential regulator of CD86 surface expression. The role of syntenin-1 has not previously been explored in multiple myeloma and determining its molecular function is warranted as it may be an attractive target for therapeutic treatment of the disease.
