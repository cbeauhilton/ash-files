    "abstract_text": "The influence of graft composition on clinical outcomes after non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation is not well characterized. In this report we evaluated the influence of CD34 + , CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD8 + cell doses on donor engraftment, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), freedom from progression (FFP), and overall survival (OS). Patients (n=63) were given total body irradiation 200 cGy (n=8) or total body irradiation 200 cGy plus fludarabine (n=55) followed by allografting with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cell (G-PBMC). The median age was 53 years, and donors were HLA-identical siblings (n=38) or HLA-matched unrelated individuals (n=25). Almost all patient were treated for a hematologic malignancy (n=60), with 30 patients (48%) characterized as having advanced diseases. G-PBMC cell doses were prospectively enumerated by FACS analysis at the time of collection. Median donor G-PBMC cell doses were 7.4x10 6 CD34 + /kg (range: 1.9\u201317.7), 3.2x10 8 CD3 + /kg (range: 0.8\u20136.4), 2.1x10 8 CD4 + /kg (range: 0.4\u20134.1), and 1.1x10 8 CD8 + /kg (range: 0.2\u20133.4). By univariate analysis only G-PBMC CD8 + T-cell dose \u2265 the 50 th percentile favorably correlated with attainment of full donor blood T-cell chimerism ( P = .03). The incidences of grade 2\u20134 acute GVHD was 16.3% (95% CI: 6.9\u201325.8) and extensive chronic GVHD was 42.9% (95% CI: 27.8\u201357.9). No G-PBMC cell dose significantly influenced grade 2\u20134 acute or extensive chronic GVHD. With a median follow-up of 13 months (range: 5\u201345), estimates for FFP was 53.7% (95% CI: 37.7\u201369.7) and OS was 33.4% (95% CI: 17.4\u201349.4). G-PBMC CD8 + T-cell dose \u2265 the 50 th percentile T-cell dose was favorably prognostic for both FFP ( P = .001) and OS ( P = .01). Survival curves for FFP and OS are shown in Figure 1. Extensive chronic GVHD also predicted better FFP ( P = .02), but in multivariate analysis only G-PBMC CD8 + T-cell dose ( P = .004; RR = 0.2, 95% CI = 0.1\u20130.6) was associated with improved FFP. Infusion of low G-PBMC CD8 + T-cell dose for non-myeloablative allografting with total body irradiation 200 cGy plus fludarabine may adversely affect donor T-cell engraftment, disease progression and survival outcomes.
