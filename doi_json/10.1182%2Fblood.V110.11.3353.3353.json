    "abstract_text": "p73 is a member of the p53-family of transcription factors (p73, p53 and p63). A truncated form of p73 (\u0394Np73) also exists that lacks the transcriptional activation domain and inhibits both p53 & p73. However, \u0394Np73 transcripts have not been reported in normal tissues or peripheral blood. We now show for the first time that \u0394Np73 mRNA and protein are not present in quiescent (G 0 ), primary human T cells but are induced post the G 0 \u2192G 1 cell cycle commitment point following stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 or PMA/ionomycin. The \u0394 Np73 transcript could be produced either by activation of a promoter in intron 3 or from the 5\u2032 P1 promoter by alternative splicing. Bisulfite sequencing shows that the intron 3 promoter is hypermethylated in T cells in G 0 and throughout the cell cycle while the 5\u2032 P1 promoter remains largely unmethylated. 5\u2032-RACE results with quiescent and stimulated T cells verify that \u0394 Np73 transcripts originate from the P1 promoter. Additionally, RT-PCR analyses show that the transcript originating from the P1 promoter is present in G 0 and mature \u0394 Np73 mRNA is produced by cell cycle-dependent splicing during the G 0 \u2192G 1 transition. We investigated the function of \u0394Np73 during G 0 \u2192G 1 by inhibiting its induction with two different siRNAs. Microarray analyses show that expression of mRNA encoding a number of cell cycle regulators like E2F1, TCFL2 and CDT1 during G 0 \u2192G 1 are dependent on \u0394Np73 and \u0394Np73 represses the expression of the pro-apoptotic PUMA, a known p73 target. We conclude that \u0394Np73 is produced in normal, human T cells during cell cycle entry and regulates normal gene expression. Moreover, the intron 3 promoter is hypermethylated, the \u0394 Np73 transcript originates at the P1 promoter and \u0394 Np73 mRNA is produced by cell cycle-dependent splicing."
