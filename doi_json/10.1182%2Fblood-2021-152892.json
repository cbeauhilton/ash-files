    "abstract_text": "Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a recessive monogenic disease caused by a single point mutation in which glutamic acid replaces valine in Codon 6 of the human beta-globin gene (HBB) leading to the production of abnormal globin chains (HbS) that polymerize and cause erythrocytes to sickle. This results in hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusion and organ damage, which leads to lifelong complications and early mortality. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) is the only known cure for SCD, however, its use is limited by the lack of well-matched donors, need for immunosuppression, risk of graft versus host disease and graft rejection. GPH101 is an investigational, autologous, hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) drug product (DP) designed to correct the SCD mutation in the HBB gene ex vivo using a high fidelity Cas9 (CRISPR associated protein 9) paired with an AAV6 (adeno-associated virus type 6) delivery template, efficiently harnessing the natural homology directed repair (HDR) cellular pathway. This approach has the potential to restore normal adult hemoglobin (HbA) production while simultaneously reducing HbS levels. In preclinical studies, HBB gene correction in SCD donor HSCs resulted in \u226560% of gene-corrected alleles in vitro with minimal off-target effects. Gene corrected cells were successfully differentiated toward the erythroid lineage and produced \u226570% HbA in vitro. Long-term engraftment of gene-corrected HSCs was demonstrated in vivo, following transplant into immunodeficient mice, with multi-lineage allelic gene correction frequencies well above the predicted curative threshold of 20%, with potential of this approach to be equivalent or superior to allo-HSCT. In addition, HSC-based correction in an SCD mouse model led to stable adult hemoglobin production, increased erythrocyte lifespan and reduction in sickling morphology, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of this gene correction platform as a curative approach in SCD. Study Design and Methods CEDAR (NCT04819841) is a first-in-human, open-label, single-dose, multi-site Phase 1/2 clinical trial in participants with severe SCD designed to evaluate safety, efficacy and pharmacodynamics (PD) of GPH101. Approximately 15 adult (18-40 years) and adolescent (12-17 years) participants will be enrolled across 5 sites, with adolescent enrollment proceeding after a favorable assessment of adult safety data by a Safety Monitoring Committee. Participants must have a diagnosis of severe SCD (\u03b2S/\u03b2S), defined as \u2265 4 severe vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) in the 2 years prior and/or \u2265 2 episodes of acute chest syndrome (ACS), in 2 years prior with at least 1 episode in the past year. Participants on chronic transfusion therapy may be eligible if required VOC and ACS criteria are met in the 2 years prior to the initiation of transfusions. Key exclusion criteria include availability of a 10/10 human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donor, or prior receipt of HSCT or gene therapy. After eligibility confirmation including screening for pre-treatment cytogenetic abnormalities, participants will undergo plerixafor mobilization and apheresis, followed by CD34+ cell enrichment and cryopreservation, undertaken locally at each trial site before shipment to a centralized manufacturer for GPH101 production. After GPH101 release, participants will undergo eligibility reconfirmation prior to busulfan conditioning and DP infusion. Safety, efficacy and PD measurements will occur for 2 years post-infusion; a long-term follow up study will be offered to participants for an additional 13 years of monitoring. The primary endpoint for this study is safety, measured by the kinetics of HSC engraftment, transplant related mortality, overall survival and frequency and severity of adverse events. Secondary endpoints will explore efficacy and PD, including levels of globin expression as compared to baseline, gene correction rates, clinical manifestations of SCD (including VOC and ACS), laboratory parameters, complications and organ function. In addition, cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen delivery will be assessed by magnetic resonance techniques. Key exploratory endpoints include evaluation of patient-reported outcomes, erythrocyte function, on-target and off-target editing rates, and change from baseline in select SCD characteristics.
