    "abstract_text": "Lenalidomide (Revlimid\u00ae is approved for the treatment of transfusion-dependent patients with anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a del 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities, and in combination with dexamethasone is for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy. Encouraging early results suggest a potential for clinical efficacy in B cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL). Potential mechanisms of action include anti-angiogenic, anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory activities. Lenalidomide has been shown to enhance Th1-type cytokines and T cell and NK cell activation markers in patients with advanced cancers. Furthermore, lenalidomide has been shown to enhance rituximab-mediated protection in a SCID mouse lymphoma model in vivo. We have utilized an in vitro ADCC system to assess the ability of lenalidomide to directly enhance human NK cell function in response to therapeutic antibodies, such as rituximab (chimeric anti-CD20 mAb). Isolated NK cells produced little or no IFN-\u03b3 in response to IgG and/or IL-2 or IL-12. However, pre-treatment of NK cells with lenalidomide greatly enhanced IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells in a dose-dependent manner. In a functional ADCC assay, NHL cell lines (Namalwa, Farage & Raji) were pre-coated with rituximab and exposed to NK cells pre-treated with lenalidomide in the presence of either exogenous IL-2 or IL-12. After 4 hours in culture the viability of the tumor cells was assessed. Lenalidomide consistently and synergistically increased the killing of tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner and up to >4-fold compared to rituximab alone. Rituximab alone had only a small effect in this model and there was no killing of cells in the absence of rituximab. The presence of either exogenous IL-2 or IL-12 was required to see enhanced killing by lenalidomide. In cancer patients lenalidomide has been shown to increase serum IL-12 levels and is also known to induce IL-2 production by T cells in vitro. Potential mechanisms for enhanced ADCC include increased signaling through NK FC\u03b3 receptors and/or IL-2 or IL-12 receptors. However, we found that these receptors are unaffected by lenalidomide, although downstream effects on NK signaling pathways are likely and are being actively investigated. In conclusion, we have shown that lenalidomide strongly enhances the ability of rituximab to induce ADCC mediated killing of NHL cells in vitro. This provides a strong rationale for combination of these drugs in patients with NHL and CLL.",
