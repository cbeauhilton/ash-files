    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3153 Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) is characterized by high cure rates. Approximately 90% early stage and 60\u201370% advanced stage patients have long term disease free survival. In Brazil it is observed that about 60% of patients present with advanced stage, while in developed countries about 40% belong to this group. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze data of patients with HL from the Oncohematology Unit of University of Sa\u0303o Paulo- Medical School and evaluate the event free survival (EFS) and the overall survival (OS) according to clinical stage. We included all consecutive patients diagnosed with HL between January 1991 and June 2010. The collection of data from medical records was done and the following variables at diagnosis were evaluated: age and sex, staging according to Cotswolds modified Ann-Arbor criteria (CS), histological subtype, presence of B symptoms and bulky disease, International Prognostic Index (IPI) according to International Prognostic Factors Project on Advanced Hodgkin's Disease, laboratorial data, and the protocol used in first line therapy. The complete remission (CR) rate, EFS and OS were analyzed in all patients. The survival analysis was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and the survival curves were compared by the log-rank test. Differences in CR rates among staging groups were compared using the chi squared test. Overall, 564 HL patients were identified; thirteen did not have adequate information about clinical staging and were excluded from the analysis. The median age, at diagnosis, of the remaining 551 patients was 28 (12\u201383) and 54.3% were male. Histological subtypes lymphocyte rich classical HL, nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity and lymphocyte depletion were found in 3.6%, 51.4%, 24.2% and 5.6% cases, respectively, and 11.8% patients were diagnosed as HL classic not classifiable otherwise. Nodular lymphocyte predominance was observed in 3.3% cases. Stage I, II, III and IV were found in 42 (7.6%), 208 (37.7%), 145 (26.3%) e 156 (28.3%) patients, respectively. B symptoms and bulky disease were present in 65.5%and 58.8% patients, respectively. After staging the patients were divided in three groups: group 1 -CS I/II, without B symptoms nor bulky disease= 62 (11.25%) patients, group 2 -CS I/ II, with B symptoms and/or bulky disease=188 (34.12%) patients and group 3- CS III/ IV= 301 (54.62%) patients. IPI high risk score was recognized in 63.9% patients of group 3. Only 1.5% of patients were treated with exclusive radiotherapy. Of the patients that were treated with chemotherapy, 4.9% were treated with MOPP, 23.1% with MOPPABV, 70.5% with ABVD and 1.5% with other types of chemotherapy. The median follow-up of the entire cohort was 59.6 months (0\u2013258.8 months) and 88.3% (CI 95%: 85.2%-91.1%) were in CR at the end of treatment (CS I: 100%, CS II: 90.6% CS III: 84.6% and CS IV: 85.3%; p=0.03) (group 1: 98.2%, group 2: 90.2% and group 3: 84.9%; p=0.012). The 5-year EFS rate was 69.2% (CS I: 84.8%; CS II: 77.8%; CS III: 64.5%, CS IV: 56%; p=0.0008) (group 1: 88%, group 2: 76% and group 3: 60.3%; p=0.0002) ( Figures 1 and 2 ). The 5-year OS rate was 86.44% (CS I: 90.3%, CS II: 94.6%, CS III: 87.6%, CS IV: 71.4%; p<0.0001) (group 1: 98.3%, group 2: 92.6% and group 3: 79, 6%; p=0.0003). Figure 1 View large Download slide Figure 1 View large Download slide Figure 2 View large Download slide Figure 2 View large Download slide We found that there were more advanced stage patients (stage III/IV) in comparison to developed countries, however, patients classified as stage I/II without poor prognostic factors, like B symptoms and/or bulky disease, showed high rates of CR, EFS and OS. These data suggest that there is a need to enhance early diagnosis in Brazilian patients, in order to detect less advanced stage patients due to late diagnosis.
