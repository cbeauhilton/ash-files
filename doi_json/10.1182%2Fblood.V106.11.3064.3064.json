    "abstract_text": "Mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a GTPase activating protein for Ras called neurofibromin. NF1 is a genetic disorder that affects approximately 250,000 individuals in the US, Europe, and Japan alone. Neurofibromas, the hallmark of NF1, are complex tumors characterized by tumorigenic Schwann cells, neoangiogenesis, fibrosis, and degranulating mast cells. Studies in experimental models have emphasized the role of inflammatory cells in altering the microenvironment and facilitating malignant outgrowth. Similarly, Parada (Science, 2002) found that nullizygosity of Nf1 in Schwann cells of conditional knockout mice ( Krox20;Nf1 flox/flox ) was necessary but not sufficient for neurofibroma formation and haploinsufficiency of Nf1 in lineages within the tumor microenvironment was required for neurofibroma progression. We previously provided the first genetic, cellular, and biochemical evidence that haploinsufficiency of Nf1 alters Ras activity and cell fates in mast cells (JEM, 2000, 2001) and identified a mechanism underlying the recruitment of mast cells to tumorigenic Schwann cells (JCI 2003). However, it remains unclear whether Nf1 +/ \u2212 bone marrow derived hematopoietic cells can directly contribute to neurofibroma formation in vivo . To address this question, Nf1+/ \u2212 or wildtype (WT) EGFP+ bone marrow (BM) was adoptively transferred into lethally irradiated Krox20;Nf1 flox/flox mice and cohorts were followed prospectively for tumor formation using positron emission tomography and computerized axial tomography. Mice transplanted with Nf1+/ \u2212 but not WT BM developed progressive enlargement of the trigeminal nerve, dorsal root ganglia, peripheral nerves, and motor paralysis similar to Krox20; Nf1 flox/ \u2212 mice that are haploinsufficient at Nf1 in all lineages of the tumor microenvironment. Postmortem analysis revealed that Krox20;Nf1 flox/flox mice transplanted with Nf1+/ \u2212 BM had cellular neurofibromas containing Schwann cells, fibroblasts, blood vessels and mast cells, which closely resembled the cellular architecture of human neurofibromas. Mice transplanted with WT BM did not develop neurofibromas. These studies establish that recruitment of Nf1 +/ \u2212 BM derived cells to the neurofibroma microenvironment is directly linked to neurofibroma formation and progression. Given our observations, therapies which prevent both the recruitment and the tumor promoting functions of Nf1 +/ \u2212 hematopoietic cells in neurofibroma formation are currently being tested in vivo as pre-clinical trials.",
