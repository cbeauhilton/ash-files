    "abstract_text": "Abstract 190 Introduction: Overexpression of Bcl-2 in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is associated with enhanced CLL-cell resistance to spontaneous or chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. The BH3 mimetic protein navitoclax (ABT-263) specifically inhibits Bcl-2, and related proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-w, and can induce apoptosis of CLL cells in vitro. Phase I evaluation in relapsed/refractory CLL patients demonstrated 35% overall response rate (Roberts, 2012). Dose-limiting thrombocytopenia due to Bcl-xL inhibition was mitigated using a lead-in dosing schedule to allow the bone marrow to achieve a compensatory increase in platelets prior to dose escalation to the MTD of 250 mg. Based on the promising single-agent data, a Phase II trial randomized trial compared the safety, pharmacokinetics, and biologic activity of treatment with navitoclax and rituximab (RTX) versus RTX alone. Methods: Patients with CLL who required initial treatment according to iwCLL criteria (Hallek et al, 2008) were stratified by Binet stage and high-risk cytogenetic features (17p deletion and/or 11q deletion), and randomized 1:1:1 to receive RTX weekly for 8 wks (375 mg/m 2 wk 1, 500 mg/m 2 wks 2\u20138) (Arm A), or RTX for 8 wks plus navitoclax daily for 12 wks (250 mg/day following a 7\u201314 day lead-in period of 100 mg/day) (Arm B), or RTX for 8 wks plus navitoclax daily as in Arm B, but continued treatment with navitoclax until disease progression, relapse, or unacceptable toxicity (Arm C). Arm A to Arm B crossover was permitted. Response rate was assessed by iwCLL CLL response criteria at week 12, and every 12 weeks during follow-up. The study was stopped after the last patient had completed \u2265 12 weeks of treatment and week-12 response assessment. Results: Baseline characteristics and prognostic factors for the 118 randomized patients were generally balanced among the three treatment arms. Median age was 63 years (range 38\u201394), and 55% were Binet stage B+C. Median baseline lymphocyte count was 53,000 mm 3 (range 7,000\u2013552,000/mm 3 ). FISH analyses identified higher than expected rates of deletion of 11q or 17p in the CLL cells of 32% or 28% of patients, respectively. Median time on study was 32 weeks overall (24 wks for Arm A, 33 wks Arm B, and 44 wks Arm C). AEs of Grade 3\u20134 that were more common (> 5% greater) in a navitoclax-treated arm compared with the RTX arm included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, GI symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain), chills, fatigue, ALT/AST/bilirubin elevations, and infusion-related reactions (to RTX). Thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and hepatic enzyme elevations were generally reversible when navitoclax was stopped and/or dose-reduced; however, 12 patients (15%) discontinued navitoclax due to laboratory abnormalities (9 due to ALT elevations). Neutropenia responded to growth factors. One serious event of epistaxis occurred related to the thrombocytopenia. Two deaths occurred on study, one on the RTX-only arm due to a pulmonary embolus and one on Arm B due to hypotension and dyspnea related to a severe RTX infusion reaction. Investigator-assessed objective response (CR and PR) rate was 35% for Arm A, 55% for Arm B (p=0.19 vs A), and 70% for Arm C (p=0.0034 vs A). All responses were PRs except for 2 CRs in Arm C. All responses were confirmed by CT (and BM for CR) \u2265 8 wks after clinical response assessment. While the presence of 17p deletion appeared to result in a lower response rate to RTX alone (Arm A, ORR 18%, 2/11 pts), it did not appear to affect the response to ABT-263 and RTX (Arm B, ORR 73%, 8/11 pts); Arm C, ORR 50%, 5/10 pts. Limited PFS results appeared consistent with the responses by arm, with a longer PFS associated with the longer duration of ABT-263 treatment on Arm C; however, the magnitude of PFS differences could not be precisely quantified due to the limited follow-up and patient number. Preliminary pharmacokinetic analysis did not detect any drug interaction between navitoclax and RTX. Conclusions: Navitoclax in combination with RTX weekly \u00d7 8 was generally well-tolerated as initial therapy for CLL patients and demonstrated greater clinical activity than treatment with RTX alone as well as responses in patients with 17p deletion. The preliminary results of this study indicate that a BH3-mimetic inhibitor of Bcl-2 could be highly effective when used in combination with RTX for treatment of patients with CLL.
