    "abstract_text": "The integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 resides on the platelet surface in an equilibrium between inactive and active conformations that can be shifted in either direction by altering the distance between the stalks that anchor \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in the platelet membrane. Accordingly, the \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 transmembrane (TM) domains, located near the ends of the stalks, are in proximity when \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is inactive and separate upon \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation. Peptides corresponding to these domains undergo both homomeric and heteromeric interactions in biological membranes. Thus, it is possible that the shift between inactive and active \u03b1IIb\u03b23 conformations is accompanied by a shift from heteromeric to homomeric \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 TM domain interactions. Indeed, we reported that introducing Asn, a residue known to strengthen homomeric TM helix interactions, into the \u03b23 TM domain shifts \u03b1IIb\u03b23 to an active state. As a further test of this model of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 regulation, we studied the effects of mutations of the \u03b1IIb TM domain. First, we placed Asn at 10 consecutive positions in the \u03b1IIb TM domain, extending from residues V969 to L978, and co-expressed each mutant with WT \u03b23 in CHO cells. Only one of the mutants, G972N, was constitutively active, binding ~ 8-fold more fibrinogen than WT \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Moreover, G972N was expressed in non-uniform patches on the CHO cell surface, consistent with the formation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 clusters. G972 is the first residue of a GxxxG motif that is essential for dimerization of the \u03b1IIb TM domain. Using the TOXCAT assay to assess TM domain dimerization, we observed that G972N results in a 55% decrease in TOXCAT activity. This implies that the effect of G972N on the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation state was not a result of increased homo-dimerization of \u03b1IIb, but it is more likely that the mutation disrupted its heteromeric interaction with \u03b23. To test this suggestion, we introduced mutations known to disrupt \u03b1IIb homo-dimerization (G972L, G976A, and G976L) into \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and measured their effect on \u03b1IIb\u03b23 function. Like G972N, each mutation induced constitutive \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation and clustering. Lastly, we measured the effect of L980A, a mutation in the \u03b1IIb TM domain that unlike G972N, results in a 2.5-fold increase in TOXCAT activity. CHO cells expressing L980A constitutively bound ~ 6.5-fold more fibrinogen than did cells expressing WT \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Taken together, our results suggest a mechanism for \u03b1IIb\u03b23 regulation that involves both the heteromeric and homomeric association of the \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 TM domains. Any process that destabilizes the heteromeric association of the \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 TM domains would be expected to allow dissociation of these domains with concomitant \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation. Hence, mutations that disrupt the heteromeric \u03b1IIb/\u03b23 TM domain interface \u201cpush\u201d \u03b1IIb\u03b23 toward activation. Conversely, intermolecular interactions that either require separation of the \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 TM domains or are more favorable when they dissociate, such as homo-oligomerization of the \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 TM domains, will \u201cpull\u201d the equilibrium toward the activated state.",
