    "abstract_text": "Background: Lenalidomide (LEN) is a myelosuppressive immunomodulatory drug that has erythropoietic activity in lower risk MDS patients who failed treatment with rhu-EPO ( N Eng J Med  2005 ; 352 : 549 ). We previously reported that LEN acts to relieve suppression of the EPO-receptor signal in MDS erythroid precursors, suggesting that the erythropoietic activity of LEN might be improved by combined treatment with rhu-EPO. To evaluate the potential benefit of the combination and the relationship between LEN pharmacokinetics (PK) and treatment-related cytopenias, we performed a PK and efficacy study using a two step design. Methods: Eligible patients had transfusion-dependent, Low/Int-1 IPSS MDS and documented prior treatment with rhu-EPO (\u226540,000 U/wk x 6, or darbepoetin equivalent). In the first phase of the study, patients received LEN monotherapy at a dose of 10mg/d [n=25] or 15 mg/d [n=15]. Single dose [n=12] and steady state [n=24] fasting PK were evaluated on days \u22127 and +14, respectively in subjects receiving the 10mg LEN dosage. After 16 weeks of monotherapy, erythroid non-responders (NR) and minor (MiE) responders (IWG 2000) were offered Combined Treatment in which epoetin alpha (EPO) was added at a weekly dose of 40,000 units sc for a minimum of 8 weeks. Bone marrow (BM) aspirate & biopsy were repeated within 72H of the first grade 4 cytopenia nadir. Results: Demographics of the 39 patients treated to date include: median age, 73 years; IPSS categories, Low [n=17] and Int-1 [n=22]; deletion 5q, n=7. Among 33 patients that completed 16 weeks of monotherapy, 11 (33%) were erythroid responders [10 mg, 7/22 (32%); 15 mg, 4/11 (36%)] with 9 major [del(5q), n=6] and 2 MiE. Sixteen patients proceeded to the Combination Phase with 4 (25%) achieving an erythroid response (2 major, 2 MiE) [10 mg, 1/10; 15 mg, 3/6]. PK analyses showed no evidence of drug accumulation after 14 days of treatment. LEN AUC was highest in patients with reduced creatinine clearance (CLcr, 30\u201349 mL/min, n=2: 955\u00b149; vs. CLcr \u226550 mL/min, n=22: 558\u00b1166). There was no significant difference in steady state AUC or Cmax in patients experiencing a \u226550% vs. <50% decrease in ANC or platelet count during the first 28 days of treatment. However, mean AUC inversely correlated with the interval to \u226550% reduction in platelet count (ANOVA, P = 0.04). Neutropenia [overall, 28/39 (72%); 10mg, 20/25 (80); 15mg, 8/14 (57%)] and thrombocytopenia [overall, 23/39 (59%); 10mg, 17/25 (68%); 15mg, 6/14 (43%)] were the most common \u2265grade 3 adverse events (CTC v.3.0), which were accompanied by no significant change in BM cellularity or myeloid:erythroid ratio in non-del5q patients (n=10; P=0.566). Conclusions: Inter-patient variation in systemic LEN exposure is influenced by renal function and may impact interval to development of dose-limiting cytopenias. LEN has erythropoietic activity in primary EPO-non-responders, which may be improved with the addition of EPO. The clinical benefit of the LEN+EPO combination will be investigated in a phase III intergroup study, E2905, in patients who failed primary EPO treatment or have a poor cytokine response profile.",
