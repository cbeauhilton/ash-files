    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3459 Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are an attractive target in treatment of many types of blood cancers. There remains an incomplete understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms driving LSC formation and maintenance, and how this compares to the epigenetic regulation of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). One of the major epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation, is catalyzed by the DNA methyltransferase enzymes Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. We observed decreased expression of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in LSCs isolated from a model of MLL-AF9-induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) compared to normal HSCs. In contrast, expression of Dnmt1 was maintained in LSCs compared to HSCs, suggesting that Dnmt1 may have a critical function in the formation and maintenance of LSCs. Supporting this hypothesis, we found that conditional knockout of Dnmt1 fully ablates the development of AML. Furthermore, haploinsufficiency of Dnmt1 (Dnmt1fl/+ Mx-Cre) was sufficient to delay progression of leukemogenesis and impair LSC self-renewal. Strikingly, haploinsufficiency of Dnmt1 did not functionally alter normal hematopoiesis or HSCs, suggesting an enhanced dependence of LSCs on DNA methylation. Mechanistically, we observed that haploinsufficiency of Dnmt1 in LSCs resulted in derepression of genes that had been silenced by MLL-AF9-mediated transformation and marked by bivalent H3K27me3/H3K4me3 chromatin domains. These results suggest that the formation and maintenance of LSCs depends not only upon activation of a leukemogenic program, but also upon silencing of a specific gene signature that is active in HSCs through crosstalk between two epigenetic mechanisms, polycomb-mediated repression and DNA methylation-mediated repression. This silenced gene signature includes known and candidate tumor suppressor genes as well as genes involved in lineage restriction. These studies present evidence that distinct epigenetic regulatory mechanisms are dominant in LSCs compared to HSCs and provide novel gene candidates for targeted reactivation in AML therapy.
