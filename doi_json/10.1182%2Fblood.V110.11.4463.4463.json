    "abstract_text": "Early stage HL patients (pts) benefit from a short course of chemotherapy combined with IF radiotherapy. In our previous experience six courses of VBM chemotherapy (Stanford regimen) were administered with IF radiotherapy. However, despite good clinical results, the schedule was modified in terms of total chemotherapy cycles delivered, in order to reduce the risk of long term toxicities. PET and CT scan were performed at staging to identify a low risk patients (pts) group. From May 2001 to November 2006, 32 treatment nai\u0308ve Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma pts (18 male, 14 female) were treated with four courses of VBM chemotherapy (D1, 8: Vinblastine 6 mg/sm, Bleomycin 10 mg/sm, Methotrexate 30 mg/sm, repeated every 28 days) followed by IF radiotherapy. Median age was 37 years (range 16\u201373). Main histology was classical HL in 26 pts, while lymphocyte predominant was observed in 6 pts. Pts were all stage I-IIA (no bulky disease), no more than three sites involved, performance status 0\u20131 and ESR < 50. CT scans were performed before and after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. PET scans were performed before and after chemotherapy in 26 pts, and after radiotherapy if not performed before or in case of positivity after chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was usually well tolerated: three pts experienced G3-4 neutropenia while the main non- haematological toxicities recorded were G3 transaminitis in 3 pts and G1-2 neuroconstipation/abdominal pain in 18 pts. IF radiotherapy was performed one month after the last chemotherapy cycle; median dose administered was 30Gy (range 26\u201330.4). At the end of chemotherapy 7 pts were PET positive. While one patient developed progressive disease, the other six pts became negative after radiotherapy and are still in complete remission (CR). 29 pts (90%) completed the whole program obtaining a CR. Two pts progressed before radiotherapy, while one patient shifted to an anthracycline containing schedule after two cycles due to stable disease. With a median follow-up of 42 months (range: 7\u201373), all pts are alive. 1 out of 29 CR pts progressed and is now receiving intensive chemotherapy program with autologous stem cell transplant. In our experience four cycles of VBM chemotherapy combined with IF radiotherapy is an effective program. Furthermore this regimen that doesn\u2019t contain alkylating agents or anthracyclines avoids alopecia and decreases the risk of long term toxicity. PET scan effectively helps to identify low risk early stage HL pts that can take advantage of this therapeutic approach.",
