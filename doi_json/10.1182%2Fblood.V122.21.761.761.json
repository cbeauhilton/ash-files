    "abstract_text": "Introduction Primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL) is a rare form of plasma cell malignancy with poor prognosis (usually less than 12 months survival with conventional chemotherapy). Only one prospective study with Lenalidomide-Dex before high dose therapy has been recently reported 1 . Bortezomib-based regimens and high dose Melphalan/ autologous stem cell transplantation (HDM/ASCT) have shown promising results in small retrospective studies. We report here the first prospective multicenter phase II trial for pPCL patients (pts) treated with Bortezomib-Doxorubicine-Dexamethasone (PAD) / Bortezomib-Cyclosphosphamide-Dexamethasone (VCD) as induction before HDM/ASCT. With the aim to improve response and survival, allograft or second ASCT plus consolidation/maintenance with Lenalidomide-Bortezomib-Dex (VRD) were proposed. Patients and method Non-previously treated pts with a diagnosis of pPCL were enrolled in this phase II study of the IFM group from April 2010 to July 2013. PAD (dexa 40 mg + bortezomib 1,3 mg/m 2 on day 1, 4, 8, 11 + doxorubicine 30 mg/m 2 day 4) and VCD (dexa + bortezomib + cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m 2 day 1, 8) were administrated alternatively each 21 days for 4 cycles. For responding patients with circulating plasma cell < 1%, peripheral stem cells were collected after Cyclophosphamide + G-CSF. Either (i) double HDM/ASCT was performed followed by consolidation/maintenance \u00edVDR (dexa 40mg + bortezomib 1,3 mg/m 2 on day 1, 4, 8, 11 + lenalidomide 15 mg day 1-15) each 3 months and Lenalidomide 15 mg 21/28 days on others months, for 1 year\u00fd or (ii) tandem HDM/ASCT-reduced intensity conditioning-allograft if there were < 66 years-old. Primary end-point was progression free survival (PFS); secondary end-points were responses rates, overall survival (OS), feasibility, and toxicity. We evaluated the disease response to therapy with the IMWG criteria and the percentage of circulating plasma cells; minimal residual disease (MRD) was evaluated during follow-up. Peripheral circulating plasma cells and bone marrow plasmocytes were collected at diagnosis for centralized FISH and SNP array analysis. Results 40 pts were enrolled with a median age of 55y (27-71). Median follow-up was 12.6 months (7.6-24.8). At diagnosis, the median number of circulating plasma cell was 5.2 G/L (1.3-66). Twenty-two percent had creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min, and 11% < 30 ml/min, 44% had an ISS score of 2 and 37% ISS 3. After induction 35 pts are evaluable. In the intent to treat analysis, 25 (72%) responded (VGPR+CR 37%, PR 28%, SD 5%) and 10/35 (28%) were refractory (pts having circulating plasma cell \u2265 1%) and did not continue the study. Twenty-three of the 25 responding pts underwent HDM/auto and 20 pts are evaluable at 3 months: CR+VGPR 14/20 (70%), PR 4/20 (20%), 1/20 (5%) and PD 1/20 (5%). Second HDM/auto was performed in 6 pts and allograft in 12. Ten of the 14 (72%) evaluable pts achieved VGPR or better and 4/14 (28%) PR. Six pts are currently on consolidation/maintenance phase with VRD. Median PFS was 17.8 months. Median OS was not reached. Genomic data are shown in Table I . MDR evaluation will be presented later. Major toxicities were hematological and infections. Eight pts died: 5 during induction, 1 at HDM/ASCT and 2 post allograft while in relapse. Of note, 2 pts had meningeal involvement at relapse.
