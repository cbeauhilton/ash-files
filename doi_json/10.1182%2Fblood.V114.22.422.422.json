    "abstract_text": "Abstract 422 Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by the accumulation of malignant plasmacells into the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment that supports their growth and survival. Particularly, an increase of BM angiogenesis occurs in relationship with plasmacells infiltration playing a critical role in the progression on monoclonal gammopathy. Hypoxia is known to be associated to angiogenesis in solid tumors as well as the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 is a critical trigger and regulator of the angiogenic switch. Actually, the oxygen levels in the BM of patients with monoclonal gammopathy as well the effects of hypoxia and HIF-1\u03b1 on the gene expression and pro-angiogenic profile of CD138 + cells are not known. In this study, first, we investigated the level of BM oxygen saturation (sO 2 ) and partial pressure (pO 2 ) in a cohort of 44 patients with monoclonal gammopathy at the diagnosis including active MM (n\u00b0=25), smoldering MM (n\u00b0 = 8) and MGUS (n\u00b0=11) showing that BM of MM patients was hypoxic (mean \u00b1 SD of pO 2 : 52.5 \u00b1 8.69 mmHg; sO2 of 83.7 \u00b1 11%) even if any significant difference in both pO 2 and sO 2 was not observed in comparison with smoldering MM patients or MGUS as well as in relationship with the stage of disease (p=0.7). Next, we evaluated how hypoxia exposition could modify the gene expression profile of CD138+cells isolated form MM patients by U133 Plus2.0 Arrays. By supervised analysis performed on 11 paired samples we found that hypoxia significantly modulated 714 genes in CD138+ cells isolated from MM patients. Interestingly, genes belonging either to oxidative stress and hypoxia signaling, including heme oxygenase 1 ( HMOX1 ) and the heat shock proteins 90kDa alpha ( HSP90AA1 ; HSP90AB1 ), or to protein ubiquitination pathway, such as XIAP , were significantly up-regulated by hypoxia. Among the pro-angiogenic genes, we found that both VEGFA and IL8 were induced by hypoxia. Following, given that HIF-1\u03b1 accumulates only in hypoxic condition, we checked HIF-1\u03b1 protein expression in the BM of MM patients by immunohistochemistry on bone biopsies immediately after fixation. A strong HIF-1\u03b1 immunostaining was demonstrated in MM cells at nuclear level in all patients analyzed. Interestingly, the presence of HIF-1\u03b1 protein was also observed in isolated CD138 + MM cells of about 28% of MM patients in normoxic condition. In order to investigate the potential role of HIF-1\u03b1 on MM cell gene expression and angiogenic profile we performed HIF-1\u03b1 silencing in MM cells by siRNA anti-HIF-1\u03b1 and that exposed cells to normoxic or hypoxic conditions. HIF-1\u03b1 suppression was associated to the modulation of pro-angiogenic molecules ( VEGFA , VEGFB , IL-8 and PGF ) and oxidative stress ( SOD2 , PTGS2 , TXT ) and glycogenolysis regulating ( ENO2, ALDOC, PFKFB3, HK2, PDK1, PFKFB4 ) genes. Data obtained were than validated by real time PCR and at protein level by western blot and ELISA assay. Consistently we found that HIF-1\u03b1 suppression significantly inhibited the pro-angiogenic properties, evaluated in an in vitro angiogenesis model as capillary junctions and tubules formation and tubule length. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the MM-BM environment is hypoxic and that HIF-1\u03b1 protein expressed by MM cells. Consistently we show that hypoxia and HIF-1\u03b1 significantly modulate the gene expression profiles of MM cells regulating the expression of the pro-angiogenic factors by MM cells and their pro-angiogenic properties.
