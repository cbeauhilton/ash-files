    "abstract_text": "Abstract 164 Background: The achievement of a major molecular remission (MMR) after imatinib therapy in pts with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP) predicts for decreased risk of events, but has little impact in overall survival (OS) among patients with complete cytogenetic response (CCyR). Deeper molecular responses (MR), including undetectable transcripts, are frequently sought in patients with CML treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), but the prognostic significance of these responses is not known. Objectives: To determine the long-term clinical significance of achieving deeper level of MR achieved after therapy with TKI for CML in CP. Methods: Pts were included in clinical trials for initial therapy for CML with one of the following modalities: imatinib 400mg/day (IM400), imatinib 800mg/day (IM800), nilotinib (NILO) and dasatinib (DASA). We defined the level of MR as MMR, MR4, MR4.5 and undetectable transcripts (UND), corresponding to an ABL/BCR-ABL ratio (International Scale) of \u22640.1%, \u22640.01%, \u22640.0032%, and undetectable transcripts (minimum sensitivity 4.5-log), respectively. Results: A total of 495 pts were treated: 83 pts with IM400, 204 with IM800, 106 with NILO and 102 with DASA. At presentation leukocyte counts were higher in the NILO group (41.5 vs 22.2, 27.5 and 27\u00d710 9 /L for IM400, IM800 and DASA pts). All other patient characteristics were equally distributed across the 4 treatment groups. After a median follow-up of 73 months (2 to 142), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) was achieved in 88%. CCyR rates for IM400, IM800, NILO and DASA pts were 82%, 88%, 90% and 90%, respectively. Best level of MR for the entire population was: <MMR in 17% of pts, MMR in 13%, MR4 in 5%, MR4.5 in 19%, UND in 44%. In IM400 pts MR was <MMR in 28% of pts, MMR in 10%, MR4 in 8%, MR4.5 in 14%, UND in 40%. In IM800 pts MR was <MMR in 14% of pts, MMR in 8%, MR4 in 5%, MR4.5 in 19%, UND in 54%. In NILO pts MR was <MMR in 18% of pts, MMR in 20%, MR4 in 7%, MR4.5 in 22%, UND in 33%. In DASA pts MR was <MMR in 18% of pts, MMR in 18%, MR4 in 7%, MR4.5 in 23%, UND in 39%. There was a trend for earlier achievement of MR with NILO: median times to MMR, MR4, MR4.5 and UND were 12, 17.4, 17.9 and 25.1 months, respectively, for IM400 pts; 5.8, 8.7, 11.8 and 23.7 months, respectively, for IM800 pts; 5.7, 7, 8.3 and 16.4 months, respectively, for NILO pts; 5.7, 8.8, 17.4 and 27.2 months, respectively, for DASA pts. To analyze the relationship between the degree of MR and clinical outcome we excluded pts not achieving a CCyR as their best response since the clinical significance of CCyR is well known. For the remaining 438 pts, the depth of molecular remission was inversely correlated with the risk of losing CCyR (19%, 16%, 11%, 7%, 2% in pts with <MMR, MMR, MR4, MR4.5 and UND, respectively) or losing MMR (31%, 42%, 24%, 2%, respectively), as well as the risk of events (22%, 20%, 15%, 12%, 3%, respectively), transformation (3%, 5%, 0%, 1%, 0%, respectively), or death (25%, 11%, 8%, 6%, 4%, respectively). The 6-year OS for pts with <MMR, MMR, MR4, MR4.5 and UND is 74%, 84%, 95%, 96% and 99%, respectively (p<.0001); transformation-free survival (TFS) is 95%, 93%, 100%, 99% and 100%, respectively (p<.014); event-free survival (EFS) is 74%, 74%, 86%, 89% and 99%, respectively (p<.0001). To adjust for the lead-time to achieve deeper responses, we then calculated OS, TFS and EFS rates at 6 years according to the depth of molecular response at 18 or 24 months. Results are summarized in table 1 . Conclusion: Most patients treated with TKI as initial therapy for early CP CML achieve a MR during the course of treatment. BCR-ABL transcripts become undetectable in a significant fraction of them. Achieving a MMR or better at 18 months or 24 months is associated with significantly superior 6-years OS, TFS and EFS. These result suggest that deeper molecular responses (MMR and beyond) are associated with clinical benefit, with a particularly good outcome for those achieving undetectable transcript levels.
