    "abstract_text": "The fixed number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) within a single cord blood (CB) unit has limited the use of CB grafts for allogeneic transplantation in adults. Efforts to promote self-renewal and expansion of HSCs have been met with limited success. Using presently available ex-vivo culture techniques HSCs lose their functional properties in proportion to the number of cellular divisions they have undergone. We hypothesized that chromatin modifying agents, 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5azaD) and histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA) could reactivate pivotal genes required for retaining the functional properties of dividing HSC. We have demonstrated previously that the fate of human bone marrow CD34+ cells could be altered by the addition of 5azaD/TSA ( Milhem et al. Blood.  2004 ; 103 : 4102 ). In our current studies we hypothesized that in vitro exposure of CB CD34+ cells to chromatin modifying agents might lead to optimal HSC expansion to permit transplantation of adults. A 12.5-fold expansion was observed in the 5azaD/TSA treated CD34+CD90+ cell cultures containing SCF, thrombopoietin and FLT3 ligand (cytokines) in comparison to the input cell number. Despite 9 days of culture, 35.4% \u00b1 5.8% (n = 10) of the total cells in the cultures exposed to chromatin modifying agents were CD34+CD90+ as compared to 1.40 % \u00b1 0.32% in the culture containing cytokines alone. The 12.5-fold expansion of CD34+CD90+ cells was associated with a 9.8-fold increase in the numbers of CFU-mix and 11.5-fold expansion of cobblestone area-forming cells (CAFC). The frequency of SCID repopulating cells (SRC) was 1 in 26,537 in primary CB CD34+CD90+ cells but was increased to 1 in 2,745 CD34+CD90+ cells following 9 days of culture in the presence of 5azaD/TSA resulting in a 9.6-fold expansion of the absolute number of SRC. In contrast, the cultures lacking 5azaD/TSA had a net loss of both CFC/CAFC as well as SRC. The expansion of cells maintaining CD34+CD90+ phenotype was not due to the retention of a quiescent population of cells since all of the CD34+CD90+ cells in the culture had undergone cellular division as demonstrated by labeling with a cytoplasmic dye. CD34+CD90+ cells that had undergone 5\u201310 cellular divisions in the presence of 5azaD/TSA but not in the absence still retained the ability to repopulate NOD/SCID mice. 5azaD/TSA treated CD34+CD90+ cells, but not CD34+CD90- cells were responsible for in vivo hematopoietic repopulation of NOD/SCID assay, suggesting a strong association between CD34+CD90+ phenotype and their ability to repopulate NOD/SCID mice. We next assessed the effect of 5azaD/TSA treatment on the expression of HOXB4 , a transcription factor which has been implicated in HSC self-renewal. A significantly higher level of HOXB4 protein was detected by western blot analysis after 9 days of culture in the cells treated with 5azaD/TSA as compared to cells exposed to cytokines alone. The almost 10-fold increase in SRC achieved using the chromatin modifying agents should be sufficient to increase the numbers of engraftable HSC within a single human CB unit so as to permit these expanded grafts to be routinely used for transplanting adult recipients.",
