    "abstract_text": "During development and after transplantation, intravenously injected hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) selectively transmigrate through the sinusoidal walls into the bone marrow (BM) niches to engraft and reconstitute hematopoiesis. The rate of reconstitution following transplantation varies depending on the source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (To , et al 1992). However, the molecular pathways that control the homing of HSCs, in particular, of fetal HSCs are still not well understood. In the present study we studied the contribution of \u03b16 and \u03b14 integrins in homing of fetal liver HSPCs into adult BM by using function-blocking antibodies and an integrin \u03b16 knockout mouse model. We found an ubiquitous expression of both integrin \u03b16 and \u03b14 receptors on fetal liver Lin \u2212 Sca-1 + c-kit + (LSK) HSPCs. Genetic ablation of integrin \u03b16 resulted in reduced homing of fetal liver progenitors (HPCs) to BM of lethally irradiated adult recipients. In agreement with this, the integrin \u03b16 antibody inhibited homing of fetal liver HPCs into BM and spleen. The role of integrin a6 in homing and engraftment of fetal liver HSCs was studied by a competitive repopulation assay by using integrin \u03b16\u2212/\u2212 or \u03b16+/+ fetal liver cells. Absence of \u03b16 integrin in fetal liver cells did not cause any engraftment defect or mobilization hypersensitivity as compared to wild-type cells. In agreement with this, anti-integrin \u03b16 antibody did not either inhibit BM homing of short-term or long-term HSCs. In contrast, homing of fetal liver HSCs and HPCs to BM was virtually abrogated after treatment with integrin \u03b14 antibody. Our results show that the \u03b16 integrin receptors are functional during homing of fetal liver HPCs, but not multilineage repopulating HSC in vivo. Furthermore, we show the critical role of integrin \u03b14 receptor for homing of both fetal liver HPCs and multilineage repopulating HSCs to BM, indicating distinct developmentally regulated functions for integrin \u03b16 and \u03b14 receptors during fetal hematopoiesis",
