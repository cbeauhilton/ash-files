    "abstract_text": "Follicular lymphoma are characterized by the rearrangement of the bcl-2 gene, present in more than 90% of patients. Over-expression of the bcl-2 protein resulting from this translocation is associated with the inability to eradicate the lymphoma, by inhibiting apoptosis. Despite the median survival ranges from 8 to 15 years, leading to the designation of indolent lymphoma, patients with advanced-stage follicular lymphoma are not cured with current therapeutic options. Numerous reports have shown that Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) can induce apoptosis in a wide variety of transformed cell lines of diverse lineage, but does not appear to kill normal cells, even though TRAIL mRNA is expressed at significant levels in most normal tissues. As cell death induced by TRAIL occurs almost exclusively in tumor cells, it suggests that this drug is safe to use as an antitumor therapy. We therefore investigated the efficiency of this cytokine to induce apoptosis in germinal center derived B cell lymphoma, despite bcl-2 over-expression. Our study was also designed to evaluate the role of CD40L, one of the main differentiation signal involved in B cell maturation during the germinal center reaction, on the regulation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. This study was performed on three germinal center derived tumor cell lines (BL2, VAL and RL), and on normal and tumor primary cells obtained from human tonsils and lymph nodes. Our data show that normal B lymphocytes obtained from tonsil biopsies are resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, when B lymphoma cells issued from lymph node of numerous patients are significantly sensitive to the cytokine. When we treat these lymphoma cells with trimeric huCD40L, we partly rescue these cells from spontaneous apoptosis which naturally occurs after few days of culture, and reverse by 50% TRAIL-mediated apoptosis when cells were co-treated with huCD40L for 16 hours. Similar results were reproduced on some germinal center derived cell lines. BL2 was indeed found highly sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis following a 24 hour exposure. On the opposite, VAL and RL were almost insensitive. We have demonstrate that apoptosis is exclusively mediated by TRAIL-R1 in BL2. Analysis of signalling pathways revealed that the protection to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by CD40L is due to some specific anti-apoptotic molecules that will be described. Genes encoding these molecules are targets of the NF\u03baB signalling pathway activated by CD40L. Our results suggest that activation of NF\u03baB and induction of anti-apoptotic molecules by CD40L play an important role in the protection of germinal center derived B cell lymphomas against apoptosis. Then, NF\u03baB inhibitors may be wise to use in clinical trials in conjunction with TRAIL against follicular lymphomas."
