    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1237 Poster Board I-259 Introduction Free light chains (FLC) have prognostic significance in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, solitary plasmocytoma of bone, smouldering myeloma, multiple myeloma, Waldenstroms macroglobulinaemia and AL amyloidosis. Although monoclonal protein secretion is a typical feature of plasma cell dyscrasias, it can also be detected in other B cell malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Recent data suggest a significant correlation between abnormal ratio of FLC and outcome. Therefore, we investigated FLC in a large cohort of 120 patients in order to assess the role of FLC in CLL. Methods and Results Plasma samples which had been previously cryopreserved and collected at the time before the initiation of therapy or six months after finishing therapy were used. The levels of FLC were assessed using nephelometric immunoassays (The Binding Site) and quantified nephelometrically with the BNII analyser. A normal FLC range (\u03bal\u03b3) was defined as 0.26-1.65. Moreover, in all cases we evaluated the M band on immunofixation (IF). Abnormal FLC ratios were found in 71 patients (59%) whereas the IF was positive in only 32 cases (27%). In 48 cases the FLC ratio was positive while IF was negative and in only 9 cases the IF was positive while the FLC ratio was normal. In total, 23 patients had both a positive IF and an abnormal FLC ratio. Patients with an abnormal FLC ratio for \u03b3 had a significantly shorter treatment-free survival (TFS) than patients with an abnormal ratio for \u03ba or with a normal FLC ratio (median TFS: 34 versus 78 versus 109 months, p=0.042). Evaluation of several disease characteristics in association with FLC of the patients' B-CLL cells showed no significant differences for FLC in the different risk groups (ZAP-70 status, CD38 status, cytogenetics and Binet stage) suggesting no correlation of the FLC with these already established adverse prognostic factors. Conclusion FLC can be detected in a substantial fraction of patients with CLL and the FLC technique improves detection of M-proteins. Moreover, an abnormal FLC ratio is associated with worse outcome, particularly those with a low abnormal FLC ratio. Evaluation of the prognostic significance of abnormal FLC in a larger cohort is currently under way. This data will be presented at the meeting. Future studies are warranted to elucidate the role of FLC as biomarkers of disease and as a prognostic factor for response. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
