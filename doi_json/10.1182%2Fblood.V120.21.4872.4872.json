    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4872 Background: ALCL, is clinically/biologically heterogeneous disease, including ALK+ and ALK- systemic forms. Despite the progresses in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of ALCL, the therapy is still based on chemotherapy, thus the identification of new treatment modalities is needed. Bromodomain-containing proteins are components of transcription factors complexes and determinants of epigenetic memory. Inhibitors of BRD2/3/4, members of the Bromodomain and Extraterminal (BET) family, have recently shown antitumor activity in different hematological malignancies models. Here, we report anti-proliferative activity of OTX015, a novel selective orally bioavailable BRD2/3/4 inhibitor, in a panel of ALCL cell lines. Material and Methods: Eight established human cell lines derived from ALK+ and ALK- anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) were treated with increasing doses of OTX015 (OncoEthix SA) and MTT assays were performed after 72h exposure. For cell cycle analysis, cells were treated and stained with Click-iT Edu Flow Cytometry Assay Kits (Invitrogen) and 7-AAD and analyzed for DNA content using a FACScan flow cytometer. Results were analyzed with FlowJo 7.6.3 software. RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNAEasy kit and reverse-transcribed using the Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed on using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System. For senescence detection, cells were stained using a b-Galactosidase Staining Kit (Calbiochem). Results: We assessed OTX-015 anti-proliferative activity in eight ALCL cell lines. The majority (5/8) of the cell lines were sensitive, with IC50 between 36 and 546 nM. There was no apparent difference between ALK+(6) and ALK- (2) cell lines. Cell cycle analyses revealed G1 arrest and a concomitant decrease of the S phase after 24h OTX015 exposure in 4/4 ALCL cell lines, without an increase in cell death, suggesting a cytostatic effect of OTX015. An increase in the percentage of senescent cells after treatment with the BRD-inhibitor was observed in the most sensitive ALK+ALCL cell line. To understand the mechanism of action of OTX015, we assessed MYC mRNA levels before and after treatment. We observed that OTX015 suppressed the transcription of MYC gene and some of its downstream target genes (such as NCL and CAD) in 4/4 ALCL cell lines, with less efficacy in the most resistant one. Conclusion: OTX015 is a new potent BRD-inhibitor with evident anti-proliferative activity in several ALCL cell lines. The down-regulation of MYC gene, followed by cell cycle G1 arrest and increase of cellular senescence, was observed after OTX015 treatment, appearing one of the possible mechanisms of action of the compound. The compound appears worth of further investigation as a new promising therapeutic agent in ALCL and in other mature T-cell tumors. Disclosures: Bonetti: OncoEthix SA: Research Funding.
