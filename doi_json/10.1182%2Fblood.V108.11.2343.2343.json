    "abstract_text": "The vast majority of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cases are characterized by the formation of a PML/RARA fusion gene. Disruptions of retinoic acid receptor \u03b1 (RAR\u03b1) function have also been described in four types of variant APL in which an alternative partner gene ( PLZF , NPM , NUMA , or STAT5B ) is fused to RARA . We describe a novel variant APL with a RARA fusion formed by a complex gene rearrangement which is undetectable by conventional cytogenetics. A 66 yr old male with a history of mild thrombocytopenia was diagnosed with APL based on the blood and marrow morphology, the coagulopathy, and a microspeckled PML immunofluorescence pattern. The bone marrow immunophenotype was negative for CD2, CD19, CD34, CD56, CD117 and HLA-DR, and with weak expression of CD13, CD33 and CD11b, a pattern atypical for APL. The diagnostic bone marrow karyotype was 47,XY,+22[5]/46,XY[30] with no t(15;17)(q22;q21). FISH with the Vysis LSI PML/RARA dual fusion translocation probe did not show any fusion signals but there was splitting of an RARA signal on one 17q. A second probe, the Vysis LSI RARA break apart probe, showed deletion of the 5\u2032 RARA probe and the 3\u2032 RARA probe appeared to localize more distally than normal. The Cytocell PML/RARA ES probe also showed no fusion signals but one RARA signal appeared smaller. The diagnostic marrow was negative for PML/RARA transcripts by RT-PCR using PML and RARA specific primers, but an atypical product was observed. Sequencing of this product showed partial homology to the PRKAR1A gene that maps to 17q24 and encodes the regulatory subunit type I-alpha (RI\u03b1) of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A. RT-PCR using PRKAR1A and RARA specific primers amplified two transcript splice variants of a PRKAR1A/RARA fusion gene. The shorter out-of-frame fusion transcript lacked PRKAR1A exon 3 and encoded a carboxy-truncated RI\u03b1 protein. The longer in-frame fusion transcript resulted from cryptic splicing of the first 100 bases of PRKAR1A exon 3 to RARA exon 3, and encoded a chimeric RI\u03b1-RAR\u03b1 fusion protein that contained the dimerization domain of RI\u03b1 and the same carboxy terminal domains of RAR\u03b1 that are found in all other known RARA rearrangements in APL. FISH using a BAC probe (RP11\u2013120M18) encompassing the PRKAR1A gene identified signals on both copies of 17q; a strong signal on the normal 17 and a weaker signal on der(17). Before cytogenetic, FISH and molecular results were available, the patient was registered on the Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group\u2019s APML4 treatment protocol which includes ATRA, age-adjusted idarubicin and arsenic trioxide. Arsenic was ceased on day 22 due to toxicity. Morphological and cytogenetic FISH complete remission was documented on day 35. A bone marrow biopsy eleven months from original diagnosis showed no evidence of leukemia and PRKAR1A/RARA RT-PCR was indicative of molecular remission. This novel PRKAR1A/RARA gene rearrangement identified in a variant APL is the fifth variant APL in which the RARA partner gene has been identified and the second known rearrangement of PRKAR1A in a malignant disease.",
