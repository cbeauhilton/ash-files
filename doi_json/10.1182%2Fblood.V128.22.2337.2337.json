    "abstract_text": "Background: Observation stays are intended to assess patients for short periods (i.e., <2-midnights) to determine need for inpatient admission or discharge. Unlike rivaroxaban, treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE) with parenteral bridging to warfarin requires frequent coagulation monitoring and dosing adjustments that may prolong length-of-stay (LOS) and increase hospital treatment costs. Objective: To compare LOS, hospital treatment costs, and readmissions in PE patients managed through observation stays treated with either rivaroxaban or parenterally-bridged warfarin. Methods: US Premier Hospital claims data spanning 11/2012-9/2015 was used to identify patients with a primary diagnosis code for PE (415.1x) managed through an observation stay and having \u00b31 claim for a PE-related diagnostic test on day 0-2. Rivaroxaban users, allowing \u00b22 days of prior parenteral therapy, were 1:1 propensity-score matched to patients parenterally bridged to warfarin. LOS, the proportion of encounters lasting >2-midnights, total hospital costs and risk of readmission for venous thromboembolism (VTE) or major bleeding during the same month or 2 months subsequent to the index event were compared between propensity-score-matched treatment cohorts. Results: A total of 401 rivaroxaban patients were matched to 401 patients receiving parenteral bridging to warfarin.Rivaroxaban use was associated with a shorter LOS (-0.25 days), fewer encounters lasting >2 midnights (21.1% vs. 32.7%) and lower total hospital costs (-$240) vs. parenteral bridging to warfarin (p\u00b20.03 for all) (Table) . Readmission was similar between cohorts (p>0.99 for both VTE and major bleeding readmission). Conclusion: Shorter LOS and lower hospital costs occurred with rivaroxaban vs. parenteral bridging to warfarin in PE observation stay patients. This was achieved without increasing short-term risk of VTE or major bleeding readmission.
