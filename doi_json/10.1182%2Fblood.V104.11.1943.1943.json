    "abstract_text": "Through analyses of human factor IX (hFIX) and protein C (hPC) gene expressions in transgenic mice, we recently discovered the first molecular mechanism of age-dimension gene regulation, involving two critical genetic elements ASE and AIE required for age-related stable and increase patterns of gene expression, respectively. The next most critical issue to be tested was whether or not these elements, particularly ASE due to its possible utility, similarly functions with grossly different genes. We constructed hFIX expression vectors carrying a CMV promoter with or without ASE, and tested them in transgenic mice. Vectors with no ASE showed an age-dependent gradual decrease in hFIX expression, reaching the background levels in 3\u20139 months. Vectors with ASE, however, showed age-stable hFIX expression over the same time period. These findings supported the pan-universality of ASE function. As we previously reported, ASE regulates gene expression not only temporally but also spacially. With ASE, CMV-driven expression showed the highest in the heart muscle, whereas without ASE, the highest in the skeletal muscle. These results led to development of the Age Dimension Technology, a new field for exploring the unique applications of the age-related knowledge.",
