    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) may be curative in the treatment of many hematological diseases. However, most patients do not have an HLA- matched sibling donor and an unrelated donor search may be a long process, during which the patients\u2019 disease may relapse or progress. Haploidentical transplants with in vitro T-cell depletion have been used in Pediatrics. However, it requires specialized laboratory infra-structure to manipulate the graft, increases the chances of graft failure and relapse. In vivo T-cell depletion can be achieved with the use of post-transplant cyclophosphamide, as reported by the Johns Hopkins and other groups. The results in adults are very promising and comparable to unrelated double cord blood transplants. Children, however, have not been included in any of the reported protocols. Our objective is to report the institutional experience with five consecutive children who received Haploidentical HSCT with reduced intensity conditioning, T-cell replete grafts and post transplant cyclophosphamide. Methods Children with clear indication to be treated with HSCT and no HLA-matched related or unrelated donor available were offered compassionate haploidentical transplants. Conditioning comprised cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg/day on days -6 and -5, fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days starting on day -6, and 2Gy total body irradiation given in a single fraction on day -1. Bone marrow was harvested from donors and infused into recipients on day 0. The target nucleated cell dose was 5 x10(8) mononuclear marrow cells/kg ( i.e ., peripheral blood count was substracted from the marrow cell count). There was no graft manipulation. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV on days +3 and +4 with 140% Mesna divided on hours 0, 4, 8 and 12 after each dose, Mycophenolate mofetil 15 mg/kg po every 8 hours (maximum 3 g/day) from day +5 to day +35, and tacrolimus from day + 5 to day +180 to keep levels between 5 and 10ng/ml. Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy was started on day +1 and included fluconazole and acyclovir. Results Five children with AML and T-ALL (three in CR2; one induction failure and one 4th relapse) were offered haploidentical transplants as the first HSCT. They had a median age of 10 years (4-16) and weight 41 kg (14-67), 2 girls. One graft was a peripheral blood stem cell collection per physician preference. The median total nucleated cell count was 12x10(8)/kg (10-27) with 10x10(6) CD34/kg (5-15). Mucositis was mild in three patients and none of them had sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. All patients engrafted after a median 14 days (13-17) but one of them, in 4th relapse of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), rejected the graft. Two of four evaluable patients had mild acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), and one mild chronic GVHD. The patient with APL died of two graft rejections on day+125, one T-ALL relapsed on day+180 and three children are disease-free with excellent clinical status one month to 1.7 years after transplant. We conclude that haploidentical HSCT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide is feasible to treat children without an available matched related or unrelated donor and should be prospectively studied.
