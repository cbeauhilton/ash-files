    "abstract_text": "Background: Commercially available recombinant factor VIIa (Novoseven) is widely used in the management of hemophilia patients with inhibitors. Recently several generic versions of recombinant VIIa (rFVIIa) have become available. The generic versions of rFVIIa are claimed to be biosimilar to the barnded Novoseven (Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark). The purpose of this study is to compare the US and European Novoseven products with a generic version of rFVIIa namely, Aryoseven (Aryogen, Tehran, Iran). Methods: Four commercially available random lots of Novoseven were obtained from the US and European sources. Four different batches of Aryoseven were obtained from Aryogen. All individual rFVIIa preparations were diluted to obtain working concentrations of 100, 10, 1 and 0.1 ug/ml. Protein content (Lowry's method), molecular profile using surface enhanced laser desorption ionization (SELDI), gel electrophoretic profile (GEP), factor VII related antigen level (FVII:Ag), factor VII correction studies in depleted plasma and thrombin generation (TG) studies were carried out. In addition, VIIa/tissue factor mediated thrombin generation studies were carried out in various prothrombin complex concentrates such as Beriplex and Prothromplex. Results: The protein content and SELDI mass spectrophotometric profile of all 4 rFVIIa preparations were comparable. There was no differences in the Novoseven obtained from the US and European sources. The GEP of the two groups of agents showed a comparable profile with distinct peaks at 50 KDa and 25 KDa. The FVII related antigen levels were also comparable in the Novoseven and Aryoseven preparations. Supplementation of both the Novoseven and Aryoseven preparations at 10 and 100 ug/ml resulted in a comparable correction of the factor VII deficient plasma as measured by PT(INR). Thrombin generation was comparable in the branded and generic product. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the US and European Aryoseven are comparable. Four batches of Novoseven and 4 individual clinical batches of Aryoseven were found to be comparable. When the US purchased Novoseven preparation was compared with the European Novoseven product, no differences were noted. Thus, the generic Aryoseven is biosimilar to barnded Novoseven and warrant in vivo validation studies. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
