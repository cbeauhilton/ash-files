    "abstract_text": "A novel mouse model of Cooley\u2019s Anemia (CA) has been generated by targeted gene replacement of the adult murine \u03b1-globin genes with human \u03b1-globin and the adult mouse \u03b2-globin genes with a human \u03b3- to \u03b2-globin gene switching cassette containing a \u03b2 0 thalassemic allele. A positive-negative gene replacement construct was designed to simultaneously delete both of the adult mouse \u03b1-globin genes by inserting a 3.8kb human \u03b11-globin gene and a hygromycin marker gene flanked by loxP sites in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. Both adult murine \u03b2-globin genes were deleted by insertion of an Hprt marker gene that was later replaced by a 5.6kb human A \u03b3-globin gene, 4.1kb human \u03b2 0 -globin gene, and a loxP flanked hygromycin marker gene by a \u201ctag and exchange\u201d strategy. The human \u03b2 0 -globin knock-in allele contains a single G to A nucleotide mutation in the first base of intervening sequence 1 [\u03b2 0-IVS1(GtoA) -globin]. This single base change destroys the splice donor site of IVS-1 resulting in the recruitment of several cryptic splice sites. Use of these cryptic splice sites produces a frameshift in the mRNA that results in no functional \u03b2-globin polypeptide synthesis from this allele. This \u03b2 0-IVS1(GtoA) -globin gene mutation is a naturally occurring \u03b2 0 thalassemia allele found in Mediterranean populations. Chimeric mice were generated from both the \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin targeted cells lines. After germline transmission the \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin targeted mice were bred to cre recombinase transgenic mice to remove the marker genes. Heterozygous CA mice exhibit \u03b2 thalassemia intermedia. The \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin targeted mice were interbred to produce animals homozygous for the human \u03b11- and \u03b3\u03b2 0 -globin knock-in alleles. Instead of dying early in fetal life as all current homozygous \u03b2 0 thalassemia mouse models, these novel homozygous CA mice survive solely on high levels of human fetal hemoglobin (\u03b1 2 \u03b3 2 ) throughout fetal development. Newborn homozygous CA mice are blood transfusion dependent similar to \u03b2 thalassemia major infants. This novel model of CA has multiple improvements over existing models of \u03b2 thalassemia. Namely, CA mice express 100% human hemoglobin in their RBCs, mimic the human \u03b3- to \u03b2-globin gene switch, synthesize no functional \u03b2-globin chains after birth, have a single mutant human \u03b2 0 -globin knock-in allele at each \u03b2-globin locus, and are blood transfusion dependent for life after birth.",
