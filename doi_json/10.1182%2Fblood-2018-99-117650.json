    "abstract_text": "Autoantibody-opsonized platelets in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) are thought to be destroyed primarily by macrophage Fc gamma receptor (Fc\u03b3R)-mediated phagocytosis in the spleen. Blockade of splenic macrophage Fc\u03b3Rs has been proposed as a therapeutic mechanism for ITP intervention. Unfortunately, the contribution of specific Fc\u03b3Rs to disease in ITP remains unknown. Our objective was to determine which Fc\u03b3Rs are responsible for the phagocytosis of ITP autoantibody-opsonized platelets by splenic macrophages. Splenic macrophages were purified by CD14 positive selection from spleens of splenectomized ITP patients, and were treated with blocking antibodies to Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIa, Fc\u03b3RIIa/b/c, and Fc\u03b3RIII. Blocking antibodies were deglycosylated to prevent non-specific blocking effects by their Fc region. Two separate ITP sera confirmed positive for anti-GPIIb/IIIa autoantibodies by the monoclonal antibody immobilization of platelet antigens (MAIPA) assay were used to opsonize healthy donor human platelets. Phagocytosis was determined by confocal microscopy and non-phagocytosed (external) platelets were differentiated by an anti-platelet antibody stain following macrophage fixation. Human ITP splenic macrophages were found to express Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIa, Fc\u03b3RIIa/b/c, and Fc\u03b3RIII, and expression was not significantly different compared to healthy (trauma) controls (n=5). The two anti-GPIIb/IIIa-positive ITP sera induced a mean 3.7- and 4.2-fold increase of platelet uptake by ITP splenic macrophages relative to normal human serum controls (n=3 each, p<0.001). Blockade of all Fc\u03b3Rs significantly reduced phagocytosis of serum-opsonized platelets for both ITP sera as compared to an IgG control (p<0.001) down to background (non-opsonized) levels. Using single blocking antibodies, inhibition of Fc\u03b3RI reduced splenic macrophage phagocytosis of platelets by 45% and 37% for the two respective ITP sera as compared to IgG controls (n=3 for each patient sera, p<0.01), while inhibition of Fc\u03b3RIII reduced phagocytosis of platelets by 43% and 44% (n=3 each, p<0.05). Blockade of Fc\u03b3RIIa or Fc\u03b3RIIa/b/c only marginally inhibited splenic macrophage phagocytosis and was not significant. An Fab-like Fc\u03b3RIII-blocking antibody with a mutant Fc region completely deficient for Fc\u03b3R binding demonstrated equal Fc\u03b3RIII blockade compared to the deglycosylated anti-Fc\u03b3RIII antibody. In comparison to ITP sera-opsonized platelets, Fc\u03b3RI had a greater involvement in ITP splenic macrophage phagocytosis of anti-D-opsonized human erythrocytes as Fc\u03b3RI blockade inhibited phagocytosis by 70% (n=5, p<0.001), while Fc\u03b3RIII blockade inhibited phagocytosis by only 30% (p<0.001) and Fc\u03b3RIIa or Fc\u03b3RIIa/b/c blockade had no significant effect. This work demonstrates that Fc\u03b3RI and Fc\u03b3RIII are the primary phagocytic receptors on splenic macrophages for anti-GPIIb/IIIa autoantibody-opsonized platelets in human ITP and suggests that Fc\u03b3RI and Fc\u03b3RIII are the best targets for Fc\u03b3R blockade as a potential therapeutic maneuver in the treatment of ITP.
