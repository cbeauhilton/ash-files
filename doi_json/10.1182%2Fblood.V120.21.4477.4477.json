    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4477 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is one of significant factors contribute to morbidity and mortality in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Prevention and treatment of active CMV infection based on monitoring CMV-pp65 antigenemia test or CMV-DNA PCR assay have been done in this field. As the limitation of insurance, only CMV-pp65 antigenemia test can be clinically carried out in Japan. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), HTLV-1 related hematological malignancy, is known as poor prognostic disease and only allogeneic SCT had been prolonged survival outcomes. ATL cells are morphologically characterized as having complicated nuclei and their surface markers are usually shown as CD3+CD4+CD25+. Some reports suggested that ATL patients have tendency to be in immune compromised status. However, in our knowledge, there was no report about incidence of CMV-replication in ATL patients following allgeneic SCT so far. Here we analyze the incidence of CMV-pp65 antigenemia and related clinical issues in 85 allogeneic SCT recipients of single center located in HTLV-1 endemic area. There were consecutively 97 patients (106 times) undergone allogeneic SCT from November 2006 to May 2012 in Imamura Bun-in Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan. Totally, 12 patients (21 times), 9 times of deaths earlier than 30 days after SCT, 3 times of deaths earlier than engraftment, 9 times of second or more chances of SCTs, were excluded from this study. Rest of 85 (male: 52, female: 33) patients (85 times) were analyzed. We have first picked up patients' clinical data from medical charts including result of CMV-pp65 antigenemia tests and related data. Statistical analysis had carried out using SPSS 11.0J (SPSS Japan Inc., Japan). Cumulative incidences of CMV-pp65 antigenemia were analyzed by Kaplan-Meir method in total 85 patients. Statistical significance defined P=50 and =50 and =50 showed significantly high incidence of incidence of CMV-pp65 antigenemia compared with =50 and <50 (92% vs 91.7%) in ATL recipients. In multivariate analysis, ATL (HR: 2.625, P=0.008) and MAC (HR: 2.532, P=0.014) were positively contributed to incidence of CMV antigenemia by Cox regression analyses. Our study suggests that ATL could be one of independent risk factors of CMV replication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
