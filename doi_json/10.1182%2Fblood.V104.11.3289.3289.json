    "abstract_text": "Ranpirnase (Rap), isolated from frog ( Rana pipiens ) oocytes, is a monomeric ribonuclease (MW 11800) that kills cells by degrading t-RNA upon internalization. Previous studies indicated that the cytotoxicity of Rap could be enhanced more than 10,000-fold when the enzyme is chemically conjugated to an internalizing antibody. Here we describe the construction and characterization of 2L-Rap-hLL1-\u03b34P, composed of two Rap molecules fused to hLL1, an internalizing anti-CD74 humanized monoclonal antibody. To reduce unwanted cytotoxicity, the IgG1 constant region of hLL1 was replaced with an IgG4 that contains a proline mutation in the hinge region. The Rap gene was inserted at the N-terminus of the light chain in the expression vector of hLL1 and expressed in NS0 mouse myeloma cells. The fusion protein was characterized by a variety of techniques, including SE-HPLC, SDS-PAGE, in vitro transcription translation (IVTT) assay using luciferase reporter system, and competition ELISA to measure the binding affinity for CD74. The in vitro potency was determined in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (Daudi) and multiple myeloma (MC/CAR) cell lines by MTS tetrazolium dye reduction assay. In vivo pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of radiolabeled 2L-Rap-hLL1- \u03b34P was compared to radiolabeled hLL1 mAb in nai\u0308ve mice and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of 2L-Rap-hLL1- \u03b34P was determined in a xenograft model of Burkitt\u2019s non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (Daudi). Purified 2L-Rap-hLL1- \u03b34P was shown to be a single peak by SE-HPLC and its MW determined by MALDI-TOF to be 177,150, which is in agreement with the MW of one IgG (150,000) plus two Rap molecules (24,000). Reducing-SDS-PAGE of 2L-Rap-hLL1- \u03b34P revealed the presence of 3 bands, one corresponding to the heavy chain and the other two appearing to be derived from the Rap-fused light chains (38,526 and 36,700 by MS). Occurrence of the 2 light chains was shown to be due to glycosylation of Rap at the N69 residue. The binding affinity of 2L-Rap-hLL1- \u03b34P for CD74 was indistinguishable from that of hLL1. Both 2L-Rap-hLL1- \u03b34P and hLL1 bound to CD74 with subnanomolar affinity. The EC 50 of RNase activity, as measured by the IVTT assay, was 300 pM for 2L-Rap-hLL1- \u03b34P and 30 pM for recombinant Rap (expressed in E. coil ). In in vitro cytotoxicity assays, 2L-Rap-hLL1- \u03b34P was significantly cytotoxic against Daudi (EC 50 280 pM) and the myeloma cell line, MC/CAR (EC 50 50 nM). In contrast, free Rap or naked hLL1 did not demonstrate significant cytotoxicity at the concentrations tested. In vivo , the pharmacokinetic profile of 2L-Rap-hLL1- \u03b34P was almost identical to that of naked hLL1. Both 2L-Rap-hLL1- \u03b34P and hLL1 showed biphasic clearance from the circulation; the \u03b1 and \u03b2 half-life (t 1/2 ) of 2L-Rap-hLL1- \u03b34P were 5 h and 119 h, respectively, and those of hLL1 were 4 h and 125 h, respectively. In tissue biodistribution studies, no significant difference was observed between 2L-Rap-hLL1- \u03b34P and hLL1 with regards to normal tissue uptake. Early efficacy results in the Daudi Burkitt\u2019s non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma xenograft model demonstrate that treatment with a single dose of 2L-Rap-hLL1- \u03b34P as low as 1 \u03bcg/mouse significantly improves survival in comparison to untreated control mice ( P <0.0001)."
