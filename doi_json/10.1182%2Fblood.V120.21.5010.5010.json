    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5010 Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B-cell malignancy that has remained essentially incurable by conventional therapy, highlighting the urgent need for novel treatment strategies. Lenalidomide (LEN) is thalidomide analog belonging to the class of immunomodulatory drugs which the activity are related with immunomodulatory properties. LEN augments both the adaptive and innate immune system via the co-stimulation of T cells, NK and NKT cells. In addition, LEN can inhibit the frequency and function of immunosuppressor cells. Therefore, LEN could be used to enhance immune response against MM. Cellular therapy with dendritic cells (DCs) is emerging as a useful immunotherapeutic modality to treat MM. The purpose of this study was to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of lenalidomide in combination with DCs vaccine to treat MM in vivo mouse model. Methods: We used the MOPC315 myeloma murin model to evaluate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes responses by a DC vaccine in combination with LEN. After tumor growth, LEN (50 mg/kg/day) was injected intraperitoneally at three consecutive days to cover the DC vaccination. The tumor growth inhibition effect and the antitumor activity of splenocytes from vaccinated mice were evaluated to reveal the synergistic effect of DCs and LEN. Results: The combination of LEN and DC vaccine efficiently inhibited tumor growth in mouse MM model when compared to single therapeutic agent. These vaccinated mice exhibit the reduction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cell (T reg ) in spleen. Inhibition of MDSC and T reg resulted in the increasing proportion of CD4 + and CD8 + T cell in the spleen. High ratio of Th1- to Th2-type cytokines was induced by LEN plus DC vaccine. LEN also enhance the innate immune response by modulating NK cell number and function. In addition, LEN also can enhance the population of effector memory T cells in the spleen of vaccinated mice. Furthermore, the treatment of LEN can down-regulate the levels of VEGF and TNF-a on tumor tissues of vaccinated mice. Conclusion: These results suggest that a treatment combining the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide with DC vaccine can improve antitumor immunity in mouse MM model by inhibiting immunosuppressor cells and recovering effector cells, as well as superior polarization of the Th1/Th2 balance in favor of Th1 type immune response.
