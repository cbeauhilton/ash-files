    "abstract_text": "Current treatment of multiple myeloma includes autologous stem cell transplantation. However, it is unknown at the moment what is the extent of graft contamination with clonotypic myeloma cells. In order to evaluate the extent of residual contamination of the graft with myeloma cells, we used our new myeloma cell culture and expansion method developed in the Weizmann Institute of Science for the detection of MRD. We observed readily growing residual myeloma cells in 6 of seven cases, confirmed by clonal markers (FACS, PCR and FISH). However, there was some variability in the pattern of growth; one case of plasma cell leukemia and two cases with t(4;14) showed earlier and more pronounced growth, whereas one case with systemic amyloidosis and another case with MGUS failed to grow in this culture. We are currently arranging a multicenter study for further assessment of these findings and aim to answer the question whether the culture can distinguish between multiple myeloma and other plasma cell dyscrasias. Another goal is to correlate the pattern of in vitro growth of multiple myeloma cells, with clinical and chromosomal characteristics.
