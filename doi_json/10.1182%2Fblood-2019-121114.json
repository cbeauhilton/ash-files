    "abstract_text": "von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a large multimeric plasma glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in hemostasis and thrombosis. VWF recruits platelets at sites of vascular injury by acting as a molecular bridge between circulating platelets and the site of injured or activated blood vessels. Biosynthesis of VWF is restricted to endothelial cells and megakaryocytes. Endothelial VWF is constitutively secreted into plasma and subendothelium, or is stored as \"ultra-large\" (UL)-VWF multimers in endothelial Weibel-Palade bodies. VWF produced in megakaryocytes is packaged as UL-VWF in the a-granules of platelets. VWF stored in endothelial and platelet storage organelles is secreted in a regulated process in response to stimulation by secretagogues. Absence or dysfunction of VWF results in bleeding symptoms, as observed in patients with von Willebrand disease. An abnormally high activity of VWF can lead to thrombotic events. Interestingly, the activity of VWF is determined by the size of its multimers and UL-VWF can spontaneously form platelet aggregates. An important regulator of VWF size is the metalloprotease ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13), which digests large thrombogenic VWF molecules into smaller, less reactive multimers via cleavage of the Y1605-M1606 bond in the VWF A2 domain. ADAMTS13 is mainly synthesized in the liver by hepatic stellate cells, but other sites of synthesis, including renal podocytes, tubular epithelial cell, platelets and endothelial cells, have also been described. ADAMTS13 is released as an active enzyme into the circulation with no physiological inhibitors. Reduced or absent ADAMTS13 activity causes the microangiopathic disorder thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), characterized by VWF and platelet-rich microthrombi that cause multiple organ failure and even death when left untreated. Besides its clear role in the pathophysiology of TTP, the anti-thrombotic and even anti-inflammatory properties of ADAMTS13 have also become apparent in various other thrombotic conditions. High VWF levels and low ADAMTS13 levels are associated with increased risk or even worse outcome of cardiovascular disease, including ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction. Preclinical studies in mouse models showed the beneficial effect of ADAMTS13 in both cerebral and myocardial ischemia/ reperfusion injury by decreasing both thrombosis and inflammation. In addition, ADAMTS13 was shown to also exert a direct thrombolytic effect on VWF-rich thrombi. In a mouse model of ischemic stroke, this thrombolytic activity resulted in efficient lysis of intracranial thrombi that were resistant to standard treatment with tissue plasminogen activator. Hence, ADAMTS13, as a therapeutic agent, could become an interesting avenue, not only to manage TTP, but also to treat other thrombotic complications.
