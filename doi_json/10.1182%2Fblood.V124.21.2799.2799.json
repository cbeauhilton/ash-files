    "abstract_text": "IMPORTANCE: Gastrointestinal bleeding is one of the most common sites of bleeding complicated by anticoagulant therapy. Patients with anticoagulant-associated gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding are at risk of both thromboembolic events after anticoagulant interruption and recurrent bleeding following anticoagulant resumption. OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of thromboembolism, recurrent GI bleeding and mortality for long-term anticoagulated patients who experienced GI bleeding. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL from inception-July 2014, conferences abstracts (January 2006-July 2014) and www.clinicaltrials.gov up to the last week of January 2014 with no language restriction. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently performed study selection, data extraction and study quality assessment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Selected outcomes were thromboembolic events, recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies were included in the qualitative analysis and 2 studies in the quantitative analysis. Thromboembolic events occurred in 92 of 984 patients (9.34%) who resumed warfarin and in 147 of 895 (16.4%) patients who did not. The resumption of warfarin was associated with a significant reduction in thromboembolic event (HR 0.65 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.78], p < 0.001, I 2 =90%) Recurrent GI bleeding occurred in 101 of 954 (10.59%) patients who restarted warfarin and in 40 of 895 (4.47%) patients who did not. There was no statistically significant increase in recurrent GI bleeding for patients who restarted warfarin compared to those who did not (HR 1.19 [95% CI, 0.95 to 1.48], p = 0.13, I 2 = 0%). Death occurred in 203 of 984 (20.63%) patients who resumed warfarin and 316 of 896 (35.27%) patients who did not resume warfarin. Resumption of warfarin was associated with significant reduction in mortality (HR 0.64 [95% CI, 0.54 to 76], p <0.01, I 2 = 75%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE : This meta-analysis demonstrates that resumption of warfarin following interruption due to GI bleeding is associated with a reduction in thromboembolic events and mortality without a significantly increased risk of recurrent GI bleeding.
