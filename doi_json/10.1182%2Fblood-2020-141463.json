    "abstract_text": "Background: There is limited published data on the association between malignancy and the location of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the body. Aims: Assess the location of VTE in the body in patients with active cancer and compare these results in patients without malignancy. Methods: Consecutive patients enrolled in the Mayo Clinic VTE Registry between March 1, 2013 and November 30, 2019 for acute VTE were followed prospectively. Anatomical site of thrombosis and malignancy status were recorded. Patient outcomes were assessed in person, by mailed questionnaire, or by a scripted phone interview. Active cancer was defined as treatment for malignancy within the last six months or not yet in remission. Results: During the study period there were 2,798 patients with acute VTE (1256 with and 1542 without active cancer). Pulmonary emboli were more common in patients with active cancer compared to patients without cancer (49.5% vs. 39.7%, p<0.001). Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (11.4 % vs. 7.7%, p<0.001), renal vein thrombi (1.4% vs. 0.2%, p<0.001) and splanchnic vein thrombi (9.3% vs. 6.0%, p=0.001) were all more common in patients with active cancer compared to patients without cancer. Conclusion: Compared to those without malignancy, patients with active cancer were more likely to have pulmonary emboli, upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, renal vein thrombi, and splanchnic vein thrombi.
