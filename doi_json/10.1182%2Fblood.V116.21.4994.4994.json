    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4994 Background: Bone destruction remains one of the major complications in Multiple Myeloma (MM) leading to morbidity and mortality. African-Americans have a higher incidence of MM but exhibit longer survivals compared to Caucasians. We analyzed bone involvement in a cohort of patients with MM to determine if non African American (non AA) vs. African American (AA) race predicts the presence and severity of bone disease at presentation. Methods: Clinical data was gathered on 197 (176 non AA and 21 AA) MM patients at the University of California, San Francisco. Each patient had a skeletal survey at diagnosis and identified as having 0 lytic lesions, 1\u20132 lytic lesions or 3 or more lytic lesions. The presence of compression fractures was also documented for each patient as was age and sex. Results: The presence of compression fractures strongly correlated with the number of lytic lesions in both the non AA and AA groups, with no compression fractures observed in the patients with zero lytic lesions (p<0.001). Among the AA group, there were fewer (6 of 15) patients with compression fractures compared with patients from the non AA group (92 of 161) (p=0.02). There was also a trend towards fewer lytic lesions among the AA group (p=0.053). No significant difference was observed between the extent of bone disease and age or sex between the two groups. Conclusions: Within this cohort of patients, there is a significantly lower rate of compression fractures among African-Americans. These data supports the idea that African-American patients present with less bone disease which confers a survival advantage compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
