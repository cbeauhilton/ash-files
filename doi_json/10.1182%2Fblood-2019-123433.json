    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The standard first line treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is rituximab (R) plus CHOP (R-CHOP). However, approximately 35-40% of patients (pts) relapse following such treatment, and outcomes with salvage therapy remain poor. Obinutuzumab (GA101; G) is a fully humanized, glycoengineered, type II anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. It has demonstrated greater direct cell death induction and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity/phagocytosis activity than R, and has shown activity and an acceptable safety profile when combined with CHOP (G-CHOP) in first-line treatment of pts with advanced DLBCL (Sharman et al. Leuk Lymphoma 2019). GOYA (NCT01287741) was a randomized, open-label, multicenter Phase III study that compared the efficacy and safety of G-CHOP with R-CHOP in pts with previously untreated DLBCL. In the primary analysis (median observation period: 29 months), G-CHOP did not significantly improve investigator (INV)-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) compared with R-CHOP (Vitolo et al. J Clin Oncol 2017). Here, we present results from the final analysis of GOYA. Methods: Pts were aged \u226518 years, had histologically documented, previously untreated, CD20-positive DLBCL, with adequate hematologic function, \u22651 bi-dimensionally measurable lesion, an ECOG performance status of \u22642, and were classified as being in an International Prognostic Index (IPI) risk group of high, high-intermediate, or low-intermediate risk. Low-risk pts with an IPI score of 1 (not due to age alone) or 0 with bulky disease (1 lesion \u22657.5cm) were also eligible. Pts were randomized (1:1) to 8 (21-day) cycles of G (1000mg i.v. on Days [D]1, 8 and 15, Cycle [C]1 and D1, C2-8) or R (375mg/m 2 i.v. on D1, C1-8) in combination with 6 or 8 cycles of CHOP. Preplanned radiotherapy was allowed for bulky or extranodal disease. The primary endpoint was INV-assessed PFS. Secondary endpoints included independent review committee-assessed PFS (primary analysis only); overall survival (OS); complete response (CR) and overall response rate (ORR) with or without PET (according to modified Cheson 2007 criteria); event-free survival; disease-free survival; duration of response; time to next anti-lymphoma treatment; PFS according to cell of origin (COO; germinal center B cell [GCB] or activated B cell [ABC]), as an exploratory endpoint; and safety. Results: In total, 1418 pts were randomized in GOYA; of these, 704 pts who received G-CHOP and 710 who received R-CHOP were included in this final analysis (clinical cut-off date: January 31, 2018). Overall median follow-up was 47.7 months. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the G-CHOP and R-CHOP arms. INV-assessed PFS was similar between G-CHOP and R-CHOP (5-year PFS, 63.8% vs 62.6%; stratified HR, 0.94; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.12; p=0.48; Table). There was no significant difference in 5-year OS between the G-CHOP and R-CHOP groups (77.0% vs 77.7%) or in CR or ORR (Table). In the subgroup analysis of pts with ABC, GCB and unclassified DLBCL, no significant reductions in risk of disease progression were observed (stratified HR for INV-PFS, 0.91 [95% CI: 0.61, 1.36], 0.80 [95% CI: 0.58, 1.12] and 1.10 [95% CI: 0.65, 1.88], respectively). No new safety signals were identified. Grade \u22653 adverse events (AEs; 75% vs 66%) and serious AEs (44% vs 38%) were more common with G-CHOP than R-CHOP. Grade \u22653 AEs of particular interest (\u22652% of pts in either treatment arm) were more frequent in the G-CHOP arm: infusion-related reactions (10% vs 3%), neutropenia (57% vs 47%), infections (20% vs 16%), cardiac events (5% vs 3%), thrombocytopenia (6% vs 2%), and hemorrhagic events (3% vs 1%); secondary malignancies occurred in 3% and 2% of the R-CHOP and G-CHOP arms, respectively. AEs resulting in treatment withdrawal (12% [87/702] G-CHOP; 8% [58/701] R-CHOP) and AEs with fatal outcome (6% [43/702] G-CHOP; 4% [31/701] R-CHOP) were slightly more common with G-CHOP. The most common grade 5 AEs were pneumonia (n=5 both arms) and sepsis/septic shock (G-CHOP, n=7; R-CHOP, n=3). Conclusions: Consistent with the primary analysis, G-CHOP did not significantly improve INV-assessed PFS compared with R-CHOP in previously untreated pts with DLBCL. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in 5-year OS between the treatment arms. No unexpected safety signals were identified. Further investigation of outcomes is ongoing, including the prognostic value of COO and BCL2 positivity. View large Download slide View large Download slide  Disclosures Sehn: F.
