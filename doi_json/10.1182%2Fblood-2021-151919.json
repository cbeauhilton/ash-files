    "abstract_text": "Reticular Dysgenesis (RD) is a particularly grave form of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), characterized by maturation arrest of both myeloid and lymphoid lineages paired with sensorineural hearing loss. RD is caused by biallelic mutations in the mitochondrial enzyme adenylate kinase 2 (AK2). AK2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 AK2 biallelic knock out model in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), we have shown that AK2 -/- HSPCs mimic the neutrophil maturation defect in RD patients. Mitochondrial respiration is compromised in AK2 -/- HSPCs, which leads to a decreased NAD + /NADH ratio resulting in reductive stress. Metabolomics analysis by LC-MS/MS showed a significant accumulation of AMP, along with increased AMP/ADP and AMP/ATP ratios in AK2 -/- HSPCs, suggesting that purine metabolism is compromised by AK2 deficiency. Purine metabolism defects, such as deficiencies in adenosine deaminase (ADA) and purine nucleotide phosphorylase (PNP), have long been recognized as a cause of SCID. Furthermore, pharmacological interference with purine metabolism is a highly effective antiproliferative strategy in cancer therapy. In this study, we sought to investigate whether impaired purine metabolism contributes to the myelopoietic defect caused by AK2 deficiency. Results We explored how purine metabolism affects myelopoiesis by differentiating HSPCs in media containing no nucleosides (nucleoside-), mixed nucleosides (nucleoside+) or adenosine only (adenosine+). We observed no difference in proliferation or neutrophil maturation between nucleosides- and nucleoside+ media for both control and AK2 -/- HSPCs, suggesting that AK2 -/- HSPCs do not rely on exogenous nucleosides. Interestingly, control HSPCs cultured in adenosine+ media showed severe proliferation and neutrophil maturation defects that mimic AK2 deficiency, suggesting that purine imbalance is detrimental to myelopoiesis. Previous metabolomics analysis showed a significant accumulation of inosine monophosphate (IMP) in AK2 -/- HSPCs. Since IMP can be produced through AMP deamination by AMPD, we asked whether the IMP accumulation in AK2 -/- HSPCs is caused by converting excess AMP to IMP. An LC-MS/MS analysis showed that AMPD inhibitor (AMPDi) treatment significantly lowered IMP levels and increased AMP levels in AK2 -/- HSPCs, indicating that AMP deamination is a major source of IMP accumulation in AK2 -/- HSPCs. Furthermore, AMPDi treatment did not improve, but rather slightly aggravated neutrophil differentiation in AK2 -/- HSPCs, suggesting that the AK2 -/- neutrophil maturation defect is not caused by IMP accumulation. This raises the possibility that AK2 -/- HSPCs employ AMP deamination as a mechanism to curtail the toxicity of excess AMP. Since purine is a building block of RNA, and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) constitutes >85% of cellular RNA content, we asked whether rRNA synthesis is compromised by AK2 deficiency. Pyronin Y staining showed a significant decrease in rRNA content in AK2 -/- HSPCs. Nascent peptide synthesis rate was also decreased in AK2 -/- HSPCs, as quantified by OP-puromycin uptake. These findings are corroborated by RNA-seq analysis of AK2 -/- and control HSPCs, which showed that ribosomal subunits, ribosomal biogenesis and ribonucleoprotein complex assembly are among the top down-regulated pathways. The data suggest that defective purine metabolism in AK2 -/- HSPCs impairs ribosomal biogenesis and protein synthesis. Conclusion Our studies showed that purine imbalance in HSPCs impairs myeloid proliferation and neutrophil maturation. AK2 depletion in HSPCs leads to AMP accumulation and defective ribosomal biogenesis. AK2 -/- HSPCs convert excess AMP to IMP, possibly as a means to mitigate AMP toxicity. However, AMP deamination activities alone are not sufficient to lower AMP levels to those of control HSPCs. We are currently testing whether boosting 5'-nucleotidase activities (cNIA, cN1B and cNII) in AK2 -/- HSPCs can decrease AMP levels and rescue the neutrophil maturation defect. As purine metabolic defects are associated with diverse immune and non-immune abnormalities, further understanding of how purine metabolism governs differentiation of human HSPCs will enable us to develop novel therapeutic strategies for RD and other purine disorders.
