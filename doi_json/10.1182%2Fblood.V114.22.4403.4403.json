    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4403 Members of the TNF/TNF receptor (TNFR) family of proteins govern differentiation, proliferation, activation, and death of both tumor and immune effector cells and thus play an important role in tumor immunoediting, the reciprocal interaction of tumor cells and anti-tumor immunity. Activation of the TNFR family member GITR has recently been shown to stimulate T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity in mice. However, available data suggest that GITR mediates different effects in mice and men, and may impair anti-tumor immunity of human NK cells. Here we studied the expression and function of GITR ligand (GITRL) in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and the consequences of GITR-GITRL interaction for NK cell reactivity against CLL cells. Substantial GITRL expression was detected on primary B-CLL cells in 38 of 48 (79%) investigated patients. Upon interaction with its cognate receptor, GITRL induced the release of immunoregulatory cytokines like TNF by the leukemia cells, which demonstrated that CLL-expressed GITRL is functional and capable to transduce bidirectional signals. Moreover, disruption of GITR-GITRL interaction in cultures of allogenic NK cells with patient CLL cells by addition of blocking antibody caused a significant increase in NK cell granule mobilization, cytotoxicity and IFN-\u03b3 production. The inhibitory effect of tumor-expressed GITRL on the reactivity of human NK cells was also confirmed in cocultures of C1R lymphoma cells transfected to express GITRL with mock transfectants serving as control. In addition, blocking GITR-GITRL interaction also considerably augmented both antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-induced IFN-\u03b3 production of NK cells in cultures with allogenic CLL cells upon Rituximab exposure. Of note, GITR blockade also significantly enhanced anti-leukemia reactivity of autologous NK cells among PBMC of B-CLL patients, and this reinforcement of NK cell effector functions was observed both regarding the direct and, more pronounced, Rituximab-induced anti-leukemia reactivity (both n=10, p<0.01, Student's T test). Thus, expression of functional GITRL by CLL cells potently influences tumor immunoediting and impairs anti-tumor immunity by diminishing both direct and Rituximab-dependent anti-leukemia reactivity of NK cells. Modulation of the GITR-GITRL system might therefore serve to enhance the efficacy of therapeutic approaches in CLL which, like Rituximab-induced ADCC or stem cell transplantation, rely on a sufficient NK cell anti-tumor response.
