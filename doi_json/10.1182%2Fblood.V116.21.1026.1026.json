    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1026 Despite numerous advances in the past few decades, treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL) remains a common and considerable challenge. Further efforts to define the molecular lesions that drive ALL are needed to improve clinical management. The Hox subfamily of T-cell ALL (T-ALL) represents 30\u201340% of pediatric and adult cases. TLX1/HOX11 is the prototypical member of the Hox group. To generate a resource for developing targeted therapies for Hox T-ALLs, we developed a doxycycline-regulated mouse model of Tlx1-initiated T-ALL. Dysregulated thymic expression of Tlx1 induces T-ALL after \u223c5-7 months with penetrance of 15\u201360%. The lymphoblasts are arrested at the early CD4 + /CD8 + /CD24 hi stage of T-cell development, similar to human T-ALLs of the TLX1 subtype. Spontaneous activation of the Notch1 oncogene occurred in the tumors. In about two-thirds of samples, Notch was activated through acquired mutations in the heterodimerization and PEST domains that resemble the Notch1 mutations found in human patients. Inhibition of Notch signaling with g-secretase inhibitors completely abrogated cell line growth and induced apoptosis. Notch inhibition also transiently delayed leukemia progression by \u223c17 days in vivo. In contrast, suppression of Tlx1 expression had more moderate inhibitory effects on cell line growth in vitro. However, suppression of Tlx1 expression in transgenic mice transiently delayed leukemia progression by \u223c11 days. Tlx1 suppression had the strongest inhibitory effects on expression of CCR7 and lymph node size. These effects were fully reversed with ectopic expression of Tlx1. These data show that Tlx1 can convert normal thymocytes into leukemia cells, but the leukemia cells are not fully dependent on continued Tlx1 expression. The leukemia cells recruit secondary factors and pathways such as Notch and c-Myc to sustain growth and survival. Our study highlights a strong resiliency of T-ALL cells to both Tlx1 and Notch inhibition. Our study has important implications for targeting these pathways for the treatment of T-ALL.
