    "abstract_text": "Dominant cardiac involvement by primary systemic amyloidosis (AL) precludes effective AL treatment and is associated with short survival. Between January 2009 and June 2015, total of 9 patients who presented with severe cardiac dysfunction as their major manifestation of AL underwent orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). Four of these 9 patients were able to complete the planned second phase of treatment with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) 13-16 months after OHT. Diagnosis of cardiac AL was established via endomyocardial biopsy, Congo red staining and immunohistochemistry. All patients had end stage heart failure and developed cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump support (median 20 days, range 10-165) as a bridge to OHT. The median age at AL presentation was 54 years (42-65) in 4 females and 5 males. At median follow-up of 30 months (1-54) from OHT, 6 (66 %) patients are alive (table-1). Two patients died of post-operative complications at 1 and 7 months post OHT; a 3 rd patient died 36 months after OHT (23 months post ASCT) of AL progression. Four patients received ASCT at median of 13 months (13-16) after OHT. In the remaining 3 patients ASCT was not feasible due; to low DLCO; recently treated disseminated Cryptococcus; or prior ASCT. All 4 patients with ASCT were on tacrolimus and prednisone at the time of stem cell mobilization and hematopoietic transplant; two patients were also receiving mycophenolate mofetil and valganciclovir. We collected 5.7, 6.1 and 6.2 x 10 6 /kg CD-34 + cells in 2 days after filgrastim administration (5 ug/kg, twice, daily) and plerixafor (16 mg/kg based on day- 4 CD-34 + counts) in 3 subjects. The fourth patient initially failed to mobilize but 4.3x10 6 /kg CD-34 + cells were subsequently obtained after stopping mycophenolate mofetil for 4 weeks. The creatinine clearance at the time of the high-dose chemotherapy given prior to ASCT was 36, 30, 41 and 43 ml/minute. All 4 patients received a renal adjusted dose of melphalan at 140mg/m 2 . Mycophenolate mofetil and valganciclovir were withheld during neutropenia until engraftment. No patients received post-transplant filgrastim. Patients were hospitalized for 17, 18, 18 and 20 days. Renal function remained stable during ASCT and non-hematological toxicity was limited to grade I-II apart from one grade III oral mucositis and colitis. Two patients achieved hematologic complete remission (patient2&4) while 2 patients had a partial response following ASCT. Post OHT and ASCT 3 patients are alive and well at follow-up of 54, 37 and 52 months. The strategy of OHT followed by ASCT is therefore feasible in select patients with dominant cardiac involvement and advanced heart failure Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
