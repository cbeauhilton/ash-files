Prophylaxis reduces the risk of VTE by 60% but many patients do not receive risk-appropriate VTE prophylaxis. We developed mandatory computer decision support \u201csmart ordersets\u201d (i.e. electronic menus with DVT prophylaxis recommendations) to improve our institution's VTE prophylaxis performance. The ordersets require providers to respond to 2 questions that assess VTE risk factors and contraindications to pharmacologic prophylaxis. Using these answers along with known patient demographics, the orderset gives providers an evidence-based risk-appropriate VTE prophylaxis recommendation. Methods: To study the impact of Medicine service-specific orderset on compliance with the 2008 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) VTE prophylaxis guideline and clinical outcomes, we conducted a retrospective cohort chart review of consecutive patients admitted to the Medicine service during one month immediately prior to (November 2007) and a single month subsequent to (April 2010) orderset launch. Data collection included patient demographics, VTE risk factors, and use and type of VTE prophylaxis. Patient characteristics before and after implementation of the protocol were compared. The primary outcome measures were compliance with thromboprophylaxis guidelines in patients at risk for VTE and the 90-day VTE rate. Secondary outcomes were bleeding events and 30-day mortality. Outcomes were compared by Student's t-test and Fisher's exact test. Results: The before and after cohorts contained 1,025 and 1,057 patients, respectively. Demographic characteristics and contraindications to pharmacologic prophylaxis were similar between groups. ( Table 1 ) Some VTE risk factors were more prevalent in the before group. ( Table 1 ) ACCP compliant prophylaxis increased significantly from 68.3% to 85.9% (p <.0001). Provider choices for prophylaxis changed with an increase in mechanical prophylaxis and twice daily heparin in the post-orderset implementation cohort. ( Table 2 ) Radiographically-documented symptomatic VTE by day 90 post-hospital discharge declined from 2.8% to 0.7% after orderset implementation (p=0.001). There was also a trend toward fewer in-hospital VTE (0.8% versus 0.2%, p=0.06). (Figure 1) Major bleeding remained unchanged (0.3% to 0.1%, p=0.47). Table 1.
