    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2507 Poster Board II-484 Although the etiology of anemia remains unexplained in one third of elderly subjects, increasing evidence implicates chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of anemia in the elderly population. We hypothesize that in addition to classical anemia of inflammation (AI) mediated by hepcidin, a significant proportion of unexplained anemia involves the overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines like TNF\u03b1 that promote direct suppression of erythroid progenitors to a degree more prominent than the effects of hepcidin, resulting in the development of unexplained anemia marked by absence of the expected biochemical profile of AI. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of anemia subtypes is necessary if we are to develop effective targeted, oral therapies for patients. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate whether resveratrol, a flavanol found in high concentration in red wine that appears to possess potent anti-inflammatory properties, ameliorates TNF\u03b1-mediated erythroid colony suppression in human CD34+ cells. Human peripheral blood CD34+ cells from 3 healthy adults were first cultured in methylcellulose medium in the presence of IL-3 (10ng/ml), EPO (1U/ml), SCF (50ng/ml) and increasing doses of TNF\u03b1 (0-100ng/ml) and erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) measured on day 14. Consistent with prior experiments, the percentage of BFU-E colonies was reduced by 60% at day 14 in the presence of 25 and 100ng/ml TNF\u03b1 (p < 0.01, t-test), which was reversed to baseline with the addition of the neutralizing anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody infliximab (p < 0.01, t-test). In order to determine whether the addition of resveratrol moderated TNF\u03b1-mediated erythroid colony suppression, human CD34+ cells were initially pre-incubated with increasing doses of resveratrol (0-50\u03bcM) for 72 hours and cultured in methylcellulose medium containing IL-3 (10ng/ml), EPO (1U/ml), and SCF (50ng/ml) in the presence or absence of 25ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and varying concentrations of resveratrol (0-50\u03bcM) and BFU-E measured on day 14. We noted 50% recovery in BFU-E colony numbers at day 14 in CD34+ cells grown in the presence of 10\u03bcM resveratrol and TNF\u03b1 in comparison with TNF\u03b1 alone (p < 0.02, t-test). To better characterize TNF\u03b1-mediated pathways influenced by resveratrol, we analyzed in parallel CD34+ cells pre-incubated for 72 hours with 10\u03bcM resveratrol and grown in serum-free liquid culture containing similar concentrations of IL-3, SCF, and EPO in the presence or absence of 25ng/ml of TNF\u03b1 and 10\u03bcM resveratrol. Total RNA and protein were isolated at multiple timepoints after the addition of TNF\u03b1 on culture day 4 and TNF\u03b1-mediated gene and protein expression as well as hematopoietic microRNAs miR155 and miR451 expression analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and/or Western blot. We found that TNF\u03b1-treated CD34+ cells exhibited a 5-fold increased expression of miR155 without change in miR451 expression at 12 hours post TNF\u03b1 treatment compared with control cells. However, CD34+ cells cultured in the presence of 10\u03bcM resveratrol and TNF\u03b1 revealed downregulation of miR155 expression to baseline levels without change in miR451 expression (p < 0.01, t-test). Resveratrol treatment also resulted in 2-fold increased expression of GATA-1 without an appreciable change in GATA-2 (p < 0.01). Western analysis of whole cell lysates using antibodies recognizing known TNF\u03b1-associated signaling pathways revealed robust increases in phospho-p38MAPK, phospho-JNK, and phospho-ERK 1/2 in response to TNF\u03b1 stimulation compared with control, with no inhibition of these signaling pathways noted in response to resveratrol treatment. We next examined TNF\u03b1-mediated NF-\u03baB signaling in the presence or absence of resveratrol by Western analysis and found that the addition of resveratrol resulted in a 50% reduction in phospho-NF-\u03baB levels in response to TNF\u03b1, with total NF-\u03baB levels unchanged in all conditions. These data indicate that resveratrol significantly ameliorates TNF\u03b1-mediated erythroid colony suppression in human CD34+ cells via novel mechanisms that incorporate downregulation of both miR155 and NF-\u03baB-associated signaling pathways, providing important evidence that resveratrol may be a potentially effective agent in the treatment of TNF\u03b1-mediated anemia and inflammation.
