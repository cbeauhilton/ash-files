    "abstract_text": "Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic diseases characterized by impaired hematopoiesis and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although rare, several monogenic causes of familial MDS/AML have recently been molecularly defined. We studied two families with variable manifestation of cytopenia, MDS with cytogenetic aberrations involving chromosome 7, immunodeficiency, and neurologic disease consistent with ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome. Genetic studies uncovered heterozygous missense variants (p.Arg986Cys and p.Ile891Thr) in SAMD9L , a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 7. Consistent with a gain-of-function effect, transfection and over-expression of both SAMD9L variants decreased cell proliferation relative to wild-type protein. In the two families, a total of 10 individuals heterozygous for either SAMD9L mutation were identified. Three individuals developed MDS, with monosomy 7 or der(1;7)(q10;p10) as cytogenetic aberrations that encompassed the mutant SAMD9L locus. In an additional five individuals, three of which experienced a spontaneously resolved cytopenic episodes in infancy, we detected mosaic copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity of 7q by uniparental disomy, with loss of the mutated allele, or mosaic cis SAMD9L mutations. By digital PCR, we identified these events in hematopoietic progenitor cell populations, which were further enriched in B and NK cell lineages. Absent in non hematological tissues, these mutations thus represented somatic revertant mosaicism. Clinically, revertant mosaicism was associated with reduced disease severity, although in two individuals neurological manifestations persisted. Of note, two unaffected carriers without revertant mosaicism harbored an additional rare in trans germline SAMD9L p.Thr233Asn missense variant. In cellular assays, the SAMD9L p.Thr233Asn variant increased proliferation, indicating a loss-of-function effect that potentially compensates for the SAMD9L p.Arg986Cys mutation. Together, our results demonstrate that gain-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor SAMD9L cause a disease with cytopenia, immunodeficiency, variable neurological presentation, and predisposition to MDS with chromosome 7 aberrations, where hematopoietic revertant mosaicism is common and ameliorates the clinical presentation.
