    "abstract_text": "Despite new conditioning regimens and introduction of novel immunosuppressants in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) remains an often life threatening complication. Methylprednisolone (MP) 2 mg/kg body weight (BW) per day is the initial standard treatment with escalation to high-dose MP (10 mg/kg BW per day) for non-responders. Recently, we demonstrated OKT3 muromonab to be an effective second-line and subsequent salvage treatment. Response duration, however, was frequently short-lived in those extensively pretreated patients and inversely correlated with duration from allografting. In the current randomized multicenter trial we investigated high-dose MP (HD-MP) versus OKT3 5 mg per day plus HD-MP. Primary endpoints were response to treatment after 100 days and survival at one year from HCT. Secondary endpoints were side effects and incidence of infectious complications. Patients with resistant \u00b0II to IV aGvHD on standard MP following allogeneic HCT were randomized to HD-MP or OKT3 + HD-MP after exclusion of other severe HCT-related complications. Eighty patients from 6 transplant centers were enrolled. Median age for the 40 patients who received OKT3 + HD-MP was 40 (range, 19 \u2013 65) years and for the 40 patients who received HD-MP 39 (range, 19 \u2013 56) years. There was no statistical significant difference between the groups for severity of aGvHD (\u00b0II vs. \u00b0III/IV); stem cell source (bone marrow vs. peripheral blood progenitor cells); GvHD prophylaxis (CSA vs. ATG+CSA); and conditioning regimen (TBI/Cy vs. Bu-Cy). However, significantly fewer HCTs in the OKT3 + HD-MP group were from HLA-identical siblings. Currently, 62 subjects are evaluable for response. In both arms, reduction of severe and proportional increase of moderately-severe aGvHD was observed with resolution of all \u00b0IV cases until day +30. However, significantly more patients in the OKT3 + HD-MP became disease-free (\u00b00) by day +100 when compared to patients treated with HD-MP alone: 39.3 % vs. 20.6 % (p=0.03). In the OKT3 + HD-MP group relative increase of disease-free patients was higher for all organ systems at all time points when compared to patients on HD-MP treatment without reaching statistical. With respect to infectious complications, the incidence of both bacterial and viral infections was slightly and for invasive aspergillosis significantly higher in the HD-MP when compared to the OKT3 + HD-MP group (20.6 vs. 10.7 %; p=0.025). Treatment related mortality was higher in the HD-MP group when compared to the OKT3 + HD-MP group by days +30 (32.3 vs. 10.7 %) and +100 (55. 9 vs. 39.3 %). However, this did not translate into a significantly better one-year survival with the currently evaluable patients: one-year survival for the HD-MP group was 32.4 % and for the OKT3 + HD-MP group 46.4 %. (p=0.72). We conclude that OKT3 + HD-MP results in higher response rates for patients with steroid-resistant aGvHD and thus leads to a better immune reconstitution after HCT what is reflected by reduced incidence and mortality of infectious complications. Final results of the trial will be presented.",
