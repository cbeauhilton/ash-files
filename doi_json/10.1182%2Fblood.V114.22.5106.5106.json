    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5106 Background Heart failure secondary to myocardial siderosis remains the main cause of death in regularly transfused patients with \u03b2-thalassemia. Once-daily oral iron chelation therapy with deferasirox (Exjade \u00ae ) has been shown to reduce body iron burden in patients with transfusion-dependent anemias, and the removal of myocardial iron has been demonstrated in several clinical studies including the prospective, multicenter EPIC study. Here we report for the first time an evaluation of right ventricular (RV) function assessed using magnetic resonance (MR) techniques in \u03b2-thalassemia patients with myocardial siderosis treated with deferasirox in the EPIC study. Methods The cardiac sub-study of EPIC enrolled patients with \u03b2-thalassemia aged \u226510 yrs who had MR myocardial T2* >5\u20132500 ng/mL, MR (R2) liver iron concentration (LIC) of >10 mg Fe/g dry weight (dw), and a lifetime minimum of 50 transfused blood units. Deferasirox was initiated at 30 mg/kg/day and subsequent dose adjustments of 5\u201310 mg/kg/day were based on changes in SF, month-6 cardiac T2* and safety parameters. The following RV parameters were assessed using MR; ejection fraction (RVEF), volumes (end-systolic [RVESV] and end-diastolic [RVEDV]) and mass (RVM). All parameters were assessed at the CMR core laboratory in London, UK after 6 and 12 months of deferasirox treatment. Results 114 patients were enrolled in the cardiac sub-study (54 male, 60 female; mean age 20.9 \u00b1 7.3 years). Baseline myocardial T2* was <10 ms in 47 (41%), and 10\u201320 ms in 67 (59%) patients. Mean baseline LIC was 28.2 \u00b1 10.0 mg Fe/g dw, median serum ferritin was 5235 ng/mL, and the mean amount of transfused blood in the previous year was 185 mL/kg. 68% of patients had received prior deferoxamine (DFO) and 32% DFO/deferiprone combination chelation therapy. Mean actual deferasirox dose over 12 months was 32.6 mg/kg/day. RVEF increased significantly from a mean \u00b1 SD baseline of 65.8 \u00b1 6.2% to 67.6 \u00b1 6.4% at 6 months ( P =0.013) and 68.7 \u00b1 5.7% at 12 months ( P <0.0001; Figure ). RVESV significantly decreased from 35.0 \u00b1 14.5 mL at baseline, to 33.4 \u00b1 12.8 mL ( P =0.034; Figure ) by 12 months and RVEDV significantly increased from 101.0 \u00b1 31.8 mL at baseline to 105.7 \u00b1 33.4 mL ( P =0.04; Figure ) by 12 months. There were no significant correlations between any of the RV function parameters assessed and T2*. There was a borderline significant reduction in RVM from 46.8 \u00b1 14.6 g at baseline to 44.9 \u00b1 12.4 g at 12 months ( P =0.088). Reference RVEF, RVESV, RVEDV and RVM have been defined in healthy subjects as 66 \u00b1 6 %, 50 \u00b1 14 mL, 144 \u00b1 23 mL and 48 \u00b1 12 g, respectively (A M Maceira et al. Eur Heart J 2006;27:2879\u201388), although values were shown to vary significantly by gender, body surface area and age.

The RVEF improved with increased RVEDV and decreased RVESV, which is suggestive of improved RV and left ventricular compliance respectively resulting from removal of myocardial iron. However, improvements in pulmonary vascular resistance may also play a role. Disclosures Smith: Novartis Pharma AG: Consultancy, Employment at Royal Brompton Hospital funded by Novartis Pharma AG.
