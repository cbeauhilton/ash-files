    "abstract_text": "Introduction: As people with HIV live longer, the epidemiology of plasma cell disorders (PCD) including MGUS, smoldering myeloma and Multiple myeloma (MM) becomes relevant and remains unknown. Moreover, patients with HIV have a higher incidence of monoclonal proteins which may not be related to an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder[1, 2] . There are mostly anecdotal reports and very few studies in HIV myeloma[3]. A retrospective study of 10 patients with HIV+ve symptomatic MM reported possible therapeutic benefit of ART and reported better overall survival of HIV+ve MM on ART as compared to HIV -ve MM. There is a paucity of data in PCD in this population whose incidence can be expected to increase globally. We conducted a single-institution retrospective study to look at the incidence of PCD. Methodology:We reviewed an electronic database of patients with HIV related PCD treated at Montefiore Medical Center between 2001 and 2018. All patients with a new diagnosis of PCD between January 1 2001 to July 15 2018 were identified. Data on patient demographics, HIV status, clinical outcomes (including mortality) and therapy was collected. Results: Between 2001 and 2018, 14438 patients were identified with HIV and 1986 patients had a monoclonal band in SPEP (13.8%). Based on our previous study, patients who had a definitive monoclonal band or suspected MM underwent a BM biopsy. 34 patients were diagnosed with PCD --MGUS 16 (47.05%), Smoldering MM 1 (2.94%), MM 16 (47.05%) and Primary plasma cell leukemia (PCL) 1 (2.94%). The majority of the patients were AA consistent with demographics of the Bronx. Interestingly HCV co-infection was identified in 50% (n=17) of patients and HBV co-infection was present in 15% (n=5) patients. The median CD4 count was 381 (12-1080), median viral load 237 (0-501534) and 53% patients were on ART at the time of diagnosis. The median time from HIV diagnosis was 13.9 (-2.8 to 29) years. In patients with MGUS the predominant heavy chain involvement was IgG, the median protein on SPEP was 1.1 g (0.7-1.9 g) and percentage of BM involvement was 5% (2-10%). In patients with MM IgG was the predominant heavy chain involved. On presentation, ISS Stage was Stage I in 2 patients (15.4%), 4 (30.7%) had at least Stage 2, 7 patients (53.9%) had stage 3. On presentation, 10 (58.8%) patients presented with anemia, 10 (58.8%) presented with renal impairment (Cr>=1.3), 16 (94.1%) presented with bone lesions, 6 (37.5%) presented with hypercalcemia. 5 patients (34.6%) had extramedullary presentation including 1 patient (2.9%) with PCL, 2 (5.8%) with anaplastic plasmacytoma. All patients were treated with an imid or bortezomib based regimen and there were no unusual side effects in these patients. 5 patients (29.4%) underwent autologous stem cell transplant with successful outcomes. Discussion: The prevalence of a positive SPEP is 13.8% in patients with HIV and the prevalence of plasma cell dyscrasias (PCD) in our population is 0.02%. A previous study from this cohort[2] showed that approximately 6.4% of patients with a positive SPEP developed hematological malignancy and all patients with a faint monoclonal band had lymphoma (70.5%) and those with a definite monoclonal band had myeloma (29.5%). Even though prevalence is less than the general population rate of 3%, as patients with HIV live longer this number may increase. In our study there was a high rate of co-infection with HCV in patients who had a PCD and this needs further investigation to determine causality. PCD developed at a median of 13.9 years after HIV diagnosis. The ISS staging distribution in patients presenting with myeloma is consistent with non HIV myeloma. People with HIV tolerate standard imid or proteasome inhibitor based triple drug therapy and have successful outcomes with autologous transplantation. This is the largest cohort and report describing PCD in HIV population. References: Jou, E., et al., Viral co-infections and paraproteins in HIV: effect on development of hematological malignancies.
