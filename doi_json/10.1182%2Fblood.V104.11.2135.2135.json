    "abstract_text": "Forty patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin\u2019s disease (HD) underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) following a fludarabine-based conditioning regimen from an HLA-identical sibling (n=20) or a matched unrelated donor (n=20). The median age was 31 years (range 18-58). The median number of chemotherapy regimens received prior to allo-SCT was five (range 2-9). Thirty (75%) and thirty (75%) patients had received prior radiotherapy or a prior autologous SCT, respectively. The median time to progression after autologous SCT was nine months (3\u201352). Disease status at SCT was refractory relapse (n=14) or sensitive relapse (n=26). The conditioning regimens employed were fludarabine (25 mg/m sq IV x 5 days)-cyclophosphamide (1 g/m sq IV x 3 days) \u00b1 antithymocyte globulin (30 mg/kg IV x 3 days) (FC\u00b1ATG) (n=14), a less intensive regimen, and fludarabine (25 mg/m sq IV x 5 days) -melphalan (70 mg/m sq IV x 2 days) (FM) (n=26), a more intensive one. The two groups had similar demographics and prognostic factors. Chimerism studies indicated 100% donor-derived engraftment in 26/26 (100%) FM patients and in 9/13 (69%) evaluable FC\u00b1ATG patients. Day 100 and cumulative (18-month) transplant-related mortality (TRM) were 5 % and 22%, respectively for the whole group. There was a nonsignificant trend towards a lower cumulative TRM in the FM group (18% vs. 30% at 18 months, p=0.2). The cumulative incidence of acute (grade II-IV) GVHD was 38%. The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 18 months was 69%. There was a trend for a lower relapse rate after the occurrence of GVHD, however, this was not statistically significant (hazard ratio 0.8; p= 0.6). Progression rates were similar in the FM and FC patients (53% vs. 57% respectively at 18 months, p=0.4). However, disease progression occurred later in FM patients (range 2\u201334 months) than in FC patients (range 0.7\u201313 months). In addition, with comparable follow-up time after progression, the FM group experienced a lower death rate after progression. Twenty-four patients (60%) are alive (fourteen in complete remission) with a median follow-up of 13 months (4\u201378). Sixteen patients expired (TRM n=8, disease progression n=8). FM patients had significantly better overall survival (73% vs. 39% at 18 months; p=0.03), and a trend towards better progression-free survival (37% vs. 21% at 18 months; p=0.2). We conclude that allo-SCT with fludarabine-based, less intensive conditioning from matched related and unrelated donors are feasible in high-risk HD patients with a low TRM. The intensity of the preparative regimen affects survival.",
