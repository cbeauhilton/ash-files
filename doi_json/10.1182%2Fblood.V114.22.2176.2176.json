    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2176 Poster Board II-153 Progression from chronic phase to blast crisis (BC) remains a major hurdle on the road to effective treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). BC is known to be associated with accumulation of additional genetic alterations, but these alterations have so far been only partially characterized. The development of SNP-arrays as a tool for high-resolution karyotyping now allows to perform high-throughput genome-wide screens for submicroscopic genomic alterations with unprecedented informativity and resolution and to precisely map all the genes involved in these alterations. We have used Human 6.0 SNP Arrays (Affymetrix) to perform high-resolution molecular allelokaryotyping of 25 DNA samples from BC (myeloid, n=16; lymphoid, n=9) CML patients (pts). The 6.0 SNP Array technology relies on 1.8 million markers evenly spaced across the genome, with a median inter-marker distance 2 pts are listed in the Table below.

Although these results confirm a high degrees of heterogeneity in the alterations detectable in BC CML pts, members of the RAS pathway (indicated with an asterisk) were the most frequently altered genes. Further characterization by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing is ongoing. In conclusion, the power of 6.0 SNP Array technology allowed us to detect previously unidentified alterations targeting whole or part of key oncogenes or tumor suppressors whose deregulation may play a role in determining the aggressive phenotype of BC CML, and which may represent potential therapeutic targets.
