    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4930 Objectives: To develop the use of CD64 expression as an early diagnostic of adult collagen disease, we elucidated normal levels in neonates, infants and children. Methods: Blood samples were collected from a total of 62 symptom- and infection-free subjects recruited at our outpatient department: neonates (n=80), infants (n=41), 1- to 5-year-old children (n=77), 6- to 10-year-old children (n=58), children 11 years old or older and adults (n=95). CD64 expression per neutrophil was quantitatively determined by flow cytometry using a BD FACS Calibur HG flow cytometer (Becton Dicknson, BD) and BD CellQuest Pro analysis software (BD). Fluorescence was measured and converted to number of CD64 molecules per cell using a phycoerythrin (PE) fluorescence kit (Quantibrite PE; BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Iwate Medical University. Results: CD64 expression level in neonates (median, 1981 molecules per neutrophil; range, 908\u20139844), infants (1666.5, 572\u201312941), and 1- to 5-year-old children (1778, 545\u201311283) was significantly higher than that in children 11 years old or older and adults (1280, 533\u201311205) (p<0.01 or <0.05). There were no differences in expression between 6- and 10-year-old children (1529, 439\u20139214) and children 11 years old or older and adults. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the normal value for adults can not be applied for neonates, infants, and 1- to 5-year-old children. To use CD64 expression level on neutrophils as an infection marker in neonates, infants and 1- to 5-year-old children cut-off values higher than that in adults must be established.
