    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2424 Introduction Tumor necrosis factor receptor super families (TNFRSFs) play an important role in activation of lymphocyte and cell apoptosis. However the function of TNFRSFs in multiple myeloma (MM) remains unknown. Loss of function mutation of Fas antigen (TNFRSF6) was identified in MM cells, thus suggesting the possible role of TNFRSFs in regulating MM pathogenesis. We therefore investigated the epigenetic mechanisms that may mediate inactivation of TNFRSFs and its functional role in MM. Methods Dchip software was utilized for analyzing gene expression dataset. DNA was extracted from both primary CD138+ MM plasma cells and MM cell lines using blood & tissue DNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Inc.). Expression of GITR in primary CD138+ plasma cells was detected by Imunohistochemistry (IHC) DNA methylation was analyzed by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (Medip) assay and bisulfate sequencing. 5'azacytidine was used to demethylate genomic DNA. Gene expression was detected by qRT-PCR and confirmed at the protein level by flow cytometry and western-blot. Over-expression of GITR was obtained in MM1.S cells by using GITR recombinant plasmid and electroporation. Apoptosis was determined using Annexin/PI staining and flow cytometry analysis. Activation of apoptotic signaling was studied by western blot. Cell survival and proliferation were analyzed by MTT and BrdU assay, respectively. Recombinant GITR-lentivirus was obtained from the supernatant of culture medium after 72 hours transfection in 293 cells. GFP positive MM cells were sorted and analyzed by flow cytometry. In vivo effect of GITR on MM tumor growth was determined by injection of GITR over-expressing MM cells in null mice. Mice skull, femur and vertebrae were isolated after 4 weeks injection. Anti-human CD138+ mAb microbead was used to detect MM cells extracted from mice tissue by flow cytometry. Results Gene-expression profiling showed down-regulation of TNFRSFs, including TNFRSF11A, TNFRSF11B, TNFRSF8, TNFRSF10C, TNFRSF9, TNFRSF21, TNFRSF1B, TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF18, compared to normal plasma cells. Moreover, Our IHC results also showed that GITR expression was positive in primary CD138+ plasma cells from 9 normal bone marrow, but negative in 9 MM samples. Importantly, we found that low GITR expression significantly correlated with MM progression. Indeed, GITR gene levels were lower in smoldering and active MM patients compared to MGUS patients and normal donors. Promoter CpG island (CGI) methylation of GITR was indentified in 5 out of 7 MM primary bone marrow (BM)-derived CD138+ cells but not in normal BM-derived plasma cells. Bisulfate sequencing and Medip assay showed that methylation of GITR was significantly associated with GITR expression in 5 MM cell lines, including MM1.S, OPM1, U266, RPMI and INA6. Promoter CGI of GITR was highly methylated leading to complete silencing of GITR in MM1.S cell line. GITR expression was significantly up-regulated in MM cells upon treatment with the 5'azacytidine. MTT and BrdU assay revealed that the proliferation and survival of MM1.S cells was disrupted in the GITR over-expressing MM1.S cells, notably with inhibition of cell proliferation compared to control vector infected cells. Moreover induction of cytotoxicity in GITR over-expressing cells was confirmed by using GFP competition assay. GITR-induced apoptosis was supported by induction of caspase 8 and 3 cleavage. The inhibition of human CD138+ plasma cell growth in the bone marrow of SCID mice using a disseminated MM xenograft model was observed in the experimental group injected with GITR expressing cells compared to the control group after 4 weeks injection. Conclusion Our findings uncovered a novel epigenetic mechanism contributing to MM pathogenesis, showing the role of GITR methylation as a key regulator of MM cell survival.
