    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4174 Trithorax and Polycomb-group (Trx-G and Pc-G) proteins are antagonistic regulators of homeobox-containing (Hox) gene expression that play a major role in regulation of hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. Mixed lineage leukemia (MLL), a mammalian Trx-G protein, is a histone methyltransferase crucial for embryonic development and hematopoiesis that is commonly altered by translocation in acute leukemia. Recent evidence suggests that transformation by MLL fusion proteins is dependent on multiple interaction complexes, including the polymerase associated factor complex (PAFc) and the elongation activating protein complex (EAPc) or a closely related AF4 family/ENL family/P-TEFb complex (AEPc). CBX8 is a human PcG protein, functioning as a transcription repressor in the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). Previous studies have shown that CBX8 also interacts with the EAPc components AF9 and ENL; however, its role in leukemogenesis is unknown. To elucidate the significance of this interaction between these two proteins thought to have antagonistic function, we generated a large series of point mutations in AF9 and identified two amino acids that are essential for CBX8 interaction but preserve the interaction with other EAP components. Mutation of the two sites reduced the transcriptional activation of the MLL-AF9 target promoters by nearly 50% and completely inhibits the ability of MLL-AF9 to immortalize bone marrow (BM) as assessed by methylcellulose replating assays. This finding suggests that CBX8 interaction is essential for MLL-AF9-induced leukemogenesis. Several lines of evidence further support this finding. First, CBX8 knockdown by siRNAs decreased MLL-AF9-induced transcriptional activation by approximately 50%. Second, the ability of MLL-AF9 to transform primary BM was markedly reduced by retroviral shCbx8 transduction. Notably, this inhibitory effect is specific for MLL-AF9 because the BM transformation ability of E2A-HLF was unaffected by Cbx8 suppression. Third, Cbx8 suppression by shCbx8 in MLL-AF9 and MLL-ENL, but not E2A-HLF transformed AML cell lines, significantly inhibited the expression of MLL-dependent target genes, as well as cell growth and colony forming ability. Fourth, inducing CBX8 knockdown in human leukemia cell lines expressing MLL-AF9 led to a marked decrease in the localization of basic transcription machinery at the Hoxa9 locus and a corresponding reduction in Hoxa9 transcription. Importantly, the observed effects of CBX8 on MLL -rearranged leukemia cells are PRC1-independent: no effects on MLL target gene expression, cell growth, or BM transformation ability were observed by suppressing other core components of PRC1. Taken together, our results indicate that CBX8, independent of its transcription repression role in PRC1, interacts with and synergizes with MLL fusion proteins to promote leukemogenesis. Defining the interaction sites between AF9/ENL and CBX8 and the dependence of other AML subtypes and normal hematopoiesis on CBX8 will be important for the further development of agents that target this mechanism in MLL -rearranged and potentially other AML subtypes.
