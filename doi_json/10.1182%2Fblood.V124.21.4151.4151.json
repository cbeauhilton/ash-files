The identification of millions of new variants, which are mainly rare and assessing their implications for human health presents new challenges to researchers and clinicians. We have analyzed missense variants in the ITGB2A and ITGB3 genes obtained from whole exome and whole genome sequencing (WES & WGS) data from 5 databases: The Human Genome Mutation Database, the 1000 Genomes project, the UK10K Whole Exome Sequencing project, the UK10K Whole Genome Sequencing project, and The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Exome Sequencing Project. Together, these encompass variants of the platelet \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin receptor from ~32,000 alleles derived from 16,108 individuals. We identified 111 missense variants that have previously been associated with Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT), 20 variants associated with alloimmune thrombocytopenia, and 5 variants associated with aniso/macrothrombocytopenia. None of the GT variants were found in the last four databases, indicating that they have minor allele frequencies (MAF) less than ~0.01%, attesting to both their rarity and the likelihood that they entered the population within the last ~2,500 years. We also identified 114 novel missense variants in ITGB2A affecting ~11% of the amino acids and 68 novel missense variants in ITGB3 affecting ~9% of the amino acids. 96% of the novel variants had MAF <0.1%, indicating their rarity. Based on sequence conservation, MAF, and/or location of the substituted residue on a complete model of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 that suggested a possible effect on protein folding, we selected three novel variants (\u03b1IIb P943A and P176H, and \u03b23 C547G) that affect amino acids previously associated with GT for expression in HEK 293 cells. Both \u03b1IIb P176H and \u03b23 C547G severely affected \u03b1IIb\u03b23 expression, whereas \u03b1IIb P943A had only a partial effect on expression and no effect on DTT-induced fibrinogen binding. We were not surprised that the latter variant did not have a severe effect on expression or function because it has an MAF (0.46%) that is much higher than the MAFs of the other GT-causing variants. To estimate the percentage of the 114 novel identified variants that are likely to be deleterious we used 3 different algorithms, CADD, Polyphen 2-HDVI, and SIFT. The algorithms showed moderate concordance in their rankings of the likelihood that a variant is deleterious. To compare their predictive powers, we performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis based on their ability to discriminate confirmed GT missense variants (positive controls) from alloantigens (negative controls); the area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.91, 0.88, and 0.90, respectively. At cutoff values that achieved greater than 95% sensitivity for each algorithm: 1) the specificity values were 75%, 65%, and 60%, and 2) the percentages of novel \u03b1IIb+\u03b23 missense variants predicted to be deleterious were 43%, 56%, and 58%. Polyphen 2-HDVI and SIFT identified \u03b1IIb P176H and \u03b23 C547G as highly likely to be deleterious and \u03b1IIb P943A as much less likely to be deleterious, whereas CADD did not differentiate them in the same way. We conclude that ~1.1% of individuals in the populations studied carry at least one missense variant in \u03b1IIb or \u03b23 and that 0.6% carry a variant that might be deleterious and therefore may result in a hemorrhagic GT-like phenotype. The rarity of almost all of the novel missense variants identified indicates that they entered the population recently. Despite having detailed knowledge of the structure and function of \u03b1IIb\u03b23, it is difficult to predict with certainty the impact of any single missense variant. This will pose serious challenges as more individuals undergo WES and WGS; we anticipate that linkage to health record data, as will happen for the UK 100,000 Genomes project, will aid clinical interpretation. Finally, \u201chypomorphic\u201d gene variants that produce only a partial decrease in expression, such as \u03b1IIb P943A, may contribute to the wide variation in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 surface expression observed in the healthy population.
