    "abstract_text": "Treatment of patients refractory to immunosuppressive therapy is a major problem in the management of aplastic anemia (AA). Some patients who are ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation have been successfully treated with anabolic steroids although little is known about the common characteristics of these patients. In order to characterize high responders to danazol, we retrospectively studied 44 AA (13 male and 31 female) patients who were treated with 300 mg of danazol daily for at least 3 months. All patients had been previously treated with ATG+CsA or CsA alone without appreciable effects before danazol therapy. Peripheral blood of these patients was examined for the presence of PNH-type cells and clonality in granulocytes using sensitive flow cytometry ( Blood  100 : 3897 , 2002 ) and the improved HUMARA assay ( Blood  102 : 1211 , 2003 ). 24 of 44 (55%) patients attained PR or CR according to the response criteria proposed by Camitta. All 3 lineage cells increased in the responders. The rate of response in female patients (21/31, 68%) was significantly higher than that (3/13, 23%) in male patients ( P =0.0058). There was no difference in the response rate between older (>50 years) patients (75%) and younger (<50 years) patients (60%) in female patients, indicating that the effect of danazol is not affected by a female sex hormone. Increased PNH-type cells were detectable in 2 (8.3%) of 24 responders and in 6 (40%) of 15 non-responders. The HUMARA assay revealed presence of clonal granulocyte population in 13 (76%) of 17 responders and 2 (33%) of 6 non-responders, respectively. For a female patient without increased PNH type cells who has not responded to immunosuppressive therapy, the rate of response to danazol was 64%. Probability of 3-year survival in responders to danazol was 100% while that in non-responders to the therapy was 90%. Univariate analysis revealed that negativity for increased PNH-type cell and being female were significantly associated with good response to danazol. These findings indicate that danazol is a useful drug in the treatment of a subset of female AA patients characterized by refractoriness to conventional immunosuppressive therapy and absence of increased PNH-type cells. Given the high frequency of clonal hematopoiesis in responders to danazol, this anabolic steroid may stimulate expansion of a small number of stem cells that survived non-immune marrow insult.",
