    "abstract_text": "Background : The presence of TP53 aberrations (defined as del(17p) or TP53 gene mutation) is a strong negative predictor of survival in patients (pts) with CLL. First-line chemoimmunotherapy is suboptimal in pts with CLL bearing TP53 aberrations, with 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of only 18% and 38%, respectively, with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (Hallek, Lancet 2010). Ibrutinib is the only once-daily Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor with significant PFS and OS benefit demonstrated in multiple randomized phase 3 studies (eg, RESONATE-2, ECOG1912) in the first-line treatment of CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Previous reports of single-agent ibrutinib or ibrutinib-based combination treatments have further demonstrated favorable PFS benefit in pts with TP53 aberrations in both the first-line and relapsed/refractory settings. Despite these study-specific subgroup analyses, there are limited data on long-term outcomes in pts with TP53 aberrations treated with first-line BTK inhibitors. We performed a pooled analysis of data across 4 studies to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of first-line ibrutinib-based therapy in pts with CLL bearing TP53 aberrations. Methods : Data for first-line ibrutinib treatment in pts with TP53 aberrations were pooled across 4 clinical trials in CLL/SLL: PCYC-1122e (NCT01500733; single-agent ibrutinib; n=34), PCYC-1130 (NCT02264574; ibrutinib + obinutuzumab; n=18), ECOG1912 (NCT02048813; ibrutinib + rituximab; n=26), and RESONATE-2 (NCT01722487; single-agent ibrutinib; n=11). ECOG1912 and RESONATE-2 excluded pts with del(17p) but did not exclude pts with TP53 mutations. Long-term PFS (assessed by investigator), OS, and safety are reported. Results : Eighty-nine pts with TP53 aberrations receiving first-line ibrutinib treatment were included in this pooled analysis. Median age was 65 years (range 33-87), and 69% of pts were male. At baseline, 53% had Rai stage III/IV, 38% had bulky disease (lymph nodes \u22655 cm), and 69% (of 87 evaluable) had unmutated IGHV. All patients had either del(17p) or TP53 mutation; 53% (of 89 evaluable) had del(17p) and 91% (of 58 evaluable) had TP53 mutation. Among 16 pts with del(17p) who had TP53 sequencing results available, 11 (69%) had both del(17p) and TP53 mutation. Forty-five pts received ibrutinib as a single agent and 44 received ibrutinib in combination with an anti-CD20 agent. With a median follow-up of 50 months (range 0.1 to 95.9 months), median PFS was not reached (95% CI: 67 months to not estimable; Figure 1A ). At 48 months, the PFS rate was 79% and the OS rate was 88% ( Figure 1B ). Median duration of ibrutinib treatment was 46 months (range 0.1 to 95.5 months). Reasons for treatment discontinuation were progressive disease (20%), study closure (12%), adverse event (10%), withdrawal by pt (7%), death (3%), and other (physician decision due to scheduled pt surgery; 1%). Grade \u22653 adverse events of clinical interest with up to 8 years of treatment with ibrutinib were infection (22%; most commonly pneumonia in 7%), hypertension (13%), atrial fibrillation (12%), and major hemorrhage (7%). With the current follow-up, 46% of pts with TP53 aberrations remained on ibrutinib treatment. Conclusions : With a median follow-up of 4 years, first-line ibrutinib-based treatment resulted in sustained efficacy with high PFS and OS rates in CLL pts with TP53 aberrations, a population with historically poor outcomes. Although pts with TP53 aberrations remain at risk for progression, first-line treatment with ibrutinib has partially overcome the poor prognosis in this high-risk population with 4-year PFS and OS rates of 79% and 88%, respectively. No new safety signals were identified in this analysis. These results from a large, pooled, multi-study dataset demonstrated the long-term benefit of first-line ibrutinib-based treatment in pts with TP53 aberrations.
