    "abstract_text": "Abstract 418 About 20% of all patients with first diagnosis of Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) are older than 60 years. They have a poor prognosis mainly due to an increased toxicity of chemo- and radiotherapy. Although resulting in better disease control, aggressive regimens as BEACOPP are not feasible in this cohort of patients due to a treatment related mortality of up to 20%. Therefore, ABVD is considered treatment of choice for elderly HL patients, although prospective studies are lacking and current concepts mostly rely on cohort analyses. We therefore analyzed feasibility, safety and outcome of patients older than 60 years with early favorable- or early unfavorable-stage HL treated with 4 cycles of ABVD within the HD10 and HD11 trials of the GHSG. Sixty-eight and 49 elderly patients with a median age of 65 and 64 years were treated in HD10 and HD11, respectively. Early termination of protocol therapy was documented in 18% of HD10 patients, but only in 8% of HD11 patients, resulting in a lower relative total chemotherapy dose (RCD) in HD10. The relative dose intensity (RCD divided by total relative chemotherapy duration) was much lower in both studies compared to younger patients, due to more toxicity-related therapy delays and dose reductions, as 4 cycles of ABVD caused WHO grade III/IV toxicities in 67% (HD10) and 69% (HD11). Overall efficacy was significantly lower than in younger patients with an overall response rate of 90% in HD10 and 92% in HD11. The rate of relapsing patients was the same as in younger patients in HD11 (14%), whereas in HD10 it was much higher in the elderly (12%) which was mainly due to late relapses. Overall 22% and 37% of the patients died in HD10 and HD11, respectively (median observation time: 92 months). Besides other causes as cardiovascular disease (7%) or secondary neoplasia (5%), there was a high rate of deaths due to insufficient HL-control (5%) and treatment-related toxicities (5%). The 5-year PFS estimates for elderly patients were 79% (95% CI, 67% to 87%) in HD10 and 69% (95% CI, 54% to 80%) in HD11 compared to 96% (95% CI, 93% to 97%) and 86% (95% CI, 83% to 88%) for younger patients in HD10 and HD11, respectively. In conclusion, 4 cycles of ABVD are effective in elderly HL patients; however, treatment-related toxicity is high. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
