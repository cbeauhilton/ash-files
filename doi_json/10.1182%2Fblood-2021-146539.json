    "abstract_text": "Background : T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL), a rare lymphoproliferative disorder of mature T cells, is characterized by the accumulation of activated effector T cells leading to a clonally restricted T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Chronic antigen stimulation together with activating somatic STAT3 mutations have been proposed to lead to clonal expansion of leukemic cells. However, no holistic research has been done to show how leukemic and non-leukemic cells liaise to sustain abnormal immune reactivity in T-LGLL. Methods : We investigated the transcriptome and TCR repertoire in T-LGLL using: 1) single-cell RNA and TCR (scRNA+TCR\u03b1\u03b2) sequencing from CD45+ sorted blood cells (T-LGLL n=11, healthy n=6), 2) TCR\u03b2 sequencing from blood mononuclear cells (T-LGLL n=48, healthy n=823), 3) bulk RNA sequencing (T-LGLL n=15, healthy n=5), 4) plasma cytokine profiling (T-LGLL n=9, healthy n=9), and 5) flow cytometry validations (T-LGLL n=6, healthy n=6) (Figure) Results : ScRNA+TCR\u03b1\u03b2-seq data revealed that in healthy controls, hyperexpanded CD8+ T-cell clones (at least 10 cells with identical TCRs) preferentially had an effector memory phenotype, whereas in T-LGLL, the hyperexpanded clonotypes represented a more cytotoxic (increased expression of GZMB , PRF1 , KLRB1 ) and exhausted ( LAG3 and TIGIT ) phenotype. Using flow cytometry, we confirmed that upon anti-CD3/CD28/CD49 antibody stimulation, T-LGLL clones (CD8+CD57+) expressed higher levels of cytotoxic proteins (GZMA / GZMB , PRF1) but were deficient in degranulation responses and cytokine secretion as measured by expression of CD107a/b and TNF\u03b1/IFN\u03b3, respectively. Focused re-clustering of the extracted T-LGLL clones from the scRNA+TCR\u03b1\u03b2-seq data revealed considerable heterogeneity among the T-LGLL clones and partly separated the mutated (mt) STAT3 and wild type (wt) STAT3 clones. STAT3wt clones upregulated T-cell activation and TCR signaling pathways, with a higher cytotoxicity and lower exhaustion score as compared to STAT3mt clones. This was validated with bulk RNA-seq data. To understand the antigen specificities of the T-LGLL clones, we combined previously profiled T-LGLL TCRs with our data to form the largest described dataset of 200 T-LGLL clones from 170 patients. Notably, T-LGLL clones were found to be private to each patient. Furthermore, the analysis by GLIPH2 algorithm grouping TCRs did not reveal detectable structural similarities, suggesting the absence of a unifying antigen in T-LGLL. However, in 67% of T-LGLL patients, the TCRs of leukemic clones shared amino acid level similarities with the rest of the non-leukemic TCR repertoire suggesting that the clonal and non-clonal immune repertoires are connected via common target antigens. To analyze the non-clonal immune repertoire in T-LGLL in detail, we compared our data to other published scRNAseq data from solid tumors (n=4) and hematologic cancers (n=8) and healthy controls (n=6). The analysis revealed that in T-LGLL also the non-leukemic CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were more mature, cytotoxic, and clonally restricted. When compared to healthy controls and other cancer patients, in non-leukemic T-LGLL the most upregulated pathway was IFN\u03b3 response. Finally, most of the upregulated cytokines in T-LGLL (e.g., CCL2/3/7, CXCL10/11, IL15RA) were secreted predominantly by monocytes and dendritic cells, which also had upregulated HLA class II expression and enhanced scavenging potential in T-LGLL patients. Ligand-receptor analysis with CellPhoneDB revealed that the number of predicted cell-cell interactions was significantly higher in T-LGLL as compared to reactive T-cell clones in healthy controls. The most co-stimulatory interactions (e.g., CD2 - CD58 , TNFSF14 - TNFRSF14 ) occurred between the IFN\u03b3 secreting T-LGLL clones and the pro-inflammatory cytokine secreting monocytes. Conclusions : Our study shows a synergistic interplay between the leukemic and non-leukemic immune cell repertoires in T-LGLL, where an aberrant antigen-driven immune response including hyperexpanded CD8+ T-LGLL cells, non-leukemic CD8+ cells, CD4+ cells, and monocytes contribute to the persistence of the T-LGLL clones. Our results provide a rationale to prioritize therapies that target the entire immune repertoire and not only the T-LGLL clones in patients with T-LGLL.
