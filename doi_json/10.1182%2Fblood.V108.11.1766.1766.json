    "abstract_text": "In sickle cell anemia (SCD) and thalassemia, although the basic lesions are mutations in the globin genes, the pathophysiology involves oxidative stress-mediated cell damage in the bone marrow (ineffective erythropoiesis due to apoptosis of early erythroid precursors) and in the peripheral blood (chronic hemolysis of mature RBC). In addition, some patients develop thromboembolic complications and recurrent bacterial infections, the etiology of which is related at least in part, to documented oxidative stress in platelets and neutrophils (PMN), respectively. To study the presence and the role of oxidative stress in thalassemia and SCD, we adapted flow cytometry techniques for measuring the generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), the content of reduced glutathione (GSH), membrane lipid peroxidation and externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) moieties in RBC, platelets and PMN. Cells derived from the peripheral blood of patients with beta-thalassemia major, intermedia or SCD showed increased oxidative status (increased ROS, lipid peroxidation and PS externalization, and decreased GSH) compared with their normal counterparts. Incubating fresh blood samples from patients with thalassemia major and thalassemia intermedia with 10 mg/ml FPP for 16 hours at 37 o C reduced the oxidative status of RBC as well as platelets and PMN. Experiments carried out in normal and thalassemic mice ( Th3/+ , a mouse model of human beta-thalassemia intermedia demonstrated that mice treated for one week with 10 mg/ml FPP (dissolved in the drinking water) had reduced oxidative stress compared to control mice. The in-vivo effect of FPP was tested on 9 patients with beta-thalassemia (6 - major and 3 - intermedia) treated with 3 gr FPP per os three times a day for 12\u201315 weeks. Following the treatment, the ROS in RBC, platelets and PMN decreased and the GSH increased in all patients (see table). Six of these patients responded by a modest increase in RBC, reticulocytes and hemoglobin levels. These results suggest that FPP may have an important clinical efficacy as an antioxidant in thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. The in vivo effect of FPP treatment of beta-thalassemia patients  . . .
