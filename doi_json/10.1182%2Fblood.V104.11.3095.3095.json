    "abstract_text": "It has been recently shown that the first bleeding onset in children with severe hemophilia A (HA) carrying prothrombotic risk factors is significantly later in life than in non-carriers. 1 The present multicenter study was performed to determine whether the factor (F) V G1691A or the F II G20210A are associated with decreased annual bleeding episodes (ABE) in 106 pediatric PUP patients with severe HA (Intron 22 58.6%) consecutively admitted to German pediatric hemophilia treatment centers. Treatment was initiated according to the frequency of bleedings, and most patients received on demand therapy with a switch over to prophylactic therapy 3x/week (40\u201360 IU/kgKG factor VIIII concentrate) when more than three bleedings (range 2\u20136) had occurred into the same joint (n=49). Prospective median(range) patient follow-up was 14(4\u201335) years. Heterozygosity of the FV mutation was found in 8 subjects, homozygosity in one, and 5 children carried the FII mutation once combined with protein C-deficiency. Carriers of the FV and FII mutations had significantly fewer ABE than non-carriers (p=0.004). 66 of 106 PUP patients developed at least one target joint with a median(range) Pettersson score of 1(0\u201312) available in 57 patients clearly dependent on age (p=0.039) as well as ABE (p=0.037). The \u201cNuss\u201d joint score available in 33 subjects highly correlated with the Pettersson score (p=0.007). Data presented here give evidence that the clinical expression of severe HA in children is influenced by the co-expression of the FV and FII mutation."
