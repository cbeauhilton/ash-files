    "abstract_text": "Acute chest syndrome (ACS) and pulmonary hypertension are complications of sickle cell disease (SCD). The effects of pre-existing respiratory symptoms on the frequency of complications of SCD, such as vaso-occlusive crises and ACS, have not been fully explored. Many therapeutic options exist for patients with reactive airway disease or other recurrent respiratory problems. Control of associated symptoms may help prevent the occurrence of ACS and other sickle cell-related problems. We compared the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in SCD patients compared to patients with other hematological disorders. Methods : Two questionnaires (one for patients with SCD, one for patients with other hematological disorders) were developed, which included questions regarding respiratory symptoms (especially wheezing and cough, frequency of these symptoms, previous diagnosis of asthma), personal history and environmental exposure. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and patients and their caregivers were interviewed during a routine visit to the outpatient hematology clinic after giving informed consent. Results : To date, 124 subjects have been interviewed (62 males and 58 females, ages 3\u201318 years, mean age 10.1yrs), and 120 questionnaires were evaluable, including 59 from patients with SCD and 61 from the comparison group. Respiratory symptoms (wheezing and cough) were more frequent in SCD patients compared to patients with other hematological diseases. Wheezing was present in 34 (58%) SCD patients and in 20 (33%) patients in the other group (p<0.01). Twelve patients (20%) in the SCD group missed school due to respiratory problems (over half of them missed more than 7 days of school) compared to 4 (6%) patients (only 1 missing school for more than 7 days) in the other group (p<0.04). Hospitalization due to respiratory problems before the age of 2 years was more common in SCD patients: 23 (39%) compared to 8 (13%) in other hematological patients (p<0.003). Conclusions : The prevalence of pulmonary symptoms is higher in patients with SCD compared to patients with other hematological disorders and associated with frequent hospitalizations and school absences.",
