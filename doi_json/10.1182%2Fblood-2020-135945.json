    "abstract_text": "Background: The GATLA Collaborative Group has a 50 year (y) long experience of running cooperative trials for lymphomas in Argentina. Aim: Describe the outcome of pediatric patients(pts) treated according to the international cooperative work with AHOPCA and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (11-EHP-12) adopting OEPA/COPDAC strategy for High Risk (HR) pts and ABVD for Intermediate (IR) and Low Risk (LR) pts. Methods: 11-EHP-12: Risk assignment according Stanford/Danna Farber/ SJCRH Consortium classification. LR: ABVD x 4\u00b1 IFRT (20 Gy). IR: ABVD x 6 \u00b1 IFRT (20 Gy). HR: OEPA-COPDAC+IFRT (20/25 Gy). Response evaluation: LR after 4 th cycle, IR and HR after the 2 nd cycle. Complete Remission (CR): response > 80% reduction and PET negative. Partial Remission (PR): response >50% and <80% reduction and/or PET positive. 170 pediatric patients (pts) were enrolled since November 2012. 133 evaluable pts. 37 on treatment and/or a follow up of less than 5 years. Sex: M/F: 85 (63,9%) /48. Median age: 13 y (range 4-18 y). Histology: nodular sclerosis 91 (68,4%), mixed celularity 31 (23.3%), lymphocyte rich 1 (0,7%), lymphocyte depleted 1 (0,7%), nodular lymphocyte predominant 8 (6,9%). Stage: I :16 (12%), II: 51 (38.4%), III: 27 (20.3%), IV: 39 (29.3%). B Symptoms: 66 (49.6%). Interim evaluation: PET/TC: 109/133 (82%), TC: 24. Distribution by risk groups: HR pts.: 77 (57,9%), IR: 35 (26,3%), LR: 21 (15,8%). Results: 5 y OS was 94% (100% for LR and IR, and 91% HR) and 5y EFS was 88% (100% for LR, 91% IR, and 84% HR). 95% of the LR pts and 72% of the IR pts did not undergo radiotherapy. 70% of the HR pts achieved CR after the 2 nd OEPA and received 20 Gy IFRT. According PR or CR after 2 nd OEPA, the 5y EFS in HR pts was 84% and 90% respectively. Conclusion: Thanks to this international cooperation We could significantly improve the results in Argentina compared to our previous experience (7-PHD-96: COPP-ABV x 6 + IFRT Bulky disease or PR (20/25Gy): 5yOS:85%, 5yEFS:67%), reduce the number of patients who required radiotherapy and reproduce the Euronet experience for HR pts in a different context.
