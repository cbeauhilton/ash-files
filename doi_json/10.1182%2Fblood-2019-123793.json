    "abstract_text": "Introduction FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutations are found in approximately one quarter of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. Its presence results in constitutive activation of the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase and its downstream growth/pro-survival pathways including MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and JAK/STAT, and confers a poor prognosis. Gilteritinib is a selective inhibitor of FLT3 recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory AML and a FLT3 mutation. However, gilteritinib exposure induces upregulation of FLT3 - a mechanism of resistance. Previously, we showed that CUDC-907, a dual PI3K/histone deacetylase inhibitor, downregulates FLT3 expression ( Li X, et al. Haematologica. 2019; epub ahead of print ). We therefore hypothesized that combining CUDC-907 with gilteritinib would abrogate FLT3 upregulation and expression, resulting in synergistic antileukemic activities against FLT3-mutated AML. Methods FLT3-ITD AML cell lines and primary patient samples were treated with gilteritinib or CUDC-907, alone or in combination at clinically achievable concentrations, and subjected to annexin V/propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analysis to quantify apoptosis. Protein levels of FLT3, Bcl-2 family proteins, and key components of the MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and JAK/STAT pathways were examined using western blotting. The impact of the observed alterations upon apoptosis were confirmed via overexpression, knockdown, and targeted inhibitor experiments. Real-time RT-PCR was used to determine FLT3 transcript levels. The FLT3-ITD AML cell line MV4-11 was used to generate a xenograft mouse model to assess in vivo efficacy of the two agents. Results CUDC-907 and gilteritinib demonstrated potent synergistic antileukemic effects in FLT3-ITD AML cell lines in vitro and patient samples ex vivo , with combined therapy. CUDC-907 abolished gilteritinib-induced expression of FLT3 in both cell lines and primary patient samples. Gilteritinib treatment reduced p-AKT, p-S6, and p-STAT5 and increased p-ERK, while CUDC-907 reduced p-AKT and p-ERK, and upregulated p-STAT5. The combination of gilteritinib and CUDC-907 decreased not only p-AKT and p-S6, but also p-ERK and p-STAT5. Targeted inhibition of ERK and JAK2/STAT5 signaling by SCH772984 and AZD1480, respectively, confirmed their roles in resistance to gilteritinib and CUDC-907 monotherapies, respectively. Combined gilteritinib and CUDC-907 treatment reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family member Mcl-1 and increased expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim. MCL-1 overexpression and BIM knockdown partially rescued FLT3-ITD AML cells upon drug treatment, confirming their role in the antileukemic activity of combined gilteritinib and CUDC-907. To determine in vivo efficacy of the two agents, NSGS mice were injected with MV4-11 cells. Three days later, the mice were randomized into vehicle control (n=5), 40 mg/kg gilteritinib (oral gavage; n=5), 100 mg/kg CUDC-907 (oral gavage; n=5) or combination (40 mg/kg gilteritinib + 100 mg/kg CUDC-907; n=6) groups. CUDC-907 was given daily for 5 days on, 2 days off, for a total of 4 cycles. Gilteritinib was administered daily for 28 days. Both agents were well tolerated; maximal weight loss was 5.5%, 0.9%, and 6.7% in the CUDC-907, gilteritinib, and combination groups, respectively. Median survival of mice in the vehicle control group was 43 days. Median survival in the CUDC-907 monotherapy and gilteritinib monotherapy arm was 40.5 days and 104 days, respectively. One mouse in the combination therapy arm died on day 138, while the remaining 5 mice in the combination therapy arm continue to survive, as of time of writing (day 168), and are asymptomatic (Figure 1). Conclusion We confirmed that the combination of CUDC-907 plus gilteritinib synergistically induces apoptosis in both FLT3-ITD AML cell lines and primary patient samples, and that gilteritinib-induced FLT3 expression is abolished by CUDC-907. Cooperative inhibition of the PI3K-AKT, JAK-STAT, and RAS-RAF pathways, as well as upregulation of Bim/downregulation of Mcl-1 all appear to contribute to this observed antileukemic synergy. Our cell line-derived xenograft mouse model provides strong evidence of in vivo efficacy and robust grounds for clinical translation of this therapeutic combination.
