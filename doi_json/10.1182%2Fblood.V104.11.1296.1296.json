    "abstract_text": "Angiogenesis plays an important role in tumor growth. Endothelial cells express the chemokine receptor CXCR4, and interact with its ligand SDF-1/CXCL12. Previous studies have demonstrated that the ERK MAP kinase and the PI3Kinase pathways are activated in response to SDF-1 stimulation. In this study, we investigate the effect of the role of inhibitors of CXCR4, ERK MAP kinase and PI3Kinase on angiogenesis. The AngioKit (TCS Cellworks, U.K) is a 24 well plate in which human endothelial cells are co-cultured with other human myoblasts and fibroblasts in a specially designed medium. Control wells in the kit include media alone, VEGF (+control) and suramin (-control). Test samples were added on the day the kits arrive, then changed on days 4, 7, and 9, and stained on day 11 with CD31 (PECAM). The wells are then photographed and subjected to image analysis. The software measures angiogenesis as total tubule length per well in microns. Test samples can then be compared to the control wells to determine the drugs affect on angiogenesis in vitro. The following drugs were tested in this angiogenesis model system, a human CXCR4 neutralizing antibody (MAB 171, R&D systems, MN), SDF-1, the MAP kinase inhibitor PD098059, and the PI3Kinase inhibitor LY294002. Treatment with the CXCR4 inhibitory antibody, PD098059, and LY294002 caused marked decrease in angiogenesis (below the level of the negative control suramin). Inhibition of angiogenesis below the level of suramin was first detected at 1mg/ml CXCR4 antibody, and10mg/ml CXCR4 antibody resulted in complete inhibition of angiogenesis. The effect of PD098059 on angiogenesis was dependent on its concentration; 20mM PD098059 inhibited angiogenesis while lower concentrations did not. These results are consistent with the drug\u2019s known concentration-dependent inhibition of MEK-1 and indicate that the MEK-1 inhibitor leads to angiostasis secondary to its specific inhibitory effect on MEK-1. The lowest level tested of 1\u03bcM LY294002 led to inhibition of angiogenesis, and 50\u03bcM of LY294002 led to complete abrogation of angiogenesis. SDF-1 has been reported to be angiogenic. In this model system, the effect of SDF-1 alone on angiogenesis was subtle. However, the endothelial cells used in this model system may be secreting endogenous SDF-1 leading to the saturation of the CXCR4 receptor and minimal effects of exogenous SDF-1 stimulation. This was demonstrated by the significant effect of the CXCR4 inhibitor on angiogenesis without the addition of exogenous SDF-1. These results indicate that CXCR4 inhibition and its downstream pathways PI3K and ERK MAP kinase lead to significant inhibition of angiogenesis, and suggest that selective inhibitors of CXCR4 may be useful agents to inhibit angiogenesis.",
