    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells redirected against CD19 have demonstrated remarkable clinical activity in children and adults with relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-cell malignancies. The risk of lineage switch (LS) following CD19-directed therapies has been well documented but has been primarily limited to case reports. Additionally, the risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMN) following CAR T-cells has not yet been described. Distinguishing LS (B-ALL to myeloid malignancy) from a therapy-related myeloid neoplasm is both clinically and biologically relevant. The former emerges from a highly refractory leukemic clone, likely resistant to salvage therapy, whereas the latter represents a new malignancy that can be associated with long-term survival. Methods: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective review of children and young adults with r/r B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) who received either commercial tisagenlecleucel or 1 of 3 investigational murine-based CD19-CAR constructs on clinical trials at 7 US centers between 2012-2019. Patients diagnosed with B-ALL before age 25 years were included and patients who had received any prior CAR product were excluded. Results: Of 420 CAR-treated patients, with a median follow-up of 30.1 months, 12 (2.9%) experienced LS and 6 (1.4%) developed a SMN (Table). The median time to diagnosis of LS following CAR T-cell infusion was significantly shorter compared to diagnosis of SMN (65.5 days vs. 883.5 days; p=0.005). Eleven of 12 patients (91.7%) with LS converted to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). One patient converted to mixed phenotype acute leukemia, B/myeloid type. The leukemia of 10 of 12 patients with LS harbored cytogenetics similar to those at initial diagnosis. For the remaining 2 patients with LS, cytogenetics were unavailable, but the leukemias were considered LS by the treating institution. KMT2A r rearrangement ( KMT2Ar ) was a predominant cytogenetic abnormality seen in patients with LS. Overall, 38 of 420 patients (9%) had a KMT2Ar . KMT2Ar was present in 9 of 12 (75%) patients with LS compared to 20 of 408 (7.1%) non-LS patients (p<0.001). Patients with LS were younger at initial diagnosis compared to the remaining cohort (median age, 1.6 years vs. 7.7 years; p=0.001), reflecting the inherent association between KMT2A r and infant ALL. Otherwise, there were no significant differences in gender, prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), prior blinatumomab exposure, or CAR response. Within the KMT2Ar cohort, 31 (81.6%) patients achieved a complete remission post-CAR. Eight of these patients received a consolidative HSCT (representing 4 first and 4 second HSCTs). No KMT2Ar patient experienced a post-HSCT LS and 3 are alive with a median follow-up of 1164 days post-CAR. In contrast, of the 23 KTM2Ar patients who did not receive HSCT post-CAR, 7 developed LS and 14 are alive with a median follow-up of 864 days post-CAR. Relative contraindications to post-CAR HSCT included a prior HSCT (n=11) or early LS (n=5). Of the 7 CAR non-responding patients with KMT2Ar , 2 (28.6%) had rapid emergence of LS by the first restaging timepoint. There are no long-term survivors following LS, regardless of KMT2A status, dying a median of 123 days (range, 36-594 days) after diagnosis of LS. The 6 SMNs were cholangiocarcinoma, synovial sarcoma, malignant melanoma and 3 therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (MDS/AML), distinguished from LS based on loss of original cytogenetics. Notably, 4/6 (67%) patients that developed a SMN had received an allogeneic HSCT prior to development of SMN. Four patients (67%) remain alive and in remission with a median follow-up of 304 days after diagnosis of SMN, including 2 patients with MDS/AML. Conclusions: In the largest series of pediatric patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy, we show that LS occurs in 2.9% of children. The presence of a KMT2A r was the biggest risk factor, with 23.7% of these patients experiencing LS. We found that LS can occur very early in a patient's post CAR T-cell course, and despite a variety of treatment approaches, the outcomes for these patients are dismal. Given the predisposition to LS, the role for consolidative HSCT in KMT2Ar patients warrants further study. Limited by a short follow-up period, we saw SMNs in only 1.4% of our patients. Causality is unknown and likely unrelated to CAR-T, but this further supports the long-term safety of CAR T-cells in children with B-ALL.
