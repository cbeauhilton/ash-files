    "abstract_text": "Human genetic studies identified HJV (also called HFE2 ) as the major cause for juvenile hemochromatosis (JH). Patients with HJV hemochromatosis have low urinary levels of hepcidin, the principal iron-regulatory hormone secreted by the liver. We attempted to establish the specific roles of HJV in iron metabolism, especially its relationship with hepcidin. Translation of the genomic sequence indicated a C-terminal GPI anchor for the protein product of HJV , hemojuvelin. This suggested that hemojuvelin may have either a soluble or a cell-associated form. In human hepatoma cell line Hep3B, knockdown of cellular HJV by siRNA decreased hepcidin expression, independently of the IL-6 pathway. Intriguingly, the addition of recombinant soluble hemojuvelin (rs-hemojuvelin) also suppressed hepcidin expression in primary human hepatocytes, in a log-linear dose-dependent manner, suggesting competition between soluble and cell-associated forms of hemojuvelin. Soluble hemojuvelin was found in human sera at concentrations similar to those required to suppress hepcidin mRNA in vitro . In cells engineered to express hemojuvelin, soluble hemojuvelin release was progressively inhibited by increasing iron or holotransferrin concentrations. Our study suggests that soluble and cell-associated hemojuvelin reciprocally regulate hepcidin mRNA levels, and that hemojuvelin may serve as a molecular messenger for iron homeostasis. Even in hepatocytes stimulated with IL-6, we observed strong suppression of hepcidin mRNA by rs-hemojuvelin. If rs-hemojuvelin or its active fragments also suppress hepcidin production in vivo , they could be used to alleviate anemia of inflammation.",
