    "abstract_text": "The main cause of morbidity and mortality of FA pts is bone marrow failure (BMF), which usually arises in the first decade of life and progresses to transfusion dependence and severe neutropenia. Androgen treatment has been recommended for FA pts with BMF for whom there is no acceptable hematopoietic stem cell transplant donor. Oxymetholone and Danazol are frequently used in these pts. We retrospectively analyzed data on 67 FA pts who received oxymetholone or danazol for the treatment of their BMF. The starting dose was approximately 1mg/kg for oxy and 2-4mg/kg for danazol. The hematological parameters at the initiation of treatment were hemoglobin (Hb) < 8 g/dL and/or thrombocytes < 30.000/\u03bcl. Patients were diagnosed between 01.2005 and 01.2016. The median age was 10.5 ys (2.9 - 40ys). Gender: 39M/27F. The median duration of treatment was 18m (3m - 95m). Fifty-three patients (79%) showed hematological response and became transfusion independence at a median of 3 months after beginning oxymetholone (2-9m) and 5 months after danazol (4-7m). Two adult pts treated with danazol achieved total hematological response with 2.5mg/kg. Seven pts are stable after tapering and stopping androgen with a median follow up of 4 ys (6m-8.5ys). Fourteen pts did not respond to treatment (21%). Eleven pts received an HSCT and seven are alive and well. Three pts were not transplanted and two are alive but transfusion dependent and one pt died from CNS bleeding. All patients developed variable degree of virilization but it was more evident with oxymetholone therapy. Older age at starting therapy was related to less virilization. Conclusion: This study shows the largest number of FA pts treated with androgen up till now. Androgen is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for FA pts who develop BMF with 79% of them showing transfusion free after 3-5 months. This response may give us time to search for better donors. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
