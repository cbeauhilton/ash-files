    "abstract_text": "Background: Thalidomide and its analogue lenalidomide have high response rates among patients with newly diagnosed as well as previously treated myeloma. Pomalidomide (CC4047) is the newest immunomodulatory (IMiD) agent that has shown single-agent activity in phase I studies. We report on the first Phase 2 trial of pomalidomide combined with low dose dexamethasone (Pom/dex) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Methods: 37 patients (21 male and 16 female) were enrolled. Pomalidomide was given orally 2 mg daily on days 1\u201328 of a 28-day cycle. Dexamethasone was given orally at a dose of 40 mg daily on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each cycle. Response was assessed by the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response criteria. All patients received aspirin 325 mg daily as prophylaxis against DVT. Results: The median age was 66 years (range, 40 \u2013 88). All patients were evaluable for response and toxicity, and all analysis were done on intent to treat basis. All patients had received prior therapy; 38% had 3 prior regimens; 35% had 2 prior regimens and 27% had one prior regimen. 76% had previous autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and 24% had 2 prior ASCT. 62% had previous IMiD therapy. Toxicity was mild and consisted primarily of myelosuppression. Grade 3 neutropenia occurred in 31%; grade 3 thrombocytopenia 3%; grade 3 anemia 3 %. Other grade 3/4 toxicities seen in less than 5% pts included: diarrhea, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, dehydration and renal insufficiency. 16 % had grade 1/2 neuropathy. No grade 3 neuropathy was seen and there have been no thromboembolic events. Thirty (81%) patients are continuing study treatment. Seven patients have discontinued treatment due to: disease progression (5), died on study (1) and the medical doctor\u2019s discretion (1). Twenty three of 37 patients (62%) achieved an objective response to therapy; including 9 (24%) with VGPR; 14 patients (38%) with PR; 6 (16%) with stable disease. Objective responses were seen in 4 of 13 patients (29%) who were refractory to lenalidomide. Conclusions: Pomalidomide plus dexamethasone (Pom/dex) is highly active and well tolerated for treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma with an objective responserate of 62%, including a 29% response rate among patients who are lenalidomiderefractory."
