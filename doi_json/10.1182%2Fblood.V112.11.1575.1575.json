    "abstract_text": "Elderly patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) do not take benefit from dose-intensive chemotherapy such as HyperCVAD because of its high toxicity (Romaguera JCO 2005). Prior Goelams clinical trials using the VAD plus Chlorambucil regimen with or without Rituximab have demonstrated a good efficacy/toxicity ratio in front line therapy (EHA 2008, a0259). Proteasome inhibitors are among the most promising new agents for relapsing patients (Fisher, JCO 2006). Therefore, the GOELAMS conducted a phase II clinical trial including Velcade plus R-AD and Chlorambucil (RiPAD + Chlorambucil) for elderly MCL patients upfront. Aims : To evaluate toxicity and overall response rate after 4 cycles of RiPAD + Chlorambucil regimen. Protocol : RiPAD + C: R ituximab 375 mg/sqm, D1 (and D8 for cycle 1); P S 341, Velcade 1.3 mg/sqm D1, 4, 8 and 11; A driblastine 9mg/sqm/D in a 4 days continuous infusion; D examethasone 20 mgx2/D for D1 to D4; C hlorambucil 12 mg/D, D20 to D29. One cycles every 35 D. The patients received a maximum of 6 cycles. Inclusion criteria : Untreated MCL patients (from 65 to 80 years) with a stage II to IV disease, and good PS (Ecog < 3). Response criteria is evaluated according to the 1999 Cheson\u2019s criteria, all patients were also evaluated by FDG-PETscan. Results : since June 2007, 27 patients have been included. Thirteen have been evaluable after 4 cycles. Median age is 71 years (66\u201380 y). After 4 cycles, disease Status was: 10 patients in response (3 in CR with negative FDG-PETscan and 7 in PR including 3 with a negative PETscan) and 3 patients progressed on therapy. The 3 non responding patients had the highest Ki67 value over 30%. Toxicity evaluation has been evaluated based on 59 cycles. Grade 3\u20134 toxicities have been reported in 5 cases (2 neurologic, 1 hepatic, 1 cardiac and 1 pulmonary). Only 3 cycles were delayed because of toxic reasons. Conclusion : this intermediaire analysis shows an ORR of 77% (10/13) including 6 patients with a negative FDG-PET after only 4 cycles. Our study demonstrates that the RiPAD+C regimen has a good efficacy/toxicity ratio and is a promising therapeutic option for MCL elderly patients. The study is ongoing and additional results on response rate and toxicity will be updated for presentation in the ASH meeting."
