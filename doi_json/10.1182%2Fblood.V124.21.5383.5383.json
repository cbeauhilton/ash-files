    "abstract_text": "Background: In lymphoma patients, it is believed that serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) reflects the tumor mass and that soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) is indicative of activated T-cell reaction. Although it is important to characterize the pattern of LDH and sIL-2R in each subtype of lymphoma, limited information is available on this topic. We investigated LDH and sIL-2R in patients with representative subtypes of lymphoma. Patients and Methods: In the Yokohama City University Hematology Group Lymphoma Database, 3,484 untreated patients were registered between 1996 and 2014. We extracted the data of 3,005 patients with the 8 following subtypes: follicular lymphoma (FL), mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALT), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Burkitt lymphoma (BL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), and extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (ENKL). In this retrospective study, we included 2,889 patients in whom both LDH and sIL-2R were recorded. We used the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare LDH and to compare sIL-2R in all 8 subtypes. Each subtype was compared using the Dwass, Steel, Critchlow-Fligner test (multiple comparison test). Results: The 2,889 patients consisted of 1,630 men and 1,259 women, with a median age of 65 years (range, 15-95 years). The median LDH was 1.0 x upper normal limit (N) (range, 0.1 N\u201353.9 N). The median sIL-2R was 1,150 U/ml (range, 53-142,000 U/ml). The distribution of lymphoma subtypes was as follows: 584 FL (20%), 219 MALT (8%), 82 MCL (3%), 1,579 DLBCL (54%), 39 BL (1%), 162 HL (6%), 162 PTCL (6%), and 62 ENKL (2%). Overall, LDH as well as sIL-2R showed significant difference in the 8 subtypes ( P < .0001 for both). The median values of LDH and sIL-2R in each subtype were as follows: 0.9 N and 1,114 U/ml in FL, 0.8 N and 467 U/ml in MALT, 1.15 N and 4,460 U/ml in MCL, 1.1 N and 1,230 U/ml in DLBCL, 2.4 N and 1,700 in BL, 1.0 N and 1,460 U/ml in HL, 1.2 N and 3,193 U/ml in PTCL, and 1.0 N and 679 U/ml in ENKL, respectively. In LDH analysis, BL showed higher value than any other subtypes and MALT showed lower value than any other subtypes. In sIL-2R analysis, MCL showed a higher value than any other B-cell lymphomas, except for BL, and MALT showed lower value than any other subtypes. In the comparison of the most frequent subtypes of FL and DLBCL, LDH was significantly higher in DLBCL ( P < .0001); however, sIL-2R was not significantly different ( P = 0.31). The correlation between LDH and sIL-2R in each subtype was depicted in the Figure. The diameter of the circle indicated the number of patients. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that the tumor mass was greatest in BL and that T-cell reaction was greater in MCL. Furthermore, both tumor mass and T-cell reaction were lowest in MALT.
