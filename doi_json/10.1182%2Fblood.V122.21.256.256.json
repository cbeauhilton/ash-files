    "abstract_text": "We have previously demonstrated that the degree of in vivo kinase inhibition achieved over the first month of imatinib therapy in newly diagnosed, chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (CP-CML) patients, is an excellent predictor of subsequent molecular response. Patients achieving >50% in vivo kinase inhibition all achieved major molecular response (MMR; \u22640.1% BCR-ABL1 (IS)) by 24 months compared to 56% of patients with <50% in vivo kinase inhibition ( p<0.001 ). (White et al JCO 2007). To date, no biomarker which accurately predicts response to nilotinib has been reported. Achievement of <10% BCR-ABL1 by 3 months (EMR) is predictive of subsequent molecular outcome in imatinib treated patients. Only 1 of the 70 CP-CML recipients of first-line nilotinib (300mg bid) monitored in Adelaide failed to achieve <10% by 3 months, and this patient withdrew from treatment due to toxicity 7 months after the start of nilotinib therapy. Failure to achieve <1% BCR-ABL1 (EMR 1%) by 3 months was strongly associated with a significantly lower rate of MMR by 12 months when compared to patients achieving <1% BCR-ABL in the 65 of 70 patients with molecular response data examinable at 12 months. (55% MMR (n=11) vs 93% MMR (n=54) p=0.002 ). The degree of in vivo kinase inhibition was measured by calculating the % reduction in the p-Crkl level of mononuclear cells collected at days 7 and 29 after the start of nilotinib therapy. A significantly higher proportion of nilotinib treated patients achieved 50% or greater in vivo kinase inhibition over the first month of treatment compared to our historical cohort of imatinib treated patients (75% vs 45% of patients. p<0.001). Dividing patients into those with low and those with high in vivo kinase inhibition revealed a significantly higher proportion of nilotinib treated patients with high in vivo kinase inhibition achieved EMR1% ( p=0.012 ) and MMR by 12 months when compared to patients with low in vivo kinase inhibition ( p<0.001) Table 1 .

In contrast, while dose is clearly important for imatinib other factors, such as variable drug influx also play a pivotal role. Previous studies have demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of nilotinib are similar to that of imatinib, and that trough plasma levels of imatinib >1000ng/ml are associated with a higher rate of MMR. Grouping patients into those 1000ng/ml revealed that early trough nilotinib plasma levels were also strongly predictive of the achievement of MMR by 12 mo (1000ng/ml \u2013 96% (n=25). p=0.009 ). Of note two patients have developed kinase domain mutations and both patients failed to achieve high in vivo kinase inhibition or drug levels >1000ng/ml. Preliminary analysis of this cohort of nilotinib treated patients strongly suggests that the in vivo kinase inhibition achieved is significantly higher than observed with imatinib at equivalent timepoints, and is a significant factor for subsequent molecular response. Importantly the plasma levels achieved over the first month of nilotinib therapy appear to be a key factor in the achievement of both early in vivo kinase inhibition and subsequent molecular response.
