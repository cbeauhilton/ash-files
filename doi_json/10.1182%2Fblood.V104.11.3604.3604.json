    "article_date": "November 16, 2004",
    "session_type": "Poster Sessions",
    "abstract_text": "Several recent studies have suggested that bone marrow (BM) cells can contribute to non-hematopoietic cell lineages through cell fusion rather than transdiffentiation. As this phenomenon has been observed in multiple organs, including the brain and heart, without prior infliction of organ-specific insults, it has been proposed that BM cells might contribute to replacement of non-hematopoietic cell lineages during steady state, and that BM transplantation might be developed as a therapeutic modality in diseases of these organs. However, as all observations of BM-derived cell fusion in vivo have been made in lethally irradiated mice reconstituted with genetically marked BM cells, we addressed to what degree cell fusion occurs normally and/or in response to whole body irradiation. To be able to distinguish between these possibilities we used c-kit deficient (w 41 /w 41 ) mice, which unlike wild type mice do not require irradiation-induced myeloablation to facilitate reconstitution of transplanted BM cells. Noteworthy, no BM-derived cell fusion events were observed in the brain (purkinje neurons) or heart (cardiomyocytes) when unconditioned w 41 /w 41 mice were reconstituted with beta actin GFP transgenic BM cells. In striking contrast, following whole body irradiation (875 rad), BM-derived cell fusion was observed in recipient cardiomyocytes and purkinje neurons of all BM transplanted mice. Thus, spontaneous adult BM-derived cell fusion does not occur in steady state but is potently facilitated by irradiation-induced injuries to the organs in which cell fusion occurs.",
