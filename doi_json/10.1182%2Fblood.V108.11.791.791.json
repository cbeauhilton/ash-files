    "article_date": "November 16, 2006",
    "session_type": "Oral Sessions",
    "abstract_text": "Between 1995 and 2004, two NIH-sponsored studies (STOP/STOP II) showed that children with sickle cell disease (SCD) and abnormal transcranial Doppler blood flow measurements (high stroke risk) are protected from stroke with regular blood transfusions. Iron overload, which may lead to complications and requires iron removal therapy, was monitored by serum ferritin (SF). Liver iron concentration (LIC) measurement was not mandated by protocol and was performed at investigator discretion. Biopsy dates and lab values were captured during STOP/STOP II, providing an opportunity to validate SF against LIC. 75 LICs on 36 patients (19 female, 17 male) at 8 centers were obtained. No liver biopsy complications were reported. LICs were correlated with STOP/STOP II core laboratory SF and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) obtained within 180 days of LICs. Median age at first biopsy was 11.1 years (range, 4.5\u201317.8), median time from start of transfusion was 36 months (range, 2\u2013100). Iron removal treatment was initiated a median 23 months (range, 4\u2013108) from start of transfusion, with deferoxamine (n=27), and/or exchange transfusion (n=9). 21 pts (58%) had multiple LIC measures: 2 (n=9), 3 (n=8), 4 (n=2), 5 (n=2). Last LICs on iron removal therapy were obtained a median 72 months (range, 35\u2013124) from start of transfusion. Correlation between SFs and LICs were r=-0.06 (n=18) for first LICs obtained prior to iron removal therapy, r=0.50 (n=17) for last LICs obtained on iron removal therapy, and r=0.51 for all LICs (n=60). Pts with single/last LIC >=15 mg/gram dry liver were significantly more likely to have ALTs >=45 IU/L compared to those with LICs =15 mg/gram and ALT >=45 IU/L tended to have higher SFs then those with normal ALT (mean SF 4927 ng/ml, 95% CI 1739\u20138115 vs. mean SF 2255 ng/ml, 95% CI 1599\u20132912). 37% (7/19) of pts with LIC >=15 mg/gram had SFs <2000 ng/ml. 55% (11/20) of pts with repeated LICs, had last LICs <15 mg/gram after initiation of iron removal therapy. SF did not correlate with LICs after initiation of blood transfusion therapy and correlated weakly after initiation of iron removal therapy. Over 1/3 of children with evidence of significant iron overload, as measured by LICs, had low serum SFs (<2000 ng/ml), leading to a potentially erroneous interpretation of low iron stores. A significant portion of pts with elevated LICs had evidence of liver injury (ALT elevation). SF elevation observed in some pts may be due in part to end organ injury. Sustained iron overload control was achieved in over 1/2 of pts examined with repeated LICs.",
