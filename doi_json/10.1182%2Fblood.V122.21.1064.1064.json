    "abstract_text": "Adenosine is an important regulatory metabolite which attenuates inflammation when it binds and activates the adenosine A 2A receptor subtype on immune cells. However, the effect of adenosine on inflammatory responses in endothelial cells is mostly unknown. Thrombin as a known pro-inflammatory protease is involved in a variety of pathophysiological processes associated with inflammation in stimulated endothelial cells. The present study investigated the effect of adenosine on thrombin-mediated modulation of pro-inflammatory responses in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Adenosine, in a concentration-dependent manner (1-100\u00b5M), inhibited the barrier disruptive effect of thrombin (20nM) on endothelial monolayer. The expression level of adenosine receptors, A 1 , A 2A , A 2B and A 3 was examined in HUVECs and it was found that A 2A and A 2B are the highest expressing receptors among the four subtypes (A 2B > A 2A >A 1 >A 3 ) in endothelial cells. Further studies revealed that the barrier protective effect of adenosine on thrombin-induced hyperpermeability in HUVECs was abrogated by the A 2A receptor specific siRNA or the A 2A receptor specific antagonist, ZM-241385, but not by siRNAs targeting the other adenosine receptor subtypes. To further determine the molecular mechanisms of the barrier protective effect of adenosine, its effect on thrombin-induced RhoA activation was assessed. Pretreatment of endothelial cells with adenosine prevented both thrombin-induced RhoA activation (Rho-GTP) and its membrane translocation as evidenced by cell fractionation and Pull-down assays, respectively. Moreover, preincubation of endothelial cells with adenosine down-regulated the expression of cell surface adhesion molecules (VCAM-1 and ICAM-1) and thrombin-mediated activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) pathway. Adenosine also inhibited secretion of the early chemokine, MCP-1, and the late-acting pro-inflammatory cytokine, HMGB-1, by thrombin-stimulated endothelial cells. Taken together, these results suggest that adenosine can inhibit pro-inflammatory thrombin signaling responses in endothelial cells by specifically activating the A 2A receptor subtype, thereby protecting endothelium during the activation of coagulation and inflammatory pathways.
