    "abstract_text": "Etoposide (E), methylprednisolone (S), high-dose cytarabine (HA), and cisplatin (P) (ESHAP) combination is commonly used salvage regimen for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL). Oxaliplatin (Ox), a new platinum derivative, showed substantially different cytotoxic activity and adverse effects from both cisplatin and carboplatin. In addition, single-agent oxaliplatin was reportedly active in patients with NHL. We conducted to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of ESHAOx combination, substituting oxaliplatin for cisplatin in ESHAP combination, for relapsed/refractory aggressive NHL patients. Main eligibility criteria included aggressive NHL and failure to achieve a complete remission or recurrent disease after previous chemotherapy. ESHAOx consisted of E, 40 mg/m 2 on days 1 to 4; S, 500 mg on days 1 to 5; HA, 2 g/m 2 on day 5; and Ox, 130 mg/m 2 on day 1, every 3 weeks. Eligible patients were scheduled to receive a maximum of 6 cycles, and high dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell rescue allowed. Responses were evaluated every 3 cycles. All patients gave written informed consent before study entry. Between May 2006 and January 2007, 27 patients were enrolled. Nineteen (70%) patients with relapsed, 8 patients with refractory, and 10 (37%) patients with IPI 3\u20135 were included in this study. A total of 102 cycles were administered for a median number of 4 (range 1\u20136 cycles) per patient. There were 8 (30%) complete responses and 9 (33%) partial responses, producing an overall response rate of 63% (95% CI, 45\u201381%). Most common grade 3/4 toxicity of the courses was myelosuppression with including neutropenia (55%) and thrombocytopenia (33%). Non-hematologic toxicity was very favorable. No significant renal and neurotoxicity was demonstrated. There was one treatment-related death due to neutropenic sepsis. The results of ESHAOx combination showed highly antitumor activity and favorable toxicity profile, suggesting it can be used as salvage regimen for relapsed/refractory aggressive NHL patients.",
