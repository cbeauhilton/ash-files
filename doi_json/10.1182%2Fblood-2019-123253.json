    "abstract_text": "We present the largest to date of a case series of nine patients with hematological and oncological malignancies who were infected with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS-CoV is a novel beta-coronavirus with a high fatality rate in comorbid patients. The majority of MERS cases globally were reported from Saudi Arabia (1983 cases, including 745 related deaths with a case-fatality rate of 37.5%) according to the WHO update of February 2019. All were clinically stable before acquiring the virus. Most of the cases had an active disease as relapse or refractory with three cases being neutropenic. The clinical presentation and radiological features of the patients were variable and inconsistent (Table 1). Diagnosis was confirmed with RT-PCR assays targeting upstream of the E gene and the open-reading frame gene 1a which had to be done repeatedly and required an average of 3 (with max. of 7) samples for a test to be positive (Table 2). All the patients developed respiratory failure, were admitted to the critical care unit (ICU) and required mechanical ventilation. The length of hospital stay ranged from 15 - 48, with an average of 24 days. Unfortunately, all nine patients died within days after admission to the ICU. In addition, the time from diagnosis to death has an average of 9 days ranging from 2-24 days, respectively. In conclusion, MERS CoV infection in hematology/oncology patients has a very poor prognosis regardless of the status of the underlying disease. The clinical presentation is not distinctive and confirming the diagnosis requires numerous respiratory samples. Measures to prevent nosocomial outbreaks should include proper compliance with personal protection equipment by health-care workers when managing patients with suspected and confirmed MERS-CoV infection and prompt isolation of infected patients. Future research is required to enhance our understanding of the disease and to evaluate superior diagnostic and therapeutic options.
