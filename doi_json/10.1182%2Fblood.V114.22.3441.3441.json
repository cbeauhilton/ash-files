    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3441 Poster Board III-329 Background CLL is characterized by the progressive accumulation of monoclonal B lymphocytes. One theory to explain how CLL cells avoid elimination through immune surveillance mechanisms is through a defect in the ability of T-cells to form immunological synapses with antigen-presenting tumor B-cells (Ramsay et al JCI 2008). Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with clinical activity in the treatment of B-cell malignancies. Recent laboratory studies showed that lenalidomide not only stimulates T- and natural killer (NK)-cell-mediated ADCC, it also restores the T-cell-mediated ability to form immunological synapses with CLL tumor cells. Since NK cells also exert cytotoxicity through immune synapse formation, here we explore how lenalidomide affects NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity mechanisms and whether this activity is altered in the presence of rituximab since published studies showed that lenalidomide-pretreated B-cells have a down-regulated surface CD20 expression. Further, we investigated the molecular events associated with immune synapse formation and the effect of lenalidomide. Methods Immune synapse formation was assessed in NK cells (from healthy donors PBMCs) co-cultured with either B-CLL cells derived from pts or with K562 cells (positive control). Cells were fixed and the ability to form synapses was assessed via immunohistochemisty co-staining for either F-actin and CD2, or F-actin and perforin (a cytolytic protein found in NK cells). Synapse formation was visualized by microscopy and measured via relative mean fluorescent intensity. Activity of RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42 were measured using Rho GTPases assay kits. Inhibition of lenalidomide-mediated immune synapse activity was assayed using the cell permeable Rho inhibitor C3 (0.5 mM). Flow cytometry was used to measure changes in surface CD20 and CD54 (ICAM-1) expression in B-CLL samples from 3 pts after treatment with lenalidomide. Results Lenalidomide induced the formation of immunological synapses between NK cells and primary B-CLL cells (p<.01) or the K562 cell line. Lenalidomide activated NK cells regardless of the presence of target cells, as measured by F-actin and perforin staining. RhoA and Rac1 were activated at the immunological synapse in the presence of lenalidomide. Inhibition of RhoA by the C3 inhibitor blocked F-actin localization, as well as perforin accumulation induced by lenalidomide at cell-cell contact sites, indicating inhibition of immune synapses and the associated cytolytic activity. This was also observed with Rac1 inhibition, but to a lesser degree than with RhoA inhibition. Functionality of formed synapses was confirmed by co-localization of F-actin and perforin at the synapse sites. 3 CLL pt samples treated ex vivo with lenalidomide demonstrated variable changes in CD20 expression: a 20-30% decrease in CD20 expression was observed in 2 B-CLL pt samples, whereas CD20 levels remained unchanged in the third. In the presence of rituximab, lenalidomide-induced synapse formation between NK cells and B-cells from CLL patients was further enhanced. This was accompanied by upregulation of costimulatory and adhesion molecule CD54 on B-CLL cells suggesting increased antigen presentation, which might contribute to the increased synapse formation. Conclusion Lenalidomide can directly activate NK-cell-mediated anti-tumor activity through enhanced formation of immune synapses via the regulation of Rho and Rac1 GTPases and the cytoskeleton. Despite some down-modulation of CD20 expression in lenalidomide-pretreated B-CLL cells, the immune synapse activity increases when lenalidomide is combined with rituximab suggesting that combining lenalidomide and anti-CD20 antibodies warrants exploration in the CLL clinical setting.
