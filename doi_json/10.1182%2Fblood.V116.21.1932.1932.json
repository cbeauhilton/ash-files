    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1932 Background: Most MM develops through an asymptomatic precursor stage. Current analyses understanding the risk of progression to clinical MM are based on limited set of variables. In 2002, South West Oncology Group (SWOG) began a prospective observational clinical trial of patients with asymptomatic plasmaproliferative disorders (PCD) to evaluate clinical, imaging, genetic and immunologic features predictive of disease progression. Patients and Methods: All patients with asymptomatic PCD underwent detailed staging evaluation at study entry and were prospectively followed at 3\u20136 month intervals until disease progression requiring therapy. Data from clinical features at baseline were evaluated to assess the risk for progression to clinical MM (P-MM). Results: Between 11/2002 and 4/2010, 230 patients have been enrolled, of whom 140 were deemed to have smoldering MM (SMM) and 90 monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), based on international myeloma working group criteria. The two groups differed in terms of abnormal serum free light chain ratio (FLCR; SMM: 79%, MGUS: 52%; p=3.5mg/L, albumin 8mg/L or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Among 13 variables potentially linked to P-MM, baseline B2M >=3.5mg/L, baseline serum albumin 8 mg/dL, abnormal FLCR and low levels of uninvolved Ig were all associated with greater propensity of P-MM on univariate analysis. However upon multivariate analysis, abnormal serum FLCR and SMM disease type were the only surviving adverse variables predictive of disease progression. Conclusions: These data demonstrate in the context of a large prospective multicenter trial that abnormal FLCR is a dominant predictor of clinical malignancy in asymptomatic PCD. These findings support the need to understand the biology of abnormal FLCR and incorporate novel criteria based on imaging, genetics and host response.
