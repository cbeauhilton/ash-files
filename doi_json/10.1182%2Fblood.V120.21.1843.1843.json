    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1843 Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of plasma cells and the second most common blood cancer. Current treatment strategies such as high dose chemotherapy, autologous stem cell rescue, and allogeneic transplantation have improved response rates and increased survival. However, these treatments often include high procedure-related morbidity and mortality and can only be applied to a small minority of myeloma patients. Therefore, safe broadly applicable immunologic strategies for myeloma, such as Adoptive Cell Therapy (ACT) are urgently needed. Methods: In this study we focused on aHLA-A*0201-restricted cancer testis antigen MAGE-A3:112\u2013120, which is widely expressed in many forms of cancers such as metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and MM, but not expressed in most normal tissues. To develop a system of effective strategies for T-cell therapy of multiple myeloma, we employed T-cell engineering technology using a MAGE-A3specific T-cell receptor (TCR)obtained from Dr. Steven Rosenberg at the National Cancer Institute. MAGE-A3 specific TCR was sub-cloned into a lentiviral vector and tranduced into purified CD8+ T-cells from human peripheral blood mononucleocytes (hPBMCs). To test the effector functionality of the MAGE-A3 specific TCR, the MAGE-A3 TCR-transduced CD8+ T-cells were subjected to cytokine release and chromium release assays after being co-cultured with MAGE-A3 peptide-loaded T2 cells, and U266 (MAGE-A3+/HLA-A*0201+), MM1.r (MAGE-A3+/HLA-A*0201-), KAS6 (MAGE-A3-/HLA-A*0201+), and KMS11(MAGE-A3-/HLA-A*0201-) MM tumor cell lines. Results: We observedcytokine production of INF-g and IL-2 in the MAGE-A3 TCR-transduced CD8+ T-cells generally in a dose-dependent manner to the MAGE-A3 peptide-loaded T2 cells. For example, the difference of INF-g secretion bythe MAGE-A3 TCR-transduced CD8+ T-cells wasa 10-fold increase from 0.001 uM to 0.02 uM of the loaded MAGE-A3 peptide. IL-2 secretion was also increasedby 7-fold from 0.001 uM to 0.1 uM of the MAGE-A3 peptide concentration. At 10uM of the peptide concentration, there was a 29-fold increase of the IL-2 production as compared to the 0.001 uM peptide concentration. Between 10uM and 100 uMof the peptide concentration, there was a decrease in IL-2 secretion by 2-fold, which is commonly observed at high peptide concentrations presumably due to cytotoxicity. Specific lysis of tumor cells by the MAGE-A3 TCR-transduced CD8+ T-cellswas observed in all four MM tumor cell lines, and we detected higher percentage of cell lysisin U266 (38%) and MM1.r (51%) cell lines as compared to the KAS6 (11%) and KMS11(21%) cell lines. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the MAGE-A3 TCR-engineered CD 8+ T-cells are able to specifically recognize MAGE-A3 antigen, produce IL-2 and IFN-g, and destroy MM tumor cells loaded with the MAGE-A3 antigen. This potentially could further translate into effective MAGE-A3 specific targeted tumor rejection in vivo. We also plan to transduce the MAGE-A3 TCR into hematopoietic stem cells to and test the effector function of those cells against MM tumor cells and eventually against MM patient samples.
