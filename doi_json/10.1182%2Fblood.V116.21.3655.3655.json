    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3655 Acquired inhibitors of coagulation are bleeding disorders that require prompt recognition, diagnosis, and management. Antibodies against factor VII are extremely rare with only a few cases reported in the literature. We present a case of a patient with an acquired Factor VII inhibitor. This is an 87 year old female with a past medical history of breast cancer, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented to the emergency room with right flank pain and hematuria. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed bilateral hydronephrosis with no evidence of nephrolithiasis. The patient denied hematemesis or hematochezia but was noted to have hemoccult positive stools. The patient denied any anticoagulant use. Admission laboratories revealed a coagulopathy with a normal partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 28 seconds and prolonged prothrombin time (PT) of greater than 50 seconds and INR of 19.59. The patient received vitamin K without improvement in coagulation parameters. A mixing study revealed a markedly prolonged PT that did not correct with 1:1 (18.9 seconds) and 4:1 (27.3 seconds) mix normal plasma. Factor assays shows an abnormal Factor VII level of less than 1%, and normal Factor II 121%, Factor V 140%, Factor VIII 201%, Factor IX 99%, and Factor XI 126% levels. A FVII inhibitor was 1.66 Bethesda units per milliliter. Immunosuppressive treatment was initiated with prednisone 1 milligram per kilogram daily and cyclophosphamide 200 milligrams daily. Factor VII levels normalized without evidence of inhibitor. The patient clinically improved and immunosuppressive medications were gradually tapered off. This case emphasizes the importance of prompt recognition in a patient with a rare acquired inhibitor of coagulation. Treatment with immunosuppressive therapy consisting of corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide resulted in normalization of factor VII levels and resolution of bleeding symptoms and should be considered as first-line management for such patients.
