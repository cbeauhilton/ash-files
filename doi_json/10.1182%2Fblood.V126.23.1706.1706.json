    "abstract_text": "Background. CD49d, the alpha-chain of the integrin heterodimer VLA-4, has been identified among the strongest predictors of overall survival (OS) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), along with IGHV mutational status and deletion of the 17p (17p-) chromosome involving TP53 (Bulian et al, JCO, 2014). In addition to TP53 , the clinical relevance of NOTCH1 , SF3B1 and BIRC3 gene mutations has been recently emphasized. Aim. To test the relevance of CD49d in molecular subgroups of CLL defined by NOTCH1 , SF3B1 and BIRC3 gene mutations. Methods. The study was based on a cohort of 778 unselected CLL (422 untreated and 356 treated cases) all characterized for CD49d expression (CD49d high , \u226530% positive cells by flow cytometry in 229 cases), IGHV mutational status (unmutated, UM, in 262 cases), karyotype abnormalities according to the hierarchical stratification (13q- in 308 cases, +12 in 103 cases, 11q- in 64 cases), tested at diagnosis, along with mutations/deletions (hereinafter, disruption) of TP53 (disrupted in 84 cases, including 58 cases with 17p-), BIRC3 (disrupted in 59 cases), and mutationsof NOTCH1 (mutated in 81 cases), SF3B1 (mutated in 54 cases)tested at diagnosis in 65% of cases, in all cases before therapy. Chromosome abnormalities by FISH were defined by using a 5% cut-off; IGHV , TP53 , BIRC3 , NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations were investigated by Sanger sequencing. Median follow-up of patients was 80 months with 173 deaths. Results. i) association with CD49d: a CD49d high phenotype associated with age \u226565 years (p=0.0001), Rai stage I or higher (p>0.0001), UM IGHV status (p>0.0001), absence of 13q- (p=0.0001), presence of +12 (p<0.0001), presence of NOTCH1 mutations (p<0.0001). ii ) CD49d prognostic impact: in univariate analysis, the following covariates had a significant impact on OS: age \u226565 years (hazard ratio/confidence interval (HR/CI)= 3.98/2.77-5.73; p<0.0001), Rai stage I or higher (HR/CI=1.81/1.33-2.46; p=0.0002), high CD49d expression (HR/CI=2.62/1.94-3.54; p<0.0001), UM IGHV status (HR/CI=3.03/2.24-4.10; p<0.0001), presence of 13q- (HR/CI=0.52/0.37-0.71; p=0.0001), +12 (HR/CI=1.59/1.08-2.33; p=0.0183), 11q- (HR/CI=2.16/1.42-3.30; p=0.0004), NOTCH1 mutations (HR/CI=2.66/1.82-3.88; p<0.0001), SF3B1 mutations (HR/CI=1.99/1.24-3.20; p=0.0048), BIRC3 disruption (HR/CI=2.41/1.58-3.68; p<0.0001), TP53 disruption (HR/CI=3.23/2.28-4.57; p<0.0001). In a multivariate analysis model including all these variables, high CD49d expression (HR/CI=1.76/1.28-2.42; p=0.0006), UM IGHV status (HR/CI=2.21/1.58-3.09; p<0.0001), presence of 11q- (HR/CI=2.11/1.35-3.31; p=0.0011), TP53 disruption (HR/CI=2.93/2.04-4.22; p<0.0001), and NOTCH1 mutations (HR/CI=1.76/1.16-2.67; p=0.0082) emerged as independent prognosticators, along with age \u226565 years (HR/CI=3.73/2.58-5.39; p<0.0001). iii ) CD49d prognostic impact using the integrated hierarchical mutational/cytogenetic model: by integrating gene mutations and cytogenetic aberrations according to Rossi et al (Blood, 2013), a multivariate analysis model was applied with the following covariates: age, CD49d, IGHV status, TP53/BIRC3 disruption, NOTCH1 mutations /SF3B1 mutations/11q-, normal karyotype/+12, 13q-. Again, CD49d high phenotype (HR/CI=1.88/1.38-2.54; p=0.0001), UM IGHV status (HR/CI=2.16/1.54-3.01; p<0.0001), presence of NOTCH1 mutations /SF3B1 mutations/11q- (HR/CI=1.62/1.11-2.38; p=0.0139), and of TP53/BIRC3 disruption (HR/CI=2.67/1.92-3.70; p<0.0001) retained their independent prognostic impact, along with age \u226565 years (HR/CI=3.58/2.28-5.17; p<0.0001). Notably, CD49d high CLL patients experienced shorter OS than the CD49d low cases in the context of each mutational/cytogenetic group ( TP53/BIRC3 disruption, p=0.0064; NOTCH1 mutations /SF3B1 mutations/11q-, p=0.05; normal karyotype/+12, p=0.0153; 13q-, p=0.0126; see Figure). Conclusion. CD49d was confirmed as independent negative OS prognosticator in CLL also when the novel recurrent alterations of NOTCH1 , BIRC3 , and SF3B1 genes were considered. In this setting, TP53 disruption and NOTCH1 mutations remained independent OS prognosticators, allegedly for their physiopathological roles in CLL cell immuno-chemoresistance. Figure 1.
