    "abstract_text": "Casein kinase I (CKI) \u03b5 is involved in cytokine-induced hematopoietic cell differentiation by directly interacting with the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and/or \u03b2-catenin. Here, we show that CKI\u03b5 plays an important role in hematopoietic cell survival through modifying Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling. Introduction of wild-type (WT)-CKI\u03b5 into murine interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent myeloid progenitor 32D cells increased the sensitivity to genotoxic stress, such as \u03b3-irradiation, anti-cancer drug and cytokine-deprivation, whereas kinase-negative (KN)-CKI\u03b5 suppressed it. While IL-3-induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 was sustained by KN-CKI\u03b5, it was attenuated by WT-CKI\u03b5. Similarly, in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells, the increase of phosphorylated Akt induced by all-trans retinoic acid was accompanied by the decrease of CKI\u03b5 expression. A specific inhibitor for CKI\u03b5, CKI-7 also increased the phospho-Akt as well as phospho-PTEN (Ser380/Thr382/383; an inactive form of PTEN). Functional expression of CKI\u03b5 activated PTEN by their physical association, following the decrease of phospho-Akt. The present studies suggest that the expression of CKI\u03b5 downregulates PI3K/Akt signaling through PTEN, increasing the sensitivity to apoptotic signals. Taken together with the fact that CKI\u03b5 is ubiquitously expressed in normal hematopoietic cells, CKI\u03b5 might be critical for prevention against genotoxic stress-induced leukomogenesis. In other words, CKI\u03b5 could be a candidate of the tumor suppressor in hematological malignancies as well as cancer.",
