    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3747 Poster Board III-683 Background despite the prognosis of aggressive non-Hodgkin Lymphoma has considerably improved over the past decades, the treatment of elderly patients with NHL is still a difficult challenge for the clinician. A retrospective EORTC study conducted in patients with aggressive NHL and age above 70 years showed that about half of patients received an aggressive treatment and that only 15% of investigators employed full-dose regimens from the first cycle. We here present the preliminary data of CHOP-like regimen delivered as first-line or salvage therapy to elderly or young patients with NHL and not eligible for more aggressive therapy. Patients and methods from July 2006 to January 2009, 27 pts (M/F:11/16) with a median age of 71 years (range: 53-84) were included in the study. Twenty-four pts (88%) were more than 65 yo, 18 (66%) had high-grade and 9 (34%) an indolent lymphoma. Stage III-IV disease according to Ann Arbor staging occurred in 18 pts (66%) whereas aaIPI, evaluated only for pts with aggressive NHL, was 3 2 in 9 pts (18%). ENS involvement \u2265 1 was present in 11 (41%) and BM involvement in 13 pts (48%). Most of pts (60%) had ECOG PS \u2265 1. Twenty out of 27 pts (74%) received COMP\u00b1R as first-line treatment and 7 (26%) as salvage therapy; all but one of pre-treated pts had received more than 1 line of chemotherapy (range 2-4). Twenty-five (92%) pts had co-morbidity with more than 1 disease in 44% of cases. Median LVEF was 59% (range: 35-80%). COMP\u00b1R regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 IV d1, vincristine 1.4 mg/m 2 IV d1 (capped at 2mg), liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin (Myocet O\u0300 ) at the dose of 50 mg/m 2 IV d1 and Prednisone 100 mg/die PO d 1-5 with or without Rituximab at dose of 375 mg/m 2 d8 at first course and at d1 of subsequent courses according to B or T-cell lymphoma phenotype respectively. To pts with early stage disease were planned 4 courses of COMP\u00b1R\u00b1IF-RT while those with advanced stage of disease received six courses of chemotherapy delivered every 3 weeks. Median number of cycles delivered was 5.6 (range: 4-8). All patients completed the planned treatment and most of them (92%) received G-CSF at dose of 300 mg/die as primary (67%) or secondary (25%) prophylaxis. ESA support was need in 8 pts (30%). Results complete response (CR) was achieved in 21 (78%) and partial response (PR) in 3 (11%) of pts with an ORR of 89%; three pts had stable (n=2) or progressive disease (n=1). The regimen was safe and well tolerated with dose reduction occurring in 9 pts (34%). None of pts developed cardiac toxicity. The mainly adverse events recorded was neutropenia occurring in 15% of pts and febrile neutropenia in 6 pts (23%). Extra-haematological toxicity was mild (WHO grade 1-2) and recorded in 18% of pts. There was no treatment-related fatal toxicity. With a median follow-up of 15 months (range 6-33) the OS and EFS was 93% and 89% respectively. Conclusion COMP\u00b1R regimen shows to be safe and effective in a group of elderly patients both as first line or salvage therapy. However more patients and longer follow-up is required to assess definitively the role of this regimen in elderly patients with untreated aggressive NHL. A prospective phase II trial is ongoing at our Institution. Tab. 1 Response According to Histology  . DLBCL (n=12) . MZL (n=6) . MCL (n=3) . PTCL (n=3) . FL (n=2) . B-CLL (n=1) .
