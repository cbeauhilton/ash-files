    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2745 Ponatinib is a potent pan-BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) currently in a pivotal phase 2 clinical trial. Ponatinib (PON) was specifically designed to target both native and all mutant forms of BCR-ABL, including T315I. The phase I study of oral ponatinib in patients with refractory CML/ALL or other hematologic malignancies recently reported that 66% and 53% of patients with CP-CML achieved MCyR and CCyR respectively (Cortes et al., ASH 2011 abstract #210). While extensive modelling experiments in BaF3 cells have been performed characterising in vitro response to ponatinib, little is known about the interactions of this drug and drug transporters that impact the response of other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). To explore this we have examined both the degree of in vitro kinase inhibition mediated by ponatinib in BCR-ABL+ cell lines, and the intracellular uptake and retention (IUR) of ponatinib achieved. The IC50 was determined by assessing the reduction in %p-Crkl in response to increasing concentrations of ponatinib in vitro . The IUR assay was performed as previously using [14-C]-ponatinib. To determine the role of ABCB1 and ABCG2, both previously implicated in the transport of other TKIs, IC50 analysis was performed on K562 cells, and variants; ABCB1 overexpressing K562-DOX and ABCG2 overexpressing K562-ABCG2. As shown in Table 1 , in contrast to the results previously observed with imatinib (IM), nilotinib (NIL) and dasatinib (DAS) there was no significant difference in the IC50 ponatinib between these three cell lines, suggesting neither ABCB1 nor ABCG2 play a major role in ponatinib transport. Furthermore, the addition of either the ABCB1 and ABCG2 inhibitor pantoprazole, or the multidrug resistance (MDR) inhibitor cyclosporin did not result in a significant change in the IC50 ponatinib in any of the cell lines tested. In contrast the addition of either pantoprazole or cyclosporin resulted in a significant reduction in IC50 IM , IC50 NIL. and IC50 DAS of K562-DOX cells, supporting the notion that these TKIs interact with ABCB1.

We demonstrate no significant difference in the IUR between these cell lines at 37\u00b0C (n=6) (K562 vs DOX p=0.6 ; K562 vs ABCG2 p=0.37 and DOX vs ABCG2 p=0.667 at 2uM respectively). Temperature dependent IUR experiments reveal a significant reduction in the ponatinib IUR at 4\u00b0C compared to 37\u00b0C in K562 cells (n=6) ( p=0.008 ), DOX cells ( p=0.004 ) and ABCG2 cells ( p=0.002 ) supporting the likely involvement of an ATP/temperature dependent, and yet to be determined, component of ponatinib influx. There was no significant difference in the IUR between these cell lines at 4\u00b0C ( p=0.824, p=0.7 and p=0.803 respectively). Importantly, these data are consistent with the IC50 ponatinib findings. If ATP dependent efflux pumps (ABCB1 and ABCG2) were actively transporting ponatinib, a significant decrease in IUR in DOX and ABCG2 at 37\u00b0C compared to K562 cells would be expected, but is not observed here. Analysis of ponatinib IUR in the prototypic ABCB1 over-expressing CEM-VBL100 cells, and their parental, ABCB1 null counterparts (CCRF-CEM) further confirmed these findings. The IUR in VBL100 cells was significantly higher than that observed in CEM's ( p<0.001 ; n=5), providing further evidence that ponatinib was not being exported from the cell actively via ABCB1. These data suggest that the transport of ponatinib is, at least in part, temperature-dependent indicating a yet to be determined ATP transporter may be involved in the transport of ponatinib into leukaemic cells. Importantly, this data suggests that ponatinib is unlikely to be susceptible to resistance via the major ATP efflux transporters (ABCB1 or ABCG2) that have been previously demonstrated to significantly impact the transport of, and mediate resistance to other clinically available TKIs.
