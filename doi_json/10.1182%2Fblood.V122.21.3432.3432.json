    "abstract_text": "Introduction Anemia is a significant issue in the geriatric population, having an impact on morbidity, mortality and quality of life. However, identifying the etiology of anemia is not possible in \u223c30% of patients. Postulated mechanisms of anemia of unknown etiology (AUE) include a blunted response to erythropoietin (EPO) or inadequate EPO production in response to anemia. The latter mechanism is of particular interest since it might be amenable to pharmacological intervention. Therefore, in order to explore the relationship between EPO levels and hemoglobin in elderly individuals with AUE, we conducted a systematic review of observational studies. Methods We searched Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, Biosis Previews and Dissertations and Theses using the terms erythropoietin, anemia, elderly and diagnosis as MeSH subject headings. Additional relevant articles were identified by hand searching the meeting abstracts of the European Hematology Association (2006 - 2012) and the American Society of Hematology (2004 - 2012). For inclusion into the final review, studies needed to report data on EPO levels in elderly individuals diagnosed with anemia of unknown etiology. No meta-analysis was conducted due to the heterogeneity of the retrieved studies. Results The search identified 4277 potentially relevant citations, of which 31 studies were reviewed in full and 7 cohort studies (2 retrospective, 5 prospective) were included in the final review. The included studies involved 2534 participants ( 1 ). In general, studies found: 1) lower EPO levels in AUE compared to iron deficiency anemia and other forms of anemia; 2) a lack of correlation between EPO levels and the severity of anemia; and 3) EPO levels in AUE that are in general higher than in non-anemic patients.

Hb: hemoglobin, CKD: chronic kidney disease, HD: hemodialysis View Large Conclusion Our findings suggest that EPO levels are generally elevated in elderly individuals with AUE, but remain inappropriately low, particularly when compared to anemia of other etiologies suggesting either a relative EPO deficiency, an abnormal EPO response or an abnormal erythroid cell response to EPO. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanisms involved, and the value of pharmacological interventions. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
