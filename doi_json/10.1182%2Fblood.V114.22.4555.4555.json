    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4555 Introduction HGFs have vastly improved the management of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, but are associated with unexpected toxicities. Methods Toxicities associated with granulocyte, erythroid, and thrombopoietic growth factors were reviewed. Data sources included systematic reviews, clinical trials, guidelines, and materials disseminated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMEA), and Canada Health and their advisory committees; product labels and safety notifications disseminated by manufacturers; and utilization data. Data abstracted were thromboembolic complications, immune-mediated cytopenias, bone marrow toxicities, systematic and synergistic toxicities, and regulatory responses. Results Granulopoiesis agents Pulmonary infiltrates were associated with administration of HGFs with bleomycin or chest radiation. Increased myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) risks among chemotherapy (chemo)-treated breast cancer patients were reported. ESAs Increased mortality and tumor progression were seen when cancer patients received ESAs versus placebo; increased mortality and cardiovascular events were reported when chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients received ESAs targeted to complete anemia correction. Between 1998 and 2003, 191 CKD patients developed neutralizing antibodies and pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) following recombinant erythropoietin administration. Thrombopoietins (TPO) TPO receptor agonist administration is associated with bone marrow reticulin and collagen deposition. 3% of healthy volunteers who received repeated rHuMGDF developed neutralizing autoantibodies and severe thrombocytopenia. Conclusions While ESAs, granulopoietic factors, and thrombopoietins have important clinical benefits, they also retain the potential to exhibit serious and unanticipated toxicities.  . ESAs .
