    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is a new treatment for B non Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) patients. 90 Y ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin\u00ae) consists of a murine monoclonal antibody to CD20, conjugated to a metal chelator tiuxetan for retention of the beta emitter 90 Y. Thus Zevalin\u00ae delivers radiation to B-NHL, combining the tumor targeting attributes of a monoclonal antibody and the beta radiation of 90 Y. Zevalin\u00ae is approved for the treatment of follicular lymphoma (FL) refractory to or relapsed after rituximab, on the bases of clinical trials where it achieved a response rate as high as 83%. Several ongoing registrational trials are evaluating the efficacy of Zevalin\u00ae in other NHL, as diffuse large B cell (DLCL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). We are here evaluating the effect of Zevalin\u00ae as consolidation therapy in NHL patients that achieved a complete clinical response (CCR) with chemotherapy. Methods: In B cell NHL patients that achieved a CCR after 1st or multiple lines anthracyclines based chemotherapy +/\u2212 Rituximab, minimal residual disease was evaluated by PCR on bone marrow samples, for the following rearrangements: JH, Bcl-1, Bcl-2. Patients received Zevalin\u00ae 6-9 weeks post chemotherapy. Evaluation of molecular response was assessed after a follow up period at 12 weeks. The aim of the study was the role of Zevalin\u00ae in inducing a complete molecular response (CMR). Results: 23 B-NHL patients (13 FL, 6 MCL, 4 DLCL; male:female 13:10, median age 63, range 42\u201373. See table) in a CCR after chemotherapy (documented by TC scan and/or PET-scan negative for abnormal lesions or glucose captation) have been enrolled. 10 patients had a pathological rearrangement before RIT, while 13 were already in a CMR condition. Zevalin\u00ae was completed in all 23 patients and the post infusion evaluation was performed after 12 weeks. In the follow-up period thrombocitopenia was commonly documented, but it was not associated to bleeding or need of platelet transfusion, but in one singular case. After 12 weeks from RIT a new molecular evaluation was performed on bone marrow samples. All the 23 patients have completed the 12 weeks follow-up: 8 of 10 (80%) patients positive before RIT achieved a CMR with Zevalin\u00ae administration. The 13 PCR negative patients maintained the CMR. The 21 PCR negative patients are now under follow-up to evaluate the molecular disease free survival after Zevalin\u00ae RIT. Conclusion: Zevalin\u00ae is an efficient consolidation therapy in B cell NHL patients after chemotherapy. In this series of patients Zevalin\u00ae administration allowed to convert 8 of 10 CCR to CMR. In the remaining 13 patients Zevalin\u00ae maintained the CMR. Zevalin\u00ae addition to medication treatment is feasible and associated with manageable hematological toxicity.
