    "abstract_text": "Abstract 917 Post-transcriptional regulation such as RNA editing in hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis is poorly understood. ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1) is a RNA editing enzyme essential for embryonic development. Disruption of the ADAR1 gene was shown to cause defective embryonic hematopoiesis (Wang Q et al, Science 2000). Moreover, we have recently obtained direct evidence for the preferential effect of ADAR1 deletion on adult hematopoietic progenitor cells as opposed to the more primitive cells via a RNA-editing dependent mechanism by different conditional gene deletion strategies (Xufeng R et al PNAS 2009, in press). To further determine the role of ADAR1 in T cell development, we generated a mouse model in which ADAR1 was deleted specifically in T lymphocytes by interbreeding ADAR1 lox/lox mice with Lck-Cre transgenic mice. In our current study, we report that ADAR1 is essential for T cell differentiation at the late progenitor stage in the thymus, coincident with T cell receptor-\u03b1/\u03b2 expression. In ADAR1 lox/lox Lck-Cre mice, mature T cells decreased dramatically in peripheral blood, spleen and lymph nodes in comparison to littermate controls. In the thymus, the production of CD4 + /CD8 + double positive cells was severely impaired and massive cell death was observed in pre-T cell populations. Within the pro-T cells, ADAR1 deletion resulted in a significant decrease of late progenitor cells but not early progenitor subsets. In both pro-T and pre-T cell stages, defective T cell development preferentially occurred in the beta chain positive cells, but was not apparent in gamma/delta T cells. Our data demonstrated an indispensable role of ADAR1 in early T cell differentiation that correlated with T cell receptor beta chain expression, thereby indicating that RNA editing by ADAR1 is an essential event in T cell development.
