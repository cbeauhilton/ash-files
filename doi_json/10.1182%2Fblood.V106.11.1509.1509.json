    "abstract_text": "HCV is largely, although not homogenously, diffuse in North-western Europe and U.S.A. It has been shown to play a role both in hepatocellular carcinoma and in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). Up to now the exact biological mechanisms that could explain the lymphomagenic role of the virus are unknown. We have previously published a series of 13 patients, affected by low grade B-cell NHL and characterized by an indolent course (i.e. doubling time less than 1 year, no bulky disease), who underwent antiviral treatment only with peghilated interferon and ribavirin (peghilated interferon 50\u201370 microgram weekly, ribavirin 1000\u20131200 mg daily). Now we report an update of this study. Up to now we were able to evaluate 16 patients with a mean follow up of 15,1\u00b1 7,6 months (range 2\u201328 months). Eight patients experienced complete or good partial haematological response that has lasted up to now with a mean follow up of 16,5 months, among them 3 splenic marginal lymphomas, 2 nodal marginal, 1 follicular lymphoma, 1 plasmocytoid and 1 marginal extranodal lymphoma. Three other patients achieved a long lasting partial response. The only one relapse (marginal nodal lymphoma) occurred about one year after the end of treatment, hematological relapse happened together with viral relapse, the lymphoma reappeared as highly chemo resistant high grade lymphoma, and two months later the patient died. Interestingly complete and good partial responses were more likely to be seen in viral genotype 2 (p=0.035) and were strictly related to the decrease of viral load under treatment (p=<0.001). Toxicity causes the stop of the treatment in 3 patients; however one of them was able to achieve complete hematological response. Time to achieve hematological response was quite long (mean 8\u00b1 4,5 months). This kind of experience strongly provides a role for antiviral treatment in patients affected by HCV related low grade B-cell NHL. Especially viral genotype 2 infection may be considered a good prognostic marker for hematological response as well as decrease of viral load under treatment. Toxicity in our hands was however significant and further experiences are warranted in order to better modulate antiviral therapy doses."
