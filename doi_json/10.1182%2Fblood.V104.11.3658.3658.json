    "abstract_text": "In 1999, Wu et al found that blood from patients with type 3 von Willebrand disease (lacking VWF in both plasma and platelets) could not form thrombi on a collagen surface ( Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc Biol  2000 , 20  1661 \u20131667 ). This suggested that VWF was absolutely required for the accumulation of platelets in thrombi under flow, even in the presence of fibrinogen. Platelets have two VWF receptors, the GP Ib-IX-V complexes and \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 , the former mediating the initial tethering and attachment of platelets onto VWF and the latter being involved in platelet-platelet contacts. GP Ib-IX-V binds VWF within the A1 domain and \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 is known to bind an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence in the C1 domain. In the study of Wu et al , reconstitution of the VWF-deficient plasma with recombinant VWF missing the A1 domain failed to restore thrombus formation, even when the collagen surface was first coated with wild-type VWF to allow platelet attachment. The A1 domain is thus important not only for initial platelet adhesion but also for thrombus accumulation, possibly by binding another platelet receptor. Consistent with this, the number of binding sites for the isolated A1 domain on the platelet surface is more than twice the number of GP Ib\u03b1 polypeptides. The receptor responsible for these binding sites is unknown but \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 is a good candidate given its high copy number and the marked defect seen in platelet thrombus formation in its absence or blockade. Of interest, while deletion of A1 prevented thrombus formation in the studies of Wu et al , mutation of the VWF RGD sequence did not. We therefore examined whether \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 also binds within the VWF A1 domain. We found the following. 1) Purified, unactivated \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 binds to immobilized A1 domain, binding blocked by antibodies to either \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 or A1. 2) Unactivated \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 does not interact with immobilized full-length VWF, but binds VWF in the presence of ristocetin. The binding of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 to both VWF and isolated A1 is blocked by the \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 antibody c7E3 but not by RGD peptides, and by the A1 antibody 6G1. This suggests that the \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 binding site in the A1 domain may overlap the 6G1 epitope (residues 700-709), which is distinct from the GPIb\u03b1 binding site. 3) 6G1 inhibits shear-induced platelet aggregation\u2014a process that requires both GP Ib\u03b1 and \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 \u2014without blocking GP Ib\u03b1 binding. 4) Platelets firmly adhere on the surface containing A1 and cross-linked collagen-related peptide (CRP), a potent GP VI agonist, at high shear stresses. The CRP-GP VI interaction is not strong enough to arrest platelets under flow, suggesting that GP VI signals could activate \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 , and \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 could mediate firm adhesion. Consistent with this, the \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 antibody c7E3 prevented firm platelet adhesion. In summary, we find that \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 binds to the A1 domain, in or near the sequence of Glu700-Asp709. In addition to its apparent role in platelet-platelet interactions during thrombus growth, the binding of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 to the VWF A1 domain may also facilitate the binding of GP Ib\u03b1 to a distinct region of A1, as the site of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 overlaps the binding site of ristocetin and 6G1, both which induce VWF to bind GP Ib\u03b1. Therefore, by binding to the same site as 6G1 and ristocetin in the C-terminal peptide of A1, \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 may regulate the affinity of A1 for GP Ib\u03b1 in flowing blood.",
