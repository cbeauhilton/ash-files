    "abstract_text": "Genomics holds particular potential for the elucidation of biological networks that underlie disease. For example, gene expression profiles have been used to classify human cancers, and have more recently been used to predict graft rejection following organ transplantation. Such signatures thus hold promise both as diagnostic approaches and as tools with which to dissect biological mechanism. Such systems-based approaches are also beginning to impact the drug discovery process. For example, it is now feasible to measure gene expression signatures at low cost and high throughput, thereby allowing for the screening libraries of small molecule libraries in order to identify compounds capable of perturbing a signature of interest (even if the critical drivers of that signature are not yet known). This approach, known as Gene Expression-Based High Throughput Screening (GE-HTS), has been shown to identify candidate therapeutic approaches in AML, Ewing sarcoma, and neuroblastoma, and has identified tool compounds capable of inhibiting PDGF receptor signaling. A related approach, known as the Connectivity Map ( www.broad.mit.edu/cmap ) attempts to use gene expression profiles as a universal language with which to connect cellular states, gene product function, and drug action. In this manner, a gene expression signature of interest is used to computationally query a database of gene expression profiles of cells systematically treated with a large number of compounds (e.g., all off-patent FDA-approved drugs), thereby identifying potential new applications for existing drugs. Such systems level approaches thus seek chemical modulators of cellular states, even when the molecular basis of such altered states is unknown."
