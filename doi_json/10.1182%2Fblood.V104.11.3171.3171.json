    "abstract_text": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a complex autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized within the hematological system by progressive bone marrow aplasia, a high propensity to develop acute myeloid leukemia, and hypersensitivity to alkylating agents including mitomycin c. The identification of individual FA genes raises the potential of using gene transfer technology to express/introduce the functional cDNA in/into deficient autologous stem cells. We have previously shown that in the absence of genetic correction with a retroviral mediated Fancc transgene, ex vivo culture of Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) predisposes uncorrected Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 HSPC cells to clonal hematopoiesis (Haneline, Blood 2003). Therefore we examined the potential of a helper-free human foamy virus (HFV) derived construct that encodes both the human FANCC and EGFP transgenes to transduce murine Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 HSC in the absence of prestimulation. In initial experiments, we determined that 40\u201380% of progenitors were transduced following a single overnight HFV infection using a 20:1 moiety of infection. Subsequent studies demonstrated that HFV efficiently transduced primitive hematopoietic progenitors in G 0 and G 1 phases of the cell cycle as evidenced both by using multicolor fluorescence activated cell sorting and subsequent culture of sorted cell populations in high proliferating potential (HPP-CFC) and low proliferating potential colony forming assays. Aliquots of HFV transduced cells that were transduced with the construct encoding both Fancc and EGFP , or the reporter transgene only were transplanted into irradiated recipient mice. Four months following transplantation, bone marrow cells were isolated from the reconstituted recipients and clonogenic assays were established in a range of mitomycin c (MMC) concentrations. In these experiments, the MMC hypersensitivity of Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 progenitors was corrected to wild-type levels. To assess quantitatively the potential of HFV expressed FANCC to correct stem cell repopulating ability, we next utilized the competitive repopulating assay. In two replicate experiments, we determined that the repopulating activity of HFV-transduced Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 stem cells was comparable to wildtype controls six months following transplantation in primary and secondary recipients. Collectively, these data provide in vivo evidence that the HFV vector is an efficient vehicle for introducing a functional hFANCC transgene into quiescent Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 HSC in the absence of prestimulation and for complementing the cellular FA defect in vitro and in vivo .",
