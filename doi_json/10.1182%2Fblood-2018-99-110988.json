    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Low socioeconomic status (SES) has been shown to shorten survival in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). We sought to determine if differences in outcome of cHL varied according to SES and geographic setting in a population-based analysis. Methods: All adult patients diagnosed in 2000-2014 with cHL were collected through Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR). Baseline SES and clinical variables were collected. Pearson Chi-square, log-rank, and cox regression tests were utilized. To minimize selection bias, cases with less than 6 months survival after cancer diagnosis were excluded. Results: A total of 1075 cHL patients were included, of which 605 (56.3%) were early stage vs. 405 (37.7%) were advanced stage. Most patients were under age 50 (63.2%) with a male predominance (55.4%). Nodular sclerosis was the most common histology (57.6%). Therapy consisted of chemotherapy alone in 729 (67.8%) patients, while 222 (20.7%) had received both chemotherapy and radiation. 633 (58.8%) lived in metro areas. Metro-area residents were more likely to come from non-Appalachian counties (93.7%), have more advanced education (76.8%) and have private insurance (60.1%) than non-metro-area residents (41.2%) (p<0.0001). There were no differences in age, gender, stage and histology at presentation according to geographic setting. Patients living in metro-area had a better OS by bivariate analysis (p=0.01) (Figure 1). A multivariate analysis identified age <50, early stage, privately insured, non-lymphocyte-depleted histology, and treatment with combined chemo-radiation as independent factors favoring an improved OS. Conclusion: Our study shows that despite the absence of differences in presenting clinical variables based on SES or geographic setting, significant discrepancies in outcome are observed. This disparity in outcomes may have been affected by differences in access to or quality of care delivery and may widen with the introduction of more costly novel interventions.
