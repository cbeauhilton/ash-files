    "abstract_text": "Intranasal desmopressin (IN-DDAVP) is used for home treatment of menorrhagia in women with inherited bleeding disorders. The effect of IN-DDAVP on laboratory hemostatic parameters in women with menorrhagia and associated platelet dysfunction is unknown. We evaluated the effects of IN-DDAVP on hemostatic parameters in women with menorrhagia and platelet dysfunction and correlated them with menstrual blood flow. Eleven women (aged 18\u201345) with menorrhagia and abnormal platelet aggregation and/or platelet adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) release had determination of factor VIII coagulant activity (FVIII: C), von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF: Ag), von Willebrand factor ristocetin cofactor (VWF: RCo) activity, platelet aggregation, and platelet ATP release pre and 60 minutes post IN-DDAVP. Eight of eleven women underwent Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA-100) closure time determination with collagen/epinephrine (CEPI) and collagen/adenosine diphosphate (CADP) cartridge pre and post treatment. IN-DDAVP was administered during two consecutive menstrual cycles. Menstrual blood flow was assessed during each cycle using a pictorial blood assessment chart (PBAC). Following administration of IN-DDAVP there was a 2\u20133 fold increase in FVIII: C, VWF: Ag, and VWF: RCo observed in most patients over baseline levels. Mean FVIII:C increased from 130% \u00b1 34.8% to 218% \u00b1 96.5% ( P < 0.007), VWF: Ag increased from 86.9% \u00b1 35.1% to 128.7% \u00b1 64.3% ( P < 0.011), and VWF: RCo increased from 89.8% \u00b1 42.8% to 139.6% \u00b1 86.5% ( P < 0.02). The median baseline PBAC score of 235 decreased to 136 following IN-DDAVP. In addition, there were significant inverse correlations between changes in PBAC score and changes in VWF: Ag ( r s = \u2212 0.85, p = 0.02), VWF: RCo ( r s = \u22120.81, p = 0.029), and FVIII:C ( r s = 0.92, p = 0.003) with IN-DDAVP. Mean PFA-100 closure time with the CEPI cartridge shortened from 166.8sec \u00b1 85sec to 90.9sec \u00b1 49.3sec (p< 0.02), and the closure time with the CADP cartridge shortened from 104.5sec \u00b1 34.3sec to 64.8sec \u00b1 40.4sec (p <0.007). There were significant inverse correlations between post IN-DDAVP PFA-100 CADP closure time and post IN-DDAVP FVIII:C ( r s = \u22120.86, p = 0.005), VWF: Ag ( r s = \u22120.72, p = 0.04), and VWF: RCo ( r s = \u22120.80, p = 0.01). In addition there were also significant inverse correlations between post IN-DDAVP PFA-100 CEPI closure time and post IN-DDAVP FVIII:C ( r s = \u22120.73, p = 0.03), and VWF: RCo ( r s = \u22120.74, p = 0.03), but not VWF: Ag ( r s = \u22120.66, p = 0.07). In-vitro platelet aggregation and platelet ATP release response did not correct and did not correlate with changes in menstrual blood flow. Our results demonstrate a correlation between VWF parameters and menstrual blood flow following IN-DDAVP in women with menorrhagia and underlying platelet dysfunction.",
