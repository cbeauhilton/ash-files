    "abstract_text": "Background: Thrombin generation and other clotting assays suffer from a wide variation of pre-analytical variables. One of those pre-analytical variables is contact activation through blood withdrawal methods, different syringes, differences in blood coagulation tubes, blood transport and sample handling. It has been shown that the addition of contact activation inhibitors in low tissue factor activated thrombin generation leads to a correction of the, in these circumstances significant, increase in thrombin generation due to contact activation. We compare the novel 'thermostable inhibitor of contact activation' (TICA) to the current standard 'corn trypsin inhibitor' (CTI). Aim: Comparing the effectiveness of novel contact activation inhibitor TICA to the current standard CTI in low tissue factor-induced thrombin generation and recalcification in sodium citrate anticoagulated platelet poor plasma (PPP) and platelet rich plasma (PRP). Methods: We compared TICA, Corn trypsin inhibitor and plasma without contact activation inhibitors in low tissue factor PPP thrombin generation and in PRP recalcification thrombin generation, the latter the most sensitive condition for contact activation. In addition, we compared low tissue factor activated thrombin generation in plasma from severe hemophilia A patients with and without TICA during and after blood drawing. Thermostability - as a measure of shelf life - was measured and compared to CTI. Results: TICA is able to fully block contact activation in PRP recalcification experiments and is comparable to CTI in doing so. TICA significantly lowers low tissue factor induced thrombin generation by blocking contact activation. Pre-loading vacuum blood collection tubes with contact activation inhibitors is superior in inhibiting contact activation compared to addition of the inhibitor during the thrombin generation assay itself. TICA did not alter coagulation activity when added to FXIIa deficient plasma in thrombin generation. In contrast to CTI TICA is heat stable which will be of benefit to shelf life of pre-loaded blood drawing tubes. Conclusion: TICA is able to fully block contact activation and has several advantages over CTI. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
