    "abstract_text": "HLA-B27 is a strong diagnostic biomarker as it is found in 90\u2013 95% of ankylosing spondylitis. Routinely, the false-positive results generated by cross-reactivity of HLA-B27 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with some other type of HLA-B antigens are problematic. The present study aims at improving the sensitivity and specificity of typing for HLA-B27 by using a more accurate DNA assay. A real time sequence specific primer polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SSP) is performed by using MGB TaqMan oligoprobe and an ABI PRISM \u2122 7500 sequence detection system. The TaqMan PCR-SSP assay is compared with Immunophenotyping by flow cytometric antigen assay (BD HLA-B27-Kit, clone GS145.2). The results are finally confirmed by sequencing (ABI PRISM \u00ae 3100). As summarised in the table, three methods are identical for clearly positive and negative results. There is 90% concordance for borderline negative results obtained by immunophenotyping with TaqMan PCR-SSC and/or sequencing. However, only 15.4% of borderline positives obtained by immunophenotyping are confirmed as true HLA-B27 positives by sequencing as well as TaqMan PCR-SSC. TaqMan PCR-SSP DNA assay completely correlates with sequencing (gold standard) with 100% PPV and NPV, compared to a PPV of 15% and a NPV of 98% for borderline results by immunophenotyping. Conclusion: when compared with flow cytometric antigen assay, typing HLA-B27 by TaqMan PCR-SSP clearly demonstrates an advantage to better establish the genotype of the patient. Specifically, there is a marked difference for ambitious positive results from immunophenotyping. Moreover, compared to immunophenotyping, there is no need of fresh samples, can test a larger number of samples concomitantly, and reduces technical time as well as cost.  N = 52 .
