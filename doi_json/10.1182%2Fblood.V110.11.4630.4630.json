    "abstract_text": "Recent advances in the diagnosis, molecular pathogenesis, classification and therapy have been made in the field of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) in childhood. We report a retrospective analysis of children with MDS and JMML diagnosed between 2001 and 2006 in Korea. In total, 135 patients were enrolled from 19 major hospitals with pediatric hematology oncology clinics: MDS, 96 (primary MDS, 77; constitutional anomalies with MDS, 13; treatment-related MDS, 6) and JMML, 39. The incidence of MDS/JMML was around 22.5/year, which is about 6% of childhood leukemia. Various classification systems including FAB, WHO, IPSS, CCC system, and pediatric adjustment of the WHO classification were applied. The median ages at diagnosis were 68 and 10 months in MDS, and JMML, respectively. Males dominated in JMML. Cytogenetic abnormalities were observed in 43% of MDS (monosomy 7, 5; trisomy 8, 3) and in 10% of JMML. Treatment was chosen by each institute\u2019s preference: 34 patients with MDS received AML-type intensive chemotherapy, with complete remission rate of 82.0%. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier overall survival rate was 54% each for MDS and JMML. Survival of MDS patients was influenced by the marrow blast % ( P = 0.007) and disease category ( P = 0.006). Stem cell transplantations (SCT) were undertaken in 56 patients (MDS, 29; JMML, 27). The sources of stem cells were: bone marrow, 36; umbilical cord, 18; peripheral blood, 2). Matched related transplants were 9 cases. Conditioning was various, but BuCy based regimen was used in 68.4%. Acute GvHD \u2265 Grade II was found in 43.8% and chronic GvHD in 35.1%. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier overall survival rate was 55% for MDS, and 57% for JMML. Survival after unrelated transplant was comparable with that of matched related transplants. This analysis inspired the necessity of nation-wide prospective studies in Korea, including morphologic study by a central pathology review board, epidemiologic study, molecular pathophysiologic study, and therapeutic trials incorporating SCTs, or new drugs.",
