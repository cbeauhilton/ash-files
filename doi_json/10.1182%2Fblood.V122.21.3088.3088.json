    "abstract_text": "The prognosis of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) has been improved by the emergence of new molecular targeting agents including proteasome inhibitors and immunomodurating agents. Nevertheless, MM remains incurable at present because it is likely that MM stem cells are resistant to these targeting agents. Thus, it is important to further investigate the biology of MM stem cells to cure the MM patients. We have demonstrated that b-catenin is a novel and attractive target against MM (Ashihara et al. Clin Cancer Res , 2009; Yao et al. Blood Cancer J , 2011). We next investigate novel targets focused on the hypoxic bone marrow (BM) environment. BM is known to have low levels of oxygen, particularly at the epiphysis, which is distant form the BM arterial blood supply. Normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in this hypoxic epiphyseal region \u201cniche\u201d, and HSCs are protected from DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species. We have previously found that chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells engrafted in the BM survived and proliferated in the severely hypoxic environment and that these hypoxia-adapted (HA) leukemic cells acquired stem cell-like characters (Takeuchi et al. Cell Death Differ , 2010). In this study, we investigated the characteristics of hypoxia-adapted MM (HA-MM) cells. We first confirmed oxygen status in the BM of the MM cell-engrafted mice. Irradiated NOD/SCID mice were inoculated with 2 x 10 6 AMO-1 cells. After 2 or 4 weeks transplantation, we sacrificed mice and confirmed engraftment. The inoculated MM cells engrafted in the epiphysis in recipient mice after 2 weeks transplantation, and populated endosteum of epiphysis after 4 weeks. These MM cells were positive for pimonidazole, which specifically accumulated in hypoxic cells (< 1.3% O 2 concentration). These observations suggested that MM cells resided in the BM are hypoxic. We then established AMO-1, OPM-2, and IM-9 HA-MM cells cultured under hypoxic conditions (O 2 1%). These HA cells can continue to proliferate in hypoxic conditions for more than six months. In flow cytometric analysis, the G 0 fraction cells as well as side population fraction cells significantly increased in HA-MM cells compared with those in the parental MM cells. We next transplanted parental or HA-MM AMO-1 cells with same cell numbers into irradiated NOD/SCID mice. The survival durations of mice transplanted with HA-AMO-1 cells were significantly shorter than that of mice transplanted with parental cells. Moreover, in serial transplantation experiments, all 5 HA-MM cell-transplanted mice died of MM whereas 1 out of 5 parental MM cell-transplanted mice ( Figure 1 ). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that Sox2 , Oct3 , and Nanog mRNA transcripts increased in the HA-MM AMO-1 cells ( Figure 2 ). We next investigated the signaling pathway activated in HA-MM cells. Interestingly, phosphorylated Smad2 expression was increased in HA-AMO-1 cells. These findings suggest that HA-MM cells possess stem cell-like character, and these cells may provide a useful model to investigate the mechanism of MM stem cells (myeloma-initiating cells) resistant to molecular target agents.
