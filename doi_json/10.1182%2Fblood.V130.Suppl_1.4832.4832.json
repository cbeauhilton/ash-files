    "abstract_text": "Background: Nuclear receptors aretranscription factors that are activated by ligands and subsequently bind to regulatory regions in target genes. Recently ligand-activated transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) has been reported to promote the formation of platelets from megakaryocytes and accelerate platelet recovery after radiation-induced bone marrow injuries. The endogenous prostaglandin 15-deoxy-\u0394 12,14 prostaglandin J 2 (15d-PGJ 2 ) are ligands of PPAR\u03b3. Accumulating evidences also suggest that PPAR activation is involved in inflammation responses and atherosclerosis. In the present study, we analyzed how PPAR ligands and some brown algae-based compounds affect platelet differentiation and functions in vitro. Methods: Platelets were obtained from plateletpheresis products by centrifugation. DAMI and Meg-1 cells, both human megakaryocytic cell lines, were also obtained. Western blotting for PPAR\u03b3, PPAR\u03b1 and COX-2 was performed, and bands were visualized by chemiluminescence. The effects of 15d-PGJ 2 , GW9662, Fucoidan, Seanol, GW6471 and Celecoxib were evaluated. Morphology analysis, platelet flow cytometry, total thrombus formation analysis system (T-TAS) and microarray expression analysis were also used in order to analyze the effects of the treatment on platelets. Results: Megakaryoblasts and mature platelets showed different results in the expression of PPAR\u03b1, COX-2, glycoproteins and platelet activation markers. PGJ 2 induced morphological differentiation evidences in DAMI and Meg-1 cells. PGJ 2 increased the levels of CD41, CD42b, CD62p and PAC-1 both in DAMI and Meg-1 cells. In mature platelets, Fucoidan and Seanol decreased the expression of PPAR\u03b1 and increased COX-2 expression. Fucoidan elevated the expression of CD62p and CD63 in mature platelets, suggesting that Fucoidan causes platelet activation. In microarray analysis, fucoidan showed early growth response (EGR)-1 gene upregulation. Unfortunately thrombogenesity by T-TAS was not evident from the study. Conclusions: The mechanism of platelet production and activation is not fully understood. Understanding the mechanisms underlying megakaryocyte maturation and platelet production will facilitate the development of methods to increase the production of platelets from precursor cells. Although platelets are non-nucleated cells, they contain transcription factors, especially PPAR and NF-\u03baB. From the present study, our findings support the hypothesis that PPAR, both PPAR\u03b3 and PPAR\u03b1 play a role in platelet differentiation and activation, and exact mechanisms need to be defined related to prostaglandin pathways. Fucoidan may activate platelets via different pathways than PGJ 2 . Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
