    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The application of nanoparticles in dendritic cell (DC)-based cancer immunotherapy represents a promising strategy to enhance antigen-specific T cell immune responses. This study was to investigate the effect of bPEI-SPIONs on antigen-specific T cell responses elicited by DCs loaded with apoptotic U266 myeloma tumor antigen in the presence or absence of bPEI-SPIONs. Materials and Methods: The myeloma tumor antigens were prepared as following: 1) apoptotic U266 cells by UBV-irradiation and overnight incubation (16 h irradiated cells) and 2) apoptotic U266 cells by UVB-irradiation and 2 h incubation in the absence (2 h irradiated cells) or 3) presence of bPEI-SPIONs (bPEI-SPION 2 h irradiated cells). Monocyte-derived immature DCs were activated with TNF-\u03b1, loaded with several kinds of myeloma tumor antigens 2 h after TNF-\u03b1 stimulation, and cultured for 2 days. Results: Optimal concentration of bPEI-SPIONs was 16 \u00b5g/mL to uptake into tumor cells and the bPEI-SPIONs render U266 cells sensitive to UVB-irradiation through reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction pathway hence accelerated the apoptotic cell death. 2 h irradiated cells and bPEI-SPION 2 h irradiated cells released immunogenic proteins, including HSP70, HSP90, and HMGB1. bPEI-SPION 2 h irradiated cells were easily up-taken by DCs without alteration of surface phenotypes and migration capacities. DCs loaded with bPEI-SPION 2 h irradiated cells showed highest IL-12p70 production level and Th1 polarization compared to other DCs. Conclusion: These results suggest that bPEI-SPIONs are a promising tool to improve immunogenicity of myeloma tumor cells and to enhance Th1 polarization of DCs loaded with these tumor cells.
