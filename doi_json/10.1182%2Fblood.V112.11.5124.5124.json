    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The kidney is affected by immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL) in more than 50% of patients who present with the disease, but long-term predictors for and outcomes after renal replacement therapy have not been well described in this patient group Patients: 145 patients with AL who participated in Mayo Clinic treatment trials and were monitored for at least 11 years. No patient was lost to follow-up Results: Among patients presenting with renal AL, 42% ultimately received renal replacement therapy compared with 5% of patients who did not have an initial presentation involving the kidney.

The presenting 24-hour urine protein loss and creatinine values predict which patients will require dialysis. Median survival for patients starting dialysis is less than 1 year. Presence of l light chain amyloid predicts an increased likelihood of renal involvement and, when the kidney is affected, increased proteinuria.",
