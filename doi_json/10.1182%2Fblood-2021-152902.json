    "abstract_text": "The Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway is a major player in the control of DNA replication integrity in response to replication stress. Germline defect in the pathway results in the FA syndrome characterized by developmental abnormalities, bone marrow (BM) failure, and genome instability which greatly elevates the incidence of cancers. A pivotal step in the activation of the FA DNA repair pathway is the monoubiquitination of the FANCD2 and FANCI proteins (ID2) by the FA core complex, a unique ubiquitin ligase complex which includes eight proteins (FANCA-FANCG, FANCL, and FAAP100) and UBE2T/FANCT. This monoubiquitination event enables the recruitment of the ID2 complex to chromatin and nuclear foci at sites of DNA damage. Cells with mutations in any of the FA core complex proteins lack the ability to monoubiquitinated ID2, making ID2 ubiquitination a convergence point in the pathway, with an estimation of>90% FA patients defective in this step. Additionally, somatic mutations In FA genes render tumor cells sensitive to DNA crosslinking agents, so identification of FA pathway defects provides an opportunity for therapeutic targeting. In search for additional potential target/substrate of this unique FA core ubiquitin ligase complex, we performed a high throughput genome-wide ubiquitin-specific proteomics (UbiScan) screen and found, in addition to the ID2 complex, many ubiquitinated proteins are dysregulated (mostly downregulated) in FA deficient cells compared with that of FA proficient cells. We used a Ubiquitin Remnant Motif (K- \u2211-GG) Antibody Bead Conjugate (Cell Signaling Technology), a proprietary ubiquitin branch (\"K- \u2211-GG\") antibody with specificity for a di-glycine tag that is the remnant of ubiquitin left on protein substrates after trypsin digestion, to enrich ubiquitinated peptides from trypsin digested cell samples (shNT vs shFANCA). This enrichment is followed by LC-MS/MS analysis for quantitative profiles of hundreds to over a thousand nonredundant ubiquitinated sequences. We were successful in demonstrating that under steady-state conditions (without proteasome inhibitor treatment), the ubiquitinated forms of both FANCD2 and FANCI proteins are much higher in control (shNT) HeLa cells compared with that of the cells depleted of FANCA (shFANCA). We then collaborated with the Cell signaling technology to perform a high throughput UbiScan\u00ae analysis of total ubiquitinated proteins both in total nuclei and chromatin fractions under replicative stress conditions. UbiScan\u00ae enables researchers to isolate, identify and quantitate large numbers of ubiquitin-modified cellular peptides with a high degree of specificity and sensitivity, providing a global overview of the ubiquitination sites in cellular proteins in cell and tissue samples without preconceived biases about where these modified sites occur. A total of 16,249 redundant modified peptide assignments to 7,856 modified sites for the Ubiquitin K-GG Remnant Motif Antibody were obtained. As expected, the amount of monoubiquitinated FANCD2 (at K651) and FANCI (at K523) were highly reduced in both the nuclear and chromatin fractions of Hela cells depleted of FANCA (shA). Consistent with the earlier findings, the amount of ubiquitinated ID2 proteins were extremely low in the chromatin fraction of the Hela cells depleted of FANCA. Since there are numerous ubiquitinated proteins found to be dysregulated in our UbiScan analyses, we used the following criteria to select the target proteins based on; a) -fold changes, and b) proteins that are known to participate in the DNA repair signaling pathways. We validated our UbiScan results by using an assay system to detect endogenous protein ubiquitination. We also found a significant reduction in the ubiquitination of several DNA repair-related proteins (found in our UbiScan analysis) in FANCA deficient cells. To assess FA pathway functions, we generated HAP1 and appropriate cells knock out of these select ubiquitinated target proteins by using CRISPR-Cas9 system. Then, the KO cells were examined for FA pathway functions. These results will be discussed. In conclusion, our findings reveal that the FA core ubiquitin ligase complex regulates (directly or indirectly) the ubiquitinated levels of many novel proteins outside of the ID2 complex, and these novel target proteins may provide important additional mechanistic insights into the FA DNA repair pathway.
