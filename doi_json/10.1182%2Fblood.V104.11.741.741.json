    "abstract_text": "The platelet \u03b1IIb\u03b23 (GPIIb/IIIa) integrin plays an important role in platelet function. Mutations in either \u03b1IIb or \u03b23 can cause Glanzmann thrombasthenia by interfering with its biogenesis and/or function. We have previously reported three missense mutations in the \u03b2-propeller domain of \u03b1IIb, namely G128S, S287L and G357S, among three unrelated patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia in southern India. Immunoblot analysis of platelet lysates showed no detectable \u03b1IIb in any of the patients and trace amounts of \u03b23 in the latter two patients. Here, we describe further characterization of these mutations carried out by expression studies. Transfections were performed using HEK 293 cell lines with each of the following constructs: mock (vector only), \u03b1IIb only, normal \u03b1IIb\u03b23, and mutant \u03b1IIb\u03b23 (mutant \u03b1IIb G128S, S287L, or G357S co-transfected with normal \u03b23). Stable cell lines were generated by G418 selection. While 52% of the normal \u03b1IIb\u03b23 cell lines bound antibody 10E5 (background = 5% positive), and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of this subpopulation was 43 units, only 0, 2 and 8% of the mutant cell lines bound 10E5 above background, and the extent of binding among the positive cells was low (MFIs 14, 14 and 35). Immunoprecipitation of the cell lysates and immunoblotting showed no detectable mature \u03b1IIb in the G128S mutant. In contrast, when compared with results of normal \u03b1IIb\u03b23, the S287L mutant showed 7% of the normal value of mature \u03b1IIb, and the G357S mutant showed 24% of the normal value. Pulse-chase analysis showed maturation of pro-\u03b1IIb to mature, cleaved \u03b1IIb in the normal \u03b1IIb\u03b23 cell line over 0\u201324 h. All three mutants demonstrated pro-\u03b1IIb bands comparable to the normal pro-\u03b1IIb band, but there was no conversion to mature \u03b1IIb in the G128S mutant, and trace conversion to mature \u03b1IIb in the S287L and G357S mutants. The disappearance of pro-\u03b1IIb in the three mutants was very similar to that of the normal \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and the \u03b1IIb only cell lines, with about 50% lost after 4 h. Thus, the failure of the mutant pro-\u03b1IIb to progress to mature \u03b1IIb was not a result of rapid degradation of pro-\u03b1IIb. Immunofluorescence of the normal \u03b1IIb\u03b23 cell line demonstrated strong \u03b1IIb staining on the surface, with \u03b1IIb also co-localizing with an ER marker (calnexin) and a Golgi marker (mannosidase II). In contrast, while all three mutants showed \u03b1IIb co-localizing in the ER, the G128S mutant showed no co-localization in the Golgi apparatus, and the other two mutants showed only slight co-localization in the Golgi. Surface staining was undetectable in the G128S and S287L mutants and decreased in the G357S mutant. These experiments show that the three \u03b2-propeller mutations do not affect the production of pro-\u03b1IIb or its stability. Instead, they affect transport from ER to the Golgi, most likely as a result of reducing \u03b1IIb\u03b23 complex formation. Hence, the mutant pro-\u03b1IIb appears to be retained in the ER and then degraded."
