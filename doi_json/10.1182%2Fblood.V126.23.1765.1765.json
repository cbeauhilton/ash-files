    "abstract_text": "Background: Proteasome inhibitors have a fundamental role in the treatment of multiple myeloma however there are still patients who fail to achieve a good response and have a dismal prognosis. Markers predicting the outcome of individual patients are needed to identify those who would benefit more from a different approach. Proteasome subunit beta type 1 (PSMB1) rs12717 single nucleotide polymorphism (C/G substitution resulting in a P11A change) was reported recently to be associated with greater clinical benefit in relapsed follicular lymphoma patients treated with bortezomib containing combination (Coiffier et al Clin Cancer Res 2013). To the best of our knowledge there is only one report with limited number of myeloma patients showing no association between PSMB1 P11A genotype and survival (Lichter et al Blood 2012). Aims and Methods: We analyzed the association of PSMB1 P11A polymorphism and treatment outcome of 220 consecutive myeloma patients having had first line chemotherapy in our unit. PSMB1 P11A polymorphism was tested using LightCycler melting analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS (version 20.0) software package. Results: The distribution of presentation prognostic markers such as age, ISS and FISH were even among the three genotype groups. 149 patients had bortezomib-based chemotherapy, mainly VTD (n=76) and MPV (n=47); 63% of these patients had ASCT consolidation. 71 patients had non-bortezomib-containing induction with either thalidomide, lenalidomide or other protocols including MP and VAD; only 28% of these patients had ASCT. In a recessive model the median PFS was 727 (635-818) days in carriers of the wild type C allele either in homozygous of heterozygous form (C/C&C/G, n=188), and only 491 (366-615) days in the homozygous variant G allele carriers (G/G, n=32, p=0.01). In multivariate analysis, C allele carriers had favorable PFS compared to G/G genotype patients with a hazard ratio of 1.402 (1.093-1.799), p=0.008 besides age, ISS, FISH, bortezomib treatment and ASCT. When we analyzed separately the bortezomib-treated and non-bortezomib-treated patients the benefit in PFS was only present in the bortezomib group [Fig 1, PFS 747 (656-837) days in C/C&C/G and 448 (279-616) days in G/G patients, p=0.002], and not in patients treated without bortezomib (p=0.559). We performed statistical interaction testing which showed significant interaction between bortezomib exposure and PSMB1 P11A (p=0.035). Conclusion: PSMB1 P11A is a novel predictive marker in multiple myeloma which could help to identify patients having a suboptimal response to bortezomib who might benefit from alternative management.
