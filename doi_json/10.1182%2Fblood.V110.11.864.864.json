    "abstract_text": "Methotrexate (MTX) is an antifolate widely used to treat childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MTX is retained within cells as long-chain polyglutamates (MTX-PGs), after metabolism by the enzyme folylpoly-\u03b3-glutamate synthetase (FPGS). Intracellular retention of MTX-PGs results in enhanced cytotoxicity due to prolonged inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and the additional inhibition of thymidylate synthetase (TS). The FPGS gene was shown to be regulated by the transcription factors Sp1 and NFY. We performed DNaseI hypersensitive assays and identified a hypersensitive site mapping closely upstream of exon 1 suggesting that chromatin remodeling may contribute to FPGS gene regulation. Using co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting we investigated the role of histone modifications and chromatin remodeling on the expression of FPGS and uncovered interactions between NFY, Sp1 and HDAC1. Our results demonstrate that HDAC1 complexes with NFY and Sp1 transcription factors in both B- and T-ALL cells. DNA affinity precipitation assay (DAPA) revealed that the HDAC1-NFY and HDAC1-Sp1 complex binds to the NFY and Sp1 binding sites in the FPGS promoter. These findings suggest that transcription of the FPGS gene may be regulated by acetylation of NFY and Sp1 factors and interaction with HDAC1, and/or chromatin remodeling. We then examined the effect of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) sodium butyrate (NaBu) on the expression of FPGS and other folate-related genes. The level of FPGS, ATP-binding cassette subfamily C (ABCC1), ATP-binding cassette subfamily G (ABCG2), DHFR, \u03b3-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH), solute carrier family 19/folate transporter (SLC19A1), and TS mRNA gene expression was determined by qRT-PCR in NALM6 (Bp-ALL), REH (Bp-ALL, t(12,21)/TEL-AML1), SupB15 (Bp-ALL, t(9,22)/BCR-ABL), and CCRF-CEM (T-ALL) cells treated with NaBu [2mM-5mM]. In all cell lines examined, treatment with NaBu induced 2- to 5-fold the level of FPGS and ABCC1 mRNA expression whereas the level of DHFR, SLC19A1, and TS mRNA expression was decreased. Expression of GGH and ABCG2 mRNAs was increased 2-fold in CCRF-CEM but remained unaltered in Bp-ALL NaBu treated cells. Promoters of butyrate-responsive genes have been shown to contain genetic elements such as Sp1/Sp3 binding sites which interact with HDAC1 to mediate the action of NaBu. On this basis, we hypothesized that pre-treatment of ALL cells with NaBu should lead to induction of FPGS expression and subsequently, higher synthesis of MTX-PG and enhanced MTX cytotoxicity in ALL cells. To test this hypothesis, CCRF-CEM, NALM6, REH, and SupB15 cells were treated sequentially with NaBu (24h) and MTX (4h), and assessed for cell viability. Treatment of NaBu and MTX increased cell death by \u223c40% in NALM6, REH, and SupB15 Bp-cells, and \u223c60% in CCRF-CCEM cells when compared to treatment with each drug alone. These data suggest that combination of HDACi and MTX may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of ALL. This strategy may be particularly useful to overcome MTX resistance in patients diagnosed with phenotypes that accumulate low levels of MTX-PGs and for patients after relapse."
