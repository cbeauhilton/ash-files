    "abstract_text": "Background: Maintaining serum ferritin (SF) levels below 1000 ng/mL has been reported to predict longer survival and a reduced risk of complications (eg heart failure) in patients with thalassemia major. Experience with deferoxamine (Desferal \u00ae , DFO) has indicated that the toxicity of DFO may increase as SF levels decrease. A target SF value in the deferasirox clinical trials was not specified per protocol, but was determined by the individual investigators. This analysis evaluates the safety of deferasirox (Exjade \u00ae ) in a cohort of adult and pediatric patients with transfusion-dependent anemias and iron overload from two large clinical trials (107 and 108) who were chelated to SF levels <1000 ng/mL. Methods: In core studies 107 and 108, frequently-transfused patients with chronic anemias \u22652 years old received deferasirox 5\u201330 mg/kg/day for 1 year. Eligible patients were then enrolled in 4-year extension trials, where initial dosing was based on the end of core study liver iron concentration; dose adjustments were based on SF levels. Patients eligible for this analysis had an initial SF \u22651000 ng/mL. Patients who achieved a SF level <1000 ng/mL on \u22652 consecutive visits, any time after starting deferasirox, were identified. The number of days when SF was <1000 ng/mL was calculated for each patient. AEs in these patients were calculated for the entire period on deferasirox, and for the period following the first SF measurement of <1000 ng/mL, irrespective of future SF levels. Results: 474 patients were included in this analysis: underlying anemias were \u03b2-thalassemia (n=379), myelodysplastic syndromes (n=43), Diamond-Blackfan anemia (n=30) and other anemias (n=22). Overall, 13.5% patients achieved SF1000 ng/mL groups were 872 and 2118 ng/mL, respectively. The incidence of drug-related AEs (gastrointestinal, renal and liver) did not appear to increase during the periods after SF levels first decreased below 1000 ng/mL (data not shown). Table 1.

These findings suggest that ironoverloaded patients can be safely chelated with deferasirox to low SF levels.",
