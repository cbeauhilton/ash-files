    "abstract_text": "Lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) were seen during and after treatment of leukemia. We aimed to characterize the specific pathology and MRI findings observed in leukemia patients with CNS lesions and to determine their value in the management of such patients. The data from stereotactic biopsy for pathology (12 patients) and MRI examinations (14 patients) were retrospectively evaluated. Factors that predisposed to the lesions of CNS were reviewed from the medical records. Among the 14 patients, 4 had a CNS infection, 2 had a neurodegenerative disorder, 8 had CNS leukemia. The clinical diagnosis based on clinical presentation and MRI features was not consistent with the pathological diagnosis in 2 patients: in one patient, the clinical diagnosis was a CNS infection, though the patient's pathological diagnosis was CNS leukemia; in the other patient, the clinical diagnosis was CNS leukemia, but the pathological diagnosis was glial cell hyperplasia. CNS lesions in leukemia have a wide range of causes. Apart from the relapse of leukemia in CNS, there are treatment related neurotoxicities and infections that are caused by immunocompromised states. Stereotactic biopsy for pathological confirmation has the advantages of minimal invasion and convenience, which remains the gold standard for diagnosing the nature of CNS lesions. Because many CNS lesions of leukemia are treatable, early correctly diagnosis is essential. Table 1. Medical records of 14 leukemia patients with CNS lesions . case . Age, y /Sex . Leukemia type .
