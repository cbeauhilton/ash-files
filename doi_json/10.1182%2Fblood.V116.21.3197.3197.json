    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3197 Background: Thrombosis and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) result from blood vessel occlusion by inappropriately activated platelets. They are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Anthocyanins are major phytochemicals abundant in plant food and have been shown to play a protective role against CVDs. Our previous studies have demonstrated that anthocyanins are antioxidative and prevent inflammation (J Biol Chem. 2005; 280:36792-01; Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2007; 27:519-24), which may indirectly affect platelet function. It has also been reported that anthocyanins affect platelet activities in whole blood and platelet rich plasma (PRP). However, the direct effects of anthocyanins on platelet function and thrombus formation have not been studied. Methods: Here we investigated the effects of anthocyanins on thrombosis using purified platelets as well as several thrombosis models in vitro and in vivo . Cyaniding-3-gulucoside (Cy-3-g) and delphinidin-3-glucoside (Dp-3-g), the two predominantly bioactive compounds of anthocyanin preparations, were prepared from Polyphenol AS Company in Norway. Purified gel-filtered platelets and PRP from healthy human volunteers and C57BL/6J mice were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 minutes with different concentrations (0.5\u03bcM, 5\u03bcM and 50\u03bcM) of Cy-3-g, Dp-3-g or PBS buffer as a control. Platelet aggregation was assessed by aggregometry using 5\u03bcM ADP, 10\u03bcg/ml collagen, or 100\u03bcM thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP; AYPGKF) as agonists. Platelet adhesion and aggregation were assessed in response to an immobilized collagen matrix in an ex vivo perfusion chamber at both high (1800 s -1 ) and low (600 s -1 ) shear rates. The expression of activated GPIIbIIIa was determined via PAC-1 monoclonal antibody in flow cytometry. Lastly, the effects of anthocyanins on thrombus formation in C57BL/6J mice were assessed using a FeCl 3 -induced intravital microscopy thrombosis model. Results: Both Cy-3-g and Dp-3-g significantly inhibited platelet aggregation induced by collagen and TRAP in gel-filtered platelets, and inhibited aggregation induced by ADP, TRAP and collagen in human and mouse PRP. These inhibitory functions were observed at Cy-3-g and Dp-3-g doses as low as 0.5\u03bcM. Cy-3-g and Dp-3-g also reduced the surface expression of activated GPIIbIIIa on resting human platelets in a dose-dependent manner. These compounds also markedly reduced platelet adhesion and aggregation in perfusion chamber assays at both low and high shear rates. Using intravital microscopy, we further demonstrated that Cy-3-g and Dp-3-g decreased platelet deposition, destabilized thrombi, and prolonged the time required for thrombus formation and vessel occlusion. Conclusions: our data clearly demonstrated for the first time that anthocyanin compounds directly inhibited platelet activation, adhesion and aggregation, as well as attenuated thrombus growth at both arterial and veinous shear stresses. These effects on platelets likely contribute to the protective effects of anthocyanins against thrombosis and CVDs. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
