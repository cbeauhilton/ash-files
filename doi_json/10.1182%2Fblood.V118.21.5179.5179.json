    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5179 Background: JAK2V617F and JAK2 exon12 mutations in haematopoietic cells were partially responsible for the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN).But it was still unclear whether bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), the significant component of hemopoiesis microenvironment, were participated in the pathogenesis of MPN. Objective: To study the physiopathology characteristics and analyze JAK2 mutation in BMSCs from MPN patients. Methods: By searched for the JAK2V617F mutation and exon 12 mutation in 135 MPN patients' blood /bone marrow samples, 20 patients with JAK2V617F mutation, 10 patients with JAK2 exon 12 mutation, 5 JAK2-mutation-negetive patients and 10 healthy donors were recruited. The phenotype, mesenchymal differentiation capacity, expression of hematopoietic and immune molecules and JAK2 mutation of isolated bone marrow BMSCs were detected. Results: BMSCs derived from the four groups were found to be similar in morphology, differentiation ability and expression of hematopoietic and immune molecules. Primary study indicated that the isolated BMSCs from patients groups were not able to harbor JAK2 mutation in spite of positive or negative JAK2 mutation in blood /bone marrow samples. Conclusion: BMSCs from MPN patients had similar biological characteristics to healthy donors, and BMSCs were not likely involved in pathogenesis of MPN.
