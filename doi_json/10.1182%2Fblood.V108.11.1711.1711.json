    "abstract_text": "Tightly associated factors V a and X a serve as the essential prothrombin-activating complex whose assembly is triggered by occupancy of phosphatidylserine (PS) regulatory sites on both proteins. Factor V a C2 domain contains a binding site for soluble, short chain PS (C6PS) that includes the indole moieties of Trp 2063 /Trp 2064 at the apex of a loop (\u201cspike-1\u201d) ( Srivastava A, Quinn-Allen MA, Kim SW, Kane WH, Lentz BR. Biochemistry , 2001 , 40 (28): 8246 \u201355 ). Our recent data show that there is a C6PS site in the factor V a2 C1 domain that serves as a regulatory site for assembly and/or activity of the FV a2 -FX a complex (Majumder R, Quinn-Allen MA, Kane WH & Lentz BR. Manuscript in Preparation). This C6PS-binding site also involves aromatic and hydrophobic residues (Tyr 1956 /Tyr 1957 ) located in a homologous loop whose apex is termed \u201cspike 3\u201d. In order to identify the amino acid residues in the C1 domain that contribute to the PS-mediated cofactor activity of factor V a2 , charged and hydrophobic residues predicted to be exposed in FV a2 -C1 domain were mutated to alanine in clusters of 1\u20133 mutations per construct. The resultant 20 mutants (R1880A, D1892A, (K1896,E1899)A, (F1900,L1901,Y1903)A, (E1905,R1907)A, Y1917A, (E1923,K1924)A, (K1941,E1942)A, (K1954,H1955)A, (Y1956,L1957)A, Y1956A, L1957A, K1958A, E1964A, K1980A, D1995A, R2019A, (R2023,R2027)A, R2023A, R2027A,) and factor V wild type were expressed in Cos-7 cells followed by activation with thrombin, partial purification and concentration using HiTrap SP HP columns. The specific activities of all factor V a mutants were greater than 70% of wild type, with concentrations in the 1.5-7\u03bcM range. Recently it has been shown that two mutants (Y1956, L1957)A and (R2023,R2027)A showed decreased binding to immobilized PS and a selective decrease in prothrombinase activity on membranes containing 5% PS ( Saleh M, Peng W, Quinn-Allen MA, Macedo-Ribeiro S, Fuentes-Prior P, Bode W & Kane WH. Thromb. Haemost.  2004 , 91 : 16 \u201327 ). Here we report the rate of prothrombin activation in the presence of 1 nM factor X a , 5 nM factorV a2 (mutants and wild type) and 400 mM C6PS. Enhancement of cofactor activity ( E ) of factor V a -C1 wild type and mutants by C6PS was measured using the following equation ( Zhai X, Srivastava A, Drummond DC, Daleke D and Lentz BR. Biochemistry . 2002 , 41 : 5675 \u201384 ): \\[E=\\ (r_{Xa.Va.PL}/r_{Xa.PL})/(r_{Xa.Va}/r_{Xa})\\] Here, r Xa\u00b7Va\u00b7PL is the rate of prothrombin activation measured as the initial slope of the rate of change of normalized DAPA fluorescence with time by enzyme in the presence of factor V a and lipid, and other terms are defined analogously. The cofactor activities of (Y1956, L1957) A, Y1956A and L1957A were drastically reduced (values are 1.1, 4.2 and 5.1 respectively) relative to the cofactor activity of the wild type factor Va 2 (15). The cofactor activities of (R2023, R2027) A, E1964A and (K1954, H1955) A were also reduced but to a lesser extent (values are 8, 10.6 and 12 respectively). We plan to monitor the binding of these mutants to C6PS and to factor X a in the presence of C6PS in order to determine the role of these mutations on the assembly and activity of prothrombinase.
