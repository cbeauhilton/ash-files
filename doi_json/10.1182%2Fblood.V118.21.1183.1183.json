    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1183 Only \u223c10% of individuals carrying the common venous thrombosis risk factor, Factor V Leiden (FVL) will develop venous thrombosis in their lifetime. In order to identify potential FVL modifier genes, we performed a sensitized dominant ENU mutagenesis screen, based on the perinatal synthetic lethal thrombus previously observed in mice homozygous for FVL (FVQ/Q) and hemizygous for tissue factor pathway inhibitor deficiency (Tfpi+/\u2212). The genome-wide ENU mutagenesis screen was performed by crossing ENU-treated male FVQ/Q mice with FVQ/+ Tfpi+/\u2212 females. Surviving G1 offspring were analyzed to identify survivors with the otherwise lethal FVQ/Q Tfpi+/\u2212 genotype. As proof of concept, we demonstrated that reduced tissue factor (Tf+/\u2212) suppresses the lethal FVQ/Q Tfpi+/\u2212 phenotype, suggesting that mutations at Tf should be among the suppressor genes identified by our screen. Analysis of 7,128 G1 offspring (\u223c2X genome coverage) identified 98 FVQ/Q Tfpi+/\u2212 mice that survived to weaning. Fourteen FVQ/Q Tfpi+/\u2212 G1 mice exhibited successful transmission of a putative suppressor mutation to two or more FVQ/Q Tfpi+/\u2212 G2 offspring. Extensive genotyping of mice from an expanded genetic cross from one of these lines mapped a candidate suppressor locus to a chromosome 3 region encompassing the TF gene (LOD=4.93). With continued improvements in next generation sequencing technologies, we have now applied whole exome sequencing to analysis of 8 of the remaining 13 lines. The entire DNA coding region (the \u201cexome\u201d, totaling 49.6 Mb of DNA sequence) from a progeny-tested member of each line was captured using the Agilent SureSelect mouse exome capture system. Whole-exome sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq high-throughput sequencer yielded 12\u201315 gigabases of sequence data per sample, corresponding to an average of \u223c200 fold sequencing coverage for each nucleotide position. Variant analysis using the Gene Analysis Toolkit revealed the presence of a small number of high confidence novel heterozygous (dominant) variants in each sample. Each of these heterozygous variants is a candidate suppressor mutation and these are presently being tested in remaining FVQ/Q Tfpi+/\u2212 mice from each respective line. Based on previous studies where ENU-induced mutations in mice have been identified, we anticipate the identification of putative exomic mutations in approximately 80% of tested suppressor lines. Identification of these mutations should provide candidate modifier genes for FVL and other human hemostatic disorders.
