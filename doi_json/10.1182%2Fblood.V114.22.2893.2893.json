Several SNPs, including rs12343867, tag this haplotype. We performed rs12343867 SNP analysis in a consecutive cohort of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) in order to study the clinical and JAK2 V617F allele burden correlates of the particular SNP genotype. Methods: Study patients were recruited form the Mayo Clinic database for ET. Molecular studies were performed on DNA extracted from stored bone marrow. rs12343867 SNP genotyping was performed by a commercially available Taqman assay. Quantitative JAK2 V617F analysis was done according to previously published methods. Standard statistical methods were used to test significance of associations between SNP genotype and other variables. Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method and comparisons made by the log-rank test. Cox regression model was used for multivariable analysis. Results: 226 patients with ET were studied (median age 57, range 14-91; 145 females). Median hemoglobin, leukocyte and platelet counts at initial diagnosis were 13.8 g/dL, 9.7 \u00d7 10 9 /L and 1000 \u00d7 10 9 /L, respectively. 118 patients (52%) were JAK2 V617F positive and among them, 90 (76%) displayed JAK2 V617F allele burden of < 10% (low allele burden group) and the median (range) mutant allele burden in the remaining 28 patients (higher allele burden group) was 12% (12-68). As expected, JAK2 V617F-positive cases, compared to their mutation-negative counterparts, were older (p=0.006) and displayed higher hemoglobin (p=0.0001) and leukocyte (p<0.0001) counts and lower platelet (0.03) count. The rs12343867 genotype distributions were C/C 15%, C/T 53% and T/T 33% (expected frequency in the HapMap-CEU listed control population is \u223c 6%, 46% and 48%, respectively). The corresponding figures in JAK2 V617F positive/negative cases were 17%%/11%, 53%/53%, 30%/36% (p=0.29). Unlike the case with JAK2 V617F mutational status, rs12343867 SNP genotype did not correlate with age (p=0.69), hemoglobin level (p=0.47), leukocyte count (p=0.25) or platelet count (p=0.33). Patients were followed for a median of 7.4 years and during this period 56 (25%) deaths were documented. rs12343867 SNP genotype did not correlate with survival (Figure). Similarly, survival did not correlate with the presence or absence of JAK2 V617F. However, patients with higher JAK2 V617F allele burden displayed a shorter survival with borderline significance, during multivariable analysis that included age as a covariate. Conclusion: The current study shows the JAK2 haplotype enrichment in a large series of ET patients. However, the particular phenomenon was not significantly different between JAK2 V617F positive and negative cases, which suggests specific haplotype association with the disease rather than the mutation. Consistent with this contention, rs12343867 genotype did not correlate with clinical or laboratory variables that typically associate with JAK2 V617F mutational status. Furthermore, unlike the case with primary myelofibrosis, rs12343867 SNP genotype did not correlate with survival, an observation that is not surprising considering the lower level of complexity in molecular pathogenesis in ET compared to PMF.
