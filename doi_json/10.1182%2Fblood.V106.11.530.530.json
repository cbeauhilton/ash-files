    "abstract_text": "The mechanism of thrombin-induced angiogenesis is poorly understood. Using a gene chip array to investigate the pro-malignant phenotype of thrombin-stimulated cells we observed that thrombin (0.5\u20131 u/ml/24 hr) upregulates GRO-\u03b1 168 fold in an undifferentiated mouse cell line (UMCL). Thrombin-induced GRO-\u03b1 upregulation was also observed in several tumor cell lines [murine B16F10 melanoma and 4T1 breast CA, human DU145 and PC3 prostate CA, human MCF7 breast CA, as well as human umbilical vein (HUVEC) and brain microvascular endothelial cells] by mRNA and protein analysis. Thrombin enhanced the secretion of GRO-\u03b1 from PC3 and MCF7 cells 25\u201364 fold at 24 hrs. GRO-\u03b1 is a CXC chemokine oncogene that binds to a seven transmembrane receptor, CXCR2 and enhances growth, chemotaxis and metastasis of several tumor cell lines. GRO-\u03b1 induced metastasis is associated with increased angiogenesis. To obtain a better understanding of neoangiogenesis mechanisms involved in the thrombin-stimulated malignant phenotype we examined the effect of anti-GRO-\u03b1 Ab on thrombin-induced angiogenesis in the CAM assay at 72 hrs. GRO-\u03b1 (5ug/egg/day) enhanced angiogenesis 2.2 fold (n=19, p=0.005), providing direct evidence for GRO-\u03b1 as an angiogenic growth factor. Thrombin also enhanced angiogenesis 2.7 fold (n=9, p=0.01), however, anti-GRO-\u03b1 Ab inhibited thrombin-induced angiogenesis to basal control levels whereas IgG control Ab had no effect (n=9). Similar results were obtained with an endothelial (HUVEC) cord formation assay in matrigel. Thrombin-induced cord formation increased 1.5 fold (n=20, p2-4 fold) KDR, Ang-2, MMP-1, MMP-2, CXCR2 and CD31 (angiogenesis marker) protein compared to control cells (n=3). Similar upregulation of GRO-\u03b1 was also noted in tumor cells (PC3, B16F10 and 4T1 cells) (n=3). All of the thrombin/TRAP gene upregulations were completely inhibited by anti-GRO-\u03b1 Ab and unaffected by irrelevant Ab-treated cells (n=3). bFGF and VEGF had no effect on upregulation of GRO-\u03b1 (immunoblot) yet they upregulated other vascular growth factors, demonstrating specificity for thrombin. Similar inhibition of thrombin upregulation of vascular growth factors was noted in siRNA GRO-\u03b1 knock down (KD) HUVEC as well as 4T1 and B16F10 cells. In vivo tumor growth studies in wild-type mice injected with subcutaneous GRO-\u03b1 KD 4T1 cells revealed 2-4 fold impaired tumor growth, spontaneous metastasis and angiogenesis which was not affected by endogenous thrombin (hirudin treatment). Thus thrombin-induced angiogenesis requires the upregulation of GRO-\u03b1. Thrombin upregulation of GRO-\u03b1 in tumor cells as well as endothelial cells, contributes to tumor angiogenesis.",
