    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1401 Poster Board I-423 Background: Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a disease which largely affects older adults, for whom optimal therapy is unclear. Evidence-based strategies to identify those older adults who may tolerate and benefit from standard therapies are lacking. Objective: Test the utility of a bedside geriatric assessment (GA) to detect impairment in multiple geriatric domains among older adults initiating induction chemotherapy for AML. Methods: Ongoing prospective study of patients \u226560 years of age with newly diagnosed AML and planned induction chemotherapy admitted to Wake Forest University. Bedside geriatric assessment (GA) was performed during inpatient work-up for AML. GA measures included the Modified Mini-Mental Status Exam (3MS), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Distress thermometer, Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI), Pepper Assessment Tool for Disability ([PAT-D], includes self- reported activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and mobility questions), Short Physical Performance Battery ([SPPB], includes timed 4-meter walk, chair stands, standing balance), and grip strength. Results: 26 of 29 eligible patients enrolled between 1/2009 and 8/2009. The median age was 68 (range 60-82) years, and 42.3% were female. Prior myelodysplastic syndrome was present in 34.6%, with intermediate or poor-risk cytogenetics in 95.6%. Baseline laboratory measures included white blood cell count (mean 17.3\u00d710 3 /mm 3 , SD 25.0\u00d710 3 ), hemoglobin (mean 9.2g/dl, SD 1.5), lactate dehydrogenase (mean 282.4 U/L, SD 168.8). Mean baseline GA scores included: 3MS 83.0 (SD 14.7), CES-D 9.4 (SD 9.3), Distress 3.8 (SD 3.4), HCT-CI 1.3 (SD 1.6), PAT-D 1.4 (SD 0.7), SPPB 7.1 (SD 3.9), grip strength 32.4 kilograms (SD 9.2). Although 84.6% of subjects had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance score <2, a substantial proportion met criteria for impairment in multiple geriatric domains.  Characteristic . % impaired . Poor performance status (ECOG\u22652) 15.4 Comorbidity (HCT-CI score >1) 38.5 Impairment in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) 34.6 Impairment in objective physical function (SPPB<9) 60.0 Cognitive impairment (3MS<77) 15.4 Depression (CES-D \u226516) 23.1 Distress (score \u22654) 50.0 Characteristic . % impaired . Poor performance status (ECOG\u22652) 15.4 Comorbidity (HCT-CI score >1) 38.5 Impairment in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) 34.6 Impairment in objective physical function (SPPB<9) 60.0 Cognitive impairment (3MS<77) 15.4 Depression (CES-D \u226516) 23.1 Distress (score \u22654) 50.0 View Large Conclusions: GA measures detect abnormalities which are not adequately reflected by the ECOG performance score in older adults with AML. Future analyses from this ongoing study will evaluate whether these abnormalities are independently associated with treatment-related morbidity and survival.
