    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3795 Recent studies suggest a powerful prognostic value for plasma cytokine levels in primary myelofibrosis (IL-2R, IL-8, IL-12, IL-15 and CXCL10) and large cell lymphoma (IL-2R, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, CXCL9 and CXCL10). In order to examine the possibility of a similar phenomenon in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), we used multiplex ELISA to measure 30 plasma cytokines in 78 patients with primary MDS. Compared to normal controls ( n =35), the levels of 19 cytokines were significantly altered. Multivariable analysis identified increased levels of CXCL10 (p<0.01), IL-7 (p=0.02) and IL-6 (p=0.07) as predictors of shortened survival; the survival association remained significant when the Cox model was adjusted for the international prognostic scoring system (IPSS), age, transfusion-need or thrombocytopenia. MDS patients with normal plasma levels of CXCL10, IL-7 and IL-6 lived significantly longer (median survival 76 months) than those with elevated levels of at least one of the three cytokines (median survival 25 months) (p<0.01). Increased levels of IL-6 were associated with inferior leukemia-free survival, independent of other prognostic factors (p=0.01). Comparison of plasma cytokines between MDS ( n =78) and primary myelofibrosis ( n =127) revealed a significantly different pattern of abnormalities. These observations reinforce the concept of distinct and prognostically-relevant plasma cytokine signatures in hematologic malignancies.
