    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization is impaired in patients receiving chemotherapy but, as far as we know there is no data about the impact of chemotherapy on different PB progenitor cell subpopulations. AIM: to ascertain whether or not immature or committed progenitor cell are affected by chemotherapy prior PBSC mobilization in NHL patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: a total of 27 PB samples from NHL patients and 36 PB samples from healthy donors were studied. Immunophenotypic analysis of CD34+ cell subpopulations was performed using the following four colour combinations of monoclonal antibodies (FITC/PE/PC5/APC): CD90/CD133/CD38/CD34 and CD71/CD13/CD45/CD34. In order to study committed progenitor cells \u201cin vitro\u201d, standard colony-forming assays were used and, in order to investigate the behaviour of the uncommitted progenitors Delta Assays of plastic adherent progenitor cells (P\u0394) were performed. RESULTS: The comparison between NHL patients and healthy donors is shown in Table 1. The relationship between data obtained by flow cytometry and cultures was statistically significant (p0.568) for all the progenitors analysed.

Only granulomonocytic progenitors analysed by a functional approach seemed to be preserved."
