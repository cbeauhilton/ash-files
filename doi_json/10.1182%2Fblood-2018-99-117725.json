    "abstract_text": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of central nervous system (CNS) is a rare complication after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), which is easily misdiagnosed and has limited treatment and poor efficacy. In this study, we reported two children(1 case of severe aplastic anemia and 1 case of acute myeloid leukemia) who were subjected to the secondary haploid hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of another door after the first implantation failure. Two patients developed epileptic seizures during hematopoietic recovery. Peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid cytokines were detected and diagnosed as acute GVHD in the central nervous system. The cytokine elevation is mainly IL-6(IL-6 level in peripheral blood was 2276.25 pg/ml, and in cerebrospinal fluid was 2353.89pg/ml of case 1). We administered multiply consecutive plasmapheresis, intravenous infusion of tocilizumab combined with intrathecal injection of tocilizumab and dexamethasone. The epileptic symptoms of 2 cases are effectively controlled after the first dose. The IL-6 levels in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid of both patients decreased significantly after 4(IL-6 level in peripheral blood was 6.74 pg/ml, and in cerebrospinal fluid was 195.72pg/ml of case 1) and 5 doses, respectively. Central nervous system aGVHD is prone to hematopoietic recovery after secondary transplantation; intrathecal injection of tocilizumab is safe and effective in the treatment of central nervous system aGVHD with elevated IL-6 mainly, which is worth further exploring.
