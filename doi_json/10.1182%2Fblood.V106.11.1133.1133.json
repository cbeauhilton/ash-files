    "abstract_text": "Burkitts Lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive form of non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) that accounts for 50% of childhood cases of NHL, yet is rare in adults. B symptoms, advanced stage and extranodal disease are risk factors previously associated with poor survival. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is often used because of either incomplete or short duration of remission with standard therapy yet little published data for HCT and BL exists. We evaluated the comparative safety and efficacy of a cyclophosphamide/total body irradiation-containing myeloablative conditioning regimen followed by either an autologous HCT (autoHCT) or allogeneic related donor HCT (alloHCT) in 38 patients who received transplants between October 1975 and June 2004. Twenty-five patients (median age 16 years [range, 4\u201365]) underwent an autoHCT; 13 patients (median age 13 [range, 4\u201362]) received an alloHCT. The median number of conventional chemotherapy regimens prior to transplant was 2 (range 1\u20134); the median duration of first complete remission (CR) was 0.4 years (range, 0\u20138.8). The majority of patients were in a complete remission (CR) at transplant (auto HCT - 16 [64%] [40% CR1]), alloHCT - 9 [69%] [23% CR1]). Patient demographics, disease characteristics at diagnosis, at relapse and at transplant were comparable between the two groups except for a greater incidence of high risk factors, including B symptoms, advanced stage at diagnosis, and extranodal (bone marrow and central nervous system) disease in the alloHCT group. The median follow up is 7 years (range 1\u201312) and 24 years (range 2\u201327) for the autoHCT and alloHCT groups, respectively. Post-transplant, 71% of auto-HCT and 75% of the alloHCT recipients obtained a CR. The 1-year treatment related mortality (TRM) was comparable in the two groups: 8% and 15% for the autoHCT and alloHCT groups, respectively (p=NS). Ten-year progression free survival (PFS) was 21% (95% CI, 4\u201338%) and overall survival (OS) 23% (95% CI, 5\u201341%) after autoHCT compared to 31% (95% CI, 6\u201366%) and 31% (95% CI, 6\u201366%) for alloHCT (p=NS). Six patients in autoHCT group and 3 in alloHCT survive disease free between 1 and 27 years; 5 survive beyond 10 years and 3 beyond 15 years from HCT. Donor choice did not significantly alter PFS. Two factors were predictive of superior PFS: fewer chemotherapy regimens prior to transplantation (1 vs \u2265 2) and CR (vs relapsed/persistent disease) at time of transplant. Patients with high risk factors more commonly underwent alloHCT, yet outcomes were comparable to autoHCT, suggesting that a powerful and durable graft versus lymphoma effect exists. These results demonstrate that prolonged remissions can be obtained with either auto or alloHCT, especially for high risk patients in CR. New approaches for patients in relapse are needed to improve these outcomes.",
