    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1547 Poster Board I-570 Introduction Levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol have been correlated with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-aggregation, anti-coagulant and pro-fibrinolytic activities. We hypothesized that lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides have important roles in sickle cell disease pathogenesis. Patients and Methods A prospective study of biochemical and hematological analyses of 152 steady-state children with sickle cell disease and 132 healthy subjects using immunochemistry, immunoassay and electronic cell counter respectively. Clinical data were collected from patient medical records. Data analyses were performed using Prism 5.01 (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA), EPIinfo 6.04 (CDC, Atlanta, Georgia) and STATA SE 10 software (StataCorp, Texas, USA). Results There was a significant positive association of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with hemoglobin (p<0.001), hematocrit (p<0.001) and total cholesterol (p<0.001) and a negative association with reticulocytes (p=0.046), leukocytes (p=0.015), monocytes (p=0.004) and platelets (p=0.005), bilirubins [total bilirubin (p<0.001), direct bilirubin (p<0.001) and indirect bilirubin (p<0.001], iron (p<0.001), aminotransferases [aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.004), alanine aminotransferase (p=0.035)], lactate dehydrogenase (p<0.001), urea (p=0.030), alpha 1-antitrypsin (p<0.001), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p=0.003), triglycerides (p=0.005) and hemoglobin S (p=0.002). Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was associated with cardiac abnormalities ( p < 0.025 ), pneumonia history (p=0.033) and blood transfusion use (p=0.025). Triglycerides (p=0.047), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p=0.044), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p=0.033), total cholesterol (p=0.007), alpha 1-antitrypsin ( p =0.040) and ferritin ( p =0.008) levels were associated with cholelithiasis. Conclusion We hypothesize that some SCD patients can have a specific dyslipidemic subphenotype characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, high VLDL-C and low plasma LDL-C and HDL-C in association with other biomarkers, including those related to inflammation. This represents an important step toward a more reliable clinical prognosis. We suggest further studies and continued research into new mechanisms involving this complex network of markers in order to establish their role in SCD pathogenesis.
