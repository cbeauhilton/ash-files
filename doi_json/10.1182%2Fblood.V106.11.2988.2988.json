    "abstract_text": "The E2A-HLF fusion transcription factor generated by the t(17;19)(q22;p13) translocation is found in a small population of pro-B cell ALL. Patients associated with this chimera share distinct clinical features such as hypercalcemia, coagulopathy and very poor prognosis due to resistance to intensive chemotherapy including aggressive conditioning for BMT, all of which are unusual for this type of ALL. We have previously demonstrated that inhibition of the trans -activation potential of the E2A-HLF chimera by the dominant negative mutant results in apoptosis in t(17;19) + ALL cells but does not affect cell cycle. Moreover, E2A-HLF blocks apoptosis induced by cytokine deprivation in IL-3-dependent cells, suggesting that this fusion protein contributes to leukemogenesis by substituting for the anti-apoptotic function of cytokines. The present study shows that survivin is a downstream target molecule of E2A-HLF. Four t(17;19) + ALL cell lines expressed survivin at high levels and down-regulation of E2A-HLF function by the dominant negative mutant suppressed survivin expression. In addition, forced expression of E2A-HLF in Nalm-6, a t(17;19) \u2212 ALL cell line, up-regulated survivin expression. Survivin is known to be expressed predominantly in the G2/M phase. Indeed, separation of the fractions enriched for in each phase of the cell cycle using a counterflow centrifugal elutriator revealed G2/M phase-dominant survivin expression in t(17;19) \u2212 ALL cells including Nalm-6. In t(17;19) + ALL cells, however, survivin was expressed throughout the cell cycle. Moreover, Nalm-6 cells forced to express E2A-HLF showed cell cycle-independent survivin expression. Reporter assay revealed that E2A-HLF induced luciferase activity by transfecting with each reporter construct containing the survivin promoter at a different length from the initial ATG, suggesting that E2A-HLF induces survivin expression at the transcriptional level, but not by direct binding of E2A-HLF to the survivin promoter. To test whether survivin plays anti-apoptotic roles in t(17:19) + cells, we used a survivin mutant lacking a phosphorylation site (T34A-survivin) and considered to inhibit survivin function in a dominant negative manner. T34A-survivin induced massive apoptosis throughout the cell cycle in t(17;19) + cells. In contrast, T34A-survivin in t(17;19) \u2212 cells induced cell death in only a small population in G2/M phase. In addition to caspase-dependent pathways, T34A-survivin induced apoptosis in t(17;19) + ALL cells through caspase-independent pathways, in which apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocated from cytoplasm to the nucleus. These results indicate that cell cycle-independent up-regulation of survivin by the E2A-HLF chimera is indispensable for the survival of t(17;19) + ALL cells, and that inhibition of survivin may offer an effective therapeutic strategy against this refractory ALL.",
