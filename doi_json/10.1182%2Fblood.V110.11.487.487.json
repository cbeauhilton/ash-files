    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Deletions in chromosomal band 13q14.3 distal to RB1 occur in a variety of human neoplasms like B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), indicating a tumor suppressor mechanism in this region. Intriguingly, several characteristics of the region of interest point to an epigenetic pathomechanism: candidate genes lack point mutations, yet these genes are downregulated in tumors, the presence of large non-coding RNA genes in 13q14.3 is reminiscent of imprinted regions where only one gene copy is active. The data we show here led us to propose a novel oncogenic mechanism where already in healthy tissue only one gene copy is active while one gene copy is randomly chosen for silencing. Loss of the single active copy is then sufficient for complete loss of gene function in tumor cells. Currently we are trying to identify the (epi-)genetic element that controls the whole locus. AIM: Identification of the epigenetic regulatory mechanism localized in 13q14.3. METHODS and RESULTS: We performed FISH analyses of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell lines to assess replication timing and chromatin packaging of the critical region. In line with an imprinting mechanism, we find that the two copies of the critical region replicate asynchronously and/or show delayed chromatid segregation, suggesting differential chromatin packaging of the two copies of 13q14.3. Next, we found by sequencing of SNPs that 13q14.3 candidate genes are expressed from one copy only in healthy probands. However, expression originated from either the maternal or paternal copy, excluding an imprinting mechanism. We could also show a functional interconnection of DNA methylation and gene expression, as demethylating agents and histone hyperacetylation induced biallelic expression. However, replication timing was not affected. Currently we are employing array- and capillary electrophoresis-based analysis of DNA-methylation (aPRIMES and bioCOBRA) and chromatin-immunoprecipitation on arrayed CpG-libraries (chIP on chip) with antibodies specific for histone modifications in order to identify the epigenetic element regulating the critical region. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that differential replication timing represents an early epigenetic mark that distinguishes the two copies of 13q14.3, resulting in differential chromatin packaging and monoallelic expression. This has profound effects for the tumor suppressor mechanism localized in 13q14.3: Deletion of the single active copy of the region at 13q14.3, which is detected in more than 50% of CLL tumors, will suffice for complete loss of tumor suppressor function, as the remaining gene copies are epigentically silenced. In addition, we are currently identifying the locus control region that orchestrates gene expression in the critical region. Thus, we provide a model for the pathomechanism of 13q14.3 in CLL by the interaction of genetic lesions and epigenetic silencing."
