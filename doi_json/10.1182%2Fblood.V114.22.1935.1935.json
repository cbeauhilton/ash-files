    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1935 Poster Board I-958 Introduction: Several reports have identified soluble-form IL-2 receptor a\u0301 (sIL-2Ra\u0301) as a significant prognostic factor in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated using chemotherapy, particularly in rituximab-containing regimens. However, the clinical significance of sIL-2R is not fully understood, as only small populations have been studied to date. The rationale for increasing of serum level of sIL-2Ra\u0301 in non-Hodgkin lymphoma is also unclear. Patients and Methods: We analyzed 409 patients newly diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) between January 2001 and July 2008. Treatment comprised CHOP-like regimen with (R-CHOP-like) or without rituximab. Levels of sIL-2R were evaluated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at diagnosis. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS, death from any cause, relapse and refractory disease) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods and survival was compared using log-rank tests. To estimate the survival impact of several factors, including sIL-2Ra\u0301 level, PS, LDH, B symptoms, extranodal sites \u22652 and age, we performed multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards. In 166 of 409 patients, CD25 (IL-2Ra\u0301) expression on tumor cells was evaluated using a lymphoma sample from the lymph node, bone marrow, blood or other extranodal organ by flow cytometry. To estimate CD25 expression of tumor cell, CD45 bright cells (mature lymphocyte gate) were gated and considered positive if positivity was seen in >20% of the population excluding CD4-positive cells) using three-color flow cytometry. Results: Median age was 68 years (range, 17-91 years), males/females 1.18, and 28.9% of patients were treated with CHOP-like regimen and 60.2% with R-CHOP-like regimen. Clinical stage was I in 24.4%, II in 24.2%, III in 13.1%, and IV in 38.8%. International Prognostic Index (IPI) was Low in 33.5%, LI in 23.5%, HI in 18.7% and H in 24.3%. Median follow-up for CHOP-like and R-CHOP-like groups was 924 days (range, 16-2878 days) and 799 days (range, 29-2688 days), respectively. Median sIL-2Ra\u0301 value was 1360 U/L (range, 170-59,500 U/L). For the entire population, CR rate was 71.9%, 3-year OS was 67.6% and PFS was 58.8%. OS differed significantly between sIL-2R >1000 U/L and \u22641000 U/L, between >2000 U/L and \u22642000 U/L and between >3500 U/L and \u22643500 U/L, (p1000 U/L and \u22641000 U/L, between >2000 U/L and \u22642000 U/L and, between >3500 U/L and \u22643500 U/L (p3500 U/L is extremely poor even if treated with R-CHOP (53.2%). We showed that one rationale for increasing level of serum sIL-2Ra\u0301 level in DLBCL is to remove from the tumor cell surface. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
