    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3039 Poster Board II-1015 The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), with pathogenic aPL directed primarily against the cell surface protein \u03b22 glycoprotein I (\u03b22GPI), increased risk for thrombosis and cardiovascular events, and pregnancy morbidity. The endothelium is a critical direct target of aPL, which upregulate adhesion molecule expression and procoagulant activity. However, the molecular basis for aPL actions on endothelium is unknown. Nitric oxide (NO) generated by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) has potent antiadhesive and antithrombotic properties. In this study we determined if aPL-induced alterations in endothelial cell phenotype are mediated by aPL actions on eNOS. Normal human IgG (NHIgG) and polyclonal aPL were obtained from healthy adults and APS patients, respectively. We found that aPL prevented acetylcholine (Ach)- or VEGF-mediated attenuation of monocyte adhesion to cultured endothelial cells and this was reversed by an NO donor, indicating a role for eNOS antagonism. In contrast, NHIgG did not affect adhesion. Whereas NHIgG did not alter eNOS activation, stimulation of eNOS by VEGF and other agonists was fully antagonized by aPL. In mice, NO-dependent, Ach-induced increases in carotid vascular conductance were unaffected by NHIgG but impaired by aPL, indicating that these processes are operative in vivo. Additional studies in culture showed that aPL attenuates eNOS activation by inhibiting Ser1179 phosphorylation, deprivation of \u03b22GPI prevented aPL inhibition of eNOS, and monoclonal antibody against \u03b22GPI mimicked the effects of aPL. Furthermore, receptor-associated protein (RAP) antagonism of LDL receptors, which are known to bind dimerized \u03b22GPI, prevented aPL inhibition of eNOS in culture, and mice null for the LDL receptor apolipoprotein receptor 2 (apoER2) were protected from aPL inhibition of eNOS in vivo. Moreover, aPL-stimulated increases in leukocyte-endothelial adhesion were absent in both eNOS-/- and apoER2-/- mice. Thus, aPL-induced increases in leukocyte-endothelial adhesion are caused by eNOS antagonism, which is due to impaired S1179 phosphorylation mediated by \u03b22GPI and apoER2. Novel therapies for APS can now be developed targeting these mechanisms. Disclosures Thomas: NIcox Research Institute: Research Funding.
