    "abstract_text": "Platelet activation at the site of injury is tied to signal transduction events that are mediated by protein kinases and phosphatases. Reversible tyrosine, serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) phosphorylation-dependent assembly and/or disassembly of effector (cytoskeletal, signaling and adaptor) protein complexes propagate signaling downstream of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Compared to kinases, the contribution of Ser/Thr phosphatases and its effectors in GPCR signaling studies is not well explored. Our previous studies had revealed that the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1\u03b3 (PP1c\u03b3) support GPCR signaling and thrombus formation. Since cell signaling networks are dependent on protein-protein interactions, we sought to identify the potential effectors of PP1c\u03b3. We employed yeast two-hybrid interaction studies with the full length PP1c\u03b3 fused to GAL4 activating domain as bait and screened human bone marrow library. A novel interaction of PP1c\u03b3 with a protein called G\u03b21 ( GNB1 ) was identified. G\u03b21 is a component of the heterotrimeric G proteins like the G\u03b1 and couple to GPCR. However, unlike G\u03b1 subunits, G\u03b21 is unexplored in platelets. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) studies validated PP1c\u03b3-G\u03b21 interaction in 293 cells expressing PP1c\u03b3-HA and G\u03b21-FLAG. Importantly, G\u03b21 interacted with all the PP1c isoforms, suggesting that G\u03b21 could target all PP1c isoforms to the GPCR complex. Purified PP1c bound to recombinant G\u03b21-GST protein but not to GST protein, indicating that the in vitro interaction of PP1c with G\u03b21 was direct and independent of G\u03b1 and G\u03b3 subunits. A small molecule inhibitor of G protein \u03b2\u03b3, gallein decreased thrombin-induced human platelet aggregation and adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen. There is a paucity of G\u03b21 -/- platelets because G\u03b21 -/- mice die within 2 days of birth due to microencephaly. siRNA mediated depletion of G\u03b21 in murine megakaryocytes reduced PAR4-activating peptide induced soluble fibrinogen binding to \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 . These studies suggest a functional role for G\u03b21 in GPCR signaling. PP1c co-immunoprecipitated with G\u03b21 in resting platelets and agonist (thrombin and ADP) treatment under non-stirring conditions induced dissociation of PP1c from G\u03b21. These studies indicate that G\u03b21-PP1c complex in platelets is responsive to agonist. Furthermore, PP1c and G\u03b21 associated with P2Y12 receptor in resting but not agonist activated platelets in a co-IP assay, suggesting a role for this complex in G protein signaling. Finally, agonist induced dissociation of PP1c from G\u03b21 correlated with the association of PP1c with the downstream GPCR effector phospholipase C \u03b23 (PLC\u03b23) with a concomitant dephosphorylation of PLC\u03b23 at Ser 1105 . Since previous studies have revealed that PLC\u03b23 activity is inhibited by Ser 1105 phosphorylation, our observation suggest that agonist-induced association of PP1c with PLC\u03b23 facilitates dephosphorylation and activation of PLC\u03b23. These studies highlight a coupling of GPCR signaling with the phosphatase driven signal transduction during platelet activation. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
