    "abstract_text": "Interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (del(5q)) is the most common chromosomal abnormality in MDS. The extent of individual defects vary, which may account for observed clinical diversity. Del(5q) pathogenesis has been related to haploinsufficiency of genes contained in the common deleted regions (CDR), including RPS14 , miR-145/146a and SPARC . Driver mutations or pathogenic microdeletions were not identified for these genes, suggesting that multiple genes must function in combination to promote clonal evolution and phenotypic heterogeneity. Hence, we performed a comprehensive analysis of somatic mutations in genes located on chromosome 5 (chr5), both in patients with diploid 5q and in those with del(5q), to clarify the role of germline and somatic mutations in disease pathogenesis. In parallel, expression analysis was performed to correlate haploinsufficiency with the frequency of mutational events, in particular for diploid 5q cases. Applying SNP-array karyotyping to samples from 146 patients with del(5q), the lesion was identified in 5q31.1q33.1. Two retained regions (CRRs) were also observed in q11.1q14.2 (CRR1) and q34qter (CRR2). Lower-risk MDS is frequently affected by CDR, while in higher-risk MDS and secondary AML CRR1/2 are commonly co-involved. Using whole exome sequencing, we identified 11 hemizygous mutations located within the deleted area in del(5q) (N=59), while in cases diploid for 5q (N=330), 243 heterozygous mutations were found. One of the mutations discovered on chr5q afflicted a gene G3BP1 (5q33.1), located within the CDR and present in 2 patients. Both were missense mutations (one heterozygous and the other homo/hemizygous). A mutant case showed good responses to lenalidomide even though diploid 5. In addition, other somatic mutations of driver genes including TET2 , CUX1 and EZH2 were concomitantly observed. Whole transcriptome sequencing demonstrated hemizygous loss of G3BP1 resulting in haploinsufficiency. G3BP1 was haploinsufficient in 48% of RAEB as well as low-risk MDS cases with del(5q). Overall, defective G3BP1 is associated with shorter overall survival (P<.001) in AML, consistent with the reports that del(5q) is a worse prognostic factor in myeloid neoplasms with aggressive phenotype. G3BP1 is a nuclear RNA-binding protein and is ubiquitously expressed in bone marrow, CD34 + progenitors and leukemic cell lines. Furthermore, G3BP1 binds to TP53 and its expression leads to the redistribution of TP53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Similar to RPS14 , haploinsufficient of G3BP1 resulted in TP53 up-modulation. Moreover, low expression of G3BP1 in diploid 5q cases was indeed associated with higher TP53 expression. Next, we generated haploinsufficient G3BP1 cell lines using shRNA transduction. Decreased expression of G3BP1 led to growth inhibition and impaired colony formation by transduced cells lines and hematopoietic progenitor cells, respectively. Knockdown of G3BP1 in K562 cell line increased TP53 in the nucleus, and when treated with CPT11, DNA-damaged induced G1-arrest was more prominent in knockdown cells. Furthermore, after knockdown of G3BP1 in TP53 -null HL60 cells, we observed increased aneuploidy, suggesting that the loss of function of G3BP1 and TP53 may result in chromosomal instability. Most significantly, G3bp1 -/+ mice showed lower blood counts and defective, dysplastic hematopoiesis, similar to lower-risk MDS. As previously described, TP53 defects are associated with advanced disease but recently it became apparent that TP53 may be one of the most common somatic lesions found in the context of del(5q). We stipulate that loss of TP53 function might overcome TP53 tumor suppressor effects and induce leukemic evolution in the defective G3BP1 status. In our cohort, TP53 mutations were more frequently present in high-risk phenotype with G3BP1 haploinsufficient expression. In conclusion, novel somatic mutations of G3BP1 suggest that it could be a candidate gene associated with the clonal evolution of del(5q). Loss of function or low expression of G3BP1 has been shown to up-modulate TP53 and result in dysplasia and growth inhibition, hallmarks of early stages of MDS. Additional events constitute loss of function of TP53 , resulting in chromosomal instability, which is associated with leukemogenesis.
