    "abstract_text": "Ischemic cerebrovascular disease (ICD) is a multi-factorial entity whose anatomopathologic substrate is atherosclerosis. The inflammatory cells migrate to vascular endothelium and release chemokines such as interleukin 6 (IL6), resulting in the atheroma plaque development. The IL6 production induces acute phase proteins synthesis such as fibrinogen. Objective. The purpose of this case-control study is to analyze the ICD risk associated to the polymorphisms IL6-174 G/C and beta chain of fibrinogen-455 G/A (fibri-\u03b2-455). The association of these polymorphisms, classic vascular risks factors and ICD subtypes according to TOAST classification has also been explored. Methods and patients. A total of 159 ICD diagnosed patients (82 female and 77 male; mean age 67.7\u00b115) were analysed. They were matched for age (\u00b15 years) and sex with a control group (65.6\u00b114) without thrombotic history. AHT, DM, dyslipidaemia and smoking habit data were collected for each group. Polymorphisms were analysed by PCR-RFLP. Serum IL6 was measured by ELISA and fibrinogen by Clauss method. Statistic analysis was made with the SAS v9 software. Results. Genotype analysis showed a significant higher prevalence of the genotypes G/G and G/C IL6 -174 in the patients (OR: 1.49, IC 95%: 0.95\u20132.34, p: 0.049). By contrast, the fibri-\u03b2-455 genotypes were not different in patients and controls (p= 0.230). When the stroke subtypes were analysed, we found that IL6-174 G/C genotype was more frequent in cardioembolic (60.0%) and atherothrombotic ICD subtypes (58.3%). In relation to fibri-\u03b2-455 G/A, the A allele showed a increased prevalence in atherothrombotic stroke (43.2%) (p= 0.049). We observed an association between the dyslipidaemia and IL6-174 G/C polymorphism (p= 0.034) and smoking habit with fibri-\u03b2-455G/A (p= 0.072). No synergic relation were found between IL6-174 G/C and fibri-\u03b2-455 G/A. The G allele IL6-174 G/C carriers group presented higher serum IL6 levels than C allele carriers, 5.85 pg/ml (2.9\u201334.5) vs. 4.94pg/ml (2.5\u201311.4). Also, allele A fibri-\u03b2-455 G/A was associated with a higher fibrinogen levels than G allele, 329 mg/dl (210\u2013686) versus 280 mg/dl (107\u2013783). Conclusion. There is an association between-174 IL6 G/C polymorphism and ischemic stroke. By contrast, we did not find any association between fibri-\u03b2-455 G/A, and ICD. Besides, the analysis performed by ICD subtypes showed an association of this polymorphism and atherothrombotic subtype. These results suggest a relation between smoking habit and fibri-\u03b2-455 G/A, and dislypidaemia and-174 IL6 G/C polymorphism.",
