    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4717 Research on stimulatory and inhibitory factors present in the hematopoietic microenvironment promoted development of ex-vivo cell culture methods. Recent investigations strive to select natural and novel mitogenic substances within defined conditions to culture and harvest specific progenitor cells and cell lines. Optimal large scale cell expansion of HSCs remains to be developed. The present study documents ex-vivo human lymphocytes and platelet culture in autologous human blood plasma (BP) complemented with a novel ionic metal polysulphide. Resulting plasma is growth-factor rich (FRP) with a high platelet count (HPC) containing > 4.5\u00d710E6 plts/ul. Co-culture expansion for 3-days of normal peripheral blood cells from n=20 healthy individuals in FRP promotes lymphoid and platelet series stem cell lineage growth and differentiation. Cultured cells characterized using conventional hematology and flow cytometry methods on CD3, CD4, CD8, CD34, CD38, CD41, CD61 antigen bearing cells; and average values reported. Result analysis of CD3 and CD4 bearing cells before-after a 3-day culture indicates a 4 % and 18 % respective increase, while CD8 cell population decrease 7%. A stimulation response obtained on CD34 and CD38 cells with a 67.30% and 53.89 % respective increase. Cell growth of CD41 and CD61 antigen bearing cells increased 50.89 % and 69.22 %, respectively. Functional platelet counts (before-after culture) correspond with a 3\u20135 fold increase of original concentration, and presence of recently reported proto-platelets. Minimum and maximum values varied among studied population. Discrete elevation in Neutrophils and Granulocytes counts observed. Potential applications thought for immunosuppression, cancer and organ transplant. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
