    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3653 Introduction: Every other day (qod) factor VIII prophylaxis prevents joint bleeds in children with severe hemophilia A. Although three times weekly or qod prophylaxis is recommended by the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF), how widely these practices have been adopted is not known. Aim: We sought to define current prophylaxis practices at U.S. Hemophilic Treatment Centers (HTCs). Method: An email survey was distributed to U.S. HTCs, utilizing web-based membership rosters of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Hemophilia Thrombosis Research Society (HTRS). Results: Of 62 HTCs responding, prophylaxis is initiated on a three times weekly schedule in 29 (46.8%), twice weekly in 13 HTCs (21.0%), and once weekly in 20 HTCs (32.2%). Central venous catheters are used to infuse factor prophylactically at 55 HTCs (88.7%), including in 100% of children initiating prophylaxis at 19 HTCs (30.6%) and in 50% of those at 41 HTCs (66.1%), but avoided altogether at seven HTCs (11.3%). Prophylaxis is initiated after one or more bleeds in 56 HTCs (90.3%), but after the first bleed in only 28 HTCs (25.2%). Among 226 newborns with severe hemophilia A in 62 HTCs, 1.82 births/HTC/year, the median age at first bleed, excluding circumcision, is 7 months. Of the 113 (53.5%) who underwent circumcision, 62 (54.9%), bled. Conclusion: Despite a recommended standard of three times weekly prophylaxis, over half of surveyed HTCs do not follow these guidelines, and nearly one third begin prophylaxis on a once weekly schedule to delay or avoid the need for central venous access.
