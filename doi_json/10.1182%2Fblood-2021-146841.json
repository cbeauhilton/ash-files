    "abstract_text": "Background T-ALL/LBL represent a class of devastating hematologic cancers with high rates of relapse and mortality in both children and adults. Despite intensive multi-agent chemotherapy regimens, fewer than 50% of adults and 85% of children with T-ALL survive beyond five years. For those who relapse after initial therapy, salvage regimens induce remissions in only ~20-30% of cases, and survival is dismal. T-ALL/LBL is a genetically diverse group, but with universal overexpression of CD7, making this a suitable target for immunotherapy. Despite the success of CAR-T cells in B-cell malignancies, CAR-T cell development in T-cell malignancies has proven challenging due to fratricide and high risk of contamination of the genetically modified CAR-T product with the patient's malignant T cells. WU-CART-007 is a CD7-directed, genetically modified, allogeneic, 'off the shelf', fratricide-resistant chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell product for the treatment of CD7+ve hematologic malignancies. Methods This multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, Phase 1/2 study (NCT#04984356) of WU-CART-007 in patients \u2265 12 years old, with relapsed or refractory T-ALL/LBL is designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD; if no MTD defined) (Phase 1), and to investigate the preliminary anti-tumor activity, as measured by objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) (Phase 2). Phase 1 is comprised of a dose escalation segment and will proceed according to a standard 3+3 design testing up to 4 dose levels from 1 to 9 x 10 8 cells. Adolescent patients, ages 12-17, will be eligible for enrollment in Phase 1 Dose Escalation beginning at Dose level 3 and 4, and during Phase 2 Cohort Expansion. Upon reaching the MTD and/or RP2D, the Phase 2 portion comprised of the cohort expansion segment will be launched. A Simon's optimal two-stage design will be implemented to enroll patients (an interim analysis for futility in the first stage and the final analysis in the second stage) for Phase 2 dose expansion cohort to confirm safety and explore preliminary efficacy. All patients will receive a single infusion of WU-CART-007 cells on day 1 following a lymphodepleting conditioning therapy consisting of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide on days -5 to -3. Patients will be hospitalized for a minimum of 7 days following WU-CART-007 administration. Response will be assessed on Cycle 1 Day 28 (\u00b1 1 days), and at Months 3, 6, 12, and 24, by bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and PET/CT if indicated. Response will be defined as per modified NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2020.
