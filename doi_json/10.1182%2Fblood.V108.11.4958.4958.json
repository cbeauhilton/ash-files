    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Genomic aberrations provide information for the pathogenesis and clinical outcomes of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). We assessed whether genomic aberrations in CLL/SLL differ by absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and evaluated their prognostic significance in our series of patients with CLL/SLL. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of patients with CLL/SLL who presented to The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from 1985 to 2005. Patients were assessed by conventional bone marrow cytogenetics and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using probes for trisomy 12, ATM, LAMP1, D13S319, and P53 genes. Results: Cytogenetics and/or FISH analysis was performed in 1694 of 2189 consecutive patients with CLL/SLL. Patients with ALC < 5 \u00d7 10 9 /L had lower rates of genomic aberrations by cytogenetic and/or FISH analysis than did those with ALC \u2265 5 \u00d7 10 9 /L (25% vs. 37%, p=0.02). Deletion 17p +/\u2212 other abnormalities and 6q del +/\u2212 other abnormalities were each associated with shorter survival compared with other genomic aberrations or normal karyotype (p 11 g/dL (p 11 g/dL (p=0.018). Conclusions: Patients with CLL/SLL and ALC < 5 \u00d7 10 9 /L had lower rates of genomic aberrations by cytogenetic and/or FISH analysis (p=0.02), possibly because of less bone marrow infiltration in the lower-ALC group. Deletion 17p or 6q, with or without other genomic aberrations was the strongest independent adverse prognostic factor for survival in CLL/SLL.
