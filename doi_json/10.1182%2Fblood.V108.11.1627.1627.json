    "abstract_text": "It is known that liver cirrhosis is associated with hyperfibrinolysis, which might contribute to bleeding problems of patients with this disease. However, hyperfibrinolysis has been assessed by using tests (such as euglobulin, plasma or diluted whole blood clot lysis assays), which do not reflect all changes that might occur in the fibrinolytic parameters in blood. A recent study even questioned the presence of a hyperfibrinolytic state in nonbleeding cirrhotic patients, since no evidence of increased fibrinolysis was observed with a new plasma-based clot lysis assay ( Gastroenterology  2001 ; 121 : 131 ). Therefore we decided to re-investigate the fibrinolytic state of cirrhotic patients with a recently developed test for global fibrinolytic capacity (GFC) using undiluted whole blood. Non-anticoagulated blood was collected from 30 healthy controls and 75 patients with cirrhosis of varying severity (34 Child-Pugh A, 28 Child-Pugh B and 13 Child-Pugh C). The GFC was determined immediately after collection by clotting the blood, incubating the clots during 3 hours at 37 degrees and then measuring the generated fibrin degradation products. Various haemostatic parameters were determined in plasma samples by using functional activity assays. The median GFC (25 th \u201375 th percentile) increased from 1.7 (0.8\u20133.5) mg/l in the controls to 4.0 (1.6\u201313.0) mg/l in Child-Pugh A (n.s.), to 11.1 (2.3\u201331.9) mg/l in Child-Pugh B (P<0.001) and to 22.5 (3.1\u201389.6) mg/l in Child-Pugh C (P<0.01). Plasma samples of the cirrhotic patients showed significantly decreased levels of antithrombin, plasminogen, alpha-2-antiplasmin and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), significantly increased levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and no significant change in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Spearman correlation tests in the whole group (controls plus patients) showed significant correlations between GFC and antithrombin (r=\u22120.44), plasminogen (r=\u22120.38), alpha-2-antiplasmin (r=\u22120.45), TAFI (r=\u22120.40), tPA (r=0.77) and PAI-1 (r=\u22120.51) (all p-values <0.0001). In conclusion, the new GFC test, which includes all components present in blood, indicates that the fibrinolytic capacity is strongly increased in patients with severe cirrhosis. The anti-fibrinolytic effects of decreased plasminogen levels in cirrhosis are apparently overruled by the pro-fibrinolytic effects of decreased alpha-2-antiplasmin and TAFI levels and particularly of increased tPA activity levels.",
