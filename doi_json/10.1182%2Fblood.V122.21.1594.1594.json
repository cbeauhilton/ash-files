    "abstract_text": "Background Deferasirox is an oral iron chelator widely employed in the treatment of iron overload during thalassemic syndromes and myelodysplastic syndromes. Aim At present, very few data are available on the efficacy and safety of a treatment with deferasirox in patients with Ph- Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN) and transfusional requirement. Methods To address this issue, we report here on 23 patients (M/F 17/6) with MPN and iron overload secondary to transfusional requirement enrolled in the database of our regional cooperative group who received a treatment with deferasirox. Of them, 20 had a primary Myelofibrosis, 2 a post Essential Thrombocythemia myelofibrotic phase and 1 a post Polycythemia Vera myelofibrotic phase. Results The main features of the patients at diagnosis and at baseline of deferasirox treatment are reported in the Table:   . DIAGNOSIS . BASELINE . Median age, years (Interquartile Range - IR) 69.8 (63.7 \u2013 74.9) 71.0 (67.1 \u2013 75.8) Median Hb, g/dl (IR) 8.3 (7.4 \u2013 9.5) 7.6 (7.1 \u2013 8.2) Median ferritin, ng/ml (IR) 439 (171 \u2013 890) 1,404 (1,175 \u2013 1,790) Median creatinine level, mg/ml (IR) NR 1.0 (0.8 \u2013 1.1) . DIAGNOSIS . BASELINE . Median age, years (Interquartile Range - IR) 69.8 (63.7 \u2013 74.9) 71.0 (67.1 \u2013 75.8) Median Hb, g/dl (IR) 8.3 (7.4 \u2013 9.5) 7.6 (7.1 \u2013 8.2) Median ferritin, ng/ml (IR) 439 (171 \u2013 890) 1,404 (1,175 \u2013 1,790) Median creatinine level, mg/ml (IR) NR 1.0 (0.8 \u2013 1.1) View Large Treatment with deferasirox was started after a median interval from diagnosis of 9.8 months (IR 6.7 \u2013 21.7) and from transfusion requirement of 7.3 months (IR 5.7 \u2013 15.3). Starting deferasirox dose was 1,500 mg/day in 11 patients, 1,250 mg/day in 4 patients, 1,000 mg/day in 7 patients and  1.5 g/dl, with disappearance of transfusional requirement in 3 cases. Conclusions Treatment with deferasirox is feasible and effective in MPN with iron overload. Moreover, also in this setting an hematological improvement can occur in a sizeable rate of patients.
