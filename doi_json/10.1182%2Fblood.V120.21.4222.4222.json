Clinical trials for lymphoid malignancies to date have primarily targeted either the CD19 or CD20 antigens. While CD20 has a more established track record as an immunotherapy target, one potential drawback of targeting CD20 with CAR + T cells is the theoretical possibility that residual levels of circulating anti-CD20 antibodies (Ab) from prior chemoimmunotherapy regimens could partially or completely block CAR-antigen interactions. This could negatively impact the efficacy of CD20-targeted CAR + T cells. However, previous data from our group and others indicate that CD20 CAR + T cell function is only partially blocked by anti-CD20 Ab, and T cell function in the setting of anti-CD3 \u00d7 anti-CD20 bispecific Ab is not blocked by rituximab (R) levels of up to 100 \u03bcg/ml. Collectively, these data suggest that a very low number of available CD20 binding sites may be sufficient to trigger CAR signaling and T cell activation. METHODS: We tested the effect of different levels of R on in vitro function of polyclonal T cells from healthy donors negatively selected by MACS, activated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads, and transduced with epHIV7 lentiviral vectors encoding 1 st or 3 rd generation (\u03b1CD20-\u03b6 or \u03b1CD20-CD28\u201341BB-\u03b6) anti-CD20 CARs. T cells were re-stimulated 1 week after initial activation by co-culture with antigen presenting cells (APCs) that had been pre-incubated for 30 minutes with varying concentrations of R (ranging from 0 to 800 \u03bcg/ml). APCs were K562 cells transduced to express CD80 with or without CD20 (denoted \u201cK80\u201d and \u201cK80-20\u201d), or Ramos lymphoma cells. Proliferation, cytokine secretion, and cytotoxicity were then assessed as discussed below. RESULTS: We first used flow cytometry to test whether varying concentrations of R blocked binding of the Leu16 Ab and, as expected, found a dose-dependent blockade of CD20 on each cell line, with 50 \u03bcg/ml and 200 \u03bcg/ml causing near-complete blockade of K80-20 and Ramos cells, respectively. However, despite this apparent blockade, proliferation was largely unimpaired in CFSE-labeled 1 st or 3 rd generation CAR + T cells cultured with K80-20 or Ramos cells pre-incubated with R concentrations of up to 400 \u03bcg/ml. We concurrently measured cytokine secretion of these T cells using Luminex assays and found that IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 secretion decreased with increasing R levels, but 50\u201385% of baseline levels were still achieved at R concentrations of up to 100 \u03bcg/ml. Cytotoxicity against K80-20 and Ramos target cells in standard 51 Cr-release assays by 1 st and 3 rd generation CAR + T cells was largely preserved at low R concentrations, and 50\u201375% of cytolytic activity was retained at 100 \u03bcg/ml. Nonspecific proliferation, cytokine secretion, and cytotoxicity were excluded in these experiments by using CAR + T cells incubated with K80 cells lacking CD20 expression, or T cells transduced with an empty vector as negative controls. Mouse xenograft experiments are currently ongoing to test the effect of serum R levels on the in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of CD20-CAR T cells. CONCLUSIONS: These in vitro results suggest that despite apparent blockade of the CD20 antigen, CAR + T cells targeting CD20 retain significant activity in the presence of R concentrations of up to 100 ug/ml. Patients receiving 2\u20133 cycles of R-chemotherapy have serum R trough levels in the range of 30\u201370 \u03bcg/ml. We therefore predict that residual serum R levels will not present a significant impediment to CD20-targeted adoptive T cell therapy given after salvage R-chemotherapy.
