    "abstract_text": "Platelet specific integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 plays an essential role in hemostasis and thrombosis. It has been used as a prototype for understanding integrin activation and conformational regulation. Crystal structures of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 headpiece composed of the \u03b1IIb \u03b2-propeller and \u03b23 \u03b2I, hybrid, and PSI domains in the absence or presence of RGD-mimetic drugs revealed the headpiece changing from a closed to an open conformation upon ligand binding. A striking change is the swing-out motion of the \u03b23 hybrid domain away from the \u03b2I and the \u03b1IIb thigh domains. This is accompanied by the changing of the \u03b11/\u03b11'-helix from a bent to a merged and straightened \u03b1-helical conformation. The \u03b11/\u03b11'-helix is bent at the \u03b11/\u03b11' junction (\u03b23 Ile-131 to Gly-135) as revealed by the crystal structures of \u03b23, \u03b21, \u03b22, and \u03b27 integrins in the closed headpiece conformation. The \u03b23 Gly-135 at the \u03b11/\u03b11' junction is completely conserved among all the \u03b2 integrins. We propose that the conserved glycine at the \u03b11/\u03b11' junction is critical for maintaining the bent \u03b11/\u03b11'-helix conformation, and the \u03b11/\u03b11'-helix unbending is required for integrin activation and bidirectional signaling. To test this hypothesis, we mutated the \u03b23 Gly-135 to alanine and showed that the \u03b23-G135A mutation rendered \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin constitutively binding the activation-dependent mAb PAC-1. In contrast, the \u03b23-G135P mutation had minor effect on integrin activation. This is consistent with the idea that alanine tends to stabilize a straight \u03b1-helical structure, while glycine and proline tend to introduce a bend or kink into the \u03b1-helical conformation when present at the internal positions of an \u03b1-helix. That is, the conserved \u03b23 Gly-135 is essential for restraining the \u03b11/\u03b11'-helix in the bent conformation. The \u03b23 Gly-135 is partially exposed in the bent conformation of \u03b11/\u03b11'-helix and buried deeply into the hydrophobic environment upon the \u03b11/\u03b11'-helix unbending. We rationalized that the hydrophilic substitutions will restrain, while the hydrophobic substitutions will facilitate the burying of \u03b23 Gly-135, and thus block and induce \u03b11/\u03b11'-helix unbending, respectively. As expected, the \u03b23-G135R and G135K mutations completely blocked PAC-1 binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin stimulated by Mn 2+ or by the \u03b1IIb-R995D mutation that mimics integrin inside-out activation. In sharp contrast, the \u03b23-G135L and G135M mutations constitutively induced PAC-1 binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin. To further confirm the \u03b11/\u03b11'-helix unbending is required for integrin activation and signaling, we introduced tandem double or triple glycine substitutions into the \u03b11/\u03b11' junction to reinforce the bent conformation of \u03b11/\u03b11'-helix. Remarkably, all the double or triple glycine mutations completely abolished soluble PAC-1 binding stimulated by Mn 2+ from outside or by the \u03b1IIb-R995D or \u03b1IIb-F993A mutation from inside the cell. This data provide compelling evidence that the integrin \u03b11/\u03b11'-helix unbending is indispensible for high affinity ligand binding. Interestingly, the \u03b23-G135R or double glycine mutant still mediated cell adhesion to immobilized PAC-1 or fibrinogen, but at a reduced level. The cell adhesion could be blocked by eptifibatide, indicating the binding ability of the mutant integrins with the high affinity small molecule ligand. However, eptifibatide failed to induce the ectodomain extension of the mutant integrins. In addition, integrin-mediated outside-in signaling, such as cell spreading, focal adhesion and F-actin stress fiber formation, and focal adhesion kinase activation was inhibited by the \u03b23-G135R or double glycine mutations. This data demonstrated that the conformational communication initiated by ligand binding is interrupted due to the defect of \u03b11/\u03b11'-helix unbending. We further showed that overexpression of talin1 head domain failed to induce PAC-1 binding to the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin with double glycine mutations at the \u03b11/\u03b11' junction, but still induced integrin ectodomain extension. That is, in the inside-out integrin activation, the ectodomain extension alone does not result in high affinity ligand binding. The conformational signal has to be relayed to the ligand binding site through \u03b11/\u03b11'-helix unbending. In conclusion, our data established the structural role of the \u03b11/\u03b11' junction that allows relaxation of the \u03b11/\u03b11'-helix in the resting state and transmission of bidirectional conformational signals by helix unbending upon integrin activation.
