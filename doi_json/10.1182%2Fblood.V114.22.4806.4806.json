    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4806 Introduction Pixantrone (PIX), an aza-anthracenedione, which has successfully completed a phase 3 trial (J Clin Oncol 2009; 27:15s, No. 8523) was designed to enhance clinical efficacy while significantly decreasing cardiotoxicity compared to doxorubicin (DOX) and mitoxantrone (MIT). Multidose administration, in animal models of equitoxic doses of PIX, MIT, and DOX, with or without prior therapy with DOX, resulted in minimal evidence for PIX cardiotoxicity compared with the severe histologic lesions seen with these other agents (Cavaletti et al: Investigational New Drugs 2007; 3:187-95). Both DOX and MIT contain a dihydroquinone structural element known to interact with iron. Additionally, DOX contains an aliphatic ketone which, once metabolized to the corresponding secondary alcohol metabolite doxorubicinol, is implicated in release of free iron and the chronic cardiotoxicity observed with DOX. In contrast, PIX has a nitrogen containing heterocycle which replaces the dihydroquinone, forming an aza-anthracenedione structure. PIX also does not contain an aliphatic ketone and cannot form metabolites analogous to doxorubicinol. Methods To validate the proposed mechanisms underlying the observed differences in cardiotoxicity, we used established spectrophotometric techniques to quantify iron:drug interactions that are thought to be mechanistic for chronic doxorubicin cardiotoxicity (Menna et al: Cardiovasc Toxicol 2007; 7:80\u201385). Results Adding increasing amounts of iron to drug solution, we observed that DOX and MIT underwent changes in visible range absorbance patterns, characteristic of drug:iron complex formation, confirming the expected 1:3 Fe(II)-drug ratio for both DOX and MIT. In contrast, no spectrophotometric changes were observed with iron added to PIX, clearly demonstrating that PIX does not bind iron. In vitro studies using H2C9 rat myocardial cells indicate that PIX (ID 50 >50 \u03bcg/ml) is far less toxic than DOX (ID 50 = 1 \u03bc/ml). Moreover, PIX does not induce significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the H2C9 cells compared to DOX. Conclusion These results demonstrate that PIX does not bind iron and that its inability to bind iron and its reduced propensity to generate ROS may be the mechanism for reduced PIX cardiotoxicity in animal models compared to DOX or MIT.
