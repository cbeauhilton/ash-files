    "abstract_text": "Introduction Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have single agent activity in various types of lymphoma. They restore antigen-specific immune recognition in B-cell lymphoma cells and modulate programmed cell death (PD)-1 expression on circulating T-lymphocytes. Pembrolizumab (PEM) is highly active in Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) and demonstrates a 12-month PFS of 46% in patients with R/R HL. Preclinical studies have shown synergism of this combination in mouse models of various tumors. We present the interim efficacy analysis from the first stage of our phase II trial investigating the combination of the HDAC inhibitor Entinostat (ENT) and the PD-1-blocking antibody PEM in patients with R/R HL. Methods Patients with R/R HL received ENT 5-7 mg orally once weekly and PEM 200 mg intravenously once every three weeks. Prior use of anti-PD-1 or HDAC inhibitor was allowed if there had been clinical benefit. Tumor assessment was evaluated using the RECIL criteria. The primary endpoint is the 12-month progression-free survival (PFS). Using a Simon two-stage minimax design to power the study, 21 patients were to be enrolled in the first stage with a 12-month PFS rate of 40% considered undesirable and 60% desirable. Results At time of data censoring on 7/24/21, 22 patients with HL have been enrolled. The median number of prior therapies was 5 (2-17). 7 (32%) were refractory to the most recent therapy, 13 (59%) had received autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), 12 (55%) prior anti-PD1 antibody therapy, and 3 (14%) prior HDAC inhibitor therapy. Out of 22 evaluable patients, the overall response rate (ORR) was 86% and the complete response (CR) rate was 45%. Responding patients included 9 with prior anti-PD-1 antibody and 3 with prior HDAC inhibitor therapy. With median duration of follow-up among survivors of 8.4 months (2-26), the 12-month PFS was 72% (44%-87%). Reasons for treatment discontinuation included: progression (n=6), toxicities (n=5) consolidation with transplant or radiation (n=3), withdrawal of consent (n=3), and completion of study protocol (n=2). Severe toxicities resulting in study discontinuation were pleural effusions, pericarditis, pneumonitis and peripheral neuropathy. Out of the 22 total patients with HL enrolled in this study, 50% of patients had grade \u22653 (41%) and thrombocytopenia (32%). 41% exhibited grade \u22653 non-hematologic AEs, which included pericardial or pleural effusions (n=2, 9%), as well as fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, pneumonitis, elevated lipase, hyperglycemia, and peripheral neuropathy. AEs that were potentially immune-related included hypothyroidism (n=2, 9%), elevated transaminases (n=4, 18%), diarrhea (n=3, 14%) and pneumonitis (n=2, 8%). Conclusions Interim results following stage I of this phase 2 trial demonstrates a 12-month PFS rate of 74%, meeting the primary endpoint of the study and justifying continued investigation of the combination of PEM and ENT. In this heavily pretreated patient population, responses were seen in the majority of patients despite prior exposure to anti-PD-1 agents.
