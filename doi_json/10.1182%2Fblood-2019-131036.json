    "abstract_text": "Mutations in DNA methyltransferase type 3A ( DNMT3A ) are frequently associated with myeloid malignancies including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) including systemic mastocytosis (SM). Presence of this mutation is associated with poor prognosis and reduced overall patient survival. Earlier studies have shown that hematopoietic specific loss of Dnmt3a in mice results in lethal, fully penetrant MPN with myelodysplasia (MDS/MPN) characterized by extramedullary hematopoiesis, peripheral cytopenias, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. However, it's unclear how DNMT3A mutations contribute to myeloid skewing, and induce myeloid malignancies. Further, the mechanism(s) by which loss of DNMT3A impairs various mast cell functions leading to mastocytosis are also not defined. We show that loss of Dnmt3a in vitro results in accelerated and enhanced differentiation of mast cells from its bone marrow (BM) precursors and in vivo results in increased number of mast cells. Genome wide transcriptome analysis revealed elevated expression of the transcription factor MITF and a profound repression in the expression of C/EBP\u03b1 in BM precursors derived from Dnmt3a -/- mice. Importantly, restoring the expression of Dnmt3a in Dnmt3a deficient BM cells, completely restored enhanced differentiation, along with correction in levels of MITF and C/EBP\u03b1 , suggesting that early loss of C/EBP\u03b1 in Dnmt3a -/- cells contributes to enhanced maturation of mast cells from its precursors. Furthermore, biochemical analysis revealed greater PI3Kinase activation in Dnmt3a -/- cells, and these findings were supported by genome wide transcriptome analysis. Importantly, mast cells derived from Dnmt3a -/- mice lacking the expression of p85\u03b1 regulatory subunit of PI3Kinase or pharmacologic inhibition of PI3Kinase completely corrected cytokine induced hyperproliferation in these cells to near normal levels. Insights from mast cell studies led us to hypothesize that the aberrant hematopoietic regulation in Dnmt3a -/- mice described above may be due to hyperactivation of the PI3Kinase signaling in hematopoietic stem and progenitors (HSCPs). We investigated the role of PI3Kinase signaling in Dnmt3a loss induced myeloid malignancy using pharmacological inhibitor, GDC0941 (PI3K\u03b1/\u03b4 inhibitor) and BAY1082439 (PI3K\u03b1/\u03b2 inhibitor). PI3K\u03b1/\u03b2 inhibitor treatment of Dnmt3a -/- mice markedly reduced monocytosis, neutrophilia, enhanced WBC counts, and improved RBCs, hematocrits and platelet numbers compared to control mice. In contrast, PI3K\u03b1/\u03b4 inhibition moderately corrected the monocytosis and WBC aberrancy, however correction in erythroid dysregulation was not observed. Inhibiting PI3K\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling dramatically reduced splenomegaly and hepatomegaly in Dnmt3a -/- mice. In contrast, PI3K\u03b1/\u03b4 inhibition moderately reduced the spleen size, however the correction in hepatomegaly was insignificant. Importantly, clonal hematopoiesis due to loss of Dnmt3a in a competitive transplant setting was rescued by inhibiting the PI3Kinase pathway. In the BM, PI3K\u03b1/\u03b2 inhibition moderately decreased LSK cells, however a marked decrease in GMP, and significant increase in MEP, and CLP was observed compared to controls. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that PI3K\u03b1/\u03b2 inhibition reduced Dnmt3a -/- BM cell migration to liver, and completely corrected the extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen compared to controls. Further, Dnmt3a loss induced alteration in erythroid development in the BM, spleen and PB was corrected upon PI3K\u03b1/\u03b2 blockade compared to controls. Genome wide transcriptome analysis revealed that PI3K\u03b1/\u03b2 inhibition markedly reduced the expression of GMP related genes, fetal liver hematopoiesis transcription program, and expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and chemokines in Dnmt3a depleted malignant mice. However PI3K\u03b1/\u03b2 inhibition increased the expression of genes involved in erythroid development in Dnmt3a -/- mice compared to controls. These results demonstrate that Dnmt3a ablation induces liver specific expansion of hematopoietic cells, and extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen via aberrant activation of PI3Kinase signaling in HSCPs. Consistent with this notion, PI3K inhibitor treatment of malignant Dnmt3a -/- bearing mice showed significantly improved overall survival compared to controls.
