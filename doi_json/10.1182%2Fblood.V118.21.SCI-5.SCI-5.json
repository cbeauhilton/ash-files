    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-5 CD4+ T cells, upon activation, differentiate into cytokine-producing effector helper T (TH) cells. In addition to TH1 and TH2 lineage cells, additional TH subsets, including TH17 and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells have been identified. TH17 cells produce IL-17, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-22 and mediate tissue inflammation. TH17 cells play protective or pathogenic roles in cancer, depending on the context. On the other hand, Tfh cells produce IL-21 and regulate germinal center reactions. Tfh cells may play a role in some forms of lymphoma. I will discuss on the regulation and function of these two subsets of T cells in the context of cancer.
