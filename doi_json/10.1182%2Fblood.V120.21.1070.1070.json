    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1070 Under conditions of pathological shear rate, von Willebrand Factor (vWF) undergoes conformational changes and self aggregation. We sought to visualize this phenomenon using a novel microfluidic model of stenosis and understand its role in thrombus formation in elevated shear rate environments. In severe stenosis, vWF experiences millisecond exposures to pathological wall shear rates (g w ). Distinct from shear experiments that last many seconds, we deployed microfluidic devices for single-pass perfusion of whole blood or platelet free plasma (PFP) over fibrillar type 1 collagen (< 50 msec transit time) at pathological g w or spatial wall shear rate gradient ( grad g w ). Using fluorescent anti-vWF, long thick vWF fibers (>20 mm) bound to collagen were visualized at constant g w > 30,000 s \u22121 during perfusion of PFP, a process enhanced by EDTA. Rapid acceleration or deceleration of EDTA-PFP at grad g w = \u00b1 5.5 \u00d7 10 5 to 4.3 \u00d7 10 7 s \u22121 /cm did not promote vWF deposition when g w < 30,000. At 19,400 s \u22121 , EDTA-blood perfusion resulted in rolling vWF-platelet nets, while blood perfusion (normal Ca 2+ ) generated large vWF/platelet deposits that repeatedly embolized and were blocked by anti-GP1b or the a IIb \u03b2 3 inhibitor GR144053 and did not require shear gradients. Blood perfusion at venous shear rate (200 s \u22121 ) produced a stable platelet deposit that was a substrate for massive but unstable vWF-platelet aggregates when flow was increased to 7800 s \u22121 . Supported by collagen and enhanced by platelet GP1b and a IIb \u03b2 3 , vWF fiber formation occurred during acute exposures to pathological g w but did not require wall shear rate gradients. Figure 1 View large Download slide A, Platelet free citrated-plasma was treated with 1 \u03bcg/mL fluorescently labeled anti-vWF and 5 mM EDTA. The plasma samples were perfused over a collagen type 1 surface at local wall shear rates of 30,000, 62,400 and 125,000 s \u22121 from left to right. Long fibers of vWF (>20 \u03bcm) appeared at shear rates above \u223c30,000 s \u22121 , with more fibers appearing at higher shear rates. The bar indicates 15 \u03bcm.
