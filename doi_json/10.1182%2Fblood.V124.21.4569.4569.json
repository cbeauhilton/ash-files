    "abstract_text": "Myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) are heterogeneous clonal diseases with variable clinical courses. Mutations in the Cbl family genes have been reported in multiple independent studies to be present in about 10% of patients with MPDs and these patients tend of have a poorer prognosis. We have previously demonstrated that Cbl-flox/flox, Cbl-b-null mice rendered Cbl/Cbl-b double knockout (DKO) in the hematopoietic compartment with MMTV-Cre develop a disease phenotypically similar to human MPDs. An in vitro kinase inhibitor screen identified fasudil, a ROCK inhibitor, with relatively selective anti-proliferative activity against Cbl/Cbl-b DKO vs. control murine bone marrow cells. We established a mouse model with a uniform time of MPD onset by transplanting Cbl/Cbl-b DKO bone marrow cells (2x10 6 per recipient) into 21 busulfan-conditioned NOD/SCID/gamma chain-deficient (NSG) mice. All recipients showed donor cell engraftment. Four weeks post-transplant, we treated 13 mice with 100 mg/kg fasudil daily by gavage. By two weeks of treatment, total white cell and monocyte counts were significantly lower in mice treated with fasudil (p=0.02 and 0.04 respectively). For the entire group, we observed a trend towards improved survival in fasudil-treated mice that didn't reach statistical significance (p=0.07). However, analysis of male recipients only (n=12) revealed a significant survival advantage in fasudil-treated group (p=0.04). The gender difference may stem from a currently unexplained more severe disease phenotype we observed in female recipients. Notably, while all untreated mice succumbed to MPD, prolonged survival was observed in 2 mice beyond 27 weeks, nearly twice the average life-span in the Cbl/Cbl-b DKO MPD model (16 weeks). The 2 long-term survivors had undetectable levels of myosin light chain (MLC), a downstream target of ROCK phosphorylation (figure) suggesting that inhibition of downstream signaling of ROCK is associated with improved disease control and survival. Taken together, our data suggest a therapeutic potential for fasudil in the treatment of MPDs or other mutant Cbl-driven myeloid disorders.
