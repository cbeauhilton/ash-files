    "abstract_text": "During development, the hematopoietic stem cells that go on to populate the bone marrow and give rise to all blood cell lineages emerge from a specialized endothelial subpopulation. We have previously harnessed this vestigial identity to achieve the direct conversion of adult endothelial cells (ECs) into long-term engraftable hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (rEC-HSPCs); however, to date, we had only detected and characterized functional T cells that result from the transplantation, engraftment, and differentiation of mouse rEC-HSPCs (Lis, R. et al., Conversion of adult endothelium to immunocompetent haematopoietic stem cells. Nature, 545:439-445. 2017). We first reprogrammed adult human endothelium using lentiviral vectors encoding FOSB , GFI1 , SPI1 , and RUNX1 ( FGRS ) under constitutive promoters and an inductive vascular niche (Sandler V. et al., Reprogramming of human endothelium into hematopoietic cells requires vascular niche induction. Nature, 511:312-8. 2014). The resulting rEC-HSPCs maintained exogenous expression of the four transcription factors for over 20 weeks post-transplantation into immuno-compromised NSG mice. Constitutive expression of Spi1 , however, has been shown to hinder lymphoid differentiation in vivo by blocking T lymphopoiesis (Anderson, M. et al. Constitutive expression of PU.1 in fetal hematopoietic progenitors blocks T cell development at the pro-T cell stage. Immunity 16:285-296. 2002). In addition, mice of the NSG strain cannot educate native B or T cells to maturity. Our system of constitutive exogenous FGRS expression was therefore unable to confer transplanted immuno-compromised mice the ability to generate an adaptive immune response. Here, we obtained human rEC-HSPCs making use of (i) doxycycline-inducible vectors to temporarily overexpress FGRS and (ii) transgenic substrains of NSG mice (one carrying human stem cell factor, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin 3; the other, human major histocompatibility complex class I as well as beta-2 microglobulin) for transplantation assays. We show that human rEC-HSPCs engraft primary- and secondary-transplanted mice for over a year at levels of up to 20% in the spleen or bone marrow. Engrafted cells differentiate into all blood lineages including phenotypically and functionally mature T cells in the absence of exogenous FGRS expression in vivo . Notably, the resulting T cells undergo TCR rearrangement and are able to clear viral particles one week post-LCMV infection. Functional and phenotypic analyses are presented in juxtaposition with experiments using cord blood-transplanted mice. These results demonstrate that our present direct conversion strategy generates bona fide human hematopoietic stem cells from adult endothelial cells.
