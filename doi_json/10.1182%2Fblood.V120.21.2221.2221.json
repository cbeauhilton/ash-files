    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2221 Increased thrombin generation and hypercoagulability are prominent features of inflammatory colitis and previous studies from our laboratory have suggested that thrombin-mediated proteolysis is a driver of both colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC). However, the downstream thrombin targets important in these disease processes have not been fully defined. Based on studies showing that the protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) can contribute to both inflammatory pathologies and cancer progression in other settings, we hypothesized that PAR-1 is a significant determinant of colitis and CAC. To test this hypothesis, we induced colitis in PAR-1\u2212/\u2212 and control mice using intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). Consistent with the concept that PAR-1 is a modifier of colitis pathobiology, PAR-1\u2212/\u2212 mice lost significantly less weight than WT mice challenged in parallel. Furthermore, multiple inflammatory cytokines known to drive colitis pathology, including IL-6, TNFa, and MIP-1\u03b1, were significantly diminished in PAR-1\u2212/\u2212 mice. However, histological analyses of colonic tissue revealed similar degrees of inflammatory cell infiltration, crypt abscesses, and mucosal hyperplasia in both genotypes. In order to explore the role of PAR-1 in the more complex process of inflammation-driven colon cancer pathogenesis, we induced CAC in PAR-1\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice using a two step protocol consisting of azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) exposure. In contrast to findings in the setting of TNBS challenge, PAR-1\u2212/\u2212 mice challenged with DSS developed, not less, but more severe clinical signs of colitis, including wasting and severe diarrhea. More detailed comparative studies of DSS-challenged PAR-1\u2212/\u2212 and control mice established that PAR-1-deficient animals developed significantly greater immunological and histopathological evidence of colitis, including elevated IL-6 and MIP-1\u03b1 levels in colonic tissue and increased edema, ulceration, crypt loss, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Consistent with the more severe antecedent colitis, PAR-1\u2212/\u2212 mice challenged with AOM/DSS developed significantly larger adenomas than WT mice challenged and evaluated in parallel. Thus, the impact of PAR-1 on colitis appears to be context-dependent and the distinct outcomes in TNBS- and DSS-challenged mice are likely to stem from the different mechanisms by which these agents induce colitis. TNBS is thought to haptenate colonic mucosal proteins inducing a T cell-mediated colitis akin to human Crohn's disease. In contrast, DSS directly intoxicates colonic crypt epithelia, resulting in loss of barrier function and translocation of colonic microflora, leading to a primarily innate immune-driven colitis sharing many features with ulcerative colitis. A major challenge in dissecting the precise mechanisms coupling PAR-1 to colitis is the fact that PAR-1 is expressed on multiple cell types that can influence colitis and CAC in distinct ways, including immune cells, endothelial cells and colonic mucosa. Therefore, we recently generated mice carrying a conditional \u201cfloxed\u201d PAR-1 allele. We interbred these animals with mice expressing Cre recombinase in either colonic epithelia or the hematopoietic/endothelial compartment. Preliminary studies revealed that loss of PAR-1 expression in the hematopoietic/endothelial compartments, but not the colonic epithelia, recapitulates the more severe DSS-induced weight loss and mucosal damage observed in constitutionally PAR-1-deficient mice. These results suggest that PAR-1 activation in either immune cells and/or endothelial cells limits colitis severity in this experimental context. Taken together, these data show that PAR-1 contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory colitis and CAC, but the precise contribution is dependent on the underlying insult and disease pathway. Analyses in mice carrying a conditional PAR-1 allele should prove invaluable for dissecting the precise mechanisms coupling PAR-1 to inflammatory bowel disease.
