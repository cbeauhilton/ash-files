    "abstract_text": "Abstract 806 Interferon alpha (IFN\u03b1) is an effective treatment for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). In addition to inducing hematological responses in most MPN patients, IFN\u03b1 reduces the JAK2V617F allelic burden and can render the JAK2V617F mutant clone undetectable in some patients. The mechanism underlying these responses is incompletely understood and whether the molecular responses that are seen occur due to the effects of IFN\u03b1 on JAK2V617F mutant stem cells is debated. Using a murine model of Jak2V617F MPN, we investigated the effects of IFN\u03b1 on Jak2V617F MPN stem cells in vivo. Chimeric transplant recipients were generated with purified stem cell enriched populations (lin \u2212 Kit + Sca1 + ) and these were treated for 4 weeks with either IFN\u03b1 or vehicle control. IFN\u03b1 treatment caused a reduction in extramedullary hematopoiesis (spleen weight, vehicle 262mg vs IFN\u03b1 192mg, p<0.01), hematocrit (vehicle 76.0% vs IFN\u03b1 65.5%, p<0.05) and white blood cell count (vehicle 13.9\u00d710 9 /L vs IFN\u03b1 7.5\u00d710 9 /L, p<0.01) in this disease model. IFN\u03b1 treatment caused a reduction in early (CD71+Ter119+) erythroid progenitors that had accumulated in the spleen of Jak2V617F mice. IFN\u03b1 treatment caused selective depletion of Jak2V617F MPN hematopoietic stem cells (HSC, lin \u2212 kit + Sca1 + CD150 + CD48 \u2212 ) over time and this was associated with reduced Jak2V617F chimerism in the long-term HSC compartment (Jak2V617F chimerism Vehicle 41.4% vs. IFN\u03b1 23.9%, p<0.05). IFN\u03b1 treatment impaired the transmission of Jak2V617F-MPN and reduced Jak2V617F chimerism in transplanted recipient mice, demonstrating functional depletion of disease-specific stem cells. Mechanistically, IFN\u03b1 treatment preferentially induced cell-cycle activation of Jak2V617F mutant long-term HSCs. Gene expression profiling revealed relative enrichment of cell cycle genes and depletion of quiescence related genes in IFN\u03b1 treated Jak2V617F HSC compared to IFN\u03b1 treated WT HSC. IFN\u03b1 treatment promoted a predetermined terminal erythroid-lineage differentiation program within myeloid progenitor cells. The effects on Jak2V617F long-term HSC were absent in Jak2V617F +/\u2212 IFNAR1 \u2212/\u2212 (lacking the type 1 interferon receptor) chimeric mice demonstrating that the effects of IFN\u03b1 treatment were cell autonomous and specific for type 1 interferon signalling. These findings provide insights into the differential effects of IFN\u03b1 on Jak2V617F mutant and normal hematopoiesis and suggest that IFN\u03b1 achieves molecular remissions in MPN patients through its effects on MPN stem cells. Furthermore, these results support combinatorial therapeutic approaches in MPN, by concurrently depleting dormant JAK2V617F MPN-propagating stem cells with IFN\u03b1 and targeting the proliferating downstream progeny with JAK2-inhibitors or cytotoxic chemotherapy.
