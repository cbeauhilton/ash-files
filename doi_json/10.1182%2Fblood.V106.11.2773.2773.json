    "abstract_text": "Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are a frequent cause of morbidity and death in pts with AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS). Because early diagnosis of IFI is difficult, antifungal prophylaxis (AFP) including mold-active agents has become an important strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality in this patient population and is routinely used at MDACC for AML and HR-MDS pts undergoing RIC. We retrospectively compared the efficacy and safety of 6 AFP regimens (Sept 97- July 04) among 659 evaluable pts with newly diagnosed AML and HR-MDS who received RIC and had been enrolled in our prospective AFP trials. See regimens listed in Table below. There were no significant differences among the 6 regimens with regard to key baseline characteristics (age, gender, diagnosis, cytogenetics, type of RIC, Zubrod PS, WBC count, non-fungal infection and protected environment) and median days of AFP. 37 pts (5.6%) developed IFI (yeast 3 %; mold 2.6%). No mold infections were observed among pts randomized to AMBI or VORI. With the exception of VORI, which was significantly more effective than IV ITRA (p =0.03), all comparisons of efficacy among the AFP regimens were not significant. Drug discontinuation was the highest with IV VORI (21%) and ABLC (18%). VORI was more toxic than IV ITRA, Caspo, and F+I (p=0.023, 0.001 and 0.031 respectively). VORI toxicity was reversible and consisted of visual and/or auditory hallucinations and elevation in serum bilirubin. There was a trend toward developing VORI toxicity if baseline bilirubin levels were elevated (OR=4.9; p=0.10). We conclude that the rate of IFI in AML and HR-MDS pts undergoing RIC given mold-active AFP is 5.6 %. VORI and AMBI effectively prevented mold infections. VORI was more effective that IV ITRA but was associated with a high rate of reversible drug-related adverse events.  . ABLC (n=131) . AMBI (n=69) . F+I (n=67) . IV ITRA (n=225) . CASPO (n=106) .
