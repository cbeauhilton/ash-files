    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Iron overload in adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) can lead to variety of complications like liver dysfunction/cirrhosis, cardiac enlargement, diabetes mellitus, hypogonadism and arthropathy. These complication can be prevented by iron chelation therapy .We did retrospective analysis to find incidence of iron over load in this population and also did a survey to find the insurance status in this population. Methods: We take care of approximately 300 adult patients with SCD at out hematology clinic. We did retrospective analysis to investigate the prevalence of iron overload in this population. We also did survey on 100 adult patients with SCD to find out about the insurance converge for them. Web search was done to find out the average monthly cost of iron chelators. Results: On retrospective analysis of 458 adult patients with SCD, we found that 117/458(25.58%) had iron over load. Majority of them, 93/117 were SS type of SCD. Results of survey done on 100 adult patients with SCD showed that 61 had Medicaid, 2 were free care, 25 had Medicare and 12 had private insurance. The average monthly cost of Deferiprone is $ 18762, while that of Deferasirox is $ 13,082. Conclusions: Iron over load is a common complication affecting a quarter of the adult patients with SCD. The treatment of iron overload is expensive, as just the iron-chelator therapy costs approximately 160 to 220 K per year. In an attempt to minimize additional iron accumulation in our chronically transfused patient population we encourage the schedule of exchange of 1 unit phlebotomy and 1 unit of red cell infusion every two weeks.
