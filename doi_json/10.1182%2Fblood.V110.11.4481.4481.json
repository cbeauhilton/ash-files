    "abstract_text": "Background: The addition of rituximab to CHOP chemotherapy (R-CHOP) has resulted in a marked improvement in outcome for patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The previously estimated risk factors needed to be re-evaluated in immunochemotherapy era. Shen et al. ( Blood  109 : 1857 \u201361, 2007 ) reported that a revised (R) international prognostic index (IPI) provided a more clinically relevant prediction of outcome than IPI. To assess the applicability of IPI and R-IPI in unselected Korean DLBCL patients, we conducted this study. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL treated with R-CHOP to assess the value of the IPI and R-IPI. Results: From January 2004 to July 2006, 113 newly diagnosed DLBCL patients from four Korean institutes were included. Patients characteristics were: median age 54 y (range: 14\u201383), male 62.8%, extranodal disease 54.9%, age greater than 60y 40.7%, ECOG PS greater than 2 10.6%, elevated LDH 46.9%, more than 1 extranodal sites 17.7%, stage III/IV 40.7%. The 3 year EFS rate was 60.2% and the 3 year OS rate was 66.7%. Estimated 3 year EFS and OS according to IPI were described in the table. Conclusions: The IPI score as well as R-IPI was an important prognostic parameter in unselected Korean DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP.  .
