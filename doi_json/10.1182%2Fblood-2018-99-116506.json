    "abstract_text": "Background. The outcome of allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is measured in terms of graft versus host disease (GvHD), non-relapse mortality (NRM) and survival. Days of Hospital stay and number of re-admissions, are important surrogates of outcome, quality of life, and also of costs, but are usually not reported. Aim of the study . Assess the number of days alive and outside the Hospital (DAOH) , together with the frequency of a new re-admission, in the first 100 days after transplant. Patients. W e analyzed 212 patients who received an allogeneic HSCT from matched sibling (SIB) (n=64), unrelated donors (UD) (n=74) and family haploidentical donors (HAPLO) (n=74). Median age was 49 years (19-71), disease phase was in remission in 53%; diagnoses was acute leukemia (66%) , MDS (14%) chronic disorders 20%. DAOH. The median DAOH for SIB, HAPLO and UD grafts was 78, 72 and 66 days (p=0.0001). The median DAOH for SIB patients was significantly longer than for UD patients (p=0.00002) and for HAPLO grafts (p=0.0008); the median DAOH for UD and HAPLO patients were comparable (p=0.4). Donor type was the strongest predictor of DAOH , followed by a Sorror score >2 (p=0.04). Re-admission. Fifty four patients, of 185 discharged, required a re-admission for complications. the first cause for readmission was fever of unknown origin (54%), followed by GvHD (18,5% ) ,cystitis (8%) , relapse (7%) and respiratory problems (7%). The only factor predicting re-admission was advanced disease (p=0.01). Patients who were re-admitted to hospital within 100 days had a significantly higher risk of non relapse mortality (NRM) (25%) as compared to patient non re-admitted (5%) irrespective of the cause for re-admission (p=0.0001). In a multivariate analysis re-admission was the strongest predictor of NRM, with a risk ratio of 10.9 (p=0.0002). Days of admission and cost. The average number of days in hospital within 100 days from transplant, was 37,6 for UD, 35,0 for HAPLO and 25,0 for SIBS (p=0.0002). The average cost of admission within 100 days from HSCT, was \u20ac69522 for UD, \u20ac64715 for HAPLO and \u20ac46225 euros for SIBS. Conclusion. HAPLO transplants with PT-CY and UD transplants , have lower numbers of DAOH, as compared to SIB grafts, which implies longer stay in hospital and greater cost. Re-admission to Hospital within 100 days is predicted by disease phase and has a very strong impact on non relapse mortality. Figure. View large Download slide Figure.
