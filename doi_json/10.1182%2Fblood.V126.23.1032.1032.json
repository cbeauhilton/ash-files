    "abstract_text": "Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) catalyzes thiol-disulfide exchange reactions that are critical for protein function. PDI has two distinct CGHC redox-active sites, but nothing is known about which site is important in physiologic reactions including thrombosis. To study the role of PDI and its active sites in thrombosis we used two genetically-modified models, Mx1-Cre/PDI fl/fl mice with blood cells and vessel wall cells lacking PDI, and transgenic PDI(ss-oo) mice with PDI lacking the second CGHC active site. Using laser-induced cremaster arteriole injury fibrin deposition was decreased in both mouse models. Both mouse models showed attenuation of platelet accumulation using laser arterial injury and FeCl 3 -induced mesenteric artery injury. The defects in fibrin deposition and platelet accumulation were rescued by infusion of recombinant PDI(oo-ss) containing only a functional second active site, confirming the second active site of PDI was critical for both fibrin formation and platelet accumulation. In vitro studies showed that platelet aggregation depended on the second CGHC motif of PDI, and that binding of PDI protein to platelets depended on the presence of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin. Studies on platelet secretion revealed that P-selectin expression and ATP release were dependent on a functional second active site of PDI. Treatment of the platelets with eptifibatide did not affect P-selectin expression. Together these findings suggest the second active of PDI catalyzes a reaction in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 supporting platelet aggregation and a reaction in a non-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 substrate supporting secretion. In vivo studies on coagulation showed that PDI infusion rescued fibrin formation in eptifibatide-treated mice in which platelet accumulation was completely blocked, suggesting that PDI directly contributes to activation of coagulation. In summary, our results indicate that the second CGHC active site of PDI has a role in platelet function and coagulation. Targeting this site may have a dual inhibitory effect on thrombosis by decreasing both platelet and fibrin accumulation. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
