    "abstract_text": "FTX-6058, a selective and potent binder of embryonic ectoderm development protein (EED), is being investigated in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). In-vitro and pre-clinical Townes mouse studies show FTX-6058 upregulates expression of the gamma globulin gene leading to increased levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF). In human clinical trials, as an early indicator of FTX-6058 induced gamma globulin expression, a reverse transcriptase droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) assay was developed and validated by Precision for Medicine. Versus RT-qPCR, RT-ddPCR gives absolute copy number, does not require a standard curve, and is more precise and reproducible for low expressed targets 1,2 . Precision for Medicine developed and validated RT-ddPCR assays for the target globin genes \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 and for the housekeeping genes TFRC and OAZ1. RNA isolated from 3 healthy and 3 SCD affected individuals was used for development and validation of the assay. The upper and lower limits of quantification were 120,000 and 10.5 copies/20\u03bcL reaction, respectively. For samples with >50 copies/20\u03bcL reaction, the CV for technical replicates was <20% for all transcripts. Furthermore, Precision for Medicine demonstrated SCD affected individuals express approximately 15-fold more \u03b3 globulin versus non affected individuals. Fulcrum utilized the globin RT-ddPCR assay validated by Precision for Medicine in the FTX-6058 phase 1 clinical trial FIS 002-2020. 1 Zhao Y, Xia Q, Yin Y, Wang Z (2016), Comparison of Droplet Digital PCR and Quantitative PCR Assays for Quantitative Detection of Xanthomonas citri Subsp. citri.
