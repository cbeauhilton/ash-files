Leung, Eric Tse, Cyrus Kumana, Yok-Lam Kwong. Departments of Medicine and Clinical Biochemistry, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong Background. Conventional maintenance therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in first complete remission (CR1) comprises all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), mercaptopurine and methotrexate. Arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3 ) is used predominantly in relapsed cases. The efficacy and safety of earlier use of As 2 O 3 in maintenance remain undefined. The availability of oral-As 2 O 3 makes As 2 O 3 maintenance practical. Materials and methods. From 2001\u20132008, 49 patients (24 men, 25 women, median age: 44 (16\u201373) years) with APL in CR1 (achieved after induction with ATRA, daunorubicin and cytosine arabinoside, and consolidated with daunorubicin and cytosine arabinoside) were studied. The following 2-year oral-As 2 O 3 maintenance regimens were used: oral- As 2 O 3 (10 mg/day \u00d7 14 Tevery 2 months, n=20), oral-As 2 O 3 + ATRA (22.5\u201345 mg/m 2 /day \u00d7 14 every 2 months, n=20), and oral-As 2 O 3 + ATRA + ascorbic acid (1 gm/day \u00d7 14, every 2 months, n=9). As 2 O 3 regimens were approved by the institutional review board at Queen Mary Hospital. All As 2 O 3 maintenance regimens were orally administered at home. Results. At diagnosis, the presenting leucocyte count was > 10 \u00d7 10 9 /L in 9 cases, and platelet count < 40 \u00d7 10 9 /L in 32 cases. At a median follow-up of 25 (2\u201387) months, there were 4 relapses (risk group: high, n=3; low, n=1; relapse site: bone marrow, n=4; central nervous system, CNS, n=2; maintenance protocol: As 2 O 3 , n=2, As 2 O 3 +ATRA, n=2). CR2 was achieved in all patients with further As 2 O 3 -based therapy, although 2 patients ultimately relapsed again and died of refractory leukemia. Of the 45 patients in continuous CR1, 3 patients had died of unrelated causes (stroke at 62 months, nasopharyngeal carcinoma at 24 months, carcinoma of colon at 86 months). Three other solid tumors (carcinoma of colon, n=2; salivary gland cancer, n=1) were diagnosed. Of the 5 solid tumors found in this cohort, only 1 was diagnosed after commencement of As 2 O 3 -maintenance. The 3-year leukemia-free-survival and overall-survival were 89% and 77%. There was no difference in survival between patients receiving different oral-As 2 O 3 maintenance regimens, and stratified according to risk factors. Adverse effects of the oral-As 2 O 3 maintenance included headache (n=18), gastric discomfort (n=7), herpes zoster reactivation (n=10), reversible liver function derangement (n=12), menorrhagia (n=3), and rash (n=8). Clinical arrhythmias were not observed. There were no defaults in treatment due to side effects. Conclusion. Oral-As 2 O 3 maintenance is a simple regimen that is well tolerated, entirely oral and administered at home. This regimen considerably reduces exposure to anthracyclines, topoisomerase II inhibitors and anti-metabolites as used in other protocols, which is potentially advantageous for a curable leukemia, in view of chemotherapyinduced long-term complications. Although >60% of our patients belonged to intermediate and high-risk groups, this regimen was comparable to other multi-chemotherapy regimens in maintaining remission.",
