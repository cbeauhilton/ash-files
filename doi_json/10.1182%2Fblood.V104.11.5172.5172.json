    "abstract_text": "An optimum conditioning regimen is indispensable in improving outcomes for patients with acquired aplastic anemia (AA) who receive bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from an alternative donor. Although high-dose total body irradiation (TBI) is effective in enhancing engraftment, intensive conditioning regimens are associated with increased regimen-related toxicity, which results in a decreased success rate. Currently, two different approaches are primarily used; a conditioning regimen including low-dose TBI and a fludarabin-based regimen without TBI. We attempt to clarify the efficacy and regimen-related toxicity of these two approaches. Ten patients (7 males, 3 females; median age 12y; range 9\u201317y) underwent an alternative donor transplant following a conditioning regimen with low-dose TBI (TBI group); patients received cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/d on days \u22125 to \u22122), antithymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin, 2.5 mg/kg/d on days \u22125 to \u22122) and TBI (2.5 Gy x 2 on day \u22121). The donor was unrelated in 9 patients (3 were serologically HLA A or B antigen mismatched; 3 were serologically HLA DR antigen mismatched, 1 was both serologically and genotypically DR antigen mismatched; 1 was genotypically DRB1 mismatched; 1 was a genotypically complete match) and was a family member in 1 patient (serologically HLA A-mismatched father). Twelve patients (6 males, 6 females; median age, 11 y; range 2\u201320 y) received a conditioning regimen of fludarabine (25 mg/kg/d on days \u22125 to \u22122), cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m 2 /d on days \u22125 to \u22122), thymoglobulin (1.5 mg/kg/d on days \u22125 to \u22122) and thoracoabdominal irradiation (TAI, 3Gy x 1 on day \u22121) (TAI group). The donor was unrelated in 11 patients (8 were genotypically complete matches, and 3 were genotypically DRB1 antigen mismatched) and a family member in 1 patient (3 antigen-mismatched mother). The source of stem cells was unmanipulated bone marrow. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus (0.02 mg/kg from day \u22121) and short-term methotrexate. Rejection was seen in one patient in each group. The doses of infused nucleated marrow cells were less than 2.0 x 10 8 /kg in both patients, and both patients then received a second transplant and achieved full donor chimerism. Acute GVHD grade II-IV developed in 2/10 evaluable patients in the TBI group and in 3/12 patients in the TAI group. Chronic GVHD developed in 5/9 evaluable patients in TBI group and 3/10 evaluable patients in TAI group. Median follow up was 9 months (4\u201327 months) in the TBI group and 21 months (3\u201333 months) in the TAI group. Both conditioning regimens were well tolerated and effective even in HLA-mismatched unrelated donor transplantation. Long-term follow up is warranted in order to compare the late sequelae in both regimens.",
