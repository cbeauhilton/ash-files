    "abstract_text": "Purpose: The number and activity of osteoclasts (OCs) are strongly enhanced by myeloma cells, leading to significant bone lesion in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Mechanisms remain elusive whether myeloma-supporting OCs also induce suppressive immune bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Methods: We examined if OCs could modulate T cell-mediated anti-MM immunity; Inhibitory immune molecules expression during osteoclastogenesis; The impact of APRIL on PDL1 expression in MM and the pathway; The impact of Anti-CD38 mAb on osteoclastogenesis and T cell response; Results: Here, we first show that OCs significantly protect MM cells against T cell-mediated cytotoxicity via direct inhibition of proliferating CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. The immune checkpoint molecules PDL1, Galectin-9, HVEM, and CD200, as well as T cell metabolism regulators indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) and CD38 are significantly up-regulated during osteoclastogenesis. Importantly, levels of these molecules, except CD38, are higher in OCs than MM cells. Anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibody and IDO inhibitor partly overcome OC-inhibited T cell responses against MM cells, confirming their roles in OC-suppressed MM cell lysis by cytotoxic T cells. In addition, Galectin-9 and a proliferation-induced ligand (APRIL), mainly secreted by OCs, are significantly up-regulated during osteoclastogenesis. Galectin-9 specifically induces apoptosis of T cells while sparing monocytes and MM cells. APRIL induces PDL1 expression in MM cells, providing additional immune inhibition by OCs. Moreover, CD38 is significantly up-regulated during osteoclastogenesis. When targeted by an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, suppressive T cell function by OCs is alleviated, associated with down-regulation of HVEM and IDO. Conclusion: Taken together, these results define expression of multiple immune proteins and cytokines in OCs essential for suppressive MM BM milieu. These results further support combination of targeting these molecules to improve anti-MM immunity.
