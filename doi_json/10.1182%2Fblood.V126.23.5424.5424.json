    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Adoptive transfer of gene modified T cells (ACT) with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) is becoming a clinically relevant immunotherapy approach for cancer treatment. One important question involves the selection of the T cell subpopulation for gene-modified ACT. Recent preclinical studies have shown that memory stem T cells (T SCM ) (with a phenotype CD45RO - , CD45RA + , CCR7 + , CD62L + , CD95 + ) have higher in vivo persistence, self-renewal, proliferative and antitumor capacities compared to other memory and effector T cell subpopulations. For these reasons, T SCM may represent an ideal candidate for ACT with CARs. Ex vivo generation of T SCM rely on CD3/CD28 costimulation and the use of cytokines such as IL-7 and IL-15 during the entire culture period. However, a strong costimulation may induce differentiation of T SCM to effector memory T cells. In this study, we have analyzed the impact of the costimulation length and the addition of the IL-21 on the ex vivo generation of T SCM cells. Methods: Purified na\u00efve T cells from healthy donors were cultured in the presence of anti-CD3/CD28 coated beads, IL-7, IL-15 and/or IL-21 (25ng/ml). T cells phenotype from the different memory (T CM , T SCM and T EM ) and effector subpopulations were analyzed by multiparametric flow cytometry. Particularly, T SCM were identified by a specific plotting strategy. Briefly, CD4 + and CD8 + cells were gated and a CCR7 against CD45RO plot were used to select CCR7 + CD45RO - cells in each subpopulation. Within these cells, a CCR7 + CD45RO - CD45RA + cell population was identified by plotting CCR7 against CD45RA. Then, CD27 was used to detect CCR7 + CD45RO - CD45RA + CD27 + cells. Finally, a plot of CD95 against CCR7 was used to identify the CCR7 + CD45RO - CD45RA + CD27 + CD95 + cell population. Cellular proliferation was analyzed by flow cytometry using CFSE. Results: A short (48 hours) anti-CD3/CD28 costimulation of na\u00efve T cells combined with IL-7 and IL-15 significantly increased the frequencies of CD4 + and CD8 + T SCM ex vivo , compared to a long (10 days) costimulation (34.6%\u00b14.4% vs 15.6%\u00b14.24% for CD4 + ; p=0.008, and 20.5%\u00b14.00% vs 7.7%\u00b12.53% for CD8 + ; p=0.02). Moreover, the addition of IL-21 to this condition further enhanced the enrichment (47.9%\u00b14.1% vs 34.6%\u00b14.4% for CD4 + ; p=0.006, and 34.1%\u00b13.5% vs 20.5%\u00b14% for CD8 + ; p<0.0005) and expansion of CD4 + and CD8 + T SCM, with an increase in absolute numbers (311.3\u00b139 vs 192.8\u00b158.6 fold expansion in CD4 + ; p=0.04, and 728.1\u00b153 vs 442.7\u00b1122 fold expansion in CD8 + ; p=0.04). In addition, IL-21 did not preferentially enriched for the CD8 + population since the CD4 + T SCM were maintained over the cell culture period in all the conditions tested (CD4 + /CD8 + T SCM ratio:1.03\u00b10.28 vs 1.34\u00b10.19 for long costimulation versus long + IL-21, and 0.68\u00b10.14 vs 0.72\u00b10.002 for short vs short + IL-21; p=0.23). Conclusion: We show that these refined in vitro conditions significantly increase the frequencies and expansion of T SCM . Since the reagents used are available in a clinical grade setting, these data may have relevant clinical implications for the generation of this memory T cell subset for adoptive cell therapy with CAR-T cells of patients with cancer.
