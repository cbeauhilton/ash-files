    "abstract_text": "This protocol followed the first GOELAMS protocol (also presented at ASH 2006) for MCL pts testing the addition of Rituximab with the VAD+C regimen followed by ASCT. Thirty nine pts were included in this phase II prospective study opened between January 2003 and December 2005. Inclusion criteria: MCL by the WHO (common or blastoi\u0308d variants), under 65 years with PS under 3, who never received chemotherapy. Treatment: the first step consist of 4 courses of R-VAD+C regimen (J1, Rituximab 375 mg/sqm; J1 to J4, Vincristin 0,4 mg/D, Adriblastin 9 mg/D and Dexamethasone 40 mg/D; J20 to J29 Chlorambucil 12 mg/D) every 35 days. Evaluation after 4 cycles with the Cheson criterias. Responders (at least 50%) have been collected after a 4 g/sqm cyclophosphamide stimulation and an in vivo purge with rituximab (375). Then, the second step consisted on one R-VAD+C and one VAD+C regimens followed by the transplantation prepared by the myeloablative regimen including Alkeran 140 mg/sqm and 8 grays/4 fr TBI. Results: 38/39 pts are evaluable. 34 biopsies were reviewed and consisted of 26 common forms and 8 blastoi\u0308d variants. 4 other diagnosis were possible only on blood (n=3) or bone marrow (n=1) analysis. Treatment: 28/38 (74%) have had a response to the first 4 R-VAD+C, 6 progressed (16%) and 4 (10%) have had only a minor response under 50%. 17/38pts (44,5%) were in CR or CRu after 4 R-VAD+C courses and 11 (29%) in PR>50%. Among the 23 pts evaluated after the transplantation, 20 were in CR, two progressed and one have a PR>50%. Survival: With a median follow-up of 19 months, OS and PFS at 2 years are 80% and 50 % respectively. The PFS is significantly affected by the Goelams Index for MCL described recently from a cohort of patients studied in our previous protocol (see abstract ASH 2006). Conclusion The R-VAD+C regimen followed by PBSCT is a good sequence for the treatment in first line of MCL patients, especially for those with a good prognosis profile defined by the new Goelams prognostic index which would worth being tested on a larger cohort."
