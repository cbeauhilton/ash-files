    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1089 Poster Board I-111 Fanconi anemia (FA) is a human genomic instability syndrome that is uniquely sensitive to oxidative stress. Members of the FA protein family are involved in repair of genetic damage caused by DNA cross-linkers. The molecular pathway in which the FA proteins function in oxidative stress response has not been defined. Here we report functional interaction between the FA protein FANCD2 and the forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a in response to oxidative stress. FOXO3a was colocalized to FANCD2 foci in cells subjected to oxidative stress. The FANCD2-FOXO3a complex was not detected in cells deficient for the FA core complex component FANCA, but could be restored after complementation with a functional FANCA. Consistent with this, a non-monoubiquitinated FANCD2 mutant failed to bind FOXO3a. While both DNA cross-linker mitomycin C and ionizing radiation induced monoubiquitination of FANCD2, neither was able to induce the association of FANCD2 and FOXO3a. This indicates that the FOXO3a-FANCD2 interaction is oxidative stress specific. Overexpression of FOXO3a reduced abnormal accumulation of reactive oxygen species, enhanced cellular resistance to oxidative stress, and increased antioxidant gene expression in corrected but not mutant FA-D2 cells. The novel oxidative stress response pathway converging FANCD2 and FOXO3a identified in this study is likely to contribute to cellular anti-oxidant defense.
