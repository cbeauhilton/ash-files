    "abstract_text": "Background and objectives: The survival rates of children with acute leukemia is consistently improving, due to the lower relapse rates in addition to reducing treatment-related mortality, which is mainly a result of infectious causes. The aim of the study is to describe the incidence and risk factors associated with early deaths (first 42 days in treatment) among children with acute leukemia. Methods: This is a retrospective study included newly diagnosed patients with acute leukemia who presented to the National Cancer Institute, Cairo University between Jan. 2011 to Dec. 2013. Patients' data were collected from their files and analyzed for the total and early death rates and proposed causes of death. Results: The study included 370 patients, 253 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 100 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 17 with mixed phenotypic acute leukemia (MPAL). The total death rate among the whole group was 40.5% (n=150) and induction death rate was 19.2% (n=71). AML was accompanied with higher rates of total and induction deaths as they were 58% and 25% respectively, compared to 33.6% and 17.4% in ALL. These early deaths were attributed mostly to infection 64.7% (n=46) and cerebrovascular accidents 18.3% (n=13). Early deaths were significantly higher in patients with age below 2 years old (p. value=0.008), and in those with poor response to therapy (p. value= 0.001). Using enhanced supportive care measures as better infection control, appropriate antibiotic guidelines and available intensive care unit during 2013 had significantly reduced the overall and induction mortality rates (27.8% and 13.8% respectively in 2013 versus 45% and 20.3% in 2011 and 49% and 25% in 2012). Conclusion: Induction deaths in pediatric acute leukemia remain a major challenge in developing countries and constitute an increasing fraction of all deaths. Accordingly, using a well equipped cancer centers with better supportive care guidelines is essential to further improve the survival in these group of patients.
