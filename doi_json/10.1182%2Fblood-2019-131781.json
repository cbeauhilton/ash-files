    "abstract_text": "BCR-ABL1 point mutation-mediated resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia is effectively managed with several approved drugs, including ponatinib for BCR-ABL1 T315I -mutant disease. However, for those patients who acquire BCR-ABL1 compound mutations (multiple mutations in the same BCR-ABL1 molecule), therapy options are extremely limited. Asciminib (formerly ABL001) is a recently developed allosteric inhibitor targeting the myristoyl-binding pocket of ABL1 kinase with activity against many imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL1 mutants, including T315I. We profiled asciminib against a panel of BCR-ABL1 single and compound mutants expressed in murine Ba/F3 cells. Asciminib potently inhibited the proliferation of most imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL1 point mutations tested, with the notable exception of substitutions at position F359, which conferred high levels of resistance. Consistent with this finding, next-generation sequencing of BCR-ABL1 in five patients with evidence of clinical resistance to asciminib revealed three patients with expansion of variants of position F359 on treatment. Cell-based mutagenesis screens starting from Ba/F3 cells expressing native BCR-ABL1 revealed a resistance profile for asciminib largely centered around residues of the myristoyl pocket, with these mutants remaining sensitive to approved ATP-site ABL1 TKIs. Combining asciminib with ATP-site TKIs enhanced target inhibition and suppression of resistant BCR-ABL1 point mutant outgrowth in Ph+ clinical isolates and cell lines. However, despite its unique binding mode, asciminib was ineffective against all tested BCR-ABL1 compound mutants. In contrast, combining asciminib with ponatinib re-sensitized even the problematic, currently untreatable T315I-inclusive compound mutants at clinically achievable concentrations, which was not achieved combining asciminib with other approved ATP-site TKIs. Additionally, the combination of asciminib with ponatinib resulted in suppression of T315I-inclusive compound mutant resistant clones using in vitro mutagenesis screens and significantly prolonged survival compared to either single agent in an in vivo T315I-inclusive compound mutant mouse xenograft model. Molecular dynamics-based structural modeling were performed and offer further insight into the mechanism of this combination's efficacy. Taken together, our findings support combining asciminib with ponatinib as a treatment strategy for improved management and mitigating the emergence of highly resistant BCR-ABL1 compound mutations in patients with Ph+ leukemia.
