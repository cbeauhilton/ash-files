    "abstract_text": "Background. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are circulating precursors with the capacity to differentiate into endothelial lineage cells through a process known as \u201cvasculogenesis\u201d thus contributing to vessel formation. We studied the role of endothelial progenitor cells in multiple myeloma (MM) pathogenesis. Methods. EPC levels were evaluated in peripheral blood (PB) of patients with smoldering MM (SMM), and active myeloma (MM) and in PB of healthy controls, by using flow-cytometry (CD34+VEGFR2+ cells), and by performing endothelial colony forming assays. EPC levels were studied in PB from transgenic Vk*MYC mice harboring either early MM (smoldering-like stage); or late (active MM-like stage); as well as in mice injected intravenously with either murine MM 5TGM1-turboRFP+ cells or human MM1S-GFP+/luc+ cells. Healthy syngeneic mice were used as controls. GFP-bone marrow (BM) transplantation and sub-cutaneous femur implantation were performed in recipient mice to study EPC BM mobilization (GFP+CD34+VEGFR2 cells) and EPC BM recruitment to the implanted femurs during 5TGM1 MM model progression. Transgenic ID1+/-ID3-/- mice (with a defect in EPC mobilization and differentiation ability) were injected with transplantable Vk*MYC cells and followed for survival. Wild type littermates were used as controls. Similar experiments were performed using transgenic ID1+/-ID3-/- mice transplanted with BM of wild type littermates. Therapeutic activity of DC101 anti-murine VEGFR2 Ab was evaluated in the MM1S human orthotopic xenograft model, using both early and late treatment approaches. Results. EPC levels were significantly increased in PB of MM patients, including SMM, compared to healthy controls (P<0.05). PB mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SMM and aMM patients showed an increase ability to form both EC-CFUs (P<0.01) and ECFCs compared to those from healthy controls (P<0.05). EPC levels were significantly increased in PB of transgenic Vk*MYC mice at both early and advanced stage of MM development compared to healthy syngenic mice. In orthotopic MM models we found that levels of circulating EPCs increase early after i.v. injection of either human MM1S-GFP+/luc+ cells (1.5 and 2 times higher after 1 week and 2 weeks, respectively) or murine 5TGM1-turboRFP+ MM cells (2.5 and 3 times higher after 2 and 3 weeks, respectively) compared to na\u00efve mice. By coupling GFP-BM transplantation and subcutaneous femur implantation, we generated a new model that allows the study of BM derived-cell trafficking from one site to another of the BM. The levels of BM-derived GFP+ EPC increased early after i.v. injection of 5TGM1-turboRFP+ cells (2 times increase after 2 weeks, P<0.01); also, the percentage of both total GFP+ cells (7.92% versus 2.635%, P<0.05) and GFP+ EPCs (0.22% versus 0.068%, P<0.05) increased in the BM of implanted femurs of tumor cell injected mice compared to controls. Survival of ID1+/-ID3-/- mice was significantly increased compared to that of wild type littermates after injection of MM Vk*MYC cells (62 versus 27 days median survival time, P=0.0005); this survival advantage was lost after wild type BM was transplanted in ID1+/-ID3-/- mice (34 versus 35 days median survival time). In human MM1S orthotopic xenograft model, treatment with anti-murine VEGFR2 DC101 Ab was able to inhibit MM progression when treatment was started early during smoldering like stages, but not when it was started after significant tumor burden (50.5, 41.5 and 40 days median survival time in DC101 early, late and untargeted IgG treated mice respectively) Conclusion. These results show that EPC mediated vasculogenesis is an important pathogenic process that occurs during the early/smoldering MM stage. Knockout mouse experiments confirm that EPCs are essential for MM tumor progression. These results indicate that anti-angiogenic agents could be effective as an early therapeutic intervention in SMM patients.
