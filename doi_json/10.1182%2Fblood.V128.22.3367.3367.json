    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Endogenous or gene-modified T cells with T cell receptors (TCRs) are major designs of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) therapies. However, gene-modified TCR-CTL therapies targeting on malignant tumors have been generally unsuccessful in previous clinical trials. The major reasons were poor expansion and short persistence of CTL. To overcome these problems, TCR-affinity have been genetically enhanced, but often resulted in life-threatening toxicities. We aimed to modify TCR-CTL in order to improve the function by enhancing intracellular signaling after TCR ligation without affinity modulation. Method: We generated three artificial T cell activating adapter molecules (ATAM), which are CD3z, CD3z/CD28, and CD3z/4-1BB. CD28 or 4-1BB intracellular domain was inserted in the middle of CD3z intracellular domain, so that they can assemble with internal TCR complex when stimulated with corresponding antigen. ATAM-T2A-tEGFR was packaged into retrovirus vector to transduce the T cells. In order to evaluate the functional alteration, we established ATAM-CMV CTL model. We stimulated T cells with CMV pp65 peptide to induce endogenous CMV CTL. On day 4 after stimulation, ATAMs were retrovirally transduced into CMV CTL. After a selection with anti-EGFR mAb, we achieved more than 90% purity of ATAM positive CMV CTL and used in 51 Cr release assay, cytokine release assay, and the growth assay. In the growth assay, we stimulated the ATAM CMV-CTL weekly and assayed the viable cell number, tetramer positivity, phenotype, and apoptosis. Regarding these assay, we used HLA transduced K562 (HLA-K562) as APC. Results: First, we confirmed the expression of each ATAM on CD8+ T cells, which showed similar expression among each ATAM. To determine the cytotoxicity of CMV CTL according to each ATAM or control tEGFR transduction, we performed 51 Cr release assay against HLA-K562 pulsed with or without CMV peptide. In the presence of CMV peptide, each ATAM-CMV CTL showed similar cytolytic activities to control CMV CTL. [specific lysis (%): tEGFR 32.0+-6.0, CD3z 32.4+-2.6, CD3z/CD28 31.1+-8.8, and CD3z/4-1BB 37.4+-1.5: at an E:T ratio = 3:1, respectively}. In the intracellular cytokine assay against HLA-K562 pulsed with CMV peptide, similar proportions of responder were positive for IFN-g and IL-2 in control and ATAM-CMV CTL. [IFN-g (%): tEGFR, 67.3+-9.4, CD3z, 69.0+-7.4, CD3z/CD28, 66.5+-8.0, and CD3z/4-1BB, 69.6+-7.9; IL-2 (%): tEGFR, 17.5+-5.0, CD3z, 17.7+-4.3, CD3z/CD28, 15.9+-4.3, and CD3z/4-1BB, 18.9+-4.8, respectively]. The cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion upon irrelevant stimulation were completely negative among each ATAM-CMV CTL. Although the surface phenotype was not changed in control CMV-CTL, that of ATAMs-CMV CTL was significantly expanded after antigen stimulation [central memory (CD45RA-CD62L+) (%): tEGFR, 6.0+-2.9, CD3z, 26.8+-11.1, CD3z/CD28, 19.4+-9.5, and CD3z/4-1BB, 35.8+-26.8: at 7 days after stimulation]. Regarding the cell growth, CD3z/CD28 and CD3z/4-1BB showed greater CTL expansion upon weekly antigen stimulation. The fold expansion of tEGFR, CD3z, CD3z/CD28, and CD3z/4-1BB-CMV CTL were 4.9+-0.7, 8.2+-2.4, 12.3+-1.1, and 13.0+-1.6 at day7, 1.6+-0.4, 8.0+-2.5, 18.6+-3.9, and 21.3+-7.7 at day14, and 0.4+-0.2, 1.4+-0.7, 5.1+-3.0, and 30.4+-22.9 at day21, respectively (Fig). Comparing with control, CD3z/4-1BB-CMV CTL showed continuous greater expansion after several stimulations (p\u02c20.01: during day0 to day7, p\u02c20.05: during day7 to day14). To examine the reason for the growth advantage, we investigated the apoptosis after the stimulation with DAPI/Annexin V staining. It revealed that the live cells after specific stimulation elevated in ATAMs-CMV CTL compared with control CMV CTL. Conclusion: We generated three ATAMs and successfully transduced into CMV CTL. Particularly, the whole cell growth and continuance of growth after weekly stimulation were significantly improved in CD3z/4-1BB CTL. This greater cell expansion may improve in vivo persistence and further effectiveness of TCR-CTL therapy. ATAM-CMV CTL did not recognize any APC without corresponding peptide, indicating that ATAM transduction could improve the CTL effectiveness without altering CTL specificity. Thus we believe that we could potentially apply ATAM transduction to other TCR-CTLs targeting malignant tumors safely.
