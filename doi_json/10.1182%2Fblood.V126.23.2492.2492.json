    "abstract_text": "Background Asparaginase is a cornerstone in the treatment of ALL, but its utility is limited by toxicities including hypersensitivity. Clinical allergy is associated with inactivation of asparaginase by antibodies, which can also neutralize asparaginase without any clinical signs of hypersensitivity (silent inactivation). GRASPA (eryaspase - proposed INN) is an L-asparaginase encapsulated into the red blood cells. In a recent Phase III trial, it has shown to prolong the asparaginase activity and significantly reduce the incidence of allergic reactions in pts with relapsed ALL. Methods This open, randomized international Phase 3 study enrolled pts with relapsed ALL. The co-primary endpoints were the mean duration of asparaginase (ASPA) activity > 100 IU/L and incidence of hypersensitivity reactions during induction phase. Key secondary endpoints were safety, tolerability, complete remission and minimal residual disease rate, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-ASPA antibodies at baseline. Pts (n=80), aged 1-55 years without prior hypersensitivity were randomized to GRASPA (150 IU/kg, n=26, Arm A) or native L-asparaginase (L-ASP, 10,000 IU/m\u00b2, n= 28, Arm B). Additionally, 26 pts with prior hypersensitivity were treated with GRASPA in a single stratum (Arm C, GRASPA-s). All pts received COOPRALL protocol as a backbone chemotherapy. Here we report the report the PK of asparaginase activity, and PD effects. Results A total of 80 pts enrolled into the trial. A total 100% and 96% of patients had at least one day with asparaginase level >100 IU/L during induction, with GRASPA and L-ASP, respectively. Only one patient in L-Asp group did not reach this threshold. All patients in Arm C have also achieved total blood asparaginase level > 100 IU/L during induction. Prolonged ASPA activity was maintained across several key subpopulations as follows: Table 1.  . GRASPA . L-ASP . GRASPA . L-ASP .

The median times from first assessment of activity > 100 IU/L to loss of activity was not reached in the GRASPA arm by Day 28, but was 15 days in the L-ASP arm. The difference was statistically significant (table below). Similar trend was also observed with GRASPA-s. Table 2.

Conclusion GRASPA consistently demonstrated activity compared to L-ASP for the treatment of pts with relapsed ALL, and is therefore a suitable option for patients with relapsed ALL.
