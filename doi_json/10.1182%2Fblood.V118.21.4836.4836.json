    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4836 Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic hemolytic and inflammatory disorder characterized by repeated episodes of vaso-occlusion and hemolysis, resulting in oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. We have recently demonstrated that the heme scavenging capacity in SCD is severely impaired, highlighting the danger posed by excess heme in this disorder. Paradoxically, heme induces expression of several cyto-protective enzymes including the modifier subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCLM), the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione (GSH) synthesis, which is a crucial antioxidant in the lung. While the induction of cytoprotective enzymes is thought to attenuate the deleterious effects of heme in SCD the somatic origin of this protection has not previously been defined. Using transgenic mouse models we show for the first time that the level of GCLM in the sickle lung is markedly up-regulated due primarily to enhanced expression of the enzyme in the epithelium and blood mononuclear cells, but not in the endothelium. Based on these findings, we tested the hypothesis that leukocyte-derived GCLM was sufficient to protect the sickle lung from oxidative stress. Thus, bone marrow chimeric SCD mice with GCLM deficiency were generated by transplanting bone marrow from Berkeley SCD transgenic mice into GCLM null mice recipients. We confirmed that the chimeric GCLM-null-SCD mice had a SCD phenotype as determined by >95% engraftment of donor white blood cells, reticulocyte counts, urine osmolality and hemoglobin gel electrophoresis. Whole lung GCLM and total GSH levels in the chimeric mice were identical to the levels in the wild-type SCD mice. Moreover, lung function, as determined by oxygen saturation and breath rate, were identical in the two mouse strains. These results show that loss of GCLM expression in resident lung cells does not compromise production of GSH or the function of the lung in SCD.
