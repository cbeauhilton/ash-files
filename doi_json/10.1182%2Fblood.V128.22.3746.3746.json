    "abstract_text": "Objective: Thrombocytopenia is a common clinical problem in patients with cancer or bone marrow transplantation. Currently it is mainly managed by platelet transfusion. Repeated platelet transfusions are associated with the risks of transfusion reactions/alloimmunisation and may lead to platelet refractoriness. Infusion of ex vivo expanded megakaryocytic (MK) progenitor cells is other strategy for the treatment of thrombocytopenia. This study aimed to establish efficient conditions for the expansion of the MK progenitors from enriched CD34(+) cells of umbilical cord blood. Methods: This study investigated the effect of flt-3 ligang (FL), stem cell factor (SCF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in combination with other megakaryocyte-promoting cytokines such as thrombopoietin (TPO) on the differentiation and proliferation of megakaryocytic progenitors. As an early acting growth factor, FL may promote the ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We compared the effects of FL and SCF in combination with other megakaryocyte-promoting cytokines in megakaryocytic progenitors. Results: In liquid cultures of enriched CD34+ cells from human umbilical cord blood for 14 days, FL plus TPO, interleukin-3 (IL-3), and IL-6 promoted the expansion of nucleated cells, CD34+ cells, CD34+ CD38- cells, and megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-MK) by 300 +/- 115-, 23.8 +/- 11.3-, 33.9 +/- 28.6-, and 584 +/- 220-fold, respectively. Replacing FL with SCF significantly decreased the yield of all cell types. While one human acute lymphoblastic leukemia sample expressed high levels of flt-3 receptor, the four megakaryocytic cell lines (Meg-01, CHRF-288-11, M-07e, and Dami) did not show any positive expression. Our data suggest that the effect of FL in augmenting the expansion of MK progenitors might be due to the early action of FL at the pluripotent stem cell stage. Our results also demonstrated that TPO alone produced a high proportion of CD61(+)CD41(+) cells but a low total cell count and high cell death, resulting in an inferior expansion. The addition of in IL-1 beta, FL and to a lesser extent IL-3 improved the expansion outcome. The treatment groups with three to five cytokines produced efficient expansions of CFU-MK up to 400-fold with the highest yield observed in the presence of TPO, IL-1 beta, IL-3, IL-6 and FL. CD34(+) cells were expanded by five to 22-fold. PDGF improved the expansion of all cell types with CD61(+)CD41(+) cells, CFU-MK and CD34(+) cells increased by 101%, 134% and 70%, respectively. More significantly, PDGF enhanced the engraftment of human CD45+ cells and their myeloid subsets (CD33+, CD14+ cells) in NOD/SCID mice. Conclusions: This study showed that the present cytokine combination and expansion conditions provide an effective and potentially useful system for the clinical expansion of cord blood for bone marrow transplantation (BMT). PDGF might be a suitable growth factor to improve the ex vivo expansion of MK progenitors for clinical applications.
