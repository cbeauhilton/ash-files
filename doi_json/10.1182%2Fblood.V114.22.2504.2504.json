    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2504 Poster Board II-481 Polyinosinic:polycytidlyic acid (poly I:C) is a synthetic double-stranded RNA used to mimic viral infections in order to study immune responses and to activate gene deletion in lox-p systems employing a Cre gene responsive to an Mx-1 promoter. Recent observations made by us and others have suggested hematopoietic stem cells, responding to either poly I:C administration or interferon directly, enter cell cycle. Twenty-two hours following a single 100mg intraperitoneal injection of poly I:C into 10-12 week old male C57Bl/6 mice, the mice were injected with a single pulse of BrdU. Two hours later, bone marrow was harvested from legs and stained for Lineage, Sca-1, ckit, CD48, IL7R, and BrdU. In two independent experiments, each with n = 4, 41 and 33% of Lin- Sca-1+ cKit+ (LSK) IL-7R- CD48- cells from poly I:C-treated mice had incorporated BrdU, compared to 7 and 10% in cells from PBS-treated mice. These data support recently published reports. Total bone marrow cellularity was reduced to 45 and 57% in the two experiments, indicating either a rapid death and/or mobilization of marrow cells. Despite this dramatic loss of hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow of poly I:C treated mice, the number of IL-7R- CD48- LSK cells increased 145 and 308% in the two independent experiments. Importantly, the level of Sca-1 expression increased dramatically in the bone marrow of poly I:C-treated mice. Both the percent of Sca-1+ cells and the expression level of Sca-1 on a per cell basis increased after twenty-four hours of poly I:C, with some cells acquiring levels of Sca-1 that are missing from control bone marrow. These data were duplicated in vitro. When total marrow cells were cultured overnight in media containing either PBS or 25mg/mL poly I:C, percent of Sca-1+ cells increased from 23.6 to 43.7%. Within the Sca-1+ fraction of poly I:C-treated cultures, 16.7% had acquired very high levels of Sca-1, compared to only 1.75% in control cultures. Quantitative RT-PCR was employed to measure a greater than 2-fold increase in the amount of Sca-1 mRNA in poly I:C-treated cultures. Whereas the numbers of LSK cells increased in vivo, CD150+/\u2212 CD48- IL-7R- Lin- Sca-1- cKit+ myeloid progenitors almost completely disappeared following poly I:C treatment, dropping to 18.59% of control marrow, a reduction that is disproportionately large compared to the overall loss of hematopoietic cells in the marrow. These cells are normally proliferative, with 77.1 and 70.53% accumulating BrdU during the 2-hour pulse in PBS and poly I:C-treated mice, respectively. Interestingly, when Sca-1 is excluded from the analysis, the percent of Lin- IL7R- CD48- cKit+ cells incorporating BrdU decreases following poly I:C treatment, in keeping with interferon's published role as a cell cycle repressor. One possible interpretation of these data is that the increased proliferation of LSK cells noted by us and others is actually the result of Sca-1 acquisition by normally proliferating Sca-1- myeloid progenitors. This new hypothesis is currently being investigated. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
