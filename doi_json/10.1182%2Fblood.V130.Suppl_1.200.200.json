    "abstract_text": "Background: The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) (Blood 2009;113:2895) , the dynamic(D) IPSS (Blood 2010;115:1703) and the DIPSS-plus ( JCO 2011;29:392 ) are commonly used to predict survival among patients (pts) with Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF). These scores were developed using populations of PMF pts that differ from the 2 categories outlined in the 2016 WHO criteria, i.e. prefibrotic and overt PMF (Blood 2016; 127:2391) ; indeed, IPSS performed suboptimally when applied to the two PMF variants (Blood 2017; 129:3227) . The prognostic relevance of fibrosis grade and mutation profile, including both driver ( JAK2/CALR/MPL ) and other myeloid malignancies-associated genes (Blood 2017; 129:3227) , has been shown. Furthermore, high molecular risk category (HMR), including pts with any one mutated genes of ASXL1, SRSF2, EZH2, IDH1/2 ( Leukemia 2013; 27:1861 ), and unfavorable karyotype ( JCO 2011;29:392 ) , both provided IPSS/DIPSS-independent prognostic information for overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS). The aim of current study was to develop an updated prognostic score that included molecular (MIPSS70) and, when available, cytogenetic information (MIPSS70-plus), specifically directed to pts with pre-PMF and overt-PMF 70yr old and younger that are potential candidates to stem cell transplantation (SCT). Methods : Previously published methods were used to sequence JAK2, MPL, CALR, EZH2, ASXL1, IDH1/2 and SRSF2 . Survival was calculated from date of diagnosis (AGIMM cohort) or date of first referral (Mayo cohort). A Cox model with a stepwise selection procedure was used to select covariates significant for OS. The prognostic model was developed based on the magnitude of the hazard ratios (HR) in the training cohort. Results: Development of MIPSS70. The learning cohort included 490 pts aged <70y (225 Pre-PMF, 265 overt-PMF) from 6 Italian institutions (AGIMM group). During a median FU of 5.8y (6.8y pre-PMF, 5.22y overt PMF), 25.3% of pre-PMF and 50.2% of overt-PMF pts died and 63 (9.8% pre-PMF, 15.5% overt PMF) progressed to leukemia. Mutation frequency was: JAK2 V617F 58%, CALR 26% (76% type1/like, 24% type2/like), MPL 5%, ASXL1 23%, SRSF2 7%, EZH2 6%, IDH1/2 2.7%; 30.8% were HMR-positive with 8% of pts presenting >2 HMR mutated genes. A HR-weighted score was assigned to variables maintaining significance in multivariable analysis: 2.0 points to leukocytes >25x10 9 /L, platelets <100x10 9 /L, >2 HMR mutations; 1.0 point to hemoglobin 2, absence of CALR type1/like, HMR category. Accordingly, 3 risk categories were delineated (Fig 1A): Low (score 0-1); Intermediate(score 2-4); and High (score >5) with 10-y survival of 83%, 39% and 12%, respectively. MIPSS70 yielded a better prediction of OS in a ROC analysis (MIPSS70 AUC = 0.760 vs. IPSS AUC = 0.710). Significantly different (p<0.0001) LFS was also predicted by the 3 risk categories. The aforementioned observations were validated in an external cohort of 223 patients from Mayo Clinic ( details to follow at time of presentation ). Finally, we showed that MIPSS70 efficiently resolved patients aged >70y in both cohorts. Development of MIPSS70-plus. The learning cohort included 209 cytogenetically-annotated pts, aged \u226470y, from Mayo Clinic. Unfavorable vs favorable karyotype was added to the multivariable model that included all 8 MIPSS70 variables. Unfavorable karyotype (HR 2.6), presence of one (HR 1.7) or \u22652 (HR 2.3) HMR mutations, absence of type1/like CALR (HR 2.2), constitutional symptoms (HR 2.4), circulating blasts \u22652% (HR 1.7) and hemoglobin <10 g/dL (HR 1.5) remained significant. Based on HR-weighted scoring of these 6 variables, 4 risk categories were established and effectively predicted OS (Figure 1B) and LFS. These observations were validated in a separate cohort of 260 pts from the AGIMM group ( details to follow at time of presentation ). The MIPP70-plus was also effective in pts aged >70y. Conclusions. The new MIPSS70 and MIPSS70-plus scores include modern disease-associated, risk variables pertinent to both pre-PMF and overt-PMF according to the 2016 WHO classification, and are intended to facilitate decision-making for patients 70yr old and younger who are potential candidates to SCT.
