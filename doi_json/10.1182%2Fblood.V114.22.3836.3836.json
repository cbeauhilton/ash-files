    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3836 Poster Board III-772 Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), potent cytotoxic drugs linked to antibodies via specialized chemical linkers, provide a means to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy by targeting the drug to neoplastic cells while reducing side effects. Target selection is a key component to the success of an ADC. In addition to expression on the tumor, the target should have limited expression on normal tissues. The most prevalent and best-studied surface antigens on multiple myeloma (MM) cells, CD138, CD38, CD72, and CD56, all have relatively broad expression patterns that may lead to target-dependent toxicities with ADCs. We have previously shown that FcRL5/FcRH5/IRTA2 is expressed only on B-cells and plasma cells. Here we show that FcRL5 is expressed on the surface of MM cells from 85% of patients and thus could be a target for antibody and ADC treatments of MM. As experience in humans with anti-CD20 antibodies suggests that depletion of B-cells does not present a major safety issue, FcRL5 appears to have an excellent expression pattern as an ADC target for MM. Internalization of target antigens is known to increase the efficacy of ADCs and we found that FcRL5 is internalized upon antibody binding, an ideal trait. We made two different ADCs consisting of anti-FcRL5 antibodies 1) conjugated through cysteines to monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) by a maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (MC-vcPAB) linker that is designed to be cleaved by cathepsins (Anti-FcRL5-MC-vcPAB-MMAE); and 2) conjugated via lysines to the maytansinoid DM4 through a disulified linker designed to be cleaved by reducing conditions (anti-FcRL5-SPDB-DM4). These ADCs were tested for cell killing in vitro and in xenograft studies using OPM2 cells stably expressing FcRL5. While unconjugated anti-FcRH5 and control ADCs were not effective, anti-FcRL5-MC-vcPAB-MMAE and anti-FcRL5-SPDB-DM4 were effective at killing this MM cell line both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the anti-FcRL5-SPDB-DM4 conjugate was effective in a SCID-rabbit bone model of MM using the LD cell line. These data suggest that FcRL5 ADCs could be an effective treatment for MM.
