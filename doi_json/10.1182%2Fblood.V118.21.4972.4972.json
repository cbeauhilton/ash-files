    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4972 Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that frequently presents with advanced stage disease. The addition of rituximab, a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, to high dose chemotherapy regimens often followed by stem cell transplant has improved outcomes, but survival still remains low at 3\u20135 years. Novel agents are needed to improve outcomes in MCL. Ofatumumab is a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody directed against a novel epitope on the CD20 antigen. Ofatumumab has been shown to be more potent than rituximab against B-NHL cells in pre-clinical investigations. Ofatumumab is FDA approved for the treatment of CLL that is fludarabine and alemtuzumab refractory or with bulky disease resistant to fludarabine and is being investigated in clinical trials in NHL. In order to characterize the activity of ofatumumab against MCL, we performed pre-clinical investigations into the activity of ofatumumab against MCL cell lines and primary MCL tumor cells derived from patient tumor samples (n=2). Antibody-dependant cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assays were performed in the MCL cell lines Mino, Jeko, Rec-1 and Z-138 to demonstrate sensitivity to rituximab and ofatumumab. Lymphoma cells were labeled with 51 Cr prior to incubation with rituximab or ofatumumab at 10ug/mL plus human serum or effector cells (efector:target ratio of 20:1). 51 Cr-release was measured and the percentage of lysis was calculated. Patient tumor cells were isolated from tumor biopsy samples by MACS sorting (negative selection). Patient tumor cells were incubated with ofatumumab or rituximab at 10ug/mL in the presence of human serum as a complement source. Cell viability was determined at 48 hours by CellTiterGlo assay. Means were compared using a t-test. Expression of CD20 and the complement inhibitory proteins (CIPs) CD55 and CD59 in MCL cell lines were determined by flow cytometry and compared to the rituximab-sensitive cell line Raji and the rituximab-resistant cell line Raji 4RH. Surface density of CD20, CD55 and CD59 were determined by Imagestream analysis. Western blot was performed to measure total CD20 protein expression. Ofatumumab induced significantly higher levels of cell lysis compared to rituximab in CDC assays of all MCL cell lines tested (Mino: 65.9% vs 0.5%; JeKo 43.9% vs 13.3%; REC-1 25.4% vs 4.7%; Z-138: 56.4% vs 0.65%; all p-values <0.05). The ADCC assays showed a similar degree of lysis with ofatumumab when compared to rituximab in all cell lines tested. In primary tumor cells, ofatumumab and rituximab demonstrated similar levels of decreased cell viability following 48 hours of antibody exposure. MCL cell lines demonstrated similar expression of surface and total CD20 when compared to the rituximab-sensitive B-NHL Raji cell line. CIP expression was increased in all MCL cell lines compared to Raji cells and was similar to the rituximab-resistant Raji 4RH cell line. Our data suggest ofatumumab is more potent than rituximab against MCL cells in vitro and retains CDC activity despite high expression levels of CIPs. This increased activity was not seen in patient tumor samples; however we were limited by the number of available patient samples. In vivo experiments investigating the activity of ofatumumab in a SCID mouse MCL xenograft model and investigations into the activity of ofatumumab in MCL cells in combination with cytotoxic agents and novel small molecule inhibitors are ongoing.
