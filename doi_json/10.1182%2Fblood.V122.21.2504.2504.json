    "abstract_text": "Introduction Homeobox (HOX) genes encode transcription factors crucial in embryogenesis. They are often dysregulated in malignancies including leukemias. The aberrant HOX gene expression and its regulation in leukemic cells is neither completely described nor understood. Aims Our main aim was to determine whether the leukemic HOX gene expression pattern is driven by differentiation stage of hematopoietic cells or determined de novo during the process of malignant transformation. Consequentially, we aimed to study the role epigenetic modifiers in regulation of HOX gene expression in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Methods The expression pattern of HOX genes (cluster of HOX A and B) and epigenetic modifiers (DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b, EZH2, BMI-1, MLL, JMJD3, UTX) was assessed by qPCR in 8 FACS-sorted subpopulations of healthy BM representing stages of myeloid differentiation (each sample representing a pool of cells sorted from five individuals). The leukemic expression pattern of these genes was analyzed in diagnostic BM samples of childhood AML patients with typical genotypic and morphological (FAB classification) characteristics (N=46). In vitro experiments were performed using NB4 cell line. Results As expected HOX genes were gradually downregulated during normal differentiation of granulocytic and monocytic lineages (assessed in four consecutive differentiation stages for each lineage). In AML samples, HOX gene expression patterns differed significantly among morphological subtypes. However, HOX gene expression did not correlate among subtypes of AML and their physiologically differentiated counterparts. Interestingly, unsupervised hierarchical clustering (HCA) divided AML patients into four main clusters characterized by the presence of prevalent gene rearrangement (PML-RARa, AML1-ETO, MLL rearrangements and NK-AML). The presence of PML/RARa rearrangement was strongly associated with the lowest expression of both HOXA and HOXB clusters, while the other groups had more variable expression of HOX genes. Moreover, the effect of genetic aberrations on HOX gene expression was clearly apparent within AML M2 and M4 subtypes, where AML1/ETO+ or CBFb/MYH11+ patients had significantly lower expression of HOX genes compared to patients with the same FAB classification but without the rearrangements. The expression pattern of epigenetic modifiers in sorted subpopulations of healthy BM followed their expected role in transcriptional regulation during differentiation. However, there was no relation of this pattern to HOX gene expression. On the contrary, in AML samples, the expression levels of epigenetic modifiers clearly correlated with expression profile of HOX genes. These results were supported by unsupervised HCA based on the expression of epigenetic modifiers that showed upregulation of histon demethylases JMJD3 and UTX together with downregulation of DNMT3b in concordance with high levels of HOX genes. Negative correlation between JMJD3 and DNMT3b expression was observed in all leukemic samples (p=0.03); most apparently in PML/RARa+ patients. Therefore we further studied the impact of genetic aberrations on the epigenetic regulation of HOX gene expression in vitro with PML-RARa+ cell line. Treatment of NB4 cells with ATRA (8, 24hours, 1uM, 10uM) increased the levels of particular HOX genes (HOXA5, A7, B4, B7; FCA=2.8; 1.7; 4; 4 respectively) as well as JMJD3 (FCA=3) and UTX (FCA=1.6). Concordantly, the expression of DNMT3b (FCA=5) was downregulated. The hypothetical driving effect of PML-RARa on de novo determination of leukemic HOX gene expression is further supported by our Results. PML-RARa+ patients had the lowest HOX gene expression regardless of their FLT3/ITD status \u2013 previously shown to upregulate strongly HOX genes expression. Conclusion We conclude that the leukemic expression pattern of HOX genes does not reflect the differentiation stages of malignant cells. Our data also demonstrate different contribution of epigenetic modifiers to the HOX gene expression in healthy and malignant hematopoiesis. Moreover, HCA and expression data together with the results of in vitro experiments suggest that the specific molecular aberrations (as exemplified by PML-RARa) participate in regulation of leukemic HOX gene expression through epigenetic changes.
