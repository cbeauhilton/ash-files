    "abstract_text": "Background Ixazomib, the first oral proteasome inhibitor, is approved in combination with lenalidomide-dexamethasone (Rd) for pts with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy. Approval was based on the phase 3 TOURMALINE-MM1 study (NCT01564537), in which ixazomib showed a consistent progression-free survival (PFS) benefit in combination with Rd (IRd) in the ITT population as well as in prespecified subgroups including pts with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities [del17, t(4;14), t(14;16), +1q], and who received \u22652 prior therapies. An exploratory objective was to evaluate potential relationships between treatment outcomes, tumor gene expression patterns, and mutational status. The NF-\u03baB pathway has been implicated in the development of several malignant disorders. In MM, pro-survival signals from the stromal microenvironment lead to activation of the canonical and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway; ~17% of MM tumors have mutations in key genes regulating the non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway, which is thought to decrease dependence of the MM cell on the stromal microenvironment, a potential mechanism of chemoresistance. Prior data have shown clinical benefit of bortezomib in tumors with non-canonical pathway activation. We utilized gene expression profiles and mutation data to identify tumors with non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway activation and analyzed its impact on PFS in RRMM pts treated with IRd or placebo-Rd. Methods Cytogenetic analyses (FISH), DNA-Seq (hybridization-based targeted MM-specific mutation panel; >400x target mean coverage per sample on ~1200 genes), and RNA-Seq (whole transcriptome sequencing with 50 x 10 6 total paired reads per sample; 100 bp read length) of CD138+ cells were performed on bone marrow aspirates collected at screening. Presence of mutations in key pathway genes and decreased TRAF3 expression were used as surrogates for non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway activation. Results In the ITT population, DNA-Seq data were available for 46% (339/722) and RNA-Seq data for 58% (419/722) of pts. 14.5% (49/339) of pts had mutations in TRAF2, TRAF3, and BIRC2/BIRC3 genes, which are known negative regulators of NIK, a key intermediate of the non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway. Impact of these mutations on PFS was analyzed across the treatment arms. An increased magnitude of benefit was observed in pts with mutations when treated with IRd vs Rd (HR=0.23, 95% CI 0.088\u22120.58, p=0.00086; HR=0.8, 95% CI 0.54\u22121.2, p=0.29 for wildtype). Low TRAF3 expression was previously shown to be associated with increased non-canonical NF-\u03baB activity and could be due to loss-of-function mutations, chromosomal deletions, and/or epigenetic silencing. In TOURMALINE-MM1, correlation of TRAF3 expression (dichotomized based on the global median) with PFS showed a larger magnitude of clinical benefit following IRd treatment vs placebo-Rd in pts with low TRAF3 expression (HR=0.47, 95% CI 0.3\u22120.73, p=0.0006; HR=0.75, 95% CI 0.47\u22121.2, p=0.21 for TRAF3 high). Interestingly, while the median PFS for IRd was similar between pts with high and low TRAF3 expression (HR=0.88, 95% CI 0.54\u22121.4), a difference was observed in pts treated with placebo-Rd, in whom the median PFS for patients with low TRAF3 expression was 9 months shorter vs pts with high TRAF3 expression (HR=0.54, 95% CI 0.36\u22120.81). Also, decreased expression of TRAF3 was observed in pts harboring t(4;14) and +1q abnormalities as well as in pts with \u22652 prior therapies, suggesting increased activation of the non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway in these pt subgroups. This observation would in part explain the larger magnitude of benefit with IRd observed in pts with high-risk cytogenetics and \u22652 prior therapies in the TOURMALINE-MM1 study. Conclusions Addition of ixazomib to Rd backbone therapy has shown a benefit in RRMM subgroups. Our data suggest that IRd provides a larger magnitude of benefit in pts with tumors harboring a constitutively activated non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway. Using a much larger dataset, we confirm the previous observation of bortezomib activity in this molecularly defined population. Though deletions of NF-\u03baB modulators are known to be associated with t(4;14) MM, this is the first instance in which increased activation of the non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway has been shown in MM tumors harboring +1q21. The correlation between +1q21 and increased non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway activity and its prognostic implication in MM will be discussed. Figure. View large Download slide Figure.
