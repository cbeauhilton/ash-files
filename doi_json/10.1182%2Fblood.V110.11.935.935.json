    "abstract_text": "Introduction: DIC is a complication that occurs during serious infection with Gram-negative bacteria. Endotoxin is a component of the bacterial cell wall that elicits a cytokine-mediated cascade of tissue factor-dependent hypercoagulable reactions. The resulting hypercoagulable state may be inhibited by potent anticoagulation. Rivaroxaban is an oral, direct Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor in advanced clinical development for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of rivaroxaban in a rat model of endotoxin-induced DIC. Methods: Rivaroxaban (0.1\u201310 mg/kg p.o.) or vehicle control (PEG400/H 2 O 60/40%, 5 mL/kg p.o.) were administered 30 minutes before endotoxin injection (lipopolysaccharide O55 B5 [LPS], 250 \u03bcg/kg i.v.) to conscious rats. Blood samples were withdrawn from anesthetized animals by heart puncture 4 hours after LPS injection and fibrinogen, platelet count, thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex levels and IL-6 were measured. Results: The induction of DIC was indicated in the placebo + LPS group vs vehicle control by decreased fibrinogen (2.12\u00b10.08 vs 2.69\u00b10.10 g/L) and platelet count (571\u00b128 vs 904\u00b130\u00d710 9 /L) an increase in TAT (75\u00b19 vs 2\u00b11 \u03bcg/L) and IL-6 (8.6\u00b11.23 \u03bcg/L vs 0.028\u00b10.020 \u03bcg/L). Pretreatment with rivaroxaban (0.1\u201310 mg/kg p.o.) dose-dependently ameliorated the effects of LPS on fibrinogen, platelets and TAT. Rivaroxaban 10 mg/kg p.o. normalized fibrinogen (2.58\u00b10.07 g/L) and TAT (5.6\u00b11.2 \u03bcg/L) and increased platelet count (703\u00b119\u00d710 9 /L) (Table). Rivaroxaban also slightly reduced the plasma levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) (4.24\u00b10.67 \u03bcg/L). Conclusions: These results show that direct, selective inhibition of FXa by rivaroxaban effectively normalized the hypercoagulable reactions of endotoxemia with a slight modulating effect on the generation of pro-inflammatory active cytokines, such as IL-6, in the rat DIC model. Further research into the use of rivaroxaban in the management of DIC is therefore warranted. Effects of rivaroxaban in an endotoxin-induced DIC model in rats 4 hours after LPS injection.
