    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1929 A combination of chemotherapy plus G-CSF (chemomobilization) is commonly used to mobilize CD34 + cells to circulation. Mobilization of CD34 + cells is poor or suboptimal in 20\u201330 % of patients. Plerixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist, increases the mobilization of CD34 + cells and may also have effect on graft composition subsequently collected. There are no data on lymphocyte subsets in the grafts collected after chemomobilization plus pre-emptively given plerixafor. We have analyzed lymphocyte subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8, NK cells, CD19) in grafts collected on the next morning after plerixafor injection in 13 chemomobilized patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. As controls we had the first collections from 13 NHL patients mobilized with chemotherapy plus G-CSF and with yield of 2\u20136 \u00d7 10 6 /kg CD34 + cells with 1\u20132 aphaereses. The median CD34 + content of the analyzed grafts was 1.45 \u00d7 10 6 /kg in the plerixafor group compared to 1.8 \u00d7 10 6 /kg in the controls (p=n.s.). The number of T-cell subsets and NK cells were significantly higher in plerixafor mobilized grafts ( Table 1 ). CD19 + B cells were infrequent in both groups. Table 1.

View Large All except one patient has received high-dose therapy with blood stem cell support. The median CD34 + cell dose was 3.1 \u00d7 10 6 /kg in plerixafor treated group and 3.3 \u00d7 10 6 /kg in the control group, respectively. Time to neutrophil engraftment was comparable between the groups. There were two patients in the plerixafor group with late platelet engraftment (1 and 6 months). Addition of plerixafor to chemomobilization in poor mobilizers results in increased content of T lymphocytes and NK cells in the graft but do not appear to mobilize B lymphocytes. Whether higher T cell and NK cell content are associated with more rapid immune reconstitution and survival should be evaluated in larger patient series with longer follow-up.
