    "abstract_text": "Introduction Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is associated with a considerable risk for morbidity and recurrence and related hospitalizations. In the Apixaban after the Initial Management of Pulmonary Embolism and Deep Vein Thrombosis with First-Line Therapy-Extended Treatment (AMPLIFY-EXT) trial, a double-blind placebo-controlled trial with 12 months of treatment, two doses of apixaban (2.5 mg and 5 mg, twice daily) versus placebo significantly reduced symptomatic recurrent VTE or all-cause death without increasing the rate of major bleeding among 2,482 VTE patients who had completed 6-12 months of anticoagulation therapy. In this study, the effects of apixaban therapy versus placebo on medical hospitalization during AMPLIFY-EXT trial were evaluated. Methods A total of 2,477 patients who received study drugs were included in the analysis. All-cause hospitalizations during the trial were captured by dedicated case report forms. Outcomes of interest were; rate of hospitalizations and time from randomization to the first hospitalization. Patients were censored at either death, loss to follow-up, or end of study, whichever came first. Effects of treatment with apixaban versus placebo on the rates of hospitalization were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results During a mean follow-up of 12.3 months, 138 patients were hospitalized at least once, 62 (7.5%/year) in the placebo group (n=826), 42 (4.8%/year) in the apixaban 2.5 mg group (n=840), and 34 (4.0%/year) in the apixaban 5 mg group (n=811). Compared with placebo, apixaban 2.5 mg [hazard ratio (HR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44\u20130.96; p=0.030] and 5 mg (HR 0.54, 95%CI 0.36\u20130.83, p=0.004) were both associated with significant reduction in hospitalization. There was no significant difference in hospitalizations between the 2 doses of apixaban (5 mg vs. 2.5 mg: HR 0.84, 95%CI 0.53\u20131.32, p=0 .445). The mean time to first hospitalization was 153.7 days in the placebo group, 196.9 days in the apixaban 2.5 mg group, and 202.4 days in the apixaban 5 mg group ( Figure ).
