    "abstract_text": "Abstract 935 Introduction: Patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) who are refractory to rituximab-based therapy have a need for new non-cytotoxic treatment options. Ofatumumab targets a unique small-loop epitope on CD20 and elicits rapid and efficient in vitro cell lysis via complement-dependent cytotoxicity, even in rituximab-resistant B cells that express high levels of complement inhibitory proteins. Ofatumumab as single agent showed activity in relapsed/refractory FL, including in some patients previously exposed to rituximab (Hagenbeek et al, Blood 2008). Here we report preliminary results from an international, single-arm trial assessing ofatumumab monotherapy in patients with rituximab-refractory FL. Methods: Eligible patients (aged \u226518 years), with Grade 1 or 2 CD20 + FL considered refractory to rituximab alone or in combination with chemotherapy, were enrolled between Sept 2006 and Sept 2008 (N=116). Refractoriness to rituximab (at least 4 doses) was defined as failure to achieve at least a partial response, disease progression during rituximab treatment, or disease progression following a response within 6 months of last treatment with rituximab-containing regimens. Patients received 8 weekly infusions of ofatumumab (Dose 1, 300 mg; Doses 2\u20138, 500 or 1000 mg); glucocorticoid premedication was required before infusions 1 and 2, and acetaminophen and antihistamine were administered before every infusion. The primary endpoint was objective response (International Working Group criteria) in the 1000 mg dose group over 6 months from the start of treatment, as assessed by an Independent Endpoint Review Committee. Secondary endpoints included duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS) and adverse events (AEs). Results: Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics; 90% of patients received all 8 ofatumumab doses. The median follow-up time on the study was 4.7 months overall and 5.5 months for the 1000 mg group. The overall response rate (ORR) in the 1000 mg group was 10% (95% CI: 4, 17%), including 1 complete response. Stable disease was observed in 50% of patients. In the 1000 mg group, the median duration of response was 6.0 months (95% CI: 2.8, upper limit not estimable) and median PFS was 6.0 months (95% CI: 4.9, 9.1). The ORR in the total population was 11% (95% CI: 5, 17%). Among patients who were refractory to prior rituximab monotherapy (n=27), the ORR was 22% (95% CI: 7, 38%). The ORR among patients who were refractory to rituximab maintenance therapy (n=44) and rituximab combined with chemotherapy (n=45) was 9% (95% CI: 1, 18%) and 7% (95% CI: 0, 14%), respectively. During treatment and up to 30 days following the last dose, the most common AEs (>10% of patients) included rash (15%), urticaria (14%), fatigue (14%), pruritis (13%), nausea (12%), pyrexia (11%) and cough (11%); grade 3\u20134 infusion-related reactions occurred in only 3 patients (all grade 3 events), none of which were considered serious events; grade 3\u20134 hematologic AEs included neutropenia in 5% of patients, anemia in 3% and thrombocytopenia in 1%; grade 3 infections (sepsis, febrile neutropenia) occurred in 2 patients. Conclusions: The majority of patients with rituximab-refractory FL in this study were heavily pretreated, were also refractory to chemotherapy and had high-risk FLIPI scores. Although response rates were low with single-agent ofatumumab in patients refractory to rituximab-chemotherapy, a higher response rate was observed in patients who were refractory to rituximab monotherapy, indicating activity despite being refractory to single-agent rituximab. Ofatumumab was well tolerated in this heavily-pretreated population. Infusion reactions were manageable and no unexpected toxicities were observed. Further investigations with ofatumumab are warranted, including in combination with other therapies in patients with FL. Table 1. Baseline characteristics  . 500 mg (n=30) . 1000 mg (n=86) .
