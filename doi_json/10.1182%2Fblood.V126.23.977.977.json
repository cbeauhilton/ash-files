    "abstract_text": "Airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) affects 55-77% of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) and occurs even in the absence of asthma. While asthma increases SCD morbidity and mortality, the underlying mechanisms of this highly prevalent AHR in a hemoglobinopathy remain unknown. We hypothesized that Placenta Growth Factor (PlGF), an erythroblast-secreted factor that is elevated in SCD, mediates this AHR. We studied AHR in allergen-exposed PlGF -/- and SCD mice. Sickle mice genetically deficient in PlGF were not viable. PlGF augmented AHR, lung inflammation and blood/lung eosinophilia via IL-13 (a Th2-cytokine) and increased 5-lipoxygenase (a leukotriene synthetic enzyme) expression. AHR, or pulmonary inflammation and leukotriene levels were blunted in PlGF -/- mice or in PlGF WT mice treated with anti-PlGF-Ab, and was rescued by intratracheal administration of leukotrienes to PlGF -/- mice. Notably, Th2-mediated Stat-6 activation further increased PlGF expression from lung epithelium, eosinophils and macrophages, linking the PlGF-leukotriene pathway in a positive feedback loop. Th2 response is classically seen in asthma, and indeed, expression of PlGF and its downstream genes was increased in respiratory epithelial cells of asthma patients. Like patients with SCD, sickle hematopoietic chimeras developed increased AHR and had higher leukotriene levels; and both were abrogated by anti-PlGF-Ab or zileuton (5-lipoxygenase inhibitor) phenocopying the blunted AHR in PlGF -/- mice, and indicating that sickle erythroid-cells/RBC potentiate AHR. Overall, PlGF exacerbates AHR and uniquely links the leukotriene and Th2 pathways in asthma. Both zileuton, licensed for asthma and anti-PlGF-Ab, in clinical trials for cancer, could be promising therapies to reduce the pulmonary morbidity in SCD.
