    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Eltrombopag (PROMACTA \u00ae /REVOLADE \u00ae ; GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA) is the first oral small molecule, non-peptide thrombopoietin receptor agonist shown to increase platelets and reduce bleeding symptoms during placebo-controlled trials in chronic ITP patients. EXTEND is an ongoing, open-label study designed to assess the long-term safety and clinical benefit of eltrombopag in patients with chronic ITP. While eltrombopag has been shown to raise platelet counts above the recognized goal of \u226550,000/\u03bcL in the majority of patients, it unknown whether patients who do not achieve this level of elevation derive other clinical benefit from eltrombopag therapy. METHODS: For this analysis, patients who were enrolled in EXTEND for at least 6 weeks were evaluated to determine what percentage achieved platelet counts \u226550,000/\u03bcL from baseline platelet counts \u226430,000/\u03bcL. Furthermore, clinical benefit, in terms of doubled platelet counts, reduced bleeding symptoms, or reduced concomitant ITP medication use, was evaluated in the subgroup of patients who did not achieve platelet counts \u226550,000/\u03bcL during the study. Bleeding symptoms were prospectively evaluated using the WHO Bleeding Scale: Grade 0 = no bleeding, Grade 1 = mild bleeding, Grade 2 = moderate bleeding, Grade 3 = gross bleeding, and Grade 4 = debilitating blood loss. RESULTS: Of the 117 patients with baseline platelet counts \u226430,000/\u03bcL evaluated, 91 patients (78%) achieved platelet counts \u226550,000/\u03bcL at least once during the study; whereas, 26 patients (22%) did not achieve platelet counts \u226550,000/\u03bcL. The majority of patients not achieving platelet counts \u226550,000/\u03bcL had baseline platelet counts \u226415,000/\u03bcL (96%, n = 24/26); however, 69% of all patients with baseline platelet counts \u226415,000/\u03bcL on study for at least 6 weeks achieved platelet counts \u226550,000/\u03bcL. The majority of patients not achieving platelet counts \u226550,000/\u03bcL during the study doubled their platelet count from baseline at least once (62%, n = 16/26). Among patients whose platelet counts doubled, the median baseline platelet count was 4,000/\u03bcL, compared to the median maximum platelet count of 29,000/\u03bcL achieved during treatment with eltrombopag. Nineteen of the 26 patients not achieving platelet counts \u226550,000/\u03bcL had bleeding symptoms at baseline (WHO Grades 1\u20134). The majority of the 19 patients with bleeding symptoms at baseline reduced their bleeding symptoms during treatment with eltrombopag (68%, n = 13/19). Eleven of the 26 patients not achieving platelet counts \u226550,000/\u03bcL were receiving concomitant ITP medications at baseline. Five of the 11 (45%) were able to reduce or discontinue at least 1 baseline concomitant ITP medication while receiving eltrombopag. A total of 24 of the 26 patients (92%) not achieving platelet counts \u226550,000/\u03bcL during the study derived clinical benefit (doubling of platelet count, reduction in bleeding, and/or reduction in use of concomitant ITP medications) following treatment with eltrombopag. CONCLUSION: Approximately 80% of evaluated patients with baseline platelet counts \u226430,000/\u03bcL achieved platelet counts \u226550,000/\u03bcL during the study. In the subgroup of patients who did not achieve platelet counts \u226550,000/\u03bcL, clinical benefit was achieved by 92% of patients and consisted of doubled platelet counts, reduced bleeding symptoms, and/or reduced concomitant medication use.",
