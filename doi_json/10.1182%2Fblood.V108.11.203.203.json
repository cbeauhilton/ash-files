    "abstract_text": "There is increasing evidence that insertional activation of proto-oncogenes by retroviral vectors is a significant safety issue that must be addressed before clinical gene therapy, particularly targeting hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, can be further developed. The risk of insertional mutagenesis for replication-incompetent retroviral vectors has been assumed to be low until the occurence of T cell leukemias in children treated with HSC-directed gene therapy for X-SCID, and recent evidence that retroviral integration is more common in the promoter region of transcriptionally-active genes. The occurence of \u201ccommon integration sites\u201d in a particular gene also suggests a non-random insertion pattern, and/or immortalization or other change in the behavior of a clone harboring an insertion in these particular genes. We have previously reported a highly non-random occurence of 14 unique vector integrations in the first two introns of the MDS1/EVI1 proto-oncogene out of a total of 702 identified from myeloid cells of 9 rhesus macaques at least 6 months post-transplantion of retrovirally-transduced CD34+ cells.(Calmels et al, 2005). This same gene locus was found frequently activated by insertions in murine bone marrow cells immortalized in long-term in vitro culture after transduction with retroviral vectors.(Du et al Blood, 2005) To begin to investigate the factors contributing to this worrisome finding, particularly given the very recent report of a marked over-representation of MDS1/EVI1 insertions in a human clinical gene therapy trial for chronic granulomatous disease, we asked whether continued ex vivo expansion of transduced CD34+ cells prior to transplantation would further select for clones with insertions in MDS1/EVI1 or other proto-oncogenes. Rhesus CD34+ cells were transduced with the G1Na standard retroviral vector, identical to that used in the prior studies, using our standard 96 hour transduction protocol in the presence of Retronectin and SCF, FLT3L and thrombopoietin. At the end of transduction, all cells were continued in culture for an additional 7 days under the same culture conditions, and then reinfused into the donor animal following 1200 rads TBI. At 1 month post-transplant there were no CIS and no MDS1/EVI1 insertions identified. However, at 6 months post-transplantation 5 out of 27 (19%) of the unique insertions identified in granulocytes were within the first two introns of MDS1/EVI1, very significantly higher than the 2% of MDS1/EVI1 insertions (14 of 702) identified in animals that were transplanted with cells not subjected to additional ex vivo expansion.(p<.0001) One MDS1/EVI1 clone constituted 14% of overall sequences identified, and the 5 clones constituted 37% of total sequences identified. This strongly suggests that the over-representation of this locus in engrafting cells is due to a potent immortalizing signal provided by activation of the MDS1/EVI1 gene products by the stonger retroviral promoter/enhancer, and that the need for extended ex vivo culture of target cells may select for insertion events activating this locus. It also suggests that strategies involving prolonged ex vivo expansion or selection of transduced cells could increase the risk of gene therapy utilizing integrating vectors targeting primitive hematopoietic cells."
