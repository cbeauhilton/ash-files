    "abstract_text": "Rearrangements involving the MLL gene locus at chromosome band 11q23 are observed in therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes following treatment with topoisomerase II (topoII) inhibitors including etoposide. We have shown that one hour of etoposide exposure (20\u201350 \u03bcM) stimulates stable MLL rearrangements in primary human CD34+ cells and that the spectrum of repair products within MLL gene is broader than so far described (Libura et al , Blood , 2005). Clinical data suggest that MLL -associated malignant leukemias originate within primitive hematopietic stem cells capable of differentiation into all hematopoietic lineages and repopulation of myelo-ablated hosts. These cells can be analyzed using the in vivo NOD-SCID mouse model as well as the in vitro long-term culture initiating cell (LTC-IC) assay. We adopted our in vitro CD34+ cell culture model to investigate the impact of etoposide exposure on the most primitive hematopoietic stem cells using parallel assays for LTC-IC and NOD-SCID Repopulating Cells (SRC). Following etoposide exposure (20\u201350 \u03bcM for 1 hour), and 48\u201396 hours recovery in vitro , untreated control and etoposide-treated CD34+ cells were either seeded in LTC-IC with a supportive feeder layer (Stem Cell Technologies, Inc.), or injected into NOD-SCID mice (0.1\u20131.5x10 6 cells per mouse). After 12 weeks, both LTC-IC cultures and bone marrow cells from NOD-SCID mice were seeded in methylcellulose media supplemented with growth factors that promote only human cell colony formation. An increased number of colonies in etoposide-treated samples was obtained from LTC-IC cultures in 3 out of 5 experiments (p value<0.05). This increase in colony number was more dramatic in etoposide-treated samples from NOD-SCID bone marrow (57 versus 0, 8 versus 0). These data demonstrate that etoposide exposure can significantly alter the potential of early hematopoietic stem cells to survive and proliferate both in vitro and in vivo . Injection of as few as 3x10 5 CD34+ cells into a NOD-SCID mouse was sufficient to obtain methylcellulose colonies, suggesting that this method can be used for the analysis of cells obtained from a single patient sample. Mutation analysis of human methylcellulose colonies derived from both LTC-IC and NOD-SCID was performed by inverse PCR and ligation-mediated PCR followed by sequencing. This analysis revealed that rearrangements originating within the MLL breakpoint cluster region (bcr) were present in 12 out of 29 colonies from etoposide-treated samples versus 5 out of 39 colonies from control samples (p value <0.01), demonstrating that etoposide exposure promotes stable rearrangements within a hematopoietic stem cell compartment with significant proliferative potential. Eight of the 17 events were sequenced, and showed 6 MLL tandem duplications within intron 8, one complex translocation between MLL and chr.15 and tandem duplication, and one event with foreign sequence of unknown origin. Our data are the first report of the spectrum and frequency of MLL rearrangements following topo II inhibitor exposure in a cell population thought to be the target for recombinogenic events leading to therapy-related leukemias.",
