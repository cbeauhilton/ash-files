    "abstract_text": "Introduction T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a rare mature T-Cell malignancy typically associated with aggressive clinical course. Leukemic T-cells demonstrate post-thymic T-cell phenotypes (Tdt-, CD1a-, CD5+, CD2+ and CD7+) and commonly are CD4+/CD8- T-cells, but co-expression of CD4+/CD8+ or CD8+/CD4- have also been observed. Rearrangement of chromosome 14 involving TCL1 locus is the cornerstone for T-PLL diagnosis which leads to overexpression of oncogene TCL1. As a binding partner for TCL1, AKT expression correlates with worse prognosis. Despite advances in identification of novel mutations, therapeutic option is limited with most patients having very short survival. Herein, we performed a detailed analysis of specific T-cell subsets affected in T-PLL and a comprehensive genomic analysis by whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing. We also explored the preclinical efficacy of targeting AKT activation by AKT inhibitor MK2206 on leukemic T-cells isolated from T-PLL patients. Methods T-PLL leukemic cells were isolated from blood or marrow samples of T-PLL patients (n=9) and were tested for involved T-cell subsets by multicolor flow cytometric analysis. Leukemic T-cells were treated with escalating doses of MK2206 (0 to 10 \u00b5M) for about 80 hours and were assessed for their apoptosis levels using Annexin V flow cytometric analysis. Whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing were conducted using genomic DNA and RNA isolated from purified leukemic T cells from T-PLL patients. Results Phenotypic analysis of T-cell subsets in T-PLL patients showed that leukemic T-cells in 4 untreated T-PLL patients are consistent with na\u00efve T-cell phenotype (CD45RA+, CD45RO-, CCR7+). Leukemic T-cells in 3 of the untreated patients and in 2 of the treated patients have central memory T (CD45RA-, CD45RO+, CCR7+) and effector memory T phenotypes (CD45RA-, CD45RO+,CCR7-) respectively. MK2206 treatment was able to induce dose-dependent apoptosis on the isolated PBMC (containing > 90% leukemic T-cells) of T-PLL patients (n=4) (IC50: 5 \u00b5M). FISH analysis found a rearrangement of TCL1 locus on chromosome 14 in all T-PLL cases (n=9). Three cases have also been detected to have del (11q) involving ATM locus and one patient has both del(11q) and del(17p). Subsequent WES (n=7) and RNA sequencing (n=6) analysis revealed recently reported mutations in ATM (frame shift mutation and early stop mutation W579*) in 2 cases, JAK3 (M511I) in 2 cases and STAT5B (T628S and N642H) in 2 cases. Importantly, novel somatic mutations in gene IKZF1 (N159S), NTRK1 (R33W), AP2A2 (P514L), HDAC8 (I115R), RARB (G90W) and TNIP2 (K104Q) were detected by WES. Mutations in EML4 (L548W and F304S) and VAV3 (C282Y and splice site mutation) were also identified in 2 different T-PLL cases. RNA sequencing revealed several fusion transcripts resulting in early stop of several different genes including PTPRT , L3MBTL1 , UCKL1 in one T-PLL case. Conclusion T-PLL leukemic T-cells are consistent with either na\u00efve or central memory T-cell subsets in untreated patients. The AKT inhibitor MK-2206 was capable of inducing apoptosis and could be a potential therapeutic agent for T-PLL patients. In addition, we detected known mutations in ATM and JAK-STAT pathways. Novel mutations in genes involving DNA binding and chromatin remodeling ( IKZF1, HDAC8 ) or kinase signal pathway ( NTRK1, TNIP2, VAV3, EML4 ) were uncovered. These results suggest that further therapeutic approaches could be developed to target DNA binding factors or JAK-STAT or AKT-TCL1 signal pathway with an ultimate goal to improve survival of T-PLL patients. Disclosures Off Label Use: Off label use of MK2206: MK-2206 is an AKT inhibitor obtained from Selleck Chemicals and is used to treat leukemic cells in vitro to test the leukemic sensitivity to AKT inhibition. ."
