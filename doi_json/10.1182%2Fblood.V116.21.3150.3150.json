    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3150 Imatinib resistance is a major problem in treatment of Bcr-Abl positive leukemias, particularly in patients with ALL and advanced CML. One mechanism of this resistance is overexpression of Bcr-Abl. We investigated the effects of Imatinib deprivation in Bcr-Abl overexpressing Imatinib-resistant ALL cell lines. Removal of Imatinib from culture medium led to induction of a non-apoptotic cell death starting approximately 40 hours after Imatinib withdrawal. This cell death was preceded by a rapid and robust induction of Bcr-Abl autophosphorylation and concomitant overstimulation of PI3K-, MAPK-, and JAK/STAT signalling. Over-activation of Bcr-Abl downstream signalling was accompanied by a significant enhanced glucose and amino acid metabolism and an elevated intracellular protein and nucleic acid content. As a result of this enhanced metabolisms we observed a massive increase in cell size, multinucleation, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and reduced intracellular ATP level. The phase-lucent vacuoles did not incorporate the endosome/lysosome tracker, Lyso Tracker Red indicating that the vacuoles were formed by dilation of ER cisternae. To determine if Imatinib deprivation induces an ER stress response concurrent with vacuolization we investigated typical ER stress markers. Upon removal of Imatinib a massive induction of CHOP expression and eIF2 alpha phosphorylation, as well as alternative splicing of XPB could be detected. It has been demonstrated that severe ER stress promotes cell death either by induction of a BIM-dependent apoptitic process or by a TRAF2-RIP1 dependent pathway. Despite of a robust induction of BIM and posttranslational modification of RIP1, siRNA-mediated suppression of BIM and RIP1 had no effect on Imatinib deprivation-induced cell death whereas downmodulation of CHOP partially rescued those cells. Using different small molecule inhibitor libraries, we also identified inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) and p38-MAPK, as well as glucocorticoids as potent compounds which not only completely prevented metabolic stress and induction of cell death upon removal of Imatinib but also partially repressed induction of CHOP upon Imatinib withdrawal. Importantly, in the presence of glucocorticoids, we found a significant enhanced number of cell clones with Bcr-Abl overexpression in lympoid cell lines upon de novo transfection with Bcr-Abl. In conclusion, acute over-activation of the oncogene Bcr-Abl led to metabolic stress and ER stress followed by a delayed induction of a necrosis-like cell death. These cellular responses to Bcr-Abl-mediated oncogenic stress could be completely blocked by glucocorticoids. Therefore, treatment of glucocorticoid resistant ALL may generate selective pressure towards Bcr-Abl overexpession. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
