    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-28 The t11;14 translocation, the genetic hallmark of MCL, drives cyclin D1 expression in the tumor cells and historically facilitated the separation of MCL into a distinct entity. FISH cytogenetics are part of the workup and can be particularly helpful to separate leukemic MCL from CLL. Morphology and clinical course of MCL are heterogeneous and might have suggested the presence of different entities. Gene expression profiling answered this concern and provided several important insights: 1. despite the clinical heterogeneity, MCL has a characteristic gene expression profile supporting the accuracy of current diagnostic methods; 2. cyclin D1 negative MCL has the same diagnostic pathologic and gene expression features as cyclin D1 positive MCL, and 3. a gene expression based measure of tumor proliferation is a potent predictor of outcome and identifies patients with survival probabilities ranging from less than 1 year (highly proliferative tumors) to more than 6 years (low proliferation). 1 Biologically, the gene expression based proliferation score integrates several acquired genetic changes in the tumor that include deletions of the INK4a/ARF locus encoding the tumor suppressors p14 and p16, amplification of BMI1, and secondary changes in the cyclin D1 locus. Mutations and deletions that alter the structure of the 3'UTR can enhance cyclin D1 mRNA stability, 2 and the loss of miR binding sites in this region can enhance protein translation. 3 These changes increase cyclin D1 protein resulting in increased proliferation. Additional genetic lesions such as deletions of ATM and p53 affect DNA damage responses pathways. The high frequency of secondary genetic changes in MCL cells may indicate genomic instability and the presence of additional chromosomal aberrations and certain genetic alterations hold prognostic information. 4 With the continued refinement of whole genome genetic approaches the goal of identifying crucial pathways and possible driver genes in the pathogenesis of MCL may be within reach. MCL characterized by an antiapoptotic phenotype combined with features of aggressive lymphomas remains an incurable disease and having the worst outcome among all B-cell lymphomas. Biologic markers that predict treatment response and that could give way to targeted therapy have remained elusive. Several new drugs could help overcome treatment resistance and new analytic tools when incorporated into clinical trials may help dissect mechanisms of drug action and resistance. Our approach has been to incorporate gene expression profiling into a clinical trial of bortezomib to directly monitor the effects of the treatment on tumor biology in vivo. We identified an integrated stress response to bortezomib in sensitive tumors that may yield clinically usefully predictors of sensitivity and that could guide the development of improved therapies. 1.
