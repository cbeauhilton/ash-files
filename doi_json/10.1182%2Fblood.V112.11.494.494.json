    "abstract_text": "We have successfully generated the first immuno-competent transgenic mouse model of multiple myeloma (MM), Vk*MYC, in which sporadic MYC activation in the germinal center is AID dependent and mediated by the somatic hypermutation process. All of Vk*MYC mice develop monoclonal PC expansion by 50 weeks of age, that is manifested by high levels of serum IgGs and major M-spikes by SPEP. The PCs in Vk*MYC mice are fully differentiated, somatically mutated, have a very low proliferation index and are found exclusively in the BM. Associated with the long lifespan (medium survival = 661d), Vk*MYC mice develop anemia and diffuse bone disease (osteoporosis with low bone mineral density), with sporadic occurrence of lytic bone lesions and hind limb paralysis. The phenotypic fidelity of the Vk*MYC mice translates in a therapeutic fidelity, as Vk*MYC mice show response to known clinically active anti-myeloma drugs (bortezomib, melphalane, dexamethasone), but not to drugs that have shown no clinical activity as single agents (vincristine, hydroxyurea, fludarabine). Furthermore, acquired bortezomib resistance could efficiently be induced in Vk*MYC mice after only four cycles of suboptimal treatment, and studies are in progress to identify genetic events associated with bortezomib resistance. Preliminary aCGH experiments on a high resolution Agilent 244K array, using genomic DNA from six Vk*MYC CD138+ selected PCs, showed that the genomic complexity of Vk*MYC tumors is quite low, with only few unbalanced rearrangements, such as trisomy of chromosome 15 detected in two samples or trisomy 9 present in another tumor. The most common abnormalities found are small focal monoallelic deletions, six of which are present in more than one tumor. A focal homozygous deletion of several exons of a gene was identified in two tumors samples. Remarkably, a comparative analysis of the syntenic chromosomal region in human MM cell lines and primary patient samples identified similar recurrent homozygous deletion in this putative novel tumor suppressor gene. Overall, these data suggest that the genomic complexity in this inbred strain of transgenic mice is significantly less then in patients with MM, simplifying the search for critical loci involved in MM tumorigenesis and drug resistance and further validate the Vk*MYC mice as a particularly faithful model of human MM."
