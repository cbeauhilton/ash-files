    "abstract_text": "Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by impaired stem cell function resulting in pancytopenia. Diagnosis of IBMFS presents a major challenge due to limited diagnostic tests and overlapping phenotypes. For that reason, novel and clinical relevant biomarkers and possible targets are urgently needed. Our study defines NIPA as an IBMFS gene, which is significantly downregulated in a distinct subset of MDS-type refractory cytopenia of childhood patients. Mechanistically, NIPA binds FANCD2 and regulates its nuclear abundance. The stabilization of both non- and monoubiquitinated FANCD2 identifies NIPA as an essential player in the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway. NIPA thereby prevents MMC hypersensitivity visualized by increased numbers of chromosome radials and reduced cell survival after induction of interstrand crosslinks. To provide proof of principle, re-expression of FANCD2 in Nipa deficient cells restores MMC sensitivity. In a knockout mouse model, Nipa deficiency leads to major cell intrinsic long-term repopulation defects of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), with impaired self-renewal in serial transplantations and a bias towards myeloid differentiation. Unresolved DNA damage in Nipa deficient HSCs causes increased sensitivity to cell death and leads to progressive, age-related loss of the HSC pool. Induction of replication stress triggers the phenotypic reduction and functional decline of murine HSCs, resulting in complete bone marrow failure and death of the mice thereby mimicing Fanconi Anemia. Taken together, our study adds NIPA to the short list of FA-associated proteins being essential for a functional DNA repair/FA/BRCA axis and thereby emphasizing its impact as potential diagnostic marker and/or possible target in bone marrow failure syndromes.
