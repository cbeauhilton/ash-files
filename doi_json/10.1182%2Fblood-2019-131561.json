    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a life-threatening complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Despite being the leading cause of death in adult patients with SCD, current recommendations for treatment of ACS remain largely supportive, consisting of pain management, aggressive fluid resuscitation, respiratory support, and transfusion therapy. Despite these measures, it is not uncommon for patients to require intubation due to progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Recently, there have been a number of case reports that have successfully utilized extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for the management of ACS in those patients who fail to respond to conventional therapy [Kuo et al., 2013, Sewaralthahab et al, 2018]. However, the use of ECMO in this patient population remains uncommon, and further evaluation of this intervention is needed. This case report details an unsuccessful attempt at the use of ECMO in the case of ARDS secondary to ACS, in an attempt to identify critical pitfalls. CASE REPORT: A 32-year-old African-American female with HbSS disease on hydroxyurea therapy was transferred from an outside hospital following 3 days of respiratory decompensation. Prior to arrival, patient coded once at the outside hospital and once on transfer. Veno-arterial ECMO was initiated with improving oxygen saturation and volume status with continuous renal replacement therapy. To maintain an ECMO-specific goal hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL, 1:1 manual exchange transfusions were performed due to an inability to access equipment for automated RBC exchange. Once stable enough for CT, patient was found to have gray-white inversion suggestive of irreversible severe brain damage. Following another 28 days of supportive care with no neurologic improvement, the family decided to withdraw care, and the patient expired. CONCLUSION: While unsuccessful, this patient's case revealed a need for defining parameters regarding the initiation of ECMO in SCD patients with severe ACS. A review of previously-published literature has shown that the use of ECMO for the management of ARDS in adults is more efficacious than conventional ventilation support [Peek et al., 2009]. In patients with SCD, this improvement in efficacy is not readily reproduced, likely due to unique challenges presented by the pathophysiology of the disease. Notably, patients with SCD face additional risks of venous thromboembolism and strokes while on prolonged bed rest due to a baseline prothrombotic state [Sewaralthahab et al., 2018]. A systematic review of available case reports is needed to develop a protocol for the management of severe ACS that takes SCD-specific risks into account. The present report also makes a case for the training of providers in the early recognition of severe ACS in SCD patients. SCD remains largely undertreated in the United States, likely due to a complex interplay of patient, physician, and institutional factors. Had this patient been transferred immediately to a facility better equipped to provide a higher level of care, her condition could have arguably taken a different course. Despite the aforementioned challenges, ECMO remains a feasible option for the management of severe ACS in patients with SCD, and efforts should be made to standardize current treatment protocols.
