    "abstract_text": "CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03b1 (C/EBP\u03b1) is a master regulator for myeloid differentiation. As a potential tumor suppressor, its loss of function through mutations and posttranslational mechanisms has been thoroughly investigated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recently, we have demonstrated the importance of epigenetic alterations in deregulating C/EBP\u03b1 expression patterns in lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In this study we investigated the role of DNA methylation and other epigenetic factors in the regulation of C/EBP\u03b1 in AML using 94 patient samples and 7 leukemia cell lines. A comprehensive and quantitative DNA methylation analysis of C/EBP\u03b1\u2019s large CpG island using MassARRAY (Sequenom\u00a9) technology and BioCOBRA identified a distinct and densely methylated upstream promoter region (\u22121423 bp to \u22121121 bp in relation to the transcription start site) in 20% (19 of 94) of AML patient samples and in five of seven leukemia cell lines, while the core promoter remained unmethylated. This aberrant DNA methylation pattern was associated with two generally prognostically favorable cytogenetic subgroups: inv(16)(p13q22) and t(15;17)(q22;q21). While DNA methylation levels in normal bone marrow samples (NBM) were very low (median: 0%, range: 0%\u20135%) when compared to NBM, we observed significantly higher DNA methylation levels in the inv(16) and t(15;17) cytogenetic subgroups, with median DNA methylation levels of 29% (range: 1% to 81%) and 5% (range: 1% to 94%), respectively (p<0.05). However, using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, we could not detect a significant correlation between DNA methylation of C/EBP\u03b1 and its expression in the inv(16) subgroup. Interestingly, while epigenetic-targeting compounds induced up-regulation of C/EBP\u03b1 mRNA in vitro , C/EBP\u03b1 protein was diminished. This unexpected scenario was postulated to be compatible with the presence of a microRNA targeting C/EBP\u03b1 mRNA. Using a computational microRNA prediction approach and functional studies, we show that C/EBP\u03b1 mRNA is a target for microRNA-124a. We additionally demonstrate that microRNA-124a is frequently silenced by epigenetic mechanisms in AML, becomes upregulated following epigenetic treatment and targets the C/EBP\u03b1 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032UTR). In this way, C/EBP\u03b1 protein expression is reduced in a posttranscriptional manner. Our results indicate that epigenetic alterations of C/EBP\u03b1 are a frequent event in AML and that epigenetic treatment can result in down-regulation of a key hematopoietic transcription factor.",
