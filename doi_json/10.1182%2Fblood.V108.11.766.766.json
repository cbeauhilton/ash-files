    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Hemophilia patients with inhibitors experience frequent bleeds and reduced quality of life (QoL). This trial evaluated whether once\u2212daily prophylaxis therapy with activated recombinant factor VII (rFVIIa; 90 or 270 \u03bcg/kg) for 3 months can effectively reduce bleed frequency compared with on\u2212demand therapy, without compromising safety. Methods: Thirty\u2212eight hemophilia inhibitor patients with frequent bleeds entered a 3\u2212month observation period where on\u2212demand therapy was continued according to local practice. Twenty\u2212two patients with a stable bleed frequency (\u22654 bleeds/month) were randomized 1:1 to once\u2212daily dosing with 90 or 270 \u03bcg/kg rFVIIa in a double\u2212blind, parallel\u2212group design. To maintain blinding, the same volume was administered in both groups. Patients then entered a 3\u2212month post\u2212treatment observation period, where on\u2212demand therapy was resumed. Results: The number of bleeds per month was significantly reduced by 45% and 59% with 90 or 270 \u03bcg/kg rFVIIa prophylaxis, respectively, compared with the observation period (Fig.). Similar reductions were seen for all bleeds, irrespective of site or cause. The majority of this reduced bleeding frequency was maintained in the 3 month post\u2212treatment period (27% and 50% reductions, respectively). There were no treatment\u2212 or dose\u2212dependent patterns in the number or type of adverse events. No thromboembolic events or withdrawals due to adverse events or ineffective treatment were reported. The benefits of reducing bleeding frequency in this trial translated into improvements in QoL. Conclusions: These results support the concept of secondary rFVIIa prophylaxis in inhibitor patients with frequent bleeds. Clinically relevant reductions in number of bleeds and improvements in quality of life were observed during prophylaxis compared with conventional on\u2212demand therapy without raising any safety concerns.
