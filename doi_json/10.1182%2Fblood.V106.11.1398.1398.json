    "abstract_text": "We have studied Rac signal transduction in human cord-blood (CB) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) CD34 + cells and determined that Rac proteins are critically involved in the interaction between human stem/progenitor cells and stroma. Constitutive activation of Rac signaling was achieved by retroviral introduction of Rac1-V12 into CB-derived CD34 + cells, while inhibition of Rac signaling was established by retroviral introduction of dominant negative Rac1-N17 or by utilizing the Rac inhibitor NSC23766 . Inhibition of Rac signaling resulted in a proliferative disadvantage of CB-CD34 + cells when cultured on MS5 stromal cells. Cells were severely disturbed in their migration towards and direct association with MS5 stroma when Rac signaling was inhibited. The Long Term Culture-Initiating Cells (LTC-ICs) migrated underneath the stromal MS5 layer within 24 hrs after plating, and similar results were obtained for about 50% of the Colony Forming Cells (CFCs). However, transient inhibition of Rac signaling for 24\u201372 hrs resulted in a shift of LTC-ICs and CFCs to the suspension phase as determined by colony assays and CAFC week 5 enumeration. When Rac signaling signal transduction was inhibited during the 5 week coculture period a dramatic decrease in LTC-IC frequency from 0.6% to 0.15% was observed. Many of these phenotypes were reversed in the presence of activated Rac1-V12, including improved migration towards and association with MS5 cells and elevated LTC-IC frequencies. Importantly, in CAFC assays using AML cells (n=8) that were enriched for leukemic stem cells on the basis of a CD34 + /CD38 low phenotype we observed a dramatic decrease in leukemic CAFC formation as well as strongly diminished clonal expansion in the presence of the Rac inhibitor NSC23766 . Taken together, our data indicate that Rac signal transduction is required for the maintenance and expansion of both normal as well as leukemic stem/progenitor cells by mediating their interaction with stromal cells."
