    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Current practice assumes that just a quantitative reduction in the number of transfused wbcs to <1 to 5 x 10 6 /transfusion is sufficient to prevent plt alloimmunization. However, our studies indicate that different leukoreduction strategies vary in their ability to remove immunizing wbcs, and this correlates with rates of alloimmune plt refractoriness in immunocompetent recipients. Experimental Design And Methods : Pairs of donor-recipient dogs were selected either at random, as having a shared DLA DR-B epitope, or as being specifically mismatched for this DLA locus. Non-leukoreduced or leukoreduced radiochromium-labeled donor plts were transfused weekly for up to 8 weeks or until the onset of plt refractoriness defined as <5% of the donor dog\u2019s plts circulating in the recipient at 24 hours post-transfusion. Three methods of leukoreduction were evaluated: centrifugation leukoreduction (C-LR); filtration leukoreduction (F-LR) with different types of filters; or combined F-LR/C-LR. Flow cytometry was used to identify the types of residual wbcs following leukoreduction. Table 1 gives the number of residual wbcs and the transfusion outcomes based on the leukoreduction strategy used, while Table 2 gives the relative proportion of the types of residual wbcs after leukoreduction compared to the overall results for the leukoreduction method used.
