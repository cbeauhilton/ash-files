    "abstract_text": "Although impressive developments have been made in the treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) patients, the overall survival is still very poor. With the exception of novel therapeutic strategies based on monoclonal antibodies (Bi-specific T-cell engagers, BiTEs) or immunogenic cells (CART cells), the therapeutic approaches for adult ALL patients are still base on non-selective chemotherapy or on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the patients harboring the BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript. In addition a large percentage of initial successfully treated patients frequently develop relapses. Thus there is a need to improve the efficacy of conventional therapies, in particular those related to TKIs and to DNA damaging agents, in order to reduce the off-target toxicity and avoid relapses. In the present study we evaluated the in vitro , ex vivo and in vivo efficacy of MK-1775, a specific Wee1 inhibitor, in single agent and in combination with different therapeutic agents normally used for the treatment of B-/T-ALL. We firstly started by evaluated the efficacy of the compound in single agent on a panel of human B and T ALL cell lines (n=8) and on primary cells isolated from the bone marrow of adult B-ALL patients (n=8). The inhibition of Wee1 deeply reduced the cell viability and the proliferation rate, induced the apoptosis and increased the DNA damages of both leukemic cell lines and primary cells. Further cell-cycle analysis showed that in leukemic cell lines the treatment increased the number of cell in late S and G2/M phase. Light microscopy analyses, looking for nuclei morphology, confirmed that MK-1775 increased the number of mitotic cells but it interfered with normal mitotic division (induction of aberrant mitosis as showed by the increment of DNA bridges and micro-nuclei). The effects of the compound on the cell cycle profile and on the G2/M checkpoint were confirmed also in immunoblotting analyses, by the increment of phospho-HH3(ser10) and of Myt1 (mitotic isoform), and by gene expression analysis looking to specific genes involved in the G2/M checkpoints (PrimePcr DNA damage assay, Biorad). In particular genes like GADD45A and CCNB1/CCNB2 were significantly up-regulated between treated and untreated samples. Finally using a T-ALL mouse model we evaluated the effect of MK-1775 in single agent. Although no significative differences were seen between treated and un-treated samples, due to a very aggressive phenotype of the disease (all animal died after only 18 days from the engraftment), molecular analyses confirmed that the treatment induced DNA damages (increase of H2A.X and p-Chk1 ser317) and inhibited Wee1 functionality (reduction of pCDC2) on leukemic blasts isolated from both spleens and bone marrows. To evaluate if the inhibition of the G2/M checkpoint could sensitize leukemic cells to the toxicity of antineoplastic drugs, Philadelphia-negative ALL cell lines and primary leukemic cells (n=9) where treated with increasing concentration of MK-1775 and increasing concentration of the nucleotide analogue, clofarabine. Statistical analyses (Combination index value) confirmed the synergy of the combination in the reduction of the cell viability, in the inhibition of the proliferation and in the induction of the apoptosis. Similar results were seen on Philadelphia-positive ALL cell lines and primary cells (n=3) combining the MK-1775 with the TKI, bosutinib. The simultaneously inhibition of the Wee1 and the BCR-ABL downstream pathway resulted in a synergic inhibition of the cell viability, reduction of the proliferation and induction of apoptosis. In our opinion the pre-clinical results of this study are the basis for a future clinical evaluation of MK-1775 for the treatment of ALL patients.
