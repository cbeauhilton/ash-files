    "abstract_text": "Background: Poor prognostic factors for patients (pts) with R/R HD include primary refractory disease and resistance to salvage CT with long-term progression- free survival (PFS) of 40\u201352% and 11\u201319%, respectively. Results of a prospective phase I/II trial incorporating TLI conditioning with AuSCT for pts with R/R HD are reported. Methods: 47 pts received salvage CT followed by peripheral blood AuSCT from November 1993 to April 2005. Salvage consisted of ESHAP (n=29), ICE (n=9), MOPP (n=3), ABVD (n=2) and unknown (n=4). Conditioning for AuSCT consisted of accelerated fractionation TLI 150 cGy BID starting day \u221235, with 1500 cGy to previously uninvolved nodal sites, 3000 cGy to previously involved, and 3540\u20134000 cGy to sites of active disease. After 1 week rest, conditioning CT consisted of carboplatin (450 mg/m 2 /d CI, D -6 to D-3), etoposide (700 mg/m 2 /d CI, D -6 to D-3), and cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/d D -3 and D-2) (CCE). Pts with no prior radiation (RT) received TLI + CCE, while those with prior RT received CCE alone. The first 18 pts received escalating etoposide doses up to 700 mg/m 2 /d with no unexpected toxicity. Results: Of 47 pts, primary and salvage therapy is known for 43; 14 had primary refractory HD, 20 pts had initial remission < 1 year (combined, 79% of study population). 26 pts responded to salvage (10 CR), and 17 pts < PR (40% CT-resistant). All 47 pts proceeded to AuSCT. 32 received TLI + CCE and 15 CCE alone. Median age is 36 years (range 18\u201366). PFS and overall survival (OS) for all pts was 47% and 57%, respectively (Figure) (median followup from AuSCT is 21 months, range 0.7 to 128 months). We also compared PFS for TLI + CCE versus CCE-alone conditioning, and a univariate analysis shows markedly increased PFS for TLI + CCE (p<.0001) (Figure). View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure  The PFS and OS for pts receiving TLI + CCE with primary refractory HD was 83% (10/12) and 92% (11/12) and for CT-resistant disease was 56% (5/9) and 78% (7/9). Using proportional hazards regression for a multivariate model including: histology, stage, initial remission < 1 year, B symptoms, CT resistance, prior RT and TLI, only TLI remained statistically significant (p=.017). Treatment related mortality (TRM) was 8.5% (4/47), including 2 secondary leukemias (100 day TRM was 4.2%). Conclusions: TLI and CCE conditioning was well-tolerated with low TRM and high and durable survival rates for pts with R/R HD. Moreover, very high PFS and OS rates were seen in historically poor-prognosis pts if TLI was given. TLI-based regimens should be studied further in randomized clinical trials compared to CT-alone conditioning regimens."
