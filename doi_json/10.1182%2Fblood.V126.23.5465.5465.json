    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the only cure for several patients with high-risk hematological malignancies. Recent advances in supportive therapies have significantly reduced the treatment-related mortality over the last decades. Nevertheless graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) still represents a major complication, and research is needed to achieve further progress in this area of transplantation. Moreover, although initial studies suggested relative equivalence, recent and large prospective studies showed higher rates of acute and chronic GvHD, and worse survival in allo-HSCT from unrelated donors (URD) compared with HLA-identical sibling donors. Following our encouraging results in haplodentical setting with the more recently post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) and sirolimus as GvHD prophylaxis (Cieri et al, 2015), in this study we investigated whether the incorporation of low dose anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) to PTCy and sirolimus GvHD prophylactic approach, may alleviate some of the increased alloreactivity associated with URD transplants. We retrospectively evaluated a cohort of 21 haematological patients receiving URD allo-HSCT in the San Raffaele Haematology and BMT Unit, from 2013 to 2015. All subjects had high-risk hematologic malignancies, with the most common diagnosis being myeloid diseases (52%). A total of 11 patients had active disease at HSCT, while 9 were in hematologic remission. Nine patients scored high according to disease risk index defined by Armand et al, 10 scored intermediate, while only 2 had a low disease score. Myeloablative conditioning consisted of treosulfan (14 g/m2/day) on days -6 to -4, fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day) on days -6 to -2, and melphalan (70 mg/m2/day) on days -2 and -1, followed by T-replete G-CSF-mobilized PBSCs (n=19) or BM grafts (n=2). Whether 12 patients received stem cells from HLA- matched URD (fully 10/10 HLA matched), the remaining 9 had one-locus HLA-mismatched from their donors. During conditioning patients received ATG-Fresenius 5 mg/kg per day IV on day -4 to -2. In vivo B-cell depletion was obtained by rituximab (i.v. 375mg/m2 given as a single dose on day -1). Postgrafting immunosuppression consisted of PTCy (50 mg/kg/day) on days 3 and 4. Sirolimus was given orally from day 5, and monitored to maintain a target therapeutic plasma level of 5-14 ng/ml. According to chimeric status and evidence of GVHD, the dosage of sirolimus was tapered during the second month post-transplantation, ending in complete withdrawal within the sixth month after HSCT. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was initiated orally at 10 mg/kg t.i.d. on day 5 after HSCT, and withdrawn on day 30. Median follow up was 247 days (range 29-486) from HSCT. All patients were engrafted in a median time of 17 days (range, 14-51 days), with full donor chimerism achieved by day 30. Poor graft function was observed in 11 patients. Post-HSCT recovery of lymphocyte subsets was lengthy as compared to other unmanipulated HSCT, with a median time to CD3>100/ml of 41 days (range, 22-389 days) by flow-cytometry, while 5 patients never reached immune reconstitution. All except one developed febrile neutropenia during aplasia. We observed a high rate of serious infections: severe pneumonia in 7 cases (5 required NIV, 4 were admitted to ICU), CMV reactivation in 13 (3 CMV disease), HHV6 reactivation in 10, BK virus haemorrhagic cystitis in 2 patients. Although the overall mortality associated with these complications was limited, as evidenced by a favourable NRM, it caused significant morbidity in patients and often required aggressive therapies, potentially contributing to poor graft function. The incidences of acute and chronic GVHD were low. A grade II-IV acute GvHD was reported in 10% patients, while five patients developed chronic GvHD (mild in 4 cases, only one moderate). Non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days and 1 year was 4.8% and 20.7%, respectively. The estimated 1-year overall survival (OS) and relapse incidence were 51% and 22.5% respectively. Although limited by a small number of patients with relatively short follow-up, our study suggests that URD allo-HSCT with ATG, PTCy and sirolimus-based GvHD prophylaxis, can be very effective in preventing GvHD, but at the expense of delayed immune reconstitution and high rate of infectious complications, while warranting acceptable NRM and relapse incidence.
