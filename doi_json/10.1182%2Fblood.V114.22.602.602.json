    "abstract_text": "Abstract 602 The molecular target(s) which co-operate with proteasome inhibition in inducing drug sensitivity or resistance in Multiple Myeloma (MM) remain unknown. We therefore conducted a genome scale small interfering RNA (siRNA) lethality study in KMS11 MM cells in the presence or absence of bortezomib without regard to pre-conceived mechanistic notions. Primary screening was performed in a single-siRNA-per-well format with the human druggable genome siRNA set V4 comprising 13,984 siRNA targeting 6,992 genes and comprising two RNAi per gene. siRNA were transfected at low concentration (13nM) to minimize off-target effects using conditions that resulted in transfection of >95% cells and <5% background cytotoxicity. Bortezomib was added (at the IC10, 25, 70 and 90) 24 hours post transfection. After 96 hours (72 hours after bortezomib), viability was measured by ATP-dependent luminescence. In primary screening 320 candidate bortezomib sensitizing genes were identified and rescreened with four siRNA oligos each gene. 57 of the top sensitizer hits were selected for which at least two distinct siRNA decreased the EC50 by 2 standard deviations from cells treated with control siRNAs. By cross referencing gene expression profile (GEP) data of KMS11, we furthered pared the list to 37 plausibly expressed targets (0.5% of those genes originally screened) as bortezomib sensitizers. After silencing, 50% of these 37 genes also sensitized the lung cancer cell line A549 to bortezomib. After further parsing of genes which also modulated the sensitivity of MM to Melphalan (non specific chemosensitizers), 34 genes remained: The strongest sensitizers to bortezomib were the proteasome subunits PSMA5, PSMB2, PSMB3, PSMB7 but included less obvious targets such as BAZ1B, CDK5, CDC42SE2, MDM4, NME7, TFE3, TNFAIP3, TNK1, TOP1, VAMP2 and YY1 were also identified. Of these, the most potent synergetic effects were observed with siRNAs against the proteasome subunits and against cyclin dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), which caused the greatest shift in EC50. CDK5 is of particular interest as a therapeutic target as it is expressed at high levels in MM and neural tissues but has low expression in other organs. Using viral shRNA expression, silencing CDK5 consistently increased the sensitivity of genetically variable MM cell lines (n=5) to all of the proteasome inhibitors tested: bortezomib, carfilzomib and PR047, and the effect could be at least partially rescued by overexpression of an RNAi resistant CDK5. To explore therapeutic relevance the small molecule CDK5 inhibitor, Roscovitin, was shown to be synergistic or additive with bortezomib in both MM cell lines and primary patient samples. Gene expression profiling was then performed to seek an explanation for the CDK5 sensitization effect and regulation of a proteasome subunit PSMB5 by CDK5 was identified as a probable route to sensitization. In summary inhibition of the existing proteasome either directly by suppression of proteasome subunits, or indirectly by suppression of modulators such as CDK5 appears to confer the greatest sensitization effect suggesting that combinations of bortezomib with other unique proteasome inhibitor drugs or combinations with inhibitors of CDK5 is a logical avenue for clinical exploration.
