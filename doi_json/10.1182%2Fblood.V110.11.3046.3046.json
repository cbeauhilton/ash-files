    "abstract_text": "We have previously shown that the combination of tacrolimus and sirolimus (TAC/SIR) without methotrexate (MTX) is a safe and effective regimen for GVHD prophylaxis after myeloablative SCT. However, TAC/SIR has not been investigated in the RIC setting. We hereby report a prospective phase II trial testing TAC/SIR as GVHD prophylaxis after RIC SCT from matched related donors (MRD). All patients received fludarabine (FLU) 30 mg/m 2 IV and intravenous busulfan (BU) 0.8 mg/kg IV daily \u00d7 4 days (day -5 thru day -2) as conditioning, followed by transplantation of filgrastim mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. Filgrastim 5 mcg/kg SC QD was started on day +1 until neutrophil engraftment. Tacrolimus and sirolimus were started on day-3, and doses were adjusted to maintain target serum trough levels 5\u201310 ng/ml and 3\u201312 ng/ml, respectively. Twenty-six patients have been transplanted, with a median age of 52 years (range 29\u201364 yrs). Diagnoses include NHL (8), AML (6), HD (5), CLL/SLL (3), CML (2), MDS (1), MM (1). Median CD34+ cells infused was 8.06 \u00d7 10 6 cells/kg (range: 2.96\u201338.0 \u00d7 10 6 cells/kg). All patients had sustained hematologic engraftment. Only 4 (15%) patients developed neutropenia below ANC 500, and 6 (23%) had platelet counts below 20K. One patient had late graft failure at 7 months post transplant. Grade II-IV acute GVHD incidence was 20%, with grade III-IV incidence of 12%. No hepatic VOD or thrombotic microangiopathy was observed. Day +100 transplant related mortality (TRM) was 0%. The cumulative incidences of TRM and relapse at 1 year were 4% and 38%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 1 year was 74%. A high level (>90%) of donor-derived hematopoiesis was achieved in 68% by 1 month post transplant. Median donor chimerism at between day 20\u201350 post transplant was 93.5% (range 32%-99%), and 94% (range 22%-100%) at day 85\u2013115. With a median follow-up of 13.5 months among survivors (range 5.5\u201319 months), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) at 1 year were 58% and 79%, respectively. Compared to a historical cohort of 47 MRD transplant recipients treated with the same FLU/BU conditioning regimen and using TAC/SIR \u00b1 mini-MTX (5 mg/m 2 IV day +1,3,6) as GVHD prophylaxis, there was no statistical difference between TAC/SIR vs. TAC/SIR/MTX in the incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD (20% vs 11%, p= 0.48), cumulative incidence of relapse at year (38% vs. 57%, p= 0.25), 1-yr PFS (58% vs. 41%, p= 0.33), or 1-yr OS (79% vs. 73%, p= 0.79). These results demonstrate that omission of mini-MTX is permissible, and that the combination of TAC/SIR alone as GVHD prophylaxis following reduced intensity conditioning with FLU/BU is associated with low rates of acute GVHD, TRM, and high levels of donor chimerism after MRD SCT.",
