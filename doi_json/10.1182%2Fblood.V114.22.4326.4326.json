    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4326 Background Patients (pts) with recurrent and refractory haematological lymphoid malignancy (HLM) have a very limited survival expectance. RIC allo-SCT has been proposed as a strategy for retaining the graft versus malignancy effect of allo-SCT while decreasing transplant related mortality (TRM). Here, we retrospectively studied a series of 32 pts treated by RIC allo-SCT. Patients and methods Between April 2001 and November 2007, 32 pts with HLM underwent RIC allo-SCT with an HLA-identical sibling donor. Fifteen pts with multiple myeloma, 7 pts with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 6 pts with Chronic lymphoid leukaemia, 3 pts with Hodgkin lymphoma and 1 pt with Waldenstrom disease. At time of allo-SCT, 10 pts were in complete remission (3 received prior autologous transplant) and 22 in refractory/progressive disease (6 received prior autologous transplant). Median age was 38 years (range, 28-60) and the sex-ratio (M/F) 2,2. Median time from diagnosis to RIC allo-SCT was 18 (range,6-76) months. The conditioning regimen included Fludarabine 150mg/m 2 and Melphalan 140mg/m 2 . GVHD prophylaxis consisted of association cyclosporine (cSA) and mycophenolate (MMF). All pts received G-CSF mobilised peripheral blood stem cells, with a median CD34+ cell count: 6,2.10 6 /kg (range, 1.9-13,6). Results Neutropenia occurred in all pts (100%) and the median duration of aplasia was 9 (range, 5-16) days. Only 10 pts (31 %) required red blood cells transfusions and 23 pts (71 %) needed platelets transfusions. Acute GVHD was observed in 15 cases (47 %) including 10 cases of grade II-IV. Fifteen pts (75 %) had chronic GVHD, of whom 9 with an extensive form. Four pts (12 %) had CMV reactivation at a median time 60 (range, 52-80) days after transplantation. Six pts (18 %) had late onset relapse at a median time of 13 (range, 4-45) months. TRM was 43 % at one year after RIC allo-SCT. With a median follow-up of 60 (range 18-97) months, 12 pts (37,5 %) are still alive in complete remission with full donor chimerism. Twenty pts (62,5 %) have died (5 early severe infections, 10 GVHD, 3 after relapse, one myocardial infarction, and one accident). Overall and progression-free survivals at 8 years are 31 % and 30 % respectively. Conclusion This study, after a large follow-up, suggests that RIC allo-SCT is a potential therapy for refractory or progressive HLM. However, TRM is still high likely due to the inclusion of refractory and heavily pretreated pts with many comorbid conditions. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
