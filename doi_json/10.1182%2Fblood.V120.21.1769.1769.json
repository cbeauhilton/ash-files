    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1769 Background: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT cascade regulates cell survival, proliferation and differentiation in a variety of cells. In CLL cells PI3K pathway is constitutively activated leading to AKT activation and phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). CREB is a transcription factor overexpressed and constitutively phosphorylated in a variety of cancers and seems to have a role in tumor pathobiology. There is a great need to develop novel strategies for targeted therapy in CLL. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specifically targeting leukemic cells might be a rewarding approach. ROR1 is a type I transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase belonging to one of the twenty families of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). ROR1 is overexpressed on CLL cells but not in white blood cells of healthy donors. ROR1 is constitutively phosphorylated in CLL and siRNA transfection induced apoptosis. We have developed a unique anti-ROR1 mAb directed against CRD (cysteine-rich domain) of the extracellular region of ROR1 capable of inducing direct apoptosis of primary CLL cells. Our anti-CRD mAb induced dephosphorylation of the ROR1 molecule. Aims: To study the apoptotic effect of an anti-ROR1 CRD mAb and effects on downstream signaling pathways involved in CLL, specially the PI3-kinase/AKT/CREB pathway using primary CLL cells. Methods: Using a peptide-based mouse mAb generation method we produced several mAbs against the three extracellular domains of ROR1. In the current study we used one of the best anti-ROR1 antibodies, an anti-CRD mAb raised against the CRD region of ROR1 (Daneshmanesh et al., Leukemia. 2012 Jun;26(6):1348-55). Flow cytometry was used for surface staining of ROR1. Primary CLL cells were incubated with the anti-ROR1 CRD mAb and apoptosis was detected by the MTT assay and Annexin V/propidium iodide (flow cytometry) methods in a 24 h assay. Antibody untreated and treated cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis for identification of signaling molecules involved in apoptosis induced by the anti-ROR1 CRD mAb. We analysed total and phosphorylated levels of the following signaling proteins: AKT, p-AKT, PI3K, p-PI3K, CREB, p-CREB, ERK, p-ERK, PKC and p-PKC. Phosphoproteins were measured before incubation with the mAb and after 20 min-2 h. Results: ROR1 surface expression was detected on 80\u201385% of the CLL cells. The frequency of apoptotic cells induced by the anti-CRD mAb was in the range of 45\u201350% which is in accordance with our previous reports (see above). Time kinetics experiments using anti-ROR1 CRD mAb incubated with primary CLL cells revealed dephosphorylation of ROR1 downstream signaling molecules. We analysed the following molecules known to be involved in CLL: PKC, PI3-kinase and ERK1/2. After co-culturing CLL cells with the anti-ROR1 CRD mAb, Western blot analysis showed decreased level of phosphorylated AKT in treated compared to untreated samples. No changes in the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and PKC proteins were seen. Furthermore, we analysed the PI3-kinase protein which is upstream of AKT, and noticed that in CLL cells treated with the anti-ROR1 CRD mAb, the phosphorylation intensity of PI3-kinase p85 isoform has decreased but not p55 isoforrn. Moreover, we also studied the CREB phosphorylation in treated and untreated CLL samples and detected dephosphorylation of CREB in treated as compared to untreated samples. Conclusion: Incubation of CLL cells with an anti-ROR1 CRD mAb induced apoptosis of primary CLL cells. Apoptosis was preceded by dephosphorylation within 2 h of PI3-kinase, AKT and CREB proteins indicating deactivation of these signaling proteins by the anti-ROR1 mab. In untreated CLL cells no effect on phosphorylation of these proteins was noted. Furthermore our ROR1 mAb did not dephosphorylate PKC or ERK. Our data may suggest that activation of CREB molecule might occur via the PI3K/AKT pathway and may be a survival signal in CLL cells associated with the aberrant expression of ROR1. The constitutive phosphorylation of PKC and ERK1/2 seen in CLL might not be related to the overexpression of ROR1. Further studies are warranted for a better understanding of signaling pathways associated with ROR1 and the downstream signaling effects of ROR1 targeting drugs.
