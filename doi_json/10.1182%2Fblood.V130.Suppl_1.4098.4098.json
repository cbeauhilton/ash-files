    "abstract_text": "Introduction Bendamustine (B) and Gemcitabine (G) are active agents in relapsed or refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma (rHL) with complete response (CR) rates of around 70%. Potential benefit to combination of B, G and dexamethasone (BGD) as a second-line chemotherapy is unexplored. We report on early results of a run-in phase of a prospective, multicenter study by the Polish Lymphoma Research Group (PLRG) here focused on safety and stem-cell collection efficacy. Methods Patients with HL were eligible if they had a progressive disease (PD) during initial ABVD treatment or relapsed/progressed after completion of the first-line therapy including irradiation. BGD regimen included bendamustine 90 mg/m 2 iv, day 1 and 2, gemcytabine 800 mg/m 2 iv, day 1, 4, dexamethasone 20 to 40 mg po daily dose, day 1-4, in 3 week intervals for 4 cycles. Stem-cell collection was performed mostly after 2 nd BGD cycle. Treatment was discontinued in case of PD, serious adverse events or patient decision. Response to therapy was evaluated according to RECIL criteria (Younes A et al. Ann Oncol 2017). Patients in CR proceeded to ASCT. Patients with partial response (PR) or disease stabilization (SD) could be referred for ASCT off-study at physician's discretion. Results 19 pts were enrolled, 10 male, median age (range) 27 (22-55). 14 pts (73%) were primary refractory, 4 relapsed more than 1 year after the first-line treatment. Eligible patients received 2 (n=8), 3 (n=4), or 4 (n=6) cycles of BGD. 1 patient discontinued BGD after 2 nd cycle due to skin reaction and received 1 cycle of ICE before ASCT. PET-CT was performed after 2 (n=16), 3 (n=2), or 4 (n=1) BGD cycles. Response rates were: CR 73% (14/19), PR 11 % (2/19), PD 11% (2/18). PR converted to CR after additional 2 BGD cycles. One additional patient had PD after 3 rd BGD . 9 patients received additional BGD cycles awaiting ASCT. At the time of ASCT all 16 patients were in remission with CR rate of 84% by PET-CT. 19 patients were mobilized for stem-cell collection without plerixafor after the second (n=17) or third (n=1) BGD cycle, and 1 patient was mobilized with low-dose cytarabine after the 2 nd BGD. A median (range) CD34 cell harvest was 5.2x10 6 /kg (2.0-42.75x10 6 ). 11 patients completed and recovered from ASCT. BGD toxicity included pneumonia Grade 3 in 2 patients, mild cutaneous reaction in 2 patients, and 1 case of Grade 4 skin toxicity resulting in change of therapy to ICE after 2 cycles of BGD, nausea grade 3 and fever in patients each were reported. GCSF prophylaxis was administered by local practice. Conclusions Early results of BGD regimen as a second-line treatment in patients with mostly primary refractory HL are encouraging with acceptable toxicity, stem-cell collection efficacy, and complete response rate of 84%. A prospective, multicenter study is ongoing. Disclosures Paszkiewicz-Kozik: Celgene: Other: travel expenses; Servier: Honoraria; Roche: Honoraria, Other: travel expenses; Takeda: Honoraria.
