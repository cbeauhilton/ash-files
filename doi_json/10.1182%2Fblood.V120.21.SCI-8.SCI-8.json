    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-8 Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a disorder characterized by inflammatory lesions that include pathologic CD207+ dendritic cells. LCH has pleotropic clinical presentations ranging from single lesions cured by curettage to potentially fatal multisystem disease. The first descriptions of LCH, including Hand-Schu\u0308ller-Christian disease and Letterer-Siwe disease, were based on anatomic location and extent of the lesions. Despite clinical heterogeneity, LCH lesions are generally indistinguishable by histology, which led to the notion that the spectrum of clinical manifestations represents a single disorder, histiocytosis X. The designation \u201cLangerhans cell histiocytosis\u201d was subsequently proposed with discovery of cytoplasmic Birbeck granules in the pathologic infiltrating dendritic cells in histiocytosis X lesions, a feature shared by epidermal Langerhans cells. The etiology of LCH remains elusive, and debate of LCH as an inflammatory versus malignant disorder remains unresolved. However, recent discoveries question the model of LCH arising from transformed or pathologically activated epidermal Langerhans cells. We found cell-specific gene expression signature in CD207+ dendritic cells within LCH lesions to be more consistent with immature myeloid dendritic cell precursors than epidermal Langerhans cells. Furthermore, recent mouse studies demonstrate that CD207+ is more promiscuous than previously appreciated. Langerin (CD207) expression can be induced in many dendritic cell lineages, supporting the plausibility of a spectrum of candidates for an LCH cell of origin, including circulating dendritic cell precursors. Finally, recurrent activating BRAF mutations in LCH lesions suggest a role for a hyperactive RAS pathway in LCH pathogenesis, and possibly in normal dendritic cell development. This presentation will discuss the historical background and recent advances in LCH biology, along with a proposal to reframe \u201chistiocytosis X\u201d as a myeloid neoplasia caused by aberrant maturation and migration of myeloid dendritic cell precursors.
