    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Since a link between solar radiation, vitamin D production, and decreased colon cancer mortality was established in 1980, there has been increasing interest in vitamin D and cancer, suggesting that higher vitamin D levels improve overall survival, specifically in breast and colorectal cancer (Maalmi H et al, Eur J Canc , May-2014, PMID 24582912), but also in follicular lymphoma (Kelly JL, J Clin Onc , 1-May-2015, PMID 25823738). In myeloma, largest published series is from the Mayo Clinic reporting on 148 newly diagnosed MM patients for which no survival association was found, but there were associations between low 25-OH-Vit D (<20 ng/mL) and higher serum CRP, serum creatinine, and ISS stage (Ng AC, Am J. Heme, Jul-2009, PMID 19415724); we wanted to expand on their trailblazing analysis. Cytogenetically high risk myeloma characterized by the amplification of 1q21 is associated with increased serum levels of soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6r) (Stephens OW, Blood , 2012, PMID 22072558) which may be associated with other markers of inflammation, e.g. CRP, creatinine, and b2microglobulin. Methods: The Buckeye Myeloma Registry (OSU 10115) opened in 2011 to enroll any patient with a plasma cell dyscrasia. Serum total 25-OH-Vitamin D was measured at the time of the initial clinic visit to the myeloma group at Ohio State. Results: Of a total of 843 patients, 115 (13.6%), 53 (6.3%) with SMM, and 675 (80.1%) with MM. In the 675 MM patients, the median age was 64 y.o. (range 28-95), 14.5% African-American and the remainder Caucasian, with 28.6% ISS stage 1, 48.7% ISS stage 2, 21.9% ISS stage 3, and 24.5% unknown. At diagnosis for the MM patients, 67% presented with lytic bone disease. Out of 675 MM patients, there were 52 (7.7%) patients with < 10 ng/mL 25-OH-Vit D, 394 (51%) with low vit D (10-30 ng/mL), and 229 (39%) for 25-OH-Vit D 30-100 ng/mL. There was no correlation between 25-OH-Vit D and BMI or creatinine, but there was a strong correlation with race (r=0.18, p<0.000026). Among the MM patients, log-rank [Mantel-Cox] analysis of overall survival with serum 25-OH-Vit D including all groups demonstrated no significant differences (p=0.9725) with only 101 events. There was no correlation between 25-OH-Vit D and the presence on CD138-selected FISH of 1q21 amplification (p=0.196), 17p (p53) deletion (p=0.68), or 13q deletion (p=0.812). Conclusion: The majority of myeloma patients are vitamin D deficient, but this was not associated with worsened overall survival or with high risk cytogenetics. Cox proportional hazards analyses of survival adjusted for significant univariate covariates will be presented at the meeting. Correlations with presence or absence of diffuse lytic bone disease, severity of renal insufficiency, and race will also be presented at the meeting.
