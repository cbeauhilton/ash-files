    "abstract_text": "Introduction The majority of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients (pts) in chronic phase (CP), present satisfactory response to imatinib treatment. However, 25-30% of these pts exhibit suboptimal response or treatment failure. The probability of achieving optimal response may be related with several factors. The human organic cation transporter 1 ( hOCT1, SLC22A1 ), an influx transporter, is responsible for the uptake of imatinib into chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells The aim of this study was to analyze hOCT-1 levels at diagnosis of CML patients and correlate with cytogenetics and molecular responses. Methods hOCT-1 expression was evaluated in 58 newly diagnosed CML pts. Pts were treated with imatinib 400-600mg in first line. Samples were collected from peripheral blood at diagnosis and RNA was obtained from total leucocytes. For cDNA synthesis, 3 ug of RNA was used. hOCT-1 expression was evaluated by real-time PCR with TaqMan probe SLC22A1 (Applied Biosystems) and endogenous GAPDH control. The results were analyzed using 2 -\u0394\u0394CT . Cytogenetic analysis was performed at diagnosis, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after starting therapy and then every 12-24 months thereafter if CCR was achieved. BCR-ABL transcripts were measured in peripheral blood at 3-month intervals using quantitative RT-PCR (RQ-PCR). Results were expressed as BCR-ABL/ABL ratio, with conversion to the international scale (IS). Major molecular response (MMR) was defined as a transcript level \u2264 0.1%. Results 58 CML pts, 60% male, median age of 46 years (19-87) were evaluated, 71% in chronic phase (CP), 21% in accelerated phase (AP) and 5% in blast crisis (BC). The mean and median of hOCT-1 transcript levels in the total group was 2.03 and 0.961 respectively (0.008\u201319.039) and CP pts was 1.86 and 1.00 (0.008-10.34).The median duration of imatinib treatment was 27 months (1-109) and 96.6% achieved complete hematological response, 79.3% complete cytogenetic response and 69% major or complete molecular response. The regression analysis showed correlation between higher transcript levels of hOCT-1 and BCR-ABL transcripts<10%) at 3 months analysis (p<0.0001). Albeit, there was no influence of the hOCT-1 transcript levels at diagnosis in the achievement of cytogenetic and molecular response at 24 months of treatment. Conclusions In this report, we found that high hOCT-1 expression was predictive of BCR-ABL transcripts<10% at 3 months, although we did not find correlation between hOCT-1 levels at diagnosis and the achievement of molecular response at 24 months, studies show that there is correlation between BCR-ABL log reduction in the first months of treatment and the achievement of molecular response.
