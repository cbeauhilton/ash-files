    "abstract_text": "Background: RBC transfusion can induce alloimmune responses that lead to hemolysis. However, only a subset of transfused patients become alloimmunized, and there is heightened interest in identifying factors that promote or inhibit alloimmunization. The frequency of alloimmunization has recently been shown to be increased in patients with inflammatory disease. In mouse models, inflammation induced by the viral RNA mimetic, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), profoundly enhances alloimmune antibody responses. Poly(I:C) induces production of inflammatory cytokines, including Type 1 interferon (IFN\u03b1\u03b2) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), which recruits CCR2 expressing monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) from bone marrow. We hypothesize that IFN\u03b1\u03b2 promotes inflammation-induced RBC alloimmunization by regulating MoDC-mediated consumption of transfused allogeneic RBCs. Methods: To investigate the role of inflammation in alloimmunization to a human RBC antigen, we utilized a novel mouse model that expresses high levels of the human KEL glycoprotein specifically on RBCs (KEL hi ). Poly(I:C) was administered to wildtype (WT), CCR2 -/- , and IFNAR1 -/- mice, which lack the IFN\u03b1\u03b2 receptor, at varying time points relative to transfusion of leukoreduced KEL hi RBCs. The alloimmune response was assessed by measuring KEL-specific IgG via flow cytometric crossmatch. For dendritic cell activation and RBC consumption experiments, RBCs labeled with fluorescent DiO were transfused following poly(I:C) injection. DiO-containing phagocytes, including Mo-DCs (CD11c + CD11b hi Ly6C + F4/80 + MHCII lo ), and activation markers were detected by flow cytometry 6hrs after transfusion. Results: WT Mice treated with poly(I:C) 3 hrs prior to RBC transfusion generated anti-KEL glycoprotein alloantibodies. However, alloantibodies were not detectable when poly(I:C) was withheld or administered at days -7, -1, +1, +4, or +7 in relation to RBC transfusion, indicating that inflammation may promote antigen consumption. Poly(I:C) treatment 3 hrs prior to transfusion of DiO-labeled KEL hi RBCs led to elevated activation marker expression and marked erythrophagocytosis by MoDCs in the spleen and peripheral blood. MoDC recruitment and RBC consumption were respectively mediated by CCR2 and IFNAR1-dependent mechanisms. Additionally, compared to WT controls, alloimmunization in the presence of poly(I:C) was significantly reduced in CCR2 -/- mice and completely abrogated in IFNAR1 -/- mice (Figure 1). Conclusions: Although inflammatory stimuli, including poly(I:C), have been shown to enhance alloimmunization, mechanisms underlying these results have been poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate an important role for MoDC erythrophagocytosis and a critical role for IFN\u03b1\u03b2 signalingin inflammation associated alloimmunization to a T-dependent human antigen expressed on murine RBCs. Although it is unclear whether these findings will apply to other RBC antigens in mice and humans, MCP-1 and IFN\u03b1\u03b2 are produced in inflammatory diseases associated with alloimmunization. Thus, identifying risk factors for inflammatory cytokine production in transfusion recipients may allow for personalized transfusion protocols for at risk patients.

Anti-KEL IgG antibodies in serum were measured by flow cytometric cross-match, completed by incubating serum from transfused mice with KEL hi RBCs, and subsequently staining for RBC bound IgG. The adjusted MFI was calculated by subtracting the reactivity of serum with syngeneic WT RBCs from the reactivity of serum with KEL hi RBCs. Data show the peak antibody response.
