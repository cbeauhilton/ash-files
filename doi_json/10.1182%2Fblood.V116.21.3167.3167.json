    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3167 Background: Incidentally diagnosed venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a growing clinical problem. Although pancreatic cancer is well-known to be associated with VTE, contemporary rates of incidental and symptomatic VTE events and their association with mortality are incompletely understood. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients seen at the University of Rochester from 2006\u20132009. Radiologic reports were reviewed for presence of pulmonary embolism (PE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and visceral vein thrombosis. Multiple clinical variables and mortality outcomes were collected. Data were analyzed using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Results: A total of 1151 radiologic exams for 135 patients were included. Forty-seven patients (34.8%) experienced at least one VTE event. There were 12 PEs (n=12 patients, 8.9%), 34 DVTs (n=17 patients, 12.6%), 47 visceral vein (n=31 patients, 22.9%) and 2 arterial (n=2 patients, 1.5%) events. Twenty-one patients (15.5%) experienced more than one event. Incidental events comprised 33.3% (n=4) of PEs, 17.6% (n=6) of DVTs and 100% (n=47) of visceral VTE. Median survival for the study population was 237 (95% CI 199\u2013277) days. Patients with VTE had significantly reduced survival (73 vs. 233 days at 3 months post-diagnosis; 66 vs. 245 days at 6 months post-diagnosis). There was no significant difference between asymptomatic and symptomatic events in terms of conditional median survival at 3 months-, 6 months- or 1 year-post diagnosis. In multivariate analysis, occurrence of either DVT (HR 7.4 95% CI 3.8\u201314.6, P<0.0001) or visceral asymptomatic events (HR 2.5 95% CI 1.6\u20133.8, P=0.0001) was significantly associated with mortality along with advanced stage. Conclusions: VTE occurs in over one-third of pancreatic cancer patients, including a significant proportion with incidentally discovered events. Patients with visceral vein events are generally not anticoagulated but these findings suggest a similar association with mortality as symptomatic DVT. Our findings require reconsideration of prognosis and anticoagulation options in pancreatic cancer patients with both incidental and symptomatic VTE.
