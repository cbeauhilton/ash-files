    "abstract_text": "Over last five years 154 patients received HLA matched sibiling transplants at Armed Forces Bone Marrow Transplant Centre, Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Indications for transplant included Aplastic anemia, B-Thalassaemia major, Chronic Myeloid leukemia, Acute leukemias, and miscellaneous disorders which included Myelodysplastic syndrome, Fanconi\u2019s anemia, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and Gaucher\u2019s disease. All patients received standard conditioning regimens and GvHD prophylaxis. Pre-transplant infection surveillance was carried out in all patients and strict prophylaxis against infection was observed as per our transplant policy. During post transplant follow up we encountered certain infective and non infective complications. These included: acute GvHD (grade II\u2013IV) 28.5%, chronic GvHD 15.5%, haemorrhagic cystitis 9.7%, VOD liver 5.1%, acute renal failure 3.2%, bacterial infections 51.2%, fungal infections 15.0%, CMV infection 4%, herpes zoster 4%, tuberculosis 2.6%, pneumocytitis jiroveci infection 0.6%, malaria 0.6% patient, graft rejection 5.2% patients and relapse in 4%patients. We encountered certain rare unexpected post transplant complications which have been rarely reported in literature before. These included Hickman catheter embolization, Guillain Barre syndrome, co-infection with pneumocystis jirovicii and a rare fungus trichosporon beigilii, cyclosporine induced uncontrolled seizures, idiopathic polycythemia, haemorrhagic pericardial effusion with cardiac temponade, deep vein thrombosis, dengue fever and measles. These complications were effectively managed in our centre. There was only one death associated with these complications. Mortality was observed in 27.2% patients. Mortality related to non-infective complications was 14.2%. Major non-infective causes of mortality were GvHD, VOD, disease relapse, intracranial haemorrhage and acute renal failure. Mortality related to infections was 13%. Fatal infections included CMV disease, disseminated aspergillosis, p seudomonas septicaemia and tuberculosis."
