    "abstract_text": "Background : CMML has a poor prognosis with a median overall survival of about 30 months and a 15-20% risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. For high-risk patients the median survival is 9 months. The only curative therapy is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). While several prognostic models have been proposed in CMML, their predictive value in allograft recipients is not well established. We report the outcome of allo-HSCT in 28 patients (pts) with CMML, and the relationship between five CMML prognostic scoring systems and post-transplant disease-free survival (DFS). Methods : 28 pts with CMML underwent allo-HSCT at MSKCC between 1/2002 and 2/2014. Pt and transplant characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Of the 28 pts, 6 had progressed to CMML-2 and 7 to AML pre-transplant. Except for 3 pts, all received chemotherapy before cytoreduction to decrease disease burden and all patients had <20% blasts prior to conditioning. Five prognostic scoring systems were used to classify the patients into low and high risk: 2 MDS and 3 CMML-specific models. T-cell depleted pts (n = 16, 60%) received myeloablative conditioning (12 busulphan/ melphalan/ fludarabine/ rabbit ATG and 4 TBI-based) whereas 12 pts (40%) received unmodified grafts with varying conditioning intensity. The source of HSC was 23 PB, 2 BM, and 3 cord blood. Results All pts had sustained donor engraftment. The cumulative incidences of day 100 grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and 1-year chronic GVHD were 18% (95%CI:3-32) and 17% (95%CI:1-33), respectively. The 1-year incidence of transplant-related mortality was 7% (95%CI:0-17) with the most common transplant-related cause of death being infection. Three pts relapsed for a 1-year incidence of 13% (95%CI:0-26). These patients died of their disease. With a median follow-up of survivors of 3.3 years (range 3 months-11.6 years), the 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival is 74% (95%CI: 51-88) and DFS is 71% (95%CI: 47-85). All pts classified as having high-risk disease had similar survival to low risk disease pts (Table 2). Conclusion : This preliminary data suggests that allo-HSCT can achieve a high DFS in pts with CMML, even in the setting of high-risk disease. Thus, allo-HSCT should potentially be considered in all patients with CMML including pts who have a dismal prognosis based on current prognostic scoring systems. Table 1.
