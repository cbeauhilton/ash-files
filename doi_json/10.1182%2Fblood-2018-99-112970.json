    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Over the last few years, novel agents-based combinations have been incorporated into the treatment of MM patients, particularly in relapse setting. However, these novel combinations have been evaluated in clinical trials and patients included represent a selected population. Patients in real life are usually older with comorbidities and disabilities and not allowed to be included in the trials, so, in real setting, is expected worse outcomes and shorter survival. The information about treatment burden in real life is scarce. The aim of our study was to analyze the outcome of MM patients in the real life outside clinical trials, in terms of treatment lines in a single institution setting, and to analyze the influence of comorbidities on the treatment burden. Material and methods: Medical records of MM patients treated at Txagorritxu hospital (Spain) between 2009 and January 2017 were retrospectively evaluated with the aim of mapping the course of patients as well as to investigate the factors that influence treatment-decisions at different stages of the disease. Results: 176 patients with MM were diagnosed from jan-2009 to jan-2017. Baseline patient's characteristics are presented in Table 1. The median age at diagnosis was 71 years (range 33.2-93), main of the patients where non-transplant eligible newly diagnosed MM (NTENDMM): 114 (65%). With a median follow-up of 25 months, 90.6% of newly diagnosed MM patients transplant-eligible (TENDMM) remain alive versus 65% NTENDMM patients (p value: 0.000)(figure 1). Overall, patients received a median of 2 lines of treatment, it should be noted that 86% of patients had received 3 or less lines of treatment and only 14% of the patients could receive more than 3 lines of therapy. To better evaluate treatment burden, we focused on deceased patients. At the time of analysis, 19% of TENDMM (12 patients) and 51.4% of in NTENDMM (57 patients) has died with a median time to death of 29.6 months and 18 months to death, respectively. Median lines of therapy for death patients TENDMM was 3.5 (range 1-8), with a 75 percentile of 5 lines of therapy, by contrast, death NTENDMM patients received a median of 2 lines of therapy (range: 1-6), with an 80 percentile of 3 lines of therapy (figure 2). In order to evaluate the influence of comorbidities in treatment burden for NTENDMM patients, CIRS score was estimated retrospectively. Median CIRS score was 5.5 (1-19). CIRS scale did not predict progression free survival (PFS) among the different groups: CIRS  8: 30.6 months (p: 0.819), however, interestingly CIRS scale predicted overall survival (OS): CIRS  8: 12.3 months, (p: 0.012) (figure 2). Analyzing treatment burden for each CIRS score group 63% of patients with CIRS> 8 received only one line of treatment before death, compared to 39.5% and 37.5% of patients with CIRS4-8 and CIRS <4, respectively. Conclusion: Although the impressive progress in the management of relapse/refractory MM patients in recent years, half of the patients, particularly those not suitable to received an autologous transplant, will be able to received only 2 lines of treatment before dying. In fact, an adequate comorbidity assessment could select patients that will only need only one line of treatment. To the best of our known, this is the first study that correlate treatment burden according to comorbidities at diagnostic. This study could guide strategies adapted according to the comorbidity of the patients.
