    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) that occurs during childhood and has a poor prognosis. Somatic or germline mutations in canonical RAS pathway genes, i.e., PTPN11 , NF1, NRAS , KRAS , and CBL , are reported be detected in approximately 85% patients. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative therapy for JMML. Although spontaneous remission is occasionally observed in others with supportive therapy, some patients show aggressive disease progression despite HSCT. Recent studies have identified several additional genetic events in an array of genes, including SETBP1 and JAK3 , but the relationship between genetic alterations and clinical outcomes remains unclear. Patients and Methods: A total of 131 patients (88 boys, 43 girls) with JMML were enrolled in the study. The median age was 15 months (range, 1-160 months). Eighty-two of 131 patients underwent HSCT, and 36 patients died (disease related, n = 27, transplantation-related complications, n = 16, infection, n = 5, unknown, n = 3). We performed comprehensive genetic analyses of the 131 JMML patients using whole-exome sequencing (n = 68, 52%) or targeted deep sequencing (n = 92, 70%), and assessed the impact of genetic alterations on clinical outcomes in 119 patients, excluding 12 patients with Noonan syndrome-related myeloproliferative disorder (NS/MPD). Results: We identified canonical RAS pathway gene mutations in 115 of 131 patients (88%). Although most RAS pathway mutations were mutually exclusive, coexisting secondary RAS pathway mutations were found in nine patients (8%). In addition, 28 patients harbored secondary genetic alterations in other genes, including SETBP1 (n = 10), JAK3 (n = 12), ASXL1 (n = 6), SH3BP1 (n = 1), RRAS2 (n = 2), and SOS1 (n = 3). In total, 34 of 131 patients harbored secondary genetic mutations. In univariate analysis, patients with secondary genetic mutations showed poorer survival rates than patients without these mutations [5-year transplantation-free survival (TFS) (95% CI) = 8.8% (2.3%-21.1%) vs. 24.1% (15.2%-34.1%), p = 0.007; 5-year overall survival (OS) (95% CI) = 49.6% (32.0%-65.0%) vs. 62.3% (50.8%-71.8%), p = 0.135]. On the basis of the dominant canonical RAS pathway mutations classification, patients with PTPN11 and NF1 mutations were significantly associated with the presence of secondary genetic mutations compared to patients with other RAS pathway gene mutations ( PTPN11 (20 of 43, 47%), NF1 (5 of 7, 71%), NRAS (2 of 18, 11%), KRAS (4 of 20, 20%), CBL (1 of 17, 6%), p < 0.001). Consistent with previous reports, patients with PTPN11 and NF1 mutations had inferior survival rates than other JMML patients [5-year TFS (95% CI) = 0% vs. 32.7% (21.5%-44.3%), p < 0.001; 5-year OS (95% CI) = 45.3% (31.1%-58.5%) vs. 68.1% (55.2%-78.0%), p = 0.006]. Multivariate survival analysis identified the RAS pathway mutations (i.e., patients with PTPN11 and NF1 mutations vs. others) [TFS: HR (95% CI) = 3.732 (2.382-5.847), p < 0.001; OS: HR (95% CI) = 1.983 (1.117-3.521), p < 0.019] and low platelet count (<33 \u00d7 10 9 /L vs. \u2265 33 \u00d7 10 9 /L) [TFS: HR (95% CI) = 1.816 (1.160-2.843), p < 0.001] as independent risk factors for TFS and OS. In subgroup analysis of 50 patients with PTPN11 and NF1 mutations, there were no significant survival differences between patients with (n = 25) or without (n = 25) secondary genetic mutations [5-year TFS (95% CI) = 0% vs. 0%, p = 0.753; 5-year OS (95% CI) = 39.6% (20.8%-57.9%) vs. 51.7% (30.9%-69.1%), p = 0.589]. Discussion: Consistent with previous studies, secondary genetic mutations were associated with inferior survival rates, but high correlations were observed in JMML patientswith PTPN11 and NF1 mutations. Our results suggest that comprehensive genetic mutational profiling is essential to estimate prognosis and to stratify JMML patients who require HSCT and/or novel treatment modalities.
