    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4759 Introduction Co-inheritance of Hb Rancho Mirage and Hb D-Punjab produces a clinically significant condition through increasing oxygen affinity that causes a compensatory erythrocytosis. We report a first case of co-inheritance of Rancho Mirage with Hb D-Punjab which differs in its clinical presentation from that described in the literature. Case presentation A 59-year-old Pakistani male was admitted to hospital because of chest tightness. The imaging studies showed no marked organomegaly or masses. Laboratory i nvestigations revealed erythrocytosis with high hematocrit and borderline MCV and MCH. Arterial blood gas testing (ABG) showed low p O2 and JAK2 V617F mutation was not detected. Erythropoietin level was normal. Hemoglobin analysis through high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed two hemoglobin variants; Hb D-Punjab (32.5%) and the remaining Hb comprised of a fast moving variant. The variant was faster than Hb F expressing at a considerably high level. There was no detectable Hb A. ( figure 1 , HPLC shows both variants) At the molecular level, the \u03b2 globin gene was amplified and sequenced using specific primers. DNA analysis demonstrated the presence of two mutations in Exon 3. The first one was a rare mutation in \u03b2Cd 143 (CAC\u2192GAC) causing a substitution of His\u2192Asp that was identified as Hb-Rancho Mirage. It is speculated that the replacement of the \u2018His\u2018 residue with that of \u2018Asp\u2019 would unequivocally alter the oxygen binding characteristics of the heme pocket. The other mutation was the common variant defined as Hb D-Punjab \u03b2Cd 121 (GAA\u2192CAA). ( figure 2 , DNA sequencing shows both variants). The patient had undergone regular venesection to alleviate erythrocytosis. Discussion The co-inheritance of Hb Rancho Mirage with Hb D-Punjab has never been reported previously. Both mutations exist in the \u03b2 globin gene giving rise to concomitant beta chain variants. Carriers of Hb Rancho Mirage are anticipated with mild anemia. However, coexistence of both abnormal hemoglobins showed functional defects manifested as polycythemia, likely due to the disruption of the 2,3 DPG binding site which is actively involved in the allosteric equilibrium during oxygen transport. The current case depicts the first occurrence of a double heterozygosity for two beta chain variants affecting exon 3 of the \u03b2 globin gene with a relatively mild to moderate phenotype. Family studies are recommended to understand further the structure and function relationship of this rare hemoglobin variant in association with a more common Hb D- Punjab.
