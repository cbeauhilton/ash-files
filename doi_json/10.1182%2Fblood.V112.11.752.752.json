    "abstract_text": "HOX genes encode highly conserved homeodomain (HD) transcription factors and are arranged in four groups (A\u2013D). During definitive hematopoiesis, HOX gene expression is activated 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 through each group. Therefore, HOX1-4 are actively transcribed in hematopoietic stem cells and HOX7-11 in committed progenitors. Under normal conditions, HoxA7-11 expression decreases during CD34+ to CD34\u2212 maturation. Abnormal Hox expression is characteristic of several poor prognosis subtypes of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) including AML with translocations or duplications of the MLL gene. In such leukemias, expression of HoxB3, B4 and A7-11 is sustained in CD34\u2212CD38+ cells. In murine bone marrow transplantation experiments, expression of MLL fusion proteins, HoxA9 or HoxA10 induces a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) characterized by increased neutrophils (PMN). Over time, the mice progress to AML with circulating myeloid blasts. These results suggest overexpression of HoxA9 or HoxA10 is adequate for MPD, but differentiation block (AML) requires additional lesions. We found that HoxA9 and HoxA10 proteins not only decrease in expression during the CD34+ to CD34\u2212 transition, but also are tyrosine phosphorylated. In additional studies, we found that HoxA10 tyrosine phosphorylation state is relevant for differentiation stage-specific target gene expression during myelopoiesis. HoxA10 represses genes encoding phagocyte effector proteins in undifferentiated myeloid cells. During myelopoiesis, phosphorylation of conserved HD-HoxA10 tyrosines decreases binding to these genes, permitting phenotypic and functional differentiation. HoxA10 activates transcription of the gene encoding Mkp2 (Dusp4) in myeloid progenitors. Decrease in HoxA10-binding to this gene as differentiation proceeds decreases transcription and renders the cells susceptible to Jnk induced apoptosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that genetic lesions which influence post translational modification might cooperate with HoxA10 overexpression to lead from MPD to AML. In myeloid progenitors, HoxA10 is maintained in a non-phosphorylated state by SHP2 protein tyrosine phosphatase. SHP2 activity decreases as differentiation proceeds. Activating mutations in SHP2 have been described in AML. We found that such activated SHP2 mutants dephosphorylate HoxA10 through out ex vivo myelopoiesis. Therefore, we investigated cooperation between these two leukemia associated abnormalities in vivo. Mice were transplanted with bone marrow overexpressing HoxA10 (or empty vector control) with or without activated SHP2 (E76K). To control for SHP2 overexpression, other mice were transplanted with bone marrow overexpressing HoxA10 and wild type SHP2. Mice transplanted with bone marrow overexpressing HoxA10 (\u00b1SHP2) developed MPD which evolved to AML over 4 mos, consistent with previous observations. However, mice transplanted with bone marrow overexpressing HoxA10 and E76K SHP2 developed AML within 4 wks. This rapid development of AML correlated with abnormalities in expression of myeloid specific HoxA10 target genes. These studies indicate the importance of HoxA10 post translational modification for physiologically relevant function and identify cooperating lesions which may be significant for disease progression in human AML.",
