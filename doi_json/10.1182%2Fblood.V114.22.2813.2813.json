    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2813 Poster Board II-789 Osteoclast, in addition to eroding the bone resulting in lytic lesions, enhances plasma cell proliferation and survival via direct cell to cell contact. Src family protein tyrosine kinases (SFKs) and c-Abl kinase play important role downstream of integrin adhesion receptors, and regulate the cytoskeletal organisation, cell motility and gene expression in response to cell adhesion. We hypothesised targeting SFKs and Abl kinase with the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor Dasatinib has potential to reduce adhesion of plasma cells to ECM proteins in the bone marrow and modify the microenvironment by inhibiting osteoclast function, specifically bone resorption. As a result, myeloma cells could be sensitised to drugs with cytotoxic properties such as dexamethasone. Osteoclasts were generated from primary bone marrow mononuclear cells of myeloma and MGUS patients (n=10). Using Immunofluorescence, we found that Dasatinib 100nM but not dexamethasone inhibited osteoclastogenesis and disrupted the actin cytoskeletal organisation with actin clusters formed in the periphery of the cell. There was absence of actin ring formation at sealing zones which is essential for bone resorption. This effect consistently led to impaired osteoclast function, evidenced by fewer resorption pits formed on rabbit dentine slices on toluidine blue staining. Experiments were repeated \u2265 3 times. In plasma cells, the combination of dexamethasone and Dasatinib synergistically (Calcusyn software) inhibited cell proliferation at clinically relevant concentrations and induced apoptosis of human and murine myeloma cell lines alone and in cocultures with human stromal cells ( p<.001). Dasatinib alone at 200 nM concentration does not inhibit plasma cell proliferation with maximal serum concentration achieved in Phase I CML trials being 180nM. Additionally, Dasatinib and Dexamethasone in combination inhibited secretion of IL-6 but not MIL -1 alpha in stromal cell cocultures. Dasatinib but not dexamethasone significantly inhibited adhesion of myeloma cell lines on Fibronectin despite integrin activation with Magnesium EGTA. This effect was mediated through down regulation of both Src and Abl phosphorylation. Both Dasatinib and Dexamethasone inhibited adhesion of PC on stromal cells and osteoclasts. Taken together, our in vitro results suggest that Dasatinib and dexamethasone could be an effective therapeutic combination with Dasatinib impairing adhesion of plasma cells to the bone marrow microenvironment as well as osteoclast function and resultant bone disease thereby sensitising myeloma cells to the cytotoxic effect of dexamethasone. We have also established that the combination of Dasatinib 75mg/kg and dexamethasone 1mg/kg is not toxic to C57BL/KaLwRij mice. The anti-myeloma efficacy of these drugs alone and in combination is being currently studied. The combination of Dasatinib 100 mg OD days 1-28 and Dexamethasone 20mg OD on Day 1-4, 15-18 has resulted in a partial response (EBMT criteria) in 2 multiply relapsed and steroid refractory myeloma patients without significant toxicity. Serum calcium levels fell commensurate with disease response and we are currently performing experiments to analyse the effect of the drug combination on osteoclast function in vivo . These findings warrant exploring this drug combination in steroid resistant myeloma and patients with extensive skeletal disease prospectively in a phase I/II trial.
