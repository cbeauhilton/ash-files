    "abstract_text": "Abstract 877 Introduction: Patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) usually respond well to immuno-chemotherapy as initial treatment and can have long survival times. However, a small proportion of patients are refractory or have early relapses. Early identification of this subgroup of patients could lead to early therapeutic changes and, potentially, to a better prognosis. [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-TEP) is widely used for the staging and restaging of aggressive lymphoma patients but little is known about the use of FDG-PET in patients with FL, except that FL is almost uniformly FDG-avid. FDG-PET is not recommended today as a routine procedure in FL patients (Cheson et al. J Clin Oncol 2007). In this first prospective, multicentric study, we evaluated the prognostic value of FDG-PET performed at mid-treatment and at the end of treatment in patients with high-tumor mass FL treated with immuno-chemotherapy in first line. Patients & methods: Patients with previously untreated FL (grades 1\u20133A) presenting with a high tumor burden as defined by the GELF criteria, were treated with 6 cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) plus 2 cycles of rituximab, given every 21 days. Patients did not receive rituximab maintenance. A FDG-PET was performed before treatment, after 4 cycles of R-CHOP (interim FDG-PET: I-PET), and at the end of treatment (final PET: F-PET). FDG-PET scans were first interpreted in each centre, then centrally reviewed by 3 investigators blinded to clinical data. Positivity or negativity was rated according to the Deauville visual semi-quantitative criteria (Meignan M: Leuk Lymphoma 2009), positivity being defined as a fixation at level 4 (FDG uptake superior to that of the liver) or 5 (uptake clearly superior to liver and/or new sites of disease). Results: 121 patients were included. The median age was 57 years and the male-to-female ratio was 1.12. Ninety-three percent had Ann Arbor stage III\u2013IV. Ninety-seven percent had a good performance status (ECOG score 0\u20131). The repartition according to the FLIPI was: 0\u20131 factors: 15%; 2 factors: 43%; 3\u20135 factors: 42%. The Kappa coefficient indicated a good degree of concordance between the 3 PET reviewers. The initial FDG-TEP was positive in all except 1 case out of 118 centrally reviewed cases. After central review, I-PET (n=111) was negative in 76% of patients and F-PET (n=106) was negative in 78%. With a median follow-up of 23 months, 2-year-progression-free survival rates for I-PET negative versus positive and for F-PET negative versus positive were I-PET 86% versus 61% (p=0.0046); F-PET 87% versus 51% (p <0.0001), respectively. Two year OS at the end of treatment also significantly differed according to F-PET results: 100% vs 88% (p = 0.0128). Conclusion: In FL patients treated in first line, FDG-PET performed either after 4 cycles of R-CHOP or at the end of immunochemotherapy induction is strongly predictive of outcome. Therapeutic intervention based on TEP results during inductive treatment should be evaluated in the future.
