    "abstract_text": "We previously identified a role of B-cell activating factor (BAFF), a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, in localization and survival of MM cells in the BM microenvironment ( Cancer Res  2006 , 66 : 6675 \u201382 ). In the present study, we examined the potential therapeutic utility of the BAFF inhibitor, AMG523, for treating human MM using MM lines, either sensitive or resistant to conventional chemotherapy, as well as freshly isolated patient MM cells, in the presence or absence of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). AMG523 induces modest cytotoxicity in MM cell lines and patient MM cells, suggesting a minor role of autocrine mechanism of BAFF for MM growth and survival. In the presence of BMSCs, AMG523 significantly decreased growth and survival in dexamethasone (Dex)-sensitive MM1S, Dex-resistant MM1R, INA6 MM cells and in patient MM cells (n=7), in a dose-dependent manner (0.1\u201310 \u03bcg/ml). BAFF-augmented MM adhesion to BMSCs is also blocked by AMG523 at 0.1 mg/ml in MM lines (MM1S, 28PE, INA6), as well as in freshly isolated patient MM cells (n=4). BAFF protects MM cells against dex- and lenalidomide-induced cytotoxicity; conversely, AMG523 blocks BAFF-induced protection against drug-induced apoptosis. Importantly, pretreatment of AMG523 blocks BAFF-induced activation of AKT, nuclear factor kB, and ERK in MM cells, confirming its inhibitory effect on BAFF-mediated adhesion and survival. We next asked whether AMG523 enhances Dex-, bortezomib-, Lenalidomide-induced MM cell cytotoxicity. AMG523 augments the inhibitory effect of Dex and lenalidomide in patient MM cells in the presence of BMSCs. Since osteoclasts (OCLs) secrete BAFF in the bone marrow microenvironment, we further asked whether AMG523 inhibits protection by MM-OCL interaction. OCLs were derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from MM patients after 2-week culture with M-CSF and RANKL, and MM cells were added in the presence or absence of AMG523. OCLs significantly increased MM cell survival, evidenced by annexin V and PI staining followed by flow cytometric analysis; conversely, AMG523 blocked MM cell survival by coculture with OCLs. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the novel therapeutic AMG523 blocks the interaction between BAFF and its receptors in human MM, thereby providing the rationale for clinical trials of AMG523 to improve patient outcome in MM."
