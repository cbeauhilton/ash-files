    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Nilotinib is a selective bcr-abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is 30-fold more potent than Imatinib in vitro. To examine the molecular and functional effects of Nilotinib and Imatinib we performed gene expression and functional analyses in K562 cells following in vitro treatment with the two tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Particular emphasis was put on 1539 genes which we found to be differentially expressed in primary CD34+ cells from patients with CML in first chronic phase in comparison to CD34+ cells from normal bone marrow (Diaz-Blanco et al., Leukemia 2006). Methods: Affymetrix U133A 2.0 microarrays covering 21.722 probe sets were used to analyse the gene expression profile of 5x10 7 K562 cells after 24h in vitro treatment with Imatinib (0.5 \u03bcM) or Nilotinib (0.05 \u03bcM) (half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC 50). FISH analysis confirmed the K562 cell line to be BCR-ABL positive. Gene expression data of the treated cells were compared with the data of untreated cells. In addition, proliferation (Cell Titer 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega), apoptosis (Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS, Roche) and cell cycle (FITC BrdU Flow Kit, BD Pharmingen) assays were performed. A colony assay was performed to see differences in cell growth. Results: Looking at those 1539 differentially expressed genes in K562 cells which distinguish patients with CML from healthy donors, we found that Imatinib led to a significant downregulation of 187 and upregulation of 45 genes. In general, Nilotinib had a more pronounced effect than Imatinib regarding the number of genes affected and the degree of suppression. It caused downregulation of 418 and upregulation of 41 genes. Of note, genes affected by Nilotinib included all genes altered by Imatinib such as those related to bcr-abl signalling (Lyn, BCL2, Myc, PIK3CB, G3BP2). Downregulation of genes involved in cell cycle (CDK2, ORC5L, MCM3, POLE2, CCNG1) was only observed following Nilotinib exposure. The stronger effect of Nilotinib is in line with the results of cell cycle experiments showing that Nilotinib exposed cells had the lowest proportion of actively cycling cells. The proportion of apoptotic K562 cells was 5.5 fold greater following treatment with Nilotinib in comparison to Imatinib after 24 hours. Treatment with either Imatinib or Nilotinib produced a similar apoptotic rate and similar decrease in cell numbers after 96 hours. In the colony forming assay, the controls (K562 cells incubated with DMSO only) displayed strong leukemic growth which was inhibited by both Nilotinib and Imatinib, allowing only small clusters to appear. Conclusion: Nilotinib is apparently more potent than Imatinib with regard to the number of genes downregulated and the degree of their suppression. Many of the suppressed genes are associated with bcr-abl signalling and cell cycle.",
