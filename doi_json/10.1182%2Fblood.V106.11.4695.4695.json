    "abstract_text": "Relatively little is known about the quality of life (QOL) status among long-term (5\u201320 year) lymphoma survivors. Using the Mayo Tumor Registry, we identified eligible patients who were 16 years or older at diagnosis, U.S. residents, first diagnosed with Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma from 1984\u20131998, diagnosed and/or initially treated at Mayo Clinic Rochester, and survived for 5 to 20 years (N=2,485). In October of 2004, we mailed a 23-page survey to 95 randomly selected patients; 7 were found to be ineligible (deceased or too ill). Of the 88 remaining patients, we were able to find a correct address for 82, and 57 completed a survey for a 70% participation rate. QOL assessments included the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G), and a series of linear analogue self-assessment (LASA) single-item QOL measures. Results for the pilot sample were compared to normative data for each measure relating to general cancer patient populations. All scores were transformed onto a 0\u2013100 point scale (higher score meaning higher functioning) for ease of comparison. Of the 54 patients with complete data for analysis, the mean age at survey was 60.8 years (6.3\u201319.9). The mean time since diagnosis was 12.0 years (6.3\u201319.9), and 52% had survived more than 11 years. The mean total score for the FACT-G was 89 compared to a norm of 74 for cancer patients. Higher scores were also seen in the lymphoma survivors in each of the four FACT-G subdomains (physical, social/family, emotional and functional well-being) compared to normative cancer patient populations. The global LASA QOL measure was also higher among lymphoma survivors (mean score of 82 compared to a norm of 77), and only 7% reported a global QOL score of 50 or lower, indicative of impaired QOL. Functioning among the lymphoma survivors was higher compared to general cancer patients on the mental, physical, emotional, social, pain, fatigue, financial, and legal LASA items, while functioning was similar to general cancer patients on the spiritual and support LASA items. However, scores suggestive of impaired QOL were reported by more than 10% of the patients for the social (17%), pain frequency (31%), fatigue (20%), and financial concerns (25%) items of the LASA. There were suggestive results of effect sizes indicating that smokers had lower FACT-G physical and emotional scores, and lower LASA mental and physical QOL scores, although none achieved statistical significance. In conclusion, this pilot sample of long-term lymphoma survivor patients reported having high QOL on most domains of the FACT-G and LASA relative to other cancer patient populations. There appears to be a subset of patients who experience impaired QOL and who may require further interventions, particularly in the QOL domains of social, pain, fatigue, and financial functioning. These results also suggest that awareness of smoking status may be important. Further larger studies are needed to confirm these preliminary data and to evaluate other aspects of QOL."
