    "abstract_text": "Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is associated with pathogenesis of AML and required for establishment of leukemic stem cells. FLT3 mutations are frequently observed in AML and predict poor clinic outcomes. Aberrant activation of FLT3 signaling stabilizes \u03b2-catenin and increases its nuclear localization and transcriptional activity. FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are used to treat FLT3 -mutated AML, but their effects are limited due to primary or secondary resistance to TKIs. We previously reported (ASH 2015) that disrupting Wnt/b-catenin signaling by C-82, a selective \u03b2-catenin/cAMP binding protein antagonist in combination with FLT3 inhibitors had a synergistic cytotoxicity in vitro in FLT3 -mutated AML cells and AML stem/progenitor cells through inhibiting nuclear localization of \u03b2-catenin and suppressing the expression of \u03b2-catenin target proteins including survivin, CD44, c-Myc, and cyclin D1; several frizzled family receptors/co-receptors; Wnt ligands; and FLT3 downstream signaling proteins. The synergy was also observed in TKI-resistant FLT3 mutated cells. In this study, we evaluated the antileukemia effect of combined inhibition of \u03b2-catenin and FLT3 signaling in vivo in immunodeficient mice xenografted with FLT3 -ITD mutated cells either from a cell line or from an AML patient. Molm13-GFP/Luc cells were injected into NOD-SCID IL2R\u03b3Null (NSG) mice. Once engraftment was confirmed by in vivo imaging, mice were treated with PRI-724 (C-82 pro-drug), sorafenib, or both. Treatment with PRI-724 or sorafenib decreased leukemia burden, and the combination was the most effective as assessed by in vivo imaging, flow cytometric measurement of human CD45 + cells in blood, and bone marrow (BM) and spleen H&E staining. The mice in PRI-724 (19 days, P = 0.025) or sorafenib (28 days, P = 0.0002) treated group had significantly longer median survival time than the control group (17 days), and the combined treatment further prolonged the survival time (30.5 days) ( P = 0.0005, combination vs RPI-724; P = 0.0056, combination vs sorafenib). CyTOF and SPADE tree analysis showed a great reduction of human CD45 + cells and decreased expression of \u03b2-catenin, CD44, c-Myc, survivin, p-FLT3, p-ERK, p-AKT, and p-STAT5 in BM cells of the combination treated mice. Cells from a FLT3-ITD mutated AML patient sample collected from patient-derived xenograft (spleen) were injected into NOD-SCID IL2R\u03b3Null-3/GM/SF (NSGS) mice. After engraftment was confirmed by flow cytometry, mice were treated as above. Leukemia burden was decreased by sorafenib or PRI-724 treatment, as determined by flow cytometry measurement of human CD45 + cells in blood, BM, and spleen samples, but did not reach statistical significance. The combination significantly enhanced the antileukemia effect. PRI-724 (31 days, P = 0.008) or sorafenib (48 days, P = 0.0003) significantly prolonged median survival time compared with control (29 days), and the combination further extended the survival time (54 days) ( P = 0.0005, combination vs RPI-724; P = 0.0067, combination vs sorafenib). Our in vivo study further demonstrates that disruption of Wnt/b-catenin signaling exerts antileukemia activity and sensitizes with TKIs in FLT3 mutated AML. These findings provide a rationale for clinic development of combined inhibition of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and FLT3 signaling to overcome resistance and improve outcomes in AML patients with FLT3 mutations.
