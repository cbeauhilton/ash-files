    "abstract_text": "Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non coding RNAs that have been shown to play a regulatory role in a number of different settings including development, hematopoiesis and lineage-selection. The expression patterns of miRNAs in various cellular processes and in various normal and malignant tissues are an area of active exploration. Bioinformatic analyses of the genome suggest that there might be thousands of miRNAs encoded in the genome. However, thus far only about 600 unique miRNAs have been identified in humans. The role of microRNAs in B cell malignancies is poorly understood. Mature B cells comprise naive, germinal center, memory and plasma cells. These B cell stages comprise the majority of leukemias and lymphomas. We have previously demonstrated a role for microRNAs in the regulation of key transcription factors and oncogenes including PRDM1, LMO2 and MYBL1. We hypothesized that microRNAs play a role in the pathogenesis of lymphomas and have applied high throughput sequencing to understand the pattern and function of microRNA expression in normal B cells and their malignant counterparts. Methods: CD19+ mature B cells were obtained from normal patients undergoing tonsillectomy and sorted using flow cytometry into naive, germinal center, memory and plasma cells. We also obtained cells from tumor cell lines derived from mantle cell lymphoma (Mino, JVM2), Burkitt lymphoma (Ramos, BL41) and multiple myeloma (H929, U266), as well as patient tumor samples derived from Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphomas. From these cells, we purified small RNAs (18-25 nucleotides) and ligated sequencing adapters to these small RNAs and subjected them to 15 cycles of PCR amplification. The constructs were then subjected to massively parallel high throughput sequencing (Illumina) in picoliter wells to identify millions of sequences per sample. Sequences thus identified were matched to the genome and microRNAs were identified based on their characteristic stem-loop secondary structure, thermodynamic stability, and evidence of processing with the microRNA-related enzymes drosha and dicer. Results: Using massively parallel high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs isolated from these B cell subsets, we analyzed a total of 62,293,147 sequences (> 1.6 billion bases). We found that 261 known microRNAs are expressed in normal and malignant B cells, a number that is three times higher than previously recognized. Our work also identified the expression of 86 novel miRNAs in normal and malignant B cells, many of which appear to target genes important in B cell differentiation including BCL6, NLK, EBF, as well as oncogenes including MYC, LMO2, and CCND1. We found no evidence of decreased expression of microRNAs in B cell malignancies, in contrast to the described down-regulation of microRNAs in tumors from other lineages. On the other hand, there were striking differences between the microRNA expression patterns in normal and malignant B cells, although B cell malignancies still frequently express miRNAs that are characteristic of their normal B cell counterpart. Each malignancy had a characteristic pattern of microRNA expression that was distinct from other malignancies and normal B cells. Conclusion: Through high throughput sequencing, we have discovered novel microRNAs that target important oncogenes including BCL6, MYC, LMO2, and CCND1, suggesting a role for microRNAs in B cell lymphomas.",
