    "abstract_text": "Background: Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a main cause of morbidity and mortality in patients having undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). About 30-40% of patients have steroid\u2010refractory GVHD (SR\u2010GVHD) after the first\u2010line use of high doses of corticosteroids with a poor prognosis .Ruxolitinib is a promising treatment for SR-GVHD. However, data regarding optimum dosing, response rates and associated adverse events are scarce. Herein, we provide the first systemic review of literature for the use ruxolutinib in GVHD. Methods: A Medline (PubMed), google scholar, OVID and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews search using key words \"Ruxolutinib and GVHD\", \"Ruxolutinib and SR-GVHD\" was undertaken in June 2019. Only peer reviewed databases were searched and search was restricted to human studies of acute and chronic GVHD only. Results: 16 publications, as listed in Table 1. Only one was a prospective trial, all others were retrospective studies, case series (5), and case reports (2). Overall response, ranged 45% - 100%, complete response was noted in 5.2% -80% patients. Time to response was variable from 1-12 weeks. Cytopenias and infectious complications were frequently reported with dose reduction or interruptions needed in most studies. Maintained responses were reported in a small proportion after ruxolutinib discontinuation. Conclusion Ruxolutinib has promising efficacy in SR-GVHD , however cytopenias and infectious complications reported frequently mandate close monitoring. Results of ongoing prospective trials could provide answers for optimum dosing and response assessment, and management of related adverse events.
