    "abstract_text": "Background: Higher CD34 cell doses have been shown to increase the incidence of acute (Przepiorka D et al, 1999) and extensive chronic GVHD (Zaucha et al, 2001) following HLA-matched sibling SCT. Less is known about the influence of CD 34 cell dose in the unrelated SCT setting. Methods: A retrospective review was performed involving 81 consecutive adult patients (pts) who underwent unrelated donor G-CSF mobilised blood SCT in Vancouver between June 2000 and October 2006. NRM, relapse risk (RR) and overall survival (OAS) estimates were determined using a Kaplan-Meier technique and univariate and multivariate analyses were done to identify factors predictive of GVHD and outcome, with particular focus on cell dose administered. Characteristics: There were 46 male and 35 female pts with a median age of 44 (range 17\u201358) years. Diagnoses included acute leukemia (39 pts), chronic leukemia (14 pts), lymphoma (15 pts) and other (13 pts). Conditioning was TBI-based in 80/81 pts and GVHD prophylaxis was with continuous infusion Cyclosporine and short-course Methotrexate (MTX) (15mg/m 2 d +1 and 10mg/m 2 d+3, d+6 and d+11). Fifty of 81 pts received >80% of the planned MTX dose. Forty three pts received SCT from a 10/10 high-resolution HLA-matched donor, 25 pts received a 1-antigen mismatched SCT, 12 pts received a 2-antigen mismatched SCT and 1 pt a 3-antigen mismatched SCT. The donor was male for 68 pts and female for 13 pts. Median CD 34 cell dose was 7.75x10 6 (range\u22129.46x10 4 \u201333.6x10 6 )/kg. Results: The estimated 3-year NRM, RR and OAS were 39% (95%CI 25%\u201350%), 30% (95%CI 17%\u201341%) and 43% (95%CI 31%\u201358%), respectively. In multivariate analysis, CD 34 cell dose >7.75x10 6 /kg was associated with faster neutrophil engraftment, p80% of the planned MTX dose. Although having a female donor predicted for an increase in NRM (p=.03), it also was associated with a decrease in RR (0/13 pts) and did not affect OAS. Conclusion: A high CD34 cell dose in unrelated donor blood SCT is desirable in that it does not adversely influence the incidence of GVHD and is associated with faster neutrophil engraftment and a reduction in NRM. Delivery of at least 80% of the planned short-course MTX GVHD prophylaxis continues to be critical in producing a favourable outcome.",
