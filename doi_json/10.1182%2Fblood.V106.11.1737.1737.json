    "abstract_text": "The pointed-domain Ets transcription factor Fli-1 has a critical role during megakaryocyte-specific gene expression. Previously, we demonstrated that Fli-1 occupies the early megakaryocyte-specific gene \u03b1IIb in vivo. Moreover, our work suggested a mechanism for Fli-1 function by showing that Fli-1 facilitates GATA-1/FOG-1 dependent expression of the \u03b1IIb gene. However, studies by others with a targeted disruption of the Fli-1 gene in mice showed that while Fli-1 is essential for normal megakaryocyte maturation, \u03b1IIb mRNA levels were not significantly reduced in the resulting megakaryocytes, suggesting that a related Ets factor(s) might compensate for the loss of Fli-1. Here we show that the widely expressed pointed domain Ets protein GABP\u03b1 specifically binds in vitro to Ets elements from two early megakaryocyte-specific genes, \u03b1IIb and c-mpl. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments using primary murine fetal liver-derived megakaryocytes reveal that GABP\u03b1 associates with \u03b1IIb and c-mpl in vivo. Moreover, GABP\u03b1 is capable of mediating GATA-1/FOG-1 synergy in the context of \u03b1IIb promoter constructs. These results suggest that GABP\u03b1 contributes to megakaryocyte-restricted gene expression and is capable of at least partially compensating for the loss of Fli-1. However, loss of Fli-1 leads to a pronounced decrease in the expression of the late megakaryocyte-specific gene GPIX, indicating that compensation by GABP\u03b1 is incomplete. Consistent with this observation, ChIP experiments fail to detect significant levels of GABP\u03b1 at the regulatory region of GPIX while Fli-1 is readily detected there. Together, these results point to a model in which Fli-1 and GABP\u03b1 serve overlapping, but distinct roles, during the development of megakaryocytes. GABP\u03b1 may be important during early megakaryopoiesis, but Fli-1 exerting an essential role during late stages of maturation.",
