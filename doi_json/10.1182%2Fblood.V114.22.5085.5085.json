The pathogenesis of cancer anemia is complex and most of the time multifactorial; involving factors related to the tumor itself or its therapy. Recombinant human erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA) was widely used to prevent and treat cancer and chemotherapy-related anemia. However, many recent studies involving patients with different kind of cancers at different stages of their disease suggested a negative impact on disease progression and survival when such ESA were used to keep Hemoglobin (Hb) at a higher level. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced revisions and warning to restrict ESA indications. This report describes the prevalence of anemia in cancer patients and its management given the recent confusion and uncertainties. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive adult cancer patients admitted to regular medical units between Jan and Dec, 2008. Patients admitted to Leukemia, Bone Marrow Transplantation and Intensive Care Units were excluded. Demographic features, reasons for admission, primary cancer diagnosis and disease stage were determined. All patients with Hb value < 12 g/dL at any time during admission were considered anemic. Treatment offered for anemia was also reviewed. Subsequent admissions for the same patients during the study period were also followed up. Results 959 patients (51% males, median age 55 years, range 18- 91) admitted 1862 times were included. Reasons for admission at time of enrollment included chemotherapy (23%), infections including neutropenic fever (20%), palliative and supportive care (15%). Other reasons included pulmonary, neurological, renal and electrolyte imbalances. Primary cancer diagnosis included: Gastrointestinal (21%), Breast (16%), Lymphoma and Multiple Myeloma (16%), and Lung (11%). At time of enrollment, 55% of patients had advanced stage disease. Anemia at any time during admission was detected in 755 (78.7%) patients. Mean Hb value for anemic patients was 9.51 g/dL (range 3.5-11.9, median 9.6). Severe anemia (Hb < 8) was documented in 16.7%, moderate anemia (Hb 8-10) in 41.9% and mild anemia (Hb > 10) in 41.5% of the patients. Majority (69%) of the patients were not offered any treatment for their anemia. Among the total group, blood transfusion was offered for 25%, supplements (including iron, folate and or vitamin B12) for 3.3%. ESA were offered for only 1.1%. Few patients (2.1%) had combined treatment. Mean Hb value at which treatment was started was 8 g/dL, while mean Hb for the patients who were not treated was 10.2 g/dL. Most of the patients (94%) with severe anemia, 32% with the moderate, and 5% of the patients with mild anemia were treated as shown in the table .  Severity of anemia . Mild . Moderate . Severe .

Given the recent FDA warning and the many confusing studies, the prevalence of anemia in cancer patients was found to be high; many of such patients were not offered any treatment. The threshold to start treatment was highly dependent on its severity. Blood transfusion was the most common treatment method. Quality improvement projects should be implemented to better recognize and treat anemia in cancer patients. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
