    "abstract_text": "Between 1993 and 2005, 57 patients with follicular lymphoma underwent high-dose chemo/radiotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), 49 Allogeneic, (16 Bone Marrow and 33 Peripheral Blood), 6 MIN, 2 MUD. Median age was 47 years. Median days to neutrophil and platelet engraftment after HSCT were 18 and 13 days respectively. Twenty-five patients experienced Acute GVHD and thirty-four had Chronic GVHD (12 mild and 22 extensive). Thirty-three patients were in grade 1, 17 in grade 2, 4 in grade 3 and 3 grade 4. As of their FLIPI score, 4, 14, 21 and 18 patients were calculated to have score of 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Forty-one patients are alive. Two patients have relapsed, one a year and the other two years after HSCT. The 5 year survival was 71.9% (95% CI 57.5\u201382.2%) and 5 year survival was 67.2% (95% CI 52.3\u201378.5%). Transplant related mortality rate (TRM) in 5 year was 22.4% (95% CI 63.6\u201386.8%). No significant differences was found among FLIPI groups 0,1,2 and 3 in terms of overall, relapse-free survival, TRM Allogeneic HSCT for patients with progressive follicular lymphoma is feasible and may result in prolonged disease-free survival.",
