    "abstract_text": "Abstract 241 Human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) possess hemangioblast activity, which is defined as the ability to generate both blood and endothelium. Whether malignant HSC counterparts such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) also display this bipotentiality remains to be defined. To test the hemangioblast potential of AML cells we first cultured primary human AML bone marrow in conditions established by Yoder and colleagues that support the growth of functional endothelial cell (EC) progenitors. AML cultured in endothelial colony forming cell (ECFC) media generated endothelial progenitor cell colonies that showed uptake of acetylated LDL and expressed several EC surface proteins, including CD105, CD146, UEA-1 and CD144. Importantly, ECFCs derived from AML bone marrow no longer expressed CD45 or myeloid surface proteins such as CD14. When placed in Matrigel, these AML derived ECFC generated capillary-like, tubular structures. Moreover, these ECFCs contained cytogenetic mutations associated with their parental leukemias. Thus, under the appropriate conditions, AML bone marrow cells can generate cells with an endothelial-like phenotype and harboring leukemia specific mutations that will be referred to as \u2018L-ECFC.' To functionally define leukemia hemangioblast activity, a xenograft model of AML was employed. Sublethally irradiated NOD/scid/IL2R\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 (NSG) mice were transplanted with primary human AML cells and then sacrificed at 8\u201336 weeks after transplant. Significant accumulations of human AML cells were found in perivascular regions of the liver. Both tight coupling and bona fide cell fusion between AML and ECs was observed. AML derived EC that were integrated into portal vein endothelium showed induction of CD105 expression Follow-up AML xenotransplant experiments with BrdU labeling revealed almost four-fold fewer (6%) of the AML cells incorporated within blood vessels were BrdU+, as compared to AML cells not integrated in blood vessels (22%) ( P =0.01). These results suggest that AML cell incorporation within the endovascular lining induces cell quiescence. Thus, leukemia-integrated ECs may be less susceptible to cell cycle active agents like cytarabine. Results from these experiments also raised the possibility that AML cells adopting an endothelial-like phenotype may serve as a reservoir for leukemic relapse. To test this hypothesis, we injected CD105+CD45- L-ECFC derived from AML patients into NSG mice. These L-ECFC generated colonies of human CD105+CD45- within spleens and bone marrow of recipient mice. We also found a distinct population of human CD45+CD19- cells comprising 5\u201310% of bone marrow cells. Leukemia-derived cells were confirmed by detection of cytogenetically mutant cells consistent with the parent leukemia (e.g., MLL duplications). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that AML cells can functionally generate leukemic ECs that become quiescent after incorporation in blood vessel networks and can re-emerge with a leukemogenic phenotype. Together, our results raise the strong possibility that AML cells exhibit functional hemangioblast activity and that vascular endothelium may serve as a clinically important sanctuary for occult leukemia. Our data also support endothelial cell targeting strategies as a means to eradicate AML. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
