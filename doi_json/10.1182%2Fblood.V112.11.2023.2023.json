    "abstract_text": "The product of thrombin digestion of fibrinogen, that is fibrin, binds to thrombin with high specificity. The latter interacts with two classes of binding sites on fibrin, one of low affinity in the E domain and the other of high affinity in the D domain of fibrin(ogen) molecules. Binding of thrombin to fibrinogen involves sequences of both A\u03b1 and B\u03b2 chain in the fibrinogen E domain. This recognition sites are still able to interact with thrombin after cleavage of fibrinopeptide A and B and form the low affinity binding site for the enzyme. The D domains contain a \u03b3 chain variant, termed \u03b3\u2032, arising from an alternative mRNA splicing, resulting in an elongated chain composed of 427 instead of 411 residues. The inserted region at the C-terminus is composed of 20 amino acids ( 408 VRPEHPAETEYDSLYPEDDL 427 ), rich of acidic residues. The \u03b3\u2032 chain, mainly heterodimerizes in the fibrinogen molecule with the more abundant \u03b3A chain, thus generating the \u03b3A/\u03b3\u2032 dimers (about 10% of the total \u03b3 chain content). The different expression of \u03b3\u2032 chain has been variably associated with both venous and arterial thrombosis. Previous genetic studies showed that the fibrinogen \u03b3-H2 haplotype is characterized by a reduced fibrinogen \u03b3\u2032 levels. This haplotype is associated with a significantly increased risk for venous thrombosis. At variance with venous thromboembolism, the effect of altered expression of \u03b3\u2032 chain on arterial thrombosis remains largely elusive and still debated. Biochemical studies showed that \u03b3\u2032 chains bind to \u03b1-thrombin with high affinity and that the 408-427 region of \u03b3\u2032 chain binds to the anion binding exosite (ABE)-II of thrombin. We can speculate that the fibrinogen \u03b3\u2032 chain, through its ability to bind to thrombin, might enhance the amount of clot-bound thrombin. The latter may represent a storage pool of the enzyme, facilitating arterial thrombus formation via platelet activation. In this study, we investigated the effect of the fibrinogen \u03b3\u2032 and of its 20-amino acid-insertion peptide on the thrombin interaction with the platelet receptors glycoprotein (Gp) Ib\u03b1, and protease-activated receptors PAR-1 and PAR-4, involved in platelet activation. Fragment D was used as the best surrogate to selectively study the high affinity binding site for thrombin in \u03b3 chain in a conformation similar to that present in the native fibrinogen molecule. Both synthetic \u03b3\u2032 peptide and fragment D*, containing the elongated \u03b3\u2032 chain, inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation up to 70%, with IC 50 values of 42\u00b13.5 \u03bcM and 0.47\u00b10.03 \u03bcM, respectively. Solid phase binding and titration spectrofluorimetric assays analyzing the tryptophan fluorescence of thrombin showed that both fragment D* and the synthetic \u03b3\u2032 peptide specifically bind to ABE-II of thrombin and competitively inhibit the thrombin interaction with GpIb\u03b1 with a mean K i \u22480.5 \u03bcM and \u224835 \u03bcM, respectively. HPLC assays showed that both the \u03b3\u2032 chain allosterically inhibited thrombin cleavage of the synthetic PAR-1 38-60 peptide, with an IC 50 value of 45 \u03bcM, in good agreement with the K d value of thrombin binding to \u03b3\u2032 chain derived from fluorimetric titrations. Likewise, flow cytometry studies showed that the hydrolysis of native PAR-1 molecules on intact platelets was progressively inhibited by increasing concentrations of both fragment D* and \u03b3\u2032 peptide, while PAR-4 cleavage was unaffected. In summary, fibrinogen \u03b3\u2032 chain binds with high affinity to thrombin and inhibits with combined mechanisms the thrombin-induced platelet activation. The role of different expression of \u03b3\u2032 chain in circulating fibrinogen may variably influence the thrombotic and hemorrhagic manifestations in different clinical settings or different phases of thrombotic diseases.",
