    "abstract_text": "HLA-DR \u03b21* 0405 has been implicated in various autoimmune disorders including autoimmune hepatitis (Qiu DK et al, J Gastroenterol Hepatol 2003). T cell clones with HLA-DR \u03b21* 0405 restricted stem cell toxicity has been demonstrated in patients with aplastic anemia (Nakao S et al, Blood 1997). We report a patient with acute non viral hepatitis and aplastic anemia who has HLA-DR \u03b21* 0405 genotype which she shared with her HLA matched sibling who was diagnosed to have autoimmune hepatitis. Case Report: A 23 year old South Asian lady presented in July of 2012 with acute hepatitis. Her liver function tests (LFTs) showed a total bilirubin of 9.8mg/dl, and aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase(ALT) of 1815 and 2327 U/L respectively. Screening for known acute hepatitis causing viruses was negative. She had no significant history of exposure to any drugs or toxins other than a three day course of ciprofloxacin two weeks earlier. Liver biopsy showed evidence of active hepatitis with chronic lymphocytic infiltrates in the portal triads and small areas of hepatic necrosis with neutrophilic infiltrates. She also had pancytopenia with hemoglobin (Hb) of 10.1 g/dl, white blood count (WBC) of 3.1 X10 3 /mm 3 with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 2.1 X10 3 /mm 3 and platelet count of 7 X10 3 /mm 3 . Bone marrow exam confirmed a hypocellular marrow with 10% cellularity. She was treated with high dose steroids with improvement of her liver function tests. Her cytopenias worsened and she was transferred to our tertiary care center for further management. At admission her WBC was 0.9 X10 3 /mm 3 with ANC of 0.1 X10 3 /mm 3 , Hb of 10.1 g/dl and platelet count of 21 X 10 3 /mm 3 (after tranfusional support). A repeat bone marrow exam showed a marrow with 95 % donor chimerism and was negative for anti-smooth muscle and anti-mitochondrial antibody screening. Patient is now 18 months post transplant and is off all immune suppression with normal blood counts, renal function and liver function tests. Conclusion: HLA-DR\u03b21* 0405 restricted autoimmune T-cells may have a role to play in the pathogenesis of acute hepatitis and associated aplastic anemia. A successful bone marrow transplant could be carried out in a patient with hepatitis with aplastic anemia from HLA matched sibling donor with autoimmune hepatitis after the donor had received treatment with steroids.
