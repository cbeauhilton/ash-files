    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B-cell malignancy stratified in part by cytogenetic aberrations including the high-risk copy number alterations (CNAs) of 17p- and +1q21. CNAs of 1q21 are known to occur as a result of jumping translocations of 1q (JT1q12) which increase the copy number (CN) of 1q21, while at the same time causing collateral genomic damage including deletions and amplifications in some receptor chromosomes (RC). We have previously reported the decondensation of the 1q12 region and triradial chromosomes in the bone marrow specimens of patients with aggressive disease, and have speculated that hypomethylation of the pericentromeric region of 1q12 may play a role in the origin of 1q21 CNAs. To test the hypothesis that 1q12 hypomethylation induces CN gains of 1q21, we used the hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine to treat blood lymphocyte cultures of five myeloma patients with balanced constitutional 1q12 aberrations as well as five normal control subjects. The patients with constitutional aberrations of 1q12 were selected based on their potential to show either novel CN gains of regions translocated distal to 1q12 or CN gains of 1q21 when 1q12 was translocated to a non-homologous chromosome. The constitutional aberrations included two patients with pericentromeric inversions of chromosome 1 inv(1)(p11q12), and one patient each with a balanced translocation of t(1;2)(q12;p11), t(1;2)(q12;q34), or t(1;9)(q12;q11). These particular aberrations should provide a unique model for testing the association between the hypomethylation of 1q12 and the origin of CN gains of 1q21. In vitro blood lymphocyte cultures of patients and controls were treated for 72 hours with 5-azacytidine at a final concentration of 10uM. 5-azacytidine is known to cause site-specific hypomethylation and chromatin decondensation in the 1q12 region. Utilizing FISH probes for 1q12 (satII/III) and 1q21(CKS1B), we analyzed 100 metaphase cells from each patient and each control for CN gains for 1q21 and any novel region translocated distal to 1q12. To fully characterize the induced rearrangements of 1q12, we also applied inverse G-banding and spectral karyotyping in selected cells. Remarkably, all patients with the balanced constitutional 1q12 rearrangements showed CN gains of chromosome regions on the derivative chromosomes distal to the inverted or translocated 1q12 regions. Recurring aberrations of 1q12 included pericentromeric decondensation and triradials of chromosome arms 1q, 1p, and 2p, in addition to localized pulverizations distal to 1q12 of these same arms. Specifically, in both patients with inv(1), whole-arm CN gains of 1p were identified in 2-3% of cells, while in the patient with t(1;2)(q12;p11), whole-arm gains of 2p ( MYCN ) were identified in 3% of cells. In these same three patients, on the derivative chromosomes where the 1q12 region was separated from 1q21 by an inversion or translocation, no CN gains of the 1q21 occurred. In the patients with 1q12 translocated to a non-homologous chromosome, 1q21 was amplified on the RC in 4% of the cells in the patient with t(1;2)(q12;q34), and in 3% in the patient with t(1;9)(q12;q11). Control subjects showed CN gains of 1q21on both chromosomes 1 in the range of 3-13%. Whole-arm JT1q12s to RC16q were identified in three patients and three controls. This JT1q12 results in a CN gain of 1q21, and a whole-arm CN loss in RC16q, identical to those found in the bone marrow specimens of MM patients. Interestingly, one control showed JT1q12s to two different RCs, 9q and 12q, causing whole-arm deletions in the long arms of both. The key structural aberration responsible for the generation of CN gains of 1q21 and subsequent JT1q12s is the formation of a triradial involving the 1q12 region. The novel finding in this study is the induction of triradials and CN gains for chromosome arms of 1p and 2p, which demonstrates that epigenetic modifications to 1q12 can amplify non-homologous chromosome regions juxtaposed to it. Furthermore, the CN gains induced here occurred only distal to 1q12 on all normal and derivative chromosomes and mimic the triradials and JT1q12s reported in the bone marrow of patients with aggressive disease. These findings demonstrate for the first time that the hypomethylation of the 1q12 region can potentially amplify any genomic region distal to it, and provide evidence for an epigenetic origin of the high-risk 1q21 CNAs found in the progression of MM.
