    "abstract_text": "Background: Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) is a rare lymphoma entity accounting for approximately 5% of all Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) cases. Pathological and clinical characteristics differ from classical HL (cHL). In contrast to cHL, the malignant cells in NLPHL are consistently positive for CD20 but stain negative for CD30. The clinical course of NLPHL is usually indolent and patients present with early-stage disease more frequently than in cHL. Patients and Methods: We investigated characteristics and outcomes of 85 patients with NLPHL (stage IB and stage II without risk factors) who had treatment within the randomized German Hodgkin Study Group HD16 study for early-stage HL. Results were compared to those from 495 cHL patients (stage IB and stage II without risk factors) treated within the same study. Patients were randomized between standard treatment consisting of 2 cycles of ABVD followed by consolidation radiotherapy and treatment guided by interim positron emission tomography after 2 cycles of ABVD (PET-2). PET-2-guided treatment consisted of 2 cycles of ABVD alone for patients with a negative PET-2 and 2 cycles of ABVD followed by consolidation radiotherapy for patients with a positive PET-2 (defined as a Deauville score \u2265 3). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method including 95%-confidence intervals (95%-CI) and hazard ratios (HR) obtained from Cox regression models. Analyses were performed descriptively. Results: Overall, 62/85 NLPHL patients (73%) were male as compared to 254/495 cHL patients (51%) (p=0.0002). The median age was 37 years (range: 19-71 years) among patients with NLPHL and 36 years (range: 18-75 years) among patients with cHL (p=0.4380). Information on the histopathological growth pattern was available for 67/85 NLPHL patients of which 44 (66%) had a typical growth pattern. The PET-2 was positive in 39/85 NLPHL patients (46%) and in 171/495 cHL patients (35%) (p=0.0507). After a median observation time of 64 months, the 5-year PFS was 90.3% (95%-CI: 83.8-96.7%) for all 85 NLPHL patients and 90.8% (95%-CI: 88.1-93.5%) for all 495 cHL patients (HR=1.1; 95%-CI: 0.5-2.1). The 5-year PFS rates for PET-2-positive NLPHL (n=39) and cHL (n=171) patients were 89.3% (95%-CI: 79.4-99.2%) and 91.6% (95%-CI: 87.2-96%) (HR= 1.3; 95%-CI: 0.5-3.5), respectively. The 5-year PFS rates for PET-2-negative NLPHL (n=46) and cHL (n=324) patients were 91% (95%-CI: 82.7-99.4%) and 90.4% (95%-CI: 87-99.4%) (HR=0.85; 95%-CI: 0.3-2.4), respectively. PET-2-negative NLPHL (n=25) and cHL (n=152) patients treated with 2 cycles of ABVD alone had 5-year PFS rates of 83% (95%-CI: 67.8-98.2%) and 88.2% (95%-CI: 82.7-93.6%) (HR=1.5, 95%-CI: 0.5-4.5), respectively. In contrast, PET-2-negative NLPHL (n=21) and cHL (n=172) patients treated with 2 cycles of ABVD followed by consolidation radiotherapy had 5-year PFS rates of 100% and 92.3% (95%-CI: 88.1-96.5%) (HR=0; 95%-CI: 0), respectively. NLPHL patients with a typical growth pattern (n=44) had a 5-year PFS of 95.2% (95%-CI: 88.8-100%) whereas patients with an atypical growth pattern (n=23) had a 5-year PFS of 82.2% (95%-CI: 66.3-98%) (HR=2.5; 95%-CI: 0.5-11.2). A total of 9 NLPHL patients experienced disease progression or relapse during follow-up. The median time to NLPHL recurrence was 14 months (range: 1-89 months). There were 2 cases of second primary malignancies (1 case of malignant melanoma, 1 case of stomach cancer) among patients with NLPHL. No patient developed histological transformation into aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The 5-year OS rates were 100% and 98.6% (95%-CI: 97.5-99.7%) (HR=0; 95%-CI: 0) for patients with NLPHL and cHL, respectively. Conclusion: Taken together, the 5-year outcomes for patients with newly diagnosed early-stage NLPHL were similar to their counterparts with cHL. Thus, the current standard of care for early-stage cHL consisting of 2 cycles of ABVD followed by consolidation radiotherapy represents a highly active option also for the treatment of patients with the initial diagnosis of stage IB and stage II NLPHL without risk factors.
