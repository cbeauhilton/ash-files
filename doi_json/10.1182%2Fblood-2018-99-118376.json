    "abstract_text": "Introduction Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a cancer entity of minimal mutational load and low immunogenicity. The interaction of ALL cells with bone marrow (BM) T cells has not been investigated as a pathogenic driver or prognostic marker for pediatric ALL. We defined BM T cells of pediatric ALL patients as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and investigated the prognostic relevance of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory signals between ALL and BM T cells. Methods BM samples of 100 pediatric ALL patients were analyzed at time of initial diagnosis. T-cell subpopulations and expression of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules were defined by flow cytometry and correlated with clinical outcome of the patients. To investigate the role of TIM-3 for the interaction between T cells and leukemic cells, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated TIM-3 knockout (KO) was performed in primary T cells by ribonucleoprotein electroporation. T-cell activation and proliferation after contact with leukemic target cells were analyzed in TIM-3 KO cells and compared to wildtype T cells and T cells with retroviral TIM-3 overexpression. Interaction of T cells with leukemic target cells was induced by addition of anti-CD19/-CD3 bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE). Fold change (FC) of T-cell activation and proliferation was analyzed before and after co-culture. BM expression levels of known TIM-3 inducers were identified by RNA next generation sequencing of the bone marrow samples. Results Multivariate analyses identified high TIM-3 expression on CD4 + BM T cells at initial diagnosis as strong predictor for relapse of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (relapse free survival (RFS) 94.6% vs. 70.3%). The risk to develop ALL relapse was 7.1-fold higher in the group of TIM-3 high expressing patients (n=37) compared to TIM-3 low expressing patients (n=37). Expression levels of known TIM-3 ligands and inducers in the bone marrow of the patients were analyzed by RNA next generation sequencing and compared between patients with high TIM-3 expression (n=12) and low TIM-3 expression (n=15) on BM T cells. Presence of known TIM-3 ligands HMGB1 (High-Mobility-Group-Protein B1) and Galectin-9 was confirmed, but expression levels did not show significant differences. Known TIM-3 inducers IL-2, -7, -15 and -21 were not expressed on RNA level indicating that another mechanism must be responsible for TIM-3 overexpression. In vitro experiments showed that the interaction with leukemic cells induces TIM-3 expression on the surface of T cells (mean TIM-3 expression 51.1% vs. 29.7% on T cells with vs. without addition of leukemic cells, n=3). To investigate the functional relevance of TIM-3 expression in pediatric leukemia, TIM-3 KO and overexpression was performed on primary T cells. TIM-3 KO T cells showed higher activation levels after co-culture with leukemic cell lines plus CD3-/CD19-specific BiTE compared to wildtype (WT) T cells (FC of CD69 surface expression 5.0 vs. 3.2, n=3). FC of anti-leukemic proliferation was impaired in TIM-3 overexpressing T cells compared to WT T cells (FC 1.6 vs. 2.3, n=3) whereas TIM-3 KO T cells showed a higher proliferation FC compared to controls (FC 6.5 vs. 2.4, n=3). Conclusions Our study identifies TIM-3 expression on CD4 + bone marrow T cells at initial diagnosis as a strong predictor for pediatric ALL relapse. TIM-3 expression is induced by interaction of T cells with leukemic cells and results in impaired anti-leukemic T-cell activation and proliferation. TIM-3-mediated T-cell inhibition represents a new mechanism of impaired immune surveillance in pediatric ALL and blockade of this axis may be of importance for future immunotherapy in ALL.
