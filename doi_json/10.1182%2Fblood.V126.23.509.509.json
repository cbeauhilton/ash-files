    "abstract_text": "Background: Isatuximab (SAR650984) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds selectively to a unique epitope on the human CD38 receptor. In the dose escalation part of the Phase I portion of the trial (NCT01749969), isatuximab \u226510 mg/kg IV given every other week (q2w) or 10 mg/kg weekly (qw) induced responses in 6/19 recipients (ORR 32%). Responses were noted at doses as low as 1 mg/kg q2w. The maximum tolerated dose (up to 20 mg/kg IV qw) was not reached. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were fatigue and nausea; few serious grade 3/4 TEAEs were reported (pneumonia 6%). The most common category of drug-related TEAE involved infusion-associated reactions (IARs) occurring in half of the patients, with grade 3/4 IARs in <5% of the patients. Based on promising Phase I activity, a Phase II dose finding study was added to investigate single-agent isatuximab in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma (RRMM). Methods: In Phase II, eligible patients were originally randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of 3 treatment groups: 3 mg/kg q2w, 10 mg/kg q2w, and 10 mg/kg q2w x 4 doses then q4w. A 4 th treatment group was enrolled at a higher isatuximab dose with an optimized schedule of 20 mg/kg qw x 4 doses then q2w. Patient assignment was stratified by prior anti-myeloma therapy (Stratum 1: prior treatment with pomalidomide (POM) and/or carfilzomib (CAR); Stratum 2: no prior POM or CAR). Patients continued therapy until disease progression, unacceptable AEs or physician/patient decision. Eligible patients had measurable disease (serum M-protein >1 g/dL or urine M-protein \u2265200 mg/24 h, or serum free light chain \u226510 mg/dL), prior exposure to \u22653 lines of anti-myeloma therapy or were double-refractory to immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and proteasome inhibitors (PIs), prior treatment with an alkylating agent, and adequate baseline bone marrow reserve and organ function. Enrollment of 24 patients was planned for each treatment group. An interim efficacy analysis is planned when all patients have completed \u22652 disease assessments, with central review of these data currently ongoing. Enrollment has now been completed and all patients who completed at least 1 cycle of isatuximab at the cutoff date (5/29/15) are included in this preliminary analysis. Results: Patient characteristics (n=96): median age 62.5 yrs (range 38-85); median time from initial diagnosis to study treatment 5.85 yrs (1.2-24.1); 76% had IgA/G MM; 24% had light-chain only disease; and 22%, 22%, and 44% had Stage I, II, and III disease, respectively. The median number of prior lines of therapy was 5 (2-14) with 100%, 99%, and 98% having prior exposure to PIs, IMiDs, and alkylator-containing therapy, respectively. Overall, 78% of patients had previously received POM and/or CAR; 55% had been exposed to both of these agents. At data cut-off, 36.5% of patients remained on therapy and 53.1%, 6.3%, and 4.2% had discontinued therapy due to disease progression, AEs, or other reason, respectively. The median number of cycles received was 3 (1-9), with a median duration of treatment of 11.7 wks. Approximately 17% of patients required at least 1 dose delay and 7.3% of isatuximab infusions were interrupted. TEAEs occurred in 93% of patients, with 51% being grade \u22653. Drug-related TEAEs occurred in 61% of patients (grade \u22653, 10%). The most common drug-related TEAEs (>5% of patients) were nausea (14.6%), chills (14.6%), dyspnea (13.5%), chest discomfort (10.4%), flushing (7.3%), headache (7.3%), cough (6.3%), and vomiting (5.2%). The majority of the symptoms occurred within 24 h of isatuximab infusion and were attributed to an IAR. IARs occurred in 50% of patients, were predominantly grade 1/2 (grade \u22653, 3.1%), and were mostly limited to Cycle 1 (2 patients had IARs in Cycle 2). Pneumonia (6.3%) and sepsis (5.2%) were the most common serious TEAEs. Six deaths have occurred within 30 days of last dose, 4 due to disease progression, and 2 due to serious AEs unrelated to study therapy (cardiopulmonary arrest and cerebral hemorrhage). Conclusion : Isatuximab administered to heavily pre-treated patients with RRMM appears well tolerated. IARs are common in Cycle 1, but typically do not recur. Results by treatment arm, including interim analysis response data, will be presented. Disclosures Martin: Sanofi: Research Funding.
