    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy and prognosis of currently popular treatments for patients with transfusion-dependent non-severe aplastic anemia (TD-NSAA). METHODS: Medical records of patients with TD-NSAA were collected from three hospitals and divided into four groups based on their treatment. Treatment efficacy was evaluated at 6 months after treatment, with subgroup analysis based on patients' disease courses. Adverse events and 3-year survival status were also reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 175 patients' records were collected in this study. The analysis of treatment efficacy indicated that the most effective treatment was allo-hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) with the response rate of 84.62%, which was followed by Anti thymocyte globulin and ciclosporin A (ATG + CsA) (68.52%), CsA + androgen (26.92%), and androgen (0%), respectively. The subgroup analysis showed that for patients with less than 6-month disease courses, ATG + CsA treatment could achieve similar response rate as allo-HSCT (84.00%). Besides, ATG + CsA showed better efficacy than CsA + androgen in all stratified arms (P<0.05). Three-year event-free survival rates were higher in patients treated with ATG + CsA (83.3%) than with CsA + androgen (64.4%) (P=0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, we concluded that ATG+ CsA could achieve better efficacy to treat TS-NSAA than did CsA+ androgen. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
