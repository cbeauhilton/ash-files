    "abstract_text": "Introduction Myeloproliferative Neoplasms can shorten the life of patients and affect severely their quality of life as a result of constitutional symptoms mediated by cytokines and from massive splenomegaly characteristic of these diseases. The objective measurement of symptoms in Myelofibrosis is essential for the presence of general constitutional symptoms as fatigue and is considered adverse prognostic value for survival. The systematic measurement of symptoms in Myelofibrosis is essential for assessing the outcome of treatment with JAK-2 inhibitors. Material and Methods To assess the impact on quality of life in patients with Myeloproliferative Neoplasms treated with the inhibitor Ruxolitinib, there was applied the questionnaire Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (Mesa et al. Leukemia Research. 2009: 33; 1199-1203) to 16 patients included in the Compassionate Use of Ruxolitinib Program: 8 men and 8 women were included with a median age of 63 years; 4 patients with primary Myelofibrosis, 3 with Myelofibrosis post Polycitemia vera and 9 with Myelofibrosis post essential Thrombocythemia. The median patient follow-up was 9 months. The patients started with a dose of 20 mg Ruxolitinib orally every 12 hours. Results The questionnaire was administered to all patients at each visit and the results of the ratings of the patients were presented as median of each answer at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months of follow-up ( table 1 ). By comparing the differences of each parameter measured between the start and at 3, 6 and 12 months were statistically significant for all variables (P <0.001, CI: 95%). The most significant changes were observed when comparing data at baseline and follow-up to the maximum time, however were obvious from the first quarter of observation on fatigue and symptoms dependent splenomegaly in most general symptoms, which actually disappeared completely after 3 months of treatment and not relapsed during the track and in the perception of the quality of life of patients. The variables with lower proportional change recorded were general activity, mood, walking tolerance and everyday work. Table 1 Results at Baseline and 3, 6 and 12 Months of Treatment    View Large Discussion and conclusions The treatment of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms with Ruxolitinib represents a major advance in the management of malignant Myeloproliferative and achieved excellent improvement in overall constitutional symptom control, splenomegaly and the general perception of the quality of life of these patients. The objective measurement of symptoms of Myelofibrosis is essential, since the presence of general constitutional symptoms as fatigue is considered adverse prognostic value for survival and systematic measurement of symptoms in Myelofibrosis is essential for assessing the outcome of treatment with inhibitors JAK-2.
