    "abstract_text": "Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) results from alloreactive donor derived T cells attacking targets in the gastrointestinal tract, liver and skin. We observed the initiation and rapid kinetics of aGVHD in a murine model [FVB/N (H-2q) into irradiated Balb/c (H-2d)] using in vivo bioluminescence imaging. The transition from the initiation to the effector phase of aGVHD (day 3\u20134) was characterized by rapid T cell proliferation and upregulation of gut homing receptors alpha4beta7, alphaEbeta7 and CCR9 on alloreactive T cells in Peyer\u2019s patches (PP), mesenteric lymph nodes (LN) and spleen, but not peripheral LNs. Therefore we asked whether the lack of specific lymphoid priming sites would lead to decreased alloreactive T cell infiltration in the gut compared to the liver and skin. Using PP deficient mice, we observed that mesenteric LN and spleen compensate for the lack of PP as alloreactive priming sites. Transplantation of PP and LN deficient mice (TNFalpha-/-) showed that the spleen alone was sufficient to cause the complete profile of aGVHD with a time course similar to that of wildtype mice. Splenectomized mice with intact secondary lymphoid organs also developed aGVHD. Strikingly, treatment of splenectomized recipients with blocking antibodies against the lymphoid homing receptors L-selectin and MAdCAM-1 prevented GVHD with 100% survival (>120 d, p<0.0001). Our study shows that multiple priming sites are involved in GVHD initiation, the spleen compensating for the lack of PP and mesenteric LN, and vice versa. In contrast, splenectomy and antibody blocking resulted in a clear survival benefit for all recipients.",
