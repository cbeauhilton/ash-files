This analysis aimed to describe the first-line management of bleeding in AH within Europe. Methods. Data from the EACH2 registry, a multicentre, international, web-based registry, were used to analyze the use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa), activated prothrombin complex concentrates (APCC), FVIII concentrates, and DDAVP as first line hemostatic therapy. There was no predefined treatment protocol, each center was free to follow local clinical practice. Response rate is the number of bleeds resolved as judged by each investigator. Data on demographics, pregnancy and immunosuppression will be presented in other abstracts. Data are given as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) or odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results. Data of 501 patients (pts) (235 male, 266 female, median age 74 years (range 14\u2013104)) were prospectively collected between 2003 and 2009 in 90 centers of 11 European countries. In 474 pts at least one bleeding episode is reported; 159 pts had 2 episodes (the second bleeding episode a median 26 (13/67) days after the first), 51 pts had 3 episodes, 16 pts. more than 3 bleedings. Of the 474 initial bleeding episodes, 70.3% were reported as severe (criteria prospectively defined), 50.2% had deep musculoskeletal or retroperitoneal bleeding, 53.2% skin hematomas, 31.6% mucosal bleeding, and only 4.9% hemarthroses. In 77.4% the bleedings occurred spontaneous, 8.4% after trauma, 8.2% after surgery. Median FVIII activity at the time of bleeding was 0.02 U/mL (0.01/0.05 U/mL), the inhibitor titer 19 BU/mL (5.5/64 BU/mL). There was no significant association between FVIII activity or inhibitor titer and severity of bleeding. Hemostatic therapy was given in 70.5% of the bleedings. First line therapy is presented in the table: Table: First line hemostatic therapy  Substance . n (%) . initial dose . duration . total dose . rFVIIa 170 (50.9%) 90 (85/103) mcg/kg 4 (2/10) days 90 (25/235) mg APCC 64 (19.2%) 67 (54/81) U/kg 5 (2/10) days 30 (12/57) \u00d7 1000 U FVIII conc. 60 (18%) 50 (40/76) U/kg 4 (1/6) days 20 (9/50) \u00d7 1000 U Substance . n (%) . initial dose . duration . total dose . rFVIIa 170 (50.9%) 90 (85/103) mcg/kg 4 (2/10) days 90 (25/235) mg APCC 64 (19.2%) 67 (54/81) U/kg 5 (2/10) days 30 (12/57) \u00d7 1000 U FVIII conc. 60 (18%) 50 (40/76) U/kg 4 (1/6) days 20 (9/50) \u00d7 1000 U View Large Desmopressin was given in 6%, antifibrinolytic drugs in 18%, and high dose immunoglobulin infusions in 11.1%; immunoadsorption was performed in 5.4%, plasmapheresis in 0.6%. Overall bleeding resolved in 76.4%, in median after 4 days (IQR 2\u201310 days). Second line therapy with an alternative substance was applied in 23.6% (in 17.4% because bleeding did not resolve). The use of bypassing agents (rFVIIa or APCC) resulted in a significant higher rate of bleeding control (91.2 %) than the use of FVIII or desmopressin (71.0 %) (p<0.001), there was no difference between rFVIIa (90.9 %) and APCC (94.3 %). To minimize bias, propensity score matched data analysis (1) based on age, gender, FVIII level, inhibitor titre, hemoglobin level, site, severity and cause of bleeding was carried out. It confirmed that first line treatment with a bypassing agent resulting in a better control of bleeding compared to FVIII or desmopressin (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.12\u20130.53; p=0.004). There was no difference in efficacy between rFVIIa and APCC (OR 1.0, 95%CI 0.24\u20134.18). No other patient- or disease-related parameters affected response rate. Deaths due to bleeding occurred in 3% of the patients, only few serious adverse events were recorded: 1.4% myocardial infarction, 0.2% stroke, 1.0% venous thromboembolic events. There was no significant association of death or severe adverse events with a specific hemostatic therapy. Conclusion. Bypassing agents are the preferred first line hemostatic therapy in AH (70.1% of the episodes) and have a significantly better efficacy than FVIII or DDAVP; rFVIIa was the agent preferred by most clinicians (~50%), rFVIIa and APCC were equally efficacious. Treatment with bypassing agents was safe and highly effective in controlling bleeding in AH. 1.
