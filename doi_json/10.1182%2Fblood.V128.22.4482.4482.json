    "abstract_text": "Introduction A unique biological characteristic of MM plasma cells (PCs) is the substantial production of immunoglobulin proteins. This process requires disulfide bond formations that in turn generate large amounts of H 2 O 2 . The Trx-TrxR reductase system exists to combat this oxidative stress; however, cytotoxicity can occur when the cells' antioxidative capacity is overwhelmed. Recently, we demonstrated that IMiDs inhibit peroxidase-mediated decomposition of H 2 O 2 , and that lenalidomide sensitivity in MM correlates with the degree of antioxidative capacity ( Sebastian et al. 2015 ASH ). In this study we sought to better understand this inhibitory process. Methods We used various human MM cell lines with different sensitivity to lenalidomide. Cell viability was assessed by the MTT assay. Antioxidative capacity was measured via the total cellular oxidation of reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(P)H) after H 2 O 2 treatment. A CRBN CRISPR/Cas9 KO plasmid was used to generate CRBN knockout cells and lentivirus system was used to over-express CRBN in MM cells. Results We found that IMiDs inhibit TrxR mediated intracellular H\u2082O\u2082 decomposition in a CRBN dependent fashion. Unlike lenalidomide, the direct TrxR inhibitor auranofin was very effective in inducing cell death in MM cell lines, in a CRBN independent fashion. By using MM.1R isogeneic cells with and without CRBN, and the CRBN-overexpressing OCIMY-5 cell line (transfected with wt-CRBN) we showed that auranofin treatment caused cytotoxicity irrespective of CRBN level of expression, while lenalidomide was only effective in CRBN expressing cells. Clinically achievable concentrations of auranofin treatment induced cell signals similar to lenalidomide, including degradation of IKZF1, IKZF3. As with lenalidomide, the sensitivity of CRBN expressing cell lines to auranofin correlated with their basal antioxidative capacity (MM.1S cells are sensitive and have with lower anti-oxidative capacity while RPMI-8226 is resistant due to its high anti-oxidative capacity). We also found that targeting Trx (downstream effector of TrxR) with the direct inhibitor PX12 overcame this cellular anti-oxidative capacity and inhibited cell proliferation in both RPMI-8226 and MM.1S in a CRBN independent fashion. Combination of auranofin with bortezomib showed a synergistic effect, but only in cells with lower anti-oxidative capacity. In contrast, PX-12, showed a synergistic effect with bortezomib in all analyzed MM cells lines, irrespective of their anti-oxidative capacity and CRBN expression. Conclusions IMiDs inhibit TrxR-mediated intracellular H 2 O 2 decomposition in CRBN expressing MM. While the direct TrxR inhibitor, auranofin, bypassed the CRBN requirement for inducing cytotoxicity in MM, its cytotoxic effect could be overcome by the cells antioxidative capacity. Direct Trx inhibition (such as PX-12) seems like a potent strategy for MM therapy to overcome cellular CRBN requirements and higher anti-oxidative capacity cells.
