Chen, M. Sue Leffell, Marianna Zahurak, Kathy Schultz, Heather Karaszkiewicz, Leo Luznik, Javier Bolanos-Meade, Yvette Kasamon, Lode Swinnen, Douglas Gladstone, Richard J. Jones, Ephraim J. Fuchs Historically, myeloablative BMT using T cell-replete bone marrow from partially HLA-mismatched (HLA-haploidentical) related donors has been associated with excessive rates of severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and non-relapse mortality (NRM). Based upon promising clinical outcomes using high dose, post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (Cy) as GVHD prophylaxis after non-myeloablative, HLA-haploidentical BMT(Luznik, BBMT 2008;14:641) or after myeloablative, HLA-matched BMT (Luznik, Blood 2010;115(16):3224), we evaluated the safety and efficacy of high-dose, posttransplantation Cy after myeloablative conditioning and T cell-replete, HLA-haploidentical BMT for advanced and refractory hematologic malignancies. Seventeen patients (median age 40, range 13\u201364; 7 AML, 1 bilineage leukemia, 2 CML, 6 NHL, 1 grey zone lymphoma) have been enrolled, the majority (88%) of whom were not in remission at the time of transplant. Conditioning consisted of IV Busulfan (pharmacokinetically adjusted) on days -6 to -3, Cy (50mg/kg/day) on days -2 and -1 in sixteen patients or Cy (50mg/kg/day) on days -5 and -4 and total body irradiation (300cGy /day) on days -3 to 0 in one patient, followed by T-cell replete bone marrow in all patients. Postgrafting immunosuppression consisted of Cy (50 mg/kg/day) on days 3 and 4, mycophenolate mofetil for 35 days, and tacrolimus for 6 months in all patients. Donor T-cell engraftment occurred in all evaluable patients (n=13). The median times to neutrophil (>500/\u03bc L) and platelet recovery (>20,000/\u03bc L) are 24 days (range, 17\u201344 days) and 22 days (range, 13\u201391 days), respectively. On competing risk analysis, the cumulative incidences of grades II-IV and grades III-IV acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) at day 100 are 24% (95% CI: 7%, 46%) and 12.5% (95% CI: 1.8, 33.9%), respectively ( Figure a ). On competing risk analysis, the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) at one year is 14.7% (95% CI: 0.76, 47.1%). On competing risk analysis, the cumulative incidence of NRM at 100 days is 18% (95% CI: 4%, 39%) ( Figure b ). NRMs were due to multi-organ system failure in two patients with bulky mediastinal lymphoma and veno-occlusive disease in one patient who had received gemtuzumab ozogamicin 3 weeks prior to BMT. There have been no infectious deaths to date. On competing risk analysis, the cumulative incidence of relapse at 100 days is 29% (95% CI: 10%, 52%) in this poor-risk cohort. With a median follow-up of 10.1 months (range 5.3\u201312.8 months) in those without events, actuarial overall survival (OS) is 58% at 6 months and 37% at one year and actuarial event-free survival (EFS) is 22% at 6 months and 14% at one year. Myeloablative HLA-haploidentical BMT with T cell replete bone marrow and posttransplantation Cy is associated with promising rates of engraftment, GVHD, and NRM that do not appear substantially different than that seen with non-myeloablative haploidentical BMT with posttransplantation Cy or with myeloablative matched BMT. Based on these data, this approach is being moved into better risk patients. View large Download slide View large Download slide  Disclosures: Kasamon: Genentech: Research Funding.
