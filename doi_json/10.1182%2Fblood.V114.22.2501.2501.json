One of the potential benefits of treatment would be to improve the child's health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Patients and Methods: Variables including age, sex, type of ITP(acute versus chronic), treatment (observation, IVIG, Anti-D, and prednisone), platelet count and country of origin were analysed by multiple regression to determine their relationship to HRQoL as measured by the Kid's ITP Tools (KIT) child self-report version. Results: 77 children from Uruguay (n=15), France (n=25), Germany (n=13) and the UK (n=24) self-completed the KIT. Mean platelet counts were: 6 for acute ITP patients (mean age 8.6 yrs) and 30 for chronic patients (mean age of 10.8 years). KIT scores by type of ITP and country are shown in the Figure . Multiple regression found that only the type of ITP (p=0.04) and the country of origin (p=0.029) were significantly associated with the KIT scores. Age, sex, platelet count and treatment were not correlated with KIT scores (p>0.16). Conclusion: The method of treatment did not have a significant impact on child-reported HRQoL. However, differences in HRQoL scores were found between acute and chronic groups and by country of origin.
