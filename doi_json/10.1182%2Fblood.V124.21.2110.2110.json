    "abstract_text": "Introduction : a formal comparison between Lenalidomide-Dexamethasone (Rd) and Lenalidomide-Prednisone plus Melphalan (MPR) or Cyclophosphamide (CPR) has not been performed yet. We compared Rd vs. MPR vs. CPR in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients \u226565 years old in a multicenter phase III trial. Per protocol, upfront dose reductions of Dexamethasone, Melphalan and Cyclophosphamide were performed, according to patients age ( \u226475 years vs. >75 years). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Methods : 662 patients with NDMM were randomized to receive nine 28-day cycles of Rd (n=222), MPR (n=218) or CPR (n=222). Rd: lenalidomide 25 mg/day for 21 days; dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1,8,15,22 in patients 65-75 years old and 20 mg in those >75 years; MPR: lenalidomide 10 mg/day for 21 days; melphalan orally 0.18 mg/Kg for 4 days in patients 65-75 years old and 0.13 mg/Kg in patients >75 years; prednisone 1.5 mg/Kg for 4 days; CPR: lenalidomide 25 mg/day for 21 days; cyclophosphamide orally 50 mg/day for 21 days in patients 65-75 years old and 50 mg every other day in patients >75 years; prednisone 25 mg every other day. After induction, patients were randomized to receive maintenance with lenalidomide alone (R) or with prednisone (RP). Results : Patients characteristics were well balanced. Eighty-three (37%) patients in the Rd, 86 (39%) in the MPR and 80 (36%) in the CPR groups were older than 75 years. In intention to treat analysis, after a median follow-up of 31 months, no difference in PFS and overall survival (OS) was observed. Median PFS was 23 months in Rd, 27 months in MPR and 23 months in CPR (Rd vs MPR p=0.216; Rd vs CPR p=0.872; MPR vs CPR p=0.148). Median OS was not reached and was 73% in Rd, 67% in MPR and 72% in CPR at 3 years (Rd vs MPR p=0.663; Rd vs CPR p=0.754; MPR vs CPR p=0.448). A subgroup analysis, according to age was performed. No difference in response rate was observed. In patients \u226475 years, median PFS was 23 in Rd, 30 in MPR and 23 months in CPR (Rd vs MPR, p<0.04; Rd vs CPR p=0.897; MPR vs CPR, p<0.05). Median OS was not reached and was 75% in Rd, 76% in MPR, 77% in CPR at 3 years (Rd vs MPR p=0.251; Rd vs CPR p=0.280; MPR vs CPR p=0.975). In patients >75 years, no PFS difference was noticed: median PFS was 22 in Rd, 18 in MPR, 21 months in CPR (Rd vs MPR p=0.572; Rd vs CPR p=0.699; MPR vs CPR p=0.914). An OS advantage was reported with Rd: median OS was not reached in Rd patients, and was 37 and 43 months in the MPR and CPR groups, respectively (Rd vs MPR p=0.04; Rd vs CPR p=0.430; MPR vs CPR p=0.323). The rate of at least one hematologic grade 3-4 adverse event was 29% in Rd, 66% in MPR, 33% in CPR patients \u2264 75 years and 29% in Rd, 70% in MPR, 33% in CPR patients > 75 years (MPR vs Rd/CPR p< 0.0001). No difference was observed in extra-hematologic adverse events: 25% in Rd, 24% in MPR and 25% in CPR patients \u226475 years; 29% in Rd, 35% in MPR, 34% in CPR patients >75 years. Conclusion : this trial compared for the first time Rd, MPR and CPR in elderly NDMM. In all patients, the addition of alkylating agent to Lenalidomide-steroid combination did not show any advantage on PFS and OS. In a subgroup analysis, safety and efficacy data suggest that triplet regimens may be indicated in patients \u226475 years, while a doublet regimens for those >75 years. The MPR combination showed a PFS advantage in patients \u226475 years, with a higher incidence of hematologic toxicity and SPM. In patients >75 years an OS advantage was reported with Rd, mainly due to a higher efficacy of salvage treatments. Updated results will be presented at the meeting.
