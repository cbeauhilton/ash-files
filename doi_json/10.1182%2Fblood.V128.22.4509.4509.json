    "abstract_text": "Introduction - Inhibition of Exportin 1 (XPO1) is a novel treatment approach for multiple myeloma (MM). XPO1 mediates the nuclear export of cell-cycle regulators and tumor suppressor proteins leading to their functional inactivation. In addition, XPO1 promotes the export and translation of the mRNA of key oncoproteins (e.g. c-MYC, BCL-2, Cyclin D). XPO1 overexpression occurs in solid and hematological malignancies, including MM and is essential for MM cell survival. Selinexor, the first oral SINE compound, has shown promising anti-MM activity in phase 1 studies but has been associated with gastrointestinal and constitutional toxicities including nausea, anorexia and fatigue. KPT-8602 is a second generation oral SINE compound with similar in vitro potency to selinexor, however, has substantially reduced brain penetration compared with selinexor, and demonstrated markedly improved tolerability with minimal anorexia and weight loss in preclinical toxicology studies. In murine models of MM, KPT-8602 can be dosed daily (QDx5) with minimal anorexia and weight loss. We have therefore initiated a phase 1/2 first-in-human clinical trial. Methods - This phase 1/2 clinical trial was designed to evaluate KPT-8602 as a single agent and in combination with low dose dexamethasone (dex) in patients (pts) with relapsed / refractory MM (RRMM). KPT-8602 is dosed orally (QDx5) for a 28-day cycle with a starting dose of 5 mg. Low dose dex (20 mg, twice weekly) is allowed after cycle 1 if at least a minimal response (MR) is not observed. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability including dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and evidence for anti-MM activity for KPT-8602 single agent and in combination with dex. The pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PDn; XPO1 mRNA) profile of KPT-8602 will also be determined. PDn predictive biomarker analysis and ex vivo drug response assays are underway using tumor cells from bone marrow aspirates before treatment, during and at relapse. These analyses include cell death pathway assays by flow and nuclear/cytoplasmic localization of XPO1, NF-\u0199B, I\u0199B\u03b1, IKK\u03b1, NRIF and p53 by imaging flow and IHC. Results - As of 01-Aug-2016, 6 pts 2 M/4 F, (median of 6 prior treatment regimens, median age of 71) with RRMM have been enrolled. Common related grade 1/2 adverse events (AEs) include thrombocytopenia (3 pts), nausea (2 pts) and diarrhea (2 pts). Grade 3 AEs include neutropenia (1 pt) and dehydration (1 pt). No grade 4 or 5 AEs have been reported. No DLTs have been observed and the MTD has not been reached. 5 pts were evaluable for responses (1 pt pending evaluation): 1 partial response, 1 minimal response, and 3 stable disease; no pts have progressed on therapy with the longest on for >5 months. The PK properties following oral administration showed that 5 mg of KPT-8602 was rapidly absorbed (mean t max = 1 hr, mean C max = 30.6 ng/mL). The mean AUC inf was calculated to be 141 ng\u2022hr/mL. After t max , KPT-8602 declined at an estimated mean t \u00bd of 4 hr. At the same dose level, XPO1 mRNA expression was the highest (~2.5 fold) at 8 hr post dose. Conclusions - Oral KPT-8602 is well tolerated in heavily pretreated pts with RRMM. Gastrointestinal and constitutional toxicities observed with twice weekly selinexor have not been observed with 5x/week KPT-8602, including in pts on study for >4 months. PK was predictable and in line with selinexor. These early results show encouraging disease control with pts remaining on therapy. Enrollment is on-going.
