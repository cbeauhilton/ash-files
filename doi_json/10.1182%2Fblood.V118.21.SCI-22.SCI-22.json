    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-22 Imbalances of iron homeostasis account for some of the most common human diseases. Pathologies can result from both iron deficiency or overload. The hepcidin/ferroportin and the IRE/IRP regulatory systems balance systemic and cellular iron metabolism, respectively, and understanding their points of intersection and crosstalk represents a major challenge in iron biology. I will discuss an emerging picture from studies with different mutant mouse lines according to which the \u201ccellular\u201d IRE/IRP system determines \u201cset points\u201d via its targets (including ferroportin and HIF2\u03b1). These are then subject to modulation via hepcidin in response to systemic cues. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
