    "abstract_text": "Due to the lack of large population-based studies, the incidence of polycythemia vera (PV) has not been well documented in the United States. In 2001, PV became reportable to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, which consists of high-quality population-based cancer registries supported and sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. In the present analysis, we accessed the SEER data to estimate the incidence of PV in the United States during 2001 \u2013 2003. Since the addition of PV to SEER reporting is fairly recent, and the diagnosis of PV is different from that of many other types of cancer, especially solid tumors, under-reporting is possible. Therefore, we also used health claims data from Medicare services to estimate the incidence of PV among individuals 65 years and older. SEER data suggest that the age-adjusted incidence rate of PV was 0.87 per 100,000 per year (95% confidence interval 0.83 \u2013 0.91) during 2001 \u2013 2003, which is lower than the estimates from other studies (Ania BJ et al. Trends in the incidence of polycythemia vera among Olmsted County, Minnesota residents, 1935\u20131989. Am J Hematol  1994 ; 47 (2): 89 \u201393 . Johansson P. Epidemiology of the myeloproliferative disorders polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. Semin Thromb Hemost  2006 ; 32 (3): 171 \u20133 ). The incidence of PV increased with age and was higher in men and white individuals than in women and other racial groups. The SEER-derived age-adjusted incidence rate of PV was 4.1 per 100,000 per year among individuals 65 years and older during 2003, which is considerably lower than the estimates made from nationwide Medicare claims data in the same age group during the same year, suggesting possible under-reporting to SEER. The addition of PV to SEER reporting represents a major step in generating population-based epidemiologic data for this understudied malignancy. However, it is critical to ensure the completeness in the ascertainment and reporting of PV so high-quality SEER data can be utilized to facilitate much needed research on the etiology and outcomes of PV, as well as other myeloproliferative disorders."
