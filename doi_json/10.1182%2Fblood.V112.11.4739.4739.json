    "abstract_text": "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) expanded ex vivo from aspirated marrow, have been used clinically with variable success to facilitate repair of infarcted hearts, treat graft versus host disease, and facilitate marrow reconstitution after radiation damage. While it is now generally acknowledged that these benefits are not the result of engraftment and differentiation of MSC into the target tissues, the mechanism by which these beneficial effects are achieved is not clear. We hypothesize that MSCs mediate their effect by activating an endogenous cell population which in turn modulates the immune response and/or homes to damaged tissue and participates in repair. To begin to test this hypothesis immortalized and cloned populations of canine MSC were generated to provide a consistent product for in vivo testing. One line, designated DS-1, has been evaluated in vivo by infusion into two normal dogs. Blood samples were taken pre infusion, immediately following infusion and at 1, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96 hours, and 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post infusion. Following infusion there was no consistent change in the number of WBC, however by day 3 there was a marked decrease in the % of CD3+ cells expressing FOXP3 and TGF\u03b2 in the blood, which did not recover to pre-infusion levels during the period of observation. At autopsy there was an increased number of these cells in the lymph nodes and spleen, whereas there was an overall decrease in the number of TH1 cells in these tissues. Quantitative RT- PCR analysis of cDNA prepared from blood mononuclear cells indicated an upregulation in the expression of CD133, Tie-2, and MARCO between 1\u201324 hours post infusion, and an increase in LOX1/OLR1 between 2\u20134 days. However the % of monocytes and the expression levels of CD14, CD68, CD45, and CD105/Endoglin were constant at all time points. Samples taken at 6 hours, 4 and 7 days post infusion were also analyzed for the presence of DS-1 cells by PCR and in vitro out growth assays. Results indicated that the DS-1cells were detectable up to 6 hours post infusion, but not thereafter. Adherent cells grown from blood mononuclear cells at days 4 and 7, displayed macrophage and endothelial cell morphologies. RT-PCR analysis of these cultures detected expression of macrophage associated markers CD14+/CD68+/MARCO+/LOX1+, as well as endothelial cell associated markers CD34+/CD144/VECAD+. These data indicate that a single infusion of DS-1 cells results in activation of circulating monocytes and a shift of regulatory T cells from the periphery to lymph nodes and spleen which persists for at least 28 days. We speculate that these changes may contribute to the immunomodulatory effects reported for some preparations of MSC.",
