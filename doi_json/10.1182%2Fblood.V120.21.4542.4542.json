    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4542 Introduction: Consolidation with autologous transplantation (AutoSCT) may extend progression free survival when administered following initial induction. There are limited data to support the role of AutoSCT in the relapsed or refractory setting. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated all patients with MCL transplanted at our institution before 2010. We identified 57 patients, among whom 42 were transplanted in first remission (CR1, n=32; PR1 n=10), 11 in second remission (CR2, n=4, PR2, n=7), and 4 with relapsed/refractory disease beyond first remission. Results: The median PFS are: CR1 37mo, PR1 24mo, CR2 not reached, and PR2 23mo. No statistically significant difference was observed between patients transplanted CR1 vs PR1 (p one-sided =0.08), CR2 vs PR2 (p one-sided =0.10), or in CR/PR1 vs CR/PR2 (p one-sided =0.39). The median PFS for those with refractory disease, and/or those transplanted beyond second remission was 6mo which is significantly inferior to the cohort of those transplanted in first or second remission (p one-sided =.01). The median OS calculated from transplant are: CR1 63mo, PR1 50mo, CR2 not reached, PR2 45mo. No statistically significant difference was observed between patients transplanted CR1 vs PR1 (p one-sided =0.47), CR2 vs PR2 (p one-sided =0.46), or in CR/PR1 vs CR/PR2 (p one-sided =0.29). The median OS for those with refractory disease, and/or those transplanted beyond second remission was 16mo which is not statistically significantly inferior to the cohort of those transplanted in first or second remission (p one-sided =.067). MIPI data collected at diagnosis were available for 30 patients, all transplanted in first or second remission with chemosensitive disease. These data were not predictive of survival or progression from transplantation. Simplified MIPI obtained at the time of transplant were available for 44 patients, all transplanted in first or second remission with chemosensitive disease. These data were similarly uninformative for prediction of progression or survival from transplantation. Conclusions: Consolidation with AutoSCT may be similarly effective for patients in first relapse with chemosensitive disease. MIPI at diagnosis and the simplified MIPI at transplant may failed to account for survival among highly selected patients considered eligible for transplantation.
