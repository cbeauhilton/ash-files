    "abstract_text": "Anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens are considered the gold standard for treating patients with DLBCL. Prior to administration of chemotherapy, LVEF is routinely measured, usually by multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scans or echocardiography, as a screening tool for detecting asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. LVEF screening is recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical practice guidelines, is endorsed by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, appears on Federal Drug Administration-approved labeling guidelines, and is often required for patients to participate in US cancer cooperative group clinical trails. However, despite these recommendations, evidence supporting the utility of LVEF measurement prior to administration of anthracycline-based chemotherapy in patients with DLBCL is lacking (Conrad, J Oncol Pract 2012). The most common chemotherapy regimen currently administered to DLBCL patients is rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). Patients with stage III or IV DLBCL typically receive 6 to 8 cycles of R-CHOP, with cumulative doses of doxorubicin ranging from 300 - 400 mg/m 2 . Cumulative doses of doxorubicin greater than 400 mg/m 2 have been associated with an increased risk of congestive heart failure (CHF) (Von Hoff, Ann Intern Med 1979). We are performing a retrospective analysis of approximately 325 patients with DLBCL who received treatment at Virginia Mason Medical Center from 2001-2011. Our objectives include the following: (1) to determine whether LVEF was measured by echocardiogram or MUGA scan prior to administration of anthracycline-based chemotherapy, (2) to establish whether the chemotherapy treatment regimen was modified based on LVEF values, and (3) to document the incidence of CHF in patients with DLBCL who did receive anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Patients were identified through a search of the Virginia Mason Cancer Registry. Specific data currently being collected through chart review include the following: age at diagnosis; Ann Arbor lymphoma stage; type of chemotherapy given; cumulative doxorubicin dose administered (mg/m 2 ); LVEF measurement and modality used to assess LVEF; and incidence of CHF. We are also recording the number of CHF risk factors that patients possess, including male sex, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, prior cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, smoking history, prior chemotherapy, radiation to the chest area, and other cardio-toxic exposures. Statistical analyses will include a Fischer\u2019s exact or Chi-squared test to compare study groups and a Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare the number of CHF risk factors. A P value of less than 0.05 will be used to determine if an association is significant. In a preliminary sample of DLBCL patients (n = 50), 28 are men (56%). LVEF was measured in 40 patients (80%) prior to initiation of chemotherapy using echocardiogram (95%) and MUGA scan (5%). LVEF values were normal (55 \u2013 75%) in 36 patients (90%), low (< 55%) in 3 patients (8%), and unknown in 1 patient (2%). Of the 36 patients with normal LVEF values, 30 received CHOP or R-CHOP regimens (83%), 2 received non-anthracycline chemotherapy (5%), 1 was treated by surgical excision alone (3%), 2 received no treatment (6%), and 1 patient\u2019s treatment was unknown (3%). Of the 3 patients with initial low screening LVEF values, none had a prior history of CHF and all received R-CHOP (100%). Three patients did have CHF prior to treatment; however, only one received CHOP therapy. Of our initial 50 patients, 31 (62%) are alive and 2 (4%) were lost to follow-up. CHF was listed as a major contributor of death in 3 patients (6%). The median number of CHF risk factors did not differ significantly between patients who did develop CHF post-treatment and those who did not (4 vs. 2, P = 0.133). Our preliminary results suggest that the decision to administer an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen was not directly affected by echocardiogram or MUGA scan results. If these findings are reinforced at completion of our chart review, it may challenge the existing policy of routinely screening patients with DLBCL with echocardiograms or MUGA scans prior to initiation of treatment.
