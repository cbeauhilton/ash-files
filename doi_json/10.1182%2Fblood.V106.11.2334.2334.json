    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Frequently transfused patients with SCD develop hemosiderosis, which, if untreated, results in multi-organ damage and early death. DFO is the only iron chelator (IC) approved by the FDA and is injected subcutaneously over 8\u201312 hours/day, 5\u20137 days/week. However, adherence to this therapy is difficult for patients. This report summarises patient satisfaction with deferasirox (DSX), an oral IC in development, compared to DFO in an open-label Phase II trial. Methods: A total of 195 patients with SCD were randomized and treated with DSX (n=132) or DFO (n=63). Seventy-four patients had not received IC at baseline, of whom 25 were randomized to DFO and 49 to DSX. DSX was taken orally once/day while DFO was infused via a portable pump over 8\u201312 hours/day, 5\u20137 days/week. Patient reported outcome data were documented, including satisfaction and convenience with treatment, and number of hours lost/month for taking IC. Patients with previous experiences of DFO reported preferences for DSX, DFO, or neither. At end-of-study (EOS), patients reported their willingness to continue taking the drug they were on. Results: At baseline, only 21% of patients previously treated with DFO reported that they were \u2018very satisfied\u2019 or \u2018satisfied\u2019 with DFO taken prior to the study, and only 16.5% reported that DFO was \u2018very convenient\u2019 or \u2018convenient\u2019. Further, 77.1% of them preferred DSX. Reasons included: more convenient to take (38.6%), less disruptive to their day (18.1%), less sore (15.7%) and less disruptive to sleep (6.0%). Table 1 indicates the greater satisfaction and convenience experienced by those on DSX versus DFO regardless of chelation status at baseline. At EOS, significantly more patients on DSX (84.3%) indicated they would be willing to continue DSX, compared to 10.5% of patients on DFO. Similarly, patients reported that time lost due to taking DSX ranged from 0.2\u20132.9 hours/month, while time lost due to taking DFO ranged from 3.2\u201337.4 hours/month. Table 1.

Further studies are needed to explore whether higher satisfaction and convenience will lead to better adherence to DSX. As adherence to chelation therapy impacts on survival in transfusion-dependent patients with SCD, these data indicate that DSX may significantly improve the care of transfusion-dependent patients.",
