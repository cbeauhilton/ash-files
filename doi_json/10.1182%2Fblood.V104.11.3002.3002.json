    "abstract_text": "The nucleoporin gene NUP98 is known to be rearranged in several recurrent translocations occurring in de novo and therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukemia, in children or adults. All these abnormalities seem to have bad prognosis, thus, it is important to identify NUP98 rearrangements. As other genes ( MLL , ETV6, RUNX1, ...), NUP98 may fuse to different partners, often homeobox genes such as HOXA , HOXC , HOXD , PMX1 , but also non homeobox genes such as RAP1GSD1 , NSD1 , NSD3 , LEDGF , ADD3 , DDX10 , and TOP1 . The fusion transcript always juxtapose the N-terminal FG repeats of NUP98, required for its docking function, to the C-terminus of the partner gene, which contains the homeodomain in the case of a homeobox partner gene. We identified a t(9;11)(q34.1;p15.5) by conventional cytogenetic analysis, in a 65 years old Caucasian female who developed a t-AML four years after lymphoma treatment. The involvement of NUP98 gene was confirmed by FISH analysis using BAC RP11-120E20 and PAC RP11-1173K1. 3\u2032RACE analysis allowed to identified a novel partner gene, the class II homeobox gene PRRX2 ( Paired Related homeobox 2 ), located on 9q34. The breakpoint occurred in an infrequent breaking region in exon 11 of NUP98 , and in exon 2 of PRRX2 . The NUP98-PRRX2 fusion transcript was cloned and sequenced, and confirmed by RT-PCR. As its homologue PRRX1 ( PMX1 ), PRRX2 is a DNA-binding transcription factor that is essential for fetal development. PRRX1 has been described to be fused with NUP98 in t(1;11)(q23;p15), but it is the first time PRRX2 is implicated in leukemia, and even in malignancy. Further studies are necessary to confirm the recurrence of this translocation and its prognosis. Furthermore, transformation assays in cells lines and transgenic mice studies would be interesting to understand the leukemogenicity induced by the NUP98-PRRX2 fusion transcript.",
