    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4687 A 70 year old female with diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis with worsening fatigue, intermittent shaking chills and fever for 2 weeks. She had been on oral prednisone 5 mg daily and methotrexate 15 mg every week for her rheumatoid arthritis. Vital signs were stable and physical examination was significant for 3+ lower extremity edema and pallor. The CBC showed pancytopenia, white cell count of 2.5\u00d710 9 /L (4.3\u201310.8\u00d710 9 /L), hemoglobin was 9.2g/dl (11.0\u201315.0g/dl), and platelet counts were 93 \u00d7 10 9 /L (130\u2013400 \u00d7 10 9 /L). SHe had mildly elevated total bilirubin 1.7mg/dl (0.0\u20131.2mg/dl), elevated alkaline phosphate 1212U/L (38\u2013126 U/L) liver enzymes, SGPT 83U/L (0\u201340U/L), SGOT 126U/L (0\u201335U/L), and elevated blood sugar of 260mg/dl. Blood cultures remain negative for bacterial growth for multiple days. Her SPEP, ANA, HIV, CMV, and EBV serology were negative. CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were consistent with hilar, mediastinal lymphadenopathy and upper abdominal lymphadenopathy with splenomegaly. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy was consistant with histoplasma capsulatum infection. Patient was treated with IV amphotericin B for 4 weeks. Histoplasma capsulatum was identified from fungal culture from the bone marrow aspirate. Retrospectively urine analysis for histoplasma antigen was positive by ELISA. Subsequently patient recieved itraconazole for 6 months. Cytopenia and symptoms improved and lymphadenopathy regressed. Most patoents who develop disseminated histoplasmosis are immunosuppressed It often mimic the presentation of malignancy like lymphoma or infection like tuberculosis and inflammatory process like sarcoidosis. Misdiagnosis can lead to inappropriate and harmful therapy with glucocorticoides and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Diagnosis requires high index of suspicion and familiarity with clinical presentation and appropriate diagnostic test. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
