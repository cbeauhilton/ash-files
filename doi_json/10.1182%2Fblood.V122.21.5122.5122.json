    "abstract_text": "Background MCL is incurable. Bortezomib has shown single agent activity of 33% in relapsed MCL. Pre-clinical published data shows additive/synergistic activity of BCR. Materials and methods MCL pts \u00a0ages 18 through 85, with adequate organ function unless due to lymphoma, and without HIV-1 infection or any significant medical/mental condition, were treated under an IRB-approved study, consisting of Bortezomib \u00a01.3 mg/m2 IV given on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 (dose on day 11 omitted early on study); fractionated cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 q 12 hrs days 1, 2, and 3, and rituximab 375 mg/m2 day 1. Cycles were repeated every 21 days for a total of 6 or less if a response was achieved and patient qualified for SCT. Results From\u00a0 9/2009 to 8/2012, twenty-one patients were entered in the study. Their clinical characteristics are as follows:  VARIABLE . RESULT . Age range (median) n = 21 55-73 (66) Male n = 21 14 (67%) MIPI :  Low 12 (57%) Intermediate 6 (29%) High 3 (14%) Ki-67 range (median) 10-70 (45) Blastoid 7 (33%) AA stage IV 100% Nodal disease 100% VARIABLE . RESULT . Age range (median) n = 21 55-73 (66) Male n = 21 14 (67%) MIPI :  Low 12 (57%) Intermediate 6 (29%) High 3 (14%) Ki-67 range (median) 10-70 (45) Blastoid 7 (33%) AA stage IV 100% Nodal disease 100% View Large Overall response (OR)/CR rates: 71%/53%. One patient had stable disease and 4 patients progressed. With a Median follow-up of 31 months, the median TTP was 15.8 months and the median OS was 36.4 months. Toxicity was mainly hematologic. With 77 cycles given, grade 3 anemia was 5%, grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was 16%/9%, and grade 3 / 4 thrombocytopenia was 19%/8%. Early in the study, day 11 dose of bortezomib was omitted because of low counts by day 11 of cycle. Non-hematologic toxicity included grade 3 neutropenic fever (1%), and grade 3 fatigue (3%). No patient developed sensory neuropathy grade \u00be. Conclusion Bortezomib can be safely combined with cyclophosphamide and rituximab and results in high rates of overall/complete responses in patients with relapsed/refractory MCL.
