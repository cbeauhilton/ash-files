    "abstract_text": "Introduction: We previously reported that treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell lymphoma with the pan-class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor copanlisib resulted in durable responses with a manageable safety profile (Dreyling et al., J Clin Oncol 35:3898-3905, 2017). Copanlisib is administered intravenously on an intermittent schedule and two of the most commonly reported adverse events are infusion-related transient elevations in blood glucose and blood pressure. Patients with a medical history of diabetes mellitus or hypertension were allowed to enroll in the CHRONOS-1 study if these conditions were well controlled. We report here on the outcomes for these subsets of patients. Methods: Patients with histologically confirmed indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed after, or refractory to, \u22652 prior lines of treatment were eligible. Previous treatment had to include rituximab and an alkylating agent or regimen. Copanlisib (60 mg) was administered I.V. on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Treatment continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per independent radiologic review (Cheson et al., JCO 20:579, 2007). Secondary efficacy endpoints included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Adverse events (AEs) were reported using MedDRA (version 19.1). The cut-off for this analysis was February 2018. Results: A total of 142 patients were treated, with follicular lymphoma (FL) being the principal histology (n=104). The median age was 63 years (range 25-82). Median number of prior lines of treatment was 3 (range 2-9), with 61% being refractory to the last regimen. Twenty patients with diabetes were enrolled; 17 patients with a history of diabetes mellitus, 1 with history of impaired glucose tolerance, and 2 diagnosed at screening. Forty one patients with a medical history of hypertension were enrolled; baseline median systolic blood pressure was 126 mmHg in hypertensive subgroup vs 118 mmHg in non-hypertensives. At the time of analysis, the median duration of treatment was 5.0 months in the diabetic pts, 6.0 months in non-diabetics, 6.0 months in hypertensive pts, and 5.9 months in non-hypertensives. The ORR was >60% in all subsets with the exception of the diabetic subset, where the ORR was 40% (Table). The median DOR was also the shortest for the diabetic subset (7.1 mo); 3 patients were in response for more than 2 yrs. The mDOR for non-diabetics was 14.9 mo. Interestingly, the hypertensive patient subset had the highest rate of CR (26.8%). Of the 41 pts in this subset, 31 were FL patients, and among these patients 10 (32.3%) had a CR. Likewise, the mDOR for the hypertensive subset was 22.6 mo; the non-hypertensive subset had a mDOR of 10.9 mo. Median PFS for the four subsets were: 7.2 mo for diabetics, 13.8 mo for non-diabetics, 19.0 mo for hypertensives, and 11.3 mo for non-hypertensives. Median OS had not yet been reached in the non-diabetic and non-hypertensive subsets. Regarding AEs of interest possibly impacted by pre-existing conditions, all-grade (G) treatment-emergent hyperglycemia was reported in 85% and 44.3% of diabetic and non-diabetic groups, respectively. G4 hyperglycemia was reported in 7/20 (35%) of diabetic patients but in in only 3 (2.5% of non-diabetics). Two diabetic patients and one non-diabetic patient discontinued treatment due to hyperglycemia. Mean \u00b1 SD hemoglobin A1c values increased 0.64\u00b10.9% from baseline to last value on treatment in diabetics and 0.50\u00b10.8% in non-diabetics. All-grade hypertension was reported for 43.9% of hypertensive patients and was principally G3 (39.0%). In non-hypertensives the all-grade and G3 values were 23.8% and 17.8%, respectively. There were no G4 events. One patient discontinued due to hypertension (G2). There were two G3 cardiac-related events (atrial fibrillation and left ventricular dysfunction) and one G4 event (arrhythmia) in the hypertensive group. Conclusions: These results support use of copanlisib in indolent lymphoma patients with well-controlled diabetes or hypertension. In particular, the transient hyperglycemia in diabetic patients did not exacerbate metabolic status as reflected in HbA1c values. Thus, patients with these pre-existing conditions should not be precluded treatment a priori .
