    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2179 Poster Board II-156 Point mutations in the BCR-ABL1 protein are the most commonly reported mechanism of resistance to imatinib mesylate (Gleevec or STI -571) treatment in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We have reported that some patients with imatinib-resistant CML express an alternatively spliced BCR-ABL1 mRNA with a 35-bp insertion (BCR-ABL135INS), but the prevalence and effect of this mutation have not been well delineated. We sought to improve understanding of this mutation in order to provide insight into mechanisms of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Using a sensitive PCR method, we determined the prevalence of the alternatively spliced BCR-ABL135INS mRNA in a group of 168 patients with chronic-phase CML resistant to imatinib. Expression of truncated protein was confirmed by Western blot in patient samples. The effects of various kinase inhibitors on human K562 CML cells transfected with BCR-ABL135INS cDNA were tested by measuring cell survival, caspase-3 activation, and the BIM activation pathway. In our analysis of BCR-ABL1 genotypes in 168 imatinib-resistant chronic-phase CML patients, (56%) of patients expressed various levels of BCR-ABL135INS whereas only (25%) had detectable point mutations in BCR-ABL1. Expression of this truncated BCR-ABL1 fusion protein was also confirmed by immunoprecipitation at levels proportional to those predicted by mRNA quantification. In vitro, BCR-ABL135INS expression conferred resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib in a concentration-dependent fashion, but had no effect on the protein-synthesis inhibitor homoharringtonine (HHT or omacetaxine) or the aurora kinase inhibitor MK-0457 (VX-680). The combination of imatinib with nilotinib or HHT was synergistic in overcoming BCR-ABL135INS-induced resistance. Moreover, the resistance to imatinib induced by BCR-ABL135INS was associated with loss of BIM expression. This loss of BIM was overcome by pretreatment with HHT. In conclusion, these findings emphasize the importance of the overlooked alternatively spliced BCR-ABL135INS found in imatinib-resistant CML patients. Optimal patient management in the future will likely require periodic testing for the expression of BCR-ABL-135INS mRNA during therapy. This may help in predicting various levels of resistance or the potential for eliminating the disease by adjusting the treatment strategy. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
