    "abstract_text": "The transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) may induce tumorigenesis or suppress tumor growth in a tissue-dependent manner. We found that overexpression of KLF4 induced not only human acute T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines but also primary samples from T-ALL patients to undergo apoptosis through the BCL2/BCLXL pathway in vitro. T cell-associated genes including BCL11B, GATA3, and TCF7 were negatively regulated by KLF4 overexpression. Especially, KLF4 induced SUMOylation and degradation of BCL11B. However, the KLF4-induced apoptosis in T-ALL was rescued by the in vivo microenvironment. Furthermore, the invasion capacity of T-ALL to hosts was compromised when KLF4 was overexpressed. In normal human T cells, the overexpression of KLF4 severely impaired T cell development at early stages, but the blockage of T cell development was resumed by restoration of GATA3 or ICN1. In summary, our data demonstrate that KLF4 acts as a tumor suppressor in malignant T cells and that downregulation of KLF4 may be a prerequisite for early human T cell development and homeostasis.
