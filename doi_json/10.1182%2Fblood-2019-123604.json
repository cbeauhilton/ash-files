    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells exhibit metabolic alterations that may provide therapeutic targets not necessarily evident in the cancer cell genome. Among the metabolic features we noted in AML compared with normal hematopoietic stem and progenitors (HSPC) was a strikingly consistent alkaline intracellular pH (pHi). Among candidate proton regulators, monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) mRNA and protein were differentially increased in multiple human and mouse AML cell lines and primary AML cells. MCT4 is a plasma membrane H + and lactate co-transporter whose activity necessarily shifts protons extracellularly as intracellular lactate is extruded. MCT4 activity is increased when overexpressed or with increased intracellular lactate generated by glycolysis in the setting of nutrient abundance. With increased MCT4 activity, extracellular lactate and protons will increase causing extracellular acidification while alkalinizing the intracellular compartment. MCT4-knockout (MCT4-KO) of mouse and human AMLdid not induce compensatory MCT1 expression, reduced pHi, suppressed proliferation and improved animal survival. Growth reduction was experimentally defined to be due to intracellular acidification rather than lactate accumulation by independent modulation of those parameters. MCT4-KOmetabolic profiling demonstrated decreased ATP/ADP and increased NADP + /NADPH suggesting suppression of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) that was confirmed by stable isotopic carbon flux analyses. Notably,the enzymatic activity of purified gatekeeper enzymes, hexokinase 1 (HK1), pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) was sensitive to pH with increased activity at the leukemic pHi (pH 7.6) compared to normal pHi (pH 7.3). Evaluating MCT4 transcriptional regulation, we defined that activating histonemarks, H3K27ac and H3K4me3, were enriched at the MCT4 promoter region as were transcriptional regulators MLL1 and Brd4 by ChIP in AML compared with normal cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of Brd4 suppressed Brd4 and H3K27ac enrichment and MCT4 expression in AML and reduced leukemic cell growth. To determine whether MCT4 based pHi changes were sufficient to increase cell proliferation, we overexpressed MCT4 in normal HSPC and demonstrated in vivo increases in growth in conjunction with pHi alkalization. Some other cell types also were increased in their growth kinetics by MCT4 overexpression and pHi increase. Therefore, proton shifting may be a means by which cells respond to nutrient abundance, co-transporting lactate and protons out of the cell, increasing the activity of enzymes that enhance PPP and glycolysis for biomass generation. Epigenetic changes in AML appear to exploit that process by increasing MCT4 expression to enforce proton exclusion thereby gaining a growth advantage without dependence on signaling pathways. Inhibiting MCT4 and intracellular alkalization may diminish the ability of AML to outcompete normal hematopoiesis.
