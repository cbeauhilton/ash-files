    "abstract_text": "Introduction Over the past decade, treatments for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have produced complete remissions (CR) without evidence for minimal residual disease (MRD), particularly for younger and/or fitter patients. In this setting, achieving an MRD-negative CR has prognostic implications, yielding longer progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than for patients who achieve a CR with persistent MRD. Complicating efforts to incorporate testing for MRD in clinical practice has been the lack of a defined consensus on the methods of MRD detection. In this study, we report on a novel combination of mAbs for MRD detection by flow cytometry based on two antigens: the NK-cell receptor and tumor specific antigen, CD160; and the tumor associated antigen, receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR-1). Objective To compare a novel single-tube, tumor-specific (CD160+ROR1) targeted approach to MRD detection against the previously published CD160 flow cytometric assay (CD160FCA) (Farren et al, 2011) and the new, single-tube 8-color ERIC assay. Methods Between October 2012 and July 2013, prospective assessment of MRD was performed on peripheral blood in 56 patients (86 samples). We developed a flow cytometric assay using mAbs specific for CD160 or ROR1 (Fukuda et al, 2008). For this we used the following mAb from BD Biosciences: CD2 FITC, CD5 Pe-Cy7, CD19 PerCP5.5, CD45V500, CD160PE, ROR-1 AF647 (\u201cROR-160FCA\u201d) and a sequential gating strategy. This was compared with CD160FCA and the 8-color ERIC consortium protocol (unpublished). Light chain analysis (LCR) was performed in all cases and reported where detectable. A proof of concept spiking experiment simulating MRD was prepared by mixing CLL and normal peripheral blood leukocytes in a serial dilution to a level of 10 -5 (n=3). Statistical analysis was performed using Spearman Rank correlation coefficients, Mann-Whitney t-test, and Bland-Altman method comparison. Significance was set at <0.05%. Results To establish the proof of principle, MRD levels ranging from 0.001% to 100% (Neat CLL) were prepared by serial dilutions, in which MRD levels could be established by the ROR-160FCA to 10 -5 (n=3). Assessment of the observed incidence against expected incidence of CLL MRD demonstrated a highly significant correlation (R 2 =0.96, p=0.01). In the study, the range of detectable disease went from <0.01% to 38.59%, of which 37% of samples had levels below <0.01%. Analyzing all flow cytometric methods, a highly significant correlation was observed between all three: CD160FCA vs ERIC: Spearman R=0.96 (95%CI: 0.93 - 0.97, p<0.001); CD160FCA vs ROR-160FCA: Spearman R=0.97 (95%CI: 0.96 \u2013 0.99, p<0.001); ROR-160FCA vs ERIC: Spearman R=0.97 (95%CI: 0.94 \u2013 0.98, p<0.001). 54 samples had levels of disease <1%. Bland-Altman assay comparison in these patients again demonstrated significant associations between the assays (CD160FCA vs ERIC: mean 0.08 \u00b10.15; CD160FCA vs ROR-160FCA: mean 0.04 \u00b10.19; ROR-160FCA vs ERIC: mean 0.03 \u00b10.25). Light chain restriction was detectable in 24 patients (size of the restricted population ranged from 0.2% to 47% of all cellular events). This sub-group of patients also demonstrated excellent correlation between level of LCR and detectable disease by CD160FCA (Spearman R=0.96, 95%CI: 0.92-0.98, p<0.001), ERIC (R=0.95, 95%CI: 0.92-0.98, p<0.01) and ROR-160FCA (R=0.97, 95%CI 0.93-0.98, p<0.001). Conclusion Monitoring minimal residual disease in CLL is a key focus for clinical trials, as MRD is an important prognostic marker in CLL in terms of PFS and OS. Here we provide a single tube assay, ROR-160FCA, which is unique by targeting two antigens restricted to malignant B-cells, CD160 and ROR1. ROR-160FCA is equivalent in MRD detection compared to both CD160FCA and the current ERIC assay under development. The two tumor-specific antigens give ROR-160FCA the potential for improved sensitivity, particularly where limited sample is available. Furthermore, it only requires a simple sequential gating strategy, is rapid, and appears more cost effective than other Methods. References Farren TW, Giustiniani J, Liu FT et al.
