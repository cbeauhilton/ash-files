    "abstract_text": "Background: In multiple myeloma (MM), impact of specific chromosomal translocations involving IgH (14q21 locus, including t(4;14), t(11;14), and t(14;16) etc.) has been explored extensively. However, over 15% MM patients harboring IgH translocation with undefined partners have long been ignored. Methods: A prospective non-randomized cohort study with a total of 715 newly-diagnosed MM cases was conducted, 13.6% of whom were t(14;undefined) positive. The whole cohort was divided into four groups: no IgH split (47.7%); t(14;undefined) (13.6%); t(11;14) (17.6%); and t(4;14) or t(14;16) group (21.1%). Results: Median OS for the four groups were 84.2, not reached (NR), 58.7, and 44.2 months respectively, with p values for t(14;undefined) vs. no IgH split, t(11;14), and t(4;14)/t(14;16) groups of 0.197, 0.022 and 0.001, respectively(Figure B).In bortezomib-based group, the survival advantage gained by t(14;undefined) group was much more significant compared to t(11;14) and t(4;14)/t(14;16) groups. Importantly, t(14;undefined) turned out to be an independent predictive factor for longer OS of MM patients in multivariate analysis, especially in the context of bortezomib-treatment. Similar results were also observed in the PUMCH external validation cohort (Figure C). Conclusion: Collectively, our data confirmed and externally validated the favorable prognosis of the t(14;undefined) groups, especially in the era of novel agents.
