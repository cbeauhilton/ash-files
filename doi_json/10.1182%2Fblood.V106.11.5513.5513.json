    "abstract_text": "RICE/ICE is an effective re-induction chemotherapy regime for patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive lymphoma prior to autologous stem cell transplantation. There is however a paucity of data on its effectiveness as a peripheral blood stem cell mobilising regime. We present data on its use in 23 patients, age 50 \u00b1 15 (mean \u00b1 SD), with relapsed (n=16) or primary refactory (n=7) lymphoma (DLBCL (n=15), mantle cell (n=1), high grade transformation of follicular lymphoma (n=5), Hodgkins lymphoma (n=1), Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (n=1)). RICE (Rituximab 375mg/m 2 (day 1), Etoposide 100mg/m 2 (days 1\u20133), Carboplatin 5x(CrCl+25)mg/m 2 (day 2) and Ifosphamide 5000mg/m 2 (day 2)) was administered as re-induction chemotherapy (4 patients did not receive Rituximab) along with Filgrastim 10mcg/kg/day from day 5 until collection. Apheresis was attempted on day 15 in those patients (n=18) achieving a peripheral blood CD34+ve cell count greater than 10x10 3 /ml. Peripheral blood stem cells were collected on a Gambro Cobe Spectra cell seperator processing a median of 2.5 blood volumes by standard protocols. Eight patients achieved a successful collection in the first apheresis session, six patients required a single further collection on day 16 and four patients required further collections on days 16 and 17. The median CD34+ve cell dose collected was 5.01x10 6 /kg (range 0.5x10 6 /kg \u2212 17.4x10 6 /kg) with only 2 patients achieving inadequate collections (0.5x10 6 /kg and 1.37x10 6 /kg). In total 70% (16 of 23) of patients successfully achieved PBSC collections of greater than 2.0x10 6 /kg. The group of patients that failed to mobilise was not predictable in terms of known adverse markers such as marrow involvement, underlying low grade lymphoma or previous chemo/radiotherapy. In conclusion successful PBSC collection was achieved in the majority of patients treated with RICE/ICE although the number of patients is small and larger numbers will be required to confirm these results.",
