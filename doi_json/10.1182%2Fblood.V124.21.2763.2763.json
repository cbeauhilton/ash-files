    "abstract_text": "Agonist induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including superoxide anion (O - 2 ) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) enhance platelet aggregation and hence the risk of thrombosis. Although diverse biochemical reactions contribute to ROS generation, NADPH oxidases (NOX) have emerged as critical sources of agonist induced ROS generation in platelets. Previous studies have shown that small GTPases Rac1 and RhoA are involved in NOX activation. Rac GTPase activates NOX by directly binding to NOX as well as by interacting with p67 phox to promote its binding to NOX (Physiol Rev 87: 245\u2013313, 2007), whereas RhoA triggers ROS generation via the ROCK/p38MAPK cascade mediated phosphorylation of p47 phox , a critical component of the NOX complex, (Exp Mol Med 37:575-87, 2005). To date, however, the roles of Rac1 and RhoA in platelet ROS production remain unclear. This study was conducted to define the contributions of Rac1- and RhoA- signaling to ROS generation and platelet function. ROS generation was quantified by flow cytometry in dcf-da (10 \u00b5M) loaded washed platelets. Thrombin has been shown to generate ROS in human platelets (Blood 106: 2757-2760, 2005). In this study we confirmed that platelets stimulated with thrombin generate ROS in a time- and a concentration- dependent manner. Addition of thrombin to human platelets pre-treated with NSC23766, a Rac-specific inhibitor, or murine platelets with Rac1 gene deletion, produced significantly less ROS than the matching control samples. Further, Phox-I, a pharmacologic inhibitor of Rac-p67phox interaction (Chem Biol 19: 228-24, 2012), potently suppressed thrombin induced ROS production, indicating that a Rac1-p67phox signaling axis is involved in thrombin mediated ROS production. Separately, treatment of washed human platelets with a RhoA specific inhibitor, Rhosin (Chem Biol 19:699-710, 2012) resulted in: (a) inhibition of the U46619, a stable analog of TXA 2 , induced activation of RhoA, but not that of Rac1or Cdc42; (b) U46619 induced phosphorylation p38MAPK and p47 phox ; and (c) U46619 or thrombin induced ROS generation. We further investigated the role of RhoA/ROCK/p38MAPK in ROS production by using platelets from RhoA -/- mice, Y27632 (a ROCK inhibitor) and SB203580 (a p38MAPK inhibitor). RhoA -/- platelets or human platelets treated with Y27632 or SB203580 exhibited significantly diminished ROS generation in response to thrombin. Next, we investigated the physiological effects of Rhosin on platelet activation. A pre-incubation of washed human platelets with Rhosin inhibited U46619 or thrombin induced platelet shape change, release of P-selectin, secretion of ATP and aggregation. The anti-platelet effects of Rhosin were reversible as washing of platelets after incubation with Rhosin abolished the inhibitory effect of Rhosin on platelet aggregation. These results suggest that (a) RhoA signaling, through ROCK/MAPK/p47 phox activation, leads to ROS generation and platelet activation in conjunction with or independent of the RhoA/ROCK mediated phosphorylation of MLC, and (b) Rac1 and RhoA differentially regulate platelet ROS generation by directly binding to NOX, promoting binding of p67phox to NOX and by phosphorylation of p47phox, respectively.
