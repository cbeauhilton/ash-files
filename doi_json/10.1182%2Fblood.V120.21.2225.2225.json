    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2225 Introduction IB1001 is a recombinant factor IX product being investigated for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in individuals with hemophilia B. Pharmacokinetics (PK) in adults (>12 years) demonstrated that IB1001 had results similar to the currently available recombinant FIX with respect to parameters such as terminal phase half-life and incremental recovery. We report the interim findings from a PK assessment in children 50 prior exposure days to FIX, and no history of or currently detectable inhibitor to FIX. Methods Non-randomized, open-label PK study with patients receiving 75\u00b15 IU/kg of IB1001 following a washout period of \u22654 days from a previous FIX infusion. Factor IX levels were determined pre-infusion and at 15\u201330 minutes, 4\u20136, 24\u201326, and 68\u201372 hours post-infusion. Additional samples could be drawn at 1\u20133 and 10\u201314 hours. Calculated PK parameters were: half-life (\u03b2-phase t 1/2 , determined using a robust regression approach [Lee ML et al. XVI th ISTH Congress, Florence, Italy, 1997]) but generally assuming a single compartmental model because of the small number of points, maximum plasma concentration (C max ), in vivo recovery (IVR) and AUC (0-\u221e) (determined by the trapezoidal rule). In addition, the AUC (0-t) and mean residence time (MRT) were calculated. Results  Subject . t 1/2 \u03b1 (hr) . t 1/2 \u03b2 (hr) . MRT (hr) . C max (IU/dl) . In vivo Recovery (IU/dl) .

Haemophilia, 18, 2012), the results in pediatric patients demonstrate a more rapid metabolism of factor IX as is indicated by the shorter terminal half-life (mean\u00b1SD of 19.3\u00b17.8 h versus 29.6\u00b118.2 h in adults) and the smaller AUC 0-\u221e (mean\u00b1SD of 1059\u00b1264 versus 1668\u00b1598 in adults). In addition, the in vivo recovery was lower (mean\u00b1SD of 0.69\u00b10.21) versus that seen in adults (mean\u00b1SD of 0.98\u00b10.22). These results are similar to those reported by Berntorp et al (Haemophilia, 7, 2001) with nonacog alfa. Conclusions The pharmacokinetics of IB1001 has previously been shown to be non-inferior to nonacog alfa, another recombinant factor IX, in hemophilia B individuals >12 years of age. The current study is intended to provide information on children 12 years of age. Although the study is ongoing, these may represent important implications for the potential use of IB1001 in pediatric patients.
