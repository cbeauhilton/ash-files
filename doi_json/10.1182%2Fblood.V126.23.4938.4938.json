    "abstract_text": "Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) can induce apoptosis in cancer cells but not in most normal cells, and is identified to be effective in various cancers, include myeloid leukemic cells [1] . Although some leukemia cell lines, K562 and KG-1, are sensitive to TRAIL, many showed certain degrees of resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis [2,3] , and the mechanism remains largely unknown, which forced us to find out ways to solve the problem. In this study, we investigated whether thioridazine, a phenothiazine derivative, could overcome the TRAIL resistance in K562 and KG-1 cells. Recently, we showed that Compared to treatment with thioridazine or TRAIL alone, co-treatment with thioridazine and TRAIL-induced apoptosis in K562 and KG-1 cells synergistically. This combination led to activation of caspase-8 and Bid, the cytosolic cumulation of cytochrome c from mitochondria as well as caspase-3 activated downstream. Treatment with thioridazine induced down-regulation of PI3K-AKT-NF-\u03baB pathway. meanwhile, thioridazine dropped the level of NF-\u03baB-dependent Bcl-xL, leading caspase activated and Bid cleaved. the expression of TRAIL-receptors in both K562 and KG-1 cells underwentthe treatment of thioridazine investigated that thioridazine significantly up-regulated DR5 by up to 51.22%, but not other TRAIL-receptors such as DR4, decoy receptor 1, and DcR2. Therefore, our results indicate that the combination of TRAIL with thioridazine overturn TRAIL resistance through Up-regulating the expression of DR5 and down-regulation of AKT protein, and combination treatment with thioridazine and TRAIL may be a novel therapeutic strategy in leukemia.
