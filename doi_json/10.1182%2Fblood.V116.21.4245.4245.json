    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4245 Hepcidin, a transcriptionally regulated peptide hormone, produced by hepatocytes in response to iron overload, decreases intestinal iron absorption and macrophage iron release via effects on ferroportin. Hepcidin is a potential drug target for patients with iron overload syndromes, because its levels are inappropriately low in these patients. Among patients with hereditary hemochromatosis, premenopausal women exhibit less severe iron overload than their male counterparts. While this has been attributed to menstrual blood loss, we hypothesized that estrogens may play a role in regulating Hepcidin expression. We tested estradiol and the phytoestrogens, genistein, apigenin, daizdein, and genistin, for their effects on hepcidin expression in zebrafish embryos. In addition to its estrogenic effects, genistein is known to inhibit multiple protein tyrosine kinases. We found that genistein treatment from 28\u201352 hours post-fertilization in zebrafish embryos enhanced hepcidin transcript levels relative to liver size, as assessed by whole mount in situ hybridization, while estradiol and the other phytoestrogens did not produce a similar effect. To evaluate whether these effects were conserved in human hepatocytes, we treated HepG2 cells with genistein for 24 hours. We found that genistein treatment was associated with a significant increase in Hepcidin transcript levels, which was abrogated by co-treatment with the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling antagonist dorsomorphin, but not by co-treatment with the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780. In conclusion, genistein promotes Hepcidin expression in hepatocytes in a BMP-dependent, but estrogen receptor independent manner. Future experiments will address the signaling pathway by which genistein exerts its effect on Hepcidin expression. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
