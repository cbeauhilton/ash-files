    "abstract_text": "In order to establish an efficient anti-tumor cellular immunotherapy using blood In order to establish an efficient anti-tumor cellular immunotherapy using blood \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, we investigated the in vitro expansion of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the patients with myeloma and lymphoma by the culture of PB-MNC with bisphosphonate and a low dose of IL-2 and we demonstrated the cytotoxic activity of the expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T cells against myeloma/lymphoma cells. Simultaneously we explored the potent methods for enhancing the anti-tumor cytotoxic activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells by both directions of activating the expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and making target tumor cells sensitive to \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. For the activation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were exposed with type I IFN, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DC), or plasmacytoid dendritic cell like cell line PMDC05 (leukemia cell line established from CD4 + CD56 + acute leukemia in our laboratory) for 2 days. For the enhancement of sensitivity of target tumor cell to \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, we aimed to increase the content of IPP (the potent pyrophosphate antigen for \u03b3\u03b4 T cells) in tumor cells by decreasing the metabolic downstream of IPP. For decreasing the downstream of IPP, we tried to suppress FPP synthetase, which is involved in downstream metabolism of IPP, by using nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate. In addition, the expression of stress-induced molecules such as MICA/B on target tumor cells was evaluated in association with the level of cytotoxicity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells against the tumor cells. Compared with normal control, the patients with myeloma (n=8) demonstrated decreased percentage and counts of PB \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Patients with lymphoma (n=7) showed a wide range of values in PB \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, covering a normal range. Amplification rate of PB \u03b3\u03b4 T cells by culture with zoledronate and IL-2 varied markedly from patient to patient up to 120 times in myeloma and 90 times in lymphoma. Expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T cells generated in patients with myeloma/lymphoma were demonstrated to possess the cytotoxic activity against myeloma/lymphoma cells by 51 Cr-release assay and CFSE-labeled target cell. The cytotoxic activity of expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was enhanced by the exposure of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with type I IFN (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2). The activation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, which was evaluated by the elevation of CD69 expression, was observed by the exposure of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with type I IFN, mo-DC, or PMDC05 for 2 days. The sensitivity of target myeloma/lymphoma cells to \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was enhanced by the exposure of the target cells to bisphosphonate such as zoledronate. The expression level of MICA/B on target tumor cells was demonstrated to be associated with the potency of cytotoxicity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells against the tumor cells. The present study demonstrated that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells expanded from myeloma/lymphoma patient\u2019s blood are cytotoxic to myeloma/lymphoma cells. There are two methods practically available for enhancing the cytotoxic activity of expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T cells against myeloma/lymphoma cells, one of which is activating \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and the other is elevating the sensitivity of target cells by using bisphosphonate."
