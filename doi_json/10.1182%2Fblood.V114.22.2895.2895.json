    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2895 Poster Board II-871 Background: Recent studies have reported a significant association between JAK2 V617F acquisition and a specific JAK2 germline haplotype; rs12343867 (located at intron 14 of the JAK2 gene) is one of several SNPs that tag this haplotype. We performed rs12343867 SNP analysis in a consecutive cohort of patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) in order to study the clinical and laboratory correlates of the particular JAK2 haplotype and its effect on survival. Methods: Study patients were recruited form the Mayo Clinic database for PMF. Molecular studies were performed on DNA extracted from stored bone marrow. rs12343867 SNP genotyping was performed by a commercially available Taqman assay. Quantitative JAK2 V617F analysis was done according to previously published methods. Standard statistical methods were used to test significance of associations between SNP genotype and other variables. Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method and comparisons made by the log-rank test. Cox regression model was used for multivariable analysis. Results: 132 patients with PMF were studied (median age 62, range 28-82; 82 males). Risk distribution according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) for PMF were low in 39 (29%) patients, intermediate-1 in 41 (31%), intermediate-2 in 25 (20%) and high in 27 (20%). 77 (58%) patients were JAK2 V617F positive; median mutant allele burden was 26% (range 1-85) and 21 patients displayed > 50% mutant allele burden. The rs12343867 genotype distributions were C/C 22%, C/T 44% and T/T 34% . The corresponding figures in JAK2 V617F positive/negative cases were 31%/9%, 38%/53%, 31%/38% (p=0.01). Among the 21 patients with > 50% JAK2 V617F allele burden, 14 (67%) displayed the C/C allele, 2 C/T and 5 T/T. The specific SNP genotype was not significantly affected by age (p=0.33), sex (p=0.46), leukocyte count (p=0.39), platelet count (p=0.09), or IPSS risk category (p=0.63). Patients were followed for a median of 54 months and during this period 73 (55%) deaths were documented. The T/T SNP genotype was significantly associated with shortened survival, compared to either C/C or C/T (p=0.001; Figure ). Multivariable analysis showed this association to be independent of IPSS, JAK2 V617F mutational status, age or sex. The adverse prognostic effect of the T/T genotype was also apparent when JAK2 V617F negative (p=0.01) or positive (p=0.06) cases were analyzed separately. Conversely, JAK2 mutational status or allele burden did not affect survival in patients with T/T or C/C allele. Conclusion: The current study illustrates the non-random haplotype distribution of JAK2 V617F in patients with PMF. More importantly, a non- JAK2 haplotype, tagged by the rs12343867 T allele, was associated with inferior survival that is not accounted for by IPSS or JAK2 V617F mutational status. These findings, together with previous observations regarding shortened survival associated with low JAK2 V617F allele burden, suggest the presence of molecular events in PMF that are more aggressive than JAK2 V617F and not necessarily linked to the JAK2 haplotype.
