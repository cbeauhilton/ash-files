    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2171 Poster Board II-148 Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia is the prototype of myeloproliferative disorder characterized by a reciprocal chromosomal translocation, involving the chromosomes 9 and 22 \u2014t(9;22)-. The molecular consequence of this translocation is the generation of the Bcr-Abl oncogene that encodes the chimeric Bcr-Abl protein with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Its expression in hematopoietic cells induces uncontrolled and growth factor independent cellular proliferation, alteration in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, resistance to apoptosis which altogether are leukemogenesis landmarks. Although it is well established that Bcr-Abl-expressing leukemic cells are highly resistant to apoptotic cell death induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and a number of signaling molecules have been shown to be activated by the Bcr-Abl kinase, the antiapoptotic pathway/s triggered by this oncogene has not been fully understood. The numerous experimental evidences collected in the last years highlight the crucial role played by alternative splicing in the control of apoptosis. Several pre-mRNAs for cell death factors are alternatively spliced, yielding isoforms with opposing functions during programmed cell death. A clear example is Bcl-x transcript which is alternatively spliced to produce the antiapoptotic Bcl-x(L) or the proapoptotic Bcl-x(S). Identical features are shared by another member of the Bcl-2 family, the myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) gene which encodes two alternative splicing variants MCL-1S and MCL-1L displaying pro- and anti-apoptotic effects, respectively. CML-derived cell lines overexpress the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-x(L) and their erythroid differentiation is inhibited by Bcl-x(L). The data so far collected indicate that there is an extensive cross-talk among BCL-2 family members by virtue of their protein-protein interactions and the ratio of pro-apoptotic to anti-apoptotic proteins has been shown to be a major detereminant of the cell propensity to undergo apoptosis. Furthermore, it is well established that accelerated and blastic phases of the disease are characterized by deregulated WT1 expression. WT1/KTS- gene encodes for a transcription factor but the WT1/KTS+ isoform has been reported to localize into nuclear speckles, the major sub-nuclear structures enriched pre-messenger RNA and splicing factors. Based on the above premise we started investigating the possibility of an active involvement of Bcr-Abl as candidate regulator of splicing events affecting Bcl-x pre-mRNA. By means of an interactomic approach, based on proteomic strategy using GST-Pull Down assay with an array of SH2 containing proteins, we attempted to gain insight into the role played by adapter molecules and Bcr-Abl in splicing assembling machinery. The data presented aims to demonstrate the presence of quaternary complex involving the SH2-SH3 containing adapter protein Nck-beta, the oncogenic tyrosine kinase Bcr-Abl, the RNA binding protein Sam68, the spliceosome ribonucleprotein hnRNPA1 and WT1. The experimental evidences we have collected support the hypothesis of an Imatinib-dependent interaction occurring between Nck-beta and Bcr-Abl. Furthermore, Pull Down experiments indicate an intermolecular interaction between Nck-beta, Sam68, and hnRNPA1 supporting the idea of a novel complex Bcr-Abl/Nck-beta/Sam68/hnRNPA1/WT1. Biochemical analysis carried-out by Pull-Down experiments has been further corroborated by immunofluorescence staining. RNA Pull Down assay suggest that the quaternary complex Nck-beta/Sam68/hnRNPA1/Bcr-Abl/WT1 might modulates splicing process of Bcl-x gene, whose function has been recently described as crucial in myeloproliferative disorders. Astoningshly, the data collected so far indicates that other mRNAs are pulled-down together with the quaternary complex. Taken together these results represent the first experimental evidences showing an interaction between the oncogene Bcr-Abl and Sam-68 leading to speculate a novel putative role played by Bcr-Abl in the intriguing and complex pre-mRNA splicing scenario.
