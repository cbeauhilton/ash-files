    "abstract_text": "All- trans -retinoic acid (ATRA) induces growth inhibition, differentiation and apoptosis in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) characterized by t(15;17), which leads to expression of PML-RARa and differentiation arrest. ATRA treatment alone results in complete remission (CR) about 90% of APL patients. However these remissions are transient and APL patients commonly become resistant to ATRA therapy. Recently, arsenic trioxide, As(2)O(3), was proven to be highly effective in inducing CRs not only in relapsed after ATRA and primary APL patients. Despite the well documented clinical efficacy ATRA and As(2)O(3) in APL, precise downstream molecular mechanisms of action of these agents and the molecular mechanisms responsible for the resistance largely remain unknown. Recently, employing comprehensive proteomics methods we studied molecular mechanisms of ATRA-induced growth inhibition in APL cells. We reported that ATRA induces translational suppression through multiple posttranscriptional mechanisms involved in translation initiation and elongation phases ( Harris &Ozpolat et al, Blood, 104 (5) 2004 ). We also demonstrated that ATRA inhibits expression translation initiation factors including IF2, eIF4AI, eIF4G, eIF5, eIF6 but upregulates expression of translation inhibitor DAP5/p97/NAT1 in APL cells. Translational control of gene expression has been identified as an important regulatory mechanism for gene products involved in regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Programmed cell death 4(PDCD4) inhibits cap-dependent translation and exerts transformation-suppressing activity by inhibiting the helicase activity of eIF4A. . Here we investigated whether PDCD4 plays a role in ATRA-induced growth inhibition and terminal differentiation by mediating translational suppression. We found for the first time that ATRA (1 mM) and As(2)O(3) ( 0.4 mM and 2 mM) induced PDCD4 expression at mRNA and protein level detected by RT-PCR and western blotting analyses, respectively, after 24 h of treatment in NB4 cells. As(2)O(3) induced maximum PDCD4 protein expression at 72 h of treatment in NB4 cells ATRA induced PDCD4 mRNA expression in ATRA responsive human acute myeloid leukemia cells (HL-60) but not in ATRA-resistant HL60 cells (HL-60R), which express a point mutation in ATRA binding domain of RARa, suggesting PDCD4 expression is mediated through retinoid receptor alpha in HL-60 leukemia cells. Overall data suggest that translational control may play a role in ATRA-induced differentiation and As(2)O(3)-induced effects. We are currently determining whether other retinoid receptors are involved in ATRA-induced expression of PDCD4 and testing the hypothesis that whether PDCD4-mediated translational suppression is critical to ATRA-induced APL cell differentiation. Activation of these pathways that lead to translational suppression reveals a novel mechanism of ATRA action and provide novel insights into ATRA-induced differentiation program in APL cells.Better understanding of posttranscriptional control of gene expression may offer targets for the differentiation therapy and chemo preventive strategies.",
