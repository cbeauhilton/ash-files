    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1352 Background: The Arkansas program has emphasized high hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) yields since its inception in 1989, in order to enable further high-dose therapy for relapse, rescue patients from hematopoietic compromise due to extensive cumulative genotoxic or novel agent dosing, and provide a fall-back option in the case MDS develops. Here we are examining the overall outcome data among 3888 patients undergoing HPC-supported therapy since 1989. Patients and Methods: Patients were grouped according to whether they received front-line Total Therapy (TT) protocols (TT-P, n=1452), non-TT protocols for previously treated MM (non-TT-P, n= 1155) or non-protocol therapies (non-P, n=1281). Overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) were measured from the 1 st high-dose therapy (Tx-1) intervention and examined in the context of baseline variables present prior to Tx-1, the aforementioned 3 treatment groups, and intervals between successive Tx interventions. Results: OS/EFS from Tx-1 was longest with TT-P (5-yr estimates, 67%/52%) followed by non-TT-P (5-yr estimates, 43%/30%) and non-P (5-yr estimates, 36%/27%) (p=3.5mg/L for EFS and OS post-Tx-1 and post-Tx-2. Conclusions: We confirm that front-line TT-P provides superior clinical outcomes in comparison with back-up/salvage non-TT-P and non-P Tx, emphasizing the benefit from planned upfront protocol therapy. Timely application of Tx-2 within 6 months of Tx-1 extended both EFS and OS from Tx-2, validating our concept of maximum tumor cyto-reduction and avoiding MM re-growth. Tx-3 was useful when applied beyond 2yr from Tx-2, in support of the notion that longer disease control prior to relapse favorably impacts subsequent salvage Tx.
