    "abstract_text": "Background Treatment of older patients with newly diagnosed AML has been limited by modest response rates with low-intensity therapy and higher levels of toxicity with intensive therapy. We previously reported on a low-intensity backbone of cladribine + LDAC (CLAD/LDAC) alternating with hypomethylating agent (HMA) for older patients with AML, yielding higher rates of CR and improved outcomes compared to HMAs alone. Recently, addition of the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax to HMAs was shown, in a randomized study, to improve survival over HMAs alone. We hypothesized that the addition of venetoclax to the low intensity CLAD/LDAC backbone may further improve response rates and outcomes for this group of patients. Methods This is a phase II clinical trial studying the combination of venetoclax with CLAD/LDAC alternating with 5-azacytidine (AZA) in older (age \u2265 60y) or unfit patients with newly diagnosed AML (excluding APL, CBF). Induction was cladribine 5 mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes on D1-5 followed by araC 20mg SQ BID on D1-10. Consolidation/maintenance consisted of 2 cycles of cladribine 5 mg/m2 IV on D1-3 + araC 20 mg SQ BID on D1-10 alternating with 2 cycles of AZA 75 mg/m2 on D1-7, for up to 18 cycles. Venetoclax 400 mg was added on days 1-21 of each cycle with dose adjustments for concomitant CYP3A inhibitors. One cycle was 4 weeks and up to 2 cycles of induction were allowed. Results A total of 48 patients were treated on study, with a median age of 68 yrs (57-84); 18 (38%) pts were \u2265 70 yrs and 1 pt < 60 yrs who was unfit for intensive chemotherapy was enrolled. 12 (25%) patients had secondary AML (sAML) and 12 (25%) had adverse karyotype. The baseline patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Among 48 evaluable pts, 37 (77%) achieved a complete remission (CR), 8 (17%) had a CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) for a CR/CRi rate of 94%. The median number of cycles to response was 1 (1-3) and 36 (80%) pts were negative for MRD by multi-parameter flow cytometry at the time of CR/CRi. Among the subset of patients who had CR with complete count recovery, the MRD negative rate was 92% (34/37). Among pts with sAML or with adverse karyotype, the CR/CRi rate was 83% (58%/25%) and 83% (50%/33%), respectively. The regimen was well tolerated, with 4- and 8-week mortality rates of 0% and 6%, respectively. The most frequent grade 3/4 non-heme adverse events were neutropenic fever (n=20), lung infection (9), decreased urine output (2), nausea (1), acute kidney injury (1), dizziness (1), and mucositis (1). Eleven (24%) of the 45 responding pts proceeded with allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT). With a median follow-up of 11+ months, the median overall survival (OS) has not been reached (NR), with 6- and 12-month OS rates of 86% and 70%, respectively (Figure 1). The median OS of pts with or without MRD at CR were 10.7m and NR, respectively (P=0.056). For pts with sAML vs. de novo AML, the median OS was 10.6m vs. NR, respectively (P=0.09). OS by cytogenetic risk is shown in Figures 2. OS among different subgroups are summarized in Table. The median RFS was not reached, with 6- and 12-month RFS rates of 79% and 64%, respectively. Conclusion CLAD/LDAC plus venetoclax alternating with AZA plus venetoclax is an effective, lower-intensity regimen that is well tolerated among older patients with newly diagnosed AML, producing high rates of durable MRD negative remission and meaningful blood count recovery. With approximately 1-year follow-up, the rates of overall and relapse-free survival are encouraging in this cohort of older AML patients. Further study of this backbone in combination approaches is warranted.
