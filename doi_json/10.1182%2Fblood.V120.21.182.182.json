    "abstract_text": "Abstract 182 The B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) plays a critical role in the development and progression of B-cell lymphomas. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the existence of stereotyped heavy-chain complementarity determining regions (HCDR3) suggested that binding of external antigens might play a role in CLL pathogenesis. In contrast, we recently reported that BCRs derived from both human CLL patients and from E\u03bc-TCL1tg mice have the unique function to induce antigen-independent signaling. This capacity is mediated by the HCDR3 through binding to a BCR internal motif in adjacent BCRs on the same cell (Du\u0308hren-von Minden et al., Nature 2012). Mature B cells as well as CLL B cells co-express IgM and IgD with the same HCDR3. In this study, we address the respective roles of these expressed BCR classes in lymphoma pathogenesis in E\u03bc-TCL1tg mice and in human CLL. By mating E\u03bc-TCL1tg-mice with IgM \u2212/\u2212 mice, which lacks the \u03bc constant heavy domain (\u03bcCH) and instead expresses IgD in all developmental stages, we demonstrate a significantly lower frequency of CD19 + CD5 + IgM + IgD low lymphoma cells in heterozygous IgM +/\u2212 TCL1 mice compared to conventional IgM +/+ TCL1 mice (p=0.007). Furthermore, IgM +/\u2212 TCL1 mice show a delayed or slowed disease progression compared to TCL1tg mice carrying both IgM alleles. In both TCL1tg mice strains, lymphoma development was exclusively linked to expression of surface IgM, since no IgD single positive lymphoma was detected in IgM +/\u2212 TCL1 mice (n=12). TCL1tg mice that lack both \u03bcCH alleles showed an accumulation of CD19 + CD5 + cells in the spleen at the age of 6 months. According to the genotype of these mice, this population was indeed IgD single positive. However, no further progression could be observed during follow-up to an age of 8 months, indicating a benign form of lymphoproliferation. In contrast to BCRs derived from E\u03bc-TCL1 mice, analysis of the signaling properties of BCRs derived from IgM \u2212/\u2212 TCL1 mice failed to show any autonomous signaling capacity, even when they were expressed as IgM. To address whether IgD in general is able to mediate autonomous signaling reported for TCL1tg- and CLL-derived BCRs, we tested these receptors for autonomous signaling capacity when expressed as IgD. However, expression as IgD led to a complete loss of autonomous signaling capacity in all cases (n=10). In conclusion, whereas autonomous signaling is a characteristic feature of TCL1tg- and CLL-derived BCRs, the pathogenesis of CLL is dependent on the expression of their BCR as the IgM isotype. Expression of IgD-BCRs leads to loss of autonomous signaling capacity, and mice that lack \u03bcCH fail to develop malignant lymphoproliferation. To address the question if differential expression of IgD and IgM also had an impact on the clinical behavior of human CLL, we measured the relative expression levels of surface IgD and IgM on circulating lymphoma cells from 67 CLL patients by flow cytometry with simultaneous staining. According to previous reports (Mockridge et al., Blood 2007), unmutated (UM-CLL) cases (n=22) had a higher level of total surface Ig compared to mutated CLL (M-CLL) cases (n=45). Based on our results that IgM is more potent to drive lymphoproliferation, we calculated the ratio of mean fluorescence intensities for IgD over IgM, further called DvM-Score, for every case. A significant difference in the expression pattern as represented by the DvM-Score was observed for UM-CLL and M-CLL (p=0.003) as well as for ZAP70 + and ZAP70 - cases (p=0.0002). Both UM-CLL cases as well as ZAP70 + cases show a higher amount of IgM compared to IgD represented by a DvM-Score of <1, whereas the majority of M-CLL and ZAP70 \u2212 cases express less IgM than IgD and show a DvM-Score of >1. Based on receiver operating characteristics, an DvM cut-off value of 1.15 was identified to optimally discriminate mutational status (AUC: 0.72) and ZAP70 expression (AUC: 0.78). Preliminary data show that CLL samples with a DvM-Score 1.15 show a median TTFT of 154 months (log rank test, p=0.0014). In summary, our results demonstrate an important role of the BCR class, especially with respect to the pathogenetic role of autonomously active IgM BCRs expressed by CLL B cells, for the outcome of the disease. In addition, the DvM score may represent a convenient and novel prognostic marker for CLL. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
