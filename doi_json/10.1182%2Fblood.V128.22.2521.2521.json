    "abstract_text": "Epstein-Barr virus-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (EBV-HLH) is the most frequent subtype of secondary HLH with infectious triggers. In addition to meet the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria, the diagnosis of EBV-HLH requires the evidence of EBV infection and exclusion of primary HLH and lymphoma-associated HLH. The prognosis of EBV-HLH is generally dismal. To assess the efficacy of current treatment protocols in adult and adolescent patients with EBV-HLH, we retrospectively analyzed 171 HLH patients presented at our institution from March 2009 to April 2016. Of those, 133 patients were EBV-HLH; 35 patients were lymphoma-associated HLH; 3 of 68 patients who underwent genetic test were diagnosed with primary HLH including one with homozygous mutation in UNC13D, one with homozygous mutation in RAB27A , and one with hemizygous mutation in SH2D1A . The rest of the 68 patients exhibited various levels of genetic defects. Of the 133 EBV-HLH patients, 91 male and 42 female cases (2.2:1) were aged between 14 - 77 years with a median age of 26 years. EBV-DNA load on admission was at a median of 6.6 \u00d7 10 5 copies/ml (range: from 5.0 \u00d7 10 3 - 7.8 \u00d7 10 9 copies/ml). One-year mortality rate for them was 66.4%. One hundred and twelve cases were initially treated by HLH-94 or HLH-2004 regimen. Of those, 52 cases (46.4%) had response including 22 cases (19.6%) of complete response (CR) and 30 cases (26.8%) of partial response (PR). Six patients received L-DEP regimen as initial treatment, of which 5 cases had response consisting 3 cases of CR and 2 cases of PR. The overall response rate (ORR) was 83.3%. The rest 15 patients received initial treatment without etoposide, 5 patients (33.3%) achieving PR and 10 patients (66.7%) showing no response. Sixty-nine refractory or relapsed cases received DEP or L-DEP regimen, ORR of which was 79.7%. For those cases, 26 cases received DEP regimen, of which 17 cases (65.4%) had response including 5 cases of CR and 12 cases of PR. Forty-three patients received L-DEP as salvage therapy, of which 38 cases (88.4%) had response including 13 cases of CR (30.2%) and 25 cases of PR (58.1%). Compared to DEP treatment, who received L-DEP had a higher effective rate (65.4% versus 88.4%, p =0.031). Of 133 EBV-HLH patients, only 36 patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the survival rate was 61.1%. In conclusion, EBV-HLH is a fatal disease. Our results indicate DEP or L-DEP is an effective salvage therapy. Additionally, L-DEP may be a more effective therapy than HLH-94/2004 regimen to be used as an initial treatment. Finally, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an effective approach for the treatment of EBV-HLH. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
