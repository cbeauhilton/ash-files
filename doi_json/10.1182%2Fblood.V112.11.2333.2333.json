    "abstract_text": "Following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) from adult peripheral blood (APB), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells are good targets of a graft-versus-leukemia effect. However, some patients eligible for this treatment do not have a suitable allogeneic donor and CLL B cells have been shown to be dysfunctional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for allogeneic APB T cells. As a result, allogeneic APB T cells show suppressed immunological synapse formation with CLL cells. Umbilical cord blood (CB) is a promising source of hematopoietic cells for allogeneic transplantation and can be obtained from matched unrelated donors with greater tolerance for incompletely HLA-matched recipients. Moreover, we have successfully expanded CB T cells ex vivo (anti-CD3/CD28 beads and rIL-2) using a protocol that retains a nai\u0308ve and diverse immune population including central memory cells. In this present study we used confocal microscopy to visualize F-actin polymerization to assess immunological synapse formation of CB T cells compared to APB T cells with CLL B cells with and without superantigen as APCs. Our results identify the ability of unexpanded and expanded CB CD4 and CD8 T cells to form F-actin immune synapses with CLL B cells and of note, CB was more effective than unexpanded or expanded APB T cells (p<0.05). Of interest, the expansion protocol maintained immune synapse formation with a trend towards increased F-actin polymerization. As control, we examined the ability of unexpanded and expanded T cells to form F-actin synapses with allogeneic healthy B cells with or without superantigen as APCs and found no significant difference between CB and APB as a source of T cells. Our results demonstrate that CB T cells have an enhanced ability to recognize CLL B cells as allogeneic APCs compared to APB T cells and provide important and exciting pre-clinical data for the potential use of expanded CB T cells in the setting of CB transplantation in CLL.",
