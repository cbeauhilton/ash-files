    "abstract_text": "X-linked Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC) is a rare recessive disorder caused by mutations in the DKC1 gene that encodes dyskerin. Dyskerin is part of ribonucleoprotein complexes that participate in two different pathways: ribosome biogenesis and telomere maintenance. It is the subject of intense debate whether disease manifestations in DC are due to dysfunctional telomere maintenances or are caused by a defect in ribosome biogenesis. Pathogenic mutations in dyskerin cause telomere shortening and patients with X-linked DC have critically short telomeres, However, whether there is an additional defect in ribosome biogenesis is difficult to investigate. To dissect the impact of a pathogenic dyskerin mutation on telomeres from the possible additional impact on ribosome biogenesis in an in vivo model, we generated mice expressing a mutant dyskerin protein. Because laboratory mice have very long telomeres a short telomere phenotype requires several generations of inbreeding, whereas a phenotype seen in the first generation is likely to be caused by the defect in ribosome biogenesis. To delete the last 21 amino acids of dyskerin (Del15) we used homologous recombination followed by conditional gene deletion in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells and in mice. Six independent ES cell clones with the deleted Dkc1 gene were obtained. In vitro analysis of the ES cells showed that the Del15 mutation led to dramatically decreased expression of a truncated dyskerin protein with decreased accumulation of the telomerase RNA. In addition, both reduction in telomerase activity and significant telomere shortening after 65 passages were observed. These findings indicate that the Del15 mutation impairs the telomerase maintenance pathway. After testing the accumulation of a series of mouse H/ACA snoRNA in Del15 ES cells, we found a decrease of the mU68 and mE1 snoRNAs suggesting the mutation may also confer effects which are outside the telomerase pathway. We therefore went on to produce a line of mice expressing the truncated Dkc1 protein and were able to obtain male mice hemizygous for the mutant Dkc1 gene as well as female heterozgotes. The male mice express the truncated dyskerin protein and show no gross abnormality up to 6 months of age. Interestingly, heterozygous female mice were healthy as well but the truncated dyskerin protein was dramatically decreased in expression compared to the wild type dyskerin in spleen, thymus, and bone marrow, but not in liver and brain. This result must derive from preferential proliferation of cells expressing wild type dyskerin after random X-inactivation in early embryogenesis. Our analysis indicates that the mutant dyskerin impairs the proliferation in hematopoietic tissues while it does not affect cells which are not rapidly proliferating such as those in liver and brain. Because of the early appearance of the skewed X-inactivation phenotype we conclude that skewing in these mice is caused by a telomere independent mechanism. Interestingly, the lack of overt DC-like abnormalities in the male hemizygous mice indicates that this proliferative disadvantage is insufficient to cause bone marrow failure but in combination with impaired telomere maintenance may accelerate the onset and severity of disease and thus explain the earlier and more severe manifestation in X-linked DC compared to autosomal dominant DC which only affects the telomerase pathway."
