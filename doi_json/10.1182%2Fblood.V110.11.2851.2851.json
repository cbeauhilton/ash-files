    "abstract_text": "Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a special subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) which is characterized for a specific translocation between chromosome 15 and 17 [t(15;17)] and the expression of PML/RAR\u03b1 fusion gene. Celecoxib, one of the specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), has been reported to induce anti-neoplastic activity on many solid human tumor cell lines in recent years. In our study, ATRA resistant APL cell line MR2 cells were used to investigate the effects of celecoxib on hematological malignancy. MR2 cells were treated with celecoxib at different concentration (0, 20, 40, 80, 120 and 160\u03bcmol/L). The proliferation of MR2 cells was observed by MTT assay and apoptosis was detected by DNA fragmentation analysis and flow cytometry using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Western blot was used to detect the change of caspase-8, -9, -3 and PARP in MR2 cells. The expression of mRNA of fusion gene PML/RAR\u03b1, COX-2 and survivin, bcl-2/bax, CIAP1 and CIAP2 was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cell cycle analyzed by flow cytometry with PI staining and western blot was used to detect the expression of cell-cycle-regulating proteins. The telomerase activity of MR2 cells was analyzed by PCR-ELISA. The expression of hTERT mRNA and c-myc mRNA was assessed by RT-PCR. MR2 cells viability in presence of celecoxib decreased markedly in a dose- and time- dependent manner. After treated with celecoxib (20-160\u03bcmol/L) for 12-48h, the proliferation of MR2 cells were inhibited significantly, in comparison with the control group (P<0.01). 50% growth inhibition (IC50) at 24h and 48h was 80.93\u03bcmol/L and 71.72\u03bcmol/L, respectively. A DNA ladder pattern of internucleosomal fragmentation was observed. The translocation of phosphatidylserine at the outer surface of the cell plasma membrane could be induced by celecoxib and its level increased following the augmentation of the drug concentration. MR2 cells exposure to 40-160\u03bcmol/L celecoxib for 24h caused 9.59%, 24.00%, 36.10% apoptotic cells, which was more than that of the untreated group 2.84% (P<0.01). The expression of survivin mRNA decreased dramatically, while no significant change with PML/RAR\u03b1 and COX-2. Treatment with celecoxib for 24h resulted in the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, cleavage of PARP. 40-160\u03bcmol/L celecoxib led to cell cycle arrest in G1/S phase, and CyclinD1 and CyclinE decreased, accompanied with up-regulation of P21waf/cip1, P27KIP, P16INK4a. celecoxib could inhibit the telomerase activity of APL cell line, and the inhibition was dose- and time- dependent. The expression of hTERT mRNA and c-myc mRNA were down-regulated by celecoxib in dose- dependent manner. These results indicated that celecoxib could inhibit MR2 cells proliferation by inducing apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and suppression of telomerase activity."
