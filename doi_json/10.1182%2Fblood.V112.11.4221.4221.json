    "abstract_text": "We show the molecular and functional characterization of a novel population of lineage-negative CD34-negative (Lin \u2212 CD34 \u2212 ) hematopoietic stem cells from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients at diagnosis. Molecular caryotyping and quantitative analysis of BCR-ABL transcript demonstrated that about one third of CD34 \u2212 cells are leukemic. CML Lin \u2212 CD34 \u2212 cells showed kinetic quiescence and limited clonogenic capacity. However, stroma-dependent cultures induced CD34 expression on some cells, cell cycling, acquisition of clonogenic activity and increased expression of BCR-ABL transcript. Lin \u2212 CD34 \u2212 cells showed hematopoietic cell engraftment rate in immunodeficient mice similar to Lin-CD34 + cells whereas endothelial cell engraftment was significantly higher. Gene expression profiling revealed the down-regulation of cell cycle arrest genes, genes involved in antigen presentation and processing, while the expression of genes related to tumor progression, such as angiogenic factors, was strongly up-regulated when compared to normal counterparts. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed the significant down-regulation of HLA class I and II molecules in CML Lin \u2212 CD34 \u2212 cells. Imatinib mesilate did not reduce fusion transcript levels, BCR-ABL kinase activity and clonogenic efficiency of CML Lin \u2212 CD34 \u2212 cells in vitro. Moreover, leukemic CD34 \u2212 cells survived to BCR-ABL inhibitors in vivo . Thus, we identified a novel CD34 \u2212 leukemic stem cell subset in CML with peculiar molecular and functional characteristics."
