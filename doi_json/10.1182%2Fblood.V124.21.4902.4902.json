    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Adults with transfusion dependent thalassemia syndromes are living into later adulthood as a result of better transfusion therapy and chelation. Unfortunately, chronic health problems develop in these patients that persist into adulthood. Osteoporosis and osteopenia are significant co-morbidities in the thalassemia population as a result of impaired growth in childhood, extramedullary expansion of the marrow, iron deposition, vitamin D deficiencies, and hypogonadism. The morbidity of osteoporosis is significant in this population, leading to fractures and chronic pain. The purpose of this study was to provide a cross-sectional descriptive analysis of bone disease in adult thalassemia patients with osteoporosis and fracture histories. Methods : A retrospective review of electronic medical records was carried out from patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (>8 transfusions per year) seen at the Weill Cornell Comprehensive Thalassemia Center. Information on demographics, diagnosis, iron assessment, and co-existing medical conditions was collected. Results of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans as well as urine and serum markers of bone turnover were also obtained (C-telopeptide (CTX), N-telopeptide (NTX), bone alkaline phosphatase (AP)). The prevalence of fractures was collected. Results : We identified 65 adult patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (median age = 36.8, range 16-56; 41 female, 24 male). Thirteen patients had diagnosed thalassemia intermedia (TI), one patient had hemoglobin Lepore, one patient had alpha-thalassemia major, and one patient had Hemoglobin E/beta thalassemia. The remaining patients (n = 49) had thalassemia major. 98% of patients (n=64) were on chelation therapy, the median liver iron content (LIC) was 2.821 mg/g dw (range 0.5 \u2013 135) with a median T2* on cardiac MRI of 34.5 msec (range 7-49 msec). Based on T score 41 had a prevalence of 66.7%; p=0.001). Conclusions : Osteoporosis remains a significant problem in the adult transfusion-dependent thalassemia population, and often begins in young adulthood. A fracture history is significantly associated with decreased DEXA T scores. Bone turnover markers decrease with age, which may reflect decreased remodeling or increased use of bone-sparing treatments. A fracture history was far more common in patients over the age of 40. Improved treatments for transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients with osteoporosis should be a high priority for future research. Disclosures Chapin: Novo-Nordisk: Honoraria; Alexion: Honoraria.
