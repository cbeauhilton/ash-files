    "abstract_text": "Aberrantly expressed self-antigens in leukemic cells serve as leukemia-associated-antigens (LAAs) of leukemia reactive T cells. Although such self-antigen-derived LAAs potentially induce high avidity CTLs in patients with leukemia, these CTLs usually do not persist due to apoptosis upon encountering leukemic cells. In allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) recipients with leukemia, residual leukemic cell may sensitize donor-derived T cells by LAA in vivo and induce high avidity CTLs specific to leukemic cells. Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is a cell cycle regulator protein that is aberrantly expressed in AML, MDS, ALL and MCL cells. We previously reported that CDK2-derived nonamer peptides (CDK2 158 : TYTHEVVTL, CDK2 167 : WYRQPEILL, CDK2 178 : KYYSTAVDI) avidly bound to HLA-A24 molecule to elicit each peptide-specific CTL from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy individuals (Blood. 106 (11): a3103. 2005). When we generated CDK2 158 -specific CD8 + T cells from an HLA identical sibling donor of a patient with AML by stimulating donor PBMCs with CDK2 158 -coated HLA-A24-transfected T2, CDK2 158 -specific CD8 + T cells preferentially killed the recipient AML cells which aberrantly expressed CDK2 proteins. The percentages of specific lysis in the 51 Cr-release assay at an E/T ratio of 40 were 36.8% for AML cells and 24.8% for autologous PBMCs. To determine if CDK2-specific CD8 + T cells are present in PBMCs from allo-SCT patients, we studied 14 patients possessing HLA-A24 [6 patients with AML (2 AML-M0, 3 AML-M2, 1 AML with multilinage dysplasia), 1 with MDS, 1 with CML, 2 with ALL, 2 with MCL and 2 with RCC] using CDK2 158 /A24 and CDK2 178 /A24 multimers. Cryopreserved PBMCs obtained before and 4\u201373 months after allo-SCT were assayed for multimer staining. The source of graft was unrelated BM in 4, related BM in 2, related PBMC in 3 and CB in 5 patients. All CB and 1 BM graft were HLA mismatched. Seven patients were in complete remission (CR) at the time of SCT while 7 were in non-CR. Ten patients remained in CR 4\u201379 months after SCT. Small populations (0.13\u20130.77 % of lymphocyte) of CDK2 158 and CDK2 178 -specific CTL were detectable in 5 patients (3 with AML-M2, 1 with CML and 1 with ALL) 10\u201373 months after SCT. All of the 5 remained in CR 11\u201379 months after SCT. Only one of them had active cGvHD at sampling. On the other hand, among 7 patients who did not show an increase in the proportion of neither CDK2 158 nor CDK2 178 -specific CTLs, 2 patients with AML-M0 relapsed 4 and 5 months after SCT, respectively. Both of them had active cGvHD at sampling. CDK2-specific CTLs were also undetectable in 2 patients with RCC after allo-SCT. These data provide evidence for the first time that CDK2-specific CTLs can be induced from donor-derived T cells without peptide immunization possibly due to in vivo sentitization of donor T cells by residual leukemic cells. Vaccination with CDK2-derived peptides after allo-SCT may therefore be useful in inducing CDK2-specific CTLs and thereby preventing relapse of leukemia.
