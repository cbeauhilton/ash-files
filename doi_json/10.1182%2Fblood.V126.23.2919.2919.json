    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION. Although uncommon, involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) is the most common extramedullary manifestation of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). Nonetheless, a broad array of conditions can lead to neurologic symptoms in CLL patients and distinguishing between clinically significant CLL involvement of the CNS and other etiologies can be challenging. The actual prevalence of CNS involvement by CLL is unknown, the only available data being case reports and small case series. METHODS. Between 01/1995 and 11/2014, 186 of the 4317 (4%) patients with CLL followed at our center underwent an MRI of the CNS (e.g. brain, spine) and/or a lumbar puncture (LP) with cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis to evaluate neurologic symptoms. As the mere presence of CLL cells in the CSF is not diagnostic of clinically significant CNS disease, a final diagnosis of clinically significant CNS involvement by CLL was established by the collaborative review of the pathologist, neurologist and treating hematologist based on comprehensive work-up and multi-disciplinary evaluation. RESULTS. After evaluation, the etiology of neurologic symptoms was clinically significant involvement of the CNS by CLL in 19 (10%) patients, CNS Richter Syndrome (RS) in 15 (8%), infection in 42 (23%), autoimmune conditions in 31 (17%), other cancer in 9 (5%), and another etiology in 70 (37%). The sensitivity of LP to detect clinically significant CNS involvement by CLL was 89%, however its specificity was only 42% where CLL cells were also frequently observed in the CSF in concomitance with inflammatory processes, such as infections and autoimmune disease. Factors associated with clinically significant CNS involvement by CLL/RS were mutated IGHV (p=0.04), low CSF glucose (p=0.02), elevated CSF total nucleated cells (TNC)(p=0.004), lymphocytes (p=0.02) and CLL cells, both as absolute count (p=0.05) and percentage of TNC (p=0.02). Median OS among patients with clinically significant CNS involvement by CLL or RS were 21 and 11 months, respectively. Median OS for patients with neurological symptoms secondary to infection was 6 months, to autoimmune process was 63 months, to other cancers was 19 months, and to other non-CLL related etiologies was 37 months. CONCLUSIONS. Clinically significant CNS involvement by CLL and RS are rare conditions. Neurologic symptoms in patients with CLL are attributable to non-CLL-related etiologies in the majority of cases, even when CLL B-cells are present in the CSF. Analysis of the CSF has high sensitivity but limited specificity to distinguish clinically significant CNS involvement by CLL from other etiologies. Comprehensive evaluation is required before attributing neurologic symptoms to CLL. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
