    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1210 Background: BCR-ABL1 transforms hematopoietic stem cells to induce chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP). Although CML is stem cell-derived, it is a progenitor cell-driven disease. In CML-CP, leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are characterized by elevated BCR-ABL1 expression in comparison to leukemia progenitor cells (LPCs). Increased expression of BCR-ABL1 kinase is also associated with progression from CML-CP to CML-blast phase. Previously we showed that BCR-ABL1 kinase stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent DNA damage resulting in genomic instability in vitro , which was responsible for acquired imatinib-resistance and accumulation of chromosomal aberrations ( Nowicki et al., Blood, 2005; Koptyra et al., Blood, 2006; Koptyra et al., Leukemia, 2008 ). Result: To examine the effects of BCR-ABL1 expression on genomic instability during in vivo leukemogenesis we employed an inducible transgenic mouse model of CML-CP with targeted expression of p210BCR-ABL1 in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( Koschmieder et al., Blood, 2005 ). Mice exhibiting CML-CP-like disease resulting from BCR-ABL1 induction demonstrated splenomegaly, leukocytosis, and Gr1 + /CD11b + myeloid expansion in bone marrow, spleen and peripheral blood, as detected by FACS analysis. BCR-ABL1 mRNA expression was higher in Lin - c-Kit + Sca1 + stem-enriched cells than in Lin - c-Kit + Sca1 - progenitor-enriched cells, thus reminiscent of CML-CP (LSCs>LPCs). BCR-ABL1 increased levels of ROS (hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical) and oxidative DNA lesions (8-oxoG) in LSC-enriched Lin - c-Kit + Sca1 + cells. Preliminary data also suggested that quiescent (CFSE max ) Lin - c-Kit + Sca1 + cells from BCR-ABL1-induced mice exhibited greater ROS (superoxide) production than non-induced counter parts. Moreover, higher levels of ROS were detected in BCR-ABL1-positive Lin - c-Kit + Sca1 + stem-enriched population in comparison to BCR-ABL1-positive Lin - c-Kit + Sca1 - progenitor population, suggesting a dosage-dependent effect of BCR-ABL1. To confirm that BCR-ABL1 exerts a dosage-dependent effect on ROS-induced oxidative DNA damage, we showed that the levels of ROS, 8-oxoG and DNA double-strand breaks were proportional to BCR-ABL1 kinase expression in murine 32Dc13 and human CD34 + cells. Conclusion: In summary, this mouse model recapitulates the BCR-ABL1 expression profile attributed to stem and progenitor populations in human CML-CP. It also shows that the BCR-ABL1-positive, stem cell-enriched Lin - c-Kit + Sca1 + population displays elevated levels of ROS and oxidative DNA damage in comparison to normal counterparts, which makes it suitable to study the mechanisms of genomic instability in LSCs. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays will shed more light on the genomic instability of this BCR-ABL1-induced transgenic model of CML-CP.
