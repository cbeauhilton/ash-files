    "abstract_text": "Background CD30 was expressed in about 40% diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), epically in activated B cell subtype DLBCL(ABC-DLBCL) and implied superior outcome. however, the underlying mechanisms remains unclear. Methods Three ABC-DLBCL cell lines (SuDHL2, TMD8, HBL1) were used for construction of stably CD30 expression cell lines. The proliferation of these cell lines was measured by MTT assay. Cell cycles were detected by Flow Cytometry after staining with PI. Expression of CyclinD1, p27, CDK2, ERK, phosphorylation-ERK, p38, phosphorylation p38 was detected by Western Blot. Nude mice were used in vivo study. Results With CD30 overexpression, the proliferation and division of SuDHL2, TMD8 and HBL1 cell lines were promoted. CyclilnD1, CDK2 were upregulated and p27 was downregulated after of CD30 overexpression. Furthermore, CD30 was knock down by treated CD30 shRNA in CD30 overexpression cell lines. CD30 KD could reverse the the proliferation induced by CD30 expression. CD30 overexpression increased the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 in ABC-DLBCL cells. In vivo study, CD30 overexpression was correlated with cell proliferation and division. Conclusion Taken together, our date showed CD30 promotes proliferation and division by activating ERK 1/2 and p38 MAPK signal pathways, and targeting CD30 may be a novel therapeutic approach for improving the effectiveness of chemotherapy in ABC-DLBCLs.
