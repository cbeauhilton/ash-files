    "abstract_text": "Somatic mutations in the ER chaperone calreticulin ( CALR ) are frequent and disease-initiating in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Although the mechanism of mutant CALR-induced MPN is known to involve pathogenic binding between mutant CALR and MPL, this insight has not yet been exploited therapeutically. Consequently, a major deficiency is the lack of clonally selective therapeutic agents with curative potential. Hence, we set out to discover and validate unique genetic dependencies for mutant CALR-driven oncogenesis. We first performed a whole-genome CRISPR knockout screen in CALR \u039452 MPL-expressing hematopoietic cells to identify genes that were differentially required for the growth of cytokine-independent, transformed CALR \u0394 52 cells as compared to control cells. Using gene-set enrichment analyses, we identified the N -glycan biosynthesis, unfolded protein response, and the protein secretion pathways to be amongst the most significantly differentially depleted pathways (FDR q values <0.001, 0.014, and 0.025, respectively) in CALR \u0394 52 cells. We performed a secondary CRISPR pooled screen focused on significant pathways from the primary screen and confirmed these findings. Strikingly, seven of the top ten hits in both screens were linked to protein N -glycosylation. Four of those genes encode proteins involved in the enzymatic activity of dolichol-phosphate mannose synthase (DPM1, DPM2, DPM3, and MPDU1). This enzyme synthesizes dolichol D-mannosyl phosphate, an essential substrate for protein N -glycosylation. Importantly, these findings from an unbiased whole-genome screen align with prior mechanistic studies demonstrating that both the N -glycosylation sites on MPL and the lectin-binding sites on CALR \u0394 52 are required for mutant CALR-driven oncogenesis. We next performed single gene CRISPR Cas9 validation studies and found that DPM2 is required for CALR \u0394 52 -mediated transformation, as demonstrated by increased cell death, reduced p-STAT5 and decreased MPL cell-surface levels, when Dpm2 is knocked out. Importantly, cells cultured in cytokine-rich medium were unaffected by DPM2 loss. Upon cytokine withdrawal, a sub-clone of non-edited Dpm2 WT CALR \u0394 52 cells grew out, further demonstrating requirement for DPM2 for the survival of CALR \u0394 52 cells. Additionally, we observed a >50% reduction in ex vivo myeloid colony formation of murine Calr \u0394 52  Dpm2 ko bone marrow (BM) compared with CRISPR-Cas9 non-targeting controls, with non-significant effects on Calr WT BM cells. To enable clinical translation, we performed a pharmacological screen targeting pathways significantly depleted in our CRISPR screens. Screening 70 drugs, we found that the N -glycosylation pathway was the only pathway in which all tested compounds preferentially killed CALR \u0394 52 transformed cells. We then treated primary Calr \u0394 52/+ mice with a clinical grade N -glycosylation ( N -Gi) inhibitor and found platelet counts (Sysmex) to be significantly reduced (vehicle 3x10 6 /mL, N -Gi 1x10 6 /mL after 18 days, p<.0001). Concordantly, the proportion of megakaryocyte erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs) was significantly reduced in Calr \u0394 52 BM (p=0.03). We next performed competitive BM transplantation assays using CD45.2 UBC-GFP MxCre Calr \u0394 52 knockin and CD45.1 mice. We found that mice treated with N -Gi had significantly reduced platelet counts (vehicle 1440x10 6 /mL, N -Gi 845x10 6 /mL, p=0.005) as well as significantly reduced platelet chimerism (vehicle 55%, N -Gi 27%, p<0.001), indicating a distinct vulnerability of Calr \u0394 52 over WT cells. Finally, we interrogated RNA-sequencing data from primary human MPN platelets. We found N -glycosylation-related pathways to be significantly upregulated in CALR -mutated platelets (n = 13) compared to healthy control platelets (n = 21), highlighting the relevance of our findings to human MPN. In summary, using unbiased genetic and focused pharmacological screens, we identified the N -glycan biosynthesis pathway as essential for mutant CALR-driven oncogenesis. Using a pre-clinical MPN model, we found that in vivo inhibition of N -glycosylation normalizes key features of MPN and preferentially targets Calr \u0394 52 over WT cells. These findings have therapeutic implications through inhibiting N -glycosylation alone or in combination with other agents to advance the development of clonally selective therapeutic approaches in CALR- mutant MPN.
