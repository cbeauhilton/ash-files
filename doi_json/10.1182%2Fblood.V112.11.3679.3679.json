    "abstract_text": "As multiple myeloma tumors universally dysregulate cyclin D genes we conducted high-throughput chemical library screens for compounds that inhibit signaling pathways driving cyclin D2 promoter transactivation, assaying more than 4,000 compounds. The top-ranked compound from these studies was a natural triterpenoid, pristimerin. Pristimerin markedly suppressed cyclin D2 promoter activity (>90%) in 3T3 fibroblast cells and inhibited cyclin D1, D2 and D3 protein expression in myeloma tumor cells. Strikingly, the early (4 hour) transcriptional response of myeloma cells treated with pristimerin closely resembles cellular responses elicited by proteosome inhibitors ( P <10 \u22129 ) (Connectivity Map Build 2, www.broad.mit.edu/cmap ), with rapid induction of heat shock proteins (HSP70 >90-fold), activating transcription factor (ATF) 3 and CHOP. Enzymatic assays performed with purified 20S proteosome, or with total cellular extract, confirm that pristimerin rapidly and specifically inhibits chymotrypsin-like 20S proteosome activity at low concentration (6 hours. Consistent with inhibition of proteosome function, pristimerin causes rapid and sustained accumulation of high molecular weight poly-ubiquitinated protein in myeloma cell lines. Notably, related cytotoxic triterpenoid drugs, such as the methyl ester of 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO-Me, RTA 402) or betulinic acid or the ginsenosides - all of which show promising anti-cancer activities and are currently in clinical trials for advanced lymphoma, leukemia or solid malignancies - commonly inhibit NF-kB activation via direct inhibition of IKK\u03b1 or IKK\u03b2. In contrast drugs that function as proteosome inhibitors also commonly suppress NF-kB function instead by impairing degradation of ubiquitinated IkB. Immunoblotting for phosphorylated IkB confirms that pristimerin, like other triterpenoids, acts upstream of IkB to inhibit its phosphorylation, although pristimerin simultaneously inhibits proteosome activity with marked potency to diminish the clearance of ubiquitinated IkB. As a result of this two-fold stabilization of IkB, pristimerin causes overt and specific suppression of NF-kB mediated transcription, measured by a panel of transcriptional reporters with synthetic promoters containing 5x repeats of generic binding sites for NF-kB, AP-1, CREB or TCF4. Importantly, specific suppression of constitutive NF-kB transcriptional activity was pronounced in myeloma cells with inherent NF-kB pathway activation resulting from bi-allelic deletion of the TRAF3 tumor suppressor. Constitutive activation of the NF-kB pathway occurs in a significant proportion of primary myeloma tumors, most commonly via inactivation of TRAF3. Selective silencing of NF-kB driven transcription in myeloma cells may mediate the potent suppression of cyclin D proteins induced by this compound. Significantly, multiple myeloma cells are exquisitely sensitive to both proteosome inhibition or NFkB pathway inhibition. Consistent with these twin vulnerabilities, pristimerin is potently and selectively lethal to primary myeloma cells from patients (IC 50 <100nM) grown in mixed lineage culture and inhibits the growth of xenografted human plasmacytoma tumors grown in mice, providing a strong rationale for pharmaceutical development of triterpenoid dual-function proteosome-plus-NF-kB pathway inhibitors as therapeutics for multiple myeloma and related human malignancies.",
