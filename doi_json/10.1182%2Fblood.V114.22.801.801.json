    "abstract_text": "Abstract 801 Intrinsic defects in the apoptotic circuitry underlie to a large extent the extended survival of malignant B cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and are moreover believed to be responsible for their resistance to chemotherapy. We have recently demonstrated that p66Shc, a member of Shc family of protein adapters, acts as a promoter of apoptosis in T cells. Here we show that p66Shc uncouples the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) from the Erk and Akt dependent survival pathways, thereby enhancing B-cell apoptosis. Expression of p66Shc was found to be profoundly and consistently impaired in CLL B cells compared to peripheral blood B cells form healthy donors. Moreover, significant differences in p66Shc expression were observed in patients with favorable or unfavorable prognosis, classified on the basis of the mutational status of the IGHV genes, with the lowest expression in the unfavorable prognosis group. Analysis of the expression of genes previously implicated in the apoptosis defects of CLL B cells revealed a selective alteration in the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family in these patients. Reconstitution experiments in CLL B cells, as well as data obtained on B cells from p66Shc-/- mice, showed that p66Shc expression correlates with a bias in the Bcl-2 family towards the pro-apoptotic members. Collectively, the data identify p66Shc as a novel regulator of B cell apoptosis which attenuates survival signals emanating from the BCR and modulates expression of the Bcl-2 family. They moreover provide evidence that the defect in p66Shc expression identified in CLL B cells may be causally related to the imbalance towards the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members observed in these cells.
