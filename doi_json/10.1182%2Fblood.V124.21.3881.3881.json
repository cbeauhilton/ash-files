    "abstract_text": "Objective: To compare outcome, disease-free survival and rejection in aplastic anaemia patients receiving: (A) ALG or ATG plus cyclophosphamide (CY) 200 mg/Kg ; (B) Fludarabine 120 mg/m 2 , ATG plus CY 300 mg/m 2 and (C) Fludarabine 120 mg/m 2 , ATG plus CY 120 mg/Kg conditioning regimens. Patients & Methods: The study included 202 consecutive aplastic anaemia patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from HLA matched sibling donors at this centre from July 2001 to April 2014. Overall 122 had very severe aplastic anemia, 76 severe and 4 non-severe aplastic anemia. Group A, B and C were compared for outcome, disease free survival and rejection. The stem cell source was bone marrow (39.6%); PBSC (7.9%) or both bone marrow plus PBSC (51.5%). GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine (51% cases) and cyclosporine plus methotrexate (45.5% case). Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables. Two way ANOVA was used to compare group means. Kaplan Meier survival curves with log rank test was applied to compare the groups for survival analysis. Results: Group A included 99, group B 72 and group C 31 patients. Male to female ratio was 76/23 in group A; 56/16 in group B and 22/9 in group C. Median age of patients in group A, B and C were 16, 22 and 18 years respectively (p=0.001). At a median follow up of 1267 days the overall and disease free survival were 76.7% and 68.7% in group A, 70.8% and 69.4% in group B, 67.7% and 54.8% in group C (p=0.350, and p=0.412 respectively). The rejection rate was 11.1%, 9.7% and 35.5% in group A, B and C respectively (p=0.001). Frequency of chronic GVHD was 10%, 8% and 35.5 in respective groups (p<0.001). There was no significant difference between the groups for disease severity, gender and ABO mismatch, stem cell source and GVHD prophylaxis. Conclusion: Conditioning regimens using ALG or ATG with Cy 200 mg/kg; and Fludarabine 120 mg/m 2 , ATG plus Cy 120 mg/kg give comparable results while the regimen using Fludarabine 120 mg/m 2 , ATG plus Cy 300 mg/m 2 is associated with high rejection rate and inferior survival in aplastic anemia following allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
