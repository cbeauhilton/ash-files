    "abstract_text": "Integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 exists in a low affinity state in resting platelets and requires activation for high affinity binding with soluble ligands. Activation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is tightly linked to structural rearrangements of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 molecule that is initiated from the cytoplasmic tails of the \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 subunits. The \u03b23 membrane-distal region has been shown to interact with many signaling and cytoskeletal molecules, and considered as a trigger point of integrin activation. The interaction of the \u03b23 tail with a cytoplasmic protein, talin, largely contributes to integrin activation. In view of the link between integrin activation and allosteric structural rearrangements of integrins, one would expect that structural changes in the \u03b23 membrane-distal region containing binding sites for intracellular proteins would be relayed to the membrane-proximal region, leading to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation. However, there has been no evidence that structural rearrangement of the \u03b23 membrane-distal region is directly linked to integrin activation. No activating mutation has so far been reported in the \u03b23 membrane-distal region despite numerous reports of loss-of-function mutants in this region. In this context, a previously reported \u03b1IIb\u03b23 mutant in which the \u03b23 tail was replaced by the \u03b21 tail was noteworthy. This chimeric integrin, \u03b1IIb\u03b23/\u03b21, was constitutively active. Because the \u03b21 and \u03b23 subunits have relatively high sequence homology in their membrane-proximal regions, we reasoned that the residues differing between the \u03b21 and \u03b23 membrane-distal regions may be responsible for \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation. To identify such residues, we produced 13 \u03b1IIb\u03b23 mutants in which the individual or group residues in the \u03b23 tail were substituted with the corresponding \u03b21 tail residues. The \u03b1IIb\u03b23 mutants were expressed on the surface of CHO cells by cotransfection of mutant \u03b23 and wild-type \u03b1IIb cDNAs, and were tested for binding of fibrinogen and PAC1, a ligand-mimetic anti-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 antibody. Among them, only \u03b23I719M and E749S mutants bound significant PAC1 and fibrinogen binding without any stimulation and the RGDS peptide abolished binding of these ligands, indicating a constitutively active state. The similar effect was observed with I719A and E749A mutants. Moreover, the I719M/E749S double mutant showed more PAC1 binding than the single mutants, reaching the same ligand binding activity as \u03b1IIb\u03b23/\u03b21. These \u03b23 mutations also induced \u03b1V\u03b23 activation. Conversely, substitution of M719 or S749 in the \u03b21 tail with the corresponding \u03b23 tail residue (M719I or S749E) inhibited \u03b1IIb\u03b23/\u03b21 activation, and the M719I/S749E double mutant inhibited ligand binding to a level comparable with that of the wild-type \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Knock down of talin by short hairpin RNA inhibited the I719M- and E749S-induced \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation, indicating talin-mediated activation of mutant integrins. Since I719 is located at the \u03b23 membrane-proximal region, it is likely that the I719 mutation disrupts the well-known membrane-proximal clasp to maintain integrins at a low affinity state. On the other hand, E749 is located at the \u03b23 membrane-distal region. This result provides experimental evidence that structural perturbation of the \u03b23 membrane-distal region is linked to integrin activation. Moreover, our result showed that the mutational effects of the membrane-proximal I719 and the membrane-distal E749 residues were additive and talin-dependent, suggesting that the \u03b23 membrane-proximal and \u2013distal regions cooperatively regulate talin-mediated \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation. This finding is consistent with a recent model of talin-induced \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation in which talin cooperatively interacts with the \u03b23 membrane-proximal and distal regions.",
