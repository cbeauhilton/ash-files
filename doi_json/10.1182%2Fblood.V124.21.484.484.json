    "abstract_text": "Background: AML is a heterogeneous disease. The karyotype provides important prognostic information that influences therapy and outcome. Identification of AML patients (pts) with poor prognosis such as those with complex karyotype (CK) has great interest and impact on therapeutic strategies. TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human tumours. TP53 mutation rate in AML was reported to be low (2.1%), but the incidence of TP53 mutations in AML with a complex aberrant karyotype is still debated. Aims: To investigate the frequency of TP53 mutations in adult AML pts, the types of mutations, the associations with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities and their relationship with response to therapy, clinical outcome and finally their prognostic role. To this aim, we focused on a subgroup of TOT/886 AML pts treated at the Ser\u02c6gnoli Institute of Bologna between 2002 and 2013. Patients and Methods : 886 AML patients were analysed for morphology, immunophenotype, cytogenetic and for a panel of genetic alterations ( FLT3, NPM1, DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2 mutations, WT-1 expression , CBF fusion transcripts). Of these, 172 adult AML pts were also examined for TP53 mutations using several methods, including Sanger sequencing, Next-Generation Deep-Sequencing (Roche) and HiSeq 2000 (Illumina) platform. 40 samples were genotyped with Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 arrays or with CytoScan HD Array (Affymetrix) and analysed by Nexus Copy Number\u00aa v7.5 (BioDiscovery). Results: Of the 886 AML patients, 172 pts were screened for TP53 mutations. Sanger sequencing analysis detected TP53 mutations in 29/172 AML patients with 36 different types of mutations; seven pts (4%) had 2 mutations. At diagnosis , the median age of TP53 mutated and wild type patients was 68 years (range 42-86), and 65 years (range 22-97) respectively. Median WBC count was 8955/mmc (range 580-74360/mmc) and 1240/mmc (range 400-238000/mmc). Conventional cytogenetics showed that: a) 52 pts (30,2%) had 3 or more chromosome abnormalities, i.e. complex karyotype; b) 71 (41,3%) presented with one or two cytogenetic abnormalities (other-AML); c) 34 pts (19,8%) had normal karyotype. Most of the TP53 mutated pts (23/29, 79.3%) had complex karyiotype, whereas only 6/29 mutated pts had \u201cno complex Karyotype\u201d (21% and 3% of the entire screened population, respectively). Overall, TP53 frequency was 44.2% in the complex karyotype group, suggesting a pathogenetic role of TP53 mutations in this subgroup of leukemias. As far as the types of TP53 alterations regards, the majority of mutations (32) were deleterious.. Copy Number Alterations (CNAs) analysis performed on 40 cases by Affymetrix SNP arrays showed the presence of several CNAs in all cases: they ranged from loss or gain of the full chromosome (chr) arm to focal deletions and gains targeting one or few genes involving macroscopic (>1.5 Mbps), submicroscopic genomic intervals (50 Kbps - 1.5 Mbps) and LOH (>5 Mbps) events. Of relevance, gains located on chr 8 were statistically associated with TP53 mutations (p = 0.001). In addition to the trisomy of the chr 8, others CNAs, located on chromosomes 5q, 3, 12, 17 are significantly associated (p = 0.05) with TP53 mutations. WES analysis was performed in 37 pts: 32 TP53 were wt while 5 pts were TP53 mutated. Interestingly, TP53 mutated patients had more incidence of complex karyotype, more aneuploidy state, more number of somatic mutations (median mutation rate 30/case vs 10/case, respectively). Regarding the clinical outcome, as previously reported (Grossmann V. et Al. Blood 2013), alterations of TP53 were significantly associated with poor outcome in terms of both overall survival (median survival: 4 and 31 months in TP53 mutated and wild type patients, respectively; p<0.0001) and relapse free-survival (RFS) (p < 0.0001). (Figure 1) Figure 1: Overall Survival curve of 172 AML patients with (red) or without (blue) TP53 mutations (p< 0.0001). Conclusions : Our data demonstrated that TP53 mutations are more frequent at diagnosis in the subgroup of complex karyotype AML (16.86%) (p< 0.0001\u2013Fisher's exact test). They are mostly deleterious mutations and are significantly correlated with worst prognosis, fail to respond to therapy and rapidly progress. We recommend TP53 mutation screening at least in AML pts carrying either complex karyotype or chr. 8 gain. Supported by : ELN, AIL, AIRC, PRIN, progetto Regione-Universit\u02c6 2010-12 (L.
