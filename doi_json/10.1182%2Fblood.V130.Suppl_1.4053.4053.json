    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) is an indolent B-cell malignancy which comprises approximately 10% of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Copanlisib is an intravenously administered pan-Class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor with predominant activity against PI3K-\u03b1 and PI3K-\u03b4 isoforms. In the recent phase II CHRONOS-1 trial, treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell lymphoma with copanlisib resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of 59%. A total of 23 patients (16%) in the trial had MZL histology. We describe here a subset analysis of the MZL patients in CHRONOS-1 . Methods: Patients enrolled into the CHRONOS-1 trial with MZL had to have relapsed after, or were refractory to \u22652 prior lines of treatment. Previous treatment had to include rituximab and an alkylating agent. Copanlisib was administered at a fixed dose of 60 mg via 1-hour I.V. infusion on an intermittent schedule days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Treatment continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The subset analysis comprised 23 MZL patients (15 nodal, 4 splenic and 4 MALT lymphomas). Objective tumor response rate (ORR) after \u22654 cycles was assessed per independent radiologic review (Cheson et al., JCO 20:579, 2007). Secondary efficacy endpoints included duration of response (DOR). Adverse events were assessed using the CTCAE (v4.03) coding. Results: The 23 MZL patients, as assessed by the investigator, included 4 (17.4%) mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, 15 (65.2%) nodal MZL and 4 (17.4%) splenic MZL. Median age was 69 years (range 39-81) and ECOG status 0 and 1 roughly similar (52% and 48%). Prior treatment included a median of 3 (range 2-9) lines of therapy, with 48% being refractory to the last regimen, and 44% refractory to last rituximab regimen. As of the data cutoff date of 20 February, 2017, patients had received a median of 5.8 cycles of treatment with a median duration of treatment of 23 weeks (range 1-138). A total of 16 patients had an objective tumor response, for an ORR of 70%. Complete responses (CR) were observed in 3 (13%) patients, all with splenic MZL. Twelve of 15 (80%) patients with nodal disease had an objective tumor response and 1 of 4 (25%) with MALT had a response. The median DOR had not been reached, with the range being 1-728 days and 85% estimated to be in response at 9 months. Individual plots of tumor shrinkage over time for responders indicated rapid and prolonged responses (See Figure). The most common treatment-emergent AEs (all grade/grade 3+) for the entire CHRONOS-1 study population were transient hyperglycemia (50.7%/41.5%) and hypertension (30.3%/23.9%). Other AEs included decreased neutrophil count (31.7%/25.4%), diarrhea (33.8%/5.6%), lung infection (24.6%/16%), pneumonitis (7%/2.1%), and colitis (0.7%/0.7%). Laboratory toxicities of interest were principally grade-1, including elevated ALT (24.1% all-grade/20.6% grade-1) and AST (30.5% all grade/27% grade 1-2). In the MZL subset, there were no non-fatal opportunistic infections and no deaths attributed to copanlisib. However, there were 3 treatment-related deaths in the total patient population of the CHRONOS-1 study. Conclusions: Copanlisib treatment of relapsed or refractory MZL patients resulted in a promising ORR of 70% and CR rate of 13% in this cohort of 23 patients. Responses were durable, with the median DOR having not yet been reached (85% were estimated to be in response at 9 months), higher than what has been previously reported in the MZL treatment landscape, warranting further study of copanlisib in MZL.
