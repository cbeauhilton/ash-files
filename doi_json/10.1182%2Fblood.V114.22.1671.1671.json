    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1671 Poster Board I-697 Background Bevacizumab (Avastin), a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), is approved in combination with chemotherapy in lung, colorectal, breast and brain cancers. VEGF-A expression is reported in all lymphoma subtypes, with strongest expression in PTCL. Given the relatively poor prognosis of PTCL with standard therapy, we combined bevacizumab (A) with CHOP in the ECOG 2404 phase II trial. Methods Untreated PTCL pts with a normal baseline cardiac ejection fraction received bevacizumab 15 mg/ kg IV and CHOP chemotherapy on day 1 for 6-8 cycles. Patients (pts) with CR/PR/SD received maintenance therapy with bevacizumab 15 mg/ kg IV q 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Due to the reported 3.7% incidence of cardiac toxicity associated with bevacizumab in metastatic breast cancer pt previously exposed to anthracyclines (Avastin package insert), cardiac function was monitored prospectively with ejection fraction (EF) determination at the completion of A-CHOP prior to the start of bevacizumab maintenance. Results Among 33 pts who came off study, toxicity data are available for all and coded using CTCAE Version 3.0. 22 received at least 4 cycles of A-CHOP (median treatment duration 3.6 months (< 1-10.6 months). One or more designated cardiac toxicities were recorded for 5 of these 22 pts. Congestive heart failure (CHF), defined as grade 2-4 left ventricular dysfunction was recorded in 4 pt (18%, 90% CI 5.2%-40.3%): grade 4 (n=1), grade 3 (n=3). In 3 pts clinical CHF occurred after A-CHOP x 6 and in one during bevacizumab maintenance after A-CHOP x 8. The median time to development of a cardiac adverse event was 5 months (3.5 \u2013 8.8 months). One pt required a ventricular assist device in addition to medical management. In 3 of the 4 pts, ongoing medical management for CHF has been required. Other cardiac toxicities included ventricular arrhthymia (one grade 4, one grade 2), and one grade 2 cardiac troponin elevation. In addition, one patient experienced sudden death of uncertain cause. Three pts developed thromboses or embolic toxcities (two grade 4 and one grade 3). Conclusions We observed four cases of clinical CHF early after cumulative doxorubicin doses of 300-400 mg/m 2 in our study, The incidence of CHF among study patients who received 4 or more A-CHOP cycles is concerning and suggests that bevacizumab may potentiate the adverse cardiac effects of anthracyclines, resulting in clinically significant toxicity. Careful monitoring of cardiac function is warranted in ongoing trials combining bevacizumab and doxorubicin in lymphomas and solid tumors to assess long-term safety and better understand underlying mechanisms and risks.
