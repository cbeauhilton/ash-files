    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1346 Acquired resistance to the proteasome inhibitor (PI) bortezomib (BTZ) is an emerging factor limiting its efficacy in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. The clinical impact of acquired resistance has been shown in Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients who were re-treated with BTZ. Although BTZ-retreatment was found to be effective, the response rate as well as the duration of response were less as compared to initial treatment, indicating the development of BTZ-resistance in a subgroup of patients. In line with that, we previously found increased expression of constitutive proteasome (cP) subunit \u00df5 harbouring a mutation in the BTZ-binding pocket and a decreased expression of non-mutated immunoproteasome subunits in BTZ-resistant cell lines of hematologic malignancies (Franke and Niewerth et al, Leukemia 2012). We here explore whether upregulation of immunoproteasome (iP) expression could restore sensitivity in BTZ-resistant leukemia cells towards BTZ and two epxoyketone-based irreversible PIs; carfilzomib (CFZ) and the \u00df5i-targeted ONX 0914. BTZ-resistant cell lines were of multiple myeloma (8226), T-cell (CEM) and myelomonocytic (THP1) origin and displayed resistance towards cell growth inhibition in the presence of 7\u2013200 nM BTZ. Induction of iP in wild type (WT) and BTZ-resistant 8226, CCRF-CEM and THP1 cells was achieved by exposure to 100U/ml Interferon- \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) for 6\u201372 h. IFN-\u03b3 transiently increased (maximum between 24\u201348 hours) mRNA levels of \u03b25i, \u03b21i, and \u03b22i up to 8-fold, 30-fold and 4-fold, respectively. These findings were corroborated at the \u03b25i, \u03b21i and \u03b22i protein expression level using Western blot analysis. Following IFN-\u03b3 exposure, chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity increased up to 2.5-fold compared to unstimulated controls, trypsin-like activity increased up to 1.5-fold, whereas caspase-like activity was slightly decreased. Consistent with increased proteasome activity, there was also an increased expression of cell surface HLA Class I molecules. The impact of IFN-\u03b3 induced upregulation of iPs on the sensitivity to the PI BTZ, CFZ, and ONX 0914, defined by the decrease in IC 50 , is summarized in Table 1 . 8226/BTZ100 cells became 4-fold more sensitive towards BTZ after IFN-\u03b3 exposure, whereas THP1/BTZ200 and CEM/BTZ200 cells displayed nearly 2-fold increased sensitivity. For CFZ, a modest level of sensitization was observed in all cell lines with high level BTZ resistance. Interestingly, for the immunoproteasome inhibitor ONX 0914, IC 50 values were markedly decreased (7-fold for 8226/BTZ100 and 3-fold for THP1/BTZ200 and CEM/BTZ200 cells). Additionally, in 8226 cells with low levels of BTZ resistance (8226/BTZ7), IFN-\u03b3 restored parental cell sensitivity to ONX 0914. Restoration of PI sensitivity after IFN-\u03b3 exposure was further confirmed by activation of PARP cleavage and accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, pointing to restoration of BTZ activity under proteasome inhibition and consequent induction of apoptosis. Finally, to provide evidence that upregulation of \u03b25i and or \u03b21i by IFN-\u03b3 was responsible for the observed sensitization, siRNA downregulation of \u03b25i and \u03b21i was applied prior to exposure to IFN-\u03b3. Under these conditions, mRNA levels and proteasome activity of \u03b25i remained suppressed, even after exposure to IFN-\u03b3. Moreover, after \u03b25i silencing, PI sensitization and apoptosis were attenuated. Silencing of \u03b21i expression had no effect on PI-sensitization. In conclusion, down-regulation of \u03b25i subunit expression is a major determinant of BTZ-resistance and increasing its proteasomal assembly after IFN-\u03b3 exposure facilitates restoration of sensitivity in BTZ-resistant leukemia cells towards cP inhibitors and in particular iP inhibitors.
