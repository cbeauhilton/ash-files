    "abstract_text": "Staging of patients with myeloma currently takes into account the number of bone lesions identified with standard X-rays. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) appears to be a more sensitive imaging technique in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) but it is not adapted to the investigation of the entire skeleton. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging appears promising but this approach remains to be validated in patients with MM. Most patients with neoplasia have been performed with 18 F-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), a functional marker suggested to identify \u201cactive\u201d tumor sites and useful to assess bone or extra-osseous tissue. Conversely Na 18 F binding is strictly limited to bone. To determine the potential usefulness of these two markers we performed a comparative analysis of these two imaging techniques in patients with MM. Nine patients with progressive MM, including bone lesions, underwent x-ray imaging, MRI, 18 FDG and Na 18 F scanning. Both PET scans were performed within a one-week time frame in each patient. The number and localizations of suspect lesions identified by each type of imaging technique was assessed independently then compared. 18 FDG and Na 18 F data were compared to X-ray/MRI data for skull, spine, pelvis and femur/humerus localizations. Localizations were considered positive in case of increased fixation with 18 FDG or increased or decreased fixation with Na 18 F. Comparison of FDG data with X-ray/MRI showed that FDG allowed the detection of only 3 of 35 types of localizations identified by X-ray/MRI, whatever the localization (skull, femur/humerus, spine and pelvis) observed on X-ray/MRI. 18 FDG showed three lesions which had not been identified by X-ray/MRI, as well as 8 costal localizations and 1 extra-osseous localization. Comparison of Na 18 F data with X-ray/MRI showed that Na 18 F allowed the detection of 17 of 35 types of localizations. In particular, Na 18 F identified 13 of the 19 spinal localizations observed with x-ray/MRI but only 2 of 9 skull lesions. Na 18 F identified 11 localizations which had not been identified by X-ray/MRI. Furthermore Na18F also identified costal localizations in all patients. Qualitative analysis of PET scans showed that background was significantly lower with Na 18 F imaging than with 18 FDG imaging. In conclusion 18 FDG and Na 18 F provide significantly different results in patients with progressive MM. 18 FDG imaging was poorly correlated with X-rayMRI while Na 18 F imaging was particularly useful to identify costal and spinal lesions. PET scan could be a useful method in the staging of MM patients at diagnosis or to determine response.
