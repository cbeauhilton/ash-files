    "abstract_text": "Introduction African-American ethnicity, male sex, older age and obesity are accepted risk factors for multiple myeloma (MM). Obesity early in life is a risk factor for many cancers, including MM; most studies have focused on populations of European origin. African-Americans have a higher prevalence of obesity than other populations, and may have a distinct genetic contribution to this condition. We established a multi-center collaborative study to investigate possible explanations for the excess risk of MM among African-Americans. The aim of the present case-case analysis was to determine whether body mass index (BMI) was associated with risk factors and clinical characteristics at presentation in African-American MM patients. Methods Patients diagnosed with active MM since January 1, 2009 were recruited from nine outpatient centers and three Surveillance, Epidemiology, End-Results Program (SEER) population-based cancer registries. Information on weight and height at 20 years of age and at 5 years prior to diagnosis was obtained from questionnaires. Clinical information collected included age at diagnosis, stage, percent plasmacytosis on bone marrow biopsy, \u03b2 2 microglobulin level, Ig serotype, light vs. heavy chain disease, and presence of lytic bone lesions. BMI (ht/wt 2 ) was categorized into 3 levels (normal 30) according to World Health Organization standard. The Pearson chi-square test was used to test the association between BMI category, and risk factors and clinical characteristics. Mean ages at diagnosis across BMI categories were compared using linear regression and a t-test for trend calculated. Results To date, 1,044 African-American MM patients have been enrolled and of those, 1,014 provided a DNA sample. At present, 970 patients have completed a questionnaire, clinical records have been abstracted for 823 patients, and 509 patients have some information on gender, age at diagnosis, weight, height and clinical characteristics.The mean age at diagnosis was 59. Increasing BMI at age 20 was associated with younger age at diagnosis (p= 0.0004), whereas BMI at 5 years prior to diagnosis was not associated with age at diagnosis (p=0.9477). Among men, mean age at diagnosis decreased with increasing BMI at age 20 (p= 0.0125) ( Table 1a ) and at 5 years prior to diagnosis (p=0.0252) ( Table 1b ). Among women, the trend was signficant at age 20 (p=0.0018) ( Table 1a ) but not at 5 years prior to diagnosis (p= 0.7094) ( Table 1b ). Increasing BMI was not significantly associated with any other clinical characteristics.

A similar trend was observed in men only at 5 years prior to diagnosis, consistent with previous reports. Obesity is one of the few known potentially modifiable risk factors for MM. Younger age at diagnosis reflects an earlier accumulation of either or both genetic and environmental risk factors. Obesity at an early age may influence MM risk through shared biological pathways such as interleukin-6 and insulin-like growth factor, by contributing to chronic B-cell activation, thereby increasing susceptibilty for MM later in life. The significance of the gender difference for the association closer to diagnosis is unclear and requires additional study. Disclosures: Terebelo: Amgen: Honoraria; Millennium: Honoraria.
