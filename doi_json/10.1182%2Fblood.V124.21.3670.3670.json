    "abstract_text": "Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) comprises up to 10% of childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. However, no large-scale studies have comprehensively evaluated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with AMKL. We performed a large-scale international retrospective study of pediatric patients (diagnosed at age \u226418 years) with de novo AMKL without Down syndrome treated from 1989 to 2009. The study included 490 patients with AMKL, which comprises 7.9% of the pediatric AML patients treated by 19 members of the I-BFMSG. At diagnosis, the median age of patients was 1.5 years (range, 0.0\u201316.5 years), median white blood cell count was 12.0\u00d710 9 /L (range, 0.6\u2013188.0\u00d710 9 /L), 23 (4.7%) patients showed central nervous system involvement, and both sexes were equally represented. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 417 (85.1%) patients, and 5-year event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 43.7%\u00b12.7% and 49.0%\u00b12.7%, respectively. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) was performed in 206 (42.0%) patients. The 5-year disease-free survival and OS rates for patients who received allo-HSCT in first CR ( n =112, 56.3%\u00b15.2%, and 57.7%\u00b15.2%, respectively) and for those who did not receive transplantation in first CR ( n =298, 50.2%\u00b13.6% and 55.2%\u00b13.5%) were not significantly different ( P =0.12 and P =0.57). Complete cytogenetic data were available for 372 (75.9%) patients: diploid ( n =49, 13.2%), hypodiploid ( n =18, 4.8%), pseudodiploid ( n =119, 32.0%), 47\u201350 chromosomes ( n =142, 38.2%), and >50 chromosomes ( n =44, 11.8%). Chromosome gain occurred in 195 (52.4%) patients: +21 was the most common ( n =106, 28.5%), followed by +19 ( n =93, 25.0%), and +8 ( n =77, 20.7%). Losses occurred in 65 cases (17.5%), in the decreasing order of \u20137 ( n =13, 3.5%), \u20139 ( n =9, 2.4%), \u201313, and \u201315 ( n =7 each, 1.9%). Structural chromosomal aberrations were observed in 278 (74.7%) patients, most commonly t(1;22) ( n =51, 13.7%) and 11q23 rearrangements ( n =38, 10.2%) with t(9;11) in 21 patients. Other abnormalities included 7p ( n =43, 11.6%) and 13q ( n =31, 8.3%; 16 with deletions) breakpoints. Patients with t(1;22) were significantly younger at diagnosis ( P <0.001; median 0.6 years, range 0.0\u20136.3 years) and more often female ( P =0.05; 64.7%) while those with \u20137 were significantly older ( P =0.006; median 4.2 years, range 0.4\u201315.0 years) than those with other cytogenetic subgroups. Multiple regression analysis for EFS and OS with clinical and cytogenetic features showed that treatment period (1989\u20131999 vs. 2000\u20132009), normal cytogenetics, \u20137, t(9;11), 13q-, and \u201315 were associated with significantly worse outcomes than those for other subgroups, whereas abnormalities in 7p were associated with better outcomes (Table). Patients with \u201313 and 9p abnormalities other than t(9;11) had a poorer EFS and OS, respectively. Patients with +21 or t(1;22) did not show a significant difference in survival rates. This international study on the largest cohort of AMKL patients analyzed to date shows heterogeneity in cytogenetic findings and identifies some subgroups with a particularly dismal outcome. The advent of newer methods to evaluate genetic lesions can help identify therapeutic targets for improving the outcome in this subgroup of patients.
