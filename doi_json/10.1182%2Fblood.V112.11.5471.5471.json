    "abstract_text": "Background: Despite improvements achieving complete remission and progress in supportive care of children with acute leukemias or solid tumors during the last decade, there are no optimal prognostic markers in stratification of risk of adverse events leading to poor outcome. The endogenous nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor asymmetrical dimethyl-L-arginine (ADMA) is associated with atherosclerosis and represents an independent marker for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Aim: To investigate the clinical significance of methylarginines in leukemia and solid tumors in children. Material and method: Concentration of metabolites of nitric-oxide pathway in children during therapy of acute leukemia (ALL) \u2013 N 12 and solid tumors N 15 (osteosarcoma, RMS, PNET, Wilms\u2019 tumor) was determined. Correlations of biochemical markers, blood count parameters and plasma level of methylarginines were investigated. In addition, the influence of cytostatics on NO-pathway metabolites was analyzed. Results: Table 1: Differences in mean plasma concentration of arginine, ADMA and SDMA in pts with leukemia vs pts with solid tumor  . Leukemia N=12 Mean \u00b1SD . Median\u00b1SEM .

Treatment with glucocorticoids and cytarabine was associated with significantly lower level of L-Arg. No significant treatment dependent difference was found in level of nitric oxide metabolic pathway.",
