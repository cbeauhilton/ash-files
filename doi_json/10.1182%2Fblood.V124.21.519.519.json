    "abstract_text": "Background : Ponatinib is an approved potent oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor active against native and mutated forms of BCR-ABL, including T315I. The phase 2 PACE study demonstrated that ponatinib is highly active in heavily pretreated Philadelphia chromosome\u2012positive leukemia patients. Ponatinib efficacy and safety were evaluated in newly diagnosed CP-CML patients in the EPIC trial. Methods : EPIC was a multicenter, international, phase 3, randomized, 2-arm, open-label trial of ponatinib (45 mg once daily) compared with imatinib (400 mg once daily) in newly diagnosed CP-CML; patients were stratified by Sokal risk score (low [1.2]). On 18 October 2013,EPIC was terminated due to the observation of arterial thrombotic events in the ponatinib development program. Consequently, none of the prospectively defined endpoints could be analyzed. Data as of 1 April 2014 are presented for endpoints that could be analyzed: BCR-ABL IS <10% rate at 3 months; major molecular response (MMR), molecular response (MR)4, and MR4.5 rates at and after at least 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and at any time; time to response; complete cytogenetic response rates at 6 and 12 months and any time; and safety. Results : At the time of study termination, 307 patients had been randomized; median follow-up was 5.1 (0.03-17.6) months. Groups were well-balanced with respect to sex, age, pretreatment, and Sokal score; however, the proportion of patients with 1 or more cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, obesity and smoking) was higher in the ponatinib arm (n=97, 63%) compared to the imatinib arm (n=79, 52%). Data were available on 306 treated patients (154 ponatinib, 152 imatinib). Fourteen ponatinib and 2 imatinib patients discontinued due to adverse events (AEs). Molecular response rates for ponatinib were uniformly higher compared with imatinib for all response measures and at all time points ( Table ). The percentage of patients who achieved <10% BCR-ABL at 3 months was significantly higher in the ponatinib compared with imatinib arm overall (Table), and when patients were stratified by high-risk, intermediate-risk, and low-risk Sokal score (Figure). The percentage of patients who achieved MMR, MR4, and MR4.5 at any time in all Sokal risk groups was higher for ponatinib than imatinib ( Figure ). The most common (\u226525%) all-grade treatment-emergent AEs with ponatinib were rash (38%), abdominal pain (36%), headache (33%), constipation (27%), increased lipase (27%), myalgia (26%), and thrombocytopenia (25%); with imatinib, they were nausea (34%), muscle spasms (34%), and diarrhea (27%). Twelve percent of ponatinib and 7% of imatinib patients had grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia; 3% of ponatinib and 8% of imatinib patients had grade 3/4 neutropenia. Serious treatment-emergent AEs (SAEs) occurring in \u22653 ponatinib patients were pancreatitis (n=5), atrial fibrillation (n=3), and thrombocytopenia (n=3); no individual SAEs occurred in \u22653 imatinib patients. Eleven (7%) ponatinib and 3 (2%) imatinib patients experienced arterial thrombotic events, designated serious for 10 [7%] ponatinib and 1 [0.7%] imatinib patient(s). One patient in the ponatinib arm experienced a serious venous thromboembolic event: there were none in the imatinib arm. Ten of 11 ponatinib patients, and 2 of 3 imatinib patients with arterial thrombotic events had 1 or more cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusions : Despite early termination, at a median follow-up of 5 months, preliminary evidence suggests that ponatinib has improved efficacy over imatinib in newly diagnosed CP-CML patients, but has a higher AE rate, including ATEs at the dose studied. Future investigations of ponatinib in the frontline setting will likely use lower doses and account for relevant risk factors. Abstract 519.
