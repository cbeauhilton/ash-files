    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1577 Hematopoiesis is a tightly regulated biological process that relies upon complicated interactions between the blood cells and their microenvironment. Adhesion molecules like P-selectin are essential to hematopoiesis, and their dysregulation has been implicated in leukemogenesis. We have previously shown a role for P-selectin in chronic myeloid leukemia and demonstrated that in its absence the disease process accelerates. Recently, there has also been speculation that P-selectin may play a role in the aging hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), as its expression in upregulated as a mouse ages. In this study, we show that the loss of P-selectin function dysregulates the balance of stem cells and progenitors and that these differences become more pronounced with age. We compared the percentages of HSCs, long-term (LT)-HSCs, short-term (ST)-HSCs, multipotent progenitors (MPPs), CMPs, GMPs and MEPs in bone marrow by flow cytometry between wild type (WT) and Selp -/- mice. An age-dependent LT-HSC expansion was observed in WT mice. However, this expansion was prevented by the loss of Selp as observed in Selp -/- mice. Further, we demonstrate that with age LT-HSCs in particular express more elevated levels of P-selectin. LT-HSCs and ST-HSC/MPPs were isolated from the bone marrow of young (2 months old) and old (15 months old) WT mice and examined P-selectin expression by FACS. A significant increase in P-selectin expression was observed in LT-HSCs of old mice, and this increase was not observed in the ST-HSC+MPP subpopulations. We also show that the loss of P-selectin gene has profound effects of stem cell function, altering the capacity of these cells to home. Despite impaired homing capacity, stem cells lacking P-selectin possess a competitive advantage over their wild type counterparts. Using a stem cell competition assay, HSCs derived from Selp -/- mice (CD45.2 + ) and WT control mice (CD45.2 + GFP + ) were mixed in 1:1 ratio and transplanted into irradiated WT recipients (CD45.1). The initial findings were potentially indicative of the ability of cells derived from GFP mice to more efficiently home and engraft. Despite this initial advantage, cells derived from Selp -/- eventually exhibited a competitive and statistically significant advantage over the cells derived from GFP mice. At 30 days post-transplant, 49.9\u00b11.4% of the CD45.2 subpopulation was GFP + . At 86 days post-transplant, 25.7\u00b13.3 % of the CD45.2 cells derived from the peripheral blood were GFP + . Similarly, 23.0\u00b13.7% of the CD45.2 cells derived from the bone marrow of these mice were GFP + . Indeed, we demonstrate that recipients of P-selectin deficient bone marrow cells more efficiently repopulate the bone marrow than controls and that this advantage extends and expands in the long-term. Finally, we demonstrate that recipients of leukemic cells lacking P-selectin develop a more accelerated form of leukemia accompanied by significant increases in stem and progenitor cells. Bone marrow cells from donor WT and Selp -/- mice were infected with retrovirus expressing BCR-ABL-GFP, and irradiated WT recipients were transplanted with 2\u00d710 5 of these transduced donor cells. At 14 days post-transplant, recipient mice from each of the groups were sacrificed, and bone marrow cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. Recipients of leukemic Selp -/- cells possessed 3.5-fold more LSCs than recipients of wild-type cells. There were 3.1-fold more LT-LSCs and 3.8-fold more ST-LSCs and MPPs in recipients of Selp -/- cells than WT cells. In addition, recipients of leukemic Selp -/- cells possessed significantly more CMP (16.9-fold) and MEP (4.5-fold) cells. Because P-selectin expression increases with age on LT-HSCs, we sought to determine the role that age plays in CML development and progression. Bone marrow cells derived from 15-month-old donor Selp -/- and WT mice were transduced with BCR-ABL, respectively, followed by transplantation of the transduced cells into recipient mice. All recipients of BCR-ABL transduced Selp -/- cells died by 23 days after induction of CML and had a median survival of 19 days, whereas recipients of the transduced WT cells survived significantly longer. This pro-leukemic role for cells lacking P-selectin expression is leukemic stem cell-specific rather than stromal cell-specific and supports an essential role for P-selectin on leukemic stem cells.
