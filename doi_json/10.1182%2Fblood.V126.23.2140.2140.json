    "abstract_text": "Background: Mechanisms of hereditary erythrocytosis have been elucidated recently. These include high oxygen affinity (HOA) hemoglobin (Hb) variants, bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) deficiency, abnormalities in the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) and oxygen-sensing pathway (OSP) proteins prolyl hydroxylase domain-2 (PHD2), hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha subunit (HIF2A), and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL). We present our experience with these disorders. Methods: Evaluation of erythrocytosis patients' blood samples for HOA Hb variants by protein or DNA sequencing methods has been performed in our laboratory for over 30 years. Testing has included alkaline/acid electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, capillary electrophoresis, high performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and Sanger sequencing. BPGM deficiency was determined by enzyme activity assay and/or genetic testing. Since 2012 we have evaluated the EPOR, EGLN1 (PHD2), EPAS1(HIF2A) , and VHL genes. Reflexive evaluations, which include testing for p50 and pertinent Sanger sequencing of HBB , HBA1 , HBA2 , EPOR (exon 8), EGLN1 (exons 1-5), EPAS1 (exon 12) and VHL, have been performed on a subset of cases. Genetic results were correlated with clinical and phenotypic data. Results: Retrospective database review identified 62 confirmed HOA Hb variants (48\u03b2, 14\u03b1) with clinical erythrocytosis (Table 1). Multiple Hb variants were silent on at least one protein method but showed decreased p50 values. One homozygous BPGM mutation case was identified. Of the 394 cases evaluated for EPOR and OSP abnormalities, 39 cases (10%) contained genetic alterations. Of these, 11 were known pathogenic mutations and 28 were novel alterations including 4 pathogenic, 12 likely pathogenic and 12 variants of unknown significance (VUS). Eighteen EGLN1 , 10 EPAS1 , and 7 EPOR alterations were detected, all heterozygous. Four VHL mutation cases were identified: 3 homozygous/compound heterozygous known mutations and one novel heterozygous VUS (p.R200Q). All EPOR mutations resulted in a premature stop codon. Most of the EPAS1 alterations were located near proline 531, although two predicted splice site disturbances were found. The EGLN1 alterations were novel, variable, and affect the enzyme's catalytic domain. All 4 VHL cases involved the R200 amino acid position in at least one allele. Serum Epo levels varied: decreased in EPOR (5/5); normal in PHD2 (11/11) and most HIF2A (6/7) and VHL (3/4) cases; increased in 1 HIF2A and 1 VHL case. p50 was normal in EPOR and OSP cases (31/31 tested). Conclusion: A spectrum of abnormalities was identified. Salient points include: 1) Diagnostically, a high index of suspicion for HOA Hb variants is required as they can give false negative results by routine protein detection methods. p50 and Epo levels were useful for triage. 2) Phenotypically, serum Epo levels were low in EPOR and normal in PHD2 and HIF2A cases. Unexpectedly, the two classic Chuvash polycythemia VHL cases were associated with normal Epo levels. 3) Mechanistically, the alterations were truncating in EPOR , variable and scattered in EGLN1 and clustered near proline 531 in EPAS1 . VHL mutations were rare and consistently affected the R200 amino acid position in at least one allele. Novel alterations were frequent, especially in EGLN1 . 4) Clinically, many patients were asymptomatic but a subset demonstrated recurrent headaches and one had chest pain. Clotting complications included cerebrovascular accident in one EPAS1 and EGLN1 case each and portal vein thrombosis in one EGLN1 case. Table 1.
