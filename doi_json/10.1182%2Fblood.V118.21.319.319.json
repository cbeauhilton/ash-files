    "abstract_text": "Abstract 319 Between 1996 and 1999, 172 patients (median age, 42; range, 12\u201355 years) with hematologic malignancies were randomly assigned to receive either bone marrow (BM) or G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) from HLA-identical siblings after myeloablative conditioning. Early results of this 3-institution study ( Bensinger et al., NEJM; Vol. 344, No .3, 2001 ) showed that the use of PBSC, compared with BM, was associated with significantly superior rates of 2-year overall and disease-free survival. To assess the long-term impact of evolving chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) on outcomes, we analyzed follow-up data from all participating patients. Our follow-up analysis showed sustained protection against recurrent malignancy associated with the use of PBSC compared with BM ( Figure 1 ). The estimated 10-year probability of relapse was 20% with PBSC and 32% with BM (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for BM versus PBSC, 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2\u20134.1; p=0.01). In contrast to the earlier analysis, the hazard of overall mortality for all patients was not significantly different between the two groups. However, there was a trend toward superior overall survival associated with use of PBSC, which was attributable to increased mortality with use of BM in the subgroup of patients with high-risk cancers (n=80; HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.8\u20132.5; p=0.21). The 2-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD requiring systemic immunosuppressive treatment was 48% with PBSC and 37% with BM (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.5\u20131.4; p=0.55). We found no evidence that the use of PBSC prolonged the duration of systemic immunosuppressive treatment among patients with chronic GVHD (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.6\u20132.6; p=0.64). In conclusion, among patients who had hematologic malignancies treated with myeloablative conditioning and hematopoietic cell transplantation from HLA-identical sibling donors, the use of PBSC conferred greater long-term protection against recurrent malignancy than BM without causing excess chronic GVHD-related mortality.
