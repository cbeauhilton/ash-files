    "abstract_text": "Transforming growth factor beta is an important regulator of hematopoiesis and its overactivation has been shown to occur in myelodysplastic syndromes. Even though TGF-beta leads to activation of the transcription factor SMAD2, the exact gene expression program and chromatin changes stimulated in human hematopoiesis are not well studied. We generated primary erythroid progenitors from human CD34 + stem cells and assessed genome occupancy of SMAD2 upon TGF-beta stimulation by Chip-seq analysis. We observed widespread occupancy of important stem cell and differentiation regulators with approximately 7000 binding regions. Parallel RNA-seq identified gene expression changes that are associated with smad2 binding at respective promoters and enhancers. Genes involved in stem cell maintenance as well as erythroid differentiation were prominently altered by TGF-beta and contained prominent SMAD2 peaks in hematopoietic progenitors. Next, to determine the relative contribution of various TGF-beta ligands in bone marrow failure, we analyzed a large cohort of MDS serum samples and found TGF-beta 1 (TGF-b1) to be the predominantly elevated ligand in 30% samples. Exposure to MDS patient serum led to erythroid differentiation blocks in primary hematopoietic stem cells in clonogenic cultures. Finally, we analyzed the effect of constitutive secretion of TGF-b1 in a transgenic mouse containing TGF-b1 gene driven by an albumin promoter. These mice constitutively secrete TGF-b1 and become cytopenic and show marrow histological changes that mimic human MDS. We observed stem cell expansion and block at the stage of common myeloid progenitor (CMP) in these mice; findings that are similar to stem and progenitors alterations seen in human MDS patients. To inhibit TGF-b1 signaling we next used a novel ALK5 (TGF-beta receptor I kinase) inhibitor that has been shown to be safe for human use. Vactosertib is specific small molecule inhibitor of ALK5 with a IC50 between 1 x 10 -8 M and 1 x 10 -9 M and has been shown to have an acceptable safety profile in phase I trial in solid tumors (NCT02160106). Vactosertib was able to inhibit smad2 phosphorylation and activation in a variety of hematopoietic cell lines. Vactosertib treatment led to reversal of hematopoietic alterations upon exposure to MDS serum in clonogenic assays. Vactosertib dosing in vivo also led to increased blood counts in TGF/alb transgenic mice and resulted in normalization of stem and progenitor changes. In conclusion, we demonstrate increased TGF-b1 levels in subset of MDS samples. We also determined TGF-b1 stimulated smad2 binding in important regulatory regions of the genome in primary human erythroid progenitors. We also demonstrate the preclinical efficacy of novel TGF-beta receptor 1 kinase inhibitor in vitro and in vivo . These studies provide preclinical rationale for using this ALK5 inhibitor in trials.
