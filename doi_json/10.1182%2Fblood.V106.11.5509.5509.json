    "abstract_text": "Multiple prognostic models for patients with advanced Hodgkin\u2019s disease have been developed in an effort to identify high-risk individuals for ASCT and predict outcomes of high dose therapy and transplant. The utility of four of these models was examined in a cohort of patients transplanted in our program between 1993 and 2005. A total of 113 patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin\u2019s disease received ASCT. Forty-five patients received a conditioning regimen of busulfan, melphalan, and thiotepa (BuMelTT) whereas 68 patients received other standard conditioning regimens (SCR) including Cy/TBI/VP (23), CBV (39), and other (6). Median age is 34.5 years for BuMelTT and 34.0 years for SCR patients. Ninety-eight percent of patients receiving BuMelTT had at least two or more prior regimens compared with 86% SCR patients. Eighty-seven percent of BuMelTT and 93% of SCR patients had chemosensitive disease prior to transplant. Median followup is 113 weeks for BuMelTT patients versus 201 weeks for SCR patients. To date 37% of the BuMelTT and 56% of SCR patients have relapsed (p2 prior regimens, relapse in previous radiation field, extranodal disease) was predictive for OS for the entire group (p<0.01) and for the BuMelTT (p=0.05) and SCR (p<0.01) cohorts. The SWOG model was also able to differentiate EFS between good and poor risk patients for the entire group (p=0.02) and SCR group (p=0.05) but not for the BuMelTT cohort. None of the models could differentiate between good and poor risk patients with regard to RFS. When good and poor risk were defined as 0 factors versus 1 to 3 factors, the RPCI model (chemotherapy-resistant disease, poor performance status, and 3 or more chemotherapy regimens prior to transplant) was predictive of OS (p=0.02) and EFS (p=0.02) but only for the BuMelTT cohort. These results suggest that BuMelTT may improve long-term outcomes in patients with advanced Hodgkin\u2019s disease. The prognostic models evaluated had limited utility in our patient cohort with only the SWOG model being predictive of outcome. Large multi-institutional studies are needed to improve prognostic models for transplantation in advanced Hodgkin\u2019s disease.",
