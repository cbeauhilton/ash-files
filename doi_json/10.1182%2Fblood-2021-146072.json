    "abstract_text": "Introduction: There are several treatment options for patients (pts) with progressive multiple myeloma (MM) who are refractory to lenalidomide but most pts relapse shortly after receiving salvage treatment. Cilta-cel is a CAR-T therapy expressing 2 BCMA-targeting, single-domain antibodies that demonstrated early, deep, and durable responses in pts with MM who had received \u22653 prior lines of therapy (LOT) in the phase 1b/2 CARTITUDE-1 study (Berdeja, Lancet, 2021). The multicohort, open-label, phase 2 CARTITUDE-2 study (NCT04133636) is evaluating cilta-cel safety and efficacy in various clinical settings for pts with MM and exploring suitability of outpatient administration. Initial analysis (median follow-up 5.8 mo) of pts in CARTITUDE-2 cohort A (lenalidomide-refractory with 1-3 prior LOT) demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 95%, with 75% of pts achieving complete response or better (\u2265CR) and 85% achieving very good partial response or better (\u2265VGPR). Here, we present updated results for this population. Methods: Pts had progressive MM after 1-3 prior LOT, including a PI and immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), were lenalidomide-refractory, and had no prior exposure to BCMA-targeting agents. Bridging therapy was allowed after apheresis. A single cilta-cel infusion (target dose 0.75\u00d710 6 CAR+ viable T cells/kg) was given 5-7 d after start of lymphodepletion (daily cyclophosphamide [300 mg/m 2 ] and fludarabine [30 mg/m 2 ] for 3 d). The primary endpoint was minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity at 10 -5 . Secondary endpoints were ORR, duration of response (DOR), time and duration of MRD negativity, and incidence and severity of AEs. MRD was assessed by next-generation sequencing, response was assessed per IMWG criteria, and adverse events (AEs) were graded using CTCAEv5.0 (CRS and ICANS by ASTCT). Results: Initial results from this cohort were published at ASCO 2021 . Here we report data as of the April 15, 2021, data cutoff (median follow-up 9.7 mo: range 3.3-13.4) . 20 pts (65% male; median age 60 years [range 38-75]) received cilta-cel; 1 pt was treated in an outpatient setting. Pts received a median of 2 prior LOT (range 1-3); 60% received 1 or 2 prior LOT and 40% received 3 prior LOT. All pts were exposed to a PI, IMiD, and dexamethasone, 95% to alkylating agents, and 65% to daratumumab. In all, 95% of pts were refractory to the last LOT; 40% were triple-class refractory. ORR was 95% (95% CI 75.1-99.9); 85% (95% CI 62.1-96.8) of pts had \u2265CR, and 95% (95% CI 75.1-99.9) had \u2265VGPR (Figure). Median time to first response was 1.0 mo (range 0.7-3.3); median time to best response was 3.3 mo (range 0.9-7.9); median time to \u2265CR was 2.6 mo (range 0.9-7.9). Median DOR was not reached; 6-mo PFS rate was 90% (95% CI 65.6-97.4). Of MRD-evaluable pts (n=13), 92.3% (95% CI 64.0-99.8) were MRD-negative at 10 -5 . Hematologic AEs in \u226520% of pts were neutropenia (95%; grade [gr] 3/4: 95%), thrombocytopenia (80%; gr 3/4: 35%), anemia (75%; gr 3/4: 45%), lymphopenia (65%; gr 3/4: 60%) and leukopenia (55%; gr 3/4: 55%). CRS occurred in 95% of pts (gr 3/4: 10%). Median time to CRS onset was 7 d (range 5-9), with a median duration of 4 d (range 2-11). CRS resolved within 7 d in 90% of pts. CAR T-cell neurotoxicity occurred in 4 pts (20%; all gr 1/2). Three pts (15%) had ICANS (all gr 1/2); median time to onset was 8 d (range 7-10) and median duration was 3 d (range 1-3). One pt had other neurotoxicities (gr 2 facial paralysis); time to onset was 29 d with a duration of 51 d. No movement and neurocognitive TEAEs were observed. One death occurred due to COVID-19 (assessed as treatment-related by the investigator). Safety profile was manageable in the pt treated in an outpatient setting. Conclusions: At a longer median follow-up of 9.7 mo, a single cilta-cel infusion led to early and deep responses in pts with MM who had 1-3 prior LOT and were lenalidomide-refractory. ORR in this cohort was consistent with the CARTITUDE-1 study in heavily pretreated pts; responses deepened over time, with 92% of MRD-evaluable pts achieving MRD 10 -5 negativity. The safety profile was manageable; CRS was mostly gr 1/2, and no movement and neurocognitive TEAEs occurred, suggesting the efficacy of monitoring and pt management strategies that were implemented across phase 2/3 studies in the CARTITUDE program. Follow-up is ongoing, including additional enrollment in this cohort; this pt population is being further evaluated in the CARTITUDE-4 study (NCT04181827).
