    "abstract_text": "Chimerism analysis after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is of major importance to monitor engraftment, graft rejection and disease relapse. Besides the routine application of short tandem repeat (STR)-based methods, XY-FISH comprises a well established method in sex-mismatched transplantation. While the sensitivity levels of these methods are sufficient for monitoring engraftment, a higher sensitivity seems desirable for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD). In this context highly sensitive quantitative Real-Time PCR (RQ-PCR) assays appear to be of great utility, among them a Real-Time quantitative Y chromosome-specific PCR (QYCS-PCR). QYCS-PCR allows chimerism analysis in male patients with female donors, accounting for about 25% of all transplantations. Here we have evaluated the clinical utility of this method compared to the routine methods of STR-PCR and XY-FISH in 36 samples of BM or PB derived from 11 patients at various time points after myeloablative (n=3) and nonmyeloablative (n=8) allogeneic PBSCT. Patients were transplanted for MM (5), AML (3), ALL (2) and NHL (1). Follow-up time ranged from 138 days to 1776 days post PBSCT. The majority of patients (n=8) showed a complete remission, whereas three patients experienced a relapse after PBSCT. Routine STR-analysis was performed applying 4 highly polymorphic markers in a multiplex PCR on an A.L.F. sequencer (sensitivity 5%). In the standardized XY-FISH analysis 200 nuclei were evaluated (sensitivity 1%). RQ-PCR was performed on a Rotor-Gene 3000 cycler. Serial dilutions of male mononuclear blood cells in female cells (100%, 50%, 25%, 10%, 1%, 0,1% and 0,01%) were prepared. The DFFRY gene and the HCK gene (control) were amplified in a duplex Real Time PCR (sensitivity 0,01%). Results of STR-analysis ranged from 40% to 100% donor chimerism. In the lower range of donor chimerism STR-PCR and XY-FISH showed a good correlation and a higher reproducibility than QYCS-PCR. In the majority of samples with complete chimerism in STR-PCR (n=20), compared to 13 samples with complete chimerism in XY-FISH, QYCS-PCR was able to detect residual host cells in 19 samples. Patients in complete remission showed a stable low level of persisting host cells (0,01-0,1%). In one patient with complete donor chimerism in STR-PCR and XY-FISH, QYCS-PCR was able to detect a rising level of host cells before clinical apparent relapse. Thus our data indicate that real-time quantitative Y chromosome-specific PCR based on the DFFRY gene allows highly sensitive and reliable detection of MRD in patients after sex-mismatched allogeneic transplantation. QYCS-PCR seems to be a valuable complementary tool complementing STR-PCR and XY-FISH. In some patients with complete donor chimerism in STR-PCR and XY-FISH analysis, it might allow earlier diagnosis of imminent relapse and offer more time for therapeutic intervention."
