    "abstract_text": "Background: Pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with the t(5;14) translocation occurs in less than 1% of B-ALL diagnoses. This translocation links the IGH on chromosome 14 with IL-3, which results in hypereosinophilia. Interestingly, circulating blasts or cytopenias usually don't accompany the eosinophilia. Patients often present with symptoms related to the eosinophilia, which can be quite morbid, and can delay the diagnosis of ALL. Few pediatric patients with this association have been described in the literature. The presentation and outcome can be quite variable, although it is thought that the prognosis in those patients is worse than standard ALL. Objectives: To review the laboratory and clinical features of pediatric ALL with t(5;14). Methods: Cases of pediatric patients with ALL and t(5;14) diagnosed at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario between 1995 and 2003 were reviewed. Results: We present two 11 year old children, a female and a male, who were diagnosed with B-ALL with t(5;14). The first one presented with a persisting low-grade fever and weight loss as well as asymptomatic lung infiltrates on the chest xray. The second patient presented with chest pain, fever, abdominal pain, as well as a petechial rash and splinter hemorrhages. His EKG showed ST depression, his troponins were elevated and an echocardiogram showed heart dysfunction. He went on and developed behavior changes and cerebral microinfarcts. Common to their presentation was the presence of hyperoesinophilia and absence of circulating blasts. Both had aggressive disease with persistent positive minimal residual disease (MRD) after consolidation and reinduction, which sent them to stem cell transplant. Conclusion: ALL with t(5;14) is a rare entity that usually presents with hypereosinophilia. While eosinophilia can be asymptomatic, it can also be the cause of important morbidity. Diagnosis can be delayed because of the absence of blasts in the peripheral blood and lack of severe cytopenia. Finally, due to its rarity, there is very little information available on how this cytogenic abnormality impacts prognosis, which seems to be worse than ALL without this translocation.
