Repetitive testing of von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels is necessary before the diagnosis can be safely ruled out, as VWF levels fluctuate in response to genetic and environmental factors. A predictive bleeding score (BS) could reveal individuals that may benefit from repetitive testing and those for whom repetitive testing is unlikely to be of benefit. While a standardized questionnaire (the Vicenza score) was developed to evaluate hemorrhagic symptoms, it was never prospectively validated for a pediatric population in a tertiary care setting. SUBJECTS The study targeted children, ages 0 to 17 years, referred to the Hemostasis and Thrombosis Center (HTC) of Nationwide Children's Hospital for a coagulation evaluation as a result of bleeding symptoms, family history of a bleeding disorder and/or abnormal coagulation labs found during pre-operative screening. Children were excluded if they had a previously diagnosed bleeding disorder, if their caregiver did not speak English or if the child did not undergo VWF:Ag and VWF:RCo testing. METHODS Prior to the diagnosis or exclusion of a bleeding disorder in the child, caregivers consented to answer the questionnaire over the telephone. Descriptions of the Vicenza score are available online ( http://www.euvwd.group.shef.ac.uk/bleed_score.htm ). LABORATORY TESTING A single VWF:Ag or VWF:RCo <30 IU/dL was classified as \u201cDefinite Type 1 VWD\u201d while levels from 30-50 IU/dL were classified as \u201cLow VWF\u201d ( http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/vwd ). Platelet function analysis (PFA-100) screened for platelet function defects, with some patients undergoing follow-up platelet aggregation studies and/or platelet electron microscopy. Laboratory studies from other institutions were excluded from analysis. Patients' medical records were reviewed after hematologic evaluation, and the resultant data was analyzed with STATA 10.1 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX). RESULTS A total of 104 children (52 females and 52 males) with a mean age of 7.53 years (range 1 month to 17 years) were included. At least one hemorrhagic symptom was present in 99 of the 104 children (95%) with the mean number of symptoms being 2.87 (range 0 to 7). The mean Vicenza score was 3.24 (range -1 to 13). Of the 104 children, 8 met criteria for \u201cDefinite Type 1 VWD,\u201d 23 met criteria for \u201cLow VWF,\u201d 14 were diagnosed with a \u201cPlatelet Function Defect,\u201d and 2 children had bleeding secondary to Ehlers Danlos syndrome. Children with non-bleeding disorders (e.g. Factor XII deficiency) or no laboratory evidence of a bleeding disorder were classified as \u201cNo Bleeding Disorder.\u201d In general, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and positive diagnostic likelihood ratio of the bleeding questionnaire demonstrated poor predictive value in our patient population with the exception of high specificity in ruling out \u201cDefinite Type 1 VWD\u201d (Table). The NPV was comparably high with both qualitative (>2 bleeding symptoms) and quantitative (BS \u22652) criteria. CONCLUSIONS The Vicenza score, previously validated in adults and in a pediatric primary care setting, appears to have limited predictive value in a pediatric tertiary care setting when evaluating patients with platelet function defects or low VWF levels. While the Vicenza score has a high NPV to exclude \u201cDefinite Type 1 VWD,\u201d the use of simpler qualitative criteria is similarly predictive.
