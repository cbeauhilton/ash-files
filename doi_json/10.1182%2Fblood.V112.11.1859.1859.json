    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Homozygozity for the p.Cys282Tyr (C282Y) mutation of the HFE gene is the main genotype associated with the common form of adult hereditary hemochromatosis. C282Y carriers do not usually develop iron overload, unless they have additional risk factors such as liver diseases, a dysmetabolic syndrome or an associated genetic defect. The commonest is the compound heterozygous state for C282Y and the widespread p.His63Asp (H63D) variant allele. However, a few rare HFE mutations can be found on the 6 th chromosome in trans, some of which are of clinical interest to fully understand the disorder. Patients and Methods: We recently investigated four C282Y carrier patients with unusually high iron parameters, including increased levels of serum ferritin (SF), high transferrin saturation (TS) and high iron liver content measured by MRI. They were males, aged 37, 40, 42, 47 at diagnosis. Two brothers (aged 40 and 42) were referred separately. The HFE genotype, including the determination of the C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations was performed using PCR-RFLP. HFE sequencing was undertaken using the previously described SCA method ( 1 ). Sequencing of other genes (namely, HAMP, HJV/HFE2, SLC40A1, TFR2 ) was possibly performed in a last step using the same method. Results: We identified three rare HFE mutant alleles, two of which are undescribed, in the four studied patients. One patient bore a 13 nucleotide-deletion in exon 6 (c.[1022_1034del13], p.His341_Ala345>LeufsX119), which is predicted to lead to an abnormal, elongated protein. The two brothers had a substitution of the last nucleotide of exon 2 (c.[340G>A], p.Glu114Lys) that may modify the splicing of the 2d intron. The third patient, who bore an insertion of a A in exon 4 (c.[794dupA],p.[trp267LeufsX80]), has already been reported ( 1 ). Discussion: A vast majority of C282Y carriers will not develop iron overload and can be reassured. However, a careful step by step strategy at the clinical and genetic levels may allow to correctly identify those patients deserving further investigation. First, clinical examination and the assessment of iron parameters (SF and TS) allow identifying C282Y heterozygotes with an abnormal iron status. Once extrinsic factors such as heavy alcohol intake, virus or a dysmetabolic syndrome have been excluded, MRI is very useful to authenticate a high liver iron content. Second, HFE genotype must first exclude the presence of the H63D mutation. Compound heterozygozity for C282Y and H63D, a very widespread condition in our area, is usually associated with mild iron overload. Third, HFE sequencing can be undertaken and may identify new HFE variants as described here. The two novel mutations, a frameshift modifying the composition and the length of the C terminal end of the HFE protein and a substitution located at the last base of an exon, are likely to lead to an impaired function of HFE in association with the C282Y mutant. However, it is noteworthy that three of the four patients were diagnosed relatively late, after the 4 th decade, as it is the case for C282Y homozygotes. Three further unrelated patients are currently under investigation in our laboratory for a similar clinical presentation. Finally, it can be noted that in those patients who will not have a HFE gene mutant identified, analysis of other genes implicated in iron overload must be performed to search for digenism or multigenism. None of our investigated patients had an additional gene abnormality.",
