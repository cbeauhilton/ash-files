    "abstract_text": "LIM domain only protein 2 (LMO2) is a regulator of hematopoiesis and an oncogene that is overexpressed in a subset of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Overexpression of LMO2 in T-ALL is associated with a poor prognosis. The mechanisms that regulate LMO2 expression in T-ALL are still unknown. Here, we present evidence that expression of LMO2 in T-ALL is regulated at the transcriptional level by Ikaros, a tumor suppressor protein whose deletion is associated with the development T-ALL. Global chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) studies in primary human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and in cell lines demonstrated Ikaros occupancy of the LMO2 promoter. Ikaros binding at the LMO2 promoter was confirmed by quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (qChIP) in primary T-ALL and B-ALL cells. The role of Ikaros in the regulation of LMO2 transcription in T-ALL was tested using gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments. Ikaros knock-down with siRNA resulted in increased transcription of LMO2 in T-ALL. Overexpression of Ikaros in human T-ALL was associated with strongly reduced transcription of LMO2. In mice, T-ALL cells that are derived from Ikaros-knockout mice express high levels of LMO2. Transduction of these cells with Ikaros-containing retrovirus, results in a sharp reduction of LMO2 expression. Since Ikaros function in T-ALL is negatively regulated by the pro-oncogenic Casein Kinase II (CK2), we tested whether CK2 inhibition can enhance Ikaros-mediated transcriptional repression of LMO2. Molecular inhibition of CK2 using shRNA, as well as pharmacological inhibition with a specific CK2 inhibitor, resulted in reduced expression of LMO2 in primary human T-ALL. Inhibition of CK2 was associated with increased Ikaros binding at the LMO2 promoter. Ikaros knock-down restored high expression of LMO2 in T-ALL cells that were treated with CK2 inhibitors. These data show that Ikaros is a major regulator of LMO2 transcription in T-ALL and that CK2 inhibition requires Ikaros activity to repress LMO2 transcription. Increased Ikaros binding was associated with reduced histone H3K9ac and H3K4me3 marks at the LMO2 promoter suggesting that Ikaros regulates LMO2 transcription via chromatin remodeling. In conclusion, these results provide evidence that expression of the LMO2 oncogene is regulated by Ikaros and CK2 in T-ALL. Targeting CK2 with specific inhibitors has been used as a therapeutic strategy in a preclinical model of T-ALL. The presented data reveal a novel mechanism of therapeutic action for CK2 inhibitors - repression of LMO2 expression via Ikaros. These results provide a rationale for the use of CK2 inhibitors in T-ALL with LMO2 overexpression. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
