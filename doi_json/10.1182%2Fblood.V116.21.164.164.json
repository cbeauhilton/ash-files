    "abstract_text": "Abstract 164 TMPRSS6, a transmembrane protease produced by the liver, is an essential regulator of mammalian iron homeostasis. TMPRSS6 inhibits the expression of hepcidin, a circulating peptide that decreases intestinal iron absorption and macrophage iron release, by down-regulating hepatic BMP/SMAD signaling for hepcidin production. Accordingly, TMPRSS6 mutations result in elevated hepcidin levels, impaired absorption of dietary iron, and systemic iron deficiency. Interestingly, in congenital iron loading anemias such as \u03b2-thalassemia, hepcidin levels are inappropriately low relative to body iron stores, a finding that has been postulated to result from the production of a hepcidin-repressing factor in the setting of ineffective erythropoiesis. Here we asked if Tmprss6 is required to achieve the hepcidin suppression present in Hbb th3/+ mice, a model of \u03b2-thalassemia intermedia. To test this, we bred Hbb th3/+ mice to mice harboring a targeted disruption of the Tmprss6 serine protease domain. We generated mice of various Hbb - Tmprss6 genotype combinations and compared parameters of systemic iron homeostasis at 8 weeks of age. Consistent with prior studies of Hbb th3/+ mice, Hbb th3/+ mice harboring 2 wild-type Tmprss6 alleles ( Hbb th3/+ Tmprss6 +/+ mice) showed non-heme iron concentrations of liver, spleen, and kidney that were significantly elevated compared to wild-type controls. Homozygosity for Tmprss6 mutation, however, ameliorated the iron overload phenotype of Hbb th3/+ mice and led to systemic iron deficiency. Tissue non-heme iron concentrations were markedly reduced in Hbb th3/+ Tmprss6 \u2212/\u2212 mice as compared to Hbb th3/+ Tmprss6 +/+ mice and were similar to levels observed in Tmprss6 \u2212/\u2212 mice harboring 2 wild-type Hbb alleles. Hbb th3/+ Tmprss6 \u2212/\u2212 mice had hemoglobin levels similar to the thalassemic levels present in Hbb th3/+ Tmprss6 +/+ mice. However, compared to Hbb th3/+ Tmprss6 +/+ mice, Hbb th3/+ Tmprss6 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed markedly reduced erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume and serum transferrin saturation, as well as increased red blood cell count. Interestingly, homozygous loss of Tmprss6 in Hbb th3/+ mice also led to marked reduction in splenomegaly and improvement in peripheral red blood cell morphology. Consistent with prior studies of Hbb th3/+ mice, Hbb th3/+ Tmprss6 +/+ mice displayed hepatic hepcidin mRNA levels that were similar to wild-type and were, therefore, inappropriately decreased relative to their increased hepatic iron stores. Hepatic mRNA levels of Bmp6 , encoding a Bmp ligand that is transcriptionally regulated by iron and acts as a key regulator of hepcidin expression in vivo , were significantly elevated in Hbb th3/+ Tmprss6 +/+ mice, suggesting that their relative hepcidin deficiency does not result from impaired Bmp6 transcription. While Hbb th3/+ Tmprss6 +/+ mice showed suppressed hepcidin levels, homozygous loss of Tmprss6 alleviated their hepcidin suppression and led to elevated hepcidin mRNA levels similar to Tmprss6 \u2212/\u2212 mice harboring 2 wild-type Hbb alleles. Hbb th3/+ Tmprss6 \u2212/\u2212 mice also showed elevated hepatic mRNA encoding Id1 , another transcriptional target of Bmp/Smad signaling. These findings indicate that Tmprss6 is required to achieve the suppression of hepatic hepcidin expression that underlies systemic iron overload in Hbb th3/+ mice. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that, by up-regulating hepatic Bmp/Smad signaling for hepcidin production, genetic loss of Tmprss6 induces profound changes in systemic iron homeostasis in this thalassemia model.
