    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Several recent studies have shown a gender disparity in professional doctoral introductions at major medical conferences, with female speakers being less likely to be introduced with a professional title. We sought to examine whether a similar disparity existed at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, 8 investigators reviewed available presentations from video archives of the 2018 ASH Annual Meeting. Presentations were excluded if gender could not be identified and/or speaker did not have a doctoral degree. We collected data on speaker gender, speaker academic/non-academic rank, speaker geographic location, speaker training status, speaker session type and introducer gender were all collected. A \"professional address\" was defined as either \"Dr. [First and Last Name]\" or \"Dr. [Last Name].\" Descriptive statistics and regression modelling were used to analyze the data. Results :Of the videos reviewed, 645 presentations were eligible for analysis; 380 (59%) speakers were men and 264 (41%) were women. A comparison of male and female speaker cohorts is seen in Table 1. Forty-eight percent of both men and women held a Medical Doctor degree (MD), and the rest were MD/PhD or PhD graduates. Substantially more men (28%) were full professors compared to women (13%). Almost half (47%) of session types for both men and women speakers were designated as \"basic science.\" In an adjusted analysis, more women (N=174, 66%) compared to men (N=225, 59%) received a professional address (P<.01). 43% of women were introduced by a female introducer and 42% of men were introduced by a female introducer (P=.79). In addition, 48 of the introducers (19%) for women and 68 of the introducers (18%) for men had a PhD or MD/PhD. In a logistic regression model adjusting for session type, academic rank, degree, geographic location, trainee status, and gender of introducer, there were no significant gender-based differences in professional introduction [Table 1; Odds Ratio (OR) 0.71, P=.06]. In addition, speakers with MD introducers were more likely to have a professional introduction compared to PhD introducers (OR 2.15, P=.03) regardless of sex. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that women were at least as likely as men to receive a professional address at the 2018 ASH Annual Meeting. These results differ from previous studies of other professional medical conferences. These findings may reflect the strong presence of PhD graduates as both speakers and introducers. Both forms of bias (gender and degree-based) merit further study and interventions including speaker training to ensure combatting unconscious bias.
