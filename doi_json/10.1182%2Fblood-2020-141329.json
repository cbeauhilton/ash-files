    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Acute trauma coagulopathy (ATC) is associated with severe hemorrhage. ATC etiology is often multifactorial, with acquired fibrinogen deficiency and consumption of clotting factors recognized as major factors. The FiiRST-2 study will determine the impact of early co-administration of fibrinogen concentrate (FC) and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) on the total number of allogeneic blood products (ABPs) transfused compared to the current standard of care (ratio-based plasma resuscitation). Methods: FiiRST-2 is a multicenter (8 Canadian centers), pragmatic, randomized, parallel-control, superiority trial with a two-armed, two-stage design with an adaptive interim analysis. Research ethics board approval has been obtained and the study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. Trauma patients >16 years old at risk of massive hemorrhage will be randomized to receive FC + PCC or standard of care (ratio-based plasma resuscitation + FC in response to low fibrinogen levels) (Table 1) until all units in the second massive hemorrhage protocol (MHP) pack have been administered, or earlier if the MHP is terminated. The primary endpoint is to demonstrate superiority with respect to the number of ABP units (RBCs [red blood cells] + plasma + platelets) transfused within 24 hours of arrival at the trauma bay/emergency department. Secondary endpoints include RBC units transfused within 24 hours, incidence of thromboembolic events, and ventilator-free days up to Day 28. Safety endpoints include all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) up to Day 28. It is projected to enroll 360 patients depending on the results of the Interim analysis. Results: An interim analysis will be performed after 120 patients have completed the study. The study is expected to start late 2020 and enrollment is expected to require about 2 years. Conclusions: FiiRST-2 will determine if early hemostatic therapy with FC + PCC is superior to standard MHP packs in bleeding trauma patients. Results could have a major impact on clinical practice and improve management and outcomes in this high-risk group of patients.
