    "abstract_text": "Oral mucositis (OM) is a commonly occurring side effect in patients (pts) undergoing AHSCT. Velafermin, recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-20, is under investigation for the prevention of severe OM. Previous studies demonstrated that velafermin at 30 mcg/kg was well tolerated and was effective in reducing the incidence of severe mucositis. The primary objective of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study was to confirm safety and efficacy of 30 mcg/kg velafermin for prevention of severe OM incidence (grade 3/4 OM based on the WHO grading system). The secondary objective was to evaluate safety and efficacy of 10 and 60 mcg/kg doses to better define the therapeutic range. Pts were randomized to receive placebo or velafermin at 30, 10 or 60 mcg/kg in a 3:3:1:1 ratio 24\u201336 hrs after stem cell infusion. Randomization was stratified by study center and OM risk factors identified from the previous placebo controlled study in a similar population including conditioning regimen and body mass index (BMI \u226530). Pts with multiple myeloma or lymphoma (\u226518 y.o.) receiving \u22652X10 6 /kg CD34 + cells following chemotherapy with or without Total Body Irradiation (TBI) were eligible. OM status and safety data were collected for 30 days post treatment while mortality and disease progression were followed for 1 yr. An interim analysis by a data monitoring committee (DMC) was planned to assess safety and efficacy after 50% of pts completed the 30 day treatment period. A total of 390 pts who received melphalan (200 mg/m 2 ) (n=239), BEAM (n=129), TBI (n=15), or other (n=7) were randomized and 384 pts were treated. The study drug was well tolerated in general and no pts discontinued study due to drug-related adverse events. There were 93 serious adverse events (SAEs) in 78 (20%) pts and no drug-related death was reported. Five infusion-related SAEs were reported including vasovagal episode (2), syncope (2), and anaphylactoid reaction (1). All 5 episodes occurred on the day of study drug infusion and resolved on the same day with no sequelae. Based on review of the results from the interim analysis, which included safety and efficacy data from 200 pts, the DMC recommended that the study continue to completion as planned. The last pt has completed the 30 day study period. The un-blinded results of the OM efficacy endpoints from velafermin treated groups or placebo as well as 30-day safety information from all pts will be reported."
