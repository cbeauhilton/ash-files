    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3885 Lenalidomide has promising clinical activity in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Unlike other anti-leukemia drugs, lenalidomide is not cytotoxic for CLL cells in vitro. Similar to CD154, lenalidomide can enhance CLL-cell expression of immune co-stimulatory molecules, formation of immunologic synapse, activation of NK-cells, and generation of anti-tumor immunity. Furthermore, lenalidomide repeatedly can enhance expression of CD154, which we had observed was functionally deficient in patients with CLL. However the exact mechanism of action of lenalidomide is still under investigation. Herein, we studied the gene expression profile and microRNA (miR) of CLL cells collected from 20 patients before and at day 8 and day 15 of treatment with 2.5\u20135 mg of lenalidomide in the CRC014 trial. We observed significant changes in expression level of 54 genes at day 8 versus pre-treatment samples. We identified significant changes in expression level of 189 genes at day 15 versus pre-treatment samples. This included 44 of the 54 (81%) genes noted at day 8. Forty genes were expressed at significantly higher levels at day 8 and day 15 of lenalidomide treatment. We noted that 7 (17%) of these genes were related to Ras pathway and its downstream signaling pathways (i.e. NF-KappaB pathway): Ras association (RalGDS/AF-6) domain family member 4 (RASSF4), a member of RAS oncogene family (RAB13), Ras protein-specific guanine nucleotide releasing factor 1 (RASGRF1), GTPase IMAP family member 6 (GIMAP6), GTP-binding protein ras homolog gene family member S (RND1), kinase suppressor of Ras 2 (KSR2) and toll-like receptor adaptor molecule 2 (TICAM2). Ras signaling affects many cellular functions, which includes cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, fate specification, and differentiation. In the resting cells, Ras is tightly bound to GDP (Guanosine Diphosphate), which is exchanged for GTP (Guanosine Triphosphate) upon binding to activated cell membrane receptors. In the GTP-bound form, Ras interacts with a broad range of effector proteins to induce a diverse array of biological consequences. Although typically associated with enhanced growth and transformation, activated Ras also may induce growth antagonistic effects such as senescence or apoptosis. Some of the growth-inhibitory properties of Ras are mediated via the RASSF family of Ras effector/tumor suppressors. RASSF4 is the fifth member of this family and it binds directly to activated K-Ras in a GTP-dependent manner via the effector domain, thus exhibiting the basic properties of a Ras effector. Overexpression of RASSF4 induces Ras-dependent apoptosis in 293-T cells and inhibits the growth of human tumor cell lines. Although broadly expressed in normal tissue, RASSF4 is frequently down-regulated by promoter methylation in human tumor cells and primary tumors. However changes in miR expression also may affect the level of gene expression. Therefore we analyzed miRs expression by microarray in pre treatment, day 8, and day 15 CLL samples. We observed significant changes in expression levels of 33 miRs between day 8 and pre treatment samples. We identified significant changes in expression levels of 11 miRs between day 15 and pre treatment samples. Of the 33 miRs differentially expressed at day 8, only 5 were up-regulated whereas the remaining 28 were down-regulated. Interestingly, among these 28 down-regulated miRs, 5 miRs (miR-103, miR-16, miR-30a, miR-30b and miR-342-3p) target RASSF4. Noteworthy, miR-342-3p was one of the 3 miRs (miR-26a, miR-138 and miR-342-3p) down-regulated both at day 8 and at day 15, suggesting that the down-regulation of such miR has a key role in the overexpression of RASSF4 leading to Ras-dependent apoptosis. Further studies are ongoing to elucidate lenalidomide action on CLL cells via RASSF4 overexpression. This study demonstrates that treatment with lenalidomide can induce down-regulation of miRs associated with changes in gene expression by CLL cells, leading to over-expression of RASSF4 and other Ras or GTPase related proteins that can induce growth antagonistic effects and account in part for the activity of this drug in CLL.
