    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUNDS: Extranodal natural killer (NK) /T cell lymphoma, nasal type is much common in East Asia than in Western countries. CHOP therapy is not effective for NK/T cell lymphoma because of the drug resistance induced by P glycoprotein. Yamaguchi et al reported the effectiveness of concurrent radiotherapy and DeVIC (RT-DeVIC) therapy for localized nasal NK/T cell lymphoma. Nowadays, RT-DeVIC therapy is recognized as a standard treatment. So far, we have limited information about this treatment because NK/T cell lymphoma is rare phenotype. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively the patients with localized NK/T cell lymphoma treated with RT-DeVIC therapy. Radiation therapy was administered for a total dose of 50 Gy. Concurrently, chemotherapy with dexamethasone, etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin (DeVIC) was performed up to 3 cycles. The primary objectives of this analysis were to evaluate the response rates and progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 20 patients who diagnosed as nasal NK/T cell lymphoma between April 2007 and October 2012 were analyzed. Sixteen patients were stage 1E and 4 were Stage 2E. As the NK/T cell lymphoma prognostic index, 6 patients were group 1, 10 were group 2, 3 were group 3, and 1 was group 4. Seventeen patients completed 3 cycles of DeVIC therapy and 19 patients completed planned radiation therapy. Overall response rate (ORR) was 75% and CR rate was 70% in the entire patients. Local control was 90%. Half of the patients who reached CR showed long time survival without disease progression. On the other hand, 7 of 14 patients relapsed after CR, and all 5 patients experienced systemic failure. The sites of relapse were paranasal sinuses (n=2), skin (n=3), brain (n=1), testis (n=1). Among them, one patient reached 2 nd CR. However, 5 patients were not eligible for salvage chemotherapy, because lymphoma progressed rapidly and their general condition became worse. Six patients did not reach CR after RT-DeVIC therapy. Five of them experienced systemic relapse and median survival of them was only 8 months. The median follow up time was 17.6 months (range 2 \u2013 77.9 months). Median overall survival was not reached and median progression free survival was 14.6 months. Risk factors predicted of OS or PFS were not clear. All entire patients experienced grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Mucositis was common non-hematological toxicity and it was the major cause of grade 3 or 4 appetite loss. Only one patient discontinued RT-DeVIC due to grade 3 mucositis, grade 3 dermatitis and septic shock. CONCLUSION: We reviewed treatment outcomes of 20 cases of RT-DeVIC therapy. In this analysis, the majority of relapsed or refractory cases showed systemic disease and the prognosis of these patients were poor. However, RT-DeVIC therapy showed excellent local control and response rates which were similar to the prior study. The effectiveness of RT-DeVIC therapy for patients with NK/T cell lymphoma was reconfirmed. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
