    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4715 From July 2006 to February 2009, total of 146 patients with non-APL AML were admitted in our department. Cytogenetic analyses, detection of Flt3-ITD, NPM1 gene mutation and VEGF and its receptors (Flt-1, KDR) were performed on all patients. Forty-nine patients less than 60 years of old and with normal karyotype were selected for prognostic analyses. Flt3-ITD was positive detected in 15 cases (30.61%), NPM1 mutation in 18 cases (36.73%), VEGF in 46 cases (93.88%), Flt-1 in 41 patients (84.04%) and KDR in 38 cases (77.55%). After one or two courses of induction therapy with IDA regimen (Idarubicin + cytarabine: 3+7) in all 49 patients, total CR rate was 67.43% (33/49). One patient died because of severe invasive fungal infection. Among the remaining 15 non-CR patients, 10 were Flt3-ITD positive and NPM1 negative, and all with higher expression of VEGF and KDR. All the CR patients were treated with consolidation regimen with high dose cytarabine (3g/m 2 , q 12h iv for 3 consecutive days) for 6 courses. After follow-up at least for 6 months, only 12 patients are alive up to now. In these 12 patients, Flt3-ITD were all negative expressed, 6 patients were NPM1 positive, 2 patients VEGF negative, 3 patients both KDR and Flt-1 negative. There are no patients alive with positive expressed of Flt3-ITD, KDR and negative expressed of NPM1. Therefore, we supposed that negative expression of Flt3-ITD and KDR plus positive expression of NPM1 could be a favorable parameter for outcome prediction in AML patients with normal karyotype.
