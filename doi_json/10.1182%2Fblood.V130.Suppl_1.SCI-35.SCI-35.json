    "abstract_text": "The PD-1 pathway delivers inhibitory signals that function as a brake for immune responses and has wide-ranging immunoregulatory functions. Signals through the PD-1 pathway limit T cell activation and effector T cell responses. The PD-1 pathway also promotes T cell tolerance, inhibiting responses of self-reactive T cells. PD-L1 on non-hematopoietic cells can restrain T cell responses in tissue, thereby protecting tissues from immune-mediated damage and autoimmune attack. Tumors have exploited the pathway to establish an immunosuppressive microenvironment, and evade immune eradication. The critical role of PD-1 in preventing antitumor immunity is demonstrated by the transformative effects of PD-1 pathway blockade in a broad range of cancers. Although PD-1 pathway inhibitors are revolutionizing cancer treatment, the mechanisms by which PD-1 regulates anti-tumor immunity are not fully understood. Further work is needed to understand mechanisms by which PD-1 pathway blockade induces anti-tumor immunity, and why PD-1 pathway blockade works or fails. This knowledge is needed to identify those who will benefit from PD-1 cancer immunotherapy and to develop rational combination therapies. This talk will discuss mechanisms by which PD-1 and its ligands control tumor immunity, including the relative contribution of tumor or host-derived PD-L1, and the impact of PD-1 modulation on metabolic fitness of T cells in the tumor microenvironment.
