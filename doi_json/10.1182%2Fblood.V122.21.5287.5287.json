    "abstract_text": "Background B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is a heterogeneous disease with a highly variable clinical outcome. Recent studies have identified a number of different molecular prognostic markers (including mutational status of the IgVH gene, ZAP70 and CD38 expression) that allow to discriminate patients in prognostic subgroups. However, different expression patterns of angiogenic factors as VEGF , VEGFR1 and bFGF have been related with B-CLL susceptibility and treatment requirements. We have analyzed the polymorphisms: -710 C/T in VEGFR1, rs1109324, rs1547651, rs3025039 (936C/T) and rs833052 in VEGF and rs1449683 (223 C/T) in bFGF in order to determine the possible association with susceptibility in B-CLL. Methods Peripheral blood samples from 230 B-CLL patients and 476 healthy controls were genotyped using probes TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays. Samples were providing from the Hospital Clinic of Valencia. Four SNPs in the VEGF gene, one SNP in the bFGF gene and one SNP in the VEGFR1 gene were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed using SNPStats program (Catalan Institute of Oncology) and Fisher's exact test was applied to evaluate the significance. Results We have observed an increased frequency of the T allele in the rs1449683 SNP [OR 1.62 (95% CI: 0.98-2.66) p-value =0.063] and in the rs1547651 SNP [OR 0.72 (95% CI: 0.51-1.03), p-value=0.072] in our B-LLC patients when compared to control subjects. Moreover we observed that T allele carriers of rs3025039 (VEGF) have a significant protective effect concerning this disease [OR 0.59 (95% CI: 0.39-0.89) p-value=0.009]. Conclusion Our data indicate an increased frequency of the T allele in polymorphisms rs1449683 (bFGF) and rs1547651 (VEGF) in the group of patients, which possibly account for the individual susceptibility to develop B-CLL. On the other hand the data provided suggest that the T allele of VEGF rs3025039 is likely important genetic marker of susceptibility to B-CLL. Further studies regarding the role of pro-angiogenic markers in B-CLL would be beneficial to help elucidate pathogenic pathways in this disease.
