    "abstract_text": "Introduction : TP53 mutated ( TP53m ) MDS and AML have very poor outcome irrespective of the treatment received, including 40% responses (20% CR) with azacitidine (AZA) with short response duration and a median overall survival (OS) of about 8 months (Bejar, Blood 2014). APR-246 is a prodrug spontaneously converted to methylene quinuclidinone (MQ), a Michael acceptor that binds covalently to cysteines in mutant p53, leading to protein reconformation that reactivates its pro apoptotic and cell cycle arrest functions. The combination of AZA and APR 246 showed promising results in a phase Ib study in TP53m MDS (Sallman, ASH 2018). We report interim results of a GFM phase 2 study of AZA+ APR-246 in TP53m MDS and AML, conducted in parallel with a similar US MDS consortium study. Patients and Methods : The study included hypomethylating agent (HMA) na\u00efve and not previously allografted intermediate, high or very high IPSS-R TP53m MDS and AML adult patients. Patients received APR-246 4500 mg IV /d (6 hour infusions) (days 1-4) followed by AZA 75 mg/m\u00b2/d (days 4-10) in 28 day cycles. Response (primary endpoint, assessed by IWG 2006 for MDS and ELN criteria for AML) was evaluated after 3 and 6 cycles in the intent to treat (ITT) population, ie all patients who had received any protocol treatment, and in patients who had at least a blood and bone marrow evaluation after cycle 3 (evaluable population). Allo-SCT, when possible, was proposed after 3 to 6 cycles, and treatment with reduced APR 246 and AZA doses could be continued after allo-SCT. Results : 53 patients were enrolled between Sept 2018 and July 2019 in 7 GFM centers, with a median age of 73 years (range 44-87), and M/F: 28/25. 34 patients had MDS (including 74% very high IPSS-R) and 19 had AML. IPSS-R cytogenetic risk was very poor in 30/34 MDS, and unfavorable in 18/19 AML, complex in 89% of the patients. Median baseline mutated TP53 VAF was 21% (range 3-76). Nineteen of the 53 patients had been included at least 7 months before date of analysis (25 July 2019), had received protocol treatment and were thus potentially evaluable for response after 6 treatment cycles (ITT population). One of them died after only one cycle from an unrelated cause (cerebral ischemic stroke), and 2 during the third cycle (from bleeding and sepsis, respectively). In the remaining 16 patients (evaluable population per protocol), the response rate was 75% including 9 (56%) CR, 3 (19%) marrow CR or stable disease with hematological improvement (HI), and 4 treatment resistance. In the ITT population, the response rate was 63%, including 47% CR, and 16% stable or marrow CR+ HI. Among CR patients, complete cytogenetic CR and negative NGS for TP53 mutation (VAF cutoff of 2%) were achieved in 7/9 (78%) and 8/8 (100%), respectively. So far, 1 patient has undergone allo-SCT. All 53 patients had received at least one treatment cycle, and no increased myelosuppression, compared with AZA alone, was apparent. Treatment related AEs observed in \u2265 20% of patients were febrile neutropenia in 19 (36%) and neurological AEs in 21 (40%) of the patients. The latter, reviewed with a neurological team, were mainly grade 1 or 2 and consisted of ataxia (n=13), sometimes associated with cognitive impairment (n=4), suggesting a cerebellar origin. Other patients experienced acute confusion (n=4), isolated dizziness (n=3) and facial paresthesia (n=1). Neurological AEs reached grade III in 3 cases (1 acute confusion, 2 ataxia). Occurrence of neurological AEs was correlated with lower glomerular filtration rate at treatment onset (p<0.01) and higher age (p=0.05). Neurological symptoms spontaneously regressed within 5 days of drug discontinuation (after a median of 1 day). They did not recur in the following cycles after per protocol APR 246 dose reductions. Conclusion : In this very high-risk elderly population of TP53m MDS and AML, generally with complex karyotype, a promising 56% CR rate at 6 cycles was reached in the evaluable population with AZA+ APR 246 combination, with deep molecular remission in all CR patients. We observed manageable neurologic AEs, mainly in elderly patients with reduced renal function, who therefore require close monitoring and dose reduction if necessary. An update regarding safety and efficacy in the 53 patients, including survival data, will be available at the meeting. A phase III international trial comparing AZA alone and AZA+ APR 246 in TP53m MDS is ongoing. Disclosures Cluzeau: Abbvie: Consultancy; Jazz Pharma: Consultancy; Menarini: Consultancy.
