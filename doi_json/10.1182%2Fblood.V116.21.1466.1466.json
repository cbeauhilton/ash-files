    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1466 Background: Histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDAC) regulate gene expression through acetylation-deacetylation of histones. HDACs are the target of a family of compounds known as HDAC inhibitors, which have been shown to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduce acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) while preserving the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in mice. However, the role of individual HDAC members in the development of GVHD is not clear. Recently, HDAC11, the newest member of the HDAC family has emerged as an important transcriptional regulator of inflammatory responses in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) 1 . Here, we evaluated the role of HDAC11 on APCs and T cells in the allogeneic BMT setting in mice with genetic disruption of HDAC11. Method: Proliferation of wild-type (WT) and HDAC11 knock-out (KO) T cells in response to allogeneic antigens was compared by [H 3 ] thymidine incorporation assay. Using the same method, we also tested the antigen presentation ability of WT and HDAC11 KO APCs. For in vivo studies, we used a clinical relevant mouse model of BMT: C57BL/6 (B6) \u00ae BALB/c. To evaluate the role of HDAC11 in the function of T cells and APCs, WT and KO mice on B6 background were used as donors and recipients, respectively. Recipient survival was monitored daily and GVHD symptom was evaluated at least twice a week. HDAC11 KO mice were supplied by Merck and Co., Inc. Results: In vitro , HDAC11 KO T cells proliferated stronger than WT T cells under the stimulation of allogeneic APCs. Recipients of HDAC11 KO T cells lost significantly more body weight (p < 0.05), and died significantly sooner than those of WT T cells (p < 0.01). The pathologic score of KO recipients was higher than that of WT recipients in each of GVHD target organs including lung, liver, small intestine and colon. Mechanistically, we found that there were significantly more total and IFN\u03b3-producing donor T cells in the recipients of KO cells than those of WT cells (p < 0.05). Collectively, HDAC11 KO T cells have higher activity in response to alloantigens in vitro and induced more severe GVHD in vivo compared to WT T cells. In contrast, KO and WT APCs had a similar ability to stimulate allogeneic T cells in vitro , and no significant difference in GVHD development was observed in WT or KO recipients after allogeneic BMT. Conclusion: HDAC11 negatively regulates T-cell function, but has no significant effect on APC function. This finding provides a rationale to promote T-cell immunity or tolerance by inhibiting or enhancing HDAC11, respectively. 1 Villagra et al. Nature Immunology, 10:92-100, 2009.
