    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4979 Objective To investigate the related factors of the malignant clone burden of patients with Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and explore the risk factors of cytogenetic evolution of MDS. Methods Seventy-three cases of MDS patients were enrolled in this study who received treatment in the hematological department of General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University from 2004 to 2009. Statistics methods such as t -test, Chi-square test and Logistic regression analysis were used to investigate the correlation between the malignant clone burden and its related factors such as bone marrow dysplasia, peripheral blood and iron metabolism indexes. Furthermore, the risk factors of cytogenetic evolution of MDS were also analyzed. Results Odd number-nucleus erythrocytes, double-nucleus granulocytes, hypolobated neutrophils were significantly correlated to high malignant clone burden ( P <0.05). PAS positive patients and patients with dysplasia in three myeloid lineages, blasts in peripheral blood exhibited significantly higher malignant clone burden ( P <0.05). Patients with abnormal karyotype presented significantly higher level of serum ferritin and lower level of unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) than those with normal karyotype ( P <0.05). Odd number-nucleus erythrocytes, megaloblastic granulocytes and high myeloid differentiation index (DI) are risk factors indicating cytogenetic evolution of MDS patients. Conclusion The indexes of high malignant clone burden of MDS include: odd number-nucleus erythrocytes, double-nucleus granulocytes, hypolobated neutrophils, dysplasia in three myeloid lineages, blasts in peripheral blood, positive PAS, high level of serum ferritin and low level of UIBC. The risk factors of cytogenetic evolution of MDS include: odd number-nucleus erythrocytes, megaloblastic granulocytes and high myeloid DI. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
