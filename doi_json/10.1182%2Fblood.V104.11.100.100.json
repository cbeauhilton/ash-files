    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the most effective therapy for myeloid leukemias. Still, especially patients with refractory disease, unfavourable cytogenetics or blast transformation of a myeloproliferative disorder (mpd) have a poor prognosis as a result of a high rate of treatment related mortality and relapse with conventional conditioning regimens. Recently, Kolb et al. have introduced a sequential protocol utilizing early TBI-based non-myeloablative transplantation following conventional induction therapy in high-risk patients. In this study, in dependence to Kolb, we have treated 21 patients (median age 51 years, range 17\u201363, 4 female, 17 male) with advanced leukemias according to an intensified sequential high-dose protocol. Diagnoses were AML (primary refractory 2, relapsed 5), MDS (refractory 7, untreated 1) and blast transformation of a MPD (refractory 6, untreated 0). The median blast count at induction was 22% (range 1\u201390) and 9 patients (43 %) had unfavourable cytogenetics. Induction therapy consisted of fludarabine, high-dose cytarabine with or without idarubicine, amsacrine or topotecan. ATG, high-dose melphalan with or without high-dose thiotepa was used for conditioning while patients were still cytopenic from the preceeding induction therapy. Following transplantation of a median of 6.1x10E6 CD34+ cells/kg (range 0.85\u201312.0) from related (6) or unrelated (15) donors, the median time to a wbc>1000/\u03bcl and plt>20000/\u03bcl was 15 days (range 10\u201324) and 17 days (range 8\u201330), respectively. No toxic death was observed during the first 30 days and 95% of patients achieved CR by day 28, 100% by day 50. Twelve patients (57%) developed aGvHD (12I-II\u00b0, 0III-IV\u00b0) and 7 patients (33%) at risk have developed chronic GvHD (5 limited, 2 extensive) so far. After a median time of 181 days (range 3 \u2013 596 days) fifteen patients (72%) are alive and all are in complete remission. Six patients died, one of infection (5%), two of a combination of a chronic GvHD and infections (9%), two of disease progression (9%) and one patient from a second malignancy (SCLC). We conclude that early sequential transplantation during induction therapy induced cytopenia using high-dose melphalan and thiotepa based conditioning is feasible and highly effective in patients with advanced myeloid leukemias and poor prognosis. Although these early results are promising, a longer follow up and comparison with standard regimens are required.",
