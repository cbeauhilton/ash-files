    "abstract_text": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and increased risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The identification of genes and cellular pathways active in leukemia cells but not in normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC) may help to understand the key steps in the MDS and AML pathogenesis and lead to new approaches to further enhance the treatment of both diseases, considered incurable with non-transplantation therapy. Src kinase family (SFK) is a central mediator in multiple oncogenic signaling pathways and some SFK members (Hck, Lyn, Fgr, Fyn) had previously been described as overexpressed or activated in leukemic cells. However, to this moment, the role of hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK), the unique SFK member restricted expressed in hematopoietic cells, had not been characterized in MDS and AML pathogenesis as well as in HSC. In order to better understand the HCK importance in hematopoiesis, we used lentiviral shRNA vectors to knockdown the HCK expression in primary human CD34 + HSC. The HCK levels were reduced in approximately 70-80% (shHCK) compared to the control lentiviral shRNA (shControl-GFP). To promote erythroid differentiation, human CD34 + transduced cells were grown in methylcellulose for 7 days and in liquid media for another 6 days. During this experiment, shHCK cells showed decreased cell viability (fold change compared to shControl-GFP = 0.55, P< .0001, n=3) combined with an increase in CD71+ expression (fold change compared to shControl-GFP = 3, P< .01, n=3), indicating a delay in erythroid differentiation. As expected, shControl-GFP cells showed a decreased GATA1 expression during erythroid differentiation. Meanwhile, shHCK cells did not modulate GATA1 expression. Interestingly, without any stimulus, HCK knockdown in CD34 + cells significantly decreased apoptosis (AnnexinV+ cells) compared to shControl-GFP (fold change = 0.52, P< .01, n=4). Attempts have been made to overexpress HCK in CD34 + HSC, however more than 80% cells were apoptotic and further assays were not possible. Thus, in HSC, HCK participates of erythroid differentiation and apoptosis signaling. According to the HCK importance on HSC and that SFK inhibitors are undergoing early phase clinical testing, a specific inhibitory activity compound for HCK, named iHCK-37, had been developed by Dr Maurizzio Botta. We tested this compound on primary normal human CD34 + cells originated from healthy donors bone marrow samples and also from cord blood units. The iHCK-37 treatment did not change proliferation, survival and death of these normal CD34 + cells. Conversely, MDS and AML CD34 + cells treated with the same drug exhibited a dose-dependent growth inhibition. Likewise, following iHCK-37 treatment of MDS and AML total bone marrow mononuclear cells, the BFU-E and CFUs colony numbers were significantly decreased compared to untreated cells (vehicle). We also observed a potent in vitro antiproliferative activity of iHCK-37 against a panel of leukemia cell lines, with uM IC 50 values in AML (5.0 - 5.8uM) and chronic myeloid leukemia (9.1 - 19.2uM). In addition, the combinatory in vitro treatment of iHCK-37 and 5-Azacitidine (Aza) also demonstrated additive effects relative to either drug alone. Interestingly, iHCK-37 or iHCK-37 plus Aza treatments of dysplastic and leukemia cells enhanced apoptosis and resulted in increased BAX and reduced BCL-XL protein levels. This result could be clinically relevant for MDS, as Aza is the only treatment available for higher-risk MDS, but with low response rates and frequent induced resistance and refractoriness over time. In summary, we herein have shown that HCK mRNA knockdown of normal CD34 + cells resulted in growth inhibition, decreased cell death and reduced erythroid differentiation, suggesting that HCK is essential for normal hematopoiesis. We presume that the deregulation of HCK pathway in leukemic cells might be crucial for MDS and AML pathogenesis. On the other hand, the inhibition of HCK protein activity with a specific inhibitor was able to restore the apoptotic pathways of leukemic cells, acting on cancer cells without alter any signaling of normal cells. Moreover, the specific inhibitor may have antineoplastic effect that can even be additive to current available drugs. Our study adds new insights to the role of HCK in MDS and AML as well as into potential new anticancer treatment strategies. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
