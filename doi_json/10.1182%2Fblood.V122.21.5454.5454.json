    "abstract_text": "Background Levels of cytokines, chemokines and soluble molecules fluctuate after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). These biomarkers are possible to be a diagnostic and prognostic value for transplantation-associated coagulopathy (TAC). In the present study, we investigated the effects of recombinant thrombomodulin (rTM) on levels of the cytokines, chemokines, and soluble factors registered in the \u2018SIGHT\u2019 research. SIGHT comprises the capital letters of five complications after HSCT, namely sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS same as VOD), infection, GVHD, hemophagocytic syndrome and thrombotic microangiopathy. Methods The subjects were 159 patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT (bone marrow = 83, peripheral blood stem cells = 31, cord blood = 45). Blood samples were collected before and after transplantation. Levels of cytokines (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, high-mobility group box (HMGB) 1), chemokines (monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, RANTES), and soluble molecules (soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, soluble E-selectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, platelet-derived microparticles (PDMP)) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The rTM was administered as a therapy for transplantation-associated coagulopathy (TAC). This protocol was completed in day 4-14 after HSCT and consisted of day doses of 380 unit/kg with every days. Control group was also used heparin or no anti-coagulation therapy. Results MCP-1, IL-6, and TNF-a exhibited more significant elevations on days 7\u201314 after HSCT. In contrast, the levels of HMGB1, sE-selectin, sVCAM-1, PAI-1 and PDMP exhibited significant changes on days 14\u201328. There were significant improvements in TNF-a, sE-selectin, sVCAM-1, HMGB1, PAI-1 and PDMP after rTM-treatment (n=73), but not after rTM-untreatment patients (n=86). Conclusion We believe one of causes for TAC is pro-inflammatory cytokine including HMGB1. For this reason, it is thought that the direct anti-inflammatory effect of rTM\u2019s lectin domein plays an important role in therapeutic mechanism for TAC. The present findings suggest the possibility that rTM can play a therapeutic role for TAC after allogeneic HSCT. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
