    "abstract_text": "Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are regulated by their immediate microenvironment or niche. The most potent functional HSCs are enriched at the endosteum near the bone, which comprises ~10% of total bone marrow (BM). To identify novel niche factors that regulate HSCs, we performed a gene expression microarray seeking genes that were >2-fold overexpressed in the endosteal BM relative to the central BM. In this screen, we uncovered known essential HSC niche factors overexpressed in the endosteal BM such as Scf , Cxcl12 , and Angpt1 , which validated our approach. Among the genes overexpressed in the endosteal BM, prostaglandin I 2 (PGI 2 ) synthase ( Ptgis ) was one of the highest enriched genes in the endosteum (>10-fold by qRT-PCR, p<0.001). Within the endosteal BM, Ptgis was most abundantly expressed by osteoblasts, followed by mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells and endothelial cells. Ptgis is the sole enzyme responsible for biosynthesis of PGI 2 , originally discovered as a potent anti-thrombotic and vasodilating agent. PGI 2 has no reported roles in HSC regulation in the BM and was chosen as candidate niche factor for further investigation. Due to the extreme lability of PGI 2 , we employed a clinically approved PGI 2 analogue iloprost for all subsequent experiments. In initial experiments where we cultured fluorescence activated cell sorted (FACS) BM lineage - Kit + Sca-1 - (LKS + ) haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) for 7 days in serum free conditions, we found iloprost treatment potently reduced proliferation and differentiation compared to vehicle controls, assessed by flow cytometry phenotyping (p<0.0001). To determine whether iloprost treatment alters HSC function, we pulse treated whole BM cells with iloprost for 1 hour before competitive transplant and found iloprost pulse-treatment resulted in 14-fold increased multilineage reconstitution potential (p<0.05). This suggests that PGI 2 enhances HSC function by dampening differentiation. We next sought to determine whether iloprost affects HSC function in vivo . In steady state, low dose 0.1mg/kg iloprost administration to mice for 15 days did not alter BM HSPC phenotypes by flow cytometry nor HSC reconstitution potential in competitive transplants compared to vehicle controls suggesting PGI 2 does not alter HSC function in homeostasis. To further test the effect of PGI 2 following stress, mice were sub-lethally (6.5 Gy) irradiated or administered pro-inflammatory granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for 3 days. We found low dose iloprost administration partially rescued BM HSC reconstitution potential 21 days following irradiation (p<0.05) or 3 days following G-CSF administration (p<0.01). These data suggest that PGI 2 protects HSC from stress. To understand the extrinsic mechanisms through which PGI 2 regulates HSC in the BM following stress, we performed a HSC homing assay using na\u00efve donors transplanted into 2-day G-CSF administered recipients. Analysis of HSPC homing to the BM at 4 hours post-transplantation revealed ~4-fold greater proportion of LKS + HSPC homing to the BM of iloprost co-administered recipients compared to vehicle controls (p<0.01). We assessed mRNA expression of essential HSC niche factors in the BM of 2-day G-CSF-administered mice and found that G-CSF administration decreased Scf and Cxcl12 expression, which were both partially rescued with iloprost co-administration (p<0.05). Together the data suggest that preservation of the BM niche function is one of the mechanisms through which PGI 2 protects HSC during stress. In summary, we have identified PGI 2 as a novel HSC niche factor abundant in the endosteal BM. PGI 2 analogues like Iloprost are well-tolerated and used clinically to treat vascular diseases such as pulmonary arterial hypertension and Raynaud's phenomenon. Our research suggests that PGI 2 analogues can be rapidly repurposed in the clinic to improve HSC transplant outcomes and protect against BM failure following acute stressors such as accidental irradiation or inflammation.
