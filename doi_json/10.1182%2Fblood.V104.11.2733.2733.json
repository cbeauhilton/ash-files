    "abstract_text": "The goal of the study was to evaluate long-term outcome of patients treated within 4\u201396 trial by the Polish Adult Leukemia Group (PALG). Sixty four patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (median age 26 years, range 16\u201358) were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy alone (n=31) or chemotherapy and glucosylated G-CSF (lenograstim) (n=33). Both groups were well-balanced in terms of age, initial WBC, immunophenotype and bcr/abl positivity. Induction therapy consisted of epirubicin+vincristin (Epi/Vcr) on days 1, 8, 15, 22, prednisone on days 1\u201328, L-asparaginase 8 doses starting from day 13; consolidation treatment included twice methotrexate+etoposide (Mtx/Vep), twice high dose cytarabine and cyclophosphamide (HDAraC/Ctx), CNS irradiation and intrathecal Mtx. In T-derived ALL, additional HDAraC/Ctx was administered instead of the first Mtx/HDAraC. During induction patients received G-CSF 150 \u03bcg/m 2 sc. on days 2\u20136, 9\u201313, 16\u201320, 23-until the neutrophil recovery >1.0x10 9 /L, starting 36 hours after Epi/Vcr, finishing 48 hours before the next dose; in consolidation - following each HDAraC/Ctx course on days 5\u201316. High risk patients having a donor were performed allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in first complete remission, whereas those without a donor were given autologous transplant. At seven years the overall survival rate equalled 42% for G-CSF group and 24% for the controls (p=0.11). There was also a trend to higher probability of leukemia-free survival in advantage of patients receiving the cytokine (38% vs. 20%, p=0.17). The above differences might have resulted from: 1) Higher CR rate in the G-CSF group compared to the controls (94% vs. 87%), 2) Better adherence to the chemotherapy protocol (faster completion of induction-consolidation programme by 19 days, p=0.005, less dose reductions or delays), which in turn might have influenced the risk of relapse. We conclude that time sequenced G-CSF administration may improve long-term outcome of adult ALL patients although the study including larger population is required to confirm this hypothesis.",
