    "abstract_text": "IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1) is a transcription factor involved in lymphoid differentiation that acts as a tumor suppressor. In B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) loss of IKZF1 is found in ~15% of the patients, is associated with the presence of BCR/ABL1 (t(9;22)(q34;q11)) and confers a poor clinical outcome. Recent studies suggest that IKZF1 is also involved in myeloid differentiation. The best indication that loss of IKZF1 may contribute to myeloid leukemogenesis are deletions of the short arm of chromosome 7 associated with myeloproliferative-preceded secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults, where the commonly deleted region is mapped to the IKZF1 locus (Jager et al, Leukemia 2010). To investigate whether IKZF1 deletions play a role in pediatric AML we screened a representative well-characterized panel of 258 de novo pediatric AML samples with available gene expression data, obtained from the DCOG (The Hague, the Netherlands), the AML\u2013Berliner-Frankfurt-M\u00fcnster Study Group (Germany and Czech Republic), the Saint-Louis Hospital (Paris, France) and the Royal Hospital for Sick Children (Glasgow, UK) for deletions of the IKZF1 locus on chromosome 7p12.2 using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Median age of the patients was 9.5 years (range 0.1-18.5 years), median white blood cell count was 46.7x10 9 /L (range 1.2-483x10 9 /L). All major cytogenetic subgroups were included and all patients had received intensive cytarabine-anthracycline based pediatric AML therapy. Of 11 patients with an IKZF1 deletion, 8 cases presented with monosomy 7, and 3 cases showed a focal deletion of IKZF1 . These focal deletions included the complete IKZF1 gene (n=2) or exons 1-4 (n=1), leading to a loss of IKZF1 function. Focal deletions were confirmed by high-resolution array comparative genome hybridization (array-CGH). Patients with a focal deletion included a 1.5 year old boy diagnosed with AML with a fusion of MNX1/ETV6 who died from relapse; an 11.3 year old girl diagnosed with AML M5 who remains in continuous complete remission (CCR) after salvage therapy for relapse; and a 2.3 year old boy diagnosed with AML M5 in CCR. IKZF1 deleted cases (n=11) did not differ significantly from the other pediatric AML cases (n=247) with regards to age at diagnosis (median age 9.1 years compared to 9.5 years respectively, p=0.41); gender (females 55% versus 42%, p=0.41); or white blood cell count at diagnosis (median 30.2 x10 9 /L versus 47.5 x10 9 /L, p=0.24). No specific FAB morphology subtypes were related to IKZF1 deletions. IKZF1 deleted samples showed either none or various different additional somatic mutations, most frequently activating the RAS pathway with mutations in NRAS or PTPN11 (n=4,). In BCP-ALL IKZF1 deletions are associated with BCR/ABL1 fusions and to test if this was also true for IKZF1 deletions in AML we screened samples for the BCR/ABL1 fusion and all were negative. The 3-year pOS in IKZF1 deleted patients (n=11) was 70\u00b114% versus 63\u00b13% (p=0.82) in IKZF1 wild-type patients (n=231). The 3-year pEFS was 36\u00b115% versus 46\u00b13%, and the 3-year pCIR was 64\u00b116% versus 36\u00b13% (p=0.87 and p=0.09) respectively. Genes differentially expressed in monosomy 7 cases correlated significantly with gene expression changes in focal IKZF1 deleted cases when comparing significant differences to non- IKZF1- deleted cases (n=247). Genes showing increased expression in IKZF1 deleted samples included those involved in myeloid cell cycling and self-renewal, such as HEMGN, FHL2, FZD6, and SETBP1 . In summary, we found focal IKZF1 deletions to be rare but recurrent events in pediatric AML. Gene expression patterns suggest that the loss of IKZF1 may be an important determinant in the biology of pediatric AML with monosomy 7. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
