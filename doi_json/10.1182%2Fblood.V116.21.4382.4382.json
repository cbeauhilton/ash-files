    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4382 Background: The proteasome plays a critical role in the regulation of many cellular processes, including the cell cycle and tumor growth. The proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib has been used in multiple myeloma and other lymphoid malignancies because of its antitumor activity. Here we investigated the induction of apoptosis by proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines SHI-1 cells and try to explore the mechanism of anti-leukemia. Method: We incubated SHI-1 leukemic cells with different concentration of bortezomib. cell proliferation was detected with MTT, apoptosis was measured by FCM, the protein expression of PI3K and p-Akt were determined by Western blot. Result: 0.5ug/ml bortezomib suppressed SHI-1 cells proliferation and induced SHI-1 cells apoptosis after incubated 24hr, 100ug/ml bortezomib suppressed 61.7% SHI-1 cells proliferation. Apoptosis increased obviously with the increasing bortezomib concentration and the culture time, about 39.77% SHI-1 cells were apoptosis when bortezomib concentration was 100ug/ml, the leukemia cell apoptosis was significant at 150ng/ml bortezomib, the protein expression of PI3K, and p-Akt gradually declined with bortezomib concentration increasing, The protein expression of PI3K and p-Akt in SHI-1 cells decreased 50.6% and 71.6% respectively at 100ug/ml bortezomib for 48hr.when 150ng/ml bortezomib incubated with leukemia cells for 24 hours, The protein expression of PI3K and p-Akt were lowest. Conclusion: Bortezomib could inhibit SHI-1 cells proliferation and induce leukemia cells apoptosis, and could down-regulate the expression of PI3K and p-Akt significantly, this might be the one of mechanisms that bortezomib induce SHI-1 cells apoptosis, we presume that bortezomib inhibit proliferation of acute myelogenous leukemia cells through effect of PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.
