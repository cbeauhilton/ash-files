    "abstract_text": "Activated macrophages over-express a receptor for the vitamin, folic acid. Conjugation of folic acid to low molecular weight drugs, genes, liposomes, nanoparticles, and imaging agents does not significantly compromise the vitamin\u2019s affinity for its receptor, thus facilitating both therapeutic and imaging agents to be targeted as folate conjugates to activated macrophages. In these studies the in vivo kinetics and binding characteristics of the folate receptor on macrophages has been characterized with the objective of optimizing targeted drug delivery. Our results show that saturation of the receptor in inflamed tissues can be reached at a dose of 100 nmol/kg. Furthermore, the rapid recycling characteristics of the receptor (every 10\u201320 minutes) suggests that frequent dosing will allow for maximal uptake of folate conjugates by activated macrophages accumulated in inflamed tissues. Finally, the short circulation half-life (30 minutes) of the water-soluble folate conjugate used in this study minimizes the possibility of nonspecific uptake by receptor-negative tissues. The kinetic observations made in this study can be utilized to optimize the therapeutic efficacy and imaging agent delivery of folate conjugates to activated macrophages in vivo ."
