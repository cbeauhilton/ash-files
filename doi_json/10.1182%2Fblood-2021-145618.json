    "abstract_text": "Objective: To deepen the understanding of the clinical manifestations of acquired hemophilia A for timely and correctly treatment. Methods: The clinical data of the acquired hemophilia A patients diagnosed in the hospital from Jan 2006 to Mar 2021 were retrospectively analyzed, and the relevant literature was reviewed. Results: 17 patients with acquired hemophilia A, male: female =10: 7, median age 61 years (19 to 78 years), were diagnosed and treated in the hospital with the median time from the onset to diagnosis 21 days (2 days to 6 months). Six patients had comorbidity, including hepatitis B carrying, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, diabetes, hypertension and positive autoantibodies, pemphigoid and gastric cancer, respectively. Other 11 patients were healthy before the onset. All patients had large large ecchymosis of skin, and one case was combined with hematuria, and one case with retroperitoneal hematoma. All patients had APTT extension (45s-144.7s) and the prolonged APTT could not be corrected with normal mixed plasma with and without incubation at 37\u2103 for 2 hours. FVIII activity was 1% - 8.9% and inhibitor titer 2 - 128 Bu/ml. All patients with bleeding were with prothrombin complex/recombinant activated coagulation factor VII, some of them with pd-coagulation factor FVIII preparations. Inhibitors were removed with prednisone acetate (1 case) + chemotherapy (1 case), prednisone acetate / + CTX (11 cases) + chemotherapy (1 case), prednisone acetate/prednisolone + mabthera (2 cases) + CTX (1 case), respectively. The removal time of inhibitor was from 8 days to 4 years. During the treatment process, two patients developed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and one patient was complicated with lung infection. Conclusion: Patients with unexplained bleeding and prolonged APTT should be conducted normal mixed plasma correction test, coagulation factor activity and inhibitor titer examination. After correctly diagnosis, bypass agents /coagulation factor VIII preparations should be given timely for hemostasis, protocol based on glucocorticoid + CTX/mabthera to remove the inhibitor and symptomatic treatment for patients with primary comorbidity disease at the same time.
