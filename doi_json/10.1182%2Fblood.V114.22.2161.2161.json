    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2161 Poster Board II-138 The JAK2 V617F mutation in exon 14 is the most common mutation in chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). While other point mutations and small deletions and insertions in exons 12, 13, and 14 have been reported in the JAK2 JH2 domain, deletion of the entire exon 14 is rarely detected in patients with MPNs. In a series of >10,000 samples from patients with suspected MPNs tested for JAK2 mutations by direct sequencing of mRNA, we detected a complete exon 14 (88 bp) deletion mutation in <1% of those with JAK2 mutation. This appears to be an alternative splicing mutation, not detectable with DNA-based testing, leading to a frameshift deletion in the JAK2 JH2 domain and the expression of a truncated protein (S593I fsX8). Although this mutation was present at detectable levels (>15% of total JAK2 transcript) in a small proportion of MPN cases, we decided to investigate the possibility it may be expressed at low levels (<15% of JAK2 transcript) in patients with MPNs. Using a sensitive reverse transcription-PCR\u2014based fluorescent fragment analysis method to quantify the percentage of truncated (minus exon 14) JAK2 mRNA as compared to wild-type, we tested 61 patients with confirmed MPN; 183 patients with suspected MPNs (93 V617F positive, 90 V617F negative); and 46 healthy normal control subjects. The wild-type PCR product was 273 bp, while the exon 14 splice mutant displayed a 185-bp peak. All samples with a splicing mutant expression to wild-type ratio >15% were confirmed by direct sequencing. The JAK2 exon 14 splice mutation was detected at low levels in 9 of the 61 MPN patients (15%), accounting for 3.96% to 33.85% (mean=12.04%) of JAK2 transcript in these individuals. Among the 183 suspected MPN patients, the exon 14 splice variant was detected in 20 of the 93 (21.5%) with V617F (mean expression level relative to wild type=5.41%, range=2.13%-26.22%) and 31 of the 90 (34.4%) without V617F (mean expression=3.88%; range=2.08%-12.22%). All 46 normal individuals were considered negative for the alternatively spliced transcript. In conclusion, the expression of an alternatively spliced JAK2 mRNA with deletion of exon 14, leading to a truncated JAK2 protein, is a common abnormality in patients with MPNs. This alternatively spliced transcript is more common in MPN patients without V617F mutation and might contribute to the leukemogenesis in these patients. Low levels of JAK2 exon 14 splice mutation may also contribute to the effects of the V617F mutation in patients with MPNs. However, this mutation is missed if DNA and not the RNA is used for testing for JAK2 mutations. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
