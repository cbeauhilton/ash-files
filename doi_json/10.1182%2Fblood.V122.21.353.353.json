    "abstract_text": "Background Despite the current risk-based stratification and therapies, up to 20% of pediatric patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) experience relapse. A major research effort is dedicated to identifying poor prognostic subgroups in the larger subset of patients with intermediate-risk disease, where most relapses occur. Recently, two groups in the US and the Netherlands independently identified a novel BCP-ALL subtype negative for the BCR/ABL fusion gene but with a gene-expression profile similar to Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) ALL. This \u2018 Ph-like \u2019 (or \u2018BCR/ABL-like ') subtype encompasses 10-15% of BCP-ALL patients, predicts high incidence of relapses and defines a candidate subgroup for targeted treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and alternative drugs. Aim Aim of this project was to identify BCP-ALL Ph-like cases and their prognosis in patients treated in Study Protocols of the Italian Association of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (AIEOP) Methods In the context of the Microarray Innovations in LEukemia (MILE) study, gene expression profiling was successfully performed on 400 Italian childhood BCP-ALL cases enrolled in AIEOP-BFM ALL2000/R2006 protocols, from whom material was available. The MILE classifier recognized the most common genetic subgroups, namely t(4;11), t(12;21), t(1;19) or t(9;22) positive, or high hyperdiploid (DNA index\u22651.16). Out of 400 BCP-ALL cases, 143 negative for common fusion transcripts, non-high hyperdiploid (DNA index<1.16) and non-Down Syndrome, were defined as \u2018B-others\u2019. Results Using signatures of known ALL subgroups, the likelihood to be close to one of the \u2018known\u2019 classes was defined for each of the B-others samples. Specifically, 43 B-other cases (43/143=30.1%, about 10% of total BCP-ALL cohort) presented as a cluster with a gene expression signature close to the BCR/ABL signature, therefore referred to as \u2018Ph-like\u2019. Among B-others, Ph-like cases had a significantly increased proportion of males, age>10 years and WBC>20x10 9 /L. The 5y event-free survival (EFS) of Ph-like patients was 54.8% (SE 8.2) vs 83.1% (3.9) in the remaining B-others patients (p<0.001), mostly due to an increased cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR: 33.9% (7.4) vs 14.9% (3.7); p=0.009). Notably, Ph-like patients did not differ for prednisone (PDN) and minimal residual disease (MRD) response or final risk stratification. Indeed, out of 36/43 stratified by MRD, only 7 patients had high-risk MRD, while 20 were MRD intermediate and 9 even MRD standard risk. Only 3 non-HR cases by MRD were then classified as HR based on PDN response. Of relevance, the significant difference in 5y EFS was confirmed in the 33 Ph-like patients with no HR features (59.8% (9.2) vs 88.5% (3.9) in the remaining B-others patients with similar features (p<0.001), with a significantly increased CIR (32.1% (8.4) vs 10.2% (3.7); p=0.005). Among 43 Ph-like cases, 1 was resistant and 1 died during the induction phase. Out of the 14 relapses, 10 were isolated medullary, and 4 combined with an extramedullary site (no CNS relapses). Two patients died in remission and no secondary malignancies occurred during the observation period. Overall, 25/43 (58.1%) Ph-like patients are alive in complete remission versus 84/100 (84.0%) in B-others, non Ph-like patients. Conclusions and perspectives We identified a \u2018Ph-like\u2019 subgroup in the Italian cohort of children with BCP-ALL, associated to a poor outcome. Ph-like patients, independently of the other known risk features, could be considered eligible for alternative treatments. The genetic characterization of this subgroup is ongoing within the AIEOP-BFM research trial cooperative group, which is aimed at further defining the pathogenetic mechanisms and identifying the therapeutic translation.
