    "abstract_text": "Abstract 157 S ignal T ransducer and A ctivator of T ranscription 3 (STAT3) serves as a transcription factor activated by cytokine-induced intracellular signals, which are critical in megakaryopoiesis. This signaling pathway may also be active in anucleated platelets that are primed by proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting that STAT3 plays a role in platelet hyperactivity associated with inflammation. We have recently found that three different classes of STAT3 inhibitors each selectively inhibited collagen-induced aggregation of human platelets by \u223c50%. They also blocked thrombus formation (\u223c80%) on immobilized collagen under an arterial shear stress of 62.5 dyn/cm 2 . These STAT3 inhibitors also blocked platelet aggregation induced by collagen-related peptide, suggesting that they acted on GP VI-mediated intracellular signaling in platelets. These in vitro results were further verified in two sets of experiments in mouse models. First, an oligonucleotide G-quartet STAT3 inhibitor (1 mg/ml) or a scrambled control oligonucleotide were infused into C57/BJ6 mice daily for three days. Collagen-induced platelet aggregation was then induced and found to be reduced by up to 60% in mice infused with the STAT3 inhibitor, but not with the control oligonucleotide. Photochemical injury-induced thrombosis in the cremaster arterioles was also significantly delayed in the inhibitor-infused mice as compared to control mice. Second, infusing STAT3 inhibitor could result in platelet inhibitor indirectly by acting endothelial cells. To address this concern, we have generated platelet-specific STAT3 null mice that have developed normally and have normal platelet counts. The collagen-, but not TRAP-induced platelet aggregation in the platelet STAT3 KO mice was reduced as compared to their littermates. Platelets from the platelet-specific STAT3 KO mice were also significantly defective in thrombus formation on immobilized collagen under 62.5 dyn/cm 2 of fluid shear stress that was generated in a parallel-plate flow chamber system. Consistent with results from these functional assays, collagen induced rapid (peaked at 5 min after stimulation) and dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, but not of STAT1 or STAT5 in washed human platelets. The phosphorylation was blocked dose-dependently by two STAT3 inhibitors. Syk inhibitors also blocked collagen-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, but STAT3 inhibitors had no effect on Syk phosphorylation, suggesting that Syk acts upstream of STAT3. Furthermore, STAT3 inhibitors also dose-dependently reduced collagen-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC\u03b32, which is a known substrate of Syk. Consistent with this temporal interaction among STAT3, Syk and PLC\u03b32, activated STAT3 co-immunoprecipitated phosphorylated Syk and PLC\u03b32 in collagen-activated human platelets. The tri-molecular complex was also immunoprecipitated by an antibody to PLC\u03b32. Taken together, these data suggest that STAT3 regulates collagen-induced platelet aggregation, independent of its transcription factor activity. The regulation is potentially achieved by STAT3 serving as a protein scaffold linking the kinase Syk with its substrate PLC\u03b32 to enhance the signal relay in collagen-activated platelets. This cross-talk between collagen and cytokine signaling pathways provides a mechanism for how proinflammatory mediators could prime platelets for activation by hemostatic ligands.
