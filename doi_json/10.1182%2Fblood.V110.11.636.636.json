    "abstract_text": "Background: Distress is an unpleasant psychosocial response that may impede the capacity of patients to cope successfully with a disease, its physical symptoms, and its treatment. Measurements of distress have been extensively evaluated in patients with solid tumor malignancies. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has recommend standards of care for distress management. However the degree of distress in patients with hematologic diseases (both malignant and non-malignant) is under-investigated. Aim: This study was designed to assess and compare distress in patients with malignant or non-malignant hematological disorders. Methods: Of 617 adult hematology patients enrolled between July 2006 and December 2006, 572 reported distress scores and were prospectively followed, while 45 patients who did not rate their distress were excluded. The NCCN Distress Thermometer (scale of 0\u201310) accompanied by a modified problem checklist was administered to hematology patients 18 years of age and older seen at the Gundersen Lutheran Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders. Additional demographics, diagnoses, and disease-related information were gathered by chart review. Patients reporting a high score were contacted by a social worker to assess the etiology of distress. Results: At initial visit during the study period, 572 patients reported a distress score (mean = 3.4 \u00b1 2.7). Patients with malignant (3.2 \u00b1 2.7) or non-malignant (3.6 \u00b1 2.6) disease reported similar distress (p = 0.125). Females (4.0 \u00b1 2.8) were more distressed than males (2.9 \u00b1 2.4; p < 0.001). Other factors significantly associated with distress were history of anxiety (p < 0.001), depression (p < 0.001), younger age (p = 0.001), and time from diagnosis (visit day 3.6 \u00b1 2.4; 1\u201390 days 4.2 \u00b1 2.9; 3mo-1 year 2.9 \u00b1 2.6; 1+ years 3.4 \u00b1 2.7; p = 0.028). Distress based on disease status was (relapse 5.0 \u00b1 3.1, remission/stable 3.3 \u00b1 2.6, treatment 3.7 \u00b1 2.7) also significantly different (p = 0.009). Conclusion : We found no significant difference in levels of reported distress between patients with malignant and non-malignant hematologic disorders. Significantly higher distress levels were reported in women, younger patients, those with previous psychiatric disease, date of visit, and those at relapse. Patients with either malignant or non-malignant hematologic disorders should be considered for distress screening and management.",
