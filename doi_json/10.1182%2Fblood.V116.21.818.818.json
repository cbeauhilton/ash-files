    "abstract_text": "Abstract 818 Fibrinolysis, a physiological process leading to clot resorbtion, is strictly controlled by fibrin-localized plasminogen activators (tPA and uPA) and by inhibitors like plasminogen activator type-1 (PAI-1). The serpin PAI-1 is a plasmatic serine protease inhibitor, that is also stored in platelets \u03b1-granules. PAI-1 inhibits both the action of urokinase- and tissue-type plasminogen activators (uPA and tPA respectively), and is up to now considered as the principal inhibitor of fibrinolysis in vivo . Interestingly, platelets are also known to inhibit fibrinolysis by both PAI-1-dependent and PAI-1-independent mechanisms. The individual role of other serpins, specifically protease nexin-1 (PN-1) in the thrombolytic process has not been investigated so far. Indeed, we recently demonstrated that a significant amount of PN-1 is stored within the \u03b1-granules of platelets and plays an antithrombotic function in vivo . PN-1, also known as SERPINE2, deserves a special interest since it also significantly inhibits in vitro uPA, tPA and plasmin. In this study, we explored the effect of PN-1 on fibrinolysis in vitro and in vivo . We evidenced the antifibrinolytic activity of platelet PN-1 in vitro using a specific PN-1-blocking antibody and PN-1 deficient platelets and, in vivo in PN-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Our data directly indicate that platelet PN-1 inhibits both tPA and plasmin activities in fibrin zymography. Remarkably, whereas fibrin-bound tPA or plasmin activity is not affected by PAI-1, we showed that PN-1 inhibits both plasmin generation induced by tPA-bound to fibrin and fibrin-bound plasmin. Moreover, PN-1 blockade or PN-1 deficiency result in an increased lysis of fibrin clots generated from platelet-rich plasma indicating that PN-1 regulates endogenous tPA-mediated lysis. Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM \u00ae ) analysis shows that platelet PN-1 significantly decreases the rate of fibrinolysis ex vivo. Futhermore, blockade or deficiency of PN-1 provides direct evidence for an acceleration of the lysis-front velocity in platelet-rich clots. To challenge the role of PN-1 on fibrinolysis in vivo, we have developed an original murine model of thrombolysis. Using a dorsal skinfold chamber, thrombus formation induced by ferric chloride injury of venules and subsequent thrombolysis were visualized by microscopy on alive animals. This new approach allows a reproducible quantification of thrombus formation and of tPA- induced thrombus lysis. We observed that thrombi are more readily lysed in PN-1-deficient mice than in wild-type mice. Moreover, in PN-1 deficient mice, the rate and the extent of reperfusion were both increased ( Figure A and B). These data demonstrate that platelet PN-1 is a new negative regulator of thrombolysis activity of plasmin, both in solution and within the clot. For the first time, this study shows that PN-1 protects towards thrombolysis and therefore could give rise to new approaches for therapeutic application. Indeed, PN-1 might be a promising target for optimizing thrombolytic therapy by tPA. Figure : View large Download slide Effect of PN-1 on thrombolysis.
