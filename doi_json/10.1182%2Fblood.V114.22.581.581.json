    "abstract_text": "Abstract 581 Patients with iAMP21 (intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21) represent a distinct cytogenetic subgroup of childhood B cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL; incidence \u223c2%) with a poor prognosis on standard therapy (29% EFS at 5 years). From cytogenetic studies the amplification of chromosome 21 appears to be the primary genetic change, however, whether this or associated abnormalities provide the initiating event of leukaemogenesis remains to be elucidated. Currently fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) with probes directed to the RUNX1 gene provides the only reliable detection method. Knowledge of the underlying genetic mechanism will lead to improved diagnosis and determine those patients at high risk of relapse who require more intensive therapy. Our previous study using genomic arrays (1Mb aCGH, n=10; NimbleGen chromosome 21 custom oligonucleotide array, n=5) identified a common region of amplification (CRA) on 21q of 6.6 Mb and a common region of deletion (CRD) of 3.3 Mb within the telomeric region in 100% and 70% of patients, respectively. However, expression profiling (Affymetrix U133A, n=8) indicated that no important genes within the CRA or CRD were differentially expressed. We now have clinical, cytogenetic and FISH data on 94 iAMP21 patients (44 F, 50 M; median age 9.5y, range 2-30); the largest iAMP21 cohort investigated to date. Higher resolution analysis of 17/94 diagnostic samples by aCGH (Agilent 185K platform) have refined these regions to 5.1 Mb and 2.5 Mb in 100% and 88% of patients, respectively. Recent genome mapping has highlighted the presence of the microRNA miR-802 within the CRA and shown this region overlaps with the Down Syndrome Critical Region at 21q22.3 encompassing the genes DSCR1 , DSCR3 and DYRK1 . Detailed analysis of chromosome 21 identified recurrent breakpoints centromeric of the CRD within three genes: PDE9A (n=2), COL6A2 (n=2) and DSCAM (n=2). The role of these genes in the initiation of the chromosomal instability associated with iAMP21 is currently under investigation. Global analysis of the iAMP21 genome identified an average of 13 copy number alterations (CNA) per case with recurrent deletions of the leukaemia associated genes PAX5 (n=2), IKZF1 (n=4) and CDKN2A (n=4). To determine the incidences of PAX5 , IKZF1 and CDKN2A deletions among the cohort of 94 iAMP21 patients, FISH using probes targeting these genes was carried out on availabel samples. IKZF1 (exons 3-6) was deleted at the highest incidence of 21% (13/62), while CDKN2A and PAX5 were deleted at a lower incidence of 17% (12/71) and 8% (4/48), respectively. The high incidence of IKZF1 deletions found in this patient group correlates with their association with high risk ALL. We have recently reported a deletion within the PAR1 region of the sex chromosomes, centromeric of the CRLF2 gene involving CSF2RA and IL3RA , which leads to deregulated expression of CRLF2 . This deletion occurred at an incidence of 23% (17/73), as determined by FISH. Among pairs of matched diagnostic and relapse samples; one had this deletion at both diagnosis and relapse while the second had a deletion in the diagnostic sample only. Gain of an additional \u00d7 chromosome was identified in 28% (18/65). Of note is that the 3 aberrations: abnormalities of chromosome 21, gain of the \u00d7 chromosome and high incidence of deletions centromeric of CRLF2 in this patient group mirror the findings in Down Syndrome (DS) ALL, although we have not identified any mutations of the JAK2 kinase domain among this cohort of iAMP21 patients to date. This genome-wide study provides further support for the proposal that amplification of genes within the CRA on chromosome 21 is the primary event driving leukaemogenesis in iAMP21 patients. It has also highlighted that the 3 abnormalities in common with DS ALL and/or deletions of IKZF1, which all occur at a high incidence, contribute towards the progression of this high risk subtype of childhood BCP-ALL.
