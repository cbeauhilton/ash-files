    "abstract_text": "Recent findings suggest that in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) several key regulatory genes are affected by aberrant promotor methylation. To explore the molecular basis of this impairment we have generated an in vitro model of MDS lineage-specific hematopoietic differentiation by culturing CD34+ cells from healthy donors (n=7) and MDS patients (low risk: RA/n=6, RARS/n=3; high risk: RAEB/n=4, RAEB-T/n=2) with EPO, TPO and GCSF. Cell harvest was at days 0, 4, 7 and 11. Promotor methylation analysis of key genes involved in the control of apoptosis (p73, survivin, DAPK), DNA-repair (hMLH1), differentiation (RARb, WT1) and cell cycle control (p14, p15, p16, CHK2) was performed by methylation specific PCR of bisulfite treated genomic DNA for each lineage at each time point. In addition, expression of DNMT1 (maintenance DNA methyltransferase), DNMT3a and DNMT3b (both de novo DNA methyltransferase) was analyzed by real time RT-PCR and correlated with gene promotor methylation at any time point. DNMT1 expression was increased during erythropoiesis in both, normal controls and MDS patients. On the other hand, expression of de novo DNMTs was elevated during thrombopoiesis at all time points. During erythropoiesis hypermethylation of p73, hMLH1 and RARb was associated with elevated DNMT1, hypermethylation of p15, p16, p73 and survivin was positively associated with increasing DNMT3 expression. Interestingly, DNMT1 was only elevated in low risk MDS, but not further increased in high risk MDS patients. Surprisingly, MDS specific survivin promotor methylation was inverse correlated with DNTM1 and DNMT3a expression. However, a negative correlation of DNMT3a with survivin expression was found in low risk MDS but not in high risk MDS. In summary our data indicate that all mammalian DNMT isoforms may be involved in the aberrant DNA-methylation phenotype in MDS. Elevated DNMT1 expression may in particular contribute to ineffective erythropoiesis in low risk MDS. DNMT3a and 3b were elevated during megakaryopoiesis and their expression was inversely correlated with MDS disease risk (IPSS). We conclude that the knowledge about distinct expression patterns of DNMT isoforms in hematopoiesis may be of help for further strategies to implicate DNMT-inhibitors in the treatment of patients with MDS."
