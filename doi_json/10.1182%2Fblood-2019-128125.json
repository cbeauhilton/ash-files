    "abstract_text": "Background : Risk of bleeding post dental extractions in patients on the anticoagulant medication is not well-established. The aim of the study is to investigate the incidence of postoperative bleeding following dental extractions in adult patients on antithrombotic medication in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A retrospective study of 539 patients aged 18 to 93 years of age, attended 840 visits for dental extractions from January 2012 to June 2016 at a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia. All returning patients were treated as outpatients with local hemostatic measures. Results: Only 1.7% of the visits were associated with post-operative bleeding following dental extractions. The highest risk of bleeding occurred in patients on Warfarin (3.88%), while those on Clopidogrel had no risk associated with bleeding. Women were found to have the highest rate of bleeding associated with dental extractions especially those on new oral anticoagulant medications. Conclusion: Dental extractions can be safely performed on adults receiving antithrombotic treatment provided established guidelines are followed. Health care professionals must exercise caution when planning invasive dental treatment for patients on continued antithrombotic therapy. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
