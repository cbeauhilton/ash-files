    "abstract_text": "NK Cell subpopulations express tremendous diversity through polymorphisms, haplotypes, differential expression, and licensing of the Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR). KIR diversity affects both the predisposition to cancer, and the response to therapies such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Clinical trials that take advantage of the anti-cancer properties of NK cells have been limited to choosing donors on the basis of KIR genotypes and/or HLA haplotypes. Moreover, adoptive immunotherapy approaches have been limited by low NK cell doses. The latter hurdle has been recently mitigated by methods for expanding clinical grade NK cells ex vivo . These approaches for growing large numbers of cells now enable investigation into selecting more potent NK cell subsets for increased therapeutic efficacy. We hypothesized that the desired KIR repertoire could be molded through inhibition of undesirable KIR populations by crosslinking with relevant anti-KIR antibodies during expansion with our previously described method, which produces a mean 30,000-fold expansion of NK cells in 3 weeks. First, we determined that maximum inhibition was obtained when anti-KIR antibodies were applied to previously activated NK cells, crosslinked with secondary antibody, and then restimulated for proliferation. Robust reduction of targeted KIR-positive populations could be achieved for each inhibitory KIR (Fig. 1). When pre-activated with anti-KIR2DL1 for one stimulation cycle, NK cells expressing this KIR were decreased by a median of 70.4% \u00b1 19.3%. Similarly, KIR2DL2/3+ NK cells could be reduced by 56% \u00b1 17.5%, and KIR3DL1+ NK cells could be reduced by 53.5% \u00b1 16.3%. When anti-KIR antibodies were combined, similar suppression of multiple-KIR subpopulations was observed. Other NK cell receptors were not significantly affected during targeted KIR inhibition. We then assessed the resulting NK cell populations for degranulation responses to targets with selected HLA as KIR ligands. Inhibition of KIR-expressing subpopulations during expansion resulted in NK cell populations with enhanced degranulation against tumor cells expressing the HLA ligand of the targeted KIR. Importantly, the cytotoxicity of the bulk NK cell population against HLA-negative targets remained. These results indicate that KIR crosslinking during NK cell propagation enables significant reduction in the targeted KIR subpopulations, resulting in an NK cell population with a selective decrease in KIR inhibition. By utilizing antibody-controlled expansion for molding of the KIR repertoire according to patient HLA type, a personalized NK cell product may be produced with enhanced potency, improving NK cell immunotherapy.
