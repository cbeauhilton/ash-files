    "abstract_text": "Cancer cells have altered energy demand due to their increased proliferative capacity. In Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM), an indolent yet incurable B-cell lymphoma, the homeostasis of the bone marrow (BM) environment is disturbed due to the infiltration of the lymphoplamacytic cells that continuously produce monoclonal IgM. An alteration in energy demand could skew the balance of key proteins and metabolites towards a permissive niche for WM tumor cells growth, and unfavorably effect on the immune response against tumor cells. Therefore, the aim of our study was to identify how changes in certain metabolites and/or proteins could contribute to the pathobiology of WM and whether the cytokine and chemokine composition of the BM microenvironment play a role in such changes. WM patient's samples including BM plasma, peripheral blood serum and BM cells (n=101) as well as equivalent normal counterparts (n=86) were collected and used for metabolomics analysis. Comprehensive targeted metabolomics analysis was performed using Capillary Electrophoresis Time-of-Flight Mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS), CE-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (CE-qQqMS) and Liquid Chromatography (LC-TOFMS). Normal and WM peripheral blood serums samples were also used for untargeted proteomics analysis using a fully automated proteomic technology platform that includes an Agilent 1200 Series Quaternary HPLC system connected to a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer. Real-time PCR analysis was performed to detect the gene expression of the relevant metabolite transporters located on the cell membrane. BM cells from control and WM patients' samples were used for flow cytometry analysis. IHC was used to detect the proteins on the BM tissues. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchal Clustering Analysis (HCA) on both metabolomics and proteomics data identified two distinct clusters for disease and normal samples, indicating that there are differentially expressed proteins and metabolites in WM versus normal samples. Furthermore, pathway analysis showed that the majority of the altered metabolites were the members of the glutathione (GSH) metabolism pathway. This finding was further validated not only by data obtained from metabolomics analysis of BM cells and BM plasma, but also by proteomic data WM patients serum, implying that GSH metabolism is key to the biology of WM. Moreover, stimulation of WM cell lines by IL-6 and IL-21, cytokines involved in inducing WM cell proliferation and IgM secretion, resulted in increased gene expression of the transporters mediating uptake of metabolites required for GSH synthesis, including SLC7A11, 4F2HC and LAT1, indicating that cytokines in the WM BM could modulate GSH metabolism. In addition, IHC staining of the BM tissues as well as flow cytometry analysis of patients' lymphoplasmacytic cells identified glutathione peroxidase as one of the major proteins modulating GSH metabolism in WM. In summary, our data highlight a central role for GSH metabolism in WM disease biology and indicate that intervening with the metabolic processes could be a potential therapeutic strategy for patients with WM.
