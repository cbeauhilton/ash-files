    "abstract_text": "When released from cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, Granzyme (Gzm) serine proteases induce programmed cell death of pathogen-infected cells and tumor cells. The Gzms rapidly accumulate in the target cell nucleus by an unknown mechanism. Many of the known substrates of GzmA and GzmB, the most abundant killer cell proteases, bind to DNA or RNA. Gzm substrates predicted by unbiased proteomics studies are also highly enriched for nucleic acid binding proteins. Here we show by fluorescence polarization assays that Gzms bind DNA and RNA with nanomolar affinity. We hypothesized that Gzm binding to nucleic acids enhances nuclear accumulation in target cells and facilitates their cleavage of nucleic acid-binding substrates. In fact, RNase treatment of cell lysates reduced cleavage of RNA binding protein (RBP) targets by GzmA and GzmB. Moreover, adding RNA to recombinant RBP substrates greatly enhanced in vitro cleavage by GzmB, but adding RNA to non-nucleic acid binding proteins did not. For example, exogenous RNA enhanced GzmB cleavage of recombinant hnRNP C1 (an RBP) but not LMNB1 (a non-RBP). In addition, GzmB cleaved the RNA-binding HuR protein efficiently only when it was bound to an HuR-binding RNA oligonucleotide, but not in the presence of an equal amount of non-binding RNA. Thus, nucleic acids facilitate Gzm cleavage of nucleic acid binding substrates. To evaluate whether nucleic acid binding influences Gzm trafficking in target cells, we incubated fixed target cells with RNase and then added Gzms. RNA degradation in target cells reduced Gzm cytosolic localization and increased nuclear accumulation. Similarly, pre-incubating Gzms with exogenous competitor DNA reduced Gzm nuclear localization. The Gzms form a monophyletic clade with other immune serine proteases including neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G (CATG). Upon neutrophil activation, NE translocates to the nucleus to drive the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NE and CATG, but not non-immune serine proteases such as trypsin and pancreatic elastase, also bind DNA with high affinity and localize to the nucleus of permeabilized cells. Consistent with this finding, competitor DNA also blocks the nuclear localization of NE. Moreover NE and CATG localization to NETs depends on DNA binding. Thus the antimicrobial activity of NETs may depend in part upon the affinity of these proteases for DNA. Our findings indicate that high affinity nucleic acid binding is a conserved and functionally important property of serine proteases involved in cell-mediated immunity.
