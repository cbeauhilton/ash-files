    "abstract_text": "Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is a common complication of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), especially patients with \u03b2-thalassemia major (TM). To estimate whether incidence of VOD recently decreased after using NF-08-TM protocol (NP), 311 TM-HCTs performed from February 2003 to June 2013 were analyzed. 241 patients received NP in or after 2009 and 70 received non-NP before 2009. VOD was diagnosed by Seattle criteria (SC) or Baltimore Criteria (BC). Patients were stratified by Nanfang (NF) criteria. A total of 31(10.0%) and 14 (4.5%) HCTs developed VOD (6 and 5 developed severe VOD) in SC and BC cohorts, respectively. The incidence of VOD was significantly lower in NP versus non-NP groups and in Class 2 versus Class 3 groups. Overall survival was significantly higher in NP versus non-NP cohorts. Rate of VOD in alternative donor transplant (ADT) was similar to that in matched sibling transplant (MST). Requirement of platelet and value of D-dimer significantly increased in the VOD patients. Our study showed the incidence of VOD significantly decreased in our center after using NP. ADT was similar to MST on rate of VOD. NF criteria of stratification can indicate occurrence of VOD. The SC can be more suitable criteria for early diagnosis. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
