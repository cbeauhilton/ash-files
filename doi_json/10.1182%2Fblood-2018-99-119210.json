    "abstract_text": "The AF10/MLLT10 gene is recurrently involved in chromosomal rearrangements in human leukemia. AF10 rearrangements are linked to a poor prognosis in AML and T-ALL, underscoring the need to identify targeted therapies for AF10-fusion positive leukemia. Defining the molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis mediated by AF10-fusion proteins (AF10-FPs) may unravel novel actionable targets in leukemias with AF10-gene rearrangements. Towards this end, we established tetracycline (Tet)-inducible models of MLL-AF10 and CALM-AF10 AML and performed RNA-seq in AML cells treated with doxycycline (Dox) compared to vehicle treated counterparts. Since Dox treatment completely abrogates AF10-fusion gene expression from the Tet-regulated promoter, these models can be used to characterize the transcriptional landscape of potential AF10-FP target genes. We observed that among transcripts significantly downregulated upon Dox treatment, 168 genes were common in both the MLL-AF10 Tet-Off or CALM-AF10 Tet-Off conditions, indicating a high overlap between potential transcriptional targets of these distinct AF10-FPs. Expectedly, this list included genes previously implicated in leukemogenesis including Hoxa cluster genes, Meis1, Flt3 , Mecom , Cd34 , Gfi1b , Eya1 and Nkx2-3 . Importantly, in addition to these well-characterized genes, we identified a number of novel pathways that were downregulated in the AF10-FP Tet-Off state. The most striking molecular signature of potential AF10-FP-regulated genes emerging from these analyses were factors involved in innate immunity and pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling. Prominent drivers of these molecular signatures included genes of the Jak/Stat and NFkB signaling pathways as well as Interferon response genes. We confirmed that AF10-FPs strongly activated Jak-Stat and NFkB signaling by performing Western blotting for key factors involved in these pathways. Since pro-inflammatory cytokines have been shown to play a role in AML cell survival, we tested the impact of cytokine depletion on murine AF10-FPs-driven AML cells. Proliferation assays demonstrated that AF10-FP-transformed cells could survive significantly better in cytokine-free medium compared to those transformed with other oncogenes such as MLL-AF9, which were completely dependent on cytokines for survival and proliferation in vitro . These results suggest that activation of cytokine signaling may contribute to increased survival of AF10-FP-driven AML cells. Next, we performed proteomic studies in which affinity-purified epitope-tagged AF10-FPs were evaluated for interacting proteins using Mass Spectrometry (MS). While studies on MLL-AF10 fusion are ongoing, our studies revealed that the strongest interactor of the CALM-AF10 fusion protein was the Janus kinase protein Jak1. We confirmed this finding by immunoprecipitation experiments in CALM-AF10 AML cells using a Jak1-specific antibody. Given the role of JAK1 in cytokine-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling, our findings indicate that CALM-AF10 may activate this pathway through direct recruitment of the Jak1 kinase. We sought to directly test the role of JAK1 in AF10-FP-mediated leukemogenesis. For this, we transformed bone marrow stem and progenitor cells from Jak1 floxed mice with the CALM-AF10 fusion. Deletion of Jak1 using Cre-recombinase in CALM-AF10 AML significantly reduced their proliferation in vitro . Furthermore, Jak1 deletion led to a highly significant reduction in the number of colony forming units (CFUs) from CALM-AF10 AML cells, with a particularly striking decrease in the number of blast-like colonies. We also observed a significant increase in differentiation of CALM-AF10 AML cells following Jak1 deletion, demonstrating that Jak1 activity is important for maintaining the CALM-AF10 leukemia cells in an undifferentiated state. Importantly, these results were recapitulated with two different small-molecule JAK1 inhibitors itacitinib and filgotinib that are being tested in clinical trials for a variety of human diseases. Treatment of CALM-AF10 AML cells with these selective JAK1 inhibitors led to a significant, dose-dependent decrease in proliferation accompanied by growth arrest and apoptosis. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that AF10 fusions activate pro-inflammatory signaling by co-opting the Jak-Stat pathway, presenting a potential therapeutic target in AF10-fusion-driven AML.
