    "abstract_text": "We previously demonstrated that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3\u03b2 (Stat3\u03b2) acts as a negative regulator of \u03b3-globin gene expression. We speculate that Stat3\u03b2 participates in the \u03b3 to \u03b2-globin switch recapitulated during erythroid maturation. Regulatory elements located between nucleotide \u221252 and +36 relative to the \u03b3-globin cap site may define a silencing domain where Stat3\u03b2 exerts its negative effect. We analyzed DNA-protein interactions in a putative Stat3 binding site at +9\u03b3 and an overlapping Stat3/GATA-1 consensus sequence at +26\u03b3. The +9\u03b3 motif was required for Stat3\u03b2 mediated \u03b3-gene silencing in K562 cells and normal erythroid progenitors. Mutating the +26\u03b3 site disrupted both Stat3 and GATA-1 binding which was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. We demonstrated for the first time direct interaction between Stat3 and GATA-1 using immunoprecipitation techniques and protein extracts isolated from K562 and mouse erythroleukemia cells. We speculate that developmental stage specific DNA-protein interactions in the \u221252 to +36 region are required for \u03b3-gene silencing. To investigate this hypothesis, we tested the ability of Stat3\u03b2 to bind in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. K562 cells were treated with Interleukin-6 (100ng/ml) to activate Stat3\u03b2 and then used for ChIP analysis with phosphorylated-Stat3\u03b2 antibody. Specific PCR primers were designed to amplify the region between nucleotide \u221252 and +36 relative to the \u03b3-globin cap site. We observed increased Stat3\u03b2 binding to the \u03b3-globin silencing domain in vivo after Interleukin-6 treatment. To compliment this approach, we modified our ChIP assay as follows. A trypsin digest step was added after cross-linking proteins to the \u03b3-globin silencing domain in vitro . The samples will be analyzed by nanospray LC/MS/MS mass spectrometry to characterize the transcription factors that bind the silencing domain and interact with Stat3\u03b2 in this region. Understanding the DNA-protein interactions required for \u03b3-globin regulation will provide insights into mechanisms for globin gene silencing.",
