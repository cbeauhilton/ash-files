    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4050 The role of the telomeres in the mechanisms of ageing and carcinogenesis has generated a considerable interest as a novel approach to the treatment of many cancers. Telomeres are nucleoproteins structures that protect the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, which are particularly vulnerable due to progressive shortening in almost all dividing cells. The telomere length was observed as a critical factor in the initiation and progression of human cancers, and it is associated to chromosomal instability. Most immortal cells possess enzymatic activity of telomerase. This suggests that telomerase activity and telomere length maintenance may be required for unlimited cell proliferation, tumorigenesis, and protection, allowing the evasion of apoptosis in cancer development. The telomerase activity could also be regulated positively or negatively by post-trancriptional and/or post-translational modification of the enzyme without transcriptional up-regulation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) mRNA. In this work, we analyze the expression data of all genes involved in telomerase activity. Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), multiple myeloma (MM) and plasma cell leukemia (PLC) were studied through gene expression profiling analysis (Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays, Affymetrix). We identify 21 deregulated genes, implicated directly in telomere length maintenance activity in clonal plasma cells compared with normal cells (20 up-regulated and 1 down-regulated). These genes are MYC , KRAS , HSPA9 , RB1 and members of the families: Small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (H/ACA snoRNPs), A/B subfamily of ubiquitously expressed heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), and 14-3 -3 family. In conclusion, the myeloma cells acquire the telomere maintenance capability without deregulation of the human telomerase RNA gene (hTERC) and hTERT gene expression. It is an alternative lengthening of telomeres mechanism that has effect in the regulation of the BAD activity in apoptosis. The mechanism is based on preventing the partially-denatured proteins from aggregating, telomere maintenance through the correct processing and intranuclear trafficking of hTERC, telomerase reactivation and telomere stabilization, and efficient accumulation of hTERT in the nucleus. Thus, the findings of this study may help to improve telomerase-based therapy for multiple myeloma. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
