    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1835 Poster Board I-861 Five studies demonstrated the superiority of MPT over MP regimen in elderly patients with MM not eligible for transplantation. In particular, one of these studies, showed this figure in patients aged more than 75 years who represent more than one third of MM patients. Nevertheless, in this latter study 42.5% of patients withdrawn from the MPT protocol because of toxicity. Therefore, there is a wide room of improving these results in this troublesome patient population. Using ThaDD regimen, including liposomal pegylated doxorubicin, we reported low haematological and non-hematological toxicity in elderly and",
