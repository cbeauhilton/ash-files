    "abstract_text": "X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) is characterized by profound immunodeficiency (dysfunctional B cells; absence of T and NK cells) and early mortality, caused by mutations in the IL2RG gene encoding the common gamma chain (\u03b3c) of receptors for interleukins (IL)-2,-4,-7,-9,-15 and -21. The standard therapy for XSCID in infants is a T cell depleted bone marrow transplant with either none or very modest conditioning. While 5-yr survival is >95% with HLA-matched sibling donors, most patients receive a haploidentical graft from a parent, resulting in lower survival and less robust immune reconstitution that may be limited to only the T cell lineage. Ex vivo autologous stem cell gene therapy has emerged as an alternate treatment capable of achieving substantial to complete immune reconstitution in infants without a sibling donor. However, some children have developed lymphocytic leukemia, which appears in part to be related to vector insertional mutagenesis. The gammaretroviruses currently in use have potent enhancers in the LTR and have a predilection to insert at the 5\u2032 end of genes. Self-inactivating (SIN) lentivirus vectors may be advantageous because they do not show this property and can be constructed with internal promotors that have less enhancer activity together with insertion of insulators. We have constructed SIN simian immunodeficiency viral vectors (SIV mac ) encoding human \u03b3c (h\u03b3c), with or without a double copy chicken insulator core element in the 3\u2032 LTR. In addition we have pseudotyped the vector with a chimeric RD114 envelope to enhance targeting of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and avoid the cytotoxicity of the VSV-G envelope traditionally used with lentivectors. We have previously shown that it is possible to correct a dog model of XSCID using a RD114-pseudotyped gammaretroviral vector encoding the dog \u03b3c for in vivo gene therapy. Unlike the mouse model of XSCID which lacks B cells, the dog model more closely resembles the phenotype in humans. We decided to use our in vivo dog model for preclinical testing of safety and efficacy of our SIV h\u03b3c vectors. Viral particles were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells with a 4-plasmid system and concentrated by high-speed centrifugation. 30 mls (average 2.4\u20133\u00d710 7 viral particles in total) was injected IV into 2\u20135 day-old pups. Transgene marking in blood lymphocytes was detected as early as 2 wks after treatment, increased within the first 6\u20138 wks and became relatively stable thereafter. The absolute lymphocyte count was normalized in one dog (injected on the second day after birth) by wk 6 (4000, 76% h\u03b3c + ), and improved in two other dogs (422, 29% h\u03b3c + at 18 wks; 498, 27% h\u03b3c + , at 16 wks) which had received the same amount of virus over 2 days. Furthermore, up to 5% of the myeloid lineage showed gene marking at 10\u201318 wks after viral delivery, indicating that early committed progenitors or HSCs had been transduced. It is noteworthy that our finding that the h\u03b3c can improve the disease phenotype in XSCID dogs makes it an excellent large animal model for preclinical evaluation of vectors. In summary, we have demonstrated that in vivo delivery of SIV lentiviral vectors expressing h\u03b3c efficiently reconstitute the T-lymphoid compartment in the XSCID canine model. We plan to monitor these dogs closely for potential adverse events."
