    "abstract_text": "DN, YZ, AS, & JL contributed equally, as did MF, TW, & BSC The \u03b1IIb\u03b23 antagonist antiplatelet drug abciximab, approved in 1994, is the chimeric antigen-binding fragment (Fab) comprising the variable regions of murine mAb 7E3 and human IgG1 and light chain \u03ba constant domains. In studies involving thousands of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions, abciximab decreased mortality and the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction. Mutagenesis studies conducted by us and others (Puzon-McLaughlin, JBC 2000; Takagi, Biochem 2002; Artoni, PNAS 2004) suggested that abciximab binds to the \u03b23 C177-C184 specificity-determining loop (SDL) and Trp129 on the adjacent \u03b21-\u03b11 helix, and our negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) studies of the complex of mAb 7E3 with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in nanodiscs (Choi, Blood 2013) supported its binding to the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 head domain. None of these studies, however, had the resolution to assess whether 7E3 or abciximab prevents fibrinogen binding by steric interference, disruption of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23-binding pocket for fibrinogen, or both. To address this knowledge gap, we used cryo-EM to produce a density map at 2.8-\u00c5 resolution, which allowed us to build an atomic model of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23-abciximab complex. The interacting surface of abciximab is comprised of residues from all three complementarity determining regions of both the light and heavy chains, with high representation of aromatic residues (Figure). Abciximab buries a total of 1,273 \u00c5 2 of solvent-exposed surface on \u03b1IIb\u03b23, of which 1,040 \u00c5 2 is with \u03b23 and 218 \u00c5 2 is with \u03b1IIb. The binding of abciximab does not result in disruption of the ADMIDAS, MIDAS, or SyMBS metal ion regions, but it does produce an ~3.4 \u00c5 compression of the SDL. Binding is primarily to the \u03b23 SDL and neighboring residues, the \u03b21-\u03b11 helix, and \u03b23 Ser211-Val212 and Met335. The latter residue interacts with the ADMIDAS metal ion in the unliganded receptor; ligand binding leads to the loss of the interaction and a dramatic swing-out motion of the \u03b23 subunit that produces a high-affinity ligand-binding conformation. Surprisingly, the structure also indicated several abciximab interactions with \u03b1IIb. To assess the contribution of individual interactions between \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin and abciximab to the stability of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23-abciximab complex, we carried out 4 independent molecular dynamics simulations of the cryo-EM structure as well as the X-ray crystal structure of ligand-free \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin in its closed conformation (PDB: 3FCS). These revealed that the dynamic behavior of the RGD peptide-binding pocket was similar between the cryo-EM structure of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23-abciximab complex and the X-ray structure of unbound \u03b1IIb\u03b23 during the total simulation time of 2 microseconds per system. Abciximab-protein interaction analysis of the simulations demonstrated that: 1. The \u03b1IIb subunit participated marginally in the interaction with abciximab, with only the Asp159(\u03b1IIb)-Arg7(light chain) making contact for >0.5 fraction of the simulation time. 2. The \u03b23 residues with >0.7 contact fraction values were Lys125, Asp126, Trp129, and Gln132 on the \u03b21-\u03b11 helix; Glu171, Asn175, Tyr178, Lys181, Thr182, and Thr183 on the SDL; and Val212, Met335, and Asp336. We calculated the effect of every possible mutation at each residue involved in significant inter-molecular interaction with abciximab in terms of changes in free energy of binding, and the resulting relative values were compared to experimental mutagenesis data. Thus, we made \u03b1IIb Asp159Ala and \u03b23 Met335Asp mutations, the latter producing the analogous murine residue and the mutation predicted to be most disruptive to abciximab binding. We found no effect of either mutation on the binding of either mAb 7E3 or abciximab as judged by flow cytometry. Our data demonstrate unexpected interactions of abciximab with several \u03b1IIb residues and \u03b23 Met335. Most importantly, abciximab binding did not alter the atomic structure or dynamics of the RGD-binding pocket in the timescale of the simulation, and so unless it induces allosteric modulation over a longer time scale, it does not appear to disrupt the RGD-binding pocket. Abciximab did, however, compress the SDL, which is not a component of the RGD-binding pocket but contributes to ligand binding by a still undefined mechanism. Thus, our data are most consistent with abciximab preventing ligand binding by steric interference, with a potential contribution via alteration of the SDL.
