    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5004 Background: Interphase Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has improved the detection of early bad prognostic genomic aberrations in Myeloma (MM) is a fast and reliable method. We used this assay in myeloma patients at diagnosis, after relapse or treatment failure. Methods: Interphase Mononuclear cells from Bone Marrow of 36 Caucasian patients, 13 men and 23 women, age ranged from 40 to 84 years (median, 64) with MM. were analyzed by LEXEL Live FISH probes, for deletions in chromosome band 13q14. 3, 17p13. 1; IGH/CCND1 translocation dual fusion and cMYC breakapart 8 Chromosome. Results: Chromosomal aberrations were detected in 16 of 33 evaluable patient samples of a total 36 patients population. The most frequent aberrations were 7/16 in 13p14. 3 band deletion (43. 75%) 7/33 (21%); 5/16 (31, 25%)patients with deletion had 17p13. 15/33 (15, 15%); 3 cMYC breakapart 3/16 (18. 75%) 3/33 (9%); IGH/CCND1 translocation in 3 patients 3/16 (18. 75%) 3/33 (9%), two of them associated one with cMYC and the other with 13p14. 3. We found other association: A)13p14. 3; 17p13. 1 and cMYC in (1/33). B) 13p14. 3 and cMYC (1/33) C) 17p13. 1; cMYC (1/33). Two patients had 8 chromosome trisomy 2/33 (6%). We foun that 13p14. 3, 17p13. 1 and cMYC association was correlated with a worst and fast evolution. Who had 13p14. 3 band deletion had a worst evolution in our patients. cMyc was associated with a poor prognosis. Conclusions: Genomic aberrations are independent prognosis factors of disease progression, chemotherapy respond and survival in Myeloma. Novel DNA molecular target and bone marrow micro environment modification drugs such as bortezomib and thalidomide or lenalidomide must be use in first line associated perhaps with standar chemotherapy drugs for improving result and consolidate this patients with autologous bone marrow transplantation avoiding the dilate of this strategic in patient with poor prognosis. Future trials must be performed to include a more complete panel of probes in Myeloma. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
