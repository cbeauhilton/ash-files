    "abstract_text": "Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is distinguished from other AMLs by cytogenetic, clinical, as well as biological characteristics. The hallmark of APL is the t(15;17) which leads to the expression of the PML/RAR fusion protein. PML/RAR is the central leukemia-inducing lesion in APL and is directly targeted by all trans retinoic acid (t-RA). Patients suffering from APL undergo complete hematologic but not molecular remission upon treatment with t-RA. Virtually all patients treated with t-RA-monotherapy had a rapid relapse within few months. But in the combination with an anthracycline, such as doxorubicin or idarubicin, t-RA improved the long term outcome of APL-patients dramatically. Nothing is known about why t-RA-monotherapy is unable to eradicate completely the leukemic population and how it increases the response to chemotherapy. In vitro, the exposure of early hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to t-RA does not induce differentiation but selects immature progenitors. Moreover, mice lacking the t-RA-specific receptor RARalpha do not exhibit an impairment of granulopoiesis or hemopoiesis. The indication, that t-RA may be involved in the hemopoietic differentiation, is given by the HL-60 cell line which undergoes granulocytic differentiation at the pharmacological dosages (10 \u22126 M) of t-RA. Furthermore vitamin A-deficient mice or mice treated with a antagonist of t-RA accumulate more immature granulocytes in the bone marrow. PML/RAR mediates the response of APL blasts to t-RA, but it is completely unclear, which effect t-RA exerts on the PML/RAR-positive leukemic stem cells which maintains the blast population and represents the source of relapse. Therefore we investigated the effect of t-RA on a cell population with stem cell capacity expressing PML/RAR isolated from the APL cell line NB4 as well as from CD34+/CD38- KG-1 cells transfected with PML/RAR. Here we report that i) the NB4 cells engrafted in NOD/SCID mice indicating the presence of a subpopulation with stem cell capacity in NB4 cells; ii) NB4 had a Hoechst 3342 excluding side population (SP) representing about 1% of the whole cell population; iii) t-RA reduced but did not deplete the side population in NB4 cells; iv) the expression of PML/RAR increased CD34+/CD38- population in KG-1 cells from 75% to over 95%; v) t-RA reduced the CD34+/CD38- population from 75% to 3,5% in mock transfected KG-1 confirming its capacity to induce differentiation, whereas in PML/RAR-positive KG-1 cells it led only to a reduction from 98% to a 25%, which still maintain the capacity to engraft in NOD-SCID mice; vi) also the expression of other fusion proteins, such as AML-1/ETO or PLZF/RAR, associated with t-RA-resistant AML-subtypes, increased the percentage of CD34+/CD38- KG-1 cells over 90%, which was reduced by t-RA only to 35% and 19%, respectively. Taken together these data suggest that a subset of early HSC expressing PML/RAR exhibit the same t-RA-resistant phenotype as HSC expressing fusion proteins associated with AML-subtypes which, in contrast to APL, do not respond to t-RA. These data may give an explanation, why APL-patients do not achieve complete molecular remission upon t-RA monotherapy and undergo early relapse.",
