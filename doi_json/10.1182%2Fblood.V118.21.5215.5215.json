    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5215 Introduction. Currently, the 5-year survival for childhood NHL is \u223c80%. Because of this high survival rate and since treatment is administered in a growing and developing individual, long-term side effects are an important issue. Studies on endocrine long-term effects in survivors of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) are scarce and often limited by small sample sizes, or by the fact that data of NHL survivors have been combined with that of survivors of other malignancies. Aim of this study was to investigate the long-term endocrine effects of treatment for childhood NHL. Methods. A single centre cohort of 84 survivors (22 females) was included in this retrospective study. Median age was 21 yrs (9\u201340 yrs) and time after cessation of therapy 12 yrs (4\u201330 yrs). Height, weight, percentage fat, lean body mass (LBM), bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density of total body (BMD TB ) and lumbar spine (BMD LS ) were measured. Bone mineral apparent density of the lumbar spine (BMAD LS ) was calculated to correct for bone size. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxin (fT4), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), Inhibin-B and anti-mu\u0308llerian hormone (AMH) levels were measured. Results were compared with Dutch controls. Results. Height was lower in survivors at follow-up (mean SDS \u22120.36, P= 0.002), but further analysis showed that shorter stature was already present at diagnosis (mean SDS \u22120.28, P= 0.023). BMI, percentage fat, BMC, BMD TB , BMD LS and BMAD LS were not different from controls. LBM was lower in survivors (mean SDS \u22120.47, P= 0.008). TSH, fT4 and IGF-1 were normal in all survivors. Three out of 20 adult females had low AMH levels and 55% (23/42) of adult males had low Inhibin-B levels. Conclusion. Twelve years after cessation of therapy, survivors of NHL did not develope adiposity, osteopenia or osteoporosis or thyroid disease. Male NHL survivors seem to be at risk for infertility.
