    "abstract_text": "Introduction For patients in need of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) but lacking an HLA matched donor, a haploidentical family donor is a particularly appealing alternative. However, to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), haploidentical HSCT necessitates intensive in vivo or ex vivo T-cell depletion that results in frequent and often lethal infectious complications and/or high relapse rates, thus decreasing overall survival. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a strategy that photodepletes host-reactive cells from the donor T cell graft, while preserving anti-infection and anti-leukemia reactivity. Patients and Methods In an open-label, multi-center phase 2 clinical trial (CR-AIR-007; NCT01794299), 12 of a planned 23 patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies were treated to date with this immunotherapy approach consisting of donor lymphocytes selectively allodepleted of host-reactive T-cells using photodynamic therapy (ATIR). ATIR was infused 28-32 days after haploidentical CD34-selected HSCT. No post-transplant GVHD prophylaxis was used. These patients were compared to a control group of 28 patients treated in a previous Phase 2 study with an investigational product manufactured using a process different from the Phase 1 trial and resulting mainly in dead and inactive cells instead of ATIR (CR-AIR-004). Results Twelve patients, mean age of 45 (range 21-64), 6 females/6 males with AML (n=9) and ALL (n=3) were treated with ATIR so far. ATIR consisted mainly of T-cells (>90%), with residual B and NK cells (\u226410%). Selective depletion of recipient-reactivity in each ATIR cell graft was assessed using a CFSE-based proliferation assay. Cell division numbers upon stimulation were analyzed using Modfit LT software (Fig 1A), which generated a proliferation index representing viable/reactive T-cells in donor cells (blue) and final ATIR product (green)(Fig 1B). Selective depletion of recipient-reactive T-cells with preservation of reactivity towards 3rd party antigens and anti-CD3/CD28 was observed in all ATIR cell grafts and used as a release criteria in the 007 study.

B) CFSE-based proliferation confirmed selective depletion of recipient-reactive T-cells in all grafts (representative depiction). Close modal Preparative regimen consisted of A) FTBI (1200 cGy; n=5) or B) melphalan (120 mg/m 2 ; n=7), along with thiotepa (10 mg/kg), fludarabine (30 mg/m 2 x5 d) and ATG (2.5 mg/kg x4 d). Neutrophil and platelet engraftment was achieved in all patients at a median of 12 days (range: 9-35). No patient experienced graft rejection. Patients (n=28) in the 004 control group, mean age of 42 (range 18-61), 13 females/15 males had AML (n=19), ALL (n=6) or MDS (n=3). CFSE proliferation in T-cell grafts could not be assessed a posteriori due to low cell viability. These 004 patients received the same A) FTBI- (n=14), B) melphalan- (n= 10) based preparative regimen as 007 patients, except for 4 patients receiving single fraction (800 cGy) TBI. Neutrophil and platelet engraftment was achieved at a median of 16 days (range: 7-54). Three patients showed secondary graft rejection. Two patients in study CR-AIR-007 developed acute GVHD grade I (skin only) approximately 130 days post HSCT, which was of short duration, (18 and 41 days). Two patients died of infection and no patient relapsed at a mean follow-up of 8 months post HSCT (range 1-14 months). In the CR-AIR-004 control group, 2 patients developed grade I, 1 patient grade II and 3 patients grade III GvHD, none of these cases were lethal. Seventeen patients died of transplant related complications and 2 patients of relapse/disease progression. TRM is 20% in 007 group vs 63% in the 004 control group and OS is 80% in 007 group vs 35% in the 004 control group at 9 months post-transplant (Figures 2A and 2B).

Results to date show that ATIR is safe and does not cause any grade III/IV GvHD. Moreover, haploidentical HSCT patients treated with ATIR demonstrate very promising TRM and OS rates when compared to the control group. Disclosures Roy: Kiadis Pharma: Consultancy, Research Funding.
