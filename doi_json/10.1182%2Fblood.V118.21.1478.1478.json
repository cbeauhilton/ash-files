    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1478 Background: The CALM-AF10 fusion protein that arises from the t(10;11) chromosomal translocation is found in both acute myeloid leukemia and 8\u201310% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and is associated with a poor clinical outcome. The interaction of AF10 with the DOT1L histone methyltransferase has been shown to be necessary for CALM-AF10 mediated transformation. However, the role of the Clathrin Assembly Lymphoid Myeloid leukemia (CALM) protein in leukemogenesis remains uncertain. CALM plays a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This process mediates the entry of various growth factor receptors and nutrients into cells and is essential for the internalization of iron-bound transferrin. Objective: We hypothesize that loss of CALM function, as a result of CALM haploinsufficiency and/or a dominant negative CALM-AF10 effect, may contribute to transformation. Design/Methods: To study the effects of CALM deficiency, we used genetically modified fit1 mice that harbor a Calm gene mutation that results in a severely truncated and nonfunctional Calm protein. Fetal liver (FL) cells from Calm \u2212/\u2212 , Calm +/\u2212 or Calm WT/WT E14 embryos were retrovirally transduced with MLL-ENL or CALM-AF10 and studied in vitro or transplanted into syngeneic mice. Interleukin-3 dependent cell lines were established from Calm \u2212/\u2212 or Calm WT control FL cells immortalized by CALM-AF10 or MLL-ENL . Results: CALM-AF10 leukemias induced in Calm \u2212/\u2212 or Calm +/\u2212 precursors were considerably delayed compared with those induced in Calm WT controls. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis of fluorescently labeled transferrin receptor (TfR) was impaired in Calm \u2212/\u2212 cells. This was accompanied by a 2\u20134 fold increase in surface expression of TfR by flow cytometry and an increase in total TfR protein as measured by Western blot in Calm \u2212/\u2212 cells. Calm -deficient cells also displayed lower levels of the iron storage protein ferritin, suggestive of an iron deficient state. Each of these features was reversed by re-expression of CALM via retroviral transduction of Calm \u2212/\u2212 cells with a CALM expression vector. Paralleling the prolonged latency of Calm \u2212/\u2212 leukemias, we found that Calm -deficient cells proliferated at a considerably slower rate than CALM -rescued cells. This cell proliferation defect could be rescued by supplementing the cells with iron (ferric ammonium citrate, 50 \u03bcM), indicating that reduced iron availability limits the expansion of Calm -deficient cells. Intriguingly, Calm \u2212/\u2212 cells were significantly more sensitive to the growth inhibitory effect of iron chelation (deferoxamine, 5 \u03bcM) than CALM -rescued cells. Conclusions: These observations suggest that loss of CALM function impairs iron import and consequently limits the rate of cell proliferation. This raises the possibility that CALM haploinsufficiency present in CALM-AF10 leukemias might render cells particularly responsive to iron chelation therapy.
