    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2684 Poster Board II-660 Background: R-CHOP is the standard treatment for elderly patients (pts) with DLBCL. Many pts aged 70 years (yrs) or more are unable to receive R-CHOP and the majority of them are excluded from clinical trials. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is an useful instrument to predict the clinical outcome of elderly pts with cancer. Within the GOL (Gruppo Oncoematologico Linfomi) we started a phase II study aiming to evaluate feasibility and activity of a CGA-driven chemotherapy for elderly pts with DLBCL Material and methods: Pts with no comorbidity received CHOP/R-CHOP; pts with mild cardiopathy received epirubicin instead of doxorubicin; in pts with moderate/severe cardiopathy the use of anthracyclines was omitted; pts with diabetes did not receive prednisone; in pts with neuropathy vincristine was omitted. The dosage of chemotherapy was decided according to CGA: pts with a good score (ADL=6 and IADL>6) received full doses of CT; pts with an intermediate score (ADL=5 and IADL>4) received 75% of the dose; pts with a poor score (ADL<5 and IADL<5) received 50% of the dose. Results: One hundred pts (41 males and 59 females) have been treated. The median age was 75 yrs and stages III-IV were diagnosed in 51% of pts. 61% of pts received full doses of CT; 25% received 75% of dose and 14% received 50% reduced dose; 86% of pts received an anthracycline and 54% rituximab. Toxicity was quite acceptable. Grade 3\u20134 neutropenia was observed in 30% of pts, mucositis in 12%, and peripheral neuropathy in 9%. Four toxic deaths were observed. Overall, 81% of pts achieved complete remission; with a median follow-up of 50 months, 20% of them have relapsed. The 5 yr-OS, DFS, EFS are 58%, 78% and 50%. It is remarkable that the 5-year specific survival is 72%. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that a CGA-driven approach is feasible in elderly pts with DLBCL. This strategy allows to offer a curative approach to all pts with aggressive NHL, avoiding to under treat pts with a potentially cured disease or over treat pts with severe comorbidities.
