    "abstract_text": "We investigated the mechanism of activation and functional role of a hitherto uncharacterized signaling molecule, RhoG, in platelets. RhoG is a ubiquitously expressed member of the Rho Family of GTPases. We demonstrated for the first time the expression [ Fig 1A ] and activation of RhoG [ Fig 1B ] in platelets. Platelet aggregation and dense-granule secretion in response to glycoprotein VI (GPVI) agonists, collagen-related peptide (CRP) and convulxin were significantly inhibited in RhoG-deficient platelets compared to wild type murine platelets [ Fig 1C ]. Integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation and \u03b1-granule secretion as measured by flow cytometry were also significantly inhibited in RhoG-deficient murine platelets downstream of GPVI agonists. In contrast, 2-MeSADP- and AYPGKF-induced platelet aggregation and secretion [ Fig 1D ] were minimally affected in RhoG deficient platelets, indicating that the function of RhoG in platelets is GPVI-specific. Figure 1 View large Download slide (A): Increasing amounts of human platelet lysate (in \u03bcg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, Western blotted, and probed with anti-RhoG antibody. (B) RhoG activation was measured upon stimulation of washed human platelets with 5\u03bcg/ml CRP for various times. Washed platelets were lysed and active GTP-bound RhoG was determined by pull-down analysis using bacterially expressed GST-ELMO. (C) Washed platelets from RhoG -/- mice and RhoG +/+ littermates were stimulated with GPVI agonists, 2.5 \u03bcg/ml CRP and 100 ng/ml convulxin and (D) G protein coupled receptor agonists, 30 nM 2MeSADP and 100 \u03bcM AYPGKF for 3.5 min under stirring conditions. Platelet aggregation and ATP secretion were measured by aggregometry.

Platelet aggregation and ATP secretion were measured by aggregometry. Close modal CRP-induced phosphorylations of Syk, Akt and ERK, but not Src family kinases (SFKs), were significantly reduced in RhoG-deficient platelets compared to those of wild type [ Fig 2A ]. Consistently, CRP-induced RhoG activation was abolished by pan-SFK inhibitor but not by Syk or PI 3-kinase inhibitors [ Fig 2B ]. Interestingly, unlike CRP, platelet aggregation and Syk phosphorylation induced by fucoidan, a CLEC-2 agonist, were unaffected in RhoG deficient platelets [ Fig 2C ]. Figure 2 View large Download slide (A): Washed platelets from RhoG -/- mice and RhoG +/+ littermates were stimulated with 2.5 \u03bcg/ml CRP and at 37 \u00b0C for 2 min and probed with anti-phospho-Syk (Tyr525/526), anti-phospho-Src (Tyr416), anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473), anti-phospho-ERK, or anti-\u03b2-actin (lane loading control) antibodies by western blotting. (B): RhoG activation induced by 5\u03bcg/ml CRP for 60 sec was evaluated in the presence and absence of 10 \u03bcM PP2, 2 \u03bcM OXSI-2, or 100nM wortmannin. (C): Wild type and RhoG-deficient platelets were stimulated with 100 \u03bcg/ml fucoidan and probed with anti-phospho-Syk (Tyr525/526), anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473), or anti-\u03b2-actin (lane loading control) antibodies by western blotting.

Close modal Finally, RhoG -/- mice had a significant delay in time to thrombotic occlusion in cremaster arterioles compared to wild type littermates [ Fig 3A and 3B ], indicating the important in vivo functional role of RhoG in platelets. Figure 3 View large Download slide ( A): Time required for occlusion of cremaster arterioles in RhoG +/+ and RhoG -/- mice was measured using microvascular thrombosis model with light/dye-induced injury. 5 mice of each genotype were used, and statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between the 2 genotypes of mice (*, P < .01). (B) Representative images of cremaster arterioles were taken from RhoG +/+ and RhoG -/- mice 30 min after the injury. As seen with the outline (arrows) of the thrombus formed, thrombus formation was inhibited in RhoG -/- mice.

Close modal In conclusion, we show for the first time that RhoG is expressed and activated in platelets, plays an important role in GPVI/FcR\u03b3-mediated platelet activation and is critical for thrombus formation in vivo.
