    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2634 The peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte/monocyte ratio (ALC/AMC) at diagnosis has been recently reported [Porrata et al, Hematologica 2012; 97(2):262-9] and confirmed [Koh et al, Oncologist 2012; 17(6):871-80] to be a predictor of clinical outcomes in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). In addition, an inversed correlation has been reported between the ALC/AMC ratio and tumor associated macrophages in classical HL suggesting an association between the host biological response in the macro-environment and micro-environment. However, a limitation of the ALC/AMC ratio at diagnosis, the International Prognostic Score at diagnosis, the Positron-Emission Tomography (PET-scan) at diagnosis, or interim PET-scan during treatment is their inability to sequentially assess the host/tumor interaction during treatment. Therefore, we studied the ALC/AMC ratio recovery, as a surrogate marker of host immunity (i.e., ALC) and tumor micro-environment (i.e., AMC), at each treatment cycle phase to assess its predictive ability for clinical outcomes in classical HL. To participate in the study, patients were required to be diagnosed, treated, and followed at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota and treated with adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) with or without radiation therapy. An ALC/AMC ratio \u2265 1.1 cut-off was used in the study based on our previous publication [Porrata et al, Hematologica 2012; 97(2):262-9]. From 1990 until 2008, 190 classical HL patients qualified for the study. The cohort was evenly split with 50% males and 50% females. Fifty-eight percent of the patients had an interim PET-scan performed. The median age at diagnosis was 36 years (range: 18\u201383 years). Seventeen patients received 2 cycles; 5 patients 3 cycles; 51 patients 4 cycles; 5 patients 5 cycles and 112 patients 6 cycles. The median follow-up was 3.7 years (range: 0.2\u201320 years). The ALC/AMC ratio \u2265 1.1 at each treatment cycle phase of ABVD was a predictor for overall survival (OS), lymphoma-specific survival (LSS), progression-free survival (PFS) and time to progression (TTP). Patients were stratified based on how many cycles the ALC/AMC ratio did not reach the cut-off of 1.1. The more cycles with an ALC/AMC < 1.1 the worse survival was observed. The 23 patients who did not achieve an ALC/AMC \u2265 1.1 during the treatment cycles phase experienced the worst survival rates: 5 year OS of 33%; 5 year LSS of 43%; 5 year PFS of 16%; and 5 year TTP of 27%. Patients were then dichotomized into patients that did not achieve an ALC/AMC ratio \u2265 1.1 for all the cycles versus patients with an ALC/AMC ratio \u2265 1.1 in any cycle during treatment. Patients with an ALC/AMC ratio \u2265 1.1 in any cycle (N=167) experienced better survival compared with patients that in all cycles the ALC/AMC ratio was < 1.1 [ OS, the hazard ratio(HR) was 0.09, 95% CI (0.04\u20130.19), p < 0.0001; for LSS, HR =0.07, 95% CI (0.02\u20130.17), p <0.0001; for PFS, HR = 0.08, 95%CI (0.04\u20130.14), p < 0.0001; and for TTP, HR = 0.05, 95% CI (0.02\u20130.11), p < 0.0001]. In the multivariate analysis, an ALC/AMC ratio \u2265 1.1 in any cycle versus none was an independent predictor for clinical outcome when compared to ALC/AMC ratio at diagnsosis, PET-scan, International Prognostic Score, limited verus advanced stage, and radiation therapy [OS, HR = 0.14, 95% CI (0.04\u20130.40), p< 0.0002; for LSS, HR = 0.09, 95% CI (0.01\u20130.37), p <0.0006); for PFS, HR = 0.19, 95% CI (0.05\u20130.82), p < 0.03); and for TTP, HR = 0.15, 95% CI (0.02\u20130.89), p < 0.02]. In conclusion, the ALC/AMC ratio during ABVD treatment cycles in classical HL is a predictor for survival and provides an opportunity to develop therapeutic modalities to manipulate the ALC/AMC ratio during ABVD chemotherapy to improve clinical outcomes in classical HL.
