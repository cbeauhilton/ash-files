    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) is a rare type of acute leukemia that shows no evidence of differentiation along any lineage. Clinical, immunophenotypic and genetic data is limited: the largest study to date reported 16 AUL cases but did not use the current WHO classification and included limited genetic data on 5 cases (Ann Hematol 2013 92:747-758). Moreover, it is uncertain if AUL is biologically distinct from acute myeloid leukemia with minimal differentiation (AML MD), which also shows limited myeloid marker expression and has been reported to have a poor prognosis. Methods: A total of 95 cases (36 AUL cases 59 AML MD) were identified from pathology databases of eight academic institutions with available diagnostic flow cytometric data, cytogenetic findings, and clinical data by searching for diagnoses of \"AUL\" or \"AML MD\". Diagnosis of AUL required absence of any lineage-defining markers including MPO, CD19 and CD3. Using the WHO classification, diagnosis of AML with MD required expression of at least 2 myeloid markers (CD117, CD13 or CD33), absence of myeloid maturation (CD15) or monocytic markers (CD64, CD11b, lysozyme or non-specific esterase). Next generation sequencing with extensive mutational panel data was available in 78 cases. Outcome analysis for overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) and were performed using Kaplan Meier and log rank test for patients who received induction chemotherapy. Results: Based on cytogenetic abnormalities (N=27) or history of MDS (N=2), according to the 2016 WHO Classification, 28 cases (6 AUL and 22 AML MD) were re-classified as AML with myelodysplasia related changes (AML MRC). The remaining 30 AUL patients presented with similar age, blood counts, bone marrow cellularity, and blast percentage as the 37 AML MD patients (all p > 0.05). Comparison of immunophenotype in the two groups showed that AUL blasts had more frequent expression of TdT (p=0.0003) and lacked myeloid markers (CD117, CD13 or CD33 p0.05) were seen between these two groups. The frequency of abnormal karyotype was similar between AUL and AML MD (16/30 [53%] vs 15/37 [41%], respectively). The most common mutations identified in AUL were PHF6 (7/18), SRSF2 (7/18), RUNX1 (7/23), ASXL1 (6/23) and BCOR (5/16). Compared to AML MD, AUL cases were characterized by frequent mutations in PHF6 (7/18 vs 1/23, p=0.013) and SRSF2 (7/18 vs 2/22 p=0.028). Limiting AUL cases to only those with 1 myeloid marker or less also showed similar findings with more frequent mutations in PHF6 (7/16 vs 1/25, p=0.0031), SRSF2 (6/15 vs 3/26 p= 0.018) and trend towards higher BCOR frequency (5/15 vs 2/26, p=0.078) in AUL patients as compared to AML MD. RUNX1 mutation was seen in 7/23 AUL and 8/29 AML MD (p>0.05). 19/30 AUL patients received induction chemotherapy (AML-type regimen in 18 cases and an ALL-type regimen in 1 case) and 15/30 achieved complete remission. In 10 AUL patients who relapsed, 9 showed identical immunophenotype and one case showed expression of CD13 and CD33. Outcome data in the subset of patients who received induction showed no difference in OS, RFS, or rates of complete remission between AUL and AML MD groups (p>0.05). The 28 AML MRC cases that were originally classified as AUL or AML MD presented with lower WBC (p=0.026), more frequent abnormal karyotype (27/28) specifically complex karyotype (20/28 p=0.002), frequent TP53 mutations (p=0.0002) when compared to the AUL group. AML MRC patients showed worse overall OS (p=0.029) as compared with AUL patients and a trend toward worse outcome as compared with AML MD (p=0.068). Conclusions: In this largest series to date, AUL group shows distinct characteristics from AML MD, including more frequent PHF6 and SRSF2 mutations and expression of TdT. However, clinical outcome is similar between the two groups in patients treated with induction chemotherapy. Cases reclassified as AML-MRC had shorter survival compared to de novo AUL and trend towards worse outcome when compared to AML MD patients. These results suggest a genetic rationale for the separation of AUL as a distinct entity from AML MD and also support the WHO classification of cases with history of prior MDS and/or MDS-type karyotype findings as AML-MRC.
