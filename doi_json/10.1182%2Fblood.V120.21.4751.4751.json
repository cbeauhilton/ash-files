    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4751 Background. In thalassemia patients ineffective erythropoiesis appears to be caused by accelerated apoptosis, in turn caused primarily by deposition of a-globin chains in erythroid precursors. The bone marrow is the main site of the erythroid cell death. The occurrence of apoptosis at the polychromatophilic stage coincides with the stage where intensive hemoglobinization occurs and could be explained by the increase in a-globin production and precipitation. The mechanism of BM apoptosis is also observed in sickle cell anemia (SCA), but is reduced. We report our experience concerning 12 geno-identical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for SCA-patients, to analyse the effect of transplant on \u201cnormalization\u201d of intramedullary apoptosis. Patients and Methods. Twelve patients with a median age of 12 years (range, 2\u201316), affected by sickle cell anemia (SCA), received hematopoietic stem cell transplantations from HLA-identical, related donors following a myeloablative conditioning regimen. We studied Fas (CD95+) and caspases-3 expression on erythroblast subpopulation. Using both CD71 and FSC parameters, we obtain 3 principal populations, which we labelled A, B, C erythroblasts (Ery. A, Ery. B, Ery. C). Ery A (CD71 high FSC high ) are basophilic, Ery. B (CD71 high FSC low ) are late basophilic and polychromatic, whereas Ery. C (CD71 low FSC low ) are orthochromatic erythroblasts and reticulocytes. Results. We observed an expansion of Ery A, Ery B and Ery C population at baseline, probably as an essential process needed to maintain a constant red cell production in SCA patients (42.4% Ery A; 24.7% Ery B; 35.6% Ery C). After BM transplant decreased levels was observed especially on Ery A and Ery B populations (12.9% Ery A; 7% Ery B; 35% Ery C). After BM transplant Fas expression was reduced in all 3 erythroid population, but significantly on more immature Ery A (17% vs 3.5% CD95+ on Ery A; 32.2 vs 24.4 on Ery B; 5% vs 3.3% on Ery C). This observation may suggest that Fas, expressed by early erythroblasts in vivo, might contribute to the cell death of erythroid precursors in bone marrow, but this was corrected after HSCT. In addition, only after transplant we observed an initial increase of caspases 3 on more mature Ery C population (2.3% at baseline vs. 15.3% after transplant), as observed during later steps of \u201cnormal\u201d cell maturation. Conclusion. After HSCT in SCA we observed a \u201cnormalization\u201d of erythroid populations, in parallel with decreased intramedullary apoptosis rate, suggesting normal erythroid maturation in ex-SCA patients.
