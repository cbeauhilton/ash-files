    "abstract_text": "Background: Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is an important component of conditioning regimens to prevent severe GVHD in patients undergoing unmanipulated haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT). However, the optimal dose of ATG is unknown. Methods: In this open-label extension of a prospective, randomised trial, we compared the long-term outcomes of two ATG doses used in myeloablative conditioning before unmanipulated haplo-HSCT. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to 10 mg/kg (ATG-10) or 6 mg/kg (ATG-6) ATG. Patients and individuals assessing outcomes were masked to treatment allocation. Analysis of disease-free survival (DFS), GVHD-free/relapse-free survival (GRFS), relapse, non-relapse mortality (NRM), and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) included the entire population. Late effects were assessed in disease-free patients who had survived for at least 6 months and had received regular follow-up evaluations. Results: Between December 2010 and May 2012, 224 patients were recruited. The median follow-up period was 1614 days (28-1929 days). The 5-year cumulative incidence was comparable between the ATG-6 and ATG-10 groups for relapse (12\u00b78% vs. 13\u00b74%, p=0\u00b7832) and NRM (11\u00b76% vs. 17\u00b70%, p=0\u00b7263). The 5-year probability of DFS was comparable between groups (75\u00b76% vs. 69\u00b76%, p=0\u00b7283). The 5-year cumulative incidence was higher with ATG-6 for cGVHD (75\u00b70% vs. 56\u00b73%, p=0\u00b7007; moderate-to-severe cGVHD: 56\u00b73% vs. 30\u00b74%, p<0\u00b70001) and late effects (71\u00b72% vs. 56\u00b79%, p=0\u00b7043). The 5-year probability of GRFS was higher with ATG-10 (41\u00b70% vs. 26\u00b78%, p=0\u00b7008). In the multivariate analysis, ATG-10 was associated with lower cGVHD risk and improved GRFS. Conclusions: ATG 10 mg/kg may be the optimal dose for conditioning regimens before unmanipulated haplo-SCT. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
