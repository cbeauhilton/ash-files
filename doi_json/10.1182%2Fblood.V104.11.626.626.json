    "abstract_text": "Sulfatide (galactocylceramide 3\u2032-sulfate) is a sulfated glycosphingolipid expressed on the surfaces of erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets and a variety other cells, that is known to interact with several cell adhesion molecules involved in hemostasis, including von Willebrand factor (VWF), laminin, thrombospondin, P-selectin and \u03b22-glycoprotein I. Because these ligands are involved in many platelet adhesive interactions, we hypothesize that membrane sulfatide plays an important role in these processes. To examine this, we have cloned and purified a sulfatide-specific single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody from a phage-display library constructed from mRNA taken from the lymphocytes of patients with systemic lupus erythematosis. This scFv, PA38, specifically bound sulfatide, and did not react with the related sphingolipids cerebroside, ceramide, or sphingomyelin, or the phospholipids phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, or phosphatidylethanolamine. Using this tool, we examined the role of sulfatide in platelet function. We observed that PA38 dose-dependently (at 5 and 10 \u03bcg/ml) inhibited the aggregation of human platelets induced by either collagen or ADP. A control scFv produced in a similar manner had no effect. Furthermore, PA38 delayed platelet plug formation by 23 sec (with collagen-ADP agonist) and 46 sec (with collagen-epinephrine) in whole blood from normal human donors, as measured in a platelet function analyzer, PFA-100 (Dade Behring). Further, to verify that this was a sulfatide-specific effect, we compared collagen-induced platelet aggregation in normal mice to that of mice deficient in cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST)\u2014a critical enzyme in the sulfatide synthetic pathway. The CST \u2212/\u2212 mice fail to express sulfatide on the cell surface, and displayed defective platelet aggregation. Consistent with this, the PA38 also significantly inhibited collagen-induce platelet aggregation in wild-type mice. Given the importance of lipid rafts in signaling and adhesive processes, we looked for the localization of sulfatide in these membrane microdomains. Indeed, we found that sulfatide is enriched in lipid rafts suggesting a role for sulfatide in lipid-raft mediated events. Thus, we provide evidence for a key role of a membrane lipid, sulfatide in the adhesive interactions involved in platelet function. With one notable exception, the key adhesive roles in platelet-platelet interaction have all previously been assigned to proteins."
