    "abstract_text": "Objectives Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) -1 is a receptor as a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on the cell-surface of neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages. This receptor amplifies the inflammatory response, activating the signaling pathway. TREM-1 expression is associated with mature myeloid cell development. TREM-1 is shed from the membrane of activated macrophages without the transmembrane and intracellular domains, and can be found as soluble TREM (sTREM)-1. Soluble TREM-1 is thought to negatively regulate TREM receptor signaling. Some studies currently reported that TREM-1 regulates the malignant behavior of cancer cells in lung cancer and HCC. However, no related studies about the role of TREM-1 in leukemia have been carried out. The aims of this study was investigated the TREM-1 expression in myelogenous leukemia cells. Methods Thirty-five patients with AML, twenty-five patients with CML and a control group of eleven healthy people were subjected to the study. TREM-1 expressions on the surfaces of leukemia cells were measured by flow cytometry. Plasma sTREM-1 levels were measured by ELISA. Results In this study, our results provide the first evidence that TREM-1 was differentially expressed in myelogenous leukemia cells. The TREM-1 mean ratio of median fluorescence intensity (mean ratio of MFI) was 3.13\u00b10.88 and 2.52\u00b10.40 in CML and AML patients, respectively. The TREM-1 mean ratio of MFI was 3.03\u00b11.40 in myelogenous leukemia cell lines (K562, HL60, THP-1). The TREM-1 mean ratio of MFI was 5.37\u00b10.88 in healthy controls. Compared to healthy controls, myelogenous leukemia cells had decreased TREM-1 expressions (P0.1). In addition, the plasma sTREM-1 levels were measured by ELISA. sTREM-1 levels was 48.54\u00b157.63pg/mL for AML group and 43.72\u00b123.93pg/mL for CML group. Results indicated that plasma sTREM-1 levels significantly higher in AML and CML patients than that in healthy controls (P0.1). An ongoing project focuses on the relationship between the function of TREM-1 and occurrence, progression and prognosis of myelogenous leukemia, advances will be reported in time. Conclusion TREM-1 expression on leukemia cells was significantly lower in patients with AML and CML than those in healthy controls and patients in complete remission had increased TREM-1 expression. Patients with AML and CML had increased plasma soluble TREM-1. The TREM-1 expression on leukemia cells had an inverse correlation with plasma sTREM-1 level in AML and CML patients.
