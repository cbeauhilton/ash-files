    "abstract_text": "The BCL6 (B-Cell-Lymphoma-6) transcriptional repressor is a critical oncogene in B-cell lymphomas and is required for establishment of germinal centers by normal B-cells. However, the mechanisms by which BCL6 licenses germinal center formation and lymphomagenesis are unknown. To characterize this mechanism we identified BCL6 target genes by expression arrays and high throughput chromatin immunoprecipitations. Remarkably, a number of these target genes were critical mediators of DNA damage sensing checkpoints including ATR and p53. Therefore, we hypothesized that BCL6 could attenuate DNA damage sensing by silencing these genes, which is likely a critical attribute for survival and proliferation of germinal center B-cells cells undergoing somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR). Accordingly, we found that expression of BCL6 in normal diploid fibroblasts could block cellular sensing of DNA damage as demonstrated by loss of histone 2AX (H2AX) phosphorylation and delayed repair of double strand breaks. Repression of ATR (but not p53 or other targets) was required for this phenotype. This is a physiological effect since the same result was observed when BCL6 was expressed in purified primary human tonsilar mature B-cells. Reciprocally, shRNA knockdown of BCL6 in B-cell lymphomas rescued repression of ATR, enhanced H2AX phosphorylation and accelerated repair of double strand breaks, independent of the status of p53. shRNA knockdown of BCL6 caused a marked increase of apoptosis in lymphoma cells in response to DNA damage, due to restored DNA damage checkpoint functions. Importantly, BCL6 knockdown had an identical effect on ATR levels, H2AX phosphorylation, DNA damage, and survival in purified primary human germinal center centroblasts. These results suggest that a major role of BCL6 in germinal center formation is to attenuate cellular response to DNA damage occurring as a byproduct of CSR and SHM. The same mechanism also seems to be required for lymphomagenesis, since we observed that sustained BCL6 expression in human primary mature B-cells leads to aberrant survival properties and genomic instability. Moreover, BCL6 blockade using a specific inhibitor molecule designed by our lab induces apoptosis in lymphoma cells and synergizes with DNA damaging agents. Therefore, we have identified a critical mechanism of action of the BCL6 oncoprotein in normal and pathogenic states and show that specific targeting of BCL6 could synergize with chemotherapy drugs for the therapy of B-cell lymphomas.",
