    "abstract_text": "Chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IGH @ ) locus and variuos partner loci are frequently associated with multiple myeloma (MM). We investigated the expression profiles of FGFR3/MMSET , CCND1 , CCND3 , MAF and MAFB genes, respectively involved in t(4;14)(p16.3;q32), t(11;14)(q13;q32), t(6;14)(p21;q32), t(14;16)(q32;q23) and t(14;20)(q32;q12), in purified plasma cell populations from 39 MMs and six plasma cell leukemias (PCL) using DNA microarray analysis, and compared the results with the presence of translocations as assessed by dual-color FISH or RT-PCR. The t(4;14) was found in six MMs, t(11;14) in 9 MMs and 1 PCL, t(6;14) in one MM, t(14;16) in 2 MMs and 1 PCL, and t(14;20) in one PCL. The translocations were associated with the spiked expression of target genes in all cases. Furthermore, gene expression profiling allowed the identification of putative translocations dysregulating CCND1 (1 MM and 1 PCL) and MAFB (1 MM and 1 PCL) without any apparent involvement of immunoglobulin loci. Notably, all of the translocations were mutually exclusive. Markedly increased levels of MMSET expression were found in one MM showing associated FGFR3 and MMSET signals on an unidentified chromosome. Our data suggest the importance of using combined molecular cytogenetic and gene expression approaches to detect genetic aberrations in MM.",
