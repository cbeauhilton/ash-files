    "abstract_text": "Transfection with tumor antigen RNA is one of the promising tools not only because of a possible sufficient amplification of tumor antigen RNA but also because of the absence of antigen peptides-associated MHC restriction. Several succeeded experiments about generation of CTLs using DCs transfeced in vitro transcribed (IVT) cancer specific antigen mRNA such as PSA, CEA, hTERT and MUC-1 have been reported in these a few years. In addition, recent reports about the simultaneous presentation of peptides in both MHC class I and class II molecules on DCs after mRNA electroporation show another superiority of mRNA transfection into DCs. In this presentation, we demonstrate successful generation of tumor antigen specific CTLs using with DCs transfected with IVT mRNA such as SART-1 and WT-1 by electroporation. This is the first report about the generation of SART-1 and WT-1 specific CTLs by using mRNA transfected DCs. [Methods] HLA-A24 positive human PB CD14 + cell-derived DCs were transfected with IVT mRNA (SART-1and WT-1) by electroporation. MRNA transfected DCs were co-cultured with autologous lymphocytes. The bulk co-cultures were re-stimulated several times with same DCs. CD8 + cells were separated and CTL activity was evaluated by 51 chromium release assay. To determine whether the induced CTL cells could recognize the target cells in an HLA class I restricted manner, anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibodies were utilized to block the cytotoxicity of effectors. [Results] Electroporation of mRNA showed no effect on the surface phenotypes and antigen presenting ability of DCs. In addition to the demonstration of efficient transfection of M1 mRNA into DCs by using RT-PCR, which eliminated the amplification of transfected mRNA by the treatment with RNase before RNA extraction from the transfected cells, we identified the definite expression of WT-1 protein in the cytoplasm of DCs by using immunoblotting. CTL assay indicated that 1) DCs transfected with mRNA stimulated the generation of antigen-specific CTLs which are capable of lysing autologous DCs transfected with the same mRNA. 2) CTLs also demonstrated cytotoxic ability against cell lines such as KE-4 presenting SART-1 peptides on HLA-A24, MEGO1 presenting WT-1 peptides on MHC class I, and HLA-A24 cDNA transfected T2 which were used as target cells after co- incubation with 9 mer SART-1 peptides with strong affinity to HLA-A24. 3) Each cytotoxicities were markedly blocked after co-incubation of target cells with anti-MHC class I antibody and not inhibited with anti-MHC class II antibody. [Conclusion] Our results showed that IVT mRNA-transfected DCs which is constructed non-virally have a highly efficient ability to stimulate specific T-cell immunity against tumor. Unlike peptide- or tumor cells extract-pulsed DCs based vaccines, anti-tumor immunotherapy using the DCs transfected with antigen mRNA could be extended to a wide range of patients who have previously been excluded from clinical trials for the reason of the un-identification of tumor specific antigens, for the reason of the impossibility of obtaining sufficient tumor specimens, or for the reason of MHC restriction of the tumor specific antigens.",
