    "abstract_text": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is characterized by marked defects in CD4+ helper T cell (Th) functions that commonly progress to a substantial decline in peripheral CD4+ T cell counts. However, the mechanisms responsible for the loss of Th functions in HIV-infected patients independent of CD4+ T cell counts remains unclear. CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (T Reg) are essential for down-regulation of both autoreactive and alloreactive T cells. Therefore, we decided to investigate the role of T Reg in immune status of HIV-infected patients. We examined the expression of cell surface CD25, cytoplasmic IL-4 and cytoplasmic IFN-gamma in peripheral blood CD4+ T cells from both healthy controls ( n =9) and HIV-infected patients ( n =43). We also compared T Reg functions between the 2 groups. CD4+CD25+ T Reg isolated from both HIV-infected patients and healthy controls strongly expressed CD45RO, HLA-DR, and FoxP3, and suppressed the proliferation of CD4+CD25\u2212 T cells, suggesting that CD4+CD25+ T cells from both healthy controls and HIV-infected patients possess phenotypic and functional characteristics of Treg. CD4+CD25high T cells are a subset of circulating CD4+CD25+ T cells in normal humans and exhibit strong in vitro regulatory functions similar to those reported for murine CD4+CD25+ T Reg. We measured the frequency of CD4+CD25high T Reg by analysis of surface CD25 on CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood samples. We also examined Th1 and Th2 frequencies by analysis of cytoplasmic IFN-gamma and IL-4 levels in CD4+ T cells. T Reg from HIV-infected patients with detectable plasma HIV-1 RNA showed a statistically significant increase in CD4+CD25high cell frequency ( p <0.05) compared to healthy controls, with T Reg frequencies inversely proportional to CD4+ T cell numbers ( p <0.01). However, in HIV-infected patients with undetectable plasma HIV-RNA, frequencies of CD4+CD25high T Reg were not increased and not related to CD4+ T cell numbers. In both HIV-infected patient groups, T Reg frequency was inversely related to Th1 frequency (detectable: p <0.05, undetectable: p <0.001), but positively related to Th2 frequency (detectable: p <0.01, undetectable: p <0.001). Our results indicate that increased frequencies of peripheral blood T Reg were related to disease progression as measured by detectable plasma HIV-1 RNA, decreased peripheral blood CD4+ T cell counts, and polarization toward Th2 immune responses in HIV-infected patients. HIV infection may lead to induction of T reg that inhibit antiviral immune responses, resulting in the progression of the disease. Manipulation of T Reg could help restore antiviral immune responses in HIV infection, and prevent the progression of HIV infection.",
