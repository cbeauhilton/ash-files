    "abstract_text": "Natural killer (NK) cells are capable of cytotoxic targeting of virally infected cells and some tumor cells. It has been well-demonstrated that NK cells recognize target cells that have down-regulated MHC class I antigen expression (i.e. \u201cmissing self recognition\u201d), and that it is the lack of class I engagement of inhibitory receptors such as the killer Ig-like receptors (KIR) that thereby allows NK activation and effector function. How these same inhibitory receptors achieve self-tolerance and simultaneously avoid autoimmunity in humans has not been clear, as more than 60% of individuals have inhibitory KIR for which they lack the HLA ligand. We demonstrate that mature NK cells achieve self-tolerance by preferentially endowing functional competence to the inhibitory KIRs for which they exhibit the cognate HLA ligands. To allow evaluation of inhibitory KIR and avoid interference from potentially class-I recognizing activating KIR, we analyzed NK cells from 10 individuals with various HLA backgrounds, but who were all homozygous for KIR haplotype-A. KIR haplotype-A contains the inhibitory KIR receptors 2DL3, 2DL1, and 3DL1, specific for HLA-Cw3, -Cw4, and -Bw4 ligands respectively, in addition to at most one other activating KIR whose ligand is unknown. Using 6-color staining and flow cytometric analysis of intracellular IFN-\u03b3 production, we evaluated the responsiveness of 30 inhibitory KIR-expressing NK subsets following activation with 721.221, a target cell line deficient in class I expression, with 721.221 transfectants expressing HLA-Cw3, -Cw4, or -Bw4 ligands, and with B-lymphocyte cell lines with diverse HLA phenotypes. NK cells exclusively expressing an inhibitory KIR for self-HLA demonstrated increased IFN-\u03b3 when coincubated with target cells lacking the cognate HLA ligand, whereas NK cells exclusively expressing an inhibitory KIR for non-self HLA were hyporesponsive to all targets. In all individuals, NK cells expressing inhibitory KIR specific for self-HLA were significantly more responsive than NK cells expressing inhibitory KIR for non-self HLA (p<0.001). All 3 inhibitory KIR (KIR2DL3, 2DL1, and 3DL1) demonstrated capacity for tolerance, with predictable response patterns based on the HLA background of the individual. NK cells lacking all inhibitory NK receptors (KIR \u2212 CD94/NKG2A \u2212 ILT2 \u2212 ) were identifiable and were markedly hyporesponsive. KIR \u2212 CD94/NKG2A + ILT2 + NK cells were also minimally responsive, comparable to the NK subset expressing inhibitory KIR for non-self HLA. These results demonstrate NK tolerance in humans, consistent with the licensing model proposed in mice: NK cells expressing inhibitory KIR to self-HLA are significantly more responsive than NK cells expressing inhibitory KIR for non-self HLA, and are rendered tolerant to self through inhibition upon binding to self-HLA ligands. NK cells expressing inhibitory KIR for non-self HLA are hyporesponsive and therefore rendered tolerant and incapable of autoreactivity when ligand is not engaged.",
