    "abstract_text": "AML patients with TP53 mutations have extremely poor clinical outcomes. This is due primarily to limited responses to available therapies including the highly promising FDA-approved combination of Bcl-2 inhibition by venetoclax (VEN) with hypomethylating agents (DiNardo CD et al., Blood 2020), which resulted in CR/CRi rates of 70-95% and good tolerability in elderly patients (DiNardo CD et al., Lancet Oncol 2018 and Blood 2019). Apoptosis is regulated by anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins. While p53 does not directly regulate anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins that are resistance factors for VEN, p53 transcriptionally up-regulates pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Reverse phase protein array analysis of samples from newly-diagnosed AML patients found that pro-apoptotic Bax was significantly decreased in patients with TP53 mutations (Carter BZ, ASH 2019), which, as expected, diminished the effectiveness of Bcl-2 inhibition. Thus, strategies to target additional anti-apoptotic proteins, or increase pro-apoptotic proteins, are needed to enhance the efficacy of Bcl-2 inhibition in these patients. We determined protein levels of Bcl-2 family members in isogeneic Molm13 cells with TP53-knockout (KO), or with various hotspot TP53 mutations including R175H, Y220C, M237I, R248Q, R273H, and R282W. We observed markedly decreased Bax expression, to a less degree Bak decrease, and variable alterations in other Bcl-2 proteins in these cells compared to TP53-wild-type (WT) controls. We treated the aforementioned cells with VEN or the Mcl-1 inhibitor AMG 176 and found that TP53-KO or mutant cells were more resistant to both VEN and AMG 176 compared to WT controls. However, the combination of two inhibitors was highly synergistic in both settings, controls (CI = 0.2) and TP53-KO and mutant cells (CI < 0.1). To demonstrate that the decreased sensitivity to BH3 mimetics was, at least in part, mediated through Bax reduction in the TP53-mutant cells, we treated Bax knockdown (KD) Molm13 cells with VEN, AMG 176, or both. The Bax KD cells were resistant to VEN and AMG 176, while the combination of the two agents synergistically induced cell death. To establish potential clinical relevance of co-targeting Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 in TP53-mutant AML, we co-cultured cells from various TP53-mutant AML patients (n = 8) with mesenchymal stromal cells and treated them with VEN, AMG 176, or both. The combination synergistically induced cell death in both CD45 + leukemia blasts (CI values between 0.04 \u00b1 0.04 to 0.34 \u00b1 0.10) and CD34 + AML stem/progenitor cells (CI values between 0.07 \u00b1 0.08 to 0.28 \u00b1 0.14). RNA-sequencing of mononuclear and MRD cells of clinical samples (Issa G, ASH 2019) collected after induction therapy revealed that Mcl-1 expression was significantly higher in the TP53-mutated mononuclear and MRD cells compared to their WT counterparts (Fig. 1), which suggests that Mcl-1 contributes to treatment resistance and disease relapse. This further suggests that Mcl-1 inhibition should be incorporated in AML treatment, including VEN-based therapies, for patients with TP53 mutations. Finally, we treated NSG mice inoculated with isogeneic TP53-WT luciferase/GFP-labeled Molm13 and BFP-labeled TP53 R248W/R213* Molm13 cells (10:1) with VEN, AMG 176, or their combination. Only the combination treatment markedly decreased the number of GFP- and BFP-labeled cells in circulation and significantly prolonged mouse survival (median 23 d, 25 d, 24.5 d for control, VEN, AMG 176, respectively; and 45 d for VEN + AMG 176: P = 0.0007, 0.0009, and 0.0011 of combination vs. control, VEN, and AMG 176, respectively) (Fig. 2). Collectively, we demonstrate that decreased Bax contributes to resistance of TP53-mutant AML to BH3 mimetics. Mcl-1 expression positively impacts therapy resistance and disease reoccurrence in TP53-mutant AML. Thus, targeting Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 individually is insufficient and inhibition of both proteins is needed to shift cell fate from survival to death and circumvents resistance of TP53 deficient/mutant AML and AML stem/progenitor cells to BH3 mimetics. The concept warrants further clinical evaluation.
