    "abstract_text": "The molecular mechanism governing the ability of activated factor V (FVa) within prothrombinase to accelerate prothrombin activation is not well understood. It is possible that FVa provides a docking surface for prothrombin, and/or causes a conformational change in FXa which exposes an exosite that enhances the presentation of the substrate to the active site of the enzyme. While there is indirect evidence that FVa binds prothrombin via (pro)exosite I, it is not entirely clear whether this interaction directly leads to the enhanced function of prothrombinase. It has been speculated that the corresponding binding site for (pro)exosite I on FVa is contributed by hirudin-like acidic sequences at the C-terminus of the heavy chain (659\u2013709). In support of this, peptide inhibition studies indicate that residues Asp 695 to Tyr 698 are required for optimal prothrombinase function and likely provide a binding site for prothrombin. To directly assess the role of this region in prothrombin activation we exploited a novel strategy in which recombinant FVa (rFVa) variants truncated at the C-terminus of the heavy chain were produced. The entire B-domain and heavy chain sequences were removed and a PACE-furin cleavage site was introduced between these deleted residues and the light chain generating: FVa 659 (des 660\u20131545 ), FVa 679 (des 680\u20131545 ), FVa 693 (des 694\u20131545 ), FVa 700 (des 701\u20131545 ), and FVa 709 (des 710\u20131545 ). These single-chain proteins were intracellularly processed and secreted into the media as two-chain proteins with appropriate truncations to the heavy chain. Factor Va 709 served as a control as it is chemically identical to plasma-derived (PD)-FVa and rFVa. Following stable expression and purification in high yield, SDS-PAGE and N-terminal sequence analysis suggested the derivatives were correctly processed. Factor Va 709 , rFVa and PD-FVa had high specific activities (~1500 U/mg) in a one stage PT-based clotting assay. Surprisingly, we found that FVa 679 , FVa 693 , and FVa 700 exhibited specific clotting activities comparable to the wild-type cofactors. Detailed kinetic studies using prothrombin and saturating amounts of cofactor revealed that both the K m and k cat values for each of these variants were essentially equivalent to wild-type FVa. We observed minor differences (<4-fold) in the kinetic parameters when using prethrombin-1. Direct fluorescent and kinetic measurements also indicated that these variants bound FXa-membranes with high affinity. An exception to these findings was FVa 659 , which only had a minor reduction in the k cat for prothrombin (~1.5-fold), but had ~1\u20132% clotting activity and an increased K m (4-fold) and decreased k cat value for prethrombin-1 (>13-fold). Direct binding fluorescent measurements indicated that this variant had a marked reduction in the binding affinity for FXa-membranes (>15-fold). Additionally, the maximal fluorescent signal was reduced (~2-fold), further suggesting that this derivative interacts with FXa-membranes differently compared to wild-type FVa. Surprisingly, these data demonstrate that deletion of residues 679\u2013709 does not impair cofactor function towards the physiological substrate prothrombin. Additionally, deletion of residues 659\u2013709 only appears to significantly compromise FXa binding, a finding that likely explains the reduced functional activity of FVa 659 . Our results suggest that any possible binding interactions between prothrombin and the C-terminal acidic region on the FVa heavy chain do not contribute in a detectable way to the enhanced function of prothrombinase.",
