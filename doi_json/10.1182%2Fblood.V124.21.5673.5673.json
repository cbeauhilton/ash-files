BACKGROUND: About 24,050 new cases of Multiple Myeloma are expected to be diagnosed in 2014. In a metropolitan institution, such as Henry Ford Hospital, newly diagnosed patients are drawn from multiple ethnic backgrounds. While several epidemiological studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between race and values of several diagnostic markers (such as hemoglobin, creatinine and albumin), most of the research focused on molecular and genetic, as opposed to clinical, differences in patients from multiple ethnicities. Our study, therefore attempted to offer a more customized diagnostic approach to patients with newly diagnosed Multiple myeloma, based on their ethnicity, and to determine if there was a correlation between the patients' races and common diagnostic elements, including the CRAB criteria, at time of diagnosis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study. Data from 300 patients over 5 years (2007-2012) with newly diagnosed with Multiple myeloma was collected. Only 197 patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria and were included in the final analysis. The following data was extracted: Age at diagnosis, gender, diagnostic elements according to the CRAB criteria (serum Calcium, serum Creatinine, Anemia, Bone lytic lesions) at date of diagnosis, serum beta-2-microglobulin level, M-protein serum concentration, and whether Urine monoclonal protein excretion was present. The patients were divided into two groups by race: African American and Caucasian. An overall score was created by summing the incidence of each diagnostic marker. RESULTS: Categorical data was compared between the two groups using chi-square tests, and CRAB score was compared using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test due to its ordinal nature. Our study demonstrated that there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in any of the components collected, or in the final total score CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference in the original diagnostic markers, including the CRAB criteria, in Multiple Myeloma Patients from Different Ethnicities presenting to our Institution. The effect of baseline cytogenetic characteristics on the diagnostic markers between multiple myeloma patients from different ethnicities is still not fully understood, and might be a factor that needs to be studied further.
