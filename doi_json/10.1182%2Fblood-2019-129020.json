    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Patients (pts) with myelofibrosis (MF) experience a broad array of symptoms that negatively affect HRQoL. Fedratinib (FEDR) is an oral, selective inhibitor of JAK2 that was investigated in the randomized, placebo (PBO)-controlled, phase III JAKARTA study in adult pts with intermediate- or high-risk primary or secondary MF and no prior ruxolitinib exposure. Here we report the effect of FEDR 400 mg (starting dose) vs . PBO on pt-reported MF-associated symptoms and HRQoL in the JAKARTA study. Methods: Pt-reported symptoms were assessed daily during the week before day 1 of each cycle and at the end of cycle 6 (EOC6) using the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF), which comprises 6 key MF symptoms (night sweats, early satiety, pruritus, pain under ribs on the left side, abdominal discomfort, bone/muscle pain), each scored from 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable). Total symptom score (TSS), ranging from 0-60, was estimated by averaging daily TSS (sum of the individual symptom scores) during the week of each scheduled assessment. HRQoL was assessed at cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1) and EOC6 using the EuroQoL-5D 3-level (EQ-5D-3L), a generic, self-administered questionnaire with 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, pain, usual activities, anxiety/depression). Health utility scores were derived using UK population preferences, with a range from -0.594 to 1.0. A higher EQ-5D-3L utility score represents a better health state. All pts randomized to FEDR 400 mg/day or PBO with an evaluable assessment at BL (defined as available daily TSS on the MFSAF for \u22655 of 7 days in the week before C1D1; and non-missing values on the EQ-5D-3L at C1D1) were included in analyses. Cross-sectional assessment of changes from BL at post-BL visits was performed. Differences in mean changes from BL at post-BL visits between Tx groups were compared using a pooled 2-sample, 2-sided t-test. Effect sizes (95% confidence intervals [CI]) for between-group differences in mean changes from BL were also estimated using Hedges' g. Effect sizes between 0.2 (small) and 0.5 (medium) are a commonly used ballpark threshold for clinically meaningful differences between Tx groups. Responder analyses were performed using logistic regression, controlling for BL scores. On the MFSAF, symptom response was defined as a \u226550% reduction in TSS from BL. Pts with a TSS of 0 at BL were excluded from responder analyses. For EQ-5D-3L, a \u22650.08-point change from BL in health utility was used to define clinically meaningful improvement at EOC6. Pts with missing values at post-BL visits were considered non-responders in the responder analyses. Results : The MFSAF evaluable population comprised 91/96 FEDR 400 mg pts (95%) and 85/96 PBO pts (89%). BL characteristics were comparable between Tx arms. At BL, mean TSS was 17.6 and 14.7 for FEDR and PBO, respectively. Clinically meaningful and statistically significant between-group differences in favor of FEDR were generally observed for all individual MFSAF symptoms and across all visits (above medium effect size: night sweats, abdominal discomfort, early satiety, pain under ribs on left side; above small effect size: bone/muscle pain, pruritis). Mean TSS change significantly favored FEDR vs . PBO across all assessments, with clinically meaningful medium effect sizes ( Figure A ). Symptom response rate at EOC6 was significantly greater with FEDR (40.4%) than with PBO (8.6%)(odds ratio [OR] 6.97 [95%CI 2.87, 16.9]; P <0.001). Treatment benefit in favor of FEDR was similar across prespecified clinically relevant pt subgroups (see Figure B for selected key subgroups). EQ-5D-3L health utility scores at BL were similar between Tx arms (0.70 and 0.72 with FEDR and PBO, respectively). The difference in mean change from BL at EOC6 in EQ-5D-3L health utility was also clinically meaningful in favor of FEDR, with an effect size of 0.37 (95%CI 0.08, 0.66). The proportion of pts with clinically meaningful improvement in EQ-5D-3L health utility at EOC6 was significantly higher with FEDR, at 23.2% vs . 6.5% in the PBO arm (OR 5.12 [95%CI 1.81, 14.48]; P =0.002). Conclusions : FEDR 400 mg provided clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in TSS across the 6 MF-relevant symptoms, and broader HRQoL, as measured by health utility, vs . PBO in MF pts with no prior exposure to ruxolitinib. HRQoL benefits of FEDR were observed across clinically relevant pt subgroups, suggesting minimal heterogeneity of Tx effect.
