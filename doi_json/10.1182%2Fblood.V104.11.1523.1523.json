    "abstract_text": "Ninety patients with Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) where object of a phase II prospective multicentre study designed to evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerability of a two years treatment with PEG Interferon \u03b1-2b (PEG Intron, Schering Plough). The patients, 30 M and 60 F, 18\u201372 years old (median 45), observed in 16 Hematological Institutions of the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Mieloproliferative Croniche (GIMMC), received the ET diagnosis according to the PVSG criteria. At PEG Intron treatment start the patients showed: previous cytoreduction 97% (IFN \u03b1 31%), platelet count >1000 x 10 9 /L 81%, splenomegaly 22%. At the end of the first year The PEG Intron starting dose of 25 \u03bcg/week resulted increased to a mean value of 55 \u03bcg/week and the Hematological Response (HR = Plts <500x10 9 /L) was registered in 79% of the patients still on treatment. At the end of second year 65 patient still receiving PEG Intron (mean dose 31 \u03bcg/week) showed a maintenance of the HR (66%), a Partial Response (17%) and a Minor Response (17%). By utilizing the data included in the study CRFs we preliminarily evaluated the bone marrow biopsy and aspirate both performed at baseline, after 1 and 2 years in 89 and 86, 79 and 67, 57 and 50 patients, respectively. Data concerning the bone marrow biopsies after 1 year of treatment are reported:  BONE MARROW BIOPSY . BASELINE % . 1 YR % . 2 YRS % .

In conclusion, the present study shows that in ET patients a two years PEG Intron treatment, able to induce and to maintain the Hematological Response in the majority of cases, is associated to a decrease of bone marrow cellularity, granulopoiesis, erytropoiesis, MK number, size and ploidy and, moreover, with an increase of MK dystrophy and of bone marrow fibrosis. These preliminary data on bone biopsy and aspirate will be object of a planned centralized reevaluation by a Panel of Pathologists and Clinicians.",
