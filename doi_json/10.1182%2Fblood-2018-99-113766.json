    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Myeloid malignancies are heterogenous diseases caused by excessive accumulation of apparently myeloid clone of cells. Genomic studies on myeloid malignancies in recent years have identified new genetic alterations with biological and clinical significance. In addition to cytogenetics and morphological examination these genetic mutation play an important role in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of the patient. We assessed the frequency and clinicopathologic significance of 54 genes in myeloid neoplasm patients by using targeted next-generation sequencing. Methods: About 50 samples were collected from OPD at National Institute of Blood Diseases (NIBD), that consisting of 17 MDS, 18 AML and other myeloid neoplasms. They comprises of 33 males and 17 females with median age of 33 years (range: 5-69 years). The myeloid sequencing panel of 54 genes (complete coding exons of 15 genes and exonic hotspots of 39 genes) was sequenced. The panel total coverage was 141 kb in genomic sequence. TruSight myeloid sequencing (Illumina, CA) libraries were prepared and runs were performed on a MiSeq (Illumina) genome sequencer. The generated data were analyzed by on-instrument software or TruSeq Amplicon \u00ae and BaseSpace Apps \u00ae . Results: Overall 3092 variants were identified, after excluding intronic and synonymous variants, 380 missense variants were found in 50 patients. Around 38 mutations in 22 genes were identified in 23 out of 50 samples (46 %). The recurrent mutations found in RUNX1 , ASXL1 , GATA2 and CEPBA genes in our cohort. Conclusion: Most of the myeloid neoplasms are not easily manageable with limited treatment options. Therefore, targeted gene panel by next generation sequencing was an appropriate method for precise identification of mutations in myeloid neoplasms at our institution. Based on the obtained findings we will be able to design patient management plan with respect to individualize genetic mutations in the clinical setting.
