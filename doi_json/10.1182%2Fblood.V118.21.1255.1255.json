    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1255 Kindlins are a family of FERM domain proteins that are essential for inside-out integrin activation. In particular, kindlin-3 is required for the conversion of the major platelet integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 from its resting conformation to its active ligand binding conformation. Moreover, naturally-occurring kindlin-3 mutations result in the inherited disorder leukocyte adhesion deficiency III, one component of which is defective platelet function that mimics Glanzmann thrombasthenia. Despite the importance of kindlin-3 in initiating \u03b1IIb\u03b23 function in platelets, little is known about its regulation in resting platelets or its fate in activated platelets. To address these questions, we purified full-length kindlin-3 from outdated human platelets where it is present in substantial amounts and also developed a procedure to synthesize substantial amounts of recombinant kindlin-3 in SF9 cells. We found that in stored human platelets, kindlin-3 is cleaved into two fragments as a function of the time of storage. We also found that kindlin-3 is cleaved into identical fragments when fresh human platelets are stimulated with the thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) for 5 minutes. To identify the site of kindlin-3 cleavage, as well as the responsible protease, we used a proteomics method in which an engineered peptide ligase, subtiligase, was used to selectively biotinylate the unblocked \u03b1 amines of proteins obtained from platelet lysates (Mahrus et al, Cell 134:866\u201376, 2008). Biotinylated proteins were digested with trypsin and the resulting biotinylated peptide fragments were then captured using avidin agarose and identified using tandem mass spectrometry. Using this method, we identified the kindlin-3 peptide (G)SAPTDVLDSLTTIPELKDHL in lysates of stored platelets, thereby mapping the cleavage site to residues 335\u2013336. We obtained identical results using proteins isolated from TRAP-stimulated platelets. Further, we were able to recapitulate these results in vitro using purified kindlin-3 and the calcium-activated protease calpain, implying that calpain is the responsible protease in vivo . Kindlin-3 is thought to initiate \u03b1IIb\u03b23 function by binding to the distal NITY motif in the \u03b23 cytosolic tail in an interaction that also involves S752. Previously, we reported a model for \u03b1IIb\u03b23 regulation based on an NMR structure of the \u03b23 cytosolic tail (Metcalf et al, PNAS 107:24775\u201383, 2010). In this structure, the NITY motif is located in a distal dynamic amphiphilic helix where the motif is transiently masked by interacting with the membrane. To validate this model, we have studied the interaction of both purified and recombinant kindlin-3 with the \u03b23 tail using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). A peptide corresponding to \u03b23 residues 719\u2013762, encompassing the complete \u03b23 tail, was immobilized on a CM5 chip and kindlin-3 was flowed over the chip surface. The resulting sensorgrams could then be fit to two binding events with dissociation constants of 2.2 nM and 2.8 \u03bcM. The biphasic behavior could have resulted from heterogeneity of the \u03b23 tail on the chip surface or heterogeneity of the interaction between kindlin-3 and the carboxymethylated dextran. Similar SPR experiments measuring binding of the talin-1 FERM domain to the \u03b23 tail also could be fit to two binding events with dissociation constants of 155 nM and 3.5 \u03bcM. Thus, under these experimental conditions, kindlin-3 binds approximately 70-fold more tightly to the \u03b23 tail than does the talin-1 FERM domain. In summary, these studies demonstrate that kindlin-3 undergoes calpain-mediated endoproteolysis during platelet storage, an event that may contribute to the development of the platelet storage lesion. Kindlin-3 also undergoes an identical cleavage following platelet stimulation by agonists such as thrombin. Since high affinity binding of kindlin-3 to the \u03b23 cytosolic tail is required for physiologic \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation, it is possible that kindlin-3 cleavage attenuates \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activity.
