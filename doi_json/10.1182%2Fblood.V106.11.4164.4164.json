    "abstract_text": "Background: Both inherited and acquired thrombophilia predispose pregnant women to venous thromboembolism and recurrent fetal loss. The safety profile and tolerability of low molecular heparin (LWMH) has allowed us to evaluate effects of anticoagulation in the outcome of pregnancy in patients with thrombophilia. Methods: 20 patients with thrombophilia received either tinzaparin or enoxaparin combined with aspirin before and during pregnancy and the outcome of pregnancy was monitored for a period of 2 years. The median age of the patients was 28 years (25\u201349); 75% were Caucasians, 20% were aferican-american, 5% were others. The inherited and acquired thrombophilias include Factor V leiden mutation, prothrombin mutation in G20210A, mutation in methylenetetrahydrofolate (MTHFR), protein S deficiency, protein C deficiency, hyperhomocyteinemia, antiphospholipid syndrome, sticky platelet syndrome, etc. The majority of patients had more than 2 thrombophilia factors and had history of miscarriage. 15 of 20 patients (75%) received tinzaparin and 4 of 20 (20%) patients received enxoparin subcutaneously before they were conceived. Only one patient received unfractionated heparin. The LWMH was continued during pregnancy until 34 to 36 weeks gestation when it was changed to unfractionated heparin in order to prevent large amount of bleeding from upcoming delivery. All of the patients also received aspirin prior, during, and after the pregnancy. There were 21 live births including one triplet and one twins. Only two patients were complicated with miscarriage. There was no episode of severe bleeding or thromboembolism during pregnancy or postpartum. Conclusion: LWMH and aspirin has been effective in the prevention of fetal loss in women with thrombophilia disorders.",
