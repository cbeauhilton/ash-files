    "abstract_text": "Introduction NPM1 mutation is considered a founder genetic event of acute myeloid leukemia with NPM1 mutation ( NPM1mut -AML). Nonetheless, growing evidence of pre-existing genetic mutations and clonal hematopoiesis (clonal response) after intensive AML treatment in many patients is being generated, although the precise clinical impact of this genetic background is mostly unknown. Thus, the emergence of a wild-type NPM1 myeloid neoplasm ( NPM1wt -MN) after intensive chemotherapy treatment for NPM1mut -AML is a well-known phenomenon, but poorly described in long-term follow-up. Sequential genetic analysis with next generation sequencing (NGS) has the potential to elucidate the clonal origin of diverse emerging clinical scenarios occurring during clinical follow-up based on tracking of genetic evolution of clonal hematopoiesis status after AML treatment, as recently proposed (Hasserjian et al, Blood 2020). We aimed to analyze the incidence and clinico-biological characteristics of NPM1wt -MN emerging after treatment for NPM1mut -AML in a long-term follow-up series from a single institution. Patients and Methods We included in the study 62 patients diagnosed with NPM1mut AML patients and treated with intensive chemotherapy according to two consecutive protocols of the Spanish CETLAM cooperative group (CETLAM-2003 and -2012). Patients were diagnosed between 2005 and May 2019. NPM1wt -MN has been classified according to recent criteria proposed by Hasserjian et al, Blood 2020. Statistical analyses were performed using Rv3.1 and SPSS v20. Next generation targeted sequencing (NGS) was performed with Ion Ampliseq AML Research and Oncomine Myeloid Research Assay panel. Results The cohort included 62 patients (median age, 53 years, 25-73) with a median follow-up of alive patients of 44 months. After induction therapy, 58 patients (pt) achieved complete remission (CR) and 21 pt relapsed as NPM1mut -AML. Additionally, 9 pts (15%) developed a NPM1wt -MN: 4 (7%) presented a NPM1wt -AML relapse and 5 (8%) developed other NPM1wt -MN (non-AML NPM1wt -MN) that would be classified as residual myeloid neoplasm according to proposed criteria: 1 myelodysplastic syndrome, 3 myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic syndrome [2 CMML and 1 atypical chronic myeloid leukemia BCR-ABL negative (aCML)] and 1 polycythemia vera (PV) Characteristics of the 3 groups ( NPM1mut -AML, NPM1wt -AML, non-AML NPM1wt -MN) are shown in the Table. Median time from CR achievement to progression was longer in the group who developed a non-AML NPM1wt (24 vs 8 months; p=0.016), and an statistical trend of younger ager in pts with AML- NPM1mut group (48 vs 69 vs 60 years-old, respectively, p=0.056) and lower leucocyte count in pt presenting a non-AML NPM1wt -MN (5.5 vs 29 vs 50 x10 9 /L, respectively, p=0.065) were observed. Moreover, among 19 pts with available NGS at diagnosis, DNMT3A mutation was more frequently comutated in NPM1mut -AML (71% vs 0%vs 40%, respectively p=0.034) and SRSF2 was more frequently mutated in non-AML NPM1wt -MN (60% vs others (0%), p=0.01). Interestingly, outcome of patients presenting with AML relapse did not differ according to NPM1 status at relapse ( NPM1mut -AML vs. NPM1wt -AML), with a similar response rate after salvage chemotherapy (80% vs 75%, p=NS) and OS (5-year OS: 75\u00b140% vs 60\u00b120%; p=NS). NGS analysis of paired samples at diagnosis and emergent NPM1wt -MN in pts who lost NPM1 mutation at progression is detailed in Figure. Frequently persisting mutations were those usually found in clonal hematopoiesis such as DNA methylation (TET2, DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2), chromatin remodeling ASXL1, and splicing factor SRSF2, whereas FLT3 mutation was the most frequently lost at relapse. TP53, PTPN11,SETBP1, JAK2, IDH1 o ASXL1 were mutations gained at time of NPM1wt-MN emergence. Conclusions A proportion of pts with NPM1mut -AML will develop an NPM1 wild-type myeloid neoplasm after intensive chemotherapy-induced CR, emerging from preleukemic clonal hematopoiesis. Given this possible evolution, which can not be predicted by NPM1mut measurable residual disease monitoring, an active surveillance of these pts is recommended, including genetic re-testing at time of disease relapse or progression.
