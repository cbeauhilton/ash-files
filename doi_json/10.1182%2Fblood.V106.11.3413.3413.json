    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium (MMRC) has established a tissue bank for the deposition of bone marrow (BM) samples from patients with multiple myeloma (MM) to be mailed and processed under good laboratory practices (GLP). To date over 300 samples have been collected. The ability for multiple sites to utilize the same GLP protocols for isolation and storage of BM for batch testing can be cost prohibitive and can introduce derived variability. Currently, limited information is available on shipped BM aspirates in regards to cell viability, cell yield, cell purity, and subsequent RNA yield and quality. Materials and methods: To test these determinants we performed a pilot study on behalf of the MMRC where samples were drawn at Mayo Clinic Rochester (MCR) pooled and split into 2 equal aliquots. One-half of each sample was processed following the provided GLP compliant standard operating procedures (SOP\u2019s), immediately after sample procurement, at MCR. The CD138+ cells were stored in TRIZOL TM and the RNA was isolated and analyzed in a single batch. The other half of the aspirate was sent overnight to Mayo Clinic Scottsdale (MCS) where they were processed using an identical protocol. At both locations samples were tested for the following quality determinants; cell yield, RNA yield and integrity, and viability using a 3 color flow cytometric method (CD45, CD38 and 7ADD). Cell counts were performed on the CD138+ fraction to determine plasma cell recovery and a slide based immunofluorescent assay used to determine purity. RNA recovery and integrity were assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer TM . Lastly, gene expression profiles was compared to determine the \u201csignature\u201d emanating from the shipment of samples. Results: In aggregate, all quality determinants showed similar values when the two sets of samples were compared. Cell viability was similar in both sets of samples as was our ability to collect a highly enriched plasma cell population. The cell yield was very similar (r 2 =0.52) but slightly lower in the shipped samples (median 71% of locally processed, range 40\u2013140%), probably due to some shipment-associated apoptosis with subsequent loss of cell surface CD138 antigen. The purity of the shipped samples was very similar to that of locally processed (median 94%). Subjective qualitative analysis of the RNA was similar between both groups (shipped yield being 80% of local) with no evidence of degradation in the shipped samples. Details regarding the shipment signatures using gene expression profiling will be presented at the meeting. Conclusion: Here we show that the shipment of samples is feasible with no appreciable loss in cell yield or quality of derived products.  % APOPTOTIC+ DEAD . PC YIELD . PURITY (%) . RNA Recovered .
