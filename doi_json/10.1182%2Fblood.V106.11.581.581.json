    "abstract_text": "Although mature CD8+ T cells are known to be major effectors of acute GVHD, patients receiving T cell-depleted allografts remain at high risk for chronic GVHD. To what extent CD8+, CD4+ or both T cell subsets contribute to this chronic immunopathology is not known. We have recently demonstrated that alloreactive memory T cells develop in mice with acute GVHD and account for the persistence of host tissue injury ( Journal of Immunology , 2005 ; 174 : 3051 ). Based on these findings, we now ask whether de novo generated donor T cells from engrafted T-BM themselves contribute to persistent host tissue injury in GVHD. Confirming previous observations, we found that transplantation of lethally irradiated C57BL/6SJL (B6, CD45.1) mice with highly purified C3H.SW (CD45.2) CD4+ nai\u0308ve T cells did not cause GVHD, but mice receiving highly purified CD8+ nai\u0308ve T cells together with C3H.SW T-BM, suffered severe acute GVHD. Surprisingly, in these mice receiving only CD8+ T cells, a substantial number of donor CD4+ T cells as well as CD8+ T cells were detected in GVHD target tissues, indicating that these infiltrating CD4+ T cells had arisen de novo from the transplanted T-BM. Donor CD4+ T cells recovered from GVHD mice expressed surface markers of activated effector/effector memory T cells, including CD25, CD69, CXCR3, and CD44hiCD62Llo. In response to host DCs, purified GVHD CD4+ T cells proliferated and expanded 4-5X more, and produced 10X higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 than did CD4+ T cells derived from B6 mice receiving C3H.SW T-BM alone. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of these in vivo generated GVHD CD4+ T cells, without CD8+ T cells, into secondary irradiated B6 recipients induced clinical GVHD characterized by delayed onset, weight loss, diarrhea, and lymphopenia, but without cutaneous inflammation. Histologic examination demonstrated chronic inflammation in the liver and intestinal tract, including epithelial apoptosis. Thymic pathology was dramatic in secondary B6 recipients of GVHD CD4+ T cells, including thymic atrophy, loss of thymic cortex, and infiltration of large amount of tingible macrophages. Taken together, these results demonstrate that donor bone marrow derived, de novo generated CD4+ T cells also contribute to GVHD together with transferred mature CD8+ T cells. Moreover, they suggest that these CD4+ T cells, in concert with alloreactive memory CD8+ T cells that develop during the evolution of GVHD, cause the persistence of acute GVHD and its subsequent progression into chronic GVHD. Thus, donor BM-derived, de novo generated CD4+ T cells are the \u201cHidden Dragon\u201d of CD8+ T cell-mediated GVHD. Understanding how these CD4+ T cells are generated and regulated will prove to be critical to the prevention and treatment of both acute and chronic GVHD.",
