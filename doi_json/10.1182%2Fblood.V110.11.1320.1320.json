    "abstract_text": "Background: The Surveillance, Epidemiology & Risk Factors for TTP (SERF-TTP) study is the largest prospective cohort of idiopathic TTP cases to date. Methods: Patients with first episode of idiopathic TTP were enrolled at 11 sites in the US. Exclusion criteria include solid organ or allogeneic stem cell transplant, anti-neoplastic therapy or malignancy. All patients underwent therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). Remission is defined as platelet count >150,000/mm 3 . ADAMTS13 activity was measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay (FRETS-vWF73, Peptides Int.). ADAMTS13 inhibitor was assessed by ELISA (Technozym ADAMTS13 INH ELISA, Technoclone) and functional inhibition of normal ADAMTS13 activity (modified FRETS). Differences between the groups was evaluated by Chi-square test, t-test or Fisher\u2019s exact test. Results: Complete data is available for 57 cases. 84% were female & median age was 42. ADAMTS13 was severely deficient (50%) in 39%. Adverse events were frequent & most commonly include citrate toxicity and allergic reactions. Long-term followup was available for 56 patients, and overall relapse rate was 25% with median time to relapse of 11 months. The relapse rate was 41% in patients with severe ADAMST13 deficiency & 0% in patients with normal ADAMTS13 activity (p=0.0077). Conclusions: Severe ADAMTS13 deficiency does not define all cases of idiopathic TTP, yet is associated with a unique syndrome characterized by severe thrombocytopenia, normal renal function, presence of ADAMTS13 neutralizing autoantibodies & high risk of relapse. Non-ADAMTS13 deficient idiopathic TTP has clinical features similar to thrombotic microangiopathies associated with stem cell transplant or drugs such as quinine, yet has a better than expected overall survival after TPE. There is likely an alternate disease mechanism for this cohort, possibly immunologic, which may be responsive to TPE and warrants further study.  . ADAMTS13 < 10% n=30 .
