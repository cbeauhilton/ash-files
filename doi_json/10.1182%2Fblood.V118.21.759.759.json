    "abstract_text": "Abstract 759 We hypothesized that metabolic differences between leukemia initiating cells and their normal counterparts represent a vulnerability in the leukemia initiating cell, which can be therapeutically exploited. To test this hypothesis, we used the MLL-AF9 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model in mice. Actin-DsRed mouse bone marrow transduced with MLL-AF9 expressing retrovirus was used to produce serially transplantable leukemia. Leukemic granulocyte-monocyte precursors (L-GMPs), defined by others to be the leukemia initiating cells were flow sorted from secondary recipient mice and compared with normal GMPs (N-GMPs) from actin Ds-Red mice. Gene expression profiling, metabolomic profiling via liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry and an in vitro shRNA screen were used to identify metabolic pathways preferentially activated in leukemia initiating cells. Of 1574 defined metabolic enzymes, 44 were found to be differentially expressed between L-GMPs and their normal counterparts (N-GMPs). These together with 117 classic rate limiting enzymes were subjected to shRNA knockdown in vitro. Metabolomic profiling of both cell populations was used to corroborate findings from shRNA knockdowns. L-GMPs and N-GMPs were transduced with lentivirus expressing shRNAs of interest (5 shRNAs per gene) in a 384 well format, selected with puromycin and cultured for 72\u201396 hours in the presence of GFP-positive primary bone marrow stroma. The number of cells in each well at the end of this experiment was quantitated using an Image Xpress microscope. Genes, the knockdown of which by at least two independent shRNAs produced a two fold or more decrease in L-GMPs as compared to control wells and did not similarly decrease N-GMPs, were chosen for in vivo validation. Ten genes in the glycolysis pathway and TCA cycle, fatty acid metabolism and detoxification, and ketohexokinase were identified. Ketohexokinase, a rate-limiting enzyme in fructose metabolism was particularly potent and of interest given its potential to be exploited therapeutically. In vivo assessment of its relative ability to inhibit malignant versus normal hematopoietic cells is ongoing. These studies provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that specific metabolic circuits are differentially active in leukemia initiating cells in MLL-AF9 AML and may represent unique points of vulnerability that can be targeted therapeutically.
