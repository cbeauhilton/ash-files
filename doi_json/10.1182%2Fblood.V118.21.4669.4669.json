The \u20184Ts\u2019 HIT score (with 4 domains: T hrombocytopenia, T iming of thrombocytopenia, T hrombosis and o T her reason for thrombocytopenia) might reliably identify patients at low risk of HIT. Agreement on 4Ts scoring is uncertain in this setting. Objective: To compare 4Ts HIT scores among research coordinators (who scored real-time), and 2 adjudicators (who scored retrospectively, independently) during an international heparin thromboprophylaxis trial. Methods: 763 of 3746 medical-surgical ICU patients in PROTECT met enrolment criteria in this HIT substudy, if any of the following occurred: platelets <50\u00d710 9 /L, platelets decreased to 50% of ICU admission value, venous thrombosis, or if HIT was otherwise clinically suspected. Persons independently completed 4Ts scores blinded to all laboratory HIT results and each others' scores. 475 of these patients had a central or local laboratory HIT test performed and had 4Ts scoring by adjudicators; 432 were scored by research coordinators. Results: Most patients (410, 86.3%) had a 4Ts score \u22643 conferring a low pretest probability (PTP) of HIT whereas 57 (12.0%) had a moderate PTP, and 8 (1.7%) had a high PTP, as determined by adjudicator consensus. Raw agreement on the 4Ts score was good for central adjudicators overall; however, agreement between adjudicated consensus scores and real time research coordinator scores was not as high. 4Ts agreement (raw and chance-corrected) is presented below.  .

The fourth domain of 4Ts (o T her causes of thrombocytopenia) generated the most disagreement. Further studies of 4Ts scoring by bedside clinicians is needed.
