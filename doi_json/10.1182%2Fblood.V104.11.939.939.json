    "abstract_text": "Suppression of polyclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) synthesis is one feature of multiple myeloma (MM). To evaluate if recovery of polyclonal Ig synthesis after autologous stem cell transplantation (ABSCT) influences prognosis, we have retrospectively analyzed the prognostic value of clinical and laboratory variables of 348 multiple myeloma patients who underwent their first autologous stem cell transplantation between 06.1992 and 10.2002 at the University Hospital of Heidelberg. The median follow-up was 34 months (range, 3 to 136 months). The median number of chemotherapy courses prior to first ABSCT was 5 (range, 3 to 30). Twenty-two of 348 patients underwent altogether three ABSCTs (including 18 patients with tandem transplantations), 141 had two ABSCTs (including 87 tandem transplantations) and 29 patients were treated with allogeneic transplantation as second line treatment. Recovery of polyclonal Ig synthesis was studied by serumelectrophoresis on day 100 after first ABSCT (\u00b130 days). Full polyclonal Ig recovery was observed in 93 of 348 patients (28%), partial recovery (reduced polyclonal Ig, no monoclonal Ig) in 58 (17%), no recovery (almost no polyclonal Ig and no monoclonal Ig) in 16 (5%), polyclonal Ig recovery associated with monoclonal Ig in 95 (27%) and monoclonal Ig without polyclonal Ig in 72 patients (21%) (data missing in 14 patients (4%)). On multivariate analysis (333 patients), using Cox proportional hazards regression model stratified with respect to tandem transplantation, superior event-free survival was observed with recovery of polyclonal Ig synthesis, low beta2-microglobulin at diagnosis (<2.5mg/L) and a high haemoglobin at diagnosis, whereas MM type IgA and a high number of chemotherapy courses prior to first ABSCT were identified as adverse prognostic factors. Regarding polyclonal recovery, patients with polyclonal Ig recovery associated with monoclonal Ig had a superior event-free survival compared to patients with only monoclonal Ig without any polyclonal Ig recovery. Overall survival was superior in patients with a low \u03b2 2 -microglobulin at diagnosis (<2.5mg/L) and a high haemoglobin at diagnosis, and worse in patients with a high number of chemotherapy courses prior to first ABSCT. We conclude that any recovery of polyclonal Ig synthesis even when associated with monoclonal Ig, improves event-free survival, and therefore can be used as a predictor of prognosis in the follow-up of multiple myeloma patients who underwent ABSCT.",
