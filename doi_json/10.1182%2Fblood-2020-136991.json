    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of monoclonal plasma cells accumulating in the bone marrow. The critical influence of tumor-infiltrating T cells on disease control and therapeutic responses has been shown in a variety of malignancies, however, the role of multiple myeloma bone marrow-infiltrating T cells is incompletely understood. Although it has been shown that multiple myeloma neo-antigen-specific T cells can be expanded in vitro , little is known about functions and specificities of clonally expanded multiple myeloma-infiltrating bone marrow T cells. Here we asked at the single cell level whether clonally expanded T cells i) were detectable in multiple myeloma bone marrow and peripheral blood, ii) showed characteristic immune phenotypes, and iii) recognized antigens selectively presented on multiple myeloma cells. A total of 6,744 single bone marrow T cells from 13 treatment-na\u00efve patients were index-sorted and sequenced using our methodologies for determination of paired T cell receptor (TCR) \u03b1\u03b2 sequences along with immune phenotype, transcription factor and cytokine expression. Clonal T cell expansion occurred predominantly within the CD8 + compartment. Phenotypes of clonally expanded T cells were distinctive of cytolytic effector differentiation and significantly different from non-expanded CD8 + T cells. Less than 25% of expanded CD8 + T cell clones expressed the immune checkpoint molecules programmed death-1 (PD-1), cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), or T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3), while B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) was expressed on more than half of the expanded clones. Clonal T cell expansion did not correlate with neo-antigen load as determined by whole exome and RNA sequencing of purified multiple myeloma cells. Furthermore, peripheral blood TCR\u03b2 repertoire sequencing from five selected patients with substantial bone marrow T cell expansion identified 90% of expanded bone marrow T cell clones overlapping with peripheral blood. To determine whether clonally expanded bone marrow T cells recognized antigens selectively presented on multiple myeloma cells, 71 dominant TCRs from five selected patients with substantial clonal T cell expansion were re-expressed in 58\u03b1 - \u03b2 - T-hybridoma reporter T cells and co-incubated with CD38-enriched multiple myeloma cells from the same patients. Only one of these TCRs recognized antigens selectively presented on multiple myeloma cells and this TCR was not neo-antigen-specific. Hypothesizing that the target antigen was a non-mutated self-antigen, we could show that this TCR also recognized the plasma cell leukemia cell line U-266 in an HLA-A*02:01-restricted manner. In summary, clonally expanded T cells in multiple myeloma bone marrow of newly diagnosed patients show cytolytic effector differentiation. In the majority of patients, clonally expanded bone marrow T cells do not recognize antigens presented on multiple myeloma cells and are not neo-antigen-specific. Our findings are relevant for the design of future therapeutics and clinical trials. The identified TCR, which recognizes a multiple myeloma antigen shared with U-266 in an HLA-A*02:01-restricted manner, could be a promising candidate for T cell therapy.
