    "abstract_text": "Introduction \u03b22-glycoproteinI (\u03b22GPI) is the primary antigen for antiphospholipid antibodies (Ab), and Ab to \u03b22GPI are associated with thrombosis and recurrent fetal loss.\u03b22GPIis comprised of 5 \"sushi\" domains. Complex disulfide bonding renders \u03b22GPI a challenging protein to producerecombinantlyin high yield and most studies have utilized domain-deletion mutants produced on a lab scale for structure-function analyses.\u03b22GPIalso has a complex tertiary structure, and is reported to circulate in a \"circular\" form that may \"open\" to expose the antigenic site for \u03b22GPIAbunder specific conditions. We developed a novel method to produce recombinant \u03b22GPI in which replacement of the leader peptide allows large scale expression using a lentiviral system with one-step purification on heparin-sepharose. The ability of this protein to bind anti-\u03b22GPI Ab was compared with that of plasma-derived (wild type, WT) \u03b22GPI. Methods \u03b22GPIcDNAwas cloned into pLentiCMV DEST. The \u03b22GPI containing vector was used to transduce HEK293 cells with selection using puromycin. \u03b22GPIwas purified from conditioned medium using HiTrapHeparin HP. Plasma \u03b22GPI was purified using a protocol employing perchloric acid precipitation followed by heparin-sepharose and Mono-S chromatography. To measure anti-\u03b22GPI Ab, we analyzed plasma from 32 patients referred to the Cleveland Clinic Special Coagulation Laboratory for anti-\u03b22GPI testing using the InovaQuanta-Lite ELISA. Normal plasma samples (n=15) were also analyzed at 1:100 dilution to determine cutoffs for anti-\u03b22GPI positivity. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4\u00b0 C with 2 \u00b5g/ml WT or recombinant \u03b22GPI. After blocking \u03b22GPI-coated plates with BSA , 50 \u00b5l of patient plasma at 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions were added to individual wells in quadruplicate. A standard curve for IgG binding to each plate was created using affinity-purified rabbit anti-\u03b22GPI IgG at concentrations of 15, 31.25, 62.5, 125, and 250 ng/ml. After incubation for 30 minutes at room temperature, plates were washed three times and 100 \u00b5l of a 1:5000 dilution of goat anti-human IgG was added. After 30 minutes, wells were again washed prior to adding 100 \u00b5l/well of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride. Plates were read at 490 nm after 15 minutes following addition of 25 \u00b5l/well H 2 SO4. Results from different plates were standardized by extrapolating the amount of boundAb from the standard curve prepared on each plate. To compare performance of recombinant \u03b22GPI against WT \u03b22GPI in ELISA we first evaluated correlation using recombinant and WT \u03b22GPI by Spearman's test. The two sets of ELISAs were also compared using the Wilcoxon matched pairs test. ELISA readings were considered positive if they were >90 th percentile on a curve established using 15 normal plasmas. Sensitivity and specificity of the assays was determined with respect to the results of the clinical assay. Results Recombinant \u03b22GPI was produced in high yield (10-20 mg/L) and purified to homogeneity with a single heparin chromatography step; the purified protein migrated as a single band of ~50 kDon SDS-PAGE with a characteristic increase in M r upon reduction. Anti-\u03b22GPI IgG ELISA using WT and recombinant \u03b22GPI demonstrated excellent correlation at both 1:10 (Spearman's rho 0.70, P<0.001) and 1:100 dilution (Spearman rho 0.727, p<0.001) (Figure 1). Using the Wilcoxon test for paired samples, there was no significant difference between results of the ELISA using WT or recombinant \u03b22GPI at 1:10 dilution (mean difference 4.26 \u00b1 22.25, P<0.001) and a small difference at 1:100 dilution (mean difference 13.51 \u00b17.59, P <0.001) (Figure 2). Of the 32 patient samples, 6 were known positive for anti-\u03b22GPI IgG (titer \u2265 20 GPL). Using a 90 th percentile cutoff established using healthy volunteer samples, theELISA using recombinant \u03b22GPI correctly identified 6/6 positive samples (sensitivity 100%). The ELISA using plasma-derived \u03b22GPI correctly identified 5/6 positive samples (sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 84%). Conclusion Recombinant \u03b22GPI can be produced in high yield by this novel method and purified with a single heparin chromatography step. It is recognized by anti-\u03b22GPI Abat least as well as WT \u03b22GPI. Further studies focused on site-directed mutagenesis of the intact molecule to optimize assays for detection of pathologic anti-\u03b22GPI antibodies are underway.
