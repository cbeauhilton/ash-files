    "abstract_text": "Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is characterized by the presence of low numbers of circulating clonal B cells that usually display highly-similar phenotypic features to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. This entity is divided into high-count (MBL hi ) and low-count (MBL lo ), depending on the number of peripheral blood (PB) clonal B cells (higher vs. lower than 0.5x10 9 /L, respectively). Whereas MBL hi is frequently detected in laboratory routine analyses and precedes CLL, MBL lo is mainly detected in population-based screening studies, making its biological and clinical significance elusive. Of note, prevalence of MBL lo is significantly higher than that of MBL hi and CLL, and increases with age, with a prevalence >20% among individuals older than 70y. Here, we re-evaluated 65/91 MBL lo subjects (54 CLL-like and 11 non-CLL-like) followed-up for >5 years (median of 7 years), using high-sensitivity flow cytometry. Cytogenetic alterations related to CLL (i.e. del13q14, trisomy 12, del11(q22-q23) and del17p13) and other chronic B-cell tumors were studied by iFISH in purified MBL clonal B cells. Overall, the clone size significantly increased (median of 2-3-fold) in 69% of MBL lo cases, but only one subject progressed to MBL hi . In parallel, the frequency of cytogenetic alterations increased over time (32% vs. 61% of cases at baseline and at follow-up, respectively). The absolute number of the major T- and NK-cell populations was also increased, but only among CLL-like cases with increased clone size. To prevent a potential age-related bias and to further confirm these findings, we compared the number of PB normal lymphocyte subsets in CLL-like MBL lo subjects vs . a large series of age- and gender-matched non-MBL healthy donors. Although progression to CLL was not observed, overall survival of MBL lo subjects was significantly reduced vs. non-MBL controls studied in parallel (P=0.03) plus the general population from the same region (P\u22640.001), particularly among females (P=0.01); infection and cancer, were the main causes of death in MBL lo . In summary, despite mid-term progression from MBL lo to MBL hi and CLL appears to be unlikely, MBL lo clones persist at increased numbers usually carrying more genetic alterations, in association with higher-risk of death in comparison with healthy individuals, particularly among females.
