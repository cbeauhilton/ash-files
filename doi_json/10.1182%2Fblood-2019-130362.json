    "abstract_text": "Background: Mutations in IDH2 occur in 8-19% of patients (pts) with AML. Enasidenib (ENA; AG-221) is an oral, small-molecule inhibitor of mutant IDH2 (mIDH2) that promotes myeloid cell differentiation. ENA is approved in the US for use in adult pts with relapsed/refractory m IDH2 AML. Azacitidine (AZA) is a hypomethylating agent that prolongs survival vs . conventional care regimens in older unfit pts with newly diagnosed (ND) AML. AZA promotes DNA hypomethylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases. ENA indirectly reduces DNA methylation by suppressing the oncometabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), thereby restoring function to \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent TET family enzymes, among other substrates. In vitro , combination ENA + AZA enhances cell differentiation. This is the first report of interim outcomes from the randomized, phase II portion of an ongoing, open-label, phase I/II study of ENA + AZA vs. AZA monotherapy (AZA-only) in pts with m IDH2 ND-AML who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy (IC) (NCT02677922). Methods : Adult pts with m IDH2 ND-AML who were ineligible to receive IC and had ECOG PS scores \u22642 were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive ENA + AZA or AZA-only in repeated 28-day cycles. All pts receive SC AZA 75 mg/m 2 /day for the first 7 days of each treatment (Tx) cycle; pts randomized to ENA + AZA also receive continuous ENA 100 mg QD. The primary endpoint is overall response rate (ORR), which includes complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete blood or platelet count recovery (CRi/CRp), partial remission (PR), and morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS), per modified IWG 2003 AML response criteria. P values for response comparisons between Tx arms were derived using chi-square test. Duration of response (DOR) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. m IDH2 variant allele frequencies (VAF) in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) were assessed by digital PCR. Results : Between Oct. 2016 and Aug. 2018, 101 pts were randomized to receive ENA + AZA (n=68) or AZA-only (n=33). Median ages were 74 years (range 62-85) in the ENA + AZA arm and 75 years (57-85) in the AZA-only arm. Among pts with available data, 78% in the ENA + AZA arm (43/55) and 90% (19/21) in the AZA-only arm had intermediate-risk cytogenetics, respectively, and 18% and 10% had poor-risk cytogenetics. At data cutoff (Feb. 2019), 39 pts were still receiving their randomized Tx. Most common reasons for study discontinuation in the ENA + AZA and AZA-only arms were death (31% and 27%, respectively) and pt decision (4% and 12%). Two pts in the ENA + AZA arm and 1 pt in the AZA-only arm proceeded to transplant. Median number of Tx cycles was 8 (range 1-24) in the ENA + AZA arm and 6 (1-22) in the AZA-only arm; 27% and 19% of pts, respectively, received \u226512 Tx cycles. Response rates were significantly higher with combination treatment vs. AZA alone: ORRs were 68% vs . 42%, respectively ( P =0.0155), and CR rates were 50% vs . 12% ( P =0.0002) ( Table ). Median DOR was not reached with ENA + AZA and was 10.2 months in the AZA-only arm ( P =0.13). Maximal m IDH2 VAF suppression from baseline was significantly greater with ENA + AZA vs . AZA-only (median -69.3% vs. -14.1%, respectively; P =0.0004). Tx-related grade 3-4 adverse events occurring in \u226510% of pts in the combination arm were neutropenia (34%), thrombocytopenia (34%), anemia (21%), febrile neutropenia (12%), and IDH differentiation syndrome (IDH-DS; 10%); these events occurred in 19%, 19%, 22%, 13%, and 0% of pts in the AZA-only arm. Rate of Tx-related grade 3-4 infections was 16% in the ENA + AZA arm and 31% in the AZA-only arm. In all, 12 pts (18%) in the ENA + AZA arm experienced IDH-DS (any grade) at a median of 37 days. In the first 60 days, 5 deaths (7%) were reported in the ENA + AZA arm (3 due to infectious complications and 2 due to possible IDH-DS) and 1 death (3%) was reported in the AZA-only arm due to progressive disease. Conclusions : ENA + AZA was associated with significantly improved complete remission and overall response rates and significant m IDH2 VAF reductions compared with AZA-only. Combination Tx was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that reported for either monotherapy. An updated data cutoff that includes at least 1 year of follow-up for all pts will be presented at the conference. Updated data will include overall survival, event-free survival, and comprehensive analyses of 2-HG and co-mutation dynamics.
