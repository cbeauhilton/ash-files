    "abstract_text": "Background: Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a refractory peripheral T-cell malignancy caused by human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. Although only allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) displaying the graft-vs. ATL (GvATL) can bring durable remission, allo-HSCT is largely ineligible for newly diagnosed ATL patients due to disease aggressiveness and advanced age-related conditions. Thus, a novel treatment with safety and efficacy instead of allo-HSCT still remains an unmet need, and a cellular immunotherapy using TCR or CAR gene-modified immune cells exerting GvATL could be such an option. However, to generate those effector cells from autologous T cells of heavily pre-treated ATL patients faces many obstacles. To circumvent those hurdles, an employment of unconventional allogeneic V\u03b39/\u03b42-T cells which are potentially free from the risk of GVHD could provide greater treatment opportunity for ATL patients due to highly extended donor availability. Taking above, here, we have newly devised an adoptive immunotherapy using a novel HTLV-1 p40Tax-specific TCR gene-modified allogeneic V\u03b39/\u03b42 T cells against ATL. Methods: After written informed conscent, we firstly established novel HLA-A24 restricted TCR-\u03b1/\u03b2 genes from HTLV-1 P40Tax 301-309 (SFHSLHLLF)/HLA-A24 tetramer-positive peripheral CD8 + T-lymphocytes of ATL patinets in durable remission using a single cell cloning method. Then, we confirmed that T cells gene-modified with these TCR-\u03b1/\u03b2 genes exerted the epitope-specific and HLA-A24-restricted responses. Next, in order to achieve highly stable expression of this TCR-\u03b1/\u03b2 heterodimer on gene-modified V\u03b39/\u03b42-T cells, we newly developed a retroviral vector co-expressing TCR-\u03b1/\u03b2 and CD8 \u03b1/\u03b2 genes using self-cleaving P2A and E2A peptides. Using this vector, allogeneic V\u03b39/\u03b42-T cells from healthy donors numerously expanded with high purity in our novel culture system were subjected to gene-transfer to express relevant TCR \u03b1/\u03b2 complex. Thereafter, we asssessed target-reactive cytokine production and cytocidal activity mediated by those gene-modified allogeneic V\u03b39/\u03b42-T cells both in vitro and in vivo . Finally, we additionally assessed a potential risk of GVHD using intravenous administration of another TCR gene-modified V\u03b39/\u03b42 T-cells in vivo . Results: To start with PBMCs from healthy donors, allogeneic V\u03b39/\u03b42-T cells were stably multiplied greater than thousandfold with a quite high purity (\u226595%) using our novel bisphosphonate derivative PTA (tetrakis-pivaloyloxymethyl2-(thiazole-2-ylamino) ethylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate) combined with both 25 ng/ml of IL-7 and IL-15 in culture for 8 to 10 days. The stable expression of introduced TCR \u03b1/\u03b2 heterodimer on V\u03b39/\u03b42-T cells were successfully achieved by co-expression of CD8 \u03b1/\u03b2 molecule. Those gene-modified V\u03b39/\u03b42-T cells successfully recognized target peptide (SFHSLHLLF) in an HLA-A24 restricted fashion, and similarly demonstrated a cytocidal activity both in vitro and in vivo against HLA-A24 positive HTLV-1 infected cell lines (TL-Su and ILT#Hod), but not HLA-A24-negtive/Tax-positive cell line ILT#37 or HLA-A24-positve/Tax-negative cell line ATN-1. Furthermore, intravenously administered those TCR gene-modified V\u03b39/\u03b42-T cells quickly and durably eradicated luciferase-gene modified TL-Su cells, but not ATN-1 cells in xenografted immunodeficient (NOG) mice, examined by in vivo imaging system. Finally, infused HLA-A2 restricted and NY-ESO-1 specific TCR (G50) gene-modified V\u03b39/\u03b42-T cells exerted durable antitumor activity without causing GVHD using NOG mice xenografted with HLA-A2 positive melanoma cell line cells (NW-MEL-38). Conclusions: Our preclinical observations here obviously demonstrated the potential utility of TCR-\u03b1/\u03b2 gene-modified allogeneic V\u03b39/\u03b42-T cells for the treatment of ATL without causing GVHD. Further studies regarding biological behaviors of HTLV-1 Tax specific TCR-\u03b1/\u03b2 gene-modified allogeneic V\u03b39/\u03b42-T cells following target recognition in vivo are warranted, however, based on these lines of evidence and currently conducting assessments using clinical samples, we are planning to launch a novel clinical trial, particularly focusing on the applicability of HLA partially matched relative donors, as the source of gene-modified allogeneic V\u03b39/\u03b42-T cells, which could highly extend the donor availability.
