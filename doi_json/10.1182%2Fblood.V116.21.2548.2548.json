    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2548 Background: The effectiveness of allogeneic NST in CLL has been attributed to a graft-versus-leukemia effect due to elimination of tumor cells by alloimmune effector lymphocytes. In a previous study (Khouri et al, Exp Hematol 2004), we found that when patients with CLL develop relapse after NST, immunomanipulation (IMM) via withdrawal of immunosuppression and DLI with rituximab can induce sustained remissions in some patients. The underlying mechanism of this GVL effect is unknown. The simultaneous presence of the killer-immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 3DL1 and its corresponding human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I ligands bearing the Bw4 epitope has been described in CLL (Verheyden S, Leukemia 2006). Purpose: Considering that the HLA class I molecules may act as restriction elements for GVL targets after NST in CLL, we investigated the potential association of certain common class I HLA alleles and response to IMM. Methods: We studied all 43 CLL pts who required IMM after NST in sequential phase II protocols at the U.T. MD Anderson Cancer Center from February 1996 to August 2007 because of persistent disease or because of progression. In our analysis, we examined the most common alleles and serotypes expressed in the patients studied. This included HLA- A1, A2, A3, A24, B7, B8, B35, B44, B60, B62, BW4, BW6, CW7. These allele groups are known to be common in most world populations. Rituximab was given at a dose of 375 mg/m 2 intravenously followed by 3 weekly doses of 1000 mg/m 2 . A DLI of 1 \u00d7 10 7 CD3-positive T cells/kg was given after the first two doses of rituximab if no GVHD occurred. An escalated DLI dose was given at 6-week intervals if there was persistent active disease and no GVHD. Results: Median age (range) was 55 years (39-73) and the median Hematopoietic Stem Cell Comorbidity Index was 3 (range, 0\u20138). The median number of prior chemotherapies was 3. At their transplant, 48% of pts had refractory disease, 90% had Binet stage B/C, and 60% had a beta-2 microglobulin of =/> 3. P53 deletion was detected in 11 of 35 pts (31%) tested. Mixed T-cell chimerism was observed in 60 % of pts at day 90. The median number of DLI infused was 2 (range, 1\u20136); their median maximal dose was 43.6 (range, 1\u2013200) \u00d7 10 6 CD3+/Kg. In these 43 pts, 20 (47%) experienced complete remission (CR), by CT scans, marrow and flow analysis. Pts characteristics at time of study entry (described above) for NST, and at the time of initiation of IMM (this included white blood cell counts, LDH, % lymphocyte in marrow, % CD5-CD19, lymph node size by computed tomography, maximum dose DLI, number of DLIs, GVHD prior IMM and grade, T-cell chimerism), as well as HLA subtypes were assessed. The major determinants to achieve CR following IMM included receipt of a PBSC graft and achievement of a good (> 90%) donor T-cell chimerism at day 90 (p = 0.035), and having a combination of HLA-A1-positive, HLA-A2-negative, and HLA-B44-negative (p= 0.0009). The rate of CR to IMM was 9%, 36%, 50%, 91% respectively in patients who had none of the HLA factors described, I, 2, and all 3 respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in pts and disease characteristics between HLA-A1-positive or negative, HLA-A2 positive or negative nor between HLA-B44-positive or negative pts. In addition the risks of acute II-IV [Cumulative incidence (CI)=23%) and chronic GVHD (CI=69%) were not different between the respective subtypes. With a median follow-up in surviving pts of 37.2 months (range, 11.4\u2013131.1), the progression-free survival rates at 5-year for patients with HLA-A1+/A2-/B44- vs those who had none of those HLA types were 68% vs 15%, respectively, (p<0.0001). Conclusions: Our results represent the first report showing certain HLA alleles might be predictive for response to GVL and achieving long-term remission in CLL. Verification of our findings in a larger cohort of pts is highly warranted for better selecting pts for IMM for the treatment of recurrent malignancy in CLL.
