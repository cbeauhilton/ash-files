    "abstract_text": "Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a drug-dependent immune disorder caused by autoantibodies to Platelet Factor 4 (PF4) and heparin. The immune basis of HIT is poorly understood. Recent studies describing transient antibody responses and absence of immunologic memory in HIT suggest that PF4/heparin autoantibodies may develop independently of T cell help. To investigate the cellular basis of the HIT immune response, we have developed a murine autoimmune model in which anti-murine PF4/heparin (anti-mP+H) arise de novo . Cohorts of BALB/c mice were immunized daily either intravenously (IV, n=10) or intraperitoneally (IP, n=10) for five days with complexes of murine (m) PF4/heparin (IV, n=5 or IP, n=5), heparin alone (IV, n= 2) or buffer (IV, n=3 or IP, n=5). Mice were screened for anti-mP+H for four weeks after immunization using a murine PF4/heparin ELISA. Peak antibody responses to antigen were seen at 11\u201315 days in 2/5 mice injected with IV mP+H (Day 11, mouse IV P+H #0 peak A 450nm =0.34\u00b10.01; Day15 mouse IV P+H #2 peak A 450nm =0.69\u00b10.01), and at days 22\u201325 in 2/5 mice injected by IP route (Day 22, mouse IP P+H #0 peak A 450nm =0.37\u00b10.01; Day 25 mouse IP P+H #2 peak A 450nm =0.78\u00b10.02). Anti-mP+H were not detected in mice injected with heparin alone or buffer alone at any time point (peak maximum IV A 450nm = 0.1\u00b10.001, Control #2; mouse IP P+H Control #2 A 450nm =0.04\u00b10.002). Serologically, murine autoantibodies were similar to anti-human (h) PF4/heparin. Anti-mP+H reactivity was specific for murine antigen (mouse IV P+H #2 A 450nm =0.65\u00b10.06), and was reduced with antigen in the presence of excess heparin (A 450nm =0.38\u00b10.01). Minimal reactivity was seen with wells coated with hP+H (A 450nm =0.09\u00b10.005), albumin (mouse IV P+H #2 A 450nm =0.15\u00b10.03), or PBS alone (mouse IV P+H #2 A 450nm =0.16\u00b10.01). Similar to human HIT antibodies, anti-mP+H were of IgG 1 subclass. To determine if T cells are required for development of anti-mP+H, mice lacking T cell function (BIG:BALB/c-Nu, n=10) were injected IV with mP+H daily for five days. Unlike euthymic mice, nude mice did not manifest any antibody responses to IV injections of mP+H. In summary, we have developed a novel murine autoimmune model of anti-PF4/heparin that recapitulates many salient features of the human immune syndrome. Using this murine model, we demonstrate that T cells are essential for development PF4/heparin autoantibodies. Studies are currently underway to delineate mechanisms of T cell regulation and peripheral tolerance in HIT."
