    "abstract_text": "Correlative laboratory studies were developed in a phase I trial to evaluate the safety of intracoronary injection of escalating doses of bone marrow (BM) CD133+ cells in patients with chronic coronary ischemia. Concurrent with patient cellular therapy, CD133+ cells were phenotyped and tested functionally with endothelial cell colony formation and in vitro and in vivo transmigration. BM (194 \u00b1 11 ml) was isolated from patients meeting study inclusion criteria. CD133+ cells (20 \u00b1 13 x 10 6 , 84 \u00b1 7% purity and 76 \u00b1 7% viability (7AAD)) were isolated using the CliniMACS device (Miltenyi). Contaminating cells following the CliniMACS selection were: < 5% of CD3, CD3 neg /CD56, CD19 (immature/mature), CD14, and CD71 cells with 5% CD61, 8% CD13+ SSC high . BM, PB (peripheral blood), cord blood (CB)-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) were assessed by a culture assay (StemCell Technologies) scoring early outgrowth CFU-EC. SEACOAST patients yielded significantly less colonies compared to controls of matched PB and BM (donors 28\u201348 yrs) and CB: normal donor (ND) PB, 65; ND BM, 40; CB, 43; SEACOAST patient PB, 2, SEACOAST patient BM, 1. Transmigration assays were used to evaluate the functionality of selected CD133+ cells to chemotactic agents stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Selected CD133+ cells were recovered, resuspended in DMEM/1% HSA media and after a 37\u00b0C incubation for 16\u201320 hrs, 5 x 10 4 CD133+ cells were added to transwells (5 mm) for 3 hours. Transmigrated cells were quantitated by flow cytometry using anti-CD45, anti-CD133 antibodies, and Fluorosphere beads. Surface expression on ND BM CD133+ cells of CXCR4 and VEGF-R2 was 0\u201316.4% and 1.2\u20134.3%, respectively. Transmigration was effected by 200 ng/ml (range of 16\u201362%) but not to 10 ng/ml VEGF. For CD133+ cells devoid of the expression of CXCR4, SDF-1-induced transmigration was absent. Expression of CXCR4 and VEGF-R2 on clinical trial patient-selected CD133+ cells was 0\u20135% and 0\u20132%, respectively, and transmigration was 5\u201319% to 200 ng/ml SDF-1 but not to 10 ng/ml VEGF. Patient selected CD133+ cells or PB mononuclear cells (PBMC), ND CD133+ cells, or a vehicle control were injected via a left intraventricular route into NOD/SCID mice with a femoral artery ligation immediately after injury. Doppler flow measurements were obtained weekly for 6 weeks comparing the perfusion ratio of ischemic/healthy limbs. At 28 days, perfusion ratios were statistically higher in study groups receiving ND CD133+ cells (0.51 \u00b1 0.06) compared to controls (0.37 \u00b1 0.03, p=0.025). Mice receiving patient CD133+ cells (0.46 \u00b1 0.04) or PBMC (0.37 \u00b1 0.08) did not show statistically significant improvement over control animals (p= 0.07, p= 0.94, respectively). BM was harvested to assess human engraftment by cytometric analysis. Mice injected with 0.5 x 10 6 patient BM CD133+ cells showed 70% purity and >70% viability) to chronic ischemic patients via an intracoronary route, important correlative in vitro and in vivo assays has demonstrated the diminished potency of BM-derived CD133+ cells as compared to CB and ND PB and BM-derived cells.",
