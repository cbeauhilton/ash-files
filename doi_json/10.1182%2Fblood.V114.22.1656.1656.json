    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1656 Poster Board I-682 To study the roles of IL-12 and Interferon-gamma (IFNg) in tumor immunity, we used RMAS lymphoma cells to challenge IL-12 receptor beta 2-deficient ( IL-12Rb2-/-) and IFNg receptor 1-deficient ( IFNgR1-/-) mice that are in the syngeneic C57BL/6J background. We intravenously injected mice with a dose of 1 \u00d7 10 4 RMAS cells that caused death in about 50% of wild-type (WT) mice. As shown in the Figure below, all of the WT mice treated with exogenous IL-12 were rescued from death caused by tumor growth; endogenous IL-12 was not sufficient to impact tumor growth since IL-12Rb2-/ - mice showed a survival rate similar to that of WT mice. However, all of the IFNgR1-/ - mice succumbed to tumor growth, indicating that endogenous IFNg is required for tumor immunity in this system. Furthermore, IL-12 treatment did not improve the survival of the IFNgR1-/ - mice, suggesting that IFNg signaling is required for IL-12's anti-tumor effect.

We have subsequently examined their effects on Treg cells in vivo . Compared to naive mice, significant Treg expansion (4.9 \u00b1 2.1 fold, n=5, p=0.025) was observed in the peritoneal cavity of WT mice within 2 weeks after an intraperitoneal injection of 1 \u00d7 10 4 RMAS cells. This expansion was completely blocked by treatment with exogenous IL-12. Treg cells in the IL-12Rb2-/ - mice expanded to levels comparable to that in WT animals, suggesting that endogenous IL-12 was not sufficient to control Treg expansion. In contrast, significantly higher Treg expansion was observed in IFNgR1-/ - mice (36.8 \u00b1 11.8 fold, n=5, p=0.002), which was partially inhibited by IL-12 treatment (13.2 \u00b1 3.5 fold, n=5, p=0.002), suggesting that an IFNg-independent mechanism may also account for IL-12's anti-Treg effect. To further study the effects of IL-12 and IFNg on cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) function, we performed mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) and used flow-based killing assays (FloKA) to measure cell contact-dependent killing of allogeneic P815 tumor cells. MLR-activated CTLs were found to kill tumor targets via perforin/granzyme-mediated cytotoxicity. At a 10:1 (effector:target) ratio, granzyme AxB-deficient CTLs and perforin-deficient CTLs displayed significantly reduced killing (8.6 \u00b1 1.2% and 4.5 \u00b1 0.9%, respectively) compared to WT CTLs (36.1 \u00b1 3.5%). IL-12 supplement (2ng/ml) to the MLR significantly increased the killing activity of WT CTLs (65.3 \u00b1 4.2%), but had no significant effect on granzyme AxB-deficient CTLs or perforin-deficient CTLs. In contrast, IFNg supplement (10ng/ml) to the MLR had no significant effect on the killing activity of CTLs. Conversely, MLR-activated IFNgR1-/ - CTLs killed P815 cells as efficiently as WT CTLs and responded to IL-12 treatment as efficiently as WT CTLs. Taken together, these data suggest that IL-12 treatment inhibits tumor-induced Treg expansion and stimulates IFNg-dependent anti-tumor immune responses. In addition, IL-12 also activates perforin/granzyme-dependent function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These differential effects on diverse immune components may collectively result in enhanced tumor immunity. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
