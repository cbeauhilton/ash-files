    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1878 NF-\u03baB activation is essential for leukemic cell and stem cell (LSC) survival and self-renewal, but is significantly less essential for similar functions in normal bone marrow hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). As a result, LSCs are more sensitive to both pharmacologic and genetic NF-\u03baB inhibition than HSPCs. These sensitivities suggest that NF-\u03baB signaling could be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of leukemia. However, high doses of NF-\u03baB inhibitor treatment are also associated with significant inflammation-mediated toxicity to liver, skin and other tissues. Therefore, new approaches are needed that will be able to protect normal tissues while simultaneously enhancing the effects of NF-\u03baB inhibition on leukemic cells. By utilizing genetic knock-out HSPC/leukemia models in combination with small molecule inhibitors, we searched for factors that could sensitize leukemic cells to NF-\u03baB inhibition while simultaneously protecting HSPCs. We demonstrated that targeted inhibition of TNF\u03b1 induced NF-\u03baB-independent signaling would be a useful approach to treat leukemia in combination with NF-\u03baB inhibition. We found that deactivating TNF\u03b1 signaling either by genetic deletion of its receptors or through neutralizing the ligand with an antibody can significantly enhance NF-\u03baB inhibition-induced leukemic cell elimination. In contrast, deactivation of TNF\u03b1 signaling can significantly protect normal HSPCs from NF-\u03baB inhibitor-induced death. Mechanistic studies revealed that TNF\u03b1 stimulates several similar signals in both leukemic cells and HSPCs, including NF-\u03baB, ERK, AKT, p38 and JNK. In order to determine which of these signals would best augment NF-\u03baB inhibition, we performed biochemical analyses and searched for candidate survival signals activated downstream of TNF\u03b1 and that operated independently of NF-\u03baB. This analysis revealed that TNF\u03b1-induced ERK and AKT signals are NF-\u03baB dependent, while TNF\u03b1-induced p38 and JNK signals are NF-\u03baB independent. Inhibition of p38 enhanced leukemic cell growth, and was therefore ruled out as a candidate. Our analyses showed that JNK was activated by TNF\u03b1 stimulation, operated independently of NF-\u03baB activation, and also repressed leukemic cell growth. Further study confirmed that TNF\u03b1-dependent JNK activation has opposite functions in HSPCs and leukemic cells: JNK acts by promoting cell survival in leukemic cells while inducing cell death in HSPCs. We confirmed this result by inactivating the JNK signal via small molecule inhibitor, and found that we could significantly sensitize leukemic cells to NF-\u03baB inhibition while protecting normal HSPCs from TNF\u03b1-mediated cell death associated with NF-\u03baB inhibition. Mechanism analysis suggested that TNF\u03b1 represses the growth of HSPCs by a JNK-RIP1/RIP3-dependent necroptosis mechanism, whereas TNF\u03b1 promotes the expansion of leukemic cells by inducing the parallel activation of NF-\u03baB-dependent AKT/ERK signaling and NF-\u03baB-independent JNK signaling. In conclusion, our studies suggest the simultaneous inhibition of both NF-\u03baB and TNF\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB-independent signals like JNK might provide a more comprehensive approach for targeted treatment of leukemias that also protects against deleterious inflammation in the bone marrow and other tissues.
