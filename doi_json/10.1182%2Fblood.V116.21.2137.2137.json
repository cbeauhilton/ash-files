    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2137 The chemokine CXCL12, and its receptor CXCR4, play an essential role in homing and engraftment of normal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow, with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 inducing the rapid mobilization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells into the blood in mice and humans. We have previously demonstrated that AMD3100 similarly induces the mobilization of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells into the peripheral blood. The bone marrow microenvironment is thought to provide a protective niche for ALL cells, contributing to chemo-resistance. As a result, compounds that disrupt leukemic cell interactions with the bone marrow microenvironment are of interest as chemo-sensitizing agents. However, the mobilization of normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells may also increase bone marrow toxicity. To better evaluate how such mobilizing agents affect normal hematopoietic progenitors and ALL cells, the temporal response of ALL cells to the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 was compared to that of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells using a NOD/SCID xenograft model of ALL and BALB/c mice respectively. ALL cells from all 7 pre-B ALL xenografts were mobilized into the peripheral blood by AMD3100. Mobilization was apparent 1 hour and maximal 3 hours after drug administration, similar to that observed for normal hematopoietic progenitors. However, ALL cells remained in the circulation for longer than normal hematopoietic progenitors. The number of ALL cells in the circulation remained significantly elevated in 6 of 7 xenografts examined, 6 hours post AMD3100 administration, a time point by which circulating normal hematopoietic progenitor levels had returned to baseline. No correlation between the expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 or the adhesion molecules VLA-4, VLA-5 or CD44, and the extent or duration of ALL cell mobilization was detected. In contrast, the overall motility of the ALL cells in chemotaxis assays was predictive of the extent of ALL cell mobilization. This was not due to CXCL12-specific chemotaxis because the association was lost when correction for background motility was undertaken. In addition, AMD3100 increased the proportion of actively cells ALL cells in the peripheral blood. This did not appear to be due to selective mobilization of cycling cells but reflected the more proliferative nature of bone marrow as compared to peripheral blood ALL cells. This is in contrast to the selective mobilization of quiescent normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells by AMD3100. Consistent with these findings, the addition of AMD3100 to the cell cycle dependent drug vincristine, increased the efficacy of this agent in NOD/SCID mice engrafted with ALL. Overall, this suggests that ALL cells will be more sensitive to effects of agents that disrupt interactions with the bone marrow microenvironment than normal progenitors, and that combining agents that disrupt ALL retention in the bone marrow may increase the therapeutic effect of cell cycle dependent chemotherapeutic agents.
