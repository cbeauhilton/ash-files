    "abstract_text": "Autologous stem cell transplant is an effective modality for many patients with lymphoproliferative disorders. Still, the majority of patients with myeloma and many with lymphoma relapse after transplant. Innovative post-transplant immunotherapies are needed. We initiated a phase I immune mobilization trial utilizing dose escalation of IL-2, in combination with GM-CSF and G-CSF, in an attempt to mobilize autologous cytotoxic effector cells, along with peripheral CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. IL-2 began on day 0 of mobilization and continued as a daily SQ injection for 11 days. On day 7 of mobilization, GM-CSF (7.5 mcg/kg/d) and G-CSF (5 mcg/kg/d) were initiated for 5 days (day 7\u201311). On day 11, leukapheresis was performed. Patients then received melphalan (200 mg/m2) followed by reinfusion of cryopreserved autologous peripheral hematopoietic progenitor cells. Phenotypic and functional analyses were performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) collected during mobilization on days 0, 7 and 11. Eleven of 12 patients treated to date completed the regimen (myeloma, n=11; NHL, n=1). One patient (NHL) was removed due to progressive disease. The first two dose levels of IL-2 have been well tolerated (dose level 1: 6x10 5 IU/m2/d; n=6 pts; dose level 2: 1x10 6 IU/m2/d; n=6 pts) with no \u2265grade 3 toxicities noted. Dose escalation of IL-2 continues since the MTD has not been reached. Phenotypic analyses of PBMNC demonstrate an increase in CD3+CD8+ T cells from 17.5% (day 0 baseline) to 22.7% (day 11; p = 0.01). CD56+ NK cells increased from 18.9% (day 0) to 36.0% (day 11; p = 0.002), and CD8+CD56+ NKT cells increased from 8.2% (day 0) to 18.0% (day 11; p = 0.01). Cytotoxicity directed against a human myeloma cell line using peripheral blood lymphocytes was 8.6% at baseline and increased to 43% on day 11 of mobilization (p=0.03). All patients successfully mobilized and received an autologous transplant without delay in engraftment (ANC recovery: day 13 median; range 10\u201314 days; platelet recovery: day 12 median; range of 0\u201313 days). These results are encouraging and demonstrate effective mobilization with minimal toxicity and marked in vivo immunomodulatory effects. In addition, the enhanced cytotoxic effector cell number and killing of myeloma cells is quite promising, with additional follow up ongoing to determine the potential impact on survival."
