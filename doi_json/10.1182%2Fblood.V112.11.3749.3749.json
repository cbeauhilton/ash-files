    "abstract_text": "Background: Hypogammaglobulinemia of the \u201cuninvolved\u201d immunoglobulins is commonly observed in Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinemia (WM), and has often been attributed to disease-related suppression. However, there is a paucity of information related to the pathogenesis of hypogammaglobulinemia in these disorders. Methods: We evaluated the incidence of IgA and IgG hypogammaglobulinemia in 207 patients with WM, and addressed the impact of therapy and response on IgA and IgG levels for 93 of these patients who required subsequent treatment. We also performed extensive sequence analysis of the promoter, all exonic, and flanking intronic regions from peripheral blood of 19 untreated WM patients who demonstrated IgA and/or IgG hypogammaglobulinemia for 8 genes often observed in common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVID) and B cell deficiency i.e. AICDA, BTK, CD40, CD154, NEMO(IkBkG), TACI, SH2D1A, UNG. Results: At baseline, 120/207 (58.0%), 131/207 (63.3%), and 102/196 (49.3%) patients had abnormally low levels of serum IgG (C (n=2) and a hemizygous missense mutation at codon 113 for NEMO (n=1), and a heterozygous missense mutation at codon 142 in UNG (n=1). Conclusions: The results of these studies demonstrate that IgA and IgG hypogammaglobulinemia is a constitutive feature of patients with WM, which neither correlates with, nor is impacted by disease burden, despite therapeutic intervention and response. The results also suggest that patients with WM may harbor sequence mutations, which may be a contributor to the pathogenesis and/or morbidity of WM.",
