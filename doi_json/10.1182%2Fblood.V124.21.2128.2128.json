    "abstract_text": "Despite the increasing availability of novel agents for RRMM, many patients run out of treatment options due to disease refractoriness and/or progressive toxicities, both hematological (cytopenia) and non-hematological (cachexia, asthenia, renal and cardiopulmonary).Patients who are refractory to both proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents (IMIDs) carry an ominous prognosis with a median overall survival (OS) of 9 months (Leukemia, Kumar 2013). We previously reported on the efficacy and toxicity profiles of a metronomically scheduled chemotherapy regimen administered over the course of 16 days (Haematologica, Papanikolaou 2014). Encouraged by the results of that treatment, we have since modified metronomic chemotherapy to cover a 28-day period (metro28). The regimen consisted largely of bortezomib 1.0mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13,16,19, 22,25,28; along with dexamethasone 12mg on days 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22, 25-28; thalidomide 100mg days 1-28, continuous 28 day infusion of doxorubicin 1.0mg/m2 (0.5mg/m2 for Ejection Fraction 2mg/dL), with the addition of arsenic trioxide (ATO) at 0.1mg/kg on each day after bortezomib; and lately vincristine (VCR) at 0.07mg daily dose by continuous infusion for 28 days. Patient characteristics included age >65yr, 46%; female, 33%; cytogenetic abnormalities at any time prior to therapy (CA), 86%; Gene Expression Profile (GEP) 70-defined high risk, 44%. The median number of prior therapies was 8 (1-64), prior transplants, 83% (1, 2, >=3), 20%, 32%, 31%; prior exposure to novel agents including Carfilzomib/Pomalidomide was 81%. Thrombocytopenia prior to treatment was present in 75% including thrombocytopenia <50,000/uL in 15%. Clinical outcomes are depicted in Figure 1 . At a median follow up of 8.1 months, the median number of metro 28 cycles administered was 1 (1-5), with 37% achieving a partial response and median OS not yet reached. Interestingly, the 6 month - partial response duration estimate for the patients achieving PR was 53% ( Figure 1 A), while the one year OS estimate for all patients receiving metro 28 was 59% ( Figure 1 B). Prognostic factors that held statistical significance in univariate analysis for overall survival were albumin <3.5 g/dl (HR 2.56, P=0.009), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) \u22653.5 mg/L (HR 3.03, P=0.003), LDH\u2265 190 U/L (HR 2.81, P=0.003), GEP-70 High Risk (HR 2.32, P=0.048), GEP-5 High Risk (HR 5.75, P<0.001) ( Figure 1 C) and GEP PR subgroup designation (HR 3.71, P=0.003). In multivariate analysis, albumin < 3.5 g/dL (HR 2.81, P=0.035), B2M\u2265 3.5 mg/L (HR 3.4, P=0.017), GEP PR subgroup (HR 3.8, P=0.012), and GEP-5 High Risk (HR 8.58, P<0.001) ( Figure 1 C) achieved statistical significance. The majority of cycles administered in the patient population were done in the outpatient setting (81%), while secondary admissions due to regimen toxicity occurred in 36% of the cycles administered. Grade 3 & 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia within 3 months from the start of the metronomic treatment were evident in 64% and 78% respectively of the cases. Treatment related mortality was 2%, due to one instance each of grade 5 infection and cerebrovascular event. In conclusion 28 day metronomic therapy is a feasible treatment with acceptable toxicity and encouraging preliminary results both in terms of ORR and OS for RRMM.
