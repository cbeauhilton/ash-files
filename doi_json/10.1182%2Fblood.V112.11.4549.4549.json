    "abstract_text": "Objective To develop an animal test method for evaluating the in vivo quality of human platelet concentrates. Methods Human platelets were transfused to mice by tail vein with a 1mL insulin syring fitted with a 29-gauge ultra-fine needle. Blood samples were taken at 30 minutes,2,4,6,8,12, and 24hours after infusion with a tail vein nick technique, whole blood was collected into heparinized capillary tubes. Human platelets in mouse whole blood were detected by flow cytometry with monoclonal anti-human CD61-PE\u2013conjugated antibodies. All subsequent recoveries were calculated as a percentage of the initial collection. Results The survival time of human platelets were significantly prolonged in SCID than in BALB/c,FVB mice. Recoveries at 4 hours after transfusion in SCID, BALB/c,FVB mice were 68.6%\u00b18.1%( n =10),29.9%\u00b16.5%( n =8),28.1%\u00b15.5%( n =8), respectively, and with a T \u00bd estimate of 8 hours for SCID, 2.5 hours for BALB/c and 2 hours for FVB mice. platelet storage lesions either by chemical treatment or by suboptimal conditions storage exhibited decreased recoveries in SCID mice. Conclusion The quality of platelet Products can be evaluated by assessing the survival of human platelets in SCID mice using flow cytometry.",
