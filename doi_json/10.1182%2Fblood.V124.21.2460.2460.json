    "abstract_text": "Aim To identify the causes and consequences of omission and/or reduction of methotrexate (MTX) doses in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis used during allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). Method We conducted a retrospective medical record review of 125 alloHCTs performed between the years 2011 and 2013 at our hospital where MTX (15, 10, 10, 10 mg/m 2 intravenously on day [D] +1, D+3, D+6, D+11 respectively) is used with cyclosporine as GVHD prophylaxis. The association of MTX dose omission with overall survival (OS), non-relapse mortality (NRM) and acute GVHD, measured from a landmark of D+12, was evaluated with univariate and multivariate analysis. Results 116 patients (median age 48, range 17-67, 59% male) were eligible for analysis. Commonest indications for alloHCT were acute leukemia (47%) and chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (28%). Conditioning was myeloablative in 54%, donors were siblings in 53%, and grafts were peripheral blood in 87%. 85 patients (73%) received all four full doses of MTX. 22 patients had a dose omission at D+11, and two at both D+6 and D+11. 43 patients were given folinic acid rescue. Documented reasons for MTX alteration were mucositis (n = 22; World Health Organisation mucositis grade 4 in 16 patients, grade 3 in 4 patients and grade 2 in 2 patients), fluid overload (n = 10), liver impairment (n = 8, median bilirubin 83 micromol/L, range 19-204 micromol/L, normal < 21 micromol/L), renal impairment (n = 8, median creatinine 138 micromol/L, range 67-276 micromol/L, normal 45-90 micromol/L) and sepsis (1). MTX omission was associated with poorer OS (48% vs 90%; hazard ratio [HR] for mortality 5.4, 95% CI 2.5-11.7, P < 0.001, Figure 1 ) and higher NRM (39% vs 5%, HR 10.2, 95% CI 3.4-30.8, P < 0.001, Figure 2 ) at 12 months post landmark. A pattern of ongoing NRM was observed beyond day 100. Strikingly, those patients who received all four full doses of MTX had NRM of 0% at 100 days post landmark. There was no difference in rates of grade 2-4 (24% vs 22%, P = .950) or grade 3-4 (9% vs 11%, P = .662) acute GVHD, or relapse (20% vs 17%, P = .514), at day 100 post landmark. Conclusion MTX dose reduction has no significant impact on GVHD development, suggesting that MTX omissions or other adjustments of GVHD prophylaxis did not lead to enhanced T cell activation. However, it seems that the need to reduce MTX indicates an increased risk of NRM, likely reflecting ongoing organ dysfunction. Older patients or those with pre-transplant co-morbidities may be better served by strategies that lower the likelihood of organ toxicity, including reduced intensity conditioning and lower initial doses of MTX.
