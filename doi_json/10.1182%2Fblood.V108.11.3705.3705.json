    "abstract_text": "Immunotherapy utilizing genetically-modified cytolytic T-lymphocytes (CTL) provides a promising therapeutic approach for treating a variety of diseases, including cancer. We have demonstrated that CTLs encoding a chimeric T-cell receptor (IL13-zetakine), consisting of an extracellular IL-13 domain and a cytoplasmic CD3 domain, can be re-directed to target malignant glioma both in vitro and in animal models. This chimera re-targets the antigen-specific effector functions of modified CTLs to recognize glioblastomas due to the high expression of IL13R in these tumors. However, practical application of this approach is limited by the fact that patients undergoing surgical resection of the tumor often require treatment with glucocorticoids to control the resulting inflammation. Such treatment blocks the activity of the re-directed CTL clones and thus inhibits their therapeutic action. To overcome this limitation and render these tumor-specific CTLs resistant to glucocorticoids we have chosen to employ engineered ZFNs to specifically disrupt the endogenous glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene. Heterodimeric ZFNs, consisting of the cleavage domain of the restriction enzyme FokI linked to engineered zinc finger DNA-binding domains, can be designed to specifically cleave a predetermined site in the genome. We have shown that these ZFN-induced double strand breaks can promote homologous recombination with high efficiency. In the present study we have investigated the use of ZFNs to simultaneously effect functional inactivation of human GR via specifically targeting the integration of the IL13-zetakine expression cassette into the GR locus itself. We can show that GR-specific ZFNs cleave their intended target sequences with high specificity and efficiency - resulting in the disruption of GR and the creation of glucocorticoid resistant cells. Moreover, we can demonstrate that these ZFNs coupled with an appropriate IL13-zetakine containing donor-DNA molecule can stimulate the integration of this chimeric T-cell receptor directly into the GR locus. Thus, this procedure results in the simultaneous knockout of GR and addition of the IL13-zetakine in a genetically defined manner. These data support the notion that ZFN-modified cells can be engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors from a predetermined genomic locus and may provide a general approach to generating effective cellular immunotherapy strategies.",
