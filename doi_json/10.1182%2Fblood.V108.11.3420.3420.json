    "abstract_text": "Wnt signaling is a highly conserved signal transduction pathway involved in embryonic development. Inappropriate canonical Wnt signaling resulting in beta-catenin stabilization, is associated with several types of human cancers. Multiple myeloma plasma cells express Wnt receptors, Wnt ligands and soluble Wnt inhibitors. Wnt signaling is central to osteoblast and osteoclasts development and secretion of Wnt signaling inhibitors by myeloma cells is thought to contribute to the osteolytic phenotype seen in this disease and prostate cancer. While it is now clear that MM cells can signal through both canonical and non-canonical mechanisms, there are conflicting data as to the direct role of Wnt signaling in myeloma cell biology. Others have shown that Wnts cause proliferation of myeloma cells; while we have shown that canonical Wnts cause morphological changes and migration, but not cell proliferation. To further elucidate the role of canonical Wnt signaling in myeloma and myeloma bone disease we used limiting dilutions in the presence of G418 to create two independent stable clones of the myeloma cell line NCI-H929 expressing Wnt-3A (H929/W3A), which is not expressed in myeloma, and an empty vector (H929/EV). Because Wnt antibodies are not available we cloned Wnt-3A as a fusion protein with hemagglutinin (HA). Western blots against HA revealed a positive band of the expected size only in the H929/W3A clones. GST-E-cadherin binding assay and Western blot analysis revealed elevated levels of total and free beta-catenin in H929/W3A relative to H929/EV, however, there this was not associated with increased growth or proliferation by MTT assay. To determine the in-vivo growth characteristics and effects on bone resorption of Wnt-3A producing cells, we transplanted the lines into a human bone implanted the flank of SCID mice. Tumor growth rate as determined by increased production of human immunoglobulin in mice serum was significantly slower in the Wnt-3A transfected cells relative to controls (P < .05). Loss of bone mineral density (BMD) of the implanted bones engrafted with H929/W3A cells was lower than in bones engrafted with H929/EV cells (P < .05). Reduced tumor burden and BMD loss was also visualized on x-ray radiographs. Taken together these data indicate that all factors promoting bone resorption produced by or elicited by the myeloma cell line H929 are subordinate to canonical Wnt signaling and that prevention of bone destruction may help control myeloma progression.",
