    "abstract_text": "Introduction Endothelial function is impaired in adults with sickle cell anaemia (SCA), but limited data exists in children. Endothelial damage occurs from chronic inflammation, oxidant damage, immune cell activation and ischemia-reperfusion injury. In addition, availability of nitric oxide (NO) as the major vasodilator may be reduced as a result of scavenging by plasma haemoglobin and reduced arginine substrate for endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Methods Tanzanian children (N=119) with SCA (HbSS) aged 8-11.9 years enrolled in the Vascular Function Intervention Trial (ISRCTN74331412/NCT01718054) underwent baseline assessment of endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilatation. All children were determined clinically well at assessment, hydroxyurea naive, on no long-term medication and not receiving chronic blood transfusions. Blood pressure and vasomotion were assessed after 10 minutes recumbent rest in a temperature controlled room between 08-13:00 hrs. An identical protocol as published in children (Donald & Charakida et al. Eur Heart J; 2010: 31; 1502-10) was used. In brief, brachial arterial endothelium dependent dilatation was assessed by 1 of 3 trained technicians using ultrasound imaging (Ultrasonix SonixTouch with a 12Mz probe & stereotactic holder) to assess flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in response to reactive hyperaemia induced after release of transient blood pressure cuff occlusion (5 min, 200 mmHg, Hokanson, USA) using an automated air regulator (Logan Research, UK). Automated B-mode image edge detection was used to measure maximum change in arterial diameter (Brachial Tools) expressed as a percentage of resting baseline diameter (FMD max ). Endothelium-independent responses to 2.5\u00b5g sub-lingual glyceryl-trinitrate (GTN) were also assessed. All recordings were over-read by an experienced researcher in the UK. Venepuncture for full blood count, clinical chemistry and amino acids was conducted after FMD assessment. Results Patient characteristics are described in Table 1 . Mean brachial artery diameter at baseline was 2.61mm (95% CI 2.55 \u2013 2.67mm). Mean FMD max was 7.70% (95% CI 7.09 \u2013 8.32%). Endothelium-independent vasodilation (GTN max ) was 4.15% (95% CI 3.83 \u2013 4.47%). The FMD max response was on greater than the GTN max response ( Figure 1 ). No effect of room or skin temperature on FMD max or GTN max was observed. There was a strong inverse association between baseline artery diameter and FMD max (-3.46, P<0.001) ( Figure 2 ). The time to peak brachial artery diameter in response to hyperaemia was positively skewed (median 55s (IQR: 43-79s)) and was not associated with FMD max . The only patient characteristic associated with FMD max was age with a non-significant inverse correlation (-0.52, P=0.06) but was reduced when adjusting for baseline diameter. Baseline heart rate was positively associated with FMD max and GTN max (P=0.01 & 0.025). Table 1 Patient characteristics Subjects N=119 . Mean (SD) unless otherwise stated .

Mean FMD max was slightly lower than that observed in predominantly Caucasian non-SCA British children of similar age (8.1% [SD3.4]) (Donald & Charakida et al. Eur Heart J 2010: 31; 1502-10), but higher than reported in 21 older French children with SCA (5.6 +/- 0.2) (Montalembert et al. Haematol 2007: 92; 1709-10) which might reflect deterioration of endothelial function with age. There was no apparent association between FMD max and hemolytic markers or with nutritional status at baseline. Recruitment and assessment of appropriate local non-SCA controls for comparison is planned. Amino acid analyses are ongoing. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
