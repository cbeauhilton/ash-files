    "abstract_text": "The IL23R gene on chromosome 1p31 encodes a subunit of the receptor for the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-23. Recently, IL23R could be identified as a novel inflammatory bowel disease susceptibility gene. The exchange of arginine with glutamine at position 381 of IL23R causes a blockade of the IL-23 signaling pathway which is associated with a reduced risk of both Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. IL-23 is a pivotal cytokine in the differentiation of T cells into inflammatory, IL-17-producing T cells. Because of the requirement for IL-23 in autoimmune disease we hypothesized that IL23R Arg381Gln reduces the risk of graft-versus host disease (GVHD) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). 141 donors and 141 children (median age, 12 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=63), acute myeloid leukemia (n=40), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=26) or chronic myeloid leukemia (n=12) who underwent allogeneic bone marrow (n=93) or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (n=48; T-cell depleted: n=22) in a single center were genotyped of IL23R for rs11209026 (c.1142G>A, p.Arg381Gln) using TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction. The donor was HLA-matched unrelated in 60% of transplants and HLA-identical related in 30% of transplants. Conditioning regimen was myeloablative in all cases. Two forms of post-transplant immunosuppression predominated, cyclosporine A and methotrexate in 65% of transplants and cyclosporine A alone in 24% of transplants. The IL23R Arg381Gln variant was present in 16 of the 141 donors (11.3%) and in 15 of the 141 patients (10.6%). Interestingly, we found a significantly reduced incidence of acute GVHD grade II\u2013IV in patients who were transplanted from a donor with this specific variant (6.2% versus 33.6%; p=0.025). Furthermore, there was no severe acute GVHD grade III\u2013IV if the variant occurred in the donor (0% versus 14.4%). In three of the donor-patient pairs the variant was present in both individuals and no acute GVHD was observed. The occurrence of the IL23R variant, in either donors or recipients, had no significant impact on chronic GVHD, relapse rate, treatment related mortality, and overall survival. In conclusion, IL23R Arg381Gln variant in the donor confers strong protection against acute GVHD after HSCT in children with hematological malignancies. Therefore, the IL23 signaling pathway seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute GVHD. Blockade of the IL23 receptor by a monoclonal antibody could be a rational therapeutic strategy for acute GVHD."
