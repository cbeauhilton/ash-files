The utility of prognostic testing in CLL patients may vary based on age at diagnosis given the higher mortality from other causes among older individuals. The goals of the present study were to i) evaluate differences in natural history of CLL patients based on age at diagnosis, ii) compare survival to age-matched individuals in the general population, and iii) determine the age-stratified utility of prognostic testing. METHODS: All 2487 CLL/SLL patients diagnosed between January 1995 and June 2008 and cared for in the Mayo Clinic Division of Hematology were categorized by age at diagnosis (<55 years, 55-64 years, 65-74 years, or \u226575 years) and evaluated for differences in clinical characteristics, TFT, and OS using chi-square tests. IGHV gene mutation analysis, ZAP-70 status, CD38 status, and cytogenetics abnormalities by interphase FISH testing were performed as part of clinical and/or research studies using methods previously described by our group. Cox regression was used to evaluate the ability of prognostic parameters to predict clinical outcome stratified by age at diagnosis. Patient survival was compared to that of the age matched Minnesota population. RESULTS: When grouped by age, 593 patients were age <55, 713 age 55-64, 748 age 65-74, and 433 age \u226575 at diagnosis. As of last follow-up, 268, 282, 296, and 108 patients in these age groups have been treated, respectively and 112, 171, 254, and 199 patients have died. Survival decreased as the age at diagnosis increased (p<0.001). OS of CLL patients was significantly shorter than that of the age-matched general population for patients age <55 years (p<0.001), 55-64 years (p<0.001), and 65-74 years (p<0.001) at diagnosis but not those \u226575 years (p=0.136). Among Rai stage 0 patients, survival was also shorter than that of the age-matched general population for CLL patients age <55 years (p<0.001), 55-64 years (p<0.001), and 65-74 years (p<0.001) but not those \u2265 age 75 at diagnosis (p=0.07). No statistically significant differences were observed in CD38 status, IGHV mutation status, ZAP-70 status or the frequency of common cytogenetic abnormalities on FISH based on age at diagnosis category. Consistent with prior reports, all of these parameters were powerful predictors of TFT and OS for the overall cohort on univariate analysis (all p<0.001 for both TFT and OS). Given the variation in TFT and OS based on age at diagnosis, we next evaluated the utility of these prognostic parameters for predicting TFT and OS in each age category after adjusting for stage. CD38, IGHV mutation, and ZAP-70 each predicted TFT independent of stage for all age groups (all p <0.05). FISH results predicted TFT independent of stage for patients age 55-64 and 65-74 however did not reach statistical significance for those age <55 (p=0.18) or \u226575 (p=0.07). The utility of these parameters for predicting OS independent of stage was less consistent and varied by age. IGHV predicted OS independent of stage for patients <age 55 (p<0.001), 55-64 (p=0.007), and 65-74 (p'0.001) but was not a significant predictor of OS among those \u226575 (p=0.15). CD38, ZAP-70, and FISH each predicted survival independent of stage for only 2 of the 4 age categories (ZAP-70 for age <55 and 55-64; FISH for age <55 and 65-74; CD38 for 55-64 and \u226575). CONCLUSIONS: Survival of CLL patients is shorter than that of the age-matched general population for individuals age <75 at diagnosis regardless of disease stage. In contrast, survival does not differ from the age-matched general population among CLL patients \u2265age 75 at diagnosis. Prognostic testing using CD38, IGHV mutation, and ZAP-70 is useful for predicting TFT independent of stage for CLL patients of all ages (including those \u2265age 75) but has less value for predicting OS particularly as the age at diagnosis increases. IGHV appeared to be the best predictor of OS independent of stage among all patients age <75. Unexpectedly, prognostic testing had little utility for predicting OS independent of stage among patients age \u226575. These findings have important implications regarding the use of prognostic tests in patients with CLL as well as the use of test results to select patients for clinical trials testing early treatment for asymptomatic individuals.
