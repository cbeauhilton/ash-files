    "abstract_text": "Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily, and mediate their effects mainly through the Smad signalling pathway. Whereas TGF-\u03b2 is well established as one of the most potent negative regulators in hematopoietic cells, the role of BMPs remains more elusive. We have previously shown that BMP-6 inhibits the growth of nai\u0308ve and memory human B cells. As high BMP-6 mRNA expression is associated with poor outcome in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL; Rosenwald et al, N Engl J Med 2002), we hypothesized that resistance towards BMP-induced growth inhibition is a possible mechanism for lymphomagenesis. In the current study, 7 B cell lymphoma cell lines (representing Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and DLBCL) and tumour material from lymphoma patients were investigated to unravel the role of BMPs in lymphomas. We analyzed the expression of BMP receptors by FACS analysis, and found variable expression of the BMP receptor type I (Alk2, Alk3 and Alk6) and type II (BMP RII, Activin RIIA and RIIB) among the cell lines and in primary lymphoma cells, suggesting variable binding of BMPs. We next investigated the effect of BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6 and BMP-7 on proliferation and survival of B lymphoma cell lines, and found 2 of 7 cell lines to be resistant towards BMP-2 and BMP-4 induced growth inhibition. In contrast, 4 of 7 and 7 of 7 cell lines were resistant to BMP-6 and BMP-7 induced growth inhibition, respectively. In Sudhl6 cells that were highly sensitive to BMP-2 and BMP-6 induced apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation, we demonstrated that the cytokines IL-10, CD40 Ligand and BLyS were able to counteract the negative effects induced by BMPs, while IL-2 and IL-4 were not. On the contrary, both BMP-2 and BMP-6 greatly increased anti-IgM activation induced apoptosis. In resistant lymphoma cells, the BMPs were not able to induce detectable levels or induced low levels of phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8 compared to sensitive cell lines. Low or no increase in phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 induced by BMPs could only partly be explained by low/ undetectable expression of BMP receptors. Hence, upregulation of inhibitory Smads (Smad6, Smad7) or mutations in receptors or Smads represent other possible mechanisms for resistance to BMPs in lymphomas, and this is currently under investigation. We also investigated if the lymphoma cells produced BMPs themselves and found that 5 of 7 cell lines and 3 of 5 primary lymphomas produced significant amounts of BMP-7. Some lymphoma cells also had detectable levels of BMP-4 and BMP-6. Our findings that lymphoma cells are resistant towards BMP-7 and to some degree BMP-6 induced growth inhibition, whereas they produce these cytokines, suggest that resistance towards BMP induced signalling in B cell lymphomas can contribute to increased tumour growth.",
