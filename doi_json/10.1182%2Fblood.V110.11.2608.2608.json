    "abstract_text": "Transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes, associated with DNA methylation, is a common epigenetic event in leukemias and myelodisplastic syndromes. Much less is known about the specific methylation changes that occur in DCLC, FL and their normal counterpart BFH. Methylation of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors is more common in high grade lymphomas and may be an important step in the progression and transformation of follicular lymphoma. We determined the methylation status of 7 tumor suppressor genes in 31 patients with B-cell malignancies. Seven patients with benign follicular hyperplasia were used as normal controls. The target genes chosen are potentially involved in B-cells malignancies and encoding proteins implicated in apoptosis regulation (death associated protein kinase, DAP-K), Jak/STAT3 signalling pathway (SHP1), hormonal response (RARb), DNA repair (O6-methilguanine-DNA methyltranferase, MGMT), cell cycle control (p14ARF and p15INK4b) and detoxification of environmental xenobiotics such as doxorubicin (glutathione S-transferase P1, GSTP1). Genomic DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded samples of thirty one B-cell malignancies (twenty six DLCL and five FL) were analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction to determine promoter hypermethylation of DAP-k, SHP1, Rar\u03b2, MGMT, p14, p15 and GSTP1. Samples were obtained mostly from lymph nodes; spleen, stomach, skin, and parathyroid gland biopsies were also included. Specimens were collected at diagnosis before specific therapy. Diagnosis was based on morphology and immunohistochemistry analysis. All cases were matched for age, sex and ethnic origin. DAP-k promoter methylation occurred with similar frequency in DLCL (100%), FL (100%) and BFH (86%). SHP1 was methylated in 75% of DLCL, all FL and the 7 patients with BFH. RARb was methylated in all DLCL and FL patients and 85% of the BFH. Sixteen (50%) DLCL, three (60%) FL and none BFH patients showed MGMT methylation. Promoter hypermethylation of p14 and p15 was detected in 11 (42%) and 13 (50%) DLCL, 2 (40%) and 3(60%) FL, 3(42%) and 5(71%) BFH patients respectively. Methylation of GSTP1 was absent in all samples. Inactivacion of DAP-K, SHP1 and Rar\u03b2 is present in B-cell malignancies, DLCL and FL, and BFH. Therefore, it may represent a physiologic event conferring a temporal survival advantage necessary for a BFH response. With our data methylation of Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors such as p14 and p15 is not a differential pathogenic event in DLCL with respect to FL or BFH. Finally, the absence of GSTP1 methylation in DLCL and FL questions its relevance in B-cell neoplasia development.",
