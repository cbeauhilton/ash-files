    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Transplantation of functional hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) using peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM) or cord blood (CB) cells is widely used to treat malignant and nonmalignant disorders. Because long-term cryopreservation is performed for PB, BM and CB cells, and these are often used years after cell harvests, the implementation of a quality-assurance is a major requirement to ensure graft safety for clinical use. Methods: We assessed the efficiency of recovery of viable HSC from 37 patients (pts; n=20 NHL, n=6 Hodgkin, n=9 MM, n=2 AML) and 6 allogeneic-donors (AD) with stored PBSC samples. All pts had received an auto-PBSCT between 1992\u20132004. Stored PBSC samples used in this analysis had been cryopreserved for a median of 5.6 years (y; range: 1.3\u201312). We determined post-thawing recovery, cell viability, ex vivo expansion potential, CD34+ numbers, CFU growth in methylcellulose culture and LTC-ICs. Viable cells were determined by trypan blue and propidium iodide via FACS analysis, CFUs in 0.9% methylcellulose (supplemented with IMDM, 30% FCS and EPO, IL-3+GM-CSF) and LTC-IC as previously described. Pts and AD were analyzed as a total group and within 3 subgroups of: A) \u2018long-term\u2019 cryopreservation: n=21 PBSC harvests had a median cryopreservation of 9.5y (8\u201312), B) \u2018short-term\u2019 cryopreservation: n=16 harvests had a 2.9y (1.3\u20135.6) cryopreservation period, and C) n=6 pts showing delayed engraftment (EG) or early death after auto-PBSCT: the cryopreservation in these 6 pts was 2.7y (2.2\u20133.5). Cryopreservation results were correlated with clinical results and EG. Results: Hematopoietic EG in group A and B was prompt with WBC>1000/\u03bcl and platelets>20,000/\u03bcl on d10\u201311 post PBSC reinfusion. EG in group C was delayed albeit 4.3x106 CD34+ cells/kg bw (2.1\u20138.6) had been retransfused (WBC>1000/\u03bcl + platelets>20,000/\u03bcl: d+13 post PBSC infusion, non-platelet-EG >20,000/\u03bcl before death: n=5). Primary cause of death in group C was progressive disease in 3 and serious infections in 5 pts. Group A showed 74.3% viable cells post-thawing in PBSC grafts. Median number of CD34+ cells were 2.9%. Median numbers of CFU-C, BFU-E and GEMM were 36, 60 and 7, respectively. This was comparable with results in group B, showing 70% viable cells post-thawing, CD34+ cells of 4.2% and CFUs of 43, 75 and 6, respectively (p>0.05). Proliferative capacity was intact in both groups after 7 days of suspension culture, generating CFU-C, BFU-E and GEMM of 67, 29 and 1, respectively. In group C, viable cells were present in only 58% and median CFU-C, BFU-E and GEMM were 21, 5 and 0, respectively (p<0.05). After 7 days of suspension culture, total CFUs were 5 (<5% as compared to group A+B). Mean CFU-Cs before and after LTC-IC were 9 and 8 after LTC-IC culture in group C, whereas these were 18 and 16 in group A (p<0.05). Thus, the percentage of viable cells, CFUs and LTC-ICs was preserved after long-term cryopreservation (group A), showed no significant difference between group A+B, but were decreased in group C. Conclusions: We show that human PBSC can be stored for more than a decade without apparent loss of HSC activity and can be efficiently retrieved. These results reinforce that expiration dates cannot be set for safely stored cryopreserved HSC. Assessment of CD34+ cell numbers, clonogenic potential via methylcellulose and LTC-IC assays are clinically relevant, since they may correlate with clinical outcome. Thus, these hematopoietic assays are valuable to assess the quality of cryopreservation and possibly also outcome of PBSCT.",
