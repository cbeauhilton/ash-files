    "abstract_text": "For most leukemia the target cells of transforming mutations are still unknown. Here, we studied the developmental origin of t(8;21)-acute myeloid leukemia (AML), t(15;17)-acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and t(9;22)-chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Purified mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and various committed myeloid progenitor cells were retrovirally transduced with AML1/ETO, PML/RAR\u03b1, or p210 BCR/ABL and subjected to in-vitro serial replating assay and in-vivo transplantation. Myeloid progenitors were efficiently immortalized in-vitro by AML1/ETO or PML/RAR\u03b1 as assayed in serial replating assays. However, following transplantation into lethally irradiated mice, neither AML1/ETO- nor PML/RAR\u03b1-transduced myeloid progenitors were expanded in-vivo, although cells carrying the fusion gene DNA persisted well beyond their non-transduced control progenitors. In addition, 10 months after the transplant with transduced myeloid progenitor cells, PML/RAR\u03b1 but not AML1/ETO mRNA expression was still detected in committed myeloid progenitors, although PML/RAR\u03b1-expressing cells were still not expanded. This finding demonstrates the ability of PML/RAR\u03b1 to increase the lifespan of committed myeloid progenitor cells both in-vitro and in-vivo and suggest that t(15;17)-APL could possibly evolve from persisting progenitor-derived cells. In contrast, BCR/ABL-expressing myeloid progenitors disappeared within 3 months post transplantation. Analysis of mice transplanted with transduced-HSCs demonstrated that AML1/ETO induced the accumulation of the most immature subset of HSCs (Lin-/c-kit+/Sca-1+/Flk-2-), while in contrast PML/RAR\u03b1 induced HSCs disappearance in most (5 out of 6) cases. In addition, we demonstrate that p210 BCR/ABL could induce the development of a CML-like disease from transduced HSCs (6 out of 16 cases), which is compatible with previous report. Together, these results suggest the existence of novel pre-leukemic stem cells (pre-LSCs) entities. Slowly expanding pre-LSCs could be generated from HSCs transformed by the expression of AML1/ETO. Persisting pre-LSCs could be generated from myeloid progenitors transformed by the expression of PML/RAR\u03b1. These pre-LSC populations could mediate the early phases of t(8;21)-AML and t(15;17)-APL pathogenesis and could represent novel key targets for anti-leukemia therapies."
