    "abstract_text": "Background : Gilteritinib (ASP2215) is a novel, highly selective, potent oral FLT3/AXL inhibitor with preclinical activity against FLT3-ITD activating and FLT3-D835 resistance mutations. The objectives of this phase 1/2 study were to assess gilteritinib safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles after single- and multiple-day dosing, and antileukemic effects in patients with R/R AML. Methods : This open-label study (NCT02014558) enrolled patients (\u226518 yr) into 1 of 7 dose-escalation cohorts (20-450 mg once daily [QD]) or concomitant dose-expansion cohorts. While confirmed FLT3 mutation was not an inclusion criterion, each expanded dose level enrolled \u226510 patients with FLT3 mutations (FLT3 mut+ ); 120 and 200 mg dose levels were further expanded with \u226540 FLT3 mut+ patients. The choice to expand these dose cohorts was based upon FLT3 inhibition in correlative assays and clinical activity seen during dose escalation. Safety and tolerability were primary endpoints; blood samples were drawn from patients in the dose-escalation cohorts to evaluate gilteritinib PK parameters and PD effects. Antileukemic response rates (eg, complete remission [CR], CR with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp], CR with incomplete hematological recovery [CRi], overall response rate [ORR]) were secondary endpoints. Results : Patients (N=252; 129M:123F, median age 62 yr [range: 21-90]) enrolled between October 2013 and August 2015 received \u22651 dose of gilteritinib. The study population was heavily pretreated: 70% (n=177) had \u22652 prior AML therapies, 29% (n=73) had a prior stem cell transplant, and 25% (n=63) had prior TKI treatment with sorafenib most commonly used. Across the study, 194 patients had a locally confirmed FLT3 mutation (ITD, n=159; D835, n=13; ITD-D835, n=16; other, n=6). For all enrolled patients, progressive disease (n=75), lack of efficacy (n=44), adverse events (n=34), and death (n=29) were the most common reasons for treatment discontinuation. Seven deaths were considered possibly/probably related to treatment: pulmonary embolism, respiratory failure, hemoptysis, intracranial bleed, ventricular fibrillation, septic shock, and neutropenia (all n=1). Maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 300 mg when 2 of 3 patients in the 450 mg cohort experienced diarrhea and/or hepatic transaminase elevation as dose-limiting toxicities. Diarrhea (16%) and fatigue (15%) were the most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events of any grade. Less than 5% of patients (11/252) had a maximum post-baseline QTcF interval >500 msec. Gilteritinib concentrations were generally dose proportional and showed both a long-elimination half-life (45-159 h) and substantial accumulation (3.2-10 fold) by day 15. An exposure-related increase in the inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation with increasing doses of gilteritinib was also observed. Gilteritinib showed strong antileukemic activity in FLT3 mut+ patients (ORR=49%); response was observed less frequently in patients with wild-type FLT3 (ORR=12%). While CR, CRi, and CRp occurred at all doses, responses were enriched among FLT3 mut+ patients with gilteritinib steady-state trough concentrations \u2265100 ng/mL, which correlated with potent FLT3 inhibition in PD assays and corresponded to doses \u226580 mg. The ORR in 169 FLT3 mut+ patients receiving \u226580 mg was 52% ( Table ); median overall survival in this patient population was ~31 wk (range: 1.7-61; Figure ) and median duration of response was 20 wk (range: 1.1-55). Clinical responses occurred in FLT3 mut+ patients with -ITD, -D835, and both mutations (ORR: 55%, 17%, and 62%, respectively) as well as in FLT3 mut+ patients with or without prior TKI treatment (ORR: 42% vs 56%, respectively). Conclusions : This PD-driven, first-in-human study shows that gilteritinib was well tolerated and generated frequent, prolonged, clinically important responses in FLT3 mut+ patients with R/R AML. Antileukemic responses were enriched in FLT3 mut+ patients treated at doses that consistently and potently inhibited FLT3 phosphorylation. The survival of these patients appears better than expected for this patient population when treated with standard therapy. Our data suggest that FLT3 inhibition may improve survival in patients with FLT3 mut+ R/R AML; as such, phase 3 testing of oral gilteritinib 120 mg QD in patients with FLT3 mut+ R/R AML after first-line therapy is underway (NCT02421939).
