    "abstract_text": "Here we present the clinical results and the outcomes of 143 consecutive newly-diagnosed follicular lymphoma (FL) patients (pts) treated with 3 different modalities of treatment in our institution from 1994 until 2007. During this period, from 1994 to 2002, 55 pts received Chlorambucil and Prednisone (Chl+PDN), subsequently 31 pts Rituximab with Chlorambucil (R-Chl) and 57 pts a 4-weekly standard-dose of Rituximab alone (R). Chlorambucil was given in an induction phase at 10mg/day for 6 consecutive weeks followed by a longer maintenance phase in the first group: 2-week pulses of 10 mg daily with 2-week intervals for a total of 12-months of treatment versus four 2-week pulses with monthly-Rituximab. In the single agent R group 36 pts received maintenance with at least 4-bimonthly administrations. The 3 groups were comparable for demographic and prognostic factors: median age at diagnosis was 55 yrs, over 60% of pts were in advanced stages and mainly asyptomatic (about 90%) and over 50% of pts in each group were low-risk FLIPI. A third of pts in both Rituximab-based treatment groups had bone marrow involvement and bulky disease. In terms of ORR 78% of pts treated with Chl+PDN, 97% with R-Chl and 72% with R single agent, obtained a clinical response, with a percentage of complete response of 58%, 90% and 47% respectively. No significant incidence of adverse events were reported and none discontinued the therapy because of toxicity. One case of myelodysplatic syndrome was described in a relapsed patient of the Chl-PDN group. With a median follow up of 72, 56 and 27 months in the 3 groups evaluated, the CR rate was maintained in 29%, 74% and 37% of pts respectively with a median duration of response of 36, 40 and 24 months. Rituximab as first-line in FL pts seems safe, feasible and able to induce a high rate of clinical response similar to those achieved with standard chemotherapy alone. On the other hand, the immunochemotherapy seems to confirm its superiority in terms of response rate and duration of response.",
