    "abstract_text": "Background L-asparaginase (LASP) depletion of asparagine reduces antithrombin (AT) and fibrinogen and is associated with thromboembolic (TE) and hemorrhagic events (HE). AT replacement in pediatric ALL patients demonstrated safety and potential benefit as thromboprophylaxis in a prospective, randomized trial.(Mitchell et al , 2003) Current consensus supports AT replacement when AT activity is below 60%.(Stock et al , 2011) The incidence of TE and HE in adults receiving AT repletion during LASP or pegylated asparaginase (PEGASP) requires further investigation. Methods This single center, retrospective, observational study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board. Consecutive adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of ALL receiving LASP or PEGASP containing chemotherapy regimens between January 2000 and October 2012 were evaluated. Patients with documented thrombophilia and pre-existing TE or HE were excluded. Patients receiving AT concentrate (ATC) compared to those that did not and were evaluated up to 60 days after the last LASP or PEGASP dose for objectively confirmed TE and HE. Results Of the 74 patients screened, 54 (73%) met inclusion criteria. Forty-seven (87%) received ATC and were evaluable. The remaining 7 (13%) did not meet follow up duration and were excluded from further analysis. Twenty-three (49%) patients received LASP, 20 (42%) received PEGASP and 4 (9%) received both. Distribution per treatment protocols was; CALGB 9111 (n=16 (34%), Larson et al, 1998), E2993 (n=12 (25%), Goldstone et al , 2008), C10403 (n=8 (17%), NLM: NCT00558519), CCG 1941 (n=6 (13%), Gaynon et al , 2006) and Augmented HyperCVAD (n=5 (11%), Faderl et al, 2011). A total of 1465 AT activity levels were analyzed, resulting in 378 doses of ATC. Ten patients (21%) experienced a clinical event, with all events occurring during cycle 1 of chemotherapy ( table 1 ). Median time from last LASP or PEGASP dose to TE was 13 days (range 3-56) with a median of 4 days (range 3-13) from last ATC dose to TE. Median AT activity level at time of TE was 56% (range 47-72). Thrombotic events included; line-related deep vein thrombosis (LRDVT, n=7), cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST, n=1) and pulmonary embolism (PE, n=1). One patient with cerebral hemorrhage constituted the only HE. All LRDVT occurred in central venous catheters and management included; line removal (n=3), anticoagulation (n=1), line removal and anticoagulation (n=2) and no intervention (n=1). The single case of PE was managed with anticoagulation. Two patients had a recurrent LRDVT in different locations during subsequent chemotherapy in spite of ongoing ATC supplementation.

LRDVT was the most common TE with a comparable incidence to adult ALL patients not receiving ATC (15%) (Grace et al 2011). There was a small incidence of non-LRDVT (4%) and HE (2%). As induction-phase chemotherapy and placement of central lines are independent risk factors for thrombosis, the cost-effectiveness of AT replacement for prevention of TE during adult ALL treatment requires prospective evaluation.
