    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: There is high unmet need in frail pts with relapsed CLL, particularly in those characterized by adverse prognostic factors such as presence of del(17p) and/or TP53 mutations. Idelalisib is a first-in-class, targeted, highly selective, oral inhibitor of PI3Kd recently approved for the treatment of relapsed CLL in combination with R. This report describes results from the 2 nd interim analysis (IA) of a Phase 3 study evaluating IDELA in combination with R in relapsed CLL with focus on various risk subgroups of pts. METHODS : A Phase 3 study evaluated IDELA+R vs placebo (PBO)+R in pts with CLL requiring therapy after progression <24 mos since last therapy and considered unfit to receive cytotoxic therapy. Pts were randomized to receive IDELA at 150 BID (n=110) or PBO (n=110) in combination with R at 375 mg/m2 [1 st dose] and then 500 mg/m 2 q2 wks x 4, followed by q4 wks x 3 [8 doses total]). After progression, pts could enroll into a blinded extension study to receive IDELA at 150 mg BID (prior PBO+R) or 300 mg BID (prior IDELA+R). Primary endpoint PFS was assessed by an IRC using standard criteria (Hallek 2008/2012, Cheson 2012). The first IA (Furman, NEJM 2014) led to an early stop due to overwhelming efficacy. The 2 nd IA was conducted at end of the blinded phase according to protocol (data cut-off Oct 9, 2013 with 63% of total PFS events) (Coutre, ASCO 2014). Samples for genetic analyses were analyzed by a central lab. RESULTS : 220 pts (110/group) with median age of 71 yrs (78% \u226565 yrs), median time since diagnosis of 8.5 yrs, and median number of 3 prior therapies (range: 1-12) were randomized. 43% had del(17p)/TP53 mutation and 84% had unmutated IGHV. At the time of data cut-off, the median (range) exposure was 5 (0-17) mos on IDELA+R and 4 (0-15) mos on PBO+R. 76% of pts on IDELA+R and 46% of pts on PBO+R were continuing on study. Median PFS was not reached for pts on IDELA+R and was 5.5 mos for pts on the comparator arm. At 12 months, the PFS rates for pts on IDELA treatment was 66% compared to 13% for pts on PBO+R. PFS strongly favored IDELA+R in all risk-subgroups, including those with genetic risk factors such as del(17p)/ TP53 mutations, del(11q) (FIGURE 1) or unmutated IGHV as well as with disease-related risk factors like advance Rai stage or high levels of \u03b22-microglobulin. Adverse events (any Gr/Gr \u22653) occurring in \u226520% of pts on IDELA treatment were: pyrexia (IDELA+R 35%/3%; PBO+R 17%/1%), fatigue (IDELA+R 28%/3%; PBO+R 27%/2%), nausea (IDELA+R 26%/0%; PBO+R 21/0%), chills (IDELA+R 21%/2%; PBO+R 16%/0%), diarrhea/colitis (IDELA+R 21%/5%; PBO+R 15%/0%). ALT/AST elevation (any Gr/Gr \u22653) occurred in 40%/8% of pts on IDELA+R and in 20%/1% of pts on PBO+R. At the time of this analysis, 19 total deaths had occurred on the primary study: 6 on IDELA+R and 13 on PBO+R.

IDELA+R without these risk factors: median PFS 12.1 mos (74% at 12 mos); IDELA+R with these risk factors: median PFS not reached (62% at 12 mos); PBO+R without these risk factors: median PFS 8.2 mos (19% at 12 mos); and PBO+R with these risk factors: median PFS 4 mos (8% at 12 mos). Curve comparison: Pts with these risk factors: HR = 0.16 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.32); Pts without these risk factors: HR = 0.24 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.66). FIGURE 1: View large Download slide KM estimates of PFS in pts with del(17p) or TP53mutation or del(11q) vs pts without any of these factors. IDELA+R without these risk factors: median PFS 12.1 mos (74% at 12 mos); IDELA+R with these risk factors: median PFS not reached (62% at 12 mos); PBO+R without these risk factors: median PFS 8.2 mos (19% at 12 mos); and PBO+R with these risk factors: median PFS 4 mos (8% at 12 mos).

CONCLUSIONS: IDELA+R demonstrated statistically significant improvement over PBO+R in PFS, ORR, and OS with an acceptable safety profile in these frail pts with relapsed CLL. These results confirm the 1 st interim analysis of comparable efficacy of IDELA+R across all risk groups, including those with high-risk genomic markers like del(17p), TP53 mutations, and del(11q).
