    "abstract_text": "Background Inhibitor development is the most severe complication of hemophilia A care, and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Aims The aim of this study was to use a novel epitope mapping method to explore the factor VIII (FVIII)-specific epitope profile in the SIPPET cohort population. Methods The population consisted of 122 previously untreated patients with severe hemophilia A that were followed-up for 50 days of exposure to FVIII. Sampling was performed before FVIII treatment and at the end of the follow-up. The outcome was inhibitor development. The FVIII-specific IgG epitope repertoire was assessed by means of a novel high-throughput epitope mapping technique using a random peptide phage-display library. Using this assay, a set of affinity-selected 12-mer peptide sequences (also called mimotopes) that were strongly bound by FVIII-specific antibodies were identified. These mimotopes were clustered on the basis of sequence similarity and a consensus motif was generated for each mimotope cluster. Discriminative performance of these mimotope clusters was assessed by ROC analysis. Mimotope clusters were mapped onto the 3D structure of a B-domain deleted FVIII model using a B-cell epitope prediction algorithm (Mapitope). Results The FVIII-specific antibody response is polyclonal with several mimotope clusters. The most predominant mimotope clusters in inhibitor patients were mapped to the heavy chain of the FVIII molecule. Using plasma samples taken before exposure to FVIII, three mimotopes (with the consensus motifs \"QM\", \"PSLxWK\" and \"SWPHxxxxK\") were identified that predicted inhibitor development (with an AUC of 0.76, 0.80 and 0.76 respectively). Conclusion Information on immunodominant epitope clusters can be used to generate novel, less immunogenic FVIII proteins and set up diagnostic tests that predict the risk of inhibitor development before starting treatment with FVIII.
