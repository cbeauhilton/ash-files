    "abstract_text": "Background: Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) has improved markedly overtime. This study aims to assess our experience in treating advanced HL. Method: In a retrospective cohort study, patients age >14 with advanced HL from 2007-2010 were included. Using IPI, patients were categorized into low and high risk. ABVD and Hybrid ABVD+BEACOPP regimens were used. Result: 74 patients were included with the median age at diagnosis of 25.5 years. 50% presented with stage IV. Two different protocols were used (ABVD and Hybrid ABVD + BEACOPP). Median follow up was 30.3 months. Male gender and stage V were most often to receive hybrid regimen (odd ratio 3.74 and 6.58 respectively). When the two groups were compared, the higher risk group (mostly treated with hybrid regimen) showed similar survival rates to the lower risk group (treated mostly with ABVD) with p-values of 0.41 for OS and 0.42 for PFS. Conclusion: This study shows quite similar results to the published studies in the OS and PFS with a tendency to overcome the high-risk features by the hybrid regimen in advanced HL. However, this needs to be confirmed in a prospective randomized study. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
