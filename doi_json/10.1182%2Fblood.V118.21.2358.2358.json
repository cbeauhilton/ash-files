    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2358 Absence of Gfi1b in mice is embryonically lethal and causes failure to produce functional megakaryocytes and platelets. Thrombopoiesis, the production of platelets by megakaryocytes, is an essential process in hemostasis that needs to be well controlled. Too many platelets can cause thrombosis, too few cause excessive bleeding. How terminal megakaryocyte maturation and platelet release works is incompletely understood but requires many factors such as Fli1, Gata1, MyH9, p45-NFE2, or c-Myc. Expression array analysis of hematopoietic cells from conditionally Gfi1b deficient mice (Gfi1b fl/fl Mx-Cre) revealed an up-regulation of many factors important for megakaryocyte function like Itga2b, Itgb3, CD9, CD41, CD61, PF4 and Ppbp. Gfi1b ablation in adult Gfi1b fl/fl Mx-Cre mice leads to a severe drop in platelet counts to less than 20% of wt mice with an increase in mean platelet volume (MPV) by 40%. However, megakaryocyte numbers rise up to 100 fold over normal levels when Gfi1b is absent. FACS analysis of bone marrow cells of Gfi1b deficient mice showed a higher number of MEPs, a higher proportion of smaller megakaryocytes and an aberrant population of cKit hi CD41 hi CD9 veryhi cells, which are not present in wt animals. Gfi1b \u2212/\u2212 megakaryocytes can reach wt size and normal ploidy as shown by FACS analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of pIpC induced Gfi1b fl/fl Mx-Cre megakaryocytes revealed an excess number and larger size of so called \u201cdemarcation membranes\u201d in unusual parallel layers and a strongly reduced number of dense granula. Strikingly, both intact and fragmented megakaryocytes were frequently found within bone marrow blood vessels in Gfi1b \u2212/\u2212 mice. In addition, a high percentage of megakaryocytes were found in a state of disintegration, without signs of proper platelet release. These features are rarely seen in wt mice. It is known that Gfi1b is required for erythropoiesis and Gfi1b fl/fl Mx-Cre mice show signs of anemia and stress erythropoiesis, which might explain high MEP numbers, which could explain the high numbers of megakaryocytes. To better define the function of Gfi1b in late stage megakaryocyte development, we decided to abrogate Gfi1b expression more specifically by using mice that express Cre recombinase under the megakaryocyte specific promoter of the PF4 gene (PF4-Cre). We observed that Gfi1b fl/fl PF4-Cre mice develop a very severe thrombocytopenia reaching only 2% of wt platelet counts in peripheral blood accompanied by an increase of MPV by 80% over wt levels. Most of Gfi1b fl/fl PF4-Cre mice died at 6\u20138 weeks of age from severe internal bleedings. Megakaryocyte numbers increase in these mice by 5 to 10 fold and they also reach high ploidy, but their morphology is highly disturbed. Gfi1b fl/fl PF4-Cre megakaryocytes contain less cytoplasm, few dense granula organized in a small patch and a lobulated, ring-shaped nucleus localized close to the cell membrane giving the cells an almost \u201cinside-out\u201d appearance and indicating a disturbed cytoskeleton organization. Gfi1b fl/fl PF4-Cre mice show a stress induced splenic erythropoiesis and an increase in MEP numbers, probably a consequence of their substantial hemorrhaging owing to the low platelet counts. The high MEPs number might explain the increase in megakaryocytes in these mice compared to wt controls. Immunofluorescence analysis of Gfi1b fl/fl PF4-Cre megakaryocytes compared to wt counterparts showed less expression of van Willebrand factor (vWF), an important regulator of thrombopoiesis. Q-PCR analysis on mRNA from sorted Gfi1b fl/fl PF4-Cre wt megakaryocytes revealed a lower expression of vWF, but higher PF4, very high Mpl and high CCNE1 expression. Our data show that Gfi1b controls the production of platelets from megakaryocytes, but does not affect the maturation of megakaryocytes as such. However, Gfi1b is required to maintain the cellular organelle structure in megakaryocytes and, more specifically is required to control the formation of dense granula and demarcation membrane formation. Gfi1b ablation in megakaryocytes results in a phenotype with high similarities to Gata1-low mice and syndromes involving mutations in the Gata1 target Gpib, the receptor for vWF, causing Bernhard-Soulier Syndrome (BBS). It is thus possible that Gfi1b is another candidate gene involved in megakaryocyte related diseases. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
