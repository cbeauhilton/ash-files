    "abstract_text": "L-Asparaginase is an effective drug for treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The effectiveness is generally thought to result from a rapid depletion of asparagine in serum and cells. Several studies have shown that in vitro resistance to this drug is an independent prognostic factor in ALL. We investigated the clinical response of one in vivo dose of 1000 IU/m2 PEG-Asparaginase and its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects in children with newly diagnosed ALL before the start of combination chemotherapy. 57 children (36M / 21F) were enrolled in the study: 2 pro B-ALL, 38 common/ pre B-ALL and 17 T-ALL. Genotyping of precursor B-ALL revealed 11 hyperdiploid, 8 TELAML1 positive, 2 BCRABL positive, no MLL rearrangement, 8 normal, 11 others. The clinical response to PEG-Asparaginase on day 0 (5 days after the PEG-Asparaginase infusion) was defined as good when the number of leukemic cells of peripheral blood was < 1 \u00d7 109/L, as intermediate when leukemic cells were 1-10 \u00d7 109/L, and as poor when leukemic cells were > 10 \u00d7 109/L. The in vivo window response was significantly related to immunophenotype and genotype: 26/38 common / pre B-ALL cases, especially those with hyperdiploidy and TELAML1 rearrangement, demonstrated a good clinical response compared to 8/17 T-ALL (p=0.01). Both BCRABL positive ALL cases showed a poor response (p=0.04). A poor in vivo clinical window response was related to in vitro resistance to L-Asparaginase (p=0.02) and both in vitro as well as in vivo response were prognostic factors for long-term event-free survival (Hazard ratio 6.4; p=0.004, and Hazard ratio 3.7; p=0.01, respectively). The L-Asparaginase activity in the serum was >100 IU/L for at least 15 days. The asparagine levels remained below the detection limit of 0.2 mM for at least 26 days with a concomitant rise in serum aspartate and glutamate. These findings confirm that PEG-Asparaginase will yield its pharmacodynamic effects for 2-4 weeks. After administration of one in vivo dose of 1000 IU/m2 PEG-Asparaginase no changes in apoptotic parameters or changes in intracellular levels of twenty amino acids in leukemic cells could be measured, in contradiction to the changes found after in vitro exposure. This may be explained by the rapid removal of apoptotic cells from the circulation in vivo. Otherwise it is possible that in vivo mesenchymal cells from the bone marrow supply leukemic blasts with asparagine in response to treatment with L-Asparaginase. Conclusion: The clinical response to one dose of 1000 IU/m2 PEG-Asparaginase intravenously is related to phenotype and genotype and predicts outcome. These results suggest that children with ALL with a poor clinical response to PEG-Asparaginase might benefit from a more intensive antileukemic therapy."
