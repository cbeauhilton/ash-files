    "abstract_text": "Background Achieving a complete remission (CR) in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and an anthracycline (7+3) remains an important treatment goal associated with better overall survival (OS). Approximately 25-30% of younger, and up to 50% of older patients (pts) fail to achieve CR. AML pts with residual leukemia at day 14 receive a second cycle of the same regimen; whether these pts have worse survival than pts not requiring re-induction is unclear. Information on pts with primary refractory AML and the best treatment strategy in this setting are limited. Methods Pts with newly diagnosed AML treated at our institution between 1/2000 and 1/2015 were included. Pts received standard induction chemotherapy with cytarabine for 7 days and an anthracycline for 3 days (7+3). Bone marrow biopsies were obtained at day 14 and a second cycle of the same regimen (7+3 for younger adults, 5+2 for older adults) was given to pts with residual leukemia (blasts > 5%). All responses were assessed at day 30 +/- 5 days post induction. Response was defined as CR and CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) or platelet recovery (CRp) per International Working Group (IWG) 2003 response criteria. Cytogenetic risk stratifications were based on CALGB/Alliance criteria. OS was calculated from the time of diagnosis to time of death or last follow up. A panel of 62 gene mutations that have been described as recurrent mutations in myeloid malignancies was used to evaluate whether genomic data can be used to predict response. Results: Among 227 pts with AML, 123 received 7+3 and had clinical and mutational data available. Median age was 60 years (range, 23-82). Median baseline WBC was 8.2 X 10 9 /L (range, 0.3-227), hemoglobin 8.9 g/L (range, 4.7-13.8), platelets 47 X 10 9 /L (range, 9-326), and BM blasts 46% (range, 20-95). Cytogenetic risk groups were: favorable in 12 (10%), intermediate in 68 (56%) [normal karyotype in 44 (36%)], and unfavorable in 42 (34%). A total of 93 pts (76%) responded, 69 (74%) received 1 cycle of induction and 24 (26%) required re-induction at day 14 due to residual leukemia. A total of 39 pts (32%) received allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT): 18 (46%) from a matched sibling donor, 16 (41%) from a matched unrelated donor and 5 (13%) had an umbilical cord transplant. With a median follow up of 13.5 months, the median OS for the entire group was 13 months (m, range, 0.1-120). The median OS for pts who failed 1-2 cycles of 7+3 was significantly worse than pts who responded (median 2.6 vs 16.9 m, p = 0.002). When pts undergoing ASCT were censored, the median OS was 2.3 vs 9.9 m, p= 0.003, respectively. Overall, 33 pts (27%) had residual leukemia at day 14 and received re-induction, 24 (72%) achieved a response at day 30+/- 5 days. The median OS for pts who received re-induction was inferior compared to pts who did not (10.1 vs. 16.1 months, p= 0.02). When pts who received ASCT were censored, the OS was similar (8.5 vs. 7.4 months, p = 0.49, respectively). Among the 30 pts with persistent disease following induction therapy at day 30, 11 (37%) died from induction complications, 6 (20%) received salvage therapy with mitoxantrone/etoposide/cytarabine, 3 (10%) received high dose cytarabine, 2 (7%) received azacitidine, and 8 (27%) received best supportive care. Among pts who received salvage chemotherapy 56% achieved CR and proceeded with ASCT. Two pts had ASCT with residual leukemia and relapsed within 3 m of ASCT. Pts who received ASCT after induction failure had a significantly better OS compared to non-transplant pts (median OS 22.0 vs. 1.4 months, p < 0.001, respectively); however, this benefit was only seen in pts who had ASCT in CR. We then investigated if genomic mutations can predict response or resistance to chemotherapy. Out of the 62 genes tested, only a TP53 mutation was associated with resistance, p = 0.02. Further, pts with TP53 mutations had significantly inferior OS compared to TP53 wild type regardless of ASCT status (1.4 vs 14.8 m, p< 0.001) Conclusion: Pts with newly diagnosed AML who fail induction chemotherapy with a 7+3 regimen have a poor outcome. Re-induction with the same regimen at day 14 for residual leukemia converted most non-responders to responders, but was associated with worse OS. ASCT improves outcome only in pts who achieve CR with salvage therapy. TP53 mutations predicted resistance to chemotherapy with 7+3. Disclosures Carew: Boehringer Ingelheim: Research Funding.
