    "abstract_text": "Introduction Carfilzomib-based induction therapy is highly effective in newly diagnosed pts with multiple myeloma (NDMM), but information on quality of life (QoL) during first line and maintenance therapy is not available. Here, we analyze patient-reported QoL in transplant-non eligible (TNE) NDMM pts randomized to either KTd or KRd induction therapy followed by second randomization to carfilzomib maintenance, or control. Patients and Methods At time of analysis, 101 TNE pts with NDMM had been enrolled, but QoL data documented for \u2265 2 cycles were available in 78 pts so far (median age: 75 years, ISS stage I: 26.6%, II: 35.4%, III: 38.0%, ECOG status 0: 51.9%, 1: 48.1%). Patients were randomized to either 9 cycles KTd or KRd, and subsequently (46 pts with \u2265PR) to either carfilzomib maintenance therapy (d1 and 15) or to control for 12 months. Carfilzomib was administered twice weekly (27mg/m 2 ) during cycles 1 and 2, and thereafter weekly at a dose of 56mg/m 2 . Thalidomide was given daily at 100mg (50mg in pts \u226575 years), lenalidomide at 25mg, d1-21 per 4 week cycle, and dexamethasone at 40 mg (20mg in pts \u00b375 years) once weekly. QoL was assessed by the QoL questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30. Assessments were done at baseline, and monthly thereafter for 21 months. A two-sided t-test was used for comparison with the general population. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were applied to evaluate differences in QoL dimensions within the treatment groups. A clinically meaningful improvement has been defined as a change of \u226510 score points. Results Comparison with the general population : Mean scores for health-related global QoL (54.1\u00b122.6) and physical functioning (61.2\u00b125.0) were significantly lower in pts compared to those reported for the general population of similar age (67.2\u00b120.6, p<0.001, and 80.6\u00b119.7, p<0.001, respectively) (Nolte S et al., Eur. J. Cancer 2019). Induction therapy: Health-related global QoL showed a clinically relevant improvement during carfilzomib-based induction therapy in both treatment groups (KRd: 54.5\u00b119.9 to 65.0\u00b120.2, p=0.10, KTd 53.6\u00b124.8 to 68.2 \u00b1 19.4, p=0.04), but a statistically significant increase in score points was noted in the KTd arm only. For physical functioning, a clinically relevant improvement was noted solely in pts on KRd, but the increase was not statistically significant (59.2 \u00b1 22 to 73.2 \u00b1 23.8, p=0.15), while during KTd no relevant changes were noted. Further clinically relevant improvements during induction therapy were observed for role functioning (KTd: 45 \u00b1 39.3 to 61.6 \u00b1 33.5, p=0.08, KRD: 51.5 \u00b1 34.9 to 66.7 \u00b1 30.1, p=0.29), emotional functioning (KTd: 61.2 \u00b1 27.4 to 73.2 \u00b1 20.5, p=0.04, KRd: 58.3 \u00b1 23.2 to 73 \u00b1 26.7, p=0.10), and pain with a statistically significant decrease in respective scores in both arms (KTd: 47.7 \u00b1 37.4, to 24.2 \u00b1 26.1, p=0.01, KRd: 54.8 \u00b1 33.2 to 20.8 \u00b1 21.5, p<0.001)(Figure 1). Neuropathy, however, worsened clinically relevant and statistically significant in KTd treated pts (15.4 \u00b1 24 to 27.8 \u00b1 26.4, p=0.03), while during KRd treatment, no change was noted (22.2\u00b130.8 to 22.2\u00b128.0, p=0.66). Likewise, no changes were observed for nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, fatigue, and cognitive function, while a clinically relevant improvement in social function was noted in pts during KRd induction (66.2\u00b131.4 to 80.8\u00b127.7, p=0.13). Maintenance phase: Pts randomized to carfilzomib maintenance showed no clinically relevant change in health-related QoL score (70.3\u00b1 17 to 63.9\u00b125.3), similar to the findings in the untreated controls, which showed a clinically not relevant improvement in scores (66.7.\u00b121.0 to 75.9\u00b118.8). The scores for physical functioning remained rather stable during the maintenance period and values at end of therapy or observation appeared similar between the carfilzomib (77.1\u00b121.6) and the control group (83.7\u00b125.4). Conclusion Health-related global QoL and physical functioning in our pts with TNE NDMM was significantly impaired at start of therapy compared to the general population. During carfilzomib-based induction TX, clinically meaningful improvements in health-related global QoL, physical (only in KTd), emotional, role, and social (only in KRd) functioning, and pain were achieved. Neuropathy worsened during KTd. Maintenance treatment with carfilzomib was well tolerated without a clinically relevant change during the treatment period or statistical significant difference to the untreated controls.
