    "abstract_text": "Oral mucositis (OM) is a common complication in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy (CT). OM is characterized by damage to the epithelium of the oral-pharyngeal cavity. CG53135-05, a recombinant human fibroblastic growth factor 20 (rhFGF-20) protein, has demonstrated epithelial and mesenchymal cell proliferation stimulating activity in vitro and reduces OM using single doses in a hamster mucositis model. The goal of this dose-escalating tolerance study was to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of CG53135-05 in cohorts of four patients (pts) at 0.03, 0.1, 0.33, and 1mg/kg (concentrations are determined by the UV method which are equivalent to 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg by the Bradford method previously used). Dose escalation was stopped due to tolerability information at 0.33 mg/kg delivered in 15 min (reported in another Phase I study) and the protocol was amended to add a 0.2 mg/kg dose. The World Health Organization (WHO) OM and OMAS scoring systems were used to measure the incidence and severity of OM. The interim results are reported: Ten pts received CG53135-05 at 0.03 mg/kg (n=4) or 0.1 mg/kg (n=6) as a single 100-ml intravenous infusion administered 3 days after completion of the CT. After infusion, CG53135-05 reached maximum plasma concentration within 1h. The mean terminal exponential half-life was 49 min (range: 16.2\u201387 min, n=5). No pts discontinued the trial due to adverse experiences. Adverse events (number pts) that may be related to the study drug include: nausea (2); chills (2); fever (2); vomiting (1); dizziness (1); vision - \u201clights flashing\u201d (1) and astigmatism (1); neuropathy (1); tachycardia (1); headache (1); and premature atrial complex (1). All reported incidences were mild to moderate. No grade 3 or 4 laboratory toxicity associated with the study drug was noted. Three serious adverse events deemed unrelated to study drug were noted from two pts including cancer progression, catheter infection, and small intestinal obstruction. Among the treated pts, no grade 3 or 4 OM was observed. Three pts developed Grade 2 mucositis that lasted between 1\u20135 days. No pts required total parenteral nutrition. Approximately 72\u201384% of pts receiving CPT-11 experience diarrhea. Of the six pts who received CPT-11 as part of CT in this trial, two pts (both receiving 0.03mg/kg of CG53135-05) experienced mild to moderate diarrhea. Conclusions: CG53135-05 is well tolerated with single dose administration at 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg. Dosing at 0.2 mg/kg is ongoing. The full results of this study will be presented."
