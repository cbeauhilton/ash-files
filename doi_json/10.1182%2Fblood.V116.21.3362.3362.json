The aim of the current study was to investigate the spectrum of chromosomal abnormalities in East Asian (Korean) patients with acute leukemia. Based on the spectrum of genetic aberrations found in our study, we proposed a revised list of chromosomal aberrations for the development of optimal profiles of leukemic fusion genes in multiplex RT-PCR system. Patients and Method: We prospectively analyzed blood or bone marrow samples from 348 patients (260 adults, 88 children) with leukemia from 2006 to 2009 at the Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital (Hwasun, Korea). Simultaneous analyses of conventional cytogenetics, FISH and a commercially available multiplex RT-PCR system (HemaVision) were performed. Result: Thirty-six types of chromosomal abnormalities were found in the total patient population. Twenty types of chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 42% of all patients by multiplex RT-PCR system and in 33% of all patients by conventional cytogenetics including FISH. Within the group of 213 AML patients, the common cytogenetic abnormalities were t(15;17)(q21;q22) (n=35), t(8;21)(q22;q22) (n=31), 11q23 abnormalities (n=7), inv(16)(p13;q22) (n=3), t(9;9)(q34:q34) (n=2), and the abnormalities t(9;22)(q34;q11), t(9;12)(q34;p13), t(3;21)(q26;q22), t(11;17)(q23;q21), t(12;22)(p13;q11) and t(16;21)(p11.2;q22.3) were each involved in one case. In the group of 104 ALL patients, the following fusion transcripts were detected: 21 t(9;22)(q34;q11), 15 t(12;21)(p13;q22), nine 11q23 abnormalities, four t(1;19)(q23;p13), with t(9;9)(q34:q34), t(9;12)(q34;p13) and del(1p34) each involved in one case. In addition, cryptic translocations were detected in 9% of patients with normal karyotypes or numerical aberrations by conventional cytogenetics. Among 53 patients showing negative results for multiplex RT-PCR, one child patient with early pre-B-ALL harbored MLL1/AF4 fusion genes and 5 patients had 3 types of clinically significant chromosomal aberrations such as t(3;3)(q21;q26.2), t(8;14)(p24.1;q32) and i(17)(q10). Conclusion: The current study demonstrated the spectrum and frequency of chromosomal abnormalities in Korean leukemia patients, which were slightly differed from previous studies including western and some Asian countries. These results may offer important implications in understanding characteristics of molecular pathophysiology, the development of a new RT-PCR system as well as revision of the current commercial available RT-PCR system.
