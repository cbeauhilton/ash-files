    "abstract_text": "DNA hypermethylation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Most of the recurrent driver mutations and chromosomal translocations in AML involve genes encoding chromatin modifiers and DNA methylation relevant enzymes. Hypo-methylating drugs such as 5-Azacytidine (AZA) that target DNMTs prolong overall survival in AML patients. However, their long term treatments lead to emergence of acquired therapy resistance mostly through unknown mechanisms and hence there is an urgent need for alternate therapeutics to address AZA resistance in AML patients. Recently, it has been shown that AZA resistant leukemic cells are relatively quiescent with higher expression of many components of DNA methylation machinery that also includes UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 1). UHRF1 is a key epigenetic modulator that regulates DNA methylation and gene expression. It is a multi-domain nuclear protein with an SRA (SET-and-RING-associated) domain to recognize hemi-methylated DNA immediately after replication. It plays a crucial role in the maintenance of DNA methylation by recruiting DNMT1 to replication sites and facilitates methylation on newly synthesized DNA strand. UHRF1 is frequently overexpressed in multiple human neoplasms including AML and in the absence of UHRF1, hematopoietic stem cells undergo erythroid-biased differentiation at the expense of self-renewal capacity. Despite UHRF1 being key a therapeutic target against AML, specific, and cell-permeable inhibitors of UHRF1 have not been identified yet. In this study, we hypothesized that targeting UHRF1 using novel small molecule inhibitor will interfere with DNMT1-dependent DNA methylation at newly synthesized DNA strand, which may further synergize with antiproliferative effect of classical DNMT inhibitors in AML cells. In this study, we used in silico strategy to discover novel putative UHRF1 inhibitors by screening NCI compound database. For in vitro validation, we have first purified the SRA domain of UHRF1 followed by analysis of total DNA methylation levels using 5'-methyl cytosine (5mC) dot blot in the presence of each inhibitor. After a series of stringent in vitro and cell based assays we have identified lead compound 20 (C20) as a potent UHRF1 inhibitor which suppresses DNA methylation without affecting DNMTs in leukemic cells. Specificity of C20 against SRA domain was further established by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). We next found that C20 treatment significantly decreased UHRF1 and DNMT1 foci formation in the nucleus of mouse embryonic fibroblast and stem cells. Based on the its critical role in DNA methylation and enhanced expression in resistant cells, we assumed that AZA resistance in AML may be mediated by UHRF1 and C20 might restore AZA sensitivity by attenuating enhanced UHRF1 activity. To validate this, we pretreated AZA resistant leukemic cells (HL60R) with suboptimal dose of C20 followed by AZA treatment. Interestingly, we found a synergistic increase in antiproliferative effect by flow cytometry and colony formation assay. By analyzing the surface expression of myeloid differentiation markers, we found that C20 treatment promotes differentiation and decreases quiescent leukemic cell population. In conclusion, we report a novel UHRF1 inhibitor as a sensitizer of resistant AML cells towards AZA treatment potentially by promoting differentiation, suggesting a novel combination approach for future clinical evaluations.
