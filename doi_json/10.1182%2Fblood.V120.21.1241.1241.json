    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1241 Erythropoiesis is a multi-step process during which hematopoietic stem cells terminally differentiate into red blood cells (RBCs). Erythropoietin (EPO) is the only known cytokine regulator of terminal erythroid differentiation. Previously, we reported that the neuropeptide, neuromedin U (NmU), which interacts with NmU receptor type 1 (NMUR1), functions as a novel extracellular cofactor with EPO to promote the expansion of early erythroblasts, which are CD34 \u2212 , CD71 + , glycophorin A (GlyA) dim (Gambone et al, Blood. 2011). Here, we describe studies to understand the mechanism whereby NmU augments EPO effects on erythroid cell growth. EPO triggers Janus kinase (Jak)-2 dependent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to promote the proliferation and/or survival of erythroid progenitor cells. We hypothesized that NmU peptide would cooperate with EPO to promote the proliferation of early erythroblasts through STAT5 and/or PI3K activation. To address this hypothesis, we cultured primary human CD34 + cells in 2-stage liquid culture with IL-3, IL-6, and stem cell factor (SCF) from day 0 to day 6. On day 6, 2U/mL of EPO was added, and the cells were cultured for an additional 5 days to expand erythroid progenitors. On day 11, cells were briefly serum starved and then stimulated with EPO and/or NmU in the absence or presence of a Jak-1/2 inhibitor. Activation of STAT5 and S6, a surrogate marker for PI3K activation, were assessed by phospho-flow in ERY3 (CD34 \u2212 , CD71 + , GlyA + ) and ERY4 (CD34 \u2212 , CD71 dim , GlyA + ) cells. As expected, EPO alone activated STAT5 and S6 in ERY3 cells only, and the presence of a Jak-1/2 inhibitor diminished STAT5 activation. Interestingly, STAT5 and S6 were activated by NmU peptide alone in ERY3 and ERY4. Surprisingly, in the presence of a Jak-1/2 inhibitor, NmU peptide, which binds to NMUR1 a G-protein coupled receptor, did not activate STAT5 or S6 in ERY3 or 4 cells, suggesting that NmU functions through a JAK kinase in erythroid cells. No additive or synergistic activation of STAT5 and S6 is observed in the presence of both EPO and NmU peptide when EPO was used at a dose of 2 U/mL. The mechanism whereby NmU activates a JAK dependent signaling pathway is under investigation. Preliminary evidence suggests that EPO induces the physical association of NMUR1 with EPO receptor (EPOR). Taken together, we propose that NmU is a neuropeptide expressed in bone marrow cells that cooperates to regulate erythroid expansion during early erythropoiesis through the activation of cytokine receptor like signaling pathways and perhaps through direct interaction with EPOR. NmU may be useful in the clinical management of anemia in patients unresponsive to EPO or other erythroid-stimulating agents. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
