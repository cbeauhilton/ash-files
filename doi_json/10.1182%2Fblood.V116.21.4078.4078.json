It is very well documented that HGF is a cytokine that is secreted by bone marrow stromal cells which has an autocrine and paracrine role in the disease progression in a myeloma setting. HGF binds to its receptor tyrosine kinase on MM cells, MET and this binding at the extracellular domain results in activation of MET which interacts with several of its target proteins resulting in increased survival, increased proliferation, cell cycle progression, motility, migration and invasion. In normal bone marrows, co-expression of MET and its ligand HGF is a rarity whereas co-expression is a common feature of MM. Elevated levels of HGF have been observed in serum and bone marrows of MM patients with a negative correlation to disease progression. In addition, increased HGF levels cause abnormal and reduced bone formation in patients. HGF gene levels in MM samples have been observed to be significantly up regulated in myeloma cells when compared to normal cells. Recently, studies have identified that HGF facilitates the MM cells to adhere to fibronectin, a bone marrow matrix protein, thereby positively impacting MM cell invasion and proliferation. Overall, HGF and its receptor mediated pathway influences tumor progression in myeloma by targeting several different aspects of the disease biology and hence is a very attractive and potentially very important target for improving treatment regimens in a myeloma setting. Methods: MK2461 was synthesized by Merck Inc. (Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA). Stock solutions were made using DMSO and working stock solutions were made using RPMI 1640 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum (20% serum for primary patient cells) supplemented with L-Glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. MTT assay was performed to study drug induced cytotoxicity and thymidine uptake was used as a measure to study differences in proliferation. Flow cytometry using Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) was used to measure drug induced apoptosis in cell lines and patient cells. In order to study the mechanism of action of the drug, immunoblotting studies were performed on lysates made from cell lines incubated with the drug for various durations. Results: MK2461 treatment led to dose and time dependent cytotoxicity in a few myeloma cell lines (OPM2, DOX40, RPMI8226 and LR5) but not in others (MM1S, MM1R, H929 and U266). The IC50 values for the sensitive lines varied from 1\u03bc M (OPM2) to 10\u03bc M (DOX40, RPMI8226 and LR5). However, MK2461 significantly inhibited the proliferation of MM cells at sub IC50 concentrations in all cell lines tested except MM1S. This inhibition of proliferation was observed when cells were co-cultured with stromal cells or cytokines, namely VEGF, IL6 or HGF. Culturing MM cells with increasing doses of HGF was still unable to protect them from drug induced inhibition of proliferation. MK2461 was able to induce time dependent increase in apoptosis (as measured by annexin/PI), decrease in proliferation (as measured by BrdU assay) and induction of cell cycle arrest in the drug sensitive cell lines. This effect was not observed in MM1S cells. Exploring the mechanism of action of the drug indicated that MK2461 treatment led to down regulation of pc-Met, pGab1, pAkt and pErk in both the drug sensitive (OPM2) and drug resistant (MM1S) cell lines. However, proteins down stream of Akt in the PI3K/Akt pathway, namely pGSK3\u03b2, p70S6K, Bcl2, cyclin E and cyclin D3 were down regulated only in OPM2 cells. On the contrary, we observed up-regulation of these proteins in the drug resistant cell line offering a possible explanation for the drug resistant phenotype. We have also examined combinations of MK2461 with inhibitors of PI3K/Akt pathway. Conclusion: These studies demonstrate significant in-vitro activity of MK2461 in MM. Our results suggest the presence of two populations one very sensitive to MK2461 and one insensitive. Differential effects on the signaling pathways provide important clues to the mechanisms of action of c-met inhibitors in myeloma. The results form the basis for clinical evaluation of MK2461 in MM.
