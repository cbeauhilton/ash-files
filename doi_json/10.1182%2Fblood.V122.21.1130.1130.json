    "abstract_text": "Background Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious complication of heparin treatment, associated with morbidity and mortality. HIT is characterized by thrombocytopenia and thrombotic complications secondary to the formation of antibodies (Abs) against heparin-platelet-factor 4 (PF4) complexes. The pathologic mechanism involves the binding of the heparin-immune-complex to the platelet-Fc-receptor, resulting in platelet activation, aggregation, and rapid elimination. The diagnosis of HIT requires laboratory confirmation. Common laboratory testing is based on immune detection of antibodies directed against the PF4/heparin complex (ID-H/PF4-PaGIA or ELISA). However, these assays suffer from methodological limitations, especially low specificity, as compared to the platelet functional assays. The \u201cgold standard\u201d functional test for detecting of platelet-activating antibodies is the radioactive [ 14 C] serotonin-release assay ( 14 C-SRA) (Sheridan D, et al, Blood. 1986;67:27-30, Kelton JG, et al.,Blood.1988;72:925-30). However, the assay includes the use of a radiolabeled biological probe and requires considerable expertise to obtain reliable results. Consequently, its use is limited to research laboratories. Aim To overcome the methodological limitations associated with current assays, we modified a functional flow-cytometry assay (FCA), which exhibits high sensitivity and specificity (Tomer, A. Br J Haematol, 1997;98: 648-656 , Tomer, A., et al, Am J Hematol, 1999;61: 53-61). This assay, similar in concept to the 14 C-SRA, determines the capacity of the patient's serum to activate platelets in the presence of heparin, using a fluorescent probe. Methods Consecutive samples from 254 patients clinically suspected for HIT were tested. The FCA assay was compared with the standard ID-H/PF4-PaGIA antigenic assay (DiaMed, Switzerland) with two dilutions to assess specificity (Nellen, V., et al.,Haematologica, 2012;97: 89-97). Results Of the total 254 samples tested, 48 (19%) were positive by PaGIA, compared to 13 (5.1%) positive by the functional FCA ( Table 1 ). The number of PaGIA positive samples was reduced to 24 (9.4%) by 1:16 dilution, and to 14 (5.5%) by 1:32 dilution. All FCA positive samples were positive at all PaGIA dilutions (relative sensitivity 93%). Thirty PaGIA negative samples were all negative by the FCA (relative specificity 100%). Conclusion The results suggest that the functional FCA is a practical, sensitive, and highly specific test for the reliable diagnosis of HIT. Table  PaGIA 1:32 dilution . PaGIA 1:16 dilution .
