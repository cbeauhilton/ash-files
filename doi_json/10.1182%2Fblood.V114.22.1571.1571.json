    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1571 Poster Board I-596 The pseudo tyrosine kinase receptor 7 (PTK7) is an orphean tyrosine kinase receptor assigned to the planar cell polarity pathway (PCP). It has been recently described and plays a major role during embryogenesis and epithelial tissue organisation. To date there is no report in the litterature considering a potential implication in hematopoiesis. In silico and in vitro analysis found that PTK7 was also expressed in normal myeloid progenitors and CD34 + CD38 - bone marrow cells in humans. Preliminary results from our team showed that PTK7 was also expressed in various leukemic cell lines such Jurkat, TF-1 or KG-1a. We decided to perform a wide range multicolour immunophenotyping screen on patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at diagnosis and to investigate the role of PTK7 in AML in vitro . More than 250 patient samples were evaluated and we demonstrated that PTK7 was largely expressed in AML as 72% of the samples were PTK7 positive. Its expression mostly correlates with granulocytic lineage differentiation. PTK7 expression was associated with a lower WBC count at diagnosis and a lower frequency of extramedullary disease whatever was FAB subtype. Interestingly, PTK7 expression was associated with some cytogenetic subgroups including CBF-AML and APL. There was no correlation with molecular subgroups (i.e. FLT3-ITD/NPM1/CEBPA status). Overall Survival and Relapse Free Survival were evaluated in non-APL patients treated with induction chemo (n=182). Patients with PTK7 positive AML are more resistant to anthracycline-based frontline therapy with a significantly reduced Relapse Free Survival in a multivariate analysis model integrating all pre treatment variables (2 year probability of RFS= 29% vs 66% for PTK7 negative patients, p= 0.003). Forrest plot analysis showed that the negative impact of PTK7 expression was the most significant in intermediate cytogenetic risk subgroup and when PTK7 was aberrantly expressed in M4-M5 FAB subtypes. There was no demonstrated impact on CR. In cultured cells, expression of PTK7 promotes leukemia cell migration, cell survival and resistance to anthracyclin-induced apoptosis. There was no effect of PTK7 expression on cell proliferation in tritiated thymidine assay. In the absence of known inhibitor of PTK7, we produced a soluble recombinant PTK7-Fc protein that efficiently competes for PTK7 functions in cell migration and survival assays in cell lines and primary AML samples. These data were confirmed using a shRNA strategy. We conclude that PTK7 is a PCP component expressed in the myeloid progenitor compartment that conveys promigratory and anti-apoptotic signal to leukemia cells. Its use as a potential biomarker or therapeutical target should be investigated. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
