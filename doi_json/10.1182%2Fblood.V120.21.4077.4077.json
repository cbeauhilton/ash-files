    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4077 Introduction: Treatment with zoledronic acid (ZOL, 4mg) has proven effective for reducing the risk of skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients (pts) with multiple myeloma (MM), with a SRE incidence rate as low as 27% after 3.7 years' median follow-up (Morgan G, et al. Lancet Oncology 2011;12:743-52). Pts with normal bone metabolism may not require as intense a treatment schedule as pts with accelerated bone turnover. The Z-MARK study evaluated if pts with 1\u20132 years of prior intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate (BP) therapy can be treated safely long-term with less-frequent ZOL dosing based on bone turnover markers. Methods: MM pts (N=121) who started IVBP therapy (ZOL or pamidronate) 1\u20132 years before enrollment and received \u22654 prior doses, with baseline calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) of \u226530 mL/min, were enrolled. Pts received 4mg IV ZOL every (q) 4 or 12 weeks (wk) based on their most recent urinary N-telopeptide of type I collagen (uNTX) levels (q4 wk if uNTX \u226550 nmol/mmol Cr, q12 wk if uNTX <50 nmol/mmol Cr). Pts who developed a SRE or had disease progression requiring a change in MM therapy on study were treated q4 wk thereafter regardless of uNTX levels. The study's primary endpoint was the proportion of pts who experienced \u22651 SRE during study Year 1. Group A (ZOL q12 wk only, N=79) is compared with Group B (all others, N=42). Results: Of 121 pts enrolled, 52 discontinued early: 29 (36.7%) in A and 23 (54.8%) in B. Median time to discontinuation was \u223c20 months (mo) in A and \u223c24 mo in B. Median time on ZOL on study was 22.5 mo for A and 20.8 mo for B. The mean age was 63.8 years (range, 34\u201390) with approximately 1:1 male:female ratio. By International Staging System criteria, 81.0% in A and 69.1% in B were Stage I/II, while 15.2% and 19.0% were Stage III. Median time from initial MM diagnosis to enrollment was 18.4 mo in A and 18.6 mo in B. A majority of pts in both groups had \u22651 osteolytic lesions at enrollment (A, 65.8%; B, 76.2%). The median duration of prior IVBP therapy was 13.8 mo in A and 14.4 mo in B. At enrollment, 72.2% in A and 78.6% in B had \u22651 SRE. The baseline mean (standard deviation) for uNTX and calculated CrCl was 19.88 (8.8) nmol/mmol Cr, and 85.1 (31.8) mL/min in A and 24.1 (15.6) nmol/mmol Cr and 84.3 (40.0) mL/min in B. Four pts started ZOL at q4 wk vs 117 pts at q12 wk based on uNTX at study entry. Of 117 pts assigned to q12-wk dosing, 79 stayed on schedule throughout the study; 38 pts switched to q4 wk (14 for increased uNTX, 4 for SREs, and 20 for disease progression). Only 7 pts (5.8%; all in A) had a SRE in study Year 1 (3 pathologic fractures, 3 spinal cord compressions, 4 radiation to bone, 1 surgery to bone, 1 hypercalcemia of malignancy). In Year 2, only 5 pts (4.1%) had a SRE (1 pathologic fracture, 4 radiation to bone). Baseline uNTX (low: <28, high: \u226528) was predictive of SREs (hazard ratio=3.1, P =.06). Treatment was well-tolerated. The most common AEs were fatigue (26.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (24%), diarrhea (21.5%), pneumonia (21.5%), cough (20.7%), pyrexia (18.2%), arthralgia (17.4%), and nausea (17.4%); none were attributed to ZOL. Except for arthralgia, the incidence of these AEs was higher in B vs A. Serious AEs were reported in 29.1% in A and 59.5% in B. Overall, 19.8% of pts (15.2% A, 28.6% B) had an AE leading to ZOL discontinuation. At 48 wk, the median percentage change in uNTX was \u201313.3% in A and 0% in B. No change in the median serum Cr was observed in either group at 48 wk. Four deaths (2 from progression of MM, 1 from pneumonia, 1 unknown) were reported on study (not suspected to be related to ZOL). Four reports of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) were suspected to be related to ZOL (all in A, q12-wk dosing) at 22.2 mo median follow-up. Conclusions: The final Z-MARK results show that bone marker-directed dosing is feasible and safe in pts with 1\u20132 years of prior IVBP therapy. The low incidence of SREs on study shows that less-frequent IVBP dosing beyond 1\u20132 years continues to reduce the SRE risk and may reflect changing treatment patterns for MM that include therapies with bone protective effects. Baseline uNTX (\u226528 nmol/mmol Cr) trended toward significance for predicting SREs. Finally, this study, which prospectively evaluated ONJ beyond 3 years, demonstrated an incidence rate of 3.3%. Further studies and additional follow-up are needed to determine the potential predictive value and long-term benefits of bone marker-directed ZOL dosing in MM pts after standard IVBP treatment.
