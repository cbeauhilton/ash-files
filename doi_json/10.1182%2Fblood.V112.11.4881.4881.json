    "abstract_text": "Objective : Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGF-R1 and R2) are major regulators of angiogenesis, which plays a key role in the growth and dissemination of solid tumors and hematological neoplasms. Materials and methods : To assess serum levels of VEGF and VEGF-R1 and their prognostic significance in newly diagnosed childhood acute leukemia, we used an Enzyme linked Immuno-Sorbant Assay (ELISA) to quantify their levels in stored samples obtained before treatment. Demographic data were recorded. Bone marrow blast percentage was counted at day of diagnosis and 2 weeks after induction therapy. The data entered and analyzed with SPSS11 software. P value under 0.05 assumed significant. Results : Fifty-three children (22boys and 31girls) with newly diagnosed ALL with median age of 6.4\u00b13.72 years were enrolled into the study. Most cases (56.6%) were pre B cell ALL. Mean value of VEFG-A in good responders was 55.13\u00b124.96 pg/ml and in poor responders was 94.46\u00b115.75 (P0.05). By using ROC curve, we found cut off point 76 pg/ml with sensitivity 99 % and specificity 81 % to discriminate poor response to chemotherapy. Conclusion : Soluble VEGF-A is an independent factor of response to therapy in childhood leukemia and leukemic patients with sVEGF-A level over 76pg/ml, will have poor response to treatment.",
