    "abstract_text": "Background: The development of B-lymphocyte is controlled by the coordinated action of transcription factors networks, such as IKZF1 , TCF3 , EBF1 or PAX5 . It is increasingly recognized that germline variants of those genes which disrupt their function are responsible for inborn errors of humoral immunity. Meanwhile, it is well understood genetic alterations of those molecules are frequently altered in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and are associated with leukemogenesis. However, those involvements are usually attributed to somatic mutation. Germline variations may also trigger cancer development in some cases. For instance, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified B-cell precursor (BCP-) ALL susceptibility variants within IKZF1 . Furthermore, germline variants of IKZF1 , TCF3 , and PAX5 are reported to be associated with B-ALL development. Therefore, we hypothesize that attenuated function due to germline variation in those genes may predispose to ALL development in Japanese population to some extent. Method: Saliva DNA from 583 pediatric ALL patients in remission registered in Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group (TCCSG) were analyzed in this study. Targeted sequencing for exons and exon-intron boundaries of IKZF1 , TCF3 , and PAX5 was performed using next-generation sequencer. Frequency of the detected variant alleles was compared to data from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) East Asian Cohort (n=4327), Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization (ToMMo) cohort (n=3554), and the Human Genetic Variation Database (HGVD) cohort (n=1208) by chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Results: In total, 113 variants (28 nonsynonymous, 19 synonymous, 56 intronic, 8 untranslated regions, and 2 deletions) were detected. We could not detect any nonsynonymous variations, insertion or deletion in IKZF1 . On the other hand, we detected 8 rare variations in TCF3 and 7 of them are found to be deleterious by in silico analysis. Among them, 1 variant, TCF3 p.S514L, was significantly more common in ALL patients (0.26% in patients vs 0% in ExAC, 0.01% in ToMMO and 0% in HGVD, p=0.0017, 0.0115 and 0.0343 respectively). In PAX5 , we found 6 rare variations and 3 of them are found to be deleterious by in silico analysis, However, we could not identify a statistically significant difference in frequency among these variants between TCCSG and normal cohorts. On the other hand, a patient who harbored heterozygous PAX5 p.V26G, which had been reported as a somatic mutation in B-ALL, was diagnosed with primary antibody deficiency after treatment of B-ALL. He is receiving immunoglobulin replacement therapy without relapse of ALL for 15 years. Discussion: Our study implied TCF3 p.S514L is associated with ALL development. Besides, we identified a case of heterozygous PAX5 p.V26G variant who exhibited antibody deficiency and B-ALL. These findings suggest those rare variants impair the normal B-cell development and may predispose to ALL development. GWAS is effective in evaluating common genetic variants. However, it is hard to identify the genes involved Mendelian inheritance or functionally defective rare variants associated with disease susceptibility. Although it is rare, our study suggests that rare variants of genes involved in B cell development could be associated with ALL susceptibility and immunodeficiency, and we revealed the frequency of functionally defective rare variants in Japanese childhood ALL cohort.
