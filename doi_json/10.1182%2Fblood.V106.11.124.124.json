    "abstract_text": "The family of core binding factors includes the DNA-binding subunits Runx1-3 and the common non-DNA binding partner CBF\u03b2. Runx1 and CBF\u03b2 are essential for the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells during fetal development, but not for stem cell maintenance during later ontogeny. Runx1 is also required for megakaryocyte differentiation, B cell development, and for the DN2 to DN3 transition in thymocyte development. Runx2/CBF\u03b2 are critical for normal osteogenesis, and Runx3 for CD4 silencing in CD8 + T cells, but their contribution to other steps of hematopoietic development is unknown. To examine the collective role of core binding factors in hematopoiesis, we generated a hypomorphic Cbfb allele ( Cbfb rss ). CBF\u03b2 protein levels were reduced by approximately 2\u20133 fold in fetuses homozygous for the Cbfb rss allele ( Cbfb rss/rss ), and 3\u20134 fold in fetuses carrying one hypomorphic and one knockout allele ( Cbfb rss/\u2212 ). Cbfb rss/rss and Cbfb rss/\u2212 fetuses had normal erythroid and B cell development, and relatively mild abnormalities in megakaryocyte and granulocyte differentiation. In contrast, T cell development was very sensitive to an incremental reduction of CBF\u03b2 levels: mature thymocytes were decreased in Cbfb rss/rss fetuses, and virtually absent in Cbfb rss/\u2212 fetuses. We next assessed the development of Cbfb rss/rss and Cbfb rss/\u2212 fetal liver progenitors after transplantation to irradiated adult recipients, in competition with wild-type ( wt ) bone marrow cells. Wt , Cbfb rss/rss and Cbfb rss/\u2212 fetal progenitors replenished the erythroid, myeloid and B cell compartments equally well. The overall development of Cbfb rss/rss T cells was preserved, although CD4 expression was derepressed in double negative thymocytes. In Cbfb rss/\u2212 chimeras, mature thymocytes were entirely derived from competitor cells. Furthermore, the developmental block in Cbfb rss/\u2212 progenitors was present at the earliest stages of T cell development within the DN1 (ETP) and DN2 subsets. Our data define a critical CBF\u03b2 threshold for normal T cell development, and they situate an essential role of core binding factors during the earliest stages of T cell development. In addition, early thymopoiesis appeared more severely affected by reduced CBF\u03b2 dosage than by the lack of Runx1 (Ichikawa et al. , Nat Med 2004; Growney et al. , Blood 2005), suggesting that Runx2/3 may contribute to core binding factor activity in the T cell lineage.",
