    "abstract_text": "Background: Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is characterized by the presence of CD30-positive Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells. The standard of care for patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory (R/R) HL is salvage chemotherapy followed by high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (auto-SCT). Approximately 50% of these pts will experience relapse or progression of HL after auto-SCT. For these individuals, outcomes have historically been poor, with median overall survival (OS) from time of relapse ranging from 10.5 to 27.6 mos (Crump, 2008; Fanale, 2013). A pivotal phase 2 study evaluated brentuximab vedotin, a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate, in pts with R/R HL after auto-SCT (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT00848926). Primary results and 3-year follow-up data have been previously reported (Younes, 2012; Gopal, 2015). Here, we summarize final data from the 5-year follow-up period. Methods: Pts received 1.8 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin once every 3 wks as a 30-min outpatient IV infusion for up to 16 cycles. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) per independent review according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2007). Assessments of response and durability of response per an independent review facility (IRF) have been previously reported. Following a protocol amendment that removed the requirement for routine CT scanning during the follow-up period, disease status was only assessed per the investigator. Survival and disease status were assessed every 3 mos for 2 yrs and then every 6 mos through Year 5. CT scans were required if progression was suspected clinically. At the time of the amendment, 18 patients were still being assessed for progression; these patients had been in long-term follow-up for a median of over 30 months. Results: The enrolled population of 102 pts (53% female) was heavily pretreated and had a median age of 31 yrs (range, 15-77 yrs). Pts received a median of 9 cycles (range, 1-16) of brentuximab vedotin. Per investigator, the ORR to brentuximab vedotin was 72% and complete remission (CR) rate was 33%. The most common treatment-related adverse events were peripheral sensory neuropathy, nausea, fatigue, neutropenia, and diarrhea. Adverse events of Grade 3 or higher that occurred in \u22655% of pts were neutropenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. At study closure, which occurred approximately 5 yrs after the last patient's end-of-treatment visit, the median observation time for all enrolled patients from first dose was 35.1 mos (range, 1.8 to 72.9). The estimated 5-year overall survival rate was 41% (95% CI: 31 %, 51%) and the median OS was 40.5 mos (95% CI: 28.7, 61.9 [range, 1.8 to 72.9+]). Median OS by best clinical response was CR (n=34): median not reached; partial remission (PR, n=39): 39.4 mos; and stable disease (SD, n=28): 18.3 mos. The median PFS was 9.3 months overall, but was not reached in CR pts. Of the 102 enrolled patients, 15 remained in follow-up and in remission at study closure. Among these 15 pts, 6 received consolidative allo-SCT and 9 have received no further therapy since completing brentuximab vedotin. Conclusions: These end-of-study results demonstrate that single agent brentuximab vedotin can induce durable remissions and long-term survival in a subset of heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory HL, particularly in pts that achieve CR. A randomized phase 3 study is being conducted to evaluate brentuximab vedotin in combination with AVD (doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) versus ABVD (A, bleomycin, VD) for frontline treatment of advanced HL (ECHELON-1 trial, ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT01712490).
