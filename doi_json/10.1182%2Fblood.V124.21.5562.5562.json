    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Several mutations have been described in patients with BCR-ABL1 \u2013 negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, including primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The most frequent mutation is JAK2 V617F, followed by calreticulin exon 9 ( CALR ), MPL exon 10 and ASXL1 exon 12. Currently, less than 10% of patients lack molecular marker. CALR and ASXL1 mutations have been consistently found to have favorable and unfavorable prognostic implications, respectively. The aim of this study was to describe the frequency and prognostic impact of JAK2 V617F, CALR , MPL and ASXL1 mutations in patients diagnosed with PMF in 6 Spanish hospitals. METHODS: To detect the presence of JAK2 V617F mutation, an allele-specific PCR using TaqMan probes was used. Screening for insertions and deletions in CALR gene was performed with 6-FAM labeled primers spanning exon 9 and CALR mutations were described by Sanger sequencing. Sanger sequencing was also used to detect MPL exon 10 and ASXL1 exon 12 mutations. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were included in the study. All of them were screened for JAK2 and CALR mutations. Forty-five of them (66%) were positive for the JAK2 V617F mutation, while 11/68 (16%) were positive for CALR mutations. Of the 11 CALR mutations, 10 were JAK2 wild-type. MPL exon 10 mutation analysis was only performed in JAK2 wild-type patients and was positive in 4/23 patients (17%), and all of them were CALR wild-type. At the time of submission, ASXL1 exon 12 has been assessed in 18 patients (analysis in the rest of them is currently ongoing). ASXL1 mutations have been found in 3/18 (17%) patients, two of them also with a CALR mutation and the other one with the JAK2 V617F mutation. All three cases were indel mutations. Overall, no mutation was detected in 9/68 (13%) patients. JAK2 V617F, CALR and MPL mutations had no prognostic impact on overall survival. The effect of ASXL1 mutation on prognosis (with and without CALR mutation) will be assessed once all samples have been sequenced. CONCLUSION: JAK2 V617F, CALR and MPL mutations were found in our series of PMF patients in the same proportion found in larger series. ASXL1 has so far been found in a smaller percentage but the entire series of patients will need to be sequenced before reaching definitive conclusions. Studying these genes, only 13% of patients with PMF did not have a clonal marker. None of the studied mutations had prognostic significance.
