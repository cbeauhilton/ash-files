    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The combination of a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi; parenteral azacitidine or decitabine) with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax is a newly established standard-of-care regimen for patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) ineligible to receive intensive induction chemotherapy (DiNardo et al, 2020). Replacing the parenteral DNMTi with an oral DNMTi with equivalent exposure may provide the benefit of reducing patient and caregiver burden of chronic parenteral therapy, and may help responding patients stay on treatment longer. ASTX727 (a fixed-dose combination of decitabine 35 mg and cedazuridine 100 mg) is an oral DNMTi that provides equivalent exposure to its parenteral DNMTi at standard dosing (Savona et al, 2020) and is under evaluation in combination with venetoclax as an all-oral regimen. Methods: This is an ongoing Phase 1 study being conducted at 7 US medical centers (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04657081). Newly diagnosed AML patients 75 years or older, or with comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy are eligible. The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of ASTX727 on the PK of venetoclax. Key secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of venetoclax on the PK of ASTX727, and to determine the safety and efficacy profile for the combination. For Cycle 2 and beyond, ASTX727 is administered orally daily on days 1-5 and venetoclax 400 mg is administered orally daily on days 1-28 of 28-day cycles. For Cycle 1, ASTX727 is given in the same dose schedule while venetoclax is given as a ramp-up on days 1 and 2 according to the venetoclax US prescribing information (USPI); therefore, the PK studies are conducted during Cycle 2. Delay of subsequent cycles and venetoclax dose modifications for hematologic toxicities and anti-fungal concomitant medications follow the venetoclax USPI. Response assessments are evaluated using the 2017 ELN criteria (D\u00f6hner et al, 2017) and the CRh criterion (complete response [CR] with partial hematologic recovery) defined as those patients achieving marrow CR criteria but not peripheral blood count criteria and demonstrating an absolute neutrophil count >500/\u03bcL and platelet >50,000/\u03bcL (Kantarjian et al, 2017). Results: At the data cut-off date of August 1, 2021, 15 AML patients have enrolled and received study treatment. Median age is 78 years (range 66 - 84) and 9 (60%) are males. Of the 12 patients with data, 2 (17%), 6 (50%), and 4 (33%) patients are in the favorable, intermediate, and adverse risk ELN categories, respectively. Of the 15 dosed patients, 6 (40%) are diagnosed with AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. The median duration of exposure is 2 cycles (range 1-5) and 1.7 months (range 0.8-5.6). The most common adverse events (AEs) of Grade 2 or higher occurring in \u226510% of patients include neutropenia (5, 33%), febrile neutropenia (2, 13%), anemia (2, 13%), thrombocytopenia (2, 13%), vomiting (2, 13%), pneumonia (2, 13%), peripheral edema (2, 13%), hypertension (2, 13%) and vascular access complication (2, 13%). There are 17 serious AEs experienced in 7 patients; a grade 3 pneumonia and a grade 3 dysphagia are the only serious AEs assessed as related to ASTX727 and/or venetoclax and both events occurred in the same patient. Both AEs were part of the patient's medical history. Two deaths have occurred to date: one patient due to rapidly progressive disease during Cycle 2 and one patient who achieved a best response of CRh transitioned to hospice due to progressive multiple myeloma. Of 9 patients with response assessments and evaluable data, 3 (33%) achieved CR and 4 (44%) achieved CRh as the best response for a composite CR+CRh rate of 78%. Preliminary PK data available from 9 patients show venetoclax exposures are not affected by coadministration of ASTX727and are similar to historical data. Exposures of decitabine and cedazuridine are consistent with the range seen in previous studies. Updated PK, safety, and efficacy data will be provided in December 2021. Conclusions: A preliminary analysis of ASTX727 and venetoclax combination therapy in patients with newly diagnosed AML unfit for intensive induction chemotherapy demonstrate expected PK data, and a similar safety and efficacy profile to the approved combination therapy of a DNMTi and venetoclax. These preliminary data suggest that an all-oral regimen of a DNMTi in combination with venetoclax is feasible and should be investigated further.
