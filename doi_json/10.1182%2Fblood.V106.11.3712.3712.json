    "abstract_text": "There are few reports of transferrin saturation (TfSat) and serum ferritin (SF) phenotypes and HFE C282Y and H63D genotypes in native Americans. We compared initial screening data of 645 native American and 43,453 white HEIRS Study participants who reported a single race/ethnicity and who did not report a previous diagnosis of hemochromatosis or iron overload. Each underwent TfSat and SF measurements without regard to fasting, and HFE C282Y and H63D genotyping. Elevated measurements were defined as: TfSat >50% (men), >45% (women); and SF >300 ng/mL (men), >200 ng/mL (women). Mean TfSat was lower in native American men than in white men (31% vs. 32%, respectively; p = 0.0337), and lower in native American women than in white women (25% vs. 27%, respectively; p <0.0001). Mean SF was similar in native American and white men (153 \u03bcg/L vs. 151 \u03bcg/L; p = 0.8256); mean SF was lower in native American women than in white women (55 \u03bcg/L vs. 63 \u03bcg/L, respectively; p = 0.0015). The respective percentages of native American men and women with elevated TfSat or elevated SF were similar to those of white men and women. The respective mean TfSat and SF values of native American and white participants with genotype HFE wt/wt were similar. The C282Y allele frequency was 0.0340 in native Americans and 0.0683 in whites (p <0.0001). The H63D allele frequency was 0.1150 in native Americans and 0.1532 in whites (p = 0.0001). We conclude that the screening TfSat and SF phenotypes of native Americans do not differ greatly from those of whites. The respective allele frequencies of HFE C282Y and H63D are significantly lower in native Americans than in whites.",
