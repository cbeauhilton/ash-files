    "abstract_text": "Background: KRT-232 is a potent, selective, orally available, targeted inhibitor of human MDM2 homolog interactions with tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53). KRT-232 is under development for treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms, acute myeloid leukemia and Merkel cell carcinoma. KRT-232 is a highly permeable 568.6 g/mol, monoprotic carboxylic acid (pKa 4.35); elimination involves primarily biliary-fecal excretion of an acyl glucuronide metabolite (M1) and enteric glucuronide hydrolysis with enterohepatic recirculation of parent drug. M1 is a 744.7 g/mol monoprotic acid with pKa 3.32 and 1/5 th the MDM2 inhibitory potency of KRT-232. Plasma protein binding ( f up ) of KRT-232 and M1 were ~0.026 and ~0.006, respectively. Static model drug-drug interaction (DDI) calculations (FDA-CDER. 2020) indicated a potential minor DDI with substrates of cytochrome P450s (CYP) CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, UGT1A1, P-glycoprotein 1 (P-gp) and OATP1B1/3. Here, a 'fit-for-purpose' PBPK model for KRT-232 was developed using physicochemical, preclinical ( in vitro and in vivo ) and clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) data (Kartos Data on file ; Ye et al. Xenobiotica . 2015; Gluck et al. Invest New Drugs . 2020 [Study A]). Methods: Simcyp Simulator V17 (release 1; 27/11/2017; 17.0.90.0) was used. In vitro kinetic parameters: In vitro K i for competitive inhibition of CYP2C8 was 3.8 and 0.17 \u00b5M for KRT-232 and M1, respectively. In vitro K I and k inact for mechanism-based inhibition of CYP3A4 by KRT-232 were 28 \u00b5M and 4.14 h -1 , respectively. Estimated in vitro K i values for KRT-232-mediated inhibition of UGT1A1, P-gp, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, were 1.9, 14.8, 4.9 and 6.9 \u00b5M. For M1-mediated inhibition of UGT1A1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, values were 2.3, 0.393 and 0.606 \u00b5M. Model development and verification: KRT-232 absorption was described by a first-order process; fraction absorbed was assumed to be 100% and the absorption rate constant was manually optimized using observed mean plasma concentration data from Part 1 of Study A. KRT-232 clearance was based on in vitro formation clearance of M1 in human liver microsomes, scaled up 4-fold based on observed oral clearance of KRT-232 (Wood et al. Drug Metab Dispos . 2017). KRT-232 distribution volume was described by a minimal PBPK model. KRT-232 and M1 DDI parameters were based on in vitro data. M1 clearance was manually optimized using mean observed data from Study A (Part 1, 240 mg dose), and distribution volume was predicted by the Simulator using Method 1 and a full PBPK model. PBPK simulated data were compared with patient PK data collected during Part 2 of Study A. Model application: The model predicted potential DDI after steady state (SS) 240 mg once daily KRT-232 administration with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, UGT1A1, P-gp and OATP1B1/3. DDI simulations included 100 virtual subjects assigned to 10 virtual trials (N=10 each). Population estimates of geometric mean and median C max and AUC 0-\u221e ratios were generated. A \"worst case\" sensitivity analysis was performed by using a 10-fold increase in in vitro CYP3A4 interaction potency (K I , EC 50 ) relative to the measured in vitro value. Results : Figure 1 shows simulated SS mean and individual observed KRT-232 and M1 concentration data from Part 2 of Study A. SS KRT-232 C max , AUC 0-24h and t 1/2 were predicted within 0.80-1.25-fold of observed PK data and t max was under-predicted (0.36-fold) by the model ( Table 1 ). M1 C max and AUC 0-24h were within 0.80-1.25-fold of observed PK data on Day 1 (not shown). M1 C max on Day 7 was within 0.80-1.25-fold of observed PK data and SS AUC 0-24h, t 1/2, and t max were underpredicted (0.72, 0.79 and 0.61-fold) relative to observed PK data. In all simulated DDIs, no clinically significant interaction was predicted for SS 240 mg doses of KRT-232 since predicted C max and AUC 0-\u221e geometric mean ratio (GMR) changes were less than 1.25-fold ( Table 2 ). The CYP3A4 DDI simulation gave a population GMR (90% CI) for C max and AUC 0-\u221e of 1.07 (1.06, 1.09) and 1.15 (1.12, 1.17), respectively. In a sensitivity check, predicted midazolam C max and AUC 0-\u221e after a 10-fold reduction of in vitro K I and EC 50 were 1.44-fold and 2.18-fold, respectively. Although unlikely, a weak CYP3A4 DDI could not be definitively excluded. Conclusions: Mean plasma exposure of KRT-232 and M1 and inter-individual variability were adequately described by the PBPK model. No clinically significant DDI were predicted based on C max and AUC 0-\u221e GMR changes of less than 1.25-fold.
