    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4325 Objective Retrospective analysis the therapeutic and side effect of the rabbit antithymocyte (ATG) versus swine ALG within the preparative regimen of allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation (allo-HSCT) for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Methods Totally 102 patients who had admitted to our hospital and been treated by allo-HSCT with the preparative regimen including ATG/ALG were followed up from June 2002 to June 2008. They were divided into ATG group and ALG group. The allergic reaction, effect of GVHD prophylaxis, transplantation related mortality (TRM), disease free survival (DFS) and relapse rate (RR) of these groups were retrospectively analyzed. Cumulative rate were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and the factors associated with the III?\u2018\u2021W AGVHD were analyzed with the COX regression model. Results ALG group had more allergic reaction than ATG, but ATG group had more bacteremia and cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenaemia. The haematopoiesis reconstitution was comparable in two groups. The III?\u2018\u2021W AGVHD, two-year TRM,DFS and RR were (40% vs 21%, p =0.028),(54% vs 29%, p =0.039),(41% vs 53%, p =0.174),(10% vs 24%, p =0.306),respectively in ATG/ALG groups. In multivariate analysis,10mg/kg ATG as a protective variable to III?\u2018\u2021W AGVHD occurrence( RR =0.53 ;95%CI, 0.38?\u20180.71),The CD3 + cell counts of administration was associated with an increased risk for III?\u2018\u2021W GVHD( RR =4.43 ;95%CI, 3.87?\u20184.95). Conclusion 10mg/kg ATG significantly decreased the risks for III?\u2018\u2021W AGVHD and extensive chronic GVHD(ecGVHD); The lethal infections became the most important cause of death in the ATG group, but the increased risk for infection did not neutralize the reduction of TRM induced by the decrease of severe GVHD.
