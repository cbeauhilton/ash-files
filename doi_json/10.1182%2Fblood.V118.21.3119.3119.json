    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3119 BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects approximately 80, 000 Americans, and causes significant neurologic, pulmonary, and renal injury, as well as severe acute and chronic pain that adversely impacts quality of life. Because SCD results from abnormalities in red blood cells, which in turn are produced from adult hematopoietic stem cells, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) from a healthy (allogeneic) donor can benefit patients with SCD, by providing a source for life-long production of normal red blood cells. However, allogeneic HSCT is limited by the availability of well-matched donors and by immunological complications of graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease. Thus, despite major improvements in clinical care, SCD continues to cause significant morbidity and early mortality. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that autologous stem cell gene therapy for SCD has the potential to treat this illness without the need for immune suppression of current allogeneic HSCT approaches. Previous studies have demonstrated that addition of a \u03b2-globin gene, modified to have the anti-sickling properties of fetal (\u03b3-) globin (\u03b2AS3), to bone marrow (BM) stem cells in murine models of SCD normalizes RBC physiology and prevents the manifestations of sickle cell disease (Levassuer Blood 102 :4312\u20139, 2003). The present work seeks to provide pre-clinical evidence of efficacy for SCD gene therapy using human BM CD34+ cells modified with the bAS3 lentiviral (LV) vector. RESULTS: The \u03b2AS3 globin expression cassette was inserted into the pCCL LV vector backbone to confer tat-independence for packaging. The FB (FII/BEAD-A) composite enhancer-blocking insulator was inserted into the 3' LTR (Ramezani, Stem Cells 26 :32\u2013766, 2008). Assessments were performed transducing human BM CD34+ cells from healthy or SCD donors with \u03b2AS3 LV vectors. Efficient (1\u20133 vector copies/cell) and stable gene transmission were determined by qPCR and Southern Blot. CFU assays demonstrated that \u03b2AS3 gene modified SCD CD34+ cells are fully capable of maintaining their hematopoietic potential. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the erythroid-specific bAS3 gene in the context of human HSPC (Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells), we optimized an in vitro model of erythroid differentiation of huBM CD34+ cells. We successfully obtained an expansion up to 700 fold with >80% fully mature enucleated RBC derived from CD34+ cells obtained from healthy or SCD BM donors. We then assessed the expression of the \u03b2AS3 globin gene by isoelectric focusing: an average of 18% HbAS3 over the total globin present (HbS, HbA2) per Vector Copy Number (VCN) was detected in RBC derived from SCD BM CD34+. A qRT-PCR assay able to discriminate HbAS3 vs. HbA RNA, was also established, confirming the quantitative expression results obtained by isoelectric focusing. Finally, we show morphologic correction of in vitro differentiated RBC obtained from SCD BM CD34+ cells after \u03b2AS3 LV transduction; upon induction of deoxygenation, cells derived from SCD patients showed the typical sickle shape whereas significantly reduced numbers were detected in \u03b2AS3 gene modified cells. Studies to investigate risks of insertional oncogenesis from gene modification of CD34+ cells by \u03b2AS3 LV vectors are ongoing as are in vivo studies to demonstrate the efficacy of \u03b2AS3 LV vector in the NSG mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides initial evidence for the efficacy of the modification of human SCD BM CD34+ cells with \u03b2AS3 LV vector for gene therapy of sickle cell disease.
