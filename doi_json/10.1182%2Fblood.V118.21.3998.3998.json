    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3998 Leukemia and other cancers possess self-renewing stem cells that help maintain cancer. Chromosomal translocations are often involved in the development of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The monocytic leukemia zinc finger ( MOZ ) gene is one of the targets of such translocations. While MOZ is essential for the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells, the leukemia associated MOZ-fusion proteins enable the transformation of non\u2013self-renewing myeloid progenitors into leukemia stem cells. Ring1A and Ring1B are catalytic subunits of the polycomb-group repressive complex 1 (PRC1) complex containing Bmi1, and PRC1 complex plays an important role in the regulation of stem cell self-renewal. Using Ring1A-null and Ring1B-conditional deficient mice, we showed that Ring1A/B are required for continuous colony forming ability that is enabled by MOZ-TIF2 and other AML-associated fusions such as MLL-AF10, AML1-ETO, and PML-RAR\u03b1. Furthermore, MOZ-TIF2- and MLL-AF10-induced AML development in mice were prevented by Ring 1A/B deficiency. To clarify the mechanism of stemness regulation in AML stem cells by PRC1 complex, we compared gene expression profiles of Ring1A/B deleted and non-deleted MOZ-TIF2-induced AML cells. As expected, Ink4a/Arf, a known major target of PRC1 complex involved in stem cell functions, was derepressed by deletion of Ring1A/B. Although deletion of Ink4a/Arf in Ring1A/B deficient AML cells partially restored colony formation ability, it was not substantial to initiate leukemia in recipient mice. Among several target genes which were derepressed by deletion of Ring1A/B, we focused on \u201cStemness inhibitory factor (SIF)\u201d, known to be required for cell differentiation and morphogenesis in some specific organs. Enforced expression of SIF in MOZ-TIF2-induced AML cells stimulated differentiation of AML progenitors into macrophages. On the other hand, knock-down of SIF blocked cell differentiation block and restored the immortalizing ability of MOZ-TIF2-induced AML progenitors, despite of the absence of Ring1A/B. Collectively, our data demonstrate that Ring 1A/B play crucial roles in the maintenance of AML stem cells through repression of SIF, which strongly promote differentiation of leukemia stem cells.
