    "abstract_text": "Background DCDS4501A (DCDS), an anti-CD79b monoclonal antibody (Ab), is conjugated to the anti-mitotic agent MMAE. We previously determined a recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of 2.4 mg/kg every 21 days (q21d), and clinical activity in R/R B-cell NHL at doses \u2265 1.8 mg/kg (Palanca-Wessels et al. ASH 2012). Here we update results from patients (pts) treated at 1.8 mg/kg and from the 2.4 mg/kg expansion cohort. Methods We evaluated ongoing safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and activity of DCDS with or without rituximab (RTX) at 375 mg/m 2 q21d in pts with R/R DLBCL and indolent (i)NHL. Results Sixty pts were treated with DCDS (6 at 1.8 mg/kg, 45 at 2.4 mg/kg) and DCDS+RTX (9, DCDS at 2.4 mg/kg). Median age 68 yrs (range 20-86); 82% ECOG PS100-fold lower than acMMAE with an average Cycle 1 value of 5-9 ng/mL at the 2.4 mg/kg ADC dose level. Moderate accumulation of acMMAE and total Ab on the q21d dosing schedule was observed with no accumulation of free MMAE. Overall objective responses were observed in 27/51 (53%) DCDS and 7/9 (78%) DCDS+RTX pts. Objective (OR) and complete responses (CR) by histology were as follows:  . DCDS . DCDS + RTX . . OR . CR . OR . CR . R/R DLBCL 15/31 (48%) 3/31 (10%) 1/1 0 R/R iNHL 7/15 (47%) 3/15 (20%) 5/5 (100%) 2/5 (40%) . DCDS . DCDS + RTX . . OR . CR . OR . CR . R/R DLBCL 15/31 (48%) 3/31 (10%) 1/1 0 R/R iNHL 7/15 (47%) 3/15 (20%) 5/5 (100%) 2/5 (40%) View Large The median PFS for DLBCL patients treated with DCDS or DCDS + RTX was 149 days. The median PFS for iNHL patients treated with DCDS or DCDS + RTX was 241 days. Conclusions DCDS and DCDS+RTX were generally well-tolerated. Neutropenia and PN were the principal toxicities. PN was reversible in some patients with dose delays and reductions. Encouraging anti-tumor activity was observed in heavily pretreated pts with R/R NHL. Updated results from this Phase I study will be presented. An ongoing randomized Phase II study of DCDS+RTX versus a CD22-directed ADC (DCDT2980S) with the same linker-cytotoxic agent in patients with R/R DLBCL and follicular lymphoma will further assess the efficacy of DCDS in the treatment of NHL. Additional studies of DCDS combined with immunochemotherapy are being planned. Disclosures: Palanca-Wessels: Genentech, inc.: Research Funding.
