    "abstract_text": "Two death receptors, TRAIL-R1 (DR4) and TRAIL-R2 (DR5), expressed in a wide variety of cancer cell types including lymphoma, enable TRAIL (TNF related apoptosis inducing ligand), a member of the TNF ligand superfamily, to induce apoptosis. HGS-ETR1 (TRM-1, mapatumumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody agonistic to TRAIL-R1 with preclinical evidence of anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo . We conducted a phase 2 multicenter study of HGS-ETR1 in 40 subjects with relapsed or refractory NHL. Patients were included on the study if they had relapsed/refractory NHL of any histologic subtype, irrespective of the number of previous treatment regimens. HGS-ETR1 was administered at 2 dose levels: 3 mg/kg (8 subjects) or 10 mg/kg (32 subjects) every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or prohibitive toxicity for up to 6 cycles. The primary endpoint was tumor response evaluated with the International Working Group Criteria after every third treatment. Responses were confirmed between 4 and 8 weeks after initial documentation of response. Secondary endpoints included safety and tolerability. The median age of subjects was 62 years (range 32\u201381) (24M:16F) with an ECOG performance status 0\u20132. Subjects had received up to 12 previous therapeutic regimens (69% received 3 or more prior regimens). Original histologic classification is presently available for 34 subjects (14 follicular, 7 diffuse large B-cell, 6 mantle cell, 1 small lymphocytic, 2 peripheral T-cell, 1 anaplastic large cell, 3 lymphomas not classified). Preliminary response data are available for all 40 subjects. 3 subjects (8%), all with follicular lymphoma, had clinical responses (1CR, 2PR). Additionally, 12/40 subjects (30%) had stable disease, and the remainder had progressive disease at the time of first evaluation. 8 subjects (7 follicular) remain on study without disease progression for >5 to >13 months. One subject with a PR (special permission) has continued to receive HGS-ETR1 (10 cycles to date). Subjects tolerated therapy well with no subjects discontinuing therapy due to toxicity related to drug. There have been 10 reported SAEs, 2 of which were considered possibly/probably related to HGS-ETR1 administration (shingles, fever). In conclusion, HGS-ETR1 can be safely administered to heavily treated NHL patients. Clinical responses were seen in 3/14 follicular lymphoma subjects to date. Final data for all subjects will be reported at the meeting. These data suggest that HGS-ETR1 has activity in heavily pretreated lymphoma patients and further studies in combination with agents active in lymphoma are justified.",
