    "abstract_text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are one of the fastest growing therapeutics in the drug sector. For many antibodies, the structure and extent of the N-glycans on the Fc region of the H-chain plays a significant role in their therapeutic function. A glyco-optimized anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab) was expressed in the clonal aquatic plant Lemna . The optimized glycosylation was accomplished by co-expressing an interfering RNA (RNAi) construct targeting the endogenous alpha-1,3-fucoslytransferase (FucT) and beta-1,2-xylosyltransferase (XylT) genes ( Cox et al ., 2006 ). The resulting glyco-optimized rituximab contained a single major G0 N-glycan without any detectable xylose or fucose. In cell-based functional assays, the glyco-optimized rituximab showed similar CD20-binding affinity and apoptotic effects as Rituxan\u00ae produced in mammalian cells but with significantly enhanced (up to 100-fold) antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Using FACS based methods, comparable CD20-binding was demonstrated in the B-cell lines Raji, Daudi and Wil2S. Apoptotic measurements used Raji and Daudi cells. In the treatment of non-Hodgkin\u2019s B-cell lymphoma (NHL), the patient response rate for Rituxan is only 50\u201360% and is significantly correlated with a FcgRIIIa receptor polymorphism ( Cartron et al ., 2002 ). However, the glyco-optimized rituximab showed enhanced ADCC with effector cells from all FcgRIIIa-158 genotypes. ADCC activity was determined by FACS-based methods using Raji as the target cells. PBMC genotyping was accomplished by PCR analysis ( Koene et al ., 1997 ). Up to a ten-fold decrease in complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) was also observed using Raji cells. This functional profile may offer the potential for an optimized anti-CD20 antibody therapeutic with improved efficacy and potency while simultaneously decreasing the side effects associated with CDC activity ( Clark and Ledbetter, 2005 ).",
