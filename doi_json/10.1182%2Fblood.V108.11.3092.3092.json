    "abstract_text": "Background: Patients with AL and congestive heart failure have a median survival of less than one year. Methods: Between 1994 and 2005, 11 patients underwent sequential heart transplant followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (SCT) for treatment of AL. Patients had heart dominant AL with minimal/no other organ impairment and no evidence of multiple myeloma. Results: Patients ranged in age from 35 to 63 years (median 54). All had biopsy proven amyloidosis and monoclonal protein detectable in serum (73%) or urine (100%). Free light chain assay was available prior to SCT in 6 and was abnormal in all. All patients presented with NYHA Class III or IV heart failure. All but two patients had no other organ involved at the time of heart transplant. One patient had his heart transplant at another facility and had renal involvement at the time of heart transplant. One patient had peripheral nerve involvement documented prior to heart transplant. Five patients had progression of amyloid to involve other organs by the time of SCT. These included: renal (6), peripheral nerve (2), macroglossia (3), gastrointestinal (2). The median time from diagnosis to heart transplant was 3 months (range 1 to 5). The median time from heart transplant to SCT was 8 months, (range 3 to 24). Conditioning chemotherapy consisted of melphalan 200 mg /m2 (6 patients) or melphalan 140 mg/m2 (5 patients). Two patients died of complications before day +100, (TRM of 18%). Hematologic remissions were seen in 8 and organ responses in 3. Five were unable to be evaluated for organ response due to the heart transplant. Three died from progressive amyloidosis at 66, 56.7, and 55 months following SCT. The median survival is 56.7 months from SCT. Six are alive with a median follow-up of 24 months, range 9 to 90 months. Among the 6 surviving patients, one patient relapsed and one patient has failed to improve, but 4 patients are in continued remission. One patient developed secondary myelodysplastic syndrome. Conclusions: Heart transplant followed by SCT is feasible and offers durable remissions for carefully selected patients with cardiac AL.
