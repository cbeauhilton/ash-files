    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4160 We propose that the pathophysiology of marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MZL) could allow for their classification into lymphoid organs located in MZL and extra-nodal MZL of MALT type; the former category encompassing splenic MZL (SMZL) and nodal MZL (NMZL). The rarity of these lymphomas and difficulty in distinguishing them from other low-grade B-cell lymphoma such as lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas hampers further understanding of disease biology. In an attempt to better characterize the genetic basis of these entities and compare acquired genetic changes based on this categorization we performed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (using the 244A array, Agilent) in a cohort of MZL cases. In total we analyzed 101 MZL, including 46 MALT (including 8 cases with t(11;18)(q21;q21)), 35 SMZL and 20 NMZL. Overall, 90.1% cases have copy-number abnormalities (CNA). Genomic complexity was greatest in MALT without t(11;18)(q21;q21)(4 CNA), followed NMZL (3.5 CNA), SMZL (3 CNA) and MALT with t(11;18)(q21;21)(1 CNA). Seventeen minimal deleted regions (MDRs) and 9 minimal amplified regions (MARs) were defined based on the presence in at least one entity with a frequency of 10% or higher. Gains of chromosomes 3, 12 and 18 were found in all entities. Deletion of 6q was the most common abnormality in MALT (21.1%) and, to less extent, SMZL and NMZL. Biallelic and focal monoallelic deletions on 6q23.3-q24.1 identified TNFAIP3 as the sole gene inside the common MDR between entities. Deletion of chromosome 13 was observed in all entities, but NMZL and MALT were characterized by whole chromosome deletions, whereas focal deletions on 13q14.3 ( MIR16-1/MIR15A ) were identified in SMZL. A subset of abnormalities was shared for more than one entity: deletions 9p21.3 ( CDKN2A ) and 11q21-q22 ( ATM ) were found in NMZL and SMZL but not in MALT; deletion 7q32.1-q33 was the most common CNA in of SMZL but was also found in MALT; gain of 6p was found in MALT and NMZL but not in SMZL. Other CNA were only found in one entity such as deletion of 17p13.3-p12 ( TP53 ) in SMZL, deletion of 15q25.3-q26.2 in NMZL. In addition to 17% of cases with the t(11;18)(q21;q21), extra copies of MALT1 , focal amplifications of REL and/or monoallelic/biallelic deletions of TNFAIP3 were identified in an additional 46% of MALT lymphomas. These CNA were identified alone or in combination, but all of them were mutually exclusive with the t(11;18)(q21;21), thus totalizing 63% of MALT lymphomas with abnormalities affecting regulator genes from the NF-kB signaling pathway. Moreover, depending on the anatomic site of the MALT lymphoma, the prevalence of CNA affecting the NF-kB pathways varies from 50% in lacrimal glands to 75% in salivary glands. Abnormalities affecting regulator genes of the NF-kB signaling pathways were identified in a significantly lower frequency in NMZL (30%) and SMZL (31%) entities, suggesting its differential role in the pathogenesis of different entities. Using this high-resolution approach we show that while many abnormalities are shared unique patterns of genomic gains and losses characterize subgroups of MZL. Extranodal MZL seems to have a higher propensity of constitutive genetic upregulation of NF-kB pathways. Furthermore, this study remarks the importance of this pathway also in the subgroup of MALT lymphomas without translocations affecting the pathway.
