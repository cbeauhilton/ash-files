    "abstract_text": "An abundant serum metal-binding protein, transferrin is a critical factor in mammalian iron homeostasis. As transferrin is essential for iron delivery for erythropoiesis, transferrin-deficient patients and mice develop anemia but also a paradoxical systemic iron overload. Iron overload results from deficiency in hepcidin, a peptide hormone synthesized largely by the liver that inhibits dietary iron absorption and macrophage iron efflux. Using transferrin-deficient mice, we have previously shown that transferrin deficiency leads to hepcidin deficiency via two mechanisms. First, the anemia and/or hypoxia that results from inadequate iron delivery to bone marrow actively suppresses hepcidin expression by the liver. Second, transferrin directly stimulates hepcidin expression by the liver independently of transferrin's role in erythropoiesis; this second mechanism is dependent upon hemojuvelin, a bone morphogenetic protein coreceptor essential for hepcidin expression that is mutated in juvenile hemochromatosis. Here we present data examining the reversibility of iron loading in transferrin deficiency. Measurement of tissue metal levels in adult transferrin-deficient mice demonstrated progressive and systemic iron loading yet minimal to moderate changes in levels of other metals. Treatment of adult transferrin-deficient mice with exogenous transferrin normalized red cell parameters and hepcidin levels and reduced iron load in most organs. To further investigate the reduced tissue iron burden in transferrin-treated mice, we employed iron-loaded cell lines to demonstrate that cellular iron efflux can be stimulated by transferrin and that this efflux is specific to iron but not manganese or zinc. Current studies focus on two goals. First, we are determining if the reduction in tissue iron load represents solely a redistribution of iron stores to the erythron or additionally excretion of iron via urine and/or feces by measuring whole body iron levels in mice before and after transferrin treatment. Second, we are identifying transporters required for mobilization of iron stores using expression profiling of known and putative iron transporters in mouse tissues and validating the role of transporters of interest using our cell culture model. Results of these studies and their implications will be presented. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
