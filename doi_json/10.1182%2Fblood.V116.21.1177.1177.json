    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1177 The adoptive transfer of antigen-specific T cells can be a powerful tool for immunotherapy of malignant diseases or infectious complications after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (Riddell et al., 1992; Heslop et al. 2010). Human adenovirus (AdV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections are frequent and often life-threatening complications post allogeneic stem cell transplantation. To reduce the time required to isolate antigen-specific T cells for adoptive transfer we have developed a method to isolate IFN-gamma-secreting CD4+ as well as CD8+ T cells after antigen-specific restimulation, the Cytokine Capture System IFN-gamma (CCS). Several preclinical studies demonstrate the efficient enrichment of functional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells specific for HCMV (Rauser et al., 2004), EBV (Hammer et al., 2007) or AdV (Feuchtinger et al. 2008) using the CCS. First clinical data of adoptively transferred HCMV-, EBV- or AdV-specific T cells into patients post allogeneic stem cell transplantation are very encouraging (Feuchtinger et al., 2010; Moosmann et al., 2010; Feuchtinger et al., 2006) with low T cell doses infused varying from 1\u201397\u00d710e3 cells/kg. We have now developed a cell processing device for the automation of the CCS procedure. Antigen-specific stimulation, labeling with the CCS reagents, washing steps, cytokine capture, magnetic enrichment and potentially expansion of the isolated cells are performed fully automated in a closed system. At the beginning of the procedure all components including the cellular starting product, antigen(s), reagents, buffer, and media are connected to a sterile single - use closed system processing set in the device . Due to usage of sterile filters and sterile docking the whole process runs under sterile conditions. The cellular end product can be obtained in the medium/buffer of choice, with the desired cell concentration and volume. The cellular starting product can be leukapheresis or bone marrow and the yield of antigen-specific T cells depends on the frequency of IFN-gamma producing cells. When starting with 1\u00d710e9 cells 1\u201320\u00d710e5 HCMV-specific T cells could be isolated. Cell processing is possible overnight and the isolated cells might be used directly after enrichment or after a phase of in vitro expansion. Using this cell processing device, IFN-gamma secreting HCMV-specific T cells were enriched to the same purity (>80% IFN-gamma secreting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) as with the semi-automated procedure. Cell loss during the procedure is markedly reduced, leading to an increased yield of IFN-gamma positive cells. An improved viability was observed resulting in better expansion rates. In conclusion, the automation in a closed system enables the fast and robust generation of antigen-specific T cells for adoptive therapy and will reduce clean room requirements.
