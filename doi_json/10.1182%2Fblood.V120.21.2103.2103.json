    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2103 Background: Recent studies suggest that patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have profound vitamin D (VD) deficiency. Limited data exist on the effect of VD deficiency on bone fragility in these patients. Objectives: To assess the prevalence of VD deficiency in adults with SCD and its consequences on bone metabolism and fragility. Methods: This prospective study included 56 SCD adult patients (mean age 29.8 \u00b1 9.5 years), in a clinically steady state. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry. Fracture history, BMD, avascular osteonecrosis, H-shaped vertebra and markers of mineral metabolism were compared between two groups of patients presenting very low (\u22646 ng/ml, n=26) (group 1) and low (>6 ng/ml, n=26) (group 2) 25(OH)D concentration, respectively. Results: Median 25(OH)D concentration was 6 ng/mL. VD deficiency (25(OH)D <10 ng/mL) was found in 42 out of 56 patients (75%) and secondary hyperparathyroidism in 40 (71.4%). History of fracture was documented in 17 patients (30.3%), osteopenia and/or ospeoporosis in 39.6% of patients. Overall, patients of group 1 were more likely to have sustained a fracture (42.8%) compared to patients of group 2 (17.8%) (p=0.04). These patients had also lower body mass index and significantly higher parathyroid hormone, C-terminal telopeptides of type I-collagen and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase serum levels. There was no difference between group for BMD, avascular osteonecrosis history, H-shaped vertebra, and disease severity markers. Conclusion: This study suggests that VD deficiency is a key feature in SCD-bone disease. It is highly prevalent and associated with hyperparathyroidism, bone resorption markers, and history of fracture. The optimal supplementation regimen remains to be determined.
