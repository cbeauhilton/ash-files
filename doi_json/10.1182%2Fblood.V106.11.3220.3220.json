    "abstract_text": "A 40 year-old Caucasian patient with severe familial hemophilia A (FVIII <1%) related to an intron 22 inversion developed at the age of 2 a high-responding inhibitor. His elder brother also suffers from hemophilia A with high-responding inhibitor. Until 2000, the patient had been treated either using activated prothrombin complex concentrates (Autoplex\u00ae and Feiba\u00ae) or factor VIII (FVIII) concentrates of human (1983) and porcine origin (1992), resulting respectively in an inhibitor level rise at 360 Bethesda Units (BU) and 1800 BU. Between 2000 and 2003, the patient received exclusively recombinant activated Factor VII (NovoSeven\u00ae), and his inhibitor levels stabilized at a plateau of 15\u201320 BU. Between 2000 and 2003, several life or function threatening bleeding episodes occurred, such as hematomas of the iliopsoas muscles, spinal cord hematoma with transient paraplegia. Furthermore, due to hemarthroses the patient was confined to a wheelchair. Given the major impact of the inhibitor on the patient\u2019s functional prognosis, life expectancy and quality of life, immune tolerance (IT) treatment was initiated, despite the high risk of failure (initiation 36 years after inhibitor onset, historical peak titer at 1800 BU, persistence of a plateau of 15\u201320 BU despite the absence of any stimulation with FVIII within the 3 last years). It started with an immunosuppressive drug, mycofenolate mofetil (Cellcept\u00ae) first given in may 2003 (no effect alone on inhibitor titer) and then in November 2003, infusions of a FVIII concentrate rich in von Willebrand factor, Factane\u00ae (LFB, Les Ulis, France) using 12,000 IU/day (150 IU/kg) of FVIII. The inhibitor peaked at 520 BU on D19 and was 0.5 BU by May 2004. Thus, the FVIII dosage was progressively reduced to 7000 IU/day. In July 2005, 24 hours after a 7000 IU FVIII infusion, inhibitor level was 0.7 BU, the residual FVIII level was 0.04IU/ml with a recovery of FVIIIc of 1.37%/IU/kg infused and a half-life of 4.9 hours. No significant change in the immunophenotype of peripheral blood lymphocytes was observed during this course. The patient\u2019s quality of life was dramatically improved, with no hospitalization required and no bleeding episode observed within the 16 last months. The patient can now stand and has returned to his previous social activities. These preliminary results show that this IT treatment, performed despite a high theoretical risk of failure, resulted in this patient in a dramatic clinical improvement, even though biological criteria of success have not yet been achieved. The respective roles of the type of FVIII concentrate, and of immunosuppression remain to be assessed, as well as the cost/benefit analysis on a longer follow-up period.",
