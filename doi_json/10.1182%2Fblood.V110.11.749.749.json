    "abstract_text": "The 2007 IWCLL guidelines indicate that a diagnosis of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) requires a B-cell count above 5,000/\u03bcL in the absence of other features; below this level the diagnosis is Monoclonal B-cell Lymphocytosis (MBL). There is little outcome data for MBL patients and it is not clear whether the detection of low levels of CLL cells, seen in 3% of the general population, is of clinical relevance. We have therefore investigated two hospital populations: the first with normal blood counts and no history of cancer; and the second MBL patients referred for investigation of a current or prior lymphocytosis. Blood samples from 1520 outpatients aged 60\u201380 with a normal blood count were screened: CLL cells were detected in 78/1520 (5.1%) with a median CLL cell count of 140/\u03bcL (range 15 \u2013 1,248). Chromosomal abnormalities were frequently detected in purified CLL-phenotype cells (deletion 13q14 in 15/38, trisomy 12 in 4/22) although poor-risk abnormalities (deletion 11q or 17p) were not detected. The median IgV H mutation was 6.6% (range 0.5 \u2013 13.7%) with 85% of cases showing >2% mutation from germline. The IgV H gene usage was heavily biased with a similar profile to mutated CLL. Detection of CLL cells in individuals with a normal count was not associated with increased mortality (estimated yearly rate 6.2% vs. 8.9% for matched controls, P=0.76) or risk of developing CLL as subsequent lymphocyte counts remained normal in all cases. A diagnosis of MBL was established in 309 of 2228 referrals for investigation of lymphocytosis between 1995 and 2000. A cohort of 185 MBL patients was monitored for a median 6.7 years (range 0.2 \u2013 11.8): the presenting B-cell count was a median 3,100/\u03bcL (range 30 \u2013 5,000), age 73 years (range 42 \u2013 96); IgV H mutation rate was 7.1% (range 1.3 \u2013 9.3%) with 96% of cases showing >2% mutation from germline. Progression to a lymphocyte count above 30,000/\u03bcL occurred in 15% of cases (28/185) and chemotherapy for progressive CLL was required in 7% (13/185). The absolute B-cell count was the only independent risk factor for an increasing disease levels. Neither IgVH mutation status nor CD38 expression predicted risk of disease progression or requirement for treatment. During follow-up 33% died: age above 70, hemoglobin concentration below 11 g/dL and T-lymphopenia (CD3+ 2,400\u03bcL) had significantly longer survival. Development of progressive disease did not predict overall survival: 7/13 patients requiring therapy remain alive at a median 1.9 years (range 0\u20138.6 years) after initiation of treatment. The total lymphocyte count had no impact on the risk of disease progression, time to treatment or overall survival. CLL-phenotype cells are genetically equivalent to CLL even when detected in the general population but are not associated with increased mortality or risk of progression to CLL when present below 1,500/\u03bcL. MBL patients with higher levels of CLL cells show a steady increase in disease levels over time with 1\u20132% per year requiring chemotherapy for progressive disease. As such, periodic monitoring is indicated but this should have a minimal impact on lifestyle as MBL patients are often elderly with multiple health issues. MBL is a newly described disorder which is related to CLL in a similar way that MGUS is related to myeloma."
