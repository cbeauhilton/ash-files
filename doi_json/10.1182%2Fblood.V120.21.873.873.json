    "abstract_text": "Abstract 873 Introduction: Clonal chromosomal anomalies have been well-characterized in the blood cells of patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and other hematological malignancies. However, the frequencies and types of chromosomal anomalies found in \u201cnormal\u201d people (i.e. no history of hematological cancer) are much less well known. Here we compare chromosomal anomalies in untreated CLL patients with those found in a large sample of people (n>50,000) recruited for genome-wide association studies in the Gene Environment Association Studies (GENEVA) consortium. This comparison provides information about the extent to which people without a prior history of hematological cancer have chromosomal anomalies that are characteristic of CLL. Methods and Results: The anomaly detection method focused on acquired, rather than inherited, chromosomal anomalies identified in whole blood samples. The method and results for the GENEVA subjects were published recently (Laurie et al. 2012, Nat. Gen. 44:642\u2013650). The same method was applied to pre-treatment samples from 220 CLL patients from US Intergroup Trial E2997 of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Acquired anomalies were detected as mosaic mixtures of normal disomic cells along with cells containing autosomal anomalies consisting of large (generally > 1 Mb) deletions, duplications and/or acquired uniparental disomy (UPD). Detection requires a large fraction of cells with the same abnormal karyotype (>5\u201310%), which is presumably of clonal origin. The subjects (of all ages) came from 12 different GENEVA studies, which addressed a variety of health conditions not directly related to hematological cancer (e.g. addiction and glaucoma). DNA was extracted mainly from blood samples (or, in 8% of subjects, from buccal/saliva samples) and genotyped on Illumina SNP mircroarrays. Clonal mosaic anomalies were detected from change points in intensity and genotype data (B Allele Frequency and Log R Ratio). We found 514 anomalies in 404 GENEVA subjects out of 50,222 examined (0.8% of subjects), although the prevalence increased with age. Clinical data from about 75% of subjects with a clonal chromosomal abnormality revealed that only a small fraction (2.8%, 95% CI=1.0 \u2013 4.7%) had a record of prior hematological cancer. In the ECOG study, blood samples from 220 CLL patients enrolled in protocol E2997 were genotyped on the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad_v1 array and clonal mosaic chromosome anomalies were detected using the GENEVA method. Chromosomal anomalies typical of CLL also were identified using interphase FISH (i.e. 6q23.3-, 11q22-, 12q15+, 13q14-, 17p13-) as previously reported (Grever, JCO 25:799-804). We found 489 anomalies in 148 patients of the 220 examined (67% of patients). The anomalies detected by FISH and SNP microarray were highly concordant (>98%). Although, the most common recurrent anomalies occurred on chromosomes 6, 11, 12, 13 and 17 in regions that span the FISH probes (except for chromosome 6), a majority of the anomalies detected by SNP data (74% of 489) were not detected by the CLL FISH panel. The frequency of large chromosomal anomalies was much higher in CLL patients than in GENEVA (67% versus 0.8% of subjects) and the overall composition of anomaly types found was also different. The fraction of anomalies consisting of acquired UPD was substantially higher in GENEVA subjects than in ECOG (34.0% versus 10.6%), while deletions were less common in GENEVA (50.1% versus 72.4%) and duplications were similar (15.6% versus 17.0%) (Chi-squared test p-value=3 \u00d7 10 \u221218 ). We compared the most commonly deleted regions (CDR) on each chromosome across studies. In the ECOG CLL patients, four chromosomes each had 10 or more overlapping deletions in their top CDR (6, 11, 13 and 17), which span the FISH probes (except for chromosome 6). The GENEVA subjects also had CDR on chromosomes 11, 13 and 17, which overlap those in ECOG. In addition, GENEVA had CDR spanning genes or regions implicated in myeloid malignancies, including DNMT3a on 2p, TET2 on 4q, PRAME on 22q, and a region on 20q13. Conclusions: These genotyping results of >50,000 subjects suggest clonal chromosomal anomalies may represent precursor states, or perhaps undiagnosed or unrecorded cases, of a variety of hematological malignancies. Further studies to validate these findings and explore the natural history of these genetic defects in individuals without hematologic malignancy are warranted.
