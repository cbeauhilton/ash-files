    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5210 Mature B-cell lymphomas with both BCL2 and MYC translocations to IG loci are rarely identified and most of them are classified as B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma (IL) in the new World Health Organization classification. In this study, we established a novel human lymphoma cell line, AMU-ML1, from pericardial effusion (PE) of a patient with IL before the initiation of chemotherapy and analyzed its characters. A 60-year-old male was admitted to our hospital because of PE and diagnosed as having IL from the atypical lymphocytes in PE. He was treated with rituximab plus hyper-CVAD and other regimens but died of lymphoma approximately 10 months after diagnosis without reaching complete remission. The cells from patient's PE at diagnosis were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). After 5 months of culture, cell proliferation became continuous with 10% FBS and the cell line was designated as AMU-ML1 (Aichi Medical University, malignant lymphoma, no. 1) after confirmation that the cells began growing again after the conventional freeze-thaw procedure. AMU-ML1 cells were positive for CD10, CD19, CD20, CD79a, HLA-DR and cytoplasmic lambda chain and negative for CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD13, CD23, CD33 and CD56 by flow cytometry analysis and showed a complex karyotypes including t(2;18)(p11.2;q21) and t(3;8;14)(q27;q24;q32) by G-banding analysis. This profile is consistent with the profile of the patient's cells. Spectral karyotyping and fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis of AMU-ML1 cells revealed that t(2;18)(p11.2;q21) was IGL/BCL2 and t(3;8;14)(q27;q24;q32) was BCL6/MYC , MYC/IGH and IGH/BCL6 . Subcutaneous transplantation of AMU-ML1 cells into NOD/scid mice treated with anti-asialo GM1 antibody resulted in formation of primary tumors. Thus, the AMU-ML1 cell line is useful for studying the biological consequences of IL with triple hit of BCL2 , BCL6 and MYC , and possibly invasion to PE of lymphoma.
