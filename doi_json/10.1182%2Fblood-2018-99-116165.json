    "abstract_text": "Introduction . The 2016 WHO criteria identified early primary myelofibrosis (early-PMF) as an individual entity with different clinical/laboratory presentations and a significantly better outcome compared to overt PMF. No information is available on the therapeutic effects of ruxolitinib (RUX) in the context of each disease separately. Aims . To report the differences between early and overt PMF patients (pts) treated with RUX in terms of baseline clinical/laboratory characteristics, response to treatment and toxicity. Methods . A clinical database was created in 23 European Hematology Centers including retrospective data of 537 MF pts treated with RUX from Jan 2011 to July 2018. Spleen and symptoms response (SR & SyR) to RUX were evaluated according to the 2013 IWG-MRT criteria. Hematologic toxicity and infections were graded according to the WHO scale. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated from diagnosis using the Cox proportional hazards regression model, with adjustment for the dynamic international prognostic score system (DIPSS) and left-truncation. Results . A total of 199 pts had a diagnosis of early (n. 59, 29.7%) or overt (n. 140, 70.3%) PMF confirmed by bone marrow biopsy at RUX start and were included in this analysis. At RUX start, median age was 68.4 yrs (26.5-88.9) and 66.3% of pts had a spleen palpable at \u226510 cm below the left costal margin (LCM) (median spleen length: 12 cm). Median hemoglobin value and total symptoms score (TSS) were 10.5 g/dL and 20 (0-80), respectively. DIPSS distribution was: intermediate-1 (50.5%), intermediate-2 (42.1%), high (7.4%). Molecular status was: JAK2 V617F 72.3%, CALR 13.7%, MPL W515K/L 3.1%, triple-negative 5%. Median time from diagnosis to RUX start was 22.4 mos (0.1-394). Compared to overt PMF pts, pts with early PMF started RUX with higher hemoglobin levels (median, 11.6 vs 10.4 g/dl, p=0.01) and lower circulating blast counts (p<0.001), and were more frequently at intermediate-1 DIPSS risk (69.6% vs 42.5%, p<0.001). RUX starting and 12-weeks titrated doses were comparable in the two groups. At 3 and 6 months, 43.1% and 48.9% of early-PMF pts achieved a SR, compared to 27.9% and 31.3% of overt-MF pts (p=0.04 and p=0.04, respectively). The rate of SyR was also higher in early-PMF pts at 3 months (82.5% vs 68.8%, p=0.05) and at 6 months (90.0 vs 73.7, p=0.02). In the first 12 months from RUX start, anemia/thrombocytopenia of all grades occurred in 75.6%/43.1% and 86.3%/60.0% of early and overt PMF pts, respectively (p=0.11 and p=0.03). At 3 months, anemia was more frequent in overt PMF pts (94.7% vs 80.0%, p=0.01), with 32.6% of pts having a grade 3-4 anemia compared to 17.8% in early PMF (p=0.02). The incidence of thrombocytopenia was also higher in overt PMF at 3 (51.5% vs 36.2%, p=0.05) and 6 (52.9% vs 35.8%, p=0.04) months, with only 2.2% and 2.5% of pts having a grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia, respectively. Seventy-five pts had at least one grade \u22652 infectious episode during RUX therapy. Considering death as competing risk, the cumulative risk of infections grade \u22652 was comparable in the two cohorts (p=0.4). Overall, 108 pts discontinued RUX (52.5% and 55.0% of early and overt PMF pts, p=0.7). Evolution into acute leukemia (AL) occurred in 21 pts. After a median follow-up of 23 months, 69 pts died (19 early), specifically because of progression of myelofibrosis (38%), AL (16.9%), infections (11.3%), hemorrhage/thrombosis (12.6%), second neoplasias (8.5%) or transplant-associated toxicity (2.8%), other causes (9.9%). OS (p=0.88) and PFS (p=0.86) were comparable in early and overt PMF pts. Conclusions . This study indicates for the first time that early PMF represents a category of pts that is projected to have better responses and lower toxicities from RUX treatmemt. In the setting of RUX therapy, a WHO-defined diagnosis may contribute to better identify pts who may deserve a strict monitoring during treatment.
