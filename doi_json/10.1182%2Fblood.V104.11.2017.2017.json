    "abstract_text": "Since t(8;21) and inv(16) disrupt core binding factor in AML and confer a favorable prognosis, these cytogenetic groups are often treated similarly, but hitherto have not been compared in a large study. We compared 144 adult AML patients (pts) with t(8;21) with 168 with inv(16) enrolled on the cytogenetic study CALGB 8461. t(8;21) pts were less frequently white ( P =.01), had lower hemoglobin levels ( P =.03), WBC ( P< .001) and % blood ( P< .001) and BM blasts ( P =.005), and had more frequently secondary chromosome aberrations ( P< .001) than inv(16) pts, who more often had extramedullary disease ( P <.001). Pts were induced with cytarabine/daunorubicin (AD) or cytarabine/daunorubicin/etoposide \u00b1PSC833(ADE\u00b1P). Complete remission (CR) was achieved by 89% of t(8;21) and 87% of inv(16) pts. Upon multivariable analysis (MVA), non-white race ( P =.006), lower platelets ( P =.01) and higher BM blasts ( P =.004) predicted negatively for CR in t(8;21), and lower platelets ( P =.009) and hepatomegaly ( P =.04) in inv(16) pts. Non-whites with t(8;21) had 5.7 times the odds of not achieving CR as whites. For the entire group (median follow-up 6.4 yrs), the estimated 5-yr overall survival (OS) and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) were 51% and 53%, respectively. Pts with t(8;21) showed a trend for shorter OS (46% vs 54%; P =.17) but no difference in CIR compared with inv(16) pts. Upon MVA, t(8;21) pts had worse OS than inv(16) pts (HR 1.5; P =.04), once adjusting for age, platelets, and WBC. Following first relapse, the 5-yr survival of t(8;21) pts (n=58) was shorter than that of inv(16) pts (n=74) (14% vs 36%; P =.01); in an age-adjusted model, the risk of death was 1.8 times higher for t(8;21) pts ( P =.005). In a subanalysis of pts <60 yrs, consolidation therapy with multi-course high-dose cytarabine (HDAC x3 or 4) significantly decreased CIR compared to single-course HDAC (x1) in t(8;21) (5-yr CIR, 35% vs 64%; P =.005) and inv(16) (5-yr CIR, 44% vs 70%; P =.03) pts. Upon MVA, consolidation with multi-course HDAC reduced CIR for both t(8;21) and inv(16), but other prognostic factors differed (see Table). For t(8;21), induction with ADE\u00b1P and higher platelets increased risk of relapse. However, relatively few pts received ADE\u00b1P so its prognostic impact requires confirmation. For inv(16), +22 and other secondary cytogenetic aberrations, and male sex were favorable prognostic factors.

Although these data should be confirmed prospectively, our analysis suggests that future studies should report the outcomes of pts with t(8;21) and inv(16) separately, and seek to identify and target therapeutically leukemogenic mechanisms accountable for these clinical differences.",
