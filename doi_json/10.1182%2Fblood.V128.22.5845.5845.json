    "abstract_text": "Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of auto-HSCT and allo-HSCT in the treatment of high risk peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL). Methods: From July 2007 to July 2014, 60 cases of high risk PTCL were analyzed retrospectively. Results: All 60 patients were at high risk group (carried with IPI\u22653), with a median age of 31 (13-55) years old. Of the 60 cases, 22 were PTCL-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), 22 with ALK negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK-negative ALCL) and 16 with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). Twenty-one (21/60) received allo-HSCT and thirty-nine patients (39/60) received auto-HSCT. Before receiving transplantation, 40/60 patients were in complete remission (CR), 2/60 patients were partial remission (PR) and 18/60 patients were not remission (NR). In the 40 CR patients before transplant, 10 patients received allo-HSCT and 30 patients received auto-HSCT. In the 20 PR/NR patients before transplant, 11 patients received allo-HSCT and 9 patients received auto-HSCT. After a median follow-up of 39 (range 1-96) months, the K-M analysis showed that the 5-year PFS for auto-HSCT and allo-HSCT were 61% and 60% ( P = 0.724). The 5-year OS for auto-HSCT and allo-HSCT were 62% and 61% ( P = 0.724). There were no statistically significant differences between the auto-HSCT and allo-HSCT. And the cumulative TRM of allo-HSCT and auto-HSCT were 16.5% and 0 (P=0.250) within 5-years after transplantation. At the end of the last follow-up, 7 patients relapsed in auto-HSCT group and 2 patients relapsed in allo-HSCT group, the 5-year cumulative recurrence rates of auto-HSCT and allo-HSCT transplantation were 37.2% and 10.1% (P=0.298), respectively. Conclusion: There was no significant difference in the long-term survival between auto-HSCT and allo-HSCT for high risk PTCL patients. The effect of allo-HSCT may be better for NR patients.
