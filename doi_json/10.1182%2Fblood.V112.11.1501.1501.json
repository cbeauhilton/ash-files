    "abstract_text": "Purpose: Chromosome 17 abnormalities define a group of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) ( Nahi, H. et al. Leukemia and Lymphoma 2008 ; 49 : 508 ) with poor outcomes. We analyzed the additional impact of chromosome 17 abnormalities (\u221217, \u221217p, \u221217q, der17) among patients with AML and cytogenetic abnormalities traditionally considered to be of adverse prognosis. Patients and Methods: 1086 patients with AML [excluding inv 16, t (8;21), t (15;17), Diploid/-y abnormality] were included in this analysis. Based on cytogenetic abnormalities patients were grouped into: \u22125,\u22127,\u22125and \u22127, complex. The following parameters were included in uni and multi-variate analysis: age, performance status, WBC, hemoglobin, platelets, marrow blast percentage, bilirubin, creatinine, albumin, LDH, chromosome 17 abnormality (yes/no). Results: Four hundred and fourteen (45%) patients achieved complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) and 267 (64.5%) patients relapsed. Two hundred seventy (24.9%) patients had abnormalities of chromosome 17. Abnormalities of chromosome 17 were associated with lower CR or CRp rate (p=0.02) and higher possibility of having cytogenetic abnormality of \u22125 or \u22127 (p<0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that patients with abnormalities of chromosome 17 had worse overall survival (OS) compared to patients without (p= 0.003)(Fig.1). Multi-variate analysis within cytogenetic subgroups showed that chromosome 17 abnormalities were associated with worse OS in patients with chromosome 5 abnormality(p=.02) (data not shown) and in those with complex cytogenetics (p=.04)(Fig.2) and not in patients with chromosome 7 (p=.17)or combined 5 and 7 abnormalities (p=.33). Similar analysis restricted to patients achieving CR/CRp after induction therapy showed that impact of chromosome 17 abnormalities on relapse free survival (RFS) mirrored their impact on OS. Conclusion: chromosome 17 abnormalities are associated with worse OS and RFS in patients with AML and adverse cytogenetics and have additional negative impact on the outcomes in certain well-known adverse cytogenetic subgroups.
