    "abstract_text": "Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a rare mast cell disease driven by the KIT D816V mutation in which mast cells accumulate in \u22651 tissues or organs resulting from clonal proliferation of abnormal mast cells in one or more extracutaneous organs. Most forms of SM are non-advanced (non-AdvSM). To date, the economic burden of non-AdvSM has not been well-studied among Medicare patients. This study compared direct healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and healthcare costs in Medicare beneficiaries with non-AdvSM and a matched cohort without SM. This study used Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-sourced 100% Medicare Fee for Service (FFS) claims (Parts A/B/D) and identified newly diagnosed non-AdvSM patients who had \u22652 medical claims for SM (ICD-10-CM Dx codes: D47.02 OR C94.30 OR C94.31 OR C94.32 OR C96.21) between 1/1/2017 and 12/31/2018. Patients were classified as non-AdvSM using a claims-based algorithm. The index date was the date of first observed SM diagnosis. Continuous enrollment in Medicare Parts A/B/D for 12 months pre- and post-index was required. Non-AdvSM patients were direct matched (1:1) on age, sex, race, index year, Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score to a non-SM control cohort. HCRU and costs were assessed during the 12 months pre- and post-index. Medical costs are reported in 2021 US dollars. Post match, there were 333 non-AdvSM and 333 non-SM patients. Mean [SD] age of the non-AdvSM cohort was 67.3 [11.7] and 67.8 [13.3] years for the control cohort. Over 25% of patients were <65 years of age at index and originally qualified for Medicare with a disability. Most (76%) patients were female, and 94% were White. During the 12-month pre-index period, non-AdvSM patients had more specialist physician office visits per patient (mean [SD]: 15 [15]) compared to non-SM patients (10 [13]; p<0.01). Non-AdvSM patients vs. controls had higher prevalence of asthma (29% vs. 15%, p<0.0001) and any malignancy (43% vs. 15%, p<0.0001) and lower prevalence of hypertension (58% vs. 68%, p=0.0103), diabetes with and without complications (19% vs. 34%; 8% vs. 15%; both p<0.0001), and renal disease (7% vs. 11%, p=0.0439). Non-AdvSM patients were also higher utilizers of corticosteroids (64% vs. 54%, p=0.0094), epinephrine auto-injectors (31% vs. 1%, p<0.0001), and omalizumab (6% vs. 0%, p<0.0001) compared to non-SM patients. Total (Parts A/B/D) healthcare costs in the 12-month follow up period were almost one-third higher for non-AdvSM patients than for non-SM controls (mean [SD]: $40,250, [$54,563] vs. $30,013 [$51,235]; p=0.0128). Pharmacy (Part D only) expenditures were also significantly higher ($13,938[$38,367] vs. $5,745 [$17,213], p=0.0004) and accounted for a greater proportion (34.6% vs. 19.1%) of total costs for non-AdvSM patients vs. non-SM patients. Non-AdvSM patients were high utilizers of physician office visits post-index compared to non-SM controls; more non-AdvSM patients had \u22651 oncology/hematology visit (36.9% vs. 12.9%; p<0.0001), or allergy/immunology visit (47.2% vs. 3.9%; p<0.0001) and mean [SD] visits per patient were higher among non-AdvSM patients (3.4 [11.8] vs. 1.3 [6.4] oncology/hematology, p=0.0049; 3.3 [9.5] vs. 0.2 [1.7] allergy/immunology, p<0.0001). Approximately 40% of non-AdvSM patients filled \u22651 prescription for an epinephrine auto-injector compared with <3% in non-SM patients (p<0.0001). More non-AdvSM patients had prescriptions for H1 antihistamines (13.8% vs. 5.4%, p=0.0002), oral and systemic corticosteroids (39.0% vs. 27.9%, p<0.0001; 51.7% vs. 32.1%, p=0.0079, respectively), leukotriene antagonists (40.5% vs. 8.7%; p<0.0001), and omalizumab (6.9% vs. 0.0%, p<0.0001). Compared to a matched cohort of non-SM Medicare FFS patients, non-AdvSM Medicare patients had 30% higher mean per patient total healthcare expenditures ($40,250 vs. $30,013), driven by more prescription drug use and higher utilization of outpatient resources, specifically visits to oncologists/hematologists and allergists/immunologists. Notably, this analysis does not represent the HCRU and costs of the most severe SM patients. Further research to understand the basis of the higher proportion of non-AdvSM patient in this analysis who were <65 years and qualified for Medicare with a disability (vs. 14% in all of Medicare), and the corresponding long-term medical costs among these patients is warranted.
