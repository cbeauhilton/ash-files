The aim of this study was to evaluate 1. the frequency of acquisition of additional chromosome abnormalities during the course of the disease (clonal evolution), 2. the pattern of acquired genetic abnormalities, 3. the association of karyotype at diagnosis and clonal evolution and 4. the impact of clonal evolution on transformation to AML and overall survival (OS). Patients and Methods: 988 MDS patients were evaluated by chromosome banding analysis (CBA) during the course of their disease. According to IPSS 729 (73.8%) cases showed a favorable karyotype, 146 (14.8%) patients an intermediate karyotype and 113 (11.4%) cases an unfavorable karyotype at first investigation. Progression to AML occurred in 180 of 988 patients during follow-up. Results : 2,454 chromosome banding analyses were performed in 988 cases (mean: 2.48 per case, range: 2\u20139). The median time between the first and the last evaluation was 12.5 months (range 1\u201360.6 months). Overall, in 171 of 988 patients (17.3%) clonal evolution was observed. Clonal evolution was detected between 1 and 56 months (median 14.3 months) after first evaluation and occurred later in patients with favorable than in patients with intermediate or unfavorable karyotype (mean 19.8 mo vs 15.5 mo vs 10.5 mo, favorable vs intermediate p=0.07, intermediate vs unfavorable p=0.05 and favorable vs unfavorable p<0.001). The abnormalities most frequently acquired during the course of the disease were +8, 7q\u2212/\u22127, and gain of 21q detected in 29 cases each, followed by loss of 12p (n=22), 5q (n=14), 17p (n=19), and 20q (n=12). Other recurrently acquired abnormalities were +13 (n=12), +1q (n=12), +3q (n=12), \u22123q (n=10). Clonal evolution was strongly associated with cytogenetic IPSS category: Clonal evolution occurred in 100/729 cases with upfront favorable cytogenetics (13.7%), in 32/146 patients (21.9%) with upfront intermediate cytogenetics, but in 39/113 cases (34.5%) with upfront unfavorable cytogenetics (p<0.001). In 100 patients with favorable cytogenetics and clonal evolution karyotype was intermediate at second evaluation in 43 cases (43%), unfavorable in 25 cases (25%) and stayed favorable in the remaining 32 patients (32%). In 32 patients with intermediate cytogenetics and clonal evolution karyotype shifted to unfavorable at second evaluation in 11 cases (34.4%) and stayed intermediate in 21 patients (65.6%). Progression to AML was more frequent in patients with clonal evolution as compared to patients without (52/171 (30.4%) vs 128/817 (15.7%); p<0.001). In Cox regression analysis the IPSS karyotype at first evaluation, the IPSS karyotype at second evaluation, clonal evolution and progression to AML were associated with OS (relative risk: 2.12, 2.15, 1.87, and 6.6; p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.011, p<0.001, respectively). In multivariate Cox regression analysis the IPSS karyotype at second evaluation and progression to AML were independently associated with shorter OS (relative risk: 2.0, and 6.1; p=0.013, p<0.001, respectively). Clonal evolution was associated with shorter OS (median 130.4 months vs not reached, OS at 5 years 72.3%vs 82.9%, p=0.01). Also in the subset of patients without transformation to AML outcome was inferior in patients with clonal evolution as compared to those without clonal evolution (OS at 5 years 78.2% vs 83.0%, p=0.05). Conclusions: 1. Clonal evolution was observed in 17.3% of patients with MDS. 2. The pattern of acquired abnormalities resembles the pattern observed in MDS at primary evaluation. 3. A higher frequency of clonal evolution and a shorter time to clonal evolution is observed in higher cytogenetic IPSS scores determined at first evaluation. 4. Clonal evolution is significantly associated with transformation to AML and shorter OS. 5. Sequential cytogenetic analyses allow the identification of subsets of MDS patients with a higher risk for transformation to AML and thus might guide treatment decisions in future.
