    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2845 Background: The MPNs are a family of chronic hematologic malignancies that typically affect pts ages 60\u201370s. However, there is growing awareness of hematologic malignancies developing in young pts, particularly a unique subset of pts known as AYAs. Little is known about incidence and outcomes of AYA pts with MPNs. Objectives: To determine the incidence and outcomes of MPN AYA pts. Results: We retrospectively reviewed charts of 1,616 MPN pts evaluated at our institution from 1986\u20132011. A total of 171 MPN pts (11%) were identified whose ages were 16\u201339, defined as AYA pts (per NCCN guideline recommendations on AYA cancers). Breakdown by MPN subtype: Essential Thrombocytosis, ET (n=78, 46% of AYA MPNs), Polycythemia Vera, PV (n=25, 15%), Myelofibrosis, MF(n=24, 14%), [3 post-ET, 1 post-PV, 20 primary MF], Hypereosinophilic syndrome, HES (n=22, 13%), and Systemic Mastocytosis, SM (n=22, 13%). Baseline characteristics of AYA MPN pts detailed in Table 1 . Only significant difference among AYA and non-AYA pts in terms of baseline CBC parameters was WBC: 6.4 (0.4\u2013108.4) in AYA MF vs 10.1 (0.6\u2013361) in non-AYA MF, p =0.0049. Analysis of median overall survival (OS), by Kaplan-Meier method, compared by age group (AYA vs non-AYA pts) and broken down by MPN subtype, shown in Table 2 . Table 1.

Overall, their 5- and 10- yr OS were significantly better than their older counterparts in the 3 major MPN subtypes (ET, PV, MF) and trended towards better survival but not statistically significant in HES and SM. Among AYA MPN pts, female predominance was noted among ET and SM pts and only 1 transformation event was noted among all MPN AYA pts in this analysis.
