    "abstract_text": "Abstract 28 Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) exhibit heterogeneity in self-renewal and differentiation activity, but the extent to which this is intrinsically determined and extrinsically regulated is still poorly understood. In the mouse, purities of HSCs can now be achieved to allow such questions to be addressed directly. Interestingly, tracking the outputs of large numbers of serial transplantable clones produced from single-cell transplants, or the clonal progenies of vector-marked/barcoded cells indicate the existence in mice of 2 subsets of HSCs with durable self-renewal ability. These 2 subsets are characterized by distinct lineage output programs that are maintained through the many HSC self-renewal divisions required to serially propagate a clone in vivo . To begin to ask whether similar subsets of human HSCs exist, we have created a diverse lentiviral library encoding an estimated >10 5 different barcode sequences and GFP, and then used this library to track the in vivo clonal outputs of transduced human CD34 + cord blood cells in xenografted mice. For this experiment, CD34 + cells isolated immunomagnetically to a purity of >80% were exposed to virus for 6 hours in the presence of growth factors and then immediately injected intravenously into 2 sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID-IL2R\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 mice (1.2 \u00d7 10 5 cells per mouse; 30% GFP + cells after 3 days in vitro ). Different subsets of human cells were then isolated by FACS from immunostained bone marrow cells aspirated sequentially from the femurs of the mice at intervals from 4\u201327 weeks post-transplant and the identity, number and size of clones in each established by next generation sequencing of barcoded amplicons derived from each sample. To identify barcodes arising from PCR and sequencing errors and calibrate clone sizes, we included 3 controls of 20, 100 and 500 cells with a known barcode at each datapoint. The data from these controls allowed a threshold of 20 cells per clone to be established with >95% confidence. We then compared the representation of clones among all samples from each mouse to derive the number and size of all clones detected, assuming a mouse contains 2\u00d710 8 bone marrow cells. This analysis revealed a total of 154 uniquely barcoded clones containing up to 2\u00d710 8 human hematopoietic cells in the 2 mice (8\u201330 \u00d7 10 6 in one and 4\u2013165 \u00d7 10 6 in the other at any single time point). Analysis of the representation of each clone over time showed successive waves of repopulation from different clones with lineage output profiles consistent with those obtained by transplanting separate fractions of CD34 + cord blood cells distinguished by their surface phenotypes. Specifically, we detected 50 clones (32% of all clones) that were not sustained at detectable levels beyond 9 weeks post-transplantation and were characterized by robust myeloid differentiation with variable B cell outputs at 4 weeks. Another 30 clones (19%) showed significant but also transient outputs of either or both the myeloid and B cell lineage, disappearing between week 9 and 16 post-transplant. Mature cell output was detected from a total of 74 clones (48%) at the 27 week time point, among which 36 (23%) were not evident during the first 4 months post-transplant. These late-appearing clones were mostly small (contributing up to 3 \u00d7 10 5 total hematopoietic cells at week 27) and made a significantly higher contribution to the total human myeloid population than to the total human B cell population. Notably, the 12 long term clones that showed robust mature cell output detectable in all 3 sites sampled at week 27 when the mice were sacrificed (left leg vs right leg vs pelvis) contained both myeloid and lymphoid cells but with large (>100-fold) variations in their representation in the 3 different sites. This latter finding suggests less trafficking of human cells between sites than expected from parabiotic mouse experiments or substantial differences in the differentiation control exerted in different locations. Additionally, from one of the mice, we obtained the first direct evidence of a large output of human T cells (>9 \u00d7 10 6 ) that was part of a long term multi-lineage clone detectable at 27 weeks post-transplant. This first use of a barcoding strategy to analyze the clonal dynamics of normal human CD34 + cells with in vivo repopulating activity demonstrates the power of this approach to analyze their lineage outputs and sets the stage for novel applications to expanded and transformed populations.
