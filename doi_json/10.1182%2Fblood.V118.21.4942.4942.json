    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4942 INTRODUCTION. Patients with Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) have an adverse outcome after relapse due to chemorefractory disease with conventional treatments. Bendamustine, a nitrogen mustard compound chemically related to the alkylating agents, has demonstrated high efficacy with a low toxicity profile in reported clinical trials. AIM. To analyze the Spanish experience in patients with relapsed/refractory MCL treated with Bendamustine. METHODS. Retrospective analysis of spanish experience in relapsed/refractory MCL treated with Bendamustine alone or in combination. This study has been approved by local ethical committees. RESULTS. Currently, there are 36 patients registered and 28 are available for this analysis. Patients'characteristics: 69% male, median age 65 years old (range 41\u201381), 87% ECOG\u2264 1, 83% Ann Arbor stage IV, 37% high risk MIPI and 9% blastic variant. Previous regimens were CHOP or CHOP like \u00b1 R in 42.5%, HyperCVAD/MtxAraC \u00b1 R in 42.5%, R-CVP in 9% and other regimens in 6%. Median number of previous treatments were 2.6 (range 1\u20136), all patients had received prior Rituximab and 73% had chemosensitive disease to the last treatment. Bendamustine regimen was R-B (R-375mg/m 2 D1, B-90 mg/m 2 D1-2) in 78% patients, R-B with B-70 mg/m 2 in 8%, B alone in 3%, R-B-Bortezomib in 3% and R-B plus consolidation (SCT, Y 90 Ibritumomab-tiuxetan) in 8%. Median number of cycles was 4.61 (range 1\u20137). G- CSF support was administered in 43% of cycles. Response: Overall response rate was 73%, with 43% CR & uCR and 30% PR. Survival: Median overall survival from diagnosis is 8,26 years (range: 1.6\u201311,6 years) without plateau. Median progression free survival (PFS) after Bendamustine treatment was 16 months (95% CI: 11.7\u201320.4), data that compares favourably with patients' PFS to previous therapy (12 months, 95% CI: 6.5\u201317.5). Median PFS for patients who achieved CR/uCR is 32.6 months (95% CI: 19.9\u201345.4) versus 11 months in patients with PR (95% CI: 3.9\u201318.8). With a median follow-up for surviving patients of 12 months since Bendamustine treatment, the estimated OS at 3 years is 47% (+ SD 14%). Toxicity: No treatment related mortality has been described so far. Over 152 cycles, only 10 hospitalizations due to febrile neutropenia were reported. No one case of lysis tumoral syndrome has been reported. CONCLUSION. Bendamustine plus Rituximab is a good rescue treatment in non selected pretreated patients with mantle cell lymphoma. CR rate and duration of response seem to reproduce in current clinical practice the good data reported in previous clinical trials and compares favourably with other available treatments. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
