    "abstract_text": "Background: The randomized, phase 3 DASISION trial demonstrated improved efficacy with dasatinib compared with imatinib in treatment-na\u00efve CML-CP patients (pts). Dasatinib was also well tolerated, and demonstrated a faster response at 3 months. Here, we report the results of the final, 5-year analysis of DASISION. Methods: Pts with newly diagnosed CML-CP were randomized to receive dasatinib 100 mg once daily (n=259) or imatinib 400 mg once daily (n=260) as previously reported. The primary endpoint was confirmed complete cytogenetic response (cCCyR) by 12 months. Long-term efficacy and safety data from pts with the predefined minimum 5 years of study treatment are presented. Results: Sixty-one percent of dasatinib-treated pts and 63% of imatinib-treated pts were still on their initial study therapy at study end. Cytogenetic and molecular response rates continued to be higher for dasatinib compared with imatinib (intent-to-treat population). Specifically, the rate of cCCyR by 5 years was higher with dasatinib versus imatinib (83% vs 78%, P =.187), as were the rates of major molecular response (MMR; BCR-ABL \u22640.1%; 76% vs 64%, P =.002) and MR 4.5 (BCR-ABL \u22640.0032% IS; 42% vs 33%, P =.025) by 5 years. Time to cCCyR (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]=1.46 [1.20\u20131.77], P =.0001) and MMR (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]=1.54 [1.25\u20131.89], P <.0001) in all randomized pts were faster with dasatinib ( Figure 1 ). Transformations to both accelerated (AP) and blast phase (BP) CML were reported on study or after discontinuation with fewer cases overall for dasatinib (n=12/259; 4.6%) compared with imatinib (n=19/260; 7.3%). Five-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were similar across treatment arms (PFS: 85% [dasatinib], 86% [imatinib]; OS: 91% [dasatinib], 90% [imatinib]). A higher proportion of pts on dasatinib achieved BCR-ABL \u226410% at 3 months (84%) compared with those on imatinib (64%). For pts who achieved BCR-ABL \u226410% versus >10% at 3 months, improved PFS, OS, and lower rates of transformation to AP/BP have been previously reported and were maintained at 5 years for dasatinib (PFS: 89% vs 72%, P =.0014; OS: 94% vs 81%, P =.0028; transformation n=6/198 [3%] vs n=5/37 [14%]) and imatinib (PFS: 93% vs 72%, P <.0001; OS: 95% vs 81%, P =.0003; transformation: n=5/154 [3%] vs n=13/85 [15%]). Between 4 and 5 years, the number of mutations increased slightly in dasatinib-treated pts (12 pts at 4 years; 15 pts at 5 years), and the spectrum remained the same. No new, unexpected safety events were identified in either treatment arm at 5 years. However, the total incidence of pleural effusion continued to increase each year in dasatinib-treated pts (29% overall). Most cases of pleural effusion were grade 1/2 (n=67/74), and the median time to first grade 1/2 pleural effusion was 114 weeks (range, 4\u2013299 weeks). Discontinuation of dasatinib due to pleural effusion occurred in only 15 pts (6% overall; 20% of pts who experienced a pleural effusion). Arterial ischemic events overall were not common, occurring in 12 pts (5%) on dasatinib and 6 pts (2%) on imatinib. Cardiovascular (CV) ischemic events and transient ischemic attack were reported in 10 and 2 dasatinib-treated pts, respectively. CV ischemic and peripheral arterial occlusive events were reported in 4 and 2 imatinib-treated pts, respectively. Of the pts with overall arterial ischemic events, 8 pts on dasatinib and 3 pts on imatinib had a history and/or risk factors for atherosclerosis. Fourteen dasatinib-treated pts experienced pulmonary hypertension by 2D echocardiogram, with right heart catheterization (RHC) performed in 1; 6 discontinued therapy. No pts were diagnosed with World Health Organization Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (confirmed by RHC). Conclusion: At 5 years, dasatinib 100 mg once daily has demonstrated superior outcome compared to imatinib 400 mg once daily as initial therapy for CML. This is manifested by a faster time to cytogenetic and molecular responses, with more pts achieving BCR-ABL \u226410% at 3 months, sustained higher cumulative rates of response, and a lower rate of transformation. The 5-year rates of PFS and OS were equal in both arms. After 5 years, no new safety signals have been reported. These consistent results suggest that dasatinib offers meaningful advantages for pts with newly diagnosed CML-CP and remains a standard of care in this setting.
