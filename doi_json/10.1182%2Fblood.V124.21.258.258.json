    "abstract_text": "Telomeres, the terminal complex of hexameric repeats and shelterin protein of linear chromosomes, shorten with every mitosis. Telomere attrition is accelerated in patients with mutations in telomerase complex genes ( Calado and Young, NEJM 2009 ) and with replicative stress, as in chronic bone marrow failure. Historically, male hormones were effective in some patients with aplastic anemia (AA), and case reports and retrospective observations have suggested hematologic improvement in patients with telomeropathies treated with male hormones. Exposure of normal lymphocytes and CD34+ cells to androgens increased telomerase activity in vitro, and in cells from individuals carrying loss-of-function TERT mutations to normal levels ( Calado et al. Blood 2009 ). We have conducted a phase I/II single-center trial (www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT01441037) assessing the safety and the effect of male hormones on telomere attrition in patients with telomere disease. Entry criteria included age-adjusted mean telomere content \u22641%ile, \u00b1 identified mutations in telomerase complex genes, and low blood counts (hemoglobin 1.5 g/dL or platelets >20,000/uL or neutrophils >500/uL). Twenty seven patients were enrolled, accrual commencing August 2011. Most patients had moderate (n=20) or severe (n=4) AA, one had myelodysplasia, and two pulmonary fibrosis. Median age was 41 years (range 17-66); 15 patients were females. There was only one severe adverse event possibly related to drug. Frequent reported symptoms were muscle cramping with dehydration and exacerbation of headaches. Changes in serum lipid profiles were observed in all patients, with increased serum LDL and decreased HDL. Severe elevation in liver enzymes was not observed. One death occurred on study, not treatment related (pneumonia in a pulmonary fibrosis case). Mean telomere content of leukocytes at enrollment was compared with mean telomere content at 6, 12, and 24 months on drug as well as available samples before starting danazol. Telomere attrition prior to protocol entry, determined by q-pcr, was estimated at loss of 227 bp/year (95% CI, 58-368bp; p=0.009). Androgen administration appeared to elongate telomeres: the average increase in telomere length at 6 months was 205 bp (95% CI, 82-329 bp; p=0.002), at 12 months 441 bp (95% CI, 263-620 bp; p=0.0001), and at 24 months 347 bp (95% CI, 87-607 bp; p=0.01). A similar trend of increase in mean telomere content with danazol was confirmed in flow-sorted lymphocytes. Hematologic response rate, as defined by protocol, was 67% at 3 months and 60% at 6 months. Nine of eleven patients who required RBCs became transfusion-independent; two of them also became platelet transfusion independent. Liver cirrhosis was present in 6 patients at enrollment; worsening of liver disease in one occurred with continued alcohol abuse. To date 8 patients have completed two years of danazol, all of them responders; 10 patients remain on danazol, and 9 patients stopped drug prior to 2 years. Blood counts in all patients have been stable with drug discontinuation, with median follow up of 258 days (range 31-335). In conclusion, male hormones are safe and efficacious in patients with inherited bone marrow failure associated with telomeropathies, producing clinically meaningful hematologic improvement. Increased mean telomere content in patients, suggests that in vitro demonstration of up-regulation by sex hormones of TERT and of telomerase enzymatic activity is the mechanism of action of androgens in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first successful prospective effort to favorably modulate telomere length by pharmacologic intervention in humans. Sex hormones may be useful in other conditions of accelerated telomere attrition, as for example after chemotherapy, and other drugs and small molecules may be usefully screened for their effects on telomerase in vitro. Disclosures Off Label Use: we want to determine if treatment with male hormone danazol is safe and improves hematologic response as first-line treatment in patients with AA and telomere disease(www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT01441037).."
