    "abstract_text": "A genome-wide scan in nearly 70,000 individuals showed that the common SNP rs8109288 in the first intron of the human TPM4 gene exerts an effect on the volume and count of platelets (Gieger et al. Nature 2011). We isolated a mouse line with an ENU-induced missense mutation in Tpm4 . Mice carrying this mutation exhibited dose-dependent macrothrombocytopenia, while other blood cell counts were normal. Bone marrow transplant experiments demonstrated that the phenotype is intrinsic to hematopoietic cells. Notably, Tpm4 insufficiency did not affect the life span or in vitro function of mutant platelets, and there was no evidence of an increased propensity to bleeding. Megakaryocyte numbers in the bone marrow were increased, although maturation as measured by ploidy appeared normal. Mutant megakaryocytes displayed altered morphology indicating fragmentation, and markedly decreased proplatelet formation in vitro. Based on Gieger et al., we examined the functional requirement for TPM4 in human megakaryocytes. We found that the localisation of TPM4 in proplatelet-forming megakaryocytes was extremely similar to the localisation in their mouse counterparts, suggesting an identical role. Furthermore, knock down of TPM4 by shRNA in human megakaryocytes did not affect maturation as measured by CD41 and CD42 expression, but significantly reduced the number of proplatelet-forming cells. The occasional megakaryocyte that did form proplatelets did not exhibit the typical \u201cbeads-on-a-string\u201d phenotype. Typically, one large bulb at the end of a protrusion or a string with no clearly distinguishable beads was observed. We therefore performed a look-up in the BRIDGE consortium database, which enrolled 542 cases with inherited bleeding and platelet disorders of unknown aetiology in the NIHR BioResource for exome sequencing. Calling of variants revealed single nucleotide variants with consequences in TPM4 which were absent from ~30,000 control haplotypes, in three BRIDGE cases. Two cases with a stop codon at residue 105 and R91H variant presented with macrothrombocytopenia and mild bleeding symptoms with platelet counts of 103 and 128 x10e9/L and volumes of 15.10 and 14.00 fl, respectively. The remaining case with variant D20N (not conserved, genomic evolutionary rate profiling score of 2.68 compared to 4.62 for the other variants) had a count in the normal range (232 x10e9/L) and a reduced platelet volume of 7.20 fl. Together, these results provide compelling evidence that Tropomyosin 4 is a crucial regulator of platelet production in mice and humans, being specifically required for the terminal stages of platelet formation. Our studies demonstrate that the common intronic variant exerts a subtle effect, whilst two extremely rare variants have a more robust effect on platelet formation leading to counts and volumes at the tails of the population distribution. The lack of concordance between mice and humans with regard to bleeding may be explained by strong modifiers at loci other than TPM4 . Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
