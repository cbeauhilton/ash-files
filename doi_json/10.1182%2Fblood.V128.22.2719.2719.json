    "abstract_text": "Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for 80% of acute leukemias and arises through clonal expansion and arrest of differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Depending on the AML subtype and age of the patient, AML patients have a 5-year survival rate of about 25%. AML is a genetically heterogenous disease, where chromosomal aberrations, point mutations in critical oncogenes as well as aberrant expression of key regulatory factors of hematopoiesis collude during transformation. c-MYB is an important hematopoietic transcription factor involved in proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages. It was first described as a viral oncogene of avian leukemia viruses and is upregulated or mutated in many leukemic subtypes as well as solid tumors. c-MYB interacts with other transcription factors or co-factors, which are essential for its transcriptional activity. In this regard, c-MYB transactivation ability is inhibited by a histone deacetylases recruiting corepressor complex containing SKI, TIF1BETA, NCOR and mSIN3A. c-SKI is a proto-oncogene and an inhibitor of TGF\u03b2 signalling. However, it acts not only as a transcriptional co-repressor but also as a transcriptional co-activator. Like c-MYB , c-SKI is upregulated in different solid tumors and leukemias. Though SKI activity is well described, transcriptional regulation of the SKI gene itself still remains unknown. Here, we deliver insight into the transcriptional regulation of the human SKI gene via the transcription factor c-MYB. Methods: In silico analyses were performed to identify potential MYB binding sites in the SKI regulatory region. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were used to validate the interaction between MYB and the potential SKI regulatory regions. Reporter gene assays were engaged to analyze MYB regulatory potential regarding SKI expression. RNAi experiments were performed to further examine transcriptional regulation of SKI by MYB. Since MYB is known to be downregulated by the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) valproic acid (VPA), MYB and SKI protein levels were analyzed in AML cell lines treated with VPA via Western Blot. Correlated protein levels of MYB and SKI were examined in the myeloid leukemia cell lines HL60, U937, THP1, NB4 and K562 as well as in primary cells of AML patients (n=27). Correlation of MYB and SKI transcript levels were performed in three different data sets of primary AML samples. The first cohort (n=7) was analyzed via RT-qPCR. Cohort 2 consists of cDNA microarray data of AML patients (n=17). Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA) of the gene expression profile of MYB and SKI of AML patients (n=542) were performed with the leukemia gene atlas (LGA). Results: In silico analyses revealed four putative MYB binding sites (MBS1-4) in the SKI regulatory region. Direct binding of MYB to the regulatory sites MBS2-4 of the SKI gene could be confirmed via ChIP experiments. Dual luciferase reporter gene assays comprising c-MYB binding sites present in the SKI gene locus further show c-MYB-dependent transcriptional activation of the reporter. RNAi experiments depleting c-MYB in leukemic cell lines resulted in the decrease of SKI protein levels and thereby reveal that c-MYB is essential for the induction of SKI gene expression. Accordingly, treatment of the AML cell lines with the HDACi VPA led to a decrease of MYB and consequently SKI protein levels. Consistently, we observed a positive correlation of MYB and SKI protein expression in leukemic cell lines and in samples of AML patients. Moreover, a highly positive correlation of MYB and SKI transcript levels could be observed in three different cohorts of AML patients, further confirming regulation of SKI expression by the transcription factor MYB. Conclusion: Our findings provide new insights in the transcriptional regulation of the proto-oncogene c-SKI by the oncogenic transcription factor c-MYB during leukemogenesis. c-MYB and c-SKI expression and functions are highly positively correlated in human AML suggesting that c-SKI is a mediator of c-MYB oncogenic potential. So far, various therapeutic approaches targeting MYB failed to be transferred to patients. In this regard, c-MYB and c-SKI represent promising marker and target proteins for novel HDACi-based therapeutic approaches in AML. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
