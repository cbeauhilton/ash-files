    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2887 Introduction: Cardiac involvement is the major cause of death in patients with immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL). Detection of cardiac involvement and risk stratification has been facilitated by cardiac biomarkers like troponin T (cTnT) and N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). A novel high sensitivity cTnT (hs-cTnT) assay has been developed, and we evaluated its diagnostic use with three questions in mind: 1) How do the cTnT and hs-cTnT perform in the AL amyloid staging system? 2) Does higher sensitivity add significant additional value in terms of prognosticating outcomes for patients with AL amyloidosis? 3) Can the current AL amyloidosis staging system be further improved upon? Methods: Stored serum samples (-20\u00b0C) from 224 pts with AL were analyzed for concentrations of hsTnT, TnT, and NT-proBNP on the E170 Modular analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). 99 th percentile reference limits were <0.014 and <0.010 mcg/L for hsTnT and TnT, respectively. Results: Median values for hsTnT, TnT, and NT-proBNP were 38 ng/L (range 0\u2013075.4), 0.017 mcg/L (<0.0\u20130.904), and 1230 ng/L (0\u201332, 226), respectively. The correlation coefficient between hsTnT and TnT was 0.972. Those classified by echocardiographic parameters as having (n=143) or not having (n=81) cardiac involvement had TnT concentrations of 0.04 and 0.01 mcg/L and hsTnT levels of 52.2 and 15.6 ng/L, respectively. The direct numeric result from the hs-cTnT result CANNOT merely be substituted for a cTnT result in the Mayo AL staging system since 14% of patients would be misclassified. The performance of the receiver operation curve derived hs-cTnT cut-point of 54 ng/L is a slight improvement over the direct substitution of 35 ng/L if replacement of one assay for another is required. An alternate staging option using hs-cTnT alone\u2014using the two thresholds14 ng/L and 54 ng/L (figure)\u2014performs as well as either the original Mayo AL staging system or a derivative system incorporating hs-cTnT with respective relative risks of death (95%CI) of 3.6 (2.3, 5.7), 3.8 (2.5, 5.9), and 3.3 (2.2, .50). On multivariate analysis, our newly described alternate 3 level, hs-cTnT alone staging system is independent of other factors including period of diagnosis, type of therapy, and NT-proBNP value, the last of which dropped out of the model. Alternate models using NT-proBNP and cTnT were explored, but none performed better than the original staging system or the new hs-cTnT system. Conclusion: The direct numeric result from the hs-cTnT result cannot merely be substituted for a cTnT result in the Mayo amyloid staging system. Consideration could be made for AL staging systems using hs-cTnT alone and relegating the NT-proBNP for measuring cardiac response.
