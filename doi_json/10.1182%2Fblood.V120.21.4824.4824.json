    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4824 Micro-RNAs are functional, non-protein coding RNA molecules and their transcriptions provided by intron or exon regions of the genome and non-protein coding regions of RNA genes. The role of micro-RNAs in acute leukemia has become the subject of research increasingly. In this study we aimed to identify micro-RNA profiles in the childhood acute leukemia that one of hematologic malignancies. Fourty nine patients who were diagnosed with acute leukemia and admitted to Cukurova University Faculty of Medicine Department of Pediatric Hematology between December 2010 and September 2011. Blood samples were taken twice in patient groups at diagnosis and during remission and plasma samples were stored. Blood samples were taken once in the healthy group and plasma were separated. The plasma samples were investigated by PCR analysis of micro-RNA. Acute leukemia was diagnosed by cytomorphological, immuno histochemical and flow cytometric studies. Thirtyone patients who were diagnosed with ALL and fortyseven healthy children as a control group were included to study. miR20a, miR25, miR92a, miR30c, miR106b, miR203, miR150, miR192, miR302c, miR184, miR218, miR320, miR342-3p, miR223, miR328, miR483-5p, miR376a, miR381, miR451, miR576-3p, miR548a levels were increased in newly diagnosed ALL patients when compared to healthy controls (p <0.05). The miR20b, miR342-3p and miR548a levels were found higher in healthy controls than the newly diagnosed ALL patients group (p <0.05) Healthy control groups when compared with pediatric ALL patients whose in remission; miR769-3p, miR20a, miR92a, miR16, miR27b, miR192, miR320, miR223, miR484, miR451 levels were found higher in healthy control groups than the patients. Newly diagnosed pediatric ALL patients compared with patients whose in remission; miR30c, miR106b, miR25, miR184, miR218, miR302c, miR483-5p levels were increased in newly diagnosed pediatric ALL patients than ALL patients whose in remission (p<0.05). miRNAs are thought to be identified at a different level of expression in normal and pathological tissues can be determined between the miRNAs that are effective diagnosis and treatment of human cancers. We showed the microRNA profils that may play new roles treatment of acute leukemia in the futures. Disclosures: Kilinc: ApoPharma Inc.: Research Funding.",
