    "abstract_text": "Background: Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) including polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and myelofibrosis (MF) are clonal hemopathies characterized by burdensome symptom profiles and impaired quality of life. Few studies have evaluated patient-reported outcomes during treatment with non-experimental pharmacological regimens. Aims: The Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Quality of Life (MPN-QOL) Study Group aims to objectively quantify MPN symptom severity, frequency and quality of life at baseline and throughout treatment with non-experimental therapies utilizing the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form - Total Symptom Score (MPN-SAF TSS; JCO 2012). In this abstract, we provide updated results for the prospective international cohort trial currently in active enrollment: the MPN Experimental Assessment of Symptoms by Utilizing Repetitive Evaluation (MEASURE) trial. Methods: This study aims to recruit 180 international ET, PV, and MF (including primary MF and post-ET or post-PV MF) patients receiving non-experimental medical therapy and/or phlebotomy. Patients complete the MPN-SAF for seven consecutive days at enrollment and repeat the survey for an additional seven consecutive days between 90 days and six months. Patients also complete the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) instruments at enrollment and on the first day of the second assessment. At visits, physicians acquired demographic, laboratory, physical examination, and radiographic data. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data. Results: Clinical Data The MEASURE trial opened for enrollment in 2012 and remains in recruitment phase with 15 participating international sites. To date, 39 patients have been enrolled and 25 have completed both study visits. Participants include ET (28%), PV (24%), and MF (48%; 50% primary MF, 8% post-ET, 42% post-PV) patients. The majority of patients are male (64%) and of expected age (mean 69.3, range 39-89) for the disorders. Seventeen percent had prior thrombosis, 9% required red blood cell transfusion, and none reported prior splenectomy or hemorrhage. Mean hematologic measures included hemoglobin 13.2 g/dL, WBC count 11.4 x10 9 /L, ANC 8.5 x10 9 /L, and platelets 514 x10 9 /L. Therapies received prior to enrollment included aspirin (n=16), hydroxyurea (n=11), phlebotomy (n=8), warfarin/clopidogrel/anticoagulation (n=8), erythropoietin (n=2), and interferon (n=1). The most common current MPN therapies were hydroxyurea (n=9), aspirin (n=9), interferon (n=4), and phlebotomy (n=2). Symptom Assessment In comparing MPN-SAF TSS mean symptom scores, all symptoms except bony pain improved between the first and second visits, including fatigue, early satiety, abdominal discomfort, inactivity, concentration, night sweats, itching, fever, weight loss, and overall quality of life (Figure1). Total MPN-SAF TSS scores improved from a mean of 32.3 to 25.9. On the EORTC, mean scores for physical, role, emotional, and social functioning improved from the first to the second visit (Figure 2). Cognitive functioning showed a slight decline. Global health status measure improved from 60.2 to 72.9. On the MDASI, symptom severity scores decreased from 3.6 to 2.8 from the first to second visit (Figure 3). Symptom distress measure decreased from 4.1 to 3.0. Discussion: Interim results from the MEASURE trial demonstrate that standard, non-experimental treatment regimens offer improvement in quality of life-related symptoms on multiple patient-reported survey instruments including the MPN-SAF TSS, EORTC QLQ-C30, and MDASI. Updated data including symptom correlations and mutational analysis to be presented at the 2016 ASH conference.
