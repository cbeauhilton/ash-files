    "abstract_text": "From Dec 2000 to Dec 2003, 390 children with SR-BCP-ALL (age: 1\u20139, WBC 10\u22123, or according to the exact level of positivity. Results: 1) 15% (51/336 pts) of the SR-BCP ALL have a detectable MRD at EOI 2) As expected, whatever the threshold, pts with D21 M2/M3 marrow are more likely to have a detectable MRD (p=.0017). But 43/316 M1 pts (14%) have a highly +ve (n=19;6%) or weakly +ve MRD (n=24 ; 8%). Surprisingly, only 1 out 20 M2M3 pts had a MRD > 10\u22122 while it is the case for 8 out 316 M1 pts (p=NS). If only pts receiving DNR are considered (DNR+ M1 pts and all M2/M3 pts), again pts with D21 M2/M3 marrow are more likely to have a detectable MRD (p=.0015). 3) If we compare the MRD levels in the 2 arms (DNR+ve or neg) in the 315/343 M1 pts evaluable for MRD: 136 pts in each arm had no detectable MRD; 16 and 8 have a weak positivity in the DNR\u2212 and DNR+ arm respectively while 10 and 9 have a weak positivity in the DNR\u2212 and DNR+ arm respectively: p= .29). If the exact level is considered, this absence of difference remains at all levels considered. Conclusions: 15% of the SR-BCP ALL have a detectable MRD at EOI after a three or four-drug induction. D21 M2/M3 pts are more likely than M1 pts to have a detectable MRD at EOI but 14% of the D21 M1 pts have a high (> 10\u22123) or very high MRD (> 10\u22122) which confirms the added value of MRD detection to classical morphology. The MRD level at EOI is not different in SR-BCP-ALL after a three or four-drug induction regimen. This is of paramount importance since EOI MRD is a surrogate marker for probability of relapse.",
