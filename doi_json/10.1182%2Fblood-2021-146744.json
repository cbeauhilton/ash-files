    "abstract_text": "Background: Tirabrutinib (TIR) is a second-generation oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor that is more selective for Btk than first-generation Btk inhibitors such as ibrutinib. TIR has been designed to improve the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib, and has been suggested to have a more favorable toxicity profile, including in atrial fibrillation (Af) and bleeding events. In 2020, TIR was approved in Japan for use in treatment-na\u00efve (TN) or relapsed/refractory (R/R) Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia (WM) based on the results of a phase II study (trial registration: Japic CTI-184057). In the phase II study, 18 TN (cohort A) and 9 R/R (cohort B) WM patients were enrolled. We previously reported the results of this study with data cutoff on August 28, 2019 (Sekiguchi et al., Cancer Sci. 2020 Sep; 111 (9): 3327-3337). In the report, major response rate (MRR, \u2265 partial response [PR]) was 88.9% in cohort A and 88.9% in cohort B. Overall response rate (ORR, \u2265 minor response [MR]) was 94.4% in cohort A and 100% in cohort B, with median follow-up period of 6.5 months (cohort A) and 8.3 months (cohort B). We herein report two-year follow-up data of this study (data cutoff on February 1, 2021). Methods: Phase II study was an open-label, prospective, single-arm study conducted at 19 facilities in Japan. TN or R/R WM patients with serum IgM \u2265 500 mg/dL were treated with TIR 480 mg under fasting conditions once daily until disease progression or clinically unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was MRR assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) according to the VI th International Workshop on WM (IWWM) criteria. Secondary endpoints included ORR, time to major response (TTMR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Results: The median follow-up period was 23.8 months in cohort A and 25.4 months in cohort B. Of the 27 patients, 5 patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events (1 patient with atypical mycobacterial infection), progressive disease (1 patient), physician's discretion (1 patient), or withdrawal by subject (2 patients). IRC-assessed MRR was 94.4% (95% CI: 72.7-99.9) in cohort A and 88.9% (95% CI: 51.8-99.7) in cohort B. IRC-assessed ORR was 94.4% (95% CI: 72.7-99.9) in cohort A and 100.0% (95%CI: 66.4-100.0) in cohort B. The rate of \u2265 very good PR was 33.3% in both cohorts. Median TTMR was 1.9 months (range 1.0-20.3) in cohort A and 2.1 months (range 1.0-3.7) in cohort B. Median PFS, OS and DOR were not achieved in either cohort. Two-year PFS rate was 94.4% in cohort A and 88.9% in cohort B. Two-year OS rate was 100% in both cohorts. Continued reductions in IgM were observed in patients who remained on treatment. In contrast, 3 patients who discontinued treatment for reasons other than withdrawal by subject had an increase in IgM after discontinuation. In the overall study population, the most common adverse events (AEs) were rash (44.4%), neutropenia (33.3%), and nasopharyngitis (25.9%). Two patients experienced Af and 9 patients experienced bleeding AE. All events of rash, nasopharyngitis, Af and bleeding AE were < grade 3. The most frequently reported \u2265 grade 3 AEs were neutropenia (22.2%), lymphopenia (18.5%), and leukopenia (11.1%). During this extended follow-up period, no new \u2265 grade 3 treatment-related AEs were observed except for hypertriglyceridemia observed in 1 patient. Conclusion: TIR demonstrated sustained efficacy in TN and R/R WM patients during the two-year follow-up period. Additionally, no new safety signals for TIR were identified compared to previous reports. TIR is a useful treatment option for WM.
