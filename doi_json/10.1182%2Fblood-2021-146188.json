    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The introduction of new treatments over the past 2 decades has improved survival outcomes in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), yet MM remains incurable. Despite therapeutic advances, most patients with MM eventually relapse and/or become refractory to treatment, and cycle through standard drug classes of proteasome inhibitors (PIs), immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), becoming triple-class exposed. These triple-class exposed patients represent a population with an urgent unmet clinical need and are a major focus for the development of new therapies. There are currently no prospective data outside of clinical trials on standard-of-care (SOC) in MM patients who progress after these treatment regimens. LocoMMotion (NCT04035226) is the first prospective study to assess the efficacy and safety of real-life SOC treatments in triple-class exposed patients with relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM). Initial analysis at a median follow-up of 3.7 months (range: 0.0-12.7) showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 20.1% (95% CI: 15.0-26.0), with only 5% of patients achieving very good partial response or better. Here, we report updated results from LocoMMotion with a longer median duration of follow-up (7.8 months), along with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) data. Methods: LocoMMotion is a non-interventional study of 246 patients across 10 countries (the US and 9 in Europe) and 75 sites. Patients (aged \u226518 years) with a documented diagnosis of MM were included if they received \u22653 prior lines of therapy or were double-refractory to a PI and IMiD; had measurable disease at screening; received at least a PI, an IMiD, and anti-CD38 mAb with documented progressive disease since their last line of therapy; and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) score of 0 or 1. Patient-level data and the most common SOC treatments were collected and analyzed during the study period (August 2019 through October 2020). Real-life SOC treatments were defined as those used in local clinical practice. Responses were assessed per International Myeloma Working Group response criteria. A review committee assessed the ORR (primary objective) of real-life current SOC as well as disease progression for the determination of PFS. Secondary objectives included evaluation of additional efficacy endpoints, including OS, and safety. Results: As of the data cut-off date of March 9, 2021, 246 patients were included with a median follow-up of 7.8 months (range: 0.1-16.9); 23 (9.3%) patients were from the US and 223 (90.7%) were from Europe. Median age was 68 years (range: 41-89), 133 (54.1%) were male, 180 (73.8%) had a baseline ECOG PS score of 1, and median time since initial MM diagnosis was 6.3 years (range: <1.0-22.8). Patients had received a median of 4.0 prior lines of therapy (range: 2-13); all patients were triple-class exposed, 185 (75.2%) were triple-class refractory, and 228 (92.7%) were refractory to last line of therapy. Ninety-three unique treatment regimens were used in the enrolled population, and 63% of patients were treated with a combination of \u22653 drugs. ORR with real-life SOC salvage therapy was 28.0% (95% CI: 22.5-34.1). For the 69 patients who responded, median duration of response was 5.1 months (95% CI: 4.4-NE). In all patients treated, the median PFS was 4.4 months (95% CI: 3.8-5.4), and median OS was 12.4 months (95% CI: 9.6-NE). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 192 (78.0%) patients; 122 (49.6%) patients had grade \u22653 TEAEs. The most common grade \u22653 TEAEs were anemia (9.8%), thrombocytopenia (13.4%), and neutropenia (11.8%). Nineteen (7.7%) patients died due to TEAEs during the study; the most common TEAE leading to death was infection (n=11). Eighty (32.5%) patients had ongoing SOC treatment after the median follow up of 7.8 months. The study is ongoing in 147 (59.8%) patients. Conclusions: Updated results of this first, prospective study of real-life SOC treatment in triple-class exposed patients with RRMM confirm rapid disease progression after application of salvage therapy and poor outcomes with currently available treatments. New treatment approaches with novel therapies are needed to improve outcomes in this patient population.
