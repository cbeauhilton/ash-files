    "abstract_text": "Background: The most common complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) in adults is vaso-occlusive crisis that is characterized by severe pain. These events can often be managed at home with oral analgesics, but if the pain is not controlled or the patient develops other associated problems, they seek care in an emergency department (ED). In the ED, they receive initial treatment with pain medications and are assessed for other complications such as infection and acute chest syndrome. If an individual's pain is not controlled in a short period of time, the majority of these patients are admitted to the hospital for inpatient management or placed in an observation unit (OBs) for 6-47 hours. The COVID-19 pandemic affected the Greater Newark community starting in mid March with the majority of all inpatient admissions (Ads) being COVID related through the end of May. It has been observed both at our medical center and nationally that during this time period and even afterwards, the number of ED visits and Ads had significantly fallen. The reasons for this finding may include fear of contracting COVID infection at the hospital, regular telemedicine (TM) calls to facilitate outpatient management, and an increase in the number of prescriptions of home pain medications. The purpose of this analysis was to examine patterns of ED visits, Ads, outpatient visits, prescription renewals and nurse (RN) and social worker (MSW) calls in order to determine the impact of COVID-19 infection on the local SCD community. Methodology: A retrospective review was undertaken of billing data and the EMR of all patients with SCD treated at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center (a 450 bed community-based academic tertiary care medical center) between January 2020 and June 2020. Data collected included the number of and reason for ED and OBs, Ads, the number of TM and outpatient visits, and MSW and RN telephone contacts. All patients 18 years of age and older were included. Overall, 100 adults with SCD received care between January and June. Results: Peak hospital COVID Ads, ED and OBs for all patients (SCD and non-SCD) occurred during the weeks between March 25 and May 24, 2020 with a daily inpatient census over 200 between April 7 and 24. SCD Ads at peak COVID (April-May) were significantly lower at 26\u00b12/month compared to 64\u00b111/month pre-COVID (January-February) (p= 0.04). ED and OBs were unchanged. During the peak of COVID, 10/93 (11%) SCD Ads (1 death) were COVID related with 80/96 (86%) for uncomplicated pain crises. MSW and RN called all patients proactively to offer support at onset of COVID pandemic. During this same time period, the number of MSW telephone contacts increased from 138\u00b137/month pre-COVID to 372\u00b121/month during COVID (p=0.02). RN contacts with SCD patients were stable and mostly were for pain prescription renewals. TM was initiated in March 2020 and an increase in these visits correlated with a fall in face to face physician visits: 83.5\u00b111/month pre-COVID to 39.5\u00b18/month peak COVID (p= 0.04), and TM 0/month pre-COVID and 31\u00b14/month peak COVID (0.01). Conclusion: The outbreak of COVID-19 in the community reduced the number of Ads for patients with SCD without an increase in ED and OBs visits. MD face-to-face encounters were reduced but outpatient care continued with the initiation of TM, regular RN contact with maintenance of pain medication prescriptions and a greater numbers of MSW calls for psychosocial support. Further investigation and understanding of the use of Ads for SCD care, and the reduction during COVID, may have implications for current SCD management. Disclosures Cohen: GBT: Speakers Bureau.",
