    "abstract_text": "Background : The posttransplant reconstitution of the \u03b1\u03b2 TCR repertoire correlates with the control of viral infections. We have previously demonstrated that using a limited number of patients cohort some had a skew of the V\u03b41+ TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ T cell repertoire after allogeneic HSCT, and that clonal predominance of V\u03b41+ TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ T cells was already present in blood of some donors and those clones were transferred to the recipients. The proliferation of V\u03b41+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells has been described in various infections including HIV, CMV and malaria. Although the functions of human V\u03b41+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in vivo remain obscure, aforementioned results have raised the hypothesis that V\u03b41+ T cells may have the repertoire against microorganisms widely infected in humans. Objective: We sought to explore the biological role for this T cell subset by investigating the reconstitution of the V\u03b41+ \u03b3\u03b4T cell repertoire after human allogeneic HSCT, and the cytotoxic activity against EBV-infected cells of this T cell subset isolated from the long-term survivor. Methods: The size distribution and sequences of CDR3 of TCR \u03b4-chains were determined by using an automated DNA sequencer. Immunophenotypes of the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. PBMCs were stimulated with autologous EBV-LCL in the presence of IL-2 followed by positive selection with a MACS TCR\u03b3/\u03b4 MicroBead kit. Positively selected \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes were cultured with irradiated autologous EBV-LCL and allogeneic PBMCs as feeder cells, PHA (1 \u03bcg/ml) and IL-2 (10 U/ml) for 7 days. V\u03b41 T cells were enriched by depletion of \u03b1\u03b2 T cells, V\u03b42+ and V\u03b43+ T cells with mAbs and an anti-FITC MicroBead kit and LD columns. Cytotoxicity was measured by standard 4-hr 51 Cr release assay. Results: We observed skewed TCR repertoires of the V\u03b41+ \u03b3\u03b4T cells in 27 out of 44 patients receiving allogeneic HSCT. The -WGI- amino acid motif was observed in CDR3 of clonally expanded V\u03b41+ T cells in half of the patients. A skew was also detected in certain healthy donors, and the V\u03b41+ T cell clone derived from the donor mature T cell pool was persisting in the recipient\u2019s blood even ten years after transplant. In addition, this T cell clone expanded in vitro against the stimulation with autologous EBV-LCL (Fig. 1), and the V\u03b41+ T cell line expanded in vitro from the same patient showed cytotoxicity against autologous EBV-LCL (Fig. 2). EBV-infected cells could also induce oligoclonal expansion of V\u03b41+ T cells in healthy individuals as well. Conclusion: The skewing of V\u03b41+ \u03b3\u03b4T cell repertoires may be the result of the responses to latently infectious antigens, and human V\u03b41+ T cells may have a role in the protection against EBV infection.
