    "abstract_text": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) derives from the malignant transformation of lymphoid progenitor cells with ~85% being originated from B-cell progenitors (B-ALL). Despite fairly good prognoses for most pediatric B-ALL patients, the outcome is fatal in over 50% of adult patients who have a recurrent or progressive disease and lack of effective therapeutic approaches. Therefore, novel treatment strategies with high efficacy and low toxicity are an unmet need for B-ALL patients, especially those with relapsed or refractory status. Angiogenesis is a process of new vessel formation that requires the participation of multiple proangiogenic factors (e.g., VEGF, PDGF, and FGF) and their corresponding receptors (e.g., VEGFR, PDGFR, and FGFR). Angiogenesis, a well-established feature of solid tumors, also contributes to leukemia progression and correlates with the involvement of specific sanctuary sites in ALL, highlighting that the perturbation of angiogenesis would be an attractive approach for ALL treatment. Anlotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase (TKI) inhibitor with a broad range of antitumor effects via the suppression of VEGFR, PDGFR and FGFR. Of importance, anlotinib has been approved for the treatment of advanced lung cancer in China. Here, we evaluated the antileukemia activity of anlotinib in preclinical B-ALL models and its underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, we observed that anlotinib significantly blunted the capability of cell proliferation and arrested cell cycle at G2 phase in B-ALL cell lines. Subsequently, we found that anlotinib resulted in remarkably enhanced apoptosis in B-ALL in vitro . To assess the in vivo antileukemia potential, we established a B-ALL patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model and then treated the B-ALL PDX model with anlotinib. As a result, oral administration of anlotinib pronouncedly delayed in vivo B-ALL cell growth and reduced leukemia burden with acceptable safety profiles in this model. As for the mechanism of action, the antileukemia effect of anlotinib was associated with the disruption of the role of VEGFR2, PDGFRb, and FGFR3. Moreover, we revealed that this drug blocked the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/ signaling, a pathway that is linked with angiogenesis and its proangiogenic regulators, including VEGFR2, PDGFRb, and FGFR3. In aggregate, these results indicate that anlotinib is a potent antitumor agent for the treatment of B-ALL via the inhibition of angiogenic relevant pathways, which provide a novel potential treatment intervention for patients with B-ALL who have little effective therapy options.

OffLabel Disclosure: Anlotinib originally designed by China is a novel orally active multitarget inhibitor that is evaluating in clinical trials against multiple solid tumors.",
