    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4950 Introduction: Despite improvements in outcome using chemoimmunotherapy, treating elderly patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains challenging. Reliable risk stratification beyond age is lacking and consequently elderly patients are often treated with reduced-dose therapeutic regimen with palliative intent. We retrospectively analyzed outcomes of DLBCL patients aged 65 and older treated at the University of Pennsylvania. Patients and method: We identified 41 patients (pts) with diagnosis of DLBCL and age >65 years. Median age was 74 years (range: 65\u201386). Eight pts (20%) were age 80 or older. There were no differences in IPI, elevated LDH, or bcl-2 expression, whereas bcl-6 expression was more common in patients >80 years with 75% (6/8) vs. 27% (24/33) (p=0.01). Overall, 31 pts were treated with R-CHOP, 2 pts with R-HyperCVAD and one pt with R-CVP. Seven patients with a median age of 77 years were considered too frail for standard chemotherapy and were treated with a \u201csplit R-CHOP\u201d regimen consisting of: rituximab 375 mg/m2 day 1, cyclophosphamide 375 mg/m2 day 1 and 15, adriamycin 25 mg/m2 day 1 and 15, vincristine 1 mg day 1 and 15 and Prednisone 50 mg day 1\u20135 and day 15\u201319. Results: Overall, the complete remission (CR) rate was 56% with seven treatment related deaths (17%). For patients between 65 to 80 years of age and deemed fit for standard chemotherapy (n=28), CR rate was 57% with four treatment related deaths (14%). Among patients over 80 and deemed fit for standard chemotherapy (n=6), the CR rate was 50% with 2 treatment related deaths (33%). Frail patients treated with the \u201csplit R-CHOP regimen\u201d (n=7) had a CR rate of 57% with one (14%) treatment related death. For all patients, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1 year with a median overall survival (OS) of 2 years. The median PFS for pts between 65 and 80 years of age treated with standard chemotherapy was 16 months. Median PFS in pts >80 years of age treated with standard chemotherapy was 7 months, whereas median PFS in frail pts treated with \u201csplit R-CHOP regimen\u201d was 11.7 months. Conclusions: Our data reveal interesting findings about elderly pts treated for DLBCL. PFS and OS in general are poor as has been reported by others. In our data set, pts>80 years considered fit for standard chemotherapy, had a shorter PFS then fit patients between 65 to 80 years. Intriguingly, PFS among frail elderly patients treated with a \u201csplit R-CHOP\u201d regimen appears to be superior to that of elderly deemed more robust who were treated with standard dose RCHOP-21. Though limited by small numbers, our institutional data suggest that frail patients can tolerate a modified R-CHOP regimen although survival remains short.
