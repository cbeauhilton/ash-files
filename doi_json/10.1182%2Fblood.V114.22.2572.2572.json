    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2572 Poster Board II-549 Introduction: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is commonly manifested through skeletal involvement. Besides the characteristic acute musculoskeletal pain, SCD is also associated with chronic skeletal complications such as osteopenia and osteoporosis. During bone resorption, the collagen cross-links pyridinoline (PYD) and deoxypyridinoline (DPD) are released into circulation with subsequent urinary excretion. Measurements of urinary PYD and DPD could serve as valuable tools in detecting osteoporosis in the follow-up of SCD patients but perhaps also in determining the severity of bone infarction during painful crises. Therefore we compared urinary concentrations of PYD and DPD of SCD patients during asymptomatic state and painful crisis with those of race- and age-matched healthy controls. Methods: Urinary concentrations of PYD and DPD, adjusted for urine creatinine, were measured in SCD patients both during asymptomatic state (n=38) and painful crisis (n=27) and healthy controls with normal HbA hemoglobin (n=25) using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results: PYD and DPD concentrations were higher in asymptomatic SCD patients compared to controls ((54.8 (41.5\u201368.6) vs. 44.1 (37.7\u201349.9), P =0.005 and 11.6 (9.3\u201315.2) vs. 8.5 (6.8\u201310.4), P =0.004 respectively), with further increments during painful crisis (63.3 (51.8\u201376.0), P =0.041 and 15.3(13.0\u201321.5), P =0.003 respectively). In the asymptomatic patients levels of PYD and DPD were significantly correlated to the degree of hemolysis. Conclusion: In sickle cell patients bone resorption is increased and significantly correlated to the degree of hemolysis, compatible with their susceptibility to osteopenia and osteoporosis. Measurement of pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline could have additional value as biomarkers of osteoporosis in SCD. During painful crises a further increment in bone degradation was observed.
