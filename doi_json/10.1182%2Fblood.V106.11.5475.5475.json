    "abstract_text": "Objective: To evaluate the therapeutic effect of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) on hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Methods: 20 patients with median age of 33.4\u00b111.3 (18\u201350) years received AHSCT, 7 of them were acute non-lymphoblastic leukemias (ANLL)(CR1 5, CR2 1, refractory/relapse 1), 2 were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)(CR1 2), 1 was chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML-CP2), 1 was chronic lymphoblastic leukemia(CLL-NR), 6 were malignant lymphoma (CR1 2, CR2 2, NR 2), 1 was multiple myeloma, 1 was breast cancer relapsed after resection 10 years and lung and bone metastases, 1 was small cell lung cancer. 2 or 3 of following agents: Cytarabine(Ara-C)3\u20134g/m 2 , Cyclophosphamide (CTX) 4\u20136g/m 2 , Etoposide (VP-16) 0.5\u20131.0g/m 2 , Semustine (me-CCNU) 300mg/m 2 , Melphala n(Mel) 140mg/m 2 , Thiotep a (TSPA) 600mg/m 2 , Carboplatin (CBP) 1.0g/m 2 , were combined as conditioning regimen in all patients. Among them 2 patients with ALL accepted additional total body irradiation (TBI). Results: All the patients have reconstituted bone marrow hematopoiesis after transplantation. None of them had the transplantation-related mortality. Among 20 cases, 15 achieved disease free survival (DFS) follow-up 36.5(2\u2013106) months. Conclusion: AHSCT might represent an effective approach for the treatment of some patients with chemosensitive solid tumor who are complete remission or part remission. Without compatible donors, patients with leukemia and malignant lymphoma at CR1 stage could receive AHSCT to reduce relapse and increase disease-free survival. It is suggest that have a obvious survival benefit from AHSCT.",
