    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4575 Introduction: The Busulfan Cyclophosphamide (Bu-Cy) combination has been broadly used as a myeloablative conditioning regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for patients (pts) affected by myeloid malignancies. The Busulfan Fludarabine (Bu-Flu), a newly introduced mieloablative conditioning regimen association showed, in several reports, less regimen related toxicities. We compared in a retrospective study the effectiveness and toxicity of both regimens. Patients and methods: From 12/2002 to 12/2010, 59 pts. affected by AML, CML, MDS and ALL were included in the study. Forty two pts. received Bu-Cy (oral Bu 1 mg/kg, every 6 hours \u00d7 16doses days -8 to -5 followed by Cy 60 mg/kg per day, days -4 and -3) and 17 pts. received Bu-Flu (Bu IV 3.2 mg/kg, once daily for four days and Flu 40 mg/kg /daily for four days, days \u2013 6 to -3). There were no statistical significant differences between both groups comparing age, diagnosis, disease status and CD34+ cells infused. Regarding the cell source there were more patients in the Bu-Flu group that received peripheral blood stem cells and cord blood and more pts in the Bu-Cy were infused with bone marrow. Another imbalance was the use of more unrelated donors in the Bu-Flu arm. GVHD prophylaxis was with cyclosporine A or tacrolimus and metotrexate. Protective isolation and antibiotic prophylaxis was used in both groups. Results: Considering hematopoietic recovery, there were no differences in days to reach 500 granulocytes and 20.000 platelets. Transfusion requirements were without statistical significant differences. The following observations were statistically significant (p<0.001) favoring Bu-Flu: Pts receiving Bu-Flu required less hospital stay days (27,8 vs 35,6) and less days on antibiotics (8,5 vs 16,5). Acute GVHD incidence grade II to IV was 23,5% in the Bu-Flu arm vs 50% in the Bu-Cy group. Early TRM was 5,9% with Bu-Flu vs 16,6% with Bu-Cy. Overall survival and relapse rate at 1 year of follow up was 70.58% vs 50% and 23.5 % vs 30.9% for Bu-Flu and Bu-Cy respectively. Conclusions: In our experience Bu-Flu is associated with lower toxicity, neutropenia duration, and severe acute GVHD. The overall survival and relapse rate are also superior. More pts should be included in a prospective study to confirm these observations. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
