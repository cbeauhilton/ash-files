    "abstract_text": "Background: Peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas (PTCL) account for approximately 10% of all non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas in the U.S. and Europe. PTCL, unspecified (PTCL-U), as classified by the WHO, is the most common subtype. The ability of high-dose therapy (HDT) and stem cell transplantation (SCT) to improve patient outcome was evaluated in the current study. Methods: All patients with PTCL-U evaluated at our institution who had tissue specimens available for review from January, 1994 to December, 2005 were identified and both clinical characteristics and treatment course obtained from the medical record. Results: 89 patients with PTCL-U were identified, with a median follow up of 13 months (range 1 month\u201312 years). The median age at diagnosis was 56 years (range 24\u201390). The IPI was low, intermediate or high in 34%, 44% and 22% of patients, respectively. On univariate analysis, age >60 (p1 (p60 (p=.0006) and ECOG performance status >1 (p=.007) were independently associated with poorer overall survival. Fifty-seven percent of patients were treated initially with an anthracycline-based regimen, most commonly CHOP (53%). Patients with a low (0\u20131), intermediate (2\u20133) or high (4\u20135) IPI experienced a 61%, 29% and 18% 5-year overall survival, respectively. Fourteen patients (16%) received HDT and autologous (n=12) or allogeneic (n=2) SCT, either at the time of a first partial or complete response (n=11) or at the time of first relapse (n=3). The median survival in those patients treated initially with an anthracycline-based regimen alone was 11 months (95% CI 0.6\u20131.6 years). Improvement in both 5-year overall (75% vs 24%, HR=5.6, 95% CI 2.0\u201323.4, p=.0004) and disease-free (60% vs 26%, HR=3.2, 95% CI 1.3\u20139.3, p=.008) survival was observed in patients who received HDT/SCT, as compared to patients treated with anthracycline-based therapy alone. Furthermore, improvement in both 5-year overall (80% vs 26%, HR=5.8, 95% CI 1.7\u201335.7, p=.002) and disease free (72% vs 26%, HR=3.8, 95% CI 1.3\u201315.8, p=.009) survival was observed in patients who received HDT/SCT at the time of a first partial or complete response when compared to patients who received anthracycline-based therapy. When patients who failed to achieve a first partial or complete response were excluded from the analysis, improved 5-year overall (80% vs 57%, HR=0.5, 95% CI 0.1\u20132.1, p=.4) and disease-free (72% vs 53%, HR=0.7, 95% CI 0.1\u20132.3, p=.5) survival were observed in patients who received upfront HDT/SCT, although this failed to reach statistical significance. The improved overall and disease free survival observed in patients receiving HDT/SCT, either at the time of a first response or at the time of relapse, remained significant when accounting for differences in the IPI. In conclusion, selected patients with PTCL-U may benefit from treatment with HDT/SCT following a first response to conventional anthracycline-based chemotherapy."
