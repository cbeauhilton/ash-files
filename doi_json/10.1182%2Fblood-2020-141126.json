    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) is a transcription factor family that regulates gene expression programs contributing to inflammation and cell survival. NF-\u03baB signaling occurs via two branches: classical and alternative, and is often enriched in somatic mutations of key pathway members in several lymphoid malignancies. Here, we reveal deregulation and constitutive activation of the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway in a subset of DLBCL patients with recurrent genomic loss of the gene encoding tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), a regulator of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Methods and Results: To uncover novel driver mutations of DLBCL pathogenesis and tumor maintenance, we performed Affymetrix SNP6.0 copy number analysis on 347 de novo DLBCL samples from patients uniformly treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP). We observed frequent, focal genomic loss of chr:14q32.31-32 which included TRAF3 and RCOR1 (7%, 22/313) in the minimally deleted region and an enrichment of activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype cases over germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) subtype cases, confirming previously published data (Chan et al, Blood 2014). RNAseq of these DLBCL samples revealed a significant reduction of TRAF3 mRNA in chr:14q32.31-32 deleted cases compared to copy number neutral cases (p=0.002). Next, we focused on characterizing the phenotypic consequences of TRAF3 loss in DLBCL. We used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to knock out TRAF3 in 2 GCB-DLBCL (DOHH2, OCI-LY1) and 2 ABC-DLBCL (HBL1, OCI-LY3) cell lines. We performed immunoblotting analysis of NF-\u03baB pathway members on cell fractionated samples of TRAF3 knockout cells and found increased levels of the NF-\u03baB inducing kinase NIK (a direct target of TRAF3-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome degradation) and a concomitant increased nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB transcription factor complex subunits RelB and p52. Proteasome blockade restored RelB cytoplasmic localization and reduced processed p52 protein in TRAF3 knockout GCB-DLBCL lines only, indicating other factors may contribute to alternative NF-\u03baB activation in ABC-DLBCL. Moreover, classical NF-\u03baB activation remained unaffected, highlighting the specific role of TRAF3 regulation on the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway in DLBCL. Consistent with these findings, TRAF3 knockout cells exhibited NF-\u03baB-dependent transcriptional upregulation by luciferase reporter activity and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine production (IL-6, TNF- \u03b2) by Luminex and ELISA . To study transcriptome changes as a result of TRAF3 loss-of-function, we performed RNAseq and differential gene expression analysis on wildtype and TRAF3 knockout DLBCL cell lines as well as primary DLBCL samples (N=347). We found enrichment of NIK and NF-\u03baB associated pathways in TRAF3 deficient DLBCL and uncovered additional enriched gene sets including those involved in cell cycle regulation, cell division and metabolism, suggesting a potential proliferative and survival advantage. Conclusion: Our findings link TRAF3 loss-of-function to clinical and gene expression phenotypes in DLBCL and highlight alternative NF-\u03baB activation as a pathogenically important pathway in both GCB and ABC subtypes. Future studies will be directed towards comprehensive evaluation of NF-\u03baB inhibitors for effective blockade of constitutive alternative NF-\u03baB activation in DLBCL.
