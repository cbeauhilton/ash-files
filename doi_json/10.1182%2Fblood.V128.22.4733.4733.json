    "abstract_text": "Introduction Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are becoming increasingly more prevalent as a preventative measure for venous thromboembolism and stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) 1 . NOACs are considered non inferior to Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in terms of efficacy and clinical trial evidence has suggested lower rates of complications with the use of NOACs 2 . There is limited published literature on the complication rates of NOAC use in the district general hospital setting. In this retrospective study, the bleeding rates amongst patients on oral anticoagulants in a district general hospital in the United Kingdom were established. Methods All patients prescribed a NOAC (Rivaroxaban, dabigatran or apixaban) or a VKA at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, a district general hospital in Harlow, United Kingdom, between 01/01/2015 and 31/12/2015 were identified from hospital pharmacy records. Electronic patient hospital records of these individuals were reviewed to identify indication for anticoagulation and any subsequent bleeding complications after initiating therapy as classified according to ICD-10 up until 31 st of June 2016. Results A total of 521 patients were prescribed a NOAC. 283 patients were prescribed Rivaroxaban, 217 patients Apixaban and 21 patients were prescribed Dabigatran. 969 patients were prescribed a VKA. From 1 st of January 2015 to June 31 st 2016, 5.9% of NOAC patients suffered a bleed requiring a hospital visit during this time, versus 7.1% patients on a VKA. Amongst patients prescribed a NOAC, common causes of bleeding included GI haemorrhage (34.5%), epistaxis (38.0%), haemoptysis (13.8%). Amongst patients prescribed a VKA, common causes of bleeding included gastrointestinal bleeding (57.0%), epistaxis (25.2%), haemoptysis (11.9%). Rates of cerebral haemorrhage were low in both groups (0.77% of patients prescribed a NOAC and 0.61% of patients prescribed a VKA). Conclusion This data illustrates real-world experience of bleeding rates requiring hospital admission of patients on NOACs and VKA. The data suggests a lower bleeding complication rate amongst a district general hospital patient population taking NOAC compared to VKA, in keeping with previously published data. References 1.
