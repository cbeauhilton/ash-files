    "abstract_text": "Children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have less than 60% overall survival despite aggressive chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. Only one third of the adult patients diagnosed with AML will be cured. AML blast cells from up to 30% of patients express a constitutively active receptor tyrosine kinase, FLT3-ITD, which contains an internal tandem duplication in the juxtamembrane domain. Patients with FLT3-ITD have a worse prognosis. ABT-869 is a novel multi-targeted small molecule inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases and is a potent inhibitor of FLT3, c-Kit, and all members of the VEGF and PDGF receptor families. To determine the effects of ABT-896 on AML cells, we treated AML cell lines, primary cells, and tumors in xenograft models with varying concentrations of the drug. In vitro viability assays showed that ABT-869 inhibited the growth of two different cell lines, MV-4-11 (human AML cell line that expresses FLT3-ITD) and BAF3-ITD (murine B-cell line stably transfected with the FLT3-ITD) at an IC50 of 10nM. ABT-869 was also effective against another mutation of FLT3, D835V, but at higher concentrations (IC50 of 100nM). Phosphorylation of FLT3 and activation of downstream signaling molecules, STAT5 and ERK, were inhibited by ABT-869 in a concentration-dependent manner. Cells were also stained with Annexin V-FITC and Propidium Iodide, and analyzed using FACS. ABT-869 induced apoptosis, caspase-3 activation, and PARP cleavage after 48 hours. To examine the in vitro effects of ABT-869 on normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, we performed methylcellulose-based colony assays with human bone marrow. No significant difference was observed in the number and type of colonies formed using BM cells treated with ABT-869 or control, up to a concentration of 1 micromolar. These results suggest that ABT-869 is not toxic to normal bone marrow progenitor cells at concentrations that are effective against AML cells. To examine the effects of ABT-869 in vivo, we treated SCID mice injected with MV-4-11, Baf3-ITD, Baf3-D835V, or Baf3-WT cells, with oral preparations of ABT-869. Complete regression of MV-4-11 tumors was observed in mice treated with ABT-869 at 20 and 40 mg/kg/day. No adverse effects were detected in the peripheral blood counts, bone marrow, spleen or liver. Histology of the tumors from the control-treated group showed a high degree of proliferation by Ki-67 staining, increased mitotic figures, and a well-defined tumor mass. In contrast, the tumors from mice treated with ABT-869 showed a number of apoptotic bodies by TUNEL staining and the presence of reactive, inflammatory cells. Interestingly, we also observed that mice that received ABT-869 the day after injection of AML cells remained tumor-free for over 2 months in contrast to the mice receiving the vehicle alone. Inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation was demonstrated in the tumors from mice treated with ABT-869. We are evaluating the activity of ABT-869 treatment of SCID mice injected with Baf3-ITD, Baf3-D835V, or Baf3-WT cells. NOD-SCID mouse models are currently being used to analyze the effects of ABT-869 on primary AML cells in vivo. Our preclinical studies demonstrate that ABT-869 is effective and nontoxic, and provide rationale for the treatment and prevention of relapse in AML patients.",
