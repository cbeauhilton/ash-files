    "abstract_text": "Purpose. Among pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the t(6;11)(q27;q23) MLL-AF6 translocation accounts for 26% of MLL-rearranged AML, and is associated with a worse prognosis (event-free survival of 23.3% at 3-years) compared to other forms of MLL-rearranged AML 1 . Gene expression profile analysis revealed a specific transcriptional signature, and this peculiarity has been explained by the mislocalization of AF6 protein into the nucleus with a consequent hyperactivation of the RAS pathway in these patients. The uncovered involvement of the RAS pathway in this AML subgroup provides the rationale for searching new therapeutical strategies to selectively target MLL-AF6 -rearranged cells. Methods. We established a cell-based drug screening assay, by testing a library of 1,280 pharmacologically active compounds (Lopac library, Sigma-Aldrich) on t(6;11)-rearranged ML2 and SHI-1 cell lines. Compounds (used at 10\u03bcM) which decreased cell viability by at least 50% (by ATP measurement) were further tested in different AML cell lines (HL60, as well as NOMO1 and THP1, both t(9;11) MLL-AF9 rearranged), to exclude those with broad anti-leukemic activity and to focus specifically over MLL-AF6 action. Finally, functional studies were performed for the compounds resulted selective for the MLL-AF6 rearrangement in cell lines and patient's primary blast cultures and the most promising drug was tested in vivo using NSG mice. Results. Of 1,280 compounds, 104 and 93 impaired cell proliferation of ML2 and SHI-1, respectively. 73 were found efficacious over HL60 and, thus, excluded. Then, the remaining 20 compounds were evaluated in other MLL-cell lines (NOMO-1 and THP-1), and finally 10/20 resulted active selectively on t(6;11)-rearranged cell lines. The selected compounds were Arvanil, CP-100356 monohydrochloride, Fluspirilene, CID2858522, Eupatorin, ANA-12, BAY 61-3606 hydrochloride hydrate, Ara-G hydrate, Tyrphostin 47, Thioridazine hydrochloride and were also confirmed to impair viability over t(6;11) primary blast cultures from patients. Among them, we were particularly interested in Fluspirilene and Thioridazine, these compounds being both antipsychotics working as dopamine receptor (DR) antagonists and FDA approved. By flow cytometry we showed the DRs (DR-1 to DR-5) expression in ML2, SHI-1, NOMO-1, THP1 and SKNO-1 whereas HL60 resulted devoid of DRs. Blasts from t(6;11)-rearranged patients (n=3) expressed DRs as well. Treatment of the cell lines with Fluspirilene and Thioridazine triggered apoptosis induction in SHI-1, and to a lesser extent in ML2, due to autophagy activation, whereas no effects were observed on HL60, NOMO-1, THP1 and SKNO-1. Clonogenic assay showed that after 24 hours of treatment self-renewal ability of SHI-1 and ML-2 significantly decreased, with no effects observed in other cell lines. Same results were obtained in primary cultures from patients t(6;11), without toxic effects on healthy bone marrow cells, confirming the drug specific activity over leukemia proliferation, and with Thioridazine being more active. NSG mice were then flank injected with t(6;11) cells and treated with Thioridazine 12 mg/kg; treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo (compared to mice treated with DMSO, p<0.05). By western blot and phospho-flow cytometry analysis we explored which pathway was DRs mediated, and identified a dramatic decrease of MEK and ERK phosphorylation since 6 hours post-treatment, indicating that the RAS pathway was involved. Conclusions. This study led to the identification of DRs expression in myeloid blasts, and revealed their role in leukemia maintenance exclusively of the t(6;11)-rearranged AML. We identified a series of new compounds to be prioritized for further analysis in MLL -AML; in particular Thioridazine deserves further investigation as a novel therapeutic strategy to improve outcome of t(6;11)-rearranged patient's. 1 Pigazzi M, et al Leukemia. 2011 Mar;25(3):560-3.
