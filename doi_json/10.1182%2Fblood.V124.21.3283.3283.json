    "abstract_text": "Introduction A presence of activating mutations in NOTCH1 gene has been recently associated with reduced survival and chemo-immunotherapy resistance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, a prognostic significance of the NOTCH1 mutations with respect to TP53 mutation status has not been fully explained yet. Methods An examined cohort included 409 patients with CLL enriched for high risk cases; in 121 patients consecutive samples were investigated. To determine the TP53 mutation status, a functional analysis of separated alleles in yeast (FASAY, exons 4-10) combined with direct sequencing was performed; the ambiguous cases were retested using an ultra-deep next generation sequencing (MiSeq platform; Illumina). The presence of NOTCH1 hotspot mutation (c.7544_7545delCT) was analyzed using direct sequencing complemented by allele-specific PCR in the selected samples. In several patients harboring concurrent NOTCH1 and TP53 mutations, single separated cancer cells were examined using multiplex PCR followed by direct sequencing. A correlation between mutation presence and patient overall survival, time to first treatment and other molecular and cytogenetic prognostic markers was assessed using Log-rank (Mantel-cox) test and Fisher's exact test, respectively. Results The NOTCH1 and TP53 mutations were detected in 16% (65/409) and 27% (110/409) of the examined patients, respectively; a coexistence of these mutations in the same blood samples was observed in 11% (19/175) of the mutated patients. The detected increased mutation frequency attributes to more unfavorable profile of the analyzed cohort; in the TP53 -mutated patients missense substitutions predominated (75% of TP53 mutations). As expected, a significantly reduced overall survival in comparison to the wild-type cases (147 months) was observed in the NOTCH1 -mutated (115 months; P = 0.0018), TP53 -mutated (79 months; P < 0.0001) and NOTCH1 - TP53 -mutated patients (101 months; P = 0.0282). Since both NOTCH1 and TP53 mutations were strongly associated with an unmutated IGHV gene status (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0007), we reanalyzed the IGHV -unmutated patients only and interestingly, the impact of simultaneous NOTCH1 and TP53 mutation presence on patient survival was missed in this case (P = 0.1478). On the other hand, in the NOTCH1 and/or TP53 -mutated patients significantly reduced time to first treatment was identified as compared to the wild-type cases (41 months vs. 25 months in NOTCH1 -mutated, P = 0.0075; 17 months in TP53 -mutated, P < 0.0001; and 18 months in NOTCH1 - TP53 -mutated patients, P = 0.0003). The similar results were observed also in the subgroup of the IGHV -unmutated patients, with the exception of patients carrying sole NOTCH1 mutation (P = 0.2969). Moreover, in the NOTCH1 - TP53 -mutated patients an increased frequency of del(17p)(13.1) was found in comparison to the TP53 -mutated patients only (72% vs. 56%); this cytogenetic defect was not detected in the patients with sole NOTCH1 mutation. Our results might indicate, that NOTCH1 mutation could preferentially co-selected with particular, less prognostic negative type of TP53 defects. Notably, in our cohort the NOTCH1 mutation predominated in the patients harboring truncating TP53 mutations localized in a C-terminal part of the TP53 gene behind the DNA-binding domain (P = 0.0128). Moreover, in one of the NOTCH1 - TP53 -mutated patients the analysis of separated cancer cells revealed a simultaneous presence of NOTCH1 mutation and TP53 in-frame deletion in the same CLL cell. In contrast, in the other examined NOTCH1 - TP53 -mutated patient the concurrent NOTCH1 mutation and TP53 missense substitution (with presumed negative impact on patient prognosis) were found in different CLL cells. Conclusions The parallel presence of NOTCH1 hotspot mutation might be detected in a significant proportion of TP53 -mutated patients and it seems to be associated with less prognostic unfavorable TP53 mutations. Nevertheless, these preliminary data should be further confirmed in a large cohort of patients.
