    "abstract_text": "Background: Substantial efficacy has been demonstrated with bortezomib (Bor)-containing regimens for the treatment of refractory/relapsed (RR) patients with transplant-ineligible (TI) multiple myeloma (MM). However, the dosing schedules for induction therapy and the significance of maintenance therapy using Bor in clinical settings have yet to be standardized. Discontinuations and dose reduction of Bor owing to severe adverse events (AEs) such as peripheral neuropathy (PN) and infection are frequent causes of adjustments to the standard 9 cycles of Bor/dexamethasone (BD) therapy used for induction in clinical practice. We have previously demonstrated that a change in Bor administration to a schedule of weekly or longer intervals had similar or greater efficacy for patients with RR-MM including transplant-eligible (Tokuhira M, et al. Leuk Res. 35:591-7, 2011). To investigate the efficacy of this modified Bor dosing schedule in the treatment focusing of TI-RR-MM, we retrospectively analyzed 22 patients receiving weekly-BD induction followed by a modified schedule of biweekly or longer intervals using Bor as maintenance therapy in a single institution. Methods: Data on the 22 TI-RR-MM patients treated with BD therapy in our institution were retrospectively analyzed. The induction therapy consisted of intravenous injections of Bor (1.3 mg/m 2 ) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in combination with dexamethasone (10\u201320 mg) on days 1 and 2 after Bor infusion, every 5 weeks. After BD induction, Bor maintenance was initiated with a schedule of biweekly or longer intervals. The dose of BD could be reduced based on AEs or other social aspects at the discretion of the treating physician. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the period between BD initiation of treatment to the last follow-up. Results: The median age of patients at the time of BD induction was 72.6 years (range, 49\u201384 years), and the subtypes of MM were the IgG type in 14 patients, IgA type in 6 patients, and BJP in 2 patients. Twelve patients were men and 10 were women. On the basis of the International Staging System classification, the clinical stage was I in 3 patients, II in 16 patients, and III in 3 patients. The median number of prior treatment regimens was 2.0 (range, 1\u20136). The median follow-up duration was 4.3 years (inter-quartile range, 3.0\u20137.8 years). Ten patients were alive, and 12 patients had died at the time of reporting. The median duration from the start of the first line treatment to BD initiation was 1.8 years (range, 0.1\u201314.8 years). The median number of BD induction cycles was 2.0 (range, 1\u20136), and 8 patients (36%) achieved a partial response (PR), although the other 14 patients (64%) showed stable disease or only a minimal response. Although AEs such as PN and gastrointestinal tract symptoms developed in 10 of 22 patients during BD induction, all 22 patients could move on to the maintenance phase. The median duration of Bor maintenance was 14.5 months (range, 1.8\u201376.5 months). Three patients were still receiving maintenance therapy at the time of reporting. Six patients (27.2%) received maintenance therapy for over 2 years, and 3 (13.6%) received it for over 4 years. The median OS was 3.6 years (range, 0.4\u20136.5 years), and the duration of Bor therapy from induction to the last administration was 2.5 years. The median progression free survival was 1.6 years (range, 0.3\u20136.5 years). During maintenance therapy, 5 patients achieved a PR. The reasons for cessation of Bor maintenance therapy were AEs in 8 patients and progressive disease in 11 patients. No patient died during Bor administration in this study. Discussion: We retrospectively analyzed 22 TI-RR-MM patients receiving modified BD therapy. Pantani L et al. reported the results of using BD therapy for 85 RR-MM patients, and demonstrated that twice-weekly Bor administration resulted in a clinical response rate of 19% and a median OS of 22 months (Ann Hematol, 2014). Although the clinical response rate in our study was inferior to that of Pantani L et al., the median OS in our study was superior (3.6 years) than those of previous reports. Because the majority of patients in this study were frail or elderly, the early decision to change to maintenance therapy before they developed severe AEs resulted in a good clinical outcome and a longer OS. Continuing BD therapy without a satisfactory molecular response might be an attractive therapeutic approach for TI-RR-MM patients. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
