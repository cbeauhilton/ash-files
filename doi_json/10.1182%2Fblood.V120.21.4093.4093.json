    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4093 Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation has become a common procedure for treatment of hematopoietic malignancies and autoimmune disease. Despite significant advances in HSC transplantation, the morbidity and mortality of ablative conditioning and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remain limitations to application in the clinic. However, these risks can be overcome through less toxic nonmyeloablative conditioning and cell depletion strategies to remove GVHD causing-cells while retaining engraftment enhancing-tolerogeneic cells. We were the first to discover CD8 + /TCR \u2212 graft facilitating cells (FC) in mouse bone marrow. The addition of as few as 30,000 FC to 10,000 HSC significantly enhances engraftment of HSC in allogeneic recipients without causing GVHD. FC also potently enhance engraftment of limiting numbers of syngeneic HSC. Human CD8 + /TCR - FC comprised 1.1% \u00b1 0.27% of total G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (mPBMC). In the CD8 + /TCR - FC, 48% of cells expressed CD3\u03b5 + , 43% were FoxP3 + , 43% were CD11c + , 19% were CD19 + , and 30% were HLA-DR + . Approximately 55% of FC are also CD56 dim/- , and the remaining population is CD56 bright . The morphology of human CD8 + /TCR \u2212 FC with Wright-Giemsa staining under light microscopy suggested that the human FC population is heterogeneous. Here we evaluated if human FC enhance human HSC or progenitor homing to bone marrow of NOD/SCID/IL-2r\u03b3 null (NSG) mouse recipients. CD45 + CD34 + HSC and CD8 + /TCR \u2212 /CD56 dim/- FC were sorted from mPBMC. NSG recipients were conditioned with 1100 cGy of total body irradiation (TBI). 24 hours after TBI, 100,000 HSC with or without 300,000 CD8 + /TCR \u2212 /CD56 dim/- FC were transplanted into conditioned NSG recipients. Recipients were euthanized 16 hours after transplantation. Bone marrow was harvested from femurs and tibias of recipients and plated in Colony Forming Culture (CFC) Assays. Recipients of HSC plus FC generated significantly more colony formation (colonies = 110) compared with HSC alone (colonies = 65) ( P = 0.011), suggesting that CD8 + /TCR \u2212 /CD56 dim/- FC enhanced homing of HSC or progenitors to bone marrow. To test if human CD8 + /TCR \u2212 /CD56 dim/- FC facilitate engraftment of human HSC in NSG mice, 300,000 CD8 + /TCR \u2212 /CD56 dim/- FC were mixed with 100,000 HSC and transplanted into NSG recipient mice conditioned with 325 cGy TBI. Mice that received HSC alone served as controls. At 30 days after transplantation, PBL typing showed that 34% (10 of 29) recipients of HSC alone engrafted. In contrast, 78% of recipients (n = 23) of HSC plus CD8 + /TCR \u2212 /CD56 dim/- FC engrafted, and donor chimerism in PB was 1.1% \u00b1 0.8% and 4.1% \u00b1 1.3% ( P <0.05), respectively. At 6 months after transplantation, NSG recipients of HSC + CD8 + /TCR \u2212 CD56 dim/- FC exhibited persistent donor chimerism in PB (9.1% \u00b1 6% vs. 3.8% \u00b1 3.5%) ( P <0.05) and significantly higher levels of donor chimerism in spleen (26.3% \u00b1 11.8% vs. 12.3% \u00b1 9.8%) ( P <0.05) and BM (11.6% \u00b1 4.8% vs. 2.9% \u00b1 1.3%) ( P <0.05) compared to recipients of HSC alone. Our data indicate that CD8 + /TCR \u2212 /CD56 dim/- FC facilitate homing of human HSC or progenitors and enhance engraftment of human HSC in NSG recipient mice.
