    "abstract_text": "Background: Treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has remained relatively unchanged over the past few decades. Standard-dose cytarabine and idarubicin (7+3 IA) or daunorubicin (7+3 DA) induction regimen have been recommended for AML induction therapy by global guidelines. Mitroxantrone, a type II topoisomerase inhibitor, disrupts DNA synthesis and DNA repair, has been recommended as a salvage treatment for refractory/relapsed AML or induction therapy for elderly patients. Objective: To compare the the clinical response and adverse events of Idarubicin regimen ( IA) with mitoxantrone and cytarabine (MA) in the treatment of newly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) . Methods: This retrospective study evaluated 164 patients with newly diagnosed AML who received either IA (idarubicin 10mg/M 2 , d1-3; cytarabine 200mg/d, d1-7) or MA regimen (mitoxantrone 10mg/M 2 , d1-d3; cytarabine 200mg/d, d1-7) as induction therapy from September 2010 to November 2017 at Guangdong General Hospital. The primary end point of this study was complete response and complete response with incomplete blood count recovery (CR/CRi), with secondary end points were adverse event rates and days of granulocyte and platelet recovery. Results: A total of 164 patients , 90 patients were males and 74 females, the median age was 41 (range:14~64) years old. There were 88 patients received IA regimen and 76 patients received MA regimen. There was no significant difference in clinical features and molecular biological characteristics in two groups (P>0.05). The CR/CRi rate was 72.3% and 64.0% (P=0.263) in IA and MA group after the first induction regimen, respectively. And the accumulated CR/CRi rate was 85.9% and 75.7% in two group, respectively (P=0.109). The common adverse reactions in the two groups were myelosuppression and infection , but with no statistical difference (P>0.05) in the incidence and grade of serious. The grade 4 and grade 5 neutropenia were 95.3% vs.98.7% and 4.7% vs. 1.3%, P>0.05 in IA and MA group respectively. And thrombocytpenia were 72.9% vs.63.2% and 4.7% vs. 1.3%, P>0.05. There was no significant difference in the incidence and severity of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory, skin, liver and kidney injury between the two groups (P>0.05). The median days of intravenous antibiotics (including antifungal drugs), neutrophil recovery, platelet recovery and the units of platelet and red blood cell suspension transfusion had no statistical difference in two groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: This retrospective study implied mitoxantrone with standard-dose cytarabine (3+7 MA) regimen has similar efficacy and outcome to the idarubicin with standard-dose cytarabine (3+7 IA) regimen for newly diagnosed AML, without increasing the incidence of adverse event rates.
