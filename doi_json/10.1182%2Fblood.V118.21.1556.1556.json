    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1556 P110\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4 isoforms are catalytic domains of phosphoinosityl-3-kinase (PI-3K) which is frequently constitutively active in blast cells from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. RNA and protein from all 4 isoforms were ubiquitously expressed in 32 AML samples which also showed expression of p-Akt Ser473, indicating PI-3K activation. Treatment of AML patient blast cells (n=45) with the p110\u03b1 selective inhibitor PI3-Kinase alpha inhibitor 2 and p110\u03b4 selective inhibitor PCN5603 (Piramed Pharma,UK) caused dose dependent kill of AML colony forming cells (CFC) and inhibition of p-Akt Ser473 expression. In contrast, the P110\u03b2 and p110\u03b3 selective inhibitors TGX-221 and AS-604850 showed little AML CFC kill. AML samples were more sensitive to PI3-Kinase alpha inhibitor 2 and PCN5603 killing than normal bone marrow or normal peripheral blood (Median IC 50 =1.8\u03bcM for 45 AML-CFC and 4.3\u03bcM for 8 normal CFC for PI3-Kinase alpha inhibitor 2. Median IC 50 =1.9\u03bcM for 45 AML-CFC and 6.2\u03bcM for 10 normal CFC for PCN5603). There was no significant difference between the IC 50 and IC 90 of p110\u03b1 and \u03b4 inhibitors against AML CFC from samples with or without the FLT3 ITD. There was a weak correlation between the IC 50 of the PI3-Kinase alpha inhibitor 2 or the IC 50 of PCN5603 and the ratio of pAkt/total Akt (R 2 = 0.23 and 0.24, respectively, p<0.05). RNAi inhibition of p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b4 decreased the corresponding isoform's RNA and protein expression and caused AML CFC kill and inhibition of p-Akt Ser473 expression. There was a strong correlation between the percent AML CFC kill and RNA knockdown (R 2 = 0.67) and between inhibition of p-Akt and p110 protein expression (R 2 = 0.90 for \u03b1 and 0.82 for \u03b4). Thus, p110\u03b1 and \u03b4 inhibition may achieve selective targeting of malignant rather than normal CFCs. Furthermore, treatment of AML cells with PCN5603, decreased survival of AML long-term culture- initiating cells (AML LTC-IC). In contrast, less toxicity toward normal bone marrow LTC-IC was observed (IC 50 =0.08\u03bcM, \u22642\u03bcM and 1.33\u03bcM for 3 AML samples and IC 50 =3.09\u03bcM, 2.63\u03bcM, >10\u03bcM and >10\u03bcM for 4 normal bone marrows). Selective inhibition of p110\u03b1 and \u03b4 isforms of PI-3K kills AML progenitors including candidate leukemic stem cells (AML LTC-IC) with relative sparing of analogous normal cells suggesting that these molecules could be therapeutic targets in AML.
