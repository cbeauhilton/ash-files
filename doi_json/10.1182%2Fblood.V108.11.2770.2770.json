    "abstract_text": "Background: Follicular lymphoma grade 3 has a natural history that is more akin to that of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The addition of rituximab to standard CHOP has resulted in improved response and survival in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Information about outcomes in follicular lymphoma grade 3 is lacking. Methods: A single institution retrospective review of patients with follicular grade 3 lymphoma evaluated at the UTMDACC from 1999 to 2004. Patients were located from the UTMDACC lymphoma database. All patients were initially treated with R-CHOP. Results: Forty-five patients were identified: 51% male, 47% \u226560 years, and 87% follicular grade 3b. The LDH was elevated in 24%, ECOG performance status was >1 in 2%, and >1 site of extranodal involvement was present in 10%. Stage distribution was 11% stage I, 11% stage II, 42% stage III, and 36% stage IV, bulky disease (>7cm) was present in 11%, and B symptoms occurred in 13%. Beta-2 microglobulin was elevated in 57% with values >3 \u03bcg/dL in over 50%. IPI distribution was: 46% IPI Low, 38% LI, 11% IH, and 4% IPI High. Overall response rate was 100% with 96% complete responses. Relapse rate by IPI category was 24% for Low IPI, 18% for IPI LI, and 40% for IPI IH, and 100% for the two patients with High IPI. With median follow-up of 33 months, three year failure-free survival (FFS) is 73% (95% CI: 59 to 87%). One patient died (2%) with an overall survival (OS) at three years of 97% (95% CI: 93 to 100%). Conclusion: The addition of rituximab to CHOP provided a high response rate and excellent early survival in this group of mostly good prognosis patients. Relapses were still seen; longer follow-up is needed.",
