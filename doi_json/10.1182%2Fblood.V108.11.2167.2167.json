    "abstract_text": "Multitargeted ABL inhibitors have been developed to simultaneously inhibit various pathways associated with proliferation in BCR-ABL+ diseases. Dasatinib (Bristol Myers Squibb) is a potent inhibitor targeting ABL, SRC, and other tyrosine kinases. SRC kinases are required for progression through the initial phase of mitosis. Centrosomes play a fundamental role in mitotic spindle organization, chromosome segregation and genetic stability. We sought to evaluate the activity of dasatinib on proliferation, centrosome status, spindle formation, and cell cycle progression in vitro and in vivo. Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF), Chinese hamster embryonal fibroblasts (CHE), and the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS were treated with serial concentrations (1nM-10\u03bcM) of dasatinib for 3 weeks. Effects of dasatinib were compared with data achieved with the ABL inhibitors imatinib (Novartis, 5\u201320\u03bcM) and nilotinib (Novartis, 0.5\u201320\u03bcM), the specific SRC inhibitor PP2 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem, 0.1\u20132\u03bcM), the ABL/LYN inhibitor INNO-406 (Innovive, 0.1\u20132\u03bcM), and solvent control. Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from 18 patients (pts, 10 m, 8 f; median age 57 yrs, range 26\u201375) treated with dasatinib (70mg bid) after imatinib failure for a median of 11 mo (range, 3\u201316) were investigated. 17 pts had chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase. One patient suffered from a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. For comparison, 3 untreated CML pts and 3 healthy individuals were evaluated. Cell proliferation was determined in liquid culture incubated with serial dilutions of the inhibitor. Centrosome morphology and spindle formation were evaluated after pericentrin and \u03b1-tubulin staining, respectively. Cell cycle progression was analyzed by FACS and expression of EG5 by immunofluorescence microscopy. Dasatinib induced a G1 cell cycle arrest in all cell lines tested and in pts associated with a shift to 1n DNA ploidy and absence of EG5 as a marker for G2 phase/mitosis. In vitro, centrosomal aberrations and delay of spindle formation were observed in a dose dependent fashion. In pts, centrosome alterations were found in a median of 17% (range, 10\u201315) of cells. Disturbed spindle formation was observed in 9/18 pts. In comparison, incubation with imatinib and nilotinib was associated with centrosome aberrations but not with defects of spindle formation and G1 arrest. PP2 induced S-phase arrest; centrosome aberrations were observed at higher dosages (1\u20132 \u03bcM) only, spindle formation was not affected. INNO-406 was associated with both centrosome aberrations and disturbed spindle formation. In pharmacological doses, proliferation of BCR-ABL neg. cell lines was inhibited after dasatinib treatment, but not after incubation with imatinib, nilotinib, PP2, or INNO-406. In conclusion, dasatinib blocks the G1/S transition and thereby inhibits cell growth in normal and neoplastic cells. In addition, it induces both centrosomal and spindle aberrations. Effects of dasatinib are not based on SRC inhibition alone but may be associated with the combination of SRC and ABL inhibition or with non-specific effects on multiple kinases. Therefore, dasatinib should be defined as a cytostatic drug with a strong targeted component resulting in a preferential inhibition of cells harboring a specific target, like BCR-ABL.",
