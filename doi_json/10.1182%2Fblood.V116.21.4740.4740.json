    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4740 Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) affect up to 600,000 individuals and account for ~100,000 deaths in the United States each year, according to The Surgeon General's Call to Action (CTA) To Prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism (2008). Oncology patients, particularly those who are hospitalized or undergo chemotherapy, are at increased risk for DVT/PE. Mortality is greater among patients with cancer and venous thromboembolism (VTE) than among those with cancer alone. In response to the Surgeon General's CTA, the National Blood Clot Alliance (NBCA), a national, community-based, non-profit organization dedicated to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of thrombosis and thrombophilia, conducted a survey to benchmark DVT/PE awareness among the general public and several at-risk patient groups, including oncology patients. The literature contains little information about at-risk patient knowledge, and almost no information about general public knowledge of VTE, making this the first, large survey of both public and at-risk patient awareness of DVT/PE. The survey was conducted in November 2009, among a representative cross-section of 500 adults, >20 years, participating in online research panels. For comparison, the identical survey was conducted among a sample of 500 adults, >20 years, screened from an online research panel, who had received a cancer diagnosis or experienced recurrence of cancer within the past 6 months, or who were on active cancer treatment. Evaluations comparing survey responses provided by oncology patients who, in connection with their treatment, did require a hospital stay versus those who did not require a hospital stay showed no statistically significant differences in DVT/PE awareness between the two subgroups. Among all oncology patients surveyed, 24% said that they had heard of a medical condition called DVT, compared to 21% of the general public. Among all respondents who said that they knew what a DVT was (unaided) or who were able to correctly identify DVT on an aided checklist, 61% of oncology and 53% of national respondents said they could name DVT risk factors. The most frequently mentioned DVT risk factor was \u201csitting for a long time\u201d among both the oncology (45%) and national (28%) samples. Among oncology patients who could name DVT risk factors (n=155), 8% named surgery, 1% named cancer treatment. Among national respondents who could name DVT risk factors (n=109), significantly more (79%) said they could name DVT signs/symptoms compared to oncology respondents (63%) who said the same. While not statistically significant, the national sample did show greater recognition of certain DVT signs/symptoms: skin redness/discoloration, 41% national, 21% oncology; leg swelling, 50% national, 31% oncology; and, leg pain, 37% national, 27% oncology. PE awareness was low among both groups, with 15% of all oncology and 16% of all national respondents saying that they had heard of PE. Of those who what said they knew what a PE was (unaided) or identified it correctly from an aided checklist, about one-third of both groups said they could name PE signs/symptoms, with \u201cbreathing difficulties\u201d cited most frequently by oncology (69%) and national (73%) respondents. Significantly fewer oncology patients (28%) mentioned chest pain/tightness as a PE sign/symptom, compared to the national sample (57%). About 8 in 10 oncology and national respondents said that they did know what a blood clot is, and virtually all respondents (98%) recognized blood clots as life threatening. DVT/PE awareness/knowledge was low. Despite increased risk, oncology patients demonstrated no greater awareness of DVT/PE than the general public. DVT/PE education, utilizing interventions identified in the Surgeon General's DVT/PE CTA, should target the general public, with special emphasis on at-risk oncology patients to fill gaps relative to increased DVT/PE risks and signs/symptoms. Terms should be further simplified for future public awareness and patient education initiatives.
