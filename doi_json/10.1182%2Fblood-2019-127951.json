    "abstract_text": "Background: PF-114 is a 4 th -generation oral tyrosine kinase-inhibitor (TKI) active against wild-type and mutated BCR-ABL1 isoforms including BCR-ABL1 T315I . We present data from a phase-1 study in patients with chronic or accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) failing \u22652 TKIs or with BCR-ABL1 T315I (NCT02885766) with \u22656 months therapy. Methods: 3+3 dose-escalation study to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Secondary objectives included safety and efficacy based on haematological, cytogenetic, and molecular criteria. Adverse events (AEs) were graded using NCI-CTCAE v4.03. Results: 51 patients were enrolled. Daily doses were 50 mg (n=3), 100 mg (n=3), 200 mg (n=9), 300 mg (n=11), 400 mg (n=12), 500 mg (n=3), 600 mg (n=6), 750 mg (n=4) given continuously. Median age was 50 years (range, 29-82 years). Median CML duration pre-study was 10 years (range, 0.3-23 years). All patients had baseline ECOG performance scores 0-1. Twelve patients had BCR-ABL1 T315I . Patients were heavily pre-treated: 25 received \u22653 prior TKIs; 5 patients with BCR-ABL1 T315I received 1 prior TKI. Interim analysis was conducted at follow-up of \u22656 months (cut-off date January 16 th 2019). Therapy was ongoing in 17 patients at doses 200 mg (n=4), 300 mg (n=9), 400 mg (n=3) and 600 mg (n=1) with median duration of exposure of 7,4 (range, 4,6-26), 9,2 (range, 7,4-26), 9,2 (range, 8,3-9,2) and 9,2 months. Other patients discontinued because of progression (n=18), adverse events (n=6), consent withdrawal (n=4), participation in another study (n=3) or other reasons (n=3). The MTD was 600 mg with the grade-3 psoriasis-like skin lesions the DLT, which occurred during the first 28 days of treatment. Reversible grade-3 skin toxicity occurred in 11 patients at doses \u2265400 mg. There were no other drug-related non-hematologic grade-3 toxicities except 1 grade-3 toxic hepatitis at 400 mg and there were no detectable effects on ankle-brachial index or vascular occlusive events. The best safety/efficacy dose was 300 mg/d with 6 of 11 patients achieving a major cytogenetic response (MCyR) and 4 of them - a major molecular response (MMR). Higher doses were less effective probably because of toxicity-related therapy interruptions and discontinuations. Five of 12 patients with BCR-ABL1 T315I responded, 3 of which achieved a complete hematologic response and 4 achieved MCyR. Conclusion: PF-114 was safe and effective in patients with CML failing \u22652 TKIs or with BCR-ABL1 T315I . The most effective dose was 300 mg/d. Five of 12 patients with BCR-ABL1 T315I responded. A pivotal study is beginning.
