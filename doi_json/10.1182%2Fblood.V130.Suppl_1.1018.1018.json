    "abstract_text": "Sialylated derivatives of N-Acetyl Lactosamine (LacNAc) regulate platelet lifespan, hepatic thrombopoietin (TPO) production, and thus thrombopoiesis. A major enzyme that synthesizes LacNAc is \u03b21,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (\u03b24GalT1), the gene of which is highly conserved through evolution. Long considered a housekeeping gene, the transcriptional regulation of B 4GALT1 remained widely understudied, and recent observations have shown that itspromoter region is rich in enhancer sequences. Both TPO and the chemokine CXCL12 regulate thrombopoiesis. Here we report that TPO and CXCL12 regulate megakaryocyte (MK) function by increasing \u03b2 4galt1 transcription . TPO and CXCL12 induced a two-wave expression of LacNAc in MKs. TPO was required for LacNAc production in wild type (WT) MKs, and \u03b24GalT1 deletion in mice (\u03b24GalT1 -/- ) resulted in severe thrombocytopenia due to increased integrin activity in MKs, and defective MK localization within the bone marrow (BM). Detailed analysis of \u03b24GalT1 -/- MKs and platelets showed that \u03b24GalT1 -/- MKs are almost completely devoid of LacNAc expression. Complete lack of galactosyltransferase activity in \u03b24GalT1 -/- MKs and platelets was demonstrated using in vitro enzymatic assays, showing that LacNAc synthesis in MKs and platelets depends primarily on \u03b24GalT1. In WT MKs cultured in the presence of TPO alone, and in isolated circulating platelets, LacNAc expression was particularly evident in polypeptides with molecular weight ranging between 100-150 kDa, which were identified as \u03b1IIb\u03b23, GPIb\u03b1 and \u03b21 integrin. Addition of CXCL12 in vitro increased LacNAc expression specifically on a 130-kDa polypeptide, identified as the \u03b21 integrin subunit. Further detailed investigation of receptor expression and function showed that WT MKs expressed two \u03b21 integrin glycoforms of 130 and 100 kDa, and WT platelets expressed only the 130-kDa glycoform. \u03b24GalT1 -/- MKs and platelets expressed only the immature 100-kDa \u03b21 integrin glycoform. While the subcellular distribution \u03b21 integrin was indistinguishable between WT and \u03b24GalT1 -/- MKs and platelets, lack of LacNAc synthesis resulted in increased of \u03b21 integrin surface expression, as determined by flow cytometry. \u03b24GalT1 -/- platelet adhesion to collagen and laminin was significantly increased and was unaffected by addition of RGDS. By contrast, GPIb\u03b1 and \u03b1IIb\u03b23 expression and function were not affected by \u03b24GalT1 loss. Together, the results suggest that TPO and CXCL12 upregulate \u03b24GalT1-dependent LacNAc synthesis to promote thrombopoiesis, likely regulating MK \u03b21 integrin expression, glycosylation and subsequent interaction with components of the extracellular matrix. Investigating the mechanisms regulating posttranslational modifications induced by various hematopoietic stimulating chemokines and cytokines will contribute to better understand thrombopoiesis.
