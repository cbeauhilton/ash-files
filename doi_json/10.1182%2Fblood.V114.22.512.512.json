    "abstract_text": "Abstract 512 Delayed immune reconstitution following intensive T cell depletion of the stem cell graft is the main complication limiting broad utilization of haplo-mismatched donors for stem cell transplantion (SCT). Indeed, it results in frequent and rapidly lethal infectious events. The ability to accelerate immune reconstitution following haplo-SCT would provide a unique opportunity to transplant the large number of patients who cannot find an HLA-matched donor. We present results of our Phase I clinical trial of haploidentical allogeneic SCT followed by an \u201cadd-back of donor T cells to accelerate immune reconstitution\u201d (ATIR). This donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) underwent photodynamic depletion (PD) of host-reactive T cells using dibromorhodamine as photosensitizer (Kiadis Pharma). Nineteen patients (11 M, 8 F) with very high-risk hematologic malignancies (mostly refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (10) and myelodysplastic syndromes (4), and refractory ALL (1), CLL (2), CML (1) and NHL (1)) entered the trial. Median age at SCT was 54 years (range: 19-62). HLA compatibility was 3/6 in 6 pts, 4/6 in 12 pts and 5/6 (DR mismatch) in 1 pt. Increasing doses of PD-treated donor cells (ATIR: 1\u00d710 4 to 5.0 \u00d710 6 CD3+ cells/kg) were administered on day 34\u00b16 after transplant. In the ATIR, greater than 95% of CD4+CD25+ and CD8+CD25+ T cells as well as anti-host cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors (CTLp) were depleted from DLIs. All stem cell grafts underwent in vitro immunomagnetic T cell depletion using CD34+ positive cell selection (Miltenyi). The myeloablative regimen consisted of TBI (1200 cGy), thiotepa (5 mg/kg) and fludarabine (200 mg/m2). No GVHD prophylaxis was administered. All patients showed complete donor chimerism and durable hematologic engraftment. Five patients developed grade II GVHD affecting skin (n = 5 pts), liver (2 pts) and gastrointestinal tract (1 pt) at a median of 101 days post-SCT. No patient developed grade III-IV acute GVHD. Chronic GVHD developed in 9 pts, mostly in those receiving higher T cell doses. Treatment of acute and chronic GVHD involved steroids, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil in 3 patients, steroids and tacrolimus in 3 pts, and steroids only in 3 pts. GVHD responded rapidly to treatment since the median duration of total immunosuppressive therapy in each patient was 187 days (range: 61-319 d). All 7 patients in cohorts 1-3, who received 1.3\u00d710 5 or less CD3+ cells/kg, developed infectious complications (100% of pts), with 5 lethal episodes in these 7 pts. In sharp contrast, only 6 (50%) of the following 12 patients (cohorts 4-7) receiving ATIR with the highest CD3+ cell doses (3.2\u00d710 5 to 5.0\u00d710 6 CD3+ cells/kg) developed infections (p <0.05), none resulting in a fatal event (p<0.001). Interestingly, CD3 lymphocytes recovered earlier in the last 2 cohorts (6 and 7) receiving 2-5\u00d710 6 CD3+ cells/kg than in the first 5 cohorts (7.9\u00d710 5 or less CD3+ cells/kg) (p<0.01). Eight patients died: 4 of relapsed leukemia (3 AML; 1 ALL) and 4 of infections. Overall treatment related mortality (TRM) is 27% at 2 years post-SCT, with a TRM of 0% in patients receiving the highest CD3+ cell doses (cohorts 4-7). The overall survival is 60% at 2 years (median f-up: 12.1 mo; 95% confidence interval at 2 years: 37-83%). The 12 patients in cohorts 4-7 receiving the higher CD3+ cell doses had an improved survival (82% at 2 yrs) over the 7 patients in cohorts 1-3 administered a lower CD3+ cell dose (14% at 2 yrs) (p<0.05). Our results indicate that the post-transplant infusion of an ATIR-PD treated DLI is feasible, results in accelerated T cell reconstitution, and decreases the incidence and severity of infections without inducing severe GVHD. These results suggest a clinical benefit for patients receiving the highest ATIR doses and form the basis of an international pivotal clinical trial to decrease TRM in patients undergoing haploidentical stem cell transplantation.
