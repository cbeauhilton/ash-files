    "abstract_text": "Abstract 711 Nai\u0308ve CD4 T cells differentiate into diverse effector and regulatory subsets to coordinate the adaptive immune response. T H 1 and T H 2 effector subsets produce IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4, respectively, whereas proinflammatory T H 17 cells are key regulators of autoimmune inflammation, characteristically produce IL-17 and IL-22 and differentiate in the presence of inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and IL-21 together with TGF-\u03b2. Naive T cells can also differentiate into tissue-protective induced T regulatory (iT reg ) cells. NFAT proteins are highly phosphorylated and reside in the cytoplasm of resting cells. Upon dephosphorylation by the Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent serine phosphatase calcineurin, NFAT proteins translocate to the nucleus, where they orchestrate developmental and activation programs in diverse cell types. In this study, we investigated the role of the Ca/NFAT signaling pathway in regulating T cell differentiation and the development of autoimmune diseases. We generated transgenic mice conditionally expressing a hyperactivable version of NFAT1 (AV-NFAT1) from the ROSA26 locus. To restrict AV-NFAT1 expression to the T cell compartment, ROSA26-AV-NFAT1 transgenic mice were bred to CD4-Cre transgenic mice. Nai\u0308ve CD4 T cells freshly isolated from AV mice produced significantly less IL-2 but increased amounts of the inhibitory cytokine IL-10. To investigate the role of NFAT1 in the generation of T H 1, T H 2, T reg and T H 17 cells, the respective cell types were generated from CD4 T cells of AV mice by in vitro differentiation. T cells from AV-NFAT1 mice exhibited a dysregulation of cytokine expression, producing more IFN-\u03b3 and less IL-4. While the numbers of CD4+CD25+ \u201cnatural\u201d T reg cells in peripheral lymphoid organs and their in vitro suppressive functions were slightly decreased in AV mice, iT reg generation from CD4+CD25- T cells of AV mice as compared to wild type cells was markedly enhanced. Moreover, T H 17 cells generated in vitro from CD4 T cells of AV mice in the presence of IL-6, IL-21 and TGF-\u03b2 exhibited dramatically increased expression of both IL-10 and IL-17 as compared to wild type controls. To investigate putative NFAT binding sites in the IL-10 and IL-17 gene loci, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. We show that NFAT1 can bind at the IL-17 locus at 3 out of 9 CNS regions which are accessible specifically during T H 17 but not during T H 1 and T H 2 differentiation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that NFAT1 binds one CNS region in the IL10-locus in T H 17 cells. To verify our observations in vivo, we induced experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) in AV mice and wild type controls with the immunodominant myelin antigen MOG33-55 emulsified in complete Freund\u2018s adjuvant. While wild type animals showed a normal course of disease with development of tail and hind limb paralysis after approximately 10 days, AV mice showed a markedly weaker disease phenotype with less severe degrees of paralysis and accelerated kinetics of remission. Moreover at the peak of the response, there were fewer CD4+CD25- but more CD4+CD25+ T cells in the CNS of AV animals compared to wild type controls. Surprisingly, these cells produced significantly more IL-2, IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3 upon restimulation, even though they displayed decreased disease. In summary, our data provide strong evidence that NFAT1 contributes to the regulation of IL-10 and IL-17 expression in T H 17 cells and show that increasing NFAT1 activity can ameliorate autoimmune encephalitis. This could occur in part through upregulation of IL-10 expression as observed in vitro, but is also likely to reflect increased infiltration of regulatory T cells into the CNS as well as increased conversion of conventional T cells into Foxp3+ regulatory T cells within the CNS.
