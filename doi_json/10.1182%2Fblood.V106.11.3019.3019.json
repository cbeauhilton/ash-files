    "abstract_text": "Heparin is used during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery in children. Upon exposure to heparin, heparin-dependent platelet antibodies (HDPA) may form against complexes of platelet factor 4 and heparin on platelet surfaces. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT) may then ensue. Among adult CPB patients, up to 50% demonstrate HDPA, although only 2% develop HIT and 1% develop HITT. In previous studies done among non-CPB newborns and pediatric intensive care patients, the incidence of HDPA has been zero to minimal. Objective: To determine prevalence of HDPA among children undergoing CPB who are exposed to unfractionated heparin for >120 hours after CPB. Methods: We designed a prospective pilot study. All patients \u2264 12 years old who were to receive heparin during CPB were eligible. The presence of HDPA was assessed by heparin-platelet factor 4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); positive and equivocal results were confirmed by serotonin release assay. Blood samples were obtained at the time of cessation of heparin or after 10 days on heparin, whichever came first. Results: Thirty patients were enrolled: 15 were aged 2\u201319 days (median 6 days); 15 were aged 1.2 to 50 months (median 4.5 months). One patient had borderline positive and 1 had positive results by heparin-platelet factor 4 ELISA; both had negative results by serotonin release assay; neither developed clots. Eighteen patients developed thrombocytopenia, which is common after CPB, including the 2 with equivocal results by ELISA. Six patients, all with negative ELISAs, developed symptomatic thromboses. Conclusion: There were no HDPA identified among children who received unfractionated heparin for CPB. The specificity of heparin-platelet factor 4 ELISA among children should be assessed.",
