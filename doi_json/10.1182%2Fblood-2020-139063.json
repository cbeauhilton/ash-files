    "abstract_text": "Background The optimal dose of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) with respect to the prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) is under investigation. In our previous single-center randomized study, as compared with 6 mg/kg ATG, 10 mg/kg ATG was found to be associated with better GVHD prevention and superior GRFS, but an increase in infection-related deaths. Later on, in our multi-center randomized trial, 7.5 mg/kg ATG for GVHD prophylaxis was associated with reduced EBV and CMV infections without increased incidence of GVHD in comparison with 10.0 mg/kg ATG in haplo-HSCT. Methods We reanalyzed and updated the prospective, randomized trial (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01883180) identifying the influence of 7.5mg/kg versus 10.0 mg/kg of ATG on clinical outcomes in haplo-HSCT with extended follow-up (N=145. Seventy-six patients received 7.5 mg/kg ATG (ATG-7.5), whereas the remaining patients received 10 mg/kg ATG (ATG-10). Results The median follow-up period was 1702 days (range, 23-2036 days). The rate of infection-related deaths in ATG-10 arm was double that of the ATG-7.5 arm (20.0% vs 11.8%; P=0.024). The 5 year cumulative incidence of relapse was not significantly different between the ATG-7.5 and ATG-10 groups (16.8% vs. 5.7%, P = 0.053). The 5 year cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was comparable between the ATG-7.5 and ATG-10 groups (27.6% vs. 28.7%, P = 0.938). The 5 year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD (46.7% vs. 48.3%, P = 0.913), moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD (32.8% vs. 25.3%, P = 0.248), and severe chronic GVHD (17.1% vs. 13.3%, P = 0.505) were comparable between the ATG-7.5 and ATG-10 groups. The 5 year probabilities of disease-free survival (DFS) in the ATG-7.5 and ATG-10 groups were 55.6% and 65.7%, respectively (P = 0.281). The 5 year probability of GVHD-free/relapse-free survival (GRFS) in the ATG-10 group was significantly higher than that in the ATG-7.5 group (48.1% vs. 29.5%, P = 0.020). The 5 year cumulative incidence of late effects of grades 1-5 (67.2% vs. 71.2%, P = 0.695) and multiple late effects (26.2% vs. 25.4%, P = 0.920) were comparable between the ATG-7.5 and ATG-10 groups. In multivariate analysis, ATG-7.5 was associated with a significantly lower GRFS compared to ATG-10 (hazard ratio, 1.819; 95% confidence interval, 1.106-2.994; p=0.019). Conclusion it appears that 10 mg/kg ATG was found to be associated with superior GRFS and comparable GVHD and late effects, but an increase in infection-related deaths as compared with 7.5 mg/kg ATG for haplo-HSCT.
