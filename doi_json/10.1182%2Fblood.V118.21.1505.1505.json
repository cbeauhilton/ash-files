    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1505 Asparaginase is an essential component of combination chemotherapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Asparaginase breaks down asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonia. Because asparagine is necessary for protein synthesis, its depletion leads to cell death. Recently, it has been suggested that mesenchymal cells in the bone marrow may produce asparagine and form \u2018protective niches\u2019 for leukemic cells. In vitro , this led to high levels of asparagine and asparaginase resistance of the ALL cells (Iwamoto et al. (J Clin Invest. 2007)). However, it is unknown if this holds true for the clinical in vivo situation. The aim of our study is to analyse whether mesenchymal cells or other cells in the bone marrow indeed produce significant amounts of asparagine in vivo that may lead to clinical asparaginase resistance. Ten de novo ALL patients were enrolled in this study. All children received induction chemotherapy according to protocol 1-A and 1-B of the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG) ALL-10 protocol. Asparaginase levels and amino acid levels (asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamine and glutamic acid) were measured in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood at diagnosis (day 1), days 15, 33 and 79. On days that asparaginase was administered (days 15 and 33) it was ensured that study material was obtained before the E-coli L-asparaginase infusions. Changes over time of asparaginase trough levels in BM and peripheral blood were evaluated using Mixed models ANOVA. The amino acids levels in 0.5 ml BM, 3 ml BM and peripheral blood at days 15 and 33 were also compared using Mixed models ANOVA. All these analyses were done after log transformation of measured values to get approximate normal distributions. A two-sided p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The asparaginase levels were all below detection limit (< 5 IU/L) in BM and peripheral blood at days 1 and 79. In both compartments, the median asparaginase trough levels were not significantly different at days 15 and 33. At diagnosis, no significant difference in asparagine level between 3 ml BM and peripheral blood was found (median: 44.5 \u03bcM (range 20.6\u201359.6 \u03bcM) and 43.9 \u03bcM (range 18.4 \u201358.5 \u03bcM), respectively). However, the median level of aspartic acid at diagnosis in 3 ml BM (19.2 \u03bcM; range 6.2\u201352.6 \u03bcM) was significantly higher as compared to median level of peripheral blood (5.7 \u03bcM; range 2.4\u201310.1 \u03bcM) (p=0.002). The aspartic acid levels were also higher in BM compared to peripheral blood at days 15 and 33 (both p=0.001) and at day 79 (p=0.002). Aspartic acid levels were significantly higher in 0.5 ml versus 3 ml BM (p=0.001) and this difference was also found when comparing 0.5 ml BM versus peripheral blood (p<0.001) suggesting dilution with peripheral blood when taking higher volumes of \u2018bone marrow\u2019. Asparagine levels were all below the lower limit of quantification (LLQ < 0.2 \u03bcM) in both BM and blood during asparaginase treatment at days 15 and 33. At day 79, no significant difference in asparagine levels between BM (37.7 \u03bcM; range 33.4\u201350.3 \u03bcM) and peripheral blood (38.9 \u03bcM; range 25.7 \u201351.3 \u03bcM) was seen. During the time course of asparaginase infusions, the glutamine and glutamic acid levels did not change significantly. In conclusion, we demonstrate higher aspartic acid levels in bone marrow compared to peripheral blood. The higher aspartic acid levels are detected at diagnosis, during asparaginase therapy at days 15 and 33, and also at day 79 at complete remission, showing that these do not originate from leukemic cells nor from asparagine breakdown by asparaginase but from cells in the microenvironment of the bone marrow. However, there is no increased asparagine synthesis in vivo in the bone marrow of ALL patients. Therefore, increased asparagine synthesis by mesenchymal cells may be of relevance for resistance to asparaginase of leukemic cells in vitro but not in vivo .
