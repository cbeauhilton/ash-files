    "abstract_text": "Objective The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders, while, immunological abnormalities are frequently observed in patients with MDS. Several reports revealed that about 10% of MDS patients have clinical autoimmune disorders like skin vasculitis, rheumatic disease, or autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Furthermore, serological immunological abnormalities like hyper- or hypogammaglobulinemia, positivities of antinuclear antibody, positivities of direct Coombs test, or inverted CD4/8 ratios were found in 18\u201365% of patients with MDS. Recently immunosuppressive therapies including prednisolone, antithymocyte globulin, and cyclosporin A (CsA) are used to treat cytopenia in some patients with MDS. But it isn\u2019t very clear the immunosuppressive mechanism in MDS and the value of the treatment. To analyze the content of signal joint Tcell receptor excision DNA circles signal joint T cell receptor excision DNA circles(sjTRECs) within peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), thereby to infer the level of naive T cells and the recent thymic output function in patients with myelodyspoastic syndrom. Methods Quantitative detection of sjTRECs in DNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 13 normal individuals and 8 patienets were performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and TaqMan technique. Results The median value of sjTRECs copies P1 000 PBMCs was 4.37\u00b13.64 in normal individuals whereas it was1.07 \u00b11.40 copies P1 000 PBMCs in myelodysplastic syndrom patients ( P <0. 05). Conclusions MDS Patients decrease in recent thymic output function.",
