    "abstract_text": "Establishing clearly defined, accurate reference ranges facilitates good interpretation and effective discrimination between health and disease. These can be used to obviate the need for unnecessary follow-up medical examinations thereby reducing costs. Our data represent findings from one of the most comprehensive studies ever undertaken with the XE-2100 to establish reference ranges (RRs) in healthy adults. Early morning venous samples were collected into Greiner EDTA Vacuettes (Ref: 454286) from 221 healthy laboratory personnel (F= 159;M = 62) aged 20\u201363 yrs for both gender. Age groups were equally represented. Samples were processed on a Sysmex XE-2100 analyser within 1 hour of collection. NCCLS guidelines (C28-A and H3-A4) were followed throughout. Outliers were excluded, data examined for normal distribution from histograms, Q-Q normality plots, skewness and kurtosis and significance levels calculated from the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests of normality. RRs for near normally distributed parameters were calculated using means \u00b1 2SDs. RRs for non-normally distributed parameters were calculated using the log natural transformation and the antilog of the 2.5- and 97.5- percentiles. Bold parameters shown below have near-normal distribution. Non emboldened values are non-normally distributed. P values are derived from Mann-Whitney U test for differences between males and females.  . New Limits . Historical Limits . Test of M&F diff. (P value) *=sig. diff. .

However, leucocyte counts are at their lowest in the early morning. Our findings are in general agreement with previously published data from more limited trials undertaken in other countries.",
