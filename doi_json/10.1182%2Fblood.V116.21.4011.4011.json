    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4011 Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a highly heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and a predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia, where a model of multisteponcogenesis has been implicated in their pathogenesis. On the other hand, recent advances in cancer genome analysis disclosed a number of gene mutations involved in the development of MDS, including mutations of RAS, RUNX1, CEBPA, TET2, CBL , EZH2 and TP53 , where multiple gene mutations frequently harbor in a single case. However, the entire profiles of these multiple gene mutations with their relationship with WHO classification, chromosomal alterations, and clinical pictures have not been explored in a large series of MDS cases. Screening possible gene mutations in dozens of candidate genes in a large number of samples using Sanger sequencing were a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. So in order to overcome this issue and to obtain comprehensive registries of gene mutations in known candidate genes in a total of 170 cases with MDS and related disorders, we performed high throughput mutation analyses of more than 80 candidate genes using Genome Solexa-based next-generation resequencing technology combined with target gene capture and barcode labeling of individual samples. Briefly, each fragmented genomic DNA was frist amplified by single-primer polymerase-chain reactions (PCR), from which target sequences were concentrated using the SureSelect-system\u00ae (Agilent). Captured targets were primed with 6-base barcode sequences to discriminate the sample, which were subjected to high-thoughput resequencing using Genome Analizer\u00ae(Illumina). All 170 cases were already analyzed by Affymetrix SNP arrays, and their mutation status regarding RUNX1, p53, NRAS and KRAS, c-CBL and TET2 had been determined by Sanger sequencing, and thus were considered to an ideal sample set for this study, in which genome-wide copy numbers were characterized in detail and the known mutations works as a control to measure the performance of the barcode resequencing. Targeted 80 genes consisted of exons with total length of \u223c500Kb, and included genes which were known to be mutated in MDS and related disorders, and other candidate targets of mutations. We were able to analyze up to 80 samples per 1 run and efficiently detected mutations in targeted genes by the high average coverage obtained from these sequences. On average 80% of targeted regions were covered with >20 depths of reading. In this meeting, we will present the result of our large-scale mutation study in MDS and related disorders and discuss the genetic basis of MDS in terms of multiple gene mutations as well as copy number alterations.
