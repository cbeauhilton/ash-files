    "abstract_text": "We and others previously reported that leukemic CLL cells spontaneously secrete VEGF and that VEGF can enhance the leukemic B cell apoptosis resistance via unknown mechanisms. Here, we report elevated VEGF secretion is associated with CLL B cell over-expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1), a transcription factor that is a key regulator of VEGF synthesis. Immunostaining analysis confirmed CLL B cells in blood and bone marrow over-expressed both HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF. The high HIF-1\u03b1 levels were not linked to proline residue (402/564) mutations in oxygen dependent degradation domains; absence of proline hydroxylation dependent enzymes (PHD1, 2, 3, and FIH); or to pVHL mutation (exon 1, 2 and 3); or aberrant transcription of HIF-1\u03b1. However, pVHL, a regulator of HIF-1\u03b1 degradation, was found to be lower in CLL B cells and unable to physically interact with HIF-1\u03b1 in CLL B cells. Nuclear extraction assay revealed that HIF-1\u03b1 interacted with its co-factor, p300/CRP in B cells, indicating that HIF-1\u03b1 was transcriptionally active. We hypothesized that reduction of pVHL expression in CLL B cells could be related to repression by micro RNA function which is known to be aberrantly expressed in CLL. We focused on miR-92-1 known to be over-expressed in CLL B cells and it has pVHL as a putative target. In a luciferase assay of transfected human megakaryocytic cell line, MEG-01, we found a direct effect for miR-92-1 on pVHL, with significant repression of luciferase activity of VHL expression by miR-92-1 compared to both control vectors and a mutated target mRNA sequences. This result indicated that wild-type miR-92-1 was able to interact directly with the 3\u2032 UTR sequence of pVHL and subsequently repress pVHL expression. To further confirm this finding, we did transient transfections of either the CLL cell line Mec-1, primary CLL B cells or normal B cells with a sense oligo miR-92-1 (both Mec-1 and CLL B cells) or wild-type miR-92-1 plasmid (normal B cells). We found the level of flow detectable pVHL lower when compared to non-transfected cells. Because we were interested in the relationship of HIF-1\u03b1 to CLL B cell survival we studied if chemotherapeutic drugs can downregulate HIF-1\u03b1 in CLL B cells. To do this we studied flavopiridol a drug that has very promising activity in CLL. Our results indicated that flavopiridol does down-regulate HIF-1\u03b1 levels in CLL B cells. This latter change was associated with induction of apoptosis in CLL B cells. Overall, our data show that elevated VEGF secretion is related to constitutively elevated HIF-1\u03b1 levels and is an explanation for the VEGF-based autocrine pathway found in CLL B cells. We also show that elevated HIF-1\u03b1 levels could be partially related to depressed pVHL with a unique mechanism for its repression: the over-expressed microRNA, miR-92-1 in CLL-B cells.",
