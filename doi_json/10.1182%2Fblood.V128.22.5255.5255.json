    "abstract_text": "Objectives: In the present study, we investigated the relation between genetic mutations and complete remission (CR) in 78 leukemia patients treated with demethylation drug. Methods: One hundred and eleven leukemia-related genes were sequenced by ultra-deep targeted sequencing. Among these, 52 genes were found to be mutated, such as DNMT3A , TET2 , IDH1 , IDH2 , etc., hotspot genes of demethylation drug treatment. Results: No DNMT3A nor TET2 mutations were found in 17 patients without significant remission after demethylation drug treatment, while 18% (11/61) patients with complete remission after demethylation drug treatment harbored DNMT3A mutations, and 10% (6/61) patients achieving complete remission after demethylation drug treatment harbored TET2 mutations. The difference was statistically significant when compared with non-mutant group (P<0.05). Conclusions: Our study indicated a significant association between mutations of DNMT3A and TET2 and efficacyof demethylation drug-treated leukemia patients. Complete remission after demethylation drug treatment was achieved more frequently in the cohort harboring mutated DNMT3A or TET2 , which is consistent with previous studies. Our findings suggest ultra-deep targeted sequencing is helpful for investigating the relation between mutated genes and the efficacy of drug. Moreover, it could be a way for screening more suitable patients for demethylation drug treatment in consideration of its extremely high expense.
