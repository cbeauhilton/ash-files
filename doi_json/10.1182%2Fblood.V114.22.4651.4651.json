    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4651 Introduction Graft versus host disease remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity following matched unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Campath-1H (Alemtuzumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody to CD52, an antigen expressed on T and B lymphocytes, monocytes and natural killer cells and is thought to reduce GVHD incidence through in vivo T cell depletion. Through the same mechanism it can potentially increase the risk of relapse by reducing the graft vs. leukemia effect and also possibly increase the risk of infection due to delayed immune recovery. This study looks at our experience with Campath-1H substituted in place of the conventional anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) in our transplant conditioning regimen. Patients and Methods This retrospective case study included 17 pediatric (9 male; 8 female) matched unrelated bone marrow transplants done in our institution between January 2003 and June 2009 with Campath-1H as part of the pretransplant conditioning regimen. The primary transplant indication was leukemia/lymphoma (n=9), MDS/ MDS evolving into AML (n= 3), severe aplastic anemia (n=4) and Fanconi anemia (n=1). The conditioning regimen included Campath-1H given with cytoxan/ total body irradiation (TBI) in 14 patients, fludarabine/ TBI in 2 patients, and melphalan/ fludarabine in 1 patient. Campath-1H dosing was body weight based: 3mg (if between 5-15kg), 5 mg (if between 16-30kg) and 10 mg (if >30 kg) and 3 doses were administered when underlying condition was a malignancy and 4 doses when it was a bone marrow failure state. The last dose was given at least 24 hours prior to the bone marrow/ peripheral stem cell infusion. GVHD prophylaxis was with tacrolimus/methotrexate (n=12), tacrolimus (n=4) and cyclosporine/methotrexate (n=1). Standard institutional infectious prophylaxis was followed. Results The median age at transplant was 12.2 years (range; 0.7-19.7 years). All but one patient engrafted with a median of 21 days (range; 14-25 days). 5 out of 17 developed Grade I-II acute GVHD which resolved with steroids. No patient developed chronic GVHD. One patient had a CMV reactivation but no patient developed active CMV disease. 4 patients had varicella one of whom died of disseminated infection (day +376). The same patient also had adeno viral infection and BK viremia. 1 patient developed PCP pneumonia and retinal toxoplasmosis. 5 patients (6 transplants) relapsed (range; 40-641 days) with 3 relapsing within +100 days. 1 patient developed PTLD which was successfully treated with rituximab. Of the 4 patient deaths 3 were due to relapse and one due to disseminated varicella infection. The median follow-up time was 719 days (range; 147-2175 days). Overall survival as calculated using the Kaplan-Meir analysis was 100 % at 100 days and 94% at 1 year. Event free survival censoring for death, relapse and rejection was 76% at 100 days and 64% at 1 year. Conclusions Based on our experience, Campath-1H used as part of pretransplant conditioning regimen in pediatric matched unrelated transplants seems to reduce the risk of serious GVHD. This is in concordance with other published literature. T cell depletion is considered to increase the risk of life threatening infections. Our study had one infection related death. There were no patients with active CMV disease. This may in part be attributed to strict prophylactic measures and increased surveillance. Longer duration of follow-up is required to adequately analyze the relapse rates. Also, given our small patient numbers the effect of primary disease state and stage on relapse could not be assessed. Larger studies in the pediatric population with longer duration of follow-up comparing Campath-1H with conventional regimens are required to further assess its role with regards to graft vs. leukemia effect and also to establish if the decreased incidence of GVHD is sustained in larger cohorts.
