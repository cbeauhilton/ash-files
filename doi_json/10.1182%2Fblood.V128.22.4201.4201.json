    "abstract_text": "Background : Survival of DLBCL patients with high IPI treated with RCHOP immunochemotherapy is poor. In this population, the combination of RCHOP with new drugs is an attractive approach, along with performing an evaluation with PET/CT after 2 to 4 cycles to change the therapy if an early complete response is not achieved. Methods : We performed a clinical trial comparing 6 cycles of RCHOP vs 6 cycles of BRCAP, a modified RCHOP regimen changing vincristine by bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 sc days 1, 8, and 15 of a 21-day cycle. Pre-phase therapy was permitted for patients who could not wait the results of the screening procedures to start therapy due to the aggressiveness of the disease. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01848132). Patients younger than 71 yrs diagnosed with DLBCL and an age-adjusted IPI (aaIPI) 2-3 or aaIPI 1 with increased beta2microglobulin were eligible. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who survives free of event at 2 years. Centralized anatomopathology review was performed in all cases; samples were classified as germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) vs non-GCB subtypes by immunohistochemistry according to the Hans algorithm. PET/CTs were performed baseline, after 2, 4 and 6 cycles (PET2, PET4, and PET6), and were reviewed at real time by at least 3 experts of a central panel. Response at the end of therapy was analyzed following the visual method with the Deauville scale, and response after PET2 and PET4 was evaluated using the semiquantitative method. Persistent disease at PET4 was considered as failure of therapy and these patients were removed from trial treatment. EFS was calculated from diagnosis until event defined as death from any cause, relapse, progression or need of salvage therapy (defined as PET4 or PET6 positive). Overall survival (OS) was calculated from diagnosis until death for any cause. We present here a preliminary analysis of results. Results: One hundred and twenty-one patients were included; data on 113 are presented (diagnosis not confirmed in 6, data missing in 2). Median age was 57.1 yrs (range 23-70), 57 (50.4%) were males. Characteristics at diagnosis were: non-GCB subtype 32/87 (36.8%), immunohistochemical co-expression of myc/bcl2 56/82 (77.8%), stage III-IV 107 (94.7%), \u22652 extranodal locations 55/76 (72.5%), ECOG 2-3 36 (32.1%), increased LDH 88 (77.9%), increased beta 2 microglobulin 73 (64.6%), aaIPI 3: 32 (28.3%). No differences were found between treatment arms. Fifty-five patients were treated in the experimental arm (EA) and 58 in the control arm (CA). Twenty-eight (28.3%) out of 99 patients required of pre-phase treatment. The mean relative dose intensity for bortezomib was 88.3%. Data about the most frequent toxicity are shown in table 1. Twenty-nine (30.2%) out of 96 patients who have finished 4 cycles had a positive PET4 according to central review and were withdrawn to receive salvage therapy. Complete remission (CR) at the end of therapy (PET4-/PET6-) was observed in 44 (45.8%) patients. After a median follow-up of 9 months, estimated 12-mo EFS was 36.6%, and 12-mo OS was 82.9% in the whole series. Data of the subgroup analysis according the immunohistochemistry subtypes by Hans algorithm are show in table 2. Conclusions: In the present preliminary analysis, no significant differences were found between RCHOP and BRCAP in terms of CR and EFS in this very high-risk population of young DLBCL patients. However, in the subgroup analysis of patients with non-GCB disease, we found a significantly better CR rate in patients treated with BRCAP. A longer follow-up is needed to evaluate the real impact of this therapy on survival.
