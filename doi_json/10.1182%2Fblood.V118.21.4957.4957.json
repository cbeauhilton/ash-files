    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4957 Background Over 40% of patients with the most common lymphoid malignancy worldwide, DLBL, are over the age of 70. Although R-CHOP is inarguably the mainstay of therapy for DLBL patients, a significant number of elderly patients do not tolerate the regimen due to underlying frailty and/or co-morbidities. Most elderly patients with significant co-morbidities have limited treatment options and are not offered anthracycline-containing chemotherapy due to concerns regarding toxicity. Here we describe our single center experience with CEEP, a lower intensity regimen for elderly patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed DLBL whom are deemed inappropriate for CHOP-based chemotherapy. Method All patients >70 years old (median 78.5, range 71 \u2013 85) with histologically proven DLBL treated with CEEP \u00b1 Rituximab (R) at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital from 2000 to 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Modified CEEP, Cyclophosphamide 300mg/m2 Day 1 (D1) and D15, Epirubicin 50mg/m2 D1 and D15, Etoposide 100mg/m2 D1 and D15, and Prednisolone 50mg D1-D5 (reduced dose from original CEEP protocol) was administered every 2 weeks. Rituximab 375mg/m2 (when approved for use in Australia) was administered every 28 days. As per institutional protocol, all patients received Bactrim prophylaxis for Pneumocystis. Baseline characteristics, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Revised International Prognostic Index (RIPI), the number of CEEP cycles, treatment response and toxicity from treatment were identified and reviewed. Results A total of 22 patients were identified, 10 were male. 15 received CEEP as initial therapy, and 7 for relapsed disease. 23% (n=5) had an ECOG score \u2265 2. 55% (n=12) had RIPI \u2265 3. All patients had a Charlson Comorbidity Index \u2265 2, with 23% (n=5) \u2265 5, which was considered sufficient to preclude conventional CHOP-based chemotherapy. Median cardiac ejection fraction was 62% (range 55 \u2013 85%). 73% (n=16) received Rituximab and 50% (n=11) received primary GCSF prophylaxis. The median number of CEEP \u00b1 R cycles was 6 (range 2 \u2013 9 cycles). 5% (n=1) required dose reduction and 9% (n=2) required delays in treatment due to haematological toxicity. Median follow-up was 10.0 months (range 1 \u2013 92.7 months). At completion of therapy, complete responses (CR) were demonstrated in 10 patients (45%), with partial responses (PR) seen in 32% (n=7). 18% (n=4) demonstrated progressive disease (PD) despite therapy. Of the 7 patients with relapsed disease prior to CEEP \u00b1 R, CR was seen in 2 cases, both of whom had previous exposure to R-CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone) chemotherapy. At most recent follow up, 32% (n=7) have remained in CR with a median follow up period of 28.1 months (range 13 \u2013 92.7 months), 36% (n=8) had disease progression, 9% (n=2) demonstrated stable residual disease, while 23% (n=5) have died. Of the 5 deaths, 3 were attributed to progressive DLBL. The other deaths were a result of complications following further salvage chemotherapy. Grade 3 \u2013 4 haematological toxicity was observed in 72% (n=16) of patients. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 41% (n=9). Overall, 50% (n=11) required at least one re-admission to hospital. Non-haematological grade 3 \u2013 4 toxicity was detected in 2 patients, one of whom suffered unstable angina in the setting of anaemia, the other an acute cerebrovascular event in the setting of new atrial flutter post-chemotherapy. Discussion Although limited by a small sample size, our retrospective single center experience demonstrates that CEEP \u00b1 R chemotherapy can be administered to elderly patients with significant co-morbidities. Our cohort was all aged >70, with medical co-morbidities leading to the unsuitability of conventional CHOP-based therapy. Whilst an overall response rate of 77% (CR + PR) was observed, on prolonged follow up, 32% of patients remained in CR. Significant haematological toxicity (72%) and infectious complications (41%) were observed, however no deaths were directly attributed to the chemotherapy. Future prospective studies are required to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of R-CEEP in the elderly. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
