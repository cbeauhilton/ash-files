    "abstract_text": "Dr. Cigall Kadoch will discuss how recent exome-and genome-wide sequencing studies in human cancers have unmasked a striking frequency of mutations in the genes encoding subunits of the mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF) family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes. Her laboratory uses biochemistry, structural biology, systems biology, and genomics-based approaches to define the mechanisms of chromatin and gene regulation carried out by the mSWI/SNF family of chromatin regulators. Specifically, they have studied rare, genetically well-defined pediatric cancers including synovial sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, malignant rhabdoid tumor and others, all of which involve mSWI/SNF complex perturbations as critical drivers of their oncogenic programs. These studies have informed the diverse mechanisms underlying mSWI/SNF complex targeting and function in a wide array of cancers (including hematologic cancers) and developmental disorders and have provided new foundations for therapeutic development.
