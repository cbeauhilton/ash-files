    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4785 Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM) is a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by bone marrow infiltration of CD19 + cells and production of a monoclonal IgM protein. Despite advances in treatment, WM remains incurable. As part of these efforts we sought to define the role of HDAC-inhibitors in WM. Gene expression profiling of bone marrow CD19 + cells from 30 WM patients and 10 healthy donors showed over-expression of HDAC4, HDAC9, and Sirt5 in WM patients. Evaluation of the HDAC inhibitors suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA or Vorinostat), Trichostatin A (TSA), LBH-589 (Panobinostat), and sirtinol demonstrated dose dependent killing of BCWM.1 cells with IC 50 of 3.5 uM, 70 nM, 0.8 uM, and 30 uM, respectively, whilst the combination of these agents with bortezomib resulted in at least additive tumor cell killing. TSA is more potent than bortezomib in inducing apoptosis in primary WM tumor cells in patients with prior treatment. TSA and bortezomib showed synergistic effect in 25% of the patients samples tested. We also observed that TSA and bortezomib-induced apoptosis of BCWM.1 cells depended on the activation of a similar set of caspases. Conversely, changes in cell cycle regulators were distinctly different between TSA and bortezomib treated BCWM.1 cells. The results of these studies demonstrate over-expression of distinct members of HDAC in WM cells, and provide a framework for the examination of HDAC-inhibitors as monotherapy, as well as combination therapy with bortezomib in the treatment of WM.
