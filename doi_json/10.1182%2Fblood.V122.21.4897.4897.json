    "abstract_text": "Introduction Mutations in JAK2 have been implicated in polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ES), primary myelofibrosis (PMF) as wll as other myeloproliferative disorders. Aim In this study we aimed to investigate the frequency of JAK2V617F mutation on 216 patients with hematologic malignancies in childhood and 176 patients with myeloproliferative disorders in adulthood. Materials and method Patient group consist of 164 ALL and 52 AML patients in childhood and 79 PV, 51 ES, 22 chronic myeloid leukemia patients (CML) and 24 PMF patients in adulthood. These patients followed by Cukurova University, Departments of Pediatric and Adult Hematology, are included in this study. Blood samples were collected in these patients group and DNA was isolated using high pure template preparation kit (Roche) and stored -80 o C. Gene mutations were studied using TMB (T\u0131bMolBiol) LightMix Kit JAK2V617F genomic and analyzed by Light Cycler 2.0 Roche Diagnostic, GmBh, Germany in both groups. Findings JAK2V617F mutation was found 1 of 164 ALL patients (0,6%), 0 of 52 AML patients (0%) in childhood. Nevertheless, JAK2V617F mutation was also found 71 of 79 PV patients (89,8%), 22 of 51 ET patients (43,1%), 1 of 22 CML patients (4,5%) and 15 of 24 PMF patients (62,5%) in adulthood. Result As a result we found high frequency of JAK2V617F mutation in PV patients than the other myeloproliferative disorders. JAK2V617F mutation was significantly high in myeloproliferative disorders in adulthood comparing with childhood acute leukemias (p<0,01). Also, this mutation was significantly high in PV patients comparing with the other myeloproliferative disorders (P<0,05). We found statistically significance between genotype and allels distribution of JAK2V617F mutation (p<0.001) and determined that T-allels may be risk of disease in terms of allel distrubition (p<0.001). Thsi study is one of the widest series to investigation of JAK2V617F mutation frequency especially in childhood hematologic malignancies and we showed that this mutation is almost all 0% in this age group. On the other hand, we showed that JAK2V617F mutation with using realtime PCR test is very useful test for diagnosing PV and ET desase. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
