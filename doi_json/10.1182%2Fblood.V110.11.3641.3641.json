    "abstract_text": "In the glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX complex, GP Ib\u03b1 contains the binding region for its ligand von Willebrand factor (vWF). How the other subunits in the complex, GP Ib\u03b2 and GP IX, regulate the GP Ib\u03b1-vWF interaction is not clear. Since GP Ib\u03b1 connects with two GP Ib\u03b2 subunits via disulfide bonds, these inter-subunit covalent links may be important to the proper vWF-binding activity of the GP Ib-IX complex. To test this idea, we have obtained Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the mutant GP Ib-IX complex (CHO\u03b1 SS \u03b2IX) in which both residues C484 and C485 of GP Ib\u03b1 were changed to Ser. As expected, the mutant GP Ib\u03b1 did not form any disulfide bonds with GP Ib\u03b2 in these cells. Nonetheless, co-immunoprecipitation experiments in the digitonin-containing buffer demonstrated that association of GP Ib\u03b1 with GP Ib\u03b2 and GP IX was retained in CHO\u03b1 SS \u03b2IX cells. The expression level of GP Ib\u03b1 in CHO\u03b1 SS \u03b2IX cells, detected by its binding to WM23, a conformation-insensitive antibody, was comparable to that in the transfected cells stably expressing the wild type GP Ib-IX complex (CHO\u03b1\u03b2IX). In contrast, binding of CHO\u03b1 SS \u03b2IX cells to AK2, SZ2 or AN51, all of which are GP Ib\u03b1-specific conformation-sensitive antibodies, was significantly different from that of CHO\u03b1\u03b2IX cells. Compared to CHO\u03b1\u03b2IX cells, ristocetin-induced binding of CHO\u03b1 SS \u03b2IX cells to vWF under static conditions was reduced by about 50% as determined by flow cytometry. Consistently, rolling of CHO\u03b1 SS \u03b2IX cells on the vWF-coated glass slide was significantly faster than CHO\u03b1\u03b2IX cells under various flow conditions. Thus, in a transfected cell model, removing the disulfide links between GP Ib\u03b1 and GP Ib\u03b2 in the GP Ib-IX complex leads to an alteration in the conformation of the ligand-binding domain in GP Ib\u03b1 and as a consequence hampers the complex binding to vWF. Our finding suggests that the relative position of GP Ib\u03b1 and GP Ib\u03b2 in the receptor complex is crucial to its vWF-binding activity, which may be exploited to modulate the GP Ib\u03b1-vWF interaction.",
