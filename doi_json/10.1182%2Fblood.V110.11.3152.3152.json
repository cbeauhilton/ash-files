    "abstract_text": "We have previously demonstrated that a 22 amino acid ideal amphipathic peptide (IAP) of K 7 L 15 composition dramatically accelerates both factor IXa and factor Xa activity. In the present work, we investigate the activity of IAP attached to a surface in view of designing a procoagulant surface to reduce hemorrhage. Our results show that IAP maintains its catalytic enhancing properties for factor IXa and factor Xa when attached to a surface. This enhancement is dependent on the presence of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain of factor X, consistent with the hypothesis that IAP behaves as a phospholipid membrane, providing a surface for the assembly of procoagulant enzymes and substrates. To further confirm this hypothesis, we demonstrate direct binding between surface-bound IAP and the Gla domain of factor X using an ELISA-based binding assay. Based on the aforementioned evidence that immobilized IAP enhances procoagulant activity, we conducted in vivo experiments using an ear-bleeding model in rabbits. We incorporated IAP into DuraSeal, a commercially available sealing agent, and found that the addition of IAP decreases the bleeding time in rabbits by 25% (p=0.0065). In conclusion, the above data provide a rationale for designing procoagulant surfaces in vivo. Further evaluation in larger animal models is warranted.",
