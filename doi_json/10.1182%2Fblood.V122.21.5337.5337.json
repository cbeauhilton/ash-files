    "abstract_text": "Objective The aim of study is to explore the relationship of C-MYC and HIF-1 \u03b1 in multiple myeloma cell lines U266,and research the influence of C-MYC/HIF-1 \u03b1 on VEGF, in order to find a new target for clinical treatment MM. Methods Transfect the siRNA c-myc plasimd,siRNA HIF-1 \u03b1 plasimd and mock plasimd into U266 cell lines respectively.RT-PCR was used to detected the expression of C-MYC and HIF-1\u03b1in different group, (fetch the C T value, using 2 -\u0394\u0394CT to calculate) .The expression of protein of C-MYC.HIF-1\u03b1and VEGF was measured with Western-blot in different group,((using the ratio of purpose gene and internal reference \u03b2-actin expression as the final results). Results compared with the control group, the expression of C-MYC, HIF-1 \u03b1 and VEGF was decreased in the siRNA c-myc group, which differences are statistically significant ( p <0.05), the expression of HIF-1 \u03b1 and VEGF was decreased in the siRNA c-myc group ,which differences are statistically significant ( p <0.05),the expression of C-MYC have no obvious decline compared with control group. Conclusion The expression of HIF-1 \u03b1 depends on the regulation of C-MYC gene, synthesis and secretion of VEGF depends on C-MYC/HIF-1 \u03b1, C-MYC/HIF-1 \u03b1 may serve as a new target for treatment of MM.
