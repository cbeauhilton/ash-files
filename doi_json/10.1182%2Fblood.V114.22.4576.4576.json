    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4576 In the case of a nuclear explosion, combined injuries may include ionizing irradiation and bone fracture. We evaluated the potential bone wound healing stimulation capacity of a new mitochondrial targeted nitroxide - JP4-039 - that was developed and demonstrated to protect against total body irradiation. JP4-039 was synthesized by coupling Tempol (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tertamethylpiperidine-N-oxyl) and a novel alkene isotere analog of a gramicidin S (GS) fragment. JP4-039 is now being tested to determine whether it can also improve osseous wound healing. A model for osseous wound healing was used in the right hind leg of C57BL/6NHsd female mice and irradiated in doses ranging from 0 to 30 Gy, then holes drilled in both tibias 24 hr later. The mice were sacrificed at 7, 14, 21, 28 or 35 days. Tibial wounding and x-rays were used for determination of wound size. The bones were fixed, sectioned, and examined for osseous wound repair. A significant irradiation- induced delay in wound repair (hole diameter) was detected at 21 days in both the 20 Gy (0.93 \u00b1 0.11 mm, p=0.008) and 30 Gy (1.1 \u00b1 0.1 mm, p=0.0002) groups, compared with the 0 Gy group (0.67 \u00b1 0.23 mm). At 28 days, there were statistically significant increased hole diameters between each irradiation groups (10 Gy, 0.76 \u00b1 0.08 mm, p=0.003; 20 Gy, 0.87 \u00b1 0.36 mm, p=0.04; 30 Gy, 0.76 \u00b1 0.22 mm, p=0.02) and the 0 Gy group (0.32 \u00b1 0.32 mm). By day 35, the wounds in the 0 Gy group were healed (0.08 \u00b1 0.17 mm), while wounds in the 20 Gy group (0.22 \u00b1 0.24 mm, p=0.02) and 30 Gy group (0.34 \u00b1 0.23 mm, p=0.001) remained significantly larger. To determine whether JP4-039 improved the time of osseous wound healing, mice were injected intraperitoneally with JP4-039 (10 mg/kg) 10 min before drilling holes in both rear legs. Mice injected with JP4-039 before drilling showed significant improvement in osseous wound healing in 14 days and 21 days after drilling (0.55 \u00b1 0.3 and 0.47 \u00b1 0.04 mm, respectively), compared with 0.84 \u00b1 0.05 and 0.64 \u00b1 0.05 mm, respectively for control mice (p < 0.05 according to Tukey's multiple comparison statistical test). To test whether JP4-039 can improve osseous wound healing in irradiated limbs, mice were injected with JP4-039 (10 mg/kg) 10 min before 20 Gy to the right hind leg. Wounds were made in both tibae 24 hr after irradiation. At 21 and 28 days after wounding, bones from JP4-039 treated-irradiated mice displayed improved healing with holes of 0.51 \u00b1 0.05 and 0.37 \u00b1 0.04 mm, respectively, compared with 1.01 \u00b1 0.10 and 0.76 \u00b1 0.13 mm, respectively, for control irradiated bones. This is significant at < 0.05 as calculated using a Tukey's multiple comparison statistical test. Histopathological evaluation of specimens from mice pre-treated with JP4-039 prior to irradiation confirmed radiographic evidence of improved healing. Thus, JP4-039 enhances bone repair and is effective in a combined irradiation injury setting. Supported by NIAID/NIH grant U19AI068021 and BARDA Contract HHSO10200800062C.
