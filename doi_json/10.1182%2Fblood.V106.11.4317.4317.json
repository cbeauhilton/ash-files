    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Amiodarone is associated with several adverse effects, including hematologic side effects such as pancytopenia, hemolytic anemia and aplastic anemia. Very few cases of amiodarone-induced bone marrow granulomas have been reported. METHODS: We report 2 cases of amiodarone-induced bone marrow granulomas. Patient 1: 81-year-old male presented with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly after 2 years of amiodarone. Patient 2: 80-year-old male presented with pancytopenia 2 \u00bd years after starting amiodarone. Examination was unrmarkable. Bone marrow biopsies on both patients showed non-caseating granulomas with negative stains for acid-fast bacilli and fungi. Both had normal CBC before amiodarone therapy. The literature was reviewed for amiodarone-induced bone marrow granulomas on MEDLINE. RESULTS: There are 8 cases of amiodarone-induced bone marrow granulomas in the literature. Male: female - 5:3. One also had amiodarone-induced hepatic granulomas. Amiodarone was stopped in 5 cases with the improvement of granulomas in 3 cases. Patient characteristics and outcomes are shown below.  Ref .
