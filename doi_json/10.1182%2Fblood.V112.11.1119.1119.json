    "abstract_text": "The hematopoietic cell transplantation-comorbidity index (HCT-CI) has been proposed as a means to estimate the risk of transplant-related mortality (TRM) and the likelihood of overall survival (OS) after allogeneic HSCT. However, its value and applicability remain unclear; in a 2-center study, it was predictive of outcome at one but not at the other in multivariate analysis ( Blood 2007 ; 110 : 4606 ). We investigated the effect of HCT-CI in 130 adult patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing reduced-intensity HSCT after 100 mg/m 2 melphalan (+ 50 mg/kg cyclophosphamide if no prior autograft). GVHD prophylaxis comprised cyclosporine/tacrolimus and MMF. 18% of the donor-patient pairs were 1 antigen/allele-mismatched. 57% had refractory disease. 45% had failed an autograft. ECOG performance status (PS) was 0\u201334%, 1\u201348%, 2\u201314%, and 3\u20134%. The HCT-CI score distribution was 0\u201310%, 1\u20134%, 2\u201328%, 3\u201324%, 4\u201315%, 5\u201310%, 6\u20138%, and \u22657\u20132%. Overall, the patient population had higher HCT-CI scores than described in other studies ( Cancer 2008 ; 112 : 1992 ). In multivariate analysis, TRM was higher with HLA mismatch and PS 2-3, and OS was lower with PS 2-3, HLA mismatch, refractory disease, donor age >45 y, elevated LDH, and platelets <100. HCT-CI 0 vs 1-2 vs \u22653 had no effect on TRM or OS. HCT-CI 0-2 vs \u22653 had a borderline effect on TRM (P=0.09) and OS (P=0.15) in univariate analysis, but no effect in multivariate analysis when forced into the model with factors known to be significant. No significant correlation was seen between HCT-CI and any of the factors found to be predictive of outcome.

As shown in the figure below, it did. We expected that it would correlate with HCT-CI because increasing comorbidity should theoretically be associated with declining albumin. However, it did not. View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure In our experience, HCT-CI does not correlate with outcome \u2013 especially when other pertinent factors are taken into account. Since most data supporting HCT-CI have originated from a single center, it is possible that its applicability depends on individual centers and the treatment protocols employed. However, lack of correlation of HCT-CI with albumin does call its biological plausibility into some question. HCT-CI cannot be employed unless refined and validated prospectively in multi-center studies."
