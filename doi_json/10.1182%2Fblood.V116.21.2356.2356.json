    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2356 Introduction: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is commonly offered to patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) over the age of 55 with good performance status. For this patient population, potential sibling donors are necessarily older and have more comorbidities than siblings of younger patients. It is not known whether the advanced donor age of older patients outweighs the beneficial effect of having a sibling donor. To address this question, we retrospectively analyzed data from 62 consecutive patients who received allogeneic SCT at the Cleveland Clinic from 1990\u20132009. Methods: Inclusion criteria were: age \u2265 55 years, diagnosis of AML, and history of myeloablative or nonmyeloablative allogeneic SCT from related or unrelated adult donors. 31 patients underwent transplantation from matched related donors (30 siblings, 1 cousin). 31 patients received unrelated donor transplants. The median age was 59 for patients with related and unrelated donors (P=0.89). There was an equal percentage of males (64.5%) in both groups (P=1.0). There was an equivalent distribution hematopoietic cell transplant comorbidity index scores of low, intermediate and high for patients with related and unrelated donors (38.7%, 37.1% and 24.2% vs. 38.7%, 32.3%, and 29.0% P = 0.65). 45.2% of patients with related donors underwent myeloablative conditioning vs. 54.8% for patients with unrelated donors (P =0.61). Results: Sibling donors were significantly older than unrelated donors [median 59 years (range 41\u201375) vs. 36 (range 24\u201358), P < 0.001]. The incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was similar in both groups. At five years, the cumulative incidence of relapse (43.2% vs. 38.7%, P = 0.88), non-relapse mortality (48.1% vs. 48.8%, P =0.91) and overall survival (17.2% vs. 24.1%, P =0.88) were similar for recipients of matched related and unrelated donor transplants. Older donor age was not predictive of death in univariate or multivariate analysis. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival for recipients of related and unrelated donor transplants are shown.

Advanced donor age should not be a contraindication to allogeneic SCT for older patients with AML. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
