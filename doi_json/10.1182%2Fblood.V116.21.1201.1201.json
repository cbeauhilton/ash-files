    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1201 Background. Before the era of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) was the treatment of choice in CML and prolonged survival of responding patients. Recent studies suggest that combination of IFN-\u03b1 with TKI improves therapy outcome. Significantly, a proportion of IFN-\u03b1 treated patients in prolonged complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR) have been able to discontinue treatment without disease relapse (Mahon et al. JCO 2002). The mechanism of action of IFN-\u03b1 therapy is incompletely understood; the drug exerts both direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects on leukemic cells. The aim of this project was to study the immunomodulatory effects of IFN-\u03b1 in CML patients in prolonged remission and isolate biological markers predicting response. Patients and methods. The study population consisted of CML patients treated with IFN-\u03b1 monotherapy (n = 10, median therapy time 146 months, range 63\u2013231 months) and CML patients who had discontinued IFN-\u03b1 therapy but remained in remission for >2 years (n = 9, median therapy time 120 months, range 80\u2013184; median time without therapy 53 months, range 24\u201396). None of the patients were previously treated with TKI therapy. In addition, non-CML patients (3 patients with essential trombocythemia and one patient with polycythemia vera) treated with IFN-\u03b1 and healthy volunteers (n = 43) were included as controls. Lymphocyte populations in all four groups were characterized with comprehensive immunophenotyping panels. The clonality of T-cells was analyzed by a TCR \u03b3/\u03b4 rearrangement assay by PCR. Lymphocytes were further sorted into CD3 + TCR \u03b1\u03b2 + and CD3 + TCR \u03b3\u03b4 + populations (n = 8). Additionally, plasma levels of 25 cytokines were measured with a multiplex bead-based cytokine assay (Luminex\u00ae). Results. The proportion of NK-cells from lymphocytes was significantly increased in IFN-\u03b1 discontinued patients (median 26%, range 18\u201351%) compared to healthy volunteers (11%, 5\u201321%) or patients on IFN-\u03b1 therapy (12%, 6\u201331%)(P=0.0005). Similarly the proportion of CD8 + cells from T-cells was significantly increased in both CML IFN-\u03b1 groups (55% in IFN-\u03b1 discontinued patients, 44% in IFN-\u03b1 treated patients vs. 31% in healthy volunteers; P<0.05 for both groups). Also a larger proportion of T-cells expressed the long-term memory antigen CD45RO in IFN-\u03b1 patients (74%, 58% vs. 44% in healthy controls, P<0.01). The proportion of regulatory T-cells (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) was increased in IFN-\u03b1 groups (6.1%, 5.2% vs. 3.8% in healthy volunteers, P=0.01). Similar changes in immunoprofile were not observed in IFN-treated non-CML patients. Clonal TCR \u03b3/\u03b4 rearrangements were observed in 18 of 19 (95%) IFN-treated CML patients as compared to 3 of 22 (14%) in healthy volunteers (P<0.01). In both IFN-\u03b1 CML patient groups a unique rearrangement pattern was observed: 14/19 (79%) of patients had the V\u03b39 gene clonally rearranged. This clonal rearrangement resided in CD3 + \u03b3\u03b4 + T-cell population, as assessed by cell sorting. Two of four non-CML patients treated with IFN-\u03b1 had the same clonal rearrangement, as well as one healthy control (1/22; 5%). Similar clonality patterns have not been observed in dasatinib or imatinib treated CML patients (Kreutzman et al. Blood 2010). IFN-\u03b1 treatment was associated with a distinct plasma cytokine profile in CML patients. IP-10, IL-6, IL-12, eotaxin, MCP-1, and IFN-\u03b3 levels were significantly increased in IFN-\u03b1 treated CML patients. In particular, eotaxin and MCP-1 levels differed significantly between healthy controls and IFN-\u03b1 patients who had successfully discontinued IFN-\u03b1 therapy (428 vs. 1173 pg/ml, P<0.0001 and 107 vs. 459 pg/ml, P=0.0003, respectively). In IFN-\u03b1 treated non-CML patients, eotaxin or MCP-1 levels were not increased. Conclusions. Our results show that IFN-\u03b1 treatment induces distinct changes in the immunoprofile of CML patients. Patients who had successfully discontinued IFN-\u03b1 therapy differed markedly from healthy controls. IFN-\u03b1 therapy was associated with increased numbers of NK-cells and clonal \u03b3\u03b4 + T-cells. These cells possess potent anti-leukemic activity and may contribute to the prolonged therapy responses in this group of patients. Furthermore, plasma cytokine profile could be a helpful biomarker when considering which patients can discontinue the IFN-\u03b1 treatment without imminent disease relapse.
