A Report from Children's Oncology Group (COG) Study AALL0232. Minimal residual disease is one of the strongest prognostic factors in pediatric ALL. COG AALL0232 was a phase 3 randomized trial for patients 1\u201330 years old with newly diagnosed NCI HR B precursor ALL that used a 2\u00d72 factorial study design comparing dexamethasone (DEX) versus(vs.) prednisone(PRED) during induction, and high dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) vs. Capizzi methotrexate (C-MTX) during interim maintenance 1(IM-1). We previously reported improved event-free survival (EFS) for patients receiving HD-MTX vs. C-MTX (J Clin Oncol 29: 6s, 2011) and for DEX vs. PRED among patients =0.1% MRD at end induction, as well as patients with morphologic slow early response or specific adverse genetic features received intensified therapy including IM-2 and a second delayed intensification, and then had MRD determined at end consolidation, (about 13 weeks post diagnosis). End induction MRD > =0.01% was highly predictive of inferior outcome, though patients with 0.1\u20131% MRD who received intensive therapy had very low rates of early relapse and a much higher rate of late relapse.

However, patients who were MRD positive at end induction who became negative by end consolidation had improved 5y EFS of 79\u00b19%(n=136) compared to 52\u00b114% for those who remained MRD positive(n=52) (p=.0012). Both end induction MRD positive and negative patients benefitted from HD-MTX vs. C-MTX, though the effect was small and did not reach statistical significance for MRD positive patients. By contrast, end-induction MRD was highly predictive of outcome for patients receiving either HD-MTX or C-MTX. 5 y EFS as a function of MRD status and IM regimen.  End induction MRD . Capizzi .

However, DEX patients <10y if anything had a slightly higher rate of end induction MRD positivity than those given PRED (22% vs. 17%, p=.073). In multivariate analysis, end consolidation MRD was the most powerful prognostic factor for the small subset of patients in whom this was assessed. Excluding this, end induction MRD was the most significant variable; age, white blood cell count, day 15 marrow morphology and HD-MTX vs. C-MTX were also significant. We conclude that MRD remains the most powerful prognostic factor even in the context of improved therapy. Additionally, for those patients who were MRD positive at end induction, achieving MRD negative status by end consolidation improved outcome significantly. The higher frequency of MRD in younger patients receiving DEX calls into question the validity of using end induction MRD as a surrogate for outcome when testing novel interventions during induction therapy.
