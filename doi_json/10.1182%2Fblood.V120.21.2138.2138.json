    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2138 Macrophage fusion leading to the formation of multinucleated giant cells (MGCs) is a hallmark of many chronic inflammatory reactions. MGCs are an invariable constituent of tuberculoid lesions and also found in a variety of conditions leading to granulomatous inflammation as well as the foreign body reaction. Despite the prominent phenotype, the molecular mechanisms underlying macrophage fusion are not well understood. MGCs originate from macrophages that are recruited to sites of chronic inflammation. The major myelo-monocytic integrin \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 (CD11b/CD18, Mac-1), together with a related integrin \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 (CD11d/CD18), mediate critical adhesive reactions of monocyte/macrophages. The function of \u03b2 2 integrins in macrophage fusion remains controversial. Some studies using function blocking antibodies implicated \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 in the cell/substrate adhesive interactions that are required for MGC formation, whereas one recent report indicated that this integrin plays a minor role. Moreover, the contribution of \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 , a receptor with recognition specificity overlapping that of \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 , to macrophage fusion is unknown. To evaluate the role of \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 and \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 in MGC formation, we examined fusion of inflammatory peritoneal macrophages isolated from wild-type mice and mice with deficiency of \u03b1 M or \u03b1 D integrin subunits. Macrophages were isolated at day 3 after thioglycollate injection and cultured for 24\u201372 hours in the presence of IL-4 to induce fusion. Percentage fusion was quantified as the number of giant cell nuclei (\u22652 nuclei) to the number of total nuclei. The number of fused macrophages isolated from wild-type mice gradually increased and \u223c40\u201350% macrophages formed MGCs after IL-4 stimulation by day 3. Analyses of fusion of \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 -deficient macrophages demonstrated that fusion was significantly reduced. By day 3, macrophage fusion of \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 -deficient macrophages was 23 \u00b1 2% of wild-type macrophages. Fusion of \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 -deficient macrophages was also decreased and the change was statistically significant, albeit to a smaller degree (75 \u00b1 4%). Using a mouse model of sterile peritonitis induced by thioglycollate injection, we also examined the formation of MGCs in vivo . In wild-type mice, the number of MGCs gradually increased from 2.5 \u00b1 0.3% at day 0 (resident macrophages) to 17 \u00b1 2% at day 18 (the resolution phase of inflammation). Moreover, expression of \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 and \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 on peritoneal macrophages increased by \u223c2 and 1.6-fold, respectively, on 18 th day after induction of inflammation. In \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 -deficient mice, the number of MGCs was reduced by 2.1-fold compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, while the size of wild-type and \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 -deficient giant cells was the same, the number of cells with 3 and more nuclei in fused \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 -deficient MGCs was 4-fold less than in wild-type cells. The results indicate that both \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 and \u03b1 D \u03b2 2 integrins support macrophage fusion with \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 playing a dominant role.
