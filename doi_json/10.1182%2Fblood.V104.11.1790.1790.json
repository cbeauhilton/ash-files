    "abstract_text": "HuM195, a humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody, targets myeloid leukemia cells and has activity against minimal residual disease. To enhance the potency of native HuM195 and avoid nonspecific cytotoxicity seen with \u03b2-emitting radioimmunoconjugates, the \u03b1-emitting radiometal 213 Bi was conjugated to HuM195. The feasibility, safety, and antileukemic activity of therapy with 213 Bi-HuM195 were shown in a phase I trial (Jurcic et al. Blood 2002). Because of the short-range (50\u201380 \u03bcm) and high linear energy transfer (8400 keV) of \u03b1 particles, radioimmunotherapy with 213 Bi is ideally suited for the treatment of residual disease. To determine the effects of 213 Bi-HuM195 after partial cytoreduction with chemotherapy, we treated 25 patients (median age, 67 years; range, 49\u201380) with cytarabine 200 mg/m 2 /day for 5 days followed by 213 Bi-HuM195 in a phase I/II trial. Fourteen patients had relapsed or primary refractory AML; 5 patients had previously untreated de novo AML, and 6 patients had untreated secondary AML. Sixteen patients had intermediate-risk cytogenetics, and 9 had poor-risk cytogenetics. During the phase I portion of the study, cohorts of 3\u20136 patients were treated with 0.5, 0.75, 1, and 1.25 mCi/kg. At the 1.25 mCi/kg dose level, 2 of the 4 patients had dose-limiting myelosuppression (grade 4 leukopenia lasting \u2265 35 days) and 1 patient died of progressive pneumonia. Therefore, the maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 1 mCi/kg. No responses were seen at the first two dose levels. Seven of the 19 patients (37%) who received 1 mCi/kg (n=15) or 1.25 mCi/kg (n=4) responded. There were 2 CRs lasting 9 and 12 months; 3 CRp (CR with incomplete platelet recovery) lasting 1, 2, and 6 months and 2 PRs lasting 3 and 8 months. The median time from initiation of chemotherapy to recovery of leukocyte counts was 34 days (range, 21\u201359 days). Delayed count recovery was attributed to persistent leukemia in 6 patients. Neutropenic fever occurred in all patients, and 19 patients had documented infections. At the phase II dose level, two of the 15 patients died of progressive infections, and one had grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia. The most common extramedullary toxicities were transient, low-grade elevations in liver function tests (n=19) and serum creatinine (n=11). Thirteen patients had infusion-related reactions following the first injection of 213 Bi-HuM195, typically characterized by reversible grade 1 or 2 fever and/or chills. One patient had orthostatic hypotension and syncope after the first antibody infusion associated with concomitant bacteremia. Sequential administration of cytarabine and 213 Bi-HuM195 is tolerable and can produce complete remissions in patients with AML.",
