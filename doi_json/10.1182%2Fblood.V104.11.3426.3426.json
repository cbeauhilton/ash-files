    "abstract_text": "CD45 is a hematopoietic lineage-restricted antigen that is expressed on all hematopoietic cells except for some mature cell types. Cells expressing CD45 and CD34 but lacking CD38 and lineage antigens (CD45 + CD34 + CD38 \u2212 Lin \u2212 cells) are well-documented hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and CD45 + CD34 \u2212 CD38 \u2212 Lin \u2212 cells are probably less mature HSCs. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), the malignant transformation site was reported to be committed myeloid progenitors and, more recently, the CD45 + CD34 + CD38 \u2212 Lin \u2212 HSCs. In this study, we detected CD45 \u2212 CD34 \u2212 CD38 \u2212 Lin \u2212 cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow of MDS patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that CD45 \u2212 CD34 \u2212 CD38 \u2212 Lin \u2212 cells had the same chromosomal aberration as the myeloblasts. In addition to CD45- and CD34-negativity, they lacked CD117 and CD133 expressions. Generally, MDS cells have extremely reduced hematopoietic potential compared with normal hematopoietic cells, but we documented the following in some cases. Freshly-isolated CD45 \u2212 CD34 \u2212 CD38 \u2212 Lin \u2212 cells did not form any hematopoietic colonies but had long-term culture-initiating cell activity. When these cells were co-cultured with stroma cells, CD45 \u2212 CD34 \u2212 CD38 \u2212 Lin \u2212 cells showed only weak potential for proliferation/differentiation, yet differentiated to CD34 + cells and then mature myeloid cells. This newly-identified cell population represents the most immature immunophenotype so far identified in the hematopoietic lineage and is involved in the malignant clone in MDS.",
