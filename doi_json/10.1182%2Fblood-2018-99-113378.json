    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) represent a heterogeneous spectrum of hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by inefficient hematopoiesis, peripheral blood cytopenia, dysplasia in one or more myeloid cell lineages, and a tendency to evolve into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Hypomethylating agent azacitidine (AZA) is a standard therapy for patients with higher-risk MDS and AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). The DLK1-DIO3 region is located on chromosome 14q32 and contains one of the largest miRNA clusters in the genome. Functions of these miRNAs have been linked to apoptosis and proliferation. Their expression is under the control of a differentially methylated region (DMR) located in the promoter of MEG3 gene. Significant overexpression of these miRNAs has previously been found in MDS and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). In APL, this upregulation has been linked to hypermethylation of MEG3 -DMR. AIMS: We examined (i) expression of the 14q32 miRNAs and mRNAs ( DLK1 , RTL1 , DIO3 , MEG3 , and MEG8 ) and (ii) DNA methylation of MEG3 -DMR in patients with higher-risk MDS and AML-MRC before and during AZA treatment with the aim to reveal whether the overexpression of these miRNAs is epigenetically regulated in myelodysplasia. METHODS: The study comprised 24 paired samples of CD34+ bone marrow cells obtained from 12 patients with higher-risk MDS and AML-MRC before and during AZA therapy. miRNA profiling was done using Agilent microarrays and mRNA levels of the genes located within the 14q32 region were assessed by Illumina microarrays. Measurement of MEG3 level by RT-qPCR confirmed the microarray results on an independent cohort (81 MDS and 14 AML-MRC patients, and 13 controls). Methylation status of MEG3 promoter was investigated by amplicon bisulfite sequencing. RESULTS: We studied levels of miRNAs and mRNAs encoded in the DLK1-DIO3 region and found that 50 % of untreated patients showed strong upregulation of expression activity within the locus. Following AZA therapy, we observed a significant reduction in the miRNA/mRNA expression to nearly normal levels, suggesting that expression activity might be affected by hypomethylation. Interestingly, expression levels of miRNAs and mRNAs positively correlated, indicating that transcriptional activity was regulated uniformly throughout the region. Evaluation of expression data with clinical features in the pretreatment samples revealed that expression activity was related to BM blast count, patient diagnosis, and outcome. High expression was significantly associated with the diagnosis of AML-MRC and poor outcome, whereas low expression with MDS and favorable outcome. No chromosomal abnormality or cytogenetic risk category was linked to the expression changes. In the patients before treatment, we revealed a significant hypermethylation of a part of the MEG3 -DMR that closely preceded the MEG3 start codon. This hypermethylation was seen in 50 % of the patients and negatively correlated with expression activity. Interestingly, the hypermethylation was associated with longer progression-free survival after initiation of AZA therapy (hazard ratio = 0.220, P = 0.03). Following AZA therapy, we identified an apparent decrease of methylation in another part of MEG3 -DMR. This hypomethylation might be attributed to the hypomethylating effect of AZA and could therefore influence the deregulated expression of the miRNA cluster. Finally, we investigated the potential application of the deregulation observed in this locus for prognostic purposes regarding the responsiveness to AZA treatment. Although, we identified changes in expression and methylation levels before AZA therapy, these changes were not associated with future response status. CONLUSIONS: Here, we correlated changes in expression of 14q32 miRNAs and mRNAs with specific methylation changes in its regulatory sequences in higher-risk MDS and AML-MRC patients treated with AZA. We thoroughly investigated a complex regulatory mechanism within this region and based on our data, we assumed that epigenetic alterations affect expression activity in the locus. However, also other mechanisms such as influence of some transcription factors may play yet unrecognized roles in the resulting state.
