    "abstract_text": "Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) have been associated with increased rates of pregnancy complications. Women with essential thrombocythemia (ET), and, much less frequently, polycythemia vera (PV) present at a childbearing age and it has been reported that up to a third of MPN pregnancies may fail as first trimester miscarriages. A recent study has demonstrated that the JAK2 V617F mutation, seen in nearly all PV cases and half of those with ET, was significantly more common in women with a first unexplained pregnancy loss compared to controls, although the overall incidence was low (1.06% of women with a first unexplained pregnancy loss versus 0.2% in controls, p10 weeks) by a tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay with a sensitivity of detection of 1% JAK2 V617F. 92% of women had a history of early miscarriage and 14.1% of late miscarriage. Detailed clinical information was available for 230 (59%) cases: the mean age was 35.9 years (standard deviation=5.4; range: 20\u201350) and the median number of miscarriages was 3 (range: 3\u20137). Factors known to be associated with recurrent miscarriages were excluded. The JAK2 V617F mutation was not detected in any case, yielding a 95% confidence interval for the prevalence of the mutation ranging from 0 to 0.009 and excluding a 1% prevalence of JAK2 V617F in this population (p=0.038 for the overall population; p=0.057 for early miscarriages only; 2-tailed Clopper-Pearson exact test). Our study therefore demonstrates no enrichment of JAK2 V617F among unselected women with a history of recurrent miscarriages. Although we cannot exclude the possibility of a small, significant excess of V617F over background levels, our findings indicate that a latent maternal JAK2 V617F-positive MPN is an unlikely cause of miscarriage.",
