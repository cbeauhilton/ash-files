    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2165 Secretory Leukocyte Protease Inhibitor (SLPI) is a cationic serine protease inhibitor with antiprotease, primarily anti-Neutrophil ELastase (NE), activities. Moreover, SLPI modulates intracellular signal transduction pathways such as NF-kB and Erk. The molecular interaction and the balance between NE and SLPI is tightly regulated. On the one side, NE upregulates the SLPI expression and at the other hand SLPI inhibits the NE-induced degradation of proteins. We identified severe diminished levels of SLPI mRNA in CD33 + myeloid cells and in PMNs of patients with severe congenital neutropenia (CN) harbouring either ELANE or HAX1 mutations, as compared to patients with cyclic neutropenia (CyN) and to healthy individuals. SLPI protein levels in plasma of CN patients were also significantly reduced. We further analysed whether diminished levels of SLPI are associated with the \u201ematuration arrest\u201c of myeloid cells seen in CN patients. We inhibited SLPI using lentivirus-based transduction of the myeloid cell line NB4 with SLPI-specific shRNA and analysed ATRA-triggered myeloid differentiation. Indeed, myeloid differentiation was severely affected in NB4 cells transduced with SLPI-specific shRNA, as compared to control shRNA transduced cells. Further, we analysed the mechanisms leading to SLPI downregulation. Previously, we identified severely reduced mRNA and protein levels of NE in myeloid cells and in plasma of CN patients with either ELANE or HAX1 mutations, as compared to healthy individuals. Knowing that NE induces SLPI expression, we assumed that diminished NE levels may be responsible for the low SLPI expression in CN patients. Indeed, inhibition of NE in the myeloid cell line NB4 using NE-specific shRNAs led to diminished expression of SLPI mRNA, as compared to ctrl shRNA transduced cells. At the same time, we also found that transduction of the myeloid cell line NB4 with wild type (WT) NE resulted in the increased expression of SLPI mRNA but mutated (MUT) forms of NE as found in CN patients were not able to induce SLPI mRNA, as compared to ctrl transduced cells. Taken together, both diminished NE levels and mutations in ELANE gene may cause downregulation of SLPI. In summary, SLPI is severely downregulated in CN patients due to defective NE protein levels and ELANE mutations. As a consequence, the anti-microbial and antiinflammatory activities of SLPI are diminished in CN patients. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
