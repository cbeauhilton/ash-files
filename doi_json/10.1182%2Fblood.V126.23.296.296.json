    "abstract_text": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disorder due to mutations in one of the sixteen FANC genes involved in DNA repair. Many FA patients develop bone marrow failure (BMF) during childhood, and FA strongly predisposes to myelodysplasia syndrome and/or acute myeloid leukaemia. The pathogenesis of the BMF remains uncompletely understood. Low hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPCs) counts observed early in life and preceeding the onset of blood cytopenia in patients led we, and other, to hypothesize that the hematopoietic development might be abnormal in the FA embryo. Indeed, unlike adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) which are quiescent in the BM niche, during embryonic life HSCs are in active proliferation in sites of expansion such as fetal liver and placenta, where they get amplified and acquire properties of adult HSC .We hypothesized that in FA, the FA defect in response to the replicative stress could impair the expension of the HSC pool.In order to investigate this hypothesis, we carried out studies in Fancg-/- knock out mice and in human FA fetuses obtained with informed consent from medical abortion. In Fancg-/- mice, FACS analysis revealed a 1,5- to 3-fold deficiency in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) very early during embryonic development (i.e 11.5 days of gestation - E11.5) in fetal liver (FL) and placenta (Pl) ( p <0.001). In both organs, this defect persists during the whole period of amplification (until E14.5 for FL and E12.5 for Pl). In vitro clonogenic assays also demonstrated a 2- fold defect in granulocyte, erythrocyte and macrophage (GEM) progenitors both in Fancg-/- FL or Pl compared to WT ( p <0.001), and 4 to 5- fold defect in more immature mixed GEM progenitors in FL ( p <0.001). LTC-IC frequency of the HSC-enriched Lineage - Sca1 + AA4.1 + population (LSA) of E14.5 Fancg-/- FL comforted this later result, since it was 5-fold lower than for WT. In vivo long-term hematopoietic reconstitution (LTR) assays confirmed a deficit of the HSC enriched LSA population of E14.5 Fancg-/- FL. Indeed, although the percentage of mice reconstituted was as good as that obtained with the same number of WT LSA, the CD45 Ly5.2 chimerism was reduced (49\u00b120% vs 84\u00b14% for 1000 LSA injected, and 56\u00b112% vs 87\u00b12% for 5000 LSA). Interestingly, bone marrow analysis of mice reconstituted with Fancg-/- LSA 22 weeks after injection showed a level of CD45 Ly5.2 chimerism 3-fold lower than that found in blood, spleen and thymus, as well as a very low chimerism for myeloid GEM lineages, contrasting with a high chimerism for B and T lymphoid lineages. Moreover, we were able to demonstrate that this deficit is already present at E12.5, both in Fancg-/- FL and Pl. Indeed, no mice reconstituted with 3.10 5 total Fancg-/- fetal liver cells, while 100% injected with the same number of WT FL cells got reconstituted with a chimerism of 59,5\u00b15%. For Pl, when 500 000 cells were injected, reconstitution was observed in only 1 out of 3 mice for Fancg-/- (29% chimerism), and in 3 out of 3 mice for WT (88\u00b14% chimerism). In human FA FL of 14 weeks of gestation, we also observed a 4-fold defect of HSPC with a total lack of in vitro amplification compared to control, in agreement with the mice data. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a profound deficit of HSCs and progenitors cells is present since the earlier stages of embryonic development in FA. In addition, using organotypic cultures of E11 aortas, we could show that this defect of amplification is already present in HSCs emerging from Fancg-/- aorta, which showed a 2-fold lower rate of amplification compared to WT. More importantly, our results show for the first time exhaustion in myeloid lineage of FA, in agreement with what is observed in children with FA disease. Altogether, our work suggests a role of the FA pathway during the development of the hematopoietic system leading to a deficit of amplification of HSC. Comparison of FA HSC transcriptome with that of control HSC in FL and Pl is in progress. It should allow to identify the key pathways involved in the embryonic HSC amplification that are deregulated in FA, and hopefully getting more insights in the pathogenesis of the BMF and leukemogenesis in FA patients.
