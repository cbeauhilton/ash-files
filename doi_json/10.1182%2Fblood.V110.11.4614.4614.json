    "abstract_text": "Lenalidomide can be effective in treatment of MDS, particularly in patients with isolated 5q deletion, as well as in patients with 5q\u2212 with other karyotypic abnormalities ( List et. al. NEJM  355 , 1456 ; 2006 ). However, there is little data for secondary MDS. We report two patients with chemotherapy-induced MDS with 5q\u2212, both treated with lenalidomide, one of whom responded. Case 1: An 81-year-old female with multiple myeloma who had been treated with melphalan and prednisone developed worsening anemia despite continued biochemical remission of her myeloma. Three years after melphalan treatment, a bone marrow revealed MDS with only 2% plasma cells. Cytogenetics showed: 46, XX, del(5)(q13q33), del(14)(q1?3), add(22)(q13)[1]/46, sl, del(20)(q13.1) [9]/47, sdl1, +8[10]. The patient was transfusion dependent despite treatment with EPO. She was treated with lenalidomide 10 mg daily and began responding after eight weeks of therapy. Her anemia improved, and she became transfusion independent until her death 6 months later from infection. Figure 1.

While in remission for lymphoma, he developed pancytopenia. A bone marrow revealed no lymphoma, but demonstrated evidence of MDS. Cytogenetics showed: 46, XY, del (5)(q13q33) [3]/44, idem, \u22127, add(19)(q13), \u221221[3]/46, XY [14]. The patient was transfusion dependent. He was treated with lenalidomide 10mg daily, demonstrating no significant benefit after 10 weeks. We report that one of our two patients with secondary MDS and 5q\u2212 responded to lenalidomide with a resolution of her transfusion requirement. Two prior cases of improvement in secondary MDS with 5q\u2212 after lenalidomide treatment have been reported ( Melchert et. al. Leukemia  21 : 1576 \u201378, 2007 ). Lenalidomide is active in some cases of secondary MDS with 5q\u2212. Further studies are needed to better define the activity of lenalidomide in secondary MDS with and without 5q\u2212."
