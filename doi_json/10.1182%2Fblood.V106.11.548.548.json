    "abstract_text": "Background: Decreased BMD is a relatively common serious complication of long-term heparin use, however there have not been adequately powered randomized controlled trials addressing its risk in association with long-term use of LMWH. The TIPPS study is an ongoing multi-center randomized trial designed to compare the effect of LMWH prophylaxis vs. no prophylaxis on pregnancy outcomes in thrombophilic pregnant women. A separate sub-study was planned a priori to assess the effect of LMWH on BMD. Methods: Pregnant women (100 kg wt. Patients (pts) were randomized to either LMWH (dalteparin [dalt] 5,000 U qd until 20 wks and then 10,000 qd until term) or control (ctrl) group. All participants received post-partum dalt 5,000 U qd from postpartum d1 to d42. BMD (hip and lumbar spine) was performed 6 wk post-partum. A sample size of 26 pts per group was calculated to detect a 10% difference in absolute BMD (\u03b1=0.05, \u03b2=0.10). Primary outcome was absolute spine BMD compared using an unpaired t-test. Results were analyzed as-treated; 31 pts received dalt and 22 did not (4 pts randomized to ctrl group crossed over). BMD and T-score results in treatement groups  . Dalteparin 1 .

Two cases of osteoporosis (Opo) and 7 cases of osteopenia (Ope) were documented in the dalt group vs 0 of Opo and 3 of Ope in the ctrl group respectively. Results of post-hoc logistic regression analysis examining the odds of obtaining an abnormal (Opo or Ope) spine or hip BMD result in both treatment groups were non significant (Crude OR 2.59; 95%CI 0.61, 10.97; p=0.20; Adjusted OR 6.83; 95%CI 0.17, 272.33; p=0.307) as well as results of post-hoc multiple linear regression to predict changes in BMD and T-scores.
