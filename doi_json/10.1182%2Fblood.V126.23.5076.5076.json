    "abstract_text": "Aim. To evaluate late nephrotoxicity of intensive modified program NHL-BFM-90 (mNHL-BFM-90) in adult poor-prognosis patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Materials and methods. The data of laboratory tests of blood and urine of 40 patients with DLBCL which received mNHL-BFM-90 protocol in the Hematology Research Center in the period from 2002 to 2009 years was analyzed. Group consisted of 20 men, 20 women, aged from 31 to 76 years, median age - 56.5 years at the time of the survey, the median period after therapy- 6 years. Individual cumulative dose of ifosfamide - 8-12 g / m 2 , cyclophosphamide - 2-3 g / m 2 , methotrexate - 6-9 g / m 2 . Comparison group included 19 patients (8 men and 11 women), aged from 39 to 78 years, median age - 70 years at the time of the survey, who received therapy to CHOP or R-CHOP. The median period after therapy - 5,5 years. Individual cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide - 3-6 g / m 2 . Laboratory tests of blood and urine were performed before chemotherapy and after 5 years after treatment. Results. From all 40 patients with DLBCL received mNHL-BFM-90, signs of chronic kidney disease were found in 32 (80%) patients, only 2 (5%) of them showed a decrease in creatinine clearance daily. In comparison group signs of chronic kidney disease were found in 12 (63%) patients, 2 patients (10.5%) showed a reduction in the daily creatinine clearance. No significant differences in the manifestations of nephrotoxicity in the long term between comparison groups were found. No significant differences in the manifestations of nephrotoxicity in the long term period were found between two groups of patients (who underwent and not underwent acute renal failure during high-dose chemotherapy). Amount of nephrotoxicity signs was significantly dependent on the presence of hypertensive disease in history (p = 0.02). Conclusion. Nephrotoxicity of high-dose mNHL-BFM 90 exceeds significantly nephrotoxicity program CHOP / R-CHOP. Conducting high-dose chemotherapy in 10 (25%) patients complicated by acute renal failure, 2 (20%) patients required hemodialysis in contrast to the group of standard chemotherapy without such complications (p=0,01). However, in the long term observations there weren't significant differences in the nephrotoxic manifestations between two groups. Impaired renal function in the long term period observed in 100% of patients undergoing acute renal failure during treatment and only in 71% of patients without acute renal failure (p=0,04). It was comparable repairing of renal function in the long term in patients undergoing high-dose therapy between patients with and without acute renal failure among those who showed signs of chronic kidney disease.
