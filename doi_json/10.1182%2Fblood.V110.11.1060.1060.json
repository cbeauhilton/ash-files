    "abstract_text": "The incidence of Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) reactivation after T cell depleted allogeneic stem cell transplantation (TCD alloSCT) is 40% the first year after transplantation. CD8 T cells are important in herpes virus reactivations. To analyze the role of CD8 T cells in VZV reactivation, we set out to develop multimeric MHC peptide complexes to be able to identify VZV specific CD8 T cells. Predictive algorithms were used to generate potential immunogenic peptides from Immediate Early (IE) proteins 4, 62 and 63 of VZV that bind in HLA-A2. 127 nonamer peptides were synthesized and tested by a high throughput peptide binding assay (REVEAL5\u2122 assay). Of the peptides that were capable of sufficient binding to the MHC molecules, ProVE\u2122 Pentamers were synthesized. 61 Pentamers were produced and used to screen for HLA-A2 restricted VZV specific T cells in peripheral blood derived from patients with clinical VZV reactivation after TCD alloSCT. In 6 out of 18 HLA-A2 positive patients after VZV reactivation, at a median of 43 days after onset of reactivation, T cells stained positive with the multimeric MHC complex that binds the ALW peptide of the IE62 protein of VZV (IE62-ALW-A2). The percentage of IE62-ALW-A2 positive T cells detected in these 6 patients ranged from 0.02% \u2013 0.13% of CD8 T cells, with a median of 0.04% of CD8 T cells. To confirm the specificity of the Pentamer positive T cells, the IE62-ALW-A2 Pentamer positive T cells were sorted from one patient single cell per well, and expanded. The T cell clones exerted cytolytic activity against HLA-A2 positive EBV-lymphoblastoid cell lines loaded with the IE62-ALW-A2 peptide, whereas unloaded target cells were not lysed. HLA-A2 positive COS cells transfected with the IE62 gene and thus endogenously expressing the IE62 protein were recognized by IE62-ALW-A2 positive T cells as demonstrated by IFNg production. In addition, peripheral blood lymphocytes were stimulated in vitro with the IE62-ALW-A2 peptide in combination with IL-2 and IL-15, and we demonstrated with this procedure that IE62-ALW-A2 positive CD8 T cells were present at a low frequency in another 3 of the 12 IE62-ALW-A2 negative patients. To study whether the immune response against the IE62-ALW-A2 epitope correlated with the course of the clinical infection, we studied the percentage of IE62-ALW-A2 positive T cell during a VZV reactivation in one patient. Six days prior to reactivation, only 0.03% of the CD8 T cells were IE62-ALW-A2 positive. At 42 days after onset of the reactivation, 0.23% of the CD8 T cells were Pentamer positive. After the reactivation resolved, IE-62-ALW-A2 specific CD8 T cells declined to 0.09% at day 49 and 0.03% at day 145 after reactivation. In conclusion, we identified by using a high throughput peptide binding assay and Pentamer production, a new immune dominant epitope of VZV that is recognized by HLA-A2 restricted CD8+ T cells. We demonstrate that IE62-ALW-A2 specific T cells can recognize and lyse target cells that endogenously express the IE62 protein of VZV. In addition, we demonstrate that IE62-ALW-A2 specific T cells expand during the VZV specific immune response. This dominant epitope of VZV in combination with multimeric complexes can be a useful tool to study the immune response to VZV infection and possibly to VZV vaccination."
