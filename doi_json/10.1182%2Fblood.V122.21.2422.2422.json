    "abstract_text": "A large body of research has demonstrated that the maternal immune system is elaborately regulated during pregnancy to establish immunological tolerance to the fetus. Although our previous works have revealed that female sex hormones, particularly estrogen, play pivotal roles in suppressing maternal B-lymphopoiesis, the precise molecular mechanisms that mediate their functions are largely unknown. Because T and B lymphocytes function coordinately in the adaptive immune system, the inhibition of B-lymphopoiesis during pregnancy should be involved, at least in part, in \u201cmaternal-fetal immune tolerance.\u201d Understanding the molecular mechanisms of tolerance would contribute to the development of new methods to inhibit immune responses after organ transplantation, such as rejection by the host or graft-versus-host diseases. The goal of our present study is to identify the molecular pathways through which estrogen exerts its suppressive effect on B-lymphopoiesis. We performed global analyses of estrogen-inducible genes in bone marrow (BM) stromal cells and identified the secreted frizzled-related protein (sFRP) family. A sFRP1-immunoglobulin G (Ig) fusion protein inhibited early differentiation of B-cells originating from BM-derived hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) in culture (Yokota T. et al. Journal of Immunol, 2008). Conversely, sFRP1 deficiency in vivo caused dysregulation of HSPC homeostasis in BM and aberrant increase of peripheral B lymphocytes (Renstr\u00f6m J. et al. Cell Stem Cell, 2009). Therefore, in the present study we generated sFRP1 transgenic chimera (TC) mice that produced high levels of circulating sFRP1 after birth to examine the influence of sFRP1 on adult lymphopoiesis in vivo. Further, we generated sFRP5 TC mice using the same procedure to determine whether there were functional differences or redundancies between sFRP1 and sFRP5. The two are most closely related isoforms among the sFRP family and are known to play redundant roles during embryonic development; however, their physiological function in the immune system is largely unknown. Unexpectedly, while only subtle change was detected in the lymphoid lineage of sFRP1 TC mice, we found that the number of B cells was significantly reduced in the sFRP5 TC mice. The frequency of B cells, which normally account for approximately 50% of peripheral leukocytes of wild-type (WT) mice, was reduced to less than 20% in the sFRP5 TC mice. The suppression was likely specific to the B lineage, because overexpression of sFRP5 did not affect myeloid, T, or NK cells. Compared with WT littermates, the body size of sFRP5 TC mice was slightly, but significantly smaller. Thymocyte counts were not affected. In contrast, the number of splenocytes, particularly those of the B lineage, significantly decreased. In BM of sFRP5 TC mice, early B-cell differentiation was inhibited, resulting in the accumulation of cells whose phenotype corresponds to those of common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs). Gene array analyses of the accumulated CLPs indicated that sFRP5 affects the expression of adaptive immune system-related genes. Further, the sFRP5 overexpression was found to induce the expression of Wnt and Notch-related molecules that regulate the integrity of HSPCs. To determine the physiological involvement of sFRP5 in the inhibition of early B-cell differentiation, we exploited mice lacking sFRP5. It is noteworthy that, although the level of sFRP5 expression was minimal in steady-state BM, it was markedly induced after estrogen treatment. We injected water-soluble \u03b2-estradiol into WT or sFRP5-null mice for 4 days and evaluated their lympho-hematopoiesis 12 h after the last injection. While the highly HSPC-enriched Lineage - Sca-1 + c-kit Hi Flt3 - fraction of WT mice was resistant to the treatment, the same fraction of sFRP5-null mice showed a declining trend. Further, although the CLP fraction was significantly reduced in both strains, CLPs of sFRP5-null mice were more sensitive to estrogen than those of WT. We also performed gene expression analyses of WT and sFRP5-null mice after the estrogen treatment. We found that estrogen induced the expression of Hes1 in HSPCs of WT but not sFRP5-null mice. Thus, we conclude that estrogen-inducible sFRP5 blocks the differentiation of HSPCs in BM to B-lymphocytes in the presence of high levels of estrogen, at least in part by activation of the Notch pathway.
