    "abstract_text": "Abstract 504 Background: There is limited data on the outcomes of AHCT for MM as a salvage approach following relapse after an initial (upfront) AHCT. We analyzed the outcomes of second salvage AHCT for relapsed MM. Methods: From the CIBMTR database we identified 187 patients (63% male) who had second AHCT (AHCT2) as salvage for MM relapsing after a prior AHCT (AHCT1). Planned tandem AHCT and AHCT2 within 6 months after AHCT1 were excluded. Cumulative incidence of relapse, non-relapse mortality (NRM) and the probabilities of progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed and multivariate analysis performed using proportional hazards models. Results: Median age at transplant was 57 (range 28\u201372) and 59 years (range 28\u201374) respectively at AHCT1 and AHCT2 respectively. Median follow up after AHCT2 was 47 months (range: 3\u201397). The proportion of IgG, IgA and free light chain subtypes was 48, 20 and 18% respectively. Durie Salmon stage at diagnosis was stage I (6%), II (21%), III (59%) respectively. Seven and 13% had serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl at AHCT1 and AHCT2 respectively. Conditioning regimen was single agent melphalan was in 78% and 84% for AHCT1 and AHCT2 respectively. At the time of AHCT2, majority (60%) were chemotherapy resistant compared with 80% patients with sensitive disease prior to AHCT1. Median time from AHCT1 to relapse was 18 months, with 32% relapsing within the first year, 29% in the second year, 19% in the third year and 19% beyond the third year after AHCT1. There was heterogeneity in the time to AHCT2 after relapse although 67% had AHCT2 within a year after relapse (median 7 months). Median between AHCT1 and AHCT2 was 32 months with the majority (69%) beyond 24 months. After AHCT2, day 28 engraftment rates of neutrophils and platelets were 96% (95% CI: 93\u201398) and 88% (95% CI: 83\u201392). Complete remission (CR) rates after AHCT1 were 43% whereas it was only 25% following AHCT2. After AHCT2, cumulative incidence of relapse at 1, 3 and 5 years was 51, 82, and 91% respectively. After AHCT2, one year NRM was 2%. PFS was 47%, 13% and 5% and OS was 83%, 46% and 29% at 1, 3 and 5 years respectively. In multivariate analysis, those relapsing within 36 months of AHCT1 had a higher risk of relapse (HR 1.58, p = 0.036) and higher risk of treatment failure and inferior PFS (HR1.52, p= 0.04). Mortality was higher for those relapsing early after AHCT1 (<36 months, HR 1.91, p = 0.02). OS was superior and mortality lower for AHCT2 performed after 2004-08 (HR 0.61, p=0.02). Conclusion: AHCT2 can be safely performed in relapsed MM with the best outcomes observed in later relapses (>36 months from AHCT1). OS has improved since 2004, but NRM, relapse and PFS after AHCT2 were not impacted by year of AHCT2. Thus the improved OS likely reflects greater availability of novel agents for post AHCT progression.  Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
