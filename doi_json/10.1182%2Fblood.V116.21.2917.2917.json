    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2917 Background: The European LeukemiaNet MDS (EUMDS) registry is designed to collect information about the demographics and disease-management of newly diagnosed low-risk and intermediate-1 risk MDS patients. From April 2008 until July 2010, 828 patients have been registered in eleven participating countries through a web-based reporting system. Objectives: This report describes the disease-management of the first 800 registered patients, including transfusion-related issues like secondary iron overload and its treatment. Results: 159 of 800 patients (20%) started MDS specific treatment within three months before registration; this percentage increased to 50% at 18 months of follow-up. Most patients received erythroid-stimulating agents (ESA), like erythropoietin ( Table 1 ). In patients with a clinical indication for ESA, the percentage of transfusion-independency was similar to the transfusion-independent group without indication for ESA at 18 months of follow-up ( Table 1 ). Overall, 27% of the patients received blood transfusions at registration. This percentage remained stable during follow-up, probably due to the therapeutic effect of ESA ( Table 1 ). The number of units transfused, per 6 months, in these patients increased from 5 to 13 units at 18 months of follow-up, with a mean pre-transfusion Hb level of 7.6 g/dL. The serum ferritin levels of the transfusion-dependent patients at registration were available in 159 patients. The serum ferritin level at registration was \u22652000 \u03bcg/L in 4% of the patients who received a mean number of 10 units (SD 7). This increased to 28% of the patients who received a mean number of 20 units (SD 11) at 18 months of follow-up. The percentage of patients on iron chelation therapy increased from 1% to 9% during follow-up ( Table 1 ). In these patients the mean serum ferritin levels remained stable: 1913 \u03bcg/L (SD 1183) at registration and 1626 \u03bcg/L (SD 1232) at 18 months of follow-up. In contrast, transfusion-dependent patients not treated with iron chelation or ESA had increasing ferritin levels, with a mean ferritin of 630 \u03bcg/L (SD 597) at registration and 1586 \u03bcg/L (SD 1017) at 18 months of follow-up. 37 patients (5%) progressed to high-risk MDS or acute myeloblastic leukemia at a median of 155 days from registration. 62 patients (8%) have died within a median of 269 days from registration, 32 deaths were MDS related. The overall survival was 93% at 18 months of follow-up, with a progression-free survival of 90%. Differences in overall survival between transfusion-independent and transfusion-dependent patients were significant: 97% versus 85%, respectively (p<0.0001; Table 2 ). In the multivariate analysis transfusion-dependency, ferritin levels and IPSS score predicted survival ( Table 2 ). The IPSS score had a significant prognostic impact on overall survival and progression-free survival in contrast to the WHO classification (Data not shown). Conclusions: Despite a high transfusion load the mean serum ferritin levels remained stable during treatment with iron chelation. Transfusion-dependent patients had a worse overall survival and progression-free survival with higher ferritin levels and higher IPSS score as compared to transfusion-independent patients. This report demonstrates the importance of detailed disease-management in low- and intermediate-1 risk MDS patients. Table 1 Disease-Management over Time  . Registration .
