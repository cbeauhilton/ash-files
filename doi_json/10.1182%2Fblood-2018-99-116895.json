    "abstract_text": "Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), a TEC-family non-receptor tyrosine kinase, plays a critical role in B-cell development and function. Targeting of BTK with covalent inhibitors like ibrutinib has become a standard approach for many B-cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). Yet, many patients demonstrate intrinsic or acquired resistance to covalent BTK inhibition. The prognosis of patients who relapse after ibrutinib treatment for MCL or CLL is dismal, highlighting the urgent need for new approaches that overcome resistance to current BTK inhibitors. We hypothesized that degradation of BTK could be a better alternative to inhibition alone, as it would both: 1) maintain efficacy in cells harboring the ibrutinib-resistant BTK C418S mutation and 2) target non-catalytic functions of BTK. To address this, we turned to a small molecule-mediated protein degradation platform that utilizes an E3 ligase-targeting moiety linked to the ligand of a target of interest, so that the target can be marked for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. We previously showed that BTK is one of the most robustly degraded kinase targets using a nonspecific kinase inhibitor linked to a imide-based core followed by agnostic proteomics. We synthesized highly potent and selective degraders of BTK using imides as a base. To do so, the parent BTK inhibitor CGI1746 was linked to thalidomide using either polyethylene glycol (DD-03-007) linkers or saturated hydrocarbon chain (DD-03-171) linkers. After verifying that these degraders induce dimerization of BTK and CRBN and penetrate cells, we explored the pharmacological effects in vitro . Both DD-03-007 and DD-03-171 reduced BTK levels at concentrations as low as 40 nM within 4h of treatment. Furthermore, cellular BTK levels remained low for 24h after washout, showing that these degraders are capable of sustaining depletion of BTK for an extended period of time (Figure). DD-03-007 and DD-03-171 are both ligase and proteasome-dependent, as shown by co-treatment with bortezomib or MLN-4924 as well as competition experiments with lenalidomide or CGI-1746. Moreover, the degraders exhibited strong synergy with the HCK inhibitor A419259, suggesting that it would be possible to recapitulate ibrutinib's previously reported polypharmacology with an HCK inhibitor. We overexpressed wild-type or C481S BTK in TMD-8 cells and ran an antiproliferation assay, which showed that DD-03-007 overcame ibrutinib resistance associated with BTK C481S mutation. Next, we explored the effects of the degraders in MCL specifically. Proteomic analysis showed that DD-03-171 is a triple-degrader, as it degrades BTK but retains degradation activity on IKZF1 and IKZF3. Finally, we performed In vivo efficacy studies in cell line and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of MCL. The latter was obtained from a patient who had progressed on ibrutinib. In both models, DD-03-171 caused a significant reduction in tumor burden at an early timepoint. DD-03-171 also markedly extended survival compared to treatment with ibrutinib or lenalidomide alone (Figure). In conclusion, we developed highly potent and selective BTK degraders with activity in vivo against human MCL that induce the degradation of multiple factors essential for MCL survival. Figure.
