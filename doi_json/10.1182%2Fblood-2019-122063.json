    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is a CD19+ B-cell malignancy that accounts for approximately 25% of adult leukemia diagnoses in the developed world. While conventional therapies have some efficacy, there are few curative therapeutic options and many patients ultimately progress to relapsed or refractory disease. CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has provided some hope, but induces complete remission in only 26% of patients. This suboptimal response rate is believed to be due to T cell dysfunction and immune-suppression by CLL cells, the mechanisms of which are poorly understood. Results: To understand the causes of CAR T cell dysfunction in CLL we investigated the defects that CLL cells induced in normal donor CD19-targeting CAR T cells. CAR T cells were repeatedly stimulated at 5-day intervals with either primary CLL cells from patients or a CD19-expressing control cell line (aAPC). Repeat stimulation of CAR T cells with aAPCs resulted in 5.36 \u00b1 .94 population doublings after three stimulations, whereas CLL cells only evoked 2.39 \u00b1 .92 population doublings. We performed phenotyping, proliferation analysis, and cytokine analysis of stimulated CAR T cells. CLL-stimulated T cells appeared un-activated, with low levels of PD-1, LAG3, and TIM3, low levels of cytokine production, and a high proportion of non-cycling cells as measured by Ki67 staining. We first hypothesized that CLL cells induce an altered epigenetic program that prevents effector function and is stabilized by successive stimulations. To test this, we stimulated CAR T cells with CLL cells or aAPCs as indicated in Fig. 1A . CLL-stimulated CAR T cells failed to proliferate or produce cytokines, but subsequent stimulation with aAPCs rescued these functions ( Fig. 1B ). Further, CLL-stimulated CAR T cells did not differentiate, suggesting that CLL cells do not induce stable defects but rather insufficiently activate CAR T cells ( Fig. 1C ). These cells also appeared un-activated as indicated by low levels of PD-1 and Ki67. We then used flow cytometry to assess expression of costimulatory and inhibitory molecules on the primary CLL samples. We found that the levels of co-stimulatory and adhesion molecules, namely CD80/CD86 and CD54/CD58 respectively were found at low frequencies, and where present were expressed at low levels. This suggested that one mechanism behind the lack of CAR T cell effector responses may be that a lack of co-stimulation prevents proper CAR T cell targeting of these cells. Towards this, we incubated CLL cells with a murine fibroblast line expressing CD40 ligand for 24 hours with IL-4 to activate the CLL cells. We found that this activation significantly increased expression of CD80, CD86, CD54, and CD58 on the CLL cells. We then used these cells to stimulate CAR T cells in our re-stimulation assay and found that CAR T cells were able to proliferate in response to these activated CLLs ( Fig. 1D ). In addition, CAR T cells stimulated with activated CLL cells formed more cell-to-cell conjugates than those stimulated with un-activated CLL cells. These data suggest not only that insufficient activation of CAR T cells may be responsible for the poor response rates to CAR T cell therapy in CLL, but also implicate a need for additional co-stimulation in this CAR T cell setting. Another contributing factor may be immune suppression by CLL cells. To determine if CLL cells are immune-suppressive, we used a co-culture assay to stimulate CAR T cells with aAPCs and CLL cells mixed at known ratios. Interestingly, all mixed cultures proliferated similarly, suggesting that CLL cells did not prevent T cell activation in the presence of a strong activation signal. We also found that CLL cells are responsive to IL-2, as addition of this cytokine to culture media prolongs survival of CLL cells out to 10 days depending on the dose. This suggests that CLL cells express a functional IL-2 receptor and may be taking up IL-2 from the culture media, further impairing T cell activation. In support of this, supplementing IL-2 into our CLL/CAR T cell co-cultures rescued T cell proliferative capacity. Taken together, these data suggest that T cell dysfunction in CLL is the result of insufficient activation rather than true functional defects.
