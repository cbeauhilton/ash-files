The aim of our study was to prospectively investigate the association among PET-2 results and TARC serum levels (T) in HL and the prognostic role of T in disease relapse or progression. Patients and Methods Between November 2006 and June 2009, T was measured by ELISA in 73 pts: 50 newly diagnosed untreated pts (Group U) and 23 pts relapsing or progressing after first line CT\u00b1RT (Group S). Group U pts received stage-directed therapy consisting in 4 ABVD cycles followed by IFRT for stage I-II A, and 6-8 ABVD cycles \u00b1 RT on bulky sites of disease for stage II B, III-IV. Group S pts received cytoreductive CT with Ifosfamide-containing regimens followed by HDBEAM+ASCT. T evaluation was repeated after each CT cycle, at the end of treatment and during follow-up. Results Main pts characteristics were as follows: males/females: 32/41; age3/\u22643 involved sites: 34/39; IPS>2/\u22642: 8/65. Basal T (T0) (median, IQ range) was significantly higher in Group U vs S (23540, 6528-50710 vs 1448, 735-8278; Mann-Whitney test P=0.002); T0 values >536 were observed in 43 (86%) Group U pts and 18 (78%) Group S pts (536 was the 95 th centile of T distribution in a group of 40 independent healthy subjects). Pts with NS, bulky disease and extranodal involvement had significantly higher T0 levels than their counterparts. After 2 CT cycles, T (T2) was significantly lower than T0 in Group U (Wilcoxon paired sample test P536 were observed in 18 (36%) Group U pts and 14 (61%) Group S pts. PET-2 scan was positive in 20 pts (27%) (Group U: 18%, Group S: 48%); PET- 2 was positive in 19/61 pts (31%) with T0 >536 and in 1/12 pts (8%) with T0 \u2264 536; in 17/32 (53%) pts with T2 >536 and in 2/35 (6%) pts with T2 \u2264 536. The chance of having a positive PET-2 was similar in pts with T0 >536 and T2 \u2264 536 compared with pts with T0 \u2264 536 (OR: 1.1; 95% CI: 0.9-13.5), whereas it was 13-fold greater in pts with both T0 and T2 >536 (OR: 12.6; 95% CI 1.4-110). Median follow-up was 18 months (interquartile range: 13-25 months); 13 (18%) pts had relapse or progression (7 Group U, 6 Group S), 24-months progression-free survival (PFS) was 83.4% in Group U and 60.6% in Group S. PFS was 100% vs 78.6% vs 59.4% in pts with T0 \u2264 536, T0 >536 and T2 \u2264 563, and both T0 and T2 >536, respectively. Conclusions Our study confirms that HL pts have increased serum TARC values at baseline compared with healthy subjects; moreover T0 combined with values observed after 2 cycles of CT may have a role in predicting PET-2 results and disease outcome.
