    "abstract_text": "We have developed a new class of direct thrombin inhibitors (VE-DTIs) that act through reversible covalent enzyme inhibition. These compounds inhibit thrombin with high potency (IC 50 < 10 nM) and with better than 100\u00d7 selectivity against related serine proteases. In rodents, VE-DTIs show dose-dependent efficacy in preventing arterial and venous thromboses respectively in arteriovenous shunt thrombosis and venous stasis thrombosis models. They also prevent thrombin-induced pulmonary embolism in rodents. Despite their strong anticoagulation properties, VE-DTIs are associated with significantly lower bleeding times than other approved anticoagulants dabigatran, argatroban or apixaban in rodent bleeding models (tail bleeding time and saphenous vein bleeding time). We compared the effect of VE-DTIs and the DTIs argatroban and dabigatran on the coagulation cascade. In vitro, VE-DTIs inhibited thrombin-mediated fibrinogen cleavage with similar potency. Inhibition of thrombin/thrombomodulin complex-mediated activation of TAFI and protein C by VE-DTIs were also comparable. In contrast, VE-DTIs were more than 1000-fold less potent in inhibiting thrombin-mediated platelet activation than the other DTIs. Additionally, and also in contrast to argatroban and dabigatran, VE-DTIs protect rodents from the effects of thrombin-induced pulmonary embolism without significantly inhibiting platelet activation. The ability of VE-DTIs to prevent thrombosis without significantly impacting platelet function could lead to a new anticoagulant therapy with lower bleeding risk.
