    "abstract_text": "Fluorescent cell barcoding (FCB) is a high-throughput multiplexing technique, in which samples from one or more donors can be combined, minimizing staining variability, antibody consumption, and decreasing sample volumes needed. In this study, we optimized FCB technique for routine application in immunophenotyping, phosphoFlow, and intracellular cytokine detection. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy controls and patients were used for optimization, and CBD450 and CBD500, Pacific Orange succinimidyl ester, DyLight 350, and DyLight 800 were tested for barcoding 6 to 36 samples. Working concentrations ranging from 0 to 125 \u00b5g/mL were tested, and viability dye staining was also optimized to increase data robustness. We first measured fluorescence intensity (MFIs) of six serial dilutions (0, 0.75, 3.25, 12.5, 62.5 and 125 \u00b5g/mL) and the difference in intensity separating them. Second, a 3x3 matrix was prepared using three concentrations of two different dyes, and PMBCs were barcoded with nine different combinations of FCB dye concentrations. When gated with the dyes, nine lymphocyte populations were detected. A 4x(3x3) matrix was also designed using three different FCB dyes (CBD450, DyLight 800, and Pacific Orange) at various concentrations to barcode 36 samples simultaneously. Thus, each lymphocyte population was clearly identified. The separation of each population or purity of deconvolution is based on the distance between MFIs and CVs. When we calculated the purity of deconvolution in our experiments, human PBMCs displayed CVs of 10 - 25%. When MFIs were separated by 2-fold increase, barcoded populations could be identified with a good resolution, higher when MFIs were separated by 3- or more fold increase. The use of viability dyes as LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua viability dye together with the FCB showed increase of data robustness due to exclusion of dead cells from gating strategy. In combination with viability dye, we successfully performed a six-color phosphoFlow and a simple four-color stainings using the same FCB dye combinations and cytometer voltages, and also combining one healthy control and two different patient samples. Our methods using FCB dye alone and/or in combination with antibody staining should be useful to efficiently perform multiplex drug screening and lymphocyte characterization. FCB minimizes batches and technical variations, and also increases data robustness, thus improving the immune phenotyping of patients. Disclosures Young: GSK/Novartis: Research Funding.",
