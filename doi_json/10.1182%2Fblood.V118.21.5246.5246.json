However, the relationship between inflammation and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is not completely understood. Conflicting reports have been published about the levels of proteins involved in the inflammatory response in the context of DVT. Changes in ADAMTS13 levels have been reported in other inflammatory conditions such as sepsis, and this protease could be involved in the interplay between hemostasis and inflammation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate ADAMTS13 activity in DVT patients and its association with inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-8, CRP, TNF-\u03b1), D-dimer and von Willebrand Factor (VWF) levels. METHODOLOGY: Thirty-eight DVT patients, from 6 months to five years after the diagnosis of DVT, followed at the outpatient unit of thrombotic diseases from University of Campinas and 38 healthy volunteers selected as controls were included in the study. ADAMTS13 activity was determined by the residual binding of VWF to collagen. VWF, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha levels were determined by ELISA, and D-dimer levels was determined by a turbidimetric method. RESULTS: In this study population DVT was triggered by transient risk factors, particularly the use of oral contraceptives. No patient presented renal, hepatic or malignant disease. Median ADAMTS13 activity was not statistically different between patients (median: 98.2%; range: 70\u2013146) and controls (median: 96.1%; range: 66\u2013117; p=0.35). IL-6 and TNF-alfa levels were also higher in patients (median: 1.0pg/mL and 2.3pg/mL) compared to controls (median: 0.64pg/mL and 1.7pg/mL, p=0,01 and p=0,009). In addition, VWF and D-dimer levels were also significantly higher in patients (all P<0.01). No significant difference could be demonstrated between IL-8 and CRP levels from patients and controls. No significant correlation between ADAMTS13 levels and other inflammatory markers could be demonstrated. VWF levels correlated significantly with IL-8 (r=-0.4635, p< 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study reinforces the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of DVT. The correlation of VWF and IL-8 supports the notion that IL-8 stimulates the secretion of VWF. The role of ADAMTS13 in the context of DVT is yet to be determined. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
