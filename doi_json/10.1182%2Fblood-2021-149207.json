    "abstract_text": "Background In addition to its influence on survival, leukocytosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) has also been implicated as a risk factor for thrombosis, including venous thrombosis in PV ( Blood Cancer J, 2017;7:662 ) and arterial thrombosis in ET ( Blood. 2011;117:5857). In the current study, we sought to clarify the individual prognostic contribution of absolute neutrophil (ANC), lymphocyte (ALC) and monocyte (AMC) counts, for arterial and venous thrombotic events in essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV). Methods The current study included 487 patients with ET (n=349) or PV (n=138), recruited from the Mayo Clinic MPN database, based on availability of information on ANC, ALC and AMC. Conventional criteria were used for diagnosis ( Blood 2016;127:2391 ) and definitions of major vascular events ( Blood Cancer J. 2018;8:25) . Conventional statistical models were applied using JMP Pro 14.0.0 software package, SAS Institute, Cary, NC. Multivariable analyses included previously established risk factors for arterial or venous thrombosis. Results Essential thrombocythemia patients: 349 patients (median age 57 years, range 18-89; females 61%) with ET were included in the study: 46% JAK2 , 34% CALR , 16% triple-negative and 4% MPL mutated; IPSET risk category high 24%, intermediate 41%, and low 35%; presenting median (range) values were 13.8 g/dL (11.1-16.4) for hemoglobin, 8.2 x 10(9)/L (3.2-52) for leukocyte count, and 859 x 10(9)/L (451-3460) for platelet count; palpable splenomegaly was present in 48 (14%) patients and cardiovascular risk factors in 56%; median follow-up was 10 years (range 0-47). There were 38 (11%) documented venous events at diagnosis and 31 (9%) after diagnosis and 42 (12%) arterial events at diagnosis and 64 (18%) after diagnosis. Polycythemia vera patients : 138 patients (median age 62 years, range 20-94; females 50%) with PV were included in the study; presenting median (range) values were 17.9 g/dL (16.1-24) for hemoglobin, 11.8 x 10(9)/L (2.7-65.8) for leukocyte count, and 434 x 10(9)/L (44-1679) for platelet count; 57% of patients presented with leukocytosis >11 x 10(9)/L; palpable splenomegaly was present in 37 (27%) patients; abnormal karyotype was documented in 17% of patients. Median follow-up was 11 years (range 0.03-36.7). There were 22 (16%) documented venous events at diagnosis and 21 (16%) after diagnosis and 28 (20%) arterial events at diagnosis and 15 (11%) after diagnosis. ANC/ALC/AMC associations with thrombosis in ET and PV: In both ET and PV, ANC/ALC/AMC did not correlate with arterial thrombosis at/prior to diagnosis (p>0.1 in all instances). By contrast, in both ET and PV, higher ANC (p=0.05 and 0.04, respectively) and higher AMC (p=0.005 and 0.07), but not ALC (p=0.6 and 0.7), were correlated with venous thrombosis at/prior to diagnosis. Arterial thrombosis-free survival was not affected by ANC/ALC/AMC in either ET or PV (p>0.1 in all instances). By contrast, venous thrombosis-free survival in both ET and PV was compromised by higher ANC (p=0.05 and 0.003, respectively), but not ALC or AMC. The significant association between higher ANC and inferior venous thrombosis-free survival in both ET (p=0.01) and PV (p=0.007) was sustained during multivariable analysis that included history of venous thrombosis, age and sex; the only other variable of significance was older age in ET (p<0.001). The significant association between ANC and venous thrombosis-free survival was also noted in an external cohort of PV patients from the University of Florence (n=576). Conclusions : The current study identifies ANC as having a direct correlation with venous thrombosis in both ET and PV, independent of currently known risk factors. An additional risk contribution from AMC was apparent for events occuring at or prior to but not after diagnosis. Taken together, these observations flag both neutrophils and monocytes as potential contributors to venous but not arterial thrombosis in MPN, at least not by themselves. Additional collaborative studies are ongoing in order to integrate and reconcile our observations in the context of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (Carobbio et al) and JAK2V617F allele burden (Loscocco et al), on venous thrombosis-free survival in PV, reported in concomitantly submitted ASH 2021 abstracts, especially in light of the relatively small number of events in the current study.
