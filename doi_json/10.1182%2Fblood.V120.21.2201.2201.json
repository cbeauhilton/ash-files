    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2201 Idiopathic thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is typically associated with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency due to the production of autoantibodies against ADAMTS13. Recent studies have demonstrated that B cell activating factor (BAFF), a TNF family member known to promote activation and survival of autoreactive B cells, is increased in TTP patients (Thomas et al. 2011 155:620 Br J Haematol; Watanaboonyongcharoen et al. 2011, AABB Abstract # 1118421). We hypothesized that high BAFF levels in TTP results in loss of B cell tolerance and the production of autoantibodies. Since defective clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages has been found in autoimmune diseases, antibodies against MARCO (Macrophage Receptor with Collagenous structure) represented good candidate for study as a potentially pathophysiologically relevant autoantibody. Such anti-MARCO antibodies may lead to defective apoptotic cell clearance and the development of TTP. We measured anti-MARCO antibodies by ELISA and Western blot in 34 idiopathic TTP patients between 1999 and 2012: 25 female and 9 male with a median age of 40 years (range 25\u201372). All patients were diagnosed on the clinical basis of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia without any other cause. ADAMTS13 activity and the presence of anti-ADAMTS13 inhibitor tests were performed in all patients. Fifty percent of patients had ADAMTS13 activity less than 10%, while 56% had ADAMTS13 inhibitor. All 34 patients underwent therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) daily until the platelet count was at least 150 \u00d7 10 9 /l for two consecutive days. High dose steroids were initiated immediately after first TPE. While direct binding ELISA did not yield specific results due to high background, specific MARCO bands were detected by Western blotting of recombinant MARCO protein with patient plasma IgG. Ninety-seven percent of patients with TTP (33/34) were positive for anti-MARCO IgG antibody compared to forty percent (10/25) of healthy controls, p < 0.001 ( Table 1 ). As a surrogate for antibody titer, intensity of each Western blot band was quantified by densitometry using NIH ImageJ software. Patients with TTP had significantly increased anti-MARCO IgG as defined by the densitometric area under the curve (1.3 \u00d7 10 3 ; range 0\u20138.2 \u00d7 10 3 ) compared to healthy controls (0, range 0\u20134.5 \u00d7 10 3 ), p < 0.001. A cut-off point for high titer anti-MARCO IgG was calculated by using mean + 2SD of the area under the curve (AUC) of anti-MARCO IgG Western blot band density measured in healthy controls. Patients with an increased amount of anti-MARCO IgG (AUC > 2.9\u00d7 10 3 ) tended to have a higher relapse rate compared to those with normal anti-MARCO IgG (4 of 6 patients [67%] vs. 10 of 28 patients [36%], respectively, p = 0.20), although statistical significance was not reached due to the limited number of patients. Thus, for the first time, we identify anti-MARCO IgG in idiopathic TTP, suggesting a role for macrophage inhibition in the pathophysiology of TTP. Studies of anti-MARCO antibodies in larger numbers of patients may lead to development of a novel prognostic marker for TTP patients. Table 1.
