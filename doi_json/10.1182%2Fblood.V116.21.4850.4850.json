    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4850 Introduction: The WHO 2008 classification of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is based on morphology, cytogenetics and molecular features. Among them, mutations and internal tandem duplications of FLT3 in AML with a normal karyotype have been associated to a poor prognosis. Mutated NPM1 in the absence of FLT3-ITD is associated to a favorable. On the other hand, variables of nuclear chromatin texture have been described as independent risk factors in several malignancies (ALL, melanoma and multiple myeloma). Aim: To compare the influence on overall survival of the chromatin fractal dimension and molecular features in adult patients with AML. Patients and Methods: We analyzed 106 consecutive cases diagnosed at our Institution between 2007 and 2009. Diagnosis was made by bone marrow (BM) cytology and karyotype, and cases were classified by WHO criteria. Genomic DNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform. Genotyping was made with the MegaBACE 1000 equipment and analyzed in the Fragment Profiler v1.2. For detection of the FLT3-TKD mutation, genomic DNA was amplified by PCR followed by restriction analysis. Blasts from the diagnostic BM cytology were digitalized, segmented and nuclear morphometric variables were examined. Their influence on overall survival was analyzed in the Cox model. Results: Median age: 52 years; peripheral blood (PB) leukocytes: 24.0\u00d710 9 /l (0.7-281.3). In the univariate analysis were significant: PB leukocyte count ( p =0.005), low-risk karyotype ( p =0.002), FLT3 ITD + ( p =0.002), FLT3 + NPM1 - ( p =0.029) and \u201cgoodness of fit\u201d (R 2 45) of the chromatin fractal dimension (Minkowski) (p=0.03). Age, fractal dimension and methylation status of p15 , p16 , p57 , p73 , ER and MDR1 were not significant. In the multivariate analyses including age, PB leukocytes, R 2 45 and mutations, high leukocyte counts (p=0.03) and low R 2 45 (p=0.01) were independent unfavorable and FLT3-NPM1 - ( p =0.04) and FLT3-NPM1 + ( p =0.02) were favorable prognostic variables. Conclusions: The blast chromatin texture measured by R 2 45 was an independent prognostic factor together with known risk variables in AML.
