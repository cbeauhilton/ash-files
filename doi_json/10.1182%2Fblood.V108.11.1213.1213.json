Monthly transfusions with a goal of maintaining sickle hemoglobin (HbS) 7 days after the scheduled date) occurring once in 22% and twice or more in 12% of children. The average pre-transfusion Hb was 9.0 \u00b1 0.7 gm/dL. The average pre-transfusion %HbS was 35 \u00b1 11 %, with a median %HbS value of 34%. Potential \"cutoff \" %HbS values for SWiTCH included 34% (50 th percentile of reported values), 43% (75 th percentile), and 52% HbS (90 th percentile). These data indicate that transfusions to prevent recurrent stroke vary among academic pediatric institutions and 30% HbS may not be a realistic goal for this study. Although the goal for transfusions in the SWiTCH standard treatment arm will remain 30% HbS, maintaining an average pre-transfusion HbS value of \u2264 45% will be required to reflect the academic community standard."
