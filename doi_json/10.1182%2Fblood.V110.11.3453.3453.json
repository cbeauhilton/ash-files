    "abstract_text": "Background: Belinostat (PXD101) is a hydroxamate pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor which demonstrates broad anti-neoplastic activity in vitro and in vivo. Phase I studies have shown that belinostat is well-tolerated. Methods: This Phase II trial evaluated the activity of belinostat in patients (pts) with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) who failed \u2265 1 prior systemic therapy. Belinostat (1000 mg/m 2 ) was administered as a 30-min IV infusion on Days 1\u20135 of a 3-wk cycle. The primary endpoint was objective response (OR) rate analyzed separately for PTCL and CTCL using the Cheson criteria and Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (SWAT), respectively. For each arm, a Simon 2-stage design was used based on target OR rate of 25%, with expansion to 34 pts if \u2265 2/13 OR were observed. Results: In the PTCL arm, 12 pts (9 with stage III/IV disease) were enrolled; (7 PTCL-unspecified (PTCL-U), 2 anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), 2 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and 1 NK-T-cell lymphoma), treated for a median of 2 cycles (range 1\u20138). Of 11 evaluable pts, 2 achieved a CR and 5 pts had SD. The two CR (11+ and 15+ wks) were both in pts with PTCL-U. A third pt with PTCL-U had SD lasting 14 wks and discontinued treatment due to an adverse event (AE). Both pts with ALCL had durable SD (20+ and 14 wks). In the CTCL arm, 16 pts were enrolled (9 Mycosis Fungoides (MF), 5 Sezary Syndrome (SS), 2 primary cutaneous ALCL) and treated for a median of 2 cycles (range 1\u20136). Four ORs were observed (25%): 1 CR (ALCL) and 3 PR (MF/SS). The median duration of the OR was 10 wks (range 7 to 39+ wks). Four additional pts had a 25 \u2013 50% decrease in SWAT. Improvement in pruritus score by \u2265 3 on a visual analog scale was reported in 5/6 patients with significant pruritus at baseline. Overall in both study arms the drug was well-tolerated and most AE were grade 1/2 (nausea, fatigue, constipation, diarrhea, and vomiting). Grade 3 AE attributed to the study drug was reported in 7 pts and included peripheral edema, apraxia, adynamic ileus, pruritus, rash, and infections. Only 1 treatment related Grade 4 AE was noted (thrombocytopenia). One patient with progressive PTCL died 6 days after last belinostat dose with ventricular fibrillation and drug causality could not be excluded. Conclusions: Belinostat (PXD101) is generally well tolerated and demonstrates encouraging clinical activity in recurrent or refractory PTCL and CTCL. The objective response rate in both arms has met the pre-defined criteria for study expansion to stage II of enrollment.",
