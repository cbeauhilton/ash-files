    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2186 Background and Aim: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) consist of short noncoding RNA molecules of approximately 18\u201322 nucleotide that regulate post-transcriptional gene expression by degradation or repression of mRNA molecules. The miR-17-92a cluster is known as a regulator of the immune system and is critical for lymphoid cellular development and tumorigenesis in lymphoid tissue. Most knowledge of the miR-17-92 cluster in normal and abnormal conditions of the lymphoid system is based on mouse experiments. It is suggested that the accumulation of activated CD4 + T cells by higher mir-17-92 expression leads to a breakdown of T-cell tolerance in the periphery and may promote B-cell activation, germinal center reaction and autoantibody generation. However, only limited reports on in vivo human lymphocyte senescence exist. We therefore set out to determine miR-92a levels in circulating lymphocytes obtained from healthy participants to ascertain the possible association between immunological condition and the expression level of miR-17-92. Experimental design: We separated lymphocytes from 21 healthy volunteers, aged 23 to 58 years (13 men and 8 women), for surface marker and miR-92a level analyses. The CD4 + or CD8 + T-cell fractions were separated with an isolation kit for humans (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and AutoMACS Pro Separator (Miltenyi Biotec), according to the supplier's instruction, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until utilization. After separation of CD4 + or CD8 + cells, the miR-92a levels were measure, as reported previously (PLoS ONE. 2011, 24;6(2);e16408). Immunophenotyping was done with flow cytometry. Results: The miR-92a of separated CD8 + lymphocytes decreased significantly with age ( P = 0.0002), and miR-92a in CD4 + cells tended to decrease with age ( P = 0.0635). We found a positive correlation between CD8 + miR-92a expression level and the percentage of naive CD8 + T cells (RO \u2212 CD8 + CD27 + cells ( P = 0.0046)) with L-selectin antigen (CD3 + CD8 + CD62L + ( P = 0.0011)) in healthy subjects. This suggests that the miR-92a of a majority of CD8 + T is derived from naive CD8 + T cells with L-selectin antigen, and CD8 + miR-92a expression level declines progressively with age ( P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001, respectively). In CD4 + cells, we observed a trend of decreasing CD4 + miR-92a level with age, while no significant difference was notable with lymphocyte subset fraction as far as we tested. The index of CD8 + miR-92a values (CD8 + miR-92a\u00d7number of CD8 cells) was positively correlated with the index of CD4 + miR-92a values ( P = 0.0101). Discussion: These results indicate an age-related reduction of naive T cells may link to miR-92a of T-lymphocytes and may influence immune dysfuction with age. In conclusion, our results suggest that the miR-92a level may represent attrition of nai\u0308ve CD8 + T cells, possibly due to apoptosis of nai\u0308ve T cells. Additionally down-regulation of the miR-92a level in individuals older than 40 years may indicate impairment or exhaustion of nai\u0308ve T-cells linked to immune dysfunction and contributed disease states.
