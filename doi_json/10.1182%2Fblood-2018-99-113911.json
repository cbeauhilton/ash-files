    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Leukemic escape from the graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is poorly understood. During prolonged periods of post-transplant remission, immunologic selection pressure can favor relapse mediated by acquired resistance to GVL-mediated clearance, such as loss of mismatched HLA in haploidentical transplants. We hypothesized that genetic mechanisms of immune evasion can cause late relapses after matched unrelated donor transplants for myeloid malignancies. Methods: We evaluated 580 adult patients with myeloid malignancies who underwent allogeneic HCT at our institution between 2001 and 2014 and experienced subsequent disease relapse. In 19% of these patients (n=112) relapse occurred at least one year after transplantation. The 25 patients included in the study had specimens banked at each of three timepoints: 1) prior to transplantation, with AML or MDS involvement, 2) approximately 100 days after transplantation, during the period of remission 3) at the time of disease relapse. The indications for transplantation were AML (n = 20) and MDS (n = 5). Transplants were from matched unrelated (n=14), matched related (n=9), and mismatched unrelated (n=2) donors. 12 patients received myeloablative conditioning and 13 received reduced-intensity conditioning regimens. Targeted sequencing of 187 genes, selected based on pathogenic involvement in myeloid malignancies or suspected involvement in immune evasion, was performed on all three timepoints from each patient. Genome-wide microarray-based copy number assessment was performed onthe pre-transplant specimen and post-transplant relapse specimens. Results: We identified three recipients with relapse-specific HLA loss via 1-8 Mb deletions or chromosome 6p arm-level copy neutral uniparental disomy (UPD). One of the HLA alterations was a deletion spanning HLA-B and HLA-C in a donor/recipient pair mismatched at HLA-C . However, in two other cases, relapse-specific HLA losses were identified in donor/recipient pairs that were fully matched at A, B, C, and DRB1. These findings suggest that HLA loss may allow leukemic cells to escape allogeneic immune recognition of minor HLA discrepancies and/or the presentation of minor histocompatibility antigens in the context of matched MHC presentation. These three HLA losses were identified among 14 recipients of matched unrelated donor HCT. HLA losses were not identified among recipients of matched related (n = 9) or mismatched unrelated (n = 2) allogeneic HCT. To evaluate potential interactions between canonical myeloid driver mutations and immunologic alterations, we defined the genetic characteristics of paired pre-transplant MDS/AML samples and post-transplant relapsed samples. In 22 out of 25 cases, at least one driver mutation that was present in the pre-transplant sample was also detected in the relapse sample. Clonal genetic evolution was common at the time of relapse and predominantly involved the acquisition of new subclonal mutations affecting mitogenic signaling (n = 9) and myeloid transcription factors (n = 11). TP53 alterations, including point mutations and 17p deletions were identified in 6 out of 25 patients, including two that remained stable before and after transplantation, and four that were newly detected at the time of relapse. Conclusions: We identified recurrent HLA loss via 6p UPD and segmental deletions in 3 out of 14 patients with late relapse after matched unrelated HCT. Although HLA loss has been observed at relapse after haploidentical HCT, the role of HLA loss as a mechanism of relapse after non-haploidentical HCT has remained unclear. HLA loss in cases with late relapse indicates a prolonged period of immunologic equilibrium, where effective GVL serves as a selective pressure for clonal genetic mechanisms of alloimmune evasion. In the context of MURD HCT, HLA loss provides genetic evidence that allogeneic immune recognition may be mediated by minor histocompatibility antigens and suggests opportunities for novel immunologic approaches for relapse prevention.
