    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4547 Targeted cancer therapies for hematological malignancies have rapidly gained uptake in different types of indications, and some have become gold standard of treatment. However, the high cost of these therapies poses challenges for payers, patients and physicians. Methods To understand the cost-effectiveness of these new classes of drugs we reviewed the published cost-effectiveness studies and analyzed their cost/QALY, time horizon, comparators, indications and model approaches. Results Targeted therapies for hematological cancers have much lower and less variable cost/QALY than branded drugs indicated for solid tumors. For example, incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) for imatinib ranges from $40,000 to $45,000/QALY, while ICER for bevacizumab ranges from $125,000 to $325,000/QALY. Secondly, the choice of comparator in some occasions may depend on the country of use, therefore models are required to be customized to local regimens. In one of the cost-effectiveness analysis for bortezomib for refractory multiple myeloma patients, NICE questioned the use of high dose dexamethasone (HDD) as comparator. Third, there is also some variability in methods used by different manufacturers, some used cost/QALY whereas others used cost/LYG. Conclusion: This analysis shows the range, variability and methods used for calculation of ICER values for these targeted cancer therapies and provides lessons for executives and policy makers.
