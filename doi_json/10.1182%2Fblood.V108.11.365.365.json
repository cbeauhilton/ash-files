    "abstract_text": "Binding of EKLF to the proximal promoter CACC motif is essential for high-level tissue-specific \u03b2-globin gene expression. More recent studies have demonstrated that EKLF regulates expression of other erythroid-specific genes, suggesting a broad role for EKLF in co-ordinating gene transcription in differentiating erythroblasts. Given these observations, we hypothesized that EKLF may play a role in synchronizing \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin gene expression. Supporting this model, studies of fetal erythroblasts derived from EKLF-null embryos revealed a 3-fold reduction in murine \u03b1-globin gene expression in fetal erythroblasts when compared to wild type littermate controls. A similar reduction in primary \u03b1-globin RNA transcripts was observed in these studies. To further examine the molecular consequences of EKLF function at the \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin genes in vivo , we utilized an erythroid cell line derived from EKLF null fetal liver cells. We have demonstrated previously that introduction into these cells of the wildtype EKLF cDNA, fused in frame with a mutant estrogen response element results in tamoxifen-dependent rescue of \u03b2-globin gene expression. Consistent with our observations in primary erythroblasts, \u03b1-globin gene expression is present in the absence of functional EKLF. However, with tamoxifen induction, we observed a 3\u20135 fold increase in \u03b1-globin gene transcription. Interestingly, the kinetics of the changes in transcription of the \u03b1- and \u03b2-gene transcripts were similar. Enhancement in \u03b1-gene transcription was associated with EKLF binding at the \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin promoters as determined by a quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Interestingly, maximal EKLF binding and \u03b1-gene transcription was observed within 2 hours of tamoxifen induction. We hypothesized that the role of EKLF may differ function at the promoters, given that a basal level of \u03b1-globin gene expression occurs in absence of EKLF binding. Supporting this hypothesis, we observed sequential recruitment of p45NF-E2, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and the co-activator CBP to the \u03b2-promoter with tamoxifen induction. No change in GATA-1 binding was observed. In contrast, p45NF-E2 does not bind to the \u03b1-promoter and the kinetics of GATA-1 and PolII association is unchanged after tamoxifen induction. Taken together, our results demonstrate that EKLF regulates the co-ordinate high-level transcription of the \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin genes, binding in a kinetically identical manner to the gene promoters. However, the effects of EKLF on transacting factor recruitment (and chromatin modification) differ between the promoters, consistent with the idea that EKLF acts in a context-specific manner to modulate gene transcription.",
