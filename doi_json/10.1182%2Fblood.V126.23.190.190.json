    "abstract_text": "Background. In the last decade major advances have been made in the management of AL amyloidosis, such as the use of free light chains (FLC) and cardiac biomarkers in diagnosis, risk assessment, and evaluation of response, and the introduction of novel agents in the therapeutic armamentarium. However, available studies on the natural history of this disease are based on data collected before this era, and large comparative studies on novel agents are still lacking. We report the outcome of the 984 consecutive patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2014 at the Pavia Amyloidosis Research and Treatment Center (ARCT). Methods. Baseline evaluation and therapeutic strategy were protocolized. Patients were prospectively followed for response and survival. Response was assessed by intent to treat. Results. Overall, the heart was involved in 76% (Mayo stage III 39%), the kidney in 66% (stage III 15%), the liver in 14%, the soft tissues in 17%, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) in 12%. Isolated involvement of the heart or kidney was observed in 17% and 14% of cases, respectively, while the liver or PNS were the only organs involved in 180 mg/L) was associated with poorer survival in stage II patients treated with MDex (38% vs. 68% at 3 years, P<0.001) and CyBorD (50% vs. 70% at 3 years, P=0.033), but not in subjects treated with BMDex (67% vs. 70% at 3 years, P=0.401). Conclusion. The outcome of patients with AL amyloidosis is extremely heterogeneous, but can be accurately predicted based on biomarkers of organ damage and FLC concentration. The extensive use of upfront bortezomib prolongs the duration of response, but does not translate in a general improvement of survival. This might be due to the fact that most patients refractory to or relapsed after MDex were rescued with bortezomib. However, accurate stratification reveals subgroups of patients in whom bortezomib combinations are most effective. In stage Ib patients bortezomib triplets grant the best outcome, while the combination of bortezomib, melphalan, and dexamethasone should be preferred in subjects with moderate cardiac dysfunction and elevated FLC burden.
