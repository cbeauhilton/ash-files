    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4865 Background: Patients who relapse with CD20 + B-NHL and B cell lymphoblastic leukemia (B-LL) have a dismal prognosis, often associated with chemotherapy resistance (Cairo et al. JCO, 2012,Mils/Cairo et al. BJH,2012) and often require alternative therapeutic strategies. Rituximab (RTX) in combination with FAB 96 chemotherapy is a safe, well-tolerated treatment that is associated with > 90% EFS in children with newly diagnosed and advanced mature B-Cell NHL (Cairo M.S. et al. ASCO, 2010). Resistance to RTX, however, may predispose patients with CD20 + NHL to an increase risk of relapse and or disease progression (Barth/Cairo et al. BJH, 2012; Tsai et al. Cl. Can. Res, 2012). Obinutuzumab (GA101), a novel type II glycoengineered CD20 antibody of the IgG1 isotype, mediates enhanced cell death vs RTX and has a glycoengineered Fc region that induces significantly enhanced ADCC (Mo\u0308ssner et al. Bld, 2010; Niederfellner G. et al. Bld, 2011; Bologna L et al. JI, 2012). Objective: To evaluate the in-vitro efficacy of GA101 compared to RTX against RTX sensitive and resistant CD20 + B-NHL and B-LL cell lines. Methods: Raji (CD20 + ,ATCC, Manhass, VA), U698-M (CD20+, DSMZ, Germany), Loucy cells (CD20 \u2212 ) (T-ALL) (ATCC, Manhass, VA) and Raji-2R and Raji-4RH (generously supplied by M. Barth, Roswell Park Cancer Institute) were cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS and incubated with GA101 and/or RTX at 100 \u03bcg/ml for 24 hrs (n=6), 48 and 72 hrs (n=5). Cell death was evaluated by staining with AnnexinV/7AAD and flow-cytometry. Loucy cells (CD20 \u2212 ) were used as the negative control. The caspase 3/7 activity was measured by FAM caspase 3/7 assay kit by FLICA\u2122 methodology. RSCL, RRCL, U698-M and Loucy were incubated with GA101 and RTX treatment for 24, 48 and 72 hrs, and caspase3/7 activity was detected by FACS using 488 nm excitation and emission filter (n=3). ADCC were performed with K562-IL-15\u201341BBL expanded NK cells (Ayello/Cairo et al. ASH, 2010) as well as IL-2 expanded NK cells, at 20:1 effector: target ratio (E: T, n=3) using europium release assay (Perkin-Elmer). Results: GA101 induced significantly more cell death compared to RTX in B-NHL and BLL cell lines. (Table-1)  24 hrs . 48 hrs . Groups . RTX Obinutuzumab . P-value . RTX Obinutuzumab . P-value .

Conclusion: Obinutuzumab compared to RTX significantly enhanced cell death, caspase3/7 activity and NK mediated ADCC in sensitive and RTX resistant B-NHL and B-LL. Obinutuzumab represents a promising candidate for treating RTX sensitive and resistant CD20 + B-Cell Lymphomas and lymphoblastic leukemia. Further studies will investigate the combination of activated NK cells or chemotherapy that may enhance or synergize with the efficacy of GA101 (Obinutuzumab) both in -vitro and in-vivo in xenografted NOD/SCID mice.
