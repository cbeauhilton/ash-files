    "abstract_text": "Autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) was effective for severe SLE and may have curative potential in some cases, but recurrence of the disease was still a major problem. Allogeneic SCT for autoimmune disease has been shown to induce long-term remission through graft-versus-autoimmunity effect. Non-myeloablative SCT can induce full-donor Chimerism with much less toxicity. We report a case of 43 year old Chinese female with severe SLE refractory to high dose cyclophosphamide and had lupus nephritis. The patient also had avascular necrosis and was bed-bound. Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation were done from an HLA-matched sibling after non-ablative conditioning using ATG, Fludarabine and busulfan. The patient had good performace status nad had no recurrence at the last follow-up 16 months post-transplantation.",
