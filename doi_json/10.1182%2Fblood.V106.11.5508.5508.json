    "abstract_text": "G-CSF alone or in conjunction with chemotherapy is the most commonly used regimen to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells into peripheral blood (PB) for stem cell harvest. However, in about 10\u201330 % of patients when mobilized with this regimen, their hematopoietic progenitor cells are not effectively mobilized. We have adopted an approach of using higher doses of G-CSF from 16 to 36 ug/kg patient body weight to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells in patients that are poorly mobilized. Poor mobilization (PM) is defined as peak pre-apheresis PBCD34 count of < 20 cells/uL, and good mobilization (GM) is defined as peak pre-apheresis PBCD34 count of \u226520 cells/uL in the expected mobilization time frame. In this study, we retrospectively assess our experience using this mobilization approach regarding its efficacy and safety. The success of stem cell transplantation was evaluated based on neutrophil engraftment defined as an ANC (absolute neutrophil count) >500/uL, and platelet engraftment as a platelet count >20,000/uL without platelet transfusions for 2 consecutive days, respectively, as well as day 15 lymphocyte count. Safety of stem cell mobilization, apheresis collection, and stem cell infusion were also evaluated. The results are shown in the tables below.
