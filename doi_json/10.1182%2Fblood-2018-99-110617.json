    "abstract_text": "Background: MCL is a subtype of NHL that remains largely incurable with conventional therapies; BR is standard first-line therapy. Acalabrutinib is a potent, highly selective, covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor with minimal off-target activity. Acalabrutinib was approved by the FDA in October 2017 for patients with R/R MCL and \u22651 prior therapy. This ongoing, multicenter, open-label Phase 1b study assessed the safety and efficacy of acalabrutinib + BR in patients with TN or R/R MCL. Methods: Patients aged \u226518 y with ECOG PS \u22642 and adequate organ function were eligible; R/R patients had received \u22651 prior therapy. Patients received oral acalabrutinib 100 mg twice daily, plus B 90 mg/m 2 intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 2 and R 375 mg/m 2 IV on day 1 in each 28-day cycle. Acalabrutinib was given until disease progression (PD) or intolerance; BR was repeated every 28 days for up to 6 cycles. Patients with TN MCL who achieved partial or complete response (CR) received rituximab maintenance therapy (375 mg/m 2 every other cycle for up to 12 doses starting on cycle 8). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was evaluated in the first 6 patients per cohort (TN or R/R) after completing 1 cycle. If <2 patients had DLTs, cohorts were expanded. The primary endpoint was safety of acalabrutinib + BR. Secondary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR) and progression-free survival (PFS). Pharmacokinetic evaluation was exploratory. Results: A total of 38 patients enrolled (TN, n=18; R/R, n=20); 63% were men; 55% were \u226565 y. At baseline, 100% of TN and 95% of R/R patients had ECOG PS \u22641; 89% and 95% had Ann Arbor stage IV disease, 44% and 60% had intermediate-risk and 11% and 15% had high-risk simplified MCL International Prognostic Index scores, respectively. The median number of prior therapies in the R/R cohort was 2 (range 1-4) and 45% were refractory (stable disease or PD) to most recent prior treatment. As of 4 May 2018, median time on study was 17.6 mo (range 0.6-23.1) for TN and 14.2 mo (range 1.2-23.6) for R/R patients; 78% of TN and 50% of R/R patients completed 6 cycles of BR with acalabrutinib. Across both cohorts, no DLTs were observed. Adverse events (AEs) of any grade in \u226530% of patients in any cohort are in Table 1 . In the TN cohort, Grade \u22653 AEs in \u226510% of patients were neutropenia (33%) and pneumonia (11%). Serious AEs (SAEs) occuring in \u22652 patients included pneumonia (Grade 3, n=2 [11%]) and pyrexia (Grade 1, n=2 [11%]). One patient had pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage (Grade 4, investigator assessed as related to acalabrutinib) leading to discontinuation of study treatment (acalabrutinib + BR). There were 3 deaths: 1 patient had Grade 5 pneumonitis (investigator assessed as related to acalabrutinib; 24 days after last dose), 1 died of unascertained cause, and 1 died of unknown cause. In the R/R cohort, Grade \u22653 AEs (in \u226510%) were neutropenia (50%); diarrhea, leukopenia, decreased neutrophil count, pneumonia and thrombocytopenia (10% each). Pneumonia was the only SAE to occur in \u22652 patients (n=3; 1 Grade 1, 2 Grade 3). Three patients had major hemorrhage; all were Grade 3 AEs and investigator assessed as unrelated to study treatment (subdural hematoma [after a traumatic fall], large intestinal ulcer hemorrhage [on study day 2], gastrointestinal hemorrhage [duodenal tumor found on endoscopy]). One patient had Grade 3 angina pectoris (unrelated) leading to discontinuation of study treatment (acalabrutinib + BR). There were 4 deaths: 1 patient had Grade 5 AE cerebrospinal meningitis (investigator assessed as unrelated to acalabrutinib; 123 days after last dose), 1 died of unascertained cause, and 2 had PD. No patients had cytomegalovirus infection, pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or atrial fibrillation during the study. In the TN cohort, the ORR was 94%, with a CR rate of 72% ( Table 2 ); median DOR and median PFS were not reached (NR). In the R/R cohort, ORR was 80% and CR rate was 65%; median DOR was 15.0 mo (95% CI: 12.2, NR) and median PFS was 16.6 mo (95% CI: 14.2, NR). There were no clinically meaningful differences in steady-state acalabrutinib exposure when administered with or without BR (n=12 [TN, n=6; R/R, n=6]). Conclusion: Combination therapy with acalabrutinib + BR showed an acceptable safety profile, with no meaningful changes in acalabrutinib exposure. The high CR rate with acalabrutinib + BR in both TN and R/R MCL further supports a phase 3 randomized study of acalabrutinib + BR versus BR in TN MCL (NCT02972840).
