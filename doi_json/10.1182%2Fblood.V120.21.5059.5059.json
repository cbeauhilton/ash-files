    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5059 JAK2 inhibitors are known to improve symptoms, to control myeloproliferation and to reduce splenomegaly in patients diagnosed with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs)Ph(-). However their ability to decrease the allele burden and achieve molecular responses is controversial. Objective: To evaluate hematologic, clinical and molecular responses according to the criteria of the European LeukemiaNet and European Myelofibrosis Network in 13 patients treated with JAK2 inhibitors. Material and Methods: We performed a prospective study in the Haematology Service of the Hospital La Paz between 1987 and 2012 in 13 patients diagnosed with NMP Ph (-) and treated with of JAK2 inhibitors: 5 secondary mylofibrosis (SFM)to homozygous polycythemia vera JAK (+), 4 SFM to essential thrombocythemias JAK (-), 2 primary myelofibrosis (one JAK (-) and one heterozygous JAK (+)) and 2 homozygous PV JAK (+) resistant to hydrea. The RT-PCR was performed at 6 or 12 months after the first determination of the allelic burden. Median follow-up was 3 months (1 \u2013 15). A) Hematologic Response (HR): 3/5 SFM to PV(1)/TE JAK(-)(2) reached HR at 3 months of initiation of JAK2 inhibitor to 20mg/day. Molecular and clinical response were not evaluated. B) Clinical Response: Three patients had a reduction in the spleen size. Only one patient in the SFM group had a reduction in the spleen size (18 cm before the drug was commenced to 13. 7 cm) and the allele burden decrease from 55% to 23% after 5 months of therapy with JAK2 inhibitor at 25mg/12h (increase of 5mg/12h after 15 days of initiation of medication). 2/3 MFS to TE JAK(-) had a reduction from 15, 3 cm before the drug was commenced to 9 cm after 3 months of therapy with JAK2 inhibitor at 20 mg/12h. 3/3 MFP JAK(-) had a 6cm reduction in spleen size. Twenty cm splenomegaly was documented before starting JAK2 inhibitor to 15 mg/day. C) Molecular Response: 2/5 SFM to PV decreased the previous allele burden value. One patient decreased by 25% the previous allele burden value (99. 28%) at 6 months of JAK2 inhibitor. Second patient decreased by 13% the previous allele burden value (55%) at 6 months of starting JAK2 inhibitor to 25 mg/day. In 1/2 PV, the previous allele burden value (93. 17%) decreased by 11. 4% at 6 months of starting JAK2 inhibitor at 100mg/24h. D) Lack of response and disease progression: One patient with SMF secondary to JAK 2 (-) ET had dose reductions from 20 mg twice a day secondary to grade IV thrombocytopenia and renal toxicity. Patient finally developed acute leukemia. Conclusions: Our study confirms that JAK2 inhibitors reduce splenomegaly in MPNs JAK(-)and JAK(+). Prospective studies with an adequate sample size are necessary to demonstrate whether splenomegaly and symptom reductions achieved with inhibition of JAK2 could be associated to decrease the allele burden and achieve molecular responses in MPNs JAK(+).
