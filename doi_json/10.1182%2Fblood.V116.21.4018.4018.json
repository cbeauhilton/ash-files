    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4018 Several T cell abnormalities have been described in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and such abnormalities may become important for identification of patients who will benefit from T cell targeting immunosuppressive treatment. Chemokine receptor repertoires are important in the regulation of both T cell migration and function and may therefore be important in the development of MDS. Materials and Methods: The chemokine receptor expression by circulating T cells were investigated by multicolor flow cytometry for patients with newly diagnosed low risk MDS (N=16) and for healthy controls (N=18). CD3 + CD8 + and CD3 + CD8 - cells were examined for expression of CCR2-7, CXCR3-4 and CX3CR1 (only 7 unselected patients examined for CX3CR1 expression). CCR6 and CXCR4 expression was also investigated for specific T cell subsets defined by CD62L and CD45RA expression (nai\u0308ve, central memory, effector memory and terminal effector). CX3CR1 expression was stratified for CD8 + and CD8 - subpopulations according to high, low and negative expression of CCR5. Results: Chemokine receptor profiles showed several differences between low risk MDS patients and controls. Total CD8 + T cells from MDS patients showed increased expression of CCR3 (p=0.005) and decreased expression of CCR7 and CCR4 (p=0.023 and p=0.036 respectively), whereas the CD8 - T cells from MDS patients showed increased expression of CX3CR1 (p=0.043). In contrast, CCR6 expression was increased only by CD8 + central memory T cells (p=0.044). Finally, CD8 + CCR5 - and CD8 - CCR5 high cells from MDS patients showed increased expression of CX3CR1 compared with the controls (p=0.011 and p=0.049). Discussion: CCR7 is mainly expressed by central memory and nai\u0308ve T cells whereas CX3CR1 is especially expressed by cytotoxic effector lymphocytes independent of the lymphocyte subclass (i.e. CD4, CD8, delta/gamma and NK cells). The observed changes are in line with a shift from nai\u0308ve/central memory to effector/effector memory dominance, especially in the CD8 + population. A similar shift has been described previously using CD45RA and CD62L (Zou et al , Leukemia 2009). Our median values are in line with such a shift. CCR6 expression is associated with IL17 production both for CD8 + and CD4 + cells, and increased levels of circulating CD4 + IL17 producing cells in low risk MDS have been described. Conclusions: The chemokine receptor profiles of circulating T cells differ between low risk MDS patients and healthy controls, especially for the CD8 + T cell subset. These differences may be important for T cell trafficking and disease development, and they may reflect a shift from nai\u0308ve to effector/effector memory cell dominance in low risk MDS.
