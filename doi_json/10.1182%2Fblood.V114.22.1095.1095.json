    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1095 Poster Board I-117 Introduction Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital abnormalities, and an increased risk for cancer and leukemia. Components of the FA-BRCA pathway are thought to function in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Central to this pathway is the monoubiquitylation and chromatin localization of two FA proteins, FANCD2 and FANCI. Recent reports implicate mismatch repair factors in the repair of ICLs and have shown that FANCJ interacts with the MutL\u03b1a complex. Here we show that FANCD2 binds several mismatch repair proteins in vivo and that MSH2 is required for the monoubiquitylation and chromatin localization of both FANCD2 and FANCI. Methods Cell lines used: HeLa, human lung carcinoma cell line H1299, FA-A cell line GM6914 and corrected cell line GM6914 + Flag-FANCA, FA-D2 cell line PD20 and corrected cell lines PD20+Flag-FANCD2 and PD20+FANCD2 K561R, human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line HEC59 (MSH2-deficient) and corrected cell line HEC59+Ch2, and human colon carcinoma cell line HCT116 (MLH1-deficient) and corrected cell line HCT116 + Ch3 . Cells were treated with the crosslinking agent mitomycin C (MMC). Immunoprecipitation was used to demonstrate the interaction between FANCD2 and MSH2, MLH1, and MSH3. Survival assays were performed by crystal violet staining and extraction. Chromatin loading of FANCD2 and FANCI was determined by cellular fractionation and western blot. Results Through chromatographic purification of FANCD2-containing protein complexes, we identified MSH2 and MLH1 as FANCD2-interacting proteins. Immunoprecipitation using HeLa cell extracts confirmed the interaction between FANCD2, MSH2, MSH3, and MLH1 in vivo. These interactions are all induced upon damage with a DNA crosslinking agent and MSH2 specifically interacts only with the monoubiquitylated form of FANCD2. Additionally, the FANCD2-MSH2 interaction requires ATR, but not ATM, BRCA1, MSH3, or ERCC1/XPF. Human cells lacking MSH2 display increased sensitivity to mitomycin C as compared to their corrected counterparts. FANCD2 and FANCI monoubiquitylation is also greatly diminished in these cells, while cells lacking MLH1 show no effect. Cellular fractionation of MSH2-deficient cells shows that FANCD2 and FANCI are not efficiently loaded onto chromatin after treatment with DNA-damaging agents, while MLH1-deficient cells again show no effect. Interestingly, while knockdown of either MSH2 or FANCD2 in H1299 cells results in increased sensitivity to MMC, double knockdown of both proteins corrects this sensitivity on par with controls. oConclusions These data suggest that mismatch repair proteins play a key role in the activation of the FA-BRCA pathway, likely through recognition of the DNA lesion. Understanding this role could lead to the development of new therapies for the treatment of patients both with FA and cancer. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
