    "abstract_text": "Background: Although thalidomide induced neuropathy has been described for decades, many features such as incidence, risk factors, severity and character of the neuropathy are not well defined. We retrospectively reviewed the incidence and clinical course of peripheral neuropathy in patients treated with thalidomide or thalidomide/dexamethasone (Thal/Dex) on a Phase II Mayo Clinic trial. Methods: Patients who participated in a Mayo Clinic Phase II trial of thalidomide in myeloma were studied. In this trial, patients with SMM and RMM received thalidomide 200 mg per day escalated as tolerated to a maximum of 800 mg/day. Patients with NMM received thalidomide 200 mg/day plus dexamethasone 40 mg/day orally on days 1\u20134, 9\u201312, 17\u201320 (odd cycles) and 40 mg/day days 1\u20134 (even cycles) repeated monthly. The incidence and clinical course of neuropathy was assessed by chart review. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board. Results: All 113 patients (70 male, 43 female) treated on trial were studied; 31 patients with smoldering/indolent myeloma (SMM), 32 patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma (RMM) and 50 patients with newly diagnosed myeloma (NMM). Patients were accrued to the parent protocol from April 1999 through March 2002. The median age was 62 years (range, 36\u201378). The median duration of thalidomide therapy on protocol was 15 months in SMM, 6 months in RMM and 4 months in NMM. Overall, 63 patients (56 %) developed symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. The incidence of neuropathy was 77%, 50%, and 46% in patients with SMM, RMM, and NMM, respectively. Neuropathy worsened during the treatment phase with/without dose reduction or after cessation in 15%, remained stable in 52%, and improved in 27%. Overall grade of neuropathy was grade 1 in most pts; 11% of all patients had grade 2 neuropathy and 2% had grade 3 neuropathy. Predominant symptoms of neuropathy were tingling and numbness involving both upper limb and lower limbs. Small subsets of patients complained of hearing loss 6 patients), and erectile dysfunction (4 patients). Electromyographic studies and nerve conduction studies were performed in 11 patients; the most common finding was a length dependent axonal neuropathy. Conclusion: Peripheral neuropathy is an important and common adverse event with thalidomide therapy that often limits the dose and duration of treatment. Its incidence and severity are likely related to dose and duration of therapy.",
