The outcomes of patients younger than 65 years have been shown to be improved with the availability of novel therapies. However, older adults, who comprise the majority of patients with myeloma, have not experienced the same improvement in outcomes as noted in epidemiologic studies (Brenner et al. Hematologica 2009. 94 (2): 270 and Schaapveld et al, Eur J Cancer . 2009. 46 (1):160.). We postulated that lack of access to novel agents, difference in disease biology, or competing causes of mortality might explain this finding. Method: We conducted a retrospective review of electronic medical records for patients 75 years of age or older at the time of diagnosis with symptomatic myeloma after 2004 (to allow for the availability of novel agents). Demographic information including comorbid conditions, disease characteristics (including risk features and cytogenetics), treatment information as well as survival data was collected. Risk stratification (standard or high risk) was based on the Mayo criteria (Steward et al. Leukemia 2007; 21: 529). Result: 72 patients (median age 78 years, range 75\u201389, 58% were older than 80 years) with symptomatic myeloma were the subjects of this study. Seventy-two percent were males and 28%, 15%, 60% and 29% had a history of cardiac dysfunction (defined as CAD or CHF), diabetes, hypertension and another malignancy (excluding non melanoma skin cancer) respectively. While 31 patients had missing information to determine the International Staging System; 29%, 32% and 39% had ISS stages 1, 2, and 3, respectively (similar to what is expected in younger cohorts). Moreover, using the Mayo risk model, 31% of patients had high risk disease. The median number of systemic therapies received was 2 (range 0\u20136). First line therapy did not include a novel agent in 29% of patients (who received alkylating agents 12%, anthracyclines 4%, corticosteroids alone 13%) and at the time of relapse, all but 4 patients had received a novel agent. First line therapy consisted of lenalidomide based regimens (30%), bortezomib based regimens (12%), thalidomide based regimens (28%) and a combination of novel agents (1%). The median overall survival for the entire cohort was 46 months (95% CI: 36.4\u201356.2 months). Conclusion: Older adults (greater than 75 years of age) with multiple myeloma continue to experience a shortened survival despite the use of novel agents and without a discernable higher incidence of high risk disease suggesting competing causes of mortality and tolerance to therapy may significantly limit the benefit of novel therapies in this age group. To address these limitations, we have initiated a clinical trial evaluating a sequential response adapted lenalidomide based therapy for older adults with newly diagnosed myeloma in order to minimize treatment related toxicities.
