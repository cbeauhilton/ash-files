    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4947 Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of survivin and the apoptosis induced by DNR and BrTet in the leukemic cells K562/A02. Methods: In a typical experiment, the K562/AO2 cells were treated with daunorubicin (DNR), 5-bromotetrandrine (BrTet), or DNR and BrTet for 48 hours, and the cells treated without any drugs were used as control group. Cell proliferation was analyzed by MTT assay. Cells apoptosis and the concentration of DNR within the cells were measured by Flow cytometry (FCM). The expressions of mRNA and protein of survivin were determined by semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. Results: The results of MTT assay indicated that DNR and BrTet were both able to inhibit the proliferation of K562/AO2 cells in dose-dependent manner. The fresh evidence from flow cytometry showed that a higher apoptosis rate could be induced and a higer concentration of DNR could be detected in K562/AO2 cells by DNR and BrTet as compared with those by DNR or BrTet in the same concentrations(P0.05). Western bolt demonstrated that the expression of survivin protein was much lower in the DNR and BrTet group(P<0.05). Conclusion: BrTet could increase the concentration of DNR and reverse the multidrug resistance(MDR) in the K562/AO2 cells. Survivin may play an important role in apoptosis induced by DNR. Survivin could be a target for the treatment of MDR in haematopoietic malignancies. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
