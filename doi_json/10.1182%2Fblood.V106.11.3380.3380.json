    "abstract_text": "BAFF is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family and is critical for the maintenance and homeostasis of normal B-cell development. Importantly, BAFF promotes the generation of rapidly dividing immunoglobulin secreting plasmablasts from activated memory B cells by enhancing their survival. Given that MM is a cancer of plasma cells and that the signaling cascades implicated in receptor ligand interactions of BAFF are crucial in MM cell biology, we hypothesized that this cytokine may play a critical role in MM cell development, survival, and proliferation. We performed gene expression profiling (GEP) on CD 138+ plasma cells isolated from 90 MM patients (45 newly diagnosed and 45 relapsed) and 11 healthy controls using the Affymetrix U133A arrays. Our data demonstrates increased expression of transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) and B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), 2 receptors used by BAFF to exert its effects. Our data also shows an increased expression of a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), another member of the TNF family with homology to BAFF. Expression levels of BAFF and BAFF-R could not be determined because of lack of these probe sets on the Affymetrix U133A arrays. GEP analysis shows increased BCMA expression (p<0.0001, student T test) on newly diagnosed and relapsed MM versus normal plasma cells. Flow cytometry on MM cell lines demonstrated a differential expression of the three receptors of BAFF, with BCMA present on most cell lines but BAFF-R expressed at low levels only on LR5 cells and DOX40 MM cells. In contrast, flow cytometry performed on MM patient cells demonstrated the presence of all 3 receptors on CD 138+ cells. ELISA assays performed on 30 MM sera demonstrated a mean BAFF level of 618 pg/ml (range: 128\u20132126pg/ml) versus 235pg/ml (range: 158\u2013326pg/ml) in 7 normal donor sera. Fifty six% (17/30) of MM patients had BAFF levels in excess of the highest value noted in normals. To understand the role BAFF might play in the biology of MM, we studied the effects of recombinant BAFF (rh-BAFF) on MM cells directly and in the context of its bone marrow microenvironment. (abstract # 554746) rh-BAFF conferred a survival advantage to MM cells and protected them against dexamethasone-induced cytotoxicity. Importantly, anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl2 and Mcl-1 were upregulated, as were growth and survival signals belonging to the JAK/STAT and MAPKinase pathways. Conversely, neutralizing antibody to BAFF blocked, at least in part, blocked the upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins with associated growth and survival, confirming that these effects were due to BAFF. Importantly, all of these signals were downregulated even in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). These data therefore show a role for BAFF mediating MM cell survival and provide the framework for inhibiting BAFF, either alone or in combination with dexamethasone, to improve patient outcome in MM.",
