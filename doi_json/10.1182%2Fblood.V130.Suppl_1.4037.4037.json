    "abstract_text": "Introduction: First generation PI3K\u03b4 inhibitors such as idelalisib and duvelisib are active in patients (pts) with lymphoid malignancies but are often associated with significant immune-mediated adverse events, including transaminitis, diarrhea/colitis, and pneumonitis, as well as an increased risk of serious infections. These toxicities can be severe, and frequently lead to treatment discontinuation. Umbralisib (TGR-1202) is a next generation, once-daily, oral PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor, that is active in pts with relapsed/refractory (R/R) lymphoid malignancies, with a 94% ORR in previously treated CLL (Burris et al, 2015). Umbralisib has a markedly different chemical structure and pharmacologic profile compared to idelalisib and duvelisib, and kinome-profiling further differentiates umbralisib from these agents. All three compounds are selective for the PI3K\u03b4 isoform, however the PI3K\u03b3 isoform, which promotes pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased recruitment and cytotoxicity of T cells, is not inhibited by umbralisib (Kaneda et al, Nature 2016). Umbralisib also has an additional effect on casein kinase-1 epsilon (CK-1\u03b5), a protein which may have an inhibitory effect on regulatory T-cell function (Deng et al, 2016). Collectively, these pharmacologic features provide a potential rationale for the differentiated toxicity profile of umbralisib compared to other PI3K\u03b4 inhibitors. Here, we present an integrated safety analysis for pts dosed with umbralisib either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. Methods : Safety data were pooled from 5 completed or ongoing Phase 1 or 2 studies containing umbralisib. All studies shared similar key eligibility criteria: pts had R/R lymphoid malignancies with an ECOG PS \u2264 2 without limit to number of prior therapies. Umbralisib was dosed daily until progression or unacceptable toxicity, while dosing of combination agents varied. Adverse event grading was done by CTCAE v4.03 criteria. Results : A total of 336 patients were included in the analysis. Patients received the following regimens: umbralisib as monotherapy (135 pts) or umbralisib in combination with: the glycoengineered anti-CD20 mAb ublituximab (\"U2\", 98 pts), ibrutinib (32 pts), ublituximab + ibrutinib (38 pts), or ublituximab + bendamustine (33 pts). Among the 336 patients, 32% had CLL/SLL, 35% DLBCL, 22% indolent NHL, and 12% other lymphoma. Median and mean duration of exposure to umbralisib was 5 and 9 months respectively, with the longest patient on daily umbralisib for 4+ years, and a cumulative duration of drug exposure across all 336 patients of over 240 years. Common all-grade adverse events regardless of causality are described in Table 1, and Grade 3/4 adverse events are described in Table 2. The most common all-grade non-hematologic toxicities were: diarrhea (44%), nausea (39%), and fatigue (35%). All-grade hematologic toxicities included neutropenia (22%), anemia (20%), and thrombocytopenia (18%). Grade 3/4 adverse events were infrequent, with the most common non-hematologic events including diarrhea (4%) and dyspnea (3%), and hematologic toxicities of neutropenia (17%), anemia (6%), and thrombocytopenia (5%). Key adverse events prevalent amongst prior generation PI3K\u03b4 inhibitors were also infrequent: transaminitis (9% All; G3/4 1% of patients were pneumonia (5%), febrile neutropenia (3%), sepsis (2%), and pyrexia (2%). Discontinuations due to adverse events were rare at under 10% for all studies. Conclusions : In this integrated safety analysis of 336 patients, many of whom were on treatment for over a year, umbralisib exhibits a differentiated safety profile compared to prior generation PI3k\u03b4 inhibitors. Improved tolerability with very few discontinuations of umbralisib due to AEs has allowed patients to remain on continuous dosing to achieve and sustain promisingly high rates of response. The mechanism for decreased immune-mediated toxicity is still being elucidated through ongoing pre-clinical and correlative studies examining umbralisib's selectivity for PI3K\u03b4 over PI3K\u03b3, complimentary CK1\u03b5 inhibition, and enhancement of regulatory T-cell function.
