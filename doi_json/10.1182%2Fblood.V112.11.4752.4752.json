Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) give rise to the cellular components of the bone marrow microenvironment and support expansion and differentiation of hematopoeitic stem cells in the respective niche. Low oxygen tension is thought to be an integral component of the endosteal niche microenvironment. When used for therapeutic purposes, MSCs cultured in standard conditions must adapt from 21% oxygen to less than 1% oxygen in the ischemic tissue. Understanding the mechanisms by which the production of cytokines and growth factors by MSCs is regulated may represent an important way to optimize their beneficial paracrine and autocrine effects. Human primary MSCs were incubated under normoxic (20% O 2 ) and hypoxic (0.5% O 2 ) conditions over five days and the pattern of released cytokines in the cell culture supernatants was compared using a human cytokine array (R & D Systems). Amongst others, we found upregulated IL-8 levels under hypoxic conditions leading us to further investigation of IL-8 expression in MSCs and its role for in-vitro migration. As expected, IL-8 mRNA levels were significantly higher in hypoxic MSCs. The result of the cytokine array was confirmed by examination of secreted IL-8 in the cell culture supernatant by ELISA (PeproTech). The migration capacity was investigated in a 24-well transwell chamber assay with 8 \u03bcm pore size. Using recombinant IL-8 as a chemoattractant in the lower chamber, we detected an almost twofold enhanced MSC migration rate after 24 hours under hypoxic conditions. As a different approach to investigate the migratory capacity, we used an in-vitro scratch assay. A wound was applied to a MSC monolayer in absence or presence of IL-8 which clearly enhanced the migration of MSCs into the wound area after 24 hours. In summary, IL-8 secretion by human primary MSCs is clearly increased under hypoxic conditions. IL-8 in turn seems to be a chemotactic factor for MSCs and enhances their migratory capacity in an autocrine manner.",
