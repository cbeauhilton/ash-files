    "abstract_text": "Due to the large size of FVIII, a B-domain deleted FVIII (BDD-FVIII) cDNA is usually used for developing gene therapy protocols for treating hemophilia A. Inefficient transcription of wild- type FVIII cDNA can be overcome by deletion of the heavily glycosylated B-domain encoding portion of the gene. BDD-FVIII is as clinically efficacious and not more immunogenic than full-length recombinant FVIII. More recently, it was demonstrated that a partial deletion of the B-domain leaving an N-terminal 226 amino acid stretch containing 6 putative asparagine-linked glycosylation sites intact (FVIII/N6) was able to increase in vitro and in vivo secretion of FVIII by 10\u201315 fold. We have inserted this B domain variant FVIII/N6 cDNA into our liver-specific gene expression vector. The resulting construct, FVIII/N6 plasmid was delivered into the hemophilia A mouse liver by the hydrodynamic method. In control mice treated with BDD-FVIII plasmid (n=5/group), FVIII expression dropped to undetectable levels at 2 weeks post injection and high-titer anti-FVIII antibodies were generated in all the plasmid-treated mice. However, in mice treated with FVIII/N6 plasmid (n=5/group), one out of five mice never developed inhibitory antibodies and still had some FVIII gene expression (~10%) at 8 weeks post gene transfer. Three FVIII/N6 plasmid-treated mice developed anti-FVIII antibodies with significantly reduced inhibitor titer and only one mouse developed high-titer inhibitory antibodies. The CD4+ T cells isolated from the spleen of mice injected with FVIII/N6 constructs proliferated less in response to FVIII stimulation than those from mice injected with BDD-FVIII. These results indicate that FVIII/N6 protein is less immunogenic than BDD-FVIII. Interestingly, both BDD-FVIII and FVIII/N6 constructs produced similar levels of FVIII gene expression (100\u2013300%) initially following nonviral gene transfer. However this could be due to saturation of the ER to Golgi transport apparatus for FVIII by the initial high-level gene expression. Gene expression levels produced by using reduced dosages of BDD-FVIII and FVIII/N6 plasmids are currently being evaluated and compared. These findings suggest that use of a FVIII/N6 construct decreases transgene-specific immune responses following nonviral gene transfer and facilitates long-term gene expression."
