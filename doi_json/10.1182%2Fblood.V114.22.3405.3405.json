    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3405 Poster Board III-293 Background: Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AutoHCT) as consolidation has been an alternative to standard intensive chemotherapy and/or allogeneic HCT for younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR). However concerns about toxicity and true benefits in long-term outcome have hampered its use. Methods: We present the follow-up of younger patients with de novo AML treated on ECOG study E1900, on an intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analysis. DFS and OS were measured from the time of registration to consolidation therapy. Results: 657 patients younger than 61 years were initially randomized to standard-dose cytarabine and either standard- or high-dose daunorubicin in a 7+3 approach. Of the 352 patients who entered consolidation phase, 307 patients, 68 with favorable-risk cytogenetics (FRC), 128 with intermediate-risk cytogenetics (IRC), 90 with indeterminate cytogenetics (IDT) and 21 with unfavorable-risk cytogenetics (URC), were allocated to AutoHCT. Patients in these cohorts were treated with high-dose cytarabine 3g/m 2 x 6 doses in 5 days, for two cycles. Peripheral blood cells were collected after the second cycle. Initially patients were randomized to receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) or not; however, no benefit was derived from GO therapy and the randomization was closed. 156 patients did not receive the planned AutoHCT due to disease progression, alternative therapy, failure to collect, insurance denial, toxicity and other reasons. 151 patients (33 FRC, 64 IRC, 47 IDT and 7 URC) were conditioned with IV busulfan 0.8 mg/kg daily x 16 doses (without dose adjustment) and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg x 2 days. Autologous cells were infused on day 0 and patients were supported with sargramostim until ANC recovery > 500/\u03bcL. Veno-occlusive disease occurred in three patients. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) of AutoHCT was 1.3% (2/151) at 30 days. Median follow-up was 31.8 months. In the ITT analysis, median disease-free survival (DFS) was 21.1 months and overall survival (OS) was 31.8 months. For patients treated PP, median DFS and OS were 29.8 months and 39.7 months, respectively. Median DFS by cytogenetics was, 20.5 months for IRC and 22.4 months for IDT; not reached for the FRC group (p=0.10) and median OS was 32.8 months for IRC and 34.4 months for IDT; not reached for the FRC group (p=0.06). For FRC patients treated with high dose daunorubicin induction and AutoHCT the DFS and OS was \u2265 80% at 4 years based on K-M estimates. Patients who were FLT3 -positive (n=27) demonstrated a trend towards worse DFS (16.2 vs. 30.3 months) and OS (20.0 vs.39.7 months) than those who were FLT3 -negative (n=113) (p=0.12 and 0.10, respectively). Conclusions: Auto HCT is a safe consolidation approach with a low TRM in younger patients with de novo AML in first remission. Results are excellent in respect to DFS and OS particularly for the FRC patients on the high-dose daunorubicin arm. Due to small numbers, we could not demonstrate a negative outcome in FLT3 -positive patients receiving AutoHCT. Further study, however, with a larger number of patients is warranted.
