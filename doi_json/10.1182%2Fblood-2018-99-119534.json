    "abstract_text": "Background Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been shown to rescue trilineage cytopenias and to prevent occurrence of myeloid malignancies in patients with Fanconi Anemia (FA). HLA-identical family donor HSCT is a recommended treatment strategy with an \u226580% cure rate, and outcomes of HSCT from unrelated donors have progressively improved over time. However, HLA-partially matched (haplo) HSCTs have been historically associated with inferior results. Innovative approaches of graft manipulation, such as selective depletion of \u03b1\u03b2-T and B cells, have recently been reported to improve the outcomes of haplo-HSCT in children with non-malignant disorders, however obstacles remain, such as delayed recovery of adaptive immunity with a risk of life-threatening infections. Novel strategies aimed at accelerating immune reconstitution are warranted to optimize the outcomes of patients transplanted from a HLA-haploidentical family donor. BPX-501 is an allogeneic product consisting of T cells modified to express the inducible caspase-9 (iC9) safety switch and truncated CD19 to allow monitoring and expansion of BPX-501 following transplant. The polyclonal nature of the BPX-501 provides broad virus and tumor-specific immunity, while the safety switch provides the unique ability to promptly and durably resolve graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) symptoms following the administration of rimiducid which induces dimerization and activation of iC9, inducing apoptosis of BPX-501. Aims To evaluate the safety and efficacy (acceleration of immune recovery and prevention of transplant-related mortality while maintaining low rates of acute and chronic GvHD) of BPX-501 administered after a \u03b1\u03b2 T and B-cell depleted haplo-HSCT in pediatric patients with FA. Methods This is a multicenter US (NCT03301168) and EU (NCT02065869), prospective trial utilizing \u03b1\u03b2-T- and B-cell-depleted haplo-HSCT followed by infusion of donor lymphocytes genetically modified to express iC9 (BPX-501 T cells). BPX-501 cells were planned to be infused on day14\u00b14 after the allograft per protocol. No post-transplant pharmacological GvHD prophylaxis was employed. Patients who develop GvHD resistant to conventional steroid therapy were eligible to receive \u22651 dose of dimerizing rimiducid activating iC9. The efficacy-evaluable population (EEP) was defined as any patient with FA who received HSCT, BPX-501 infusion and had at least one follow-up assessment. Results At the time of clinical cut-off (June 30 th , 2018), 14 patients met the EEP definition. Nine and 5 patients were transplanted in the EU and US, respectively. The median follow-up was 23.5 mos (0.75 - 42 mos). Key baseline and transplant characteristics are detailed in Table 1. The median time for neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 14 (11-15) and 10 (8 - 11) days, respectively. One patient experienced primary graft failure (7.7% [95% CI: 0-22.2%]). Only one patient developed Grade I aGvHD (7.7% [95% CI: 0-22.2%]). Two patients developed cGvHD (19.2% [95% CI: 4-43.2%]), both cases being moderate. Rimiducid was not administered to any patient. One patient died after transplantation due to brain hemorrhage 25 days post HSCT. The event was unrelated to BPX-501 (TRM 7.1% [95% CI: 0-20.6%]). No patients died of infectious complications. The probability of both overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was 92.9% (95% CI: 79.4-100%). The median time from last red blood cell (RBC) transfusion was 23.6 mos (0.2 - 41.9 mos). CD3 + and CD3 + CD4 + T cells above 500 cells/ml were achieved by 180 and 360 days, respectively. IgA and IgM levels achieved normal values by 30 and 180 days, respectively. The percentage of circulating and median absolute BPX-501 cells at Day 100 were 3.35% \u00b1 2.94% (0 - 8.4%) and 29.09 \u00b1 39.56 cells/ml (0 - 135 cells/ml), respectively. Conclusion These data indicate that the adoptive transfer of BPX-501 following \u03b1\u03b2-T and B-cell depleted haplo-HSCT represents a novel and highly effective transplantation strategy for pediatric patients with FA. Further, despite the addition of BPX-501, low rates and severity of both acute and chronic GvHD was observed, a finding that could translate into significant long-term benefit, in terms of reduction of squamous cell carcinoma a well-known complication occurring in FA patients after HSCT.
