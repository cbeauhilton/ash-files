    "abstract_text": "DNA methylation and demethylation at cytosine residues are epigenetic modifications that regulate gene expression associated with early cell development, somatic cell differentiation, cellular reprogramming and malignant transformation. While the process of DNA methylation and maintenance by DNA methyltransferases is well described, the nature of DNA demethylation remains poorly understood. The current model of DNA demethylation proposes modification of 5-methylcytosine followed by DNA repair-dependent cytosine substitution. Although there is debate on the extent of its involvement in DNA demethylation, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) has recently emerged as an enzyme that is capable of deaminating 5-methylcytosine to thymine, creating a T:G mismatch which can be repaired back to cytosine through DNA repair pathways. AID is expressed at low levels in many tissue types but is most highly expressed in germinal center B cells where it deaminates cytidine to uracil during somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination of the immunoglobulin genes. In addition to this critical role in immune diversification, aberrant targeting of AID contributes to oncogenic point mutations and chromosome translocations associated with B cell malignancies. Thus, to explore a role for AID in DNA demethylation in B cell lymphoma, we performed genome-wide methylation profiling in BL2 and AID-deficient ( AID -/- ) BL2 cell lines (Burkitt lymphoma that can be induced to express high levels of AID). Using Illumina\u2019s Infinium II DNA Methylation assay combined with the Infinium Human Methylation 450 Bead Chip, we analyzed over 450,000 methylation (CpG) sites at single nucleotide resolution in each line. BL2 AID -/- cells had a median average beta value (ratio of the methylated probe intensity to overall intensity) of 0.76 compared with 0.73 in AID-expressing BL2 cells ( P < 0.00001), indicating a significant reduction in global methylation in the presence of AID. Using a delta average beta value of \u2265 0.3 (high stringency cut-off whereby a difference of 0.3 or more defines a CpG site as hypomethylated), we identified 5883 CpG sites in 3347 genes that were hypomethylated in BL2 versus BL2 AID -/- cells. Using the Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip and Genome Studio software, we then integrated gene expression and methylation profiles from both lines to generate a list of genes that met the following criteria: 1) contained at least 4 methylation sites within the first 1500 bases downstream of the primary transcriptional start site (TSS 1500; AID is most active in this region during somatic hypermutation); 2) average beta value increased by >0.1 in the TSS 1500 region in BL2 compared with BL2 AID -/- cells; and 3) down-regulated by >50% in BL2 compared with BL2 AID -/- cells. This analysis identified 31 candidate genes targeted for AID-dependent demethylation with consequent changes in gene expression. Interestingly, 15 of these genes have been reported to be bound by AID in association with stalled RNA polymerase II in activated mouse B cells. After validating methylation status in a subset of genes ( APOBEC3B , BIN1 , DEM1 , GRN , GNPDA1 ) through bisulfite sequencing, we selected DEM1 for further analysis. DEM1 encodes an exonuclease involved in DNA repair and contains 16 CpG sites within its TSS1500, with only one site >50% methylated in BL2 cells compared with 8 of 16 in BL2 AID -/- cells. To assess a direct role for AID in DEM1 methylation status, a retroviral construct (AID\u0394L189-L198ER) driving tamoxifen-inducible expression of a C-terminal deletion mutant of AID (increases time spent in the nucleus) was introduced into BL2 AID -/- cells. BL2, BL2 AID -/- , and BL2 AID\u0394L189-L198ER cells were cultured continuously for 21 days in the presence of tamoxifen, 100 nM. Bisulfite sequencing of DEM1 TSS 1500 did not demonstrate any significant changes in methylation at day 7. However, at day 21, 13 of the 16 DEM1 TSS 1500 methylation sites in BL2 AID\u0394L189-L198ER cells were found to have an increase in the ratio of unmethylated to methylated clones ~10-25% above that of BL2 AID -/- cells. By qPCR, this correlated with a 1.75-fold increase in DEM1 gene expression to levels that were equivalent to that seen in BL2 cells ( P = 0.003). Although further investigations are needed, this data supports the notion that AID is able to regulate target gene expression in B cell malignancy through active DNA demethylation.
