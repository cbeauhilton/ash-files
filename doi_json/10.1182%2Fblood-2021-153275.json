    "abstract_text": "Signal transduction pathways regulate the proliferation and viability of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts. The regulation in the expression of cytokine receptors in AML is not well understood. In this study, we investigated how the CBF\u03b2-SMMHC fusion protein regulates expression of cytokine receptors in inv(16) AML, with focus on the co-receptor Neuropilin-1 (NRP1). Knock-down of CBF\u03b2-SMMHC expression, utilizing shRNA transduction, induced G1 phase of cell cycle arrest and reduced the viability of inv(16) ME-1 cells in culture. Expression profile analysis of CBF\u03b2-SMMHC knock-down cells revealed a significant repression of genes associated with transmembrane receptor protein kinase pathways, including NRP1 (-5 fold), FGFR1 (-4.2 fold) , FLT3 (-2 fold) and TGFBR2 (-1.2 fold). The expression of NRP1 was significantly upregulated in inv(16) AML cases when compared to other AML sub-types and to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Functionally, NRP1 knock-down reduced the viability of ME-1 cells with a similar dynamics as when using CBF\u03b2-SMMHC shRNAs. In addition, the proliferation of inv(16) AML cells was reduced 4.1-fold when treated with a function-blocking antibody for the FV/VIII extracellular NRP1 domain, while having no effect in non-inv(16) AML cells or when using blocking antibody for the CUB extracellular domain. Furthermore, deletion of Nrp1 by gene editing reduced the colony-forming unit capacity of primary mouse Cbfb +/MYH11 leukemic cells and extended the median leukemia latency in vivo . To identify the genes regulated by NRP1 in inv(16) AML, we analysed the transcription profile of NRP1 knock-down in ME-1 cells. Gene Set Enrichment and Pathway Analysis revealed a repression in STAT5 pathway, and in signalling receptor activity, including FLT3 (-1.8 fold) and TGFBR2 (-1.8 fold) expression, indicating that NRP1 mediates transcriptional regulation of FLT3 and TGFBR2 expression in inv(16) AML. Furthermore, the regulation of FLT3 and TGFB2 expression by CBF\u03b2-SMMHC and by NRP1 was validated by gene editing in inv(16) AML blasts. Accordingly, NRP1 knock-down in AML cells reduced SMAD2/3 phosphorylation. The repression of RUNX1/CBF\u03b2 function, using small molecule inhibitors, in inv(16) AML cells with CBF\u03b2-SMMHC knockdown restored NRP1 expression, suggesting that RUNX1 may repress NRP1 expression in AML cells. To evaluate if RUNX1 directly regulates NRP1 expression, we tested RUNX1 binding in the NRP1 locus of AML cells with CBF\u03b2-SMMHC knockdown. RUNX1 binding at one of six sites with RUNX1 occupancy identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing ( RE5 , regulatory element 5) was increased in the CBF\u03b2-SMMHC knock-down cells. The RE5 is located 178kb upstream of the NRP1 transcription start site and it is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates. The deletion of RE5 by gene editing (~50% editing efficiency) increased NRP1 expression 1.8-fold, suggesting that RUNX1 may repress NRP1 expression at by binding to the RE5 enhancer. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that CBF\u03b2-SMMHC regulates expression of cytokine receptors in inv(16) AML. Specifically, it directly regulates expression of the co-receptor NRP1, which is essential for AML survival, acting (at least in part) by regulating FLT3 and TGFB pathways.
