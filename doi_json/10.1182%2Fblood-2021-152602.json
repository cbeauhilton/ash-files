    "abstract_text": "Background A significant proportion of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) will either be refractory to initial chemotherapy or will suffer refractory relapse. The role of allogeneic transplantation (SCT) in active disease is contentious. There is a growing body of literature that sequential chemotherapy, pioneered by the German FLAMSA regimen, followed by RIC SCT is a safe and efficacious modality in these patients, and there have been numerous modifications of this regimen, especially as amsacrineis not widely available. Fludarabine, cytarabineand and etoposide (VP16) (FLAV) have been reported as an effective salvage regimen. Here we report on single center outcomes of a variation of the FLAMSA regimen, substituting amsacrine for etoposide with mainly myeloablative conditioning. Methods Patients were offered this regimen if fit for allogenic HSCT and had AML which is refractory to two cycles of chemotherapy or refractory to one cycle and considered at high risk for complication with second cycles. Patients with MDS received this regimens if eligible for transplant with high or very high risk cytogenetics. All patients received cytoreductive chemotherapy consisted of fludarabine 30mg/m2/day x 4 days, Cytarabine 2g/m2/day x 4 days, etoposide 100mg/m2/day x 3days, commenced simultaneously. After 3 days of rest, conditioning chemotherapy consisted of fludarabine 30mg/m2 x 2 days and and IV busulfan 0.8mg/m2 q 6 hours; the number of busulfan doses varied between 8 - 12, depending on patient comorbidity. All patients received 2 doses of ATG at 2.5mg/m2/day on day -3 and -2. All patients received GCSF mobilized peripheral blood hematopoietic cells. Post-transplant GVHD prophylaxis consist of CsA and MMF. CsA was tapered from day+60 and stopped at day +90 in the absence of GVHD. MMF was discontinued between day +30 and day +40. Donor lymphocyte infusions were collected for planned prophylactic DLI. Results Twenty six patients received FLAV-SCT between March 2014 and July 2019. The median age was 38 (14-60); 16 (62%) female. Overall 12 (46%) pts had de novo AML, 10 (39%) pts had secondary or therapy related AML and 4 (15%) pts had MDS. Fourteen (54%) pts had adverse risk cytogenetics include 8 (31%) pts had complex or monosomal karyotype. Patients' characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . All patients had active disease prior to FLAV-SCT. The median time for ANC and platelet engraftment was 14 (10 - 42) days and 17 (10 - 52) days respectively. Day 30 assessment shows CR in 16 (61%) pts and CR/CRi in 17 (65%) pts. Outcomes are summarized in Table 2 . Three patients (12%) developed veno-occlusive disease. Acute GVHD grade II-IV and III-IV occurred in 9 (35%) pts and 2 (8%) pts respectively. Three (12%) patients developed chronic GVHD. Cumulative incidence of NRM at 100 days and 2 years was 8% and 12% respectively. The median OS for all pts was 5.2 months with 2 years rate of 32% (15 - 50). Among responders, the median OS and RFS were 19.2 months and 8.7 months, 2y-OS and RFS were 47% and 25%, respectively (Figure 1) . Conclusion Our result demonstrates that transplant is an effective therapeutic modality in this very high risk refractory AML/MDS patients. Sequential chemotherapy (FLAV) followed by SCT with busulfan at myeloablative dose is tolerable with an acceptable toxicities and encouraging results.
