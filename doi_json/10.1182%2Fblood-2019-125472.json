    "abstract_text": "Paraspeckles are sub-nuclear structures found in the interchromatin space of mammalian cells. The core paraspeckle components include a lncRNA NEAT1 and members of the DBHS family of proteins: NONO, SFPQ, and PSPC1. Paraspeckles and their components play diverse roles in gene regulatory networks, including transcription, alternative RNA splicing, nuclear retention of RNA, and DNA repair. Although a previous study showed the presence of paraspeckles in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), their roles in normal and malignant hematopoiesis remain largely unknown. ASXL1 regulates gene expression through interactions with multiple epigenetic regulators. Somatic mutations in ASXL1 gene occur frequently in myeloid neoplasms. We previously generated a hematopoietic lineage-specific conditional knockin (KI) mouse of a C-terminally truncated form of ASXL1-mutant (ASXL1-MT), and showed that ASXL1-MT inhibited repopulating capability of HSPCs. We performed deep RNA sequencing using HSPCs from ASXL1-MT-KI mice, and found aberrant alternative splicing in multiple genes involved in hematopoiesis. The altered splicing in ASXL1-MT-KI HSPCs included abnormal exon skipping or retention in Runx1, Traf6, Atm, and Dnmt3b. These findings, together with a previous report showing that ASXL1 mutations affect alternative splicing in U937 cells, strongly indicate the involvement of ASXL1 in RNA splicing machinery. Because a previous interactome analysis suggested the association between NONO and ASXL1, we hypothesized that ASXL1 may play a role in RNA maturation processes through interactions with paraspeckle proteins. To test this hypothesis, we examined physical and functional interactions between paraspeckle components and ASXL1. We found that both wild-type and mutant ASXL1 interact with NONO and SFPQ in 293T cells. Interestingly, protein and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) analyses revealed that coexpression of wild-type ASXL1, but not mutant ASXL1, enhanced interactions between NONO and histone H3 as well as NONO and NEAT1. These results suggest that ASXL1 acts as a scaffolding protein that assembles paraspeckle proteins and histones to promote transcription and RNA processing. Importantly, mutant ASXL1 loses this function. Next, we assessed subcellular localization of Nono in HSPCs from control and ASXL1-MT-KI mice. We observed predominant cytoplasmic expression of Nono in ASXL1-MT KI HSPCs, while Nono mainly localized in the nucleus in control cells (Figure 1). In addition, expression of NEAT1_2 isoform, which is essential for paraspeckle formation and maintenance, was substantially downregulated in ASXL1-MT-KI HSPCs. Consistent with these observations, RNA FISH against NEAT1 and immunofluorescence against NONO revealed disrupted paraspeckle formation in ASXL1-MT-KI HSPCs. These data suggest that ASXL1-MT promotes nuclear export of Nono, which results in disruption of paraspeckles in HSPCs. NONO has nuclear localization signal (NLS) at its C-terminus, and it was previously shown that a cytoplasmic C-truncated form of NONO induced senescence in fibroblasts. To assess the effect of forced expression of the cytoplasmic NONO in hematopoietic cells, we transduced vector or a NONO mutant lacking the NLS domain (NONO-\u0394NLS) into c-Kit+ bone marrow cells, and transplanted these cells into recipient mice. NONO-\u0394NLS induced overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced engraftment of bone marrow progenitors as ASXL1-MT did. We then assessed the effect of Nono depletion in ASXL1-MT-KI HSPCs using CRISPR/Cas9 system. We crossed ASXL1-MT-KI mice with Rosa26-LSL-Cas9-KI mice, and c-Kit+ bone marrow cells derived from these mice were transduced with a non-targeting or Nono-targeting sgRNAs. This experiment revealed that Nono depletion reverted the impaired repopulation of ASXL1-MT-KI HSPCs after transplantation. Taken together, these data indicate that the cytoplasmic localization of Nono induced by ASXL1-MT has the negative impact on HSPC function. In summary, this study reveals a novel link between an epigenetic regulator ASXL1 and paraspeckle formation. The aberrant interaction between mutant ASXL1 and NONO results in NONO mislocalization, paraspeckle disruption and HSPC dysfunction. Our findings also suggest potentially important roles for paraspeckles to maintain normal hematopoiesis.
