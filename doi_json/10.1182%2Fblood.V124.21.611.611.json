    "abstract_text": "Genetic alterations of epigenetic regulators have become a recurrent theme in hematological malignancies. In particular, aberrations that alter the levels or distribution of methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me) have emerged as a common feature of a wide variety of cancers, including multiple myeloma (MM). The histone demethylase UTX/KDM6A activates gene expression by removing the H3K27me3 repressive histone mark, counteracting the activity of EZH2, the enzyme that places this modification. UTX somatic inactivating mutations and deletions are found in up to 10% of MM cases; nevertheless, the epigenetic impact of UTX loss in MM and the mechanisms by which it contributes to this disease remain to be elucidated. To ascertain the biological impact of UTX loss, we used a recently identified isogenic cell line pair: ARP-1 ( UTX wild-type) and ARD ( UTX null). UTX -null ARD cells were engineered to express UTX in a doxycycline-inducible manner. UTX add-back slowed the proliferation rate of ARD cells, without affecting their viability. Soft agar assays demonstrated that UTX -null ARD cells have increased clonogenicity compared to UTX -wild-type ARP-1 cells. Re-expression of UTX partially reversed this effect, decreasing the number and size of colonies formed. ARD cells also showed increased adhesion to Hs-5 bone marrow stromal cells and to fibronectin than ARP-1 cells, an ability associated with cell survival and drug resistance. UTX add-back decreased the adhesive properties of ARD cells demonstrating this effect is dependent on UTX loss. Mass spectrometry analysis of the add-back system and a panel of UTX wild-type and mutant MM cell lines showed that global levels of H3K27me are not altered after UTX loss or upon its add-back. Therefore, UTX depletion may alter H3K27me at specific loci, and control the expression of a limited number of genes. To identify the genes and pathways that are altered upon UTX loss, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on the paired MM cell lines and the add-back system. This analysis revealed approximately 5,000 genes differentially expressed between ARP-1 and ARD cells. Re-expression of UTX in the UTX -null ARD cells reversed the expression of approximately 1,400 genes, most of them being upregulated upon reintroduction of UTX. Gene ontology analysis of genes responsive to UTX manipulation identified pathways such as JAK-STAT, cadherin, integrin and Wnt pathways. Many of these pathways are related to cell adhesion properties, correlating with the effects observed in vitro. Some examples of the genes which expression was restored upon UTX add-back are E-cadherin, whose loss has been associated with MM progression; and PTPN6, a negative regulator of the JAK-STAT pathway. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments at UTX target genes revealed a decrease in H3K27me3 and a concomitant increase in H3K4me3 upon UTX add-back, correlating with the observed changes in gene expression. As loss of UTX leads to a failure in the removal of H3K27me3, we hypothesized that UTX -null cells may be more dependent on EZH2 to maintain high H3K27me3 levels at specific loci. Treatment of the paired cell lines with the EZH2 inhibitor GSK343 for 7 days significantly decreased the viability of UTX -null ARD cells, but had no effect on the UTX wild-type ARP-1 cells. This effect was not exclusive to these cell lines, as treatment of a panel of UTX wild-type and mutant MM cells corroborated the increased sensitivity in UTX -mutant cells. RNA-seq of ARD cells treated with GSK343 for 7 days identified approximately 2,000 genes with altered expression in response to this drug, most of them being upregulated upon EZH2 inhibition. These genes partially overlapped with the genes that were responsive to UTX add-back, including E-cadherin, suggesting that treatment with EZH2 inhibitors is somewhat similar to UTX add-back. Collectively, this work demonstrates that loss of UTX alters the epigenetic landscape of MM cells, leading to altered expression of a specific set of genes, ultimately benefiting cells through increased proliferation, clonogenicity and adhesion. Moreover, inhibition of EZH2 partially reverses aberrations promoted by UTX loss and may represent a rationale therapy for the treatment of this type of MM.
