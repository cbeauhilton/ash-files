    "abstract_text": "Background Growth arrest-specific gene 7 ( Gas7 ) first discovered in growth-arrested NIH3T3 cells possesses WW, Fes/CIP4 homology (FCH), and coiled-coil domains, which can act as an adaptor for SH2 or 3-containing proteins. Gas7 is abundantly expressed in the brain and is involved in neuronal differentiation. Recently, Gas7-deficient mouse transiently expressing truncated form of Gas7 mutant protein shows motor activity defects due to reduced motor neuron number (Huang BT et al., PLoS One 2012). Interestingly, MLL-GAS7 resulting from t(11;17)(q23;p13) has been reported in a treat-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in a pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However the specific role of Gas7 in an area of hematology has not been determined yet. Results We found that Gas7-deficient bone marrow (BM)-derived progenitor B cells, grown in vitro in the presence of interleukin 7 (IL-7), display two distinct populations of CD43 high CD25 - and CD43 low CD25 high representing the small pre-B cells compared to their normal counterparts which show only CD43 high CD25 - population. As expected, CD43 low CD25 high population showed reduced IL7R expression on the cell surface and increased expression of intracellular \u00b5HC, Ig\u03b1 and surface Ig\u03b2 compared to CD43 high CD25 - population. Consistent with the high expression of CD25, Gas7 deficient B cell progenitors showed significantly increased expression of \u03ba light chains on cell surface with decreased levels of P-Akt S473 as well as increased levels of P-Erk T202/Y20 , p53 and p21. Moreover, Gas7 mRNA expression was specifically upregulated by >13-fold in pre pro-B (Hardy fraction A) and small pre-B (Hardy fraction D) subsets compared to other subsets of B cell progenitors, suggesting that Gas7 may be involved in the regulation of early B-cell development. To elucidate the function of Gas7 in Ph + B cell lineage leukemia, we transformed bone marrow B cell progenitors from Gas7-deficient mice with BCR-ABL1. Gas7 deficient Ph + ALL cells showed decreased proliferation with reduced S phase and increased apoptosis through the inhibition of Stat5 Y694 phosphorylation as well as increased levels of p21. We found that Imatinib-mediated suppression of Stat5 Y694 phosphorylation dramatically upregulates the expression of Gas7. In agreement with effects of Stat5 on the sensitivity of Ph + ALL cells against tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), Gas7 deficient Ph + ALL cells showed high susceptibility to Imatinib-induced apoptosis. In addition, absence of Gas7 leads to loss of self-renewal capacity and failure to form colonies in methylcellulose assay. Conclusions Here we show that Gas7 may play critical roles in early B-cell development and BCR-ABL1-driven leukemia cell survival. Pathways affected by Gas7 include Stat5, AKT and Erk signaling which is known as a downstream of BCR-ABL1 and as major regulators of B-cell development.
