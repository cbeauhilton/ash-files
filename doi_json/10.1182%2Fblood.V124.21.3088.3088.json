    "abstract_text": "active and well tolerated single agent in the treatment of heavily pretreated Hodgkin lymphoma patients. In this pilot phase II study patients with previously untreated HL underwent sequential regimen consisting in 2 cycles of BV before doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD) +/- radiotherapy (RT). The primary endpoint of the study was the response to BV assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) after the 2 cycles (PET2), defined as reduction of Deauville score or, in case of no change in Deauville score, as any reduction in standard uptake value (SUV) intensity compared to basal SUV. Between April and October 2013, 12 patients with a median age at diagnosis of 36 years (range, 19-70), 11 stage I-IIA and 1 stage IIIA, were enrolled. BV was administered as scheduled and at the full dose of 1.8 mg/kg in all patients. After the 2 cycles of BV, the overall response rate was 91%, comprising of ten (83%) complete responses and one (8%) partial metabolic response. The non responding patient had stage III and showed a new lesion at PET2. After ABVD +/- RT, the overall response rate was 100% with 11 complete responses and 1 partial response (converting from progression disease). At a median follow up of 8 months, all 11 patients are still in complete response, while the remaining one relapsed. During BV therapy, the only grade 3 adverse events were transient and asymptomatic increase in liver transaminases (n=3, 25%) and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (n=2, 17%). During ABVD +/- RT grade III-IV neutropenia occurred in 9 (75%) patients. All toxicities were transient and resolved with growth factor support. Two cycles of BV as first line-treatment in limited stage HL induced an outstanding complete response rate with limited toxicity and reducing the need of chemotherapy. Waiting for a longer follow up to assess the duration of response, our data (sequential administration of immunotherapy and chemotherapy) should be considered the starting point for further studies in first line therapy for limited stage HL patients.
