    "abstract_text": "Background : Clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS) is defined as persistent unexplained cytopenia with evidence of clonality [myeloid-associated somatic mutations (MTs) or cytogenetic [CG] abnormalities] but without definitive evidence of myeloid neoplasms (MN). The outcomes in CCUS patients (pts) are not well understood. Methods : The CCUS International Study database includes pts from 17 institutions who meet the criteria of CCUS and do not have other causes of cytopenia. Pts with MDS defining CG abnormalities were excluded. We collected baseline clinical data, laboratory parameters, CGs, molecular genetics, treatment, and disease course. Diverse gene panels from different institutions were collated to include a total of 70 myeloid-related somatic genes (30 genes in common). 2018 IWG MDS response criteria were used to determine response rate (RR). Disease progression (DP) is defined by progression to MN. The relationship between independent variables and DP and death was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. All statistical analysis was performed using SAS. Results : A total of 258 pts were captured by July 2021. The median age was 71 (IQR 63-77) years, and 66% were male. Among 73 (28%) pts with known malignancy history, 27 (37%) pts received previous chemo- or radiation therapy. 27 (10%) pts had non-malignant hematology comorbidities. 91 (35%) had cardiovascular disease, and 33 (13%) had inflammatory disease. ( Table 1 ) The red blood cell and platelet transfusion-dependent rates were 7.3% and 2.3%, respectively. The median number of MTs was 2 (IQR 1-3), with 221 (86%) pts had \u22651 MT, of which 116 (53%) had \u2265 2 MTs. The most common 5 MTs were TET2 (n=78, 30%), SRSF2 (n=50, 19%), DNMT3A (n=47, 18%), ASXL1 (n=40, 16%), and U2AF1 (n=22, 9%) ( Figure 1 ). The median VAF (mVAF) was 28% (IQR: 9.2%, 43%) with VAF < 10% in 47 (18%) and VAF \u226540% in 78 (30.2%) of the MTs. mVAF of the all genes are shown in Figure 2 . Among pts with CG abnormalities (n=62, 24%), trisomy 8 and -Y are the most common karyotypes (n=15 for each, 24%) (Table 2). Eighty one (31%) patients received various treatments for CCUS with modest RR, including growth factors (n=47, 18.2%, RR: 25.5%), supportive care (n=23, 9%, RR: 26%), immunoglobulin/immunosuppressive therapy (n=15, 6%, RR: 40%), and DNMTi (n=8, 3%, RR=13%). The median length of follow-up was 15.6 (IQR 6.9-30.6) months. 24 pts progressed to MN, 14 (58.3%) of which were MDS, 8 (33.3%) CMML, and 2 (8.3%) AML. The 2-year PFS was 86.1% (95% CI: 80-93%) with a median PFS of 16.3 (IQR: 3.7, 21) months. In the multivariable model, positive MT of KRAS (HR: 8.4, 95% CI: 1.9-36.9, p=0.005) and CBL (HR: 16.5, 95% CI: 3.7-73.8, p=0.003) were significantly associated with DP. In the functional pathway analysis, having at least 1 splicing factor MT was significantly associated with DP (HR: 2.6, 95% CI:1.2-5.9, p=0.02). TP53 was not significantly associated with DP (HR: 1.2, 95% CI: 0.2-8.7, p=0.88). Having >1 MT (HR: 3.57, 95% CI: 1.19-10.7, p=0.02) compared to a single MT was significantly associated with DP (Figure 3). Over the follow-up period, 35 pts died. The 2-year OS was 81% (95% CI: 74.9-87.9%). In the multivariable model, MT of KRAS (HR: 6.1, 95% CI: 1.8-20, p=0.003), CBL (HR: 7.3, 95% CI: 1.7-31, p=0.007 ), and FLT3 (HR: 19.9, 95% CI: 2.5-155, p=0.004) were significantly associated with inferior survival. In the functional pathway analysis, MTs in activated signaling pathway were significantly associated with death (HR: 4.1, 95% CI: 1.8-9, p<0.001). None of the pts with TP53 MT died. Having >1 MT was not statistically significantly associated with higher risk of death (HR: 1.5, 95% CI: 0.7-3.0, p=0.28) ( Figure 4 ). After adjustment for co-MT status and comorbidities, baseline Hb<10 g/dL (HR: 3.7, 95% CI: 1.8-7.9, p<0.001) was significantly associated with greater mortality. Conclusion: This large retrospective study summarizes the CCUS pts' characteristics, with different MT patterns and VAF. We confirmed the impact of having >1 MT on DP, but not OS. Genes involved in activated signaling had a significant impact on both DP and OS. TP53 MT was not associated with worse outcome. Findings may be due to limited cases in the particular genes and different gene panels from multiple institutions. A longer follow-up is planned to further describe the predictors for outcome in this ongoing study.
