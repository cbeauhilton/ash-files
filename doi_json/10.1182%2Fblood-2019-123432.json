    "abstract_text": "Background: Severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID) is a rare disorder caused by ADA gene mutations, leading to lymphotoxic build-up of purine metabolites and profound immunodeficiency. Historically, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been used as a bridge therapy until patients can receive an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), ideally from a matched related donor (MRD) or, if none is identified, a non-matched and/or unrelated donor. We developed a self-inactivating lentiviral vector (LV), denoted EFS-ADA LV, encoding the human ADA cDNA sequence under the control of a shortened human elongation factor 1\u03b1 gene promoter. A fresh or cryopreserved formulation of a drug product (OTL-101), composed of autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) transduced ex vivo with EFS-ADA LV, was evaluated in 2 prospective, non-randomized Phase I/II clinical trials at 2 USA centers. We report on safety and efficacy of OTL-101 in 30 ADA-SCID pediatric gene therapy (GT) subjects treated from 2013-2017 with a median follow up (FU) of 24 months (mo; range 12-26 mo), compared to a historical cohort of 26 ADA-SCID patients treated with HSCT. Methods: UCLA Fresh Study (NCT01852071): Autologous CD34 + HSPCs were isolated from bone marrow and pre-stimulated with cytokines before transduction with EFS-ADA LV to yield OTL-101, which was infused as a fresh formulation in 20 subjects (9 male, 11 female; aged 4 mo-4.3 yrs). Single dose busulfan (4 mg/kg) was administered prior to infusion of OTL-101. Subjects were followed for 24 mo. UCLA Cryo Study (NCT02999984): 10 subjects (4 male, 6 female; aged 5-15 mo) received a cryopreserved formulation of OTL-101, which allowed for an extended shelf-life and full quality control prior to infusion. Busulfan was administered in 2 doses, the first at 3 mg/kg and the second adjusted to target a total area under the curve of 4,900 \u00b5M*min (20 ng/mL*hr). At the time of analysis, all subjects reached 12 mo FU (except 1 subject who was withdrawn from the study due to lack of engraftment); 7 subjects reached 18 mo of FU. Historical Control Group: 26 patients (aged 0.2 mo-9.8 yrs) were treated with allogeneic HSCT (MRDs n=12, non-MRDs n=14) at Great Ormond Street Hospital, UK (n=16) or Duke University Children's Hospital, USA (n=10) from 2000-2016. Results: Sustained engraftment of genetically modified HSPCs was observed in 29/30 GT subjects by 6-8 mo and persisted through FU in both studies, based on vector gene marking in granulocytes and CD3 + T cell reconstitution ( Figure ). Subjects who engrafted maintained long-term metabolic detoxification from deoxyadenosine nucleotides after stopping ERT approximately 1 mo post-GT. At last FU (median 24 mo; range 12-24 mo) in the GT group, overall survival (OS) was 30/30 (100%) and event-free survival (survival in the absence of ERT reinstitution or rescue allogeneic HSCT; EvFS) was 29/30 (97%). OS and EvFS were higher in the GT group at last FU compared with HSCT controls (with or without an MRD) at 2 years (Table). One of 30 OTL-101 subjects (3%) did not engraft and was restarted on ERT; the subject was withdrawn from the study at 5.9 mo and subsequently received a rescue HSCT, whereas 42% of HSCT patients required rescue HSCT, PEG-ADA ERT or died. Among the 20 OTL-101 subjects in the UCLA Fresh Study who reached 2 years FU, 18 (90%) stopped immunoglobin replacement therapy (IgRT), compared to 52% of HSCT patients. Preliminary results were observed in 5/7 (71%) OTL-101 subjects in the UCLA Cryo Study with more limited (18 mo) FU. Twelve OTL-101 subjects experienced one or more serious adverse events, most frequently infections and gastrointestinal events; only 1 of which was considered treatment-related (bacteremia due to product contamination). In the GT group, there were no events of autoimmunity with \u226424 mo FU. Due to the autologous nature of OTL-101, there was no incidence of graft vs host disease (GvHD); in contrast, 8 HSCT patients experienced GvHD events (5 acute, 3 chronic events), 1 of which resulted in death. Conclusions: Based on sustained gene correction and restoration of immune function in all subjects who engrafted, treatment of ADA-SCID with OTL-101 has a favorable benefit-risk profile. Key correlates of engraftment were consistent across the expanded cohort. Importantly, higher rates of OS and EvFS compared with HSCT (with or without an MRD) were observed.
