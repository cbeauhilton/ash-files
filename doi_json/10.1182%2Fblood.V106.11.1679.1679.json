    "abstract_text": "Background: Copper deficiency is an established cause of hematological abnormalities, traditionally described in malnourished infants and persons with malabsorption or short bowel syndromes, particularly those requiring long-term parenteral nutrition. With the recent increase in bariatric (weight reduction) surgery, acquired copper deficiency may be increasing in incidence but the diagnosis is frequently delayed. Methods: To outline the natural history of copper deficiency we searched the Mayo Clinic database and our heavy metals laboratory for patients diagnosed with low serum copper during the years 1974\u20132005. Copper deficiency was defined as a serum level < 0.75 \u03bcg/ml. Results: We identified 123 patients with a low serum copper. 77 patients were excluded as the the hypocupremia was either transient or due to other factors such as Wilson\u2019s disease. The remaining 46 patients were all symptomatic. 25 patients had hematological abnormalities, 20 of these patients also had neurological involvement. 5 had isolated hematological manifestations and 21 patients had isolated neurological findings, most commonly myeloneuropathy. 13 presented with anemia and leukopenia, 5 with pancytopenia, 6 with anemia and 1 with isolated neutropenia. In 10 of the 25 cases, a secondary contributing cause for the hematological findings was identified. These included possible anemia of chronic disease (4), renal insufficiency (2), iron deficiency (1), B12 deficiency (1), GI hemorrhage (1), and splenomegaly (1) while copper deficiency was the only identifiable cause in the remaining 15 patients. Hematological parameters at diagnosis are outlined in the table. 15 of the 25 patients with hematological manifestations had a history of GI surgery, including 6 patients who had bariatric surgery. The median time from surgery to diagnosis was 11.5 years (range 8 months - 45 years) and was shorter for bariatric surgery (10 years, range: 8 months - 25 years) than for non-bariatric surgery (18 years, range: 2\u201345 years). 1 patient had a history of excessive zinc ingestion, 1 had malabsorption secondary to chronic pancreatitis and 1 patient had celiac disease. In 7 cases, no explanation was found. 24 of 25 patients received treatment with oral or intravenous copper, 5 were lost to follow up. In 16 patients the hematologic parameters either improved significantly or normalized, while in the remaining 3 patients there was no improvement. Factors that may explain the lack of response in these patients included splenomegaly (1), renal insufficiency (1) and multiorgan illness (1). Conclusion: Copper deficiency is an increasingly frequent cause of hematological abnormalities, and can manifest with refractory cytopenias with or without associated neurological symptoms. Thrombocytopenia is relatively rare. Previous GI surgery, especially bariatric surgery, appears to be a major causative factor. Most patients will have an improvement in hematological parameters after copper supplementation. Recognition of copper deficiency is therefore assuming greater importance in view of the increasing frequency of bariatric surgery, ease of treatment and potential for irreversible neurological damage if diagnosis is delayed.
