    "abstract_text": "Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients are strongly sensitive to bacterial, fungal and viral infections. Furthermore, MM is often newly diagnosed in the context of such infections. Given those recurrent infections remain a major cause of death of MM patients; we surmised that MM plasma-cells could be activated by microorganisms, therefore contributing to the initiation and progression of the disease. Microorganisms share highly conserved structures called pathogen-associated molecular patterns. They are recognized by a family of receptors that act as sensor for the innate immune system and are called the Toll-like receptor family (TLRs). We first measured the expression of the 10 known human TLRs on 16 human MM plasma-cells lines (HMCLs) and freshly purified Plasma-cells from 13 patients. The expression pattern is heterogeneous among HMCLs and does not correlate with the one of B cells. Indeed TLR-3, 4, and 8 are aberrantly expressed. On the contrary, the expression of TLR-2 and 10 is lost on most of the HMCLs. TLR-1, 7 and 9 are the most frequently expressed (15 + /16, 12 + /16 and 11 + /16 respectively). Primary MM plasma-cells also express TLR-7 (9 + /13) and TLR-9 (8 + /13). Accordingly to this expression profile, culture with TLR-7 ligand (loxoribine) or TLR-9 ligand (hypomethylated DNA from bacteria) increased 1,7 to 6 times (mean 3 \u00b1 1,4 n= 8) the proliferation of IL-6-dependent and independent HMCLs. Furthermore, we observed a resistance to serum-deprivation as well as to dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. Those effects were IL-6-mediated in IL-6-dependent HMCLs since a blocking antibody to IL-6 neutralized the growth and survival induced by TLR triggering. In conclusion, human MM Plasma-cells express a broad range of TLRs and the triggering of TLR-7 and 9 induces tumor cell growth and prevent chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. These effects are mediated by the induction of an autocrine loop of growth factors as IL-6, and others currently under identification in the case of IL-6 independent HMCLs. Thus, MM plasma-cells take advantage of infections to expand and escape to usual therapies.",
