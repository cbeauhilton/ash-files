    "abstract_text": "Background: BIBT 986 is a novel potent anticoagulant that dually inhibits Factors Xa and IIa. We hypothesized that BIBT 986 would dose-dependently decrease endotoxin-induced, tissue factor triggered coagulation activation. Hence it was the aim of the study to compare with placebo the anticoagulant activity of three dosages of BIBT 986 on parameters of coagulation, platelet activation and inflammation and to examine the safety of BIBT 986 in this setting. Methods: This study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group dose escalation trial in 48 healthy male volunteers. Participants were randomised to receive bolus primed continuous infusions of one of the three doses of BIBT 986 or placebo. All of them received a bolus infusion of 2ng/kg body weight lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Results: BIBT dose-dependently increased anti-Xa activity, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT), thrombin time (TT) and the international normalisation ratio (INR). Importantly, BIBT 986 dose-dependently blocked the LPS-induced coagulation as assessed by the in vivo markers of thrombin generation and action: BIBT 986 doses that prolonged APTT by 25% were already effective. The BIBT dose that prolonged APTT by 100%, completely suppressed the increase in prothrombin fragment (F1+2), thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT) and D-dimer. BIBT 986 had no influence on activation markers of inflammation, fibrinolysis, endothelial or platelet activation. Conclusion: Infusion of BIBT 986 was safe and well tolerated. BIBT 986 specifically and dose-dependently blocked LPS-induced, tissue factor trigger coagulation. When compared to different anticoagulants tested previously in this standardized model, BIBT 986 was more effective in suppressing thrombin generation (F1+2 levels) than standard doses of danaparoid, dalteparin or lepirudin. BIBT 986 represents the first drug of a new class of dual FXa and FIIa inhibitors, and displays high potency.",
