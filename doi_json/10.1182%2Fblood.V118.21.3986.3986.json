    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3986 Background: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell neoplasm. Although current lenalidomide (R) and bortezomib containing up-front regimens can now achieve overall response rates approaching 100%, patients eventually relapse with progressively refractory disease. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), in Phase I clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, have shown promising activity when combined with other agents such as bortezomib. Vorinostat, (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid; SAHA) is an oral HDACi, currently FDA approved in the United States for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Here we report the findings of the combination of vorinostat (Zolinza\u00ae), lenalidomide and dexamethasone (ZRD) in multiple myeloma patients who were refractory to RD. Methods: Patients received oral vorinostat 300 mg or 400 mg once daily (days 1\u20137 and days 15\u201321), lenalidomide 10\u201325 mg (days 1\u201321) and dexamethasone 20\u201340 mg weekly (days 1, 8, 15, 22) in a 28-day cycle Subjects: Twenty-nine patients were treated and all were refractory to RD; 76% were refractory to at least one bortezomib containing regimen and 48% were refractory to the combination of VRD. Twenty-six patients (90%) had undergone prior high dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplant. The median number of prior therapies was 4 (range 2\u201313). Results: The overall response rate (ORR) was 24 % with 1 VGPR and 6 PR. The clinical benefit rate (ORR + MR) was 51% including 8 MR. Nine patients (31%) had stable disease. The median duration of response (DOR) was 4 months (range, 0\u201336). The median overall survival (OS) was 11 months (range, 4\u201336). Common toxicities including diarrhea and fatigue (all grades) were 41% and 34% respectively. The incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia was 45 % and grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 34%. Conclusion: The combination of ZRD showed significant activity in patients with RD relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. ZRD was well tolerated and is a viable option for patients who do not respond to lenalidomide-based therapy. Further, since all 3 agents are available in oral formulations, ZRD provides an additional option for those patients wishing to avoid intravenous therapy. Formal phase II studies of this combination are in preparation. Disclosures: Off Label Use: Vorinostat is an oral HDAC inhibitor and is being evaluated in the treatment of Multiple Myeloma.
