    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3158 MicroRNA miR-125b has been shown to be involved in different kind of leukemia. Indeed, the chromosomal translocation t(2;11)(p21;q23) found in patients with myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia leads to an overexpression of miR-125b up to 90 fold. Moreover, miR-125b is also upregulated in patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia carrying the t(11;14)(q24;q32) translocation. To decipher the presumed oncogenic mechanism of miR-125b, we used transplantation experiments in mice. All of the mice transplanted with fetal liver cells ectopically expressing miR-125b showed an increase in white blood cell count, in particular in neutrophils and monocytes, associated with a macrocytic anemia. Among these mice, half of them died of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or a myeloproliferative disorder, suggesting an important role of miR-125b in myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Co-expression of miR-125b and the BCR-ABL fusion gene in transplanted cells accelerated the development of leukemia in mice, compared to control mice expressing only BCR-ABL, suggesting that miR-125b confers a proliferative advantage to the leukemic cells. Thus we showed that the overexpression of miR-125b is sufficient to induce leukemia in vivo and decrease the latency of BCR-ABL -induced leukemia.
