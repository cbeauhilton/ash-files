    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1919 Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is a life saving procedure whose applicability is restricted by the lack of suitable donors, by poor responsiveness to mobilization regimens in preparation of autologous transplantations, by insufficient HSC numbers in individual cord blood units, and by the inability to sufficiently amplify HSCs ex vivo . Characterization of Stemregenin (SR1), an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) antagonist that promotes HSC expansion, provided a proof of principle that low molecular weight (LMW) compounds have the ability to promote HSC expansion. To identify novel putative agonists of HSC self-renewal, we initiated a high throughput screen (HTS) of a library comprising more than 5,000 LMW molecules using the in vitro maintenance of the CD34+CD45RA- phenotype as a model system. Our study was based on the fact that mobilized peripheral blood-derived CD34+CD45RA- cells cultured in media supplemented with: stem cell factor, thrombopoietin, FLT3 ligand and interleukin 6, would promote the expansion of mononuclear cells (MNC) concomitant with a decrease in CD34+CD45RA- population and HSC depletion. LMW compounds preventing this loss could therefore act as agonists of HSC expansion. In a 384-well plate, 2000 CD34 + cells were initially cultured/well in 50\u03bcl medium comprising 1\u03bcM test compounds or 0.1% DMSO (vehicle). The proportions of CD34 + CD45RA \u2212 cells were determined at the initiation of experiment and after a 7-day incubation. Six of 5,280 LMW compounds (0.11%) promoted CD34 + CD45RA \u2212 cell expansion, and seventeen (0.32%) enhanced differentiation as determined by the increase in proportions of CD34 \u2212 CD45RA + cells compared to control (DMSO). The 6 LMW compounds promoting expansion of the CD34 + CD45RA \u2212 cell population were re-analyzed in a secondary screen. Four out of these 6 molecules suppressed the transcriptional activity of AHR, suggesting that these compounds share the same molecular pathway as SR1 in stimulating HSC expansion, thus they were not further characterized. The remaining 2 compounds promoted, similar to SR1 or better, a 10-fold and 35-fold expansion of MNC during 7 and 12-day incubations, respectively. The expanded cell populations comprised 65\u201375% of CD34+ cells compared to 12\u201330% determined for DMSO controls. During 12-day incubation with these compounds, the numbers of CD34+ cells increased \u223c25-fold over their input values, or \u223c 6-fold above the values determined for controls. This expansion of CD34+ cells was associated with a \u223c5-fold increase in the numbers of multilineage CFC (granulocyte, erythroid, monocyte, and megakaryocyte, or CFU-GEMM) compared to that found in DMSO control cultures. The ability of the 2 newly identified compounds to expand functional HSCs is currently being evaluated in vivo usingimmunocompromised mice. In conclusion, results of our initial screen suggest that other mechanism, besides inhibition of AhR, are at play for expansion of human HSC.
