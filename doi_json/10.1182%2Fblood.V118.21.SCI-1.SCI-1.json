    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-1 Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) undergo self-renewal and also generate all types of blood cells, including red cells, myeloid cells, and all immune system cells. Formation of red cells from HSC involves multiple cellular stages, including early erythroid-specific progenitors (burst-forming unit-erythroid [BFU-E]) that respond to several growth factors and an erythropoietin (Epo)-responsive progenitor, and the colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) that in 3 days generates \u223c30 reticulocytes. In adult animals most CFU-E cells undergo apoptosis. A short-term need for red cells is met by increased Epo production by the kidney, which rescues increasing numbers of CFU-Es from apoptosis and increases red cell production over a few days. Chronic stress, such as in certain types of anemias and inflammatory diseases, leads to a marked increase in numbers of HSC and many types of progenitor cells. I will focus most of my talk on stress-triggered BFU-E proliferation and formation of CFU-Es, since our very recent work showed how glucocorticoids \u2013 an important class of stress hormones \u2013 as well as HIF-1\u03b1 stimulate red cell production. Acting synergistically these allow \u223c300 times more CFU-Es and erythroblasts to be formed from each BFU-E. More specifically, these molecules stimulate limited self-renewal of BFU-Es during cell division, thus maintaining progenitor immaturity and allowing over time increased numbers of CFU-E cells and thus mature red cells to be formed. This explains why certain corticosteroids are useful in treating some non-Epo responsive anemias, and I will present a molecular dissection of glucocorticoid and HIF-1\u03b1 action on BFU-E progenitors that has led to the identification of genes critical for self-renewal and that suggest other possible avenues for treatment of chronic anemias.
