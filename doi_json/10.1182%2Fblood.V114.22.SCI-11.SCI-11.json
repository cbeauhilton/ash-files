    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-11 The 5q- syndrome and Diamond Blackfan Anemia are related on a molecular level by ribosome dysfunction. The 5q- syndrome is a distinct subtype of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) associated with isolated, interstitial deletions of the long arm of Chromosome 5. Diamond Blackfan Anemia is a rare congenital disorder associated with bone marrow failure, craniofacial abnormalities, and limb bud defects. The hematologic phenotype of both diseases includes a severe refractory anemia, macrocytosis, and a deficiency of erythroid precursors. Recent evidence indicates that this erythroid defect is caused by RPS14 deletion in the 5q- syndrome, and by mutation of RPS19 or other ribosomal genes in at least 50% of patients with Diamond Blackfan Anemia. In both diseases, deletion or mutation of one allele of a ribosomal protein leads to defects in pre-rRNA processing and defective production of mature ribosomes. In murine and zebrafish models, haploinsufficiency for ribosomal genes phenocopies the erythroid failure characteristic of the human disorders. While the mechanistic consequences of ribosomal dysfunction have not been fully elucidated, the p53 pathway appears to play a central role. MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes the degradation of p53, binds to several ribosomal proteins including RPL11. Deficiency of RPS6, and perhaps other ribosomal proteins, causes an accumulation of free RPL11, that binds to MDM2, preventing MDM2 from interacting with p53, thereby leading to an accumulation of p53. Several other genes that are mutated in hematologic disorders are involved in ribosome biogenesis and function, including SBDS , mutated in Shwachman Diamond syndrome; DKC1 , mutated in some cases of dyskaratosis congenita; and NPM1 , mutated in acute myeloid leukemia and deleted in some cases of MDS. The manner in which each of these genes disrupt ribosome function and cause distinct clinical phenotypes is currently under investigation. Disclosures Ebert: GlaxoSmithKline: Research Funding.",
