    "abstract_text": "Phosphatidylinositol-phosphate kinases (PIPKins) belong to a family of lipid kinase enzymes that generate lipid messengers derivate from inositol, including the second messenger phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], which participates in several cell regulation processes including gene expression. Previous studies developed in our laboratory suggested that the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate kinase-II-alpha (PIP4KII\u03b1) may be related with the expression of the globin genes. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the expression levels of the \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 globin genes after disruption and overexpression of the PIP4KII\u03b1 gene (PIP4KIIA) in KU812 erythroleukemic cell line. The PIP4KII\u03b1 gene disruption was performed by using CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR/dCas9 techniques: KU812 cells were electro-transfected (Lonza 4D Nucleofector) with CRISPR/Cas9 lentiviral plasmid construct containing 3 gRNA targets to exon 8 of PIP4KIIA to knockout the gene; RNA samples from the pool of cells were collected and quantified by qPCR after 9 (t1) and 14 days (t2) of transfection. To overexpress PIP4K2A, CRISPR/dCas9 system (five lentiviral plasmids - 3 gRNAs targeting 214 nt upstream the transcriptional start site of PIP4K2A and 2 SAM accessorial factors) was transfected (Lipofectamine 3000) and RNA quantified by qPCR 24 (h1), 48 (h2) and 72 (h3) hours after the procedure. \u03b2-ACTIN and GAPDH genes were used as endogenous controls for qPCR. Our results with transfected cells without selection revealed, as expected, a reduction of PIP4KIIA compared to the control (no transfected cells - t1 and t2). The \u03b1 globin genes presented a variation of 42% (increase in t1) and a 60% reduction in t2 (RQ = 1.42; RQ = 0.40, respectively), while \u03b2 globin genes presented a 123% increase in t1 and remained similar to the control at t2 (RQ = 2.23; RQ = 1.01). The \u03b3 globin genes presented variation of 18% and 59% reduction in t1 and t2, respectively (RQ = 0.82; RQ = 0.41). The overexpression results suggested that PIP4KIIA leads to a higher \u03b3 globin expression in h2 and h3 (RQ = 3.26; RQ = 2.01) as well as a lower \u03b2 globin expression in h1, h2 and h3 (RQ = 0.54; RQ = 0.002; RQ = 0.18), while a globin remained similar to the control at all analysed times (RQ variation of 1.26; 0.82 and 1.25, respectively). These results, although preliminary, suggest a possible relationship between PIP4KII\u03b1 and the regulation of expression of the globin genes.
