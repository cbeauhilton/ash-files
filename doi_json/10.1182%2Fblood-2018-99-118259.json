    "abstract_text": "Background: The combination of treosulfan witth fludarabine was successfully introduced into toxicity-reduced conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). However, the risk of post-HCT relapse remains of concern. Here we report for the first time on the results of an individual treatment approach with treosulfan, fludarabin and cytarabine as conditioning for allogeneic HCT in patients with AML, MPN or MDS. Methods: 22 patients were treated with fludarabine 30 mg/m\u00b2 given on day -6 to day -2, treosulfan 14 g/m\u00b2 administered on days -4 to day -2 and cytarabin 2g/m\u00b2 given on days -6 and -5. GvHD-prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A and methotrexate or MMF. In addition, antithymocyte globulin was applied in case of an unrelated donor. One patient received bone marrow and the remaining patients received peripheral blood stem cells from matched related donors (9%), matched unrelated donors (73%) or mismatched unrelated donors (18%). All patients were considered to have high risk of relapse because of unfavourable cytogenetic features and/or insufficient or missing response to previous treatment. Three patients (14 %) with CML after blast crisis received the combination because of the reported high relapse rate (46%) after three-day scheduled conditioning with treosulfan [1]. In addition, patients were considered to be ineligible for myeloablative standard conditioning because of multi-morbidity (n = 4; 18% with HCT-CI >2) and/or age >55 years (n = 14; 64%). Results: The median age of patients was 59 (35-68) years. Patients suffered from acute myeloid leukemia (n = 14, 64%), myeloproliferative neoplasia (n = 6, 27%) or myelodysplasic syndrome (n = 2, 9%). The conditioning regime was well tolerated and nearly all patients engrafted and achieved complete donor-type chimerism, except for one who died very early from sepsis. Another patient with underlying myelofibrosis suffered from secondary graft failure on day 100. Two patients developed aGVHD \u00b0III/ IV. None of the patients suffered from veno-occlusive disease or severe chronic GVHD. Overall survival and event-free survival at one year reached 60.2% and 59.6%, respectively. Six patients died from infectious disease, two from relapse and one patient from acute GVHD \u00b0IV. Conclusion: The combination of cytarabine with the established conditioning of treosulfan and fludarabine is feasible in patients with high risk of relapse and ineligible for myeloablative standard conditioning.
