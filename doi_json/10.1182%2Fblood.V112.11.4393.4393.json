    "abstract_text": "Background: The treatment of pediatric Philadelphia positive (Ph+) leukemias in the era of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) continues to evolve with the role of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in these high-risk patients becoming more controversial. Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) prior to imatinib in both pediatric and adult patients has often involved intensive chemotherapy, including consolidative allo-HCT. Whether treatment strategies in 2008 have changed for these Ph+ leukemias in pediatrics, from heavily allo-HCT based to TKI based medical therapy, is presently unclear. Methods: Thirty-two pediatric centers across the United States and Canada were surveyed regarding current treatment practices for Ph+ ALL in order to explore treatment practices in 2008. The survey targeted primary pediatric oncologists and bone marrow transplant physicians regarding their treatment approach for Ph+ ALL in terms of upfront therapy, utility of allo-HCT, use of TKI (including their role in the post-HCT setting) and how response to therapy was monitored. Results: Twenty-three of the thirty-two centers completed the survey to provide a completion rate of 72% (Table 1). Twenty-two of the 27 physicians (81%) reported they do not classify patients by risk group according to age and presenting WBC (e.g. low-, intermediate- or high-risk) but rather use response to therapy to identify high risk patients, initially treating all Ph+ ALL patients the same. Eighty-one percent of survey responders recommended allo-HCT in first remission, when a matched sibling donor was available, for Ph+ ALL. Regarding the use of TKI in the post-HCT setting, 13 of 27 (48%) physicians reported using imatinib as maintenance therapy post-HCT as a means to prevent relapse. All physicians reported using PCR techniques for bcr-abl of either bone marrow, peripheral blood or both to monitor treatment response with frequencies ranging from monthly to every six months. Conclusion: Treatment of pediatric Ph+ ALL appears variable and center dependent. Classifying patients into low-, intermediate- or high-risk disease based on age and presenting WBC was not shown to be standard practice but rather using treatment response to identify high-risk patients. This survey identified a trend toward less allo-HCT in 2008 for Ph+ ALL compared to years past. Despite the trend toward less HCT, the treatment consensus in 2008 for pediatric Ph+ ALL remains MSD allo-HCT when available. Use of imatinib was recognized by all survey responders as standard of care in upfront therapy for Ph+ ALL, but the use of imatinib or other TKI in the post-HCT setting as maintenance therapy remains in question. Prospective pediatric clinical trials will be necessary to determine the optimal strategy for the Ph+ diseases. Table 1.
