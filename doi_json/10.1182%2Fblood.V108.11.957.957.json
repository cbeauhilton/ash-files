    "abstract_text": "In the ABO blood group system any allele which does not give rise to A or B antigen expression is an O allele. The most common O alleles, O 1 ( O01 ) and O 1v ( O02 ) encode enzymatically inactive truncated proteins due to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) compared to the consensus A 1 allele, 261delG. Other O alleles containing the consensus nucleotide at residue 261 have been identified. The most common of these non-deletional O alleles is O 2 ( O03 ). It contains other SNPs which render the resulting protein non-functional. The most significant SNP is 802G>A (G268R); the arginine residue blocks the donor sugar\u2019s access to the active site preventing its transfer. Recently O 2 alleles were proposed to be the most common cause of ABO discrepancies (anti-A lacking or weakened in plasma despite apparent group O phenotype) in automated blood grouping ( Transfusion  2005 ; 45 : 1331 ). Other clinical or biochemical reports have suggested that O 2 may produce small amounts of A antigen on the RBC surface ( Transfusion  2005 ; 45 : 70 , 2005;45:359, J Biol Chem  2005 ; 280 : 525 ). To establish the effect of the O 2 allele on automated ABO typing we extracted DNA from 562 randomly selected group O RBC units that were available for transfusion. Automated forward and reverse ABO grouping was performed on an Olympus PK7231 using A 1 and B cells for reverse typing (Pittsburgh) and the IBG Multisampler Plato 3000 SI system using A 1 , A 2 and B cells (Lund). A PCR-RFLP assay ( Vox Sang 1995 ; 69 : 242 ) involving amplification of exon 6 of the ABO gene followed by cleavage with Kpn I to detect the presence of the 261delG SNP was performed and 34/562 (6%) of these units were heterozygous for a deletional and a non-deletional O allele. All 34 of these donors demonstrated an identical digestion pattern with BstE II which cleaves exon 6 in the presence of the consensus sequence at residue 261, confirming their heterozygosity for a non-deletional O allele. Allele-specific PCR to detect the O 2 -specific 802G>A polymorphism was performed on 32 of these donors for which additional DNA was available; the O 2 allele was uniformly detected along with either an O 1 or O 1v allele. No homozygous O 2 O 2 donors were identified. A sensitive flow cytometric analysis of the RBCs from 7 donors with the O 2 allele was performed using monoclonal anti-A (ES-15) and a PE-labelled rat-anti-mouse kappa Ig secondary antibody. None of these RBCs demonstrated fluorescence levels in significant excess of the control O ( O 1 O 1 ) cells whilst A antigen on group B cells was demonstrable. Manual immediate spin and gel card forward typing was performed on these donors using a variety of murine monoclonal, polyclonal and experimental anti-A reagents; no A antigen was detected on their RBCs. Adsorption-elution studies were performed on the RBCs of 3 donors heterozygous for O 2 using human-source polyclonal anti-A but no A antigen was detected. All 34 group O RBC units were transfused to group O recipients without reported hemolytic reactions. Our results suggest that in its heterozygous state the O 2 allele does not necessarily induce ABO discrepancies in automated testing. Transfusing group O RBCs from donors with an O 2 allele to recipients with anti-A did not result in reports of symptoms associated with hemolytic events in the recipients.",
