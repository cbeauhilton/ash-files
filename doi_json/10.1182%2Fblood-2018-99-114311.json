    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION Using Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone (KRd) combination therapy in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients lead to ~40% minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate. Here, we use KRd in combination with daratumumab (DKRd); and treatment response is assessed with extensive correlative science including parallel bone-marrow-based and blood-based MRD tracking, together with targeted DNA sequencing of baseline bone marrow samples. Primary end-point is to rule out 60% and to target up to 80% MRD negativity rate. METHODS This is a single-arm, Phase II clinical trial based on Simon's optimal two-stage design. The first cohort (twice-a-week carfilzomib) (N=41) has the following treatment schedule: 8 cycles of treatment; 28-day cycles with carfilzomib 20/36 mg/m2 days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16; lenalidomide 25 mg days 1-21; dexamethasone 40 mg weekly cycles 1-4, 20 mg after cycle 4; and daratumumab 16 mg/kg days 1, 8, 15, and 22 cycles 1-2, days 1 and 15 cycles 3-6, and day 1 cycles 7-8. The second cohort (once-a-week carfilzomib) (N=41): 8 cycles of treatment; 28-day cycles with carfilzomib 20/56 mg/m2 days 1, 8, and 15; lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and daratumumab are given at the same doses/schedules as the first cohort. For fit patients, stemcell collection is recommended after 4 to 6 cycles of therapy; DKRd therapy is resumed after collection to a total of 8 cycles DKRd. Treatment response is being assessed with parallel bone-marrow-based (10-color single tube flowcytometry, invivoscribe V(D)J sequencing) as well as blood-based (MALDI-TOF and QTOF-mass spectrometry [MS]) for MRD tracking. Baseline bone marrow samples are evaluated with targeted DNA sequencing for FISH-Seq and somatic mutational characteristics (myTYPE). Here, we present the first stage (N=28) of the first cohort (twice-a-week carfilzomib). We are waiting for the results to mature before the second stage (N=13) of the first cohort can open. The second cohort (once-a-week carfilzomib) is opening for enrollment in August 2018 (N=41). RESULTS The first stage of the first cohort is fully enrolled; 28 patients meeting eligibility criteria were enrolled onto study (14 males, 14 females) between October 2017 and July 2018. Baseline characteristics include; median age 60 years (range 32-80 years); 12(43%) patients had high-risk FISH/SNP signature defined as one or more of the following: 1q+, t(4,14), t(14,16), t(14,20), and 17p-. At the submission of this abstract, 20 patients have completed one or more cycles DKRd; among these, 3 patients have completed all 8 cycles. The median number of cycles delivered is currently 4 (range 1-8). Full assessments with MRD assays have been completed in 3 patients: -Pt #1 obtained complete response (CR) after 3 cycles, and workup after the last cycle of therapy showed MRD-negativity (by 10-color single tube flowcytometry and V(D)J sequencing) in the bone marrow; and peripheral blood (serum) was negative by MALDI-TOF MS after completion of cycle 2. -Pt#2 obtained CR after 4 cycles, however, workup after cycle 5 showed MRD-positivity (by 10-color single tube flowcytometry and V(D)J sequencing) in the bone marrow; and peripheral blood (serum) was positive by MALDI-TOF MS throughout the end of the last cycle. -Pt#3 obtained CR after 4 cycles and after 6 cycles both 10-color single tube flowcytometry and V(D)J sequencing showed MRD-negativity in the bone marrow. However, MALDI-TOF MS detected small abnormal serum proteins in peripheral blood and remained positive throughout the end of cycle 8. Overall, the DKRd therapy is well tolerated and it has similar toxicity profile as KRd. Grade >3 adverse events were hypotension, musculoskeletal deformity, back pain, dyspnea, lung-infection, and febrile neutropenia. So far, 5 patients underwent dose reductions of lenalidomide. CONCLUSIONS In this pre-planned interim analysis of our phase II study, we show that DKRd is a highly effective and well tolerated combination therapy for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. Based on small numbers of patients who have completed the planned DKRd cycles and been evaluated by bone marrow-based MRD and peripheral-blood based assays, we show that highly sensitive protein assays may allow longitudinal MRD tracking in peripheral-blood. At the meeting, we will present updated results using longitudinal testing with MALDI TOF-MS and QTOF-MS on the entire cohort.
