    "abstract_text": "Mistletoe (Viscum album) is one of the most used alternative cancer therapies applied as monotherapy or in combination with conventional therapies. Anti-tumor effects of mistletoe (MT) extracts were related to cytostatic and immunomodulatory effects observed in vitro. Aqueous MT extracts contain the three mistletoe lectins I, II and III as one predominant group of biologically active agents. The MT lectins inhibit protein biosynthesis by inactivating the 60S ribosomal subunit. Mistletoe lectin-I ( ML-I) is one important apoptosis inducing compound. It is a heterodimer that consists of a cytotoxic A-chain (ribosome inactivating protein, RIP type 1) linked by a carbohydrate binding B-chain for cellular lectin uptake. However, although MT is widely used, there is a lack of scientific preclinical and clinical data. Here, we describe for the first time efficacy and mechanism of MT extracts against lymphoblastic leukemia in vitro and in vivo. For this purpose, we first investigated both the cytotoxic effect and mechanism of action of two standardized aqueous MT extracts ( MT obtained from fir trees (MT-A); MT obtained from pine trees (MT-P)) and isolated ML-I , in three human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines ( NALM-6 , sup-B-15 and REH). MT-A, MT-P and ML-I clearly inhibited cell proliferation as determined by LDH reslease assays at very low concentrations ( ML-I LD50 from 0,05 ng/ml to 10 ng/ml depending on the host tree) with MT-P being the most cytotoxic extract. The mechanism of cell death was determined by DNA-fragmentation assays. These indicated dose dependent induction of apoptosis as the main mechanism of cell death. Finally, we evaluated the efficacy of MT-A and MT-P in an in vivo SCID -model of pre-B ALL (NALM-6). For this purpose, mice (n=8/group) were injected i.v. with 1 \u00d7 10 6 NALM6 cells and treated by intraperitoneal injections four times per week for 3 weeks (day 1\u20134; 7\u201311; 14\u201318) at varying doses (1, 5 and 50 mg/Kg (plant weight/body weight)). Mice (n=8) treated with PBS and cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg, once on day 1) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Toxicity, peripheral blood counts, bodyweight and survival was determined over time. Interestingly, both MT extracts in all tested concentrations significantly improved survival (up to 55,4 days) in contrast to controls (34,6 days). Furthermore, no hematologic side effects were observed from this treatment as indicated by completely stable blood counts. Also the body weight of treated animals remained stable over time indicating a complete absence of systemic toxicity in the selected dose range. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time efficacy and mechanism of MT extracts against ALL in vitro and in vivo and hereby provide an important base line for the design of clinical trials with these compounds."
