    "abstract_text": "Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare hematologic malignancy with dismal clinical outcomes. Conventional chemotherapies were previously shown to have some clinical efficacy, however, long-term outcomes of BPDCN patients remain poor. In a recent clinical trial, SL-401 demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 90% in previously untreated BPDCN patients. Despite promising outcomes observed in SL-401 studies, there remains a lack of data regarding the optimal first-line therapy. In this single institution retrospective study, we explored the survival outcomes based on front-line treatment and allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). A total of 49 patients with confirmed diagnosis of BPDCN were included in the study. Median age at diagnosis was 71.4 (32.0-91.4) years with a male predominance (82%). Among these, 11 (22%) patients had concurrent hematologic neoplasms at the time of BPDCN diagnosis. The most common site of disease involvement was skin (n=42, 86%) followed by bone marrow (BM) (n=32, 65%), lymph node (LN) (n=13, 27%), and nasopharynx (n=2, 4%) with 14 (29%) and 5 (10%) patients having skin and BM involvement only, respectively. Of note, 17 (35%) patients had both skin and BM disease and 8 (16%) had simultaneous skin, BM, and LN involvement. In the front-line setting, CHOP-based regimens, hyper-CVAD, and SL-401 were used in 10 (20%), 11 (22%), and 12 (24%) patients, respectively. The median cycle number of SL-401 treatment was 6 (1-73). Allo-SCT was performed in 10 (20%) patients and 4 (8%) patients received autologous stem cell transplant (auto-SCT). Transplant was performed following first-line therapy in 11 patients (CR, n=10; PR, n=1) and second-line therapy in 3 patients (CR, n=3). Among 21 vs. 12 patients who received chemotherapy vs. SL-401 as their first-line therapy, a total of 11 (52%) and 3 (25%) patients underwent transplant. A total of 23 (55%), 13 (31%), and 6 (14%) patients achieved a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and progressive disease (PD), respectively. CR rate was higher in patients who were treated with hyper-CVAD compared to others, however, it was not statistically significant (50% in CHOP-based regimens vs. 91% in hyper-CVAD, P =0.064; 50% in SL-401 vs. 91% in hyper-CVAD, P =0.069). The median PFS was 9.9 months and the median OS was not reached when all patients were included for the analyses. In the subgroup analyses, patients who were treated with hyper-CVAD had longest PFS compared to patients treated with CHOP-based regimens (HR=0.217, 95%CI=0.050-0.933, P =0.003) or SL-401 (HR=0.385, 95%CI=0.126-1.179, P =0.075) although the PFS difference between hyper-CVAD and SL-401 did not reach the statistical significance. There was no PFS difference between SL-401 and CHOP-based regimen treated groups (HR=0.931, 95%CI=0.321-2.70, P =0.894). In the OS analysis based on first-line therapy, there was no difference between patients treated with SL-401 compared to patients treated with chemotherapy regimens (HR=1.597, 95%CI=0.460-5.548, P =0.431). Further, there was no OS difference between individual types of front-line therapies ( P =0.678). In contrast, patients who received allo-SCT showed significantly longer OS outcomes compared to patients with no transplant (HR=0.160, 95%CI=0.0453-0.56, P =0.041). Additional OS analyses based on age (<60 vs. \u226560) (HR=0.481, 95%CI=0.146-1.582, P =0.258), ASXL1 mutation (HR=1.705, 95%CI=0.2773-10.48, P =0.5649), or presence of previous or concurrent hematologic malignancy (HR=2.97, 95%CI=0.65-13.57, P =0.1602) did not show any statistical difference. In a multivariate Cox model (adjusting for age, front-line therapy, gender, and transplant) allo-SCT was significant factor for OS (HR=0.137, 95%CI=0.020-0.959, P =0.045). In conclusion, our study supports current recommendations of using SL-401 or hyper-CVAD as the first-line treatments followed by consolidation with allo-SCT in the eligible responders to induction therapy to further improve survival outcomes in BPDCN patients.
