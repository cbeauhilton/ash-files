    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) need to properly balance self-renewal and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation or HSC exhaustion. We recently showed that the presence of specific Cbx proteins in the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) plays a crucial role in balancing self-renewal and differentiation of murine HSCs. Whereas Cbx7 induces self-renewal, Cbx4 and Cbx8 instead induce differentiation. In this project, we investigate the role of various CBX Polycomb proteins in human normal and malignant hematopoiesis. We aim to identify genes which are controlled by CBX7 in normal and malignant human hematopoiesis. Methods: We overexpressed CBX2, -4, -6, -7 and -8 in human CD34 + HSPCs. We assessed functional consequences by measuring cobblestone area-forming cell (CAFC), colony-forming unit (CFU) frequencies, and performed stem cell xenotransplantation studies in NSG mice. To identify genes which are controlled by CBX7 or CBX8, we performed RNA- and Chip-Seq in CD34 + HSPCs. To explore the role of CBX7 in leukemic cells, we performed short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of protein expression in leukemic cell lines. Results: Overexpression of CBX7 and CBX8 in human CD34 + HSPCs led to a significant 5-10-fold increase of week 5 CAFC (fold increase: 9,62 for CBX7; 4,92 for CBX8) and 1,5-fold increase CFU-frequencies (fold increase: 1,32 for CBX7; 1,41 for CBX8) after 14 days. In contrast, overexpression of CBX4 and CBX2 led to equal or decreased CAFC- and CFU-frequencies. Transplantation of CBX7 overexpressing human CD34 + HSPCs in NSG mice led to higher long-term engraftment in comparison to the empty vector control (p<0,05 after 18 weeks). Even after one week of in vitro culture of CBX7-overexpressing CD34+cells significant engraftment levels were obtained. Conversely, downregulation of CBX7 in various leukemic cell lines resulted in markedly decreased proliferation and strongly induced differentiation. Expression analysis showed that genes that are upregulated upon CBX7 overexpression are preferentially expressed in primitive stem cells, and are repressed in more differentiated cell types. Conclusions: Our study indicates that CBX7 and CBX8 regulate self-renewal of human HSPCs. Furthermore, our data show that repression of CBX7 markedly inhibits proliferation of leukemic cells and can release the differentiation block of leukemic cells in vitro . Collectively our results indicate that targeting CBX7 may be a viable strategy to induce terminal differentiation of leukemic cells. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
