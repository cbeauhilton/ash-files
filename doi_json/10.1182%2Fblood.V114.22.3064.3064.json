    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3064 Poster Board III-1 Both ETV6-RUNX1 ( TEL-AML1 )fusion and hyperdiploidy (>50 chromosomes) of lymphoblasts are favorable outcome predictors in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In 433 children with ALL diagnosed at our hospitals between 1997 and 2007 in Taiwan, the frequency of ETV6-RUNX1 fusion was 15.8%, and the frequency of hyperdiploidy (>50 chromosomes) was 14.1%, both were lower than those of the West. While ETV6-RUNX1 fusion had borderline favorable impact on outcome ( p =0.053-0.061), hyperdiploidy showed significant favorable impact on event-free survival (91.1% vs 76.6 %, p = 0.016) in our patients. A meta-analysis from literature enrolled reports in which the case numbers and frequency of ETV6-RUNX1 fusion or hyperdiploidy in childhood ALL were described. It revealed that the frequency of ETV6-RUNX1 fusion in childhood ALL in Far East (Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Chinese in Singapore, and Taiwan) was 14.2% (127/893, range 10-17%), significantly lower than 21.8% (152/697, range 19-27%) in the West (USA, Germany, Italy, France and Chile) ( p < 0.0001). The frequency of hyperdiploidy in Japan and Taiwan was 15.2% (140/921, range 13-20%), significantly lower than 31.6% in the West (977/3,158, range 19-34%) (USA, UK and Germany) ( p < 0.0001). So far as we know, there were several articles, including ours, addressing that the frequency of ETV6-RUNX1 fusion in childhood ALL was lower in a Far East country. This is the first meta-analysis to demonstrate that the frequency of ETV6-RUNX1 fusion in childhood ALL in Far East was lower than that in the West. There was no report on that the frequency of hyperdiploidy in Far East was lower than that in the West. This is also the first meta-analysis to demonstrate that the frequency of hyperdiploidy in childhood ALL in Far East is significantly lower than that in the West. The nature of these differences, probably due to racial, needs further study. In Far East, with both a lower frequency of ETV6-RUNX1 fusion, and a lower frequency of hyperdiploidy, it warrants renewed effort to cure a higher proportion of children with ALL.
