    "abstract_text": "A new method of graft manipulation based on physical removal of \u03b1\u03b2 + T cells and CD19 + B cells, leaving mature NK cells and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the graft, has been recently developed for HLA-haploidentical HSCT. We demonstrated that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells collected from transplanted patients are endowed with capacity of killing leukemia cells after ex vivo treatment with zoledronic acid (ZOL). Thus, we hypothesized that infusion of ZOL in patients receiving this type of graft, may boost \u03b3\u03b4 T cell cytotoxic activity against leukemia cells. Thirty-three patients were treated with ZOL every 28 days at least twice. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells before and after ZOL treatments were studied till at least 7 months after HSCT by high-resolution mass spectrometry, flow-cytometry, and degranulation assay. Proteomic analysis of \u03b3d T cells purified from patients showed that, starting from the first infusion, ZOL caused up-regulation of proteins involved in activation processes and immune response, paralleled by down-regulation of proteins involved in proliferation. These findings are consistent with an induction of V\u03b42 cell differentiation, paralleled by increased cytotoxicity of both V\u03b41 and V\u03b42 cells against primary leukemia blasts. Furthermore, a proteomic signature was identified for each individual ZOL treatment. Patients given 3 or more ZOL infusions had a better probability of survival in comparison to those given 1 or 2 treatments. In conclusion,ZOL influences V\u03b42 cell activity, determines a specific proteomic signature and enhances anti-leukemia activity, this potentially resulting into an increased anti-tumor effect.
