    "abstract_text": "Platelet adhesion to the site of vascular injury is essential to prevent blood loss. The initial step of adhesion is mediated by the glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex on the platelet surface, binding von Willebrand factor (VWF) on the exposed subendothelium. This interaction is transitory, resulting in platelet rolling, and elicits \u201cinside-out\u201d activation of the integrin \u03b1II\u03b23, thus instigating stable arrest of platelets on fibrinogen and/or VWF and their subsequent spreading and aggregation. The GPIb-IX-V complex consists of 4 polypeptides: GPIb\u03b1 disulfide linked to GPIb\u03b2, GPIX, and GPV. While recent effort has focused on elucidation of GPIb-IX-V-generated signals, much remains to be learned. Each component of the complex is a type I transmembrane protein, possessing a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Of these, GPIb\u03b1\u2019s is the longest at 96 amino acids, and associates with both signaling molecules (PI 3-kinase and Src kinase) and structural proteins (filamin A and 14-3-3\u03b6). Yet, the GPIb\u03b1 cytoplasmic sequence lacks domains used by other receptors to recruit signaling molecules. Its only tyrosine residue, at amino acid 605, is not within a known consensus sequence for phosphorylation. However, 10 serine and 8 threonine residues are contained within the cytoplasmic domain. Of these, S587, S590, and S609 are known to be stably phosphorylated in resting platelets and to facilitate 14-3-3\u03b6 binding. S609 does not reside in a consensus motif for phosphorylation, whereas S590 and S587 are within consensus motifs for Casein kinase I and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), respectively. Two other residues, T547 and S566, also reside within consensus sites for PKA. PKA has previously been demonstrated to phosphorylate S166 of GPIb\u03b2 and thereby inhibit platelet function. We hypothesized that phosphorylation of GPIb\u03b1 by PKA also regulates platelet function and 14-3-3\u03b6 binding. To test this, we produced a recombinant protein comprising the cytoplasmic domain of GPIb\u03b1 (amino acids 515\u2013610) fused to glutathione S-transferase at its N-terminus and evaluated the ability of PKA to phosphorylate the protein in vitro. Once we established that PKA could indeed phosphorylate the protein, we produced the recombinant in bacteria also expressing the PKA catalytic domain in an effort to phosphorylate the recombinant GPIb\u03b1 cytoplasmic domain de novo to avoid cumbersome in vitro phosphorylations and increase the yield. Analysis using a phosphoS609 antibody demonstrated that GPIb\u03b1 was phosphorylated on S609. We also examined 14-3-3 binding to wild type and mutant GPIb\u03b1 expressed as part of the GPIb-IX complex in CHO cells (CHO\u03b1\u03b2IX) by evaluating which proteins were pulled down with GST-14-3-3\u03b6 from lysates. 14-3-3\u03b6 was able to pull down wild-type GPIb\u03b1, but only 5\u201310% as much of GPIb\u03b1 S609A. Combined mutation of T547 and S609, each to A, completely abrogated 14-3-3\u03b6 binding, as did combined mutation to A of T547, S566, S587, S590 and S609. Interestingly, approximately 20% residual binding was observed for GPIb\u03b1 S587A/S590A and GPIb\u03b1 T547A/S587A/S590A/S609A. These results indicate that PKA phosphorylates T547, S566, S587, S590 and S609 in vitro and at least S609 de novo in bacteria. They also demonstrate that 14-3-3\u03b6 can associate with the cytoplasmic tail of GPIb\u03b1 via residues T547, S566, S587, S590 and S609. This suggests a complex pattern of functional regulation of the GPIb-IX-V complex by PKA mediated through differential binding of 14-3-3\u03b6, involving both GPIb\u03b1 and GPIb\u03b2."
