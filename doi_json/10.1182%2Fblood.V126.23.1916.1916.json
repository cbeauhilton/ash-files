    "abstract_text": "Fludarabine 120-160 mgs/m2 plus melphalan 140 mgs/m2 (Flu- Mel) is a well known reduced intensity conditioning protocol used in allogeneic transplantation, however it can be no enough intense to treat high risk acute leukemia, specially in the relapse setting. On the other hand, 400 cGy of total-body irradiation (TBI 400) has been successfully added to myeloablative dose of fludarabine busulfan without excessive toxicity. We designed a regimen adding TBI 400 to usual dose of Flu-Mel with the idea to increase its anti-leukemic activity. Below we present our experience Methods and patients Peripheral blood stem cells were mobilized with figrastim for 5 days, later, 1 or 2 apheresis were done to achieve a minimum of 3 million of CD34 + cells/kg. The conditioning consisted of fludarabine 30-40 mgs/m2 for four days, melphalan 140 mgs/m2 one dose, on day - 1, TBI 400 was administered split in 2 fractions. The prophylaxis against graft versus host disease (GVHD) was done with cyclosporine and methotrexate, all patients were given pegfilgrastim 22 patients were transplanted, median age 26.5 years (range 8-49), the diagnosis were; acute lymphoblastic leukemia (13), acute myeloid leukemia (6), chronic myeloid leukemia (1), high risk myelodisplasia(1), mixed acute leukemia(1). 32% were in first remission, 41% in second, 27% were in third or they had active disease. The discrimination according CIBMTR disease risk index (CIBMTR-DRI) was: 54% high risk, 41% intermediate and 5% low Results All donors were matched siblings, a median of 10 millions/kg of CD34+ cells were infused; all patients engrafted, the neutrophil and platelet recovery occurred on days +11 and + 14 respectively. The grade III toxicity was; mucositis, 45% and one case of encephalopathy, there were not any case of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. The incidence of GVHD acute (GII-IV) and chronic extensive was 10 and 25%. With a median follow up of 11 months (range 6-30) the overall survival (OS)(Kaplan-Meier) at 24 and 36 months is 69 and 55% . Six patients have died, one due to sepsis and five secondary to relapse. The OS according to CIBMTR-DRI at 36 month was 75 and 46% for intermediate and high risk groups Conclusion: The addition of TBI 400 to Flu- Mel regimen is feasibly, the main toxicity is mucositis, the non- relapse mortality is very low and the incidence of GVHD, acute a chronic, is not higher than expected This combination shows an encouraging anti leukemic effect, as it is demonstrated by an OS of 75 and 46% in patients classified in intermediate and high risk CIBMTR DRI groups. This preparative protocol can be a low toxicity alternative to more conventional myeloablative regimen. It warrants further studies Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
