    "abstract_text": "Background: The addition of rituximab (R) has improved results for pts with relapsed DLBCL who undergo high-dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT (Khouri, JCO, 2005). Recently, the incorporation of radio-labeled antibodies such as Yttrium 90 ( 90 Y) Ibritumomab Tiuxetan (Zevalin\u00ae) to conditioning regimens has been evaluated. Herein, we compare the outcome in pts treated with these 2 regimens. Methods: Pts with relapsed chemosensitive DLBCL were treated on 2 consecutive trials. Between 1999 and 2003, 53 pts were enrolled on a protocol with BEAM combined with R at 1000 mg/m 2 and on days +1 and +8 after ASCT (R-BEAM). Between 2004 and 2006, 25 pts were entered onto a trial of Zevalin given at the fixed dose of 0.4 mCi/Kg on day -14 followed by BEAM (days \u22127 to \u22121) with R on days +1 and +8 after ASCT (Z-BEAM). Both groups received R during stem cell collection at a dose of 375 mg/m 2 the day before chemotherapy for stem cell mobilization and at 1000 mg/m 2 7 days later. There was no statistical difference in age, sex distribution, # of prior therapies between the 2 groups. LDH, PET and remission status at transplant were comparable. However, serum b2- microglobulin level was higher in R-BEAM pts [median 2.2 vs 1.9, (p=.02)] and they were also more likely to have an IPI \u2265 1: 39% vs 8% (p=0.005). Results: Median follow-up: 18 mos (range, 6\u201335) in Z-BEAM and 52 mos (range, 21\u201374) for R-BEAM. Both groups were staged with CT, PET scan and marrow biopsies, every 3 mos for a year, and then every 6 mos. OS and DFS @ 2 yrs were 92% (95% CI, 72\u201398) and 84% (95% CI, 62\u201393) for Z-BEAM vs. 83% (95%CI, 70\u201391) and 72% (95% CI, 57\u201382) for R-BEAM ( P = 0.5 for both OS/DFS). Within the R-BEAM group, PET status and IPI at transplant were important prognostic factors for OS {91% vs 50% for PET (\u2212) and (+), P = 0.004; 94% vs 67% for IPI 0 vs. \u22651, P = 0.02} and DFS. DFS of pts with IPI 0 were 86% vs 81% for Z-BEAM and R-BEAM, respectively ( P = 0.9). A comparison for high IPI pts could not be done due to the small number of such pts in the Z-BEAM group. DFS for pts who were PET (+) were 75% vs 44% within the Z-BEAM and R-BEAM groups, respectively: a difference that did not reach significance due to the small number of pts (4 vs 10). Treatment-related mortality was comparable with only one early death within the Z-BEAM group due to sepsis. Results suggest a faster WBC recovery with Zevalin {ANC > 500, day +9 vs. day +11 (p<0.001)}. However, results may be confounded by the use of different cytokines. Platelet engraftment was similar in both groups. Conclusions: Fixed dose Zevalin of 0.4 mCi/kg can be added to BEAM without increasing toxicity. Z-BEAM and R-BEAM have comparable results in relapsed chemosensitive DLBCL pts with IPI 0 and PET (\u2212) at transplant. Pts with IPI \u2265 1 and PET (+) have suboptimal results with R-BEAM. Randomized trials are needed to address whether the addition of Zevalin for these pts may improve their outcome."
