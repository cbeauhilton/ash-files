    "abstract_text": "Background Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a heterogeneous group of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). PTCL accounts for approximately 10% of all NHL cases in the US and Europe, and may be as high as 24% in Asia. The most common frontline treatment of PTCL is anthracycline-based chemotherapy with CHOP or CHOP-like regimens which do not produce durable remissions in the majority of subtypes, including ALK+ systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) with high International Prognostic Index (IPI) scores. Brentuximab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate directed against CD30 currently approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory sALCL with demonstrated antitumor activity in frontline PTCL. A phase 1 trial combining brentuximab vedotin with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (CHP [CHOP without vincristine to eliminate additive neurotoxicity]) as frontline treatment of PTCL demonstrated estimated 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of 52% and 79% (Fanale 2018). Based on the encouraging activity and manageable safety profile of the combination, the ECHELON-2 trial was initiated to compare the efficacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin in combination with CHP (A+CHP) versus standard CHOP for the treatment of patients (pts) with PTCL (ClinicalTrials.gov No. NCT01777152). Here we report the blinded, pooled analyses per investigator of the ECHELON-2 trial. Methods ECHELON-2 is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter study. Adults with newly diagnosed CD30+ (\u226510% of neoplastic cells by local review) PTCL were enrolled. Pts with ALK+ sALCL were required to have an IPI \u22652. The primary endpoint of ECHELON-2 is PFS per an independent review facility. Pts were randomized 1:1 to receive 21-day cycles of either CHOP or A+CHP for 6 to 8 cycles. Consolidative SCT or radiotherapy was permitted at the investigator's discretion after end of treatment. Results A total of 452 pts across 17 countries were randomized between January 2013 and November 2016 in Europe (44%), North America (29%), and other (26%) regions including Asia and Australia. The median age was 58 years (range, 18-85) and 63% were male. Most pts were white (62%) or Asian (22%). Most pts entering the study had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (39% each) and the remaining 22% of pts had a performance status of 2. Most pts had advanced-stage disease (Stage III [27%] or IV [53%]) at diagnosis and 78% had IPI scores \u22652 (2 [34%], 3 [29%], 4 [12%]. 5 [3%]). PTCL subtypes included sALCL (316 pts [70%]: ALK+ 98 pts [22%]; ALK- 218 pts [48%]), PTCL - not otherwise specified (72 pts [16%]), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (54 pts [12%]), adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (7 pts [2%]), and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (3 pts [1%]). Of the 452 randomized pts, 449 received at least 1 dose of study treatment and all pts had either completed (82%) or discontinued treatment as of April 2017. Treatment was discontinued for adverse events (AEs) (7%), progressive disease (7%), investigator decision (2%), and patient decision (2%). Preliminary results by investigator assessment, show an overall blinded pooled objective response rate (ORR) following completion of the frontline treatment of 79% (95% CI: 75.4-83.1) with 64% achieving a complete response (CR) (95% CI: 59.1-68.2). With a median follow-up of 35.2 mos, the 3-year PFS and OS for all pts were 52.9% (95% CI: 47.7-57.7) and 73.1% (95% CI: 68.3-77.2). The incidence of AEs was consistent with the known safety profiles of brentuximab vedotin and CHOP chemotherapy, including the AE of interest, peripheral sensory neuropathy (43%). Grade 3 or higher AEs reported in \u226510% of pts were neutropenia (33%), febrile neutropenia (17%), and anemia (12%). Conclusions ECHELON-2 is the largest prospective, randomized, double-blind study to compare the efficacy and safety of standard CHOP with an alternative regimen that includes a CD30-targeted agent in frontline treatment of sALCL and other CD30+ PTCLs. Blinded pooled data from ECHELON-2 show that the treatment was well tolerated with encouraging 3-year PFS and OS rates. The primary analysis by treatment regimen will be unblinded prior to the meeting and presented at the conference.
