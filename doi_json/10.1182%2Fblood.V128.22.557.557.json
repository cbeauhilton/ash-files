    "abstract_text": "We are studying a novel mechanism by which prototypical erythrocyte proteins also act in endothelial cells to regulate vascular tone. Previously, we reported that the alpha subunit of hemoglobin (\u03b1Hb) is expressed in the myoendothelial junction of endothelial cells in resistance arterioles where it binds endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) and degrades NO, thereby stimulating vasoconstriction. To extend this observation, we examined arterioles of mice lacking 2 out of 4 \u03b1 globin genes [HbA 1 knockout * \u03b1 2 /* \u03b1 2 ]. Compared to wild type (wt) controls, the thoracodorsal artery (TDA, a resistance arteriole) from mutant animals exhibited abnormal morphology with thinned internal elastic lamina, excessive dilation, and reduced contractility after treatment with the vasoconstrictor phenylephrine (EC50 8.2e -6 M -1 n=6 in wt vs 2.3e -5 M -1 n=6 in mutant; p<0.0001). Wild type TDAs expressed \u03b1Hb (Fig. 1A), but not \u03b2Hb mRNA and protein. However, free \u03b1Hb is unstable and not expected to exist as an isolated monomer. Alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) is a molecular chaperone that binds free \u03b1Hb, stabilizes its structure and facilitates assembly of HbA tetramers (\u03b12\u03b22) in red blood cells. Immunohistochemistry showed that AHSP and \u03b1Hb co-localize in endothelial cells lining the TDA. In the TDA of Ahsp knockout (KO) mice, \u03b1Hb immunostaining was disorganized and reduced in intensity (Fig. 1A), and Western blotting showed reduced \u03b1Hb protein compared to wt controls. Moreover, TDAs from Ahsp KO mice exhibited abnormal thinning of the internal elastic lamina, excessive dilation (lumen diameter 7500 \u03bcM 2 in Ahsp KO vs 4100 \u03bcM 2 in controls; n=5 mice, p=0.0037) and reduced constriction after phenylephrine treatment (EC50 9.6e -6 M -1 in wt n=7 vs 5.6e -6 M -1 in mutant n=6; p<0.0001) (Fig. 1B-C), similar to what we observed in HbA 1 -/- mice. To examine physical and functional interactions between AHSP, \u03b1Hb and eNOS, we expressed fluorescent-tagged proteins in cultured human coronary ECs. \u03b1Hb-GFP alone was expressed at relatively low level (mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) = 631) (Fig. 1D). Coexpressed mCherry-AHSP colocalized with \u03b1Hb-GFP and increased its expression level (MFI 5312) (Fig. 1D). Similarly, coexpressed mCherry-eNOS colocalized with \u03b1Hb-GFP and enhanced its expression (MFI 1519) (Fig. 1D). Purified \u03b1Hb co-immunoprecipitated with AHSP or eNOS, but not both, suggesting mutually exclusive interactions. Overall, our studies provide genetic evidence that \u03b1Hb expressed in arteriolar endothelial cells regulates blood vessel tone in vivo . Moreover, biochemical studies show that AHSP stabilizes endothelial-expressed \u03b1Hb and facilitates its assembly with eNOS. Thus, AHSP acts as a molecular chaperone for \u03b1Hb in erythrocytes and endothelial cells to promote the formation of HbA (\u03b12b2) for O 2 transport, and \u03b1Hb-eNOS for NO degradation. We hypothesize that the \u03b1Hb-AHSP-eNOS axis functions to fine-tune systemic blood pressure and/or regional blood flow to specific vascular beds. Defining the magnitude of these effects in mice and humans during specific circulatory stresses and in \u03b1 thalassemia is an important and interesting topic for future investigation.
