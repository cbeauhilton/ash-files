    "abstract_text": "Beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) are congenital anemias caused by mutations in the beta-globin gene, resulting in either reduced/absent production of globin chains or abnormal hemoglobin structure. At present, the definitive cure is represented by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with a probability to find a well-matched donor of <25%. Experimental gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies is based on transplantation of autologous hematopoietic stem cells genetically modified to express therapeutic hemoglobin levels. Approaches to genetically modify HSCs for treatment of hemoglobinopathies include: 1) the addition of globin genes by lentiviral vectors and 2) gene editing by nucleases to reactivate fetal hemoglobin either through inhibition of repressors or by reproducing mutations associated with high fetal hemoglobin levels. The outcomes of early clinical trials are showing the safety and potential efficacy, as well as the hurdles still limiting a general application.Current challenges and improved strategies will be presented and discussed.
