    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND Monocytes and macrophages (mo/m\u03a6) are a key part of the composition of peripheral blood (PB) and tissues and increased numbers of mo/m\u03a6 have been associated with patient outcome in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Because CD14 is abundantly expressed on the surface of human mo/m\u03a6, it is often used to identify or isolate human mo/m\u03a6, and immunosuppressive CD14+HLA-DR low monocytes have been shown to be increased in the peripheral blood of NHL patients. However, we have previously shown that CD14 expression on mo/m\u03a6 is substantially lower than CD68 expression suggesting that many CD68 + mo/m\u03a6 are CD14 negative, especially in spleen and lymph node tissues. To characterize both CD14 + and CD14 - mo/m\u03a6 in PB and tissues, we isolated all mo/m\u03a6 from B-cell NHL specimens and normal controls and assessed their phenotype and function. METHODS Human mo/m\u03a6 were isolated by negative selection from PB and tissue biopsy specimens (B-cell NHL and normal tissues) using the immunomagnetic isolation (monocyte enrichment kit). Morphological and immunophenotypic characteristics of isolated mo/m\u03a6 were determined by Giemsa stain and flow cytometry. Phagocytosis and migration assays were used to determine the function of isolated mo/m\u03a6. T cells were co-cultured with mo/m\u03a6 and T cell proliferation was evaluated by CFSE staining and detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS Using a monocyte enrichment kit to isolate all mo/m\u03a6, the purity of isolated mo/m\u03d5 was 85~99%, which was defined by the percentage of lineage-negative cells (i.e. cells without expression of CD3,CD19, CD20, and CD56). We found that these isolated mo/m\u03a6 constituted 2 populations: a more frequent population of larger cells and a less common population of smaller cells. In contrast to PB, CD14 positive mo/m\u03a6 constituted less than 40% of the tissue mo/m\u03a6 from the isolated population. Furthermore, we found that the cell size from CD14 + mo/m\u03a6 were larger than CD14 - mo/m\u03a6. Using CD14 and SIRP-\u03b1, we could identify 3 populations of mo/m\u03a6: CD14 + SIRP-\u03b1 high , CD14 - SIRP-\u03b1 dim and CD14 - SIRP-\u03b1 - cells. CD14 + SIRP-\u03b1 high cells and CD14 - SIRP-\u03b1 dim cells typically constituted the population of larger cells, while CD14 - SIRP-\u03b1 - cells constituted the population of smaller cells. CD14 - SIRP-\u03b1 - cells lacked the typical phenotypic markers and had decreased phagocytic and migratory ability compared to CD14 + SIRP-\u03b1 high and CD14 - SIRP-\u03b1 dim cells. Furthermore, we found that these 3 populations of mo/m\u03a6 had a differential effect on activated T-cells and that the CD14 - SIRP-\u03b1 - cells appeared increased number in biopsy specimens from NHL when compared to normal tissues. CONCLUSIONS We have identified a unique population of small CD68+ mo/m\u03a6 that lack expression of CD14, SIRP-\u03b1, and other Fc\u03b3R markers. This subset of mo/m\u03a6 is more prevalent in NHL tissues and has limited phagocytic and migratory functions. This CD14 - SIRP-\u03b1 - mo/m\u03a6 subpopulation may play an inhibitory role in anti-cancer and inflammatory responses. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
