    "abstract_text": "The bone marrow microenvironment provides functional and structural support for both normal and leukemic hematopoietic stem cells. Importantly, the marrow microenvironment is known to be hypoxic. Given the many critical functions of HIF-1\u03b1, we investigated HIF-1\u03b1 levels in leukemic cell lines and primary AML blasts. Surprisingly, HIF-1 \u03b1 expression was non-detectable in AML cells grown in suspension cultures under normoxic (21% O 2 ) or hypoxic (1% O 2 ) conditions. Normoxic co-cultures with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal (MSC) or MS5 cells likewise did not induce HIF-1\u03b1, but hypoxic co-culture conditions induced HIF-1\u03b1 protein without changes in HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation. Functionality of HIF-1\u03b1 was confirmed by concomitant increase in the levels of glucose transporter glut-1, the HIF-1\u03b1 downstream target. Inhibition of stroma-leukemia cell interactions with the small molecule CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3465 (Genzyme/Anormed) at 100 nM completely abrogated the induction of HIF-1\u03b1 in HL-60 and MOLM13 AML cells. While SDF-1 was unable to induced HIF-1\u03b1 under normoxic conditions, it did so under both physical (1% O 2 ) and chemical (COCl 2 ) hypoxic conditions, in two different cell lines. Inhibition of P13K (with LY294002) or MEK/ERK signaling (with CI-1040) abrogated HIF-1\u03b1 induction under hypoxic conditions. Immunohistochemical staining of bone marrow samples from primary AML confirmed the presence of HIF-1\u03b1 in leukemic cells localized adjacent to bone-lining stromal elements. Results suggest that the bone marrow microenvironment of AML is hypoxic in vivo ; in leukemia cells HIF-1\u03b1 induction under low oxygen tension depends on the presence of stromal cells; HIF-1\u03b1 induction is dependent on SDF-1/CXCR4 and is mediated by activation of P13K and MAPK signaling. Altogether these findings suggest that SDF-1\u03b1/CXCR4 interactions contribute to the survival of leukemic cells via specific induction of HIF-1\u03b1 signaling by the bone marrow microenvironment. Disruption of these interactions via CXCR4 inhibition strategies may suppress multiple pro-survival HIF-1\u03b1 targets in leukemic cells.",
