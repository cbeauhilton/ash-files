    "abstract_text": "We have previously shown that the primary cell cycle defect in the inherited, cancer-prone, bone marrow failure associated disease, Fanconi anemia (FA), is not in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, as had been thought for many years, but rather in the S phase. FA cells challenged with the DNA cross-linking agent, psoralen coupled with long wavelength, ultraviolet (UVA) radiation (PUVA), fail to slow their progression through the S phase of the subsequent cell cycle, as do normal cells. FA cells are extremely sensitive to the cytotoxic and clastogenic effects of DNA cross-linkers, such as PUVA, so much so that the diagnosis of FA is based on an assay, the \u201cDEB test\u201d, in which cells are examined for clastogenic and cytotoxic effects of diepoxybutane (DEB), a DNA cross-linking agent. More recently, we have shown that artificially slowing the cell cycle of FA cells exposed to PUVA by subsequent treatment with agents which slow their progression through S phase leads to markedly increased viability and reduced chromosome breakage in vitro. We now show that similar results can be obtained in vivo in patients with another DNA repair deficiency disease, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a recessively inherited disorder associated with defective repair of sunlight induced adducts in the DNA of sun-exposed tissues followed by development of numerous mutations causing large numbers of cancers in these same tissues. We treated two patients with XP, a light complected black male and a white female, both 14 years of age, in sun-exposed areas with 5-fluorouracil, an inhibitor of DNA synthesis, daily for three months. In contrast to normal patients, who only show clinical results if an inflammatory response is invoked, marked improvement in the clinical appearance of the skin was seen with no inflammation observed. This effect was confirmed histologically by examining epidermis adjacent to excised lesions in sun-exposed areas and further verified by computerized image analysis. Treatment with agents that slow progression through S phase, such as hydroxyurea, may similarly improve clinical outcomes in patients with FA or others who are developing bone marrow failure.",
