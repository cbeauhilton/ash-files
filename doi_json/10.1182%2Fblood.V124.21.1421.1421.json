    "abstract_text": "We have shown that complement component 3 (C3) is expressed in malignant ovarian epithelial cells and enhances cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo . C3 is secreted by cancer cells into the tumor microenvironment and promotes tumor growth through an autocrine loop. To understand the mechanism of upregulation of C3 expression in malignant epithelial cells, we studied the transcriptional regulation of C3, and found that TWIST1, a major regulator of EMT, binds to the C3 promoter and regulates C3 transcription. Knockdown of the TWIST1 gene reduced C3 mRNA, and TWIST1 overexpression increased C3 mRNA. TWIST1 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during normal development and in metastasis of malignant tumors. An important marker of EMT is a reduction in the surface expression of E-cadherin on cells facilitating migration and invasion of these cells. TWIST1 is a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin; and because TWIST1 increases C3 expression, we investigated whether C3 is also a negative regulator of E-cadherin expression. We overexpressed C3 in ovarian cancer cells by stable transduction of lentivirus carrying C3 cDNA. Overexpression of C3 was associated with 32% reduction in the expression of E-cadherin resulting in enhanced migration ability of cells by 2.3 folds and invasiveness by 1.75 folds, as compared to control cells transduced with control lentivirus. To investigate whether TWIST1-induced reduction in E-cadherin is C3-mediated or not, we studied the effect of TWIST1 overexpression simultaneous with C3 knockdown in ovarian cancer cells. Overexpression of TWIST1 alone resulted in 70% reduction in E-cadherin mRNA and this was completely reversed after simultaneous C3 knockdown in these cells. To investigate the correlation between C3 and TWIST1 in vivo , we studied the co-expression of these two proteins in mouse embryos (physiologic EMT) and in malignant tumors (pathologic EMT). Given the role of EMT in embryogenesis we immunostained mouse embryos at different stages of development, using antibodies against TWIST1 or C3. Transverse section of 9.5-day post-coitum (9.5dpc) mouse embryos showed co-expression of TWIST1 and C3 in otocyst (ot) and hindbrain (hb) of neural crest. In the whole-mounted 11.5dpc mouse embryos, C3 and TWIST1 were co-expressed in limb buds. Given the role of EMT in malignancy, tumors induced in mice after intraperitoneal injection of murine ovarian cancer cells were resected and immunostained for C3 and TWIST1 proteins. TWIST1 and C3 co-localized at tumor edges, where EMT and tumor cells migration occur. Taken together, these data provide evidence that TWIST1 regulates C3 expression, and C3 promotes EMT through E-cadherin. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
