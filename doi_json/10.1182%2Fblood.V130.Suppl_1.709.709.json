    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is widely used as a life-saving treatment for malignant and non-malignant blood disorders. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are a major contributing cell population for a successful HCT. While cord blood (CB) is an acceptable source of HSCs for clinical HCTbecause of its many advantages including prompt availability, lower incidence of GvHD and virus infection, CB HCT is usually associated with slower time to engraftment especially in adult patients when compared with other cell sources; this is partly due to limiting numbers of HSCs in single cord units. In order to overcome this limitation, ex vivo expansion of CB HSCs has been evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies for improvement of the clinical efficacy of CB HCT. While a number of different ways have been evaluated to ex-vivo expand human HSCs, little is known about the mechanisms involved, and whether efficient expansion of CB HSCs could be achieved by metabolic reprogramming. In a compound screen for potential candidates which could promote ex vivo expansion of CB HSCs, we found that PPAR\u03b3 antagonist GW9662 treatment significantly enhanced ex vivo expansion of CB phenotypic HSCs (~5 fold) and progenitor cells (HPCs) (~6.8 fold) in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and cytokines (SCF, FL, TPO) when compared with vehicle control. GW9662 significantly increased numbers of CB colony-forming unit (CFU) granulocyte/macrophage (GM) (~1.8 fold) and granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM) (~3.2 fold) progenitors after 4 days ex vivo culture. To assess whether the ex vivo expanded CB HSCs enhanced by the PPAR\u03b3 antagonist were functional in vivo , we performed both primary and secondary transplantation in immunocompromised NSG mice. Engraftment of CB CD34 + cells in primary recipients was significantly increased (~3 fold) both in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) by the cultured cells treated with GW9662. The percentages of both myeloid and lymphoid lineages were enhanced in BM of primary recipients transplanted with GW9662-treated CB CD34 + cells. We also transplanted CB CD34 + cells transfected with control shRNA or PPAR \u03b3 shRNA into NSG mice, and consistently found that both myeloid and lymphoid chimerism was enhanced in BM of recipients which were infused with PPAR \u03b3 shRNA transfected-CD34 + cells compared with control shRNA transfected-CD34 + cells. Long term reconstituting and self-renewing capability of GW9662-treated CB CD34 + cells with both enhanced myeloid and lymphoid chimerism, was confirmed in PB and BM in secondary recipients. Limiting dilution analysis was performed to calculate SCID-repopulating cells (SRC), a measure of the number of functional human HSCs. The SRC frequency of GW9662-cultured CB CD34 + cells was 4 fold greater than that of day 0 uncultured CD34 + cells, and 5 fold increased above that of vehicle-treated CD34 + cells with cytokines alone. To gain mechanistic insight into how PPAR\u03b3 antagonism enhances expansion of human CB HSCs and HPCs, we performed RNA-seq analysis. Antagonizing PPAR\u03b3 in CB CD34 + cells resulted in downregulation of a number of differentiation associated genes, including CD38 , CD1d , HIC1 , FAM20C , DUSP4 , DHRS3 and ALDH1A2 , which suggests that PPAR\u03b3 antagonist may maintain stemness of CB CD34 + cells partly by preventing differentiation. Of interest, we found that FBP1 , encoding fructose 1, 6-bisphosphatase, a negative regulator of glycolysis, was significantly down-regulated by GW9662, which was further confirmed by RT-PCR, western blot and flow cytometry analysis. GW9662 significantly enhanced glucose metabolism in CB HSCs and HPCs without compromising mitochondrial respiration. Enhanced expansion of CB HSCs by antagonizing PPAR\u03b3 was totally suppressed by removal of glucose or by inhibition of glycolysis. Importantly, suppression of FBP1 greatly promoted glycolysis and ex vivo expansion of long-term repopulating CB HSCs (~3.2 fold). Overexpression of FBP1 significantly suppressed enhancedexpansion and engraftment of CB HSCs by PPAR\u03b3 antagonist. Our study demonstrates that PPAR\u03b3 antagonism drives ex vivo expansion of human CB HSCs and HPCs by switching on FBP1 repressed glucose metabolism and by preventing differentiation. This provides new insight into human HSC self-renewal, and suggests a novel and simple means by which metabolic reprogramming may improve the efficacy of CB HCT.
