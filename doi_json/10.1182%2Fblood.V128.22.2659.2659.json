    "abstract_text": "DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are the most dangerous genomic lesions that can be induced by endogenous and exogenous sources. DNA damage response determines cellular fate decisions following DSBs and can lead to cell death or cell survival. Incorrect DSB repair via canonical Non-Homologous End Joining (cNHEJ) or Alternative NHEJ (Alt-NHEJ) is the main source of oncogenic aberrations, including leukemogenic translocations, DNA sequence deletions and insertions. The long life span of Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSC) and their practically unlimited potential for self-renewal requires efficient strategies to cope with DNA damage to eliminate erroneous genetic information inheritance to daughter cells. Although the critical importance of maintaining genome integrity for normal hematopoiesis and prevention of leukemogenesis has been established, definitive analysis of DNA damage response and its mutagenic outcomes in human HSC and Progenitors in response to DSBs is missing. Here we repot that human cord blood purified HSC (defined as CD34+CD38-CD45RA-) are exquisitely sensitive to irradiation (IR)-induced apoptosis in contrast to committed progenitors (defined as CD34+CD38+) as validated by PARP cleavage induction. Interestingly, pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK prevented, whereas CHK2 inhibitor (PV1019) failed in altering apoptosis onset of irradiated HSC. Strikingly, CHK2 inhibitor blocked IR-induced apoptosis in cycling HSC, suggesting differential wiring of DNA damage induced apoptosis in quiescent versus mitogenically stimulated HSC. To characterize cNHEJ repair pathway and its mutagenic potential in live primitive hematopoietic cells we analyzed I-SceI endonuclease induced tandem DSBs joining capacity using DNA repair reporter assay. We found that HSC exhibit inferior cNHEJ capacity as compared with committed progenitors. By decreasing DSBs persistence we revealed that progenitors utilize to the higher degree than HSC the mutagenic component of cNHEJ pathway that results in DNA deletions. We identified HSC-specific contribution of CHK2 kinase activity in limiting incorrect DNA ends joining. Blockade of apoptosis induction also led to the selective increase in mutagenic NHEJ in HSC. On the other hand, inhibition of DNA-PK led to increased oncogenic repair in progenitors only. Importantly, we revealed that HSC utilized mutagenic Alt-NHEJ pathway that depends on microhomologies search and extensive DNA ends processing less efficiently than Progenitors. Thus, our results indicate that oncogenic consequences of DSBs repair in HSC are distinctly minimized by the non-redundant cell death and CHK2 dependent mechanisms. More broadly, these findings will help to elucidate additional repair modifiers and the mechanism by which HSC contend with genotoxic stress.
