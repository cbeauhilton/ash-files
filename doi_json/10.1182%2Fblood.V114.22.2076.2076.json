    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2076 Poster Board II-53 Background Recently, further refinement of the \u201cunfavorable\u201d cytogenetic category in AML demonstrated that a \u201cmonosomal karyotype\u201d (MK+) \u2013 defined as two or more distinct autosomal chromosome monosomies or one single autosomal monosomy in the presence of structural abnormalities \u2013 carries a markedly inferior prognosis to that of a \u201cnon-monosomal karyotype\u201d (MK-) \u2013 defined as a group with various non-core binding factor (CBF) cytogenetic abnormalities but who are MK negative ( J. Clin Onc 26:4791). This finding was based on data from patients predominantly with de novo AML. We analysed data from a phase II trial of patients with sAML to examine whether the monosomal karyotype is also predictive of poor outcome in sAML patients. Methods The karyotypes of pre-treatment blast cells from previously untreated sAML patients on a phase II study were reviewed to identify categories of core binding factor karyotype (CBF), normal karyotype (CN), MK+ and MK- (as defined above), and compared to clinical outcomes. Patients on the study all received induction therapy with amonafide 600 mg/m 2 /day IV days 1-5 and cytarabine 200 mg/m 2 /day IV days 1-7. Consolidation consisted of stem cell transplant (HSCT, n=10) or intermediate-dose (IDAC, n=13)/high-dose (HiDAC, n=7) cytarabine, depending on age and available HSCT donors. Results 88 patients were treated. 2/88 (2%) were CBF, 29/88 (33%) were CN, 16/88 (18%) were MK+ and 31/88 (35%) were MK-. Patients with CBF and the 10 patients with unknown karyotype at baseline were excluded from the analysis. CR+CRi rate by karyotypic group was 19/29 (66%) for CN, 11/31 (35%) for MK-, 2/16 (13%) for MK+ (CN vs MK- p<0.05; CN vs MK+ p<0.05; MK- vs MK+ p=0.09). Median duration of remission was 282 days for CN, 304 days for MK-, and not reached for the 2 MK+ patients who achieved CR (p=NS). Median overall survival: 304 days CN, 145 days MK- and 144 days MK+ (Log rank test for survival: CN vs MK- p=0.07; CN vs MK+ p<0.05; MK- vs MK+ p=0.06).

Importantly, the 2-year overall survival in the MK+ group was significantly inferior to that in the CN group. Of note durable complete remissions were observed in responders regardless of karyotype. Though the number of patients in this study is relatively small, to our knowledge this is the only prospectively defined study of sAML patients demonstrating a significantly adverse impact of monosomal karyotype as compared with other \u201cunfavorable\u201d karyotypes. Further data to address the prognostic and predictive significance of specific cytogenetic abnormalities in sAML will be obtained from a currently enrolling 450-patient phase III randomized trial of amonafide + cytarabine vs daunorubicin + cytarabine in patients with sAML (ACCEDE).
