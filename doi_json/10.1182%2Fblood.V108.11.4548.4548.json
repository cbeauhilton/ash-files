    "abstract_text": "AVE9633 is an immunoconjugate created by conjugation of the cytotoxic maytansinoid, DM4, to the monoclonal IgG 1 antibody, huMy9-6 (average of 3.5 molecules of DM4 per antibody). The huMy9-6 antibody is a humanized version of a murine monoclonal antibody, My9-6, which is specific for the CD33 antigen expressed on the surface of myeloid cells, including the majority of cases of AML. Because CD33 has little expression outside the hematopoietic system, it represents an attractive target for antibody-based therapy in patients with AML. The humanized antibody, huMy9-6, binds to the CD33 antigen with an apparent K D in the range of 10 \u221210 M. Maytansinoids are anti-mitotics that inhibit tubulin polymerization and microtubule assembly, inhibiting cells during the G2/M phase of the mitotic cycle. In order to link maytansinoids to antibodies via disulfide bonds, a new thiol-containing maytansinoid (DM4) was synthesized. Attachment of potent maytansinoids to an antibody via disulfide bonds provides a satisfactory stability in the bloodstream. After the conjugate is bound at the specific tumor site it is internalized and the cytotoxic agent is released within the target cell. A phase I study of AVE9633 is being conducted in patients with refractory/relapsed CD33+ AML. The study regimen consists of AVE9633 IV infusion on Day 1 of a 3 weeks cycle. To date dose levels of 15 (N=3), 30 (N=5), 50 (N=4), 75 (N=4), 105 (N=2), 200 (N=3) and 260 (N=1) mg/m 2 have been investigated. Hypersensitivity reactions during perfusion were noted, requiring prophylaxis with steroids. No other AVE9633- attributable extramedullary Grade 3 AE has been observed to date. Free DM4, measured by LC/MS/MS was detectable from the 75 mg/m 2 dose level; its C max (at the end of infusion) increased from 10 ng/mL at the 75 mg/m 2 dose level to 70 ng/mL at 200 mg/m 2 . Neither AVE9633-associated myelosuppression nor responses have been noted. Using Flow Cytometry Assay on peripheral blasts and monocytes, total saturation and down regulation of CD33 were observed following administration of doses \u2265 30 mg/m 2 . AVE9633 exposure (measuring, by ELISA method, all antibodies containing at lease one molecule of DM4) increased proportionally with the administered dose in the dose range 15 to 200 mg/m 2 . Updated PK results and potential explanations for the lack of efficacy using this treatment schedule will be presented.",
