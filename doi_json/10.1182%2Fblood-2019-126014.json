    "abstract_text": "Background : A regimen comprising of fludarabine, cytarabine, G-CSF (FLAG) has been our frontline treatment for patients with core binding factor acute myelogenous leukemia (CBF-AML) since 2007, initially in combination with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (FLAG-GO) (at 3 mg/m 2 on day 1 in induction and and in 2 of the planned 6 post-remission cycles) and after withdrawal of GO from US market in combination with idarubicin at 6 mg/m 2 on days 3 and 4 in induction and in one post remission cycle during cycles 3-6 (FLAG-Ida). Fusion transcripts, RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or CBFB-MYH11, were assessed at base line and monitored every 2-3 months by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) during consolidation therapy. Results : Between April 2007 and January 2018, 162 patients (Inv 16 =84, 8;21= 78) with newly diagnosed CBF-AML have been treated, median age 49 years (range, 19-78 years, 15% older than 65 years). Fifty-seven (35%) patients were treated with FLAG-GO. Amongst all patients, 95% (N=154) achieved complete remission (CR), 6 (4%) achieved CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) and 2 patients died within first 4 weeks. Of the planned total of 7 cycles of therapy, median number of cycles of therapy delivered is 5 (range 1-7); prolonged cytopenias being the limiting factor in delivery of all planned cycles. With median follow up of 6.5 years, the 5 year overall survival (OS) is 71% and relapse free survival (RFS) is 75%. Patients treated with FLAG-GO and FLAG-Ida were comparable in age, cytogenetic subgroups and presence of kinase (KIT, FLT3, RAS) mutations. OS was not significantly different (p=.7) among treatment regimens but RFS was significantly better among patients treated with FLAG-GO (p=.02) (Fig.1). RFS at 5 years was 87% with FLAG-GO regimen while the same was 68% for FLAG-Ida regimen. Presence of KIT (p=.6) or any kinase mutation (KIT,RAS or FLT3) (p=.8) did not impact RFS. Reduction of fusion transcript ratio by 3 log at end of induction (p=.01) (Fig.2), by 4 log at end of cycle 3-4 (p=.03) and end of all cycles (p=.001), resulted in better RFS. FLAG-GO regimen but not cytogenetic subgroups was associated with better reduction in fusion transcript. Seventy-six percent of patients treated with FLAG-GO achieved reduction of fusion transcript to <0.01 by mid-consolidation while the same was 42% for patients treated with FLAG-Ida (p=0.002). Conclusion : FLAG-GO or FLAG-Ida regimen results in high remission rates among patients with newly diagnosed patients with CBF-AML with low induction mortalities. Induction consolidation with FLAG-GO results in better RFS and quantitative reduction in fusion transcript ratio, compared to FLAG-Ida. Serial quantitative monitoring of fusion transcript identifies patients with better chances of sustained remission.
