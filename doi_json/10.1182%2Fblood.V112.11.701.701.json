    "abstract_text": "Three thousand fifty four children with NCI SR ALL were enrolled on CCG-1991; 2075 eligible patients were randomized and began treatment with intrathecal cytarabine, vincristine (V), dexamethasone (DX), and pegylated asparaginase (ASP). Bone marrow status was assessed at Day 7 and 14, and 28 of Induction. Slow early responders (SER\u2019s) (Day 7/14 M3-M3, or M3-M2; and M2 at Day 28 Induction) received rescue daunorubicin and were assigned to augmented BFM therapy ( N Engl J Med  1998 ; 338 : 1663 ). Other patients were designated rapid early responders (RER\u2019s) and randomly allocated to V/ intravenous methotrexate versus oral 6MP/oral methotrexate, and DX pulses in months 3\u20134 and 7\u20138 of therapy and single or double delayed intensification. The 5-year EFS for RER\u2019s and SER\u2019s was 90.5% (SE \u00b1 1.0%) and 84.7% (SE = \u00b13.7%). Eight hundred three patients elected to participate in a companion study of minimal residual disease (MRD), which was successfully performed on BM samples of 750 patients (93.4%). Out of 1362 BM submitted samples, 1360 were successfully tested. MRD was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR of clone-specific immunoglobulin heavy chain, immuno-globulin kappa deleting element, and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements on Day 14 Time Point (TP #1) for patients not achieving M1 status at Day 7, end Induction (TP #2) and Day 84 (RER\u2019s) or Day 119 (SER\u2019s) (TP #3), i.e., Day 28 of Interim Maintenance). Various levels of MRD positivity were explored for prognostic significance (see Table). At TP\u2019s 1, 2, and 3, 14%, 57%, and 78% had undetectable MRD with sensitivity of 0.01% or better. At the three time points patients with detectable MRD were 2.7 to 4.3 times more likely to fail than patients with undetectable MRD. TP #1, however, unlike TP #2 and TP #3 was not predictive of EFS in our study. Patients who had MRD > 0.01% at TP#1 had a much lower EFS at 4 years if at TP #3 MRD persisted at > 0.01% vs \u2264 0.01% (78 \u00b1 0.1% vs 94 \u00b1 0.05% , p = 0.01). We assessed MRD by PCR at three TP\u2019s in a homogeneous population of children with SR ALL receiving V/ DX/ASP. At end of induction, 57% of patients were MRD negative but still accrued 1/3 of adverse events.  . Time Point 1 . Time Point 2 . Time Point 3 . MRD . Day 14 (Induction Day 14) .
