    "abstract_text": "Background: Gene therapy for hemophilia offers the possibility to ameliorate disease severity to a mild or functionally curative state through a single administration. Etranacogene dezaparvovec (AMT-061) is an investigational gene therapy for hemophilia B comprising an adeno associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) vector containing a codon-optimized Padua variant human factor IX (FIX) gene with liver specific promoter. Aims: We have previously shown a single dose of etranacogene dezaparvovec to provide sustained FIX activity into the mild-to normal range for up to 52 weeks post-dose in participants with severe or moderate-severe hemophilia B. This time, 2 years of follow-up data will be presented for the first time. Methods: A Phase 2b, open-label, single-dose, single-arm, multi-center trial (NCT03489291) in adult hemophilia B subjects. Interestingly, participants were not excluded based on neutralizing antibodies to AAV5. All subjects received a single intravenous dose of etranacogene dezaparvovec (2x10 13 gc/kg) and will be followed for 5-years. The primary endpoint was FIX activity at Week 6. Secondary endpoints include e-diary recordings of bleeds and FIX concentrate use, laboratory parameters, joint health, patient reported outcomes, and adverse events (AEs). Results: All participants had FIX \u22641% (severe or moderately-severe FIX deficiency), required routine FIX prophylaxis, and had neutralizing activity to AAV5 at baseline. Following AMT-061 treatment, FIX activity increased rapidly to a mean of 31% at Week 6. At Week 52, mean FIX activity increased further to 41% with FIX activity levels of 50%, 31% and 41% in participants 1-3 respectively. There was no relationship between the presence of anti-AAV5 NAbs and response to etranacogene dezaparvovec. As of 52 weeks, there were no bleeds post-treatment and no requirement for FIX replacement aside from protocol-specified use for perioperative management in participant 3. There were no clinically significant elevations in liver enzymes and no participants required steroids related to the treatment. One participant experienced 2 mild AEs possibly related to treatment shortly after dosing (self-limiting headache and slightly elevated CRP). One patient had hip surgery due to worsening of pre-existing avascular necrosis deemed unrelated by investigator to etranacogene dezaparvovec and received FIX per protocol according to standard clinical practice. No participant developed inhibitors to FIX. Updated results to 2 years of follow-up will be presented with the main focus on FIX activity, FIX replacement therapy use and reported bleeds. Conclusions: Patients with AAV5 NAbs were included in the Phase 2b etranacogene dezaparvovec trial and have shown sustained FIX activity into the mild-to normal range. All participants were able to discontinue routine prophylaxis, and there have been no bleeds post-treatment with etranacogene dezaparvovec.
