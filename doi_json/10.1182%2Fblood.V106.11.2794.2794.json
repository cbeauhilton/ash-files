    "abstract_text": "Background: CHIR-258 is an orally active small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor which exhibits potent single digit nanomolar inhibitory activity against multiple RTKs involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis (IC 50 <=10 for VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, C-KIT, and FLT-3). Approximately 30% of AML patients have a FLT-3 mutation (ITD-internal tandem duplication or catalytic domain) which drives the malignant process and confers a worse prognosis. Additionally, the inhibition of the angiogenesis component of the disease could be beneficial in all cases. Preclinical data have shown FLT3 ITD models to be ~25 fold more sensitive than FLT3 WT (Menezes, et al, Blood 2005). Our hypothesis was that AML blasts carrying FLT-3 mutations would be exquisitely sensitive to CHIR-258, but that there may also be activity against patients with wild type (wt) FLT-3. Methods: CHIR-258 was administered orally to adult patients with relapsed/refractory AML on a 7 on/7 off schedule followed by continuous daily dosing for 28 days (1 cycle). Subsequent 28-day cycles of continuous dosing were permitted. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments were serially performed and drug tolerability assessed. Results: As of May 2005 8 patients have been treated in 2 (50mg and 100 mg) cohorts of 3\u20136 patients [median age: 62 years (range: 46\u201372), sex: 4M/4F, median prior relapses = 1 (range: 1\u20133), FAB subtypes: M 1 \u20131, M 2 \u20132, M 5 \u20131, M 6 \u20132, unclassifiable-1, no information-1] Five patients remain on study with a median number of treatment cycles=3 (range=1\u201311). There have been no DLTs to date. Dose escalation to 200 mg has been tolerated and accrual continues. Drug related adverse events include fatigue, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, and headache and were generally mild (CTC G1-2). Of the 8 patients treated, 1 had FLT-3 ITD mutation and 7 were wt for ITD and D835. A patient with AML-M6 with wt FLT-3 continues with stable disease after 11 cycles of therapy and was dose escalated from 50mg to 100mg after 8 cycles. The patient with FLT-3 ITD mutation treated at the 100mg dose had near complete clearing of blasts from marrow and peripheral blood. This patient later died due to a presumed fungal infection, not attributed to CHIR-258. Plasma exposure and Cmax increase proportionally across the dose range, and Cmax at the 100mg dose level is in the range where antitumor activity was seen in a preclinical oncogene addicted tumor models for FLT-3 ITD AML (MV4;11). Conclusions: CHIR-258 has demonstrated activity in relapsed refractory patients with AML, both with a FLT-3 mutation and wt FLT-3. Accrual continues at the 200mg dose cohort and updated data will be presented at the meeting.",
