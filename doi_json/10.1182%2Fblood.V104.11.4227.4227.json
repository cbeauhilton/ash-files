    "abstract_text": "The efficacy of epoetin alfa (EPO) 40,000 U SC once weekly (QW) has been established in clinical studies in anemic patients (pts) with cancer receiving chemotherapy (CT). Higher starting doses of EPO may increase initial hemoglobin (Hb) response and subsequent less frequent maintenance dosing may improve dosing flexibility for pts and health care providers. This ongoing, open-label, multicenter, 24-week (wk) study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EPO at a starting dose of 60,000 U SC QW to a target Hb of 12 g/dL in the Initiation Phase (IP; maximum of 12 wks), followed by 80,000 U SC every 3 wks (Q3W) in the Maintenance Phase (MP) to maintain Hb in the range 11.5\u201312.5 g/dL. Eligible pts were \u226518 years with nonmyeloid malignancy, had baseline (BL) Hb 11.0 g/dL but 11.0 g/dL but 13 g/dL or Hb increase >1.3-g/dL in 2 wks. Thirty-five percent (24/69) of pts had a dose of EPO held at any time during the study for Hb >13 g/dL or another reason. Five (7%) pts were transfused after study day 28. Twenty-six (38%) pts experienced serious adverse events (AEs). Eight (12%) pts experienced a clinically relevant thrombovascular event. Two (3%) pts discontinued due to AEs. Nine (13%) pts died during the study or within the 90-day follow-up period. These preliminary data suggest that initial dosing of EPO 60,000 U QW is associated with a hematopoietic response rate (Hb \u226512 g/dL or Hb increase \u22652 g/dL from BL) of ~75% in pts with cancer and anemia receiving CT, similar to the response rate reported historically for EPO 40,000 U SC QW with dose escalation to 60,000 U SC QW. In addition, among pts who achieved a target Hb \u226512 g/dL with QW dosing and then received Q3W maintenance dosing, EPO 80,000 U SC Q3W maintained mean Hb above 11 g/dL in >85% of pts."
