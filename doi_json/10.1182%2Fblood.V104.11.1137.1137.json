    "abstract_text": "Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is a severe complication occurring in patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation (SCT). Its therapy is based on general supportive procedures; however, even if these measures improve with time and new specific therapies are now available, chances of success continue to be scarce, and day + 100 mortality exceeds 50% in current series. Methods: In the DF-VOD trial, patients are being randomized to receive defibrotide (DF) or no treatment other than supportive and are followed-up for 100 days. Diagnosis of VOD is based on the Baltimore Criteria, and patients who do not meet them but have a biopsy or hemodinamically proven VOD are also eligible. Complete Response (CR) is defined as a bilirubin < 2 mg/dl and complete resolution of any other end-organ dysfunction. In this report, principal characteristics and the outcome of the whole cohort are described. Pre-SCT (age, gender, primary disease, conditioning, donor type) and clinical and laboratory characteristics at diagnosis of VOD (days from SCT to VOD, bilirubin and AST/ALT levels, and the presence of ascites and multiorgan failure (MOF)) were analyzed as prognostic factors by logistic regression models adjusted for treatment and other principal confounders. Results: Fifty-eight patients were randomized since October 2001, but 8 patients were excluded from the analysis because of missing data. Their principal characteristics at randomization and outcome are shown in table 1. The outcome of this cohort was found to be similar to that of Richardson\u2019s cohort of 78 patients, all treated with defibrotide, in which CR was 49% and day +100 survival was 42% ( Blood  2003 ; 102 : 193a ). Variables significantly associated with survival are shown in table 2. Conclusions: History of previous SCT, severe liver dysfunction denoted by high levels of bilirubin and AST/ALT, and the involvement of other organs seem to be independent risk factors for mortality in patients with VOD. The low survival in this population underlines the need of new treatment strategies. Randomization of patients in the DF-VOD trial is going on to produce clear evidence on the efficacy of defibrotide in this disease. Patients\u2019 characteristics and outcome  . N = 50 .
